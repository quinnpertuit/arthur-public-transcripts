"Va_x9Q0yYq8","0","6160"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here with your daily brief."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","6160","11080"," So I tried to make this morning's video and I have children and dogs."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","11080","14800"," Every video I've made this morning has been interrupted, which is kind of funny."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","14800","19280"," Like the key points in the video all of a sudden my dog will run by and start barking"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","19280","22520"," and then kids are giggling, that kind of stuff."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","22520","26080"," So I've had to make this video I think five times now."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","26080","28080"," Anyways, good morning."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","28080","31600"," Hope you're all waking up and happy."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","31600","36080"," We can see this morning that all of the news is positive in the markets."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","36080","40720"," We have three specters in the market right now."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","40720","45280"," Ever grand is on the back burner, not positive, but not negative at the moment."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","45280","52680"," We can see that the Pfizer is working, debt ceiling is solved, Russia problems are solved."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","52680","55240"," Everything is happy, happy, happy."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","55240","61000"," We do have two or three items on the table that lend volatility to the market."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","61000","68640"," We know that the economic calendar is thin, except for CPI on Friday at 8.30."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","68640","73760"," We know that the big event we've got ever grand on the back burner and then next week everybody"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","73760","79480"," knows about FOMC, that's on the 14th and 15th, that starts on Tuesday."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","79480","86200"," So you will see some form of consolidation the next few days into Friday, maybe some"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","86200","91560"," weakness on Friday, depending upon how the CPI numbers come out, will either send us"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","91560","95960"," lower or spring us up much higher."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","95960","100120"," Now we're going to take a look at some key numbers this morning."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","100120","107960"," The key pivots for you remain 4570 and 4700 on the SPY and then on the NQ, well, that's"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","107960","114760"," ES numbers, the SPY would be 457 and 470 on the SPY."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","114760","121000"," We can drill down under those numbers here in just a moment, NQ, 15, 700, 16, 5, 75 and"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","121000","129640"," then 386 and 400, the rest is the same thing, 2180 and 2260 and these should be our trading"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","129640","133760"," zones heading into the next of the upcoming days."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","133760","137920"," We're going to talk about the SPY this morning, I'm going to get rid of this for you here."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","138880","142560"," Trying to take a look at the weakness as we move forward."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","142560","146480"," Now I posted on Twitter earlier about a price target of this 480 above."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","146480","150480"," I saw Cred Swiss this morning, put out some crazy numbers of 520."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","150480","154480"," That does make sense for us to really try to get us to that 480."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","154480","158320"," If the news is really good on FOMC, maybe we do straight grind."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","159760","163440"," Sometimes, you know, like some years you'll see us grind straight up until the four o'clock"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","163440","168000"," hour on the 31st of December, bam, huge stupid highs."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","168960","177280"," For me, I think 478 is a reasonable number to be looking at for all-time highs or slightly"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","177280","179200"," below it, maybe we get up there and pull back."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","180240","187200"," I do want you to see this morning's support and resistance lines, we've got 466.21."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","187200","191840"," I don't expect us to sell off any deeper than that because because we did see the"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","191840","198720"," liquidity come up yesterday at the close and maybe the deepest we sell off to would be 463.94."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","199360","203520"," I do also want you to know that no matter what anyone's telling you out there, a lot of that"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","203520","204640"," data trade is over."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","205360","212400"," So you will see us try to exhaust sellers as we move through today, tomorrow, and then"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","212400","216880"," the weakness that we'll come into on Friday for CPI."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","216880","220640"," So maybe we start coming up here, swoop back down for Friday."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","220640","223360"," If the numbers are good, we make this rocket ship."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","223360","230560"," If not, we continue to sell down into weakness on Monday for the FOMC on Tuesday."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","230560","233920"," Now, let's say we take that rocket ship up and numbers are great on CPI."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","234720","237120"," You're still going to see that weakness on a Tuesday."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","237120","240480"," I would not be caught long on FOMC."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","241040","246160"," We can do some call hedging just before the start of an FOMC on Tuesday."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","246880","251120"," We've done this in the past and it usually prints nice and high."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","252080","258880"," So the plan would be for today, tomorrow, into Friday is for us to exhaust sellers above."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","258880","263040"," If you held calls in the overnight, I would take profit on the bell."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","263040","267040"," If you missed this green bar above here, let's look at this big giant green bar"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","267040","268640"," into the open this morning."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","268640","272720"," If there's nothing lost by you taking profit, I always recommend people."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","272720","278880"," You can let your runs long with great stops, but there are some moments in the market where"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","278880","284160"," you can expect volatility and this is going to be the case today in the spot."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","285520","288800"," One last note for this morning is going to be live streaming."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","288800","293600"," Last night, I started to build a dedicated rig with a dedicated computer."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","293600","297680"," I have to still throw up a second monitor so I can see you guys"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","298640","301200"," that are communicating with me via text message."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","302160","309840"," And for the opens and closes, I need to set this up so that I'm not switching back and forth"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","309840","312160"," and disturbing my day trading."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","312160","314480"," So that should be up and running this morning."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","314480","319040"," If not, it'll be up and running by the close today or I'll just get it up and running where"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","319040","323520"," you can't talk to me and I'll just talk to you about the open and the close where I'm looking"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","323520","328720"," to enter and exit and taking and closing trades with you throughout the day."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","328720","332080"," The last thing I wanted to say to this morning is the outpouring of, hey,"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","332080","334720"," doing a great job or we support you."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","334720","336480"," I really appreciate that as well."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","336480","341840"," You should see things become together to become more streamlined as time moves forward."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","341840","346560"," But in reality, I just want all of you out there to know that you've made my day and you've made"
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","346560","349280"," my week by the support that you've given me."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","349280","350560"," That's all I want you guys to know."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","350560","352240"," You guys are really awesome."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","352320","354560"," Twitter family, Ben Twitt, rocks."
"Va_x9Q0yYq8","354560","356400"," I'll see you out there this morning."
