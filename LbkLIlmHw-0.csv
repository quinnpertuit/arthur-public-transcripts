"246020","247080"," There's not enough time in the day."
"247320","252040"," The day the day needs to have like an extra eight hours in it or something."
"256320","266270"," So that I can get everything I need to get done every day done and that's not happening. "
"266850","268630"," I don't know what that is."
"268750","269050"," Hold on."
"272110","272850"," Copy that. "
"273110","273690"," Close that."
"277400","278440"," That up there."
"280600","281380"," On here. "
"283360","284800"," Okay, let's see if that works."
"287680","289320"," I think I did that wrong."
"290160","291300"," Yeah, that's whatever. "
"291360","292080"," Whatever that is."
"292980","294180"," I think I did the."
"294180","295960"," I think I did the. "
"296900","298720"," I think I'm a jiggy wrong."
"299260","301560"," Okay, I'll post that on on Twitter."
"303260","304780"," So let's take out. "
"304920","305720"," Let's do a quick review."
"307780","311360"," Of the reaction to the news this morning."
"312680","316800"," The economic news that came out and we'll talk about that. "
"328580","330120"," One quick second here."
"336570","339230"," So just let's talk about CPI really quick."
"339430","339890"," So CPI. "
"341430","349750"," All expectations are at 3.6%. Now it became in a 3.7% CPI year over years when I'm"
"349750","350370"," talking about."
"350790","352990"," Not too much of a difference."
"353670","354770"," There's a lot of talk about. "
"355770","360870"," Out there if we need one more rate increase."
"361530","363150"," Two more rate increases."
"364270","366150"," Jerome seem to be. "
"367290","368270"," Seemed to be."
"370910","373130"," Stating two things."
"373870","379770"," One to two more rate increases and way higher for longer. "
"381730","383510"," From my interpretation."
"384650","389770"," He was claiming that he'd be raising rates into December of 2024."
"391050","393890"," A high probability, high likelihood of that. "
"394090","394830"," We know that."
"396830","401890"," Rate increases and futures on that is saying hell no, that ain't happening."
"402070","404290"," You'll be cutting rates by springtime. "
"405270","410150"," There seems to be a big fight right now as well out there between banks."
"412490","415230"," Market participants betting against this."
"415870","418070"," Now it's been an ongoing thing, but. "
"418770","420090"," When you look at."
"420570","423210"," The rate of inflation when you look at."
"425430","428210"," The unemployment rate is really what matters. "
"429170","430630"," Key on the key in on that too."
"430830","433310"," The unemployment rate is the key."
"434950","438430"," Indicator so I don't conversation this morning on the phone. "
"440450","443270"," And with a friend and we were taught discussing."
"445590","447590"," What is tied to."
"448810","449810"," The stock market. "
"451510","455190"," And because on stream sometimes I'll say things like."
"456570","458570"," This is a hard thing to express."
"459270","462190"," What I want to express to you is a hard thing to express and. "
"464650","466730"," I've become jaded over the years."
"470710","473590"," Retailers go to places like Bloomberg."
"474070","475450"," They go to Twitter. "
"475810","477130"," They go to Wall Street Bats."
"477390","477810"," Stock to it."
"478150","479230"," It doesn't matter where you go. "
"479230","480870"," Go to Google news."
"481270","484570"," You got a market beat or whatever that is out there and."
"485550","487050"," We're all consuming. "
"488930","494990"," We're all consuming a narrative that's being fed to us and whatever narrative gains traction."
"497810","500310"," Is the is the prevailing narrative."
"501470","505550"," If it works out, it's assigned to that prevailing narrative. "
"505550","506570"," If it doesn't."
"508810","512150"," We give excuses right then or it disappears."
"512950","514210"," So you'll read a story. "
"515429","516710"," Let's say in the news."
"517330","520409"," And it gets it gains traction amongst retailers."
"522110","523970"," And it matters in that moment. "
"524550","528530"," And then the moment that price doesn't agree with that narrative."
"529430","531030"," We just forget about it."
"531710","535490"," That's the thing that I always noticed people just forget about the narrative that was told. "
"535490","538330"," They latch on to another narrative."
"539670","543130"," And until that narrative is proven or disproven."
"543710","547790"," And like there's no real causation or correlation, I should say. "
"548370","552970"," To these narratives that are produced in latched on to whenever they're wrong."
"554630","557870"," We just we just we just fucking move on to the next narrative."
"557870","559230"," It's it's kind of hilarious. "
"560530","561810"," To see this."
"562510","567050"," And I've removed myself from a lot of that narrative."
"569010","573650"," Like drinking that Kool-Aid and then discussing that Kool-Aid and validating that Kool-Aid. "
"574370","579270"," I've grown tired over the years of consuming it."
"580570","583670"," And as a matter of fact, when I was a young trader, I would latch on to it."
"584490","590930"," In my trading and some there was there have been times where I've been left behind. "
"590930","592130"," Now, this isn't recently."
"592410","593230"," This is years ago."
"593870","598470"," But there would be times where specifically buying stock. "
"598810","600330"," That was like the glaring example."
"601990","607690"," If one sector was was was just going to the moon, right?"
"608070","611050"," And if the stock market or the or the community."
"611050","616910"," The retail community was latched on to a specific sector or stock. "
"618310","624690"," And that ticker or sector was the darling child of the market, right?"
"625890","633390"," And you'd see like the money leave that sector or stock before prices changed."
"634530","639630"," And then all of a sudden the narrative switches over to this new sector or stock."
"640610","644470"," And kind of leaves behind what the talk of the town was. "
"646330","649110"," And like it just dies down."
"649630","651370"," The conversation dies down."
"651910","657910"," The money moves off into something new and nobody ever addresses the fact that a week before. "
"658750","663770"," That was the golden child, the darling child, the the heir apparent."
"664730","666870"," And that translates well into crashes."
"668350","670750"," Translates well into the narratives that are given. "
"671210","676150"," And earlier this week, someone in the stream was saying, we are tied to rates."
"677510","679010"," And like it didn't agree."
"679210","679890"," And then I agreed. "
"680090","681110"," And then I was like, fuck it."
"681150","681910"," I'm just going to agree."
"682850","685830"," And this isn't like a disparaging remark to that. "
"686530","690890"," Whether we are tied to the inverted yield curve or not."
"691110","693830"," But let's let's look at that."
"693830","697310"," I mean, if you look, if you bring up the inverted yield, if you bring up the yield curve in"
"697310","705710"," general, it is one of the worst fucking indicators for anyone to assign themselves to as the"
"705710","708890"," market, especially the equity market being tied to it. "
"709470","712310"," It's piss poor piss poor."
"713050","718210"," If you were to overlay a chart of the twos and tens over SPX or cues."
"721310","728090"," It's like if you look at it over the course, like 10, 10 years or so, you can't see shit. "
"728510","728870"," It doesn't."
"729070","732650"," It like sometimes it's in line with with the equity market."
"732670","733950"," Sometimes it's not. "
"735050","737270"," And so it's a piss poor indicator."
"740190","743550"," And as a matter of fact, if you look at just TLT."
"744550","746210"," Is somewhat better. "
"747430","749250"," A way to look at it."
"749310","752890"," But even that you can't overlay it on a chart and say, this looks exact right."
"754450","757710"," To to to what the yield curve is. "
"757870","757990"," So."
"759690","761630"," It's fascinating to me because."
"765210","770330"," You know, price action is king and price action will. "
"771630","774630"," Are destroys narratives day in, day out."
"775530","782130"," Week in, week out, year after year, where it just doesn't matter, you know, it's not really why the"
"782130","784050"," market's going up and the market's not going down."
"784490","785850"," And to that point. "
"786690","789490"," I want to bring up with the invasion."
"789970","796070"," The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the market was already."
"797190","798030"," Positioned. "
"798710","801870"," For a downside move when that took place."
"803970","808110"," Banks were positioned for that news to come out and."
"808670","815330"," What's also fascinating about that is if you look back when the USSR was collapsing. "
"816950","823290"," There are many books written about Goldman Sachs in particular."
"824010","833010"," Having offices in Moscow during the collapse of the USSR. And so they knew when the fall was coming"
"833010","834670"," when it was going to happen. "
"835390","841130"," What the mechanics were from the economic side of things within Russia within USSR. They were"
"841130","842550"," actually buying up stock."
"845170","848930"," From oil and gas companies like they were buying it from. "
"848930","852610"," Mafioso literal gangsters."
"853730","857450"," Now we know that GS does not have a fucking office."
"858030","860690"," In the in the Gaza Strip do they?"
"861010","863710"," We know that there's no GS office. "
"863910","865150"," There's no JPM office."
"865810","871570"," There's no, you know, Mike Wilson doesn't have a back office with some guy."
"872270","874250"," In the Gaza Strip, right?"
"874450","874790"," We know that. "
"874790","877090"," So we also can likely."
"878390","881050"," We can actually assign."
"884280","889000"," That this was likely unknown that Hamas did not call. "
"889380","894620"," Their guy at JPM and say, Hey, by the way, we're going to pull this shit over the weekend."
"897810","900930"," So our equity markets was bottoming."
"900930","906630"," We were at the end oversold at the we were around in the corner and you've got banks going. "
"906630","906950"," All right."
"907070","907310"," Fuck it."
"907310","907890"," We're going to go long. "
"908250","909110"," It's that simple."
"909570","911870"," Everyone tries to make things so complicated."
"913230","917850"," GS had released a statement that they were net seller of equities. "
"919070","924630"," Heading into last week at some point and then GS released a statement that they were net buyers and"
"924630","925590"," sellers of puts."
"926450","927070"," So."
"930170","932870"," We see the invasion this past weekend. "
"932870","940490"," And it's like lifting the skirt up of market equity market participants."
"941790","946890"," And showing that when they don't have the insider information."
"948230","951950"," They do not react to that news most times. "
"952170","952870"," Sometimes they do."
"952990","954430"," We know that at 9 11, they did."
"955290","958130"," And people got hurt right in the equity market over that. "
"958250","964290"," We know that there are times when that does happen, but we can see specifically that that did not"
"964290","966470"," happen this past week."
"967390","970690"," And they did not know in advance of this taking place."
"971290","972530"," That's the key point here. "
"973090","973430"," And so."
"973790","976830"," For them to for banks to be prepared for that."
"977510","979130"," They have to get ready for it. "
"979170","983810"," It's fine liquidity to price those events in and not only that."
"984590","986550"," It leads into the question of."
"986550","991170"," When does this the war with Israel and Hamas matter?"
"992130","993010"," When will it matter?"
"993730","995010"," When will it be priced in?"
"996990","998470"," And where will it be?"
"998730","999970"," Will it be priced in?"
"1000150","1003170"," And we talked about this in the past couple of weeks past week or so. "
"1003170","1004050"," I've talked to you about."
"1004870","1006350"," You have the initial reaction."
"1006750","1009510"," You have the initial active duty forces that react. "
"1009910","1010370"," They did that."
"1010930","1012330"," You have that then you have the call up."
"1012430","1014330"," It takes about two weeks to take place. "
"1014330","1016830"," This isn't any modern military."
"1017090","1021350"," It takes it takes weeks minimum of two weeks minimum."
"1022410","1027329"," Well, and then you have the rest of those forces that need to be trained up retrained. "
"1027910","1030790"," That shit can take six weeks, nine weeks."
"1031270","1034030"," Even if you even if you fast track it, it takes weeks."
"1034589","1037089"," If to make sure that people are fit for combat, you have to make sure that. "
"1038170","1041670"," You're filling roles and units, all this other shit in the background."
"1041670","1044849"," Then you got logistics that need to be taken care of."
"1045210","1047170"," And you have a doctrine change in Israel. "
"1048870","1051270"," And so that takes time now."
"1052150","1053670"," The market knows this."
"1053850","1055310"," They've got some time to react. "
"1055650","1059410"," And we already had that small quick grace period for a few days."
"1060390","1065810"," And we're coming into the first milestone of calling soldiers."
"1067370","1071210"," Airmen, naval personnel, whatever they've got over there in Israel back there. "
"1071350","1073650"," We're coming into that next phase."
"1074650","1076850"," So tomorrow the 11th."
"1077970","1079850"," Into the 15th. "
"1080290","1084050"," Now, I don't have the Twitter post in Fermi."
"1084110","1085610"," I wish I did this morning, but I don't."
"1086290","1088510"," But there's a great military. "
"1089090","1091190"," There's a great there's a guy on Twitter."
"1091370","1092870"," I'll try to find him this morning for you."
"1093570","1096130"," And I'll get that post to you today. "
"1096370","1098410"," But he came up with the same kind of an idea."
"1099150","1103230"," To expect the next phase in this war to begin."
"1103970","1108350"," Right around the 11th to the 15th of October. "
"1108570","1113590"," So starting tomorrow into Monday."
"1115110","1117810"," It could be become priced in."
"1117930","1120850"," You could begin to see the next phase of pricing in. "
"1120850","1123990"," We had a little bit of weakness the morning that that Monday morning."
"1124170","1127610"," But I think you need to be and I need to be aware."
"1128470","1134830"," Are still still conscience of when this next phase of war begins. "
"1136470","1139610"," It begins to escalate intensify and ramp up."
"1140050","1142070"," It could take place."
"1143230","1147410"," Into this weekend and into Monday, Sunday and Monday. "
"1147410","1155170"," So I want you to be aware of that as we start to go up in price and become not"
"1155170","1159130"," overbought, not oversold, but you know, we're kind of like in a place where you can short the"
"1159130","1161430"," market and price that stuff in."
"1161710","1167970"," There was some information coming out yesterday that I went over last night after the show ended."
"1168150","1174390"," I was doing some research and some of what I've said sounds like it could potentially happen. "
"1174390","1176630"," We're going to explore that briefly here."
"1176810","1184130"," But Qatar yesterday threatened to we know we've got water being shut off, electricity being shut"
"1184130","1184390"," off."
"1184710","1187390"," Qatar is threatening to cut off the world gas supply. "
"1188330","1193030"," That would be that would be something that matters to the stock market."
"1193510","1199450"," And you also have some threats against the United States if hostilities continue."
"1200290","1204770"," So if you see a ramp and you also have something I don't talk about here, but the. "
"1207390","1208570"," It's called like the."
"1209610","1210670"," It's called right now."
"1210710","1212750"," It's called having a mind block right now. "
"1213370","1215310"," Basically, it's the intensity of warfare."
"1217110","1218610"," And I'll get I'll bring this."
"1218750","1220370"," I'll give this stuff to you later this morning. "
"1220790","1223830"," I'll give you the I'll give you a site the sources for this morning, but."
"1224590","1227210"," To set it in the stream before, which is mowing the lawn."
"1227510","1229150"," We're not mowing the lawn anymore, right?"
"1230810","1232370"," Violence of action, right?"
"1232570","1238210"," I think it's called violence of action and Israel is going to use that that doctrine. "
"1238950","1242710"," In the coming weeks, like this weekend, next couple weeks."
"1243570","1246870"," And some of the stuff that I've discussed with you would be some kind of some kind of a deal"
"1246870","1249850"," between Saudi Arabia."
"1249850","1255770"," This wouldn't shock me a deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel to continue. "
"1256970","1259770"," And some kind of a some kind of a."
"1260290","1269270"," Like a like a like a like a backstabbing of Hamas in particular and possibly even forcing Qatar to"
"1269270","1269730"," come in line."
"1270170","1272170"," You get guitar you got Saudi Arabia."
"1272450","1276490"," They're trying to whitewash their past trying to join the modern world. "
"1276490","1279370"," They're building these these crazy cities."
"1279670","1283990"," You've got you've got a Saudi Arabia becoming an art capital of the world."
"1283990","1289930"," You've got soccer and golf and all of these things that parts of the Arab and Muslim world are"
"1289930","1292150"," trying to become a part of the world economy. "
"1292450","1296410"," And then you've got some countries you got a country like Afghanistan."
"1297230","1299730"," You know, if they just do their thing in Afghanistan, no big deal."
"1299970","1302090"," They don't cause any huge worldwide disturbances. "
"1302090","1303290"," Nobody cares."
"1303990","1309050"," And you've got Hamas trying to disrupt this process of modernizing the Middle East."
"1309770","1314790"," And if they're if they're like if they're crushed in that and that trying to disrupt that"
"1314790","1322970"," modernization of the Middle East, you could see some really crazy stuff happen in the coming days"
"1322970","1325710"," and weeks as time passes. "
"1325710","1333310"," So I want you to keep this on your palate in an awareness of this as we head into the"
"1333310","1335070"," 11th through the 15th."
"1335250","1338490"," We could extend into the 18th of October."
"1338490","1345270"," So keep that on your mind as we head into this coming weekend and then next week. "
"1345510","1348810"," And it's not so much if this stuff gets ramped up."
"1349070","1351910"," It's does it drag in the world economy?"
"1351910","1353830"," Does it drag in the United States?"
"1353830","1355610"," Does it drag in the United States?"
"1356010","1358850"," And maybe there's a trap for Iran."
"1359210","1361510"," There's a trap for Lebanon. "
"1361510","1364290"," There's a trap for the Gaza Strip."
"1365790","1367430"," That's unknown, right?"
"1367730","1371170"," We don't see publicly that there are deals being brokered in the background."
"1371510","1379430"," You saw the Arabic League League meeting between Russia between Putin and those got both of that"
"1379430","1380190"," group and Putin. "
"1380190","1385850"," So there's a lot of mechanics, political ramifications in the background happening that we don't"
"1385850","1387190"," see is my point."
"1387810","1395370"," And I think we might be surprised as to its outcome in the coming days and weeks."
"1395630","1401730"," I know it's a long shot, but there's other things that are going on in the world that are going"
"1401730","1407230"," against this being the usual mowing the grass that Israel does, right?"
"1407230","1413970"," Every, every decade or two and something else fascinating in this whole thing with Israel and"
"1413970","1414190"," Hamas. "
"1415450","1417190"," Yes, it was on a phone call again."
"1417510","1423310"," I was it turned into let's check out the demographics of the Gaza Strip."
"1423930","1427330"," And so we went down a rabbit hole checking out all the demographics of the Gaza Strip and it was"
"1427330","1430650"," fascinating to see the size of their population. "
"1431530","1437570"," And the and the median and average age of their population is very low."
"1438110","1447150"," So when you look at when you look at the Gaza Strip, they have a very young average age"
"1447150","1450470"," and their population is bursting at the seams."
"1451870","1461150"," So if you're looking at it from that perspective, in the coming decade or so, there's going to be a"
"1461150","1468890"," population explosion in the Gaza Strip, like explosion in the Gaza Strip. "
"1469090","1476970"," So just looking at those things, those demographics of the population in that small area."
"1479110","1484330"," It's it's it's just screaming that something needs to be done."
"1484810","1490870"," There needs to be some kind of a solution, even if it's not dealt with, or even if this didn't"
"1490870","1492170"," happen this past weekend. "
"1493470","1495510"," There's going to be a reckoning over that."
"1495790","1501970"," You're not you can't have four three million four million people in the Strip in the next."
"1502670","1504490"," Five years, 10 years, right?"
"1505030","1506670"," You have that great population explosion. "
"1506730","1510630"," So they probably know that something has to be done."
"1511190","1517790"," And even these larger nations in the Middle East probably know that something's going to be the"
"1517790","1521790"," trigger, the fire, whatever that is, is going to ignite at some point."
"1522230","1526170"," Even if it didn't happen this past weekend, it's going to happen. "
"1526870","1533730"," And that the and that the standard doctrine for the Strip likely would not work anyways in the"
"1533730","1535910"," coming one to three to five years."
"1537050","1539330"," So a solution would need to be found."
"1539570","1542970"," And so I just find it fascinating that's happening right now. "
"1543290","1547610"," And then if it didn't happen, it still likely would have happened."
"1548450","1553170"," And Israel's probably aware of this surrounding nations are probably aware of this."
"1553310","1558910"," I even saw talk yesterday about Egypt taking in some of these taking in some of these non"
"1558910","1562730"," combatants and increased aid to Egypt. "
"1563050","1567810"," And this is a nation that we say is never going to take any of these Palestinians in."
"1568130","1573090"," And I'm I likely think that a lot of these nations in the Middle East will take in these non"
"1573090","1573570"," combatants."
"1574070","1576630"," Europe will likely take in more of these non combatants. "
"1577610","1580130"," The U.S. will likely take in more of these non combatants."
"1580730","1582950"," And how do you how do you find a solution to this?"
"1583310","1588990"," If Israel's saying there's going to be a solution, you know what the only real solution is what you"
"1588990","1590050"," know it and I know it."
"1590330","1594090"," You and I both know that it's a matter of poverty. "
"1595030","1599410"," It's a matter of education, right?"
"1600010","1601790"," Education and poverty."
"1601790","1602890"," We know that."
"1603010","1603810"," We know that. "
"1604390","1608790"," As a matter of fact, where I'm living, I live in Detroit and Michigan, right?"
"1608930","1609750"," This is where I live now."
"1610010","1615950"," There was a protest vigil in a place called Dearborn Michigan."
"1616350","1622530"," I believe it was yesterday of the day before and they had video and pictures of Palestinians"
"1622530","1624270"," holding this vigil. "
"1625230","1627270"," And you know, they were supporting Palestinians."
"1627270","1634490"," And the one key takeaway that I took from that from the images and the reporting that was going on"
"1634490","1635230"," from Dearborn."
"1636390","1641570"," Was these Palestinians in Dearborn are supporting people. "
"1642390","1645610"," But they're not willing to go back to Palestine either, right?"
"1645710","1648030"," They're not willing to go back to the Gaza Strip either."
"1648750","1651550"," These people have been afforded a better life."
"1651910","1653590"," They've been afforded education. "
"1653590","1658030"," They've been afforded a de-radicalization."
"1658910","1665550"," And if Israel's saying they're going to do these things, that would seem to me like it's the only"
"1665550","1666150"," solution."
"1667270","1670210"," When you have a young person, right?"
"1670330","1671150"," A young child. "
"1672410","1673890"," And they're impoverished."
"1675590","1677870"," They are not educated."
"1678870","1680310"," And they're fed. "
"1682110","1683670"," You know, radicalizing material."
"1684950","1691650"," Radicalizing only certain sections of Bible, Quran, stuff like that."
"1691970","1693910"," This happens no matter what religion you are. "
"1694530","1695190"," You see this with Christians."
"1696530","1697870"," You can see it with cults."
"1698510","1699690"," You can see it with atheists. "
"1700210","1700670"," It doesn't matter."
"1701750","1706510"," When you deprive people of their access to wealth, education."
"1706510","1711470"," Then you feed them what you want them to have, right?"
"1711690","1712710"," To radicalize them. "
"1713130","1715550"," You can make people do whatever you want, right?"
"1715710","1718150"," You can turn them into a veritable monster."
"1718570","1725810"," So the only solution that I can see here is that you remove these people from being impoverished."
"1725810","1727150"," You educate them. "
"1727850","1728970"," You give them a better life."
"1730110","1738110"," So if that's a part of that plan with Israel, if they're shifting their doctrine, then if you see"
"1738110","1743870"," these nations that are trying to join the world like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, nations with money and"
"1743870","1749710"," looking towards their future, it seems to me like if this is that moment where you can have that"
"1749710","1750770"," opportunity to do that."
"1751390","1753370"," You know, you let the fighters fight. "
"1754130","1755310"," You let the combatants combat."
"1756050","1763230"," But then you have to step in at the same time and try to change the lives of these people"
"1763810","1765770"," so they don't become radicalized."
"1766050","1768850"," There's a prime example of this even in the United States. "
"1769410","1774570"," In Dearborn, Michigan, there's a very large Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian population."
"1775630","1776750"," And these people live in peace."
"1777510","1778430"," These people have jobs. "
"1778830","1779370"," They have education."
"1780650","1781750"," They're not radicalized."
"1782070","1784770"," There's no crazy shit going on in Dearborn, Michigan. "
"1785150","1788050"," Now, there's some shit that people get pissed off about around the nation."
"1788050","1789430"," They pop up in national news."
"1790130","1791530"," But you don't see that stuff. "
"1791530","1797370"," So if you want to end that, if this is real, if Israel wants to end that, that's what has"
"1797370","1798150"," to happen, right?"
"1798350","1804990"," You go in and you literally, just like Germany, just like Japan, you do some damage."
"1805170","1811050"," And you remove the noncombatants and you kind of have to take them out of poverty and kind of have"
"1811050","1815570"," to educate them and give them opportunity to not radicalize."
"1815710","1816710"," So I'm hoping that happens. "
"1817130","1818610"," That would be my hope if I had a hope."
"1818610","1825010"," You should be aware of that as the weekend progresses into next week."
"1825510","1827510"," That it doesn't grow out of control. "
"1828450","1831690"," That we don't, we don't drag in Iran."
"1832070","1833410"," We don't drag in Lebanon."
"1833810","1840110"," We don't drag in Qatar threatening to cut off the gas for the rest of the world and stuff like"
"1840110","1840410"," that. "
"1840630","1846270"," That people begin to play ball and they find some kind of a real true solution to what's going on"
"1846270","1847550"," in the Middle East."
"1847550","1851390"," Now this morning, the market, let's talk about the market really quick."
"1852430","1861270"," So number one, I want you to be conscious of this, of this war stuff as we head into next,"
"1861270","1863330"," into the weekend and then into Monday. "
"1864050","1865210"," Be aware of it."
"1865710","1872410"," If you wake up on Monday morning and the markets down to 100, 300 points because some crazy shit"
"1872410","1872930"," went down."
"1872930","1877510"," I don't want to see you on stream and chat saying, I didn't see this coming. "
"1878850","1879330"," Right?"
"1879450","1881790"," If something crazy happens over the weekend."
"1886560","1889700"," Meanwhile, right now you're seeing the hourly trigger hold."
"1890940","1895980"," And I was talking to a friend this morning on the, I was talking to a friend this morning and"
"1895980","1898800"," he was scared this morning. "
"1898840","1902360"," He saw the, the economic news come out and it was slightly hot."
"1902360","1909720"," And then he was like, hey, the, the, the yield curve is going to impact the market this morning."
"1911780","1915440"," And I, all I said to him was, where's price?"
"1916580","1919420"," Price is above the hourly trigger, right?"
"1920540","1923040"," That's the place that you price above the hourly trigger, right?"
"1923220","1926700"," So price right now above the hourly trigger, still above the hourly trigger. "
"1927360","1931280"," We then have the hourly trigger, the daily trigger, and then we have the weekly trigger."
"1931960","1932320"," Right?"
"1932460","1937200"," We know something this, this, this, we can, we can figure something out about this."
"1938200","1942900"," That markets are stable when we have that condition. "
"1943860","1950560"," We also know that we can buy the hourly trigger whenever we come back to revisit it."
"1950620","1952880"," So if we come back down here, right?"
"1953720","1954760"," We touch the hourly trigger."
"1954900","1957260"," We know that we can buy the hourly trigger, right?"
"1957260","1964140"," And until that fails, until that hourly trigger fails, we're following trend. "
"1964680","1968100"," So price goes up above, comes back down, you buy that."
"1968700","1972140"," And only if it begins to break down, do you put your stops in?"
"1974100","1976780"," Then you start to get bearish, right?"
"1981310","1986210"," If we begin to reject and start to head to the downside, that has not happened yet, has it?"
"1986210","1993830"," So this is the assignments of news, the assignments of pieces or traction that you get on bullshit"
"1993830","1995290"," stories on social media."
"1995790","1997090"," They don't mean shit. "
"1997850","1999030"," They don't mean anything."
"1999350","2004070"," And if they don't, if the, if the market doesn't go the way that your thesis that you're consuming"
"2004070","2008270"," on social media and on Bloomberg and where the fuck else it is that you get your information."
"2009050","2016390"," So if price bounces off, bounces, if it bounces off the hourly trigger, you forget that whole"
"2016390","2021790"," narrative that you had and you create a new narrative, right?"
"2021950","2024870"," Or you say bad news is good news, whatever it is that you say. "
"2025590","2033450"," The great part about this system is it disregards all the shit that you're out there consuming."
"2034850","2037490"," It disregards all the news that you're consuming."
"2037950","2042650"," It disregards all of the rumors that you're consuming. "
"2042650","2047330"," It disregards social media and retailers and all that other shit."
"2047730","2052409"," As long as you've got price here, you've got, it's above the hourly trigger."
"2052830","2053889"," It's above the daily trigger. "
"2054070","2054929"," It's above the weekly trigger."
"2056050","2059070"," You stay on track and you buy that hourly trigger."
"2059670","2064969"," If it begins to fail and break down and start to head down right to the daily trigger, you can"
"2064969","2066230"," take that short if you want. "
"2066909","2068150"," That's intraday trend."
"2068150","2073230"," And then if you see the hourly cross the daily or the daily cross the weekly, you get more and"
"2073230","2075489"," more bearish and more and more in cell mode."
"2075830","2078429"," But until that happens, you're still buying the hourly trigger. "
"2078770","2084150"," Regardless of news, regardless of bullshit, regardless of your thesis, regardless of the crap that"
"2084150","2089570"," you're regurgitating, that you read on somebody's fucking report last night or whatever the fuck it"
"2089570","2092850"," is that's out there that's telling you all this bad shit is coming."
"2092850","2098310"," It's useless and it's worthless when you have this tool."
"2098550","2106110"," This tool, the more that you have this tool, the more that you start realizing that, it doesn't"
"2106110","2106910"," fucking matter. "
"2108230","2113070"," All the chatter that's out there for why this and why that."
"2114050","2116910"," What truthfully happens is you see the bounce this morning, right?"
"2117610","2120730"," Nice, beautiful bounce, boom, boom, and it's holding right now."
"2120730","2124010"," We're actually holding above the gamma flip right now as well. "
"2124190","2129750"," So until that changes, until you start to see price break through the hourly trigger, then you see"
"2129750","2132930"," the hourly trigger racing down and breaking through the daily trigger, the daily trigger is"
"2132930","2135070"," breaking down through the weekly trigger."
"2135510","2136030"," You got nothing."
"2136930","2137930"," You got nothing. "
"2139310","2140590"," And it's holding right now."
"2140730","2146770"," So if we begin to break down and start to reject, right, we're watching it right here, no rejection"
"2146770","2150950"," here, you would have been looking for this to reject here and start heading lower."
"2151150","2151750"," We didn't see that. "
"2152070","2153130"," We squeezed up, right?"
"2153770","2154670"," Broke down a little bit."
"2154750","2155810"," They tried to sell it again."
"2156430","2158010"," Unsuccessful, right?"
"2158310","2159630"," Still no chance there. "
"2160150","2161930"," So we'll pay attention to it."
"2162330","2166470"," If we begin to see price break down below the hourly trigger, right?"
"2167010","2168990"," If we begin to, we see demand right here, right?"
"2169110","2170530"," You see demand here, demand here."
"2170890","2173890"," This is telling you that currently buyers are still here. "
"2176710","2184190"," Now, if buyers show up this morning and don't do this, let's continue to buy this dip, right?"
"2184270","2185250"," We start to roll down."
"2185390","2186510"," Let's say we're rolled down right here."
"2188430","2189790"," We break down, right?"
"2189950","2192550"," We begin to trade this, right?"
"2193710","2194830"," We begin to reject. "
"2195130","2195950"," That's the key point."
"2196130","2198070"," Reject, right?"
"2198390","2198850"," That level."
"2199350","2201710"," Sure, we'll take the short and go down with it to the daily trigger. "
"2202550","2212980"," Even then, if you see that and you don't see the indicators following, let's"
"2212980","2214100"," show this in a 30 minute chart."
"2218940","2222380"," If you see price break down below the hourly trigger, right?"
"2222540","2228320"," Below the daily trigger and you don't see the hourly following, right?"
"2228440","2230300"," You don't see the green line following down."
"2230560","2232980"," You don't see the yellow line following down. "
"2233160","2235460"," You don't see the orange line following down."
"2235800","2241100"," If you just see price break down, but none of these things are following, you should see a squeeze"
"2241100","2241740"," back up."
"2242180","2244020"," It's like a momentary kind of a thing, right?"
"2244020","2246640"," We have plenty of examples of this. "
"2247160","2250920"," Let me show you two key ones right now."
"2252940","2255480"," I want you to see the difference here, right?"
"2256860","2258000"," Let me show you this."
"2258160","2258400"," Hold on here. "
"2262160","2267380"," Let me get a better example of this or a way to show this in a better light."
"2268740","2270800"," I want to show you this right here."
"2270800","2277220"," I want you to see this yellow line right here, okay?"
"2277760","2281580"," I want you to see price going down. "
"2281800","2287300"," Here's an example of price going down, price going down, price going down, and yet this yellow line"
"2287300","2288180"," is not following."
"2288380","2291760"," It's just continuing, continuing, continuing, right?"
"2292000","2293900"," But here you see the break below."
"2295360","2297120"," There's a stark difference here. "
"2297480","2299340"," Price dropping, but not the yellow line."
"2299580","2301300"," Price dropping, but not the yellow line."
"2301300","2305160"," Price dropping, yellow line follows, that's bad, right?"
"2306120","2308300"," Super bad, right?"
"2309080","2313180"," There's bad exes there, bad juju, bad stuff, bad, bad, bad, right?"
"2314560","2316380"," Over here, not so bad, is it?"
"2316640","2318860"," Yellow line not following, yellow line not following. "
"2319080","2320560"," No reason to panic, just a correction."
"2321500","2325140"," And so far where we are right now, we're still threading that needle."
"2326000","2328060"," There has been no cross. "
"2328720","2330260"," You see it right here?"
"2330500","2333840"," Yellow line has not followed down, has it?"
"2334040","2335660"," Does not blast it through here yet?"
"2335880","2337800"," It can, but it has not yet."
"2338580","2340880"," Price is not down there yet either."
"2341080","2346040"," And if price goes down, but the yellow line does not follow, there shouldn't be much room. "
"2347080","2348860"," There shouldn't be too much concern."
"2350560","2356100"," Okay, so even if we roll down in price, if the yellow line is continuing higher, even though price"
"2356100","2361880"," is down there, we would expect a squeeze back up and a continuation to the upside in the"
"2361880","2362180"," marketplace."
"2362820","2364660"," So be aware of that in the coming days. "
"2365480","2367240"," Be aware of it today, be aware of it tomorrow."
"2368300","2373040"," Now, intraday, we're going to look at the one minute chart in the intraday."
"2384230","2386110"," And we're going to pay attention to this. "
"2386330","2388210"," We're going to pay attention to price here."
"2388430","2392030"," If price begins to reject, that would mean what?"
"2392030","2400110"," You're looking for, you're looking for, if you're a seller or even a bull that's scared, you're"
"2400110","2401630"," looking for price to break down."
"2403010","2405670"," We always talk about this is a higher time frame, right?"
"2405790","2412470"," Well, not really a higher time frame, but you're looking for price to break down, come back up and"
"2412470","2416030"," reject, not do this, not do that. "
"2416710","2419070"," We want to see failure of buyers."
"2419070","2424470"," We want to see buyers not have that will, right?"
"2425010","2427470"," This failure here is the will of buyers weakening."
"2427970","2433270"," So you're looking for that action to actually trade that downside move to the daily trigger. "
"2433670","2436130"," Right now, price coming down again to retest that hourly trigger."
"2436630","2438470"," So you're going to be looking for the failure."
"2438750","2443030"," So if you see the break here of the hourly trigger, one, two, three, right?"
"2443610","2449010"," And then if you see another squeeze higher, one, two, three, right?"
"2449010","2451370"," Here, and it doesn't squeeze above. "
"2451410","2453350"," It just begins to immediately reject."
"2453650","2459530"," Have your finger on the spy, you know, like the spy fucking put button and just slam it or the"
"2459530","2461270"," cell ES button."
"2461390","2468550"," Have it ready to go, but do not take it until you see the actual rejection right on that, on"
"2468550","2469190"," that green line. "
"2469190","2469510"," Okay."
"2469930","2471530"," You need to see the rejection here."
"2471730","2473610"," You need to see the break and the rejection. "
"2474050","2476730"," You don't want to see these big squeezes to the upside."
"2477530","2481650"," Another fascinating thing about this morning is let's look at Apple."
"2481770","2482930"," What did Apple do this morning?"
"2483010","2484530"," It squeezed right on the open. "
"2485050","2488270"," You watch tech this morning squeezed on the open."
"2488850","2494710"," So until we see that, until we see that break rejection on the hourly trigger, not really too"
"2494710","2497490"," concerned here, not too concerned here."
"2508680","2510220"," Dude, who is that?"
"2512980","2513820"," Torn dish. "
"2513820","2514180"," Hello."
"2514360","2515400"," Sorry for bothering you."
"2515480","2520640"," I want to offer promotion of your channel viewers, followers, views, chat bots, et cetera. "
"2520640","2522580"," The price is lower than anybody any competitor."
"2522960","2528460"," The quality is guaranteed to be the best flexible and convenient order management panel."
"2528760","2530560"," Everything is in your hands. "
"2530880","2532060"," Turn it on and off customize."
"2532940","2533920"," Go to stream rise."
"2533920","2539000"," Are you can somebody go out and one of the fucking moderators ban that motherfucker. "
"2539540","2541760"," Can somebody ban that torn dish person?"
"2542860","2543280"," Anybody."
"2543540","2544420"," Do I got to turn the God?"
"2544580","2546640"," Do I got to turn the goddamn subscriber shit on again?"
"2547000","2548660"," Somebody go out there and ban that motherfucker."
"2549060","2550820"," Torn dishes, ban that guy. "
"2552400","2554140"," Anybody out there can ban that guy?"
"2554240","2554700"," You mean to do it?"
"2555400","2555880"," That's right."
"2556080","2557180"," Whoever did that, congratulations."
"2558380","2559100"," Who just banned that guy?"
"2559200","2560260"," Was that you poke the juice box?"
"2560520","2560820"," Good job. "
"2562060","2563100"," Ban that motherfucker."
"2564120","2565660"," I don't sell it to anybody."
"2565660","2571280"," I don't pay for traction or by viewers or any of that shit. "
"2571480","2572180"," I don't do it on Twitter."
"2572360","2574260"," I don't do it on any social media."
"2574620","2577900"," So I don't give a fuck if one person shows up to this stream. "
"2577900","2579860"," If it's we one of the person, that's what we'll do."
"2583140","2584540"," Ban that motherfucker."
"2587660","2588680"," Good job, moderators. "
"2594480","2598220"," No, saying all of what I just ranted about."
"2600360","2602460"," Saying everything that I just ranted about here."
"2603060","2605480"," Let's take a look at Weebull really quick. "
"2605780","2608720"," And I want you to know that we are short by up here."
"2608740","2613560"," So just keep your eye on this, even though I'm ranting and saying, Hey, we haven't sold the hourly"
"2613560","2614160"," trigger yet."
"2614860","2616220"," Keep your eye on this here. "
"2617480","2619040"," Market is still short, right?"
"2619300","2620380"," I want you to be aware of that."
"2621600","2623160"," We have not had a turn to the upside."
"2623160","2624140"," And one more thing. "
"2624260","2627660"," I want to show you traditional stuff going to Weebull really quick."
"2628380","2630320"," I want you to see a couple things."
"2630500","2631240"," There's a one minute chart. "
"2631940","2640460"," We always talk about the second or third bear cross and how nasty they can get."
"2640660","2642860"," So you had your first bear cross up here."
"2643620","2645200"," Right first one right here. "
"2645320","2645840"," You can see it."
"2646600","2650860"," But then you're getting this cross down here and this last cross right here."
"2651240","2653220"," So I would be really weary here. "
"2653880","2657060"," If you're a bull and you're trying to buy a dip here."
"2658140","2665100"," You can you can attempt to dip a dip by only when you get the bull cross here."
"2665800","2667720"," And currently we don't have that. "
"2668060","2671200"," We actually have a cross showing up on the trigger screen here."
"2671200","2673740"," So this is the one you want to pay attention to."
"2673980","2679760"," Not the crappy EMA's that you guys try to hack at home. "
"2680420","2684600"," So I know some of you guys are hacking like 21, 27 EMA's, 129, 126."
"2686260","2687840"," So right here you see the cross."
"2688000","2689620"," I want to show you the double cross right here. "
"2690620","2693520"," So here's a cross right there."
"2693960","2694900"," See it right there."
"2695560","2697920"," So there's the big cross, the white cross and the red line. "
"2698300","2700380"," You might not have that cross at home yet."
"2700380","2702420"," And you are on the hourly trigger."
"2702660","2709380"," So if this does happen, you're going to be looking for weakness from bull. "
"2709660","2713960"," So right where we are, you're going to look for this green bar, right?"
"2714080","2716320"," You want to see this green bar not go any higher."
"2716880","2722580"," You want to see red bars follow right down here, straight down underneath."
"2723260","2727220"," And then you want to see more weakness by buyers. "
"2727800","2731220"," And a failure on buyers right on that hourly trigger."
"2731380","2732520"," You see that failure right there?"
"2732620","2735400"," If you see that, it's going to be on to the downside."
"2735860","2740900"," You're going to see this roll here and we'll go down. "
"2742180","2748500"," So pay attention to where we are right now on your charts."
"2752980","2754080"," I'm like, damn that."
"2755600","2759240"," Hey, thanks JR2717. "
"2759520","2759940"," I love you, man."
"2760060","2761540"," I appreciate all the support and the love, brother."
"2762520","2765080"," So keep your eyes on this on this bar, right?"
"2765200","2768300"," It's an important bar for you to see if we get a reversal of the upside, if we get a"
"2768300","2770140"," rejection to the downside. "
"2770680","2772180"," Now there is some stuff to talk about."
"2773020","2778480"," If we go to gamma, the gamma readings for this morning, right?"
"2778480","2779480"," On SPX."
"2779780","2780520"," Let's spy. "
"2780700","2781580"," We're going to go to SPX."
"2783240","2789740"," If you go to the gamma readings for this morning, here is the gamma flip right here and you see"
"2789740","2791000"," us fighting with, right?"
"2791340","2793420"," So this is the gamma flip right here."
"2794360","2798280"," You can see us parked right on the gamma flip, right?"
"2799160","2801260"," So gamma at least, we're parked right here. "
"2801940","2802900"," No decisions yet."
"2803700","2808040"," We are the bullish above this 46 M in this gamma flip."
"2808040","2808540"," You see it?"
"2808920","2810480"," Today I'm going to show it to you right now. "
"2811220","2813700"," If we begin to lose this gamma flip, right?"
"2814200","2816600"," We begin to reject the downside, right?"
"2817020","2819020"," And we fail to get back above it."
"2819480","2824420"," So if we break below this gamma flip, right?"
"2825980","2827940"," And we fail to get back above it."
"2828940","2832800"," I want you to, I'm going to tell you what that number is. "
"2832800","2834200"," This is on SPX right now."
"2834420","2843580"," So it is 4369.84. So 439,"
"2844480","2853460"," 4369.84. If you see not just the break, remember that, not just the break, but the rejection of"
"2853460","2854180"," that level."
"2854780","2855740"," You want to see that rejection. "
"2856740","2857660"," Do you see that rejection?"
"2858120","2858500"," Watch out."
"2859480","2861240"," Where does this put us if we do reject?"
"2861240","2868250"," It puts us all the way down to Monday at one."
"2869070","2876690"," This is, I believe, Monday, this is Monday the 9th at 11.30 in the morning to about one o "
"2876690","2877710","'clock in the afternoon. "
"2878370","2881190"," So we would free fall right down here."
"2881290","2883250"," This would be range bound trading, right?"
"2883710","2888090"," If we break that gamma flip, you start to start to see this kind of stuff in here."
"2892200","2894760"," As a matter of fact, I'm looking even lower. "
"2895420","2902520"," And we could possibly retest this low from that 418, 421 back here."
"2902640","2904840"," That was, I think this was Thursday of last week."
"2905600","2909180"," Now this was Tuesday of the 23rd and this is Friday. "
"2910060","2913200"," So a couple of key places to be aware of here."
"2913960","2917120"," And we're going to look at that right now on Webull."
"2918220","2921180"," Let's look at Webull if we begin to begin to sell here. "
"2921180","2923080"," If we begin to sell."
"2923780","2925560"," Let me see if I can get that off."
"2929020","2932160"," Let's try to find some correlation to the gamma in the marketplace. "
"2932840","2937280"," So this first, this first speed bump in the road is 4302."
"2946470","2949350"," 4302 and that correlates to spy."
"2951270","2955590"," Down at 42841. "
"2957350","2958430"," 42841 down here."
"2958650","2962390"," So if we begin to break below this, there is a possibility."
"2963510","2965810"," We know we have the one speed bump of the daily trigger. "
"2966350","2968770"," We know we have another speed bump of the weekly trigger."
"2969030","2974370"," And then we have the by the dip down here, gamma wise at 428."
"2974950","2980270"," The scary part is that if we go all the way back and retest the original low. "
"2982410","2988810"," That is way down here in this purple line that I originally bought way down here."
"2988990","2992990"," This is 4242666."
"2993810","2995750"," So on the downside target. "
"2996530","2998230"," This is like uber bearish."
"3002940","3006120"," We'll make that by the fucking dip down here."
"3006260","3010000"," You got by the fucking dip by the dip right right here. "
"3010880","3013380"," So if you do see weakness on this."
"3013960","3017060"," If you do see weakness this morning or over the weekend."
"3019400","3023320"," You know a few things make the crayon draw this shit. "
"3023900","3027860"," If you break down and reject remember that key point reject."
"3028320","3031040"," Your first target is going to be 43413."
"3031360","3035500"," If you can break below that and begin to reject that at any point. "
"3035860","3038280"," Or even if we squeeze up and bounce back down."
"3039080","3044940"," Turn the hourly trigger on its on its head and hourly trigger breaks below the daily trigger."
"3045100","3051880"," We'll then target this 430 level and this by the dip level down here. "
"3052600","3054240"," We begin to reject that."
"3054460","3060120"," Your next target below is going to be that 421."
"3061340","3061980"," 42421. "
"3062760","3063920"," 420 down here."
"3063920","3065680"," So if you're a seller or a bear."
"3066160","3068780"," And you're like hey we're going to have a crash or we're going to I don't know. "
"3069120","3073080"," Go back and retest that low any of that kind of stuff on spy specifically."
"3073920","3077420"," You want to see a break of 435 93 with a rejection."
"3077920","3082360"," Your next target is 430 under under 434. "
"3083600","3086240"," Your next target is going to be 428."
"3087200","3089940"," And then your next target is going to be 422."
"3091580","3093700"," Maybe even as low as 420. "
"3094420","3098100"," So for you bears out there for you sellers for you panic people."
"3098540","3099900"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"3100960","3104240"," That's your these are your targets in the way to the downside. "
"3104460","3106180"," But as of right now."
"3106740","3110180"," Bulls are in control whether you know it or not."
"3110720","3114900"," This is the opportunity for bulls to buy this dip here. "
"3115620","3117640"," Whether you know it or not I assure you."
"3117640","3120400"," That the bulls are in charge and the bulls."
"3121440","3125060"," As long as they keep buying this and as long as demand stays here. "
"3126100","3130500"," The the move is still to trade this upside here."
"3131360","3131920"," Okay."
"3132720","3134160"," So bulls are still in charge. "
"3134360","3137200"," You think you think as a seller you're in charge right now you are not."
"3137960","3140940"," Bulls are most assert certainly in charge."
"3141460","3147220"," This is most it's certainly most certainly only an opportunity for bulls to buy a dip. "
"3147920","3150500"," Until you break below this not below this here."
"3150880","3157240"," You got nothing so start breaking below start rejecting and we'll start having that bare thesis."
"3157700","3161480"," And we'll start shorting the market down level to level from here. "
"3161540","3165540"," Now I did make a post on Twitter yesterday."
"3166940","3169500"," I did make a post at the end of the day in Twitter I said."
"3170180","3172020"," We're going to squeeze up and gap it up overnight. "
"3172020","3177160"," But I also said that fucking VIX is telling you that they're going to sell the fuck out of the"
"3177160","3177380"," open."
"3177760","3181760"," Now we sold a little bit early due to the slightly hot print this morning."
"3182420","3183700"," So they did sell slightly early. "
"3184060","3189740"," But even if we had stayed flat or gapped more on the open this morning."
"3190280","3197100"," You would have expected a sell on the open this morning regardless of what that report was."
"3197100","3199020"," If you were watching the VIX yesterday. "
"3200180","3204800"," There was a key indicator into the closed yesterday and we're going to look at that right now."
"3205040","3210340"," So hide all this crap right here."
"3212950","3217450"," We're going to go switch over to the to the Webull chart and I got I got to have to"
"3217450","3217890"," assign. "
"3219910","3227910"," Some respect here to someone that I really look up to and that is Mike Silva mentioned yesterday."
"3228670","3231790"," That if you were to watch the last four sessions."
"3233030","3237050"," We have this great by right here right nice big fat candle. "
"3237290","3243790"," You have a smaller candle right here and he was talking about the slowing of momentum to the"
"3243790","3244250"," upside."
"3244970","3246290"," You got one right here."
"3247490","3253290"," Right and then if you are one of those people like me that says the market ends at four p "
"3253290","3256350",".m. and we're not going to count what happens afterwards. "
"3257130","3259750"," You have an inside candle and it's a small candle right."
"3260510","3266610"," You got large candle, smaller candle, smaller candle and even smaller candle right here."
"3266850","3275850"," So momentum slowing for bulls and we brought this up in the stream yesterday that we were watching"
"3275850","3282730"," the VIX yesterday and the VIX was plummeting and price was not expanding to the upside. "
"3282730","3289630"," You watch VIX get murdered yesterday and yet price did not squeeze up higher until the end of the"
"3289630","3289870"," day."
"3290930","3297670"," So watching that yesterday and watching VIX get murdered into the close leaves you saying well you"
"3297670","3299450"," know we're not at 13 right now."
"3301110","3305910"," But the VIX yesterday had slammed all the way down to what it had gotten down to. "
"3306310","3314310"," Let me see if I find that exact low from yesterday it was 1569 and price was not ripping was"
"3314310","3314510"," it."
"3314770","3317030"," It didn't go to all time highs any of that kind of stuff."
"3317630","3323430"," So we did see yesterday into the close yesterday and we bring this stuff back up here. "
"3325550","3333710"," We did see yesterday into the close VIX ripping to the downside, price not ripping to the upside."
"3334250","3341230"," Someone also brought up in the chat yesterday hey why is HYG getting lower and spy is not showing"
"3341230","3345170"," there's a divergence in HYG and spy yesterday as well."
"3345430","3353850"," So not too unexpected to see this action into this open this morning. "
"3353850","3362570"," Not not too not too unexpected is it and not too unexpected to expect this dip to hold for right"
"3362570","3365250"," now to find out if there's demand here."
"3365570","3371190"," If the bulls are going to buy this and try to have some continuation to the upside."
"3371230","3374870"," So until we break through this hourly trigger in reject. "
"3376190","3379650"," Bulls have their chance to buy the dip if they fail to buy the dip here."
"3380410","3387050"," We'll start to reverse our thesis to some kind of bear thesis some kind of sell the market thesis"
"3387050","3389330"," and turn into bears."
"3390810","3396510"," What is also fascinating about this morning too is we discussed spread yesterday and we were"
"3396510","3397910"," discussing spread yesterday. "
"3398470","3404630"," We pointed out that the one of the most beautiful parts about a spread is that if you're bullish in"
"3404630","3409630"," your thesis that you don't care where price goes as long as it gets to where you want it to"
"3409630","3409630"," be."
"3409630","3413230"," It's a go by the end of the expiration date of that call spread."
"3413610","3419550"," So hopefully you guys bought call spreads yesterday and did not just buy fucking calls right like"
"3419550","3424030"," you know like weeklies or monthlies or any of that kind of stuff. "
"3431140","3435820"," What do you got here breaking a US ass guitar to not release six billion to Iran."
"3435820","3443120"," Yeah I think there's a if I had to guess."
"3444000","3449660"," If I had to get like not guess but like kind of kind of like. "
"3450760","3454920"," I kind of bet there's a bunch of negotiations going on between."
"3457160","3460460"," The US right the the world police."
"3461460","3470080"," Whether that works or not I don't know but the world police United States trying to trying to get"
"3470080","3470980"," some kind of. "
"3473260","3482120"," Back back room agreements between guitar Saudi Arabia, Israel in the United States."
"3482880","3486260"," I think that's no whether that works or not I don't know."
"3486580","3491880"," I don't have a crystal ball I don't know enough about mitties politics but that's a that's a good"
"3491880","3494460"," insight Mr talking like you want to pay attention to that. "
"3495840","3499740"," As that as that information rolls out in the coming days and a week."
"3500260","3506780"," I think that will be material to our stock market right we drag in Qatar."
"3507620","3511780"," Do we drag in Saudi Arabia do we drag in Lebanon or do we not. "
"3511780","3518900"," Or does this I shouldn't say we but does Israel because if we if we drag those nations into war."
"3519480","3524640"," That involves the United States right that's when it does become material to our stock market."
"3524940","3530500"," If we get dragged into something more than monitoring with these two carrier strike groups. "
"3531820","3539240"," If we transition into into being pulled into this war between Hamas and Israel."
"3539240","3541920"," That would be material to our stock market."
"3546080","3549840"," Hold on a second let me see what you guys are we you guys are talking about right now. "
"3551100","3553280"," All right so done with the ranch right."
"3556520","3557820"," Here's my problem here."
"3558300","3561940"," I have some meetings this morning that I have to get and take. "
"3562520","3567920"," I don't have a choice here so I'm going to leave you guys on your own this morning."
"3569740","3573520"," With the stream I have to take it's probably going to be got I'll be here in the office."
"3573520","3574980"," I'll be here monitoring everything. "
"3575780","3579500"," But I have to take three important meetings this morning."
"3580360","3581680"," So I'll be here with you."
"3582280","3583500"," If you are a bull. "
"3584340","3587720"," This is your place to put risk on in the market."
"3588020","3590920"," You look I want to I'm going to express this to you."
"3591020","3592560"," It's very important to say this to you. "
"3594560","3597680"," We what happens a lot now this might fail here."
"3597720","3599920"," It doesn't it doesn't matter if it fails here."
"3600420","3602060"," But I got to talk to you about this. "
"3604760","3606760"," So there's this is how things go."
"3608840","3611620"," If you're a bull I'm going to show you exactly what happens here."
"3611700","3614100"," Let me go up and show up a screen okay. "
"3615380","3617480"," I'm going to show you exactly what happens to the bull okay."
"3618600","3619740"," Support is here."
"3624000","3625660"," Right price comes down. "
"3629630","3630850"," Bounces on support."
"3631890","3633270"," And you get scared."
"3634790","3636230"," So you don't buy the debt. "
"3637710","3642230"," And what we're in it we're what we do for work what we do is risk."
"3643010","3647810"," We do risk we put risk on and we have risk of losing all of our money."
"3648410","3649090"," That's what happens. "
"3649930","3651750"," We risk losing all of our money."
"3652350","3652910"," Right."
"3653730","3655870"," Now you as a bull or a buyer. "
"3656670","3657670"," We come down to support."
"3658410","3660250"," And you go off fuck no I buy that."
"3660750","3663470"," What if we break below and start to reject to the downside. "
"3666300","3667100"," What in fact."
"3668160","3672460"," You should be putting that risk on if if you catch a bounce here if you catch a bounce."
"3676440","3678660"," You should be putting risk on in here. "
"3680280","3681160"," With stops below."
"3688520","3691660"," But what in reality what happens is you catch the bounce here."
"3693260","3693740"," Right. "
"3693960","3695560"," And you don't put that risk on."
"3696140","3697400"," We start going up."
"3697560","3698380"," We start going up. "
"3698540","3699380"," We start going up."
"3700420","3701580"," And you go fuck man."
"3701720","3702740"," That looks bullish now. "
"3704060","3706160"," And you go fucking I'm buying calls."
"3706560","3708420"," So you actually buy your calls right here."
"3710910","3712770"," And then it rolls over on you. "
"3713370","3715230"," And you come into my stream and you go."
"3716050","3718490"," What happened cap I'm getting torched here."
"3718490","3722230"," And I go what about down here did you buy the dip down here. "
"3722430","3725390"," And you go now fuck no I wanted to see it get bullish first."
"3726550","3728310"," It's a very common thing."
"3729090","3733690"," That traders do is they don't buy this dip down here they wait to see it go up. "
"3733870","3736250"," And they they they enter at the wrong time right."
"3737550","3739630"," So they're not putting risk on in the marketplace."
"3741690","3743730"," Now does that mean you buy. "
"3744670","3747870"," Every time we roll into one of these support levels."
"3749510","3750710"," The answer is no."
"3751510","3752530"," You do not buy that. "
"3752910","3754310"," But you do not buy this either."
"3754830","3758170"," So you're not buying this you're not buying that where do you buy."
"3759210","3762130"," And that's where this stream comes into play for you. "
"3762850","3765530"," This is how you have an edge on the market."
"3766430","3770010"," These are the tools they try to give you day in day out."
"3770010","3774050"," And that is number one that you know where the support is. "
"3777220","3780460"," Right and most people don't know where the support is."
"3780820","3784120"," Well you do you know the hourly trigger is right there."
"3784780","3789160"," And then you're looking for a turn in the one and five minute triggers. "
"3789960","3793260"," To enter that long down here."
"3794000","3795860"," Not up there."
"3797040","3799880"," So let's look one more time we're going to look really quick. "
"3801480","3803160"," Back on this we will chart."
"3804560","3807040"," And you know what you're looking for."
"3807320","3812320"," You know that you're looking for a cross to the you're looking for the bounce on the early trigger. "
"3813200","3817620"," And you're looking for the cross the bullish cross."
"3819360","3822080"," To begin so that you can begin to get long."
"3822640","3823900"," So as price comes down. "
"3827460","3828820"," As price is blasting."
"3829200","3831140"," Let me see if I can do this on one here."
"3837480","3839480"," Price is blasting down right. "
"3840580","3842600"," And you're waiting for a bounce."
"3842840","3844340"," You're not buying that right."
"3844500","3846580"," You want to see a bounce right. "
"3847060","3850760"," You've already got the you've already got the changes color here."
"3851200","3852640"," I think a little bit redder."
"3853560","3855000"," You've already got the cross. "
"3858240","3860080"," Of the one and five minute triggers."
"3861800","3862980"," Down here right."
"3863840","3866720"," You're not buying that you're not buying that early trigger. "
"3867340","3869920"," Right but you're not waiting to work here either."
"3870760","3876960"," But you are looking for what what happens what's the what's the what's the what's the price action"
"3876960","3877220"," right."
"3877500","3878760"," Everybody calls it price action right. "
"3879240","3880460"," So you're looking for."
"3881480","3883200"," The bounce first."
"3888700","3892600"," Right you're looking for the pullback down right here is overly simplified. "
"3895700","3899000"," But then you're kind of looking for that cross right there right."
"3899820","3903940"," You're looking for that five minute EMA to slip underneath."
"3905480","3909740"," And you're looking for price to begin to show you the way higher. "
"3911420","3915340"," That when you're confirming that cross there this cross right here."
"3916100","3918240"," And you're on the hourly trigger right here."
"3919060","3924260"," You can then with some confidence begin to get long on that hourly trigger. "
"3924740","3925880"," So it's not a function of."
"3926100","3929000"," Hey I'm going to buy this hourly trigger why did it keep blasting through."
"3929640","3931560"," It's not a question of it blasting through. "
"3931700","3932720"," It's not a question of the bounce."
"3933160","3934440"," You already know where the bounce is."
"3935040","3938840"," You're looking for the bounce and then the reversal on the one and five minute trigger. "
"3939380","3940740"," To begin to get long again."
"3941340","3943020"," You don't get long until this happens."
"3943860","3947540"," If we start to break down you're you're not you're all the better right. "
"3948400","3949440"," You're like sitting."
"3951280","3952400"," Jesus looks terrible."
"3952740","3955000"," I'm like looking at some of this some of these drawings I have here. "
"3955040","3956000"," It looks like dog shit."
"3960000","3961780"," And you're waiting for that cross."
"3962160","3965580"," So we're on the hourly trigger right now right watch this hourly trigger. "
"3966260","3967380"," We're bouncing on the early trigger."
"3967780","3970280"," We don't have the cross yet but we almost do don't we look at this."
"3970560","3973080"," This white and red line right here look at this right here. "
"3973780","3976500"," You get the red line the white line the cross has not happened yet."
"3977060","3979860"," You're watching and what else do we talk about this stream is."
"3980760","3982360"," When they do buy this. "
"3983020","3986360"," You only need to go to that previous high."
"3987120","3992460"," If they can get up to that previous high and we already know the half hour triggers here and we"
"3992460","3992900"," reject."
"3993440","3995080"," You're then looking for. "
"3996200","3998260"," If you're a bully's you're looking for."
"4001600","4002800"," The squeeze."
"4003780","4008080"," The pullback and the confirmation off of the white line right here. "
"4011000","4012740"," So let's look at this real quick."
"4014160","4015660"," Before I get into this meeting."
"4016700","4018780"," So you're looking for something like. "
"4021200","4022260"," The bounce."
"4023120","4023760"," Right."
"4024600","4027240"," Come back to that previous shit hold on a second here. "
"4031370","4033870"," You're looking for the excuse me."
"4039600","4041660"," You're looking for the bounce right."
"4042240","4044420"," You're looking for at least right here. "
"4044420","4047400"," Like right over there whether it goes higher or not."
"4047560","4047980"," I don't care."
"4048460","4050620"," I don't want to see the green come up here. "
"4050840","4054080"," Immediately reverse right because that's showing you."
"4054520","4057980"," The failure of buyers right buyers with no will right."
"4058380","4060900"," But if you see the buyers come in and push this up. "
"4061260","4064380"," Push this up here anywhere above over here."
"4065920","4068360"," Anywhere right you're going to expect a pullback."
"4069200","4072440"," To confirm and then the other leg higher. "
"4072440","4075900"," And you can begin to enter these trades here."
"4076260","4078720"," Or even above this half hour trigger."
"4078900","4080700"," It's why we keep this half hour trigger right. "
"4081320","4084000"," So if you see this reversal begin to take place."
"4085000","4087620"," You're going to then get start to get fucking long."
"4088980","4092420"," You're going to get long off of that price action. "
"4093100","4094760"," And you're going to put a stop."
"4096040","4097800"," Underneath the hourly trigger."
"4098380","4099960"," This is your edge. "
"4099960","4102340"," You have an edge over other people."
"4102340","4103899"," Other market participants."
"4105000","4106779"," So you put your stops down here. "
"4109939","4111700"," And you're waiting for this confirmation."
"4112420","4113700"," You want to see this action."
"4114300","4116140"," You don't want to be fucking waiting. "
"4125130","4126689"," You don't want to be waiting."
"4130380","4133960"," For all of this action and this push up into this over here."
"4134060","4135640"," And then you're like fucking buying calls right here. "
"4135899","4137540"," You get what I'm saying."
"4137859","4139580"," You have your buying calls right here."
"4140359","4142279"," Like no, no, no, it was way back here. "
"4143340","4148899"," You're using your tools to know that the direction is up or the direction is down."
"4153260","4155460"," And right now what is it looking like to you?"
"4155620","4157180"," What does that action look like to you?"
"4157760","4160760"," Sure as shit right now looks like buyers are here."
"4161819","4162680"," To me it does. "
"4163380","4165840"," It looks like an opportunity to buy the dip right now."
"4166260","4168680"," And until we break and reject off that hourly trigger."
"4169520","4170899"," You buy that fucking dip. "
"4170899","4173319"," That is where you make your fucking money."
"4174120","4175979"," This is where you have your edge."
"4176160","4179120"," This is where if it pulls back you're still up. "
"4179700","4181819"," When I bought that to that for 18."
"4182760","4184319"," I had no sweat."
"4185140","4187340"," As the days progressed and we pulled back. "
"4188100","4192220"," We went to I think this was on Monday or Tuesday morning in the pre market."
"4192520","4194680"," We went back and recheck that for 18."
"4194980","4196080"," It was a four eighteen for 19. "
"4196680","4197960"," We rechecked it and immediately bounced."
"4197960","4199740"," And I was like, yeah, we're still good."
"4199740","4202720"," We're still fucking good on that four eighteen for 19. "
"4203160","4207160"," I know the buyers or I knew the buyers were there and I was assuming they were still there."
"4207340","4209900"," I didn't change my stance of becoming bearish."
"4210840","4215360"," I believe it was Tuesday morning in the pre market and I was like, as long as you don't break"
"4215360","4218480"," below that and start rejecting that number, I'm good. "
"4219180","4220500"," I'm going to keep holding here."
"4220700","4221780"," I'm still bullish here."
"4222360","4226400"," And this is your chance to be bullish is on this hourly trigger. "
"4227000","4228400"," This is your dip buying opportunity."
"4228400","4229540"," I know it's scary."
"4229840","4232380"," I know that you're like, oh my God, I don't want to do this or. "
"4232820","4233680"," Oh, I'm so scared."
"4233820","4238580"," Everybody's telling me this dog shit on Twitter and this dog shit in Bloomberg and this dog shit"
"4238580","4244620"," with fucking the inverted yield curve and this dog shit with all this other diarrhea that you read"
"4244620","4245120"," out there."
"4246240","4247980"," That doesn't fucking matter. "
"4249160","4250040"," Price matters."
"4251360","4252940"," Price always matters."
"4253720","4257060"," So if you see that set up starting, you enter. "
"4257420","4259680"," If it begins to go against you, you exit."
"4260320","4262920"," We begin to sell off the hourly trigger."
"4263540","4264480"," Sure, you cut your losses. "
"4264780","4266900"," You switch to a seller of the market."
"4267200","4272540"," But until that happens, this is your time and your place and you don't automatically buy that"
"4272540","4273020"," hourly trigger."
"4273160","4276480"," You wait for it to begin to consolidate and move higher. "
"4287620","4289260"," And that's how you fucking lose and win."
"4289480","4290080"," I'm telling you."
"4290080","4291800"," That is how you fucking lose. "
"4292160","4293980"," That is how you fucking win this market."
"4295220","4300200"," All the garbage that you hear out there, it's fucking meaningless."
"4300840","4301820"," It's fucking meaningless. "
"4302620","4305000"," It sucks to say it, but it is."
"4306520","4312180"," And the excuse that you get is bad news is now good news."
"4312900","4317940"," The other excuse that you get is a moving the ball, right?"
"4319020","4322640"," Everybody focusing on this, this, this, this, this, this. "
"4322640","4328820"," And they switch the conversation because price didn't go where that argument went, right?"
"4329000","4330280"," Whether it's up or down, it doesn't matter."
"4331600","4334540"," You hear the shift of conversation."
"4335800","4336920"," So here's an example. "
"4337520","4343960"," If this morning we hold this hourly trigger and we had higher, if we had higher, every fucking"
"4343960","4347100"," story you read this morning is garbage."
"4348380","4355120"," If we go up from here, you'll hear the story change in the shit that you consume."
"4357460","4359600"," And it's like, it's like, oh, it's all over. "
"4360180","4361080"," Forget we said all that."
"4361280","4363240"," Now, now listen to this that we're saying to you."
"4364400","4369280"," You know, in some of you get, get, get caught in that rightfully so, right?"
"4369460","4370900"," You get caught and you go, wait a minute, wait a minute. "
"4371200","4373780"," I'm short as fuck or I'm long as fuck."
"4375040","4378660"," What happened to that conversation we were just having that we're going to all-time highs?"
"4379320","4382060"," What happened to that conversation we're having of a crash coming?"
"4382880","4385060"," I'm still short or I'm still long."
"4385500","4389780"," Can we come back to that conversation and people are like, fuck you ain't going back to that"
"4389780","4390120"," conversation. "
"4390120","4390860"," It didn't work."
"4391380","4394200"," We're gonna, we're gonna tell you some more bullshit on social media."
"4395100","4397060"," Price is now going up, bro, come on over here. "
"4398420","4400720"," So, you know, price action is king."
"4400720","4403860"," And you have your tools."
"4404140","4405620"," You know where your hourly trigger is. "
"4405700","4406960"," You know where your daily trigger is."
"4407240","4410200"," You know the direction of those triggers matter."
"4410760","4413720"," If the hourly trigger is vertical to the downside, you're bearish. "
"4414500","4416920"," The hourly trigger is going sideways, you're neutral."
"4417640","4419740"," Hourly trigger is going up, you're bullish, right?"
"4421220","4422380"," Daily trigger, same shit."
"4429520","4430360"," Thin twits my bang. "
"4431780","4433360"," I love thin twits too."
"4433480","4434260"," I gotta be honest here."
"4434260","4436980"," I can't tell you that I don't love thin twits. "
"4437160","4437480"," I do."
"4438600","4443140"," But some of y'all out there drink that shit like it's real and it's just not."
"4443920","4445620"," It's meant to sell you subscriptions. "
"4446760","4448300"," It's meant to get traction."
"4449300","4449820"," It's meant."
"4450020","4450520"," I get paid. "
"4450700","4452200"," I get a fucking paycheck from Twitter."
"4452980","4460480"," The more garbage that I post, the more garbage that I post on Twitter, I get a fatter check than"
"4460480","4462780"," the real shit that you should post on Twitter."
"4462780","4470000"," Twitter has become a place where if I can get you to interact with my tweets or get angry at"
"4470000","4475300"," my tweets or fight with each other in the comment section, that's where I make money. "
"4476020","4482240"," I do not make any money by not telling you the truth or by telling you the truth."
"4482880","4483840"," You don't want to hear the truth."
"4484080","4489780"," You want to fight with each other, you want to argue, you want to get emotional, you want to,"
"4490020","4491380"," especially if it's not your thesis. "
"4492180","4496380"," All that stuff gets traction and I actually get a paycheck if I do that to you."
"4496480","4497020"," I don't do it."
"4497700","4501320"," I make jokes about wanting to do it, but that's what it's turned into. "
"4501600","4504040"," And most of media is like that today."
"4504720","4510820"," Twitter is only one example of where all of our media has come to."
"4511520","4515000"," I read an article that I didn't fully agree with on the New Yorker. "
"4515000","4519980"," I think it was the New Yorker, New York Times about how it was titled something about the Internet"
"4519980","4521000"," is no longer fun."
"4521760","4526280"," I'm not really a fan of the New Yorker, but they had some good points."
"4527480","4537340"," And that is that the shit that you and I are consuming today is 1000% built upon engagement. "
"4538420","4544980"," There used to be some kind of semblance in mass media."
"4545000","4548140"," Of a duty to inform you."
"4548580","4555580"," And over the years that has eroded, you saw a movie called the network in the 1970s, I think 70s"
"4555580","4560300"," that discussed this paradigm shift in media. "
"4561260","4571260"," And now that media is on the Internet with no regulation in the United States, at least the entire"
"4571260","4577260"," fucking everything that you're consuming is built upon only engagement."
"4578360","4581880"," It's all built upon fucking with your emotions."
"4582780","4583580"," It's what it's built on. "
"4583620","4587420"," It has nothing, no basis in reality, no basis in truth."
"4588780","4589980"," Because you wouldn't like that."
"4590080","4591040"," It doesn't keep you engaged. "
"4591780","4593000"," It doesn't keep you in my garden."
"4594220","4601880"," So be aware of that shit as you be aware of that shit as you're as you're forming your opinions"
"4601880","4603960"," on where this market is going up or down."
"4604120","4606240"," I don't care if it's up on it's down. "
"4607200","4608580"," It's just like not real."
"4608600","4609100"," It's fake."
"4609960","4617020"," So enjoy it for what it is, but but price action is king in this market and in this day"
"4617020","4619620"," and age of what you're consuming out there. "
"4621800","4623220"," I mean, actually, I mean x."
"4623600","4626660"," Are you guys, are you all you Elon bros out there?"
"4626760","4627200"," You guys are."
"4627620","4633360"," Oh, you Elon bros out there defending the X."
"4634460","4635760"," I looked up X yesterday."
"4635980","4637040"," A bunch of porn came back. "
"4637600","4638980"," I did a big search yesterday first."
"4639180","4641560"," I was looking for X videos and somehow porn came up."
"4645240","4648400"," It's not just division. "
"4648920","4649380"," It's money."
"4649380","4651380"," It's like money and power."
"4652420","4655780"," Like they love the division, but they also love that money and power. "
"4657480","4660500"," So let's see if we can break above the hourly trigger the half hour trigger."
"4660640","4661460"," This is an important one."
"4662740","4664780"," I would like to see that break above. "
"4669690","4672390"," I would love to see that break right here."
"4674150","4675750"," And take that trade right there."
"4676730","4679330"," I would love to see that break right now. "
"4679330","4682370"," We're not we're not we're still not above yet still watching it."
"4683130","4684610"," I want to see that break dude."
"4684690","4686390"," I want to see if I see that break up there. "
"4687950","4689650"," Tag that bad boy right there."
"4690070","4692170"," Come back down and then rocket ship up."
"4695170","4697090"," Okay, so I'll be back with you here in a little bit. "
"4700570","4702810"," Got some close friends call me this morning paranoid."
"4702810","4704350"," I'm like, it's okay."
"4704430","4705010"," I got your brother. "
"4705010","4705610"," I love you."
"4706150","4707150"," Just hold on man."
"4709750","4710870"," Let's see what happens. "
"4710870","4712590"," Let's see if we get a big squeeze out of the snuff."
"4712730","4715850"," We reject this or if we start to break above that half power trigger."
"4719360","4721480"," Yeah, we got all that shit going on too, right?"
"4721640","4724200"," Bear Town Sheriff's like spending time the correct people. "
"4724360","4726660"," That used to be in good good taste too, right?"
"4727120","4729600"," Remember like back in the day on social media, go on Reddit."
"4730740","4734200"," And someone would come in and nicely be like, you misspelled this."
"4734980","4736740"," And now it's like militancy, right?"
"4737580","4739560"," Like fucking let's cause a fight on the Internet. "
"4739840","4740600"," That guy was wrong."
"4740860","4741640"," You mean miss the letter."
"4742640","4743160"," Let's go. "
"4743280","4744900"," Let's go after him and burn him to the ground."
"4747880","4751100"," It used to be like, it used to be like a positive experience, right?"
"4751280","4752280"," Hey man, let me help you out here."
"4753460","4755320"," You used your and not your. "
"4757260","4759400"," You didn't put an apostrophe in your bro."
"4759880","4761420"," You just spelt it why you are."
"4766100","4767260"," Let's stocks his ass. "
"4769920","4770700"," So true."
"4773880","4776200"," Can't even have a differing of opinion anymore, right?"
"4779960","4781440"," That we don't know."
"4781500","4783040"," We're noticing that right now too, right?"
"4783400","4784660"," It's like, you know, it's funny. "
"4784820","4785700"," It's not funny."
"4786500","4787460"," I shouldn't say it's funny, but."
"4788440","4793780"," You're watching it though, unfold with a Palestine or Hamas in Israel, right?"
"4794660","4798080"," Everyone's out there trying to be like, look at those guys over there. "
"4798080","4800440"," You know, look at these guys over there."
"4800600","4804620"," Look at those Republicans that they weren't supporting the Ukraine and now they're supporting"
"4804620","4805040"," Israel."
"4805680","4807520"," And look at those liberals over there. "
"4807680","4810120"," They can't square away that Palestine's bad, right?"
"4810360","4817340"," There can't be a conversation amongst people that has a gray area, right?"
"4817440","4818380"," There's no gray anymore."
"4818680","4821200"," It's like, it's like, ha ha, we surprised you."
"4821360","4824000"," Ha ha, we fucked you and we fucked the Republicans. "
"4824220","4826100"," We fucked the Democrats and all of the stupid shit."
"4826100","4830860"," It's like you can't have a gray opinion on everything."
"4830860","4836400"," You can't have something that's issue to issue or even acknowledge, hey, you can't take sides"
"4836400","4837380"," specifically in this. "
"4837380","4840080"," This is like the one good one here with not."
"4840100","4844380"," It's not good, but this is the one good one where it's so."
"4845600","4848560"," It's so nuanced that you can take. "
"4848800","4855740"," You can take either side back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"4856380","4857580"," That's Hamas that sucks."
"4857860","4860040"," So it's just the militants and not the civilians. "
"4860040","4863760"," Or maybe it's just civilians that have been radicalized yet in the strip, right?"
"4864240","4867500"," So there's like all these like, what about this example over here?"
"4867640","4869280"," What about cutting off baby's heads?"
"4869820","4870440"," You know, that's horrible."
"4870660","4871440"," That kind of stuff, right?"
"4872420","4873000"," And you can't."
"4873100","4874040"," There's none of that anymore. "
"4884220","4887720"," It's so, it's so, it's so, it's so horrible to see, but it's what it is."
"4887720","4892740"," So just don't go down too much of that rabbit hole."
"4892960","4893540"," Don't go down. "
"4893840","4895780"," Don't drink too much of that Kool-Aid, right?"
"4897000","4897680"," Is the point."
"4899740","4900100"," Okay."
"4900280","4900520"," Here we go. "
"4900700","4901300"," Still grinding higher."
"4901500","4903640"," I'll be back with you guys in the next hour or so."
"4903640","4907400"," I know I hope I show you back by one o'clock, two o'clock, something like that. "
"4908200","4909240"," So situation normal."
"4909240","4911900"," So far we haven't rejected the half-fire triggers yet."
"4912660","4913960"," I'm looking for that squeeze higher. "
"4915240","4916240"," There's another target up here."
"4916400","4918060"," Let me see if I can put our one up here for you."
"4919120","4919520"," 437. "
"4919960","4920260"," 52."
"4925580","4925980"," 437."
"4930960","4931700"," Right there. "
"4932460","4936200"," Let's make that white and four points, I guess."
"4939480","4941400"," This is R1 right here."
"4941640","4942840"," I want to show you this really quick. "
"4943040","4945700"," So right here is R1 right there."
"4946860","4948620"," So we'll change this a little bit."
"4948860","4951340"," We'll bring this up right there. "
"4954140","4957440"," And then we'll look for the second one right about there."
"4957980","4960340"," It's right there."
"4960440","4963460"," See it, the first one right here and the second one right there. "
"4964300","4965140"," So you can see it."
"4966560","4970920"," Now, R2 is, you know, this is the, you want to hear the gross part of this?"
"4972300","4972860"," 43875."
"4974920","4981140"," One of the gross parts of what I'm talking about with you is it shows. "
"4987960","4997920"," So there is, it shows the market going up in the face of what's going on right now shows that"
"4997920","4999060"," the market was positioned."
"5000540","5001800"," Two go up."
"5002120","5003840"," It lifts the skirt of banks. "
"5006760","5008940"," So right there is R1."
"5009860","5011380"," I'll move this over."
"5012160","5015640"," Move that over there so that it's not in your way today. "
"5017100","5018160"," There's R2."
"5019180","5020180"," There's R1."
"5029370","5032470"," And unless you get a break, so your stops are right here. "
"5041250","5045310"," And you're also looking for rejection to the downside here as well."
"5047590","5050470"," You're looking for that kind of action to go to the downside."

"10199080","10199720"," Put it back up here. "
"10202360","10203320"," Holy fuck."
"10208100","10210680"," Let's make that small right there."
"10213780","10215280"," There's a hidden level down there. "
"10215420","10216440"," Hide and still even lower."
"10217020","10218140"," You can see it down here."
"10221180","10223160"," There's a hidden level down here somewhere. "
"10223380","10223940"," Let me look for it."
"10224040","10224760"," No, it's right there."
"10225860","10227120"," There's one right here. "
"10227960","10228940"," Way down here."
"10228940","10230280"," There's one that disappeared."
"10230600","10234040"," Now it hasn't popped back up yet, but it's still down there. "
"10237740","10239800"," You should expect more downside here."
"10240120","10241060"," Hold on a second here."
"10245580","10248700"," God, I'm so fucking happy that I'm not in any trade right now. "
"10251000","10252020"," Hold on a second here."
"10252740","10256160"," Hold on."
"10256300","10257120"," Move all this stuff down. "
"10257300","10257860"," Give me one quick second."
"10258000","10260220"," I'm going to switch over to the Weebold chart here."
"10260780","10262040"," So just be aware. "
"10262380","10263900"," A couple of things you'll be aware of here."
"10264260","10264800"," Number one."
"10267960","10272160"," The vertical white at one minute, five minute trigger still vertical right now. "
"10272160","10276860"," If you were to want to buy a dip here, there is no dip for you to buy."
"10278080","10279640"," We're going down right now."
"10279760","10285480"," So if you want to have a dip to buy, you have to first see a reversal here. "
"10286440","10287740"," Flattening of this five minute."
"10288640","10295400"," And then a flattening of the white line and then price to reverse first."
"10295400","10301580"," So if you're a bull out there and you're looking for a dip to buy, you need to see some"
"10301580","10304300"," kind of action like that to take a dip buy. "
"10304840","10307320"," So unless you see something like that, move is to the downside."
"10307880","10312760"," And you've also got some support levels down here."
"10312760","10313420"," They're kind of tight. "
"10314740","10317320"," But I would expect us to tag those right now."
"10317380","10320540"," I can't hear this."
"10321040","10322760"," We'll be further east if necessary. "
"10323900","10327220"," I'm going to turn that up so I can hear it."
"10328040","10332580"," So even if you catch the bounce right here, like right here at the 4.3274, do not trust it."
"10333360","10335800"," You're going to be looking for this to tee off to go to the downside. "
"10336320","10342220"," So right now you're looking for more downside like this, more downside off the, off the daily"
"10342220","10342500"," trigger."
"10342500","10348160"," Even if it consolidates, even if it comes up and retests right here, you can get boxed into a"
"10348160","10351760"," consolidation zone and then more downside to come into that close."
"10352380","10357220"," So unless you get a reversal, unless if you're a bull, unless you get a reversal here. "
"10358680","10363270"," Of price to reverse."
"10363510","10363970"," Wait a minute."
"10364030","10364490"," It's all wrong. "
"10365670","10369190"," Back one and then turn that up right there."
"10369990","10374630"," Unless you begin to see price come up here and start to reverse and get above that daily trigger."
"10375270","10377570"," It's going to be used as a springboard to the downside. "
"10378130","10381230"," So even this bottoming that you see right here, don't trust this as a bull."
"10381790","10387030"," And if you're trying to get in on the selling action, you want to be looking at right here, just"
"10387030","10391470"," selling this daily trigger at 4.34.08 to the downside."
"10392630","10393850"," So no trade here yet for bulls. "
"10394610","10399330"," And I want you to see two, two places down below here that we highlighted this morning."
"10399430","10405890"," The first one was that by the dip down here at 4.28. And then there's one even lower at"
"10405890","10408490"," 4.21 or 22."
"10408870","10414430"," So there's more downside that can come out of this rather than upside. "
"10415070","10417750"," Look for that down there and even this down here."
"10418130","10420010"," This might not be today or anything like that."
"10420010","10422010"," You might not see that for 20 today. "
"10422730","10428090"," But we did review this morning that if you start to break down below that hourly trigger, what your"
"10428090","10429130"," targets are to the downside."
"10429670","10436170"," So easily, weekly trigger could easily be had by the end of today or into this close today."
"10436610","10440010"," Don't get caught in this, trying to buy a dip down here. "
"10440290","10446590"," And if you're a seller, you're looking to now sell 4.34, 4.34, 13."
"10447330","10451370"," And possibly even just this one minute trigger here."
"10451370","10453350"," So we'll see how this plays out. "
"10453490","10458510"," I've got another meeting at a good one too, but this roll is fucking huge, baby."
"10459150","10461130"," Let's take a look at the 10 year really quick."
"10461810","10463190"," Let me see if I can go to the trigger screen. "
"10463370","10464390"," Let's go to the 10 year."
"10466310","10467550"," Are we on this right now?"
"10467670","10467770"," Yeah."
"10469250","10470710"," I'm going to turn this shit up. "
"10470750","10471630"," I can't hear none of this."
"10473510","10474630"," I'm going to turn that up."
"10475870","10476690"," 10 year yield. "
"10480820","10482160"," What am I on right now?"
"10501470","10504210"," Ooh, look at that turn, baby."
"10505770","10510290"," Look at that turn to the upside back in its channel right now."
"10511070","10513270"," That's the Bill Ackman Larry Fink projection. "
"10513610","10516130"," The Goldman Sachs was the sideways movement here."
"10516670","10520290"," Do you guys remember that the Goldman Sachs claiming that you're going to get some sideways"
"10520290","10521130"," movements in here?"
"10521370","10527130"," And then you've got Bill Ackman saying that the projection is that 4.95% still not there."
"10527390","10531250"," 10 year looking like it wants to climb back up and stay in its channel right now. "
"10533270","10539350"," And let's take a look at ADBE was one that I was checking yesterday for somebody."
"10540950","10542250"," Let's look at Adobe here."
"10543190","10544730"," Is this thing still on track?"
"10545750","10547950"," No, you're not even done coming down yet. "
"10548010","10549430"," Still not done coming down on Adobe."
"10550090","10551890"," Let me look at SPX."
"10554570","10557370"," Yeah, baby CJJ wants to buy this dip down here. "
"10562550","10563650"," Half hour of velocity."
"10566090","10567170"," Just getting started."
"10567530","10570070"," Our only velocity almost there is zero line right now. "
"10570270","10572150"," We could easily see more downside to come."
"10573030","10577010"," On the half hour of velocity in SPX before there's a dip to buy."
"10577330","10579030"," So be really careful here. "
"10579030","10581490"," You're watching the hourly fellow come down in SPX."
"10581850","10582750"," It's not zero line."
"10582910","10583990"," So it's kind of neutral here. "
"10584330","10585990"," It's not really bearish or bullish."
"10586330","10590330"," But if you begin to see price, start to head lower right about where we are."
"10592430","10594190"," It's at plus nine right now. "
"10594230","10596110"," So there could be more downside to come at least."
"10596110","10603470"," And then if we begin to break down and start to curve underneath, this could be implying more"
"10603470","10605170"," downside to come on SPX."
"10613660","10615440"," Did any news pop up?"
"10615540","10616220"," I wasn't paying attention. "
"10616320","10617160"," I was in some meetings."
"10619740","10620960"," Yeah, today."
"10623800","10624620"," Blasted down. "
"10624800","10625720"," I wish I was on this trade."
"10635990","10639210"," Still targeting this $429.46 at minimum."
"10639690","10641770"," Looking for a little bit of rejection off the one minute trigger. "
"10642470","10645030"," Price targets right down here."
"10645410","10647510"," So I think kind of like rejection in here."
"10648710","10649870"," Right down there. "
"10649990","10650850"," Where's 4PM?"
"10652350","10662330"," Right down there,"
"10662390","10662490"," baby."
"10662710","10664390"," There's that weekly trigger right down there."
"10665650","10666930"," That's 4PM for you. "
"10672950","10676910"," Do not be bearish."
"10676910","10678250"," I'm trying to buy any of these dips here at all."
"10683780","10685680"," Bring up this S2 and S3. "
"10686000","10688000"," And let me give you one quick second here."
"10701850","10703470"," That's two right there."
"10707830","10708830"," 430, 75. "
"10726930","10729510"," And I'll move this one over so you can."
"10731310","10732190"," That over there."
"10732290","10734470"," So you can stay focused on that. "
"10735870","10736410"," There."
"10739990","10742170"," Oh, nasty selling, baby."
"10743330","10743870"," Spoons. "
"10744830","10746790"," Losing the hourly trigger, losing the daily trigger."
"10748270","10750790"," Targets to the downside by end of day."
"10752250","10754310"," 42430 will put the target right down here. "
"10755130","10756570"," 430 as target."
"10756950","10758490"," Likely more downside to come."
"10762270","10766210"," Vicks blasting off that $15, $16 we talked about. "
"10766550","10769210"," Was there any kind of news that came out that I missed?"
"10769990","10773630"," Vicks now trading 17.03, baby."
"10774650","10777730"," Apple losing its crown now rolling down below."
"10778790","10781310"," Still green on the day, believe it or not. "
"10781310","10782290"," Apple still green."
"10783870","10785550"," But it is breaking below."
"10785590","10788150"," It's 129 EMA on a."
"10789050","10789830"," That's wrong chart. "
"10790010","10790570"," Hold on a second here."
"10794850","10796850"," Tesla bloodbath in it right now."
"10797830","10801070"," NDX still holding itself up pretty nicely here. "
"10801930","10805470"," So Nasdaq not doing so bad still back in its consolidation zone."
"10806490","10809910"," We've known demand on SPR on NDX."
"10811510","10817830"," 15119.27. 15119.27 on Nasdaq. "
"10818470","10819770"," Dixie ripping to the upside."
"10820170","10821410"," Dixie has more room to run."
"10822150","10825810"," It can easily trade 10730. "
"10826210","10827410"," 10730 on Dixie."
"10828270","10829590"," HYG with a rollover."
"10830010","10834130"," Not only do they have a rollover, but I want to bring your attention to something here. "
"10835030","10844930"," This morning we're talking about risk to the market and the next from the 11th to the 15th due"
"10844930","10849890"," to the war in Israel and Hamas."
"10850470","10857450"," I do want to bring your attention to HYG specifically has a cross on it."
"10857450","10859930"," A one hour bear cross on it. "
"10860110","10862690"," That's extremely unhealthy."
"10863210","10863790"," Very sickly."
"10864050","10872650"," So draw your attention at home to a one hour chart on HYG and the cross that's taking place on"
"10872650","10872790"," it. "
"10872990","10876430"," Very bearish right now on risk on and HYG."
"10876570","10879670"," So if you're not inputs, you should be inputs at this point."
"10879910","10882950"," If you're trying to buy a dip, do not try to buy a dip here. "
"10883170","10884770"," Let me see if I bring HYG up really quick."
"10889150","10907600"," Yeah, right"
"10907600","10907760"," here."
"10907860","10910960"," This loss right here of the monthly trigger extremely bearish. "
"10911540","10916760"," So I want to put your attention to this one right here, this monthly trigger."
"10917500","10923060"," Now we don't have a cross yet of the hourly trigger or the daily trigger crossing through the"
"10923060","10928920"," weekly trigger, but be very suspicious here with this hourly cross over the monthly can be"
"10928920","10930180"," extremely bearish."
"10930680","10935780"," So in HYG specifically, let's look at HYG on a on a classic chart here. "
"10941410","10942990"," No, that's the wrong ticker."
"10944770","10945890"," Jim, it's so excited."
"10946090","10951030"," I'm like, I'm looking at this and I'm like, man, we've got a earning season starting. "
"10952170","10954950"," And I have high hopes for earning season this year."
"10956210","10960050"," But I want you to I want to bring your attention right here."
"10961890","10964850"," And bulls need to pull this out right now. "
"10964990","10968530"," If they don't pull this out, I want you to draw your attention to this right here."
"10969010","10970430"," Yeah, we're on the right chart here."
"10971090","10976610"," I want to show you this role that's taking place right now. "
"10977210","10981310"," And it's not confirmed yet, but I want you to bring your attention to it."
"10982090","10987730"," So even if even if we squeeze even if like right now at this moment, we squeezed higher in HYG."
"10988750","10990810"," This is this does not look good here. "
"10991070","10992730"," This is this looks like bloodbath territory."
"10992810","10998970"," Now that would bring us back to that that prior low back here on spoons."
"10999050","11003550"," That's that four eighteen four eighteen four twenty down here. "
"11003730","11007210"," So this hourly cross here extremely bearish right now."
"11007210","11008010"," You don't want to see this."
"11008090","11012790"," When you see this on an hourly, it's like one to three days of down with the confirmed cross. "
"11014170","11017010"," It can lead into five days price matters more."
"11017390","11023010"," But HYG is showing you that we can easily go down here on a reversal."
"11024170","11026270"," That's that four eighteen four. "
"11026410","11029190"," That's four twenty somewhere in here today tomorrow."
"11029470","11032790"," And even into Monday and Tuesday real risk here."
"11033590","11034710"," Into the weekend. "
"11035770","11041610"," And this would be in some anticipation of the ramping of the war in."
"11043850","11044930"," In Israel."
"11045310","11046130"," So just be careful. "
"11046850","11048450"," This is not healthy, not good."
"11049010","11053830"," If bulls are able to reclaim that hourly trigger on HYG, if they have to come up here."
"11054970","11056930"," And hold this and have some continuation. "
"11061890","11062790"," To the upside."
"11063190","11065110"," This is where a bull could take another trade."
"11065410","11070530"," But as of right now, there with this breakdown here of HYG, not looking good. "
"11070790","11074290"," Looking like a reversal even up here."
"11074290","11078230"," So key level right now for key level right now for HYG."
"11083660","11087080"," It's going to be the seventy three zero three. "
"11087400","11090500"," Until HYG can reclaim that seventy three zero three."
"11090960","11094360"," Be very careful here for more downside to come."
"11095420","11097260"," You know, it really sucks as I had. "
"11097400","11098640"," I had a puts."
"11099740","11101280"," For Wednesday here."
"11101640","11103400"," I had a zero date for that. "
"11103560","11104760"," They weren't zero dates that time."
"11104900","11105620"," I think about them on Friday."
"11105620","11107980"," They were like three cents or something. "
"11107980","11109780"," But I had earlier last week."
"11109860","11112720"," I had said puts are expensive for Thursday Friday."
"11113380","11115260"," So of this upcoming week. "
"11115760","11117480"," So we'll see if there's continuation."
"11117980","11119700"," I'm going to try to get in on this with a trade up again."
"11120260","11122880"," So HYG specifically be very careful of. "
"11124420","11126100"," The role that's taking place."
"11126800","11127820"," And you can see right here."
"11127920","11130760"," We're sitting on a rug pull here on spy. "
"11135700","11137200"," Raise that up a little bit."
"11140970","11142010"," One minute remaining."
"11143030","11143610"," Hold on. "
"11143710","11145090"," We get back to spoos over here."
"11154540","11155640"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"11155820","11156400"," Look at that blood. "
"11157540","11159560"," Look at that blood down there."
"11159740","11162880"," And I want to bring your attention over here to."
"11163760","11165480"," We will really quick as well. "
"11165820","11169220"," Not guaranteed, but I want to show you something here."
"11169640","11172080"," And that's that reversal that's taking place."
"11176530","11178390"," Not there yet, but you can see it. "
"11178390","11184290"," And you can see it right here forming up on a one hour basis on spy."
"11184670","11186950"," So expect that more downside."
"11187330","11192630"," And even if you have that, if it bounces, I might even expect more downside that way right there. "
"11192730","11198370"," So even if you get a bounce down here, it's just another opportunity to short this market down."
"11198690","11200250"," And you've got the by the dip down here."
"11201510","11205810"," But this, this by the fucking dip is looking more juicy, isn't it?"
"11206230","11207130"," Still waiting for the data. "
"11208530","11209770"," That's looking more juicy."
"11210090","11210650"," And you can see."
"11211950","11213150"," I don't know if you can see it. "
"11213230","11214810"," This is the dip that I bought right here."
"11215470","11218070"," Can't come right down here at all that squeezing."
"11218830","11221950"," You know, if you come down here and we start going that way. "
"11225690","11228850"," From that roll rate is one hour roll above."
"11229130","11231210"," There could be some major downside to come."
"11231690","11232290"," Excuse me. "
"11234660","11237080"," So get your get your short on."
"11237740","11238820"," Damn right."
"11239940","11240540"," Hold on here. "
"11240620","11241460"," I'm going to probably place a trip."
"11241640","11242000"," Oh, maybe not."
"11242080","11242760"," We'll wait a minute here. "
"11242880","11246840"," A little bit late here trying to jump on the jump on a trade."
"11246960","11250980"," So hopefully you can catch a bounce here and jump on some short."
"11252320","11253660"," Let me just one quick second. "
"11254040","11254820"," I'll be back with you."
"11254860","11255380"," I'm going to go."
"11255600","11258180"," I have to make a phone call really quick to make a phone call. "
"11258720","11263120"," But if I have a chance to buy some puts here, I will."
"11263360","11264520"," And I'll let you know if I do that."
"11266400","11269120"," Raise this up right here so you can see it better. "
"11271660","11274620"," There's that first by the dip opportunity right down there."
"11278850","11280570"," Just sending it to the downside."
"11281030","11283250"," The first by the dip opportunity is four twenty eight. "
"11284650","11286490"," Four twenty fifty nine."
"11288010","11289790"," We'll write that down in here."
"11300240","11306600"," So the u.s. And could agree to hold off spending around six billion dollars in oil money. "
"11307000","11308820"," Fifty nine right about there."
"11310660","11319560"," So you see that by the dip downside to be expected to four twenty eight fifty nine four twenty"
"11319560","11320960"," fifty nine target day."
"11322040","11322880"," Maybe not. "
"11322880","11323700"," Maybe not in a day."
"11323800","11324540"," But somewhere down in there."
"11324560","11324820"," Which is. "
"11325060","11328900"," Kind of relief rally and then send it down to a four eighteen."
"11337710","11339630"," No, I don't see them crossing right now."
"11339910","11340430"," That's a good question. "
"11340770","11341670"," I don't see them crossing."
"11342690","11345430"," If they do cross, I'll will be afraid though."
"11345930","11347150"," It's still moving up too. "
"11347290","11350950"," So if you look at the daily trigger, you can see that it's actually moving up."
"11351150","11352150"," It's not following price."
"11352530","11357150"," You can actually see the bump up here unless we start to see this action coming down on the daily"
"11357150","11357370"," trigger. "
"11357370","11358390"," I'm not concerned at all."
"11359690","11360390"," This looks like."
"11360590","11362810"," This looks like people are taking profit pretty heavily. "
"11362870","11364570"," So to me at least that's what it looks like."
"11371380","11373880"," Yeah, I mean, if you want to give me four eighteen, I'll buy it."
"11374040","11375900"," If you want to give me four twenty eight, I'll buy it. "
"11376820","11378620"," If we reverse, I'll buy it."
"11382960","11384340"," But no reversal just yet."
"11385080","11385920"," There's no reversal. "
"11386220","11387460"," There's no dip to buy here."
"11390680","11391780"," No dip to buy here."
"11391980","11393460"," If there is a dip to buy, I'll let you know. "
"11393620","11394780"," But there is no dip to buy here."
"11400430","11400830"," Whoo."
"11402750","11405430"," Any of you switch to puts here and make a bunch of bank. "
"11405730","11408670"," There's a bunch of money in here whole bunch of money down in here."
"11428540","11430100"," You see how you can see all that there."
"11430560","11431920"," We're likely going down somewhere. "
"11432100","11433040"," We're not done going down."
"11435640","11436440"," Yeah, baby."
"11440840","11441600"," All right. "
"11441680","11442740"," I'll be back with you guys and above."
"11442960","11446160"," If I see it, I'm not going to buy puts right here because you know that goes right."
"11446680","11450420"," I buy some puts and then it squeezes up here and they're grinding them out. "
"11450540","11452680"," Then they finally put the fucking money on them down here."
"11452860","11458140"," So if we do get a squeeze up here at any point, I will grab some puts for more that"
"11458140","11459200"," more downside action."
"11460100","11462840"," I'll get left behind right now, but I know how this goes. "
"11463220","11466000"," Like I buy puts, squeezes that I'm fucked."
"11466080","11468660"," And then I'm like, oh fuck, I got to hold puts for the end of the day."
"11469380","11472320"," And they don't pay me some kind of late to the action here. "
"11472320","11475960"," But if we do get any kind of squeeze action, I'll jump in short."
"11475960","11477900"," Or with puts with with you today."
"11479120","11481620"," Otherwise just sitting here waiting, but you're a bull. "
"11481820","11482380"," You've got shit."
"11482560","11483760"," You got Jack shit today."
"11484060","11485300"," Don't do anything here. "
"11486620","11488120"," Do not be buying this."
"11490280","11491100"," I'll be right back."
"11541190","11542550"," Someone said I did buy this. "
"11542790","11544090"," You could probably buy this."
"11544090","11546010"," You could probably buy it for you."
"11546110","11548290"," You can catch the bounce here on us. "
"11548310","11549350"," Someone just said they bought it."
"11549350","11551290"," You can buy it for the bounce if you want to."
"11551890","11553950"," And the bottom screen down below. "
"11555330","11557590"," There's likely a five minute trade or something."
"11558710","11563910"," If you like wanting to buy this here and this and then, you know, this kind of action here."
"11564170","11566870"," I guess you could buy this if you wanted to because we are an S two here. "
"11567730","11568970"," But I wouldn't."
"11569090","11572610"," So you just wait until it stops and starts consolidating."
"11593300","11594760"," Maybe that's better right there. "
"11594760","11595820"," Maybe a better representation."
"11611500","11613700"," Someone was just asking about call spreads from yesterday."
"11614380","11616500"," You have multiple options. "
"11616840","11620840"," You can cut the bot call side loose if you wanted to."
"11621120","11624340"," The other option would be the call spreads are for December 29th."
"11624800","11626800"," So you have time for those two print. "
"11627120","11628680"," That's why the time is on that trade."
"11628860","11629600"," It's not on a trade."
"11630460","11634520"," That's, um, it's not like a weekly trade or a monthly trade or anything like that. "
"11642440","11643740"," I will say this though."
"11643740","11648640"," I will say this so on one hour here."
"11654370","11657430"," I will say this though on the weevil chart. "
"11662350","11664150"," I would fucking love."
"11665650","11666970"," I would fucking love."
"11667670","11669090"," I bought this one down here. "
"11669410","11670610"," I would fucking love."
"11672450","11674550"," Like I'm not hoping that this happens."
"11674850","11678010"," But if that did happen, I would fucking love to buy that dip. "
"11678230","11679310"," I would fucking love it."
"11679810","11683610"," So and that doesn't mean if you bought a call spread here yesterday or something like that."
"11684390","11686690"," The expectation is that we're going to go up there next. "
"11687050","11689150"," So you would still, but you'd still get paid up here."
"11689210","11692750"," It's one of the most beautiful parts of a call spread is it allows you."
"11693350","11694390"," It allows it. "
"11694470","11695550"," Well, hold on here."
"11695750","11696330"," That's all fucked up."
"11696630","11698290"," The S&P 500 index. "
"11698490","11699510"," It allows you that leeway."
"11700070","11701310"," So here's a prime example."
"11701550","11703070"," Down zero is about 7%. "
"11703530","11706330"," So I bought a call spread down here, right?"
"11706330","11711190"," And we came back down here twice and I didn't, I wasn't even concerned."
"11711490","11712670"," I was like, ah, that's all fine."
"11713130","11714190"," We didn't break down. "
"11714210","11716870"," We didn't have a breakdown below support."
"11717370","11718690"," So I felt fine."
"11718850","11720430"," I felt comfortable myself in that trade. "
"11721170","11721890"," Not as mean."
"11721890","11723250"," We're definitely going down here."
"11723350","11726630"," No, there's no guarantee we go all the way down here. "
"11726670","11728830"," We could spring right back up like it's nobody's business."
"11729690","11732510"," So for me, the trend is still up."
"11732510","11738690"," And even if it's something like this or even if it's a blood bath like that, you'll be right back"
"11738690","11739610"," in the money at some point. "
"11739710","11744290"," So one of the beautiful parts about a spread is that it might be all doom and gloom and then"
"11744290","11746250"," you look back at a week or two and you're like, ah, everything is fine."
"11746570","11747670"," A spread's doing just fine."
"11748470","11753950"," You're trying to burn theta, burn time and only be at your target by the 29th of December. "
"11754250","11757450"," So let's say you bought a call spread yesterday down here."
"11760070","11761910"," You're like, ah, but a call spread right here."
"11761910","11763450"," You're in the money and the money and the money. "
"11763590","11764270"," You're in the money right here."
"11764370","11764990"," You're in the money right here."
"11765030","11765570"," You're in the money right here. "
"11765570","11765690"," You're in the money right here."
"11765870","11767350"," It starts blasting down on you."
"11767470","11768730"," Let's say you got a big huge blood bath. "
"11769050","11771310"," It comes right back and you're right back in the money again."
"11771850","11777350"," It's not like a call that's like expiring on Friday and it's going to zero and you're fucked."
"11781030","11784070"," Somebody bought that dip. "
"11784270","11785390"," They said in the chat too."
"11785530","11790230"," They said they bought this S one S two and we're blasting right through it right now."
"11790230","11793970"," So I'm not a buyer here in any way, shape or form. "
"11794390","11799450"," And if anything, I'm looking for, if anything, I'm looking for juice."
"11799830","11800310"," Like I'm a bull."
"11800510","11803610"," So I'm like the more you want to sell it, the better off I am. "
"11806700","11807580"," Right down."

"14654690","14655490"," Okay. "
"14655530","14660430"," So let's take a look at a weeble for the net for tomorrow here."
"14675960","14677600"," Hold on here for a second."
"14680680","14682720"," Here's Friday here, right?"
"14682720","14687580"," And then we've got the unknowns coming into. "
"14689440","14691160"," So get this out of the way so you can see it."
"14692960","14695100"," We have the unknowns."
"14703390","14705120"," For the Israeli Hamas war. "
"14705990","14709650"," The Israeli Hamas war was not priced into the market, right?"
"14709790","14710310"," We know that."
"14711810","14718870"," Let's take a look at where's the early trigger right now."
"14725260","14727220"," Here's your daily trigger right here. "
"14732650","14739450"," Here's also your gamma flip."
"14746780","14748360"," These fucking bears, dude."
"14748580","14750120"," Never relentless on giving up. "
"14755360","14757160"," You got bulls all scared."
"14776070","14778390"," It's a nice nice bother dip down here."
"14778430","14781790"," Last week, this is back on the fourth and the sixth. "
"14782590","14783750"," Nice accumulation up here."
"14784150","14787790"," We were looking for consolidation above the hourly trigger."
"14787910","14789810"," And the daily trigger, not happening, right?"
"14790090","14796650"," Bears came in, sellers came in, sold down, rejected the hourly trigger, get our early trigger and"
"14796650","14800670"," blast down, trying to snag that weekly trigger. "
"14801370","14808890"," So just from where we are right now for price heading into tomorrow, this looks like it looks like"
"14808890","14811990"," an expectation of some kind of consolidation in here."
"14812970","14815670"," We do have also have earnings."
"14815670","14819990"," I mean, they started saying we had some airlines earnings and stuff, but big earnings with the"
"14819990","14822310"," banks that really matter tomorrow, right?"
"14822490","14827390"," Begin with Wells Fargo, some other some other banks and stuff. "
"14827550","14830210"," And then we launch into the big boys next week."
"14830950","14832770"," This might be the gift for you."
"14832830","14839030"," If you're looking for a gift in terms of looking for a gift in terms of a dip to buy,"
"14839170","14840210"," this is kind of nice, right?"
"14840710","14843230"," I would really like to buy this by the dip down here. "
"14843230","14848770"," At this 425.59 and then down here, lower at this 420."
"14849830","14855290"," So the reason why I have these up here is because of the gamma models that we showed you earlier"
"14855290","14856010"," this morning."
"14857090","14858990"," Now, if this is just a hit and run. "
"14860150","14864970"," If this is just a hit and run and you see price recover, I want to show you this right"
"14864970","14865270"," now."
"14865430","14867150"," So if we recover, watch this."
"14868430","14870110"," It's a 15 minute chart right here. "
"14870170","14871270"," Let me go back to a five minute chart."
"14874110","14876110"," If you end up seeing."
"14878680","14883080"," If you end up seeing a recovery to the upside above. "
"14883760","14886300"," 435 situation is normal, right?"
"14886960","14889580"," If you see this play out right here, if you see this."
"14893440","14896000"," You see this turnaround up here, right?"
"14898590","14901630"," And you see price reverse and continue to the upside."
"14902610","14904010"," Alright, blast up here. "
"14904490","14906950"," Bounce off of this hourly trigger."
"14907730","14909790"," Come back on high here, reject that."
"14910170","14914090"," Remember this point right here is important for you, right?"
"14914510","14915610"," If we bounce right here. "
"14916750","14918990"," I'm going to take a big long right in there."
"14920290","14926350"," Okay, so that 435 ish if we regain all this and confirm that we're going to go higher on the"
"14926350","14927970"," hourly and the daily trigger."
"14928530","14929770"," I'll pick up a long here. "
"14929770","14932810"," But without that happening, that hasn't happened yet."
"14932810","14935290"," There's no real like long trade here for a bull."
"14935930","14944970"," So until that happens, right, the expectation is going to be that we will reject this daily trigger"
"14944970","14947550"," and look for real support lower. "
"14947850","14955650"," We do already know that the buyers earlier in this week and last week were lower."
"14955890","14956510"," They were down here."
"14957530","14960190"," First buy point here, second buy point here. "
"14960810","14962570"," And right now, this one's just screaming."
"14963130","14964210"," Come on down and see me."
"14964370","14965910"," Come on down and see me so I can buy a dip. "
"14966250","14967690"," Now, this could have been the bottom right here."
"14967730","14968990"," I'm in some zero dates right now."
"14969070","14972310"," Some zero date calls down here in case this was just a hit and run. "
"14972570","14978270"," I haven't seen the daily trigger roll over yet below the weekly trigger."
"14978850","14981370"," The hourly trigger is coming down to that daily."
"14981690","14984590"," Like this one right here is moving down currently. "
"14985530","14986930"," Sliding now, it's not quite there yet."
"14986930","14988370"," It's at 435 55."
"14989050","14991850"," So it's like right about here. "
"14995250","14999330"," So to get bullish, you need to be above this green bar."
"14999590","15000930"," It hasn't crossed yet."
"15001450","15002790"," This hasn't come down here. "
"15003290","15006390"," We haven't rejected down here yet to get extremely bearish."
"15006690","15012030"," But even so, if you're a seller, you are looking, if you're a seller out there, you are looking for"
"15012030","15014130"," that rejection up here."
"15014130","15018370"," You are looking for some kind of a bull trap up here. "
"15019010","15020610"," Some kind of rejection right here."
"15020950","15022990"," Some kind of rejection right here to the downside."
"15023470","15028310"," So until this clears itself up, no trade as a bull. "
"15028530","15033170"," You have to get above this and begin to make your way back to the upside as a bull."
"15033350","15039850"," So right now, into this close, you are being set up for continued downside into Friday."
"15039850","15045750"," If you are a bull, you'll be giving a zero-date trade in here, but you've got no trade until"
"15045750","15052290"," you get back above this 435 to get bullish for that continuation to the upside. "
"15053870","15056030"," So no big trades for me today."
"15056130","15057170"," I'm not going to take this one."
"15057650","15066230"," What I really would like to do is buy successful retest here to the upside or a rejection and trade"
"15066230","15070150"," down to those two targets that I gave you to the downside. "
"15070670","15073530"," So we'll see what the bears do up here if they try to sell this."
"15073850","15079650"," If they try to pin this into the close-on S1, any of that kind of stuff, still long calls."
"15079850","15080650"," They haven't sold any calls. "
"15081130","15083110"," As a matter of fact, they're not paying me either."
"15083110","15088930"," I'm up like five cents right now, six cents, but that's it."
"15089070","15093410"," So I'm going to hold these calls, see if you can trade this up into the daily trigger into the"
"15093410","15094430"," close until we get some rejection. "
"15094430","15100270"," But even if we do get that rejection, if you are a bull looking for a dip to buy, my"
"15100270","15102730"," dip buy is somewhere right here."
"15103310","15106770"," It's been a Friday and somewhere down here in this by the fucking dip."
"15107430","15113090"," So until this happens or we get above this gamma flip, no long-term calls for me. "
"15113590","15114610"," None of that kind of stuff."
"15114770","15116550"," You guys know I already sold my call spreads."
"15117410","15118870"," I believe it was yesterday I sold calls. "
"15119170","15123550"," Yesterday before I sold call spreads, it was two days ago right here on the 10th."
"15123550","15126150"," On that massive squeeze that we took up there."
"15126710","15128370"," So no call spreads for me here. "
"15128490","15130090"," I want to see one of those three things."
"15130210","15136570"," I want to see the, I want to see this break above in continuation, or I want to see the"
"15136570","15141230"," roll down to this by the dip down here or the one that's down below that for 18."
"15141590","15146090"," Either one of those three options, I'll go along with money and all that kind of shit. "
"15146810","15150050"," But until that point, just zero to eight buy and zero to eight buy this shit."
"15150730","15153250"," All this garbage you roll down here, I'll buy that shit."
"15153690","15154510"," And we'll be off and running. "
"15155930","15157590"," So expectations for tomorrow."
"15157790","15160950"," If you want the expectation for tomorrow, this is a trap being set up."
"15161330","15167310"," You're likely going to get those morning, those morning bank earnings, and they're going to set the"
"15167310","15169610"," tone for earning season. "
"15170030","15172170"," So tomorrow is a big day for setting the tone."
"15172610","15175010"," Sorry airline's not setting the tone for you."
"15175330","15179010"," You're going to be looking for that tone to be set by those earnings tomorrow. "
"15183340","15184860"," Yeah, I think they park it."
"15185000","15186040"," I think they park it."
"15186200","15188040"," I think they park it right here. "
"15188580","15190520"," And I think the idea would be that you park this."
"15191340","15195760"," And then you wait for those morning earnings and you're either going to get that set the tone by"
"15195760","15199360"," banks or we're going to continue up for the rest of earning season."
"15200120","15202580"," Now there is something to be said about earning season. "
"15202840","15203800"," We're coming into it."
"15204360","15209280"," Generally speaking, we're coming into earning season quite low, right?"
"15209480","15211240"," We're way down here."
"15211900","15215400"," So we're not, it's not like we're heading into earning season right now. "
"15217020","15220480"," It's not like we're heading into earning season parked at 457."
"15221480","15223280"," We're pretty fucking low down here."
"15223820","15228360"," So as long as we can reverse this to the upside, you can, this is a daily chart. "
"15228560","15230220"," Matter of fact, it's a great try to be looking at right now."
"15230880","15238720"," Because if you see this, if you see this reversal to the upside here on daily trend, if you can"
"15238720","15242040"," see this regaining, you know, they park this shit right here today."
"15242420","15246220"," And then you're going to be getting good bank earnings and we're often running again to the upside"
"15246220","15250000"," for those higher targets for 51 and all that kind of stuff over there. "
"15250040","15252420"," So it looks like they're going to park it into tomorrow."
"15253200","15254120"," I'm going to show these."
"15260000","15262280"," Show all the, oh, I'm showing all this again. "
"15265400","15266720"," Back to a five minute chart."
"15267340","15270620"," So it does look like they're going to park this shit in here into tomorrow."
"15270620","15272040"," Do I expect weakness?"
"15272740","15272960"," I do. "
"15273260","15279200"," I'll expect like, I will expect, well, kind of, we're not, there's not really like, so when we're"
"15279200","15283340"," below gamma flip, you should expect futures to buy this."
"15283780","15286220"," What you'll likely see is cash market last till six."
"15286980","15289780"," You'll also then see futures buy this shit. "
"15290080","15293200"," And then by six a.m, you'll see weakness until they report."
"15293900","15294600"," We make a decision."
"15294980","15296540"," So all this shit is garbage in here. "
"15296960","15298560"," I got nothing for you and overnight."
"15298560","15303560"," I wouldn't expect much in the overnight other than this kind of shit until you start getting those"
"15303560","15304960"," releases in the morning tomorrow."
"15304980","15310420"," So until that happens, well, I'm going to expect into the close today that we trade up to the daily"
"15310420","15310700"," trigger. "
"15310700","15311520"," That's right here."
"15311600","15312940"," Let me go back here and show you this."
"15313760","15315540"," Let's just right up here in here. "
"15316340","15318780"," Some kind of squeezing action into this close."
"15320540","15329380"," Right up in here and I wouldn't doubt us to sell this at four to six p.m. You have"
"15329380","15330480"," to also think about Europe."
"15330900","15334220"," The one thing I'm going to leave you with today and to the end of this day is this. "
"15335160","15337840"," And that is be fucking careful."
"15338100","15339620"," We talked this morning on the open."
"15340200","15345780"," When we came on the show this morning, we said to you that they have not priced in this war"
"15345780","15346100"," yet. "
"15346140","15347740"," You might think, yeah, they're not going to."
"15347780","15348560"," Nothing's going to happen."
"15348880","15350760"," We talked about Qatar, Saudi Arabia. "
"15351420","15356340"," And we talked about Israel trying to ramp up and expand this war."
"15357000","15362480"," And tomorrow, the 11th to the 18th, we said 11th to the 15th, possibly running into the 18th."
"15363440","15368140"," There should be, you should at least have some kind of a plan for that. "
"15368340","15372100"," As a matter of fact, this morning at nine 30, we said to you, don't come back in two days"
"15372100","15374840"," and see the market drop two, three, four points."
"15375740","15376540"," And you didn't have a plan."
"15376740","15377160"," I'm just long. "
"15377580","15378260"," I just own the market."
"15378840","15380420"," I've got no put back spreads on."
"15380520","15381320"," I've got no zero dates. "
"15381560","15382640"," I've got no cheap hedge."
"15383000","15383580"," Nothing like that."
"15383920","15384640"," I've got no stops. "
"15385060","15385800"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"15385800","15390760"," As a matter of fact, I think I deleted this stuff up here, but no, I didn't."
"15390900","15393120"," So right here, you got your stops right here. "
"15393780","15394240"," Right."
"15394340","15396180"," You should have at least gotten stopped out here."
"15396400","15399400"," You had a, you had a change above right here. "
"15399640","15403860"," Positioning went from green to red right there."
"15404460","15408300"," So right there, we went from green to red in the positioning long short."
"15408300","15413000"," This was your first indicator telling you, get out of your lungs, right?"
"15413380","15413680"," Right here. "
"15413680","15415300"," Right at 11."
"15415600","15415700"," All right."
"15415880","15417160"," 1 p.m. 103. "
"15417800","15422520"," And then down here, if you had stops, you should have triggered them down below."
"15422860","15426460"," You should have not gotten caught in any of this here to the downside."
"15426720","15430620"," Now, I don't know if this is a hit and run or not, but this does look like they're setting"
"15430620","15433080"," up for two things. "
"15433580","15434240"," Earning season."
"15434880","15438180"," How does the tone get set by banks reporting?"
"15438180","15443860"," And then the next thing that you have to look forward to or not look forward to, but not look"
"15443860","15449640"," forward to, I guess, would be do they do, do we end up having any kind of craziness over the"
"15449640","15449920"," weekend?"
"15450480","15454420"," So if you don't, if you're not here tomorrow on this stream, I want to express something important"
"15454420","15455040"," to you."
"15455320","15461340"," Do not be long into this weekend Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday without some kind of hedge in"
"15461340","15461800"," this market. "
"15462120","15465900"," You do not want to wake up over the weekend and see, I don't fucking know."
"15466000","15467280"," What's that thing they use there?"
"15468040","15469920"," Weekend Dow, weekend bow."
"15470540","15476040"," And watch the weekend bow be down minus 300 points for the DIA minus 500 points. "
"15476100","15480600"," And then some wild shit goes out on the weekend that you're not expecting from that war."
"15480900","15481020"," Okay."
"15483880","15488700"," Yeah, if you're like, so when Friday comes between here and Friday, I'm going to end up having a"
"15488700","15493640"," bunch of cheap ass zero dates for Monday, zero day puts for protection. "
"15493640","15497580"," It's like a cost of doing business, even if you are long, even if you are bullish."
"15497580","15499100"," I'm bullish here, by the way, if you want to know."
"15499500","15500200"," I'm bullish yesterday. "
"15500460","15500960"," Bullish today."
"15500960","15503720"," I'm bullish on this market up into the right."
"15503720","15508620"," And seasonally, we should go up into the right into the end of year. "
"15509360","15514960"," So if we, so this morning there was an article put out by CNBC that showed some data suggesting"
"15514960","15524200"," that the last 10, the last 10 years we've had a very positive January through July, we've been down"
"15524200","15526060"," in August and September."
"15526720","15529720"," And we've closed the year, the Q four up."
"15530500","15533960"," Two percent, I believe, and we're down six right now. "
"15534140","15535980"," So we should be up by December."
"15537220","15540140"," Eight percent from current price."
"15540720","15542220"," It's actually measure that right now. "
"15542340","15543340"," Let's take a look at that real quick."
"15544200","15545660"," So if we measure."
"15546760","15548800"," An eight percent move up. "
"15548800","15550260"," Let me get rid of all this."
"15552880","15557420"," If we measure eight percent from, let's call it daily trigger somewhere in here, right?"
"15558000","15560140"," If we're up eight percent by December."
"15561500","15565920"," Every, I think it's every prior example in the past of us having that year. "
"15566840","15569100"," We end up, uh, hold on a second, we find this thing."
"15570700","15571960"," That we wind up."
"15573820","15577720"," See if we can, let's see if we can show where the end of year projections are. "
"15585430","15586670"," Are you ready for it?"
"15587290","15589230"," You're probably not."
"15593280","15595620"," Does anybody have on their bingo card?"
"15597900","15598420"," 469."
"15599680","15603920"," Does anybody have on their bingo card 469 by December, uh, 29?"
"15606420","15608640"," Does anybody have that on their bingo card?"
"15608860","15610440"," I'm going to assume that half of you don't. "
"15611220","15612060"," Probably more."
"15614000","15619760"," Do any of you have an 8% up move into the end of Q4 at some point in Q4"
"15619760","15621400"," from current price?"
"15622360","15625340"," We could even assign it to like 435 from 435."
"15625800","15626960"," Does anybody out there?"
"15627780","15628380"," Let me know in the chat. "
"15628720","15632360"," Do you think that we'll trade 470 between now and the end of Q4?"
"15633500","15633620"," Land."
"15633800","15636240"," I'll, I'll be fizzling to find that article for you from CNBC."
"15645580","15647720"," I'm going to find that article for you here really quick. "

"15649680","15651460"," They just read it like a couple hours ago."
"15651480","15652120"," Hold on here. "
"15654560","15655460"," I'm not seeing it."
"15658680","15659220"," Hold on."
"15659300","15660080"," I'm going to find it here. "
"15666980","15670640"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got all these fucking bond traders want me to buy bonds."
"15670640","15672240"," I'm like, get fucked with your bond trade."
"15673120","15674440"," I'm not an old man. "
"15674660","15675580"," I want danger."
"15677220","15679060"," Bond markets like come by the bond."
"15679080","15680420"," It's going to outperform stock market. "
"15680500","15682500"," I'm like, yeah, I'm good with that and good."
"15683500","15686140"," I'm going to find that article from this morning that I read from CNBC."
"15689080","15690960"," I'll post it on Twitter today. "
"15691020","15691580"," I'll post it later."
"15691740","15695180"," At some point later today, I'll find that in my history and post it on Twitter for you."
"15695540","15697080"," I don't have it in front of me, but they were saying. "
"15698960","15705400"," That they were looking back on years that had a 10 plus 10% plus or more."
"15706040","15707960"," From January to July."
"15709860","15713180"," That August and September wind up every time. "
"15713180","15719820"," Our down months and then the Q4 turns into a 2% or I think it was 2% up"
"15719820","15722780"," from its previous high in that time period."
"15722780","15724700"," So that would be we're down 6% right now."
"15724700","15732920"," That'd be about 8% increase in SP and SPX by the time we get to the end of Q4. "
"15734240","15736000"," I'll post that for you today."
"15737040","15741120"," So if you want to know, like my bullish, my bearish here, I'm just looking to get a fucking dip,"
"15741120","15741440"," dude."
"15741440","15743860"," I'm just looking for another goddamn dip to get. "
"15744940","15746360"," Still long calls here."
"15746760","15747320"," Have not sold."
"15747480","15748100"," They were bouncing around. "
"15748260","15750300"," They're like 20 cents, 29 cents."
"15750820","15752100"," At one point, they're at 36 cents."
"15752300","15755940"," Right now they're only trading 26 cents right now. "
"15756040","15757100"," So we'll see what happens here."
"15757580","15759520"," I don't want to get reversed as we head into."
"15759880","15764040"," What I don't want to do is this shit to happen here. "
"15765120","15769640"," I don't want to see like the squeeze up and then the reversal to the downside of this close."
"15769640","15773800"," So one way or another, I'm going to I'm going to have to close these bad boys out."
"15773800","15775320"," So we'll see how this happens here. "
"15775440","15776780"," See if I can get out of this trade."
"15777480","15779880"," I'm still up green right now, but nothing significant."
"15780220","15780880"," Just pennies. "
"15785720","15787620"," Yeah, come on, cap chicks dig bonds."
"15787940","15791520"," Yeah, dude, they keep like, I keep like all these fucking bond articles."

"15800800","15802960"," told that about mid caps all these years."
"15802960","15804760"," And I'm like, I know exactly how this goes."
"15805180","15806160"," They wrap you into bonds. "
"15806240","15810760"," They wrap you into small caps mid caps and then fucking NASDAQ just screams higher."
"15811060","15811880"," You're just like, fuck."
"15812360","15813720"," So about fucking NASDAQ. "

"15852050","15855930"," So they were looking through some and you guys already saw the seasonality chart. "
"15856210","15856230"," Right."
"15856310","15858050"," I've shown you guys that ad nauseam at this point."
"15858790","15863490"," That we should get like the one low and then one more low and then we should grind sideways and"
"15863490","15864910"," up into the end of the quarter. "
"15865510","15866990"," You guys have already seen that, right?"
"15867130","15869470"," You've seen the posts on the website and all that other shit."
"15872430","15873810"," Yeah, that's right, greasy fingers."

"15890240","15890580"," the bears."

"15902500","15905580"," YouTube chat right now and Floyd's garage had mentioned something about it."
"15906180","15912200"," If you are a bank trader, should we look at some of the shit coming out tomorrow?"
"15913040","15915480"," Let me see if I can give me a second here now. "
"15918940","15919760"," What are we doing?"

"15932990","15934450"," Let's zoom in, bro."
"15935390","15938750"," Pretend we're like CSI there or some shit like that. "
"15938870","15939910"," Something that's not really real."
"15942370","15943530"," Am I going the wrong way?"
"15943630","15944070"," There we go."
"15945150","15946090"," We got BlackRock. "
"15946930","15951130"," We got JP Morgan, Citibank, PNC, Wells Fargo, Progressive, United Health Group."
"15951930","15953330"," Dude, United Health Group."
"15953510","15955250"," We're going to look at United Health Group really quick, too. "
"15956910","15958070"," Don't ask me why here."
"15958470","15961190"," Trading 33 right now on 434 C's."
"15961630","15963770"," Coming up in a resistance right now in the daily trigger. "
"15964270","15966630"," This is the place for you to run."
"15966950","15969450"," If you're going to run, this is it right here."
"15971650","15972830"," And I'm going to bring as soon as we come. "
"15973150","15973530"," You know what?"
"15973690","15973890"," Fuck it."
"15973990","15974570"," Hold on a second here."
"15980540","15981060"," All right. "
"15981220","15982640"," So I'm taking 32 right now."
"15982640","15985720"," I'm going to get out of my trade and I'm going to talk to you guys about."
"15986800","15990180"," We're going to go over and look at a few of these things for tomorrow. "
"15990180","15991280"," So let's look at Wells Fargo."
"15993340","15995060"," What a piece of shit bank."
"15998080","15999240"," Fucking Wells Fargo. "
"15999820","16003600"," What a dog shit like what a dog shit company."
"16004600","16008320"," It's no offense to Wells Fargo, but talk about scumbags."
"16010140","16011560"," But they are a bank, aren't they?"
"16011560","16017260"," So if you guys have any tickers, you want me to review for tomorrow's earnings, we can. "
"16017740","16019040"," This looks good to me."
"16020360","16022720"," Believe it or not, Wells Fargo for tomorrow."
"16022940","16025500"," You guys want some expectations for Wells Fargo tomorrow?"
"16026220","16028080"," I think they rip fucking faces off. "
"16029140","16030680"," So just this right here."
"16030800","16034820"," Just watching this 30 minutes right here without doing anything with you right now."
"16035820","16039700"," Watching this down move right here. "
"16040720","16044440"," Higher lows on hourly weakness right here, weakness right here."
"16044520","16051080"," But for me for Wells Fargo, I think they have a beat price target to the upside, $42."
"16053840","16055040"," United, how care?"
"16056460","16056760"," Yeah, dude. "
"16056920","16058540"," I'm going to tell you guys something, man."
"16059360","16063260"," I'm going to tell you guys something like coming into this earnings season is a fucking gift."
"16064460","16065040"," Do I do that right?"
"16065300","16066020"," I think I got that wrong. "
"16067460","16068740"," Let me get the wrong ticker."
"16072020","16074140"," Didn't they just, they just bought out a bunch of a."
"16078770","16079350"," Oh, dude."
"16079490","16081270"," What's the ticker symbol for United healthcare?"
"16082270","16082630"," Fuck me. "
"16084910","16085530"," Is it."
"16088890","16091210"," Don't ask me why I'm interested in this, but."
"16096450","16098810"," I can't tell you why I'm interested in this. "
"16100670","16102110"," Oh, it's a UNH dude."
"16102150","16103050"," I should have known that shit."
"16103150","16103630"," It was a UNH. "
"16103690","16105230"," What the fuck is wrong with me?"
"16106390","16108190"," Mine going a million miles an hour."
"16110350","16112050"," Oh, yeah, it's already going up right now."
"16112090","16112750"," Look at that shit. "
"16113810","16114610"," United healthcare."
"16115670","16116490"," It should be going up."
"16116570","16118630"," This is where I know a lot about United healthcare in the background. "
"16118830","16121250"," I can't talk to you guys about United healthcare."
"16122730","16123930"," Take the money and run."
"16124810","16127410"," Whatever their ER should be good. "
"16128310","16129230"," Price target."
"16130050","16131230"," On United health."
"16131470","16132650"," I'm going to tell you right now. "
"16132990","16134850"," They're fucking they should be good."
"16135550","16137110"," They should be really good."
"16137470","16138950"," Price target on United healthcare. "
"16139810","16140670"," I can measure this."
"16141250","16142870"," Whatever their report is."
"16143250","16144590"," I'm going to tell you this on United healthcare. "
"16146530","16147130"," Whatever."
"16147570","16148590"," How much is that right there?"
"16149850","16150930"," Four fifty two."
"16152930","16154050"," Oh, Jesus Christ. "
"16154290","16155010"," Hundred fucking points."
"16155890","16157670"," Price target for United healthcare tomorrow."
"16158130","16158590"," Five fifty. "
"16159650","16160450"," I don't know."
"16160550","16162350"," I don't even know what's expected on it."
"16162450","16162970"," But regardless. "
"16164350","16168030"," Expect some profit taking on that on United healthcare tomorrow."
"16168310","16169470"," So be careful of that one."
"16169930","16171370"," If you win United healthcare. "
"16172450","16172750"," It should."
"16172930","16173650"," They should be good."
"16175670","16176870"," They should be good. "
"16176870","16178410"," But even if they are."
"16178810","16179690"," Take the money and run."
"16180050","16180990"," I would not be trading calls. "
"16181010","16181890"," Maybe but."
"16182550","16184910"," I don't know that I be trading calls on United healthcare."
"16185190","16187610"," I just like own the underlying and then sell out. "
"16188330","16191010"," In the early morning hours and get the fuck on out of there."
"16191350","16192050"," United healthcare."
"16192550","16193270"," I'm bullish on it. "
"16193590","16194250"," With a cell."
"16194950","16195650"," Wells Fargo."
"16196250","16198430"," I am bullish on there on their earnings tomorrow. "
"16199270","16200150"," You're going to do JPM."
"16200970","16201310"," Hold on here."
"16211310","16215030"," Yeah, like United healthcare is looking for a reason to roll. "
"16215530","16216630"," But I do see the squeeze."
"16218730","16219250"," JPM."
"16219990","16222110"," Take a look at JPM, baby. "
"16224010","16226130"," Dude, I'm bullish on JPM too."
"16226470","16227790"," Dude, I'm bullish on banks."
"16228130","16229670"," I bet you nobody's bullish on banks. "
"16230350","16232950"," I'm bullish as fuck on banks right now."
"16233010","16234190"," Now saying that."
"16235050","16236890"," Let's look at something on banks here. "
"16237910","16239410"," Let's look at a 30 minute chart."
"16240270","16241050"," Let's look at this."
"16241150","16242050"," Keep it on this daily here. "
"16242570","16244150"," This looks bullish to me, right?"
"16244910","16246070"," See this right here?"
"16247130","16253010"," This looks bullish on their earnings, but what is making me really weary here is this right here."
"16254030","16259850"," So it's almost like a rip up on JPM and an immediate sell down."
"16260150","16261610"," So maybe we are. "
"16262690","16270750"," Maybe we, there is a possibility here that you're going to see a lot of like individual ticker"
"16270750","16274490"," trading rather than necessarily index."
"16275670","16280610"," Like if you do well, you're going to squeeze the fuck out of these tickers to the upside."
"16280930","16285750"," Like JPM is an upside target of like 175, dude. "
"16286090","16286210"," 175."
"16286210","16291650"," Now you know that they, you know they're going to only trade tomorrow like 155."
"16292770","16294210"," I know they'll trade tomorrow. "
"16294290","16296450"," They'll trade 150 to one or something like that."
"16297890","16302210"," It's like, yeah, I got a target here of like 151 right here."
"16302690","16306090"," And then another target right here in JPM right there. "
"16306810","16311970"," But you could see like if they do really well, it would be hilarious if they did well in their"
"16311970","16312270"," earnings."
"16312930","16314170"," Be fucking hilarious."
"16314410","16318570"," Like, oh, we wound up doing this and we're up here, but it does look like it wants to sell"
"16318570","16319810"," immediately after going up there. "
"16319970","16326730"," So I'm bullish on these companies, but I think it might be take the money and run."
"16327390","16329010"," I think it might be take money and run."
"16329150","16330630"," Let's look at the half hour on JPM. "
"16333510","16340090"," You know, like the way what's weird is that looking at, yeah, that looks fucking sexy right there."
"16340090","16342010"," That's so sexy, JPM."

"16345630","16350030"," 30 minute trigger is what I like to use to trade intraday stuff."

"16354550","16356490"," I'm going to change my expectation on JPM. "
"16358190","16360050"," I'm bullish on Wells Fargo."
"16362610","16369910"," I think that JPM, if they've got a neutral to an okay earnings is caught more kind of like a,"
"16370090","16371370"," whoop, and then down."
"16372530","16378230"," Whoop, and then down like maybe one for, I said one fifty one forty nine and then a reversal to"
"16378230","16379370"," the downside and consolidate. "
"16380250","16386990"," I'm going to expect JPM to give a neutral like slightly bullish, but not necessarily."
"16388369","16390330"," Hey, that was a fucking great quarter."
"16390529","16390730"," So. "
"16392430","16396950"," If I had if I had to guess here JPM is okay, but not great."
"16397650","16399689"," So bullish on Wells Fargo."
"16401990","16403430"," Mixed bag on JPM. "
"16404750","16407009"," Like it should come in like like they should beat."
"16407110","16408090"," They should like meet estimates."
"16408930","16412390"," And then I am bullish on United health, but. "
"16413330","16415390"," I think they profit take off it."

"16493900","16495380"," And that's that's my most bullish pick."
"16496360","16497840"," And then JPM."
"16499200","16499640"," Neutral. "

"16524480","16530500"," You're your best bet for an option where it will continue to run is likely Wells Fargo."
"16531740","16533599"," That's my favorite pick out of the bunch. "
"16533599","16537220"," Do you guys disagree with those estimates or agree with those estimates?"
"16538020","16538340"," Let me know."

"16560029","16561150"," I got to be honest with you. "
"16562270","16567990"," I'm looking at the charts I would have expected bad news for Wells Fargo like off the top right"
"16567990","16568230"," away."
"16569189","16571930"," You guys see me do these earnings seasons, right?"
"16572070","16572310"," We get them."
"16572509","16573169"," We're pretty good. "
"16573230","16574750"," We get them pretty right."
"16575050","16578390"," So I have high hopes for these picks right here."
"16578450","16581009"," I will say I will make a comment here though. "
"16581529","16582830"," If you do see."
"16583890","16585430"," Bad bank earnings tomorrow."
"16586210","16587750"," Watch the fuck out. "
"16587750","16592250"," There is some there in this earning season specifically."
"16592830","16597470"," I want to make two comp two or three comments to you that always are important to remember."
"16598310","16600830"," These are things that I kind of live by number one. "
"16601009","16605130"," Early marks on close imbalance currently sitting at 71 million to the buy."
"16605290","16606250"," Maybe more than one comment."
"16607090","16608330"," One comment is this. "
"16609230","16614050"," I'm not a fan of trading like calls into earnings."
"16614050","16619730"," I really like to synthetically trade them through NASDAQ or spy."
"16620410","16627150"," Because you have a more of a window and options for like a 15 minute window before the close for"
"16627150","16628230"," four o'clock to four 15. "
"16628390","16633210"," We can usually this stream is basically capture that money and get out for actually here."
"16633509","16634550"," There's a sell right."
"16634750","16638349"," So given the report and it goes up and then it takes right. "
"16638529","16638849"," Don't come."
"16640250","16641669"," So here we talk about this."
"16643610","16645290"," There's a there's a bunch of rules here. "
"16645550","16650950"," Number one dealers love to trade both sides of the expected move on an earnings report."
"16651730","16655250"," So they hit the upside move unless it runs away and they have to chase."
"16655930","16659310"," They will end up trading in that week the up and down side move. "
"16660250","16664230"," Personally my best wins are always synthetically trading these big."
"16665130","16670250"," These big reports through cues or spy."
"16670250","16675730"," I don't recommend anyone ever buy like zero date puts and calls into. "
"16676290","16678050"," A report."
"16680790","16685849"," So I'm going to say that as well that you should have made your trades before that kind of stuff"
"16685849","16688890"," and you're being giving an opportunity right now to."
"16689450","16695570"," If you want to express that that bullishness or that bearishness through the indexes. "
"16697230","16699849"," I wish I'd spent more time doing this today."
"16700050","16704689"," If I have time tonight I'll try to put out some expectations for each one of these stickers on"
"16704689","16705950"," Twitter if I can tonight."
"16706869","16713570"," But some other key points here would be the banks should set the tone tomorrow for earnings. "
"16714390","16718450"," Also look for the first tech earnings to set the tone for tech as well."
"16719490","16721790"," And coupled with all of that right now you're dealing with."
"16722630","16723650"," You're dealing with. "
"16726009","16732810"," You're dealing with all this overhang from fucking Hamas and fucking Israel and all that shit."
"16733250","16735750"," All the other garbage that you're dealing with right now so."
"16737090","16741810"," Kind of a complicated year or a quarter I should say is kind of a complicated. "
"16742230","16743770"," Quarter here for you if you are."
"16744550","16745849"," If you are a."
"16746650","16747810"," Put this on here."
"16749070","16751930"," That nice green 30 minute 30 minute bar right there. "
"16752810","16755009"," Everybody panicking freaking out."
"16755450","16759270"," They got bulls trying to say they're going to sell their spreads and I'm like don't fucking sell"
"16759270","16759770"," those spreads."
"16760990","16763369"," I'm fucking dated for December for a reason. "
"16764890","16766009"," What else we got here."
"16766770","16769169"," Big short on Wells Fargo I agree with that."
"16769990","16771970"," Wells Fargo off the top. "
"16771970","16773990"," If you ask me just walking down the street."
"16774669","16778630"," If you were like hey what do you most bearish on for tomorrow I would just scream Wells Fargo."
"16779250","16780190"," But look at that chart. "
"16781210","16782650"," I think they're going to trap those fuckers."
"16787990","16794030"," Yeah Turkey I get your brother I get what you're saying Turkey's looking for that guiding down."
"16795050","16798810"," And I agree with you Turkey if you get that if you get that like sentiment. "
"16799750","16803450"," Bank set in the tone for negativity that will be the."
"16804210","16807410"," That will be the drum beat into that first big tech earnings."

"17607720","17608220"," Consolidate. "
"17609800","17611420"," And then buy a dip right there."
"17611420","17613240"," So buy the dip."
"17614620","17619040"," So I either need to see the squeeze up in price. "
"17619460","17620240"," Come back down."

"17690590","17691610"," No big trades."
"17692070","17697610"," I need to see price above the hourly trigger and the daily trigger. "
"17697910","17701030"," And the key point is squeeze up and hold it."
"17701690","17702710"," Can start going up."
"17708480","17710500"," That looks all wonky down there. "
