"119840","122400"," Probably need my hair or something."
"123180","123940"," My hair is all crazy."
"124280","124820"," It took a shower. "
"127979","129160"," Didn't quite get ready."
"129160","131580"," Coming right into R1 right now."
"133800","136380"," Like it's nothing like butter. "
"140100","143300"," Oh, oh, how'd that feel?"
"144060","145600"," How's that for an opening quarter?"
"147200","148120"," How's that about?"
"148400","149000"," How's that for?"

"157100","158320"," How's that feel pretty good?"
"164920","166580"," What do we have above it?"

"188920","192580"," We'll take a look here across the landscape. "
"197540","200280"," I'm going to bet that everybody was short."
"202860","204160"," If I had to guess."
"206720","208160"," Everybody was short. "
"210440","212920"," Oh, yeah, what's going on up there?"
"214180","214900"," Oh, baby."
"215880","216760"," So much."
"217460","218620"," Look at that R3 up there. "
"220780","222400"," Pairs in the veil right here."
"222600","223880"," Pairs in the veil up here."
"224620","225860"," Take a closer look at it. "

"234960","236220"," Second tick somewhere up in here."
"237820","240220"," We've got another couple of guys hanging out back here."
"240220","241380"," We've got some. "
"242620","244140"," We've got this little guy right here."

"271940","272420"," First."

"285350","285650"," Look at that."
"285790","286270"," Repricing. "
"287590","288250"," Inflation's coming."
"288510","289590"," Roaring back, baby."
"289790","291230"," You got to reprice that stock market. "
"292150","293630"," You got to pass the buck."
"294410","295970"," Four eleven thirty one."
"299330","299810"," Slamming. "
"301770","303810"," Kevin James is streaming right now."
"303950","304170"," Let's see."
"304270","304770"," How do we get back?"
"304770","305210"," Let me see. "
"305290","307090"," I want to see your channel."
"307390","308270"," Oh, there goes the comments."
"308610","308930"," There we go. "
"309090","309590"," Comments section."
"312550","313350"," Rotation trade."
"317130","320070"," It's a rotation trade, but it's not just rotation. "
"321710","323610"," We get a bunch of stuff to look at this morning."
"324070","324950"," A happy end of quarter."
"326290","331010"," Hopefully any of you that had calls on Thursday of last week held them all day long into the end"
"331010","337150"," of Friday. "
"337910","340690"," They did very, very well into the end of the day."
"342070","345410"," And then, of course, I'm sure that everybody was short at four fourteen."
"346370","347210"," Almost positive. "
"347870","350710"," We're going to talk about that around the open this morning and talk about that."
"351390","352170"," Just see y'all know."
"353670","355050"," So here, we'll start here. "
"359160","361800"," And just by just looking around the market itself."
"363580","364800"," What's a bunch of stuff to look at?"
"364800","373550"," The first big boy here is how irrational can the stock market stay as important to know."
"377170","379050"," By the way, I hope y'all had a great weekend. "
"379230","380190"," Hope y'all had a great quarter."
"380690","383210"," Hope none of you all got blown out."
"386620","388340"," Hope y'all made money this quarter. "
"390180","393120"," I don't know why this is all weird and wonky."
"393320","394120"," There it goes right there."
"394420","394880"," All right, here we go. "
"396100","397160"," So you can see it."
"400600","405080"," Well, how do these work in conjunction with themselves is important to know."
"407960","410240"," What makes this important down here?"
"410460","416280"," PPO, PMO, Brett in the market with some things to know. "
"417100","420340"," First big one is PPO were above."
"421520","429630"," We got buyers in the fucking market on breadth of the market."
"429630","435490"," Just want to show you this right here. "
"436690","440370"," You know, when we take up here, right, watch my cursor over here, we tick right here."
"440810","444010"," That's not, that's not all the fucking news ever."
"444510","447330"," It's very rare, not ever, but not the next day. "
"448630","452470"," Not only that, we typically ride it for a little bit."
"452570","453990"," You can see these ticks in here."
"454130","454850"," This is a daily chart. "
"455830","459410"," These are just sideways for days on a minimum."
"459410","469050"," And we typically actually, if you look right here, we have an entire like, we're"
"469050","471910"," going up, we're going up, we're going up, we're going up, we're going up, we're going up, we're"
"471910","476310"," going up, we're going up, we're actually buying dips for days on end."
"477130","478370"," That's the rotation trade. "
"479290","480750"," That's in every fucking dip gets bought."
"482010","486870"," And we're coming into the strongest month of the year after three years almost."
"488290","490250"," Three years of a bear market. "
"491370","495830"," We had the bear market actually started in December of 2020."
"496370","498690"," Anyone that was in spec growth knows that."
"501170","506750"," CNBC made a bunch of news stories where they told you to buy all these other arcade products that"
"506750","508210"," had more time on them. "
"508970","511950"," Well, in reality, what happened was January one came around."
"512090","514110"," They just started, they started rocking people."
"514929","517530"," People were just buying up January 20th. "
"517530","518450"," This was January 21."
"519890","521590"," And people just got to get clipped."
"522030","525330"," So I get clipped in like October, November, the signs were there. "
"525650","531520"," But then by, but then by January, it was on."
"531720","533680"," It was like, you're trapped, you're doomed, you're out of here."
"534960","536860"," So then we had, what, 2021?"
"538220","544180"," You know, 2020, we started hammering spec growth at some point in 2021 itself. "
"545240","546280"," Went after blue chips."
"547120","555020"," Well, they weren't covered by any kind of corporate debt bond security shit like that."
"555120","559100"," And then, of course, 2022, we finally went after those companies. "
"560260","562140"," So you got like two and a half to three years."
"562640","567420"," Now we're in the, now we're in the beginning middle of 2023."
"568280","569740"," You know, it's, it's April. "
"570860","573460"," We're in month four of 2023."
"573460","579020"," At some point, this, this market cycle is not going to wait."
"579100","581240"," The business cycle is not going to wait for you. "
"583540","585940"," To some extent, you get, you have to expect."
"587940","592640"," Some kind of a, you know, like we're going to move on with some things here."
"593300","597300"," You just can't, they're not going to, I think that you think that they are, but they're not. "
"597400","598660"," They're not going to wait for you three years."
"599380","603300"," Most of our bare cycles are one to three years and we're getting there."
"604500","608060"," You had Mike Wilson say, we're coming into the bottom. "
"608780","611220"," This was in, I believe February, March."
"611900","612600"," We're now in April."
"616100","618340"," We're not that far from all time highs. "
"619520","621680"," You can't stay short."
"623500","625800"," Up here and expect to just be there forever."
"626500","627900"," So it's not how our market works. "
"630160","635880"," Every once in a while, you get a bull run and people are whining about the S&P 500."
"636720","643200"," That was fucking shorted for weeks and days on end while the rest of the market went up."
"644480","646160"," And so that's what you're seeing happen right now. "
"646260","646740"," We're going higher."
"649930","651990"," And even, even NASDAQ doesn't look so bad."
"652290","655670"," Like for all the doom and gloom that I saw, I'm like, yeah, NASDAQ looks like it's kind of where"
"655670","656330"," it's going to get bought. "
"658050","663230"," You know, now you know that there are people out there that are like, Hey, cues."
"663490","664910"," This is where I put my shirt on and cues."
"665350","666710"," It works every single time. "
"667030","668090"," Cues never goes up."
"668230","669030"," That's not the case either."
"669030","670950"," I mean, it doesn't work. "
"671070","672010"," It doesn't work every time."
"672050","674750"," If I go back historically, the fucking cues go up."
"676190","679290"," So even that statement does kind of wonky to me. "
"680190","681610"," It's a regular thing, man."
"681770","682050"," Like, I agree."
"682210","683850"," It's a regular thing for right now. "
"684730","686110"," But your time is over."
"686290","692750"," Like if I'm running a clock and a calendar, the chances become more likely that you get run over on"
"692750","693190"," that trade."
"695920","697900"," So just starting out the new quarter. "
"699100","700560"," We're looking at a daily chart."
"700860","706400"," When we're up here with this overbought conditions, these can last for a period of time in the"
"706400","707160"," rotation trade."
"708340","712380"," And you're kind of looking to see other sectors that need to come up. "
"712380","718420"," So if money leaves tech, let's say we can rotate into other sectors."
"719140","722760"," And in some sectors, just specific tickers."
"722940","728740"," Last week on Thursday, we looked at sectors that had some tickers that have been going up did"
"728740","729220"," pretty well. "
"729740","731900"," And other tickers that didn't partake at all."
"732820","735840"," That were coming into cycle coming into the next."
"736820","738420"," Front running cycle, right?"
"741260","743400"," One of those biggest losers was oil. "
"744680","748940"," And we saw exactly what happened at the start of business on Q1."
"749580","751840"," We'll just rip some faces off like it was nothing."
"752720","755580"," And that was the biggest loser in Q1. "
"757500","759980"," And that is also a part of the S&P 500."
"762160","764860"," Now just looking at a weekly stance here."
"767340","769240"," It's looking pretty bullish down here, isn't it?"
"769560","770580"," This is a weekly now. "
"772340","774820"," This one's getting a little toppy right where you aren't even today."
"775040","776220"," This one's getting pretty toppy."
"776300","777200"," I don't like this one here. "
"777960","780620"," So we probably are going to top and come back down this week."
"781380","784220"," But this one right here and this one right here are extremely bullish."
"785140","787920"," These two right here are like, now we're going up, man. "
"788060","789320"," We could do a melt up here."
"790120","793240"," This is what PPO and PPMs are saying."
"794080","798540"," PMO and PMO and PPO are saying. "
"800360","807680"," Now I do look for some, so this is reminding me of previous April's where we dip and then they"
"807680","807940"," get spot."
"808220","809340"," We dip and then they get spot."
"809540","810400"," We dip and they get spot. "
"810580","812080"," It's like this crazy melt up."
"812620","814680"," Have you ever seen it or ever tried it through an April?"
"814840","815640"," You know what I'm talking about."
"818490","824010"," On a monthly, this is where the rage comes in right here. "
"824310","828090"," On a monthly, this is looking good too and here, isn't it?"
"830770","832850"," Just cranking, summer months, cranking."
"834110","835910"," This over here, a little bit over bot over here, right?"
"836330","837710"," This breath is a little rough right here."
"838430","840190"," I guess I can't even show you this one here. "
"841030","842750"," This one's not even showing up for the PMOs."
"843450","845090"," But just look at that beefiness right there."
"845910","847050"," Look at that beefiness. "
"847050","848870"," We're April 1 right now."
"848930","850770"," Look at this beast back here."
"851150","852790"," It's just got bought like just bought. "
"853870","855130"," They're probably not done."
"855770","858930"," They're probably going to take the summer off."
"862380","863880"," That's what I think they're going to do. "
"869660","871440"," Nice little take strike above here."
"872260","873380"," That's what I think that they do."
"875640","877420"," That's what it looks like at least to me. "
"883050","885150"," Then we get stuck trade in the summer."
"886590","888230"," Take a nap in the middle of the day."
"888410","889430"," In the middle of the daytime. "
"890810","892930"," This nice squeeze higher here."
"898310","901230"," I bet you there's a bunch of bears on Twitter right now."
"901350","904470"," They're like, alright, I just went short for the first time just now. "
"909610","911350"," It was flat all weekend."
"912250","918370"," Forget everything I said from Friday till until Sunday or Monday or overnight or whatever I said."
"920710","922670"," I was just short tassel. "
"922750","923170"," That was it."
"923370","923830"," Nothing else."
"928230","929270"," Oh shit. "
"942550","950120"," I'm not saying I'm going to take a look here."
"957040","959000"," So spies still trading off."
"959140","961680"," It's one and two minute or one in five minute. "
"963540","965280"," Five minutes getting weak right now."
"965320","966180"," One minute's getting weak."
"966440","966960"," This is weak. "
"967180","968020"," The one right here."
"968180","969300"," This one is weak right here."
"970200","980120"," And the hourly is starting to roll over and the daily is starting to roll over on the S&P"
"980120","980520"," 500. "
"980780","982340"," Let me take a look at the ES in the background here."
"994410","997630"," The ES still looks kind of strong in the hourly, believe it or not."
"997810","998590"," That sounds shocking. "
"1011040","1012520"," I'm going to get a nice roll here."
"1020150","1021610"," Here's the other thing too."
"1021730","1022870"," I've got to say something about this. "
"1024770","1026910"," Look at ES or spy."
"1027250","1027990"," It doesn't really matter."
"1029589","1031510"," There's still some stuff we want to know here. "
"1034630","1038270"," Well, first of all, the one minute's all fucked up on spy right now."
"1038329","1039170"," That's the five minute chart."
"1040670","1041670"," You get a nice little..."
"1042390","1043670"," There's something I want to show you. "
"1043790","1044890"," This is the one minute chart, right?"
"1046109","1047630"," But I want to show you something here."
"1047850","1049210"," To take like..."
"1052210","1053510"," Let me bring this over for you."
"1054910","1057650"," So the danger here is the same thing that I tell bulls. "
"1058450","1059930"," It's the exact same thing."
"1060170","1062410"," So this is the time for you to huddle around if you're a bear."
"1063690","1065510"," So if you're a bear, be honest with you. "
"1067310","1069270"," If you were a bear, okay?"
"1072880","1074140"," I want to show you this."
"1075860","1079700"," You know, this price is just trading the one in five minutes."
"1081020","1085460"," It has not given it up yet, and it has not shown a rejection. "
"1085800","1086500"," It did down here."
"1086560","1093200"," It was did a pretty good job down here where price traded below, or price traded below, but did not"
"1093200","1094580"," confirm the move lower, right?"
"1095200","1096160"," That proved false."
"1096540","1098220"," But it did trade down here. "
"1100560","1102660"," Price stayed below the one and the five."
"1102660","1104560"," The five minute was above."
"1107380","1115200"," But just as a bear, so if you were short last night or Friday, or fucking month, Sunday, or fucking"
"1115200","1119680"," right now, you really can't be. "
"1120340","1123260"," Trend is up on this S&P 500 right now."
"1123540","1127480"," Trend is up on price above the five minute right now."
"1127480","1135070"," And so it's very dangerous for a bear to attempt to short this. "
"1135730","1138730"," Any attempt to short this is being met with strength."
"1140110","1148990"," So the idea here is this, is that as a bear, you want to wait for price to confirm."
"1149670","1150270"," Confirm. "
"1150990","1151770"," You echo that again."
"1152610","1153650"," Huddle around if you're a bear."
"1156330","1158870"," Price needs to confirm underneath. "
"1160610","1163550"," I'm showing green bars here, but you get the picture."
"1163690","1165130"," I'm trying to do some contrast here."
"1165530","1171910"," You want to see price get underneath, come back up, and then confirm. "
"1174110","1181570"," So you're set up with the short right here, but you're not taking the short until we trade below"
"1181570","1181830"," it."
"1182810","1185370"," Confirm and then boom, now you're short right here."
"1186670","1187570"," Does that make sense?"
"1188630","1194370"," And that's how you take it with, like we can use semantics all we want on social media. "
"1195290","1200710"," But if you're, if you got real money on the line, like real fucking money, I pay my fucking bills."
"1202530","1204050"," I buy nice shit."
"1206090","1208170"," I don't have internet clout. "
"1208170","1216880"," I don't fucking, I don't fucking say I was short down here and I closed it perfectly."
"1218180","1220200"," Well, I guess you can say I'm still short here."
"1220280","1226000"," If you took this long, there's the second part of this trade, I guess, is where you're short, but"
"1226000","1228620"," you go long when it, when it rolls above the one minute. "
"1228740","1229040"," That works."
"1229960","1231400"," But most people don't do that."
"1231920","1232600"," Heads funds do that. "
"1232940","1233760"," Prop traders do that."
"1234080","1234980"," Smart traders do that."
"1235600","1236560"," But a lot of y'all don't. "
"1236660","1239660"," I know that most of you, 97% of you don't."
"1239660","1243340"," Whether you're long or short, take both sides of the trade."
"1244980","1247900"," That's why only 3% make money. "
"1250400","1253520"," So, my point here is the same even right now."
"1253700","1262230"," But where we are right now, being short here, it's a good short trade, quick, quick, quick, quick,"
"1262230","1262990"," good short trade."
"1263370","1263930"," Same as a bull. "
"1264150","1266690"," I'm like, hey, it's a five minute trade right here, a one minute trade right here."
"1266690","1272710"," But even so, you want to get underneath this because the real money is below it."
"1273350","1276630"," The real money is right here, right?"
"1277210","1279710"," This is 406.23 down here. "
"1280410","1284830"," The real money is the break below and then the trade lower."
"1285110","1287550"," And we set this up every day around here, right?"
"1288390","1289370"," I'll tell you all the time."
"1289530","1291650"," I'm like, you watch this happen here. "
"1292290","1295910"," You watch the one in five minute show you the way down."
"1295910","1301130"," And then you watch price confirm it."
"1301930","1304230"," So you don't need this bullshit in here. "
"1306700","1308020"," You don't need any of this."
"1312280","1315900"," What you need is price to confirm."
"1317160","1321880"," Like break below the five, confirm it and start to make its way down. "
"1322700","1325760"," And like right there is where you've got your short setup."
"1325980","1327360"," You've got your puts set up."
"1327860","1329140"," You got your stops above. "
"1330060","1339200"," And you've been given enough clues to at least take a trade that you have confidence in."
"1339320","1340880"," You're like, it hit this metric."
"1341020","1341800"," It hit that metric. "
"1341920","1342600"," It hit this metric."
"1342720","1343500"," It hit that metric."
"1344220","1346440"," Otherwise, you're just, I mean, otherwise we're going up. "
"1348940","1350840"," And price is telling you we're going up."
"1350960","1353160"," Even at this point, you need to see that cross."
"1356710","1359770"," And even then, once we get down here, it's the same thing. "
"1359770","1360630"," You cut profit."
"1360770","1361750"," You take the money and run."
"1363870","1364310"," Right?"
"1364550","1365870"," And then you wait for the rest of it. "
"1366050","1370150"," You wait for the one and the one and the five to get down here and roll over again for"
"1370150","1371550"," the next trade lower."
"1375370","1380010"," So if you're bear listening right now or watching right now, this is an important lesson, right?"
"1382010","1383670"," This is how you get fucking wrecked."
"1392000","1394740"," So even right here, right now, what are you waiting for?"
"1395380","1397600"," If you're a bear, you shouldn't even be short right now. "
"1397660","1399060"," You got no business being short here."
"1399700","1401720"," I mean, you can be short from like here to here."
"1402900","1405100"," You'd be like, yeah, it's a quick five minute trade down there. "
"1405220","1406540"," But even then, it's kind of risky, right?"
"1410070","1412870"," You want to see the development of the trade."
"1424650","1425610"," You want to see."
"1430920","1433060"," You know, a price rejection right here. "
"1433360","1437240"," Even if it's higher, let's say we get all up here, but it comes back down and rejects."
"1437240","1443200"," It gives you a little bit of a warning here."
"1444400","1445920"," And you can take this down. "
"1446200","1447160"," And this is where the money is."
"1447320","1453200"," This is where the if you run this trade, you run this trade like 10 times and you go back"
"1453200","1455420"," into your into your diary."
"1457000","1460600"," You're going to even if you take a let's say it squeeze, let's say you take the trade here and"
"1460600","1463720"," it goes back up against you, you at least have stops here. "
"1464620","1468400"," You take one cut on that trade, but you wait for this to play out."
"1469860","1473440"," You're overall going to have high win, high win rate."
"1474000","1478080"," You're going to have a not only high win rate, but you're going to have high percentage inside of"
"1478080","1482420"," those wins like I made 70% 100% 300% whatever it was. "
"1483920","1489240"," You could take two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine cuts and then hit the next nine"
"1489240","1494000"," perfectly and they're going to print you 80% 100% 300%."
"1494000","1497300"," You're just going to rock and make money at all times."
"1502160","1505000"," And just think you're like, I bought puts at the bell on Friday. "
"1505600","1510060"," You wake up on Monday and you're like, I took the money and ran right at the bell on on"
"1510060","1511000"," Monday."
"1511900","1512960"," What was that?"
"1513200","1513720"," 43 cents?"
"1513960","1514520"," I think we were down."
"1515020","1515500"," I think it was 43. "
"1515840","1516380"," Maybe it was a little bit more."
"1516740","1518180"," I wasn't paying attention in arrows."
"1518540","1520380"," I was doing some stuff with my kids. "
"1522360","1529240"," But, you know, like, even right now, this is not the trade for you as a bear."
"1529380","1530640"," You're waiting for this to develop."
"1531380","1533060"," And you may be like, like, I called it right cap. "
"1533700","1535160"," If I took it right here, cap."
"1536940","1538200"," What do you talk like that?"
"1538360","1542840"," If you run this trade 80 times, it's not going to if you do that 80 times, you're not going"
"1542840","1544420"," to, you're not going to be rich."
"1544420","1546900"," You're going to be broke in working a job. "
"1549720","1555960"," You want to take the easy trade that you know is going to print, that you know is going to"
"1555960","1556220"," pay."
"1557580","1558640"," That's what you're going to do."
"1559760","1562640"," That's what you have to do if you're going to be successful over time. "
"1563760","1564640"," You don't have a choice."
"1567660","1569640"," These don't win as they are."
"1569780","1573460"," This right here, as it is, they do not win if you took the short right here. "
"1574040","1576580"," People will tell you that they do, but they're lying to you."
"1576580","1577520"," I know they are."
"1580770","1583370"," I've shown you guys white papers where they don't. "
"1584790","1585810"," I've shown you a white paper."
"1585910","1587130"," You could read right through the entire thing."
"1589520","1592040"," If you run this trade over and over, you want to see the confirmation. "
"1592600","1594320"," You want to see the break below the five minute."
"1594920","1596020"," Then you want to see the rejection."
"1596620","1598840"," And you want to see this white line curl over here. "
"1600780","1601940"," You want some confirmation."
"1604140","1605560"," And we get a whole quarter ahead of us."
"1606800","1609580"," And if you only take the most select. "
"1611060","1611860"," Perfect shorts."
"1614960","1616280"," You should have no problems."
"1616840","1618440"," We're starting a new quarter is brand new quarter. "
"1620220","1621280"," You want to take them."
"1621340","1622780"," You want to take the finest shorts."
"1623020","1625300"," You want to take the finest longs. "
"1640680","1643400"," You don't need to be the rock star at all times."
"1644860","1646720"," You want to be, hey, I made money."
"1648180","1650100"," An Internet points don't count. "
"1650960","1652720"," They do on Internet, but that's all."
"1652860","1654160"," That's the only place that they count."
"1654620","1655940"," They don't count on anything else. "
"1656140","1657560"," You're the only person walking away going."
"1658100","1658960"," Here's my money."
"1659620","1661540"," And I got to do what I got to do with my money. "
"1668640","1669480"," No news."
"1670180","1670700"," No sentiment."
"1672880","1673760"," No TA. "
"1675400","1676240"," No fundamentals."
"1677520","1677900"," No nothing."
"1678300","1681700"," Only thing that matters is that you're starting to break down here. "
"1681700","1684200"," They'll be a rejection above and you'll take the short."
"1693220","1694720"," It's the only thing that matters."
"1716090","1718330"," Only the most select trades. "
"1720430","1748310"," Oh, yeah,"
"1748490","1748670"," baby."
"1761950","1763610"," Four nines are cheap."
"1765990","1768010"," Four and nine peas are real cheap. "
"1787150","1789090"," Go over some news for you here."
"1797350","1806480"," Bullard saying there was a rapid and appropriate response to bank turmoil."
"1807640","1811760"," He also said the Fed can continue with its monetary policy versus inflation. "
"1817480","1820920"," It's open question whether OPEC's move have long-term impact."
"1822240","1825540"," Fed needs rates above 5% and my forecast is the same."
"1825540","1826300"," It's higher than the median. "
"1827140","1829980"," Bullard needs to say it needs to be even higher at the sum."
"1830360","1832180"," So bearish on this stuff."
"1832340","1834220"," I'm like, you mean it needs to be at 7%. "
"1835020","1836800"," Maybe even seven and a half now."
"1838160","1839060"," Fed's blur decks."
"1839400","1840100"," It's funny too. "
"1840220","1841560"," Above 5%."
"1843240","1844120"," Try seven."
"1845360","1848780"," I expect inflation to be stickier and strong labor market. "
"1849220","1850900"," The labor market is not changing much."
"1851800","1852700"," It's all bullard."
"1852700","1855720"," The strong market provides the Fed with room to fight inflation. "
"1857740","1862180"," Bullard's also saying, you know, there we go."
"1862540","1863380"," Four nines, print."
"1865120","1866760"," Fed's blur also down below. "

"1872720","1874140"," We have another one right here. "
"1876200","1877720"," This is the opening tick here."
"1878420","1879800"," A couple targets down below for you."

"1951730","1954510"," That's a big one right on Wednesday ADP employment today, 15. "
"1955310","1957030"," You just heard what Bullard had to say."

"2006200","2007860"," There are only 84 cents right now."
"2009100","2009660"," Right in flat. "
"2020550","2022570"," Let's see if we can get another trade in on this."
"2030560","2032240"," Hopefully we can get this one right here."
"2066389","2067370"," A second here. "
"2148950","2150990"," McDonald's with a nice trade higher this morning."
"2158490","2160090"," Let's look at Tesla really quick."
"2160250","2161430"," I'm assuming people want to see Tesla. "
"2163710","2165730"," See if Tesla's in a buy or not."
"2169680","2174780"," Tesla coming down to its weekly right now and it's got to go down."

"2180820","2185300"," It's weekly at 195.15. Should see a bounce here."
"2206740","2208180"," Let's get Tesla real quick. "
"2222870","2225390"," You can see no quarter given to Tesla, right?"
"2225630","2227230"," We had the buyers step in above."
"2228590","2230830"," This is the original push up, right?"
"2231910","2232930"," Sellers stepped in."
"2232990","2234050"," Sellers stepped in. "
"2234770","2236610"," Sellers stepping in early this time."
"2236630","2238690"," You can see where the all these shorts are here."
"2240290","2243770"," All Tesla's in my view so far, unless something changes. "
"2244350","2252440"," Even with all these shorts above here trying to step in these sellers, right?"
"2253640","2256080"," You still have demand down below."
"2256580","2257680"," You still have demand here."
"2262000","2264040"," And trend is still up for Tesla. "
"2265980","2267980"," Here, this is daily trend here."

"2278980","2281300"," probably going to be a pretty decent one for you to look at. "
"2281760","2282920"," Pretty decent ticker."
"2283080","2284120"," We'll look at Nvidia."

"2321350","2321730"," on tech. "

"2489720","2518260"," Trade right on it's five minute right here, 409.01. Go"
"2518260","2527880"," back to the one minute where your sellers"
"2527880","2528660"," are right here. "
"2551750","2553750"," Check that five minute you have to adjust these."
"2559230","2560530"," That looks fairly good."
"2606190","2607810"," Someone said I don't think bear town. "
"2608070","2618480"," One problem down here is where do they start buying the dip for that"
"2618480","2619360"," rotation trade?"
"2620560","2622500"," Does the market actually start bloodbath and rolling?"
"2627930","2630450"," Look at it Apple, it's still fucking bullish."
"2632310","2639310"," Still, like Apple's bullish above 163.20. Like you need a break of 160."
"2639670","2643530"," Like at this moment, you need a break of 160.20 confirmation underneath it. "
"2643910","2647510"," Then we start really fucking selling to the market like bloodbath."
"2651160","2661480"," Coming right back into the opening price of the spy this morning, trading 408.98. Let's"
"2661480","2662260"," look at Apple real quick."
"2668390","2669470"," Let me just look at this. "
"2670030","2671430"," It's kind of disgusting right?"
"2671630","2672730"," If you're a bear, you got to be pissed."
"2680500","2681940"," Like where's the meat of the trade?"
"2682140","2682600"," It's right here."
"2683120","2685220"," Like it needs to break. "
"2686260","2688260"," I mean it needs to break."
"2690040","2697760"," 160.318. Otherwise it's like buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip."
"2697760","2699480"," We haven't even, Apple hasn't even broken. "
"2699480","2701260"," It's one in five in reality."
"2702260","2703920"," Look at it's just starting to break it."
"2704900","2705680"," But has it really?"
"2707900","2708960"," Look at it. "
"2709420","2710580"," It's gross and disgusting."
"2710580","2714120"," Now there's a good point to be made here."
"2714860","2717080"," Let's get a one minute on Apple here. "
"2717740","2719600"," There is some good signs here."
"2725490","2727230"," We can get a cross here, right?"
"2727430","2730450"," Spend some time down here and confirm the move lower."
"2733820","2740150"," So you're wanting to see here in Apple is you want to see that crossover. "
"2740670","2741830"," This is a one minute chart in Apple."
"2744530","2747230"," And you want to see like price reject."
"2747230","2752970"," You want like a big fat like I guess that's you want this green bar and then you want like"
"2752970","2755710"," a big fat red bar so you can chase it down. "
"2757350","2760070"," And that's where like a major move down is for Apple."
"2761210","2763530"," It's starting to see that red bar develop right now."
"2764570","2774220"," You could put a short on here and have a stop above at 164.98. That's a"
"2774220","2776020"," fat trade right there. "
"2779360","2780860"," And that trade is good too."
"2781360","2783080"," Well, you've got some road bumps here."
"2783240","2791900"," You've got 163.92 to pay attention to in 163.77. But even then if we sell down here, it's"
"2791900","2798820"," just another opportunity for these fucking bulls, me, personally to buy it to make it run up again. "
"2799080","2800020"," And that's just the hourly."
"2800200","2801720"," We're not even talking about the daily yet."
"2802610","2805040"," You could break the hourly. "
"2805500","2807200"," The juicier target is even lower."
"2808980","2817960"," Talking 156.06. That's where you see like an 800 point down move in the"
"2817960","2820060"," market."
"2823000","2824640"," A nice fat target down there 156. "
"2832230","2835030"," But otherwise even right now we're over all bullish."
"2835290","2835690"," Isn't that crazy?"
"2836210","2836870"," We're bullish here."
"2839890","2840370"," It's insane. "
"2840810","2859440"," Now you see"
"2859440","2860720"," that for two, three days."
"2861000","2861800"," You could see it for a week."
"2865910","2868090"," And what you want is you want to see blood, right?"
"2869450","2874770"," So if you're going to take a put spread or something like that, we talk about putting on. "
"2876530","2881050"," I think last week on Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, leading into the end of the"
"2881050","2884070"," weekend, saying to you, you start with put spreads."
"2886130","2888750"," That can take a beating for a week or two."
"2889810","2893770"," And then you get more aggressive every time you hit on a high, you can get it more aggressive. "
"2895850","2899830"," And then as time passes, depending upon more prices, you can get more violence."
"2899830","2908010"," You can move into full on shorts, full on, full on zero to eight puts and all that kind of"
"2908010","2909990"," stuff and start making heavy money on the downside."
"2923330","2925570"," So take opening price down here. "
"2925650","2930830"," Now looking to close the over or let the over at the pre market lows down here."
"2931270","2934950"," I want to take out 408.37 and we got the gap down below here."
"2935670","2937910"," It's at 408.25 or so. "
"2965510","2967870"," To put the triggers up for you right now, hold on a second."
"2978980","2980240"," So you can see where they are."
"2995760","3000570"," 40648 to be a nice target for down below. "
"3011040","3013780"," Hold on a second, I got to make those back, bring those back here."
"3023500","3024800"," For a 648."
"3076740","3077260"," 39878. "
"3088320","3089720"," Another target lower."
"3092160","3094500"," This is the one that I hope we can get to on the spy."
"3125120","3127100"," Another nice gap down here to fill. "
"3128880","3129420"," 40365."
"3188760","3190220"," Keep an eye on the markets."
"3190540","3195020"," The S&P continuing it's slide from about 10 30 am Eastern time. "
"3195400","3201560"," The only headline to back this move is the IE, a plus cut risk worsening inflationary pressures."
"3202280","3206220"," Other than that, there isn't anything else we can see to back that up."
"3208140","3209400"," I don't know. "
"3209460","3211280"," Maybe the fact that we traded all the way up here."
"3212340","3213380"," That's enough for me."
"3214980","3217080"," Tag our one like it was nobody's business. "
"3217420","3224500"," Get a bunch of shit to clean up down here."
"3227000","3228260"," Overbought on the daily."
"3231060","3232480"," We actually are overbought. "
"3232780","3235940"," So that open, we were overbought on the weekly on that open."
"3241300","3244540"," The opening the opening hour was even an hour."
"3244640","3245260"," I think it took an hour. "
"3245520","3246980"," I think it took a half an hour for us."
"3247240","3250040"," I think it took a half an hour for us to be overbought on the weekly."
"3256600","3258460"," I don't think we needed any more news. "
"3264520","3265900"," Another little gap down here."
"3265980","3269040"," Tiny little gap down here at 40825."
"3269540","3273120"," And then a pre market pre market has still not been tagged. "
"3273780","3275340"," And see that stuff right in here."
"3277060","3281580"," We still have not given up the squeeze into the bell on Friday here yet."
"3282120","3284900"," So this whole gap right here, none of this has been given up yet. "
"3287360","3288900"," So we should get down there at least."
"3289180","3290740"," I don't think we're done going down right now."
"3292180","3294280"," Really clean all this mess up right here. "
"3302220","3306180"," Bed bids for six month bills, total five spots, six billion dollars."
"3306420","3310160"," And fed bids for three month bills, total six, but six billion dollars."
"3316730","3322710"," If you're as we don't think the OPEC production cuts advisable given the market uncertainty and we"
"3322710","3324070"," made that clear to OPEC. "
"3327800","3333560"," You should see VIX be able to get to at least 21 11 today right now."
"3334460","3337860"," 19 and change almost 20 almost 20 bucks."
"3339140","3346400"," Should be able to get to at least 21, if not even possibly 21 96 ish somewhere in there and"
"3346400","3352900"," then there's some more resistance above at 23 39 with producers and consumers to ensure growth and"
"3352900","3354420"," lower prices for consumers. "
"3370930","3373370"," 1115 got a nice new low down here."
"3373370","3374150"," This is really nice."
"3375550","3379870"," Come back and check this one minute here and we'll check this this five minute as well. "
"3402060","3404080"," See if they can jump back in on this trade with you."
"3436550","3439010"," Tesla catching a bounce on its weekly trigger right now."
"3470640","3474140"," I don't know if I should jump in right now or wait just a few minutes about to jump in,"
"3474140","3477400"," but should get a swift reversal here coming up in just a moment. "
"3480400","3481460"," Still a little too pricey."
"3503850","3505590"," Now I'm watching these 408's."
"3544050","3547070"," See what you guys are saying and I didn't have the chat set up. "
"3547290","3549150"," Let me check up this chat here."
"3571690","3573010"," The White House says we have..."
"3573010","3573530"," Hey good morning, Winky."
"3573710","3574090"," How are you brother?"
"3574250","3575550"," We are not focused on barrels. "
"3576410","3577270"," I see you're in the chat, bro."
"3578330","3580730"," And the White House says it's the Saudi Arabia."
"3580730","3581890"," He was in here this morning. "
"3582070","3597220"," I was going"
"3597220","3597520"," to..."
"3597520","3599060"," Someone said something about bleeding tweets."
"3599420","3602900"," I was going to delete everything with Saudi, but we remain partners."
"3604000","3610560"," And at 11 30 a.m. Eastern time, the US sells $57 billion in three month bills, private cover of"
"3610560","3614340"," two to 51 and a prior high yield of four spots, six, seven, five percent. "
"3614340","3620860"," And the US sells $48 billion in six month bills, private cover of two to 85 and a prior high"
"3620860","3622660"," yield of four spots, six, five percent."
"3631610","3634510"," Someone asked about someone I'm sent to it deleting tweets."
"3635550","3638990"," I'll be honest, I don't have any problems with people deleting tweets. "
"3640010","3643530"," I used to when I first became a fan Twitter, I used to have a problem with it."
"3644690","3648370"," As long as you do it on a regular basis, I'm fine with it."
"3650830","3655210"," As a matter of fact, I was just discussing with somebody of deleting all..."
"3655210","3656870"," I'll tell you, I'll explain this in a moment. "
"3657070","3657870"," Anyways, deleting tweets."
"3659150","3661790"," I don't like when people leave..."
"3661790","3664090"," Well, let me start at the beginning."
"3664570","3669190"," So my history, I typically delete tweets if I really piss somebody off. "
"3669390","3672870"," Like I hurt someone's feelings and didn't know it really badly."
"3673670","3676470"," I don't know, something happened to their kid and I said something."
"3676670","3678450"," Sometimes I've done that. "
"3678670","3683230"," Or I'll make a joke or something and I'm trying to do it in a nice way and it comes"
"3683230","3685710"," off as being really fucking harsh."
"3686070","3690010"," And I'm like, shit, I gotta delete that because I really hurt somebody's feelings."
"3691090","3693970"," Sometimes I've deleted not many tweets, but the ones that I have. "
"3694230","3696610"," Or I've gotten something supremely wrong."
"3697490","3699850"," I fucked this data point up."
"3700390","3702490"," Not like I was wrong in a call or something like that. "
"3702490","3704350"," I leave all those up whether they're right or wrong."
"3707190","3708430"," Usually it's that kind of stuff."
"3708610","3709530"," I've also deleted tweets. "
"3709830","3714270"," I'll tweet my pictures of my wife and kids and stuff like that for you guys to see."
"3714550","3718850"," I've also in the past posted some of my trade stuff."
"3719830","3720510"," Like real. "
"3720850","3726270"," Not like I made up some bullshit and cut and paste it and post it on Twitter or something."
"3727010","3730490"," Like after the fact where you take both sides of the trade, paper trade and then you show that"
"3730490","3730710"," shit."
"3731270","3733290"," But like, here's my bona fide that kind of stuff. "
"3733550","3736810"," It's like stuff that's like you don't want people seeing forever and ever."
"3737810","3739570"," But other than that, I don't delete shit, right?"
"3740030","3741050"," Some people do that, right?"
"3741210","3745290"," They delete when they get a call wrong or something."
"3745750","3746970"," Or I don't know. "
"3747090","3748010"," You're just so fucking bullish."
"3748330","3749390"," You're so fucking bearish."
"3749970","3751250"," And you're like wrong all the time. "
"3751330","3751790"," You feel bad."
"3752350","3753410"," It's like he gets to whatever."
"3753790","3755010"," I actually don't have a problem with that either. "
"3756230","3760750"," But some people clean up their their account like just time passes."
"3761630","3763050"," And they want to clean it up."
"3763390","3767070"," I understand that some people do it because they don't want their history out there. "
"3767530","3768830"," You know, some people get pissed off."
"3768890","3770210"," They're like, Hey, why did you delete your tweets?"
"3771250","3772430"," There's a reason for it."
"3772870","3775350"," People want to maintain their fucking privacy. "
"3778050","3779510"," For for good reason."
"3779510","3781090"," You know, I was just watching a video."
"3782850","3789190"," I was on Reddit a week or two ago and some fucking gamer got swatted. "
"3789990","3792750"," You know, those those please come to your house and they want to shoot you."
"3795210","3796390"," Then you have people out there."
"3796510","3797730"," They're professional traders. "
"3798410","3801890"," They don't want their fucking history out there for the whole world to see."
"3801990","3803630"," You're lucky that you get what they give you."
"3804530","3809370"," There seems to be some kind of like my shit has to be out there for you to fucking inspect. "
"3810190","3813670"," Twenty four hours of fucking day every week on end year over year."
"3814050","3817150"," And that the truth is they don't know you shit."
"3817970","3820230"," So if you see somebody out there that deletes their tweets. "
"3821630","3823050"," I've got no problem with it."
"3824110","3825830"," They don't you know, they don't know you shit."
"3826330","3830310"," You know, so you can't really blame anybody for deleting their tweets. "
"3830530","3831730"," Some people just like to keep their shit clean."
"3832270","3836130"," Some people are very methodical because in their real life, they're very clean people."
"3836130","3838050"," House is clean cars clean. "
"3838910","3842090"," They write nice cursive that that's what they're about, right?"
"3842510","3846410"," And so what are they going to leave some sloppy Twitter handle out there just because you want it."
"3846850","3847870"," The answer is no."
"3849690","3851390"," So there's like that stuff too. "
"3852350","3855810"," And if you're blaming somebody out there for deleting tweets because they always get the calls"
"3855810","3856110"," wrong."
"3856670","3857790"," That's not a big deal either."
"3859450","3860370"," What do you care?"
"3861030","3862670"," If you don't like them, you don't follow them. "
"3862770","3863350"," You don't like them."
"3863350","3863890"," You turn them off."
"3866770","3868610"," You got nothing that they owe you. "
"3868770","3872950"," I guess is the point behind that says we have every intention to rebuild the strategic oil."
"3872970","3878150"," And as a matter of fact, I was thinking of delete."
"3878370","3880890"," So leading into I don't normally delete tweets. "
"3881090","3883370"," I got like 20,000 fucking tweets or something out there."
"3884030","3889570"," So I was thinking about deleting tweets on my on the captain Jim James handle mostly with that"
"3889570","3892450"," mostly 100% because I was going to change the format."
"3893430","3894710"," Of my handle. "
"3895130","3896810"," And what gets posted there."
"3897630","3900470"," We've been talking about this for a few months now where."
"3901870","3903370"," I was going to shift the format. "
"3903370","3905450"," So I'm not captain Zalfa and Jim James."
"3905930","3907190"," They get a problem with Jim Jamie."
"3907390","3912470"," All these numbers and a prior high yield of four spots, six, seven, five percent in the U.S. cells,"
"3912750","3918370"," 48 billion dollars in six month bills, private cover of two to 85 and a prior high yield of four"
"3918370","3919590"," spots, six, five percent. "
"3921310","3923630"," I have all these numbers after my name."
"3923830","3926890"," It's like at Jim James, not James, not captain Jim James."
"3927470","3933490"," So right now we're trying to work on changing my handle without changing my like making it simpler. "
"3934730","3939970"," Like, I don't know, Jim, James stock market show or something like that that fits."
"3939970","3948250"," So it's not as easy to make a fake account, like a bot or someone selling telegram bullshit or"
"3948250","3948650"," whatever."
"3950330","3951570"," So I have my own reasons. "
"3951850","3955810"," I'm trying to do this and I'm trying to change the format to what I actually post on that handle."
"3957770","3962370"," And then the captain James, our captain Zalfa and then."
"3963190","3965250"," I think I actually have two other handles. "
"3965250","3967130"," One of them you don't know about."
"3968270","3970450"," And that's the disseminate information for the new website."
"3972470","3974770"," So it's just more of just shifting and stuff for myself. "
"3975050","3976130"," But other people do it for their own reasons."
"3976550","3977630"," Everybody normally has a reason."
"3977790","3984170"," They really don't owe you a reason why or what or what they're trying to accomplish on their on"
"3984170","3985330"," their Twitter handles my point. "
"3988010","3991070"," It's a good question because it's discussed all the time."
"3991070","3995890"," Matter of fact, I saw a poor slumber fat made something made a comment yesterday that I found"
"3995890","3998010"," really great and slightly said something about."
"3998810","4000410"," Post and good bad trades. "
"4000850","4002690"," People have a lot of balls for doing that."
"4003030","4004490"," I agree with that 100%."
"4004490","4009270"," And I made a comment on I made a comment on Friday or something about tracking. "
"4010250","4016490"," People that call trades or call like, Hey, is this embarrassed or I'm bullish or whatever."
"4017050","4022970"," And oftentimes it's not or when you want something like that is when you get some."
"4023190","4025290"," So you I don't know what the name of the website is. "
"4025330","4034150"," There's a website where license professionals make calls like that make actual calls where the"
"4034150","4035190"," market's going to fucking burn."
"4035930","4041490"," The market's going to fucking go up and you can track how correct they are."
"4041490","4045010"," And they're ranked with a score like, Hey, this guy does it right. "
"4045190","4045770"," This guy does wrong."
"4045890","4048910"," And you kind of want that if you're following people want to know."
"4049710","4055370"," Are they just sometimes it's easy and clear to find out who's who's shit posting. "
"4055770","4056410"," Yeah, it's funny."
"4056510","4058950"," Last week I ran this whole thing where I was like, let's see."
"4059690","4062470"," I was like, let's see what people's perceptions are of. "
"4063830","4064350"," What's real?"
"4064590","4064910"," What's fake?"
"4066310","4068250"," What is a shit post?"
"4068570","4069610"," What's not a shit post?"
"4070790","4071910"," Can people decipher."
"4072810","4076350"," What people mean on fin to it and also let's find out what gets more traction."
"4076970","4082970"," If we're at a lower a higher if we're set good doing like contra posts that get more traction than"
"4082970","4084210"," other posts. "
"4084710","4089510"," All kinds of all kinds of questions where you like posting things to find out if they're being"
"4089510","4095750"," decelerated or accelerated for people to see the reasons why those things happen."
"4098250","4100569"," So, Elon has this whole thing where he's like power user."
"4101189","4103390"," You make tons and tons and tons and tons of posts. "
"4103630","4104250"," You're a power user."
"4105109","4109810"," So there's there's all these different algorithms and algorithms that decide if you get followers."
"4110970","4112870"," If people leave, stop following you. "
"4112970","4118370"," As a matter of fact, I made one post last week where I found people that were raging over it."
"4119170","4123069"," And they were like calling my name out and then I went to their handles and I found that they"
"4123069","4124470"," were calling out other people."
"4126689","4130210"," Like like a rage rage posting on specific handles. "
"4130830","4135529"," And what some of these people don't realize is that when you're doing that, you're actually gaining"
"4135529","4137170"," followers for those people."
"4137170","4139290"," Three month and six month field of auction."
"4139550","4142170"," I will lead with the three month pitch cover ratio. "
"4143029","4147990"," So there's like a follower harvesting that goes on and then there's follower harvesting on what"
"4147990","4148649"," you're posting."
"4149590","4154750"," Things that piss people off that when you have made getting emotional response from somebody, if"
"4154750","4155990"," you're a fin Twitter, if you're on Twitter."
"4156609","4160410"," And you're getting an emotional response from what you see posted. "
"4161670","4165810"," Mostly there is intent to piss you off."
"4166830","4176130"," Not only to piss you off, but to turn you into a free advertising source for people to follow that"
"4176130","4177330"," person you're pissed off at."
"4177330","4179390"," And I think that he'll don't realize that. "
"4179569","4181970"," They're like, well, you're rage tweeting about this account."
"4182630","4189370"," But what you're going to do is actually promote that account for people to find that person and"
"4189370","4191750"," then follow them so that you can then rage."
"4192430","4195630"," And then you're like, why does that person have 300,000 followers?"
"4196270","4196970"," That's the reason. "
"4198810","4200410"," Which is kind of crazy, right?"
"4201270","4205410"," You think that you're so you think you're like, you know, I'm going to go after that person that I"
"4205410","4206250"," hate on Fintuit."
"4207170","4209450"," And I'm going to rage post about them."
"4209910","4213070"," But what you don't realize is that you're actually helping that person. "
"4214550","4220390"," Where if you just ignored them, you wouldn't help them to gain followers."
"4220390","4222510"," So you understand the concept here."
"4222790","4227750"," You're actually helping someone gain followers and traction when you piss them off. "
"4228610","4235710"," So when you're pissed off and you directly or indirectly talk about them, you're actually gaining"
"4235710","4237550"," them fucking followers, which is insane."
"4237830","4242910"," My point here is if someone pisses you off, right, you mute them or block them."
"4243310","4244710"," You don't want them to know you just mute them. "
"4245050","4248570"," I guess you can find out if somebody's muted you, but you just mute them and you don't follow them"
"4248570","4248970"," any longer."
"4249270","4250650"," If someone's actually making you angry."
"4251590","4252430"," Does that make sense?"
"4257970","4261270"," I know that sounds absurd, but it's real and true. "
"4263670","4266610"," So anyways, with all that stuff out of the way."
"4269070","4269690"," You're."
"4270730","4272430"," My point here is. "
"4278120","4286980"," Yeah, I"
"4286980","4290040"," don't."
"4290040","4290760"," We should track people."
"4291140","4291700"," It's voluntary. "
"4292980","4298400"," So if you're a person out there, if you're if you're a fin Twitter, this isn't like mandatory, like"
"4298400","4301560"," we're going to track everybody and come hunt them down."
"4301700","4307200"," Hey, if I'm going to make a post on fin to it, and I want to track myself to establish"
"4307200","4308360"," a record of."
"4309320","4310100"," Hey, I'm long here. "
"4310280","4310880"," I'm short here."
"4311060","4311280"," I'm long."
"4311580","4313220"," I closed or hey, I got fucked up. "
"4313720","4314840"," Hey, I don't know."
"4315740","4317020"," I'm short all the way down here."
"4317120","4317820"," I closed the short. "
"4318100","4318960"," Now I'm long right here."
"4319060","4321120"," I'm closing the long and short long right here."
"4321400","4324900"," Even if you close it, if you're like one of those people, you could always say to yourself, this"
"4324900","4326120"," isn't like talking battle people. "
"4326140","4326780"," It's more of."
"4327260","4331200"," Hey, I want to track my my W's and L's on fin to it and you can check them out"
"4331200","4331620"," over here."
"4332000","4332740"," Does that make sense?"
"4333740","4336740"," So it's a way for you to show people. "
"4336920","4340240"," Hey, man, you can just go check my history and every one of my posts where I'm long or short."
"4340820","4342680"," I put this at symbol."
"4343020","4344480"," There's a thin Twitter's out there. "
"4344580","4345600"," They can track this stuff for you."
"4346160","4348160"," And what you can do is actually have a record of it."
"4348240","4350960"," So people were asking you can be like, well, yeah, I do it through this. "
"4351540","4352260"," This Twitter."
"4353520","4358760"," This Twitter robot or AI bot that you can you can be followed."
"4358760","4359540"," They can follow you. "
"4360160","4361740"," And you can do it just for those calls."
"4361740","4366840"," So we just repeat that they're three month high yield four spot 78 cent four spot 78 cent."
"4367320","4370200"," You know, I have the luxury of live streaming every day. "
"4370400","4372840"," So it's easy for me to be like, yeah, I do it every fucking day."
"4374020","4378200"," I get the I get the robot going all day long, but a lot of people don't have that, right?"
"4378400","4381960"," So if they want that six months, it's there for you to use."
"4382140","4382960"," It's a tool for you. "
"4382960","4387520"," It's high yield four spot seven zero five percent four spot seven zero five percent."
"4391790","4397510"," Us sells 54 billion dollars in six month bills and awards 80 spot eight percent of bids at high."
"4398130","4401590"," A little bit of reversal here. "
"4404770","4406670"," I'm watching a vix in the background here."
"4409210","4409970"," Vix coming down."
"4410050","4410450"," I'll show you guys. "
"4410570","4411030"," Vix real quick."
"4424900","4425740"," So I can look."
"4425880","4428360"," We look really bullish on spy right now, but the victim. "
"4428520","4429440"," No, just come back into it."
"4429540","4429640"," Sorry."
"4431760","4432120"," Right. "
"4432260","4433820"," Just watching the big or I'll change this."
"4437790","4438930"," Being patient here."
"4439710","4441430"," Watch the Vix squeeze up higher, right?"
"4441690","4443610"," Comes back down, coming back down right now. "
"4443690","4447010"," I want to see Vix kind of just fuck around here and hopefully get higher again."
"4447670","4448490"," We get another move lower."
"4448750","4453110"," I don't want to see the Vix break below 19 and some change here. "
"4458760","4460080"," So just inside of here."
"4473120","4474800"," We start bouncing around here."
"4474940","4476820"," I want to see Vix start take off again. "
"4477620","4479600"," So you can take that next that next move down."
"4480280","4482240"," If the trade is over, we can take a long up here."
"4484920","4487240"," I don't like know this stuff was cleaned up back here. "
"4490430","4492350"," You know, all this kind of nonsense back here."
"4492470","4492850"," All needs clean."
"4493010","4494790"," Well, at least this shit down here needs cleaned up. "
"4495310","4497530"," We haven't even started talking about this stuff down here."
"4517340","4517700"," 1931."
"4522610","4524410"," Hoping this is a bull trap right here. "
"4526130","4533420"," I was looking at 408 P's."
"4533620","4535360"," They're down at 40 cents right now."
"4535880","4537500"," They're at 50 a minute ago. "
"4537940","4540920"," 409 P's are back down to 75 cents again."
"4541160","4543180"," They were low at a low earlier."
"4544340","4554220"," So when I look back on 409 P's again, one thing that I don't like is that there's a 209 "
"4554220","4554860",",000. "
"4557540","4560220"," 109,000 puts right now at 409."
"4561520","4568780"," I wish that so I wish there was like."
"4569840","4574100"," 300,000 405 P's like that's what I wish. "
"4574980","4577840"," Because I know when we can go lower, you know what I mean?"
"4578640","4580560"," And not seeing those."
"4586430","4587970"," I want to see him like farther."
"4588430","4591190"," I want to see it so that we can go down here and not be in the money. "
"4593350","4594110"," Makes sense."
"4595070","4600650"," Like seeing puts in the money right now, not making me supremely bearish here."
"4617820","4619980"," Whatever I see like in the money put buying. "
"4621020","4622920"," It's the same as in the money call buying."
"4623100","4625960"," If I see in the money call buying, I'm not like super bullish."
"4626580","4630980"," If I see like super if I see like OTM call buying and zero dates. "
"4631620","4632440"," Two, three strikes."
"4632520","4633640"," I'm like, yeah, we can go up here."
"4634860","4640060"," But I see OTM or when I see ITM put buying, I'm like, yeah, even if we go down, we're"
"4640060","4641140"," fucking coming back up. "
"4641680","4643920"," I'm not going to close these fucking puts in the money."
"4661560","4663320"," Let's check the five minute really quick here."
"4667780","4669760"," Fucking dip buying bulls, baby. "
"4669960","4672420"," Boom, boom, boom, buy it again."
"4673120","4674820"," He's fucking bulls, man."
"4676060","4676660"," Relentless. "
"4677740","4680340"," So far looking like that melt up shit, isn't it?"
"4681160","4684200"," Looking like that melt up every dip will be bought."
"4687940","4690040"," We will buy every dip."
"4691980","4696190"," Then we'll take the summer off. "
"4704810","4706850"," We'll just put Max Payne on bears."
"4708170","4711870"," If I was a bear, probably put some put spreads on."
"4712050","4715450"," Just close your notebook, your laptop and come back in two weeks. "
"4716210","4716650"," Go to your bunker."
"4718010","4718610"," Three weeks."
"4720910","4722970"," Set some triggers below. "
"4723590","4747770"," It was up"
"4747770","4748510"," late last night."
"4748630","4751330"," I spent last night working on my boat."
"4751730","4753270"," Well spent yesterday in the boat. "
"4753450","4754330"," Then last night on my."
"4756570","4758670"," I've got a small."
"4759950","4764730"," I've got a small off road pop up camper. "
"4766430","4767670"," When I use it to."
"4768850","4770030"," It's like a base camp."
"4770030","4772530"," I go on these week long trips. "
"4773930","4775970"," Then I kind of go to places where no one goes."
"4776450","4777210"," I got wife and kids."
"4777570","4779510"," So there's no hotels usually wherever I go. "
"4781610","4791610"," And I"
"4791610","4793890"," was getting it ready for the spring and summer."
"4795090","4798110"," So you every year you got to do this maintenance bullshit on it."
"4798230","4798990"," Repack bearings. "
"4802930","4806450"," Like ripped canvas whole small holes and canvas."
"4807630","4810790"," Any water intrusions parts you want to replace that kind of shit."
"4811350","4813310"," So late last night I was working on that. "
"4816720","4817300"," And."
"4818580","4821620"," You know like all these systems they put in these things."
"4823580","4826360"," They're like they're like cars like. "
"4826980","4828240"," They work okay."
"4829660","4833640"," But they're usually loaded and they're usually."
"4834340","4837420"," I don't know like old. "
"4839540","4842620"," Usually like aftermarket stuff will do a better job."
"4843180","4843520"," And so."
"4844280","4848560"," I was talking to a buddy last night late night and I'm like yeah I'm talking about water. "
"4848800","4851440"," I'm like this is this holds true for boats too."
"4853100","4854300"," Like here you're like."
"4854300","4856800"," Like filtering from the source. "
"4857320","4861040"," Then you're trying to fight things growing in your holding tanks."
"4861460","4861960"," Then you're."
"4862940","4864900"," Faucet that you're trying to get it from then. "
"4865740","4866600"," There are the."
"4867120","4868580"," The electrical components."
"4869360","4873860"," Like is it a pump for let's just talk waters a pump or is it. "
"4874620","4876520"," An electrical pump is it."
"4877060","4880960"," DC is it can be DC and AC can be all these different things."
"4881420","4885800"," And then what what ends up happening for most most of the time this is water for me specifically. "
"4887040","4891580"," I'm like yeah I just ended up filling up a couple five gallon jugs of filtered pre or."
"4892120","4892680"," Filtered water."
"4892960","4896500"," I know the jugs cleaned out washed out and I take it with me and that's what we drink. "
"4897300","4897720"," And."
"4898020","4899740"," I don't even need these."
"4899940","4900980"," I don't even need these tanks. "
"4901700","4902580"," They just take up space."
"4903640","4906680"," And then I got a sink inside of this thing that's too small to do dishes."
"4906680","4910880"," I don't ever do any dishes inside as it is. "
"4910960","4913320"," I'm like that's just taking a bunch of space weight space."
"4915800","4917240"," It doesn't work for what I use."
"4917400","4920620"," I guess if I had an RV or something like a big 30 foot. "
"4921480","4922760"," I used to have a driving RV."
"4923220","4927640"," I used to take on long hike and bike and trips and stuff and that was cool to have all"
"4927640","4928020"," those things."
"4928360","4930500"," But this thing is more like a glorified tent. "
"4931120","4933420"," They bring out the middle of nowhere and I get to load up a bunch of shit."
"4934240","4936480"," And so I'm making a decision yesterday."
"4936780","4938100"," I'm like I'm going to rip bunch of this shit out. "
"4938420","4941420"," And then I was going to rip like all the electrical stuff and the gas stuff."
"4943060","4944860"," None of it is stuff that I really need."
"4945040","4946700"," And then the converter is kind of janky. "
"4946960","4948420"," Like they're all old school converters."
"4952840","4953720"," I don't know."
"4954160","4957440"," It all takes up too much space and I'm like I want to get rid of all this shit and"
"4957440","4958360"," get more space inside. "
"4970280","4972500"," So I'm in there yesterday just ripping shit apart."
"4972600","4973480"," I'm like this is out."
"4973720","4974280"," This is out. "
"4974680","4975520"," This is out."
"4975520","4980100"," If any of you guys sail or anything or camp or backpack or any of that kind of shit."
"4980860","4982120"," I'm like I don't want to rip out. "
"4982160","4985800"," I don't want to bring out a tube and dump like human waste into a sewer."
"4986080","4988480"," And that's clean the tube out and shit or breaks."
"4988800","4990380"," And I'm like I just want to use some. "

"4996660","5001280"," Some like hamster pie and shavings or something or sawdust shavings."
"5002220","5005060"," You know it never breaks if it never never fails. "
"5008500","5011480"," It's simple doesn't smell and it's like in and out."
"5013300","5015220"," Like all these complicated systems."
"5015500","5019920"," I don't know if any of you guys do anything outside of go to a resort or something. "
"5020880","5025240"," Do you got any guys that go out there and do anything like hike and bike and ski and surfing."
"5026300","5030240"," I don't know what like the older that you get though the less you want to deal with."
"5031340","5033640"," You don't want to deal with like all these mechanical things. "
"5033640","5034740"," You're like yeah fuck all this."
"5035300","5036720"," Just throw all that shit in the trash."
"5037460","5040320"," Just give me a broken down sailboat with nothing on it. "
"5044380","5045520"," It's so true."
"5045820","5048560"," Trust me the more you do that stuff the more you're like I don't need any of this stuff."
"5051240","5054180"," I just want to ride my bike all day long out in the middle of desert. "
"5061080","5065280"," You know I got this like pump or electric battery operated shower."

"5070480","5071700"," Looks like a dildo or something."
"5071860","5075900"," You just drop it in the five gallon bucket and it turns on a pressure shower. "
"5075900","5080380"," Like sit outside the middle of desert with my shorts on or some just spray myself down."
"5080740","5081980"," It's quick fast easy."
"5082540","5083880"," This thing's rechargeable. "
"5084080","5086280"," I don't think you have any of the systems for it."
"5092340","5097180"," Any of the nonsense that it entails."
"5103750","5106810"," Talking about putting chemicals through stuff to kill typhoid. "
"5108710","5109370"," Hold on."
"5109390","5112810"," I got somebody laughing at me via text because they were the person I was talking to yesterday."
"5114230","5114930"," About this. "

"5152480","5156180"," There was a time when I bought a I bought an old broken down."
"5157200","5160220"," I brought an old broken down on Winnebago brave."
"5161600","5163380"," And that thing was fucking awesome. "
"5164740","5167300"," I usually don't do campers at all."
"5167760","5173000"," But I did buy one once and I I did like I crossed the country hiking backpacking trip and it"
"5173000","5173480"," was awesome."
"5174260","5175940"," And you have to do shit with that thing. "
"5176020","5178520"," You just parked started hiking bike and do whatever you're doing."
"5178740","5183700"," Come back and there was cold beer and there was a shower and a sinner in a cool place to"
"5183700","5184520"," sleep with some fans."
"5184520","5187220"," I don't think I don't know if I had an air conditioner or not that but. "
"5188280","5189800"," Desert nights are always cool anyways."
"5196860","5200760"," Yeah, so John Lock John K Lopp is saying we got a great deal and a load of 25 a"
"5200760","5204100"," camper power everything everything breaks down and you have to learn how to do it manually to"

"5205060","5205460"," Motors. "
"5205460","5206380"," Yeah, everything costs."
"5207120","5209600"," So none of this stuff is cheap like that's the other thing."
"5210180","5214840"," Like John saying like if you if you don't if you don't understand anything about electronics or"
"5214840","5215680"," electrics or. "
"5216280","5218680"," Any of that stuff you're going to pay off the nose."
"5222200","5222900"," Going out here."
"5226170","5227710"," Get some weirdness going on the background. "
"5229150","5230010"," Squeezing higher now."
"5236950","5241350"," So you have to not do this stuff by yourself be willing to do that work or you just start"
"5241350","5242590"," ripping it out is my point."
"5243130","5244690"," You're just like fucking I don't need it. "
"5245950","5248550"," And this shit always breaks at the worst possible moment."
"5251610","5254570"," It always breaks the worst possible moment doesn't work or something."
"5254570","5261270"," Like really when you need it when you try and enjoy yourself. "
"5261590","5263590"," Anybody that's a sailor knows what I'm talking about."
"5271380","5276040"," When you just want something to work and you want it to be the simplest most dumb down."

"5311820","5313400"," No trade in here for me right now."
"5316720","5318040"," It is fate isn't it."
"5318260","5319140"," I see you out there. "
"5319440","5322580"," I see I'm talking to you right now on stream but you're texting me."

"5335760","5338280"," I load this thing up right it's got everything in it."
"5338360","5339140"," It's got the bikes."
"5339140","5343280"," It's got everything to just drive out of here just go. "
"5344500","5348520"," And so I leave camp and get in there backpack and hike and whatever."
"5348520","5350280"," And I got wife kids and stuff like that."

"5360020","5360320"," I don't know."
"5360980","5362660"," Like black and shiny and stuff."
"5363320","5364740"," And I load everything up into that thing. "
"5365740","5367320"," And so I'm ready to go skiing."
"5367320","5369360"," It's just let's go get and you know put your clothes on."
"5369440","5369920"," We're out of here. "
"5371100","5373800"," Like efficiency and going to enjoy things."
"5376570","5379450"," And so that's what I did this week and was get ready for spring and summer."
"5379670","5382430"," Hopefully you guys are able to do that get ready for spring and summer to do something. "
"5386300","5388820"," Even if you're poor you should be able to get out there and do something."
"5393510","5394990"," Your van has manual everything."
"5405440","5408640"," Jill Jill's saying how amazing how much it costs to live like a homeless person. "
"5408780","5409000"," It is."
"5409180","5409960"," It's not cheap right."
"5410680","5411220"," It's not cheap. "
"5412040","5412980"," It's not cheap."
"5415400","5417540"," Yeah your your van has manual everything."
"5421880","5422880"," Yeah nothing breaks. "
"5424880","5426540"," Do you mind mostly beach camping."
"5428320","5429900"," Yeah backups to the backups."
"5430260","5434940"," I'm telling you like so after all these years after all this nice stuff as I'm getting older. "
"5435100","5436780"," I just want less breakage."
"5437260","5438820"," Just want something easy."
"5444850","5447490"," Am I bearish on the week. "
"5448030","5452790"," Let's talk about so my positioning or my thought process here is this."
"5454010","5455510"," Is until proven wrong."
"5456470","5459530"," We're in rotate a rotation trade. "
"5460550","5461670"," Now with that said."
"5463430","5467390"," So normally what happens is this we get excited right if you're a bear even if you're a bully or"
"5467390","5469150"," like I'm taking the money and running them out of here."
"5471660","5476120"," Normally what happens is we'll hit that top like Friday we hit that top. "
"5476620","5482240"," And for anywhere from a few days to a couple weeks we have a rotation trade that takes place."
"5483180","5485120"," Now as that rotation is taking place."
"5486160","5491660"," You can see weakness in certain sectors but not failure in those sectors. "
"5491920","5492940"," And that's what you're looking for."
"5493280","5499020"," You're trying to watch and find out if there's failure in those sectors for what's called a"
"5499020","5499940"," liquidation event."
"5500660","5505920"," Full liquidation right or if we're just consolidating. "
"5506560","5515760"," And giving time for that for from the market to rotate and then re enter those other sectors."
"5517420","5523020"," So price matters over the next week to two weeks price matters."
"5523540","5524800"," I'll show you some examples of it. "
"5527140","5529920"," Where you want to be aware of this stuff."
"5530580","5532780"," I'm going to show you some examples of this right now."
"5533840","5535160"," So if you're if you're a bearish. "
"5536180","5537680"," Especially if you're a bear this is."
"5538380","5540000"," Well I don't know being a bull."
"5540560","5541880"," I look for this stuff. "
"5544040","5547500"," So when you see people out there say I'm super bearish market's going to burn and crash."
"5548520","5549780"," That kind of stuff."
"5551900","5556440"," You need to be looking if you're a bear for certain signs of let me see if I can bring"
"5556440","5556860"," this up. "
"5557960","5559240"," Explain this better to you."
"5561930","5563750"," So there's a few things to say number one."
"5564330","5567090"," We get to that point where a bull is like I'm going to take profit right. "
"5567430","5568270"," I'm going to take profit and run."
"5570800","5572560"," And I'm going to wait for a dip to buy."
"5573000","5573880"," That's what a bull says. "
"5574340","5574900"," Take profit."
"5575140","5577820"," I'm going to wait for a dip to buy if one presents itself."
"5578900","5580720"," Or I'm going to rotate into another sector. "
"5583780","5586540"," Bears usually pick that top and they're like it's done."
"5586760","5589320"," This is the top and we're done."
"5589760","5590840"," Usually too early. "
"5591400","5593300"," Usually it takes days to a couple weeks."
"5594140","5595260"," And you will actually see."
"5595720","5597040"," I'll show you some examples of this. "
"5599320","5601200"," You will actually see new highs."
"5602040","5603840"," Like we got on the open today."
"5604240","5605320"," Not usually but you can. "
"5605840","5607420"," I should say see new highs."
"5608140","5609680"," And I'll show you some examples of that right now."
"5609680","5625990"," So here are"
"5625990","5628150"," some examples of it in the past okay. "
"5629730","5631730"," You know just right here we hit a peak right here."
"5632450","5634290"," And what do we do we ground all the way up."
"5634750","5637170"," Now this is actually another example of something I want you to see here. "
"5637950","5639710"," And especially this one right here is a big one."
"5640350","5641610"," Let's tell two different things."
"5642690","5643350"," We're on highs. "
"5643710","5646090"," You can actually see us grind higher grind higher grind higher."
"5647250","5647330"," Right."
"5648750","5649750"," It's in a daily chart. "
"5650410","5652230"," Grind higher grind higher grind higher grind higher."
"5652230","5654310"," We can actually keep continue to grind higher here."
"5656210","5659530"," And just keep grinding keep grinding keep grinding keep grinding. "
"5659530","5661610"," Another crazy thing about this is two fold."
"5662010","5664870"," Something that we've been seeing recently since October."
"5665610","5667150"," December was one of the key giveaways. "
"5668730","5670990"," December was a key giveaway if you look right here."
"5672610","5673130"," Right."
"5673850","5675030"," See that top right there. "
"5676210","5679630"," We had price follow right."
"5681330","5684030"," Price follow as breath went down."
"5685170","5687670"," That was good for the bears really good. "
"5689350","5694150"," The next the next time though this happened right here."
"5696800","5698880"," We didn't see price follow."
"5700980","5705800"," See the stark difference in price as breath went down. "
"5706620","5709780"," And so if you're a bear out there you're going to be looking for that."
"5709780","5711700"," There's two things you're looking for."
"5711820","5714320"," You're looking for the topping process. "
"5716140","5718860"," And then you're going to be watching the breath as it goes down."
"5719160","5722040"," And you want to see if price goes down just a little bit."
"5724750","5725710"," Topping process. "
"5726630","5728730"," Then does the price come down just right here."
"5730230","5731070"," Does that make sense."
"5732810","5734070"," As breath comes down. "
"5734610","5737490"," Or does price accelerate to the downside."
"5738090","5738510"," Does that make sense."
"5738510","5741770"," You're going to be watching these things because what happens is this. "
"5741970","5742910"," You'll get this tunnel vision."
"5744090","5746210"," Well first of all we're doing the topping process."
"5748010","5751030"," Which can actually go much higher right to be aware of that. "
"5751250","5756570"," And then the second problem is that as we do this topping process and we actually lose bread here."
"5757330","5759570"," If we don't get price acceleration of the downside."
"5760490","5763410"," It's indicative of what took place back here back here. "
"5763930","5764910"," But not here."
"5764910","5769290"," So this is really like this bottom back here in October was really key."
"5770770","5777670"," This was really key where this was the last time that price accelerated with breath going down. "
"5778430","5781110"," And currently at this moment we're not seeing that right."
"5781550","5783390"," Currently we're in the topping process."
"5784430","5785030"," Okay. "
"5786430","5788870"," And we're not seeing breath go roll over yet."
"5789470","5791550"," So when we begin to see breath roll over."
"5792470","5794430"," Is when you're going to look for. "
"5795710","5799470"," Whether we get a liquidation event or not."
"5800530","5804250"," And that liquidation event is when we start selling hard and heavy."
"5804590","5805630"," And price matters. "
"5806110","5807270"," It really does matter."
"5808330","5811970"," And one of the key points on this was back in December."
"5812170","5813350"," This is December right here. "
"5815090","5818130"," There was a moment in the beginning of this process here."
"5818730","5820290"," Where we had high risk."
"5821550","5822390"," Of a liquidation event. "
"5824850","5828470"," But what happened was as the days progressed and the weeks progressed."
"5829950","5831570"," We began to lose."
"5833790","5834870"," The risk. "
"5836490","5840350"," Of a liquidation event in the market was being accumulated."
"5840350","5843650"," And this gave you a heads up that price was going to actually."
"5844190","5847270"," Go higher price wasn't showing it here. "
"5847770","5849650"," We had this explosive move up."
"5850970","5851490"," Right."
"5851650","5851950"," This is where the. "
"5852110","5856150"," Now it's dumb man money chasing where smart money was buying down here."
"5856610","5857070"," Makes sense."
"5858290","5860590"," We actually exploded into a move higher. "
"5860770","5863070"," This caught a lot of people the wrong way."
"5863170","5864430"," They thought we were going down."
"5865010","5867970"," But in fact this all the smart money was buying down here. "
"5868430","5869870"," Even though price didn't show it."
"5870530","5875030"," And so we're looking for the signs of this in these first couple of weeks."
"5875030","5876610"," And right now just in the. "
"5876850","5878470"," Just in the topping process."
"5879050","5880870"," This could last two weeks."
"5881350","5883950"," Could last two, three days and price. "
"5883970","5886970"," Like if you think that this is a high price or at a four or nine."
"5887390","5890050"," No, four thirty no problem."
"5890650","5892370"," We can hit four thirty with no problems. "
"5892450","5893170"," It's possible."
"5894210","5896690"," For us to hit four thirty four twenty four thirty."
"5897090","5898850"," Hit this high right here at four seventeen. "
"5899330","5901030"," Clean out some of these shorts up here."
"5901870","5905150"," Another issue that we have is every dip gets bought right."
"5905270","5906290"," If every dip gets bought. "
"5906710","5910050"," If you see apple and video."
"5910430","5911330"," If you see apple and video."
"5913090","5914770"," Not following with price. "
"5938160","5943100"," And you can see we're a little overbought here on the daily right."
"5943420","5945220"," We're starting to roll on the hourly here."
"5946400","5946920"," Right. "
"5947080","5949880"," But look at where an video is still bullish."
"5949880","5953300"," It's still fucking bullish at three ninety eight seventy two."
"5953440","5956040"," It's still bullish at four oh six. "
"5956440","5957140"," Tries to spy."
"5958060","5959240"," You're in the wrong one here."
"5969440","5974940"," Nvidia right still bullish and it's hourly at two seventy four fifty five and it's still bullish at"
"5974940","5976820"," two fifty one fifty seven. "
"5978580","5979140"," Right."
"5979320","5981240"," So you what I'm talking to you about is."
"5981860","5983040"," These dips can be bought. "
"5983840","5985300"," And even if there's weakness."
"5987100","5989460"," Down here it's still bullish."
"5989800","5991380"," It's not at this point. "
"5991860","5995780"," Any kind of it's not bearish trend is up still."
"5996180","6000880"," It's just another opportunity for bulls to buy at two seventy four right now to buy at two fifty"
"6000880","6001200"," one."
"6001680","6003100"," And what's crazy is. "
"6003540","6007380"," What's crazy is if you get this if you get this trade down."
"6007960","6013660"," And we spend time bouncing around in here the longer we spend here the more bullish it becomes."
"6014680","6017080"," Okay now there's risk here in the beginning. "
"6017300","6018640"," This is like spy in December."
"6019060","6019860"," There's risk of."
"6021360","6023460"," Liquidation event if we go down there. "
"6024000","6026440"," But if we start just consolidating in here."
"6026820","6030680"," It's telling you that as we head into April and mid May."
"6031380","6034560"," We're likely going to rip faces off heading into summertime. "
"6035360","6037320"," So we won't need to pay attention to this."
"6038460","6043440"," And you know it's not it's not quacking and walking in like a duck right now is it."
"6043940","6049940"," You're not seeing the open this morning with blood baths below the hourly trigger and video blood"
"6049940","6050620"," bath below. "
"6051160","6051980"," We should have been trading."
"6052400","6056400"," I know bears out there like fuck that we should have been trading into two fifty one."
"6057300","6059620"," By in the day today I know bears are saying that. "
"6063520","6065180"," That's not what's happening is it."
"6067540","6070380"," So this is the topping process that's taking place."
"6072040","6074160"," Well let's see if we can get some sellers in here. "
"6074920","6077020"," Kind of like last place for sellers right here."
"6077660","6081680"," Otherwise we're going to close all this bullshit up here at four ten and eighty eight right we know"
"6081680","6081940"," that."
"6091000","6093000"," So my bearish are bullish here. "
"6094780","6097160"," The question was my bullish are bearish here."
"6098000","6099740"," We're in the middle of a topping process."
"6103400","6105540"," I will likely see more highs. "
"6106180","6109140"," Likely is a high probability of it that we'll see more highs."
"6109900","6113760"," It's likely that we're going to rotate into other sectors max those out."
"6114380","6117040"," And then we're likely going to find a bottom that's reasonable. "
"6118260","6120880"," A bottom that's reasonable to buy believe it or not."
"6121840","6124060"," The JPM caller was bullish."
"6124460","6127900"," I know you don't want to believe that but the JPM caller was bullish on the market. "
"6129860","6133640"," Jamie Diamond I don't know what he's out there saying I'm paying too much attention to the caller"
"6133640","6136980"," either but the caller is bullish it's to the right and up."
"6137840","6140600"," That's what it's saying and to further that point."
"6141520","6142540"," The higher that we go. "
"6143480","6146840"," So there's some fun fun things to know about the JPM caller."
"6147280","6148880"," We'll some neat things to know."
"6150940","6152980"," If we trade higher right in the beginning. "
"6153720","6157080"," The market's actually free at that point to do whatever it wants right."
"6157360","6163100"," If they make the money on the top side it pays for the bearish side of that trade."
"6163980","6167600"," So we don't actually have to trade down to those lower those lower lows. "
"6168160","6171660"," There's no requirement to if we do trade down to those near those lower lows."
"6172100","6176220"," Those magnets actually do make a make their important and then they'll attract price."
"6177020","6179480"," But we have no reason to have to trade down there. "
"6186500","6188020"," Yeah they rolled the strikes higher."
"6188560","6192080"," They rolled the strikes higher and it's crazy is the caller."
"6192620","6197520"," I'm not going to explain it here because I've explained it here too many times but there's no"
"6197520","6198080"," requirements. "
"6199120","6204320"," Once they once once they printed the high the high numbers or like they did Q1 they printed them."
"6204440","6206640"," I think in the first month they printed them."
"6206840","6210220"," So the moment that happened the market was free to do whatever it wanted. "
"6210940","6218700"," They'll always be a magnet to lower highs right if there isn't any kind of demand for higher highs."
"6219220","6222260"," So if there are so it's hard to explain like."
"6222620","6224860"," So if the markets like we're going to keep buying calls. "
"6226040","6229800"," We're going to keep buying the market we can actually we're free to go higher."
"6230580","6235420"," Now if the market loses demand to go higher we'll float right back down."
"6235600","6239520"," That's where the that's where the caller actually works to suppress volatility on the up and down"
"6239520","6239880"," side. "
"6240240","6243100"," We'll actually begin to go lower again or drift lower."
"6244040","6250540"," But there's no like requirement that we trade those lower numbers unless there's no more demand to"
"6250540","6250920"," go higher."
"6251360","6253380"," It will then pull the market down to those numbers. "
"6261230","6262570"," If price gets that low."
"6264550","6267710"," I mean if I was a bear it would be pretty fucking pissed off at that caller."
"6268530","6269130"," At that role. "
"6270350","6275910"," Because that role is telling you that that was the low for some period of time in the future that"
"6275910","6276910"," they're not expecting."
"6277950","6280450"," The market to trade twenty eight hundred."
"6281610","6285510"," Three thousand if you were if you were watching that role come out. "
"6286010","6289170"," You wanted to if you're a bear you wanted to see."
"6290130","6294830"," The three thousand I was thinking was thirty sixty or something thirty sixty five whatever the fuck"
"6294830","6295510"," it was when they."
"6295990","6298130"," When they redid it you wanted to see. "
"6300190","6302010"," I'm about to buy some calls here."
"6305750","6307090"," You wanted to see."
"6308690","6310270"," It go from thirty sixty. "
"6310670","6315210"," I think that was I think it was thirty six hundred or thirty six whatever it was thirty six"
"6315210","6315470"," hundred."
"6316050","6319730"," And then three zero six in the low end you wanted to see like twenty eight hundred."
"6321170","6324630"," That's what you wanted to see for the for the lower strike here like bearish like we're gonna have"
"6324630","6325150"," a market crash. "
"6328600","6332200"," That's what you wanted to see you want to see him staircase is down right now."
"6332800","6334340"," They're telling you low is in."
"6335680","6336860"," Not the low but. "
"6337620","6343160"," The market low right now is in like are we gonna are we are we probably gonna trade a twenty"
"6343160","6344280"," eight hundred probably not."
"6345580","6349760"," The likelihood of us trading down there has become less less likely."
"6349760","6357740"," And I think I can. "
"6357860","6359900"," Don't don't quote me on this."
"6361130","6363440"," I haven't looked it up yet but I'm gonna look it up."
"6363720","6364480"," If I recall. "
"6365680","6368480"," In the December twenty twenty one."
"6369400","6370320"," Collar roll."
"6371500","6375380"," That collar was lower for q one of twenty twenty two. "
"6375920","6381200"," And I thought I remember that day don't don't fucking hold me to this because I'm trying to"
"6381200","6383380"," remember every fucking day of the year."
"6383380","6385840"," But I think I remember that day."
"6386540","6390080"," We sold off hard and heavy on the release of that collar information. "
"6391480","6392420"," It could be wrong."
"6393120","6397240"," Or maybe it was the maybe it was the August September roll."
"6397700","6401460"," That had lower lows in the in the collar and it actually impacted the market. "
"6401660","6402100"," I would assume."
"6403520","6405480"," At the moment that that number came out."
"6406400","6410840"," People got scared they were like oh shit we've hit the market low for the year or not the year"
"6410840","6411760"," but for right now. "
"6413380","6414700"," With the higher roll."
"6415920","6417680"," But the move is up not down."
"6418660","6419980"," That does have an impact. "
"6425160","6427780"," Didn't we talk last week didn't I say to you last."
"6428160","6429560"," I think I even gave you."
"6430000","6431700"," I said to you last week. "
"6432340","6437040"," Look for thirty two hundred as the as the low number I think I think I can go back."
"6437480","6439660"," And find that clip where I said."
"6440240","6441640"," If you see thirty two hundred. "
"6442480","6446340"," You see you know like forty three hundred or something forty four hundred."
"6446340","6448300"," I think he said that forty three hundred on the upside."
"6449200","6451120"," I think I even gave you the strikes. "
"6451740","6455360"," I think I was pretty close to what I what I expected."
"6455640","6457060"," And if you saw those strikes."
"6458340","6462360"," Now there is some argument out there that would say oh we're free to crash now that we're not edged"
"6462360","6462840"," for it. "
"6464280","6467840"," These guys have smart people in the background doing this stuff for them."
"6468140","6469820"," And you have people that follow that shit."
"6470680","6471900"," Like trade to that shit. "
"6493460","6494700"," Can't motherfuckers be broke."
"6496600","6498680"," Maybe I missed an I don't know a part of that conversation."
"6500440","6502720"," Thanks for the saying something about the great stream. "
"6502720","6503480"," I appreciate that."
"6507080","6510200"," Why am why M.F.ers can't be broke sometimes."
"6510720","6514820"," Sometimes it's cool to be flossed but don't buy an eighty five thousand dollar car for you by"
"6514820","6515060"," house. "
"6517860","6521640"," I agree with that to an extent."
"6532900","6535240"," The buying calls looking pretty fucking bullish here isn't it."
"6535680","6537000"," Price is above right now. "
"6537080","6538300"," We've broken through sellers."
"6541300","6544840"," See this to this book map where sellers are trying to pin us right here."
"6544980","6547180"," Sellers trying to sell radio to get a five minute chart. "
"6548040","6549280"," See what that's telling you."
"6553060","6555080"," Saying that we've got resistance here."
"6556200","6558800"," Book maps telling us we have some resistance here. "
"6563220","6565480"," You break through this is going to be a squeeze though."
"6571230","6574390"," Let's start squeezing the fuck out of this in a second if we can get above."
"6580950","6583690"," We see here four oh nine four oh nine P."
"6585410","6586550"," Forty eight cents. "
"6588650","6591190"," Four tens are fifty four cents."
"6594420","6596020"," Fifty two cents right now."
"6597460","6600060"," I'd like to buy both sides to be honest with you. "
"6614840","6616340"," I'm going to fix really quick."
"6620540","6624100"," And the big skin getting cut up again."
"6631990","6633630"," Yeah I've done more in depth. "
"6634130","6638070"," JPM I've gotten like I've talked about JPM color for hours on end."
"6638650","6644410"," It's hard to try to try to explain it simply to people is try to try to dumb it down."
"6645790","6649950"," Because you there's not a defined like. "
"6650810","6654710"," It's really like a I wanted to sit calling it's like a dynamic trade."
"6654850","6657150"," It's a bear seagull but it's a very dynamic trade."
"6658350","6662390"," If the seagulls put on right we trade up to the to the higher strikes. "
"6663430","6667450"," The puts are the the bearish side of that trade is now a free trade."
"6669030","6672930"," And there's no requirements to fill that trade because all that all that."
"6673110","6675090"," So now the banks are hedged. "
"6675450","6675950"," Does that make sense."
"6675950","6677430"," Banks are now hedged."
"6677710","6679910"," The markets free to do whatever the fuck it wants. "
"6681330","6683790"," They don't care because if we trade lower."
"6684610","6686330"," They're going to be protected and."
"6687150","6691890"," So the magnet side of that down trade is as long as we trade sideways and up the banks are"
"6691890","6692150"," fine. "
"6692630","6694790"," If we start to trade below a certain number."
"6695710","6697450"," They want the magnet to kick in."
"6697930","6701690"," So that they can cover the losses for them being long the market. "
"6702410","6702970"," Right."
"6703230","6706430"," And then there's another side to the all of this where it's at."
"6706610","6709650"," It's also used to retard the options market. "
"6710470","6712550"," From going too high or too low."
"6712670","6714050"," We don't want real price discovery."
"6714450","6717530"," You as a trader as an investor would never want. "
"6718990","6722870"," True price discovery in this market in a bank wants nothing more than."
"6723150","6726910"," We trade within within a range month in month out."
"6727070","6728650"," We might have one or two months we trade. "
"6728650","6729750"," We get run over."
"6730710","6735230"," Or we get we trade one or two months where we go way way way lower below the implied move."
"6735790","6736550"," For the quarter. "
"6738050","6742970"," But generally speaking in acts it's in good and sounding good faith, but it is kind of in good"
"6742970","6743250"," faith."
"6748640","6753500"," It's a living it's a living thing that it's a living thing that point here is where you try to"
"6753500","6754140"," ask somebody."
"6754900","6757920"," That understands the technical side of the trade. "
"6759200","6765080"," What to expect to happen here that expectation is only as good as the price in the market."
"6765880","6770840"," It can change its impact changes on the market paying more prices."
"6773140","6778120"," So to pin somebody down on the JPM color is kind of difficult to even though we do pin to"
"6778120","6780540"," specific numbers over time. "
"6782080","6784840"," We're attracted to those numbers over time."
"6791940","6792720"," Mm hmm."
"6793820","6794840"," Absolutely great low. "
"6801830","6807250"," Oh, you're you're you're you're I I fucking sold out of these puts I think here."
"6809150","6812430"," And I haven't touched any of this I don't want anything to do with this shit."
"6813830","6815090"," What nothing to do with it. "
"6816030","6817390"," I'd really like to see."
"6818690","6820790"," We're getting in the bull's crosses here."
"6821890","6825270"," I want to show it to you right now we are on the bull's cross right now. "
"6825850","6827450"," Let's see the bull's cross right here."
"6828850","6832290"," We've got these sellers here and they're about to get squeezed like really bad."
"6833590","6835870"," Pretty bad squeeze coming up on deck right now. "
"6837470","6840690"," Pain trade is on for bears right here for sellers."
"6841890","6847160"," A couple targets above."
"6867560","6869320"," See where we got some supply up there. "
"6872300","6875150"," Look at that."
"6878570","6882470"," Oh, man, these sellers, man."
"6883330","6888830"," Just sell side right now. "
"6893930","6898030"," Sell sides like sell sides like they're all right here."
"6898950","6900870"," Sell side is like right here."
"6903510","6909140"," This is just pure sell side just trying to stop this from happening. "
"6911240","6912800"," They call it seller age."
"6918230","6920390"," It's going to get violent here in just a moment."
"6927220","6928400"," It's going to get violent. "
"6932670","6935370"," Yeah, you guys know what this happens, right?"
"6935550","6938170"," We just start you just put like a call spread on."
"6938510","6942270"," Put a cheap ass hedge on and just watch this nastyness happen."
"6946320","6947280"," Just gross. "
"6956590","6959450"," Not the bears day that they're looking for here."
"6967800","6970460"," Oh, pain trade is on right now."
"6973700","6975360"," Pain trade is on. "
"6976000","6977100"," Here goes the pain."
"6981120","6982120"," Oh, man."
"6989210","7000680"," Just pain"
"7000680","7001380"," trade on. "
"7007020","7009640"," Yeah, I mean, we knew it was going to happen into Friday, right?"
"7009820","7011720"," We knew it was going straight to the fucking moon."
"7012280","7018080"," The only question we had on Friday was with those calls that were put on the market in the open"
"7018080","7020960"," if in the open, would they print at the end of the day or not?"
"7021800","7025260"," It was looking like they weren't and then the end of the day just went straight north and printed"
"7025260","7026660"," all those calls for the banks."
"7027500","7028700"," That was really nice to see. "
"7034370","7035610"," There's Tesla going to survive."
"7035850","7037030"," Yeah, Tesla's bullish air, man."
"7037590","7039370"," I know you don't think that it is, but it's super bullish. "
"7045640","7048500"," You don't want to be like the top Tesla buyer."
"7048700","7052500"," You can see Tesla's bouncing beautifully off of its weekly right now."
"7052500","7056640"," And it's bullish as long as we've paid above 190. "
"7057540","7058480"," It's super bullish."
"7059860","7061420"," Nothing bearish about Tesla right now."
"7062520","7062960"," Nothing. "
"7064040","7064920"," That's like asking."
"7065400","7066320"," That's like asking."
"7066600","7067920"," Let me tell you about Tesla. "
"7070200","7071080"," We put it to you."
"7071240","7072400"," We put it to you a different way."
"7075720","7077000"," Put it to you a different way. "
"7083770","7085230"," Put it to you a different way."
"7087570","7087890"," Sorry."
"7088630","7088950"," Ready. "
"7089770","7093590"," Put it to you a different way."
"7094030","7094770"," By the dip."
"7097620","7099500"," I don't know, man, I don't want to buy the dip. "
"7099740","7101260"," I don't, I can't buy the dip, man."
"7101420","7102160"," I don't want to buy the dip."
"7102360","7103680"," I don't want to buy the dip. "
"7103820","7104640"," I don't want to buy the dip."
"7109280","7112280"," Can't buy the dip."
"7112280","7120490"," I don't know a man who can't buy the dip. "
"7120770","7121890"," Oh shit."
"7122050","7122930"," I want to buy the dip."
"7123350","7126230"," Makes sense Sells back down here. "
"7126330","7136210"," It's the hourly comes back down to the weekly And you're like yeah Almost ready to start buying"

"11862210","11870030"," down here into Early May it looks bullish to me overall doesn't look bearish so far the market's"
"11870030","11878730"," saying You know all this is to change right if you see a if you see an actual Structurally"
"11878730","11883490"," something different take place start trading out of a range This is where you're buying the dip"
"11883490","11883990"," down here."
"11884310","11889210"," Basically you're looking for a dip to buy down here if you're a bull When you look at the tee"
"11889210","11895870"," off above here for the next five days And see best dollars came in above here, and they're gonna"
"11895870","11905810"," likely step in above any kind of trade we do up here Garbage in here so"
"11905810","11924620"," far You"
"11924620","11930240"," can see that it's garbage right And I'm long calls and puts right now bouncing around probably"
"11930240","11938220"," gonna take both sides at one point I was fucking around with this stuff down here But at some point"
"11938220","11941940"," I'll pull both sides off and try to make a little bit of change on both sides of this trade"
"11942760","11944800"," So we make one more move up higher or lower."
"11945020","11959190"," I'll take each side off So"
"11959190","11964450"," What's my take on the next of the rest of the week is I don't know why this shit doesn't"
"11964450","11970290"," show up in a five-minute chart so my take here and the rest of the week is I've got"
"11970290","11971710"," a straddle on here, right?"
"11971910","11976790"," So I've got a straddle on For a move higher into the bell and I've got a straddle on so"
"11976790","11981410"," I can capture this into the clothes Otherwise, I've got no other trade here for today. "
"11981770","11982350"," This is what I've got."
"11982690","11987430"," I've got a straddle on four in a day today I don't think any down move is gonna hold it's"
"11987430","11992290"," gonna come right back up into this balance area in here or whatever fucking One day two day balance"
"11992290","11995950"," that we have Do I think that ultimately the move is down?"
"11996150","12002270"," Yeah, I think I think that over time Whether it takes this the rest of the wet rest week we"
"12002270","12008490"," have or the beginning next week It's gonna take time to sell into some kind of a lower move into"
"12008490","12008830"," the market."
"12008990","12011570"," I don't think it's just today I don't think we start blasting now. "
"12011630","12015190"," I think that's what a lot of you'll think is that We'd wake up this morning."
"12015330","12020610"," It'd be a bloodbath start smashing through levels And we clear all this up down here and then we're"
"12020610","12028670"," back to our normal train range and we're gonna try to get back up into 400 into Into end of"
"12028670","12029890"," quarter end of month or something."
"12030190","12031310"," That's not my take here. "
"12031530","12041690"," My take here is month of April is strong and you're in likely into May and And"
"12041690","12051450"," you're gonna be looking for a dip to buy down here with some confidence 390 400 unless something"
"12051450","12055210"," fundamentally changes All these buyers back here."
"12055330","12062150"," I trust all these buyers so far down here They're telling you That we're gonna make this the new"
"12062150","12072120"," range Which is to the right and slightly up And we do have some"
"12072120","12080760"," vol coming in to the market to in June So if we train it up into leading into June We're"
"12080760","12086740"," all super fucking bullish and then all of a sudden you get you know Mass casualty events in Ukraine"
"12086740","12094680"," you get the debt limits ceiling limit Fed minutes bunch of shit that is something that we don't"
"12094680","12104350"," know some material You know and you lead into that"
"12104350","12109090"," selling in the early June and then it's just consolidation It's not like a summer consolidation"
"12109090","12119180"," trade Summers sucks sometimes if we have more of a normalized market Here"
"12119180","12119400"," we go."
"12119500","12122320"," I'm gonna take the put side off here in just a moment. "
"12122320","12134050"," Hopefully So"
"12134050","12137250"," currently as it stands, what's my take on Q1?"
"12137990","12147070"," It's the same it's Look for a dip to buy If we just do this sideways bullshit for the next"
"12147070","12156170"," few weeks We need probably expect so the next week or two if we don't trade below that 398 400"
"12156170","12162090"," you're gonna be looking for a fucking dip to buy down there if price doesn't follow the rotation"
"12162090","12168690"," trade And we don't get a liquidation event like liquidation event to the market You'll probably see"
"12168690","12168850"," us."
"12169250","12176550"," You know we could do nine ten twelve sessions By a dip at 400 by a dip of three ninety"
"12176550","12184490"," eight Sell a rip Then we'll get a speech on my my assumption would be after nine or twelve trades."
"12184490","12194750"," It's good sound disgusting, but you would see The move higher into May mid-May That"
"12194750","12202650"," mid-May grind higher into four twenty four thirty something like that You would need You would need"
"12204250","12215310"," It's a good a four hour You know you're gonna need some you talking about all this buying a lot"
"12215310","12224980"," of Talking about all this buying down in here all this buying down in here"
"12224980","12231120"," all this buying down in here You're gonna need like some real serious Material selling here real"
"12231120","12237480"," serious material selling here real serious Material selling here for like yeah, you know burnin"
"12237480","12237840"," through that. "
"12237840","12242560"," We're got that would not even just we took the gap But we're not so we need like a material"
"12242560","12242980"," event."
"12243340","12248980"," I don't think that we have one I don't even think the Fed creates that maybe if there was a"
"12248980","12256000"," cutting of rates or something They would have to be something that we don't foresee Some kind of"
"12256000","12262960"," like material Material reason for the market to go that low there's three forty eight down there to"
"12262960","12268800"," get down there and start trading down there to thirty two hundred It needs to be like debt sale and"
"12268800","12278260"," shit needs to be It needs to be something It needs to be like I don't know 500th."
"12278320","12278960"," I mean third talk. "

"12320390","12322370"," So what do you tell me?"
"12323150","12331190"," you tell me something that The only thing that I could see here would be You know anything I could"
"12331190","12340270"," see here maybe for that kind of a down move would be Maybe they front-run June the debt ceiling"
"12340270","12348150"," crisis instead of it happening Beginning mid-June they they front-run it like middle of May maybe"
"12349090","12354430"," I'm assuming that's going to be the talk and into end-of-quarter mark my words on that right now,"
"12354430","12354750"," okay?"
"12357370","12366630"," That they'll be talked into April May and June right April May June, so you'll probably hear talk"
