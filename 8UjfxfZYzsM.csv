"80680","81160"," than normal. "
"84200","85900"," So hold on Amherst, switch right over."
"87320","88360"," That's kind of weird too."
"91960","93620"," That has changed slightly here. "
"94480","96940"," Let me just have patience over here for just a second."
"102760","106980"," Good morning to all of you out there for what I've got something to do here."
"109880","118540"," All my monitors are different than loading up on a bunch of new equipment for secondary setup. "
"119760","123740"," I'm also getting some new stuff for the show."
"126200","128060"," I've got some cool stuff to go over today."
"128800","130400"," Hold on one second here. "
"141960","142740"," Sorry about that."
"143340","148500"," I've got a children going back to school."
"149500","150900"," Stop that. "
"151180","155580"," You know, it's weird because this is right there."
"156320","161060"," I go members."
"166520","170500"," I've got a children. "
"174100","181480"," And said children have a lot of changes coming up for this school year."

"186500","188340"," This is where I've got a bunch of stuff to go over. "
"189900","192580"," We've got children have to have meetings with as well."
"193100","196380"," You know, moms don't want to think."
"196720","197100"," It's weird. "
"197960","198600"," Not really."
"198920","201360"," I've never been mean to my kids."
"202640","207220"," But I think historically women just keep things from men. "
"207720","209100"," But really with girls or kids."
"209340","211080"," I don't know what it's about."
"211220","212980"," It's just because that's the history of a girl. "
"213740","215680"," There's a way it's history of her own father or something."
"217440","219180"," A little bit of squeeze going on right now."
"219880","220840"," In the market. "
"221060","222900"," We'll talk about that here in just a moment."
"223160","223720"," Give some."
"224860","226480"," Just get ready in here. "
"229600","230560"," What is that?"
"234890","236270"," Bear with me here this morning."
"237450","238150"," Where did everybody?"
"238290","238730"," How's everybody doing?"
"241170","242450"," You about the dip on Tesla?"
"242710","242910"," Let's see."
"242990","243310"," Look at Tesla. "
"243470","244950"," We talked about Tesla on Saturday."
"246370","248270"," Hey, Quinn, if you're watching right now, man."
"254620","255740"," Hold on one second here. "
"263460","266800"," Give it an 8.10. Give it an 8.10. I don't want."
"267200","273440"," I don't know if this is geared towards me or not."
"273440","274360"," So. "
"277740","278480"," Morning everybody."
"278620","279040"," How's everybody doing?"
"279200","279500"," Good morning."
"284930","287650"," We talked about Tesla over the weekend. "
"289470","292610"," And check on make sure everything's going well on Twitch."
"292830","293750"," I got to show on Twitch."
"293750","294190"," Hopefully. "
"294470","294810"," Hell yeah."
"295010","295390"," Raise in there."
"299650","306550"," The treasury is extending this line with the 10 year yield, touching 4.2, 0.3%. We're going to look"
"306550","307330"," at X and Tesla. "
"307970","308610"," PayPal too."
"309470","310910"," PayPal was a dog, right?"
"311870","314510"," I ended up selling PayPal and never bought back in."
"315290","317310"," We're interested in that trade as well. "
"317490","318470"," We'll look at X this morning."
"319470","321630"," And we had a show on I think Saturday."
"323030","324870"," And we were talking about Tesla. "
"325370","327710"," And people said, what do you think about Tesla?"
"328250","331730"," I'm like, well, like if Nasdaq can hold its pants up."
"333110","336190"," There should be some consolidation in Tesla."
"338790","340650"," Let me turn some of this stuff off up here. "
"343130","344430"," That's kind of loud, wasn't it?"
"344750","345430"," Is that a little loud?"
"345890","349850"," There should be a little bit of consolidation in Tesla."
"351130","354250"," Wow, Nasdaq tries to hold its pants up."
"356930","360350"," And that Tesla a little bit more down to go. "
"361030","362790"," And what do we see this morning?"
"363890","365710"," The market not quite crashing."
"367890","374030"," Yet here comes Tesla limping in to the green box."
"374890","376250"," Let's see if we can look at the green box. "
"376250","376670"," Hold on."
"378530","380290"," Look at my boy Tesla over here."
"381730","384610"," I'm assuming you guys are not quite jumping the ground. "
"384990","386230"," Click on it right there."
"392530","394270"," Take a peek at Tesla here."
"395550","397630"," And there's the green box right down there. "
"397830","400890"," So can you see it down here?"
"401150","401770"," Here's the green box."
"403310","404330"," 30 minute chart."
"408650","409770"," We're back up here. "
"409830","410570"," Remember back up here?"
"412170","414510"," You all remember when we were back up here?"
"414830","416090"," You're like, Hey, what about Tesla cap?"
"416290","418190"," And I was like, yeah, it's probably going to fail up here."
"418230","419790"," Whether it does, it doesn't really matter."
"420630","422610"," Skill has a date with Destiny down here. "
"423710","424110"," No."
"426830","428590"," SB 500 down this morning."
"429230","429830"," Not by much. "
"430250","430590"," Not a ton."
"431630","434230"," As a matter of fact, the call spreads in after September."
"435110","435970"," Not bad. "
"436270","437350"," So they're looking pretty good."
"438050","442350"," No, we did talk about if NASDAQ works to consolidate."
"443310","444810"," Over the coming weeks, maybe week. "
"447350","449770"," If SMP can hold its pants up."
"451690","454970"," You could see a recovery here in process on SB 500."
"455730","457250"," And watch some of these tickers. "
"460410","464110"," For a dip eye on Tesla and some others."
"464450","467470"," Now, there's a note to be made here this morning."
"467630","469790"," If you're watching this cursor down below here. "
"470710","471230"," Down here."
"472750","480330"," Well, there's more to note here though, and that would be the daily trigger turning down as"
"480330","481790"," violently as it is right now."
"481990","486970"," So just as a heads up to you, if you are buying the dip or attempting to buy the dip"
"486970","490210"," on the SMP, not the SB 500, but Tesla specifically. "
"490630","491610"," You may be a little bit early."
"493110","499270"," We could go as low as 227 possibly in 2024."
"500070","501970"," Tesla's famous for having the dip bot early. "
"502410","503490"," Just so you know that."
"505450","507230"," If you want to take a Tesla."
"508550","510630"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick. "
"510630","512809"," Call spread with a range of 236."
"513549","518809"," And market profile levels by signing up at 232 excuse me, 232 to."
"520429","522390"," Two fifty one or something like that. "
"522830","524850"," It's not that risky of a trade."
"526350","528730"," So it encompass something like this here."
"532450","535410"," I guess you could do a fly on Tesla as well. "
"535610","536890"," Flies could be dangerous though."
"537510","538150"," With Tesla."
"538410","541330"," You know, Tesla would be one four five four five against the end. "
"541550","544810"," I lost up around here for four percent at one four five four five six."
"546470","548510"," So still that price target down here."
"548730","549510"," Two thirty six. "
"551570","552230"," That's thirteen."
"553890","555730"," You have two twenty six, but."
"557110","559470"," As the low on Tesla, but anything like that. "
"559650","561730"," Two thirty two two twenty six somewhere down in here."
"562290","564030"," I think you're going to be fine on Tesla."
"564030","564530"," So. "
"565290","566330"," Saying that though."
"567050","570510"," Is there a trap for bulls being laid?"
"571970","574130"," We're going to talk about that right now too."
"574250","576450"," Is there a trapping laid for bulls right now?"
"576570","577090"," So we're going to look at. "
"578550","579430"," E S."
"582790","583990"," It's on the downside here."
"586110","588890"," You can see price target one down below."
"590270","591550"," Forty four hundred. "
"591910","594290"," And then you get a price target two down here."
"596230","598630"," Forty three one six point seven."
"598910","601790"," If you can see this in the bottom chart, the bottom left inside here. "
"603690","605290"," This is the inflection point."
"605410","608630"," It actually started on Thursday, not Friday or the weekend."
"609610","611670"," The inflection point began back here. "
"613330","616910"," When we did not hold the hourly and the daily trigger."
"616910","617610"," That was it."
"617690","618930"," It was kind of on to the downside. "
"619850","621490"," And that that's kind of it right now."
"621550","624350"," You can see the daily figures rolling over right here right now."
"624430","626110"," If you look down below the screen down below. "
"627550","629290"," You can see it happening on E S."
"629950","633350"," And then even on your chart right here, you're watching it."
"633370","633570"," Okay."
"634410","635990"," So one minute chart on spoons. "
"636210","637250"," We're going to go to a five minute chart."
"637310","639090"," You can see the bear cross right here."
"639510","642470"," I want you to see that cross right there. "
"643650","645010"," This is in pre market."
"645470","648490"," You can see it again, selling off to the downside here."
"650370","652490"," Now I did make a mistake on Thursday. "
"652950","654130"," That's the pound dollar for winning."
"654310","657410"," There's about six percent around one spot two six one seven."
"657670","659790"," And that's the lowest thing since June 30th. "
"659910","661330"," Let me show you some more stuff here."
"662130","664430"," So I bought some call spreads for September down here."
"665670","666550"," Can you see that?"
"667410","668530"," I don't know if you can see that. "
"668770","674750"," Maybe not right there."
"680200","682800"," So I've got some call spreads for September down here."
"683360","685920"," I've got some call weeklies as well. "
"686580","688980"," Sold those I think exactly right there."
"689140","690120"," So pretty good on that trade."
"691120","696620"," And then I bought some more calls for next Friday on Thursday. "
"697460","701660"," It was added here, here, and then down here believe it or not."
"702120","705340"," Sometime in here, they were like 13 cents for next Friday for four."
"705340","706940"," Fifty nines. "
"707140","711740"," I'm still holding those right now down here for next Friday."
"712280","714220"," Not doing so bad right now, right?"
"714740","715740"," It could be a lot worse."
"716440","717540"," I'm losing some theta burn. "
"718100","719220"," I don't know if those ever print."
"719400","719880"," They were dirt cheap."
"720340","722640"," They didn't buy a ton, but it did DCA in June. "
"722960","726360"," So like a like a lot of trade for this Friday."
"726940","729600"," If we can turn this thing around turn this boat around."
"730400","734180"," Now a key point here is I want you to see something here and that would be. "
"734880","736840"," Is there a trap laid for bulls?"
"737560","739160"," Now there's a lot of room here."
"740180","742260"," For spoos to consolidate sideways."
"743560","744900"," The rest of this week. "
"746220","752360"," If that means that Tesla goes down to the two to 32 or 26 or something like that."
"752840","753720"," So be it."
"754160","756220"," But this is most certainly an inflection point here. "
"756960","760060"," And and bears are in control here as far as the bears are concerned."
"760060","764740"," They just they're just going to tee off on this daily trigger and the hourly trigger."
"765440","771340"," So above here at four forty four forty five eighty eight four forty seven fifty. "
"772680","776980"," Are going to be two key points for our places for for bulls."
"777460","784320"," I got to make a phone call here at some point, but the key point."
"784560","787040"," Like if you're a bull or a bear, there's some key points here. "
"787080","788580"," I want you to be aware of something here."
"789420","794060"," Regardless, if we turn around and head higher, something like that, I want you to understand that"
"794060","797800"," there are major sellers here sitting right above."
"798740","804380"," Now they're sitting right here and they're sitting right here and they want nothing more than to"
"804380","806440"," send this thing down much, much lower. "
"807040","809300"," And if you're a bull, you'll be aware of that."
"809580","812600"," If bulls fail, I'm going to show you something right now here."
"812600","812860"," Okay. "
"813720","820800"," If at any point bulls fail, fail this hourly trigger or this daily trigger."
"821500","823460"," It's going to start getting sent right down."
"823660","826480"," So as a bull, you'll be very taxable here buying dips. "
"827120","828960"," Be ready to sell them on the hourly trigger."
"829440","833380"," If you want to take the next trade, you need to have some confirmation that we're going higher."
"833800","834820"," Even saying all that. "
"836820","840700"," If we squeeze above the daily trigger for the brave England."
"841860","843380"," You're going to watch the hourly trigger."
"843880","844860"," Move higher, right?"
"845100","845920"," Move higher to DT. "
"846640","847680"," Come back down here."
"847880","848840"," Three billion pounds in bid."
"848960","850920"," And just like on Thursday, that doesn't hold. "
"851160","855120"," It's going to be used for a huge downside move over here."
"855180","858960"," So I'll be with you this week because I felt bad for Thursday, Friday."
"859140","859780"," I went back and look. "
"860240","864960"," It's funny because the buck calls on Thursday low at the close or just before, whatever that"
"864960","866560"," fucking low was when they were 13 cents."
"867620","870060"," I bought some 13 cent calls for this Friday."
"870060","872680"," Or DC aid for this upcoming Friday. "
"873200","877440"," But what's fascinating is when I did that, I wasn't looking at the charts."
"878060","878540"," I didn't check."
"878740","880560"," I wasn't looking at a five 15 nothing. "
"880920","881880"," Was it a bunch of meetings?"
"882460","883880"," Wasn't paying attention to the market."
"884360","889660"," And then Friday I looked back on Thursday and I go, fuck, I would never would have bought there on"
"889660","889980"," Thursday."
"890380","892040"," So the warning shot was here on Thursday. "
"892660","896980"," Can't see it there, but the warning shot was on Thursday Friday more down."
"896980","899340"," And this is kind of it for bulls."
"899640","900520"," You got no more choices. "
"900800","904020"," This is like, you've got, you basically have two places right here."
"904300","905380"," This is where they're teeing off."
"906200","907640"," They want, they want more down. "
"907920","911080"," So a lot of work for the bulls have them bears."
"912680","913520"," You're in control."
"913840","915400"," There's no, no, no two dots about it. "
"918280","918680"," Yeah."
"919020","920600"," So squeeze up."
"921420","928660"," And if you're a seller, these are your targets right here. "
"929800","932580"," As far as if this stuff starts selling off, man."
"932680","934660"," I was talking to some friends over the weekend."
"934800","936840"," I'm like, this thing really starts banging off this. "
"937080","939080"," If at any point we really start selling here."
"941140","942920"," It's kind of, I hate doing this."
"943360","944160"," I pissed away. "
"944500","946820"," I lost $20,000 on puts."
"948200","949720"," 20 fucking grand."
"953020","953860"," In the money. "
"956720","958740"," And I'm like, I'm going to be forced."
"958980","962000"," Like this would force if there's, if there's a role up here, right?"
"963560","969720"," I'm going to be forced into slamming a buy button on probably the 23, 20,000."
"969940","974140"," I mean, I made a ton of money on the way up anyways, but it doesn't fucking matter. "
"974240","974940"," It doesn't feel good."
"975300","979320"," It's in the money that I, the money that I put into that, into that money."
"979660","980320"," I owe taxes on. "
"980540","982600"," So not happy about that."
"983840","984900"," Unhappy about that."
"989880","991000"," So thoughts on Tesla. "
"991720","992980"," We're going to talk about it again."
"993120","994200"," We'll go over right now with you."
"995420","999220"," Just one quick second here and see if I can go and do Tesla here. "
"1000680","1002000"," I thought I talked about Tesla."
"1002260","1003060"," We'll talk about it again."
"1004140","1005780"," We talked about Tesla on Saturday. "
"1006840","1008200"," I think 60 people showed up."
"1008480","1009120"," It's really weird."
"1009340","1010680"," Like 60 people showed up to those videos. "
"1010680","1014200"," Then as soon as that shit comes through, there's like 3000 views."
"1015040","1016220"," So hold on a second here."
"1017420","1020680"," Go look at this one right here. "
"1021580","1022260"," There we go."
"1027140","1029220"," So we'll take a look at Tesla once more here."
"1030500","1031900"," So one minute chart on Tesla. "
"1033760","1035780"," You guys want to know about what I think about Tesla."
"1040780","1042160"," So intraday on Tesla."
"1042480","1043660"," There is a trade right now. "
"1044180","1052560"," As long as we stay above 236.22. 220 if we can see this right here."
"1052880","1053140"," Watch this."
"1053320","1055560"," You're looking for this move right here. "
"1059900","1062460"," So as long as Tesla can hold right here."
"1063620","1066240"," There's a trade above two spots of interest."
"1068480","1074440"," 239.25 and then 240 by the time it gets there. "
"1075980","1078160"," No closing bars on a one minute."
"1078820","1084540"," No like closing bars below 235."
"1085800","1087760"," No closing bars below 235. "
"1088600","1090580"," You need that kind of nonsense right there."
"1091140","1093440"," And you're going to cut your stops up here somewhere."
"1096380","1097860"," My thoughts on Tesla. "
"1100320","1101680"," We're kind of close right."
"1102060","1102300"," Look at that."
"1102460","1103020"," There's the green box. "
"1103740","1104360"," Super close."
"1105340","1106980"," So there's the green box right there."
"1107060","1108740"," We've been talking about for weeks now right. "
"1109420","1110680"," That's fairly close."
"1112080","1113800"," Fairly close to where it needs to be."
"1113800","1116440"," So call spread might be on order. "
"1119240","1122000"," For patients if you're just buying Tesla calls."
"1123700","1126360"," Maybe look for 226.72 for today."
"1126840","1128380"," A little low on that. "
"1129480","1131280"," Arely still coming down up here."
"1131840","1133760"," If you're looking to get really bullish on Tesla."
"1134740","1135680"," You want to wait and see. "
"1137100","1143020"," You'll be looking for pricing above 241 and trade that to 254."
"1145180","1146600"," That's my take on Tesla."
"1147080","1149960"," Tesla daily chart on a 30 minute is important. "
"1151560","1152980"," How negative is it?"
"1153200","1153580"," Not quite."
"1153900","1154960"," It's not quite there yet."
"1155840","1157540"," Do I expect more down in Tesla?"
"1158280","1159080"," Yes, I do. "
"1160580","1161420"," Yes, I do."
"1161520","1163800"," I think that I think regardless of where we go up here."
"1163940","1165460"," It's still coming down to test that. "
"1166520","1168540"," I think you might have one more bottom left."
"1169380","1174700"," Not a huge chance, but all like a 30% chance, 40% chance."
"1174980","1175800"," So we're going to see one more. "
"1176140","1178040"," Even if we squeeze up here, you have a failure."
"1178620","1183600"," In fact, I put a failure at 249.50 and then a roll down here."
"1183760","1184500"," And just one more touch. "
"1185700","1187540"," Wrap all those bulls one last time."
"1188340","1190000"," And before it actually starts to head higher."
"1190860","1193160"," My bearish in the long term and Tesla would be the next question. "
"1193880","1196680"," As of right now, no, pretty fucking bullish on Tesla."
"1197680","1199960"," Not bearish in any way, shape or form on it."
"1200640","1209000"," It's just a matter of, it's just a matter of giving a chance for bulls to buy nice dips. "
"1209780","1210920"," It's a nice one right there."
"1211840","1212300"," Bounce right here."
"1213000","1214240"," Fatty arc gone down. "
"1214460","1214500"," Right?"
"1215180","1218200"," In fact, the bulls were in down here."
"1218760","1218840"," Right?"
"1219060","1221000"," So they didn't care about any of this above, did they?"
"1221520","1225200"," They didn't care about what you thought would happen during their ER."
"1226420","1229220"," And the same thing goes for down below here as well. "
"1230260","1235940"," So if you're looking for that dip to buy on Tesla, you see it down here."
"1236140","1237320"," BAM comes right back down."
"1238280","1243500"," So to think that it would be a shocker to see Tesla, just do one more quick roll down before"
"1243500","1244860"," it actually starts to take off. "
"1245420","1248620"," I'm still looking for that last little bit down below in Tesla personally."
"1249560","1250940"," Tesla was down this morning, right?"
"1251260","1252760"," So we talked about that on Saturday."
"1253460","1260540"," If we can get some rotation going, you might still see companies be weak into Monday's open, and we"
"1260540","1261860"," specifically called out Tesla. "
"1262420","1264960"," And specifically Tesla was down this morning."
"1266280","1268780"," So if you want to buy this, I understand it."
"1268960","1270340"," I chase Tesla all the time. "
"1271860","1272480"," I do."
"1272680","1275600"," I end up like I want that last little tick."
"1276800","1277960"," And then I miss the dip buy. "
"1278940","1280340"," And then I'm like $5 later."
"1280540","1281100"," I jump on it."
"1281160","1282340"," I jump on it on that hourly. "
"1282340","1290680"," So if I end up missing something like this, I'll show you exactly what happens to me if I can't"
"1290680","1291380"," catch that bottom."
"1293080","1295940"," If I want that perfect tick down here, I miss it."
"1296080","1296940"," I do all the time. "
"1297060","1297420"," I miss it."
"1297980","1302860"," But then when it comes back up, if it holds, then this stuff supes down."
"1303300","1305740"," Then I do buy it on this trade and I take the rest of it up. "
"1305920","1308420"," So either way I jump on that train."
"1308420","1314340"," I'm still greedy for that last final tick on Tesla."
"1314580","1317900"," I'm sure most of you are like, oh fuck no, we're buying Tesla right now. "
"1317960","1318240"," It's done."
"1318880","1319500"," Seal deal."
"1320100","1321780"," So if you're going to do it, call spreads are kind of nice. "
"1323040","1323820"," So on Tesla."
"1324100","1324680"," Just in case, right?"
"1324760","1325500"," A little bit of peace of mind."
"1330600","1331560"," One second here. "
"1336080","1337300"," I got weird stuff."
"1337520","1337920"," Well, not weird."
"1337980","1339560"," I changed a bunch of stuff in the background. "
"1339840","1342360"," So I got everything is looking really won't keep."
"1343920","1344400"," Nope."
"1345700","1346340"," That's wrong. "
"1349740","1351140"," We need that cage fight."
"1351400","1352180"," That ain't never happening."
"1352680","1353200"," I saw that. "
"1353400","1356820"," I saw a couple of things."
"1357060","1362480"," I saw some people were talking about the, I saw the talk about."
"1365750","1368850"," Yeah, you see that man right underneath the early turn coming down. "
"1369270","1374360"," Let's go to the one minute."
"1374360","1375840"," See what's going on up here."
"1380390","1382710"," Keep this on spoos right now. "
"1386380","1387380"," See it right here."
"1389140","1391940"," This is a chart that we looked at on Saturday."
"1394180","1396460"," You guys remember this chart from the Saturday show?"
"1401120","1403100"," This is the Saturday show chart. "
"1403340","1403740"," You remember that?"
"1403980","1406000"," So we'll keep our eyes on this and see what happens there."
"1408680","1409700"," Screws squeezing right now."
"1413310","1420790"," Elon Musk and I saw, I saw, I saw the lizard man saying, you know, this is bullshit. "
"1420930","1422050"," I'm going to go fight serious people."
"1424350","1426110"," I saw the grease thing."
"1426270","1427910"," We're fighting in the, I don't know. "
"1428050","1429510"," We're fighting the Coliseum or something."
"1430370","1434270"," And then the prime minister's like, oh, I don't think we're going to be fighting in Greece."
"1434270","1436030"," We got a great phone call though. "
"1437230","1444590"," And then I did see the Cleveland Cliffs put an offer into buy US Steel."
"1444870","1446610"," We're talking about that US Steel here in just a moment."
"1450090","1453250"," And, and, uh, oh, there are other offers and bids. "
"1453490","1456010"," So it wasn't Cleveland Cliffs."
"1456130","1458510"," It was, it was Elon wanting to buy US Steel."
"1460090","1463370"," It's funny too, because I own a few points. "
"1463370","1466590"," I own a bunch of single letter stocks."
"1467350","1469070"," And I do not own X."
"1469430","1471130"," And we talked about that in the show."
"1471870","1478270"," I'm wanting to get the X symbol for the stock market. "
"1478950","1481350"," And I'm, I'm this morning, I'm like, I don't own that, do I?"
"1481630","1482930"," I don't like feeling like me."
"1490030","1491470"," I don't like."
"1491470","1493470"," X, Y and Z, but not W."
"1496550","1498210"," I own all except for X."
"1499650","1500930"," W, Y, Z."
"1502070","1502630"," And V."
"1504070","1504930"," I own T."
"1507810","1509970"," I don't think the fights ever going to happen. "
"1510230","1511070"," I don't, which is."
"1512350","1514090"," Well, that was the other thing that I read."
"1514250","1515470"," So if they buy US Steel. "
"1516750","1518810"," If they end up buying US Steel."
"1520710","1521730"," What is going on?"
"1521990","1524170"," I get some, I got a bunch of questions for you guys this morning."
"1526430","1528730"," Like, like, if they buy US Steel. "
"1530470","1532450"," Is he going to fight with the unions?"
"1532850","1535650"," Like, saw what happened with Twitter."
"1537110","1540490"," And the question becomes, does he, does the union break?"
"1541870","1544670"," If I was still worker, I'd be like, I'd be wondering."
"1548370","1550610"," If he's going to, if he's going to be a union breaker. "
"1553250","1556730"," So if you're, if you're in long calls here, right?"
"1557830","1559430"," Your job right now."
"1560790","1562770"," Is to show you here."
"1563790","1566850"," Just so you're clear, you take the money and run right here. "
"1568050","1569630"," Okay, there's a little bit of gap above."
"1571590","1573330"," You then allow it to consolidate."
"1573590","1574610"," If it begins to move higher. "
"1575430","1576810"," And wants to trade this here."
"1577790","1579450"," You don't then turn till above, right?"
"1579630","1580630"," We already know this, right?"
"1581410","1583010"," Talk about this every day, don't we?"
"1583850","1585150"," You can see it right now."
"1585770","1586950"," Trying to break above. "
"1589670","1591330"," We got some gap edge right there."
"1592830","1593890"," Free market gap."
"1600750","1602410"," I'll bring this in a frame for you. "
"1606200","1608000"," You got a little bit of gap edge right here."
"1610100","1614320"," How do we all give a one, two trigger cluster right now, right?"
"1614740","1620840"," Just looking for just looking for a confirmation right here."
"1621640","1624620"," You can see the bull on the one minute going higher. "
"1642990","1643670"," One second here."
"1658500","1660800"," Pay attention to this right here."
"1671880","1674580"," So you can sort of easier to see here. "
"1674980","1676060"," Just on this bottom."
"1679020","1682020"," Here's your first resistance, 44576."
"1683220","1684140"," Almost a second here. "
"1719660","1722620"," Pay attention to the down side of my screen down here."
"1724480","1726880"," You'll see this first point of resistance, right?"
"1726960","1728380"," I'll make it larger so you can see it."
"1790530","1793590"," The UK 38 yield rises to the highest. "
"1793890","1797790"," Yeah, right here as we squeeze up into this HT right here."
"1797930","1799170"," Starting to squeeze right now."
"1799470","1801010"," I got some zero dates, so we're good. "
"1803930","1805550"," First tag happening right now."
"1805650","1807170"," Second tag coming up in just a moment."
"1808850","1817340"," I'm 13 on 446 right now. "
"1867400","1868760"," Might have a quick roll."
"1869400","1870480"," So just be careful in here."
"1871780","1876150"," Quick roll back and then the squeeze up higher right here. "
"1879730","1883510"," So you might, you could get a quick, just quick roll."
"1883510","1885010"," Then the push up right here."
"1941870","1944070"," I'm like down a monitor right now too. "
"1944210","1945410"," I'm waiting for new connections."
"1962460","1964440"," I mean, we're trading this all day long."
"1978720","1983300"," Market's showing a little bit of volatility right here as you come up into this resistance above. "
"1998570","1999270"," Come on, baby."
"1999470","1999950"," A little bit more squeeze."
"2000410","2000970"," Tiny bit more. "
"2002990","2005350"," One more big ass green bar."
"2007430","2008850"," Go up there and touch it."
"2009070","2009770"," Fuck around with it. "
"2011010","2012010"," Play with it."
"2014670","2015370"," Oh."
"2021920","2024720"," Selling 92 right now. "
"2025560","2027720"," Trade 94, 96 right now."
"2028840","2030440"," I'm out and flat."
"2034930","2035950"," It's a nice trade. "
"2039210","2042050"," Squeezing, trading, hourly trigger just then."
"2043490","2045330"," Now here's the rest of it, okay?"
"2046270","2048030"," So we're on hourly trigger here."
"2048190","2052250"," You want to see a little bit of a little tiny bit of gap to close here. "
"2054210","2054909"," See that?"
"2055250","2056770"," Nice little close of the gap right there."
"2058210","2062409"," Regardless of where we go, you want to see your next target to the upside."
"2062690","2063949"," There's two things you're looking for here. "
"2065010","2067790"," You're looking for the squeeze above, right?"
"2068130","2068190"," Yeah."
"2068409","2069610"," Who we got to squeeze above, right?"
"2070449","2074449"," Can we continue to trade the six EMA all the way up and close the rest of this shit?"
"2074710","2075150"," I don't know."
"2075870","2078909"," We start consolidating here and start making our way up. "
"2078989","2086030"," We'll reenter calls again if we pull back and touch this 27 EMA in a one minute chart."
"2086969","2087370"," Right?"
"2087550","2088110"," Come back down."
"2088270","2089550"," Just bounce on that for a minute. "
"2090010","2090850"," Cool your jets."
"2091250","2093790"," You do need usually to break through the hourly trigger."
"2094370","2101050"," You typically need the help of at least the six EMA, the 27 EMA here, to get up there and"
"2101050","2102330"," trade that daily trigger above. "
"2103030","2105490"," Now we start banging it out and going up there."
"2105850","2107330"," So we're going to cool it off for a minute here."
"2108290","2109890"," Just give you a little bit of patience here for a minute. "
"2112150","2115030"," So we're going to change to a five minute chart right now."
"2117130","2118290"," U.S. stock index."
"2118870","2120570"," See if we get a pullback. "
"2120710","2122570"," We get another red bar right here."
"2122710","2123610"," 500 up there."
"2123650","2125490"," Watch this one blast up and boom. "
"2126190","2127790"," Pretty note we're off and running the upside."
"2151840","2153860"," Trading above the hourly trigger now."
"2154540","2155700"," Six EMA on its way up. "
"2169460","2170680"," Next target to the upside."
"2170680","2172040"," Four forty seven oh two."
"2172860","2174280"," Four forty seven forty eight. "
"2175000","2177080"," I've got two little boxes down here."
"2177840","2179880"," Now we've got the six EMA there."
"2180400","2182300"," I'd like to buy some of this down here though. "
"2182440","2183460"," I don't know if I get it or not."
"2183720","2184200"," We'll find out."
"2184920","2188440"," If we start racing higher, I'll start buying and chasing again. "
"2188720","2190680"," But we'll give it just a second here."
"2191740","2193480"," Watch this chart down here."
"2198640","2199740"," Nice little cross. "
"2200000","2201920"," Watch this yellow line coming up right here."
"2205180","2207500"," Let's see if we can bang on that one and take this one up."
"2213740","2215460"," Let me make a drop box in there. "
"2218360","2219380"," Right about there."
"2241070","2242510"," Hopefully you got a nice trade off that."
"2242770","2243330"," Just a pretty good trade. "
"2243770","2244290"," Pretty happy with it."
"2246830","2248490"," Yeah, theme's coming along on the website."
"2249050","2249950"," Theme on the website's badass. "
"2250330","2251010"," We got a bunch of cool."
"2251430","2254090"," Dude, there's so much cool coolness going on in the background."
"2254370","2254610"," It's insane. "
"2255810","2257670"," I can't talk about a lot of this stuff."
"2257790","2258690"," I got to keep dude."
"2258790","2259210"," I had a."
"2260130","2261710"," So I got to talk to you guys about something. "
"2263170","2264790"," I got a bunch of stuff to talk to you about."
"2265010","2265470"," Oh shoot."
"2265590","2266190"," Hold on a second here. "
"2267810","2269030"," I have to go to."
"2272310","2273090"," Hold on a second."
"2273230","2274610"," I got some stuff I got to do here in the background. "
"2274650","2275110"," Hold on."
"2277590","2279790"," I have some questions for you this morning."
"2280910","2286110"," If you are across the 5 to 10 year 5 to 20 year bombs even. "
"2286430","2287430"," I arrived here one month."
"2287650","2289630"," I was up around 5 basis points on the day."
"2290010","2297670"," I hope I'm doing this right now. "
"2297670","2298770"," I may mess up."
"2299130","2300750"," Just heads up here out there right now."
"2302730","2304190"," I hope I don't make this. "
"2304370","2305270"," I hope I don't make this wrong."
"2307570","2308070"," All right."
"2308250","2308550"," So sweet. "
"2308750","2310490"," Streamlabs is already a moderator of this channel."
"2310650","2310970"," Take a good."
"2314030","2314390"," Yeah. "
"2315530","2316490"," We got to talk about that too."
"2316650","2318350"," We got some craziness to talk about."
"2320570","2322190"," They're going to give me a dip by here or no. "
"2324190","2325490"," Bring it down just a little bit."
"2325670","2326570"," Just a little tiny bit."
"2327470","2329270"," So if you have experience. "
"2330130","2334370"," So I did a bunch of work on Streamlabs over the weekend."
"2334370","2337030"," And I have no idea what I'm doing."
"2337030","2337430"," Twitch. "
"2338910","2340070"," YouTube Streamlabs."
"2340290","2340570"," The whole."
"2341890","2343070"," Slobs by the way. "
"2343570","2344690"," That's what Slobs is."
"2344950","2347630"," You'll know what Slobs is."
"2347670","2348690"," Streamlabs OBS. "
"2349290","2357650"," So if anyone has an experience out there with Streamlabs OBS and multi streams and a bunch of"
"2357650","2357950"," widgets."
"2358770","2360970"," So I've got a bunch of like games for you to play."
"2362450","2366790"," Like games during stream, polls, all kinds of cool stuff. "
"2367410","2368510"," I'm not that good at it."
"2368830","2369870"," So I need a moderator."
"2372430","2376490"," That would preferably have experience with like at least some experience in YouTube. "
"2377270","2381490"," A lot of Twitch experience and possibly some Streamlabs experience."
"2381790","2382510"," This is a dashboard."
"2383170","2386270"," You'd have access to it and that kind of stuff to help you figure out how to do this. "
"2387210","2388690"," So if you are watching out there."
"2389450","2390650"," And you're on Twitch."
"2390890","2392810"," I'm looking at Twitch stream chat right now. "
"2393730","2399010"," If you have any of you guys have any idea how to do a show in the background technically."
"2400590","2405670"," When I could possibly pay a very small fee to get that done every month."
"2406750","2410150"," So if anyone out there has any interest in that, let me know. "
"2410770","2412410"," Mostly it's just I don't know what I'm doing."
"2412550","2416570"," I'm like, I'm going to start hitting stuff and turning it on."
"2416570","2419390"," And in the middle of the stream, the stream is going to crash. "
"2426440","2427820"," The Cooney said I'm able to help."
"2427920","2428760"," He's got a bunch of experience."
"2428980","2429560"," It's very simple. "
"2429700","2433140"," It's just like if you're watching the show, keep it on the background throughout the day."
"2433400","2435920"," Or maybe just spend an hour or two with me."
"2436160","2438940"," Some of the stuff I'm screwing up. "
"2439060","2441060"," I've watched YouTube videos and I try to do it myself."
"2441840","2443480"," It's kind of working and kind of not working."
"2448030","2450050"," Feel free to use me to satisfy your needs. "
"2450050","2452470"," There's like a giant rabbit."
"2452650","2453290"," It could grow."
"2453550","2453970"," I'll be honest. "
"2454410","2460690"," That person could grow into a pretty big position because we've got two more shows coming out."
"2462850","2465410"," It's going to get busy really fast."
"2465410","2468290"," It's going to get really busy really fast really soon. "
"2472370","2472890"," Okay."
"2473070","2473850"," She couldn't."
"2473970","2474630"," I think you. "
"2474910","2478410"," I think I either wrote your name down or I."
"2478410","2480930"," I think we talked."
"2481110","2484750"," Didn't we briefly or something or we said you said you should be in a DM or something."
"2487130","2489450"," Yeah, there's like more there than I want to talk about public. "
"2489570","2490310"," Oh, here we go again."
"2490350","2490750"," Hold on here."
"2492910","2497240"," All right. "
"2497280","2497960"," I'm back on again."
"2501760","2502120"," 447s."
"2502240","2502860"," Let's go, baby. "
"2507100","2508220"," Don't trap me in here."
"2508220","2510900"," I'm on 447s right now if you're wondering."
"2512040","2513580"," Let's see if this one will do it right here. "
"2513680","2514600"," Nice little consolidation."
"2515660","2518360"," Here rolls back down, rolls over, something like that."
"2518460","2519180"," I'll add more to it. "
"2519960","2520940"," Got a bad little place."
"2521440","2523440"," So I got some 447s on board."
"2524060","2526260"," I've got these two little little tags down here to buy. "
"2527100","2531980"," Matter of fact, now that I'm long, just right down there is where my DCAs are."
"2533560","2536340"," So if you do like a liquidation break or something."
"2537220","2537800"," Don't worry. "
"2537940","2539220"," I'll jump on that trade too."
"2544730","2545850"," We're going to talk about X."
"2548110","2549570"," We have to talk about X."
"2550810","2553690"," I was going to buy it this morning before pre-market."
"2553930","2554770"," I was like, don't do it. "
"2555350","2556350"," So I didn't do it."
"2559730","2562250"," I promised myself not to buy X."
"2564350","2570590"," I was like, because my whole thought here with X was, let's talk about X really quick."
"2572170","2573410"," We have to talk about X."
"2574070","2578110"," You can't leave X just hanging out on its own over there. "
"2580310","2582990"," You can't leave X just hanging out on its own."
"2584310","2584810"," Come on, baby."
"2585070","2585910"," Print it for me. "
"2586410","2586910"," Let's do this."
"2587170","2588830"," Let's make some fucking serious cash today."
"2588830","2590910"," I'm going to make some serious fucking money. "
"2590990","2591550"," So let's do it."
"2592610","2594350"," So we're going to talk about X really quick."
"2596230","2597390"," Run the bell this morning. "
"2597910","2598410"," Run the bell."
"2598670","2603310"," Well, four a.m. I was thinking about X and everybody's going to buy this shit."
"2604410","2606930"," And there's no fucking way they're going to give me the right price. "
"2607350","2609610"," And I own every other single letter stock but not X."
"2610110","2616330"," So I'm like, well, when we hit the bell at 9.30, do I just put some fucking leaps on"
"2616330","2616550"," X?"
"2617090","2624210"," And, of course, on the other side of my head, I'm like, you know, the most shorted stock in the"
"2624210","2627170"," world would likely be X."
"2636200","2656280"," I got"
"2656280","2658200"," to put a limit stop on the bottom on the downside."
"2661660","2665320"," So on X, you're like, does he buy a U.S. steel?"
"2665760","2667260"," Yeah, I could see him buying U.S. steel."
"2669540","2669940"," Absolutely. "
"2670240","2671140"," It's a natural progression."
"2671460","2672500"," I would say that."
"2675460","2677200"," Well, it's kind of bizarre because. "
"2678760","2684020"," You know, it's like, it's totally reminding me of a term or not terminate aliens, right?"
"2686400","2687520"," So we remind of aliens."
"2687880","2690420"," Well, because on the one side, you're like, well, he says he's going to Mars."
"2691300","2692740"," Why does he need U.S. steel?"
"2693700","2702920"," But the truth is, as a business magnet, what is he going to do?"
"2703100","2705440"," Just, you know, like, island cash and cash. "
"2705700","2706060"," Do he dies?"
"2706360","2706420"," No."
"2707720","2713680"," Yeah, I'm assuming he's got somebody out there that's saying, you know, like, start buying this and"
"2713680","2714520"," start buying that."
"2715100","2719440"," There's not much left in the world to do before you can take the bucket tomorrow and, you know,"
"2719500","2719860"," it's all gone. "
"2719860","2726480"," So, you know, start to become that company or that, that, that, that, or put that wealth to work, I"
"2726480","2726660"," guess."
"2728940","2730500"," Three trigger cluster right now."
"2730740","2731840"," We're about to explode to the upside. "
"2732920","2734120"," Price target to the upside."
"2736680","2737620"," Deli's moving up as well."
"2737880","2738420"," Looking bullish here. "
"2738780","2739140"," 447."
"2739560","2741740"," 40 upside target on spoons."
"2743340","2744380"," Put your seat belts on, please. "
"2745360","2746260"," And get ready for the ride."
"2748640","2750000"," Just a few moments here."
"2750320","2751760"," Can you see this down below here?"
"2752100","2752520"," Here you go. "
"2754320","2755480"," Here's your upside target."
"2759200","2759940"," We're right there."
"2764400","2765380"," So you can see it. "
"2767620","2768800"," Can you see that right there?"
"2775790","2777330"," But he's going to, he's going to do that stuff."
"2777750","2780950"," I think even myself, I was like, no, he's not going to buy anything."
"2780950","2785010"," He's urging a grain output boost after the flood. "
"2786670","2789370"," Yeah, he's just always going to do is he's going to go to Mars."
"2789550","2790670"," He's going to go to Mars."
"2791530","2796110"," Ticks right allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forex and stock instruments. "
"2796530","2797330"," That's not the case."
"2797330","2799250"," So it's right dot com."
"2801250","2802750"," Buying us still makes sense. "
"2805810","2808830"," And it wouldn't shock me to see him buy more than just that."
"2809650","2813710"," Trading $4.46.23 hopefully are following along and taking trades this morning."
"2814650","2824510"," Squeezing up right now, trading $0.57 on those $4.47s. Hope you're making money"
"2824510","2824850"," with me. "
"2828090","2829110"," Spoons, baby."
"2832490","2833070"," Spoons."
"2835450","2836990"," Going to be back with you guys today. "
"2841430","2842450"," It makes sense."
"2842670","2843170"," It's a natural progression."
"2843590","2847410"," I'm sure he's got some guru out there telling him, you got to put your money to work, Elon. "
"2847710","2851130"," And you got to, you know, if you're going to do all this stuff, then you're going to start buying"
"2851130","2855890"," up U.S. deal and you got to buy up, I don't know, all the power companies and all the,"
"2855890","2859730"," you know, water dams and blah, blah, blah."
"2859730","2861090"," Start buying, I don't know."
"2861790","2863290"," You already got the rocket chips. "
"2863490","2865230"," Let's get the airplane companies and that kind of stuff."
"2865630","2867970"," Start buying tire companies, you know, whatever."
"2868530","2869450"," Fuck whatever it is. "
"2871670","2872290"," Right, bro."
"2876130","2880710"," So the idea here would be Willie by X."
"2881190","2882050"," I think it's real."
"2883290","2884750"," Will it be the most shorted out there?"
"2885150","2885690"," I don't know. "
"2886590","2890250"," We're going to look though briefly at X here."
"2891170","2894290"," I think it's switch over to the trigger screen."
"2895390","2896670"," So this is X."
"2899990","2901510"," And here's X, right?"
"2901790","2903050"," So just off the open. "
"2903870","2905630"," I wanted to buy some, some leaps."
"2906130","2906590"," I'll show you that."
"2907190","2909450"," I'm like, farthest out calls and the money is possible. "
"2910210","2913050"," So here is X currently right now."
"2914330","2917710"," You know, I'm sure there's a bear out there."
"2917830","2920390"," That's like I'm going to do the half back trade. "
"2922330","2924470"," It's looking like 26 and change."
"2925730","2927210"," 26.25 ish."
"2930250","2936170"," I'd like to get some leaps down here or like not leaps, but I'm like, oh, let me go look"
"2936170","2936890"," at the option chain. "
"2937370","2938450"," It's like 930 this morning."
"2938450","2940850"," I'm like, let me go see if I can buy some X."
"2941970","2942890"," Options here, right?"
"2943430","2944610"," Type in X."
"2945630","2947810"," U.S. steel, right?"
"2954690","2956550"," And I'm like, oh, look at that."
"2958170","2962190"," Whole bunch of people out there buying, buying calls on the farthest out. "
"2962670","2965990"," On the farthest out strike farthest out expiry."
"2967250","2971610"," Whole bunch of bad boys buying 35 C for five bucks."
"2974010","2977610"," So I want to see if this goes down or any at all today. "
"2977990","2983370"," And if we can cool that off, maybe jump on their coattails back over there."
"2984370","2985070"," That's X."
"2985610","2987550"," I'm looking for a dip buy on it."
"2988450","2994510"," I'm hoping I can buy a 23 and a half something like that. "
"2995470","3000650"," And just sit on it for, I don't know, a year or two or something or however that this nonsense"
"3000650","3002070"," plays itself out."
"3003470","3004250"," So there's X."
"3020200","3022800"," Testing 27 EMA on spoos."
"3024980","3027120"," Here's that little green box buy button. "
"3061280","3063440"," So X, let me know in the chat if you're in."
"3063620","3066160"," Let me know in the chat, I guess the question would be here."
"3067400","3068160"," Do you. "
"3069640","3072560"," The question here would be, do you."
"3074440","3076680"," So the NASDAQ here in the background."
"3077540","3084110"," Do you think that's NASDAQ. "
"3086690","3088530"," Well, I got to switch over to a one minute here."
"3090950","3094890"," Do you think that NASDAQ or not NASDAQ, do you think that X."
"3095950","3099010"," Will like major shorts go on right now on X."
"3099870","3101970"," Just put a permanent short on like today."
"3101970","3108590"," Or do you think that X will just will just have that moment where it just trades like 60, 70"
"3108590","3108850"," bucks. "
"3109550","3110830"," I'll take 35."
"3120010","3122470"," Yeah, so just the heads up if you don't know this."
"3124010","3125410"," It's not just rumors. "
"3126270","3130210"," So the Cleveland Cliffs offer was one of many."
"3130990","3134290"," Some are I think I read a few though."
"3135030","3139630"," My assumption is that word broke out that Elon was going to buy X."
"3141370","3144730"," And that there are other offers placed in conjunction. "
"3147510","3152850"," Yeah, I'm not a fan of the I'm not a fan of the whole X thing for multiple reasons."
"3153370","3154430"," I'm not a bull."
"3154670","3158590"," I'm not an Elon bull, but I'm a Tesla bull and SpaceX bull. "
"3159230","3161610"," And that's the most exciting part for me at least."
"3162670","3163810"," Why would like a cap?"
"3163850","3164870"," Why would you even buy that?"
"3164950","3166390"," It's going to be shorter to the depths of hell."
"3168870","3169670"," Just watching. "
"3169910","3172050"," There's a test coming up right now for NASDAQ."
"3172290","3174710"," Just the heads up to see you guys want to see this maybe."
"3175230","3176970"," So what are you guys wondering what's going on here?"
"3179270","3180530"," Just keep with me here. "
"3181830","3183090"," Here's NASDAQ right now."
"3183770","3185010"," If you will follow down below."
"3185610","3187150"," The NASDAQ is just testing right here. "
"3187270","3187610"," It's one minute."
"3187790","3189630"," So just waiting for NASDAQ here to see what it's going to do."
"3191970","3193390"," The NASDAQ is still not. "
"3193530","3194470"," It's hourly trigger yet."
"3194770","3195790"," It's hourly trigger is way up here."
"3196470","3198150"," It's not even near it's daily. "
"3198790","3199930"," So we'll see if we get a move here."
"3203450","3204490"," See if this holds."
"3204690","3207150"," You want to see that 15.078 holds. "
"3208630","3212670"," This is a place for you to buy the dip on NASDAQ and spoos."
"3213730","3215430"," It's the natural place to buy it."
"3215450","3216470"," If I just add it to a position. "
"3216770","3219190"," So I know what I'm doing back on when I'm back here."
"3219470","3220630"," It was typing earlier."
"3231550","3232770"," Put that right there. "
"3236150","3237450"," See you can see it."
"3241500","3247280"," So my take on X is, well, of course I've got the one fear that it gets."
"3248260","3252320"," I've got the one fear that it gets shorted to the depths of hell. "
"3252320","3256320"," Now if it was just Twitter under the X moniker."
"3258340","3259820"," It's easily shortable, right?"
"3260540","3262520"," U.S. Steel."
"3266380","3268900"," It's only come down as the years have passed. "
"3270540","3273460"," Over a long, long period of time."
"3273460","3274200"," I don't want to hear a bunch of dividends."
"3274480","3276100"," I don't want to hear it. "
"3276620","3281560"," It's come down over the decades and hundreds of years."
"3282340","3289840"," So I do like the idea of SpaceX though."
"3290420","3291060"," U.S. Steel. "
"3292440","3295480"," Twitter under the same company."
"3295860","3297140"," And what else would come from that?"
"3300200","3303100"," What other companies might be taking public."
"3304700","3306140"," And then put under that moniker. "
"3308380","3310960"," So I'm hoping for a pullback in X today."
"3311140","3312240"," If I can get a pullback on X."
"3314260","3315860"," And ride that train."
"3316500","3317360"," I'm doing it. "
"3320180","3321180"," Yeah, plot twist."
"3321180","3321560"," This is the X."
"3322920","3323500"," This is the X."
"3323940","3327300"," It speeds higher again on spy."
"3331170","3332970"," Back up to 51 cents. "
"3333210","3334630"," I bought 47 and 41."
"3335270","3335970"," So we'll see."
"3349010","3352230"," Yeah, the boring company, you mean making subways. "
"3354670","3360850"," The boring company to me is very much a research for like other other, for like putting holes in"
"3360850","3361810"," the moon and Mars."
"3362730","3364070"," That makes the most sense."
"3366810","3371450"," Neuralink would probably be a negative for some period of time. "
"3373070","3375570"," Trading 58 right now on 47."
"3378610","3380430"," 60 right now."
"3384540","3394200"," Trading 4.46. Trading"
"3394200","3395560"," 63 on 47. "
"3396760","3397300"," 62."
"3398860","3408650"," Come on, baby."
"3421950","3422350"," The. "
"3424490","3426350"," I think the risk is worth it."
"3426490","3428690"," So if that's where growth is going to be, if they're going to use that moniker."
"3428950","3429650"," Now, I don't know. "
"3429790","3436570"," The one thing I don't know is the ramifications on options versus owning the stock."
"3437750","3441490"," If all this unfolds into something much, much larger."
"3442050","3444630"," It's the only details I haven't looked into. "
"3444790","3446270"," So I have to look into some of that stuff."
"3449230","3452950"," I got to check and see."
"3453250","3455990"," I don't know if I'm seeing all of the. "
"3456730","3458810"," I haven't seen a YouTube comments here."
"3463350","3465570"," Why don't I see any YouTube comments?"
"3473860","3475620"," I'm not seeing any YouTube comments."
"3475780","3477100"," I'm seeing just Twitch comments. "
"3485610","3486590"," Permeable Tom."
"3486790","3487950"," When did you comment last?"
"3491810","3493190"," I'm not seeing a."
"3494830","3496830"," David say without a straight face."
"3497650","3499850"," And someone make a comment on YouTube really quick. "
"3500590","3502350"," Anything just like testing, testing."
"3502970","3504050"," One, two, three."
"3507500","3509820"," Trading 68 right now. "
"3510320","3511380"," 69 baby."
"3520140","3521840"," 73 right now."
"3522080","3523340"," 74 right now. "
"3524860","3536540"," Hold on"
"3536540","3536860"," patience."
"3541200","3544440"," Selling 76 right now."
"3544620","3545440"," Now trading 79. "
"3546340","3546560"," 78."
"3547800","3548160"," I'm out."
"3548420","3548760"," I'm out. "
"3549720","3554640"," It's good for me."
"3557140","3557920"," I'm happy."
"3558400","3559240"," Do you think?"
"3559580","3561820"," Do you think I'd get that one last green bar?"
"3561980","3562760"," I know how you guys are. "
"3563380","3565040"," One last green bar right here."
"3568740","3569680"," I'll take it."
"3570220","3570800"," That's good. "
"3571100","3571480"," Good trades."
"3573400","3573960"," Test."
"3577160","3577320"," Okay. "
"3578420","3578700"," Nope."
"3579460","3580240"," Not seeing."
"3580440","3580560"," All right. "
"3580600","3581940"," I'm going to refresh this entire chat."
"3583480","3585640"," I'm not seeing YouTube comments right now."
"3585840","3586260"," Thanks for saying. "
"3586400","3588140"," Thanks for getting the test on YouTube."
"3590840","3592700"," Just refresh the entire chat."
"3593060","3593660"," Appreciate it. "
"3596180","3596700"," Yeah."
"3599060","3601880"," I'm looking to see if YouTube comments are coming up right now."
"3602000","3603820"," There's still not coming up, dude. "
"3604540","3611920"," What the fuck, man?"
"3611920","3612680"," No."
"3612860","3614060"," I get like Twitch to show it."
"3614300","3616780"," Twitch is blowing up on my. "
"3617160","3617840"," So don't worry."
"3617960","3620800"," I'm just going to leave you guys on the background on a separate monitor here."
"3621680","3622360"," I got you. "
"3622460","3623480"," I got your YouTube family."
"3623580","3624240"," Don't worry about it."
"3625600","3626000"," Yeah. "
"3626100","3626840"," I don't know why it's not."
"3627160","3628100"," So I got to."
"3628320","3628660"," I got to. "
"3629720","3631640"," I have a multi stream chat, right?"
"3631780","3633400"," It's like chat that rolls down in front of me."
"3635160","3637260"," And sometimes it shows YouTube and Twitch."
"3637520","3639040"," Sometimes it says fuck you. "
"3639040","3639860"," We're not doing that today."
"3641580","3641980"," So."
"3643600","3643980"," Well. "
"3648340","3650640"," So I have to open up the YouTube chat on YouTube."
"3650960","3652820"," So I got that open in the background right now."
"3653000","3654240"," So we'll read what you guys are saying. "
"3654500","3655460"," I appreciate you guys."
"3655720","3655880"," Thanks."
"3656160","3657260"," Purple Tom for saying something. "
"3658760","3659800"," Thanks, Mr. Basra."
"3665620","3666020"," Okay."
"3666260","3667960"," So I wasn't here last week. "
"3668220","3670720"," So well, I was here kind of earlier in the week, but."
"3670720","3672380"," Where in the week really wasn't here."
"3672540","3674580"," So I want to talk to you guys about something here. "
"3675200","3675900"," Silver face."
"3676140","3676300"," Okay."
"3676680","3677240"," Straight lay. "
"3677420","3677840"," Silver face."
"3680380","3682680"," All this like all this bullish."
"3683580","3685160"," This that you have at this moment. "
"3685160","3685600"," Okay."
"3686540","3689940"," I want you to be tactful as a bull or a buyer."
"3690640","3692640"," And know that as we come up here. "
"3693420","3694760"," It's going to be some resistance."
"3694820","3695300"," Okay."
"3696860","3699040"," And not only that, but you'll. "
"3699620","3700740"," Just as before."
"3701140","3702320"," We're going to talk about this."
"3702480","3702560"," Okay. "
"3706530","3708370"," So just pay attention here."
"3709230","3710770"," Maybe I'll switch over to."
"3711530","3712770"," One quick second here. "
"3715330","3717110"," So we're going to look at."
"3718430","3719490"," We're going to look at here."
"3722090","3724230"," We're going to switch over to the trigger screen. "
"3725630","3727190"," So there's more up to go."
"3727530","3730010"," I want you to know that even on spy, there's more up to go."
"3730010","3731570"," Spy is going to rip right through. "
"3732230","3735170"," Spy is going to trade 447.48 if not higher."
"3735570","3738610"," And I want you to look at now that this is NDX right now."
"3738670","3738830"," Okay. "
"3740670","3748350"," So now that is going to trade 15.1.44.08. And that's just it's hourly, not it's daily."
"3748910","3748970"," Okay."
"3749070","3749710"," I want you to see that. "
"3750270","3752050"," So there's more up to go here as well."
"3752550","3754270"," But I want you to be aware of something."
"3755450","3757150"," Now as we rip faces right now. "
"3757170","3759010"," So we're going to keep going up right now."
"3759010","3759750"," One more squeeze coming."
"3761350","3763110"," Let you guys know something out there. "
"3763430","3765610"," Like 100%."
"3765610","3767250"," See this back here?"
"3768670","3769690"," It's last Thursday."
"3770970","3773230"," You must be tactful. "
"3773690","3775490"," And not only must you be tactful."
"3776530","3778730"," But when this was rolling back down on Thursday."
"3779890","3781930"," I was like, yeah, I want to look to buy this hourly. "
"3782770","3784430"," The moment that broke, it was cut."
"3784590","3786010"," It was cut right."
"3786890","3787370"," Right?"
"3787750","3788410"," Watch it. "
"3788570","3789490"," Boom right off there."
"3789630","3790570"," Boom right off there."
"3791130","3792130"," Boom right off there. "
"3793710","3796990"," So, you know, we're looking for that same trade today, right?"
"3797950","3801550"," We're looking to see if we reject on NASDAQ up here."
"3801770","3803270"," Because this can reject as well."
"3804770","3805250"," Okay. "
"3805810","3806290"," And up here."
"3806470","3808010"," So if you're a bull, you're tactful."
"3808210","3809190"," You're in this trade. "
"3809610","3811210"," You're in this trade right here."
"3812670","3816710"," But you are not diddling in these fucking lines right here."
"3816710","3818290"," I don't know how many times I have to say that to you. "
"3819230","3823530"," You know, I was reading the chat on Thursday or Friday while the stream was going in the background"
"3823530","3826770"," and I'm like, I'm like, this is insane, sane sauce."
"3827790","3828750"," Like you're getting caught."
"3829150","3830190"," You're diddling in the middle. "
"3830530","3831830"," Like, no man's land."
"3832010","3834570"," We know what, how many shows have we done here?"
"3835450","3840650"," Where we talk about not trading or knowing where to cut if you're taking a long or a short."
"3841130","3842390"," Doesn't matter which side you're on. "
"3843630","3846190"," We're going to get spy right here for the same thing."
"3846370","3846470"," Okay."
"3846770","3851190"," So, we're going to get spy right now. "
"3852190","3854730"," Spy is going to squeeze up right here."
"3855790","3862850"," It is likely going to break above 4.47.46. But we want to see what the reaction is on"
"3862850","3864390"," NASDAQ on its early trigger."
"3865350","3868190"," So, I'm going to still expect a rejection up here. "
"3869210","3871090"," You know, try to get above it."
"3872530","3878710"," If it can consolidate and you can get some more of this stuff coming up, you can buy it for"
"3878710","3879770"," the next leg higher."
"3881610","3883190"," Just be aware of it as we come up here. "
"3883430","3885510"," We're going to pay attention to this right now and spooze."
"3887690","3891470"," Actually put it back to the main screen here."
"3894440","3896380"," So, you can see us squeezing up right now. "
"3898080","3899560"," And in this resistance here."
"3901040","3903420"," I'm going to send the S&T retrace those losses."
"3903700","3905980"," And now, in the green up around there, it's all three boxes in. "
"3906120","3907260"," I'm going to switch the bottom."
"3909990","3912550"," I'm going to switch the bottom chart to NASDAQ."
"3914070","3920550"," Because I want you to see the interplay for right here. "
"3920750","3921750"," So, this is NASDAQ."
"3923230","3925090"," And I want you to watch NDX here, right?"
"3925090","3927630"," You can see that spies coming into some resistance."
"3929610","3934230"," And NASDAQ is checking its one minute here, right?"
"3935270","3936630"," To make a move higher. "
"3937870","3941850"," So, you're going to already expect some resistance here on spooze, okay?"
"3942630","3943390"," I'm going to show you that."
"3943470","3944330"," This is NASDAQ."
"3945310","3950170"," You want to see NASDAQ hold right where it's at right here. "
"3961540","3963740"," Very bullish here on NDX."
"3965640","3967740"," Vicks getting taken to the woodshed."
"3968520","3970200"," Trying to close its gap down below. "
"3970980","3973480"," All that nonsense down here, 1492."
"4005740","4007340"," Long, 448 C's."
"4008360","4012020"," And even if we roll here, I'll probably add some more to him. "
"4012240","4015940"," So, now I've come down from 450's to 449's to 4."
"4017100","4019940"," No, excuse me, 446, 447, 448's."
"4020040","4022020"," And now I'm on 448 C."
"4023200","4023800"," And I got out."
"4024100","4027380"," I got, well, I don't have tons, but I've got a bunch of calls for Friday. "
"4027600","4033560"," So, I've got a bunch of call spreads, that kind of stuff for September, late September."
"4034400","4036280"," I'm like fucking tits loaded with calls."
"4038940","4045720"," No, I'm still on Friday calls. "
"4046580","4048440"," I'm holding those fucking things into Friday."
"4048440","4050400"," They were so fucking cheap."
"4051920","4052900"," I'm just holding them. "
"4053040","4055040"," So, they're just like lottery tickets."
"4056620","4059120"," It didn't cost me 20 grand to buy those."
"4059380","4061360"," So, they just stay in the pile. "
"4061840","4065660"," And if they print like 4,000% or something, all the better."
"4068640","4069580"," Yeah, tits loaded."
"4070060","4071020"," There's like 13 cents. "
"4071220","4073340"," I was like, bam, bam, bam."
"4073340","4074220"," I was in the phone with Joe."
"4074380","4075980"," I'm like, dude, I'm buying calls right now. "
"4076100","4077100"," And then I'm like, we'll call you back."
"4077440","4079120"," And then at the end of the day, I've added more."
"4079320","4080860"," And I'm like, you can buy calls at the end of the day, too. "
"4080980","4084900"," And he's like, I don't know if he could be added more or not, or maybe on Friday."
"4085220","4087720"," It's like Thursday, I was just loading up."
"4096760","4099000"," Yeah, I see people dead in the middle on the show. "
"4099260","4102340"," Like literally step away from the show for like 5 minutes."
"4103359","4106340"," And I'm like, these fucking people are fucking dead in the middle."
"4106939","4107600"," I'm like, what are they doing?"
"4107600","4108120"," I'm like, we do that. "
"4108220","4109740"," We go over this in the show every day."
"4114600","4118140"," I got YouTube, I got YouTube comments, finally, on my stream."
"4119880","4129689"," Yeah, I'm home till Friday. "
"4129910","4131149"," They just stayed, stay till Friday."
"4131750","4135370"," Turn them on on Thursday and sit on until Friday."
"4137810","4141090"," This is, this is called a premium picture. "
"4141090","4144750"," I don't know if you know what these are, but these are premium kick trades."
"4146830","4152550"," So like spy won't price in those moves until like the last possible moment."
"4152890","4154970"," And they just like triple or quadruple. "
"4156450","4160569"," So we have done, we've done, we've, I used to do this with a bunch of traders here like three"
"4160569","4161090"," years ago."
"4163290","4168450"," I just bought like a bunch of fucking penny fucking, not quite penny, but."
"4169710","4172189"," And then all of a sudden the premium would kick in on them. "
"4172290","4174590"," The dealers would sweep in like little gremlins in there."
"4174729","4175550"," Mark could be going down."
"4175649","4176069"," It doesn't matter. "
"4176790","4178850"," And they'll just start cranking in value."
"4186430","4186790"," Yeah."
"4187689","4189689"," So it's a, it's a retracement trade. "
"4192029","4193490"," Return to the scene of the crime trade."
"4193630","4194230"," You even look at it."
"4194410","4195290"," You just, you just hold them. "
"4198930","4199290"," Yeah."
"4199690","4202090"," So I used to, I used to do these really cool trades."
"4203070","4204850"," We'd be bottoming. "
"4206010","4208430"," Then I would start buying a bunch of."
"4209030","4215490"," So normally when you bought, if, if this is the bottom, if this is the bottom."
"4216930","4218810"," There's a moment in the bottom where. "
"4220070","4222090"," Calls of cheap calls of dirt cheap."
"4222930","4228230"," And then dealers sneaky dealers come in and start, start adding."
"4230150","4231210"," Value to calls. "
"4232070","4233450"," And most people don't notice it."
"4234110","4235970"," Everyone's focused on the doom and gloom."
"4236510","4241150"," And they start like, even though we're going, continuing to go down, the calls start going up in"
"4241150","4241430"," value. "
"4242130","4247330"," You gets like right about this point and you're like switching from panic to buy."
"4247970","4250990"," And you didn't notice that they just used a bunch of calls down here."
"4252230","4257550"," And so you're now already buying something that's up 400% from someone else owning it. "
"4257550","4260330"," And they go to like 3000% up here."
"4260930","4262370"," 4000% some stupid."
"4264410","4265910"," So that's that trade. "
"4267650","4269910"," Knock on the door to the upside right now."

"4286370","4289170"," So I actually got a fucking bit on this."

"4420840","4421360"," Okay. "
"4421720","4423180"," So what's the plan from here?"
"4423560","4425160"," Be tactful."
"4426560","4427080"," Right?"
"4427440","4428400"," Take the money here."
"4428880","4430360"," Even if it comes up a little bit more. "
"4431140","4432760"," Take a little bit of that money off the top."
"4433020","4433740"," Take some of your money rate."
"4433940","4436460"," If you're a bull, remember we're trading zones. "
"4437760","4440520"," You are not in charge of this market right now."
"4441260","4443840"," We are zone traders as bulls."
"4444360","4445460"," So you take the money and run. "
"4446240","4448840"," Don't be asking me in the fucking chat if it's time to buy calls."
"4449220","4450000"," I kid you not."
"4450140","4451040"," Don't ask me in the chat. "
"4451220","4455000"," You're getting like a three day ban if you say it's time to buy calls cap."
"4460740","4461700"," This is good."
"4464780","4465300"," Yes sir. "
"4465400","4465760"," Buy calls."
"4473240","4473600"," Okay."
"4473920","4476640"," So what are you looking for here right?"
"4476640","4481340"," We have more upside to go. "
"4481700","4482220"," How do we know that?"
"4485580","4487760"," Well kind of we have upside to go."
"4488060","4491020"," HYG has gaps, giant gaps to the upside that need to fill."
"4492320","4493680"," HYG needs to close. "
"4495360","4497540"," 74.95 from being greedy."
"4501220","4504800"," And Apple looks like big dongs right now."
"4504800","4505160"," It's too. "
"4505660","4507520"," Nasdaq looks like big dongs out there."
"4507700","4509180"," Sorry I'm trying to tell you that."
"4509620","4511240"," There's also a gap to close. "
"4514540","4518400"," We're trading 1514 right now on VIX."
"4518960","4522340"," We can easily take VIX down to the woodshed to like 1489."
"4524140","4526200"," So even if we get a roll here briefly. "
"4526620","4527340"," Let's take a look at."
"4528360","4529400"," Look yeah man."
"4530020","4530780"," Hills you. "
"4531640","4531660"," So."
"4534380","4536300"," I'm like trying to jump back in but."
"4538420","4540360"," It just wants to smash right now. "
"4542160","4543360"," So maybe patience."
"4544380","4545720"," So go to the trigger screen."
"4546960","4548460"," There's the smash right there. "
"4548620","4548740"," Boom."
"4549200","4549560"," Hulk smash."
"4550560","4552740"," Hulk now wants to smash above the daily trigger. "
"4553680","4554200"," Right."
"4554420","4555560"," So you get that quick push up."
"4557000","4558700"," Quick push up boom above. "
"4559640","4560160"," Right."
"4560420","4561580"," And then it has to consolidate."
"4562060","4563860"," Need some help from your friends down here. "
"4564760","4565080"," Right."
"4565240","4567400"," Come up here and try to take us even higher."
"4568520","4568960"," So. "
"4570060","4572420"," Why do we think we're going to smash above here too?"
"4573180","4576180"," Well because of our friend Nasdaq over here."
"4577520","4578040"," Nasdaq."
"4578960","4586740"," Now breaking above its hourly trigger and is trying to trade 15274.75. So here goes. "
"4586740","4588460"," Here goes the rip right now."
"4588960","4591120"," You're going to watch the rip right now on."
"4592940","4597020"," On spy and you're going to watch spy just start ranking here. "
"4597800","4598480"," Okay."
"4598480","4599660"," Spy is going to push up."
"4601080","4602740"," Now trading four forty seven. "
"4603860","4604540"," Sixty."
"4607280","4610780"," Pay attention to the chart down below."
"4633270","4635830"," U.S. folks extend gains to the S&P 500. "
"4635930","4637630"," Up there is four forty six percent."
"4637870","4640730"," And I think outperforming up here is about seven at nine percent."
"4641030","4643170"," Now watch this chart down below here. "
"4643650","4644130"," Okay."
"4644130","4645090"," Well that's right down here."
"4645090","4650910"," We're going to daily point to Banachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"4651130","4652530"," And right above there. "
"4652710","4654690"," So the next 15 to a half an hour."
"4655570","4657510"," I'm looking for a dip by on Nasdaq."
"4658130","4659990"," We're not as able to spy in particular. "
"4659990","4664030"," So right here where I want to keep your eye on this right here."
"4664190","4664350"," Okay."
"4664810","4666310"," You're on that right there. "
"4672620","4674060"," So here's spoons."
"4677260","4679720"," Let's take a look now for the next dip by."
"4686220","4688180"," We're going to five minute chart on spy. "
"4691540","4692900"," And right down here."
"4693120","4706940"," Five minute chart"
"4706940","4708240"," switch back to the one minute."
"4708820","4710920"," Just so you can see where I'm looking to buy. "
"4711800","4713740"," So watch these yellow boxes right here."
"4717360","4720160"," I'm going to keep my eyes on Nasdaq down here."
"4720940","4722440"," Bring this right up for you. "
"4722500","4723400"," So this is NDX."
"4724280","4725540"," That's NDX down below."
"4731500","4738660"," I'm going to look for another dip by and see what had right around 15 139 129 something like that. "
"4738720","4739440"," I can't read it from here."
"4756220","4758600"," I should also take a peek."
"4759700","4762500"," It's PayPal pumping or what?"
"4763580","4765400"," Dude fucking AT&T is down. "
"4766460","4767740"," Visa's cranking dude."
"4768980","4769240"," Visa baby."
"4771660","4774400"," PayPal up 1.76%. Fuck yeah PayPal. "
"4783680","4784900"," Transpose still down."
"4785220","4785420"," Really?"
"4785980","4786760"," God damn."
"4791360","4795080"," One second here. "
"4795880","4799860"," X-T-N-M-F-T-X-R."
"4801500","4802860"," Are you kidding me?"
"4807580","4811380"," Sorry I'm watching this is a transpose I'm watching right now."
"4811380","4813320"," Still bleeding in transportation. "
"4816820","4818980"," This is it kind of it right here right?"
"4824780","4827900"," So I'm watching transportation ETN's right now."
"4829000","4829960"," ETN's ETF's."
"4831480","4832720"," So just right here. "
"4834980","4836360"," Kind of there right now right?"
"4836620","4836800"," See it?"
"4840750","4842410"," Well let's take a look at something real quick."
"4844710","4847450"," So these are these are the transportation ETF's."
"4848430","4849710"," Reflection point right?"
"4851750","4854970"," Let me know what happened on March 10th. "
"4855490","4856330"," See it right here?"
"4858190","4861200"," You see that right there?"
"4861940","4863200"," See that right there?"
"4865580","4867660"," You need that dip by right?"
"4868600","4871040"," That dip doesn't get by what happens here."
"4871040","4872980"," Do you know what happens with spoos?"
"4873860","4874740"," Deps of hell."
"4883580","4884700"," Deps of hell. "
"4884700","4887100"," So what does that mean for spoos right?"
"4892480","4902180"," So if we're not, if we're looking at a one minute A"
"4902180","4903740"," lot of danger in your life right?"
"4904120","4907220"," Transportation expectations across a number of categories."
"4908240","4911820"," July expected rent price increase the lowest since January 2021."
"4912560","4920840"," July expected home price rise moves to 2.8% from June's 3.9%. So temporary or bullishness here as"
"4920840","4921340"," we say. "
"4925500","4930200"," Even intraday trading so if you're a bull out there I want you to know that."
"4931640","4932700"," Even if we squeeze."
"4933700","4937540"," So even if spy squeezes here because Nasdaq is going to continue higher. "
"4938500","4940520"," You get this nice big rip up here."
"4941700","4943060"," Even right here right?"
"4946320","4953500"," If Nasdaq bounces off it's hourly down here and trades it's a daily trigger up here."
"4956880","4957540"," Excuse me. "
"4958980","4961380"," So just pair with me here so watch down below."
"4962540","4965000"," If Nasdaq bounces and even trades up here."
"4966600","4969280"," And then you would see spoos go higher right?"
"4969620","4973000"," But it could just be another chance to roll it down right?"
"4974000","4975360"," Transpose week right now. "
"4977400","4981380"," Exactly so there's a lot of work here for bulls."
"4982760","4985200"," If you see bulls out there like yes."
"4986120","4986860"," Corrections over. "
"4987780","4989440"," There's nothing saying it in the background."
"4991580","4996380"," So we're not nothing saying it but there could be a giant bull trap in here right?"
"4997000","4998560"," It could be a pretty big one."
"4999120","5000480"," This is the one that trades us. "
"5001580","5003600"," This is another word of warning to you right?"
"5004160","5005780"," Trading 448, 449."
"5006960","5011240"," It could be just another warning that we're not going to trade for."
"5012160","5013320"," We're going to trade 432. "
"5015080","5017500"," It's a pretty big fucking downside move from here right?"
"5017700","5023720"," 448, 449 down to 432, 428 is a giant move down."
"5023940","5030560"," So you switch from exuberance today and tomorrow into oh shit at my pants are on fire."
"5031880","5036020"," So as a bull where we are right now. "
"5036440","5040360"," If you have no hedge in the market and you want to see the market go higher."
"5040360","5041860"," Put a hedge on right now."
"5042300","5046180"," Start buying puts up here and you'll watch the market go to 459. "
"5047620","5051600"," Hopefully there's somebody out there that's loading the fuck out of a hedge right now."
"5052400","5054560"," Sending the put call ratio out of control."
"5055580","5057420"," They'll force us higher here at least. "
"5058460","5059600"," And trade sideways."
"5061260","5064560"," The reason I bring that up too is we're going to talk about something here."
"5065280","5067320"," We're going to go back to the weevil chart. "
"5068160","5068680"," We're back on that."
"5068680","5071880"," Now I want to say I think I drew this on Saturday."
"5076080","5078660"," I don't even know if it's on this chart or not. "
"5078840","5080400"," But don't find out."
"5080880","5081320"," Yeah."
"5084520","5085400"," Oh boy. "
"5085700","5086060"," So."
"5088840","5090860"," On the Saturday chart."
"5092180","5093720"," This is SPX by the way if you don't know. "
"5099300","5106800"," You know I want to talk about this briefly with you because I was talking to people on Saturday"
"5106800","5107540"," about this."
"5109680","5110420"," In stream."
"5111460","5114520"," Not only is this an inflection point we're going to talk about this. "
"5115360","5118860"," Well a couple things I guess we'll start but I'm going to start here."
"5119580","5119740"," Right."
"5119840","5123720"," An inflection point in the market where we're actually going to trade this up in the end of"
"5123720","5123980"," quarter. "
"5123980","5126160"," So this is end of quarter right here."
"5126440","5128140"," This is end of last quarter."
"5128280","5131640"," And this is the beginning of the quarter before in March and March April. "
"5131940","5131980"," Okay."
"5134160","5135660"," So you got Q two."
"5136640","5137200"," Two three. "
"5138180","5138700"," Okay."
"5138840","5139360"," Let's start with that."
"5140640","5141840"," Second thing is. "
"5143100","5146860"," For that continuation trade up into end of Q three."
"5147720","5149020"," With that failure."
"5151140","5153180"," Just before all time highs. "
"5154260","5155620"," You can see it right here."
"5157400","5159360"," Not the failure of all time highs."
"5160080","5162280"," The failure just before all time highs. "
"5162740","5164760"," So let's look at that real quick too."
"5168730","5173150"," So this would be like the end of Q three failure right here."
"5173670","5178090"," And then this would be December 31. "
"5179010","5180790"," Either here or up here."
"5181350","5185010"," Hey you get your all time highs into the air or you have failed all time highs."
"5185190","5187270"," We have a big old correction coming up in February right. "
"5190830","5192230"," Now saying all that."
"5195230","5197810"," We're at an inflection point in the market where."
"5199610","5202230"," If the market doesn't recover. "
"5204270","5205270"," For the end of Q three."
"5206390","5208130"," Where do we reject that."
"5208730","5209510"," And wind up. "
"5210630","5211270"," At the end."
"5212690","5213330"," Of Q three."
"5214190","5216730"," And where are we right now at the halfway mark are we. "
"5217250","5217810"," Of the quarter."
"5219690","5221630"," And you know what do they want."
"5221890","5223690"," They want four two one zero and a quarter. "
"5223870","5224230"," That's what they want."
"5224350","5226330"," They want to they want to pin that number down there."
"5226990","5231190"," They want to piss all over the bull parade for this four sixty six fifty five. "
"5232110","5234050"," Four sixty six sixty five."
"5235730","5238810"," And believe it or not forty seven hundred and forty seven fifty."
"5239630","5240950"," We ain't stopping there. "
"5244230","5246670"," And just to give some perspective here."
"5249510","5250950"," If this was Q two."
"5252790","5253310"," Right. "
"5254510","5255530"," Where are we right now."
"5256950","5260090"," Right in here right we didn't actually get that dip by did we."
"5261070","5263330"," This is the rest of it right here right see it. "
"5265570","5267950"," We didn't get that dip by down there did we."
"5268750","5270570"," Now trying to fight our way back."
"5271090","5273030"," Why are we trying to fight our way back. "
"5273730","5274070"," Why."

"5350610","5350830"," Wouldn't it."
"5352930","5354930"," Right but horseshoes and hand grenades."
"5356210","5357250"," Where are we going. "

"5408200","5410340"," You don't really have any choices here do we."
"5411460","5414360"," You can kiss all this goodbye this would all be muted. "
"5414960","5417320"," And you'd likely expect even further downside."
"5418520","5419940"," If all this is muted right."
"5421980","5423340"," You don't want that failure. "
"5423920","5425640"," You're definitely not going to get that one."
"5426240","5428220"," And you're going to go to the depth steps of help."

"6282600","6284740"," Boy you missed the discussion in here. "
"6285620","6287140"," I don't know where we go with that."
"6287220","6290200"," But Matt why don't you bring our next guest and hopefully get this thing back on the track."
"6290440","6290580"," All right. "
"6290740","6295740"," So my old producer Matt Siegel is here for a few ill-fated years."
"6295780","6299060"," He worked at Bloomberg but then he moved on and is"
"6299060","6306720"," now covering."
"6306720","6313320"," Here in the studio to talk about all things Bitcoin ETF really because on Friday. "
"6314080","6320400"," The twenty one shares and arc ETF proposal was punted by the SEC."
"6320800","6325600"," They were due to decide I think by today was the deadline and they pushed that off."
"6325600","6330680"," Now they've got even more Bitcoin proposals to decide on. "
"6330940","6332420"," One of them is black rock."
"6332420","6337000"," So everybody is paying attention on the street."
"6337440","6341320"," And Matt Siegel is the man to ask what's going on at the SEC. "
"6343040","6350160"," What's going on is there seems to be a political objection to a Bitcoin ETF which is coming from"
"6350160","6351200"," the very top."
"6351480","6355880"," President Biden if you recall January twenty twenty two put out an executive order instructing all"
"6355880","6363160"," agencies to use kind of maximum levels of enforcement to bring this market to feel."
"6363900","6370540"," And the arguments against a Bitcoin ETF have become increasingly haphazard and incoherent. "
"6371260","6375000"," And now there's a very scale lawsuit against the SEC."
"6375320","6381940"," We're expecting a decision any day on that which could kind of reveal the logical time."
"6388460","6395940"," You know the importance of the SEC will say the concerns are around fraud and manipulation. "
"6396720","6399840"," And certainly there's no shortage of that in the crypto world."
"6400140","6404300"," Not that there's any shortage of that in the plain vanilla Wall Street world."
"6404300","6410620"," But you've seen some firms make moves to try and alleviate those concerns right. "
"6410820","6413620"," Including with surveillance sharing agreements."
"6414320","6415760"," Is that not far enough?"
"6416300","6416880"," Does it not come far enough?"
"6416900","6421060"," Let's start with the original objection as you know fraud and manipulation in the underlying"
"6421060","6421800"," market."
"6422240","6428120"," Well there are plenty of commodities like gold and silver and oil where the underlying commodity"
"6428120","6429500"," trading is not regulated. "
"6429500","6436580"," But once you wrap that commodity in the vehicle like an ETF then that vehicle needs to trade on the"
"6436580","6437420"," regulated exchange."
"6437840","6442500"," So we don't think that's the system consistent in how they're applying that logic."
"6443040","6450420"," Why what's the basis from your understanding of this decision coming up from the top from President"
"6450420","6451540"," Biden about crypto?"
"6451820","6454480"," What's the what is their side's fundamental issue?"
"6455240","6460960"," I think it's an issue of control right now which is playing out across the political spectrum on a"
"6460960","6462340"," range of issues. "
"6462820","6468680"," Not just crypto but it plays into the you know potential threat against the dollar as a reserve"
"6468680","6469080"," currency."
"6470240","6474560"," You know the IMF had a blog just last month they say the way to protect against the substitution of"
"6474560","6479200"," sovereign currencies is by having legitimate institutions and frankly there's just an increasing"
"6479200","6483920"," number of people around the world who are doubting the legitimacy of those institutions."
"6483920","6488500"," If BlackRock comes and says they want to need to get an ETF it's BlackRock. "
"6489260","6496040"," Just had about 35 on the final decision on the BlackRock ETF isn't doing until next March and"
"6496040","6500000"," before then there's a lot of phone calls that are going around which are not being done in a"
"6500000","6500920"," transparent manner."
"6501400","6505080"," And you have all these ETF issuers like VANAC and I think we have some authority to speak on this"
"6505080","6509360"," matter because we were the first tried by manager to first file for a physically backed ETF in"
"6509360","6509980"," 2017."
"6509980","6515500"," And we spent the last six years trying to figure out what exactly are the conditions that the"
"6515500","6519040"," regulator is looking for that will allow for the approval of such a product. "
"6519500","6522200"," Those conditions have not been laid out in any systematic way."
"6522540","6526780"," And we're going to see the result of this lawsuit great scale versus the SEC which we think will"
"6526780","6531660"," reveal that the SEC has been acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner and denying whether an"
"6531660","6536840"," app that leads to an immediate approval will have to see but we have until next March to get the"
"6536840","6537740"," answer to your question."
"6538400","6548260"," All right so I guess you're putting this at President Biden's on President Biden's desk but if we"
"6548260","6553680"," take it a level lower right Gary Gensler seems to be the one that's holding things back at least"
"6553680","6555420"," from from our perspective is that wrong. "
"6556800","6563520"," No at the SEC because he has recently or the SEC has recently I'm going to say lost a case"
"6563520","6564720"," in in the ripple."
"6591440","6592980"," Spies squeezing right now."
"6597170","6599330"," Oh yeah give me that squeeze baby. "
"6599690","6600190"," Oh yeah."
"6600970","6604830"," We got a little bit here."
"6606810","6609210"," Back down up here. "
"6610830","6612590"," Back down up there."
"6617300","6622120"," Shortly expecting the three and six month bill auction or lead with a three month bill high yield."
"6634170","6635950"," Trading 41 right now. "
"6636150","6638210"," Congratulations if you pick that trade with me."
"6651490","6653250"," See what's going on with the chat."
"6653450","6655310"," The chat is all fucked up right now. "
"6657510","6659850"," That is like not making me happy right now."
"6667750","6670370"," Trading 42 cents 43 cents."
"6674040","6675580"," Oh yeah baby. "
"6683120","6684640"," I think I'm just long here."
"6698580","6702440"," I think I'm just long here I was going to like clear it out so."
"6703860","6706880"," Still been figuring the sell button but I'm just long here so. "
"6707720","6710180"," I'm watching Nasdaq here in the background."
"6712880","6714800"," I'm missing some of your chat right now."
"6714860","6716580"," I apologize to some of you guys out there. "
"6716780","6722980"," I don't know what's going on chat today but on the trigger screen."
"6725400","6727100"," Just a note here on spoos."
"6729100","6733360"," We'll go over to Nasdaq so just be careful of you know you break up here. "
"6736320","6737200"," Roll down."
"6737520","6738640"," File and move down maybe."
"6739720","6744480"," To be aware of that down here that's your real real the real buys down here right. "
"6744700","6748160"," Even with the squeezing back down here in the real squeezes right there."
"6749460","6755160"," But I am long I haven't sold or anything like that so the reason I'm not selling is because."
"6757720","6761300"," So that is where is that four forty six thirty nine. "
"6762720","6765820"," It's because of NDX NDX looking really bullish here."
"6768480","6770300"," NDX trading above it's hourly trigger."
"6770900","6775940"," We might come back down here though you could if you see something like this right. "
"6776680","6778100"," And then you finally get to move higher."
"6779320","6784800"," Slams down here that would be spoos but with that last roll on spoos and then the actual move is"
"6784800","6785200"," right there."
"6786540","6789440"," And the target is to the upside though right here. "
"6790040","6793000"," So does roll targets right up here."
"6794020","6796120"," Fifteen two seventy four thirty one."
"6796900","6800020"," If it does roll I'll just add to that position again down here. "
"6801200","6803480"," Or that ripped that side there."
"6804080","6805240"," Either way I get some exposure."
"6807280","6811680"," Let's look at it back on a weevil full screen chart. "
"6812260","6812960"," Right here."
"6813060","6815640"," Cover ratio two seventy eight two seventy eight."
"6816000","6816860"," Here's your push. "
"6817700","6818360"," You are."
"6818620","6822180"," Forty eight hundred forty one and award thirty eight."
"6822300","6824400"," If it's all down to Fids at high. "
"6825440","6825960"," Alright."
"6826140","6826340"," The US."
"6826520","6828360"," Is going to be eight billion dollars in here. "
"6828440","6832880"," It's month bills and awards eleven spot seven three percent of Fids at high."
"6833080","6834880"," So that's where you just start breaking up boom."
"6834880","6835440"," Tag it. "
"6835800","6837140"," It rolls down."
"6838420","6838940"," DCA."
"6838940","6843000"," Okay, cool up there, cool up there. "
"6843120","6846240"," So either way, suppose you're there, suppose you're there."
"6846560","6851640"," If, let's say there's a failure, let's say we roll down here, right?"
"6853000","6854780"," And cap DCAs down here."
"6856520","6859460"," And it bleeds down, boom, boom, boom, bleed, right?"
"6860140","6865040"," There's still gonna be a moment where it comes back up and I'll either be in the green or I've"
"6865040","6870460"," only lost like, you know, 5% or something like that, maybe 10% or it actually goes to the"
"6870460","6870960"," depths of hell. "
"6871120","6879860"," So trying to be as precise as I can here."
"6884450","6886270"," For like surgical, right?"
"6887290","6895310"," About this, open for that, open for that, open for that, it does roll down on me by the dip"
"6895310","6896330"," right here."
"6897470","6903430"," Now that bleeds down, it's still get like a squeeze before it continues to roll down. "
"6904150","6908630"," Give me an out over here, by the dip, by the dip."
"6909450","6912990"," Get out here if it rolls, it begins to roll down."
"6917240","6919180"," Okay, attention to it right there. "
"6920720","6927620"," I think that's N2 right there, yep."
"6928160","6929760"," So here's N2, just so you can watch it."
"6931300","6932860"," Watch my cursor down below. "
"6933880","6935380"," You can see this arrow right there."
"6936060","6937300"," Just watching that right there."
"6941920","6944280"," Have that little green box down there. "
"6979420","6982280"," If I can switch over so you can see the other side too."
"6984500","7017930"," I feel"
"7017930","7018990"," like water's everywhere."
"7035990","7037650"," Yeah, I assume that they are. "
"7037850","7039250"," I mean, this is the place, right?"
"7041150","7043530"," If you're a seller, this is your place to sell."
"7043530","7053350"," Well, to your place to sell spa, but not N2, your place to sell N2 is above the"
"7053350","7057850"," 15, 280 on spoos."
"7058030","7064090"," If you're gonna sell a market, NASDAQ at least is still higher, it's up here somewhere. "
"7068690","7070670"," It's close though, it can grenades and horseshoes."
"7071910","7074290"," People are loading up puts here, I wouldn't blame them."
"7075690","7082130"," I'm gonna assume here that, for right where we are, people are like, hedge, hedge, hedge, hedge,"
"7082150","7083350"," hedge the stock out of the market right here. "
"7084410","7086690"," I can't blame it, I can't blame it for one to hedge right here."
"7087350","7088050"," Can't blame them."
"7094970","7096150"," This is a bull flag, isn't it?"
"7096430","7097350"," I don't think this is a bear flag. "
"7098190","7099810"," I can be wrong on that, but this looks like a bull flag."
"7102750","7104550"," That kind of looks like a bull flag to me."
"7105570","7107190"," So I hope there's like a resistance here. "
"7111990","7115890"," That was like when the bull flag turns into a bear flag though, or when it fails."
"7117330","7119770"," There's a bull flag right there that fails."
"7122410","7123870"," There's a bull flag, look at it. "
"7124010","7131430"," And then it goes like this, boom, straight to the depths of hell and you go, shit, shit, my bull"
"7131430","7132090"," flag failed."
"7132090","7132190"," No."
"7141050","7147070"," Now, like, let's be honest, I mean, you guys know we took the fucking money and ran on Thursday. "
"7147850","7149510"," We took the money and ran, we made bank."
"7150390","7154310"," We bought Wednesday low and we literally traded it to the top of Thursday."
"7155410","7157050"," And then we looked for a dip to buy on Thursday. "
"7157430","7163230"," There was no like, I saw somebody on Fintuit was like, I was, I went on Fintuit and somebody was"
"7163230","7165430"," like, yeah, we burned all those bulls."
"7165790","7167750"," And I'm like, dude, we ran from that trade."
"7167750","7169270"," We literally called the fucking top. "
"7169670","7172170"," There was one more push up and we called that top."
"7172550","7175130"," And then we waited at the hourly trigger to see if it got bought."
"7175730","7176990"," So that's what we waited for, right?"
"7177170","7177890"," Didn't happen, did it?"
"7178470","7180590"," Kept rolling down and down into the clothes. "
"7181750","7186890"," But we were looking for dips to buy, not for, like we weren't trying to be long on Thursday"
"7186890","7188030"," morning."
"7188490","7190070"," Like we were, that shit ranked."
"7191070","7192010"," It was stupid. "
"7193430","7196110"," It was like, it was like a straight line."
"7196370","7197270"," Look at this trade."
"7197610","7198910"," Like this trade was epic. "
"7200630","7202830"," Not trading on bears because bears are winning, right?"
"7203090","7205590"," But it was an epic trade."
"7205810","7208310"," It was just just as an epic trade for bears too."
"7210910","7211570"," Well, let me see. "
"7211850","7212270"," Okay."
"7212750","7215530"," All right, let's do a five minute chart, make it easy."
"7217350","7218870"," This is an epic trade right here. "
"7219050","7220450"," This was like monster moves."
"7220450","7224530"," So like we literally took this trade on the bell right up there."
"7224670","7226030"," We got out, I got out right there. "
"7226110","7228570"," Some of you guys were still in top here."
"7228730","7230010"," And of course that shit came rain."
"7230290","7231710"," This is where the hourly trigger was. "
"7232150","7233010"," They didn't buy it."
"7233110","7233890"," They didn't buy it."
"7233970","7234670"," They didn't buy it. "
"7234690","7236830"," And I'm like, now we're buying all that shit down there."
"7238530","7240910"," So, matter of fact, I bought this for next Friday."
"7241250","7242330"," I didn't buy it for this Friday. "
"7242350","7243310"," I bought it for next Friday."
"7244070","7247590"," So we'll see if I had again, bought it again this morning."
"7247590","7250830"," And so we're coming up here right now. "
"7251670","7253090"," We'll see who's right in here."
"7253330","7254610"," We'll see who's right right here."
"7254710","7259490"," Cause I think Nasdaq is telling you, wait for face ripper here. "
"7259650","7260930"," So we'll see what's up."
"7261730","7262890"," I'm here today with you."
"7263190","7264650"," I'm not in meetings today. "
"7264870","7274850"," So that's kind of a funny thought too, because this is some, this is a fireside chat time with"
"7274850","7275590"," Captain Jim James."
"7279810","7282250"," So fireside chat time with Captain Jim James."
"7282610","7285130"," So we'll do a little fireside chat with Captain James. "
"7288310","7291990"," So this actually relates to what we're doing here."
"7292170","7296850"," So I wasn't here Thursday, Friday, and personally I've got some people in the background that like,"
"7297010","7298950"," hey man, we need you like during business hours."
"7299790","7306110"," I'm like, okay, when they need me right now, just as a matter of fact, right now they're working"
"7307290","7309310"," huge right now, they're breaking their balls. "
"7310290","7314890"," And I'm watching their text messages that they're texting each other right now."
"7316210","7317950"," And I need to be there with them right now."
"7318590","7321750"," I felt so fucking horrible Thursday Friday. "
"7321750","7327690"," I'm like, man, when they took the money and ran on Thursday, I'm like, but Thursday was kind of a"
"7327690","7329590"," shit day and Friday was a shit day."
"7330810","7334010"," Now Friday was basically sideways, right?"
"7334250","7335970"," It was like a no nothing day."
"7337290","7341370"," There was no, like there was some good money we made, but it was like gonna be very tactful up"
"7341370","7346830"," and down, in my view, I felt like Thursday and Friday after I jumped off stream. "
"7347070","7350790"," I was like, I was like, probably shouldn't be trading that."
"7351550","7356770"," And having the two days off, I'm like, if I was a trader, not streaming, I probably wouldn't trade"
"7356770","7357410"," any of this garbage."

"7380850","7383270"," It's trading 45 cents right now."
"7389330","7394110"," It's trading 45 on 448s right now."
"7402470","7404350"," It's trading 45 cents. "
"7405370","7406770"," They don't want to give me the extra penny."
"7406930","7407910"," They're like, e-bag of dicks."
"7410990","7412710"," They're like, no soup for you. "
"7413910","7415610"," You got to hold long all day."
"7417090","7419990"," You got to put the risk on for the next half an hour or two hours."
"7420910","7422290"," It's key mansions and good enough here. "
"7430690","7433390"," So, I'm like, you got to be there on Monday, no matter what."
"7433510","7435290"," I'm like, I know I shouldn't be there on Monday."

"7437370","7442150"," And then Saturday show, I'm like, told people, I'll be there on Monday and Tuesday for you."
"7442590","7443790"," So I feel so fucking terrible."
"7444230","7447590"," I feel like it's my responsibility or my fault or something. "
"7448930","7450550"," Like I need an octopus or something."
"7450550","7453410"," I need a, I need a, give me that push, baby."
"7454430","7456670"," Break on through to the other side. "
"7456910","7457010"," Yeah."
"7460430","7460870"," So."
"7462210","7463670"," I'm like, I'll be there on Monday. "
"7463970","7466750"," Now, I got a crazy story to tell you."
"7469030","7470490"," Pass like week or two."
"7472410","7473990"," This is the fireside chat part. "
"7474970","7476230"," It's a past week or two."
"7478190","7480590"," Uh, we're sitting and looking up in the background."
"7480590","7484550"," Cause I had a, I had, you know, you're like, if something's wrong, you go to WebMD. "
"7488390","7490330"," Past week or two, as we're getting closer."
"7492430","7502310"," Um, I was getting closer."
"7502570","7504190"," I'm being, um, introspective. "
"7505990","7506350"," And."
"7508850","7509650"," Yeah, that's what it's called."
"7510930","7513450"," I've had like a bit of imposter syndrome. "
"7515630","7519930"," Past couple of weeks and I've been trying to deal with it, deal with it for."
"7520790","7525890"," Uh, it started like two weeks ago, only started to recognize it, yeah, recently."
"7528530","7533710"," And, um, so I'm like, I think I got imposter syndrome. "
"7533710","7536510"," So I looked it up and I'm like, yeah, that's it right there."
"7537030","7542790"," So, you know, it's fascinating is that, uh, I went to counseling."
"7543610","7553090"," Uh, for PTSD and I spent, uh, I think almost two years going, never in my life, uh, like, well,"
"7553230","7555910"," I, but hat was required to do it in the army a couple of times. "
"7556670","7560490"," And then, uh, just buried that shit as deep down as a possibly could."
"7562450","7563850"," And I'm looking at it right now."
"7563950","7567270"," I'm looking at, uh, like the definitions and all that kind of stuff. "
"7567490","7567710"," So."
"7568650","7569810"," I was like, um."
"7572030","7573290"," I never dealt with PTSD. "
"7574090","7576830"," And, uh, so I had some other things happen in my life too."
"7577470","7578490"," I came to find out."
"7578810","7584970"," So I had some other, wasn't a, uh, I had someone try to kill me one time when I was"
"7584970","7586410"," 19 years old. "
"7587210","7589110"," I went to prison for a long, very long time."
"7589550","7590710"," I was a guy that was driving."
"7593530","7596770"," And, uh, I was on a motorcycle that tried to kill me. "
"7597110","7598430"," He was all fucked up on pills or something."
"7598430","7602030"," I pissed them off the highway, chased me down, ran me off the road."
"7602930","7606770"," Uh, I didn't realize that that was kind of like, um, that's very similar. "
"7607010","7608670"," Not exactly sexual assault, but it's very similar."
"7609130","7611650"," It has to do with like someone having power over you."
"7614690","7616770"," Um, and, uh, you not be able to make a choice. "
"7617930","7619290"," Or fight for yourself."
"7619550","7620310"," It's a very key point here."
"7620410","7625710"," It's like, uh, if, if, um, if, uh, my clone was fighting me. "
"7626550","7628190"," We both were just fistic confident."
"7628470","7629850"," It could be an equal match, right?"
"7630130","7631210"," And we both want to fight each other."
"7631810","7635470"," Like when you have like one person wanting to fight and the other person not wanting to fight. "
"7636570","7640050"," And one person has an extreme advantage over you."
"7641170","7642290"," It really fucks with you."
"7642550","7643530"," Like fucks with you in the head. "
"7643750","7645530"," So if you like ticked with our dreams, all this kind of stuff."
"7646150","7651370"," Now if you could, if you want and can fight on the same level playing field, oftentimes, uh, PTSD"
"7651370","7652750"," doesn't accompany."
"7653550","7657470"," Well, those experiences, uh, when you're, when you have power, right?"
"7657570","7658530"," At least have power of choice. "
"7658870","7660070"," And you're like, I want to do this too."
"7660590","7662310"," Let me go outside and fuck you up."
"7662690","7662770"," Right?"
"7663250","7665070"," Uh, it's not as bad. "
"7665630","7667490"," Uh, oftentimes the military is like that too."
"7667670","7670090"," Where you have like a, you're going to be okay, right?"
"7671630","7673030"," Train 48 right now."
"7673870","7675230"," Still long calls. "
"7676630","7678530"," Break old through to the other side."
"7678670","7680650"," You're going to see one more role right here as you come up here."
"7680650","7681630"," Right here. "
"7682130","7683990"," And then the bigger move will come afterwards."
"7685330","7686990"," You're going to see it come right up here."
"7687390","7688630"," A little bit of a failure right there. "
"7688710","7690650"," You likely, uh, and then you'll get the push higher."
"7691550","7692730"," Just stay with me here."
"7694750","7697670"," So, uh, I went for like two years. "
"7698010","7704770"," I was like, I need to go to, uh, I forget if she was a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but,"
"7704770","7709510"," uh, went to counseling and, uh, oh, yeah."
"7710830","7713970"," Right in 57 cents right now."
"7715510","7717210"," 58 cents right now. "
"7721090","7722310"," You taking the money here?"
"7722330","7723910"," It's going to roll and then bounce to go higher."
"7724590","7726570"," I was thinking I might just sit on these fucking things."
"7727730","7728850"," I'll just sit on them. "
"7729230","7730390"," I'm not going to sell them."
"7730530","7731510"," Just going to stay long here."
"7733090","7735150"," So, well, I went like I used to do yoga. "
"7735350","7735910"," I never did yoga."
"7736270","7737390"," I went back to doing yoga again."
"7737390","7746330"," Um, the person I went to counseling, she was actually a daughter of an Iraqi national. "
"7747930","7749910"," So there's a bunch of sift through."
"7750090","7752970"," I think she had a bunch of sift through as well and, um."
"7760860","7762800"," And then, uh, so I did all that, right?"
"7763060","7765540"," And then, um, they kind of helped me all my life. "
"7765800","7768840"," I only got to say, uh, and none of this was through the VA or anything."
"7768980","7769700"," This is just like private."
"7770440","7772080"," You want nothing to do with the VA. "
"7773500","7775460"," And, uh, so they, so."
"7777520","7779100"," I don't know if I need to go back to a counselor."
"7779300","7780080"," I think I might have to. "
"7780900","7785800"," Uh, cause I'm, of course, over the weekend, I'm self-diagnosing myself on WebMD."
"7787020","7788560"," And that's never the way to do that."
"7788660","7790140"," That's not never the thing to do is it. "
"7790660","7793760"," And, uh, of course you have to."
"7795320","7796940"," This yellow box is now up here."
"7801810","7802970"," Green box up here. "
"7815980","7820820"," So I don't want to do like the WebMD stuff where like there has to do with like."
"7821640","7824240"," I think what it's coming from is, um."
"7826120","7830160"," And a Nate wants to, uh, build something, grow something. "
"7830320","7833860"," And then when you get to that point where, um, it feels like it's there."
"7834460","7835660"," So you get like this, um."
"7835660","7841540"," Like, lots of self-doubt and lots, lots of want to like move on and, uh, do something different. "
"7842940","7844240"," This is a really weird feeling."
"7844820","7850880"," Uh, not, not never, but had this feeling before, but not play like this."
"7851120","7851220"," So. "
"7855180","7857760"," Yeah, the rabbit hole of self-diagnosis, not good."
"7863830","7865870"," Two trigger bull cluster right now on spy."
"7868030","7872190"," Four trigger hourly cluster bull huge bullish. "
"7873650","7874430"," Not ndx."
"7875350","7876050"," You can see it."
"7876190","7878730"," One, two, three, four triggers. "
"7883390","7886590"," They're all screaming higher half an hour is kind of leaving behind right here."
"7886590","7887370"," Don't like seeing this."
"7888210","7889950"," Kind of flat in now, but we'll see. "
"7891030","7892150"," Still long right now."
"7894990","7896650"," I'm going to capture that right here."
"7901850","7907990"," So yeah, doing the, um, doing the self-diagnosis, doing the right thing, doing the right thing is"
"7907990","7908910"," some more to be committed to. "
"7909790","7913890"," Like long time committed in like five years, 10 years, 15 years, like all kinds of like."
"7916710","7918710"," And then like, I always have this."
"7920390","7923570"," I'm like, I'm not, uh, I don't know if I call myself a helper. "
"7924570","7925730"," I'm like a, um."
"7931090","7933370"," Like not good enough, like, um."
"7935590","7936670"," No, it's not good enough. "
"7936850","7937070"," It's weird."
"7937390","7942130"," It's the same way with my, my, my wife and children."
"7942130","7943730"," Like I can see it in my own life. "
"7943730","7954910"," Like, um, like a, uh, try to give as best you can and never feel like it's the, like"
"7954910","7956010"," doubt in that, like."
"7957930","7958490"," I don't know."
"7958710","7959590"," It's a really fucked up thing. "
"7959970","7961190"," I don't know why I have it in my brain."
"7983200","7983640"," Yeah."
"7984160","7985540"," Um, the imposter syndrome is bad man. "
"7985660","7987540"," I'm, I'm, I'm, it's raging right now."
"7987660","7989440"," I'm having a real like tough go of it."
"7989800","7991780"," I felt better on Saturday and Sunday. "
"7992880","7994760"," Um, Saturday and Sunday felt better."
"7995780","7999660"," Um, well, you started to read about it on Friday and like, in a Saturday, Sunday."
"7999880","8002200"," I talked to my wife about it. "
"8002280","8004360"," I was like, told her about it, about this."
"8007260","8009180"," I'm just waiting for a catch up here."
"8010200","8014040"," Just waiting for the, uh, one in five minutes to catch up to spoos. "
"8014640","8016620"," Are at least coming higher right now from underneath."
"8018720","8020600"," Are at least, are at least coming up here."
"8021780","8023540"," Yeah, just leave that so it's not in the way. "
"8023640","8025040"," I really figure starting to come up here."
"8025360","8027500"," Going to go a little bit higher here, catching up."
"8029400","8035820"," The really weird thing because, uh, the feeling is, um, the, this is how fucked up the feeling is. "
"8036340","8041700"," The feeling is like, uh, you do what you wanted to do, walk away."
"8042640","8043420"," That's the feeling."
"8043800","8046000"," I don't know if I should be honest about that, but. "
"8047180","8057330"," It's a really, it's a really, it's a really crazy feeling like it, um, yeah,"
"8057370","8064010"," I don't want to remind me of, it reminds me of like, um, reminds me of like, um, with my"
"8064010","8064670"," kids, right?"
"8065050","8069470"," Uh, like I'll spend time with my kids and be like, let's learn how to do this."
"8070290","8075290"," And so we'll go through, we'll do all these steps for them to learn until they're, uh, competent."
"8077610","8081910"," And, uh, then once they're competent, I'm like, okay, we did that, right?"
"8082630","8083550"," Do you feel good with this?"
"8083690","8084690"," They're like, I feel great, daddy. "
"8085250","8086030"," I'm like, all right."
"8086450","8088870"," And then it's on to the next thing to teach them."
"8090110","8092370"," And, uh, you don't revisit it too much. "
"8092650","8094590"," Normally I'll come back and be like, all right."
"8095330","8096730"," I want to see that you still not to do this."
"8097150","8101670"," We would try to think of anything that, uh, not tying would be a great example. "
"8102090","8104850"," Or, uh, we learned Spanish together."
"8105030","8106310"," We learned how to play guitar together."
"8107090","8107890"," All that kind of stuff. "
"8108130","8112310"," So it was like, so, yeah, let's see, you kind of move on from that next thing."
"8112310","8119630"," And, um, do I want to, do I want to become like a huge Spanish speaker?"
"8119890","8121510"," Hopefully if I live in another Spanish country, yeah."
"8121670","8125290"," But, uh, do I want to like go to Spanish one, two, three and beyond?"
"8125810","8125830"," No. "
"8127570","8134070"," Not no, but, you know, you get this feeling like I did what I was supposed to do."
"8134490","8136030"," And let's move on to the next thing."
"8137090","8137510"," Anyways. "
"8138430","8143610"," Uh, and what if I took Spanish four and five and failed, right?"
"8144250","8145710"," It was like, oh, it's self doubt, right?"
"8159600","8162300"," Uh, no, I don't know what Dunning Krueger is."
"8162400","8162840"," I'll look it up."
"8163600","8165100"," I know nothing about Dunning Krueger. "
"8166700","8170960"," Uh, but I'll look it up."
"8175300","8176280"," No, I didn't see the tweet."
"8176800","8180260"," Uh, I'm not on, well, I've got a tweet deck open, but it's only set to news. "
"8181120","8182080"," So I didn't see his tweet."
"8182200","8182500"," What do you say?"
"8182660","8183560"," Let me know in the chat what he said."
"8189860","8190220"," Yeah. "
"8190440","8192340"," I haven't looked at a, that is sweet."
"8193379","8194420"," I haven't been to it much."
"8194940","8195959"," I don't have a time right now. "
"8196200","8197040"," It's mostly time."

"8278639","8279959"," We started homeschooling."
"8280959","8283020"," So we're like, she has to go back to school. "
"8283480","8284760"," We're like, she's too young."
"8285139","8287260"," She, you can't like remove her from the school."
"8288120","8289100"," I think she was seven. "
"8290020","8291540"," Maybe, maybe younger, six or seven."
"8292500","8294020"," Just that COVID years, man."
"8294139","8295120"," It's like a, it's like a black hole. "
"8295900","8299500"," Um, but she spent a lot of time, uh, schooling at home with us."
"8299879","8301020"," Now we do a great job."
"8301160","8303760"," We have a dedicated teacher, dedicated online teacher. "

"8311959","8312900"," Is this looking weak to you?"
"8313139","8314459"," Cause this is about to rip the upside. "
"8315440","8320719"," Um, sorry, like, we get great job with it, but she has to be socialized."
"8320860","8326320"," You can't, can't have like, for me personally, I'm like, can't have this child not have, um, any of"
"8326320","8327299"," that, any of that experience."
"8327600","8330719"," My youngest one, my oldest one has had a lot of those experiences. "
"8331900","8334020"," My oldest one was getting inside."
"8334120","8335219"," I'm going to add this right now."
"8341670","8344590"," I'm still up big in the trade, but I just added more calls on spy. "
"8346650","8349410"," Uh, Nasdaq's about to explode to the upside."
"8352270","8356580"," I'm loading up right now."
"8356840","8360420"," Now the, the oldest one was coming into her high school years. "
"8360879","8362620"," So she was in seventh eighth grade."
"8364080","8365940"," And she was doing excellent, right?"
"8365940","8367240"," Uh, she was in all plays."
"8367260","8370540"," She was this, that and everything on her is all this, like, craziness. "
"8371600","8373059"," She started homeschooling."
"8373280","8375420"," And these kids, my kids, right?"
"8376180","8377139"," They have, like, dominated."
"8377760","8384500"," They have, like, they have, they're all, they're like, my oldest could probably graduate high"
"8384500","8388280"," school, uh, next summer if she wanted to. "
"8388900","8390220"," And she's only a sophomore."
"8390220","8395720"," And she could, she could graduate in her junior year of high school easily."
"8396020","8400220"," She could probably graduate, uh, the end of her sophomore year if she wanted to. "
"8400980","8404600"," But she's not in a real school, well, she's in a real school, but she's, you know, homeschooled."
"8407860","8411440"," So she's looking, so my youngest is looking to go back to school to socialize."
"8411620","8413140"," So we got her back into regular school. "
"8413720","8416560"," She starts up in the next couple of weeks."
"8419400","8423240"," And she is, um, dude, why are they, what, what's with all this drama?"
"8423520","8426540"," What are you going to do, send, seeing us send spy down to the depths of hell and make that,"
"8426600","8427360"," is that go to the moon?"
"8429040","8430880"," What are they trying to do here in spoos?"
"8432760","8434040"," They're out of their minds right here."
"8445500","8446960"," I'm adding some more right here. "
"8453750","8455770"," Got the fucking 200 contracts now."
"8458150","8463090"," So my oldest daughter, uh, over my youngest, I was going back to school to socialize."
"8463230","8465970"," My oldest daughter was like, Hey, I want to go back to school too. "
"8467330","8470910"," And I was like, look, I was like, if you go, I was like, if the youngest one goes back"
"8470910","8471290"," to school."
"8472210","8475830"," We're likely going to get some, um, we're likely going to get COVID in the house."
"8476250","8480550"," You guys think COVID is nothing but we've never had it that we know of. "
"8480550","8485970"," Uh, we don't, we actually take a test for the, uh, whatever the, like shows that you've caught it."
"8485970","8487510"," We've never, we've always come back together."
"8487710","8488230"," I think we did place. "
"8489830","8491530"," Um, but we're like, yeah, our daughter."
"8492830","8495550"," We're like our youngest is going to go back to school."
"8499390","8501950"," There's likely no reason why the oldest couldn't go back. "
"8502770","8504930"," So the oldest is like, well, I want to go back to school."
"8505190","8505990"," And I'm like, all right, cool."
"8507270","8508810"," I'm like, you want to go back to school too. "
"8508890","8512750"," So she applies, does a bunch of testing and all this stuff."
"8513770","8514610"," And she gets accepted."
"8516110","8520990"," And, uh, she's accepted and honors everything or AP or whatever it is, whatever they call it in her"
"8520990","8521250"," school. "
"8522510","8525030"," And, uh, so she's like, all right, I'm going to go to the school."
"8525170","8525510"," I'm like, okay."
"8526630","8528190"," So this is the oldest now, right?"
"8528650","8529570"," So youngest is plump. "
"8529810","8531130"," Youngest is still a child."
"8531970","8532630"," The youngest is like."
"8533410","8537810"," You know, we make all these friends with people, person, blah, blah, very, very extrovert, very"
"8537810","8538290"," extrovert. "
"8539130","8543390"," My, uh, my, my youngest one is like, uh, I'll climb any mountain with you."
"8544170","8548710"," I ski, I ski off-trail with this kid."
"8548710","8549250"," This dream is false. "
"8549430","8550770"," It makes you sick, lay on this."
"8550950","8556030"," It's three daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at the tick."
"8556450","8560530"," We've got carobes at the top of the mountain, like, we don't care where we go. "
"8561550","8562070"," Go to Alta."
"8562270","8566750"," We can go to any mountain in North America, any mountain in North America."
"8567410","8568630"," I'd ski talkerwinds with her. "
"8569170","8571350"," No, it's getting anywhere that kid will ski anywhere."
"8571850","8574370"," That kid has no fair, like the youngest, no fair."
"8574770","8576810"," Just, like, she's got a little bit of me, a little bit of mom. "
"8577130","8578750"," The oldest one's got a little bit of me, a little bit of mom."
"8578990","8579530"," They're both opposite."
"8580290","8585090"," The older one, uh, is like the exact opposite of the younger one. "
"8585290","8588570"," So every time you think you're doing something for your kids, you're like, all right."
"8588870","8593790"," So I got two different children, uh, absolutely different kids, different needs, different wants."
"8595550","8601730"," So my oldest, um, is like, in my, in my oldest, she, she, uh, she, uh, was, she was like,"
"8601830","8602550"," coming to her teenage years. "
"8603070","8604970"," And I'm like, well, you don't have to go back to school."
"8605130","8607310"," My teenage years for a girl are brutal."
"8607810","8608310"," They're not easy. "
"8608610","8615830"," Like, being a woman, uh, coming into womanhood and going through, like, uh, high school and puberty"
"8615830","8620310"," and, like, there's like a, there's like a block of time in there if you're a young woman, where it"
"8620310","8624730"," can be a real challenge for, for, for a woman, a young woman, uh, that they go through."
"8626010","8628570"," And so I was like, yeah, if she doesn't want to go through that, I don't blame her."
"8628570","8633170"," She has, there's like some, there's some argument there where, yeah, she should have those"
"8633170","8637110"," experiences so she can, uh, learn coping skills as she gets older. "
"8638230","8644890"," Uh, there's another argument there too where, um, if she doesn't, uh, accept that stuff in her"
"8644890","8646490"," life, she doesn't have to, you know."
"8647230","8653390"," Um, if she knows how she's supposed to be treated and, and what good life we're living is, once she"
"8653390","8656270"," gets into her adulthood, uh, there's no expectation."
"8656650","8658390"," Oh, yeah, I was treated like shit. "
"8659190","8661630"," Well, when I was a teenager, I'm going to accept it as an adult."
"8661790","8669540"," So there's another argument there saying, uh, saying, uh, maybe she doesn't have to experience that"
"8669540","8669720"," stuff."
"8669880","8671400"," Now, so then I want to go back to school. "
"8671620","8676560"," So, um, just, in all these, except in all these AP classes."
"8678080","8678440"," No."
"8679720","8680640"," Hey, what's up, buddy?"
"8681940","8683060"," Hey, you doing handsome boy. "
"8683260","8684080"," I love you too."
"8684240","8684920"," You dirty dog."
"8686200","8688140"," Don't cut away the fly. "
"8690240","8690640"," So."
"8693940","8695020"," What's his next scratch?"
"8695720","8697180"," So the, so the oldest one."
"8698380","8702140"," As far as I know, uh, I know nothing. "
"8702260","8702880"," I'm not told anything."
"8704060","8706360"," And I go and check back yesterday and check back."
"8706580","8710420"," My, my, my, so I'm a man that lives in a house with a bunch of women. "
"8711320","8713640"," So I don't get told a lot."
"8713640","8718120"," Um, now and I didn't get told a lot, but they like to make their decisions with them."
"8718120","8723840"," And the more secretive that they are, the more the big decisions they're, I was like, but I really"
"8723840","8724560"," don't tell daddy. "
"8726580","8729140"," This is a woman's house and we're in charge here."
"8732860","8736200"," Now that statement can be made from any one of my children or why."
"8738400","8740640"," Uh, that doesn't matter which one of them it is. "
"8741140","8741900"," Don't tell daddy."
"8742960","8746300"," We'll just do it and then we'll ask for forgiveness later."
"8753900","8760040"," So I'm like, so unless I go out and put the probes out as like probe, like, Hey, what's going"
"8760040","8761860"," on with this or Hey, what's going on with that?"
"8761980","8762640"," Just check it in. "
"8763120","8764980"," Haven't heard anything in two weeks or a week."
"8766420","8770100"," So if it probes out and the wife says to me."
"8772000","8774100"," Um, now we prepared for school. "
"8775660","8779540"," But close this, that and everything through all the motions, all the good things."
"8780880","8785300"," And my, my oldest is saying, I don't know if I want to go back to school in person."
"8786960","8790520"," And she, my wife told me that she, my wife told me she goes. "
"8791860","8795780"," She goes, she feels like she can get better classes."
"8796560","8800080"," Then in person is more offering."
"8800360","8805320"," There's like a bunch of smart kids stuff that like the breadth of offerings. "
"8805920","8810300"," And then she can take more classes than they offer at high school."
"8811180","8818700"," She can actually load up and get a bunch of stuff for college out of the way."
"8819100","8821460"," And so when it comes time for college. "
"8821460","8824940"," Uh, she'll be more prepared."
"8825520","8828340"," Her positive supposedly is my wife and daughter talking."
"8828840","8830280"," So I don't know who this is coming from. "
"8830780","8833940"," And she's like, uh, that she's going to have a better."
"8835500","8840780"," Or, or be more prepared for, um, entry into university and college."
"8841160","8844960"," If she continues to own school, she's got tutors and all that kind of stuff. "
"8845100","8845860"," It's like all bad ass."
"8845980","8847400"," We do like labs and stuff."
"8847580","8850380"," We buy, uh, whatever she needs and stuff like that. "
"8850380","8852540"," So, well, I don't know what to do here."
"8853300","8855880"," So I haven't spoken to my oldest daughter yet."
"8856880","8865180"," Uh, and of course I want to be, well, I want to ask her like, you know, are you like,"
"8865180","8869780"," it would be normal to have fear to go back to in person learning or go back to our high"
"8869780","8870020"," school. "
"8870720","8872620"," Um, be nervous about it."
"8873580","8877380"," That's be, it's normal to, um, have apprehension."
"8879120","8882160"," And, uh, you know, like, oh, maybe I don't want to go back to school. "
"8882840","8884980"," Cause I don't know if it's because of what she's saying."
"8885860","8891440"," Or if she's using that as a logical, uh, reason for why she doesn't want to go back to school."
"8891600","8893040"," If it has more to do with fear. "
"8893820","8894680"," So I don't know what to do."
"8894740","8897280"," I don't know if I should, I don't know how to approach it whether at this point."
"8898200","8904520"," Um, because if it's something that has to do with like, um, With like apprehension, I don't want"
"8904520","8906140"," that to carry over into her adult life. "
"8906320","8906340"," Right."
"8906460","8910900"," I want her to, uh, be an adult and know that she's going to have to take chances and risk."
"8911640","8915360"," Impossible failure and that kind of stuff and be able to cope with that stuff. "
"8917660","8920140"," Um, and not just say, well, it worked this time."
"8920140","8923580"," And, you know, it'll work the next time to say I'm not comfortable doing that."
"8929400","8933060"," Yeah, I'm like, I hope I hope my kids take care of me. "
"8933820","8934620"," Hope they do."
"8936660","8938040"," That's the other side of it too, right?"
"8938160","8942000"," The other side of is like, well, if she doesn't want to go to school, so all the more time"
"8942000","8945720"," she can rely upon her dad and never leave and piss off some other guy someday."
"8946380","8948380"," But the truth is she's getting older, right?"
"8948840","8949480"," She's growing up. "
"8951680","8953840"," And she needs to like, um, I don't know."
"8954280","8956500"," It's like part of cutting the cutting the."
"8957800","8960720"," It's part of like letting them start to grow up, right?"
"8961260","8963880"," Part of that where you need them to grow up. "
"8964480","8965500"," You'll take care of me."
"8967120","8968460"," That'll make kids throw me in a home."
"8970340","8971540"," I wouldn't doubt that either. "
"8971820","8972520"," They learn from their mom."
"8976020","8977100"," I always make those jokes."
"8977380","8979420"," I'm always like, they're just waiting for me to die. "
"8979640","8980280"," They're like, what do you want to do?"
"8980520","8980840"," Some stressful?"
"8981200","8981720"," Have at it, buddy."
"8982640","8987020"," As soon as you go, the better girls and I can take off and do whatever we want to do."
"8987040","8987940"," You want to be stressed out?"
"8988640","8988840"," Fuck. "
"8988840","8989620"," Yeah, I do it."
"8992240","8994440"," We don't want no healthy men around here."
"8994640","8996040"," We want unhealthy men. "
"9001280","9002080"," Too funny."
"9008030","9010930"," Let me just take a peek over here and see what that number is right now."
"9013810","9016590"," 446 22 moving up a little bit up there now. "
"9019190","9020930"," Trying to roll us down here still."
"9026930","9028690"," Go back to Nasdaq."
"9029090","9030790"," Nasdaq still motion. "
"9031150","9033090"," Let me go switch over real quick so you guys can see this."
"9037680","9039420"," This is what I'm watching in the background."
"9040900","9042200"," It's actually a different screener. "
"9046600","9047960"," I'm just watching this here."
"9049240","9050760"," This is Nasdaq, baby."
"9050760","9058780"," And for all the doom and gloom that Spy looks like right now, you know, it's just like grind,"
"9059000","9060740"," grind, grind, grind, push up higher. "
"9062420","9065200"," It's any kind of like doom that you're seeing right now on spoos."
"9066140","9067200"," Nasdaq's not showing that."
"9067920","9069840"," Just waiting for this stuff to come up and push it up higher. "
"9070200","9073920"," So we'll switch back over to the main screen."
"9074820","9075840"," There's a little bit of doom here, right?"
"9076060","9076980"," See all this doom right here?"
"9080880","9086920"," This looks pretty bad, but the truth, Nasdaq's not not looking as doomy as this is."
"9087440","9088620"," Just waiting for the squeeze. "
"9093400","9102980"," If Nasdaq does decide to roll over anything, I'll cut my calls, but otherwise I'm just here adding."
"9103760","9105380"," So any kind of doom you can bring down here."
"9106200","9106940"," It comes down here. "
"9106940","9107580"," I'll add here."
"9107800","9108900"," I really don't care."
"9110860","9120500"," I bought this bar back here, right there, I bought that bar. "
"9121200","9123600"," So I'll buy this bar right here, buy that bar down there."
"9125620","9128640"," So the kids, so the oldest that I have to have a talk with her today, I have to be"
"9128640","9134320"," like, if this conversation we're going to have today where I'm going to ask her and I don't want to"
"9134320","9137200"," be patient with her because our feelings matter."
"9138220","9145100"," If she has fear, maybe it's not really the loading up on classes, maybe she has real apprehension. "
"9147920","9150900"," I'm going to end up owning like every call on 448."
"9153460","9163320"," Just a couple more pennies there, a couple"
"9163320","9164020"," more pennies."
"9181090","9182610"," Hey, look, it's quite a stink pit. "
"9193410","9195130"," All right, I got a stink pit in now."
"9204390","9205950"," I don't think I'm going to get a fill here."
"9218980","9226680"," Give me fucking three more pennies, three pennies, two pennies. "
"9237260","9243500"," So the oldest is like, two more pennies, please."
"9256060","9260280"," So the oldest is, I don't know if it's because of the actual classes or the workload."
"9260940","9262020"," One more penny, give me one more penny. "
"9262640","9263500"," Come on down, just a little bit more."
"9274640","9317770"," Still haven't bought a little bit"
"9317770","9318090"," more."
"9319670","9321390"," You got to see Nasdaq down there. "
"9327460","9337240"," So my oldest,"
"9337720","9342440"," if that's the real reason that I'm kind of like, yeah, no big deal."
"9343900","9349480"," If the reason is because she's apprehensive, going back to high school, maybe having bad"
"9349480","9349720"," experience."
"9350080","9351440"," Nope, I didn't buy that. "
"9355780","9357360"," A little tiny bit more here."
"9359940","9360780"," One more bar."
"9362360","9367760"," One more bar. "
"9386330","9388390"," I'm going to trade in 29 right now."
"9390430","9396190"," I'm going to buy that bar and I didn't."
"9436970","9438410"," Ooh, 26 dude. "
"9459280","9460120"," How about that?"

"10738610","10739730"," So we do homeschool. "
"10740050","10743150"," Now, the responsibility of that is brutal."
"10744410","10745650"," You're taking them traveling."
"10745970","10747010"," You're taking them out and about. "
"10747330","10749130"," You're doing the science projects with them."
"10749130","10752070"," You're doing an applied math with kids."
"10753770","10754730"," We travel. "
"10755410","10758170"," So on the weekends, whenever you guys are like, I'm a wife's gun."
"10758770","10759630"," Or she's got her plans."
"10760210","10762690"," It's like my kids have set schedules year round. "
"10764370","10767410"," Where they go and meet other people."
"10767650","10768470"," Like kids their age."
"10770050","10771150"," It's a pain in the ass. "
"10771390","10772070"," It's not easy."
"10772590","10772910"," It's brutal."
"10773250","10773710"," They play sports. "
"10774090","10774970"," They do all that kind of stuff."
"10777840","10779600"," Like not all homeschooling."
"10779700","10780920"," I guess some of it is. "
"10781060","10783180"," There's multiple reasons for homeschooling."
"10783460","10788120"," Some kids get the fit what they need from homeschooling that they can't get in a regular school"
"10788120","10788380"," environment."
"10788780","10790200"," Some kids don't do well in a school environment. "
"10790200","10790820"," They homeschool."
"10791040","10792400"," Then there's got religious homeschoolers."
"10792880","10794580"," And you got secular homeschoolers. "
"10796520","10800160"," And those are the ones that really piss off public school teachers, right?"
"10802520","10807960"," But you'll hear like a public school teacher will on one hand say homeschooling is not the best for"
"10807960","10808260"," a kid."
"10809640","10813680"," But then on the other hand, you'll see a teacher say, you know, kids are out of control in the"
"10813680","10816680"," schools and the high schools and the grade schools and all that kind of stuff."
"10816980","10819480"," And where I live, we only have so many choices. "
"10820260","10821080"," We've got like Cranbrook."
"10821300","10823200"," We've got a day school outside of that."
"10824060","10824700"," Schools there. "
"10825320","10826000"," They're okay."
"10826320","10827160"," It even in the great places."
"10827440","10827780"," They're okay. "
"10827780","10833700"," So you don't have too many choices for where I live, where you send your kids to school."
"10834560","10837520"," Do I pay taxes to get better schools?"
"10837740","10838040"," Fuck yeah."
"10838580","10840380"," Are they doing anything with that money to do it?"
"10840800","10840900"," Nope. "
"10842040","10843020"," They're doing the right thing."
"10843260","10844460"," No, they're dismantling schools."
"10844980","10845820"," A public school system. "
"10849460","10850140"," Where I live."
"10850380","10856240"," This was like the Michigan's one of the homes of the dismantling of schools."
"10856960","10857540"," What's her name?"
"10858080","10858760"," Forget her name. "
"10858960","10861800"," But the lady was selling like charter stuff."
"10863520","10863900"," Devos."
"10864360","10865060"," Is that her name?"
"10865180","10865760"," That's your Devos maybe?"
"10865960","10866700"," It could have been wrong, but. "
"10873970","10874350"," Yeah."
"10874470","10874790"," Cranbrook."
"10878050","10879190"," Definitely not a gang school. "
"10879710","10881210"," Like one of the best prep schools in the US."
"10883230","10883990"," Top school."
"10885450","10886130"," In the US. "
"10889030","10890970"," So yeah, you go to Cranbrook or do you go to."
"10891610","10892530"," Yeah, Dale."
"10894430","10896290"," You guys probably don't know what Cranbrook is, but. "
"10896850","10897530"," One of you guys."
"10897790","10898310"," What do you know?"
"10898470","10898990"," What do you know?"
"10899170","10901430"," Who's one of you know, uh, Cranbrook school?"
"10905770","10906490"," Oh really?"
"10906750","10907730"," Was it in eight mile?"
"10907930","10908450"," I didn't know that."
"10908790","10910930"," I didn't know he talked about Cranbrook in a mile. "
"10911370","10911970"," They had no idea."
"10912690","10913430"," That's new to me."
"10913930","10915310"," Yeah, they got mom spaghetti here. "
"10915450","10915830"," I don't know."
"10916390","10917930"," I didn't think I watched the movie, but."
"10918570","10921210"," They had like two decades since I watched that movie. "
"10923670","10924330"," No shit."
"10924630","10924730"," Yeah."
"10924930","10925130"," Cranbrook. "
"10926190","10927350"," That's the school to attend."
"10928710","10929490"," It's not cheap."
"10930050","10931310"," It's very expensive to go there. "
"10933550","10936310"," It's like twenty five thousand, I think right now."
"10937330","10937770"," Like that."
"10938090","10938570"," Twenty five a year. "
"10940150","10941290"," Twenty three and change."
"10944310","10945170"," And that's cheap."
"10945750","10946550"," Very expensive. "
"10952060","10954560"," Little bit reversal right now going on the SB 500."
"10954560","10956300"," A lot of drama going on right now."
"10960990","10962650"," Now is that kind of doing its thing. "
"10963870","10966550"," I'm watching a 30 minute chart on Nasdaq in the background."
"10968050","10969270"," Still says we're going up."
"10969970","10971130"," You get a lot of stress right now. "
"10971410","10973790"," I'm in a pretty big long position long call position."
"10974910","10975930"," See where it goes."
"10975930","10979890"," It's always down buying these dips where it's always sucks. "
"10980370","10982630"," We're always like, man, we're doing the right thing here or not."
"10987970","10989090"," This is a one minute."
"10989210","10991170"," So this one right here is a one minute chart on spy. "
"10992470","10996930"," And then down below, that's a Nasdaq chart set to a one minute."
"10998750","11000970"," And on a different screener that you can't see."
"11001110","11009190"," I'm sitting on a trigger screener for Nasdaq on a 30 minute so I can see that the velocity is"
"11009190","11010830"," doing what it's supposed to do. "
"11012370","11014790"," And then it's actually bullish here and not bearish."
"11015010","11018410"," I know that I know that you guys think it's bearish here, but I don't not see it as bearish."
"11025520","11026800"," See it as drama. "
"11028500","11029480"," Southside drama here."
"11031280","11034640"," And then I'm watching, of course, HYG and Vixi and Vix."
"11038760","11040600"," All I want is like a 300% trade. "
"11040800","11045760"," Just give me like one big 300% I think I got a few eighties."
"11045840","11046380"," I got a hundred."
"11047280","11057140"," Just want a nice 300% Yeah, we got a bunch of stuff. "
"11057260","11058100"," We're going to do it together, too."
"11058220","11059740"," So we got a lot of stuff to look at."
"11061560","11063360"," We got a lot of alerts kind of stuff. "
"11063600","11067960"," And then we've got like, I've got this whole other thing that we're doing with."
"11068320","11070960"," I don't know if I should say this, but."
"11070960","11072200"," No, I'm not going to say it public. "
"11072480","11073420"," We have two other."
"11073700","11074640"," It's not one either."
"11074760","11075120"," It's two. "
"11075160","11082200"," We got two other indicators built into the back end of the triggers that nobody has."
"11084440","11092960"," And we're still trying to calculate when it means something and when it doesn't."
"11092960","11098740"," When it's like, yeah, this will hold or this will we're going to blow through this and go lower or"
"11098740","11101240"," we're going to break through this thing to the upside. "
"11103680","11108480"," I'm not going to I was going to I was going to say in public, but I don't know if"
"11108480","11109500"," that's going to be a black box."
"11109680","11110640"," It might be a black box."
"11123180","11125900"," We have we have someone that knows math working on it right now. "
"11125900","11130760"," So we'll see if if with the math we the math still hasn't the math."
"11130900","11134000"," Well, one of the tools is proof or one of the additions is proven itself."
"11134680","11137560"," The other addition, I need more math. "
"11139360","11142040"," And we have we're not done calculating it yet."
"11142060","11143860"," So it's like a manual thing."
"11143880","11144520"," It kind of sucks. "
"11146780","11149680"," You need the probability to meet you like a problem."
"11149920","11152640"," You need like a question of probability."
"11152960","11158020"," Like if this happens under the circumstances, how many times does it go up or down. "
"11158740","11160120"," Kind of stuff."
"11161020","11166060"," And we get like an 80% probability of these circumstances that this happens."
"11167860","11168520"," There you go. "
"11168600","11169800"," There's a written math problem for you."
"11170520","11171760"," Basic, pretty basic, but."
"11176700","11177800"," Just sitting here waiting. "
"11178380","11181580"," I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a, fuck that a call."
"11181880","11184020"," So see what's up here."
"11187000","11188560"," Spy trying to squeeze right now. "
"11190700","11192820"," There's a real wall above up here."
"11193720","11196640"," They're trying to like, I don't know what the fuck the idea here is."
"11197760","11201420"," What you squeeze fucking NASDAQ all the way up and Spy doesn't follow. "
"11201700","11203080"," I don't know exactly what that is."
"11203840","11205560"," Great 30 cents right now."
"11210600","11211600"," Almost there. "
"11213780","11217140"," 100% of some of my trade and then upside down in part of it."
"11217260","11219700"," So as a combined total, starting to get green."
"11223960","11225600"," But I'm looking for a bigger trade. "
"11225600","11229000"," I'm actually looking for this R2 right here."
"11231660","11232900"," I should make that higher."
"11233540","11234960"," Or maybe I should add to it. "
"11253590","11257570"," And if they hold me into this like today, like bullshit in the end of the day, I'll be pissed."
"11258730","11265930"," If this is a trade for tomorrow, there's a moment here where there's a moment today where if I"
"11265930","11270870"," don't get this right now, they try to, they try to like do this kind of bullshit nonsense."
"11270870","11272310"," And the move is tomorrow. "
"11272310","11274510"," I might have to take some off the top right there."
"11275790","11279130"," And roll into tomorrow calls."
"11279630","11280430"," So we'll see where this goes. "
"11281590","11282890"," This doesn't happen."
"11283250","11288130"," If I can't get this to push itself up in a timely fashion."
"11290270","11294450"," If it wants to do like some kind of bullshit like this and then we go up into tomorrow. "
"11295430","11296830"," I might end up taking a roll."
"11297670","11299450"," I'll be green in here."
"11299450","11301110"," I'll be very green in here actually. "
"11303150","11307450"," So maybe I repositioned for some calls for tomorrow somewhere in here."
"11310390","11311490"," It's all about time."
"11314610","11316430"," Push that over so you can see it. "
"11322720","11323980"," I have today expiry."
"11324780","11326700"," I need to switch from today to tomorrow."
"11327980","11328980"," Not quite yet. "
"11329180","11330160"," I'm not quite there yet."
"11330300","11331380"," We're having to switch just yet."
"11333140","11339320"," But I will switch to if they pull that bullshit, I'll look towards the end of the day adding some"
"11339320","11341360"," one dates for tomorrow. "
"11342120","11343060"," We'll see how it goes."
"11343420","11343820"," We have some more time."
"11343960","11344420"," We have plenty of time. "
"11345080","11349700"," It's 12.47. We got another fucking, we got another 40 minutes here."
"11350460","11351900"," So we'll see what happens in the next 40 minutes."
"11353800","11355300"," I'm creating 32 right now. "
"11357260","11359780"," Remember that my original buy-in was 36."
"11360560","11361140"," So I'm ripping."
"11361380","11363680"," I'm making making some pretty good money right now. "
"11363820","11369000"," So I've added four or five times at this point."
"11369400","11370520"," I'm right down to 15 cents."
"11370800","11372160"," So let's see what's up. "
"11376780","11377820"," Come on now."
"11378180","11379000"," Bring it on up there."

"17589220","17595180"," have something that's telling you something in the future now even if it doesn't hold up uh you"
"17595180","17600120"," need to be you need to see something right what am i seeing is seeing all this stuff this momentum"
"17600120","17605600"," coming up to meet up with spy to squeeze above the daily trigger we already know where the"
"17605600","17611640"," resistance is right we knew it before even get there right you see the bounce right here they're"
"17611640","17616400"," trying to sell it down underneath this hourly trigger now right so like we know where this is we"
"17616400","17622460"," know where this is we know where that is we know where support is it's right here right this is"
"17622460","17629740"," support does it make sense to you so where are you buying dips down on support does that make sense"
"17629740","17639430"," so if we begin to roll the market if we start to trade under the"
"17639430","17646010"," market am i trying to buy a dip right here fuck no i'm not does that make sense no i'm"
"17646010","17651430"," not trying to buy a dip right there does that make sense anything down here i am trying to buy"
"17651430","17657050"," a dip right trying to buy a dip right trying to buy a dip down here for the upside move"
"17657050","17665430"," does that make sense to you has to it's getting has to uh because that is what you do you"
"17665430","17673790"," do it all the time Now, if you break below this hourly trigger, this is intraday trend, intraday"
"17673790","17674650"," trend right here."
"17676090","17683090"," If you start to get closing bars underneath, right, you're selling the market from that point, does"
"17683090","17683650"," that make sense?"
"17684790","17688730"," So this is where you're selling the market, this is where you're buying the market, this is where"
"17688730","17690390"," resistance is above, right?"
"17691450","17693070"," Now why didn't I take it here?"
"17693850","17698590"," Because Nasdaq's saying we're going higher, they have also motioned down here, right?"
"17699450","17703430"," Now I'm still long here to go to the upside, now I don't know how you trade or what you"
"17703430","17709550"," trade or what you're trying to trade out there, but most of the time this works like 80% of"
"17709550","17715170"," the time, 80, 80% of the time. "
"17715430","17721170"," So if there's one or two L's in there, I'm still going to buy this fucking dip down here and"
"17721170","17725270"," this support down here, does that make sense?"
"17725690","17734350"," And now on a 30 minute chart down here on spoos, the daily is getting bullish, I want you to"
"17734350","17734810"," see this."
"17736830","17740930"," The daily is getting bullish, this is not intraday but daily."
"17742190","17746010"," Get a little bit of a roll over here, come back down to the zero line and just looking for"
"17746010","17748670"," that rest of that push to the upside here. "
"17749710","17753130"," So I'm still long here, still waiting here for this move higher."
"17753770","17755570"," Now here's the fascinating part of all this."
"17756650","17764690"," The fascinating part is if we close the day up here, right, if we close the day on the end"
"17764690","17771030"," of the day up here, people will disappear, they're gone, people in chat will disappear. "
"17772450","17780150"," If we close tomorrow, if it takes until tomorrow for that to happen, right, people disappear,"
"17780410","17784190"," they're like, I didn't know or he lost one trade, but then he lost, then he won his fourth trade."
"17784490","17789250"," He won three out of four, right, then he won five out of six, then he won eight out of"
"17789250","17790650"," nine, then he won nine out of ten."
"17791650","17796130"," And so you start to look at that whole picture and this is where you buy the dip. "
"17796910","17802730"," This is where you buy the dip, they're there, there, there for that push higher, unless we begin to"
"17802730","17809930"," roll over, right, you start to sell down over here, you're not a dip buyer, you're a seller at that"
"17809930","17815050"," point, you're a seller right here, does that make sense?"
"17816330","17819150"," So when you're talking to the chat saying like, oh, why are you buying this?"
"17819390","17824030"," What's the reasoning, that kind of stuff, it's because this is where you put risk out of the"
"17824030","17824310"," market."
"17825030","17828630"," No, I don't know that you want to put risk out of the market down here, but I do."
"17829830","17837760"," You put risk on wherever you want to put risk and I can assure you that, I can assure you"
"17837760","17844200"," that there's a ton of people that called this bullish and that bearish and that bullish and that"
"17844200","17848580"," bearish and that bullish and that bearish and that bullish and that bearish, you know, and that"
"17848580","17852140"," bearish, you know, and right now I'm like, nah, we'll try that one again. "
"17853780","17856020"," That's worked enough for me, right?"
"17856020","17858080"," It's worked out, take the money and run, right?"
"17858280","17863120"," Take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money and run,"
"17863180","17864700"," take the money and run, right?"
"17865700","17873120"," Ah, there you go, sorry buddy, we're going up, you know, where's the next natural progression right"
"17873120","17873400"," there?"
"17875340","17884260"," So I'm sorry, I apologize, makes me not want to stream, I'll be honest with you, makes me not want"
"17884260","17893040"," to stream, it's still long right now,"
"17895450","17906340"," yeah, there's"
"17906340","17916300"," no role in Nasdaq either, Nasdaq's still sitting outside early, the only thing that's pissing"
"17916300","17921600"," me off, there's one thing that's like really pissed me off today, it's this right here."
"17924160","17929760"," It's the only thing that's got the fly in my, the fly in my ass today, is this shit right"
"17929760","17935560"," here, then up to 378,000 contracts."
"17936320","17940560"," So they're just loading up, loading up, loading up, all the money. "
"17942460","17951640"," Now what would I like these to be, I'd like them to be like, yeah, 440 or 450s would be"
"17951640","17960640"," nice if they're 450s would be great, they can print those, no problem, print like 10 cents or"
"17960640","17961000"," something."
"17964980","17976140"," For example, as close as I'm 21 a barrel, that's down 60 cents or zero spot, 69% on the"
"17976140","17979540"," other side, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60"
"17979540","17999350"," cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60"
"17999350","18000970"," cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 60 cents,"

"18018670","18022310"," 60 cents, 60 cents, 60 cents, where I've been on the wrong side of trading for too long."
"18022570","18032590"," So these past like five years or so, it's been fucking longer than five, yeah, five"
"18032590","18033150"," or six years. "
"18034150","18037390"," I've been more and more right sides of the trades than wrong sides of the trades."
"18037390","18045530"," So I'll take my chances down here, I'll take my chances, the only thing that's bugging the fuck out"
"18045530","18046730"," of me is this shit down here."
"18047350","18051190"," This shit right here makes me think that they fucking pin this shit in the clothes today. "
"18054410","18055970"," This is bullshit right here."
"18060730","18063090"," On and off, well, you know, it's fucked up."
"18063390","18069890"," So you want to know, you want to really start trading right before Occupy Wall Street was invented. "
"18070590","18080430"," As a matter of fact, I fucking found pictures of me this weekend building a hexier for the Occupy"
"18080430","18084170"," Wall Street burning them on pictures this weekend."
"18084170","18085690"," I was like, shit me not."
"18086810","18094310"," And prior to that, for the last three years before that, we were trading Bitcoin for a year before"
"18094310","18095930"," that, somewhere in there. "
"18096730","18102670"," We were trading Silk Road, we were doing things on Silk Road, so that's where it all began."
"18103250","18106430"," I love you, too, porch."
"18108950","18110030"," Yeah, way back then. "
"18110250","18116710"," Well, it's not way back, but outside of that, before that, it was just like parents gave me stocks"
"18116710","18126210"," and stuff sold those, but I got my start, believe it or not, in Bitcoin when it was worthless, for"
"18126210","18128590"," nefarious purposes, nothing too illegal."
"18130510","18131590"," Nothing too illegal."
"18132470","18138890"," It's hanging out with the tech pros out in Silicon Valley at the burn, like I couldn't believe I"
"18138890","18141970"," found, you know, I was building hexier, it's way back in the day. "
"18143370","18147330"," It was like it was the first or second year that they had done hexier, it's at the burn."
"18147570","18151290"," First time they'd come to the, I think they were already doing them for, at that point they were"
"18151290","18157690"," doing them for Hurricane and the earthquake, we were really testing them, but I think the year"
"18157690","18159550"," before was the first time I saw a hexier."
"18163790","18170110"," Oh, fuck no, dude, I got nightmare Bitcoin stories, nightmares, dude, it's like, you asked me crazy"
"18170110","18177990"," shit, like I got horrible, horrible Bitcoin stories, so my, so"
"18177990","18186950"," I moved to a ski town, and my landlord was my friend,"
"18187550","18194150"," and he owned a duplex, and he was like, you want to rent out the other side, so I rented"
"18194150","18203950"," out the other side of the duplex, and he was an engineer, and he was an engineer at a TV"
"18203950","18211750"," station, and this is fucking year, this is when like Reddit was like a year and a half old, maybe,"
"18212070","18217330"," you know, I think Reddit was maybe a year and a half old, maybe it could have been younger than"
"18217330","18223110"," that, I don't know, like six to nine months or a year and a half, Reddit was a, was the"
"18223110","18232490"," original Reddit, so I was like an original user of Reddit too, and, and my neighbor was mining the"
"18232490","18238750"," US oil output from Top shale producing regions in September, a beautiful to the lowest since May"
"18238750","18239790"," 2023. "
"18240770","18247430"," On these servers at a TV station, and he's like, they'll never know, he's like, they'll never know,"
"18247430","18256920"," he's like, he's like, no one knows about the stuff, he's like, no one will ever know about that,"
"18256920","18262000"," that I'm doing this now, of course, today, he would stand out like a sore thumb, like he would"
"18262000","18267320"," tell, you could tell, and of course, this, this TV station was like talking about the power bills"
"18267320","18274300"," in a place like that, like how much money it costs to mine all that Bitcoin back that it must"
"18274300","18279100"," have been, it's because it's stupid today to do the same thing, but it was all free, like all free"
"18279100","18284960"," that was illegal what he was doing, but no one cared, no one knew, right, what he was doing."
"18286160","18289560"," Yeah, I think so, I was originally on far."
"18291340","18297700"," And US part of me and oil out parts and then part with the lowest since February 2023 being"
"18297700","18302280"," popular, maybe I get those wrong, I can't remember which one came first, but I think it was like"
"18302280","18307000"," far than dig or dig was there maybe and then got dig got big and then they both like monetized"
"18307000","18307980"," everything and they got stupid. "
"18308680","18314560"," People were writing bots and stuff for those, for those, there was like a bunch of pool, like they"
"18314560","18319140"," would, I think they would know that so wasn't bought, you know it was they were advertising and"
"18319140","18323480"," pushing content for ad dollars."
"18323800","18325420"," I think that's how that ended."
"18325820","18333070"," I'm trying to think back a long time ago. "
"18334270","18338650"," So they would have, so they would have, sorry, I'm doing some work in the background."
"18341820","18347540"," So, so anyways, he, so he was mining Bitcoin and he was like, you should start mining Bitcoin."
"18349120","18356100"," And I did, like I would mine Bitcoin and I already owned some Bitcoin because I was doing, I was"
"18356100","18360000"," trying to like buy, you know, like molly and mushrooms and that kind of stuff. "
"18360640","18364380"," And you couldn't get it legally."
"18365800","18368820"," And you wanted to buy it safely."
"18370120","18371220"," So you knew what you're getting. "
"18372260","18376680"," You didn't want to buy it from like some nefarious character or buy it."
"18376800","18380280"," At that time, you couldn't go to a city and get real stuff."
"18380740","18385440"," You couldn't outside of cities, you could, but if you were like trying to buy it from someone in"
"18385440","18390900"," New York or something or L.A. it was all dog shit, even then it was all gross nastiness. "
"18391580","18398300"," So people turned to, people turned to Silk Road to get good connections."
"18398400","18401660"," A lot of it was coming in from Europe and Israel and places like that."
"18402740","18405080"," And so you could get, and then you test it. "
"18405260","18408700"," There was a big testing company back there because it's called Dance Safe or something."
"18408900","18411540"," It was called, so anyways, that was like a big thing."
"18411900","18418920"," All the tech pros from Silicon Valley would show up out into U.S. Eagle for the oil output in"
"18418920","18425840"," September, 2020, you couldn't buy that stuff without cryptocurrency. "
"18426020","18427300"," You need a cryptocurrency to buy it."
"18427540","18430000"," So I accumulated, accumulated, accumulated, it was worthless."
"18430500","18434520"," I remember it was like 0.000, 000, 000, 000, 000, like 23. "
"18440590","18447330"," So you're like, so Bitcoin would be like, so I would accumulate it."
"18447870","18455570"," And at that time, I would never hold more than like 1,500, maybe $3,000 of that kind of"
"18455570","18460110"," oil output in September due to rise to the highest since November 2020."
"18463100","18465200"," Watching a cluster of the downside form here. "
"18466960","18468380"," Oh, you guys can't see this."
"18468560","18472080"," So I'm watching a cluster of the downside of a one and five minute coming into the hourly trigger"
"18472080","18472420"," area."
"18473280","18475920"," It's looking pretty bearish here on Nasdaq. "
"18476340","18480720"," I'm going to cut these calls loose at some point really getting pretty close for me to pick up"
"18480720","18481120"," inputs."
"18483040","18484380"," Pretty close right now."
"18507020","18509300"," I've got a 445 set up one more time. "
"18510040","18510840"," I haven't bought them yet."
"18512020","18516000"," So, so I would like own maybe like 1,000, 3,000."
"18516160","18518540"," I wasn't a drug user or dealer either. "
"18518540","18520120"," So I just want to be clear here."
"18521020","18528940"," Most of my adult life, most of my adult life, almost like childhood teenage years of adult life, no"
"18528940","18530860"," drug use ever."
"18532060","18532460"," None. "
"18533220","18535500"," I was not only part of my scene or anything like that."
"18535880","18538340"," And never a regular drug user never smoked the marijuana."
"18538620","18540380"," I was in the military for a long time. "
"18540420","18541840"," I was in and out of the military I should say."
"18544220","18547500"," So I was never had like a history of drug use anything like that."
"18547960","18552800"," But there were times where I was like, yeah, I want to go to like Burning Man and I want"
"18552800","18556540"," to do this or I want to have a spiritual moment with mushrooms that kind of stuff. "
"18557700","18562180"," And I didn't want to like, I don't know drug well, I guess I shouldn't say don't know drug users."
"18562480","18563200"," It's really bizarre."
"18563840","18564740"," It's a side note here. "
"18565640","18568740"," So when you live in very wealthy places, you're not going to believe this."
"18568940","18572800"," But there's like more drug use in wealthy places."
"18573220","18574040"," Well, I shouldn't say more. "
"18575060","18579740"," If you live in somewhere wealthy, there's a shit ton of drugs, good drugs, and they're everywhere."
"18581160","18583440"," Wherever they party, hang out, it's always there."
"18583600","18583860"," They're not. "
"18584920","18586380"," Sometimes people are public about it."
"18586480","18590300"," But oftentimes you just have to know the right person and be in the right place the right time."
"18591500","18597460"," Some of the grossest things I ever saw in my adult life was that wealthy people tended to use a"
"18597460","18599380"," lot of good drugs and tons of them. "
"18599760","18602740"," They never sold, I guess they did sell them, but a lot of people was free."
"18603040","18603660"," They'd just sit there."
"18603800","18604700"," You could just get whatever you want. "
"18605300","18606380"," And that sounds crazy to you."
"18606400","18607640"," You might be like, no, that doesn't happen."
"18607640","18610840"," In your suburban life, maybe it doesn't. "
"18611320","18615760"," But in real wealthy circles, there's tons of drug use."
"18616080","18616300"," It's everywhere."
"18618680","18620460"," And it's all designer kind of stuff. "
"18621100","18626280"," So anyways, that's how I was like, yeah, I want to go on a spiritual journey."
"18626720","18628280"," And I want to go to Burning Man and what's happened."
"18629560","18632480"," So of course, getting involved in Bitcoin, right?"
"18632740","18633940"," I want to do it safely. "
"18634340","18636120"," And I want to get in trouble and also stuff."
"18637740","18640900"," And I would like have money left over in Bitcoin."
"18642520","18650140"," And I just, just after that, as a matter of fact, I started having kids and some having kids and"
"18650140","18651260"," of course not doing drugs. "
"18652000","18653760"," Got kids can't do drugs and have kids."
"18654700","18656540"," Can't like, can't go crazy."
"18657220","18658560"," Can't go off deep under that stuff. "
"18658740","18663620"," So you're like, so I would leave the money in the Bitcoin, right?"
"18664560","18671660"," And my now wife would be like, my now wife would be like, we need that money."
"18672020","18674460"," And I'd be like, no, no, I'm just going to leave it in there for like next decade."
"18674660","18675840"," So we need that money. "
"18676700","18678540"," And so I would sell it."
"18679600","18682200"," I would like read a story about a halving coming up or something."
"18682380","18684920"," I'd be like, ooh, if I don't get out, that's going down. "
"18686000","18690880"," And so I would actually sell my holdings in Bitcoin."
"18691180","18693660"," And I was like, I'm never going to buy, well, Silk Road blew up."
"18693860","18696520"," And I thought it was like blue dream. "
"18696680","18703480"," It was a couple other different of those nefarious sites came up came and went."
"18704240","18706000"," And of course, my life was changing."
"18706280","18707340"," My lifestyle was changing. "
"18708860","18710280"," And I'm like, yeah, I'll just get rid of it."
"18710340","18714140"," And then of course, my buddy had kept mining mining it, mining it."
"18714840","18715920"," And he thought I was crazy. "
"18716160","18716920"," He's like, what are you doing?"
"18717200","18718060"," He's like, just suffer."
"18719020","18720340"," And I didn't suffer."
"18720740","18721740"," I spent that money. "
"18722520","18723820"," Never should have spent it."
"18724260","18725780"," Never should have listened to my wife."
"18732360","18739450"," Yeah, that's true. "
"18739730","18741130"," I agree with that bear town sheriff."
"18741510","18742590"," I totally agree with that."
"18743350","18748490"," Like there was a time when you could get away with that stuff, but nobody knew not anymore, like I"
"18748490","18750790"," agree with you with the computing power and the chips. "
"18750850","18753470"," And there's more money in doing that than there is in doing science."
"18754030","18755130"," Like, it's all bad."
"18756330","18759710"," So I think I sold two large holdings in Bitcoin. "
"18760430","18762030"," Now, my buddy kept doing it."
"18762410","18763570"," And he did it for years."
"18764690","18768250"," And he kept working at that TV station. "
"18768870","18770370"," And he kept doing it for years."
"18770750","18775090"," And he is, he's got fucking money now."
"18775690","18777510"," He's got straight fucking money still known. "
"18778610","18782050"," He'll never work ever for the rest of his life ever again."
"18783070","18785970"," He's one of those original like, he's an original guy, man."
"18786050","18790830"," He's like, from the beginning, had that foresight. "
"18791210","18791750"," I've done that."
"18791850","18797890"," I think, I think I've had three or four instances where I've majorly fucked up."
"18798150","18799470"," Like that was one of them. "
"18800310","18806530"," The second major fuck up that I had was, I was buying properties and selling them."
"18806910","18816690"," So I'd buy like a property for like 1,500 bucks, three grand in need of rehab, $3,500."
"18817470","18819030"," I see you're not 1,500 bucks. "
"18821050","18829450"," And had I held those through until COVID, they would sell for 35 to 50 right now with nothing done"
"18829450","18831110"," on them, like no work done."
"18833670","18841910"," If I just added and held and added and held and added and held another big mistake."
"18843070","18850230"," So like, get in perfect timing and then quick fast money, quick flips like buy them and sell them. "
"18850750","18851610"," It's basically what I was doing."
"18851850","18858470"," So buy a property for cheap like, you know, 1,500 bucks, put it up to sale for like 7 "
"18858470","18859570",",500, 10 grand."
"18862810","18864890"," Okay, the taxes take four or five grand. "
"18867190","18869330"," And, but I was, and then it's weird."
"18869450","18875250"," My friends were all holding and they'd all switched, they'd all switched over to buy and hold and"
"18875250","18877290"," then rehab and rent never did that."
"18879290","18880790"," So I don't own that many properties. "
"18881010","18886370"," I could have, I could have, like right now I could probably have owned like 30 to 50."
"18886570","18894050"," And what's even more insane is, it's even more insane is that there was a people do it, dude."
"18895790","18902770"," It's even more insane is that, uh, it's even more insane is that I had other properties that were"
"18902770","18906450"," offered to me at that time that needed barely anything. "
"18907590","18911110"," 20 grand, 25 grand, stupid shit like that."
"18911770","18915590"," And those houses right now where I live, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll get, we'll get, we'll get today"
"18915590","18924230"," to get 160 to 200 un renovated, like untouched, uh, renovated 300, 350."
"18925070","18926370"," So I fucked that up too. "
"18929850","18931130"," No patience."
"18932210","18935570"," So now what I do is I buy these things that I never sell."
"18935850","18941670"," Like it's passed like five to seven years. "
"18942530","18946270"," Anything that I buy now, I'm like, nope, never selling it."
"18947630","18948690"," Never selling it."
"18952330","18954250"," Like never again, like now I buy crypto. "
"18954790","18959210"," And if it burns to the depths of hell, I just buy it, throw it, throw it in the throat"
"18959210","18962710"," of the bank, throw it in Coinbase, throw it in Coinbase."
"18968460","18969240"," I'm like, you know what?"
"18969360","18972620"," I'm not what's bizarre is some of these have come up pretty decent."
"18973300","18976300"," Uh, some of them become winners and I still leave them there. "
"18976380","18976960"," I don't take the money."
"18977040","18977760"," I'm just like, fuck it."
"18978020","18980940"," It's going to leave them there and check back in 10 or 15 or 20 years. "
"18981960","18984360"," All I need is like one or two of them to hit and I'll be good."
"18997360","18998040"," Damn."
"18998180","19000340"," U S steel, man, moving. "
"19003500","19004820"," Hell yeah."
"19005340","19006300"," U S steel moving."
"19007480","19009140"," U S steel cranking. "
"19010040","19011900"," They didn't get the half back trade."
"19012560","19013400"," Started moving."
"19014420","19018640"," It's like U S steel like leaps are going to print stupid. "
"19024740","19034040"," Yeah, on, on like, on, on like"
"19034040","19036840"," long term holding stuff."
"19037720","19044340"," Like, like I'm thinking about a point in life, like I'm thinking about a point in life where I"
"19044340","19050300"," never, I didn't know if I'd get to that point, but I think I'm getting to a point where I"
"19050300","19054580"," want to, I want to buy and hold I think I want to hold spy for like 10 or 15"
"19054580","19054900"," years."
"19056160","19060580"," If I can, I'd like to, I'd like to own it for like 15 years. "
"19061140","19067140"," So if I can get that opportunity in the springtime, like late winter, I think that's what I'm going"
"19067140","19067400"," to do."
"19069140","19077160"," Just start building the long term portfolio 10, 15 years and I really don't care if it keeps 3400"
"19077160","19078680"," or 36 or 38."
"19079500","19081380"," I don't know that I would care too much. "
"19082100","19083840"," I think even went down even more."
"19083940","19091460"," I don't, I'd probably just add more leave like 10 or 15% in a money market or something so"
"19091460","19092780"," that I can add to that pile."
"19093100","19094540"," But I'm getting close to that point. "
"19105490","19107410"," Yeah, it's not attached right now."
"19116160","19119860"," But I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the, you know, it's another weird thing."
"19119960","19125500"," I get like weird things like they're like been changing the past few years. "
"19125500","19127580"," Like I was going to get rid of a Cadillac Escalade."
"19129980","19132560"," I sold a one test like a one test left."
"19134020","19137400"," I don't want to like, like my Escalade have been taking care of it. "
"19137980","19138900"," Treating it really well."
"19139520","19145700"," And like I'm in this age where I'm like, I'm like, yeah, I can probably drive that for another five"
"19145700","19146000"," years."
"19146760","19148360"," You could probably get my worth out of it. "
"19148700","19152420"," I'm like, I could probably take care of it and it will look, my Escalade looks banging."
"19153180","19156180"," It's the last iteration of it."
"19156480","19161900"," So not the newest one, but I'm like, man, I can, I can, like, if it's going to be depreciating,"
"19162180","19166960"," if I can keep it looking great, take good care of it. "
"19166960","19171300"," Uh, I can get my, my huge money's worth."
"19171560","19173500"," And now I'm like, loaning myself money."
"19175060","19180220"," Like I'm saving money that I'm actually making interest. "
"19180600","19188040"," We'd, matter of fact, we'd just open a Weebull account just to get the interest off it."
"19188620","19192660"," And so we have a Weebull account now that we don't trade on it or nothing."
"19192660","19195760"," And it's just, it's like paying myself a car loan. "
"19195760","19199300"," And I'm actually getting paid in my car loan right now."
"19200840","19205400"," So, you know, it's, um, a different, different kind of life."
"19205600","19206640"," I think getting to this weird age. "
"19215110","19216270"," It's definitely Elon."
"19216610","19218430"," I'm 100% sure it's Elon trying to buy it."
"19219470","19220530"," I'm like, not 100. "
"19220790","19223730"," I'm like, 80 to 90% sure that's Elon buying US Steel."
"19225370","19226770"," Almost, almost sure of it."
"19228390","19236070"," I talked about it this morning at 9.30 like just put on some, just put on some fucking Jan"
"19236070","19242670"," 25 calls on, uh, on X and it's going to rip stupid. "
"19242950","19244450"," It's going to go bonkers."
"19246230","19250510"," There's the other argument that'll be the most shorted stock out there because of, uh, Twitter."
"19251990","19258130"," But if they were to roll SpaceX into it, if they were to roll US Steel into it, and then"
"19258130","19261710"," if they were to add anything else into any kind of energy companies, any kind of like electricity"
"19261710","19267730"," companies, mining companies, any of that kind of stuff, uh, Neuralink gets rolled into it, but"
"19267730","19270470"," they're going to shoot X to the moon. "
"19272330","19274230"," They'll, they will shoot X to the moon."
"19274630","19276610"," X will just go like never stop."
"19276810","19277570"," It'll never come back. "
"19278310","19281770"," Well, it'll come back, but they're going to jump on it like boom."
"19286190","19289110"," Yeah, I'm still, I'm actually waiting here to see what they're doing to this close."
"19289110","19294310"," So if I have to, I'll buy some calls for tomorrow. "
"19304180","19306000"," You guys didn't know, right."
"19306200","19308460"," So, uh, we, we led the show with this this morning."
"19308460","19317980"," So, uh, Elon Musk is likely putting a bid in to buy US Steel Corporation. "
"19318680","19319580"," I think that's the full name."
"19319580","19323720"," Um, which is US Steel, right?"
"19324000","19326320"," Uh, they've been around since the beginning of time."
"19326680","19329020"," That's why they have, uh, that's why they're called X."
"19330920","19342070"," Uh, so the lesser the letters symbols in your name, the more likely that it's an older, an"
"19342070","19343250"," older company, right?"
"19344270","19353590"," Um, and he likes X and, uh, not only does he like X, but figure a guy his age, he's"
"19353590","19354410"," not getting any younger. "
"19355450","19357610"," Uh, he's got more money than, than most people."
"19358390","19361250"," Uh, and I realized that Twitter is a failure."
"19361630","19361850"," It is. "
"19362550","19365770"," Uh, you can't, no matter how you cut it, slice it or dice it, it's a fucking failure."
"19366650","19368670"," Um, you can do whatever you want with it."
"19368770","19372570"," I don't care but you fucked up way overpaid for the property. "
"19373370","19376230"," So, uh, but that doesn't matter to him, right?"
"19376230","19378210"," Guys got more money than anybody, right?"
"19378370","19381110"," I can do it, not anybody but bounces around."
"19381510","19386010"," But, uh, the idea here would be that if he's able to consolidate all this stuff, uh, I'm sure that"
"19386010","19391390"," he's got people out there saying to him, yeah, Elon, we know you're going to Mars, but yeah, well,"
"19391470","19396510"," this wealth, why not start to make a conglomerate of, um, companies?"
"19398230","19400490"," Uh, makes sense, makes sense to me."
"19400750","19410490"," So, um, you figure, if he starts to buy all these companies up, buys X, puts it all under an"
"19410490","19416470"," umbrella, and if it's not just Twitter under that umbrella, I guess that's the key point, right?"
"19417010","19422950"," Because you kind of want all a bunch of companies under this umbrella, uh, and becomes like"
"19423930","19424370"," Megalomart. "
"19425630","19426830"," That's the intent, right?"
"19426990","19429910"," We've talked about that on the show, uh, about the intent."
"19430790","19436450"," On this show, we talk about how there's a civil war going on, behind the scenes of social media,"
"19436950","19445070"," and that it's from some oligarchs, and they want the phythms, kingdoms, uh, for your attention."
"19445210","19451070"," They want you to pay your bills, your insurance, your stock trading, uh, your dishwasher rental"
"19451070","19452130"," from your rental home. "
"19452650","19459270"," They want you to pay for your rental home through X, or through Google, or through, uh, whatever"
"19459270","19461090"," site that you can think of that's out there."
"19461170","19464490"," Even Reddit, Amazon, uh, wants this too."
"19464710","19466290"," Apple wants this too. "
"19467050","19475630"," So, there's this big race behind the scenes, uh, to, for, to like, either break up, the world, uh,"
"19477030","19478950"," into these kingdoms and phythms, right?"
"19479350","19482150"," They don't want you to vote, and they want you to vote on these social media sites."
"19482690","19486710"," They want you to get angry, they want you to get happy, want you to pick your winner, and then"
"19486710","19488190"," they want you to spend your money to them."
"19488490","19491070"," They want, think of it like on a matrix, right?"
"19491230","19494070"," You like hook somebody up to with a hose. "
"19495150","19497590"," It puts you in the tube, right?"
"19497850","19502150"," The little tube, they start hooking you up with hoses, and they suck you for all your work."
"19503410","19509410"," And you're none the wiser, or you're happy wherever that place is, that little corner, that little"
"19509410","19511530"," safe room, that little safe space that you've been given."
"19512270","19516870"," I don't care what your thoughts are, but they're gonna, like, I don't care what your politics are"
"19516870","19517330"," and all that. "
"19517450","19519790"," You'll find, you'll, they'll give you your own little room that you're happy in."
"19521210","19525310"," So you have your space, and you're happy, and you're not voting, and you're voting on the internet."
"19527350","19529830"," And so, like, X is an idea behind that, right?"
"19529990","19536010"," So, if, if you've got one of these megacorps, or Megalomarks, uh, companies, whether it's Apple or"
"19536010","19540090"," Google, it doesn't matter who it is, you got an Elon Musk want to do the same thing. "
"19540690","19545750"," And, um, to fund his exploration of Mars or whatever ego, I don't care what it is."
"19547450","19556350"," But if that entails U.S. Steel, if that, if that ever shown it, if that ever became something in"
"19556350","19563030"," 20, 30 years, you want to be the person that's like, yeah, I bought X when it was, uh, $20"
"19563030","19564650"," or $31, right?"
"19564850","19565130"," $29."
"19567250","19568330"," I've held it ever since. "
"19569010","19570470"," It's now worth $1,500."
"19570650","19571870"," It's split 16 times."
"19573050","19574330"," That was original by it. "
"19574450","19578930"," So I'm assuming that's the, uh, we're gonna assume that that's the speculation over X."
"19583810","19585330"," Yeah, yeah, they should offer it."
"19585450","19586270"," So there should be more."
"19586550","19591770"," So I want you to know that yesterday, there was multiple, or it was reported that where there were"
"19591770","19595790"," multiple orders or offers for U.S. Steel. "
"19595970","19597930"," So you know, clarify something here."
"19598350","19599930"," When you see an offer come in, right?"
"19600370","19602250"," It's not going to be just one company."
"19602990","19605210"," So you're going to see multiple names thrown around. "
"19605270","19612710"," It's going to be like, um, you'll see like, it won't just be like, uh, Elon Musk offers to buy"
"19612710","19613770"," and that's it."
"19613810","19616670"," You're going to see other companies put bids into buy that."
"19616670","19620530"," I don't know. "
"19620670","19621750"," I think we're, I think we're pinned."
"19622610","19623930"," I'm long calls right now."
"19624130","19626370"," If we don't trade up here, I'm going to have to roll into tomorrow. "
"19626610","19629850"," So I'm the five cents right now."
"19629930","19631230"," I'm getting, I'm getting forged here."
"19632250","19635390"," I'm in for about, I'm in total for about 19 cents. "
"19635590","19636710"," I'm pretty upside down right now."
"19636710","19638470"," I'm down 60, 70%."
"19638470","19640570"," Uh, maybe, maybe even more. "
"19641470","19641770"," So we'll see."
"19644800","19647120"," I was then adding 100 packs after the end."
"19647120","19649320"," So I'm feeling pretty good here. "
"19649940","19653100"," Uh, if they do burn, let's, what time is it right now?"
"19653640","19654460"," It's two PM."
"19654720","19656280"," Let's do a quick market overview here."
"19658420","19661740"," So if they do burn here, uh, let's talk about tomorrow. "
"19662040","19663020"," It's two o'clock in the afternoon."
"19663560","19667240"," We're going to do a market update here before we even get into the end of the day."
"19671960","19674900"," We're going to take a look here and see what we're getting some resistance above. "
"19675380","19675380"," Why?"
"19676040","19677700"," Are we getting resistance to the upside?"
"19677760","19678660"," We know why, right?"
"19678880","19680900"," We know why we're getting resistance to the upside."
"19681440","19688860"," Uh, these sellers do not want to see, uh, bulls regain, uh, this 447, this daily trigger more"
"19688860","19689300"," specifically."
"19690240","19691920"," Uh, they don't want to see it. "
"19692100","19694260"," So the, the, the bears have come a long way."
"19694840","19698580"," Last, uh, Thursday and Friday, they finally got underneath the daily trigger."
"19699240","19701640"," Now let me show it to you in a better light here. "
"19702220","19707840"," Let me switch over to, uh, the main screen here."
"19708600","19709540"," No, trigger screen."
"19710400","19720220"," So let's say it's spoos really quick on this screener and sellers have, have gained some ground"
"19720220","19720600"," here. "
"19720720","19722220"," You might not be able to see it here."
"19723320","19724960"," The sellers have gained ground here."
"19725800","19727120"," You have a target to the downside. "
"19729080","19731360"," I talked about this one here."
"19731660","19732880"," How do I get that to do with it?"
"19733080","19733720"," Good thing for me."
"19734900","19735460"," Yeah. "
"19735560","19745340"," The target down here for sellers or, or the intent of sellers here is to keep price below 447 "
"19745340","19750660",".59. And this is the most successful they've been."
"19750940","19756660"," And there's another key point here, which is looking even farther out in time into the end of the"
"19756660","19757020"," quarter."
"19758260","19766160"," If they can start to make us come down here into this 432, even if we get a retracement trade,"
"19767000","19767440"," right?"
"19767640","19771820"," There's a magnet below or even underneath here. "
"19772020","19775080"," There's a magnet into end of quarter down at 420."
"19775820","19782600"," Uh, on the, on the JPM call, it'll be, it'll turn into a magnet down there into"
"19782600","19790680"," end of to aggressively try to sell this market down."
"19790820","19795000"," Like you're going to see my queries come out there and be like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. "
"19795020","19797080"," We got our first part of the correction here, right?"
"19797740","19798620"," And we did a video."
"19798840","19801540"," We said, don't be, don't be, don't be crazy."
"19801640","19803220"," If you see this happen, when, what did it do?"
"19803340","19803900"," It happened, right?"
"19805640","19807880"," And now we're in, we're in phase two, right?"
"19808160","19810580"," Phase two becomes, eh, you know what?"
"19811460","19816500"," Let's keep it underneath the jelly trigger and begin to drop down and make our next leg down to,"
"19816840","19818360"," uh, that 432. "
"19819020","19822680"," So this is kind of an important place for sellers to hold."
"19822940","19824520"," What does the seller not want to see?"
"19824700","19825480"," We already know, right?"
"19826240","19831440"," You don't want to see, sellers don't want to see price getting above this 470, 447."
"19832020","19834000"," They don't want to see the hourly trigger come up here. "
"19834000","19839620"," They don't want to see any of this stuff starting to clear out all this stuff above, particularly"
"19839620","19840580"," not this week."
"19840620","19841660"," They don't want to see it, right?"
"19841860","19842880"," They don't want to see that this week."
"19843840","19847100"," Even if there's continuation down, they don't want to see it, right?"
"19847440","19848780"," They don't want to see that retracement. "
"19849240","19850840"," They want to see continuation of the downside."
"19851120","19852180"," So what's Barry going to tell you?"
"19852400","19854200"," They're going to be like, fuck you, I sold this market."
"19854680","19855760"," We're going down to 432. "
"19856240","19857160"," It's going to go right out on Twitter."
"19858040","19862240"," You're going to get people with money on this market to the downside saying the same thing."
"19862680","19863060"," Why?"
"19863440","19865060"," Because we're in a critical place here. "
"19865600","19868740"," We're in a critical place here to sell this market right here."
"19868840","19869220"," You see it?"
"19870140","19873480"," Don't want to see it go up, right?"
"19873740","19876860"," So now NQ, telling a little bit of a different story."
"19878380","19880720"," Then Q is telling you that we can go up a little bit more. "
"19888080","19892600"," And Q is saying, yeah, we can squeeze up just a little bit more up here before we even begin"
"19892600","19893520"," to think about a roll."
"19894120","19899320"," Or if they pin this, NQ comes down in blood baths, the S&P 500."
"19899960","19902440"," So that's an issue as well, right?"
"19902660","19904980"," That is an issue, right?"
"19911880","19918740"," Is there a trap being laid in the overnight on NDX on NQ specifically, right?"
"19918940","19924160"," So is there a trap here into tomorrow on the marketplace?"
"19924640","19926020"," How do you set that trap up?"
"19926060","19928840"," I'm going to show up to you how you set that trap up. "
"19929520","19935040"," And what you do is you buy a shit ton of puts, zero dates, not puts you to call zero"
"19935040","19935420"," dates."
"19936140","19940480"," And you make the trade like this, you come into the marketplace, right?"
"19941400","19947640"," And you load up on in the money calls here, you pin the market into the clothes, right?"
"19947880","19949400"," Just pin, pin, pin, pin, pin."
"19949780","19955120"," And then you let the daily roll over on NASDAQ in the middle of the night. "
"19955540","19960940"," And you roll this market down below the hourly trigger and have a bloodbath for tomorrow."
"19962020","19966680"," So into the clothes here, what are we looking at here to happen, right?"
"19966940","19970760"," So into this clothes here, bulls need to hold on."
"19972920","19977480"," Well, it's like a Dix really quick too, because this is the one thing, this is what this is kind"
"19977480","19978540"," of bullish, believe it or not. "
"19980600","19989680"," So on Dix, we'll take a look at Dix really is the summer trade."
"19990680","19992160"," 15 minute might show up better."
"19993820","19997040"," So on Dix, we're seeing higher lows, right?"
"19997660","19998880"," Higher low, higher, higher low. "
"19999300","20004360"," But even so, you're seeing this move up and down, up and down, up and down nonsense, right?"
"20006220","20009720"," So just Dix right now, it's the summer trade, right?"
"20010760","20012120"," Something like that, right?"
"20014320","20019060"," And truthfully, I want to take a look at, is it, I do it on this one right here."
"20020640","20022180"," I'll just show you, or Dixie."
"20026140","20028600"," Dixie, we had a high back here of 104, 46. "
"20029160","20030620"," Dixie's looking bullish too, right?"
"20031620","20036440"," We know there's sellers up here, but we don't ever want to see one here."
"20038600","20042120"," So this 105 up here, but this is looking bullish, right?"
"20042840","20049880"," This is Dixie's telling you that, yeah, if we keep doing this up here, this will actually take us"
"20049880","20050500"," down at 432."
"20051240","20056060"," This would, if we traded that 405, that 105, it's showing pretty bare signs here, right?"
"20056320","20058700"," Showing you to look out below. "
"20059520","20069320"," So on spoos specifically, to a finite chart, on spoos specifically, we talked"
"20069320","20070960"," about this on Saturday, right?"
"20071480","20075460"," We did a Saturday show, and what did I say to you?"
"20075720","20077640"," Who can recall what I said on the Saturday show?"
"20077820","20079580"," We did a private stream on Saturday."
"20079820","20081000"," What did I say to you on Saturday?"
"20083400","20084340"," You guys remember?"
"20086880","20093180"," What I said to you on the Saturday stream was, I'm expecting Monday to be bullish, right?"
"20095680","20104380"," And it really is going to matter here on my bullishness on Saturday, or Monday, excuse me, really"
"20104380","20105500"," is going to matter here."
"20105900","20106800"," What happens here?"
"20107580","20109000"," Does it just get sold down?"
"20109600","20111280"," Does it just get sold down here?"
"20112140","20116360"," So into this close today, and I said, yeah, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday is really going to be"
"20116360","20119160"," critical for bulls. "
"20119540","20120320"," This is their last chance."
"20120400","20121160"," They got no more chances."
"20122500","20126380"," Yeah, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, they got one more chance left. "
"20128660","20139760"," So if this gets sold off, if and as long as price remains below 447, 44,"
"20145780","20152640"," right, price target, 432 to 428, thinking along it takes."
"20153280","20156160"," The quicker we get there, the easier we'll hit 428."
"20157580","20161920"," The target though is to the downside at 432 to 428. "
"20163540","20173400"," Now, if price breaks above, does that mean that we still don't have a price target of"
"20173400","20174380"," 432 to 428?"
"20176260","20179520"," No, it's not good enough to squeeze up here."
"20180440","20187760"," You have to hold the hourly above the daily for confirmation of trend reversal to the upside."
"20188860","20194140"," So you want to see the squeeze up here, you want to see price hold the hourly and begin to"
"20194140","20199340"," make its way up, start to close all this bullshit, and then the bunch of shit way back there. "
"20199760","20201620"," But you need this to happen as a bull."
"20201860","20205060"," And it's not good for like as a bull, it's not good for you right now."
"20205720","20208420"," Now, you see the seller stepping in here, right?"
"20208740","20211580"," And they're going to do this to you because of the rage that they have. "
"20211960","20214880"," They want that second leg down in the marketplace."
"20215340","20216160"," They want it bad."
"20216820","20217540"," Really bad. "
"20217720","20218440"," Now, do they get it?"
"20220640","20227600"," The PPO is saying no, PMO is saying, yeah, I think PPO is saying one of one of them is"
"20227600","20228180"," saying yes."
"20228740","20230120"," The other one is saying no."
"20230720","20233060"," They're saying that we're at this inflection point. "
"20233240","20236380"," They're saying that we're at a like a do or die point in the marketplace."
"20237000","20244560"," We could go down to four to 432, or we could go up to, or we could hold this and"
"20244560","20245260"," continue higher."
"20245600","20248160"," Now, I'm going to say something to you. "
"20249280","20252600"," We still have not broken trend if we trade 432."
"20254060","20260080"," But I would be and I will be limiting my expectations to the upside into September."
"20260720","20265660"," I will limit my expectations to the upside into January 1st. "
"20266420","20274060"," And I would also look for a deeper low in February if bulls do not hold this."
"20274800","20281320"," So, you're talking about like we're many steps ahead of being there, but you have to think about"
"20281320","20286300"," what the implications are to losing this is my point."
"20286660","20294700"," If you lose this here and you're a buyer and you lose this, you're going to have to reevaluate"
"20296320","20303880"," everything from this point forward out into likely March, maybe even April of next year. "
"20304160","20305560"," It's a pretty significant thing, right?"
"20305820","20312800"," You're talking about us being in in August right now and having at least, you know, a significant"
"20312800","20315020"," amount of time left inside the rest of this year."
"20315480","20321740"," And then we've got more down the road stuff, seven, eight months ahead, pretty much being decided"
"20321740","20322760"," right now."
"20324020","20328620"," Pretty much being decided right where we are going back into Thursday. "
"20328620","20336900"," So, more back in the matter of fact, the decision was started right here on Thursday."
"20337380","20347100"," So, this whole structure right here is telling you to at least think about, hey, is that upside"
"20347100","20347960"," target still valid?"
"20348660","20352620"," Or do we pull that upside target expectations to the downside?"
"20353060","20358000"," And furthermore, you're going to see fear kick in if this happens."
"20358820","20361120"," So, you'll see fear actually end for the market. "
"20361320","20369960"," You'll see large, large funds say, eh, let's start lowering our expectations to end of year."
"20370500","20374520"," Let's start to look towards February of having major lows as well."
"20374880","20381200"," If you're looking for like 4,000 or 42 in February with that upside tag, right?"
"20381700","20385100"," You're not going to be looking for like 3,800 into February. "
"20385420","20389400"," So, this is important here, right?"
"20389860","20393300"," So, this is all I'm paying attention to."
"20393420","20396700"," I have more money on the market here than zero dates."
"20396700","20406580"," I have a significant amount of money watching this going. "
"20406960","20409040"," Yeah, we'll have to start hedging at some point."
"20410000","20412680"," My hat hedges on until this last push up."
"20413220","20421440"," Those went to zeros, but right here makes me think, yeah, you know, is this a place now where I"
"20421440","20427160"," have to hedge into March or June?"
"20428020","20429680"," Do I have to put a major hedge in the market?"
"20430200","20437660"," Let's put on a putback spread that's many months out, seven months out, something like that with"
"20437660","20440380"," significant amount of money, especially I'm going to stay long here. "
"20441160","20442420"," So, or do I cut all of them?"
"20442500","20444680"," The other thing I went through this two weeks ago, I'm like, do I cut?"
"20445380","20447700"," I'm like, do I cut my holdings in the S&P 500?"
"20448000","20448660"," Just get rid of them?"
"20448900","20452000"," Is this just a pain trade for what I'm in this market?"
"20453180","20457420"," Do I just wrap it up and go home and come back in the springtime, put no money in the"
"20457420","20457580"," market."
"20457820","20460660"," Just trade zero dates, trade spreads, that kind of stuff."
"20461500","20464900"," So, this is kind of a big point in the marketplace for where we are. "
"20465000","20467140"," You should see this play out today and tomorrow."
"20467400","20468720"," Now, I'm going to say something here."
"20469960","20472920"," I want to say something here. "
"20473000","20476720"," I'm going to make this really quick and simple for you or easy for you."
"20478260","20479580"," The weebull chart on fullscreen."
"20480280","20485740"," If you are a seller, you are in control, right?"
"20486940","20489220"," All you have to hold is this daily trigger. "
"20489520","20494460"," You might be able to both can squeeze above the daily trigger because of NASDAQ and where it's at."
"20494640","20498200"," You might see a bigger squeeze up in tomorrow."
"20498720","20503700"," My one fear here is that the setup is to the downside for a bloodbath tomorrow. "
"20503900","20504900"," So, I'm watching this closely."
"20505940","20511060"," I'm watching this very closely here to find out what's going to take place into tomorrow."
"20511900","20517420"," So, if I was looking for a downside target in a Friday, if I'm looking for a downside target into"
"20517420","20527080"," Friday, if the sellers draw a trap, it's going to be 440 by Friday"
"20527080","20528380"," as a downside target. "
"20528600","20532160"," So, 440 by Friday for a downside target."
"20532160","20535880"," Likely 438 would be even on tap if we can get some real blood going."
"20538140","20540400"," Still holding 448 Cs. "
"20541400","20543860"," So, big days ahead, right?"
"20544040","20549340"," We've got today or we've got, into end of week, you've got the main screen here."
"20550320","20552580"," So, kind of like decision making, right?"
"20553500","20562780"," So, if at any point, this daily trigger."
"20562960","20564780"," Now, Bello is saying we can go up here. "
"20564940","20566380"," Bello is saying, yeah, we can go up here."
"20566940","20568100"," It's more indecision."
"20568200","20573780"," It's not directionally like, yeah, we're going down or yeah, we're going up anything like that. "
"20573980","20583170"," There's none of that like, there's none of like, yeah, hey, we've rejected we're going down."
"20583990","20587590"," But there is, hey, this is like, you got nothing."
"20588150","20594130"," And I'm going to be honest with you. "
"20594130","20599030"," Because if they're actually buying this market, that's real money buying, you're going to know it."
"20600170","20605570"," And if it, if bulls don't real money buy this market, it's going to sell hard and heavy."
"20606130","20608290"," So, I'm looking for price here. "
"20608930","20610490"," So, when you're like, why are you buying calls?"
"20610850","20612250"," Why are you looking for a squeeze up here?"
"20612910","20616310"," It's because I'm looking for that real money volume buying right now."
"20616370","20621510"," I'm looking for like, we're going up, take the hedge off market and correction over."
"20621810","20624310"," You've already seen the correction in NASDAQ. "
"20625030","20627550"," They've already come down and tagged most of their weekly triggers."
"20628390","20630610"," So, I'm still on bull here."
"20630670","20631510"," I'm not on bear yet. "
"20631790","20636470"," So, I am fascinated though, into this close and fascinated into tomorrow."
"20637450","20640310"," If this is a place to put a hedge on the market."
"20641510","20651310"," Now, so bulls, currently bulls need to hold 446, 40 and sellers need to hold 447, 48"
"20651310","20653570"," to find out which way we're headed. "
"20654230","20655810"," Personally, I'm on the bull side here."
"20656470","20659510"," I don't think they're willing to give this up at this point."
"20660530","20666150"," I don't think that I don't, my thought process here, not feelings or anything, just thought process"
"20666150","20670930"," here is that this market is not, historically, it's not ready to go down at this point. "
"20671290","20675290"," It's supposed to, it's supposed to inflict maximum pain and fear into the marketplace."
"20676250","20679130"," It's supposed to be hard to get to the top."

"20689630","20691630"," I'm going to give it to the bulls here."
"20692310","20695730"," And I'm like, what, what if 440s for Friday costs?"
"20696830","20697450"," How cheap are they?"
"20697670","20698610"," Super cheap or the expensive?"
"20706990","20709450"," It's like 440, 61 cents, man."
"20709650","20711550"," Those are expensive. "
"20713070","20715050"," They're expensive puts for Friday."
"20718550","20719270"," What are 440s costs?"
"20720650","20726630"," US 10-year tips yield rises to 1.8 to 7% the highest since 2009."
"20727490","20729190"," Yeah, 60 fucking cents. "
"20729570","20730530"," You're out of your fucking minds."
"20731110","20734430"," You're out of your fucking minds if you buy those."
"20736190","20738630"," You're out of your fucking minds right now. "
"20741110","20742890"," I never bought those puts, man."
"20743530","20744970"," These puts are now two pennies."
"20745250","20746710"," Thank God I didn't buy those things. "
"20756040","20758000"," Trying to crush my calls right now."
"20760860","20763220"," They're right on the clothes here."
"20767030","20774170"," So I guess my point here, my further point here would be, what do I expect for the rest of"
"20774170","20774330"," the week?"
"20775090","20776570"," Sellers are in charge right now. "
"20777010","20779670"," Need to break and hold above the daily trigger."
"20779870","20784150"," Need hourly to come up and push us higher for more bullish stance."
"20784530","20785770"," Otherwise sellers are in control. "
"20786650","20791150"," They can begin to break below that 446-40 downside target."
"20791470","20794190"," 440-438."
"20806130","20808190"," Yeah, I watch, I watch, XLF looks great. "
"20809170","20810790"," XLF is bullish as fuck right now."
"20811730","20812770"," Bullish as fuck."
"20813850","20815570"," XLF looks outstanding right now. "
"20816830","20818210"," XLF is what's telling me."
"20819390","20822150"," XLF is telling me why it will keep me bullish."
"20823150","20826890"," XLF is like one of the small shining bright stars out there. "
"20827650","20829410"," I'm extremely bullish because of XLF."
"20830230","20832190"," XLF is telling me that this market is fine."
"20834430","20836170"," It's telling me that it's perfectly fine. "
"20836350","20838390"," There's no problems with the market right now."
"20839930","20844650"," XLF is like one of the, one of like the risk off type sectors that I'm always watching."
"20845230","20847090"," Like we're actually in risk off or not. "
"20847390","20849890"," We're starting to break through that daily trigger on XLF."
"20850410","20852090"," We haven't, we've put bouncing off it."
"20852190","20853910"," Just like bouncing, bouncing, bouncing. "
"20855530","20857550"," Talked earlier about that with regional banks, right?"
"20857830","20860250"," They might be a good indicator for, for risk off or not."
"20860990","20864010"," And XLF is just holding itself up right now."
"20877740","20879360"," Let me look at H5G real quick. "
"20879860","20880920"," I'm watching my calls right now."
"20880940","20883120"," I'm getting, I'm getting ground to dust right now."
"20884100","20885500"," Straight ground to dust. "
"20885700","20887240"," I'm not like three pennies right now, my calls."
"20888360","20889920"," I'm going to hold them right into the bell."
"20900720","20901520"," H5G looks good. "
"20902320","20903360"," H5G looks just fine."
"20903600","20904020"," Looks real good."
"20922790","20924790"," Well, I'm looking at that bear town up there. "
"20924970","20930390"," Like 105.08. Like bear town on, on Dixie."
"20930650","20932670"," I've got like 104.78. 108."
"20933570","20936290"," 105.43. And then the real nasties. "
"20936990","20941370"," 107.30. That'd be like market crash."
"20943210","20945370"," That'd be like straight market crash."
"20946790","20949270"," I've had that bear town up there for like months. "
"20951730","20955670"," Like what let's, let me show you Dixie really quick or XLF really quick."
"20957890","20960250"," So like this is XLF."
"20961330","20962450"," So look at XLF. "
"20962730","20963070"," Just parked."
"20964870","20965750"," So this is XLF."
"20965750","20969890"," And it's just parked heading higher too. "
"20971390","20972290"," It's heading higher."
"20972430","20977270"," It's stair stepping up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, not down, up."
"20979110","20980730"," So we'll keep watching this. "
"20982610","20987610"," You have to, so if you're a bear right, you have to get underneath 3473 on XLF."
"20988530","20990250"," It's like your magic number in XLF."
"20991330","20992810"," It still has not happened. "
"21005120","21006120"," Still long in this close."
"21006580","21010580"," If my calls burn, if they could grind this in a dust, I'm going to buy the close here too."
"21011200","21013220"," So I'll buy the one dates for the close. "
"21023070","21026030"," Now 230, you have my expectations for the rest of this week."
"21028110","21029870"," You want to know what I think we're doing with the rest of the week?"
"21029870","21030370"," We're going out."
"21030550","21032070"," I don't think that this market sells. "
"21032950","21035510"," I don't think it's ready to sell these enough reason for it."
"21035610","21042230"," So I think there's reason for it to consolidate until we can trade higher, but I'm on team."
"21042530","21043350"," We go up, not team. "
"21043450","21043770"," We go down."
"21050220","21053520"," Now will my, will my thought process change on that?"
"21053900","21054480"," Fuck yeah."
"21055060","21058820"," Start closing underneath today, 446, 46. "
"21059760","21061380"," And it's going to be a bloodbath."
"21061580","21063040"," It's going to get really nasty to the downside."
"21064080","21066860"," So until that happens, I'm a dip buyer down here. "
"21066860","21071180"," And we'll see when, we'll see when we get that return to the scene of crime when I get paid."
"21071420","21075080"," So remember that scene of the crime happens?"
"21076000","21077040"," Probably going to take a vacation."
"21078020","21083500"," So looking out to the early market on close imbalance, probably going to be able to take a"
"21083500","21083580"," vacation. "
"21085100","21088260"," Kind of sitting at 182 million to the south side."
"21090420","21093120"," 330 now, half an hour left until the end of the day."
"21106430","21109130"," Now is that still holding up on the hourly trigger. "
"21109970","21111790"," Half hour momentum coming up from underneath."
"21114710","21120490"," I feel like I'm playing poker with dealers here."
"21122230","21125090"," Not necessarily with sellers, but dealers that don't want to pay. "
"21131500","21132980"," That's what I feel like I'm playing with here."
"21133220","21135000"," I feel like I'm playing fuck around with dealers."
"21136920","21140240"," And I think dealers want me to be like, yeah, take the yellow and walk away. "
"21140400","21142020"," And I'll be like, fuck, no, I'm going to buy another one."
"21142040","21143140"," I'm going to buy another fucking round."
"21144660","21146440"," That's my thought process here. "
"21158850","21163970"," So now there's 436,000 calls."
"21165470","21170350"," And so these are the ones that I've been talking to you about since earlier this afternoon."
"21173770","21176290"," And they're now worth 21 cents. "
"21177570","21184890"," So just murder, murder, are not allowing these calls to close in the money."
"21185150","21186310"," They're just loading them up now."
"21187190","21189090"," Just loading them the fuck up right here. "
"21189770","21194830"," And this forces the market to the downside of the bell, the sideways trade."
"21200140","21201800"," Pinning in the marketplace right now."
"21207390","21208530"," Yeah, my child is dead. "
"21208630","21209270"," I can't see shit."
"21210050","21213330"," My child has been dead for like 45 minutes an hour."
"21213710","21214730"," I'd like to stop rolling. "
"21215410","21216830"," I'm probably with streamlabs."
"21311710","21313270"," Well, that's not what they're doing."
"21313910","21314870"," Holy shit. "
"21339440","21341740"," I guess Elon was wrong, wasn't he?"
"21400240","21401480"," Squeeze and I are right now."
"21407960","21427590"," What do you guys know about a verified organization"
"21427590","21431550"," cost 10 grand, but it might not cost 10 grand?"
"21435090","21437410"," Trading 447.07 right now."
"21437650","21459490"," 447.06 bouncing around. "
"21466000","21472720"," I was told that Elon gave away some organizational check marks with your logo."
"21475620","21477480"," For free and he's not charging."
"21477900","21478400"," Is that real?"
"21493700","21495560"," I'm going to tell you something out there, okay?"
"21496320","21499380"," They run this up into this bell like little creepy crawly wall up the wall. "
"21501540","21503260"," Yeah, I'm going to tell you, right?"
"21503380","21504500"," I don't think that they do, but they do."
"21505980","21508720"," If they do the creepy crawly up the wall today, right?"
"21511200","21513360"," If they print those goddamn calls, right?"
"21513800","21514940"," I ain't streaming for you tomorrow."
"21515620","21516320"," Taking the week off. "
"21517240","21519200"," I'm going to spend some money, okay?"
"21520100","21521600"," Just like praying hope."
"21527170","21529230"," Praying hope that it doesn't do the creepy crawly up the wall."
"21531730","21534270"," It's like sit there and go, please don't crop the wall in the bell. "
"21552780","21554920"," We get the creepy crawly right now in the wall."
"21555900","21558880"," I'm going to be like end stream."
"21559580","21560160"," See you guys later. "
"21575100","21576600"," They do that creepy crawly."
"21577100","21578600"," I know how they do this shit too."
"21578720","21582800"," It's like you weren't long here. "
"21583020","21583480"," Sorry, buddy."
"21588840","21590760"," You guys know what the creepy crawly wall is."
"21592240","21593820"," I don't think that they do it here today. "
"21595240","21598880"," I don't see it happening, but if they were to do it, it'd be hilarious."
"21599940","21602040"," Like every like nine or ten times they will."
"21604260","21606200"," It's like one out of one out of ten times. "
"21606440","21608620"," All those calls in the money right now they normally don't."
"21608780","21609080"," It doesn't matter."
"21609200","21610320"," It's like what's calls doesn't matter. "
"21612500","21613500"," Sometimes they do."
"21614060","21617000"," Look at those sellers up there."
"21617080","21617340"," Look at these. "
"21617540","21620140"," Look at these ruthless, these angry sellers up here."
"21628700","21633580"," All you need though is one big invisible hand to be like whoop all by it all."
"21645230","21647730"," Come on S&P vigilantes. "
"21650550","21653610"," Come on S&P 500, 100."
"21654750","21656970"," That's the P 500 vigilantes."
"21657390","21658350"," Move the market. "
"21658830","21660170"," Some of you guys know where those guys are."
"21665680","21667000"," Daily trigger right here."
"21669480","21670520"," Check spoos. "
"21673800","21675580"," Oh, would it be funny?"
"21681170","21682730"," Early mark on close imbalance."
"21683150","21685730"," Currently sitting at 202 million to the sell side."
"21685850","21686290"," 20 minutes left. "
"21693180","21694320"," Still holding these calls."
"21695360","21697140"," It rolls back down to the spell."
"21697560","21698740"," It'll look for zero date. "
"21698920","21700880"," Well, one date today but zero dates for tomorrow."
"21703640","21705380"," 448s still sitting on them."
"21711380","21715220"," I'm not going to make my mistake though this week. "
"21716620","21721960"," Last week, two weeks ago, I don't know, it's been two weeks I think."
"21723500","21726420"," Two weeks ago, I had a winner into the close."
"21727700","21729160"," It was actually a winner. "
"21730700","21732640"," That was up like 100% or something."
"21733440","21735560"," Yeah, but it wasn't long enough to close them out."
"21736820","21738580"," I put a sell-in but it didn't fill. "
"21738960","21742120"," It was like, it was like a green bar like this."
"21745280","21747880"," I was like, so, so, so, so, so, so, so it didn't sell."
"21748300","21749680"," When it came back down, it was still up. "
"21753490","21758570"," But I let them close at 4.15 and they fucking zeroed them on me."
"21759570","21761170"," I was so fucking pissed."
"21763310","21771910"," They fucking dumped me into a pile between 4.15 and 6 p.m. I was pretty angry about it. "
"21773170","21774630"," Called my broker though, got him money."
"21774990","21777690"," So, I'm happy but I'm just fucking limited."
"21781250","21783750"," They do that creepy crawly up the wall and the left my ass up. "
"21784270","21787230"," We're up like 30 points just in the middle, just in the middle here."
"21789070","21790110"," You fucking awesome."
"21790470","21791670"," Just like straight fucking. "
"21798160","21799040"," Nasdaq again."
"21800660","21801100"," Testing."
"21802140","21802960"," The highs. "
"21815470","21817470"," Yeah, I'm trying to be a buyer here."
"21818150","21821630"," I'm not anti-s going down to 4.32. I'm not like against it."
"21821650","21822450"," I wouldn't mind it either. "
"21823190","21828190"," I'm not like, hey, I don't want us to go to 4.32 but it has implications down the road."
"21829190","21829910"," It's the bigger point."
"21830150","21838230"," Like the bigger point here is you likely don't recover from 4.32 and trade 4.70. High probability. "
"21839090","21842490"," You could trade 4.70 December 31st."
"21843470","21846990"," But if you think you're like getting an all-time high, that shit's gone."
