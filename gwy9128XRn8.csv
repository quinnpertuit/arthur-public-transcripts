"486730","491910"," we're up like what 20 30 points And then we start to sell off this morning."
"491910","497630"," We didn't saw we got a green bar in the open that is to be expected this morning But at"
"497630","500910"," the same time we're not we're not legging it up right now, right?"

"536030","541490"," There'll be there'll be some form around I believe it's two o'clock of weakness, right?"
"541710","547810"," We'll we'll we'll go down drastically And then we will either Trade higher, right?"
"548050","553230"," This is if we think we got good news or we'll sometimes spring higher to grab short And then we"
"553230","559930"," start to trade down in a day even on good days good FMC days We tend to let's say we"
"559930","561190"," have that weakness there, right?"
"562450","563930"," So we trade up here today. "
"564090","567930"," Let's see up this three to two In intraday trading."
"568150","574570"," Let's just say we trade in this zone here today You usually see some weakness heading in FOM and to"
"574570","578350"," the FOMC statement And let's say it's a good statement, right?"
"579350","585650"," and we trade higher and then right around 230 j-pau speech starts and It gets ugly."

"602850","610770"," see some some positivity in the days leading thereafter But the event risk is over and also the"
"610770","614790"," trade is over right the volatility of the trade is over There's compression of volatility. "
"615210","621370"," So you really want to capture this trade here Today and take your money and run at some point."

"663470","668790"," a common occurrence on FOMC You'll see this this kind of a move play out and then later on the"
"668790","674110"," week You'll end up seeing a trade higher or a trade lower depending upon Well, the trade lower"
"674110","682650"," would actually start typically in this FOMC into Friday if it's a good FOMC You'll normally want to"

"893630","902190"," We talked about They're being a failure between 4 10 and 430 In the overnight if we got a 420"
"902190","907830"," we got 420 on an es overnight over here So you could say you could technically say we got right"
"907830","908670"," in the halfway mark."
"908870","917050"," We still rolled and failed down here Hold on here So there's big failure down here, right?"
"917410","922010"," We knew this failure was coming this wasn't there was nothing surprising about this I think"
"922010","924890"," accounts blown up and I even talked and we said this looks like distribution."
"925410","932090"," This looks like it's coming down We know we knew that this would fail at some point over here so"
"932090","940710"," let me close that up real quick and We've got larger issues to be a turn that off On a"
"940710","950670"," longer time scale let me actually turn that back on again And a lot on a lot"
"950670","951790"," on a longer time frame. "
"951910","964520"," Let me put this vertical bar in here This"
"964520","968800"," over to the 17th Here and what's going on here."
"969120","975480"," It's a mockiness going on here So you can see here right in this longer time frame that we had"
"975480","982920"," this break Okay, you can see this Brit this nice break we had you stayed in this channel All right,"
"983120","985500"," we haven't been able to break out of this channel."
"985760","989920"," This is the pet news dependent headline news dependent Ukraine war, right?"
"990360","994380"," News dependent on the Fed Making a different shift, right?"
"995340","1003380"," Without that shift we are trading Inside of this channel, right and this this larger channel if we"
"1003380","1007020"," look on this larger channel It's actually not on this one. "
"1007080","1020700"," There it is right there See this larger channel down below here miss larger"
"1020700","1029099"," channel, right brings us Down into See how I 320 down in here pretty nasty."
"1029599","1038190"," It's really ugly Nobody wants to see that 320 We start to see these downward projections, right?"
"1038790","1039770"," You got 320 here."
"1040349","1043510"," You got 360 here You've got 358 over here. "
"1043750","1046410"," You see this break that we had down below, right?"
"1047190","1051490"," Like sitting and bring this back You can see this break that we have here, right?"
"1051770","1057830"," If we don't have a change from the Fed right the Fed doesn't bring in a Fed But we are"
"1057830","1064510"," we are bound to fail again higher We know we got some gaps to fill above here at this at"
"1064510","1072770"," this 400 somewhere in this 400 So the expectation would be if the Fed increases our Our rates,"
"1073010","1079470"," right if the if he's pulling forward or on track to still trade Down in a lot in a larger"
"1079470","1085650"," time frame But if the Fed pulls forward we go up to 75 BPS or 100 or says we're not"
"1085650","1091350"," pulling forward Just adding another 25 BPS to the already 50 we're still on track to trade this"
"1091350","1097590"," market down So you're gonna expect even if we fill a gap for another failure and for us that trade"
"1097590","1108610"," down over time Into this 320 Same as before same as before same on a larger time frame Going"
"1108610","1114590"," back into January I think we will continue this downward trend over time, right?"
"1114590","1119950"," At this try this roll over here this distribution Right is going to continue."
"1120490","1122250"," Where does it where does it end right here?"
"1122410","1126890"," I guess somebody abolts gonna think oh, yeah, we're just gonna trade up here cap We're gonna go all"
"1126890","1131890"," in a 420 and then roll this over Something like this pick up we're gonna go back up here and"
"1131890","1135410"," try to grab that 450 and then roll it over But none of that's really happened."
"1135810","1138530"," We've stayed on track You can see these marks here. "
"1138930","1144710"," You see this mark here We see this mark at 370 and quite get to 360 But we are looking"
"1144710","1150510"," to trade this down for this failure into July get down to this three four if it takes up till"
"1150510","1157330"," July Right, it'll be 340 if it takes into August to get down here It gets down even or maybe"
"1157330","1163190"," that's 360 and then down here is 340 So eventually you keep rolling this down and at one point"
"1163190","1168150"," there should be a break when you have these bottoms down here That's that capitulation break,"
"1168150","1168450"," right?"
"1168830","1170050"," We haven't seen that right?"
"1170310","1175170"," We've stayed on trend We are at some point going to look for that capitulation break So that could"
"1175170","1180530"," come today if we get an ugly FMC There's nothing to say we don't get that final capitulation break"
"1180530","1185490"," and then make a make a make a nice bull run higher We haven't seen that yet."
"1185610","1187510"," We haven't seen that down below."
"1187710","1188470"," We haven't seen it here. "
"1188910","1191370"," We did see a lower low over here This is not healthy."
"1192110","1193590"," We saw this massive break here."
"1193930","1197170"," This right here is a market break We are in a bear market now. "
"1197430","1202650"," You know that right so nothing is saying that we're trading higher nothing Nothing has said that"
"1202650","1203290"," since January."
"1203490","1209350"," There's nothing on the bull side saying that we're trading higher This is the fucking bottom of the"
"1209350","1209670"," market."
"1209870","1216250"," There's nothing saying that unless we have a fed pivot unless you have The Ukraine if you have a"
"1216250","1222090"," sensation of war in Ukraine You're gonna you're gonna possibly see that you might see a 300 point"
"1222090","1227690"," run But we're still coming back in on your break of Ukraine news breaks that they have ceased"
"1229090","1232550"," Hostilities in a truce is there and they're gonna reopen trade. "
"1233350","1238910"," I Could be a bump to the market, but it still doesn't change the fact Of a fed fed pivot"
"1238910","1245550"," and so you get the fed pivot fed put of some kind or we break something There's major damage done"
"1245550","1253710"," to this market unreal major damage done to this market You got it."
"1253830","1262130"," You got to see that you've got Hedge funds that liquidated you've got banks coming into an end-of "

"4435540","4441640"," 377p's expiring today You'll see the me actually jump off and switch sometimes to calls They'll"
"4441640","4445940"," jump from the call side to the put side depending on where they're trying to steer the market So"
"4445940","4450500"," they're still in those puts right now Uh, but i'll keep let's say i want i'm a bull so i'm"
"4450500","4456500"," buying dips Right i'm typically a bull i don't like buying puts because they don't pay like a call"
"4456500","4462460"," pays None of the structure puts are not built or designed Uh to make you money they can make money"
"4462460","4466860"," if the market rolls over for a couple days But they don't make the kind of money that a call"
"4466860","4472680"," makes If you don't believe me on that i'll post that article on the theory of calls and puts and"
"4472680","4479520"," how they how they pay money, okay So let's say i'm let's say for today for intraday trading i'm"
"4479520","4489860"," looking for a top right 380c is what i'm watching So 380c Right now is worth a dollar 89 I've"
"4489860","4495940"," been watching that 380c since the open i know what people paid for those 380c's yesterday at the"
"4495940","4501560"," close I know what they fucking paid for them at the opening bell today I know how far upside down"
"4501560","4506400"," there are how much pain there is on that trade Right and how cheap i want to buy it at"
"4506400","4511860"," on the uh expiration date if it's a zero day to one day to three dates I want to know"
"4511860","4513720"," like is this cheap right now?"
"4514280","4520260"," Right it's what it's the delta is a 35 delta right it's pretty decent delta i'm looking at the"
"4520260","4526120"," delta on that option And how when is it going to expire it's going to expire today Right at the"
"4526120","4530300"," end of the day they're costing a lot of money the market makers are building in the dealers are"
"4530300","4536020"," saying these are worth two bucks On an fmc day they probably are worth two bucks Dollar e five"
"4536020","4541740"," dollar 75 makes sense until the event takes place or leading into the event or even after the event"
"4542280","4546920"," How cheap can i get that 384 today can i get it a dollar can i get it at 60"
"4546920","4552300"," cents is it going to be a rollover At one o'clock 130 in the afternoon is there going to"
"4552300","4559300"," be is there a point where i sell where i know that that option is up 100 200 300 if"
"4559300","4563840"," i don't watch that option all day long let's say i don't look at the 380 sees me bell in"
"4563840","4568620"," the opening bell right and all of a sudden Uh the three we were let's say it's in the money"
"4568620","4575080"," at 380 in the full in the uh 384 c Is now at that 35 delta but it's up to"
"4575080","4577400"," like three bucks or four bucks."
"4577740","4581600"," I know it's overpriced Don't be buying that overpriced option."
"4581840","4587000"," That's a 35 delta now So there's i don't know if i'm explaining this correctly but uh watch the"
"4587000","4594020"," options that you're interested in watch the options where the key is Day in day out start watching"
"4594020","4600620"," options that are that you're interested in trading they're pricing For the day and then also watch"
"4600620","4605640"," the options at the hft's that the algorithms are on as they bounce back and forth throughout the"
"4605640","4611500"," day And then over some time you're gonna figure out you will figure out what's cheap and what's not"
"4611500","4618620"," cheap And if you do this day in day a weekend week out you start to find You start to"
"4618620","4624680"," find that Uh, you know when they you know that in this cycle of one to three days zero zero"
"4624680","4629020"," to three days Uh when they're actually cheap and when they're not and the general direction of the"
"4629020","4632880"," market If it's going in that direction when you should be buying them when you should be dumping"
"4632880","4637260"," them I think i don't know if swaggy socks does this anymore you don't have to pay for it now,"
"4637260","4644460"," but I think back in the day Uh swaggy socks is the show a graph And how options lose money"
"4644460","4648120"," over time And the graph is a descending graph, right?"
"4648520","4654800"," There's a descending options descending lose money So if you were to start at let's say a 10,"
"4654920","4658060"," right, uh, let's say this is just a theoretical. "
"4658360","4665140"," Let's say 10 weeks You'll see it options value start at 10 bucks every week and lose a dollar right"
"4665140","4667340"," down to one dollar Into the last week."
"4667600","4673020"," Let's say As a baseline and then if the if the stock market's going in your direction in that"
"4673020","4676180"," option You'll see you'll see a curve, right?"
"4676360","4680860"," You'll see you'll see a sine wave that goes up and down up and down That shows you the best"
"4680860","4685660"," times you should have bought that option Uh, and that's a visual representation of just watching"
"4685660","4689080"," options charts Uh, so let's say with the stock markets going up."
"4689420","4693860"," I want to buy the bottom of that sine wave Uh, and then sell the top of that sine wave"
"4693860","4700560"," in that in that time frame Uh, some people will tell you oh, I bought some System spy puts or"
"4700560","4706980"," something and they've been doing great at hetumson's january I hear that bull shit And they're not"
"4706980","4713600"," really capturing Uh, their value as time you want to be walking in the profits on those puts And"
"4713600","4719200"," then rebying above ones to become cheap again Because all options eventually go to not all should"
"4719200","4727340"," sit at 70% of options Uh, end up going to zero At some point in their light And then"
"4727340","4733900"," I'm going I'm I'm understating this right now Nice little bounce on the spy right now Uh, we'll"
"4733900","4748820"," check and see if what we can take this to P78"

"5235200","5244680"," Into an event so as time wears on let's 1147 Uh oftentimes what you'll see is you'll see You'll see"
"5244680","5250260"," bears buy some puts right they get trapped in You'll see some bulls buy some calls they'll get"
"5250260","5260100"," trapped in as we head into that event And then we'll trade sideways for a period of time Uh"
"5260100","5269600"," this today 130 usually one to 130 Usually 130 in the afternoon So you'll get people that buy early"
"5270260","5278120"," puts they'll buy calls early They won't take profit and as that runway runs out what you'll see is"

"5307100","5314340"," snap below is usually a good time to buy calls Even if we're going to sell the market Uh But"
"5314340","5318720"," no matter what it's a good time when at first dump is usually a good time to buy calls The"
"5318720","5326280"," key is that if the If the report was bad we typically still get a rip higher And that's for"
"5326280","5334120"," banks to grab uh liquidity And good positioning on shorts right greed right you'll still see that"
"5334120","5341320"," rip higher and then we'll sell it down Now if it's good news, we'll we'll it usually extend Uh that"

"6376500","6380940"," the legs off them Uh and then add them back on you can do that with some with some um"
"6381680","6388320"," Trading platforms so to each zone how you go about that You could do a mix of those trading"
"6388320","6392800"," strategies with adding zero dates Uh and there's a lot of money that's going to come into this"

"6486180","6492120"," spreads the way to go Uh, you know if you're a bullet that brought to protect your lungs They they"
"6492120","6499840"," either pay for themselves or protect your lungs Highly recommend them on on on a on a large implied"

"6510440","6510720"," market."
"6510720","6516800"," I agree with that Chase brought up a good point Chase said the 398 area by next week seems possible"

"6532960","6540340"," We got 420 4200 right We briefly touched 420 so we tagged right in the middle of that We started"
"6540340","6546980"," to roll the market over at that point The same thing we should attempt Right to close those gaps if"
"6546980","6551280"," I was a bank if I was a hedge fund And I wanted to get better pricing if I wanted"
"6551280","6555640"," to destroy and clear out hedging inputs So I could rebuy cheap hedging inputs."

"6564280","6568120"," before the bulls Are super fucking duper long in the market. "
"6568460","6573900"," So if the bulls think we're gonna close the gaps We'll run it up to just before we close that"
"6573900","6579200"," last gap and we're gonna reverse it down again So heading up to that 398 or so at that I"

"7730850","7731550"," excuse me. "
"7731610","7736590"," It's buying at above the ask Uh, so it's usually fast trades."
"7736750","7737810"," They have a signature to them."
"7737810","7742630"," They're matching up dark pools Uh, so you don't get all the flow that comes through and they do"
"7742630","7746470"," miss some big trades But they give two things to me. "

"7802930","7808250"," watching this hedging You should be watching this hedging for why it's a buy why it's not a sell"
"7808970","7818670"," Um, we get some excel uh puts coming in right now August 18th 33p For 3.5 million And august"

"7851010","7855890"," They tell you uh where they bought them at where you should buy them at What the the thought"
"7855890","7860150"," process behind them So if you see a golden ticket come out on a high you wait for the low"
"7860150","7866150"," and the trend If it's if the trend is down Uh, they give you a place to look to at"
"7866150","7871910"," re-enter There's reasons for that because these golden ticket buyers They'll usually buy again if"
"7871910","7876650"," the trade goes against them Uh, you might actually see like a golden ticket for 10 million And then"
"7876650","7881810"," you'll see two or three more come in down the road If the if the if the market or the"
"7881810","7886570"," trade goes sideways or down Uh, you can put more time on the trade and you usually get a print"

"8866320","8870900"," market like the bond market That's because they're not invested in the fucking equities market like"
"8870900","8877180"," they are the bond market And then whatever so there can be some divergence in the weakness of our"
"8877180","8883160"," equity market versus the bond market Uh, not a bunch, but you will sometimes see divergence in the"

"13608300","13616600"," 3.5 down the road get this right in the back here So I'll look for another entry as we"
"13616600","13624520"," head into the presser Now 3.74 was the intraday low We know also note the next low is down"
"13624520","13626320"," at 370 down here, right?"

"13677220","13682620"," event this wasn't as negative as it could be And i'm going to expect Jerome Powell to be positive"

"13706940","13714040"," into 390 Let's say or even 400 into monday You would see a more aggressive hawkish approach from"

"13964390","13968690"," Yeah, we could probably get up and clear out Uh, some of the gaps up at four 24 or four"
"13968690","13973950"," 18 or wherever that is And possibly even clear out for 10 you're probably going to see a failure"
"13973950","13979770"," somewhere because of this fomc statement Without any guidance yet from from chair pal himself. "
"13980130","13987710"," You'll see a failure of trying to clear out That three nine that 390 Possibly still 400 but likely"

"16027650","16033030"," We got some we have some sellers where the seller is at about two Do we think financial conditions"

"16081070","16093290"," So that's that's really how For the Fed and moderating In"
"16093290","16098650"," the range of plausible Numbers, I think we'll know when we get to really I mean honestly that that"
"16098650","16103310"," would be you would have positive real rates I think an inflation coming down by then."
"16103390","16108230"," I think you'd have positive real rates across the curve I think that the you know the neutral rate"
"16108230","16109110"," is over here. "
"16109110","16114690"," Okay, so I would think it would but you know what we're gonna we're gonna find that out in my"
"16114690","16120990"," We're not gonna be completely modeled driven about this We're gonna be looking at at this keeping"

"16134570","16140270"," in their approach Just neutral rate is pretty low these days to work through expectations And now"
"16140270","16145530"," obviously this decision was something quite different from how you are going to find Alka neutral"
"16145530","16150550"," rate empirically the intermeeting period And I know you just said that what changed was really the"
"16150550","16160010"," inflation data the inflation expectations 70 Something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk"
"16160010","16165430"," eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had"
"16165430","16174390"," socialized before So if you look at We look at a broad range of inflation Gary So you've got the"
"16174390","16179310"," public you've got serving as a club and of experts and and you've also got market-based And I think"
"16179310","16183710"," if you look across that term try that is down range of data Thanks for the heads up on that"
"16183710","16191250"," or go Expectations are still in the place very much in the place where Short-term so you're"
"16191250","16193110"," watching this right here, right?"
"16194030","16203070"," Here over the next couple of years Here and also as you get away The green soft buyers there"
"16203070","16208670"," sellers are really slightly A little bit in the case and I think there's a big fight going on right"
"16208670","16215090"," here He's looking to be buying all my cursor is right here a slightly lower at the 370 that even"
"16215090","16222430"," do ABC question I think it is a place for short-term inflation side But it comes down sharply over"
"16222430","16225650"," the medium term in the next few years It might be revised nonetheless."
"16226250","16231990"," It was quite by catching and we noticed that we also noticed that that we noticed that So common"
"16231990","16236730"," inflation expectations that's what we're looking at in the last week's Michigan reading was quite"
"16236730","16241010"," eye-catching So we're watching that and we're thinking This is something we need to take seriously"
"16241010","16245530"," and that is one of the factors as I mentioned one of the factors in our Deciding to move ahead"
"16245530","16251310"," with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations We're we're absolutely"
"16251310","16252570"," determined to keep them."
"16252690","16258210"," So I'm creating two right there That was one of the reasons the other was just the the CPI rating"
"16258810","16263830"," So if you saw a movement like that again another tick up in inflation expectation Come on give me"
"16263830","16264170"," some money. "

"16284910","16290190"," soon we'll be in an area where where we're I think because you get closer to the end of the"

"17459100","17466040"," Um, so my point to you is that uh, you've got a massive hedge rolling off on the 17 Keep"
"17466040","17473840"," your eyes on that You're gonna they're gonna look to buy cheap puts Okay, so you see people in bull"
"17473840","17474740"," markets lose money."
"17474740","17481140"," I shit you not you do Uh, I can fucking tell you every fucking month I'd have bulls telling me"
"17481140","17487360"," to fucking buy fucking calls up here I'd have fucking bull saying screaming at me buy calls right"
"17487360","17492900"," there Right to be like, oh, yeah buy some fucking calls right there cap You know, they'd be like,"
"17492960","17496280"," oh buy some calls cap right there buy some calls cap right there."
"17496360","17502680"," I shoot you not so Uh, you gotta as a bear you gotta you have to just like a good"
"17502680","17509240"," bull I want you guys to know that there's gonna be even in a bear market as we go down,"
"17509340","17509500"," right?"
"17509980","17518080"," Same kind of a thing, right Um, you gotta close them out reset close them out reset Right Same"
"17518080","17519120"," thing over here, right?"
"17519440","17525660"," You want to you're going to be looking for the next reset Right, I don't see we always get risk"
"17525660","17529840"," of going to foreign rates or not too far enough Now do I think we get up here to four"
"17529840","17530960"," hundred four twenty five?"
"17531000","17537200"," No, that is quite mindful of these dangers Maybe maybe you get to four hundred and the worst was"
"17537200","17542060"," safe if I could make would be to fail on inflation To this to this 385 ish is that what"
"17542060","17545880"," that is and we can find out what level that is See this little thingy big thingy right in here"
"17545880","17555880"," somewhere in here Through this 390 max 390 max I think this time So just"
"17555880","17560700"," be conscious of that as uh as the week rolls on as we get into friday and it's next week"
"17560700","17567540"," into july Um It could be there could be some uh doing yeah, we are rejecting here there could be"
"17567540","17577330"," some um Uh There could be like a sideways to up trade you've got uh ball compression I'll go on"
"17577330","17587070"," a smaller time frame here and look at it video It's funny as my last video. "
"17587270","17593510"," I did this with you guys My last video I showed you these targets and we actually traded that We"
"17593510","17596970"," actually did in my last video, uh, put plug these in for you."
"17597130","17604630"," See this see this uh This white line down these tags uh, so my point to you is though Is"
"17604630","17611730"," that um, you could see a sideways trade with low volatility heading into the 17th, right you could"
"17611730","17620370"," see Like a push up into the 17th Sideways trade into the 30th and then we start laying back down"
"17620370","17626330"," It could become come over here, but just note just note that more than likely more than likely"
"17627130","17631810"," You're getting at least something like this Before we start heading down."
"17631970","17637830"," Okay, something like that Want you to realize that as a bear Okay, now if you're a bear And you've"
"17637830","17642150"," been short since January 1st, fuck it You just stay in and you'll wait until your next leg down"
"17642150","17647070"," over here Surely though at some point up here There's going to be another another rollover and"
"17647070","17649050"," you'll probably find you go and fuck it. "
"17649070","17654910"," I'm buying calls here But you know that but that's the point same as before we talked about it"
"17654910","17661470"," before to expect 434 at the max 430 and another roll we got it and we're more than likely going"
"17661470","17666210"," to get it again over here At some point so if you're a bear and you're just like I want"
"17666210","17671110"," to buy fucking zero dates down to the depths of hell tomorrow Maybe it's possible."
"17671450","17672010"," It's possible."
"17672190","17677710"," We could trade down into into opex down here It's possible probably 30 percent chance and we bounce"
"17677710","17678630"," again sure. "
"17678950","17683610"," Oh, I'll live with that I can go with that maybe we got a new channel forming up here and"
"17683610","17689450"," this is our new channel sure all right It's we can day trade that no problem But generally speaking"
"17689450","17696290"," over the course of the course of from now until middle of july sometime I'm going to expect some"
"17696290","17703630"," kind of some kind of Clearing of hedging and then we then we trade it into um, so that's if"
"17703630","17708250"," you're a bear that should give you some Some maybe just don't look at the market for the next week"
"17708250","17716150"," or two If you're a bull for a longer time frame I would expect the sideways trade Uh to develop"
"17716150","17724130"," over the next five to eight trading sessions um if you are Uh, if you wanting to trade those they"
"17724130","17727330"," would be You know the same thing the same thing as we did over here."
"17727330","17732090"," It's gonna be something similar to this A smaller leg up."
"17732190","17736910"," I wouldn't expect this big blast off this big banner trader be lower And then something like this"
"17736910","17744370"," then we head lower just something similar Uh, if we don't get the banner trade And we don't get the"
"17744370","17754430"," sideways and down trade uh, that is Uh, the time to throw on some real heavy um But"
"17754430","17759450"," if you if you're a big bear out there and you think we're getting that market break like right now"
"17759940","17766090"," And I I just agree with this with this context, but I promise you if if so, we're right here. "
"17766090","17773750"," This is exactly where we are So if we do not get A vanna trade up into the 617 opex,"
"17774490","17783430"," right that fails And we just start doing this kind of nonsense after 617 fucking This market will"
"17783430","17790840"," crash To the depths of hell You will see 320 by uh, july 1st."
"17791000","17797500"," So if you want that tail risk trade Uh, you wouldn't see the vanna trade coming into the 17th 18th"
"17797500","17804800"," 23rd 21st Uh, but if you do see this trap, this would be expected trade Uh into july and then"
"17804800","17809680"," we'll then we'll make some pretty big fucking nasty moves down Does that I don't know if this helps"
"17809680","17810460"," you guys out there."
"17810560","17814800"," This is a pretty common setup right here A pretty pretty fair we traded this all up. "
"17814800","17816200"," We knew this was also in anything."
"17816240","17824920"," So what's in the scp would meet the testerly soft edge Uh, so a larger time frame If you're"
"17824920","17830400"," thinking about a larger time frame if you're a bull if you're a bear Um My my point to you"
"17830400","17836680"," would be day trade it back and forth Uh, do not get unless if if you're like I want to"
"17836680","17843360"," buy fucking puts the depths of hell I would then say put on some ratio spreads or something that's"
"17843360","17848000"," going to at least pay if it doesn't go to the depths of hell Or I would say day trade"
"17848000","17854760"," it and wait for a rejection at 390 Possibly four Yeah, 390."
"17854960","17859460"," I would start with put spreads and then get more aggressive as you get closer to 400 if we go"
"17859460","17865300"," there Uh with puts maybe make them weeklies or even zero day puts at that point If the market"
"17865300","17872520"," starts to roll over then you get aggressive with zero day puts or five day puts a weeklies Softly"
"17872520","17878800"," now could apply much on a much bigger chance now will depend on factors outside of their control So"
"17878800","17880120"," it's it's a three eight. "
"17880200","17883880"," It's so it's three 18 in the afternoon I'm going to sign off at 330 with you."
"17884060","17887400"," I'm going to give you I'm going to take some of the stuff away real quick I'm going to show"

"19980500","19986360"," right now the trade is lower trade is down here The trade is right here. "
"19986360","19997190"," I'm a paint a box for you That's the trade into tomorrow if you're a bull See"
"19997190","20005640"," that right there On your own charts at home put a little box down here You can actually move this"
"20005640","20012660"," up to 373 45 all the way down to 370 somewhere in here is your next trade Okay, if you're"
"20012660","20018200"," a bull If you missed the trade and we bounced here at 378 it's nothing lost you didn't lose any"
"20018200","20024440"," money More than likely between now and tomorrow you're gonna see that you'll see this at some point"
"20024440","20032060"," tomorrow And when you see this you want this to hold if this holds, uh, it's gonna be a good"
"20032060","20041910"," trade higher It's a good good 263 if you stuck around to the end Okay,"
"20042530","20046730"," so it's good that you stuck around to the end of this broadcast so right in here is what you're"
"20046730","20052030"," looking for For a dip buy That's what i'm looking for and i'm watching the vix right now I want"
"20052030","20058450"," to see that vix get up a little bit more that vix fucking bounced off 27 or 27 76 and"
"20060070","20066210"," For me to buy a dip i want to see it up at like fucking 30 31 Like with fear"
"20066210","20073790"," conf right confidence Somewhere up there like 30 maybe lower How about 30 dollars if I can see the"
"20073790","20081910"," vix at 30 I Buy that i'm talking about that i'd buy calls Just keep that keep an eye on"
"20081910","20087210"," this as we head on the close you might get that vantage rate into tomorrow For or the de-risking"
"20088090","20092270"," But i don't know if it holds into the open My fear is that we get like the we have"
"20092270","20097550"," like a green futures and then we fucking sell before the open If you're a glowback trade it is"
"20097550","20103570"," probably a trade here into the overnight long believe it or not Now cut that shit loose by six or"
"20103570","20110590"," four between four a.m. And six a.m I would cut it out cut it short by a fucking"
"20110590","20117250"," by open pure bull It's a tough place to be buying right here without a glowback sedge You could buy"
"20117250","20121790"," it here and then hedge glowbacks That's the best way to trade if you were to trade this it would"
"20121790","20129830"," be long calls into the close And then if it rolls in the middle of the night Uh you you"
"20129830","20140660"," fucking short the fuck out of uh es many Turicupia losses Yeah,"
"20144670","20151850"," let's look at the market breadth indicator Um Yeah, market breadth should come back you'll see"
"20151850","20157490"," breadth you're gonna see so i want you to know you're gonna see breadth into Into july i promise"
"20157490","20167370"," you you'll see some breadth into july You'll see some breadth Into july We're not going down"
"20167370","20175430"," or we might we might go down to 360 or 380 Uh 360 is probably the put wall bottom right"
"20175430","20175650"," now."
"20175670","20183330"," I haven't looked them dare to i'm assuming the put wall bottom 360 and then Uh 320 on the table"
"20183990","20188350"," Do you guys you really need a lot of shit to happen for this to happen like for like 320"
"20188950","20196610"," So you'll probably see the breadth come into play sideways trade from now into um So let's say from"
"20196610","20202870"," now into july 15th I would say from from a trading range from now an implied move from now to"
"20202870","20210550"," july 15th would be 360 Uh to let's say 420 on the high end Believe it or not do I"
"20210550","20214970"," think you get to 420 probably fucking not Do I think you get 360 probably not to the end of"
"20214970","20222410"," july um Do I think you get 320 in a july very possible uh, so because we're in this downward"
"20222410","20230990"," trend so I think your max is 400 trade sideways trade it fucking sideways into Uh july and then we"
"20230990","20236730"," start rolling it down into 360 and then down into 320s Uh if we start really fucking selling heavy."
"20237310","20243410"," I just don't think you see It's hard to see 50 drop-offs in like a week Like you guys"
"20243410","20249330"," have to understand how massive that is Uh to see a 50 decline in fucking in fucking like two weeks"
"20251150","20258330"," It's happened You need something really bad like I don't know when I want to repeat those bad kind"
"20258330","20264870"," of things but Uh, you're probably not gonna see it Uh You're probably not gonna see that 320 more"
"20264870","20272230"," than likely until late july august maybe Uh, you'll see declines of you know 11% 17% the stuff"
"20272230","20279910"," like that Uh, you'll see trades higher And they'll they'll take this slow down as slowly as long as"
"20279910","20285850"," they possibly fucking can until it actually breaks Uh, so I don't think it breaks until well. "
"20286130","20288230"," I don't think it breaks Let's look at a year chart."
