"248790","251090"," So good morning to you all out there. "
"252550","253430"," Just a second here."
"253530","254810"," We're lining this up here for you."
"255950","257209"," Sure got that right. "
"258610","260910"," A little bit higher so you can see the time there."
"263150","269090"," So, let's go and bring this over here."
"270030","270650"," A couple things. "
"273010","275030"," Look at that."
"275150","278190"," You got some supply above this morning."
"283560","284880"," Into yesterday's belt. "
"285180","287960"," This week, I've highlighted a few things for you."
"289400","290400"," Building a narrative."
"293220","296260"," Number one, we come in these OPEXs. "
"297320","300760"," Dealers, banks, institutions love big-ground numbers, right?"
"302160","304620"," Number two, they love big-ground numbers."
"306900","314780"," You also saw, you also, you also see Max Efery, right, in the morning or on these dates, right?"
"315000","319120"," You saw it yesterday at 6 p.m. Just after 6 p.m., right?"
"319300","323260"," You've got spread holders."
"325120","327540"," They're like, I don't want to see that 420 here, right?"
"327700","328480"," And into this close. "
"328940","330540"," And they did it after 6 p.m., right?"
"331220","332440"," 605, I think they did it."
"332640","333300"," Boom, popped it up."
"334560","338640"," And actually yesterday in that close, when I wasn't done, I was here, but I was typing away and"
"338640","338840"," stuff. "
"339420","341940"," I was trying to buy some options."
"341940","347900"," I was hoping to catch this before 6 p.m., this nice round number."
"350820","355700"," And they, I thought they might do it between four and four 15, so I bought zero dates for like"
"355700","357700"," five cents and four cents and three cents. "
"358960","363700"," And I bought some way out OTM calls for this open this morning."
"365360","369740"," I'm hoping that I can take the money and run here."
"372160","375540"," And be flat on this opening bell this morning next 10 minutes. "
"375640","378660"," I want to take the money and run as soon as the market opens."
"379260","384200"," I have a kind of a weird thesis."
"384480","386860"," I don't know if you, the kind of a weird thesis. "
"387260","396960"," So, I think first and foremost, the target of 420 or 2D 430, 4,300"
"396960","397680"," is valid."
"399420","403440"," I've been stating that for, I was going back yesterday."
"403600","406800"," I'm like, I got tweets of Italian talking to people about going to 440 and 460. "
"407860","412020"," I'm like, wait until I, wait until I, wait until I retweet those people."
"416080","421380"," Now with that said, do I think we tag exactly 4,300?"
"421940","422220"," Fuck no."
"422900","429480"," It would be like 42750 or 42813, I think was another number we had. "
"432970","438650"," I also think that when we get towards that number, now unless something changes, we break down"
"438650","442310"," through hourly daily trend or something, weekly trend."
"444530","446750"," Sure, that validates that statement."
"447950","448650"," I'm getting for that. "
"450030","451050"," I'm actually impressed."
"451050","457290"," I'm not going to name the company, but there's a company that used to give both sides of a trade."
"457570","459610"," They would never take a position publicly. "
"460010","462690"," They'd always say, if this can happen or that can happen."
"463970","466990"," Past six months of the year, they've been actually taking a bias."
"468710","476090"," And you'd find out like a day later, if the bias or if their non-bias was invalidated. "
"476450","477770"," Now they've taken a bias."
"477770","483950"," And if things change, they actually go in public on fin to it and say, yeah, our thesis is"
"483950","484490"," invalidated."
"484570","484910"," I like that. "
"485030","485450"," I agree with that."
"485590","486930"," I think it's a great way to do business."
"490210","491970"," Now that 430, right?"
"492670","493910"," It's probably not there. "
"494150","495690"," They're going to sell out before you."
"495770","497150"," We got that's going to get front run sold."
"498170","499650"," So I'm on that trade, right?"
"501330","509490"," I also just on this open, find it fascinating that even with that thesis that we're going up there. "
"511929","513750"," That today is a perfect day."
"515230","516289"," Emotions are high."
"516690","517289"," People are angry. "
"519309","522070"," I know that you're being told that nobody was short."
"522470","522909"," That's a lie."
"526010","526850"," They were short. "
"527970","528850"," Retail was short."
"530630","532430"," They were drinking that fucking Kool-Aid."
"532890","535430"," You can go back into my Tuesday clothes video. "
"537250","543630"," At 3.50 pm, I calmly asked all of you, are you taking the money and running?"
"545130","547610"," Are you closing your shorts and closing your puts?"
"548870","550550"," Is anyone buying calls with me here?"
"552450","556350"," And the chat was out of control, bearish."
"561960","569260"," Pure pandemonium in my chat."
"572080","581740"," And we relentlessly went up from that point forward to where we are right now. "
"583220","593800"," So for me personally, I feel like, think like there's probably going to be if"
"593800","597820"," I was trying to exit this morning, I would be exiting into you if you're a bull."
"602180","606240"," We're going to go up to 4.27, but I don't know that it's today."
"606400","612980"," Maybe today, but for me, my yellow sirens are going off. "
"613220","614120"," You know what you can do here?"
"615420","618820"," You exit into on a Friday, you exit into all these bulls that want to fomo."
"620780","624380"," You already know that the bears are going to jump on with a shit ton of puts right on this"
"624380","624980"," open guaranteed."
"626200","629480"," You know, hedge funds are going to come in and want to hedge this event with J-POW. "
"632260","637560"," And you can just pin it sideways and down slowly, just grind sideways and down."
"638680","644520"," And then we get the rip in two, three, four, five days, tag our 4.27. We're good to go."
"645380","646080"," Then you get to roll. "
"649400","651200"," And we have to talk about that too."
"651880","653540"," We have to talk about a couple of things on this subject."
"653860","656820"," Number one, how far do we roll?"
"658060","659400"," We're going to discuss that today. "
"659980","661480"," When we do roll, how far is it?"
"662180","665080"," There we talked to you last week about the stabilization of markets."
"665700","667820"," How you're seeing the stabilization of markets."
"668060","669480"," I showed you those lines. "
"669660","671220"," I was like, you see that orange line?"
"671360","672280"," You see that yellow line?"
"672860","673620"," You see that green line?"
"674400","677440"," They're spreading out and stabilizing markets."
"678040","682080"," The VIX is telling you forward looking to expect less volatility."
"683340","684680"," We'll re-review that again today. "
"685500","690120"," And then the last point I'm going to say to you is, sometimes I say to you, I can usually"
"690120","694300"," tell you the price of the stock market with how the news is interpreted."
"697680","705300"," So if all of a sudden something gets solved, and we're at 4.27, where all of a sudden something"
"705300","706480"," doesn't get solved."
"706940","709900"," But we're at 4.27. Good news is good news. "
"710240","711660"," Good news is bad news, right?"
"714700","716160"," Price here is going to matter."
"732830","738850"," I also posted on Fintuit this morning about, so I'm going to set this up."
"742170","743870"," Three minutes until the opening bell. "
"745130","747170"," About not trading today."
"748010","750950"," It's a key important thing to understand."
"751810","757610"," There are so many better days to trade. "
"758210","764570"," If you're on high emotions this morning, if you're, I missed the rally person."
"766330","770310"," If you're, I just lost $100,000 person."
"772550","773670"," Today is not for you. "
"775570","776870"," I've been on these days."
"777090","777570"," I've been here."
"777690","779510"," Like I've been here where I've lost money. "
"782210","784630"," And I'm like, I'm going right back in right now."
"784810","786150"," I can, I do today, I can do that."
"786650","788010"," And I'm pretty good at it. "
"789170","793490"," But there is a long time as a trader where I was not good at it."
"794610","797810"," And it was when my emotions were running very high."
"801720","810400"," And so I want you to know that this is a prime candidate day for your emotions to get the"
"810400","811280"," best of you today. "
"815500","821680"," The best setups are like, not quiet markets, but like, you know, like normal vol, normal events."
"824060","828120"," You know what to expect mostly in a day when you're trading."
"828640","836580"," Today, days like today, like to me, it's like amateur hour today, monthly opex, massive run. "
"837360","839480"," Most of retail thought we were going to collapse."
"841900","845680"," You know, there's deleted tweets all over Fentuit."
"846880","855460"," There's deleted tweets in our comments in my YouTube videos, deleted comment sections, all"
"855460","857220"," littering Fentuit this morning. "
"857220","858760"," I began yesterday."
"859320","860480"," You were going through and cleaning up."
"860560","862540"," I delete tweets, but most of it have been out drinking all night long. "
"863160","865200"," I don't delete the ones where I make a bad call."
"868640","870200"," It was litter my Twitter."
"874140","877140"," 49 seconds left until the open. "

"896020","899760"," Bloodbath down at 410.69, baby."
"903300","908560"," I mean, think about this."
"908720","913480"," If you got torch this week, there's always another trade to short. "
"914760","914760"," Always."
"924910","925790"," I'll take that."
"929410","931230"," It took six cents. "
"931490","932010"," I'm happy, man."
"935540","936180"," I'm good."
"936340","936920"," I am now flat. "
"939140","939620"," Flatter."
"941080","942300"," I shouldn't say that."
"942460","944160"," I say flatter than a witch is something. "
"944900","951900"," I don't know if you guys know that term, but great morning to let the market breathe."
"956130","960010"," Price trading below the five-minute trigger."
"963260","967120"," Five-minute EMA price currently below on the opening bell this morning. "
"979220","981480"," I'm going to check some of these H lines here."

"1005760","1007740"," But dude, there's a bunch of gaps above too. "
"1008120","1009460"," You think there's gaps down here?"
"1009640","1010800"," You should see the gaps on high."

"1391680","1394340"," Our poll making is pretty good, right?"
"1394340","1397880"," Our last poll was we go down to 400."
"1398500","1400980"," We go to 404, we go to 410. "
"1402020","1407360"," Once again, our traders are some badasses."
"1407700","1408340"," They were like 410."
"1409740","1412640"," BAM nailed it off and running. "
"1420040","1421440"," Maybe we run a poll."
"1422700","1423760"," We could do it either way."
"1423760","1427620"," We could do it today. "
"1428660","1432200"," Do we scream higher to that 427?"
"1433020","1434700"," Do we trade sideways and down?"
"1436060","1437580"," Or is this the start of the crash?"

"1575820","1578760"," If nobody shows up, they're just going to warehouse this shit."
"1579780","1580960"," They're not going to let it crash."

"1598590","1601250"," Winky is still on fire about footlocker."
"1612360","1615020"," Call out the vote choices and it'll do it, but I'll do it, dad."
"1617180","1617880"," I'm ready. "
"1617880","1626860"," Uh, four twenty six is one option"
"1626860","1629460"," today, four twenty six today."
"1630720","1634720"," Second option is sideways and down to consolidate."
"1635020","1636160"," You can just write sideways down. "
"1638680","1645140"," Last one would be, we'll just call it like an intraday market crash would be the third one because"
"1645140","1646780"," I know bears want this."
"1658390","1665470"," And a key point here too is stay focused on price action, right?"
"1667170","1671450"," Remember all of your tools, remember all of your training, everything we do here."
"1672150","1676510"," If you are going to trade today, if we're going down, price needs to be below the five minute,"
"1676650","1676770"," right?"
"1677770","1681770"," We're going up as long as price stays above and confirms above the white line, right?"
"1682310","1683410"," It's like right now, let's look at this. "
"1683590","1684830"," So we're squeezing up right now, right?"
"1686710","1692790"," Always remember that you usually get prices above, we get back down here and confirm the trade is"
"1692790","1696350"," higher on the yellow line, right?"
"1696570","1698190"," That's where you enter the trade here, right?"
"1701640","1703580"," Same goes for the downside, right?"
"1703760","1709020"," If if price gets underneath this white line, you want to not just go below it, but confirm that the"
"1709020","1710960"," leg is lower, enter the trade here."
"1714020","1723980"," So enter all of this emotional baggage that you're carrying, whether you're a bull or a bear,"
"1724660","1728820"," make sure you stick to your rules, especially in a day like today, stick to your rules."
"1735720","1743720"," This is when your rules will serve you well on high emotional days. "
"1750780","1753780"," High emotion days, stick to your rules."
"1833040","1840100"," This, if you want to follow this on at home, set up a set up a five minute chart on"
"1840100","1841800"," your favorites charting software."
"1843260","1848740"," Slap on a 27 EMA and today it's at a one 29 EMA. "
"1851480","1854200"," That little yellow line, this is a six EMA."
"1856460","1862100"," I leave this on because if I switch to a five minute chart, this is so this yellow line is"
"1862100","1867680"," better represented on a as the white line on a one minute chart."
"1867960","1872260"," I don't know if that explains, but if you don't know what I'm talking about, shouldn't be trading,"
"1872700","1876000"," just watch and just watch us hang out for the day. "
"1886010","1892750"," I'm not exactly trading EMA's, but I can represent EMA's for you at home by the tool that I use"
"1892750","1893210"," in the background."
"1893290","1896730"," It's an easier way for me to, for you guys to follow along."
"1899530","1901130"," After that, I adjust them all the time. "
"1901270","1908490"," I adjust the 20, I think I had the 27 on 20 yesterday, and I had the one 29 at"
"1908490","1909970"," like one 16 or something like that."
"1913050","1914390"," So I switch them up every day."
"1916210","1918710"," As I can't get an EMA to do what I want it to do. "
"1932440","1934540"," So as this done, we wanted it to do yet?"
"1934700","1935220"," No, right?"
"1937940","1940300"," Want to see price go above?"
"1943160","1945160"," Confirm and come up, right?"
"1945340","1946200"," That's your trade, right?"
"1947560","1949180"," That hasn't happened yet, has it?"
"1950140","1951280"," No trade here, is there?"
"2068820","2071800"," My take on today, you want to know what my answer is to the poll?"
"2073159","2075780"," My answer in that poll is sideways and down."
"2080179","2087000"," Though even though that's what I think is going to happen, if we do go above, I'll take that trade."
"2090520","2092440"," It doesn't go the way that I think it's going to go. "
"2092440","2094320"," I have no problems trading it down or up."
"2106180","2111480"," Although I will say this, that three day trade, that three green bar trade, I did expect us to gap"
"2111480","2116780"," even higher into the open today, and then for that to happen."
"2116780","2117700"," That did not happen. "
"2124590","2129150"," I like those like three bars like you gap up the day three."
"2129990","2132870"," You trap all these bulls in, you sell it off all day long."
"2133070","2133710"," We didn't get that today. "
"2134550","2137790"," We got a little bit of a gap, but not, you know, the one that we would normally get."
"2144080","2145800"," So I see today as consolidation."
"2147240","2155380"," Then you get a bunch of emotional trainers just like, we're going to fucking crash this thing, or"
"2155380","2157500"," we're going to rip it to the moon today. "
"2158760","2162860"," They take all your money, that's what I think happens."
"2165040","2166600"," And they tie you in."
"2173670","2180930"," I think this Bernanke and Jay Pothing is going to be a low like, you know, like you're going to"
"2180930","2184170"," get some vol out of it, but I don't think it's going to be what people think it is personally. "
"2184610","2190090"," If they do, if you, in my other point, I didn't say this, I should have said this, but if"
"2190090","2193150"," your thesis is, it's going to be like market doom."
"2195470","2198630"," You want to waste like nine cents or seven cents on that trade."
"2198710","2199110"," I get it. "
"2200070","2205530"," Full account, fuck no, you should be like, yeah, it's a 0.1% of my account or 1%"
"2205530","2206190"," of my account."
"2207530","2211210"," And they're way OTM, something like that."
"2211730","2212850"," I'm hedging myself today. "
"2213070","2214610"," I don't care if this burns to zero."
"2215790","2219850"," I don't have to go back to work on Friday if this trade doesn't work itself out to full on"
"2219850","2220150"," Lotto."
"2220990","2222370"," I accept that risk as a Lotto. "
"2223310","2224790"," Then I'd be like, yeah, it sounds cool."
"2225090","2226230"," That sounds rational to me."
"2229110","2235110"," But like anyone with a thesis today, I'm like, there's probably a high probability that that thesis"
"2235110","2236730"," is going to get burned to the ground today. "
"2237390","2238950"," So many easier days to trade."
"2263440","2264920"," So I think what do we do for the poll?"
"2265640","2271960"," So for the poll, you type in, I vote or not, excuse me, exclamation point, vote."
"2282490","2288270"," Yeah, so after the last two days, I'm like, dude, that day three, they just usually fucking face"
"2288270","2288530"," ripping. "
"2288830","2290450"," It's usually like boom, boom, boom, boom."
"2292990","2294490"," That's a good traditional thing, right?"
"2294930","2296350"," You guys know what a three-bar trade is?"
"2296430","2297610"," You can look it up, three-bar trade."
"2303280","2303960"," Classic setup. "
"2308770","2309370"," Good morning."
"2309370","2310150"," It's the holy croissant."
"2310270","2310570"," How are you?"
"2319120","2322400"," MBOY might be about to have a pop should know in like 15 minutes. "
"2326910","2328170"," Oh, sorry, Winky."
"2328450","2329630"," That's a, I misspoke."
"2329630","2330810"," I miss, let's put it out. "
"2330930","2335930"," Let's put the poll out now, and then end it at 10.30 before we get to J-POW so"
"2335930","2341410"," that people have their, we have some kind of an idea of what, I think our traders are very smart."
"2344050","2345910"," Our polls, I think, kick ass."
"2346850","2349090"," Like, I used to think it was like 70% win rate. "
"2349310","2353250"," Our polls right now are like, 89% of the time they nail it."
"2357880","2359360"," All right, let's take a look right now."
"2362220","2364560"," We're going to take like an MBLY right now. "
"2364880","2368880"," Ticker symbol, Mike, Bravo, Lima, Yankie."
"2370960","2373880"," Spoons squeezing up into supply."
"2375500","2377200"," Can we get a face ripper here?"
"2377560","2380660"," Can we break above and start ripping some faces off?"
"2382000","2383100"," Squeeze the shorts. "
"2396440","2397780"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"2398040","2399200"," MBLY is ready."
"2416650","2418630"," MBLY, mobile eye, global. "
"2428060","2433600"," Trading 39.82. Outstanding squeeze here."
"2433760","2434660"," What are we looking for here?"
"2434800","2435840"," We're looking for a kiss trade."
"2438280","2442920"," We're looking for MBLY to go above as it's done and it's daily trigger. "
"2444140","2449780"," Come back down from the moon and confirm another move higher here."
"2450660","2452400"," Closing the gap above."
"2453880","2461400"," At 40.60. So if it can squeeze up here, hit 40.60. Come back down to the daily and"
"2461400","2463380"," have the hourly trigger come up. "
"2463800","2468380"," You're going to get a five trigger cluster to the upside and really start mooning."
"2469240","2473400"," Trade is dead below 39.60 on MBLY."
"2474180","2475740"," Second price target above. "
"2476660","2479420"," 42.61 on mobile eye."
"2489560","2490600"," Duo lingo."
"2492420","2494640"," It's not, so we don't have the stock show up and run yet. "
"2494720","2497380"," So I'm going to give you guys some targets for these tickers on this ETF."
"2498460","2509770"," Duo lingo, 147.54. 138.18. Nari,"
"2510070","2511050"," N-A-R-I."
"2511630","2513190"," On a buy right now. "
"2516150","2519510"," 68.45. It needs to get above that number though."
"2519630","2521210"," This is a jump in this trade."
"2521430","2522330"," Get out of this trade. "
"2522590","2525790"," You want to see Nari trade up here."
"2526610","2527690"," Take the money and run."
"2528250","2530270"," If it gets above, it's hourly trigger. "
"2530970","2534950"," Boom, next target above $73 on Nari."
"2535750","2538690"," Looks like buyers stepping in this morning on that ticker."
"2541010","2543950"," Dash rolling down to its hourly trigger. "
"2544170","2553930"," 66.35. 63.76. And most specifically, this is my favorite one, the emotional"
"2553930","2561790"," level, $60.97. Toast coming off a Monster Rally and run."
"2563290","2569910"," 20.53 and the one that I really like is $18.99 on toast."
"2571910","2573470"," Oscar Monster run. "
"2575390","2582990"," 7.26 as it's hourly, but more specifically, I love that $6.68. So you can see it right down"

"2583310","2585510"," Stepped right in, ripped it."

"2794710","2796910"," It is 10 in the morning."
"2797550","2803330"," Binky, if you want to come back and snip that out, I want to make an announcement this morning."
"2804710","2808050"," It's 10 a.m. Binky, if you can snip that out, right?"
"2808910","2814090"," And release that video just to our members on YouTube. "
"2814890","2822650"," If you're a subscriber on Twitch, I don't know how to get this video to you."
"2822650","2827530"," If you're a subscriber, so on YouTube, I can do private member-only videos."
"2828230","2831210"," I don't know if I can do a subscriber-only video on Twitch. "
"2831850","2838270"," If that's possible, we need to find a way to get these videos to Twitch subscribers."
"2839810","2842350"," Like subscriber-only content for Twitch."
"2843270","2848990"," Or maybe we post that to a website and give access to just Twitch subscribers. "
"2849870","2855990"," Because Binky has been releasing videos for members only on YouTube."
"2862540","2866080"," Otherwise, if you're not a subscriber, you're not a follower or something like that, whatever that"
"2866080","2870800"," stuff is, you'll have to come back and find this in today's video, pause it, and all that kind of"
"2870800","2871020"," stuff."
"2874330","2876770"," So that's an update for you heading into Saturday. "
"2879110","2883990"," Yeah, Binky's been clipping them and releasing them for members only on YouTube."
"2884630","2888030"," So maybe if Binky, if we can remember for that, I think we're having a meeting this weekend."
"2888910","2893890"," If you remember to find a way to do a clip for subscribers on Twitch. "
"2896390","2898610"," So they'll always have references for this stuff."
"2903920","2904720"," Ben Bernakey!"
"2906700","2907420"," Thanks, Binky."
"2907560","2908160"," I appreciate it, brother. "
"2910480","2911640"," Thanks, Pearlville, Tom."
"2916550","2921250"," Yeah, I think we're getting- we have a poll right now or no."
"2927960","2930740"," You're almost done with education of a speculator. "
"2931340","2932040"," Not dang it."
"2934200","2935140"," You guys are good."
"2936380","2939860"," You guys are all getting trapped up in this shit over here and I bet you are. "
"2942720","2946440"," I bet you're not all of you, but I know some of you are."
"2948640","2949620"," It's a trap."
"2953940","2955940"," The hedge is on, baby. "
"2956660","2959160"," Boom, hedge, boom, hedge."
"2966610","2967970"," Now the poll is running."
"2968890","2975170"," So if you are out there, just type in an exclamation point, vote. "
"2983080","2989040"," What you do is the- so the poll is going- follow me a second."
"2994060","2995160"," So I got this right here."
"2997500","2999840"," So here's the- here's how you vote right here. "
"3000020","3003720"," Poll is going for on 5, 5, 19."
"3004060","3007300"," We do we- you do so I'll do it right now, okay?"
"3009120","3010440"," See if I got this right or not."
"3012720","3014500"," Uh, I'm doing this one. "
"3015420","3016040"," I vote."
"3017180","3018980"," I don't know if they got this wrong or not."
"3019520","3019960"," Sideways. "
"3021900","3022500"," In it."
"3029560","3030000"," Sideways."
"3032300","3033780"," So that's how I did it right there. "
"3034020","3035500"," I vote and then I wrote sideways."
"3041400","3042080"," There you go."
"3042180","3043120"," I got- I did it right. "
"3043120","3050640"," So you click like you do- you do the exclamation point, V-O-T-E, space bar, and you"
"3050640","3051320"," have three choices."
"3051560","3054500"," You write sideways, crash, or higher."
"3055260","3056120"," That's a good way to do it, Winky. "
"3075080","3076180"," Yeah, first thing."
"3077120","3077960"," Audanes, man."
"3078380","3080700"," He's like- he's like, I'm coming in here to do this. "
"3084380","3091560"," If you are just joining us, if you haven't been around the past few days, we're trying- we're"
"3091560","3095520"," growing and our chat is becoming overrun with a counter alpha."
"3097320","3106880"," So we're trying- we're trying right now is to try to get"
"3106880","3115000"," people to not give us so much counter alpha, like just like spamming the chats."
"3116040","3124000"," So the idea here is if you want to chat with us and stream, there's an option for you on"
"3124000","3125340"," YouTube to become a member. "
"3125880","3126660"," It's five bucks."
"3127920","3128620"," It's nothing."
"3128980","3130540"," It's like a beer and a month. "
"3131280","3132760"," It's a coffee in a month."
"3133960","3136480"," You can do the same thing on Twitch."
"3137880","3139700"," If you're like, I'm never paying anybody. "
"3140480","3141180"," That's fine."
"3141740","3143200"," There's option number three."
"3143740","3151300"," You can go to Prime Gaming on Amazon Prime and subscribe to me through Twitch there. "
"3152720","3160960"," You take five dollars from- you take five dollars from Jeff Bezos."
"3162020","3163520"," You don't pay anything."
"3164960","3168140"," And you can subscribe via Twitch and then you can chat. "
"3168780","3170020"," So it's just an extra step."
"3170520","3173020"," Try to keep spammers out of the chat."
"3174260","3179100"," I also want you to know that I don't really get any of that money. "
"3179560","3182780"," Like none of that five dollars really goes to me."
"3184780","3186820"," YouTube for five dollars, right?"
"3187100","3188560"," YouTube takes half of it."
"3189820","3192560"," And if you guys are running into a screenshot, I'll show you right now. "
"3193240","3194900"," They take- they take a five dollars."
"3195080","3195600"," They take half."
"3196940","3199280"," The two dollars and fifty cents left over. "
"3199560","3204980"," I pay 30% on that and I pay the processing fee to get it to me."
"3205740","3209200"," So I probably get maybe a dollar and change."
"3210160","3214760"," And then I have somebody that I have hired to do my books. "
"3215620","3217480"," That person cost me money, believe it or not."
"3219220","3222960"," So this isn't like a money grab if anyone ever thinks that."
"3223160","3225140"," I've been streaming air free for many years. "
"3226740","3231900"," If you think that there's like I'm doing this to like make five bucks off everybody, I don't see"
"3231900","3233020"," shit out of that money."
"3233300","3237280"," Like I see like a dollar and change maybe once a month."
"3238360","3243160"," So you know, this isn't- I didn't institute this to try to make money. "
"3243300","3243860"," I have no sponsors."
"3244740","3248740"," I've got- I don't push any products to you guys unless I've never- I've always been like, hey,"
"3249140","3250300"," this is what I'm doing here, right?"
"3251620","3255940"," So if there's any like thought at any point that this is what did you think that it is?"
"3256020","3256320"," It's not."
"3256960","3258220"," It's just to clean up the chat. "
"3258920","3260720"," Make sure that people are here for the right reasons."
"3262340","3265560"," Make sure that people are not posting counter alpha."
"3268100","3273380"," And so that we can trade the day away so we don't lose our asses in this market. "
"3276820","3277720"," Joe Donut, man."
"3278240","3278440"," Agreed."
"3280920","3284760"," Yeah, I was looking at the- I was looking at what I what I make last night on that"
"3284760","3286820"," and I'm like, they- these- I was like, they took it all. "
"3286960","3288020"," I was like these fucking guys."
"3288240","3291460"," I'm like, it's like, they all get their hands out."
"3292200","3294400"," YouTube's like, thank you very much for the memberships. "
"3295100","3296780"," I'm like, fuck you, YouTube."
"3309200","3310440"," Grinding right now."

"3341240","3343620"," Fed Chair Powell. "
"3344560","3348360"," He participates in perspectives on monetary policy."
"3349540","3350380"," Conversation."
"3353660","3356040"," I've got it up right now in the background. "
"3358780","3362760"," Um, I don't know if there's prepared remarks or not."
"3364000","3370980"," Uh, if there is the new squawk should release them so we can get access to them as the conversation"
"3370980","3371800"," begins."
"3374020","3377760"," As you can see, the market has not moved. "
"3382610","3384630"," No movement in the market."
"3396830","3398490"," Give me just one second here."
"3434990","3435990"," Back again. "
"3440850","3443690"," Uh, Devin making a great point this morning."

"3447910","3449230"," Jay Powell has you by the balls. "
"3450170","3456410"," Uh, Devin's saying if Powell has been constant about anything, it's that he generally avoids"
"3456410","3460330"," upsetting comments outside of planned meetings."
"3466960","3471900"," Viva Vavatar is continuing the gift sub they got from Winkyface right on."
"3476260","3481580"," Cosmo not project has re subscribed for prime for three months in a row. "

"3558120","3565340"," And there's a large contingency of traders out there that find value from this show. "
"3565960","3570080"," Yesterday, when we had traders saying, you know, I don't even trade the spot, but I would just want"
"3570080","3571740"," to have a companion piece next to me."

"3607920","3613380"," Not like a lot of live streamers are like two bros sucking each other off."
"3613380","3616380"," Like two frat bros sucking each other off."
"3616580","3621940"," Or it's two guys that are talking in high concepts with no convictions. "

"5937560","5944880"," He doesn't bear too often away from the standard response."
"5945260","5952240"," I guess there would be some expectation that bear nanky will try to come out and say something"
"5952240","5952960"," horrible right?"
"5953260","5957580"," Like is the market about to crash some stupid like that?"
"5959560","5967480"," You're not going to expect a fed chair how to disclose policy at a group think tank or a I"
"5967480","5970880"," think my view is that this is a way to just suck off for nanky."
"5971180","5972540"," Give him a bunch of awards. "
"5974820","5980660"," That's my guess is that he'll have like the Medal of Freedom award or something presented to him."
"5980900","5983580"," It's like rich people in power for people sucking each other off."
"5983700","5985040"," That's basically what I think this is. "
"5986800","5989460"," Now right here this trade right here to the downside."
"5990340","5994360"," If there's a hedge on the market which so likely is because Jay Powell still is speaking."
"5995360","6001240"," These hedge funds will pull up a tricky right and you will have a quick blast down come big red"
"6001240","6003020"," bars and then they're out of the market. "
"6007090","6008630"," Market's free to do what it wants to do."
"6009790","6016070"," Final boss day for the bears though bears want that that hammer blow to the stock market."
"6020350","6024010"," Supply to the upside we keep tagging it, tagging it, tagging it. "
"6024850","6026250"," We keep slamming into that thing."
"6026390","6027710"," We're going to rip at some point."
"6027850","6029250"," We're going to have a nice squeeze on our hands. "
"6032640","6034460"," Nice little straddle here."
"6036780","6038280"," We'll see which way we go."
"6038440","6041660"," I guess either way I'm hoping for like a 50 cent. "
"6041840","6045160"," I'm hoping for a 50 cent print on either side."
"6045760","6047860"," Then catch them both sides will be even happier."
"6060830","6062610"," Yeah, hand jobs all around exactly. "
"6062930","6064510"," That's what I think that this meeting is."
"6064630","6067150"," That's meeting but I think it's hand jobs all around."
"6072000","6075600"," This is like a similar trade for like a Fed rate decision days. "
"6075600","6078860"," You just go in there and we rip down."
"6079060","6084500"," We rip up close one side, close the other side and you're doing just fine."
"6086960","6088220"," Easy day of trading. "
"6116520","6118920"," Yeah, I think they should have renamed this thing like this."
"6119100","6123220"," I think it's got like they should have renamed it like perspectives on monetary policy."
"6126360","6128220"," We throw darts at the wall. "
"6130620","6131920"," We break shit."
"6132180","6133450"," We overtighten and we undertighten."
"6134600","6135960"," We put too much money in. "
"6136060","6137320"," We take too much money out."
"6140880","6142960"," We're flying blind at all times."
"6144880","6150760"," I can't say this publicly until I retire but I'll have one day I'll write a book and say we"
"6150760","6152340"," have no fucking idea what we're doing. "
"6165180","6170930"," Yeah, I don't think it's contentious."
"6171370","6177630"," It could be it's just like I would expect this more like this like two things I would expect."
"6179410","6186790"," I would expect more like this like a Senate hearing would be very volatile. "
"6190970","6194550"," Like the only volatility that I'm personally expecting from this is."
"6195410","6198510"," Hey, I have a hedge on the markets and I want paid for it."
"6199330","6203850"," So I have a hedge here and I want that I want that quick payments, right?"
"6204270","6206190"," Yahoo, I took my money, do whatever you want to do. "
"6206550","6208690"," It's like a hit and run robbery kind of a thing."
"6210510","6213070"," And then the market comes right back up here."
"6216280","6220860"," Like like a Senate hearing, you'll get like grand political grandstanding. "
"6221800","6231000"," You also have pool reporters that have the ability to ask questions in like a fed fed rate"
"6231000","6231440"," decision."
"6234900","6238060"," In the past years ago, you would get a rate."
"6240460","6242820"," Policy decisions and in Senate hearings. "
"6243700","6247720"," That kind of stuff, but they've been so so transparent recently."
"6248380","6252340"," That you're not going to expect them to do this at like a luncheon somewhere."
"6252700","6254160"," It's like a closed event, right?"
"6254360","6255880"," Like we invite you in as the press. "
"6256760","6260280"," If you start any shit, we're not going to let you back in here ever again, right?"
"6260400","6261680"," So you're not really going to get like."
"6263160","6265100"," It's like it's kind of a staged event."
"6273910","6276670"," Hope the ghost of Darth Volcker doesn't show up. "
"6276810","6277330"," Yeah, dude."
"6278290","6280470"," You know, like it's weird to like Volcker."
"6280670","6284670"," I was like on the Volcker. "
"6284870","6286850"," Volcker trade, man, the market went up, dude."
"6287190","6292510"," Like the crazy part about the Volcker trade is no one wants to admit to is the stock market went"
"6292510","6293530"," up into the right."
"6294250","6299370"," And every time it came back down, it still was not a previous low that we visited. "
"6300350","6301430"," He did a great job."
"6301650","6303810"," I have I have a lot of respect for Volcker."
"6304910","6308070"," Like when this like in the 50s and 60s and then in the 70s. "
"6308630","6311690"," If you look back on all that stuff, like the market was stable."
"6311970","6312730"," The market went up slowly."
"6313990","6316670"," They tightened nice and believe it or not. "
"6316690","6318590"," I know like he had to come back and do it again."
"6319070","6319870"," I'm like, yeah, I know."
"6320010","6320150"," I know. "
"6320370","6323110"," But if you look back on all that history over 10, 20, 30 years."
"6324550","6325250"," Not too bad."
"6325330","6325930"," They did a good job. "
"6325930","6329170"," Honestly, like 1978 is where shit got crazy."
"6331850","6335890"," Big green bar volume bar on Z spy."
"6340460","6342820"," Oh, yeah, there it is right there. "
"6342960","6345180"," Seven million buys here."
"6350560","6353580"," I might have to cut the I don't have to cut that loose right there."
"6355460","6357940"," I'm now just long on calls here. "
"6361650","6363690"," This scared me out of my puts right here."
"6363830","6365950"," This green bar right here is scaring me."
"6373640","6376000"," It's a big old green bar right there. "
"6376240","6378940"," Six point five million."
"6390080","6392100"," Yeah, staged event by the man Bernanke."
"6402720","6407000"," No, like if you go if you go back when you guys look back in time and we can go"
"6407000","6407700"," look at it today. "
"6407700","6414560"," You guys like we're always like focused on a one minute chart or like rates went to 20% and"
"6414560","6415580"," people lost everything."
"6415920","6419940"," I'm like, dude, this market went sideways and up for a long time."
"6424230","6431830"," It's very rare that it's very rare that it happens, but it's very rare that it goes below a"
"6431830","6434890"," previous low, even like 2008, 2000. "
"6436150","6441130"," If we didn't get that second leg down, you should have bought that dip, right?"
"6441290","6442270"," Or not even just buy that dip."
"6442290","6447410"," You still would have been just fine if you had been investing over decades."
"6456060","6457180"," We'll look back on it today. "
"6457220","6458780"," If you want to, we can look back on that stuff."
"6459280","6461000"," I look at that stuff all the time."
"6461000","6465900"," And I'm like, yeah, I'm like, if you look at like, I was on fin to it. "
"6465900","6471960"," And I was like, man, like you look at like a DJ DJ I chart, right?"
"6472540","6476680"," And you look, you put it on a month time frame."
"6476700","6482420"," We just don't see that many red bars going all the way back to the 1800s."
"6483780","6485960"," He just don't see that many red bars. "
"6486240","6487240"," We got one last year."
"6487840","6491640"," Oh, they're very, very rare."
"6492120","6495880"," And even when we get one, the next one is usually green. "
"6496700","6498100"," I usually think every single time."
"6501040","6504060"," Spy trading for 2055 right now."
"6505740","6507420"," Oh shit, I forgot to put this on. "
"6509980","6511020"," Hold on a second here."
"6511240","6511420"," My bad."
"6511940","6513240"," I had the wrong speaker on. "
"6513240","6517520"," And we had a lot of informative discussions."
"6517880","6521000"," So rather than being his teacher, I was really his student in those early years."
"6522240","6528500"," As you know, by the time, as you noted, by the time I became chair in 2018, Tomas was the"
"6528500","6530100"," head of division of monetary affairs. "
"6530440","6534120"," And in that role, he was a trusted advisor to me and to the FOMC."
"6535080","6539440"," His leadership was particularly important as the FOMC conducted our first ever public monetary"
"6539440","6540300"," policy review."
"6540300","6545980"," He played a major role in organizing that, identifying key topics and organizing the staff all"
"6545980","6547200"," through the Federal Reserve System. "
"6547780","6554600"," He also played an absolutely essential role during the critical period of the pandemic at the very"
"6554600","6559800"," beginning when we were marshalling our forces and our tools to stabilize the financial system to"
"6559800","6562080"," protect the economy from even more dire consequences."
"6563060","6567800"," And through it all, he did come through as- We're making some good money right now on the call"
"6567800","6568340"," side here."
"6570220","6576760"," His mastery of monetary economics, but also just for his kindness as a human being, and just as"
"6576760","6580100"," being a terrific great colleague and a great person. "
"6581260","6581960"," Thank you."
"6582200","6585000"," I think there's a lot of agreement for the sentiments that both of you have expressed."
"6585560","6586200"," Appreciate that. "
"6587040","6592860"," Before we get to some questions on some current issues, I want to ask you both about any formative"
"6592860","6597480"," experiences that you may have had that have shaped your views, particularly about your thinking"
"6597480","6598620"," about monetary policy."
"6599440","6601900"," Paul Volker in his oral history- Oh."
"6602460","6608340"," Tells the story of his mother, who was adamant that he received the same dollar value monthly"
"6608340","6612880"," allowance when he was in college, that his older sisters did ten years prior. "
"6613580","6618940"," And of course, he was not too happy about that because inflation in the interim obviously eroded"
"6618940","6620880"," the real purchasing power of that allowance."
"6621760","6626900"," So as the story goes, that was the beginning of his personal commitment to Christ's ability."
"6628680","6631360"," So Jay, do you have any such stories to tell?"
"6631940","6639240"," Maybe not quite that on point, but so I graduated from college in 1975 during what we now call the"
"6639240","6642080"," Great Inflation, and same college year as Ben. "
"6642780","6647640"," And I started working as a lawyer in the financial sector in the late 1970s."
"6647640","6654900"," I recall from that time a growing sense that high inflation was essentially a permanent part of the"
"6654900","6660540"," landscape, just something that we all had to accept and deal with, and that the costs of getting"
"6660540","6661580"," rid of it were too high."
"6662120","6663480"," So you just were getting used to it. "
"6664160","6670400"," Of course, ultimately the Fed did step up and restore price stability, and one lesson from that era"
"6670400","6672540"," is that price stability is really the foundation."
"6672540","6677480"," Fed's house's price stability is the foundation of a strong economy and the responsibility of the"
"6677480","6679120"," central bank to maintain it."
"6679360","6682600"," That high inflation is when we have high inflation. "
"6682860","6686460"," Fed's house's inflation is far above the Fed objective."
"6688100","6693760"," So today, while inflation isn't as high as it was when I was in college, it's nonetheless far above"
"6693760","6699080"," our two percent objective, and many people are currently experiencing high inflation for the first"
"6699080","6699940"," time."
"6699940","6703080"," House says high inflation poses a significant hardship. "
"6703080","6703900"," You really don't like it."
"6704220","6712280"," So we are very aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it reduces purchasing"
"6712280","6719680"," power, especially for those who are at the margins of the economy and living paycheck to paycheck"
"6719680","6724680"," and need to use all of their incoming income to pay for food, housing, and transportation, and"
"6724680","6727300"," other essentials."
"6727300","6732240"," And that's why the committee is so strongly committed to returning to our two percent goal. "
"6733000","6737760"," We think that failure to get inflation down would not only prolong the pain, but also increase"
"6737760","6742440"," ultimately the social costs of getting back to price stability, causing even greater harm to"
"6742440","6743180"," families and businesses."
"6743800","6746740"," And we aim to avoid that by remaining steadfast in pursuit of our goals."
"6747720","6748340"," Thank you. "
"6748560","6751540"," He read that directly from a white paper in front of him."
"6751700","6755520"," Dale Jorgensen and Harvard and Stanley Fisher at MIT in particular, but I'm going to tell you about"
"6755520","6757740"," something that happened to me when I was six years old."
"6758940","6763660"," I used to visit my grandparents in Charlotte, North Carolina during the summer, and I would sit on"
"6763660","6768300"," the front porch of their house and listen to my grandmother tell stories about her life, and she"
"6768300","6773260"," told about how she raised her family in Connecticut in the 1930s during the Great Depression. "
"6773960","6778760"," And it was a town that was specializing in shoe manufacture, and during the Depression a lot of the"
"6778760","6779740"," factories were shut down."
"6780420","6784040"," And she told me that, you know, it was a very hard time."
"6784160","6787680"," A lot of the kids went to school and tattered shoes or maybe no shoes at all. "
"6788340","6790280"," And I said, grandma, why would they do that?"
"6790480","6793080"," And she said, well, because their fathers lost their jobs."
"6793740","6794820"," Why did they lose their jobs?"
"6795660","6797100"," Because the shoe factory shut down."
"6797800","6801540"," Now, I was only six years old, but I could see the problem with that argument. "
"6801980","6806400"," I said, well, why didn't they just open the shoe factories and make shoes for their children?"
"6806580","6808180"," And she said, it doesn't work that way."
"6808180","6815200"," But I think it really was a puzzle to me that you had the same productive capacity in 1933 that"
"6815200","6816300"," you had in 1928."
"6817020","6821240"," And in 1928 people were dancing to Charleston in 1933, they were in bread lines. "
"6822140","6826940"," And that impressed on me, you know, that economics can make really big difference in people's"
"6826940","6827180"," lives."
"6828280","6829900"," And monetary policy is like that."
"6830040","6836060"," I mean, it's, as Jay, of course, and all of you well know that the decisions made in this building"
"6836060","6840000"," have a very broad and real effect on people's lives. "
"6840520","6847800"," And for that reason, besides its intellectual fascination, it's worth studying and understanding."
"6850020","6850860"," Thank you."
"6851020","6855680"," I know that's certainly a key motivation for many people in this room to be working so hard. "
"6856340","6860080"," Okay, let's now turn to some topics of more current interest."
"6860080","6865860"," And I'd like to start with the nexus between the financial system and the macro economy."
"6866680","6873080"," Both of you during your 10 years as chair have faced very significant historic financial crises. "
"6874100","6878360"," Ben, obviously you confronted the global financial crisis and Jay, the global pandemic."
"6878540","6880580"," Yeah, they're stroking each other off right now, definitely."
"6881020","6887800"," A very vivid examples of the connections between the macro economy and the financial system. "
"6888560","6893180"," As well as, I think, a good illustration of the role of central banks in such episodes."
"6894660","6899020"," But, Ben, your research, importantly, and the research that you have inspired has really"
"6899020","6905620"," demonstrated that understanding the connections between the financial sector, credit markets, and"
"6905620","6910900"," banks, and the real economy is critical for even understanding traditional business cycles."
"6911600","6916680"," So with that as background, we have just experienced a period of stress in certain parts of the"
"6916680","6918460"," banking system here in the United States. "
"6919080","6925140"," So I want to get your take on those developments, how you think they match up compared to some"
"6925140","6927520"," previous episodes and what they might mean for the economy."
"6928200","6933560"," Well, in some dimension, the recent crisis has followed as the standard sequence."
"6935160","6939020"," I don't know anything about Silicon Valley Bank other than what I read in the paper, so please"
"6939020","6940580"," don't misinterpret this. "
"6940580","6947580"," But it was a classic situation where they had assets that were subject to risk."
"6947840","6952300"," In particular, as interest rates rose, the value of their long-term assets fell and their capital"
"6952300","6953280"," fell."
"6953980","6962120"," They had hoped to hedge that by their deposit franchise where as interest rates rose and interest"
"6962120","6968100"," rates moved more slowly on deposits that would partially compensate, but they were dealing with"
"6968100","6974220"," customers who were very media, social media savvy, and that didn't really work. "
"6974880","6979440"," So after the decline in capital, you had the second stage, which is runs, people taking out their"
"6979440","6985060"," money, which ultimately led to the collapse of the bank."
"6985560","6990560"," Despite, I may add, the good efforts of the Fed and the FDIC to provide liquidity and provide"
"6990560","6990980"," support."
"6990980","7000920"," Do any of you feel like these banks knew before that rates would increase, that they would"
"7000920","7001960"," need to..."
"7001960","7004360"," There was letters in their name and all kinds of things like that. "
"7004720","7010720"," And that caused for people to begin to remove deposits elsewhere."
"7012320","7019080"," And finally, the reason this is important is that it ultimately affects credit conditions."
"7019080","7026400"," And the Federal Reserve is, of course, looking at the effects of bank problems and other financial"
"7026400","7032680"," issues on the extension of credit and therefore on the real economy. "
"7035720","7040860"," So, in that respect, I think it's very similar to other crises."
"7041300","7046140"," I think it's different from the global financial crisis in many ways, including its scale and"
"7046140","7046780"," scope, of course."
"7046780","7051740"," But bear plain forming right now on S&P 500 here. "
"7051840","7059120"," The impaired asset in this case was U.S. Treasuries, which are very different assets in kind from"
"7059120","7064300"," subprime mortgages, in that U.S. Treasuries can always be valued accurately."
"7064920","7069040"," And so there's not the uncertainty that was associated with subprime mortgages."
"7069540","7075520"," And secondly, as the economy declines, if it does decline, U.S. Treasuries actually become more"
"7075520","7076960"," valuable rather than less valuable. "
"7077160","7079720"," And so there's kind of a countercyclical effect."
"7079940","7081760"," So that's one very important difference, I think."
"7081880","7087800"," And then the other worth meshing, but very important, is that relative to, say, the GFC or the"
"7087800","7094340"," Great Depression, overall borrowers are in much better shape than they were in these previous"
"7094340","7094780"," episodes. "
"7095040","7099080"," And that makes a big difference, both in terms of the stability of the banks and also in terms of"
"7099080","7102420"," the impact on consumer spending and the economy in general."
"7102420","7108860"," Well, I guess a major reason that situation didn't get worse, and I think the contagion was very"
"7108860","7114620"," much contained, were the forceful actions, Jay, that the U and the Federal Reserve took through the"
"7114620","7118040"," use of your liquidity tools, including the creation of the bank."
"7118160","7122900"," Gaps closed on the spy just then, small gap down below closed. "
"7123880","7129620"," That is common, you know, against this backdrop where the preeminent monetary policy concern is"
"7129620","7129960"," high inflation."
"7129960","7133040"," And that's, of course, a little different from some of the earlier episodes."
"7133860","7139440"," And has raised renewed discussions about the so-called separation principle, right?"
"7139640","7145740"," And so I wanted to ask you how you think about the use of financial stability tools and liquidity"
"7145740","7150580"," tools as opposed to more traditional monetary policy tools and how they..."
"7150580","7155000"," Secretary Yellen told bank CEOs more mergers may be necessary. "
"7155000","7161780"," Overall, the banks and the banking system are strong and resilient, and well-positioned to deal"
"7161780","7163980"," with the challenges they may face now or in the future."
"7164920","7169740"," So as you pointed out, we do have separate tools, monetary policy, to achieve our macroeconomic"
"7169740","7172840"," objectives, liquidity, supervisory, and regulatory."
"7173220","7180780"," Howell reinforcing that the banking system is strong and resilient as Secretary Yellen told bank"
"7180780","7182900"," CEOs more mergers may be necessary. "
"7183940","7186640"," But their effects are often not entirely independent."
"7187620","7192600"," So the tools are complementary almost all the time because financial and macroeconomic stability"
"7192600","7194320"," are so deeply intertwined."
"7194900","7200560"," In fact, our consensus statement notes that sustainably achieving maximum employment and price"
"7200560","7203100"," stability depends on a stable financial system. "
"7203580","7208480"," So because they're so intertwined, to me, there is not likely to be an absolute and complete"
"7208480","7211740"," separation of the tools, nor is that possible or desirable."
"7211740","7217860"," And I think as Ben's research and the global financial crisis demonstrated, financial stability"
"7217860","7220360"," affects macroeconomic stability and vice versa."
"7220840","7223000"," We saw that clearly at the outset of the pandemic. "
"7223480","7228660"," As a result, the tools that we use to address concerns in either arena can and will affect both,"
"7228660","7230940"," especially during extreme circumstances."
"7231900","7236280"," That said, yes, the tools are separate, they have individual purposes, and most of the time each"
"7236280","7240600"," can be used for its intended purpose without compromising any other."
"7240600","7243200"," For example, as you pointed out. "
"7243320","7246820"," I'm back into a earlier, I grabbed some puts too."
"7247080","7251100"," So I'm back on fucking, I've got calls, puts once again earlier."
"7251800","7252800"," I grabbed some, just the heads up. "
"7253040","7257560"," And that liquidity supported the stability of the financial system without restricting the use of"
"7257560","7260200"," our monetary policy tools to promote price stability."
"7260760","7265580"," While the financial stability tools help to calm conditions in the banking sector, developments"
"7265580","7271300"," there, on the other hand, are contributing to tighter credit conditions and are likely to weigh on"
"7271300","7273200"," economic growth, hiring, and inflation."
"7273600","7278180"," So as a result, our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to"
"7278180","7278780"," achieve our goals. "
"7279380","7281300"," Of course, the extent of that is highly uncertain."
"7282420","7282780"," So."
"7283700","7284460"," Thank you. "
"7285200","7291460"," And of course that, I think the effectiveness of those tools is reflected in the fact that the FOMC"
"7292200","7296400"," have damaged interest rates twice since the emergence of the banking strains."
"7297080","7297840"," Of course, in that."
"7298000","7298840"," The pawn down there. "
"7299940","7301400"," Confront the inflation issue."
"7302020","7304340"," Which brings us to our next topic, which is in fact inflation."
"7305660","7312040"," You know, in the pandemic and the aftermath, we've had many renewed discussions of the important"
"7312040","7316340"," and classic textbook distinction between supply shocks and demand shocks. "
"7317040","7323440"," And in particular, the particular challenge is that a supply shock can present to a central bank."
"7324420","7329840"," And that's also raised a lot of questions in academia and in policy circles as to whether or not"
"7329840","7333220"," the- China takes some profit on the put side over here to miss and fills right now."
"7333460","7335440"," It's going to look quite different than prior. "
"7336600","7337980"," Jay, maybe we can start with you."
"7338660","7345580"," A number of folks have argued that we are entering a new period where supply shocks will be more"
"7345580","7346020"," frequent."
"7347260","7351880"," We'd love to hear your views on whether you think that's a possibility and what that might mean for"
"7351880","7352480"," central banks. "
"7352980","7357220"," So it's a great question and it's one I think we'll be dealing with for quite a long time."
"7357440","7360680"," And I'd say it's certainly possible that we'll see continued supply shocks."
"7361040","7364220"," I also think it's just very hard to forecast that with any confidence. "
"7365120","7367900"," As Yogi Berra has thought to have said, Ben, you're the baseball expert."
"7368180","7373920"," You can confirm or deny this, but it is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."
"7373920","7378700"," Ben's policy saying it is possible there will be continued supply shocks, but it's hard to predict. "
"7378960","7383840"," To just identify the factors that we think can lead to further negative supply shocks."
"7384360","7386260"," I will say- Still long calls here."
"7386460","7391700"," The supply shocks related to globalization largely probably contributed significantly to the period"
"7391700","7396360"," of low inflation that either ended or was interrupted by the onset of the pandemic. "
"7396360","7401740"," And I'm thinking there of the vast increase in global labor supply, the development of efficient"
"7401740","7406060"," global supply chains, facilitated by technological advances and things like that."
"7406360","7410380"," And I would say those positive supply shocks do not seem likely to be repeated."
"7411420","7416080"," At the same time, the drivers of the current inflationary surge certainly included a sequence of"
"7416080","7421020"," large negative supply shocks to the global supply chain for goods, which also experienced a large"
"7421020","7427040"," and persistent shift in demand from services to goods and also the supply of workers on top of"
"7427040","7427220"," that. "
"7427220","7430740"," Watching this bar right here to see if we squeeze higher."
"7433160","7435900"," The role for one more leg down here."
"7436060","7437200"," I took some money down here. "
"7437420","7440000"," I was trying to chase some profit down here."
"7440740","7444940"," Will the globalization be partially or fully halted or reversed?"
"7445780","7448820"," Will it resume again as the pandemic mercifully receives into memory?"
"7449560","7450820"," We can't really know that now."
"7452820","7460060"," Developments in the banking sector mean policy rates may not need to rise as much to achieve policy"
"7460060","7460540"," goals. "
"7460880","7465660"," It will require us to navigate whatever additional supply shocks do occur."
"7466140","7471620"," So as Tomas and Ben and their co-authors wrote in the inflation targeting book, what a central bank"
"7471620","7473080"," can do is control inflation."
"7473720","7477660"," And that is true over time, even in the presence of supply shocks should they come. "
"7479240","7481140"," Ben, what do you hear of these on this?"
"7481260","7487280"," So unusual events which disrupt normal economic functioning often are followed by inflation."
"7487860","7492940"," Examples are World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and now the pandemic."
"7493660","7497960"," And the pandemic just makes it harder for policymakers to understand what's happening and to react"
"7497960","7499000"," appropriately. "
"7499460","7504880"," In particular, the pandemic scrambled the labor market, made it harder to judge the state of the"
"7504880","7505400"," labor market."
"7505400","7512220"," The opening led to a very extended rise in commodity prices, which was difficult to deal with."
"7512340","7517360"," We had supply chain issues, which was a pretty much a new thing, which was also a contributor to"
"7517360","7517500"," inflation. "
"7517860","7522520"," So there are many features of the pandemic that made this an unusual episode and a difficult"
"7522520","7524340"," episode to address."
"7525600","7531120"," That being said, I think that, and I've done some research on this with Olivier Blancheard that"
"7531120","7536820"," we're presenting next week, the basic mechanisms, I think, are still the same."
"7537600","7539100"," But you have a bunch of bad shocks. "
"7539800","7540920"," That's going to give you a problem."
"7541280","7547500"," But the underlying mechanisms of supply shocks and labor markets and so on."
"7547500","7549260"," We just talk over them speaking right now. "
"7549440","7553220"," So I'm sitting over here buying and selling puts and calls and ships."
"7553520","7554800"," I've still got a stack of calls here."
"7555360","7556940"," This is a one minute chart right here. "
"7556980","7557620"," I'm going to show you."
"7557620","7562360"," The latest pandemic that gave us this episode going forward."
"7562580","7566640"," You can see they're selling right off this CX6 EMA right here. "
"7566920","7568400"," New shocks will come."
"7568740","7570560"," We've got new technologies out there."
"7570660","7575340"," They have price though below the 27 EMA and the one minute chart right now. "
"7575600","7578700"," I'm still sitting in some calls there at a 24 cents."
"7579260","7581860"," I think I bought them at 35 or 36 cents right here."
"7582060","7584160"," These are a 422 C's. "
"7585300","7587740"," I'm trying to capture this move down here."
"7587980","7594440"," I talked earlier about when you have a hedge on the market, you'll see a hit and run regardless of"
"7594440","7597140"," what is talked about to the downside."
"7597140","7604640"," And then you'll see a reversal trade to the upside and try to capture that on a strangle or a"
"7604640","7605880"," straddle that you have on the market. "
"7606360","7609320"," So we'll see if we blast up here."
"7610120","7611700"," Tightness in the inflation process."
"7612960","7618120"," I think it's quite striking that on the eve of the pandemic, the unemployment rate was around three"
"7618120","7620940"," and a half percent, five decade low. "
"7621780","7626920"," At the same time, inflation was kind of struggling to get up to two percent on a sustained basis."
"7627780","7629620"," Here we are in 2023."
"7629840","7633960"," The unemployment rate is roughly at the same level as it was prior to the pandemic, but of course"
"7633960","7634220"," inflation. "
"7634220","7639100"," If price can get up here, signal this move higher."
"7639500","7642040"," Now, watch this right here closely, okay?"
"7642600","7651080"," If we don't, and we continue to tee off to the downside, if we get a green bar here, let's"
"7651080","7658680"," say, or a straight reversal candle, or is that really not the key to understanding inflation in the"
"7658680","7659120"," first place?"
"7659640","7662100"," I'll enter puts again on this side right here."
"7662100","7668340"," Talking about before, I think that the pandemic, to some extent, scrambled the usual signals to the"
"7668340","7673120"," labor market, and the Federal Reserve over time has begun to put more weight on things like the"
"7673120","7679500"," vacancy-done employment ratio, which seems to give a better signal in a period of change when the"
"7679500","7685660"," labor market matching processes is in change than the unemployment rate. "
"7686040","7689560"," So there has been some scrambling of those signals."
"7690360","7697540"," That being said, it's simply not true that, you know, even in people who have understood since the"
"7697540","7702380"," 70s, that there's not a simple inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment."
"7703760","7707540"," In particular, what can break that relationship as supply?"
"7707740","7714000"," That swaps downgrade June hike odds after debt limit talks stall. "
"7714900","7719180"," GOP debt limit negotiator Graves, the talks are at a pause."
"7719860","7722460"," Debt limit talks are at a pause."
"7723180","7730680"," US interest rate futures traders slash bets on June fed rate hike and add to bets on fed rate cuts"
"7730680","7732400"," later in the year. "
"7734040","7740880"," Inflation expectations dynamics, there's no reason why low unemployment and high inflation can't"
"7740880","7741420"," coexist."
"7743120","7747740"," But the remedies might be, depending on the situation, might be somewhat different."
"7749420","7750940"," Jay, how are you thinking about that?"
"7751020","7752520"," Very much in agreement with that. "
"7752680","7758540"," You know, it's certainly true that we had both before and after the pandemic inflation very, sorry,"
"7758660","7763760"," unemployment very low close to three and a half percent, but that we only had high inflation after"
"7763760","7764520"," the pandemic."
"7764780","7769020"," Does that mean that our understanding of the relationship between slack and inflation is badly"
"7769020","7771860"," wrong or that it has changed fundamentally after the pandemic?"
"7772280","7775120"," And my answer would be tentatively no to both of those questions."
"7775600","7777200"," I think we're real careful here. "
"7777340","7778980"," This is really bearish right here."
"7779720","7782360"," Watching this reversal candle right now."
"7782600","7789400"," I don't think labor market slack was a particularly important feature of inflation when it first"
"7789400","7791740"," spiked in spring of 2021. "
"7792040","7797340"," By contrast, I do think that labor market slack is likely to be an increasingly important factor in"
"7797340","7798920"," inflation going forward."
"7798920","7804800"," In particular, inflation in non-housing services is showing signs of real persistent in this highly"
"7804800","7805900"," diverse sector."
"7806400","7811760"," Labor costs are a high proportion of total costs, and that sector happens to account for more than"
"7811760","7814720"," half of the core PC index. "
"7816240","7818140"," But all of this, the point is all of this."
"7818140","7822880"," Doesn't it, like I'm in straddles and strangles, and I'm like trying to like clean up money on both"
"7822880","7823280"," sides."
"7823440","7825200"," I keep that fingering a bunch of these trades. "
"7825920","7828200"," I'm trying to close one side, not the other."
"7828580","7831180"," And I'm like, oh, you want to close it all right now?"
"7831320","7833440"," I'm like, no, I don't want to fucking close it all right now."
"7834300","7836840"," I'm like, I want to fucking close one side right now. "
"7838780","7841140"," In 2021, then it did in 2018."
"7842560","7847560"," And as Ben mentioned, of course, after the pandemic, we began looking at much more closely at"
"7847560","7851900"," alternative measures, particularly vacancies, but also quits, which have been so long."
"7851900","7856240"," Yeah, you got old yelling out there trying to just put the fire logs on the fire right now in"
"7856240","7856580"," the background. "
"7857320","7858840"," She's like doom and gloom."
"7861320","7867260"," We at the end of 2018 and the end of 2021, we had 4% roughly unemployment in both cases."
"7867380","7869500"," In 2018, things are bad. "
"7869500","7874080"," You got you got you got Paul out here saying the banking system is resilient."
"7874080","7877280"," And you've got, you know, yelling, changing her tune every week."
"7878060","7881960"," At that time of the simple standalone unemployment rate. "
"7882080","7886200"," Oh, that was the natural rate being highly elevated."
"7886940","7892320"," The other thing is, you know, it may also be the case that the Phillips curve has steeped"
"7892320","7897180"," steepened, meaning that inflation has returned, at least for now, to being more responsive to"
"7897180","7897940"," changes in the labor."
"7898240","7899240"," Yeah, I agree with John. "
"7899540","7901640"," I agree right now with you on Bernanke."
"7902100","7905180"," I was, when I first saw Bernanke, I was like, man, he looks the same."
"7906360","7910460"," He reminded me of like Rumsfeld, like they wheel him out of the coffin. "
"7910880","7911960"," And they're like, here he is."
"7912100","7913340"," He's still alive and looks great."
"7914240","7915640"," It's like, what's his name there?"
"7915780","7920980"," Who is the guy that they, who is the guy from my, I stopped, I learned to stop worrying and"
"7920980","7922100"," learned to love the bomb. "
"7922960","7928220"," And they, and they made that character after after I forget the guy's name from"
"7928220","7935540"," the city."
"7936020","7938440"," Let me see what this guy was based on."
"7938680","7943980"," I've been powerful advocates for advancing monetary policy communications, both with an eye toward"
"7943980","7945220"," making policy more effective. "
"7945780","7946940"," Yeah, what's, who's the guy?"
"7947240","7951200"," Who's the golem that we had in the 50s, 60s and 70s?"
"7951920","7953060"," Khrushchev, not Khrushchev."
"7953260","7955080"," He was Israeli, I think."
"7955800","7958800"," He was in the U.S. like inner circle cabinet. "
"7959320","7960000"," What was his name?"
"7960460","7961960"," He wanted like World War III."
"7963900","7965900"," So what changes over this period?"
"7966360","7966420"," Kissinger."
"7967240","7967960"," You got it. "
"7968120","7968260"," Kissinger."
"7968820","7969820"," That's the, that's the guy."
"7970300","7971760"," Like he's still alive, right?"
"7972060","7973740"," Kissinger's still out there making policy. "
"7976340","7978280"," Dr. Strangelove, you got it."
"7978620","7979480"," No, no, no, no, Kissinger."
"7980460","7982020"," Some of you guys are old enough to remember him. "
"7982260","7986340"," To try to align market expectations with the Fed's own thinking."
"7987760","7989580"," I think that goes back to Alan Greenspan."
"7989580","7990920"," Go back to 1994. "
"7990980","7991700"," Come on."
"7991980","8000400"," Since then, you know, the Fed has tried at least to give some indication of what's thinking and"
"8000400","8002180"," what it sees as the risk to the economy."
"8002540","8005640"," But beyond that, you mentioned transparency and accountability. "
"8006520","8007600"," This is a powerful institution."
"8007880","8011720"," Keep trying to jump in this fucking trade and I keep getting up chasing like money."
"8011940","8017240"," The best way to do that is explain what we think, what we're doing, you know, and how, and how"
"8017240","8018180"," we're going to go about that. "
"8018940","8021260"," There's other reasons for communication."
"8021820","8023460"," One I would talk about is feedback."
"8024480","8025220"," We're having a."
"8025420","8027600"," Whoa, look at that supply down there, baby. "
"8028160","8030340"," Look at that supply down there."
"8030860","8031940"," What is that for?"
"8033240","8034120"," Or tweet."
"8034580","8036900"," More 175, baby. "
"8037880","8043580"," Or in the case of the Fed listens program, maybe it would be more ordinary people who are"
"8043580","8047460"," explaining, you know, how monetary policy affects them."
"8048000","8055140"," One final thing I would mention is diversity of views because the Fed has a consensus culture and"
"8055140","8056600"," there are very few descents normally."
"8057880","8062780"," The outside perception is that this green bar down here is our hourly trigger down here. "
"8063280","8064740"," Let me make sure I got that number right."
"8065160","8067340"," You know, their own views and explaining."
"8067620","8076080"," VIX trading into its hourly trigger right now, trading up to $16.53. There is a range of opinion on"
"8076080","8077200"," the committee. "
"8077960","8084560"," In terms of tools, I guess I do feel proud about the press conferences, which I early triggers that"
"8084560","8088560"," for 18.03. Let's write up here."
"8088940","8090940"," Paul has taken to an art form."
"8093520","8102660"," And the, I think also, you know, just the inflation target, the forecast that we were going to"
"8102660","8102660"," release. "
"8103620","8109100"," And there is a cultural change, which some people don't like, but I think that net is good, which"
"8109100","8115080"," is it used to be, if you look back at speeches in the Greenspan era, the president of the Federal"
"8115080","8116200"," Reserve Bank of..."
"8116200","8117020"," Right here."
"8117560","8120540"," You know, we would talk about, you know, harvests or something."
"8120720","8123280"," We wouldn't talk very much about the global or national economy. "
"8123680","8127760"," Now you have a lot of people talking about, you know, the different aspects of the Federal"
"8127760","8128780"," Reserve's views."
"8129720","8139180"," And, again, that contributes to both market transparency and also to accountability to the local"
"8139180","8140860"," constituency and to the national constituency."
"8142400","8143040"," Okay. "
"8143140","8147520"," You, of course, have continued to push forward on the communications and transparency fronts."
"8148080","8148740"," Welcome your thoughts."
"8149360","8153580"," You know, I think the broader setting is that transparency..."
"8153580","8155920"," VIX trading higher than its hourly trigger. "
"8155920","8159180"," Squeezing higher right now on ZIVIX."
"8159780","8163700"," institutions globally have struggled to retain the public's trust and support."
"8163880","8166840"," Of course, 17Ps trading 63 cents right now. "
"8167120","8169800"," My call side is down to 12 cents right now."
"8170840","8176100"," The particulars of what we do and how we do it are not generally top of mind for most people."
"8177260","8180980"," And on top of that, we have a critical and a rare grant of independence. "
"8181360","8186040"," And all of that to me means that we have a special obligation to explain ourselves clear clearly"
"8186040","8191320"," what we do, why we do it, to provide transparency to the public and their elected representatives"
"8191320","8195920"," in Congress so that we can earn and deserve their trust and support."
"8196680","8202320"," And that's a critical task if we are going to sustain our democratic legitimacy through this"
"8202320","8203860"," interesting period."
"8204680","8209719"," VIX coming back down right now, but the price of VIX is coming down onto its hourly trigger. "
"8209980","8214680"," The one minute is racing and the five minute is racing to the upside here."
"8214680","8218200"," We should get one more bloodbath move down on the spy."
"8219860","8226379"," If you haven't been able to chase this, you should get an opportunity to chase it at 4.19.08."
"8226719","8229719"," Greater transparency and accountability and a couple of examples. "
"8230500","8233360"," We now do a press conference after every meeting, not just every other one."
"8233740","8238520"," We have greatly expanded our congressional outreach to be certain that we hear directly from"
"8238520","8240680"," lawmakers on an ongoing basis."
"8240680","8245780"," And also so that they have the information that they need to conduct appropriate oversight. "
"8246400","8251520"," As I mentioned in 2019 and 20, we conducted a public review of our monetary policy framework"
"8251520","8256080"," seeking input from a broad range of people and groups all around the country."
"8256760","8260540"," We've also significantly expanded transparency beyond monetary policy."
"8260980","8265879"," For example, we now publish semi-annual financial stability and supervision and regulation reports. "
"8265879","8273440"," Of course, there are always communication challenges, especially I find about communicating the"
"8273440","8277520"," uncertainty that attends our assessments of economic conditions in the outlook."
"8278780","8284520"," And the good example of this is, despite our persistent efforts to explain otherwise, the policy"
"8284520","8291000"," paths from the SCP seem regularly to be taken as a firm plan or a committee decision, rather than"
"8291000","8295799"," what they are, which is a compilation of individual participants' best assessments on a particular"
"8295799","8301260"," day of appropriate policy under the assumption that conditions evolve in line with their baseline"
"8301260","8301559"," forecasts."
"8302480","8306799"," So that's just a challenge that we constantly face in the context of great uncertainty. "
"8307459","8311799"," Despite that, I would say though that the summer of economic projections has actually been very"
"8311799","8316480"," useful during this tightening cycle, as markets have looked ahead and priced in future rate hikes"
"8316480","8318440"," long before they're actually implemented."
"8319639","8322480"," 417 is trading 73 cents right now."
"8323660","8325299"," 76 cents right now. "
"8326520","8329780"," And I guess the key element of that is the use of forward guidance."
"8331320","8336639"," Jay, in one school of thought, forward guidance is a tool that should really only be deployed when"
"8336639","8338639"," interest rates are at the effect of lower bound."
"8338980","8342340"," And so you can no longer provide accommodation by lowering rates further. "
"8342340","8347559"," One minute crossing the hourly trigger on VIX right now."
"8347740","8350180"," VIX up at 1694, baby."
"8350400","8355860"," Regular part of communicating with the public to convey the committee's policy intentions even far"
"8355860","8357580"," away from the effective lower bound. "
"8358080","8359540"," Where do you come out in that debate?"
"8359920","8361740"," I do think it depends on circumstances."
"8362260","8367420"," I do think that forward guidance can be useful when policymakers have a materially different or"
"8367420","8371920"," clearer view of the likely path of policy than does the interested public."
"8371920","8377299"," I would agree at the effect of lower bound when we need to provide more stimulus by indicating an"
"8377299","8380520"," intent to keep policy accommodative longer than the public expects. "
"8380879","8382100"," There's a use case there."
"8382860","8389560"," I also would say though that communication comes with a cost of misinterpretation and it also may"
"8389560","8390320"," limit flexibility."
"8391080","8396360"," So I think we should use forward guidance sparingly when the course of policy is either reasonably"
"8396360","8401780"," well understood or on the contrary is so dependent on uncertain future development. "
"8401780","8405780"," There are developments that little really can be said constructively about the future."
"8406220","8409940"," And a good example of that was the March 2020 FOMC meeting."
"8410700","8413400"," The pandemic shutdowns were just beginning. "
"8413740","8415580"," The level of certainty was almost unimaginable."
"8415820","8419580"," And we'd chosen not to issue an SEP at that point."
"8419800","8425500"," Really our view was that releasing a forecast at that time might have been more of an obstacle to"
"8425500","8426900"," clear communication than a help. "
"8427500","8432140"," In contrast, as I mentioned a minute ago, forward guidance has really been a useful and effective"
"8432140","8437400"," tool during the current tightening cycle as financial conditions have tightened well in advance of"
"8437400","8438320"," actual rate increases."
"8439060","8444560"," You know, the two year tighten between the September 21 meeting and lift off in March of 20"
"8444560","8450100"," tightened by 200 basis points before we ever actually lifted rates and that's significantly because"
"8450100","8450620"," of our communication."
"8450620","8457600"," So in the current context until recently it's been relatively clear that further policy firming"
"8457600","8461540"," would be warranted and our forward guidance has said so has said so. "
"8461960","8466060"," Now, however, we've come a long way in policy tightening and the stance of policy is restrictive."
"8466700","8471840"," And we face uncertainty about the lag defects of our tightening so far and about the extent of"
"8471840","8473860"," credit tightening from recent banking stresses."
"8473860","8480100"," So today our guidance is limiting limited to identifying the factors will be monitoring as we"
"8480100","8485900"," assess the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2%"
"8485900","8486460"," over time. "
"8487060","8491780"," As I noted at the last press conference, that assessment will be an ongoing one as we move ahead"
"8491780","8492840"," meeting by meeting."
"8493220","8498180"," Having come this far, we can afford to look at the data and the evolving outlook and make careful"
"8498180","8498500"," assessments."
"8500220","8501180"," Thank you. "
"8501540","8507660"," Jay, you mentioned that guidance can be useful at times when the public may expect a very different"
"8507660","8509460"," policy path than policy makers."
"8510040","8511540"," How do you think about those sorts of situations?"
"8512380","8512960"," You're right."
"8513200","8517020"," So recently it has sometimes been the case that markets appear to be pricing in a different rate"
"8517020","8519040"," path than the committee expects will be appropriate. "
"8519040","8524460"," But I would say that that disconnect does not seem to reflect a misunderstanding of our reaction"
"8524460","8528480"," function or a lack of belief that will do what's necessary to bring inflation down."
"8528720","8534140"," Rather, it appears to reflect simply a different forecast, one in which inflation comes down much"
"8534140","8539280"," more quickly than the committee participants think is most likely, perhaps due to a significant"
"8539280","8539680"," downturn."
"8540400","8544740"," I would say also, so far the data have continued to support the committee's view that bringing"
"8544740","8546840"," inflation down will take some time. "
"8547800","8554620"," Moreover, something we often don't remember to think about is that market prices always reflect"
"8554620","8557960"," both expectations and compensation for risk."
"8558720","8563900"," And what market participants say in surveys of their expectations is actually closer to the views"
"8563900","8567060"," in the SCP than what is reflected in market pricing."
"8569300","8573380"," My colleagues and I have our forecasts and market participants have theirs. "
"8573720","8576100"," Our role is not to advocate for our forecast."
"8576820","8582320"," What we can do is be clear about our expectations for growth, unemployment and inflation, and the"
"8582320","8584140"," likely implications for policy."
"8584820","8589620"," As well, we want the public to understand how policy would react if the path of the economy were to"
"8589620","8591480"," differ materially from our expectations. "
"8591480","8598400"," And a price breaking through hourly trigger, one in five minutes coming down hard and fast on it"
"8598400","8602800"," right now for a three trigger bearish cluster to the downside."
"8603840","8605180"," Can we get down here?"
"8605420","8608580"," The co-authors have made a useful distinction between what they call a logician."
"8608800","8615800"," 82 cents right now and 417 P long ago paid for the call side of that straddle. "
"8617300","8620560"," Where the central bank promises to do something."
"8620780","8621820"," We can get down here."
"8622720","8624060"," Follow a certain path. "
"8624420","8626880"," I'm going to close out the put side here momentarily."
"8627400","8634820"," Again, that goes back again down in Greenspan, I think, to indicate that a certain path was very"
"8634820","8638660"," likely and that actually helps achieve the objectives."
"8639040","8641460"," Delphic Ford guidance is basically just a forecast. "
"8641460","8642260"," Here's what we think."
"8642680","8647360"," Tomorrow we might think something different, but we're just trying to as part of our 87 cents right"
"8647360","8649520"," now on 417 P's."
"8649640","8653880"," 90 cents right now for 17 P's. "
"8654640","8655760"," Come on, baby."
"8657160","8662740"," When is people don't understand 94 cents right now on 417 P."
"8663420","8668120"," That's something that Jay has emphasized and I think that should be emphasized."
"8668120","8672560"," Another is people underestimate the amount of uncertainty involved, which is. "
"8672660","8676360"," Let right now on 417 P hit $1."
"8677040","8678780"," Now they're at $1 too."
"8679180","8682200"," The idea of transparency says I'm out before then though. "
"8682260","8682840"," So I'm down."
"8682980","8683820"," I'm out $1."
"8684180","8688320"," They're now trading $1.3. So I've paid for the call side. "
"8688600","8690960"," Those are still at seven cents right now."
"8691000","8693320"," So there's still a little bit of money on those."
"8693920","8696380"," So that trade will end up only costing me. "
"8696380","8697520"," I don't know."
"8697700","8699860"," I think it would be like 20 cents or something."
"8700340","8701500"," So at least I'm up. "
"8701600","8703780"," I'm up like 50 cents, 70 cents right now."
"8703920","8708120"," The F1C is so large and geographically dispersed that it's been difficult to come up with a"
"8708120","8708820"," collect."
"8708960","8712080"," Still have this supply to the downside right here. "
"8712080","8712980"," You can see it."
"8713400","8714940"," The dot plot is a compromise."
"8715340","8716300"," Right here. "
"8716980","8718660"," Other central banks do other things."
"8718960","8724500"," Sometimes they have collective committee forecasts that are voted on or they use market rates."
"8725240","8727120"," Or they publish the staff forecast. "
"8727120","8730160"," I'm going to look at 416 P's now."
"8730360","8731920"," They're 51 cents currently."
"8732980","8740460"," But again, letting people know sort of how the central bank sees the 35 cent for 16 P's. "
"8742320","8745020"," Normally is is part of transparency."
"8746600","8751960"," So you highlighted uncertainty as being a key factor in dealing with some of these issues."
"8751960","8759260"," Obviously, uncertainty is a pervasive feature of monetary policy making along 416 P right now. "
"8760320","8762560"," Now they're trading 58 cents."
"8763000","8765600"," We'll see if we can get down here and hit this target down below."
"8767360","8772520"," The F1C's raised the federal funds rate by 5 percentage points in a little more than a year. "
"8773020","8776480"," That's a very rapid pace by historical standards, as we all know."
"8776480","8783820"," How do you view those actions in the context of the uncertainties that you and some buyers stepping"
"8783820","8784320"," in here."
"8784420","8787700"," How did risk management considerations factor into your decisions?"
"8788500","8794180"," So I'll start by remembering that Alan Greenspan famously said that pervasive uncertainty was the"
"8794180","8796380"," defining characteristic of the policy landscape. "
"8796900","8799280"," It's worth remembering that he made that comment during."
"8799440","8804060"," So Powell saying the relationship between labor markets, slack and inflation is not different from"
"8804060","8806120"," before the panic or the pandemic."
"8806120","8806780"," Excuse me. "
"8807300","8810200"," The labor market slack did not figure into early inflation."
"8810720","8815220"," But I do think labor slack will be a factor in inflation going forward."
"8815460","8820840"," We all know that the unemployment rate is really what we want to be watching for when we actually"
"8820840","8821920"," hit true recession. "
"8822880","8827920"," Inflation and non housing services, particularly susceptible to labor outcomes, inflation may be"
"8827920","8831780"," more responsive to changes in jobs market."
"8832940","8840000"," On that same note, Representative Graves stepped in and said we've decided to press pause on debt "
"8840000","8844380","-sailing talks because it's just not productive right now."
"8844740","8851240"," The summary of economic projections has been helpful during the tightening cycle and has helped the"
"8851240","8852760"," markets on forward pricing. "
"8853580","8856800"," Fed's forward guidance depends upon the circumstances."
"8857580","8861280"," It's helpful when policymakers have a clear view of things."
"8862020","8866340"," Until recently, clear further, uh, firming was warranted. "
"8866660","8871120"," The Fed has come a long way with uncertainty about lack effects of policy."
"8871680","8877440"," Guidance today is limited to assessing conditions that might warrant further firming."
"8878040","8881320"," Recently markets have been pricing in a different rate path. "
"8881320","8886580"," That seems to reflect a different forecast of inflation coming down more quickly."
"8887460","8893420"," So far data appears to support the committee's view that lowering inflation will take time."
"8893860","8896360"," Data supports the view that inflation will be slow. "
"8897060","8900520"," We can afford to look at data and the ongoing outlook."
"8901120","8909300"," This is too somewhat to the point of, uh, possibly a Fed pause this summer being priced into the"
"8909300","8909700"," market."
"8910140","8914940"," The Fed's power also said the market rate path differs from the Fed's forecast. "
"8915660","8920460"," Policy is restrictive and we are concerned about the lag effects of tightening."
"8922720","8923860"," How does it work in fact?"
"8924180","8928420"," Uncertainty when your academic is trying to decide whether your error term is Gaussian or not."
"8928900","8936120"," Um, in, uh, in, in actual policy making, you don't even know what the current quarter GDP is"
"8936120","8938880"," because it's gonna get revised, you know, several times. "
"8938920","8941280"," Hourly trigger holding strong right now."
"8941460","8946440"," Uh, on the, just as a member of the board and, and Greenspan was in, in, in the chair."
"8947060","8950960"," And, uh, we had, I didn't get a fucking fill in these puts, man. "
"8951380","8953360"," I thought I had the fill and I didn't."
"8953460","8955600"," Change had been revised away."
"8956580","8961500"," And I asked kind of pissy right now at a, at a, uh, tasty trade right now. "
"8961500","8962140"," It is very difficult."
"8962420","8968520"," I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I got a laugh with that, but, uh, you know, trying to make"
"8968520","8973180"," policy, it involves not just uncertainty about, you know, the."
"8973240","8974500"," Where you set my broker here. "
"8974600","8979580"," The model about all the things that can happen about the social and economic and political"
"8979580","8980260"," environment."
"8981100","8982420"," Um, so it's very difficult."
"8982760","8989180"," And unfortunately, or fortunately, the, given that monetary policy works with a lag, um, given that"
"8989180","8995720"," there are risks on both sides of the, of the mobile forecast is not much choice, but just to, uh,"
"8995880","9001660"," accept that uncertainty and try and, you know, do the best you can, being ready to adjust as new"
"9001660","9002460"," information arrives. "
"9004220","9004880"," Very good."
"9005180","9005480"," Thank you."
"9005560","9007800"," We're getting close to the end of our allotted time. "
"9008400","9011280"," Um, maybe we could wrap up with just a quick question looking ahead."
"9012140","9013820"," Um, Jamie, we can start with you."
"9014300","9020380"," What do you, what would you point to with some of the key issues that will be most relevant to"
"9020380","9024160"," the research community as well as, uh, to the policy making community?"
"9024760","9028960"," So I guess, I guess I would start with the labor market and, you know, what we talked about"
"9028960","9036240"," earlier, um, um, vacancies in particular and, and the beverage curve and, and the whole discussion"
"9036240","9043680"," over, over whether, um, the extraordinarily high level of surplus demand in the labor market can be"
"9043680","9049420"," lessened through the vacancies channel without a significant increase in, uh, in unemployment. "
"9049800","9053640"," That would be more akin to what has happened in, in all prior cycles or most prior cycles."
"9053740","9057820"," So that's, that's going to be a question that we will resolve empirically, but I think we're"
"9057820","9063000"," learning new things about the workings of the labor market, at least in this one, uh, situation."
"9063480","9069780"," I think on, um, uh, on monetary policy, it's going to be interesting to look back and try to"
"9069780","9075500"," understand how inflation spread from what was very, uh, at the beginning, very focused. "
"9075640","9078000"," I am chasing all over the place here."
"9078140","9079500"," Like, I'm trying to buy a bunch of calls."
"9080180","9082280"," My broker dude is not filling me on the call. "
"9082280","9084200"," Like, on this, on this squeeze right here."
"9084640","9089220"," I'm like chasing, trying to catch calls on the way up and they're just like, nope, nope, nope,"
"9089680","9089740"," nope."
"9090520","9095140"," And I'm like 35 cents, 36 cents, 38 cents, 40 cents. "
"9095140","9098400"," Let me just catch this, this rip higher right now."
"9098800","9101060"," My broker is pissing me off this morning."
"9101460","9103680"," Where we see persistent inflation is now in the service sector. "
"9103880","9105960"," So what is the mechanism by which that happens?"
"9106700","9107520"," And what are the implications?"
"9109040","9110140"," Ben, you have the last word."
"9110840","9116420"," Well, I think one of the things that I would urge researchers to look at is like chasing puts down,"
"9116420","9123160"," like adding, adding, adding to a position, not getting fills, chasing calls up this morning, not"
"9123160","9123700"," getting fills."
"9123880","9125620"," Are any of you guys having the same issue out there?"
"9127080","9130980"," As Mark Twain once said, the things you don't know. "
"9131120","9134660"," Yeah, I'm having problems getting fills this morning across the board all over the place."
"9135600","9140460"," So on the downside, on the upside, like I'm just like actively going in trying to chase this shit"
"9140460","9141660"," down and chase this shit up."
"9142040","9148240"," The relationship between different aspects of monetary policy, risk taking balance sheet behavior,"
"9148240","9149180"," et cetera. "
"9149180","9152200"," And it's just something."
"9152380","9154320"," I'm having real problems here in my broker."
"9154580","9155000"," It's very rare. "
"9155260","9157560"," Sometimes I have these issues, but it's very rare."
"9158300","9161640"," Today, specifically, I've been having issues all morning reset my broker twice."
"9162140","9170040"," I didn't re-logged in this morning and then I just reset my broker about five minutes ago, I think. "
"9170700","9172520"," And still having issues with fills."
"9173420","9177140"," Well, let me thank both of you tremendously for sharing your perspectives with us today."
"9177140","9180480"," So the Fed Chair Powell is done speaking. "
"9181640","9182880"," So thank you very much."
"9183260","9185600"," The vault event for the day is done."
"9193760","9196220"," We've got stacks of puts. "
"9197660","9201780"," For fuel to the upside, we'll see if we can get a retracement."
"9203980","9207160"," It's a $4.19.59 or just before it."
"9209320","9217260"," We've got some $4.20s. They're still holding those $4.22s on the call side, not put, not put side"
"9217260","9218500"," $4.20 Cs. "
"9219020","9223260"," And $4.22 Cs."
"9223320","9224820"," I'm still on those as well right now."
"9268260","9270160"," Yeah, I normally don't trade market orders. "
"9270400","9271500"," I'm always on limit orders."
"9271780","9273360"," I'm always like, I want that exact penny."
"9274000","9279400"," Because I can get torched on zero dates like fucking four, five, six, seven cents. "
"9279720","9283940"," I'm trying to like scrape and scalp like 10, 20, 30, 40 cents."
"9290080","9291260"," I've never been ripped off."
"9291440","9295620"," I've been able to call my broker later and say, you know, you fucked me on this trade or you"
"9295620","9296540"," fucked me on that trade. "
"9297160","9301120"," If the trade is like sizable enough, I'll be like, man, you just took me for like two or three"
"9301120","9301360"," grand."
"9302060","9303400"," I'm like this bullshit."
"9331310","9335390"," Watching VIX right now, VIX settling down underneath its hourly trigger. "
"9335650","9339890"," We'll see if the one minute can send the VIX lower here."
"9340170","9341430"," We'll see if we can get a nice fat rejection."
"9341910","9345490"," I'll show you guys this so you can see it in the background and the foreground. "
"9346950","9359660"," So I"
"9359660","9361840"," see this VIX get a reversal here."
"9371340","9377000"," If VIX breaks above 16, 70, there could be more down to go."
"9377300","9381240"," So at home, keep your eyes on that VIX at 16, 70. "
"9385610","9390730"," On spy, we did catch the bounce on hourly trigger on trend to the upside."
"9390730","9397290"," I'd like to see if we can target at least 419 in some change."
"9398330","9401630"," 419, 44, 419, 40, somewhere in here. "
"9402230","9403790"," It gives us a quick scalp right in here."
"9444650","9451410"," Fed's Powell saying one more statement that the Fed was expecting further tightening until"
"9451410","9452010"," recently."
"9453090","9455310"," So Powell rolling back some of his comments. "
"9456090","9465470"," I guess in his last rate hike decision meeting, the prepared statements, the language changed."
"9466830","9474250"," And his language also changed in that rate decision where he said, you know, this is not a pause."
"9474410","9481710"," And then, of course, later on in that conversation that he had with reporters, he did roll back his"
"9481710","9484950"," verbiage to state that they're in a weight in C."
"9485890","9487690"," Mode for summertime. "
"9488090","9489310"," We're going to wait and see what happens."
"9490150","9492050"," And we'll make our decisions then."
"9492270","9496250"," There is some verbiage change that they are looking at a pause for the summertime. "
"9497250","9506590"," So Fed Chair Powell's statements today reinforcing that statement of a possible pause"
"9506590","9510070"," on rate hikes this summer."
"9510070","9513270"," Fed was expecting further tightening until recently."
"9513630","9515050"," That's a quote from Jerome Powell. "
"9515750","9522330"," The U.S. Republican leader McConnell Biden waited months before agreeing to negotiate with McCarthy"
"9522330","9523690"," on a spending deal."
"9524130","9526530"," They are the only two who can reach an agreement."
"9527370","9529530"," It is past time for the president to get serious. "
"9530270","9531430"," Time is of the essence."
"9531750","9532390"," That was a tweet."
"9532970","9534650"," A tweet from McConnell. "
"9535830","9540850"," The object is the Fed's chair, Powell also said the object is to reach a stance of policy that is"
"9540850","9542110"," sufficiently restrictive."
"9542890","9545730"," Have not made any decision about how much firming may be appropriate."
"9547450","9549650"," He also said policy is restrictive. "
"9550190","9555330"," And we are concerned about the lag effects of tightening the market rate path differs from the"
"9555330","9555770"," Fed's forecasting."
"9555770","9557610"," We read that one to you earlier."
"9564340","9566700"," Yeah, I'm still on calls here right now. "
"9581300","9584900"," Nick saying Biden will end up having to force a debt ceiling raise."
"9585160","9586320"," He can do it on his own."
"9589940","9591180"," Wouldn't that be a court battle?"
"9591440","9591980"," Do I have that wrong?"
"9602920","9603940"," I could have that wrong. "
"9604340","9606060"," I don't know that the market will react well to that."
"9606140","9607560"," I think price is going to matter here."
"9608340","9610180"," I think overall like price in them. "
"9610440","9612620"," I think like market price overrides."
"9613680","9615760"," Like what the market news is."
"9615760","9619440"," So if you see like debt ceiling solved and we're at 427. "
"9620340","9622800"," I think it's like a sell the market kind of moments."
"9623440","9627320"," I think if they're like debt ceiling crisis not solved and we're at 427."
"9628060","9629060"," It's sell the market. "
"9629060","9636780"," If it's a, you know, like I forgot like 420 or 418 or 415 and they solve the debt crisis"
"9636780","9640160"," probably buy to go to 427 somewhere in there."
"9648420","9651460"," Yeah, debt or so debt or vol is done for the day today."
"9651560","9653120"," So I don't know if we have any other vault. "
"9653300","9654060"," They don't think that we do."
"9662750","9664950"," That's all I've got on my calendar for today."
"9665090","9671170"," We've got the Euro close that already already took place earlier today next week for economics. "
"9672030","9676490"," We have we've got nothing scheduled for Monday on Tuesday."
"9676490","9679410"," We've got the S&P flash US services PMI."
"9679430","9682370"," That's a big one manufacturing PMI. "
"9682390","9683010"," That's a big one."
"9683130","9684170"," We've got new home sales."
"9684790","9686730"," I'm actually interested in these. "
"9687290","9690110"," I've seen there's like I was reading on Fintuit."
"9690290","9693850"," People were like worst housing market in history."
"9694330","9699270"," I'm like, that's not what I know for a fact is this spring housing is crazy. "
"9700630","9705450"," From my experience, people that I know out there, there's not a lot of stock on market that I put"
"9705450","9707390"," that out, but I can see maybe it's because of where I live."
"9708950","9712030"," There's no stock spring selling season is going great right now."
"9712910","9713750"," There's a lot of demand. "
"9714010","9715510"," Matter of fact, Barstool sports yesterday."
"9716410","9719910"," Guy put out an article and op-ed piece and he was like, I'm moving on."
"9720030","9722410"," I think he said he's moving out of Texas to Chicago. "
"9722410","9725610"," And he was like, same old bullshit."
"9726370","9733270"," I have to get down and give blow jobs and hand jobs to like offer 20% above asking."
"9733930","9738170"," So I want to really see what these spring numbers are once we come into summertime. "
"9738870","9742630"," I think we're going to see inflation spike up again in summer from those housing sales."
"9744450","9748810"," On Wednesday, that's where the big bad boy is."
"9749610","9750790"," Wednesday, we have the minutes. "
"9752210","9754450"," Feds may FOMC meeting."
"9755430","9758990"," Those are going to be critical to find out what the true discussion was."
"9760170","9761530"," Behind the scenes. "
"9762450","9768110"," We'll find out if on Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday, May 24th."
"9768110","9775870"," That they were likely, I'm going to guess here, shot in the dark that likely they're going to say"
"9775870","9777550"," that they're discussing a pause."
"9778690","9780670"," Coming up for the summer months. "
"9781650","9786490"," No major market crash as of yet here in the stock market."
"9786990","9789630"," We have the normal hedge coming into an event."
"9790410","9791510"," We blasted down. "
"9792250","9793890"," We now know that the meeting is over."
"9793890","9796270"," There's no more volatility today to speak of."
"9796630","9801710"," Do the bears get continuation to the downside into this close?"
"9802190","9806270"," Or do we get the slow bleed off into next week?"
"9806750","9809930"," That's my posit here is that into next week. "
"9812530","9814050"," I'm going to show this here."
"9814630","9819770"," Mark that number above on your book map above here."
"9819870","9821850"," Let me see if we can do this right here. "
"9824170","9828710"," Right above here just selling into this supply above where that zone is right there."
"9829510","9833690"," And let's look at next week."
"9845340","9848280"," Nice pin strike above at 420. "
"9849840","9850760"," 88."
"9852120","9854340"," Gorgeous number up there looks great."
"9855340","9860640"," Cell side Autobots stepping into cell on the open today. "
"9861600","9865320"," Bears still not getting a full retracement from yesterday at this point."
"9865360","9867580"," They want that into the close if they can get it."
"9868080","9870260"," We know that that they want that badly. "
"9870720","9871860"," Like we're not done here."
"9871980","9872720"," We're selling down."
"9872860","9874180"," There's no way we're trading 420. "
"9874880","9877720"," We're trading 412 again."
"9879220","9880900"," We're going to we want down at 412."
"9882140","9886380"," So let's take a look here and see for next week what the expectation would be. "
"9889940","9892080"," Look at that beautiful ramp right there."
"9892740","9894260"," Look at that gorgeous ramp."
"9895460","9897580"," We're going to go back in time, baby. "
"9901170","9902630"," Back in time."
"9906700","9907780"," No, I don't need this."
"9907920","9908580"," I need to do boxes. "
"9912860","9915460"," I bet some of you out there are getting like flashbacks."
"9915460","9915740"," Flashbacks."
"9929020","9932700"," I bet even the bears that want to get out are getting flashbacks here. "
"9933200","9934660"," They're like, no, don't."
"9934900","9935980"," Don't show me this."
"9944690","9947170"," We know smart money is down here, right?"
"9947510","9948690"," We know that's where they are. "
"9949010","9950970"," We know that they caused the ramp higher."
"9968160","9970340"," We know that previously, right?"
"9970520","9974720"," We had cell signals above, BAM higher, BAM down, BAM up, BAM down."
"9976120","9978560"," Corkscrew winding up, which way do we go?"
"9979120","9985140"," They blasted us up to see if we'd get acceptance to a new level to trade, right?"
"9992130","9998290"," The positive here is that we're trading 420 to 40, 30. "
"10004420","10006900"," New range in the market."
"10013160","10019640"," If bears need to trade us underneath, right?"
"10021460","10025880"," Dip buying here, rip selling here."
"10026940","10035120"," If we get underneath this 410, 460, we're back into our range again, right?"
"10036020","10037600"," Range bound once again. "
"10040240","10041080"," Makes sense."
"10041760","10043440"," Pretty easy for next week, right?"
"10044280","10046400"," We buy dips with stops underneath."
"10047500","10051420"," If we trade underneath, turn into a bear, right?"
"10053120","10057820"," In case we go back to our lower range, man, if we get stuck down there, look at that down"
"10057820","10058160"," there. "
"10060200","10068780"," So we're going to find out if we get acceptance to the upside, 417, 416, 431, 430."
"10069160","10071800"," I don't think we really get to 430."
"10072240","10073760"," I think we sell on 427. "
"10080150","10083090"," See if that shows up right there."
"10088840","10090160"," Big question."
"10090840","10093080"," Do we trade 420 to 430?"
"10093680","10094520"," Do we pull back?"
"10094520","10106160"," If you're a bear on a one hour, you're looking"
"10106160","10107220"," for the cross, right?"
"10107360","10108460"," You can see it right there. "
"10108580","10109620"," This is what you're looking for."
"10109700","10119380"," If you're a bear out there, if you want hourly trend on your side, you're looking for"
"10119380","10121860"," price to get underneath, right?"
"10123160","10126280"," Some kind of capitulation fake out here for the bulls on Monday."
"10127540","10129460"," That's your big bad boy right there. "
"10129540","10130040"," That's your bloodbath."
"10130040","10136400"," Anything under this 415 or so, that's where you get your big bloodbath, like big money to the"
"10136400","10136700"," downside."
"10138020","10141560"," For trend to change to a bearish trend. "
"10149850","10152630"," Here it is on a 15 minute chart right here."
"10153850","10159550"," You can see what bears want to close today below 417, 15."
"10160530","10161610"," You want to get underneath this?"
"10162350","10167750"," Even if there's some kind of like fake out relief on Sunday, and then keep it going to the"
"10167750","10168010"," downside. "
"10168390","10170350"," So this is what the bears are looking for here."
"10171830","10173610"," Bears do not want us."
"10174550","10176530"," Do not want us down here. "
"10177250","10178810"," Excuse me, they don't want us up here."
"10179250","10180570"," They want us down here."
"10181410","10188610"," They want to change trend to go back and trade the less 30 sessions down there. "
"10188610","10190670"," That's what they want from you."
"10198280","10201500"," It's not showing up my five minute chart, but you can see it right here."
"10202120","10204560"," This S1 is of most importance here. "
"10204980","10208260"," This pivot of most importance right here."
"10215320","10217320"," You want to start getting bearish?"
"10224550","10226610"," Start breaking down this right here."
"10226710","10228300"," We start breaking down this right here. "
"10228300","10229560"," Put your bear caps on."
"10229920","10231140"," Put your bear suit on."
"10235110","10236670"," Demand still here. "

"10242630","10244910"," We're not trading for 12 anymore. "
"10245270","10247950"," If this disappears, we get bearish."
"10266820","10267940"," Then you get the point, right?"
"10268080","10269580"," I think that's pretty much it, right?"
"10269580","10271320"," It's pretty much what a bear needs."
"10272280","10277260"," So right in here, bear needs to be like closing. "
"10277560","10280520"," Closing underneath this pivot, closing underneath this hourly trigger."
"10281260","10282260"," They don't have a choice."
"10282580","10283560"," That's really it right here. "
"10285580","10288340"," Like sell side must close underneath this hourly trigger."
"10289000","10294300"," If the clothes underneath this pivot, if they get underneath S1, they have to get their target down"
"10294300","10294540"," here."
"10295460","10298480"," You need Friday to close, man, like down here. "
"10302370","10305490"," To create fear once again that we're going to go back down to 412."
"10316030","10319930"," And I bet you there are bears out there, sell side revenge trade and all of this."
"10320070","10321430"," They're like, we're going to the depths of hell. "
"10322230","10324690"," We're going back down to 412, baby."
"10334910","10337750"," Let me bring this S1 over here for you so you can see it."
"10340410","10345190"," All a bear wants underneath this whole area right here. "
"10346510","10348630"," 418-416-03."
"10366770","10370270"," Yeah, Binky and I were talking last night about the expense."
"10370650","10376510"," Did you guys check to see all the new strikes added in the market?"
"10376990","10379610"," Did you guys see all the SPX buying and selling yesterday?"
"10379610","10383430"," Binky has been keeping us updated in the background. "
"10395370","10400010"," Yeah, I'd like to personally, what I'd like to see, let's address that right now."
"10400990","10411750"," So what I would really like to see is make my"
"10411750","10413590"," own personal opinions and stuff."
"10414470","10417170"," I'd really like to see this trade. "
"10420750","10425690"," See, there's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday."
"10430010","10432590"," Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"10433010","10442950"," I'd really like to see us trade down here and get really fucking bearish on the market. "
"10442950","10451130"," Like, I really want it like, I really want like, I want like real like fear, fear, fear, fear,"
"10451130","10451530"," fear."
"10452470","10455990"," And then of course you get the Wednesday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday."
"10456270","10458790"," You get like max fare on the minutes. "
"10459970","10462410"," And you just, you just trap everybody in."
"10462970","10465370"," Like next four days, one, two, three, four."
"10466370","10468890"," And then you get that face ripper up in here in the Friday. "
"10469470","10472790"," That's my hope for next week."
"10473350","10475050"," We don't start like crashing or anything."
"10475750","10478790"," Like you just start, you just like, you like you get under here, right?"
"10479750","10481510"," You get the squeeze back higher. "
"10482870","10484650"," Bears step back in, right?"
"10485750","10488370"," You know, you get one, maybe one more squeeze."
"10489290","10491670"," Trap all these bears down here and then we get into those minutes."
"10492490","10493370"," Max bearishness. "
"10494030","10498530"," Then you get that rip higher into the close of next week."
"10499330","10506130"," And we actually establish this new, like, so my, my view here is that we establish, we're trade, in"
"10506130","10507650"," my view, we're trading for 20 to 430."
"10508910","10509610"," That's my view. "
"10509810","10510410"," It can change."
"10511210","10516570"," But what I really like to see is this cool off period, three, four, five days, consolidation."
"10517870","10520850"," And then, uh, then we have that face ripper later next week. "
"10521830","10522590"," That's my hope."
"10541170","10542790"," Nice consolidation phase."
"10544830","10546690"," Let's call it three or four days into Wednesday. "
"10547470","10548670"," Consolidate into Wednesday."
"10550050","10554610"," Maybe like one, one, like, I don't know, maybe like one more little dip crash or something on"
"10554610","10557090"," Thursday and then just rip faces off."
"10557250","10558430"," We're back up above 420. "
"10559030","10561750"," Let's make a run for 427 in the first week of June."
"10584790","10589530"," Yeah, I think the, I think the vol is done for today, Joe, but that's my hope is like that"
"10589530","10589810"," trend."
"10590450","10593590"," You know what we'll do is, let me chart it out here so that we have it. "
"10593590","10594570"," So we'll look and see."
"10596490","10599710"," Let's see if we can chart it out for the next week here."
"10600390","10603210"," So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, right?"
"10607000","10609720"," I'll put a dash line up here for you guys. "
"10611080","10611940"," We'll see."
"10620370","10624850"," I can't stand like traditional charting."

"10641830","10645010"," I hate doing this stuff, but like. "
"10647210","10649670"," In my mind, this is what I'm thinking like."
"10650790","10652430"," Just like that into Wednesday."
"10656920","10658320"," Trade out of that range. "
"10661160","10662960"," Maybe you go up for a minute, I guess."
"10663200","10666640"," If you're like really bullish or something and then we get the explosive move."
"10669180","10670240"," Something like that. "
"10670720","10673720"," If I'm wrong and we get above this and we don't sell it."
"10673960","10674780"," If I was a bear."
"10675960","10678620"," If I was sell side, you saw where they sold right?"
"10678780","10679420"," They sold right here. "
"10681240","10682480"," They sold right here."
"10683880","10686720"," They just keep selling this all the way down until next week."
"10688220","10692680"," If it gets more aggressive, if it's like right here and you sell down, we can do that. "
"10694460","10697320"," Now this is where the strong sellers are right here."
"10698340","10699940"," Like your strong bears."
"10700740","10701880"," They're like, I'm short. "
"10703160","10703500"," Right here."
"10704040","10708420"," And I'll re short all day long into Wednesday up here."
"10708640","10709620"," That's what my feeling is. "
"10709760","10712200"," That's what not feeling, but I know they're up there."
"10715770","10717370"," You shall not pass."
"10721600","10722080"," Nope. "
"10737270","10740190"," Yeah, Joe's saying they're starting to drain the premiums out of puts here."
"10741130","10744190"," Yeah, somewhere up in here, like if you're a bear, if you're sell side."
"10744870","10748850"," Even if we don't get here today, you should be looking for this. "
"10750430","10756330"," If you can set yourself a trigger here, you just grab the candles up on."
"10757810","10762290"," Set yourself a line on the candles at 9 a.m. 1040."
"10764490","10764930"," 1110. "
"10765830","10771110"," And, you know, we might go down here, but if you want like the safe and easy short, it's probably"
"10771110","10771690"," right there."
"10774650","10775710"," Maybe a little bit lower."
"10775930","10776370"," You can get more. "
"10776470","10777870"," You can get more aggressive if you want."
"10780810","10784210"," You could lower this like another, let's lower this down just to here."
"10786290","10790570"," And if you tag that at all in the next three days, I'd be like, hell yeah, let's get some"
"10790570","10791310"," shortness going. "

"10803590","10806350"," five grand or 10 grand or 15 grand. "
"10806490","10810490"," They're just like max fucking short on Friday and let it ride."
