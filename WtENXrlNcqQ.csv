"10890","11590"," Check one."
"14340","15280"," Check, check one."
"96840","99720"," Anyone's drivers, any duration?"
"108440","109920"," I think I got it all right now. "
"110260","110620"," Good morning."
"110780","111460"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"112720","114760"," It's going straight to the live stream right now."
"114980","116180"," We're not going to waste too much time here. "
"117800","119020"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"120020","121380"," Let's say good morning this morning."
"121540","123040"," We're usually, we've been busy lately."
"123260","124060"," We'll just say good morning. "
"124460","124780"," Good morning."
"124900","131780"," Good morning, Jeremy, Joshua, Jill, Nutello, Gaudine, Dylan, McQuace, Chaz, Jeremy, Cecilia, rival,"
"131920","136400"," BD, Chaz, Jay Cortina, Binky, Chansu, Johnny Moog's baby."
"136400","138260"," Love that name, by the way. "
"138880","142380"," Morning, Nino, Chan, Ross, indices we trust is here."
"144840","153600"," I don't know how many of you follow me on that captain's alpha, but I left a, I left a"
"153600","154840"," post there this morning."
"155320","161000"," I didn't want to put it publicly on fin twit, on Twitter, on my public handle. "
"162200","164000"," We're seeing some of that right now."
"164480","165840"," We'll look at Tesla real quick."
"165840","169020"," It was a little bit of selling here, and I'm going to explain this. "
"172100","174740"," I'm going to explain this really quick to you."
"177800","178740"," About earnings."
"180700","183740"," And what happens during earnings, the mechanics of earnings. "
"184420","186780"," So we'll spend a very brief moment."
"188040","191780"," I know that sometimes you guys will read or hear stuff about the mechanics of earnings."
"192590","195080"," And you may not have a full understanding of it. "
"195200","197120"," So we'll talk about, this is a Tesla, okay?"
"199800","203860"," And there's a few, there's a mechanically, there's some things that are happening."
"204600","210600"," The dealers price in a market, okay?"
"212300","218060"," The options market and ten seconds for a move, okay?"
"219140","223860"," So leading up to this date here, I'll buy some calls."
"224340","226060"," Someone also, the dealers will buy some puts. "
"226800","231780"," Well, not put specifically, they can do, they can, they can actually take the opposite trade, made"
"231780","232180"," different ways."
"232380","236060"," But basically, let's say I buy a call, they're going to buy a put."
"236580","242780"," If somebody buys two puts, they're going to buy two calls. "
"243080","243440"," That makes sense."
"244820","246120"," That's not actually how it happens."
"246600","251820"," Sometimes those short, those sell against the position or buy with the position. "
"252340","256459"," But this is the, this is like the dumb down version of what I'm trying to explain to you, okay?"
"256700","260740"," Taking the opposite side of a trade as we come into a high vol event."
"261460","267300"," And what that does is it leaves them hedged neutral so that they will make money, believe it or"
"267300","270260"," not, whether we go here or down here."
"271720","278080"," And that's what the market is made here so that you can buy calls and puts to trade to these,"
"278240","278880"," to these numbers. "
"279720","282960"," Okay, that's the basic fundamental idea of what I'm talking about here."
"283460","289120"," So what you should see on an event, as long as, as long as they've priced in most of what's"
"289120","295220"," expected, negative and positive, we should trade to one of these two numbers."
"296340","301840"," Now, sometimes we'll even trade to one of these numbers and then back up to one of these numbers. "
"302720","306880"," You can actually look at Microsoft and we had a similar occurrence."
"307380","308140"," We are Microsoft."
"309000","310900"," We had an implied move on Microsoft. "
"313440","317100"," We traded down to it or up to our implied move, right?"
"317980","322120"," Which is, I think it was 256 or something and then down to it right here."
"324080","325360"," You can see it right here."
"325420","327960"," A little bit more selling down here, but we bounced. "
"328420","333180"," And the point that I'm trying to make is you get the real move afterwards."
"334020","337440"," Okay, you get the real move a few days after one, two and three days later."
"338120","339860"," And my point to you is this is that. "
"340600","346580"," Let me explain the mechanics as this happens on your next day."
"346800","347540"," So we traded up."
"347560","350920"," You can see this kind of reverse Microsoft, right?"
"351620","354380"," So what you'll see here is we make the move up. "
"354380","360800"," We open and you have, let's say you have call holders, okay, right here."
"363460","367480"," And let's say you have, just as an example, let's say you have one million call holders."
"369980","372180"," Okay, you have one million of these guys here. "
"374300","381480"," Well, when we open here, if we don't have any other news, right, anything to bring in three million"
"381480","388430"," call holders immediately, right?"
"389370","393230"," What you have is you're going to have FOMO buyers step in."
"394050","400410"," And that first million, they become bag holders."
"401090","402450"," I guess it's a total of three million. "
"402470","402790"," I'm using it."
"402850","403370"," This isn't correct."
"403610","407510"," So let's say a million call holders immediately off the bell. "
"408030","409950"," These million call holders are looking to sell."
"412110","413510"," You'll get FOMO buyers."
"414190","415430"," This is new call buyers. "
"416710","419870"," And they'll be buying your calls, buying your bags."
"420810","426230"," And if there aren't enough bag holders or bag buyers, the price will start to go down."
"427250","430130"," So if you have less than a million, like that's 750 million. "
"431210","433250"," And that is what's called IV crush."
"433650","433970"," Make sense?"
"434750","438310"," So not as many people are interested as we're up here."
"439530","443790"," So what you're trying to do is what this, I call this sometimes horse trading. "
"446270","452150"," So during this period here, the dealers are trying to match up call sellers with call buyers."
"452590","455430"," If they don't get enough call buyers, we'll start to head down."
"456330","462230"," If we get an explosion of call buyers, we could actually start to rip higher immediately off the"
"462230","462410"," bell. "
"463330","467770"," Sometimes this will take 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes."
"467770","468490"," So we had a good ER."
"470010","475610"," So if we don't have an immediate buying frenzy off the bell, we're going to get some IV crush in"
"475610","475830"," here. "
"476910","482490"," Until people come in and start to buy more calls to make the price of Tesla goes up."
"482610","486130"," Or they reprice the price of calls for the next batch."
"486690","495030"," So my positive deposit on that captain's alpha this morning was that you would wait for a re "
"495030","497330","-pricing of options in here. "
"498030","499530"," The IV crush to take place."
"499890","503930"," And instead of being the first batch of call buyers, you'd be the second batch."
"504570","509710"," Because the first batch of call buyers, let's say I come in this morning and we Tesla opens. "
"510550","512530"," And I'm like, we're going to fucking 200."
"513809","516250"," Let's say I buy those calls for 200 C."
"517270","521010"," And their price didn't, let's say, let's just as an example, say they're five bucks."
"522070","523610"," But not as many people want to buy them. "
"525350","527350"," There's a bunch of us that want to buy them, but not as many, right?"
"527590","528370"," So they're going to reprice."
"528610","531070"," The deal is going to reprice those options at a dollar, let's say."
"532630","533810"," Meanwhile, I bought them at five. "
"534030","535070"," They rolled down to a dollar."
"535310","538290"," Now I'm stuck with a 200 C for a dollar."
"538970","541590"," So I got to get on fin to it and stock to it. "
"541590","545570"," And I got to get on to a news service."
"545570","550330"," If I'm a larger buyer and say, shit, there's a, there's a, we're going to 200."
"551290","552510"," I need you to come in and buy. "
"552770","554890"," So now I'm going to dollar and upside down $4."
"555430","559370"," And now I need the, the second round of call buyers to step in."
"560650","561050"," Right. "
"561290","563230"," So I'm already upside down like four bucks here."
"564410","567030"," And so, so myself, I'm going to be like, oh shit."
"567050","567370"," Okay. "
"567490","568890"," I got a dollar cost average from calls."
"569110","570490"," So I'm going to buy some of the dollar now."
"570490","572130"," Now my DC is three. "
"572690","576410"," And I'm hoping that more buyers step in to drive the price up."
"577250","577650"," Right."
"578090","580870"," And I got, I'm telling them the other only a dollar just buy it. "
"581010","581690"," So they buy it."
"581790","583810"," Now all I'm hoping for now is to get out of three bucks."
"583890","586110"," Makes sense to break even or add again. "
"586770","586990"," Right."
"587030","589910"," So you have a third round, a fourth round of buyers stepping in."
"590730","592990"," Or that I have to convince that we're continuing to go up. "
"593590","595650"," Now as all these mechanics are working out."
"596870","600210"," If you watch an options chain, it's fascinating to watch in here."
"600210","603010"," What happens to the options chain in this time period?"
"603890","609090"," Now, if you're, if you're, if you're a patient bull, what you do is you wait for this to cool"
"609090","609390"," off. "
"609930","614070"," Some bulls that trade, that trades Tesla specifically."
"614870","618450"," Probably think that we're going to trade down."
"618870","624530"," We could possibly trade down to the implied move on the low end, believe it or not. "
"624670","625470"," And still be bullish."
"625710","626490"," We could trade to 133."
"627210","631110"," And then you'd see the actual run take place a day or two from now. "
"632730","638190"," So my point on captain's off this morning was, unless you get some really fast and furious."
"639350","644590"," Uh, exchanging of, of options in the IV stays high."
"645890","649290"," You want to be patient to position yourself. "
"649670","652610"," If your thesis is Tesla's going to continue to go up."
"653770","659010"," Now, the other, uh, comment that I made in that captain's office morning was, don't chase if we, if"
"659010","660310"," we trade higher than 155."
"661270","664070"," You don't want to be short in this either because at some point. "
"664450","671790"," If we get an influx, a second round of, of real true foma buyers, like double triple the number of"
"671790","672070"," buyers."
"673210","675650"," The dealers don't have time to hedge this."
"676930","681430"," They'll what they will, they will wind up becoming buyers instead of taking the opposite side of"
"681430","684190"," the trade back here a couple weeks a month or whatever. "
"684530","689750"," They actually end up coming in here and they'll buy the underlying along with you."
"690530","693210"," So that they don't lose money."
"693790","694790"," They at least are neutral. "
"695270","696430"," If you're coming up here, right?"
"696710","697470"," And you've got all these calls."
"697990","701790"," They have to have those calls to cash them in and pay you."
"701790","705770"," Make sense so that they're actually flipped on what they're supposed to be doing. "
"706190","707650"," And that hasn't happened at this point."
"708150","709910"," So the dealers are all happy right now."
"710350","711310"," Dealers are very happy. "
"711450","712210"," They get to make their money."
"713090","717350"," They're going to reprice options down here and hopefully entice new call buyers to go higher."
"718310","719110"," So that was that point behind. "
"719330","720830"," You don't want to, you don't want to be short in this."
"720970","723710"," If it starts to melt up, you'll get these melt up situations."
"724830","725650"," Too many bulls. "
"725950","728050"," This to me looks just normal."
"728950","729850"," This looks normal."
"730090","731170"," It looks like dealers are happy. "
"732330","733310"," They're horse trading."
"734130","736310"," Call buyers are cashing out, making their money."
"737330","741130"," They're probably on fintuit telling you we're going to 200, right?"
"741370","742510"," And you should buy right now. "
"743050","746510"," The reality is if you're a bull trying to enter this trade, you're just going to chill."
"747330","747990"," You're just going to relax."
"748990","753110"," You're going to watch an options chain and you're going to look, you'll probably be looking at what"
"753110","758190"," a 200 call is or 160 call and just keep your eyes on the reprising of it. "
"758830","765690"," Then you'll actually see like a curve, like a bell curve and the reprising of options."
"767150","770990"," That's an important thing for you if you are a bull here."
"772450","777010"," So myself, for me to take along here, I'm just watching. "
"777270","781290"," I'm just watching, waiting, seeing what's going to happen here on Tesla."
"781610","786710"," Let this horse trading take place, let this air out a little bit and see what happens."
"786710","790730"," Matter of fact, yesterday we talked in stream and in the morning, I talked to some other traders"
"790730","798670"," about Microsoft and I said, this is this morning and I said to some guys in the morning and then"
"798670","800270"," the afternoon or as this was happening. "
"800990","802370"," I was like, I'm very, very bullish here."
"802470","807470"," And then even inside of the live stream, I was like, I'm bullish because of overall what Microsoft"
"807470","808070"," said."
"812040","814820"," And you can see that Microsoft has continued higher at this point. "
"816200","822480"," This is not talking about macro news or oversold or overbought in the market."
"822620","826660"," This is just mechanical functions of the market on an individual ticker level."
"831500","834040"," We're going to go back to spy or on spy right now. "
"836800","840360"," We're going to talk about spy today and into the weekend, into next week."
"841860","844680"," So we've got our pivot here at 39823 on spy."
"846660","847420"," Think tight here. "
"847480","848040"," I got one more thing."
"848120","848540"," I want to show you."
"850560","853180"," And I want you to we talked about this last week. "
"853200","855820"," We're going to rehash it again for you as it coming to the end of the week."
"856380","857680"," So that you are fully."
"859860","861820"," Not forgetting all of our conversations. "
"863660","864680"," And we're going to look at."
"867980","869340"," You're just going to bring this up."
"883170","883750"," Okay. "
"885010","886670"," We're taking a look at the spy here."
"889210","892590"," And we're going to talk about the expected moves in spy."
"892870","892990"," Okay. "
"893090","894430"," We've got January 27th here."
"895070","904210"," We've got an expected move of 0.9%. And then we have the 30th here, 1.1% expected move,"
"904850","907490"," 1.3 expected move on the 31st."
"908190","912890"," But the key here is that after we get into the first, we start to ramp. "
"913370","922670"," We've got 1.8%, 2%, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7, 3.2, and the granddaddy down there, 3.4 "
"922670","923790","% expected move."
"924310","928190"," And you all know that when we trade within an expected move, we can, we will have moments where we"
"928190","930590"," trade outside of that expected range."
"931310","937330"," So if we have an expected move of 3.4% in the month of February, you can probably expect"
"937330","940230"," that we would go to almost 4%. "
"941650","945150"," Outside deviation of the expected move."
"945750","950170"," So we're going to keep that on your plate as we roll into February."
"951490","959070"," I made a post about, can we go higher here or lower here yesterday and that wherever that move is"
"959070","959990"," higher or lower?"
"960710","964330"," You don't have to be messing around in here trying to be like, you know, like I do. "
"964410","965870"," I sometimes have to do these ship posts, right?"
"965870","968910"," I point my finger and I have a baseball bat and I'm like, we're going that way."
"969670","974590"," You know, when you're doing shit like that, it's like fun to ship post that stuff."
"974590","980070"," But the truth is, positionally, you probably have plenty of time above or below to take that"
"980070","980410"," position. "
"980410","983390"," If we're going to go to the moon or we're going to go to the depths of hell."
"985050","989590"," So for the next couple of days, for the next couple of days, and this is, this leads me to"
"989590","991630"," the last conversation, which is the JPM caller."
"992550","994610"," And we're going to talk about that right now as well. "
"995270","1001330"," Now the expected move on the JPM caller, see if I can, see if I can hold on here."
"1001390","1009760"," I'm just thinking, I'm going to download this or then show this in a better, show this in a better"
"1009760","1010500"," way."
"1015400","1017880"," I'm just talking myself into a corner here. "
"1027540","1028619"," Just a second here."
"1032579","1034339"," Let me just bring this up over here."
"1035260","1037000"," So get this JPM caller here. "
"1038599","1042099"," And, you know, it's implicit, it's implicit that we're coming."
"1042319","1044980"," So you can see this is January 3rd ish right in here."
"1046339","1048640"," And we ended up trading this higher, right?"
"1050500","1056240"," And we know that the first contract ends on February 1st right in here. "
"1056840","1059100"," And now this is, this is an old chart, right?"
"1059560","1062200"," We've pretty much traded this into the first."
"1062860","1068780"," Now does that mean that the JPM caller is going to get cashed in and now they're going to monetize"
"1068780","1070800"," and take the short side?"
"1071420","1072300"," I don't know."
"1072540","1078200"," And I don't know if they're going to take the short side of, they might not take the short side,"
"1078220","1078460"," right?"
"1078820","1083900"," They have the chance here, if we start to trade above and out of staying long, right?"
"1084720","1085780"," On this trade. "
"1086040","1086880"," That is a possibility."
"1088540","1093340"," But we want to be paying attention to the end of the month and the first of the month and"
"1093340","1094600"," see if they take that."
"1094860","1099220"," If they take that, uh, and take this short down. "
"1099640","1101880"," And the next question also becomes how deep is it?"
"1102460","1106500"," Let's say, let's say Jamie, let's say Jamie Diamond or someone else from JPM comes out."
"1107180","1109040"," And they say we're short this market."
"1109980","1112080"," And they usually will do an interview on Bloomberg. "
"1113980","1117200"," News or they'll do it on Fox business news."
"1118280","1122300"," And they'll kind of give you an update as to where they are if they're short this market or they'll"
"1122300","1126840"," even sometimes leave it come out and say we're long to like for 30 or something for 40."
"1126980","1129120"," And then they'll actually come out later and say, no, we're short now. "
"1130220","1132280"," And the next question is how deep does this go?"
"1134120","1135820"," Some people are only expecting 320."
"1136760","1138960"," And then as we were as we actually came up over here."
"1139640","1140940"," So when we were back here. "
"1143640","1145040"," When we were back here, right?"
"1145500","1149060"," My first heard social media say, Oh, yeah, we're going to 3000."
"1151080","1153660"," And as I started trading up, I heard, Oh, you know what?"
"1154220","1155580"," 320 is now the target."
"1155740","1156680"," And then as we're coming up here. "
"1157340","1163460"," This past week, I've heard people say, Ah, let's go with 360 360 is now the target."
"1163460","1169260"," If we, if we start selling here, so there's been somewhat of a change in sentiment as to where"
"1169260","1171120"," we're going into a into mid March."
"1171960","1177260"," And normally, if they do hit this, if they hold on a second, if they do hit this, they'll normally. "
"1178960","1181500"," They normally actually hit it almost to a T recently."
"1182620","1184480"," They'll actually like almost tag it."
"1184480","1187820"," And then we'll tag it down here in the 17th and then we'll tag this. "
"1188300","1189800"," This is kind of a crazy move, right?"
"1189800","1192300"," Do we really, are we really going to three zero six zero?"
"1192620","1194040"," That's a huge move down."
"1194220","1195040"," That'll be a bloodbath."
"1195580","1197580"," And then, and then imagine the bounce down here. "
"1198020","1202220"," You'd have like some kind of capitulation movement that are ripped to 360 into the 30th."
"1202900","1204520"," Now do I think we follow this path?"
"1204900","1205560"," I don't know."
"1205620","1209320"," I don't have, I don't have a crystal ball, a magic ball, anything like that. "
"1209760","1211140"," But I did post this chart."
"1211880","1214980"," I think on January 3rd, the first time in a discord."
"1214980","1219860"," And then a few days later, I went back and posted this to a captain's alpha. "
"1221140","1222820"," And so far, we've traded this."
"1222980","1225140"," So far, we've come up here and done our thing."
"1225620","1229520"," So it behooves you for your own due diligence, no matter what anybody is telling you. "
"1230820","1233980"," What's going to happen to at least, at least pay attention to this."
"1234680","1235860"," And also, no."
"1236060","1237100"," I was talking to Joe this morning. "
"1237280","1246340"," I said, I said also know that even if you don't believe this trade, that other people do."
"1246720","1249220"," So let's say you're, let's say you're like, yeah, this is me personally."
"1249400","1250120"," I'm like, yeah, I know it. "
"1250380","1252160"," I know what the levels are for Elliott wave."
"1253260","1257920"," I don't trade to Elliott wave, but I'll assure you that a shit ton of people do."
"1259200","1267000"," A shit ton of people came in here and they sold our downward channel twice already, right?"
"1267880","1268840"," Natural selling point. "
"1269000","1269400"," They did it."
"1269780","1270860"," Natural selling point."
"1271060","1271460"," They did it. "
"1271460","1276780"," And I can assure you that even if we blast up here, that when we hit this four zero, if"
"1276780","1282460"," if we get to four zero three zero by the 31st, that you're going to get people that come in"
"1282460","1285620"," to try to sell this and follow the JPM caller."
"1286200","1290100"," Now, there'll be other people on Fintuit that will be monitoring this."
"1290260","1295520"," So keep your eyes and ears open on Fintuit as we come into the 31st and the 1st. "
"1296320","1301000"," So, you know, whether even if we don't go down, even if your view is we're going up here, you"
"1301000","1307040"," should at least know that people are going to trade to this number if we get there into the 31st"
"1307040","1308100"," and the 1st."
"1310220","1310880"," Makes sense."
"1311120","1312100"," You can you can give me. "
"1312320","1315260"," You can give me every reason in the world why we're not doing this."
"1316060","1318340"," You can tell me wherever you want to tell me."
"1318340","1325320"," You can point me towards charts and fundamentals and whatever you want, but I can assure you that"
"1325320","1331620"," you will get people trading to this pin above. "
"1331880","1332900"," So what are you looking for?"
"1334040","1344010"," We know that the 31st, I think there's a dollar difference in SPX and you've got say the"
"1344010","1344970"," 26th, right?"
"1345170","1348710"," We have 27th here and then we have the 31st and the 1st."
"1349650","1351150"," Sorry, let me just make sure I get this right."
"1352230","1352750"," 30th and 31st. "
"1353190","1353790"," I got this wrong here."
"1356410","1359710"," The 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st."
"1360570","1362690"," And it's somewhere around right up here. "
"1362810","1363650"," You see this right up here?"
"1364570","1371830"," So my expectation is between now and then that we, I think it's 4.03, which is I think 4 "
"1371830","1376850",".02 on a spy, maybe it's a dollar difference, but some kind of a tag above."
"1377890","1380970"," And then some kind of a pin into the 31st down here."
"1382490","1386310"," This would be the earliest, earliest that we get up here is Friday. "
"1386770","1389210"," It could be a possibly be that we don't get there in Friday."
"1389410","1393790"," They pin us in a Friday and then we slam it on Tuesday."
"1394830","1396910"," So just keep your eyes onto this. "
"1398070","1403670"," Know that there's spreads out there, pinning the market up here into the into the 31st at least."
"1404810","1408370"," Do we squeeze the 409, maybe 410, right?"
"1408690","1415770"," Hit that first target for the cup and handle and then come back down and pin to the 31st over"
"1415770","1416310"," here, right?"
"1417130","1417950"," Right in here."
"1418150","1423110"," So this is a possibility as well for a trade into into the third. "
"1423270","1428310"," If you're a bear trying to try to follow this trade, if you find us up here at any point,"
"1430010","1434710"," I am assuming this is what you're looking for is to get up in here and try to call your"
"1434710","1434970"," top."
"1435230","1435970"," It's up here somewhere."
"1438370","1439570"," You get the cup and handle. "
"1439870","1442570"," You don't get the inverse head and shoulders, natural point of selling."
"1443710","1446970"," JPM is supposedly coming in to sell the market there."
"1447250","1452510"," So keep all this mind as we trade these next one, two, three, four, four sessions here. "
"1454980","1458520"," I'll bring up one last thing here and we're going to then move it."
"1458520","1460120"," I have something to do in the background."
"1462680","1466160"," We're going to talk about how bullish we are right now, how not bullish we are. "
"1466860","1468780"," If we're bullish, that kind of stuff."
"1480130","1481190"," Hold on one second."
"1482490","1483230"," I've got a volume. "
"1483450","1485470"," You're looking for volume for us to go up by the way."
"1486270","1488870"," I don't know if you guys know that a volume indicator up."
"1489490","1493110"," I'm looking for buyers for that cup and handle to play itself out. "
"1493110","1494950"," All right."
"1499570","1502670"," Let me clear the move six drawings."
"1505710","1506970"," Move a bunch of crap for you. "
"1509090","1511190"," You want to know kind of buy this dip cap, right?"
"1511330","1512170"," I bet that's what you're doing."
"1512170","1513490"," I bet you're out there right now watching."
"1513650","1515190"," You're like, can I buy this dip or not?"
"1516850","1518610"," I don't know what the fuck is going on. "
"1518970","1520130"," That's what I would be doing right now."
"1520170","1521790"," What is going on right now in this market?"
"1531060","1532600"," Bullish, bullish, bullish."
"1537390","1539010"," Previous high right here, right?"
"1540450","1541810"," What do we want to hold here?"
"1541910","1542230"," Do we know?"
"1543530","1546730"," We want to hold 4.02, 12. "
"1547870","1549670"," We're above the five minute right now."
"1552880","1554720"," See the five minute coming down right here?"
"1555480","1556760"," We have the one minute down below."
"1557060","1559460"," So we're going to look for some consolidation currently right here. "
"1560140","1564240"," We want to see the one minute explode higher on this five minute."
"1564880","1567720"," I do want you to see that there's some flattening here on the hourly."
"1569620","1571100"," So I don't like this being solo. "
"1571240","1574780"," I'd really like to start to see this hourly come up as a trigger."
"1575520","1578760"," Until then, you need to know a few numbers."
"1579020","1579100"," Okay. "
"1579180","1579660"," I want you to know."
"1579900","1582000"," Remember, 399 62."
"1583600","1585540"," And I want you to remember 4.02 12. "
"1585860","1585940"," Okay."
"1586440","1587740"," But this is a key one down here."
"1588780","1589580"," 399 59. "
"1592630","1593950"," So we're going to take a look right here."
"1593950","1595750"," We'll put a little bubble down here."
"1600530","1601490"," 399 52. "
"1606010","1607070"," Right about there."
"1610320","1612440"," That's what bulls want to maintain right here."
"1618470","1621690"," As long as we stay above the blue line, we're bullish, right?"
"1624130","1630550"," Previous high, we're going to test right now, 404.07. I get the wrong lines up here. "
"1636350","1652440"," Go back and retest the previous high in the day, 404.07. We're"
"1652440","1655120"," going to look back at a previous high and see how far back we have to go."
"1655940","1656580"," Hold on a minute."
"1656660","1657140"," We go one month. "
"1660100","1662340"," And see where all this volatility is here."
"1663780","1666420"," See, this is where the sellers came in previously here."
"1669380","1670160"," Sellers came in. "
"1670240","1671740"," I think this was for 14 or something."
"1672460","1675080"," No, maybe it's even farther back over there."
"1675820","1677940"," We've got a 409 98 here. "
"1678000","1678700"," This is our three."
"1679160","1682060"," And then we've got this R2 405 34."
"1682860","1684260"," These are your previous lows. "
"1685700","1687000"," We'll come back on the daily."
"1692910","1697030"," And you can see our one R2 and then way far above 409 98."
"1697550","1699150"," I think we've got one higher at 414. "
"1703220","1703960"," So you're going to expect."
"1704180","1708840"," I'm going to expect here some some melt up and sideways driving and higher and squeezes between"
"1708840","1709760"," each one of these levels."
"1711100","1716320"," So first, the tack right here is going to be the B are getting a new high. "
"1716820","1719260"," On 404.07. Let's see if the bulls can do it."
"1725680","1730600"," If they can't, if they can't get a new high right here, we will come back down and retest 199"
"1730600","1731440"," 50."
"1732640","1735080"," If the bulls give this up, we're going much lower here. "
"1739120","1741880"," I can leave that right there for you."
"1743320","1744740"," And we'll take a look at Tesla next."
"1751540","1752640"," Tesla bullish, baby. "
"1754860","1755920"," Tesla is bullish."
"1755920","1758400"," Tesla bought right at 10 o'clock."
"1759060","1760100"," Like it was nothing. "
"1761380","1763520"," Tesla bought that 10 o'clock and just started going."
"1763940","1765400"," Tesla very bullish right now."
"1765720","1767400"," Trying to retest previous highs as well. "
"1770430","1771530"," Same story for Tesla."
"1773510","1776250"," Tesla starts getting above right here and we're off and running."
"1780390","1781930"," Tesla very bullish right here. "
"1781990","1783650"," Tesla can stay above this blue line."
"1783790","1785770"," This beautiful blue line and green line."
"1788350","1790050"," We will see continuation. "
"1791150","1793190"," This is what a bull is looking for right here."
"1795230","1796810"," We're looking for this right here."
"1797870","1798650"," Come above. "
"1801910","1803350"," Consolidate and start ripping."
"1804910","1807830"," So you got a trade here for Tesla right here."
"1808430","1811250"," Don't enter this trade until the consolidation ends. "
"1811450","1812370"," You pick it up right here."
"1815060","1815480"," Makes sense."
"1818250","1819490"," Trade is good from here to here. "
"1820230","1824570"," And then next trade would be above, let's say, 160 or so."
"1825430","1828990"," Pick the next bullish trade up above 160, 152ish."
"1844230","1846530"," And leave this up for you so you can see it right now. "
"1847850","1848650"," On the inter day."
"1849610","1850850"," And give me just one second here."
"1850910","1853270"," I'm going to have something I'm going to do. "
"1853410","1854950"," I was a little bit late this morning."
"1855090","1858030"," I had an old friend of mine."
"1858030","1867900"," I had a not old but a very long, long, long time. "
"1871230","1872230"," It's one second here."
"1907840","1909160"," Just a second here."
"1936700","1938060"," Just a second here. "
"1945350","1946390"," Come on now."
"1967150","1967870"," All right."
"1968870","1971690"," I had an old friend of mine contact me this morning. "
"1971870","1973710"," I haven't spoken to him in a few months at least."
"1975770","1976710"," He's like, what are you doing?"
"1976710","1978470"," And I'm like, oh, I'm doing a live stream this morning."
"1978630","1982690"," He's like, you want a link to it so you can watch me. "
"1983090","1985230"," This is a friend that I've had for decades."
"1987890","1990010"," And so he's probably going to tune in this morning."
"1995860","1997400"," All right, let's see what you guys are saying here. "
"2006160","2007940"," Caleb's saying it's 11 PM over here."
"2008060","2009380"," Caleb, where are you at right now, brother?"
"2010380","2013960"," 11 PM 11 and Caleb, are you in Southeast Asia?"
"2017720","2019100"," Let's start with Tesla today."
"2020160","2021760"," Are we going to get not 190 on Tesla?"
"2022460","2024080"," Here's another good question we can ask about Tesla. "
"2024080","2027040"," So Chen is asking about Tesla."
"2028940","2036360"," If you want to stay long Tesla, you're looking for to stay on a one hour chart."
"2038810","2039310"," You ready?"
"2040750","2046970"," Make yourself a 27 day moving average of some kind or 21 day moving average as long as you stay"
"2046970","2047949"," above this in an hourly. "
"2049429","2054280"," You're going up on a daily chart."
"2055400","2056900"," Just blue line right here."
"2057040","2058820"," Same same same moving average. "
"2059480","2062120"," As long as you stay above that moving average right there."
"2062260","2066219"," Currently that price is 138 21 on a daily basis."
"2066219","2068400"," You want to stay above 138 21. "
"2070100","2076600"," And on a one hour 150 one, you can actually trade all the way down here to 150 and still"
"2076600","2077639"," be bullish on Tesla."
"2078000","2080580"," If you're looking for a buy in on Tesla, a safe buy in Tesla."
"2081620","2083920"," Right here 150 one currently. "
"2085639","2088659"," That's hourly trend and daily trend on Tesla."
"2089540","2091739"," As long as you stay above those, you're good to go."
"2092320","2093659"," If on a daily trend. "
"2094540","2095800"," You want to watch this right here."
"2096380","2098440"," You have 138 19 right."
"2100260","2103420"," Remember when I showed you the implied move on Tesla over here. "
"2103440","2105640"," This is the bottom range of that implied move."
"2106400","2109640"," Tesla as long as it even if it came all the way down here."
"2111580","2113700"," Let's say you lost the entire day on Tesla. "
"2115720","2120900"," As long as Tesla does not stay under this daily trend down here."
"2121120","2122680"," Let's say it comes down and then goes back up."
"2122820","2123360"," You're good to go. "
"2123820","2125700"," If it comes back down here and rejects."
"2127100","2130320"," That is a fundamental trend change to Tesla."
"2131100","2132180"," You will see new lows. "
"2132940","2139240"," So if you're a Tesla bull, it's all about your risk profile for when you want to long Tesla."
"2140420","2141620"," How long you want to wait?"
"2141800","2142460"," Do you want to chase?"
"2143360","2144360"," Do you want to?"
"2144640","2145740"," Are you super duper bullish?"
"2145980","2148220"," And you're like, well, we went up there, but I was positioned wrong."
"2149040","2149560"," It all matters. "
"2149940","2151440"," It all matters what you think."
"2152560","2154480"," What your taste is for risk."
"2155420","2160360"," Do you don't not care and want to buy the underlying and then just hold the 200 or put a"
"2160360","2161160"," stop loss underneath. "
"2161160","2164860"," That one 38 and that number changes day by day."
"2175220","2175840"," Hey, John."
"2176000","2176340"," How are you?"
"2176780","2177640"," More in satchel. "
"2179620","2181580"," What do you see as a sign that it's time to buy?"
"2181580","2182860"," All right, gave you guys that already."
"2183100","2184420"," Jamie Diamond about to fight in the news."
"2184600","2186680"," Yeah, you know, Jamie Diamond, man. "
"2187020","2191300"," I would have if you guys in your own at home or in your office or whatever."
"2192120","2196740"," I'd be setting an alert for like JP Morgan news articles."
"2197320","2201520"," JP Morgan videos being dropped from Fox Business News. "
"2201520","2203240"," The next next board."
"2203460","2205340"," Four sessions, five sessions."
"2209550","2211170"," Four 10 area and four 15. "
"2211390","2212570"," The bigger areas of resistance."
"2212570","2213950"," I agree with that to chase."
"2216090","2217410"," Up to 41 50. "
"2217550","2219230"," And the April, which seems too long."
"2219650","2219750"," Yeah."
"2220290","2220990"," I agree with that too. "
"2225180","2225880"," Hey, John."
"2226060","2226480"," How are you, brother?"
"2228900","2234700"," This one replaced four minus M and Q's exit for profits today 1207.75. Nice."
"2235740","2236220"," Nice. "
"2236400","2236480"," Nice."
"2236480","2238620"," Open order on 07775s."
"2241500","2244120"," Yeah, I saw that note from Marco, Winky. "
"2244840","2246040"," I'm expecting something more."
"2246260","2246920"," I'm expecting them."
"2247040","2250860"," I'm expecting it to come in right when we hit four or four or six or so. "
"2251340","2252000"," Like more talk."
"2256800","2258680"," GDP home sales, their market market."
"2258860","2259660"," We're going to talk about. "
"2261280","2266500"," We're going to also do a segment this morning on the FOMC rate announcement."
"2269980","2271740"," We'll do that this morning as well."
"2273060","2279360"," There is some whispers in talk out there of decoupling from the Fed rate hikes. "
"2281160","2283360"," It does raise the question of."
"2284100","2291240"," Would the Fed do a surprise hike in knowing that the stock market might blow off."
"2291600","2294440"," We planned rate hikes that we have left. "
"2296160","2297440"," For 2023."
"2298140","2302520"," The other question is that I've seen raised is that we're very close."
"2303340","2307420"," Still being raised that we're very close to a pause or reduction in rates. "
"2308740","2310180"," And what that brings."
"2311620","2316140"," That would either of those could could time into this FOMC meeting, right?"
"2316280","2320440"," If we trade it to that four zero six zero, maybe JPM knows something more than we do."
"2323020","2324520"," So we'll look at that today as well. "
"2330430","2332290"," First day about going to give this back down."
"2332410","2334730"," We'll reiterate Fed's resolve to kill inflation is my take."
"2336330","2337390"," How are you doing today, Troy?"
"2338130","2338810"," Morning, Jason. "
"2339050","2339430"," How are you, man?"
"2342630","2344830"," You have four or four C zero dates for today."
"2347050","2351670"," Let me get a drink some coffee here."
"2359240","2365880"," Steve, where it's asking a cap on a weekly chart, the 50 SMA is sloping down for the first time"
"2365880","2366560"," in a long time. "
"2366700","2367680"," It's crashing into it now."
"2368500","2369680"," How much does this matter to you?"
"2369760","2370360"," It's a great question."
"2371460","2373100"," I want you to also look at the monthly chart. "
"2374600","2378960"," You should be able to see that it's crashing into the weekly monthly chart as well."
"2379640","2383360"," That's the first time since it's the first time in 13 years that that's happened."
"2384320","2390520"," And if you go back historically and look at the results of that of that movement, you'll see that"
"2390520","2394400"," you cannot make a determination if we go up here or down. "
"2394780","2398840"," The only determination you can make is that we're going to make a leg higher or a leg lower."
"2400080","2406720"," So this is not the place for most people to be making long trades in the sense of time."
"2406960","2412080"," So if you're going to put on a three month long or short on the market, you want to wait"
"2412080","2415460"," for the next hundred points before you take a position. "
"2416180","2417640"," It's a great question, Steve."
"2422340","2425840"," Jim Carson is saying a really good video on how this stage of the market."
"2426380","2427420"," I'll check that out. "
"2427420","2428980"," I haven't watched the name of his videos lately."
"2431900","2433640"," Thanks Brad for asking people to like the video."
"2433700","2434640"," Please like the videos. "
"2434940","2435160"," It helps."
"2435960","2438740"," If you follow me on fin Twitter or Twitter, I'll follow you back."
"2439380","2441600"," It takes me a day or two sometimes depending on what I'm doing. "
"2442260","2443920"," But I always like to hear new ideas."
"2444380","2449640"," So if you're out there and you're posting, especially if you're out there, if you're out there and"
"2449640","2454780"," fin Twitter or anything like that and you have your own ideas on the market, I'm always interested"
"2454780","2456980"," in seeing people's takes."
"2456980","2464780"," If you're a person who likes to talk in the comment sections, likes to discuss where we're going in"
"2464780","2470380"," a productive light, hit me up on Twitter because I love to hear conversations people are having. "
"2471080","2475360"," Data people are dropping their own biases and stuff like that."
"2479090","2480510"," All you guys are saying out there."
"2483030","2489550"," What's going on?"
"2489550","2492130"," I was asking me about Tesla. "
"2492530","2493370"," Can it trade above 193?"
"2495510","2498470"," It can, but you need to be sober."
"2498910","2502890"," If you're a Tesla bull, I want you to be sober in the fact that even if we trade to"
"2502890","2505610"," 193, we're still in a downtrend on Tesla."
"2506650","2510470"," That's an important thing to remember. "
"2511470","2514390"," You need to have a bunch of weekly and monthly."
"2516650","2522570"," And daily stuff starts to cluster together to even approach."
"2523110","2526470"," Well, I'm assuming at some point down the road, not assuming I'm hoping. "
"2527350","2530390"," I guess I'm assuming that some day down the road will have that discussion."
"2532150","2535550"," I don't expect we'll break through in that discussion is happening."
"2535730","2539690"," It might take anywhere from one to three months to make that break. "
"2539870","2541230"," But once we do, it'll be explosive."
"2542010","2544290"," It will be an explosive move."
"2547390","2548550"," JPM pump markets. "
"2548550","2549410"," They say it's all bad."
"2551730","2552330"," Yeah."
"2552490","2553810"," So CDS is a big question. "
"2554910","2557770"," The reason why I like CDS is it's traded."
"2558410","2565970"," Very, very consistently with liquidation phases and with accumulation phases."
"2566630","2570230"," If you just check chart, the CDS is the kind of a ticker that. "
"2571970","2575610"," A capitulation phase and accumulation phase that's clear as day on a chart."
"2576750","2578870"," And they're in accumulation as of yesterday."
"2583720","2584180"," Peacore. "
"2585140","2586660"," I haven't looked at it in a little bit."
"2586760","2587780"," Let's take a look at Peacore."
"2593210","2596670"," Have you guys been tracking the stocks that I post on social media?"
"2597570","2601710"," Because they usually post stocks that are being bought by. "
"2603630","2605130"," Being bought by banks."
"2605670","2605970"," Oh, yeah."
"2606130","2606490"," Look at that. "
"2606690","2608110"," Gorgeous moves on Peacore."
"2609430","2610890"," Gorgeous moves on Peacore."
"2612730","2614250"," Outstanding moves on Peacore. "
"2614470","2615070"," Peacore is beautiful."
"2616010","2617130"," Almost a perfect tag, right?"
"2617890","2618530"," The by Peacore."
"2619550","2620930"," Very bullish right now on Peacore, right?"
"2621910","2625850"," Bullish to 59, 49, 62, 99, and 65, 65. "
"2628510","2629330"," Peacore is nice."
"2629610","2629870"," Good job."
"2632530","2634090"," Grubster, we were looking for you yesterday. "
"2634450","2638570"," We were wondering if you were busy with your children today or yesterday."
"2641010","2642970"," Grubster is visiting with family."
"2643190","2645890"," It'd be more nice to see everyone for the moment. "
"2646470","2647210"," Good to see you too, Grubster."
"2647350","2648190"," We were asking about you yesterday."
"2649610","2650310"," Knowledge, baby. "
"2652390","2654570"," Jay Paus piss this fuck right now."
"2655350","2656550"," There are instances."
"2657730","2660050"," So we are trade but below the one minute on. "
"2661090","2663370"," We are trade below the one minute right now on spy."
"2665350","2666650"," Sellers coming in hard and strong."
"2666870","2668690"," They're like, hell, no, you're not getting up here. "
"2670170","2671470"," Sellers are like, nope."
"2672010","2673070"," No, no, we're not squeezing."
"2673770","2679810"," If I had to guess, if I had to guess, man, between now and Friday, we get that like sideways"
"2679810","2681230"," and melt up into Friday. "
"2682510","2685970"," That's what I think is going to happen, but we'll keep tracking it today."
"2688970","2691650"," Bulls need to remember bulls need to hold down here."
"2691730","2693230"," They cannot give us up. "
"2693290","2694350"," The bears will be in charge."
"2697520","2700940"," It's interesting because if Jay Paus stays the course."
"2702860","2704540"," So here's my take on Jay Paus. "
"2704700","2707440"," If Jay Paus stays the course, right?"
"2709080","2711460"," The market will decouple and go up."
"2712260","2719460"," If Jay Paus stays the course and does a 50 BPS rate hike a surprise hike, you're going to see"
"2719460","2722560"," dip in the rip."
"2725160","2726340"," That sounds crazy. "
"2727580","2735460"," I think if you see a pausing of rates or a rate cut, I think you're going to see the"
"2735460","2737280"," market blast down."
"2738340","2740440"," That's my take on Jay Paus right now."
"2743480","2750040"," My only other concern would be if we continued higher, that you would want to sell the minutes at"
"2750040","2753900"," some point, at some natural sell point, some natural oversold point. "
"2756160","2758920"," I'm going to take a look at the background of something else too."
"2759820","2769720"," Now that you bring that up, I'm just going to quickly take a"
"2769720","2771940"," look at the one hour here or the daily here."
"2774560","2776580"," Yeah, still just some rotation today, man. "
"2777600","2778840"," Still doing some rotation."
"2780160","2781440"," You guys want to see what I'm seeing?"
"2782800","2784160"," I'll show you guys what I'm looking at."
"2784260","2791460"," You want to see stuff that you check every day, or that I should check every day and don't always. "
"2795450","2796670"," Just on a daily basis."
"2797450","2801720"," A little bit of weakness in here."
"2801820","2804360"," You see this is back on 23rd. "
"2805520","2807980"," A little bit of rotation going on back here."
"2808800","2811460"," One, two, three, four days, right of rotation going on."
"2812480","2814640"," Haven't seen a steep sell off yet. "
"2814860","2817180"," Haven't seen like big liquidation moment here at all yet."
"2817840","2818960"," Just looks like rotation."
"2820400","2822400"," Nothing is fully fair at the moment. "
"2825020","2828300"," I'm going to get rid of this one and I'll bring up two others."
"2835710","2837450"," This is a price per cent oscillator."
"2838510","2839830"," This is still bullish here, right?"
"2840530","2843410"," So this still looks like rotation not like selling it. "
"2844170","2845250"," PMO is still high."
"2847490","2848930"," PPO is not soft yet."
"2849090","2849430"," You see that?"
"2849590","2849910"," Not soft. "
"2850850","2852970"," I'm going to look at this on a weekly basis as well."
"2853930","2856010"," This is looking bullish on a weekly basis, right?"
"2856930","2858350"," Bullish on a weekly basis."
"2862640","2865040"," Monthly basis, not so bullish, right?"
"2866540","2868400"," Not so bullish on a monthly basis. "
"2869260","2875500"," So in a daily, looks like rotation on a weekly, looks bullish on a monthly."
"2875500","2878740"," Some more space to go down here."
"2880240","2881880"," All right, I'm PPO's PMOs. "
"2882340","2883400"," So what is that telling me?"
"2884760","2893160"," It's telling me this is in a monthly, right?"
"2893820","2896000"," It's telling me I'm looking for some consolidation."
"2897120","2897640"," The move higher."
"2899020","2904060"," And then on a monthly basis to start to expect some kind of a springtime down. "
"2904440","2906760"," So the big question is where is that number above here?"
"2907540","2908140"," Make sense?"
"2909380","2910320"," Where is that number?"
"2910480","2912360"," Do you just nail the cup and handle?"
"2915100","2916380"," Let's go to a daily basis."
"2916760","2918000"," See this accumulation down here?"
"2919040","2921060"," It's not quite high volume yet."
"2921140","2922560"," You're looking for a ramp in volume. "
"2923580","2926400"," Haven't quite seen that yet for that cup and handle to play out."
"2926860","2929020"," I really like to see stuff like this, like a ramp."
"2930460","2932420"," See that 144 million ramp?"
"2932840","2934140"," I want to see this climb here. "
"2935580","2937220"," Next few days I want to see this go up."
"2938200","2939700"," Not quite seeing that yet."
"2952060","2953240"," There we go, right there. "
"2953380","2954840"," Bring that right back there for you."
"2957970","2964070"," I'm going to watch the background and see if the hourly trigger comes into play here."
"2966710","2969190"," See if we're just waiting for that trigger to come up and meet us. "
"2969330","2970790"," We'll see if we're losing momentum or not."
"2974960","2976420"," We're losing some momentum here."
"2979020","2980700"," We're losing a little bit of momentum. "
"2984440","2986340"," We're losing some momentum here."
"2987320","2988340"," Price target down below."
"2991060","2993400"," 399.54 right there. "
"3004750","3005730"," That's what I'm hoping for."
"3007130","3008750"," I'm hoping for a rejection here."
"3008910","3009450"," I want to see this. "
"3011210","3012270"," That's what I want to see."
"3022070","3024850"," Give me a trap, some more buyers in here."
"3030690","3032870"," I want to see what I want to see. "
"3033790","3034810"," What I'm looking for."
"3037070","3038670"," I want to see something like that."
"3041390","3043430"," I want to see something just like this. "
"3043730","3043990"," Bounce."
"3045670","3046730"," And then right there."
"3046930","3047510"," That's what I want to see. "
"3047650","3048170"," Something like that."
"3049090","3050230"," I want to see blood, baby."
"3052050","3053710"," I want to see some blood. "
"3054090","3056870"," I want to see little blood drips down here."
"3056870","3059470"," I want to close this gap down below down here."
"3061270","3064210"," I want to get bulls thinking that they're in charge. "
"3064630","3067030"," One more bloodbath down right here."
"3067610","3069030"," One little pool of blood down here."
"3069970","3072310"," I want this to be the real buy for Friday. "
"3073650","3075470"," I'm going to get a little of that blood down there."
"3077950","3079350"," A little bit of blood as we go on."
"3082470","3083510"," See if that happens. "
"3085930","3086610"," Good morning, Kobe."
"3086830","3087030"," How are you?"
"3089070","3091510"," I bought a fed meat and baby and sell the minutes."
"3092110","3092850"," You know what I do. "
"3099780","3102240"," You make you love boop iron for years, haven't you?"
"3105160","3107060"," Good old market prep, baby."
"3112050","3113170"," How are you, man?"
"3113390","3113690"," Good morning."
"3115790","3118970"," John Haggard, you're saying that T and X and Dix are pushing the day's highs. "
"3120530","3121190"," You're flying."
"3121450","3121770"," Good morning."
"3121910","3122450"," I'm Matthew Ryan. "
"3122590","3122930"," How are you?"
"3125790","3130690"," White House economic advisor Bernstein, the Q4 GDP data shows a credible path to soft landing."
"3133270","3134290"," Back to V-POC."
"3134790","3136130"," Double top Tesla's falling. "
"3138990","3139670"," Morning, Kobe."
"3139970","3140070"," Yep."
"3140330","3141510"," Let's try to see what you guys are saying in here. "
"3142370","3143130"," Look at commodities."
"3143270","3145350"," It's pretty clear that we'll feed into inflation in coming months."
"3145570","3146230"," They're previous over. "
"3147330","3149730"," On a JPM probably mark when they say it's all bad."
"3151490","3153370"," Yeah, I'm flat right now."
"3153610","3156910"," I own some, I meant to respond to somebody on Fintuit today. "
"3157950","3160130"," So I own Tesla stock."
"3161830","3164310"," I don't own any options right now at the moment."
"3164830","3169510"," I did get burned on some Tesla options a week or two ago. "
"3169510","3171750"," Well, right now I'm day trading and looking for a direction."
"3172930","3177350"," So if I'm day trading, I'm looking for a nice bottom to buy to go higher."
"3178970","3184410"," And then what my next next part to so I have a plan right now, what it is is look"
"3184410","3185930"," for a dip to buy every day. "
"3186970","3190050"," I don't care if it takes a day or a week to get to that price target."
"3190950","3194570"," If it takes 30 minutes to get to that price target, I take the money off the table."
"3195890","3201170"," I'm looking for a top on F4060 and SPX. "
"3202310","3203810"," I'm going to get myself with the nerds."
"3205070","3205790"," No offense to nerds."
"3205950","3206290"," I love them. "
"3206570","3210350"," But nerds will be, nerds will be tracking JPM to see if they take the short."
"3211810","3216630"," And then I'm going to be looking for, are they taking the short?"
"3216750","3218950"," Are they coming out publicly and saying we're short?"
"3219670","3221510"," Are they coming out publicly and saying they're going long?"
"3221830","3223130"," Is the market starting to roll over?"
"3224670","3231010"," If it begins to roll over and confirms lower prices, I'll jump in on a short."
"3232070","3236810"," If we don't do that and start to break above, I want to show you this too. "
"3237390","3239390"," I think I can show you this on a larger time frame here."
"3240950","3246250"," So SPX, there's the collar, right?"
"3247230","3248230"," I don't know what the collar is."
"3249530","3251170"," There's the JPM collar right there. "
"3251850","3252410"," Hold on."
"3252650","3253770"," See if I can bring it over here for you."
"3256770","3260090"," Go back to the one day and the daily. "
"3261650","3263290"," There's the JPM collar right here."
"3263810","3264670"," Almost tagged it, right?"
"3266170","3266910"," Here's the dates."
"3267250","3268670"," Here's 131 right here. "
"3270630","3271550"," Almost there, right?"
"3271810","3272590"," Almost right on it."
"3273450","3273930"," You see that?"
"3275970","3277410"," Almost tagged it to a T."
"3278150","3279450"," Almost to a pin strike."
"3279690","3282110"," Look at how close they got there. "
"3283310","3290850"," So my next thing that I'm looking for here is check mark, right?"
"3291570","3292610"," Hit the JPM collar."
"3292850","3293630"," Basically hit it, right?"
"3298820","3300740"," Let's look at the JPM collar here."
"3303120","3304340"," We've tagged the collar. "
"3307480","3309980"," JPM is expecting a move like this."
"3312340","3315440"," They're not expecting like this."
"3315900","3317400"," They're not expecting this to happen. "
"3319380","3321440"," They're expecting more blood."
"3322480","3323540"," Bigger blood, right?"
"3323960","3326220"," Down at that 3060 or 3200."
"3327620","3332200"," So what do I want to see for confirmation?"
"3333740","3335180"," I already know for sure that. "
"3336240","3338000"," Let me get rid of some of this stuff now for you."
"3344810","3346330"," Let me just clear all this out."
"3346550","3347330"," Let's just clear it all out. "
"3348430","3350690"," We've actually gotten there."
"3350930","3353010"," We've actually gotten there at this point, right?"
"3353630","3354510"," You could say we've gotten there."
"3355270","3357110"," Delete all these. "
"3357450","3358950"," We've actually nailed our target."
"3360550","3366630"," So if you're a bull, two range right here."
"3367670","3375310"," At this point, two range right here. "
"3376610","3377590"," I'm a bull, right?"
"3379790","3380490"," There's 410."
"3381470","3384110"," There's the gap at 420 and there's true range right there."
"3386470","3391730"," As a bull, what I'm looking for is to tag this 410, right?"
"3392270","3393630"," I posted this on Fintuit, right?"
"3393730","3396110"," You got 410 above, right?"
"3396250","3399070"," You got the gap at 420, right?"
"3403740","3405240"," You got the big boy 460. "
"3405240","3407200"," This is the inverse head and shoulders measured."
"3411020","3417880"," If you were to measure, if this is an actual inverse head and shoulders, you measure this right"
"3417880","3418100"," here."
"3420200","3421140"," Actually right here. "
"3422100","3423220"," And you put this above."
"3423620","3424520"," That's roughly right there."
"3428230","3433710"," So if JPM doesn't come in and solve this down, so I'm looking for this trend to break, right?"
"3434850","3436170"," And I'll take the short. "
"3437330","3437850"," Here."
"3439010","3439990"," This is where I take the short."
"3441070","3442710"," Trend break, major trend break. "
"3443830","3446050"," If we trade above instead."
"3448290","3449850"," So we trade above and hold this."
"3451450","3452730"," We come back down. "
"3456300","3459540"," If we can hold, let's call it 4,000."
"3460220","3462360"," I'm going to be looking to attack 410."
"3466380","3468480"," 430 or sorry. "
"3468480","3473780"," 420, I mean, and then an attack of 460 by at least end of summer somewhere in here."
"3473940","3479380"," That says May, but probably make this more like this somewhere farther down there."
"3479880","3482520"," So if you're a bear in here, what are you looking for?"
"3484160","3486620"," It's a pretty simple way of looking at it, right?"
"3487100","3493240"," You're going to be looking for a break of this upper trend, right?"
"3494840","3507540"," And you're going to be looking for close below 4,000 somewhere right"
"3507540","3507780"," in there. "
"3507780","3508300"," See that cross?"
"3510120","3515340"," You don't care if it comes up like this and then it comes back down right there as your trade."
"3516940","3517620"," Make sense?"
"3518260","3519360"," Pretty basic chart, right?"
"3519580","3520440"," Not too complicated."
"3520660","3521240"," It doesn't mean much. "
"3522680","3524300"," But I assure you of this."
"3525440","3526660"," I assure you of this."
"3527560","3531140"," You break this shit right here on the way down and you come up here and it comes back down. "
"3531320","3531820"," This doesn't hold."
"3531960","3532580"," You don't get continuation."
"3533380","3536620"," I assure you get something like this and you don't start going back up. "
"3537100","3540580"," You start breaking below and holding like you come down here in eager rejection."
"3541240","3543200"," There is a nice short here for you."
"3544800","3546000"," So what's my positioning?"
"3546680","3547840"," Not a whole hell of a lot right now. "
"3548700","3552760"," Day trading, looking for a high up here to confirm a hold."
"3553120","3553820"," Take this higher."
"3555380","3557280"," I'll take that trade if we hold it so high. "
"3557440","3561040"," This is the trade for the bulls and this is the trade for the bears down here."
"3561400","3562600"," Bear trade, bull trade above."
"3564920","3567340"," Not a whole hell of a lot going on is there. "
"3569440","3571060"," Unspire SPX for me at least."
"3573080","3573720"," Day trading."
"3582110","3583670"," Oh yeah, there's that blood baby. "
"3584570","3585510"," Give me that blood."
"3586250","3587090"," Oh look at that blood."
"3588010","3589750"," Look at that blood baby. "
"3590250","3591010"," Am I getting my blood?"
"3591290","3591890"," Oh yeah."
"3593550","3595270"," Oh yeah, am I getting my blood?"
"3595590","3596870"," Oh yeah."
"3598030","3598710"," Oh. "
"3599830","3600470"," Oh."
"3601690","3603350"," Did I bring it over a little bit over here?"
"3603990","3604350"," Oh yeah."
"3605570","3606910"," Oh blood red. "
"3607630","3608390"," Did I get my blood?"
"3609430","3611170"," Gotta get my blood on."
"3611910","3612650"," Oh yeah."
"3613250","3613350"," Oh. "
"3614450","3615130"," Oh."
"3617860","3618820"," Oh yeah."
"3619400","3619740"," Right there. "
"3621020","3621700"," Oh."
"3622320","3623780"," Do I get my puddle down here?"
"3625420","3627220"," I don't know if I get my puddle."
"3629040","3631460"," He wants to come back up here and talk to the five minutes. "
"3632860","3633980"," Five minutes coming on down."
"3634160","3634800"," It's like, come on down."
"3635220","3635840"," Come on down. "
"3636040","3636800"," Gonna come on down."
"3642430","3643490"," Come on down, baby."
"3644570","3645810"," Come on up here and reject. "
"3646990","3647750"," Come on down."
"3648650","3649730"," You have the green line coming down."
"3649850","3650430"," It's like, don't worry. "
"3650510","3651070"," I'm following up."
"3651810","3652710"," Come on down here."
"3654010","3654670"," It's okay. "
"3654670","3658630"," I got your back over here in case we trade up here."
"3658790","3661090"," And then you down there and get that blood belt down the end down there."
"3661970","3663130"," Oh yeah, baby. "
"3664230","3665230"," Oh yeah."
"3667610","3668610"," Oh yeah."
"3668610","3668810"," Oh yeah. "
"3670910","3672610"," Come on down to blood park."
"3673070","3674530"," Gonna have some fun with mine."
"3676630","3677350"," Do that. "
"3677910","3678290"," Hank Hill."
"3679190","3679690"," Oh."
"3680570","3681070"," Oh. "
"3681070","3681210"," Oh."
"3683370","3684150"," Hey, Bob."
"3684410","3685030"," Get out of the room, Bob. "
"3690450","3691170"," Oh yeah."
"3692330","3692710"," Hold on."
"3692790","3693430"," I set up a trade. "
"3697990","3701210"," Bulls are like, we're going to do the same shit we did yesterday, aren't we?"
"3702510","3704210"," Dealers are like, we're going to trap these bulls."
"3705110","3706630"," They think we're doing the same shit today."
"3708910","3710790"," We're going to trap all these bulls today. "
"3711130","3715130"," A little out of here."
"3715450","3715710"," Okay."
"3715930","3719490"," So January 31st. "
"3720730","3722770"," 404 C's are cheap dollar 57."
"3724410","3728870"," Dirt cheap dollar 57 404 C's is pretty cheap."
"3729690","3731630"," Dealers are saying you're not getting there, bro. "
"3732450","3734650"," That's only that's only 20 points away."
"3735390","3738490"," And they're $1.59. That's pretty suspect, isn't it?"
"3739270","3740250"," Think about that."
"3740570","3741570"," Think about this to yourself. "
"3742550","3746390"," We're trading $3.99 400 right here and two strikes away."
"3746550","3747390"," Oh, I guess it's a little bit higher."
"3748530","3749570"," 404 40 points away. "
"3750450","3754270"," $1.58 8,000 calls on that strike."
"3755350","3755930"," Hmm."
"3757990","3758810"," I wonder why. "
"3760530","3763550"," Let's look at, uh, let's look at spy in the one minute."
"3764610","3765770"," See what's going on here."
"3767910","3769570"," Still got some more blood down here. "
"3769610","3770610"," 399 41."
"3771190","3772790"," A little bit lower."
"3773010","3773850"," We got a little bit more to get down. "
"3774950","3776470"," We're not done right down here."
"3779230","3780090"," Probably not done."
"3781370","3782810"," Look at that blood, baby. "
"3784010","3784930"," Love me some blood."
"3787150","3788710"," Probably do these live streams, right?"
"3789190","3789870"," Don't get trapped."
"3792290","3797130"," Let's look at, uh, let's look at, let's look at momentum. "
"3800010","3800990"," And let's look."
"3801270","3802010"," Let's see a look here."
"3802110","3802870"," What happens down here?"
"3804150","3804830"," See that right there?"
"3806910","3807470"," Oh, yeah. "
"3807890","3808950"," A little bit of a roll down here."
"3809070","3811570"," If you see this momentum rolling over here, don't like seeing that."
"3812170","3813790"," Oh, it's like seeing momentum. "
"3815210","3817350"," Remember we had a cup of cup down here yesterday?"
"3817670","3819990"," A little cup down here just screaming at you."
"3820070","3820470"," Come on down."
"3821050","3822610"," Come on down to bears, use cars. "
"3823650","3824890"," We'll serve you right down here."
"3825350","3826470"," Now, do I think we get down there?"
"3826570","3826930"," I don't know."
"3827150","3829030"," This is a good place though to buy a call. "
"3830610","3833290"," So let's say we have a blast just below it."
"3834930","3835310"," Right?"
"3835650","3839150"," This is a good place to actually buy a call and just have some stops underneath."
"3840490","3843550"," This is also a good place for bears to take, take profit. "
"3844610","3851950"," Uh, it's also a good place for bears to take profit and then reenter the trade as a rejection below"
"3851950","3852170"," here."
"3852350","3858370"," So take profit here, look for the breakthrough and a rejection and then you take the next leg down."
"3858950","3861150"," Uh, next leg down is at 394. "
"3861570","3863670"," So we'll take a look at that part of the trade here in just a second."
"3865190","3867550"," Uh, so you got, we got this one right here, right?"
"3868510","3870310"," Then we've got 394 below it."
"3872130","3875610"," Let me get an exact price for you, 397. "
"3876990","3880410"," Oh man, bears want this so bad they can, they can smell it."
"3881890","3884110"," They can smell it so bad right here."
"3887930","3889650"," Uh, we'll actually do this one yellow. "
"3892050","3893510"," We'll do one more below it."
"3896210","3896690"," Yellow."
"3899410","3900750"," We'll do one more below it. "
"3903830","3904730"," It's going to be red."
"3905090","3908130"," This will be like end of the, end of the, end of the move."
"3908490","3908550"," Okay. "
"3908950","3909290"," Orange."
"3910630","3912910"," Anything below this man, pulls are fucked."
"3913490","3916610"," So, uh, the first one's at 394, 27. "
"3919610","3920050"," 39369."
"3923030","3923650"," Right here."
"3924210","3926990"," And then the last one's at 39261. "
"3928530","3932810"," So this one right here, this is the bulls are no longer in charge line right here."
"3937150","3939590"," Uh, see that bull's no longer in charge."
"3941050","3942110"," Way down there. "
"3944010","3946470"," Uh, we've got this, this is like bull's last hope."
"3947210","3953170"," And I'm looking for a rejection on this blue line and a truer dip by somewhere down here."
"3953170","3954350"," I want to see a dip by down here. "
"3954930","3957390"," So I'm still not long on, uh, spy right now."
"3958710","3961130"," Uh, now if I want now, here's the next thing."
"3962130","3966990"," Uh, if you want to get along and spy like me down below and it doesn't come down below. "
"3967850","3969410"," Uh, you can wait for confirmation."
"3970090","3973270"," And that would be where you see this blue line turn around."
"3975190","3979270"," This green line turn around and then price to follow. "
"3979290","3980770"," You'd want to see something like this."
"3980770","3988970"," And this would be, this would be your trigger to take along with a, with a, um, stop underneath it."
"3989610","3990030"," Okay. "
"3990810","3994030"," If you're trying to, trying to like buy the dip and stuff like that."
"3994610","3998710"," There's two places you're looking above and you're looking for some capitulation down below."
"3999430","4000710"," Right now, I haven't had it quite yet. "
"4000930","4003650"," So I'm just going to hang out here and, and buy my time."
"4014810","4015170"," Yep."
"4020710","4022650"," Yeah, I'm not buying this, uh, dip by right here. "
"4022830","4023890"," I want nothing to do with it."
"4025790","4028250"," You could, you could day trade this if you wanted to."
"4028310","4030870"," You could day trade this right to the blue line or just before it. "
"4031190","4033890"," You could like hold for 10% or something on a zero date."
"4034530","4036230"," Uh, but I don't trust this at all."
"4037050","4038290"," It's not a high probability trade. "
"4047720","4048880"," So we'll wait and see here."
"4052570","4056770"," I'll keep a Tesla on the background here."
"4058910","4061730"," Tesla is trying to regain its one minute right now. "
"4062050","4064990"," Right where it's at 15713 Tesla's trying to regain itself."
"4066290","4072810"," If it cannot regain, if Tesla cannot regain 157.02 right now."
"4073750","4081010"," You are going to see a move down on Tesla to 147.31 or near it. "
"4081770","4084650"," But I am more bullish on Tesla here than I am on spy."
"4088070","4090590"," So we'll, we'll watch Tesla in the background as well."
"4091270","4093310"," See if there's a continuation trade on Tesla. "
"4094750","4097310"," We'll keep your eyes, keep your eyes in the market right now."
"4097990","4102210"," You guys want to go around the, do you guys want to do a trip around the market or just"
"4102210","4103010"," stick with this stuff?"
"4103170","4107490"," I could go through and look at Dixie, HYG, some sub sectors."
"4109130","4109870"," Let me know. "
"4116910","4122330"," Uh, next question here is, uh, James Wallace is asking Captain of plans to buy and hold individual"
"4122330","4124109"," tickers for long term at any point this year."
"4124149","4124410"," Yes."
"4125569","4127930"," So when I'm, so an example would be Tesla. "
"4128990","4133010"," Uh, there was a day where Tesla dipped down to a hundred bucks."
"4133210","4134790"," It dipped down to like a hundred one or something."
"4135729","4141189"," And my own view was that if we were down there, we might as well close the gap at 95. "
"4141710","4143069"," And I was being greedy."
"4144350","4149010"," I wanted to buy one hundred or not one hundred one to buy 95 and we bounced."
"4150729","4152290"," I ended up chasing and buying. "
"4152550","4154510"," I think at one thirty five and change."
"4155270","4160290"," Uh, I'll have to look and see up, look and see what I bought at, but I bought summer at"
"4160290","4161090"," one thirty five and change."
"4161270","4161630"," I bought Tesla. "
"4163609","4166050"," I wish I had bought the one hundred and have been so greedy."
"4166850","4171649"," My trade plan for Tesla is to buy a hundred dollars roughly there."
"4171770","4175090"," Ninety five, sixty four dollars and I think forty six. "
"4176470","4179149"," Uh, and DCA down into that number."
"4179330","4185330"," And the reason for that is, uh, well, I like Tesla and trading Tesla."
"4185630","4186770"," There will always be buyers for Tesla. "
"4186770","4189990"," It's the most traded stock in the stock market."
"4189990","4194350"," Uh, unless something serious happens, something macro."
"4195010","4197050"," Uh, I'm comfortable holding Tesla. "
"4197190","4203910"," If I buy fifteen percent of my allotment for Tesla and then another, you know, twenty five thirty"
"4203910","4207650"," five percent around sixty bucks and then another ten percent or so."
"4208510","4212550"," Um, down around forty six dollars and then have some cash left over."
"4213630","4216650"," In case we have a market collapse or something. "
"4216650","4218950"," Or to start to add that position."
"4219270","4227910"," I'm personally, for me, I'm comfortable owning Tesla around like sixty seventy dollars, but not"
"4227910","4232590"," missing the chance of an upward move in the market where I get left behind."
"4232590","4242090"," Uh, spy is my next buying thing I'm doing as I'm trying to buy a like a hundred hundred shares"
"4242090","4243670"," of spy. "
"4244070","4245930"," I like spy as my second pick."
"4246390","4252730"," And that's because you don't deal as much with a single ticker, right?"
"4252870","4256510"," You're not dealing with an Elon Musk that has something bad happen."
"4256510","4261610"," You're not dealing with Tesla having fraud issues, anything that can come down the pike, right?"
"4262590","4262990"," I don't know. "
"4263110","4264790"," People, there's no mass adoption of EV."
"4265410","4272330"," Uh, what I like about the, the, the spiders that are the spy itself is that they add and delete"
"4272330","4273870"," companies over time."
"4274090","4276010"," It's a, it's a really nice thing to own. "
"4276290","4282490"," So if you own the spy, you can sell like if you own, so if you own Tesla, right?"
"4283110","4286930"," I was having a conversation with someone this morning and I was like, if you own Tesla, like forty"
"4286930","4289050"," sixty bucks somewhere in there."
"4289750","4294170"," Ninety, not ninety, but like if you can get down there and get that four to sixty dollars in Tesla,"
"4294730","4299850"," you can probably sell puts against it outside the money puts against it for a long period of time."
"4300810","4306710"," Talking decades or not decades, let's say like six, six to fifteen years and just constantly make"
"4306710","4307370"," money out of it. "
"4308870","4315630"," Um, if, especially when we're down here in the dumpster spy, kind of a thing, man, where if you own"
"4315630","4318030"," it, eventually it's going up."
"4318530","4322050"," And not only that, you can sell big, that's what people with money do, right?"
"4322250","4325750"," You sell calls and puts against the SP, the SMB 500, that's the truth."
"4326750","4329810"," Now you provide liquidity to the market and you're always making money. "
"4330710","4332510"," Uh, so that's, that should be your ultimate goal."
"4333250","4337670"," Uh, the other thing I'm looking for my own, my own personal, like investing plan."
"4338670","4341850"," Is I know that there's two, or for me, I've got two knowns. "
"4342810","4347270"," I know that we haven't, well, I know that there's a fair chance of us trading sideways and up this"
"4347270","4347490"," year."
"4349030","4352330"," There's an outside chance of us not seeing a bottom for a while."
"4352330","4358170"," That's a price wise, not lower than three forty five to three hundred or three thousand or thirty"
"4358170","4358730"," four fifty. "
"4358850","4363630"," We've already tagged thirty four fifty earlier in the year because they got a decent chance of"
"4363630","4363770"," that."
"4363910","4368730"," So both of those combined, it's the time to start considering putting some risk in the market."
"4369490","4375750"," Uh, but with that being said, I, in my own personal view is that we have not seen a bottom. "
"4376450","4381210"," Uh, now that brings up the question of where is that bottom."
"4382490","4384810"," My own views are that the Fed."
"4386210","4392030"," You guys ever see bears that say the Fed is, uh, scamming or running, you know, like just here,"
"4392070","4397050"," like the Fed is running a scam or the banks are running a scam or the Ponzi scheme. "
"4397750","4403330"," When you hear that, but those things come from moments where the Fed and the banks, uh, try to"
"4403330","4404490"," manufacture the market."
"4405310","4405870"," Right."
"4406050","4408990"," They try to manipulate the market, uh, bottoms too. "
"4409730","4414510"," So I don't know where that last bottom is for risk free investing."
"4415730","4421390"," But for people to assign a price to it, uh, that's where the Ponzi scheme comes in."
"4421390","4429230"," So I do believe that the Fed itself is trying to manufacture some kind of a bottom that's not at"
"4429230","4430250"," like fourteen hundred. "
"4430630","4433010"," It's not at twenty four, twenty six hundred."
"4433010","4439970"," Uh, they're probably trying to manufacture a bottom where we touch on like maybe one day this year"
"4439970","4442030"," next year, even if it's three years from now."
"4443010","4446090"," They'll probably try to manufacture a bottom around three thousand. "
"4446910","4451110"," If we can get the unemployment rate."
"4452570","4456930"," And the inflation rate down the unemployment rate up."
"4456930","4458790"," The Fed to cut rates. "
"4460070","4464170"," And you start to see not this matters as much the inversion yield curve."
"4464710","4470330"," It doesn't, that doesn't, I don't really track it that closely as the end all sale, but those kind"
"4470330","4471290"," of three things happen."
"4471910","4476610"," And I'll really start going back to my old, what I used to do is just buy and hold. "
"4477550","4478930"," Uh, that would feel safe there."
"4479350","4480210"," That's my safety."
"4480570","4483470"," Like you, you should feel comfortable with that if you're a bull. "
"4483470","4488090"," Um, so I would say right now and from now into springtime."
"4488570","4492070"," Uh, tacitly DCAing the market."
"4492510","4496330"," And managing those investments closely. "
"4497470","4502490"," Uh, if you had a, if you had a, like I'm watching this every day, I'm watching this every week,"
"4502590","4503730"," I'm watching this every month."
"4504430","4510530"," Right now we're in the, we're in the, we're in the, uh, watch it."
"4511150","4512350"," Every week phase. "
"4514090","4517610"," We're not in, we're, we're not in a watch it every month phase yet."
"4517870","4521250"," If you're, if you're a, if you're an investment, an investor or a market bull."
"4522050","4524210"," Uh, you are still not out of the woods yet. "
"4524750","4528650"," And you probably won't be for one to three years."
"4529250","4530490"," Uh, somewhere in there."
"4533480","4534260"," This is true. "
"4537950","4542030"," Uh, Superman's asking the question, what if we get so many foreign workers and it keeps the"
"4542030","4543030"," unemployment rate down."
"4543030","4545130"," You know, I wanted to talk about that."
"4545370","4546390"," That's a good question. "
"4546530","4547550"," I haven't spoken about that."
"4547870","4553750"," I want you guys to understand a few things that my perspective on the Fed is that they don't"
"4553750","4554930"," actually fight inflation."
"4555810","4558590"," They don't actually, they don't really have an impact. "
"4559130","4560570"," They have an impact."
"4560870","4566170"," They can make you the investor and the trader have a mindset of where we're going."
"4567330","4570610"," Um, more or less, they're buying time. "
"4572670","4576830"," For inflation acceptance, uh, and for normal business cycles."
"4577870","4582530"," What I need you to understand is when you hear Superman's making a great point, he's saying, what"
"4582530","4585490"," if we get so many foreign workers and it keeps unemployment rate down."
"4585790","4586670"," The truth is. "
"4587670","4592370"," Uh, they can keep rates high and try to manufacture a sideways market."
"4592550","4593630"," That's what Volcker wanted to do."
"4593670","4595870"," That's what we did in the fifties and sixties after the war. "
"4596470","4601710"," After World War two, we kind of made a, we made an environment where everybody had a job and"
"4601710","4602710"," everything went sideways."
"4603710","4608970"," So if you're of that thought process that the Fed is going to move us into that, uh, system."
"4610830","4612210"," I don't think that will last. "
"4612450","4613670"," I think politically, you'd see."
"4615050","4617910"," Politically, you'd see another party take over and say, we're to the moon, right?"
"4620190","4625870"," So I don't think you'll see that ever again, that, that, that, that like golden era of the United"
"4625870","4626290"," States."
"4627390","4632890"," Uh, where we have two decades or so of manufactured, uh, sideways movement in the market where"
"4632890","4634250"," everybody's employed, that kind of stuff. "
"4634670","4638930"," Um, so I'm going against that, but we're just positive."
"4639270","4639970"," What if we have to be workers?"
"4640810","4645410"," You have to understand that businesses still have generally have a business life cycle."
"4645410","4649770"," And this is why I don't think the Fed really has a, has a, has a say in what happens. "
"4650450","4652470"," Um, so just if you own a company, right?"
"4652970","4656550"," You're going to go through growth cycles and restrictive cycles."
"4657610","4663410"," Uh, that's why, that's why I post on Fintuit and say, um, corporate debt has not, has just gone up."
"4663870","4665410"," It's, it's never come down. "
"4666090","4669330"," Even in boom bus cycles, companies will take loans, take on debt."
"4669870","4671050"," They're their own internal cycles."
"4671050","4677890"," So if I own, uh, Captain Jim James, uh, I don't know, uh, rip trash bag company. "
"4678650","4683710"," I'm going to have a growth phase where I'm trying to design, develop design and release,"
"4683710","4687370"," manufacture, uh, trash bags, right?"
"4689650","4694050"," And initially in the market, people are going to be like, wow, this guy's making the newest trash"
"4694050","4694790"," bags out there."
"4694890","4695450"," They're, they're amazing."
"4696030","4697810"," Captain Jim's making brand new trash bags. "
"4697830","4698990"," I've never seen these kinds before."
"4699730","4700770"," Uh, they're amazing, right?"
"4701170","4703910"," And so, uh, people start to buy them, right?"
"4704170","4704950"," Lots of people start to buy them."
"4704970","4706210"," I start to grow as a company. "
"4707170","4709510"," Add workers, add plants, manufacturing."
"4710010","4711430"," Now I have market saturation, right?"
"4711950","4712490"," I look around."
"4713070","4714270"," I'm not making as much profit. "
"4714570","4716310"," I start to cut where I can, right?"
"4717090","4719090"," I might, uh, close a, close a plant."
"4719530","4724210"," I might, uh, cut some of the fat from, uh, the development design manufacturing."
"4724210","4725570"," I squeeze out profit. "
"4726110","4727910"," Then I'm not squeezing out new profit."
"4728170","4729930"," So I'm like, shit, I have to come up with something new, right?"
"4730010","4732270"," A new product for Captain Jim's rip trash bags."
"4733270","4735430"," So there's a natural cycle to a business cycle. "
"4736490","4741630"," Uh, so when you say things like, what if the unemployment rate never, uh, goes up?"
"4742350","4744770"," Even if we get new workers, it's not the workers."
"4745170","4747290"," It's the companies that go through these cycles."
"4747770","4752050"," And even inside of the cycles, you'll have someone like Captain Jim's rip trash bag company. "
"4752050","4754830"," Didn't realize that his trash bags ripped."
"4755990","4759110"," So instead of making a great trash bag, I made a shitty trash bag."
"4759350","4765270"," It might take like four, six, ten years for consumers to find out that I made bad trash bags. "
"4765550","4772430"," And meanwhile, uh, I was snorting cocaine and banging hookers down in, in the Bahamas."
"4772750","4776790"," And I took some of my money from my company and bought some shit goes."
"4777590","4780090"," And then I put some, bought some shit coins along with it, right?"
"4780090","4782830"," I thought I was a badass because I made good, good trash bags. "
"4783290","4785090"," And then I found out that I made horrible trash bags."
"4785850","4789250"," And I also made horrible decisions in investing my money, right?"
"4789550","4791850"," So ten years later, you find out."
"4792610","4797870"," And what happens in that business cycle is I start to lay people off. "
"4798150","4798750"," I go bankrupt."
"4799690","4805310"," And so right now, as a matter of fact, if you listened in to Microsoft and Tesla earning calls, it"
"4805310","4813090"," was fascinating because Elon didn't answer the geek technical questions for the geeks out there."
"4813510","4822370"," He answered the questions for the portfolio manager that wants to give a reason to Bob on Main"
"4822370","4823870"," Street, why he needs to buy Tesla. "
"4825210","4831070"," They want to know, and they also want to know, hey man, did you make it through the boom cycle?"
"4831410","4832250"," What did you do with your money?"
"4832730","4833430"," Did you make money?"
"4833430","4834730"," Microsoft, you made money."
"4834830","4836650"," What did you do with that money you made in that boom cycle?"
"4836890","4837810"," Microsoft's like, oh shit."
"4838830","4839810"," We took all this money. "
"4839870","4842370"," We started laying off all this fat, cutting all this fat out."
"4842790","4844890"," And we're investing 10 billion into AI."
"4844990","4847330"," We think that's the next thing we're moving on to. "
"4847870","4848490"," We're cash rich."
"4848670","4849130"," We're ready to go."
"4849230","4853750"," So it's like you go to the airport checkout or checkpoint and the checkpoint's asking you, did you"
"4853750","4855390"," do the right thing to get on a flight today?"
"4856150","4856190"," Right?"
"4857130","4863230"," And that's what they're doing in this, this season ZRs is they're stopping you at the gate and"
"4863230","4864390"," saying, okay, what did you do?"
"4864650","4865290"," And what are you going to do?"
"4865430","4868990"," And what about the impending possible recession?"
"4869470","4870550"," Can you handle that?"
"4871950","4876670"," And so we're in this normal part of the business cycle where we're checking these companies. "
"4877390","4879470"," We're like, okay, Microsoft, you can get through."
"4880670","4882870"," Purple pillow guy, get the fuck out of here."
"4882970","4883670"," You're out of here, man. "
"4884210","4884590"," You know what I mean?"
"4884910","4885270"," Peton."
"4886410","4886810"," Peloton."
"4887590","4889990"," You made all this money during lockdowns. "
"4889990","4893750"," Did you design a bicycle for outside for riding bikes outside?"
"4894290","4895070"," They're like, oh, fuck."
"4895210","4895910"," No, I didn't do that."
"4896150","4900330"," I fucking we're improving that, but that indoor bicycle and people are like, what do you mean?"
"4900350","4900950"," You're doing that. "
"4901890","4902890"," We're opening up."
"4903170","4904670"," How do you not have an outside bike?"
"4905730","4910110"," How do you not transfer what you did inside the house and take it outside?"
"4910850","4911430"," Does that make sense?"
"4912850","4917250"," So right now we're in this part of the business cycle where the fed is like, okay."
"4917250","4919970"," So we know we know we have possible and recession coming. "
"4920190","4923310"," We know that we're at the end of a growth cycle and businesses."
"4923810","4928110"," We're going to come out with all these rate hikes and we're going to do QT and all this other"
"4928110","4928410"," bullshit."
"4928710","4929530"," We're going to threaten the market. "
"4930850","4931270"," Right?"
"4931630","4932570"," We have inflation raging."
"4934570","4937890"," We need we need some time so that people accept eggs at $10."
"4939010","4943190"," We need time because these companies, all this is interconnected. "
"4943570","4946470"," Then you get companies that are like, okay, we make eggs."
"4947750","4948330"," Hire me."
"4948470","4948950"," Hire me. "
"4949250","4953710"," An engineer to project how much profit we're going to make for the next 10 years."
"4953710","4954010"," Right?"
"4954610","4956590"," The engineer sits down and the guy's like, okay, here."
"4956790","4958210"," This is a kept Jim's egg company. "
"4958890","4963690"," And the guy says, okay, so right now they're right now people are paying $2 for a dozen of eggs."
"4963950","4965170"," I'm like, okay, that's cool."
"4965250","4965550"," Two bucks. "
"4966910","4970950"," And the engineer tells you, I want you to know something else though, because you sell eggs, you"
"4970950","4974770"," cannot raise the prices probably until the next catastrophic event happens."
"4974770","4978370"," The next shortage for any reason we can make up."
"4978850","4980310"," Can you handle that for 10 years?"
"4980530","4981450"," Captain Jim's egg company. "
"4981590","4982930"," I'm like, oh, yeah, I can do that."
"4983370","4983630"," Right?"
"4983770","4984870"," So I sell eggs for two bucks."
"4986050","4987810"," A year passes, three year passes. "
"4988110","4988810"," Nothing bad happens."
"4989070","4989770"," Eight year passes."
"4990770","4991310"," We have a whiff. "
"4992090","4994250"," Or we have the COVID lockdowns, right?"
"4994530","4994770"," Shortages."
"4996130","4996570"," Right?"
"4996950","4997290"," Oh shit."
"4997350","4999390"," I have a chance to raise the prices of eggs now. "
"5000330","5002730"," And then there's this bullshit at bird flu."
"5003370","5005370"," Like we lose like 1% of the fuck."
"5005570","5005970"," Doesn't matter. "
"5006490","5011530"," This is our chance in like 10 years of past for me to say, fuck that."
"5011670","5012730"," I'm going to raise the prices of eggs."
"5013370","5014470"," Well, how are you going to raise them?"
"5014670","5018390"," Well, you know, you as Bob on Main Streets, like $3 is plenty. "
"5018930","5023250"," And me being the guy that is the egg producer, I'm like, nah, fuck that shit."
"5023950","5025430"," I'm going to raise eggs to $8."
"5025990","5028110"," I want to raise them to 10, but I'll raise them to $8. "
"5029510","5030410"," And I don't care."
"5030410","5035550"," I'm not bringing the price down and I'm staying at $8 because I know these assholes for the next"
"5035550","5039570"," five or 10 years are going to hold me to this price."
"5041210","5048410"," So they're actually the egg company, believe it or not, is forecasting the cheapness of money in 10"
"5048410","5048790"," years. "
"5049230","5051670"," They don't actually believe the Fed."
"5052910","5057370"," They know that inflation will persist in five or 10 years."
"5057370","5063610"," They've got smart people in the background saying to them, look, Jim, I know that you know that I"
"5063610","5068950"," know that you know that you think inflation is going to come down that they're feeding this"
"5068950","5069790"," bullshit to you. "
"5069790","5073750"," But I promise you, Captain Jim, you ain't going to get a chance in five or 10 years to raise"
"5073750","5074430"," the price of eggs."
"5074830","5077310"," You hold $8 and sometimes you put them on sale."
"5077510","5078850"," Sometimes you'll be like, yeah, they're four. "
"5079070","5081650"," Yeah, they're six today, but they're eight fucking dollars."
"5082430","5084610"," Or else you won't be in business in eight or 10 years."
"5084790","5085750"," Does that make sense, Captain Jim?"
"5086190","5089770"," Because you're going to get left behind as people actually accept this. "
"5089930","5095450"," And so you look like a shithead owning Captain Jim's egg company, but you have to do that."
"5095890","5096450"," Does that make sense?"
"5100190","5101270"," Does that make sense?"
"5102630","5104890"," Now I'm talking about, you guys have to understand."
"5105010","5105790"," We're talking about two different things. "
"5106070","5108150"," I'm talking about two things."
"5109090","5110610"," Inflation comes down, right?"
"5111310","5112150"," Watch my fingers here."
"5112150","5116770"," Inflation comes down on some items, but it doesn't on others. "
"5118290","5125670"," And most of the items where inflation does not come down on are items, not always, but mostly are"
"5125670","5127750"," items that are like staples."
"5128470","5129130"," Does that make sense?"
"5129370","5131830"," Like staples, the price usually does not come down."
"5132290","5134650"," They usually only have oil companies. "
"5135090","5138890"," You ask anyone in an oil company, they're like, gas is two bucks."
"5138890","5142210"," I know it's coming down to two bucks, 10 years from now."
"5142650","5145410"," So in this price cycle, I have to go up and jack these prices up. "
"5146210","5146790"," Does that make sense?"
"5147550","5150790"," So some of these prices will come down and some of these prices don't."
"5150870","5155510"," If any of you are 40 or 50 years old, you can look at some products and you know that"
"5155510","5159050"," at one time you could buy ground beef or like 33 cents a pound."
"5159570","5160850"," You could buy it at dollar a pound. "
"5161310","5162810"," You could buy it at three dollars a pound."
"5162970","5164230"," You could buy it at four dollars a pound."
"5164490","5167490"," Now you're at five dollars, six dollars a pound on ground beef. "
"5167490","5169490"," Some items, they never come down."
"5169670","5173050"," So there's a blend and a mix for what companies you're talking about."
"5173170","5177670"," You've got one sector of companies where prices will come down over time like a TV. "
"5178350","5179710"," Tech will come down over time."
"5180090","5182910"," You have another one that goes through cycles that's like oil and gas."
"5183630","5189390"," Then you have these like base staples that get produced and they never actually ever come down. "
"5189870","5195810"," So in this basket of products that you consume in life, you'll see some inflation come down, some"
"5195810","5198430"," not, and you'll see some that just need acceptance."
"5199030","5202870"," And that's where the Fed steps in and says, we're fighting inflation."
"5204330","5210250"," Meanwhile, I promise you, if you're a young guy, if you're like 20 or 30, I assure you that you"
"5210250","5214070"," will see, you'll never see exit a dollar and two dollars again in your lifetime. "
"5214550","5215330"," I guarantee it."
"5215970","5217790"," You'll never ever see it in your lifetime again."
"5217890","5218150"," It's gone. "
"5226650","5230330"," I assure you, there's some, if you're an older person in this stream right now, if you're in your"
"5230330","5233550"," 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, you can come right in this stream and tell them in chat."
"5234050","5236730"," There are some items that once they go up, they just don't ever come down."
"5236870","5237470"," That's just it. "
"5239350","5240970"," And so they push that price on you."
"5241050","5245990"," Maybe we might not say eight dollars, exactly an eggs, but we'll come back down, but not to one"
"5245990","5246310"," dollar."
"5248250","5249390"," You just won't see it. "
"5249510","5253330"," It's part of the, it's part of the, you got, I can show you an inflationary chart."
"5253550","5254010"," You want to see it?"
"5254510","5256270"," You want to see real inflation over the years?"
"5256470","5257130"," I can show it to you."
"5258030","5259670"," I can show you what a dollar bought you. "
"5259930","5264090"," I can show you what a dollar bought you back in the 50s and what a dollar buys you today."
"5265750","5268130"," I can show you, I can show you inflation acceptance."
"5269950","5270890"," I'm not making shit up. "
"5275000","5276320"," It's sweet, sweet orange juice."
"5277820","5280620"," Yeah, absolutely."
"5281300","5285560"," I have some fucking looly. "
"5286040","5289240"," So, not to the mean likes tech doesn't come down."
"5289380","5292200"," Like your TVs are cheap when they used to be by a hundred inch TV today."
"5292380","5294220"," It used to cost 30,000 dollars. "
"5295120","5298860"," I agree that that stuff comes down, but there's some stuff that's not, you want to keep your eyes"
"5298860","5299420"," on that stuff."
"5299920","5304160"," Like when you look at stuff like ground beef, look at stuff like sugar or flour."
"5305240","5311760"," When you see a price increase there, you know that we're moving into a phase where the Fed wants"
"5311760","5314700"," you as the consumer to accept some higher inflation. "
"5360690","5361810"," Hang tight for a second."
"5367620","5369300"," I'll go over some news with you real quick."
"5370020","5371920"," You asked about Senate Majority Leader Schumer. "
"5372600","5377520"," Few issues require more bipartisanship, more cooperation and more serious mindedness than"
"5377520","5380520"," protecting the full faith in credit of the United States."
"5381240","5385680"," We've never failed to pay our debts on time and the debt ceiling has consistently been a bipartisan"
"5385680","5387240"," bipartisan endeavor."
"5388140","5390500"," Do any of you think out there that we have to worry about?"
"5390640","5393780"," I'm going to ask this question inside of the stream. "
"5401080","5403920"," I'm going to do a poll here on inflation."
"5405440","5408460"," Not inflation on the debt ceiling."
"5411960","5413300"," Be concerned. "
"5415420","5416400"," Hang tight."
"5416500","5417320"," I got a question for you."
"5425590","5427990"," Does the debt ceiling matter now?"
"5431720","5434980"," Debt ceiling matter now?"
"5438320","5439360"," Want to say it?"
"5440580","5441260"," Question mark. "
"5443220","5443700"," June."
"5455360","5456880"," Don't ask you guys a question right here."
"5458740","5462440"," Does the debt ceiling matter now in June or what the fuck is the debt ceiling?"
"5462920","5466500"," Let me know if you care or don't care about the debt ceiling. "
"5470680","5472580"," Let's scroll through some more news this morning."

"5686610","5687370"," Should have bought that bottom."
"5687770","5688710"," Should have bought that bottom. "
"5688870","5689210"," Does that make sense?"
"5690590","5692530"," Then you get some market clap bears."
"5692770","5694450"," They're like hell no, we're going way down here."
"5696670","5697030"," Sure. "
"5697310","5697890"," We can go down there."
"5698510","5699170"," But even if we do."
"5700050","5701270"," Well, you know we do. "
"5702290","5703270"," We're not there yet, right?"
"5703430","5704590"," We haven't seen any signs that yet."
"5704910","5711490"," And we know this markets just imagine if you're like just imagine if you're a collapse if you're a"
"5711490","5712630"," person that talks about collapse."
"5718260","5720880"," The likelihood of you getting left behind here. "
"5723820","5728140"," To be like the deepest they're expecting, but it's covered two to fifty nine to fifty nine."

"5740780","5743300"," Like a fifty five percent chance of happening."
"5744420","5744900"," Right?"
"5745280","5748860"," So if you're a bull, same thing if you're a boy is you could flip this chart upside down, right?"
"5749560","5751760"," Fifty five percent of that chance that happening, right?"
"5754560","5755280"," Down here. "
"5757140","5760220"," The thirty five percent chance that happening, right?"
"5762040","5763480"," You know what this is down here?"
"5764340","5766300"," It's like fifteen percent or less."
"5767980","5769580"," Fifteen percent chance that happening."
"5770920","5771860"," You see what I'm saying?"
"5772780","5774520"," So the lower we go down here. "
"5775500","5777840"," The lower the chance of us going this low."
"5778140","5778720"," That makes sense."
"5779160","5782020"," So you get some guy out there and he's like, we're going to fourteen hundred. "
"5782340","5786840"," Earlier had done as the E commission proposes a price cap from Russian premium oil products or"
"5786840","5789020"," diesel of one hundred dollars per barrel."
"5789260","5792500"," Also a forty five dollars per barrel on discounted oil products."
"5792900","5797220"," So again, we did hear this come from sources earlier starting people familiar with the matter. "
"5797700","5799900"," We're just seeing confirmation from EU officials now."
"5800640","5802200"," I'm like, yeah, that makes sense down there."
"5803800","5805580"," I'm like, this makes a little bit of sense. "
"5805800","5806620"," We can dip down there."
"5807580","5808160"," Makes sense?"
"5808920","5809520"," See that over here?"
"5809620","5810400"," Pre-lose?"
"5811040","5812700"," Maybe a little bit of sense down here."
"5812800","5814100"," See how close we already got to it?"
"5815000","5816900"," We already got to the lows over here. "
"5818120","5822160"," You get the fed there like we want to see more, we want to see more of this, right?"
"5823660","5824280"," Do you know what I'm saying?"
"5824960","5828420"," And then you're like, well, we're actually going down here and I'm like, yeah, we might."
"5829480","5831880"," But I'd rather trade that when we get there."
"5832220","5839100"," I'd rather be, I'd rather be, I'd rather be trading down here. "
"5840180","5847900"," And having like Bank of America crashing or closing and the federal government saying, oh man,"
"5848000","5849080"," we're in World War three or something."
"5849360","5852280"," I want to have that news to back up this trade down here."
"5852820","5853180"," Makes sense?"
"5853960","5855460"," We aren't seeing that news yet, are we?"
"5857780","5859860"," So I would trade what's in front of you. "
"5861140","5862500"," I would trade this."
"5865260","5869700"," And even if we crashed here, I would be looking for a dip bite out here unless there's some other"
"5869700","5872160"," material event."
"5873640","5875020"," You're looking for something like that. "
"5875820","5876280"," Makes sense?"
"5876440","5877340"," Your chances down here."
"5877440","5881720"," Just to be in like standing here with a baseball bat and a finger pointing and going for bloodbath"
"5881720","5882400"," and it down here."
"5882900","5883980"," I don't believe that you have money. "
"5884700","5886640"," I don't believe you have skin in the game on that trade."
"5887380","5887860"," Maybe you do."
"5887860","5891960"," Maybe you've got like 10 grand on that trade, but you're fucking long or trading this. "
"5893340","5898140"," You're trading this in and out right now with, you know, 200 grand or something."
"5899360","5901660"," I don't think you're actually, I don't think I don't believe you."
"5901740","5902240"," I'll say that. "
"5902500","5903620"," I don't fucking believe you."
"5905840","5907140"," I think you're a liar."
"5910520","5912380"," I think you're a sub seller. "
"5912380","5918980"," I think you're out there living in Puerto Rico and you're right once a day."
"5920400","5921360"," You know what I mean?"
"5922600","5929240"," I think you care more about selling a newsletter or collecting fees than you do about being a"
"5929240","5932060"," retail trader or investor trying to manage your own money."
"5933540","5938040"," That's what I think. "
"5939720","5940800"," Okay, so I'll vote."
"5941180","5942680"," Do I think the debt ceiling matters?"
"5942980","5945120"," I think it matters in June."
"5947220","5948040"," That's what I think. "
"5948820","5950220"," I think it matters in June."
"5952840","5953740"," See what you guys think."
"5956280","5962240"," The debt ceiling matters to most of our traders and investors in June, 46%. "
"5962240","5964000"," We have very smart people."
"5965400","5966160"," Good job."
"5966880","5968960"," You're going to buy some cheap zero dates, right?"
"5969340","5970600"," You could actually probably take that. "
"5970840","5972080"," You want a cool part about that trade?"
"5972760","5982140"," I bet if you've made yourself a Google alert in May, you could probably collect the vol by selling"
"5982140","5984460"," puts in June for that trade and then closing it."
"5985780","5989580"," There'll probably be some good vol on the put side for the debt ceiling."
"5991240","5993720"," 34% said what the fuck is the debt ceiling?"
"5996320","6001640"," It's one of the biggest scams used by the financial community to create volatility for us. "
"6002520","6003760"," They love to talk about it."
"6003920","6005760"," It only really matters at every decade or so."
"6008460","6009340"," Now, 19%. "
"6009340","6013080"," So if you clicked now, the debt ceiling matters right now."
"6013220","6015240"," Let me know in the chat why you think it matters right now."
"6015320","6016760"," I'm interested to hear your opinion on that. "
"6017360","6019280"," Because maybe I'm missing something."
"6026580","6028540"," Moog is saying that debt ceiling will matter in May."
"6028740","6032680"," Yeah, I think that you can actually sell vol in May. "
"6033220","6034060"," I agree with that."
"6034240","6036140"," I think may you can start selling some vol."
"6041630","6043870"," Missy Jimberry is saying, here's what you don't understand. "
"6044030","6047590"," If you have a lot of debt and you have a high inflation, your debt is actually worthless."
"6048430","6049330"," It's called inflation tax."
"6049510","6050630"," I agree with that too, Jimmy. "
"6053560","6057080"," The debt ceiling is what makes your dollar worth or cents."
"6058220","6059420"," I agree with that too."
"6059520","6059860"," That's funny. "
"6060340","6061200"," Like how you said it."
"6064470","6065670"," Oh, did he really die?"
"6065830","6067870"," Did publishers that is debt ceiling report?"
"6068470","6068970"," I want to read that."
"6073740","6075320"," It mostly is where we roam. "
"6075740","6076340"," It does matter."
"6077880","6078740"," It does matter."
"6078860","6079800"," It does matter some years. "
"6081780","6082420"," It does."
"6082440","6083540"," It does matter some years."
"6083900","6086180"," I agree with that, but it does. "
"6086180","6091460"," It's often used for content for the financial market for a few months."
"6093260","6093900"," I got to read that."
"6094320","6095260"," Dalio post on LinkedIn. "
"6101190","6102170"," Thanks for the heads up on that."
"6107710","6109530"," Yeah, that's the only thing with the political football."
"6114650","6115950"," Yeah, you need to factor inflation. "
"6116150","6117530"," Any hypothesis who will not do it."
"6117570","6117790"," I agreed."
"6121270","6122590"," You guys want to see something cool?"
"6126250","6129390"," The Fed debt. "
"6129970","6130950"," You want to see what's cool?"
"6131590","6132830"," You got to see what's cool."
"6136920","6140460"," Let me see if I can show you guys something cool."
"6155950","6158750"," Yeah, still no trade here in Spy. "
"6159050","6168340"," Just show you something really cool."
"6172540","6173420"," Here we go."
"6178940","6179540"," Okay. "
"6180520","6181400"," What do we have here?"
"6185420","6186500"," Oh, look at that."
"6187520","6191480"," All non-financial sector debt and trillions of dollars."
"6191840","6195840"," Debt includes debt securities, commercial paper treasury securities, agency and GSE backed"
"6195840","6199920"," securities, municipal securities, corporate and foreign bonds and loans, the pository and"
"6199920","6203660"," institutional loans, other loans and advances, mortgages and consumer credit. "
"6204520","6205440"," See back down here?"
"6206700","6208060"," This is a good day."
"6208620","6210780"," This is where we had high rates."
"6212040","6213720"," We tried to tamper down growth. "
"6214600","6216700"," We forced companies into keeping people employed."
"6217060","6217580"," We built America."
"6218340","6218720"," That kind of stuff. "
"6218920","6219980"," You see that expansion over here?"
"6220800","6222160"," I mean, just look at how disgusting that is."
"6224640","6227920"," Businesses, household, federal, state and local."
"6228760","6231180"," This mind you, mind you. "
"6232260","6234700"," This is all along while we had crashes, right?"
"6236040","6238220"," We had eight and armor in 1987, right?"
"6238800","6243100"," I think we had a 2000- we had something over here, 2000- we had something, 2007- 2008."
"6243560","6244720"," All along, what happened?"
"6245320","6247100"," All along, what happened over here?"
"6248380","6248520"," Right?"
"6248820","6250180"," We just kept accumulating debt."
"6250900","6251880"," Didn't matter, did it?"
"6252520","6257200"," When people tell you that they have, when the Fed tells you that we have tightening cycles, the"
"6257200","6258900"," error of cheap money is over. "
"6259340","6260100"," That's what they tell you, right?"
"6260420","6261760"," Error of cheap money is over."
"6263520","6264480"," Wasn't here, was it?"
"6265200","6268280"," How about when we have economic or business cycle downturns?"
"6269520","6270400"," Wasn't here, was it?"
"6271080","6271580"," Was it here?"
"6272380","6272920"," I knew what they were doing."
"6273240","6273960"," You know what companies are doing?"
"6274720","6277680"," Taking hand over fist debt on. "
"6279300","6282160"," Hand over fist debt."
"6284540","6285560"," Hand over fist."
"6290680","6293240"," You know why they say that shit to you?"
"6293400","6295220"," It's because you're just like Bob on Main Street. "
"6295540","6296160"," That's what you are."
"6297020","6298780"," It's basically just lie to you."
"6299620","6303220"," You know where money doesn't get cheap for you?"
"6304600","6306360"," Money doesn't get cheap for you. "
"6306920","6308760"," Companies don't care if money's not cheap."
"6309300","6310860"," They don't care if it's cheap and it's expensive."
"6311240","6311580"," They don't care. "
"6311700","6312240"," You does care?"
"6313180","6314340"," Bob on Main Street."
"6314620","6317740"," Bob's out there like can't afford the $8 eggs."
"6318580","6322200"," His credit card fucking credit card rates went through the roof. "
"6323580","6328160"," Bob's, Bob's drinking the Kool-Aid when I bought an F-350 for $160,000."
"6329040","6330560"," Check out a 20-year note on it."
"6332300","6335420"," Bob's wife is like, oh it's okay honey if we're buying the top of the market. "
"6335880","6339680"," Our neighbors will still be here when they start buying with high rates on their houses."
"6340760","6342300"," We're locking in zero percent."
"6342640","6343080"," It's gonna be great. "
"6343320","6348940"," Then they realize five years later that their neighborhood's empty and that they'll never gain back"
"6348940","6349620"," what they bought at."
"6349720","6352280"," So they just sell or go back up and say fuck it."
"6353300","6354960"," But companies don't go through that. "
"6355980","6357920"," Companies can give a fine shit about that."
"6360840","6362580"," Yeah Bob doesn't get a bailout."
"6368280","6373840"," The trough is always open for certain people. "
"6376180","6381780"," So yes I do agree with your statements that we might crash one day."
"6382400","6388520"," I don't agree with the fact that in the US and our system, they will always make a market and"
"6388520","6391320"," they will always consume with greed."
"6391720","6392520"," It's just never ending. "
"6392700","6394340"," It's the filthiest thing in the entire world."
"6395240","6396360"," It really is."
"6397820","6399820"," That's where you get the Ponzi scheme statements. "
"6403690","6406110"," Yeah I heard about the G-Wagons nerd act."
"6406270","6407550"," Our ex I heard about that shit."
"6410510","6413010"," Yeah it's a good book. "
"6413010","6416690"," The creature from Jekyll Island and Central Bagging 101 is a great book."
"6418970","6419410"," Yep."
"6422570","6431760"," Yeah I was talking to my close friend of mine about how they try to steal the money so when"
"6431760","6440440"," cheap money goes away for you, I don't know what you guys own out there but I've been ducking and"
"6440440","6443580"," weaving trying to keep the money that I took out of the market. "
"6444180","6446580"," I'm like stuck in weaving."
"6447500","6448300"," Keep profit."
"6448500","6449000"," Keep profit. "
"6449900","6451440"," And I just got a letter yesterday."
"6451520","6455760"," I got a fucking letter in the mail yesterday that my taxes went up on a property."
"6456420","6457980"," I should go get it and read it to you. "
"6458440","6460020"," And they're like this is not a tax bill."
"6462560","6466200"," They claimed, I guess they passed a law that said I'm getting an improvement tax."
"6466500","6471100"," Every house is getting an improvement tax regardless if you improve it or not. "
"6471100","6474560"," And it's a new tax and I'm like, I'm like there's the fingers."
"6475440","6477140"," I'm like the area of, oh here we go."
"6477700","6478880"," I like this. "
"6479060","6479460"," This is good."
"6480280","6481020"," Hold on here."
"6482340","6483200"," Hold on here. "
"6483300","6483760"," Let me take a look here."
"6483880","6484540"," I'm going to miss this trade."
"6486360","6488020"," We're coming into a buy here. "
"6488720","6490340"," Let me take a look at the background here and see."
"6492800","6493520"," Oh yeah."
"6493880","6494320"," Oh yeah. "
"6494600","6496180"," Double bottom on the hourly trigger."
"6497040","6497640"," Hold on a second here."
"6508430","6510550"," 402 C's in the money. "
"6511710","6512090"," 91 cents."
"6520400","6521340"," Hold on here."
"6522420","6523660"," We've got the hourly. "
"6523660","6524960"," I want to show you guys some."
"6526100","6527360"," Hold on here."
"6528420","6530060"," We've got the hourly trigger. "
"6532020","6533780"," Double bottom on the hourly trigger."
"6534320","6535980"," And we have the hourly trigger coming up."
"6536680","6537620"," Has not rolled over. "
"6537800","6538440"," Looking bullish here."
"6539360","6544800"," We're above the one minute and the five minute trigger on spy right now."
"6546480","6547980"," Bull's not able to put it together. "
"6550300","6551940"," Let's look for a price target above."
"6552180","6553800"," We've got a couple places we can look right."
"6554000","6555460"," Right above here and right above here. "
"6555940","6558280"," We've failed to at least target the high 404."
"6560840","6564160"," I want to see this blue line come up right here and try to target this 404."
"6564720","6567160"," See if we can take this trade here. "
"6568340","6569620"," Let me just a second here."
"6569620","6570960"," Well actually I'll change this to."
"6573560","6574680"," Well down here. "
"6576220","6578500"," I want to see this blue line right here."
"6579240","6580600"," Just get a quick retest."
"6582680","6585340"," Looking at 402 C's they're 81 cents. "

"6627620","6628880"," I'm going to take these trades. "
"6632300","6634560"," I am long right now on spy."
"6635280","6638320"," I do not recommend that you get long on spy."
"6639100","6643480"," I'm going to put a stop loss down here in case they try to give a liquidity break. "
"6644540","6646260"," I'm going to put a stop down below."
"6648830","6650450"," I'll add to my position down here."
"6652030","6655090"," If we get a break and don't break below this bottom down here. "
"6656790","6658150"," I'll add to the position."
"6658350","6666010"," My price target above is 404.08. We'll see how this plays itself out."
"6668150","6669850"," It's a little bit of weight in here. "
"6674580","6676140"," We'll price price target above here."
"6679200","6680080"," See how this one goes."
"6682780","6683920"," Here's the free money box. "
"6685160","6686720"," Now trade 93 cents."
"6687180","6689280"," 91 cents on 402s."
"6698250","6700270"," I hope these sellers don't step back in. "
"6700370","6703470"," Be careful up here too because we had sellers hiding above here."
"6704530","6705830"," Sellers hiding above here."
"6706110","6708510"," Sellers might want to try to come in and roll this right over. "
"6709430","6710870"," Make sure you have some stops on your trade."
"6712810","6713690"," Slow trade in day here."
"6716390","6717710"," Now trade 92 cents. "
"6720450","6721970"," You can see the resistance above."
"6723010","6725050"," This could get rolled over so just be careful."
"6726210","6727150"," Manage your own trades. "
"6744510","6747750"," You did hear me at Grubster yesterday when I was calling you out in stream."
"6750730","6752830"," Yesterday in stream I was calling out Grubster."
"6752970","6753790"," I was like, where's Grubster?"
"6754510","6755870"," I was like, get his ass in here. "
"6761190","6763450"," You want to make sure Grubster hangs around."
"6764910","6766330"," He's like our shop steward."
"6767250","6768950"," We got to make sure he's here every day. "
"6773980","6776880"," Well, something I don't want to see is a break below that blue line."
"6777760","6778920"," So my stops are lower."
"6779140","6783720"," A lot of times last week I was having my stops triggered with liquidity breaks. "
"6784580","6786800"," It's like last week I was putting my stops really high."
"6787600","6789140"," We'd like snap through here."
"6789140","6791260"," My stops were getting triggered. "
"6791660","6794420"," I put a stop really high right here."
"6795240","6798080"," They'd come down and they'd just fucking nail me."
"6798660","6800080"," A green bar straight up. "
"6801180","6802620"," I was taking out of the trade."
"6803020","6805060"," I was looking at my trades last week."
"6805520","6809960"," I was losing money on trades that I directionally was correct on. "
"6810840","6816000"," I was a little pissed off at myself for having my stops that close to my entry."
"6825570","6826670"," Oh, you were driving?"
"6827570","6828450"," Were you laughing?"
"6835470","6838010"," You had the same thing happen to your stops are too close."
"6838330","6839770"," I was a little pissed off about that. "
"6840510","6843890"," I think I had that happen like six or seven times last week."
"6847690","6848130"," Yeah."
"6849170","6851550"," Yeah, I was getting stopped out too soon. "
"6851550","6853330"," I was really frustrated last week."
"6854510","6857890"," I remember the day we really sold off hard and heavy."
"6858130","6860610"," I tried to fucking short the market like three times. "
"6861110","6865030"," And all like three times my three times I was knocked out."
"6865650","6869330"," And then we went down and I was so fucking mad."
"6870630","6871970"," I was pissed. "
"6877020","6879920"," How do they know and how do you stop the market makers from doing that?"
"6881720","6885780"," So the algorithms can tell where limits are where stops are."
"6885780","6887180"," They know exactly where they are."
"6888760","6891060"," They can see, they can see them in the market. "
"6892200","6893720"," There's a bunch of stops down here."
"6894400","6896240"," There's a ton of cell orders down here."
"6896960","6897960"," And there's a ton of buy orders. "
"6898420","6900380"," There's like a cluster of them."
"6900460","6902280"," You can see it on the book map."
"6902500","6906640"," The order flow that I've got on your screen that you see, you can see where there are clusters of"
"6906640","6907420"," buy and sell orders. "
"6908760","6910080"," So they will trade to those."
"6910400","6911780"," They'll trade up and down to those."
"6915470","6916750"," Max pain at all times. "
"6919490","6921450"," And it was broke my desk this morning."
"6921450","6922090"," I was so pissed."
"6922910","6923650"," I've been there. "
"6927510","6929610"," I've actually disassembled the desk before."
"6932720","6934180"," Yeah, Vwap's a big one too."
"6934660","6938600"," So Jason saying, for example, they might know where retail sells and buys Vwap. "
"6938960","6940160"," And they can use it as fuel."
"6940320","6940860"," I agree with that."
"6942140","6943620"," It makes you buy more. "
"6944160","6946880"," So like if I just bought calls here, I might add more calls below."
"6952200","6955400"," Yeah, so beer, you know what I do is sometimes I hand."
"6955680","6957980"," I sometimes I'll just keep my hand on the cell button. "
"6958700","6960460"," And sometimes I set them."
"6960720","6962200"," It depends on the trade that I'm in."
"6962340","6962920"," But I agree with you. "
"6964320","6965660"," I do sometimes hand."
"6966040","6966920"," Hand stop."
"6967300","6968940"," I'll put use hand stops like a finger on a trigger. "
"6974310","6975950"," Both Jason Hendricks and beer."
"6976110","6977010"," He knows exactly what's up."
"6989000","6989440"," Yes. "
"6990220","6995700"," So I lost the, I lost the $90,000 on a put trade."
"6997660","6998620"," 90 grand."
"6999680","7002940"," On a, on a market crash trade. "
"7003700","7005220"," Where I thought we were."
"7005400","7009320"," So you know, you know, it's the same setup as right now."
"7010460","7012460"," So let's say we roll over. "
"7012700","7014480"," You know, I showed you that SPX chart."
"7014840","7016060"," I'll show you exactly what happened."
"7016760","7021160"," This happened in, I don't know what year this was, but on SPX. "
"7024540","7026160"," This is basically what happened."
"7026740","7027420"," It was in the fall."
"7029840","7031140"," We're pretty much right here. "
"7032120","7032940"," We're in the fall."
"7033140","7035180"," It's like, I think it was October and November or something."
"7038560","7040660"," And I've been making like a ton of money and shit. "
"7040800","7043840"," I was like freewheeling like $35,000 trades."
"7043840","7046460"," I think that was pretty much what I was trading in like 30 grand a trade."
"7046840","7050820"," I was getting fucked up like the dealers knew or the, uh, not the dealers. "
"7050960","7051580"," The brokers knew."
"7052000","7054140"," We'll probably sell an order flow on me at that point."
"7054880","7059580"," Um, like, like, I think that they were packaging me in with other retailers with, with big trades"
"7059580","7063660"," and fucking like came down here, got it underneath. "
"7064080","7065920"," And I fucking jumped the gun, man."
"7066100","7066940"," Not only did I jump the gun."
"7067840","7070500"," Like I took this like, like this bloodbath trade. "
"7070500","7073900"," We fucking bounced right back up and kept going up."
"7074340","7076020"," And I didn't cut my losses."
"7076740","7079380"," I fucking was so fucking bullheaded. "
"7080120","7085400"," I believe my trade and we just kept grinding and grinding and grinding and grinding."
"7085960","7087700"," And I got fucking torched."
"7088600","7093180"," I got these are like three month out puts or something or month out puts or something. "
"7094160","7095440"," And I fucking loaded the boat."
"7096100","7097540"," I fucking loaded the boat."
"7098640","7101040"," And I got, I was devastated. "
"7101960","7103220"," And I stayed in, man."
"7103360","7106900"," I stayed in this trade to the bitter fucking end."
"7107720","7110520"," It got so bad that I was like, I don't was like, what do I care about?"
"7110820","7111920"," Five grand or 20 grand. "
"7112700","7113760"," I was like, give a fine fuck."
"7114360","7115320"," I was so mad."
"7115660","7116060"," Oh, dude. "
"7116380","7116920"," Oh, man."
"7117380","7119920"," I was like, I was like, we're just squeezing higher until we roll over."
"7120000","7120740"," They're just looking for liquidity. "
"7121780","7123540"," And I got fucked up."
"7123540","7131480"," I didn't trade for, um, I didn't trade for a while."
"7131700","7133040"," I don't know how much, how long I didn't trade. "
"7133940","7139200"," Uh, this was, I don't know if this was 2019 or 2020, maybe."
"7140020","7141300"," Uh, it was one of those years."
"7142400","7148700"," And I got so fucked up that, um, it was so bad. "
"7148860","7150420"," It was so like, whoa, I didn't want to move that."
"7150420","7151620"," I want to stay there."
"7153060","7155220"," Uh, where I got here, 399, 54. "
"7157500","7158300"," Right here."
"7159480","7165590"," I got so fucked up that, uh, it, it fucked with my mentality."
"7167230","7170910"," Like my mentality was, uh, I was, I was devastated. "
"7171630","7172810"," I was completely fucking devastated."
"7173850","7177190"," My, my children were younger than, so I know, maybe I've been 18."
"7177590","7177950"," Maybe I've been in 2018. "
"7178830","7187350"," I remember that, um, uh, I had asked my wife that my, I remember my kids were outside playing or"
"7187350","7187510"," something."
"7187750","7188570"," My wife was in the house."
"7188570","7192710"," It was like end of the day and I told my wife to take the kids and leave. "
"7193290","7199730"," And I, and I had this beautiful old desk and I proceeded to dismantle it piece by piece."
"7200810","7201750"," I shit, you're not."
"7201870","7202610"," That's true story. "
"7204410","7206650"," That's the last time I ever traded size two."
"7207230","7213890"," The last time that I ever traded size and didn't build a position, like add to a position, go in"
"7213890","7218470"," small, not be seen, not make an impact on the market, that kind of stuff."
"7219790","7221450"," I'll never trade like that ever again. "
"7222170","7223050"," That was a big lesson."
"7223750","7224930"," That was a big trading lesson."
"7225470","7233030"," I don't know how much money you guys trade in size, but I don't trade the sought like options. "
"7233250","7235410"," I don't trade it like the size like I used to."
"7235630","7236950"," I don't think I ever will."
"7238470","7241450"," I don't think I ever never never trade with that size ever again. "
"7242530","7247250"," Not with like, I'm buying a shit ton of puts for $100,000 or something like that."
"7247330","7248250"," I'm not ever doing that again."
"7254170","7254970"," You've been there too. "
"7255470","7257330"," Yeah, I have to fully fucked up by it."
"7257550","7259950"," I didn't."
"7260010","7262030"," Yeah, I think I used a hammer on it. "
"7262310","7262950"," I use the hammer."
"7263550","7264730"," I took a hammer to it."
"7266010","7267770"," And then I just beat the fuck out of it. "
"7267930","7269130"," Sounds like it was killing somebody."
"7270610","7273150"," And I was like, you know what I should have done afterwards?"
"7273470","7276950"," I wish I had got outside with like an axe or something and cut a tree down."
"7277170","7277990"," That's what I should have done. "
"7278710","7284130"," Like cut a tree down in the backyard or like chop some firewood or something."
"7285430","7286710"," And I needed to beat something."
"7286990","7288490"," It was, it was, I was so angry. "
"7288710","7289750"," I don't know if any of you have been there."
"7290190","7291410"," Like you lose a grand or something."
"7292130","7292970"," No big deal. "
"7293070","7295170"," You lose like 10 grand, 20 grand."
"7296210","7298710"," You can absorb that, but like start losing six figures."
"7300450","7301770"," It's fucking devastating. "
"7303410","7308530"," You can trade that money, I guess, in futures market, Globex, like leveraged money."
"7309510","7310730"," Not so dangerous."
"7311330","7312830"," I shouldn't say that I don't trade that money. "
"7312830","7315330"," I'm not being specific enough."
"7315550","7316710"," Like I'm margin and shit."
"7316890","7318290"," I'm like a complex spread. "
"7318690","7324470"," Yeah, you're risking that money, but I'm talking about like $100,000 on fucking red."
"7326790","7328090"," That's what I'm talking about."
"7328570","7331690"," I'm talking about like where we are right now going. "
"7332010","7335510"," I just bought $100,000 and 3000 puts on fucking spy."
"7336270","7337670"," Let it ride, bitches."
"7338970","7339730"," That's what I did. "
"7340510","7341530"," It wasn't that bad."
"7341690","7342430"," It was in the money too."
"7342530","7343350"," The trade was in the money. "
"7343730","7345110"," It just cost me a lot of money."
"7345710","7347310"," And I got fucking torched."
"7348210","7350670"," I got fucking torched. "
"7360530","7362550"," Oh, Jesus Stacy."
"7364650","7366110"," Hey, someone was asking me."

"18783350","18784450"," know why this is happening."
"18784670","18786290"," I don't know what news is going to come out."
"18786870","18791850"," The only way this thing fails is if there's some kind of a news story we don't know. "
"18793310","18797390"," Now, you have to respect and understand this, okay?"
"18797570","18800410"," This isn't just like lines on a chart or moving averages."
"18800810","18801590"," This is what you think it is."
"18802550","18804850"," I'm warning you, okay, that when you see this move higher. "
"18805030","18805710"," You see this right here?"
"18807710","18809750"," You see this, this, this touch here and the cluster?"
"18811430","18812710"," It was this kind of move."
"18814510","18817650"," And then we held this trigger here, right?"
"18819730","18822050"," Bounced came below, but it held, right?"
"18822370","18822910"," Right here held."
"18823670","18825310"," And this trigger that's moving up like this. "
"18827800","18830880"," And you see how, no matter what, it keeps coming higher."
"18837020","18838720"," I don't think it's Monday or Tuesday."
"18840620","18847440"," And when you, when you see this, these two other green lines right here, coming up like so, as long"
"18847440","18853820"," as price stays above this 142 or holds it, even if it comes under for a minute, it doesn't really"
"18853820","18854180"," matter. "
"18854600","18860020"," Things get violent here, but the truth is with this stuff down here below it, and this stuff down"
"18860020","18866200"," here below it, and this one right here down below it, we're going to tell you that there's a fair"
"18866200","18869580"," chance of like straight vertical bars on Apple."
"18870640","18872820"," And there's not going to be anything that's going to stop it."
"18873260","18877840"," I mean, you got to have like a news story, something huge, something that we don't know in the"
"18877840","18878120"," news. "
"18878440","18879680"," So pay attention to the news."
"18880360","18881260"," Next couple days."
"18882840","18885360"," I would not be a bear here. "
"18886200","18890140"," You could be a bear if we get underneath 142 96."
"18891500","18895540"," If you can hold under there, you know, you want, you wouldn't want to dip."
"18895540","18898920"," You'd want like a rejection, start breaking levels. "
"18899520","18903100"," You'd want to be breaking like 138 136 stuff like that."
"18903100","18913100"," But I'm telling you, if you're, I'm just fair warning that there's likely some kind of"
"18913100","18918520"," an explosive move higher and a moon on, you think, you think they're recovery today was something"
"18918520","18919180"," and it's nothing."
"18919680","18921020"," Like, this recovery is nothing. "
"18921420","18927240"," It's going to turn into like what boots did and what CDS is shaping up for."
"18927560","18928820"," And I don't know the reason for this."
"18929240","18933080"," I don't know why it's happening on, I don't know why it's happening on Apple. "
"18933500","18936240"," I don't know if there's a news story that needs to break on this."
"18936580","18937980"," I don't know what the reasoning is."
"18939180","18941720"," I would expect an explosive move on. "
"18941960","18947580"," If that happens, I'm probably going to expect an explosive move on Vix as well."
"18949400","18954040"," If this chart was upside down, I would be telling you I'm very bearish on Apple."
"18954040","18959420"," So I would certainly have a different opinion if this was an upside down chart. "
"18960100","18964600"," So I'm letting you know about the chart price was down below and have a different opinion."
"18964600","18966660"," I'd be saying we're accelerating the downside right now."
"18967440","18970240"," But we are certainly up here. "
"18970460","18974740"," There's there's some kind of a wall up here with like five bears standing behind it."
"18974800","18975800"," It's not like 100 bears."
"18976380","18977460"," It's like five bears. "
"18977980","18982280"," There's not like 3 million bears in one bowl knocking on the front door."
"18982560","18985940"," There's like 3 million bulls with one bear behind the wall."
"18986680","18988940"," So pay attention to this in the next few days. "
"18991480","18998820"," It's not a guaranteed thing, but it's like the like the percentage chance is huge."
"18998920","19006700"," So with that being said and knowing that in another thing too is the bond market's telling you the"
"19006700","19007340"," same thing."
"19008100","19008580"," Okay. "
"19010220","19012920"," The bond market is just straight up right now."
"19013300","19013920"," Just straight up."
"19014020","19014740"," Two days straight up. "
"19015900","19018220"," The bond market's telling you the same thing."
"19018520","19022680"," It's it's it's telling it in spy is not quite showing it yet."
"19022980","19027780"," You see the new high on H Y G and you don't see the new high on on spy. "
"19028460","19029500"," See that in here."
"19030000","19032620"," You see how H Y G broke above broke out."
"19032620","19035060"," This is divergence between H Y G and spy. "
"19035640","19037060"," So I'm going to let you know."
"19037260","19040480"," I mean, I don't care if we pull back a little bit today, but I'm telling you."
"19041060","19045080"," There are there are there's a divergence in H Y G versus spy. "
"19046280","19050140"," No matter what spy is telling you on on price right now."
"19051360","19054760"," And and what's coming up with Apple right now."
"19055000","19057200"," There's this weird move higher in here. "
"19057200","19061440"," That's you know, it's like if you have like one check mark, it's not a big deal."
"19061440","19068080"," But if you have like two check marks, three check marks, four check marks, it starts to like, you"
"19068080","19069880"," know, walk, talk and look like a duck, right?"
"19071320","19075240"," So there's something here hidden behind behind the surface of the market."
"19077100","19080360"," And if I'm looking at the next two days, tomorrow's Friday. "
"19086490","19087550"," Tomorrow's Friday, man."
"19087870","19088990"," I'm looking for four 10."
"19090170","19094670"," I'm looking for four 10 as a price target tomorrow between today and tomorrow. "
"19096790","19097590"," Right there."
"19098630","19099970"," That's what I'm looking for tomorrow."
"19100910","19102850"," I'm not even waiting for Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"19103510","19108310"," Maybe it's something where we squeeze up here and then it comes down for the 31st."
"19108610","19113130"," So they're guaranteed they get their 406 sums here."
"19114790","19117450"," Smell it can smell it like a rat can smell it. "
"19119350","19122470"," Fair chance of a gap up if it doesn't happen in the close today."
"19123350","19124970"," This is a rear occurrence."
"19125390","19129250"," If we can't get it done in cash market, we're famous for getting it done. "
"19129850","19132130"," We're famous for getting it done in overnight."
"19134410","19135910"," Can't get it done in cash market."
"19136350","19141090"," PJ, well, the the the banks will come right in and move this shit up like it's nothing. "
"19142950","19143990"," Like it ain't no thing."

"19149150","19150190"," You want to call this distribution. "
"19150990","19154990"," I'm fucking telling you that's not distribution and tell them whatever you want."

"19189350","19190250"," I've seen this before."
"19191650","19193050"," Can't get it done in cash market. "
"19193050","19198450"," They come in right in the overnight like little tinkerers and they just like gremlins and boom"
"19198450","19199790"," prices where it's supposed to be."
"19207390","19208350"," That's my price target."
"19208710","19214850"," I'm going to give you a price target of 409, 410 before tomorrow's done. "
"19215510","19218990"," And then we come back down to 406 for the 31st."
"19219810","19222810"," If you're a bear, I would if you're a bear, you can be a bear."
"19222970","19226510"," Just let me I'd be standing out of the way until it rolls over. "
"19227410","19228150"," You know what I mean?"
"19228350","19233530"," You can you can you can take the short just don't get in the way of what's possible."
"19235010","19239750"," You just stand the side waiting till it's done when it's done its thing when it's lost its steam"

"19305520","19307620"," Maybe it moons in the overnight."
"19307740","19309040"," Some news we don't know."
