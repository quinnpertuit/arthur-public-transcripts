"KwoWW8RhjI4","0","14000"," That's if it works."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","14000","19000"," Boom."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","19000","21000"," Let's see if he can raise in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","46280","48280"," Oh yeah, someone's in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","49000","50000"," Sweet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","50000","52000"," What up?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","52000","54000"," What up, brothers?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","54000","57000"," What up, Emerson?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","57000","59000"," Let's turn that shit off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","59000","61000"," Let's get rolling."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","64000","66000"," How's everybody doing? Welcome back."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","66000","69000"," Oh yeah, I got some work to do here for sure."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","69000","71000"," So some of your..."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","71000","74000"," Some of your stuff is cut off here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","74000","75000"," Let's see if I can..."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","75000","78000"," Yeah, I can see what you're talking about now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","80000","81000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","81000","84000"," God, I don't know if I'm from the right place over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","84000","86000"," Maybe I should have brought something up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","86000","88000"," We'll bring this up first."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","88000","90000"," Oh yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","90000","93000"," Oh, we'll leave that up right there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","93000","95000"," We'll start with this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","95000","97000"," How's everybody doing?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","97000","101000"," How's the yes?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","101000","104000"," It's going to be good."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","104000","106000"," I got that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","106000","108000"," You guys see that beautiful camera over there?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","108000","110000"," See that thing over there?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","110000","112000"," That's pretty nice."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","112000","116000"," I know it's been weeks."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","116000","119000"," This has been nothing but a nightmare."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","119000","122000"," Without a doubt."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","122000","125000"," I'll leave some of these streams up here for you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","125000","130000"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","130000","132000"," Everybody's coming in right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","132000","134000"," Good to see everybody."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","134000","136000"," Yeah, we're going to be getting..."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","137000","138000"," We're going to be getting..."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","138000","140000"," We get a lot of shit coming through here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","140000","141000"," It's going to be badass."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","141000","143000"," You guys are going to be stoked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","143000","146000"," I'm going to put a live stream inside of the discord"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","146000","152000"," with the flow algo in there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","152000","155000"," How's everybody doing?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","155000","157000"," What just happened with the mix?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","157000","159000"," Yeah, we should be selling off here just so you know."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","159000","162000"," We'll talk about that here in just a minute."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","162000","164000"," We should be right around here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","164000","169000"," 28, 74, pretty decent place to sell off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","169000","173000"," 4300, pretty decent place to sell off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","173000","174000"," And we'll talk about it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","174000","175000"," This is dispersion, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","175000","177000"," This is what you call dispersion."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","177000","179000"," We have accumulation."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","179000","182000"," And then we've got the rise in price."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","182000","185000"," And then we're going to distribute it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","185000","189000"," Even if we're continuing to go up, we're going to distribute it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","189000","192000"," And then we'll make our next leg up if we continue to go up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","192000","194000"," If not, and we start to roll the market over,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","194000","199000"," then we'll turn that off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","199000","202000"," And let me get to the live stream here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","202000","204000"," It's kind of the same thing, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","204000","205000"," But I'm going to switch this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","205000","208000"," I want to talk to you guys about something, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","208000","209000"," Everything looks more clear."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","209000","211000"," Oh yeah, this should be dopeness now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","211000","214000"," Like pure dopeness, there shouldn't be any more problems at all."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","214000","216000"," I shouldn't ever have any..."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","216000","218000"," If you guys are lagging at all right now,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","218000","221000"," you guys can speed up your stream until you catch up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","221000","224000"," And there should only be a delay of seconds."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","224000","226000"," Just press fast forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","226000","229000"," My voice will get weird for about 15 seconds."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","229000","232000"," And then the Vuo voice will smooth right out for you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","232000","235000"," And you'll be just a few moments behind me."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","235000","238000"," Okay, it's almost like a real true live live stream."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","238000","240000"," So we're going to catch a little bit of a bit here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","240000","242000"," We're going to talk about something real quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","242000","244000"," I don't know what positions are in out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","244000","247000"," But it's probably important for us to go through"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","247000","248000"," at this point today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","248000","250000"," This is from this morning."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","250000","252000"," I was at all the volatile overnight session"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","252000","254000"," with futures currently trading at 40."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","254000","256000"," That was this morning, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","256000","258000"," We looked for elevated volatility to continue"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","258000","261000"," as long as the S&P is under the 4300 strike."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","261000","263000"," There's a way to key into this right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","263000","266000"," As long as you're under 4300, we got volatility, baby."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","266000","269000"," Resistance lines appear at 4249, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","269000","272000"," And we remember we opened this morning right here,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","272000","274000"," and we traded above it, and we melted up all day long,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","274000","277000"," and we're getting close to that 4300, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","277000","280000"," Support actually still lies down below at 4200,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","280000","284000"," and believe it or not, true support's at 4076."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","284000","287000"," So we haven't even bypassed 4300 yet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","287000","291000"," And until we get past 4300, find some support,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","291000","294000"," we can't break past volatility, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","294000","298000"," So if you want to be bullish, it's over 4300."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","298000","301000"," As we approach 4300, you take your winnings, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","301000","302000"," You take your money off the table,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","302000","307000"," and you wait for the banks again to trade us higher, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","307000","310000"," And this is also another spot that you put some protection"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","310000","312000"," on into the market, if you're a bear,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","312000","315000"," this is where you want to lean into the market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","315000","318000"," to trade us down to 4000, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","318000","320000"," 76, and we're going to look at something here in just a minute."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","320000","322000"," That's important for you bulls out there that are saying,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","322000","324000"," oh, fuck no, we're going higher here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","324000","326000"," I got something to show all of you guys out there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","326000","327000"," I want to talk to you guys about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","327000","329000"," Some of you probably know about this,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","329000","331000"," but it came up yesterday."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","331000","333000"," We flashed a crash yesterday,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","333000","337000"," and the markets reaction this morning is not unexpected,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","337000","342000"," and even in the crash being flashed,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","342000","347000"," it's kind of mimics what happens in these movements, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","347000","350000"," Right where we are right now, we should see high volatility"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","350000","355000"," because of the market crash flashing, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","355000","358000"," We should have swings that are violent up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","358000","360000"," because we're going to probably most likely,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","360000","364000"," but a high probability of some serious downward moves."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","364000","366000"," I know this sounds uber bearish,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","366000","367000"," and the day's been super happy,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","367000","369000"," and everybody's all stoked out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","369000","370000"," I'm going to show you a couple of things, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","370000","372000"," I want you guys to key into."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","372000","375000"," Like yesterday, the key range is framed by the large interest"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","375000","377000"," at 4,000 and 4,300, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","377000","380000"," They want to burn all these puts down here at 4,000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","380000","382000"," We know that as well, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","382000","384000"," We look for volatility to reduce."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","384000","388000"," In between that range, we expect price action to remain fluid."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","388000","391000"," If markets get above 4,300 look for volatility to reduce, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","391000","395000"," That would mean that you're going to then pick up this trade above 4,300"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","395000","396000"," if you're a bull."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","396000","399000"," But until then, you're going to take the money off the table, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","399000","404000"," We also see 4,400 as major resistance, right, into 3,16."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","404000","407000"," So if we get over 4,300, what do you do?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","407000","410000"," We find some support, we try to start to consolidate."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","410000","413000"," You're going to then take a long up to 4,400, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","413000","415000"," If this happens, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","415000","417000"," But at this point, where we are in the market,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","417000","420000"," we're now down to 427.56."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","420000","424000"," We know that we're going to encounter some resistance here at this,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","424000","426000"," right around this area, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","426000","428000"," As we start to hit this 4,300 mark."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","428000","431000"," And we're going to talk about something that's not shown here in a moment, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","431000","433000"," In regards to that lower bound concept, we discussed the length."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","433000","435000"," That remains in play, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","435000","437000"," Less than equal to 4,100."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","437000","440000"," This is ultimately due to the large open interest at 4,000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","440000","445000"," As you can see in the game of chart below, under 4,100, the profile flattens out"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","445000","448000"," this along with our view that dealers a long tail risk, suggest dealer hedging"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","448000","453000"," requirements may be reduced less or equal to 4,100 through our lens."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","453000","454000"," This implies support."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","454000","459000"," Their point to you or their point that they're making to you is that we should"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","459000","466000"," find some kind of support somewhere around 4,100 or 407, I think, 49 or whatever"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","466000","467000"," down below, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","467000","471000"," These numbers change every day of the fucking week, depending on how we're"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","471000","472000"," trading."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","472000","475000"," The other key thing to key into was yesterday's close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","475000","479000"," And yesterday's close, no matter where we traded to today, right, was a signal"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","479000","482000"," that we're going to probably trade even lower."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","482000","485000"," And we're going to talk about what's been setting up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","485000","489000"," We've talked in the past about when you start putting bad weeks together, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","489000","492000"," It'll equal works itself into a bad month."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","492000","494000"," We start to add bad months together."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","494000","496000"," It starts to add to a bad quarter."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","496000","498000"," You start adding bad quarters together, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","498000","501000"," And the recovery takes longer and longer over time."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","501000","504000"," If you're putting together bad months, you're putting together bad quarters, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","504000","506000"," It's not that you can't reverse the trend."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","506000","508000"," It's that how long does it take, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","508000","511000"," You're not going to go from having two, three bad quarters."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","511000","514000"," And then all of a sudden you're at all time highs that following quarter."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","514000","518000"," You're going to have to work your way back from all that damage has been done to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","518000","519000"," the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","519000","521000"," And so we're going to talk about that, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","521000","524000"," As we stack this stuff up over time, what does it mean?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","524000","530000"," And we have an indicator, a simple way for you to look, a simple indicator for you to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","530000","533000"," look at that the damage has been done inside of this market, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","533000","535000"," Now we've got a little bit of the calendar later."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","535000","536000"," I'm going to go directly over."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","536000","538000"," We're on SPX right now, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","538000","546000"," And I want to show you guys something because of the damage that's been done in the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","546000","548000"," A little on here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","548000","549000"," We'll do them separately."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","549000","550000"," We'll just do two of them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","550000","551000"," We'll do two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","551000","552000"," Can I do two of them here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","552000","553000"," Yeah, I can do two of them here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","553000","555000"," We're going to take a look at this right here, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","555000","557000"," And we're going to change this up here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","557000","560000"," Some of you probably already know, right, with what I'm going to show you here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","560000","561000"," Some of you don't."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","561000","562000"," Some of you do."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","562000","564000"," But just bear with me here, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","564000","566000"," So we're going to change that to 50."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","566000","568000"," We're going to change the 52."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","568000","570000"," Matter of fact, we're going to make that a nice red color."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","570000","571000"," It's important that it's a red color."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","571000","574000"," Make a nice and fat so we can all see it, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","574000","575000"," Boom."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","575000","577000"," And then we're going to change this one right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","577000","579000"," What do you guys think I'm going to change this one too?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","579000","581000"," I bet some of you know what I'm going to change this one too, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","581000","584000"," I'm going to change this one to the 200, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","584000","586000"," And I'm going to change the color."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","586000","590000"," We're going to make this one so we can actually make this look really nice here, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","590000","593000"," And we're going to go okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","593000","597000"," And we're going to make sure this one's fatter so that you can see."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","597000","599000"," Yeah, it's that one's fatter, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","599000","600000"," That's good."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","600000","601000"," Okay, we're good here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","601000","602000"," We're good."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","602000","605000"," We'll make this yellow one smaller so you can visualize it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","605000","608000"," What I'm talking about here in a better way."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","608000","610000"," Maybe even like this, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","610000","611000"," And visualize it like that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","611000","613000"," Now, let me get a little bit thicker."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","613000","614000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","614000","615000"," It's good enough."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","615000","618000"," Okay, what I want to show you guys is this, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","618000","623000"," I want to show you guys this confluence that's taking place here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","623000","624000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","624000","628000"," And I want you to see right when this 50, this is the 50 in red, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","628000","631000"," I want you to see what happens when it starts to cross over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","631000","634000"," I want you to see how low we are right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","634000","636000"," The couple key points I want you to look at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","636000","640000"," I want you to see how low we still actually are today, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","640000","644000"," I want you to see how far we have to go for this confluence not to happen."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","644000","648000"," And I also want you to realize that as this confluence starts to take place,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","648000","652000"," you're going to see high volatility and you're seeing it in today's market already."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","652000","654000"," And I want to show you in the past,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","654000","656000"," there's more than a deli chart here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","656000","659000"," On a simple moving average and I want to show you what happens."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","659000","661000"," And I want you to see right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","661000","662000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","662000","663000"," This is March 2020."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","663000","665000"," See this high volatility in here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","665000","666000"," See this move right here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","666000","668000"," 2861, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","668000","671000"," We moved all the way up to 3143, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","671000","673000"," That's a huge move."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","673000","674000"," Huge, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","674000","679000"," And this is just before a cross of the 50 over the 200, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","679000","682000"," So look at this and then look at this over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","682000","685000"," And I want to show you that because we could be recovering today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","685000","686000"," We could recover today tomorrow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","686000","689000"," We could recover and blast off to all time."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","689000","690000"," Not all time."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","690000","695000"," We could blast off all the way into the FOMC, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","695000","699000"," And literally sell this market down and be a bloodbath."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","700000","703000"," A straight, utter bloodbath."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","703000","706000"," So be aware of this crossover taking place, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","706000","708000"," Do you guys know what these are called?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","708000","709000"," I think some of you know what they're called,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","709000","711000"," but I think it's not all of you do."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","711000","713000"," We'll leave that for the end."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","713000","715000"," I want to show it to you again, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","715000","716000"," I want to show it to you again in the past."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","716000","717000"," Boom."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","717000","718000"," There's one, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","718000","719000"," Here's another one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","719000","720000"," Boom, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","720000","722000"," This is a killer for bulls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","722000","725000"," Killer brutal move back here, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","725000","726000"," Look at how..."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","726000","728000"," We're not that close here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","728000","732000"," But here's one instance, right, where we got close, but not too close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","732000","735000"," But we had a huge move down in here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","735000","738000"," So we want to see this 50 raised back up, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","738000","740000"," This is an instance where it didn't work."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","740000","744000"," But I want you to want to show you here when you get that close, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","744000","746000"," I want to show you when you get that close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","746000","747000"," This isn't that close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","747000","750000"," When you're down here and it gets close, if it crosses over,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","750000","751000"," bam, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","751000","755000"," And then talk about trying to recover here and get in bam."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","755000","756000"," You get knocked back down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","756000","758000"," We're going, this is what?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","758000","761000"," Excuse me, this is May, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","761000","763000"," Of 2015."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","763000","767000"," So I'm showing you now how rare this happens, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","767000","770000"," We're now back seven years in the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","770000","773000"," But here's another one, bam, bam, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","773000","775000"," I'm going back now a decade, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","775000","780000"," It's so rare to see this take place in the market that we get that close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","780000","782000"," And NASDAQ's already crossed over."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","782000","785000"," That's why you see such a huge reaction today in NASDAQ."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","785000","786000"," Right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","786000","787000"," I'll show you NASDAQ."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","787000","788000"," I'll show you NQ."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","788000","790000"," I'm going to show you IWM, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","790000","794000"," I want you to see that it's already taken place."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","794000","796000"," I think it's already taken place."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","796000","797000"," Yeah, we've already crossed over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","797000","800000"," Look at this violent move down in NASDAQ, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","800000","803000"," This relentless selling down in here, okay?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","803000","808000"," Let's look at IWM and see what's going on with IWM and see how close that one is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","808000","809000"," Right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","809000","810000"," Boom."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","810000","812000"," Close down over here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","812000","813000"," Boom, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","813000","815000"," So you've already seen this take place."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","815000","821000"," We already know what the chances are with this cross taking place of another violent move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","821000","822000"," down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","822000","823000"," You already got this violent move here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","823000","828000"," So my only concern is that when you're looking at spy, you're looking at ES and you're saying"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","828000","829000"," everything's going to be fine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","829000","830000"," We're fine cap."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","830000","833000"," The market's going to recover and everything's going to be great."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","833000","834000"," But I'm going to show it to you here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","834000","835000"," This is ES here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","835000","837000"," This is how close we actually are."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","837000","840000"," I want you to take note of this here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","840000","845000"," If we get this crossing here at any point in this next week or two, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","845000","847000"," This is going to get nasty."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","847000","849000"," There ain't no way about it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","849000","853000"," So keep yourself focused even in this recovery play."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","853000","855000"," You could literally recover here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","855000","857000"," I mean, look at this recovery you could make."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","857000","860000"," Probably make this recovery somewhere around 4,400."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","860000","862000"," Is that what they were saying?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","862000","863000"," Right there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","863000","868000"," Make this recovery right and not break the previous high."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","868000","869000"," You see the previous high over here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","869000","871000"," We can go closer."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","871000","873000"," Bring this over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","873000","875000"," If you don't break this previous high, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","875000","877000"," Break free of this previous high."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","877000","879000"," That's 4420 or so."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","879000","881000"," Probably call it 4,400."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","881000","884000"," You have 4,400 hand grenades and horseshoes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","884000","888000"," If you don't break this previous high, you know what's going to happen right here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","888000","891000"," We're going to sell this market bad, like blood bath bad."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","891000","893000"," Blood bath bad."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","893000","894000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","894000","896000"," This is the general market health, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","896000","898000"," You've already seen weakness in NQ."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","898000","901000"," You've already seen weakness in IWM."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","901000","903000"," The market internal still aren't there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","903000","907000"," There are other aspects to this market that haven't had a blood bath yet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","907000","908000"," We know that, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","908000","912000"," We know that there's more room to be made going down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","912000","914000"," Just keep this on your plate."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","914000","916000"," All this bullishness that we get right here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","916000","921000"," We haven't seen this, but due to a handful of times in 10, 20 years,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","921000","923000"," this is not that often."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","923000","925000"," Very dangerous in the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","925000","930000"," We come on Twitter and I'd say to you, hey, we're flashing a crash right now in the market, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","930000","934000"," There's other reasons we're flashing a crash when you're, but this is an easy indicator"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","934000","935000"," for you to be looking at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","935000","939000"," This is a simple way for this is something that you just don't see."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","939000","943000"," We haven't seen this the last time was two years ago."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","943000","945000"," And we just look back a couple of decades."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","945000","949000"," And even those times it was very rare that we even got this close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","949000","953000"," It's not like we're, it's not like we're sitting here going,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","953000","955000"," hey, yeah, Cap, we're over here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","955000","957000"," And we're kind of curling it up over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","957000","959000"," It's not like you're saying, oh, yeah, Cap, we're, you know, we're over there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","959000","961000"," We're literally right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","961000","962000"," We're here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","962000","963000"," There's no other."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","963000","964000"," You can't get any closer."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","964000","967000"," You start coming down right here and you make that cross."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","967000","969000"," There'll be no, it could happen in the overnight."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","969000","972000"," And you're literally straight down to the depths of hell."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","972000","973000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","973000","975000"," Let's be conscious of this as we move forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","975000","977000"," I'm going to turn that one off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","977000","979000"," We don't need down right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","979000","982000"," And matter of fact, it's weird because I don't have my, this chart."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","982000","987000"," I had logged in and this chart doesn't match the spot gamma numbers at all."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","987000","991000"," But what we'll do is we'll take a quick look at the chart here for you as you trade forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","991000","993000"," And there's some positives here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","993000","996000"," Every time we trade off or coming up, every time we trade off or come up,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","996000","998000"," this is a melt up scenario, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","998000","1001000"," Trade off, come up, trade off, come up, trade down, starting to come up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1001000","1004000"," Hopefully you can break this plane or even if we trade this down here,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1004000","1006000"," we can, we can make one more plane to close."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1006000","1010000"," But I want to show you guys, see if I can move this chart down a little bit here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1010000","1016000"," It's actually come lower because of where we are, like 430 somewhere in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1018000","1020000"," So we can make this a little bit better here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1020000","1022000"," Yeah, we're somewhere in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1023000","1028000"," Right in here in this 430 and this line is inaccurate too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1028000","1031000"," This line is inaccurate."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1031000","1033000"," It's right in there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1033000","1037000"," You can probably get rid of this one too, because you ain't going to need it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1037000","1042000"," The only thing you really need to know about in here is you can see these peaks up here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1042000","1044000"," Sell, sell, sell."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1044000","1047000"," We trade it outside of our established trading area."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1047000","1050000"," Let me move this one back here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1059000","1061000"," Start this way up here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1068000","1071000"," And you can see here that we traded outside of our trading area."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1071000","1073000"," We could take that nice and long, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1073000","1077000"," We still rolled it over, rolled it over, rolled it down super far, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1077000","1082000"," Rolled it over, rolled it over, come back up here, rolled down, stayed now inside our bounds, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1082000","1084000"," It's a huge rejection here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1084000","1085000"," This was terrible."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1085000","1088000"," Came back down, bounced off some support, and we traded it straight back up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1088000","1090000"," We're coming into resistance here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1090000","1092000"," So it's now, this was the trade, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1092000","1095000"," The next trade is above here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1095000","1097000"," We start to come into some resistance."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1097000","1101000"," If you're bullish, you want to take this, you want to take this trade after."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1101000","1106000"," Or if you're like, hey, we might want to close here and not gap up, but hey, cap, or gap it up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1106000","1109000"," And you just put on some, you put on some cheap put spreads, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1109000","1113000"," Or free ones, you know, that put ratio spreads, put back spreads."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1113000","1114000"," They're free, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1114000","1120000"," You know, if they, if we start to trade higher, you can cut one side loose and just make money on the way higher here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1121000","1126000"," But so if you wanted to take this gap up and say, hey, cap, fuck you, we're super hella bullish right now, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1126000","1133000"," You're still going to put some, some, some, some, or put some, some, some protection on here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1133000","1137000"," Because I'm going to promise you that the bears are just waiting to take this short right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1137000","1140000"," The bears are just waiting to load them up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1140000","1141000"," I was watching them all day long."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1141000","1146000"," Today I was watching puts get bought from, from when we opened until right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1146000","1147000"," They're just loading them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1147000","1152000"," They're just loading them up for the next week or two in anticipation of this, of this rollover one last rollover."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1152000","1156000"," You already know about the cross coming up the death cross, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1156000","1159000"," Coming up inside of the S&P 500, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1159000","1161000"," So there, and this is their grand finale here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1161000","1162000"," They want to take it down, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1162000","1164000"," And you know where we wind up down here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1164000","1167000"," We don't wind up at 405 if we get that death cross."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1167000","1170000"," We wind up at like 390, 380, 370."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1170000","1173000"," That's how deep it actually goes down there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1173000","1176000"," You're going to see Amazon trading at 2000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1176000","1181000"," You're going to see Apple just burn it off 140 or less, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1181000","1183000"," You're going to see that happen."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1183000","1187000"," So if that takes place, there's high danger there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1187000","1189000"," So how do you deal with that if you're a bull?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1189000","1195000"," Well, you, you take your money and run right up here in this, in this, in this volatility zone."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1195000","1199000"," You wait, you either wait to pick it back up here or if you're like,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1199000","1203000"," Hey, Cap, I want to put on some, some zero dates or I want to put on some Friday dates,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1203000","1205000"," some zero dates for Friday, three day dates or whatever."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1205000","1210000"," Or hey, Cap, I want to take a long position here and not fuck with the volatility and put on some,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1210000","1212000"," some spreads, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1212000","1215000"," Some credit spreads or some, some calendar spreads, whatever, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1215000","1219000"," The one thing I'll warn you here is you grab your ratio, put spreads to protect the trades."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1219000","1222000"," The other thing I would say to you is if you don't want to put that risk on,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1222000","1225000"," you want to be a bull that played trade safe, then you wait until we trade above this,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1225000","1226000"," above this volatility zone."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1226000","1228000"," This is a bull town up there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1228000","1231000"," If you're a bear out there, what are you doing right here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1231000","1234000"," Fucking, you're, you are fucking loading the fuck up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1234000","1235000"," You were loading up short."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1235000","1236000"," You're loading up with puts."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1236000","1238000"," You're fucking, you're buying, baby."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1238000","1239000"," You're buying."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1239000","1240000"," You're buying."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1240000","1242000"," And, and, you know, Winky, I don't know if Winky's in here right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1242000","1245000"," I'm not looking at the chat right, but he's a smart fucking trader."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1245000","1247000"," And he always makes that point, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1247000","1249000"," They're going to burn the shit out of bears."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1249000","1251000"," Well, the bears got paid here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1251000","1254000"," They're not going to fucking pay bears right in this area that we're in right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1254000","1256000"," They're not going to send it down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1256000","1258000"," They'll probably trade higher and then roll it over."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1258000","1260000"," So, if you're a bear, what are you going to do?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1260000","1264000"," And what Winky made a good point about was, if you're going to start getting shortened"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1264000","1268000"," in here, don't be like, I'm getting the 18th because we know that all the puts are on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1268000","1269000"," the 18th."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1269000","1271000"," We know that they're all loaded there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1271000","1275000"," So, you might want to get it a week later, week after, or even closer."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1275000","1278000"," You don't want to be getting where all the puts are because they're going to attempt"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1278000","1282000"," to not print those 400 P's, those 390 P's."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1282000","1283000"," They're out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1283000","1289000"," They're all 390 P's out there right now currently in the market being held in anticipation of"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1289000","1291000"," this next leg down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1291000","1297000"," Now, can we trade higher and take this bullish even higher than 440?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1297000","1298000"," Eh, I doubt it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1298000","1300000"," See all that damage back there?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1300000","1302000"," Let's say we do get super bullish."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1302000","1304000"," We're still only going to trade it up to 440."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1304000","1307000"," And then we're going to, we're going to, we're going to sell it down again."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1307000","1311000"," We'll consolidate until we can find more room to move higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1311000","1313000"," What you'll end up doing is you'll get the FOMC."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1313000","1317000"," Let's say we're, let's hear it bullish because of the stupid shit that happened in, in Europe,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1317000","1318000"," right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1318000","1321000"," Let's say we trade this up here and we're like, okay, the Fed's probably not going to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1321000","1324000"," The Fed's probably going to tell us that the market sold off enough."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1324000","1327000"," The Fed puts coming in a lease for in the next quarter."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1327000","1333000"," We have insecurity with gas and all this other bullshit out there and you, you sure, whatever"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1333000","1336000"," the bullshit they make up like Europe did, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1336000","1337000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1337000","1338000"," So we sell down here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1338000","1342000"," We're going to be looking for consolidation phase, believe it or not, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1342000","1345000"," And then after FOMC, we'll, we'll attempt to make a move higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1345000","1349000"," Now, even if we make that move higher, it's probably going to be something like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1349000","1355000"," And the reason for that is because of the damage that we did over, over, it took what?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1355000","1357000"," Three, it took a two months, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1357000","1360000"," Two months, basically it'll be almost three months of damage."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1360000","1363000"," So you're not going to see it happen in like five days."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1364000","1371000"," That correction being over move, I made it over like the course of 15 days is probably"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1371000","1376000"," more like a month, probably going to take a month to get back to some kind of all-time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1376000","1377000"," highs."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1377000","1378000"," I doubt you do it in like three days."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1378000","1381000"," I doubt you do it on the 18th of March."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1381000","1382000"," You might, but I doubt it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1382000","1385000"," I think you're going to get some more consolidation."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1385000","1388000"," You're going to need to mark the market to have a reason to go up from here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1388000","1391000"," You're going to need the Fed to give you a reason for the market to go up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1391000","1394000"," So I just want to be careful of this as we trade over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1394000","1398000"," I want you to take money off the table as we hit 430."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1398000","1402000"," When we start to have these resistance levels, why fuck with the banks?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1402000","1403000"," Let the banks do it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1403000","1407000"," If you come into the close at 430, what do you do there, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1407000","1410000"," You already know, like, hey, Cap, I'm going to put a bunch more risk on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1410000","1414000"," All right, take all your money off the table, take 10% of it, get yourself some zero dates,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1414000","1420000"," load up another 20 or 30% on some putback spreads heading into tomorrow, at least."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1420000","1423000"," If not into next week or the week thereafter."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1423000","1424000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1424000","1425000"," We've traded this before."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1425000","1428000"," We've traded this stuff from this channel all the time here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1428000","1429000"," You know, exactly where we are in the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1429000","1431000"," We know exactly where we're going in the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1431000","1438000"," And I want you to be aware that that crut, that death cross that's forming on the S&P is no fucking joke."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1438000","1440000"," That is no joking."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1440000","1441000"," And I'm telling you right now, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1441000","1442000"," It's given you fair warning."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1442000","1447000"," It's not like you're coming in and you're like one day and you come in and say, hey, Cap, why the fuck did we sell down?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1447000","1451000"," You know, 300 points in two days or something insane."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1451000","1453000"," This, this is nothing right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1453000","1454000"," Like this move right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1454000","1456000"," You'll see this moving like a day or two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1456000","1458000"," They'll take a day or two, three days."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1458000","1460000"," You'll see, you'll see a correction down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1460000","1463000"," We'll look, we'll look and see, we'll look and see how deep it'll go."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1463000","1464000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1464000","1467000"," Something like this down here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1467000","1471000"," Something like this could take place and then within the next week."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1471000","1474000"," Within the next week, you can see something like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1474000","1475000"," Right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1475000","1476000"," You see a move like down here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1476000","1480000"," Let's say you see a move that's even deeper down here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1480000","1481000"," Right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1481000","1482000"," You get trapped down here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1482000","1486000"," What they do, what they'll do is they'll sell it down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1486000","1487000"," Right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1487000","1489000"," You get some kind of move like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1489000","1491000"," And it's going to attempt to recover."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1491000","1492000"," Right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1492000","1493000"," You can be scared."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1493000","1494000"," Chilis."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1494000","1495000"," And it's not going to happen."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1495000","1497000"," That's going to be something like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1497000","1498000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1498000","1500000"," I don't fucking this up, but you get the point, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1500000","1502000"," And that's a bloodbath down in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1503000","1506000"," I was looking at three sixties and I'm like, that's a bloodbath."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1506000","1509000"," And the worst part is right around this area here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1509000","1514000"," It starts to set up these, these waterfalls of downward moves."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1514000","1518000"," You could see if this is, I think this correlates somewhere around 12,000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1518000","1521000"," On, uh, and, and, uh, an NDX on NASDAQ."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1521000","1523000"," Don't call me on this off the check it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1523000","1527000"," Uh, but if you start to break below that 12,000 mark, good night, ladies."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1527000","1528000"," Good night."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1528000","1530000"," Cause you're opening the doors down below."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1530000","1532000"," Believe it or not, to like the 200s."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1532000","1538000"," You're like literally opening the door down to, uh, into, into actually losing this market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1538000","1540000"," You'll have a liquidation style event."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1540000","1546000"," You'll have, you'll have literally have, um, algorithms and the big banks sell this market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1546000","1548000"," whether you want it to sell or not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1548000","1552000"," So we're getting very close to that point and just be aware of that as a trade higher here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1552000","1555000"," You don't have to save the entire world."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1555000","1559000"," Uh, you take money off the table as we trade up here, especially as we come into here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1559000","1562000"," Let's say you're like, Hey, Cap, we're going to trade this into the clothes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1562000","1563000"," We're going to trade higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1563000","1564000"," That's fine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1564000","1565000"," Just take some off the table up in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1565000","1567000"," Take some money and run."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1567000","1568000"," You want to leave a few runners."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1568000","1571000"," You want to be like, Hey, Cap, it's giving you a gap again tomorrow into clothes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1571000","1572000"," That's fine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1572000","1573000"," Take some runners off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1573000","1575000"," Uh, take some runners off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1575000","1578000"," Let me see if we can fix this for you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1578000","1580000"," Somewhere up in here, you take some runners off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1580000","1582000"," You let a couple run up in here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1582000","1583000"," Maybe it gets rejected."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1583000","1588000"," Maybe we do this, this stupid shit that we normally do right up in here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1588000","1589000"," And you want to grab that as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1589000","1590000"," That's fine, too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1590000","1593000"," But just know that as you're making these moves up, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1593000","1598000"," If we're going to make this move up either today or tomorrow, anything, any kind of nonsense"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1598000","1600000"," like this, I want you to be aware of that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1600000","1604000"," Well, I want you to be aware of the fact that we can consolidate after this or sell it down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1604000","1605000"," after this as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1605000","1608000"," But what I want you to be aware of is that you don't want to keep giving your money back."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1608000","1610000"," You want to take your money off the table."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1610000","1612000"," You want to reenter each trade."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1612000","1617000"," And then as you are in this zone here, if you're going to stay bullish,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1617000","1622000"," you have to put some protection on because whether it rolls over now or it rolls over"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1622000","1626000"," in five days or three days, it'll eventually print, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1626000","1631000"," So if you grab yourself some put spreads here of some kind, any kind you like, I guarantee,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1631000","1637000"," no matter if we do, if we stop here or if we stop above, if they're five days out,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1637000","1641000"," they're in the money somewhere in here or in the money somewhere over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1641000","1646000"," Eventually, we're going to trade back down a week or two, five days, three days,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1646000","1648000"," volatility into FOMC."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1648000","1651000"," And so let's say you're like, hey, I printed all those calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1651000","1655000"," I took the money and ran and my put spreads are burning cap."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1655000","1656000"," What should I do with them?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1656000","1659000"," You just hold them because three to five days later, we're going to correct back down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1659000","1663000"," And even if it's only not crazy deep, even if we bounce off this channel here,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1663000","1666000"," you're at least going to come back into that money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1666000","1669000"," You're going to be close to it to when it to when they expire."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1669000","1672000"," You're going to take your money and run 20, 30, 50%."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1672000","1676000"," If we start bloodbath and it down, you're going to get printed the print on the call side"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1676000","1678000"," and the put side."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1678000","1684000"," If we just start blasting off and never return, we blow past 440, 450, what do you care?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1684000","1687000"," You're making shit tons of money on zero dates."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1687000","1689000"," And what do you fucking care?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1689000","1693000"," You could give a rat's ass if those puts print at that point because you're just making hand"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1693000","1696000"," over fist cash as we trade each level higher, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1696000","1700000"," So just be careful of that of this as we trade for it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1700000","1702000"," We've had this conversation."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1702000","1708000"," I think we've been having this similar conversation since first week of January, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1708000","1710000"," Just be careful in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1710000","1715000"," I want you guys to have some situational awareness of where the market actually is right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1715000","1721000"," And even though we recovered from the sell off down here, the real true danger that's in this market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1721000","1724000"," There is some absolute danger out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1724000","1725000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1725000","1727000"," And we've triggered this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1727000","1732000"," So this is where you say that when I say something to you like, hey, we're flashing a crash scenario."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1732000","1734000"," It's that 50 rolling over that 200."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1734000","1735000"," I mean, that's one of them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1735000","1740000"," There's more, but that move right there is setting up a capitulation move."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1740000","1743000"," And this short covering in here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1743000","1745000"," I wouldn't trust this at all."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1745000","1746000"," I'm not going to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1746000","1748000"," And I'm not going to trust this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1748000","1750000"," So somewhere in here, you should get some rejection."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1750000","1754000"," I'll trade the rest of this up with you as you move forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1754000","1755000"," I actually did."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1755000","1756000"," You know what I did yesterday?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1756000","1758000"," This is going to be because I'm blowing your minds."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1758000","1764000"," I bought some calls right in here for like $1.86 for $4.25."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1764000","1768000"," And then I fucking added more down here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1768000","1771000"," For like, I think 70 or 80 cents."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1771000","1776000"," And then down here, I would do that was so far upside down yesterday and calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1776000","1780000"," I was getting butt fucked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1781000","1785000"," So literally at like 413."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1785000","1793000"," I loaded the fucking boat trying to try into a scared shitless loaded the fucking boat"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1793000","1796000"," down here and calls because I was like, I'm already fucked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1796000","1797000"," I just lost."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1797000","1800000"," Dude, I just lost like fucking dead down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1800000","1803000"," But I want to tell you shit ton of money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1803000","1807000"," I'm like, if I don't, like my last chance here is to load the fucking boat with like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1807000","1812000"," another 5k and like dirt cheap penny calls, the only way I'm saving this trade."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1812000","1816000"," You know, I was like, at this point, I've pissed away so much cash and I haven't sold,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1816000","1817000"," I haven't sold any of this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1817000","1821000"," I'm like, I'm just going to fucking dollar cause the average and zero dates."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1821000","1825000"," And sure, then should have printed like, I don't know, something stupid."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1825000","1828000"," Like a thousand percent in the bell this morning."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1828000","1830000"," Something stupid."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1830000","1832000"," I took the money and ran here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1832000","1836000"," Now, I've been trying to get the stream up, so I haven't traded this at all today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1836000","1838000"," I haven't had a chance to trade today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1838000","1840000"," The stream still wasn't able to get up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1840000","1846000"," I had to go in and work on like, I had to work on the USBs and the power management and all"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1846000","1848000"," that kind of stupid shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1848000","1850000"," So now my camera is not freezing anymore, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1850000","1851000"," My camera is freezing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1851000","1852000"," God damn it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1852000","1855000"," So my camera is freezing for not for any bad reasons."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1855000","1859000"," It's because I haven't set my camera up on this computer yet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1859000","1860000"," So fuck my camera."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1860000","1863000"," Hopefully you guys can just hear me out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1863000","1865000"," You guys can see all this kind of cool stuff."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1865000","1870000"," So we're going to close this down right here for now for the moment and bring up some book"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1870000","1871000"," map for you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1871000","1872000"," Fuck my camera."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1872000","1874000"," So I was trying to fuck on my camera right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1874000","1878000"," And it's set to my previous set up that I had."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1878000","1880000"," So it's going to start freezing until I work."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1880000","1883000"," I have to go into the internals of the streaming platform."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1883000","1885000"," I was working on it and I was like, fuck it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1885000","1887000"," I got to get on for a live stream for them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1887000","1889000"," Secondly, he's making a prayerance today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1889000","1890000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1890000","1893000"," So we are to run the SPX right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1894000","1899000"," I brought up the time and sales along with the current order book."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1899000","1902000"," I figured you could look at the current order book and time and sales."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1902000","1903000"," I don't have to like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1903000","1904000"," We can change this out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1904000","1908000"," I've got some other stuff to bring up for you guys here to take a peek at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1908000","1911000"," I'll show you the hero indicator."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1911000","1913000"," Over time here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1913000","1915000"," Start to see that right right around here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1915000","1916000"," Starts in at 1.15."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1916000","1922000"," Start being a little bit more neutral in the in the in the in the book here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1922000","1923000"," You cannot see it all."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1923000","1924000"," So back here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1924000","1930000"," This is back at 12 40 or so 12 40 12 45."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1930000","1937000"," Starting to see a little bit of crossover in the hero indicator as we move forward, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1937000","1939000"," Starting to see it's not quite negative."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1939000","1943000"," We had a negative move here, but this is consolidation in this zone here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1943000","1947000"," If we start to trade lower, we're going to we'll end up feeling it at some point down below."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1947000","1948000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1948000","1949000"," Some distribution, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1949000","1952000"," Simulation distribution as we move forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1952000","1957000"," If you want me to do something different instead of this time and sales, this is the current"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1957000","1958000"," order book."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1958000","1959000"," This is the volume."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1959000","1962000"," I've got a trade counter quotes counter quotes Delta."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1962000","1967000"," Again, we can trade the dome, although I don't like the dome as much in this in this program."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1967000","1969000"," We can do time and sale."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1969000","1971000"," We're doing we're doing time and sales."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1971000","1972000"," We can we can add."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1972000","1973000"," I don't know right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1973000","1975000"," This is kind of spaced out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1975000","1977000"," So I'll leave it there for now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1977000","1983000"," Let me know in the comments what you think and about this set up with time and sales."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1983000","1988000"," You see this nice little little resistance kick it in here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1988000","1991000"," And we can see right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1991000","1996000"," We can see some of these sellers are in here right now trying to start selling this market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","1996000","2003000"," down at least down to where this where the support down below here is 2571."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2004000","2007000"," We'll try to see if we can spread this out a little bit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2007000","2011000"," We're going to better look at the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2011000","2016000"," Got some VWOP down here at four twenty five sixty one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2016000","2020000"," We'll look lower."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2020000","2022000"," Down here at four twenty as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2022000","2023000"," This is a nice level down here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2023000","2026000"," We talked about that for twenty this morning."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2026000","2029000"," That's where the by the fucking dippers are at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2029000","2032000"," So just keep your eyes on four twenty five fifty."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2032000","2035000"," We'll look a little bit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2035000","2041000"," Let me ever get this to do its thing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2041000","2042000"," You got nice buyers in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2042000","2048000"," This is not you got buyers here for twenty seven buyers here at four twenty six fifty."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2048000","2051000"," Let's see if we can load up a let's see if you load up multiple tickers."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2051000","2055000"," I think we can load up multiple tickers."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2055000","2058000"," Not have not have any kind of a drag."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2058000","2061000"," So you guys see already see how fast this is happening, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2061000","2067000"," So we'll see if how fast or slow that Tesla loads up and see if we get any crashing on the live stream here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2067000","2072000"," We'll look up to see how fast Tesla loaded."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2072000","2074000"," Test is loading kind of kind of quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2074000","2078000"," We'll add a connection or I am."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2078000","2081000"," Figure add-ons with the here indicator in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2081000","2082000"," Close this down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2082000","2085000"," I started to test out a nice little day today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2085000","2090000"," We'll see how long this takes to load up and see if we can actually run more than one ticker at a time without a crash."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2090000","2093000"," Like we were doing like we were having before."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2093000","2094000"," I have it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2094000","2095000"," I'm not clocking."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2095000","2097000"," I'm not I'm not I'm not clocking in the power management yet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2097000","2099000"," So I've got some tinkering to do."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2099000","2104000"," So we'll see see how this works out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2104000","2108000"," Bring this back here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2108000","2113000"," Start to see that resistance above right resistance here at eight fifty nine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2113000","2117000"," Most still sellers above at eight seventy nine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2117000","2122000"," Nine hundred right starts his volatility as he moved forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2122000","2128000"," Let's look below and see where support is sports that same old place right eight hundred."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2128000","2135000"," Nice nice big order book down here at eight hundred on on the on Tesla."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2135000","2140000"," If you want to trade these levels, you could trade this up to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2140000","2144000"," You could trade this up to eight fifty eight eighty five."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2144000","2150000"," And then pick it back up again at eight sixty eighty six and take it then to eight seventy eight ninety two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2150000","2153000"," Possibly could squeeze through this right possibly could also."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2153000","2156000"," If you're not going to trade higher than this, it would be done in futures."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2156000","2159000"," If it was to happen in eight eighty one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2159000","2162000"," Eight ninety eight sixty five."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2162000","2166000"," And then the big big nine oh three is where you roll the market over up here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2166000","2167000"," Right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2167000","2168000"," You hit nine oh one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2168000","2169000"," You're like whoo."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2169000","2170000"," Everything is great."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2170000","2172000"," I'm going to pick this seller's hiding up in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2172000","2179000"," So you probably want to pick this back up again over nine ten seventy one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2179000","2181000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2181000","2183000"," See if I can."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2183000","2188000"," I have to click to get this to roll."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2188000","2190000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2190000","2192000"," So yeah, fuck the camera for right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2192000","2198000"," I gotta I gotta I'll after the market close today I'll work on the camera so that I don't have to fuck with it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2199000","2205000"," Because I have to rebuild this every time I read every time I launch one of these fucking things."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2205000","2211000"," It's like way my hair every time I launch one of these things."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2211000","2217000"," I have to have to do what."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2217000","2220000"," What was the main display?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2220000","2222000"," Let's move it behind."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2222000","2223000"," That's better."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2223000","2225000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2226000","2230000"," So let me look at the chat real quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2230000","2233000"," That's another thing is some having problems with chat feature here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2233000","2234000"," Nope."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2234000","2235000"," Hold on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2235000","2237000"," My chat feature is not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2237000","2240000"," My chat is stuck to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2240000","2242000"," Mmm."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2242000","2245000"," Refresh the chat baby."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2245000","2247000"," See if that works."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2247000","2249000"," Nope."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2249000","2252000"," You can roll this over a little bit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2252000","2253000"," Oh, there we go."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2253000","2254000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2254000","2255000"," Now I can scroll your chat."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2255000","2256000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2256000","2259000"," So I'm going to read some of what you guys are saying up here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2259000","2262000"," I think the winner to make new bottom is closed, but I'm in that minority."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2262000","2263000"," Oh, so winky."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2263000","2269000"," You think the winner to make a new bottom is closed, but I'm in the minority."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2269000","2275000"," I think we can trade higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2276000","2279000"," I got a little spy volume was the bounce to week is fuck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2279000","2280000"," That's typical."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2280000","2281000"," We typically get good."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2281000","2285000"," Best of our best bounces is low liquidity."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2285000","2290000"," In my view, more volume actually to me is more of a bottoming effect, which is we trade down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2290000","2292000"," We'll push it down harder."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2292000","2293000"," Only got four minutes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2293000","2294000"," Save the world."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2294000","2295000"," Wheat is down 6.6 percent."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2295000","2296000"," Yikes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2296000","2297000"," Yup."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2297000","2300000"," What would you negate this depth of health scenario?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2300000","2301000"," Oh, yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2301000","2302000"," That's a good question."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2302000","2305000"," What would negate this depth of health scenario?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2305000","2306000"," And you got it from me, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2306000","2311000"," I showed you on that other on that other chart where you want to trade higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2311000","2315000"," Then let me take a look on this chart and see where you'd want to trade higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2315000","2318000"," How do you negate this great question, actually?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2318000","2320000"," Outstanding question."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2320000","2326000"," How do you negate the depth of how scenario that kick ask question, believe it or not?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2326000","2327000"," Let me look at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2327000","2328000"," Let me look at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2328000","2330000"," Yes, believe it or not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2331000","2339000"," Yes, sometimes I like SPX for the real book, but I like ES because they give the have some"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2339000","2342000"," little bit of extended moves in the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2342000","2346000"," I always like to see the move higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2346000","2349000"," Let's look at SPX."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2349000","2350000"," Oh, it's a great question."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2350000","2354000"," How do we negate the depths of health?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2354000","2356000"," Fair question."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2356000","2359000"," So hold on here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2359000","2364000"," How do we negate the depth of how?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2364000","2371000"," The first place to negate the depths of how is root and truth."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2371000","2376000"," The first step is that you trade higher."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2376000","2377000"," Mark this down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2377000","2380000"," We're going to pick itself piece of paper and pen out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2380000","2388000"," The first bullish sign is a trade higher than 4420.19 and that holds."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2389000","2392000"," That's your first first light."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2392000","2396000"," Like if you're going to crack, if you're going to crack the door, if you're like scared,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2396000","2402000"," you were like, I don't know, being tortured in a dungeon somewhere and your jailer and"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2402000","2408000"," your punisher fell asleep or left and you saw a brief hint of light that you're getting out of there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2408000","2409000"," Brief hint."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2409000","2414000"," It's closed above 4420.19 currently."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2414000","2419000"," Now, even then, you're not out of the woods yet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2419000","2423000"," You want to then see."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2423000","2429000"," Your next point of contention would roughly be."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2429000","2431000"," Yeah, you're somewhere in there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2431000","2432000"," That's where you are right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2432000","2436000"," Let's say you want to break higher than you want to consolidate, though."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2436000","2441000"," You want to consolidate then at 4423.19, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2441000","2448000"," Then you literally need to break higher than a four, five, eight, six, point, six, eight"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2448000","2449000"," somewhere in there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2449000","2451000"," So basically 4,600."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2451000","2454000"," And then that situation is negated."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2454000","2458000"," And then this is actually going to put an asterisk on this as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2458000","2464000"," If you break higher than 4412 and you start to consolidate and then we roll over there,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2464000","2466000"," you're fucked again."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2466000","2467000"," You're fucked again."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2467000","2472000"," So there's there's there's actions that could take place to roll us lower still."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2472000","2480000"," But the first the first thing you're looking for is a bull as we break higher than 4414 or so 4420."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2480000","2484000"," And then we start to at least in a minimum, start to consolidate."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2484000","2487000"," That's your first breath of fresh air."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2487000","2489000"," Otherwise."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2489000","2495000"," Otherwise, if you don't do that as a bull, if we don't do this as a market,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2495000","2499000"," we are set up for that end of the world scenario."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2499000","2500000"," And that's what it is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2500000","2503000"," You can you can fucking argue to your blue in the face."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2503000","2506000"," You can deny it to your blue in the face, but that's what it is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2506000","2509000"," That really is what it is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2509000","2512000"," You need to stop this cross from happening."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2512000","2518000"," And the and once you break above this, this previous low, this previous high,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2518000","2520000"," the real true."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2521000","2522000"," The real true."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2522000","2526000"," It's all over is a trade higher than 4600."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2526000","2529000"," That's when you can be like a bull and be like fuck being a bear."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2529000","2533000"," I'm done and putting on the bull clothes and I'm taking this all day long every day."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2533000","2535000"," And that that's a great question."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2535000","2536000"," Who ever asked that?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2536000","2538000"," I don't know who asked that now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2538000","2542000"," Sorry, I'm going through the chat right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2542000","2544000"," Paskey said we expect high inflation tomorrow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2544000","2546000"," Here we go with the mind games."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2546000","2547000"," Yeah, fuck the mind games."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2547000","2549000"," The stream is just super clear."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2549000","2552000"," It's like night and day with how to prepare before huge upgrade."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2552000","2553000"," Yeah, right on Tom."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2553000","2556000"," Yeah, I just got to take her with it at this point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2556000","2557000"," We had some problems."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2557000","2564000"," I guess when the when I first got the the the unit, it was shaken."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2564000","2568000"," And there were some there were some problems with it being shaken."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2568000","2570000"," And so they had to go back and do some repairs."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2570000","2573000"," And like I don't think I don't think that shit is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2573000","2578000"," It's like I don't know some kind of like heat shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2578000","2582000"," And then one of the boards was all fucked up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2582000","2583000"," So whatever."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2583000","2590000"," I got to get a kickstand, I guess, like I have to get a kickstand, a 3D printer kickstand"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2590000","2592000"," and prop this this thing up here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2592000","2600000"," So we'll work on that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2600000","2601000"," Let me see here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2601000","2606000"," Yeah, I don't cost it ever just into fucking zero dates."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2606000","2607000"," I did."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2607000","2608000"," I did."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2608000","2609000"," I did."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2609000","2612000"," I don't cost average than due to it was so scary."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2612000","2614000"," I was so freaked out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2614000","2617000"," I was so fucking panicked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2617000","2619000"," I didn't want to do so."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2619000","2620000"," I stopped looking at the market last night."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2620000","2623000"," I'm like, I'm just going to put this shit together and get it done."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2623000","2625000"," And I'm like, I ain't looking at futures."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2625000","2628000"," I'm like, because that could have been ultra fucked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2628000","2630000"," Ultra fucked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2630000","2632000"," Ultra fucked."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2633000","2638000"," All right, seems to be clear right on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2638000","2639000"," Yeah, yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2639000","2640000"," Got all that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2640000","2641000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2641000","2643000"," Glad to see her back."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2643000","2645000"," So yeah, it could be backstreaming, dude."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2645000","2646000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2646000","2650000"," So what do you guys want me to do for you right now?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2650000","2651000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2651000","2652000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2652000","2653000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2653000","2656000"," You can't don't be shipping PCs ever."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2656000","2661000"," And if you're transporting them, you want to be the one handling them like your hands on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2661000","2666000"," the PC holding it in your lap or just don't put it together and you put it together when"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2666000","2667000"," you get ahead."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2667000","2673000"," I had somebody build this for me and a fucking stupid."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2673000","2674000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2674000","2675000"," So do you want me to look up?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2675000","2676000"," Give me."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2676000","2677000"," How about this?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2677000","2678000"," I haven't done for a while."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2678000","2680000"," Why don't you guys give me some tickers that you want to see?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2680000","2683000"," You guys can see here that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2683000","2684000"," Miss."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2684000","2685000"," Mary hit down here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2685000","2687000"," This four, two, five, seven, five."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2687000","2689000"," We'll see if we can catch a bounce here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2690000","2695000"," If we start to trade it down, we'll look for if the rug gets pulled or not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2695000","2699000"," We'll revisit spy here in a minute and see if we get."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2699000","2702000"," We'll see if we get the rug pull."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2702000","2703000"," Where's that?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2703000","2704000"," What's that number down here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2704000","2708000"," We're looking at four, two, five, seven, two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2708000","2709000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2709000","2711000"," I got fucking bears."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2711000","2715000"," They're like, Oh, I'm so short right now to four, five, seven, two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2715000","2717000"," I know the bears are all quiet."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2717000","2721000"," They'll pay attention to this podcast and be like, well, this stream be like, Oh, I'm"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2721000","2722000"," so fucking short right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2722000","2726000"," We're just talking about going down to four, two, five, seven, seven, zero."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2726000","2729000"," And we'll see if this holds or if we get a rug pull."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2729000","2732000"," I don't like not seeing more of this book over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2732000","2737000"," I kind of want this book to be a little bit larger so I can see the numbers."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2737000","2739000"," I don't like seeing it so low."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2739000","2742000"," We're going to have to talk about this over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2742000","2744000"," I'm not sure I'm I'm not sure I'm down with this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2744000","2746000"," We're just looking at here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2746000","2749000"," Price, the size, the time, time side price."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2749000","2751000"," You probably don't need that, do we?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2751000","2752000"," We don't need that there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2752000","2755000"," See if we can scoot scootch this over."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2755000","2757000"," I don't think we can work on this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2757000","2759000"," I don't like to get this book."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2759000","2763000"," I don't like it's showing like 2,500 buys and 2,600."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2763000","2766000"," Kind of like seeing the 50,000 not the 25,000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2766000","2769000"," I don't know the sense that it's shown right now, but whatever."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2769000","2770000"," We'll come to it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2770000","2771000"," We'll get back to it here in a minute."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2771000","2772000"," So."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2772000","2774000"," We'll work on this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2774000","2777000"," What was the more you guys asking for here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2777000","2780000"," You guys are asking for me to pull up charts."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2780000","2782000"," Oh, trade the news."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2782000","2785000"," Okay, we'll talk about trade the news here in just a minute."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2785000","2789000"," I just had a fight with trade the news this morning."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2789000","2791000"," I had a giant email fight with trade the news."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2791000","2797000"," I might be switching my news provider just because I'm pissed off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2797000","2800000"," There's a couple others out there that are using the pass that are pretty good."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2800000","2801000"," I think I might switch."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2801000","2803000"," I'm a little fucking pissy right now with trade the news."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2803000","2808000"," And I don't want to get into it publicly because I don't want to disparage them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2808000","2810000"," But I got into one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2810000","2813000"," I had sent an email a week or two ago."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2813000","2817000"," And then this morning I got an email back and the guy was like, go fuck yourself."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2817000","2819000"," And I was like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2819000","2821000"," So I'm like, okay, I can go fuck myself."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2821000","2824000"," I'm like, I'm going to go fuck myself right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2824000","2825000"," Watch."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2825000","2828000"," And so I got to do a few things and deal with them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2828000","2835000"," So in the meantime, what I'll do is I'll put up a different news source for us here in just a few minutes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2835000","2836000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2836000","2838000"," I'll get a news source up for you guys."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2838000","2839000"," But I just had a big blow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2839000","2840000"," I'll fight with him."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2840000","2842000"," Has been going on for a couple of days now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2842000","2844000"," Let's see."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2844000","2846000"," Look at CL."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2846000","2847000"," Yes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2847000","2851000"," I did the same thing the day when I actually bought a hundred calls of clothes instead of 10."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2851000","2852000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2852000","2853000"," Yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2853000","2854000"," We can look at flow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2854000","2855000"," I'll go right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2855000","2857000"," I can run all kinds of shit now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2857000","2859000"," Like this thing's a beast."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2859000","2861000"," Hold on a second here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2861000","2862000"," We just a second."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2862000","2864000"," I'll bring up flow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2864000","2865000"," I'll go."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2865000","2867000"," We'll roll through real quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2867000","2869000"," Or you know what I had?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2869000","2870000"," It was having problems."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2870000","2873000"," I tried to log in."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2873000","2875000"," It said that I was having a."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2875000","2877000"," I was having some weird problems."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2877000","2883000"," It says I've got an authenticity to the authentication problem."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2884000","2885000"," Please contact support."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2885000","2887000"," I don't know what that means."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2887000","2888000"," So I'll read them off to you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2888000","2889000"," I've got them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2889000","2890000"," I have an instance of it running."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2890000","2894000"," I'm going to run this inside the discord for you guys live."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2894000","2895000"," Every day."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2895000","2899000"," So I've got some spy puts coming in March 9th, 426 P."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2899000","2901000"," $64,000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2901000","2904000"," See if you can see anything else."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2904000","2907000"," A spy calls came in at 136."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2907000","2912000"," Three racks of them March 11th, 428 and 429 C."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2913000","2915000"," Uber calls, baby."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2915000","2918000"," Uber May 20th."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2918000","2920000"," 30 C 3.3 million."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2920000","2922000"," That's my that's my same uber guy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2922000","2925000"," That's my uber guy that's been loading the fucking boat on uber calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2925000","2928000"," As a matter of fact, that's where my uber calls ours in May."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2928000","2930000"," And that's pretty neat because."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2930000","2934000"," I have uber calls for May 20th and."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2934000","2940000"," If this guy I remember I talked about when you're buying golden tickets to go a month later."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2940000","2945000"," And they'll keep rolling that position to a further out date."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2945000","2948000"," And sure enough, so this this is probably a good trade."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2948000","2952000"," My my trades probably still good at this point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2952000","2958000"," That's all I'm seeing right now on on Flow Algo."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2958000","2961000"," The ISP ISP is banging today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2961000","2963000"," ISP is super banging my my connection."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2963000","2966000"," I'm not getting strangled."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2966000","2969000"," Everything is banging."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2969000","2974000"," How unbearable is bill Ackman during this war tweeting non stop."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2974000","2977000"," Yeah, he can go fuck himself too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2977000","2979000"," Yeah, of course he does."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2979000","2980000"," Of course he has a position there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2980000","2982000"," He's pushing fuck bill Ackman."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2982000","2985000"," He's a he's a fucking douche."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2985000","2986000"," He is good."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2986000","2987000"," Come on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2987000","2991000"," I mean, I like some of his plays and shit, but you can't say he's not a fucking douche, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2991000","2995000"," Even if you like bill Ackman, you know, he's a fucking douche."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2996000","2997000"," Right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2997000","2999000"," He's still a fucking douche."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","2999000","3003000"," All right, so I'll bring up I'll bring up a rig for you real quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3003000","3004000"," I agree."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3004000","3005000"," He's a fucking douche."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3005000","3007000"," We can all agree that bill Ackman's a douche."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3007000","3013000"," You know the you don't bill Ackman's that guy that you know that bill Ackman is that guy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3013000","3015000"," That he's a douche bag."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3015000","3017000"," He ain't going to be a friend."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3017000","3019000"," You met me if you met him somewhere."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3019000","3022000"," Look at that beautiful little bounce down below in the spine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3023000","3028000"," We'll look at rig and then we'll bring up oil and we'll bring up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3028000","3031000"," I can't bring up CL because that's odd."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3031000","3036000"," I don't think I can, but I'll try."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3036000","3037000"," What's a good safe spread?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3037000","3038000"," We'll talk about that in a moment."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3038000","3039000"," Test up for four."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3039000","3043000"," Looks like 850 pin just increased resolution of the monitor."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3043000","3044000"," Yeah, I got to work."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3044000","3046000"," I got to work on the monitor."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3046000","3048000"," My monitor is all fucked up too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3048000","3050000"," I even switched out the monitors."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3051000","3053000"," I'll talk about that later."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3053000","3054000"," Kareem uber."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3054000","3055000"," That's that same bull."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3055000","3056000"," That's that same whale."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3056000","3058000"," That same will keeps buying those calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3058000","3064000"," He just keeps loading the fucking boat on those on those uber calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3064000","3067000"," That's like the second time he's done it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3067000","3068000"," All right."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3068000","3069000"," So we'll look at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3069000","3070000"," Let's look at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3070000","3072000"," Let's look at rig."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3072000","3074000"," Not really seeing a lot on rig."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3074000","3077000"," Sitting on some support here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3078000","3084000"," We know that the four third four three eight four three eight would be the next stop for rig."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3084000","3087000"," You know that rig is news driven to an extent."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3087000","3091000"," Some nice support here down at four five four five four."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3091000","3094000"," Another stop at four two seven."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3094000","3099000"," Four zero one and then three eight two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3099000","3102000"," You know, I don't know what to say about rig right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3102000","3107000"," I want to say that it's it's definitely going to be driven by new or it was well, I don't"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3107000","3108000"," know."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3108000","3110000"," It was driven by fake news."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3110000","3114000"," I'll say that it was driven by fake news."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3114000","3116000"," We've got more sellers than buyers currently."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3116000","3120000"," Looks just like profit taking on rig."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3120000","3123000"," We've talked about that in previous podcast and live streams."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3123000","3125000"," I'll talk about it again about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3125000","3131000"," I want to talk to you guys at some point about war and is there impact in the markets or"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3131000","3132000"," not?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3132000","3138560"," Is it used as an excuse to dump the market at key levels or raise the market up at key"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3138560","3145520"," levels and how it's used, how if you go back and look at all of our wars that there really"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3145520","3150120"," isn't too much correlation, it's just the it's just the hot topic that's used to dump"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3150120","3152800"," the market."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3152800","3156960"," And there's some other things that play too, which would be we can we can go and we can"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3156960","3160400"," look at oil going back to March 2020."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3160400","3165800"," And you can you can see right there back in March 2020 that the fair selling and oil."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3165800","3167480"," And then that's the newest trade, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3167480","3168840"," It never came back."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3168840","3170600"," Of course, it's going to come back at some point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3170600","3175160"," And of course, the equity market is oversold or overbought."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3175160","3176360"," So what do you do?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3176360","3179520"," You remove your money from the equity market, you put it into the oil market, trade that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3179520","3182400"," up, find yourself some good fucking news."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3182400","3187800"," And as a matter of fact, it's not shocking to me at all to see Russia invade or pick"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3187800","3192680"," this time to invade because it lines right up for commodities, which they have and can"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3192680","3195360"," make a lot of money off of going up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3195360","3198920"," So I think that part of this, believe it or not, when you talk about rich people making"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3198920","3201920"," money off of war, this is no different."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3201920","3202920"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3202920","3205280"," So we're going to get rid of rig now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3205280","3209400"," Well, I think the other day I was talking about trying to try and to do a live stream"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3209400","3215160"," or a video on that topic specifically because it's kind of a disgusting topic to talk about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3215160","3217080"," It's kind of it's kind of a gross topic."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3217080","3219080"," It's not a good topic to talk about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3219080","3221600"," Let me see here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3221600","3225360"," Got the pandemic is saying that we'll reach 4,000 and spy by mid next week."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3225360","3227000"," What do you think of him?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3227000","3228000"," Don't know."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3228000","3229480"," I think I know who he is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3229480","3231240"," There's a couple pandas out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3231240","3233520"," I think there's a couple of pandas out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3233520","3234520"," I don't follow those guys."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3234520","3236960"," I see them in my feeds every once in a while."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3236960","3241640"," They'll pop up in my feed and you know, to each the road and you guys all trade what"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3241640","3243440"," you want to trade out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3244440","3248040"," I don't think you know, the thing about like, let's see, we so I don't think it's a matter"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3248040","3251160"," of, hey, do we trade to 4,000 or not?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3251160","3256080"," I think it's a matter of managing your positions and that you trade to the right always."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3256080","3261000"," So but I won't, but you do want to be aware of the threat below and you want to be aware"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3261000","3264080"," of how you trade above, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3264080","3269920"," So that when we encounter those zones, encounter support and resistance that you can take a"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3269920","3271520"," measure and approach, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3271520","3275760"," If we're approaching resistance, you're going to take some money off the table, some profit,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3275760","3276760"," right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3276760","3281000"," And then you're going, if you're like, hey, I want to trade through this volatility,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3281000","3284040"," you can do that, but you still have to put some protection on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3284040","3288080"," If you didn't want to put protection on, then you have to wait until we get above that resistance."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3288080","3289400"," It becomes support."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3289400","3295320"," And then you can trade more freely, right, without any kind of protection on to that next"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3295320","3296320"," resistance level."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3297160","3302640"," And if we get rejected here, you want to have had some protection on, I mean, so I don't"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3302640","3303640"," know."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3303640","3304640"," He doesn't know."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3304640","3309800"," Nobody knows if we trade down to 4,000 or if we trade up to all time highs, nobody has"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3309800","3310800"," that answer."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3310800","3316960"," But we do have an easy way to find out or an easy way to measure how much risk we put"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3316960","3321840"," on, depending on where we are, as a matter of fact, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3321840","3326960"," As a prime example, yesterday when I was losing all my fucking money in the belly"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3326960","3332800"," yesterday, the one reason why I kept adding into that bell was because I looked at the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3332800","3337840"," entire market and said, well, we're oversold to a point where I don't want to lose all"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3337840","3339840"," of this money I've spent."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3339840","3346560"," And I know if I just add another 5 or 10% because it's so dirt fucking cheap that I don't want"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3346560","3352200"," to lose, you know, I don't want to lose this huge bankroll and then we wake up tomorrow"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3352200","3357320"," and we've recovered and because I didn't spend another 5 grand, right, I don't want"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3357320","3362800"," to lose 30, 40, 50 grand and because I didn't spend another 5 now, there was a high chance"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3362800","3369000"," that we were going to limit down overnight and I could lose, you know, some real big coin."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3369000","3377320"," But at the same time that we could have limited down, we were oversold and let's say I just"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3377320","3379640"," cut my position, I would have been fucked today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3379640","3383800"," So I went back in with a little bit more, okay, and that's the same thing where we are in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3383800","3384800"," this resistance zone."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3384800","3389600"," You can start getting short here and you can get more aggressive as we go higher, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3389600","3392800"," If you're a bear, you're going to be like, hey, you know, like I'm going to get in with"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3392800","3397880"," some of the money put spreads and as we start, if we start breaking through, it's going"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3397880","3404680"," to become a short position and then it's going to become a monthly puts and it's just"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3404680","3407560"," going to go naked zero days if we get to 440, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3407560","3411040"," Just buying zero day puts and just throwing money at the fucking fire because you know"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3411040","3414600"," it's going to roll over at some point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3414600","3415600"," That's the same thing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3415600","3417080"," Same thing as what happened yesterday."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3417080","3422240"," And, as a matter of fact, had I had a burned yesterday, had we opened with a limit down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3422240","3429080"," today, my next move because I lost all that money would be to buy zero dates right away"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3429080","3430080"," calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3430080","3434440"," I'm not maybe not right away, probably made me write the bill a little bit and then a whole"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3434440","3438280"," bunch more by like 10 o'clock, 12 o'clock in the afternoon."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3438280","3443440"," But I would have to make that money back, which is a big thing that traders and investors"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3443440","3449040"," have problems with is, I made that post on Twitter yesterday, I want you to be aware that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3449040","3453920"," if you're a bull and we start limiting down to not panic and sell because of where we"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3453920","3456880"," are, you just kind of have to hold on at that point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3456880","3460960"," And then another another long or another thing you have to learn as a trader and investor"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3460960","3468320"," is that if you get knocked off your horse, oftentimes it's at a point where it's going"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3468320","3469320"," to reverse."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3469320","3475640"," Oftentimes it's a point where if you go deeper in, you actually do make your money back and"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3475640","3477840"," then some in huge profit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3477920","3484480"," Oftentimes it happens for new investors, new traders is your capitulation points and you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3484480","3488480"," capitulate, you lose all your cash, and then you're actually wounded and you say, I'm not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3488480","3492080"," going to buy even if we turn around tomorrow, I'm not going to buy, you just kind of in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3492080","3496280"," this like, no, no, no, and then the move happens, then you're kind of out of fucking pocket"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3496280","3500160"," and then your time and your trade's wrong, it's like, it's all fucked up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3500160","3501160"," That's just a matter of time."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3501160","3507000"," You do that shit long enough and you miss reversals long enough up and down and eventually it's"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3507000","3510880"," like a fucking hammer in your head and you're like, I'm sick and tired of losing money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3510880","3513800"," That's all I got for you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3513800","3517040"," So there's a nice hair bounce here on the spy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3517040","3521640"," We'll look a little bit lower and see if we get how many more levels down below."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3521640","3522640"," This doesn't look too bad."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3522640","3523640"," I like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3523640","3524640"," I like this here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3524640","3527480"," I mean, it's not, I don't think we're going down here to 420 currently."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3527480","3529560"," I don't think we are."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3529560","3532000"," We still have some sellers above here at 429."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3532000","3536680"," You can see these sellers see that yellow line just kicked in right there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3536680","3539920"," You know that there's sellers there, so how do we get past this?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3539920","3542680"," The only question that you have, this is, there's a couple of things."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3542680","3547520"," If you're a bear and you want to take a real, a real short position or a long put position,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3547520","3550440"," you're probably going to wait for the close, not guaranteed, but you're probably going"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3550440","3554280"," to be waiting for the close because what they'll do is they'll squeeze you out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3554280","3555280"," They'll max paying your ass."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3555280","3559080"," You'll buy puts here, like real puts or real shorts."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3559080","3563760"," Like I'm going to hold these in the next, next week or some, probably want to wait, not guaranteed,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3563760","3569400"," but oftentimes you wait for near the bell, you wait until 4 or 15 and then you grab"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3569400","3572000"," a nice, a nice in the money, a short position."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3572000","3577840"," If we gap up, you can add, add again tomorrow, get more aggressive."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3577840","3578960"," So then that's what I'll be doing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3578960","3582960"," So, uh, we're currently, I'm, I'm not actively day trading today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3582960","3585440"," Uh, I sold all my shit this morning."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3585440","3587200"," So I was working on this bullshit here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3587200","3591840"," So what I'm going to be looking for, what am I looking for into the bell and I'm going"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3591840","3596480"," to be looking for us to be moving up and all honesty, I'm looking for a move up into"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3596480","3604320"," the bell and my next trade is going to be maybe some zero dates from the bell, possibly some"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3604320","3605320"," calls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3605320","3611000"," Uh, and in reality, I'm going to be setting up a trade to take on some, uh, put spreads,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3611000","3616640"," uh, for that I'm going to expire probably the 18th or later in the money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3616640","3621000"," So if I can get some, I like 430 again, I had, I had some 430s last time."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3621000","3625640"," If I get some, like some 430s or something, if I pick those spreads up into the bell,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3625640","3631560"," what I'll do is I'll also grab some zero day calls, uh, as a married trade, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3631560","3636480"," So I'll get some zero day calls that are dirt cheap and or one day or two dates or whatever"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3636480","3641480"," Fridays or Mondays and, uh, although I think we trade sideways tomorrow, probably probably"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3641480","3647080"," going to consolidate, um, or have some weakness consolidation, maybe tomorrow, but I want"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3647080","3649360"," to see if this trades going to go forward."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3649360","3654080"," And then if we fucking fail, if we start burning it down, um, I'm not out of pocket."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3654080","3656440"," I haven't lost a fucking scent."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3656440","3660600"," If we start selling on those zero dates because I've got those put spreads and I have some"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3660600","3666880"," firm faith that if not today, if not, uh, if not, when, when is the, uh, you can see"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3666880","3673040"," here, I have some faith that between now and the 15th and 16th, there's going to be some"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3673040","3677840"," weakness in the market at some point, uh, have some firm faith there that, uh, that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3677840","3681600"," will be, will revisit for 30 at some point, but I'm not going to give it like a hundred"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3681600","3682600"," percent."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3682600","3689080"," Uh, but I'll give it like an 80% chance we're going to revisit for 30 give it 80% 80% that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3689080","3693000"," we revisit for 30 by FOMC."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3693000","3700520"," And if not, we'll revisit it, uh, during, uh, quad-witching and further, uh, a real strong"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3700520","3704720"," move up probably probably won't happen until even after the quad-witching, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3704720","3706480"," You know, normally it takes a few days."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3706480","3711120"," You won't see the move until after the, uh, after the quad, you'll see like that Monday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3711120","3715720"," or Wednesday or Friday of the following week, not always, but sometimes it waits, it burns"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3715720","3719760"," everybody down and you kill all the bull hairs, you kill all the bulls and they, they kind"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3719760","3723520"," of do a flush of everyone's position."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3723520","3729600"," Uh, now, uh, I'm not, so that doesn't even account for, are we going to see 400?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3729600","3732280"," I would get more aggressive if we start trading below 430, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3732280","3736600"," If we were able to trade higher than 430 and we start to come back down and revisit it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3736600","3737600"," We start trading through it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3737600","3740000"," I'll add, I'll add more, uh, puts on at that point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3740000","3741000"," Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3741000","3753480"," Hey, S.A. just sent a, uh, token sent via PayPal, uh, right on S.A. I appreciate it,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3753480","3754480"," man."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3754480","3755480"," I'll check."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3755480","3761120"," So Friday's cap, uh, stream, I will, uh, I will, uh, I will give, I'm going to do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3761120","3765520"," a thank you for all you guys are going to drink a whiskey together and, uh, we'll do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3765520","3768920"," some celebrating because you guys are the one, you guys are the ones supporting this"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","3784640","3788400"," So what you guys can do as much thought was you could go into a voice channel and discord"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3788400","3793160"," open a small window with, with, uh, the live stream of flow, I'll go going."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3793160","3797120"," You can watch this stream here and you can get me, you'll get me, have the ability to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3797120","3803320"," be able to, uh, flip back and forth and, uh, show you guys charts against a book map and"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3803320","3804320"," that kind of stuff."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3804320","3809880"," So this live stream is more of a test, uh, and it's, it's basically working right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3809880","3810880"," It can be bad."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3810880","3811880"," It's gonna be better."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3811880","3814760"," I have some work to do on the cameras and I got some work to do with, uh, what I'm going"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","3814760","3817400"," to do, have going on here in the background."

"KwoWW8RhjI4","4210840","4214840"," And I think, yeah, it's probably his IT department, or it's probably his."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4214840","4218840"," Yeah, I have my deposit book map over here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4218840","4219840"," It's back to being on pause."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4219840","4220840"," I forgot it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4220840","4221840"," I apologize for that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4221840","4223840"," So right down in here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4224840","4225840"," Four twenty five, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4225840","4230840"," One bounce, two bounces."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4230840","4234840"," I need to get this fucking mic remounted too, because I'm, I'm cocking my head all the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4234840","4235840"," time."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4235840","4238840"," And it's, it's, I got to mount that tonight."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4238840","4247840"," I'm going to mount a mic tonight."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4247840","4249840"," Yeah, I don't normally respond to DMS."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4250840","4253840"," You guys, you guys, I have to understand that, like, so I have my DMS."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4253840","4257840"," It's like emails constantly, notifications constantly, interaction, constantly."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4257840","4259840"," So I'm like trying my best."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4259840","4264840"," And oftentimes I don't have direct, like, look at access to DMS."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4264840","4269840"," And so now that I'm able to run this setup, I'll be able to at least see what you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4269840","4273840"," guys are asking in real time rather than, because right now what I have to do, or"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4273840","4276840"," before today, what I have to do is I would have to, like, go into my notifications,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4276840","4280840"," then I would have to go into DMS for both counts."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4280840","4282840"," Then I would go into Discord."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4282840","4284840"," And then I'm also interacting on YouTube."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4284840","4290840"," And so with this new setup, I should be able to at least interact with critical"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4290840","4296840"," questions that you guys have, things that I can actually respond to, at least when"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4296840","4297840"," I'm on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4297840","4299840"," I wasn't able to do that before."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4299840","4301840"," There's that too much shit going on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4301840","4304840"," They got my own trading platform going on over here as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4305840","4309840"," So I'm going to take a look here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4309840","4314840"," Two, 13."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4317840","4324840"," Watching ask you, cue call or ask you, cue, cue calls March 11th, 46 C."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4325840","4335840"," Let me see if I can, oh, okay, hold on a second here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4335840","4337840"," Can I add?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4337840","4341840"," Can I add another account here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4341840","4353840"," See, this word is because, oh, it's weird because, um, if I, so if I had, um,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4353840","4356840"," well, I can turn this off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4356840","4358840"," So the problem here is this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4358840","4361840"," So you guys know, okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4361840","4364840"," If I link on tweet deck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4364840","4374840"," Both of my, if I link on tweet deck, both of my."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4374840","4378840"," If I will link on tweet deck, both of my accounts."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4379840","4389840"," Then if ever get banned from Twitter, they'll, uh, if once you link them in tweet deck,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4389840","4394840"," then they know, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4394840","4397840"," They kind of fucking know who you are."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4397840","4399840"," So I try to keep them separate."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4399840","4404840"," All right, so we got going on here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4405840","4409840"," McDonald's is, McDonald says quitting Russia to cost $50 million a month."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4409840","4413840"," I'll read, I'm going to read the news to you guys today. Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4413840","4417840"," Uh, so as the news comes out, I'll read it to you as it, as it's released."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4417840","4424840"," And then I'll have the verbal news backup for you guys tomorrow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4424840","4426840"," I'll try to read it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4426840","4429840"," As, as we trade forward here, I'll try to read to you guys."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4429840","4437840"," If I say anything in particular."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4437840","4439840"," So let me know in the chat."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4439840","4443840"," Uh,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4443840","4449840"," Look, Matt, pause. Yeah, that's me."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4449840","4451840"," Can I see the stream on stream lab?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4451840","4456840"," But can I see the stream on stream labs? Yeah, it's not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4456840","4461840"," Yeah, it's not pause anymore. Is it?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4461840","4465840"," Discord help. Uh, probably his mom was disconnected from the intro."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4465840","4467840"," Okay. We missed all that shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4467840","4472840"," NF QE is today question mark and CPI tomorrow yikes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4472840","4475840"," If CPI moves the market, the market is really stupid."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4475840","4477840"," Yeah, two good points."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4477840","4483840"," Earlier I went to, I wanted to go over the economic calendar with you guys for tomorrow."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4484840","4489840"," But the, the market doesn't care as much about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4489840","4495840"," But, you know, the market, well, it does. The market does care as much about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4495840","4502840"," Um, it does care as much. It actually does care about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4502840","4505840"," Uh, the numbers that are coming up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4506840","4515840"," And, but it uses bullshit news for why it sells off here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4515840","4524840"," Let me see. Let me just take a peek here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4524840","4530840"," Keep our eyes in the prize down here. We're still looking at this view up down here at 42557."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4531840","4537840"," We'll see if we get our third tap or if we start to break through and look for lower number, lower numbers here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4537840","4555840"," So we've got."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4555840","4557840"," Yeah, one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4557840","4558840"," We got two."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4558840","4561840"," We got three, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4561840","4566840"," And we talked about how deep do we sell down if we break through here? We looked at it earlier, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4566840","4571840"," Start to break down below 42550. This is your."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4571840","4573840"," Oh, shit moment down here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4573840","4577840"," And the next support level is 420. Okay."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4577840","4581840"," Keep that in mind 420 down below."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4581840","4584840"," You don't want to break below."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4585840","4591840"," 42550."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4597840","4603840"," I'm going to move this down over here for myself as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4603840","4606840"," You want to see a bounce off of here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4607840","4612840"," Sometimes you can trade. You can trade under it slightly and then get a reaction."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4612840","4617840"," But if you don't get a reaction down here at 42550, if you see this book,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4617840","4623840"," perfect. I'm going to change this. I don't like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4623840","4631840"," I don't like in this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4631840","4637840"," Hold on here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4637840","4643840"," Some reason this like even this right here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4643840","4646840"," Why is this?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4646840","4655840"," Forget how to do this. There it is. There it is. I always forget how to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4655840","4667840"," Somewhere in there like this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4667840","4676840"," I got to change this. That's current order book."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4676840","4681840"," I have to adjust what it's showing in the order book."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4681840","4689840"," I have to work on this."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4689840","4693840"," Somewhere down. How do I expand this? Oh, no."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4693840","4697840"," One here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4697840","4703840"," Just a second."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4703840","4709840"," I need this to be showing up more. This 51,000."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4709840","4716840"," I'll work on this tonight."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4734840","4741840"," Watching this cross down below here into neutral territory."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4741840","4767840"," Let me know in the chat if you think that if you think I want to know what you guys"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4767840","4777840"," think about, let me turn some of this off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4777840","4786840"," Let me know in the chat if you think that we're going to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4786840","4791840"," Keep that in mind right there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4791840","4799840"," That's the by the fucking dip."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4799840","4814840"," Turn this off."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4814840","4819840"," We've got March 9th. This is for today. I'm looking at some options for today, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4819840","4825840"," So March 9th. 420. 420 P."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4825840","4830840"," There's 200,000 contracts."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4830840","4835840"," Those are eight cents a piece. We got a murder those."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4835840","4840840"," They got paid yesterday. Fuck those put those put holders."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4840840","4842840"," They got paid."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4842840","4846840"," They deserve nothing today to go to zero."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4846840","4849840"," Those contracts are trade to zero."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4849840","4851840"," There's 200,000 of those out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4851840","4855840"," There's your, hey, do we sell it down moment?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4855840","4861840"," If you're a bear, if you're uber, super duper bearish."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4861840","4864840"," 420 P is expiring today or eight cents."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4864840","4868840"," If you think we're going to trade it down, we're going to we're going to lose it here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4868840","4872840"," There are only eight pennies. They're dirt cheap."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4872840","4882840"," If you're a bull on March 11th, there's still 90,000 contracts on 420 P."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4882840","4887840"," Probably because the anticipation of us trading sideways might that be of expectation"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4887840","4891840"," that we trade sideways or down into Friday."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4891840","4896840"," Those are, those are only $2.14."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4896840","4903840"," For Friday, right? If you're like, oh, I want to buy calls for Friday on a gap up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4903840","4907840"," They're still expensive."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4907840","4913840"," Four forties are off the table. Those only 41 cents. No one believes are going to four 40."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4913840","4918840"," Four thirties are three dollars right now. Those are kind of pricey."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4918840","4921840"," I think those are overpriced for a Friday expiry."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4921840","4924840"," I think they have nothing but to do but go down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4924840","4927840"," Matter of fact, they're three dollars right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4927840","4932840"," I'm betting that they go down. I'm betting by Friday or Thursday."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4932840","4936840"," I bet they're like fucking 60 cents or some at some point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4936840","4942840"," They're pricey right now. They're three dollars."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4942840","4947840"," So you're going to pay to play on four thirties for the 11th."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4948840","4953840"," On the ninth for four thirties, they're only 28, 29 cents."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4953840","4958840"," 30 cents, 28 cents for four thirties sees for today."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4958840","4964840"," I think we're, I'm going to have to guess we're going to be weak."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4964840","4972840"," Got a four 25, maybe four, maybe four 22 50 or so."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4972840","4975840"," And then we could rip it into the clothes."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4976840","4978840"," We'll see."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4978840","4988840"," But four 20 four 20 P's are eight cents. They're dirt cheap dirt cheap dirt cheap right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4988840","4995840"," Dirt cheap might be worth buying those, even if you lose them."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","4995840","4997840"," It's just a gamble."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5006840","5020840"," Yeah, you know, like the let's talk about wheat real quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5020840","5022840"," Wheat's kind of a weird thing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5022840","5028840"," Like the word thing about weed is like, they're like, well, Russia exports 70% of their exports are weed."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5028840","5034840"," I'm like, fuck, fuck that. Like Canada and the US could produce shit tons of wheat."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5034840","5039840"," My family ranches and they also plant lots of crops too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5039840","5042840"," And they rotate crops in and out."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5042840","5045840"," But there's no demand for wheat."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5045840","5049840"," I bet China would step in for wheat production as well."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5049840","5053840"," I think most of this has to do with how cheap commodities are."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5053840","5055840"," All in all honesty."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5055840","5059840"," I think the fear that's been stoked, stoked up as bullshit to make money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5060840","5064840"," I think, you know, it's interesting the EC or any CB, but the year."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5064840","5068840"," So the EU, I think, said they were going to do price controls."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5075840","5079840"," No, I'm not going to get into the way that's good or bad or not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5081840","5086840"," Whether price controls are good or bad, but it's it's hard rare that they do that in the United States."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5086840","5090840"," You've only had a few instances of that in the United States, but you can't say right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5091840","5092840"," It's like some."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5092840","5096840"," There's there's yeah, like the price of oil was fucking low."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5096840","5097840"," It was it has to come up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5097840","5099840"," You can't have oil that goddamn."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5099840","5105840"," I shouldn't be saying goddamn, but you can't have oil that cheap as it was, especially when there's demand."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5105840","5107840"," Yeah, they have to make money at some point."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5107840","5113840"," It's really where really wasn't that expect or that or was it was dirt cheap as my point, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5114840","5123840"," And then you've got a real inflation out there, but then there's this part of the market, but the economy is part of businesses that are price gouging."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5126840","5134840"," And so I so part of me is like, yeah, you know, like, like, I just I just read an article. I would Joe don't have turned me on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5135840","5137840"," And I'm reading articles where."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5137840","5142840"," The dealerships are saying, well, we don't want to we don't want to cheap in our product."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5142840","5148840"," So we're going to we're going to tighten our production at this point, even if shortages are released."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5148840","5154840"," So what their point is, well, shortages, we were able to mark up a truck for an extra 20 grand."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5154840","5156840"," We like that money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5156840","5158840"," We like not having products sitting on a lot."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5158840","5160840"," We don't we don't want you to be able to negotiate."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5160840","5166840"," So what we're going to do is we're going to fucking nail you with another 20 grand and we're going to make shortages a thing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5166840","5176840"," So they're they're artificially fucking you, right? Because they can and because they're fucking assholes and they because they're scumbags and they're not the only scumbags out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5176840","5178840"," You know that there's going to be scumbags out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5178840","5184840"," You know that there's scumbags out there with shipping, right? You know that there's all layers of shipping."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5184840","5194840"," Now I love unions and all that, but you know that we we we have bottlenecks and most what company wants wants to see a bottleneck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5195840","5197840"," Improve like what fucking company."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5198840","5206840"," That's able to charge, you know, $30,000 for a container, $40,000 for a container where they were getting like three grand or something."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5206840","5210840"," Some kind of nonsense prior to, of course, they're going to make make more shortages."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5210840","5213840"," They're going to they're going to squeeze it for everything that it's worth."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5213840","5215840"," Everyone would you would too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5215840","5220840"," If you started making an extra 300% a month or an extra 1000% a month."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5220840","5225840"," Not until you're you're pulled from that titty of money, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5225840","5226840"," Kicking and dragging."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5227840","5230840"," Is are things going to change? And so how does that change?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5230840","5233840"," Well, if the government doesn't do it, then it has to be some other guy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5233840","5237840"," That's like, well, shit, I'm going to start buying tankers or shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5237840","5239840"," I'm going to start buying trucks or shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5239840","5241840"," I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5241840","5245840"," Parts that you can't do. You can't fuck with ports to an extent, but."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5245840","5249840"," And so in some inflation doesn't ever go away. We already know that, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5251840","5255840"," That's a good point, Winky without without a doubt."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5255840","5261840"," The Tesla drivers eat soy. I did. I did find it hilarious."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5261840","5265840"," I did find it hilarious with a."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5265840","5270840"," I did find it hilarious about Tesla this week with Elon Musk because."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5270840","5272840"," Elon Musk is like."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5272840","5276840"," I always have these conversations for like a month or two or three months."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5276840","5280840"," I'm always trying to talk to always scratching my head because I'm like."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5280840","5285840"," I'm like, man, it's a really weird marriage between a lot of Tesla gang and Elon Musk,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5285840","5286840"," of course."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5286840","5288840"," They don't always meet meat."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5288840","5289840"," I'd."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5289840","5294840"," But what I always find even more bizarre was like for your your stereotypical,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5294840","5296840"," like all American mail."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5296840","5301840"," Who's like fucking V and I won't be doing my gas guzzling truck and I want five"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5301840","5303840"," months to go and dirt dirt dirt."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5303840","5306840"," I'm like, I'm so surprised these guys don't like Elon Musk."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5306840","5310840"," I'm like, Elon Musk is more like those fucking guys in a lot of ways than a lot"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5310840","5311840"," of Tesla gang."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5311840","5313840"," And of course, no one wants to believe that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5313840","5318840"," And he's telling you to pump for fucking oil and put the gas on rightfully so because"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5318840","5319840"," you do you have to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5319840","5321840"," Well, you don't have to, but."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5321840","5324840"," You don't really need to turn pipelines on."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5324840","5327840"," You need these oil companies to do some shit, which they're not going to do because"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5327840","5328840"," they're not going to spend money."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5328840","5330840"," When the money's flowing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5330840","5332840"," But."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5332840","5335840"," I play behind it is you see Elon do this stuff."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5335840","5339840"," Yeah, I know that there's some, some of my own friends are like."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5339840","5341840"," You know, you don't want to see."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5341840","5343840"," Escalation of war."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5343840","5345840"," Or even the chance of a world war three."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5345840","5351840"," And you got Elon Musk busting out the star link and not only did he bust out the star link,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5351840","5352840"," but we talked about."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5352840","5354840"," The mesh network of these satellites."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5354840","5356840"," And they were turned off over Ukraine."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5356840","5358840"," You could see a big giant hole."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5358840","5360840"," Not a hole, but it was turned off and it's turned off in India."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5360840","5362840"," Some other places Russia."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5362840","5364840"," Until until they can get through the."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5364840","5367840"," The bureaucracies turn on or even not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5367840","5369840"," Like right now, if you sell, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5369840","5371840"," If you're a sailor, you know, already know this like."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5371840","5373840"," You can't take a."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5373840","5375840"," You can't take certain tracking or GPS devices in certain countries, even ones."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5375840","5376840"," You can't take a."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5376840","5380840"," You can't take certain tracking or GPS devices in certain countries."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5380840","5383840"," Even ones you'd think you'd be OK going into like India."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5383840","5384840"," You can't bring."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5384840","5385840"," You can't bring us."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5385840","5389840"," And where do you even go is illegal all over the world."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5389840","5391840"," Basically one of those things."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5391840","5393840"," They're considered spy devices, depending on where you."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5393840","5394840"," Where you live."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5394840","5395840"," But it was interesting to see that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5395840","5397840"," Elon, you know, took a chance doing that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5397840","5398840"," He took a chance by."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5398840","5401840"," By getting that shit to him to to Ukraine really quick."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5401840","5402840"," It's an aggressive act."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5402840","5404840"," It's an American aggressive act."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5404840","5406840"," It also doesn't look good for star wars."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5406840","5409840"," If you're against Starlink or you're against the U.S."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5409840","5411840"," You bet you should be scared."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5411840","5412840"," Chills that point, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5412840","5414840"," Because you got the fucking networks there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5414840","5416840"," The satellites are there at any moment."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5416840","5422840"," He can turn them on anywhere he wants in the world and get that shit to you anywhere in the world, which is very pro."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5422840","5423840"," It's not."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5423840","5428840"," It's not anti war at all in any way, shape, or form."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5428840","5433840"," So I mean, if I'm like a gun totem to a gun, I'm like a gun totem to a gun."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5434840","5441840"," So I mean, if I'm like a gun totem to a freedom, love and shit kicking truck, driving American, I'd be like, fuck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5441840","5442840"," Yeah, Elon Musk."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5442840","5450840"," And so I think that's a super neat marriage of having like people with different thoughts and viewpoints."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5450840","5453840"," And then you got Elon in the middle of all of it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5453840","5461840"," You know, kind of in the middle of all of it, like a guy you don't want to like for some things on both sides of that coin."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5462840","5465840"," I think it's hilarious."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5466840","5467840"," No, I didn't see it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5467840","5468840"," I didn't see it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5468840","5470840"," I should all watch it though."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5470840","5471840"," The South Park episode."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5471840","5475840"," One of my favorite South Park episodes though was when they were drinking smug."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5475840","5478840"," The cup glasses of smug in San Francisco."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5478840","5482840"," They're like, smell that smug and they're farting in their cups and sniffing it up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5486840","5487840"," Oh, yes, I will."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5487840","5488840"," Yes, I will."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5488840","5489840"," IPOF for accuracy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5489840","5490840"," Roger that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5490840","5491840"," Roger that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5491840","5492840"," Oh, yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5492840","5493840"," Winky face."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5493840","5496840"," And then margin calls begin around three p.m. and commodities."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5496840","5498840"," We should talk about that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5498840","5499840"," You guys all wrote."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5499840","5504840"," You guys want to know on commodities specifically when you have those Ripper high movements."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5504840","5507840"," I'm assuming there's a pencil in here or something like that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5507840","5508840"," Create a screen shot."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5508840","5510840"," I thought I had a pencil."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5510840","5512840"," Can I do a line?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5512840","5513840"," Oh, yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5514840","5516840"," Oh, yeah."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5516840","5520840"," When you guys do like when you guys see moves like this, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5520840","5521840"," Oh, shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5521840","5523840"," I don't know what I'm doing here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5523840","5524840"," I fucked this up already."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5524840","5526840"," They have no fucking clue what I'm doing."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5526840","5528840"," Looks like my line is staying there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5528840","5531840"," Oh, wait a minute."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5531840","5532840"," Oh, shit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5532840","5533840"," What did I do?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5533840","5537840"," I guess I got to delete this line sucks."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5537840","5539840"," All drawings."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5540840","5544840"," I don't know if I want to leave this one back here because I fucked this up."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5544840","5549840"," So when you guys see those Ripper moves up high, if you're going to short them down, like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5549840","5551840"," let's say you're going to short oil down."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5551840","5556840"," You can take the initial short, but get out of it quick because it'll shoot back up again."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5556840","5564840"," You want the best way to short a rip move like a ripper like that in oil or any kind of commodity is you take the second short, not the first one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5564840","5567840"," The first one down is usually brief."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5567840","5570840"," The second one down is deep as fuck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5570840","5571840"," Normally deep as fuck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5571840","5573840"," So you wait for the first one."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5573840","5578840"," There'll be a recovery and then you take the second short and you hold it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5578840","5579840"," I don't know."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5579840","5580840"," Some of you guys probably know that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5580840","5589840"," Some of you guys probably don't."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5589840","5600840"," Yeah, so I just ordered a star link because the new Pro Pro model allows you to change where you're at."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5600840","5601840"," All right, I got to watch that then."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5601840","5606840"," I'll watch that tonight."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5606840","5611840"," I'll have to watch the South Park tonight."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5611840","5612840"," The Maverick of Wall Street."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5612840","5614840"," I like that guy actually."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5614840","5616840"," That guy's pretty awesome."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5616840","5618840"," I'm not a bear, but I like watching him."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5618840","5619840"," I don't want to."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5619840","5622840"," I haven't watched him in a long time, but I have watched his shows."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5622840","5626840"," I don't know who that guy is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5626840","5632840"," I don't know who that guy is, but I watched his show one because it was well produced."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5632840","5637840"," Two, though, that guy's got to have a background in some kind of production of some sort."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5637840","5643840"," I don't think he's an actual trader either because that guy puts the shit together."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5643840","5647840"," Like I was looking at one of his shows and I was like, man."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5647840","5649840"," I was like, not a show, but like his brother."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5649840","5651840"," He puts it on a show every night, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5651840","5654840"," And I was watching one, maybe like three months ago or six months ago."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5654840","5655840"," And I was like, fuck."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5655840","5659840"," I was like, I was like, what this guy needs to put in his shows every night."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5659840","5660840"," Right wrong."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5660840","5662840"," Whatever his viewpoint is, doesn't matter."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5662840","5665840"," But his show is the quality of a TV show."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5665840","5670840"," Like he's like a few steps away from having a show and like CNBC."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5670840","5673840"," If you look at the quality of that production that he puts in,"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5674840","5680840"," the quality of his writing, the quality of the editing, that guy does bang up job."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5680840","5684840"," Probably one of the best produced shows on YouTube."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5684840","5687840"," If there was like a, hey, how good of a show, you got a better, better show out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5687840","5691840"," Like production wise, he's pretty much got the show on YouTube."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5695840","5697840"," He's fucking hilarious too."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5697840","5698840"," He is fucking through."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5698840","5699840"," The guy's got it."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5700840","5701840"," I don't know who."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5701840","5705840"," I'm like, I've, he's, it's the only show out there that I've questioned."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5705840","5707840"," It's the only show out there."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5707840","5711840"," A question that I've been like, man, is this like, does this from a hedge fund?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5711840","5716840"," Like, like, is this a hedge fund out there trying to, trying to swing retail trade out?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5716840","5717840"," I don't know who he is."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5717840","5719840"," I'm not saying that he is that guy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5721840","5724840"," But the production level that goes into that show is insane."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5724840","5725840"," Have you ever watched?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5725840","5728840"," Have you ever seen that guy in Maverick of Wall Street?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5728840","5729840"," Watch him."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5729840","5733840"," He's worth watching even for a contrarian viewpoint."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5733840","5739840"," If you're both specifically, he's a great contrarian voice on YouTube."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5739840","5743840"," I think he's got a presence on Twitter, but I don't follow him there either."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5743840","5745840"," But the guy's fucking awesome."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5745840","5747840"," I'm like, man, this can't be one guy."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5747840","5757840"," If it was one guy, then he's got to be like a, he's got to be a, he's got to be some form"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5757840","5760840"," of a, what's going on here with the, with the spy here."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5760840","5764840"," Kind of just, kind of just decide what it's going to do, huh?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5767840","5769840"," Doesn't know what it wants to do right now."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5774840","5778840"," There's that target above 430."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5779840","5782840"," A couple of levels down here, 426, 12."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5788840","5792840"," Billions just out of YouTube were telling people to buy stocks."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5793840","5794840"," Oh, who's billions?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5794840","5796840"," I don't know, I don't know billions."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5798840","5800840"," Maverick was a truck driver?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5800840","5802840"," Well, I'm calling bullshit on that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5802840","5803840"," Bullshit."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5805840","5806840"," Who's billions?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5818840","5819840"," I don't know if I believe he's a truck driver."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5819840","5820840"," That guy's got skills."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5820840","5826840"," If that guy's a truck driver, he could probably put, he could probably, he could probably"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5826840","5829840"," pitch a show to like a Bloomberg TV or something."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5830840","5831840"," No shit on that."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5831840","5833840"," Like that shit is quality."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5836840","5837840"," Where are we taught?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5837840","5838840"," What's billions?"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","5960840","5964840"," She didn't address the issue."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5964840","5965840"," How it should be addressed."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5965840","5970840"," So, so they asked her trigger questions."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5970840","5971840"," She didn't answer properly."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5976840","5977840"," It's not the right questions."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5977840","5981840"," Another right answers to that quote to those questions."
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5981840","5982840"," Well, in terms of the market to in terms of price and cost and that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","5982840","6010080"," You all the bag holders on energy are coming out of the woodwork, right now, how do you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6010080","6011080"," innovate?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6011080","6013080"," You're coming out of the woodwork right now, huh?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6020200","6022200"," So billions is good, huh?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6023720","6025720"," Yeah, what do you guys think about"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6031440","6033920"," Yeah, I don't follow him on Twitter, but he's um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6034560","6039840"," But he shows great to watch like production wise shows unreal"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6041840","6044040"," Yeah, I gotta change my screen size here too"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6045000","6047000"," NVDA"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6047800","6050680"," And you get I need to get a better us I need to resize"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6051320","6057520"," Recalibrate my screen my screener here needs to recalibrate it too. I've got a new screener. So this screener is wrong"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6058960","6062160"," I've changed the okay in VIA"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6063200","6065200"," Hey, I'm gonna fast that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6065200","6069640"," No fast that um that loaded up. That's super fucking fast"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6072080","6075240"," So let this uh in VIA load up a little bit more"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6076960","6078960"," Take a look at the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6080240","6082240"," Still rising beautiful"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6083200","6085760"," Here are still rising on Nvidia"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6090320","6092320"," Got some resistance here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6093840","6095840"," Real sellers are above at 435"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6101300","6105740"," Just slow right now low volume"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6107360","6109360"," Low volume currently"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6119640","6121640"," Low low volume on Nvidia"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6121640","6123640"," So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6127640","6130720"," So I was a way out numbering this is just a solid bear market rip"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6131400","6134640"," Yes, is a short covering still to some extent"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6135720","6140920"," Probably has to do with the ECB with the euro euro basically europeans this morning"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6140920","6143440"," They were like we're not ready to put the cocaine bowl away"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6145640","6151320"," Euro the euros were like give us the cocaine we have war the threat of war"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6151640","6155720"," I need more cocaine and so when you hear something like that, it makes you wonder"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6157000","6159000"," What the feds gonna say"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6163400","6170920"," It's like that the question is is the Fed going to be as hawkish and you know there were some Europeans this morning they were like get fucked"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6172440","6174280"," You have to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6174280","6181400"," Rain it in and they didn't and so that was I mean that's used as some of the reason why we traded higher today"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6182200","6184200"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6193120","6195120"," Yeah, I can"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6197440","6202360"," I've got a I think I can get short interest on any ticker that you want right now in spot gamma"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6202480","6207680"," So you're realist the ticker that you want to see short interest on let me know and I can usually look it up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6208960","6210960"," I think it's on spot gamma"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6211640","6213640"," Yeah, it is most hundred percent"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6216440","6222920"," So I'm trading here at 427 we retested those lows down below at 425 or so earlier"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6223200","6226400"," Got lots of spy calls coming in lots of apple calls coming in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6229080","6233160"," Mike give me what your guess is in the chat what you think is going to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6235560","6240640"," In the chat what you think is gonna be the end of the day is gonna be my thought and then the day is that we're gonna trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6241960","6246760"," Ultimately squeeze higher into the bell and then a big chart will come on the market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6246760","6248680"," But I could be wrong on that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6248680","6250680"," But I think it we're gonna squeeze higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6251360","6258200"," 430 maybe 431 40 32 would be it would be kind of like hey, maybe possibly"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6262480","6265280"," I'm in no position myself currently at the moment"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6266440","6270160"," There's some people out there that think we're gonna trade down to 420 if you were one of those people"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6270160","6273600"," I have already told you guys out there that that you've got"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6274520","6276520"," Puts for today"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6277720","6284280"," 420 peas they're now four cents if you think that we're trading down here. We're gonna roll this market down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6284880","6287380"," They're dirt cheap. They're four cents"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6288160","6290160"," cost you nothing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6291040","6296760"," You can buy yourself some four cent eight cent puts whatever you buy you can just average into them"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6297000","6300920"," And if you think we're selling off into this bell grab some four cents puts"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6302960","6305800"," Or get some 425s those are only 40 cents"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6308480","6313040"," And that we that what you do is you you'll trade you will trade it down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6315280","6320200"," We'll trade it down. I think we squeeze up into the bell at some point though. That's what I think happens"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6320200","6326320"," A little bit of a roll over in the spy currently, but not too concerned about it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6326320","6328320"," It hasn't really sold off here at this point yet"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6330360","6334320"," We have this same area we've got this VWAP down below here at 426"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6334320","6340160"," But the the by the dippers are hiding down here at 425 or so 425 50"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6342840","6347600"," So I'd be looking for a break of 425 50 to take a short position here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6350200","6352200"," we want to see that break lower and"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6352800","6358680"," If you break lower than 425 50 your actual price target then is probably 420"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6365600","6369600"," Yeah price target of 420 we want to break for 425 50"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6370200","6372800"," Because right now it's just it's too risky for my blood"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6372800","6375320"," I would think that we can snap back at any moment and"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6376000","6379080"," We have snap back at every moment today"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6380240","6385840"," So I have no reason to suspect anything different at this point unless you break some some form of support"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6403520","6405520"," That's weak"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6406520","6411360"," Paul saying he thinks that we dumped a 425 then pinned a 428. That's you know Paul. That's pretty good"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6411360","6414300"," I like that take on what you think we're gonna do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6415520","6417520"," Look at NVIDIA once more"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6417520","6421360"," Yeah, NVIDIA is just kind of hanging out. See how do you see how the sale slow? This is moving"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6422560","6426080"," Super slow, I probably have to change some of this stuff here, too. I've got the I"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6427360","6432600"," Have got some limits on what you can and can't see on buys and sells currently"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6433440","6435440"," You can see is more buys than sells"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6436280","6442160"," 6,000 20 91 10 well 1,000 here only a hundred ninety five forty nine hundred twenty nine hundred twenty nine here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6442160","6445600"," So I'm bullish on on NVIDIA right now believe it or not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6447160","6450080"," I like Paul's take that he just dropped where Paul just dropped that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6459680","6461680"," Yeah, I'm gonna check out billions to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6463440","6465600"," Poopatsky"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6465600","6472840"," Saki I call her patsky cuz that's what they call donuts here. I think they're called patsky's in Detroit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6474480","6476480"," I never had one inside moved here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6486120","6489680"," Oh, so max saying that hey cap and mineral and gas one problem"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6489680","6493280"," We've had this past few years scaring drilling finance from makes you have course"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6493280","6498360"," I mean you guys know what you know, it's boom and bust right you guys know you guys know if you're in oil"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6498360","6500360"," If you're in oil and gas what happens?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6501280","6506960"," You know that that the money flows in right from new drilling and then it just dries up. It's gone"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6510480","6513200"," Just gone mq. I'll do mq next"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6514880","6516880"," mq"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6517760","6520400"," And subscribe I gotta probably have to do some work on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6522920","6527360"," On my settings to because I was fucking around the settings today on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6528600","6530920"," Book maps all I'll look back at that again"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6538240","6542340"," Why would all right so Josh has a great question we'll answer right now for you, too"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6543140","6549260"," So the question becomes why would we squeeze up if we get if we gapped up today?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6550100","6551540"," That's a great question"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6551540","6559300"," You've got a lot of a lot of it is returning to the scene of the crime a lot of it is that when when shorts close"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6559300","6566420"," They want best price to reenter again a lot of it is you're squeezing the last bit of shorts"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6566580","6569420"," Currently so most shorts are closed at this point, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6569420","6575660"," They've been closing their positions all day long since this morning and right now you're doing max pain on shorts"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6575660","6581740"," That's still having closed so what they'll do is they'll squeeze these shorts higher right into the bell, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6582260","6587460"," To a capitulation point when they capitulate they have to buy the market and hope that the market goes up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6587540","6592380"," So you're turning bears the last bears into almost like bull zombies"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6592460","6597300"," They have to run it up a little bit hold long right into the bell"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6597300","6604180"," So it goes up another 30 40 points then they can sell their longs and take it and rejoin a short position"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6604180","6606300"," And then you've got bears out there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6606300","6611900"," They're like we're gonna wait until these last bears are these other bears get squeezed then we're gonna go short great question"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6611900","6622940"," Let's see what else you guys got so I got MQ working for you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6628900","6631780"," Why didn't we retrace the gap up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6632620","6637700"," Been waiting for it. Yeah, you know the so hey hit Mikey good to see brother"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6638820","6640720"," Yeah, Pat ski right it's Polish"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6641900","6645740"," Yeah, this is a fucking these ball of these like sexy little donuts that they have here in Detroit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6645740","6648380"," They like make them special times of the year banging"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6651660","6653660"," The"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6655460","6657460"," The"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6658940","6662740"," No, I don't think it always happens same day if you're talking about a three-day trade right like three green bars"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6662820","6668100"," Something like that. That's another good question. I see a question about about gap filling right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6669100","6674380"," It comes a question that we're gonna fill that gap down there for that gap up fuck no"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6675180","6677740"," And there's reasons why you don't fill that gap too"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6677740","6682260"," So not that we can't but I because I think we're gonna roll the fucking whole entire market over"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6682780","6685340"," But you don't always have to fill a gap in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6686460","6692700"," A place this is something you want all of you to understand if you go to a one-year chart on the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6692700","6695300"," Now, I'm not saying this is why we're not gonna fill the gap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6695300","6700380"," I'm giving you a reason for why we don't fill gaps sometimes why we don't come back and fill some gaps"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6700500","6703040"," If you look on a year chart, we spent"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6703540","6705180"," Okay, ready?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6705180","6708180"," We spent from April 19th, 2021"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6709500","6712700"," Until June 21st, 2021"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6713820","6715820"," Lifting up to this point in the market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6716740","6720380"," Okay, so though you have a gap at this moment here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6720380","6722380"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6722460","6729060"," Still have all this support like longtime support typically where you see gaps get filled"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6730060","6736060"," Is a place that we haven't spent a lot of time at so an example would be?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6737740","6744060"," 479 480 was the high on spy, right? If we traded higher, let's say to 500"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6744500","6747420"," Right, and then we saw and then we sold down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6747500","6752140"," We've that's why sold down we left a gap behind and selling down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6752700","6754700"," And we gapped back up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6754700","6761260"," You would you would more than likely return to fill refill that gap because it's the first time we've been there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6761500","6767540"," So if we've spent like months and months and months and months in a certain time frame in a certain price zone"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6768660","6772820"," And you leave a gap behind there. It's typically not so bad"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6773300","6778100"," That's going up and down if you see gaps in areas that we've spent time in building support"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6779860","6781540"," In the past"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6781540","6784580"," We tend not to always come back and fill those gaps in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6786100","6788100"," Most of the gaps that we fill"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6788660","6791380"," Are in places that we have not spent a lot of time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6792260","6796980"," So just just be just be clear on that and we'll people because people are like oh we have to fill that gap or"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6797460","6800580"," We always fill that gap or then you hear people on the other side that I even say"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6801060","6805300"," No, we don't ever have to fill that gap. There is a some there is some standing behind that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6805300","6810580"," If you've spent a lot of time in that area if that area has become some support"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6811780","6815060"," In the past and especially like it was it was over time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6816340","6822020"," Uh, you don't you don't always come back and fill that gap. So there is a chance that we don't fill that gap to be honest with you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6823220","6825220"," There is a chance that we won't fill it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6825540","6831380"," We might we might actually roll the market over from we over in this 430 area. I see us rolling the market over"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6832340","6834420"," Personally, I think we roll the market over again"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6835540","6841380"," I'm still bearish here overall overall pictures bearish and if we come back to fill that gap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6842100","6844020"," It wouldn't be because"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6844020","6850260"," Of uh, we we missed it here yesterday because we can not fill this gap and we'll be fine not fill in it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6850980","6853380"," We've perfectly fine never fill in this gap ever again"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6854260","6859140"," If we turned bullish, I wouldn't even look at this gap ever again because of where just because of where it's at"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6859780","6861140"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6861140","6866020"," I think we trade lower. I think I think we roll from 430 and we actually hit 400 and lower"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6866100","6868660"," I'm still in the bear camp of we're going down like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6869460","6875220"," You guys don't even want to hear this stuff like I see 370s. I see 200s like 260. I think I was looking at last night"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6876580","6879080"," I see low low low low low low low"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6879560","6881560"," So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6881560","6885320"," You know that gap will mean a fucking thing then will it a fucking gap will be gone"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6892280","6895880"," Yeah, roll the market over so I'll bring it up real quick. Give me a second here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6898520","6901640"," Give me just a second here. I'll bring it up so you guys can see what women"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6901640","6903640"," It"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6904840","6909160"," See if you guys and we're talking about here the question you're new here talking about right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6910600","6913320"," Go about revisit it right now again. Okay"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6919640","6923960"," So how we roll this market over i'm going to show you how you roll this market over right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6925720","6928840"," I'll show you guys. I know some of you guys know it's like ad nauseam for some of you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6929720","6931720"," Let's look at it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6931720","6933480"," right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6933480","6937800"," Then roll in this market over since when way up here, right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6945240","6947400"," Way up here get up there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6950440","6952440"," Right at that top right there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6955720","6957240"," Okay"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6957720","6963800"," This is a trading area right when we trade out of these areas we tend to come back to them over time right if we trade above"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6964840","6970120"," We tend to come back in into where we want to be right. This is a negative channel that we're in. We're trading down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6970840","6972840"," right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6973080","6975080"," We trade out of these bounds"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6975880","6981320"," We tend to trade back into them. We trade above we trade above right we have no no different news"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6982200","6984040"," Saying we're going up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6984040","6986040"," We're at a resistance point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6986200","6991640"," Currently and what does it mean we roll the market over? So well, it's worked so far since"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6993000","6998040"," December 28th january no it's not not here since january 4th"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","6999800","7002120"," So the question comes how do we roll the market over? Well, you'd"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7004280","7006280"," You know you'd start rolling it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7008440","7010440"," Damn it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7010680","7012680"," Just like this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7013640","7018920"," That's how you roll the market over right there. So the question becomes just timing like how do you um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7020520","7027320"," How do you time this market rolling over? Do you take shorts here? How much risk do you put on with this, right? Or do you take it higher?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7028520","7030840"," When you're looking on a block grander scale right here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7031240","7036440"," You know the question becomes when does it roll over? Is it roll over right now into the clothes? Is it roll over in the after hours?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7037320","7039320"," In a little liquidity environment?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7039480","7041960"," Does it roll over when exactly does it roll over?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7043640","7048760"," You see a battle right now between the bulls and the bears if we're going to take this over or not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7050760","7056920"," Right, so this is where the money was right and the question is do we ever fill this gap, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7062040","7064440"," So let's say you didn't see all this over here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7065080","7069160"," Any gaps in here I'd expect to get filled anytime we've spent lots of time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7069800","7072520"," See all this time we spent here April 14th"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7073320","7075320"," all the over to to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7075880","7077880"," June 22nd, right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7077880","7080600"," Then we revisit it again. We said fuck. No, we're not selling it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7080760","7087800"," We visit it down here again. Fuck. No, we're not selling it. We visited again. Fuck. No, we're not selling it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7088360","7092760"," It's a lot of time spent in this zone. Now. That's the bull case"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7093400","7096440"," And that's what i'm saying is so if you're if you're at a new all-time high"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7096520","7098520"," It's easy for these gaps to get filled"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7099320","7101880"," You have to spend time in an area. Okay"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7102760","7106360"," Now on the bear case, they're like we got to fill this gap down here in reality"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7107000","7109640"," I'm not even paying attention to filling a gap. I'm looking for"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7110520","7113960"," I'm looking for a role in this market straight over like i'm looking for"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7116840","7118760"," I'm looking for this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7118760","7120760"," To play out over here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7120920","7124840"," I think it's lower than hit this. This isn't showing futures, which it should or spx"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7125720","7127960"," But i'm looking for that down there looking for this role"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7128840","7130840"," And then i'm looking in all honesty i'm looking for"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7131880","7133880"," Still i'm looking for this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7135240","7137240"," Something like this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7138120","7140120"," Now we get some consolidation"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7141160","7143160"," And a slip"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7143560","7144520"," Right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7144520","7149720"," 404 right so that's your that's your bear case now if you break below here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7151400","7153400"," Right, you know you're setting that up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7153880","7155880"," rejection"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7156440","7160440"," And you'll actually get like 390 something like that. Oh, sorry"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7162920","7164920"," And then you would get something"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7168280","7170280"," You might break higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7170680","7173880"," You get something like this again firm rejection and there's your next step down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7174280","7179240"," Now do we do this for sure? No at every every leg you have to every single one of these legs you have to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7179720","7183320"," Uh trade because that might not happen right who might actually break higher here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7184280","7187160"," You actually break higher here and then come down and up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7187800","7192520"," Right make a nice shot up. So you trade every one of these moves doesn't matter if you're bullish or bearish"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7192520","7194520"," You just trade what's in front of you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7194520","7199000"," Right, we've just completed this down here. We've just completed this down here. This is a second retest"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7199720","7203880"," And so now we're trading higher now to see if we're we were meant to go higher, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7204120","7208360"," We've tested we've tested we've tested I think with this test was in um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7208360","7210360"," Or"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7210440","7213320"," Or that the second test is a higher low which is good for the bulls"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7213800","7219560"," And so the question becomes the market is going to directionally move higher and say well if we're not going down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7219960","7223320"," We're gonna then check above and if we have reason to go higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7223640","7226520"," We'll go higher if we get rejected here and they say no, we're going down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7227080","7232920"," Right they'll move us down now if if we can't get it done in cash market and we are going down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7233480","7236440"," Right what they'll do is they'll make us move a move down in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7236840","7240360"," After our in futures they won't do it in cash oftentimes"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7240760","7245720"," You'll see when they can't make these moves in regular cash market. They'll make those moves in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7247080","7249080"," In futures believe it or not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7250680","7252680"," So have a look see here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7253960","7259000"," We'll see if we squeeze up and higher if they pin it into this close so that futures pushes it up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7259720","7264920"," Maybe there's something we don't know. Maybe that the big banks have i've done all those shorts and they're not going to reapply them"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7265560","7269400"," Um, so that's that's how you get that move higher in futures market as well"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7282920","7284920"," Take a look here. We've got sellers here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7285080","7287560"," So check these numbers out here you get buyers buyers"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7288280","7293400"," Big buyers here. Yeah, kind of decent sellers, but still not huge selling going on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7294200","7296200"," Still not a lot of selling going on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7298120","7300120"," Still not a ton i'm bullish still here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7302520","7304520"," I'm still bullish"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7323400","7325400"," I"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7327080","7333720"," Economists are saying spx 2500. Yeah, I see 2600. I see that I see 2600"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7338040","7339880"," Shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7339880","7344760"," 383 nothing I can show you guys I can show you guys going back to the 1940s"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7345560","7350440"," At every time we've had market crashes. We've we've retraced 50% almost to the tick"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7351080","7353960"," 50 to 52% almost to the tick from the high"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7355000","7358360"," I can show them to you in the 40s. I can show it to you in the 30s. I can show it to you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7358360","7364680"," It's the 30s and 40s like 1937 1937. We have so we had a recovery from the Great Depression"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7365480","7368920"," And it was it's a neat thing too if you want you know the really neat thing is"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7370040","7372040"," if you compare"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7372040","7375720"," um the recession of the 1930s to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7377400","7379400"," uh the market crash of"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7381320","7383400"," the market crash of uh covid"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7385160","7391400"," The timeframes are a little slightly different, but we crashed and then we recovered in the in the mid 30s"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7392520","7394520"," And then we hit a recession"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7394520","7396440"," 1937 I think"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7396440","7403640"," And we retrained we retraced 52% of that move that that move higher the move higher wasn't as big as our move higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7404200","7409240"," in code of recovery because of modern monetary theory, but we also um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7410200","7416280"," Lot we we retraced 52% of the market from third 1937 and 1941 I think"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7416920","7419880"," And then it was interesting we traded higher during world war two"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7421640","7429160"," Uh, but we've had other moments too 1970s. We had some moments like that. We've had some smaller and larger moves as well in the uh 80s"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7430600","7432600"," Like 1986 87 and then again"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7433480","7436760"," You know about the 2000s you guys have heard that shit at nauseam right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7437240","7439640"," 2015-2018 that kind of stuff"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7451640","7453640"," What's going on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7461240","7465800"," Do we have any chance the bottom being in for the air picked up some veil or it on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7466520","7468520"," So again mq real quick"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7470280","7472280"," Uh, we've got"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7473240","7475880"," More sellers and buyers here right you can see that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7479640","7481640"," Squish it up a little bit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7481640","7484520"," More sellers than buyers resistance here at 11 dollars"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7485160","7488280"," I'm gonna assume assume that mq's got a squeeze potential to 1250"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7488680","7490680"," It's the only thing that I could say on this one"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7490680","7493880"," Possibly there must be this must be news driven something that I don't know"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7494760","7498600"," Says down here. We got more buyers and sellers probably over the entire day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7500520","7503560"," But currently we've got more so we've got some solid solid solid weakness"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7504200","7510680"," Price are below is 861 for some support resistance above is 1250 real real sellers though"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7511080","7516360"," Are hiding up above here at 15 dollars if I had to guess there must be some news coming out on mq"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7516760","7519960"," And then it's looking for a squeeze higher. This is this is definitely a squeeze candidate"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7520360","7524200"," How it's set up the buyers and sellers and where your real resistance is"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7525000","7528040"," Uh, and you've got some great great buyers down below and and mq"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7530360","7535000"," Now a good question the am asked is there a real chance that this is the bottom for the market for the year"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7535480","7536760"," Uh, no"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7536760","7539320"," Even if this is a localized bottom for the year"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7539400","7544280"," You would almost guess for sure that we're going to come back down here at some point by summer time and retest one more time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7544600","7546600"," If not two"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7547080","7551720"," There's a whole litany of reasons between destruction down to the market at this point to the recovery of that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7552200","7553240"," To"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7553240","7556520"," Having needing reasons to go up to all time highs once again"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7557000","7560360"," So my point would be the most bullish i would be right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7560920","7565320"," The most bullish you could be right now is we attempt to trade it. So let's say 460 or 480"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7566200","7568200"," We're going to go back down again"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7568200","7570200"," Uh, find a new low"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7570440","7575800"," And we're going to come back up again find a new low sometime in fall and then we'll have a holiday rally into december"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7575880","7577880"," And that's the bull case"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7577880","7582680"," Because the shit that you need to go right for them for the for the bull case is vast and extensive"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7583240","7585240"," You're talking about qt"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7585320","7588200"," Not being stopped talking about no rates talking about no wars"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7588680","7592680"," You're talking about, uh, all the fucking shortages going away talking about"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7593320","7597960"," All the inflation going away talking about greedy car salesman saying nope"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7597960","7601240"," We're not doing this anymore. I'm talking about companies"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7601800","7604360"," Not laying people off. We've got full employment right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7604440","7607880"," Talking about we were want you're gonna want to see layoffs. You're gonna want to see growth"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7607960","7610440"," You're gonna want to see uh free cheap money"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7611080","7612280"," No rates on money"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","7622040","7626280"," Uh coming back into this market currently and when we don't have all those pieces"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7626920","7630200"," Every single time we don't trade like we did the last two years"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7630760","7633960"," The way with the way we trade last few years is an anomaly"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7634920","7637000"," Like it or not. It's an anomaly. That's what it is"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7637560","7639800"," Um, so we'll see more you're gonna be"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7640920","7643640"," You're gonna come back into some kind of a normal trading"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7644360","7646200"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7646200","7651000"," Pattern at some point in this market and it's not going to be like 2020 and 2021"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7651720","7656200"," Unless something happens that we don't know we got like a fourth wave of corona. Maybe"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7656680","7660600"," Um, we get we get a bunch of these pieces some new growth coming into a company"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7660760","7664600"," I saw articles this week. I saw articles this week. I saw um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7667400","7669400"," There's our price target above baby"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7669640","7670600"," So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7670600","7672600"," I saw articles this week. I saw layoffs"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7673320","7678200"," I saw zoom laying people off. I saw another company saying they were gonna focus"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7678520","7683880"," And I mentioned this last week and sure enough this week. I see a news article saying we're gonna focus on our core"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7684360","7687400"," On our core products. I'm like, there we go right. Fuck in there. They're already saying"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7687720","7690520"," You're already seeing here in motherfuckers out there saying"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7690920","7694840"," Well, we're gonna lay some people off and you're already here people say boom. There's a move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7695800","7697240"," boom"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7697240","7699000"," And then and then you're seeing people"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7700440","7702440"," Then you're seeing people saying"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7702680","7707960"," You see people saying things like well, we're gonna focus on our core products. We're not gonna be doing an expansion"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7708200","7710360"," No more new research. No more new"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7710520","7713960"," Products we're gonna focus on what we do really well when you start hearing all that kind of shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7714360","7718440"," It shows that there's gonna be some tightening at some point it shows that there's not free free"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7719080","7722600"," Risk-free money for development out there currently so you need a bunch of shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7723160","7727640"," For this to say hey, this is a bottom and the key for you as a bull right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7727720","7730120"," If you think this is a bottom is you buy this bottom"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7730680","7732680"," Right and you trade it to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7733080","7735560"," Uh, you can't trade it to like i'm gonna hold it for two years"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7735560","7738840"," You're gonna have to be like hey, i'm gonna i'm gonna hold this trade to 480"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7739800","7741800"," And take some profit off the table"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7742280","7744280"," I'm gonna look for another buy-in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7744440","7746440"," All right last two years what you could do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7747240","7751560"," As you could buy and walk away and not fucking care you could sell puts all day long"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7753000","7755000"," They weren't gonna fucking print"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7755000","7762200"," But you now have to actively manage and this is what uh money managers do this is what portfolio managers do in normal markets"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7762200","7767240"," Right they actively manage portfolios now when you're like retail trader out there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7767640","7771800"," Like you joe bob off the street and you're like well, i'm gonna take charge of my portfolio"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7772040","7774440"," It used to be easy to do that in the last couple of years"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7774680","7777560"," It's not going to be that easy any longer"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7778440","7782520"," You have to do your own not do diligence in companies, but actual"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7783240","7785080"," investment"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7785080","7787080"," diligence right learn how to invest"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7787960","7791560"," Uh, so they so actively manage your own portfolio"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7792600","7796280"," So that you know where the actual bottoms are people say you can't time bottoms you can"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7796760","7801960"," If you really truly go you can generally speaking time, uh some sort of a localized bottom"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7802600","7804600"," Not always but enough and you can actually"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7804920","7808680"," Uh protect your account as we trade higher in case it isn't the bottom as well"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7808840","7811400"," But you have to instead of just learning about companies"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7811880","7814440"," I was thinking about this the other day is a lot of investors"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7815080","7818600"," But they've been focused especially new investors. They've been focused the past couple of years"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7819240","7820280"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7820280","7824440"," Not I think they they we tell investors got really involved like five six years ago"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7824520","7826520"," I remember I think we had the the the pot"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7827000","7827960"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7827960","7831400"," The rise of pot stocks and that kind of stuff. I think it was right when robin hood"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7831880","7833160"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7833160","7835160"," Came on came onto being"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7835560","7841560"," It's a lot of retail get involved, but even then it was focused not on market dynamics and not on actual investing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7842200","7843880"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7843880","7849640"," Fundamentals it was all based on company fundamentals like just skimming over the investment part and actively managing your account part"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7849880","7854280"," We what I'd really like to see retail traders do is stop fucking looking at companies now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7854520","7856520"," Look you've done that for two fucking years"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7857560","7865000"," And all I hear is fucking not this is what eric agar says non stop fucking garbage bullshit about you pick the ticker"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7865720","7873000"," And in reality, I'd like to see retail traders shift from that from that uh indoctrination. It's a good indoctrination"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7873640","7879000"," It's a great indoctrination, but to shift then from how to uh actively manage your own portfolios"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7879640","7881640"," how to uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7881640","7883640"," Learn how to manage"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7883640","7888840"," Uh in your investments how to look at markets for where you enter where you exit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7889320","7890280"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7890280","7893800"," More than just hey, fuck it. It's tesla. It's gonna be fucking 30 grand someday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7894360","7897960"," Uh, you have to you have to like I don't know how if i'm explaining this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7898920","7900920"," uh enough but"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7901080","7903640"," Is that's what you had to do uh pre"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7903800","7905800"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7907320","7909320"," Oh no i'm getting old"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7910840","7914840"," It's like pre 2019 pre 2018 something like that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7916360","7921080"," I mean do you use to sit there and you did have these fucking fomc means they have the fucking fed would come out"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7921720","7923720"," And they would they would try to fuck you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7924840","7926280"," On both ends"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7926280","7929080"," But the market was bad. They would fuck you if the market was good"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7929080","7931480"," They would fuck you and they didn't give you any hints of it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7931640","7934600"," And they would have these means quietly in a room and they would need to know some of it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7934840","7936920"," But then they'd throw one big fuck you in there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7937560","7940760"," Uh, they don't do that anymore currently. They said they wouldn't do that right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7940760","7942600"," But they used to intentionally"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7942600","7946120"," So spies moving up now in a resistance straight and higher into that 428"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7946600","7951400"," Right, we're gonna be looking for some kind of rejection here. Oh, so i'm gonna try to get a better number here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7953640","7955160"," Get a tighter number"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7955160","7957160"," So now trading at 429 right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7957640","7964040"," Look for maybe a top at 429.57 and then 430.07"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7965320","7967320"," We are trading higher here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7967880","7969880"," We aren't trading lower"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7970920","7973080"," Looks like looks like big old daddy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7974200","7976200"," Jimmy james got it right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7976600","7979640"," It's like we're trading higher here into the bell or at least we are right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7979640","7983400"," We might sell off at some point here get a little bit of resistance above"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7983880","7988200"," I see a little bump right here. Got the old captain james shelf right here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7988600","7992680"," Got the sellers hiding above here. Just waiting to waiting to pour in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7993160","7995800"," We don't always make it up to this area. I see this area"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","7996520","8001160"," 429 ish don't always make it up to firm resistance"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8001640","8007240"," But you'll see this little stepping stone if we can break through this resistance into the bell here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8007560","8012760"," You might see some ultimate squeeze might not but you might see some kind of a huge squeeze"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8013480","8017000"," Into the bell. So we'll see as that as this unfolds if you are long right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8017000","8020040"," This is probably a place to take some profit off the table"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8020280","8022280"," If you are too aggressive"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8022280","8023640"," You're like hell no cap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8023640","8027400"," I ain't taking shit off the table and you're gonna be looking for this bounce right at 428 26"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8027720","8029720"," If you don't get that bounce off 428"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8030520","8033160"," 74 as I said 70 70 excuse me"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8033160","8035960"," It's 428 74 you don't catch this bounce here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8036200","8039800"," Or if we bounce down below to 427 58 and then make the move higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8039800","8042120"," That's possible as well, but take some money and run"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8044040","8046040"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8051400","8052600"," Take some money and run"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8052600","8056440"," Uh, we've got big tech up 5% say does everybody know why we looked at it earlier, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8056600","8060280"," We talked about why big tech was a big tech was up 5% today, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8061400","8065960"," We already saw the the death cross on nazdak"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8066520","8070040"," Nazdak had capitulated deeper than spy had"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8070520","8072520"," so"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8072520","8077240"," Now the question is the spy that the whole market is on the cusp"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8077960","8078920"," of"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8078920","8082360"," Of a death cross and so we're the question becomes"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8083000","8085960"," So now you've got this recovery of this huge recovery in Nazdak, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8085960","8089560"," That's huge recovery and in IWM question becomes"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8090440","8092280"," They're all kind of matched up right now, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8092280","8093960"," All the ducks are in a row"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8093960","8097240"," Do we sell the entire market out here or not?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8100040","8102040"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8110040","8112040"," No worries"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8112280","8114280"," Yeah, that's why you saw nq"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8114280","8118920"," Trade so so much higher today was because of uh, they had already crossed their their death cross earlier"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8119480","8122840"," And they're very good. They're very sold off deeper, but they are a component of"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8123480","8126920"," The of the spy, right? So they're just a component of the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8127560","8129400"," uh small small part of the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8130760","8135960"," And you know what else has this death cross on it is uh, is the Dow Jones industrial average"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8137960","8139960"," Um, so look at CCJ"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8147880","8149880"," Oh, I like this one a lot"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8150040","8153160"," Oh, yeah, who brought up CCJ who said CCJ in here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8154120","8156840"," Oh, yeah, I on se baby"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8158040","8160040"," I on se look at that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8160760","8164200"," Brr, baby burr gorgeous support on $25"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8165080","8167800"," No, no sellers no resistance"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8169000","8171000"," Should have a nice little ripper to 28"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8171880","8173880"," a little closer"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8174760","8176760"," Look at that move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8176760","8177800"," Boom"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8177800","8182280"," 2681 sellers alike. Oh shit. What's going on more buyers and sellers?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8182760","8187960"," Uh, there's a little bit there's no resistance. It was some it up here at 28. Maybe a price higher at 2761"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8188360","8190680"," 2795 could possibly have a"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8191480","8193960"," Could possibly have a squeeze higher all the way to 30"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8194440","8198920"," Uh, this is risky here. I'm going to give you the your best chance as a squeeze to 2804"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8199400","8200200"," and"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8200200","8201240"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8201240","8206520"," Target even higher at 2988 must be some news driven. I'm not aware of what's going on with CCJ right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8213000","8215000"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8218440","8224280"," Now the weird fucking part about the death cross is that you fucking would the fuck that part with death cross is as you enter one, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8224600","8227720"," You'll see huge volatility swings like two three percent moves"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8228200","8232120"," Right, and then you see like a 15 20 percent downward move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8232680","8234680"," This massive fucking move down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8235320","8239800"," And so even if we trade higher from here on a death cross even if we trade higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8240520","8245080"," Right when we come into one the volatility gets fucking crazy like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8245880","8251560"," Crazy crazy moves. And so now we're at 430 right. So what's the question? Do we trade down?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8253240","8255240"," Hold on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8264760","8266520"," Question becomes"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8266520","8271800"," Question becomes in these where we are that those death crosses and then what's really neat about the death cross too is"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8272280","8273240"," uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8273240","8277080"," When they turn green and not red they're usually freaking huge too"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8277560","8281320"," So if we if if you if you go back into tesla"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8282040","8284440"," Last may they were on a death cross"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8285480","8287320"," I don't know if you know that or not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8287320","8292920"," And tesla last summer was in a death cross and I took the long trade on tesla"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8293320","8295320"," And do you want to know why I took the long trade?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8295640","8301560"," I'll tell you guys if you want because they did a I'll show just my curse. I'll show you they had traded down like this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8302360","8306920"," They traded up like this and they made a three-legged a corrective two corrective moves"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8307400","8310280"," And so they had completed their second part of their correction"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8310680","8315320"," And so the death cross that had shown up. I was like nah they ain't going any deeper now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8316440","8323320"," And sure enough if they had completed their their um their second uh corrective move and that second corrective move is plenty"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8323720","8325720"," Uh the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8325720","8329480"," Uh if you guys want to look at the spy to say hey has the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8330120","8336280"," Finished that second corrective move. Uh you could count it as one two and three down to four ten, right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8336840","8341480"," Uh, so we traded higher and the anticipation was we should trade higher. Maybe we didn't"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8342040","8346440"," We didn't so maybe our correction is not over is the point that uh that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8347560","8352600"," Bears are making because you had one two three didn't happen. We traded higher back on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8353080","8355240"," March 2nd and we failed"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8356280","8359080"," Came back to hook down here to retest which we just did yesterday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8359480","8365880"," And the question becomes if we if we made this this second corrective move in this move in the spy and we've failed"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8366280","8371400"," Maybe we have to go one more leg down. If not more actually not just one. I'm saying one but"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8374280","8379880"," You get the bull seven back in on the spy grabbing that dip down here like hell no cap or a shelf bra we ain't going nowhere"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","8396360","8399160"," We're at 50 75,000 right 40"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8399160","8401880"," If 50 is kind of a wash to an extent over here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8402680","8405560"," Kind of a wash right here. So we'll see what happens"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8406360","8408360"," Can't call it from this point guaranteed"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8410760","8412760"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8416200","8417800"," Cap semi to 430. I don't know"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8418840","8422120"," These numbers aren't showing 430 currently. So we want to see some real big balls"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8423400","8425640"," Let's see some giant green balls right here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8431720","8436600"," Oh, yeah, Paul's saying chances we dump into clothes pulls by two calls and get trapped on a gap down tomorrow"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8436600","8440440"," That's a good one too. I like that one. It's like that. I've called say they're a base uranium company"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8441240","8443880"," The food and bands uranium export will give a good play. Yep"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8444120","8448120"," And honestly the death cross is like one of the worst trading any cares because it's almost always late"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8448520","8453720"," Something that simple works. Well, we would all we would all have and I'll go trade again. So that's a good question sport. Okay"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8455400","8458840"," I agree with that until the death cross gets to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8460360","8466040"," Until it gets that close once the pps start touching like the 50s and the 200s when they start getting really close like that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8466600","8468600"," You you you almost not almost"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8469400","8474440"," They almost always uh fail with where that they actually move make a move down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8475000","8478760"," When they touch and if you look back the past 20 years"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8479640","8482200"," Whenever they touch the 50 and the 20, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8482680","8486120"," They the market usually fails if they don't touch"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8486680","8492280"," And they're kind of far apart from each other the market tends to recover and that's like 90 percent of the time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8492440","8495800"," A little at least a general market. No, I'm not basing this on a stock"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8496360","8499560"," Uh, but the general market has p s s p 500"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8499960","8501400"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8501400","8505880"," When you're looking at the ndx iwm dj dj ia"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8506520","8508520"," uh when you look at the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8509000","8514200"," At the composite index in new york stock exchange but composite any of those if you look on a one day"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","8518280","8521240"," Uh or get close even really close we tend to fail"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8521720","8525720"," We tend they are very consistent. They're not consistent on stocks"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8526200","8528200"," Uh, but on indexes they are"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8528680","8532040"," Uh, they tend to be very good indicators and leading indicators"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8532680","8535000"," As you get closer and closer. So you will know"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8535640","8538520"," Uh soon you'll you're gonna know here soon which way we're moving"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8539080","8541720"," Uh for moving up or if we're gonna we're gonna have a massive sell-off"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8551400","8556840"," No, I love autoflow. I like I'm all I like uh, so so this is how we do it here. So or this is how I do, okay"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","8564600","8566200"," So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8566200","8570120"," We went through the whole entire thing with death cross it would spend like 15 20 minutes on it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8570680","8572680"," at the start of the show so"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8572760","8574760"," the uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8575080","8578760"," So like so this is how I trade or invest so I start my day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8578920","8583560"," Well, I do with all the dd and all the news and the market sentiment and the trader sentiment blah blah blah. That's right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8584040","8586040"," And then put it when I start my day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8586120","8588120"," Traditional candlestick charting"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8588360","8593400"," Uh, that's what I do start right there. Just chart it out. Like what does a bear flag look like?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8593400","8597880"," What does this look like? What is that? What's the uh moving average is doing all that kind of shit?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8598200","8600680"," Layer all that shit on I don't put a lot of weight into it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8600760","8602760"," But I put it there because people trade it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8603160","8604680"," Second thing that I look at"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8604680","8611000"," Is I'm looking at the fucking Elliot wave theories guys out there because we trade that there are fucking algos that trade that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8611000","8614840"," There are fucking edge funds that trade that shit. There's retail that trades that shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8615560","8621000"," All those areas are are important to know do they match up to traditional candlestick charts"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8621320","8627400"," Right so you layer that in then I'm sitting there and I look at that or market uh, that market profile and and uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8629240","8633480"," Volume profile and market profile layer that in there. This is every single day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8635240","8639960"," Literally every morning layer that in there, right? And then when I'm done with all that fucking shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8640760","8646600"," Uh, when I'm done with all that fucking shit, then I go over to spot cam and I get all my gamma I get I get all my volatility"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8648200","8650840"," Mm literally memorize that shit every single day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8652520","8659960"," And then and only then right I start to recharge. I reach our recharge classic support resistance levels"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8660760","8662760"," They recharge what spot cam is saying"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8663800","8668280"," And then we come and we look at the book map and we say okay, so what am I looking for here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8668520","8674680"," So what are we doing right now specifically? So we know we fucking already know coming into today. We got resistance at 430"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8675720","8679480"," We know it's here whether it's showing itself or not. We're watching it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8679720","8683480"," We've taken us all day long. We cut up here earlier at like 1240"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8683480","8689480"," We know that up here what the bear is gonna be stepping in when we've got layers and layers of of reasoning"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8689560","8692600"," So now I'm now I'm looking for hey, we're gonna start selling up here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8692840","8697160"," Hey, we're gonna start seeing the sell orders committed mass. I'm gonna start seeing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8697640","8701480"," Then I'm on top of all that shit. We've got uh flow algo here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8702520","8705800"," Or your own float your own flow software and we're like, okay"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8705800","8707080"," We're looking at order flow"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8707080","8713720"," Now we're looking for some kind of waterfall or buildup of calls or puts you start adding all that shit in there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8714040","8716280"," I think how to get a fair fucking idea of"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8716920","8719720"," Which way this market's going maybe he wouldn't then you're watching the news"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8720520","8723720"," Watching twitter you're watching fucking trade the news"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8724600","8730120"," The squawk box or you're watching waltz or bloomberg and you see you know, waltz bloomberg drops an article like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8730680","8735400"," Uh, we're all fucked and then you're like shit, right or"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8737320","8740760"," Or are you watching article from waltz bloomer when it's like, hey, it's fucking party time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8741320","8744360"," Fucking but I don't know some fucking fed bear came out and said the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8744840","8748600"," The fucking economy is great. Then you're like, hey, well, we know we're at some huge resistance"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8748840","8755080"," We know they're dropping positive news probably going higher or hey, they're dropping some seriously fucking fucked up news right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8755080","8757080"," We're probably gonna go down from here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8758440","8760440"," Does that make sense"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8760440","8762440"," Yeah"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8767480","8769480"," Josh lol death cross and fmc"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8775240","8779960"," Yeah, we went through the whole death cross shit earlier today like do they work do they not work when they don't work"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8780520","8786440"," I think they suck as indicators on stocks fucking horrible fucking horrid"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8786840","8788840"," I"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8788840","8792840"," Usually take longs on death crosses and I usually take shorts on golden crosses"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8797480","8801000"," So we'll see what happens here. We're we're trading up. We traded up bounce off 429.08"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8802120","8804040"," Uh, you can see we've got some weight that weakness"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8804040","8810360"," But we've got resistance right here if you wanted to take a take a short here or start to get bearish at this point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8810840","8812840"," Uh, you want a recommendation"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8813160","8816760"," Uh, so 429 right you can open something up for you here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8818920","8820920"," And we'll take a look at"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8821560","8827080"," How to how to get into being short here and not get overly aggressive with it in case we go higher"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8828520","8832840"," Right, but you're like, hey, Kevin want to protect the long here. I want to take a long here cap, but"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8833480","8834440"," Um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8834440","8838280"," I'm never I'm never at these supports and resistance is I never know what the fuck you're doing cap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8838760","8840760"," I never understand where you're coming from"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8840760","8844200"," Never never figure out what's going on with with this shit. Okay, so"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8845080","8847080"," I'm gonna look at well on here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8850760","8854840"," Now i'm gonna look here. I'm looking at a bigger chart one month chart, right boom boom"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8855080","8859480"," Let's see if we go higher bam. I'm gonna expect some resistance up here around 435"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8860200","8863000"," Maybe even let's just say we travel all the way up to 440"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8864280","8866280"," Make sure I don't have 440"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8868360","8871160"," Yeah, so i'm gonna take some 318's ready"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8871960","8875320"," I'm gonna take some 318's maybe throw an extra week on them. So I got a month out"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","8893560","8898920"," Gonna go with march 25th. I'm gonna go with uh debit put spread. I make it simple to whatever you're gonna do that debit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8899160","8901160"," Credit spreads. We're not gonna talk about"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8901560","8903560"," individual tickers. Hey buddy"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","8914840","8915800"," All right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8915800","8917960"," and so right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8917960","8919640"," if I was to buy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8919640","8921320"," March 25th"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8921320","8924360"," Right, i'm not even legging to this shit. Yeah, i'm not gonna get a super aggressive bearish"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8924360","8925960"," Just not even legging into it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8925960","8927960"," 429 428 p"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8928680","8936200"," Uh spy put spreads just basic not even put back spreads not ratio spreads just 429 428 easy to execute"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8936680","8941240"," They cost 42 and they their max payout is 58"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8942360","8945080"," The probability of them paying is 49"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8945960","8950840"," So has a high rate of probability of paying because even if we traded 440 the full good fucking chance"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8950840","8956040"," We're gonna trade back down and retest 430 or 428. Let me go even higher because maybe we're like, oh, yeah"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8956040","8958040"," That they're probably not breaking 430"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8958920","8964680"," Maybe we'll retest cap but not that bad. Okay, so i'm gonna get you a better a better play kick-ass play"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8966200","8971640"," Right because they can actually look at the like it actually formulate these numbers really really fucking fast in this program. So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8971800","8973240"," So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8973240","8975240"," March 25th"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8975240","8976280"," 434"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8976280","8978280"," 433 p"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8978520","8980520"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8980600","8981800"," Fucking uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8981800","8983800"," Put spread right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8984040","8985800"," All you need to do is hit 434"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8985800","8987640"," 433 at some point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8987640","8990280"," Or be or be or be be added or below it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8990760","8996840"," By march 25th or a retest 430 if you retest 430 you're gonna print two without even getting into expiration"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","8996920","9001160"," You're gonna print a percent you're gonna print like 30 50 percent something like that so nice beautiful spread, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9002600","9010200"," That one has a 56 percent chance of probability of happening and it costs 49 dollars for a profit of 51 dollars"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9011800","9016920"," Here's an even safer one. We'll go even safer with a decent payout"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9019080","9023880"," If I if you take a if you take a 438 437 p expiring on march 25th"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9025160","9031000"," Right 438 437 p it it costs you $58 and pays $42"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9031640","9035240"," I know half you motherfuckers out there not half of you, but I know like a bunch of your assholes"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9035880","9037000"," rarely"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9037000","9038680"," print"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9038680","9040680"," Uh 80 percent on a trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9041560","9043800"," So that's 438 437"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9044600","9046920"," Prints almost 80 percent right 90 percent"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9048440","9053640"," 63 probability chance of that one printing at some point might not print the entire time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9054040","9058200"," But if we go up to hit 440 and start trading lower that shit's gonna print at some point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9058200","9060200"," Right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9060200","9062200"," Right, so there's another one for you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9064760","9071160"," You could shit you could just hit a 440 down to 437 440 down to 430 and it would probably print at some point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9071880","9074680"," Between now and end of march more than likely"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9076440","9078440"," More than likely you're not getting over 440"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9078680","9082680"," Uh by end of march or you are but you're probably gonna swing high and swing low at some point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9083240","9088920"," I doubt that you see like us hit 440 and then go straight to 460 like a straight fucking shot"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9089000","9091000"," I think you come back down and retest"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9091160","9093160"," Uh lower levels at some point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9094440","9096440"," Now let's say we don't"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9096440","9101240"," Let's say you're like cap. I fucking diamond hinted that shit all in the march 25th and it never fucking printed"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9101400","9103400"," They're 25 to 50 percent"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9103400","9107640"," I got fucked cap. Well, that's because you didn't trade both sides"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9108040","9112120"," So you're not a bull or a bear you're a fucking trader and you're a fucking investor"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9112360","9115800"," You're gonna be a fucking investor in a fucking trader either doesn't matter"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9116440","9117560"," What do you do?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9117560","9121160"," You put this put spread on and you're gonna trade this market long"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9121640","9125960"," Until with long aggressively until it rolls over if it rolls over"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9126360","9130200"," Right, you're already know that your put spreads are gonna print the losses that you had in your calls"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9130520","9134680"," You made the wrong call then you leg in to some aggressive downside"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9135320","9139800"," Puts right weekly some dailies short the market whatever you want to do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9142760","9144760"," Does that make sense"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9153240","9158600"," You guys understand because don't fucking matter with the spread that fucking shit can go to fucking 800"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9159080","9162120"," And it's coming back. It's always fucking coming back"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9162520","9166440"," And the best part about a spread is it doesn't completely fucking destroy your positions"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9166840","9168440"," Any kind of spread. I don't give a fuck"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9168440","9171480"," You got to learn the rules for which spreads take why you take them and why you don't"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9171960","9172680"," But"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9172680","9178280"," In different times of the market, but you guys want to know how to not blow up your fucking accounts fucking spreads bra"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9178840","9181800"," Selling them buying them cutting the legs off them depending on where we go"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9182280","9183960"," That's a whole bunch of more complicated shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9183960","9186440"," But if you're a new trader or if you're an investor and you've never"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9187080","9189720"," Traded both sides of the take them taking both sides of the trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9190200","9191320"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9191320","9192600"," Instead of you know"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9192600","9195560"," I love buying the underlying I love buying the spy and selling puts and calls"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9196120","9199080"," On the spy but for me in this market right now. I can't do that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9199640","9201800"," Uh for my own my own convictions"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9202200","9207480"," But if you are trading this market or even just buying stock you should have to be trading both sides always"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9208040","9209960"," Uh always be trading both sides"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9210760","9215400"," Uh, not always there are more risky times and more and less risky times to be trading it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9215480","9218680"," But like right now we're at resistance. So if we're at resistance"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9220360","9221400"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9221400","9227080"," Like so this morning or in the closed yesterday. I didn't have any any had closed out all my"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9227480","9229480"," uh put positions the prior day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9230760","9232760"," Not the prior day on a"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9232840","9235640"," Yesterday I had closed my my uh short positions"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9236200","9240520"," And I'd start taking longs into the closed yesterday. I fucked up my timing on it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9241000","9245880"," Uh, but I knew once I was into the close that there's no reason for me to take more shorts on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9245880","9250040"," I was like I have to take after now leg into longs and dollar cost averaging"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9251560","9252600"," But where we are right here?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9252600","9255320"," Yeah, it's probably pretty fucking safe bet that we're gonna come back and test"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9256120","9261000"," Then you can buy them in the money. They don't need to be fucking spreads are dope. Like you just put them in the money"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9261560","9263560"," Shit, you could just do a ratio spread"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9263800","9265800"," uh ratio spreads are"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9265800","9270760"," Uh like two outside. I think it's two outside the money cup uh two outside the money puts and then one inside the money"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9271160","9274200"," Uh put that you're buying or something like that. No, you're not buying or selling"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9275000","9281720"," You're selling out. No, you're selling you're selling it in the money put and you're I think buying two outside the money puts"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9282280","9283560"," You get that right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9283560","9285960"," Then you cut one side you cut one side off to keep going up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9287400","9294680"," The selling the put I know that's that you keep them all in the the the put the put that you sold ends up printing what you paid for"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9295320","9297320"," the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9297320","9300600"," Uh for the puts that you bought the shitty outside the money puts"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","9343160","9346120"," Yeah, it's cell one and buy two it's cell one in the money"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9346680","9349800"," So you you sell one in the money and then you buy two outside the money"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","9384520","9387960"," There's like basic rules that you can follow and pretty much get away with trading spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9388520","9393480"," But there's so many fucking pitfalls little ones that you don't know about that it's like you have to go out there and watch somebody else"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9393480","9396280"," It's gonna spend like six hours teaching you that shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9396760","9401240"," Options industry council does a really good job of in-depth and explanations"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9401960","9405000"," Because there are mechanics that you have to know this timing that you have to know"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9410120","9413720"," When to open them when to close them when to sell them when to buy them when it comes shut off"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9413720","9418600"," Dividends, uh, shit that doesn't close the cash"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","9426200","9431160"," Youtubers have gotten into trouble with followers because they're like hey, you didn't tell me this could happen"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9432360","9436040"," It's the only reason I haven't released any of those videos is because i'm I don't want someone coming back"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9436040","9437640"," I mean like well, you didn't tell me this could happen"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9438120","9440680"," Like I wanted every fucking last disclaimer cap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9441080","9444680"," And you should have been the one to tell me because there are people that have done those videos"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9445160","9446920"," and they've gotten burned"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9446920","9452280"," On some real cane shit like there's arcane shit out there like you got something you guys might even know some of this stuff so"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9453320","9455320"," the fucking the fucking the"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","9464840","9468760"," They'll fucking pull hanky pankies between four and six p.m"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9469640","9473720"," They don't have to technically the markets closed at four fifteen on the special spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9473800","9476520"," But they don't fucking close they don't close options"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9477240","9478200"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9478200","9479640"," At four o'clock"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9479640","9484600"," They have like these weird fucking closing hours. I think it's like six o'clock or something like that they can push trades through"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9485800","9487800"," in the market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9487800","9488680"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9488680","9490360"," Like there's like there's like there's like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9490440","9496360"," Expirations that are not when you think that they are you think all four o'clock. I'm fucking all set we're weighing the money"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9497320","9502680"," That shit printed and uh, I don't have to worry about them having executed a four o'clock in reality"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9503080","9507960"," They've got fucking orders coming through until like six p.m. They haven't accounted for"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9509000","9512520"," And it actually they actually makes a real price in the stock price"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9512920","9517640"," And they'll come back and fuck you over the weekend by monday morning your fucking account is blowing the fuck up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9518600","9521640"," So I I mean, I'm gonna post that shit, but I'm"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9522360","9525720"," I have to do this like big disclaimer. I'm like, hey, look this is not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9526600","9530920"," The rules these are just the rules that I use so that I don't get fucked"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9533080","9537880"," But you should you should be incorporating especially the place like where we are right now if this where we are right now in this market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9538440","9543320"," Right where we are right now is a time to start taking some risk off"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9544280","9545800"," Take some profit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9545800","9550040"," Uh, you can still take longs, but to also start to hedge a long here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9550760","9552440"," If you're a bear"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9552440","9555800"," What you're doing is what you're going to start to take some"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9556440","9561720"," Less risky bearish positions and put more risk on if the market starts to roll over"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9562040","9565640"," If you're bearish here and you're like, okay, we start we're starting to roll it over"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9567080","9570840"," We start we're supposed or we don't roll it over. I take you check this spread"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9571240","9575000"," Right let this put spread and we start actually going up you can be like, oh fuck"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9575000","9579080"," Thank god. I only took that put spread. Hopefully it prints some date on the road in the meanwhile"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9579400","9583080"," We're gapping up overnight. We're trading higher and we got all those crazy good news coming out"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9583080","9588920"," I'm gonna get long in the market right and start making some money getting long in hope that we revisit that that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9589320","9591320"," previous mark that 430"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9591640","9598040"," Zone in the next kind of coming month. I'm gonna leave those puts spreads open right as a market hedge as I take long now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9598760","9601240"," That same thing reverse works in the inverse too"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9602760","9604760"," So as we were trading into the clothes yesterday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9605240","9608600"," If you were a bear you either closed for profit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9609160","9613160"," Right this is the same thing because you closed it profit at the belly yesterday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9613720","9617560"," And if you didn't close the profit on the bell, what would your what your course of action?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9618360","9620360"," You would have put on some call spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9621240","9624760"," You would have been like well if we gapped down today, we're probably coming back to the scene of the crime"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9624840","9626920"," If we get down the overnight, we'll probably come back to the scene of crime"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9627080","9629240"," You'd probably buy some call spreads in the money in the print"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9629720","9634920"," Not today maybe in two three days and if we fucking if we reverse in the overnight and get fucked"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9635560","9639160"," Right my that my short position is fucked or my long put position is fucked. So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9640200","9644600"," At at certain market zones in the market both bears and bulls you should be"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9645320","9648200"," Putting risk on and taking risk off and hedging appropriately"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9648920","9652600"," At those times and last yesterday at the close was perfect example of a bear"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9653320","9655320"," Bear should should either be closing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9656040","9659000"," As a matter of fact, I closed early yesterday. I ended up closing in the morning"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9659320","9664760"," It was like 10 o'clock or something. I should have fucking it should have fucking I should have held that shell day long"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9665400","9669560"," But I'd already been in them for a few days. So for me, I I took what I wanted"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9670360","9674920"," I was looking for the for the turn and I thought the turn was earlier than it was"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9675960","9677960"," So I had to double down triple down whatever"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9679080","9681480"," So when we get into these areas here you have to be able to manage your positions"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9681480","9686120"," You have to be able to um, had risk and if you're a bull right now start fucking hedging"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9686600","9688760"," If you're a bear right now start laying it on a little bit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9688920","9692600"," You know a little taste of fucking a little taste to turn in this market down to like 400"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9693240","9695960"," You know what i'm saying if you're a fucking bear out there you're getting all itchy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9696440","9698440"," You better get no sweaty"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9698840","9703400"," All your big chest here starting to grow out fucking go around tell the wife like I gotta lock me in the basement"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9703480","9704920"," You gotta chain me to the wall"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9704920","9707880"," Turn off the internet. I'm gonna place my puts. I'm gonna go hide my bunker"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9708680","9712040"," I've got my I've got my two-way radio to the kitchen"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9712360","9716120"," I just want you to call me in a week and get me out of the cage. Okay"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9716680","9722360"," I'm gonna place my bets and I'm gonna fucking lock myself down in the dungeon. That's what bears are doing right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9723480","9725160"," That's what bears are doing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9725160","9728280"," Bears like I don't place my bets. I'm gonna go lock myself in the bunker"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9728360","9730760"," And I know that even if we go to fucking 440 we're coming back"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9738840","9741640"," And then you get fucking bulls out there right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9741640","9746120"," And they didn't fucking take any of this trade and they're like, you know, we're going up right and I'm like fuck you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9746120","9750440"," We're going up. What am I the fucking move was yesterday and it was off the fucking bell today"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9750760","9753400"," Fucking that move is done. Took the money and ran"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9755480","9760600"," You go fucking FOMO yourself. I'll meet you over on four fucking 30 after over 430"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9760600","9762600"," I'll take it up with you the next rut in the next lap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9767880","9769880"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9789720","9795720"," That's the cost of the trade winky it's the cost of the trade man one side costs more than the other"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9798440","9800440"," It"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9803880","9806520"," It's the cost of the it's the same it's the same concept"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9807240","9809480"," It's the same concept as the putback spread"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9810040","9814760"," So when you're buying when you're buying the two outside the money puts they're so fucking dirt cheap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9816040","9819000"," They're so fucking dirt cheap. You're making the difference"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9822040","9824040"," How do I explain that better for you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9824920","9829960"," So like if the so you're so if you're selling a put they're they're expensive"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9830520","9833640"," But you're buying the two puts and they're dirt cheap"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9834520","9839640"," Um, so one if it winds up flipping over and paying you more on the on the opposite end"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9847320","9850280"," Man bear pig, baby man bear pig"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9850920","9858600"," Yeah, I got it sitting right in front of me. I've got the uh, you guys should whether"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","9877400","9879960"," I get the best fills and I can wait to get the fill that I want"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9879960","9885480"," That's a whole nother fucking topic like you can build a spread on some platforms like as you go"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9886120","9892360"," You can like literally set I want to pay this part of the leg of the spread with whether you're buying or selling"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9892680","9894680"," There's some dope shit you can do on tasty"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9895800","9899160"," You can like get all wrapped up in spreads and like even pay better prices"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9899960","9905640"," Um, so you you're picking out different legs of your spreads and then selling different legs of your spreads managing your trade over time"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","9923640","9928520"," All right. The only reason I use it is because i'm looking for condors and butterflies"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9929000","9933560"," I'm looking to time sometimes you'll hear people say the best time to buy a condor or butterfly or sell one"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9933880","9936120"," Is that the first of first 15 minutes of the bell"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9936600","9941080"," Uh, or at the at the end of the day at the beginning of the day because spreads tend to trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9941240","9943000"," There's a lot of action at the beginning of the day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9943080","9949960"," That's where most of the trading occurs when you hear that statement people say oh most trading curves are open and closed because of spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9951240","9953880"," Yep, all is all is trans all these transactions spreads going on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9954280","9958520"," So what i'll do is i'll open this up and i'll look at i'll open up options.ai"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9958920","9961000"," And i'll be like i'm bearish from bullish or i'm neutral"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9961320","9968840"," I'll i'll bring up a trade and i'll start manipulating that trade like 438 to 430 for 50 to 440 for this for that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9969320","9973240"," Uh, and then of course where we are in the market currently is impacts that trade as well"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9973720","9975080"," Um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9975080","9980040"," But i'm looking for the best price in that trade and so just a quick and dirty like i'm not executing him here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9980200","9983240"," But i'm like, okay, so what what does what does this get me right now?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9983880","9987560"," And i'll watch it throughout the course of the day. There's not a lot of demand"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9988360","9991000"," Usually in the middle of the day, but there's huge demand"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9991960","9993960"," At the ending in the starts of the day"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9994360","9996360"," so opening close spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","9996600","9999480"," That's actually days of the week are important as well"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10000520","10004520"," With spreads this is a long conversation. This is some shit we can talk about another time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10004520","10009880"," But whole another fucking thing is people are trying to open spreads on mondays and i don't know if you know that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10010600","10015240"," But people open spreads like a motherfucker on monday on mondays"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10015640","10021160"," So let's say i want to open a spread right i want to open a spread when everyone's trying to get rid of them"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10021480","10023480"," So if friday is coming up, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10024520","10026760"," And i'm like, oh we'll get a friday coming up, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10026760","10029640"," Everybody's trying to get rid of rid of their shit on a friday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10030040","10035240"," That i'm trying to buy that shit for dirt cheap for expiration farther out, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10035560","10037720"," Let's say i'll buy a month out spread"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10038360","10044360"," On a on a friday, right a month out spread on a friday and i'll have the expiration or not that not the expiration"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10044360","10047960"," The expiration one month away, right? And then i'll just hold it over the weekend"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10049240","10054200"," Right or hold it until the next two or three mondays when someone else wants to buy that shit on a monday"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10054600","10059960"," Because i'm buying it when nobody wants it has nothing to do with the price of the spy just has to do with demand"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10060520","10063320"," Right and no demand for certain things, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10063320","10067800"," So timing some always looking at these things to see when there's demand for something when there isn't demand"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10067960","10072200"," Because you want to be selling your shit when there's high demand for it and you want room for it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10072760","10075080"," to have demand if this is more complicated because"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10077000","10079160"," because like the the price like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10079960","10086200"," Traders like whole numbers and you reduce spreads like i said i pulled out 437 438 but in all honesty like a 444"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10086200","10092200"," 438 we bawler because they tend traitors tend to like like 445 440"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10092600","10094600"," 435 430"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10094840","10096840"," So one leg of your spread should be in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10097400","10099880"," a commonly one commonly traded"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10100680","10101880"," Whole number"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10101880","10103880"," It says oh so much shit. I don't tell you guys"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10105000","10107240"," So anyways another another thing too would be um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10108280","10112520"," At like after big moves in the market and you know there's going to be consolidation"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10112600","10117800"," Especially up moves like you know you're like oh we got two three with the markets bullish markets gone up for three days"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10118360","10122520"," We're gonna or markets only gone up for two days. You know where i know we're consolidating here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10122520","10127640"," I know we got no news coming out. We got all this shit. I can guarantee we're gonna go sideways for three or four fucking days"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10128040","10133320"," You go in there and you grab yourself a fucking condor or a fucking or a um or a um butterfly"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10133960","10138760"," And you can get them fucking dirt dirt dirt dirt cheap and they just burn mother's blood"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10139560","10140360"," like"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10140360","10142040"," Print money"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10142040","10145960"," And then you dump them after two or three days before the next leg of the next move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10147640","10149640"," So timing is key"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10157640","10159640"," So"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10180040","10181960"," Oh, I guess those put spreads are printing huh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10183000","10185000"," Looks like those put spreads are printing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10185720","10187960"," Shocker already fucking printing"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10188760","10193480"," Those put spreads I told you about are now up to $62 they now cost $62"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10194440","10197960"," So I guess those put those what those dollar white put spreads actually do print"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10198840","10201400"," They're up to 62 they cost $62 right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10204440","10209000"," Those all things being equal trade winky try to buy one right now. They're $62"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10209000","10219000"," They now cost $62 not out of $60 because they are directional"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10221640","10223640"," So no they do print"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10224200","10226200"," Don't trade don't buy those"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10226840","10230200"," Options they I just get it just bought just get the fucking broker and sign up for it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10230200","10232520"," Don't put any money in it execute the trade somewhere else"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10232520","10237480"," But if you're looking for a quick and dirty hey, what are my chances of this print they even show you implied moves"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10237880","10241400"," Which is another neat little thing on this on this a brokerage is options. I"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10241960","10243960"," But don't fucking trade them there"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10244200","10246200"," But uh, one of the cool parts is"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10246760","10249960"," They give the implied move for both of all your favorite tickers"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10250360","10253560"," So if you're not get if you don't have spot cam and you're like, what's the fucking implied move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10253720","10255640"," They give it to you by the day the week the month"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10256280","10260040"," You can look at what the implication is for where the market thinks we're going"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10261240","10263240"," Which is kind of fucking neat"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10263800","10265400"," Just quick and dirty"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10265400","10267400"," So like here"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10268440","10270440"," I look up the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10271640","10274680"," It's like the mark the implied move for one in the next month"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10276680","10278680"," The implied move from now into"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10279320","10282280"," March 18th in the spy is a low of 413"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10283480","10285480"," And a high of 441"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10285800","10289800"," And so you're like, oh, that's the implied move. I already know that we could get out of 405"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10289880","10292520"," So there must be no interest in 405 p's right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10293320","10296520"," But there isn't but the market makers haven't priced those in yet"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10296600","10298520"," So you're like, what have they priced in these options?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10298520","10302360"," As a matter of fact if we were to trade down to four four thirteen right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10302440","10303720"," You wouldn't see"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10303720","10307960"," 405s gain much value until we hit like 413 then they would kick right in"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10308360","10310600"," So you're like, oh, what what should I be buying for puts right now?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10310600","10312200"," Probably four tens"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10312200","10315880"," If you're gonna buy puts like four tens because they're probably starting to be priced in right now"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10316760","10321720"," Like four tens are just on the cusp of being priced or not but they're not priced in yet"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10322680","10324920"," Uh, but like a 410 p from March 18th"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10325560","10328520"," It will have a premium kick on it over here about that premium kick"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10328920","10331240"," It's like when does it for the premium kick in on an option?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10331480","10334440"," You're like, oh, I bought uh, I bought uh, bought some calls that were"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10334840","10336840"," Or way outside the money they were"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10337400","10342840"," 20 fucking or 200 points outside the money and they really didn't start gaining value until we got within 100 points"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10343320","10349960"," That's because of the implied move the implied volatility and then of course the interest in those options don't kick in until a certain point"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10350600","10356680"," Um, so the the IV moves or the implied moves here on options that AI is a really good way to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10357320","10360200"," Um quick and dirty look to see what to be buying as well"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10379960","10381960"," You"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10389400","10393560"," Now I just watched him go I just watched him go to $62 market just flipped just now"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","10429720","10433720"," It's how I can make bad fucking trades and still get away with it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10433720","10435720"," I"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","10727160","10732200"," Especially on tickers that don't close the cash like credit spreads are can be dangerous"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10733080","10735080"," Credit spreads are fucking dangerous"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10735480","10741960"," I trade them, but I I want to I almost always want to make sure so the way I use credit spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10742360","10745160"," Is typically if I know we're going somewhere"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10745720","10749560"," I'm like, I know we're going up here and up, but I don't want to be too risky with it"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10749640","10752680"," It's credit spread if I don't want to deal to jag it up and down all day long"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10753080","10758600"," If you know we're gonna grind higher, but the price of calls are going to change that much credit spreads your friend"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10758760","10761400"," If you know the direction credit spreads your friend"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10762520","10765880"," All right, but if you're like, hey, I want to put some protection on debit spreads, baby"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10766680","10771480"," Remember that. Okay. That's key. Remember that if you don't trade credit spreads and debit spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10771960","10776600"," Um know that you you have to have a pretty firm idea of direction and that's the other thing too is"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10777880","10780360"," Well, the reason why people like spreads or banks like spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10780680","10784600"," I'll go over this in a video sometime, but you don't always need to know the exact price"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10784840","10790280"," You just need to know the direction that it's going to take or eventually will take so if you're like, hey"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10790440","10792440"," We always go up. We always go down"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10792440","10798440"," Uh, you can it it it dumps down a lot of trading uh by by trading spreads selling and buying"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10798920","10800920"," But I sell spreads all fucking time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10800920","10805880"," Absolutely. The only I don't do anymore is I don't do any ratio. I don't do any wheels shit anymore. I don't do any"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10807160","10812760"," I don't do a lot of theta right now or a lot of theta gang stuff like uh neutral stuff. I don't do a lot of because"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10813240","10815320"," Um there you have to highly manage them"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10816280","10821160"," A lot of theta gang has been getting fucked up a lot of the wheel strategy guys gotten fucked up in this market"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10821720","10823080"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10823080","10827400"," So it's just not the market for me to be doing it on and there's certain tickers for certain strategies"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10827800","10830200"," Like you could you go down the hole of finvis"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10831400","10833400"," And you find tickers that don't ever move"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10834760","10837960"," Except for once in a great while you can throw fucking condors"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10838840","10841320"," On those bad boys. You can throw flies on those bad boys"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10841960","10846040"," People are like i'm doing flies on spy. I'm like, why why the fuck would you do that?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10846440","10849160"," I mean not the claw. I don't use chlorox, but it's not a good one"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10849240","10855160"," But there are some tickers out there that never fucking move they fucking trade sideways for like six straight fucking months"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10856040","10859640"," Fucking you just put a fucking condor or a fucking or a fucking"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10860840","10866120"," Put a condor and now ticker that it moves sideways for like three months at a time fucking printing machine"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10867160","10869160"," No sweat"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10870200","10873400"," No sweat and if you're rich just buy the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10874280","10876600"," Buy the spy and then you sell calls and puts"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10877640","10882040"," Uh, but right now. I don't like that. I don't like the spy right now. I'm afraid of the spy"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10885800","10887800"," Uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10887800","10892120"," So, okay, let's talk about that. Anything on youtube you'd recommend to learn about options. Good question"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10892280","10897480"," So i'll send you down to rabbit hole. You're gonna look up. You're gonna google search the options industry council"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10898600","10900040"," step one"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10900040","10904200"," Search the options industry council. This is a non-profit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10904840","10908120"," That the chicago uh chicago a mercantile exchange"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10909960","10913640"," Has set up for you to learn not youtubers"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10914200","10920360"," Fucking the literal like stock market professionals. No, no everyone. No knows about this. Okay, some people do but"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10920920","10923160"," I usually I used to push it a lot on twitter"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10923640","10926040"," Uh because this is a non-profit that did"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10927160","10931880"," They have the actual it this is the kind of shit that you like you turn you go to your workshop"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","10939960","10944760"," You download these videos in mp3 format for when you're taking a walk so you're driving somewhere"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10945240","10951080"," Um, you put them on on a laptop when you're doing some work, uh, you know in your kitchen cooking dinner or something like that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10951160","10955240"," Whatever it is you do and you just play them in the background. It's like watching c-span"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10956040","10958040"," And they got like fucking"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10958040","10962680"," 30 hours of that shit and you just play them over and over and over again now if you don't understand them"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10962680","10968760"," I'm going to tell you the more the more you listen to them the more familiar you become with the concepts the ideas and the words"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10969480","10974360"," The second thing that you're going to do is you go on to youtube and you start to look up how people trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10975560","10976920"," spreads, right"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10976920","10983560"," Um, you there's a there's a couple there's a guy from tasty works with the glasses. He does a good job of explaining them now with all that said"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10985560","10988920"," You see you'll I forget his name, but he explains how to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10989320","10995160"," Trade him but they're complex still someone that's never traded him and doesn't fully understand you like what the fuck does this mean?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10995560","10998360"," Still I still don't feel confident buying this or selling this"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","10998920","11004760"," So after you've done those two steps, right? You're like watching the short videos on youtube and you and you're watching the"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11005880","11009000"," The long videos and options industry console your third step"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11009800","11012680"," As I want you to download fucking options dot ai"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11014440","11016920"," And we'll do a video on just options dot ai"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11018200","11020200"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11020200","11022200"," We'll do a video on it because"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11023160","11025160"," I want you to see to visualize"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11026120","11029720"," Because it's when I first started learning. I was like man. I have no fucking clue what they mean"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11029720","11034600"," I was like I was like I get it conceptually I get it, but I still have no fucking idea what they're talking about"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11035960","11040360"," Right, so I'm like, what is this by a call a solid car? No fucking clue. What do you mean? I need a margin account?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11040360","11042360"," Sometimes you don't sometimes you do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11042600","11044600"," um"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11045480","11050200"," Some some some brokers don't require margin accounts for some for I don't know why"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11050520","11056200"," Uh for some spreads and then some require like you can't trade any spread on tasty unless you have a margin account"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11056600","11058920"," So like I have a cash account and it's an margin account"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11059000","11062680"," I have keep two separate accounts on tasty trade to place trades"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11063560","11065560"," And the margin account is for"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11065560","11067240"," uh trading spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11067240","11069240"," But you can get fucked"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11069240","11073800"," But anyways the the first place to learn how to actually execute them believe it or not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11074440","11076440"," I would execute them on robin hood"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11077080","11079080"," I hate robin hood, but robin hood"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11079480","11084520"," You can uh open and close legs of spreads in robin hood easily"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11085080","11089240"," Okay, so I would you I would plot and plan on options that I I believe or not"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11089560","11093720"," And then I would execute on robin hood and then once you get once you just get the feel for them"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11094120","11099880"," How they move how they how they don't move then you'll switch over to like a tasty or your favorite broker"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11100040","11102040"," That's a legit fucking broker"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11102600","11105880"," A legit fucking broker and then you can relearn how to really maximize"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11106440","11112040"," Uh your gains you don't need all those gains in the beginning. You just need to understand the mechanics of how they fucking work"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11113640","11116680"," Just the mechanics like the the hard fast mechanics"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11117160","11120040"," Of spreads and then you build from there. You'll then you graduate"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11120440","11124280"," You're like fuck this cap. You're right. I'm getting out of fucking robin hood because they get shitty fucking fills"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11124760","11129640"," I can't get anyone to fucking sell to and I got to do it at the mo at these moments and blah blah blah"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11130200","11133160"," They're from there. You're gonna have the basics down then you move order tasty trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11133560","11136360"," Some some kind of broker like that and you'll you'll start to uh"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11137000","11140120"," Execute your trades there and you'll have a firm grasp of what's going on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11140680","11142680"," That's my best thing I can give you guys"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11142840","11145000"," Tasty's fucking dope dude when it comes to spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11149080","11151080"," Uh that's not true"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11152120","11153480"," That's not true"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11153480","11157720"," Uh you can trade spreads on uh, I think you can trade spreads"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11158440","11164120"," on like robin hood. I think on option is AI you can too. I think I'll think of a lot of these like fucking"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11164840","11171000"," Uh gamified fucking brokerages. They'll give you a cash count and then you trade them. I'm not positive on that"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11171640","11173320"," But I think they do"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11173320","11176520"," I don't think they give you unless you're maybe you are signing up for a margin account"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11176520","11179480"," You just don't know it or something. I think robin hood just a cash count"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11180040","11184280"," You can execute those trades. Don't quote me on that, but i'm almost hundred percent sure you can"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11185080","11187080"," almost hundred percent sure"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11187400","11192440"," That they're doing that they're allowing fucking traders to do that shit, but just fucked up. Don't get me wrong"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11192920","11194920"," That shit's fucked up"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11195240","11200120"," There's a reason for that now. That's why you get a margin call on your fucking spread you're getting butt fucked"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11201560","11205240"," Absolutely butt fucked. There's some rules there. I'll give I'll put a video out for you guys"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11205640","11211160"," Because there's some hard and fast fucking rules like you want to want to be trading on fucking tickers with dividends"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11211560","11215560"," You don't want to be ever trading around time when they get announced dividends. It's like let's see"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11216200","11219080"," Let's say like i'm gonna buy i'm gonna buy fucking uh disney"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11219480","11223480"," Want to buy some fucking disney spreads, right? This is a prime example actually before we hang up here, right?"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11224040","11226040"," the prime example"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11226200","11228200"," So if you're a fucking bion"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11228520","11231800"," If you're so disney at one point, I think in 2020 or some"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11232440","11236280"," They announced they said we're not doing dividends. I think it was disney"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11236920","11239960"," One of these companies was disney. They were like we're not doing dividends and shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11240360","11242520"," The moment that you hear we're not doing dividends"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11242920","11247000"," And you know that they ain't doing any dividends for the next three fucking months. No matter what"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11247640","11249640"," You can go in there and play spreads all day long"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11250200","11254680"," Because it because if they announced a fucking dividend they've come busting out some fucking dividend bullshit you're fucked"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11256840","11263880"," There's some other there's other things like um like you want you want to be settling the cash because you can get a margin call"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11264520","11266520"," Right at any fucking time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11267320","11269320"," Any fucking time"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11269320","11273240"," Any fucking time right you can get a margin call but when you settle to cash"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11273720","11276680"," Like spy does you tend not to get margin calls"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11277320","11279320"," You tend not to"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11279320","11285240"," You tend not to and they tend to let them uh trade into into or or expire worthless"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11285720","11291160"," Options on the spy cash options, but you will see motherfuckers trying to own fucking disney"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11291640","11295000"," You will see motherfuckers trying to own home depot and that kind of shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11295000","11297960"," You'll see some ricky retarder. What there shouldn't be saying that shit"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11298360","11302680"," To see some fucking guy out there and be like i'm gonna fucking execute these motherfuckers right now"

"KwoWW8RhjI4","11312680","11315880"," Well, it doesn't matter. I know it's gonna bounce right here and i'm gonna make my money back"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11317080","11320920"," Specifically that happens on fucking um, I think it when they mostly happens on"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11321480","11324600"," Uh credit spreads where you really get fucked on those trades"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11325240","11329400"," And then some other problems too because sometimes you're they'll close you out on one leg of your trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11329960","11331480"," Your broker will"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11331480","11334120"," And it'll show that you're like super fucking upside down on the trade"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11334200","11336040"," They'll leave the other leg open for you"
"KwoWW8RhjI4","11336040","11339720"," And then like you'll over the weekend will come and it's gonna show that you're like"
