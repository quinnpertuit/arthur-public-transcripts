"6600","7720"," I was really bizarre."
"8560","11040"," Like a, like a power search stream, kick in."
"19520","22860"," It's what it's like being a streamer and not a video maker. "
"35100","37940"," Yeah, you'll load three hours of cloud data."
"42600","44280"," We lost all our data from this morning as well."
"54160","56020"," Okay, restore some stuff here. "
"56340","59200"," Like, we lost a whole bunch of data and information."
"73640","74820"," Doesn't get real time."
"83240","84540"," Or is choppy. "
"85220","86420"," Please read over our support page."
"87540","88600"," They get some weird shit going on."
"93400","94660"," We'll see if they come back or not. "
"98860","105180"," It comes from Feds and George now saying that balance sheet is influencing the shape of the yield"
"105180","105540"," curve."
"105760","111180"," It's appropriate to expeditiously raise rates to neutral soft landing is possible, but not"
"111180","112500"," guarantees as George."
"114160","120320"," I had a guaranteed size needs to decline significantly since George says she favors the steady and"
"120320","124620"," deliberate approach and the rate path rolling off the fed assets. "
"126120","129220"," Holdings could help steepen the curves as George."
"130940","134300"," It's more restrictive policy, maybe needed to cool prices."
"141710","143570"," George, I think inflation is still high. "
"144010","146990"," When they reach a neutral funds rate, more hikes will be needed."
"157680","162660"," George saying that they can't take stock of the outlook once they reach a neutral rate."
"163140","167400"," Again saying that if inflation remains high when they're neutral, more hikes will be needed. "
"167400","174970"," Getting cut off by Charlie over here."
"182490","190410"," It's like all those condor and butterfly buyers are making money today, huh?"
"196090","197030"," I'm getting hacked."
"199370","199850"," I was getting. "
"200810","209970"," Yeah, I turned off yesterday's stream because I want to tone down the number of people that"
"209970","210190"," request."
"210290","212270"," To do the $1,000 trade."
"212990","213790"," So I deleted it. "
"215730","220590"," I was I was I was a close personal confidant said that I should."
"221530","226510"," Just my defense for which is an FOMC voter this year and is considered hawkish."
"231850","232670"," I was. "
"232670","242570"," A close confidant said you should probably delete that video from yesterday because"
"242570","245950"," you don't want too many people going back to it and trying to request to get into the trade."
"245990","248470"," So I was like, yeah, it makes sense because it doesn't have people."
"248810","250130"," We have enough people in that trade. "
"250370","250490"," So."
"254710","256490"," So just grinding over here, right?"
"256709","258190"," Just the intraday kill trading."
"258570","260110"," This is just killing the spy today. "
"260110","264250"," I kind of seen seen a lot of that in the market."
"266770","269790"," I was looking at some other small milk on the wrong side here."
"270590","273270"," I was checking out some of the tickers that were green today. "
"273770","279170"," Santa crowd strike already blasted up, but I was checking that in the stock screener."
"279630","283850"," Now you can go through and check them all and see if any of them look like the work for"
"283850","284150"," you."
"287160","290300"," See if I'm using out checking out a stock screen that I have. "
"290300","291540"," We've got a few of them I use."
"295040","296600"," Here's another good one that I use right here."
"296700","298860"," This is some of you have to use this one. "
"300300","307160"," So this Finviz screen array, a 20% moving average price above SMA floats short over 5% for today's"
"307160","308760"," civil moving average price above SMA."
"311620","315680"," Average volume over 5,000 IPO date in the last three years."
"315740","322420"," The leg above this one here is, if I pay you in the past three years, they're a growth company. "
"323060","329100"," You know, you hear about the bitching all the time on social media that they don't produce anything"
"329100","329960"," these companies."
"330440","333620"," Some of them have sales growth quarter over quarter you can use."
"334100","336180"," This is over 30% quarter over quarter. "
"336180","341340"," I always recommend when you use the screener to do the due diligence on it and change from open is"
"341340","341960"," up, right?"
"343100","346440"," I usually get a few tickers in here."
"347160","348920"," Data Dog is on this one right now."
"349260","350620"," Net is on this one right now. "
"351240","352220"," Nari is on this one."
"352720","353420"," Check is on this one."
"353700","354480"," Bros is on this one. "
"355500","358760"," LFG is on this one and then BLDE is on this one."
"358760","360440"," We're going to think about this specifically."
"361300","364040"," I don't always find, you know, exactly one on this. "
"364640","368380"," But if you go back and do due diligence in these companies, we'll look at a few of these right"
"368380","370220"," now as well for some differences."
"371340","376160"," You guys are always trying to catch knives."
"378140","380780"," And I'm not really always interested in catching knives. "
"381580","382800"," Matter of fact, it's a nice rule over here."
"383620","389380"," What I'm really looking for is, this one might have already traded out, but even so, I'm looking"
"389380","391000"," for these dip buys down here."
"392220","396200"," And for them, instead of catching knives saying they're actually going up right now. "
"396580","401240"," I always want to see that on a ticker that's going up rather than catching this nonsense down here"
"401240","402980"," and catching the wrong knife."
"404020","411260"," If you're buying a dip while it's moving up, you can usually catch a decent dip for an intraday or"
"411260","412640"," a two day or three day play here."
"412800","415220"," This one's looking a little exhausted or getting close to exhausted. "
"416720","419860"," You know, there's going to be some resistance above right where we are in Datadog."
"421360","423980"," So I typically have to go through a few of them to find one that's working."
"425620","429140"," Currently, you can see nets already kind of overextended here as well. "
"429420","432080"," So net was on that list and we'll look at Nari next."
"432960","439060"," And I'll usually take a quick look at some of these companies and look for support and a trend."
"439060","443170"," I actually like this right here. "
"443410","444390"," I like Nari here."
"444970","450230"," I like the fact that the dips keep being bought on Nari and then they keep getting sold above."
"452070","454130"," So you can set some alerts up here. "
"456230","459410"," So that if you ever come back down and touch down below here, you'll get an alert."
"459590","466030"," So this one right here, I'd be looking for adding an alert at $77.22, anything below it."
"466390","469970"," And if it does bounce below down here, I'll take a peek at it and see if I can buy"
"469970","470910"," it for another rip higher. "
"471270","472550"," Same thing for selling the rips."
"473170","475930"," If you're a bear, this would be a great place to be above here."
"475990","477930"," It'd be a great place to start thinking about a short down. "
"478410","480590"," I also like the idea that this one's been consolidating."
"481070","482730"," I like seeing a move like this."
"483350","483790"," Hold on here. "
"485570","486170"," Come back."
"486590","488510"," I like seeing this right here, right?"
"488770","493430"," One, two, three, four, and then five and then six."
"493430","495270"," That's a really nice run for Nari. "
"495510","496630"," So keep that one on your list."
"496710","498830"," I like that one for buying and selling."
"501330","502750"," CHK, Chesapeake Energy. "
"503710","505890"," This one looks like it's already played out, doesn't it?"
"506330","507230"," Kind of missed this one."
"507350","511590"," This is a beautiful one down here at 48, just kept trending higher, traded all at $90."
"512929","515730"," So I probably wouldn't be interested in CHK. "
"516450","517370"," We'll look at BROS."
"518990","521950"," I'll track these over time here."
"522650","526830"," And we've got Dutch brothers over here, like this one a lot too. "
"528790","530350"," Like this one a lot, a lot."
"531530","533170"," One's trading higher on the day two."
"537560","538980"," Blasting higher, right?"
"539340","541880"," One down, pushed up, pushed up. "
"542720","548520"," I'm probably going to be looking for something down in here for a grab."
"549900","551540"," This might actually trade nicely today."
"554600","559840"," I'm really looking for some failures on this as well, right there. "
"561840","568940"," For another failure above, somewhere in there."
"576810","577590"," Somewhere in there."
"577730","579490"," I like all this pushing that's going on, right?"
"580090","582110"," You guys are always trying to catch this stuff over here. "
"582670","586190"," You guys are always like, hey, Cap, can you look at this stock as it's going like this all the"
"586190","586390"," way down."
"586410","590710"," And meanwhile, you should be grabbing stocks that are heading up, right?"
"590910","592130"," You got another move up here."
"593170","595510"," So we're trying to buy dips on the way up. "
"595710","597170"," You can see it's trending up right now."
"598730","600410"," So I like brothers as well."
"603030","605190"," We'll get another one over here, LFG. "
"609150","612150"," Something looks like it's already made, it's moved, but I'd be interested in this."
"613690","615250"," $13 is already at $22."
"617950","619330"," I like the push. "
"620130","623050"," I would always do due diligence on this as well."
"623470","624250"," What's good about this?"
"624370","625210"," Let's say look at this one, right?"
"625930","627550"," So do some due diligence on these companies."
"628070","629570"," Find out why it's moving higher. "
"629830","631410"," You see how it's consistently going up?"
"632270","635270"," LFG, you could have another year left to it going up."
"635890","638810"," It started out at $9, it's only at $22."
"639470","640930"," So you go to $40, believe it or not. "
"641470","643350"," So find out what's going on with this company."
"643350","646510"," Why is it being pushed by banks, right?"
"647050","649950"," It's only $22, throw a hundred bucks at it and let it run."
"650070","651070"," I wouldn't buy it here at $22. "
"651630","659050"," But if it comes back down and does any dipping below here, around like $20, $20 flat or so, you"
"659050","663050"," could pick this ticker up on a market down day or week."
"664590","665910"," I keep an eye on this one."
"665970","666430"," This is a good one. "
"666610","668350"," I like this one because it just keeps going up."
"672320","674620"," And then we'll look at a Blade B over here."
"674620","676300"," It's in a bank that's still in the Moscow Exchange. "
"676520","678980"," We'll trade shares for full day on Thursday."
"680380","681560"," Blade air mobility."
"683020","685500"," Let's take a look at this one over the course of a year. "
"686340","687440"," I like this one too, right?"
"687740","689760"," I really like seeing stuff like this over time."
"691480","695540"," You've got another looks like by the dippers are here."
"700560","700860"," And here. "
"701680","706400"," All right, trades down, up, push for profit, up, push for profit."
"706980","710020"," It was way back down to $5 and now it's making its way back higher here."
"710860","714140"," It looks like it's breaking through some resistance above. "
"715420","721020"," You might have some sellers hiding just above at $9.10. And then you might have, you'd have some"
"721020","721660"," consolidation."
"722200","731090"," Then the next move up would be somewhere in here, somewhere in here, some pissed off."
"731670","740180"," $9.33. And pissed off bag holders up in here, somewhere in there. "
"740380","741020"," But I do like this."
"741220","742760"," I like setting alert down here."
"742860","748460"," If it ever comes back down here, creating alert at $6.38. Above. "
"749020","752560"," And this one right here, creating alert below."
"754120","758260"," Another great ticker to buy, buy and hold and sell 100% profit in each one of these trades."
"761470","763170"," One, two, three. "
"763790","766470"," And they're looking to take some profit probably up around 10 bucks."
"767150","770750"," Probably in long since five or six bucks for this next leg up on blade."
"774370","776090"," So this stock screen, I'll show it to you more time. "
"777610","784910"," And these are identifying companies that are moving up and have had great sales growth over quarter"
"784910","785330"," over quarter."
"786030","787730"," I usually do one last test on these."
"787730","794650"," I just check their last guidance on their last report and see what they're projecting for the next"
"794650","796350"," three months or the next of the year. "
"796990","797710"," See what they're expecting."
"797990","800570"," They've got great fundamentals."
"802070","804970"," You can even check their PE as well, their Ford PEs. "
"805150","808930"," You can add that to it as well if they're trading higher than their PE or not."
"809730","811630"," And these are some great companies you can seek out."
"820530","823490"," Yeah, I don't ever recommend these companies unless you look into them. "
"824070","825450"," So you have to look into them."
"825450","827110"," You have to do your due diligence on these companies."
"838460","842760"," Rush central bank is saying that the Moscow exchange will trade chairs for a full day until 1850"
"842760","843980"," local time on Thursday. "
"845140","848460"," I don't know if they're going to I don't think they're going to open up our sex to the US"
"848460","850100"," or have they yet haven't checked recently."
"851400","856440"," See if they're going to open up their exchange here in the US."
"856440","859420"," We still have this support line down below at 458. "
"860320","861580"," That's hit nice down below."
"861740","862560"," You can kind of see it here."
"864780","866680"," It's starting to show up right down here. "
"866780","869160"," There's some more down here at 457 of buyers."
"869440","874820"," If we break 457 at any point, you should see a run lower to this 455."
"875320","876480"," And this is what we projected right. "
"876680","878220"," This is the outer trading range for the day."
"879000","879940"," 455 of the spy."
"885880","889740"," We'll keep our minds open to that trade happening as the day wears on. "
"891440","892080"," I'll be back."
"900220","902260"," Is it throttled to 720p?"
"902980","906280"," Willy, are you seeing this broadcast only in 720p or can you not change it?"
"918140","920900"," Are you saying the broadcast is coming in at 720p?"
"921740","924960"," Let me check if it's just your broadcast."
"926800","932020"," It should be at 1080p, 60 frames per second. "
"963250","965250"," 720p is the max on settings right now."
"966610","967670"," That's not good."
"979130","981610"," It says 720p, 60 frames per second. "
"989270","992130"," I might be having internet problems on my end."
"992350","994730"," I had a power surge in my house."
"995690","997990"," And my power flicked on and off. "
"998150","1000250"," I'm assuming that my internet kicked off as well."
"1001350","1006890"," I'm wondering if I'm having problems on my internet side of things."
"1007230","1010750"," Because I broadcast in 1080p, 60 frames per second. "
"1011230","1012030"," Let's take a look and see."
"1018480","1019360"," Let me take a look."
"1019600","1022200"," It must be this probably on my end. "
"1027010","1027829"," Hold on here."
"1050740","1054780"," In my end, I'm streaming at 1080p."
"1057480","1062660"," That means I'm having problems with my internet on my end. "
"1071860","1072980"," I run it all."
"1073560","1074440"," It always runs at 1080p."
"1074560","1077360"," I just had a power surge in my house. "
"1079340","1082340"," I'm wondering if it has something to do with the internet fucked up for the day or something."
"1089720","1091200"," I'm normally at 1080p."
"1092780","1094680"," There's definitely something happening in my end. "
"1095680","1098080"," If you want to shut it down and restart it again."
"1098340","1099160"," Would you prefer that I do that?"
"1100940","1103000"," I can shut the stream down and restart it one more time."
"1112180","1114280"," We'll let the stream run today at 720p. "
"1115200","1116420"," I'll call my ISP."
"1117180","1122500"," What I'll do is check with my internet stream provider."
"1122500","1124980"," My ISP today and see what took place. "
"1125120","1126340"," I'll give them a call and find out what happened."
"1127880","1129460"," I shouldn't be at 720p."
"1129620","1132860"," If I'm streaming right now at 720p, something's going on with my internet. "
"1163630","1164850"," I've had that happen."
"1164850","1175220"," I've had it on"
"1181720","1183440"," my end here."
"1183600","1187720"," When I monitor it on another computer, I get it at 1080p, 60 frames per second. "
"1188120","1191340"," I know definitely downstream it comes in at 1080p."
"1192380","1196340"," If it's only at 720p on your end, it could be..."
"1200700","1203760"," It always streams at 1080p on my end."
"1203760","1204500"," I'll take a look. "
"1206180","1207420"," You know what else could have happened?"
"1209000","1212560"," I had to reset this OBS up three times."
"1213120","1216220"," I could have even fucked up the settings myself down to 720p."
"1216260","1220240"," If it's something that I'm throttling in my end, I'll take a look at it today once the stream is"
"1220240","1220460"," over. "
"1221240","1223360"," When I typically stream at 1080p, I have no issues."
"1224060","1225720"," I've got a fiber here at my house now."
"1226760","1230080"," I should have no issues streaming at 1080p. "
"1241570","1242970"," It could be me."
"1244870","1248710"," It's either my intern service provider or it's some setting that I fucked with."
"1249030","1251290"," I was messing around with it. "
"1254260","1255420"," I'll be back."
"1255580","1257240"," I'm going back to the work that I was doing."
"1258840","1264260"," You guys can see that Spy is not doing anything right now. "
"1264740","1266660"," Just side to side, side to side."
"1267080","1267920"," No movements."
"1269300","1270340"," Absolutely nothing. "
"1270340","1275360"," If anything is happening right now, it's selling for profit on big tickers, right?"
"1279310","1283070"," Lots of put buying coming into the market and they're just burning."
"1284190","1288850"," Any calls or any puts coming in the market are just getting burnt right now, torched."
"1290810","1293810"," I'm going to assume that people don't understand what's going on in the market. "
"1293930","1295790"," I'm going to assume that people don't understand what's going on."
"1297910","1298570"," That's okay."
"1299010","1299850"," That's what it is. "
"1441050","1446050"," That's Georgetown Q&A saying Fed policy will have to be decisive and deliberate."
"1467160","1467640"," That's Georgetown."
"1467640","1471160"," His economy is operating in a strong fashion. "
"1501220","1505060"," That's George putting the neutral rate at around two and a half percent as a starting point."
"1846220","1848740"," That's George saying as evaluations have been elevated."
"1956410","1959430"," That's George saying partial real estate is something she is watching. "
"1971890","1974590"," You're trying to make this move down and touch this four feet."
"1974590","1976150"," Everybody's been looking for all day long today."
"1976310","1977290"," We'll see if we can get down here. "
"1978790","1985050"," This range of volatility, buyers, at least right buyers, sellers looking for a dip to buy."
"1986450","1989970"," The bulls are definitely looking for a dip to buy somewhere down here."
"1990710","1992490"," This 458 zone looks nice. "
"1992810","1996590"," Then there's some more real money down below here, 456."
"1997570","2004130"," Still not seeing any pricing in the market of a dip to lower than 455."
"2007430","2010070"," See some buyers down here, 456. "
"2013390","2017900"," And buyers waiting down below here."
"2021020","2028620"," Still not seeing much movement in the spy currently trading slightly sideways and down over time."
"2029120","2030640"," This little bump down below. "
"2031380","2036360"," We know about our one above."
"2036500","2038520"," This is resistance support currently."
"2039000","2040720"," It's not this line right here. "
"2040800","2042620"," This is where I was looking at."
"2045200","2045720"," Excuse me."
"2048120","2048620"," Excuse me. "
"2048719","2051159"," This was our one right here, 45750."
"2052940","2053600"," Right here."
"2054020","2055020"," This line right here. "
"2057340","2060179"," I threw it in there for a support line that was on book map."
"2060900","2063000"," But we're still looking for some support buys down here."
"2063159","2066159"," S1, S2, see if we can get down here, a dip down here. "
"2066320","2069620"," But until that happens, I haven't been in a trade today."
"2070440","2071980"," I was asked that earlier."
"2074020","2079540"," I'm not willing to get this meat grinder of theta and theta burn. "
"2080139","2085699"," If we do trade down here today, S1, S2, I might grab a long here."
"2085900","2089800"," If I can't grab it here, I'll be waiting for tomorrow as well."
"2089960","2094840"," And I'll give this until Friday to see if we can catch some kind of a dip down here. "
"2094840","2101060"," Because I am anticipating a move higher into the 31st expiry."
"2101280","2102200"," I might miss it, too."
"2102600","2103080"," That's the thing. "
"2103240","2104740"," Buyers can step in at any time."
"2105780","2111800"," I don't think that sellers can push this market, roll this market over at this point in its"
"2111800","2112280"," process."
"2113320","2119420"," So if you are taking shorts here, keep them short, you know, like, keep them for very small"
"2119420","2119840"," moments. "
"2120660","2125480"," Don't be trying to hold them, diamond hand them, because this is a meat grinder for bears and bulls"
"2125480","2125980"," right here."
"2128060","2129900"," Now, full on meat grinder."
"2130880","2134060"," You know, this does look like they could roll right here. "
"2134200","2138880"," You can see that the number of buyers, there's more sellers now above."
"2139820","2141220"," And the buyers are way up here."
"2141320","2141700"," They're already in. "
"2141840","2143020"," They get kind of getting ground up."
"2144500","2147420"," But I'm not seeing anything seriously looking at here."
"2147420","2150540"," I might take a gander at, like, 458. "
"2152220","2154960"," We get down to 458, like, down here, maybe."
"2155300","2156360"," I might take a shot at it."
"2158500","2162140"," There's some buyers stepping in down here at, like, 458, 70. "
"2163520","2166320"," Still some weight down here for serious buying down below."
"2166900","2169360"," If this firms up at all, I'll think about taking a trade."
"2169600","2171000"," But I haven't been in a trade all day long today. "
"2171960","2174920"," I feel like I feel like you get ground up in these days."
"2175500","2178480"," Like, I try to pick something up and then it snaps back too quick."
"2178800","2181600"," Or I'm scalping for, like, 10%. "
"2183700","2186320"," So I'm not really interested in this right now."
"2186420","2188000"," It's that same area right down there."
"2188420","2189400"," You can see it right there. "
"2190160","2191020"," There's a 458."
"2191260","2192140"," I'm just waiting for it."
"2192800","2194020"," There's some buyers in here. "
"2195600","2198900"," Now, if you are bearish here, look for reaction at 458."
"2199240","2199860"," Keep that on your radar."
"2215900","2217560"," That's that little zone right down there. "
"2229580","2230420"," And I'll be back."
"2235630","2237390"," So my thoughts on UVXY."
"2240990","2242490"," My thoughts on UVXY. "
"2242710","2243270"," This is the VIX."
"2243450","2244350"," This is a UVXY."
"2244570","2248230"," You can see the VIX trading sideways today. "
"2249690","2252490"," And there's a ton of gamma on the market."
"2252830","2253150"," Call gamma."
"2253150","2260230"," And what that does is it, what it's doing is it's, it's got like a, it's got like a, a"
"2260230","2261070"," grab hold. "
"2261470","2262790"," I'm trying to make this simple for you."
"2263590","2266330"," It's limiting volatility in the market."
"2266610","2269850"," All these calls that are on the market that don't roll off until Friday. "
"2270870","2274930"," And so it's not allowing the market to move down."
"2275370","2278710"," It's not allowing expansion on the market."
"2279290","2284150"," So you're going to need to see massive put buying that could outweigh those calls. "
"2284570","2289430"," We looked at a dot pot earlier in the week that just showed the concentration of calls above"
"2290250","2291550"," between 460 and 470."
"2293030","2298350"," And until those calls roll off, they don't get replaced or we don't add to those calls, we're not"
"2298350","2299210"," going to roll the market over."
"2299370","2300530"," And we're not going to go higher either. "
"2301870","2304090"," So you're going to see that same constriction of the VIX."
"2304970","2307730"," If you wanted to be like, hey, capture that by the VIX."
"2309350","2312370"," It gets more, I guess you could buy the actual VIX. "
"2313410","2315510"," Maybe you're going to buy calls or something like that."
"2316450","2323410"," You have to, can you wait for three to four days of not knowing that we're not going to add"
"2323410","2331090"," calls to the market or we're not going to rotate in other stocks in the market or trade or just,"
"2331250","2332710"," or slowly melt up in the market."
"2332710","2334570"," You can't answer those questions right now. "
"2335170","2341950"," So just by buying the VIX today is a risky proposition because you're going to kill the intrinsic"
"2341950","2345690"," value and any calls that you have on the VIX over the next two or three days."
"2346890","2349850"," So I don't think this, I think this is the time when you get ground up."
"2350510","2355290"," This is in the VIX and in the regular market and there's no definitive direction in the market yet. "
"2355890","2359690"," You could get a move either way at some point and you don't have to catch the entire move."
"2359690","2365310"," So if you're looking to buy the VIX or even sell the VIX, there's no real answer to that currently"
"2365310","2365950"," at the moment."
"2366930","2368690"," The VIX is pinned right now. "
"2368770","2372490"," Foreign ministers and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have not advanced."
"2373910","2377510"," The VIX is being pinned right now because of the number of calls in the market."
"2378230","2385070"," And you won't see a move higher unless you see calls coming in for like, you know, 4800, 4750 in"
"2385070","2385330"," mass. "
"2387090","2389690"," Or you see a waterfall of hedging and puts."
"2390050","2393150"," The original puts that came in, those are dated from May, right?"
"2393290","2393930"," They're down the road."
"2394310","2400210"," You guys want to remember too, when we were trading down and heavy and hard, we were seeing hedging"
"2400210","2402470"," coming in that was two weeks out, one week out. "
"2402970","2410050"," We saw hedging coming in that was, you know, very quick or very close and millions and millions and"
"2410050","2412370"," millions and millions of dollars coming."
"2412370","2416790"," When you don't see that flow coming in right now with the number of calls in the market, that's"
"2416790","2418410"," where my talk this morning was about."
"2419450","2423410"," I think it was trade takes put out of post last night about all the puts that came in the"
"2423410","2425050"," market and they were irrelevant. "
"2425350","2425910"," They mean nothing."
"2426390","2428610"," They have no context in this market right now."
"2429490","2434970"," As a matter of fact, there's no impact from them until over time, if we don't add calls to the"
"2434970","2436650"," market, they all bleed off. "
"2437230","2443250"," Or if they all bleed off and we're just buying zero dates and what three dates calls the market"
"2443250","2447130"," that are in the money, you can still prop this market up for another week or two or three weeks"
"2447130","2449250"," or four weeks into May."
"2449510","2456250"," So without context, those puts that are put into the market, those those hedges for out May really"
"2456250","2457610"," don't impact the market right now."
"2457870","2464550"," They're just sitting there as a safety net as an actual hedge in case that that moment happens. "
"2464550","2469710"," So yeah, I guess if you want to buy some VIX two months out, three months out, sure, you could"
"2469710","2471150"," buy some calls, I guess two or three months."
"2471290","2474110"," I don't know what an expiration is, but you get my point, right?"
"2474790","2476510"," There's nothing you can really do right now."
"2476810","2481510"," If you're in VIX right now, you're pinned and there's nothing you can do unless there's some"
"2481510","2484190"," headline news, like major impactful news. "
"2485730","2490850"," Or you have some massive call buying you get fucked, right?"
"2491210","2495930"," And if you had massive put buying that they would print, we're not seeing that in the market right"
"2495930","2496190"," now."
"2496430","2499010"," And you have to understand these calls are still in the market."
"2500190","2504890"," There's a strangle or there's a strangle out there on the market until Friday. "
"2505750","2508030"," And they're more than likely going to ensure those print on Friday."
"2508030","2516750"," So I don't see any movement in either direction today, tomorrow, or even Friday, unless some major"
"2516750","2518710"," moves come into the market that we haven't seen yet."
"2519090","2520410"," And all that information is available. "
"2520650","2522290"," You can watch the options flow come in."
"2522570","2525250"," You can watch real money selling in real time."
"2525890","2527310"," You can watch hedging come in. "
"2528330","2530350"," Prop desk throwing puts on top of hedge flow."
"2530730","2532550"," We just haven't seen that yet this market."
"2532550","2537710"," This looks more like institutions taking profit off the table for the move higher. "
"2537970","2538510"," That takes time."
"2539090","2543990"," This also looks like while they're doing that, they're looking at their basket of pin stocks and"
"2543990","2545010"," rotating into those stocks."
"2545550","2549950"," There's some rotation into commodities and metals as well going on. "
"2550830","2551810"," So this can take time."
"2552030","2554370"," This process can take seven days."
"2554710","2555650"," It can take three weeks. "
"2556190","2561250"," So just be like gun and saying, we're going to roll this bitch over or this market over doom and"
"2561250","2563350"," gloom shit that you hear on Twitter."
"2563850","2567130"," You know, inverted yield curves like anything I'm hearing out there."
"2567150","2573130"," I'm just like, I'm not a one here because the actual internals of the market are disagreeing with"
"2573130","2573350"," that. "
"2574070","2576370"," This like, this like complete roll off."
"2576870","2579490"," We shouldn't be down here at $18 and 68 cents."
"2579490","2581690"," All the bullshit about, I don't know. "
"2581910","2587790"," I heard yesterday everything being talked about the VXX shit that went on."
"2588110","2588810"," We knew about that."
"2588930","2591350"," We even talked about it here in the stream before it happened the day before. "
"2592050","2593850"," So it's like we didn't know what was going to happen."
"2594530","2595490"," The fee of the VIX fiasco."
"2596310","2597350"," I thought that was kind of funny too. "
"2599570","2600970"," It's not like it was unknown or anything."
"2601410","2603890"," In a matter of fact, the day it happened, people were like, what's going on in the market?"
"2604550","2607530"," And I think I was like, how do these people not know what's happening?"
"2607530","2610270"," I think even spot gamma brought it up before it took place."
"2610830","2612770"," So it's not like people didn't know what was going to happen. "
"2613290","2616030"," And then they're trying to tie that into where we are right now."
"2616270","2617750"," And it's just tied to gamma right now."
"2618090","2622850"," The market's trading sideways because gamma is on, call gamma is in the market right now. "
"2623850","2631450"," It's very similar to when we traded down to, when we traded down to, when we traded down to, when"
"2631450","2633230"," we traded down to, we'll look right here."
"2635410","2640250"," So both times when we traded down to, to these levels down below, this is the exact same thing,"
"2640570","2641050"," just inverse."
"2641550","2646420"," So when we were down, when we were down here, right?"
"2648340","2653720"," We're in the same position as we are, as we are right here is the same position we were down"
"2653720","2654000"," here. "
"2654360","2663640"," So we had these moments down in the market where there was a ton of puts down here, right?"
"2666120","2668520"," Hold on, let me hold on a second."
"2670540","2672260"," Use the example, a better example."
"2672540","2673660"," Sometimes I'm tired of talking about something. "
"2674120","2675000"," I'm not too tired right now."
"2675620","2680760"," So this is in the inverse of your bear, okay?"
"2681140","2684300"," So we've got a ton of puts get taken out."
"2684800","2686240"," Let's say some puts get taken out. "
"2686700","2687800"," Let's say this is how it starts."
"2688440","2691320"," You start out with some puts, you buy some puts down here."
"2691320","2694380"," Let's just theoretically say about some puts at 4.30, okay?"
"2696600","2701840"," We're not going to print these puts at 4.30. Now if another group comes in and they buy puts"
"2701840","2705400"," at 4.10, let's say, right?"
"2705860","2708680"," We'll actually start trading down to the 4.30 at that point. "
"2709440","2713280"," And then if more people start buying puts down here at 3.90 or so, right?"
"2713400","2716780"," There's a chance we continue to, this is, I'm very, I'm simplifying this."
"2717340","2719080"," We can trade down to this level here, right?"
"2719080","2725300"," Now another problem is, as we're making these lower lows, you need more bag buyers."
"2725600","2732420"," You need someone to come in and we're down here at 4.20. And they start buying, there's already"
"2732420","2734060"," some 3.90s down here, let's say, right?"
"2734620","2739300"," We need more people to buy 3.90s to buy these people's bags, right?"
"2739880","2742300"," So that we can start to continue to trade lower and lower and lower. "
"2742740","2747860"," I don't know if I'm mixing a mumbo jumbo in this for you, but let me explain it on the"
"2747860","2748520"," upside here."
"2750520","2760140"," So right now, there's some initial calls that were placed for"
"2760140","2765940"," 4650s and there's some 4750s, there's some calls up here, right?"
"2766920","2768000"," And these are called bag holders."
"2768720","2773000"," So these are people that bought a bunch of calls that they want to see print up here, right?"
"2774800","2776280"," And how do we get up here?"
"2776280","2781400"," We need a second round of call buyers to come in and be like, yeah, we're going to 4.70,"
"2781560","2788280"," we're going to 4.80. So they come up here and they start buying calls up here, right?"
"2789040","2791660"," And as we start, excuse me, I'm mixing this up here. "
"2792580","2794940"," It's got a bunch of call holders up in here."
"2796160","2802800"," What we really need is people that we buy in like 4.75 to 4.85, so they step in,"
"2802880","2803060"," right?"
"2803760","2809400"," And as we trade up here to this next level, these original call holders, they cash out, they take"
"2809400","2810200"," their money and run."
"2810760","2814140"," And this next group here is saying, oh my God, are we ever getting a 4.80 or not?"
"2816720","2823420"," And if we don't get another round of call buyers to step in and buy 4.80s, then these bag"
"2823420","2826780"," holders will never be able to cash out of their calls, right?"
"2826940","2827820"," So that's what we're waiting for. "
"2828260","2832320"," We're waiting for like that next round of call buyers to step in so that we can keep making legs"
"2832320","2833560"," up, right?"
"2833560","2837140"," Now let's say none of these call holders step in, right?"
"2837500","2841660"," None of these new groups step in from this last group right here, right?"
"2842380","2845000"," And these people over here, they never materialize, right?"
"2845580","2850320"," What you're looking at is a bunch of bag holders, and they're sitting up here waiting to get their"
"2850320","2851980"," calls printed up higher."
"2852160","2856360"," President Biden's saying the US will not be able to sustain COVID testing beyond June without more"
"2856360","2858000"," funding from Congress."
"2858000","2865120"," Now their calls are starting to expire, not all of them, but there's a good like 50% of them"
"2865120","2866320"," are going to expire on Friday. "
"2867740","2870020"," And that's what's pinning the market right now, okay?"
"2870380","2872940"," Now the moment that these calls expire, right?"
"2873140","2879580"," The other 50% are still out there, but this 50% pulls the game off and it allows an"
"2879580","2885480"," expansion for us to trade lower, to explore lower prices."
"2886060","2892020"," Until this is off, we can't even begin to start trading lower because these calls are still open"
"2892020","2893000"," over here."
"2893140","2897400"," If these calls are starting to be closed right now, you might see some weakness in the market. "
"2898060","2902220"," But currently right now we're waiting for a bit of the market to take us higher, right?"
"2902500","2907100"," We're waiting for these calls to expire or be closed for the pin to come off for us to begin"
"2907100","2909840"," to trade lower here and explore these depths."
"2910140","2912040"," Now we know we've got some puts down here, right?"
"2912040","2915620"," And we've got some other puts down below, I think it's like 440 and 430."
"2916320","2921360"," We still need people as we roll over to come down here and start to want to buy lower lows"
"2921360","2927480"," or lower puts for us to, for these bag holders down here, to get their bags filled, right?"
"2927860","2932820"," And then turn you into, that's the whole thing when you're here on social media, like, you know, if"
"2932820","2935500"," you have a bag, right?"
"2936280","2941120"," And I bought down here when it was empty and I filled it up and then Bobby B filled it"
"2941120","2943520"," up and Mikey G filled it up. "
"2943720","2948560"," They have to convince you that there's more room at the top for you to fill."
"2948960","2952460"," And if not enough people believe that there's enough room up here, right?"
"2952740","2955040"," You're the one stuck holding the bag at that point."
"2955600","2956100"," Makes sense. "
"2956420","2960880"," But if enough people believe that they can be filled, you'll find more buyers come in and you'll be"
"2960880","2961780"," able to fill up your bags."
"2961780","2966040"," And then you have to convince the next person that eventually somebody gets help or gets stuck"
"2966040","2966620"," holding the bag."
"2967240","2970880"," I don't know if that makes any sense to any of you out there, not try to simplify things. "
"2971560","2973460"," I don't know if that does simplify things."
"2973580","2974000"," It might not."
"2981660","2982780"," Mute on my mic. "
"2986280","2988120"," So that's my point on the VIX, right?"
"2988260","2989560"," So the VIX is pinned right now."
"2994590","2995950"," Well, that's another good question too."
"2996210","2998230"," So that's another good question too. "
"2998230","3004330"," So some people buy outside the money calls and they don't need to fill their bag."
"3004790","3007150"," So some people say, well, you didn't get a print on that."
"3007210","3008970"," I'm like, yeah, but it went up a hundred percent, right?"
"3009590","3014630"," So some outside the money call buyers can give or hear about the gamma effect on markets. "
"3014970","3016570"," You'll see it sometimes on Tesla."
"3017450","3020290"," You'll see a gamble."
"3020550","3022390"," You'll call your gambling trader. "
"3022650","3027030"," What you're doing is you're coming in and you're trying to fill those bags above you by placing"
"3027030","3030410"," outside the money calls, but you'll see that gamma effect come into the market and leave the"
"3030410","3032090"," market, clean the market and leave the market."
"3032470","3036310"," You'll see like outside the money call buyers will jump in for a swing move, right?"
"3036530","3040370"," While the markets pumping and then they'll close all those calls."
"3040850","3045150"," If they're closing those calls that are outside the money at that moment, you'll see that upward"
"3045150","3046450"," trust, right?"
"3046810","3049390"," Flip right back over and dump down hard and heavy. "
"3049670","3053550"," You notice it with SoftBank has been known to do that in the past as well."
"3053550","3057390"," So there's some other effects and impact outside the money call buying that you see."
"3057490","3063630"," You saw it rampant in 2020 and 2021, but you just don't see it as much as you're used to"
"3063630","3064110"," right now. "
"3065330","3069090"," So we're waiting for the market to make a decision right now as the point that I'm trying to make."
"3069550","3073050"," You've got open calls above by institutions."
"3074090","3077650"," We don't know if they're going to continue to buy calls higher or not. "
"3077810","3082650"," We know that retail didn't get involved in this trade until recently the past three or four days."
"3082650","3084930"," So this is all being pinned by institutions."
"3086550","3090650"," And there are some bigger trades in the market, some strangles in the market, that are pinning it"
"3090650","3093630"," up here to take profit as we head into expiry on Friday. "
"3095670","3096710"," That's my point behind."
"3097210","3098770"," I don't know why everybody's buying puts right now."
"3098830","3102990"," I think it's just dumb retail traders that are listening to too much shit on Twitter. "
"3103530","3106390"," They don't understand the larger mechanics going on in the market right now."
"3108660","3112680"," Unless there's some headline news, let's add some really horrible news or some really great news"
"3112680","3113360"," coming to the market."
"3113360","3116860"," You shouldn't see much movement in the next release today. "
"3117200","3121760"," You might see more movement down tomorrow and then more severe on Friday and then Monday would be"
"3121760","3123300"," the big day if you don't see calls come in."
"3124420","3129060"," Meanwhile, while the market's being pimped up and propped up, you can see some smaller baskets from"
"3129060","3133360"," hedge funds and institutions being pumped for profit over the course of these next few days."
"3137240","3144060"," So it's when people are trying to blame the VIX situation on the VIX problems we had a week or"
"3144060","3146900"," two ago, whatever the fuck it was, it has nothing to do with that. "
"3147540","3148520"," It has nothing to do with it."
"3148600","3151800"," It has to do with the where the calls are in the market, where the puts are in the market,"
"3152320","3154360"," the fact that they're still open right now."
"3154360","3160120"," Watching some calls coming on Sono, S-O-N-O, 1021, 35C, $1.1 million. "
"3160940","3163080"," Calls coming in right now for IWM, right?"
"3163340","3166740"," June 17th, 220C, $2.1 million."
"3167660","3172100"," So if you keep seeing shit like this, you're seeing that the banks aren't done yet with this"
"3172100","3172360"," market."
"3173040","3176800"," IWM, $2.1 million, June 17th, 220C. "
"3177480","3187600"," Calls on UAL, May 20th, 46C, high algo score, DocuSign, DOCU, June 17th, 105P, $1 "
"3187600","3188420",".5 million."
"3189580","3191900"," Some other big calls on DAL."
"3192340","3196580"," We've been seeing DAL all morning long coming up with calls since the beginning. "
"3196760","3198420"," We talked about DAL early this morning."
"3199100","3206780"," More airline prints coming in, not prints, but call options coming in."
"3208900","3212540"," We talked about DAL for DAL, it's 41C for $500,000. "
"3212820","3216820"," JetBlue, May 20th, 14C, $185,000."
"3217320","3218540"," Love with a high algo score."
"3220160","3222320"," You could probably be looking at jets right now. "
"3222480","3226540"," We've got May 20th, 50C, $1.2 million."
"3227760","3232040"," Love with more calls, another $100,000 call on love currently."
"3232340","3236400"," So we're seeing some bid in the airlines across the board. "
"3236400","3238420"," There have been seen airlines all day long, actually."
"3239440","3240700"," And I'm going to show you this real quick."
"3240920","3243820"," Take a quick look at jets. "
"3244920","3247380"," And boy, it looks like it's going to squeeze right now, right?"
"3247920","3252500"," You can see this beautiful little squeeze going on happening as we're talking right now."
"3252980","3256180"," And you can see this nice consolidation phase right here."
"3256820","3257940"," One, boom, dip below. "
"3258080","3261240"," We always love seeing that, right, bam, bam, then a squeeze higher."
"3261900","3264020"," So we'll take a look right now on jets."
"3264880","3267260"," You might be able to get a decent squeeze off of this. "
"3268020","3270620"," You can kind of see this movement down below here."
"3271340","3275040"," We'll take a look at jets and see if that's going to produce anything with all of this call action"
"3275040","3275460"," coming in."
"3278270","3279970"," See if this pans out or not. "
"3281110","3285950"," So two days of sideways movement on jets, lots of call buying on jets."
"3286210","3292710"," Maybe the banks are interested in pumping the airlines."
"3293710","3296050"," Give us a moment to load up here. "
"3310960","3312560"," Let's see if we can get a price target in jets."
"3318880","3325200"," Jets sold off at $22, now trading at $21.73. $22 is where it's sold off prior to."
"3380340","3383120"," See if these buyers are still down here at $458. "
"3384440","3385840"," You can see them still hiding down here."
"3391380","3393220"," And jets still squeezing currently."
"3407640","3409840"," Not much resistance here on jets. "
"3410140","3412200"," Looks like they're fighting for a squeeze right now."
"3413120","3415120"," Slightly more sellers than buyers."
"3416340","3417760"," Keep your eyes on it. "
"3420820","3422520"," Some sellers up here at $22."
"3440720","3443920"," $23.40, $23.50 is an interesting area."
"3470130","3472070"," Whenever it's being shorted right now. "
"3473290","3475230"," Same movement here in DAL."
"3479990","3481770"," Same movement here in Love."
"3482750","3484130"," Call buyers are stepping in. "
"3484290","3486310"," They're seeing the same pattern here."
"3492660","3494820"," Similar in AAL or UAL."
"3498480","3501300"," Same pattern on all the airlines right now. "
"3501860","3502320"," Just keep watching."
"3502320","3505100"," Keep watching lots of airline calls coming in."
"3505940","3506940"," BA as well. "
"3507420","3508660"," That's a big mover of jets."
"3512480","3513840"," They just squeezed higher."
"3516500","3518480"," They just squeezed what?"
"3519500","3520580"," Seven minutes ago. "
"3521480","3522140"," They got a squeeze."
"3522480","3525160"," So it looks like the airlines are looking for a pump real quick."
"3525780","3527760"," Keep your eyes on the airlines and make it a quick squeeze. "
"3528740","3531060"," You might not see it as a parent in jets."
"3531380","3534520"," Sometimes it'll hit the individual airlines."
"3536020","3538420"," And not the not jets. "
"3538720","3540220"," Jets sometimes resistant to squeezing."
"3549570","3550270"," Hey buddy."
"3550490","3550850"," How are you doing?"
"3551330","3551890"," Good. "
"3553570","3554130"," Awesome."
"3561150","3601690"," Still waiting to see if I can get this touchdown below here at $4.58. This"
"3601690","3603150"," is where I'm looking for down here."
"3605630","3610310"," There's been a group of buyers waiting right here at $4.58 on the button. "
"3610630","3614050"," So we'll see if we can trade down here and grab a break."
"3614770","3619590"," Or if we break below and then continue down to S1 over here."
"3620870","3621930"," This is S1 right here. "
"3622090","3627490"," S2, excuse me, down here at $4.55. I don't think we get down to $4.55, but I do"
"3627490","3632390"," think we stay somewhere around $4.58. But if we can get down here into the bell, we'll be happy"
"3632390","3632830"," as well."
"3664970","3665850"," It's not clear."
"3682400","3684040"," This is the buyers I'm looking for here. "
"3684280","3691340"," $4.58. Hey, what's up?"
"3698240","3698960"," Thank you though."
"3714840","3716900"," Keep your eyes down below here."
"3729870","3731590"," Packers masquerading is law enforcement. "
"3731930","3735150"," We're able to get customer data from Meta and Apple."
"3735490","3739070"," This impacts Facebook and Apple."
"3764960","3771060"," Another note would be to look at the ETF called HACK. "
"3771920","3773860"," On that news, it just came out."
"3774900","3777760"," HACK is masquerading as law enforcement."
"3778040","3780900"," We're reportedly able to get customer data from Meta and Apple. "
"3781380","3784960"," Check out Apple, of course, Facebook and then HAC, H-A-C-K."
"3789680","3791840"," Another note, it's top of the R2PM."
"3792040","3793160"," We have market internals update. "
"3794100","3799720"," New York section, NYSE volume at this moment is 389 million shares."
"3801180","3803400"," 5% below its 3 month average."
"3803600","3806940"," Decliners lead advances 1.2 to 1."
"3807380","3810120"," So not really a big rollover at the moment. "
"3810560","3817300"," Nasdaq volume, 3.48 billion shares, 15% above its 3 month average."
"3817560","3821600"," Decliners lead advances slightly higher, 1.4 to 1."
"3822380","3825840"," The VIX index is now plus 2% at 1930."
"3827840","3829860"," And, of course, the related ticker is VIX. "
"3839150","3840310"," A couple other notes."
"3840770","3844550"," President Biden, the U.S., will not be able to sustain COVID testing beyond June without"
"3844550","3845750"," congressional funding."
"3863300","3864140"," This is interesting. "
"3864400","3865460"," This is from earlier this afternoon."
"3865760","3866780"," This is the Fed's George."
"3867640","3868080"," He is a voter. "
"3868920","3869440"," He's a HACK."
"3869460","3872220"," It says it's appropriate to expeditiously raise rates to neutral."
"3873200","3878280"," Balance sheet size needs to decline significantly if inflation is still high at neutral funds rate. "
"3878280","3879960"," More hikes will be needed."
"3880500","3883760"," Pavers a steady and deliberate approach on late rate path."
"3884560","3887880"," Soft landing for the economy is possible but not assured. "
"3888940","3891580"," And he's a HACK and this doesn't sound that HACK-ish."
"3892260","3895800"," A more restrictive policy may need to be needed to cool prices."
"3897140","3900560"," So there is considerable uncertainty surrounding economic and policy outlook. "
"3901200","3905000"," Policy normalization path will likely be a long one."
"3905000","3913480"," That's interesting to read because it's stating that the policy normalization path will likely be a"
"3913480","3914320"," long one."
"3915580","3918840"," The Fed policy will have to be decisive and deliberate. "
"3918960","3925440"," U.S. economy is operating in a strong fashion, puts neutral rate at around 2.5% as a starting"
"3925440","3925840"," point."
"3926720","3932000"," The current inflation surge is different than what the Fed chair vocal face in the 80s."
"3932000","3934900"," Inflation surge is not embedded in the economy. "
"3935580","3937180"," So I think that sounds like transitory."
"3938380","3941240"," That's like another word or another sentence for transitory."
"3941600","3942840"," Mark that one down is new. "
"3943140","3945820"," Inflation surge is not embedded in the economy."
"3946600","3948720"," Asset valuations have been elevated."
"3949740","3952960"," Commercial real estate something she is watching. "
"3956070","3959810"," You know, for how HACK-ish this is, it's not that HACK-ish."
"3960010","3961970"," It seems like they're saying they'll be nimble."
"3961970","3969850"," This kind of fits that narrative of not a hammer. "
"3970270","3976010"," If it's the narrative of we're going to try to massage the economy for another year and a half or"
"3976010","3976510"," two years."
"3977010","3984630"," And if we fuck it up, then welcome to your recession."
"3990270","3992510"," It's HACK-ish but it's not that HACK-ish, right?"
"3992510","3995290"," It's not like the hammer. "
"3998350","4023600"," And she's a hawk, so that was some earlier this afternoon at 12.30. For"
"4023600","4028360"," the Russian center bank thing, you're going to allow stock short selling beginning on March 31st."
"4034500","4035380"," That'll be fun."
"4052510","4055830"," Watching lots of calls on M-U-L-N right now. "
"4056130","4059610"," They blasted off from two bucks to three dollars and one to fifty."
"4060190","4066650"," The puts that are coming in are April 14th 3P for a hundred thousand dollars."
"4068190","4075010"," Just prior to that, there were some calls that came in on M-U-L-N April 14th 2.5C."
"4075590","4079010"," Might be a nice shorting opportunity at some point up here. "
"4079010","4082470"," I don't know what the news is on this trade."
"4083270","4084370"," Why it squeezed higher?"
"4084530","4084970"," It's a nice squeeze."
"4085990","4087790"," Six bucks down to fifty cents. "
"4089710","4091330"," Huge squeeze higher here."
"4101000","4103340"," Let's take a look at it and see if the seller's right where we are."
"4104620","4106300"," M-U-L-N. "
"4109479","4111399"," Looks like it comes back down at some point."
"4114899","4119380"," M-U-L-N automotive."
"4138870","4143149"," The puts being bought to short it back down are April 14th 3P. "
"4147640","4149580"," We'll see if it's the right time to short it or not."
"4151120","4163770"," It could"
"4163770","4164149"," go higher."
"4165069","4167310"," It could go all the way to four dollars, believe it or not. "
"4171600","4174020"," More buyers than sellers right now on M-U-L-N."
"4175479","4176600"," Keep an eye on it."
"4176700","4185620"," If it trades higher to four dollars up here, if it breaks above three twenty, three forty-seven,"
"4185920","4189220"," four dollars might make a nice short once it hits four bucks. "
"4200830","4203250"," Smash and embashing around three ten, three twenty."
"4205350","4207070"," More sellers above a three fifty."
"4208450","4210770"," I think this is the price target to four dollars. "

"4213150","4215730"," If it goes to four bucks, you'll probably show it down and win that trade."
"4219010","4223530"," It's already starting to roll over currently, but it can certainly squeeze higher. "
"4223690","4225130"," You don't want to get caught shorting this."

"4369900","4371620"," I might be able to get to twelve. "
"4371800","4375200"," I think I claimed to twelve to ten but I like to twelve too."
"4385570","4388110"," I'm going to have to adjust my price target."
