"45560","52580"," I like it in the background here trying to figure out what is going on with the new tier, all"
"52580","53180"," patch finishes."
"56780","57860"," Let's get one too. "
"59040","60200"," Let's get a roll in here."
"63280","66960"," Mary Anne Cantalouper, what's up brother?"
"68360","69480"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"71780","76340"," I appreciate that, Perry."
"79520","83440"," Well, no customization. "

"86840","87320"," Save."
"91220","92880"," All right, why is like?"
"93600","94480"," I don't know why. "
"94640","95220"," Good morning."
"95340","96120"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"97500","99820"," We're not looking good this morning, are we?"
"100020","103200"," A little bit of blood this morning."
"103460","105920"," So yesterday's closed. "
"108020","109160"," Like I feel terrible."
"109420","111860"," I promise after the 15th, I'll be back."
"112060","112480"," I promise. "
"113680","116600"," As soon as my kids do, I got a driver for my kids."
"117420","118340"," I'll be here."
"118960","120280"," I got back yesterday. "
"123780","126780"," And so let me really go back to the one minute here."
"127539","130020"," So I got back yesterday from dropping my kids off."
"131880","134340"," And I think I left at two. "
"134760","136220"," Let's find out when I left here."
"137820","140260"," So I left, I think at two, ten."
"140580","143300"," It can be wrong somewhere in there, right?"
"144200","145100"," Well, that's what we got. "
"145340","146840"," Hold on a second here."
"149000","152120"," It was like two, ten in the afternoon, right there."
"152740","153740"," Oh, you guys can't see this. "
"154220","155200"," So this was yesterday."
"156780","158800"," And so I leave yesterday, right?"
"158920","159740"," I'm like, I'm out of here."
"161480","164800"," And I got back at four o'clock and we were right here. "
"167980","169500"," And yesterday's closed, right?"
"169500","172420"," So I made a statement yesterday."
"173400","175140"," Quite clear as day, I think."
"175260","176340"," I think it was clear as day. "
"177060","180300"," And I said, I said, bowls need to."
"180660","181480"," Like, you don't have a choice."
"183240","184420"," So this is yesterday, right?"
"185540","187620"," Bowls needed to yesterday. "
"189240","192600"," Close above the hourly trigger up here."
"192840","195420"," Like, I think I made that crystal clear."
"195980","203200"," Like, you have to close above the hourly trigger and then confirm for showing the buyers here and"
"203200","203940"," then we're going to move higher. "
"204680","209780"," So when I got back yesterday, we were down here and there were still some people in the stream."
"211220","213680"," And people were like, what do you mean you're bearish?"
"213760","215240"," I'm like, oh, I'm bearish in this close."
"215520","216960"," Like, so you've got no. "
"217720","220440"," Here's the idea between yesterday and today is that."
"223180","225280"," The market's being offered up to buyers, right?"
"225600","227100"," Hey, do you have the will to go higher?"
"228020","229140"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"229300","229360"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"229360","229960"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"230160","230520"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"230520","230820"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"231280","231300"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"231300","231420"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"231420","232060"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"232060","232260"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"234640","235800"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"237080","238960"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"246440","248000"," Do you have the will to go higher?"
"250440","260399"," here to make is the path of least resistance is what like the"
"260399","263300"," reason they say that is because you can see right here."
"263500","270020"," It's like an example of path of least resistance is not up right they're telling you screaming at"
"270020","278040"," you yesterday in the fact that you did not close higher means that you do not have buyers stepping"
"278040","284780"," in on the clothes that was required yesterday right so let's look at it on a give me one quick"
"284780","294760"," second here let's look at it um we'll go to trigger screen so let's look at spy"
"294760","301260"," really quick let's pretend that we did have uh just thinking up like a black or something there we"
"301260","306620"," go so pretend you tend you didn't have any of the let me just make this bigger hold on a"
"306620","316000"," second here can I make it bigger here we go so you're coming in here yesterday right you don't know"
"316000","326780"," any of this in here yesterday and you see the hourly trigger yesterday right you"
"326780","335820"," pretend that this is here sorry I have to do this like this but uh and here's the idea is"
"335820","341740"," that you needed the clothes yesterday watch this right is the hourly trigger right here follow my"
"341740","348680"," cursor here you needed the clothes above the hourly trigger into that clothes does that make sense"
"349480","358580"," by a rejection taking place into the clothes yesterday it's point blank telling you no the way is"
"358580","364720"," down so when you when you see this is this inability by bowls to get above the hourly trigger up"
"364720","371480"," here one two three four five and then six into that clothes it's telling you the"
"371480","380960"," way the trigger right"
"380960","387940"," so we're going to look at a few things here now are we done going down it leaves that question"
"387940","395740"," on the table are we done going down here is this a hit and run right we're just confirming the"
"395740","403480"," daily trigger we talk about that right when we talk about I always like two things so when we come"
"403480","412420"," when we squeeze over the daily trigger like this when we squeeze"
"412420","418500"," over this daily trigger like this you're always looking for not just the confirmation the hourly"
"418500","429320"," but the daily trigger as well now can the markets bounce off this daily trigger and"
"429320","437580"," go higher yes it can but there's a bigger warning here and I want to show you the bigger warning"
"437580","445860"," here the there's a real danger here and where we go right is it actually more like this underneath"
"445860","451280"," and then down right and not that consolidation bounce up so we're going to take"
"451280","461140"," a look at a right"
"461140","468200"," now number one I want to express something clearly to we break over the daily trigger you are"
"468200","475660"," looking for a successful retest of that daily trigger pay attention to that okay successful retest"
"475660","483220"," we've talked about this ad nauseam so just if you're a bull right now where can you take a long"
"483220","491600"," you can't take it here can you you need to watch price get above the hourly trigger from this point"
"491600","498620"," forward so watch this hourly trigger right here you need to see buyers step in get above the hourly"
"498620","505760"," consolidate begin to move up that's where you can actually take a long now saying all this for the"
"505760","512539"," bulls there's something else you need to be looking at and that is going to be well let me see"
"512539","518880"," I go to main screen here or we buy we will full chart screen here the real problem here for"
"518880","526740"," bulls right is if you go to an hourly chart we showed this yesterday right showed an hourly trend"
"526740","535460"," rolling over here right watching that trend rolling over here you slam down on the daily trigger"
"535460","542200"," pay attention to this right and then you come back up here and you read start rejecting to the"
"542200","548700"," downside or you begin rejecting to the downside and here at any point it's not going to be pretty"
"548700","556000"," is it it's going to it's going to end nasty does that happen today probably not it'll likely happen"
"556000","564740"," into tomorrow you see the down move right there and the place to sell the market is somewhere up at"
"564740","574340"," 448 59 right up in here 448 59 to sell that market for continued downside right right up here 448"
"574340","580780"," 58 448 is the next sell signal they're going to try to squeeze this up they're going to sell back"
"580780","587020"," down into tomorrow and likely try to target with that 440 that we keep talking about down here"
"587020","594900"," right so we're going to talk about the implications here because these downside moves usually last"
"594900","602180"," multiple days one well we got I guess out of this one but you can certainly count that one right"
"602180","609060"," there at a minimum three days of downside moving that's into Friday right cap wants to buy a dip"
"609060","617380"," come down here and at minimum you're going to get that now if this rejects even further it turns"
"617380","625200"," into a four hour you're talking about eight to nine days of down sessions of down so are we done"
"625200","632160"," here right now are we bullish the answer is no we're not bullish now the answer is you're looking"
"632160","640440"," for right here some kind of a rejection you watch this right here and even this yellow line right"
"640440","645440"," here could reject this down even further right so you got kind of have three places here to be"
"645440","650540"," watching now the first one you're going to be watching for is right here see this cell cell trigger"
"650540","654900"," I've got right here watch that right there that little cell trigger I've got right there and you"
"654900","664750"," got another one up here we'll move the gray love bar down here and look for more selling to the"
"664750","670190"," downside do I think we're over here no and where do you have a where do you have a dip"
"670190","679170"," buy here if you are a bull is only if that only if price gets above the hourly trigger right"
"679170","684770"," and you start to make your way higher that's a multi-day process like this is a multi-day process"
"684770","689950"," even begin to want to take a dip here and start to take it higher as a bull as of"
"689950","696250"," right now sellers are in control just a matter of selling this back down one more dip to the"
"696250","702510"," downside squeezing this back up and then continue downside over here does that make any sense to"
"702510","709650"," you so right we are right now right we are right now in this market you could have a can"
"709650","715210"," have like a you can have like a yeah i'm gonna buy this dip or something like that but it's"
"715210","724070"," likely going to sell from above up here you're likely going to get continued downside action just"
"724070","729510"," like just like that down there and get down to that price target that daily trigger we're likely"
"729510","734810"," going to touch it we're pretty close to it right pretty close touching it right here I don't know"
"734810","740030"," so yesterday at the close the people that were here in the close with me yesterday I was like I"
"740030","745190"," tried to slam the buy button on puts into the bell and I was two minutes late I'm like why"
"745190","752250"," is this going through and so hopefully if you were able to go short or buy some puts or s "
"752250","759090","-dow well now for the for the bears we have another issue here we're going to address right now so"
"759090","764930"," we're going to talk about s-dow after the close yesterday I talked to Joe donut on the phone and"
"764930","770510"," I was like have you looked at s-dow he goes no and here so I was looking for I"
"770510","780510"," was looking for puts for spy in April spy puts for April yesterday and I'm like"
"780510","785690"," hey there's no April contract there's like a June contract and a March contract I really want that"
"785690","792010"," April contract for spy specifically he's like is there anything else we can do so I said yeah I was"
"792010","800610"," like let's look at s-dow so we looked at s-dow yesterday after the close and it looks great"
"800610","810050"," this morning by the way but let's look at it right here so s-dow hold on a second here"
"812410","819870"," yeah look at it right just like this so just looking at s-dow down here right had a beautiful"
"819870","828530"," bounce down below one two three it's a little bit higher one two three and then we come back down"
"828530","834050"," here and just touch this byline so just watch this right here it's kind of like a guaranteed thing"
"834050","839430"," right it's going to rip it's going to rip it's going to rip it's going to rip and right now"
"839430","846030"," what is it waiting for right it's got the it's got the dip bounce already on the hourly then the"
"846030","853470"," daily excuse me and it looks like it wants to rip higher right if we start to rip higher to"
"853470","862270"," this 20 26 and change 20 25 90 something like that what does that spell for the marketplace"
"862270","869370"," so if you're looking at spy right now then you're on a one minute chart here and you're like hey"
"869370","875150"," is are we done going down here the answer is likely not right if if s-dow is going to"
"875150","885090"," continue higher we're likely going to see more continuation to the downside I want you to"
"885090","894470"," see it here right right over there do we at least at a minimum of more continuation"
"894470","903470"," to the downside well that print 26 or 25 90 25 80 I don't know I think that it will"
"903470","910630"," print that 25 26 90 somewhere down in here so if you're a bull and you're like hey look cap"
"910630","917130"," we're looking for like number one cap i'm looking for a dip to buy uh how do I know when"
"917130","922310"," I can buy a dip you already know that unless you get over that hourly trigger you got no dip"
"922310","927950"," right and got no dip unless you get over this and start turning it around right unless you start"
"927950","935630"," turning this around you've got no dip if anything you're on cell mode and the way that s-dow looks"
"935630","942570"," it looks like you're going to get a bloodbath coming up from that from that s-dow right not we're"
"942570","949350"," not done here are we s-dow doesn't look like we're done down here does it so more downside likely"
"949350","959110"," to come more more downside likely to come the worst part of this is it puts into question the"
"959110","965370"," bull thesis so if you begin to have a failure to make new highs if we end up getting that"
"965370","971110"," that failure right we come all the way back down here do you actually have the time to have that"
"971110","978610"," kick ass uh September that not not September bear but kick ass September and uh and can you get to"
"978610","985970"," 47 20 can you get to 480 by end of year and the answer is likely no the answer is"
"985970","993670"," if we trade down here the answer is likely no you start you're gonna trade 440 you're looking to"
"993670","1001270"," start trading 420 into the end of the quarter you've got no time left in September it's now um"
"1001270","1009830"," September 6th so that 420 becomes a huge magnet to the downside a huge magnet to the downside at"
"1009830","1017970"," the end of a quarter so pay attention to this as it unwinds i think the failure yesterday i was"
"1017970","1023130"," talking to Joe on the phone last night and i was like i think the quarterly failure was right here"
"1023130","1030609"," right here yesterday that was your quarterly failure this tells you the way is down and it is"
"1030609","1038390"," likely not over so i'm going to start to get pretty bearish on the market in general for the rest"
"1038390","1044109"," of the year even if we have up like we have a good Christmas rally something like that likely at"
"1044109","1051610"," this point unless something turns around right uh we're going to change our stance to being pretty"
"1051610","1060510"," bearish uh into end of year and into the springtime uh pretty bearish here so i think three forty"
"1060510","1068410"," five yesterday that was your signal bull run over going down and we likely are not done going down"
"1068410","1076210"," and we're likely going to continue to the downside into friday uh 440 price target by friday right"
"1076210","1081850"," now even with a real relief rally or whatever involved in that so good morning how are you all"
"1081850","1088680"," doing yeah i missed it by two minutes i'm over here like yesterday blab and blah blah blah blah"
"1088680","1093360"," blah blah blah i went to go slam the button and it was 417 in the afternoon i was pretty"
"1093360","1102100"," upset and i was trying to buy monday 440s they were 20 fucking three cents yesterday at the closing"
"1102100","1111580"," bell 23 cents uh i don't know what they're trading right now but i'm pretty upset enough for 20 440"
"1111580","1123080"," p's were 23 cents for monday at the close 440 p was the way to go oh this is"
"1123080","1130600"," this i don't think this will become orderly uh so this will not be i don't think this so we"
"1130600","1138300"," we're not there yet so i don't want to make these proclamations but we are at a point where uh"
"1138300","1148080"," it will not be orderly once you remove the thesis for bulls for the year uh bulls will wrap it"
"1148080","1155860"," up and be gone they will disappear from the marketplace so i don't think this ends orderly uh"
"1155860","1161800"," certain issue that yesterday at 345 you can see there was no will to buy there and i am assuming"
"1161800","1171640"," i'm assuming that bulls are saying to themselves um we have this down here right assuming that"
"1171640","1178100"," bulls are thinking let me go to a full chart assuming that bulls are thinking yeah we bought this"
"1178100","1186020"," you bought this i'm gonna come right back down over here we're gonna buy this and i think there's a"
"1186020","1193220"," larger bear trap here i think that there is a larger bear trap here and end of end of quarter"
"1193220","1201240"," and i think what this does is i think this shows there's no time left for the bull thesis so"
"1201240","1210860"," the orderly manner of selling has a high probability to become uh wrap it up for the year like no"
"1210860","1216140"," more money in the stock market and move it up move it somewhere else and uh begin to take not"
"1216140","1221680"," just profit but try to put money to to work somewhere else uh i hope you guys understand this"
"1221680","1228260"," thesis but money moves around the market and moves out of the market moves to other places when you"
"1228260","1234680"," see things like this it immediately triggers i'm not talking about you with a thousand dollar"
"1234680","1241000"," account i'm talking about normal people with money in the market they know from today they're going"
"1241000","1247020"," to know that whatever upside potential there is there this year they come back in the spring for it"
"1247020","1252800"," you don't come back now they come back in like february and april for it so uh this should trigger"
"1252800","1260800"," some kind of major this should trigger some kind of major like sentiment change no matter what"
"1260800","1268240"," people are told between now and um now and end of month or something like that they're like the"
"1268240","1273660"," bull to make to me the bull thesis is pretty much totes it's like it's like it's really a five"
"1273660","1279400"," percent chance of being legit uh so when bears are at that five percent or fifteen percent i tell"
"1279400","1284760"," them as well uh i don't mind telling them i'm going to tell you right now is a bull that"
"1284760","1292200"," your thesis is likely done uh i can't can't call it yet but pretty close to calling it my"
"1292200","1300520"," assumption here is going to be you're going to be able to call the bull run over uh when you"
"1300520","1305800"," you're going to tag this down here right and you're going to get that further failure we're at that"
"1305800","1312220"," further failure point if that happens the bull run is likely over i'll call the bull run over at"
"1312220","1321880"," that point uh for um for what for until april of 2024 that's a long time right where are we"
"1321880","1330460"," at right now um September 6th so i'll call the bull run dead uh as soon as as soon as"
"1330460","1336060"," we get out here and the bulls get trapped to the downside to 420 bull run will be done until"
"1336060","1344060"," april 2024 pretty big pretty big statement right i don't i think that's a big statement you know"
"1344060","1348620"," hold on one second here you go back to the one minute so you can see it going down there"
"1348620","1357300"," just to touch that daily trigger this is my price target right here that's the bottom by the way"
"1357300","1366360"," just if you don't know that's the bottom for right now it's gonna it's gonna bounce here right"
"1366360","1374640"," around here it's gonna bounce and then uh it's gonna go further down we ain't done here we ain't"
"1374640","1391500"," done over here excuse me but it sells the same place right there whoo"
"1391500","1399020"," 445 93 baby just give me like the 88 i will actually want 445 86 is what i want and"

"2089639","2097560"," on we got here and we're rather biode already it's that question what do you think about the"
"2097560","2106540"," concept revisions and the job data um what do i think about the constant revisions to jobs data uh"
"2106540","2114200"," you know it's more about like i think there's a front running that comes into this and it matters"
"2114200","2119840"," when it starts right but when does it start um the jobs data is going to only get worse over"
"2119840","2125580"," time we know that for sure like regardless of what you think about jobs it's going to get worse uh"
"2125580","2131240"," it's just a matter of the time frame that it gets worse and also the front running of that jobs"
"2131240","2136560"," data like the top you have two months three months um you know it's we were i was talking to"
"2136560","2140400"," joe yesterday and i was like you know i was like they're it's like all these bulls always talk"
"2140400","2149340"," about um uh qe being good and i'm always like they don't i was like did they not realize that"
"2149340","2158160"," the moment we kick into qe we're usually uh at a bottom of some kind like the last bottom it's"
"2158160","2162800"," not like we're trading up this was like a weekly chart or something it's not like we're up here and"
"2162800","2169180"," you get qe right it's usually down here that the qe actually kicks in right that trough check down"
"2169180","2174040"," there so i was like i'm always like flabbergasted and shocked and people say that so just even what"
"2174040","2180380"," i'm doing right here if this was a one if this was a weekly chart right um in let's say"
"2180380","2187720"," they're anticipating qe here right and they're anticipating a pausing being told there's a pausing"
"2187720","2196660"," of rates somewhere right here it usually gets front run to the downside before that qe kicks in so"
"2196660","2200940"," the idea here is that when you you have time this right they're trying to time this to happen"
"2200940","2210480"," you're like like time like if the time that that last roll down for when that qe is coming"
"2210480","2217580"," when that pause is no longer believed with higher rates right they will front run it uh do i think"
"2217580","2222760"," that jobs numbers deteriorate over that time period yeah they do uh just a matter of timing it"
"2222760","2228220"," other than that um i don't think jobs numbers gets better and they're not going to pat him at some"
"2228220","2238150"," point you know what i'm saying so i don't know if that makes sense to or not like"
"2238150","2243250"," if this was a if this was a weekly chart here right you're driving up driving up driving up and"
"2243250","2250430"," then when that that pause is beginning like pause is beginning to be I missed a you in there didn't"
"2250430","2258970"," I we'll call that a you that's an s you know the pause will be anticipated and then once they're"
"2258970","2264970"," like yeah that these guys are going to start cutting rates they already begin to to drop it then"
"2264970","2269390"," you get oh yeah we're right we're cutting rates and we're going to slam into qe right there right"
"2269390","2274910"," and so all of a sudden we're we're buying that bounce down this is a big bigger trough thing i"
"2274910","2280170"," don't know if you guys know about the stuff but there's like a i drew that wrong we'll bring up"
"2280170","2286770"," uh we'll bring up um we'll bring up distribution i used to bring up distribution more frequently"
"2286770","2293150"," but i don't anymore but usually you have this whole thing where uh you have the initial roll down"
"2293150","2298730"," you make your way back up normally get a new high right there when you come back down to the"
"2298730","2305290"," trough and you check this previous low and then you take off from there to the upside so where it"
"2305290","2310110"," looks like we're right there right now looks like we're right there and uh so they're going to try"
"2310110","2314250"," to make this happen early and that's what it looks like to me at least they're going to try to"
"2314250","2324480"," make this happen early let"
"2326050","2337410"," me see what you guys got here always"
"2337410","2344390"," they always front run that 100% every single time they front run it there's a few instances where"
"2344390","2351810"," they have gotten it too early in a few instances of slightly late but always they they've front run"
"2351810","2359830"," it every single time now then you'll see unemployment come up and you'll see um rate pausing and"
"2359830","2366730"," you'll see inflation bottoming that's the other part of this when inflation begins to bottom that"
"2366730","2377870"," same that same effect happens every time let me"
"2377870","2384910"," see what you guys are saying here Norman Glassman what's going on brother thanks for the support"

"2430550","2434330"," them because i'm like these fucking guys are going to try to tell these people that they're not"
"2434330","2441990"," going to cut and uh they have to hold like hold the facade as long as possible um hold of"
"2441990","2445290"," a side i mean there's might be like two or three more rate cuts the moment they're over the rate"
"2445290","2450350"," of inflation rate cuts are done right you're gonna get over the rate of inflation bring it back"
"2450350","2460120"," down to two percent yeah i don't listen to maverick i find him"

"2546800","2553080"," tesla parked right now came up slammed into its uh 259-50 came up slammed into it again yesterday"
"2553080","2560320"," and it's now parked let's uh delete all this so you can get it nice and clean here tesla's sitting"
"2560320","2567380"," on its daily trigger right now this is kind of the place right we talk about the book being written"
"2567380","2575140"," for the stock market at large you can already see here that was parked on the daily trigger for"
"2575140","2582620"," tesla right parked right here in daily trigger and uh the idea here is that bulls have to hold this"
"2582620","2589120"," right we said we're in chapter eight of the stock market we know that tesla's already tested its"
"2589120","2595460"," daily trigger and held we're coming back now one more time to break through it uh if this begins to"
"2595460","2602440"," break down i want you to pay attention to this if tesla at any point begins to break below right"
"2602440","2610660"," where we are right now right like this 246 245 if this does not get bought if the buyers have"
"2610660","2618540"," left the market if panic is created right we start to trade below and they give all this move up"
"2618540","2624700"," down here uh the price target to the downside is going to be quite vicious right it's not going to"
"2624700","2631780"," be pretty you're going to wind up looking for a new low not this low you're going to wind up"
"2631780","2641720"," looking for uh a new low down here that's we're saying click this in here so you've got 21250"
"2641720","2649600"," and to be honest with you you're like you're not going to want to hear this ready you're likely"
"2649600","2661820"," going to be looking for 96 60 believe it or not uh i think that gap if i recall don't"
"2661820","2669580"," hold me to this but i think it's 96 60 down here you have to check it i think that's"
"2669580","2679490"," where the prior gap is down below i'm going to show this to you right now i think don't"
"2679490","2685210"," don't hold me to this i have to check because i'm recalling information from a couple years ago"
"2688940","2696020"," prior gap never filled they never filled this the morning that of the low they never filled that"
"2696020","2706340"," prior gap hold on one second here thank you so"
"2706340","2713800"," you will expect that to happen how does that happen and we're going to show it to you right now"
"2716600","2726510"," 30 minute chart right now i'm going to show you like both ways this happens try try to"
"2726510","2735130"," do it like prey on drawings here you're going to get underneath the daily trigger here your first"
"2735130","2741670"," target is going to be 229 20 possibly even the monthly trigger down here 226 somewhere down in"
"2741670","2751550"," there you're likely going to get a squeeze up consolidation here a major break below let me"
"2751550","2760450"," just um a major break below right here and your target would be 2252 the downside right there"
"2760450","2769990"," something just like that just like that i don't know what's going on here i don't know what is"
"2769990","2781020"," going on here but i'm on the filler i'm on the filler here something"
"2781020","2787180"," just like this right here you see it to the downside watch that watch that daily trigger come down"
"2787180","2793080"," get price underneath the daily and the hourly and start making our way to the downside you'll get a"
"2793080","2799200"," tag here and then the final blast through you get the new low on the monthly turnish bearish we'll"
"2799200","2805180"," actually go back up here and this would be the powerful one so the powerful move here too would be"
"2805180","2816950"," the powerful of the downside would be a four trigger cluster right in here and this"
"2816950","2822110"," is actually where the ass blastin takes place you have plenty of time here too don't think like you"
"2822110","2830570"," don't have plenty of time for this move but this is where the powerful downside move would come"
"2830570","2837370"," you'd get like a breath of fresh air come up into that monthly back down to that below that monthly"
"2837370","2844470"," and weekly and we're like we're like on like donkey kung like blast through blast through and then"
"2844470","2850490"," believe it or not some pretty violent moves this is likely into February at some point we'll be a"
"2850490","2855690"," little bit a little bit moving over there oh that's september so forget i'm drawing this right now"
"2855690","2859470"," this should be on a september time frame i don't think it's that fast like it's not end of"
"2859470","2865330"," september we're down at uh ninety six dollars or anything to be spread out into um into september a"
"2865330","2870710"," lot of consolidation but dude this move right here i want to tell you some if you're a bull tell"
"2870710","2879010"," you some right now if we reject 225 it is on for bulls on so if you're testable uh 220"
"2879010","2888310"," anything below 225 rejecting is super bearish like super super bearish what you bulls need to do"
"2888310","2894910"," here maybe the separate side of this so we have a second bounce on tassel on the daily trigger so"
"2894910","2902550"," this is your bearish cathesis into uh February and april not september February and april bullish"
"2902550","2911710"," thesis here would be that we confirm again the daily trigger right and you're going to be looking"
"2911710","2921610"," for price to break above uh today as an example"
"2921610","2931700"," or tomorrow 250 so if you can get above 250 you are right back on track right here i'm going"
"2931700","2940720"," to make this right i'll make this one green i'll make that one red you ain't got no time bulls"
"2940720","2950600"," you're you're in chapter nine you need to regain 250 you need to hold on a second but you"
"2950600","2959740"," need to break above consolidate back down 250 and show the way is higher you actually take that out"
"2959740","2969600"," right there and then start to make your way higher right there main screen so there's"
"2969600","2977900"," tassel for you i'm still in spy calls i'm in spy calls here i don't i don't need um i"
"2977900","2984560"," don't i get spy calls they're there until end of day they're until end of end of the day or"
"2984560","2990260"," until we trade i shouldn't say it till we trade up here spy calls are on and no puts for"
"2990260","2996700"," me either until we get back up there to sell that so we'll be puts up here or estal calls"
"2996700","3001320"," up there but uh no no puts from here i know how this goes i want nothing to do it"
"3001320","3008320"," i'm not bag-holding for putt holders like don't not don't ever offer me that they're don't ever"
"3008320","3018120"," offer for me to be a put put bag holder well is there a fundamental reason no they don't need"
"3018120","3026540"," to be filled there's i have some bias with um i have some bias if i if i if i"
"3026540","3034540"," see a lot of gaps being filled uh to the downside or the upside let me give it a better"
"3034540","3041120"," better way to look at gaps these are my rules for gaps gaps can be left behind on the up"
"3041120","3047840"," or downside we can leave them there for years believe it or not uh we always come back to fill"
"3047840","3053880"," those gaps let me see and write this out for you one quick second you can do a snapshot of"
"3053880","3063750"," this captain's rules on gaps fill as they get here okay so captain's rules"
"3063750","3073350"," on gaps gaps do not need to be filled do not need to be filled immediately"
"3076870","3082130"," i don't know if i spelled that right but gaps do not need to be filled immediately that's up or"
"3082130","3092170"," down doesn't matter up or down uh i do have a bias i do have"
"3092170","3101340"," a bias if we begin to fill gaps uh up or down"
"3101340","3110300"," doesn't matter that usually implies a larger move so let's say we leave behind a bunch of gaps oh"
"3110300","3115600"," my god we're back there does that make sense so if we leave behind a bunch of gaps i'm like"
"3115600","3122380"," yeah this isn't permanent we're coming back to close those gaps eventually does that make sense now"
"3122380","3128820"," if we begin to close gaps up or down i i get a bias that we're going to go in"
"3128820","3135660"," that direction until we close all those gaps or the majority of those gaps does that make sense so"
"3135660","3141340"," i do have a bias we begin to fill gaps up or down so yeah i will say if we"
"3141340","3144500"," start tagging upside targets on gaps i'm like yeah we're going to go up there and clean all those"
"3144500","3149200"," out same thing to the downside we have gaps down below and we start to clean them out let's see"
"3149200","3156060"," how we're going to get down there and clean most of those gaps up or or out so another thing"
"3156060","3166330"," on gaps is this i'm more i am more i lean more towards gaps i lean more towards closing"
"3166330","3177880"," gaps on smaller time frames so if"
"3177880","3182880"," i see a gap on a one-minute chart five minute chart something like that i'm like yeah let's even"
"3182880","3190640"," clean those up and i use them as pivots now if you see a giant gap on like a daily"
"3190640","3196740"," chart or a weekly chart now that fucking gap can stay there for like six months nine months one"
"3196740","3202100"," year there's no like time frame it's not like yeah we get this giant gap down the daily we're going"
"3202100","3207120"," down there to take it out you could be waiting like nine months six months a year and a half"
"3207120","3214260"," to actually fill that gap that you want to fill there you go there's uh you want to screenshot that"
"3214260","3221080"," you can but there's no hard there's no hard and fast rule on gaps for me at least or not"
"3221080","3230140"," on not on higher time frames yeah that's like if you look at a daily chart or weekly chart they're"
"3230140","3237700"," fucking gaps that are littered uh for years like the smaller time frames much easier to close a gap"
"3237700","3247560"," does that does that help you guys or no hold on one second here i gotta take quick"
"3247560","3265130"," phone call hold on one second here weird i"
"3265130","3275440"," got like uh i got like a phone call like nobody there just some rando yeah you"
"3275440","3280640"," guys do you guys have anything to add to that maybe maybe you've got your own gap rules that don't"
"3280640","3285580"," align with those gap rules you have something that like disagrees with that that maybe i can learn"
"3285580","3292240"," from or something maybe i miss something on gaps but that's pretty much what i got on it that was"
"3292240","3321550"," you that called i didn't hear a voice it was just like quiet breathing yeah"
"3321550","3332730"," on a daily chart like i agree with you bear town sheriff 100 agree with you yeah"
"3332730","3337230"," i'm long here i'm not i can't if you're short here let me know i think you're out of your"
"3337230","3342210"," mind if you're short here i think you're i think you're straight out of your mind so i think you're"
"3342210","3347290"," crazy i think if you said i'm getting short up here i would i would agree with you on that"
"3347290","3354230"," statement uh but there's no right now puts are being sold to you i promise you 100 guaranteed"
"3354230","3360210"," profit taking so yesterday in the close i saw where everybody was short so they've they've all"
"3360210","3367630"," closed they're all gone they're they're out of those like the estal uh downside is done they're"
"3367630","3372250"," gone now it's actually a really good taker to watch because people jump on it and then they jump"
"3372250","3380130"," out the fall or when it happens they jump out let's keep your eyes on estal fuck yeah you take"
"3380130","3388610"," money and run dude period like run 100% of the time every time 100% of the time every"
"3388610","3394010"," time you're out of your fucking mind if you're short down here uh you can be just not here like"
"3394010","3398730"," take the money and run reposition and then we'll continue to go down that's like uh that's like a"
"3398730","3404530"," bull getting up to the daily trigger and being long you take the money and you run and you look"
"3404530","3413710"," for a bounce to buy right uh don't they eventually become void not that i know of i've always seen"
"3413710","3419750"," us go back and close those gaps from my experience we always go back to closing i've never seen one"
"3419750","3426810"," eventually left behind they always come back uh but what's your time frame like if you leave a"
"3426810","3432370"," daily if you leave a daily gap on spy are you short for a year and a half to close"
"3432370","3436510"," that gap that's insane you're not you're not carrying that you're not paying the fees for that"
"3436510","3442930"," you're not you're not michael barry sorry you might claim to be not you i mean like people claim"
"3442930","3450890"," that shit i'm like you're there's no fucking way that guy's doing that not not happening uh now"
"3450890","3457330"," i've never seen him become void cheever never once uh i've seen him i've seen him left behind from"
"3457330","3462170"," there a fact the tesla gap at 96 dollars how do i know that gap like i know it's down"
"3462170","3466750"," there i know it's never been closed matter fact that gap on tesla let's find it right now let's go"
"3466750","3472350"," look at it give me a second here let's go find that tesla gap that i was talking about find"
"3472350","3479030"," out exactly where it is uh that fucking thing i know it's there i know it's still there you know"
"3479030","3488030"," what the fuck is that tsla let's go look at tesla let's see if it's gone so we can"
"3488030","3496550"," find it we can find it on this chart yeah i don't know maybe you're right cheever i don't see"
"3496550","3501810"," it here it's not showing it down here but there's a gap down here at 96 go back and look"
"3501810","3511090"," at it they claim and they filled that gap let's go over there and see if it's still there no"
"3511090","3519310"," no they haven't closed it there's a little bit right there it's a little bit of a gap you see"
"3519310","3529270"," it and they're not even showing it to you whoop it's right here it's actually from"
"3529270","3538730"," there i guess you could say it's right there there's that bad boy right down there 93 11 95"
"3538730","3548710"," 70 so i guess we cleaned it up it's right down here don't let us take it here right"
"3548710","3558510"," down there there's an 80 bitty gap hiding down there never filled gap left behind"
"3565990","3575830"," on my boy tesla i didn't forget about that gap i didn't maybe you guys forgot about it but i"
"3575830","3583330"," didn't forget about it it's way down there just imagine if we clean that gap up right there tesla"
"3583330","3604660"," bears would be stoked tesla bears like i didn't forget that gap cap oh"
"3604660","3613620"," yeah baby keep on going up keep on going got darth helmet darth helmet's over there with puts right"
"3613620","3622160"," now just getting all his money's burning off right now he's like god damn it god damn it god damn"
"3622160","3632020"," it that's how you catch a band before it even happens don't know your levels get out of here"
"3632020","3644760"," go away well what else is saying uh no way tesla will go to 95 i'm"
"3644760","3654720"," in a disagreement with that but i think you see tesla at 95ish um april february april i"
"3654720","3659300"," think you see it i mean i think you see it one way or another i think even if we"
"3659300","3667920"," hit 480 you'd see 95 if spy even hit 480 i think 95 is still on top for tesla one"
"3667920","3672560"," way it doesn't matter doesn't matter if this is the top or not doesn't matter if we hit 480 95"
"3672560","3680300"," is on top for tesla i think i i think i've told you guys what that is how that happens"
"3680300","3685600"," i can tell you again if you want i've told you some of you guys know more than you're supposed"
"3685600","3693460"," to um some of you guys are here every day no more than you're supposed to so uh tesla should"
"3693460","3703280"," like should stay good for for the site like we priced in the cybertrack release uh"
"3703280","3710140"," price in some kind of uh like level five fsd that's exclusive to the cybertrack that nobody wants"
"3710140","3719060"," to say yes to that um but then once that stuff comes out um i think you're going to see"
"3719060","3724140"," like hey it's been priced in but then you're going to see two things that are going to be very"
"3724140","3731880"," negative now the first thing is i think people are going to be shocked at the delivery of the"
"3731880","3741830"," cybertrack for the normies how long the delivery schedule is like how"
"3741830","3746410"," long it takes for you to for you the normal person to get your cybertrack is going to be a"
"3746410","3753890"," shock and then the promises of that uh level four level five stuff is going to be like no fuck"
"3753890","3760330"," no it's not level five so uh i think that's going to be the negative news that you're looking for"
"3760330","3764730"," those two those two things you're going to hear that you're going to hear that at some point next"
"3764730","3774240"," year um maybe after 10 for one split i'm a tesla bull man"
"3774240","3781100"," don't don't like uh think i'm not a tesla bull here i'm as close to tesla as you can be"
"3781100","3788580"," without actually working for them uh the things a lot of things that i know are from actual uh"
"3788580","3795300"," people that know so i don't know my take don't believe my take you don't have i don't you don't"
"3795300","3801140"," have to but i'm a tesla bull dude i'm just not i'm tesla gang too but i'm not i'm like"
"3801140","3808520"," more of a realist on tesla so if you're a tesla bull i would say that's two if you're a"
"3808520","3813240"," tesla bull right uh you probably want to buy 95 dollars 95"
"3813240","3823650"," you know you feel"
"3823650","3827190"," like a long-term tesla bull you don't care about 95 if anything you're like fuck yeah bring it back"
"3827190","3831310"," i'll buy it that's i believe that to me that's a real tesla bull if you can bring it back"
"3831310","3836690"," to 95 dollars they can buy again let's do it so that's what i think that gappy and left behind"
"3836690","3841650"," is a problem for me so i think that all needs cleaned up um so i think 95 is on"
"3841650","3848990"," the table i don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask you that that's a weird thing too so when"
"3848990","3853990"," we were at a hundred bucks no one wanted to long tesla there like i was like the only person"
"3853990","3859290"," and i missed that i missed the buy i was i did it on stream i was so angry like"
"3859290","3865710"," the morning of that low on tesla that morning i sat there to buy 96 dollars i was like i'm"
"3865710","3873670"," gonna buy 96 and those fuckers left me behind i'm salty about it i bought tesla after at like a"
"3873670","3881700"," hundred and fifteen or something and i was pissed off that i later i was angry i was like full "
"3881700","3888920","-on angry uh that we didn't hit that 96 and there weren't many people buying that down there there"
"3888920","3894600"," were not that what i recall was uh i was told don't buy that like don't buy that 96 dollars"
"3894600","3899040"," matter of fact uh we had risk at that time to go down if we reject if we had broken"
"3899040","3907300"," through 96 95 93 does anybody remember what the target was below that it was 65 dollars somewhere"
"3907300","3912680"," in there right 63 65 or something like that i'm remembering this off top my head if you don't think"
"3912680","3918240"," i'm a tesla bull i know all these numbers like i'll throw all that shit out to you this is"
"3918240","3922160"," where i have taught my like i'm not even researching anything i already know that that next number"
"3922160","3928980"," was 65 so um you know and there are people there saying we're going straight 65 and we had risk"
"3928980","3935740"," of going to 65 at that moment uh and there was like probably like half the people were like 65s"
"3935740","3942800"," on top but matter of fact i'll say one more thing on this topic so i'm in that tesla group"
"3942800","3948340"," some of you guys are in you guys know that you know that tesla that tesla gang uh private chat"
"3948340","3952840"," you guys have i mean i think i am maybe i've been booted since then but i'm in that tesla"
"3952840","3959880"," gang that super private chat you guys have i'm a member of that and i remember back then posting"
"3959880","3966860"," and uh there were a lot of big time bulls that wanted that 65 bucks too like tesla gang was"
"3966860","3978930"," like i want that 65 and i don't believe that hundred i remember that uh"
"3978930","3983370"," say this again now uh quick question EMAs and notice that you set your charts to include after"
"3983370","3990790"," hours which can really impact where EMAs land um is my MA strategy only about after pricing factor"
"3990790","3997570"," in EMAs no what i tend to do is trade um futures on their own EMAs and then cash market"
"3997570","4005530"," in their own EMAs so like so if i'm trading a good question so i'm trading cash market tickers uh"
"4005530","4011950"," they stand on their own without after hours and then if you're gonna like switch to es i use the"
"4011950","4020010"," ea i use es as the um uh to trade the emas but i do not trade emas during the"
"4020010","4027690"," daytime hours on futures uh i trade them on a cash market and spx has a tendency to have an"
"4027690","4036850"," even more accurate read if you're trading it's really weird uh emas on indexes are not as clean as"
"4036850","4040550"," they are on individual tickers if you didn't know that i'm going to let you know that individual"
"4040550","4052030"," tickers they tend to be better good question gorilla yeah i"
"4052030","4061830"," tend to find um uh the tendencies that i see are uh the most accurate uh most accurate"
"4061830","4070210"," is individual single tickers the most inaccurate for accuracy sake is indexes and then i jump"
"4070210","4078660"," between them depending on what i'm trading uh well no so"
"4078660","4088100"," uh think of it like this uh krillow uh look at spx right and"
"4088100","4095600"," they don't have um after hours action right so you've got like a very clean chart like the"
"4095600","4102439"," sloppiness and pre-market and after hours usually resolves itself um if you if you use that as an"
"4102439","4110460"," example i guess as to um the like so tickers individual tickers after hours works with the uh after"
"4110460","4116899"," hours works with the uh triggers as well on individual tickers the only sloppiness that i find is"
"4116899","4125479"," um the only sloppiness that i find is inside of um uh what inside the indexes it's the only only"
"4125479","4132080"," place where i see like it matters in after hours to trade es it matters during cash hours to trade"
"4132080","4141939"," spx or spy and i also compare the three uh in after hours or in cash market specifically so"
"4141939","4150260"," if i'm in like um if i'm in like um let's say i'm in a position on spy uh in"
"4150260","4159859"," the daytime i will check i'll cycle between es spy aspects and see what they're saying as well do i"
"4159859","4166740"," prefer uh i already said it so esi prefer after hours in pre-market overnight and then i prefer spx"
"4166740","4182859"," and spyder in the daytime it's a good question you"
"4182859","4187899"," guys want to look at nvda hold on i missed some what you guys are saying on youtube hold on"
"4190939","4197960"," a second here i saw nvda but yeah there's bounces along the way like look i'm not saying you're"
"4197960","4203320"," going straight to ninety six dollars don't like oftentimes i'm misquoted so i don't want to be"
"4203320","4211460"," misquoted here like i get i get misquoted a lot like i get i get misquoted pretty much like"
"4211460","4216340"," telephone if we set in a room and i draw something on your back on a piece of paper and"
"4216340","4221360"," then you read it and then you drop or somebody else but at time like some of the things that"
"4221360","4228200"," i get signed to saying i'm like that never even happened like didn't even happen so like there's"
"4228200","4232300"," yeah if we go down if tassel starts to reject it's going to be a process it's not going to"
"4232300","4240040"," be it's not going to be like um it's not going to be like you know next week that it"
"4240040","4245140"," happens there are nothing's a straight line it wants nothing's a straight line up or down's never a"
"4245140","4249800"," straight line please don't ever assign that like straight down shit to me or anything like that"
"4249800","4259020"," nothing you're trying to but please don't how do we rebound it's it's rebounding right now so"
"4259020","4264440"," tesla's being bought on the daily trigger you want to see it well we'll do uh daily trigger and"
"4264440","4274380"," we're going to do uh hold on a second here so we're going to do uh tesla"
"4274380","4281160"," is being bought right now do you see it so this is tesla chart what are you going to expect"
"4281160","4292360"," here from tesla let's look at it in a one minute it's a one minute tesla chart right bears"
"4292360","4301440"," are looking for what here they've got their first test right now right you see it it's likely going"
"4301440","4308240"," to reject and then you're likely going to get this squeeze higher and what i want to show you here"
"4308240","4317480"," is who's in charge right now sellers are right so intraday velocity right intraday uh"
"4317480","4322620"," bearishness right where is a bear what is a bear want to sell it i don't i don't know if"
"4322620","4329220"," i can switch this chart upside down i wish i could maybe i can hold on a second here let"
"4330920","4334160"," me see if i can switch this chart upside down give me one quick second i can possibly do this"
"4334160","4343700"," uh hold on a second here let me see uh flip vertical maybe"
"4343700","4353660"," oh yeah baby okay so can i"
"4353660","4361040"," flip that vertical can you guys can see that vertical right so pretend we're going up right now if"
"4361040","4367740"," you're a bull and you can't understand this normally let's explain this to in a better way right so"
"4367740","4375080"," we're upside down right now right so right now they're going to try to sell this to get above right"
"4375080","4381820"," does that look normal to you right there right so they're going to try to sell this to get"
"4381820","4389080"," underneath the daily trigger right here right i think that they fail there so i think they're going"
"4389080","4395000"," to do it again and then it's going to pull back right here and that's where your real support is"
"4395000","4403600"," going to be this is what you you need this to break through you understand like you need this help"
"4403600","4410580"," in my view to get through the daily trigger so yeah you're going to attack it you're going to"
"4410580","4415160"," attack it you're going to pull back and you're going to grind up and then break through does that"
"4415160","4421980"," make sense maybe maybe a bull understands this better usually what happens is not like yeah we're"
"4421980","4427540"," up here yeah we're just running to the downside unless you get some news now this is an upside down"
"4427540","4432660"," chart for tesla so i want you to like see this you get a chance here right now you're going"
"4432660","4440000"," to get one more chance and likely you're going to need this hourly trigger to actually actually"
"4440000","4447640"," break through with conviction to the downside does that make sense so you need this right here in"
"4447640","4455760"," my view to break through that right there does that make sense now if we do bring in a breakthrough"
"4455760","4461500"," right now if we do roll over here we start just blasting one minute the one minute comes over"
"4462080","4467840"," usually there's you're going to need some bad bad news like bad like unknown news to the market uh"
"4467840","4473320"," and you'll end up getting that you know the one minute the five minute takes it down and we start"
"4473320","4479480"," blasting down here um but the one in five minute likely can't break the daily trigger it's not it's"
"4479480","4485720"," not enough force to break the daily trigger in my view this guy this is helping you guys if you're"
"4485720","4492400"," a but if you're a bully you're probably like what the fuck is he doing right now here you go"
"4492400","4500980"," bears in bulls so you get what i'm saying here so if you're a bear what are you trying to"
"4500980","4510080"," do trying to sell this right here right you really want to sell this does that make sense right"
"4510080","4516060"," there that's really what you want to be selling and if you're a bull you don't have a trade unless"
"4516060","4521660"," you get above right here just see what i'm saying so even if we break down here you need that"
"4521660","4529580"," hourly trigger to send you below does that make sense you need this you need this hourly trigger to"
"4529580","4543820"," push the market lower does that help you guys or no yeah"
"4546220","4552060"," yeah so i mean it's either time it's either going to be time it's either going to be time-based"
"4552060","4558220"," so let me go back to that trigger screen so watch this again so right now it's either time-based"
"4558220","4567560"," so you either see the squeeze higher right or it gets pin sideways right if it gets pin sideways in"
"4567560","4574940"," time passes do do do and our passes and our passes and our passes and our passes yeah if you"
"4574940","4579860"," have the hourly trigger right here i'll give fuck yeah you can go down from now right so we're"
"4579860","4587100"," going to track the hourly trigger see where it sits right and wherever this hourly trigger is is"
"4587100","4596670"," going to be the place that we sell does that make sense to you guys like that screen flip right"
"4596670","4605410"," there you weren't expecting that magic where you you weren't expecting that magic where you so"
"4605410","4614770"," someone commented earlier i wouldn't be long here right and yeah when people say that to me i go"
"4614770","4618990"," they're out of their fucking minds they don't know what they're talking about you got him saying uh"
"4618990","4627750"," so you know if they don't if they can't see that there's an issue it's like basic 101 shit so"
"4627750","4638510"," it's like it's basic shit bra so you got to be you got to be quieted down here yeah we"
"4638510","4643350"," should squeeze so now why do i have this up here do you want to see why i have this"
"4643350","4648650"," up here why i say sell this right here not this right here why am i saying so let's see"
"4648650","4654990"," where the let's see where the hourly trigger is let's take a look at it uh the hourly trigger on"
"4654990","4664690"," spy hold on here so let's look at where the hour and half hour is we got um"
"4664690","4674350"," 440 16 wait down here it's the half hour trigger or this is the half hour trigger right here"
"4674350","4684350"," the uh hourly trigger is 448 98 i think you guys think that i"
"4684350","4689170"," like i intentionally like tell you lies there's some shit i think i essentially don't want you to"
"4689170","4695210"," know certain things so here's the hourly trigger here's the gray bar of love here's the cellot tag"
"4695210","4699690"," now why do i have this cellot tag and this cell bar down here and i'm going to show you"
"4699690","4718620"," guys why right now so in a one hour time frame right here i want"
"4718620","4724280"," you to see this right here so just coming up in here i want you to see i'm going to"
"4724280","4732220"," draw this line for you right now i want you to see that crossover right there and then i want"
"4732220","4736700"," you to see this cross right here see how this thing's like a bad out of hell coming down it's"
"4736700","4744480"," like just racing down here to sell this you see that just like racing where is that it's right"
"4744480","4751740"," there you see it right there so if you get any kind of a push up here at any point"
"4751740","4758660"," you're gonna want to sell the fuck out of that right there right it just straight sell that right"
"4758660","4766740"," there now if we don't squeeze up here on the hourly we don't squeeze above here what are we looking"
"4766740","4774440"," for it's time to pass right so forget that this hourly trigger marches down right and price is"
"4774440","4780940"," being pinned and this eventually comes down i'm then going to expect we sell that right so i'm"
"4780940","4785840"," selling this right here because of the hourly trigger the cross right there the cross right here"
"4785840","4791880"," that makes sense you'll sell that right there but right now where we are in the day today right now"
"4791880","4797760"," we're likely going up right we're likely going up we're likely going to squeeze and reset to the"
"4797760","4804380"," downside so we slammed into this daily trigger what are you looking for for that next leg down you"
"4804380","4816040"," know you're looking for something like this right here and blast down into friday so"
"4816040","4823240"," i don't know if we begin to roll we begin to roll otherwise otherwise uh upside waiting for the"
"4823240","4836110"," upside here waiting for time to pass i guess"
"4836110","4841370"," i would i guess i would switch to puts if we did this at any point we started like half"
"4841370","4846670"," our bar and this stuff yeah i'd fucking i'd get some puts right there if you're like half our bar"
"4846670","4850410"," it was a half our bar below the daily trigger that's i'll give you another way that i'd take this"
"4850410","4859150"," let's go to a 30 minute chart if you show me there's a half our chart right here"
"4859150","4868870"," if you show me a closing red bar below the daily trigger a closing closed below"
"4868870","4875510"," the daily trigger i'll jump on board for that trade down there uh but i'd need one full closing bar"
"4875510","4883310"," so what look at this half our bar right here i want to say it here whoop what do i"
"4883310","4893230"," do here see this bar right here in the half our not a closing"
"4893230","4903180"," bar to the downside right not a half our closing bar right i would need a bar to"
"4903180","4909720"," begin right here and close right there you get a closing full closing out bar bar below the daily"
"4909720","4915920"," trigger and i'll i'll take you up on that how does that represent itself so if we're on spy right"
"4915920","4925400"," now 30 minute chart this thing looks so wonky just get rid of it"
"4925400","4935180"," so just look closely here see that same bar right there that's the half our"
"4935180","4945140"," bar right did not close below closed higher if you gave me a"
"4945140","4952520"," half our closing bar right here and it's below this line right here give"
"4952520","4962480"," me a half i will definitely"
"4962480","4967920"," look for like a high point right here to sell this down so yeah if we did that i would"
"4967920","4972460"," do it i'd take a short there but other than that happening uh unless you get a half an our"
"4972460","4980220"," closing bar below uh four forty five fifty three no go for me no go as far as i see"
"4980220","4989280"," it it's uh seldom as far as i see it it's a cycle out of puts and reset reset we're"

"5703450","5708190"," there's a break there is like three out of ten so like you're a losing trader so i don't believe"
"5708190","5715910"," like not you specifically but like uh if you're at resistance or support you take the money and run"
"5715910","5723850"," you reset to break through it like seven out of ten times so if you're like no no no just"
"5723850","5727210"," break through and that's what happens i'm like now you're fucking wrong like you might be right"
"5727210","5733110"," once but you're not right uh seven or eight or nine times then you disappear not you specifically"
"5733110","5739850"," that's what they do they disappear and that's for bulls and bears at support at resistance doesn't"
"5739850","5749570"," matter same thing and then they're just gone yeah they are i i'm just i'm waiting for the squeeze"
"5749570","5762470"," so squeeze their time one or the other see"

"5807960","5823060"," uh trigger screen nvda right nice"
"5825560","5835320"," so this is nvda we got our implied move right here right never tagged our downside implied"
"5835320","5842680"," move did we oh yeah baby down there never touched that did we we also know that the dip was"
"5842680","5849400"," bought here we know the dip was bought there the dip was bought there we know the dip was bought"
"5849400","5860660"," right there right so are you under the impression here that you buy the step here or"
"5860660","5868640"," are you under the impression that you don't buy the dip right big question mark right nvda are you"
"5868640","5878020"," buying the step or no so if this worked for you one time two times three times uh"
"5878020","5885600"," and you lost to this trade right so question mark becomes you lost this trade would you would you"
"5885600","5893960"," be this trader here where you buy this dip buy this dip buy this dip and listen to someone in"

"5911800","5916700"," we know you wouldn't buy that dip because you lost we know that you wouldn't have bought it again"
"5916700","5925160"," because you lost you lost again and you lost again right one two three"

"5980210","5985310"," look at this real quick real real quick this you know i wouldn't buy this but someone else did"
"5985310","5989470"," right they bought it there they bought it there squeezed up higher so if you're a bear and you're"
"5989470","5996910"," like eh cap i want a short nvidia again i hate it been hating on it all year long where"
"5996910","6006860"," is your next short where is your next short nvidia you have two places right you"
"6006860","6014440"," got a place to short nvidia right here right there's your first place to short nvidia right there"
"6014440","6022660"," and where's your next place to short nvda it's down here it's below the daily trigger"
"6022660","6032340"," let me explain this better to you let me like zigzag this for you right"
"6035510","6044710"," so where are you entering you're entering right here right to pay this right here right do you"
"6044710","6056540"," leave the short on right here no don't you take the money and run right and"
"6056540","6064000"," what you're doing then is you're waiting for so you blast up here you come down here right you whoo"
"6064000","6070140"," take the money and run baby right and then we come back up here and that's your next short right"
"6071180","6077040"," that's your next entry right there right you now also have the hourly trigger and the daily trigger"
"6077040","6082640"," on your side and there's your big move down right big money right there right does it make sense"
"6082640","6090180"," big money big money right big money now let's say we don't squeeze up here on nvidia let's say we"
"6090180","6098160"," don't squeeze here so let's say there's no squeeze we start blasting down right whoo do you get"
"6098160","6107780"," short right here fuck no why it's likely going to squeeze up on you and need to be rejected so"
"6107780","6115320"," if you're a bear where we are you're actually waiting for the break below the rejection on the"
"6115320","6121600"," daily trigger and then you tag it right there does that make sense and that's where the money shot"
"6121600","6128720"," is right there so you're looking for these two things right you're looking for either up here or a"
"6128720","6138600"," break below daily trigger and rejection so if you're looking for the next short on nvDA you are"
"6138600","6147760"," looking for the break below a candle higher right here and then a rejection candle and when you get"
"6147760","6153760"," if you get that rejection candle you're on that one for a significant low it's like most of the"
"6153760","6159140"," move is gone at this point right like most of the move is gone right you got a little bit"
"6159140","6162740"," left I guess you could I guess you could take that if you wanted to but I would take the"
"6162740","6168080"," money and run there and then look for the next leg like this next leg is a big one so"
"6168080","6176200"," I guess I guess I guess if you're a bear on nvDA you could be short here down to 458"
"6176200","6183120"," 10 4 56 maybe somewhere down in here maybe 454 how about 4 55 I'll give you 4 55 you"
"6183120","6188020"," could be short here on nvDA down to 4 55 and then I would let it off and then get"
"6188020","6196960"," back in on it for the or continued downside so like 4 55 something like that nvDA possible um like"
"6196960","6201480"," immediate more more downside to come but the bigger trait is that like the big fat part of this"
"6201480","6206700"," trait like are you short from here you could be in it if you're short from here you could stay"
"6206700","6211200"," in it but if you're like I just got short right here you're gonna have a bad time like more"
"6211200","6221160"," than likely but the next move whenever this shit happens right"
"6221160","6231160"," here if that happen that's too much if if we break and don't come back up"
"6231160","6240890"," for air like any of this shit right here if you see anything like this um your next"
"6240890","6250590"," target down there's 417 actually less 415 right there and that's a that's the next giant move like"
"6250590","6259690"," you're talking about collecting peanuts right here when this is big money like huge money the"
"6259690","6269470"," downside nvDA still tapping down here"
"6269470","6274290"," still no new low right now trying to get some closing uh bars down below the daily trigger right"
"6274290","6279070"," here if we get a rejection up here I will take some puts and close calls right up here if"
"6279070","6286170"," that happens and try to take this next leg down uh still in calls right now have not sold no"
"6286170","6294330"," sound in 25 uh 4 47 c still still have not sold looking for that rejection below daily trigger or"
"6294330","6299870"," time to pass for the hourly trigger to come down uh still not a buyer of puts down here want"
"6299870","6332100"," nothing to do with it so"
"6332100","6339320"," we're gonna show this to a better way for you guys still long calls there just playing the waiting"

"6380160","6388200"," a viable bottom here like there's like a viable bottom here and I want to I'm going to give it"
"6388200","6395100"," to a quick poll here and see I'm always fascinated by uh let me see if I don't know why"
"6395100","6403420"," it's not on hold on a second here there it is so let me ask you guys a quet this"
"6403420","6407680"," is what I want to ask you guys things because when we're on tops or bottoms I always want to"
"6407680","6417520"," know how bullish and bearish you are like so I'm going to do a poll right now right oh bullish"
"6417520","6427680"," or bearish are you I don't know"
"6427680","6439120"," if that's the best way to afford it hold on bullish or bearish are you one"
"6439120","6449150"," option one is going to be this is bottom add"
"6452290","6461390"," a little more down to go two go a"
"6461390","6470770"," little more down to go that's command two next thing would be"
"6470770","6485230"," market crash three add"
"6485230","6492510"," a little more down this is bottom a little more down to go market crash um what would be another"
"6492510","6498050"," option this is bottom a little more down to go market crash hold on this is bottom a little more"
"6498050","6508010"," down to go uh give me 440 please I think that would be my answer that's going to be"
"6508010","6514470"," number four well this is bottom yeah we'll add that one I think we're done okay let me see if"
"6514470","6523310"," I can start this start pull can you guys see this pull there's a pull for you to uh fill"
"6523310","6533030"," out so the answers are exclamation mark vot space bar one two three four the question is"
"6533030","6538030"," how bullish or bearish are you the reason I'm asking you this question is not trick question in any"
"6538030","6547930"," way shape or form this is a an exercise for you to gauge your own uh bias so the"
"6547930","6556130"," bias here is am I extremely bullish extremely bearish and are we close to a bottom market crash"
"6556130","6561930"," whatever if you don't see an answer there pick the one that's closest to what you think the reason"
"6561930","6568570"," I'm asking you this question is because uh where are you I want you to compare this to what were"
"6568570","6575750"," your thoughts yesterday the day before uh last week uh your thesis right does it change your thesis"
"6575750","6581830"," does it say to you like um well we're down here it kind of reminds me of like when we're"
"6581830","6589490"," topping on a run is there more like for me is there more down to go likely uh is there"
"6589490","6598070"," likely a bottom there uh likely I'm not asking you in this pull specifically like uh does that dip"
"6598070","6603750"," that gets bought gets sold later on or anything like that I'm asking mostly because uh as an"
"6603750","6611310"," exercise of your bearish or bullishness like I'm just starting to get bullish on like an intraday"
"6611310","6618410"," so like if we hit 440 like that's where I'm like max bullish like buy that fucking dip slam 30"
"6618410","6624630"," 000 dollars down on it and ride that fuck her up um well like I guess my my my bear"
"6624630","6628870"," like I was bearish into the clothes yesterday and I'm like if I was like if I was like getting"
"6628870","6633290"," bearish into the clothes like if I was like a three and bearish I'm like that's a seven bearish"
"6633290","6638990"," right now so once I hit like 10 bearish I'm like I'm out I'm not bearish anymore so I guess"
"6638990","6645050"," that's why I'm asking you guys that question are you like ultra extreme bearish here ultra extreme"
"6645050","6652550"," bullish uh we all want to know maybe I should give like price targets as an expo do you see"
"6652550","6659330"," 440 as the target do you maybe consider the chat do you see the 440 so pull out it's gonna"
"6659330","6666350"," have a five minute chart here do you see the the cap wants to buy a dip at 440 down"
"6666350","6675110"," here as the as the actual move like the downside move is to 440 or do you"
"6675110","6682190"," this entire move here by the way is uh the entire gap or the entire squeeze this is the entire"
"6682190","6692110"," squeeze I should rewrite that entire squeeze I said squeeze we'll just write leave it at"
"6692110","6701030"," squeeze entire squeeze it's like that becomes the question like do you see this I see this in the"
"6701030","6707450"," friday I see that easily uh easily see that in the friday do you see that or no are you"
"6707450","6713530"," just starting to get bullish here uh like like nvda is saying buy right now nvda is like fuck it"
"6713530","6719570"," it's another dollar or two just go long throw spread on and check back in a month uh I still"
"6719570","6724650"," think we have more down to go so I'm wondering what your bearishness like your level of bearishness"
"6724650","6738050"," is here like how bearish are you so we"
"6738050","6747760"," can show that to you right now breaking below daily trigger right now let me see what you guys are"
"6747760","6754180"," answering right now so far I've got uh this is bottom eight votes I'm surprised at that I don't see"
"6754180","6762440"," this as the bottom still you're fucking bullish good job uh a little bit more down to go 15 votes"
"6762440","6769880"," uh that's the most under under choices so far I think that's reasonable to expect uh more down to"
"6769880","6776240"," go I think that's good to see uh market crash four votes uh I don't I think if you're looking"
"6776240","6782940"," for the market crash uh I think you can get that acceleration but I think it's gonna take time uh"
"6782940","6788480"," so if you're a voter of market crash do you think it takes time like two or three weeks or"
"6788480","6798420"," are you thinking like this week right now do you think if you say"
"6798420","6802420"," three weeks I'm gonna believe you if you say like today or tomorrow I think you're out of your"
"6802420","6809460"," fucking mind but be honest I won't ban you I promise I'm just gonna demod your ass because I think"
"6809460","6820980"," you're crazy who's voting market crash number five I'm just kidding let"
"6823820","6827900"," me see you guys are saying 440 definitely probable on distribution curves it could be a little bit"
"6827900","6833680"," more down to go yeah I'm on the 440 that's why I think we hit 440 bit Friday I'm a"
"6833680","6837240"," little I'm a little upset right now I didn't buck so I was gonna fucking max buy that shit"
"6837240","6843800"," yesterday I'm so angry right now like I would have I fucking 440 p's dude fucking for monday dude"
"6843800","6856460"," 23 cents they were fucking pennies pennies dude we're in stream yesterday I was like fuck uh"
"6856460","6861940"," yeah I think the I think the max downside today is um like max downside for the rest of the"
"6861940","6869840"," day is right here at 442 75 like if there is more downside move it's probably right there probably"
"6869840","6874340"," somewhere in there it's kind of if we're gonna go down there start rejecting this stuff and start"
"6874340","6880380"," heading down boom something like that and way over at 330 more downside to 440 75 maybe a little"
"6880380","6886260"," bit of foam won't move to the downside we start breaking down there I'll switch over though still"
"6886260","6892320"," no interest for me I fucking hate buying this shit dude like buying buying puts down here then they"
"6892320","6900320"," squeeze me up and I get fucked I want nothing to do with it come on I've been caught in"
"6900320","6905480"," that shit I know exactly what but being a bag holder for puts you can fuck off if"
"6907370","6916810"," we get to 440 that's what my thesis is my thesis is"
"6916810","6924990"," like if we go to 440 I'll tell you this I got a shit ton of money in the sidelines"
"6924990","6933250"," we trade 440 uh uh I'm gonna full on tell you right then in there that uh I'm gonna I'm"
"6933250","6942990"," gonna I'm gonna there'll be no dip buy for me until April zero zero long in this market no"
"6942990","6948830"," matter where we go we trade 440 I don't care I'm just trying to sell at that point so there's"
"6948830","6955750"," no both thesis at 440 in my view there's no time I don't think bulls have the time to get"
"6955750","6960330"," what they like there's like a so we're buying in October and December and then March we're buying"
"6960330","6968010"," again you know where it's going you have like this huge move ahead of you do we have like let"
"6968010","6972710"," me ask you that question let's be honest about this if you're a bull out there right when we were"
"6972710","6980970"," buying in October December and March in January we were here buying all that shit right the thesis"
"6980970","6989810"," in October December and March is we can go all the way up to all-time highs right so you"
"6989810","6994490"," got this like you got this like um I need to put my money to work right do you guys"
"6994490","7001690"," remember this stuff let me make let's do a little rewind here let's do a little rewind let's do a"
"7001690","7010730"," little rewind so in May June of 2022 right we bounced we bounced again in August I believe"
"7010730","7020130"," and then in October we had that last bounce so the idea there is that if you're buying those"
"7020130","7028310"," dips but 10 this is like May August and October right your upside potential is like way up here"
"7028310","7038110"," does that make sense to you so the question becomes like yeah"
"7038110","7042150"," do we run this out to all-time highs sure we'll give it a chance to get up there and"
"7042150","7047970"," do that but the idea here is like we don't have a lot of time right time is always like"
"7047970","7055150"," I was talking matter manner of time so if we have the seasonally worst time of the year is winter"
"7055150","7062770"," spring you know like how much more room and time do we have to go there before seasonal weakness"
"7062770","7068030"," comes into play like when does it begin to matter does it matter on September 1st or December 8th"
"7068030","7073450"," probably not but like as you're burning those weeks like you burned all of August we burned August"
"7073450","7080170"," right and now we're burning September right now you're you're gonna try to tell me that you're"
"7080170","7089910"," gonna have like this like best winter of all time it's maybe maybe history is against your side"
"7089910","7099270"," so do you have like this epic like we just start blasting higher from like four four hundred or 420"
"7099270","7109090"," we trade 480 by January 1 probably not will you trade that by February or for April probably"
"7109090","7115290"," not probably a fair chance of that not happening and you know they're gonna cut rates at some point"
"7115290","7123850"," you know like you know by you know by springtime is like the ticker you know the alarm clock starts"
"7123850","7129730"," in spring you know even if it doesn't happen even if the feds tell and you're gonna be higher for"
"7129730","7138050"," longer you and I both know that once once like February comes around you got the you got the you"
"7138050","7143990"," got the stopwatch on do you do I think that the fed is going to be able to raise rates"
"7143990","7151570"," through the next presidential election fuck no so we have an election coming up next year right is"
"7151570","7160810"," it next year is it 2024 right so you kind of figure like from spring until the election"
"7160810","7169950"," that either at a politician is gonna make that happen where they cut rates or the fed is gonna have"
"7169950","7176210"," to wrap it up for a new regime so you know there is like there's like a timer and you"
"7176210","7182950"," set that timer and you say to the fed do your thing man but at some point that's not gonna"
"7182950","7189970"," fly you know it's not gonna fly you're not gonna have rates at 20% too much greed I'll tell"
"7189970","7194030"," you that there's too much greed for that so they're gonna try to time that right and time that roll"
"7194030","7199730"," over in the market and as time passes all those months burn away and they're on there you know like"
"7199730","7204290"," you can you can threaten all you want at some point it's just not gonna happen you're not gonna get"
"7204290","7209470"," fired you're not getting five years of raising rates do you think that maybe you do maybe you in"
"7209470","7215270"," your mind think you're getting five years of raising rates that ain't happening you're like the far"
"7215270","7225220"," side of that happening yeah strong opinions loosely held absolutely the moment"
"7225220","7229960"," you start breaking you start selling right moment you start bouncing you start buying same thing"
"7229960","7234960"," there's nobody to the crystal ball there you start you start buying or you like start bouncing you"
"7234960","7240540"," buy you know you're not short anyone that's doing that shit is fucking broke uh you start selling"
"7240540","7244680"," off like we start selling this daily trigger here I can't be long there I gotta cut them loose so"
"7244680","7254650"," yeah if you're on"

"7261210","7268910"," want to stay long on those puts close them out of like 455ish 45550 or something like that if"
"7268910","7272850"," you're like hey I want to stay short and I want to close them right now like 455 you should"

"9976410","9982410"," not but uh there's so there's an idea behind the idea there's an idea behind price and the number"
"9982410","9988410"," of people that actually own it so you'll have like a declining uh number of number of holders of"
"9988410","9993250"," that price so if you got a hundred a ten people in pay at two hundred dollars and then you've"

"10662670","10667570"," like i need to put some risk somewhere and make more than beating inflation do you understand that"
"10667570","10672770"," concept like i have to make money on this money now can't just sit there for a year beating"
"10672770","10679230"," inflation so you either have to roll it into commercial real estate if they roll it into bonds if"
"10679230","10687670"," they roll it into residential real estate or into the market right the stock market you need it to"
"10687670","10694710"," grow for you at some point so you figure in october december march everyone's loading up in the"

"17456660","17460320"," well no sorry there's one other thing i wanted to tell you someone just said uh why you trading"
"17460320","17468360"," esta and not spy puts uh i find that i get better i get paid better on it it's more"
"17468360","17474400"," consistent spy puts are not built they're not literally not built for you to make money uh they're"
"17474400","17479420"," not built to hold value they're directional only in my view from my experience and why they were"
"17479420","17485640"," invented and how they're built their whole thesis of spy puts is that they are crash they're"
"17485640","17491500"," protection for underlying only they're not to be traded they're not meant to be they're meant to be"
"17491500","17496040"," thrown away they're meant to be protector underlying assets in the marketplace so i don't trade spy"
"17496040","17503920"," puts i don't mind selling the market on futures i don't mind uh synthetically doing it through an"
"17503920","17512780"," actual underlying uh option that holds value so for me estal calls they hold value i don't look at"
"17512780","17519900"," them they just stay there i don't touch them they're like they work every time every single time"
"17519900","17525940"," spy puts no thank you like path tag it have to get out can't leave them on uh sometimes you"
"17525940","17532160"," can but that 20 percent or nine out of ten times you can't so i'm not i don't bother with"
"17532160","17537460"," it nine out of ten times you lose that i lose that trade so i've got no wants or needs"
"17537460","17542700"," for spy puts can suck my balls don't ever never think they're never going to trade spy puts for"
"17542700","17549480"," like making money like i'm going to make my living off spy spy deserates never happening never ever"

"17568860","17575600"," dog dare anyone to come on this show and trade spy puts regularly dare anybody because i know"
"17575600","17581360"," you're gonna get fucking destroyed i guess we're in a bear market they pay they pay really well in"
"17581360","17588920"," bear markets uh 2022 uh when we were selling down spy zero dates puts were fucking baller but you"
"17588920","17593380"," saw all the money come into those like the market came like money came into the market for those"
"17593380","17598860"," spy puts i should be i should rephrase that spy zero dates are great when we're a bear market but"
"17598860","17603000"," we're not in a bear market we're fucking trading four hundred and forty five dollars we were at"
"17603000","17609440"," four fifty nine like two weeks ago uh so we're not there where spy puts actually pay on zero dates"

"17657960","17662860"," i'm not talking about tax advantages stuff like i'm talking about mechanics of it so the mechanics"
"17662860","17668380"," of a spy put is to protect an underlying asset it's not for you to actually make money therefore"
"17668380","17674820"," like we go down three hundred points and you get paid you're meant to like i don't know the math"
"17674820","17679340"," anymore but i used to know the math like do you want a million dollars in spy right and it's"
"17679340","17686800"," going to go up two or three dollars versus you buying you know like uh fucking i don't know"
