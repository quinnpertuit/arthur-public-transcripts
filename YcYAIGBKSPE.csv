"YcYAIGBKSPE","271000","275000"," You can see we're actually still bullish right here. I want you to know this, okay?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","275000","279000"," So we're actually just going to my cursor right now. I'll bring up Bookmap for you"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","279000","283000"," in the background here. You know what? I don't have Bookmap up, do I?"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","305000","309000"," Okay, let's see if we can bring this up for you. There you go."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","309000","313000"," You know what's funny is I was just thinking about"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","313000","317000"," I heard a story about another streamer that was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","317000","321000"," I heard a story about another streamer that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","321000","325000"," was caught at what he was. This is a financial streamer and supposedly"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","325000","329000"," he had some"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","329000","333000"," porn up or something. He got caught live in the stream. I'm not going to name who it was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","333000","337000"," but I'm not"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","337000","341000"," going to name names here but"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","341000","345000"," you guys probably know"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","345000","349000"," who he is. We got caught playing porn or something in the background."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","349000","353000"," This is hilarious. No one wants to get caught in any kind of"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","353000","357000"," gun compromising positions. I have another streamer friend."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","357000","361000"," I'm not going to name his name. He's in here sometimes."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","361000","365000"," He's never told anybody that he was a streamer but he got caught with a woman"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","365000","369000"," on live stream once. It was kind of funny too."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","369000","373000"," We're going to talk about some stuff here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","373000","377000"," this morning or this afternoon. I'm going to take book map back off."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","377000","381000"," The conversation that I had was with this friend."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","381000","385000"," I'll leave this up actually for you. I'm just going to talk to you at this point."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","385000","389000"," We got some time here. We're still bullish here. I just want you to know that we are bullish to go"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","389000","393000"," higher here and attack, close up some of these gaps left above."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","393000","397000"," You can see these gaps on, remove book map. You see some gaps"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","397000","401000"," above here. There will be some resistance"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","401000","405000"," here of course so we have some trouble here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","405000","409000"," We have some work to do but we're still trading above the one minute"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","409000","413000"," here so there's no reason why we can't grind through here. Does that mean you should be in this? Probably not."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","413000","417000"," You want to see every one of these legs, right?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","417000","421000"," You come up here and take a leg, right? You wait and then here's the trade, take it up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","421000","425000"," and then you let the algos do the work in here, right? And then you look"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","425000","429000"," for this move higher, right? Can we grind from here?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","429000","433000"," Sure. Is it worth grinding here? Time wise? Probably not. It's"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","433000","437000"," 143 in the afternoon. Is it really worth your time?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","437000","441000"," You should have made two kick ass trades at this point. There's no reason for you to have not"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","441000","445000"," made two kick ass trades at this point. We're going to talk about"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","445000","449000"," yesterday and what happened yesterday because"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","449000","453000"," we're two for two now, right? We traded Netflix this way"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","453000","457000"," and we traded Microsoft this way"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","457000","461000"," and I was on the phone this morning with somebody and I was like"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","461000","465000"," the cacophony on Fintuit."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","465000","469000"," They were missing the point. This is before Microsoft"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","469000","473000"," bounced this morning and my point this morning on the phone was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","473000","477000"," that you have to understand that Microsoft"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","477000","481000"," and Google take up such a piece of tech, NASDAQ"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","481000","485000"," they're an everyday thing, right?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","485000","489000"," And we all know that they need a leg up on AI"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","489000","493000"," and you heard the ER yesterday and the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","493000","497000"," truth is you want it to see Microsoft"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","497000","501000"," invest in the future of AI and that's the onus is now on"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","501000","505000"," Google to come out on their ER and say hey we're"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","505000","509000"," investing in this because this is something that's the future"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","509000","513000"," for tech, right? Whether it does or doesn't and it will"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","513000","517000"," be front run. Yesterday's ER"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","517000","521000"," Microsoft decided to go with good news first, bad news"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","521000","525000"," after. The key to watch yesterday was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","525000","529000"," you guys know that we have expected"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","529000","533000"," range, right? And so we trade up to that expected range"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","533000","537000"," and then sell off or down to that expected range and then usually"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","537000","541000"," go up unless there's some unknown news that's bad"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","541000","545000"," or good. So if there was something unknown, the issue"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","545000","549000"," we asked for is ER is that all the good news came out first. So we blasted up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","549000","553000"," we sold and there was a trigger to sell there unless"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","553000","557000"," we started to find that retailers"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","557000","561000"," were buying at that top and we started to rip even"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","561000","565000"," higher, right?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","565000","569000"," You would end up getting dealers"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","569000","573000"," chasing at that point. That didn't happen."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","573000","577000"," I didn't take the money and run, but the key about yesterday was this morning I was talking about"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","577000","581000"," buddy about was I was like no one paid attention to the structure"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","581000","585000"," of that ER house presented and then no one paid attention to what was the key and the key was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","585000","589000"," AI investment."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","589000","593000"," And I said to him this morning I'm actually bullish on Microsoft right now"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","593000","597000"," this morning and that it will probably get bought and it did get"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","597000","601000"," bought this morning. That was a key"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","601000","605000"," thing about Microsoft and now the onus is on Google"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","605000","609000"," and what they're going to come out with. Even if you guys have to understand that part of"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","609000","613000"," a recession has been priced in. People say"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","613000","617000"," it hasn't been priced in. It has to an extent been priced in. Does that mean we're"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","617000","621000"," done going down? I don't think so. I think when they pause rates we're going to go down"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","621000","625000"," one more time what that price is and where we're at in the market I don't know."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","625000","629000"," I can't give you that number."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","629000","633000"," But I do want you to know that part of this recession has been"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","633000","637000"," priced in at this point and we try to say that it hasn't been but it has."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","637000","641000"," So I want you to always be"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","641000","645000"," forward looking because banks are always forward looking and they were"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","645000","649000"," forward looking and that's why Microsoft got bought this morning to what was actually"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","649000","653000"," said in that ER. Now the other conversation I have with a friend was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","653000","657000"," I had two people this morning I called that I trust and I said"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","657000","661000"," because all I heard was Tesla Tesla bearish bearish bearish bearish bearish"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","661000","665000"," everybody's going short in Tesla everybody's buying puts on Tesla"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","747000","751000"," I'm like I hope that I'm like I hope what I'm hoping is that we have a slow bleed down to the end of the day"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","751000","755000"," when people get more bearish and more bearish"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","755000","759000"," and more bearish and then end of the day we're just bleeding off"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","787000","791000"," it and gives the bad news and we actually tagged some known support"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","791000","795000"," then they hit us with the good news and we just blast off"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","795000","799000"," what you could do is wait until spy sells off to the end"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","799000","803000"," right then at that like 414 you buy calls you couldn't do this with"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","803000","807000"," Tesla but you could do with spy or cues and then by open tomorrow"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","807000","811000"," Tesla would blast off having trapped all these bull bears in over here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","811000","815000"," every single one of them and that didn't happen what really happened was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","815000","819000"," right on the bell today we started selling and everybody their sister just said"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","859000","863000"," what we need for you to get a paid payday it's big"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","863000","867000"," I think it's big I could be wrong here maybe we do go down that low but I'll tell you what"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","867000","871000"," 8% swing"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","871000","875000"," my guess is that uh I mean let's look at this"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","875000","879000"," my guess is that most of you out there were like there's six percent right here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","879000","883000"," this is at 136 I'm betting that most of you were thinking that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","883000","887000"," we were going to sell off today down here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","887000","891000"," 136 then right into the bell we were going to do this little joby right here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","891000","895000"," right and you were like oh yeah I got this 8% today shit"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","895000","899000"," here's my plan"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","899000","903000"," from this like 132 with the bell or some shit that puts you down to 125"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","903000","907000"," that means you if you're a bear or if you're a bull that's doing the wrong"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","907000","911000"," thing right guess what you need from here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","911000","915000"," you need a 13% drop you better fucking hope that news is that bad"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","915000","919000"," you better hope you better hope that you're getting a 13%"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","919000","923000"," drop between now and I don't know"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","923000","927000"," tomorrow morning it's a pretty big drop 12.8 for 12.2"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","927000","931000"," and that's like that's like you breaking even and if you're in puts"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","931000","935000"," that puts you like and then you got IV crush tomorrow"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","1684200","1708080"," slide move. Boom. And it's right here. Here's your tag. And we've got on the other side"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1708080","1716340"," of it. How does it feel being a bear now? Plied move of the downside is for January 27th."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1716340","1736320"," Now 133 77. Oh, man. This is what's priced into the market right now. This is what"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1736320","1747320"," price into the market right now. Oh, man. Right here. That's all the bulls have to hold."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1747320","1762320"," Who's the onus on right now? Look at that. Look at that. And if we get something bullish,"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1762320","1769320"," we know where the price target is, right? There it is up there. Look at how high that is."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1769320","1782320"," Look at that. There's got a lot of work to do here. Whole bunch of work."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1782320","1793320"," So what do I think? I think the trade is over. Do you want the truth? The last two trades down here,"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1793320","1799320"," the last two trades we did, Netflix and Microsoft, there was a trade on each of those trades."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1799320","1809320"," To me, there isn't. To me, the trade happened before end of day. So what would I be? What would I want here?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1809320","1817320"," I would like to see. There's the implied move. I would like to see this to cool off a little bit."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1817320","1828320"," And maybe get maybe get some dipage down in here. Maybe some bad news down here and then buy a dip tomorrow to be honest with you."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1828320","1835320"," That's my feeling. You can trade whatever you want. You can."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1835320","1845320"," You can keep blasting this up higher and stuff like that. If you stay above this blue line right here, you can keep trading higher."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1845320","1850320"," It's your previous high right here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1850320","1859320"," You guys already know that you want to see a new high every time we make a every time we make a."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1859320","1866320"," Every time we come up here in this blue line, you want to see a new high, right? And then no failure of a new high. It's always a new high."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1866320","1871320"," So I'll get rid of this."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1871320","1878320"," This yellow right here. You want to get a new high right here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1878320","1884320"," So if you get a new high, right, point my point is, if you get a new high, this is supportive right here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1884320","1893320"," So now you're going to take this trade and you need to get a new high. If you don't get a new high, we will trade back down to this green line right here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1893320","1897320"," We'll look back a little bit in the past five days."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1897320","1903320"," That's some points of resistance."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1903320","1908320"," That one right there."

"YcYAIGBKSPE","1980320","1988320"," If you can stay above this big blue line on the one minute, it's possible you could get up there."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1989320","1992320"," It's going to be hard, but it's possible."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","1992320","1997320"," If a bull's bullish here and they want to trade this up into the close,"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","2571080","2577080"," Almost done, but not done."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2578080","2583080"," Chaz brother, how are those three ninety sixes treating you right now?"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","2588080","2592080"," How are those treating? Can't be healthy. You guys don't understand."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2592080","2598080"," I'm trying to explain this morning. I posted that I pinned this shit to my to my to my profile this morning."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2598080","2602080"," I tried to explain that."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2602080","2607080"," We have some momentum coming up that we haven't seen in thirteen years."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2607080","2612080"," Thirteen years underneath the stock market."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2612080","2617080"," Thirteen years not to be trifled with."

"YcYAIGBKSPE","2635080","2640080"," I was a Joe or Chaz or someone and I was, I don't forget who or maybe it was James Roland."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2640080","2646080"," I'm not sure. But I was like, man, I was like, I was like, there's like a six hundred point move here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2646080","2648080"," Up or down."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2648080","2652080"," And you don't need the first hundred in either direction."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2652080","2659080"," This isn't like we break trend and we go down a hundred more. Like, it's not like we break a hundred points and we get in not just another hundred."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2659080","2665080"," You don't need that hundred where whichever way it breaks. You don't need it. There's so many points after it."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2665080","2672080"," That you'd be a lunatic to be trying to to be short or long here for, you know, there's just."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2672080","2677080"," You're talking about thirteen years coming together right now."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2677080","2683080"," And the move afterwards is so explosive that it doesn't fucking matter."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2683080","2689080"," Like the hundred points in here in this middle here means nothing."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2689080","2693080"," You'll get eight up and torn up in here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2693080","2697080"," Once this shit breaks up or down, it's on."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2697080","2702080"," You'll have time. You could like step right in and jump jump on it."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2702080","2704080"," It's a huge move coming."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2704080","2706080"," Huge move."

"YcYAIGBKSPE","2831080","2841320"," it there. But I'll tell you what this balance area right here. This push higher right here."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2841320","2856040"," Once we break. See this all in here. Right. Wherever we break. Whatever way we break in"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2856040","2863440"," here right. It's going to be huge moves down like a leg down a leg up. That kind of stuff."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2863440","2870680"," It's going to be it's going to be explosive. There's all this stuff in here man getting"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","2917160","2924360"," win but not convincingly. That's the key. Like you got to like convincingly smash it"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2924360","2930040"," down. Does that make sense? You need lower lows not higher lows with a red wick. Not"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","2930040","2934920"," a not a battle between bulls and bears. Not the bulls win in the next week. You have to"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","3528340","3535700"," The other thing about the Algos is it tends to like most algorithms, it tends to eventually"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3535700","3544100"," repeat itself. I was running it on like 5,000 bars and then 10,000 bars. I'm trying to run it on"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3544100","3550340"," like 20,000 to 30,000 bars right now and see if it doesn't what happens with algorithms typically"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3550340","3556500"," is you have to manage them becomes repetitive. Algos tend to want to eventually find a pattern"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3556580","3561540"," and repeat it over time. So I'm struggling with one of the algorithms right now."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3569140","3576420"," Did I see Boris post chart from around 2001? No. Can you send that to me Ryan or tag me in that?"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","3590180","3595380"," Seen as we're here for Tesla. We have a quick break right now of so we'll move this trigger"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3595380","3598980"," up here. We have a quick break of the one minute right now. I want to see Tesla hold this trigger."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3599780","3604420"," If it doesn't we're looking at now it's we're now we're looking at well 144 60 and we've got a"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3604420","3607780"," little bit higher food Tesla man killing the bears."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3609780","3617540"," So you got some places to look for support here below. We've got one 144 46 and"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3618180","3625540"," 141 89 if you wanted to take another trade on Tesla you want to see you want to wait for"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3625540","3629140"," there's a couple of things you're looking for. We got the new high right came here we got the new"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3629140","3634660"," high. We got a new high again this is pretty supportive right now so I'm not going to expect"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3634660","3640980"," yet that the bulls are going to give this up just yet. Man it's 238 so we might be starting another"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3640980","3647380"," ramp for an hour so we'll find out. See if we get one more ramp out of Tesla. Now this seems"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3647460","3648580"," pretty supportive at this point."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3666580","3672100"," It's more of like a half hour at the half hour you're looking to be at a new high around the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3672100","3677060"," half hour mark and then it should run for another hour. In this case where we're heading into three"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3677380","3685140"," 230 to 330 I would expect it to stop ramping at two at a three pm for today so we'll see if it"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3685140","3692820"," happens. We are losing the one minute right now on Tesla. You don't want to see that. What was"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3692820","3699060"," the high there 146 50? To monitor it if it comes back above the thing for Tesla if you wanted to"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3699060","3705140"," take another long on Tesla you want to wait until you want to see what happens there so you should"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3705140","3711460"," be flat right now and what you would do is you would wait for regaining this one minute"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3711460","3718820"," and then take along with a stop underneath it and ride that pump again. You want to see it"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3718820","3724980"," regain the one minute right here. You want me to put it on Tesla I will. Where is that right now?"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3724980","3731220"," 145 62. You want to trade this at home real quick."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3735860","3744660"," You can probably to put Tesla on a that's right below it right now. This is a 27 EMA"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3745940","3749060"," and you want to see Tesla break above. Take this trade"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3749060","3757460"," for a second leg and you'd buy above here. This is where you'd buy it. Buy it and you put a"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3757460","3766580"," stop down below in case there's a liquidity break. Otherwise just hang out and if it ends up selling"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3766580","3771540"," down here to 144 we'll see what the reaction is in the five minute and see if there's another trade"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3771540","3785380"," here or not. We do have more sellers entering into the market at this point so be aware of that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3785380","3793860"," too. You have some profit taking going on right now and I don't like that we're at 240 we're not"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3793860","3800660"," above the trigger so this could be this could be starting to get weak. We'll keep an eye on it."
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3813300","3818740"," 146 41 Unreal why don't you let me know in the let me ask you guys let me ask you guys a question"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3818740","3828500"," in the chat and I'll see in the chat if you what your thoughts are on Tesla earnings"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3830340","3833860"," and I think you know it's funny we did it yesterday right where we talked about"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3834660","3844900"," how good our our polls are that our traders here tend to vote with not their feelings"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3845860","3853860"," but what they expect so we said we have a pretty high win rate I think yesterday's I think yesterday's"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3855940","3861380"," I think that yesterday's poll was does Microsoft dip and rip"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3863060","3867300"," and that's kind of what it did right after the bell we had a quick dip not big dip but a dip"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3867300","3872500"," but then we ripped and I think that's who won the poll yesterday so you guys you guys were right"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3873300","3878980"," we dipped and ripped close enough so we're going to ask again we're going to start a poll"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3879540","3883300"," and I'm going to ask you about Tesla ER what you think's going to happen"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3884420","3888500"," then I'll tell you what I think is going to happen Tesla ER"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3893540","3899140"," we'll get the results I'll leave it out for people as they roll in Tesla ER reaction"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3900020","3902020"," I want you to know that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3906020","3912260"," the thing about Tesla ER is you get the numbers and then you give a break until the guidance"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3912980","3918180"," so it could be a really weird thing so we're going to do it too we're going to give you a"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3918180","3921380"," we're going to give you a couple options or some different options than before"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3921860","3926820"," okay so the first option is going to be"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3928660","3934020"," um after the close so AC after close sell"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3937460","3940820"," buy open so BO up"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","3949940","3951620"," buy open flat"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3953700","3960500"," next next one would be after close up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3962020","3963940"," then buy open up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3966180","3968820"," and then after close sell"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3970820","3974100"," buy open bloodbath"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3974980","3981380"," blood let's try blood i'm going to ask community because this is going to be a kind of a weird one"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3982340","3987460"," this is going to be kind of a this is going to be kind of like a you're going to get two reactions"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3987460","3990980"," you're going to get the original reaction out after the bell and then you're going to get"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3992020","3997940"," uh something that impacts the open tomorrow so AC and BO is after close before open"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","3998660","4004900"," uh i'll just give you my my my view on it i think that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4006420","4014340"," i think that i think that um we're down after i think we after the close it's a sell"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4015220","4019300"," and then i think uh oh you know i didn't give this choice"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4019300","4024740"," shit i can't even add this choice i think after i think after the okay so this sucks"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4025700","4032500"," i kind of like this pull up if you don't answer this poll and think what i think is going to happen"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4032500","4038100"," just say uh i agree with captain so what i think happens is we sell the close"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4040340","4041940"," and then i think we open flat"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4043940","4048180"," um and then i think we go up after this"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","4072180","4078420"," monday i think tesla goes up again i think they burn down uh options from now until friday i think"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4078420","4085620"," we we were weak into the close uh maybe we're flat by open or whatever sell off there is is"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4085620","4091060"," recovered by open and then i think they don't pay put holders they don't pay call holders i think"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4091060","4095940"," that you then enter the trade like friday at the bell or something probably or end of the week at"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","4198260","4204180"," bulls must hold implied move right here so this is the implied move on tesla"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4206420","4212420"," uh as of right now they'll probably pin this here this this pretty much where the options market is"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4212420","4223300"," on tesla this s1 and s2 has to do with uh intraday like hourly and intraday support"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4224420","4231780"," and then if you get below uh the bulls must hold this is your daily um this is your true bullishness"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4231780","4237540"," of a reverse trend down here okay so bulls have some playroom down here heading into close"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4238100","4241540"," uh spy is holding its own up here"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4244980","4247460"," we'll uh look it's by above"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4251140","4254180"," looks like there's some room to breathe above on spy as well"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4257700","4261620"," uh for farther room up they're probably accounting for some kind of a move up here this implied"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4261620","4263220"," move it probably moves spy as well"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4263860","4267700"," we're going to move the uh support box here"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","4291860","4295540"," up now i'm going to end it only 44 votes i'm kind of surprised"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4297380","4300580"," i'm going to end the poll and we're going to take a look at the results tesla ear reaction"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4301780","4310580"," um so winky saying i think 155 to the upside is the max i want to wait to the downside uh tesla"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4310580","4318660"," i tried i like your opinion uh winky tesla ear reaction uh after close up by open up 28"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4319140","4324340"," no shit i disagree with that i think we have some people inside this uh i think we have some"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4324340","4330820"," people inside this i think we have infiltrators in the stream today i think we have infiltrators"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4330820","4335460"," in here how many of you have not tri maybe i should run a different poll and say how many of you"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4335460","4342340"," how many of you have traded an actual tesla ear as they tend they tend to they tend to follow a"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4342340","4348580"," certain script you tend to have like the move leading up the move the day of"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4350340","4357300"," and then most of the time good or bad news by open the next day man it's like flat"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4359540","4369620"," 26% of you said uh up sell uh 26% all right it's only 17% said sell bloodbath"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4370580","4373780"," yeah i don't think you're getting a bloodbath uh at this point maybe"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4375220","4379140"," maybe you get a bloodbath maybe they're accounting for that right the bloodbath what is a bloodbath"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4380660","4387060"," i'm i'm going to assume that this is not a bloodbath right 136 133 80 that's not a bloodbath"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4387620","4396740"," a bloodbath would have to be below 133 that's a bloodbath um that's what i would consider a bloodbath"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4397700","4401700"," if you got bears out there tomorrow and we open up down here i'm going to be like uh that's not good"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4401700","4407300"," enough you know if we open up like tomorrow down here that's not a bloodbath"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4411620","4417220"," uh but mostly most tesla ears unless they come out with my expectation on tesla is they're going to"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4417220","4424340"," have um they're the guidance will be mixed the report will be bad i think most of that stuff's"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4424340","4430100"," priced in they'd really have to come out with something ugly i hope that their guidance uh"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4430660","4435700"," ears dirty laundry in the beginning and then ends with hey a board i was concerned with the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4435700","4440580"," recession as we thought we once were we raised or we lowered our our price or our vehicles"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4441300","4447700"," and i don't think you're going to get continuation uh tomorrow higher unless there's some"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4447780","4455380"," announcement that nobody knows that's directly impactful to to tesla uh so if you're a bull"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4456180","4463940"," uh you're you're like most probable outcome is uh to wrap it up at some point and then reenter"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4464740","4473540"," um i would say end of week now you lose i guess if there's some announcement that's unknown"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4474260","4478900"," that directly impact something like yeah we're launching the truck tomorrow or something"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4478900","4484180"," we're filling orders tomorrow now we're filling orders in six months uh no none of the discussion"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4484180","4489300"," about an SUV none of that stuff i don't want to hear any of that crap you literally need like"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4489300","4494340"," we're splitting the stock or something you need something that's unknown it's actionable that it"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4494340","4500020"," needs to be priced in for the stock to immediately go up and hold there's like a function to that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4500100","4506180"," you need to have um you need to have new buyers for those calls right you need more people to buy"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4506180","4516340"," calls now for the stock to go up gonna quick squeeze here on spy and on uh tesla bear capitulation"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4516340","4525220"," baby bear capitulation bear capitulation happening right here that's what this is"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4525540","4532580"," just getting squozed let's see what you guys are saying in the uh"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4536100","4540900"," yeah like so it can't be anything that you know and it can't be anything that's down the road"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4541460","4546100"," i think the only thing you could say down the road would be in the guidance it would have to be"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4546100","4551060"," something like we've positioned ourselves like the one thing about microsoft was like"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4551620","4555620"," we're scared of the recession and we don't fucking know if we're ready for it that was bad"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4556740","4561300"," if you're like oh no no no no we got recession coming we don't fucking care we're ready to go"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4561300","4566980"," like that kind of a message is completely different"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4581700","4583700"," you"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4585140","4589220"," to be able to play after earnings uh from this morning drop and refill the gap that's bring"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4589220","4592340"," up spy yep exactly right Reiki Tom of Thompson"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4594900","4599060"," yeah you need to see i don't know what's business investment you like for just like good ER i think"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4599060","4604500"," you need to i think you need to hear something like it's like microsoft was bullish believe it or"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4604500","4609220"," not because microsoft is planning for the future you guys have to understand that like parse what"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4609220","4614740"," the words are being said the one negative that microsoft had was we've got a recession coming"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4614740","4622420"," we don't we think that could hurt us that's an important thing to know right but if tesla somehow"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4622420","4628180"," would have to you know some dumps and baggage and then say but we're positioned for a recession"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4628180","4634980"," that's like a key thing as we're positioned for a recession if you're positioned for a recession"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4635620","4640340"," uh you are you are way above a lot of other companies that are not positioned for a recession"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4644340","4647780"," yeah then i agree with that just some guys something like something the market doesn't"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4647780","4650100"," know about i've traded so many i've traded"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4651780","4659460"," uh i don't know 20 30 ERs like through ER i've traded them and usually it's something like"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4659460","4663940"," so usually even if it's a good ER you'll get a sell off if you've traded up into it"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4665140","4669940"," sell the news if you trade down into it it'll go higher but then by open the next day"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4670580","4675460"," you've got i mean the one microsoft is very similar to tesla you've got people that buy the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4675460","4680340"," underlying then they will try to take profit and reposition uh i'm telling you there's some"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4680340","4686420"," old school tesla bulls out there that know that if tesla cranks that they take the money on on the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4686420","4692980"," underlying and and they look for another reposition tesla bulls love buying the week after an earnings"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4692980","4698740"," season ask an ask a long time tesla bull they'll tell you uh now when i've helped through"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4699380","4704900"," a tesla earnings typically what'll happen is you'll see the ivy kick out on the calls the next"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4704900","4712180"," next day and even if the price goes up you're not going to get paid on those calls unless"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4714260","4720980"," unless there was some news uh in that ER that was unknown that was actionable then you'll see"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4721780","4728580"," uh the interest uh re-kick in on the opening bell you'll see a crank"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4733940","4734260"," yeah"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4739380","4743940"," yeah yeah so jan's saying the three-day rule i agree i agree with that um"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4751620","4757460"," you know tesla say maybe that microsoft info will be important the rest of market apparently not"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4757460","4762500"," that recession is not priced in yes it is you can't say it isn't you're trying to tell me the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4762500","4766340"," recession is priced i'm going to tell you what's not priced in i'm going to tell you what's not"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4766340","4770900"," priced in you guys don't you get fucking bears man i love you bears but you guys don't understand"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4771460","4778020"," the recession is priced in what's not priced in is a fed pause i can't believe the number of"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4778020","4784980"," bears that i see on on social media that claim that like the inversion like the the yield curve"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4784980","4790100"," inversion dude at winky tell them man like the yield invert like the yield curve inversion right"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4790100","4796180"," did you go back historically uh does not predict another leg down does not consistently predict"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4796180","4801460"," another leg down unemployment predicts another leg down and bears don't want to get this through"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4801460","4806820"," their fucking heads but you guys need to get your own charts out stop consuming shit on"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4807300","4815220"," fintuit stop fucking reading market watch and fucking cnbc like kick that shit to the ground"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4815220","4821860"," just go open up a chart look at when the fed pauses if you ever see the fed pause or cut rates"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4821860","4828500"," the market plummets every single time now the price that the market's at is not relevant"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4828500","4835780"," that's one key with when the pause comes and when the rates get cut the other key in that is if"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4835860","4841460"," the market believes the fed is fighting inflation it tends to stop going down and going sideways"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4841460","4847380"," and up until they pause or cut rates that did like like consistently and then the last part"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4847380","4851780"," that i would say on this is if you just bring up the yield inversion yield curve inversion right"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4851780","4856180"," it doesn't predict another leg down so the key point i'm trying to make to you is if you're a bear"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4856180","4860500"," out there please the love of everything out there if you're a bear out there please believe me please"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4860660","4866180"," believe me it is not the recession it hasn't been priced in it is the fucking pause"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4867060","4871620"," promise you promise you that at the moment they pause the moment that they cut rates"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4871620","4879380"," dude grab puts grab them all recession was priced in in may june the next leg down is more than likely"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4879380","4883460"," gonna be a fed rate pause you should be if you're very should be champion that you're like yeah"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4883460","4887620"," let's pause it i see bears i've been to it all day long they're like they say the craziest"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4887620","4892500"," shit to me right now i'm like they're like bulls are helping for a fed pause and as a matter"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4892500","4897700"," of fact if you're a bull and you think that a pause or a rate cut is gonna go make the market"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","4897700","4903300"," go up you're fucking crazy too you're like you're like you're gonna get smoked in that trade"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","5305380","5310820"," another leg down what do you need a hundred points for you should be able to get 600 or 800"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","5310820","5318340"," risk-free does that make sense is that like like logical and probable for like that major leg down"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","5319140","5327220"," do you need all 800 points uh or do you need 600 points you know what i mean if we end up"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","6809620","6814260"," i was always upside down with tesla"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6815140","6818900"," and then when i started looking at it like purely accumulation and distribution"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6818900","6822020"," i was like this is easy"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6822020","6828020"," not about the math yeah i used to be that kind of guy"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6828020","6831220"," i used to be the kind of guy that was like"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","6841860","6846260"," that's what i used to think um but then i always felt like i wasn't happy"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6846260","6849380"," being a tesla investor"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6849540","6854100"," i would be upside down in my uh holdings and stuff"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6856740","6860260"," tesla's a chart trade for you not a number"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6862420","6866420"," yeah the less the entire right less you know the better"

"YcYAIGBKSPE","6880660","6884820"," if you guys want to know what my views on the market on different time frames"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6884820","6890740"," uh or my my take on the market right now is that we trade sideways and up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6890740","6894500"," and we're waiting for unemployment to come up in a pause and fund rates"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6894500","6898420"," to uh get our get our last leg down"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6898420","6901940"," that's my that's my take on the market if you want to look at it from uh"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6901940","6907700"," small uh lower time frame uh we we're basically about to print a"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6907700","6913140"," cup and handle and if we hold that we don't start telling the market"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6913140","6917220"," uh we're looking at an inverse head and shoulders that prints"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6917220","6923060"," 460 that could take some time and if we trade sideways and up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6923060","6927540"," you might see a low in march april and then we trade it up through the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6927540","6931700"," summertime have another low in june or something june july or mostly more"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6931700","6934660"," one like the june they'll take another whack at it"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6934660","6939700"," to dump this market and pause rates or or um front run the pause or the"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6939700","6944660"," cutting of rates in september october and november"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6944660","6946980"," um"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6948420","6952100"," i think the worst trading plan that you can have in this market is uh it's"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6952100","6955300"," gonna implode on itself"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6955300","6959540"," like we're gonna have us uh a market collapse"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6959540","6965460"," i've traded those and even then it's usually better to take the long side"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6965460","6969620"," markets built for that i know that some people need to be bears or they trade"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6969620","6976100"," better as bears so i respect that 100 but for myself"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6976660","6980740"," i you know the other thing too it's weird is when we're in a bull market it's"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6980740","6983780"," easier to be a bear too"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6983940","6988260"," uh you you pretty much know every month that you're going to get um some"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6988260","6992100"," selling take a nice put position make some money"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6992100","6995460"," bulls take it back for a few weeks another sell off"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6995460","6999540"," it's pretty consistent money i don't think i know too many bears or bulls"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","6999540","7004580"," when the market is stable that don't make money if you think about this past"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7004580","7008660"," year the market stopped going back start going down"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7008660","7013620"," as like the market or if you think about this if you know the past three years"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7013620","7018820"," now the bear market began at the end of 2020 for a lot of speculative growth"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7018820","7024420"," stocks then you saw 2021 they came after any"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7024420","7029940"," stocks that weren't uh involved in uh corporate debt"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7029940","7036500"," bonds and then 2022 they came after the indexes"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7036500","7041380"," and most of the corporate debt bond companies like apples and that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7041380","7046420"," amazon's facebook and meta and all those companies"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7046420","7049620"," so this this bear market's been lasting for some time now"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7049620","7054740"," like to deny that that hasn't been going on since late 2020"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7054740","7058580"," is a farce right so it's been going on for some period of time i have"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7058580","7061700"," friends uh i have friends that you guys probably"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7061700","7064740"," know but you don't know that we're friends outside of this stuff"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7064740","7068260"," with like half million followers have conversations with them"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7068260","7072660"," and they talk about the same stuff these are bears and bulls"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7072660","7076740"," uh market hasn't really been going down since may"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7076740","7080420"," uh of this year so"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7080740","7084820"," it's not that it can't go down again or another leg down it's that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7084820","7087220"," um"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7087220","7090260"," think about how long you've been screaming bear like it's been since"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7090340","7093780"," may that's well how many months is that eight months now right"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7093780","7097860"," right the end of jan or the end of january eight months"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7097860","7101140"," eight months i know that i have bear friends that have gotten"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7101140","7105780"," dude i talk to people that uh DM me all the time that are bears and"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7105780","7109220"," they're i have bulls that contact and bears that contact me and they're like i"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7109220","7114580"," got fucked up since may i have a very close friend that got"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7114580","7118580"," destroyed in in may when we didn't continue down so"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7118580","7123140"," i think uh bulls and bears right now past eight months"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7123140","7126740"," like the idea of consistency whether we're going down or going up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7126740","7131140"," like this this seesaw market is tearing people up"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7131140","7133540"," and there's still not a lot of cash deployed in the market"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7133540","7136180"," that's the other thing about a bull market even if you're a bear think"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7136180","7140820"," about this if you're a bear if we're in a bear market i mean a bull market"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7140820","7145060"," and we start to sell off uh it's easier to be a bear in that market"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7145060","7148100"," than it is in this market this market's a very difficult"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7148100","7151540"," market for traders and investors i don't think that this market's been"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7151540","7155780"," easy on retailers in general you guys disagree with that"
"YcYAIGBKSPE","7155780","7161540"," statement anyway or am i uh am i misspeaking about this stuff"
