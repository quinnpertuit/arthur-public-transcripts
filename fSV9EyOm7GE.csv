"390670","399590"," optimistic That's never a good sign usually I will say that but I Would be optimistic"
"399590","409570"," ish here in the in the Short-term we're squeezing right up the"
"409570","417690"," bell right now We'll talk about that, but I'm saying get a little bit closer here We should be"
"417690","424770"," optimistic ish You know, there's a you go to a 30 minute chart really quick give me a quick second"
"424770","430010"," here So we had let's do a let's do a refresh of everything."
"430030","439390"," So last week number one last week I had calls earlier in the week calls fucking for Friday. "
"439390","440270"," I'm swearing again."
"440490","441510"," So I calls for Friday."
"441630","448270"," They'll get They opened getting torched And it got worse from there right the rest of the week. "
"448310","455090"," It just blasted down But we did some good we had some good Tickers we did good."
"455270","463130"," But last thing we did was about Tast right it was about taste that ticker did outstanding and we"
"463130","467850"," talked about Tesla and how is bearish on Tesla, right?"
"468490","473270"," And Tesla sold right so it has to sold off It was pretty ugly and then I was bullish on"
"473270","482610"," Netflix and I also said on Netflix I hope that it sells off into its Earnings report"
"482610","492430"," and to long it Into the report itself And what did it do so Tesla sold Taste what"
"492430","498770"," taste blast off that 115 or something like that Tesla did sell off and Netflix did go to the moon"
"498770","505090"," So all three of those picks worked out well So if you're focused on any of those three picks that"
"505090","511010"," we reviewed they turned out pretty good In another fascinating thing here is this I want to say"
"511010","519870"," something here because on I believe Monday or Tuesday I was very scared Matter of fact I was"
"519870","528390"," talking to Joe donut about my positioning because I have left on About eighty thousand dollars in"
"528390","534250"," the market not it's not a ton of money But it's about third to forty percent of what I had"
"534250","540210"," in the market Now my expectation for this year was to be up I'll be honest with you be up"
"540210","545410"," like five hundred thousand dollars a share half million That was my projections for end of year."
"545510","551490"," That's a walk away with And I'd be a pretty happy fucking guy end up selling all my risk on"
"551490","558730"," shit all the spectro stuff You name that stuff the only stuff that I kept or kept buying and"
"558730","569650"," holding was DIA shit like Tyson foods Verizon Companies"
"569650","579230"," like that right Visa like Visa did fine but what's really bizarre is Where I bought those tickers"
"579230","589050"," are fine Even right now they're fine so I Would have to say about that is"
"589830","595630"," I'm scratching my head here because my only real exposure in the market is actually up right now"
"595630","600390"," Generally speaking is up even with the market down where it is right now It's actually up from"
"600390","605410"," where I originally bought all this shit like Budweiser All those tickers are up. "
"605690","612390"," So I'm left kind of befuddled here as to what to do And I'm going to talk to you about"
"612390","618770"," today because I I was talked to Talk to a friend and I talked to Joe about it Early in"
"618770","627230"," the earlier last week It was Monday or Tuesday or something And his point to me was yields right"
"627230","635710"," and you know, we'll look at we'll try to look at yields see if I can because Yields don't always"
"635710","641930"," matter and So we'll talk about yields when they do and don't matter you guys are all signing And I"
"641930","646390"," have friends that are like, it's all yields man, and I'm like I'm like and kind of believe that I"
"646390","651530"," kind of don't It's that was the fucking case at all yields all fucking day long."
"651530","654590"," So Doesn't really do it for me."
"654850","658230"," We'll talk about yields in how they do matter But they don't always matter. "
"658450","662890"," We'll look at the actual when they do and don't and why and all that other kind of stuff Anyways"
"662890","672370"," for myself, I don't know what to do here I Didn't know what to do last week and All those"
"672370","679150"," tickers were they were way green then they were down and now they're greenish Green I'm not read in"
"679150","680490"," any of these like there's a cumulative."
"680850","683450"," I'm not read so I Don't know what to do here."
"683530","684110"," This is stuff. "
"684330","688410"," This is the other crazy thing Do you guys know me long if you guys have known me long enough?"
"691270","699050"," I'm a I'm a serial cell to early kind of guy and I wind up kicking myself over this years"
"699050","704270"," later and these tickers why I didn't sell them originally was because I wanted to hold them for my"
"704270","709830"," kids For five to ten years and one of the questions that I had about these tickers that I own"
"709830","718430"," is Will they participate with a crash and a lot of these tickers are in the like dumpster like"
"718430","725910"," they're down like 10 15 year lows Stuff like that and they didn't participate this past couple"
"725910","735010"," weeks and then they really participated so I Don't know personally here what I'm going to do I was"
"735010","737290"," quite panicky earlier last week as the week progressed."
"737690","742010"," I got less panicky on that stuff And I was actually up on the week But not due to my"
"742010","746350"," fucking trading of options So I had some good training options early in the week had a couple"
"746350","750150"," losses better than a big loss In the middle of last week."
"750850","751830"," So that was kind of tough. "
"752050","758870"," We'll take a look right now at There's special Bob saying that Bob saying that he's not Positive"
"758870","768800"," about here and we'll take a look at the trigger screen really quick and The"
"768800","773800"," one thing I want to say about the triggers is we still have not broken the monthly triggers They're"
"773800","779940"," still bullish still positive We haven't broken through but there is a danger here and that danger"
"779940","787920"," here is the daily trigger about to cross this weekly trigger and It becomes quite violent."
"788360","796320"," The moves down can become very violent and And not be good for the market They become we become"
"796320","804200"," very volatile as well Where you'll start to we begin to see violent swings In here and if we begin"
"804200","808500"," to trade underneath this monthly trigger Things are going to get really nasty."
"809020","816080"," So number one Where we are right now, you're going to expect a lot of volatility This failure that"
"816080","822700"," took place last week was bad news This was I believe back on Wednesday, right somewhere in here. "
"822820","828980"," There's where it began Back on Tuesday and then into Wednesday and this cell signal right here on"
"828980","836020"," This rejection right right back here This push-up right here on Thursday and then the immediate"
"836020","841600"," cell on the cross of the hourly and the weekly was a no-go Right right blast all the way"
"841600","848080"," down come back down to the previous low that we had back here Get a new low here signaling more"
"848080","854880"," downside to come we can get an extension down here, too But I'm going to expect a bounce down here"
"854880","860100"," We're going to talk about this here and implications that take place in here So we've got a target"
"860100","869680"," down below of 410 35 okay 410 35 Defit the the 1.38 fib or something like that is down"
"869680","878280"," here at like 4 15 or you may be on 17 down here, but The point one one 168 is"
"878280","879120"," somewhere even lower."
"879280","886340"," It's like this 410 35 or something like that But we're going to go back and look at Some previous"
"886340","894080"," examples of what happens here when we get these crosses and how violent they can become And as we"
"894080","898200"," get that confirmation of the cross of the daily over the weekly, it's it's very bad, right?"
"898480","906100"," We're going to look back at an example of it and when this happens What's what what traders end up"
"906100","906820"," doing, okay?"
"906820","910800"," And I'm going to show you a couple of these here."
"911100","913180"," So Here's a big one right here. "
"913260","920200"," So you got a big push down in price this one recovered and went higher and the daily recovered But"
"920200","924900"," regardless this isn't the point that I'm making to the point is that's even though we went down in"
"924900","931580"," bloodbath we squeeze back up so If you were looking for if you were looking for a if you're a"
"931580","937480"," bull and you're looking for a place to sell This probably is not it and my positioning in the"
"937480","943870"," market probably isn't it either so any kind of panic that I have and holding these tickers is"
"945680","955300"," unwarranted now this is This is a January of point 22 and there's a cross right here, too And I"
"955300","956200"," want to show you that too."
"956400","957800"," So you think to yourself."
"958280","962520"," Hey, I'm in a panic mode, right and sell All right, I was up here. "
"962640","968120"," Everything was fine markets going up everything's awesome sauce And you panic and down here, right?"
"968820","974100"," And you finally get that cross right here and you'll fall on panic and you were still given an"
"974100","979720"," opportunity now the other Example I showed you we continued to go higher But you were still given"
"979720","984140"," an opportunity to exit the market in orderly fashion back here and the other example I showed you"
"984140","991220"," was the same example and that was the example being that this is not the place to panic Okay, so"
"991220","998060"," so I'm just showed you two examples of whenever we're down here don't start panicking and They're"
"998060","1002840"," likely going to get a squeeze even if we if we continue to sell so we're gonna go back over"
"1002840","1012440"," here and and show this right now where we are and You're gonna at least expect any any"
"1012440","1018960"," continuation or extension of the downside no matter what is going to result in some kind of a"
"1020480","1028040"," Squeeze higher so if you're caught in here right now if you're a bull And you're caught in here and"
"1030500","1038859"," you're expecting, you know a crash that doesn't recover I Would tell you that that that's highly"
"1038859","1045200"," highly unlikely Extreme and likelihood of like you never come back to this or it's it's gonna last"
"1045200","1051560"," longer than a week or two weeks or something like that So I would temper yourself and further"
"1051560","1052780"," further that point."
"1052920","1061400"," I would temper yourself to say at least Whenever that squeeze happens here that you look for an"
"1061400","1068860"," opportunity to exit the market and start to reconsider Reentering in February or April or whatever"
"1068860","1069460"," next year."
"1069880","1075640"," So at your most emotional Moment of the market where you're like hey, everybody's gonna get a panic"
"1075640","1081500"," here creeped out or freaked out or whatever Uh, everything is doom and gloom and as a matter of"
"1081500","1085780"," fact you can see here in the 30 minute Daily hair now. "
"1085800","1087260"," We're not quite at the bottom here, right?"
"1088360","1093800"," But you should see some kind of a push up coming up here very shortly or at minus 33 right"
"1093800","1101420"," now in the daily velocity, but Even if it's minus 50 you're still gonna see a swing back high up"
"1101420","1102120"," here at some point."
"1102240","1102700"," Does that make sense?"
"1103300","1107960"," So I wouldn't be panicking right now if I was a bull now Can you get long here would be"
"1107960","1113760"," the next question and we already know that you can't get long unless you get above the one in five"
"1113760","1123410"," minutes and Preferably above the hourly trigger to so let's get to a Let's get to"
"1123410","1129210"," an hourly chart here, right and you can see that we're just selling off this hourly, right boom"
"1129870","1136510"," selling off the half hour the half hour here and And so unless we let me show it to you"
"1136510","1137710"," real real simply here, okay?"
"1138650","1147300"," Unless you start to see price Begin to reverse to the upside here, right?"
"1148440","1154700"," That would also mean the one of the five minutes underneath you and That you're above this hourly"
"1154700","1155640"," trigger here, right?"
"1156720","1162300"," And you can get a three trigger cluster going for yourself You have the white and the red"
"1162300","1170930"," underneath you here Or anything just like that Something like that, right?"
"1171150","1176310"," You can't even take the long there's no point in taking the long But when you see if you see"
"1176310","1181070"," this or whenever you see this we can get it long take it up here and Wait for the rejection"
"1181070","1184250"," on the daily and the and the weekly trigger, okay?"
"1185150","1190510"," Or we get catch the bounce off of this monthly down here see it right down here Catch the bounce"
"1190510","1195430"," down off this We probably trade that right there up to the half hour of the hour and then we'll"
"1195430","1200390"," look for that hourly up to the daily trigger So don't don't get too crazy panicky in here."
"1200510","1201450"," I'm long this market. "
"1201690","1206310"," I got a lot of money In stock here that I don't think for me."
"1206530","1211150"," This is the place for the bank nor was it up here And if anything I'm gonna wait for that"
"1211950","1216710"," Squeeze to go higher to to at least exit the market in an orderly fashion and then try to re "
"1216710","1225610","-enter it in In the springtime or late late winter spring start to look for some entry So I don't"
"1225610","1233450"," know what Bob is saying The run is likely over for the year but Even no matter what bloodbath that"
"1233450","1238830"," is here You're likely going to see some kind of a squeeze to the upside high volatility negative"
"1238830","1245310"," and positive and you'll likely be afforded An exit and that's that's what I'm looking for right"
"1245310","1249910"," now, so Some kind of an exit hold on one second here."
"1249930","1266120"," I'm gonna bring this stuff up for you I'll put some some s2 over here for you You"
"1266120","1289980"," know one quick second here One"
"1289980","1299540"," quick second here And we'll look at the we'll look at the 10 year we'll look at the gilts today"
"1299540","1305380"," to we're gonna look at the Is it Great Britain 30 years something like that?"
"1305980","1315270"," We'll take a look at that as well and Think hold on let's sit now We got a lot to"
"1315270","1316230"," go over my god. "
"1316330","1326150"," Whatever dude, whatever You like one thing that sucks about streaming is It doesn't"
"1326150","1335790"," suck it's just there you constantly I'm gonna bring this up for you right now, okay And just"
"1335790","1342750"," intraday stuff right you get the the prices underneath the one and five minute trigger Right catch"
"1342750","1349640"," on a nice bounce right now Bring this over here make this larger."
"1349960","1360500"," Hold on here There's"
"1360500","1379420"," s1 there's s2 We'll"

"1427060","1427720"," one quick second."
"1427780","1446400"," I want to make sure this looks Yeah,"
"1449520","1454600"," there's a lot going on right so miss talking monkey just said What you're feeling now seems to be"
"1454600","1459760"," what Bob is feeling there's a lot of mechanics going on in the background It's hard to pin it on"
"1461640","1468560"," It's hot for me personally, I don't ascribe to hey, it's The inverted yield curve. "
"1469000","1475900"," It's the 10 year yield as a matter of fact Joe done it was like you should put in your"
"1475900","1481660"," your shit in the bond so for the retailers now This money's exiting the market and I already get"
"1481660","1490940"," five points something from my money market accounts, so I had my broker my broker gives me over"
"1490940","1500400"," five right now, so I don't need to Put money there the other argument that came out too was Why"
"1500400","1505780"," not get a clean easy five percent or six percent and you could get a clean easy five or six"
"1505780","1514320"," percent for the past Six months to a year and it to be odd it's weird early so early this"
"1514320","1515600"," week or last week, right?"
"1517400","1519120"," I own houses."
"1519640","1526200"," I went and changed I said I did like the winterization of these houses that's turning off the water"
"1526200","1531780"," to the spigots outside changing the furnace filters that kind of stuff and That's a nice clean"
"1531780","1538540"," bounce right here, so Why would I do why would I do that I went to I went to an"
"1538540","1544300"," auction for my county here just Matter of fact, it's a fucking process."
"1544580","1549360"," I had a drive around look at houses For it doesn't anymore start actually start by look at the list"
"1549360","1554720"," then I map it all out Then I go look at these houses in person Then I formulate a list"
"1554720","1565660"," that we had nice fat squeeze right now all the way back to the opening price here so I Would"
"1565660","1566560"," put my money there. "
"1566840","1572700"," I would just buy houses I will always get a better ROI on a house than I will ever get"
"1572700","1579640"," at five or six percent As a matter of fact, most people that I know they're do what I do"
"1580640","1589600"," They want out of the residential Real estate market if they're making less than 10 So most of these"
"1589600","1598500"," guys are making 20 sometimes 30 On real estate so for me at least I don't see that as an"
"1598500","1604340"," avenue That I want to move money to and there's this argument out there that that is where all the"
"1604340","1610740"," money is going Which but that avenue was open a year ago I mean I want to say it was"
"1610740","1615600"," six months ago, but it was like a fucking year ago And I have money that's making money that way"
"1615600","1618880"," so I don't need bonds to Do that."
"1619040","1620420"," I don't see how that's the option."
"1620620","1627200"," It's being spoon fed to a lot of people and I showed you a chart For the past few weeks"
"1627200","1632680"," right I showed you a chart where I believe it was Mike Wilson gave a target of five percent on"
"1632680","1639040"," ten year yields and I think GS said there should be a sideways action, then we'll get the five"
"1639040","1645880"," percent So now you have a cacophony of people saying yeah, you're like yields, whoo And I'm like"
"1645880","1653220"," when you hear these cacophonies I go I start to hesitate, you know When yields were at one There"
"1653220","1659640"," was no scream for that right so And we that is actually we could we can we actually look at"
"1659640","1663660"," the ten year yield real quick And you can see that there should be some supply there. "
"1663720","1673320"," We'll look at the yields real quick a quick second I Don't know where I put the yields."
"1673780","1688260"," Let's take a look at the yields maybe it's on this one I don't"
"1688260","1695800"," know if I did it on this chart Here we go So you guys remember this chart right here, I"
"1695800","1703430"," showed you guys this chart It's a while ago, right You remember this chart?"
"1705450","1709490"," And we can watch it right now and see how it's gone up, right?"
"1709690","1715190"," We missed this one right here, but then we bounced Goldman Sachs said sideways, so let's we'll say"
"1715190","1718650"," that Bill Ackman and Larry Think we're both right, right?"
"1719170","1721090"," So Goldman said sideways."
"1721410","1728610"," We got the sideways action and then Larry Fink Bill Ackman said 5% And that's where it should start"
"1728610","1730810"," to level out right up here, right?"
"1731670","1740130"," And you guys before that we even got here I charted this out for you now We know that there's"
"1740130","1744790"," supply back here if you want to look at a higher time frame I think I got a little weekly"
"1744790","1758480"," to show it, but I can go to a weekly, maybe a week lower show up better So"
"1758480","1760440"," just So right here, right?"
"1760600","1761560"," This is where we are with yields. "
"1761880","1766920"," See that see this dotted line right here And this dotted line we sold off these in the past."
"1767100","1767920"," You see that right there."
"1768040","1773920"," There is there is supply here And can we go higher kit?"
"1774100","1780340"," Yes, we can we can definitely go higher We can definitely go higher six and a half seven is that"
"1780340","1786800"," a nice ring to it But for right now, the other thing to look at here is be looking at"
"1787700","1788140"," Guilts. "
"1788760","1792540"," Guilts are important because they're especially the 30-year guilt is just blasting off right now"
"1793660","1797300"," Now you can see yields blasting to the downside today, right?"
"1797460","1802260"," This is a one-minute chart on yields coming down We want to see a break of that trend though,"
"1802380","1802760"," don't we?"
"1803540","1810400"," If we're gonna get that continuation to an upside move And at least right now you're seeing you're"
"1810400","1812400"," seeing spoos squeeze right now, right?"
"1812940","1822200"," You're gonna expect yields to come back down 486 at least What you really want here is this break"
"1822200","1828620"," of trends that bounce back here in this trend And then the rejection the downside move And truly"
"1828620","1835180"," want to be breaking below that 4.64 So you want to see I'll put this in for you right"
"1835180","1842620"," now I guess if you think it's just yields Uh, we'll do something like that there You know what what"
"1842620","1851600"," a bull wants to see is something at least like that Something at least like that so If you think"
"1851600","1858360"," yields is it Hold on a second here The spy just keeps keeps cranking right now, right?"
"1861700","1912500"," It's a 30 minutes go to a one minute Looks"
"1912500","1925140"," terrible Upside"
"1925140","1936040"," target uh 4 20 93 Then"
"1936040","1945820"," we have 423 13 Yeah, yeah, like like I'm like I can pull in my net whatever"
"1945820","1949780"," I want like I I'm not really buying I'm not really buying it right now."
"1949940","1955520"," So if this lines up with a Bob saying I would trust him so the idea here would be Uh,"
"1956960","1960420"," we're gonna look at a couple of it We'll look at a few other things too We'll look at the"
"1960420","1966680"," inverted yield curve and see when it matters when it doesn't it doesn't matter About 30 to 40"
"1966680","1971660"," percent of the time And that's enough for me to never like yeah, does it fall online?"
"1972040","1975640"," Fuck yeah, it does like 60 70 percent Is it 100 percent of time?"
"1976140","1978920"," No, it isn't So we'll talk about that."
"1979140","1987460"," We'll talk about rate increases We have that so much stuff talk about Uh, we're also talk about Uh,"
"1987780","1988980"," the JPM caller. "
"1989200","1992580"," We're gonna talk also talk about Uh, seasonality."
"1992880","1993480"," We'll talk about that too."
"1993560","2000080"," We'll uh, touch on that again today Then we'll talk about uh reinvesting in the market when to do"
"2000080","2006980"," that usually Now we usually have a low in February and then the real buying kicks in in uh, April"
"2007560","2015860"," Uh, every year so The buying for the year is likely done and the continue uh, matter of fact, uh,"
"2015880","2023000"," david ams talked about continuation or in or Lots of distribution into end of year. "
"2023140","2030220"," That's that's highly likely side or get sideways down and then Uh, a real bloodbath into the late"
"2030220","2040120"," winter and springtime Squeezing up right now to the half hour trigger See it right"
"2040120","2047620"," there Watch out for a rejection here."
"2047739","2049040"," You want to see a touch bat."
"2049139","2054600"," Well, I guess we had a touch back right here Uh, but wouldn't hesitate to see a reversal right here"
"2054600","2056920"," and then Take that thing higher. "
"2057500","2058500"," We can break through this."
"2058679","2063159"," This is where people have been selling so Whatever you do here if you're gonna trade day trade this"
"2063159","2068820"," do not uh, do not trade do not be long here All right, you can be long here, but see"
"2068820","2081130"," the cross right here You can get long again above here Uh for the next trade to 421 15 Let's"
"2081130","2084730"," take a look at the gamma picture as well at some points I'm missing a braille this stuff down."
"2084909","2088830"," She's saying I gotta get I gotta get so I got so much stuff to go over Hold on here"
"2090489","2101510"," So we're gonna do the yield curve So we're gonna do a gamma We're gonna do jpm collar What"
"2101510","2114190"," else we're gonna do today Whole bunch of earnings we have to go over You know better new book Mind"
"2114190","2117310"," the bear bus yet, uh, no, I'm not. "
"2117670","2121250"," I'm still not on the bear bus I just talked about it."

"2131050","2132570"," I am not on the bull bus for sure."
"2132710","2142050"," I'm more on this like neutral Garbage for until spring until late winter or spring now No, that's"
"2142050","2142370"," about it."
"2142470","2143850"," But am I in the bear bus the crash bus?"
"2144150","2144430"," Fuck. "
"2144710","2144810"," No."
"2145330","2146470"," I'm not with crash gang."
"2146710","2154790"," So Uh, I'm assuming that you guys all are I'm assuming I wasn't on I wasn't on the uh stock"
"2154790","2163270"," market the past uh week half week So I haven't been consuming whatever you've been consuming"
"2163270","2166550"," whatever been drinking out there I haven't been drinking it. "
"2166550","2167230"," I've been having a blast."
"2167450","2174450"," I've been partying getting drunk hanging out with friends hanging out with family too and uh Having"
"2174450","2176610"," a grand old town get a lot of a lot of time away."
"2176830","2184850"," So I spent this time trying not to or trying to step step away from the market Uh and not"
"2184850","2191150"," be like grossly consumed by it And I know a lot of you are I know that I get like"
"2191150","2191350"," that. "
"2191690","2198830"," I am usually I'm eating eating and drinking this market 24 hours a day I lose sleep."
"2199030","2206830"," I lose uh friendships and families and all that kind of stuff over being constantly consumed year"
"2206830","2213790"," in year out and I have to step away for like five fucking minutes every once in a while mostly"
"2213790","2216810"," uh When when it's like this, I'm a bull."
"2217030","2221810"," So when we're when we're not doing well And it's not this was planned, but I don't know why this"
"2221810","2229790"," was planned with this much bearish and this was past week but Um, uh, you know, it doesn't really"
"2229790","2234250"," matter So what it does matter is that I still need that time away You should all if you're not"
"2234250","2241590"," I want you to know something if you Are if this consumes you you have to step away for a"
"2241590","2247150"," week You have to like take a break Um, so no, I'm not on bear bus. "
"2247650","2254550"," I'm not on crash bus Uh, and if we do crash I just showed you two examples of us not"
"2254550","2255090"," one example."
"2255330","2261030"," It's not crashing another example of us crashing So even when we crash unless we have something"
"2261030","2268390"," like covid Uh or 1987 I heard that bandied about the past week or two Three weeks unless we have"
"2268390","2275370"," and you know, it's weird because 1987 It was an actual glitch It was it was in my view."
"2275570","2276090"," That's what it was. "
"2276330","2281570"," So I know it's being assigned to a bunch of stuff that it wasn't Right now, uh, but it was"
"2281570","2288390"," it was it was computing And, um, that's not happening not like that and not not under those same"
"2288390","2296150"," circumstances These are not the same circumstances as 1987 Uh, you should never, uh, assign"
"2296150","2302070"," historical Like hey, this happened 1987 Uh, we're in the same predicament right now."
"2302190","2302550"," Fuck."
"2302910","2307530"," No Uh, I don't know what kind of historians you are of the stock market. "
"2307830","2313450"," I go back like I spend time looking at world war two I spend time looking at the great depression."
"2313770","2321570"," I spend time looking in at the 1890s Uh, and not not a like nothing's ever the exact same so"
"2322210","2328490"," Uh, and nothing is the same even trading today is not the same as it was Um, I'm back then"
"2328490","2333690"," even covid should have taught you that right You saw you remember we would hit stop limits remember"
"2333690","2338830"," that shut the market down on us We do have limit down stop right then we go blast back up"
"2338830","2347050"," Uh, so like I would I would shy away from that Um And if we get a crash You're likely"
"2347050","2352010"," going to see it here soon and I just showed you 15 minutes ago."
"2352030","2358790"," I just showed you an example of the volatility when We are where we are I showed you that even"
"2358790","2365390"," when we are this volatile You're likely going to see monster moves even to the upside So even if"
"2365390","2370930"," you are in crash mode or hey, I'm bearish air I gotta tell you guys something there are people in"
"2370930","2371430"," this stream. "
"2371570","2378870"," Okay There are people in the stream that have brought up to me said to me said to me specifically"
"2380030","2389070"," that uh, they sold In that in that January 22 2022 role They sold and then watched it come all"
"2389070","2394330"," the way back up again And they had an orderly exit available and they lost a lot of money by"
"2394330","2402690"," not being patient Um to let the market show them where we are where we are headed So the only"
"2402690","2407830"," thing I would say to you the only thing that I could leave you with at this moment is Direction"
"2407830","2414490"," unclear Mostly just direction unclear if you see let me see what bring this back to a 30 minute"
"2414490","2425510"," chart here If"
"2425510","2440840"," you wind up seeing if you"
"2440840","2447420"," wind up seeing some kind of a rejection here Right some major rejection Right."
"2448160","2454080"," Yeah, I'd be getting scared right You might be like yeah, we could crash this right Let me draw"
"2454080","2454260"," this."
"2454360","2455180"," Let me draw that better. "
"2455700","2460660"," So I'm just gonna draw that better So let's say you go to keep going down here, right?"
"2460780","2462340"," But we squeeze back up here, right?"
"2464420","2465580"," And that's it, right?"
"2465860","2469100"," We're now gonna break underneath And start dropping."
"2469340","2479300"," I'm assuming that some of you think That we break down below this Right and"
"2479300","2483560"," then this stuff starts to come down on top of it That's just like that that's not how the market"
"2483560","2483780"," works."
"2484000","2489040"," I'm sorry Just it's just not how the market works and even in even in covet. "
"2489100","2492260"," It didn't work like that I don't know if you were trading covet or not."
"2492420","2493740"," I tried covet from the fucking moment."
"2493940","2502160"," It was going on Right through it and we had monster monster squeezes Squeezes that dude. "
"2502420","2505100"," These are like Puts that were like 20 30."
"2505300","2512900"," I like puts are like 20 30 40 dollars That were back down to like like five bucks four dollars"
"2513500","2519300"," Um, so just be it You know, so the idea here would be this is that you should have an"
"2519300","2525420"," you should have an opportunity that minimum Whether we go here or not you should have an"
"2525420","2531860"," opportunity to exit orderly here And then wait and see what happens Right till we get the"
"2531860","2537880"," continuation of the upside to get bullish again Even if it's only for the week or the month or the"
"2537880","2542740"," quarter or whatever it is Uh, or you exit here and we roll back down and you can get all"
"2542740","2550040"," bear gang and you know crash gang and all that kind of stuff You know I got to tell you"
"2550040","2550180"," guys."
"2550340","2551140"," I got to tell you guys. "
"2551360","2555920"," I'm so I just read something this morning that said And this is fascinating a lot of my holdings"
"2555920","2563600"," the stuff that I do hold right now Uh, they're having great reports My tickers every report is is"
"2563600","2573240"," boom 73% of earnings are beating Uh, they're estimates and my holdings right now are are just"
"2573240","2581960"," knocking out of the ballpark So I don't want to say to you here in this, um I would I"
"2581960","2591940"," would need to see I would need to see something like Well I don't know what i'm going"
"2591940","2596300"," to do I don't know what i'm going to do when we do squeeze up here."
"2596340","2599900"," I don't know what i'm going to do I'm going to I'm going to look at my holdings and say"
"2599900","2605840"," yeah, do I just exit and try to re-enter in February and April Uh, so I don't have to"
"2605840","2614200"," deal with that potential crash over here So Yeah, I don't know where i'm at right now."
"2614280","2619100"," I know one thing that i'm at right now I know for a fucking fact that if we go down"
"2619100","2625840"," here this week Right, I'm definitely not selling Uh, because I see that that's still let's see that"
"2625840","2632600"," huge squeeze that monster squeeze for me to get out up here So if you're a bull I would say"
"2632600","2637540"," that you have to be very patient here and we still haven't had a cross here So we don't have"
"2637540","2644140"," a cross on the weekly and daily Uh, although it's it's it's pretty much there. "
"2644380","2650460"," We have not had it yet and uh We have not had the cross on spx."
"2650680","2656100"," We have not had the cross on es We have had the cross on di a But I was buying"
"2656100","2660340"," that stuff when we had that cross that's what i was buying like, but why is there all that stuff"
"2660340","2665040"," We had we did have a daily over weekly cross, but that was that was like a months ago."
"2665140","2673780"," So I don't know um as a matter of fact tech has not Isn't even near crossing um S&P"
"2673780","2680200"," 500 is near crossing, but uh Nasdaq is not Nasdaq is not anywhere near them. "
"2680300","2692010"," You can show you guys uh Nasdaq really quick And"
"2692010","2693250"," there has been no cross here."
"2693410","2697830"," So here's the 30 minute chart on nq We have a break of the weekly here, but no cross of"
"2697830","2699010"," the daily over weekly here."
"2699170","2704770"," So still not happening Give a bunch of good reports coming out a bunch of big reports this week"
"2704770","2714650"," next week 70 percent 75 of those companies beat and Uh I don't know do we"
"2714650","2716810"," well the one thing at the other is weird. "
"2717210","2721730"," I will say this We'll put a caveat on what i'm my statements here."
"2722110","2728470"," I got to say this because uh when we were looking at banks reporting I gave you guys a bunch"
"2728470","2736750"," of predictions for those banks and I said to you the one thing that was scratching my head on Was"
"2736750","2740650"," it looked like most of them i was like, yeah that most of them seem like they're gonna uh print"
"2741190","2746870"," And most of them did print But it looked like take the money and run and sure enough they took"
"2746870","2753890"," the money and ran on any of those good reports Uh, so that could play out I'm not anti the"
"2753890","2760250"," markets selling down and off even though these we get good reports and individual tickers go up So"
"2760250","2761190"," I got it."
"2761290","2770940"," I should put that caveat in there uh because uh at least financials were showing that Uh"

"6024460","6026200"," of you guys haven't been here since earlier. "
"6026360","6029740"," So this is um The right chart."

"6036400","6043890"," Absolutely So just take a look at this here."
"6044350","6048750"," This is the Uh, monthly trigger down below here. "
"6048830","6063100"," See this monthly trigger down here for 10 35 on spy Uh, it'll be different than spx and spx"
"6063100","6075280"," and um And bring this over here for you I'll show you that right there So"
"6075280","6081420"," let's take a look at that right there So we're still on a downward channel here, right you see that"
"6081420","6084320"," channel It's still in this downward channel here."
"6084420","6088480"," There's nothing to say we're still not in that downward channel So as you come up into the hourly"
"6088480","6090360"," trigger, you should not be long should you?"
"6091460","6093960"," And can we break straight down to the depths of hell here?"
"6094140","6106960"," I'm so fucking lily so Maybe I can draw this one You"
"6106960","6116910"," can easily stay on trend here right Up to the hourly trigger and then come down and slam into"
"6116910","6126810"," that monthly before before a big big squeeze uh, now If we get"
"6126810","6134370"," above the hourly trigger See right here how we got up to it Up to the hourly trigger and then"
"6134370","6137390"," immediately reject it down You don't want to get caught in that, right?"
"6138410","6142930"," So if we do break above the hourly trigger, you need the one in five minutes to come underneath and"
"6142930","6150070"," carry us here Uh to find out what's going to happen The big question mark is does the daily"
"6150070","6151210"," rejecting come down?"
"6154480","6159560"," So yeah, so just the stand trend here You can see that or if you can see that the red"
"6159560","6163660"," line right there That's downward trend."
"6164260","6170360"," No, we got to get above that We're going to make our way up here Yeah, so do I think"
"6170360","6171480"," there could be another move down?"
"6171700","6172680"," I'm so fucking lily. "
"6172880","6185470"," So let's go to a one minute chart I"
"6185470","6193690"," wouldn't particularly be caught dead long Like you get out long right there You let price come"
"6193690","6195730"," above and you do what you always do, right?"
"6196850","6198710"," You wait for the one minute here else."

"6201990","6229290"," You clean it up for you Get rid of it Now"
"6229290","6233690"," hourly trend is on your side here Well, you don't want to see is you don't want to see a"
"6233690","6234290"," roll, right?"
"6235150","6239730"," You don't want to see a rejection You don't want to see that right you don't want to see that"
"6240810","6251870"," You don't want to see the break above This kind of nonsense and then back down do you You"
"6251870","6255830"," don't want to see that right you don't want to see us come up rejecting down you want to take"
"6255830","6264630"," the money and run You don't want to see a squeeze up here putter out and then reverse the downside,"
"6264830","6265190"," right?"
"6265670","6269590"," Hourly says it's on your side right now But you don't want to see that right you're gonna get"
"6269590","6275830"," caught in any of this The next thing that you're looking for though if you are bullish Or if you're"
"6275830","6287020"," like, hey, we're gonna get another low What you don't want to see is price Squeeze up Right"
"6287020","6295080"," and then have that have that red come up And that white come up and help out, right?"
"6298160","6304400"," If you see that and the reject and the bounce is good if the pullback is good We'll take that"
"6304400","6309800"," up and start trading the upside move and we'll call it done If you are a bear and you've got"
"6309800","6314720"," shorts in the market and you see us begin to trade higher I'll let you know. "
"6315160","6324440"," I'll say something to you if you should close your shorts out or somewhere up in here See the 30"
"6324440","6334000"," minute check below in the hourly Yeah, daily looks like it has more down to go It looks like"

"13356100","13365940"," we get it, but i'm looking right now at Now if you're"
"13365940","13371040"," following along in your office or at home or wherever it is you are out there Open up a spy"
"13371040","13380960"," right now, okay And overload options chain right now spy And they're claiming Uh, the dealers are"
"13380960","13391900"," claiming hey, we're not going up there so Now Four"
"13391900","13393340"," 30s aren't even registering there. "
"13393460","13408420"," There's zero there worth zero right now So"
"13408420","13416960"," there is some thought here For you of some consolidation in here rather than a big squeeze so if"
"13416960","13420080"," i'm looking at this right I'm looking at this."
"13420440","13430320"," Uh, I would tell you That after this big squeeze we just had I I would say well,"
"13430480","13437060"," there's a there's a chance of a major squeeze right it's like straight north We just trade for 30"
"13437060","13441700"," like it's nobody's business And that sounds crazy to you probably like no there ain't no way that's"
"13441700","13449380"," happening in today cap Uh, and I don't think that it is either so Uh, we're above the hourly"
"13449380","13459340"," trigger right now, right Um We have another resistance point to the upside It's uh, 424.99"
"13475420","13484800"," This is r1 Uh dealers are saying yeah, that's possible Now we could go all the way up there today,"
"13484900","13485060"," believe it."
"13485240","13487700"," I know you guys are like, there ain't no way we're going up there I don't think we are either"
"13488380","13498260"," But this doesn't seem too irrational And you can actually already see"
"13500660","13506600"," Maybe a pit focus on this right here And you can see where the where this little top is right"
"13506600","13513800"," here corresponds with the previous eye right here Uh to take this one out over here You look up"
"13513800","13517740"," here to the right Let me see that again They're all that out. "
"13517800","13526520"," I'll make it white So let's just look at this one right here right we just took that we didn't"
"13526520","13531660"," take it actually Uh, we should we need to take it so if you're a bull you need to get"
"13531660","13540060"," above our one So you get rid of this one And then take out this one right here Makes sense"
"13540060","13546220"," so you got to get above our one if you can't get above our one You can't get above it,"
"13546220","13551360"," right Uh, you're not going to take this one out up here Let's win back over here."

"13564940","13575060"," buyer Uh, you need to get above there So you can take that out boat or get above this Even"
"13575060","13578960"," if it pulls back to take that out It's a bit to put it a bit that way get up"
"13578960","13583480"," here right take that first one come back down hit the hourly And then maybe get back up there and"
"13583480","13591360"," take this bad boy out right here So Um I don't know if that's going to happen today and the"
"13591360","13599440"," reason i'm saying that is because Um, you need some you need some strength, right So but you got"
"13599440","13600420"," some key points there. "
"13600480","13601300"," I want to show you something here."
"13601440","13609880"," Okay, it's important Remember what I said earlier about the hourly trigger And how And back in time"
