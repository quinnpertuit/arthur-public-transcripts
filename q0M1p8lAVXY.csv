"q0M1p8lAVXY","69220","76220"," that's what they have to do, they have no choice there, right?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","76220","83220"," It's like bulls have to get up here by end of day, 443.09 by end of day."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","83220","88220"," There is a note to be made with this prediction for end of day here today."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","88220","92220"," So here's your prediction here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","92220","97220"," See this bar right here, I'm going to make this one red."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","98220","100220"," So watch this red bar right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","100220","101220"," This can't fail today."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","101220","106220"," If this fails for bulls, like failure, like, yeah, we blast underneath it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","106220","109220"," Start to do this nonsense, get down in here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","109220","112220"," That's not recovered at any point today."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","112220","116220"," Whole trade is off."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","116220","118220"," So that's what you're looking for here into end of day."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","118220","122220"," It's got an end of day failure in here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","122220","124220"," Ten, this is tomorrow over here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","124220","126220"," You'd have, like, the end of day failure at some point."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","126220","131220"," Come back down, it's like 9.30 open tomorrow, and then the big push higher."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","131220","140220"," And that would trade into Thursday or Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","140220","143220"," Actually, that would trade into, yeah, Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","143220","145220"," Friday morning, 10.30 a.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","145220","146220"," Docker, huh?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","146220","150220"," That's right at the presser for, that's right at the presser for a,"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","150220","152220"," boy, boy, Jerome there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","152220","157220"," So, let's, don't hold me to this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","157220","160220"," Don't hold me to this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","160220","168220"," Presser, Jerome Powell, 4.50, 49."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","168220","171220"," 4.50, 49, and the presser for Jerome Powell."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","171220","179220"," That's going to piss some people off even saying, making that statement."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","179220","181220"," 4.50, 49."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","181220","183220"," Jerome Powell, presser."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","183220","184220"," Do I think that happens?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","184220","186220"," I have no idea."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","186220","188220"," Like horseshoes and hand grenades."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","188220","194220"," It could be like, you know, dollar lower or something like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","194220","195220"," I'll write it down."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","195220","197220"," Hold on a second here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","197220","199220"," Hold on a second here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","199220","201220"," Five minute chart."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","209220","216220"," Oh, boy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","216220","218220"," We'll do this one."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","218220","225220"," Green and huge."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","225220","228220"," Let's go to a wee-bulb chart."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","228220","234220"," Okay, so."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","234220","247220"," Yeah, I got this right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","247220","248220"," Bear with me here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","248220","256220"," I hope this doesn't show up on the screen, but it's something like this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","256220","263220"," Come back down right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","263220","274220"," Right there in the Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","274220","276220"," Big giant move in the Friday right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","276220","277220"," Giant."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","277220","282220"," I don't know if we can get that by Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","282220","287220"," I still wouldn't be surprised if there was a roll down here and you get that"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","287220","289220"," meeting and you get way up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","289220","300220"," All the vol rolls off that meeting that's up there, so maybe I should redraw it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","300220","304220"," End of day failure, right?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","304220","306220"," It's kind of right where you are."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","306220","311220"," Right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","311220","315220"," Maybe something more like this 10 30 in the morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","315220","319220"," And then rip some fucking faces off right here in the clothes and Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","319220","320220"," That'd be impressive."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","320220","324220"," That looks awful, but it's something like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","324220","326220"," Hopefully it disappears from the screen."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","326220","327220"," Nope."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","327220","330220"," It's still there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","330220","334220"," Something like that right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","334220","335220"," It's got to be lower."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","335220","340220"," It's not higher."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","346220","351220"," Move these over as we go."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","351220","353220"," Kind of like bulls only chance here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","353220","358220"," It's kind of like all bulls have."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","358220","360220"," Still sitting a bunch of calls."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","360220","364220"," We already did PT two, so we'll move that one over there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","364220","366220"," We did PT one PT three."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","366220","371220"," We'll bring slide that one over right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","372220","397220"," Let's look at what's up top here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","398220","406220"," They're like fuck you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","406220","408220"," We ain't going nowhere up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","408220","411220"," It's like the gates of the devils are up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","411220","416220"," The sellers are like we ain't going up there, boss."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","428220","437220"," That giant space of consolidation down here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","437220","448220"," This will wipe out the entire chain right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","448220","451220"," Dealers will be happy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","451220","456220"," Yeah, we went there boss, but your zero dates are worthless now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","457220","465220"," If you start breaking this at any point,"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","465220","466220"," be careful than the hair in here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","466220","470220"," They kind of like closing bars underneath."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","470220","482220"," You'll definitely have to sell and reset to the upside."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","482220","486220"," We're on this one here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","486220","489220"," Keep your eyes right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","489220","493220"," Your eyes on this prize right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","493220","496220"," This one right here is the one you want to keep your eyes on."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","496220","501220"," The kind of reversal here to the downside is not going to be pretty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","512220","536220"," Let me fly right now and I'm wondering if I should sell and reposition."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","536220","541220"," If you want to support the stream directly, here's a link."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","541220","552220"," It's the best way to support the stream because YouTube and stream labs take a cut."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","552220","555220"," It's the most direct way to support the stream."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","555220","560220"," Give me that big old squeeze up here, big doggy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","560220","562220"," Give me the daily trigger."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","562220","564220"," Give it to me up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","564220","567220"," I'm going to talk to you guys about this right now so you can see this as we head into the"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","567220","568220"," closed here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","568220","572220"," I'm going to give you guys a heads up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","572220","577220"," As we trade up into this zone here, it's going to get really, really dangerous."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","577220","580220"," Up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","580220","583220"," Can we trade this here?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","583220","586220"," Yes, we can trade this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","586220","589220"," But I want you to know that it's not going to be a fun ride."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","589220","593220"," At any moment, there could be a major reversal here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","593220","596220"," Here, here, here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","597220","602220"," My recommendation here is going to be raise your stops as we go up there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","602220","607220"," Or maybe you take some calls that are farther out in time, Friday, next week, something like"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","607220","608220"," that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","608220","611220"," We're going to get a little long in the tooth as we head up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","611220","614220"," As we go up here, this is the long part of the tooth up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","614220","617220"," I can't stand when we do stuff like this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","617220","618220"," We blast off."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","618220","625220"," There's a big red bar and someone comes in the chat and says, I didn't get long here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","626220","629220"," And then I got trapped out here, you know, or I don't like hearing in the chat."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","629220","631220"," Should I take calls here, Cap?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","631220","632220"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","632220","634220"," And I'll be honest with you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","634220","636220"," I've actually trade that right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","636220","637220"," It's possible."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","637220","641220"," So if you're going to trade this with me, make sure that you can either lose all that money."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","641220","643220"," You're raising your stops."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","643220","646220"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","646220","647220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","647220","649220"," Just watch this right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","649220","653220"," Your eyes on this where my cursor is up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","653220","658220"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","658220","667220"," So we had a big conversation going back in the springtime."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","667220","668220"," Not any plays right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","668220","671220"," I got nothing on the table."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","671220","675220"," If they can get above this fourth forty three, I'd take a trade."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","675220","679220"," There's two hundred and fifty thousand calls that were just put on the market."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","679220","682220"," So the dealers are not going to want to pay them."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","682220","684220"," We know that that number is right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","684220","686220"," This will be in the money right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","686220","689220"," Do they want to pay those calls?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","689220","691220"," Fuck no, they don't want to pay those calls."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","691220","695220"," There's a possibility they could send it up and then bring it back down to the close."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","695220","696220"," Yeah, possible."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","696220","698220"," What do I think happens?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","698220","706220"," I think we do this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","707220","711220"," And I think we see where is that bad boy down there?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","711220","716220"," I think we see this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","716220","721220"," Into I think we see this into the open tomorrow at nine thirty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","721220","722220"," Blood."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","722220","725220"," And then this right here recovery."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","725220","730220"," Now, if in that interviewing they get really nasty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","731220","735220"," That nine thirty morning bullshit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","735220","737220"," That nine thirty is nasty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","737220","741220"," Not willing to buy this and furthermore to that point."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","741220","743220"," Let's talk about tomorrow really quick."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","743220","745220"," Go over to."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","745220","748220"," So just into tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","748220","753220"," If you are a bull looking for a dip by."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","753220","756220"," You are looking for this to be defended right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","757220","758220"," So it's after."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","758220","759220"," Three o'clock."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","759220","761220"," So let's talk about tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","761220","765220"," So let's review yesterday to yesterday's close yesterday into the close."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","765220","769220"," We were below the hourly trigger and the half hour trigger right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","769220","770220"," Right."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","770220","772220"," Talked about this in the close."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","772220","775220"," Yesterday we actually gave it a target here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","775220","777220"," Give you that exact number."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","777220","781220"," No, four thirty nine point six."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","781220","782220"," It's like I ain't buying shit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","782220","783220"," Let's run up above here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","784220","787220"," I said there's not a lot of time left for bulls to save themselves."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","787220","789220"," And what was the bar right before the open this morning?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","789220","790220"," Does anybody know?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","790220","791220"," This four thirty nine twenty six."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","791220","794220"," Right for the open four thirty nine twenty six."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","794220","795220"," We ripped higher."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","795220","797220"," This number right here was the key."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","797220","798220"," Right."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","798220","799220"," We got above it this morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","799220","800220"," Start up and faces off."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","800220","803220"," So going back to the trigger screen here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","803220","807220"," If you are a bull."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","807220","808220"," Here are your options."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","808220","810220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","810220","814220"," If price can get above the twenty seven EMA."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","814220","817220"," You can take this trade up."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","817220","820220"," Right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","820220","822220"," Four forty four fifty ish."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","822220","824220"," You might get a little push higher here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","824220","828220"," That's trade for you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","828220","829220"," Next thing."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","829220","830220"," If you're looking for a dip to buy tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","830220","831220"," It's down here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","831220","833220"," Four forty fifty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","833220","834220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","834220","835220"," On tomorrow's open."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","835220","836220"," That's what you're going to be wanting to buy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","836220","838220"," If at any point we break below tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","838220","839220"," You've got no trade to buy down here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","839220","840220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","840220","842220"," If you're a bull that's what you're looking for."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","842220","844220"," If we squeeze above."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","844220","848220"," It is not tenable until the hourly comes up in supports."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","848220","850220"," So any kind of squeezing above here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","850220","852220"," I don't expect it to hold."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","852220","855220"," I want to see price come back down and confirm."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","855220","857220"," On this hourly trigger."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","857220","860220"," So if you're a bull you'll be tactful here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","860220","862220"," What are my expectations into tomorrow?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","862220","865220"," So we're going to go back to the weebull chart."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","865220","866220"," Right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","867220","871220"," Get a little bit of squeezing going on right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","871220","872220"," You've got."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","872220","875220"," 260,000 calls right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","875220","878220"," So if you're looking for a trade as a bull you might have this"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","878220","879220"," foul hollow trade in the close."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","879220","881220"," I would not attempt to hold on to it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","881220","883220"," I'll get rid of it before the ending close today."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","883220","887220"," Even if it's between four fifteen and six p.m. they could still."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","887220","889220"," Even if it takes the four fifteen or six p.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","889220","892220"," They're still not going to want to close all these calls in the"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","892220","893220"," money."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","894220","895220"," And you guys have trade spreads."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","895220","896220"," Know this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","896220","899220"," The finagle in or the wink wink stuff happens between four fifteen"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","899220","900220"," and six."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","900220","903220"," So even if we go up here into this close."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","903220","906220"," They can run it right back down into six o'clock."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","906220","915220"," And not pay those calls out after six."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","915220","922220"," So I'm trying to get on this trade right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","923220","926220"," I'm on this trade to the upside again right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","926220","927220"," I'm long again."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","927220","929220"," So just be aware of that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","929220","930220"," Be aware of that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","930220","934220"," Even if NVDA has a great earnings."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","934220","936220"," That you could see the market squeeze higher."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","936220","937220"," Squeeze."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","937220","939220"," You could see it squeeze higher come back down."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","939220","942220"," Squeeze up here and still come back down by six fifteen."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","942220","944220"," So they're not closing those calls in the money."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","944220","949220"," So just be aware of all this stuff here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","950220","954220"," Expectation on tomorrow's open."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","954220","956220"," Even with any kind of squeezing in here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","956220","958220"," Even with a good spec earnings."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","958220","960220"," This is still going to be down."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","960220","964220"," Let me see if I can count the hours here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","964220","967220"," Target open tomorrow four forty two to the downside."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","967220","970220"," So if you want a downside target for tomorrow four forty two."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","970220","975220"," Leave this right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","975220","978220"," Slide that over so you can see it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","978220","980220"," The downside target four forty two."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","980220","981220"," Into Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","981220","984220"," Upside target four fifty four forty eight."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","984220","989220"," Said four fifty earlier but four forty eight for an upside target into Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","989220","994220"," If you get the four fifty or a breach above you get like four fifty or forty two or something like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","994220","995220"," That's all free money for you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","995220","997220"," But the like the conservative."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","997220","999220"," What to expect in a Friday four forty eight."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","999220","1004220"," Is the upside target."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1004220","1009220"," This morning on the opening bell I closed puts and went long the market right on the opening bell I closed this morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1009220","1017220"," If you're in the stream you knew that first thing this morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1017220","1019220"," I was stationed in South Korea."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1019220","1024220"," Maybe that should all the time."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1024220","1028220"," So I'm going to give you guys an update here so that you guys are crystal clear here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1028220","1031220"," Crystal clear so you're not spreading stuff that you don't know what you're talking about here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1031220","1033220"," Or maybe you're trying to cloud tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1033220","1034220"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1034220","1035220"," The last time."

"q0M1p8lAVXY","1093220","1094220"," Bye bye."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1099220","1100220"," Future is trading."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1100220","1102220"," We're going to do that coming up the next week or two."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1102220","1109220"," We're going to do a whole futures series like three four days something like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1109220","1110220"," Eastern standard time."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1110220","1113220"," So I'm going to expect at nine thirty."

"q0M1p8lAVXY","1114220","1115220"," I said it earlier."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1115220","1117220"," These guys are going to be like you're going to have two groups of people."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1117220","1119220"," You're going to have like the bad guy and the good guy right."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1119220","1121220"," Or you're going to get the bad guy and the bad guy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1121220","1123220"," You're going to get the good guy and the good guy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1123220","1124220"," So when we come into that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1124220","1126220"," They're going to set a tone tomorrow morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1126220","1128220"," Until into Friday."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1128220","1131220"," So be aware of that tomorrow ten a.m. ten oh five."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1131220","1132220"," To be exact."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1132220","1133220"," Ten oh five."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1137220","1139220"," No so XLF was at a just heads up."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1139220","1140220"," So good question."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1140220","1142220"," So Chase is asking about XLF."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1142220","1143220"," We're going to talk about XLF right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1143220","1144220"," You want to do that?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1144220","1145220"," You can talk about it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1145220","1152220"," XLF is not ignoring the downgrades XLF was on a cliff going back to top my head."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1152220","1154220"," I think March eight February eight or March eight."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1154220","1157220"," You go back and look at XLF and March eight or February eight."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1157220","1158220"," I do my work at nighttime."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1158220","1160220"," I just don't always talk about it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1160220","1163220"," So XLF as of last night was on a cliff."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1163220","1166220"," Send the S&P 500 down to."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1166220","1168220"," It's weekly."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1168220","1171220"," Target right that weekly that weekly trigger."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1171220","1174220"," And that's what we did back on that date in February or March."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1174220","1176220"," I was doing this off top of my head."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1176220","1177220"," But I did look at it myself."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1177220","1181220"," I looked at it last night on XLF and I was like hey if we roll here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1181220","1183220"," It ain't going to be pretty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1183220","1185220"," It ain't going to be good."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1185220","1189220"," And then this morning we got poor trigger pull cluster that are right on that target number."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1189220","1191220"," And that was saying we were going up in a big way."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1191220","1193220"," And that's what we did say we went up in a big way."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1193220","1196220"," So switched from defensive to offensive."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1196220","1198220"," And of course that's what we did all day long is go up."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1202220","1203220"," Yeah."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1203220","1204220"," Futures will be fun."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1204220","1206220"," I don't want to get into trading futures."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1206220","1207220"," I don't know."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1207220","1212220"," I don't want to get into trading futures because it keeps me awake at nighttime and I fucking hate it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1212220","1214220"," Like I like cash market."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1214220","1215220"," There's more normal hours."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1215220","1218220"," But then I'm on there fucking middle of the night trading this shit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1218220","1221220"," But I know some of you guys can't hedge."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1221220","1224220"," So I'm like I got this like whole other thing where I'm like."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1224220","1230220"," This whole entire thing where like I know some of you guys are only trading cash market."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1230220","1232220"," I'm almost positive of it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1232220","1237220"," So if you could put like one, three, four, five thousand dollars in an account."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1237220","1242220"," And hedge yourself at nighttime it would it would serve you well."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1242220","1243220"," It would help you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1243220","1248220"," It would help you to take less losses believe it or not."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1248220","1251220"," So if you see the market start to sell off the middle of the night."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1251220","1254220"," If you see the market bounce anything like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1254220","1257220"," Support step in anything like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1257220","1258220"," You need to shift."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1258220","1265220"," You need to be able to do that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1265220","1275220"," I think the bull case is I truly believe that the bull case is to buffer whatever is coming down the road."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1275220","1283220"," That's what I think most of this is even even even back from back in May, June and October of last year."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1284220","1290220"," It's just buffering for the eventual major role that we're going to get."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1290220","1296220"," So I think we get that role in spring or I think it's springtime or late late winter."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1296220","1298220"," Could be now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1298220","1300220"," Could be now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1300220","1303220"," I'm not a fucking crystal ball."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1303220","1310220"," But if they had a plan, I think it's something like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1310220","1314220"," Yeah, if you got like three grand, I think you had like fifteen hundred."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1314220","1318220"," You could probably do the the micros or something."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1318220","1320220"," Trade the micros."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1320220","1322220"," I wrote a whole bunch of stuff up for it too."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1322220","1323220"," So I got like a whole."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1323220","1325220"," I have an outline of what to talk about with you guys."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1325220","1328220"," Things you have to know about trading futures."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1328220","1331220"," Benefits and."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1332220","1340220"," It's not a logical."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1340220","1342220"," It's a I don't think it's logical at all."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1342220","1348220"," You can actually look and actually look at every time we crash where it happens from, right?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1348220","1350220"," It happens at a top."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1350220","1352220"," Not on the bottom."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1352220","1354220"," It's on top."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1355220","1359220"," Every single fucking time."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1359220","1363220"," Every single time."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1363220","1367220"," There's one time where we failed to make a new high."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1367220","1368220"," I think it won."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1368220","1369220"," I think maybe two."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1369220","1372220"," One or two."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1372220","1378220"," I think when I looked it up, it was two in the complete history of the stock market."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1378220","1381220"," Not once every two years."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1381220","1385220"," If you look up the number of times we kept going are."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1385220","1388220"," Thousands."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1388220","1399220"," Thousands and thousands and thousands of times."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1399220","1405220"," Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1405220","1407220"," You can take them off every time."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1408220","1410220"," We can look at them one Sunday if you want."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1410220","1411220"," We can do a show."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1411220","1414220"," Do we can show them all off for you?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1414220","1416220"," I'm all."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1416220","1419220"," You got two times where you didn't get the new to the all time high."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1419220","1423220"," Vice."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1423220","1426220"," Even if you rolled, you still got that all time high."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1426220","1429220"," Time out when you failed to get the all time high."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1429220","1430220"," Very rare."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1430220","1436220"," The number of times that we actually went up there and got that all time high and then rolled down is a small number."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1436220","1441220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1441220","1445220"," Here's E.S."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1445220","1450220"," E.S. have nothing to do with this right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1457220","1463220"," Now I'm going to show you two levels for you to be looking out on E.S."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1464220","1471220"," I'll do NQ for you as well."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1471220","1475220"," 44.72.50 to the upside."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1475220","1480220"," And then don't be caught dead down here anywhere."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1480220","1484220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1484220","1485220"," 44.32."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1485220","1487220"," This will move though as the night moves on."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1487220","1489220"," This will come up."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1489220","1491220"," It'll be like 44.20."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1491220","1493220"," So this basically this level right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1493220","1496220"," Take your money and run kind of stuff."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1496220","1499220"," So right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1499220","1510220"," So if you're short E.S. or anything like that, you're going to be hoping and praying for some kind of a move up and then down like this and then down here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1510220","1511220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1511220","1513220"," What's you hoping for?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1513220","1517220"," Don't get squeezed out if we break above because it'll likely come back anyway."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1517220","1519220"," You're short E.S."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1519220","1520220"," This applies to cues too."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1520220","1524220"," If you're like a panicking now, I'm freaking out."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1524220","1526220"," Do that carry right over there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1526220","1530220"," Okay. You got to like be able to carry it over here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1530220","1533220"," This likely does not hold if we go there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1533220","1534220"," It needs."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1534220","1536220"," It needs."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1536220","1540220"," It needs this to follow here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1540220","1542220"," Like even if it looks all bullish and shit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1542220","1544220"," It's still going to roll and come back down."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1544220","1546220"," See if you still have it out is my point."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1546220","1547220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1547220","1553220"," So if it does continue to go up, look for that out at 4.42 ish."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1553220","1555220"," Someone down somewhere down in here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1555220","1558220"," You'll likely be given an out."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1558220","1562220"," Thank you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1562220","1566220"," Shit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1566220","1567220"," Thank you, man."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1568220","1575220"," I want you to see this here in NQ."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1575220","1577220"," On NQ."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1577220","1584220"," I'm not one that believes that NQ can go higher."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1584220","1585220"," Without the hourly trigger."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1585220","1586220"," I'm not that guy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1586220","1588220"," So look at the 30 minute here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1588220","1591220"," See if I'm wrong."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1591220","1596220"," You know, you're probably going to get a squeeze up here on NQ."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1596220","1598220"," You're probably going to get a squeeze."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1598220","1602220"," There's that target up there, but."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1602220","1605220"," You'll be looking for these targets to sell by open tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1605220","1609220"," I'm going to warn you of something here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1609220","1610220"," Sorry."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1610220","1615220"," This is for me for NQ, but normally."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1615220","1618220"," If we squeeze up."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1618220","1620220"," You'll get a chance to get out."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1620220","1622220"," I want to warn you though."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1622220","1625220"," You have the hourly trigger coming up right here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1626220","1628220"," So."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1628220","1631220"," If that holds."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1631220","1634220"," We start going up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1634220","1635220"," It's going to get nasty."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1635220","1640220"," You're going to get a phone call."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1640220","1643220"," So just be really careful in here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1643220","1645220"," If you're like a tech short or something like that,"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1645220","1647220"," worse than S&P 500."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1647220","1649220"," Very dangerous."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1649220","1652220"," If you're short NQ."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1652220","1654220"," Very dangerous."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1654220","1657220"," If you say something to you, if you're a short dude like."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1657220","1659220"," We go down here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1659220","1662220"," Get out of your fucking short until this here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1662220","1665220"," Starts starts to go down to remake your money."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1665220","1668220"," Don't go short until you're under under this."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1668220","1671220"," Like closing bars closing fucking bars shouldn't be trading the ship."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1671220","1674220"," You don't know what I'm talking about."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1674220","1677220"," But there's real danger here if you're short."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1677220","1681220"," I didn't see that earlier."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1681220","1684220"," You know, they closed the fucking market for an hour."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1684220","1686220"," And before you know it, you're up here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1686220","1690220"," 6 p.m. rolls around and see you later."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1690220","1694220"," Be really careful in a six o'clock here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1694220","1702220"," That's a fucking trap and a half right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1702220","1703220"," Yeah."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1703220","1704220"," Yeah."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1704220","1707220"," If you're a bear."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1708220","1710220"," If you start to see any action."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1710220","1712220"," Like mark these numbers here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1712220","1715220"," Like 15 to 10."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1715220","1720220"," Like if you see stupid shit like this happening and it starts to go up like that."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1720220","1723220"," Fucking stops right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1723220","1730220"," Is it ain't going to stop because you're going to see this hourly come up and it's going to be."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1731220","1733220"," Six o'clock in the morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1733220","1735220"," You'll know by six a.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1735220","1738220"," It like that's best case scenario for you."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1738220","1742220"," I don't know what time this is here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1742220","1744220"," Probably be awake around."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1744220","1747220"," I'm going to tell you when you're going to be awake."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1747220","1749220"," Where?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1750220","1752220"," Around nine o'clock."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1752220","1755220"," Somewhere around nine p.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1755220","1757220"," 11 o'clock tonight."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1757220","1759220"," I don't even think you get until 2 a.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1759220","1761220"," Think nine, nine p.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1761220","1762220"," You're going to know."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1762220","1764220"," You'll probably have an out of nine."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1764220","1765220"," I hope that you do."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1765220","1767220"," I don't want you guys to lose money if you're a bear."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1767220","1768220"," So."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1768220","1769220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1769220","1770220"," So I'm going to leave you here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1770220","1771220"," Around nine p.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1771220","1772220"," 11 o'clock tonight."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1772220","1774220"," I don't even think you get until 2 a.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1774220","1776220"," Think nine, nine p.m."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1776220","1777220"," You're going to know."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1777220","1778220"," You'll probably have an out of nine."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1778220","1779220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1779220","1782220"," So I'm going to leave you with this switch back over into tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1782220","1784220"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1784220","1787220"," Would not be surprised to see it all come back down by am."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1787220","1791220"," We are above the daily trigger right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1791220","1793220"," Not bullish yet."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1793220","1797220"," Needs to recheck daily trigger in cash market."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1797220","1799220"," All this is fake."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1799220","1803220"," So like in cash market, you need to see price."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1803220","1807220"," Come back down and test daily with the early underneath it."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1808220","1810220"," Team begin to talk about being bullish here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1810220","1813220"," So don't don't get started with like."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1813220","1816220"," I want to see one fucking fin to it being bullish."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1816220","1818220"," The squeeze comes right back."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1818220","1822220"," It always the every time it comes every single time it comes back."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1822220","1826220"," It has to prove in cash market that it's going on."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1830220","1831220"," Okay."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1831220","1833220"," So I will see you guys to mark."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1833220","1835220"," Do you guys have any questions before I go."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1836220","1838220"," See you guys in the morning."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1840220","1842220"," Review where where Nvidia is going."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1842220","1844220"," So the implied move was hit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1844220","1848220"," I haven't heard their guidance yet to see what they have to say."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1848220","1850220"," Seems like they made their target."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1850220","1857220"," Even if you get a pullback in NVDA, you'll likely see it tag it again during cash market."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1857220","1863220"," They have to announce something extra special duper super duper for it to go any higher from where it is right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1864220","1866220"," If they announce anything crazy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1871220","1874220"," If they announce anything crazy."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1874220","1876220"," Let me do a measure here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1876220","1877220"," Give me a second."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1877220","1881220"," Dude, NQ is just fucking ripping right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1881220","1883220"," It is fucking ripping."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1886220","1889220"," It is fucking ripping right."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1889220","1890220"," Oh man, dude."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1890220","1891220"," Oh man."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1891220","1892220"," Oh man."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1893220","1894220"," Oh man."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1894220","1895220"," That's where I want to be."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1895220","1896220"," Hold on a second here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1896220","1899220"," Now you want upside targets for NVDA."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1901220","1902220"," Hold on here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1906220","1907220"," One quick second."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1916220","1917220"," I got to measure this shit."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1917220","1918220"," Hold on."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1923220","1926220"," What am I doing here?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1930220","1931220"," Ready?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1936220","1937220"," 5478."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1937220","1939220"," I don't think you get that right now though."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1941220","1943220"," I don't think you get that right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1943220","1944220"," 5478."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1944220","1945220"," High target."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1945220","1947220"," I don't think you get that right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1947220","1949220"," I'm not going to tell you that's going to happen."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1949220","1951220"," I don't think you get that for some time period."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1953220","1954220"," There it is right there."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1954220","1955220"," I don't think you get that right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1955220","1956220"," I think they're going to fill those calls up."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1956220","1957220"," They're going to set it back down."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1957220","1958220"," This is on board for you though."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1958220","1981220"," If outside of market conditions outside of"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1982220","1987220"," options outside of no bad news coming out."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1987220","1988220"," The next half an hour."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1988220","1992220"," You're targeting 554."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1992220","1993220"," 81."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1993220","1994220"," 78."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1994220","1995220"," Sorry."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","1995220","1996220"," I said 81 at 78."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2000220","2002220"," 25 billion share buyback."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2003220","2005220"," Just do the opposite all the time."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2005220","2007220"," Whenever you're going to hit the spy or sell button,"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2007220","2009220"," just do the opposite man."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2009220","2016220"," I love you brother."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2016220","2019220"," I think there were coming back so."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2019220","2026220"," I'm assuming that the bears are gone right now."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2026220","2029220"," I'm assuming that there's no more bears in the broadcast here."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2029220","2053220"," I think we pull back off NVDA unless I unless there's something I'm missing mostly as it's mostly a function. I'm not wanting to pay it. So, the buyback's not good enough for right now. It's like another after the 25th. I think you make that move to the upside. I can be wrong, but I think it's after the 25th."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2053220","2057220"," I love you, Nita."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2058220","2069220"," Love you too, Stacy. I'll see all of you guys tomorrow. I'll see you at 9.30 in the morning. We'll play the interviews live for you at 10.05."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2069220","2073220"," Let's see what they have to say. We'll see where this market's going."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2074220","2081220"," 445.01 high tick on spoons closer to 450 than we think, right?"
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2081220","2084220"," Closer than we think."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2084220","2089220"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow. Please like and subscribe these videos."

"q0M1p8lAVXY","2099220","2103220"," The viewers of like 560 or something. It's probably like 2000 viewers."
"q0M1p8lAVXY","2103220","2107220"," I want to make that next step. So, if you can do that for me, I appreciate it. Does help out."
