"2077270","2085870"," over here in this room I Live at a rotation going on right now We've got Jerome Powell. "
"2086210","2088610"," I believe is he speaking today at a luncheon at some point."
"2088790","2097940"," We'll have to find out I think I don't know exactly what time that is Fascinating fascinatingly"
"2097940","2107830"," enough On spx Let's look at spx look at how scary"
"2107830","2117540"," that looks Look at spx ever check this out spx"
"2117540","2124880"," has a gap to close down here right and it also lines up with It also lines up with a"
"2124880","2130120"," check right Usually you get your check come back down here confirm Remember we talk about this all"
"2130120","2135620"," the time and this show all the time I talked to you about you get the initial squeeze And then"
"2135620","2141780"," you're going to get the confirmation and this is where the money is Right if this confirms that's"
"2141780","2142440"," where the money is."
"2142560","2149300"," So this is spx right now And I'm going to put spx on a higher time frame for you And"
"2149300","2151620"," so let's just look at spx in a higher time frame. "
"2151920","2158240"," This is spx This is a one day time frame here and you know, we don't like to trade with"
"2158240","2165500"," classic Uh like old school trading the stuff, but you know it does sometimes help right like maybe"
"2165500","2169980"," 30 percent of the time 40 percent of the time it helps It's like small tool in your in your"
"2169980","2171540"," basket of tools and look at that."
"2171740","2176240"," There's a gap closed down below here There would be two things that I would tell you here."
"2176620","2178400"," Well, first we've got the true range, right?"
"2178680","2183860"," That's actually true range up there And they've got the what we drew these out last week yellow and"
"2183860","2187220"," red Uh, we could draw another one in down below here. "
"2187220","2193140"," Of course the yellow one we could do one more Now there's two things to note here and the first"
"2193140","2200180"," would be Then if we leave this gap behind now we can leave gaps behind I think whether we can"
"2200180","2204940"," but if we do leave this gap behind And just trade up and close this gap I would I would"
"2204940","2209740"," I would bet that there's a high chance to come back down and close this gap If the bulls are"
"2209740","2218180"," looking for Uh like a positive Continuation we would come back down and close this gap today and"
"2218180","2219100"," then continue higher."
"2219160","2222520"," This would be the healthiest For a bull believe it or not."
"2222620","2223640"," No bulls out there like none. "
"2223780","2228480"," I let's go close that gap right now I'm like now if we do this one here then in got"
"2228480","2236400"," the confirmation Right if we get the confirmation, this is a huge move here and big money is my"
"2236400","2247620"," point so uh just checking on spx I don't know"
"2247620","2248080"," one hour."
"2248300","2253300"," You can see it is a one-hour chart on spx Uh, we're gonna look to see if we can"
"2253300","2259820"," close this gap down below And not only the gap, but you could even get like like the the ha"
"2259820","2265880"," ha ha down here And then you start actually cutting up here To close this uh 410 and we know"
"2265880","2270280"," for a fact that there's supply up here Remember I told you about that supply I was like hey,"
"2270400","2277900"," there's a big hidden supply zone above An spx up here at 410 Well, so we'll monitor this as the"
"2277900","2284480"," day moves forward Uh, we'll hopefully we'll get two or three rounds of call buyers And see how this"
"2284480","2285340"," works itself out."
"2285620","2291360"," This is also going to matter Uh as we come into the 31st with positioning in the market if we"
"2291360","2297440"," get super bearish We could trade up here to fill this If we get a super bearish uh hedging"
"2297440","2302940"," opportunity If it's uh a bullish hedging opportunity will probably trap the bulls and it can head"
"2302940","2307520"," lower believe it or not Unless we get some kind of waterfall call buying waterfall put buying"
"2307520","2311700"," something like that So let's look back on the one minute chart here. "
"2312080","2317240"," Let's look back here See that that gap that needs filled right here."
"2317420","2318720"," This is a one-hour chart."
"2319260","2321040"," You can see that we're supportive here, right?"
"2321240","2327320"," You can see You got support here and you got support here if we trade it down here and then"
"2327320","2333840"," maybe grab this For that continuation move that we're looking for to 408 Now this would this would"
"2333840","2335000"," make logical sense. "
"2335140","2337400"," I don't bears like Yeah, we're gonna get down here."
"2337540","2338260"," We're gonna crash through this."
"2338360","2338660"," We're gonna crash. "
"2338720","2347680"," We're gonna we're gonna You know drop the bulls and they're dead Right So we'll eyeball this But"
"2347680","2354200"," this is good news right now for the bulls bulls have There's like It's a big time bull trap."
"2354440","2354980"," Don't worry about it."
"2355140","2358540"," We got the vix we're on a low right now But the cool part is you could get the vix"
"2358540","2364660"," up And then get that continuation that you're looking for for the bulls So we'll we'll keep an eye"
"2364660","2370080"," on the vix this morning When you can see we got a little bit of a bump here. "
"2370200","2377900"," I'm throwing some h lines right now for you This is an h line right here We got another h"
"2377900","2387860"," line down below We had another h line up here Some"

"13973840","13979420"," It's not you it's i've just done it too many times you'll have a hard time to understand it What"

"13988940","13996640"," with You're going to hear people tell you that the jpm caller is not large enough to impact the"
"13996640","14004700"," market You're also going to hear people tell you that there are better ways to hedge the market jpm"
"14004700","14013460"," looks at it like twofold uh number one It works for them and because it's not broke they don't fix"
"14013460","14022180"," it If they've done it for a very long time it's called it's actually called a bearish seagull i"
"14022180","14031420"," think it's a seagull it's bearish seagull and um Not only does jpm trade this but other prime banks"
"14031420","14038160"," trade this then mid-sized people will trade this a lot of people like to mimic for model against"
"14038160","14046140"," that trade and then you got retailers do the same shit and uh But they don't follow what jpm does"
"14046140","14052820"," right that they don't only follow that one thing um The implication around that trade is like two"
"14052820","14064340"," or threefold That's boss's congress needs to increase the debt ceiling Or"
"14064340","14071100"," it's impact it's separate have downside protection Uh the intent of the trade is to have downside"
"14071100","14077960"," protection uh Another impact of that trade is that they they don't need the entire trade to print"
"14082200","14092160"," The trade is built to pay for itself And also to offer protection to the downside"
"14093060","14098720"," So if we go down unexpectedly on unknown events that hit the hit the market they're protected"
"14099400","14106320"," There's another impact on this trade, which is that it it's implied for it to temper and limit"
"14107220","14115620"," Volatility to the up and downside That's it so if if the if you got the real money buying and"
"14115620","14125440"," selling In the market This is where the options market is overrun by large"
"14125440","14133780"," buyers or sellers But then there's times in the market on low volume days White House says Taiwan's"
"14133780","14139220"," president size trip to the US is consistent with the one China policy, which remains unchanged"
"14140420","14150400"," Where the options market has an impact on the market in its direction uh The banks also want"
"14150400","14160060"," to have uh An impact on the options market so they don't want like retailers And hedge funds"
"14160060","14167240"," having all the control over the market So by placing that trade it also tempers Uh Though"
"14167240","14173300"," volatility that the options market can lend to our stock market So there's an implication here that"

"14264300","14272300"," be at zero Then you'd have companies that were Way overvalued And That would become more volatile"
"14272300","14279420"," as they became more valid or less valuable So you could and then you would see the part the list"
"14279420","14287020"," of participants become smaller the pool of participants So if like Tesla got bid to the you know"
"14287020","14292640"," bazillion dollars You probably only have a few people able to trade that up to that And that would"
