"113370","114030"," All right."

"117070","117950"," Good morning. "
"118270","119330"," Good morning, Dana."
"120570","122130"," Good morning, little big bear."

"128650","129169"," Good morning, AK."
"129570","131050"," Greetings, Euro Boomer. "
"132010","132790"," Everybody's doing well."
"135590","136970"," Okay, yeah, let's talk about that."
"137250","137530"," Beth, Beth. "
"138990","140390"," We, good morning, San."
"141530","143770"," Okay, we have to talk about something real quick for the start of this morning."
"143910","144750"," Okay, we only got a few minutes. "
"145750","146550"," It's important to talk about this."
"148410","150570"," We need to get this off the table here."
"150850","151330"," A couple things. "
"151730","153070"," We are coming into FMC today."
"153550","154310"," Good morning, Patrick."
"154750","156050"," Good morning, Quantum Leap. "
"156710","157410"," Good morning, Kari."
"157550","158190"," Good morning, Mihai."
"158670","159230"," Morning, Eric. "
"159950","160910"," Morning, Josh, brother."
"161810","162330"," Azul, Blue."
"163290","163870"," Autopaca, too. "
"164170","164890"," Frederick, in light productions."
"165710","166750"," Good morning to everybody out there."
"166930","168350"," Hope everybody is doing well this morning. "
"172520","173380"," Good morning."
"174840","175860"," Good morning, MB."
"176420","177780"," Hope everybody is doing well this morning. "
"178780","180900"," So, we have a little conversation here this morning."
"180900","182200"," We'll keep this real short, okay?"
"184140","185680"," The ban hammer is out."
"188380","189440"," Good morning, Jason. "
"190420","191500"," So, I'm going to leave it at that."
"191860","193540"," I'm not going to discuss it again at this point."
"195340","196460"," The ban hammer is out. "
"197880","199440"," Now, for the rest of you out there."
"201680","202720"," Good morning, Michael."
"202720","206260"," I can't have poisoning inside the stream. "
"206280","207400"," So, I'm going to leave it there, okay?"
"208080","209980"," Now, we have to talk about something this morning."
"211400","215320"," I want to show you guys a couple things critical to get this information out to you, okay?"
"216340","218180"," I want all of you to remember a few things."
"218520","220060"," We called this turn above here, okay?"
"221320","223500"," We rode this rip up together here. "
"224320","225980"," We called this turn down here."
"227440","229520"," I remember when we were down here around 460."
"230260","232200"," Everybody said it was going up. "
"233500","235580"," We traded this up and down and up again."
"235600","237440"," We traded this down, right?"
"237640","240080"," We traded this down over here and this down over here."
"240400","244420"," I want you to remember that no one thought it was going to 450. "
"245020","248940"," There was a few, I think Master Wu and Twitter thought, 450 and we're done."
"250000","252360"," We were talking about going lower to 4400."
"252700","255640"," We were talking about going lower to 428. "
"255640","263060"," We talked about going down to 420 and as we got down here, we talked about going down to 409,"
"263400","266220"," 410, 418 somewhere in there."
"266700","269780"," One last move down here while no one was talking about that."
"272600","274400"," Now, I have some issues. "
"275580","279780"," So, when you go down this much, damage is done."
"280540","286920"," But also at the same time, like calling the apple top at 190, if you trade up to 186, that's"
"286920","287380"," good enough."
"289260","292540"," Another thing is that the market can change at any time. "
"293020","300960"," During one of these moves down here, we were supposed to snap back trade up at that time to roughly"
"300960","302300"," 4550."
"303780","305820"," You know that did not happen, right?"
"308520","313220"," Everyone stayed long in here because they were told we were going up and we did not go up."
"313400","313880"," We were rejected. "
"314600","315640"," We came back down."
"316040","318460"," This could have been the test down here."
"320160","321660"," One and two. "
"322580","329800"," Now, it is most certainly, but the bears still think, right, and I still think to an extent that"
"329800","333500"," the test is we come up here, we reject and we come back down one more time."
"335140","337500"," Okay, and this is still on the table here."
"338040","339720"," I need you to understand that. "
"342580","351760"," Now, there was a trade last summer at some point in 2021 that we did not do this retest"
"351760","354680"," and we just traded higher."
"355100","356680"," It was a very similar setup."
"357100","358700"," So, why don't you guys understand that?"
"360600","363500"," As we get into today, there's a few things going on. "
"363500","366780"," Typically, with the FOMC, they will still pause the market."
"369000","371580"," So, we could trade just sideways off the bell here."
"372080","375640"," Now, I want to tell you guys to buy my calls off the bell here today, but I'm going to"
"375640","376400"," be honest with you. "
"376860","380280"," There is a fair chance off the bell that we don't trade higher."
"380720","385740"," We could wait to trade higher to this major resistance above here."
"386620","391000"," Later in the day, we could come off the bell and just do this kind of nonsense and boom. "
"391500","394160"," We could come off the bell and trade up here, right?"
"394440","397020"," Then trade down into the two o'clock hour."
"397400","399800"," We could come into the bell and just blast right through here."
"401160","406240"," Before we come up here to this area or just slightly above, and if we have any bad earnings, trade"
"406240","409060"," back down and do this retest way down here. "
"409420","412120"," We could even trade above here and come back down next week."
"413200","417840"," After all of the big tech is done reporting."
"418960","420280"," So, keep that on your plate. "
"420780","425540"," And like always, we talk about trading to the level, right?"
"426060","430440"," Getting out of your trade and then picking it up once again if it continues on."
"431280","436260"," We don't ever talk around here about going short here, right?"
"436880","442880"," Diamond handing it, holding that short down here, diving handing it, going short down here, diving"
"442880","447660"," handing it, going short down here, diamond handing it, and then going short down here."
"447980","452740"," And if we don't do this one last through, this one last breakthrough, you know, if we end up"
"452740","457520"," breaking above here, here, and here, you come on my channel and blame me. "
"459480","460980"," I don't want to fucking hear it."
"463160","463680"," Okay."
"464780","466880"," Because this happened in March two. "
"467140","472880"," And when this happened in March 2020, I do remember people just continuing the diamond hand."
"472880","480880"," The talk, the bear talk got so unreal that we were told that the market was crashing, right?"
"481200","485520"," And meanwhile, everybody's moved on and you're the only ones sitting there holding the bags."
"486060","487720"," So, this is not that channel. "
"488100","489620"," This will never become that channel."
"490200","492460"," If you want that channel, you need to go elsewhere."
"493680","494100"," Okay. "
"495240","496300"," We can't have it."
"496460","498640"," We can't have it for a reason, okay?"
"498640","504720"," Even if you're committed to a viewpoint on the markets, if the market decides it's going somewhere"
"504720","507680"," else, this is not how you ever trade it."
"508080","510020"," You take your profits and you move on. "
"510360","512120"," You take your profit and you move on."
"512580","518760"," There was a time that you could trade this market where, directionally, you could almost guarantee"
"518760","520880"," it was going to where you wanted it to go."
"521280","525500"," These days, too many people trade this market and it never does that anymore. "
"526400","528060"," You have to be a quicker trader."
"528500","532080"," You have to be a quicker investor until it hits your price target, okay?"
"532620","536260"," And you can't stay in your price target if it's close enough."
"536780","537620"," Does that make sense?"
"538920","544780"," I want to make sure that that makes sense because there is a lot of pollution out there on the"
"544780","550220"," Internet telling you that, let's say we come down here, right?"
"550760","552360"," And we only got to this point. "
"552360","557740"," If we make this breakthrough here and start moving this way, there's a lot of people on the"
"557740","562480"," Internet that's going to tell you, well, you have to stay in that short because that's your thesis."
"563480","570080"," You, even though you have your thesis and your plan, have to always adjust to what's actually"
"570080","570660"," happening."
"571600","572660"," Be conscious of that. "
"573060","575000"," This is where people get burned."
"575480","576340"," They get burned here."
"576960","579300"," They get burned here, right?"
"579300","582580"," And bulls get burned up here, okay?"
"582640","587720"," So if we're bullish here right now, we know we're going up here right now, bulls can get burned"
"587720","593660"," here just like bears can get burned saying, we have to go to for a wait or you were wrong,"
"594160","595280"," okay?"
"595720","598560"," So I need you to understand that you always have to be nimble. "
"598980","601300"," You always have to be able to take profit."
"602060","609300"," And the last part is that if you're trading naked, calls, right, which is a bearish position here,"
"610640","618000"," if you're naked and you're single-holding diamond-handing anything this way, if you were diamond "
"618000","623280","-handing, if you come into my channel, you tell me that you're going up 500 points with just naked"
"623280","626280"," cotton, like, I'm not, you got something you guys don't understand my terminology."
"626780","627380"," So keep it simple. "
"627800","637360"," If you're just diamond-handing 500 Cs today until May, and we end up going up 300, 400 points, but"
"637360","640120"," then crash back down, I don't want to fucking hear you complaining."
"640920","641960"," You guys understand that?"
"642660","647460"," You guys need to have protection on."
"647860","649560"," You have to put the right risk on. "
"649700","651200"," You have to take profit in your trades."
"652360","653800"," You guys have to as traders."
"654520","655820"," I need you to understand that as we move forward. "
"656280","657400"," Now it's 921, okay?"
"659440","660680"," Congratulations to anybody."
"661600","662840"," That made money overnight."
"663280","669980"," I hope that nobody got caught yesterday in that short, because I know that short, right, looked"
"669980","671260"," great in the close. "
"671780","676080"," I remember that when we took that long position, Microsoft had already sold off."
"677100","683520"," Everything was pointing towards a market collapse overnight, but there were a few key indicators"
"683520","684500"," that we were looking at."
"685940","687340"," There's a few key indicators. "
"687340","691400"," For me, it was the $10 million in QQQ calls right before the bell."
"691960","692880"," It was a block trade."
"693360","693880"," It was long. "
"694320","695180"," It was very unusual."
"696200","697480"," Second problem that I had."
"698060","701340"," The initial numbers that came out were a hit on Microsoft. "
"702020","704000"," We didn't know what the guidance was at that point."
"704420","709940"," And then the severity of the sell-down yesterday, before the close, coupled with the severity of"
"709940","711680"," the selling-off."
"712000","715420"," And the first 10 minutes of that close at 4'10, 4'10"". "
"715420","717300"," I'm like, wow, we're down 2% to 3%."
"718740","724780"," And it hasn't even hit the spy or the cues yet how deep of a sell-off is infecting other"
"724780","727380"," single stocks, not just Amazon."
"728100","732180"," And you're talking about dropping the market, let's say, 3% to 5% overnight, and then where does it"
"732180","732820"," go at the bell?"
"733840","739340"," It was slightly concerning, because then you're talking about a drop of like 10% in overnight into"
"739340","739560"," FOMC. "
"740360","741460"," I just wasn't buying it."
"741980","743360"," And so it ended up taking the long."
"743360","745320"," And you had it showed yesterday in the chart. "
"745600","747700"," 1, 2, 3, right at the bell."
"747900","749940"," And we're going to rip this thing higher this morning, okay?"
"750480","751660"," Now we could rip this higher."
"751980","755460"," We could trade this higher off the bell this morning for the first 15 minutes, half an hour. "
"755740","756680"," We could trade this higher whenever."
"756880","759660"," I want you to pay attention to a rejection area here."
"759960","762140"," We're going to watch it this morning right off the bell. "
"762860","765160"," We could red bar it down to fakeout and move up."
"765580","770120"," But right off the bell this morning, I always urge you to take your profit off the table."
"770120","774140"," You can always re-enter a trade a second time and take this higher. "
"774380","776620"," You guys know that I'm famous for selling off the bell."
"777100","782180"," Even if I've bought a trade the night before, taking my profit is critical."
"782880","788380"," Nobody can ever yell at you for taking your profit from a trade, okay?"
"788760","790700"," No, you don't have to sit in a trade. "
"791260","797180"," You know, when I've made my 3,000% trades, 5,000% trades, it's not because I diamond handed"
"797180","798380"," for three weeks."
"798380","800580"," It's typically a trade that's overnight."
"800980","803140"," It's typically a trade that lasted just the day. "
"803620","809760"," It's never something that I've held for months on end, a position that's months on end, unless it"
"809760","815120"," has huge protection, unless it's stated fucking a year out, something crazy like that, right?"
"815500","819340"," But just not what you and I know we're talking about this morning, okay?"
"820140","823620"," You take profit, that stage is along the way re-enter the trade."
"824120","824760"," We do that with spreads."
"825140","826660"," We do it with any position that we're in. "
"826660","832560"," You have to actively manage, even if you're an investor, have price targets in mind for where"
"832560","837660"," you're looking to take profit, and then pullbacks re-enter that active investor trade, right?"
"837920","839320"," Even if you're an investor, you have to do that."
"839740","843000"," The banks manage their own investments the same way."
"843860","849620"," If a trade is not going your way, you should be nimble enough to be able to switch or to"
"849620","853620"," at least protect your positions if they're going the wrong way if you're going to ride them naked. "
"853620","858660"," If you're coming down this way, even on this, this applies for the upside."
"858940","863740"," If you're going down and we get a pullback, you should be able to even stay in your position, but"
"863740","868900"," take this long up here to cover any kind of problems that might take place down the road."
"869460","874460"," Had we not come back down here, you would have at least covered the position that you were in by"
"874460","879280"," going long, even if you're going to stay in your short going down this direction here, okay?"
"889420","890720"," All right, I'll check out my DM. "
"895340","899660"," So just be, I just want you guys to see what's happening off the bell this morning."
"899780","901220"," This is the critical thing you need to see."
"901820","904160"," I'm going to look at these levels down below here, right?"
"904560","909140"," You've got somewhere down here, 438, 434, 4265, right?"
"909800","910600"," This should be a little bit higher. "
"912220","913720"," At this, these move up every day."
"916200","917800"," I have a chance to adjust my."
"920380","923700"," I do want you to be aware though, if we reject at any point. "
"924780","925720"," Any bad news."
"927000","927800"," Any weakness."
"928520","932240"," So you might even see an FMC will travel the slavery might see some weakness for a ride higher,"
"932340","932660"," right?"
"933120","933720"," To blast through. "
"934480","940140"," If we reject, if we come above this, this area of resistance trail back down and come back down"
"940140","942600"," here, if like Friday, it could happen today."
"942620","943420"," It could happen next week."
"943860","948540"," There's a fair chance that we trade back down still into that 408-418. "
"949220","951920"," I want you to be aware of that as we trade into today."
"952360","954760"," I want you to always have this in the back of your mind, okay?"
"954860","957000"," A retest down below here."
"957620","960600"," Now as we trade higher, that lower number will come higher. "
"960820","964460"," It could go from 400 or so, 390 or so."
"965000","969920"," It could move, it will move up as we trade higher, but it's always a specter in the background that"

"995360","997260"," They showed they were willing to buy this market."
"997260","1003320"," And by them showing that to the bulls, the bulls have to, at that point, adjust. "
"1003760","1012480"," The bears have to adjust and realize that they are going to take it long, right?"
"1012860","1013600"," That's what they're going to do."

"1490290","1490610"," Oh, five. "

"1545170","1546110"," No doubt about it. "
"1547070","1551510"," Looks like the gig is up on nobody knowing that we can take the opposite side of the trade anymore."
"1552010","1552990"," I noticed all over."
"1553670","1556110"," I noticed that on Wall Street bets last night. "
"1556110","1557650"," I noticed it on Twitter."
"1557950","1561590"," Everybody's saying you just trade the opposite side of everybody is."
"1562410","1564070"," I'm thinking that the gig is out. "
"1564230","1568210"," Everybody knows that you trade the opposite side."
"1568410","1570050"," So that's concerning to me this morning."
"1570690","1574490"," Looks like you've got some support down below here at 436 17. "
"1577770","1579090"," Kind of a wonky place."
"1579350","1581250"," This is right where the bell close was."
"1581250","1584170"," For 36 17 or so. "
"1584910","1587210"," Look for a look for a support here."
"1591060","1592860"," What do I think about AMD long here."
"1594980","1599560"," Tera Tesla hero indicator is a little positive somehow green. "
"1599780","1600600"," Some are still green."
"1614380","1617100"," Well, as soon as this loads up, we're going to check on Tesla."
"1618500","1622320"," More spies calling are coming in this morning spy misfit. "
"1622820","1624560"," Hot has some calls coming in."
"1628060","1629560"," What are my thoughts on AMD?"
"1630320","1631800"," I love trading AMD."
"1632560","1635500"," It is one of the first tech stocks that I learned how to trade. "
"1636280","1637280"," Very long time ago."
"1641360","1643200"," If you want to know where I want to trade it from."
"1643340","1644780"," I want to trade it from 75 bucks. "
"1646000","1647640"," Do I think we get to $75."
"1648260","1649180"," I don't know."
"1650540","1654440"," Because even even here at 110 bucks, it is kind of cheap at this point. "
"1656880","1659680"," What I would rather do to trade at AMD."
"1660220","1664460"," The one thing about AMD Tuesday, typically if they have a good ER, they will trade up."
"1665020","1666140"," They've had some really good ones. "
"1669960","1671480"," But for an ER trade."
"1672860","1674820"," I would say that you trade the run up."
"1676380","1679080"," And get out before actual ER. "
"1682020","1684680"," One other thing you do is trade strangles."
"1684680","1687640"," I always like strangles on volatile tickers."
"1687760","1689000"," I like playing strangles on Tesla. "
"1691360","1693480"," Everybody trades strangles on Tesla."
"1694300","1697840"," So you can look up a strangles and trade a strangle on Tesla."
"1698000","1700000"," Even today, you can trade a strangle on Tesla still. "
"1707550","1710290"," So we talked yesterday or this morning before they open."
"1711730","1713870"," We've still got the sellers above up here."
"1714410","1716470"," They're all lined up right at 441. "
"1716470","1719290"," 0.71 yesterday."
"1719770","1721050"," They were down below at 440."
"1724010","1726470"," We talked about this and this number this morning. "
"1726930","1729890"," You've got some more sellers right here, 441."
"1730670","1732690"," Let's be conscious of these sellers above here."
"1733330","1735810"," Be conscious that bears are going to want to take a stand here. "
"1736270","1742410"," Be conscious that even if we break through that bears are going to want to reject this."
"1742410","1747750"," Even if it takes two weeks once the once earnings are the major earnings are done."
"1748250","1750830"," They want to see a retest down below. "
"1751230","1755730"," I don't blame them and technically we should retest the lows."
"1756890","1758350"," But we don't have to."
"1760010","1761410"," Always be open to that. "
"1763510","1764850"," We'll look at Tesla next."
"1782100","1784760"," The BOC rate decision is on deck 20 minutes."
"1784760","1786580"," Could be fireworks considering today's volume. "
"1787440","1788520"," Good morning, everybody."
"1790500","1792740"," Pizza on falling to the right price."
"1794280","1794840"," Zero. "
"1802180","1802740"," The."
"1805040","1807940"," We do have some puts coming in on pizza on this morning."
"1808560","1811180"," January 28th, 28 P."
"1812560","1814860"," Haven't even looked at on my own position here. "
"1815860","1817340"," They usually have a watch list up."
"1817480","1819620"," I haven't had the time to put my watch list up yet."
"1823400","1824460"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"1825540","1827340"," You know, I think I got to say something."
"1827500","1833320"," I think I'm going to diamond hand these puts right into their ER."
"1834880","1838220"," And the reason I'm going to diamond hand these puts into their ER is because I believe. "
"1839920","1841700"," It's it's the ethics of it."
"1842040","1845240"," It has to do with it's almost close to Nicola."
"1845620","1846280"," Like the N."
"1846720","1846740"," K."
"1846820","1849040"," L.A. It rubs me wrong. "
"1850000","1851480"," Nicola rubbed me wrong to."
"1852260","1856400"," Because they're not honest with their investors that don't like that dishonesty."
"1860720","1864200"," Yeah, I want to diamond hand these these these P time puts. "
"1865080","1865960"," I believe."
"1866860","1872260"," I wish I wish I was a little disturbed that they didn't just they were just weren't honest."
"1872980","1874540"," They didn't upgrade their ER. "
"1874900","1877540"," They knew about they knew about this a long time ago, right?"
"1878820","1881280"," They what they did was they sold out at the top."
"1881460","1882440"," They took all their money and ran."
"1883300","1884700"," First they did that, right?"
"1886820","1891760"," We have a calls coming in on CCL lots of airline calls off the bell this morning. "
"1891780","1895420"," Pay attention to jets pay attention to CCL."
"1896480","1897780"," I had a good morning."
"1901480","1905360"," Yeah, I wish companies were up. "
"1905520","1905860"," Me too."
"1906140","1907580"," Yeah, bothers even companies do that."
"1907780","1908300"," It's not a good. "
"1909040","1911600"," I don't like when they take the profit money and run."
"1911780","1913980"," But then once the other stuff started leaking out."
"1914500","1919160"," The fact that instead of instead of partnering up with a great bike company. "
"1919680","1921800"," We have some great bike companies in this country."
"1923060","1925040"," Great American made bike companies."
"1926660","1929300"," You could have teamed up with an outdoor bike company. "
"1929500","1930220"," I ride mountain bikes."
"1930400","1932380"," I used to ride more than I do now because I don't live in the mountains anymore."
"1932760","1935520"," But even in the summer still here in Michigan, I ride single track here. "
"1936040","1938880"," You know, I go out to the book map mountains out in Colorado."
"1939620","1941800"," I ride down in Southern Utah."
"1944240","1949280"," They could have they could have partnered up with a great American made bike manufacturer would"
"1949280","1950060"," have boomed the stock. "
"1950620","1952600"," Even if you had to wait two years for a bike."

"2014920","2017240"," That's the kind of flow that I want to see to get bullish."
"2018140","2020320"," That will impact Tesla today."
"2021060","2022320"," Whether you like it or not. "
"2023840","2026020"," That should make Tesla go up."

"2138460","2140460"," How are the price of these calls so expensive?"
"2142240","2143620"," Not only do I believe in Tesla."
"2144180","2144620"," But."
"2150680","2152880"," They've made me so much money. "
"2154320","2156800"," That I can give some I can give some money back to the cause."
"2158840","2160600"," I can give the cause back some money."
"2161340","2168260"," I don't mind paying back. "
"2169640","2170980"," But the cause gave me."
"2174800","2175420"," I'm down."
"2175620","2176640"," I'm down to place in Tesla. "
"2190040","2191720"," Let's play some Tesla this morning."
"2192580","2195280"," I'll put some I'll put some money back into the Tesla pot."
"2199950","2201670"," It's like pouring one out for homey. "
"2203770","2204890"," Why are you playing Tesla?"
"2205250","2207350"," Why are you buying calls on Tesla day before you are?"
"2208190","2210530"," Because they've made me so much money."
"2210930","2211350"," That's why."
"2213030","2213590"," That's why. "
"2220680","2221920"," That's why I'm playing some Tesla."
"2224460","2226080"," I'll throw a little bit of beer out there."
"2226080","2227600"," I'll tip style tip my 40. "
"2228340","2229800"," To Tesla gang today."
"2244940","2246320"," What is going on here?"
"2278250","2279010"," All right."
"2280330","2281090"," I'm in Tesla. "
"2281610","2282210"," There we go."
"2282950","2284130"," I am long Tesla."
"2285990","2286910"," Diamondhand baby. "
"2287890","2288630"," Let's trade this."
"2288850","2289830"," Let's trade it up today."
"2290110","2291190"," I haven't played Tesla in a while. "
"2292430","2292970"," We're in the middle."
"2292970","2295310"," We're in the middle on Tesla this morning."
"2296870","2299350"," I'm going to Diamondhand these bad boys into. "
"2299910","2301350"," I mean, dude, I'm holding."
"2301610","2303190"," I know my pitons in a print."
"2304590","2306730"," We have ER after the close today. "
"2306790","2307950"," We're probably going to sell it down."
"2308190","2310770"," Like some something crazy at like three forty five."
"2311270","2313190"," Just fall seventy ninety points. "
"2313190","2313810"," I don't care."
"2314590","2315410"," I don't care."
"2315650","2316770"," I'm going to Diamondhand them. "
"2317230","2320650"," And then if I have the dollar cost average in for that bell."
"2321670","2322690"," I'm going to do it."
"2324050","2326750"," I want to pay attention to the ER statement today. "
"2327190","2329910"," I want to listen to Elon Musk today."
"2331370","2334390"," I remember the last time that he was on his ER."
"2334650","2337910"," And I remember when they were there being all jerky towards them. "
"2338590","2341610"," A bunch of smart asses thinking they could talk shit to Elon."
"2342090","2344050"," Let's trip him up with big words."
"2345430","2346890"," Let's twist what he's saying. "
"2348350","2349790"," I was very upset."
"2349790","2351110"," At the time when it happened."
"2352470","2355790"," At the time when it happened, right?"
"2356870","2361110"," I was upset because Elon to me, right?"
"2361630","2364310"," It's the wrong place for him, right?"
"2364770","2366530"," I want him to be in a more controlled environment. "
"2367550","2369410"," I want him to always look good."
"2369890","2371070"," He should always look good."
"2371410","2373970"," He's the CEO of one of my favorite companies. "
"2375030","2376950"," You're not there to sabotage him."
"2380830","2382410"," So what do I think about that?"
"2382950","2383550"," I'll burn down."
"2383730","2385430"," I'll burn down a few grand for him today. "
"2385750","2388630"," The fact that he's going to come out today inside of his ER."
"2389250","2390270"," I want to hear him speak again."
"2390350","2394050"," It was the one, the saddest part was that I didn't get to hear him anymore in ER. "
"2394210","2395830"," I liked listening to him in ERs."
"2398110","2398890"," See, I'll trade."
"2398990","2400050"," I'll trade tassel today. "
"2400590","2402030"," I'll buy it at the wrong time today."
"2402970","2403630"," I don't care."
"2404430","2405130"," I made my bags. "
"2406290","2408630"," I can make bad trades if I want to now."
"2416360","2418000"," I'll drink the Kool-Aid today."
"2419260","2420000"," Bring it on. "
"2422820","2423620"," Tesla 1200."
"2424340","2425080"," That's what I want to see."
"2425440","2426780"," I want to see like Tesla 1200. "
"2427360","2428520"," I want to see something stupid."
"2429220","2429960"," Do I think it's going to happen?"
"2430280","2431340"," Probably not, but I don't care."
"2432440","2433060"," I'm long Tesla. "
"2435560","2436780"," I am long Tesla."
"2437220","2438140"," Diamond hands, baby."
"2444300","2445100"," Diamond hands. "
"2448380","2449700"," Hell yeah, I want to hear."
"2449860","2451500"," I want to hear my man Elon talk."
"2452020","2453200"," I love Elon Musk. "
"2453880","2455820"," And I don't like when they trip him up."
"2457600","2458040"," 1200."
"2458480","2459300"," That's what I want to see today. "
"2460620","2461060"," I'll do that."
"2461180","2462460"," So just so everybody knows, right?"
"2463460","2463700"," I died."
"2463900","2471000"," I held like $30,000 or some kind of some nonsense like that into the clothes where he announced the"
"2471000","2471800"," stock split. "
"2473280","2474400"," I was holding that."
"2474620","2475540"," I was holding that ER."
"2475540","2477900"," That man made me more money. "
"2479160","2481020"," It's the third best trade I've ever made."
"2481700","2482760"," In terms of pure profitability."
"2485120","2487300"," Third best trade I've ever made made in my career. "
"2487960","2488740"," I owe that man some money."
"2491120","2492980"," I do this every year for Tesla."
"2495620","2497720"," I don't care how irrational it is. "
"2508200","2509280"," I drive his cars."
"2511880","2516000"," I want to fund SpaceX, even if they say the companies are split."
"2517960","2519460"," I want to fund Neuralink. "
"2520140","2521900"," I want to see company X."
"2523220","2525720"," And it would be hilarious if they split the stock."
"2526320","2527280"," It would be hilarious."
"2537700","2539520"," So yeah, I'm all in. "
"2543520","2545480"," Did you just tell me that 1200?"
"2545480","2550200"," You just tell me that Tesla to 1200 is it's got like a 1% chance."
"2550800","2551960"," I like those odds."
"2552600","2556180"," I like those odds. "
"2562060","2563180"," I'll take them."
"2569190","2570450"," I'll take those odds."
"2570690","2572590"," I'll buy the dip blindly off the bell. "
"2577900","2578940"," I'll take them."
"2578940","2579480"," I'm in."
"2580740","2581500"," I'm pumped. "
"2582920","2585240"," Bulls have had anything to be happy about."
"2585380","2585580"," And what?"
"2586260","2586980"," Five weeks?"
"2589300","2590700"," I want to be happy today."
"2590980","2591900"," Can I be happy today?"
"2593940","2597460"," Can Papa Jay not be Papa polar bear?"
"2597780","2598320"," Yeah, maybe. "
"2599880","2601680"," Can he save the markets today?"
"2601900","2602000"," Maybe."
"2602280","2602660"," I don't care."
"2603660","2604780"," You want to care about?"
"2604940","2605440"," I want to be happy. "
"2605440","2608760"," I want to have a smile."
"2609080","2609500"," I don't want to be."
"2609620","2613380"," I don't want to be taking along and then getting my throat cut on the clothes. "
"2613920","2615500"," Like what happened on the last bounce."
"2616880","2618660"," I want to let it ride, baby."
"2621920","2629550"," Oh, look at that. "
"2629770","2631490"," Hot calls already printing at this point."
"2637990","2639870"," Don't buy 1200 C's."
"2642110","2643870"," They're safer trades on Tesla. "
"2649320","2652000"," Spy is up to 442 right here."
"2652240","2652560"," Woohoo."
"2654240","2656580"," So this is a major resistance point on the spy. "
"2657720","2661320"," Now, originally we had a lot of, it was higher."
"2661920","2663700"," It was supposed to go to 450 and 455."
"2664580","2666720"," But the resistance channel has come down. "
"2669620","2674700"," So we might trade up to 442."
"2674700","2681360"," If we are able to, if we're able to squeeze shorts here though, there is a chance that we could"
"2681360","2683740"," have a face repair rally today."
"2686620","2690280"," So I might think about, think about, I want to see if we rest here. "
"2691060","2692240"," See where we are right here."
"2693420","2697040"," I'd like to see if we rest above here and then maybe take this long."
"2697900","2699640"," If we are able to break above 440. "
"2701780","2703260"," 442, this whole area here."
"2704360","2709020"," There could be a nice chance of a squeeze play coming up."
"2711640","2713720"," This is a major area of contention. "
"2716380","2718600"," I'm not even looking at the Tesla chart right now."
"2718820","2719320"," I don't even care."
"2719420","2720040"," I'm just going to hold them. "
"2723080","2723560"," Careless."
"2731440","2732500"," Place my trade."
"2734280","2735960"," Don't care if they burned a zero. "
"2738840","2740700"," Yes, we'll see if we get a rejection here."
"2740820","2742900"," This is a point where bears will step in."
"2743380","2744940"," They'll lay back into their shorts. "
"2747160","2750860"," What you are looking for here though is you are looking for."
"2753260","2754540"," You're looking for two things."
"2755200","2758360"," You're looking for the conviction of bulls saying, nope. "
"2759280","2760140"," We're going to take this higher."
"2765700","2768780"," You're looking for, do the bears actually show up?"
"2769560","2772000"," Or at this point, are they going to take their money and run?"
"2773560","2777700"," You're also looking to see if we trade sideways at this point until the Fed meeting."
"2778880","2782820"," We talked this week about, do we think that the Fed is hawkish?"
"2782900","2783620"," Do we think he's bullish?"
"2784680","2788800"," I think for where we are right now, I think for where the banks are showing us. "
"2788800","2791780"," The banks kind of showed us their cards last night."
"2792580","2794200"," They were willing to buy this market."
"2795500","2801100"," Even if we trade it down to 400 or 390, when those bulls stepped in and bought misfit yesterday,"
"2801100","2806640"," when they bought Microsoft, when they stepped in and bought all these companies yesterday that went"
"2806640","2807560"," down with it. "
"2807900","2811660"," Even though the market was on a knife's edge, they showed their cards."
"2812360","2815200"," They showed that there was a bottom that they were willing to buy."
"2816060","2822400"," They showed that no matter what, if the market was to panic, they had the algo set to buy. "
"2823520","2828940"," When they showed that buy, the willingness to buy, that was something that you have to pay"
"2828940","2833600"," attention to, because what they would have done, you've seen this in the past, you saw it on Snap,"
"2834140","2835560"," you saw it on Facebook."
"2836780","2838200"," Remember the knee jerk reactions?"
"2839000","2840920"," They were just looking for a reason to sell Facebook, right?"
"2841260","2843360"," Remember, looking for a reason to sell it."
"2843360","2845180"," Didn't matter if the news stuck. "
"2845600","2847220"," Didn't matter if the news was real."
"2847900","2850000"," And they never went back and rebought right away."
"2850200","2853320"," Matter of fact, they waited like weeks to buy rebought Facebook again. "
"2855100","2860120"," So when you saw our company yesterday, you saw all of Big Tech yesterday have a number where they"
"2860120","2860940"," got bought yesterday."
"2861500","2866160"," It was key to see that because it shows that the banks are committed to this market."
"2866320","2868100"," They just want to be in lower than you. "
"2870320","2872320"," So there is bottom to this market."
"2872320","2877020"," That is a quiver for bulls, and that can't be denied at this point."
"2878480","2881200"," But the banks are willing to buy it when you're not willing to buy it. "
"2892740","2899740"," Watching WFC come in, calls on WFC, January 28th, 53C for 119,000."
"2900080","2900660"," I don't like that."
"2900820","2901400"," I don't like those calls. "
"2902380","2903320"," We can't even set those calls."
"2903320","2907600"," I like how HAL."
"2909520","2911220"," June 17th, 40C. "
"2911660","2912820"," I like how the date on it."
"2913420","2915640"," A little bit of time on there, right?"
"2916140","2917960"," Just June 17th, 40C."
"2919540","2923780"," I see a lot of calls coming in on the banks. "
"2924060","2925160"," They've been doing it for two days now."
"2925680","2931340"," Just lots of flow on banks in anticipation of the Fed meeting today."
"2944800","2946040"," It's a big one for an $85 stock. "
"2946040","2955100"," We have calls coming in on ARCH, ARCH, February 18, 85C for $842,000."
"2955940","2958240"," That's a big one for an $85 stock."
"2959580","2962860"," We have RDS. "
"2964460","2966100"," Forward slash B."
"2968180","2970460"," RDS forward slash B."
"2970960","2980840"," It's $700,000 on February 18th, 52.5. More calls stacking up on the"
"2980840","2981080"," queues."
"2982140","2983080"," We have just see it."
"2983180","2988320"," Just so you know, we have we're stacking calls on the queues right now. "
"2988320","2992220"," If you don't want to trade an individual ticker in the queues, right?"
"2993300","2995940"," Well, is Apple going to do this thing?"
"2997840","2999700"," Is AMD going to do its thing?"
"3000600","3002660"," Is this company going to do its thing?"
"3003160","3004220"," Is Tesla going to do its thing?"
"3004600","3009860"," If you just trade the queues, you can take the average, right?"
"3010480","3014940"," Typically, you'll see 70% of big tech have a great ER."
"3015940","3016840"," The great ER."
"3017640","3019620"," So let's say you pick the wrong ticker. "
"3020240","3021900"," For tech, you just buy some queues."
"3022960","3025800"," The safest way to play tech earnings is the queues."
"3029620","3032900"," XLV calls January 28th, 128C. "
"3033740","3035540"," Oh, look at my burr on Tesla."
"3036580","3038420"," Oh, yeah, look at that burr on Tesla."
"3039280","3040860"," Burr, Tesla, burr. "
"3042740","3043940"," Give me that Tesla."

"4864620","4865880"," February 18th, 80C."
"4866800","4871520"," And then at some point today, I'm going to buy."
"4871520","4875520"," I might even buy it right now. "
"4875900","4878580"," I'm going to buy some 450C on the spy."
"4883320","4886220"," You might even go higher just in case, right?"
"4886940","4888240"," Just in case."
"4888700","4889900"," I'm going to buy something stupid. "
"4892920","4894640"," Something way outside of the money."
"4901180","4904440"," You see 480, 457."
"4905280","4911140"," Look at something far, far away. "
"4912500","4915800"," Let's look at spy."
"4917340","4919220"," Put some time on it."

"4983960","5003350"," All right."
"5004090","5010220"," A whole bunch of stupid outside the money's shit down the road."
"5010520","5011220"," Four months from now. "
"5012340","5013180"," Gonna throw."
"5015780","5017420"," That's a bunch of outside the money."
"5017520","5018000"," Crazy stuff. "

"5050100","5051920"," Doesn't even matter if we trade down to 400."
"5057580","5061760"," Just a bunch of lotos with date with time on them. "
"5061760","5062600"," Four months."
"5062680","5063280"," Not three, four months."
"5063420","5064080"," Three month lotos. "
"5071100","5072580"," We get that data trade."
"5087040","5087780"," All right."
"5091850","5094330"," We'll talk about those again for like two months. "
"5094370","5095450"," We'll come back to those."
"5118570","5122390"," Have some puts coming in on CMCSA."

"5162280","5164000"," 476,000 dollars."
"5167320","5168020"," Excuse me."
"5169300","5171480"," My throat hurts today from all this talking. "
"5178160","5180180"," There's some February calls out there."
"5180640","5185020"," Hopefully I can trade that trade for small caps coming out in the next two, three weeks."
"5185520","5186620"," We'll let those ripen up. "
"5187640","5190000"," And I've got some calls on the Spy for April."
"5192000","5199100"," I've got some day trades on Tesla because I want to be vested heading into the ER statement today."
"5205780","5207380"," Bears are going to load up here. "
"5207500","5208120"," We already know this."
"5208220","5211380"," We talked about this yesterday at that 440 level."
"5211880","5213900"," You've got a boatload of shorts. "
"5214600","5220340"," You've got a boatload of sellers that are panicking above from here at this point, right?"
"5221800","5228760"," So they're going to start loading the boat here for this thesis that we go back down to that 408,"
"5229100","5230360"," 418 level."
"5231400","5234080"," But I think that there's two things going on."
"5234400","5239840"," You're going to see the market trade sideways into the FOMC meeting and statement later today. "
"5241040","5242500"," You've got some heavy hitters."
"5243160","5245040"," They're going to report today and tomorrow."
"5247500","5253300"," You've got this thought that we're going to head down to 408 and 419. "
"5253300","5256560"," And I still agree with this, but I don't think it happens."
"5257260","5259080"," I don't think it happens today."
"5261540","5263320"," And we have one other thing happening. "
"5263320","5266580"," And that is there's a ton of puts rolling off this market."
"5267120","5269320"," Short dated puts that are rolling off this market."
"5269320","5279300"," And if bears don't keep reloading, just keep adding and this morning, you know what I"
"5279300","5279800"," haven't seen. "
"5280200","5282020"," I haven't seen any put hedging."
"5282980","5285040"," All I've seen is just retail."
"5286020","5287080"," Retail bears. "
"5287280","5288100"," That's all I see today."
"5290360","5294180"," The bullish indicator this morning, 93%."
"5294760","5299160"," Haven't seen that in a dog's age in a month. "
"5303520","5304640"," Put to call ratio."
"5306060","5307040"," Five to one."
"5307560","5308320"," No more now. "
"5308640","5309560"," It's a one."
"5309740","5310560"," It's six to one."
"5312000","5312820"," On calls. "
"5317460","5319520"," Six to one on calls this morning."
"5324370","5325750"," So you know what the bulls are saying?"
"5326270","5327250"," I don't believe you."
"5331150","5333330"," The bulls are saying, you know, Captain Jim?"
"5334030","5336290"," We could have went down there, but we're going to go up first. "
"5344650","5347650"," So if they're saying we're going up, I'll throw you some money."
"5349190","5350990"," They haven't really said we're going up."
"5352350","5353150"," In a month. "
"5354990","5356770"," You have the snap snapback trade."
"5358270","5360350"," But this is at this time it is different."
"5364190","5365850"," So everything is stacking up. "
"5368110","5369750"," Against the bears this morning."
"5370190","5371210"," Doesn't matter where we trade."
"5372110","5374030"," Doesn't matter if shorts are stepping in. "
"5374290","5376310"," Doesn't matter if the bears are there in the background."
"5377390","5381370"," What matters is that there's a sentiment change, even if they're not telling you this in the"
"5381370","5381690"," market."
"5384610","5386950"," I want you to know that there was a sentiment change. "
"5387190","5391790"," I want you to know, even if we trade down for a moment, even if we have this moment where"
"5391790","5396650"," a short operation comes out and drops the market briefly so they can get a better position."
"5397750","5401990"," That there is somewhat of a sentiment change in this market."
"5404010","5406170"," I know that most of you felt it yesterday. "
"5407190","5408110"," Hands down."
"5408370","5409210"," There was a sentiment change."
"5409830","5415150"," Now we've got calls coming out on posh 318 117.5 C."
"5417430","5424010"," We've got calls coming out spy January 26 for 39 C for $168,000. "
"5424690","5434630"," Two sets of block trades on docks D O C S May 20 45 C for almost almost $400,000."
"5436710","5444730"," Lots of bid coming in for small and mid caps heading into their season after being beaten down for"
"5444730","5445470"," an entire month."
"5456820","5459720"," Let's look above to see where the sellers are in our case. "
"5459940","5462520"," We know that firm support is building at 70 bucks."
"5463200","5467940"," We know that the banks stepped in at 65 even if they're lying to you."
"5468300","5469280"," We know they did, right?"
"5470160","5471340"," Almost to the pin. "
"5473020","5474520"," They bought it right here."
"5475340","5477360"," We have new support at 70."
"5477820","5482540"," These are probably new bulls stepping in saying, Hey, can you come back down so I don't miss the"
"5482540","5482780"," boat. "
"5484060","5485520"," I want to fomo in."
"5491040","5492820"," Doesn't matter what the technicals are."
"5493280","5494120"," Doesn't matter. "
"5494540","5495520"," None of this matter."
"5495520","5497580"," It only matters is that people are buying it."
"5500260","5504880"," Price target above 80 bucks light resistance at 75 and 77. "
"5505640","5507500"," These sellers right here gone."
"5510520","5513260"," I like to see price targets above on tickers."
"5513260","5514500"," We talk about this every day, right?"
"5515020","5520380"," When I only see black and light blue above means that there's no interest. "
"5521080","5525260"," When you start to see price targets above like this, there is now interest."
"5529290","5530990"," It's one small thing."
"5536430","5538370"," Let's see if the. "
"5540090","5541650"," Hero indicator tells us anything."
"5541730","5543450"," If there is even one for."
"5545450","5545970"," Okay. "
"5548990","5550810"," Haven't seen any interest in our K."
"5551570","5553610"," Other than the banks buying that dip."
"5553610","5555570"," I didn't see anything come through."
"5558970","5564290"," Watching calls on SLB, $39 ticker, January 28. "
"5565150","5566430"," $34,000."
"5567010","5567770"," It's an energy trade."
"5569390","5575950"," Calls on JNPR January 28, 32 C for $235,000. "
"5576510","5578470"," So like some of these tickers you could take."
"5579530","5584690"," Some of them have nice long dates in these calls, but what are you really looking for?"
"5586090","5590410"," You're really looking for where is the concentration of calls this morning."
"5590930","5592310"," It's all on small and mid caps. "
"5593030","5597270"," They're all betting down the road that they're going to be some good reports."
"5598270","5599530"," On small caps."
"5601110","5604870"," So if you want to take a safer bet, that's probably an IWM. "
"5605070","5606250"," It's probably an I RK."
"5620300","5622660"," 73 22 in our K."
"5623500","5626340"," 65 point 18 on our K."
"5627140","5629280"," 60 point 29 on our K."
"5629820","5631820"," Those are your three support levels."
"5632420","5633460"," Your price targets above. "
"5641040","5641880"," 76."
"5643920","5644760"," 82."
"5645660","5646380"," 89. "
"5649240","5649540"," 99."
"5662380","5667920"," We'll look at spy and then we'll look at IWM and we'll take a look at Tesla thereafter."
"5685440","5691760"," The cashback gap bill is somewhere at 434 17 on spy. "
"5697150","5697990"," Have that right?"
"5698210","5698390"," Hold on."
"5699070","5699470"," Yeah, 430."
"5700250","5700630"," Let me take a look. "
"5701010","5703050"," I didn't see what the close was yesterday."
"5705030","5706030"," 434 56."
"5706770","5708430"," So we'll take a look at 434 56. "
"5708430","5711670"," See if there's a gap filled to be had."
"5724000","5730880"," And I'm going to be looking to make entry today for the FOMC meeting somewhere for FDS at some"
"5730880","5731560"," point today."
"5732400","5738120"," I'm going to wait for just before usually wait for about 1 30 in the afternoon. "
"5738900","5744760"," 1 o'clock sometimes it seems like I used to wait till 1 30 and then last minutes."
"5744760","5746860"," That's FOMC minutes."
"5747720","5752960"," It seemed like people were loading up before it was like 1 p.m. So maybe like 12 o'clock"
"5752960","5753280"," today. "
"5753700","5756620"," We're going to look for which side everybody's on."
"5758140","5760260"," You can see if everybody is long or short."
"5761280","5762560"," This FOMC meeting. "
"5763620","5765220"," See where all the weight is."
"5765540","5766720"," See what costs the most."
"5767520","5770160"," And then we'll take a straddle on the spy. "
"5772960","5774540"," So we can trade both directions."
"5775020","5778420"," We'll cut one side loose and we'll stay on the other side that prints."
"5791820","5793080"," So we'll look at that. "
"5793280","5794200"," We're going to check back."
"5794280","5795440"," We're going to look at the spy right now."
"5795520","5797860"," We're going to take a look at it right around 12 o'clock. "
"5798360","5805320"," If we don't see anything shaping up at 12, we'll take a look at it at 1 p.m. And"
"5805320","5807460"," if we have to wait until 1 30, we will."
"5808220","5810440"," There is one word of caution on FOMC."
"5811420","5813580"," Especially the meeting itself. "
"5814820","5817040"," Is you might hear really great news."
"5818400","5820140"," Or let's say you hear really bad news."
"5821320","5824080"," Then later on when he's being interviewed. "
"5825700","5827620"," You'll hear negative or positive come out."
"5827680","5829960"," So let's say he's positive and he's super dovish."
"5831720","5837100"," Then inside of his question and answer, you'll hear really negative stuff come out. "
"5837460","5841060"," And you'll sometimes see weakness for a brief moment and then we rock it up."
"5841540","5843580"," Or you'll see us rock it up."
"5844680","5845660"," And then come back down. "
"5845980","5849360"," So be conscious of that as we head into FOMC today."
"5850240","5853260"," That the real moves start happening later on."
"5854140","5855520"," Typically not always, but typically. "
"5859560","5861770"," So timing is key today on FOMC."
"5879130","5882750"," Found some buyers here at 437.25 on the spy."
"5885330","5890730"," We're going to look a little bit closer and see if that 434 is still viable or not. "
"5892230","5894150"," If we will trade down to that 434."
"5898810","5900670"," See if this is where the banks are."
"5902110","5903650"," You have this level right here, right?"
"5903770","5904750"," You can see it right here. "
"5905350","5908910"," 437.58. Large buyers stepping in."
"5909430","5912410"," 437.13 or so."
"5913030","5913810"," See this right here. "
"5918470","5918990"," 436."
"5919710","5920090"," 435."
"5921110","5922410"," Looks slightly lower. "
"5932160","5937260"," Looks like some major support set setting up here at this 434 level."
"5937400","5938680"," If you want to take less risk."
"5940260","5944440"," Look for a price target at some point today on the spy at 434. "
"5951310","5952510"," Let's say we sell below."
"5952730","5953990"," Let's say we sell the market today."
"5955030","5956310"," Let's look to see where they are. "
"5958470","5959590"," That's positive."
"5959830","5960490"," I like seeing that."
"5962930","5964530"," Right down here at 430. "
"5965950","5966890"," Heavy support."
"5967550","5969370"," The seat over here on the right hand side."
"5976010","5977770"," 427 would be another target. "
"5978530","5991040"," 427.09. One"
"5991040","5996660"," of my favorite parts of this market is it is a forward looking market."
"5997160","5997640"," Usually."
"5997640","6002240"," So once the FOMC down here, 420. "
"6003500","6005740"," I'm revisiting this a long time ago."
"6006400","6009260"," What I like about this market is once the dirty laundry is out."
"6010320","6012000"," Typically gets more bullish again. "
"6012920","6013400"," 418."
"6013700","6015040"," We'll look below at that 418 number."
"6015280","6017940"," See if there's still down below at the 400. "
"6019140","6020200"," Or if they've come up."
"6024010","6025230"," 415 lots of buyers."
"6031080","6031520"," 410. "
"6033780","6036220"," It doesn't look like anybody's planning to be lower than this."
"6038260","6040280"," Yeah, this for a way looks like an area."
"6042680","6044080"," Let's go back to the top here. "
"6045100","6047260"," We'll see if there's anything firm enough above."
"6051290","6052970"," We're going to look above here and see."
"6054930","6056770"," Or below VWAP right now. "
"6057110","6058910"," Nice place to buy below VWAP."
"6059410","6063330"," We're going to look above and see outside of the shorting of them."
"6063430","6064630"," The act of shorting of the markets. "
"6068860","6069380"," 443."
"6071100","6073700"," I want to assume these sellers will come down to 443."
"6081660","6082180"," 447. "
"6082820","6084440"," These are really big resistance areas."
"6085300","6086900"," We're looking for bigger redder lines."
"6089480","6090340"," What is that?"
"6090460","6090820"," 447. "
"6096110","6096750"," 446."
"6097270","6097390"," 94."
"6100110","6102930"," Let's see what the banks originally got in way above. "
"6104430","6106290"," Lots of traffic to get up here."
"6109990","6110630"," 455."
"6112850","6113110"," Of note. "
"6115030","6115950"," It's like higher."
"6125580","6126140"," 461."
"6126700","6127580"," 30 is of note. "
"6133760","6135160"," There's a big note right there."
"6136600","6138420"," There's a big squeeze area up here."
"6138840","6139400"," 460s. "
"6144410","6147110"," See where the big boys are short."
"6151410","6152550"," Look at that 480."
"6155970","6157110"," Right up here. "
"6157570","6158190"," See that right there?"
"6159810","6160730"," There they are."
"6164400","6164960"," 475."
"6174360","6175760"," Just hide and not above. "
"6176500","6177500"," And there it is right there."
"6178340","6180240"," This is the magic sauce right here."
"6183660","6189060"," 479.89. Big daddy right here. "
"6199170","6201590"," The VWAP trader is stepping in right now in the spot."
"6202910","6214110"," A little"
"6214110","6215130"," more granular here."
"6220860","6226680"," Alright, let's look at some other stuff coming in right now. "
"6226680","6229420"," We've got bears stepping in with call with put flow."
"6229920","6231660"," Still not of any structure though."
"6232200","6237780"," In past days, we're seeing spy puts right down to 435, 439, 440. "
"6238560","6241440"," But all like $100,000, $200,000."
"6242600","6244380"," They don't have the same."
"6245260","6246940"," It's not like a 3140. "
"6247480","6248960"," It's not like three sets of 140."
"6249320","6251140"," They're all different prices."
"6252470","6253820"," They have low algo scores. "
"6257570","6259970"," So January 26, right?"
"6260070","6261730"," These are all short dated just for today."
"6262510","6265490"," January 26, 435 P."
"6267550","6268610"," 439 P."
"6268890","6269390"," 440 P."
"6269650","6270430"," Only dated for today."
"6272110","6274950"," No, no hedging coming in right now that I can see. "
"6276030","6278410"," But I do see calls on JNPR."
"6280090","6284490"," January 28, 32 C for $325,000."
"6285390","6287010"," I see calls on mid fit misfit. "
"6288590","6292850"," Which is MSFT Microsoft February 18, 310 C."
"6294130","6296670"," February 18 for $300,000."
"6298220","6301930"," Calls on SQ with a high algo score January 28, 130 C."
"6307650","6315550"," More calls on SQ both of high algo scores both at that same strike and date one January 28, 130"
"6315550","6315970"," C."
"6318070","6320110"," Seeing some heavy puts on DKNG."
"6321710","6323490"," February 4, 21 P."
"6323970","6328490"," Seeing some puts on Neo January 28, 23 P, but it's it's small money. "
"6328630","6329470"," It's like 34 grand."
"6330210","6334270"," But DKNG have got three sets for some significant money money."
"6334590","6335890"," Almost $300,000. "
"6337010","6340170"," That's pretty big for DKNG being a $21 ticker."
"6341150","6348850"," See QQQ's February 28, 330 P for $500,000."
"6350150","6356470"," Seeing racks of spy come out right now spy January 26 that's data for today. "
"6356770","6357550"," 439 C."
"6359090","6363890"," January 26, 439 C for about $600,000."
"6365070","6373050"," Seeing puts come in on the cues January 28, 330 P for $500,000."
"6373610","6379270"," Beyond calls February 11, 75 C for $75,000. "
"6380490","6385570"," Have bears in full rage mode right now full rage mode."
"6385570","6393380"," They just placed QQQ's February 28, 330 P for $674,000."
"6394410","6403490"," The spy is squeezing just as spy February 28, 415 P comes in for $1.3 million. "
"6405010","6405990"," They're double doubting."
"6406350","6410350"," They're saying that it doesn't matter what you do in the next three to four days."
"6410770","6414930"," It doesn't matter if you trade up on a short squeeze into the next few days. "
"6415390","6420890"," If you tag up there at 450 or 440 or whatever it is, 446, we're still going down."
"6422690","6424070"," So they're doubling down."
"6426910","6429090"," They're saying no way this market goes higher. "
"6430310","6432970"," And technically we should go down and retest one more time."
"6433070","6439990"," I can't say that we don't retest one more time at this point, but we do know that every once"
"6439990","6441990"," in a rare while we will not."
"6443830","6445970"," Sometimes you are on the wrong side of the trade. "
"6447910","6457550"," You might see that"
"6457550","6463170"," hedging activity slightly impact the market right now, but you still have call flow coming in, not"
"6463170","6464530"," call hedges, but call flow."
"6465150","6468430"," So you have spy 228, 415 P that just came in, right?"
"6469210","6472890"," That's a hedge, but then you have well, it's a sweep."
"6473210","6473930"," I shouldn't say it's a hedge. "
"6474050","6480370"," It's a sweep, but to say that, but as that comes in, someone just bought a bunch of spy calls"
"6480370","6481230"," dated for today."
"6484510","6487390"," So you're going to see a wash at some extent on this stuff."
"6500920","6506280"," More calls on spy data for today, 443 C, $132,000. "
"6508460","6509740"," So we have Tesla next."
"6514080","6515980"," Let me close out the spy."
"6516640","6517200"," I can leave that one. "
"6518420","6519340"," There you go."
"6526310","6527170"," Better's market."
"6532100","6540540"," DXJ 819 22 DXJ 65 C $177,000. "
"6540760","6543560"," Nice long dated trade in to August."
"6545600","6549760"," Snap January 28th, 33 C for $13,000."
"6550360","6552000"," Let Tesla load. "
"6566710","6569990"," I've got calls out there for the spy in April."
"6570770","6577210"," I've got calls out there for RK in February, and I'm holding Tesla into the close today."
"6577750","6581210"," I could care less where Tesla trades at this point. "
"6582590","6584470"," I'll hold them, diamond handed them."
"6584670","6587170"," I'll let them burn to the ground, like a care less."
"6592700","6595120"," That's my donation to big old pop a pump. "
"6596400","6598840"," My donation to Papa Elon Musk."
"6603740","6605500"," I don't believe the bears today."
"6608680","6610340"," I don't care about the spookiness. "
"6610920","6612840"," I don't care if they burned down to zero."
"6613400","6617120"," I made my bank yesterday to get to do whatever I want with it."
"6621230","6622750"," And I'm betting the other way today. "
"6624210","6625910"," I'm betting against the bears today."
"6626970","6627970"," One whole month."
"6629270","6632330"," Haven't seen bullishness like this in one whole month. "
"6632790","6635190"," Even in that snapback, I didn't see this bullishness."
"6637050","6638290"," I see bullish today."
"6640570","6641810"," I'll take that risk on. "
"6643210","6646370"," I want to hear what the old man has to say today after the bell."
"6653090","6654570"," I'm going to roll the dice today."
"6656850","6658370"," I can because I won. "
"6675390","6676150"," What's going on?"
"6676510","6677170"," I missed a bunch of stuff."
"6677350","6678930"," I wasn't reading anything you guys are talking about."
"6683540","6684460"," Did I miss something?"
"6691280","6692000"," Thank you, Johnny. "
"6692180","6692880"," For the information."
"6693000","6696000"," I wasn't paying attention to the feed and I wasn't paying attention to news."
"6697080","6700240"," I was just looking at all the call structure and the put structure this morning. "
"6706470","6707810"," Yeah, I don't have to be careful today."
"6708970","6710430"," I made so much money."
"6712950","6715170"," We got some weird shit going on my feed today, too. "
"6716510","6719450"," I don't know what's going on with it, but I got some weird stuff going on my feed today."
"6721830","6722370"," I didn't."
"6722450","6722530"," Yeah. "
"6722650","6723910"," Thanks, Johnny, for putting that out there."
"6724790","6726430"," What was going on in the feed over here?"
"6731710","6732250"," Yeah, man."
"6732330","6733210"," I don't care mode today. "
"6734010","6735830"," I'm going to believe the bulls for a moment."
"6736290","6741070"," No matter what the flow is saying is the flow is even though we're trading sideways right now."
"6741170","6747110"," It is to be expected for FOMC, but I'm going to I'm going to take the bull chance today. "
"6749230","6750990"," I got mostly long dated calls."
"6751730","6753210"," If they burn, they burn."
"6753390","6753710"," I don't care. "
"6754090","6754910"," I just don't."
"6755710","6756750"," I did well."
"6758330","6763090"," This is the first shift I've seen in sentiment a month real shift in sentiment. "
"6764250","6765770"," So I'll take that risk."
"6767890","6776810"," I'll throw on some I'll throw on some F D's at some point on IWM and the spy."
"6778210","6779510"," With some protection. "
"6780570","6785570"," As we get closer to FOMC today, the only thing that I'm just buying blindly is Tesla."
"6786290","6789410"," I owe Tesla that yet when I say Tesla's made me money."
"6790750","6792170"," You wouldn't believe me. "
"6794170","6798310"," It would be an insult to some people out there to know how much money I've made from Tesla."
"6798890","6800670"," So I'm not going to."
"6801450","6805570"," I'm not going to even entertain not not putting my tip or my tip cup. "
"6805830","6806890"," My what would you call it?"
"6807090","6809130"," Tithing like my tithing the Tesla."
"6809590","6810850"," I'm going to give my tithing the Tesla."
"6812190","6813930"," I'm going to give it every ER. "
"6815490","6816870"," Until an old man dead."
"6818550","6819610"," It's like going to church."
"6820550","6821370"," You got to pay it. "
"6822390","6823530"," You don't have a choice."
"6827900","6830800"," I don't care if Gary Black sells calls on ERs."
"6833340","6836960"," I relish that one ER that comes by every once in a while. "
"6838300","6840140"," We're at moon shots 300 points."
"6843180","6844640"," And every time it's done that."
"6845360","6847060"," It's been a memory in my brain. "
"6848380","6849100"," I'll never forget."
"6851620","6856280"," I'll trade it and lose it 10 times and still take that risk on Tesla on ER."
"6859870","6861170"," Paying the Tesla tax. "
"6864510","6867510"," Oh, I forgot Gary doesn't sell CCZ our week."
"6868510","6870670"," Yeah, I know all the rules on Tesla."
"6871210","6871950"," I don't care. "
"6876370","6878750"," Johnny Rebs like I'm trading with my emotions today."
"6880830","6882770"," I'm not trading my whole account on Tesla."
"6883670","6884530"," But I made some money. "
"6885210","6886570"," So yeah, I'm going to pay the Tesla gods."
"6889790","6890890"," I'm going to pay to play."
"6891530","6892550"," I'm going to take a leap of faith. "
"6895310","6896110"," I got it."
"6896610","6897370"," I've done it before."
"6899550","6901150"," It feels good doing it. "
"6901830","6903490"," Especially what you know what this feeling is?"
"6904130","6907230"," It's that feeling where you say I can lose this money."
"6909790","6911910"," I don't care if it burns to the ground."
"6918560","6920640"," It's like you're sitting at a poker table today. "
"6922520","6924800"," And there's like 10 bears at the poker table."
"6926100","6928820"," And I'm super bearish right now and I go, you know what?"
"6929440","6931020"," I ain't believing the bears today."
"6932740","6934220"," Today I don't believe them. "
"6942610","6945610"," I didn't believe the bulls the other day in that snapback play either."
"6946250","6946610"," At all."
"6950800","6954220"," We closed our calls at the end of the day on that snapback trade. "
"6955600","6957080"," And I know a ton didn't."
"6957420","6958740"," Today I don't believe the bears."
"6961260","6962600"," And I can be wrong. "
"6962900","6963700"," That's fine if I'm wrong."
"6966340","6968740"," But I just printed enough that I can be wrong today."
"6976940","6978420"," Yeah, it's that fuck you money. "
"6978840","6979260"," Exactly."
"6982620","6984480"," Only a few followed me yesterday."
"6987300","6989500"," I closed my calls at the bell today. "
"6989740","6991100"," I told you what I was doing."
"6993420","6994960"," I took my money and ran."
"6995680","6997820"," So now I'm going to pass some of it away. "
"7002240","7004820"," I'm going to donate to the bull jar today."
"7006020","7007460"," Donate some love to the bulls."
"7008400","7011080"," They've got no love for me for a month. "
"7012320","7013140"," There you go."
"7013280","7013780"," There's my love."
"7015000","7016680"," There's my love for the bulls today. "
"7018140","7019300"," Money in the tip jar."
"7019300","7022260"," The tithing jar."
"7022500","7023440"," I'm tithing the bulls. "
"7024120","7025460"," I'm tithing Elon Musk."
"7030180","7032580"," Straight wrecked our cave for an entire year."
"7033520","7037100"," We've literally abused our K for an entire year. "
"7037820","7038760"," I'll throw her some money."
"7039260","7040060"," She can have some money."
"7043830","7046490"," No problem tithing money today to the to the bulls. "
"7051330","7056660"," Yeah, what's the Tesla play?"
"7056660","7058100"," Do you want to know the real Tesla play?"
"7060860","7062840"," I've said what trades I placed today."
"7062880","7064340"," I've said them three times, four times."
"7065540","7066840"," I'm not going to keep repeating them. "
"7068260","7071940"," But I have, if you go back in the video, I've talked to every trade that I've made today."
"7079550","7081010"," Show up on time in the morning."
"7082210","7083590"," Be here every single morning. "
"7086550","7087250"," Oh, you're late."
"7089050","7091430"," I'm on some Tesla FDs."
"7094260","7095430"," Aspiring on the 28th. "
"7095570","7098030"," If you want to know how to trade Tesla, trade it with a strangle."
"7098610","7100030"," If no one's ever told you that."
"7101330","7104070"," Always trade Tesla ERs on a strangle. "
"7107290","7114310"," I'm on some February 18th, 80 C's for RK."
"7116670","7117810"," I'm on April."
"7119890","7120750"," Where am I on?"
"7120750","7121470"," Let me take a look. "
"7123310","7126450"," I'm on April 14th, 500 C."
"7128950","7129550"," Spy."
"7134030","7136090"," April 14th, 500 C."
"7137610","7138130"," Spy."
"7143510","7145470"," I'm on Tesla 1200 C's. "
"7147230","7148730"," Aspiring January 28th."
"7149670","7152010"," I'm going to, if I'm going to burn my money on Tesla, right?"
"7152310","7152790"," Here's the deal."
"7153430","7156030"," You guys want, not that you should ever follow me on this. "
"7157890","7159470"," If you're going to play Tesla, right?"
"7161350","7163270"," There's only two ways Tesla trades."
"7164170","7167790"," It's either going to the moon or it's going into the shitter."
"7169850","7172490"," Any of you guys out there that are like, what I'm going to do is I'm going to play in"
"7172490","7175310"," the money calls on Tesla ER on the day of ER. "
"7176470","7178730"," I'm going to buy $30 calls."
"7181150","7181810"," Go home."
"7184310","7188270"," Because the only thing that's printing is outside the money calls. "
"7191890","7196510"," So I got a bunch of free shit tickets on Tesla 1200 C."
"7204270","7206110"," No, I'm not pissed off about it."
"7206490","7208670"," I just don't, I get often I get off."
"7209030","7215530"," Recently I've had some people talking in the chat that are creating issues. "
"7216730","7220530"," So just for today, someone RK February 18th."
"7223350","7226410"," ADC and I'm on spy April 14th 500."
"7226610","7228390"," See, I'm not pissing any of you guys out there either. "
"7228630","7229370"," One way you guys think I'm pissed."
"7235000","7236460"," You guys know what I'm talking about."
"7239160","7241660"," Because yesterday I'm sitting there trying to watch the market. "
"7242180","7244160"," I couldn't pay attention to the, to the chat."
"7244160","7249200"," And then the chat's blowing up with stuff that's not relevant to what we're talking about."
"7249360","7254780"," We were talking about yesterday coming out of a long trade at 440. "
"7255880","7258460"," And then trying to pick it back up if we broke above 440."
"7259420","7262220"," We bounced off it, we came down into the close."
"7263180","7266580"," And as we're coming down to the close this conversation is consuming the entire channel. "
"7267180","7268380"," And it's consuming me."
"7269960","7273020"," And I'm trying to pay attention to the action into the bell."
"7274900","7280260"," And after the bell and it was critical because we were having an impact the market wide across the"
"7280260","7280560"," market. "
"7281820","7288660"," And the best trade yesterday for me at least overall all day long was buying that capitulation"
"7288660","7291280"," after the bell at 405, 410."
"7291920","7297100"," And then I tried to double down on my trade and I tried to add a double like double it"
"7297100","7298340"," go to 400 contracts."
"7299280","7302960"," And I messed up my price that I put in. "
"7302960","7306860"," So in the last minute of the bell I could have made double the money today."
"7307400","7308980"," So I'm kind of upset this morning."
"7309660","7311020"," I'm happy this morning. "
"7311620","7316700"," I'm kind of upset because I'm trying to pay attention to the moves that are made the market when"
"7316700","7318060"," they're critical for me to make money."
"7318580","7322820"," If that's taken away from me, I'll just shut the feed down."
"7323780","7325700"," You're stopping me from eating. "
"7327960","7330380"," And you're clouding what we're trying to do here."
"7331280","7334020"," We can have discussions and all that kind of stuff and fine with discussions."
"7335160","7340240"," But I don't like when there's noise at critical moments in the market. "
"7342780","7346500"," And there were some critical moments in the market yesterday for me at least."
"7347900","7354620"," So this morning when we're talking here telling you guys my trades, my thought process behind my"
"7354620","7356900"," trades, why I'm making these trades."
"7360380","7365940"," If you want my serious trading later today where I care about the trade, it's going to be right"
"7365940","7368060"," before the FMC. "
"7368700","7370100"," We're going to check on it at 12 o'clock."
"7370540","7372060"," We're going to check it at one o'clock."
"7373440","7378940"," And we're more than likely going to put some kind of a straddle on the FMC trade. "
"7381360","7383240"," Right now there's a lot of calls coming in again."
"7383240","7385460"," Once again, we've got calls on spy."
"7388080","7389100"," PFE spy. "
"7390640","7392660"," $150,000 for 39 C."
"7395120","7398480"," Flubu has calls coming in on a PFE as calls coming in at C."
"7400060","7405360"," More calls on the banks, BAC February 18th, 50 C calls on gold."
"7406780","7407740"," I did look at gold yesterday."
"7407840","7409560"," Good job for the gold bugs out there. "
"7409880","7410700"," Maybe metal people."
"7410920","7412120"," You guys did really well in that trade."
"7413240","7414080"," The calls on knock. "
"7414520","7420780"," More calls on spy, 443 C, 108,000 dollars calls on hot calls on the queues."
"7421980","7429400"," 220,000 dollars calls on spy January 26, 439 C calls on another car company."
"7429880","7433040"," I'm not focusing on other car companies today, except for Tesla. "
"7434140","7436100"," You won't tell me to talk about other car companies today."
"7436100","7441420"," The queues January 31st, 365 C on the queues."
"7444220","7446220"," All my trades are green right now. "
"7451300","7452740"," All my trades are green."
"7453540","7455820"," All three in the green right now."
"7463550","7466370"," Yeah, there's a bunch of different ways to set straddles. "
"7467550","7469990"," What I tend to do is this like early in the day."
"7472190","7476770"," If I have the time and if I have the time and right now is streaming, I don't have the"
"7476770","7479670"," time to do this, but normally if it's just me trading."
"7481750","7487690"," What I'm looking for is I'm looking to buy puts cheap and then I'm looking to buy calls cheap. "
"7488790","7489190"," Right."
"7489390","7493910"," If it swings up and down heading into an event like FOMC, I'll take a nice cheap put."
"7495750","7497730"," Then I'll take a nice cheap call. "
"7499450","7501030"," I start to do the math on them."
"7501050","7502210"," I literally use a piece of paper."
"7503890","7505510"," I don't take them way outside the money. "
"7505650","7506050"," Nothing crazy."
"7506270","7506950"," Well, sometimes they will."
"7507190","7508710"," I'll take like a it depends. "
"7508950","7510250"," I have to do the math first."
"7510870","7515810"," What I want to make sure of is that I can if let's say I burn the cuts of the"
"7515810","7518570"," calls of 10 cents and let's say the puts are a dollar."
"7520030","7521290"," This is just as a baseline. "
"7522510","7528870"," I'll make sure that if we're going down that the 10 cent that the move on the downward side is"
"7528870","7530070"," going to print more than 10 cents."
"7530350","7530450"," Right."
"7531330","7537630"," And I'll eat that profit off that 10 or that loss on that 10 cents knowing it better print a"
"7537630","7541210"," dollar 20 at minimum directionally. "
"7542470","7545150"," I have to also note those 10 cent calls."
"7546090","7547390"," They have to print."
"7550350","7553950"," To absorb whatever I'm going to cut the other side from right. "
"7554090","7554430"," Let's say cut."
"7554570","7556630"," Let's say the put started at a dollar."
"7556910","7557970"," We start ripping up. "
"7558710","7563290"," I have to be able to quickly get out of those puts and take no less damage and let's say"
"7563290","7564970"," 70 or 30 cents off them."
"7565570","7570690"," But now those 10 cent calls have to have a ton of them and they need to print three 400%."
"7572530","7575930"," So sometimes it takes me a long time to figure it out. "
"7575990","7577850"," It takes them sometimes a day or two to figure it out."
"7578210","7582110"," Sometimes there's a moment the day before where I can buy the put side and then I have to wait"
"7582110","7583630"," to buy the call side the day of."
"7592600","7595980"," Typically on events like today, it's the put side that's the most expensive. "
"7596700","7598620"," So you try to find a moment where they're dirt cheap."
"7600360","7602420"," Get them as cheaply as you possibly can."
"7603220","7605500"," Usually there's not a lot of premium on the call side. "
"7605500","7607500"," So you can kind of wait for those."
"7609060","7612600"," Watching a lot of spy and QQQ calls coming in right now."
"7613380","7616000"," Tons million dollars. "
"7616280","7617260"," Rack them up."
"7620500","7624500"," Spy January 26 for 39 C for $200,000."
"7625260","7626960"," Q's 118 grand. "
"7627460","7637380"," 365 C spy January 26 for 43 for $150,000 spy January 28 for 42 C half million dollars."
"7643180","7643660"," A."
"7643700","7644160"," M."
"7644660","7645540"," High algo score."
"7646200","7646560"," A."
"7646720","7647200"," E."
"7648220","7648220"," M."
"7648220","7651040"," Alpha Echo Mike January 20. "
"7652900","7653860"," 2023."
"7654500","7656300"," That's one year from now."
"7656840","7658180"," They want to buy some stock. "
"7659580","7662260"," 75 C for $241,000."
"7663520","7665500"," Looks like somebody did some due diligence."
"7667440","7667880"," A."
"7668080","7668180"," E."
"7668660","7668660"," M."
"7684710","7686810"," Yeah, you know, mess Ray's got a good point. "
"7687630","7688770"," That's another way to trade."
"7688870","7690450"," I've traded straddles like that too, right?"
"7691090","7692310"," I've done them in different dates."
"7693010","7693950"," Like you could take a trade. "
"7694230","7694950"," You can do a strategy."
"7695170","7696410"," You can do straddles in different ways, right?"
"7696610","7697290"," Strangles same way."
"7698110","7700310"," You pick a short pick a direction for today. "
"7701070","7705450"," And you hedge yourself on the other side farther dated."
"7707410","7710090"," It looks like some of the structures like that today too."
"7710470","7715190"," Looks like some people are stepping in this morning saying, yeah, there's a high probability that"
"7715190","7718090"," we're going down to four 18 or so or 420 or whatever. "
"7718790","7725290"," But I'm just going to play the call side for today and hold some hedging back towards that retest"
"7725290","7725810"," down below."
"7728020","7728840"," I've done that."
"7728920","7730560"," I've sold two sides of a straddle as well. "
"7730920","7731560"," I have done that."
"7733100","7734760"," That's a very fair point."
"7738240","7739660"," Whoever posted that above. "
"7740580","7741900"," Always quitting the chat today."
"7742720","7743380"," My boy Quinn."
"7744380","7745240"," Good morning, Quinn. "
"7745460","7745880"," How are you?"
"7746500","7747140"," Good to see you, brother."
"7750160","7751640"," You want to bring up Bitcoin, Quinn?"
"7752400","7754340"," And now I can see you guys in the chat again."
"7759240","7761460"," Okay, so we're not long on Bitcoin. "
"7762280","7764140"," Let's bring up Bitcoin for Quinn."
"7765420","7767040"," Let's look at Tesla real quick."
"7769500","7774240"," Oh, look at that smashing and grabbing on Tesla, baby. "
"7775480","7778260"," Me and Quinn are very close friends, just so all of you know that."
"7779160","7781500"," We agree to disagree all the time."
"7782240","7788640"," Quinn does some outstanding research on this market picks great tickers. "
"7790240","7791920"," Man knows what he's doing."
"7793000","7796260"," I have full faith and trust in Quinn at all times."
"7803330","7808410"," Look at this Tesla smashing and grabbing over here just murdered it. "
"7809270","7810550"," Destroying the bears."
"7813030","7815270"," Tesla's saying I don't believe you."
"7817650","7819770"," I don't believe you. "
"7825060","7826140"," We're going to look up."
"7826900","7829040"," So we got Tesla just smashing and grabbing."
"7830160","7832100"," Bull in the China closet on Tesla. "
"7835000","7836620"," Here are indicators positive."
"7837940","7840220"," Buyers are making another run higher on Tesla."
"7844940","7847220"," We're going to look up Bitcoin for my man. "
"7847540","7848080"," Quinn."
"7849220","7851780"," Make sure you seek him out on Twitter."
"7857180","7858540"," He is a part of the gang. "
"7866240","7869760"," I'll get back to posting about stocks once Bitcoin dies."
"7872380","7873860"," I love you, Quinn."
"7874560","7875040"," Hold on here. "
"7875380","7875740"," Wait a minute."
"7876180","7879060"," We might have to turn off a spy real quick."
"7880340","7880660"," Okay, we got. "
"7884500","7886540"," We're going to disconnect from the DX feed."
"7888060","7890440"," Getting all kinds of weirdness going on here."
"7893220","7894540"," GDX doesn't want to connect. "
"7895340","7897100"," We're going to bring up just GDX for Quinn."
"7897700","7899000"," Whenever Quinn stops in."
"7899940","7902980"," Whenever Quinn stops in, we're going to stop everything just for him. "
"7910520","7913960"," Whenever markets and mayhem stops in, we're going to stop everything for him."
"7914940","7915680"," Here's a whole crew."
"7916940","7918680"," Here's a whole posse out there. "
"7918800","7919780"," A bunch of Tesla bulls."
"7920000","7921060"," I'll stop everything for them."
"7922080","7924460"," A whole bunch of guys have been trading with for a long time, so. "
"7938790","7940210"," Let's check out Bitcoin."
"7942190","7944090"," As it loads up my man, Quinn."

"8016070","8017810"," More calls on Twitter. "
"8019810","8021850"," The redheaded stepchild Twitter."

"8038850","8039750"," Who's the other guy?"
"8039870","8046720"," My daughter's yesterday. "
"8047000","8048000"," It's terrible."
"8051120","8053000"," My daughter's yesterday said."
"8054240","8057500"," They were talking about Tyrion Lannister. "
"8066340","8068680"," They didn't know the actor's name."

"8075660","8076580"," Peter Dinklage's name. "
"8077420","8078580"," She's trying to figure it out."
"8081220","8084660"," They're arguing about it, talking about it, what's his name."
"8084660","8089520"," And I'm just sitting there waiting and I go, oh. "
"8090800","8094420"," I go, I know that guy, I know that actor."
"8094540","8095740"," I go, that guy is rich."
"8098540","8100440"," I go, but he owns Twitter. "
"8102280","8103580"," My wife goes, no he doesn't."
