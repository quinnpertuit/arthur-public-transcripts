"mYsnDJ4zyQg","0","7000"," Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","30000","37000"," See you in the next video."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","60000","67000"," Check 1, 2."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","67000","71000"," Power hour, or what's the other thing that they say about it, you know, sour hour."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","71000","73000"," We've got sour hour coming up."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","73000","77000"," Now we're going to go to the full screen chart here and take a look."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","77000","78000"," You can see the pen in the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","78000","79000"," I've got some calls on here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","79000","81000"," I feel like 800 bucks on some calls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","81000","84000"," They're not a bunch of money, but they got these puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","84000","85000"," They're still on right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","85000","86000"," Now there's 314."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","86000","88000"," I said 300, but I typed 330."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","88000","90000"," Actually, it was 300."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","90000","94000"," Now it's 314,000 puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","94000","97000"," Unless they want to own the market here, which would be kind of nice to see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","97000","103000"," So if they didn't actually own the market, they owned 314,000 contracts and puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","103000","104000"," That's pretty good."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","104000","107000"," Someone's actually buying the market down here, which is good to see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","107000","108000"," Where's the hourly trigger right now?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","108000","110000"," That's coming screaming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","110000","112000"," 43, 173."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","112000","114000"," Hourly triggers now down here, 73."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","114000","115000"," Keeps coming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","115000","117000"," Keeps coming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","117000","118000"," It's full of the pivot now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","118000","119000"," There's your pivot."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","119000","125000"," We're going to look at the five minute chart, and then we're going to look at the five minute"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","125000","126000"," chart and see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","126000","129000"," So I'm down here trying to buy calls into this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","129000","130000"," Let's talk about that for a minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","130000","132000"," So I'm down here trying to buy calls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","132000","135000"," This is the actual move right here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","135000","138000"," We traded that up for a minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","138000","139000"," What else?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","139000","141000"," I'm thinking about calls right here, something like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","141000","146000"," I'm trying to take this trade up into this close right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","147000","150000"," You've got the weekly trigger, which is going on down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","150000","151000"," You've got to see all this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","151000","152000"," Okay."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","152000","154000"," You have the weekly trigger down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","154000","157000"," There's your price target down here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","157000","158000"," You got Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","158000","160000"," We're going to talk about next week today."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","160000","161000"," So you guys can make a plan."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","161000","168000"," Friday set or Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","168000","169000"," Can you see all this?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","169000","174000"," I'll begin with that over a little bit right there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","174000","178000"," Just to get next week involved in this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","178000","180000"," You may have to go to a 50 minute chart."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","180000","181000"," Go to a 50 minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","181000","185000"," Oh, that's better."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","185000","186000"," Yeah."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","186000","188000"," There's the warning right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","188000","192000"," So there's going to be Elliot waivers out there that are going to say,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","192000","195000"," we're trying to tag to think 44660 up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","195000","197000"," They might say, oh, that's plenty."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","197000","202000"," You didn't actually tag the 448 or the 450 above, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","202000","205000"," You can tag either of these right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","205000","210000"," And that we're continuing the leg down, second leg down into,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","210000","213000"," give it some of this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","213000","216000"," We're continuing that leg down into the weekly trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","216000","217000"," This is the price target down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","217000","220000"," I'll extend this over because we're done here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","220000","222000"," This would be the Elliot waivers out there that are like, nope."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","222000","225000"," You come down here, slam it down, come back up,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","225000","228000"," and there's actually your final target down below."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","228000","231000"," You have an oversold bounce, and we go back up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","231000","232000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","232000","235000"," And then you come right back down and we're bloodbath at that point."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","235000","237000"," I'm assuming that's a bear's thing."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","237000","239000"," Now, that's 450 that we talked about."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","239000","241000"," Do we get the 450 by Friday?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","241000","242000"," Didn't do that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","242000","245000"," Unexpected move up into the overnight, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","245000","246000"," Tagging 446."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","246000","248000"," Maybe they're counting that as the horseshoes and hand grenades."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","248000","251000"," To actually get down to that price target down below 450."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","251000","254000"," We're going to look at two important things for factors in this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","254000","259000"," We're going to look at the event ball that comes off tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","260000","261000"," Where's this Friday?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","261000","262000"," Saturday?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","262000","265000"," Or, say, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, right there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","265000","267000"," You've got the daily trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","267000","270000"," Come back to a five minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","270000","274000"," You've got the daily trigger or hourly trigger right here currently."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","274000","277000"," Until next week."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","277000","282000"," And the hope here from bears that they trade this on."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","282000","286000"," They trade this tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","286000","288000"," Sellers want to be trading this tomorrow, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","288000","289000"," You want to get down here?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","289000","292000"," Have hawkish Jerome Powell."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","292000","293000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","293000","294000"," Whoo hoo."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","294000","295000"," Jerome Powell's done talking."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","295000","296000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","296000","297000"," The ball comes off."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","297000","298000"," We head up into end of week."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","298000","299000"," So if you're a bull, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","299000","302000"," We want to talk about the event ball coming off tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","302000","305000"," We want to talk about this bottom right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","305000","307000"," That bulls are trying to establish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","307000","311000"," And then also this previous low back here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","311000","313000"," So we have known buyers."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","313000","317000"," We've got known demand right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","318000","319000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","319000","322000"," That's known demand."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","322000","325000"," The bulls are saying the buyers are saying that they're up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","325000","327000"," They've moved higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","327000","329000"," So far that's proven itself."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","329000","330000"," The buyers are actually still here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","330000","333000"," But you can see the sellers coming down right here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","333000","334000"," Sellers are coming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","334000","337000"," Telling you know, telling you they're right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","337000","340000"," So you're going to get this corkscrew option, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","340000","343000"," This wind up to make a decision if we're going up or down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","343000","346000"," Big blast down or big blast to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","347000","351000"," So if you don't get the hawkish bed and the event ball pulls off the market,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","351000","354000"," you should see some major squeezing to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","354000","357000"," If you get the dumish bed, that's my expectation."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","357000","358000"," You get the dumish bed."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","358000","360000"," Then you're going to get a squeeze higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","360000","362000"," Now, if you're a bull, you might not get that squeeze tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","362000","365000"," That's my one key to you would be if dealers, if we commit tomorrow"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","365000","368000"," and you get the bullish bed, you might get a failure up here at 4.41"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","368000","369000"," or even 4.44."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","369000","371000"," So pay attention to that tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","371000","375000"," If you're like me saying, hey, you're going to get the dumish Jerome Powell"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","375000","379000"," be concerned about dealers stopping that trade and not actually doing that"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","379000","383000"," print to 450 until Monday or Wednesday of next week."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","383000","384000"," So be aware of that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","384000","387000"," If you're like, well, I'm bullish on Jerome, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","387000","389000"," You'll end up getting that squeeze up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","389000","390000"," Repricing of options."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","390000","394000"," So spread might actually be your best bet for like next Wednesday to the upside"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","394000","397000"," like 450 C spread to the upside on Wednesday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","397000","399000"," This shows Monday, but it's for Wednesday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","399000","402000"," And that is just to clear out or not enough to deal with the ball that comes"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","402000","404000"," off that event, the repricing of options."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","404000","408000"," If you're a bear here into tomorrow and you think, well, cap, we're going to get,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","408000","411000"," we're going to get the bear or the hawkish fed and even if we don't, well,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","411000","413000"," they're going to try to close all this stuff out down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","413000","416000"," We'll talk about what's lower and why it's lower the magnet."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","416000","418000"," That's from our JPM."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","418000","421000"," JPM is a magnet, magnet actually 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","421000","427000"," So there's a JPM collar trade for this quarter all the way down here at this 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","427000","429000"," So we'll write that in right now too."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","429000","431000"," We've got the JPM collar that's right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","432000","434000"," This is a JPM collar."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","436000","438000"," That's been acting as a magnet."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","440000","441000"," Come on now, fingers."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","442000","443000"," It's not JPME."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","445000","446000"," That's been acting as a magnet."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","446000","450000"," It'll also act as a repelling on the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","450000","453000"," So if you trade down here, if we trade down here,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","453000","457000"," then we get down here to this target, you're going to see a ton, not JPM."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","457000","460000"," You're going to see other people that are trading that little exercise."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","460000","463000"," That position and a huge bounce off of that position."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","463000","469000"," So if you're a bull, kind of looking for this 420-ish in 426 to begin to get bullish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","469000","473000"," If you're also bullish, you're looking to get above right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","473000","476000"," Same as we said yesterday and all week long, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","476000","478000"," The hourly trigger needs to be above."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","478000","481000"," The daily trigger price needs to be above and a confirmation trade."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","481000","483000"," So bulls still don't have that on their side at this time."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","483000","484000"," They don't have it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","484000","485000"," Didn't have it yesterday either."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","485000","487000"," Even in this close, they didn't have it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","487000","488000"," This morning they didn't have it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","488000","489000"," They had the hourly trigger below the daily trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","489000","492000"," And the hourly trigger was down here, believe it or not yesterday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","492000","493000"," And this was above here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","493000","495000"," This is where we got sold off on the hourly trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","495000","497000"," So even right now, bulls don't have like a,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","497000","500000"," bulls don't have like a thesis to say, I'm bullish here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","500000","508000"," Bulls have a thesis above 443.91 with the hourly trigger above it and price above that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","508000","514000"," Bulls also have a thesis down below here at 427 and even lower it 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","514000","516000"," Other than that, bulls don't have a thesis here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","516000","520000"," Now with all that said, you have the ball kicking out or collapsing tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","520000","524000"," If you don't get the, get that out of the way because we're going to explain it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","524000","528000"," If you don't get that, if you don't get that ball from the Fed President tomorrow,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","528000","532000"," all of the hedging from larger market participants will come off."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","532000","536000"," We'll come off the market tomorrow for that Fed speaker."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","536000","539000"," So at some point tomorrow, at some point tomorrow in the morning,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","539000","543000"," you should see the ball come off and the market start to bounce and spring."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","543000","547000"," So those two targets to the upside, 441, 65,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","547000","551000"," I think they come down to, I think that hourly's going to come down to"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","551000","553000"," 440, 97 by open tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","553000","555000"," Somewhere right down in here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","555000","557000"," 440, 97. I'll tell you what, man."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","557000","559000"," I'll tell you what, you will put up tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","559000","563000"," This hourly is down here and you're just like kind of like grinding this right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","563000","565000"," It's going to squeeze like crazy."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","565000","567000"," Squeeze like crazy."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","567000","570000"," So be prepared for that tomorrow. We'll be here at 930 for that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","570000","571000"," I'll try to be here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","571000","575000"," I think this tomorrow now is a little bit late, but it's mostly because I'm in trades and shit."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","575000","579000"," I'm trying to exit. So just down in here for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","579000","582000"," Do you want my thoughts on what happens tomorrow?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","582000","584000"," Or even today, the same thing as yesterday, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","584000","586000"," We talked about this trade higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","586000","589000"," This trade, well, if we talk about this trade lower into the morning,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","589000","593000"," then a higher trade and then a down trade into Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","593000","596000"," So kind of on that track, we want a little bit higher than we expected."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","596000","599000"," And we got a little bit later, two hours later, we said 11 o'clock for here,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","599000","602000"," one to be in 12 or 10 o'clock, one to be in 12 o'clock, we hit that low."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","602000","605000"," And so even right here, I'm going to expect this move higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","605000","609000"," And I'm going to expect futures to get sold by 6 a.m. somewhere up in here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","609000","617000"," Probably at 440 to a target of 440 in futures to sell this down into Jerome's meeting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","617000","620000"," And then once that's done, we're going to square and squeeze higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","620000","625000"," I'm going to go with Jerome being very positive into this open tomorrow or into this speech"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","625000","626000"," that he's giving tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","626000","629000"," I think you'll still get the ball from it going into it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","629000","632000"," But I don't think you get the, I don't think you get the bloodbath."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","632000","633000"," I think you get this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","633000","635000"," I think you get down into here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","635000","636000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","636000","638000"," Maybe get some blood into that Jerome speaking."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","638000","641000"," Let's see what time that is again tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","641000","642000"," 10.05 a.m."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","642000","644000"," So right around bloodbath down at 10 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","644000","647000"," I got a little bit before."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","647000","649000"," Right there, bloodbath into 10 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","649000","651000"," And then I don't think you get the Jerome that you think you're getting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","651000","655000"," I think as soon as he starts talking, he starts to dissuade or tell people to get fucked."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","655000","658000"," You might get this tomorrow, this 440, 441."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","658000","662000"," And then the greater move will come in into next week to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","662000","666000"," Now if we do, if you wanted to buy puts into tomorrow,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","666000","669000"," my personal belief is that you would do them at like four o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","669000","672000"," The 415 something like that, try to capture that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","672000","677000"," If that happens, if we squeeze up into this close right here and you're buying puts into tomorrow"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","677000","679000"," and we sell down just like I do every day, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","679000","684000"," If we're selling down or up into the open, you close that position."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","684000","686000"," So you could try to hold it for half an hour down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","686000","689000"," But for me, if you get that trade, you just take the money and run."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","689000","691000"," So we'll see what happens here in this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","691000","694000"," My expectation for tomorrow is a low."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","694000","697000"," Our expectation for today is that we trade up into this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","697000","699000"," You'll get a sell on 440 in the overnight."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","699000","705000"," And then the low to the downside is going to trade to, let me take a look at it really quick."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","705000","711000"," Probably starting for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","712000","715000"," 435-35."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","715000","718000"," Right here, price target for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","718000","722000"," Let's see how close we got to it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","722000","725000"," Let me kind of a fun exercise."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","725000","728000"," Downside PT for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","728000","731000"," Price target for 435-35."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","731000","734000"," That was like doing this shit."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","734000","737000"," So right here, for tomorrow, this is Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","737000","739000"," Price target for tomorrow, you draw these in every day, don't we?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","740000","742000"," Squeeze up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","742000","744000"," 440 in the overnight."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","744000","747000"," Then right down here by open tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","747000","750000"," And I don't think you get your, I'll even draw."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","750000","753000"," We'll just leave this up for tomorrow because it's kind of fun."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","753000","756000"," I think you get your squeeze up to 440."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","756000","766000"," At 11 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","766000","770000"," I think by in a day, you wind up right up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","770000","772000"," I think it's kind of cooke-cookey."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","772000","774000"," It might be 443."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","774000","775000"," Get that back."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","775000","776000"," At tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","776000","777000"," Be like down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","777000","784000"," Yeah, dump that and do it again."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","784000","786000"," I think you're somewhere that's like 440."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","786000","788000"," Initial squeeze."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","788000","789000"," Consolidate."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","789000","794000"," And then this bigger move up into the close right there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","794000","797000"," That's tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","797000","799000"," We'll just put that back here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","799000","803000"," If you're a futures trader, I'd be trying to sell them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","803000","805000"," And then watch them park this shit into the close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","805000","806000"," It's almost three o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","806000","808000"," We'll start talking about, oh, it's three o'clock right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","808000","809000"," Give me a second here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","809000","812000"," So it's 1501."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","812000","814000"," Yeah, one more hour left."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","814000","817000"," Power hour or, um, what's the other thing that they say about it?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","817000","819000"," You know, sour hour."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","819000","821000"," We got sour hour coming up."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","822000","825000"," We're going to go to the full screen chart here and take a look."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","825000","826000"," You can see the pin in the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","826000","827000"," I've got some calls on here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","827000","829000"," They're like 800 bucks on some calls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","829000","832000"," They're not a bunch of money, but, um, they got these puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","832000","834000"," They're still on right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","834000","835000"," Now there's 314."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","835000","837000"," I said 300, but I typed 330."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","837000","838000"," Actually, it was 300."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","838000","842000"," Now it's 314,000 puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","842000","845000"," Unless they want to own the market here, which would be kind of nice to see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","845000","847000"," So they didn't actually own the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","848000","851000"," They own 314,000 contracts and puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","851000","852000"," Uh, that's pretty good."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","852000","855000"," Someone's actually buying the market down here, which is good to see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","855000","856000"," Uh, where's the hourly trigger right now?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","856000","857000"," That's coming screaming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","857000","861000"," 43, 173 hourly triggers now down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","861000","863000"," 73 keeps coming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","863000","865000"," It keeps coming down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","865000","867000"," It's full of the pivot now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","867000","868000"," There's a pivot."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","868000","872000"," Um, we're going to look at the five minute chart and we're going to look at."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","872000","875000"," We're going to have a five minute chart and see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","876000","878000"," So I'm down here trying to buy calls into this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","878000","879000"," Let's talk about that for a minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","879000","881000"," So I'm down here trying to buy calls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","881000","884000"," This is the actual move right here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","884000","886000"," We traded that up for a minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","886000","887000"," Uh, what else?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","887000","889000"," I'm thinking about calls right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","889000","890000"," Something like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","890000","893000"," I'm trying to take this trade up into this close right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","893000","898000"," Um, you've got the weekly trigger, which is what's going on down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","898000","899000"," You got to see all this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","899000","900000"," Okay."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","900000","902000"," You have the weekly trigger down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","902000","904000"," There's your price target down here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","904000","905000"," You got Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","905000","907000"," We're going to talk about next week today."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","907000","908000"," So you guys can make a plan."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","908000","915000"," Friday set or Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","915000","916000"," Can you see all this?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","916000","917000"," I'll pick again."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","917000","918000"," Look at that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","918000","920000"," Over a little bit right there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","920000","923000"," Just to get next week involved in this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","923000","925000"," You may have to go to a 50 minute chart."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","925000","926000"," Throw a 50 minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","926000","927000"," Oh, that's better."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","927000","928000"," Yeah."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","928000","929000"," There's the one."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","930000","931000"," Right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","931000","939000"," So there's going to be Elliot waivers out there that are going to say, uh, we try, we tag to think 446 60 up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","939000","941000"," They might say, oh, that's plenty."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","941000","946000"," You didn't actually tag the 448 or the 450 above, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","946000","948000"," You can tag either of these right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","948000","952000"," And that we're continuing the leg down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","952000","954000"," Second leg down into."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","955000","958000"," We're continuing that leg down into the weekly trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","958000","960000"," This is the price target down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","960000","962000"," I'll extend this over because we're done here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","962000","967000"," This would be the Elliot waivers out there that are like, nope, you come down here, slam it down, come back up."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","967000","970000"," And there is actually your final target down below."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","970000","973000"," You have an oversold bounce and we go back up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","973000","974000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","974000","977000"," And then you come right back down and we're bloodbath at that point."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","977000","979000"," I'm going to go back up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","979000","981000"," And we go back up here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","981000","984000"," And then you come right back down and we're bloodbath at that point."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","984000","985000"," I'm assuming that's a bear's thing."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","985000","987000"," Uh, now that's 450 that we talked about."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","987000","989000"," Do we get the 450 by Friday?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","989000","990000"," Didn't do that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","990000","993000"," Uh, unexpected move up into the overnight, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","993000","994000"," Tag in 446."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","994000","999000"," Maybe they're counting that as the horse using anger nades to actually get down to that price target down below 450."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","999000","1002000"," We're going to look at two important things for factors in this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1002000","1006000"," We're going to look at the event ball that comes off tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1007000","1009000"," Where's, uh, this Friday?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1009000","1010000"," Saturday?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1010000","1013000"," Or, excuse me, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, right there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1013000","1015000"," You've got the daily trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1015000","1016000"," Go back to a five minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1016000","1017000"," I can't."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1019000","1023000"," You've got the daily trigger or hourly trigger right here currently into next week."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1023000","1029000"," And the hope here from bears that they trade this on."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1029000","1032000"," Uh, they trade this tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1033000","1035000"," Uh, sellers want to be trading this tomorrow, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1035000","1036000"," You want to get down here?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1036000","1039000"," Have hawkish Jerome Powell, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1039000","1040000"," Whoo hoo."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1040000","1041000"," Jerome Powell's done talking."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1041000","1042000"," Right."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1042000","1044000"," The ball comes off and we head up into end of week."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1044000","1049000"," So if you're, if you're a bull, right, we want to talk about the event ball coming off tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1049000","1054000"," We want to talk about this bottom right here, uh, that their tr, that bulls are trying to establish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1054000","1057000"," And then also this previous low back here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1057000","1059000"," So we have known buyers."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1060000","1063000"," We've got known demand right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1063000","1064000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1064000","1065000"," That's known demand."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1065000","1069000"," Uh, the bulls are saying the buyers are saying that they're up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1069000","1071000"," They've moved higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1071000","1073000"," So far that's proven itself."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1073000","1077000"," The buyers are actually still here, but you can see the sellers coming down right here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1077000","1081000"," Sellers are coming down telling you know, telling you they're right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1081000","1084000"," So you're going to get this corkscrew option, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1085000","1088000"," So you're going to get this corkscrew option, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1088000","1094000"," This, this wind up to make a decision if we're going up or down, big blast down or big blast to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1094000","1099000"," So if you don't get the, if you don't get the, uh, the hawkish bed and the event ball pulls off the market,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1099000","1102000"," you should see some major squeezing to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1102000","1106000"," If you get like the, you get like the dumbest bed, that's my expectation that you get the dumbest bed."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1106000","1108000"," Then you're going to get a squeeze higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1108000","1110000"," Now, if you're a bull, you might not get that squeeze tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1110000","1114000"," That's my one key to you would be if dealers, if we commit tomorrow and you get the bullish bed,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1114000","1118000"," you might get a failure up here at 441 or even 444."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1118000","1119000"," So pay attention to that tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1119000","1123000"," If you're like, if you're like me saying, hey, you're going to get the, um, the dumbest, uh, Jerome Powell."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1123000","1129000"," Be concerned about dealers stopping that trade and not actually doing that print to 450."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1129000","1131000"," Until Monday or Wednesday of next week."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1131000","1132000"," So be aware of that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1132000","1135000"," If you're like, well, I'm bullish on Jerome, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1135000","1137000"," You'll end up getting that, that squeeze up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1137000","1138000"," Replacing of options."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1138000","1142000"," So spread might actually be your best bet for like next Wednesday to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1142000","1145000"," Like 450 C spread to the upside on Wednesday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1145000","1147000"," This shows Monday, but it's for Wednesday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1147000","1151000"," And that is just to clear out or not, not to deal with the vault that comes off that event."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1151000","1152000"," The reprising of options."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1152000","1158000"," If you're a bear here into tomorrow and you think, well, cap, uh, we're going to get, we're going to get the bear or the hawkish fed."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1158000","1161000"," And even if we don't, well, they're going to try to close all this stuff out down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1161000","1164000"," Um, we'll talk about what's lower and why it's lower."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1164000","1169000"," So that's a very similar magnet that's from the, um, JPM."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1169000","1172000"," JPM is a magnet at actually 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1172000","1178000"," So there's a JPM collar trade for this quarter all the way down here at this 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1178000","1179000"," So we'll write that in right now too."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1179000","1182000"," We've got the JPM collar that's right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1182000","1186000"," This is a JPM collar."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1186000","1191000"," That's been acting as a magnet."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1191000","1196000"," It'll also act as a repelling on the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1196000","1200000"," So if you trade down here, if we trade down here, did we get down here to this target?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1200000","1202000"," You're going to see a ton, not JPM."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1202000","1205000"," You're going to see other people that are trading that little exercise."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1205000","1207000"," That position and a huge bounce off of that position."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1207000","1214000"," So if you're a bull kind of looking for this 420 ish and 426 to begin to get bullish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1214000","1218000"," If you're also bullish, you're looking to get above right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1218000","1220000"," Same as we said yesterday and all week long, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1220000","1225000"," The hourly trigger needs to be above the daily trigger price needs to be above and a confirmation trade."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1225000","1227000"," So bulls still don't have that on their side."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1227000","1228000"," At this time, they don't have it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1228000","1229000"," Didn't have it yesterday either."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1229000","1230000"," Even in this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1230000","1231000"," They didn't have it this morning."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1231000","1232000"," They didn't have it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1232000","1234000"," They had the hourly trigger below the daily trigger and the death."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1234000","1235000"," The hourly trigger was down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1235000","1236000"," Believe it or not yesterday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1236000","1237000"," And this was above here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1237000","1239000"," This is where we got sold off on on that early trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1239000","1244000"," So even right now, bulls don't have like a bull's don't have like a thesis to say."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1244000","1245000"," I'm bullish here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1245000","1249000"," Bulls have a thesis above."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1249000","1253000"," 443 91 with the hourly trigger above it and price above that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1253000","1259000"," Bulls also have a thesis down below here at 427 and even lower it for 20 other than that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1259000","1260000"," Bulls don't have a thesis here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1260000","1265000"," Now with all that said, you have the ball kicking our or collapsing."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1265000","1266000"," Tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1266000","1267000"," If you don't get the."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1267000","1268000"," Get that away because we're going to explain it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1268000","1269000"," If you don't get that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1269000","1272000"," You don't get that ball from the Fed president tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1272000","1277000"," All of the hedging from larger market participants will come off."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1277000","1280000"," Will come off the markets tomorrow for that Fed speaker."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1280000","1285000"," So at some point tomorrow, at some point tomorrow in the morning, you should see the ball come"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1285000","1287000"," off and the market start to bounce and spring."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1287000","1289000"," So those two targets to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1289000","1290000"," 441 65."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1290000","1295000"," I think they come down to think that hourly is going to come down to 440 97 by open tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1295000","1297000"," Somewhere down in here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1297000","1298000"," 440 97."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1298000","1299000"," I'll tell you what, man."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1299000","1301000"," I'll tell you what, you open up tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1301000","1311000"," This hourly is down here and you're just like kind of like grinding this right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1311000","1313000"," It's going to squeeze like crazy."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1313000","1315000"," Squeeze like crazy."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1315000","1316000"," So be prepared for that tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1316000","1318000"," We'll be here at 930 for that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1318000","1319000"," I'll try to be here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1319000","1323000"," I think this morning I was a little bit late, but it's mostly because I'm in trades and shit."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1323000","1324000"," I'm trying to exit."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1324000","1327000"," So just just just down in here for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1327000","1330000"," Do you want my thoughts on what happens tomorrow?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1330000","1332000"," Or even today, the same thing as yesterday, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1332000","1334000"," We talked about this trade higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1334000","1335000"," This trade."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1335000","1338000"," Well, if we talk about this trade lower into the morning and then a higher trade and then"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1338000","1340000"," a down trade into Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1340000","1343000"," So kind of on that track, but we're a little bit higher than we expected."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1343000","1345000"," And we got a little bit later."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1345000","1348000"," Two hours later, we said 11 o'clock for here, but it wanted to be in 12 or 10 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1348000","1349000"," It wanted to be in 12 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1349000","1350000"," We hit that low."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1350000","1353000"," And so even right here, I'm going to expect this move higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1353000","1357000"," And I'm going to expect futures to get sold by 6 a.m. somewhere up in here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1357000","1365000"," Probably at 440 to a target of 440 in futures to sell this down into Jerome's meeting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1365000","1368000"," And then once that's done, we're going to squeeze higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1368000","1373000"," I'm going to go with Jerome being very positive into this open tomorrow or into this speech"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1373000","1374000"," that he's giving tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1374000","1377000"," I think that I think you'll still get the ball from it going into it, but I don't think"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1377000","1380000"," you get the, I don't think you get the bloodbath."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1380000","1381000"," I think you get this."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1381000","1383000"," I think you get down into here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1383000","1384000"," Right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1384000","1386000"," Maybe you get some blood into that Jerome speaking."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1386000","1388000"," Let's see what time that is again tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1388000","1390000"," 10.05 a.m."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1390000","1392000"," So right around bloodbath down at 10 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1392000","1395000"," Let's take a little bit before."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1395000","1397000"," Right there, bloodbath into 10 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1397000","1399000"," And then I don't think you get the Jerome that you think you're getting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1399000","1403000"," I think as soon as he starts talking, he starts to dissuade or tell people to get fucked."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1403000","1404000"," You might get this tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1404000","1410000"," This 4.40, 4.41, and then the greater move will come in into next week to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1410000","1416000"," Now, if we do, if you wanted to buy puts into tomorrow, my personal belief is that you would"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1416000","1420000"," do them at like four o'clock, the 4.15 something like that, try to capture that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1420000","1424000"," If that happens, if we squeeze up into this close right here and you're buying puts into"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1424000","1427000"," tomorrow and we sell down just like I do every day, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1427000","1431000"," If we're selling down or up into the open, you close that position."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1431000","1433000"," I guess you could try to hold it for half an hour down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1433000","1436000"," But for me, if you get that trade, you just take the money and run."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1436000","1438000"," So we'll see what happens here in this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1438000","1441000"," My expectation for tomorrow is a low."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1441000","1444000"," Our expectation for today is that we trade up into this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1444000","1446000"," You'll get a sell on 4.40 in the overnight."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1446000","1452000"," And then the low to the downside is going to trade to take a look at it really quick."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1452000","1457000"," Probably starting for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1458000","1461000"," 4.35, 35."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1461000","1465000"," Right here, price target for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1465000","1468000"," Let's see how close we got to it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1468000","1472000"," Let me kind of a fun exercise."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1472000","1475000"," Downside PT for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1475000","1478000"," Price target 4.35, 35."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1478000","1481000"," That was like doing this shit."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1481000","1484000"," So right here, for tomorrow, this is Friday."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1485000","1486000"," Price target for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1486000","1487000"," We draw these in every day, don't we?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1487000","1488000"," Or we've been doing it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1488000","1490000"," Squeeze up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1490000","1492000"," 4.40 in the overnight."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1492000","1495000"," Then right down here by open tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1495000","1498000"," And I don't think you get your, I don't even draw."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1498000","1501000"," We'll just leave this up for tomorrow because we're kind of fun."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1501000","1504000"," I think you get your squeeze up to 4.40."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1504000","1507000"," 11 o'clock."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1514000","1518000"," I think by in a day, you wind up right up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1518000","1521000"," I think it's going to be kind of cooke-cookey."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1521000","1522000"," It might be 4.43."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1522000","1523000"," Look at that back."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1523000","1524000"," At tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1524000","1525000"," Be like down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1525000","1532000"," Yeah, dump that and do it again."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1532000","1534000"," I think you're somewhere that's like 4.40."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1534000","1536000"," Initial squeeze."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1536000","1537000"," Consolidate."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1537000","1541000"," And then this bigger move up into the close right there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1541000","1543000"," Something like that tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1544000","1546000"," We'll just put that back here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1546000","1549000"," If you're a futures trader, I'd be trying to sell them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1549000","1551000"," And this is where I'm scared."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1551000","1553000"," This is where I'm really scared."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1553000","1554000"," It's like this 4.50."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1554000","1558000"," What I'm scared about this is this 4.59."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1558000","1560000"," 4.60 up here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1560000","1566000"," This whole zone up here is going to be a big, big for the next month."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1566000","1569000"," Coming into the 31st, end of month, you're going to call it window."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1569000","1570000"," You're going to say it's window dressing."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1570000","1572000"," So you're going to try to tell me, you're going to try to tell me in the chat."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1572000","1574000"," Just window dressing cap."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1574000","1578000"," I'm going to tell you that it's not window dressing."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1578000","1582000"," But my fear here coming into the 31st that I don't want to see."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1582000","1583000"," Let's start."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1583000","1584000"," Keep this on your palate here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1584000","1587000"," What I don't want to see is that failure after the 31st into the 1st."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1587000","1590000"," And we then go back down and trade that 4.26."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1590000","1594000"," This would be the signal that the bull run is over."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1594000","1598000"," So as time passes, you've heard me talk about bulls having only so much time to get things done."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1599000","1603000"," This is kind of the last, it's kind of like the last hurrah for bulls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1603000","1605000"," They have, you know, this is the 31st right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1605000","1612000"," If you have a failure at that 50 or 48 coming into the 31st and they start to sell this down into the month of September."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1612000","1620000"," Then you know that you've only got a month left to the corner and they'll likely pin that 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1620000","1624000"," They'll likely pin this 420 into September."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1624000","1630000"," So if that fails into the 1st, you will see a pin into the month of September at 420, probably by the 15th."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1630000","1632000"," And we'll bounce around it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1632000","1645000"," We can even go lower than the 420 trade 400 and literally trade a zone above and below like 430 to 400 and just literally in that 420 into end of September."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1645000","1649000"," So bulls kind of at the last at the ass end of their run."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1649000","1651000"," This is kind of the place right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1652000","1654000"," We said this back here, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1654000","1659000"," We said right here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1659000","1661000"," We said bulls have to get it on."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1661000","1662000"," They have no choice."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1662000","1664000"," They have to go higher sitting at that same level once again."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1664000","1671000"," And they really don't have any time left to trade that 472, 465, 472."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1671000","1673000"," And it takes 480 off the table for December."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1673000","1679000"," So I don't think that if you're going to pin 400 or 420 for the quarter that you can,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1679000","1684000"," I don't think that you can actually say to yourself, like with a straight face and say, yeah, we're at 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1684000","1687000"," Let's say on September 20 or excuse me, September 29th, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1687000","1688000"," 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1688000","1689000"," I don't think it was a straight face."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1689000","1693000"," You can say, yeah, we're going to put on 600 points in Q4."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1693000","1694000"," Is it possible?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1694000","1695000"," Yeah, it's possible December."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1695000","1696000"," We do some wack shit."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1696000","1699000"," Sometimes we'll put on crazy numbers the last month of the quarter."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1699000","1701000"," But dude, that's a big ask for bulls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1701000","1704000"," I would be suspect of you if you were a bull into."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1704000","1711000"," I would be suspect of you if you were a bull into this Q4 at 420."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1711000","1713000"," Can we weapon for and Q4?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1713000","1714000"," Yeah."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1714000","1715000"," You're going to get 480?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1715000","1716000"," Fuck no."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1716000","1722000"," Even if you got 460 or 470 for December 1st, your whole bull piece is gone at that point, my view."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1722000","1731000"," Because they're going to start Q1 of 2024 and likely we're going to go pretty low in that Q1 of 2024."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1731000","1734000"," Expectation in Q1 of 2024 is a pretty deep low."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1734000","1739000"," So you're going to get your true bear suits on when you get into that January 1."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1739000","1740000"," You know, likely be bullish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1740000","1742000"," You'll see like bulls saying everything is all set."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1742000","1744000"," We just got a new high or something, same like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1744000","1747000"," But I will not be bullish at that point in the year."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1747000","1749000"," At that point, January 1st, we pretty fucking bearish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1749000","1752000"," Even if we're up there, we're pretty bearish at that point."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1752000","1755000"," So just right now in tomorrow, they're already trying to sell it down, pin it down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1755000","1757000"," Still long, these calls got a bunch of them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1757000","1758000"," I don't believe them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1758000","1759000"," I don't think they're going to close these in the money."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1759000","1762000"," So we'll see if they do where they don't get the target above here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1762000","1764000"," That's all kind of what you do."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1764000","1766000"," Target is that early trigger."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1766000","1769000"," We'll see if they can pin it or if they sell this close into tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1769000","1772000"," So I'll be here with you tomorrow at 9.30 in the morning."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1772000","1774000"," I'll try to get here early so that we don't miss the speech."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1774000","1775000"," And we're ready for it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1775000","1776000"," Here's that downside target."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1776000","1777000"," Still haven't hit it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1777000","1779000"," Here's S2 down below."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1779000","1784000"," And I might, you know what I would do too is do you have telling you I would fucking buy calls down here too into tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1784000","1786000"," I'd load the fuck out of some calls there too."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1786000","1788000"," So either way, I don't give a fuck what they do here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1788000","1790000"," I'm going to get it careless."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1790000","1794000"," Yeah, Bob, put the stapler down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1794000","1796000"," Yeah, the grander scheme of things."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1796000","1799000"," If you're looking at like a 15 minute chart, I'm trying to buy calls down here, not puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1799000","1802000"," I have no interest in buying puts down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1802000","1803000"," None."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1803000","1805000"," All I want to do is buy calls to the upside."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1805000","1806000"," So I'm going to stick with that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1806000","1807000"," It's working quite well for me."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1807000","1810000"," So we're going to stick with any of these super lows and stuff like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1810000","1814000"," Just buying the dip and trying to get a 300% printer, some of them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1814000","1817000"," We'll see what's going on in this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1817000","1819000"," They have the low back here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1819000","1820000"," Target down below."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1820000","1821000"," We can do this close right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1821000","1822000"," Not looking good for bulls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1822000","1824000"," Not looking good for my calls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1824000","1826000"," It's a 15 24 right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1826000","1828000"," I got another 36 minutes."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1828000","1830000"," So I think that explains what the expectation."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1830000","1831000"," Let me go back over to the main screen."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1831000","1835000"," I think that explains the thought process for bulls and bears, bulls."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1835000","1845000"," I got to tell you man, if you're a bull, dude, like if you're a bull, dude, if you like try, if we bounce off for 26 or 427 or 420, you try telling me that we're going to go to all time highs."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1845000","1846000"," I'm going to laugh in your face."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1846000","1847000"," Maybe that ain't happening."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1847000","1848000"," Not enough time."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1848000","1855000"," So you better be praying to the Jerome God tomorrow that he makes this market rip faces up."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1855000","1857000"," I think that you get that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1857000","1859000"," I don't think Jerome wants this right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1859000","1860000"," I think it's too."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1860000","1866000"," My thesis here is that Jerome knows our Jerome won't be able to control what happens to the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1866000","1871000"," That's my thesis is that he knows that cuts are coming in 2024."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1871000","1880000"," I think here where we are, I was talking to my buddy Joe here and I'm like, I'm like, if we go from 433 to 350 is only 800 points."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1880000","1882000"," We can easily do that in seven months."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1882000","1885000"," We can, I think we do more than that in seven months."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1885000","1890000"," So six, seven hundred points down between September and February."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1890000","1895000"," It was September, November, December, January, February, March, April would be eight months."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1895000","1897000"," I'd expect the low and April, the actual low."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1898000","1899000"," Like 3,500."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1899000","1900000"," I'm like, yeah, maybe it's 32."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1900000","1901000"," Maybe it's 28."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1901000","1905000"," So we're going to know quite quickly that that thought process there too, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1905000","1910000"," As we come into tomorrow with Jerome, I want you to think about that thought process because what happens is."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1910000","1913000"," What happens is if Jerome doesn't save bulls, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1913000","1919000"," You're going to have a fundamental shift in the sentiment of the stock market tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1919000","1926000"," You'll have a fundamental shift and all those high targets that you have will shift to don't buy the market and wait until spring."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1926000","1927000"," Time of 2024."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1927000","1934000"," If you see that sentiment shift across the board from Jerome tomorrow to that negative, even if we squeeze, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1934000","1943000"," Even if we squeeze, even if we go up, if you see that sentiment shift, that major sentiment shift in the marketplace, you will never see that 4,800."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1943000","1945000"," We off the table for a long time."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1945000","1948000"," Like two, three years likely, something like that, possibly about two, three years, something like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1948000","1949000"," Year and a half, something like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1949000","1952000"," Maybe year, year, year and a half to three years."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1952000","1954000"," So we kind of fascinating to see what he says tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1954000","1956000"," I'm really fascinated to see what he says."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1956000","1960000"," If he is planning on that and into the election as well."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1960000","1961000"," So I'm fascinated by that too."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1961000","1963000"," I'm interested to see what he has to say."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1963000","1967000"," I'm interested to see if we go into the elections below 3,500."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1967000","1974000"," You start to get down to like the twenty sixes and the twenty eightes and you start to put pensions and 401ks on notice."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1974000","1976000"," You'll find like cities will go bankrupt and stuff like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1976000","1981000"," So I'd be fascinated to see that into the election season if that were to happen in the promises that would be made."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1982000","1985000"," With that, with that taking place into the election season."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1986000","1992000"," So right now that downside target for twenty four thirty eight seventeen is looking even more and more apparent as we get into this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1992000","1995000"," I got my calls are worth one penny right now, not even two."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1995000","1997000"," So I'm getting smoked here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1997000","1999000"," Still holding them into four fifteen."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","1999000","2001000"," I don't believe they're going to hold this down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2001000","2002000"," Maybe they will."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2002000","2005000"," Now there's a three hundred and twenty three thousand zero eight puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2005000","2007000"," Someone's buying the market here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2008000","2010000"," Three hundred and twenty one thousand puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2010000","2012000"," All zero dates."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2012000","2014000"," Twenty one thousand."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2016000","2017000"," All zero dates."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2017000","2018000"," Someone's buying the market today."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2019000","2021000"," Someone is buying the market today."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2022000","2025000"," What is that even equal to how many shares is that?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2026000","2028000"," Three hundred million shares something like that, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2029000","2030000"," We know the chat if I get that wrong."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2030000","2033000"," Someone's buying the spy for like three hundred million shares."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2033000","2034000"," Two day."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2035000","2036000"," So I have that right."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2036000","2037000"," I think so."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2037000","2038000"," Three hundred million, I think."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2041000","2042000"," That's what I think."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2042000","2043000"," Three hundred million."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2043000","2045000"," Three hundred million zero day puts going to expire in the money."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2045000","2046000"," So someone's buying the market here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2047000","2048000"," Someone someone's buying the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2048000","2049000"," I don't know who it is."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2050000","2051000"," Assuming this is Ackman."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2052000","2055000"," Get the side of Zachman or if it's a what's his name."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2056000","2057000"," If it's a."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2058000","2060000"," I can it's got to be I can because I can super bear, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2060000","2061000"," Maybe it's I can do it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2064000","2066000"," And if we get low enough into this close when it buys,"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2066000","2067000"," there are any calls in this too."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2072000","2073000"," Hold on a second here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2075000","2076000"," Yeah, that's why I think it is."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2076000","2077000"," I think it's I think it's uncle Carl."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2078000","2080000"," I guess it was if I had to guess it's uncle Carl."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2085000","2086000"," Someone's buying them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2086000","2088000"," Usually it's usually it's Carl."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2088000","2089000"," Carl likes to do the."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2090000","2091000"," Carl likes to sell puts to the."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2092000","2093000"," Like the sell puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2093000","2094000"," That's what I think."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2094000","2095000"," I think I think Carl."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2095000","2096000"," I think I can like to sell up though."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2096000","2099000"," Our car likes to buy the puts and Ackman likes to sell them, right?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2099000","2100000"," I think I think I got a reverse."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2104000","2105000"," Is it 32 million?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2105000","2107000"," I think it's higher at two zeros."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2107000","2109000"," So is it at two zeros?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2109000","2111000"," So three hundred twenty thousand."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2111000","2112000"," Yeah, you're maybe right."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2112000","2113000"," Thirty two million."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2113000","2116000"," Thirty two million shares at a three or four hundred thirty dollars."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2116000","2117000"," Man, I wish I was that that kind of money."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2118000","2120000"," I had that kind of fucking money and I fucking money."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2122000","2123000"," He's stoked."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2124000","2126000"," Can you imagine just being like, yeah, I'm going to need some liquidity."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2126000","2127000"," What do you need to do?"
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2127000","2128000"," Sell calls or sell puts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2128000","2129000"," Got it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2129000","2130000"," I'm all over it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2130000","2133000"," Like a dealer just calls you up and just says, hey, man, we need to need some liquidity for the market."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2133000","2135000"," People are too bullish and too bearish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2139000","2140000"," I did not I did not hear."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2140000","2142000"," Harker say that was we were listening to Harker on the stream this morning."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2144000","2145000"," I didn't hear that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2145000","2146000"," I think I might have heard it."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2146000","2148000"," I think we get the I think we get the."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2148000","2152000"," My take on Jerome is you get neutral and slightly dumbish."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2152000","2156000"," Like you have like the zero plus ten plus one."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2156000","2157000"," That's my take on."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2157000","2159000"," I don't think you get the Hark."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2160000","2162000"," I don't think you get the Hark bet that you think you're getting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2162000","2163000"," If you do, I'll be surprised."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2163000","2165000"," It would be like something I'm not expecting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2165000","2166000"," One hundred percent."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2167000","2170000"," My expectation is not the not the Hark that you think you're getting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2171000","2175000"," Yeah, I think you get the I don't think you get the stupid question answers either."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2175000","2176000"," I don't think that you do."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2177000","2180000"," I don't think you get like the like the like the neutral."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2180000","2185000"," I think you get the neutral Jerome, but I don't think you get like the like the Q and A where he's like."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2185000","2187000"," Yeah, we need more."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2187000","2188000"," We need more down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2188000","2189000"," I don't think you're going to get any of that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2189000","2190000"," We have more to do."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2190000","2191000"," Something like that."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2191000","2192000"," I think he's going to go back."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2192000","2196000"," I think he's going to take the victory lap and say we beat COVID."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2196000","2201000"," I think he says it takes that same bullshit victory victory lap that he took in the last rate decision."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2202000","2206000"," Just waiting for a squeeze here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2206000","2210000"," I'm going to have to add some more calls right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2218000","2220000"," Some more cheapies down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2220000","2221000"," Four cents, four forties."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2221000","2222000"," I'm going to add some of those."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2232000","2233000"," Just waiting here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2233000","2234000"," Give me one second."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2238000","2239000"," Still waiting here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2239000","2240000"," Coming into the half an hour now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2240000","2242000"," So I'm just going to give a quick second here and see what happens."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2243000","2245000"," H.Y.G closing last of their gap."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2245000","2246000"," Their last gap."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2246000","2248000"," Phil was 20, 74, 21."

"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2281000","2282000"," Vicks screaming higher right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2282000","2283000"," Vicks just exploding."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2283000","2284000"," I haven't bought any more calls here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2284000","2285000"," Just waiting."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2285000","2286000"," Looking for this big blast down here."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2286000","2287000"," Might get this blast down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2287000","2288000"," Might get that S2 target."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2288000","2289000"," Trade in four thirty eight."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2289000","2290000"," Four eighty eight."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2290000","2291000"," Actually, you're going to make us buy calls for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2291000","2292000"," If we go down."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2301000","2302000"," What did I say for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2302000","2303000"," Four forty four."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2303000","2304000"," Four forty three."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2304000","2305000"," Oh, they're not cheap for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2305000","2306000"," They're forty two cents."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2306000","2307000"," Whoo."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2307000","2308000"," I was going to add four forty C's."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2308000","2309000"," I'm not going to call that a dead trade for me."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2309000","2330000"," I'm going to lose my ass on this trade."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2330000","2331000"," I'm going to lose my ass."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2331000","2332000"," It was a small small."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2332000","2333000"," It was like fifty contracts."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2333000","2336000"," I'm going to add another two cents worth."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2336000","2340000"," I'm looking at four forty threes for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2340000","2341000"," Then this close."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2341000","2344000"," If we can get that gap closure down an apple into the spell."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2344000","2349000"," I'm going to move the target down here."

"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2356000","2361000"," Let me go down there."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2361000","2362000"," Trade in forty cents right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2362000","2363000"," Four forty three."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2363000","2364000"," I haven't bought them yet."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2364000","2365000"," I've got them lined up though."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2365000","2366000"," I might move them higher."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2366000","2368000"," If we can get like four forty ones to forty cents."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2368000","2370000"," They'll probably move them higher to four forty one."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2370000","2372000"," Four forty is our sixty one cents right now."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2372000","2376000"," We'll see what happens."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2376000","2377000"," Still haven't lined up though."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2377000","2378000"," Four forty three C for tomorrow."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2386000","2406000"," Trade in four thirty eight twenty seven."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2406000","2409000"," Now looking at four forty twos there fifty five cents."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2409000","2411000"," You don't want them at like forty or thirty."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2411000","2420000"," Now sitting on four forty two."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2420000","2436000"," Should come down here and target this four thirty seven."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2436000","2442000"," The gap closure on apple is one seventy five forty seven."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2442000","2443000"," You might buy a hundred of these fucking things."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2443000","2454000"," Not even not even fifty of them."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2454000","2458000"," A little bit more closing needed for apple apple has more down to go."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2458000","2463000"," One seventy five forty seven is the target for apple."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2463000","2481000"," I've got a huge bear cross on Nasdaq right now in a fifteen minute chart."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2481000","2486000"," Huge bear bear plane right now on Nasdaq."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2486000","2491000"," On the fifteen minute."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2491000","2496000"," Huge bear plane as well on NDX."
"mYsnDJ4zyQg","2496000","2502000"," Trading below the one hour twenty seven EMA it's extremely bearish."
