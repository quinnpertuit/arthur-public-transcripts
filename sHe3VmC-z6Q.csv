"110390","118670"," And my voice is kind of wrecked this morning. "
"120050","124430"," So you might hear me less than you normally would today."
"130630","131750"," Change that."
"131750","133950"," Think tight for just a second here. "

"305040","306160"," Tony Cheese, baby."
"307760","309100"," Callibcarian, Mr. Takamaki."
"311020","312020"," Thanks for subscribing. "
"312020","312780"," I appreciate it."
"313080","313520"," Fibonacho."
"313960","318880"," Thanks for, uh, Fibonach, zero or Fibonacho. "
"319740","320520"," I like your name, by the way."
"321740","322560"," Morning, princess."
"323400","324360"," Morning, theta slayer. "

"327620","328240"," Nacho, baby."
"328740","329040"," I like it."
"329380","330120"," Fibonacho, I dig it. "
"336300","339920"," So this morning, right off the bat, right off the bat this morning, we got to talk about a few"
"339920","340260"," things."
"341700","345300"," So some questions, do we not do we reload this this morning or not?"
"346000","347120"," We'll take a look around the market."
"347280","349300"," There's a few, few notes for today. "
"349460","351360"," We're coming into quad-witching."
"352040","353800"," We're coming into mopex, right?"
"354200","355480"," Mopex, it's just today."
"358800","361700"," And the ranges are large today. "
"362400","370940"," So where the options market, the implied move market doesn't really imply us to move a lot today."
"373980","376000"," Our pivots, though, do."
"377020","383480"," Our pivots have us with an R3 of 409.50. And it being mopex is important to this. "
"384040","384840"," That's a big part of this."
"384840","389300"," So I was kind of surprised this morning with our pivot points."
"389340","390460"," They're quite large. "
"390540","393740"," You're talking 409.74 on the high."
"394840","397040"," And then some real danger zones down below."
"397420","397620"," 379. "
"398680","402580"," I was making a comment on Twitter this morning that collapsed our prolapse bears."
"402900","404700"," They want to get down here."
"404940","406260"," And it's on the chart at least. "
"407320","409260"," 379.32 for a low."
"410160","411820"," So there could be some big moves today."
"411820","415720"," And we may gain some insight as to which way it's going. "
"417520","427220"," From, believe it or not, the tech market could give us some kind of an indication as to where we're"
"427220","427480"," going."
"430180","431680"," At least today or Monday."
"432520","436400"," I remember I'm expecting my expectation here is that we close on a high today. "
"436660","439120"," That's, that's my like, Hey, this is where we should close."
"439840","445500"," If we start to close the week down on a low, it's going to set up today for me would"
"445500","449160"," be more of a wait and see what happens today."
"449600","455020"," We close on a high at 400 or we close on a load at 380 because it sets up next"
"455020","455340"," week. "
"456340","459700"," So I'm mostly interested in where do we go from here?"
"459920","462440"," Now bears have something on their side today."
"463120","470160"," And that is that tech is closing on a high closing the week on a high and video is closing"
"470160","471720"," on a high apple."
"472060","477820"," You know, you saw yesterday in apple and so you want to see where they closed today. "
"477900","478260"," It's important."
"478260","483660"," And I don't know if it's today or if it's Monday where they come back down."
"484140","484820"," We're going to look at there. "
"484860","486180"," They're at some resistance levels."
"486400","491280"," We'll take a look specifically at some tech stocks today and see where they're sitting."
"491660","497720"," You saw apple yesterday was was messing with its three time previous high. "
"498660","503480"," So we'll take a look at those those stocks today and see if they give us any insight into where"
"503480","504160"," the week closes."
"504820","507540"," You saw TLT rip and face this morning."
"508140","510380"," H Y G pre market wasn't down. "
"510820","514919"," So that is that that's going against what?"
"517020","519120"," What the spy was saying this morning, right?"
"519340","520780"," Yes, though, was on a high this morning."
"521000","527240"," If you saw if you if you watch ES overnight, it actually tagged the high that spy should have"
"527240","528000"," tagged yesterday."
"528780","532800"," Whereas when spy was selling off, he asked was like, mooning this morning. "
"535280","536620"," So take a look at that this morning."
"536780","541460"," I'd like to see this open up is one of those days on a mopex or my preferences to watch"
"541460","543560"," the market open up and tell me where we're going."
"543760","552420"," Now with that said, with that said, we can take a look at where we are and and kind"
"552420","555220"," of figure out where we're going, right?"
"555220","558180"," You can see right here that the market is not telling you anything in a one minute chart. "
"558900","561420"," You've got a little bit of a cross going on here on the bear side."
"564160","565700"," If you look at pre market here."
"573310","576370"," If you look at pre market here, it's not really showing you too much the moment. "
"581040","582200"," Price is prices."
"582660","588920"," It's not quite failing yet, but it is showing this can hold and start to show that we're going up."
"588920","593280"," We'll take a long here, but at the moment, it's just opening up. "
"593380","594960"," But this looks like mopex shit."
"595200","600160"," So for myself, I wouldn't take a position here."
"600240","603640"," I'm waiting here to see what what the market's starting to show us, right?"
"604000","604440"," Let it open up. "
"604540","604900"," Let it develop."
"607500","609280"," But it is going to be interesting to see where we go today."
"609680","615000"," This is going to kind of set up next week, set up FMC. "
"615000","623100"," We know that the banks are the placard that I have this morning is about Jerome Powell and him back"
"623100","626980"," stopping the market, specifically the banks and the importance of that."
"627740","631380"," It's kind of telling you that it's telling you that the Fed has your back."
"635340","639000"," Bank is toxic to let it burn, but the Fed has your back right now. "
"639700","641440"," So that's an important thing to know as well."
"641440","645580"," We'll talk this morning about FMC rate hikes."
"646280","653120"," We'll be able to discuss in the chat today what people's expectations are for different paths for"
"653120","653380"," the Fed. "
"653960","658000"," So if the Fed pauses, if the Fed cuts, well, I guess we'll look at it."
"658100","659340"," If the Fed cuts what to expect."
"659940","661680"," If the Fed pauses what to expect. "
"662840","665640"," If the Fed continues at its current rate."
"666260","668720"," A path, maybe 25 BPS."
"669180","672340"," Where are we going to surprise 50 BPS and maybe a pause. "
"674060","676800"," So we'll look at all of those options for the Fed next week."
"677420","681060"," We know what the what's being priced in is some kind of a pause or cut."
"681680","683600"," That's being priced in the market right now. "
"683760","686080"," The banks are kind of for telling you."
"687640","689200"," That's probably happening."
"701590","702470"," I love it. "
"702730","703530"," I love that name."
"704830","707090"," More than everybody."
"711350","712630"," Nvidia's lost its mind. "
"713370","717930"," There's, you know, there's some aspects to what's happening."
"718170","719650"," I mean, the market right now."
"719810","725990"," I don't know if you can see this fully, but the market right now is extremely dangerous. "
"727570","730570"," With wild movements and mechanics going on in the background."
"730990","735710"," That don't they don't necessarily say we're going to have a crash."
"737870","739930"," But they're they're trading like it, right?"
"742730","743870"," They're trading like it. "
"744850","747890"," Market cycles are showing move into tech."
"748470","752050"," It's really bizarre too because it's it's almost showing like a setup for Spyder Crash."
"752050","756350"," And let's say let's say Apple comes down and video comes down. "
"756630","758230"," But how far do they come down?"
"758370","760890"," Maybe they come down 130 bucks like Apple maybe 130 bucks."
"761570","764630"," So you'd have money safe safely stored away in there."
"765010","767630"," And they'll they'll allow the rest of this to fall off. "
"776880","777900"," You rage quit."
"779620","783480"," Be like the unusual Wells discord or book map discord or something."
"785580","790000"," The reason I was asking if you were in our discord was because there are some traders in there that"
"790000","790960"," are willing to help you out. "
"791660","792560"," They offered yesterday."
"795260","797460"," Your wife's boyfriend offered to give you a hand."
"797900","806180"," So if you're looking for to spend some time with some traders, they're offering to give you a hand. "
"813840","815340"," Yeah, maybe St. Patty's Day."
"815700","816320"," Triple witchers."
"817480","818260"," Quad witching. "
"819880","823380"," It's kind of still quad witching in a way, but not really anymore, right?"
"828030","829190"," Yeah, commodities are down."
"829750","830230"," Yes, sir."
"831730","835430"," Trading like a it's trading like a bottom of some kind, right?"
"835550","836610"," The question is price, I guess. "
"840040","841020"," Yeah, more than that."
"841100","846220"," Yeah, there's some blow off this blow off."
"846320","849160"," There's some blow off to the day. "
"850040","850420"," Definitely."
"851340","853260"," For the week, at least the last past couple weeks."
"858020","860460"," Yeah, I think I don't know if we're too early to then. "
"860720","862000"," Let's take a look at NVIDIA real quick."
"864970","865930"," It's a good one to look at."
"868330","869770"," Let's take a look at NVIDIA real quick. "
"871130","876830"," And you can see this is kind of not shocked at this at all right here in which has happened"
"876830","877390"," on NVIDIA."
"881720","885160"," And why would that be just let's look at NVIDIA really quick."
"891440","894300"," Not shocked at that slop down on NVIDIA on the open at all. "
"897260","899320"," So someone's saying too early to short NVIDIA."
"899780","900520"," I don't believe so."
"901800","903320"," I don't believe it's too early to short NVIDIA. "
"904480","909600"," And the reason I don't think it's too short, too early to short NVIDIA is the scene of the crime"
"909600","910080"," right here."
"914770","916250"," Let's see where we are right now."
"918770","919890"," Try to sneak it up. "
"921330","922630"," Let's see NVIDIA right here."
"922770","923750"," They're trying to sneak this up."
"923970","924950"," Left that huge gap behind. "
"925630","928390"," Another huge gap below here left behind."
"929050","935210"," And the sellers came right in this morning to sell 263.49 on that squeeze higher."
"939880","941820"," And there's another key here to look at. "
"942960","944840"," And that's right back here."
"950380","951700"," That's where it was sold before."
"952680","953860"," Now these are where the sellers were. "
"953860","956660"," It sold 285ish."
"957240","958180"," I call it 290."
"959240","961760"," And this is where the real bloodbath started right in here. "
"962620","967100"," So they started raining this down on sellers stepped right in and raining this down."
"967320","973160"," So you're going to expect naturally sellers to re-step in there to short."
"973940","976800"," It was a natural place to short NVIDIA. "
"978080","979680"," And so it's not unexpected."
"980180","983400"," These two yellow lines right here is where they shorted it on the open this morning."
"983400","990220"," And it's not to be unexpected to see short sellers step in here again for their short. "
"990720","996600"," So that gives me a look towards the rest of today at least to say, yeah, they're going to try"
"996600","997360"," to sell NVIDIA."
"997640","998600"," They're going to try to sell these highs."
"999480","1000600"," Apple is the same thing. "
"1002240","1007720"," There's my one concern about today is do these sellers step in on these stocks heading into next"
"1007720","1007980"," week?"
"1010320","1011800"," And we'll look at Apple."
"1014980","1017660"," And you see this high right here."
"1020100","1023660"," Sold this right here sold this right here and sold this right here. "
"1024440","1026920"," And we get kind of the same thing today."
"1027140","1029359"," But Apple's looking very bullish here, isn't it?"
"1029980","1033700"," Apple's looking like it wants to just squeeze like straight up, right?"
"1034000","1035180"," Like violently squeeze up."
"1035940","1037800"," They're getting kind of mixed signals here, right?"
"1037800","1039640"," Apple actually looks pretty to me. "
"1039740","1047359"," It looks it looks squeezy where NVIDIA looks kind of topish to me or an expectation of topishness"
"1047359","1049540"," on Apple or on NVIDIA."
"1049560","1055680"," Apple looks like this thing could move up to like a hundred and seventy in a day, doesn't it?"
"1055680","1059100"," So just just kind of weird weird charts all over the place."
"1059480","1061300"," So we'll look at both of these. "
"1069170","1076250"," We have both of these on a better time for our on a velocity in the triggers."
"1077190","1079510"," And Apple looks pretty bullish here, right?"
"1079810","1081370"," Can't say that Apple doesn't look bullish."
"1083410","1084530"," Hang tight here. "
"1084890","1086130"," I'm going to move some stuff out way here."
"1087110","1087650"," Not out of the way."
"1091760","1093160"," Apple's looking pretty bullish here, right?"
"1093260","1094860"," At least today it's showing itself as bullish. "
"1095200","1098040"," The daily velocity though is not good for Apple."
"1098040","1101000"," So the daily velocity has come down for Apple."
"1102000","1108860"," See if we can get the hourly velocity has a little bit more push to it. "
"1109300","1111140"," But it's starting to come off a run, right?"
"1111300","1119560"," You can see the hourly kind of coming off even with some what looks like bullishness on Apple,"
"1119740","1119820"," right?"
"1119980","1122940"," Because Apple looks to me looks bullish where NVIDIA doesn't."
"1123120","1125600"," NVIDIA looks like it's just a natural place to sell into."
"1127460","1131160"," Apple looks bullish, but it's daily and hourly is not bullish. "
"1133060","1138680"," So it's telling me that Apple could be weak today, even though it looks like it could squeeze face"
"1138680","1139900"," off today."
"1141040","1141520"," NVIDIA?"
"1145660","1146360"," Look at that."
"1146700","1147860"," You didn't video, dude. "
"1148420","1152300"," I mean, this reminds me of dot com."
"1153180","1157300"," You come in and you come in the next day and it's like up three, three percent, five percent."
"1157300","1158760"," Something just absurd. "
"1159840","1161500"," Just squeezing faces off."
"1165060","1169000"," NVIDIA losing declining volume here, but squeezing, right?"
"1169840","1173120"," Usually when you see something like this, it's ready to roll over."
"1175000","1177220"," Although it's starting to get bullish again, right?"
"1177480","1177920"," See it right here?"
"1178340","1179980"," Starting to pick back up right here, bullishness. "
"1181020","1183220"," This thing could just keep squeezing, right?"
"1183320","1185040"," I guess that's the intent that it keeps squeezing."
"1185040","1186440"," But we're losing a little bit here."
"1186440","1189500"," It's starting to top out, starting to get a little toppy here. "
"1192540","1202040"," My expectation on NVIDIA would be keep squeezing and keep selling into it in that"
"1202040","1203140"," squeezingness of NVIDIA."
"1203640","1203900"," Tesla?"
"1208070","1209890"," Kind of sketchy here, right?"
"1210310","1211530"," Tesla's kind of sketchy."
"1211650","1218930"," So Tesla is in this place where we're either going to get a reversal in trend or we just stay"
"1218930","1221310"," on that down trend down here on Tesla. "
"1223490","1224270"," Right there."
"1224670","1226710"," Very, very dangerous place here for Tesla."
"1227790","1234210"," Though if Tesla is able to break above, it's very bullish for Tesla. "
"1235030","1236690"," So we'll keep an eye on Tesla today as well."
"1237470","1245580"," Tesla would need to break above 185, 26 for Tesla."
"1246880","1248520"," It would be a very important thing for Tesla to do. "
"1248520","1258460"," And we also have this weekly at 194.19. Just look at this back here a"
"1258460","1258760"," little bit."
"1259780","1265560"," And this monthly, this has actually been with a place where real sellers have come in on Tesla"
"1265560","1266480"," right above here."
"1269690","1271150"," But this yellow line is important. "
"1271410","1275610"," This yellow line determines day to day, week to week trend for Tesla."
"1275610","1279090"," So we're going to watch this to see if Tesla can actually get above."
"1279410","1282970"," If it can, I would really like to see it try to trade 220. "
"1284190","1285050"," Maybe not 220."
"1285470","1286530"," Let's call it a 212."
"1288230","1288930"," Maybe 210. "
"1290110","1291850"," 210 if Tesla can trade above 189."
"1294170","1297530"," So we'll give that to, what is that, another 20 points for Tesla?"
"1298690","1299770"," Possibly squeeze higher."
"1300410","1301670"," So we'll watch Tesla closely as well. "
"1301670","1308090"," We don't want to see Tesla price go below showing like a market rule over though, right?"
"1308270","1313830"," Right now at the moment Tesla's dangerous to rolling over here."
"1314630","1316570"," You can see the sellers initially came in here."
"1316830","1322490"," They're more than likely going to want to re-step in over here and continue trending down to the"
"1322490","1323390"," downside over here. "
"1325630","1326610"," Right down there."
"1328010","1332190"," I'm going to assume that the Fibonacci boys are watching Tesla closely as well."
"1337240","1338800"," I would take this trade though. "
"1338860","1347160"," If you can take this trade above, you can get long in Tesla today above 185.54. With a stop"
"1347160","1347780"," right below it."
"1349380","1351660"," If you're a Tesla bull, you'd want to see price come up."
"1352060","1352420"," Squeeze higher. "
"1353260","1356900"," Come back down and check 185 and have it alert on it twice today."
"1357800","1360600"," Squeeze is up and over and wins its check."
"1361840","1364240"," That'd be a great trade right there for Tesla. "
"1364880","1366920"," But only if it gets above that 185 and change."
"1368020","1369380"," 25, 47 or so."
"1373220","1375660"," Then we get some basket stock work going on today. "
"1384010","1385330"," It's spy squeezing right now."
"1386250","1388110"," It's a positive bullish here."
"1394370","1396250"," A lot of stocks look like they're squeezy. "
"1398810","1401210"," A lot of squeeziness going on the market here."
"1402350","1405430"," Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe I'll change my opinion."
"1405710","1408610"," So maybe you just get lots of squeeziness today. "
"1409410","1412550"," And a month and a quarter."
"1413330","1415970"," Can we just squeeze the fuck out of the market here at the 400?"
"1416790","1417890"," This is what I want to see."
"1418890","1421750"," I want to see that 400 and a month and a quarter. "
"1422290","1427830"," Not leave the market down at 380 with a doom and gloom into the Fed meeting."
"1428630","1431230"," I think it would panic markets too."
"1432170","1433470"," A month like the Fed. "
"1433830","1436310"," I don't think that they want to panic markets into the Fed meeting."
"1437430","1441010"," We got some big or really high resistances here."
"1441610","1443790"," 409, 403, 399. "
"1444110","1444970"," Our one is only 399."
"1447640","1449640"," Some gaps to close above up here."
"1475570","1476690"," Nice development on. "
"1478790","1479870"," It's looking bullish here."
"1479870","1480970"," It's looking really nice."
"1481150","1483030"," Nice little, just nice little close right here. "
"1483150","1484250"," It's a five minute chart right now."
"1486070","1488850"," We want to see something like this develop here."
"1494710","1496810"," We got a nice little cross right here. "
"1496910","1501170"," Some, some kind of a confirmation that we're going up."
"1503310","1507210"," I want to make sure these sellers aren't just stepping in here in the squeeze, right?"
"1507530","1510750"," We want to watch this closely here and see if we can maybe come over here."
"1510750","1513110"," Test this one minute again and start running. "
"1518140","1520080"," Makes me want to grab some calls right now."
"1552600","1553360"," All right."
"1556730","1559990"," We got some 395 C's. "
"1561790","1563250"," We can close these gaps up here."
"1563350","1564490"," Close this PT up here."
"1565250","1566670"," If I have to, I'll add back over here. "
"1576500","1578040"," PT one above right there."
"1586940","1593260"," Now trade $1.21. I got in at $1.05. I'm going to have to add some more back down"
"1593260","1593420"," here."
"1593560","1594620"," Didn't get good positioning. "
"1595740","1599580"," If we have to come back down here as I grab them again maybe and maybe jump in at 75"
"1599580","1601840"," cents or something and just PCA into them."
"1611620","1614620"," Yeah, they all look like everything looks like it can squeeze up today."
"1615300","1616940"," We just squeeze straight up in the end of the day. "
"1619360","1621000"," They have the same patties day, Binky."
"1626550","1628930"," Peter Thierryl calls this SVB failure."
"1630270","1631710"," My phone's been off too. "
"1631830","1634590"," I haven't had my phone on, so I haven't seen anyone's text messages."
"1639660","1641020"," The Apple's looking squeezy."
"1641500","1642560"," Tesla's looking squeezy. "
"1644580","1645900"," Nvidia keeps squeezing into sellers."
"1650470","1651410"," You got the same patties day."
"1662240","1670860"," My thought here is that I'm just going to add calls down here at $3.93.23. I'll hold them"
"1670860","1671600"," until end of the day. "
"1673560","1675080"," I don't think I'm going to get out of them."
"1675140","1677500"," I'm just going to buy them, hold them, and just wait for end of day here."
"1680980","1683120"," Watch them squeeze up into $400 in the close. "
"1683680","1685100"," That's what I think we're going to do."
"1688650","1690270"," Just squeeze right into the close today."
"1690270","1691890"," That's what I think is going to happen. "
"1694770","1696470"," This is the spy on a one minute."
"1698510","1699490"," There's a one minute chart."
"1699830","1701330"," Here's the five minute chart right here. "
"1702730","1705530"," Waiting for a little bit more confirmation over here for the move of hire."
"1706770","1707510"," Trying to see."
"1711770","1714710"," I want to see this white line right here come up. "
"1717790","1720090"," I want to see this red line right here."
"1721250","1722770"," Just chill out back here."
"1724930","1727790"," Then I want to see price stay above. "
"1728190","1729510"," I want to see price stay right here."
"1730110","1731250"," Confirm that we're going higher."
"1734010","1735350"," I'm looking for right now. "
"1736250","1736970"," Something like that."
"1739830","1741970"," Hopefully we squeeze right up into the close today."
"1755850","1756530"," Good morning. "
"1757910","1759170"," Yeah, BTC is ripping."
"1760570","1762910"," It looks like the Fed is back stopping here."
"1764950","1766470"," We'll talk about the. "
"1768130","1770410"," The rates for next week as well."
"1770590","1771710"," I'm interested maybe to put a."
"1772450","1774050"," A poll or two out today."
"1775050","1775710"," There's winky here. "
"1775770","1777130"," I don't know if winky's here right now or not."
"1779070","1780190"," See if winky's in the house."
"1786880","1788380"," We can maybe take him the day off today. "
"1791220","1791820"," Let me see."
"1808760","1810520"," Yeah, Jill's saying notoriously choppy."
"1811200","1814020"," Yeah, I think the what they're going to do is sell into strength today. "
"1815800","1817580"," I think they'll sell into rips."
"1818540","1821240"," I think they'll squeeze higher and they're going to sell on a rips and then the end of day."
"1823460","1824680"," Positioning short in the next week. "
"1843380","1845380"," How does someone join the discord?"
"1845720","1848700"," Let's see if we can get your wife's boyfriend maybe to post a link to discord."
"1858990","1859670"," Here we go."
"1859810","1861070"," Yes, female just popped in. "
"1861870","1862510"," Let's a legend."
"1862830","1864910"," Just did it a exclamation point with a discord."
"1865150","1866590"," See if you can get into discord there or not. "
"1866950","1868410"," The link may or may not be good."
"1869910","1875950"," You can buy this right here."
"1876050","1878250"," Hold on. "
"1885640","1887560"," I'm on 29 on 395 C."
"1905370","1905810"," Gotcha."
"1907310","1910730"," You know, I think we had 50 people join discord yesterday."
"1911990","1915090"," It went a lot of a lot of discord joiners. "
"1921130","1922590"," How many days do I play out?"
"1922830","1924310"," So we used to trade."
"1924570","1926150"," We used to trade a one minute chart here."
"1926250","1928430"," So we're trying to trade now is higher time frames. "
"1929430","1933510"," Like a five minute chart using an hourly and four and a daily basically."
"1934690","1936730"," Daily charts just to find trend."
"1937270","1939770"," Right now, there's no real trend here. "
"1939970","1942470"," You can see that sellers will look at SPX real quick."
"1942550","1943430"," We'll do this on SPX."
"1945710","1948230"," Just look at SPX making nice and easier. "
"1949950","1952030"," There's no trend for bulls yet."
"1952730","1954150"," Technically, this is a daily chart right here."
"1954770","1955790"," Bulls need to. "
"1957470","1961070"," So let's say you let's say you want to take a trade with us and safety."
"1961450","1962070"," Some kind of safety."
"1962370","1963450"," Just we're just looking at SPX. "
"1963450","1967250"," SPX needs to trade higher above four thousand."
"1968490","1971390"," To take any kind of trade with confidence."
"1972330","1974150"," If you want to confidence trade in the spot. "
"1976370","1978450"," Their fighting for bulls are fighting for right now."
"1981470","1983210"," That would be where this white line comes up."
"1983370","1989010"," This red line stays under and price is able to get if price is able to get above. "
"1989850","1992790"," This daily trend and start to start to squeeze higher here."
"1995110","1996210"," That's not a daily, right?"
"1996470","1997350"," Daily trend chart."
"1999470","2000950"," Now, until what I'm in here. "
"2001530","2003130"," I don't know what that is."
"2004730","2005170"," Okay."
"2008730","2009970"," So bulls are fighting for that. "
"2010330","2013910"," The question here becomes does the weekly."
"2014410","2015570"," This is a weekly bar."
"2015730","2016730"," The weekly bar is right here. "
"2018390","2019750"," And you can even see it right here."
"2019890","2021370"," Right above here, 39775."
"2022090","2023490"," Bulls want to close above this. "
"2023490","2028250"," It's really the only thing bulls have going for them to make this trend higher."
"2028810","2033010"," If they can't get this here to close out the week, it's pretty bearish."
"2033010","2036690"," It's going to be looking like it wants to start really selling off down here. "
"2037150","2040810"," So I traded yesterday at the end of the bid day was to put a putback spread on and chase"
"2040810","2041450"," the market higher."
"2042690","2047290"," That's really the only trade you can take here is a putback spread."
"2048090","2050570"," An anticipation of closing the week on the negative. "
"2052150","2056590"," There can be some argument made on the weekly that is not that we're bullish."
"2056590","2065530"," If we just close above 393, 4.27. So 39 3.427. I guess you could you could claim that."
"2065730","2068909"," Maybe it's sets up for next week for for OPEC's. "
"2069650","2070730"," Of this range right here."
"2071830","2075429"," And then leaving open the possibility of rate increases."
"2076070","2081810"," Or a fed cut to show us direction if we're going to bloodbath this down or start to continue"
"2081810","2082050"," higher. "
"2083590","2084510"," So 393."
"2085530","2093130"," 3 3.05 would be the low close for today and then the high close today 397435."
"2095469","2096750"," That's SPX at least. "
"2111390","2114310"," Bear is trying to throw this over right now selling into strength."
"2114310","2116150"," You can see him coming right in."
"2116210","2120290"," I'm assuming that they're doing this on NDX or an Apple and on NAS or on a."
"2122710","2123230"," Nvidia. "
"2135080","2137340"," Michigan's consumer sentiment surprised the downside."
"2137780","2138180"," Yeah, I'm not."
"2139200","2140580"," Michigan consumer sentiment. "
"2140880","2141000"," I'm like."
"2142440","2142960"," Like."
"2147940","2153450"," Yeah, I'm looking more for end of day. "
"2153610","2155550"," I think an update for me is going to be the."
"2157070","2158530"," Day for me is going to be the."
"2159810","2161890"," I want to see what the closing prices for next week. "
"2166290","2167450"," Oh, yeah, they're selling this news."
"2167870","2168330"," I gotcha."
"2169290","2171170"," Yeah, we're we have a bearish cross right now. "
"2171170","2177830"," I think my so like my whole take right now is closing price on Friday."
"2179730","2182170"," It's all been waiting for all week long is what it was."
"2182330","2184030"," What do we close the price at today?"
"2193600","2198040"," Any thoughts on you've got Eugene parks asking any thoughts on spine cues being. "
"2198200","2198820"," So diverged."
"2198920","2200060"," I've only been trading for a couple of years."
"2200200","2201660"," I don't recall seeing them diverge as much. "
"2202280","2202720"," Recently."
"2204020","2207720"," Setting up the market is setting up a classic signs."
"2208820","2211440"," Of us trying to find a bottom in the market. "
"2211440","2213280"," Now that doesn't include price."
"2214300","2216360"," This looks like we're going to have a crash."
"2218000","2219500"," The spy at least does. "
"2219960","2222560"," And the tech does as well."
"2223080","2224240"," So the idea here would be."
"2224900","2228740"," If I have to have exposure in the market, that's in a bank and I have to have exposure in"
"2228740","2229060"," the market. "
"2231200","2232460"," So we had Apple real quick."
"2232780","2233120"," So."
"2234660","2235940"," Probably should say this. "
"2236880","2238840"," Probably should probably say this here."
"2239000","2239480"," Hold on a second here."
"2240120","2241580"," So I want to show you Apple here. "
"2242940","2243580"," Fairly easy."
"2243760","2244780"," There's a daily chart on Apple."
"2244920","2245040"," Okay. "
"2245640","2246560"," So if I'm a bank."
"2247660","2252300"," And I know that we're at the end or the beginnings of the next market cycle."
"2252300","2255840"," So I know I'm like, Hey, we're coming to a bottom in the market. "
"2256680","2260560"," And I know that I have to switch over to."
"2261800","2264560"," Tech exposure to tech, because that was that is the first."
"2265460","2268980"," That is the first part of a new cycle is tech. "
"2269740","2272220"," So let's say I'm down here at 123 bucks, right?"
"2272540","2274420"," This is back in January, first of the year."
"2276380","2277420"," So I buy tech."
"2277700","2277820"," Okay. "
"2278780","2280340"," Knowing a new cycle is coming."
"2280780","2285120"," If I don't have 23 bucks, first thing I do, they have by tech."
"2287340","2288740"," Now they run tech up. "
"2290800","2292680"," Knowing that we're coming to the end."
"2293760","2295060"," Oh, the cycle, right?"
"2295280","2296720"," And that's the beginnings of a new cycle."
"2297340","2300980"," So let's say they let's say they sell spy down to the depths of hell. "
"2302200","2304740"," In Apple, let's say, falls to 123."
"2304740","2307320"," And let's say spy goes to 2,800."
"2309420","2312340"," So this is regardless of spy goes to 200 or not. "
"2312520","2315420"," So spy goes to 200 or spy just starts going up into the right."
"2316900","2319500"," They're already long here in an Apple, right?"
"2319780","2320720"," At 123 bucks."
"2321620","2324340"," If spy and Apple roll over, they've lost nothing. "
"2324720","2325300"," Does that make sense?"
"2326180","2331440"," This is kind of showing you that banks at least institutions don't care."
"2332240","2336180"," Institutions are like, we're long tech for the next, the start of the next cycle."
"2337040","2342460"," And even if the market crashes and let's say it takes Apple with it, Apple's not going below 123 in"
"2342460","2343840"," our minds unless there's something. "
"2345780","2347720"," Systemically wrong with our market."
"2348760","2349580"," Something systemic."
"2350520","2355000"," And so we had the question last week of, is there contagion in banks?"
"2355680","2358900"," And the Fed said, that fuck you, we're going to back banks no matter what. "
"2359060","2359680"," We've got the banks."
"2359900","2363320"," We've got to put on the banking system."
"2364260","2370460"," So when that's what that's telling you is that there's no systemic risk that's known right now in"
"2370460","2370880"," the markets. "
"2370880","2375180"," The banks are the fed is going to back the banks."
"2382980","2385920"," Get some coffee here."
"2391860","2397700"," Now, if you look at the Fed funds rate, we're talking some big macro stuff here. "
"2397780","2399700"," We're not talking like dividend day."
"2399900","2400720"," We're not talking about."
"2402920","2403420"," Gamma. "
"2403900","2405780"," We're not talking about any of this small time stuff."
"2405960","2408580"," We're talking about the Fed funds rate being paused."
"2408580","2412580"," We're talking about the yields rolling over. "
"2412780","2415840"," We're talking about unemployment rate, like kind of bottom and coming up."
"2416400","2419220"," We're talking about inflation coming down."
"2419860","2422700"," We're talking about market cycles that last years. "
"2424080","2427420"," So you're seeing that right now playing out in the marketplace."
"2427900","2429180"," You're seeing tech being bought."
"2429720","2432740"," You're seeing XLU being bought right and being supported. "
"2433300","2435140"," You're starting to see this stuff and you're like eh."
"2436320","2438840"," And spy really hasn't hit its bottom yet."
"2439160","2444260"," So you've seen spy being a tamp down held down shorted in the market, right?"
"2444780","2451460"," And this is market participants like let's say I'm a bank and I bought apple and I bought XLU,"
"2451460","2452360"," let's say utilities. "
"2453060","2455000"," And now I have to hedge all of this stuff."
"2455640","2456800"," So I'm going to hedge spy."
"2463080","2464820"," This is like big money, right?"
"2465360","2467400"," You saw this in XLF 2."
"2467500","2474340"," XLF got bought, bought, bought big buys, like 60, 70 million buys on some of these companies. "
"2474700","2478440"," You had Jamie Diamond in a meeting yesterday with Janet Yellen."
"2478940","2480040"," These people all know each other."
"2480680","2481720"," They all know what's going on. "
"2481860","2482580"," They all know what's happening."
"2488720","2489900"," They're all buddies and friends."
"2502130","2503810"," I'm drinking some coffee here. "
"2507440","2509780"," So the idea here is to hedge the market, right?"
"2509960","2510400"," You hedge spy."
"2511140","2516780"," And you should have been long in tech and XLU heading into, heading into."
"2522060","2523160"," I'm going to get some of this coffee. "
"2523360","2523600"," It's good."
"2528800","2530720"," See your long, your long tech, right?"
"2531320","2534920"," And then you've got people that are coming in to try to sell tech into this Friday and in a"
"2534920","2535960"," month for next week."
"2538580","2542760"," So I don't think that there's, who hasn't read this. "
"2551530","2552330"," Oh, dude, who's."
"2558020","2558380"," Crazy."
"2562540","2562900"," Sweet. "
"2580860","2582420"," It's too late to get in a tech now."
"2582580","2583080"," You can't."
"2583980","2585840"," See, you can't buy tech now. "
"2586120","2588480"," The banks are in a, it's like Apple, the banks are in at 123."
"2589400","2592220"," So there's like, you can't really get into tech right now."
"2594940","2597020"," You're kind of like waiting to get into tech. "
"2598820","2601100"," They have spy rolls over in the next couple of weeks."
"2601700","2602520"," We're going to talk about that today."
"2602660","2607520"," So we get, we're going to talk about the effect meeting and what the implication is, right?"
"2608560","2610320"," Maybe we talked about this all week long too. "
"2611600","2613760"," So if the market starts to sell off."
"2614400","2618120"," And it's in anticipation of a pause or a rate cut."
"2618700","2621860"," If it has that one last plunge lower and through the trough. "
"2622700","2626080"," You'd then enter Apple, let's say at 123 bucks."
"2627280","2629380"," Or 135 or whatever it is."
"2648990","2650630"," Does that make sense in the next week?"
"2651610","2654490"," And what we should talk about that too, because we're talking about. "
"2656870","2659070"," The Fed meeting, it's going to be an important meeting."
"2661450","2662730"," I'm going to be looking for."
"2666400","2670240"," If there's a Fed put on the banks, if there's an end to rate hikes. "
"2673060","2675100"," Now, do they front run a bottom into the market?"
"2675760","2678540"," It looks like the banks are positioned for that to happen."
"2678820","2682040"," It doesn't mean that it happens, but it does mean that."
"2683060","2685280"," It does mean that we're positioned for it. "
"2686720","2689020"," So if you look at SPX, let's look at SPX real quick."
"2689240","2690360"," Again, we'll go back to SPX."
"2698140","2699220"," Here it is right here. "
"2701460","2703300"," This is basically the path right now."
"2708520","2709760"," We've got two paths there."
"2710760","2714560"," We've got the, we've got the, hey, we're going to have a capitulation moment. "
"2716460","2720140"," Or we're just going to continue about our business up into the right."
"2720140","2722440"," This is the, this is the no landing path."
"2723940","2724640"," Right here. "
"2725060","2728580"," And this is the, the, the one last capitulation move landing."
"2728840","2730520"," So banks are fine right now, right?"
"2731000","2736960"," You can hedge, you can hedge spy right now for that no landing scenario with putback spreads."
"2738600","2744120"," And long the market, if they continue up higher, even with those putback spreads. "
"2744400","2746280"," Like putback spreads are kind of the trade right now."
"2753450","2755970"," And let's, let's say Apple's up here."
"2756210","2760050"," So let's say Apple comes down, slams down here, and spy is actually down here. "
"2760150","2760590"," Does that make sense?"
"2763070","2768090"," So if you wanted to, if you wanted to long Apple, you'd probably be waiting the long tech."
"2769610","2771350"," The trade already happened beginning of the year."
"2773210","2776510"," And coincidentally, you see Tesla looks like spy, right?"
"2776910","2778930"," Kind of weak, kind of like in code go down farther. "
"2781130","2791620"," This is"
"2791620","2792640"," a daily chart right here."
"2792720","2799160"," You see that nice white curve coming over trying to sell Tesla or it's SPX down to find a market"
"2799160","2799560"," low."
"2817190","2819590"," Here's your pre market low, 390 83. "
"2850190","2852210"," Tesla trading below it's hourly right now."
"2862260","2862940"," Who's that?"
"2863080","2864160"," Who said about VIX?"
"2865060","2866140"," Someone just said some of VIX."
"2867000","2875510"," VIX, if it can stay above 24, 47, it'll try to make a run here. "
"2878110","2882390"," Have a bearishness setting up on the spy right now, teeing off on the, on the sixth day."
"2893070","2894610"," Let's see if we can get new low down here."
"2895170","2897390"," Tag that pre market low at 390 83. "
"2909690","2911690"," They got a little bit more to go, 390 82."
"2914850","2917730"," We have another low back here, 286 53."
"2921820","2924340"," Give it right there, 383, there's a couple of them. "
"2925200","2927080"," We'll find them in the cash market low."
"2929760","2931340"," 386 29 below there."
"2936610","2937850"," Just got pre market low. "
"2938150","2940390"," We've got 386 29 for the full move from yesterday."
"3020580","3022420"," They got a nice bearish cross right here."
"3022420","3023340"," We should continue low. "
"3023440","3024280"," We should tag 380."
"3024800","3026140"," We did the pre market low here."
"3026320","3030620"," We have two more targets down below 386 29 and 389 43. "
"3046280","3048640"," If you're not in puts, you want to buy them up here."
"3056800","3059980"," You want to buy 392 12 or 392 70."
"3074600","3079820"," I'll go over some of the news with the University of Michigan, your head inflation expectations are"

"3232780","3241980"," Yeah, they should sell into"

"3249300","3254200"," Not selling into, but you know, you put a short on apple and video."
"3254200","3255420"," Any of the high flyers."
"3257180","3259080"," For next week, you end up hedging those. "
"3261960","3264880"," Then you should already have a put back spread on on spy."
"3266020","3267220"," To hedge the market."
"3268160","3270000"," Hedge the hedge the spine next week. "
"3276200","3277780"," That tastes so good."

"4000080","4001620"," It's just weak on the hourly. "
"4005280","4006840"," Delly's looking really bullish on vert."
"4011080","4014120"," I'm going to go with the bull side on vert."
"4017680","4018900"," I think I agree with you. "
"4018900","4026960"," It just has to break out of the V formation that you said."
"4028340","4029720"," I forget what you called this."
"4030140","4032840"," I shouldn't say it, should I?"
"4037240","4039360"," We can't have that happen, can we?"
"4039960","4041500"," We have to have the breakout here. "
"4043560","4044940"," Just on vert."
"4046080","4053650"," If you want to know where the confirmation on vert is, it's above 1855."
"4055290","4057030"," You get the resumption of higher highs. "
"4059090","4062290"," I want to see this happen."
"4064210","4065050"," That happened."
"4066870","4069030"," I'm just going to clean that up for it. "
"4069170","4070270"," Clean all this up for you."
"4070270","4070530"," Hold on."
"4076410","4077170"," Remember that helps. "
"4079130","4079870"," This is vert."
"4080050","4081910"," V-I-R-T or V-I-R-T."
"4085930","4087050"," It's got work to do. "
"4087950","4092850"," What you don't want to do though is, what you don't want to see though here is like a break"
"4092850","4093870"," of 1780."
"4095850","4100029"," You don't want to see this come down and watch price and have a stop a low."
"4101130","4103430"," Stop a low 1760 1780. "
"4103649","4105050"," You want to see price just get up here."
"4105630","4110870"," The next ad is above 1820 1840 somewhere in there."
"4111810","4112210"," Unvert. "
"4113670","4114149"," Hold on."
"4114250","4115510"," I got a teacher calling me for my children."
"4143740","4144560"," Sorry about that. "
"4144660","4145899"," I've got a teacher's calling."
"4150229","4153410"," If you bought vert down here, it's rock and roll."
"4153970","4158810"," The only thing about vert that I could say here was, just make sure to do it. "
"4158830","4159270"," It stays above."
"4159390","4160290"," It's hourly at all times."
"4161950","4163250"," This is scary right here. "
"4163350","4164609"," This daily roll over here."
"4164729","4166350"," You don't want to see this big roll here."
"4166510","4169330"," That's what got vert before, right?"
"4170229","4171370"," You see it right here. "
"4172590","4175670"," There was a failure of checking that daily too."
"4176990","4179310"," You see it right here in this hourly right now."
"4182720","4184060"," You can see it right here, right?"
"4184420","4185500"," It looks like everything is fine. "
"4186359","4186580"," Confirmation."
"4188020","4191580"," Squeeze is higher and breaks right below that hourly in that daily trigger."
"4194690","4196390"," And some you have to monitor, I guess. "
"4199560","4201440"," You don't want to see that happen again up here."
"4206450","4209370"," It's weird too that vert takes the heat for."
"4213020","4215200"," You know, it reminds me of like a coin base. "
"4215580","4218140"," Well, I guess coin base is kind of in."
"4218320","4220220"," I've got some big buyers stepping in right now in the spot."
"4220940","4222560"," 12 million buyers right here. "
"4227520","4236160"," I didn't make much on puts there."
"4236160","4240240"," I made a seven cents, six cents on puts."
"4242280","4243700"," I didn't make much on puts here. "
"4245120","4246460"," I'm a little far out there."
"4246500","4247120"," I meant like 386."
"4248560","4249920"," So I didn't do too great on that trade. "
"4257570","4259190"," The fucking puts don't pay, man."
"4267270","4269630"," Big buyers down here on the one minute."
"4271370","4272150"," 11 million. "
"4286840","4288680"," Yeah, I'm watching Vix right now in the background."
"4288680","4292740"," I think the put buyers are winning."
"4292980","4295080"," I mean, we've got equity buyers in here. "
"4304270","4305810"," In the one minute on Vix here."
"4306810","4307770"," Back on Vix."
"4314730","4316810"," Should get another role up here at some point. "
"4322420","4326900"," Not sure if it happens here at the 390, 63 or 392 or five."
"4333320","4335840"," I'll look to reenter in just a minute here."
"4361370","4362870"," No news out of the market right now. "
"4363030","4363730"," Not hearing anything."
"4363890","4364510"," Squawk is on."
"4364690","4365070"," Not talking. "
"4368150","4369490"," Why is my chat pause?"
"4382900","4384580"," Yeah, the hedges are good right now, right?"
"4386500","4388860"," Anyone that's in putback spreads should be doing pretty well here."
"4397690","4399350"," The question becomes though in those head."
"4399470","4400670"," The question becomes those hedges. "
"4400730","4401550"," When do you pull them off?"
"4402270","4403930"," I usually pull them off too early."
"4404630","4408290"," I should leave them on and not pull them off."
"4408450","4408750"," But I do. "
"4408890","4410210"," I fucking sell them all the time."
"4410470","4412190"," I never leave them on for the full run."
"4413510","4414390"," I get greedy. "
"4415190","4416110"," Give me the money."
"4419250","4429670"," Yeah, I"
"4429670","4430770"," sell too early all the time."
"4435600","4436920"," I should leave. "
"4437300","4441000"," So whenever I put this, I didn't put the putback spread on yesterday because I didn't have a"
"4441000","4441700"," thousand stream."
"4442320","4444780"," It wasn't streaming I would have, but I didn't have the time to."
"4445980","4447460"," It's a moment I can get some on today. "
"4447740","4451960"," But even so, I'm looking for like 3600, 2800."
"4452560","4458020"," And I know if we trade like 37, like 3720, I'll be like, take the money and get out of"
"4458020","4458220"," here."
"4467150","4469870"," Tag that's one almost to the, almost to the pin strike. "
"4471950","4486420"," Next target below, 386.29. I"
"4486420","4487700"," do the same thing on the upside too."
"4487900","4489240"," I don't hold as long as I should."
"4490800","4491560"," I used to. "
"4491780","4492360"," I used to come out."
"4492540","4493000"," I used to trade."
"4493180","4494220"," When I wasn't streaming, I would trade. "
"4494620","4495900"," I would like grab on a trend day."
"4496060","4498560"," I grab a bunch of calls and just hold them all day long."
"4503220","4504100"," They start streaming. "
"4504300","4509400"," I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I hold into like where I think it's going and what if it turns around"
"4509400","4511380"," and people are all stinky about it."
"4511520","4512860"," So take the money."
"4513000","4513680"," Take the winnings and run. "
"4513680","4522460"," I think it has more to do with me streaming."
"4526240","4528920"," You want to like lock in profits for people, stuff like that."
"4535940","4537500"," Yeah, Chase, you're a diamond hander. "
"4537580","4538320"," I know you are."
"4539760","4541460"," I used to be more of a diamond hander."
"4541520","4542100"," Not as much anymore. "
"4545600","4546160"," I know."
"4546220","4547180"," I know Chase Diamondhands."
"4549500","4551100"," I mean, Chase with Chase. "
"4551860","4554320"," I got to give Chase a lot of respect because last year."
"4556280","4561200"," We'd see like face wrappers, like one, two, three hundred points and Chase wouldn't be phased."
"4561280","4562560"," He'd be like, fuck that shit. "
"4562960","4565340"," I'm still short and I can't wait until he hit the next bottom."
"4566380","4568200"," I'd be in stream screaming at him."
"4568380","4570580"," I'd be like, take the money and run reset. "
"4588180","4588980"," Abandon ship."
"4591720","4600760"," I don't know man, these puts are holding value in here."
"4602400","4603400"," They haven't come down. "
"4603560","4608200"," I was looking to see if these 386s would come down to like 33 cents or something and they haven't."
"4609220","4610700"," I'm gonna have to jump back in them again."
"4617380","4620500"," If I could put holders, man, they hold them till they go to zero. "
"4621260","4622780"," I'll give them some respect on that, at least."
"4627120","4630440"," Put holders like, fuck you, we're holding these to the end of the day."
"4631340","4632520"," I'm like, I'm in and I'm out. "

"4657790","4659230"," Just give them to me, keep again."
"4661950","4663510"," I'm flat right now if you're wondering."
"4673680","4679100"," Yeah, I wanna see if there's a quick squeeze here and then slam that down. "
"4682580","4683960"," Put your expense in at the moment."
"4684280","4687420"," So I'm like, eh, fucking hate buying expensive shit."
"4703310","4704770"," I took the money out over here. "
"4704830","4706310"," I didn't want to stay in this crap."
"4706310","4708030"," I want to see it squeeze higher and then come back."
"4709410","4718670"," 10.56. We got four minutes left for the bears for the half hour. "

"4909700","4911100"," The whole discord is a bear den."
"4918400","4922960"," So I guess the, I guess our bearish discord wasn't bearish enough for this guy. "
"4927700","4932660"," I think people say that to me too."
"4932660","4937180"," People are like the, people tell me they're like the fucking discord is always bearish."

"5348670","5349590"," Almost there, Winky."
"5349790","5350170"," Hang tight, bro. "
"5398230","5400730"," So, Winky, I'm still bearish on dar."
"5408060","5409780"," But with that said."
"5419360","5420180"," Hold on, brother. "
"5460480","5463500"," I am what I don't like about dar right now."
"5463640","5465480"," Winky is right here."
"5465640","5468440"," We're starting to just dip our wicks down below. "
"5470260","5471320"," Like this right here."
"5471340","5472220"," Don't want to see that happen."
"5473160","5474840"," Don't want to keep seeing this happen. "
"5476660","5477440"," Down here."
"5479660","5481920"," It's bullish on the day, but on."
"5492720","5494600"," It has broken support. "
"5500980","5505100"," How about a 45 bucks on dar."
"5505340","5507060"," Another thing about dar here too is."
"5512800","5514300"," It might take some consolidating. "
"5520110","5522110"," Not necessarily bearish on dar."
"5535680","5537200"," But I think it's going to console."
"5537380","5538960"," I think it's going to need some time down here. "
"5539160","5541460"," So, we'll look for like 45 bucks."
"5542880","5544580"," And then this kind of stuff over here, right?"
"5547620","5549100"," It's definitely worth an alert."
"5549340","5553220"," Put an alert on dar at $45, maybe $46. "
"5553220","5557440"," Just so you can be just like be ready for it."
"5560020","5560900"," Darling ingredients."
"5571340","5572460"," Not anti dar. "
"5573800","5574780"," Oh, but it's close."
"5575380","5577120"," 45, 46 bucks somewhere in there."
"5592230","5593990"," He's got another one he's sent me to. "
"5597830","5601230"," Oh, Winky's saying that he took the day off work and slept in."
"5601470","5602130"," You dirty dog."
"5602330","5603370"," I almost did that this morning. "
"5604310","5607030"," My my throat so fucked up."
"5607190","5608610"," I was like, maybe I just take Friday off."
"5609070","5609710"," But I didn't. "
"5609850","5611190"," People were like, you're coming on stream today."
"5611190","5612230"," I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll be there."
"5615910","5616970"," What else has he got?"
"5617890","5620710"," He's also talking about AMD still hitting 100. "
"5621090","5622250"," I'm not anti that either."
"5623290","5624930"," I think they just sell into it though."
"5625130","5627030"," I think it's fine for like AMD to hit 100. "
"5633780","5634280"," What's that?"
"5634440","5634760"," 98."
"5635080","5636060"," Did it actually tag 100?"
"5636240","5640220"," That 98 47 was the top on AMD."
"5642740","5646000"," 98 78 close close to 100 almost nailed it. "
"5646580","5647260"," I think they'll up there."
"5647260","5648220"," They're like going to sell into."
"5649300","5651520"," Every time we squeeze up there, they're going to sell into it. "
"5651720","5652900"," Squeeze up their cell into it."
"5661600","5663160"," 36 has come down now."
"5663280","5664400"," They're like 36 cents. "
"5684630","5687970"," Maybe I should grab some calls here for a 15 minute."
"5690810","5713080"," 4.0. Let's"
"5713080","5713180"," see."
"5726200","5728840"," Some calls right here for this trade higher. "
"5757520","5759340"," Yeah, I think we're waiting on Dar."
"5760700","5765090"," Get some calls for a trade higher."
"5765390","5767250"," We'll see if we can tag 391. "
"5788750","5791150"," They're buying the fuck out of XLF right now, aren't they?"
"5791810","5793370"," I'm looking on their daily right now."
"5793490","5796270"," They're buying all of XLF right now."
"5799250","5800130"," They're buying it. "
"5800610","5803190"," Hundreds of millions of shares of XLF being bought."
"5810400","5813880"," We had 50 million shares sold today, but last two days."
"5816000","5819780"," You know, he had like 200 or 300 million shares bought. "
"5829120","5830280"," Oh, he's texting me."
"5830460","5831360"," He's there in the background."
"5832060","5833220"," He's conversing with me. "
"5833320","5834600"," So I think he's watching right now."
"5835600","5837420"," He's just not participating in the chat."
"5843130","5844850"," How come XLF is not moving?"
"5845010","5846050"," It's something that you buy and hold. "
"5846210","5846870"," You don't look at it."
"5847830","5852170"," You just like buy a bottom and you just wait for a cycle."
"5856500","5859380"," The indexes and stocks tend to move on low volume days. "
"5859680","5860560"," We're in a OPEC's day."
"5860700","5862960"," Mopex big volumes today."
"5864140","5864920"," Of course, trading today. "
"5885450","5890250"," David G says I slept in didn't get up the kids for my wife or breakfast or anything."
"5890510","5893250"," She called me on her way to work like, oh, are you up?"
"5912830","5914110"," Oh, do we have a theater room?"
"5914250","5914590"," We should."
"5920270","5921570"," We should have a theater room. "
"5921650","5922550"," I need to, I haven't been in."
"5922610","5924810"," I've been talking to Winky and to your wife's boyfriend."
"5924990","5926210"," We're having like meetings and stuff. "
"5926830","5928710"," I'm trying to set up a trying to."
"5928850","5929550"," Oh, shit."
"5931730","5932410"," Hold on here. "
"5935210","5936510"," I'm about to take these off."
"5942360","5943280"," Close taken off."
"5943280","5944340"," I want to take them off like right here. "
"5944920","5945640"," Just in here somewhere."
"5951400","5956840"," I'm trying to set up a meeting with the dev and a couple other guys for Sunday for a finalized"
"5956840","5958160"," meeting for the discord."
"5959000","5961000"," And just a roadmap for the discord. "
"5961580","5963720"," And we should have some rooms for everyone."
"5964580","5965480"," Like, you know, theta rooms."
"5966240","5967780"," We'll have like a shit posting room. "
"5967920","5968380"," We'll have."
"5969280","5972700"," I feel like a Tesla bowl or a Tesla queue."
"5973020","5973680"," You'll have your own room. "
"5975740","5977520"," We're going to sign mods to these rooms."
"5977720","5980600"," So if you're a theta trainer, if you're a theta trainer, you're interested in modding some of these"
"5980600","5981400"," rooms or if you're."
"5981740","5989640"," If you're like a Tesla jester, somebody who's very positive on Tesla and you want a Tesla room, can"
"5989640","5990400"," you reach out to. "
"5991320","5995840"," They're myself and DM or into the discord to your wife's boyfriend or Jason Hendricks."
"5998080","5999820"," Because we're going to need mods for these rooms."
"6000280","6002040"," You're going to get a room for everything, I think. "
"6002600","6003700"," So there should be a room for it."
"6003960","6004720"," Like if you're a theta trader."
"6005740","6009140"," If you're, I don't know if I'll have a room for like box traders or anything like that, but we'll"
"6009140","6010260"," have like a room. "
"6010700","6015800"," So if you like AMC GM, GM, I think we have to create a room for bank stocks too."
"6016260","6018860"," I think there has to be, I think bank stocks are going to be the new."
"6020440","6023560"," Regional bank stocks are likely going to turn into some kind of a."
"6025000","6026280"," It's own kind of a thing. "
"6032290","6033970"," Maybe we'll create that room as well."
"6035390","6036750"," Room for bulls, room for bears."
"6043410","6045010"," Yeah, so we'll have a room for everybody. "
"6045350","6048650"," So if you're into, if you're, we're going to keep them serious too."
"6048650","6052430"," So if you're a theta trader, if you're, we don't have a futures room."
"6052450","6055430"," So if anyone's trading just futures, you guys just have your room. "
"6055430","6057390"," Anyone goes in there and fucks around you."
"6057570","6058850"," That'll be taken very seriously."
"6059070","6060290"," Everybody comes in there and fucks around. "
"6060430","6061050"," They have instant bands."
"6061410","6067940"," So unless you guys want to raid each other's rooms or whatever, trying to have fun or something"
"6067940","6068360"," like that."
"6069000","6073020"," Generally speaking that trying to have that meeting before the weekend is out. "
"6073560","6075920"," Map it all out for everybody so that you have your spaces."
"6087420","6091780"," I'm missing some of your chats right now because I don't know why, but the chat is like holding."
"6092840","6095340"," And you're like YouTube studio is not working well this morning. "
"6097180","6098620"," Yeah, I'll do a gold room for you."
"6098900","6099260"," Absolutely."
"6099860","6100560"," Bitcoin room. "
"6100740","6102400"," So if you have a crypto room, you'll have gold."
"6104600","6106800"," And it's gold and silver probably same room."
"6114980","6117480"," Yeah, exactly like a wall FRC. "
"6118720","6120960"," I'm assuming that people want to trade the bank stocks."
"6121240","6125340"," I'm assuming that there's a whole class of people too that are upside down in those stocks, right?"
"6126060","6127200"," So they're going to be interested."
"6143860","6145880"," You know, we've got some big futures traders here. "
"6146080","6150120"," So I'd like to really get like John Hagerty maybe running that futures room."
"6150760","6154460"," I've got a friend in discord outside of our discord."
"6154740","6157180"," I got to ask him to close friend. "
"6157360","6160120"," That's a globe X trader."
"6160300","6162560"," I think he's he's out of Europe somewhere."
"6162980","6167440"," I haven't talked to him about a year or two, but I used to be when I wasn't streaming. "
"6168340","6169460"," I'd meet up with him in the morning."
"6170060","6174940"," And we would chat and he'd be closing our positions and every opening positions for the day."
"6175040","6177620"," And we'd just have a have a quick talk every morning. "
"6177940","6179760"," I always respect him as a great futures trader."
"6180840","6184320"," I can always reach out to him and see if he'll help us out in there."
"6184900","6185540"," Give him a space. "
"6199000","6200520"," Yeah, I like trading spreads too."
"6200640","6204100"," I mean, I'm a spread trader now, but much longer timeframes."
"6204400","6205700"," One, three months, that kind of stuff. "
"6208740","6210340"," Here's to call me a swing trader, I guess."
"6210340","6214820"," To some extent, that's why I make most of my money is in swings, not on day trading."
"6216800","6222680"," I like the money that pays the bills, like keep the electric gas on and pay all the taxes and"
"6222680","6223740"," all that other shit. "
"6224760","6224960"," We can."
"6226440","6227380"," Tattoo taxes this year."
"6228440","6229180"," Oh, man. "
"6242310","6243710"," All these local governments."
"6243970","6245250"," They're all like getting their fingers in."
"6245370","6246770"," Everybody wants their fingers right now. "
"6247290","6249930"," County governments, city governments, federal government."
"6250150","6250810"," Everybody wants their money."
"6251810","6252470"," This year. "
"6261920","6263940"," Joe Matello is a great swing trader too."
"6264560","6267420"," Joe Matello would be great futures trader inside that room."
"6267460","6268180"," I think she trades futures. "
"6279300","6280840"," Yeah, precious metals room, right?"
"6281300","6282000"," I agree with that one."
"6283800","6287380"," Yeah, I think we saw we have a meme stock room, but I think we need two of them."
"6287420","6291140"," I think we need like the one for meme stocks, and then we need the one for bank stocks. "
"6291460","6292560"," Like two separate rooms."
"6294620","6297160"," Oh, look at trying to sell sell us off right now."
"6297460","6298640"," I'm still long calls right here. "
"6300060","6301260"," I got caught in this right here."
"6301320","6301620"," Just now."
"6302380","6303520"," I just got caught in this. "
"6314560","6316100"," I'm going to have to take the other side of this trade."
"6316260","6317060"," I think here in just a minute."
"6320850","6323770"," Three eighty sixes are now back down to thirty three cents to which is not. "
"6323910","6325530"," That's what I jumped in was that thirty three cents."
"6329590","6335940"," I'm going to have to be."
"6335940","6337120"," I'm going to have to have a strangle here. "
"6345310","6348410"," No, I'm long and short or long long puts long calls."
"6352640","6356440"," We got three eighty six P's and I'm still sitting on three ninety twos."
"6361760","6365520"," So whatever side prints, I'm assuming it'll print both side or one side. "
"6374410","6376050"," I'm going to pull this bullshit here."
"6376230","6378390"," I'm going to pull this bullshit with trying all these bullshit traps."
"6381880","6383360"," I'll just take both sides of the trade. "
"6391140","6394200"," Well, no, the rooms aren't like the way that you think they are."
"6394360","6396260"," So someone just made a good comment."
"6396420","6397420"," They said less rooms, please. "
"6397780","6400360"," So the idea behind the rooms is going to be."
"6401840","6402980"," You'll have a main room."
"6403240","6406580"," So let me give you the idea of what's going on here in the more complete picture. "
"6408940","6413380"," So the idea here is I've paid for in the past."
"6413380","6414640"," I've been a part of discord."
"6416020","6420600"," They pay for like four, five, six hundred bucks, thousand bucks a month. "
"6420720","6421160"," That kind of stuff."
"6421940","6423320"," The ones that I've longed to."
"6424680","6425620"," You sign up. "
"6425920","6430660"," You're forced to watch a video or read a bunch of rules and stuff like that."
"6430660","6431820"," You like enter into a room."
"6431920","6434700"," You read a bunch of shit and you agree and sign off to it. "
"6434780","6435860"," They check your email address."
"6436040","6436880"," They check your phone number."
"6438060","6440000"," Then you gain access to a main room. "
"6441180","6443300"," So let me really talk to you guys about this."
"6443420","6445060"," Maybe you guys have better insight than I do."
"6445520","6449200"," If there's anything you can comment here, maybe in the chat and I'll read it and see. "
"6449380","6450220"," I'll write it down actually."
"6450860","6455840"," If you agree or disagree or have some kind of input that you want to put or give us."
"6456600","6458200"," Because we've been talking about this in the background. "
"6460720","6463640"," Let me get a pen and paper out here and write some of your comments down."
"6472790","6474490"," Let me get a second here."
"6478480","6481660"," Well, the put side is helping me right now. "
"6482580","6484220"," Paying for my call side right now."
"6484260","6485320"," The damage on my call side."
"6486280","6489300"," I'm up almost a hundred percent on puts right now. "
"6490200","6492380"," Not a hundred percent, but fairly good."
"6492620","6494220"," Just seeing a piece by voice is here."
"6494340","6499640"," They say Norway's Equinor will join the European Union's Joint Scheme for gas procurements or as a"
"6499640","6499920"," supplier. "
"6499920","6505940"," But the aim of signing more long-term contracts, European Commission, President Ursula von de Leyen"
"6505940","6506520"," said on Friday."
"6506960","6507620"," No, no, no."
"6515280","6518380"," So we have to out the piece by voice is on the news here for those of you that are"
"6518380","6518660"," interested. "
"6523500","6526020"," I'm wondering if I could cut the call side and just stay in the puts."
"6530240","6531800"," So the idea here is this."
"6532040","6535120"," You come into when we launch the website, right?"
"6536020","6539420"," You'll have to go back through the website to get it back into the discord as a group. "
"6539780","6541520"," Just for one day for like an hour or so."
"6542360","6543720"," So you re-enter the discord."
"6544140","6545860"," There'll be a room that's going to tell you all the rules. "
"6546100","6547360"," You have to read them or watch them."
"6547460","6548960"," You have to watch a video for myself."
"6550120","6551740"," But that talks about the rules. "
"6552380","6553580"," Sign off on it and agree to them."
"6554460","6558180"," You then be and you then enter a main room in the discord."
"6559660","6563280"," Inside this main room is kind of like your daily chat, right?"
"6563280","6564460"," You have like a daily chat room. "
"6565540","6569880"," We're going to have moderators that are leading the conversation in that room."
"6570880","6575320"," Trusted moderators, trusted admins, I guess trusted traders."
"6575880","6578760"," So if we already have them in mind, some of them in mind, not everybody. "
"6579060","6579940"," We have a few of them in mind."
"6580580","6585420"," So that trusted moderator will set a conversation for the day in that room."
"6585840","6587960"," If that conversation changes into something else. "
"6589220","6592460"," So be it, but there'll be a main like, hey, this is the market for today."
"6592860","6594100"," This is where we think the market is going."
"6595480","6597060"," And now that will lead the discussion. "
"6598120","6600140"," And then we'll have members, right?"
"6600260","6604840"," If you're a member of the discord, you'll be able to speak inside the discord."
"6605100","6606880"," Talk about that topic in that main room."
"6607880","6610420"," Or against or other ideas, that kind of stuff. "
"6610960","6611880"," So you come into this main room."
"6612000","6613760"," That's the main discussion is on the market."

"6628780","6632780"," If you're like, so right now you should be trying to get in the discord because new people that"
"6632780","6638660"," enter the discord at some point will only be allowed to won't be allowed to speak for a few days,"
"6638660","6641980"," like three to five days, calling off period for you to get to know the discord. "
"6641980","6646840"," You'll have some kind of a moderator that you can speak with in contact."
"6646900","6651920"," If you have questions, you'll be kind of walked around and mentored for the first three to five"

"6665060","6670260"," And hopefully we can track if you're making calls like, hey, I'm long this or I'm short that we're"
"6670260","6673140"," going to try to track how good your record is."
"6673920","6676300"," So you can be trusted or not inside the discord. "
"6676760","6681100"," You're not just constantly posting things like, hey, I'm short, hey, I'm short, or hey, I'm long,"
"6681340","6681700"," hey, I'm long."
"6683320","6687160"," So we know where you stand and you're trading and you're trading a journey."
"6689040","6692360"," Now, let's say you come to the main room and you're like, hey, I don't like trading the spy or"
"6692360","6693840"," only trading SPX or ES. "
"6694980","6697540"," I really want to trade Tesla or something like that."
"6697760","6701940"," You can request or even just when you're signing up, say, I want to sign up for this room, this"
"6701940","6702620"," room and this room."
"6703340","6705320"," And then I'll give you some kind of access to other rooms. "
"6705960","6710920"," There'll be some other rooms with tools in them or access to tools from the website."
"6711940","6715540"," For you to gain access to those tools, you're going to have to pay for the website."
"6717280","6718480"," That kind of stuff, right?"
"6718680","6721200"," So if you're like, hey, I want this access to this tool inside the discord. "
"6721200","6724340"," It's going to be in its own separate room for you to go in there and check on those tools."
"6725700","6730360"," Any of the free tools and stuff will be, they'll be access to those in the main discord."
"6735080","6736900"," But some people want places for that stuff. "
"6737620","6739760"," I'm in a chat right now for Tesla bulls."
"6740720","6745260"," And whenever Tesla's going really good or really bad, people want to jump into that chat and"
"6745260","6747280"," discuss if it's good."
"6747640","6750560"," So those rooms should be available, although they won't be the main room. "
"6770800","6772560"," Boy, it was how I professionally lose money."
"6773060","6777100"," Yeah, I used to be a big gas trader, not anymore."
"6777380","6779420"," Here and there, I buy a gas and like a lot of those and shit. "
"6780480","6783640"," But like, you know, I'll try to piss away some water tickets on that."
"6788460","6790140"," I'm on both sides of the trade right now."
"6790380","6791760"," I'm on calls and puts right here. "
"6792380","6793380"," I haven't closed either side."
"6804600","6806000"," I have no interest, right?"
"6806000","6807840"," It's like this at this market right here."
"6807960","6809300"," I have no interest in it. "
"6809440","6814560"," So the only way for me to even content or attempt to make any money here is a big wild"
"6814560","6816180"," swing higher or a big wild swing lower."
"6817000","6820620"," But all this like bullshit in here, this like quick little roll over right here."
"6821040","6823900"," So I was long calls right here, bought some calls right here. "
"6824560","6827800"," And I wanted to see the tag of the five minute and they threw it down early."
"6828060","6831800"," So I'm like, oh fuck this, grab some puts started printing down here."
"6832540","6835460"," Now they're back to I'm up a penny right now and puts. "
"6835460","6837780"," So I need a swing."
"6838000","6840940"," I need like a big swing higher or a big swing lower to make some money."
"6866280","6867480"," Yeah, I'm holding both sides. "
"6867480","6868300"," I'm not going to cut them loose."
"6878840","6882400"," What's funny is my call side is back almost to the original money."
"6884760","6891480"," So right now I've got like, oh hold on here. "
"6891560","6893640"," I'm losing some power here in the background."
"6897680","6898900"," Which side more favorable?"
"6899620","6900260"," Can't say."
"6900760","6901380"," Can't call it. "
"6912240","6915920"," The day looks to me like they're trying to print everything today, right?"
"6916160","6917680"," Trying to print those opal calls."
"6918300","6920760"," Like this looks like big banks just printing all their shit."
"6926890","6928470"," In positioning for next week. "
"6929070","6931610"," So for day trading, I don't know what to say to you."
"6936210","6938490"," Now you guys, we're in mopex."
"6938790","6939830"," You guys all understand that?"
"6940110","6941110"," Today is mopex. "
"6941390","6942450"," We're in monthly opex."
"6942770","6943430"," We're in the witching."
"6945470","6952210"," So you've got large players that want their positions to close out where they want the market to"
"6952210","6952310"," be. "
"6952370","6954010"," These are the people that own the stock market."
"6956210","6958750"," Am I a leading bearish on the market for next week?"
"6959670","6965350"," Yesterday inside stream, I told you put on a putback spread and trade the market up if it goes up."
"6965730","6967010"," That's my positioning on the market. "
"6984340","6985980"," Yeah, strangles are fine on the market."
"6986500","6991880"," The whole idea behind this is if you're above the five minute, so if you're above the whole trade,"
"6992080","6992620"," here's the trade."
"6995920","6997900"," So this is a five minute chart right here, okay?"
"6998300","6999120"," This is the trade. "
"7000260","7003080"," So as long as we trade underneath this white line, we're bearish."
"7003280","7003660"," Does it make sense?"
"7004540","7006180"," They're trying to sell off that right now."
"7006900","7007540"," Does it make sense?"
"7008920","7014180"," Now if we get a squeeze here, I want to have some exposure to it, right?"
"7016100","7020660"," So I'm going to want to have some exposure to the downside risk, and then I want some exposure to"
"7020660","7022240"," a squeeze higher, the traps bears. "
"7023680","7027140"," Either one of these trades, as long as we don't trade sideways, should print."
"7031450","7032130"," Does that make sense?"
"7032570","7033790"," I don't know if it does or doesn't for you."
"7037090","7038390"," So I'm going to show it to you right here. "
"7038390","7040290"," So let's say we're trading up high here."
"7041070","7043210"," You can do this by owning the stock market too."
"7043210","7044450"," You don't have to do this with zero dates. "
"7044570","7045790"," You can do this weekly, either."
"7046530","7048750"," So let's say we're coming down here, right?"
"7049650","7053450"," And we trade higher and hold this, and you enter calls long here."
"7054110","7057090"," And let's say you get trapped and they throw you right underneath on you, right?"
"7057230","7063170"," You would take the short side of the trade, hold on to the long side still, and you would take"
"7063170","7067470"," the short side of the trade down, right, and try to get a print off it. "
"7067470","7069450"," That pays for this up here."
"7069530","7070270"," This bull shit up here."
"7070530","7071270"," Does that make sense?"
"7072850","7073930"," Same thing down here. "
"7080160","7081580"," There's a white paper on this stuff."
"7081720","7082520"," Let me see if I can find it."
"7085580","7087820"," We've got our own white paper for it too, so. "
"7089400","7091320"," You'll actually get access to it at some point."
"7092480","7096400"," When the website launches, you'll get access to a white paper that explains trading bull sides."
"7107800","7108460"," Oh, no. "
"7108960","7110700"," I don't see too much."
"7111040","7115200"," I see it on zero dates, but not at this time of the morning."
"7115680","7119440"," Like 1.30 in the afternoon, you take a big hit, 2.30 in the afternoon, take a big hit"
"7119440","7121040"," as a closer to four o'clock. "
"7124450","7125570"," Right here, we should get a move."
"7125870","7129530"," If we start doing that bull shit, though, if we start doing this nonsense all day long, we do this"
"7129530","7132030"," nonsense, I will cut bull sides loose and take the L."
"7139980","7141420"," I agree later in the day, yes."
"7142180","7145920"," That candle starts fucking turning into a fucking Roman candle, doesn't it?"
"7158830","7159670"," Whitching hour. "
"7159870","7161010"," We're super natural events appear."
"7166140","7169740"," Currently, I've got it set to currently on."
"7170020","7171400"," So these aren't moving averages. "
"7171620","7173040"," They got to change them every day."
"7174780","7182700"," But currently, I'm using a six, a six length, and then I'm using a 27 length."
"7182700","7184060"," And then a 1.29 length. "
"7186620","7191000"," And I'm using them on a one minute chart, a five minute chart, an hourly chart, and daily chart."
"7205930","7208270"," Yeah, so this is pretty smart, too."
"7208390","7211170"," So Squillium is saying don't trade after 2.30 on the whitching. "
"7211930","7213350"," He's making a very fair point."
"7213570","7221110"," A lot of stocks that are down into the whitching will sometimes ramp and a lot of stocks that are"
"7221110","7225490"," up into the 2.30 hour will start fucking blasting down."
"7226110","7227170"," A very good point. "
"7227430","7228110"," Thanks for saying that."
"7229370","7229770"," Squillium."
"7253440","7256760"," Yeah, Alexander's saying St. Patrick's Day at a Friday equals amateur night. "
"7257040","7258600"," There's like, you have no biz."
"7258700","7259520"," I want to warn you that too."
"7259660","7260280"," Thanks for saying that. "
"7260540","7261880"," We get some great comments this morning."
"7262440","7267800"," We've got Alexander Kobach is saying St. Patrick's Day on a Friday night equals amateur night."
"7268200","7270220"," And that leads into like two things. "
"7271100","7274980"," Number one, every asshole in the world is going to be out drinking tonight."
"7275640","7277820"," These are people that you don't want to even interact with."
"7278820","7283920"," Number two, every cop is going to be out tonight and tomorrow morning on Saturday. "
"7285240","7288760"," So don't get caught out there like drinking and driving on an amateur night."
"7289200","7292980"," Don't get caught out there fighting somebody to bar on a Friday night."
"7293860","7298780"," And then I would if you're if you're drinking and not driving tonight, I would not be out driving"
"7298780","7299620"," in the morning either. "
"7299740","7305360"," I used to know a police officer that told me that he got most of his DUI's in the morning"
"7305360","7308180"," after like New Year's St. Patrick's Day."
"7309380","7311700"," Like they're not looking for you the night before they're looking for it."
"7311720","7313300"," When you think you're sober, you're like, yeah, I'm sober. "
"7314020","7316580"," I stopped drinking last night at the bar at a St. Patty's Day."
"7316680","7317080"," I took an Uber."
"7317560","7319200"," I'm going to hop my car down and get some groceries. "
"7320140","7321300"," And they're just waiting for you."
"7321860","7326560"," So don't be, you're going to like drink tonight and hang out like try to do it at home and"
"7326560","7329520"," try not to drive tomorrow unless you're absolutely sure you're sober."
"7331460","7332820"," That's a very good point. "
"7333980","7336980"," Professional drinkers know not to drink on St. Patrick's Day."
"7338360","7340580"," Not that you should ever be drinking and driving ever."
"7340820","7341500"," I should state that. "
"7342320","7345180"," But if you are going to like sometimes people think that they're sober."
"7346160","7346960"," They're like, I'm fine."
"7347680","7348860"," Like the next day. "
"7349580","7351040"," And you're not to drive."
"7358750","7359710"," Professional drinkers."
"7362210","7366890"," This is when like young, stupid people drink and drive and fight. "
"7373690","7380290"," Yeah, your wife's boyfriend and I, we did our drinking yesterday in the day time."
"7380530","7380990"," We did drink."
"7381210","7384810"," Well, I didn't day drink, but we drank at like five, six o'clock last night together. "
"7385010","7386210"," Had a few shots together."
"7386930","7391190"," We did it early."
"7391190","7395470"," The young crowd of crazy people over the weekend. "
"7401660","7403900"," Nick asked us saying St. Patty's Day sucks."
"7404200","7405700"," They all want to be Italians anyways."
"7409080","7410280"," That's a fair point too. "
"7410840","7412780"," Kyle is saying drink water before bed."
"7412980","7413660"," I agree with that statement."
"7416460","7418660"," Oh, I grabbed her showing some shamrocks, baby. "
"7419640","7420580"," Good luck out there all."
"7421000","7423580"," I'm off for a little bit."
"7424340","7425040"," I'll see you later. "
"7425740","7427080"," I'll see you at the end of the day."
"7427160","7428160"," Yeah, I agree with that, Grubster."
"7429080","7430820"," Day not to trade today for sure. "
"7450830","7456390"," Oh, it's an economist saying what apologize kept you say that they are not are or are not under"
"7456390","7456910"," moving averages."
"7457310","7458770"," We are on the five minute chart."
"7458990","7460590"," We're under this is a five minute chart right here. "
"7460590","7464630"," So as long as we're up prices underneath this this line right here."
"7465250","7466130"," We're bearish."
"7466290","7466930"," Just so you know. "
"7467570","7471950"," So we're bearish as long as we stand underneath this line, but there are traps today, right?"
"7471950","7472810"," It's mopex, right?"
"7472970","7473850"," So there are traps everywhere."
"7477310","7479010"," So you might be bearish here."
"7479830","7481490"," Maybe like, yeah, we're underneath the five minute. "
"7481590","7484290"," We're maybe bearish, but then five minutes later, we're straight up here."
"7490410","7492610"," Like normal trading rules don't apply today."
"7493510","7498970"," These are large banks institutions that positionally want the market where they want it. "
"7507980","7509720"," You forgot it was say Patrick's Day."
"7512100","7515880"," So like under normal circumstances right where we are right here looks super bearish to me and I'm"
"7515880","7517860"," like, yeah, we could squeeze up right here at any moment."
"7519820","7529760"," Like, yeah, your wife is"
"7529760","7531640"," a bartender and ours bar and by that bar. "
"7531820","7536520"," Yeah, I grew up in in Boston, my part of my family is from Southie."
"7538140","7540040"," And this is a pretty big day for them."
"7541180","7542820"," Or it was for a long time when I was young. "
"7549300","7550900"," That's the only way to own a bar, right?"
"7550900","7552120"," Owning it, but not running it."
"7559570","7564110"," Hutch is saying I got some cold ones to watch basketball was all amped up and I drank three and"
"7564110","7566250"," fell asleep in my couch for two hours."
"7566390","7574970"," I talked to my youngest daughter last night about maybe doing a through hike on one of the long"
"7574970","7575370"," trails. "
"7581660","7583640"," That's what our conversation was last night."
"7584880","7586400"," I didn't fall asleep last night."
"7586580","7587840"," I spent time with my youngest. "
"7590630","7593190"," We were discussing maybe taking not right now."
"7593230","7598870"," She's a little young for it, but taking a spring and summer off and hiking one of them."
"7599050","7601270"," I can't decide which one I'd like to hike with her. "
"7602890","7605630"," I can't I was thinking maybe the CDT, but."
"7606930","7613210"," I like the idea of like the PCT is more like a mix of the AT and the CDT."
"7613250","7614010"," So you kind of get both. "
"7614810","7621490"," You're not as it's not as away from civilization is this place is to stop for civilization."
"7623810","7625470"," It's like an happy medium."
"7633670","7635530"," Yeah, CDT is beautiful though. "
"7635930","7637330"," It's absolutely gorgeous."
"7638130","7639670"," I've liked harsh portions of it."
"7639730","7640350"," It's amazing. "
"7660540","7670360"," I'd like to know what the if we have more like PWI crashes on the day"
"7670360","7675480"," after these days, like we have a higher rate of accidents and deaths the day after like a St."
"7675720","7676480"," Patrick's like is it?"
"7676540","7680440"," Do you have more crashes on St. like on New New Year's day rather than New Year's Eve?"
"7681520","7685080"," People like feel like that they're sober and then they're driving around town."
"7685440","7686740"," All all trashed."
"7693310","7697030"," Yes, I've liked the northern portions of the. "
"7698790","7701190"," AT most of the AT in the northern portions."
"7703190","7712840"," So I like I like the idea of the AT"
"7712840","7713760"," for her because."
"7714680","7716140"," There's a ton of people on it. "
"7716360","7718240"," You're talking about they have events and stuff."
"7718260","7720880"," They have like meetups and these towns."
"7721320","7723580"," If you do it in season towns have parties and stuff. "
"7723960","7726860"," I mean a lot of kids there that kind of stuff."
"7727180","7728700"," It's way developed, right?"
"7728960","7730600"," It's not not near what it once was."
"7733740","7737020"," But then there's parts of the AT that I don't look forward to at all. "

"7844240","7845960"," Yeah, I don't think a lot of people are trading today."
"7846040","7846900"," Jill's saying that too."
"7849380","7852720"," I don't think I don't think there are a lot of traders today out there in the market. "
"7852880","7853040"," Maybe."
"7853040","7855800"," I mean, look right here."
"7855880","7857160"," I mean, let's look right here. "

"7899260","7900800"," Tesla's turning into child support. "

"8161100","8163240"," People were going crazy about it."
"8166710","8168170"," Yeah, it was millennial money, right?"
"8168370","8168930"," That's what it was called."
"8169890","8172510"," I was able to stop in and see that channel before it was deleted. "
"8173530","8174770"," Like just before they deleted it."
"8179720","8180860"," He was named in a lawsuit."
"8180940","8182280"," Was it SCC or FINRA?"
"8182460","8183440"," Or was it just like a."
"8187610","8188990"," Like somebody sued him or something. "
"8194580","8196700"," I'm assuming it's over that channel that he had."
"8199520","8202900"," Someone told me that he was like, they were like, I think I think I deleted the videos."
"8203200","8206080"," Then he deleted, I don't know if the channel is still up or not, but they were like, hey, they"
"8206080","8206959"," might delete the channel too. "
"8206959","8207860"," So I went and checked it out."
"8208860","8210480"," All the videos are private."
"8211820","8212559"," Allegedly, I don't know. "
"8212559","8213719"," I don't know if they're private or."
"8216299","8218860"," I haven't checked out to see if the channel still exists or not."
"8230030","8231250"," Never showing FTX. "
"8231530","8232930"," I get phone calls or not phone calls."
"8233010","8238629"," I get emails often from companies who want me to like advertise."
"8241209","8242309"," Crypto and NFTs. "
"8244870","8246350"," And all that kind of stuff."
"8247450","8248730"," I haven't responded to any of them."
"8248730","8251270"," I think I responded to one that I thought was a scam. "
"8252049","8253570"," And I just wanted to play the scam."
"8253870","8255629"," Bader game, like bait some scammers."
"8258049","8260850"," But I often get emails to run that stuff. "
"8262150","8262910"," To you guys."
"8264270","8268010"," Another conversation we had last night as I was talking to your wife's boyfriend."
"8268629","8271290"," And he said it might be cool to do a get together. "
"8273770","8275270"," So like some kind of a."
"8277209","8280570"," Maybe plan a get together for next year or something."
"8282790","8286290"," So if anyone be interested in meeting up at some point in the future."
"8286969","8291110"," We could do some kind of a meet up when we expect the market to be slow or closed. "
"8294059","8296059"," On a weekend or something two or three days."
"8297280","8297920"," Nothing crazy."
"8298420","8299000"," Just like a meet up. "
"8299379","8301400"," Maybe we could have a class or two taught."
"8303900","8304639"," Nothing intense."
"8304639","8306620"," Nothing like, Hey, we're going to a conference. "
"8308400","8310080"," Just seeing from the bottom like something."
"8310620","8315480"," Court issues and arrest warrant for Russia's Putin and other Kremlin officials."
"8318680","8322290"," He was talking to your wife's boyfriend. "
"8322969","8328110"," Yeah, he was saying we should do a meet up in the next year or so."
"8328370","8328969"," Plan something."
"8330010","8331629"," I was thinking of asking Chaz about it. "
"8332450","8333370"," Hey, Chaz."
"8333370","8336110"," He's got some background and that kind of stuff."
"8336370","8336510"," So. "
"8338510","8339610"," I haven't asked yet."
"8339610","8342090"," I was going to ask you guys the community and see if you guys will be interested."
"8342389","8343230"," It doesn't have to be a large group. "
"8345530","8349150"," I wouldn't cost anything rather than, you know, you get to get yourself there."
"8349150","8353549"," And then maybe we can find a hotel or something that'll give us a discount or something, but."
"8358020","8359440"," Sandals only no close shoes. "
"8362700","8363879"," Hobbit feet symposium."
"8363879","8364420"," I like it."
"8364860","8365660"," So that would be great. "
"8365840","8366059"," Wouldn't it?"
"8367379","8369559"," Do everybody love lanyards with Hobbit feet pics."
"8372959","8374480"," But the young Jim bros meet up."
"8382760","8383660"," That'd be great. "
"8383680","8384500"," I think it'd be a great trip."
"8393350","8394410"," Cap at Twitch con."
"8394590","8395990"," Yeah, I'd have to be a partner, I think. "
"8396410","8400870"," I think is that I don't know a lot about Twitch, but I saw one brief thing about it."
"8402810","8403650"," About Twitch com."
"8403790","8404650"," I think I have to be a partner. "
"8405110","8409130"," I'm not positive, but I think I would have to be a partner."
"8409950","8411410"," I don't know if I want to become a partner."
"8412290","8417690"," I watched a video on YouTube where someone said it's not as good to be a partner. "
"8417830","8418710"," It's better to be an affiliate."
"8419350","8420450"," Anyone want to weigh in on that?"
"8421110","8423190"," I think it's better to be a partner and affiliate on Twitch."
"8424650","8426470"," And there's a lot more rules as a partner. "
"8426970","8430110"," Matter of fact, if I become a partner on Twitch, I can't multi stream."
"8431630","8435310"," Wouldn't be able to multi stream and I wouldn't be able to give content to."
"8435430","8437750"," I think there's like a make a video on Twitch. "
"8438010","8441230"," I can't put it on YouTube for a few days or something, three days or a week."
"8442130","8442990"," Something like that."
"8443130","8444110"," I don't know the rules. "
"8444390","8446010"," So don't, don't pin me down on that."
"8446150","8454370"," But yeah, does North Dakota have"
"8454370","8458950"," gambling gambling?"
"8459870","8461370"," One of those states does, right?"
"8461570","8463430"," Does Wyoming have one of these states has gambling?"
"8465390","8466710"," I have a look and see where there's gambling."
"8467450","8474610"," Maybe you could do some like hiking, biking, some, some, uh, weight water rafting maybe and some"
"8474610","8474850"," gambling. "
"8484000","8487220"," Arizona's got some nice hiking and it's cheap down there."
"8492180","8493720"," Yeah, keep control of the streams."
"8494340","8495120"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"8497420","8498980"," I've heard differing opinions."
"8503840","8506440"," Yeah, it's got mountain, uh, water raft of a no gambling."
"8507960","8508800"," Montana's sketchy casinos. "
"8509140","8509660"," I think they do."
"8509980","8513560"," I thought Montana, I was like Montana, I know it's got casinos, but they're kind of sketchy."
"8521550","8523410"," Yeah, Tahoe kind of hits it, doesn't it?"
"8524510","8525070"," Sounds good. "
"8525210","8525790"," Sounds fun, right?"
"8526010","8532190"," Like water rafting, uh, mountain biking, gambling, warm weather."
"8532490","8533810"," So it's not really like wintery weather."
"8534150","8535410"," Some people don't like the winter weather. "
"8538890","8539670"," Yeah, I've been to Toronto."
"8540490","8541990"," I got some close friends from Toronto."
"8543010","8548830"," I, uh, go to like, uh, Burning Man and I go to, um, Coachella with some people from Toronto. "
"8555820","8558100"," Yeah, Truckee would be badass, wouldn't it, Tahoe?"
"8565970","8568590"," Uh, no, I saw your question, uh, regenerator."
"8568770","8569830"," I'm trying to make my way through the list."
"8571210","8572870"," Uh, you're looking into torch lake. "
"8573570","8574530"," Are there any good neighborhoods nearby?"
"8574870","8575810"," I don't live in torch lake."
"8575810","8578570"," Uh, so I can't give a comment on it."
"8578890","8580050"," I only visit torch lake. "
"8587840","8597030"," Uh, thoughts on June calls, I think."
"8597250","8599030"," So, uh, I went through this earlier in the week."
"8599030","8600350"," We'll go over right now if you want. "
"8600650","8604950"," So, uh, we'll just come right back to SPX."
"8606230","8607670"," So we'll make it really simple."
"8609430","8611030"," But I guess people want to know, right?"
"8611350","8613190"," So we'll look at an SPX. "
"8613190","8615490"," So the idea and plan here would be."
"8618840","8621580"," Or the idea and plan here is."
"8623420","8625240"," Or it's two fold one. "
"8626080","8629780"," Uh, making large decisions on this market before."
"8631200","8634080"," FMC is probably not the best thing to do."
"8637960","8639340"," We're at high risk. "
"8640920","8642400"," Into this FMC."
"8642820","8644020"," So we're in a trough right now."
"8644020","8644540"," Do you see the trough?"
"8647060","8648460"," This is a trough right here. "
"8650640","8652480"," Historically, when we're inside this trough."
"8654560","8656960"," We have a moment of capitulation in the market."
"8659380","8659820"," Historically. "
"8661000","8662340"," So you know this, right?"
"8662680","8665020"," So now you know that we're in a trough, we're in a trading trough."
"8667300","8670420"," We usually have, if we're going to go up, we usually, we usually have."
"8672700","8673720"," A capitulation moment. "
"8674460","8676720"," Now some people claim that this was it back here."
"8678660","8679780"," I disagree with that."
"8679900","8683660"," I think that for me personally, I think we still have a capitulation moment ahead of us. "
"8684660","8685520"," In this market."
"8685700","8690540"," Now with that said, we're coming into a moment in the market in the FMC meeting where we may get"
"8690540","8690780"," that."
"8694320","8698620"," Now there's people out there saying we're going to have no landing that there is no capitulation"
"8698620","8699020"," moment. "
"8699100","8700120"," We're just going to keep trading it up."
"8700960","8702560"," I can understand that."
"8703260","8704640"," Maybe get some June calls. "
"8705600","8707900"," Try to tag that for 20 or 430 above."
"8708800","8711260"," But if you're going to do that, there's two things to consider."
"8711700","8714920"," One, the risk that we have to the downside move. "
"8716300","8719380"," And following actual price action."
"8721040","8722520"," So for myself."
"8723980","8729580"," What I'm looking for is a put back spread ratio spread. "
"8730120","8732880"," What that does is it's a free market hedge."
"8734220","8737340"," The only time that trade doesn't work is if we trade sideways."
"8738220","8740260"," So if we end up trading just like in here. "
"8741000","8742740"," Into June or September."
"8743560","8744600"," No move higher or lower."
"8745860","8746720"," They wouldn't print. "
"8749120","8750960"," But if we get a capitulation, it'll print."
"8751820","8752900"," It'll pay for itself."
"8753100","8755580"," We make the move higher and I can trade this market up into June. "
"8757300","8765040"," So with that being said, the best thing to be doing here in CFOMC is either sitting on your hands."
"8766160","8766790"," Be hedged."
"8768500","8770780"," Or wait for confirmation for the move higher. "
"8771700","8774260"," So just looking at SPX here."
"8774360","8777880"," This is a daily chart daily chart on SPX."
"8783360","8785700"," And you see this white line right here, right?"
"8785700","8789060"," I wanted to see this white line right here. "
"8791040","8794940"," So like you're kind of like, I'm being asked, well, should I buy this right here cap?"
"8795860","8798020"," And you're like, it's not really a question."
"8798360","8802140"," It's like a question like, it's a question that's like, oh, do you want me to put some risk on"
"8802140","8802300"," here?"
"8802640","8807860"," When in reality, if you're just shown the way here, you could have taken calls right here free with"
"8807860","8810280"," no space being rented in your head."
"8810800","8811420"," Does that make sense?"
"8811760","8815240"," So like this part of the trade here is called the money part of that trade, right?"
"8815800","8817100"," It's that kind of free money. "
"8817340","8823280"," It kind of being shown that we're bullish trading above the daily."
"8824700","8829740"," And you're in some kind of safety like, hey, I'm going to put on a call spread and eventually it's"
"8829740","8830100"," going to print."
"8830940","8832180"," The implication is that, right?"
"8833960","8839680"," So the idea is that if you're bullish here, you're like, I'm so bullish here. "
"8840400","8842640"," Can't really take this trade long here."
"8844420","8846280"," Without some kind of a hedging."
"8847360","8852040"," Until price breaks above this white line. "
"8852280","8857380"," Once you're above this white line with a retest, a successful retest, it becomes a safer trade."
"8857780","8858220"," Does that make sense?"
"8859400","8862960"," Like some trade above here comes back down, slams in."
"8865740","8867980"," This is where the money is in that long trade. "
"8868320","8872200"," It's where the safety ish, safe, safer part of the trade is."
"8872200","8875460"," Or this is kind of like a guessing game right here."
"8879380","8881460"," Maybe I'll put size in the market, that kind of stuff. "
"8883240","8890140"," It's a there's risk down here."
"8901030","8901810"," That's not true."
"8903650","8905390"," Velocity actually looks very bearish here. "
"8909010","8910670"," Let me see if they can bring it up for you."
"8920030","8925870"," So, like, I don't know what I'm saying here, so that's depends on the timeframe that you actually"
"8925870","8926470"," clarify."
"8930160","8931940"," Depending on the timeframe you're looking at. "
"8934580","8936420"," We look extremely bearish here."
"8946340","8948140"," I'm going to show you why that is right now."
"8960460","8961800"," I'm not extremely bearish. "
"8961800","8962700"," I should be more specific."
"8977280","8978440"," So I want to show you this."
"8979820","8984840"," I think it was March 13th of 2022. "
"8988060","8988860"," Right here."
"8994680","8998340"," We did was we had this, like we had this, like move higher here, right?"
"8998660","8999640"," And then we slam down."
"9003680","9007080"," And this this week, I can show you this in 2008, 2000. "
"9007080","9008160"," They can show it to you 87."
"9009380","9010560"," Any other time frame."
"9010720","9012160"," We've done this in the program already a couple of times. "
"9012160","9014440"," So just this last little bit down here."
"9015360","9018480"," See that last little bit, this last little leg down."
"9021160","9023920"," And I want you to look at exhibit A down here. "
"9029660","9032000"," And we're kind of showing that right now."
"9033360","9035220"," I'm not saying we get all the way down here."
"9035860","9038020"," I'm not saying that we're going to hit this, but. "
"9042530","9043410"," Right here."
"9043910","9044650"," Did it be?"
"9048010","9048930"," There's a window."
"9049370","9050770"," There's a small window. "
"9056260","9059360"," Or it could be like that squeeze up and then the blast down, right?"
"9059620","9061340"," Or we just blast right down here."
"9062160","9065400"," So there's like this risk window here that we're in the next week or so."
"9065560","9070000"," Next couple of weeks where we're in a risk window to have that last capitulation move. "
"9070320","9070520"," So."
"9072380","9075580"," You know, like on a smaller time frame."
"9075780","9077500"," Yeah, can we squeeze up into the belt today?"
"9077500","9082320"," Yeah, we squeeze up into FMC or even on FMC day. "
"9082540","9082700"," Yes."
"9084440","9086500"," But behind the scenes, underneath the covers."
"9089220","9092260"," There's a risk, there's an inherent risk to the market. "
"9093780","9096200"," To do a fast rollover and it could be fast."
"9096460","9097980"," It could be like over the course of a few days."
"9099040","9101320"," Could be over the course of a week. "
"9102340","9105220"," Now we have this one quick blast down to the market."
"9109180","9110080"," So it's there."
"9113300","9114540"," It's certainly there. "
"9118710","9120550"," Oh, yeah, print the call side for me."
"9122110","9123610"," Please print the call side."
"9144610","9146270"," All right, so I'm out of puts now. "
"9146310","9147270"," I'm just long the market."
"9154180","9155940"," Please don't roll this shit over here."
"9156040","9157100"," Please just hold this shit. "
"9159340","9160760"," Long calls, I should say."
"9167090","9168270"," They roll this shit over."
"9168410","9169350"," I'm going to wrap it up for the day. "
"9169470","9170830"," I think and not trade anything."
"9172150","9175810"," They try any kind of like nonsense where they do this fast roll down here."
"9175910","9177250"," Some kind of stupid shit like that. "
"9181010","9183570"," And my calls are fucking right back where they were this morning."
"9190150","9192210"," Made some money on some puts earlier too."
"9192650","9194930"," So I'm pretty much flat right now. "
"9195570","9197870"," I think I might be down like 12 cents or something in the day."
"9197870","9209130"," I agree, Damien."
"9210050","9211010"," I agree, Damien. "
"9212650","9213990"," I'm with you on this, Damien."
"9219520","9220800"," These aren't look back charts."
"9221080","9222260"," I apologize to you. "
"9222260","9224360"," If you thought I showed you a look back chart, I did not."
"9226000","9227120"," That's not a look back chart."
"9227340","9228780"," That's a market velocity chart. "
"9231320","9234320"," And you're seeing declining momentum and velocity in the market right now."
"9234900","9238060"," And they're used to predict much stock market crashes successfully."
"9240900","9241700"," Quite successfully. "
"9244900","9247240"," They're one of the only ways to predict the stock market crash."
"9247560","9250680"," One of the most one of the most clear ways to predict a crash."
"9257800","9264660"," It's one of the only ways that you can see if banks are long and like if they're truly long"
"9264660","9265540"," in the market or not. "
"9266240","9271320"," As a matter of fact, you can go back and you may not like this guy, but I don't agree."
"9271320","9273940"," I agree with his politics at all, but go and check out."
"9276480","9277300"," What's his name again?"
"9277640","9278260"," Zero hedge. "
"9279160","9282480"," And he shows you that there's no money in this market right now."
"9282640","9285900"," We can either squeeze really high or we could be down 300 points tomorrow."
"9286980","9288560"," He was able to pinpoint it as well. "
"9290180","9291580"," There's no liquidity in this market."
"9291960","9292900"," There's no cash in this market."
"9293440","9296740"," The price of the market is being held up by no money in the market. "
"9298040","9301220"," So at any moment they can sell this market and it would be violent."
"9319420","9320320"," It doesn't mean we crash."
"9320460","9321900"," It just means that we're set up for it. "
"9333080","9334780"," You can go right on to a Twitter."
"9334940","9336020"," You can go right on Twitter and find them."
"9337460","9338480"," Look right on them. "
"9338620","9339560"," Look up a liquidity."
"9339840","9343020"," Do a Twitter search liquidity in the stock market."
"9344960","9348920"," Then all time low going back to March 15th or 13th. "
"9348920","9350820"," These are all facts data."
"9352500","9353580"," Can't argue with facts."
"9353940","9354340"," Those are facts. "
"9363680","9366260"," It doesn't like crystal ball time or none of that stuff."
"9384160","9385420"," Yeah, it's all based on liquidity."
"9391640","9394260"," So what declining velocity declining liquidity in the market. "
"9395860","9397720"," It's oftentimes how they sell this market."
"9403780","9406100"," I'm not a crash bear."
"9406340","9407280"," Like you got to understand I'm a bull. "
"9407280","9410160"," All I can do is just see."
"9411060","9412380"," You can see it in March."
"9413240","9415440"," You can see it in January of 2022 as well. "
"9416680","9417440"," In December."
"9417880","9419060"," Well, that didn't start in December."
"9419140","9420020"," It started in September. "
"9422580","9424280"," And it led into January."
"9425840","9427440"," You can just see it happening in the background."
"9427740","9429460"," Even though price was trading higher. "
"9441320","9443420"," I think we've made videos back then saying."
"9443420","9447180"," I think I remember the video saying sell out of Apple."
"9447780","9451720"," And there's a high chance that Apple will still trade higher and it did. "
"9451840","9455060"," It squeezed higher into the last three months of 2021, I believe."
"9456980","9458580"," We'll just kind of follow that same path."
"9459000","9459840"," And we're right there again. "
"9460360","9461560"," It kind of sucks, right?"
"9475950","9477310"," A bull plane possible."
"9477630","9478370"," I'm hoping right here, man."
"9481670","9484810"," One of my my fear is right now is they roll this shit over right. "
"9484810","9485990"," Just like this."
"9486210","9486510"," Wham."
"9486790","9487650"," Right back down. "
"9488230","9489350"," Staircases straight down."
"9492310","9493270"," Kind of a slow day."
"9493370","9494250"," I'll be honest with you. "
"9494550","9498090"," I don't want to trade this right here at all."
"9498650","9499610"," I'm like no interest in it."
"9511620","9512980"," There's a one minute chart right here. "
"9519540","9520220"," Gaps above."
"9520960","9521960"," Three ninety six thirteen."
"9542860","9544600"," Yeah, I've got a future's market too. "
"9546100","9546880"," I've got a."
"9548040","9551340"," You guys will get access to this till you build the user in every ticker out there."
"9552040","9554940"," You're going to use it for futures market and cash market as well."
"9558290","9559410"," You get access to it. "
"9559510","9559750"," I promise."
"9560150","9562570"," You really go back historically and look and see it happening."
"9562770","9566530"," Points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up. "
"9566730","9568370"," You get in the next month or so."
"9573050","9574470"," Start squeezing, baby."
"9583800","9584640"," Come on. "
"9587560","9587960"," Oh."
"9595560","9596360"," Start squeezing."
"9598020","9603860"," I feel like I'm being I feel like I'm being teased. "
"9612320","9613180"," Yeah, I got you guys."
"9613260","9614100"," I got you guys all covered."
"9614940","9616840"," You guys are you guys will like seeing this. "
"9620420","9622060"," Yeah, it'll work for European markets."
"9622320","9623120"," Work for the world markets."
"9623460","9623780"," So. "
"9624660","9625480"," Work for everything."
"9626120","9627740"," And we're going to actually offer that too."
"9628220","9631420"," So you're going to get data depending upon what you want for feeds. "
"9631900","9634160"," If you want like us major market feeds."
"9634440","9634860"," If you want."
"9637000","9638440"," Like European market feeds. "
"9640400","9641240"," But they're expense."
"9641460","9644280"," They're expensive to us like the US market feeds."
"9644920","9648640"," I think the I think it all costs like or not all but just the data feeds. "
"9648640","9651740"," I think cost 15 grand a month or something that cheap."
"9652260","9655800"," But you'll be able to use them on all markets real time."
"9656840","9659660"," And there's a cheaper feed that some of you guys are like, I don't want to pay that. "
"9659660","9663200"," You're going to get the you can get a delayed feed of like 15 minutes."
"9663940","9669340"," Which still works for for you don't need like some of you probably want or need."
"9670060","9670840"," Real time. "
"9671660","9675720"," But for most of you that are most of you just need the delayed feed because it'll give you the"
"9675720","9676040"," levels."
"9682260","9685420"," Grifts trimming in saying XLF and carry with a small bounce here."
"9689200","9691020"," No, I don't think zero hedges one guy. "
"9691460","9693040"," I don't think so."
"9693580","9695700"," I think a lot of it's probably automated too, right."
"9696240","9700240"," And then they like jump in and make comments or make posts of what's interest them. "
"9711810","9715210"," What cost 15 came up real time data real time charts."
"9717070","9718150"," Do they're doing it again?"
"9718430","9719510"," What the fuck man?"
"9719890","9720770"," This is good."
"9721410","9721910"," I'm going to cool. "
"9722050","9724930"," Dude, I'm going to."
"9727100","9727500"," God."
"9727940","9729660"," So this is what I'm going to say right now. "
"9730000","9733320"," This is what I'm going to say."
"9733360","9736380"," If we get a squeeze here, I'm going to close the calls and I'm going to be flat."
"9736380","9737920"," I'm probably not going to trade the rest of the day. "
"9738260","9739760"," I have zero interest in this day."
"9740240","9740660"," Like none."
"9742500","9742880"," Zero. "
"9746080","9749140"," I'll hang out with you guys for the day, but I'm not trading it."
"9755340","9756440"," Hey, what's up, Alvar?"
"9756600","9756920"," How are you?"
"9765830","9772190"," Yeah, I have no interest here."
"9772590","9772750"," Zero. "
"9773750","9775650"," Maybe later in the day and a day."
"9775650","9781150"," I'm interested in seeing like, um, I'm interested in seeing if they rip Tesla end of day."
"9804010","9805070"," He got some sleep. "
"9806870","9808530"," I could use a long weekend here."
"9808670","9809630"," I'm going to stop talking."
"9812290","9814190"," Like rest my voice for two or three days. "
"9827570","9828210"," Oh, yes."
"9828390","9830010"," The 15 K is for real time data."
"9830190","9835650"," It's expensive as fuck like the data feeds are expensive to run with the charts and stuff. "
"9835650","9838890"," Uh, that, that alone is 15 K a month."
"9839110","9845370"," So this, this, the weird part about this website is like, uh, we either need it to gain traction."
"9845370","9847850"," It needs to gain traction so it can support itself. "
"9848390","9851850"," If it doesn't, um, we'll end up having to scale it back."
"9852970","9855450"," Uh, but I think it'll get some traction."
"9855830","9857590"," So it needs to pay for itself. "
"9858870","9864610"," Uh, I think the website every month's probably going to cost roughly like 20 to 30 K to run a"
"9864610","9864870"," minimum."
"9865650","9866270"," Somewhere in there."
"9867830","9868710"," Uh, complete. "
"9885090","9888330"," Still losing my, uh, losing my shit over here."
"9902160","9905960"," Jimmy saying I'm, uh, um, y'all caps Jimmy, right?"
"9906160","9907000"," Jimmy Bear is getting away."
"9907460","9910760"," Jimmy Bear is like, how many caps can I put in a post before they block it?"
"9912640","9914140"," I'm modeling Tesla today. "
"9914140","9916560"," One 82 50 calls and one 75 puts."
"9916580","9917680"," There are a lot of those credits."
"9917740","9920960"," We see a few teams to work on scenarios for bank. "
"9921460","9923060"," Yeah, I like that idea too, Jimmy."
"9923600","9924720"," I think it's a good idea with Tesla."
"9926420","9931840"," If any guys are longtime Tesla traders, uh, it's set up right now for one of those days, isn't it?"
"9932180","9936480"," You guys remember like old school Tesla days where like we come into an opx or a mopex. "
"9937840","9942160"," And they would just rip it like 90 points up, 90 points down both sides."
"9944920","9950100"," Not 90, but like 30 points up, 30 points down wild ass swings in it."
"9963260","9964620"," Don't be offended by my caps. "
"9964920","9965640"," Just get the message."
"9968840","9970000"," I love you, man."
"9984380","9987800"," Uh, so gaining access to the full off way based on a number of subscribers, I guess. "
"9988060","9988060"," Yeah."
"9988580","9992840"," Uh, no, we have a, we're trying to plan out what it's going to cost, like how many subscribers do"
"9992840","9993400"," we need for."
"9993980","9995260"," Uh, depending on the day that you're getting. "
"10007100","10008300"," All right, legend, I'll talk to you."
"10015740","10017960"," I'll reach out, uh, legend, talk to you."
"10019500","10022740"," I might have a Joe Donut contact you at some point. "
"10032790","10038750"," Yeah, I'm going to take a break here."
"10038850","10039410"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"10039910","10041730"," Uh, 1225 in the afternoon. "
"10042270","10043290"," So the stream is going to stay up."
"10043370","10044210"," I'm going to go grab a sandwich."
"10044810","10048370"," Someone else in the stream is, or my tech saying they're grabbing a sandwich. "
"10048570","10049430"," I'm going to grab a sandwich too."
"10049430","10052130"," Uh, so I am along the market right now."
"10052550","10053430"," Uh, stream stays up. "
"10053850","10057570"," Um, do you guys want to put on, I'm just going to put something on the background for you to"
"10057570","10057970"," listen to?"
"10063580","10066780"," The UN court issues an arrest warrant for Russia's Putin."
"10067440","10070160"," I'm having, uh, display issues this morning too."
"10071560","10076060"," Having displays, uh, picking out on me this morning. "
"10077560","10081160"," To give me like, uh, at the work of my display in the background, I'm missing like a bunch of"
"10081160","10082140"," what you guys are saying in the chat."
"10083060","10084860"," Um, I am along the market right now."
"10087600","10090220"," Uh, I'll put on something in the background for you. "
"10091340","10102240"," Uh, dude,"
"10102340","10102980"," I can't even do that."
"10103100","10103760"," My, my displays."
"10105620","10107720"," Give me, uh, give me like 15 minutes. "
"10107740","10108320"," I'll be right back."
"10274460","10276960"," This is the awful truth."
"10283840","10286720"," There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. "
"10293190","10298470"," This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of."
"10298470","10302930"," Especially at your age with your own grandchild."
"10303290","10303410"," Yeah. "
"10303890","10305970"," My grandma is having to sue them."
"10306430","10308270"," I'm testifying against them."
"10308530","10309390"," Nobody's talking. "
"10309750","10311210"," They're one floor below right now."
"10311450","10313290"," I get afraid to go on the elevator."
"10313850","10316630"," It's sad that it had to devolve to this. "
"10317310","10318970"," It's like a soap opera to me."
"10319170","10320170"," It's a very sad thing."
"10320490","10321370"," It's a family feud. "
"10321930","10322950"," A family."
"10323990","10329730"," Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet."
"10330110","10333130"," At the end of the day, it's seem to sort of rip everybody apart. "
"10334290","10343870"," Hi, my name is Tom Schoenberg."
"10344170","10346250"," I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News."
"10346930","10347950"," I cover financial enforcement. "
"10348670","10354570"," I was approached by someone close to the Schottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be"
"10354570","10361530"," interested in writing about Beverly Schottenstein and this case that she had against JP Morgan."
"10362250","10366270"," And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told."
"10367670","10373510"," So I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me and"
"10373510","10379690"," included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was"
"10379690","10381270"," actually going on with her money. "
"10382510","10388370"," Beverly obtained her wealth from the Schottenstein kind of retail empire that has at times included"
"10388370","10393170"," big lots, value city, American Eagle Outfitters, DSW shoes."
"10393910","10399070"," Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them"
"10399070","10401250"," an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990."
"10402150","10404330"," Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. "
"10405330","10410370"," She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors."
"10410890","10416210"," Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors."
"10416890","10424370"," She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trustee of her"
"10424370","10425170"," entire estate. "
"10427090","10430990"," Managing sort of family money is not a conflict."
"10430990","10434390"," In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start."
"10434570","10438210"," It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. "
"10439030","10444270"," But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016."
"10445650","10453330"," Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own"
"10453330","10456990"," experiences, it was hard to really put it together."
"10457750","10462690"," She had written a check to her caretaker dawn that bounced. "
"10463490","10468270"," So she went down to her local Chase branch to sort of find out what was going on."
"10468510","10473470"," She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her"
"10473470","10477350"," statements having to do with her checking account in her credit card account."
"10477730","10480890"," So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. "
"10481490","10487490"," And she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page."
"10488190","10493230"," And it was there, she saw all sorts of charges that she said she didn't authorize or didn't know"
"10493230","10493490"," about."
"10493950","10496790"," I was becoming very, very suspicious. "
"10497670","10503950"," I was starting to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money"
"10503950","10504730"," was going."
"10505090","10507130"," And I was not a big spender."
"10508410","10513850"," Around the same time dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below"
"10513850","10520810"," her, came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including"
"10520810","10525510"," some with JP Morgan letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding"
"10525510","10527330"," documents over and over. "
"10527550","10530130"," Yeah, they came in one morning."
"10530130","10534570"," I threw the back door and they brought this shredder inside."
"10536010","10541170"," And then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers. "
"10541990","10543390"," And they started doing it."
"10543830","10549070"," I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers."
"10549670","10552410"," Beverly said that they had done this many times before. "
"10553070","10560110"," That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book."
"10560410","10563090"," And it's a diary and she started writing."
"10563450","10566130"," Each day she would write a little at a time. "
"10569010","10574770"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"10584560","10585360"," Squeeze them."
"10586280","10586860"," Hold on. "
"10586940","10587980"," I'm eating the sandwich in the background."
"10592350","10620220"," That was"
"10620220","10620860"," pretty good, right?"
"10630040","10631920"," Glad I closed my puts at least."
"10634930","10639010"," Got a bare aeroplane starting up here. "
"10639790","10643770"," Let's see if the bowls can put some sauce together here."
"10659620","10663340"," We've got some we've got some places of interest above."
"10663400","10665720"," We've got this this right back here. "
"10667020","10671240"," To the first place we're looking for for a target."
"10675630","10677050"," Maybe right in here."
"10683880","10684820"," Scene of the crime. "
"10686240","10688400"," We have another scene of the crime back here."
"10688560","10689560"," You see this scene right here?"
"10689800","10690760"," Scene of the crime right here."
"10700900","10702360"," Fucking futures, man. "
"10702600","10703900"," I fucking hate futures."
"10705860","10707300"," I should say that."
"10707520","10708840"," I swore again, too. "
"10709520","10710200"," No swearing."
"10710840","10712860"," I told myself it would stop swearing."
"10717200","10718520"," Okay, so right there. "
"10718620","10720560"," Got a PT two above PT one right here."
"10721200","10724060"," If this can sort itself out and come higher."
"10724660","10727220"," Need price to stay above 390 58. "
"10727960","10729040"," It's a one minute chart."
"10729300","10730580"," Let's look at a two minute chart here."
"10731780","10732840"," You can see it right here. "
"10732960","10733660"," This is PT one."
"10734160","10736200"," So the sellers are trying to do a failure."
"10747560","10748700"," Look at him trying to. "
"10748760","10750740"," This is a bigger bear plane in a larger time frame."
"10752880","10754300"," See that bear plane right there?"
"10755200","10755780"," Sellers, man."
"10755900","10756920"," They're just everywhere right now. "
"10756960","10758300"," Just selling into strength."
"10758340","10760200"," You see it right here in the 15 minute chart."
"10763260","10764300"," It's kind of gross. "
"10766280","10767400"," See it right there?"
"10768240","10769380"," More sellers coming in."
"10772300","10773780"," Just teeing off above."
"10775280","10778760"," So yet it looks bullish on a five minute, but on the. "
"10780420","10783520"," One hour and on the 15 minutes looking bearish, right?"
"10783860","10784800"," Overall, it's looking bearish here."
"10785740","10788960"," Just selling into strength right now in the spot, just a shitty day."
"10791020","10792380"," It's like hot garbage. "
"10798140","10799180"," It's like right here."
"10799260","10802080"," The five minute looks bullish, but on higher time frames."
"10803020","10803980"," It doesn't. "
"10804960","10807660"," It's like teeing off, teeing off, teeing off."
"10811030","10812950"," So I don't know if we squeeze a roll, but."
"10814650","10816490"," I can't give it to either side here. "
"10816530","10817170"," It's OPEC."
"10817450","10820890"," So probably should have sold calls up here and I didn't."
"10820890","10821650"," I've held them so. "
"10825950","10830950"," I'm actually up on calls right now, but I'm going to eat my sandwich here."
"10831070","10831250"," Hold on."
"10877310","10878410"," But I'll be honest with you. "
"10879710","10882790"," So like looking at this normally in a normal day, be like, guys, this is bullish."
"10882990","10886230"," We're going up, but I'll tell you what, we got higher time frames."
"10887730","10891490"," We're really going to moon squeeze this into the end of the day, or they are going to roll it"
"10891490","10891690"," over. "
"10891890","10893650"," So I can't."
"10893650","10898130"," I don't like trading this day at all here."
"10901250","10902310"," And you can see it right. "
"10902410","10905010"," We squeeze higher and now they're going to try to roll it over real quick."
"10905190","10906630"," Watch them try to roll this over right now."
"10918190","10921190"," Yeah, I'm going to wind up selling here in just a minute. "
"10926720","10929800"," Let's just selling into strength, selling into strength, selling into strength."
"10936580","10938680"," Let me finish my, let me finish my lunch here."
"10938840","10938980"," Hold on. "
"10953370","10957930"," Yeah, captain Ron 19 is saying the spy looks like hot garbage on the R side of the 15."
"10958430","10959830"," Yeah, Ron, look at, um."
"10961230","10964930"," Look on the hourly, the 15, the 15 minute, the hourly and the deli looks like dog shit. "
"10965090","10965770"," Pure dog shit."
"11001180","11003360"," So Captain Ron's making a very good point."
"11003700","11006700"," And so I want to mute this here so you can see it. "
"11007160","11010020"," The book map real quick and see what he's talking about."
"11010020","11016920"," So like the one minute and the five minute looks pretty good, right?"
"11018720","11020140"," Like it's setting up to go higher."
"11021120","11028920"," But then when you switch over to the 15 minute and a higher time frame, there's a massive bear flag"
"11028920","11029280"," here. "
"11032140","11033760"," Looks like a bull trap, doesn't it?"
"11034520","11036280"," They're just teeing off right there."
"11039560","11040580"," Sellers are right there."
"11040720","11046060"," Just any kind of strength, boom, selling into it for a roll lower on a higher time frame. "
"11046060","11048200"," Looks like dog shit right here."
"11049640","11051220"," On an hourly, it's even worse, right?"
"11056780","11058560"," Same thing here on an hourly."
"11061950","11063050"," Just slam. "
"11065690","11067050"," Looks like dog shit."
"11070320","11070780"," Daily."
"11072640","11073600"," Same thing. "
"11075200","11077800"," Just pounding down, pounding down."
"11080580","11082540"," Bears want that close below 380."
"11084300","11085140"," They want that weekly. "
"11086120","11086760"," We're down here."
"11086880","11086960"," I apologize."
"11087600","11088540"," This one right here is what they want. "
"11089100","11091620"," They want that close down here if they can get it on the weekly."
"11093440","11095540"," And they also want the no lower high, right?"
"11095860","11098500"," Inside week or no, or inside day, excuse me."
"11098680","11099420"," Inside day. "
"11100700","11102040"," Turn the weekly in a dog shit."
"11105280","11106300"," You got a 15 minute."
"11106420","11107560"," That's not a good look right there. "
"11110020","11111360"," Not a good look right there at all."
"11114300","11115480"," 391, 75."
"11117200","11118980"," Even these boxes mean nothing right. "
"11119140","11120840"," Can we get up there and actually tag that PT1?"
"11120980","11121640"," I doubt it right here."
"11122100","11122600"," Doesn't look good."
"11122740","11123980"," Doesn't look good for bulls right here. "
"11127240","11129340"," Looks like it's just going to roll over here at some point."
"11132600","11134120"," Just big old staircase down."
"11135800","11156300"," Slam, 386.29. Yeah,"
"11166940","11167940"," it looks like it's going to roll right over. "
"11168840","11169600"," I don't like this."
"11169740","11171000"," I don't like anything about these charts."
"11171140","11172620"," I don't like anything about trading this right now. "
"11172720","11173000"," Nothing."
"11179900","11181760"," Let me finish my sandwich there."
"11184800","11185980"," And on the other side of it, right?"
"11186160","11190460"," The moment the other side of this tier two is the moment that they lift the hedges off the spy. "
"11191840","11192460"," The ripped faces."
"11195020","11195760"," So I don't know."
"11200390","11202150"," I'm going to finish the rest of my sandwich. "
"11202150","11203130"," I'll give you just another second."
"11220500","11221940"," So I'm saying there's a chance."
"11222060","11222700"," The other is a chance. "
"11223800","11258890"," No criminal"
"11258890","11260150"," court is issued."
"11260730","11267050"," The international criminal court is issued two words of arrest in the U.K. situation for Vladimir"
"11267050","11273410"," Putin, president of the Russian Federation, and for Ma'il Vova-Bereva, commissioner of the Russian"
"11273410","11279690"," president from children's rights for the alleged war crimes of deportation of children from"
"11279690","11282630"," Ukrainian occupied territories into the Russian Federation."
"11283470","11286810"," This is an important moment in the process of justice before the ICC. "
"11287410","11294070"," The judges have reviewed the information and evidence submitted by the prosecutor and determined"
"11294070","11301030"," that there are credible allegations against these persons for the alleged crimes."
"11302590","11305870"," The ICC is doing its part of work."
"11306790","11314470"," As a court of law, the judges issued the rest of the world's execution depends on international"
"11314470","11315070"," cooperation. "
"11318010","11327330"," That is a spokesperson for the UN on a criminal court issued arrest warrants for a Russian"
"11327330","11328570"," president, Vladimir Putin."
"11467160","11470640"," So let's take a look at, I'll read some of this to you right now."
"11477570","11480810"," I was just thinking too, I'm like, you know this box right here, this yellow box?"
"11484180","11485480"," It's more like this big. "
"11487500","11488500"," It really is."
"11488640","11492640"," And every time frame looking at it, I'm like, I'm looking at every time frame and I'm like, yeah,"
"11492740","11493400"," it's a pretty big box."
"11494300","11501120"," So just seeing a piece from a corner stream media here, starting an easy to be official to easy to"
"11501120","11501440"," be inside. "
"11501580","11507380"," They say I'd support another 50 basis point hike in May unless the economy or core HICP softens."
"11507860","11509500"," That's looking into this DCB inside."
"11509660","11512280"," It says there's no doubt that we are still in tightening mode. "
"11512660","11514320"," There's a no hurry to decide on the next move."

"15157840","15159760"," And slam this up into the bell."
"15175020","15178780"," You can't really on a day like today it's hard to correlate to anything right now. "
"15178960","15179740"," On a day like today."
"15182040","15183900"," Correlations kind of forget throwing out the window."
"15183960","15186060"," There's so much volume in the market right now. "
"15186600","15190700"," So much going on the background of the market that a lot of the a lot of like a lot"
"15190700","15193260"," of your setups are like yeah we can do this we can do that."
"15193900","15195660"," And but it doesn't really work out right."
"15195860","15199500"," That's because of the volume that's taking place in the background of the market market mechanics. "
"15258740","15259980"," Yeah, I'm watching a."
"15262900","15263900"," BAC right now."

"15331460","15333600"," They've been buying the queue since early January."
"15334700","15335540"," They're all hiding in there."
"15335680","15336040"," They don't care. "
"15337280","15337600"," They'll hold."
"15337700","15338960"," They'll dive in hand the cues right."
"15339520","15342900"," They'll dive in hand the cues with test with Apple blasting down to 135. "
"15345060","15346240"," They're hiding out in the cues."
"15346240","15347300"," Thanks are."
"15353130","15354630"," Yeah, they're just hiding out in the cues. "
"15382480","15388280"," So glad right now that I'm not in a position like oh man, I'm so glad right now."

"15421440","15423080"," What does it smell like out there?"
"15441650","15442790"," Yeah, clap spares."
"15442910","15448190"," I'm assuming clap spares are at home right now just like praying to the bear gods for their last"
"15448190","15448830"," leg down. "
"15455910","15461110"," I'm assuming that there's a big like collapse conference club bear or like bear copa apocalypse a"
"15461110","15461990"," conference right now."
"15462530","15471440"," But I think even a bull would like that right if book get like a nice blast down like 300"
"15471440","15472400"," points or something."
"15473080","15476400"," Over the next week or so some to buy like who bought it. "
"15476400","15479080"," Take my money."
"15479300","15479820"," Let's go."
"15483880","15485000"," Conferences in the discord. "
"15487860","15510800"," Yeah, I"
"15510800","15513440"," give the bear or Jimmy saints about 391."
"15515120","15519360"," You know, bulls have a small shot if we get a close up here."
"15520280","15522820"," But man in a weekly, it looks like dog shit. "
"15523180","15524300"," It really does."
"15524520","15525380"," It's going to look ugly."
"15525380","15527500"," It's closing candle today is important. "
"15528220","15529180"," That's what I'm looking for."
"15530000","15535680"," I'm most interested in like my my interest in today only lies in what do we close at."
"15537280","15538740"," For an outlook for next week. "
"15546800","15548960"," It looks like it's going to close on the inside."
"15550300","15556240"," And then they'll use the FMC for do we rip or we're face or we grab some liquidity and head"
"15556240","15556480"," lower."

"15570910","15572390"," Yeah, it's kind of the last thing, right?"
"15572670","15575630"," The last thing that they have is FOMC after that."
"15575730","15576690"," I don't know what else they're going to have."
"15581390","15582770"," Yeah, once that all comes off. "
"15583110","15585590"," I don't know what other do you have anything other events planned?"
"15585730","15586010"," I don't know."

"15589990","15590830"," Take quick potty break. "
"15590890","15591390"," I'll be right back."

"15786150","15787770"," Squeezing back above right now."
"15792380","15796740"," Somebody tell Southside to just take the fucking hedge off the market for 15 minutes. "
"15810650","15812170"," Yeah, Matthew, I'm feeling it."
"15813350","15815150"," I just want to see us get above right here, man."
"15818210","15819430"," I'm feeling that squeeze. "
"15820050","15822570"," The only problem that I see here, Ryan, or Matt, is the."
"15829740","15831460"," Hold on a second there."
"15839780","15841220"," Higher time frames, Matthew. "
"15841580","15843120"," There's a lot of cell pressure here."
"15846000","15851080"," But I would love to see that OPEC's just rip face right up into this bell right here."
"15861400","15865620"," You need to know the exact exit time for my Tesla zero to eight yellow calls. "
"15869260","15870700"," Yeah, cues are bullshit, man."
"15870880","15871620"," Cues are looking great."
"15876380","15879380"," Tesla, some targets above. "
"15882500","15884400"," 181.45 is danger."
"15887960","15889500"," 184.83 is danger."
"15890340","15892220"," The best trade on Tesla is above. "
"15893540","15893920"," 185."
"15913210","15914990"," Yeah, I might have to take some here."
"15918270","15921570"," I want to take like a thousand serious. "
"15925630","15932050"," I want to take like a thousand three ninety six calls for like six cents each."
"15932930","15935850"," I want to take like a thousand of them."
"15938890","15942750"," Like I want to make a yellow bed on the clothes that we just rip faces all the way up"
"15942750","15942950"," there. "
"15946720","15947960"," Pretty, pretty badly."
"15954790","15966940"," Not quite"
"15966940","15967740"," there yet though."
"15968220","15969120"," Missville looks great. "
"15969320","15970440"," It's trading off its hourly."
"15972240","15973580"," It's looking good."
"15973760","15976600"," I mean, it's a little toppy on its, it's a little toppy. "
"15976780","15977420"," I apologize."
"15977800","15978000"," You're right."
"15978300","15979260"," Microsoft's a little toppy here. "
"15979780","15983980"," A little toppy."
"15984740","15988300"," I'd be looking for Microsoft to retest the highs, maybe roll over."
"15997460","15999720"," I'll wait all day long if I have to get this trade. "
"16000000","16005900"," So if I have to sit here for seven hours to get this trade out, I will."
"16008360","16009500"," I just need this one."
"16009700","16010340"," I mean, it's right there. "
"16010460","16011020"," I can see it."
"16015600","16018520"," I'm really looking for it, but truthfully, what I really want to see."
"16020220","16023340"," I want to see a failure to make a new low like right here. "
"16024380","16026260"," I can see a failure to make a new low down here."
"16027840","16029640"," And then snap that right up there."
"16030160","16030980"," Just like that. "
"16031340","16031980"," Just a failure."
"16032440","16032620"," Wham."
"16033120","16037160"," Get a really cheap price on something that's briefly outside of the money. "
"16038260","16039760"," Still has some juice on it."
"16041280","16043340"," And just rip faces into that bell over there."
"16043640","16046760"," But it's been a, it's been a, it's been a sit around and fuck around all day long kind of"
"16046760","16046920"," day. "
"16047660","16049300"," And I don't like, I don't, not a goal."
"16049580","16051360"," I mean, I'd watch gold, but I don't trade gold."
"16062790","16063490"," Yeah, don mafia. "
"16063730","16063950"," I'm not."
"16065590","16066890"," It's looking a little toppy there."
"16070450","16071870"," Or at least I'll show it to you real quick. "
"16072010","16073590"," If you want, I'll show it to you brother."
"16073590","16073950"," Hold on."
"16087630","16090410"," Just on the, just on the basis of. "
"16093870","16094670"," Velocity here."
"16095490","16097290"," The day looks a little light."
"16098690","16100430"," But it can keep going up too. "
"16101830","16103350"," And it's in no way done."
"16103510","16104570"," I want you to see that like overall."
"16106210","16107170"," Let's look right here. "
"16107350","16109170"," So you get the roll over right there."
"16109770","16111330"," But then it's going to continue higher."
"16111330","16114350"," So like I'm overall, I'm bullish on Microsoft. "
"16119960","16121380"," Just maybe not on the day."
"16121720","16127640"," So if I'm not completely bullish on Microsoft here, I'd be looking for something like."
"16131260","16132940"," You know, this is kind of a failure here. "
"16132940","16134440"," And then this would come up here."
"16134900","16136480"," This all this stuff comes over."
"16136520","16139260"," There's a nice dip bite out of like 276 or so. "
"16140040","16142340"," And then a continuation higher from Microsoft."
"16142900","16144800"," So I'm not like bearish on Microsoft or anything."
"16144800","16147700"," It's more like just it's taking a breather. "
"16148760","16150660"," I'd like to see it take a breather."
"16152040","16154340"," I don't think it needs to come back down to 257."
"16154600","16155520"," I just think it's. "
"16156500","16158160"," Just cool off a little bit."
"16158400","16160480"," I'm waiting to take another bass ripper higher."
"16165880","16166760"," Cool it off. "
"16167080","16167180"," Bam."
"16167520","16169020"," Get all these averages underneath here."
"16170720","16172020"," More rocket ship fuel. "
"16179490","16182410"," This is like what is this 1600 right here."
"16184910","16187370"," So maybe Microsoft into the bell."
"16188910","16193810"," That's four p.m. So you get this little cool down period, maybe. "
"16194290","16198150"," And then you get that nice giant squeeze up into four p.m. right there."
"16204300","16205140"," That's MSFT."
"16218740","16220540"," I get my weakness right now. "
"16220940","16221900"," Please give it to me."
"16223060","16224560"," Please give me that weakness."
"16231980","16233460"," Come on down, baby. "
"16234420","16236100"," Show me that red box down there."
"16236260","16238180"," Hit that hit that hit that red down there."
"16239780","16240180"," 3930. "
"16246160","16247100"," Come on down."
"16247960","16249020"," Come on down, Spy."
"16252340","16253700"," Come on down. "
"16267200","16268220"," Garbage in here, right?"
"16268620","16270760"," Oh, one, two, three, four, five."
"16274220","16277800"," Just give me that failure to make a new low down here to the right so I can just take"
"16277800","16278040"," that."
"16278040","16279980"," I can take that scam trade into the close. "
"16282700","16284000"," Imagine if they pin it."
"16284200","16285020"," That would really suck."
"16285200","16292020"," Cause I'm like, I'm sitting here going, maybe I'll buy like 900 calls or something on Spy and on"
"16292020","16292340"," the bell. "
"16292800","16294400"," If they pinned it, I'd be torched."
"16295360","16296740"," I want to see how much that's going to cost me."
"16296840","16297060"," Hold on. "
"16332770","16333710"," It's not that bad."
"16333910","16335670"," It's like eight grand or something 10 grand."
"16357600","16359600"," Just like send this down here. "
"16364660","16365840"," Just like that, man."
"16366020","16367220"," Just send that down there for me."
"16369800","16370920"," Just whipsaw it. "
"16374990","16375970"," Give me that whipsaw."
"16391930","16393810"," Just want that whipsaw action, baby."
"16394550","16395110"," Bring it on down. "
"16397450","16398330"," The juggernaut."
"16399529","16400490"," The juggernaut."
"16409210","16411130"," One odor of freaking is coming right up. "
"16414310","16416070"," Just give me the juggernaut."
"16416650","16419750"," Make the whole world think it's crashing and then whipsaw it right up."
"16424860","16428180"," So there's a, in YouTube, there's a, there's a link in YouTube. "
"16429140","16433960"," It's for a captain's book recommendations, hedge fund market wizards, how winning traders win."
"16435419","16437140"," There's a book that I've read on the show."
"16438680","16445160"," You don't actually have to buy it, but if you do click through it, it will help support the"
"16445160","16445439"," channel. "
"16446480","16450740"," It'll put a cookie for when you buy stuff on Amazon for three days."
"16451119","16452340"," No longer, just three days."
"16452680","16457360"," If you use Amazon, I want to support the stream without giving me an actual tip. "
"16457800","16462759"," If you click through that link, what it'll do is bring a little bit of money in my way."
"16462919","16467400"," The prices that you pay on Amazon for your goods and services doesn't change."
"16467960","16473140"," So if anything, it's just taking a little bit of money out of Jeff Bezos's pocket and support an"
"16473140","16474140"," old captain over here. "
"16474820","16478520"," So if you want to support the channel, if you're not making money today, click on that link."
"16479099","16480779"," And you can take a look at that book."
"16480900","16484259"," I do recommend that you read that book, especially where we are in the market. "
"16484700","16486860"," That's a very good book for where we are right now."
"16487880","16492880"," So if you see that popping up inside Twitch or in YouTube, click on that link for like, just click"
"16492880","16495460"," through it into the Amazon app and then I'm in."
"16495460","16497460"," You're in with me for like three days. "
"16498419","16502540"," It's not something that stays in your cookies for like 90 days or 30 days or something like that."
"16503060","16506840"," It doesn't impact the price of goods that you buy from Amazon."
"16507540","16508560"," It just supports the stream. "
"16509200","16510419"," I think a bunch of people clicked on it yesterday."
"16510960","16515220"," I haven't looked to see how many people did, but any of you that did click on it yesterday, I"
"16515220","16515840"," appreciate it."

"16519360","16521660"," Easy, simple way in supporting the stream."
"16521660","16527340"," Then on Twitch, if you subscribe with prime prime members, if you subscribe to the Twitch channel"
"16527340","16534860"," through prime on Amazon, Amazon pays, I think $2.56 every month to us to support the stream."
"16535080","16536020"," It doesn't cost you anything. "
"16536820","16538360"," Another free way to support the stream."

"20404020","20406060"," Just keep squeezing those bears out."
"20406220","20407620"," Just keep squeezing those bears out."
"20407820","20407900"," 317. "
"20409620","20413040"," So I'm going to expect into F1C."
"20417960","20420120"," I love squeezing these bears out."
"20420860","20421840"," Just keep squeezing these. "
"20421980","20424460"," Squeeze those bears out."
"20425720","20429470"," Just keep squeezing those bears out."
"20430750","20431970"," Just keep squeezing them out. "
"20433050","20434250"," Keep on squeezing them out."
"20435730","20437850"," It's our implied range for the week."
"20437850","20439630"," I want you to see though this right here. "
"20439630","20440750"," This market danger."
"20441950","20442610"," See here."
"20442730","20443190"," Hold on a second. "
"20445660","20447380"," Yeah just keep squeezing those bears out."
"20447520","20449140"," Squeeze every single last one of those guys out."
"20450980","20451460"," 39132. "
"20457320","20458100"," Right there."
"20463540","20464480"," Right in there."
"20465120","20466720"," So the bears are there right here. "
"20467260","20468300"," And they're way up here."
"20469020","20470420"," These are big big sellers."
"20470960","20471960"," Little sellers right here. "
"20477560","20479760"," 396.99. 396."
"20480180","20480800"," None of them up here."
"20480920","20481360"," They're lower. "
"20481580","20482120"," They're right up here."
"20482240","20484000"," 396.99 right here."
"20484820","20486120"," That's where they are right there. "
"20488100","20490200"," That's where the bulls need to be to get some support."
"20492080","20493340"," Big sellers up here."
"20493760","20494760"," Little sellers down here. "
"20496900","20499520"," Some kind of support down here at 386."
"20499920","20500640"," We're going to make this one yellow."
"20511020","20512240"," Make that one yellow. "
"20515140","20516780"," You can see it right there right."
"20517480","20519800"," Let's see the trade right here."
"20519860","20521000"," These sellers are going to want to come in. "
"20521480","20524040"," They start selling us down into next Wednesday down here."
"20524140","20525740"," You see that right down there."
"20551460","20552640"," We saw this down. "
"20552820","20554820"," They'll probably buy this and then bam right there."
"20564130","20565230"," So I'm bearish here."
"20566070","20567550"," I'm just looking at this point. "
"20567670","20568170"," Same as yesterday."
"20568210","20569370"," No difference here."
"20569810","20570810"," I'm looking to sell. "
"20572070","20573630"," I'm looking to sell 39152."
"20574250","20579490"," I'm also looking to sell 396.13. Any kind of a chance for you to get into a put back"
"20579490","20580870"," spread here or even right here."
"20581430","20584330"," I want you to have a hedge on this market heading into Apple. "
"20584330","20585870"," I'm seeing next week."
"20586850","20587330"," Absolutely."
"20587870","20589690"," Just an opportunity to sell this market. "
"20589850","20593990"," If you want to get bullish in this market, you're not getting bullish unless we trade above 396."
"20595790","20597850"," 397.24 somewhere up in here."
"20598350","20600230"," Can't even start the discussion of getting bullish. "
"20601130","20602410"," There's going to be bulls out there."
"20602410","20603210"," They're going to tell you."
"20603330","20604090"," Oh, look, cap. "
"20604250","20605010"," We traded down here."
"20605070","20605470"," We held it."
"20605530","20605970"," We held it. "
"20606030","20606450"," We held it."
"20606670","20609310"," We're going to keep step stoning stone up, up, up."
"20609610","20613370"," The reality is you can't even get bullish though unless you're above this level right here. "
"20613810","20617070"," As far as we know right now, the sellers are here in the market."
"20617070","20618050"," They're selling it down."
"20620310","20620990"," Oh, yeah. "
"20621230","20622070"," Squeeze those bears out."
"20622250","20622650"," Squeeze them."
"20624630","20625710"," Squeeze those bears out. "
"20626690","20630270"," Now with that said, right, expectations into next week."
"20633240","20634300"," I don't think it matters."
"20634760","20637180"," If it's the weekend, futures is going to try to sell you down. "
"20638640","20639880"," I don't think it matters."
"20640080","20643420"," I think that in futures, they'll try to sell you down on Monday on Sunday."
"20644160","20645940"," Any kind of sell every rip here. "
"20646200","20648140"," As far as I'm concerned, it's sell the rip market."
"20649580","20650640"," No, it really is."
"20650780","20651600"," It's sell the rip market. "
"20651980","20654120"," That's what it is until you're above 396."
"20654720","20659360"," So until you're above 396, this is start staircase in the market down time."
"20659940","20662340"," Everything in the market, I've gone over it all week long. "
"20663220","20665100"," Why the market looks so bearish?"
"20666800","20668380"," We checked them all off."
"20668520","20669240"," Check this off."
"20669400","20670060"," Check this off. "
"20670280","20670960"," Check that off."
"20671180","20672240"," This isn't normal either."
"20672380","20673080"," This is not normal. "
"20673740","20678180"," If we were like any of the time of the day of the week a month a year, I would"
"20678180","20680640"," say to you, ah, this is a normal bear."
"20681000","20683840"," Like we're at a bottom, like a bear bottom or something, right?"
"20684640","20688920"," But there are mechanics of the market in the background that are screaming market crash."
"20691080","20691660"," Screaming it. "
"20692940","20695720"," And I can't stress that."
"20695840","20697500"," I cannot stress that enough to you."
"20697900","20702300"," If you're a new follower of this program, you may have missed all of this discussion. "
"20702320","20705540"," It's been taking place this discussion for two years."
"20707120","20712080"," And so at least right now, I said I promised you two years ago, I said if we ever get"
"20712080","20714860"," back to this place in the market, I'll tell you."
"20715000","20715940"," Right now we're there. "
"20716380","20717300"," Right now we're there."
"20718000","20719480"," Been there for a couple weeks now."
"20721240","20723420"," And we've sold down in those couple of weeks, right?"
"20723740","20727160"," Remember, I get on it, I get on a finto it and said, hey, look, we're probably going to go"
"20727160","20728180"," down and crash this market. "
"20728920","20730980"," And it's still looking like that right now."
"20731720","20739020"," On SPX, I've already shown you where that no landing path is above until we start trading 396."
"20739780","20741560"," Can't even have that discussion at this moment. "
"20742100","20744680"," So we'll switch the discussion to that if it happens."
"20745800","20750380"," But the truth is that into next week, you're looking for a place to sell the market."
"20750380","20752540"," You had an opportunity yesterday to do it. "
"20753720","20757880"," I'm going to expect another opportunity to do it this week into next week."
"20758460","20760660"," So let's say we squeeze up into this close."
"20761280","20763640"," We might trade up to close to 396. "
"20765080","20768280"," 397 into Monday or Tuesday or Sunday or maybe over the weekend."
"20769260","20771800"," You might have another opportunity to get short on this market."
"20772300","20775140"," This is not the place to get short in the market for sure. "
"20775960","20778180"," Now they've made another attempt at it today, right?"
"20778180","20780400"," And it hasn't happened at this moment."
"20781880","20783800"," We didn't get it today, right?"
"20783940","20791880"," So you get your chance, didn't happen, reset for short to get lower again on Monday or Tuesday or"
"20791880","20792360"," Wednesday."
"20792960","20795240"," You're going to expect vol into this event. "
"20795760","20798440"," You're going to expect and I'm warning you this over the weekend."
"20798880","20799740"," You're over the weekend."
"20799940","20801540"," You're going to hear Black Monday shit on Twitter. "
"20802200","20803940"," You're going to hear Black Monday shit in the news."
"20804520","20807580"," You're going to hear that we're going to crash next week."
"20807580","20808840"," That's what you're going to hear from people. "
"20809160","20813960"," And that's going to be the expectation from a lot of people is that we crash on Monday, Sunday,"
"20813960","20814400"," Monday."
"20814860","20816780"," We wake up, we're down to 300 points."
"20817320","20821440"," That's going to be the implication from everything that's out there, the way that all the bond"
"20821440","20829260"," markets showing, precious metals, commodities, where the market is long, you're going to hear"
"20829260","20832160"," something about this over the weekend into next week. "
"20832680","20837660"," You're going to hear wild shit from people about what's going to happen at the FOMC meeting."
"20838460","20847040"," The most likely scenario in FOMC is we're raising 25 BPS and we've made no decision on pausing."
"20847980","20850800"," That truly is the most likely scenario. "
"20852320","20859460"," Now, with that said, if we get a rate pause next week, if we get a rate pause next week,"
"20859920","20866180"," it would not shock me in the middle of that being said, like a pausing rates, we're cutting rates,"
"20866400","20867080"," any of that shit."
"20868440","20874340"," It wouldn't shock me to see a straight line up in the market, like a straight V, not even V,"
"20874460","20875340"," like a straight line."
"20875920","20878740"," We go up like 70, 90, 200, 300 points. "
"20879560","20881200"," And then we actually crash the market."
"20881660","20883200"," That wouldn't shock me on a cutting of rates."
"20884420","20889580"," If we stay the course, I would expect the day to be a down day but the market to continue"
"20889580","20890920"," to trade sideways and up. "
"20891520","20899220"," If we get a 50 BPS hike on the FOMC rate decision, I would expect a big move down in"
"20899220","20900280"," the market but a recovery."
"20901860","20908700"," Yeah, 50 BPS, like a sledgehammer or a baseball bat, something like that to the market, I would"
"20908700","20916440"," expect the market to go down pretty significantly, but no market crash, believe it or not, and then"
"20916440","20918140"," trade sideways and to the right and up."
"20918880","20920140"," Something like that. "
"20922100","20927020"," Personally, if you want to know what I think, I think they need to get the rates above the"
"20927020","20927780"," inflation rate."
"20928920","20931660"," They have to not only fight, I mean, they have to."
"20933200","20936920"," This can't be something where we let inflation just run away. "
"20937720","20938680"," It's not going to be good."
"20939280","20940640"," It doesn't end well that way."
"20941220","20946840"," So at least, in my view, if you could at least just hammer it, if they know that we're going"
"20946840","20950540"," to pause, if they know that we don't have many rate cycles ahead of us, just hammer it. "
"20951180","20957960"," Hammer us with 50 BPS, get above or at least matching the rate of inflation so that we can actually"
"20957960","20961500"," attack the rate of inflation, right?"
"20963680","20971580"," We have other stuff to talk about too, with in terms of the recession and maybe the repricing of"
"20971580","20973760"," earning seasons this summer and fall."
"20974280","20977180"," So we've got stuff to do in the marketplace that we haven't done yet."
"20984640","20988660"," So I implore you to have a hedge in this market. "
"20989600","20990520"," I implore you to."
"20990620","20992540"," I implore you to, over the weekend, consider it."
"20993220","20994440"," I implore you to do it. "
"20994560","20996860"," At some point, if you can, put back spreads are free."
"20997700","20999020"," They're literally free."
"20999980","21002680"," You can't get run over in these things unless we trade sideways. "
"21004100","21009820"," There's absolutely no reason not to get, not to have some kind of a hedge in this market."
"21010180","21014260"," Even if we trade it up, there's no reason for you not to be hedged in this market right now."
"21015500","21018280"," And hopefully you get another chance into this close right here. "
"21018380","21024340"," Hopefully today or Monday you get another opportunity and a high to put that hedge on heading into"
"21024340","21024860"," FOMC."
"21037640","21042080"," Now, like if you buy a put back hedge, it should be out like June, September."
"21042860","21046400"," This is a hedge that like lasts for months, six months. "
"21047600","21049520"," It's not like a weekend thing or something like that."
"21049680","21050760"," You want to put some time on it."
"21052120","21054660"," Give yourself the opportunity to have those things print. "
"21058980","21060420"," And you're going to expect it right?"
"21060620","21065580"," You're going to expect sellers into FOMC panic selling into this FOMC."
"21065600","21067700"," That's what my thought process here is over the weekend."
"21068240","21069960"," You're going to see shit being thrown everywhere. "
"21070320","21071020"," Bear shit everywhere."
"21072020","21076680"," It's going to be like beers have been just like stacking shit and buckets and they're waiting to"
"21076680","21078880"," just throw it on the walls all weekend."
"21079080","21079920"," That's what they're going to do to you. "
"21080960","21085260"," You know, I would get yourself positioned and I would turn social media off this weekend."
"21086400","21087220"," Turn it off."
"21091520","21094540"," Seriously, they just turn it off because you're going to hear it all this weekend. "
"21095200","21099300"," I mean, people are going to be writing like books about this shit over the weekend."
"21099900","21104940"," You're going to see like bear poetry on the wall and you're going to see bear like poems and fables"
"21104940","21111280"," and you'll have people out there writing like the Boy Who like a brand new testament, the brand new"
"21111280","21111920"," bear testament."
"21112920","21114220"," You're going to hear it over the weekend. "
"21114520","21117160"," I assure you that the weekly charts look like crap."
"21117560","21118900"," They just look they look horrible."
"21120760","21123900"," If you're a bull, the weekly charts, man, they just look bad. "
"21124160","21125220"," They just don't look good."
"21128420","21129700"," And I'm a bull."
"21130980","21135780"," You know, you want some healthy looking charts when you want to take along and the spy charts are"
"21135780","21137000"," just not looking good. "
"21141160","21144540"," It's looking out to the early marks on closing balance, currently sitting at 345."
"21145280","21148800"," The new bear testament."
"21149140","21149500"," Oh, yeah. "
"21150360","21153460"," The third coming of the of bear Jesus or something."
"21157100","21161020"," It's hard here to it's really hard here to be bullish."
"21163080","21163780"," It's not a market. "
"21163920","21164840"," It's not a stock thing."
"21165020","21166160"," It's the entire it's the economy."
"21166420","21167200"," It's the macro shit. "
"21167200","21170480"," It's it's all this other underlying shit."
"21170640","21173200"," The mechanics of the market are just not looking good."
"21173460","21175860"," You shouldn't see oil sell off the way that it did. "
"21176240","21181800"," You shouldn't see all this money inside of utilities and inside of tech."
"21182260","21185780"," You shouldn't see like H Y G not going up right now into a closing."
"21185780","21189780"," All these things, you're just like you're watching gold go straight up, right?"
"21190740","21193600"," So when you see this stuff, it's just it's just it's screaming at you. "
"21193600","21198920"," It's yelling at you and saying, hey, hey, we're at risk of a crash here."
"21199180","21200140"," That's what it's telling you."
"21201060","21203960"," I don't know how more public they could make it look. "
"21204820","21206980"," I don't know how more."
"21207440","21213680"," I don't know how they I don't know how they can telegraph to you more clearly without Jerome coming"
"21213680","21216180"," out and saying, we want a market crash."
"21219720","21222040"," Or at least like a bloodletting or something. "
"21225000","21228460"," Someone knows and they're telegraphing it to you."
"21231060","21233380"," Do you disagree with that in any way?"
"21236670","21238110"," Yeah, I saw the uninversion."
"21239090","21241110"," You know, I saw the uninversion. "
"21243550","21245390"," Inflation is the elephant in the room."
"21245750","21246030"," Absolutely."
"21247450","21248850"," I hope that they do. "
"21249070","21252410"," I'll be honest with you as like and not my stock market hat."
"21252410","21255950"," My main street hat, they got to be honest with you."
"21256110","21259270"," I'm hoping and praying that they can tame inflation. "
"21259650","21260150"," They have to."
"21260410","21261650"," It's it doesn't end well."
"21262150","21263950"," It doesn't end well. "
"21264150","21264770"," You know what it ends in?"
"21265510","21267310"," It ends in like a world war or some shit."
"21268610","21269490"," It doesn't end well."
"21275630","21279050"," Then like my main street hat is like fight inflation as best you can. "
"21279490","21280310"," Just do it."
"21280870","21285210"," 50 BPS, ram it home, maybe do one or two more."
"21285730","21288610"," 25s, pause it, break some more shit. "
"21289790","21291930"," You have to commit to this as the fed."
"21292130","21292590"," You have to."
"21292850","21294850"," And when they don't commit to it, it's not good. "
"21296310","21297690"," It ends badly."
"21303450","21305350"," Maybe stop and pump it in video stock."
"21305930","21306570"," It's not us. "
"21306750","21307550"," It's banks doing it."
"21307610","21308370"," They're all hiding in it."
"21309070","21309930"," It's not us. "
"21314030","21315250"," You can see it, right?"
"21315530","21317670"," I think banks don't care if those stocks come down."
"21318490","21320990"," They don't care because they ripped them so high at this point."
"21321290","21322810"," They're not going to crash any lower. "
"21326140","21328360"," They're prepared for a crash right now."
"21332000","21336960"," Yeah, uncontrolled inflation always does end in social unrest and more, absolutely."
"21342300","21345240"," The wealth effect of pumping shit goes in crypto. "
"21350080","21351700"," Look at TLT, man."
"21352200","21367610"," Put back spreads."
"21367850","21368730"," They give them the ratio spreads. "
"21368970","21370770"," You can actually make the ratio like three to two."
"21371490","21372890"," You can do it two to one."
"21372890","21378350"," Basically, you're selling a put and you're buying two puts at lower strikes. "
"21381230","21382470"," You sell it in the money put."
"21383710","21387770"," You buy two lower priced puts and you put them out in time."
"21389430","21392910"," If the market goes up, you can actually manage that trade. "
"21393690","21395890"," The market starts to confirm that we're going to go higher and higher."
"21396150","21398570"," You can just cut the put side loose, hold on to the sold put."
"21399730","21404850"," The sold put will end up paying for the price, the cost of that trade. "
"21405590","21411270"," So you'll break even or come out sometimes like five to 10% win, depending on how you manage it."
"21411630","21418110"," If the market does crash, the bought puts that you had will end up paying you handsomely."
"21418250","21418770"," It's like big money. "
"21426220","21431920"," Chase is saying, Hitler invades Poland because the Reich's bank was pumping shit goes."
"21432500","21433460"," We all know that."
"21434300","21434400"," Yeah. "
"21437720","21439840"," Kind of, huh, kind of in a way."
"21441200","21442240"," That was happening."
"21442460","21446400"," I actually know a lot about that history like the pre pre World War II history. "
"21447000","21449800"," That's what that's what Chase is talking about."
"21451860","21453060"," That's kind of true, Chase."
"21456960","21458420"," That is kind of true, my man. "
"21458420","21458580"," It's right."

"21566550","21570430"," You might see me live streaming at different times of the day or night."
"21572790","21574990"," You could see that if that does happen."
"21575070","21581790"," If we do get a crash, you might see me trading late night futures market and maybe maybe weird"
"21581790","21582670"," hours of the daytime. "
"21583350","21586390"," Like mornings and then afterclothes and stuff like that."
"21595330","21598210"," I posted on fin twit yesterday on my handle."
"21598390","21606330"," And if you just Google search me Captain Jim James, I reposted the structure of that play from the"
"21606330","21607550"," options industry council. "
"21607550","21609390"," They give a very simplified way."
"21609970","21614510"," One of the best examples or explanations to simplify the trade for you."
"21623230","21625110"," The guy walking around with the blue screen. "
"21647080","21648180"," Yeah, I see what you're saying."
"21653450","21654670"," Yeah, right out in Vesqua."
"21657210","21658850"," I might call you too in Vesqua. "
"21659130","21660610"," Maybe we'll have you on the show, man."
"21660790","21664070"," If we do the crash in Vesqua, do you want to do a co-show?"
"21665210","21666790"," You want to go on live together maybe?"
"21667190","21670970"," Or I'll send you an invite and you just come on and start talking."
"21671670","21672430"," You want to do that?"
"21677250","21678810"," Yeah, how about this in Vesqua?"
"21679030","21684950"," If we start, if we do, I'm not saying we're crashing, but if we do, I'll send you an invite"
"21684950","21687090"," in DM and we'll have you on the show, man. "
"21697430","21699570"," If you're watching right now, this is the end of the week."
"21699950","21707490"," If you want to help support the show, there's a little link down inside of the chat on Twitch and"
"21707490","21708610"," YouTube right now it says."
"21709690","21714310"," Captain's book recommendation this week is hedge fund market wizards, how winning traders win. "
"21714970","21715910"," There's a link for Amazon."
"21716630","21719290"," You can support the stream without any real money."
"21720030","21721770"," You can use Jeff Bezos' money. "
"21721930","21722750"," You click through that link."
"21722890","21729050"," It'll open up an Amazon page and it puts on a cookie for three days, not for a month, not"
"21729050","21730710"," for 90 days, just three days."
"21731230","21735350"," Any purchases that you make on Amazon, I'll get a small percentage of those purpose purchases. "
"21735830","21739490"," You're the price that you pay for goods and services on Amazon does not change."
"21740150","21741390"," You don't see any difference."
"21741650","21745850"," It's a matter of Amazon just giving me like three percent or something, one percent. "
"21746050","21746890"," I don't know how much it is."
"21746890","21747510"," It's very small."
"21748070","21752490"," It's a way for you to support the stream without even having to tip out of your own pocket or"
"21752490","21753570"," donate out of your own pocket. "
"21753770","21755370"," Then just go to the south side there."
"21755570","21758430"," So that's a 345 million to the south side at the moment."
"21758430","21763630"," If you are interested in supporting the stream, there's a link in the description of the YouTube"
"21763630","21771770"," channel, a direct link to a tip through PayPal, because I know that Streamlabs and YouTube and all"
"21771770","21773290"," these other companies, they want their cuts. "
"21775290","21778050"," So the most direct way is in the description of the videos."
"21783250","21784770"," Otherwise, I want you to have a great weekend."
"21785330","21788950"," I want you to know too, it's amateur weekend out there. "
"21789130","21791550"," I want you to know that the police have looked those two things, right?"
"21791550","21792430"," We talked about it this morning."
"21793870","21798990"," The amateurs go out and drink and like to fight on St. Patrick's Day."
"21799790","21803550"," You don't want to be fighting with amateurs on Friday night, right?"
"21803730","21806470"," If you're not going to fight with them the rest of the year, why fight with them this one night"
"21806470","21806830"," of the year?"
"21806990","21808450"," Stay away from the bars if you can. "
"21809990","21814210"," Second thing, the police, they're looking for drunk drivers."
"21814470","21815290"," Don't be drinking and driving."
"21816390","21821190"," And specifically tomorrow and Saturday morning, you might think that you're not drunk. "
"21822230","21825490"," And you start, you're like, I'm not going to drink, I'm not going to drink and drive on St."
"21825670","21826110"," Patrick's Day."
"21826170","21830110"," Then you wake up the next morning on Saturday and you go for a drive and you find out that"
"21830110","21831670"," you're still drunk and just don't know it."
"21832110","21834950"," The police are going to be looking for you on Saturday morning, right?"
"21835370","21836110"," Looking to pick you up. "
"21838230","21842310"," DUIs cost $20,000, $30,000, and they can take lives."
"21842570","21846530"," You can hurt somebody else out there and you don't want to hurt people, right?"
"21846750","21848470"," You're not out there to try to hurt people in real life."
"21848470","21850150"," So please don't do it this weekend. "
"21856320","21857460"," Please don't do it."
"21857520","21858320"," I'm begging you."
"21858960","21860120"," Don't get a DWI. "
"21860200","21861580"," Don't kill anybody on the road."
"21862540","21864080"," Don't get into a fist fight."
"21865240","21866380"," Be a professional. "
"21866660","21868020"," Be a human being."
"21870320","21872180"," If you're a guy out there, right?"
"21872520","21873400"," Girls don't like that."
"21873960","21879080"," If you're a guy out there, girls don't like seeing you out there making an ass out of yourself in"
"21879080","21880020"," a bar on a Friday night. "
"21880320","21882240"," They don't like seeing you out there drinking and driving."
"21884140","21887300"," Go do something else and you meet a woman that way."
"21887420","21889040"," I'm telling you it's going to be a better life for you. "
"21889840","21890720"," Don't do that stuff."
"21903290","21903690"," Nice."
"21903990","21904510"," Thanks, Avesqua. "
"21910390","21913250"," Well, I'm not saying this is the Irish."
"21913550","21914990"," I'm saying that this is everybody."
"21915530","21918850"," Like people want to be Irish on one day this year and it's not the day to be Irish. "
"21927460","21929420"," It's like the worst day of the year to be out there."
"21933170","21934970"," The Irish are born with two livers."
"21943240","21944620"," I'll hazy if you drink and drive. "
"21944800","21945720"," Yeah, it's not worth it, man."
"21945900","21946800"," Not worth drinking and driving."
"21948260","21949820"," There's not worth drinking and driving. "
"21950060","21952140"," There's no reason out there to drink and drive."
"21953400","21955880"," You got Uber, man."
"21956120","21959760"," You've got Uber and Lyft and you get all these easy ways to get an easy drive. "
"21960120","21963540"," If you're a good looking person, you probably can get picked up and driven by somebody else."
"21964280","21966320"," If you want your friends to try to drive, hide their keys."
"21967160","21968160"," I just don't let it happen. "
"21974540","21976600"," Did AMD hit 100 today or not?"
"21983260","21986500"," Son of a, son of a, I can't even, want to swear."
"21987600","21990400"," I got, I know Winky's at home right now going, whoa."
"21993320","21995040"," Look at AMD try. "
"21995600","21997080"," Winky's like at home right now."
"21997080","21999080"," I bet going, come on 100."
"22001420","22003380"," Come on 100. "
"22007680","22009800"," You know, Winky is a diamond hander too."
"22010300","22011600"," Winky is a total diamond hair."
"22011720","22012060"," He doesn't sell. "
"22012400","22018140"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, the old gamer guys out there."
"22018420","22022860"," Be safe and thanks for a great week."
"22023420","22024960"," Cap watch has been played. "
"22024960","22026160"," Love you old gamer guy."
"22026900","22031140"," Now squeezing 390 45 48 390 43."
"22032060","22033740"," Can we squeeze into the clothes?"
"22034380","22039880"," Can we give bulls a chance to at least throw on a putback spread after not listening to captain all"
"22039880","22040440"," week long?"
"22040880","22041720"," Can we get it?"
"22041860","22046120"," The early mark from closing balance still sitting at 345 million to the south side. "
"22047040","22048500"," Yeah, drink at home, man."
"22048760","22049780"," You can drink at home."
"22049880","22051200"," Just don't go out and do it publicly. "
"22054930","22056710"," Just don't go out in public and do it."
"22060450","22061570"," All right, all right on, man."
"22062190","22063770"," We've got a CVA 43. "
"22064270","22064550"," Thank you."
"22064750","22067370"," Thank you to captain and all the people who make this channel happen."
"22067830","22068930"," It's very much appreciate it. "
"22068990","22071690"," Yeah, I want to spend a special thanks out to all the moderators, the admins."
"22073010","22076530"," The good trade that you know, the good traders are out there inside the discord."
"22076630","22078190"," I appreciate you being in there. "
"22078590","22084530"," I appreciate great traders that show up to this live stream and talk inside of the stream chat and"
"22084530","22085250"," lend insight."
"22085550","22087290"," So I want you guys to know that I'm grateful that you're here."
"22087790","22092490"," I want to know that all of you that are here, new traders, old traders, new followers, old"
"22092490","22093590"," followers, I'm grateful that you're here. "
"22093610","22095750"," Without you guys, I wouldn't be talking to nobody, right?"
"22096210","22100610"," You're talking out to the big skates face and sky with nobody to hear me."
"22107870","22109510"," Have a great weekend, everybody."
"22121830","22122930"," Victor, just subscribe. "
"22122930","22124830"," Eugene Park just super chatted."
"22125470","22126410"," Squeeze it, daddy."
"22127130","22133030"," Yeah, I'll see you all on Monday. "
"22133290","22135590"," If you guys are piling out of here, I want you to have a great weekend."
"22138570","22144210"," The FedWatch tool is saying roughly 88% chance of Fed hiking by 25 BPS."
"22144610","22145790"," That's what I think happens. "
"22146550","22152870"," Like if I had like the most probable outcome for Fed day, I think it's going to be, I think"
"22152870","22156530"," it's going to be bubble dine just said, have a great week cap."
"22157550","22159670"," Thanks for the wisdom."
"22160390","22161410"," Oh man, thank you. "
"22161630","22162230"," Appreciate that."
"22163290","22165130"," That's what I think is the most likely outcome."
"22165370","22171290"," I think the Fed is going to, my thought process here is the Fed's going to say, hey, look, we're"
"22171290","22172210"," going to support the banks. "
"22172450","22173350"," We're going to keep height and ranks."
"22173550","22180690"," I think that's the only path for them to, to continue on 25 BPS and more rate hikes in the"
"22180690","22183670"," future and backstop everything when it breaks."
"22184810","22185570"," As they break shit. "
"22189130","22192830"," I think they keep breaking shit and keep supporting where they need to."
"22193170","22194430"," That's the only way to fight inflation."
"22195190","22197170"," But I would love to see 50 BPS, man. "
"22197850","22199110"," I would love to see it."
"22203980","22206240"," Yeah, I've got some calls here too, and they're kind of dying."
"22207740","22209160"," I've got some end of day calls. "
"22211120","22212580"," I'm holding them right into the bell here."
"22219100","22221140"," Wolf for trade and saying happy weekend cap."
"22221140","22228640"," See a two G-dad gold, happy weekend cap, and everyone 25 BPS and hawkish tone. "

"22240900","22243900"," I think they just need to be like, look, we're going to back, or we already know, right?"
"22244040","22245960"," We know now they're going to backstop whatever they break. "
"22246480","22247700"," General live coverage continuing."
"22248020","22252180"," As the Wall Street Journal says, that dozens of banks may have risks similar to SVB."

"22298300","22300980"," We have popped this out on the financial juice feed for anybody that's interested."
"22301980","22307860"," Financial juice Twitter feed is saying, or on their Twitter feed, they're saying that 186 banks are"
"22307860","22308860"," at risk right now."
"22310040","22310660"," 186. "
"22311900","22315080"," You remember just last week they said, what did they say last week?"

"22513800","22515040"," I think they need to do the fit. "
"22515140","22515580"," Well, I don't know."
"22515660","22516360"," They don't need to."
"22516880","22521620"," If they stay up, what they could do this, that's probably the cleanest thing they could do would"
"22521620","22521800"," be. "
"22522360","22526940"," Just keep doing the 25 BPS every quarter until they match inflation."
"22528460","22533680"," The 50 BPS would be would be if the 50 BPS is if they know they can't continue to raise"
"22533680","22534000"," rates."
"22534000","22538140"," If they know something we don't know and they just want that one last plunge. "
"22539800","22541580"," Well, that's how you'll get the 50 BPS."
"22541960","22544500"," If they know they can't keep raising every every quarter."
"22549260","22550260"," Seven minutes left. "
"22550600","22551600"," Have a great weekend, everybody."

"22555910","22556790"," I love pasto, man. "
"22559250","22559690"," Yeah."
"22559790","22563630"," Nick Temeros saying that the rate hikes depending where the markets are at by FMC."
"22564150","22568050"," They're expecting a crash between now and Wednesday or something, maybe. "
"22577060","22579500"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Chase."
"22580440","22582040"," They need to tell the bond market that."
"22584380","22592080"," Do you think they still have to act hawkish?"
"22592360","22597820"," No, I think that I think the safest thing for them to do is to say, look, we're just going"
"22597820","22598720"," to continue on our path. "
"22599480","22600240"," Nothing's changed."
"22601960","22604040"," And we're monitoring the banking crisis."
"22605760","22608760"," IE, we're going to support the banks as we continue to do our job. "
"22609940","22611940"," I think that's the most rational thing to do."
"22612980","22618420"," Now, if they know that they can't raise rates, rates again in the future, they can probably do a 50"
"22618420","22623360"," BPS, smash the market down nice and heavy, and that'll have the same effect."
"22628510","22630730"," Happy St. Patty's Day, Snucks Anonymous. "
"22645050","22646070"," What are you saying here?"
"22646430","22647270"," Or did I get it backwards?"
"22647830","22650930"," Felling because they think they're going to stop rate hikes."
"22651190","22653210"," Hold on, Holy Kristin, what are you saying here?"
"22657020","22658860"," I missed something with, what did you say there?"
"22659140","22661240"," Check Paypal too, best I can do for now, thanks."
"22662240","22666440"," Dude, Dad, Holy Kristin, man, you don't have to do anything for me, brother, I appreciate it. "
"22667460","22671280"," I'm going to get some pizza for the girls, and I'll take some pictures."
"22677220","22680920"," Are falling because they think they're going to stop rate hikes."
"22681140","22681540"," Yeah, they do. "
"22682900","22685220"," So the bond market thinks that we're not going to raise rates."
"22685480","22686240"," We're done raising rates."
"22686640","22691880"," So what they're saying, what the bond market is saying is, we've broken more than you see. "
"22692180","22695580"," They're telling the public, hey, the Fed has broken more than you've seen."
"22695720","22698100"," There's more damage done than you can see publicly right now."
"22698600","22703940"," You just saw financial Jews say that contagion actually has infected 186 banks. "
"22704740","22707840"," So maybe news hasn't broke of how much damage they've actually done."
"22708360","22710280"," Now, this is a two-sided thing."
"22710880","22717340"," If the Fed has broken shit badly, they're supposed to be supportive of markets. "
"22718280","22719700"," They have dual mandate kind of a thing."
"22719980","22721700"," They're supposed to fight inflation as well, right?"
"22721880","22728560"," So what they need to do is kind of say, hey, look, we need to still fight inflation, but we"
"22728560","22729560"," know our breaking shits."
"22729660","22730800"," We're going to hold those things up. "
"22731820","22737380"," Now, if they find out that they can't continue to raise rates, that's possible that they'll try to"
"22737380","22740220"," slam the markets once, like one last shock."
"22740840","22744100"," Now, the bond market's telling saying, hey, no, they can't raise rates anymore."
"22744940","22745220"," Right?"
"22745480","22746260"," That's the key here. "
"22746260","22752040"," The bond market's saying more shit's broken than you can see publicly, and their rate path is not"
"22752040","22753580"," going to continue."
"22763660","22765960"," I think TLT is going to rip-face at some point."
"22766180","22768520"," When the market rolls over, you're going to see TLT go to the moon. "
"22770100","22771940"," It's going to go to the fucking moon."
"22782460","22783080"," Hold on."
"22783440","22785560"," Zihoe Krasana is saying, TLT falling. "
"22786080","22788820"," I think Monday trades, the tight range, boring day, Tuesday dumps."
"22790220","22791640"," Make sure to make another poll."
"22792640","22793680"," We'll grab our popcorn. "
"22794280","22795800"," Have a good weekend trading, folks."

"22846540","22847680"," Let me see if I can..."
"22848400","22849980"," I'm just going to lie to post links here. "
"22850000","22850600"," I don't know if I can."

"22866680","22866900"," Nope. "
"22867120","22867700"," No, no, no."
"22868140","22870160"," I don't know what I'm doing on Twitch yet, brother."
"22876700","22879920"," Zihoe, can you tag me with that on Twitter?"
"22881960","22883240"," Tag me with that link on Twitter. "
"22887780","22888180"," Thanks."
"22888320","22889120"," I appreciate it."
"22902090","22903270"," Yeah, it's an engineered crash. "
"22903570","22904190"," I agree with that too."
"22909150","22912690"," David's making a note that we're closing directly on the 200 DMA."
