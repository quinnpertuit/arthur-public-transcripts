"63440","64640"," Good morning out there."
"64880","65740"," Hope you got me out of here."
"65740","67240"," It was time to take you out of here. "
"67760","70260"," Looks like everything is coming in."
"99700","102040"," Alright, let's just get right into it."
"104520","105500"," Good morning everybody. "
"105980","106220"," Welcome back."
"106220","108700"," End of quarter, June 30th."
"109000","110780"," One more day until the 4th of July weekend. "
"111820","115060"," We're going to switch it right over to the live stream here so you guys can see what's going on."
"115640","116040"," I haven't checked."
"116260","119900"," I haven't looked at the chat, but good morning to all of you out there right now. "
"121020","123520"," So we're going to take a quick look."
"123680","125880"," So this morning's numbers weren't that bad."
"126100","130039"," They weren't overall bad, but of course we have other things to be looking at. "
"130160","131560"," We'll take a look at that stuff today as well."
"132660","133660"," We talked yesterday."
"134020","136440"," Well, let's go through a few things here. "
"137560","142500"," So we talked yesterday about, well, in the morning, I think morning of the day before I posted"
"142500","147360"," about back here."
"147460","148280"," Let's look back here."
"148940","154880"," This drop that we had on Tuesday here and how unnatural this drop was, right?"
"155580","156900"," Based upon no news. "
"157080","159520"," We have the same thing happening happening again this morning."
"160180","161040"," That happens."
"161240","161560"," Alpha. "
"161940","162920"," I posted."
"163340","165240"," I made a post on last Sunday."
"166760","168340"," About where we should be headed. "
"168340","172380"," Well, this rally will fail, which of course it did right."
"172540","173700"," We had a failure of that rally."
"174960","176980"," And then also yesterday more. "
"177140","177900"," I think it was just a morning."
"178320","179480"," I'm not sure when I posted it."
"179540","180320"," Maybe it was on Tuesday. "
"181000","184360"," But I'm at least on Monday of days that we should see three 72."
"184640","187520"," I thought we'd see it yesterday and we hadn't."
"187900","193240"," And then yesterday I talked about how whenever we have these failures watch my cursor over here. "
"193980","199840"," I made a long post where I showed on the charts going back January that once we have this drop"
"199840","202900"," here that we continue to drop thereafter."
"203560","205040"," It's just a matter of time."
"205300","206320"," So that's on that captain's office. "
"206340","208080"," You can check out these posts."
"208360","211000"," It's the last two posts that I've made on that captain's office."
"211000","213660"," I made one last Sunday and then one again this week. "
"214620","220680"," And how this is not really truly news driven and not only that, but this morning is not truly news"
"220680","221460"," driven either."
"221740","222800"," Believe it or not."
"223600","224920"," This is not news driven. "
"225060","226040"," This is a bear market rally."
"226240","226840"," We had back here."
"227100","229640"," You can see the failure post of course. "
"230200","231540"," And where do we go from here?"
"231540","238980"," Now yesterday I did buy at the end of yesterday about some two dates for Friday January 1st 390s"
"238980","239340"," I'm holding."
"240060","246400"," And I've got a bunch of calls for July for dated farther away like the 15th and stuff like that."
"246760","251200"," But even so with those calls they're dirt cheap 60 cents or so that I have not sold those if"
"251200","251540"," you're asking. "
"252180","256779"," But even so with that we talked about how it's just a matter of time that we continue to go"
"256779","257240"," down here."
"257240","260200"," Now there's a couple key things I want you to be looking at today."
"260339","262120"," First is this previous slow. "
"262260","263880"," We discussed this previous slow yesterday."
"264480","266860"," We'll take a look back and see where it is."
"268040","272600"," And it was right in here on the 23rd so we can actually see we can get that. "
"273840","275600"," This is your first one right here right."
"275760","277440"," You can see we're now touching this previous slow."
"277940","280280"," We've got another one down below here at 368. "
"281260","281260"," 365."
"282320","284900"," We'll look at the book map and show you where the levels are down here."
"284900","287000"," The levels there kind of fucked up. "
"287580","292080"," There's a lot of just a volatility zone."
"292500","297580"," This whole area down here is going to be a grind to get through where it was like cutting through"
"297580","298140"," butter here."
"298460","300080"," There's a lot of stuff to get through. "
"300180","301800"," This is so messy today."
"302620","306740"," Now we also have this previous low back here to test at 36230."
"307240","309580"," We know the JPM callers down there as well. "
"310180","314580"," And believe it or not even below that is the 200 weekly moving average."
"314580","316920"," That we've been harping on as well right."
"317060","318200"," That we have a date with it eventually. "
"318700","319700"," It will eventually come."
"320120","321380"," So there's a lot going on here."
"321700","322960"," The other thing to expect. "
"323780","325720"," Let's come back to this channel we talked about yesterday."
"326180","331400"," Even within this channel we said hey we can easily sell off down here this morning."
"331960","333260"," And of course we did in the overnight. "
"333260","335580"," We continue to off the bell."
"336120","342200"," Now yesterday we were looking at, we're going to look today even more closely today as it's in the"
"342200","347260"," quarter because some pretty big bets are already coming in at the start of today."
"348460","353440"," Some of this involves Tesla heading into the next quarter. "
"354600","360120"," But specifically in here, specifically in here yesterday we talked about, I think come down here"
"360120","360480"," today."
"361000","365860"," This morning that it was entirely possible to just continue trading down inside of this channel."
"365860","367940"," And that's exactly what we did. "
"368600","372320"," And furthermore, the selling of the selling that's continuing now."
"373640","376540"," Actually it is planned to an extent."
"377340","382120"," So we've already talked at Nausea about that 200 at WMA. "
"382600","383580"," You want to see that."
"384020","387400"," We're going to talk about once more this morning because we've been harping on this for a couple"
"387400","387960"," weeks now."
"387960","394980"," And I don't think people get the point that when you're down here historically you want that check"
"394980","395700"," in that test. "
"396280","399080"," That ultimately you want to see that check down there."
"399640","402240"," Especially and it's a process that takes months."
"402540","404780"," Sometimes it doesn't take months if you want to fit through it. "
"404880","414660"," You want to see that check in either a break of it, a check bounce off, a second"
"414660","414940"," check."
"414940","419120"," And maybe even a third check we've seen in previous decades where we've seen previous checks."

"428320","429940"," We're going to pause this."
"430460","432880"," So we have a date with this."
"433520","437440"," It's important that we get this date with the weekly moving average. "
"438080","443340"," It confirms if you just had six months of relentless selling, right?"
"443340","446840"," You want to know how bad the market is."
"446900","450400"," You want to know if we break below the week the 200-week moving average."
"450900","456340"," If you can look forward to another three to six months or even possibly longer enough severe"
"456340","457440"," selling in the market. "
"458600","461400"," So you want to see that we are heading lower."
"461700","463280"," There is another aspect to this market."
"463280","465200"," I'd like to read through the refrigerator piece. "
"465420","466920"," I've got a second to turn this."
"467060","468460"," I'll revise downward to neutral."
"468460","476840"," Okay, so the other thing that you want to be considering as we're down here is what came in"
"476840","477120"," yesterday. "
"477640","482640"," Yesterday while we were trading, we noted two huge trades that were coming in yesterday."
"483580","487180"," One was Apple puts with aggressiveness, right?"
"487640","488940"," It broken up trying to be hidden."
"489500","495580"," We saw lots of Apple puts coming in for July 15th and it culminated in around two or three million"
"495580","496080"," dollars. "
"496080","499680"," Now it was hidden as it came in, but of course we saw it."
"500420","505720"," As that trade came in yesterday and then we saw the gold trade down to 165p."
"506740","514520"," We were discussing yesterday, if you see a hedge for millions of dollars in puts or calls that are"
"514520","516659"," a month out, three months out, something like that. "
"518120","519000"," It's a lot different."
"519260","520039"," These are all bought to buy."
"520480","521240"," These aren't sells. "
"521980","523560"," All this flow is at the buy."
"523560","530100"," When you see this stuff come into the market at such short day with such aggressiveness, it's pre "
"530100","530500","-planned."
"531420","534000"," It has nothing to do with what the numbers are going to be today. "
"534680","535240"," It's nothing."
"535540","537300"," You can see that in the numbers that came out today."
"537900","543180"," The selling in this market, especially after that rollover, they can say whatever they want. "
"543640","548700"," The funny part is this morning I was putting in some security lights, some exterior security lights"
"548700","549100"," in my house."
"549100","551960"," It turned on CNBC."
"552400","556960"," I don't watch it too often anymore, but it was just pure fucking cancer because you're losing a"
"556960","559960"," reason for why the market goes down. "
"561160","565280"," They always have to use an economic calendar and stuff like that to show that stuff."
"565760","572940"," When we know that yesterday that large banks were already planning on this drop off today, we saw"
"572940","573940"," it in gold yesterday."
"573940","575900"," We actually looked at the gold chart when it came in. "
"576000","581240"," We highlighted and noted the Apple puts that came in that were as aggressive as well."
"581400","586820"," There was no need or reason or anything that came out yesterday that said, Hey, you should be"
"586820","588380"," placing these trades right now."
"588740","593760"," That's because we're heading down into this lower trading range at the end of quarter for"
"593760","594480"," repositioning. "
"595480","600220"," The other thing to comment upon is the JPM collar trade that's out there."
"600220","602780"," I believe it's down at 36250."
"603300","604480"," It could be wrong on that. "
"604760","605860"," It might not be exact."
"606100","611040"," There's a couple of other numbers out there, but we're actually also trading down into that zone"
"611040","615800"," once again, and that implies that they're long those puts into end of quarter."
"616500","619540"," That's part of the Wag the Dog aspect to this market. "
"620120","628680"," I reposted this morning early on Twitter, an article that came out on the NASDAQ.com, or .org site"
"628680","629420"," a while."
"629580","633580"," I think this is sometime last September or October, but they actually went back into that article."
"633580","638960"," The key part of that article was they went back into that article and edited it to reflect that. "
"639360","646620"," A lot of flack was given about that JPM collar because it is a Wag the Dog type scenario where,"
"646920","653640"," regardless of where you think the market is going, that the market to an extent is pre-planned on"
"653640","654520"," where it's going."
"655280","660760"," It's off-handedly said, well, if you place a $1 billion bet, it should go where you want it to"
"660760","660880"," go."
"661000","665040"," That's just not what it theoretically would not what the market is supposed to do. "
"665660","673220"," Of course, that is what happens in this market, is that the Dog is wagged by these large banks."
"674380","680240"," The key point of posting that early this morning, too, was that I figured that the numbers would be"
"680240","683200"," somewhat better this morning, and they weren't bad."
"683820","687060"," We still sold off after the bell this morning. "
"687680","690660"," The implication is that it doesn't matter."
"690740","692000"," It doesn't matter what the numbers are."
"692100","694800"," They'll spend them anyway if they want to, to put the price. "
"695160","697760"," Now, if there was this huge, follow my cursor."
"698020","701480"," If you see this huge reaction today, it's really blasted off today."
"702020","705320"," It still would have came back down to print that collar. "
"705860","706760"," That's often the case."
"707060","710700"," A couple of years ago, it was a TikTok."
"710700","717000"," I was trading and I had CNBC on shockingly in the background. "
"717800","724720"," And a reporter was speaking to one of the hosts and let it slip that there could be a TikTok"
"724720","725280"," Google deal."
"727080","731740"," And at that time, they all knew, CNBC all knew about this."
"732140","735660"," And the host said, oh, we haven't released that information yet or something. "
"735840","737360"," And they kind of choked on it as it happened."
"737360","743740"," And I brought up Google real quick and Google stock shot to the fucking moon."
"744820","747260"," The crazy part was that it came right back down again. "
"747400","753240"," So anytime you've got large banks that are positioned a certain way, and even if there is a shock"
"753240","758460"," to the market any direction, whether it's up or down from where they're positioned, you're always"
"758460","764460"," going to see it come back, revert back to where they want that move to be."
"764460","769260"," And you're seeing that this morning fascinating because I posted that before the numbers came out"
"769260","772860"," this morning because I knew that even if those numbers were good, it did not matter."
"773240","776120"," It was no matter where they were going to come. "
"776440","778680"," Wouldn't have mattered if they were, you know, blow the doors off."
"779260","783680"," But like barn door number numbers and we came blasting up here, we still would have eventually came"
"783680","785880"," back down to where they want this market to be."
"786000","788700"," So be aware of that as a trader, be aware of that as an investor. "
"789720","793660"," That there is an aspect to this market that you don't have control over."
"793660","797920"," That you can only try to parse together and try to say, oh, we have a chance of this happening."
"798540","800000"," I'm going to chance of that happening. "
"800340","802120"," And you can see that play out this morning."
"802820","804920"," And we saw it play out yesterday."
"805440","809560"," They kind of wanted to make this post last night, but I didn't. "
"809640","814800"," I should have is that sometimes through options flow, not always, because you have real money"
"814800","822100"," buying, real money selling, but options flow can sometimes not only drive the market, but can also"
"822100","822780"," be a tell."
"823140","828420"," Like if you're sitting at a poker table, you can sometimes parse together what the markets going to"
"828420","831220"," do from options flow before it happens."
"831680","837100"," And even before news drops or news is used as a vehicle to convey. "
"837800","839000"," This is why the markets drops."
"839260","843680"," Now, if the numbers had come out this morning on PC horrible, they would have said that we're"
"843680","846300"," selling off right now because of horrible PC numbers."
"847620","850620"," So I guess I wanted to make sure you guys are all following along with that. "
"850980","855120"," Now, we're going to talk about, because then the corner, we're going to talk about some of the flow"
"855120","856300"," that's coming through this morning."
"856920","860580"," And you can actually see this last one down here, right?"
"861340","862660"," This is July 8th."
"865360","866800"," Hold on, we'll scroll back up here. "
"868580","870060"," So then scroll back down here."
"870400","871820"," You can see this one down here, right?"
"872080","876860"," It's July 15th, 670p for $1.8 million."
"877620","878980"," That's a huge bet. "
"879920","885060"," Unusual even for an end of quarter to have a July 15th, 15 days from now."
"885480","887160"," Such a low bet on the market."
"887340","888320"," These are not sell orders. "
"889060","893880"," I know some of the flow services out there, which is through a pile of garbage on the table."
"894620","902700"," The flow ago uses specific indicators as to the specific quant analysis to make sure they're giving"
"902700","902980"," you."
"902980","908200"," These are buying for a print down the road options flow. "
"908320","910800"," So let's take a look closer at the options flow as it comes in today."
"911900","917760"," The last thing to talk to you about is to expect wild swings in the market, say it being the"
"917760","918320"," 30th."
"918460","922120"," That's pretty much why this fucking chart looks so nasty pairs. "
"922340","924140"," There's so many levels that we can trade to."
"924720","930620"," Now, we're going to look closer on the book map this morning and just show you some of the levels"
"930620","931180"," down below."
"931180","932920"," And we're going to hold on a second. "
"933180","934700"," We'll get all this stuff up right together here."
"935960","938120"," You can see above here, 375, right?"
"938320","940460"," This should be S1 this morning."
"940460","942360"," And we have broken below S1. "
"942460","949180"," You want to see S1 get reclaimed here from this 372.56. We touched that previous low you can see"
"949180","949480"," here."
"949700","953620"," You want to see an attack back a get back up high to 375 more."
"953720","954400"," We currently are. "
"954600","959320"," So you can see this 37 to 250 was some support, some latering down below."
"959320","963020"," This support is that that recheck of that previous low."
"963320","966600"," We talked about that yesterday, then down below that we've got 370. "
"968740","970200"," 365 down below here."
"970320","975820"," A little bump here and then 363 and then in reality, 360 down below here."
"976400","981360"," Let's take a look down look one more time on this other chart over here and just show those levels. "
"982080","985500"," We can see the collars down here at 362."
"986320","988440"," We can see 365 here."
"988780","992000"," I doubt we get to this 200MA, WMA this week. "
"992300","997520"," I think it's closer to the end of earnings season that will trail off just like Q1."
"997700","1002480"," You'll see that pump and then you'll see that trail off into as the majors."
"1002840","1007020"," The big as big tech and all these other companies are made to walk blank just like they were back"
"1007020","1007360"," in. "
"1007900","1009620"," Just like they were back in Q1."
"1009800","1013320"," The other thing to remember too in this idea is that."
"1014540","1021520"," Regardless of the 200 a week moving average, I think it's that 350 to right now or 350. "
"1022080","1027339"," It should still continue to climb until it matches up with wherever we are in the market if we"
"1027339","1028180"," continue to go down."
"1028440","1034180"," So this date is kind of manifest destiny unless we have some Ukraine news or you've got the Fed"
"1034180","1034520"," put."
"1035540","1042020"," That's what a bull is looking for is for that 200 weekly moving average as a test. "
"1042020","1049340"," I think that strike down below here on Tesla is like 600 or it was a week or two ago."
"1049480","1050400"," I don't know where it is right now."
"1050420","1051120"," I have to go back and look. "
"1052540","1056800"," Now other than that, we're going to take a look at options flow for the moment."
"1057100","1059800"," We're going to bring this one up or we're going to bring that one up real quick."
"1060340","1063740"," We're going to look at some if you can see the flow sentiment is bearish this morning. "
"1064520","1066840"," That's because of all the hedging that's coming into the market."
"1067300","1068660"," I want you to see Tesla here."
"1069140","1070700"," That's pretty severe right there. "
"1070700","1073920"," Six seventy P seven fifteen."
"1074760","1079720"," My assumption is that they're expecting a lot less than six seventy for Tesla."
"1080160","1082720"," They're going to be expecting somewhere around that six hundred tests. "
"1083120","1084120"," Six twenty tests."
"1084520","1085460"," And that's quite soon."
"1085460","1085720"," Right. "
"1085860","1090060"," This is implying that Tesla is going to sell off into their earning season as well."
"1090760","1093720"," We're going to look at some other highlights this morning as well."
"1094640","1095460"," We've got that Tesla. "
"1095460","1096780"," We've got this one here."
"1096940","1100960"," FXI nine sixteen twenty two two point one million dollars."
"1101180","1103780"," Spy seven eleven three sixty four. "
"1104080","1106920"," See six hundred ninety three thousand dollars."
"1107560","1110920"," But look at this other Tesla seven one six eighty P."
"1111260","1116460"," I'm assuming there's some spreads out there possibly as well for Tesla to close at a lower number."
"1116980","1117940"," We'll take a look. "
"1118120","1118820"," Keep looking down here."
"1119160","1121640"," We've got a one million dollar P A and W."
"1121640","1126360"," For January 20th twenty twenty twenty three three seventy P."
"1126880","1128280"," For one million dollars."
"1128640","1129900"," And then we've got a Q."
"1130100","1133720"," March 17th twenty three one hundred P."
"1134080","1135440"," Two point three million dollars. "
"1135460","1137300"," Actually, this would be a really good one for."
"1137560","1139000"," We'll talk about that one later this morning."
"1141360","1142760"," That's a good one to be talking about. "
"1144000","1150320"," But that's the reason that you think that we've got Amazon seven one six hundred thousand dollars."
"1150320","1156460"," And we've got a our CC eight nineteen twenty two for five hundred twenty nine thousand dollars."
"1156800","1159100"," What else of a note do we have so far. "
"1162020","1164080"," We're just squeeze through some of this stuff here."
"1164600","1167760"," And video one twenty twenty three one thirty P."
"1168120","1169760"," Seven hundred forty one thousand dollars."
"1170360","1171640"," And then NVIDIA as well. "
"1171980","1174840"," This is a seven one twenty two four hundred twenty."
"1175060","1175920"," That's not that big of a deal."
"1177280","1180120"," Let's keep scrolling through right off the open this morning. "
"1180280","1186140"," You saw weakness and you can see what came through eighteen million dollars for eight nineteen"
"1186140","1188980"," twenty two three fifty seven P."
"1189260","1192780"," That's pretty that's a pretty large trade against the spy."
"1193520","1194760"," Heading into August."
"1195300","1197180"," This is not that far along here. "
"1197280","1197440"," Right."
"1197860","1201460"," Nineteen million dollars against this market."
"1201880","1205820"," Heading into August nineteen and a low of the market. "
"1205820","1211680"," There can be some argument that this is a long only hedge fund forced into this contractually to"
"1211680","1213760"," buy these hat these hedges."
"1213960","1215820"," But in all really this is fine."
"1216000","1218160"," I guess this could possibly be. "
"1218840","1220820"," I don't have to check to see what this is later on."
"1220940","1223940"," But we're going to try to find that this isn't this is in the JPM car."
"1224100","1225540"," That is that comes on somewhere else. "
"1225540","1227560"," What else do we have here?"
"1227860","1228700"," That's not a big trade."
"1229220","1232380"," I'm trying to bounce back and forth on the numbers here."
"1232620","1232940"," That's it. "
"1233060","1233860"," That's all I've got so far."
"1234400","1235160"," But this one right here."
"1235300","1236500"," This spy one is pretty big. "
"1237000","1237840"," Nineteen million dollars."
"1238000","1240960"," That one hurts eight bucks eight forty four eight thirty nine."
"1241380","1242260"," These are huge. "
"1242660","1248840"," But this is twenty one thousand contracts right at a pretty steep price against the market."
"1251060","1251900"," That's pretty big."
"1254180","1255480"," To put that back there. "
"1256460","1258460"," Three seventy two fifty six of that previous low."
"1258840","1260640"," Let me know if you think we go up from here or not."
"1261040","1262560"," Let me push this back down here. "
"1263780","1266280"," Try to reclaim S one at three seventy five."
"1267420","1270240"," And I'm going to read to you next this morning."
"1270340","1272480"," I'm going to leave you guys to watching your screeners. "
"1272800","1273900"," I'll put the news back on."
"1273960","1277180"," I'm going to read to you a couple of things to go over today."
"1277700","1279220"," Oh, this morning for you. "
"1279380","1280360"," Just give me one second here."
"1287450","1288970"," Already recovering right now."
"1289010","1290730"," So we'll see if we get that recovery today. "
"1291130","1294870"," We'll put this on a one day chart where a one minute chart."
"1296710","1299710"," Nice beautiful bounce broke through this previous low."
"1299930","1302870"," Talked about this yesterday hitting this previous low here. "
"1303410","1304770"," Coming up on a VWAP right now."
"1304790","1306470"," We'll see if we can reclaim VWAP."
"1306730","1309390"," The price target above looks like three seventy five fourteen. "
"1309390","1312230"," So we'll lower this one down right here."
"1313190","1315110"," See if we can gain this three seventy five fourteen."
"1315650","1316550"," We'll look a little bit higher. "
"1318170","1321770"," So we'll get this a little bit three seventy five twenty one."
"1323810","1324770"," We're right there."
"1326730","1328950"," Above we've got three seventy five ninety three. "
"1329510","1332270"," And then all the way up into three seventy six seventy three."
"1333070","1335190"," We'll see if we see anything even higher here."
"1335190","1339670"," Three seventy eight fifty and three eighty one above from there. "
"1340010","1341610"," I don't think we've got much above here."
"1341630","1343190"," I don't think we're getting all the way up here anymore."
"1343250","1345890"," I think 390 might be up table unless it's end of the day. "
"1346310","1347270"," End of the day kind of a thing."
"1347370","1349010"," Three eighty eight and 390."
"1352390","1355250"," We'll keep our eyes on this one and this climb above here. "
"1355630","1358790"," See if we can break above this VWAP and hit that."
"1359210","1360430"," We're going to bring this over a little bit."
"1364850","1367210"," Let me highlight this a little better. "
"1375750","1376710"," Yeah, it's kind of disappear."
"1376930","1379070"," It looks like there's some resistance right now in VWAP."
"1379830","1381590"," And then a new target above right there. "
"1381690","1382430"," Three, there it is."
"1383410","1384210"," Let me just a second here."
"1389160","1390940"," And I'll check your comments in just a second. "
"1391140","1392680"," Good morning to all of you out there if you're just joining us."
"1393560","1397300"," If you want, you can always go back pause the program and check back."
"1400230","1403270"," If you are a new listener or a new watcher. "
"1404810","1406610"," We're starting to climb up here."
"1406730","1407730"," Three seventy five twenty four."
"1407810","1410390"," It looks like the resistance has moved slightly higher. "
"1411010","1411810"," Three seventy six."
"1412210","1415610"," So we'll put this next target above to three seventy six."
"1417090","1418750"," See if we can make it above there. "
"1428020","1429720"," Man, this like floating around."
"1438910","1441310"," Sellers all the way up to three seventy seven fifty."
"1443470","1445890"," We'll see if we can get up here and get that get that squeeze off. "
"1449470","1451210"," Check the portfolio here for a minute."
"1467860","1470600"," Thirty four two first."
"1479940","1482240"," Add some three eighty C's. "
"1488460","1489220"," All right."
"1491020","1491560"," Okay."
"1491920","1493180"," So hold on one second here. "
"1497030","1500090"," I'm going to read this note to you real quick here."
"1502870","1506390"," The resistance today shows at three eighty and three eighty five."
"1506990","1510390"," Support shows at three seven five zero then thirty seven hundred. "
"1510390","1515310"," There are a lot of large flows in the market say not just from the JPM role, but likely to"
"1515310","1519050"," from macro rebalancing due to quarter end."
"1519850","1524490"," We therefore see little directional edge today but continue to think that quarter end has opened"
"1524490","1527070"," the window to further downside into July."
"1527810","1531850"," Just take note that we saw those spy puts come into the market. "
"1531950","1533830"," Those Tesla puts come into the market this morning."
"1534550","1537290"," This is a function of put support rolling to lower strikes."
"1537890","1540150"," We look for the put wall thirty seven hundred. "
"1541050","1545530"," To be rolled lower as a key signal that more downside is ahead."
"1546310","1550550"," Our models estimate five to ten percent of S&P Delta"
"1550550","1558590"," expiring today, and expires today."
"1559070","1561650"," Well, this now I guess people are saying that they own it, right?"
"1561970","1562890"," We now know that they own it. "
"1563150","1564330"," Well, this is a large position."
"1564710","1570730"," It's a singular position and in total, this expiration pales in comparison to the June 17th OPEC."
"1571610","1577630"," You can see this in the plot below where we plot raw data for puts deal and calls for maybe"
"1577630","1583570"," six thirty the six thirty expiration is smaller than that of July 15th, which is regular Monday"
"1583570","1586750"," Monday expiration compared to the June OPECs. "
"1587110","1587990"," Hold on a second here."
"1588070","1589030"," I'm going to show you guys."
"1589290","1595410"," I'm going to show you this OPECs expiration. "
"1596250","1599690"," Just a second here."
"1606390","1611890"," Just a second here, I'm going to open this up."
"1613910","1616930"," This is the expiration that we're talking about here. "
"1617730","1620750"," You can see, I don't know if you can see my cursor over this."
"1620870","1621730"," My cursor looks kind of weird."
"1622470","1625450"," But you can see down here the column here. "
"1628040","1629420"," My eyes are all cocked sideways."
"1632220","1635680"," Right here is the first one here on the left side of your screen."
"1635880","1636860"," You'll see this expiration. "
"1637920","1639520"," This is the six thirty expiration."
"1640720","1645280"," You can actually see a larger expiration on seven fifteen and then nine sixteen."
"1646340","1647740"," These are the puts values. "
"1648060","1649080"," I don't know if you can see my cursor."
"1649380","1650360"," It's got like a little black dot."
"1650800","1652640"," I don't know if I'm going to do like a eraser or something. "
"1652820","1653880"," Right over here is the first one."
"1654220","1655200"," Here's the next one."
"1655700","1660380"," We've got nine sixteen and then twelve sixteen for puts. "
"1660980","1666180"," And you can see that the puts all the way to calls exponentially, especially even today as well."
"1666520","1668960"," So I'm going to rip into the clothes today in the thirtieth."
"1668960","1673580"," As these puts expire, we will see a nice fat rip into the clothes due to this expiry. "
"1674000","1677920"," So it's not going to be this huge Vanarelli that's going to go to the moon."
"1678680","1681300"," And it shouldn't carry over into the other."
"1681300","1683160"," There should be someone to the first tomorrow, but not. "
"1683300","1685400"," There's a little bit tomorrow, but not a ton."
"1688120","1693700"," Looking forward, the major downside area we continue to watch is the February 20th high, which is"
"1693700","1696160"," less than ten percent from here."
"1696660","1700240"," And interestingly, the new JPM strikes will likely be around this area. "
"1700820","1707360"," So this could place a mark, this could be a place to mark as important longer term support."
"1708220","1710460"," So we'll look at what's ten percent."
"1711500","1713940"," We'll take a look at what ten percent is from here. "
"1724530","1726750"," We'll actually check it on SPX real quick."
"1731120","1734060"," And funnily enough, I've got a, I actually have."
"1734060","1737900"," I actually have an SPX chart up right now. "
"1738740","1740240"," Let's see if we can move this down here."
"1744150","1748610"," So ten percent on SPX actually breaks."
"1751380","1757350"," It actually breaks that weekly moving average if we were to take another ten percent down from"
"1757350","1758690"," where we are currently. "
"1759430","1768150"," So that would infer that if into July or even this quarter, we trade lower than, we trade to the"
"1768150","1768910"," ten percent lower."
"1769030","1771290"," And that actually puts us down to this three-twelve down here, right?"
"1771410","1776510"," You can see this was three-twelve, two-eighty-five number that I was looking at."
"1776610","1781330"," Actually, let's go back to where that is. "
"1781550","1782370"," We can see right here."
"1783010","1787130"," We can see right where this big giant level of support is in the market."
"1787610","1794890"," You can see back here on January, January, who knows November, heading into January of 2020. "
"1796510","1797850"," This large area of support."
"1798550","1805370"," Now, if we do break below this level here, this is the conversation that we're having on that"
"1805370","1806390"," weekly moving average."
"1807090","1807590"," I think right here. "
"1809030","1813750"," If that weekly moving average comes across here, right, we eventually tag up with it."
"1815110","1821670"," And if we trade below this and we can't reclaim it, right?"
"1821670","1827810"," If we trade below two tests and we're off and running, if we can't do that, what you end up"
"1827810","1831090"," seeing is you end up seeing that break, right?"
"1831410","1835310"," And then we are in for a nasty ride heading into end of year."
"1835570","1838070"," This is where, this is what you really don't want to see it. "
"1838570","1842150"," As a bull, though, you definitely want to see that break below, right?"
"1842330","1844470"," The reclamation, and then this move higher."
"1844590","1847990"," You don't want to CO8 where we actually crashed back through."
"1847990","1853590"," I think it was O8 or O1 when we broke back above the weekly moving average, and it was a"
"1853590","1858450"," huge fake out, like two tests, and we actually ended up crashing the market. "
"1859350","1861870"," The last, there was O8, O1 that we had."
"1861990","1864490"," That one scenario happened, and the other one we just broke below."
"1864890","1869190"," Couple of tests, and we were off and running down lower into end of year. "
"1870270","1877970"," So consider this as we move forward into July for the rest of this quarter, as this is setting up."
"1879730","1881090"," Let me get rid of this here."
"1888430","1891850"," To the upside, 4,000, this is the positive news if you're a bull. "
"1892350","1899890"," To the upside, 4,000 is the major strike due to large open interest."
"1900350","1904850"," We believe that the market cannot hold a sustained rally without more clarity from the Fed, which"
"1904850","1905750"," we already know, right?"
"1905870","1911970"," We know we need clarity from the Fed, we need Ukraine, we need a test of the weekly moving average."
"1912770","1917930"," We need something out there to give the market a reason to have a sustained rally. "
"1918430","1920610"," We know we don't have that currently in this market."
"1921530","1926830"," So without more clarity from the Fed, which likely comes with a more definitive pause reduction in"
"1926830","1927150"," inflation."
"1927790","1931750"," With that, we want to see larger call positions added as puts are closed. "
"1932330","1934390"," Some things that our models have not seen of late."
"1934390","1940810"," We will therefore be looking at major Fed meetings plus expirations as areas to position for"
"1940810","1944350"," rallies, sick, sustained rallies."
"1944670","1946670"," One of these windows seems to be late July. "
"1947830","1954670"," So this last note is saying to you that if you're even looking, so as a bull, if you're even"
"1954670","1961630"," looking for any sort of form of sustained rally that you're only looking for either, those are a"
"1961630","1962660"," few things you're looking for."
"1962660","1968940"," You're either looking for a Fed meeting where that's scheduled, right?"
"1969060","1975200"," You're looking for a velocity as Wiki was saying yesterday of a crash, i.e. a crash where they"
"1975200","1979580"," would come out and a few days thereafter, they would come out and there would be a Senate hearing"
"1979580","1983300"," and they would reinstitute unlimited QE once again."
"1983780","1992640"," You're looking for Ukraine to end to stem shortage. "
"1998020","2002160"," You've only got a few things that you're looking for and the last thing you'd be looking for would"
"2002160","2004180"," be that test of the weekly moving average."
"2004620","2011560"," I can't think of any other headline news that makes a sustainable rally in this market."
"2012240","2013060"," You shouldn't either. "
"2014700","2021800"," We actually talked about that last weekend and the last post we made that it's the same regime now"

"2039580","2040380"," at some point."
"2043580","2044820"," All right, so all that's out of the way. "
"2044920","2046720"," We're going to get a lot of stuff out of the way this morning."

"2072270","2072949"," We'll take a look."

"2151900","2153280"," Let's see you guys are saying."
"2153520","2154780"," Let's see what you guys are saying on."
"2155660","2156220"," Yeah. "
"2156400","2157180"," I'm wrong here."
"2157180","2158620"," A keen F you want to know."

"2170180","2171400"," Good job on the SIG puts."
"2174080","2175820"," Kevin looked at Tesla yet this morning."
"2176860","2178180"," Let me take a look at Tesla real quick. "
"2187320","2189800"," Let's bring up the Tesla chart from yesterday."
"2191660","2194060"," We looked at a macro view on Tesla yesterday."
"2194260","2196780"," This was the price target if you were a Tesla bull. "
"2198160","2200560"," So for a place to actually buy right."
"2201780","2206720"," And where's that by zone it's below this six hundred area right we're looking for this test."
"2207720","2208620"," So they can. "
"2209240","2211000"," Just a little bit closer here."
"2219000","2220660"," And they've got these puts."
"2221660","2223180"," For mid July. "
"2225040","2227740"," That's six fifty so anything below here."
"2228440","2230140"," Right into July fifteen."
"2230720","2232440"," That's not too far away right. "
"2232660","2234220"," It's not too far away."
"2235460","2236440"," July fifteen."
"2237780","2239800"," Which is right where my box is right there. "
"2240600","2241120"," Shocker."
"2244020","2244540"," Shocker."
"2246280","2249460"," So they're looking for any kind of weakness from here into July. "
"2249940","2252380"," Now they could test a good have a great ER."
"2253100","2254260"," It's not really relevant right."
"2254480","2256620"," This is implying that there's going to be a sell down. "
"2257760","2259900"," Into their ER at some point."
"2260340","2262140"," They're betting upon this taking place."
"2262140","2264320"," Do I think that we're going to sell down into July. "
"2265800","2268000"," You know there's no there's never really a crystal ball."
"2268780","2270360"," But as a Tesla bull."
"2271760","2273960"," We made this box just box yesterday. "
"2274480","2277620"," To say hey set alerts down here for a buy on Tesla."
"2278000","2279720"," Over a longer period of time."
"2280720","2284140"," And if you're looking at Tesla why are we looking that far below. "
"2284560","2285920"," And there's a reason for it."
"2286000","2288220"," And it's because of all the support that we have here."
"2288540","2289680"," Now let's say we break. "
"2290220","2291420"," I don't know if you have any guts."
"2291640","2293460"," I don't know the long term traders know this but."
"2293860","2294600"," Or investors. "
"2296020","2298340"," Whenever you spent spend a time around an area."
"2298340","2299860"," If you're not a long term."
"2301680","2303880"," Trader investor somewhere in here. "
"2304320","2306400"," So you see that we spend time in zones like this."
"2306860","2308080"," It's hard to break through this stuff."
"2312080","2313880"," Is established support back here. "
"2315180","2319020"," But you can see that there's this pretty significant drop off down here."
"2321520","2324160"," Once we start to break through time."
"2324420","2325740"," So you have to be aware of this as well. "
"2326300","2327660"," You kind of want to see this get."
"2327900","2331160"," You want to see this get bought here and not start to break below."
"2332120","2335520"," Can we break below into lower numbers into September. "
"2336280","2339680"," It's going to all depend upon what's going to all depend upon."
"2340060","2341560"," This is being 100% honest."
"2342060","2343140"," It all depends upon. "
"2344560","2345520"," That weekly moving average."
"2346000","2347300"," If you guys start to see."
"2347980","2349020"," I'll be honest with you. "
"2349080","2349920"," Between now and July."
"2351180","2351940"," Possibly August."
"2352300","2353180"," If you start to see. "
"2353440","2355400"," I checked a week or two ago."
"2355880","2358220"," It was 600 was the weekly moving average."
"2358540","2360200"," So if that weekly moving average comes up here. "
"2361240","2364120"," I'll just pretend that this is it right here."
"2365600","2366040"," Right."
"2366640","2369280"," When it comes up here and you do start to see Tesla breakdown. "
"2370360","2372380"," It would be with the market breaking down."
"2372580","2374060"," And if you start to see stuff like this."
"2374760","2376380"," I want to warn you guys out there. "
"2376380","2379200"," If you're if I don't know how long of a market participant."
"2379200","2381080"," How long you've been participating in this market."
"2381340","2386560"," I don't know how long you've been in this market. "
"2386560","2387460"," But I'll tell you something."
"2388360","2391540"," I was in this market back in 0708."
"2392440","2393600"," Somewhere in there. "
"2393980","2395660"," And I'll tell you what when you."
"2397000","2398580"," When you break below this stuff."
"2399100","2401900"," And you start to confirm that we're heading lower. "
"2402620","2405420"," And you say to yourself there's no possible way that'll happen."
"2405420","2407380"," You know that it's happened to Amazon in the past."
"2408080","2411460"," You know very large companies have seen these moves. "
"2412080","2415260"," So if you do see if we do see something like this start to take place."
"2415780","2419040"," And you say well we'll never see this price on Tesla."
"2419760","2424300"," I can assure you that you start to see the Fed break things. "
"2424440","2425860"," They like to break things already know that."
"2426320","2427960"," That we do start to break stuff."
"2428860","2431280"," And you were making a joke yesterday that JPM. "
"2432800","2436460"," You'll find out that JPM actually owned or one of these large banks."
"2436800","2439020"," Actually owned a ton of Tesla because they put it into a."
"2439940","2442840"," A 401k or a planned or a fund or something because."
"2443260","2444440"," The past 10 years. "
"2444760","2446780"," Everyone wants Tesla and their fund right."
"2447160","2449560"," And they're in their 401ks or whatever."
"2449840","2450740"," And they're aggressive funds. "
"2451180","2452380"," So when you see stuff like this."
"2452840","2454620"," I want you to be aware of this as we move forward."
"2454880","2456100"," Into July and August. "
"2456100","2459480"," That if you start to see the S&P 500."
"2460720","2463540"," The NASDAQ the NDX start to break."
"2464600","2464820"," Really hard. "
"2464960","2466420"," This could be significant into."
"2467840","2469380"," End of year at least September."
"2469920","2470700"," Maybe even December. "
"2471360","2475280"," Even if we had like beautiful summary bounced off to 50 to 50."
"2475360","2478380"," But if we were to recheck it and then break below that 50."
"2479640","2480940"," It gets nasty. "
"2481700","2482240"," This is the net."
"2482440","2484320"," This is this is when you start to see."
"2485620","2487340"," You don't really see it here. "
"2487940","2489060"," You're not going to see it here."
"2489120","2492160"," You're not going to see like market devastation in here."
"2493220","2495760"," When you start to see real devastation right demand destruction. "
"2495780","2497340"," You start to see people lose their homes."
"2497900","2498760"," People lose their jobs."
"2499380","2501080"," People all that all that nasty shit right. "
"2501540","2502940"," Start to see like veil start."
"2503620","2505880"," Want middle class people coming to ski at their resort."
"2506500","2507420"," Stuff like that right. "
"2508060","2509920"," See high end places asking the pores to come."
"2511040","2514180"," What you're doing is this is what this is when this takes place."
"2514180","2515700"," So this is the baddie. "
"2516080","2517520"," This is the one to watch out for."
"2518200","2518600"," Okay."
"2519240","2521220"," So just be aware that as you trade for with Tesla. "
"2522340","2523340"," This seems logical."
"2524000","2524800"," The 650 puts."
"2525300","2528220"," I can't say that it's not a bad trade. "
"2528760","2531580"," I honestly can't say it's not a bad trade heading into."
"2532780","2534360"," I can't honestly say that."
"2535000","2537820"," If you're long a bunch of Tesla stock that you wouldn't take that hedge. "
"2538580","2539580"," You don't know how it's structured."
"2539840","2542700"," It could be structured in a ratio spread."
"2543160","2545000"," To protect just longs that they have. "
"2545040","2546660"," It might not just be straight puts either."
"2548340","2549780"," Does it look like the Tesla for you?"
"2552700","2553740"," No, no, no."
"2553780","2554680"," So let's be clear. "
"2555540","2559380"," So Ergo is saying that the Tesla 200 weekly moving averages."
"2559700","2561420"," 414 per trading view."
"2562000","2564080"," I want to be clear here to you if you're a Tesla bull. "
"2564620","2566080"," When you're trading Tesla."
"2566540","2568480"," Now, trust Tesla can trade in its own."
"2569360","2572840"," But when you're more commonly trades along with the market. "
"2573360","2574680"," That weekly moving average."
"2575420","2579500"," That I'm talking about is the market weekly moving average."
"2580120","2582840"," You want to be not not be comparing the price of Tesla. "
"2583580","2587340"," But the price of the weekly moving average for the stock market."
"2588040","2592500"," Because there are macro implications on individual tickers."
"2592860","2596080"," Regardless of how nice you like them. "
"2596080","2598340"," Or how great you think that they are."
"2598420","2599540"," That's an important point to make."
"2600040","2602140"," Because oftentimes you'll look at. "
"2603100","2604820"," In previous market."
"2605780","2607160"," Crashes right in."
"2607640","2611780"," Down and short term debt cycles like and I guess you could call. "
"2612220","2613380"," I don't know if you want to call."
"2613680","2616880"," Oh, oh, oh, oh one market crashes."
"2616880","2619000"," But when the market fails right. "
"2619320","2620560"," We have market failure."
"2622080","2623880"," You need to stop paying attention."
"2624700","2626900"," I think I've got Tesla pegged at. "
"2627460","2627580"," 360."
"2629080","2630420"," As a possible low."
"2630920","2632240"," If this market does go there. "
"2632340","2635920"," If the market breaks and holds and breaks below the weekly move."
"2636040","2636780"," The weekly moving average."
"2637380","2638760"," You would wind up seeing. "
"2639480","2641560"," I think ergo."
"2641920","2642960"," Said for 14."
"2643080","2644020"," I think I tagged it at 360. "
"2645280","2646320"," On my own charts."
"2646400","2647440"," Not the weekly moving average."
"2647580","2649740"," Or expect like the bloodbath to occur. "
"2651100","2653060"," But always especially when."
"2653200","2656240"," So I want to focus on this for a minute."
"2657700","2658980"," Start if you have. "
"2659120","2660560"," I posted this on Twitter a couple weeks ago."
"2661220","2663360"," If you if you if you haven't already."
"2663960","2668000"," You need to start looking at weekly charts monthly charts. "
"2668380","2670780"," Weekly moving averages monthly moving averages."
"2671300","2675740"," And start comparing them by years and decades believe it or not."
"2675740","2679580"," And start looking for lows in the market. "
"2680680","2684200"," Now it did even on that same note I still posted on."
"2684900","2686260"," Still posted on Twitter."
"2687340","2690320"," With that statement that this is still one of those places. "
"2690820","2693100"," You generally want to dollar cost average."
"2693540","2695580"," It's one of the places where I agree with Warren Buffett."
"2696280","2699400"," That if you had two or three places to buy this market. "
"2699860","2702940"," It's probably here close here to the weekly moving average."
"2703140","2704900"," There's one other spot below."
"2705540","2706920"," The high end. "
"2707700","2712620"," There's another spot below where you have a high and a low of breaking the weekly moving average."
"2713200","2715740"," The second spot would be that high area."
"2716040","2719260"," And this in the low area would be that third buy for you. "
"2719400","2721960"," So you don't actually miss that swing high."
"2722080","2726720"," You start with I believe it's 15 or 15 percent or 30 percent."
"2726840","2727180"," Then you do it. "
"2727460","2728360"," No, it's a 15 percent."
"2728500","2732160"," Then I think it's 45 percent and then 50 percent for that last buy."
"2732960","2736440"," So if the market does recover you're already you're invested. "
"2737180","2741900"," If your if the market continues lower you can dollar cost average in."
"2742420","2748620"," And it would only be you'd only be behind by a tiny fraction of where you would need it to"
"2748620","2748800"," be."
"2749140","2750160"," We can talk about that again. "
"2750420","2751920"," Maybe I'll just make a post about it."
"2752680","2754180"," So you guys can comprehend that."
"2754680","2758720"," I could do what I'll do is I'll do a post where I show three buy areas for Tesla specifically. "
"2758720","2761720"," Or the spy if we were to bloodbath this."
"2761960","2769020"," If we got down to like 260 300 240 210 something like that doesn't matter."
"2769100","2774600"," If we had a legitimate market collapse how you would still buy right here. "
"2774940","2780820"," You would still buy at the 300 320 level and then you would buy the 260 level just percentage wise."
"2780840","2782320"," You would still be ahead."
"2782800","2787960"," Now if the market reversed before we ever got there you would still be way ahead as well. "
"2787960","2789780"," So this is still a place."
"2790180","2796580"," If you're buying the stock market actually buy stock anywhere down here like 360 350 somewhere down"
"2796580","2800540"," here is one of the areas to actually accumulate this market."
"2801620","2802860"," So make a post about that. "
"2803260","2807720"," I'll make sure I take a post about that before the weekend is out or before the weekend starts or"
"2807720","2808520"," maybe over the weekend."
"2809100","2814180"," I'll make that post so you can actually see how that works even in market failure market collapse"
"2814180","2815620"," that you would want."
"2815620","2823320"," Now the only caveat I would put on that is I would personally I probably wouldn't buy Tesla. "
"2823920","2827540"," I would buy like the S&P 500 and not Tesla."
"2827640","2830820"," And the only reason they can go back and buy Tesla this is they're the key."
"2831860","2837180"," You can go back and buy Tesla in this post I'll make you can actually go back and buy Tesla"
"2837180","2838800"," or whatever price it's at. "
"2839560","2842420"," And it would be just like you bought Tesla at the bottom."
"2842960","2850920"," The only caveat to the statement that I'm making is that you have some insurance making these three"
"2850920","2858680"," buy areas by buying the S&P 500 due to bankruptcy failures of companies, especially stuff that's"
"2858680","2858940"," unknown."
"2859660","2863500"," You might you might not expect a big company to clear bankruptcy. "
"2863740","2869240"," I'm not saying that Tesla does, but I am saying that you get protected by that by actually buying"
"2869240","2869980"," the S&P 500."
"2870540","2872120"," If we have that market collapse."
"2872340","2873260"," Let's see if the mark that's good. "
"2873360","2876240"," I don't like let's say spy goes down a 260 to 40."
"2876780","2879580"," Some kind of real nastiness right to 10."
"2881120","2887420"," You would want to own that rather than any company so that the S&P 500 would be. "
"2888900","2893780"," Would dump and add companies that survived and then we're going to move up and then you could take"
"2893780","2894620"," your pick of companies."
"2894860","2896680"," You can say, Oh, yeah, you know, I'm going to buy Tesla."
"2896900","2897260"," I'm going to buy. "
"2897680","2902600"," I don't fucking know Walmart or whatever company you you think is high growth Apple."
"2902700","2906580"," If Apple were to survive if Google were to survive, but you never know."
"2906760","2907800"," Sometimes we have these mark collapses. "
"2907800","2912540"," You'll find a large company like a Google believe it or not and you look like a Google."
"2913320","2919360"," I know you say this will never happen, but any of these real big fortune 500 companies could"
"2919360","2920500"," collapse."
"2920560","2924860"," And you don't just don't know in the background what's going on with their company and their"
"2924860","2925340"," internals. "
"2925840","2929680"," Trading higher now trying to get back to that 376 50."
"2930400","2932460"," We're seeing that move higher right now currently."
"2933220","2934940"," We'll see if we can continue higher from there. "
"2935360","2939740"," I'm going to give you a better target here above and see if we can see anything."
"2939740","2943200"," Real light trading today relevant to normally."
"2943420","2944600"," We don't have a ton of trading today. "
"2945580","2951320"," The 376 65 would be another target here above."
"2952300","2957560"," We'll take a look here and let me see if I can get back to the spiral quick."
"2968900","2971320"," So 370 we look here. "
"2975700","2981500"," Looks like we're hitting that 365 looks like the solids are coming down 376 50 right now."
"2981500","2983320"," So we're getting the pause here."
"2985500","2990480"," Now look above to 378 next and 376 72. "
"2991100","2993400"," So we'll actually bring this one down just so we can."
"2995420","2997820"," 377 50 somewhere right in here."
"2998500","3001500"," Actually, we'll just break that one right there. "
"3002460","3006960"," And we'll see if we can break up into this zone above and actually want to see that."
"3007700","3009300"," See if there's a rejection here."
"3013640","3017860"," 376 67 right there. "
"3019220","3020500"," Draw a little box here."
"3022080","3023680"," Make this clear as day for you."
"3025180","3026020"," Right there. "
"3033200","3039840"," The U.S. is to sell $45 billion of three month bills on July 5 to settle on July 7."
"3040320","3045120"," The U.S. is to sell $42 billion of six month bills on July 5 to settle on July 7."
"3047800","3055080"," We got some 380 C's that were at like 88 cents and up to $1.30. They're for July 1st."
"3059440","3062040"," Still have 390s as well for July 1st."
"3064060","3065480"," Anything I got 400s. "
"3065940","3067480"," I think it's a 400s that burnt the ground."
"3067680","3068780"," They're like nine cents yesterday."
"3069440","3071940"," I think they killed them together in one penny now. "
"3073200","3075000"," So they murdered all the 400s."
"3075060","3078440"," So you can just take 400 and say no fucking way is that happening."
"3079740","3082360"," You can go at nine cents yesterday. "
"3084220","3086040"," It's got a little bit of rejection coming up here."
"3086440","3089320"," Look for a retest of VWAP down below 374 64."
"3090220","3091820"," We'll start chart it out for you. "
"3091960","3093480"," See if there's a dip by we had."
"3094320","3095240"," I'm looking for here."
"3098160","3099080"," We're on here. "
"3099600","3100680"," Some walking is going on."

"3405210","3406510"," We got a name for him. "
"3406570","3409150"," We'll turn his voice down."
"3413980","3415260"," Turn him down a little bit."
"3419880","3420540"," Let me see"
"3420540","3433900"," what"
"3433900","3434700"," you guys are saying. "
"3438300","3444540"," You can see the QCOM 100P."
"3445900","3450480"," The QCOM 100P is an odd one."
"3462770","3465290"," You're talking about a market break. "
"3465570","3467570"," We're going to get a market break."
"3472100","3473720"," I can see the logic behind it."
"3476280","3480120"," That would put it back down to what's the mark flows?"
"3480520","3482440"," Mark flows are 5571. "
"3490650","3494630"," You're basically saying this is distribution."
"3495030","3496610"," We know what distribution looks like."
"3496610","3501210"," I would assume that they're thinking more than just 100. "
"3502350","3504770"," This seems like a logical stop down here."
"3505330","3508270"," There's some support here at 100, roughly here, right?"
"3508730","3510410"," We've got freefall down below."
"3515970","3518490"," I would say this is real support, even below. "
"3523690","3524730"," Somewhere right here."
"3526110","3536330"," The price target down below is going to be with that trade between 91,"
"3536650","3539550"," 18, and 71, 42, if it can even survive that."
"3540130","3543630"," My one question on QCOM would be, would there be a merger in here at some point?"
"3544530","3546930"," That would be my question down in here. "
"3548130","3549230"," This is the price target."
"3549410","3550190"," We always revisit these."
"3550310","3552170"," We tag these and revisit them. "
"3555930","3557330"," We'll see if we hit it."
"3560130","3562710"," This is going into 2023, right?"
"3566350","3567670"," I think it was January."
"3567970","3571430"," It could be wrong in this, but I think it was January 2023. "
"3572810","3573870"," There's the price target."
"3574450","3575290"," That's my price target."
"3575710","3577390"," If you get 100Ps, you got to get lower. "
"3577910","3582690"," If they're doing 100Ps, I'm assuming they're expecting $71 to $91 on QCOM."
"3584150","3585070"," It's pretty significant."
"3590370","3592510"," Nice little rip again on the spot. "
"3592750","3593690"," This is beautiful right here."
"3593750","3597450"," If you guys are watching closely on day trading, this is a beautiful little."
"3597630","3599630"," We drew this in right here before it happened. "
"3600170","3601930"," Trying to head back up again."
"3602230","3606670"," $377.50 is on board and higher to $379."
"3607410","3611870"," We got $377.50. We have a nice little squeeze in here. "
"3614130","3620390"," Then above, you can see if you follow my cursor, we've got $378.93. We're going to raise this up"
"3620390","3621170"," slightly up here."
"3624700","3634630"," We'll see if we can get $389.50. They're not losing one other note to watch"
"3634630","3635390"," my cursor right here."
"3635530","3640230"," Every time we consolidate here, I'm not losing any money on these calls. "
"3640230","3643490"," They're just maintaining their premium."
"3643810","3649030"," Just heads up on the squeeze that's taking place that the squeeze is."
"3649610","3651250"," We are also maintaining. "
"3652450","3656810"," We'll move this little bull flag as we create another one."
"3656930","3658470"," Usually get three pumps minimum."
"3659190","3665910"," We've got one, two, and maybe that third one up here at $378.79. Somewhere up in here. "
"3667290","3668630"," $379 is right here."
"3668630","3669750"," That would be expected."
"3670630","3672690"," They move them and expect this somewhere. "
"3676690","3677970"," Let's see again."
"3679410","3680290"," Put one in."
"3685830","3686770"," Somewhere in here. "
"3688110","3689470"," That's what I'm going to expect it to go to."
"3690690","3693870"," Not guaranteed, but a decent chance of it heading up here."
"3696070","3699050"," And as we see rolling, rolling hedging coming in. "
"3702750","3703250"," Okay."
"3703610","3705010"," Let's see what you guys are talking about."
"3707870","3708970"," Good morning, Matthew. "
"3709190","3709430"," How are you?"
"3710850","3711770"," You guys want to?"
"3711930","3717290"," I'll load up Tesla so you guys can see where to expect Tesla to go for today."
"3718390","3722350"," It should follow the spy dish."
"3725050","3735110"," So we'll take a look. "
"3740710","3747270"," We'll let Tesla load up in the background."
"3747690","3750130"," I'll keep going through and see what you guys are saying in the chat."
"3752030","3753410"," Yeah, so let's talk about that. "
"3753690","3755770"," So Captain, does your flow system show a cell?"
"3758990","3760830"," Yeah, so I thought it was that whale too."
"3761450","3763430"," Marcus, I thought that was the whale."
"3766470","3770690"," I don't think that's the JPM trade, but my guess, I haven't looked yet. "
"3771190","3773210"," But I think that that is the whale."
"3773550","3778790"," And I also think that the JPM trade is probably, I haven't looked yet to see if JPM trade is"
"3778790","3779830"," done yet or partial."
"3779830","3780950"," Sometimes it's done in the morning. "
"3781470","3785350"," So to think a bunch of that stuff in JPM trade, they're going to try to obscure it this year"
"3785350","3786550"," or this quarter."
"3786950","3789210"," Supposedly, that's the whispers on the street."
"3789590","3793290"," Second thing is they might break it up when they place that trade. "
"3793290","3794430"," It might already be out."
"3794530","3795030"," I haven't looked."
"3795270","3799810"," And this could just be the whale or it could be someone marrying that trade as it came out this"
"3799810","3800070"," morning. "
"3800390","3803270"," So I'm not quite clear yet on that trade."
"3803710","3810010"," But I want to tell you though, pertaining to your question specifically, that this flow software."
"3810650","3813270"," So I've had every flow software out there. "
"3814270","3815450"," Some are better than others."
"3815910","3817610"," Some tell you more information than others."
"3818310","3821230"," This one tells you specifically that it's a buy. "
"3821630","3822210"," It's not a cell."
"3822210","3825870"," And I don't want to talk about the argument between is it a buyer?"
"3826050","3827070"," A seller is always a buyer."
"3827290","3828490"," A seller in every side of your trade. "
"3828630","3834090"," A spokesman, a spokesman, criminal sees risks that Western sanctions could hit Russia's revenues"
"3834090","3835410"," from oil exports."
"3836970","3838890"," We can talk about gas problem later on too."

"3879750","3882410"," And there's signatures even to options flow."
"3883050","3885030"," And so they'll track them as they come in. "
"3885270","3888050"," They track how unusual they are, what makes them unusual."
"3889030","3891750"," If a ticker typically does, it has to do."
"3891870","3893070"," I've got the list somewhere. "
"3893870","3895110"," But I always forget it."
"3895190","3897930"," I study it and then I fucking forget what it all means."
"3899150","3905410"," Generally I use this flow software for immediate impact on the market or just the trend in the day. "
"3906350","3912070"," Or specifically even for today being in a quarter I use it to see where the hedging lies are being"
"3912070","3912870"," put in the market."
"3913130","3915190"," And this stuff's all at the ask or above."
"3915950","3917210"," This is aggressive buying. "
"3917930","3919350"," And it's also when it's split."
"3919950","3925370"," If it's split, if it's whatever the other fucking two are."
"3925850","3926410"," I'm on top of my head. "
"3926490","3927390"," I can't think of it right now."
"3928250","3931170"," A sweep, a split or whatever the other one is."
"3931350","3931810"," It's like a third one. "
"3933010","3934510"," The fed bids before."
"3934790","3934990"," Yeah."
"3935050","3936450"," It could be that same way. "
"3936490","3942340"," No, no, not not."
"3942600","3942840"," Yeah."
"3943020","3943980"," Have I tried unusual whales?"
"3944240","3944340"," Yeah. "
"3944600","3945620"," Fucking usual whales too."
"3946040","3946460"," Seriously."
"3947380","3947980"," Okay. "
"3948260","3950020"," I've literally tried every."
"3950580","3953320"," Every flow software out there."
"3953700","3956120"," And the best, most accurate. "
"3957780","3958760"," The key."
"3963560","3964940"," I used to trade often."
"3965160","3965800"," I used to trade swings. "
"3966800","3968060"," I'd trade one to three month calls."
"3968200","3972540"," I got a whole show on why you can't do any of that stuff right now."
"3973260","3974200"," And this market has a bull. "
"3975220","3978740"," And I've been reduced to mostly trading the S&P 500."
"3979560","3982660"," It's also just keeping an eye on the oil market as well."
"3982860","3986620"," Yes, it's January headed for its first monthly decline since November. "
"3987260","3989780"," As I think plus completed the return of output."
"3989780","3995760"," It halted during the pandemic and the US President Biden said he'll push allies in the Persian Gulf"
"3995760","3997900"," region to boost production next month."
"3998420","4005100"," So you had WTI that dropped as much as 4.3% alongside broader markets to trade near $105 a"
"4005100","4005360"," barrel. "
"4006320","4010900"," Biden did say he requests more output at the Gulf Corporation Council forum rather than asking"
"4010900","4012200"," Saudi Arabia directly."
"4012980","4017960"," Remember, he is supposed to be going to Riyadh in July or mid July."
"4020110","4023390"," So I'm trying to remember back. "
"4023570","4025470"," Horse lover, Fat and I were talking about this."
"4025650","4028890"," I think back in January or December of 2021."
"4030370","4036190"," Where we were cutting all of our holdings back in that time period. "
"4036930","4038590"," We were cutting and I was reduced."
"4038950","4043810"," I had reduced down to very small holdings in the stock market and then by September."
"4045910","4048110"," August, September of 2021. "
"4048290","4053630"," I was making videos on to sell the last of your holdings."
"4053630","4055130"," If you were holding like apples."
"4055970","4064010"," Anything that was part of the of the of the of the QT stuff. "
"4064230","4068530"," Like the corporate, the corporate debt bonds and stuff like that were there being supported by that"
"4068530","4068770"," program."
"4068770","4073250"," That was when I got out of my last of my Apple stuff and Tesla stuff."
"4074370","4078270"," And then that from then into January of this year. "
"4078810","4085110"," I've been I've reduced myself to only trading the S&P 500 rather than individual tickers."
"4088110","4095510"," Let me see what you talked about."
"4097710","4100430"," Yeah, I thought GLD was not pay for gold. "
"4100430","4104550"," I thought that was backed by did they stop backing GLD by real gold."
"4111939","4114040"," I didn't I haven't seen that article winky either."
"4114640","4119660"," Does that does that have to do with the GLD ticker that claims that they own they own the physical"
"4119660","4121660"," rock gold or whatever. "
"4122279","4122680"," Okay."
"4122960","4124240"," Yeah, we all bring Apple for you."
"4124340","4125300"," Let's do Tesla real quick. "
"4126600","4128160"," I'm going to move this one up here."
"4128520","4129540"," Can you just second here."
"4130600","4135819"," To actually get a nice little print off this one this next one. "
"4137020","4138939"," Which usually leads to a nice nice river."
"4140380","4145000"," I'll do Apple next looks like a Tesla Tesla is bouncing off some resistance here want you to see"
"4145000","4145200"," this."
"4146180","4152560"," This is there is some resistance forming here in the spy then if you see this resistance on Tesla"
"4152560","4154180"," be wary of this right here. "
"4155340","4161859"," Good job of calling out looking at Tesla because this is some some pretty significant resistance."
"4163319","4169200"," We'll look above 668 680 excuse me 686 680."
"4169880","4171680"," You might get some resistance here. "
"4173279","4174899"," And then that famous 700."
"4175420","4181180"," It's a big one to be looking at right here on Tesla 688 686 seems like a volatility trigger of"
"4181180","4181600"," some kind."
"4182600","4184859"," The actually starts lower at 684 39. "
"4186120","4187920"," If you're long on calls right now."
"4190460","4193300"," We want to see this we want to see this grind through here."
"4194560","4199020"," It was pretty big resistance as well and then we get looks like we get up some volatility above. "
"4200040","4201380"," That's 688 or so."
"4203520","4205480"," We can see that yeah see that right there."
"4207320","4213260"," 686 this is pretty significant resistance here when I actually adjust this and look to go down. "
"4215060","4220340"," So if we can break through this part here should be clear skies though to through 686 on Tesla."
"4220920","4221900"," We'll look at Apple next."
"4222780","4224020"," Actually just leave this up. "
"4224780","4226980"," And then I'll bring up Apple next just a reminder."
"4227320","4231220"," 30 am Eastern time the US is to sell 35 billion dollars for week bills."
"4231540","4233520"," Previous bit to cover ratio being two to 90. "
"4233940","4236540"," Previous high yield rate being one spot one zero zero percent."
"4237520","4239080"," Go back to the spy real quick."
"4239900","4241520"," There's no resistance here in the spy. "
"4241520","4243840"," This could be hidden resistance on the spy."
"4245160","4246520"," So be conscious of this."
"4246640","4247940"," Be careful of a quick rollover here. "
"4248040","4248580"," You're seeing research."
"4248800","4251100"," Financial times you can minister's tap box."
"4251100","4253420"," Just for a new nuclear plant. "
"4253680","4263470"," See me and that fix is just building."
"4263790","4265290"," I want to see you guys to see some here."
"4267610","4270870"," Just overall like market market views. "
"4270970","4272390"," Take a look at this financial times piece."
"4272450","4276490"," You can minister's certified Barclays to lead a search for investors willing to back a large new"
"4276490","4277890"," nuclear plant at the size."
"4278830","4283350"," Well, in England's East Coast as part of a push for more secure domestic energy sources. "
"4283690","4285670"," According to four people familiar with the appointment."
"4286150","4290670"," The government is keen to forge ahead with the three spot two gigawatt plant capable of generating"
"4290670","4292530"," electricity for six million homes."
"4292670","4298190"," That size well in Suffolk as part of the as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's aim to build"
"4298190","4299970"," eight nuclear reactors by 2030. "
"4300670","4301870"," We'll shortly post out this."
"4302110","4303370"," Let me eat that right there."
"4303450","4304310"," I don't want to listen that guy talk. "
"4304810","4305710"," What's his name again?"
"4306110","4306710"," I forget his name."
"4306710","4308250"," But you see this up here, right?"
"4308590","4309290"," That's nice move up."
"4309490","4310570"," Another one up up, right?"
"4311110","4311610"," Another one up. "
"4312010","4312450"," Another one up."
"4312810","4317350"," And initially the thought process was we break through here, right?"
"4317730","4319070"," This would be a great earnings cycle."
"4319070","4323450"," And then you might get that swing up later in the year, but we're not seeing that right now. "
"4323910","4325350"," You're actually seeing a bid."
"4327010","4327910"," In this, right?"
"4328130","4333010"," If we blast up through here, this would be that nastiness that comes into July."
"4334330","4335150"," We see that. "
"4335250","4337710"," Well, you wouldn't see probably a higher than 40% of 40%."
"4337710","4339630"," Maybe you'll see 50, possibly."
"4342530","4344410"," That's just the largest time frame on the VIX. "
"4349790","4351350"," I'm going to take a look around the market real quick."
"4356290","4357930"," Let's take a look around the market together."
"4358770","4360070"," Because I don't know that everybody does this. "
"4360710","4364510"," If you don't do this, if you trade the stock market, I want you to start doing this."
"4365150","4369350"," So if you're in the middle of your day and you don't know where we're headed, you should be"
"4369350","4370050"," checking a few things."
"4370210","4371510"," Look at where the quote, quote, quote, comma. "
"4371690","4372390"," Look at where the Tesla."
"4372990","4374570"," I don't care if you trade and Tesla."
"4374570","4377610"," I don't care if you trade in the spy. "
"4377950","4379230"," I don't care if you trade in the queues."
"4380070","4380810"," I don't care which trade."
"4381730","4382630"," That's the meme stock. "
"4383350","4385530"," I guess you do the inverse of the meme stock, right?"
"4386430","4387810"," First thing I'm going to check in is the VIX, right?"
"4387990","4389390"," Where are we at in the VIX, where you took a look at that?"
"4389970","4390510"," Do you want to check the spy?"
"4391710","4392030"," Right?"
"4394390","4396250"," Coming in, you might be questioning yourself."
"4396410","4397670"," We're coming to resistance here or not."
"4397830","4398270"," I don't know. "
"4398850","4399110"," Right?"
"4399350","4400550"," So we're going to look and see if we are."
"4401070","4401230"," Right?"
"4401430","4401810"," XLK."
"4402210","4404470"," I'm not seeing any resistance here in XLK. "
"4404910","4405290"," Right?"
"4405450","4406590"," I'm not seeing it till we get above."
"4407330","4407530"," Right?"
"4407590","4408530"," So I think we got room to go."
"4408690","4408810"," Right?"
"4409070","4411890"," XLK, big, big waiter of the S&P 500. "
"4412110","4413190"," So I think we got some push ahead."
"4413270","4413550"," Right?"
"4414210","4416550"," Probably up to 127.95. Right?"
"4417050","4419330"," XLF, another big driver of the stock market."
"4419530","4420570"," We already know we're heading higher. "
"4420570","4423570"," We're not going to see any kind of resistance till we get to the 3167."
"4424690","4427410"," We already looked at the VIX and said it can drop down to 28 and change."
"4428330","4428390"," Right?"
"4428550","4430870"," We're going to look at XLE, same kind of a thing. "
"4431170","4435070"," We know that XLK can trade on its own without the market going its same way."
"4435130","4438550"," But you can see that XLE has a little bit of room here to push higher."
"4439250","4439350"," Right?"
"4439550","4441430"," It's driving the S&P 500 right now. "
"4442070","4443870"," XLV, shit in the bed right now."
"4444010","4445130"," That's not a good sign."
"4446050","4449830"," I don't like seeing this because I want to be long XLV right now. "
"4449830","4452970"," This is concerning seeing this dip in XLV."
"4453290","4454250"," I don't like seeing this."
"4455010","4460040"," Let me take a look back and get this back here. "
"4460720","4461280"," Five day."
"4461900","4462660"," Right there."
"4462740","4463840"," It's just kind of looking kind of bullish. "
"4464800","4465440"," Be honest with you."
"4467240","4469260"," This is actually looking kind of bullish to me."
"4471000","4473140"," I'm interested in this now that I'm looking at it more closely. "
"4474420","4474860"," Oops."
"4475320","4475860"," Give her that."
"4481420","4482020"," Juicy. "
"4482780","4484340"," I like that a lot."
"4485500","4489100"," It's something to look into for next week sometime."
"4489540","4491420"," We're talking yesterday about XLV yesterday. "
"4491720","4495640"," I like the idea of being long in XLV into July or August."
"4496700","4497960"," XLRE real estate."
"4498360","4499460"," I don't know about this one. "
"4499600","4502260"," This one's looking kind of bearish to be expected."
"4504700","4506820"," Industrials are extra materials."
"4507020","4508120"," They're like a lot right now as well. "
"4508880","4513800"," The idea of materials like to see this bottom down below here on XLV."
"4514640","4516580"," Similar down here with XLI."
"4518460","4525600"," We know that the spy can move higher because of XLK and XLF. "
"4528750","4529710"," That's a lower low."
"4529890","4530530"," That's not healthy."
"4530530","4532570"," I don't like seeing that down here. "
"4533430","4533870"," XLB."
"4534030","4536170"," I want to be long XLB too."
"4536790","4538090"," I'm not happy with that lower low. "
"4539130","4539570"," XLY."
"4540790","4544010"," It's kind of a higher low going all the way back to the 16th."
"4547110","4547550"," XLP. "
"4547910","4549450"," This is not good watching this stuff."
"4550390","4551190"," I don't like seeing that."
"4551510","4559730"," This is definitely looking like a rollover. "
"4562230","4563670"," This actually could be pretty bullish."
"4566670","4569310"," I don't want to see that drop over there."
"4570090","4570850"," Then there's NDX. "
"4572130","4573170"," The spy has some room to go."
"4573410","4575250"," You can see that spy has some room to move higher."
"4575910","4578790"," Try to look around here around the market and see what the spy can do. "
"4580230","4581630"," The attempt to close this gap."
"4582090","4586810"," I probably want to pay attention to a gap failure here on..."
"4587990","4588670"," Hold on here."
"4588670","4591290"," If you want to look, make sure you don't get a gap failure on NDX. "
"4596620","4598540"," You want to see that gap get closed."
"4600000","4601800"," 1154 to 11 619."
"4602660","4603680"," That's kind of concerning. "
"4605320","4607540"," Nice trading higher still in the spy."
"4614070","4615410"," Let's see how we can get."
"4616570","4618270"," I'm going to watch my calls over here. "
"4619450","4620910"," 379.50, 380."
"4623010","4624470"," We're going to extend this box up."
"4627520","4633960"," My 380P or 3DCs are now $1.92. They were 88 cents, so they're at 110%. "
"4633960","4636440"," I'm going to put a stop in up here right now."
"4641690","4650910"," I'm going to put a stop at $1.80. They're doing very well."
"4653690","4656210"," Price target above right now is 30, 80, 50. "
"4657310","4658670"," I doubt we get this high."
"4658810","4660190"," This is going to be doubtful up here, okay?"
"4660770","4662550"," Should I write that in there?"
"4663270","4664470"," You have to write that in there for you guys."
"4664570","4665170"," You guys already know. "
"4666110","4667150"," Nice beautiful move."
"4667370","4668790"," Talked about this move right here."
"4668850","4669930"," It should lead to a large rip. "
"4670050","4671250"," We did get that large rip."
"4671950","4675170"," We're going to see how long we can stay with this trend higher."
"4675710","4681690"," See if we can take it to 380.50. Now, 380C is where it sat on July 1st. "
"4682150","4683370"," I am not looking on July 30th."
"4683370","4691630"," I don't want to have to deal with the 3DCs or at 97 cents right now for June 30th."
"4691630","4696690"," I'm on June 1st because I don't want to deal with losing all my money with pullback. "
"4705090","4706310"," So we'll see how this goes."
"4714620","4715400"," That's a good trade."
"4716240","4716820"," It's a great trade. "
"4717520","4718300"," It's an outstanding trade."
"4719760","4721840"," I'm going to fly by that gap, my opinion."
"4722040","4726360"," We want to collapse unless we kill the bears and the way down has Tesla reach the bottom. "
"4726820","4727700"," Which bottom Trevor?"
"4728160","4733280"," I need to know if you mean today, if you mean next month, if you mean this year."
"4734020","4734740"," I need more context."
"4735140","4737180"," Sometimes if you guys ask me questions, make sure you give me more context. "
"4738720","4739280"," Pumping now."
"4739600","4739660"," Yup."
"4740220","4740300"," Cough. "
"4740520","4741160"," Do you do live streams?"
"4741460","4741740"," This is awesome."
"4742000","4743560"," Just crushed with nice gains and 380Cs."
"4744180","4744820"," Hey, you're welcome, Ross. "
"4745460","4746680"," I used to do them every day."
"4748260","4751000"," But so my issue is that."
"4752820","4756160"," My issue is that I'm being forced into. "
"4757440","4759700"," You're basically forced into a pay model."
"4760600","4762700"," That's the legitimate what it is."
"4762700","4764720"," You're basically by all the. "
"4766540","4768260"," Technically, I'm not supposed to take donations."
"4770080","4775420"," They froze my donation page once and I could lose any donations that I receive."
"4776460","4780300"," So I stopped doing live streams because I don't want to charge for a subscription. "
"4782220","4783880"," So I, but I've been doing them."
"4784920","4787220"," So I've been taking breaks from doing live streams."
"4787300","4788600"," I prefer to do them every day. "
"4790200","4791900"," I just haven't been able to."
"4792180","4795520"," And the other issue is that if I don't do a pay model."
"4796580","4798420"," It doesn't really pay for itself. "
"4798600","4799400"," It costs me money."
"4799500","4800440"," It costs me a lot of money."
"4801020","4801720"," In time. "
"4802100","4806360"," And so I need to find that balance and I haven't been able to find that balance to do live"
"4806360","4807160"," streams every day."
"4807980","4809220"," So I'm still working on that."
"4809640","4812620"," I haven't found something that I like so my conscience. "
"4813920","4817280"," Like as a person as a human, like I have a conscience believe it or not."
"4819580","4821540"," And so we'll see if we get another one here."
"4821940","4822660"," I believe it or not. "
"4822780","4825960"," I don't want to steal your money or get you pissed off at me anything like that."
"4828660","4830520"," And I'm going to try my trader myself."
"4830840","4833560"," So I don't know. "
"4834180","4834500"," Yeah."
"4834760","4836340"," So I don't make my money from you guys."
"4838780","4841760"," So, but I just, I just, I just, I just got to try. "
"4841860","4844660"," I just sold my, I also my calls."
"4847260","4849820"," So wait to see if I can rebuy in here again."
"4851080","4853280"," I like to see, I'd like to see us get up here. "
"4853440","4854860"," So I might put some back on the table."
"4854860","4855120"," Yeah."
"4855160","4856120"," I'm going to put some back on. "
"4856140","4857380"," Actually, this is firming up right now."
"4857380","4858020"," Want you to see this?"
"4859760","4860160"," 37886."
"4861560","4863180"," So we're just going to get rid of this box. "
"4863520","4864540"," We could extend here."
"4864600","4865660"," Watch my cursor on the left."
"4866160","4869860"," We could extend here, but the price target is going to be right right below here. "
"4870100","4870600"," Just heads up."
"4872500","4874240"," Let me see if we can find that for you."
"4875300","4875700"," 37876. "
"4876620","4879380"," So just be careful right around here."
"4880580","4880980"," Okay."
"4881560","4885380"," So we'll see if we get, see if we get one more pump up here. "
"4885940","4886760"," I might put some more."
"4889040","4890560"," Plus my wife just yelled at me."
"4890680","4892000"," She was like, why aren't you live streaming?"
"4892960","4894940"," Because I, because I haven't been live streaming, I don't have a job. "
"4895240","4895980"," I don't, I don't work."
"4896460","4897380"," I trade for a living."
"4899100","4900540"," Best job you can ever have. "
"4901700","4904740"," So I trade and I bought a, I just bought another house."
"4905920","4908920"," I buy these by cheap houses and then I renovate them."
"4909620","4912160"," I live in them and they're, I sell them or I rent them out. "
"4913240","4915280"," And seven working on a house I just bought."
"4916420","4918760"," I'm thinking about doing documentary for that too, if anyone wants to know."
"4919660","4923900"," So if you guys want to buy a cheap house and know how to do it, little to see public. "
"4924200","4925240"," No paywall or nothing."
"4928140","4930620"," So anyways, this, I appreciate the comments, man."
"4931040","4931960"," Thanks for saying something. "
"4934120","4936400"," Oh, the movie gold?"
"4936760","4936800"," Nope."
"4936800","4936900"," Nope."
"4937220","4939660"," You know, I think I say, I'll have to go back and watch that gold movie again. "
"4950350","4951790"," Hey, you remember good to see you in here."
"4952150","4952730"," How you been brother?"
"4959330","4961210"," Let me see the girl through and see you guys are saying."
"4962330","4964450"," You got a great comment section, by the way. "
"4966710","4969660"," Uh, you got voices, news."
"4970220","4971200"," We're trying to give them a new name."
"4971360","4972980"," We have to get the name that sticks for this guy. "
"4977810","4979990"," I'm trying to scroll through up to you guys are talking about."
"4982290","4984230"," Let me go back to the bottom and see you guys are saying."
"4986210","4991130"," Uh, how can we donate without issue?"
"4991610","4993250"," So you can donate right now without issue. "
"4993530","4997970"," I had a, I had a meeting of a live meeting with PayPal."
"4998550","4999170"," They're fine again."
"4999870","5006190"," Uh, so I reposted donation links on the YouTube video and I reposted recently on. "
"5006190","5010310"," My captain's alpha handle and my captain's and James handle."
"5010450","5012690"," I changed to a donation link."
"5013270","5015350"," Uh, so they're allowing me back to that again. "
"5015950","5018850"," Uh, I just don't want it to go to it's, it's a long complicated thing."
"5019090","5019510"," You guys understand?"
"5020230","5022150"," Like I saw you guys subscription or anything like that."
"5023090","5026390"," Um, um, I have to promise you certain things. "
"5026650","5028330"," There's some other aspects to it too."
"5029530","5032030"," Um, you guys know when you guys subscribe to people."
"5032690","5033670"," They leave it out. "
"5034430","5035510"," They always leave it out."
"5036870","5042810"," They're always like, so there's always an out like there's always like, well, I'll give you both,"
"5042810","5044590"," you know, we can trade here."
"5044590","5049450"," We can trade there, but I'm not going to tell you where my bias is. "
"5052230","5054210"," Um, it's, it's kind of sketchy."
"5055270","5057730"," Winky and I were talking about, uh, spot gamma."
"5060130","5064350"," And you know, it's so fucking sketchy these guys and they get paid a bunch of money. "
"5064350","5068810"," It's really bizarre cause I was talking to Joe Donut and he's like, you have a, you create value by"
"5068810","5069690"," selling it for a price."
"5070210","5074870"," Cause if you do a price, he's like, cause if you do a price, they think it's more valuable for"
"5074870","5075310"," some reason."
"5075850","5079650"," And then, but there's so many other, like this churn, there's always other nonsense things you have"
"5079650","5079930"," to do. "
"5080470","5082370"," I just have no, I have no interest in being that guy."
"5082850","5083590"," I never have."
"5084010","5087830"," I've never been, I've never sold services, uh, anything like that. "
"5087930","5093750"," I've always just been, uh, either an entrepreneur for myself, where I produce something, uh, like"
"5093750","5099270"," actually produce something or, uh, I've worked where I produce something for somebody else when I"
"5099270","5099610"," was younger."
"5100450","5108650"," Um, I've never, I've never been a sales person per se, um, or wanted to be a sales person where"
"5108650","5110710"," you're not getting something for you're paying for."
"5110910","5119310"," So, uh, it's hard for me to, um, justify something that's free and available on the internet. "
"5119310","5120710"," It, it really is."
"5121330","5125630"," Uh, it's hard for me to justify something when I, uh, one time I was a new trader and I"
"5125630","5128230"," fucking got smoked for years."
"5129710","5130510"," Got smoked. "
"5133170","5137750"," So, uh, in, it's, it's, I used to pay for mentorships."
"5137830","5139510"," And I had some good ones, but I had some bad ones."
"5140490","5143290"," Um, and I picked, you spent a lot of money for them. "
"5143370","5148310"," And you just see people come into the trading rooms and disappear from the trading rooms."
"5148490","5152830"," They were normally new traders, new investors, lots of, have lots of money."
"5153190","5155410"," And then once they whittled all their money down, they were gone. "
"5155830","5156490"," Like poof, disappear."
"5157550","5161630"," And of course you have to advertise at that point to attract more new blood."
"5162350","5166010"," Um, and there's something about that that's like kind of gross. "
"5166970","5171270"," So you want to, so my, my point is that I'd rather stick or I'd rather be here and teach"
"5171270","5173510"," you guys how to become better day traders."
"5173510","5180070"," And once we get to a point where we're back in a bull market, uh, in, in Wiki helps a"
"5180070","5184830"," lot of these traders here buy or know how to buy stocks and when to buy stocks, I tend not"
"5184830","5185870"," to focus on that right now."
"5185890","5187370"," Focused mostly on this B 500. "
"5188030","5195910"," Uh, but once the market turns, you'll see me, uh, refocus again on the individual tickers, um, and"
"5195910","5196570"," things like that."
"5196630","5200370"," So that this isn't that regime, uh, for a bull."
"5200370","5203510"," If you're a bull, the regime isn't, yeah, we're buying every fucking dip. "
"5203850","5206090"," Like we're actually buying the physical underlying stock."
"5206770","5209050"," Um, we're not in that regime right now."
"5209550","5212110"," That regime changes depending upon what market we're in. "
"5212650","5215050"," Bear markets only last like nine months or so on average."
"5215290","5221030"," They just want my last longer, but, uh, so however horrible it feels, uh, this will end soon."
"5221150","5223670"," We're on the back end of something like this happening or ending. "
"5224250","5225530"," Uh, so don't lose all hope."
"5225630","5228350"," We got a little bit of a collapse here in the VIX right now."
"5229410","5232330"," So I'm watching the VIX, uh, a little, a little VIX collapse. "
"5233390","5234850"," Uh, be careful right now in the VIX."
"5236630","5237830"," I'm going to take a look with you."
"5238830","5240270"," I'm going to show you the VIX right now. "
"5240730","5244870"," You should get a nice little pop right here on the spy, but I also want you to see that"
"5244870","5246210"," this could be a reversal sign."
"5246770","5248030"," I'm going to show you guys something right here."
"5248150","5248270"," Okay. "
"5249630","5250550"," Give me a second."
"5265620","5267780"," I should just do this in front of you, not off screen."
"5269740","5271080"," So this looks like a reversal. "
"5271280","5272900"," This looks like we're pumping right now, right on the spy."
"5274040","5275200"," And I want to show you, hold on."
"5275420","5276860"," I'm going to leave it, I'm going to leave this up for you. "
"5278560","5279800"," I want to show you guys something."
"5280360","5282520"," So we're getting a little, we're getting a little pump of the spy right now."
"5282960","5283980"," I just want you to be aware. "
"5284320","5288920"," So let's say if you can, if you can get yourself two computers or two screeners, an old, an old"
"5288920","5297040"," computer or something like up here, um, to, to hook up, right?"
"5297660","5298860"," You'll see these little pumps take place."
"5298860","5301680"," We're getting a little pump right now, but you want to see a break down below here."
"5301780","5302180"," Watch my cursor. "
"5302380","5304880"," We'll see this break to get an extension of this pump."
"5305220","5309400"," If you don't see that break, right, you're going to see a reversal of that candle here."
"5309640","5310680"," So I'm going to be aware of this. "
"5310820","5313140"," This is also another area right here, right?"
"5313320","5315120"," You see this nice gap that needs to be filled down here."
"5315140","5317820"," We want to see us get down here to 20, 31."
"5318180","5319840"," This is one of those places we should see collapse. "
"5320380","5326000"," But if we see a reversal of trade higher, you could see a failure in the, in this trade here."
"5326580","5329280"," So where you'd be like, yeah, hey, I'm going to buy right now, right?"
"5329400","5330560"," Like, hey, I'm going to buy this right here."
"5331000","5332020"," This next rip higher. "
"5332740","5337400"," You just want to be paying attention at the same time because this could be a false breakout right"
"5337400","5337660"," here."
"5338020","5341000"," We want you to pay attention to this right here, right now."
"5341640","5344520"," So you want to be, let's see, like, I want to call right now on the spot. "
"5345180","5349480"," Uh, I would personally, I haven't, I haven't re-entered yet."
"5350060","5356360"," So the three ADCs are now $1.66, $0.65, right?"
"5356540","5361820"," I want to see a break below of the, I want to see this, this plane break on the S "
"5361820","5362420","&P 500."
"5362980","5364100"," Or in the mix, excuse me. "
"5365920","5368260"," Before I enter this, these calls right now."
"5373540","5375760"," Then I think we're, I think we might get a failure here."
"5377520","5378660"," Nope, starting to break. "
"5387910","5388870"," I'm back in again."
"5395950","5397210"," So we can break through here."
"5397410","5398090"," This could be a nice rip. "
"5400270","5401790"," It would be a really nice rip."
"5404290","5411610"," Watching the flow down below, some nice calls coming in on the 12, 16, 22."
"5411870","5413390"," I'm going to keep an eye on both of this as we're doing this. "
"5414230","5417690"," XL East, December 16, 85C, $1.2 million."
"5419170","5420070"," That's a golden ticket."
"5420710","5422490"," A bunch of calls coming in on Tesla and Spy. "
"5424410","5425710"," PFE, that's not a big one."
"5426030","5429330"," Spy, 630, 375C, $286,000."
"5429750","5430870"," I want to see if this can break here. "
"5433310","5435690"," I'm looking for the, I'll show you exactly what I'm looking for here."
"5436290","5437530"," I don't want to see a reversal here."
"5437530","5439950"," I don't want to see this. "
"5442530","5443610"," That's what I don't want to see."
"5443730","5446390"," What I want to see is a failure here."
"5446770","5450690"," If you see this failure here, you're going to see Spy go to the moon. "
"5459660","5460980"," You guys all watching out there."
"5461040","5461920"," You guys all paying attention."
"5470510","5476190"," A little bit of a reversal on the Spy right or on the VIX right now. "
"5476490","5477110"," It's going higher."
"5480170","5482070"," So tight stops on this trade."
"5495850","5498150"," The fuck is going on here with Tasty Works?"
"5498910","5506480"," I have problems on Tasty Works. "
"5513290","5515750"," Keep tight spots on this trade if you're long right here."
"5518810","5519710"," This could reverse."
"5525770","5531190"," If this is your first time joining us and there's a delay in my broadcast with you, go down to"
"5531190","5537750"," the description of the YouTube show and you'll see a cog on the right-hand side. "
"5544050","5545770"," I want to see if it gets stopped."
"5549970","5556690"," I'll go down to the cog and you can click on the cog, go to the playback speed and hit"
"5556690","5559630"," the fast forward button."
"5559910","5562550"," YouTube delays these videos, all video, all live streams. "
"5562550","5567210"," If you hit the fast forward, I'll sound like a weirdo for 15 seconds and then it'll bring you up"
"5567210","5574410"," to a delay that's maybe just a few seconds from my actual broadcast so that you can follow along in"
"5574410","5576350"," real time and trade in real time with us."
"5576950","5577910"," We're doing very well."
"5578030","5578830"," I'm still in this trade. "
"5578970","5579990"," I haven't gotten stopped out yet."
"5580610","5581010"," 380C."
"5581390","5587810"," Now to $1.84. It was down to $1.70 at $1.60. So it's doing quite well once again. "
"5592460","5594220"," I started above still 380."
"5594640","5596980"," We have a little bit of resistance above a 37842."
"5598780","5601320"," I'm going to take a look back on XLK. "
"5602560","5605480"," And by fact, I'll bring this over for you real quick so you can see it."
"5606440","5608100"," I drew these in earlier, right?"
"5608300","5612160"," You guys remember me drawing these in earlier and I said, we have a little bit more room to go"
"5612160","5613000"," on XLK."
"5613340","5614140"," You saw this resistance. "
"5614500","5615740"," We hit this right already."
"5616860","5622180"," I want you to see that's going to make another attempt to close this gap back here again, right?"
"5622500","5623200"," I want you to see that."
"5623640","5625160"," I want you to also see it's probably here. "
"5625340","5627140"," XLF has a little bit more room to go."
"5627680","5628960"," I'll probably squeeze this higher."
"5629780","5631060"," I'll probably get a nice little push above here. "
"5631180","5633860"," I like the idea of XLF closing this gap right here."
"5634060","5635340"," Big driver of the S&P 500."
"5636800","5638400"," So we're going to see if we can get that push above. "
"5639220","5642060"," And we can see if we can get that push down on the VIX."
"5643520","5644220"," I'm out."
"5644960","5646500"," I got tagged out on 380Cs. "
"5654780","5656000"," I'm flat once again."
"5658830","5660370"," Let me line up another trade."
"5666530","5673010"," I'm kind of doing nothing right now. "
"5698870","5699930"," Yeah, I just got stopped."
"5699950","5701530"," I got stopped out of that fucking trade."
"5701610","5702430"," That pisses me off. "
"5704030","5706310"," We're trading higher and I got stopped out."
"5706310","5708170"," Almost like trading fucking Forex."
"5709110","5710470"," They knew where my stops were. "
"5712590","5713790"," I got stopped out of that trade."
"5714890","5716170"," Which kind of pisses me off."
"5723790","5725490"," I cleaned this up a little bit. "
"5726870","5728110"," Guys, this trade develops."
"5735330","5737070"," It's going to be in just heads up."
"5737210","5739370"," If we do fail somewhere up in here, it's going to be kind of nasty. "
"5739710","5740110"," It could be nasty."
"5746220","5747720"," We can talk about the correlation of the VIX."
"5747720","5750080"," We can talk about when the VIX and the Spy goes up. "
"5750220","5754140"," Why it goes up with the Spy when it goes down against the Spy."
"5754700","5758800"," We can talk about reduced volatility within the VIX, volleyball."
"5760040","5761160"," Why that's down right now. "
"5762460","5763500"," That's another program."
"5763860","5764540"," That's like a whole show."
"5765880","5767280"," I'm kind of pissed that I'm missing this right now. "
"5770630","5771890"," I don't like missing the trade."
"5772450","5773870"," I don't like getting fucking stopped out."
"5775710","5776910"," Looks like there's no resistance. "
"5777330","5781410"," We're at $3.78.98. We're going to raise this box up."
"5782210","5782550"," Run here."
"5785190","5786670"," This is the please get me there. "
"5789390","5793450"," $3.78.98. There's $3.79.98. Is that what it was?"
"5795210","5796210"," Kind of keep hiding it."
"5800070","5800750"," There it is."
"5800950","5801590"," Pop back up again. "
"5801890","5811670"," $3.78.82. Still kind of in that general area"
"5811670","5812250"," right here."
"5815090","5816790"," Same trades as yesterday, right?"
"5817010","5819010"," Same way to make easy money in the stock market."
"5819910","5821150"," Easy money every day. "
"5822810","5823450"," The conscience."
"5823510","5825330"," So there are some real sellers up here."
"5825830","5826510"," Point of B wear. "
"5827030","5827970"," Just the heads up."
"5828690","5830630"," Let's see this area above where my cursor is."
"5830750","5832090"," There is some resistance here. "
"5832990","5835650"," It winds up to closing the gap in XLF."
"5836650","5838970"," Another check of XLK as well."
"5839330","5842930"," Closing the gap on NDX on NASDAQ. "
"5843430","5847090"," So this move if we make it up here, I'm not saying that this is going to be a full"
"5847090","5851150"," reversal, but I would be wary up here as we get up here."
"5851270","5853430"," So if you're going to be long here as we trade higher."
"5854190","5854550"," Pushing it up. "
"5854710","5857150"," $3.77.89. Let's see if we can get up there."
"5858290","5861130"," Now have a new above here."
"5861370","5866690"," A new target above of $3.2.11. So this will be a nice new trading zone. "
"5866810","5868270"," If we can squeeze up in here."
"5871300","5873200"," If we can squeeze, not catch a rejection."
"5873460","5878700"," If you watch my cursor right here, if we can squeeze up in here and we see if we can"
"5879560","5881420"," draw this in for you. "
"5882260","5883840"," So this is very bullish by the way."
"5887800","5889100"," This is very bullish."
"5889760","5895020"," If we can squeeze up in here and bounce around a little bit, something like that. "
"5895800","5898160"," You'll see that next tag above here."
"5899440","5900260"," It's pretty bullish."
"5901480","5903360"," So we want to see that break above. "
"5903740","5908540"," This would be the test of the gaps on NASDAQ and XLFX."
"5908780","5909040"," Okay."
"5909800","5916020"," And if we can get up in here and find some footing, we'll get up to $3.82 and above. "
"5916280","5918580"," If not, we'll start to see a rollover in here."
"5919360","5920800"," So let's just see if we can get this."
"5920900","5921940"," We can move this up and ahead. "
"5924560","5926580"," We are coming into some resistance right now."
"5926700","5928860"," VIX is starting to turn around as we come into resistance."
"5929780","5931420"," This is definitely a volatility trigger. "
"5932400","5935000"," We want to see if we can break above here or not."
"5936680","5937880"," Tight stops in here."
"5938020","5941140"," If you are along this trade right here, have some tight stops. "
"5942280","5943640"," The fall could be quite severe."
"5945980","5947960"," I'm going to get this back better."
"5951780","5954040"," Nice calls coming into the market right now. "
"5954540","5959020"," Calls on Apple, Tesla, Spy, Qs, XLE."
"5959480","5961320"," Some good calls coming in right now."
"5962680","5964260"," I'm bullish on this right now. "
"5972070","5972810"," Oh, yeah."
"5974090","5979410"," Spy $3.80 is now up to $2.10 because an implied move coming up here that we're going to"
"5979410","5980330"," smash through above."
"5981410","5983770"," This is a sign over here that we're reversing. "
"5984250","5984970"," Just heads up."
"5985170","5986870"," This is a pincer or a tweezer."
"5987390","5991590"," This is showing signs of reversal of the green and then the red candle, but now you see the bulls"
"5991590","5992230"," fighting back. "
"5993670","5997670"," Three ADCs are gaining premium right now."
"5998090","6005040"," They're $2.07. See if the bulls can hold on and push us higher."
"6010850","6011850"," They can break through or not. "
"6014390","6018270"," Way to see these two candles right here are tweezers."
"6018270","6024070"," These signal reversal of trend with the bulls are fighting back on this reversal."
"6024070","6025710"," So we'll see if they can hold on to it. "
"6026250","6028330"," Should see a giant squeeze if we move higher."
"6028870","6030370"," Make sure you have tight stops."
"6031370","6033590"," And here, this is a very contentious area. "
"6043830","6050910"," New price targets above $3.82.72. $3.02. $3.02 change right up in here."
"6052590","6055770"," We'll actually keep this one low here."
"6056630","6057550"," We'll do another one. "
"6064020","6066360"," $3.82 and some change."
"6072730","6078310"," Support down below is at $3.76.43. So move this one higher."
"6086650","6096780"," $3.76.43. Not"
"6096780","6098500"," seeing any major puts come in. "
"6098500","6100880"," $40,000 is not really not a big deal."
"6101820","6104040"," $3.50. Just here."
"6104260","6108420"," $11.51. This $40,000 spy puts nothing to be honest with you. "
"6110560","6112400"," We're going to see if we're going to make this run higher."
"6112820","6116640"," See if we can get some support up here at $3.78 and then make a major move higher."
"6117380","6119100"," Lots of sellers in this area here. "
"6119260","6120120"," Don't want to be aware of that."
"6120240","6121000"," There are sellers there."
"6121280","6123240"," There is volatility here in this zone. "
"6124140","6125940"," There is risk reversal in this zone."
"6127560","6131000"," It's nice to see some supply above a $3.2.83 pop it in."
"6135980","6137040"," Let's see what happens here. "
"6142450","6145610"," I'm going to take a long, another long here, a couple seconds."
"6147230","6147950"," If I can get one."
"6149150","6152090"," Give me like a dollar E2 so I can get back in again. "
"6153330","6158750"," Say $1.97. I want $1.82. I want to pay an extra 10 cents."
"6173590","6175250"," You guys are liking this, Steven, you like this?"
"6185000","6185720"," We're on Steven."
"6187380","6188240"," Hey, drink towel. "
"6188380","6188640"," How are you?"
"6189060","6189940"," Yeah, go back in."
"6192680","6193720"," All right, fuck it."
"6193820","6196420"," Every time I do, every time I go back in, when you guys tell me to go back in reverse. "
"6200040","6200680"," All right, ready?"
"6201960","6202500"," Hold on."
"6204140","6205300"," I'm back in at two bucks."
"6209100","6210820"," I'm back in $3.80 for $2. "
"6211280","6213800"," I missed the $2.20 jump, which kind of sucks."
"6215040","6215980"," I'm back in right now."
"6219780","6221260"," Let's see if we can get this push up higher. "
"6223840","6224640"," Let's look at that."
"6224840","6226660"," Let's look at that right up in here."
"6227220","6227520"," What is that?"
"6227680","6233340"," $3.79.26. Hold on. "
"6235780","6242000"," $3.79.26. Move this line higher."
"6242000","6245280"," $3.79.26 right in here."
"6250350","6251950"," Let's see if we can get that push up in here. "
"6259650","6260290"," Fucking drink."
"6260450","6263690"," Every time you guys tell me to fucking go back and do it anyways, Cap."
"6265170","6266130"," That's why I always lose money. "
"6270190","6274830"," So Andreas has asked me why I trade spy versus EAS or the mini."
"6275490","6276530"," So I have a bunch."
"6276790","6277330"," So a couple of things. "
"6278090","6285110"," I used to, I started out, I've traded everything."
"6285470","6294850"," I don't, generally speaking right now, I don't trade futures, glowbacks, because I don't like being"
"6294850","6296310"," awake 24 hours a day."
"6297690","6300610"," And I would, it was almost like a gambling addiction. "
"6301090","6304610"," I would just spend every waking hour fucking surrounded by the market."
"6304810","6305570"," It's just too much for me."
"6307090","6312550"," I guess sometimes I get asked why I don't trade SPX for tax benefits, stuff like that. "
"6313510","6316090"," For the, I can come into this."
"6316270","6322730"," So at any given day, whenever I live trade with you guys, you guys know most days I'm winning."
"6323090","6326930"," Like I don't really lose too much date trade in the spy. "
"6329490","6337770"," So, I think I could, I wouldn't rate it like 50 to 70% during bull market, dude."
"6338870","6340730"," I would like to set it and forget it and walk away."
"6341290","6342470"," It was that fucking stupid. "
"6345630","6348010"," So spy, I can come into spy."
"6349390","6355710"," I can make more money with less risk and pay the taxes and be ahead."
"6357490","6359050"," And this is how I learned. "
"6359250","6363870"," So how I learned how to trade like this and arbitrage on zero dates and stuff like that."
"6364570","6368790"," I learned how to trade this many years ago from Wall Street bets."
"6370530","6374210"," They don't do this anymore, but no, God damn it. "
"6374390","6375990"," I think we're going to start fucking rolling it over."
"6376050","6376870"," I want to push, baby."
"6377790","6379150"," So I'm going to keep an eye. "
"6379230","6380730"," I'm going to set a stop here."
"6380770","6382430"," I'm already, I'm actually losing money right now."
"6385670","6387330"," I'm back to making my arm back to flat. "
"6389370","6390770"," I'm going to set a dollar 80."
"6394890","6396890"," So I've done everything, right?"
"6397270","6404650"," But there was a time period like seven years ago, eight years ago, maybe where I learned about"
"6404650","6414250"," arbitrage from some very, very intelligent people on Wall Street bets and it's the outside of"
"6414250","6424170"," like the places where I've made huge, vast, huge amounts of money with big, big, big"
"6424170","6432330"," hits has always been arbitrage on the spy or in a bull market in"
"6432330","6435530"," a bull market."
"6435750","6443110"," I would the only way I'd make big, big money would be like during stock splits, unknown kick ass"
"6443110","6443830"," ERs combined. "
"6446430","6455650"," Unknown news on a sideways ticker with like long leaps and stuff like that."
"6456070","6457150"," I would trade those often."
"6457930","6463310"," Mostly I made money in the past just buying a monthlies or three month calls, bull market stuff I'm"
"6463310","6463770"," talking about. "
"6465590","6471270"," But you can come into this market anytime you want, you can come into the spy regularly in the spy"
"6471270","6472250"," because it's so liquid."
"6473270","6477850"," There's so much going on in it, so much money flowing through it that you can just through"
"6477850","6481010"," arbitrage make a ton of money quickly."
"6482090","6491750"," Unlike ES, unlike ESF, unlike SPX, there's so much price action, price movement in spy"
"6491750","6495770"," itself that for me, I can't make that money. "
"6497970","6503070"," Even ES contract, I can't put 20 grand down and make 40 grand that day."
"6503830","6506830"," I'm lucky to make, you know, a thousand bucks or 500 bucks a day."
"6507550","6513290"," So there's more money to be made and in spy for me personally. "
"6534990","6537530"," I'm up a little bit, I'm up to 218 right now."
"6538070","6540270"," I'm going to switch, I'm going to change my stops to 210."
"6547130","6548310"," The stops are at 210. "
"6549270","6550970"," Now trading higher, 378, 42."
"6552850","6561350"," A little bit of squeeze higher, gets a nice big fat targets above, weak sellers above at 379, 32."
"6563230","6565990"," And then we've got a big fat juicy target. "
"6566250","6569730"," This could be, this could be up some bait, right, bull trap up here, baby."
"6570710","6572890"," And then we get that up here, 3828."
"6573690","6577370"," That's up here, you see that, like HRSA, weak sellers above. "
"6578270","6579510"," I'm going to see if we can get up in here."
"6580390","6585650"," Break through this area up here and then have a sling shot up higher to 382."
"6588300","6589060"," This is a good day. "
"6589380","6590700"," I'm very happy right now, by the way."
"6593200","6594460"," I'm going to get stopped out again."
"6599160","6600140"," Don't stop me now. "
"6604440","6607460"," Watching a little bit of a base forming on the VIX right now."
"6611930","6613530"," Make sure you have some tight stops here."
"6613670","6618370"," Make sure that you have some, has some wrist controls going on right here. "
"6619390","6620590"," We could roll this over here."
"6621890","6623270"," I know it says we're going up here."
"6623670","6626530"," If you see my cursor, it says we're going up here, but this looks like a bull trap. "
"6635440","6638620"," XLK, I want to bring you over to XLK real quick and just show you this."
"6639220","6640620"," Tight stops right now, okay guys."
"6641620","6645200"," I want you to see that we're testing right here. "
"6645340","6649660"," We have a little bit more room up here to close, but I want you to notice right here."
"6650220","6658940"," A little bit more squeezability here, but even so, you can see we're testing already."
"6659340","6661000"," This is right here in this previous row. "
"6661680","6663880"," Just dip down below and then we shot back up."
"6664400","6665740"," A bounce, a bounce, a bounce."
"6666660","6668520"," We'll see if we can squeeze it up higher right now. "
"6668660","6670200"," See if we can get this last little bit here."
"6671460","6674060"," See if we can get, see if we can get just up in here."
"6674460","6677700"," And you can actually see it on better on XLK. "
"6679320","6681000"," A little bit more room right here."
"6681200","6683220"," You see that room that we have to go on XLK."
"6683780","6685440"," So I'm holding long here. "
"6689760","6691840"," See if we can see if we can get this push up higher."
"6699460","6700780"," I'm about to get stopped out again."
"6701000","6701080"," Nope. "
"6702220","6703080"," Close, close, close."
"6704460","6706460"," I'm going to lower my fucking stops to two bucks."
"6710110","6711490"," I don't want to get stopped out this time. "
"6714250","6715050"," I'll take the risk."
"6715730","6717030"," It's not out of two dollars and a stop."
"6717550","6720330"," Looks like it's going to roll over, but I want to see this push. "
"6721050","6722290"," I want to see this push higher."
"6732080","6732920"," Hey, thanks Marcus."
"6732920","6733680"," I appreciate it. "
"6736710","6737670"," Yeah, it's a good day, right?"
"6737810","6737930"," Arms."
"6743310","6745930"," Did I see Mike Wilson calling for a brief rally?"
"6746390","6747910"," Yeah, I'm not anti a brief rally."
"6752760","6755820"," Wiki, did you post on your, did you post for Mike Wilson piece?"
"6757240","6761780"," I always feel like when Mike Wilson says something, I'll check that out. "
"6762240","6765740"," I always feel like when Mike Wilson says something like that, it happens like a week or two later."
"6766480","6767980"," I feel like it's never like that week."
"6768800","6772920"," I trust him when he says that stuff, but it's usually not the same day. "
"6773140","6775620"," We're getting a little bit of a roll right now, a little bit of a bid in the vix."
"6778510","6779790"," I'm still wrong right now."
"6780030","6780590"," I'm not down. "
"6780770","6782090"," I'm up 20 cents, I think."
"6783670","6784670"," I'm up now."
"6784670","6785490"," I'm flat right now. "
"6787370","6788690"," And I'm about to get stopped."
"6788830","6789610"," I just got stopped out."
"6790590","6792030"," So I didn't make anything on that trade. "
"6792290","6792390"," Nothing."
"6796590","6797590"," I'm flat once again."
"6798850","6803190"," I like, I think Mike Wilson calls it pretty well, but it, whatever Mike Wilson calls something,"
"6803290","6805150"," it's usually a week or two later to be conscious of that. "
"6810030","6813290"," Yeah, he, it takes, he usually takes like a week or two for his ship to come true."
"6815730","6819970"," He'll call like a rollover in the market and the market will fucking blast off for fucking a"
"6819970","6820350"," hundred points."
"6821110","6823570"," And then it dumps like 300 points or something like that. "
"6826330","6829510"," Any tips on trading a small account and trying to get $25,000?"
"6829890","6831250"," Yes, I have a tip for that."
"6831810","6835150"," Steven, if any of you guys are listening out there and you have a small account and you want to"
"6835150","6839230"," know how to make money with a small account, we can do a quick brief tutorial."
"6840710","6850690"," I was going to do, I was, my intent was to do a challenge, but I'm running into some, I'm"
"6850690","6857750"," running, I'm running into some legal questions if I can actually run that challenge because it"
"6857750","6861070"," could be financial advice. "
"6866150","6872670"," If you're a bull, you can build a small account below $25,000."
"6874050","6875910"," Let's start with number one."
"6877090","6879670"," I'm going to start you with number one, okay?"
"6880710","6886310"," If you're an investor, stock investor, if you're an options trader, it doesn't matter. "
"6888150","6893150"," We're going to go to, I'm going to show you guys, I'm going to direct you, if you don't know"
"6893150","6894670"," how to trade spreads."
"6896190","6902290"," There are better places to trade spreads, but I implore you to learn how to place those trades,"
"6903190","6906210"," whether you're paper trading them to practice."
"6907290","6913430"," If you need help from somebody, reach out to somebody on Discord or on Twitter, ask somebody for"
"6913430","6914150"," their phone number. "
"6915070","6918730"," If you're like, watch a YouTube video and you can't wrap your head around the mechanics of that"
"6918730","6921090"," trade, you can do that."
"6921250","6930930"," Another way you can do this is go to options.ai, I think it's options.ai.com, and they have"
"6930930","6935790"," some very easy ways to, so we're rolling over right now, we're going to stop this conversation real"
"6935790","6936010"," quick."
"6936010","6944190"," So as we roll over right here, we're going to look for where we should put, look for some support"
"6944190","6944470"," below. "
"6946550","6949970"," We're going to follow this trend line right here that I put in, right?"
"6950490","6953850"," So I move these trend lines up and then this one trend line right here, I'm going to watch it"
"6953850","6954330"," again, right?"
"6955130","6956030"," So why am I doing that?"
"6956650","6958850"," I'm doing that because I want to see if we can form another bull flag."
"6958850","6963910"," If I rolled this up, we could be forming a larger bull flag, you already know that below we have"
"6963910","6964510"," some support."
"6965150","6969630"," You can see 376.30, somewhere down in here, right?"
"6969970","6972570"," Someone expect us we could possibly trade down here. "
"6972870","6976770"," We also have the VWAP sitting down here, so we're going to just pay attention to this as it forms"
"6976770","6980530"," and see if there's some more weakness, maybe for a rip higher."
"6981230","6984270"," So it would be something like this over here, right?"
"6984830","6987290"," If we get that failure, we end up getting this failure here."
"6987470","6990550"," So we're going to look lower to see where buyers are at, right?"
"6990670","6995890"," We're looking for where demand is right now, and we knew some supply was above here, and we're"
"6995890","6999970"," going to look to see if there's any demand down below or if demand goes lower and lower. "
"7000310","7003210"," On the right-hand side of your screen, I don't know if you were looking at the right-hand side"
"7003210","7008530"," of your screen, but down here, you see this gray area in this white area, it says, this is yellow,"
"7008730","7015210"," it says, hey, I want to buy fucking spy right here at 376.17. It's that yellow line."
"7015570","7020350"," Now, if you start to see white pop in down here, lower and lower, it's going to try to lead"
"7020350","7021470"," the price even lower."
"7022490","7027510"," So so far right now, we still have this supply above. "
"7028110","7032350"," It's good to see if this hasn't gone away, so we're going to keep that above there, and you're"
"7032350","7033130"," going to see this 376."
"7033810","7035210"," Yeah, it's popping lower to VWAP now."
"7036070","7040790"," These are algorithms that will lead a price lower, believe it or not. "
"7040930","7046190"," You can actually see another one down here now, 374.75. Do we always get down to where those algos"
"7046190","7046310"," go?"
"7046510","7050270"," No, but they will drag the price down to where they want to actually buy."
"7050670","7052250"," These are called stink bids sometimes."
"7052990","7059170"," There are fake bids in the market put in large orders, and they don't actually execute them, but it"
"7059170","7064470"," attracts the price lower to where they actually do want to buy, for whatever algorithm that they"
"7064470","7066550"," have that says, I can make money in this trade. "
"7067630","7068990"," Anyways, back to the story."
"7069350","7073010"," So if you're a new trader, new investor, how do you make money?"
"7073350","7074250"," Well, especially if you're a bull."
"7075070","7076390"," There's an easy way to do that. "
"7077250","7085730"," Now, there are riskier ways to execute these trades, but the safest way, safest way is to place"
"7085730","7087610"," anywhere from 9 to 13 trades a year."
"7087610","7089510"," I've gone through this before, 9 to 13 trades a year."
"7089630","7093230"," Make them call spreads, debit call spreads specifically. "
"7094670","7097590"," And make sure it's on the spy because it settles the cash."
"7099490","7102770"," If you do it on a ticker, this is more complicated than needs to be."
"7103050","7105530"," Just do the spy, trade the spy. "
"7106710","7108030"," There's a bunch of reasons for this."
"7108190","7109610"," Try not to do it around a dividend date."
"7110230","7111210"," It closes the cash. "
"7111450","7116270"," There's no issues with them with you getting really super uber fucked."
"7117790","7119730"," If your positions are closed early."
"7121930","7124250"," So what I want to talk to you about is just how to build an account. "
"7126150","7128450"," You need to learn how to place a debit call spread."
"7129410","7132030"," If you can't figure that out in your own, you have to call somebody."
"7132670","7133330"," Text somebody. "
"7133870","7134350"," Tweet somebody."
"7134990","7135290"," Anybody."
"7135470","7137010"," Find someone that can show you how to place one. "
"7137810","7141250"," If all else fails, you can go to a website called optionsai.com."
"7141470","7142710"," I don't like executing trades there."
"7142710","7146570"," I don't like trading there, but it's a basic easy way for you to make that trade."
"7147750","7151110"," You just follow one of their videos and it'll show you how to place that trade. "
"7152310","7158190"," In a perfect world, I would recommend to you to place your trades on tasty."
"7158670","7161070"," I want to tell you why."
"7162570","7164290"," This is how I found tasty, believe it or not. "
"7165830","7169070"," So tasty, you can make accounts."
"7169090","7174690"," You can make fucking 30 accounts, 100 accounts under your social security number."
"7175490","7183210"," If you blow one up with day trades, you can move your money from one account to the next one. "
"7183450","7189510"," So if you're trading under a $25,000 account and you make five day trades, which I recommend that"
"7189510","7190470"," you do if you're going to lose."
"7190470","7195990"," So the rules are based upon you losing all your money, believe it or not."
"7196550","7198910"," You should never be trained to stay in bad positions. "
"7199690","7202210"," You should always exit those positions whenever you can."
"7202430","7203410"," That's a whole nother conversation."
"7204250","7207230"," Whole nother fucking discussion that I should make a video about. "
"7208050","7213070"," But basically, you want to build an account, start with call spreads."
"7214530","7216710"," I'm going to bring something up right now."
"7222040","7223080"," Start with call spreads. "
"7223720","7228860"," If you make a few of a thousand bucks, you can turn a thousand dollars into a million dollars."
"7228860","7230160"," You make 10 of these in a row."
"7231480","7234720"," I know you guys don't believe me in this, but it is very true. "
"7235640","7236520"," Very easy to do."
"7239020","7240300"," Easiest way to build an account."
"7242020","7243920"," No brainer way to build an account. "
"7247650","7249190"," Let me clear all this out here."
"7249310","7249690"," Give me a second."
"7249730","7250850"," I'm going to do it on ES here. "
"7251130","7252210"," We'll do the spot."
"7254310","7256550"," Make it simple, easy, and direct."
"7262170","7262590"," Drawings. "
"7262990","7263250"," Okay."
"7265150","7266850"," So I'm going to weakness the market right now."
"7267310","7268010"," Thankfully, I got out. "
"7268430","7278290"," I want you to look at the look down here at 375.51. This will make this 375.51 right"
"7278290","7279050"," here at VWAP."
"7281310","7284930"," And we're going to see if we continue to trade down to this 375."
"7285490","7286610"," We get some support down here. "
"7287010","7288210"," Meanwhile, this is what we're going to do."
"7289370","7290450"," We try to build an account."
"7291110","7294710"," So I'm going to go to Tasty because you can, you can, let's start with the rules. "
"7295010","7296230"," Like number fucking one."
"7297310","7300110"," All these rules are in place for you to actually lose money."
"7300530","7305570"," They're implying that you should know, you should be, you should know your trade before you ever"
"7305570","7306250"," get into it. "
"7306770","7307390"," Your thesis."
"7307690","7310030"," You should keep a journal and it should be successful."
"7310690","7313330"," And if it's not, you're doing something wrong. "
"7313450","7314030"," That's not true."
"7314710","7315850"," That's, that's a fucking lie."
"7316970","7321550"," You have to make sure your position to like rule number one is if you position yourself and you're"
"7321550","7323050"," like this theory of where you're going. "
"7324450","7326690"," This is a whole nother fucking video."
"7326870","7327730"," I'm not going to do this one right now."
"7327750","7328530"," I'm going to stay out of this conversation. "
"7329370","7334930"," The brief, the brief point I'm trying to make is if you get caught off sides, you only have a"
"7334930","7335430"," few options."
"7335430","7338850"," Add to your position, cut it loose or double down, right?"
"7339030","7339390"," Have that right?"
"7339690","7344350"," Cut it loose, double down or just stay in your current position."
"7344610","7345230"," That's number three. "
"7345730","7351450"," Because sometimes your position can look untenable and you would have gotten paid, believe it or"
"7351450","7351590"," not."
"7351710","7352590"," Or at least broken even."
"7352970","7353790"," So that's a whole nother video. "
"7355030","7357910"," So you should actually be taught that as a new trader, new investor."
"7358990","7360050"," And you're not, of course."
"7361350","7367510"," You're also never taught as a new, new trader, new investor how to hedge properly for free. "
"7368150","7369470"," So that's another problem."
"7372250","7376990"," So no matter if you're day trading, investing or whatever, you can hedge positions for free."
"7377150","7381830"," You can actually make money even in a hedge if the stock market goes up, believe it or not. "
"7381830","7385190"," Those are called ratio spreads, also known as putback spreads."
"7385810","7387910"," Write that down in a piece of paper and look up on your own."
"7388030","7389230"," They're very simple and easy to do. "
"7390230","7393830"," If the market goes up, you'll actually break even or slightly make more money."
"7394730","7395670"," Those are free trades."
"7395910","7396370"," That's insurance. "
"7397190","7398270"," Cost of doing business."
"7398710","7399750"," Now all that shit out of the way."
"7402850","7406030"," You can apply this to, you can apply this. "
"7406330","7410350"," I want to tell you to like zero dates and weeklies and monthlies as well."
"7411090","7411890"," There's more risk."
"7412010","7414850"," But if you got risk free, how to grow an account, I'm going to show you quickly. "
"7415090","7415690"," It's very simple."
"7417030","7417670"," It's fucking simple."
"7419750","7420850"," This is the S&P 500. "
"7421090","7421430"," This is fine."
"7422550","7424950"," S&P 500 has been going down since January."
"7425230","7425730"," It's terrible. "
"7426910","7429030"," You might say you can't be a bro on this market."
"7429210","7430270"," You can't make money in this market."
"7430710","7432890"," There's a lot of people in this room that are listening to me right now. "
"7432890","7435350"," I've already heard this fucking spill to make this fast."
"7436530","7438870"," Get yourself trading view, sign up for trading view."
"7439590","7440190"," Go back. "
"7440710","7442350"," It's 12, 13 in the afternoon."
"7442950","7443950"," Come back and watch this later."
"7445130","7445710"," Look up. "
"7445830","7446530"," Market breadth indicator."
"7451620","7452840"," It's about Iceman Rand."
"7453040","7453540"," Put it on there. "
"7453900","7454580"," There's other indicators."
"7454940","7456120"," There's a whole bunch of other stuff you can look at."
"7456880","7460460"," But I can give a fine fuck about any of that. "
"7461160","7462040"," I'm going to get rid of this."
"7462360","7463520"," Get rid of that right there."
"7464180","7465680"," We're going to let this load up right now. "
"7465760","7467880"," It's going to take a minute because I'm live streaming right now."
"7467880","7469580"," It's going to take a minute for this to load up."
"7469800","7472300"," I'm going to move this to the side as it loads up right now. "
"7472760","7474140"," I'll bring it back here in just a minute."
"7475620","7476420"," We're going to load this."
"7476540","7477240"," We're going to load this stuff. "
"7477340","7479340"," We're going to look at it over the past couple of years."
"7480040","7480420"," Here we go."
"7481640","7483140"," We're going to bounce right now in the spot. "
"7483860","7484800"," The buyer's stepping in."
"7484940","7485680"," I think it's a false bounce."
"7486980","7488020"," Personally, I'm not going to buy that. "
"7488080","7489020"," I want to buy this down below."
"7489500","7490980"," I want to make sure this holds as well."
"7493440","7493980"," We're just taking care. "
"7494020","7494640"," I want to take the picks."
"7496140","7497060"," Next is curling over."
"7497240","7498180"," I think it's rolling a little bit. "
"7498180","7499500"," It could be a nice buy here."
"7501100","7502720"," This might be a good place to buy."
"7503880","7508660"," While this happens, while the squeeze takes place, I'm going to go over this real quick so it gets"
"7508660","7509200"," out of the way. "
"7509940","7512080"," For the new traders out there, new investors out there."
"7513540","7514780"," This is the market breadth indicator."
"7516320","7520660"," I want you to see the red line up here and the green line down below. "
"7521120","7522320"," I hate MacD and I hate."
"7522960","7524100"," Vwop is actually not bad."
"7525000","7526960"," Vwop actually works, believe it or not. "
"7526960","7529160"," People like to make fun of breadth indicators."
"7529480","7531880"," This is a breadth indicator of the entire SP500."
"7532680","7540700"," It actually shows when it shows individual sectors and when they have been completely sold. "
"7541420","7547760"," You can see down here, right, where my chart line, where my pointer lines up here, right, that the"
"7547760","7549720"," market sold off and it was at rock bottom."
"7550820","7558460"," You could safely buy a call spread that pays 100% down here with enough time on it that it"
"7558460","7559380"," would print at some point."
"7560000","7563160"," You can see that, yes, in fact, you would have printed a call spread here. "
"7563980","7565800"," Now, that doesn't always happen."
"7565960","7566560"," Sometimes it does."
"7566700","7567860"," You'll see this nice little pump here. "
"7568580","7569840"," You see a nice little pump right here."
"7569980","7575000"," I'm just going to change this to a cross so you can see actually where this happens."
"7576300","7577860"," You can see there's a nice pump down below here. "
"7577860","7581020"," Every time you get down here, but the key ones are when it's really bad."
"7581440","7585500"," When you see really bad stuff, you know that eventually it's going to come back every time."
"7586040","7588880"," This has now the only times you would have lost this trade ever. "
"7589020","7591600"," This isn't a bear market and you can still make money this way."
"7592120","7598080"," This is a bull market and you can see how often it's, do we still had bottoms down here, right?"
"7598840","7599580"," We had one right here."
"7599640","7601440"," If you put enough time on it, it's going to print. "
"7601900","7604660"," So that would mean if you're going to buy a call spread, it should be one to three months out."
"7606680","7608780"," Right anywhere down here, you see one right here."
"7609540","7610460"," See one right here. "
"7610600","7613000"," Matter of fact, let's go back to March 2020."
"7614240","7618700"," You actually had, if you had, if you hadn't known any about this stuff down here, had you bought"
"7618700","7621900"," this one, you still would have printed your call spread."
"7623060","7623180"," Okay. "
"7623360","7627880"," If you're disciplined enough where you close it out and you don't go back in and you wait, even if"
"7627880","7632440"," we go up, even to watch my hand down here, even if we go up, you don't enter again."
"7632580","7634080"," You just wait for the next fall down."
"7634660","7638700"," So if it fails like it did here, you would still be successful with enough time. "
"7638800","7639700"," You would have captured this."
"7640060","7644760"," Now, meanwhile, all these other jokers out there are like, well, you missed all this here and you"
"7644760","7645580"," missed all this here."
"7645960","7650840"," The reality is, if you're a disciplined investor and disciplined trader, you would consistently"
"7650840","7653520"," make nine out of 10 trades making this trade. "
"7653960","7659500"," Now, if you want to make a 10 out of 10 trades because you're building an account, you need to"
"7659500","7661820"," go in 100% of the time with 100% of your money."
"7662140","7663340"," This is not financial advice."
"7664740","7666980"," And you need to stick to your fucking rules. "
"7667560","7671560"," I have say this, nobody ever does every time we come on these bottoms."
"7671660","7675760"," People say to me, well, Cap, I just want to buy zero dates or buy weeklies or whatever."
"7676140","7676760"," That's fine. "
"7677160","7682980"," But I'm saying if you're a disciplined investor that needs to make consistent money every time"
"7682980","7683700"," we're down here."
"7684700","7689700"," This is how then this is still to this day how I make enough money to day trade is by"
"7689700","7690160"," these trades."
"7690500","7692760"," Every time we're down here, no matter when it was down here. "
"7693480","7695540"," Down here again, down here again."
"7695580","7698200"," They usually present themselves nine to 13 times a year."
"7698640","7700420"," Have another one down in here, right?"
"7700840","7702720"," Have another one down in here right here. "
"7702880","7703520"," You got it, right?"
"7704140","7706620"," Another tag down below below was 270."
"7707420","7708680"," The high was 280."
"7709660","7712120"," If you had put enough time on it, it didn't print for you. "
"7712500","7714280"," You still would have got it up here, right?"
"7714620","7718120"," You would have at least been able to unfuck yourself at some point and save your trade."
"7718900","7721060"," You see, maybe you're getting my point at least, right?"
"7721060","7722700"," You pull it in the money call."
"7723000","7728160"," If we're down here, let's say 270, if you get the 270, 280, then you continue on. "
"7728720","7730840"," There are some times you can't lose these trades."
"7732400","7734120"," They're not 100% of the time."
"7734900","7737960"," But generally speaking with enough time on them, they do tend to print. "
"7738640","7740100"," So if you're like, I want to build an account cap."
"7740240","7741040"," I've only got 10 grand."
"7742320","7748560"," A nice account is probably 100, like a working account is anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000. "
"7748560","7749980"," Somewhere in there."
"7751560","7753140"," You don't need a million fucking dollars."
"7753520","7756920"," You just need to build that account to about $102,000 to $300,000. "
"7757020","7757560"," Somewhere in there."
"7758140","7759600"," I'm going to stress this again."
"7760160","7765400"," If you, let's say you make all this money, you turn 10 grand to 30 grand into $100,000 to"
"7765400","7768140"," $300,000, or even $25,000, $10,000. "
"7768960","7772420"," Let's say you make eight great trades, seven great trades, and you're at a half million."
"7773720","7775380"," Don't fucking trade that money."
"7776100","7778960"," Only trade that $100,000 to $300,000, right?"
"7779340","7783940"," Take the rest of that fucking money and buy something that only fucking goes up. "
"7784540","7787280"," I don't care if it's buying a low on the S&P 500."
"7787660","7788820"," I don't care if it's buying a house."
"7789440","7791460"," Better yet, buy some commercial property. "
"7792060","7794720"," Buy something that fucking goes up in value."
"7794960","7798040"," Don't go buying fucking trucks that fucking for 120 grand."
"7798840","7799740"," Don't go do that shit. "
"7801960","7803260"," That depreciate over time."
"7803600","7804700"," And you use something like this."
"7805020","7809400"," And this over time, you could shut Twitter off shut fucking Wall Street bets off shut. "
"7810040","7811840"," Stank Twits or not, whatever they're called."
"7812040","7812520"," Stock Twits."
"7812900","7813360"," Is that them?"
"7813500","7813540"," Yeah. "
"7814140","7814980"," Turn off Bloomberg."
"7815560","7820140"," Turn off CNBC and just be patient and check in on this chart right here."
"7820820","7822120"," And this is going to pay every time. "
"7822820","7824020"," Every single fucking time."
"7824880","7829520"," You just buy some calls that are a month out in the money and they're going to print."
"7829520","7831320"," Every single time. "
"7831520","7832300"," I don't fucking care."
"7832660","7834460"," The fucking stock market shifts the bed."
"7834820","7836240"," Three hundred points in one fucking day. "
"7836560","7840320"," Because you're just waiting for this low signal to this green area down here that shows green."
"7840640","7841700"," See that green down there?"
"7842180","7843280"," Buy yourself some call spreads."
"7844260","7845140"," Let them run until they print. "
"7845520","7845960"," Close them out."
"7846600","7847540"," Don't talk about them."
"7847640","7848620"," Keep them in a separate account. "
"7850140","7851340"," And that's all you do."
"7851820","7852880"," It's that fucking simple."
"7853780","7855500"," It really is that fucking simple. "
"7856320","7861100"," And that's when I own stock, when I do spreads and when I day trade, those are all separate"
"7861100","7861480"," accounts."
"7862360","7863680"," Keep all that shit separate."
"7863860","7865340"," Don't keep them in the same fucking place. "
"7865940","7867540"," Don't fucking trade in that same account."
"7867900","7873440"," The reason I say that to you is because it's hard to have discipline when you're looking at it"
"7873440","7874020"," every day."
"7874160","7880000"," It's better to have like a chart on trading view or Webull. "
"7880500","7881440"," I'm going to show you."
"7881440","7883520"," I don't know if you get some of your new traders probably don't know this."
"7883640","7885720"," But you can go like right into Webull here. "
"7886860","7888460"," See this line right here in the VIX?"
"7888660","7889600"," I can right click on it."
"7889940","7890860"," I can create an alert."
"7891560","7891820"," Okay?"
"7892400","7893180"," I haven't signed in. "
"7893740","7895340"," I have a signed in Webull somewhere."
"7895600","7896620"," I had another computer over here."
"7896760","7899100"," But you can just set an alert. "
"7900860","7907000"," You can literally set an alert for when to sell your spreads so that you don't have to watch the"
"7907000","7907600"," stock market."
"7907600","7909480"," I'm trading up now and higher."
"7909820","7912180"," If you're $7,839, nice little push up higher here. "
"7912680","7914380"," VIX is starting to head higher as well."
"7915480","7921120"," We're looking for $3.81 and then $3.24 above."
"7921880","7926860"," So we've got $3.81. We're going to move this higher, $3.81. Nice and big. "
"7927420","7927800"," That's huge."
"7928080","7928920"," Let's check this one more time."
"7929680","7936260"," $3.79.42. Huge moves in the spy right here. "
"7938530","7939790"," Huge moves in the spy."
"7944170","7945290"," Move this one up here."
"7946350","7947110"," That large target. "
"7950450","7953990"," So, like I have an account in front of me right now, right?"
"7954130","7955270"," This is my day trading account."
"7955550","7957850"," This is all I fucking do in this account is day trade."
"7958610","7963650"," If I don't fuck around with anything else in this account, my spreads that I buy, I don't fucking"
"7963650","7964370"," look at them. "
"7965210","7966850"," I don't look at them."
"7966930","7969950"," I don't fuck with them."
"7969950","7972070"," They usually hold them right to the end. "
"7972330","7973330"," To the bitter fucking end."
"7973950","7975250"," That's put end call spreads."
"7975810","7976990"," You can see it today with JPM. "
"7977710","7979790"," They hold their spreads right to the bitter fucking end."
"7980210","7982250"," You ever noticed in the market during OPEXES?"
"7982870","7986250"," We trade to a number and we kind of like stay there."
"7986890","7987910"," Yep, that pin in the market. "
"7988230","7991950"," That pin is because of the spreads that are out there bred by larger banks out there."
"7992430","7996050"," So anyways, the point I'm trying to make mine, all this bullshit that I'm talking to you about is"
"7996510","8001070"," if you want to build an account, you're going to learn how to trade spreads have to."
"8001370","8003430"," It's going to be the fastest way you can build an account. "
"8003610","8007810"," It's faster than any kind of stock buying will build an account for you."
"8008070","8013630"," It's safer than any kind of just naked options or calls, naked puts or calls."
"8014210","8017390"," I don't know if it's usually naked calls or just owning calls. "
"8021550","8027890"," The best thing for you to do is buy some spreads on a breadth indicator saying the market is just"
"8027890","8029990"," overextended on the downside."
"8030950","8035710"," It's going to be bought by banks, going to be bought by algorithms no matter what."
"8037690","8041430"," If you put enough time on those spreads, they're going to print. "
"8041770","8042730"," They're going to fucking print."
"8043150","8048490"," Now, if you can't find a spread that's going to pay you 100% in a month or three months,"
"8048590","8051230"," you have to decide for yourself what risk you take, not financial advice."
"8052010","8056650"," If you want to just buy in the money calls that are one month out or three weeks out or"
"8056650","8061130"," two weeks out or you're just going to buy zero dates or some shit like that, not financial advice. "
"8062170","8067670"," But if you do that, you're going to make consistent money in this market."
"8067830","8070630"," No matter what anybody tells you, it doesn't matter if it's a bull market or a bear market and it"
"8070630","8071410"," doesn't mean shit."
"8072570","8073990"," It doesn't mean shit. "
"8074450","8084370"," Trading up higher now, 37866, looking for 37944, 38092, and 382 15, just pushing it"
"8084370","8084890"," higher now."
"8085310","8089110"," Breaking through some of them, sellers, sellers are weak right now in the market."
"8089750","8092350"," 3D season up to $2.32 currently. "
"8093110","8095890"," Squeeze it higher and higher and higher and higher."
"8097790","8102090"," We got a tag above here, 3D37, 38116."
"8103110","8107730"," I always miss these fucking trades when I go up on a tangent trying to do a mini class in"
"8107730","8108750"," the middle of a fucking session. "
"8108750","8109910"," I'm kind of pissed right now."
"8112430","8114250"," Kind of pissed that I missed that trade."
"8116670","8120010"," 3DC is up to $2.45. Beautiful trade right there. "
"8121690","8122730"," So that's the thing."
"8122810","8128490"," If you're trying to build an account, spreads, market breadth indicator, set them, forget them."
"8130050","8132330"," I don't know how much money you should do on those trades. "
"8133950","8136630"," But if you're trying to build an account, you got like a thousand bucks."
"8138550","8140170"," Let's say if you're like, let's say I'm a job."
"8140410","8140790"," This is terrible. "
"8140970","8141870"," I shouldn't be saying this stuff."
"8142150","8144710"," This is like definitely not financial advice."
"8146890","8153750"," Beautiful trade right now on the spy, heading higher at $3.7961, $3.7971. Cranking on the spy right"
"8153750","8156810"," now, just blasting away at the ceiling. "
"8158070","8162390"," Price target above $3.22. Way up here."
"8163390","8164710"," Let's see if we can push it even higher."
"8165890","8166410"," Fuck. "
"8166670","8167830"," I can't believe I'm not in this trade."
"8170470","8171410"," Fucking pissed."
"8172910","8175490"," Beautiful cost factor coming in the options chain right now. "
"8176810","8177810"," This is hilarious."
"8179110","8179630"," Gorgeous."
"8179890","8183590"," 3DC is up to $2.85 blasting away. "
"8184530","8185110"," Crushing it."
"8185830","8187010"," Crushing it right now."
"8187910","8193889"," With a bit of supply coming in above at 3.14. A little bit of supply up in here. "
"8193889","8195010"," We'll extend this a little bit higher."
"8196389","8199250"," 3.14 right in here."
"8200930","8208389"," So anyways, I came in blasting, but instead I got took away to talk about how to build an account. "
"8211690","8213190"," So that's how you do it."
"8213790","8216290"," This is one of the ones I want to say is if you're a guy out there and you take"
"8216290","8217730"," a job, you're working."
"8218309","8220830"," Say you make $500 a week or $1,000 a week. "
"8220830","8224250"," You got nothing to lose doing that trade, believe it or not."
"8224690","8230950"," You just go to your job, get your $1,000 right, and you just bank that $1,000 every single"
"8230950","8233730"," week until you see that market breadth indicator go down."
"8234530","8237770"," When you do, buy yourself some fucking call spreads with a month on them. "
"8238410","8239469"," Close your fucking laptop."
"8239969","8240830"," Close your fucking phone."
"8242090","8243730"," I'm being figurative here. "
"8245549","8247070"," And take that trade."
"8247889","8248990"," And don't listen to anybody."
"8248990","8250570"," That's the hardest part of the trade. "
"8251969","8253170"," Don't listen to the doom gloom."
"8253510","8254190"," Don't listen to your friends."
"8255290","8256290"," Don't listen to CNBC. "
"8257930","8266469"," Don't listen to Mike fucking whatever his name is from a fucking, don't listen to fucking Dalai"
"8266469","8266969"," Lama."
"8267610","8268950"," Don't listen to fucking anybody."
"8270809","8273150"," Just place that trade, let it ride. "
"8273930","8278209"," When you double that money, because you started out with $500,000 bucks, it's all fucking funny"
"8278209","8278670"," money anyways."
"8279750","8283490"," And I think in like five or eight trades, you can make at least a couple hundred grand."
"8283990","8285250"," And when will you do something like that?"
"8285410","8286110"," Be more conservative. "
"8286809","8290230"," Don't be going 100% all in, all in, all in, all in, all in every time."
"8290389","8291670"," Because you are going to lose one."
"8292129","8296969"," You're more than likely going to doing that specific trade on average, you're going to lose, on"
"8296969","8299930"," average, you lose one of ten trades. "
"8300830","8310870"," If you time it wrong, if you time it wrong, if you time it wrong, don't"
"8310870","8312110"," put enough time on it."
"8312330","8314250"," If you don't put enough time on it, if you time it wrong, don't put enough time on it."
"8314469","8319510"," If you can't, if you don't know how to learn how to identify an actual bottom, that can impact your"
"8319510","8319709"," wins. "
"8320430","8322150"," And you don't have to hold it for 100%."
"8322610","8327889"," If you just hold it for like 50%, you know, and if you start making enough bank, you only need"
"8327889","8330209"," to hold them for 30%, 10%."
"8330950","8335910"," And then if you start making Big Bank, come back to me and I'll tell you what to do next,"
"8336070","8342350"," because your next step is to buy, like right now you should be buying the spy, I have physical spy"
"8342350","8346450"," right now, and you sell calls and puts. "
"8346870","8350430"," When you start to make enough money, you really want to own the spy really cheap."
"8351570","8354870"," You can fuck around with Tesla, you can fuck around with Apple, whatever you want to do."
"8354969","8360150"," But the real truth of the matter is you want to own the spy on a very unblows, deep blows,"
"8360370","8361969"," like 360, 320, 260. "
"8362309","8362990"," You want to own the spy."
"8362990","8368709"," And then you want to sell puts and calls with lots of money."
"8368969","8374629"," Like if you have one to five million dollars and you just start selling calls and puts, you're"
"8374629","8377530"," going to make some nice fat bank better than any dividend out there. "
"8381690","8385670"," And that's how you make money when you may, after you're done making a lot of money."
"8387209","8390850"," See like stages as an investor and as a trader."
"8392130","8393570"," How do you actually make money in this market?"
"8393810","8396010"," Don't fucking believe that bears make all the money in this market. "
"8396030","8397870"," It's a crock of fucking shit."
"8398450","8401390"," Any guys out there that think, I want to know, I want to tell you guys something."
"8402230","8403690"," I'm going to show you guys something right here. "
"8405870","8406610"," Go on here."
"8407910","8409610"," It's a beautiful fucking trade, man."
"8409790","8410510"," That pissed me off. "
"8412770","8415370"," I want to tell you for fucking shit sure, right?"
"8425570","8427590"," There was nobody that had puts right here."
"8428130","8429510"," Well, I had puts right here."
"8430710","8432290"," I had puts right here, believe it or not. "
"8433430","8434710"," And then I got out of them, of course."
"8434890","8436310"," I always miss these like bad extra day."
"8437270","8438110"," We're at this close. "
"8438330","8438770"," I bought some posts."
"8438890","8439810"," I even posted about it on Twitter."
"8440470","8441810"," And it went down for a brief moment. "
"8442110","8443570"," And the last drop, same thing happened."
"8443930","8444710"," Day later that we dropped."
"8445570","8447330"," But you think that bears can pull this shit. "
"8447590","8448690"," I mean, they get in here."
"8449110","8450690"," You don't really get some puts in here."
"8450870","8455310"," But if you think that bears had puts right fucking here, they're fucking lying to you. "
"8455370","8456370"," They're not traders and not investors."
"8456790","8457070"," They're lying."
"8458010","8459630"," I'm telling you, they're fucking liars. "
"8461910","8464790"," Or they're just losing every fucking, they're losing all their money."
"8465770","8468910"," So you never, somebody's always like, it's going to roll."
"8469070","8469410"," It's going to burn. "
"8469530","8470330"," It's going to burn."
"8470450","8470950"," They tell you every day."
"8471010","8471390"," It's going to burn. "
"8471910","8474150"," It's just as bad as bulls that say it's going up every day."
"8475190","8476690"," Just the same fucking character."
"8478050","8482210"," So my point to you is, though, as a bull, if you are a bull, that's how you make money"
"8482210","8483350"," consistently in this market. "
"8485170","8486850"," You can build an account that way easily."
"8486970","8490770"," It's probably the least risky way to build an account as well."
"8491830","8495490"," Even some people tell you that the least risky way is by buying stock. "
"8496070","8497110"," That's a fucking lie."
"8498530","8500070"," That's another fucking lie."
"8500890","8501430"," Huge lie. "
"8502450","8503870"," Like a whole bunch of stuff they tell you about."
"8503870","8507930"," Like financial advisors and schooling and books and all this shit."
"8508370","8511770"," People on fucking Twitter telling you like you got like baseline. "
"8512170","8512710"," You read any book."
"8512750","8516630"," They're going to tell you the safest bet is to buy a stock because it'll never go."
"8516790","8517170"," It'll never. "
"8517630","8521890"," It's rare that it's ever going to go bankrupts and lose all its money to that beautiful fucking"
"8521890","8522150"," trade."
"8522350","8523510"," Let's buy 380 29."
"8524630","8528010"," 380 C's now in the money at $3 and two cents. "
"8528850","8531390"," So the next target above is 383 32."
"8532010","8541050"," Those calls on July 1st are trading for 210 on 392 and 383 is now trading at $1.70. I"
"8541050","8543750"," still have no interest in those zero dates for today."
"8543830","8544650"," I should, but I don't. "
"8548060","8550140"," If you guys are trading zero dates, good luck to you."
"8550400","8551860"," For me personally, I'm not doing it today."
"8552600","8555860"," This whole week I have put on weeklies and Friday calls. "
"8558060","8559080"," People will trade higher."
"8559940","8560800"," We do see above."
"8560800","8563280"," We're looking at some supply above here at 382 18. "
"8564060","8567440"," So we can actually get rid of this box here."
"8567800","8568740"," I'm going to get rid of this box."
"8570180","8572740"," We're going to bring this up to 382 18. "
"8574940","8576780"," This should be the extension right up in here."
"8579980","8580740"," Hold on here."
"8581380","8583840"," And then this above here is 38297. "
"8584640","8585320"," That's up here."
"8585480","8586580"," So we'll snap a line up here."
"8587360","8589120"," We're going to bring raise this line up. "
"8598510","8603830"," We're going to raise this up here."
"8604090","8606070"," We're going to raise this up right here for you."
"8607730","8610770"," And keep an eye on the..."
"8612170","8613770"," I'll leave this one right here. "
"8614510","8615670"," Move this up as we go."
"8618050","8619450"," I'm a little squiggly line."
"8621310","8622070"," And I'll buy this down here. "
"8622070","8623910"," If I get a chance to buy in here, I will."
"8626250","8630290"," So anyone out there that tells you to buy stock is lying too."
"8630410","8633070"," You can buy a fucking stock, right?"
"8633390","8633970"," Click 10 bucks. "
"8634170","8634830"," Let's say by PVE."
"8637070","8638910"," Bed, Bath, and Beyond is a good example."
"8639210","8640850"," But you could buy a stock that's a..."
"8640850","8645370"," If you track stocks, you can go back. "
"8645830","8647790"," They say like the meme stock started a few years ago."
"8647950","8648250"," That's a lie."
"8648550","8650110"," Memes stock started 10 years ago. "
"8650110","8654930"," But you can check stocks from 20 years ago that have never come back."
"8655610","8660530"," You can actually trade penny stocks, like not real true penny stocks, but like one to three dollar"
"8660530","8663090"," stocks that fucking haven't had their time for 20 years."
"8663650","8668330"," So you could buy a stock right now that's a meme stock or a pump and stock, and it never"
"8668330","8669170"," fucking comes back. "
"8669590","8670970"," You'll sit on that shit for decades."
"8671810","8672530"," There was a..."
"8672530","8674750"," There was a marijuana stock pump."
"8675330","8676750"," I want to say five years ago. "
"8676750","8680230"," And there was a new marijuana pump that just came up the past couple of years."
"8680830","8684770"," But if you had done the original marijuana pump, you were fucking sitting with your thumb up your"
"8684770","8686570"," ass for five fucking years doing nothing."
"8687030","8690090"," So now that tells you like the least risky is buying stock. "
"8690310","8691170"," That's a fucking lie."
"8692090","8693950"," And then you can buy the wrong place of a stock."
"8694150","8695130"," That's a whole other conversation. "
"8695810","8699890"," So if you want to build an account in this market, the safest way, call spreads, market breadth"
"8699890","8705130"," indicator, on weakness in the market, that is the way."
"8705130","8713950"," The way for you to always stay in this market regardless of anything, anything that happens in this"
"8713950","8716870"," market, no matter what, World War fucking three."
"8717550","8726790"," If you use that trading plan, you will have consistent profit for the rest of your days in this"
"8726790","8727210"," market. "
"8727530","8729250"," I fucking guarantee that part."
"8729770","8731170"," Not financial advice, Captain Jim James."

"8743610","8750090"," You can also follow me at Captain's Alpha where oftentimes on Twitter people will get one side of"
"8750090","8752770"," the story, but they don't know that I'm posting elsewhere as well. "
"8753250","8754910"," They get an incomplete story on Captain James."
"8755090","8762030"," So follow me on at Captain's Alpha so you can follow the full, the full trading journey that I take"
"8762030","8762550"," with you guys."
"8762990","8767750"," So you guys have context for where we are, context of where we're going, and context to my public"
"8767750","8770610"," posts versus my private posts. "
"8771070","8773770"," So I Captain's Alpha, Captain Jim James on Twitter as well."
"8774650","8778150"," I'll see you have a forward base right here and see if you can trade this up higher."
"8779490","8782410"," Take a little bit closer to look and see what's holding this up here. "
"8782410","8787370"," We've got 378-79, so we'll move that."
"8787790","8793750"," 378-79, it's right in here, right there."
"8795170","8801910"," So we'll see if this holds, consolidates for another push higher, or if we break here, how far we"
"8801910","8802090"," go. "
"8803270","8804870"," Right now we're kind of free floating."
"8805510","8809650"," I'll take a look around and see if we're going to crash it right now."
"8809650","8810850"," I crash it but dump it. "
"8811950","8813650"," It's 12.36 in the afternoon."
"8813890","8816090"," It's time for cocaine lunch for Wall Street in New York."
"8817010","8819430"," A little bit of rejection here. "
"8819590","8822350"," I'm going to take a minute to show you the rejection that's taking place."
"8823690","8827250"," I want you to see this rejection here on XLK."
"8827550","8829990"," Broke through, close the gap, now starting to head back lower. "
"8834100","8836080"," Look for some support down below here."
"8838020","8838520"," 127."
"8839960","8843120"," XLF touched it right, pin strike just above. "
"8843420","8850640"," This is the way, so we're talking today about how to look for a price target above, how to check"
"8850640","8854760"," around the market to see where a target would be above."
"8855000","8856600"," You see this target, we struck it above."
"8857380","8863140"," You're going to then add in some trend lines here and see if it can maintain trend for a move"
"8863140","8869080"," higher into this close or if we break trend, your next stop would be naturally be the drop down"
"8869080","8869560"," below here. "
"8870320","8872940"," Just keep an eye on the market as you trade it."
"8875820","8877520"," We'll see if this holds here."
"8879480","8883480"," I'm already looking at XLK and it has some room to go down here. "
"8883740","8885600"," There's some room that we can trade below here."
"8886180","8888000"," My assumption would be that we're going to close this gap."
"8888240","8890120"," Watch my cursor right here. "
"8890120","8893560"," Watch my cursor, then go down and we're going to try to close this right here."
"8894440","8895820"," We're going to attempt to close this."
"8896700","8898920"," XLK will attempt to close this gap down below. "
"8900020","8901300"," We're going to see if we can pick up some more calls."
"8902280","8905520"," I missed the last trade, so I'm going to try to get in this trade if I can."
"8911810","8913510"," Let's see if we can buy a dip here. "
"8920170","8921950"," Oh, Stephen wants a back-to-view wrap."
"8922790","8923990"," You might not get that, Stephen."
"8927470","8928730"," I don't think you're getting that today. "
"8929350","8930430"," Just a heads up."
"8930970","8932530"," I'm going to show you guys this once more."
"8934490","8937170"," Do you see this chart right here?"
"8938230","8940350"," We'll follow my racer over here. "
"8940610","8942430"," On the left-hand side, I want you to see these puts."
"8943870","8947770"," These puts are expiring today, 6.30, 2022."
"8948830","8952210"," When these puts expire, this is the most basic thing you can think about. "
"8952210","8961110"," As these puts expire, we should go up due to dealers no longer having to hedge those puts."
"8961730","8962790"," Now, it's not huge."
"8963110","8969330"," You're not going to see a Vanna rally for three days with Vanna and Charm, but you are going to"
"8969330","8976850"," see as the tip, not always, but theoretically, you're going to see a pump into the close as this"
"8976850","8978590"," move right here, just as a heads up. "
"8978990","8980050"," See this move right here?"
"8980050","8982250"," This is not bulls."
"8982750","8985410"," This is just dealers that are helping out."
"8985690","8992270"," Dealers and calls coming in by banks are helping out with, I guess you could call Vanna and some"
"8992270","9001030"," Charm, but the Charm is just quarterly rebalancing, and then you've also got the expiry of calls"
"9001030","9003890"," into the end of today where dealers no longer have to hedge. "
"9005670","9007670"," So price target above still, 383."
"9008290","9009950"," Let's see if we can make one more pump up there."
"9010290","9013270"," If we don't make this pump now, it might get saved for end of day. "
"9013950","9015550"," So just let's take a look at end of day."
"9015770","9017210"," Let's just show where we are in relevance."
"9017950","9023050"," You might see, let me see here if I can do this real quick. "
"9023890","9024550"," Let me just take a second here."
"9026890","9028250"," So, oh no, no trend line."
"9028630","9030150"," I want a goddamn trend line. "
"9033190","9035250"," You could see something like this."
"9040090","9042310"," You could have seen a failure in here, right?"
"9042670","9044850"," And then we end up coming down, consolidating lower."
"9046770","9048530"," Not exactly this, right?"
"9049190","9053110"," But then you could see that run up to 383 at the bell over here, okay?"
"9053870","9055550"," Not always, but this is common. "
"9056370","9060370"," I just want you to know that as the day wears on, you'll see the consolidation, some failure,"
"9061150","9061310"," right?"
"9061310","9062090"," Distribution."
"9062850","9066090"," And then you'll see that last little bit of the day kicking."
"9066450","9068070"," Do I say that I think this is going to happen today?"
"9068230","9068730"," I don't know. "
"9069130","9069750"," Nobody knows."
"9070330","9072030"," Sometimes you just go straight up to the end of the day."
"9072990","9075810"," But as the day wears on, the morning trade is over. "
"9076150","9076830"," Everyone's made money."
"9077530","9079070"," You might see this failure take place."
"9080470","9084270"," And then you might not see us hit this price target here until end of day. "
"9084690","9085650"," Okay, so we'll extend this."
"9086910","9087870"," Hold on here."
"9088670","9089710"," We're going to extend this. "
"9090590","9092770"," All the way over to the end of the day right here, okay?"
"9094210","9096670"," And we're going to look down below here."
"9097490","9098330"," See if I can get this."
"9101930","9103170"," We're going to extend this here. "
"9103670","9108090"," This is VWAP coming right here."
"9110030","9114750"," And we'll extend this down below, heading into the close."
"9117930","9118450"," That's good. "
"9118570","9119450"," I think that's good enough."
"9122250","9123470"," I'll make that really small."
"9123630","9127230"," I don't like that giant fucking. "
"9128450","9131830"," We'll turn this green at your buy."
"9135040","9136280"," Does that help you guys out there?"
"9138100","9139160"," I hope it does."
"9143900","9146320"," 383 is above here, 382. "
"9147020","9148320"," Actually extend this up higher."
"9149140","9149600"," Hold on."
"9153970","9155490"," Extend that up there, 383. "
"9158030","9159410"," And there we go."
"9160970","9162150"," Vic's still selling off."
"9162770","9165330"," If we can break through, I want to say that Vic's real quick. "
"9171120","9173300"," Vic's starting to break through support down here."
"9173920","9177340"," But it is also, the Vic's also on that crossover from the other day."
"9177780","9180200"," We're back in the three minutes so you can see remember this crossover we had. "
"9181040","9182320"," You can see it trading down."
"9183080","9185300"," These are some points of concern here."
"9185920","9193960"," We want to see this continuation down though into, I really want to see that down at 26 into the"
"9193960","9194160"," end. "
"9194940","9195740"," That'd be really beautiful."
"9196640","9201860"," We're going to see it this cross here and see what happens in the market."
"9208010","9209550"," This is your price target above. "
"9223590","9224310"," There you go."
"9225410","9226230"," We're right there."
"9226930","9228750"," Price target under the day I guess you call it. "
"9231870","9233410"," You guys want something more specific."
"9234130","9234930"," Into the day right there."
"9236730","9240590"," If you're looking at my cursor right now, you can see if there's no resistance right?"
"9241310","9242130"," AKA supply. "
"9242630","9244450"," There's a little supply right here, 3898."
"9245050","9248230"," So we'll snap some lines for you guys there if you really want."
"9249810","9250410"," Hold on. "
"9250510","9252150"," I'll put some lines there for you."
"9254850","9256010"," So you've got a 380."
"9256750","9257550"," What is this one?"
"9259190","9259590"," 38106. "
"9261790","9262190"," Right."
"9262750","9263610"," Oh, wait a minute."
"9264950","9265990"," 3106 is one. "
"9267870","9269610"," Your next one is 38221."
"9274060","9275260"," You guys can do this at home."
"9275440","9277720"," You can just look at this stuff and figure it out at home. "
"9278720","9279340"," What is that?"
"9279560","9280140"," What was that last one?"
"9281420","9281820"," 38220."
"9284830","9285910"," Right there's another one."
"9287130","9288130"," And every time. "
"9288470","9289190"," So I want to show you."
"9289390","9290090"," Let me get rid of this bullshit."
"9290710","9291110"," Okay. "
"9291310","9291750"," So see this."
"9292230","9293630"," Whenever we're trending up."
"9294550","9294950"," Right. "
"9295490","9296750"," Whenever we're trending up here."
"9296770","9297030"," Right."
"9300930","9302250"," Every time we make a leg up. "
"9302850","9304010"," I'll put one of these up here."
"9304110","9305470"," So we'll start one right here."
"9305570","9305730"," Right. "
"9306370","9308210"," You saw some consolidation."
"9308550","9309890"," We're looking for this consolidation."
"9310770","9312590"," You can make this small to start out. "
"9313870","9318830"," But you're looking for this trend consolidation to consolidate until we find some support."
"9319710","9319790"," Right."
"9319990","9322630"," And then a move higher to these higher prices up here. "
"9322790","9322890"," Right."
"9323470","9325610"," We're looking to get up in this price target area above."
"9325990","9328070"," We're also looking for supply to step in. "
"9328110","9329250"," We saw it step in earlier."
"9330090","9330910"," I'm going to look above here."
"9331030","9332450"," I'm not seeing much supply here. "
"9332530","9333390"," What is that showing you?"
"9334270","9337710"," Show you that all supply is up here."
"9337910","9339850"," Showing you that this is probably the ceiling."
"9341130","9341790"," Before today. "
"9341910","9342210"," Not guaranteed."
"9342590","9343290"," But right now."
"9343770","9345250"," This is looking like the ceiling above. "
"9348220","9350360"," I'm going to buy it on a rack of twenty five of these."
"9350580","9352420"," I'm going to buy some three eighty threes here."
"9352720","9353400"," I'm switching out. "
"9353580","9354900"," I'm going to switch into three eighty threes now."
"9362710","9369050"," Oh, send the order."
"9377690","9380230"," Is this is this helping guys out there?"
"9384500","9385480"," I don't know if this helps you guys. "
"9393220","9395200"," You expect the market to frustate taters."
"9395460","9395980"," You'll find out."
"9396200","9396800"," I agree with that. "
"9397500","9401100"," Usually on a trend day, it ends right around now."
"9401800","9404780"," And like right around right around like twelve thirty to two thirty."
"9405820","9407940"," Is when they trap buyers. "
"9409360","9413740"," And we'll trade sideways consolidates and then you get that run up into the bell."
"9414060","9415280"," Could be something just like this."
"9415920","9417860"," Watch my cursor today. "
"9418440","9418760"," Not always."
"9419400","9422400"," Sometimes we'll fucking blast off in the middle of the day."
"9423040","9427360"," But if we're in trend day, it's seven out of ten trend days. "
"9428180","9429260"," It's end of the day."
"9429700","9430900"," Three out of ten trend days."
"9431880","9434160"," At a ten trend days. "
"9434360","9435960"," Let's say it's six out of ten trend days."
"9436320","9437880"," Right now we start trading sideways."
"9440750","9441830"," Two out of the ten. "
"9444110","9446450"," We'll go balls to the walls."
"9448110","9453130"," Early like right now to two to three p.m. Two of the ten."
"9455930","9459750"," We'll go balls to the walls and then sell the whole fucking thing right off. "
"9463200","9464140"," Something like that."
"9466780","9471680"," Catch a little bounce here on the VIX again."
"9473720","9476240"," A lot of open air above here. "
"9476680","9477540"," Don't keep my cursor here."
"9477620","9479280"," It's three eighty one oh nine."
"9480420","9481320"," That's right here. "
"9483840","9486700"," I'm going to look for a retest of that once more."
"9486960","9487700"," See if we can get up there."
"9487840","9490700"," If not, I'm going to put some stops on my calls here. "
"9498010","9499310"," I'm going to put some stops on calls."
"9501570","9503010"," See if you guys are doing it over here."
"9509570","9510830"," It helps right on. "
"9512650","9514530"," This should help you guys make money consistently."
"9515210","9515870"," We made money yesterday."
"9516350","9519130"," We made some serious money yesterday too. "
"9519410","9520770"," Yesterday was a sideways day."
"9523710","9528310"," You can make money consistently trading the spot."
"9528310","9530470"," Much more consistently than anywhere else. "
"9530910","9532030"," Especially right now."
"9534110","9535690"," I just got stopped out."
"9537310","9541650"," I'm out once again. "
"9542530","9544530"," I'm just floating around out here in space."
"9547710","9548890"," Middle of the day doldrums."
"9549770","9551950"," I've got some people betting that we're going to roll. "
"9552570","9554470"," See these clips right here."
"9554970","9556730"," It's just the middle of the day doldrums."
"9559290","9560530"," It's not OPEC. "
"9560850","9563050"," It's end of quarter rebalancing."
"9563550","9564970"," You can't really trust either way."
"9565690","9566390"," Let's take a look at Tesla. "
"9567030","9569970"," See Tesla bouncing off that 680 over here."
"9570130","9571130"," 684, 685."
"9571890","9574610"," We talked about this being major resistance earlier this morning. "
"9575550","9577290"," I would expect some consolidation here."
"9577430","9579930"," It's not unreasonable to be expecting some consolidation here."
"9580410","9583330"," I do want you to see that we're floating around in space right here. "
"9583570","9584270"," I want you to see this guy."
"9584270","9586430"," It's not much holding up the market right now."
"9586450","9588570"," This shows that there's no bid in the market. "
"9588690","9589730"," This shows overall."
"9590410","9594710"," This is all short covering to be aware of that price target above."
"9594810","9599910"," If we can get there on the spy today or Tesla in the day, is 700, believe it or not. "
"9600570","9604890"," It possibly be 693, 692, maybe for end of day."
"9605390","9607170"," Might not get all the way up to 700."
"9608650","9610530"," It is rebalancing day. "
"9612090","9616250"," I would do want you to be aware, though, that we can roll this over at any time."
"9616430","9617530"," Tesla's telling you that."
"9618610","9619850"," I never did look at Apple. "
"9619970","9621610"," I apologize to your wife's boyfriend."
"9621750","9622610"," I apologize, my brother."
"9623310","9624510"," It's got some room to grow, baby. "
"9625310","9625670"," Look at that."
"9626690","9627950"," Apple's got some room to move."
"9629230","9631190"," Free, free space to 150. "
"9631990","9632870"," I don't think we're getting there."
"9633250","9636730"," 144, 147, 149."
"9637190","9637710"," What does that tell you?"
"9637790","9638350"," It tells you that. "
"9638350","9642670"," You could probably reasonably buy 125 and 130."
"9644190","9646890"," As long as the market conditions allow for it."
"9647430","9648450"," There are sellers. "
"9648870","9649850"," Lots of supply, though."
"9650030","9650910"," This is what I want you to see."
"9651630","9655030"," Major supply here on Apple. "
"9655630","9657470"," This is big distribution here."
"9658090","9661290"," Looking to sell and sell Apple."
"9661610","9663450"," This might take till September, believe it or not. "
"9663450","9666630"," For August, for all the money that's in Apple."
"9667610","9669870"," It's like one of the last holdouts."
"9672090","9673830"," Let me see what it puts in that back there. "
"9682170","9689010"," Keep our eye on B WAP down below here in the spy area of interest is at the 37823."
"9691490","9691930"," 37823."
"9692210","9696770"," So we'll lower this down a little bit. "
"9696770","9697430"," Watch my cursor."
"9697690","9700830"," That's an area of interest down below to the creepy crawly all the way down."
"9702550","9704090"," And I'm not in any trades right now. "
"9704150","9705150"," I'm going to take a quick break, actually."
"9705650","9706250"," It is lunch."
"9706490","9707070"," It's 1251. "
"9707470","9709170"," I'm going to leave this up for you."
"9709190","9716210"," I'll put our news guy in the background down again for you so that you can hear somebody talking."
"9718110","9721770"," I will be back at 1251. "
"9722870","9725210"," I'll be back at 115."
"9726030","9727170"," So it's 1251."
"9728190","9729790"," There's nine minutes left to the hour. "
"9729950","9730890"," Eight minutes left to the hour."
"9731490","9734190"," So I'll be back at 115 PM."
"9734530","9737390"," I'll leave this broadcast on for you so that you can track. "
"9737830","9739710"," You can watch your options slow down here."
"9740190","9744810"," I've got the news stream on the background so you can listen to."
"9745570","9748910"," You can listen to any news that might break any kind of break news. "
"9749390","9750450"," You've got book map on."
"9750770","9753210"," You do want to be tracking this right here into the close."
"9753210","9756590"," If you want to know my expectation to what's going to happen. "
"9758130","9762550"," If you want to know my expectation is to just keep watching this down below."
"9762830","9763610"," This options flow."
"9764070","9769210"," We see big chunky calls coming in because it's end of quarter rebalancing. "
"9769490","9772030"," It's going to help the stock or the spy to go up."
"9773390","9777970"," On your own, watch the VIX for more collapsing of the VIX."
"9778770","9780570"," We could trade up right from here right now. "
"9780570","9781490"," I need to take a quick break."
"9781770","9783970"," I've been running around since like 4 AM."
"9784870","9790550"," I don't believe that, but I go to bed early and I wake up early in the morning. "
"9790870","9796070"," I have to do my research and I have to keep my wife happy and keep the kids happy and"
"9796070","9797890"," keep the freaking dogs happy."
"9798730","9801150"," And then I come on here and livestream for you guys."
"9801410","9805330"," I do want you guys to know that I'm going to try to livestream more often than I have been. "
"9807110","9809130"," So you'll have me here tomorrow."
"9809790","9812410"," I'll be livestreaming tomorrow for the last day of the market."
"9813990","9817130"," I don't know if I'll be here on the 5th. "
"9817290","9819590"," I may not be or it might be like a half day."
"9819910","9826490"," If I'm not here on the 5th, I'll make a long post on Captain's Alpha for trade that week."
"9828590","9833710"," I'll do something for the 5th if I'm not here because I'm supposed to be on vacation still until"
"9833710","9834330"," the 6th. "
"9834330","9838170"," I was supposed to be gone tomorrow, but my wife fucked up a bunch."
"9838330","9839530"," My wife didn't make them."
"9839530","9840410"," My wife doesn't fuck up. "
"9840570","9840770"," I'm sorry."
"9843410","9844710"," How do you say that nicely?"
"9846470","9849510"," I can't say your wife fucked up because wives don't make mistakes."
"9850630","9851970"," They kept me around. "
"9851970","9854650"," She kept me around so she's doing pretty well."
"9855930","9857330"," I shouldn't say that either."
"9858910","9860810"," We got this above 381. "
"9861370","9862150"," It's right here."
"9862150","9863670"," Yeah, 3107."
"9863870","9864850"," These lines are all good. "
"9864870","9865790"," These are all good to go."
"9866710","9868070"," These are all good to go right here."
"9870330","9871850"," We're supposed to leave today. "
"9872610","9873830"," We haven't left today."
"9874530","9875630"," She tried to tell me."
"9875930","9878710"," I don't know how many of you are married out there. "
"9879290","9881590"," I am as a husband."
"9882070","9882590"," I'm sorry."
"9882910","9887230"," As a husband, I'm expected to admit when I'm wrong and pay the punishment. "
"9888490","9889890"," Wives never say they're wrong."
"9891190","9893270"," Don't ever try to get your wife to admit she's wrong."
"9893630","9899730"," Always just be like, don't ask for, and don't ever ask your wife to explain shit to you. "
"9901350","9906850"," Because they're just going to fucking feel like master, master storytellers, master liars and"
"9906850","9907230"," manipulators."
"9908830","9911010"," So all you do is just say yes, dear."
"9911470","9914750"," It's a perfect response or how can I help?"
"9914750","9916110"," That helps a lot. "
"9923410","9928530"," I'm telling you, I'm telling you, you guys want to make, you want to be having a happy life?"
"9929370","9930190"," Yes, dear."
"9931090","9932390"," Just do shit for."
"9933410","9934270"," Agree with her. "
"9935250","9936490"," Fucking whatever it takes."
"9936890","9937450"," Just keep her happy."
"9941350","9943850"," You'll be a happier man in life, I promise. "
"9943850","9945610"," And especially if she has to deal with you."
"9946010","9948350"," Can you imagine having a sleep with your ass every night?"
"9949250","9951790"," I was looking at Tom Cruise, this is a fucked up story."
"9952310","9955730"," I was looking at Tom Cruise, my wife had on Mission Impossible last night. "
"9956650","9960410"," And I was like, Tom Cruise, man, he's a good looking guy and he's not a good looking guy."
"9960790","9962330"," I wouldn't want to sleep with that guy at night time."
"9964430","9967890"," So I'm like, somebody wants to sleep with you for the next 20 years. "
"9967890","9969850"," Some say yes."
"9970490","9971230"," It's just busy."
"9972290","9976490"," Every once in a while, if you're like really, really sticky about something, you're like, I'm a"
"9976490","9978650"," stickler on this, then it has some meaning. "
"9979290","9982150"," So like if that one time you're like, fuck, no, we ain't doing this."
"9982910","9984210"," Can you actually say something?"
"9984630","9985790"," It actually takes some meaning."
"9986010","9987190"," They listen to you. "
"9987690","9989550"," You could say, look, we're not doing this right now."
"9990230","9992190"," You only say that once every five minutes."
"9998330","10006090"," If you're not constantly fucking bitching and moaning, you just put your foot down and say, put my"
"10006090","10006810"," foot down on this. "
"10007310","10008390"," They'll usually listen to you."
"10009010","10010590"," They'll usually be like, you know what, fuck it."
"10010670","10011910"," I don't need to win that one fight. "
"10012690","10014130"," Don't try winning fights with your wives."

"10044000","10047160"," Like I could hang out with this person because you can't do that shit, man. "
"10047420","10048920"," You're not going to ever be able to give up fighting."
"10049160","10049840"," You're just fighting forever."
"10050660","10051960"," No reason to be fighting with people. "

"10062080","10063500"," You guys want to drink a bourbon today?"
"10064040","10065220"," I haven't had a bourbon in like a week."
"10066160","10067460"," It's almost vacation time. "
"10067580","10069180"," You guys want to have a drink heading into the end of the day?"

"10083200","10085080"," And I think we used all our lemons."
"10086020","10088660"," We lose our fruit as vacation or something like that. "
"10088820","10090920"," So I went, my daughter made lemon cream pie or something."
"10092060","10094960"," So maybe I'll do like a orange or something."
"10095800","10097460"," I don't know what kind of fruits we have right now. "
"10097540","10098080"," My kids are monsters."

"10101680","10103140"," You never have enough fruit in the house. "
"10103740","10105200"," So I'll pour a whiskey a bourbon."
"10105920","10108140"," We'll be back here for the trade at the end of the day."

"10111480","10113480"," You see the Amazon, Amazon puts coming in right now."
"10113500","10115140"," So that might lend some weakness to the market. "
"10115780","10118960"," Just as rebalancing just heads up on these Amazon puts coming in."
"10119720","10124680"," I'll be back here with you at 1.15. And we'll trade the end of the day today."

"10133630","10137370"," That's the Andreas saying something about roasting each other. "
"10137370","10143590"," Well, so first off, we can dig each other."

"10165410","10168390"," We'll be like, oh, this is how I shouldn't say my wife's name."
"10168530","10172470"," Probably what he's how Aaron does things or this is how Jim does things."
"10173630","10174870"," Or, you know, that kind of stuff. "
"10175250","10176370"," We have a lot of fun with that."

"11230660","11233880"," So if I, as a causation. "
"11236360","11237120"," Heck yes."
"11239160","11240460"," So happy for the July day."
"11240600","11241200"," Happy Juneteenth. "
"11241220","11241960"," Anybody out there?"
"11242740","11243880"," I think we said that before."
"11244120","11245060"," Happy for the July day."
"11245240","11246780"," Any of you out there that are Americans. "
"11247460","11248880"," Anyone that wants to be an American."
"11249100","11252120"," This is a civilian holiday we got coming up, right?"
"11252120","11257440"," So the Fed repo reverse use 30 usage there."
"11257600","11259980"," It's a fresh record at $2.33 trillion. "
"11261340","11267040"," So if you, so you got Memorial Day, you got Veterans Day, you got Labor Day for workers."
"11267900","11271820"," Everybody's got their day and this is the one for the United States of America."
"11271820","11275700"," I know it's got some bad connotations right now, but that's okay. "
"11277080","11278840"," I'm putting all that stuff aside."
"11279120","11280080"," This is your holiday."
"11280080","11280880"," This is my holiday. "
"11281620","11284860"," If you're a civilian out there or never been a soldier or whatever, you're just American."
"11285780","11286680"," You guys know that."
"11286840","11289000"," The Fourth of July is all about. "
"11291080","11295180"," I'm not going to get into the politics and all that kind of stuff, but this holiday is for you."
"11295460","11297420"," So chairs to you if you're an American."
"11297720","11298880"," Chairs to you if you want to be an American. "
"11299340","11300660"," Chairs to you if you're not an American."
"11301620","11305000"," And hope that Americans can be better people so we can help you out there."
"11307240","11307960"," You know what I mean?"
"11308580","11313640"," And if you're, you know, somebody else does better than Americans, hopefully we can be more like"
"11313640","11314160"," you in the future. "
"11314320","11315600"," Chairs to all you people out there too."
"11315960","11317400"," I know some people listen from other countries."
"11319120","11321480"," That's a chairs to everybody out there, whether you're American or not. "
"11322940","11325060"," So yeah, big old Fourth of July kind of this weekend."
"11325260","11326340"," So chairs to all of you out there."
"11326460","11326540"," Okay. "
"11334620","11334940"," Merka."
"11338900","11340920"," Yeah, chairs to you if you're a soldier."
"11342000","11343340"," Chairs to all of you from other countries. "
"11345800","11348500"," This is a so we're going to be celebrating our Independence Day."
"11350780","11351820"," So it's a big thing, right?"
"11353000","11357940"," We don't always live up to be in the best country we can be, but we definitely try to be."
"11360840","11361800"," Believe it or not. "
"11362160","11365660"," I know we suck sometimes at it, but the good thing."
"11365700","11370680"," We are seeing here that Ukraine receives 446.8 million euro loan from the World Bank."
"11370940","11374220"," With 424 spot, 6 million guaranteed by the UK. "
"11375000","11376460"," There's a lot, there's a lot of time ahead."
"11380240","11384320"," Chairs to anybody out there that ever helped us achieve our independence."
"11384780","11386860"," Chairs to anyone from Great Britain and England, of course. "
"11387740","11393880"," I know that can be contentious too, but chairs to France as well."
"11394280","11396820"," Any other nation that ever helped us gain our freedom."
"11399360","11400340"," That's important too. "
"11405560","11408900"," It's kind of always sometimes I think back to 4th of July."
"11409280","11415340"," I think about we get our independence from England from the UK, but then we became the greatest"
"11415340","11416240"," ally in World War II."
"11416340","11419940"," That's a big one as I showed our friendship to them. "
"11420420","11421440"," It's an important one."
"11425580","11426460"," So what do we got here?"
"11426660","11428240"," We're sitting here on some light support."
"11428240","11430400"," Chairs to all of you out there if you're listening right now. "
"11434760","11437100"," What do you guys are asking questions over here?"
"11437100","11438720"," Chairs to Canadians out there, of course."
"11439760","11440540"," Another great ally."
"11443020","11443380"," Mexico. "
"11444400","11445760"," Believe it or not, it's a great ally."
"11447560","11450380"," I'll put the Butler-Cirile for G's money still a bit loud."
"11450660","11451420"," Okay, we'll turn it back down again. "
"11452160","11455240"," I reset it so I didn't know if it..."
"11456960","11457640"," Hold on here."
"11457800","11459600"," Yeah, I might reset the volume as well."
"11460480","11461680"," I do love that name, by the way. "
"11461780","11462320"," Keep using it."
"11463900","11464920"," Whoever wrote that."
"11466060","11466860"," Who wrote that?"
"11467260","11468660"," Mr. Muddy Stone or whatever. "
"11471260","11472280"," Chairs to Puerto Ricans."
"11472880","11473900"," Chairs to all of you out there."
"11474380","11477700"," If you're not from the United States, you have your own independence day. "
"11478780","11480900"," Chairs to you for whatever your independence day is."
"11483180","11484880"," I'm going to get a nice little bounce over here."
"11484960","11486560"," You can see that nice little level of support. "
"11486880","11487840"," We mapped this out earlier."
"11488980","11492940"," I do want to only pay attention to this bar that I have right here."
"11493000","11493800"," See this one right here?"
"11494640","11495420"," I'm highlighting. "
"11496420","11501960"," I want you to look at this bar here because it can turn into a point of resistance here."
"11503680","11508820"," If you can't reclaim this trend, you would see further downside."
"11508820","11512780"," We don't reverse here or reject here. "
"11513320","11515940"," The bear is going to be watching this to see if it rejects or not."
"11518220","11520860"," To see if we have further downside ahead."
"11521280","11521880"," I don't think that we do. "
"11521980","11523400"," We've got 381 above us here."
"11524260","11525880"," Still that same target above."
"11526300","11527160"," Do you watch my cursor here?"
"11528520","11534180"," Vix is starting to rise now along with the spy. "
"11537410","11538870"," Looking at some Contango."
"11539110","11539450"," Hey, buddy."
"11541710","11542730"," Hey, Henry. "
"11543190","11543890"," Hey, good boy."
"11544470","11544990"," Come here, buddy."
"11547750","11549070"," Vix is looking to close that gap. "
"11549470","11550670"," We're going to see what happens here."
"11554860","11556780"," A little bit of Contango in the Vix."
"11557440","11559140"," Vix is trying to close that gap above. "
"11564210","11564990"," Hey, handsome."
"11565510","11566010"," Here's the boy."
"11568070","11569330"," So, cheers to you out there. "
"11569470","11570130"," Where are you from?"
"11570990","11577010"," If you are someone that's angry at the United States right now, the only thing I can say to you,"
"11577230","11580770"," I don't care where you are and any issues are politics and stuff like that."
"11582110","11587550"," Try to use the Fourth of July to just be a better person so you can be a better American."
"11587550","11590030"," However, you can rather than always pointing fingers and bitches. "
"11590350","11592610"," I see a lot of that on both sides of politics."
"11593150","11598630"," A lot of, you know, fuck this guy, fuck that guy or whatever."
"11599890","11602470"," Just be a better human, be a better American. "
"11604050","11605470"," Be an example for other people."
"11606990","11608270"," Be kind to your neighbors."
"11608530","11609970"," Be kind to your fellow Americans. "
"11611590","11613970"," Try to see where people are at in their lives."
"11614310","11615810"," Try to empathize with people."
"11615890","11618190"," I think it goes a long way in this country. "
"11623040","11624680"," Try to be an example for other people."
"11624900","11626080"," Try to, you know, live a good life."
"11627060","11627560"," That's important. "
"11628780","11630040"," We often miss that."
"11630240","11637060"," Sometimes we get good on the social media rabbit hole and we think, you know, we read things that"
"11637060","11639560"," are inflammatory no matter where you are in a subject or an issue."
"11640360","11642620"," Make sure you always vote for whatever you believe in. "
"11642720","11643920"," Make sure that you're a good citizen."
"11645540","11650380"," Be surprised if you feel your life up with that kind of stuff that helps you to be sane, right?"
"11650580","11651020"," Keep your sanity."
"11651740","11652580"," Keep yourself happy. "
"11653780","11656860"," Oftentimes, a lot of news that you see, a lot of things that you read, a lot of the things"
"11656860","11659380"," that happen can make you want to rage."
"11659780","11660460"," I can understand that."
"11660680","11662120"," I can understand that from both perspectives. "
"11663040","11664440"," But, you know, it's a good time."
"11664600","11666160"," For those lives, sometimes it's like a big party, right?"
"11667740","11670660"," Oftentimes, you forget why we declared our dependence."
"11671540","11678180"," We forget what makes us special and as who we should be, right, as people. "
"11679520","11681420"," We want we strive towards as Americans."
"11682200","11682920"," It's very important."
"11684420","11686560"," Think about that as the fourth rolls around. "
"11687240","11691920"," Rather than pointing fingers and saying, yeah, that guy sucks or that guy sucks or I don't like"
"11691920","11693360"," that guy or whatever these people think."
"11694020","11697820"," Like focusing that energy on the inside and saying, how do I become a better person?"
"11698660","11699740"," How do I become a better example?"
"11700160","11700780"," How do I give myself?"
"11703060","11705380"," It goes a long way in life, believe it or not."
"11706700","11708600"," A long, long, long, long way. "
"11711800","11717020"," Okay, so we're finding a little bit of finding some decent support here at the moment."
"11719180","11722120"," This is more bullish than bearish at the moment, just as a heads up."
"11723420","11729320"," You can see that we reclaimed this support once again. "
"11730040","11732320"," I still think, though, it could be wrong on this."
"11732320","11735300"," If you look above here, you can see that the supply has disappeared."
"11735960","11738540"," A lot of that supply has been used down below. "
"11738800","11740260"," That's bullish overall."
"11741820","11745600"," But I would think that we're still going to grind."
"11745780","11746840"," It's 1.25 in the afternoon. "
"11749260","11750200"," Can we go higher?"
"11750480","11750580"," Sure."
"11750920","11754620"," We've got lots of calls coming in or some calls coming in right now."
"11754960","11756280"," Still light trading right now. "
"11756980","11761740"," This is often a time of the day where you can get trapped or you can trade this."
"11762420","11764400"," But I wouldn't expect big moves."
"11765660","11768520"," So my point to you is that this would be like a trading zone. "
"11768780","11772980"," So if you were going to have, I shouldn't get rid of this right here for right now."
"11773120","11775420"," So I'm going to dump that right to the moment."
"11775580","11775760"," Okay. "
"11776360","11777680"," I'm going to show you guys some."
"11780320","11783440"," So just remember or think to yourself."
"11783840","11785300"," We know that this is where you buy, right?"
"11785300","11789940"," But think about this top area up here is kind of a localized top. "
"11791440","11793120"," Into the end of the day."
"11794000","11795700"," Not necessarily going to happen."
"11796060","11799400"," But on trend days on on any day like today. "
"11801780","11803440"," This is how I would do it."
"11803680","11805460"," You don't have to do it like this is how I would do it."
"11806860","11811380"," And I would just put a nice little nice little bull flag in here. "
"11811620","11811720"," Right."
"11811860","11812680"," We would reclaim this."
"11812680","11813980"," This is bullish by the way. "
"11814360","11817160"," But at the same time, I'm going to look for some consolidation still in here."
"11817780","11819680"," I'm going to extend this into the rest of the day."
"11820960","11823080"," And I'm going to look for, you know, where does this take?"
"11823260","11823900"," Where does this lead us?"
"11824020","11825540"," We break out of this later on or not. "
"11826840","11828000"," And I'm going to expect."
"11828340","11832360"," I'm expecting some kind of consolidation here for next leg up."
"11832780","11834140"," Even though even though this is bullish. "
"11836100","11839000"," So that's what I'm going to be looking for in the end of day."
"11840300","11845420"," Now, even while I'm looking at this, the VIX is consolidating as well, where we can have some"
"11845420","11846880"," continued failure down."
"11847660","11850600"," So we're not out of the woods if you're a bull trying to catch this. "
"11850940","11852120"," You can trade stuff like this."
"11852500","11854500"," I just would say to you if you trade stuff like this."
"11855280","11858760"," That you aren't expecting if you will follow my cursor here. "
"11859080","11861840"," You're not expecting to move from here straight to here right now."
"11862180","11862860"," It might happen."
"11863440","11868420"," But the logic says that you're going to be trading within a defined area. "
"11868880","11870420"," Until we get closer to the end of the day."
"11870580","11873960"," You might even see some down moves even below this 375."
"11875020","11878380"," But ultimately, we should see it move higher into this close today. "
"11878900","11880240"," The price target above is going to be 383."
"11882460","11883760"," We can make that move right now."
"11883800","11884540"," We can make that move later. "
"11884740","11885100"," I don't know."
"11886380","11889780"," But if you take this trade out, let's say you took this trade."
"11890460","11893020"," I'd be looking for some kind of a roll at some point up in here. "
"11893260","11895180"," You can see right here, this is 380, 96."
"11896260","11897840"," And that's right up here."
"11898160","11898260"," Right. "
"11898860","11900880"," So can we make this trade from here to here?"
"11901000","11901620"," Yes, we can."
"11902360","11908280"," But my experience that says that we're going to consolidate a little bit more in here."
"11908900","11911000"," We could even wish they had like a little. "
"11911560","11912260"," One second."
"11912780","11915160"," See if they could do a little, a negative one there."
"11918340","11923860"," Just from experience that I would think that we're going to, even if we were to trade, even if we"
"11923860","11928200"," were to trade up here, we would still get some, we would then get more consolidation here, stuff"
"11928200","11928680"," like this. "
"11932920","11937340"," If we didn't trade here, it wouldn't shock me to see something like even this."
"11938660","11940580"," Wouldn't shock me like that kind of stuff, right?"
"11940940","11942100"," Because we're just doing this kind of stuff."
"11942360","11944780"," Any of this kind of stuff makes sense to me still. "
"11945720","11949140"," So just be conscious of what you're doing in here."
"11949920","11950900"," It'll be something like this."
"11951920","11952580"," Hey, buddy. "
"11952680","11954340"," I want to you too, handsome boy."
"11955220","11956340"," Could be something like this."
"11956520","11957220"," We head up that way. "
"11957440","11963540"," Speak the conscience of this area right here is going to take some time."
"11963880","11967200"," Another thing to consider when you're in here is to follow my cursor."
"11967820","11969440"," There are some trapped buyers up in here. "
"11969700","11971620"," I don't know who's trapped up here, but there's some trap buyers."
"11972200","11973180"," Trap buyers here."
"11973760","11974640"," Trap buyers here. "
"11975020","11979280"," So if you look at my cursor here, I'll try to put something in there."
"11982400","11988690"," So this line right here, right?"
"11989330","11991190"," They're going to try to pin you here, right?"
"11991930","11995750"," So that these buyers are all trapped and they're like, oh, please Lord, just let it go up higher."
"11996650","11998750"," And I swear I'll just saw it on my calls. "
"11999250","12004650"," So you might see a rollover in here due to people getting out of their calls, right?"
"12005430","12010970"," You might not see us even trade there because we know there's pain there, right?"
"12010970","12016050"," So when I would trade above this zone, might keep rolling it over, call my cursor, might keep"
"12016050","12016630"," rolling it over."
"12017290","12021330"," We could blast off, but just as you start to think about this stuff, you're like, okay, we get"
"12021330","12022850"," trapped buyers, we need to get some more support."
"12024190","12025190"," Need to get some more buyers. "
"12025950","12030690"," If we break through here, you probably have buyers that are like, if we just make it to right here,"
"12030690","12032750"," I promise I'll sell my calls."
"12033430","12035710"," So think about that trader psychology."
"12036830","12045710"," Think about buyer psychology and how it interplays with the market on an intraday level, right?"
"12046550","12048490"," So they want to see us if we can break above this or not. "
"12049310","12052450"," I think we can, but I think we can push up higher here."
"12053490","12057790"," But just be conscious of that and the normal circumstances, even if you're not in calls, if you're"
"12057790","12063070"," not trapped right now, think about people that are trapped above here because you might buy in"
"12063070","12066210"," calls, not realize that there are trapped buyers back here."
"12069810","12074960"," I told you later that it's easy for us to trade within here. "
"12075720","12079660"," It's easy for us to go up at a price time of $3.81. This is very bullish though."
"12079820","12081200"," That rate of reclamation is very bullish."
"12082200","12082860"," Reclaiming that area. "
"12083040","12089880"," We've got a zone here at $3.80, $2.27. And that's right here, $3.80, $2.27 right here."
"12090640","12091620"," We have a little level right here."
"12091620","12095340"," This is this previous high right here, so pay attention to this one. "
"12096580","12099820"," We'll put one in right here."
"12101740","12104660"," $3.80, $2.27, I think it's that right there."
"12105780","12112900"," We'll make it dotted, make it small, right in there, right in there. "
"12116640","12118300"," That's right where the sellers start."
"12119500","12121240"," Sellers begin right here."
"12126130","12128690"," We'll write that in there so you can see it. "
"12132330","12133450"," We'll call them trap buyers."
"12143260","12144600"," We'll say they're stuck right there."
"12144700","12145800"," This is what trap buyers want to sell. "
"12149460","12153120"," It doesn't mean they don't trade higher than there, but I'm just saying that's where it's at."
"12154520","12155740"," That's where they're hiding right here."
"12166590","12169250"," I used to have cool names for my dog, dogs. "
"12170650","12171530"," Then I had kids."
"12173970","12179450"," And then we got, well, I had when I was young, I had cool names for dogs and they died."
"12180610","12182350"," Then we had dogs for the kids. "
"12183470","12186730"," And they don't name, I don't know why my kids name dogs like humans."
"12187990","12190870"," One dog's name is Henry, and the other name's dog is Jack."
"12191510","12192370"," I don't know why. "
"12194610","12195970"," I don't know where they figured out."
"12196190","12197830"," I don't know where they figured out those names."
"12198290","12201450"," I thought they were, I was like, of course, I could go ahead and read it. "
"12203130","12207450"," And I compile a list of 200 of the coolest names for dogs and cats."
"12209630","12211810"," And they named the dogs Jack and Henry."
"12212570","12214250"," And they named my cat Kitty. "
"12216370","12216930"," It's crazy."
"12217270","12218390"," We have one cat."
"12218530","12219210"," We had two cats. "
"12221550","12224310"," And we had one cat that ended up dying early."
"12224550","12229250"," So according to CNBC FTX, closes in on a deal to buy block by for $25 million."
"12232630","12235890"," And we had to take them to the hospital for their shots and all that kind of stuff. "
"12236070","12237210"," And they're like, what's the cat's names?"
"12238130","12238590"," We're like Kitty."
"12240410","12241170"," What's that cats?"
"12241350","12241810"," They were like Kitty."
"12242570","12243350"," It's just Kitty. "
"12245410","12246750"," Come here, kitties, Kitty."
"12247550","12248930"," That's all it is, is kitties."
"12250710","12253510"," Yeah, Sophie, Henry and Jack, yep. "
"12254470","12255210"," Give you human names."
"12255430","12255930"," Yeah, it's Sophie."
"12257370","12258070"," I love low. "
"12258250","12258850"," That's a great name."
"12263280","12266040"," This dream is sponsored by the tick."

"12281410","12281950"," Yep."
"12282410","12283390"," 25 million."
"12288030","12289590"," FTX is going to buy a block five. "
"12291790","12292870"," 25 million."
"12304680","12305700"," And they're in there."
"12305740","12310360"," See, FTC is ordering interactive brokers to pay one million dollars. "
"12310860","12311440"," No, it's million."
"12312140","12313380"," I think it was a million or a billion."
"12314420","12315340"," That was million. "
"12315860","12316480"," Did I say billion?"
"12317780","12320620"," Yeah, George and John gave me seriously."
"12321700","12326060"," George and John, it's like, it's like, I think it's 25 million."
"12332690","12333650"," I think it's a billion. "
"12334950","12336110"," Yeah, it's a fire sale."
"12336630","12338250"," 25 million in a fire sale."
"12338950","12339150"," Fuck. "
"12339470","12340670"," Can you believe how cheap that is?"
"12344310","12345010"," Insane it."
"12345510","12346210"," Insane, dude."
"12346790","12348570"," They had a one billion dollar loan. "
"12350090","12350790"," Block five."
"12352150","12354970"," I bet with, I bet I could put that money together with some friends."
"12356890","12357590"," In cash. "
"12358610","12359330"," Hard cash."
"12360790","12363190"," I bet I got enough friends who could put that together in a minute."
"12364210","12365350"," That's fucking insane. "
"12367270","12368490"," Can you believe that shit?"
"12368690","12370030"," Twenty five million dollars."
"12372710","12373330"," That's nothing."
"12379050","12379530"," Spy. "
"12379770","12380250"," Damn it."
"12387230","12392470"," You guys want to see the, you guys want to see the, the, I don't, I don't normally, well, not"
"12392470","12397710"," always, but the charts so small that I don't bother putting the moving averages up."
"12400880","12402020"," It's kind of funny too, right?"
"12404280","12405980"," Not putting the moving averages up. "
"12409360","12410640"," I think it's kind of funny."
"12414400","12415640"," I like the seven day."
"12421810","12423990"," Like 20, like 250, that's 200. "
"12425430","12426690"," 50, 200."
"12427970","12429450"," And these lines suck though."
"12429790","12430810"," I'm not going to do this right now. "
"12431210","12432850"," This is a white front, this computer."
"12433190","12435290"," So I'm going to put moving averages on right now."
"12436910","12439310"," Nice trade higher to the top of the channel. "
"12440650","12441790"," See if there's any resistance here."
"12441850","12442510"," I'm not seeing any."
"12447270","12449870"," I'm going to continue to trade higher to this three eighty one. "
"12453170","12454810"," Sellers now above three eighty one."
"12455330","12456310"," Trap buyers here."
"12456450","12458170"," Three eighty one is the price target right here. "
"12458190","12458690"," Watch my cursor."
"12459530","12462150"," See if we can get up there or if we're going to roll it over right now."
"12465930","12466790"," Is that what it is?"
"12466970","12468990"," Four point five billion to twenty five billion. "
"12469510","12472890"," You know, I got to tell you guys, I'm a fucking bull, but I got to tell you guys."
"12473630","12474650"," I'm warning you."
"12477130","12479550"," That housing crisis when that shit went down. "
"12479710","12481730"," They made movies about it and shit like that."
"12482070","12488930"," I'm fucking telling you somebody out there is getting some bank out there, right?"
"12489690","12491370"," Some hedge for not a hedge fund."
"12491910","12496670"," An investment bank out there is ultra fucked in the crypto space. "
"12497610","12498230"," Guaranteed."
"12499670","12500290"," Guaranteed."
"12502670","12503850"," I guarantee it. "
"12504190","12506970"," I'm not talking about the most like I posted this."
"12506970","12508670"," I was trying to dig through my tweets."
"12509550","12513490"," I couldn't find it, but like a couple of years ago, I posted about. "
"12515330","12517190"," You could take loans for crypto."
"12519230","12521130"," You take a fucking loan and buy crypto."
"12521630","12523690"," Like you know, those people getting all fucked up. "
"12524370","12525770"," Getting all wrecked and trashed."
"12526790","12532050"," But you know also that whoever's backing that shit behind the scenes."
"12532830","12534250"," Whenever that shit comes out, finally. "
"12535750","12537270"," That'll probably be the nail in the coffin."
"12537510","12540990"," If I had a nail, take one stab at it."
"12541070","12542370"," I don't think it's housing this time either. "
"12542730","12545050"," There's some real risk in the commercial housing market."
"12545870","12548210"," Not the residential housing market."
"12550350","12552270"," But the real craziness. "
"12552750","12553470"," It's going to be like."
"12554410","12556230"," It's going to be something that you didn't know."
"12557250","12559910"," So there was this article that was put out about a year or two ago. "
"12561860","12567000"," And the story really isn't like the loans, the crypto loans per se."
"12567300","12568360"," That really wasn't the story."
"12569380","12571860"," And even now no one's harping on it, which they should. "
"12572140","12574600"," I see some of these articles still about that whole story."
"12575040","12577500"," But not about the part of the story that's most important."
"12582810","12584590"," I don't see that talked about right now. "
"12585030","12592640"," And that is that that's that part of that space, the space, right?"
"12594600","12595380"," Like that."
"12596100","12601980"," I'm not going to say I was going to say, but that space, not so much like the crypto space."
"12603420","12608340"," Not so much even the loan space on its own on the user end. "
"12610340","12612440"," Oh, yeah, look at that squeeze, baby."
"12613000","12613460"," Squeeze it."
"12614720","12615360"," Squeeze it. "
"12617160","12617440"," That squeeze."
"12619040","12619780"," Pushing higher now."
"12619780","12621220"," Three, eighty one is the price target. "
"12623200","12624200"," Trap buyers here."
"12624520","12625540"," Three, eighty one is the price."
"12625740","12626520"," My cursor is. "
"12628140","12629160"," Three, eighty three calls."
"12629760","12630500"," Oh, yeah."
"12630720","12631440"," I want that so bad. "
"12632980","12634420"," I want that so bad."
"12636060","12636560"," So the."
"12636840","12639760"," So I'm in that in that space that I'm talking about. "
"12639880","12640880"," I forget what it's called right now."
"12641000","12642440"," I've tried to find it the other day."
"12644120","12644720"," This one. "
"12644860","12647540"," I came out a long time or a year or two."
"12647680","12650080"," I thought I'm not saying I thought I knew I posted it."
"12650360","12651660"," But when I searched for it, use the keywords. "
"12651920","12652940"," I couldn't find it in my timeline."
"12655100","12656980"," It was really like crypto was like peaking."
"12659200","12660400"," Still squeezing higher now. "
"12660600","12661100"," Three seventy nine."
"12661480","12662260"," Seventy five."
"12662980","12664560"," Trap buyers at three eighty twenty. "
"12665860","12667200"," It's not showing up here in book map."
"12667340","12668080"," We know they're there."
"12668860","12672160"," And then above that, the price target would be three eighty one oh seven. "
"12673200","12676020"," If we can rest here or just continue higher."
"12676360","12679660"," This is very bullish for the spy."
"12680440","12682720"," Came back from breaking a perfect tag down below. "
"12683260","12684060"," Now trading high."
"12684180","12686060"," This is the second trade that I've missed."
"12687100","12688560"," So I did not take this trade. "
"12688700","12689600"," I should have and I didn't."
"12689720","12690200"," This one over here."
"12690280","12694740"," I missed because I was fucking flapping my gums about how to make consistent money in the stock"
"12694740","12695180"," market. "
"12696660","12698060"," But we'll watch this one here."
"12698160","12700560"," This one should go to at least three eighty twenty two."
"12701080","12703040"," And I think it's three eighty twenty three. "
"12704200","12707760"," And then three eighty one oh seven is the price target above."
"12709560","12710580"," There's nobody here."
"12710880","12711680"," There's no sellers here. "
"12712300","12713420"," So be aware of that."
"12713740","12717300"," If you follow my cursor on the right hand side, I want you to watch my cursor over here as"
"12717300","12717920"," it comes over."
"12718360","12720220"," And we slide back over here. "
"12720900","12722300"," That's three eighty fifty nine."
"12722460","12723660"," Another point of interest."
"12724900","12726220"," Because there's no more sellers. "
"12726560","12727900"," No more buyers here either."
"12728580","12729400"," Together as a whole."
"12729720","12731900"," We see the sellers have been pushed above the three eighty three. "
"12731900","12733100"," We know about that number up here."
"12735060","12737060"," I might I might enter into this trade if I can."
"12737780","12738880"," Give me just a minute here. "
"12741100","12742420"," I might take a trade here."
"12744960","12748460"," But in that crypto space that I'm talking about, it's unregulated."
"12748980","12749260"," The key. "
"12749760","12750780"," I don't know what the name of it is."
"12750900","12752400"," But think about it like this."
"12752400","12758460"," If you're if you're originating loans from traditional mortgage, right?"
"12760460","12763500"," There are regulations that's a regulated industry. "
"12763760","12765200"," There's oversight in that industry."
"12765560","12768100"," So we're not talking even about just the user end."
"12768100","12772080"," But we're talking about the rules on the back end. "
"12773940","12775600"," How this stuff gets funded."
"12775840","12777320"," How the money is made."
"12777880","12778700"," Who's responsible. "
"12779720","12780260"," Practices."
"12781400","12781940"," Ethics."
"12781940","12782980"," All kinds of stuff. "
"12784200","12788830"," And that's where that's usually where in that article that I read, that's usually where."
"12789580","12791480"," The real fuckery comes around."
"12791800","12794960"," Like you think that there might be fuckery in like a in like a."
"12795480","12796300"," A meme. "
"12797460","12798980"," Crypto that goes to fun."
"12801000","12805600"," There's a bunch you can look at that representative of that of that happening."
"12806780","12808440"," Luna is a prime example. "
"12808700","12810300"," But the key in the story is."
"12812340","12815500"," It's not actually Luna where the real fuckery happens."
"12815900","12819600"," The real fuckery happens on the loan side on the back end of it. "
"12819980","12822080"," You don't know who's actually known."
"12823580","12828000"," In the background in an investment bank side of the finance industry."
"12828480","12829880"," That's funding this stuff. "
"12830660","12832400"," And running the Wild West operations."
"12834180","12837120"," When it like you can see the thinking is."
"12837820","12838940"," In terms of risk. "
"12840020","12843840"," The real risk is this is this is similar to the housing market."
"12845260","12847900"," There are prepat or packaging mortgages, right?"
"12848540","12850920"," Shitty mortgages on top of shitty mortgages on top of shitty mortgages. "
