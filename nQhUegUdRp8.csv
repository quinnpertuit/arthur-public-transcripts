"66960","68240"," That was a nightly switchover."
"68420","68920"," That was horrible."
"70780","71900"," Good morning, Arushi. "
"73500","73900"," BTCCKK."
"74980","75720"," Hot's good morning."
"75940","76360"," How are y'all doing?"
"78940","79940"," Let's go, Cap. "
"80140","80560"," How was the weather?"
"81320","81740"," Last night?"
"82040","82400"," Oh, it was terrible."
"84300","84740"," Wind's blowing."
"85900","86540"," Trees coming down. "
"86840","87860"," I didn't lose any power, thankfully."
"89440","98420"," And, you know, what's crazy is, I have a refrigerator that once we, our house was struck by"
"98420","98960"," lightning once."
"99980","101800"," And I've got grounding rods and everything. "
"101940","103120"," I've got breakers."
"103280","105040"," I've got special breakers in my box."
"105520","105980"," It didn't matter. "
"106540","107280"," I blew up my refrigerator."
"107560","108580"," It cost me a couple thousand bucks."
"109160","111160"," So, I didn't plug my refrigerator last night. "
"115180","116380"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"117900","118560"," Yes, sir."
"118720","119100"," Start early."
"119300","120240"," We got a lot to go over this morning. "
"121540","122700"," Good morning, one day at a time."
"122920","123180"," Morning Mac."
"123360","124320"," Morning King Hotel. "
"124700","125340"," Good morning, 8K."
"125440","125960"," Good morning, Jesus."
"126320","127520"," Anybody that's showing up this morning. "
"129500","132080"," You did the right thing because we have some stuff to go over."
"132240","138580"," You know, I have an interesting cool thing to show you this morning because I'm kind of known for"
"138580","138780"," this."
"140160","144320"," And I've been struggling with putting this together. "
"144320","149160"," Not struggling, but I want to be able to, we've got two different kind of markets heading our way."
"150240","151460"," And we're going to talk about it."
"152140","153780"," Is it raining hard and indie last night too?"
"153920","153980"," Yeah. "
"154340","159440"," Do we got like, it's weird too because I'm working on my backyard right now trying to regrade it."
"159740","163020"," And it's times like this where I look watching closely."
"163580","165160"," And I just waterproofed my basement. "
"165400","165700"," It's working."
"166100","166400"," So, I'm stoked."
"167560","168400"," Good morning, everybody. "
"169180","169200"," Yes."
"169480","170560"," You know, tornado is a weird."
"172620","175640"," Thanks for buying the day, right, baby?"
"178320","182380"," Can I more cap thanks for the VOD and the day report today?"
"182600","186760"," Can you touch on how the correlation is resettling and is going to play into April. "
"186760","187860"," Thanks for a solid."
"188060","190260"," Hey, thank you too, Vicki."
"191620","192660"," Better rain than snow. "
"194580","195340"," Yeah, it's weird."
"195700","197020"," I don't, I'm not from Michigan."
"197660","200760"," So I, you know, I want, I want tons of snow when I lived out west. "
"201320","202840"," But at Michigan, I can do without it here."
"203600","205400"," So we're going to switch over to something else real quick."
"206340","207640"," I think I got this right here. "
"217430","220610"," So I'm going to bring this over one step at a time here for you this morning."
"220710","220870"," Okay."
"221090","225110"," So this morning, no one really cares about the economic calendar. "
"225690","226430"," It looks like this morning."
"226590","228990"," I could be wrong in this, but it looks like nobody gives a fine fuck."
"229690","233150"," Now, this is the, um, the U.S. Turbo Goods order. "
"233150","236710"," You can see if our bulletin, U.S. Turbo Goods orders dropped more than forecast in February."
"237190","239110"," And also claims of the lowest they've ever been."
"239430","240470"," We already know why, right?"
"240590","242990"," We already know that everyone's been on employment for a couple of years. "
"243470","245310"," We know that people, there's two things going on."
"245630","249590"," Number one, people need to get back to work or want to get back to work or they hate their"
"249590","252950"," fucking wives or husbands, their boyfriends and girlfriends or whatever, right?"
"253570","254750"," Uh, well, they've been stuck in the house."
"255209","258649"," It could just be money and also, uh, people aren't eligible. "
"258649","261690"," This is the second part is that people aren't eligible for unemployment anymore."
"262230","269310"," And a lot of these initial claims, uh, rely upon not only, uh, uh, people, uh, being unemployed,"
"269310","271090"," but they're claiming unemployment, right?"
"271250","274670"," So it's probably a stack of people out there that aren't working right now that aren't claiming"
"274670","275450"," anything."
"275530","278130"," So of course you're going to expect these numbers to come in. "
"278270","281170"," None of this is not, uh, not expected, right?"
"282250","284150"," We've got, uh, continuing claims as well."
"284150","290830"," Good orders, core capital goods, current account deficit as well at eight thirty."
"290970","294130"," And then we've got lots of fed, uh, little Fed presidents talking, right?"
"294250","296390"," We've got a nail cash carry at eight thirty. "
"296570","298290"," We've got Waller at nine ten."
"298710","303450"," And then we've got the S&P market manufacturing PMI flash at nine forty five."
"303650","307550"," And then we've got the, uh, the PMI flash, excuse me, the global, I think that I don't know why"
"307550","308410"," that's in there twice, but. "
"309830","311150"," Oh, no, sorry, I missed that one."
"311490","313370"," The Atlanta Fed on my microphone is covering everything."
"313730","317570"," Atlanta Fed President Ralph Bostick speaks again at eleven a.m. this morning. "
"317610","321450"," So we've got a full docket of volatility on par for today."
"321910","324990"," So just looking at the day, you already know that we're probably going to have some kind of"
"324990","329890"," volatility between now and eleven a.m. And it kind of stacks up to where we are, where the charts"
"329890","330690"," are right now."
"331210","333030"," And, uh, we'll talk about, we're going to talk about a few things. "
"333210","334630"," We're going to get through a lot of stuff this morning."
"334950","338010"," We're also going to look at some indicators for you."
"338010","341350"," If you're a bull or a bear, I've got the indicators for you. "
"341710","343210"," I hope that you've signed up this morning."
"343390","349810"," If you are already, or if you haven't already for, um, trading view, a couple other notes."
"349810","354710"," If you're not a part of the discord, we, we stream live time. "
"355630","357870"," As well as my voice, I think, is streaming in there."
"358170","363730"," Uh, we, we stream options flow, uh, directed options flow, some of the best options flow flow."
"363910","367390"," You can get out there and discord in one of the voice channels. "
"367390","372510"," So if you were to bring up two screeners for yourself to order to to to, um, I don't know,"
"372530","377650"," displays on one monitor or something, you can, uh, watch this broadcast on YouTube."
"377850","385210"," You either mute YouTube or mute, uh, discord and follow along with both book map, uh, candlestick"
"385210","389910"," charts, the options flow and then also be listening in, uh, to the news."
"390350","395370"," You guys know that the news that we have that we run here is faster than anywhere else on the"
"395370","396090"," internet period. "
"396270","401550"," Nowhere else you're getting, uh, faster impact than the news that's impactful when it's meaningful"
"401550","402410"," to the market."
"402810","404250"," Uh, so stay tuned every day with us."
"404790","408670"," Uh, we're going to go over some cool, some cool indicators for you to be looking at. "
"408930","414310"," Now tomorrow we're going to, I think tomorrow we're going to focus on macro under the hood, but as"
"414310","420710"," you as an equity trader, as a futures trader, as an equity trader, uh, we're going to, we're going"
"420710","425750"," to look at some indicators that you can be checking on day in, day out before you start your day,"
"425870","429590"," when you end your day, uh, to know when to be buying and when to be selling."
"429590","430030"," Okay."
"430510","434630"," And we're going to talk about that because I'm kind of known for the last couple of years saying,"
"434630","437330"," hey, that we're going to buy this bottom, we're going to buy this bottom, we're going to buy this"
"437330","437530"," bottom. "
"437710","443250"," If you only bought these bottoms, you would be rich and you would have made zero bad trades in two"
"443250","447930"," straight years, right, just zero, not a single bad trade in two straight years."
"447930","453250"," So we're going to look at an indicator this morning that actually, uh, it still does the same"
"453250","453610"," thing."
"454030","459210"," Even right now, matter of fact, it's worked right through January sell, believe it or not, January"
"459210","463450"," sell off February, March, uh, that this is the, this is the indicator. "
"463790","463950"," Okay."
"464150","468350"," Now there's some, uh, some other indicators are going to add to it just so that you can get a"
"468350","473970"," firmer understanding beneath the surface as to, uh, what, what, what this means if it continue, if"
"473970","477450"," we continue higher, or if there's problems in the mechanics underneath."
"477770","481150"," So we're going to go over that this morning, uh, we're going to get to that at some point this"
"481150","481410"," morning. "
"481410","485730"," Uh, so we've got some, we've got some volatility on the docket until 11 a.m. Right."
"486650","490990"," Tomorrow we don't have much in the news until 10 a.m. We don't have a lot going on, but"
"490990","494830"," we do have a stack of speakers again heading into Friday."
"495390","499770"," And this has been concerning me of the past week and a half because you're not, I mean, they're"
"499770","501450"," lining up with a no news week. "
"501490","506590"," They're just stacking them high so that, so that these fed speakers are talking to you."
"507050","512909"," You know that, uh, Fed Chair Powell was very hawkish in his last speech and then all of this, all"
"512909","518270"," of this accumulated, I guess, is my question into an end of the week thing I posted on Twitter"
"518270","521690"," saying, do we get a surprise rate hike increase?"
"522070","526150"," If you read some of those newsletters I put out yesterday's newsletter actually discusses,"
"527450","534650"," discusses in, in, in says short blurb, it says that that there's a discussion about a regime going"
"534650","535690"," back to 1994."
"536630","541750"," And I don't know if you know this or not, but the last time we had an emergency rate hike"
"542190","546630"," was night, I believe 1994, can be wrong in this, but I think it was 1994, if I recall. "
"547730","551970"," So there is the underneath the current of the, of the, of the retail market."
"552290","554430"," There is most certainly a discussion about that."
"554690","561850"," Furthermore about yesterday, we talked about yesterday on Twitter, we talked about existential of"
"561850","568010"," the equities market, what's going on in gold, what's going on in the bond market, what's going on"
"568010","571770"," TLT yesterday, what's going on with the dollar. "
"572250","576750"," So there are some, some exit as an exogenous, right, things that are going on outside of the market"
"576750","579170"," that are telling a different story than where we are."
"579410","586530"," So we're going to start today on just, uh, just some oscillators, some indicators and and why you"
"586530","590410"," should be bullish or why you shouldn't be bullish, where you should be buying dips, where you"
"590410","595410"," should be selling tops, and then tomorrow we're going to focus on that other stuff so that you can"
"595410","601070"," have two new toolkits said to your, to your bag, your toolbox every single day."
"601150","602410"," And the first one today is going to be simple. "
"603650","609590"," Now moving on from that, the spot gamma report for this morning, okay, the SG report this morning."
"609930","610750"," Let's go through that together."
"611010","611090"," Okay. "
"611310","616930"," Futures are up slightly to 447 after a quiet overnight session, our volatility estimates 0.86 from"
"616930","621970"," open and key trading levels remain in line with yesterday, resistance is at 454510."
"622150","623850"," That's the same as yesterday, right?"
"624510","625390"," Nothing has changed."
"625750","628290"," Support lies at 4473 and then 4450. "
"628870","634870"," Last week we laid out the following map and movement thus far as according to plan key in on that."
"635010","635230"," Okay."
"635590","636590"," Key in on that. "
"636850","642610"," Last week I harped and harped and harped on this with you saying if we don't get expansion, we will"
"642610","645690"," roll this market over and it could go deep, okay?"
"647050","652550"," It's over 4500 where, where, where in dealer resistance begins to increase, which means the market"
"652550","655230"," needs a catalyst to push, push higher, higher, okay?"
"655870","661970"," With gamma near zero and then it drained off the market seems to have run out of steam key in"
"661970","662290"," on that."
"662290","662570"," Okay."
"662930","668070"," We ran out of steam yesterday and this morning we did catch up ounce this morning. "
"668750","673610"," Matter of fact, I did buy that close yesterday with some call spreads for end of month because"
"674110","677010"," there is, that we talked about the JPM caller yesterday, right?"
"677190","684270"," On Twitter we talked about it and then we, we also talked yesterday about it being end of quarter"
"684270","690650"," and if we have a red quarter, the impact of that for the following quarter and then just the"
"690650","696390"," recovery, if we have, if we have a red quarter right and opens a door up to much deeper selling,"
"696750","700270"," it opens the door up also to a recovery that takes much longer."
"700570","705710"," You start to stack these quarters up and then you, you're talking about a recovery that can expand"
"705710","711610"," into one, two, three years and then you've heard me in the past talk about, you have to, this is,"
"711690","716390"," this is, this is going to lace right into the indicators I'm going to show you this morning and"
"716390","723370"," that is that the last two years you could buy anywhere and you were up as an investor and I've"
"723370","731830"," made note in broadcasting on Twitter that you have to now actively manage your investments, you"
"731830","738790"," have to actively manage your trades and we're not, we're not buying to over time now, right?"
"739330","745690"," We've switched the regime from, hey we're buying, we're buying, I'm buying and holding and I'm just"
"745690","750650"," going to dollar cost average in an ad whether it's on a high or a low for two straight years."
"750950","755610"," You've had that easy street and now we're back to, oh we have to buy bottoms and sell tops here"
"755610","761050"," and manage throughout, I would expect from now for the next one to three years minimum. "
"761590","768250"," If you do not, there is a fair chance that you are looking at a decade where because of inflation,"
"768710","779910"," because of the rate increases, taxes, wage tagflation, any number of things, just"
"779910","785110"," you could see that money get invested somewhere else like let's say gold and you're just not going"
"785110","791150"," to have the money backing your investment so that even if you buy a bottom, right, or just this one"
"791150","796030"," bottom and ride trend up, or even if it's slowly, let's say the market goes up 3% every year"
"796030","800870"," for the next three years, you're still not going to beat inflation, you're still not going to beat"
"800870","805490"," anything else out there, or you're not going to beat the investment that you made in equities"
"805490","810550"," whereas some other investment that all the money fled to is going up by hundreds of percent over"
"810550","816570"," years, like equities used to do, so the key is this, if you want to stay in the equity market,"
"816930","821490"," we're going to talk tomorrow about other investments for you, but for today we want to talk to you"
"821490","826230"," about equities, if you are going to stay in equities and you have to actively manage your"
"826230","830910"," investments, you have to say it's not time, now it's going to be price based, right, I'm going to"
"830910","836810"," buy bottoms, we're going to have a lot of bottoms, no, we are not, this is the last time I'm"
"836810","841610"," going to say it, we are not going up like the last two years for the next two years, it"
"841610","847490"," is not happening, even if the money faucets still on slightly, it ain't on like it used to be on,"
"847730","853730"," so that until that happens again, you have the ability to lose your investments, even if you're"
"853730","857910"," just saying, hey, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing for the last two years, you will wind"
"857910","864290"," up, you will wind up in 10 years, being not only flat, if not flat, you will be under your"
"864290","870150"," initial investments, to be worse often if you had bought just a savings account with 0.06%"
"870150","877330"," interest, believe it or not, jockingly, so that's my take on the market, okay, now last week we"
"877330","880550"," laid out this falling map, according to a plan of 4500, where as daily resistance is beginning to"
"880550","883890"," increase, which means that the market needs to count as push higher, with given there is zero and"
"883890","888330"," then a drained off the market, it seems to have run out of steam, right, we saw that regime, watch"
"888330","894170"," my cursor right here, right, we saw that happen here, right, we pushed down, tried to come back up,"
"894370","900670"," had no catalyst rise higher, and we wound up selling down deeper, okay, this is a pretty big move"
"900670","907890"," right here, this is about a 10% move down from highs, and we're look like we're coming right back"
"907890","913470"," into that again right now, so just be conscience of this, be conscience of these fed speakers"
"913470","919590"," coming out, be conscience that they're just stacking up, okay, there was also a lot of news this"
"919590","923610"," morning, you saw everybody wants to talk about nuclear war, right, it's almost like they're priming"
"923610","929370"," the pipes right now for some kind of a bad catalyst, there's a lot of talk around 4510 JPM put"
"929370","934310"," strike, and its implications for current prices are view on this is quite simple, by default the 44 "
"934310","940750",",000 contracts here are decaying, and that will buoy in the market into March 31st, right, we talked"
"940750","946370"," about this yesterday on Twitter, right, therefore the idea of playing mean revision back into 4500"
"946370","952230"," make some sense here, however if sellers emerge possibly through some exo jettison, jettison"
"952230","958390"," geopolitical catalyst, then those high gamma puts will add a lot of firepower to a move lower, this"
"958390","963630"," is jump risk, along this general idea we've added the VIX one day implied move to our dashboard"
"963630","969550"," below, you notice that the VIX one day did one day implied move at 1.48% is quite a"
"969550","975850"," bit higher than our gamma base forecast of 0.89%. The basic idea here is that the VIX SG spread"
"975850","980470"," implies options may be rich, which is not terribly surprising due to the event ball premium"
"980470","985810"," geopolitical politics, higher rates, etc, selling very, very short dated options, i.e. Friday"
"985810","991150"," likely appeals to a fair number of traders, and we think that can help add some support on"
"991150","991970"," drawdowns."
"992730","997690"," The key here being that maybe we can get a little dip into Friday, but we're not going to go"
"997690","999910"," quite as deep as that 4000, right?"
"1001050","1006830"," And you know, it's quite as deep as that 4000, start selling you all these puts that are down"
"1006830","1011670"," there, start selling you those 400s so that you're buying them up and out of the hands of some big"
"1011670","1015670"," cowboy or somebody that's got loads of them down there, maybe a Carl Eichen, right?"
"1015930","1019630"," See Carl Eichen's out there the past couple days, doom and gloom, right?"
"1020110","1024770"," I'm preparing, I'm preparing, he's probably holding all those 4000 puts down, then he wants you,"
"1025190","1027369"," the sucker, the retail trader to buy him."
"1028589","1031750"," So we're going to scroll through the rest of this this morning, I'll go through this slow, you can"
"1031750","1038010"," always, you can always pause this broadcast, come back through and get your levels here for, or for"
"1038010","1044530"," the spy, and for the cues and SPX, you can see some basic key support and resistances, mostly we"
"1044530","1049870"," know about those, and then we're going to go through some gamma levels and some voltriggers in and"
"1049870","1051630"," in and of itself here, okay?"
"1052110","1055130"," See a voltrigger down here, a 4400, right?"
"1056810","1065290"," Keep on scrolling down, voltrigger 445 right here for the spy, keep on going on down, keep on"
"1065290","1069170"," scrolling on down, you can always mute this, come back and take a look at these numbers down here,"
"1069510","1076710"," and that's all I got for you for, for the, for Spock gamma today. "
"1077050","1078010"," So what does that mean?"
"1078930","1080850"," We're gonna add that to a whole bunch of other crap, right?"
"1082270","1088230"," We're gonna look at a one year chart here for the spy, we know that we're going to be fighting"
"1088230","1091550"," for this 200-day moving average, we see it right here, right?"
"1092670","1098430"," We see the move down below it back here on February 14th, we fought to get above, failed, right?"
"1098810","1103110"," Failed to hold this and we, we don't want to come back down, and then what, that's that key, that"
"1103110","1108030"," same key is implied here, if we trade below this 200 moving day average here, right?"
"1108470","1110510"," I've got this big dotted line down here, right?"
"1110950","1113890"," I don't want to see us start dipping below here, right?"
"1114070","1118410"," Because you'll see a rejection again, you can see it right back here how it took place, right?"
"1118810","1124470"," Trade it above it, but we came back down here, bounced, rejected and started to sell down lower,"
"1124830","1129790"," and I've got these, the same setup here, ready for today, tomorrow and into Friday, right?"
"1130110","1132310"," Do we make that trip below down here?"
"1133330","1135610"," Do we break this support down here at 435?"
"1136190","1140510"," Because if we do break 435, I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen, you're gonna see us trade"
"1140510","1145970"," down no lower than 410, and you're gonna see us also open the door, depending on where you are,"
"1146070","1151110"," like 405, this is where all those puts are down here, 405, and that's what they want to do."
"1151450","1158710"," Now, though they want to do that, there can be some large players out there, GS, JPM, and they're"
"1158710","1165250"," like, hey, we don't want to get in below, below, or we don't want a bad quarter here, and you"
"1165250","1171230"," also see that these big banks threw all their clients money into this market to buy it down here,"
"1171610","1173790"," they bought this market way down here, right?"
"1174110","1179410"," So they can go back to their clients and say, don't worry, Jim Bob, we know the market's sold off,"
"1179510","1184850"," but I shorted the market, and then I bought the bottom for you, and now it's rising back up, so"
"1184850","1189130"," you got a major money on the short, shorting your own your own your own shit stocks, and then I"
"1189130","1193690"," bought more for you at the end of the quarter, we saved the quarter, I know you had a bad"
"1193690","1199030"," three month, bad two months, but your third month, we did you right, so that's my thought, right?"
"1199370","1205390"," And that's probably the thought of most bulls at least, until at least the 31st or the 1st is"
"1205390","1207230"," they're going to attempt to save the quarter."
"1208190","1214290"," Okay, so this 200 this 200 a moving average is going to be important for you as a bull and"
"1214290","1218050"," as a bear, right, and they get a bears like we're gonna get rid of this market, they're gonna sell"
"1218050","1222790"," this down, get us a red quarter, and I'll tell you what, if we do sell down before the 1st,"
"1223130","1226670"," you can probably give it the 1st too, but I'll tell you what, if we get a bad quarter, right,"
"1227430","1233210"," it's ugly, it's real ugly, you're talking about, when we talked about this in January, right,"
"1233530","1237950"," you're gonna take the bear the bull suit off and you're gonna put that bear suit on, there is no"
"1237950","1244290"," saving it once you have the bad quarter, or at least historically, there is no saving it, okay, it"
"1244290","1250810"," does signal some real negativity down the road for us if we break through, I think it's 453 or 4,"
"1250990","1257330"," I think someone was saying it was 453, I think it's 435, I think technically it might be 453, but"
"1257330","1263170"," in reality, it's, I was looking at January and then February and now March, the real ugly is 435,"
"1263670","1270090"," you break through 435, you close before below 435 heading into the 1st, it's gonna be bad, it's"
"1270090","1275770"," gonna be real bad, that's three bad months, I think they're 435 and some changes the actual number,"
"1276150","1280550"," it might be like a technical number that's higher, but in all reality, you don't want to see below"
"1280550","1288330"," 435, that's three red months in a row, double upon a bad quarter, so pay attention to this 435"
"1288330","1294150"," number down here, it's very important for you, for today, for today, the key support and resistance"
"1294150","1302150"," for today is going to be, this is your support down here, 4450, don't want to break this, this is"
"1302150","1308650"," other key support, this is S2 for you, and we're below it currently, 44729, and here you have your"
"1308650","1315050"," resistance above 4,500 and 4,510, which we've talked, or which Scott Gama talked about, and their"
"1315050","1321850"," point here, their point here is that, this is their point here that try to tell you is, that you,"
"1321910","1327790"," you should be looking for more call expansion today, right, we talk about this all the time, more"
"1327790","1335610"," call expansion so that we can break above, break out of this resistance at 451 and start to trade"
"1335610","1344530"," to 460, or near 460, 450 to 460, right, if we can't get this call expansion here, you know what"
"1344530","1349390"," we talk about on this channel all the time, we talk about, if you don't see it up here, you"
"1349390","1354070"," get told no, right, you come up here to see it, and if you get told no, right, that's two"
"1354070","1359930"," tries for the bulls, you usually only get two tries, at most you might get a third try, I mean"
"1359930","1365270"," that's gonna start heading lower, okay, so you might get one more try today, I don't see you not"
"1365270","1370410"," getting another try at it today, I think you should get it today, but I'll tell you what, one, two"
"1370410","1376930"," tries, we talk about how days pass, when you start to trade sideways, and you don't make new highs,"
"1377270","1383230"," right, we will start to consolidate, and we will start to sell down until we do find some support"
"1383230","1390190"," that'll take us higher, that's important to know, okay, that one, two, and three, bye bye, or one,"
"1390290","1395910"," two, and then we go up, or one, and then two, we go up, but if you don't see this"
"1395910","1402050"," support, so your keys for today, are you're gonna be watching the VIX, are you gonna be watching"
"1402050","1407930"," the options flow today, now you could be watching as well the the hero indicator, but if you see"
"1407930","1413050"," real money selling coming in, the hero indicator could be going wild with calls, and matter of"
"1413050","1417170"," fact, we'll talk about Tesla later what that happens, oftentimes indicators don't work on Tesla"
"1417170","1423190"," because it is, it's a it's a cult stock, right, so because it's the cult stock that you can't"
"1423190","1430850"," always trust indicators, you'll buyers on Tesla, no matter what, whereas typically in spy, ES, SPX,"
"1430850","1436310"," you can actually see indicators actually tell a better story as to what's going on, now so just be"
"1436310","1440910"," aware of this today, if you don't see this call expansion today, if we don't see any real money"
"1440910","1445470"," selling, we'll pay attention to that on book, book map today, if real money sellers come in, you're"
"1445470","1451010"," gonna expect us to trade lower until we find support, and we've talked about where that support"
"1451010","1456810"," lies in the past, let me get rid of this here, close this out, and that support is down here,"
"1457110","1463370"," you know 440, it could be slightly higher, you could bring us like 440, 68, right, we're looking"
"1463370","1468350"," down here for the, we'll see this little nice little bounce down here, this 437, I think it's 438"
"1468350","1472230"," is where I saw one yesterday, we'll look at book map again today and make sure these levels are"
"1472230","1476550"," correct, we'll adjust them as need be, we'll scroll down and take a peek, and then down here at"
"1476550","1482350"," 435, you don't want to break this 435, if you break this 435, we're making a trip lower, we could"
"1482350","1487470"," break through for a minute and come back up, there's a great dip buy down here at 438 to 435,"
"1488150","1492890"," great area to dip by, we'll track this closely if we do begin to sell off, but be aware of"
"1492890","1497710"," this today, and be aware of call expansion, if we get this call expansion, you're looking for calls"
"1497710","1505210"," that are like 460 to 470, in all reality, you want to see 465s, you want to see 470s, not"
"1505210","1511350"," just those call hedges, you want to see calls to expand upon the call hedging that came out this"
"1511350","1515250"," past three to four days, now we're going to talk about something here, that is important, okay,"
"1515650","1518890"," we're going to get rid of all this real quick, we're going to get rid of this economic calendar"
"1518890","1522510"," here, we're going to bring this back over here, and we're going to talk about something very"
"1522510","1527390"," important here, and this is the trading view chart that I want to talk to you about this morning,"

"1611640","1618740"," actually tells you, gives you an explanation as to what it means, right, how it works, the market"
"1618740","1622380"," breath studies attempt to undercover strength and weakness and movements of an index, they're not"
"1622380","1627040"," visible simply by looking at a chart of the index down here, right, you can go through this on your"

"1696880","1704680"," time to get down to a bottom down here, right, it wasn't an event that took a week, right, and"
"1704680","1708800"," the same thing happened over here as well, right, you see this nice little bottom down here, and"
"1708800","1713760"," you can see how long it takes, specifically it's a good one right here, this is December 28th, you"
"1713760","1719500"," can see that the market breadth down below, right, took some time for us to hit an actual bottom"
"1719500","1724720"," down here, okay, what the cool part about this indicator is, if you scroll back, then it takes some"
"1724720","1730180"," time, we're going to go back to a better time here, this is, what is that, 2020, let's look at"
"1730180","1738800"," 2020 real quick, okay, and you can see this, this, this move was fast, okay, but you can also see"
"1738800","1744580"," that the market breadth proved itself, even in that short time frame, so what is this telling you"

"1800680","1809280"," start slamming down in here, you know that you can buy, you can buy call spreads in the market, you"
"1809280","1813300"," don't even have to, and you can see this move right here, you don't even have to get aggressive,"
"1813540","1817620"," you just buying stock, and you're buying call spreads that are dated a month, three months out,"
"1818020","1822020"," that's all you're doing, you want to get aggressive in here on one of these bottoms, you wait until"
"1822020","1826960"," it's confirmed that we're going up, okay, to start taking on more aggressive positioning, you want"
"1826960","1832040"," to know when to sell, now you get this big red line up here, and this kind of tells you"
"1832040","1836220"," where to sell, but you can snap your own lines, you can make a, you can make, I think you,"
"1836300","1839980"," I think on this one, you can make a line, let me see right here, you make your own line"
"1839980","1844440"," right here, boom, you added your own line in, right, and this is going to show you when you should"
"1844440","1851100"," start selling, right, or at least be not, or not be as aggressive in your lungs, right, so we know"
"1851100","1859580"," about this one right here, the other key about this, this indicator is that you can see here that"
"1859580","1866160"," the aggressiveness, right, the aggressiveness, here's the, the aggressive part is moved, is over"
"1866160","1871060"," currently, and we're going to talk about some other indicators to add to this chart so that you can"
"1871060","1876680"," look deeper when you're like, hey, Cap, I want to be long here, you can see yesterday, we came down"
"1876680","1883000"," slightly to this 778, now at the end, I'm like, hey, you should buy some calls at the bell, it'll"
"1883000","1884500"," probably work out for you, why is that?"
"1884720","1889300"," Because I was looking at some other indicators, now here's another key, okay, here's another key,"
"1889440","1894360"," look at this one right here, we came up here back in April of 2021, right, and we, we didn't"
"1894360","1899340"," quite touch, we got nice and high, right, but then we kind of started to drift higher, right, drift"
"1899340","1906100"," higher, and the market started to lose its breadth here, but we continued higher, right, so even if"
"1906100","1908580"," we're right here right now, what does this show you here?"
"1908980","1914360"," This shows you that even if we continue higher, let's say to 460, from, from now, right, let's say"
"1914360","1921260"," he's drying higher into the end of the month, we're still going to have this roll-off portion of"
"1921260","1928060"," the month, okay, so either now through the 31st or after the 31st, you're more than likely going to"
"1928060","1931960"," get some kind of a roll over here, so when you're like, hey, I'm a bold Cap, right, well, you"
"1931960","1935780"," want to go on Twitter, you want to pump this shit up all day long, then this isn't the time"
"1935780","1937520"," for you to be pumping this shit up, is it?"
"1937940","1942720"," If you were already long down here, you could extend this, you can extend this, you could buy this"
"1942720","1947040"," for another week or so or a day down here, if you think we're going to continue on higher, there"
"1947040","1950700"," are other indicators that you know are out there to say, hey, should I actually be buying, so if"
"1950700","1955520"," you're a bull, you like shit, this is where you should be being a bull down here, where my cursor"
"1955520","1961260"," is, if you're a bull up here, I'm sorry to tell you, but at some point, even if we grind"
"1961260","1967800"," higher, so we grind higher to 459, we're going to roll at some point to some extent. "
"1969380","1973740"," If you're a bear, you're looking for these numbers, right, if you're a bear, where are you looking"

"1984080","1988860"," thinking about throwing on some put spreads, right, I'm going to start adding some put spreads on"
"1988860","1993660"," here, cap and the money, right, and then you're going to wait for that rollover to continue and to"
"1993660","1997740"," move down and down and down and down, right, and where do you get that, where do you get that"

"2101450","2106010"," volume is added to the cumulative OBD total, if price went down when that day's volume is"
"2106010","2110850"," attractive from the OBD of total, the value is then plotted as a line for easy interpretation, on"
"2110850","2114970"," balance volume is probably used to confirm or identify overall price trends, or anticipate price"
"2114970","2120070"," movements, movements after divergences, right, I'm going to scroll to close this one right there,"
"2121710","2130190"," and you're going to see down here, right, that the the OBD line is still down, okay, even though,"
"2130610","2136590"," even though we've traded higher, hey, notice how that OBD is not telling the same story, it's"
"2136590","2143430"," telling you that we have this big squeeze up here, and we still don't have major buyers in the"
"2143430","2149710"," market, this tells you two things, one, this rally could be false, and also two, if you want us, if"
"2149710","2155810"," people say we still have more room to squeeze higher, that would mean that we need to see more"
"2155810","2162310"," volume, more buyers, except into this market for us to squeeze higher where we are, okay, next one"
"2162310","2167790"," I'm going to show you here is the, let me see, I'm going to show you the arms index next,"

"2184680","2191340"," we have two charts below saying that we could, this that we are set up to either grind higher, the"
"2191340","2197100"," buyers still haven't come in, we could still move higher here, right, so this is, this is not"
"2197100","2202980"," showing the same as this chart above here, this, we have divergences in the OBV and in the trend,"
"2203700","2208000"," I'm going to show you another one here, you should be looking at as well, this is your advanced"

"2223780","2228520"," going to look at the advanced decline line and it's showing the same thing, right, it's showing"
"2228520","2235320"," that we are lower, we still haven't had the advanced decliner, the, the advances get high enough"
"2235320","2239860"," here, you see how high they are right here for this strong move higher, this is indicating that a"
"2239860","2245040"," lot of buyers still have not stepped into the market, want to be aware of that they're, that the"
"2245040","2251600"," push up higher right now is still a low volume push up, but this is telling it, there's still"
"2251600","2256700"," buyers waiting to enter this, this market here, there's still a divergence here on the advanced"
"2256700","2261300"," decliner line, the next one that I want to show you is the, I showed you the arms, I showed"
"2261300","2264860"," you the unbalanced, I showed you the advanced decliner, and the last one I want to show you is the"

"2303250","2311130"," indicators underneath, or within, or within I should say, this first one, this market breadth"
"2311130","2316370"," indicator, even though we're high right now, saying they were waiting for buyers to come in, so"
"2316370","2321410"," this is kind of in the background telling you exactly what's spot gammas telling you this morning,"
"2322150","2327730"," is that for this push to go higher, we need more money to come into this market, and there is"
"2327730","2333290"," money available for this market to shoot higher, so maybe they're just waiting for a better price,"
"2333290","2340010"," maybe it's 435, maybe it's 440, we'll find out today, but I want you to use this here specifically,"
"2340570","2346070"," because if you're wondering out there, should I be buying right now cap, my truthful answer to you"
"2346070","2351910"," is, I don't know, but I can tell you one thing, when it gets down here right, when it, when"
"2351910","2357510"," it starts to come down here, watch my cursor down here, that is the time to buy, so even if"
"2357510","2362530"," we'd grind higher, even if you miss a squeeze higher, even if you, let's say we trade to 460, and"
"2362530","2367670"," you miss this, maybe it's time to sit out from the market, and just watch this indicator, if you"
"2367670","2374090"," were to watch this one indicator, you would have the ability to time what's actually a bottom,"
"2374310","2379610"," where you can feel safe buying something, and then make decisions down the road from there, you"
"2379610","2384390"," can, in a matter of fact, if you bought this down here, you already know that you have, this is"
"2384390","2389770"," the time for you to take your profit off the table, you could not trade day in, day out, you"

"2403350","2407050"," grind higher, if we're going to squeeze higher, if there's more room, if the volume's going to"
"2407050","2410790"," clean the market to buy, and just say this is what I'm going to do, I'm going to sit back"

"2956730","2965790"," to sell below 435, so my take is, currently my take is, at least until the first, I think that"
"2965790","2974450"," you could probably get away with a 435C into the first, now, and I said yesterday, I said you have"
"2974450","2978450"," bigger problems if it's below there on the first, and you know, so if you burn, let's say you burn"

"3012870","3019570"," you're going to sell it, so we see some weakness off the bell currently, the book's a little bit"
"3019570","3025630"," thin right now on both sides, you're not seeing too much, too much of too much volume currently,"
"3025630","3033690"," looks like some dip buyers down below here at 444.50, again down at 443, take a little, you can"
"3033690","3037750"," start to see this shaping up, there is a little bit of, there is some support here going down at"
"3037750","3043670"," 443, so we do trade lower, maybe snap a line for this 443 area down here, you don't want to"

"3504970","3512770"," see in modern warfare right, amongst first world countries or first world ask countries, we don't"
"3512770","3519670"," see much modern warfare today, the only thing that I can compare it to is Fallujah, there was three"
"3519670","3528610"," battles in Fallujah, and in those battles had they been sustained, the Fallujah, they dropped"
"3528610","3532270"," pamphlets, the Syops, they dropped these pamphlets to get the fuck on on and go to refugee camps"
"3532270","3537650"," and shit before US forces go in, but you have to understand if that was sustained over a period of"
"3537650","3545450"," time with civilians, they're there and even soldiers that aren't pulled from battle, once you're"
"3545450","3553990"," worn out right, it's it's it's pre-sided, when you have, it doesn't matter if it's Russians or"
"3553990","3560310"," Ukrainians, soldiers, some female soldiers at this point, Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, but then"
"3560310","3565130"," you're adding in civilians into the mix, in modern warfare, amongst two first world countries, the"
"3565130","3571190"," sustainment of that, of that fighting, the closest they can describe it to be Fallujah, and even"
"3571190","3577110"," that wasn't two modern armies fighting, it was just really one-sided with but it was against a"
"3577110","3583930"," force that was willing to fight, but the key is that when you're in that sustained fighting, it's"
"3583930","3589690"," you can only sustain it for a period of time, it's been going on now for a month and you"
"3589690","3597550"," figure three weeks, another month or so, it really you're gonna see a breakdown in not just with"
"3597550","3604030"," not just with Ukrainians, but you will see a breakdown even with amongst Russian soldiers, constant"
"3604030","3612730"," shelling, constant barrages, no food, no water, you get it gets real dirty and your mentality, you"
"3612730","3620710"," have you guys ever seen these old videos of veterans from World War I, it's weird and on social"
"3620710","3627390"," media they'll say oh this is what PTSD used to be called, right, shell shock, it's not really the"
"3627390","3633650"," case, there's a difference in shell shock and I know that medically there's no difference, but I do"
"3633650","3642110"," warn you that shell shock to me at least is a lot different and when you're into this con, it's"
"3642110","3645210"," not just the constant, there is a constant fear when you're holding your weapon all the time,"
"3645530","3651510"," you've got some small incoming fire and a fob or something, but it's not quite like being"
"3651510","3657310"," constantly shelled at all times, not quite like being, they've got drones that are just knocking"
"3657310","3662590"," out columns left and right for Russians as well, they're not being fed, they're cold, they have"
"3662590","3672110"," their reports of frostbite, you know that when you're, that kind of severe environment for"
"3672110","3676890"," a long period of, it's weird, I've been in a, I was in a program and I was in this"
"3676890","3683890"," other program where they treat you like you're, I figure what it's called now, but they told us"
"3683890","3688990"," that we'd been, they put us under this lockdown shit and then they told us that new World War III"
"3688990","3692970"," had started, they cut off all communications that our families on shit, this sort of really fucked"
"3692970","3698950"," up psychology shit they put you through and it's so that you don't it's training for in case"
"3698950","3706090"," you're, you're taken as a prisoner of war and stuff like that and you know just a couple weeks of"
"3706090","3711830"," that, two, three weeks of that is it fucks your brain up and real bad and you, but when in"
"3711830","3717770"," the real when it really happens, it's even worse, so I don't see, so you're getting real negative"
"3717770","3722650"," in the news right now, I truly think that no matter how negative they get that you're going to see"
"3722650","3728370"," a association of fighting, I want to call it, so last week I said, last Friday I think I said"
"3728370","3733490"," it, so let's call like mid-April, it'd be about three weeks, I don't think it lasts much longer"
"3733490","3737830"," than that, it could, I've heard people say that it could be guerrilla fighting, all that kind of"
"3737830","3742890"," stuff, but I doubt it, I'm telling you that this kind of fighting is absolutely fucking brutal,"
"3743430","3749630"," it's, I don't think we've seen fighting like that in modern times amongst first world countries,"
"3749990","3757830"," you'll see like real nasty death in Africa, Darfur and stuff, in the 1990s, mass death and stuff"
"3757830","3761990"," like that, but those are different people, you guys, any guys out there never lived in a first"
"3761990","3765970"," world country, second world third world, not always to me, most of you guys have lived in first"
"3765970","3770310"," world countries and most of your lives, but what's acceptable and how you live is different than"
"3770310","3775030"," there, believe it or not, right, living in a real third world country, life is different, but"
"3775030","3782710"," amongst first world nations of some kind, somewhat first world nations, this kind of fighting is,"
"3782830","3790390"," can't be sustained, I don't see, I don't think that it can be this level of fighting, and I don't"
"3790390","3798770"," think, I don't think if you saw the US fight like China or US fight another nation like Korea or"
"3798770","3804330"," China or Russia, you would see, this is even different in the 1950s I think, it's more akin to like"
"3804330","3811010"," World War One, it's more akin to fire bombings that took place in Germany, in Diningland believe it"
"3811010","3814970"," or not, you know, and you look back at old videos, these people, they're fucked up for the rest of"
"3814970","3819630"," their lives, they don't ever come back from it, it's not like PTSD I've got, it's the PTSD, I have"
"3819630","3827130"," an uncle that was hospitalized for shell shock, when I was, he died when I was young, like I was"
"3827130","3834670"," like 10 when he died, but when I was young, I mean, he never came back from that, never ever"
"3834670","3841750"," ever came back, he was gone, gone gone, and I think that if you start to see that, start to"
"3841750","3849070"," see that breakdown within soldiers and the society, there'll be nothing they can do, but stop the"

"4236620","4243300"," And, uh, they lock the doors behind them and then they chain, uh, the chain the doors. "
"4243580","4246240"," I don't know if I just tell these stories, but it's been a, it's been a long time ago."
"4246240","4251240"," So they chained the doors on us and they lock them and they've got every exit."
"4251240","4259560"," It's got my military police and our, our CO came out, our battalion, CO came out and marches up to"
"4259560","4259900"," the stage. "
"4259900","4266080"," And he's like, uh, matter of fact, he usually said, some tactical nukes had been set off in Europe"
"4266080","4267600"," and Eastern block, uh, Europe, right?"
"4268420","4273880"," Uh, had launched some nukes, small tactical nuclear weapons and that war had started."
"4276340","4280280"," And then all of our, all of our MOSs were now fucking nothing."
"4281100","4283240"," And everybody there was going to be an 11 bang bang. "
"4284880","4287480"," And we were, uh, getting on a plane right away."
"4288220","4293140"," Uh, they were going to march us to our barracks, grab our shit, and, uh, we're going straight to"
"4293140","4293360"," Europe."
"4294040","4296500"," And that we couldn't contact, uh, the World War three had started. "
"4297520","4300080"," And it was all kinds of bad stuff too, right?"
"4300420","4304240"," Like people are dying, blah, blah, uh, this risk to the United States, the conas."
"4305240","4306700"," You can't tell anybody."
"4307380","4308500"," Can't talk to your families. "
"4308900","4310360"," You're just getting on a fucking flight right now."
"4310380","4311840"," I was like, I see one 30, get on the fucking tarmac."
"4312220","4316300"," If I go in a permanent, I see one 30, I see globe masters, um, and you're fucking out of"
"4316300","4316460"," here. "
"4318600","4320460"," And, uh, you're fucking just gone."
"4321500","4325160"," Uh, the next fucking four hours or something stupid like that."
"4326280","4331420"," And as they're doing this to us, uh, we're figured this is true, right?"
"4331680","4334220"," Because we don't know anything. "
"4334280","4334960"," And that could happen anytime."
"4335200","4338600"," That's one of your worst fears as a World War three starts on your soldier that you want in the"
"4338600","4339060"," back of your mind."
"4339060","4339820"," You always think about that. "
"4340740","4344240"," Um, as a matter of fact, I had some similar situation happen to me when I was in the army."
"4344340","4346820"," That's a different story, um, where I thought I was going to die."
"4347020","4352560"," But, uh, this one specifically, you're not thinking like your mind is slow, you're tired, cold,"
"4352880","4357060"," hungry, uh, you've been beaten down and they've they're literally training you for this one moment. "
"4357200","4358940"," So I'm into this, in this meeting."
"4360720","4366180"," And they at one moment, they say to the battalion, uh, the training officers, the battalion, if"
"4366180","4368960"," you're not ready to commit yourself to this right now, right?"
"4369420","4373000"," We want you to, uh, if you're content to objector at this point, we'd have you sign your all your"
"4373000","4374500"," insurance and update all your insurance shit."
"4374680","4376900"," If your conscience is objector, we didn't need to know right now. "
"4377120","4379060"," And we're going to direct you through this door to the left."
"4379700","4382020"," And they slip that into the moment."
"4382880","4391600"," And I shit you not, uh, like 20 or 30 people stood up, like 20 or 30 soldiers stood up"
"4392440","4395120"," and declared themselves conscientious objectors. "
"4395120","4396920"," So this is like, you know, we're thinking this is real."
"4398240","4403180"," And they fucking sent the military police over and they fucking cuffed, handcuffed every one of"
"4403180","4405280"," these motherfuckers zip tied their asses, right?"
"4405820","4406380"," Zip, zip, zip."
"4407440","4411040"," And they led these fucking soldiers outside of our battalion. "
"4412220","4413400"," And they arrested them."
"4414140","4418360"," And I don't know if they arrested them permanently, but I know for shit, sure that I never saw them"
"4418360","4418620"," again."
"4418720","4419020"," I'm a battalion. "
"4419020","4419840"," They're gone."
"4420760","4421240"," Gone."
"4421680","4422360"," They're just gone. "
"4422480","4423380"," We never saw them again."
"4424560","4428200"," And then they revealed that it was, uh, part of the training."
"4429800","4436480"," It was like one of the combinations of the training, uh, that they were laying on us just to, to"
"4436480","4444690"," find out, uh, you know, if we were, I don't know what the fuck it was, like committed or some"
"4444690","4445350"," shit like that. "
"4446090","4447790"," And it was fucking bizarre."
"4448270","4449690"," It was fucking bizarre."
"4450170","4451570"," So we're gonna look at the book map real quick. "
"4454030","4457150"," Where is resistance in book map or at 44604."
"4458750","4461070"," We're gonna be looking for salaries if we can find any above."
"4461470","4463370"," Look for some resistance above here. "
"4463630","4473010"," Get us some some here at 44672 and then 44764, uh, 44846."
"4474950","4476850"," That big bad number up here, right?"
"4478130","4479590"," That's where it's really at it, right?"
"4480410","4482330"," Get some traffic down below here."
"4484850","4487170"," Still showing some some traffic down here. "
"4487290","4488170"," Not that bad though."
"4492280","4493600"," Move this out a little bit."
"4496450","4501510"," I don't know why my, my, I don't know why I might want to change this. "
"4501650","4503550"," I want to cut our current order book."
"4504210","4506030"," This isn't the current order book I'm looking for though."
"4518360","4519540"," Yeah, we can do market depth. "
"4524970","4525910"," We'll go down here."
"4534540","4535960"," I'll get you depth of book here."
"4540840","4541640"," Trade's counter. "
"4542300","4543940"," I don't want trade's counter either."
"4545940","4547600"," Yeah, it's COP."
"4553570","4555930"," If you bring this one straight back again here. "
"4563060","4567320"," There's one specifically that I want and I don't want time and sales."
"4570780","4571980"," No, it's not trade's counter."
"4572160","4572980"," It's not trade's counter. "
"4578400","4581260"," If I reset, I don't know if I want to reset this."
"4593930","4595790"," I think I had some more indicators here this morning."
"4601170","4604170"," Some sellers showing up here currently on the on-spy. "
"4611470","4612530"," Look for a trade lower."
"4614690","4624630"," Let me see what else you guys are"
"4624630","4625250"," saying right now."
"4628810","4631590"," Do you know what the sweet gap is?"
"4631770","4632130"," Get that one. "

"4638270","4641230"," Chase is updating the e-market selling off briefly. "
"4643250","4645170"," I've seen that vid taking over US."
"4645390","4645930"," You didn't see the move."
"4646170","4647950"," I'll look for the interview right now. "
"4647990","4648350"," Bring it up."
"4649830","4650550"," Good morning, John."
"4650750","4650990"," How are you?"

"4655250","4655630"," So get it."
"4655790","4655850"," Yep. "
"4656950","4657570"," You know it's weird too."
"4657570","4664370"," A special central bank confirming stock trading on the Moscow exchange will continue tomorrow."
"4667170","4668830"," I can show Tesla right now. "
"4670470","4672750"," You can get PTSC from all kinds of different ships too."
"4672810","4673910"," It's not like you have to get it from war."
"4674410","4675810"," There's all kinds of ways to get PTSD. "
"4677730","4679370"," So we'll look at Tesla real quick."
"4679370","4684930"," Look at that load up."
"4686550","4688390"," There's not a lot of volume in the market right now. "
"4688890","4689990"," Why you guys to see that, right?"
"4690230","4692090"," The depth of the book is real small right now."
"4703150","4704030"," Stocks to give you PTSD."
"4706850","4710250"," Mary, did you get a chance to, yeah, I like that at Facebook. "
"4710590","4714470"," Yesterday I wanted to buy some Facebook at the bell."
"4714650","4718330"," I was trying to make a decision if I was going to buy Facebook at the bell or if I"
"4718330","4719970"," was going to buy a spy at the bell."
"4720910","4725010"," I want to buy in spy, but I wish now that I'd bought Facebook. "
"4726410","4729930"," I was looking at the strike just before ER."
"4730590","4736810"," I was looking at, oh, sweet."
"4738930","4739450"," Yay. "
"4741290","4742950"," I'm at 15% today."
"4743870","4744390"," Sweet."
"4745570","4747130"," Okay, so I was looking at Facebook. "
"4751770","4755790"," I was looking at, let me tell you guys what I was looking at here."
"4759070","4761810"," I wanted to buy, hold on."
"4775260","4776120"," I should have bought them. "
"4777420","4780180"," Yesterday I was going to buy, fuck, I should have bought them."
"4781320","4785940"," So yesterday I was going to buy April 22nd, 250 C's."
"4786460","4788240"," They were like 80 cents at one point yesterday. "
"4788680","4792280"," They're now $1.24. So I kind of fucked that up."
"4794700","4796060"," I want to buy Facebook."
"4798140","4801460"," So I was looking at options, profit calculator. "
"4802620","4811800"," And I wanted it for a, to sell to"
"4811800","4817240"," bulls for a run into their next ER report."
"4818440","4819400"," 250 C's."
"4819880","4822600"," Looks like whoever was in on them yesterday, some of them have left. "
"4824400","4827660"," So they're moved on to 255 C's for 92 cents."
"4829900","4837060"," For the same date, there's a lot of interest on the, the, the, the, the, the, the options chain for"
"4837060","4838460"," the 29th, just after."
"4839160","4840720"," There's a little too pricey for my blood. "
"4842320","4847100"," But April 22nd, I like it because they're cheap."
"4848240","4851560"," And you can use it, you can sell before, you can use it just on the run up."
"4851840","4854520"," You just trade the run up into the ER for Facebook. "
"4858160","4865950"," And, or I think that's, I think that's saying here that their earning support is between the 22nd"
"4865950","4867510"," and the 29th of April."
"4868350","4871190"," I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what it says or an event."
"4871390","4878290"," Maybe they have an event between 22nd and the 29th for Facebook, but 250 C's were 89 or 80 cents. "
"4878490","4880830"," I think at the low last yesterday, they were like 80 cents."
"4880970","4886350"," They're now at dollar 30 fucking five big widespread on the bid to ask on it."
"4886570","4893370"," Dollar 29 is the low on it, but for all of tech right now, that's my favorite trade is Facebook. "
"4895090","4897870"," Starting to blast higher now on the display."
"4899910","4900710"," Squeeze in here."
"4902590","4904390"," Nice little squeeze higher on the spot. "
"4904390","4909130"," Remember that the first this is resist or this is support right here."
"4909650","4911650"," 447 is actually support."
"4913670","4916030"," So just be conscious of that as we move forward. "
"4919650","4920550"," Could I have that right?"
"4920950","4921750"," I don't know if I have that right."
"4922310","4923610"," I might have, I might have fucked with that."
"4925550","4929650"," I might have fucked with that accident here. "
"4930290","4932090"," Looks squiggling and squiggling."
"4933310","4935310"," Yeah, 4473 is support."
"4938390","4940290"," 4473 right here is actual support. "
"4940710","4941650"," This is S2."
"4941850","4942730"," This is S1."
"4945050","4946830"," So this isn't even resistance here. "
"4947150","4947250"," Right?"
"4947410","4948410"," We got support down here."
"4949070","4949390"," S2."
"4949870","4950670"," This is S1. "
"4950950","4953590"," We'll write these in for you so you guys can see them."
"4962470","4964170"," Do you want to get super bearish or anything?"
"4964170","4965030"," Is this one?"
"4968790","4969790"," Is this two?"
"4971750","4973050"," Nice little recovery here."

"4994810","5000570"," I hope that that indicator from this morning helps you guys."

"10420670","10422530"," Let's just say this is the top right here."
"10422790","10425930"," Let's just say it's the top Right so we come up here. "
"10425990","10428730"," We get a rejection You don't want to buy the short there, right?"
"10428910","10431970"," You want to get confirmation for a leg down, right?"
"10433290","10434590"," Right, that's what you want to get, right?"

"10438090","10442990"," burning off cap Well, even if it does right, it's going to get picked up again And then if it"
"10442990","10449330"," gets rejected a second or a third time, this is actually where you take the short you're not taking"
"10449330","10452070"," it in here Let's just say that's the top, right?"
"10453050","10458190"," It's here that you take it Not right fucking here if you wanted to take it right fucking here for"
"10458190","10464330"," like five minutes for quick 10 20 points sure go have at it If you want to trade safe you"
"10464330","10470150"," take like the second or third one up here You give the bulls one two three chances before you take"
"10470150","10475390"," that short same thing goes if we were on a bottom right here It's the same thing right one two"
"10475390","10482050"," and then to move up or one two three If the power comes in up if the power doesn't come"
"10482050","10486430"," in then it's going to be one two Bulls didn't find it and we go down."
"10486590","10492870"," Okay, so be careful of this as we move forward Right, so the point is this the bulls probably have"
"10492870","10498110"," another chance for at least this And we can tell by a book map that they have more than likely"
"10498110","10500930"," too close You may not have quite four four nine four fifty four."
"10500990","10504790"," I probably have probably have when the sellers really start coming down It's probably like"
"10504790","10509530"," somewhere up in here four four nine three five maybe But they have another leg here. "
"10509930","10513890"," They have another leg here to go for and they're probably going to take at least two more stabs at"
"10513890","10520930"," it And at the least they're going to get a stab here a stab here and then it'll come back"
"10520930","10526430"," down right So if you're bearish here, I would say to you you're looking for at least two rejections"
"10526430","10532650"," minimum To go short if not three If you're a bull here same thing, right?"
"10532970","10534210"," You you you're not done yet."
"10534290","10538730"," We're never done We never sometimes will do this goofy shit up here, but we still continued up,"
"10538890","10539030"," right?"
"10539950","10548310"," So when you're looking for rejection you're looking for like one One two three if at least two But"
"10548310","10552370"," definitely not one often oftentimes traders make this mistake all the time."
"10552450","10553310"," They're like fuck it. "
"10553410","10557870"," I'm going short right here And it's it's it's too early It needs more sometimes."
"10558170","10563510"," Yeah, we'll go up here and just go straight down v shape fucking Turn the market over, but it's"
"10563510","10567430"," just not that common not day in day out not over 10 20 trades."
"10567670","10573230"," Okay, so over 10 20 trades You're gonna be looking for a rejection point one here You look for one"
"10573230","10578310"," here if you don't get the one here and we continue up then you have to count this again one"
"10579350","10585730"," Two and then three Okay So you're you're looking for confirmation as a bear that this you're gonna"
"10585730","10594700"," get a reversal here If you don't get that confirmation, this shit's still long right now I hope"
"10594700","10603390"," that helps All right, I'll break back. "
"10603470","10608390"," I go upstairs and check on some I get some lunch Cooking right now I only came down here because"

"18541740","18546220"," I'm assuming this has to do with liquid natural gas."
"18546240","18554700"," Hold on."
"18554900","18556600"," Watching rig right now as well. "
"18558990","18568230"," My assumption is that all these gas oil refiners, producers, drillers are going to catch a bid"
"18568230","18568510"," here."
"18605450","18610230"," Any of the offshore oil drinking looks like they might catch a bid."
"18610230","18616630"," Rig hasn't yet ripped but I would take a look at rig next to see if it can catch a"
"18616630","18617510"," bit here. "
"18619730","18621930"," Not much on the Biden presser."
"18622010","18622990"," That was a big nothing burger."
"18646270","18647970"," Kwebs starting to curl over here. "
"18656490","18658010"," USO did catch a bid though."
"18659550","18666630"," They were on the lows down here at 80.08. Making the way higher now."
"18670410","18671510"," You like to see it. "
"18671590","18672550"," This looks familiar, right?"
"18672790","18673610"," You see it back here?"
"18676650","18679030"," We kind of lost the move here, right?"
"18679230","18680610"," So maybe down somewhere in here."
"18681810","18684410"," I wanted to see it go lower here but I didn't."
"18690460","18692100"," Nothing that's been said today. "
"18692920","18693660"," It's showing."
"18694160","18699380"," So the news today is basically saying that we're slightly lower on our natural gas reserves."
"18700000","18703760"," Canada is saying they're going to provide some oil but in reality it's a drop in the bucket. "
"18705000","18706680"," It's a couple days worth of oil."
"18707060","18714320"," So if you want to be long, that oil trade, we're not seeing any news out of Russia or Ukraine"
"18714320","18715900"," of cessation of hostilities."
"18716620","18721840"," So in the reality is that there's nothing that the G7 that what they can do, right?"
"18722100","18723500"," So USO is catching a bid right now. "
"18723520","18725540"," I want you guys to understand out there fully that."
"18726260","18730820"," The US are the G7 can't do shit, okay?"
"18731840","18737120"," And then they're going to make these proclamations that they're going to provide or step up oil"
"18737120","18738260"," production, gas production."
"18738640","18742000"," But the reality is that they can't or they can't make a dent. "
"18743580","18748000"," I mean, the stepping up of oil and gas production in Canada is not even enough for their own"
"18748000","18748800"," country to use."
"18749480","18751640"," And there's nothing really that the US can do either."
"18752040","18757240"," And producers have been getting fucked for a couple of years or longer than that but over the"
"18757240","18757480"," years. "
"18757800","18762840"," And you'll see these boom and bust cycles in the oil and gas production where they dump tons of"
"18762840","18770940"," money in its oil and gas production, drilling, research, all this other stuff."
"18771120","18772480"," We're not just not in that cycle right now."
"18772500","18778140"," For all the money that's been spent on that, they're looking to get max profits, right?"
"18778340","18780040"," I would be looking to get max profits as well. "
"18780640","18782700"," Now, what if the war ends next month?"
"18782820","18785720"," Can you imagine being or owning something?"
"18786100","18791700"," Let's say you own, I don't know, a landscaping company and some guy says"
"18791700","18798840"," to you, that's a big moment every week."
"18799320","18801760"," And you say, sure, that's a big, that's a big moment for me."
"18802120","18803120"," I've only got three guys. "
"18803360","18804660"," That means I got to hire another 10 guys."
"18805100","18809820"," So you go to the guy and you say, okay, well, I'll do it, but I have to hire by"
"18809820","18810340"," all this equipment."
"18810360","18812960"," They got to take out some credit and all this other bullshit. "
"18813440","18817000"," And you say to the guy, alright, for that 100, let's say it's 100,000 acres."
"18817500","18819140"," Let's say it's that big, 100,000 acres."
"18819720","18824160"," And you're like, I want you to sign an agreement that you're going to do this for whatever I"
"18824160","18827200"," calculated, my interest payments and all this equipment is going to be. "
"18827380","18828840"," And then I'll, you know, pay me to pay all my people."
"18829300","18832180"," And for my waste and my time and my effort, I want you to sign a five-year contract."
"18833100","18837360"," And of course, they're going to tell you, fuck you ain't signing that five-year contract. "
"18837660","18840340"," I might be selling, or fuck you ain't signing that five-year contract."
"18840720","18842360"," You know, whatever, you don't know the reason behind it."
"18843400","18845020"," So you can't take that contract on. "
"18845400","18850340"," You can't expand your business like that, just as some guy promises you 100,000 acres."
"18850660","18852540"," And that's pretty much where we are right now, right?"
"18852540","18858900"," Because you figure if the Ukraine rush the conflict ends anywhere in the next three weeks, let's"
"18858900","18859960"," say it ends in the next six months."
"18861140","18862860"," And you know how that goes, right?"
"18863000","18867660"," The moment that their hostilities are ended, you've got greed everywhere. "
"18868760","18869800"," You've got greed everywhere."
"18870760","18873020"," That doesn't mean oil and gas prices come down right away."
"18873140","18878360"," We know that it's like the, we know that it's the elevator up and the feather down, right?"
"18878360","18882120"," The gas prices will stay high even after it ends. "
"18882340","18889580"," But don't think for a minute that anyone's going to invest in drilling new oil or anything like"
"18889580","18896540"," that on you having a hard time paying gas and oil high prices for the next three months or six"
"18896540","18897300"," months or a year."
"18897560","18899840"," And even with inflation, it just being high."
"18900000","18900800"," It just isn't going to happen. "
"18901560","18902040"," Okay."
"18902140","18905720"," What anybody says, they can say and threaten do whatever they want."
"18905720","18908180"," So there's nothing they can do. "
"18908420","18909740"," Oil prices are probably going to keep going up."
"18909800","18912080"," The old trade and gas trade is still on as far as I can see."
"18912560","18913860"," There's nothing to take it down. "
"18914060","18915380"," IWM calls coming in right now."
"18915800","18923300"," March 25th, 207 C sweeps 98,000, 59,000, 82,000 dollars."
"18923920","18926700"," You know, this is the same old game to some extent out there. "
"18927320","18929560"," This is the game where this is the game."
"18930000","18932700"," This is what makes me think is that it's the same fucking game as before."
"18933200","18941560"," They're going to try to do the J-Pound the Fed is going to try it to massage inflation as"
"18941560","18943280"," long as they can until the presidential election. "
"18944760","18946180"," They ain't going to get that hawkish."
"18947420","18949340"," You know that we're calling them on this, right?"
"18950400","18954900"," We know that what they're going to try to do is try to extend this market as long as they"
"18954900","18955760"," possibly fucking can."
"18956560","18958500"," There'll be ups and downs, ups and downs, volatility. "
"18959860","18966980"," They're going to try to squeeze this out and try to push off a recession as long as they possibly"
"18966980","18967600"," fucking can."
"18968020","18969380"," Because they know it's coming one way or another."
"18969780","18975080"," They're either going to stop the money flow, institute QT, which they just keep talking about. "
"18975660","18978260"," You know they're going to raise rates, right?"
"18978860","18982840"," And they're going to push off a recession as far as they think that they put human possibly can."
"18982960","18984640"," If that's two years, it's two years."
"18986360","18987960"," Meanwhile, everything's going to go higher. "
"18989080","18990620"," Everything you're going to be paying more for everything."
"18991160","18992220"," You'll be working harder."
"18992820","18995220"," And you know, we all know the story of what's going to happen. "
"18995900","18999800"," And if you think that they're going to do the right thing that they aren't, or it doesn't look like"
"18999800","19002860"," it right now, they're not doing the right thing with oil and gas right now."
"19003600","19003920"," Right?"
"19004320","19006360"," So, you know, it's all bullshit."
"19007580","19008780"," Sorry, I shouldn't say that. "
"19009780","19010680"," So what does that mean?"
"19010680","19014180"," I think it was talking to accounts blown up yesterday."
"19015080","19016380"," And I was like, you know what that means?"
"19018280","19020540"," For everything that I'm looking at right now, you know what it means?"
"19020800","19023140"," It means it's like you have a gun to your head if you're an investor."
"19023640","19026900"," They got a gun to your head and they're like, you have to invest in the stock market. "
"19027600","19031560"," If you don't invest in the stock market, you're going to lose your money anywhere else."
"19032880","19034740"," And then we're going to pull the fucking rug out from you."
"19035260","19036600"," And you're not going to know when it's coming. "
"19037440","19039220"," So get in the middle of the classroom."
"19039580","19040280"," Turn the music on."
"19040680","19043280"," Pull one of those chairs away and start dancing. "
"19045780","19047040"," Start walking in a circle."
"19049360","19050180"," That's my thought."
"19051700","19054900"," And I think the market's calling them out in this. "
"19058160","19060480"," Put your money in the market now as they're telling them."
"19062060","19067160"," You know, and you got the, it's like the meme, the meme Jeff where the guy with the guy tosses"
"19067160","19068160"," his papers at his desk."
"19068740","19069840"," And that's the bond market. "
"19070100","19071140"," They're like, motherfucker."
"19072660","19075880"," I can't believe that they're forcing them to buy this, buy the equities market."
"19080070","19083750"," Even if we go to, if we went down to date at 4.35, I'd still believe this story. "
"19084650","19085690"," I still believe that story."
"19085870","19087190"," They're forcing you to buy the equities market."
"19087870","19088230"," You have a choice. "
"19089130","19090850"," And buy oil and gas is what they're saying too."
"19091310","19093210"," Everything today says buy oil and gas."
"19100970","19101570"," Come on. "
"19101990","19102830"," I mean, let's be serious."
"19104310","19105250"," Let's be serious."
"19108030","19109230"," I'm not saying it's right. "
"19109910","19111650"," I'm not saying that they're not going to raise rates."
"19112490","19114130"," I'm not saying that they're not going to do any of this stuff."
"19114270","19114970"," But you know what they're doing?"
"19115650","19116750"," They're trying to manipulate it. "
"19117090","19118510"," That's what they're trying to fucking do."
"19121050","19124250"," And it's comical because we all know that how it ends."
"19124850","19126050"," We all know how it ends. "
"19129210","19130370"," It ends the same way every time."
"19132150","19133510"," But they got a gun to your head."
"19134090","19135110"," That's the fucked up part. "
"19135950","19137050"," You ain't got nowhere else."
"19137170","19137610"," You can go."
"19138430","19140350"," There ain't nowhere else for you to go. "
"19140630","19141910"," Put your money in the stock market."
"19143150","19143710"," There's nothing."
"19144030","19147170"," You tell me where you can go, where you can put your money. "
"19147750","19149930"," You can put your money in real estate right now."
"19150150","19151330"," And that's the other funny part."
"19151690","19153930"," If you read the news stories right now, they're telling you point blank. "
"19154130","19157690"," They're saying that housing prices are going to continue to go up."
"19158430","19162590"," So they're trying to reassure you, if you're wealthy, invest."
"19163830","19164690"," Keep buying. "
"19165070","19166410"," Keep spending money on investments."
"19167390","19168350"," Keep buying houses."
"19168690","19169410"," Keep buying stocks. "
"19170350","19171370"," That's what they're telling you right now."
"19172310","19173230"," It's fucking wild."
"19175030","19176470"," And someone in Stream said it. "
"19176590","19177630"," And it was such a beautiful statement."
"19178190","19179730"," It was like, it was just a few words, right?"
"19181230","19186150"," They gave, they gave Jay Powell the choice between inflation or recession."
"19186930","19188410"," And he chose inflation. "
"19190130","19190890"," That's what he did."
"19190950","19191570"," He chose inflation."
"19193890","19194830"," He chose inflation. "
"19195410","19197430"," Cause even 50 BPS think going to do it."
"19198150","19199310"," I mean, you guys, you guys."
"19200970","19204950"," Like they're going to need to put, they're going to need like 20% interest rates to fight"
"19204950","19205370"," inflation. "
"19207710","19208170"," 20%."
"19209350","19211830"," Do you think fucking two or 3% is going to put a dent?"
"19212710","19215150"," Let's talk like, let's, let's talk real."
"19216170","19220170"," Well, if you were, if you were my best friend or my wife or something, and I was the closed"
"19220170","19223490"," room when I was talking to you, I'd be like, look, here's the deal. "
"19225110","19228130"," Unless we raise interest rates to like 20% tomorrow."
"19230050","19230690"," We're fucked."
"19232770","19234010"," So this is what we're going to do. "
"19234150","19234310"," Okay."
"19235910","19238510"," We're going to try to fight inflation as long as we possibly can."
"19238970","19241550"," We'll throw a couple points on here, a couple points on there. "
"19242450","19244290"," We'll try to tame it down as it happens."
"19245410","19247670"," And we'll try to milk this for the next two to three years."
"19248630","19250750"," We'll get you elected or your friend elected or whoever. "
"19251550","19252030"," Okay, honey."
"19253850","19255350"," Otherwise we're fucked right now."
"19256030","19257830"," You want to be fucked right now or fucked in two years?"
"19258490","19261770"," That's pretty much the conversation in the back room that's going on right now. "
"19265930","19266790"," It's awful."
"19267150","19268910"," It's fucking awful, but that's the truth."
"19278520","19279780"," You know what I mean?"
"19280160","19283240"," I mean, that's the truth. "
"19284620","19285820"," And it's shitty to say."
"19287520","19289280"," Because what's two, what's two percent?"
"19289520","19290260"," What's three percent?"
"19291240","19293720"," I mean, what the fuck is 10%, 10% wouldn't stop it."
"19293720","19297120"," Do you think 10% rates would stop inflation right now?"
"19297420","19298120"," You're fucking high. "
"19299420","19300680"," You're fucking smoking crack."
"19301340","19304840"," If you look at the Fred, it's insane."
"19305740","19306760"," We're going to run away trains. "
"19307080","19307720"," So what are they going to do?"
"19307860","19309420"," They're just going to try to tame it as long as they can."
"19310980","19317340"," They'll do it until, you know, you know, you're going to get ER reports that are not worse yet."
"19318340","19320560"," One to three years and one to three years it'll take. "
"19320560","19322760"," Or not with three years, one to two years."
"19323040","19326680"," So roughly as a total, maybe like four to eight ERs."
"19327220","19328380"," Because you'll start hearing it. "
"19328480","19331940"," Like you'll start hearing like, uh, they'll have one bad quarter."
"19332860","19339640"," And then they'll be like, oh, uh, you see Apple saying we're focusing on, on, uh, raising prices."
"19340100","19341220"," Who else just raised prices?"
"19341680","19344660"," Elon Musk just raised prices, quote unquote, as inflation. "
"19345220","19346480"," So you're going to hear that from companies."
"19346520","19347520"," We raised prices."
"19347880","19348700"," Then you're going to hear from companies. "
"19349320","19354460"," Well, we, uh, instead of doing, uh, research and development, we're focusing on our court, our"
"19354460","19355740"," court, our court products, right?"
"19356540","19358320"," So that's saving them money and research and development."
"19358800","19362900"," Then you're going to see another quarter come by and then be like, well, uh, we laid people off."
"19364300","19364700"," Right. "
"19365020","19368340"," So that's another good quarter for me for Wall Street, not mainly Wall Street."
"19368900","19369300"," Right."
"19370020","19374020"," So you'll, you know, that could last anywhere from three to four quarters, six quarters, maybe that"
"19374020","19375060"," all that kind of shit. "
"19375460","19377800"," Could last for like four to six quarters in real time."
"19377800","19382240"," Maybe three quarters in the low end, but then up to six quarters and they'll keep making profits."
"19382400","19383680"," Wall Street will keep pumping. "
"19385000","19392020"," And, uh, you know, meanwhile, you as the, as the, as Joe Blow on Main Street, uh, you know, you're"
"19392020","19393960"," going to have small things happen along the way."
"19394500","19396460"," Your rates are going to get higher."
"19397640","19398960"," And people can't afford homes anymore. "
"19400660","19402700"," Then the housing prices will start to dip."
"19403260","19403880"," It'll take time."
"19404240","19407460"," You'll see your neighbor's house will be now worth 10% less. "
"19407800","19411400"," Then 20, then 30 and you'll start seeing houses getting sold for less."
"19411640","19413080"," You'll see foreclosures happen."
"19413220","19417080"," That takes time and you're going to see, you know, you're going to lose your job that you had that"
"19417080","19419900"," once great job you had or you might age out, right?"
"19420220","19421640"," You might be like 4550. "
"19421640","19422740"," You can't lose your job now."
"19423760","19426580"," And so, you know, you can't dare to lose your job."
"19426600","19427760"," You can't be replaced with it. "
"19427880","19429340"," Now you're making too much money."
"19429980","19435200"," So you get, you get told, Hey, take an early out and we'll pay you to take an early out."
"19435200","19436400"," Think you're going to get hired somewhere else. "
"19436480","19437160"," No one's iron anymore."
"19438580","19439020"," Right?"
"19439640","19441120"," And you start seeing wage stack inflation."
"19441240","19442160"," You can't keep up with inflation. "
"19442480","19443120"," Yadda yadda."
"19443140","19444200"," Food prices go up."
"19444440","19445200"," Gas goes up. "
"19446060","19446960"," But that takes time."
"19447460","19452300"," And even if that's happening on Main Street, it doesn't impact Wall Street."
"19454880","19455580"," Not yet. "
"19455880","19457240"," That impacts Wall Street later."
"19459100","19461920"," Meanwhile, while this is going on, you've got money in the bank."
"19462160","19462720"," You have to put it somewhere. "
"19462720","19464780"," Your money has to beat inflation."
"19465760","19468900"," And the only place your money's beat inflation is in your 401k."
"19469280","19473720"," It's only beat inflation by you buying the stock market, whatever you're buying. "
"19474120","19476340"," Any kind of product you're buying, you have to."
"19476440","19476900"," You don't have a choice."
"19477180","19477680"," I bet you. "
"19478460","19479400"," I bet you."
"19480980","19482100"," I bet you."
"19483000","19487280"," If you sum up someone managing your money, I'm going to tell you that same fucking thing. "
"19489220","19490820"," I bet you that gets better the phone town."
"19492940","19494460"," I almost guarantee it."
"19494900","19496000"," There's nowhere else you can put your money. "
"19497060","19498340"," Where else can you put your money?"
"19498700","19499880"," You put and be and put into a corner."
"19501100","19501900"," We got no choice."
"19502660","19503480"," Vic's falling now. "
"19504100","19504500"," 2226."
"19507800","19511800"," Spy coming back to retest the previous high of the day."
"19512400","19515080"," $44.94 trying to retest right now. "
"19515160","19515580"," We had a rejection."
"19516380","19516700"," This is one."
"19517120","19517580"," This is two. "
"19518220","19519920"," You want to see a break higher here into the close."
"19519920","19523940"," If you don't see the break higher here and you see the inter-day double top."
"19524600","19527280"," You'll hear the bears telling you, we got an inter-day double top here. "
"19529140","19533770"," You see the concentration right now."
"19536200","19539680"," You can see the concentration right now in the CDP over here."
"19545210","19550710"," See when the upper end here of buyers pushing to break above the previous high. "
"19551350","19551630"," Very push."
"19551930","19552190"," Lower lows."
"19552810","19553070"," Excuse me. "
"19553090","19554170"," Higher lows all day long."
"19554170","19554410"," Right?"
"19554490","19555250"," Higher low at the open."
"19555470","19557010"," Higher low at 11 o'clock. "
"19557210","19559030"," Another higher low at one o'clock this afternoon."
"19561910","19563210"," Pulls one to push it up and over."
"19570990","19571750"," How's everybody doing?"
"19571910","19572650"," Dan, good to see you brother. "
"19573650","19574090"," How you been?"
"19576150","19577890"," Jade Pastor wants to start shorting."
"19580250","19582370"," We got an inter-day double top here, Cap."
"19588930","19590030"," Yeah, and they fucking crash. "
"19590230","19590970"," Well, that's the other thing."
"19590970","19592910"," And this is the other thing."
"19593070","19597270"," The other thing, while all this is going on and you listen to me jabber in the background, there's"
"19597270","19598530"," one other thing going on here. "
"19598850","19604650"," This morning when we were looking at the undercarriage of the market breadth indicator and we said,"
"19604950","19607290"," hey, there's more money that can come into this."
"19607610","19610310"," We know there's more money that can come to the stock market, right?"
"19611450","19612890"," For the market to go up here."
"19613770","19615630"," Now, if it doesn't come to the market, right?"
"19615950","19616790"," Spock, I never noted this. "
"19617190","19620610"," If it doesn't come to the market that the market will begin to roll over."
"19621370","19625470"," But that there is lots of money in the sidelines that can come in."
"19625870","19630990"," Now, if the money isn't coming in here, where is it going into?"
"19631450","19634870"," So that's going to be tomorrow's topic of conversation in the morning. "
"19635050","19640970"," We are going to look at the money quote unquote on the sidelines and try to find out where is"
"19640970","19641410"," it going."
"19642490","19647250"," Because if it's not coming in, and this is a good case because if this is the top of the"
"19647250","19651730"," market and the top of the money flow into the market, where is the money going?"
"19652810","19653790"," What are they buying?"
"19653990","19655350"," We know that they're buying oil and gas."
"19656850","19658190"," We know they're buying gold. "
"19659330","19661010"," We know that Putin wants you to buy Bitcoin."
"19662770","19667250"," So the question becomes, are they going to remove it from those places and put it into the equity"
"19667250","19667650"," market?"
"19668310","19675410"," Or is there a shift of money supply from retail and institutional investors somewhere else?"
"19675410","19677130"," And where is that money going?"
"19677610","19681750"," And we're going to talk about that tomorrow because there might be that trade, right?"
"19682190","19682930"," You don't want to get..."
"19682930","19685810"," There's only one way for you to stay in the equity market here."
"19686350","19688850"," And that's where you're going to be actively managing your own money. "
"19689770","19695450"," On that market breath indicator where you buy all those dips and you sell all those rips, right?"
"19695570","19699590"," When you get to the price you want to be at, you sell and then you hold your money in"
"19699590","19702330"," cash, wait for the next dip and you buy that dip."
"19702330","19709770"," If you look back on the 2010 to 2010 or 2018 or so, if you look back on the 80s,"
"19709810","19715150"," you look back on the 70s, you look back on 94, any of those time periods, you pretty much had"
"19715150","19716070"," to actively manage your money."
"19716230","19718170"," And you used to pay people to do that for you. "
"19718730","19724470"," So more than likely, you're going to have to have a more active hand in staying in the equity"
"19724470","19724770"," market."
"19724970","19726750"," You're like, hey cap, fuck gold, I don't want to buy gold."
"19727250","19729450"," Hey cap, I don't want to buy fucking oil, I don't want to buy fucking gas. "
"19729830","19730990"," I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing."
"19730990","19731850"," I understand that."
"19732430","19733450"," I understand that. "
"19733910","19735070"," I understand that 100%."
"19735070","19740730"," If you like, but I really love Tesla and I really love Apple and I really love, you know, whatever"
"19740730","19744310"," shiny company that's actually producing shit and making money, we stay at equities."
"19744670","19748710"," You don't have to leave to go somewhere else, but you have to actively manage your portfolio. "
"19749030","19756810"," At this point, you have to buy the dips and sell the rips as we make our way higher or"
"19756810","19757970"," sideways or even down."
"19757970","19763590"," You guys saw this morning, if you've been tuning in all day long, you saw this morning that when we"
"19763590","19769550"," looked at that market breadth indicator, it doesn't matter if the market's trading up, sideways or"
"19769550","19769870"," down."
"19771290","19778030"," This indicator gives you a place to buy and sell no matter which direction the market heads. "
"19778550","19780830"," So we'll go over that again tomorrow."
"19780850","19785370"," We're going to look at some other things tomorrow, some other places to find out."
"19785370","19789670"," But if that money's never coming back into the equity market right now, and if it's not, right,"
"19790110","19795270"," maybe we can do a split portfolio where we do put some money elsewhere in case that makes those"
"19795270","19801690"," gains that you're expecting from the stock market this year like you got the last two years. "
"19802350","19803950"," So we can play both sides."
"19803990","19810410"," We can even do simple investments or a simple portfolio in case that money never comes back."
"19810410","19814770"," The other part of the money we looked at on the on-balance volume, the advanced decline of the arms"
"19814770","19818630"," list or the arms index, the McClellan summation index. "
"19818950","19820690"," We didn't see that money yet into the market."
"19821190","19822750"," Everybody's waiting for it to come into the market."
"19823010","19824330"," It could be going somewhere else. "
"19824430","19828210"," So we're going to look at those other things tomorrow before the opening bell."
"19829110","19833250"," And also we look forward to, we're going to do a live stream this weekend and we're going to build"
"19833250","19836330"," a volume and market profile on Thinkorswim."
"19836410","19837930"," So hopefully you've signed up for Thinkorswim. "
"19837930","19839570"," Don't fuck around with it."
"19839710","19847410"," Just open one, open an account and we'll go in and we'll build your own scripts this weekend."
"19847750","19848890"," Saturday or Sunday, I'm not sure yet. "
"19848990","19852430"," I'm not sure if I'm when I'm available this weekend at this moment."
"19853270","19854250"," It's still my birthday."
"19854590","19862110"," So I'm going to do my youngest daughter really took care of me for my birthday and she's in school. "
"19862110","19866210"," So I think how it is with young kids are very smart, right?"
"19866450","19867770"," They're learning how to get things in life."
"19868270","19871630"," They learn how to lie so they can cope and stuff like that."
"19871830","19877270"," They learn how to, how to like massage you, right?"
"19877410","19878430"," So they can get something out of you. "
"19878750","19881010"," So what I'm going to do to the shoe is really sweet to me this week."
"19881130","19887630"," So instead of doing something for me this weekend, I'm going to take her out to like a, she likes"
"19887630","19893350"," this place where it's got like laser tag and race cars and all this other nonsense."
"19893770","19894450"," Skiball and stuff. "
"19894670","19898010"," So I'm going to take her there and just spend some money on her on Saturday or Sunday morning."
"19898150","19899170"," I just don't know which day yet."
"19900030","19904670"," So it's my birthday, but I think that she knows that if she's nice to me, that's her birthday. "
"19905790","19906610"," So kids learn."
"19906810","19910150"," That's how kids learn how to cope with life, I guess."
"19913150","19914650"," So I got to do that this weekend. "
"19914650","19918150"," I'm going to be doing the rest of that with you on Saturday or Sunday, building some scripts with"
"19918150","19918310"," you."

"19954230","19960530"," And the best part about that indicator, if you weren't here this morning, is that it doesn't matter"

"20005160","20008260"," You've gotten my call here for the day."
"20008360","20009220"," My call so far."
"20009740","20016120"," Well, I've made a couple calls, but my call right now is because of the support in the market is"
"20016120","20024800"," for this move higher, possibly to 4.51. 4.51, get above 4.50 by end of day. "
"20025500","20026380"," Can the market roll over?"
"20026380","20029380"," You sure it can, but I think we push higher."
"20030200","20036180"," My thought process is that we push higher and then we have a down day, but we were able to"
"20036180","20036940"," trade this new range."
"20036960","20041340"," I think that's the ultimate goal is to get into a new trading range, get into that 4.50 to"
"20041340","20044620"," 4.60 range, even if it rejects and we have to fight our way back up there. "
"20045200","20047000"," We've made it this far, might as well, right?"
"20047460","20048640"," We're kind of already there."
"20048640","20051920"," So I don't see the distribution just yet."
"20052760","20056200"," My thought is that we get up into that 4.50 to 4.60 trading range. "
"20056300","20059100"," 15 minutes, those are the goals of pitch rating in energy markets."
"20059300","20066400"," WTI crude futures of 1.1332 down to about 50 or 1.4%. We're going to try to break."
"20066640","20071500"," Futures are up about 15 cents or two and three quarters percent of five dollars and 38 cents here"
"20071500","20071820"," in the US. "
"20073180","20079360"," Another thing too is if we can't break into 260 to 250 range, they could do it in the after"
"20079360","20079720"," hours."
"20080120","20083320"," If they did it in the after hours, they push us up into this next range."
"20083540","20090640"," Usually in cash market, if you can't do it, the PJ traders will sometimes push it up there and then"
"20090640","20091540"," it will come back down. "
"20091720","20098400"," You could see something, it wouldn't be out of the range of possibility that you see some kind of a"
"20098400","20099120"," push up, right?"
"20099120","20102360"," And then the after hours gets us up here and then we start doing this nonsense."
"20103280","20110520"," We could even trade down below 4.50. Once we're up here, they'll say, because think of it from this"
"20110520","20110860"," way, right?"
"20111300","20116800"," Market wants to go up, cash can't get it there, and even if you're a bearable, it doesn't matter."
"20116920","20118400"," You want to know if this is where we're going. "
"20118640","20122260"," If we're not going up here, then we're going to reject and start trading down."
"20124600","20128880"," We wouldn't be here if there wasn't going to be a check above."
"20129160","20131740"," If we're not going to check and see if this is where we want to be. "
"20132500","20139200"," If we're not going to be trading between 4.50 and 4.60, then there's no point in us being"
"20139200","20139440"," here."
"20140020","20144840"," My call is for a move up higher either now or in the after hours."
"20145100","20146180"," I don't care if we trade down here. "
"20146180","20152040"," My call is for us to trade higher here and at least explore and see if this is where we're"
"20152040","20152580"," supposed to be."
"20153200","20154740"," And we've already been here once before."
"20155260","20161940"," We were here taking another look here, bring this up. "
"20162740","20163780"," We've already been here once."
"20164540","20169480"," You're going to get a second chance for us to explore higher into 4.50. If we get that second"
"20169480","20171080"," rejection, I get all bearish, okay?"
"20171760","20172700"," If that's your double top."
"20172900","20173680"," You want your double top?"
"20173840","20174160"," Here it is. "
"20174340","20178600"," It's right up here at 4.50. If it gets rejected in the overnight, if it gets rejected in the"
"20178600","20184140"," tomorrow or something, then we know we're going to go looking for lower lows or excuse me for a"
"20184140","20186620"," lower number to find the actual support at."
"20187300","20193600"," So I think this is the first tap here and you're looking at your second tap coming up either in"
"20193600","20195160"," cash market or in the overnight."
"20195780","20196620"," It could be today. "
"20196800","20198240"," It could be tomorrow."
"20198460","20199380"," It could be over here."
"20200220","20201820"," But you want to see that second rejection. "
"20201820","20207440"," You want to see that one and that two, even possibly a three, but in reality, you're looking for"
"20207440","20208620"," that second, second try."
"20208900","20214220"," Now, if we don't push up into the 4.50 trading range, watch out."
"20215220","20220280"," That's why I got to tell you, watch out because this is how the market rolls on a macro scale,"
"20220440","20220480"," right?"
"20220640","20223160"," The market explores lower, right?"
"20223700","20224420"," Being bounces off. "
"20225060","20227700"," The market explores higher until it meets real resistance."
"20227700","20233880"," And then it starts to sell off until it finds some support, right, on a more macro scale."
"20234440","20236820"," So I'm going to expect at least one more temp tire. "
"20238100","20242360"," And if we don't get that acceptance up higher, we're going to look for a rejection."
"20243240","20244300"," And the rejection should be fair."
"20244780","20246960"," You know, the rejection will be worth some money. "
"20247180","20249900"," So I just be patient if you're a bear."
"20250700","20252280"," You don't have to call the exact top."
"20252420","20253880"," Let's say we start rolling over right here. "
"20254260","20255880"," Let's just say we start rolling over here."
"20255880","20258580"," You've got time to make your 300 points."
"20258580","20260680"," It doesn't have to be right at this moment, okay?"
"20261020","20265300"," So even if you like pay cap, this is the right shoulder over here. "
"20265400","20267800"," This is the weirdo head over here with an angry face."
"20268540","20270200"," Guy's kind of angry over here."
"20270300","20270620"," He's mad. "
"20272400","20273580"," This is the growling guy."
"20273760","20275780"," He's going to go down, down, down, down, down."
"20276040","20278440"," Even if it does, let's say it goes down. "
"20278540","20282980"," It's still going to come back up at least once more before it continues down."
"20282980","20284600"," So you've got plenty of time to take a short near."
"20286340","20287800"," We've made it this high right now. "
"20288760","20292100"," Expect one more try to go higher at this point."
"20294000","20295260"," All right, there you go."
"20295680","20298940"," I'll be back in 40 minutes. "
"20299660","20303440"," Maybe, yeah, I'll be back at three o'clock unless some fucking crazy happens."
"20303600","20304420"," I'll be back at four o'clock."
"20305060","20305980"," Three o'clock. "
"20307860","20309100"," Hope all is well out there."
"20317960","20321100"," Oh, X is on the mission to the mission from God over here."
"20321220","20321720"," Let's look at X."
"20322560","20323480"," Before I go, we'll do X."
"20326360","20327320"," We'll load X up. "
"20329880","20331040"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"20331800","20332600"," I like it."
"20335080","20336200"," Thanks for shouting out X."
"20338760","20340380"," You have steel, baby, cranking. "
"20341100","20350470"," You want to see if there's a top on X or not?"
"20352750","20354790"," 200 per 100%."
"20356370","20357190"," It's beautiful."
"20357790","20358370"," It's going places. "
"20364430","20367990"," Bounced off resistance here at 38, 3850."
"20369990","20371310"," Lots of traffic here."
"20373070","20374230"," 40 bucks, baby. "
"20375710","20377410"," 24,000 sellers above."
"20378290","20379330"," Keep on grinding."
"20380690","20384010"," 3850, some pretty fairest resistance at 3852. "
"20384610","20387650"," Mark those two places, 3850 and then 40 bucks."
"20398870","20399950"," Pretty close, right?"
"20400110","20401350"," It's only got another $2 to go."
"20402470","20404430"," And you're heading into some pretty fairside resistance there. "
"20407190","20408010"," Right shoulder."
"20411450","20412570"," Which chart?"
"20413390","20414690"," French fraud taters."
"20416410","20418970"," We'll be back. "
"20422750","20424270"," All right."
"20424670","20426330"," I don't even smoke cigarettes either."
"20426690","20427490"," I don't smoke. "
"20427670","20429270"," I get that bourbon scratch."
"20432230","20436010"," I haven't had a drink either since of that rum night."
"20436270","20437430"," Oh, my fuck. "
"20437870","20439750"," Like, I don't know how people can drink rum."
"20440390","20442070"," Oh, getting a little bounce here."
"20442690","20443210"," 2207. "
"20443370","20444550"," Do you make a note right here?"
"20445190","20446130"," Be careful here."
"20446690","20449970"," I didn't even think about this, but the nice round number of $22."
"20449970","20453090"," A little bounce here on the VIX. "
"20456420","20457020"," Uh oh."
"20482630","20483450"," Which one is it?"
"20483630","20486710"," If you've ever had palely toasted barrel bourbon, probably one of the best I've had."
"20486890","20488370"," You know, Paul, write that down right now. "
"20489090","20490210"," I have not had it."
"20490630","20491170"," I've had it."
"20491310","20491950"," I don't even have it. "
"20491950","20492190"," Oh, yeah."
"20492250","20492910"," I drink angels envy."
"20493830","20496770"," I've drank every single grip and winkle. "
"20497090","20498530"," I've, I've drank a lot of bourbon."
"20499850","20500430"," Oh, yeah."
"20500610","20501330"," Rum cake is good. "
"20502150","20502730"," Uh, hold on."
"20502870","20503970"," Penelope, never had it."
"20506870","20508430"," Uh, toasted barrel bourbon. "
"20511130","20512230"," I will check that one out."
"20513790","20516730"," Matter of fact, I'll, uh, I'll buy a bottle of that."
"20516810","20518630"," If I can get a bottle of that, I'll buy it, uh, tonight. "
"20518910","20521110"," We'll have a toast on Friday with it."
"20521150","20521350"," Okay."
"20525880","20527720"," Hey, I drink angels envy every once in a while. "
"20527780","20529500"," There's a wheat bourbon that I've been drinking here and there."
"20529620","20530040"," That's pretty good."
"20530160","20530800"," I forget the name of it. "
"20533900","20536940"," But you don't think you want to hear it, but you want to know a cheap, so I used to"
"20536940","20538940"," live in Charleston, South Carolina."
"20538940","20543460"," I did some, um, some contract work down there."
"20545460","20548680"," And I met the guys from, uh, Evan Williams. "
"20549740","20552440"," It's dirt cheap bourbon, uh, dirt, dirt cheap."
"20553180","20554460"," But they've been making it the same way."
"20554780","20558380"," He used to win a ton of awards back in like the early 1900s, early 1800s. "
"20558740","20563240"," And those old school cheap bourbons that stayed the same over the years have come into fashion down"
"20563240","20564020"," south to an extent."
"20564020","20571800"," And I went to the distillery and Evan Williams shocked at how delicious it was."
"20571980","20574600"," It was like 10 or 20 bucks a bottle or something. "
"20575520","20580900"," My everyday bourbon is right now and it's been for a while as, um, high west."
"20581760","20583240"," I've been enjoying high west."
"20586810","20591230"," Yeah, I never get hangovers with, with bourbon, but anything like sugar based. "
"20592450","20595030"," I get a, I get, I get, I get hung over."
"20595670","20597150"," I don't know why, a bourbon I'm fine with."
"20597270","20598070"," I have a couple glasses of bourbon. "
"20598210","20598610"," I'm good to go."
"20601230","20603850"," If you want to get, you want to wrestle it and end up getting drug burns."
"20605530","20609070"," I don't smoke weed or take, uh, I don't take any kind of CBD products. "
"20609070","20609630"," Something like that."
"20609690","20610290"," I don't do any drugs."
"20612350","20614750"," Um, but I like to have a couple glasses of bourbon now. "
"20615270","20616930"," I've changed my tastes over the years."
"20617410","20619170"," Different things as I've gotten younger and older."
"20619330","20619890"," I used to love beer. "
"20620570","20622490"," I don't like, I don't drink beer like I used to."
"20623750","20625570"," I think just, I drink a lot of wine."
"20625570","20632010"," I went down like the wine hole, like, uh, started drinking a bunch of German wines and, uh, Spanish"
"20632010","20640750"," wines and, uh, yeah, some, some Italian wines, uh, but Spanish and Austrian whites and stuff like"
"20640750","20640990"," that. "
"20641390","20644130"," Anything that wasn't French, uh, French is boring."
"20644550","20649150"," French is about as boring to me as a US wine, but real hard to find stuff."
"20650810","20654610"," Um, so I've gone down like different rabbit holes over the years. "
"20654610","20657550"," Right now it's, I'm just drinking bourbon, a couple shots of bourbon."
"20658190","20661810"," Uh, I'll drink some, uh, white lightning if I go backpacking or something like that."
"20661910","20664350"," But other than that, not too much. "
"20664650","20665050"," I'll be right back."
"20665190","20665850"," Give me five minutes, right?"
"20666050","20666550"," Take a break."
"20668710","20669070"," Yeah. "
"20669250","20670570"," So Evan Williams is big down there."
"20670770","20670870"," Yeah."
"20671430","20672490"," It's an easy go to. "
"20672610","20674510"," If you poured a glass of, uh, you know what?"
"20674530","20675290"," It's another good one too."
"20675870","20683310"," Is there are some Japanese bourbon knockoffs that are like 15 bucks a bottle that if you were to"
"20683310","20689910"," pour it, the matter of fact, they intentionally make them to mimic, uh, rip and winkle, uh, uh, uh,"
"20690190","20690790"," old Pappy, right?"
"20691270","20692410"," Like Pappy nine year."
"20692710","20699030"," You can get the Japanese whiskey, uh, knockoffs that are, if I was a poor glass of both for you,"
"20699170","20700370"," you'd never know the difference. "
"20701090","20703710"," If I told you if it was rip and winkly, you'd say it was."
"20704410","20706810"," So, and I'm not, I'm not talking about the Scotch whiskeys."
"20706950","20709270"," I'm talking about look, look for, you have to get on the internet and look for them. "
"20709270","20712250"," Uh, but I used to drink a lot of knockoff, uh, rip and winkles."
"20712710","20719570"," Japan is like famous for, for copying U.S. Bourbons for dirt cheap, you know, on $1,000 bottle of"
"20719570","20723170"," wine or $1,000 bottle of, uh, bourbon by $15."
"20724250","20728190"," Um, people claim that they can tell the difference, but I don't think I can't. "
"20729070","20730570"," And I'll be on another honest with you."
"20730870","20735130"," Anything over like the nine year, like the 12 year, anything higher than that."
"20735330","20736710"," I think they have a 14 to 16. "
"20737190","20737930"," No, they got a 12."
"20738570","20744190"," I think they got a 12 of 14 and 18 on rip and winkle and, uh, they all taste like"
"20744190","20744450"," Scotch."
"20745610","20748070"," All of them outside of the nine year. "
"20748330","20749150"," It ain't bourbon."
"20749650","20756650"," The one cool part about the nine year, uh, rip is that you literally can taste the Kentucky woods."
"20757150","20758210"," Like you can taste. "
"20758450","20760970"," It's like you're in Kentucky when you're drinking it."
"20761030","20763670"," So anyone that tells you it's overrated, they're fucking lying."
"20763990","20764870"," That shit is bomb. "
"20764870","20765050"," Bomb."
"20766270","20766630"," Bomb."
"20767430","20769890"," Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. "
"20770170","20772910"," Best bourbon I've ever had in my entire life, hands down."
"20776550","20777630"," I like Brunello."
"20778390","20779870"," I can, I can get down on some Brunello. "
"20790830","20791190"," Nice."
"20791730","20791890"," Nice."
"20792170","20792250"," Nice. "
"20793170","20793950"," That's rad, Chase."
"20795010","20795470"," All right."
"20795510","20795970"," I'll be right back. "
"20796730","20798390"," I'll give you a Friday and a Friday and a five minute break."
"20798390","20803490"," Uh, one last thing to note on the spy right here is, uh, there is some weakness coming in."
"20804770","20806350"," Uh, you know, I'm looking for that. "
"20806510","20807510"," There's a one, two, three."
"20808050","20809690"," I don't like this fourth dip down here."
"20810650","20812530"," I don't like seeing this weakness right here. "
"20813350","20815530"," You know, sometimes you see that weakness pop in."
"20816670","20818410"," I don't like seeing that right there."
"20819350","20821250"," You usually get this roll over in here. "
"20821410","20821870"," I don't like that."
"20822690","20824470"," Calls come in at an IWM and video."
"20825130","20825650"," Mm. "
"20828450","20833490"," Market makers are just, are just sucking the options dry right now."
"20838250","20840310"," Make it a little roll in the market right here."
"21329290","21331010"," More than 20 minutes now. "
"21331130","21333170"," See the close of pitch rating in US bomb markets."
"21333210","21340810"," The US two, you're yielded 2.12%. The 10 year 2.34% both off of earlier session highs and"
"21340810","21448690"," the 30 year dropping back to 2.5%. White"
"21448690","21448810"," House."
"21449110","21450190"," Economic advisor. "
"21450450","21453710"," D saying we should see more US production of oil."
"21506640","21511900"," These goes on to say that the administration is looking for potential relief opportunities to"
"21511900","21512740"," consumers."
"21515020","21581840"," Uh, too"
"21581840","21582380"," funny, right?"
"21582600","21583000"," You got a."
"21584180","21587100"," I was talking about us earlier hoping for more of a dip. "
"21587100","21590260"," And now it's finally selling off down here."
"21590400","21591860"," Just keep your eyes on USO."
"21592180","21594580"," Looks like you might, I wasn't listening in. "
"21595000","21596860"," Says White House economic advisor."
"21597080","21602260"," D should see more oil production from US looking to provide relief to customers."
"21602840","21607320"," So if you are looking for a buy in on USO, keep it on your radar here. "
"21707800","21710960"," One other trade that I noticed this morning."
"21711730","21717080"," I did notice this morning until just now I've got it up on discord right now."
"21717700","21720780"," And that is going to be a work day. "
"21722240","21725920"," Had June 17th 200 C come in."
"21727560","21732100"," If you're looking at starting work day, it hasn't shown too much of a reaction yet today."
"21734420","21735660"," We'll look at it on the. "
"21736380","21737440"," On the one day."
"21738580","21740340"," This is at 11 o'clock this morning."
"21740540","21742800"," It came in at what time 11 23. "
"21743400","21744780"," It's been a steady climb."
"21745020","21745780"," It was down at 235."
"21746520","21747580"," It has been climbing ever since. "
"21751150","21755330"," But on a longer time frame, there's a lot of buyers and support down here."
"21755450","21757230"," This looks like a bunch of other tickets we've looked at right."
"21758130","21760970"," They're having that consolidation phase for the next move up. "
"21762090","21765890"," So that's a pretty big buy on work day."
"21765890","21768830"," June 17th 200 C."
"21769510","21772610"," 10,000 contracts bought on work day."
"21772890","21773130"," W."
"21773150","21773310"," D."
"21773510","21773570"," A."
"21773750","21773990"," Y."
"21774750","21776410"," Just keep your eyes on work day. "
"21777190","21782210"," And the other interesting note at this time of the day is going to be IWM."
"21783610","21792970"," So IWM has a lot of contract buying for May and for March 25th and March 31st."
"21793690","21801890"," And the IWM chart actually looks better to an extent than even the spy chart. "
"21803510","21807110"," And it's one bounce down here, another bounce and the third bounce here."
"21807910","21811430"," And they're on this role over here."
"21812590","21815110"," And buyers stepping in on the day here as well. "
"21816750","21818830"," The buyers are pushing up here."
"21819030","21822690"," I kind of like the squeeze play on IWM here."
"21823930","21825710"," So just keep your eyes on IWM. "
"21827370","21829810"," I know the market looks like it's going to roll over here."
"21831370","21839390"," If the buyers can't keep control here, if there's a capitulation dip of any kind here on IWM, it"
"21839390","21842370"," might be a good dip buy, like spy had a good dip buy yesterday."
"21842370","21850550"," So just keep your eyes on IWM watching this nice one and two. "
"21851550","21851830"," Right."
"21852170","21857030"," So I'm not saying we're going to get this here, but I do like the trade in IWM."
"21858250","21864310"," There's a lot of momentum in the swing down for move higher on IWM. "
"21866580","21868580"," I like this consolidation here."
"21873250","21874950"," I like all this right here."
"21875090","21876570"," One, two, three. "
"21876570","21881930"," I guess if you're bearish, you'd say don't buy it until it comes back down here again."
"21882770","21891990"," But with this break off this channel here, I do like the idea of IWM squeezing at some point in"
"21891990","21892250"," here."
"21893110","21895670"," A lot of accumulation in IWM. "
"21897630","21900150"," I know this might not be the best time to buying IWM."
"21900610","21905090"," If there's a quick capitulation move in IWM though, I still like the idea."
"21905090","21910110"," Even if it comes down one more time, or if it's down in here somewhere off the 200, if you"
"21910110","21917150"," get that test down here and the 200 or so, it could be a nice long play for IWM. "
"21917670","21920810"," I like the idea that people keep buying and buying and buying and buying it here."
"21921410","21923230"," At some point you should see a rip higher."
"21924750","21929590"," I'd expect 220 or near 220 for a trade on IWM. "
"21929590","21934970"," One thing about IWM either remember is that it's not normally an intraday trade."
"21934970","21940150"," You got to hold the trade for like a week to three weeks to get it to print nice and"
"21940150","21940370"," fat."
"21940570","21941150"," It's a slow trade. "
"21941350","21942870"," You buy it and don't look at it for a few weeks."
"21945110","21946390"," Just keep an eye on IWM."
"21993120","21997460"," It still has a lot of sellers on it right now. "
"21998970","22001570"," I'll tell you what if there's a squeeze higher it's going to move."
"22004790","22006510"," It'll be relentless on its way up."
"22013170","22014370"," 214, 218. "
"22018630","22020650"," Just keep your eyes on IWM."
"22028580","22029500"," Consolidating here."
"22030820","22032960"," More buyers and sellers on options. "
"22038610","22040690"," Got a lot of buyers in here."
"22124700","22134360"," Also note I was talking about buying a dip on a USO and also I noticed that hadn't rolled"
"22134360","22136780"," over enough yet, but then it did start to roll over."
"22136900","22143140"," But now we're watching some pretty major puts against energy and oil. "
"22143140","22148120"," XLE, April 1st, $74p for $1 million."
"22148980","22155140"," XOP, April 1st, $136p for $759,000."
"22155880","22160700"," Maybe just that news is what's going to be a profit-taking operation. "
"22161600","22162860"," So I think I'm wrong on that call."
"22163680","22173170"," We're watching some pretty heavy trades against energy right now."
"22173170","22174970"," It has started to fall off. "
"22176150","22178770"," It's now down to $76 on XLE."
"22179290","22181230"," So be careful of this trade."
"22181610","22182910"," There's a lot of money here. "
"22183150","22184710"," It hasn't come down that far yet."
"22184790","22188890"," So if you look at energy, this has not come down."
"22189050","22196330"," They're calling for price target of $74p on XLE way down here. "
"22196850","22199090"," So make this a trade alert for you."
"22199170","22200950"," I'm going to post this on Twitter."
"22202390","22205650"," But there's some heavy, heavy put action on energy. "
"22372850","22375290"," Otis, that scan is badass, dude."
"22375990","22376690"," You know what we'll do?"
"22376810","22377750"," Let's talk about it this weekend."
"22378030","22379090"," I run at least once a week. "
"22379250","22379850"," I try to run it."
"22380550","22382910"," So normally Mondays are dump days for stocks."
"22383630","22386310"," So I'll tend to want to check it on Mondays and Fridays. "
"22387730","22391370"," It's a badass scanning tool."
"22393840","22394960"," Good question, though."
"22402170","22403610"," Five minutes to the top there. "
"22403770","22407770"," We'll get the official Bank of Mexico rate decision."
"22408170","22412490"," Again, earlier, the Mexican president of Lopez Overdoar tipped off."
"22413650","22418970"," But the central bank will be raising by 50 basis points as expected to six and a half percent. "
"22448400","22454320"," We're seeing some strength in the marijuana related names following a report that a house panel"
"22454320","22458780"," will be considering a bill to decriminalize marijuana next week."
"22472250","22477370"," Then we have seen multiple pushes in the U.S. House of Representatives to decriminalize marijuana."
"22477730","22484270"," But ultimately, it always seems to be that a little very little chance of passing the Senate. "
"22485010","22491590"," But nevertheless, we are seeing volatility in the marijuana names once again on these reports of"
"22491590","22495530"," potential bill circulating its way through the House of Representatives."
"22692670","22697110"," Mexico's central bank confirming with their announcement of the raising of the overnight lending"
"22697110","22702510"," rate to six and a half percent from six percent as essentially announced by the president earlier"
"22702510","22702990"," today."
"22754020","22755360"," All right, I'm back here. "
"22757040","22757940"," Just a second."
"22758060","22761380"," I got to make sure that I don't need this stuff over here so you all can hear me out"
"22761380","22761560"," there."
"22761560","22762260"," Okay, we're back. "
"22763680","22765960"," All right, it's 301 power time."
"22768060","22769240"," And you're second here to."
"22770500","22772140"," All right, let's look at this here. "
"22772440","22774260"," Let's look at a chart here real quick."

"25893230","25902890"," that'll pin to 451 minimum then also there's the other school of thought that so people"
"25902890","25908770"," pin to month no no no no less than 451 and then but there's two other schools of thought 435"
"25908770","25915430"," would be the third bad month in a row the third red month and then I think for the quarter"
"25915430","25924170"," it's like 453 or something now for the entire quarter so both of those numbers are I should be"
"25924170","25930750"," targets like or though not both but we shouldn't be lower than 435 we shouldn't be lower than 451"
"25930750","25940670"," or 453 unless it takes until the 31st or the 1st to get there sometimes they'll have to put the"
"25940670","25946130"," bad quarter in but then be like oh yeah but we raised it up on on a on April 1"
"25946130","25953890"," though don't worry about it but the thought process in this is that they don't want they don't want"
"25953890","25958270"," the bad quarter because the bad court we know about the bad quarter what the bad quarter does roll"
"25958270","25969290"," over on our one we hit 45 0 10 so the"
"25969290","25977610"," so the thought process is after or by the 31st or even the 1st that we should trade higher than"
"25977610","25986510"," 453 at a minimum you would you would think they wouldn't trade lower than four fifth or 435 and"
"25986510","25993370"," then the the the other next thing would be you have worse things on your table we write if we"
"25993370","26000530"," trade below those numbers we trade below 435 I'll buy the 31st or 1st then you have bigger fish to"
"26000530","26006470"," fry you you're gonna get super bearish at that point we go back to the root regime of selling every"
"26006470","26014930"," rip literally every single rip you you you you transition with it yeah we transitioned on an early"
"26014930","26021390"," January to sell every rip no matter what rip it was we sold it you try retransition back into that"
"26021390","26029090"," same regime and your price target at that point is somewhere down around 360 so you don't have to"
"26029090","26035990"," actually catch you don't have to catch from here to 435 just know that if it's below there we even"
"26035990","26045290"," below 453 on the 31st of the 1st that it opens the door to giant losses in the next quarter"
"26045290","26054050"," the the range would then become you know down to 390 3 73 83 60 down there so you know"
"26054050","26060710"," the catch the whole entire move if you're a bear if you think the world's burning you want to see"
"26060710","26067030"," the door open for that you don't need to be short from from fucking 450 down to 435 that's chump"
"26067030","26073070"," change that's chump change so you just waiting for that to happen if you're a bear otherwise"
"26073070","26078470"," they're gonna try to save the day they're gonna try to put window dressing on for them to put"
"26078470","26083150"," window window dressing on heading into the in the month it's 453 or higher matter of fact they"
"26083150","26089690"," probably need to go to 460 just so it doesn't go any lower than 443 for in a month now"
"26089690","26095750"," if we break 43 435 is the bad one 435 is the one that's like that's the one where you're"
"26095750","26107660"," seeing super lows and for the next quarter you're gonna see death and destruction so even"
"26107660","26115640"," if we go that low in the future you're still looking at at institutions that are gonna try to save"
"26115640","26118940"," the quarter that's what you're gonna try to do they can try to or let's what it looks like they're"
"26118940","26125300"," doing right or at this point today that's what it looks like they're doing trying to save the"
"26125300","26132900"," quarter in my view that's they're doing you can see it right here right now so we talked about this"
"26132900","26139400"," earlier so the key here is going to be what the bears are loaded to the tips and puts here"
"26139400","26146100"," well actually they sold them all for a huge loss they were they were loaded the fuck up on puts"
"26146100","26153520"," then they switched them by calls finally now 450 is up to a dollar 76 and holding and the point"
"26153520","26157860"," would be that they have to make their money back so they just a few minutes to go to close"
"26157860","26162180"," we are hearing the market on clothes now north of two billion to the buy side of stocks have pushed"
"26162180","26166740"," out to new session highs here in the last 10 minutes so the key is what are they gonna do"
"26166740","26172700"," in the overnight if it was me and my guess is they're going to attempt to push it above you"
"26172700","26178460"," know 450 and try to put us into a trading range of 450 to 460 here that doesn't mean we"
"26178460","26184800"," don't trade back below 450 but this is our second attempt now at this is our second attempt at"
"26184800","26191420"," trading into a new range right here we go right here 450 57 we're now making our second attempt"
"26191420","26197580"," here one tap and two taps so the key is that my assumption is that they're gonna place it up"
"26197580","26202920"," here and see if cash market can pick up the torch here if cash market can't pick up the torch"
"26203460","26209320"," you'll see you'll see a sell-off you only had two chances sometimes you get three but mostly you"
"26209320","26214720"," get two so I'm gonna expect this second chance to get us up and over the hump it's very common"
"26214720","26224600"," to see to see the up and downside to see a push in futures marketing globex if the cash market"
"26224600","26229080"," can't get it done this works both ways for bulls and bears so I'm going to expect to see that"
