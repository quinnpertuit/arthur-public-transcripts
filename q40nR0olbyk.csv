"79290","81250"," Check 1, 2."
"83350","86010"," What the fuck is going on out there?"
"86170","87390"," It just got demonetized."
"88950","108800"," I guess"
"108800","109560"," I'm swearing."
"113070","115130"," How are you all doing out there?"
"117350","121470"," Oh baby, what's going on?"
"121670","122910"," Where's that fair value?"
"123770","125670"," That new contract is out. "
"125670","130930"," Oh, that new futures contract."
"131730","133810"," Fair value, baby."
"135390","138610"," Got the MOC southside over a billion. "
"139170","141250"," Working for the polls yesterday."
"142210","145090"," Huge shout out to trainer podcast on that one."
"145850","147550"," Hell yeah. "
"147550","157280"," Oh boy."
"157380","157640"," Oh boy."
"157700","158700"," Hold on a second air. "
"158900","159020"," Bam."
"159680","160200"," Okay."
"160480","161460"," What are we doing up here?"
"162800","165380"," Got a 30 minute charts up here, right?"
"165720","168500"," I'm going to show you a couple things that I want you to see. "
"168500","171420"," You've got this little bit of all right in here."
"173200","174800"," Breaking past it right now."
"175040","176460"," Nearly that near perfect bounce. "
"177620","181440"," Got this prior high back here as well to be looking at."
"181620","183040"," See that prior high right over here."
"183040","184680"," You got a little one right here, a little bit of all. "
"184700","186760"," A little bit of all up here too."
"187880","189660"," Put it back on the one minute here."
"189820","189900"," See. "
"190220","193920"," Oh, look at that one minute chart right here."
"194160","196220"," Look at how sexy that thing is."
"197300","199560"," You got another little bar up here. "
"199880","201300"," I didn't post this on Twitter."
"201300","205180"," I should have put this last little one right there."
"205540","207120"," You might get a pullback right about now. "
"209540","212940"," Right about now you should see a slight pullback here."
"213980","216220"," And then you've got one more target to the upside."
"218440","220120"," So let's take a look at that real quick. "
"220340","224140"," Put that right there for you just so you can see it right there."
"224880","225480"," Does that help?"
"227380","229580"," Give me just one quick second here."
"229580","231760"," Good morning to all of you out there. "
"233400","234460"," I'll be honest."
"235380","236880"," I got to be fucking honest."
"237140","237540"," So yesterday. "
"238700","241400"," I was buying that clothes pretty heavily."
"241600","243940"," As a matter of fact, I was buying the fucking bottom two."
"244020","248340"," I was like bam, bam, bam, just adding and adding and adding and adding. "
"248900","251560"," And I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you."
"252400","253740"," One hundred fucking percent."
"254680","255740"," I was scared. "
"257019","257579"," Shitless."
"258740","265780"," All night long because there was one like it was too easy to just do that."
"266000","268120"," I mean, brain, I couldn't figure it out. "
"268280","270780"," I was like, I said something to you guys yesterday."
"270780","278420"," I said, it's probably better for you to not trade puts into the clothes yesterday."
"278420","283600"," I was like, yeah, we can see that more that like last dip down and then we'll come back up"
"283600","284340"," before the open. "
"285360","287520"," But even so, I was even scared."
"287640","292420"," I was more scared that they would dump us down into that forty or forty five fifteen."
"293320","298820"," And then the then that that rip would start this morning that that manipulation downside move like"
"298820","303980"," you put the paint on the bulls and then you hit them one more time before you run it up"
"303980","304840"," today. "
"305080","305660"," Let's say, right?"
"305940","306060"," So."
"307500","309580"," I'm for just that reason alone."
"310080","315540"," I'm not going to tell you that I took that trade into the closed yesterday and I felt the highest"
"315540","316800"," confidence in it. "
"317340","325060"," The safer trade into that close in hindsight was waiting to this morning, even if I missed the"
"325060","325360"," trade."
"325800","330560"," So I want to be cautioning you on that that yesterday as I was doing that, I was like, yeah,"
"330660","331140"," we could easily."
"331820","334940"," Slam this down, hit the forty five fifteen. "
"335740","341000"," Anyone trying to buy that clothes, paying trades on, even if it bounces this morning."
"341640","346860"," You'd see you'd be ripping up all your one dates for today and then they would start that run"
"346860","347740"," higher today."
"348320","349000"," They didn't. "
"349360","351520"," So I guess I won that one."
"351640","355580"," But, dude, I'll tell you what, I was not feeling it last night."
"355720","361120"," I was pretty fucking nauseous about it. "
"361120","363360"," It was the best trade to take into the close."
"364960","366040"," Statistically, it wasn't."
"366120","370920"," I mean, there were reasons for why we went out to try to podcast explain some of that to me"
"370920","378080"," last night, but still, still, very commonly, you get that last little fucking dip down and then you"
"378080","378540"," get the rip. "
"379860","384380"," So at any rate, we're coming up into some resistance right now."
"384540","387440"," We've got a couple targets to the upside."
"387440","396400"," And furthermore, with that same idea in mind, I got asked this morning, do you expect any"
"396400","398480"," significant downside move?"
"399540","408720"," And I didn't want to explain it on Twitter because I didn't want to explain it on Twitter because"
"408720","409720"," price matters. "
"411760","417420"," And how you like what feel like what's price matters if we get a role next week?"
"417980","420160"," Where are we getting that that role from?"
"420680","420820"," Right."
"421420","426460"," So if we can't crash this mark right now, we got a pin above at 4,600, right?"
"426620","428380"," A magnet above 4,600."
"428380","429900"," So we can't crash the market. "
"430300","434800"," We're building a base here for the market and the get in the gamma world."
"435540","440380"," So if they are going to, you know, if they are going to roll it down next week, where is"
"440380","440880"," it from?"
"441420","445000"," You know, are they rolling it down from the bottom yesterday?"
"445660","448580"," Or are they rolling it down from up on high?"
"449260","450880"," So that will matter."
"451160","459300"," So my, my posit here is the banks are fucking long into Friday and they're going to get their money"
"459300","460000"," to the upside. "
"461040","468680"," You should be looking for one of those highs into the close this week for a gentle pullback into"
"468680","469360"," next week."
"469500","470340"," Does that make sense?"
"470660","476220"," A lot of like some people out there expecting like step down from the lows that we had, let's say"
"476220","477120"," at the close yesterday."
"478460","486320"," I would be look, I would be more looking for a high into today, right, possibly even tomorrow to"
"486320","490420"," throw something on some kind of sprinkle on into the 15th. "
"491000","493040"," And I haven't talked about this."
"493360","497860"," I think I might have mentioned it yesterday, but there's something else I want to talk to you"
"497860","500120"," about, which would be."
"501760","507640"," There might be, I mean, we're going to talk about Jerome for next week because, you know, we know,"
"507920","517740"," the dates might not be exact, but it would be hilarious if you get no rate increase, right?"
"518260","523260"," And you get the whiplash action in the in the rate decision and then a pin. "
"525040","531840"," And they just torch you even if it's going up, just torch you for an extra day or so."
"532140","540060"," The move comes after like a day or two later, not guaranteed dealers can chase if too many people"
"540060","542140"," buy calls and buy the market with real money."
"542420","547960"," Yeah, it can go up in the dealers will chase that move all the way up, but I'm betting right"
"547960","551400"," now that they are already have a plan in place. "
"552220","560520"," To crush your dreams on rate decision day, you know, we're we're pricing in no rate increase."
"560900","562940"," So just be just be careful."
"563320","564800"," We'll talk about it today. "
"564960","569500"," Be careful as we head into that Wednesday of that."
"569500","570860"," Yeah, it's something we're not going there."
"570940","572860"," It's that you might get crushed on the way there. "
"572860","574900"," You might not be positioned properly."
"576120","582100"," They can slim it down before the rate decision and make you rebuy all that shit again, right?"
"582400","589220"," So we're going to play this one really, really close to the chest heading into Wednesday."
"589960","591780"," Good morning, by the way, to all of you out there. "
"591900","592640"," Give me one quick second."
"592840","593220"," I got to do."
"593560","595580"," I got some work to do here in the background. "
"596780","598060"," I love all of you."
"598120","598920"," I hope you're all doing well."
"609810","611310"," Fucking great morning, by the way. "
"611310","613170"," Dude, I'm fucking making so much money."
"613170","614110"," It's not even fucking funny."
"614290","614310"," Like. "
"616690","623190"," I was in my office this morning screaming and my whole family could hear me and they were like,"
"623310","625410"," what the fuck is wrong with him."
"630870","633370"," They could hear me across my home like."
"643420","650100"," If I win big, dude, like, you know, I don't"
"650100","657580"," know. "
"658160","662500"," Past like past like few weeks or so, like."
"663420","665060"," It's been pretty standard, right?"
"665340","669960"," Like sell for a great money, buy for great money, sell for great money, buy for great money, sell"
"669960","671700"," for great money, buy for great money."
"672200","673620"," It's been pretty fucking epic. "
"673940","678900"," So any of you that know me have known that for a couple weeks, I told you got, I think"
"678900","682280"," it's what 14 sessions ago or something like that."
"682280","683400"," I warned all of you."
"683480","686440"," I've warned all of you and into it, right?"
"686600","687940"," We're going to ping pong, right?"
"688200","689400"," Ping pong, ping pong. "
"689780","695480"," And you're going to see bulls get pissed at those tops and bears get pissed at those bottoms and"
"695480","698260"," they're going to they're going to scream the whole way as we do it."
"698260","699040"," And we did it."
"699240","700440"," We fucking did it. "
"703860","705420"," I fucking love it."
"710640","711400"," That's what I did."
"711500","715460"," I said something like that, bear town share, almost those exact words. "
"721040","721840"," Oh boy."
"721960","722360"," Oh boy."
"722400","722820"," Look at that. "
"722960","723020"," Okay."
"723100","724540"," I got to do some levels really quick."
"724780","725640"," Oh, I didn't post anything. "
"726000","726740"," Did I hold on here?"
"726980","727060"," Shoot."
"728860","729520"," Hold on."
"729680","730920"," And we do the live stream stuff. "
"732480","733620"," Think tight here."
"736820","737340"," Okay."
"738620","740840"," So I got something to tell you guys. "
"740840","741320"," All right."
"742040","744780"," I don't know what you guys."
"745040","746040"," I want to tell you guys something. "
"746300","746500"," Okay."
"747980","751340"," I got gather around gather around the fireplace over here."
"751940","753320"," We got something to talk about. "
"753320","753580"," Okay."
"755900","759320"," Now I want you to do me a solid too, if you can."
"762560","763560"," Hold on a second here. "
"771460","772380"," All right."
"773400","774620"," Take one second."
"776780","777240"," Okay. "
"777480","778980"," So that stream link is out there."
"779360","780520"," This is what I want to tell you guys."
"780740","780820"," Okay. "
"782480","790120"," I can't tell you a lot, but I'm going to I'm going to leak something small."
"790380","793240"," It's not quite an arg, but remember we talked about an arg."
"793360","793600"," Okay. "
"795660","797940"," We are launching."
"798320","798540"," Okay."
"798960","800240"," We are launching this week. "
"800540","800880"," Okay."
"801680","808280"," You are going to see some teasers come out."
"809620","812260"," Over today and tomorrow. "
"813960","815200"," Into Friday."
"815200","815760"," Okay."
"816000","816440"," What day is today?"
"816580","817860"," I don't even know what day today is. "
"820620","824380"," You're going to see stuff on social media."
"825320","828740"," And it's going to be throwing out some."
"829740","830780"," Some deals. "
"831440","834980"," So if you know, I want to talk to you guys with two things."
"834980","836520"," Let's let's get something out of the way here."
"836660","840120"," So remember something here gang. "
"840360","844880"," Do not remember do not ever do not ever forget your rules, right?"
"845080","845720"," We'll be back."
"845720","847640"," Check the one minute, right?"
"848100","849940"," Watch the line is still quite vertical."
"850340","853280"," If it begins to flatten, we'll check the five minute, right?"
"854240","856480"," Stay soberish here in your trading. "
"856700","858420"," Remember yesterday in that close, right?"
"859500","861560"," People were buried the fuck up, right?"
"861980","866940"," And I was trying to be as calm and rational in my trading as I possibly could."
"867500","870140"," Even in the face of all that fucking doom on that close."
"870460","874200"," So I want you as a trader right now to just remember your tools, remember your training that we"
"874200","874720"," give you here. "
"875420","878840"," And you trade this up as we do, right?"
"879700","882940"," Back checks, five, one minute back checks, five minute back checks."
"882940","886100"," We know where resistance is on the upside."
"886320","888380"," We know where where last support is, right?"
"888600","889540"," So just be careful of that. "
"891120","891580"," Now."
"892800","894540"," Back to what we're talking about there."
"894660","894780"," Okay. "
"897180","899160"," What do I want to say a few things here?"
"899340","901320"," I want you guys to know that."
"902040","903560"," What we started here."
"904480","908760"," What we started here was for retailers, the entire thesis. "
"909640","917280"," I began because I was on social media and I was tired of seeing my friends."
"917580","919640"," I don't care if there are bulls, bears, theta."
"919780","920180"," I don't care. "
"920280","927380"," My actual friends on social media getting fucking torched like blown up."
"928160","929320"," Just like gone."
"929680","930080"," Money gone. "
"930580","930980"," Money gone."
"932020","935180"," And drinking schkule, bull Kool-Aid, bear Kool-Aid."
"935180","936040"," I don't care whatever. "
"936580","945780"," And the one thing that bothered me that I felt was that if most people had just some fucking dumb"
"945780","953320"," down simple tools, they would dumb down simple tools in their toolbox that they could become a"
"953320","954640"," somewhat better trader."
"955600","957520"," And I didn't know nothing about streaming."
"957760","959700"," I had no vision, no nothing. "
"959700","963100"," The only thing that I had was I'm going to stream for my friends."
"963680","969520"," And so we started this thing with 100 people, 200 people, I think something like that."
"969760","973560"," And those all those people are still here today. "
"974280","974640"," Majority."
"976180","978160"," I'd say like 80, 90%."
"978840","985580"," Still hanging around here or on Twitter or even old friends from Wall Street Bets from back in the"
"985580","985800"," day. "
"987920","990120"," And this has been hard work."
"991000","992240"," It has not been easy."
"992620","994840"," It's been a labor of love. "
"995180","996260"," It's costing me a lot of money."
"996500","997340"," Cost me a lot of time."
"998440","1001380"," You guys have seen me get torched in the stream, right?"
"1001540","1003200"," You guys have seen me lose a lot of money in the stream. "
"1003220","1005540"," You guys have seen me have heartache in the stream."
"1007320","1008180"," It's been brutal."
"1008360","1013200"," And there's been a lot of people come along with us along the way that have had that same"
"1013200","1014020"," experience. "
"1015240","1021100"," Admins, moderators, developers, supporters, people support me on."
"1021560","1025000"," You'll see people come after me online and people defend me, right?"
"1025300","1027440"," They don't want to have to defend me online and that they do."
"1027660","1032560"," So I didn't think it would grow or become what it is today. "
"1033520","1035740"," And so for that, I'm very grateful to you."
"1035920","1040740"," And I always made you a promise that what we do here will always be free."
"1040740","1043000"," And it will always be free. "
"1043160","1044020"," I promise you that."
"1044460","1053500"," Now, there is a group of people here that want this to stay what we're doing, right?"
"1053640","1054520"," They want this to continue."
"1055040","1056000"," They want it to grow. "
"1056460","1059000"," They want it to grow into something more than what it is."
"1059320","1064920"," They're willing to support what we're doing if we offer more."
"1064920","1068900"," So as you know me, that will never change. "
"1069340","1074360"," Our relationship, that agreement that we made will always be there forever and ever."
"1074700","1077360"," And I will never be a part of this if that ever goes away."
"1078220","1081720"," But there are people that want more and there are people that are willing to pay for that. "
"1081980","1088560"," They literally contact me and say, do website, do tools, do this, do that so I can get my own"
"1088560","1090020"," access to it and I'll pay for it."
"1090340","1092680"," So I just want you to know that as we move forward."
"1093620","1097980"," Because I was in a meeting last night and I was like, you know, I was like, there's going to"
"1097980","1098700"," be some blowback. "
"1098860","1100000"," There's always voices out there."
"1100040","1101520"," It's like that guy's a fucking sellout."
"1101700","1104340"," That guy's trying to make money, all this other stuff. "
"1104620","1109200"," I want you to be aware that in the background, the guys that I work with to make this final"
"1109200","1111120"," product that you see out there every day."
"1111700","1112900"," That is not our intent."
"1113260","1114940"," None of our meetings are based around that. "
"1115360","1119420"," Our meetings are based around making this last right."
"1119880","1124960"," Making sure that we can bring other people in to make this last to always be there for you guys."
"1125860","1129020"," And to do more development to offer you even more. "
"1129760","1133100"," And so there are people supporters out there that want to see that happen."
"1133380","1137020"," We're going to launch that next phase of what we're doing here."
"1137940","1141100"," And so because I've known you guys the longest, right?"
"1141340","1144660"," You and the guys in the discord and all that, the guys on Twitter and stuff like that. "
"1144660","1150600"," I want you to know that you're going to start to see some some like like the arg type thing"
"1150600","1152400"," come out the next day or two, right?"
"1153160","1156400"," For some discounts and deals and all that kind of stuff."
"1156900","1160500"," For a launch that's sooner than you think."
"1161420","1166900"," We're talking like real soon, like I'm not going to tell you anything else other than that. "
"1167000","1171660"," So what I'd say to you is if you know people that I know, my friends, right?"
"1171660","1178300"," You might see them posting stuff with breadcrumbs as to where to look and where to go and what to"
"1178300","1179840"," do and all the stuff before it happens."
"1180380","1181960"," You'll see guys like Joe Donut."
"1182080","1187740"," You'll see guys like Ray Volley or John L or David AMS or Binky Chas. "
"1187920","1190420"," All these guys that you guys know who I know out there, right?"
"1190540","1192080"," You guys know my boys are my friends."
"1193100","1195660"," If you start to see any of that stuff, just read on it."
"1196200","1199960"," And when it pops, we're going to do it together as a group. "
"1199960","1200340"," Okay."
"1201860","1203540"," So I'm looking forward to this."
"1204040","1209320"," If you've been here since day one, please, like this next few days, time to have some fun for a"
"1209320","1209740"," few days. "
"1210340","1212140"," Smile, enjoy, look back and be grateful."
"1213060","1214700"," And we got some from this launch."
"1214920","1220020"," We have a bunch of other tools that are coming out as well, dropping in upcoming weeks and months"
"1220020","1220920"," and stuff like that. "
"1221160","1222420"," It's going to get really fucking cool."
"1222620","1225760"," So stick around, hang out."
"1226540","1231260"," If you don't want that stuff, you'll always have that option to not have that stuff. "
"1231440","1233880"," You'll always have a free option for you."
"1234020","1238500"," So don't feel like you're going to get left behind or I'm going to sell out from you or you"
"1238500","1238840"," can't."
"1238940","1243000"," You're not, you know, I'm going to do something differently than what you've experienced here. "
"1243460","1247400"," There's one, there's one small thing that I have to talk to you guys about."
"1248020","1250320"," There's one small thing that I can't continue with."
"1251700","1254200"," And there's going to be some changes to the discord. "
"1255140","1261420"," I'll go into that later, what those changes are, but we have one fucking problem."
"1261680","1264820"," And that is we have a financial discord, right?"
"1265120","1266300"," We're not a gaming discord."
"1267620","1269160"," We're not a gaming discord. "
"1269480","1275960"," If we had a gaming discord and I was 12 years old, I buy a game and then I don't"
"1275960","1276640"," spend any money."
"1276980","1278700"," I might spend some money, right?"
"1278700","1282920"," I might go out and get upgrades and stuff like that for 10 bucks or 20 bucks, something like that."
"1283360","1288540"," But because we're in finance discord, we attract scammers. "
"1289200","1295720"," We attract bots, all kinds of insane shit that the admins deal with in the background."
"1296920","1298220"," And it's wild."
"1298600","1305800"," You'd be shocked at the amount of work we do every single day to try to thwart that. "
"1305800","1308160"," So there's one thing that will change slightly."
"1308420","1310740"," It'll be very much like the chat on YouTube and Twitch."
"1311200","1317340"," It's to deter scammers and scammers, bots and all that kind of stuff. "
"1317620","1321920"," And it's for the safety of our community that we have to do that at some point in the coming"
"1321920","1322260"," days."
"1322800","1323860"," So that's what that would be."
"1323900","1328740"," The only change that I see that might be detrimental or pissed someone off or something like that. "
"1328740","1336300"," But other than that, well, we will always remain true to that original promise that we made to as a"
"1336300","1336520"," community."
"1336840","1339600"," And I want all of you to know that I fucking love every last one of you guys."
"1339740","1342420"," Well, all women men, I don't care what you call yourself. "
"1343160","1344500"," PC them what they would."
"1344600","1345260"," Paul takes."
"1345440","1346440"," I don't care what politics are. "
"1346920","1352680"," I want to express my gratitude to all of you for getting together as a group of retail traders and"
"1352680","1354100"," focusing on why we're here."
"1354220","1355640"," So I really appreciate that."
"1355960","1357400"," You guys have been fucking awesome. "
"1357400","1361000"," Best trading group in my view on the entire fucking Internet."
"1361000","1361780"," You guys are."
"1362440","1364280"," I want you guys to know one last thing. "
"1366000","1372020"," For a lot of years, I didn't see young people learning a lot about the indexes."
"1372400","1374280"," It's like you get stuck in memes."
"1374560","1378400"," You get stuck in Tesla or Apple or whatever your favorite thing is AMD or whatever. "
"1378800","1383920"," You guys are spending time learning about the indexes with me."
"1383920","1384280"," Right."
"1384680","1389400"," And this is going to be a fucking tool for you to make money for the rest of your career"
"1389400","1390080"," in this market. "
"1390400","1393160"," You can go off and chase Tesla's and GME's and all that stuff."
"1393680","1399340"," But you having that to party or toolbox that knows that you can always go back to an index and"
"1399340","1402160"," make a living from it fucking warms my heart."
"1402700","1405740"," I kid you not like it makes me want to cry right now at this moment that. "
"1406800","1417890"," Hold on a"
"1417890","1418290"," second."
"1419110","1420790"," You guys are getting something that."
"1421790","1423010"," It's going to change your life. "
"1423150","1425730"," You can look back at five, ten years, twenty or something like that and be like."
"1426610","1427790"," I got that fucking tool."
"1428370","1432950"," I can trade that fucking index and come in any day of the fucking week and trade that fucking"
"1432950","1433170"," thing. "
"1433930","1434950"," There's liquidity there."
"1435550","1440230"," There's a community of old people on Fintuit."
"1441670","1445090"," Old traders, four traders, guys like Gem out there. "
"1445090","1452790"," Get guys like that out there that are passing all that shit down to us and warms my heart knowing"
"1452790","1464550"," that there's going to be a whole other fucking generation of index traders for"
"1464550","1466430"," another ten years, twenty years, you know."
"1473910","1478090"," We get like 130,000 unique views on the show every month."
"1479010","1482530"," You're talking about impacting like just so many retailers like so sick. "
"1486850","1487870"," Bad as fuck dude."
"1487990","1492210"," You guys want you to know if you're watching to be as the baddest motherfuckers out there in my"
"1492210","1492450"," view."
"1492650","1493010"," Period. "
"1499680","1500740"," Baddest motherfuckers in the planet."
"1500920","1502100"," You guys are the whole next generation."
"1502540","1504560"," You guys are going to be around here five, ten years now. "
"1505880","1507820"," You guys are going to be the gems out there."
"1507920","1508880"," The gem croissants."
"1509080","1514900"," You guys are going to be the, you know, like the, uh, Jedi Markuses and guys like that. "
"1520670","1521530"," Very enough of me."
"1521670","1522710"," I'm going to be quiet for a minute."
"1522810","1524190"," I'm going to get control of myself. "
"1525050","1526750"," Um, but I love all of you guys."
"1559420","1560140"," All right."
"1563690","1564450"," Give me a second here. "
"1579700","1581100"," I love all you guys out there."
"1581180","1582360"," I just saw your chat."
"1582640","1583800"," I love all you guys out there. "
"1604930","1607510"," I say, Momo, I watched Chewy, baby."
"1607910","1609330"," What did I tell you about Chewy, brother?"
"1610430","1611870"," What did I say, Chewy?"
"1613130","1614230"," What did I tell you about?"
"1614370","1615090"," I saw that Chewy."
"1615230","1616550"," I looked at it last night, Doggy. "
"1616650","1619130"," I saw it swing right down there and slap it, didn't it?"
"1623050","1623690"," Momo, land."
"1623930","1624510"," I checked, brother."
"1624670","1625770"," I was looking last night, man. "
"1625910","1627450"," I followed up on you last night, brother."
"1627890","1628970"," I saw Chewy last night."
"1629290","1630370"," I paid attention after clothes. "
"1631170","1631850"," I watched that, man."
"1638370","1639670"," Where have you been talking, monkey?"
"1652140","1652660"," Fuck, yeah."
"1652820","1653800"," I love all you guys out there. "
"1654480","1654820"," All right."
"1654900","1655060"," All right."
"1655500","1656180"," What are we doing here?"
"1656320","1659620"," What do we know about where we are in the structure right now?"
"1659760","1660360"," What do we know?"
"1660520","1662840"," If you had no other tools on you right now, you had nothing. "
"1663280","1663400"," Right?"
"1664240","1665140"," What would you know about this?"
"1665480","1667500"," We back checked the one minute trigger, back to five minute trigger."
"1668000","1669200"," On a successful retest."
"1669460","1670260"," What are we looking for?"
"1670840","1673280"," Let's get rid of all this shit right here. "
"1675840","1677640"," What are we looking for here, right?"
"1678540","1680700"," We're looking for previous highs, right?"
"1681780","1683380"," We got a pivot point right here."
"1683460","1684060"," Hold on a second here."
"1685980","1687160"," What do we got right here?"
"1687560","1689260"," We got all the sellers right here, right?"
"1689980","1690780"," What do we got right there?"
"1690940","1692200"," Some more sellers up here, right?"
"1694060","1696280"," Now, that's intraday. "
"1697440","1698580"," That's intraday, right?"
"1698580","1700460"," That's our weekly basis too, right?"
"1701060","1701820"," So let's look at the week."
"1705030","1707050"," We got some other highs up here, don't we?"
"1707490","1709450"," Get all that shit back here, don't we?"
"1709970","1711390"," Don't forget that little one up there."
"1712430","1714110"," Forget that bad boy up there. "
"1715210","1715690"," Right?"
"1715990","1717210"," You got this one right here, right?"
"1718430","1720450"," Got that little bad boy back here."
"1721810","1725170"," But what do you have on the like one minute chart?"
"1726770","1729510"," You have this little guy right here, don't you?"
"1730610","1733570"," So forget about all that shit up there for right now."
"1733570","1734250"," We don't care. "
"1734470","1735650"," We don't care about this."
"1736090","1737470"," We don't care about that."
"1737610","1738810"," We don't care about any of that stuff. "
"1739430","1740730"," What do we care about?"
"1742250","1745350"," Care about this little guy right here, right?"
"1745810","1746770"," This little pivot point."
"1747290","1749030"," And what's our previous pivot point?"
"1749550","1750310"," Right down here, right?"
"1751030","1752410"," We got this little one right here."
"1753070","1754570"," This is all you're concerned with, right?"
"1754730","1754990"," Right there?"
"1756650","1758470"," And this one right here, right?"
"1759890","1760250"," That's it. "
"1761130","1762310"," That's all you care about."
"1764030","1767890"," You know that you have only a few minutes, right?"
"1768890","1771790"," 15 minute intervals we talk about, right?"
"1772030","1776770"," To break above and catch a new high."
"1777210","1778030"," Even if it's just the tick. "
"1778950","1783170"," Even if it comes back down, it's telling you, Hey, we're bullish and we're going to make that next"
"1783170","1784130"," pivot, right?"
"1785310","1789070"," If we don't have this, so we watch, right?"
"1789070","1790090"," We're sitting here watching."
"1791150","1793630"," We're just watching right now, right?"
"1793810","1797850"," You want to see that previous target taken out to get bullish again, right?"
"1798310","1800930"," To give you the chance to make that next target above, right?"
"1801070","1803330"," The next pivot, right?"
"1803450","1805310"," If it doesn't happen, what are we looking for?"
"1805890","1807410"," The next pivot down, right?"
"1808350","1814210"," If we fail to make the new high right here, it shows weakness on the one minute trigger, right?"
"1815330","1817410"," Not necessarily bearish, just the one minute trigger."
"1817910","1818370"," That's it. "
"1819710","1821790"," So what would happen if we failed that?"
"1822730","1825330"," It would come back down and check the five minute trigger, right?"
"1826010","1829690"," Come back down here, check the five minute trigger."
"1829870","1831090"," Is that bearish?"
"1831770","1833270"," No, right?"
"1834290","1835750"," It's not bearish, is it?"
"1836530","1837330"," We're just checking it."
"1838310","1841130"," Come back up up here, right?"
"1842470","1846550"," If we come back up and touch that right there, we're bullish, aren't we?"
"1846550","1848730"," We were just doing a back check on a five minute. "
"1849310","1852590"," Come back down here and then you can take that."
"1852750","1853990"," You're like, hell yeah, right?"
"1854470","1855310"," I can go up here."
"1858290","1867660"," Now, let's say we go up there and we fail right here, right?"
"1868360","1869360"," What does that tell you?"
"1869740","1873540"," Well, we're not bearish, but we could consolidate down here for a little while. "
"1873760","1875060"," Get caught in the finger trap, right?"
"1889000","1898520"," Let's say we come down here and we catch that bounce and it's very weak, right?"
"1899420","1901660"," We start bouncing down back in here."
"1901660","1902760"," What is that telling you?"
"1903800","1907280"," It's telling you that we're going to start to get bearish, right?"
"1908120","1910180"," Expect that roll over here, right?"
"1911260","1915920"," And even if you blast down through here, you know you're still going to be given a chance to get"
"1915920","1918760"," out before the big roll down comes, right?"
"1918760","1921880"," You can do this on every timeframe."
"1922340","1927540"," You can do this on a five minute, a one minute, an hour, a day, a week, a month, a"
"1927540","1927960"," quarter. "
"1930970","1933850"," Very simple stuff, very easy ways to figure out."
"1934250","1938510"," Did you need, if we blasted down, did you need to catch all of this here?"
"1938910","1941090"," No, you need to watch this to get bearish."
"1942330","1944830"," Your percentage of wind gets higher. "
"1946010","1949730"," The more that you be patient, sit on your hands and watch the structure."
"1950730","1951830"," Same thing on the upside."
"1952710","1953730"," Patience on the upside. "
"1954090","1955290"," You pull back, check the one minute."
"1955630","1965010"," You wait for it to construct a bullish thesis to the upside, a neutral trade sideways or then a"
"1965010","1965670"," bearish trade."
"1966290","1972450"," And your wind percentages go up if you wait and tag that one or even this in reverse to the"
"1972450","1972770"," upside. "
"1972770","1975710"," Wait to tag it to the upside to get that squeeze."
"1976750","1977870"," Timing matters."
"1980850","1981970"," Execution matters. "
"1982670","1983690"," It's not good enough."
"1984830","1985770"," It isn't."
"1985910","1987950"," It is not good enough that you called it. "
"1988670","1997610"," You need to have tools in place so you can take the only the choices trades that you set them"
"1997610","2001390"," up with your tools and say, okay, we did this, we did that, we did this."
"2001390","2003930"," And then you put your risk on."
"2004190","2005630"," You know where your stops are. "
"2005850","2010490"," You know where if it goes against you, when to get out and you manage your risk."
"2011250","2014510"," You're not going to win every one of them, but you want to be winning seven of them."
"2015470","2016390"," Nine of them. "
"2017330","2018510"," That's your goal."
"2019530","2022190"," You don't want to be listening to people out there tell you you should."
"2022330","2024270"," Oh, you only need to win three or six. "
"2024810","2028330"," They don't the fuck they're talking about after the taxes after the fees."
"2029190","2031790"," If you're only winning three trades."
"2032310","2035650"," And then you have one huge blow up. "
"2035650","2036390"," You get greedy."
"2036810","2037330"," You do something."
"2037610","2038230"," You blow up your account. "
"2038850","2041790"," You should be a fucking tactful tactician."
"2042010","2046010"," Like you're just you are you are you are like a surgeon."
"2047409","2047969"," Patience. "
"2048870","2049889"," Be a surgeon."

"2078239","2081520"," Just said learn so much from your gift and trade with you for over a year. "
"2081639","2082100"," Thank you."
"2082360","2083560"," Man is an emotional creature."
"2083780","2084060"," Let it rip. "
"2084219","2085300"," Probably your family."
"2085440","2086020"," You're my family."
"2086120","2086840"," You're security strap. "
"2091030","2091630"," All right."
"2091750","2092590"," Let's see what happens here."
"2093429","2094409"," Let's watch this unfold. "
"2095350","2097490"," Now we can look at other places too, right?"
"2098130","2099310"," So you got this tool here."
"2099510","2100290"," What else do you have?"
"2100950","2104510"," You can start check H Y G start check VIX, right?"
"2106210","2107570"," You can check other indexes."
"2107570","2109830"," You can check XLF and see how strong it is. "
"2109950","2110830"," You can check sectors."
"2111930","2113870"," Is utilities ramping right now?"
"2115010","2115450"," Right."
"2115550","2116470"," Are we rotating in utilities?"
"2117170","2119230"," Are we rotating on a big tech, the mag seven?"
"2120030","2121730"," Are we rotating back into mag seven?"
"2121810","2123730"," Are we rotating in the small caps?"
"2124490","2126830"," You can have a screener up at home and just have what?"
"2127050","2128550"," You can split a weeble chart. "
"2128690","2130510"," I think you can split like 12 times."
"2132610","2137690"," If you're too poor to own a second screen at home, go down to a Salvation Army and buy one."
"2137830","2138430"," They're five bucks. "
"2139570","2141390"," Get a USB to HDMI."
"2141610","2142510"," Stick that on your computer."
"2142770","2143690"," Now you got two screens. "
"2145710","2148030"," It doesn't have to look prettier setup at home."
"2148970","2150010"," You get a shitty setup."
"2150010","2153650"," As long as you got two, three screeners over there at home, you start watching other sectors. "
"2154390","2155290"," You can watch the 10 year."

"2156730","2157590"," You can watch DLT. "
"2157790","2158030"," Gold."
"2160970","2164890"," Put together another picture as this happens and say to yourself, is this the top?"
"2166050","2167250"," Well, this here in folds."
"2167790","2168750"," I'm going to go check out. "
"2169910","2171230"," Take a walk around the market."
"2171330","2172710"," I used to call it in the stream, right?"
"2172850","2174770"," Let's take a walk around the market and check out what's going on."
"2175230","2177530"," What are the mechanics going on in the back end of this market?"
"2192920","2193540"," All right. "
"2194860","2197240"," I got another issue for you guys this morning."
"2198020","2203100"," I got like three big meetings today at a launch this morning."
"2203260","2204720"," I didn't get together with John L."
"2205320","2206200"," I got to get together. "
"2206600","2209160"," You guys, Morpheus, I got to get together with Morpheus."
"2209860","2211160"," I have to get together with Binky."
"2211540","2212720"," I have to get together with Joe Donut. "
"2213680","2216860"," We've got three huge meetings to finalize a bunch of stuff."
"2217020","2221520"," I got to run my credit card like 10 times and make sure that nobody gets fucked in this process."
"2221520","2222560"," We don't break something. "
"2224880","2232380"," And I've got an army of people that are going to be manning like email terminals and all kinds of"
"2232380","2240230"," other stuff to make sure we make as smooth as possible in the next couple of days."
"2241120","2243380"," I'm very anxious."
"2243680","2245220"," I'm very anxiety-ridden right now. "
"2246440","2250900"," So I have to work in the background here this morning."
"2252320","2253720"," I will be here with you."
"2254460","2261220"," If you don't understand what I've told you so far about the mechanics of a trade, we have trusted"
"2261220","2264080"," people in our chat in our stream. "
"2264120","2266500"," Matter of fact, I'm going to turn the chat on for everybody right now."
"2267540","2269860"," We turn the chat on because I'm not going to be here."
"2270020","2270840"," So hold on one second here. "
"2270900","2273160"," I'm here, but I'm only going to stop it on big moves."
"2274940","2277340"," Like we did yesterday at the close, right?"
"2277920","2283720"," And the people that stuck around yesterday in that close, I came on the stream yesterday at four o "
"2283720","2284100","'clock, right?"
"2284380","2285680"," Three forty-five, something like that."
"2285680","2288960"," That last hammer down, I'm like, yeah, I'm buying this shit. "
"2289180","2292480"," So I will be here with you, but I have to get jump on some meetings."
"2295060","2300180"," So here, I'm going to make sure that everybody can chat today."
"2302120","2305140"," So you just need to be a subscriber for one minute. "

"2317320","2318260"," And I've got long time. "
"2318400","2322340"," I've got shot collars here that don't pay, but they're watching the show every day."
"2323000","2324260"," And they're long time followers."
"2324660","2332240"," And I want to make sure these shot collars are able to be in the stream for you guys this"
"2334390","2334770"," morning. "
"2338700","2341060"," The chat is now open for everybody this morning."
"2341780","2343040"," How are you all doing out there?"
"2343740","2346820"," Hope you're all doing well if you're watching the show at home in your office somewhere."
"2346820","2347960"," You're in an office. "
"2347960","2349420"," You're in a hedge fund out in Europe."
"2349860","2350380"," Good morning."
"2350620","2351440"," You're in a hedge fund in Japan. "
"2351640","2352020"," Good morning."
"2352500","2355220"," You're in a hedge fund in New York or some strip mall in middle America."

"2373760","2375460"," They make you wait a minute or some shit like that. "
"2375460","2376700"," Let me check YouTube really quick."
"2377360","2378360"," Make sure I got this right."
"2379060","2379740"," I'm tired. "
"2383540","2384580"," Hold on here."
"2387140","2390200"," Okay, so now anybody can chat right away on YouTube."
"2390480","2391920"," I said it to one minute. "
"2392460","2393080"," It's now anyway."
"2393360","2395300"," You just click subscribe and you can start blowing it up."
"2398920","2400740"," You want to watch that price action?"
"2401060","2402720"," You guys already know what this price action is, right?"
"2405100","2406940"," You guys are price action traders. "
"2407400","2408100"," Momentum traders."
"2408780","2409860"," That's what you guys are."
"2411140","2415480"," You guys are Momo traders up and down, up and down. "
"2415660","2415920"," Up and down."
"2416120","2416980"," Momo traders up and down."
"2417140","2417760"," Price action traders. "
"2418300","2421480"," Price is king to be a t-shirt that you wear."
"2422040","2423120"," Price is king."
"2427540","2428220"," Hey, Gigi. "
"2428320","2428780"," What up to the point?"
"2428960","2429240"," What up brother?"
"2430380","2431140"," Morna Angelius."
"2432500","2432900"," Angelus."
"2433180","2433920"," I love that fucking name. "
"2434000","2434420"," It's a good name."
"2434980","2437360"," If that's like a play on Los Angeles right on."
"2438460","2440000"," That was an L.A. boy for a little while. "
"2440260","2442320"," Spent a couple of years living in L.A., Santa Monica."
"2442740","2444020"," Around 9th in Michigan."
"2444760","2445940"," I lived right by the beach. "
"2447160","2449000"," It wasn't actually nine streets either."
"2449460","2452520"," It's only six streets, I think, on 9th Street to the beach."
"2454100","2454340"," I think. "
"2454780","2456960"," I think we're wrong on that, but I think there's only six streets."
"2457660","2459880"," But I lived right by the sandwich shop over there."
"2460020","2460580"," We get the Godmother. "
"2461260","2462040"," The Bay City delis."
"2462380","2463160"," Lived like a block away."
"2467350","2467830"," Morna. "
"2467890","2468170"," Come on, Michael."
"2468810","2469070"," How are you?"
"2472480","2473260"," Chris Knight."
"2473440","2474040"," What up brother?"
"2482180","2483000"," Mission possible. "
"2483360","2483980"," Seven, seven, seven."
"2484120","2484980"," What's going on?"
"2487520","2488520"," Hell yeah, Nino."
"2490880","2492020"," Who just donated?"
"2492440","2492740"," $69. "
"2493420","2494280"," Who the fuck did that?"
"2495340","2496220"," Stay humble."
"2496740","2497360"," I love you brother."
"2498100","2498500"," Oh, dude. "
"2498660","2499760"," Is that stepping stone trainer?"
"2501380","2502920"," Is that stepping stone trainer?"
"2503420","2506400"," Is that stepping stone trainer out there?"
"2507180","2507980"," What up, man?"
"2508440","2509240"," Seven stone trainer."
"2509400","2511140"," If that's you, man, you're like, you and I were like, what?"
"2511320","2513160"," You and I on Twitter, right at one point?"
"2516300","2517780"," If that's you, I love you, man."
"2522940","2525160"," Doesn't macro matter at all?"
"2525480","2525680"," Yes. "
"2526040","2528360"," Matter of fact, I was talking to Binky about macro."
"2530080","2532480"," We were discussing macro yesterday and."
"2533960","2535020"," Front running too. "
"2535540","2538440"," And how people have a lot of stuff wrong right now."
"2538580","2538900"," Front running."
"2539300","2540740"," We're discussing small caps. "
"2542920","2546400"," And some people were like doom and gloom for small caps."
"2547060","2555600"," And I was like, you know, if you go back to when we began the rate cycle, there were bears"
"2555600","2558400"," that said sell mid and small caps."
"2558960","2560120"," Rate cycle starting. "
"2561880","2564160"," And I was like, fuck yeah, that's what you do, right?"
"2564620","2565780"," We're all in agreement on this, right?"
"2565960","2566380"," You're in agreement."
"2566580","2567520"," I'm not agreeing with your agreement, right?"
"2569560","2574660"," And potential ending to a rate cycle hasn't confirmed yet, but potential ending, right?"
"2576540","2579300"," We're hearing people out there still say short all that shit."
"2579620","2580340"," And I'm like. "
"2582500","2583860"," That's some forward looking shit."
"2584740","2587000"," You know, so we're talking about that."
"2587000","2587660"," Does macro matter?"
"2587780","2588560"," Fuck yeah, it matters. "
"2589620","2591180"," But oftentimes people get it wrong."
"2592940","2594180"," It's impact on the market."
"2594620","2595500"," Where should it go, right?"
"2595700","2598620"," Good news, good news, bad news, bad news is bad news. "
"2598960","2601060"," When is bad news, bad news, all that kind of stuff."
"2602220","2608140"," A lot of that has a lot of overlap in the front running and pricing in of that stuff, right?"
"2608340","2609200"," So what ends up happening, right?"
"2609320","2614060"," As they come back to you and they say, oh, the rate cycles, the rate cycles done, you should buy"
"2614060","2614540"," smoke apps."
"2615060","2616900"," But they ran it up six months before. "
"2617360","2618180"," You know what I'm saying?"
"2618720","2620640"," They dump into you, right?"
"2620760","2621480"," They sell into you."
"2622260","2623140"," It's too late."
"2623440","2627320"," So you have to be one step ahead at all times, even if it doesn't go. "
"2627580","2628160"," That's another thing."
"2628300","2629260"," Even if it doesn't go that way."
"2631020","2633700"," So they'll front run a move before it happens. "
"2634440","2638340"," And even if it doesn't happen, they'll just then just pull the plug on it."
"2638460","2639000"," Does that make sense?"
"2640180","2641020"," They beat you."
"2643900","2644320"," Thanks. "
"2644320","2644640"," I'm ahead of you."
"2644820","2647820"," Every step of the way on every timeframe."
"2649880","2650860"," Good morning, Johnny. "
"2651100","2651580"," What's up?"
"2651700","2652100"," My brother."
"2662980","2665220"," Oh, do not become a member."
"2665460","2666400"," Listen to me closely. "
"2669040","2672020"," Do not sign up to become a member today, please."
"2672460","2675640"," Like don't be signing up to YouTube or Twitch or any of that shit."
"2676920","2678120"," Stop signing up. "
"2678660","2680160"," Just give it a day if you okay?"
"2680440","2680780"," Just chill."
"2680780","2681940"," Still daddy."
"2683600","2684040"," Chill. "
"2684300","2686480"," Just chill for a day or two."
"2686700","2688620"," Don't be signing up for like the five dollar membership."
"2688620","2689320"," Any of that shit. "
"2689480","2690720"," Don't sign up for that stuff, please."
"2691860","2693560"," Just hang out for a day or two."
"2693860","2694300"," Hang out. "
"2694420","2694740"," Just chill."
"2700000","2704940"," So Ryan Vargas said thanks, but the US markets have been too stretched by nearly 12% without an"
"2704940","2707700"," even 1% correction that doesn't seem healthy, right?"
"2712160","2715780"," Seasonally, from a seasonal standpoint, you're shorting the wrong time of the year."
"2716420","2720860"," If we were in February or April and the market was going up, I would agree with you. "
"2722480","2723900"," Not this time of year."
"2724900","2727960"," This is a market function that takes place at the end of every year."
"2728780","2730700"," So you got some tax loss harvesting going on. "
"2730900","2735240"," We've got pump up your tickers that have produced to max them out."
"2735240","2740600"," We have tickers out there that have not produced, but haven't gone down to the depths of hell,"
"2740600","2740980"," either."
"2741180","2743180"," So I'm going to rip those ones up and into the year. "
"2743960","2751340"," There's a lot of mechanics going on in the market right now that that's end of a year function of"
"2751340","2751940"," end of year."
"2753860","2755920"," We also have some other issues here too."
"2756000","2757760"," We've got some gamma issues for bears. "
"2758720","2764720"," One of them being that we're creating a gamma floor and we're expanding the call walls to the"
"2764720","2771620"," upside and we've got this stupid fucking pin on 4,600 and it's a magnet right now."
"2771700","2775120"," Then we've got the JPM caller working on the end of the year."
"2775620","2781980"," There's a lot of moving parts right now that are going to infuriate a lot of people. "
"2783340","2788340"," Now I posted about this and I harped on it and people didn't want to listen."
"2789300","2790540"," I was like, okay, fuck it."
"2790640","2791120"," That's what it is. "
"2791440","2793780"," So it's not like this isn't hindsight trading here."
"2794000","2798200"," This is, you're told you before and it worked out just like this."
"2799600","2801320"," It's a function of market mechanics. "
"2801900","2803340"," Everyone knows that it's not everyone."
"2803560","2804980"," The smart people know what's going on."
"2805960","2807780"," A lot of us are like scratching our heads, right?"
"2808040","2811960"," Why don't I understand what's going on in the market right now?"
"2813920","2815140"," What up Arthur Lopez?"
"2821250","2823110"," Yeah, that oil yesterday, Johnny. "
"2823370","2827950"," I was looking at CL yesterday and I was like, woo, we got to buy that oil down there."
"2832380","2833180"," All right."
"2833200","2833460"," All right. "
"2833560","2833660"," All right."
"2833840","2833940"," All right."
"2834000","2834420"," I got to go. "
"2834540","2837160"," I got to get these guys to be pissed at me if I don't go."
"2838860","2840180"," These guys going to be angry."
"2843170","2843930"," Right on Ryan. "
"2844510","2845170"," Yeah, man."
"2845390","2849090"," There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a pin right now in the market."
"2849090","2853970"," There's a, anyone tell out they're telling you we're topping out of their fucking minds. "
"2854150","2855150"," They don't know what they're talking about."
"2855530","2859950"," Anyone out there telling you we're going to fucking 480 like today out of their fucking minds."
"2860050","2861150"," They don't know what they're talking about. "
"2861970","2863370"," There's a market pin here."
"2863930","2869170"," Now we can unclench a little bit into next week."
"2870030","2872990"," There's a, there's a high probably and into the 15th. "
"2873310","2878450"," We have another gamma bar that's hidden of this giant gamma bar that we have for the end of the"
"2878450","2879590"," end of the quarter."
"2880330","2881410"," That's like a magnet."
"2882130","2885950"," We have some weakness coming into the markets right now. "
"2886750","2892130"," Unless something changes for the 15th as soon as that bar goes away, right?"
"2892290","2895390"," Into the 15th is a little bit of an unclench coming now."
"2895650","2899510"," The downside expected downside from that will be price dependent."
"2900350","2903050"," So it would not shock me to see us run up. "
"2903950","2904510"," Right."
"2904510","2911030"," So once that, once that gamma, once that gamma starts to have less of an effect in the 15th, you"
"2911030","2915450"," could see that market pull down and back into Wednesday of next week."
"2915610","2924470"," Now we do have of course some pretty big fucking ball on Jerome Powell and his decision on when, I"
"2924470","2925450"," believe it's Wednesday, right?"
"2927090","2932590"," So we'll pay attention to that volatility and I'll be honest with you guys. "
"2932590","2936710"," I want to short the fuck out of that shit."
"2937010","2940010"," So I think it's a weird thing."
"2940290","2941030"," It's a weird thing. "
"2941550","2949490"," Dealers might have to chase upside, but if they don't, if they don't, this is a great trap for"
"2949490","2949690"," bulls."
"2950130","2951390"," So I don't know."
"2951530","2951930"," I don't know. "
"2952990","2957230"," The only thing I can tell you is there's, I hate saying this because not my word."
"2957390","2959090"," This comes from Brent and all those guys."
"2959090","2963970"," There's a window of weakness coming up into the 15th. "
"2964130","2965070"," I'll say that."
"2965170","2965370"," Okay."
"2965570","2966630"," Does it mean we're going down?"
"2967110","2969970"," No, but there's a, there's a possibility. "
"2970390","2978210"," There's a window for you to possibly have a pretty big fucking short, but price where prices will"
"2978210","2979970"," matter when you time that short, right?"
"2980130","2984670"," You can be right all day long, but if you're fucking shorting for 60, you're not shorting for 52"
"2984670","2985630"," from yesterday, right?"
"2986550","2988950"," So price will matter on that trade."
"2989170","2991630"," You have to be Johnny on the spot on that trade."
"3001210","3001650"," Okay. "
"3001870","3003310"," I will be back with you guys."
"3003810","3008130"," I'm going to turn on some, I'm going to turn on the, the new squacker here for you."
"3008610","3010350"," Look at that natural gas, baby. "
"3010530","3010730"," Whoo."
"3013710","3014470"," Naddy gas."
"3016270","3017370"," The widow maker. "
"3019560","3020400"," All right."
"3020560","3020700"," All right."
"3020820","3022400"," Hold on. "
"3022400","3022580"," Come on."
"3022700","3025080"," I'm going to turn on some CNBC in the background for you too."
"3026540","3028040"," We can get some CNBC going. "
"3033280","3035860"," You know, before we turn CNBC on, I'm going to talk to you guys."
"3036060","3036160"," Okay."
"3036400","3039300"," I'm going to give you guys, before I leave, I'm going to give you guys at least an update here. "
"3039320","3040400"," I'm going to talk to you guys about some stuff."
"3046440","3047080"," Oh, dude."
"3049460","3049900"," I'm reading. "
"3050140","3053280"," I'm not going to read this to you because these guys have been wrong all fucking week."
"3054840","3057460"," They've been chasing being right all week long."
"3059320","3061180"," But I love to see it. "
"3063900","3064460"," Okay."
"3064760","3071660"," So I want you guys to know that 45 15 is still the floor."
"3072060","3075440"," Remember that depends on papers out at home and write this stuff down. "
"3075520","3075680"," Okay."
"3076240","3078680"," 45 15 is the market floor."
"3079240","3080680"," Beers need to get underneath it. "
"3080680","3083700"," If they get underneath it, they're going to make some money."
"3085060","3089880"," If you want to know what I mean by there's if you guys want to know what I mean by"
"3089880","3090420"," a magnet."
"3091620","3092020"," Right. "
"3092040","3093000"," It's right there."
"3093920","3095680"," And it grows every day."
"3095760","3096760"," It was like here. "
"3097460","3098120"," Now it's here."
"3098380","3098960"," Now it's here."
"3099260","3099840"," Now it's here. "
"3100040","3100600"," Now it's here."
"3101260","3101360"," Now it's here."
"3101360","3101840"," Now it's here. "
"3102060","3102620"," And now it's here."
"3102720","3103880"," It's just getting stupid now."
"3104480","3106660"," So this is why we're not going down. "
"3106800","3109380"," If you want to know why it's because of that fucking thing right there."
"3109680","3109860"," Okay."
"3109860","3111800"," That gamobar right there. "
"3112280","3115600"," Parts of this gamobar expires on the 15th."
"3115660","3116640"," That's 4600."
"3123820","3125000"," So you have that information. "
"3128740","3130120"," Hang tight one second here."
"3135660","3137140"," I'm going to read this to you."
"3137320","3140440"," The narrative du jour is still well and alive. "
"3141760","3149160"," Winners momentum stocks get monetized while underdeveloped pockets are getting bid."
"3150030","3157240"," The striking feature of today's session was the rally at long end Tretinoats that ignored the"
"3157240","3160460"," substantial supply overhang while oil was getting hammered."
"3161840","3163460"," Sub 70 bucks. "
"3164040","3165420"," Despite OPEC cutting production."
"3165700","3169560"," Very clearly the market is aggressively pricing in a soft landing scenario."
"3170780","3175660"," Nomura's Magellia made a good point today saying that the conditions simply aren't there yet for"
"3175660","3178060"," any sort of equities crash risk. "
"3179160","3182540"," Because we just aren't seeing funds long enough in the market yet."
"3182820","3188400"," It's only when funds are brick long that this forces them into a position where hedges are"
"3188400","3195500"," required, which then puts dealers into a short gamma short Vega position in a spot down market."
"3195840","3198500"," Only then can the games begin. "
"3199800","3205260"," This is illustrated by the put call open interest ratio which dropped by 35 BPS recently."
"3206000","3209340"," Tomorrow's markets will receive initial claims before NFP print on Friday."
"3209340","3210900"," Hopefully we'll shake things up a bit. "
"3211120","3211280"," Nope."
"3211780","3212640"," Didn't happen."
"3214020","3214540"," Right. "
"3215620","3217680"," And I want to tell you guys something else."
"3217880","3224620"," If you have the time to read the book that I've been pushing to you all year long that got"
"3224620","3226520"," pushed to me from Jedi markets."
"3226860","3230740"," That was the hedge fund market market wizards book right. "
"3230740","3235340"," You know that the last asshole in the room is an elephant."
"3235980","3236860"," It is banks."
"3237240","3240180"," Banks are always the last to join the party. "
"3240820","3242060"," And they're not going to tell you that."
"3242360","3246680"," And what they're going to do is they're like late late bull run participants."
"3247840","3255620"," You have these early risk on a very risky small tiny tiny hedge funds usually pick ass traders big"
"3255620","3255880"," banks. "
"3256380","3257360"," They're the early guys."
"3257720","3258580"," They come in very early."
"3259680","3263720"," And they're the market makers actual market makers to come in and do this as well. "
"3263940","3267080"," They're scooping up the shit that you don't want unless they're committing fraud."
"3267980","3269680"," And then they ramp all this up."
"3269800","3270880"," We have this big bull run. "
"3270980","3273560"," And then the last guy and the last guy to commit is an elephant."
"3274740","3278360"," That elephant is usually like JPM GS those kind of banks."
"3278360","3282540"," They come in with heavy risk and they start loading the fuck up. "
"3282600","3284480"," So that's what they're doing quietly in the background."
"3288730","3290270"," I'm also going to show you."
"3290610","3293870"," I'm also going to show you the I'm also going to show you this here. "
"3294050","3294270"," Okay."
"3294670","3299470"," I want to show you guys the momentum risk ratio."
"3299570","3300310"," Hold on here. "
"3313680","3315200"," I'm going to post it on Fintuit."
"3315240","3315560"," Okay."
"3345080","3347280"," I posted that on Fintuit for you. "
"3354240","3355300"," That there for you."
"3374900","3378120"," Tomorrow we have the US unemployment report."
"3378380","3379760"," We've got the US unemployment rate. "
"3379760","3383460"," We've got US hourly wages, hourly wages year over year and consumer sentiment."
"3384080","3386580"," Next week we have no news on Monday."
"3387520","3394120"," On Tuesday we have consumer price index, core CPI, CPI year over year, core CPI year over year. "
"3394660","3396800"," We have the monthly US federal budget on Tuesday."
"3397500","3399480"," On Wednesday we get the PPI."
"3399740","3402440"," We get core PPI, PPI over year. "
"3403580","3404740"," Then we get the big boy."
"3405060","3411840"," That is the FOMC interest rate decision at 2 p.m. At 2.30 you get a presser from Jerome"
"3411840","3412260"," Powell."
"3412480","3414140"," That's Wednesday, big day next week. "
"3415380","3419960"," If you're a bull and you possibly think that you're going to see the move after."
"3420640","3424220"," You see the move after and not during, right?"
"3424380","3426980"," You can see a repressed move on Wednesday."
"3427820","3434780"," You're looking on Thursday for next week for the initial claims, job claims, the import price"
"3434780","3438120"," index, US retail sales, the big one that we have the Philly Fed survey. "
"3438620","3444640"," On Friday we got the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, industrial production and capacity and"
"3444640","3445180"," utilization."
"3445500","3449060"," So Thursday could be a big trigger for next week."
"3449140","3449840"," A little bit of blood here. "
"3450100","3451160"," No trade for me right now."
"3451260","3452460"," If I see anything, I'll buy it with you."
"3453720","3454120"," Okay. "
"3454720","3455700"," So what else we got here?"
"3457600","3459580"," I think that's all I got for you here in news."
"3462540","3464040"," And I'll shoot."
"3465080","3466260"," Hold on one second here. "
"3466320","3467020"," I got to do something else."
"3467940","3469760"," I missed one more thing for you today."
"3475160","3477540"," Hold on one second here. "
"3485520","3487280"," What am I looking for?"
"3498570","3500750"," What am I looking for here right there?"
"3509540","3510180"," Okay."
"3510680","3511120"," R one."
"3518700","3520320"," That's our one right there. "
"3522260","3524260"," Our two is for 60 50."
"3530940","3533560"," Our two is right there for 60 50."
"3537060","3538760"," We're in 462. "
"3538960","3542520"," Look at that range expansion."
"3543620","3545060"," 462 16."
"3548480","3550400"," That's our three right there. "
"3550640","3554080"," Eastern time, the US sells 80 billion dollars in four week bills."
"3554680","3557200"," That's pivot point today is where."
"3558020","3559440"," That's right. "
"3559580","3565300"," We're supposed to be."
"3565300","3565820"," We've got a."
"3568680","3570460"," Where S one is where."
"3574320","3574840"," There. "
"3591700","3593340"," Look at that range expansion."
"3593880","3598400"," We were asked to is way down here."
"3599840","3600360"," 448. "
"3600840","3604600"," You want to say up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for non"
"3604600","3605560"," farm payrolls."
"3606310","3608720"," 57 way down there."
"3608840","3610760"," Nice gorgeous range expansion. "
"3611260","3613000"," Play on spy."
"3613460","3615560"," Big, big moves expected on spy."
"3617400","3619760"," Big moves expected on spy. "
"3620600","3621760"," There's your R two."
"3622500","3624020"," There's your R three."
"3626100","3627420"," Right there. "
"3627660","3628780"," Put that right there for you."
"3629240","3630880"," You guys want to snap shot this at home?"
"3631040","3631300"," You can."
"3633620","3638290"," You guys want to see this on your way home right there. "
"3638670","3639150"," There's a."
"3639770","3641670"," I make this a five minute chart."
"3652450","3654370"," There's your negative gamma down there."
"3655050","3656510"," So you can see it right here. "
"3659050","3660510"," Series of lower highs."
"3660530","3661670"," You got a lower high here."
"3661990","3662930"," Lower high here. "
"3663150","3664410"," Lower high here."
"3664710","3665050"," Right there."
"3665050","3668350"," A little bit of a traditional chart. "
"3668650","3671030"," Say that's a bull flag."
"3674270","3675450"," There's going to tell you."
"3676490","3677490"," Keep going down. "
"3677690","3678930"," Keep going down to next week."
"3681310","3682950"," I like that trade person."
"3683090","3687770"," I like the idea of I love the idea of going down and you get that huge explosive move to"
"3687770","3688030"," the upside. "
"3689110","3691470"," But I don't think it really starts until next week."
"3691470","3693310"," Matter of fact, we'll show that to you right now."
"3694590","3695830"," Give me a second here. "
"3709770","3715690"," If someone was asking me where do we sell earlier or where does the roll come or we should be"
"3715690","3719690"," crashing or we should have doom and gloom and all that kind of crap."
"3719950","3721230"," So we're going to talk about that right now."
"3726290","3727130"," Sea zoneality. "
"3729210","3730930"," It's been a pretty normal year, right?"
"3730930","3735790"," We haven't had a big crash year, so we're going to expect to be pretty close to this this year."
"3736390","3737610"," There'll be some outside moves."
"3737950","3742130"," Outside moves, but on a larger time frame, it seems to be following pretty closely, right?"
"3744070","3746710"," So do you see this big drop right here?"
"3748210","3749710"," See that right there, right?"
"3750610","3751770"," And this is the. "
"3757270","3762430"," Call that the 200 and 39th session."
"3763790","3766250"," We got 237 down here, 241."
"3766890","3767010"," So. "
"3768550","3769830"," Let me get that right."
"3772670","3774570"," 240th session somewhere in there."
"3775210","3777470"," So if you're a bear and you're looking for that role. "
"3778590","3781110"," Some time into the end of Friday."
"3781710","3785050"," You want to be divesting yourself of small caps."
"3785650","3788930"," You're going to be divesting yourself of large caps. "
"3789630","3792590"," Or at least hedging yourself for some kind of a pullback."
"3793130","3797970"," Into that, that, that trading, that day of that trans trading session of the year."
"3798850","3800070"," Let's look at, um. "
"3801370","3803170"," Let's look at seasonality for NDX."
"3807670","3809190"," See that right there, right?"
"3809490","3810130"," Nice move down."
"3810130","3812230"," It's been following almost exactly right. "
"3812290","3814550"," Look at, look at the mag seven right right in there."
"3815130","3815610"," Right."
"3815650","3817730"," Look at that almost exactly down here. "
"3817890","3823790"," And you're going to be looking for that dip by down into the 200 and 43rd or whatever."
"3824350","3831850"," So if you're going to get a, if you're going to get a, a true holiday rally should be starting"
"3831850","3835030"," near the end of the year."
"3835670","3838670"," Traditionally, now I know this year is special because we got a rate decision. "
"3839290","3841690"," But just remember that if you do get that holiday rally."
"3842450","3843350"," That's end of year."
"3843530","3848850"," Also remember, if we get no rate increase, you should see an out performance. "
"3849750","3853370"," See how on tech, we get no $1 in four week bills."
"3853830","3858410"," Prior high yield of five spot, two, nine percent and a private cover of two spots, seven, five."
"3859370","3861030"," I want to show you this right here. "
"3861030","3864750"," See the under performance from tech in the beginning of the year, right?"
"3866150","3871270"," Now, I don't have the seasonality chart in front of me for IWM, but I have posted it on Fintuit."
"3871690","3874470"," You should see an out performance from IWM."
"3874830","3880370"," IWM for the, for January should look like this or even like this into March. "
"3881010","3886130"," If we don't get a rate hike this cycle, you'd see the out performance."
"3886630","3887070"," SPX."
"3888470","3889870"," You get the out performance. "
"3891590","3892030"," Nope."
"3892270","3892750"," It's okay."
"3892870","3893170"," It's good. "
"3893530","3898030"," You get that Santa rally or whatever you want to call it holiday rally into the beginning of the"
"3898030","3898270"," year."
"3898650","3900150"," It's not out performance though."
"3900290","3904010"," So it should be good, but it shouldn't be out perform. "
"3905030","3907210"," So what can we glean from all of this?"
"3909270","3918410"," If we roll into the rate decision and you do not see Jerome Powell, raise rates."
"3919730","3926030"," And you had to make a decision of what you were going to long into March."
"3927790","3930690"," You're going to sit there with your hand on the buy button. "
"3931050","3935750"," You don't have to maybe you don't have to slam it immediately, but if you hear him say anything."
"3937410","3939290"," Like no rate increase."
"3941430","3944750"," But he warns you he's going to rate increase in three months. "
"3945790","3946510"," He's lying."
"3949230","3956090"," Historically, if we do not get a rate increase in this decision, he's lying."
"3957590","3962030"," And even if he does raise against again, it won't matter. "
"3962630","3964150"," I'm going to tell you why it won't matter."
"3964150","3967710"," The market will in turn will not believe him."
"3968110","3974210"," And they will ramp the fuck out of small caps likely into March 31st. "
"3974690","3980770"," So you have your you have your by hammer ready to rock on Wednesday's decision."
"3982350","3983550"," You get what I'm saying?"
"3983790","3993210"," Now if he does raise rates on Tuesday, even 25 BPS, you could see an initial bearish reaction in"
"3993210","3993790"," the markets."
"3994230","3997630"," I would expect no outperformance by small caps. "
"3998390","4003770"," You will likely see weakness in the market, but you'll get a Christmas Santa rally holiday rally."
"4003950","4006110"," It just won't outperform."
"4007190","4014610"," If you get a 25 BPS rate increase, the only reason he's doing it is to give himself an extension"
"4015530","4019730"," from the market pricing in no more rate hikes. "
"4020290","4020810"," Okay."
"4021270","4027410"," So if you see 25 BPS, he might be doing he might do that just to buy himself time from"
"4027410","4036450"," what will likely trigger the markets moving in this anticipation of rate cuts into the end of 24."
"4037710","4040070"," We've gone over that ad nauseam at this point. "
"4040210","4045230"," So you'd be prepared for that as we head into that that Jerome Powell presser next week."
"4045650","4048130"," So if you're looking for a Santa rally, right?"
"4048130","4055050"," You'll get under performance heading into next week for the new year."
"4055570","4059670"," If you get a rate pause, you're going to see out performance by IWM. "
"4061550","4063390"," And what else do I have to say to you?"
"4063670","4063950"," I don't know."
"4063990","4064490"," I think that's it."
"4065690","4068550"," I'm going to tell you secretly, I think we're getting 25 BPS. "
"4068850","4072230"," But if he does that, he is likely sealed the deal on a recession."
"4073610","4076270"," So you then short oil and shit like that."
"4076270","4078710"," You'd be taking like oil down a fucking $62. "
"4079230","4080890"," The world would panic over that."
"4082190","4087010"," So I don't, I mean, I guess that's the only thing I can think of why he would raise 25"
"4087010","4092490"," BPS would be to give him some five or six months of time before he has to make another decision."
"4093330","4098430"," If he did give you 25 BPS, also I would not expect another rate increase for five months. "
"4099430","4102529"," He will stretch that fucker out as long as he possibly can."
"4114670","4123870"," Yeah, FinTwit is a group of trainers, a group of bad ass motherfuckers that hang out on Twitter."
"4125090","4128250"," FinTwit, FinTwit's a group of trainers. "
"4128810","4134010"," Those guys go all the way back to like the old old old old old message boards when the internet"
"4134010","4134790"," was first invented."
"4136710","4142569"," Old old school, bunch of old fucks that have been around, hanging slumming around for decades."
"4148720","4151899"," Yeah, they're, I mean, we watch this shit, right?"
"4152000","4153779"," We watch the unemployment just creeping up. "
"4153819","4158000"," We know that it's going to hit that, it's going to hit like six percent in December, right?"
"4158660","4159560"," You know they're going to panic."
"4159660","4161939"," It's our cutting fucking rates, right?"
"4162840","4166880"," You know that you're going to get a bounce down on inflation, a fake ass bounce, right?"
"4168540","4170660"," You guys know what the mechanics of this is?"
"4170899","4171840"," I'll tell you what the mechanics are."
"4172399","4175760"," The fucking employment is going to ramp up into December of 2024, okay?"
"4176800","4183920"," You're going to see inflation bullshit scam inflation print of the two percent, two point one, two"
"4183920","4184460"," point two. "
"4185160","4190600"," As we ramp up into that six percent, you're going to see wages increase."
"4190600","4194980"," They're going to declare victory, but it's a fake."
"4196240","4201900"," Your prices aren't coming down, your wages are going to increase, and we're going to, we're going"
"4201900","4205400"," to carry on as we always have since 1978 ish. "
"4206420","4207540"," That's what's going to happen."
"4208280","4212300"," Whether you like that or not, whether you agree with that or not, it's going to be the fraud"
"4212300","4217200"," continues until they, what, until the fraud becomes public, right?"
"4218620","4222160"," Until that happens, they're, they're right now trying to manufacture."
"4223740","4226060"," They say they haven't never done this work. "
"4226380","4231260"," I tend to somewhat agree with this, but it's still the same fucking scam."
"4232520","4234660"," Trade the market sideways by time."
"4235800","4242040"," You become, you accept fucking five guys burgers being fucking $30 meal. "
"4242920","4245340"," They slowly try to pay you more money over time."
"4245340","4249500"," A lot of workers, they won't, they'll try to squeeze them, keep a bunch of money as back as"
"4249500","4250340"," profitable as possible."
"4251900","4255280"," So something like that, some kind of like that scenario is, looks like what's playing out. "
"4255500","4259480"," And we've been talking about that fucking scenario for goddamn two years around here, haven't we?"
"4259820","4261780"," Talking about that scenario for two, three years around here."
"4262660","4264040"," It's going that way right now."
"4264040","4268040"," High yield, five spot, two, eight, five percent, five spot, two, eight, five percent for a bit, the"
"4268040","4271040"," cover of three spot to zero, eight, three spots, zero, eight. "
"4271060","4271520"," Look at Juicy here."
"4271700","4273400"," So the guys don't see this being Juicy here."
"4273660","4273980"," Eighties. "
"4274160","4275200"," Juicy as fuck to me."
"4275420","4278000"," And awards for spot two, four percent of bits at high."
"4283490","4288290"," So nice looking dip by right here you got half hour trigger crossing the hourly trigger. "
"4288870","4292290"," You've got a back test of the five and the hour going on right now."
"4293130","4293930"," Out of the way."
"4305050","4306970"," Okay, so I got to go to these meetings. "
"4307510","4311690"," I'll be back with you guys saying major, any major shift changes, anything like that."
"4312010","4313650"," Any kind of paranoia that."
"4313970","4317890"," Remember, this today is different than yesterday, right?"
"4318930","4323670"," We were trying to fight up into the hourly trigger, right?"
"4324330","4326230"," As the hourly trigger was coming down. "
"4326230","4329510"," The hourly trigger is going up right now, right?"
"4329890","4330790"," It's going up right now."
"4331070","4332390"," We're coming back to back check it."
"4333530","4335790"," Your thesis is with the bulls right now. "
"4335790","4336430"," Not with the bears."
"4337490","4339070"," Makes sense yesterday was different, right?"
"4339430","4341130"," Remember yesterday I was like, don't be buying this here."
"4341170","4342930"," Well, not dope, but you can trade this. "
"4343250","4344530"," But it's very dangerous here."
"4344830","4346070"," This is where the sellers are."
"4346510","4347750"," This is not where the sellers are. "
"4347830","4348810"," This is where the buyers are."
"4348930","4350230"," This is the inverse of yesterday."
"4353210","4355430"," All right, I'll see you guys soon. "
"4356430","4357890"," Leave that right there for you."
"4364490","4365490"," Paul's deep in calls."
"4366030","4372090"," All right, I'll talk to you guys soon. "
"4427830","4431510"," At the top of the market right now, Walgreens at the top of the market, both of those have been"
"4431510","4432930"," big laggards this year."
"4432930","4436730"," Yeah, it's been a theme for a couple of weeks, although as Bob says today, the index is moving on"
"4436730","4437230"," the big names."
"4437230","4441070"," But yeah, you figure the tax law selling is done and people can wait back in. "
"4441210","4444730"," That and alphabet and AMD having a little AI runner right now."
"4445090","4450130"," Let's turn to China, mixed trade data coming in overnight, despite a surprise beat for exports,"
"4450810","4453690"," imports fell, missing estimates as China's economy slows."
"4454210","4459390"," The lower growth prompting Moody's earlier this week to downgrade the country's A1 debt rating to"
"4459390","4459770"," negative. "
"4460050","4465030"," Our next guest is looking at foreign flows to the US treasuries as an indicator, noting that"
"4465030","4470830"," China's holdings of US bonds has dropped 300 billions since 2021, and as the world's second biggest"
"4470830","4473450"," economy falters, demand will likely remain weak."
"4474150","4478130"," Joining us now, Apollo Global Management's Chief Economist, Torsten Slock, this has been going on"
"4478130","4483450"," now for a while, Torsten, where China has been unloading treasuries."
"4483590","4484590"," You expect the trend to continue?"
"4485470","4491530"," Yeah, so the backdrop is exactly as you're saying that Chinese exports have been slowing down, and"
"4491530","4493110"," why have exports been slowing down?"
"4493470","4496910"," Well, partly because the US has been slowing down and Europe has been slowing down. "
"4497330","4503250"," So if your exports slow down, that also means that China has fewer dollars to recycle into"
"4503250","4503730"," treasuries."
"4504270","4509110"," So if China has less exports, that also means that they therefore get less dollars in their hands"
"4509110","4514510"," to recycle it back into global markets, and that does mean, therefore, as you just showed in the"
"4514510","4519790"," chart to that point, that there is likely to continue to be less demand for US treasuries from"
"4519790","4520850"," China from that front."
"4521810","4526570"," So do you think it's something that the market appreciates?"
"4526730","4528270"," Do you think it's factored in?"
"4528690","4531490"," How does it move the treasury market on a day-to-day basis?"
"4531730","4537370"," Because when there was a big fell off a few months ago, you just added it to the list, China's"
"4537370","4539830"," unloading treasuries, and then there's not going to be as much demand. "
"4540110","4543990"," But now there's been a pretty furious rally here, and people aren't worried as much about it."
"4544710","4545950"," Yeah, no, this is very important."
"4546130","4549530"," So there is a list, so if you just back up a little bit and ask what's driving rates, it's"
"4549530","4555310"," very clear that the economic data, expectations to the Fed, everything that's going on on short"
"4555310","4558210"," rates is absolutely a key driver of long rates. "
"4558590","4562470"," But exactly, as you just mentioned, Sarah, we have also had a number of other things that continue"
"4562470","4564690"," to be still lingering a bit in the background."
"4564830","4569950"," Not only is China slowing down, and therefore exports slowing, and therefore less demand for"
"4569950","4573990"," treasuries from China, but we also have that Japan is exiting yield control."
"4574390","4576090"," That'd be Japanese yields have been going up. "
"4576090","4580490"," Remember, Japanese investors hold more than a trillion US treasuries, so if Japanese investors find"
"4580490","4586210"," their own yields and their own back out more attractive, that's certainly also a risk for US rates"
"4586210","4589050"," moving higher, as Japanese investors begin to take more money home."
"4589490","4595050"," And finally, the biggest risk really is still the supply of treasuries and the supply from the"
"4595050","4598250"," fiscal deficit front that continues to be a lingering issue in the background."
"4598550","4599150"," So yes, you're right. "
"4599530","4604550"," So far, the rally we've seen in rates in the long end has been driven almost entirely by the idea"
"4604550","4609410"," that the feds may be done, and I agree with that, and therefore maybe short rates should be going"
"4609410","4609650"," down."
"4610110","4614230"," But these other issues, again, remember, it's not only more more than a few weeks ago, we had a 30 "
"4614230","4618810","-year auction that didn't go out very well because we simply did not have enough demand."
"4619350","4623950"," We have plenty of 10-year and 30-year auctions going into next year where the market will be"
"4623950","4628710"," revisiting exactly the issue whether what are these other things implying for rates. "
"4628910","4633510"," So the bottom line is, yes, so far so good, but the risk is still that long rates will be"
"4633510","4638150"," having some upside pressures coming from these other sources, namely China's lowing, Japan's exit"
"4638150","4641030"," of yield control, and the significant supply of treasuries in the pipeline."
"4641690","4645910"," Yeah, we have some auctions even next week, I think, on the longer end of the curve-torsing."
"4646790","4652470"," But I guess the question is, does the rally that we've seen so far not somewhat dilute the idea"
"4652470","4654250"," that this was mostly a supply shock?"
"4654510","4659810"," Really, if you pull back, is there anything particularly strange, about a 4% to 5% 10-year treasury"
"4659810","4665170"," yield, given where nominal GDP growth is and given where inflation still is?"
"4666170","4670790"," That's a very important point, Mike, but you're right that maybe we did go up too much when 10-year"
"4670790","4671770"," rates hit 5%. "
"4672170","4675290"," The big question is, where are we going on short rates?"
"4675870","4679850"," If short rates are going down to the Fed is predicting over the next several years, down to 2.5,"
"4680250","4684750"," well then maybe 10-year rates, if you think the term premium or the risk that you have paid for"
"4684750","4686850"," taking more duration should be roughly a half."
"4686850","4690350"," That means that 10-year rates should go down to three, three-and-a-half."
"4690890","4695130"," So in that sense, we have unwound a lot of the increase in rates that we had. "
"4695330","4697470"," So you're right, so far so good."
"4697630","4700830"," It does look like it's made it driven by Fed expectations and the economy."
"4701110","4703070"," But let's see these other things. "
"4703290","4705030"," They definitely come and go."
"4705270","4709870"," And in particular, this issue of auctions, as you're saying, even next week, we got to continue"
"4709870","4714570"," watching very carefully what's happening to the bid-to-cover ratio in long-duration options, what's"
"4714570","4717630"," happening to foreign bidding, how much the primary dealers have to take down."
"4717930","4722290"," All those things will just continue to intensify because we have no one thing for sure, and that is"
"4722290","4725290"," that a supply issue for treasuries is not going to go away. "
"4725510","4729310"," It's just only going to continue to get bigger and bigger as we go through the coming months."
"4729790","4732550"," All right, so we will watch demand as always."
"4732750","4733750"," Torshan, thank you very much. "
"4734130","4734750"," Good to talk to you."
"4734910","4735410"," Torshan Slott."
"4735550","4735770"," Thank you. "
"4735910","4736650"," Apollo Chief Economist."
"4738150","4742370"," All right, after the break, a short move higher for Alphabet after yesterday's AI announcement."
"4742370","4744870"," The shares on pace for the best day since July. "
"4745270","4747790"," Up more than 5% will break down why Wall Street is so bold."
"4748270","4753150"," Plus, never in our wildest dreams did we think that a pop star would alter the economics of the"
"4753150","4755770"," country with a cardigan, a cool summer, and karma."
"4756630","4759510"," I think that's four different song lyrics incorporated into that too. "
"4759750","4761810"," We're talking Swift economics straight ahead."
"4946890","4951130"," Taylor Swift just named Time's Person of the Year, but she's more than just a pop icon."
"4951130","4952890"," She's a business powerhouse. "
"4953550","4957450"," Julia Borsten with us at Post 9 to break down some of the Swift economics."
"4957750","4961570"," Something we've known for a while, but you looked into the numbers and they're pretty amazing."
"4962070","4965350"," Yes, I'm so excited to be here to talk about this with you because I know you and I have"
"4965350","4969130"," been really interested in the business implications of Taylor Swift for quite some time. "
"4969390","4975930"," So Taylor Swift's economic impact is far more than her concerts, $2.2 billion in North American"
"4975930","4976550"," ticket sales."
"4976550","4982350"," Her tour is estimated to have generated $5 billion in consumer spending in the U.S. alone."
"4982850","4988530"," Then there's the concert film, which AMC distributed, grossing a record $250 million at the Global"
"4988530","4989230"," Box Office. "
"4989710","4994670"," And then next Wednesday, her birthday, she's offering the movie for rent on a range of streaming"
"4994670","4995150"," platforms."
"4995770","5002350"," Now, when it comes to streaming music, she was Spotify's top streamed artist of the year with 26.1"
"5002350","5007090"," billion global streams, reportedly earning her over $100 million in royalties."
"5007890","5012170"," And Billboard estimates that her streaming revenue, including other platforms, will near $200"
"5012170","5012810"," million. "
"5013510","5017010"," And that's partially driven by her re-recording her albums."
"5017670","5020070"," Now, Swift's popularity also boosts the economy."
"5020070","5022870"," In many ways, she does not profit from. "
"5023390","5029330"," Etsy tells us that since April, Etsy sellers have sold nearly $5.5 million in friendship bracelets"
"5029330","5032410"," that's a growth of 30 percent on a year-over-year basis."
"5033030","5037570"," And Michaels tells us that sales in their jewelry category, including jewelry making kits, search"
"5037570","5042970"," 40 percent since mid-April, when the Swift friendship bracelet making trend really took off."
"5043350","5049210"," Now, with City's where she was on tour, they saw a 300 percent sales lift in the likes of beads"
"5049210","5050310"," and jewelry from Michaels. "

"5076630","5080610"," to the NFL, thanks to her relationship with Travis Kelsey."
"5080970","5082630"," It is mind-boggling."
"5082630","5088730"," And I feel like she gets, she obviously gets a lot of credit for just being a phenomenon and a"
"5088730","5092610"," pop icon and writing her own music and having songs and that people can all relate to. "
"5092730","5097110"," I don't think she gets enough credit for being such an innovator with some of these business"
"5097110","5102910"," decisions, re-recording the album, doing a three-hour tour, you know, for eras and just making all"
"5102910","5107870"," the right decisions about where to take that, extending it for another year."
"5107870","5112650"," You know, some of these things that actually CEOs and other leaders we talked to could probably"
"5112650","5113250"," learn from."
"5113370","5119250"," And also the decision to release her concert tour as a movie and this idea of how to expand the"
"5119250","5124210"," audience as much as possible and then give her fans multiple touch points where a lot of people who"
"5124210","5129370"," paid a lot of money to go see the concert and to get all the help to see the concert"
"5129370","5134370"," are then also paying money to see it in theaters and then also I'm sure we'll rent it at home. "
"5134370","5138970"," Now, as an underwriter of a field trip to a different city from my teenage owners to go see it,"
"5139050","5139950"," I feel all of it."
"5140170","5142550"," What is interesting is what the impact is going to be next year."
"5142690","5146450"," We're going to presumably she's not going to do another tour, it's not going to be the exact. "
"5146690","5148070"," She's an international engineer."
"5148610","5149670"," Exactly, so it's international."
"5151070","5156010"," You heard about people opening up, the number of people opened up a credit card account, but the"
"5156010","5159310"," purpose of buying tickets, of course she has a relationship with Capital One, was phenomenal. "
"5159770","5161510"," And so it's actually moved the needle on a lot of these."
"5161510","5164590"," And I actually heard of a number of people, you said you're going to see her in London, a number"
"5164590","5171250"," of people who are planning summer vacations around a stop to see her in an international city."
"5172710","5173610"," It is amazing. "
"5174390","5176170"," And you're part of it, you're part of that $10 billion."
"5176890","5178270"," I'm a big part, I just looked up the hotel box."
"5179810","5182230"," Well, yeah, I mean it's paying up. "
"5182550","5186630"," I think it's definitely, I think it's something the Fed has mentioned before in terms of the"
"5186630","5187270"," Facebook at least."
"5188110","5188630"," Julia, thank you."
"5188630","5189530"," It's great to be here. "
"5189690","5191110"," For the story, we all want it."
"5191610","5197210"," Speaking of disruptors, CNBC is accepting nominations for the 12th annual disruptor 50 list of"
"5197210","5198910"," private venture backed companies."
"5199350","5203350"," To learn more, just scan the QR code right there on your screen or go to CNBC.com."
"5204770","5205650"," Black disruptors. "
"5205970","5208030"," We'll be all over it."
"5208030","5210830"," All right, here's about 5%."
"5210830","5215690"," That was a delayed reaction to their launch of the AI model Gemini yesterday. "
"5216670","5218530"," Talked about it yesterday, has more today's tech check."
"5219390","5222870"," Mike, I've been trying to figure out how I was going to follow some dynamics."
"5223290","5223990"," But here we are here. "
"5224510","5227370"," Gemini, I would argue, it's quite mind boggling as well."
"5228010","5229970"," Yesterday the announcement, it did fly under the radar."
"5230310","5231330"," Part because it was subdued. "
"5232350","5235170"," Virtual presentation versus an in-person launch."
"5235910","5236870"," It's going to roll out in phases."
"5237310","5240630"," And it's really hard to get across just how incredible this technology is. "
"5240630","5244890"," It's a written piece because the breakthrough is in a word and you're going to hear this more"
"5244890","5245130"," often."
"5245350","5250590"," Multi-modal, meaning that the new AI system understands audio, photos, video."
"5250970","5252750"," And luckily we operate in the world of TV. "
"5252990","5257970"," So we have the advantage of showing our audience and investors the new capabilities as presented by"
"5257970","5258810"," Google in a demo."
"5259030","5259290"," Have a look."
"5264280","5265320"," I know what you're doing. "
"5265740","5267260"," You're playing rock, paper, scissors."
"5268380","5269500"," What do you see now?"
"5269500","5272680"," The fingers are spread out to look like the wings of a butterfly."
"5273500","5274020"," What's this?"
"5274640","5276760"," Big ear and barking mouth, a dog. "
"5278620","5280080"," Now here's another example."
"5282780","5284680"," What movie are they acting out here?"
"5285320","5288260"," I think they are acting out the famous bullet time scene from the Matrix."
"5289980","5295500"," Now I don't know if I could guess that as quickly as Gemini did, but guys I highly recommend the"
"5295500","5298020"," entire six minute video if you haven't already watched it. "
"5298020","5303620"," Other examples include Gemini understanding colors, 3D objects, creating games, even cracking"
"5303620","5304040"," jokes."
"5304580","5308920"," The version demo though won't be available until next year, but what it all represents is a new"
"5308920","5311720"," more powerful phase of generative AI."
"5312040","5316740"," Chat GPT was again first year in terms of going beyond text and incorporating sound and video. "
"5317400","5318600"," Gemini is Google answering back."
"5318960","5323860"," Now as part of CNBC's work summit, I talked to Marty Shava, six three partners, Vice Chairman."
"5323860","5328940"," He's been studying AI since the late 80s and says that there's never been a more exciting time. "
"5330680","5336020"," We're well into the second half of the chess board and computers just keep getting faster and"
"5336020","5338980"," there's more and more data and the data has been labeled."
"5339620","5340900"," The Internet has helped do that."
"5341420","5345820"," And all of these things have come together with more theoretical breakthroughs. "
"5345980","5351540"," Everything that I see is about twice as impressive as what I saw three months before."
"5352340","5358800"," And I think that's how Google's Gemini demonstration made a lot of folks feel once they got a"
"5358800","5359900"," chance to watch it."
"5360020","5365020"," And so that reaction was a little delayed, but today the stock is surging up more than 5%. "
"5365020","5370520"," And Google has perhaps just regained an edge in the AI arms race that is still well underway."
"5371040","5376780"," And you know, yesterday, guys, I was thinking maybe the AI halo effect has lost some of its glean"
"5376780","5381860"," because the stock wasn't moving much, but today is sort of evidence that we can still get wowed"
"5381860","5382100"," here."
"5382300","5383940"," And I think many more of those moments are going to come. "
"5384520","5385080"," It's interesting."
"5385480","5390640"," Also a reminder that if you go back far enough and talk about how Microsoft was approaching this"
"5390640","5395960"," world before we had chat GPT really in place, they feared that Google would have a huge advantage"
"5395960","5399980"," just because they have all the data and all the history in their search business."
"5400140","5402860"," So this maybe is an affirmation that they do have those resources. "
"5403260","5405900"," I guess the other question is, look, Microsoft stock's not down today."
"5405900","5410260"," I don't think the market's necessarily viewing it as, oh, here's a killer app that all of a sudden"
"5410260","5411840"," is going to be a winner take most solution."
"5412660","5413900"," Yeah, and I think that's right. "
"5414000","5418140"," And I think the question is starting to be asked, you know, will these chat bots, is this"
"5418140","5422100"," technology which requires so much money in terms of compute power."
"5422320","5424860"," Now, is that eventually going to be commoditized?"
"5425080","5430440"," I had a conversation recently here in Silicon Valley about what Apple's doing, right?"
"5430440","5433560"," They're not mentioned in this race."
"5433860","5438160"," It's sort of a race between Microsoft and open AI, Google and Amazon. "
"5438680","5443000"," You don't talk about Apple, but I think nobody, there's few people doubt that Apple is thinking"
"5443000","5443600"," about this."
"5443760","5445460"," They tend to wait a little bit."
"5445580","5450360"," Maybe when this is all commoditized, they can swoop in and do something really interesting, but we"
"5450360","5451700"," are just in the early stages. "
"5452100","5457900"," And right now at least investors, developers, they're looking for the kind of thing that Google put"
"5457900","5459620"," out yesterday with Gemini."
"5459620","5461060"," More and more capabilities."
"5461720","5464740"," We still don't really know what apps are going to be created from that, though. "
"5465080","5465960"," No, not at all."
"5466240","5467120"," I'm moving pretty fast."
"5467360","5468300"," D, thanks very much. "
"5469360","5475020"," Up next, why value investors at the Oakmark Fund say Cortiva is the perfect example of a stock"
"5475020","5476780"," that's been left behind in this year's rally."
"5477140","5478780"," We'll trade that name and more."
"5666710","5669110"," Just heads up for 58 C's. "
"5669250","5675430"," They were trading 30 cents when we talked earlier and I said that's bullish reversal up 100% in"
"5675430","5676130"," that trade right now."
"5685740","5687800"," Let's close out the hour with some stock picks."
"5687960","5693020"," Our next guest is still finding cheap quality names despite the market trading at high multiples"
"5693020","5699420"," right now, outlining some new ideas heading into 2024, including Phillips 66 in energy and Cortiva"
"5699420","5700060"," in agriculture. "
"5700680","5704900"," Joining us now, Mike Nicholas, portfolio manager for the Oakmark Fund."
"5704900","5706200"," Mike, it's good to have you here."
"5706320","5708820"," You guys look company by company, stock by stock. "
"5709040","5710760"," Don't necessarily make market calls."
"5710920","5715360"," What's taking you in the direction of, let's say, a Phillips 66 right now."
"5716060","5718240"," Well, Mike, first, thanks for having me. "
"5719260","5725180"," We're continuing to find really attractive opportunities in traditional value stocks, really some"
"5725180","5726040"," out of favor businesses."
"5726680","5731860"," And when there's as much dispersion as there is in the market right now, it really provides a lot"
"5731860","5734140"," of opportunities for us to find mispriced securities."
"5734140","5740180"," And, you know, we think companies like Phillips and 66 both look really attractive, very"
"5740180","5743500"," statistically cheap businesses, strong competitive positions. "
"5744180","5748680"," And, you know, we expect both businesses to grow per share value, at least as fast"
"5748680","5763880"," as"
"5763880","5764120"," the market."
"5764740","5767000"," Well, the shares have been quite weak this year."
"5767140","5772220"," You know, Cortiva is a leading provider of seeds and crop protection chemicals to the agricultural"
"5772220","5773080"," industry. "
"5773420","5777460"," And, you know, both end markets require a tremendous amount of innovation."
"5777840","5783000"," You know, farmers expect seed yield improvement every year and nature develops immunity to crop"
"5783000","5784580"," protection chemicals over time."
"5785300","5789760"," And as a result, you know, the skilled players in this industry have tremendous advantage. "
"5789760","5793740"," And against that backdrop, we think Cortiva is really, really well positioned."
"5794420","5799980"," They've got strong brands and a very loyal customer base, a very promising R&D pipeline."
"5801000","5802660"," But the shares have been pressured this year. "
"5802740","5806320"," I think it's a combination of channel de-stocking and weak crop prices."
"5807360","5809980"," And to us, we view those both as transitory."
"5809980","5815760"," And it's really afforded us the opportunity to invest in a high-quality, defensible business at a"
"5815760","5817820"," big discount to the market. "
"5817820","5822840"," It's own historical trading multiple and certainly private market values like Monsanto and"
"5822840","5823360"," Syngenta."
"5824000","5827120"," Phillips 66, of course, had activist interest."
"5827420","5831740"," There is a billion-dollar investment by Elliot, and you're advocating for some management and"
"5831740","5832740"," strategic changes. "
"5833000","5836160"," Is that part of the idea in terms of your long holding there?"
"5837280","5838480"," You know, ours is a little different."
"5838900","5843940"," Phillips 66 is the largest mid and downstream energy company in America."
"5843940","5849780"," And, you know, Phillips was a part of Conoco until 2012 when it spun off, which is another"
"5849780","5851060"," portfolio holding of ours. "
"5851920","5857400"," And, you know, our view on Phillips 66 is that while it's typically perceived as a pure player"
"5857400","5864120"," refiner, the vast majority of its business value resides in its non-refining assets based on our"
"5864120","5864580"," analysis."
"5864580","5870260"," And that includes things like its big collection of pipelines and storage terminals, its chemical"
"5870260","5875240"," manufacturing facilities, its retail fueling stations, and, you know, our some of the parts"
"5875240","5881800"," analysis suggest that these non-refining assets alone justify today's enterprise value, that we're"
"5881800","5883640"," getting the refining operations for free."
"5884220","5890360"," So we, you know, we think there's a tremendous amount of upside potential here, and on our estimate"
"5890360","5896060"," of normal earnings, the stock is trading at just, you know, a single-digit multiple and well below"
"5896060","5896860"," intrinsic value. "
"5896860","5902500"," So, for a collection of mission-critical infrastructure-oriented assets, it would be very"
"5902500","5903940"," challenging and expensive to recreate."
"5904540","5904640"," Right."
"5905020","5906520"," We think today's value is a bargain. "
"5906860","5911120"," Yeah, see if it can get unlocked one way or another of that value."
"5911360","5912040"," Mike, thanks a lot."
"5912100","5913160"," Greg, to talk to you today, Mike. "
"5913300","5914460"," Mike, thanks for having me."
"5914560","5917180"," We're having a pretty broad rally again today, Mike."
"5917540","5917720"," Yeah, picked up. "
"5918000","5920700"," Quietly, most sectors are up except for health care."
"5921440","5923860"," Right now, S&P is now up three quarters of one percent."
"5923860","5925820"," And that's like one and a quarter percent. "
"5926000","5930240"," So you're getting a real lift from names like AMD and Alphabet of some new AI."
"5930720","5934860"," Amazon also pumping higher as well as some positive comments, of course, last night from Andy"
"5934860","5935240"," Jassy."
"5935520","5937640"," Even though the rally's taking a bit of a pause in treasuries. "
"5938060","5939640"," Yeah, it's just sort of hanging out there."
"5939720","5943520"," It feels like under four and a quarter on the ten years a comfortable place for the market to try"
"5943520","5943720"," to rally."
"5943840","5947880"," But I will point out, we've closed within a half a percent of 45-50 in the S&P for"
"5947880","5949380"," like 12 or 13 days in a row. "
"5949740","5950960"," There's a chance we get above it here."
"5950960","5952800"," We'll see if it will break out."
"5952920","5953900"," We have a jobs report tomorrow. "
"5954060","5957640"," I said I think the bias feels like maybe a weak number with the rally in treasuries."
"5958500","5959600"," But that's it for us for now."
"5959840","5960220"," We'll see you tomorrow. "
"5960520","5961680"," Scott, in the Halftime Report."
"5962160","5962420"," Up now."
"5964640","5965800"," All right, Sarah, thanks so much. "
"5965920","5966960"," Welcome to the Halftime Report."
"5966960","5968660"," I'm Scott Walker, front and center this Saturday."
"5968960","5972140"," The AI Wars, Alphabet, firing its latest salvo today. "
"5972540","5974760"," That stock surging as we come on the air."
"5975260","5979120"," We'll discuss and debate with the Investment Committee what all of it means to your money joining"
"5979120","5979820"," me for the hour."
"5979820","5982080"," Bring talking to Josh Brown, Bill Baruch. "
"5982340","5983420"," Let's go to the markets."
"5983680","5984780"," We are green across the board."
"5985320","5988100"," Dows have a nice bounce today of some 53 points. "
"5988260","5990420"," It is the Nasdaq where the story is today, though."
"5990620","5991360"," One and a quarter percent."
"5991500","5992720"," You heard Sarah talking about that. "
"5993020","5995540"," For 12, the yield on the ten year note."
"5995660","5996680"," But Josh, I turn to you first."
"5997360","5998520"," Alphabet's our chart of the day. "
"5999520","6001440"," Because it has its Gemini."
"6001860","6004400"," Okay, so this competition with Microsoft is ramping up."
"6004900","6008300"," Barron's today says, quote, Google got its AI launch right this time. "
"6008300","6009340"," This is your stock."
"6009860","6010320"," Yeah."
"6010420","6010900"," This is your bet. "
"6011120","6012500"," Yo, how mad is Brad today?"
"6012980","6014240"," Should I text Brad on the break?"
"6014500","6015520"," Make sure he was watching this."
"6015880","6018760"," It's not a victory lap."
"6019020","6025160"," I just have always believed that first is not the thing with AI because it never has been with any"
"6025160","6027360"," previous technological revolution. "
"6028320","6031740"," Ironically, we're like saying, oh, Google's late, blah, blah, blah."
"6032120","6036620"," Google came like six years late to the search engine party."
"6036620","6041140"," Let's all remember that Google came public in 2004. "
"6041780","6048360"," We had a whole wave of, quote, unquote, dominant search engines that came and went before they even"
"6048360","6049200"," got onto the runway."
"6049680","6055820"," So it was way too early to declare that Alphabet's offering in AI was going to be DOA."
"6056100","6061340"," One of the things I've been saying since the spring, there is no future of computing that Google"
"6061340","6063040"," doesn't play a pivotal role in. "
"6063040","6069480"," And by the way, not only are they not late to AI, they actually were before Microsoft in building"
"6069480","6070180"," it internally."
"6070780","6071760"," They just went slower."
"6072640","6072980"," Deep brain. "
"6073680","6077320"," I mean, we're talking about 10 year efforts in AI internally."
"6077620","6077920"," Deep mind."
"6078120","6078620"," Deep mind. "
"6078940","6079660"," Google brain."
"6080260","6082480"," They've had AI in the work."
"6082700","6085120"," So now they got the memo they're catching up. "
"6085300","6087600"," You can see in the stock price, people like the rollout."
"6088340","6091280"," It doesn't mean they're going to dominate the business the way they've dominated search."
"6091280","6093760"," Brad Gerstner is right about that. "
"6094120","6098480"," I just don't think that the domination is the important thing to investors right now."
"6098520","6099660"," So this is going to run on everything."
"6099800","6102320"," Speaking of Gemini, of course, Bill, you own the stock too. "
"6102420","6106240"," It's going to run on everything from data centers to mobile reiterated by today."
"6106420","6110900"," Bank of America reiterated overweight JP Morgan reiterated overweight at key bank glowing"
"6110900","6114600"," commentary from the analyst community today as a result of all this."
"6114600","6117640"," And the stock, as we said, is having its best percentage gained since the summer. "
"6117640","6118120"," Yeah."
"6118520","6123940"," Yeah, you know, I think the really interesting thing here is 20 multiple for this name because of"
"6123940","6125100"," concern about search."
"6125540","6127240"," And I think this could really reaffirm search. "
"6127740","6129440"," The search is going to be AI driven."
"6129640","6130960"," I've seen some of this Jim and I stuff in work."
"6131060","6132620"," I mean, it's phenomenal. "
"6133220","6137160"," And for us, we wait alphabet more than Microsoft in our portfolio."
"6138160","6143140"," Ultimately, because we thought that the AI that alphabet could provide or could hit on here was"
"6143140","6143900"," underappreciated."
"6143960","6145220"," And now we're seeing it. "
"6145220","6146900"," Yeah, you don't know."
"6147220","6149040"," I don't you don't know either of these stocks."
"6149260","6149440"," Do you?"
"6149840","6150880"," Are you on Microsoft?"
"6151060","6151900"," You're on Microsoft. "
"6151900","6153420"," So I mean, you have a dog in the fight."
"6154120","6160460"," But did you feel like alphabet has closed a little bit of the gap, whether it was perceived or"
"6160460","6160720"," otherwise?"
"6162580","6164860"," They closed like a sentiment gap, right?"
"6165080","6168000"," So we all saw Jim and I can say, yeah, and orange is healthier than a cookie."
"6168440","6173600"," And so we all need to see the tangibles that of what they're doing at deep minds, which we Josh"
"6173600","6174540"," is so spot on. "
"6174980","6177040"," Deep minds is an incredible company."
"6177220","6178620"," They bought Google bottle on time ago."
"6179080","6182300"," I think ultimately it's like, there is going to be multiple winners. "
"6182700","6186960"," And this year is going to remind everybody this was the year of the return of the mega caps."
"6187380","6192160"," And when you look forward to 2024, what sector is supposed to have the highest growth?"
"6193080","6193520"," Technology."
"6194320","6198820"," And so I think that although we've had a wonderful year, the last two years, I don't think Google"
"6198820","6200260"," is above that two year high. "
"6200260","6201580"," Only Microsoft and Apple."
"6201860","6206720"," So it'll be interesting to see if we can see continued multiple expansion and move past that two"
"6206720","6211060"," year high that most of these names have not breached outside of Microsoft and Apple."
"6211420","6213000"," It's crazy when you look at the. "
"6213700","6216960"," I know that we all know that mega cap has led."
"6217560","6220160"," And to the degree which it has."
"6220840","6227400"," It's nonetheless crazy when you look at the 12 month returns for these stocks that Microsoft's up"
"6227400","6228060"," 50%. "
"6228060","6231320"," Now, I know the stocks got hammered a lot in 2022."
"6232020","6233680"," That alphabet's up 45%."
"6233680","6235940"," That Amazon's up 66%. "
"6236900","6239660"," AMD's up 78%."
"6239660","6242760"," And now you've got this repeated news."
"6243060","6243680"," It's no surprise. "
"6244180","6244280"," Bill."
"6244600","6248360"," Why I continues to dominate the investor conversation."
"6249020","6254900"," Why it remains among the best idea stocks from investors and whether it continues to lean in. "
"6256040","6259360"," Relative to everything else, which there are a lot of calls for catch-up trades."
"6259520","6260040"," Is that the other?"
"6261440","6262700"," But for the actionists."
"6263400","6268340"," Yeah, I think it can be a lot of rotation talk earlier this week and last week and saw the"
"6268340","6269540"," Dow continue to move out. "
"6269800","6270860"," I think that's premature."
"6271400","6275940"," And I really think that the leadership is going to be maintained here in tech as the year, you"
"6275940","6276660"," know, finishes out."
"6277100","6281620"," Now, when we do look the next year, I believe, yes, health care in banks, they could really start"
"6281620","6282260"," to perform a little better. "
"6282260","6283440"," They could start to see a little more cyclical."
"6283960","6288860"," But this AI revolution that's been taking place, it's a narrative that we keep seeing headline"
"6288860","6291440"," after headline that reinvigorates a dead take."
"6291720","6296440"," Whether we're, you know, we're playing this up too much or it is what it is. "
"6296920","6298620"," It seems to be a battle royal."
"6299120","6301380"," Put up, put up AMD, though, between these doors."
"6301580","6305140"," We're going to get to that in a minute because that remains a part of the umbrella story. "
"6305280","6306060"," That's the battle royal."
"6306220","6307420"," We'll talk about that well."
"6307580","6308300"," That's another one. "
"6308720","6311040"," Maybe you need a couple of octagons."
"6311880","6318880"," You can put in video, they can square off on a co-main event with Microsoft and Alphabet because"
"6318880","6322520"," Steve Kovac, I mean, it feels to me like that's really what you have here."
"6322620","6324140"," A battle royal between these two companies. "
"6324860","6329420"," Microsoft has had the lead and Alphabet's been not so fast and we're going to show you."
"6329640","6330400"," Well, now they're showing."
"6331420","6333080"," Yeah, that's exactly right, Scott. "
"6333340","6341020"," So, look, here's where we are now."
"6341840","6347220"," Microsoft and partner opening eyes, still about a year ahead of Google, if you add it all up here."
"6347360","6352280"," Google shares up today, of course, following the announcement of Gemini, that new AI model that"
"6352280","6357400"," will eventually be part of its chatbot, Bard, plus other products like search and productivity apps"
"6357400","6358180"," like Google Docs. "
"6358800","6362900"," Unclear, though, why shares didn't really react to the news yesterday, but it is the optimism"
"6362900","6368280"," around Gemini today, seen as the force driving it up about five and a half percent now, but it's"
"6368280","6373920"," going to take a while for Gemini to roll out and even longer for Google to start monetizing those"
"6373920","6379620"," capabilities, especially in search where the company has said it'll see the big benefit from"
"6379620","6380540"," generative AI."
"6381200","6383700"," Also unclear, the impact it'll have on duet."
"6383860","6385160"," That's the productivity assistant. "
"6385680","6390700"," It's previewing now for business customers and eventually plans to sell at the same price Microsoft"
"6390700","6391880"," selling co-pilot."
"6391880","6398220"," Google execs also dodge questions about whether or not Gemini is better than OpenAI's latest model,"
"6398520","6403200"," GPT-4, but they did say it can outperform GPT-3 and a half."
"6403400","6407300"," That's the free version of chat GPT a lot of people are using right now. "
"6407660","6409440"," In the meantime, Microsoft is plowing ahead."
"6409620","6414840"," It's already added its OpenAI powered co-pilot across a range of products like Windows and Bing,"
"6415360","6418920"," and it's selling co-pilot to business customers at a hefty price."
"6418920","6425300"," Not to mention the benefit it's Azure Cloud gets from all those third parties tapping into OpenAI's"
"6425300","6426360"," model as well, guys. "
"6426820","6432360"," Yeah, you know, I'm looking at the I mentioned the calls on the street today, Steve, and the kind"
"6432360","6439300"," of language that the analyst community is using today where one is talking about alphabet AI"
"6439300","6441500"," capabilities that this shows it."
"6441620","6446240"," That this is a significant innovation that they're showing their muscle development."
"6446820","6453100"," All the things that theoretically were being questioned in the last 12 months or so, because it was"
"6453100","6458160"," deemed that Microsoft was the power lifter and that alphabet was just going to get the scraps. "
"6458980","6464940"," Yeah, and that's part of it, but also what's true here is that Google had all these capabilities"
"6464940","6469440"," and they'd been sitting on it for so long and now they're just trying to play the catch up game."
"6469440","6474520"," And I'll just point out that, you know, some of the stuff that we're seeing from Gemini, you can't"
"6474520","6475320"," use it yet, Scott."
"6476040","6482200"," It's going to be a couple more weeks or months before the most capable and advanced models of"
"6482200","6483260"," Gemini are going to come out. "
"6483660","6486320"," I'll point to some skepticism also coming out."
"6486440","6491120"," The information had an interesting report this morning kind of throwing cold water on this demo"
"6491120","6491400"," video."
"6491660","6493360"," We're showing you right now that CEO. "
"6493360","6499660"," Senator Pichai shared on his social media showing this is called multimodal what we're looking at"
"6499660","6500020"," right now."
"6500180","6506120"," That means it can both look at images and text and voice and kind of correlate all that together"
"6506120","6511120"," based on the way they showed this demo though the information report kind of casting some doubt."
"6511160","6516700"," Maybe it was kind of carefully crafted to make it look more capable than it will be when you"
"6516700","6518420"," actually put it into people's hands. "
"6518420","6522280"," Again, we just don't know because this model hasn't come out yet."
"6522480","6524640"," People haven't been able to really play with it."
"6524800","6530340"," So, you know, always have a little dose of skepticism when you have a pre recorded demo like that. "
"6531000","6532560"," They can easily cut around it."
"6532640","6537840"," If you look at their blog post, they kind of explain how they actually got Gemini to do what we"
"6537840","6538480"," saw it do."
"6538600","6541880"," It's a little more nuanced than just kind of the whiz bang stuff. "
"6542480","6543420"," Pichai shed on Twitter."
"6543420","6544620"," Yeah, appreciate it Steve."
"6544840","6547660"," Thanks very much for putting all of this into perspective for us as Josh. "
"6547860","6548860"," I turn back to you."
"6548920","6556360"," Look, the narrative is going to be until it isn't that this is Microsoft's lead that they made the"
"6556360","6557920"," most significant advance."
"6558520","6565280"," That's why there was all the hype about it and that alphabet's still going to have to play catch up"
"6565280","6569820"," in some regard to Gerstner's point, which may be the overarching point of all. "
"6569820","6575640"," You know, he gave the example of being in a room speaking to a thousand people who uses, you know,"
"6575820","6578140"," chat, GPT or whatever everybody raises their hand."
"6578340","6582320"," There's like scant number of hands go up when you talk about using alphabet."
"6582680","6588720"," If we would have done that in 1997 asked a room full of young people when they use the internet,"
"6588980","6589380"," what do they use?"
"6589540","6590200"," They would have said AOL. "
"6590660","6591680"," I don't think that matters."
"6592080","6595060"," I know it matters now and I know it's the story so far."
"6595440","6596040"," Stories change. "
"6596620","6597560"," This is what I think matters."
"6597560","6600040"," Large language models will be ubiquitous."
"6600180","6601700"," There will be many of them. "
"6602060","6606580"," What's really going to happen in the next phase when you talk to technologists and the people that"
"6606580","6611420"," understand how you turn a technology into an actual product."
"6611880","6618660"," What's really going to happen is hyper specific large language models to address certain"
"6618660","6619460"," industries."
"6619460","6622760"," You're going to see every industry is going to have its own champion. "
"6622940","6628800"," Now, some of these will be overarching and address all of it and that will be the dominance, but"
"6628800","6634920"," that's not going to be the important thing to be who can get their users to interact with these"
"6634920","6636600"," models and pay for it."
"6636760","6637900"," And Microsoft will do great."
"6638320","6644080"," I have no doubt, but Google has 1.8 billion with a B Gmail users. "
"6644380","6646840"," That's just one part of what Google does."
"6646840","6651420"," We won't even include any of the business services or the cloud service or YouTube."
"6651900","6652520"," Put it all aside. "
"6653160","6654260"," Just Gmail alone."
"6655120","6659160"," Imagine waking up in the morning and telling Gmail to respond to all your emails."
"6659660","6661680"," It's literally going to do so in your voice. "
"6662100","6663080"," I know it's not today."
"6663540","6664580"," That's where we're going."
"6665060","6667760"," And so I think there's a lot of room for multiple platforms to make money. "
"6667980","6668100"," All right."
"6668220","6672280"," So your highs of the day there for shares of alphabet as you see and we can keep those up."
"6672280","6679160"," Look, maybe 2024 is going to be the year then where Apple makes its big splash in its own right"
"6679160","6684880"," for a stock that's at $195 back above $3 trillion bill in market cap. "
"6685160","6689480"," Let's not forget about that stock because it's been an absolute beast."
"6690240","6695840"," It just doesn't get talked about in terms of AI as much as either alphabet or Microsoft do."
"6696580","6700860"," Talking about Apple in particular, the price that held at $170, I think, phenomenal. "
"6701220","6705400"," But the keyword across Microsoft, Alphabet, as well as Apple, is ecosystem."
"6706060","6709220"," They all have a fabulous ecosystem."
"6709840","6714480"," And I mean, look at Microsoft, the co-pilot, 40%, quarter over quarter increase. "
"6715140","6715640"," Apple's ecosystem."
"6716120","6721480"," I mean, the services part of their business is growing and becoming a bigger piece of the pie that"
"6721480","6721760"," they have."
"6721760","6724960"," So I expect Apple to be setting a new record high here. "
"6725080","6725920"," I mean, as we close out the year."
"6726080","6726220"," All right."
"6726300","6730160"," Let's do AMD because it's surging on its own AI announcement. "
"6730160","6731180"," Of course, these new chips."
"6731640","6733640"," It wants to take on Nvidia too."
"6734100","6735500"," And that's a big part of this story. "
"6735680","6739880"," Josh Brown, you know, you made the case for AMD when you bought it recently and I know you wanted"
"6739880","6740600"," to talk about it."
"6740600","6741900"," So let's do it right here."
"6742200","6742560"," Yeah. "
"6742680","6744080"," Look, I bought a little bit of AMD."
"6744280","6745440"," I obviously didn't buy enough."
"6745680","6748700"," You never buy enough of the ones that run 20, 30% immediately. "
"6748700","6750960"," So it's not a big position for me."
"6751200","6754600"," I'm much bigger in Nvidia, but I want to be in both."
"6755040","6764060"," And I talked a little bit about Lisa Sue and how aggressive AMD wants to be in inference chips, in"
"6764060","6765440"," the training chip market. "
"6765840","6767000"," They're just going to play."
"6767420","6771080"," What they don't have that Nvidia has is the ecosystem."
"6771720","6776440"," They don't have the same software offering and they're not as dominant there, but they can make"
"6776440","6776860"," inroads. "
"6776860","6778980"," They don't need to get 50% of the market."
"6779140","6780700"," This is not Coke versus Pepsi."
"6781220","6785440"," They can get a really big chunk of the market and they do have a software platform. "
"6785820","6791020"," So some people will be standardizing on AMD's AI chips."
"6791020","6791820"," It's just a fact."
"6792340","6793880"," So how much of that is in the stock?"
"6794340","6795700"," Maybe a bunch, but not all. "
"6796000","6798000"," I still think there's room for this name to trade higher."
"6798440","6799660"," So I'm going to stick with both holdings."
"6800160","6803920"," I don't see that as contradictory to believe that there's enough room for both to win. "
"6803920","6804560"," This is ripping."
"6804860","6806640"," Bill, you own AMD as well."
"6806800","6808780"," Then we'll get to the Nvidia side of it with Brynn. "
"6808980","6811780"," I know all three of you own the stock, but give me something on AMD."
"6812180","6812960"," That stock's up in your separate."
"6813100","6817800"," It could have easily done it as our chart of the day, but the alphabet move is so outsized that"
"6817800","6818380"," how could you not?"
"6818780","6824260"," They're implementing chiplet architecture, which will make their GPUs more scalable than Nvidia"
"6824260","6824660"," potentially. "
"6825160","6831440"," And as I've pointed to before, I think that AMD is eating into a little bit of Nvidia's lunch on"
"6831440","6832460"," the software side of it."
"6832820","6836280"," Nvidia's still number one, but now AMD could be number three."
"6836580","6838600"," We're kind of just eating in there just a little bit. "
"6838760","6840300"," So we own both."
"6840640","6842660"," I think we have to have exposure in both of them right now."
"6842680","6843320"," One of you is something crazy. "
"6844080","6844340"," They're cousins."
"6845420","6845760"," You know that?"
"6845980","6847280"," Jensen Wang and Lisa Sill."
"6847480","6849620"," They're both from Taiwan, and they're like distantly related. "
"6850280","6851960"," She's wearing leather jackets now."
"6852560","6854460"," I like everything that's going on in this space."
"6854660","6855280"," I have to be honest with you. "
"6855500","6857340"," Yeah, there was a big deal yesterday in the interview."
"6857340","6860780"," Of course it said that Dr. Lisa Sue had with Christina parts and elbows."
"6860940","6870180"," Yeah, I mean, first of all, it was reported that this year both meta and Microsoft purchased around"
"6870180","6875820"," 150,000 each H 100 and H and H 800 chips. "
"6876100","6879440"," And so it's like Microsoft, of course, is going to partner with AMD."
"6879940","6885680"," No one wants one company to have a monopoly here and also, you know, margins do mean revert."
"6885680","6887520"," And so I think that you have. "
"6887740","6888160"," I'm not surprised."
"6888420","6892500"," I didn't know they were related, Josh, but not surprising because Lisa Sue and Jensen Wong are"
"6892500","6895420"," probably the two best operators that we have."
"6895820","6898320"," But there is for sure more than room for one. "
"6898440","6903260"," And I think that you will see more big companies like the Microsofts, like the Metas, which the two"
"6903260","6908920"," biggest buyers of Nvidia wanting to diversify their supply lines, not only with what they're"
"6908920","6910740"," creating, which I don't think is going to move the needle."
"6910740","6916840"," But AMD is going to absolutely be a winner of the next few years because Jensen and Lisa have both"
"6916840","6920200"," said this is a trillion dollar data spent over the next decade."
"6920200","6921640"," We're just in the first innings. "
"6921960","6928360"," Yeah, that's the, you know, this is obviously the rising tide that's lifting all of the AI boats."
"6929080","6934000"," Broadcom included, by the way, which reports its own earnings in overtime tonight, Bill, you used"
"6934000","6934500"," to own it."
"6934740","6935440"," You sold it. "
"6935600","6937180"," It's had a remarkable run in its own right."
"6937260","6939320"," It's up 77% over 12 months."
"6939320","6939700"," Yeah. "
"6939920","6940600"," We owned it."
"6940800","6945960"," Now, the way of piecing this portfolio together, we had two very tactical plays on during that time"
"6945960","6948500"," that run in June to July, owning Broadcom and Tesla."
"6948880","6949880"," Those are the first two I cut. "
"6950120","6951960"," I mean, it was really, we were so bullish at the time."
"6952100","6953120"," So again, very tactical."
"6953620","6955280"," I don't dislike the company. "
"6955400","6957040"," I just can't fit into the portfolio right now."
"6957240","6962480"," What I do like from a price perspective is it broke out of that 900 mark and now it's retesting"
"6962480","6963860"," support going into earnings."
"6963860","6965080"," They're operating margins. "
"6965500","6968100"," They were one of the most efficiently run semiconductor companies."
"6968500","6972940"," And I think that if we look at that, if they continue to confirm that, I mean, this stock, it's"
"6972940","6973940"," going to be on my radar to be buying again."
"6974040","6975160"," It's got to find a way to fit into the portfolio. "
"6975520","6976360"," You did sell Marvell."
"6976740","6976920"," Yeah."
"6977080","6977960"," So maybe you have some space. "
"6978780","6978800"," Yeah."
"6979180","6981960"," Well, there was an ad, a sort of swap."
"6982200","6983220"," I think we'll cover later in the show. "
"6983320","6984140"," I won't say it right now."
"6984220","6986660"," But yeah, Marvell, it hasn't lived up to what we were hoping."
"6986940","6991320"," Big move today in Marvell took advantage of raising a little bit of cash there as in our bottom 10. "
"6991320","6995480"," Now, the problem is they connect data centers and it's not really on the GPU side."
"6995700","6999440"," So not really benefiting as much as we would have hoped in this big AI craze."
"6999540","7001680"," So that's something right there that I think could hold it back. "
"7001800","7007020"," It does lead to the conversation because this dominates the conversation about what these stocks"
"7007020","7008140"," are going to do in the year ahead."
"7008360","7013200"," Will you have a similar make up of the market move that you did this year in which the biggest"
"7013200","7015580"," stocks in the market obviously led the way."
"7015580","7019480"," And now we're talking about catch up trades like you've had from November until now. "
"7019600","7021720"," Savita Subramanian over Bank of America."
"7021760","7025140"," Josh says new S&P high without mag seven leadership."
"7025600","7026000"," Easy. "
"7026420","7028360"," Five thousand for the S&P next year."
"7028520","7031020"," Don't need mag seven leadership at all."
"7031240","7033920"," Even if they flat line, you can get pick up from everywhere else. "
"7034040","7034300"," What do you think?"
"7035160","7036660"," Listen, that would be great."
"7037060","7042780"," I think historically, unfortunately, any time that you've seen this big of a spread between the top"
"7042780","7045240"," five or 10 stocks and the rest of the market."
"7045240","7047760"," The resolution has actually been a catch down. "
"7048420","7051480"," And what that means is other stocks have held up well."
"7051860","7054860"," Those big stocks have come in and it's been in the midst of a correction."
"7055480","7060860"," It's it's rare that you would have this much out performance of the best stocks and then all of a"
"7060860","7063020"," sudden everything else comes roaring back and matches. "
"7063480","7064200"," It could happen."
"7064540","7065520"," It doesn't never happen."
"7065520","7066420"," It's just it's rare. "
"7066840","7067780"," I hope she's right though."
"7068020","7068660"," That would be nice."
"7069140","7073280"," Most of us on the desk on the show each week own more than just the top seven stocks. "
"7073280","7076120"," But I have to tell you, just do an eye test."
"7076420","7077000"," You don't need stats."
"7077500","7081260"," You don't need to give me give you data on internals. "
"7081440","7082360"," Look at your portfolio."
"7083100","7085960"," Almost everything looks amazing right now."
"7086060","7092480"," If you just look at 90 day charts on your top 10 or 20 positions away from mag seven, you"
"7092480","7093660"," probably agree with me. "
"7094120","7096960"," This is the time of year that we're in."
"7097160","7097860"," This is what happens."
"7098260","7099600"," The tax law selling is over. "
"7100160","7101580"," Even the dogs get a little bit of love."
"7101580","7104680"," There's another layer of growth companies that's not mag seven."
"7104980","7106740"," They've all had tremendous results. "
"7106940","7107980"," I'm just looking at names."
"7108160","7110120"," I'm in like zoom is working now."
"7110780","7112960"," Crowd strike and new 52 week high yesterday. "
"7113320","7114860"," These are not mag seven stocks."
"7115180","7117420"," They're just road stories that are working."
"7117980","7122000"," And in that vein, you know, I've had the opportunity to make a couple of cells. "
"7122260","7123800"," This fall and winter."
"7124180","7124380"," I don't know."
"7124440","7125400"," We're going to do this one next door. "
"7125660","7126620"," We'll do a couple of minutes."
"7127000","7131020"," But the only place I guess you wouldn't want to look at for great performance."
"7131020","7135460"," Brin would be energy, which you do have a lot of and it's down again. "
"7136280","7139320"," So oil gets a day's worth of stabilization."
"7139600","7140780"," We'll see if it amounts to anything."
"7141000","7143600"," But we're talking 70 bucks and it's been on a steady stream lower. "
"7145280","7145760"," Yeah."
"7145840","7150080"," I mean, I think ultimately what happened is like today you have news more about infant inventory"
"7150080","7150880"," bills."
"7151260","7156860"," But I think the narrative around China is the elephant sitting on energy prices and the data out of"
"7156860","7158880"," China continues to get weaker and weaker. "
"7158880","7165120"," So while the US economy is humming right along, that China data, which is so important to global"
"7165120","7168140"," GDP, continues to weigh on the price of oil."
"7168600","7173340"," But ultimately, you know, ultimately, I think that early next week, energy is really sold off."
"7173440","7175920"," I think you're going to get as a trade a really good time to step in. "
"7175980","7177360"," You're already seeing it stabilizing today."
"7177720","7179280"," So I wouldn't give up on the asset class."
"7179360","7180740"," I definitely think it's a good trade. "
"7180960","7185060"," But until China stabilizes, I think you're going to continue to see weakness to the downside in the"
"7185060","7185240"," space."
"7185240","7186520"," Let's just note too."
"7186660","7188080"," I'm looking at a high of the day for alphabet. "
"7188400","7191480"," Let's just show in today on the back of your guys conversation about that."
"7192300","7194680"," Almost 6.4%. NASDAQ's ripping now."
"7194820","7196100"," It's up near 200 points. "
"7196100","7197900"," It's a big move for a multi trillion dollar market."
"7197900","7202820"," We said the biggest percentage move in alphabet since July."
"7203660","7208660"," Of course, you know, there are a lot of bears out there still and they're not convinced that Mag 7"
"7208660","7213380"," is going to do as well in the new year, nor are they convinced that risk assets in general. "
"7213380","7218420"," Marco Kalanovic like clockwork right before our show or during puts out a note."
"7218420","7222360"," We're not positive on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro over the next 12"
"7222360","7222600"," months."
"7222740","7225940"," Primary reason interest rate shock that's already happened. "
"7226080","7228680"," That's going to negatively impact economic activity."
"7228700","7233700"," Doesn't matter if there's a recession or not hard to see an acceleration of the economy or a"
"7233700","7239500"," lasting risk rally without a meaningful and significant reduction of interest rates."
"7240000","7241620"," What do we what do we think about this bill?"
"7241620","7247000"," Well, I mean, right now I it's hard to say, okay, I fully disagree with him. "
"7247060","7248860"," But he's he's he's making a point here."
"7249100","7249520"," Whatever you want."
"7249600","7252160"," Yeah, and I I'm not negative going to next year. "
"7252280","7254700"," And I think the gross one kind of steady kind of stays steady."
"7254700","7258220"," We're not going to, you know, just see the things fall apart."
"7258440","7264700"," One concern I really do have is the rate cut of going into March is fed watch tool in the"
"7264700","7265180"," CME group. "
"7265320","7269360"," You think that's a little aggressive by the market to think that in three meetings time you're"
"7269360","7270100"," going to get your first cut."
"7270100","7274760"," Yes, and the market could be disappointed with that rates rates will rise from from there."
"7274820","7276860"," And I think that could be a little bit to digest. "
"7277540","7281260"," I do think the many really good point on the tailwinds coming into the earth China reopening."
"7281600","7285120"," But it really wasn't much of a tailwind because it really kind of died off quickly."
"7285200","7288080"," And Britain made a point about about China as well just now. "
"7288420","7292420"," And I think for energy that's a little concerning, but but there's other stuff."
"7292600","7296240"," I think China there's some import data last night for copper was huge."
"7296240","7301420"," I think there's some stuff here that globally the growth is going to say very steady and so I'm not"
"7301420","7301720"," negative. "
"7301920","7303320"," I don't I don't see that being a negative point."
"7303440","7307020"," You're indirectly teasing a new move that you make which we're going to do in our following block."
"7307020","7307620"," I see you. "
"7307920","7308800"," I see you Josh."
"7308800","7309720"," Try to do the same thing."
"7309840","7310760"," But we'll wait after the break. "
"7310820","7311320"," What about this."
"7311380","7317840"," I mean, a year ago he was saying the rally off the October lows is a bear market rally."
"7318680","7319360"," Avoid risk. "
"7319840","7321280"," I mean, it's July."
"7321900","7323060"," He was saying AI bubble."
"7323060","7330300"," I mean, if you if you had followed many of these kinds of warnings, unfortunately, if you're a"
"7330300","7332720"," professional, you're trailing like big time. "
"7332840","7336580"," It's really, really hard to catch up to the NASDAQ up 50%."
"7336580","7344420"," It's really, really hard to catch up to an S&P up mid teens percentage almost 20% at the"
"7344420","7345400"," current rate of rally."
"7345680","7350040"," So a lot of the people who you see buying these stocks now at 52 week highs. "
"7350040","7351820"," Who do you think is chasing AMD?"
"7352540","7354780"," Who do you think is chasing alphabet here on AI?"
"7355440","7357960"," It's the people that in July said, you know what?"
"7358180","7358780"," Yeah, it's a bubble."
"7359080","7359640"," I agree."
"7359880","7360740"," So it's it's difficult. "
"7361020","7363500"," I don't I'm not particularly good at calling these chefs either."
"7363680","7364800"," So no, no disrespect."
"7365300","7371300"," But I I try I try to like understand the point the strategist is making, but they're not rearranged"
"7371300","7375220"," my whole portfolio as though that's the only outcome that could possibly be true. "
"7375220","7376500"," All right, speaking of your portfolio."
"7377220","7380120"," So Josh is selling a name that's done quite well this year."
"7380480","7381580"," He's mentioned it many times. "
"7381720","7383300"," We're going to tell you what that is after the break."
"7383980","7386660"," Bill indirectly teased the stock that he just fought."
"7387020","7390020"," Tell you what that is in a couple minutes when halftime returns. "
"7557100","7557800"," I will back."
"7557940","7558980"," Let's go through these names now."
"7559100","7560680"," Josh Brown, you sold AOS. "
"7561360","7561520"," Yeah."
"7561660","7562940"," AOSmith housing play."
"7563760","7564760"," How water meters and the like. "
"7564760","7565560"," Yeah."
"7565880","7571680"," So I had expected AOSmith to trade more in line with the home builders, which is ripped."
"7572060","7572340"," Yeah. "
"7572500","7574460"," I mean, it's gone up, but it doesn't go up enough."
"7574460","7576140"," It doesn't match that space."
"7576860","7580420"," So it was like an inferior way to play something that I was right about. "
"7580560","7581560"," I just expressed it wrong."
"7582260","7586020"," So the XHB, for example, is up 50% on the year."
"7586100","7587820"," Well, I mean, let's be honest. "
"7587820","7589140"," It's not like you expressed it wrong."
"7589980","7593180"," The stocks up 35% you're not trying to make me feel better."
"7593180","7595180"," It's just I should have just I should have just. "
"7595320","7597900"," I mean, the home builders have been hitting all time highs."
"7597900","7598460"," I get it."
"7598620","7600200"," But I mean, the stock's still up 35%. "
"7600200","7600820"," Right."
"7601020","7601960"," You know, I have two weaknesses."
"7602520","7605640"," Polio string cheese and trying to get too clever with my trades. "
"7605860","7608860"," What I should have done was bought the index of home builders."
"7609060","7612420"," But instead, I bought the hot water heaters."
"7612500","7613420"," It's a great company. "
"7613600","7615240"," I think actually chart looks great."
"7615380","7616720"," I think the stock of work is way higher."
"7617240","7621980"," One of my big ideas for 2024 is that rates are going to moderate. "
"7621980","7623740"," Mortgage rates are now crashing."
"7624180","7626140"," They've been coming down six straight weeks."
"7626700","7629820"," I think the deep freeze in the housing market is going to unfreeze. "
"7630080","7631260"," I want to be a player there."
"7631560","7633680"," I have names like Zillow on my radar."
"7634200","7639480"," This is no longer going to give me enough bounce if I'm right about that idea for next year. "
"7639800","7641420"," So goodbye to A.O. Smith."
"7641680","7641940"," It worked."
"7642280","7642700"," It went up. "
"7642860","7643280"," I'm happy."
"7643440","7644640"," It's a 52 week high right now."
"7644860","7649020"," I just think that there are going to be better places to be if what I expect for next year"
"7649020","7649500"," plays out. "
"7649500","7650560"," I don't want to gloss over."
"7650640","7651800"," Zillow is high right now."
"7652960","7653940"," I'm watching it. "
"7654180","7655320"," I'm looking at certain rates."
"7655720","7658400"," I think there's going to be a better place to play."
"7658700","7658880"," Okay. "
"7659120","7659920"," So we'll watch that one."
"7660240","7661120"," That's letter Z."
"7661500","7664020"," Bill, you bought Southern Copper Corp."
"7664320","7668720"," You indirectly mentioned that you had bought a copper related thing. "
"7668880","7669140"," That's it."
"7669260","7669940"," S-C-C-O."
"7670380","7670600"," Yeah. "
"7672120","7674760"," I think the best pure play in copper."
"7674960","7676120"," A lot of people look at it free for it."
"7676120","7680000"," But Southern Copper is really, I think, the best pure play in copper right now. "
"7680260","7684660"," One of the things that quietly has taken place over the past couple of months is the Chinese you"
"7684660","7685960"," want strengthening against the dollar."
"7686100","7689560"," It's up 3.5% against the dollar, which is a big move."
"7690840","7692600"," China has been de-stocking commodities. "
"7693120","7696500"," I think as we turn into this year, we're going to see a lot of demand, a lot of new"
"7696500","7696780"," imports."
"7697020","7699320"," And that import data, shout out to Ola Hanson of Saxo-Vic."
"7699420","7704160"," I saw it early this morning, 10% increase month over month, which is the highest almost two years"
"7704160","7706380"," on copper being imported from China. "
"7706500","7710560"," So I think this is the start of a big turn in commodities as we look into next year."
"7711060","7715580"," The sort of segments built as like buys and sells, obviously, but there is news around other"
"7715580","7716380"," committee names too."
"7716480","7719420"," Bill's yours included Domino's investor day. "
"7720080","7720860"," You just bought it last week."
"7721500","7722160"," I mean, it's performed."
"7722420","7724380"," I mean, timing was really well with that. "
"7724440","7725160"," It's performed really well."
"7725360","7728480"," One of the things that stood out to me most is the search analytics."
"7728480","7732440"," In middle of September, they launched a new loyalty program. "
"7732920","7736360"," And ever since then, Domino's has been search results have been increasing."
"7736880","7741540"," On top of that, they're going to be on every single store on the Uber Eats platform, I think, in"
"7741540","7742180"," the turn of the year."
"7742540","7744380"," So that's going to be another tailwind to the end. "
"7744380","7745540"," What up that chart, DPZ."
"7745840","7746500"," Can we put it real quick?"
"7746700","7749160"," I was going to say, the weakness doesn't extend to the thing for us."
"7749160","7751000"," Like, give me like a three-year or a one. "
"7751140","7751800"," Like, pull it back."
"7752120","7753140"," I don't do it today."
"7753720","7753900"," All right. "
"7754020","7754040"," Whatever."
"7754460","7755040"," One of the best performing stocks."
"7755320","7757140"," Let's say you do nothing about technical analysis. "
"7757140","7758800"," What do you think happens here?"
"7759160","7762900"," 400 has been significant resistance back to last summer."
"7763080","7763920"," It's 18 months."
"7764380","7767940"," Every time it's gotten to this level, it's hit a 10 on that ceiling. "
"7768380","7771800"," When it punches through, and I think it's about to, what do you think happens here?"
"7772200","7774300"," This was $600, $700 stock?"
"7774600","7774780"," Oh, yeah."
"7775080","7775180"," All right."
"7775520","7776280"," I love that. "
"7776480","7781260"," Domino's fits within this theme of stocks we threw away because we thought they were only good for"
"7781260","7781840"," work from home."
"7782240","7783660"," We thought they were only pandemic."
"7784340","7786200"," Domino's absolutely is in that category. "
"7786200","7787700"," I referenced Zoom before."
"7788120","7790980"," That one technically is starting to set up just like Domino's."
"7791220","7795300"," I really think there's an opportunity in a lot of these names we've thrown out that are getting"
"7795300","7796940"," this come back here at the end of the year. "
"7797260","7802920"," We're starting to recognize that these brands mean a lot more than just, hey, I'm home."
"7803040","7804660"," I might as well go on an app and order something."
"7804980","7806280"," I like this DPZ call. "
"7806500","7807640"," I think it works it's way higher."
"7807680","7810000"," Well, there's no better way to feed a family of four."
"7810260","7811520"," And especially from..."
"7811520","7812000"," Well, that's not true. "
"7812000","7816160"," Well, I mean, I think as in how efficiently and timely and any evening."
"7817040","7818060"," Wait a minute."
"7818280","7820760"," You're going to say something like that to the sky. "
"7822180","7823600"," There's a better way."
"7823600","7824300"," There's a better way."
"7824960","7826720"," But they're target audiences. "
"7827220","7831360"," There's no better way to feed a family of four at one a.m. after they all come home from"
"7831360","7831680"," a wedding."
"7832220","7834880"," That's the domino use case for a family of four."
"7834880","7837760"," Officially for at a low cost price point. "
"7837980","7838120"," All right."
"7838160","7838860"," That's where they're going to accelerate."
"7839040","7840000"," All right. "
"7840000","7840900"," So, what we're going to do today, Brenda, is yours."
"7841140","7843680"," Avvie, the second big deal in a couple of weeks."
"7845480","7849060"," Yeah, close to $20 billion between immunogen and cerebell. "
"7849380","7855280"," And so, this is a good example is outside of energy, healthcare as a sector has the highest free"
"7855280","7856060"," cash flow yield."
"7856360","7857260"," And this is a perfect example."
"7857640","7861260"," Avvie, you know, going into these, I think, had a free cash flow yield around 8%. "
"7861260","7862640"," And what are they doing?"
"7863180","7866840"," They are building out their oncology and their neuroscience with these two acquisitions."
"7866840","7867160"," acquisitions."
"7867760","7873540"," I think what's most positive is making two decent sized acquisitions and really the stock is up on"
"7873540","7873800"," the week. "
"7874080","7874920"," The market likes this."
"7875440","7881080"," Adve has come out and reaffirmed that $11 trough earnings and so I think the markets like they are"
"7881080","7882120"," investing in their future."
"7882620","7886760"," This helps them with their pipeline and we'll see in the next few years if these two acquisitions"
"7886760","7891300"," were accretive to the earnings but I think it's very positive the stock's been up for the week. "
"7891620","7892180"," All right."
"7892420","7893920"," Bertha Coombs has the headlines for us."
"7893980","7894340"," Hi Bertha. "
"7894540","7894840"," Hi Scott."
"7894840","7901720"," Authorities say more than £18,000 of cocaine from six separate drug smuggling seizures were"
"7901720","7903700"," offloaded in San Diego this week."
"7904140","7908860"," Cocaine was recovered by the Coast Guard off the coast of Mexico, Central America and South"
"7908860","7909320"," America. "
"7909860","7913640"," It estimated to have a street value of nearly $240 million."
"7914500","7921780"," US Customs and Border Protection reports more than 40 tons of cocaine were seized so far in 2023."
"7922540","7928400"," Denmark's Parliament passed the law today making it illegal to burn the Koran in public places. "
"7928880","7934720"," The move is an attempt to de-escalate tensions with Muslim countries following a series of Danish"
"7934720","7937660"," protests where Islam's holy book was burned."
"7938220","7940620"," The new law also covers other religious texts."
"7941440","7947520"," And prosecutors are accusing a former Jacksonville Jaguars employee of stealing more than $22"
"7947520","7949660"," million from the football franchise. "
"7949660","7955800"," Court documents allege that the employee exploited the organization's virtual credit card program"
"7955800","7963800"," and that between 2019 and 2023 the employee allegedly used the cards to purchase two vehicles, a"
"7963800","7968740"," condominium, cryptocurrency and of course, a designer watch."
"7969300","7969580"," Scott?"
"7970140","7973900"," I thought you were going to say of course the cryptocurrency part but neither here nor there."
"7974020","7974960"," Bertha, thank you very much. "
"7975140","7975540"," Appreciate that."
"7975720","7976340"," That's Bertha Coombs."
"7976340","7979900"," Coming up, calls of the day including top picks and financials and software. "
"7980280","7981560"," We'll do that after this quick break."
"8050030","8056570"," Bank Canada's Grovel says in her statement that while we saw welcome improvement in October"
"8056570","8058550"," inflation measures we need to see further progress."
"8059170","8062130"," We have made progress on restoring price stability but we're not there yet. "
"8062770","8067490"," Canada needs more homes and we need to make housing supply more responsive to increases in demand."
"8068290","8071830"," Housing in balance has serious consequences for shoulder price inflation."
"8072270","8078410"," In October, it contributed 1.8 percentage points to total readings of 3.1% and we need all levels"
"8078410","8081590"," of government to work together on a variety of housing policies to food supply. "
"8082090","8087510"," Jumping demographic demand coupled with existing supply and structural supply issues could explain"
"8087510","8089590"," why rain inflation continues to decline."
"8090730","8097610"," Housing activity grew with 8.3% in third quarter but this is far below what is needed to make"
"8097610","8099770"," up with the growing housing needs."
"8100570","8102930"," Rain inflation accelerated to a 40 year high in October. "
"8103630","8107370"," Housing supply has not kept pace with recent increases in immigration."
"8111550","8118230"," Also, she says that these indicators are helping us assess where the inflation is on a sustained"
"8118230","8119330"," path of 2%."
"8119730","8123850"," The economy is now roughly in balance but we are closely watching inflation expectations, waste"
"8123850","8125270"," growth and corporate price behaviour. "
"8132520","8136820"," Do you want to say up to date with the latest and beyond the bleeding edge of news for non "
"8136820","8137700","-farm payrolls?"
"8138260","8143220"," Then sign up today and get our special offer or financial use pro for years worth of our service"
"8143220","8146860"," for the price of 1 month and say 92%."
"8163140","8164220"," All right, calls the day."
"8164360","8171100"," First up is Goldman, named the top 2024 pick at KBW, 400 bucks the price target above average"
"8171100","8176380"," growth expected, inexpensive balance sheet relative to the return outlook. "
"8176780","8181500"," Bryn, you used to own Goldman, or you sold it, I don't know, about six weeks ago?"
"8182980","8184080"," Yeah, that's about right."
"8184400","8189920"," I mean, listen, this has been a year of transition, Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley are three of"
"8189920","8190420"," the best banks."
"8190420","8196400"," If you think M&A is going to improve next year, I think Goldman is a natural buy. "
"8197260","8202139"," I would just rather own my Nvidia, sell calls against it, own more healthcare, some other names"
"8202139","8202379"," there."
"8202680","8204360"," I just don't want to be in the financials."
"8204459","8209900"," I still think the private credit firms are doing all of the things the banks used to do and that"
"8209900","8215580"," the banks in general outside of M&A are much more anesthetized and will never have that growth that"
"8215580","8217219"," they had prior great financial crisis. "
"8217219","8219959"," We have rebound trade and financials coming up."
"8220240","8224260"," I mean, if you're going to have a bubble next year, Goldman will do great."
"8224540","8230820"," That's when that stock out performs, when there's a specular bubble, 2021 is a really great example"
"8230820","8231219"," of that. "
"8231420","8236459"," It's one of the best years ever for shareholders in Goldman, the downside always looks like this."
"8237059","8241219"," So, you know, that's the type of stock it is if you're really, really bullish about underwriting"
"8241219","8248080"," coming back and IPOs and M&A and LBOs and all of the acronyms, yeah, Goldman's going to work great."
"8248719","8253379"," Absent that, hey, it's a little bit of a shambles in wealth management right now. "
"8253700","8254660"," They're trying to get their bearings."
"8255139","8256379"," They bought this United Capital."
"8256799","8258360"," It was a huge blow up, didn't work. "
"8259059","8262080"," Peter Malook stepped in to buy whatever was left of it."
"8262600","8264260"," I don't really know what their strategy is there."
"8264440","8265540"," They're trying to build a custodian. "
"8265840","8267760"," It's not the greatest business with free trading."
"8268360","8270000"," So you have that."
"8270000","8275860"," If you're not going to get a big invest banking boom, I don't really know what else you'd be in"
"8275860","8276420"," the stock for. "
"8276580","8277780"," I prefer Morgan Stanley."
"8278059","8283540"," They're kicking ass in wealth management and they're going to play in an IPO boom."
"8283719","8286480"," So if I could choose one or the other, I think MS over GS. "
"8286879","8289639"," JPM is the one you do own, the only one of the majors."
"8290379","8294840"," Way less reliant on big stock market booms."
"8294840","8298879"," JPM will play their number one or two in every category. "
"8299360","8304420"," They're not reliant upon it for earnings growth in the way that Goldman, Goldman's growth engine"
"8304420","8306719"," was supposed to be consumer fintech."
"8306940","8307459"," It didn't work."
"8307500","8308740"," They're exiting those businesses. "
"8309500","8310760"," I don't know what's behind it."
"8311040","8316760"," I do know if we're going to do another three or 400 IPOs, Goldman's going to do really well."
"8317100","8317500"," Are we?"
"8317959","8319219"," It's an open question to me. "
"8319340","8319920"," So I'm not sure."
"8320180","8320620"," Bill Adobe."
"8321059","8322459"," A couple of nice calls today. "
"8322459","8324719"," Reiterated by Jeff Ries, that's ahead of earnings."
"8325260","8326459"," The stock's had a great run."
"8326559","8333320"," They go 660 price target, also reiterated, Morgan Stanley, same price target, 660 bucks. "
"8334080","8336799"," This is the actual implementation of AI."
"8337459","8340480"," They're a firefly image generation tool."
"8341360","8342740"," That really starts to start. "
"8342959","8345040"," When they get that fully launched, that's going to be a great tell."
"8345240","8348940"," When you think about it, they got 20 million subscribers and a lot of data that's going to be"
"8348940","8349480"," pulled from there."
"8349480","8355260"," Between 2020 and 2022, 165 million creators hit the creator economy. "
"8355660","8358920"," There's a big market for Adobe to address within that."
"8359559","8365500"," And Morgan Stanley, Keith Weiss noted, they're on light on the numbers, but the vision is big."
"8365700","8367160"," I think that's what you got to take away here. "
"8367459","8368760"," The big, big vision."
"8369299","8370620"," And last year, it broke below $600."
"8371299","8372780"," It's badly at 600 bucks right now. "
"8372840","8374920"," The longer stays there, I think technical support kicks in too."
"8375059","8376360"," Comfortable with the 35 PE."
"8377000","8382059"," Listen, I mean, a software company, it's going to be technically a big hire of a PE, but you're"
"8382059","8384700"," paying for, you know, you're really paying for the vision. "
"8384980","8385559"," Oh, if you will."
"8385920","8388260"," Well, we'll see if the vision comes to fruition."
"8388580","8390400"," All right, Mike Santoli, he's next with his midday word. "
"8390540","8391080"," We're back after this."
"8396650","8399110"," Are you following the halftime report podcast?"
"8399870","8400770"," What are you waiting for?"
"8401430","8403310"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."
"8403810","8405550"," Follow the halftime podcast now. "
"8587720","8588840"," All right, we are back."
"8588980","8592880"," Our senior markets commentator Mike Santoli is on the desk for his midday word."
"8593100","8595700"," So, you know, we had a huge meal in November. "
"8596160","8597300"," We've gone through this digestion."
"8597980","8599000"," We thought we were still full."
"8599800","8602820"," And then somebody put a beautiful piece of AI cake in front of us today. "
"8603060","8603200"," Sure."
"8603540","8604720"," And we decided we couldn't resist."
"8605360","8606660"," For now, yeah, we're in a band. "
"8606940","8608120"," That's what's going on."
"8608220","8612680"," And there is always something idiosyncratic that usually has to get a market moving again."
"8612680","8617240"," Once we've been going sideways in this way for a while, it was saying earlier, 13 straight"
"8617240","8622360"," sessions, if today is included, where we finished within half a percent of 4550 in the SB. "
"8622640","8625800"," And yet within it, you know, the average stocks may be doing a little bit better."
"8626700","8629240"," I don't know that it has to be in either or market."
"8629500","8632340"," I know we got used to this idea that it's either a black or red. "
"8632500","8634220"," It's either a mega cap day or a Russell day."
"8634800","8636620"," They can go either direction from here."
"8636840","8643440"," You can see the market kind of unsure if we have the horses at this level to really carry us"
"8643440","8648500"," ahead without, I mean, maybe just waiting for the jobs number tomorrow to be absolutely perfect in"
"8648500","8651540"," Goldilocks, like every other number this week has been to see where we go. "
"8651680","8652360"," It reminds me a little bit."
"8652460","8657700"," I was looking back when we've gone flat after a rally like this for a long period of time."
"8657840","8662040"," And it really did happen in the spring after we got the huge lift off the SB below. "
"8662340","8663740"," And people about the Fed was going to be very easy."
"8663760","8665700"," Be careful of a liquidation break here."
"8665700","8669240"," I'm kind of chopping around before it could be a swift reversal down. "
"8672000","8675620"," I mean, yeah, people are saying that have some stops down below."
"8675660","8681280"," We can still squeeze up here, just be aware there could be a shakeout."
"8681440","8681640"," Okay. "
"8683420","8686280"," You guys hear the seasonal negatives on crude."
"8686300","8688740"," Maybe it's be aware of a shakeout here."
"8688740","8689100"," Okay. "
"8689800","8692260"," And a little bit of flattening of the one in five minute trigger."
"8693060","8697420"," You know that your real support is down on the half an hourly trigger."
"8697420","8703400"," Oftentimes when you get that cross of the of any triggers, like the one in five minutes or the half"
"8703400","8707480"," hour and one hour, we'll quickly go back and just test those things. "
"8707680","8712680"," So don't panic or have stops or have the ability to adjust."
"8712760","8714260"," Remember, trade fast, right?"
"8714620","8717180"," Dodge, dodge and weave, all that kind of stuff."
"8717560","8718600"," We're thinking it beyond that. "
"8718700","8723380"," As we discussed yesterday, I'm not convinced that some kind of scary macro signal yet."
"8723540","8727300"," Yeah, it's been an everything rally except for related to energy and oil."
"8727300","8728480"," I see I'm closing down. "
"8728880","8731000"," That's Mike Santoli, everything rally, including crypto."
"8731360","8732880"," That's been breaking out."
"8733320","8734660"," Burning some short sellers too. "
"8734800","8738780"," Our kinkrooney comes up next because she's following that money when we come back."
"8753830","8760330"," So I said at 12.50 p.m. Eastern time, we're expected to see the live stream of Bank of"
"8760330","8761650"," Canada's Corbelle speaking."
"8772540","8779840"," So the dollar continuing to head lower amidst bets that the Bank of Japan will scrap the world's"
"8779840","8783140"," last negative interest rate regime as soon as this month. "
"8783420","8790660"," So again, just sentiment from the news from overnight in the Asia session, continuing to get the"
"8790660","8791340"," dollar here."
"8793860","8803840"," And also the end, not letting"
"8803840","8805300"," up on its current strength."
"8896520","8906280"," Coin been on"
"8906280","8909520"," fire lately, as you know, soaring past 43,000. "
"8909640","8911740"," That's the highest level since early last year."
"8911860","8915920"," There it is 43.2. But that big breakout is burning some crypto short sellers."
"8916520","8918380"," Our kinkrooney is following that money for us, Kate. "
"8919100","8919540"," Hey, Scott."
"8919760","8925100"," So it's been a tough time lately to bet against some of the crypto proxy stocks as Bitcoin has"
"8925100","8925360"," risen."
"8925560","8927500"," You've got Coinbase and MicroStrategy in particular. "
"8927820","8930900"," Those have been some of the best performing tech names this year."
"8931000","8933580"," They're both up roughly 300 percent since January."
"8933580","8940300"," Data from S3 partners now showing that short sellers have lost more than $6 billion this year on"
"8940300","8941140"," crypto related bets. "
"8941380","8946200"," More than half of those losses came from Coinbase shorts became more of a popular trade this fall."
"8946280","8950180"," Short sellers increased exposure in September to what they thought was an overbought sector."
"8950180","8956060"," According to S3, short sellers are down $2.7 billion just in the past few months on those crypto"
"8956060","8957340"," trades or in percentage terms. "
"8957560","8959240"," That's off about 148 percent."
"8959540","8961560"," Part of this rally likely is short squeeze."
"8961760","8964700"," You also have individual traders now chasing some of this momentum. "
"8964700","8969620"," According to Vanda Research, individual traders started rotating out of some of the big tech names"
"8969620","8972740"," into crypto and small caps, which there's a bit of an overlap there."
"8972760","8977700"," Coinbase and MicroStrategy have benefited from these retail inflows, as well as some of the Bitcoin"
"8977700","8983120"," mining names to Vanda Analysts point to that upcoming January 10th deadline for the SEC's potential"
"8983120","8985980"," approval of a Bitcoin ETF causing a lot of this excitement."
"8986220","8991280"," They say being a very momentum driven asset class with a clear catalyst on the near term horizon is"
"8991280","8996440"," that we wouldn't be surprised if we see retail traders continue to pump flows into the space over"
"8996440","8996920"," the coming weeks. "
"8996920","8997660"," Scott, back to you."
"8997840","8998660"," Yeah, Kate, thank you."
"8998980","9000000"," You have a thought on this?"
"9000320","9005960"," Because FOMO has paid said anticipation of ETFs and it's just been going in that way. "
"9006340","9011360"," If you think you missed this and you want to play catch up, one under the radar way to do"
"9011360","9012100"," it would be Robinhood."
"9012560","9017600"," This is a stock that used to move tick by tick with crypto and there's been a disconnect."
"9018060","9024960"," But if you think about the main driver of profitable activity on the Robinhood platform, it is"
"9024960","9025240"," crypto. "
"9025760","9027280"," So this is a heavily shorted stock."
"9027640","9028440"," It's been out for the count."
"9028880","9030660"," It's rebound a little bit off it to your low. "
"9031220","9034480"," That might be a way in the stock market if you wanted to."
"9034480","9035780"," I don't want to."
"9035940","9038780"," I'm not putting this trade on, but it's just something that..."
"9038780","9043360"," What's the difference between liking the potential of what Robinhood could do?"
"9043440","9046480"," Because I'm more of a long-term investor. "
"9046700","9051060"," What I'm describing is a short-term phenomenon where this is a name that could run up into your end"
"9051060","9053940"," as everyone anticipates the first crypto ETF."
"9054720","9060480"," The big winners of their being a first crypto ETF, probably going to be Fidelity, BlackRock."
"9061120","9066120"," I don't really think there's a trade there, but it's a legitimization of the asset class in the"
"9066120","9067620"," eyes of Wall Street. "
"9068240","9073480"," And I think it does bring investors back into playing in this space."
"9074100","9074620"," And I think..."
"9074620","9076680"," Coinbase is quadrupled this year."
"9077480","9078120"," Robinhood has not. "
"9078380","9084240"," Coinbase obviously a much bigger player in crypto, but again, one of the big drivers of Robinhood"
"9084240","9086060"," activity is speculation."
"9086700","9088120"," And this is speculation writ large."
"9088740","9093160"," So if it's coming back, they'll be back to trading on the Robinhood platform. "
"9093460","9095300"," So what are your thoughts about the space right now?"
"9096920","9103320"," Yeah, I mean, I think if we get this ETF, obviously, to Josh's point, investors will say, if it's"
"9103320","9105020"," good enough for BlackRock, we want some of that."
"9105460","9110200"," I think where you kind of have the FOMO in that greater fool's theory is, from what I understand,"
"9110420","9114420"," which could be wrong, there's about 16 to 17 million Bitcoin in cold storage."
"9114420","9118380"," So that only leaves like five to six out there to trade. "
"9118600","9122580"," And so all of a sudden you have this scarcity of, and you have an ETF, which I don't really"
"9122580","9123280"," understand the math."
"9123460","9127740"," If you only have five or six million Bitcoin and you have an ETF, how do you actually back that"
"9127740","9128000"," up?"
"9128240","9132380"," I get it on gold, but I think right now going into the year end and going into January, you're"
"9132380","9134360"," going to definitely FOMO is alive and well."
"9134720","9137980"," And I will say, you know, this crypto community wins again. "
"9138080","9139140"," It's pretty incredible."
"9139520","9142060"," After what happened last year with FTX, Voyager, etc."
"9142060","9146220"," All the ones that stayed out of jail get to win. "
"9146440","9148500"," The key was you had to not go to jail."
"9148940","9151540"," And if you survive that, you get to win again."
"9153620","9155540"," We'll do final trades on the other side of this break. "
"9312250","9313330"," Two cents up, 10."
"9314830","9315810"," That's a tiny more bell."
"9316170","9316870"," It's funny speaking. "
"9317090","9318030"," It's going to be a nice thing."
"9472830","9479450"," Angel.com I hope you're watching me closing the bell today, three o'clock, because we got Tom Lee."
"9480950","9484930"," Tom Lee, when you think of bulls, who do you think of Josh Brown?"
"9485370","9486230"," Only Tom Lee. "
"9486430","9486990"," Only Tom Lee."
"9487150","9487670"," Ray owns it."
"9487790","9488170"," That's his lane. "
"9488370","9488630"," All right."
"9488930","9491610"," Well, let's see what he has to say about the year."
"9491750","9492930"," Oh, Jimmy Lee's been thought to. "
"9493630","9495370"," That's true, but Tom Lee is kind of in a class."
"9495830","9496870"," Uber bull himself, right?"
"9497070","9497230"," Uber bull."
"9497470","9497590"," Yeah. "
"9498150","9499230"," You think of bears, who do you think of?"
"9499230","9502650"," Oh, I don't know."
"9502710","9503650"," I forget their names these days."
"9503770","9504010"," Mike Wilson. "
"9504190","9504730"," Are they still out there?"
"9505370","9505950"," I'm just kidding."
"9507350","9507930"," He's that one."
"9508250","9508590"," All right. "
"9508750","9511230"," Well, I hope you'll join us at three o'clock on closing bell."
"9511810","9512730"," Brandon, you have a final trade?"
"9515450","9518810"," Yeah, JPQ owns the keys and sells calls against it."
"9518950","9522510"," So if you miss the run up in these names and you think they're going to do well next year,"
"9522950","9527230"," JPQ, if you think they're going to be flat, you have about an 11% covered call premium. "
"9527230","9529450"," And so you can earn some income while you're waiting."
"9529750","9530110"," All right."
"9530270","9532230"," By the way, we're going to run you up to Broadcom earnings too. "
"9532630","9536630"," I want to let everybody know about that, which are going to be significant after the bell."
"9536790","9537950"," What you got final trade, Bill Baruch."
"9538350","9542970"," Ab V, if the SAP's going to set a new high without the MAG 7, it's going to be names"
"9542970","9545010"," like this, financials and health care. "
"9545250","9546510"," I'm going to be driving it now."
"9546570","9550750"," They're replacing the Humera pipeline within their pipeline adding to things."
"9551010","9553590"," And it's a hated name by mutual funds and hedge funds. "
"9553830","9555110"," Hedge funds are short this name."
"9555110","9559010"," That could really dry this to new highs and have the JB."
"9559190","9562090"," Staying long AMD, I should probably sell, but I'm not. "
"9562430","9563350"," So there we are."
"9563590","9564950"," It's up 8% as you speak."
"9565170","9566570"," All right, that's for us. "
"9566710","9567710"," I'll see you on closely about the exchange."
"9567710","9569210"," That's about $5 billion in December."
"9569750","9574330"," Thank you very much, Scott. "
"9574610","9575450"," And welcome to the exchange."
"9576150","9576670"," I'm Kelly Evans."
"9576950","9577710"," And here's what's ahead. "
"9578310","9582450"," Banielts have dropped sharply in recent weeks, but our guest says not so fast."
"9582450","9587790"," He thinks the tenure is headed back over 5% next year and is in the no-landing camp on"
"9587790","9588390"," the economy."
"9588730","9590650"," We'll debate ahead of tomorrow's based job tomorrow. "
"9591310","9595250"," Plus airline stocks rebounding today, but it's been a disappointing few months for many of them."
"9595550","9598330"," And yet one supplier is hitting its highest levels of the year."
"9598810","9600750"," That CEO joins us in an exclusive ahead. "
"9601250","9605890"," And there are two housing stocks our analysts are especially well-positioned into the new year."
"9606310","9607350"," And he's the name you can trust."
"9607770","9610450"," He's got the names and how much upside he sees ahead. "
"9610450","9612470"," Before all that, let's start with the markets."
"9612590","9615470"," Dom Q has our read and our numbers and the momentum."
"9615830","9616910"," And what do you make of it all Dom?"
"9617110","9621310"," The momentum has been in certain parts of the market, Kelly, and specifically within technology"
"9621310","9621730"," stocks. "
"9621910","9626370"," And that's the reason why you have the NASDAQ composite, the NASDAQ 100, the large cap names."
"9626610","9628110"," And they're really doing a lot of the heavy lifting."
"9628750","9632270"," It's green across the screen right now, but it wasn't like that during this morning. "
"9632270","9633470"," It was a very mixed trade."
"9633710","9636170"," But as things stands, I mentioned the NASDAQ composite."
"9636730","9639110"," It's up nearly 200 points, 190 points to the upside. "
"9639110","9641810"," One and a third percent gains, 14,337."
"9642690","9648150"," The Dow industrial is the real laggard, only up one quarter of one percent or 92 points, 36,146."
"9648750","9653470"," And the S&P 500, that broader measure of the stock market, 45, 85 is the last trade. "
"9653630","9656990"," They're up about 36, 37 points, three quarters of one percent gain."
"9657190","9661830"," This, by the way, would represent just around session highs at this point, at the highs of the"
"9661830","9663690"," session just about up 37 to the downside."
"9664290","9669770"," Well, if I could write on there, it would say 37 points, 16 points to the upside on the lower"
"9669770","9670290"," end of things. "
"9670470","9671130"," We'll keep an eye on that."
"9671370","9676630"," Oil prices also trying to find some positivity right now, trying to not to work off towards a six"
"9676630","9677930"," day losing streak."
"9678330","9682050"," As you can see just about flat on the session right now, still below $70 per barrel for US"
"9682050","9687970"," benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, $69.35. The level that a lot of folks are still watching right"
"9687970","9689190"," now is $78. "
"9689530","9690450"," That's right there."
"9690570","9695770"," As you can see, that $78 mark is where that long term 200-day moving average is."
"9695890","9696890"," So keep an eye on crude prices. "
"9696890","9701630"," Remember, it was supply concerns for gasoline yesterday that drove a good amount of the downside,"
"9702170","9703830"," trying to find some bit of stability today."
"9704370","9705890"," And then Kelly mentioned the airline stocks."
"9706390","9708350"," Let me show you just how strong they are today. "
"9708530","9711170"," They're among some of the biggest gainers overall in the market."
"9711550","9717150"," Now, JetBlue Airways, up 13 percent, they updated their fourth quarter and full year sales growth"
"9717150","9719530"," guidance better than it was prior."
"9720230","9721770"," And so that's helping that particular move. "
"9722070","9725790"," And by the way, they're saying holiday travel trends better than they thought they were going to"
"9725790","9725890"," be."
"9725890","9726990"," So that's a big deal."
"9727350","9732850"," Southwest Air Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, among the S&P 500 airline stocks"
"9732850","9734330"," that are catching a bid because of that. "
"9734470","9735450"," So keep an eye on those airline stocks."
"9735630","9739970"," And Kelly, I know you're going to be talking much more about that aircraft trade later on this"
"9739970","9740190"," show."
"9740570","9742290"," Indeed, Dom, thank you very much. "
"9742290","9743090"," Our Dominic Q."
"9743490","9746530"," Well, has the dropping yields gone too far, too fast?"
"9746970","9750790"," The 10-year yield is down nearly a full percentage point since hitting a 16-year high."
"9751330","9755350"," The TLT Treasury Bond ETF has surged 16% in less than two months."
"9755350","9759810"," And in fact, November's nine and a half percent gain is its best month since the start of the"
"9759810","9760310"," pandemic. "
"9760550","9764630"," The ETF on track to post back-to-back positive months for only the second time in two years."
"9765250","9768150"," But have investors gotten carried away with Fed rate cut hopes?"
"9768570","9770350"," Steve Leasman is here with a closer look."
"9770590","9770690"," Steve?"
"9772610","9773310"," Hey, Kelly. "
"9773610","9779010"," Yeah, just weeks after that 10-year hit 5% and markets worried could the government fund its"
"9779010","9779290"," deficit?"
"9780050","9782230"," Bonds have rallied and yields have fallen."
"9782370","9784650"," And what has been the biggest bond boom of the year?"
"9785350","9787370"," The opposite of what happened several weeks ago."
"9787610","9791630"," The other than the 10-year, it's fallen 87 basis points since the mid-October. "
"9791890","9793050"," Touch near 5%."
"9793470","9798630"," And 37 of those 87, they've come just since Thanksgiving, which wasn't all that long ago."
"9799070","9799830"," What's at play here?"
"9799990","9803490"," Well, better inflation data, including that decline in oil that Dom was talking about. "
"9804010","9805770"," Repricing of the Fed and Fed rate cuts."
"9805990","9806930"," Talk more about that in a second."
"9807590","9808610"," Hedge funds covering shorts. "
"9808910","9810050"," Everybody was sure was going higher."
"9810370","9810770"," They were wrong."
"9811330","9814550"," Then pension funds and insurance companies come in to lock in those longer rates. "
"9814550","9816430"," Driven apart by the growing belief."
"9816570","9819210"," The Fed is done hiking and it's going to cut."
"9819710","9820570"," Take a look at that. "
"9820670","9824030"," In mid-October, the market was priced for about 70 basis points of cuts this year."
"9824690","9829930"," That is nearly doubled with 130, actually 134 basis points of cuts now built into the futures"
"9829930","9833270"," markets, beginning, by the way, as soon as the March meeting."
"9833550","9837670"," Rick Reeder, though, from BlackRock, he tells me, I think the front end is over its keys. "
"9838430","9839810"," I don't think they're going to ease in March."
"9840030","9840970"," So that's something to think about."
"9841090","9842010"," Here's something else to think about. "
"9842250","9847330"," Markets are going to watch carefully another round of massive treasury options next week after poor"
"9847330","9847930"," auction results."
"9848210","9850350"," Let's stock sell-offs a few months ago."
"9850610","9852650"," Three and six month bills, 143 billion. "
"9852690","9855910"," You got your three-year notes, your 10-year notes, your 30-year bonds."
"9856590","9858310"," Wait for Santelli's grade on those."
"9858530","9859290"," That's going to be important. "
"9859490","9865250"," For now, it seems lower inflation, hedge funds short covering, and a belief in deep rate cuts by"
"9865250","9870030"," the Fed next year is going to come fierce about how the government funds the $33 trillion deficit."
"9870350","9875790"," But tomorrow's jobs number if it comes in strong, could challenge the rate cut hypothesis and"
"9875790","9876210"," enthusiasm."
"9876210","9882590"," And some also expect, Kelly, Fed Chair Jay Powell, next week to push back on the rate cut pricing,"
"9883050","9884170"," which has fueled this bond rally. "
"9884510","9887350"," So we have those bond auctions next week, and we're going to hear from him."
"9887510","9890150"," This is a rocks decision, it comes with inframical joint efforts."
"9890350","9892770"," All in one week, all one package. "
"9892770","9894310"," You got your jobs report tomorrow."
"9894590","9899670"," So don't go anywhere, because you got to keep CNBC on here."
"9899810","9900950"," You got jobs tomorrow. "
"9900950","9903430"," You got three big bond auctions next week."
"9903690","9904930"," And you got Fed Chair Jay Powell."
"9905390","9907810"," Don't forget the Sea of the Sea Fed survey comes on Tuesday. "
"9908530","9909810"," That's on the calendar too."
"9910090","9911070"," Steve, stay with us."
"9911210","9911910"," We appreciate it. "
"9912170","9916410"," As we debate where bonds could go from here, one of my next guest warns that yields will shoot"
"9916410","9917330"," higher next year."
"9917670","9921250"," Let's bring in Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, and Nancy Tangler."
"9921290","9924670"," She's here on set with me, and she's CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Laffer Tangler"
"9924670","9924850"," Investments. "
"9925510","9926650"," Welcome to everybody."
"9927010","9931390"," Jim, you can just tee things off here with what's becoming, what was a consensus call maybe a month"
"9931390","9933070"," ago, and suddenly is out of consensus."
"9933510","9937090"," But you're sticking with this idea that bond yields could yet go higher. "
"9938250","9943870"," Yeah, I've been that way for three years, and I don't think that the move that we've had right now"
"9943870","9944350"," is over."
"9944710","9946850"," I actually think we're in a multi-year bear market in bonds."
"9947170","9948350"," It started in 2020. "
"9949310","9954050"," Usually you get a recession or a serious downturn in the economy, because something breaks."
"9955070","9959790"," Either it's spiking crude oil prices or a pandemic or a financial crisis or something like that."
"9960170","9964090"," This time around, everybody thinks the thing that's going to break the economy is high rates. "
"9964810","9968130"," But more and more, the evidence is high rates are a drag on the economy."
"9968330","9970110"," They're not helpful in some areas."
"9970570","9974350"," But they are helpful in other areas because of interest income, and I don't think it breaks it. "
"9974690","9978630"," So I think what we're going to see for the economy, for 24, is what we saw in 23."
"9979310","9983250"," We'll churn out 2%, 2.5% dot quarters like we have been."
"9983690","9986010"," I don't think inflation makes it all the way to 2%. "
"9986010","9987630"," We'll give strong nominal growth."
"9987870","9992530"," And I think that bond yields could probably see 5.5% somewhere in 2024."
"9992670","9999410"," So the move down so far has been surprising and painful if you've been on the bear side, like I"
"9999410","9999650"," have. "
"10000010","10002530"," But I still think the broader trend is still higher for rates."
"10002830","10007710"," Nancy, it's one of these things with the macro, where you could almost completely ignore it, except"
"10007710","10009310"," for all of the extremes that we've been through."
"10009630","10012430"," Even the bond move has been dizzying for a lot of investors. "
"10012810","10014870"," Where does it leave you kind of positioned into next year?"
"10014870","10018210"," Well, I certainly agree with Jim's view in 2020."
"10018290","10021270"," We argued then that bonds were riskier than stocks."
"10021890","10027590"," But now I'm drawing an analogy to the 1990s when I was not only alive, but I was managing other"
"10027590","10028290"," people's money. "
"10028850","10030570"," And there's a lot of similarities."
"10030870","10034490"," And you don't really need to see rates go lower."
"10034790","10038430"," We were at 5% to 8% on the tenure during the entire decade. "
"10038710","10038830"," Wow."
"10038990","10040890"," We don't need to see inflation go back to 2%."
"10040890","10041630"," And I agree with Jim. "
"10041730","10042290"," I don't think it will."
"10042850","10043890"," We were at 3%."
"10043890","10047290"," There was an inverted yield curve, a soft landing, a war, a recession. "
"10047450","10049390"," I mean, there was just everything that you needed."
"10049710","10055670"," And one of the most important things was the VIX stayed under 18 for most of the decade while the"
"10055670","10056490"," stock market roared."
"10057070","10057990"," So I think we're slowing. "
"10058550","10063010"," I don't know that we're going to get a recession, but I want to own those reliable growers going"
"10063010","10064490"," into a slowing economic environment."
"10064710","10068450"," I was reading some trader commentary this morning, and the tech traders kind of have their head in"
"10068450","10068770"," their hands."
"10068910","10073110"," Now, maybe today a little bit different story, but we haven't really seen the performance from the"
"10073110","10075810"," MAG7, for instance, that we were able to rely on. "
"10075970","10078110"," Does that affect you that much?"
"10078330","10081470"," Or is that some take it as a healthy sign into next year?"
"10081850","10082670"," I think it's both."
"10082970","10087390"," I think you want to use the weakness, the recent weakness, and if we get further weakness to add to"
"10087390","10092090"," those names, because the generative AI total addressable market, I just gave a presentation on the"
"10092090","10093670"," fourth industrial revolution."
"10094150","10096490"," You need to own these stocks in your portfolio. "
"10097130","10101310"," If the market broadens out, I mean, that's good for every portfolio manager because we have to be"
"10101310","10101930"," diversified."
"10102470","10107650"," So I think our theme is old economy companies that are embracing the digital revolution, generative"
"10107650","10111470"," AI cloud computing, and then the suppliers of the tools you need to get there."
"10111470","10112530"," But you're sticking with Microsoft. "
"10112590","10113690"," You're sticking with Adobe."
"10113690","10115930"," You're sticking with Broadcom names like that."
"10116010","10116090"," Yeah. "
"10116330","10117950"," Well, Broadcom's reporting today."
"10118050","10119390"," So I'm going to head to myself."
"10119650","10123150"," If it goes up, it's one of our largest holding if it goes down, you want to buy more. "
"10123490","10127390"," It's the poor man's Nvidia, and I think you want to own that stock."
"10127650","10132730"," Well, Jim, let me turn back to this discussion about bond yields because in one of the things you"
"10132730","10135050"," described is that you're in this no landing camp."
"10135750","10138270"," And certainly this year, the recession never came. "
"10138970","10142830"," There were times we had the June rise in jobless claims that made it look imminent and then that"
"10142830","10143190"," went away."
"10143330","10147330"," We do have this rise in the unemployment rate, but if tomorrow is really strong, maybe that goes"
"10147330","10147650"," away."
"10148210","10154110"," So how important is that that we just have a continually expanding economy in order for us to get"
"10154110","10155690"," bonds behaving like you described?"
"10156830","10161170"," Well, I think that's central to the whole argument here is that the no landing camp is just an"
"10161170","10161490"," expansion. "
"10161870","10163890"," We just continue to expand on the economy."
"10164450","10166030"," It's not the soft landing camp."
"10166150","10168550"," I've been critical of soft landings because it doesn't have a definition. "
"10168750","10170450"," I don't know what exactly it means."
"10171010","10174030"," And you could actually argue we've never ever had one, a soft landing."
"10174610","10183510"," So if labor continues to show the strength that it has, 220,000 initial claims today, it's"
"10183510","10185270"," historically a very low number. "
"10185710","10188790"," We're still under 4% on the unemployment rate."
"10189590","10194390"," Then I think it really does augur this argument that the labor market is healthy."
"10195070","10198410"," I think a lot of employees feel good about the labor market. "
"10198590","10202110"," That's why we've seen labor hoarding and we've seen a lot of turnover."
"10202490","10207250"," The quits rate is still very elevated from where it was pre-pandemic, meaning people are willing to"
"10207250","10211490"," quit their job and take another job or quit their job because they're comfortable they're going to"
"10211490","10212010"," get employed."
"10212710","10213910"," And if they're comfortable, they're going to get employed. "
"10213910","10215010"," They keep spending."
"10215550","10219890"," So I know we've always focused on excess savings, but I really think it's more about labor"
"10219890","10221910"," confidence that's got the spending going."
"10221910","10227770"," And that's why the economy confounds everybody by never quite making it to a recession, even though"
"10227770","10228970"," it kind of bounces around. "
"10231630","10234330"," So I agree with a lot of what Jim has said."
"10234490","10240030"," And I think Jim is bringing a sort of economic view to the discussion that's sorely lacking among"
"10240030","10245090"," many people, which is that, hey, if the government's going to spend all this money on debt, it's"
"10245090","10248910"," going to be giving the money to somebody and that money gets back into the economy."
"10249150","10254610"," The other thing I think that Jim does well is this notion that everybody's been focused on this"
"10254610","10258730"," savings thing and nobody's really been focused on the idea that so many people are employed to"
"10258730","10261150"," bring home paychecks as central to the outcome. "
"10261610","10263490"," I think I pushed back a little bit on Jim."
"10263870","10267690"," When I think about five and a half percent on the tenure, now maybe you're saying it just gets"
"10267690","10268030"," there."
"10268030","10274090"," I'm just not sure if we end up being in an environment of, say, steady inflation in the two to"
"10274090","10279790"," two and a half percent range, not 100% sure why you would have long bonds at five and a"
"10279790","10280390"," half percent. "
"10280730","10283250"," Maybe that's a long-term cost of funds or a real rate."
"10283570","10287890"," Or are you saying, Jim, I guess my question is, that there's still an issue with the government"
"10287890","10293890"," funding this enormous amount of debt, for which investors are requiring a premium in order to fund"
"10293890","10294030"," it."
"10294990","10296890"," A little bit of all of the above. "
"10297390","10300890"," The way I ride at five and a half percent is I think we're going to be like two to"
"10300890","10303270"," two and a half percent on real growth."
"10303630","10306190"," That's what we were in 23, continuing in the 24."
"10306850","10309110"," I'm a little bit more hawkish on inflation. "
"10309530","10312350"," I think that the bottom on inflation is around three percent."
"10312490","10314350"," I'm talking core course at four now."
"10314850","10316030"," It bottoms somewhere around three. "
"10316470","10318450"," Add those two together and you're a little bit above five."
"10319050","10320630"," That's nominal GDP growth."
"10320890","10322190"," That's inflation plus real. "
"10322990","10326990"," Typically interest rates should trade around the nominal GDP level."
"10327570","10331330"," And yes, I'm going to put a little bit of a premium on it because of the big budget deficits"
"10331330","10333130"," and the amount of funding that we have to do."
"10333490","10335530"," And that's how I arrive at five and a half percent. "
"10335930","10341270"," Now, if the economy is weaker than I think, if inflation is weaker than I think, or the budget"
"10341270","10344570"," deficit or tax receipts coming stronger, I'll adjust it along the way."
"10344710","10347070"," But right now, I feel very confident in that number."
"10347330","10350750"," Does that real quickly, Jim, not that we usually talk to you about your equity calls, but I mean,"
"10351050","10352470"," you are constructive on the economy. "
"10352470","10354290"," So does that leave you also bullish on stocks?"
"10355530","10360910"," Who a point in the point is, I think people have to recognize, Dr. Jeremy Siegel wrote a book,"
"10361170","10361930"," Stocks for Long Run."
"10362030","10363310"," He put out a new edition this year."
"10363950","10364590"," Summarize it. "
"10364910","10368090"," The long-term prospect for stocks is around eight percent."
"10368690","10373330"," If I could get five in a money market fund, I'm getting two thirds of the stock market with no"
"10373330","10373990"," market risk."
"10374750","10378690"," What is it going to take me to take that final third, leave for that final third?"
"10379050","10382710"," This is far different to 2019 when I was getting zero in a money market fund. "
"10382710","10388350"," I think the competition of higher rates is going to continue to be a problem for the stock market."
"10388610","10390130"," It's one of the favorites of stock picking."
"10390290","10391790"," I think that's coming back in the vote. "
"10391990","10396550"," Now, Peter Lynch can come out of retirement because we're no longer going to be picking broad-based"
"10396550","10397110"," ETFs."
"10397150","10398370"," We're going to be picking individual stocks."
"10398550","10402030"," Well, except that he would become an advertisement for 20 years based on how often we've heard that"
"10402030","10404530"," it's going to be the year that that matters. "
"10404890","10405990"," I'll give you the last word, Nancy."
"10406930","10410690"," Oh, listen, I think the job market has started to show weakness."
"10410690","10416210"," I also think the consumer is strong because most people are working, but also they spend out of"
"10416210","10416750"," their net worth. "
"10417070","10420270"," And the baby boomer generation has half of the nation's net worth."
"10420610","10421570"," They are still spending."
"10421890","10424870"," That said, we are seeing some cracks in labor. "
"10425410","10432230"," I think we're going to continue to see industrials kind of bottom out here with the PMIs."
"10432610","10435870"," And then I think you have an opportunity for a really strong market."
"10436030","10437370"," So I would disagree with Jim on that. "
"10437450","10442370"," I do think you want to own stocks here, even with a 5% money market rate, if he's right."
"10442590","10446990"," Or even with cracks in the economy that you describe, isn't usually the time to get a little"
"10446990","10447290"," cautious."
"10447830","10449470"," It is, but I think we're in a different..."
"10449470","10452330"," I mean, everything about this whole cycle has been different. "
"10452850","10455790"," And so we are working off of the pandemic excesses."
"10456050","10457430"," And I think you have to step back."
"10457610","10461370"," And it is a stock picker's market for sure, which is why I think you want to be focused on"
"10461370","10461830"," technology. "
"10462430","10466730"," I think you want to own industrials overweight because they tend to do well as the PMIs are"
"10466730","10467130"," bottoming."
"10467130","10472830"," And then I think you have to just pick great names within each of the other sectors based on our"
"10472830","10473030"," theme."
"10473250","10478390"," We're buying companies that are using digitization to improve margins, generative AI, to improve"
"10478390","10479090"," product development. "
"10479730","10481270"," And so that's where we're making our bets."
"10481610","10483210"," All right, McDonald's, Domino's."
"10483290","10487070"," I mean, everywhere I look lately, these are examples of the ones trying to adopt it. "
"10487430","10487850"," We'll leave it there."
"10488070","10488570"," Thank you all today."
"10488610","10489290"," We appreciate it. "
"10489390","10491910"," Nancy Tangler, Jim Bianco, and our own Steve Leesman."
"10492310","10493390"," Now to the labor market."
"10493610","10497390"," On the eve of tomorrow's big job support, we learned this morning new jobless claims remain at"
"10497390","10501390"," levels consistent with a strong number before we moving average on continuing claims. "
"10501390","10504890"," It's kind of bubbling in two years, but it also retreated somewhat last week."
"10505330","10507170"," So is the labor market still going strong?"
"10507390","10509450"," Let's ask the recruiter.com chairman Evan Stone."
"10510970","10515530"," Evan, you know, in some ways the trend from a 30,000 foot point of view should seem obvious. "
"10515710","10517030"," The labor market is slowing."
"10517390","10522150"," And yet it seems it's not slowing enough that it really is making that much of a difference right"
"10522150","10522370"," now."
"10522490","10523370"," Our real time service. "
"10523370","10525350"," Yeah, well, good to see you again."
"10525610","10530210"," Look, I think the segment you just had talked about candidate sentiment, and we saw the same thing."
"10530250","10536910"," For the second month in a row, the candidate sentiment increased to 3.5 out of 5."
"10537270","10543550"," So a year ago is at 3.7. So that means that candidates are feeling okay, leaving one job for"
"10543550","10543850"," another. "
"10544110","10549310"," At the same time, recruiter sentiment is down to 2.7 out of out of 5, a low on the"
"10549310","10553370"," recruiter sentiment, a sort of this leading indicator for where things are actually happening."
"10554050","10557770"," So we also saw from the Joel report about 8% fewer job openings."
"10558050","10559110"," So there are fewer job openings. "
"10559610","10564410"," There's more volume, as you just showed, for those fewer jobs with less compensation."
"10564730","10568130"," Compensation is not increasing as much as it was certainly a year ago."
"10568370","10574030"," So that's making the recruiters really their sentiment be at an all-time low relative to the"
"10574030","10574610"," overall year. "
"10574810","10579790"," But as you just said in the last segment, you're seeing a very consistent quit rate that's higher"
"10579790","10581110"," than pre-pandemic levels."
"10581110","10582850"," And a higher rate that's also consistent."
"10583570","10584010"," Interesting. "
"10584350","10587870"," So this is a bit of a divergence or something new."
"10588010","10592110"," Recruiter sentiment, lowest of the year, 2.7 out of 5."
"10592690","10596910"," A serious decrease in open jobs, driving an increase in application volume."
"10597290","10599910"," So more work for fewer open jobs. "
"10600310","10604570"," And interestingly, also point out, only 11% of them saw an increase in compensation."
"10605610","10606330"," That's right."
"10606630","10612650"," So the days of higher at any cost and just get people and get people filled the seats. "
"10612910","10613350"," That's over."
"10613730","10617490"," Yet, as we just learned, candidates still are comfortable leaving their jobs."
"10617710","10619070"," So they're comfortable they could find a job. "
"10619270","10620670"," They're more comfortable than they were in the past."
"10621070","10622890"," But it's at a less of a compensation level."
"10623230","10623470"," Yeah. "
"10623950","10625750"," What does this point to you then?"
"10626690","10631010"," Again, the kind of the pain trade tomorrow, I think is a strong number, right?"
"10631190","10635370"," That kind of upends what's been going on with bonds since yields higher again and all the rest of"
"10635370","10635430"," it."
"10635590","10639310"," But if we stay on trend, then it sounds like the trend is that we've been slowing."
"10640690","10641310"," That's correct. "
"10641630","10645910"," And you look at, in the Aura report, we talked about this last month, the Aura report on job"
"10645910","10646330"," trends."
"10647270","10649650"," The top industries were actually staffing and recruiting."
"10650290","10651670"," So that's a good sign for the future. "
"10652250","10655090"," When companies start hiring more recruiters, they're looking for the future."
"10655730","10661650"," But you start to see downturns in other sectors, like computer and in the software side."

"10664890","10668070"," And obviously, healthcare has always been a very strong sector as well."
"10668070","10676170"," We saw a 70% increase, almost 70% increase in AI-related jobs in the financial sector month over"
"10676170","10676490"," month."
"10676710","10679810"," So more jobs in the financial sector looking at AI. "
"10680410","10684950"," And that's not just customer support, but it's customer support, it's analysis, it's regulations."
"10685810","10688330"," It's really across an entire financial services portfolio."
"10689190","10695350"," And that might be pointing to, as we've talked about sort of this rolling layoff side, these"
"10695350","10700970"," rolling layoffs, financial services might see more of those sometime in 24 as the benefits of AI"
"10700970","10705270"," affect the overall label market, obviously lowering up X as well. "
"10706650","10708410"," We'll hear a lot more about that, I imagine."
"10708730","10711790"," I would be interesting to get the CEOs to take as well, kind of talk to us a little bit"
"10711790","10713450"," about what they're doing and what they're seeing."
"10714270","10715090"," Evan, thanks for your time. "
"10715110","10715770"," We appreciate it."
"10716610","10717450"," Thanks so much, Kelly."

"10928650","10929930"," Welcome back to the Exchange."
"10930450","10935130"," As airlines try to add capacity to keep up with demand, air leasing company AirCap is uniquely"
"10935130","10938990"," positioned to take advantage of the rebound in travel and the lack of aircraft supply."
"10939710","10941730"," And it's pushing the stock toward a new all-time high. "
"10942070","10944970"," Philippo joins us now with the CEO of AirCap, Gus Kelly."
"10945250","10946150"," Phil and Gus, welcome."
"10947830","10948470"," Thank you, Kelly. "
"10949030","10950450"," Gus, I appreciate you joining us today."
"10950750","10955290"," I'm curious, you heard Kelly set up there and you're seeing what's happening in terms of demand"
"10955290","10955930"," around the world."
"10956310","10960750"," What's your take as you look into 2024, especially when it comes to international travel?"
"10962470","10963910"," Phil, it's good to be on. "
"10964210","10966430"," It's pretty robust all around the world."
"10966950","10971790"," When it comes to international traffic out of the US, the biggest market in the world, the most"
"10971790","10973610"," lucrative is the North Atlantic market."
"10974570","10975670"," And that's still booming. "
"10976010","10984070"," We don't see that changing, but Phil, a real driver of airline profitability for the medium term is"
"10984070","10986050"," going to be the supply environment."
"10986630","10991710"," The worst enemy of the airlines is too many seats, chasing too few passengers."
"10992370","10998130"," And so long as we have more passengers, and then we have seats, things are going to be fine. "
"10998950","11004770"," And the issues that the industry faces because of the production problems with Boeing, with Airbus,"
"11005710","11013030"," and then the durability of the airplanes when they get into service is, in my view, going to result"
"11013030","11015210"," in supply shortages for the rest of the decade."
"11017390","11022630"," You think the rest of this decade, we see a supply shortage, even as we start to gradually see an"
"11022630","11025030"," increase in production from Boeing and from Airbus."
"11026690","11029050"," Well, Phil, they will produce more aircraft. "
"11030530","11037710"," Now, since 2018, if you just took 2018 as the regular-weight production level of Boeing and Airbus,"
"11038350","11044330"," we're almost 3,000 aircraft light of that over what they've managed to produce in the last five"
"11044330","11044630"," years."
"11044830","11050550"," So if they had kept 2018 production levels throughout the last five years, there'd be 3,000 more"
"11050550","11051450"," aircraft in the world."
"11051980","11056110"," Bear in mind, Boeing and Airbus will only make it by 1,200 aircraft a year. "
"11056730","11064950"," So even when they do get back to those levels of production, the challenge that faces the industry"
"11064950","11067030"," is the technology of these aircraft."
"11068280","11070850"," The aircraft and the engines just do nuts."
"11071790","11072890"," Say that again, Phil?"
"11073830","11075570"," I'm sorry to interrupt you there, Angus. "
"11075730","11076930"," Are you comfortable with that technology?"
"11077570","11082850"," Or are you saying, even as you see advancements in things like fuel efficiency and lower emissions,"
"11083610","11086330"," the technology is just not developing fast enough?"
"11087410","11089090"," It's not durable enough, Phil."
"11089230","11090050"," It will get better."
"11090270","11096750"," But the problem is when the engines come off-wing faster than anyone expected, the network isn't"
"11096750","11101470"," there to repair these engines, the parts aren't there to repair them, the spare engines aren't"
"11101470","11101650"," there. "
"11102210","11107110"," So at a simple level, historically, you might've needed 10 aircraft to fly a circuit route."
"11107670","11108510"," Now you need 11."
"11108990","11114590"," And in aircraft's position, we are the largest owner of aircraft in the world by a country mild, to"
"11114590","11118350"," be honest, we're the largest owner of spare engines in the world. "
"11118610","11123690"," And we've seen significant increases in aircraft values, lease rates."
"11124410","11129350"," And the way the airlines are reacting, Phil, is what they're doing is they're saying to me, we need"
"11129350","11134130"," to hold onto these older aircraft for much longer than we ever thought."
"11134130","11139930"," Because we cannot rely on the durability of the new technology assets. "
"11140570","11145930"," And it's gonna be a long time before Boeing and Airbus get back to the levels of production they"
"11145930","11146210"," want."
"11146670","11150150"," So we see that lasting, as I said, for the best part of the rest of this decade."
"11150570","11151770"," That's fascinating, Gus. "
"11151930","11155070"," If I can just jump in and ask you one question, maybe it's relevant, maybe it's not."
"11155730","11159430"," You know, we are in the middle of finding out what's gonna happen with the JetBlue Spirit merger,"
"11160050","11160850"," Hawaiian and Alaska."
"11161410","11164590"," How does, do you have a kind of a take on the consolidation?"
"11165070","11168770"," Does it overall lead to more demand for planes or less?"
"11171350","11178090"," Yeah, I don't think it'll move demand for aircraft much, but I think it'll make the airlines"
"11178090","11179070"," stronger. "
"11179830","11185970"," Airlines are so capital intensive, such a massive operating leverage that scale is vital."
"11186750","11193590"," And if you're sub-scale airlines, it's hard to compete with the really big players in the industry."
"11194350","11198410"," So that would be what I'd say more Kelly, is that I think the benefits of the mergers of the"
"11198410","11203210"," consumer are that there is more staying power. "
"11203390","11208010"," There's airlines that can compete with the foreign comets here in the US market at any rate."
"11210030","11214410"," Gus, I'm curious from your perspective and what are you hearing from your customers when it comes"
"11214410","11218710"," to the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine issues?"
"11218990","11223950"," As Pratt & Whitney tries to work through that, a number of these engines have come off the plane,"
"11224570","11227070"," they gotta be repaired, but it's gonna take some time."
"11227430","11233510"," How much is that impacting your customers in terms of their networks and their operations?"
"11235590","11237890"," Phil, there's significant impacts. "
"11238830","11244150"," So first of all, you're gonna have a lot of aircraft on the ground next year."
"11244150","11249750"," These are expensive machines, $60 million machines, pilot costs, a lot of fixed costs in the"
"11249750","11250910"," airline around those aircraft."
"11251850","11257770"," And they're not gonna get delivery of the ones that they had expected to get, but from our"
"11257770","11262210"," perspective, what we see, the real solution here is that Pratt & Whitney, I believe, they will fix"
"11262210","11264810"," this issue, but it's gonna take a long time. "
"11265370","11266910"," And it's gonna be a bumpy ride."
"11267690","11274010"," So what needs to happen for the airlines in the next few years is that Airbus and Pratt & Whitney"
"11274010","11279710"," have to sit down and say, we are just not gonna be able to deliver as many airplanes as you"
"11279710","11280270"," want to Airbus."
"11280470","11284230"," That just isn't gonna happen because the airlines, they don't need another aircraft. "
"11285230","11290050"," If they have a $60 million machine sitting on the runway, because the engine doesn't work, what"
"11290050","11291210"," they need is a spare engine."
"11291730","11294390"," They need the engine that's on the wing repaired."
"11295410","11297210"," All of this will get done in time, Phil. "
"11297730","11302490"," And everybody in the industry, just as a step back be it, the owners of the aircraft like AirCap,"
"11302970","11308090"," the manufacturers like Airbus, the airlines and the engine guys and say, what's best for the long "
"11308090","11309510","-term health of our customers?"
"11310310","11316850"," And that's gonna require Airbus and Pratt to sit down and say, we need to come to an arrangement"
"11317410","11320770"," where we can manage the situation for our customers."
"11321410","11325450"," Because just telling the customer, you gotta buy another $60 million aircraft, another one, another"
"11325450","11325750"," one."
"11325990","11327610"," It's not gonna end well for the customers. "
"11328090","11330790"," So that's the biggest challenge over the course the next few years."
"11331390","11334270"," And Pratt will get there, but it's gonna take a long time."
"11334590","11337670"," It'll take a year just to repair one of these engines. "
"11338250","11344870"," So that means that the aircraft's on the ground for a very long time, unless they can get access to"
"11344870","11345990"," spare engines or parts."
"11346630","11347790"," And we're doing our best to help."
"11347970","11350050"," As I said, we're extending aircraft with airlines. "
"11350410","11353410"," We're selling aircraft to airlines just this year alone."
"11354330","11361110"," We will probably buy, sell or lease a thousand aircraft engines and helicopters and Boeing and"
"11361110","11361350"," Airbus."
"11361790","11364150"," But Airbus only produce 700 assets. "
"11364550","11369150"," So that gives you an idea of the level of insight we have to what's happening every day in the"
"11369150","11369870"," global industry."
"11370370","11370890"," Hey, Gus."
"11371530","11375210"," Gus, I hate to cut you off, but I'm being told we're getting pushed up against a break. "
"11375570","11377010"," We're gonna be watching this next year."
"11377050","11378430"," And I know we'll be talking more."
"11379010","11383990"," Gus Kelly, the CEO of AirCap, appreciate you joining us today and for some perspective on what's"
"11383990","11385150"," happening with commercial airplanes. "
"11385150","11386810"," Kelly, I'll send it back to you."
"11387030","11387890"," That was fascinating."
"11388270","11390090"," Gus and Phil, please come back any time. "
"11390390","11394690"," Super interesting to hear his candid take on what's going on with those engine problems and more."

"11558400","11559200"," Welcome back."

"11829930","11832110"," So you'd be ping ponging in here."
"11832730","11834550"," So you could trade just this as a bull."
"11836450","11840910"," If it breaks above, you'd then come back in on the bounce to take this to the upside. "
"11841410","11843810"," So it's very complicated trading this right now."
"11843990","11845810"," Make sure that you're a great fucking trader."
"11846090","11847470"," You understand the mechanics of how this works. "
"11851200","11852800"," And bulls are still holding it here."
"11852940","11854240"," There's no bearishness here yet."
"11854360","11855360"," You need to see the break below. "
"11855360","11857940"," Take that stab trade straight down here."
"11858700","11859220"," Okay."
"11859260","11862660"," If you're, if you're bullish and you're long already, you're like already trapped. "
"11863120","11868900"," Put some stops in or note that if it reverses on you, you'll be given a chance to get back"
"11868900","11870680"," out again right here before the drop."
"11871580","11875200"," Make sure you get using a managing your trades out there right now."
"11879670","11881130"," Very saucy right here. "
"11881370","11881690"," Very saucy."
"11882270","11883010"," Very tricky right here."
"11883170","11887550"," I love these trades, but make sure you understand the mechanics of it. "
"11893900","11895600"," Yeah, I saw the end short blow up."
"11896500","11898000"," I saw the end short blow up."
"12527830","12528430"," Welcome back. "
"12528630","12529030"," Here's the alphabet."
"12529430","12535190"," Now up 5% today having a delayed reaction to the launch of their Gemini AI model yesterday."
"12535850","12537850"," Let's get out to Deirdre Bosa for more on today's Tech Tech. "
"12538390","12539290"," Deirdre, come on."
"12539370","12541290"," In this thing in age 24 hour."
"12541790","12544350"," You know, we talked about this yesterday. "
"12544350","12545530"," You showed us the tape."
"12545910","12546110"," Yes."
"12546350","12547830"," And here we are 24 hours later. "
"12547970","12552450"," Everyone's like, wow, I know I could barely believe my eyes yesterday, especially after watching"
"12552450","12553490"," that sixth video."
"12553490","12554950"," I thought this is amazing."
"12554990","12557170"," Why isn't the market recognizing this?"
"12557250","12558530"," But it was just delayed. "
"12558690","12563890"," So the stock didn't do anything yesterday, but it was up today at 1.6% for a very, very"
"12563890","12564790"," large company."
"12565630","12566830"," So very strong reaction."
"12567050","12572450"," And maybe that tells us that the AI halo is still very much present, which we started to doubt"
"12572450","12578070"," yesterday and that Google has now won an edge in this AI arms race that we've been watching all"
"12578070","12578270"," year. "
"12578730","12584630"," Now, what Kelly said, you really have to see and hear Gemini's technology and the latest"
"12584630","12588510"," developments in generative AI to really understand the impact that it could have."
"12588670","12591370"," So I'm bringing you another example from that Google presentation."
"12591790","12592090"," Have a look. "
"12597160","12598440"," I know what you're doing."
"12598820","12600360"," You're playing rock, paper, scissors."
"12601500","12602640"," What do you see now?"
"12603340","12605760"," The fingers are spread out to look like the wings of a butterfly. "
"12606480","12607100"," What's this?"
"12607100","12609900"," Big ear and barking mouth, a dog."
"12612700","12614700"," If that didn't kind of amaze you."
"12614800","12615540"," Here's one more example. "
"12618920","12620920"," What movie are they acting out here?"
"12621540","12624500"," I think they are acting out the famous bullet time scene from the Matrix."
"12626580","12630480"," Now, I highly recommend the entire six minute video."
"12630680","12634580"," Other examples include Gemini understanding colors, 3D objects. "
"12634580","12637000"," It creates games and even cracks jokes."
"12637500","12641640"," Now, the word to describe this next evolution in AI is multimodal."
"12641940","12647500"," That means it incorporates audio, video, images, and you're going to hear that word a lot more. "
"12647640","12651860"," Kelly, so I'm keeping this short and simple and hoping that video speaks for itself."
"12652540","12656380"," Again, maybe part of the reason it was more subdued yesterday is that this is being rolled out in"
"12656380","12659120"," phases and it does kind of feel like it was rushed."
"12659380","12663980"," Google doesn't often have events between Thanksgiving and Christmas and the most powerful version"
"12663980","12666220"," won't be available widely until next year. "
"12666520","12667740"," So that could be part of it as well."
"12667940","12671180"," But clearly some pretty interesting demonstrations there."
"12671300","12673380"," Yeah, maybe if we wait a day, then the shares will be down. "
"12673700","12675500"," Yeah, that too."
"12675980","12677800"," Oh, wait, but not yet part of this."
"12678140","12679040"," Deirdre, for now, thanks. "
"12679300","12679980"," We appreciate it."
"12680160","12681320"," Our Deirdre Bosa out west."
"12681980","12682160"," Still ahead. "
"12682420","12683700"," Three more names on deck with earnings."
"12684020","12688500"," And my next guest says one of them is setting up for games post report based on one recent trend"
"12688500","12689360"," she has noticed."
"12689360","12693600"," We've got the trades for Broadcom, Lulu, and Ville resorts after this. "
"12853690","12859040"," Welcome back."
"12859340","12862920"," Semi's Sweats and Snow are the subjects of today's earnings exchange."
"12863500","12865000"," Marianne Montane is here with our trades. "
"12865240","12867060"," She's gradient investments portfolio manager."
"12867240","12868480"," Marianne, welcome back to you."
"12869040","12869940"," Let's start with Broadcom. "
"12870280","12875720"," I feel like it's an audience favorite coming off all time highs near the end of November when that"
"12875720","12877080"," acquisition of VMware closed."
"12877380","12882400"," Oppenheimer says the deal should add $15 billion to top line growth each year, along with AI and"
"12882400","12885680"," hardware partnerships with Apple and Google supporting their bullish call."
"12886040","12887080"," Do you like the stock here?"
"12887920","12888580"," I do. "
"12888760","12894400"," First of all, though, I have to say happy holidays to everybody and wishing everyone light and"
"12894400","12894620"," peace."
"12895500","12899360"," Now, as to Broadcom, this stack has performed very well."
"12899700","12902100"," It's up 45% over the last two years. "
"12902840","12909140"," What AMD had to say yesterday about AI and cloud computing is only positive for Broadcom."
"12909680","12917900"," We expect that those synergies coming out of the VMware acquisition will be very powerful and we"
"12917900","12921200"," expect management to talk about them today to put some numbers around that."
"12921560","12926920"," So we still think there's mid teens upside in this name with a 2% dividend deal. "
"12927140","12927740"," All right."
"12927980","12929400"," Let's move on to Lulu lemon then."
"12929400","12932280"," Off that 52, just off that 52 week high. "
"12932440","12938000"," Ray J watching the higher end consumer, saying growth in China, men's and promotional activity"
"12938000","12941780"," should all combat some of the softness in the luxury space or the aspirational space."
"12942220","12943300"," Would you stick with this one?"
"12943960","12944700"," I would."
"12944960","12947640"," You know, they had about 12% same store sales growth. "
"12948060","12952640"," Last quarter compare that to minus five plus percent out of target."
"12953260","12959040"," And we think that it's strongly driven by China where sales were up 60% last quarter six."
"12959260","12962720"," Oh, we think that there's been some. "
"12963160","12970060"," I short selling in the month of November and we think the stock will pop on today's report."
"12970340","12970900"," All right."
"12970900","12972780"," Going ahead with the bold call on earnings. "
"12972780","12973380"," I love it."
"12973460","12973680"," Okay."
"12973840","12976440"," Veil resorts is our last one down for the year. "
"12976660","12981480"," Stiffle pointing to their epic past program and some new acquisitions is a potential catalyst."
"12981540","12982800"," It's a supply constraint business."
"12982800","12983540"," There's no new mountains. "
"12983540","12987180"," But they also think skiers are recession resilient."
"12987180","12987960"," You agree?"
"12988760","12992020"," Well, I'm not so sure about recession resilient."
"12992300","12993640"," That's like being a little bit pregnant. "
"12994420","12999200"," Talk about the sales of preseason sales."
"12999540","13001100"," That is a passes annual passes."
"13001460","13002680"," Those were very strong. "
"13002940","13004460"," They were up about 11% in dollars."
"13004840","13010840"," And also you see a 15 to 20% increase in seats from airlines going to their properties."
"13010840","13016820"," So I think combine that with unfavorable weather conditions last year and you've got a few"
"13016820","13018180"," tailwinds going on here. "
"13018480","13021860"," Also a more normalized labor market and other efficiencies."
"13022040","13029040"," And there's a front range passenger rail that just got approval from the federal government that"
"13029040","13031380"," should help bring people over the longer term."
"13031740","13033420"," We haven't been buyers of this. "
"13033560","13036180"," It's been pretty bad performer in recent months."
"13036660","13040400"," But we're interested in watching for the results today."
"13040400","13044440"," With a 3.85% dividend yield, I think it's worth watching. "
"13044860","13047060"," In a bullish mood today, Marianne will let you go."
"13047280","13049420"," Thank you so much for your time, Marianne Montane."
"13049660","13051000"," That does it for the exchange everybody. "
"13051100","13052080"," Power lunches next."
"13052540","13054280"," Tyler and I will join you on the other side of the screen."
"13176290","13177390"," Paul, listen, find out. "
"13184020","13185400"," Welcome and good afternoon, everybody."
"13185900","13188140"," Everybody welcome to Power Launch alongside Kelly Evans."
"13188500","13189400"," I'm Tyler Matheson. "
"13189400","13189820"," I'm coming up."
"13190120","13192180"," We're getting ready for the jobs report tomorrow."
"13192220","13196420"," Some signs this week at the jobs market may be starting to cool just a bit. "
"13196820","13200040"," So what to expect tomorrow and what it could mean, Kelly, for the markets."
"13200540","13203580"," Plus some big CEOs on CNBC in the past 24 hours."
"13203860","13208720"," We'll hear highlights from AMD's Lisa Sue, Amazon's Andy Jassy, and Exxon's Darren Woods. "
"13209160","13212200"," And we'll get our traders take on those stocks coming up in three stock lunge."
"13212520","13215800"," First, let's get a check on the markets, though, where you can see the Dow close to session highs"
"13215800","13217920"," up 88 points today and it's a laggard."
"13218100","13224580"," The S&P up eight tenths to 45 86 and the Nasdaq surging 1.3% kind of calm bond"
"13224580","13230100"," yields are helping the 10 year around 4 11 last check and shares of Walgreens boots are leading the"
"13230100","13230260"," Dow. "
"13230560","13233740"," Up 7% on track for their best day since March of 2020."
"13234000","13236920"," The stock is still down nearly 40% this year, though."
"13237120","13238320"," It's worst year ever. "
"13238580","13241640"," And that's given the stock a very attractive 8% dividend yield."
"13242080","13242900"," You can see it higher."
"13243140","13245080"," In fact, even then the stock moves today. "
"13245080","13247840"," And the big drug companies are mostly lower today."
"13248060","13253560"," The White House, once again, targeting drug outfits, saying big pharma makes record profits while"
"13253560","13255680"," Americans struggle to afford the drugs they need."
"13256300","13261240"," Let's bring it to the minimums to explain exactly what the Biden administration is proposing. "
"13261720","13265560"," Yeah, in some ways it's like doubling down on the inflation reduction act, the price negotiation"
"13265560","13266420"," part of that."
"13266740","13271800"," The Biden administration is asserting the right of the government to seize drug patents of high"
"13271800","13275120"," priced drugs that were developed with taxpayer funding."
"13275600","13281100"," Now, the 1980 Biden Act paved the way for universities and small companies to commercialize"
"13281100","13286300"," discoveries made with federal funding from selling therapies and medical technology to things like"
"13286300","13288260"," Google and some quantum computing. "
"13288920","13295180"," Now, the White House aims to use the March in provision of that law to take on high drug prices."
"13295620","13301120"," Cancer patients have repeatedly petitioned the government to use that March in provision on a"
"13301120","13302040"," stylist's extending."
"13302040","13306520"," That's a prostate cancer treatment with a list price of more than $150,000. "
"13307060","13309380"," The government has repeatedly refused."
"13309880","13313140"," They say they should allow others to produce it to bring more competition."
"13313800","13319760"," While the bipartisan law allows March in when a patent is allowed to lay dormant, it's never been"
"13319760","13322940"," used to break a drug patent on the basis of price. "
"13323500","13328080"," Senator Elizabeth Warren applauds the move, saying it's time to use that tool to bring down costs."
"13329420","13336020"," When there's no competition in a market, then that falls hard on people who need that drug."
"13336360","13341480"," It also falls hard on taxpayers who end up paying for it through other government programs. "
"13342540","13345160"," And March in has been in the law for a long time."
"13345940","13352300"," The pharmaceutical industry group, well, basically they argue that March in was never intended to"
"13352300","13354060"," be a government price setting policy."
"13354060","13358980"," And to do so, we'll set back research by more than 40 years. "
"13359000","13362500"," So how would this March in work in a practical case?"
"13362760","13369420"," In other words, there is a drug that was developed in part with federal money is now being sold at"
"13369420","13374120"," a very high, some would say unattainable price for consumers."
"13375060","13378100"," The government would march in and say what?"
"13378400","13385280"," Unless you lower the price to X, we are going to take the patent rights of that drug and collect"
"13385280","13386140"," the profits from it."
"13386440","13386880"," How does it work?"
"13386900","13388540"," Ostensibly, that's how they would work. "
"13388700","13391300"," They didn't give an exact example of that."
"13391600","13397540"," But I was joking with you earlier that this is going to be the full lawsuit employment act."
"13397780","13401840"," There's certainly going to be litigation on this because you have patent law that works. "
"13402380","13405460"," Have they decided to do it or have they decided to think about doing it?"
"13405480","13406600"," They have proposed this."
"13406800","13411280"," They're going to take comments on this and then issue the final rule later."
"13411280","13418480"," At the moment, it's really about just communicating that they are looking at every way possible to"
"13418480","13419800"," reduce drug prices. "
"13420260","13421500"," Very, very interesting."
"13421800","13428100"," In the pre-political year, obviously a very lowering drug prices is a very potent political issue."
"13428260","13429100"," Bertha Coombs, thank you. "
"13430080","13435600"," All right, let's turn now to the potential companies that could become targets of this new plan and"
"13435600","13440740"," discuss whether the government can really enforce those March in rights joining us now."
"13440840","13447000"," Jared Holtz, health care equity strategist at Mizuho and Evan Ciderman, biotech analyst at BMO or"
"13447000","13448160"," BMO capital markets."
"13448160","13449480"," Welcome to both of you. "
"13449920","13451600"," Jared, let me start with you."
"13452640","13456920"," I think I just described sort of the process that could be at work here."
"13457180","13462680"," And on the one hand, you would say, well, how could the government get away with doing that, coming"
"13462680","13466780"," in and asserting that we're going to take over this patent, or if that's what they're saying"
"13466780","13468460"," they're going to do, unless you lower the price. "
"13468460","13474100"," On the other hand, there is a sympathetic side to this that says, well, how?"
"13474720","13481760"," If I, the taxpayer, have paid to develop this medicine, paid a lot of money, if my tax money is"
"13481760","13489820"," gone to that, and now the pharmaceutical company is charging $140,000 for a treatment of a prostate"
"13489820","13495200"," cancer drug, that doesn't feel right to me, and they get to keep all the profits, I'm getting"
"13495200","13496440"," stiffed at both ends."
"13498040","13499500"," Tyler, thanks for having me."
"13499840","13500480"," I appreciate it. "
"13501000","13506140"," I think this is a little bit of a slippery slope, obviously, for large-cap pharma and biotech."
"13506840","13513140"," These marching rights, though, you know, on the positive end of the spectrum are not really limited"
"13513140","13514260"," to this one sector."
"13514480","13516000"," I think it's much broader. "
"13516880","13520020"," It's going to go into the technology industry and many others."
"13520440","13522520"," Technology, defense, whatever, yeah, sure."
"13522520","13530320"," So it's much broader in scale than just this one industry group, which I think is good because"
"13530320","13536240"," we're always talking about how pharma seems to be the target of the government every other week. "
"13537080","13545340"," As I look across the space with respect to large-cap pharmaceuticals and biotech, not really sure"
"13545340","13553260"," that there are that many drugs that have been co-founded or co-developed with material government"
"13553260","13553640"," funding."
"13554380","13560920"," And if that's right, maybe the list of drugs that the government is going to go after in this case"
"13560920","13565220"," in order to secure the patents back is not going to be so vast."
"13565540","13566560"," And that's true. "
"13567140","13573000"," You know, maybe this is not a huge issue, but to birth this point earlier, it obviously adds on to"
"13573000","13577520"," the IRA and from a political standpoint, it's clear where the government's at here."
"13577800","13583920"," Evan, let me ask you, is this essentially an industry, and Jared just said it seems pretty"
"13583920","13584740"," political to him."
"13585080","13590120"," Is this essentially political theater that's going on here number one and number two, it would"
"13590120","13597280"," occur to me that one of the targets here, or a possible one, would be Pfizer and Moderna, whose"
"13597280","13601680"," COVID vaccines were heavily financed by the taxpayer?"
"13603220","13604700"," Well, there's a few questions there. "
"13604820","13608580"," First of all, is the political theater we are headed into an election year, so I'm sure there's"
"13608580","13610260"," some more posturing around drug pricing."
"13610260","13613540"," Biden got the win against the pharma sector with the IRA."
"13614460","13616460"," And this is kind of continuing that theme. "
"13617080","13621700"," In terms of Pfizer and Moderna, I think Pfizer, I don't know if they actually took much funding up"
"13621700","13621900"," front."
"13622000","13623660"," It was just some pre funded contracts."
"13624820","13631200"," But really, you know, the NIH does have a role in helping see these technologies, but these"
"13631200","13635040"," pharmaceutical companies put up billions of dollars at risk to actually develop the drugs. "
"13635040","13636700"," You don't want the NIH developing drugs."
"13636780","13637880"," They'll never get anything done."
"13638480","13642460"," Evan, who is most at risk in terms of potential research and development?"
"13642700","13646980"," Maybe there's some companies that come to mind, maybe biotechs probably speaking, maybe, you know,"
"13647060","13649120"," kind of talk, how would you be thinking through this as an investor?"
"13650080","13656060"," Well, if this were to actually happen, I think the entire sector could be at risk because who knows"
"13656060","13659640"," at what level the NIH or kind of the March and Rights would apply?"
"13659880","13663120"," Would it be some early technology like the basis of mRNA for the vaccines?"
"13663780","13665820"," Would it be part of an antibody drug conjugate?"
"13666220","13669300"," So it could be widely applicable probably in the specialty therapeutic space. "
"13669480","13675400"," So I think cancer drug manufacturers, inflammation drug manufacturers, so maybe have the"
"13675400","13677880"," potentially Merck Bristol."
"13678820","13681160"," And so what should those companies then do?"
"13681820","13686120"," Other, you know, what is anyone going to do other than kind of wait for more details and would we"
"13686120","13688380"," expect the Supreme Court to get involved at some point or no?"
"13688380","13693280"," I mean, that's, I don't know if the Supreme Court gets involved, but I'm sure if this went through,"
"13693380","13694260"," there would be several lawsuits."
"13694940","13696720"," I think the companies need to keep doing what they're doing. "
"13697040","13698220"," This is only a proposal."
"13698480","13703440"," This isn't actually necessarily going to happen, but it really takes into account whether or not,"
"13703440","13708380"," you know, these companies want to use the NIH and kind of funding and research from the NIH to"
"13708380","13710820"," help, you know, bring forward some of their R&D efforts."
"13711100","13715680"," They may kind of choose not to use that, do their own stuff internally and take them out"
"13715680","13719220"," completely, which would be a shame because there's a lot of good research coming out of the NIH. "
"13719880","13725280"," Jared, are there companies that you follow that you think would be more vulnerable to this?"
"13725520","13726280"," Should it happen?"
"13727600","13729920"," Well, you mentioned Pfizer and Moderna earlier."
"13729920","13735640"," I think those are two that come to mind right away given the vaccine funding over the past several"
"13735640","13736580"," years for COVID."
"13737120","13743520"," Really have to go and look and do the work on the discrete line items, company by company to see,"
"13743520","13749120"," you know, where the NIH has been funding, but I really don't expect it to be overly material. "
"13749940","13754960"," You know, my view at this point is it's more of a storyline, another negative narrative to add to"
"13754960","13761060"," the IRA in front of an election year, which is already possibly confounding and complicating a"
"13761060","13766000"," sector that has been, you know, not the best to say the least over the past year or so."
"13766300","13767240"," Yeah, indeed."
"13767480","13771640"," And Jared, just to put a point on it then, does this make it an impact on the economy or"
"13771640","13772340"," is it still going to be a different strategy?"
"13774220","13775200"," Yeah, I'm not sure. "
"13775200","13775800"," We've got to take a look at a federal government and It's just like the federal government, right?"
"13775800","13781340"," It seems like pharma is as out of favor as it's been as a category, obviously other than a couple"
"13781340","13786040"," that have been involved in the obesity space that we've spoken about at length all year."
"13786680","13792380"," You know, the multiples are very low at multi-year lows, the stock prices are at multi-year lows."
"13792800","13799320"," So I'm really not sure what takes the category higher other than, and a value trade which goes"
"13799320","13802860"," across industry groups. "
"13804140","13809940"," Hopefully at some point that this narrative quiets down, but given the fact that the Democrats seem"
"13809940","13816580"," hell bent on introducing new complexities into the sector, and then you've got the GOP, on the"
"13816580","13823220"," other hand, that has been fairly active in terms of how they've been politicizing the companies, it"
"13823220","13825800"," seems like the setup is not easy going into much here."
"13826540","13832100"," Does the CVS, you know, do the moves that they are making may be responding to cost plus drugs and"
"13832100","13832600"," all the rest of it?"
"13832780","13837080"," In the prescription drug space, is that another headwind for this sector?"
"13837320","13838380"," Is that a tailwind of it finally?"
"13838960","13841220"," How should we be thinking through that as well real quickly?"
"13842060","13843080"," I think we want visibility."
"13843540","13849800"," I think the street wants to have some sort of clarity on how companies are making money, what the P "
"13849800","13851660","&L's are looking like and how they're derived. "
"13852340","13856400"," And to me, that's a net positive, even if it means you might see a little bit of degradation in"
"13856400","13861560"," terms of earnings, the stocks are already trading so low, I feel like better visibility in this"
"13861560","13862760"," case might be a positive."
"13863000","13863920"," I think that makes a lot of sense."
"13864120","13864780"," Gentlemen, thank you both. "
"13864980","13865840"," We appreciate it today."
"13866200","13867920"," Jared Holtz and Evan Seeker-Men."
"13868340","13870380"," And still to come, jobs report on debt tomorrow. "
"13870900","13872280"," Major Fed decision next week."
"13872800","13875600"," Investors hoping the data could put an end to any future hike."
"13876040","13881000"," We'll get insight from the CEO of ZipperKruder, plus some major CEOs sounding off on our network"
"13881000","13881360"," lately. "
"13881900","13884620"," Amazon's Jazzy, ExxonMobil's, this is the studio."
"13884780","13885500"," This is the studio."
"13885840","14040180"," We'll give you the highlights and three stock lines coming up in "
"14040180","14040840","-store and online. "
"14042080","14046260"," Welcome back to Power Launch, everybody, as we count down to the November jobs report."
"14046460","14047480"," I know you're all doing this at home."
"14047660","14052880"," It comes out tomorrow, tomorrow morning, in fact, at 8.30, data this week show a cooler labor"
"14052880","14053520"," market. "
"14053920","14058740"," These are the sort of contextual numbers that we look at, private payrolls, up by 103,000."
"14058860","14063660"," But that missed estimates for November, which were about 30,000 higher than that, if I'm a colon"
"14063660","14063920"," correctly."
"14063920","14067420"," Initial job claims out today, little change, 220,000. "
"14067760","14071160"," Continuing claims did hit the highest level in two years."
"14072000","14077640"," Despite these numbers, our next guest says we could be in for an upside surprise tomorrow."
"14078120","14082500"," Ian Siegel is the CEO of ZipperKruder, a leading online employment marketplace. "
"14083080","14084600"," Mr. Siegel, welcome, good to have you with us."
"14084760","14090740"," Why do you say an upside surprise tomorrow when some of the other numbers do send, tend to indicate"
"14090740","14094160"," a slightly, slightly cooler job market?"
"14095400","14101760"," Well, to be very clear, if you look just at ZipperKruder job posting data, what you will see is"
"14101760","14107460"," that it continues to decline, just like it has persistently declined for the last 18 months, we're"
"14107460","14111740"," all the way back to where we were pre-COVID and we're continuing to fall from there."
"14112100","14117600"," However, to the end of the year is a really unpredictable time to predict what the BLS will say"
"14117600","14122520"," when it comes out with its jobs reported, because there is so much seasonal hiring at this time of"
"14122520","14130060"," year and often a single job posting can, in fact, be used to hire 100 or hundreds of individuals to"
"14130060","14131560"," fill a role for the next few months. "
"14132060","14140540"," The seasonal hiring is, I guess, reasonably strong in retail, but maybe even stronger in service "
"14140540","14144920","-oriented businesses, restaurants, hotels, et cetera."
"14145740","14150640"," Yeah, I think the real upside surprise that everyone is experiencing right now is that consumers"
"14150640","14155320"," continue to spend, and they're particularly interested in spending on experiences."
"14155400","14161640"," So whether you're talking about restaurants or event venues or any sort of tourist opportunity,"
"14162000","14167560"," those are areas where a lot of money is still going into the economy, and as a result, businesses"
"14167560","14168660"," are forced to staff. "
"14169400","14175320"," Do you see this as a time where the Federal Reserve needs to be mindful?"
"14175760","14181440"," They've had their focus has been sort of laser focus on keeping inflation down."
"14181820","14187660"," Is now the time that they need to start glancing in the mirrors and seeing where the employment"
"14187660","14188380"," market is?"
"14189840","14191580"," I mean, I'm gonna say, I sure hope so."
"14191860","14199040"," If you look at where we are relative to a year ago, you've seen wages begin to flatten in news"
"14199040","14200140"," that were for your job postings. "
"14200400","14205740"," You see the number of new job postings that have a signing bonus as part of what they're offering,"
"14205920","14213140"," down 25% from a year ago, in zipper-critical surveys of our employers, they're telling us that over"
"14213140","14218440"," half of them have lowered the salary of at least one position that they're currently advertising"
"14218440","14219080"," for."
"14219580","14225740"," So it definitely seems like the work that that has done has served its purpose."
"14226300","14230900"," I think we'd all like to see interest rates stabilize and ultimately decline. "
"14231520","14237940"," I think we know where the strongest sort of sectors are, like health care, education, tourism,"
"14238640","14240440"," hotels, restaurants, and so on and so forth."
"14240440","14240580"," Thank you, Canada."
"14240800","14241920"," But I want to ask a different question. "
"14241980","14242940"," Is that a question?"
"14242940","14243060"," It's pretty clear."
"14243700","14244600"," If we're not on the system."
"14244780","14246120"," I'm advertising for a job. "
"14247100","14253360"," And I do not include, in the description of that job, the option to spend some of the time"
"14253360","14258140"," remotely, how much of a disadvantage competitively am I putting myself?"
"14259420","14261620"," I mean, a massive disadvantage."
"14262420","14266860"," The world has fundamentally changed, and it's been long enough that I'm going to say, this is"
"14266860","14267960"," forever now."
"14267960","14273820"," So clearly, it's a hot topic to discuss whether or not we should compel people to go back to work. "
"14274340","14277260"," But the currently employed people are voting with their feet."
"14277660","14283320"," And what you see is higher satisfaction amongst those who are working for companies that allow some"
"14283320","14285100"," sort of hybrid work style."
"14285440","14292240"," You see that job postings that say they can be done remote get three times as many applicants as"
"14292240","14295200"," those that insist on an in office work policy. "
"14295880","14299720"," This is a sea change in what we have experienced over time."
"14299820","14303940"," And if you even compare the number of job postings on Zipper computer today with a year ago, you'll"
"14303940","14310220"," see that there's four times as many job openings that offer either hybrid or fully remote work in"
"14310220","14310800"," the job description."
"14311360","14314240"," So this is working its way through our economy. "
"14314240","14316320"," Any advantage will be taken by employers."
"14316500","14317820"," Remote is key here."
"14317980","14320660"," So Brian, Karim, Nicky, you all can go home. "
"14320780","14321460"," You can work remotely."
"14322280","14323760"," Okay, get on out of here."
"14323820","14324340"," That sounds good. "
"14324980","14326380"," Ian Siegel, thank you very much."
"14326380","14327280"," We appreciate your time."
"14328240","14329300"," Thanks for having me. "
"14329680","14331000"," I just saw Steve Arb's going."
"14331340","14333140"," Yeah, they're out of here."
"14333240","14334380"," They're all good, but you gotta stay. "
"14334780","14336660"," Mr. Jim, I mean, not Mr. Jim."
"14336800","14338680"," Mr. Steadicam, Mr. Steadicam."
"14339400","14342980"," We're going into the capitulation phase here. "
"14343720","14349160"," So if you don't notice or don't know, there is a bunch of capitulation happening right now."
"14349760","14351160"," Be careful as this happens."
"14351160","14352380"," It'll be very quick and fast. "
"14353760","14355400"," Let's take a look on the upside here."
"14355460","14357380"," We're going to clear out a bunch of this supply up here."
"14359560","14362920"," I can't, for some reason, this is stuck for me today, but hold on. "
"14365020","14367520"," Got three nice bread bars up there."
"14368240","14370280"," They're going to slam right into this capitulation."
"14370760","14372740"," Just know that there is supply up there. "
"14373020","14377300"," We're going to switch over really quick to a trigger screen here."
"14378460","14380940"," And be sober about this, okay?"
"14383600","14389480"," Or you should be sober about this as we come up into this yellow bar right here."
"14390980","14394160"," Let me get a closer look at it, make sure that I got this right. "
"14394360","14395320"," I don't want to fuck this up."
"14396740","14399320"," Get right down the dirty over here."
"14399320","14400880"," Right about there. "
"14405040","14408180"," And watch this capitulation as it takes place."
"14408700","14415320"," I want you to remember that these are where known sellers are up here, okay?"
"14416540","14423500"," So as we come up in here, as you see this capitulation, we can get really violent, right?"
"14423900","14429140"," You just slam through and they will try to sell back down on you."
"14429140","14433240"," So there's someone that's short up in here they're going to tell you there's not, but there is a"
"14433240","14435320"," short up here and they're going to be pissed off, okay?"
"14436100","14441160"," And then you got another group of sellers up in here and they think they're fine right there just"
"14441160","14442900"," like, yeah, fuck you, I sold up here. "
"14443220","14445960"," You'll have people say, all they closed already down here, that's not true."
"14446640","14448700"," These are known sellers up in here."
"14448880","14453520"," So even if they close, they're standing here, ready to fucking rain rocks down on top of you. "
"14454580","14459060"," So as we come into this capitulation, we're going to squeeze up in here, right?"
"14459640","14464040"," And then they're going to try to knock you back down here and here, just note that they are here."
"14464600","14466240"," Also remember something else."
"14466580","14471300"," I see some people on FinTwit claiming that we're going to 4800 like today. "
"14471460","14477900"," I want you to know that as we come up here, the expectation for this week, clear as fucking day,"
"14477940","14480540"," I've been saying this shit for three, four weeks."
"14481360","14482900"," Like 90, it's been three weeks now."
"14483320","14485100"," Expect that sideways movement. "
"14485660","14489760"," I want to make another comment about this, which is I went on to YouTube last night."
"14491200","14495160"," And I want you to see this action right here, okay?"
"14495620","14497080"," I want to show you guys something here."
"14498900","14503400"," I went on YouTube last night, right?"
"14504540","14510820"," And people were posting thumbnails on their videos showing this down move, right?"
"14511660","14514100"," And they were making it seem like this was collapse. "
"14514760","14517120"," In reality, we are a range bound."
"14517640","14518860"," I want you to be aware of that."
"14519060","14522280"," We are range bound, whether you like it or not. "
"14522500","14524380"," So as we blast up here, right?"
"14525660","14531420"," As we blast up here, start squeezing up here, it's nothing for us to roll back down, right?"
"14531640","14536360"," And maybe even possibly take out this one up here and then roll back down and bloodbath into"
"14536360","14538560"," Wednesday of next week."
"14538800","14542600"," So be sober in your trading."
"14543180","14547280"," I want you to realize that as we come up in here that we are still range bound. "
"14547820","14554500"," Those people that were posting collapsed videos with thumbnails, they made it seem like they were"
"14554500","14558120"," only showing like this side of the trade or this side of the chart or something."
"14558680","14562280"," And it looked like doom and gloom on their thumbnails."
"14563480","14565160"," In reality, we are range bound. "
"14565780","14571820"," We are tied to 4600 and we have a floor down here that we know about, right?"
"14573420","14579060"," So just be aware that as we have these actions here, you're gonna see people saying 4800, right?"
"14579240","14581700"," Fucking now, it's not showing that."
"14581840","14583320"," So just be aware of it."
"14583380","14585500"," Look at like scale out a little bit here. "
"14586140","14588500"," No big deal for us to roll back down, right?"
"14589200","14590400"," Catch another bump down in here."
"14590540","14592160"," You get your Friday clothes up here."
"14592700","14593740"," You get what I'm saying to. "
"14594460","14599140"," And then you have your drop off into Tuesday or Wednesday."
"14599510","14605500"," Now, if you were a short or someone that is interested in throwing on a put spread for next week,"
"14605960","14607260"," we're in the place for it."
"14607420","14609240"," You might lose a few ticks up here. "
"14609580","14615940"," It might hold into Monday, but this is not a bad little area to start to hedge a position, okay?"
"14616540","14618280"," So listen to me closely right now."
"14619080","14621920"," Just like yesterday in that close, right?"
"14622140","14627880"," And I'm trying to be sober and have a better picture of where we actually are."
"14628360","14632400"," I'm not trying to sell you subscriptions on YouTube, right?"
"14632860","14637700"," Where I show all that doom, I want you to realize that have a little bit of a better picture"
"14637700","14638100"," here, right?"
"14638340","14641260"," Squeeze this up, come back down, come down here. "
"14641460","14644220"," Squeeze this up here, come back down over here, right?"
"14644440","14645900"," Get another one up in here into the clothes."
"14646200","14648080"," There's a whole bunch of stuff that can happen in here."
"14648400","14653240"," But as we come up here, you can be long call spreads, whatever you wanna be, but not call spread,"
"14653400","14653920"," zero dates, whatever. "
"14653920","14662000"," But just be aware that there's a seller hiding up in here, hiding here, and he's hiding here so"
"14662000","14665700"," that he can position himself into next week, okay?"
"14665940","14667300"," So start thinking about that."
"14667520","14672340"," If you're, if you're trying to put a hedge on, this is a nice place to put one on for"
"14672340","14673480"," as a cupboard."
"14673880","14676920"," Nice place to put a hedge on into next week. "
"14677580","14679240"," Starting to enter that zone, okay?"
"14679600","14684040"," Even if we're strong here, starting into that zone, you get into capitulation, we just traded up to"
"14684040","14687700"," a 4.56, 90, you just poked the bear."
"14687960","14688660"," That's what you did."
"14689080","14693720"," You see that reversal candle on a one minute chart, probably out of a sense show to you right now. "
"14694480","14696720"," So see this candle right here, this reversal candle."
"14698280","14699960"," See that right there, you know what that is?"
"14700140","14704720"," That's a bear up there trying to poke on you right now and send you back down to the depths"
"14704720","14705120"," of hell."
"14705300","14706260"," So just be aware of it. "
"14706360","14711420"," Note that people are going to position a hedge on the market into next week."
"14711420","14716040"," It sucks to buy a hedge when it's like, you know, like I'm going to wait, I'm going to wait,"
"14716060","14720600"," I'm going to wait and then it blasts down 30 points and you don't have a buffer any longer on"
"14720600","14721060"," your hedge."
"14721320","14725240"," So just be hyper aware of it and let's see if I can open that back up. "
"14727720","14732460"," Let's be aware that this is a known place that sellers are going to step in and they're going to"
"14732460","14734400"," hedge some positioning here."
"14734700","14736620"," Puts are cheap dude, they're dirt fucking cheap."
"14737320","14741440"," Get yourself some Wednesday fucking puts that are OTM right now for like one, two, three, four,"
"14741560","14745520"," five betties, just stack a hundred of them and don't just forget about them. "
"14745920","14748700"," Put on in the money, put spread."
"14749120","14750840"," Think about it where we are right now, right?"
"14751340","14754580"," Throw a put spread that's just in the money that expires on Wednesday."
"14755500","14759860"," You'll capture all of that fucking, you'll capture all that data burn. "
"14760200","14765440"," You'll likely have a down moment on Wednesday for the break decision where you can actually have"
"14765440","14766600"," the opportunity to close."
"14766600","14769800"," So a nice fat put spread in the money, right?"
"14770020","14774460"," You get that put spread, you throw it on there, you get a put spread, I don't know what you"
"14774460","14777140"," get it out here but I'd get like 460 to 458."
"14778040","14784160"," I bet you you can make an easy, easy 20% minimum on that trade and you're just looking for"
"14784160","14787080"," a moment of volatility on Wednesday to close them down, right?"
"14787600","14792140"," It's like a softball, if you don't understand, it's like a softball trade. "
"14792420","14798880"," So right where we are or if we continue to blast up and roll over, you should have that moment"
"14798880","14802860"," where you can add one right here or even add one up here."
"14802960","14806620"," So it seems likely they're taking it in the day to the same way we are."
"14806840","14811460"," So if you catch that roll, even if we squeeze later, we just catch that roll on a Wednesday and"
"14811460","14815500"," shazam, cha-ching, you made a bunch of cash down here, right?"
"14815700","14821220"," Ring the fucking register, no brainer trade, fucking softball, that's what it is, the fucking"
"14821220","14821860"," softball. "
"14827000","14829440"," Just zone out a little bit here, right?"
"14829740","14833260"," Like, hold on, just remember that we are range bound, okay?"
"14833500","14834400"," Don't get too crazy."
"14835420","14838100"," And I wouldn't get too crazy as a bear here."
"14838640","14843480"," You're not, don't be like out there fucking buying, like, don't be out there fucking buying, like"
"14843480","14848780"," don't be out there slamming the whole account short to market here and you're gonna diamond-hand it"
"14848780","14851420"," down to fucking 435 or something like that. "
"14852440","14856060"," You're just trying to capture some of that volatility into Wednesday."
"14861680","14864320"," Hey, Trader Podcast, we gotta talk about that too, man."
"14865240","14868280"," I'm gonna give you, like, a special area for that too, man. "
"14868700","14873380"," Now, we gotta make sure we highlight that for people, for those pivots."
"14873640","14874280"," Just be conscious."
"14875060","14879520"," I just saw somebody, Trader Podcast talked about, I think he's been talking about it since this"
"14879520","14885380"," morning, I think, early this morning, but the yen dollar short, right?"
"14885380","14893380"," I just saw someone, I just reposted his shit on Twitter and someone smartly said, oh, I'm gonna buy"
"14893380","14894960"," the fucking dip on that right now. "
"14895720","14899340"," That person, who I don't know who that Trader was, but let me see who it was."
"14899600","14901520"," This Trader was, I reposted it."
"14904120","14905380"," Who, what's his name here?"
"14907980","14912780"," Poppin' Into Farin, H-O-P-I-N-D-A-F-O-R-E-I-N-G. "
"14913260","14914960"," That guy just was like, yeah, fuck it."
"14915380","14919680"," You know, like, when you see stuff like that, big giant moves outside, moves like that, that's an"
"14919680","14921480"," opportunity for you to go and swoop in."
"14922240","14925920"," And right now is one of these opportunities on spy and tech. "
"14926440","14930500"," As we approach up here, you can just be like, yeah, I'm just gonna throw something in the money on."
"14930840","14934220"," All we have to do is break back down below, and we have a volatility event coming."
"14934740","14938380"," On Wednesday, we have some volatility coming to the market, one way or another, so. "
"14938720","14940220"," I bet it's a cheap trade."
"14940400","14946100"," I'm not gonna look it up right now, but right around here, these are the two places that you start"
"14946100","14946960"," to consider."
"14948560","14955360"," This one right here, and this bar right above it to put a nice little hedge on. "
"14955580","14957300"," Don't worry too much if we squeeze up."
"14957940","14959200"," You know, don't care about that."
"14959660","14965320"," Just put the trade on, right, and close that laptop with that trade and come back to it on"
"14965320","14965600"," Wednesday. "
"14966360","14968700"," Open it up, and I guarantee it's gonna be printin' for ya."
"14969440","14971160"," It's an easy, easy trade."
"14972120","14978200"," You're basically sayin' to yourself, if we hit 4,600, I know it's gonna bounce down, right?"
"14978320","14979140"," That's what you're tellin' yourself. "
"14979500","14982820"," If we hit 4,600, expect that bounce down off of that 4,600."
"14983520","14985640"," Easy trade, easy fuckin' trade."
"14985800","14987320"," If it gets rejected, you're already in. "
"14987560","14989800"," If it squeezes up, you already know it's comin' back."
"14990520","14991680"," So fuckin' simple trade."
"14995820","15003560"," Alright, I gotta go. "
"15007160","15013260"," Now I'm next to these old January futures, settle at $2.54.92 per gallon."
"15019450","15025750"," And gasoline futures, settle at $2.0012 per gallon."
"15032380","15040380"," You just crude off futures, settle at $69.34 per barrel, down 4 cents or 0.06, or 0.006"
"15040380","15041160"," per cent. "
"15042360","15047280"," Excuse me, that's all that said, down 0.06 per cent."
"15811840","15813740"," Watch that roll comin' down right now."
"15905220","15911600"," I'm gonna be tryin' to get some puts here, so if you're gonna be grabin' some puts, if I buy"
"15911600","15913620"," any, I'm gonna let you guys know, okay?"
"15913940","15914720"," Let me just one second here. "
"15943540","15946280"," I'm just waitin' on the confirmation rejection candle."
"16006720","16010220"," No confirmation yet, just watching for rejection candle here."
"16010260","16012320"," If we get the rejection candle, I'm gonna buy some puts. "
"16069420","16071620"," Alright guys, just the heads up here, right?"
"16075800","16080000"," I should not be doing this, so do not follow me on this, okay?"
"16080380","16081580"," Do not follow me on this."
"16084660","16089860"," I'm about to load the fuck up on puts here, and only because they're pennies."
"16091040","16096260"," You're probably gonna lose all your money in this trade, so don't take it, we're likely going up. "
"16097400","16100840"," But I am gonna load up here on 457Ps."
"16101920","16104960"," There's six and seven cents right now, I don't care."
"16105740","16111500"," I don't give a fuck that, I don't care if they burn, but you shouldn't follow me on this trade. "
"16113000","16116660"," It's just, it'd probably print like 5,000%."
"16117420","16119640"," So that's the only reason I'm gonna grab my pair."
"16120520","16124100"," I'm gonna grab them on this red bar on the map up there. "
"16124400","16128040"," I'm gonna try to grab them right up on that red bar for rejection if we can get it."
"16137540","16141460"," Do you want to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for"
"16141460","16142620"," non-farm payrolls?"

"16159890","16163310"," We'll cast a $8.5 billion prior at $9.06 billion."
"16178620","16180100"," I got them for today, man."
"16184200","16186440"," I don't think we're gonna roll down there, they're too cheap. "
"16186680","16190500"," I think they were going up, but it's just so cheap that I gotta do it."
"16209510","16212750"," You shouldn't be asking me how long I'm gonna hold these things for."
"16212750","16214750"," Zero dates are directional. "
"16215750","16218190"," If you don't know that, you probably shouldn't be trading them."
"16218870","16222750"," They're literally, they have zero intrinsic value, zero."
"16223730","16226090"," They're good for one thing and one thing only. "
"16226750","16227910"," A single direction."
"16228230","16231170"," The moment that direction ends, they go back to zero in value."
"16231750","16233910"," If you don't understand that, you should get in our discord. "
"16234990","16237090"," I don't recommend anyone trading."
"16237990","16240990"," Zero dates, if you don't understand their funds at all."
"16240990","16242390"," But the environment is very dangerous. "
"16242390","16243150"," It's a little different."
"16243430","16245050"," The mechanics of that."
"16245210","16246770"," Julie Borston is here to explain. "
"16247190","16249250"," Well, Kelly, right now it's a rough market for startups."
"16249650","16253790"," The third quarter saw the lowest overall venture deal value in six years and the lowest number,"
"16253830","16259450"," number of deals in three years with U.S. BC funding this year on pace to set a nine year"
"16259450","16265010"," low plus companies that are managing to raise funds increasingly are doing so at lower valuations."
"16265530","16271870"," The number of down rounds in the third quarter climb to a 10 year high with 26.4% of"
"16271870","16275730"," rounds completed year to date done at a flat or reduced valuation. "
"16276450","16279870"," Now, lack of access to capital means more companies are going out of business."
"16280270","16285490"," Carta reported that 87 of the startups on his platform that had raised at least $10 million had"
"16285490","16287270"," shut down this year as of October."
"16287890","16292430"," That's twice the number of companies that shut down in that same category for all of last year. "
"16292930","16298410"," And now, after only 27 companies went public in the third quarter, there is a pile up of companies"
"16298410","16304610"," waiting to go public 75 according to pitch book, including some big names such as Stripe and Chime."
"16305010","16309410"," And as we look ahead to our next list, it's worth pointing out that our first 11 lists have"
"16309410","16311430"," identified some outperformers."
"16311430","16318850"," Our disruptor 50 index companies that have gone public from our disruptor 50 list is up 28% year to"
"16318850","16321690"," date versus the S&P 500's 19% gains. "
"16322110","16327170"," So now we are looking for private company nominations for the 12th annual disruptor 50 list, which"
"16327170","16328130"," will debut in the spring."
"16328510","16334510"," To learn more, scan that QR code on your screen or go to cnbc.com slash disruptors."
"16334650","16340950"," What is the classic description of a disruptor for this contest or competition?"
"16341610","16345870"," Well, what I have to say is when I founded this list 12 years ago, the idea was to look"
"16345870","16348610"," at how technology is disrupting every single industry. "
"16348770","16353610"," So what we see every year is companies not just in sort of stereotypical tech industries."
"16353830","16354910"," Yes, we have a lot of AI."
"16355350","16357730"," Open AI was the number one company on the list last year. "
"16357950","16363550"," We also see companies in the ag tech space in logistics, even in retail."
"16363790","16368490"," So there are all sorts of different ways people are using technology to disrupt their respective"
"16368490","16369050"," industries."
"16369430","16370590"," The companies do have to be private. "
"16370830","16375550"," They're usually venture backed in the ideas to find the fastest growing and most disruptive"
"16375550","16376530"," companies."
"16376850","16379190"," So really ones that are prompting change in their industry."
"16379190","16383390"," And you said the number of deals, the number of deals that are down, the number of companies that"
"16383390","16384169"," are going public or down. "
"16384410","16387730"," What do rising and the number of bankruptcies are up?"
"16388250","16391830"," What do rising interest rates have to do with all that?"
"16391830","16392849"," They have a lot to do with that."
"16392930","16397570"," I was actually talking with my colleague Bertha Coombs about the biotech space because two areas"
"16397570","16403509"," which have remained relatively resilient relative to some other categories are AI based companies,"
"16403890","16407390"," no surprise, but also biotech in the life sciences field."
"16407390","16412830"," And she was saying that rising interest rates have hurt that category because those are so cost"
"16412830","16417029"," intensive, those types of companies are so cost intensive, you're not just launching an app. "
"16417430","16420070"," And we have seen that negative impact throughout the space."
"16420230","16424470"," But also remember we have that Silicon Valley bank implosion this year."
"16424669","16426130"," So that has had an impact as well. "
"16426410","16428730"," And overall concerns about the economy."
"16428849","16432430"," So there have been so many different factors that have put pressure on this market."
"16432790","16437330"," But a lot of investors have said this is a great time to get in because evaluations have come down. "
"16437890","16439230"," Julia, great to have you in the house."
"16439410","16439950"," Great to be here."
"16440050","16441110"," Excited to see you. "
"16441150","16444330"," So many headlines said to get to a solo time left."
"16444970","16447130"," We will power through as many as we can in closing time."
"16447410","16448390"," Power lunch is back into. "
"16448669","16452630"," Five minutes from the top of the hour where we gave you as consumer credit, forecast eight spot,"
"16452689","16454950"," five billion, five nine spot, zero six billion."
"16456430","16460110"," Come on, make him burr, make him burr, baby, make him burr."
"16526140","16530080"," It's a reminder early on he did have news at AMD stocks rose. "
"16530619","16533380"," After it's a chip rollout challenges and video."
"16550430","16551890"," Some money that news did come."
"16552009","16552470"," I guess today. "
"16565310","16567169"," I'm still on those puts right now."
"16609700","16610599"," Welcome back everybody."
"16610900","16615200"," Two and a half minutes in the show and several good stories to talk about today, starting with"
"16615200","16617300"," Moody's reportedly advising staff at its. "
"16617400","16619220"," Just give me a 20 minute fucking rug."

"16701980","16708520"," And I gather that some of the people who had these behind the back conversations felt as though"
"16708520","16712619"," Altman was not accurately representing what they had said."
"16712860","16712939"," Right."

"16847600","16850500"," You're pretty right as to where you thought we would be."
"16851300","16853960"," You 4750 was your target for the end of this year."
"16854200","16854680"," We're at 46. "
"16854960","16855720"," We'll call it."
"16855780","16858200"," You said mega cap was going to lead the way."
"16858420","16859320"," In fact, it has. "
"16859640","16865940"," Why do you think things have gone right for you and investors and bulls for the most part?"
"16866020","16866540"," Especially lately."
"16867460","16872060"," I think people were fooled by the yield curve at the start of this year thinking we'd have a hard"
"16872060","16872520"," landing."
"16873200","16874740"," And they didn't want to fight a Fed. "
"16875020","16877300"," But they're forgetting the Fed was fighting an inflation war."
"16877300","16878660"," Not a business cycle."
"16879280","16881380"," So our bet was inflation would be softer. "
"16882060","16883080"," You'd avoid a hard landing."
"16883440","16888020"," And then we've seen the Fed kind of take its foot off the neck of monetary policy."
"16888380","16891380"," So I think it was economists were too bearish. "
"16891500","16894340"," And the technical picture turned positive very quickly."
"16894540","16895440"," It was a triumph of technicians."
"16896040","16897020"," Yeah, it's not over yet. "
"16897400","16897840"," Right."
"16898120","16905020"," And there are those who still say that the cycles going to end because of what the Fed has already"
"16905020","16905400"," done."
"16905600","16906660"," We just haven't seen it yet. "
"16906660","16907680"," You've heard that."
"16907820","16908560"," How do you respond to that?"
"16909100","16912500"," I think people should study market internal structure."
"16912900","16915820"," We've seen a huge turnaround in cyclical stocks. "
"16916420","16917380"," The banks are turning."
"16917760","16919260"," The regional banks are turning up."
"16919560","16920340"," Small caps are leading. "
"16921160","16922980"," This is not end of cycle market behavior."
"16923300","16926620"," This is early cycle expansion re-accelerating."
"16926780","16928440"," What if it's just a late year?"
"16929280","16930320"," Run as fast as you can. "
"16930640","16931660"," Catch up to what you missed."
"16931880","16935720"," A lot of money has come in and it's just chasing everything to the end of the year as rates"
"16935720","16936360"," have come down."
"16936360","16938740"," Well, if we thought this was a head fake. "
"16939620","16944260"," I think if this was 98, we could run another 7% from today to when?"
"16945120","16945540"," To your end."
"16947060","16948560"," I think 4800 is more reasonable."
"16949080","16954200"," But I think that if it was a head fake, we'd see credit calling baloney. "
"16954480","16956600"," We'd see spreads riding or high yield falling."
"16956980","16958280"," But what's happened is spreads have rallied."
"16958580","16959060"," High yields rallied. "
"16960200","16965980"," It's actually an improving liquidity rally while investors took $240 billion out of stocks this"
"16965980","16966160"," year."
"16966160","16970960"," So you're a believer in the broadening of the move and you think it carries beyond the calendar"
"16970960","16971320"," turn?"
"16971600","16976540"," Yeah, because now as we get into next year, we'll have an FOM to see decision."
"16976960","16981100"," But I think it's going to show the Fed is no longer fighting an inflation war, but really shifting"
"16981100","16982700"," towards managing the business cycle. "
"16983380","16983860"," Huge change."
"16985280","16988060"," I think interest rates could make a huge move lower."
"16988400","16994000"," Mark Newton, our technician thinks it could be 3.5%, 3.2%. And that would take mortgage rates down"
"16994000","16996340"," to 5% or under 5%. "
"16996340","16997840"," We know that would help the economy."
"16998140","17000380"," And I think there's a lot of pent up demand for CapEx."
"17000700","17003860"," So I'd say that stocks could do very well next year. "
"17003960","17004600"," Well, you must."
"17004780","17009640"," If you think we're going to get to your target for 2024 S&P is 5200."
"17010600","17010840"," Yes. "
"17011100","17011660"," What gets us there?"
"17012340","17013440"," Well, it's earnings recovery."
"17013780","17016420"," So we think earnings hit 265 by 2025."
"17017000","17019080"," That's two years of like 9% growth. "
"17019080","17024380"," And you put a 20 P.E. A 20 P.E. has happened 50% of the time when the"
"17024380","17025940"," 10 years between 4% and 5%."
"17025940","17028700"," So it's the most common P.E. to apply."
"17029500","17030460"," And that would be 5200. "
"17030860","17037140"," But I think that's conservative because 265 is 5% of it's coming from cash, right?"
"17037680","17039400"," So there's like 3% organic growth."
"17039580","17043640"," I mean, cash earnings is 5% growth right now per year."
"17044260","17050080"," I hear bears say earnings aren't going to be as good because inflation is not going to be as good"
"17050080","17050780"," for earnings. "
"17051420","17052500"," And that's going to be a negative."
"17052840","17054420"," And that's why the market's overvalued."
"17054500","17059460"," And people like you at 260, $260 are just way too optimistic on where earnings are going to be. "
"17060140","17062020"," Well, I think people should study the PPI."
"17063060","17065740"," Like four or five sectors are correlated to PPI."
"17065920","17069940"," Materials energy, meaning as inflation falls, they make less money. "
"17069940","17072860"," But tech and industrials have almost no correlation to inflation."
"17073880","17075740"," And then financials are positively correlated."
"17075960","17080520"," So I think you have more groups that could actually have better earnings power into next year. "
"17080740","17083560"," And especially if caution comes off companies."
"17083760","17085840"," You know, CapEx, there's a lot of pent up to mean CapEx."
"17086040","17090280"," Five out of 10 groups actually sort of cut CapEx as a percentage of revenues last year. "
"17090420","17092520"," So you have a CapEx opportunity."
"17092960","17094740"," You have a home recovery opportunity."
"17095440","17096500"," And you have interest rates falling. "
"17096840","17098980"," It's hard to say stocks should fall next year."
"17098980","17102140"," So the market thinks the Fed's going to cut first in March."
"17102700","17103940"," Three meetings from now. "
"17104720","17105420"," Is that what you think?"
"17106860","17109720"," I mean, to me that intuitively seems aggressive."
"17110240","17113200"," But what's going to matter more is what the bond market starts to price."
"17113460","17118160"," And I think the two years telling us the Fed does have to cut meaningfully next year. "
"17118260","17124660"," Because if they don't cut and inflation weakens, the level of real Fed funds is associated with"
"17124660","17125340"," hard landing."
"17125340","17128360"," Like the Fed if they're trying to manage the business cycle would be cutting rates."
"17129080","17132340"," Yeah, but you think it could be a little aggressive in terms of March. "
"17132560","17137740"," Do you need the Fed to be somewhat aggressive in cutting to get to your 5200?"
"17139400","17142000"," We just need the market to get comfortable with two things."
"17142300","17143820"," The curve can stay inverted."
"17144220","17147660"," Meaning the tenure could actually go to 2.5 and the Fed still at 4."
"17148500","17152320"," And the second is that stocks and bonds don't have to be positively correlated. "
"17152560","17154640"," So yields could go up and stocks could rise."
"17154640","17159120"," So I think that there's some protection or buffer against if the Fed doesn't cut rates."
"17159120","17163480"," How much do you need a cash to come in from money markets that's been sitting in safety?"
"17164300","17168920"," And now it goes towards risk assets because rates have come down and you get better yield out of"
"17168920","17169580"," the equity market. "
"17170060","17174640"," Yeah, I mean, Scott, this year if someone bought Fang, they'd be up to 85%."
"17175280","17177800"," That's 15 years of money market cash."
"17178080","17181220"," If they buy small caps next year and small caps are 50, that's 10 years. "
"17181220","17185240"," So I do think that 240 billion dollars that left is coming back in."
"17185860","17188900"," But hedge funds also have very light positioning and equities."
"17189020","17192680"," I mean, I don't know if you saw that there's almost a 5-year low in hedge fund positioning and"
"17192680","17193360"," financials. "
"17193420","17196400"," And financials really should be where things turn next year."
"17196760","17198660"," You think financials are going to be one of the leaderships?"
"17198720","17199500"," What about small caps?"
"17199780","17205260"," Because that's where a lot of the conversation has been of this awakening that the Russell has had."
"17205560","17205800"," Yes. "
"17206320","17207800"," There's still a lot of non-believers."
"17208360","17208840"," Yes."
"17209240","17210840"," I think there's the callus in place. "
"17210980","17212240"," We've had 12 years of underperformance."
"17213020","17218040"," The price to book of small caps to the large caps is exactly where it was in 99, which was"
"17218040","17219820"," the start of a 12-year bull run."
"17221060","17223140"," Banks are huge weight in small caps. "
"17223440","17225260"," We know falling rates helps asset quality."
"17225700","17226700"," So regional banks should rally."
"17226980","17228180"," That should pull up small caps. "
"17228860","17231520"," It's clearly under owned and they benefit from inflows."
"17232080","17235920"," And then, of course, I think large cap banks are really good plays on a cap cycle."
"17235920","17240540"," So to me, it's easy to see that 20, 30% kind of moves in those groups. "
"17241200","17245440"," I mean, small caps may be 50, whereas it's harder to say fang can do 50 next year."
"17245600","17250040"," The other big call that you're making today, despite revealing your target at 5,200, is suggesting"
"17250040","17254500"," that mega caps, tech, not going to lead next year."
"17254780","17255160"," That's right. "
"17255460","17255480"," Why?"
"17257020","17262140"," It's that I think the earnings growth they produce doesn't look as special if the PMIs are turning"
"17262140","17262280"," out."
"17262280","17265920"," If the ISM turns up, S&P earnings going to grow, you know, 15, 20%."
"17266540","17272120"," And then, on terms of multiple expansion, I think people are going to be willing to fade a fang"
"17272120","17276000"," multiple expansion, whereas they'll buy a financials multiple expansion. "
"17276320","17276980"," So I want to be clear."
"17277680","17284320"," So you think there's going to be a rotation out of mega cap into some of these, quote unquote,"
"17284660","17285220"," unloved areas?"
"17285640","17285880"," Yes."
"17286420","17291400"," I mean, you know, fang is still a number three pick, which means we get outperforms. "
"17291400","17297140"," But if someone's saying where will they get the best risk reward, I think it's clearly financials"
"17297140","17297780"," or industrials."
"17297880","17302980"," When you say that fang's still outperforms, the word you use, put some context to that."
"17303060","17303480"," What does that mean?"
"17303660","17306100"," Well, let's say S&P is up 12 to 15. "
"17306700","17313560"," Next year, fang will be maybe a little bit better, whereas financials probably can be up 30, and"
"17313560","17316380"," industrials can be up 25, and small caps can be up 50."
"17316380","17321600"," So we're going to really have that significant of a mean reversion trade, so to speak."
"17321820","17322020"," Yeah. "
"17322320","17323100"," I think it's consistent."
"17323400","17326980"," If you look at like the history of stock like Amazon, they have great, you know, a step up year,"
"17327460","17328200"," and then they consolidate."
"17328860","17329200"," Wow. "
"17329500","17330360"," Let's expand the conversation."
"17330760","17336360"," Bring in CNBC contributor Joe Terranova of Virtus and Ayako Yoshiyoka of wealth enhancement group."
"17336380","17338140"," It's great to have everybody with us. "
"17338320","17339460"," I go to you first."
"17339820","17342380"," Does Tom Lee make a lot of sense or not?"
"17343960","17344520"," Hi."
"17345780","17346880"," Yes, absolutely. "
"17347280","17351980"," You know, 2023 has really been defined by a very narrow market."
"17352240","17358420"," And so it makes a lot of sense that going into 2024 that we would see a broadening out of"
"17358420","17364840"," the market, and especially if the economic data comes in, you know, relatively benign, you know,"
"17365060","17366800"," neither too hot or Nicole to hold."
"17366800","17369940"," So you do think we're going to have a broadening. "
"17370160","17375840"," You agree with Tom that we're going to have these lagging sectors are going to be the leaders that"
"17375840","17377200"," tech can still do well."
"17377500","17380480"," It just doesn't have to carry all of the weight like it did this year."
"17382160","17382640"," Absolutely. "
"17383120","17388560"," I mean, I think if the economy continues to stay relatively strong, I mean, some of the, you know,"
"17389360","17396100"," names in the lower half of the S&P 500 have a lot of room to have the multiple expansion."
"17396100","17402340"," As well as perhaps some upside surprises to their earnings growth as people start to anticipate a"
"17402340","17405800"," recovery from the slowdown in 2025."
"17406300","17408560"," Joe is Tom too optimistic or not. "
"17409180","17412680"," Well, first of all, Tom's been incredibly accurate so far in 2023."
"17412680","17414920"," So congratulations for that."
"17415180","17416840"," I run an equally weighted strategy. "
"17416840","17422360"," So I'm excited to hear your comments for 2024 because that obviously means the strategy is going to"
"17422360","17422620"," be favored."
"17422620","17425120"," But there's three points I think we need to hit on."
"17425280","17430780"," First of all, when you look at the market right now and you talk to advisors who have clients"
"17430780","17431740"," sitting in cash. "
"17432260","17437120"," The first thing that they will tell you is they expect the economy to slow and the cash that Scott"
"17437120","17438820"," sites going into risk assets."
"17439360","17440860"," Those risk assets are inequities."
"17441360","17445880"," They want to put those assets into credit because they believe they're also going to get price"
"17445880","17446440"," appreciation. "
"17447120","17448100"," How would you respond to that?"
"17449200","17450980"," You know, I'm a fan of bonds."
"17451240","17455260"," You know, high yield returns 80% of stocks with less volatility."
"17456300","17461400"," But we know that if bonds rally next year, that actually has an expansionary effect on PEE. "
"17461620","17466780"," So to the extent people decide to allocate to bonds and spreads have a huge rally, it actually"
"17466780","17468240"," means there's upside to the S&P."
"17468660","17470560"," Just because the multiple now is more ribbed expand."
"17470560","17475400"," So Joe, what, so Tom says 20 times earnings make sense. "
"17476500","17479680"," Earnings at 260 make sense."
"17480880","17482160"," Is that too aggressive or not?"
"17482600","17484200"," He's too aggressive with financials."
"17484400","17485500"," I'm worried about financials. "
"17485700","17486340"," Let me explain why."
"17486660","17487360"," What about the overall?"
"17488320","17489520"," Give me the view."
"17489680","17491460"," He says 5,200 on the S&P. "
"17491640","17491980"," Follow me."
"17492080","17492600"," Stay with me."
"17492920","17494160"," I'm staying with you, Scott. "
"17494420","17495360"," You know me a long time."
"17495520","17496920"," I don't do S&P price targets."
"17497300","17497840"," I do the environment. "
"17497840","17501000"," I've never sat here and said we're going to 5,200."
"17501540","17503420"," The environment is delivering for a one."
"17503600","17506160"," We can agree to have a conversation about this. "
"17506440","17511800"," Is the environment going to be optimistic enough that the S&P can get to 5,200?"
"17512500","17513360"," I don't know the answer to that."
"17513560","17515220"," I don't think anyone knows the answer, but I'm sorry, Tom."
"17515760","17517900"," Do we have double digit returns next year?"
"17518220","17518440"," Yes. "
"17518840","17519120"," Absolutely."
"17519400","17519560"," You can."
"17520220","17520980"," What about you?"
"17521160","17521400"," What do you think?"
"17521400","17527540"," I think we could have double digit returns too, but I think the set up is very different going into"
"17527540","17529760"," 2024 than what we had in 2022. "
"17531040","17537180"," We had a lot of upside surprises this year in 2023, and I think we could have some jolts depending"
"17537180","17543000"," upon how the data really pans out and how earnings really pan out in 2024."
"17543000","17551180"," I mean for earnings to get to $260, things have to go really right, don't they?"
"17551640","17558240"," I mean how perfect, I hate to use that word, but in some sense things need to be perfect that"
"17558240","17565620"," inflation needs to come down to target, the Fed definitively needs to be done if not cutting, the"
"17565620","17571700"," business cycle needs to keep humming, the labor market needs to remain robust so that consumers"
"17571700","17579860"," don't stop spending, can all of those things mesh and make this a perfect in quotes scenario."
"17581120","17589820"," I mean never say never, but at the same time it does create difficulties for you know 2024. "
"17590500","17598780"," I think you're going to get bouts of it and it's not going to be a good thing."
"17598780","17602800"," I think the first half could be a little bit more murky as everybody anticipates these rate cuts"
"17602800","17610240"," and if we don't get them and the economic data, it really does slow and perhaps more so than"
"17610240","17615520"," everybody anticipates, then that bad news can really create some havoc in market."
"17616380","17621800"," Tom, how would you assess how I've described what needs to happen for you to be right?"
"17622160","17626900"," Am I overstating it or do things really need to be perfect?"
"17626900","17628280"," You need to get to 5200. "
"17629280","17632940"," If you're inputs like me, there should be a reversal back to the downside."
"17633700","17639600"," I don't care if my puts get torched here, but I'm still holding it, but just be careful here."
"17639720","17644060"," So if you're going to get squeezed out of your puts, look for a red reverse panel that will be"
"17644060","17645760"," able to pick you out of trade. "
"17646160","17648760"," It's basically GDP of 3% real."
"17649500","17651040"," I think that's pretty doable."
"17651160","17658360"," So unless we have a total of 2.8. Wow. "
"17658600","17659120"," For 2025."
"17659540","17660040"," In earnings."
"17660480","17662780"," In earnings because remember, buybacks is another 5."
"17662860","17664920"," I mean, just buybacks and cash is 10% a year. "
"17664920","17669340"," 275, 280 will make you like, I mean, you're so high up."
"17669340","17670620"," We can barely see you."
"17670740","17677100"," We need a telescope to see your number on earnings relative to where everybody else on the street"
"17677100","17677240"," is. "
"17677340","17679740"," I haven't heard anybody suggest that you could get high as 280."
"17680200","17682760"," I mean, just keep in mind this year, healthcare earnings are down 20%."
"17682760","17687980"," They won't be down 20% for two more years and basic materials energy are down like 40 and staples"
"17687980","17694840"," are down so we could as those turn those contribute to SOP earnings meaningfully especially energy"
"17694840","17699240"," right energy was such a huge swing factor it's been absent for this year why is it going to be"
"17699240","17704000"," better next year well if let's say price stabilizes so you just look up the curve there they won't"
"17704000","17710040"," be dragging earnings you'll actually have a positive contribution because they're not declining so"
"17710040","17716060"," it's it's not hard to get to 265 actually sounds strange but that's two years from now all right"
"17716060","17725800"," Aya financials energy do you like either in 2024 we like energy I think the setup for energy"
"17725800","17732320"," still remains very favorable you know valuations still aren't at you know extremes I think you know"
"17732320","17738640"," you've had some big announcements you know in the industry that are consolidating and you know you"
"17738640","17744120"," have earnings growth and if the economy really doesn't slow that much if we get at that mild"
"17744120","17750020"," recession or the you know soft landing scenario energy just continue to do well as we go into 2025"
"17750020","17756580"," and beyond Joe you wanted to take on Tom about his financials call why financials and energy first"
"17756580","17760760"," of all with energy what if the price doesn't go lower keeps right if what if the price doesn't go"
"17760760","17764920"," high the price goes lower you get a massive liquidation everyone is overweight energy Tom you know"
"17764920","17769520"," that ambition on financials where's the where's the earnings growth come from because if you think"
"17769520","17775020"," about it you lose the effect of interest income interest income was up 22% in 2022 is up 18 "
"17775020","17780760","% in 23 it's actually going to decline next year JP Morgan and City told us yesterday at the Goldman"
"17780760","17786480"," serve of SAC conference the trading revenues down you've got all CEOs complaining about regulation"
"17786480","17793060"," and Basel III what does that leave you with deal making yeah well a couple things one what you've"
"17793060","17797800"," described is why no one owns financials right because that's why hedge funds have the lowest long"
"17797800","17805140"," positions in five years second as George Boyd had a kid of research famously says it takes a whole"
"17805140","17810840"," lot of e to offset PE the financials trade next year is about price to book or price to earnings"
"17810840","17815740"," which means it doesn't mean it doesn't matter what earnings do next year it's how earnings power is"
"17815740","17820580"," transforming and look if we have lower interest rates we know that this saves commercial real"
"17820580","17826680"," estate it revives housing I don't think any investor says oh well your Q2 numbers aren't gonna be"
"17826680","17830640"," great they're gonna say this is a switch in how we look at earnings power for the next couple years"
"17830640","17835980"," so I think financials have huge multiple expansion potential and then trading as you know trading"
"17835980","17840540"," is spontaneous if it's weak this quarter it could be huge next year I mean 240 billion dollars take"
"17840540","17845100"," now gross exposure is low I'm not surprised there hasn't been much trading it's gonna pick up a lot"
"17845100","17850340"," next year but in that scenario you have to have a soft landing the way you're describing it I I"
"17850340","17854580"," hope we don't have a landing yes I don't think Tom's like suggesting anything other than that and"
"17854580","17864400"," if not no landing right I mean you're if you think we can 270 280 on earnings well we can't"
"17864400","17872220"," even come close to a soft landing that better be a no landing no late cycle re-acceleration of the"
"17872220","17876080"," economy for all the factors you suggested yes Scott and one thing I think people have lost"
"17876080","17880680"," perspective on is when the Fed went on those tightening campaign and brought rates in the US above"
"17880680","17887080"," any other developed world we already had a hard landing in Europe and China so the US avoided a"
"17887080","17891760"," hard landing because what broke was outside the US if you think those economies worsen next year"
"17891760","17896000"," then we're in trouble but if they're turning around and the DAX is telling you things are turning"
"17896000","17901680"," around Europe you don't need a landing in the US because we had a landing elsewhere I give you the"
"17901680","17910880"," last word no I think you know Tom always make some great points about the market outlook and"
"17910880","17917780"," betting against Tom has not been favorable I think to many investors so I would go and listen to"
"17917780","17923940"," what Tom has to say all right Daya thank you Tom of course thank you as well Joe we'll see"
"17923940","17927520"," in the market zone because we have a little broad time to talk about before those earnings let's"

"18249510","18255270"," months ago almost feels like at least and this morning we're getting reporting from the information"
"18255270","18260450"," and others that maybe there's not as much there there as we thought and Gemini is not as powerful"
"18260450","18267290"," as it was initially touted to be maybe it's the equivalent of what GPT three actually was and so"
"18267290","18273070"," I'll say let's hold on for a second let's let's wait to see after people get their hands on this"
"18273070","18278530"," Gemini model just how powerful it actually is but I will say I'm also thankful that Google has"
"18278530","18283850"," finally woken up and joined the party yeah look at I'm not gonna be critical of the fact that you"
"18283850","18289230"," don't own alphabet you can't own everything I think that's fair to say you own Amazon and Microsoft"
"18289230","18297310"," of course Apple and some other names as it relates to this space but do you feel like we're gonna"
"18297310","18303530"," get as we turn the calendar into 2024 we're gonna get a more distinguishing line between the real"
"18303530","18309450"," winners and those who are pretenders a hundred percent I think we're we're probably turning the"
"18309450","18314770"," corner here where we're probably gonna add another three I think maybe four names to the"
"18314770","18320050"," magnificent seven as we've been calling them this year that are all the names that are actually"
"18320050","18325210"," doing something tangible in the world of AI and I think the ones that are going to be the dominant"
"18325210","18331190"," leaders of that 10 are the ones that show a way to actually commercialize and generate revenue"
"18331190","18335990"," using those tools sooner than later so a lot of what we were promised in AI back in March was"
"18335990","18340690"," solely just the promise of this is this is what AI is gonna do I think we're we're now gonna"
"18340690","18345330"," be a little more critical and say show me the money as I reference you obviously have a significant"
"18345330","18352510"," exposure to megacaps which Tom Lee who's as bullish as anybody I've heard suggests that they're not"
"18352510","18357650"," going to lead they're going to outperform but the megacaps are not going to lead in 2024 do you"
"18357650","18363490"," share that view absolutely not I was shocked to hear Tom say the financials were actually going to"
"18363490","18370070"," be twice as good as from an investment return perspective as megacap tech I think realistically"
"18370070","18374690"," what is happening is the broader economy is not doing so great right now but it's being"
"18374690","18380370"," overshadowed by the fact that AI has just captivated our imagination and made us excited about the"
"18380370","18385950"," return potential as investors with these seven to ten stocks as I mentioned and so I think all of"
"18385950","18391390"," the capital one way or another is going to flow into those ten names in 2024 and that's what's"
"18391390","18395790"," going to end up dominating the S&P and the NASDAQ once again wow so it's gonna be the same"
"18395790","18400730"," thing that happened this year you you must not does that mean you're not as as sanguine on the"
"18400730","18407350"," economy as as others or earnings so we're gonna once again just go balance sheet hunting for safety"
"18407350","18412910"," well as I said I think that the broader economy is not doing so great right we just got a"
"18412910","18420610"," well it's not doing so bad not to it's so bad maybe but I think that what we're seeing is"
"18420610","18425930"," a dislocation between the stock market where we should have had a pretty flat stock market this"
"18425930","18431110"," year not nearly as impressive as it is except for the fact that AI came in in March thanks to"
"18431110","18436710"," chat GPT and stoked everyone's excitement about investing all over again and it's tech tech tech"
"18436710","18442210"," and so I think we'll add a few names maybe we add Adobe maybe we add Salesforce maybe we add"
"18442210","18449870"," AMD names like that that have actually shown a immediately commercial ability to generate revenue"
"18449870","18455010"," using these tools specifically co-pilots that they've adapted but I don't think that the broader"
"18455010","18460870"," stock market is necessarily in any better shape than it was the last couple of quarters I think"
"18460870","18466270"," we're just not seeing it because the S&P is getting led by AI once again no but the performance"
