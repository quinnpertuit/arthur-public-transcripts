"zqj-zpYXNSk","30000","47240"," Check 1, 2, see if that works. Turn that off. Turn that on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","47240","52240"," Let's see what's going on. Hey, what's going on?"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","61760","65240"," Trying to get on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","65240","69240"," You have something to talk about too. I'm glad I'm able to get on."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","106240","113240"," Everybody do it. Good to see y'all. How's everybody doing out there?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","113240","122240"," One quick second. I didn't get a chance to put a thumbnail up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","122240","126240"," Members. Save."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","126240","129240"," All right. Give me one quick second share."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","129240","133240"," Copy. Close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","133240","140240"," I've got some streamlabs failing to post my live stream all morning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","140240","144240"," We're going to see how this works. See if this does it or not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","144240","147240"," Send that right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","147240","152240"," Today is a trend day. Today is a trend day down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","152240","157240"," We're going to take a look at the Webull full screen here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","157240","164240"," We need to show you two things that are important here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","164240","170240"," On trend since last 15 minutes here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","170240","173240"," So stay on trend here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","173240","175240"," What's going on?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","175240","178240"," To stay on trend here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","178240","184240"," You're looking for bulls to buy this dip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","184240","186240"," Now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","186240","189240"," We are under the hourly trigger here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","189240","192240"," Right here is the early trigger HD."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","192240","196240"," And we always know that if price is below."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","196240","201240"," Trend not to trust it. It's more of a sell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","201240","204240"," Than a buy. So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","204240","207240"," I need to get this. I need to say I'm kissing a kicked off."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","207240","210240"," Streamlabs again. Just hold on one second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","211240","215240"," So I do want to express to you that we are below the hourly trigger here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","215240","218240"," And why does this matter?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","218240","222240"," The first reason this matters is a 15 minute chart here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","222240","224240"," You can see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","224240","227240"," A bear plane forming here in the 15 minute."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","227240","232240"," But even scarier for a bull here is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","232240","234240"," On a one hour."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","234240","236240"," Trend."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","237240","242240"," This is the place where bulls have been getting caught."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","242240","248240"," So let me explain the last time that bulls got caught here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","248240","251240"," Was right."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","251240","255240"," It was right in here. Just a quick failure."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","255240","258240"," Right failure to catch trend."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","258240","260240"," Come underneath the 20 70 a man."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","260240","265240"," The early and that was it right sell off from it sell off from it to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","265240","268240"," And I want you to just to bring your attention here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","268240","271240"," You can see how the hourly trend is right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","271240","274240"," And just continued lower. This is the one 29."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","274240","276240"," And right in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","276240","278240"," Same kind of a deal right."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","278240","281240"," Got the early trend right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","281240","287240"," And if you get the reversal into this closed down here and being under the hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","287240","292240"," There could be a pretty significant bull trap here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","292240","294240"," Into the rest of this week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","294240","296240"," Just be cautious here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","296240","298240"," Into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","298240","301240"," What has to happen for bulls here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","301240","307240"," Is that they need to regain this close if they don't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","307240","311240"," Regain this close right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","311240","317240"," There is a bull trap in here is a bull trap set up for tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","318240","322240"," Death doom destruction into Wednesday Thursday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","322240","325240"," Waiting for bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","325240","327240"," So are you aware of this out there?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","327240","330240"," I don't know if you're aware of this right now or not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","330240","334240"," You guys watching this right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","334240","338240"," Let me know in the comments if you're watching this right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","338240","340240"," You're paying attention to this stream."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","341240","349240"," I suck at this. That's Casey Kizzle."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","349240","354240"," Casey Kizzle just said I suck at this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","354240","359240"," Yeah, you're listening. Okay. So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","359240","362240"," Seven out of eight trades have gotten bad for you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","362240","363240"," We had it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","363240","365240"," We had a great trade on the open today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","366240","372240"," I ended up adding calls with somebody at the belly yesterday for 14 or 15 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","372240","375240"," To the to the position I already had. I took them."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","375240","378240"," You guys already know that I take the money and run on the ballot."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","378240","379240"," No matter what."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","379240","381240"," Anyways, you don't need me to tell you that anymore."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","381240","386240"," So I was a great trade on the open this morning. How are you seven out of eight trades?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","386240","388240"," No, look."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","388240","391240"," You guys are fucking hilarious."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","392240","397240"," Watching learning, hating life."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","397240","401240"," So I want to show you some pay attention here. Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","401240","405240"," So pay attention here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","405240","409240"," So today we're going to look at a couple of things here, but."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","409240","411240"," Just pay attention here. Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","411240","414240"," Bull's not getting lift off today. Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","414240","418240"," We're saying one more time. I'm going to go over this one more time with you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","419240","423240"," Now, traditionally, if you're looking at traditional charting,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","423240","427240"," you can see it right here. Okay. Here's 27 EMA. This is our trend."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","427240","434240"," We know that our trend will produce results for one to three days minimum."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","434240","437240"," Could be five days."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","437240","442240"," So just inside here, you don't want to see price the end of this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","442240","446240"," You'll end up having a bad time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","447240","450240"," We'll end up trading."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","450240","453240"," That weekly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","453240","456240"," Which is right down here. Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","456240","460240"," Into this close, you'll end up trading that weekly trigger here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","460240","462240"," You can see it right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","462240","466240"," Trend is beginning to break lower into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","466240","469240"," This is all they want right here on Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","469240","475240"," They get there for 26 bulls need to get above the hourly trigger like right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","475240","477240"," They don't have a chance. They have a choice."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","477240","483240"," They don't have a chance if they close below here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","483240","485240"," Now we are on trend."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","485240","487240"," If you're like a traditional chartist or whatever,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","487240","490240"," you're like, yeah, I'm looking to buy all these dips here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","490240","492240"," Yeah. Who I bought the dip. Yeah. Who I bought the dip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","492240","494240"," And now I'm ready to buy the dip again."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","494240","501240"," So you're looking for like some extreme push higher up into this close here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","501240","504240"," But not good enough if we close below this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","504240","511240"," This will be setting up a pretty significant down move into tomorrow's open."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","511240","514240"," Now we're also going to take a look."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","514240","519240"," Yeah, let me see if I can switch this over here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","519240","526240"," We're also going to take a look at the previous example of this happening here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","526240","528240"," So we're going to take a look at another chart right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","528240","535240"," Give me one quick second trigger screen."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","535240","537240"," So just inside of here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","537240","543240"," I also want to draw your attention to something else in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","543240","547240"," And this is last time it rolled over was right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","547240","557240"," And you can see that you have that little bit of an up day and then rolled it right under right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","557240","559240"," See it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","559240","565240"," Rolled it right under down here and we're seeing that same setup right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","565240","571240"," To then begin to roll it under one more time to the downside. So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","571240","578240"," At least from at least from my perspective here, it's risky."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","578240","584240"," I would say to you if you're a buyer."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","584240","589240"," I'm going to switch back over to this main screen."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","589240","594240"," I'm going to say to you that if you're a buyer for the rest of the week, if you're trying to buy a dip here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","594240","597240"," You have no dip by here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","597240","598240"," Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","598240","604240"," So if you're a buyer, not a seller, I'm going to show to you this way right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","604240","609240"," This hourly trigger, this break below hourly trigger today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","609240","615240"," Until you're able to get back above this hourly trigger, you have no trade too risky."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","615240","619240"," If you're a seller, you are in charge right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","619240","626240"," If you're a seller from this point into Thursday as long as price stays below here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","626240","631240"," Even if it squeezes back up and begins to sell down any of this action right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","631240","633240"," You are poised."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","634240","636240"," To trade."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","636240","642240"," The weekly trigger that target down below is right now 427 flat."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","642240","646240"," So if you're looking for that 427 into the rest of the week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","646240","649240"," We're trading four thirty seven sixty three right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","649240","654240"," You are looking you are targeting that four twenty seven into."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","654240","662240"," End of week right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","662240","667240"," Apparently I needed you to say sell the open. I'm part two stubborn."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","667240","670240"," Always take all you like."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","670240","675240"," So if you're the reason that you always take the open is because it's a zero date."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","675240","678240"," So it's directionally going to make you that money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","678240","681240"," The moment that that direction stops, you lose the money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","681240","683240"," So you should take the money on the opening bell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","683240","688240"," Well, maybe like five seconds after the opening bell so that at least registers."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","688240","693240"," And then you renegotiate that trade if it's going to continue higher with like cheaper,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","693240","695240"," cheaper calls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","699240","702240"," So let's see what you guys are saying."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","702240","706240"," You really want to wind like a mule right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","711240","714240"," Man, dude, you're killing me."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","715240","718240"," I sold."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","718240","724240"," I sold Wednesday calls yesterday and then one day calls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","724240","725240"," I sold."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","725240","730240"," Then I went back in and bought twenty cents one dates and then they."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","730240","733240"," They were bleeding into like the last fifteen minutes on stream here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","733240","736240"," Someone was like, Hey, man, those calls are bleeding."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","736240","737240"," So I was like, fuck that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","737240","738240"," I'm going to buy more."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","738240","740240"," So I bought fifteen cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","740240","743240"," It was like four ten or something like that yesterday afternoon."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","744240","747240"," So we're going to find out here what happens."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","747240","749240"," We're going to find out into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","749240","751240"," I'm kind of fascinated here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","751240","755240"," To see what the setup is for the close because."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","755240","758240"," The idea here would be."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","758240","761240"," Two fold right that you get."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","761240","763240"," Some kind of a."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","763240","764240"," Yeah."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","764240","765240"," Hables."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","765240","766240"," Everything's going to be fine."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","766240","769240"," And they kind of tease you with the hourly trigger here into the close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","769240","774240"," But yeah, it's just another another another another reason to sell this market off."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","774240","775240"," So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","775240","777240"," You really need to be above this age."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","777240","779240"," If you're if you're a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","779240","781240"," You got nothing here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","781240","783240"," You're you're a seller."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","783240","784240"," You're in heaven right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","784240","787240"," This is this is the setup right here for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","787240","792240"," Significant down more significant significant more downside to come."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","792240","796240"," So if you're if you're a bear out there, you should be."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","796240","800240"," This is everything that we want for the next few days."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","800240","804240"," Yeah, this is this is nothing right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","804240","806240"," Like this is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","806240","810240"," I guess if you're like, oh, this is probably we're probably done to going down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","810240","812240"," Nope, we got another hundred points."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","812240","814240"," We can go down from here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","815240","816240"," Bear music."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","816240","818240"," No, bear music until you get four."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","818240","822240"," You get no bear music for me unless you get four four twenty seven."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","822240","824240"," Then you get a bear music from me."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","824240","826240"," You don't get bear music for being right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","826240","828240"," This is where the dip is to be bought."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","828240","832240"," Like this is the place to buy the dip, not sell the rip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","832240","834240"," So if you're a bear, you're a bear."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","834240","835240"," You're a bear."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","835240","836240"," You're a bear."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","836240","838240"," You're probably done to going down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","838240","839240"," Mm."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","839240","840240"," Nope."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","840240","842240"," We got another hundred points we can go down from here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","842240","844240"," That's all the rip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","844240","852240"," It's so like, let's look at this again."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","852240","854240"," So if so, let's go over."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","854240","856240"," Let's go over a rule here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","856240","858240"," Let's go over a rule here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","858240","862240"," Hold on a second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","862240","864240"," Okay, so."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","864240","868240"," Here are the rules."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","868240","870240"," If you're going to buy a dip, where do you buy it?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","870240","872240"," Right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","872240","874240"," Hold on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","874240","876240"," Move this over."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","876240","878240"," Hold on a second."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","878240","880240"," So if you're going to buy a dip, where is it?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","880240","882240"," It's right here, right? Yeah, you buy that dip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","882240","886240"," I guarantee people are like, I ain't buying that shit."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","886240","890240"," And then people are like, I ain't buying that shit either."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","890240","892240"," Right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","892240","894240"," And then you're like, I ain't buying this here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","894240","898240"," Now, why would I recommend to not buy this versus buy that and buy this?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","898240","900240"," Do you know the reason?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","900240","904240"," It's because this little green arrow, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","904240","906240"," This little green box right here was lower."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","906240","910240"," It's like down here and we were over it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","910240","912240"," Right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","912240","916240"," And so you're kind of looking for that same thing first here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","916240","920240"," Where you begin to think about the dip by here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","920240","922240"," There's no dip by here unless."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","922240","926240"," There's no dip by here unless we get above that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","926240","928240"," There's a trap here for bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","928240","934240"," There's a trap here for bulls because you're going to want to buy this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","934240","938240"," If I was just looking at a traditional tribe like, hell yeah, I'm buying this right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","938240","940240"," And we're going to be good to go."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","940240","942240"," But I don't want to get trapped in here. I need to see it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","942240","944240"," Get above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","944240","946240"," We need to see the reversal."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","946240","950240"," In a confirmation trade that it's going up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","951240","954240"," Yeah, a hundred points."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","954240","956240"," A hundred points to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","956240","958240"," If you can get this close here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","958240","964240"," If you're a seller and you can get this close right here, you should get a hundred points to the to the downside here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","964240","968240"," So you're just looking to stand underneath that hourly trigger and you're going to get it hands down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","968240","970240"," Hands down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","970240","974240"," Same setup as this is the same setup as."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","974240","976240"," I'm just going to do the one hour here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","976240","978240"," Same setup as right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","978240","980240"," You should get a hundred points to the to the downside here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","980240","984240"," So you're just looking to stand underneath that hourly trigger and you're going to get it hands down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","984240","986240"," Hands down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","986240","990240"," Same setup as this is the same setup as."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","990240","994240"," I'm just going to do the one hour here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","994240","996240"," Same setup as right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","996240","998240"," Show this team."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","998240","1000240"," Move that over."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1000240","1002240"," Same setup as right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1002240","1006240"," Just right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1006240","1008240"," Nice awesome day."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1008240","1010240"," Slam it up into the close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1010240","1016240"," We actually got the continuation this time to a great open."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1016240","1018240"," Sold some calls right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1018240","1020240"," Immediately starts to sell down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1021240","1024240"," And as soon as you're underneath that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1024240","1028240"," As soon as you're underneath that that that twenty seven E.M. and hourly."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1028240","1029240"," It's just sell off."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1029240","1030240"," It's sell off."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1030240","1031240"," It's sell off."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1031240","1032240"," It's so right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1032240","1036240"," You have the initial price selling."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1036240","1040240"," So you're going to be expecting a rejection here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1040240","1044240"," On this hourly as we kind of this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1044240","1046240"," So even right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1046240","1050240"," See this hourly triggers right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1050240","1054240"," You're going to expect any kind of."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1054240","1058240"," Any kind of trade higher to be met with."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1058240","1060240"," Selling to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1060240","1064240"," So even right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1064240","1074240"," Four thirty eight sixty one."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1075240","1079240"," Even right now this this line right here is becoming resistant."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1079240","1083240"," So even though this is saying hourly triggers up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1083240","1086240"," This yellow line is actually becoming resistance right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1086240","1091240"," So we'll we'll wait and watch it as we get in this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1091240","1099240"," We'll wait and see if there's any kind of any kind of."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1099240","1100240"," This is actually higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1100240","1105240"," It's right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1105240","1108240"," I'm going to take that one right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1108240","1109240"," We got that one right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1109240","1112240"," We got this one right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1112240","1117240"," It's a little bit higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1117240","1119240"," So let me know in the chat what you think."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1119240","1123240"," I'm not going to I'm not I suck at doing polls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1123240","1128240"," We know in the chat if you see this yourself or not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1128240","1133240"," Do you see this bull trap in the making here or are you like no cap we're going to."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1133240","1136240"," We're going to squeeze this up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1136240","1143240"," And get above that hourly trigger and do a nice reversal for the bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1143240","1149240"," We take a look around right now and we take a look at something else here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1149240","1155240"," See if there is actually if there's a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1155240","1158240"," This is a bear trap and not a bull trap."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1158240","1163240"," Yeah, we're still coming down on PPO."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1163240","1172240"," Starting to make the turn on PMOs still not quite there yet."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1172240","1174240"," Yeah, it's that total last leg down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1174240","1192240"," Hold on one second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1192240","1197240"," Four thirty nine."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1197240","1200240"," Yeah, they're setting up the cell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1200240","1203240"," So there's."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1203240","1208240"," There's four hundred and seventy two thousand."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1208240","1213240"," Four forty."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1213240","1217240"," Four forty C's."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1217240","1225240"," And when you see when I right now when I see those."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1225240","1231240"," Telling me that they're there to pin the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1231240","1235240"," To not allow the market to close four forty."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1235240","1242240"," There's a half million."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1242240","1247240"," Half million four forty C's right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1247240","1250240"," Sometimes they close in the money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1250240","1255240"," Might not need that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1255240","1261240"," Sometimes they'll close these in the money, but these are most certain they're worthless right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1261240","1265240"," They're eight cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1266240","1269240"," But you just just see it just leaning at this right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1269240","1272240"," It's highly unlikely they'll allow these to close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1272240","1279240"," In the money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1279240","1283240"," But they're the four thirty nine's look juicy. So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1283240","1286240"," The four thirty nine's definitely look juicy into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1286240","1289240"," So we'll see if that was thinking about buying some right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1289240","1291240"," Some four thirty nine's."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1291240","1295240"," Even if it is going to roll over into."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1295240","1298240"," The clothes and we're going to have the doom and gloom coming."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1298240","1302240"," There might be an intraday trade here set itself up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1302240","1305240"," So what we'll do is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1305240","1308240"," We'll stand this one minute here and see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1308240","1311240"," A little bit of bottoming action coming into pluck trade right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1311240","1314240"," You got a higher low right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1314240","1319240"," So we might take a trade here with you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1319240","1323240"," The only thing that I would say to you would be."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1323240","1326240"," Don't think I would say to you would be."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1326240","1331240"," Don't don't hold any calls overnight."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1331240","1333240"," It would be the only thing that I'd say to you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1333240","1336240"," So we're going to watch this right now and see if."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1336240","1340240"," Watch this right now and see if this actually holds."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1340240","1347240"," Big rug right here right look at that rug."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1347240","1350240"," Let's see if this holds right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1350240","1353240"," Be watching this little lower band right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1353240","1359240"," Let's see if there's a way to buy a dip so."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1359240","1364240"," Here's s one right here with the downside target."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1377240","1396240"," So if you're like one of those one of those doom bears there's your downside target."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1396240","1400240"," All I'm looking for is for price."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1400240","1402240"," To break above right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1402240","1405240"," If it does."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1406240","1409240"," I'll take some calls to right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1409240","1411240"," Take that trade right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1411240","1414240"," It breaks above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1414240","1415240"," Tries to do this kind of thing."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1415240","1416240"," I'll reenter right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1416240","1417240"," Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1417240","1419240"," So there's a trade right here for bulls here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1419240","1423240"," There's a trade right here as well for bulls into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1436240","1441240"," We've got four thirty nine C set up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1441240","1449240"," Haven't bought him yet but."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1449240","1450240"," Show the bull show."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1450240","1453240"," See me in show the bull case here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1466240","1483240"," I've got four thirty nine C's twenty five pack so let's see what happens here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1483240","1488240"," Into this close some long S and P five hundred."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1488240","1494240"," With calls here we're going to see if we can catch this trade higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1494240","1499240"," I'm looking for that trade right there that trade right there and that trade."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1499240","1503240"," Right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1503240","1506240"," Thirty three cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1506240","1512240"," Let's do it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1512240","1520240"," Squeeze an hour now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1520240","1523240"," Those are zero dates."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1524240","1529240"," Those are August twenty seconds."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1529240","1535240"," Trading thirty three cents right now they're trading twenty five just a moment ago."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1535240","1537240"," Thirty two cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1537240","1545240"," You likely have another chance to get on these the likely be a quick role right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1545240","1552240"," Need to stay on track right here at any point we get red bars down here and we panicking trying to get out of my position."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1553240","1559240"," Let's just watch this right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1559240","1564240"," Oh yeah baby."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1564240","1565240"," Hey what's going on Willem?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1565240","1566240"," How are you doing?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1566240","1569240"," Having some issues with stream labs today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1569240","1572240"," It's failing the post streams for me."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1572240","1575240"," I don't know if it's called my."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1575240","1577240"," Called the fiber service."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1577240","1580240"," I've got a TT fiber now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1580240","1585240"," And they said it wasn't done their end to call them back and then I've been trying to keep trying to post videos and I can't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1585240","1589240"," It's like just it's like I'm getting these fail messages."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1589240","1598240"," I don't know exactly why."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1598240","1601240"," Yeah Binky it's like."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1601240","1605240"," You're setting up for a pretty decent down move here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1605240","1611240"," It's it's it's not looking good for bulls like this is not the."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1611240","1614240"," Bulls bulls here right inside here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1614240","1616240"," Not having a good day."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1616240","1630240"," Bears or sellers are setting this up for a big move down into Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1631240","1639240"," So for me what I'm looking at so every morning to give a good question so every morning my daughter."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1639240","1641240"," Wrote a program."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1641240","1645240"," With the help of surge and."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1645240","1649240"," So every morning between I think it's eight thirty and nine thirty."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1649240","1653240"," Takes a reading for options."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1653240","1657240"," In the stock market and she looks at SPX."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1657240","1661240"," She looks at spy but spy specifically."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1661240","1663240"," Is the one that I'm always looking at."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1663240","1666240"," I'm always looking at the spy options."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1666240","1673240"," Now these come out from yesterday so all that data comes from yesterday's options."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1673240","1678240"," And then today's zero dates are not calculated into those numbers."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1678240","1683240"," It's one of the challenges with gamma models is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1683240","1686240"," That they're like a day old they're like a day old and there's."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1686240","1689240"," Certain times of the day where."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1689240","1694240"," The models are worse than other times of the day like take a reading."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1694240","1699240"," Late afternoon or something that the gamma models are all crazy."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1699240","1702240"," Seems like the best gamma model is from the morning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1702240","1705240"," Like nine thirty in the morning from the previous day."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1705240","1708240"," It like calms down I think it's eight thirty or nine thirty."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1708240","1710240"," I have to ask her and find out what she says."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1711240","1714240"," Now so you've got two different models of options."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1714240","1718240"," So you like your put call ratio is always a day late."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1718240","1721240"," From yesterday's reading."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1721240","1726240"," That then today's implied ball."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1726240","1736240"," Can be used to find new or new calls and puts that are zero dates that come into the marketplace."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1736240","1744240"," Let me see if I can find some for you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1744240","1748240"," So for me I'm looking for two things I'm looking for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1748240","1753240"," Anyone that'll tell anyone that'll tell me zero dates that are coming into the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1753240","1759240"," And that are aren't part of the call and put structure in the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1759240","1763240"," The best way that I found to find that is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1764240","1769240"," The best freeway is a implied volatility suite would do it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1769240","1776240"," And that would show you zero dates coming into the marketplace on any or an S on spy or SPX."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1776240","1778240"," But spy specifically."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1778240","1780240"," Is what I'd be looking for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1780240","1784240"," And we say I bring one up for you right now hold on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1784240","1789240"," And the other way that I use is tasty shows."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1789240","1793240"," One of the most fascinating things to like about tasty is that it shows."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1793240","1798240"," Calls and puts for zero dates that enter entering and exiting the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1798240","1801240"," You can actually you can actually watch in real time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1801240","1808240"," Like hundreds of thousands of calls and puts enter the market then exit the market enter the market next to market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1808240","1814240"," Depending upon where we are."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1814240","1819240"," Maybe you guys are just joining right now. I'll review this one more time for you guys."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1819240","1824240"," I don't use I use the only thing that I use option AI for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1824240","1831240"," Is they have some really good if you do a Google search for options dot AI."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1831240","1836240"," Do options dot AI space bar and then do earnings."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1836240","1840240"," And one of their free tools which is awesome."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1840240","1849240"," Is it gives you the implied move for an earnings call right for their next expiry."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1849240","1853240"," So I'll use the so that's what I use them for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1853240","1856240"," They're quick and a quick and dirty way to see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1856240","1862240"," The IV on a stock, but it's it's old data. It's a dale. It's dale data."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1862240","1868240"," And we know that when banks are not buying or selling."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1868240","1872240"," That implied volatility for the day."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1872240","1879240"," Can swing markets right you can swing a market. It's like 10% of the market is being swung by options."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1879240","1885240"," When there is not real money buying or real money selling."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1885240","1888240"," So I'm going to bring one up for you right now."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","1896240","1899240"," One quick second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1899240","1902240"," Unnamed unnamed."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1902240","1905240"," What does this one do."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1905240","1910240"," Let's see if there's anything on this one. No, it's not. This is the blank chart."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1910240","1915240"," With volume on it. So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1915240","1920240"," This suite is called if you go to."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1921240","1924240"," Sometimes I'll use this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1925240","1929240"," Right here who makes this who makes this chart."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1935240","1939240"," Who makes this chart. See they can."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1942240","1946240"," They bring this over for you and show you this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1947240","1949240"," So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1949240","1953240"," This is a trigger screen right here. I brought up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1953240","1959240"," This guy's name is S E G A R K O."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1959240","1962240"," He has an implied volatility suite."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1962240","1967240"," On trading views open for anybody to read."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1967240","1973240"," This is the about menu here. You want to read through this here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1974240","1979240"," And this can give you kind of a like a cheap way like not paying for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1979240","1981240"," To find out."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1981240","1986240"," Buying calls selling calls buying puts selling puts on an intraday basis."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1986240","1990240"," So there it is right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1990240","1994240"," And it's right here right now, right? So."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1994240","1997240"," What are we going to do? This is a 30 minute chart."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","1998240","2006240"," So get a spy really quick."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2006240","2011240"," It's a kind of."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2011240","2022240"," Turn that off there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2023240","2027240"," And you can see how."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2027240","2033240"," All this red here, right? All this red here. You got the green right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2033240","2037240"," You got this green right here, right? What's this green telling you?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2037240","2041240"," Green telling you that we're not where they were done going down, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2041240","2044240"," And see all that all this green right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2044240","2048240"," Let me see if I put it on a five minute chart to get a better read on this stuff."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2053240","2055240"," I wonder if you could improve this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2055240","2070240"," One day here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2070240","2074240"," I don't know if I like this suite. I don't know if I said this is a good suite, but"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2074240","2081240"," not really happy. Let's look at it in one minute time frame here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2082240","2084240"," I don't know if I'm happy with this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2084240","2087240"," They're telling you that they're buying calls right now, still buying calls down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2087240","2090240"," Tons of call buying."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2090240","2093240"," So hopefully they're hopefully there with me. This is a one minute chart."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2093240","2096240"," So it says that they're buying calls right now, not buying puts."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2096240","2100240"," So we'll see if this actually works out today. We're going to switch back over"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2100240","2103240"," and see if we continue higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2103240","2105240"," So we'll see how this works itself out right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2105240","2108240"," Supposedly they're buying a bunch of calls right in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2109240","2111240"," We'll see if we're going up or not. We'll see if this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2111240","2115240"," This implied vol suite is actually telling the truth."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2125240","2126240"," Yeah, so William."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2126240","2130240"," William made just down saying I have one function that pulls options chain data"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2130240","2132240"," from Yahoo and does a simple IV calc."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2132240","2136240"," Just feed it to a ticker. I think the option is days like 15 minutes delayed."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2136240","2138240"," Yeah, absolutely. That'll do it too."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2138240","2141240"," Usually I'm looking for it. Usually when I'm looking for it,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2141240","2145240"," I'm looking for like there's an argument being made right now"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2145240","2148240"," that dealers are not trading in spy."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2148240","2153240"," And that there's no manipulation inside of the spy specific complex"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2153240","2156240"," that it's not being used to manipulate the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2156240","2160240"," And I contend that that is not the case that they are using"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2161240","2165240"," zero day puts and calls to manipulate the market price."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2165240","2169240"," I don't know who's doing it. I think it's dealers, but I'm not sure."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2169240","2171240"," Whoever's doing it has a ton of money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2171240","2177240"," Or they have more money in the underlying like they're long underlying."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2177240","2182240"," And it's such a it's such a vast number that they're using the options chain."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2182240","2187240"," And that that might doesn't cost them what they at what they actually own of the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2188240","2191240"," Squeeze an hour now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2191240","2196240"," Straight and 34 cents on four twenty nine C's."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2196240","2201240"," See if the bulls have it here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2210240","2214240"," Let me see if I can scroll over and see what's going on here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2214240","2216240"," See what's going on Twitch."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2220240","2225240"," Yeah, so the so that this implied ball suite is saying that's been called by and"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2225240","2227240"," call by and call by and call by two."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2232240","2234240"," Squeeze an hour now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2234240","2237240"," But I see that the bulls can do it. Can you do it? Bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2238240","2240240"," Can you do it?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2241240","2243240"," We turn that off."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2244240","2248240"," Turn that off. Turn that back on. Don't need to listen to this new squawk."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2250240","2253240"," So S&P 500 did some downgrading."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2254240","2256240"," Everybody's on downgrade happiness."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2258240","2260240"," Makes you wonder who's making these."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2261240","2264240"," Makes you wonder who's actually making these decisions."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2265240","2267240"," It's never like it's never easier simple."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2268240","2272240"," Why these decisions are being made or who's the hand behind the decisions being made."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2273240","2274240"," I always find that fascinating."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2275240","2277240"," Like Fitch S&P 500."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2281240","2282240"," 30 minute chart."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2285240","2287240"," Trading 36 cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2290240","2293240"," You got to jump on stream and can't leave you guys hanging."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2298240","2300240"," That would suck it here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2310240","2312240"," What am I looking for here?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2327240","2328240"," I'm looking for more."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2353240","2356240"," Short term velocity seems to support a move up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2358240","2359240"," No, it doesn't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2359240","2363240"," Short term velocity is not bullish right now at all."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2364240","2366240"," You're actually looking for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2366240","2368240"," I'm looking for some kind of a."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2371240","2373240"," I'm looking for some kind of a trade up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2374240","2377240"," And then a roll into this close here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2378240","2381240"," So just I'm looking for just squeezing here. Nothing bullish."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2382240","2384240"," Bulls need to get above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2385240","2386240"," For it to become bullish again."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2389240","2392240"," For it to become bullish again, you'd need to see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2393240","2415240"," To get bullish again, you would need to see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2418240","2419240"," This half million here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2420240","2425240"," You'd need to get above this 439 20ish right in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2427240","2429240"," And I don't care how high you go."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2429240","2431240"," I don't care if it's here or here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2432240","2436240"," But then you would need to consolidate and begin to move higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2438240","2442240"," To get bullish once again, that would be your trade somewhere in there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2443240","2450240"," And do I see that trade for you as a bull?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2450240","2451240"," I don't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2453240","2455240"," And why don't I see that trade for you?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2455240","2458240"," It was because someone out there looks like a dealer has all these calls here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2459240","2463240"," So they're going to try to force a close that's lower."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2465240","2470240"," So those calls don't print and you're going to get the debt the down day tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2470240","2473240"," So I don't actually think this is bad here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2473240","2475240"," So this is just a pullback."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2475240","2478240"," In my view, this is just a pullback to buy a dip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2478240","2482240"," But the fact that a dip wasn't bought up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2483240","2484240"," Is concerning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2485240","2489240"," The fact that you came all the way down to trend down here is concerning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2490240","2493240"," The fact that you're doing it on Tuesday for."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2494240","2499240"," You know, like Wednesday, Wednesday, Thursday events that we have coming up is concerning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2499240","2501240"," So we'll look at the economic calendar."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2502240","2503240"," We've got."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2505240","2510240"," PMI coming up manufacturing and services PMI coming up tomorrow at nine forty five."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2510240","2511240"," We have new home sales at 10."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2512240","2516240"," Then we've got all the dog shit being spewed on Thursday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2517240","2519240"," That's a Jackson's hole."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2519240","2522240"," And then we've got Friday same kind of a thing at 10 a.m."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2523240","2525240"," So I'm assuming here that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2526240","2532240"," My assumption here is that traders are going to, you know, investors and traders are going to hedge this market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2533240","2535240"," Now that you're under the hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2536240","2540240"," You're going to be looking for that, that continuation to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2540240","2542240"," And the key point here is that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2544240","2545240"," It doesn't really matter."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2546240","2551240"," If we get bad news or not from Jackson hole, it doesn't matter what they say."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2552240","2556240"," They're going to put the hedge on regardless of what you think or I think."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2557240","2558240"," Is going to happen."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2558240","2559240"," So what happens is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2560240","2562240"," Before we get to Jackson hole, they're going to put the hedge on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2562240","2564240"," We're going to go down into Jackson hole likely."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2565240","2569240"," And then the news doesn't matter. We squeeze back up higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2570240","2571240"," They take a victory lap."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2571240","2576240"," So they did their job and then the market is free to move on about its business."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2577240","2579240"," So just myself into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2580240","2585240"," If you aren't able to get up here, right of call, if you see the price doesn't get up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2586240","2588240"," Price doesn't start to trade higher into this bell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2589240","2592240"," It's going to be a, it's going to be no bueno for buyers."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2594240","2597240"," It's going to be a skull and crossbones here for buyers."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2598240","2601240"," If you're just joining us, I'm going to review this one more time for you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2602240","2605240"," So if you're just getting here and you're like, Cap, what are you talking about?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2606240","2607240"," I'm going to talk about it one more time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2608240","2611240"," I am long calls right now for one more squeeze up into the close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2612240","2613240"," Although I don't like."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2615240","2617240"," I don't like how we are closing here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2618240","2619240"," Not a fan of how we're closing here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2620240","2621240"," So we'll go back and look at it one more time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2622240","2623240"," Some of you guys have already heard this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2624240","2625240"," We'll do it one more time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2626240","2627240"," So just on a."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2629240","2631240"," Let's look at a five minute here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2632240","2634240"," So this is trend going higher, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2635240","2640240"," You expect the dip by expect the dip by you expect the dip by here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2641240","2642240"," Everything looks honky Dory, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2643240","2644240"," We hit bottom."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2644240","2645240"," Everything's awesome sauce, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2646240","2647240"," Boom, boom. Yahoo."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2648240","2650240"," Let's do it one more time and make it higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2650240","2653240"," Let's get up here to where these real sellers are to the upside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2654240","2655240"," And what are you noticing today?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2656240","2657240"," It's a little bit different than previous examples."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2659240","2662240"," Is the the hourly trigger was lower, okay?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2666240","2669240"," And we're now breaking through hourly trigger, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2671240","2673240"," Price is being pinned underneath hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2674240","2675240"," There's a ton of."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2675240","2676240"," Calls in the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2677240","2680240"," Almost a half million of them to prevent price from going up today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2681240","2682240"," Right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2682240","2683240"," That's a problem."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2684240","2687240"," And then on trend, we know we have a large event coming up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2690240","2694240"," We know we have a major event coming up later in the week and just on trend right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2695240","2696240"," This is our early trend, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2697240","2698240"," It's back on the 14th."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2698240","2701240"," We want you to pay attention to 27 EMA on an hourly."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2702240","2703240"," And you'll see right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2704240","2707240"," We had the failure underneath broke below, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2708240","2710240"," And then started making our way down, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2711240","2713240"," Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, boom, bottom on Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2714240","2715240"," That's the same setup."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2715240","2717240"," This setup right here is the same setup that's forming right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2719240","2721240"," And then we're going to go ahead and see what we're going to do."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2721240","2723240"," We're going to go ahead and see what we're going to do."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2724240","2725240"," The same setup that we're going to do next."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2726240","2728240"," We're going to go ahead and see what we're going to do next, we're going to go ahead and see what we're going to do next."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2730240","2731240"," That's the same setup."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2732240","2733240"," The same setup that's forming right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2734240","2735240"," So you can see this yellow line right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2736240","2737240"," This is the continuation to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2745240","2746240"," So is this a bull trap becomes the question, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2747240","2748240"," It's the same idea right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2748240","2750760"," So what do bulls need to do in this close?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2750760","2752800"," They didn't like they need to get up,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2752800","2754680"," like they don't have a chance, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2754680","2757460"," If we don't price doesn't begin to break up higher,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2759440","2761880"," can't get this action into this close right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2761880","2763400"," What happens?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2763400","2766600"," Start falling that trend to the downside here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2766600","2768400"," So this is not looking good for bulls here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2768400","2772720"," There's nothing bullish about this at this moment."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2772720","2775200"," There's nothing bullish to say."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2775200","2779760"," Bella was not saying that it looks good for a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2779760","2784120"," And to that point, to that point right here,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2786280","2787760"," going over to the trigger screen,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2789000","2792000"," you can see that same action right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2792000","2795280"," A little bit of bullishness here, not crazy bullishness,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2795280","2798120"," failure to extend, all that kind of stuff."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2798120","2799720"," And all that's right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2801640","2804560"," Coming back into neutral, excuse me, neutral here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2804560","2808920"," Still have new lows on daily value to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2808920","2809760"," That's not bullish."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2809760","2813800"," We want to see higher yellow lines not seeing that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2813800","2818800"," So this is pointing towards another role right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2824400","2825440"," Another role right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2825440","2826280"," It's right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2826280","2827120"," You can see it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2829200","2831280"," So you're looking for this other role right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2831280","2834280"," We'll see what happens into the close today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2835000","2840000"," Let's see right here, and switch back over here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2844440","2846440"," One minute chart right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2848600","2849760"," Still long calls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2849760","2853200"," So just inside of here, what are you looking for to this close?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2853200","2857360"," These bears want to stay underneath this hour"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2857360","2861360"," and they want to, they want to rain held down upon you"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2861360","2862360"," for the next two days."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2863360","2868360"," So right in here, rain this down and trap you if you're a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2870360","2872360"," So not a good place for bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2872360","2876360"," If you're like bullish into Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2876360","2878360"," bears telling you now we've got you trapped in here"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2878360","2884360"," and you're going to pay the price into Wednesday, Thursday,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2884360","2886360"," Friday, and it makes sense."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2886360","2890360"," If you're along this market, you're going to hedge into Friday"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2890360","2894360"," regardless of what the news is going to be in two Thursday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2894360","2896360"," So hoping that we can get up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2896360","2897360"," Hold on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2904360","2906360"," Hope is to get up in two minutes."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2906360","2907360"," Five minutes."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2907360","2908360"," Sellers."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2912360","2915360"," Hoping that we could at least trade up into where these major sellers"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2915360","2917360"," were put another hedge on for Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2917360","2919360"," Not showing itself right now, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2919360","2922360"," Not showing itself for that Thursday, Friday, doom."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2924360","2926360"," Showing itself right up in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2930360","2931360"," And no will."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2932360","2935360"," From bulls to buy down here in the early to show that extension."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2937360","2941360"," At this moment, none of that is being shown in the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2941360","2946360"," So I would say hold your, hold your pants into Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2947360","2953360"," And hold your pants into Friday and not looking good for bulls down here into."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2956360","2958360"," Into the rest of this week here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2958360","2961360"," So if you're a bear or if you're, if you're a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2962360","2965360"," If you're a bull for Friday, anything like that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2966360","2969360"," I would be sitting on your hands until Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2969360","2971360"," But if I was a bull, I'd be like, yeah, it's waited out."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2971360","2973360"," We'll wait until Friday and then."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2973360","2978360"," Wait until Friday and then along the market, depending on what the Fed says."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2987360","2988360"," Yeah, it looks like a dead cap."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2988360","2989360"," Bounce, doesn't it?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2989360","2990360"," Absolutely."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2990360","2991360"," It looks like a dead cap bounce."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2991360","2993360"," Looks like a trap for bulls in this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","2996360","3000360"," All this up here, all this bullshit up here, like you can't, you know, you know, you"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3000360","3003360"," should not pass for 40, any of that kind of stuff."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3003360","3006360"," There's someone out there saying that they don't want the market to go above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3007360","3008360"," For 40 up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3008360","3010360"," There's someone, there's a market participant out there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3010360","3011360"," It's like, fuck you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3011360","3013360"," No, we're not going up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3013360","3014360"," We're going down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3020360","3022360"," Yeah, you're getting access to it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3022360","3026360"," I've got a guys building out tools for you guys right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3026360","3028360"," So you guys are going to get access to it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3031360","3034360"," With a little conviction on either side."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3034360","3036360"," Is it easier for deals to pin?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3036360","3038360"," No, there's, I've got conviction."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3038360","3041360"," My conviction is to the downside, not the upside here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3042360","3044360"," Conviction right now is to the downside."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3044360","3047360"," Ultimately, we lead a path lower here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3048360","3051360"," I've got conviction bearish in a Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3052360","3055360"," Unless you get above the early trigger and test it and hold it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3056360","3060360"," Bearish conviction, 100% conviction on that 100%."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3061360","3063360"," So there's no like no conviction here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3064360","3067360"," If you're, if you're a bull, you have no trade unless you get above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3068360","3070360"," You have no trade unless you get above here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3071360","3074360"," And even here, even being above here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3075360","3080360"," Your next trade is only conviction to 445, I believe."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3081360","3082360"," Yeah, 445."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3082360","3084360"," Your next trade, if you're a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3085360","3088360"," Your only conviction can be to here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3090360","3092360"," That's the only conviction for a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3096360","3098360"," Any bull that tells you otherwise is out of their mind."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3098360","3100360"," They don't know what they're talking about."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3101360","3105360"," And even then you have to get above the four 40s, five, four 40s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3105360","3106360"," Time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3107360","3109360"," We get a welcoming remarks from Fedschoolsby."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3110360","3113360"," Later on, just over an hour's time, we get comments from Fedschoolsby and Bowman."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3114360","3115360"," Speaking at a fireside chat as well."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3116360","3118360"," Again, Gooseby just giving a welcoming remarks at the bottom of the hour."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3119360","3122360"," Even then you, you have to be above that four 45, four 47."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3123360","3127360"," Have the hourly trigger come up for you and you have to retest that with the daily."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3128360","3129360"," So the Fed Listens event is on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3130360","3133360"," The employment media is allowed and we have provided it on the feed for anybody interested."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3134360","3140360"," The text is still yet to be determined just on, on sure how much monetary policy talk will hear from these opening remarks."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3141360","3143360"," So I'm on calls right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3144360","3146360"," I think that we squeeze up into the close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3147360","3150360"," My concern here is where do we squeeze to?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3151360","3153360"," Do we, do we not get above this four 40c?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3154360","3158360"," Do we not get above the four 39 20?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3159360","3162360"," Do we only get to this four 38 84?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3163360","3164360"," So that's my concern."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3164360","3165360"," I'm bullish here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3165360","3168360"," So maybe I may explain it better on a one day."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3169360","3173360"," I'm bullish on three more sessions, four more sessions."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3174360","3175360"," I'm pretty fucking bearish right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3176360","3178360"," It's not looking good for bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3179360","3181360"," So in do bulls have a trade?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3182360","3185360"," No, you have to be above our price hourly daily."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3186360","3187360"," Remember that price."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3188360","3191360"," I got it written down on a, on a white paper price hourly daily."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3191360","3193360"," You can buy a dip and go long."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3194360","3195360"," We're not there yet."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3195360","3200360"," So all bull can do is be tactful and taking longs like they can take it from here to here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3200360","3201360"," I got to wrap it up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3201360","3205360"," Let the all goes do what they want to do and then take that trade again."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3205360","3207360"," Same thing on down below here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3209360","3210360"," Look down here this morning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3211360","3212360"," There's a one minute chart, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3213360","3215360"," There's actually a prime example here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3216360","3218360"," Use this as an example right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3218360","3219360"," Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3220360","3222360"," So this is the no go zone, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3222360","3225360"," You already knew this morning where this number was, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3226360","3228360"," This is your hourly trigger right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3229360","3231360"," Right? We bounced down on the hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3231360","3233360"," One, two and three."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3234360","3236360"," No, but before knowing any of this over here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3238360","3242360"," What are you looking for in here to to catch a ride higher, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3242360","3243360"," You already know, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3243360","3244360"," You already know, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3245360","3249360"," You know what you're looking for in here to catch the ride higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3250360","3254360"," You're looking for price to have come up, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3254360","3260360"," You're looking for that white line to turn right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3261360","3263360"," And you would watch the red line."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3265360","3266360"," Turn higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3266360","3267360"," Wait a minute here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3269360","3271360"," Red line to turn higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3272360","3276360"," And you would have gotten a confirmation trade back down here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3276360","3282360"," And then with confidence, you enter that trade long off the daily trigger or off the hourly trigger down below here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3283360","3284360"," Does that make sense?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3284360","3286360"," This is where you actually make entry here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3287360","3291360"," If you're trying to buy a dip down here, this is not the place to buy a dip, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3291360","3293360"," Not the place to buy a dip."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3293360","3300360"," You're trying to wait until price revert or goes above that trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3301360","3304360"," On a one minute basis, not seeing any of that in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3304360","3306360"," There was no trade for you."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3306360","3310360"," They might be wondering like, hey, Cap, why do you think we're going up into the close?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3312360","3314360"," Mostly because I think it's a trap."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3315360","3318360"," I think they're going to sell it here just like they did there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3318360","3319360"," They're going to sell it there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3319360","3321360"," This is where the sellers are, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3321360","3325360"," And they're going to try to come right back down in here and sell this right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3325360","3326360"," One, two and three."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3327360","3331360"," And they're likely going to step up on here and try to sell this down into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3336360","3339360"," And you've got these guys up here kind of ensuring it, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3343360","3344360"," 35 cents again."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3346360","3350360"," Again, surely expecting these welcoming amounts from that goes be a video is on the feed."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3357360","3361360"," Would I be taking any positions in VDA and they're earnings?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3361360","3362360"," No."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3363360","3364360"," Absolutely not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3365360","3370360"," I'm looking to, so I had a bunch of stocks trigger sell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3371360","3373360"," We could go at some point."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3373360","3376360"," I think it was Monday close or Tuesday open or something like that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3376360","3378360"," Two weeks ago or something like that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3379360","3380360"," I called."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3380360","3382360"," I figured it was talking to about it, but."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3383360","3385360"," I own some stuff still, but not a ton."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3385360","3387360"," So my next."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3388360","3392360"," For me, the next stuff that I'm buying is I'm going to buy S&P 500."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3394360","3403360"," So that's where I'm deploying the money to next S&P 500 mostly because of another time to manage all the stuff behind the scenes."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3404360","3406360"," 40 cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3406360","3411360"," So as expected, Feds Bowman, not commenting on Fed policy in the prepared remarks."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3412360","3419360"," Again, Bowman, not commenting on economic and monetary policy outlook in their prepared remarks at the Fed Listens events, I was expected."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3420360","3422360"," I'm going to switch over to."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3422360","3424360"," We'll talk about N VDA to hold on one second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3425360","3432360"," This dream is sponsored by the tick get free daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3432360","3434360"," At to the tick dot com."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3436360","3438360"," Let's bring this over here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3438360","3443360"," 39 cents right now to bring this over and then I'm going to chart."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3443360","3445360"," Do some charting for you to this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3445360","3446360"," So hold on here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3449360","3455360"," I'm actually going to put this on a natural gas September futures set like $2.56."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3455360","3460360"," Nine mixed diesel September futures set like $3.30 a gallon."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3460360","3462360"," And nine mixed gasoline September."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","3862360","3864360"," It's fairly simple."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3864360","3867360"," I think on an hourly trend, they're trying to sell this"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","3903360","3905360"," Those might print like 15."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3905360","3908360"," Maybe they, I guess maybe they could print, but I'm looking at"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3908360","3910360"," four thirties and then the price for puts right now is pretty"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3910360","3911360"," expensive for Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3913360","3915360"," I'm going to pay two bucks for puts."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3916360","3921360"," Four thirty sevens or two dollars and seven cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3921360","3923360"," I'm like, yeah."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","3927360","3928360"," They don't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3928360","3929360"," And they just go down in value."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3929360","3931360"," They don't hold any value."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3934360","3936360"," Puts aren't built to make money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3939360","3941360"," Bears want a better price."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3942360","3943360"," I agree with that."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","3948360","3949360"," thirties or two dollars."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3949360","3950360"," I'm like, yeah."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3953360","3955360"," It's kind of pricey for like five days from now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3957360","3959360"," So for the four thirty eights four thirty sevens."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3961360","3963360"," I guess they let me hold on a second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3971360","3973360"," Yeah, they're like, are they going to print six bucks?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3977360","3980360"," They'd have to print me six dollars by Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","3990360","3993360"," Bull's fighting back right now again, trying to come up and"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","4764360","4769360"," Don't like seeing the will of bulls being weak into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4769360","4772360"," So if you're just joining us right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4772360","4776360"," There is a setup here in the hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4776360","4779360"," To close below it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4779360","4783360"," And then you've got hourly trend over the rest of the week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4783360","4788360"," To tee off from the 20 70 a man on an hourly basis."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4788360","4790360"," We're going to switch over to an hour."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4790360","4792360"," So we're just tuning in right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4792360","4797360"," You can see it right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4797360","4799360"," Sellers trying to come in."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4799360","4802360"," Keep price below the hourly."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4802360","4808360"," So they can sell this close into tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4808360","4811360"," We're waiting to see what this close does here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4811360","4816360"," So just up in here that line is basically."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4816360","4821360"," Basically right here should be a white line, but."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4821360","4823360"," It's basically right in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4823360","4826360"," So you're waiting to see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4826360","4829360"," They sell this close on bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4829360","4836360"," If this is a bull trap."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4836360","4837360"," I'm in the wrong thing."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4837360","4845360"," Yeah, I am."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4845360","4846360"," So we'll see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4846360","4850360"," I'll probably switch to puts for tomorrow at some point in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4850360","4854360"," So wherever this goes here, I'll switch into puts for tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4854360","4856360"," So we'll start looking at those now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4856360","4859360"," So get some lower targets for tomorrow as well."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4859360","4863360"," Let's look at a five minute chart here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4863360","4867360"," And targets for tomorrow would include."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4867360","4872360"," Four thirty five and four thirty three."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4872360","4873360"," For tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4873360","4878360"," So we'll start taking a look at that now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4878360","4883360"," For puts for tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4883360","4887360"," Start looking at puts for tomorrow right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4887360","4898360"," Hold on here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4898360","4900360"," So four thirty five is only fifty six cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4900360","4902360"," That's pretty reasonably priced."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4902360","4905360"," And then we've got four thirty twos."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4906360","4907360"," Sixteen cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4907360","4909360"," Those are dirt cheap."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4909360","4915360"," So I might do a mix or a blend of both of those heading into tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4916360","4919360"," So I got them set up right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4919360","4923360"," Four thirty two four thirty five having bottom."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4923360","4925360"," For the twenty third."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4925360","4928360"," So as we head into this close here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4928360","4931360"," My expectation is that we trade up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4932360","4936360"," I don't think they were able to get to this four forty C."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4936360","4940360"," I think the market is pinned here with the calls that are on the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4940360","4942360"," They're not going to allow these normally."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4942360","4944360"," They don't allow these to close in the money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4944360","4946360"," Most most of the time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4946360","4948360"," So whatever."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4948360","4950360"," I think they're not going to allow these."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4950360","4952360"," They don't allow these to close in the money."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4952360","4953360"," Most of the time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4953360","4954360"," So whatever."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4955360","4958360"," Up we have here and then look to buy four thirty five and four thirty."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4958360","4962360"," Two P for tomorrow and see if we can get some down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4962360","4963360"," Down side action."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4963360","4965360"," I like the."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4965360","4969360"," I like the idea of the four thirty twos because of cheap there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4969360","4974360"," I like the idea but the four thirty five could come down to like twenty thirty cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4974360","4977360"," It'd be even more interested in those."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4978360","4980360"," So we're going to pay attention to this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4980360","4983360"," See how cheap we can get four thirty fives."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4983360","4985360"," For tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","4985360","4988360"," And see if we can hit those targets."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","5002360","5006360"," Try to trade this four thirty six maybe retest this low down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","5006360","5009360"," Do I think we can drain down into the closed over here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","5009360","5011360"," It's possible."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","5011360","5014360"," So just right in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","5014360","5019360"," The four thirty five."

"zqj-zpYXNSk","6610360","6613360"," I'm coming right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6613360","6619360"," I'm looking to see if this holds here so we'll see if this holds."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6620360","6621360"," What don't I want to see?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6621360","6623360"," I don't make a bunch of red bars."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6623360","6625360"," I don't want to see red bars down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6625360","6627360"," Definitely."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6627360","6635360"," I don't want to see green bars here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6635360","6638360"," And then red bars right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6638360","6640360"," Don't want to see anything like that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6640360","6644360"," This is what that leads to more down to come."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6644360","6652360"," What I'm looking for though is a green bar to pop its head above right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6652360","6655360"," Take another trade up into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6655360","6658360"," Just watching for this right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6658360","6661360"," Even catch these green bars up here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6661360","6666360"," Try to take these into the close right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6666360","6669360"," Do not want to see."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6669360","6672360"," We're going to watch what the interaction is right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6672360","6681360"," If they close this below or if we get above it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6681360","6686360"," We don't want to see a closing red bar here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6686360","6688360"," I don't want to see any of that stuff right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6688360","6689360"," See any of that?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6689360","6690360"," No bueno."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6703360","6705360"," It's so hot in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6705360","6709360"," So much emotion around this early trigger today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6717360","6720360"," Take a look at the 30 minute here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6727360","6730360"," Yeah, I'm not really a fan here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6731360","6733360"," Like for tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6733360","6736360"," Still not a fan."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6736360","6739360"," And this all looks good."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6739360","6741360"," All this structure looks good."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6741360","6743360"," This all looks good to go up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6743360","6748360"," But the fact that price isn't up here is a problem."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6748360","6754360"," Like price needs to be closing."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6755360","6760360"," Price needs to be closing above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6760360","6764360"," Price needs to close above this yellow right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6764360","6766360"," No closing above this yellow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6766360","6774360"," No good for bulls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6774360","6779360"," Long 439 C's for 26 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6785360","6786360"," Bulls have to close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6786360","6788360"," Keep your eyes on this here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6788360","6792360"," It's like a pin on the market trying to stop the market from closing any higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6792360","6794360"," Bulls need to close above this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6794360","6795360"," They don't have choice."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6795360","6797360"," And bulls have to close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6803360","6804360"," Close above."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6805360","6812360"," 439.25, I think."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6812360","6820360"," 439.25."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6820360","6825360"," So bulls, you have to close up here if you don't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6825360","6827360"," It's going to be nasty for you tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6827360","6830360"," So if you don't get this close here today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6831360","6833360"," I'm not a fan of."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6833360","6837360"," I'm not a fan of the bull case for the rest of the week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6837360","6840360"," So just above this number right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6840360","6852360"," So if you're a bull, you need to close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6853360","6854360"," Oh."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6854360","6862360"," Hold on a second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6862360","6865360"," I just added more 18 cents there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6865360","6870360"," So if you're a bull, right, you have to close above this number here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6870360","6872360"," No close above this number."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6872360","6875360"," You're you're gone by come tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6875360","6878360"," That would be my view that if you don't get above here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6879360","6884360"," If you don't close above this 439.25."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6884360","6886360"," I'm just going to make this lower here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6886360","6889360"," That is that 25 right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6889360","6893360"," So you need to close that today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6893360","6899360"," Otherwise, if no close above that 439.25 today,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6899360","6902360"," if there is no close up here today,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6902360","6906360"," I would not be long into Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6906360","6909360"," So that's that's their closing number right there if you're a bull."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6909360","6915360"," 439.25 right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6915360","6917360"," So we'll see if bulls can do it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6917360","6918360"," I don't know if they can."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6918360","6921360"," I think that I think that the setup is."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6921360","6924360"," If you're just joining us right now, we're going to give a quick."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6924360","6926360"," We're going to go back through and look."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6926360","6928360"," I'm going to give exactly what I gave this morning."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6928360","6930360"," This afternoon, early this afternoon."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6930360","6932360"," Give me a second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6932360","6935360"," We're going to look at one quick second here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6936360","6941360"," So it's 3 30 in the afternoon."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6941360","6945360"," We're going to go full screen here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6945360","6946360"," Okay."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6946360","6948360"," And we're going to give we're going to go."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6948360","6950360"," We're going to start an hour chart here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6950360","6954360"," So just on an hourly basis, you can probably do this on SPX."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6954360","6956360"," It'll be cleaner."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6956360","6961360"," So just right here on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6961360","6963360"," Specifically."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6964360","6967360"," On this date right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6967360","6970360"," This is where the rejection was here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6970360","6972360"," So right back here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6972360","6976360"," On the 15th."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6976360","6978360"," And you can actually see it better."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6978360","6981360"," There's a better there's a better example of this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6981360","6985360"," Was that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6985360","6988360"," So right back here, you can see right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6988360","6991360"," Squeeze up and then sold right back down, squeeze up, sold right back down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6991360","6993360"," This is hourly trend."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6993360","6996360"," And this is what they're trying to do again to you, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","6996360","7001360"," Come up, sell down, boom, boom, boom, back up, boom, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7001360","7005360"," Come back up and big gnarly death spiral down here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7005360","7008360"," So just right in here, kind of the same thing, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7008360","7010360"," Slam it down, sell it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7010360","7015360"," And then attempt to sell this down into Friday, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7015360","7020360"," So sellers stay in control here into this close and they're going to try to sell this right"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7020360","7026360"," back down into into Friday and try to capture that weekly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7026360","7034360"," So looking at spy."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7034360","7038360"," You can see a little bit more clear over here on or not as clear here in spy, but the same"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7038360","7039360"," existence, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7039360","7042360"," Sell it down, sell it down."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7042360","7044360"," Once we're underneath."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7044360","7046360"," The hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7047360","7048360"," Right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7048360","7051360"," Or excuse me, back here, we were above the hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7051360","7055360"," But right now, right now where we are, we are below the hourly trigger, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7055360","7061360"," So they want to keep us under the hourly trigger, keep us under the 27 EMA in the hourly down"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7061360","7066360"," here and try to sell us down into Thursday and Friday down here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7066360","7068360"," So you can see that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7068360","7071360"," So pull in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7072360","7077360"," I'm just going back here to a matter of fact, they're selling it right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7077360","7079360"," So I'm in call still right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7079360","7082360"," So just down inside of here, right, going into tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7082360","7085360"," This is a one minute chart right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7085360","7090360"," What are they looking for into tomorrow and into."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7090360","7095360"," Yeah, when Wednesday, excuse me, Thursday and then Friday way down there, they're going"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7095360","7099360"," to be wanting to target these these numbers down here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7099360","7100360"," A new low."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7100360","7103360"," That would put us at 434."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7103360","7106720"," 74 for tomorrow, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7106720","7109760"," You get that nice big sell down here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7109760","7112480"," They get underneath it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7112480","7119520"," Maybe into the bell or something and then they're trying to tag this low into Wednesday, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7119520","7123960"," Maybe you come back up and then you've got the Jerome Powell scare tactics and what are"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7123960","7130960"," you targeting into what into Friday is this price target down below here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7130960","7138960"," It's actually a 427."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7138960","7141960"," The price target is right down here at this 427."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7141960","7149520"," So just look at this right now into Friday, you get Wednesday, Thursday, Friday over here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7149520","7152640"," You can see the pinning action, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7152640","7154680"," Comes down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7154680","7155680"," Comes down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7155680","7159080"," You might not get that tomorrow, you might get that one."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7159080","7162960"," Then you get this bloodbath into Jerome Powell speaking."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7162960","7165840"," Now, does it matter what Jerome Powell says?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7165840","7166840"," Likely not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7166840","7171920"," Has more to do with hedging the market and getting paid for that hedge into the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7171920","7179320"," So into Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, if the bulls can't close, the bulls can't close this"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7179320","7186320"," out."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7186320","7191200"," If bulls can't close this out in here, it's going to look pretty bad tomorrow and I've"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7191200","7192200"," got calls still."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7192200","7193440"," They're eight cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7193440","7194440"," They're burning right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7194440","7200600"," I've got 50 calls on there down on like 60%, 70% of their value right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7200600","7205040"," So right down in here and you've got these half million calls that are on the market right"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7205040","7206040"," here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7206040","7207040"," Can we get up there?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7207040","7208040"," I don't know."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7208040","7212520"," They're going to be intended for us not to go up there and print those."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7212520","7216160"," So we'll see as we get into this close here what that means for tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7216160","7219280"," I should have bought those puts, never did."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7219280","7225120"," So we're going to watch this close right here into this close today and see what this means"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7225120","7226120"," into Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7226120","7231200"," Now, wherever we wind up into this close today, whether we are up here into this close, if"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7231200","7236120"," we magically come back up and hit that target, if we trade down to this bell, whatever that"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7236120","7241120"," may be, isn't going to matter to me, I'll buy those puts at that time."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7241120","7247360"," So I'm looking for puts, but not until we get into this after hours period, don't want"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7247360","7251280"," them right now want nothing to do with them."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7251280","7259240"," I guess I could want them if we broke below this stuff here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7259240","7265800"," I might want them if I might want them if we broke these buyers here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7265800","7269880"," We break these buyers right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7269880","7274440"," We break all these buyers right here, I probably buy some puts into the bell, but until we"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7274440","7278200"," break these buyers here, I don't know if you can see this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7278200","7285520"," We know there's buyers here, right here, right here, they're right here, they're right here,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7285520","7286520"," they're right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7286520","7289520"," We're going to find out if they're still here or not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7289520","7293440"," If they have lost, if they're like, yeah, bulls have lost, the buyers don't want any"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7293440","7294440"," of this."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7294440","7299600"," And to bearish, in a Friday, we'll then switch to a put side."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7299600","7321160"," Right now, still sitting here, trying to add to a position right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7321160","7328400"," I'm going to watch this into the clothes, see if these buyers are still here or if they're"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7328400","7329400"," gone."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7329400","7334040"," Let's look at a book map really quick and see if they're still here or not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7334040","7336680"," Yeah, they're still here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7336680","7339600"," They're still down here, they're right down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7339600","7346280"," So we'll see if these are real buyers or if they rug pull it here, see, I think they're"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7346280","7347280"," actually lower."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7347640","7359520"," It's actually like right here or something, they're right here, make that red."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7359520","7364200"," This is kind of it right here, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7364200","7367320"," It's kind of like the last draw for bulls, right?"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7367320","7371800"," Start breaking through this stuff here and it is on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7372800","7378800"," Let's see, it's slightly higher, like right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7378800","7388680"," There's a little bit more even lower right down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7388680","7393920"," Careful of this stuff down here, all this stink fitting going on down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7393920","7417480"," Let's somewhere down in here, that stink bit is right down here, come in here, stink"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7417480","7419640"," bit is like way down here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7419640","7427080"," So be careful of this downward move right here, play bear music here again, all this"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7427080","7430480"," drama sound, we're probably going to do this right here, probably going to squeeze this"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7430480","7436480"," down here, probably going to send that right down there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7436480","7444120"," Falls are now worth four cents, almost worthless here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7444120","7447320"," Still sitting in them right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7448320","7452880"," I added some at eight cents to try to try to try to kill some of this, because I bought"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7452880","7459200"," this down here, I think I bought, I think I bought this one or I bought, no, I bought"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7459200","7460200"," this one right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7460200","7471560"," And then I added right here at eight cents, we were right back down, going to watch this"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7471560","7478000"," close right here, 20 minutes, 22 minutes left till the end of the day, we'll see where"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7478000","7479800"," we wind up."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7479800","7484400"," No interest in buying puts, if you can break underneath this zone right here, I'd have"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7484400","7489560"," interest in puts for tomorrow, but without that break here, no interest right now until"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","7589760","7599560"," You can see those green bars in there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7600560","7624040"," What's that volume bar, 600,000, they're getting torched right now, watching the buyers"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7624040","7635800"," being weakened right here, trying, I'm thinking about adding more right here, but I'm not"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","7640600","7642360"," are going to be worthless anyways."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7655040","7661600"," I haven't added here, look at that rug pull right there, it's looking, look at that, nothing"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7661600","7668600"," down there, it's like straight nothing down there, it's like zero down there, no support,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7668600","7673600"," this is the entire support right here, there's the entire support of the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7684040","7709880"," I'm adding some calls here right now, I just added a bunch to a 439, well not a bunch,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7709880","7730360"," but then I added some 428s for the close, I'm kind of panicky here, I'm thinking to myself"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7730360","7735880"," like I have full intent for these things to just burn, like these things are definitely"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7735880","7755640"," fucking burned, let's keep an eye out here, come on now, turn around, don't give up your"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","7901120","7921080"," Oh they're trying to grind me out of this position right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7931120","7957120"," Just sitting here, waiting to see what they're going to do to me into this bell,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7961120","7986640"," and I'm not giving shit up on 439, 438s not doing as bad,"
"zqj-zpYXNSk","7986640","7994640"," they're like we're not paying you in 439, I'm like uh, you might."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8016640","8042640"," I'm not giving shit up on 439, I'm not giving shit up on 439, I'm not giving shit up on 439,"

"zqj-zpYXNSk","8140640","8144640"," HYG limping into the close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8144640","8147640"," VIX trading higher right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8147640","8149640"," Apple I guess a little bit of a roll."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8149640","8154640"," I shouldn't say recovering more of like a little bit of a roll into the bell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8154640","8161640"," Tesla with a better recovery."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8162640","8165640"," Dixie trading 106."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8165640","8170640"," 103.62 excuse me not 106 but 103.62."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8170640","8175640"," If Dixie hits 105 it's usually pretty bad."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8175640","8181640"," Right anywhere in that 105 area we start to get pretty nasty in the market."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8181640","8186640"," I said Nasdaq was recovering but I guess it wasn't."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8187640","8193640"," Nasdaq limping into the close here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8193640","8197640"," With a new low as well."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8197640","8201640"," They just took me for another penny on 4.29."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8201640","8204640"," They literally just ripped me for a penny."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8204640","8209640"," Fuck."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8209640","8214640"," Like even this green bar right here they just robbed me at 50% of this trade."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8214640","8222640"," Like 50% on that bar right there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8222640","8224640"," Still long on 4.38."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8224640","8225640"," 4.39."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8225640","8229640"," C's haven't sold now I'm not selling now they just now they just stay on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8229640","8232640"," Both sides stay on to the closing bell here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8232640","8234640"," I don't care where we go into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8234640","8238640"," They stay on until 4 p.m. probably 4.15."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8238640","8241640"," See if they can get some green bars up into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8242640","8247640"," Us closing here into if we close below."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8247640","8251640"," 4.39.25."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8251640","8254640"," Looking for end of the week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8254640","8262640"," On Friday looking for a price target into Friday of 4.27."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8262640","8267640"," So 4.27 between now and Friday possibly Monday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8268640","8270640"," Looking for 4.35."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8270640","8273640"," 4.34 for tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8273640","8275640"," And then we're going to look at it real quick here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8275640","8280640"," So just into if no close above here today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8280640","8283640"," If no close above 4.30."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8283640","8285640"," Or I say 4.39."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8285640","8291640"," 25 if no close above here today looking for Wednesday a low of 4.35."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8291640","8292640"," 4.34."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8292640","8296640"," By Thursday a close below 4.33."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8296640","8304640"," And then Friday looking for a price target of 4.27."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8304640","8307640"," Right down you can see it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8307640","8312640"," Right down here for Friday so somewhere down in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8312640","8316640"," Price target into Friday 4.27."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8316640","8319640"," That would be the big dinger down in there."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8319640","8325640"," Maybe if you rain it in for Friday 4.35s for somewhere in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8325640","8329640"," It would give you the room that you need to get down into here and start printing hard and heavy."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8329640","8335640"," So Friday 4.35 seems like the trade into tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8335640","8341640"," We're going to watch this close right here and see if we close below."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8341640","8343640"," I'm still long calls here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8343640","8351640"," I want to see if we can trade this up and get above into this bell here for bulls to save themselves."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8351640","8357640"," Kind of do or die here for bulls into kind of do or die here for bulls into rest of week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8357640","8361640"," Like second half of week where do we go kind of stuff."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8361640","8364640"," So we're going to watch here and see what happens in this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8364640","8365640"," I'm long these calls."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8365640","8366640"," I'm long."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8366640","8369640"," So I've got 4.38s 4.39s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8369640","8370640"," I'm not selling."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8370640","8373640"," I'm like, I'm getting, I didn't get torched in the 4.38s from the 4.39s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8373640","8376640"," They're like, yeah, fuck you, we're not printing those."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8376640","8379640"," And that's even if we go up to here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8379640","8381640"," They're not printing those 4.39s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8381640","8383640"," They'll be at zero by open or by close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8383640","8384640"," So they're not going to matter."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8384640","8387640"," So I'm just going to leave those on the 4.38s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8387640","8390640"," I'm leaving on right now just in case you continue to go higher."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8390640","8396640"," If we trade higher into this close and we don't get above, we get somewhere like right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8396640","8404640"," Anything like down here, I'm going to put some 4.35s on for Friday for Friday at the close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8404640","8407640"," 4 o'clock, 4.15, something like that."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8407640","8412640"," And see if we can get, if we can get that trade going into the close today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8412640","8418640"," So right here, bulls have to close above 4.39, 25 to stay alive for the rest of the week."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8418640","8423640"," If that doesn't happen on this close, look to heads yourself."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8423640","8433640"," If you're a bull, I warn you that you have no trade into rest of week unless you get above this number right here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8433640","8435640"," And you need to confirm it as well."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8435640","8438640"," You need to like come up here, stay above it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8438640","8445640"," And you can take that trade right there, but you've got nothing until you get above 4.39."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8445640","8450640"," 25 and hold it."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8450640","8456640"," We know if you're short right now, did you take the money and run down here or do you still just you just max short a bit."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8456640","8476640"," That's what I would guess is that you just max short."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8476640","8481640"," Six minutes left until about close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8481640","8492640"," I got to look at some puts here for Friday. Hold on."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8492640","8509640"," There are $1.59 for Friday for 32 or 80 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8509640","8514640"," Too expensive for my blood to expense. Oh, we're squeezing up right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8514640","8520640"," There goes that squeeze."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8520640","8525640"," Oh, I got two cents back now. 40 cents on 4.38."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8525640","8540640"," Oh, they give me two pennies on. They give me one penny back on 4.39s, but I'm trading 40 cents on 4.38s right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8540640","8542640"," Now they're 32 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8542640","8545640"," Squeeze and higher here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8545640","8552640"," There's four minutes left into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8552640","8558640"," Four more minutes to make some money back."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8558640","8564640"," Come on, baby."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8564640","8572640"," Oh, this is going to be another mic drop close. Oh, it might be."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8573640","8578640"," Don't let it happen."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8578640","8582640"," Don't let it happen."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8582640","8590640"," I don't think I'm going to get it, but I don't think I'm going to get these last few bars."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8590640","8594640"," It's showing itself in here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8595640","8598640"," Oh, now down to 31 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8598640","8601640"," 35 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8601640","8610640"," One penny on four. I should have taken the two pennies on 4.39."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8610640","8616640"," They gave me an option to get out here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8616640","8623640"," Come on, last two big green bars. Give me one big green bar into this close."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8624640","8627640"," I'm going to end up adding some puts here after the bell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8627640","8632640"," No matter where we wind up here, you'll see me buy puts for Friday here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8632640","8637640"," I don't want to buy the fucking 4.35s. They're stupid expensive."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8637640","8641640"," Maybe the 4.32s I'll buy."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8641640","8645640"," They're so expensive for going down there. They're so, so pricey."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8645640","8650640"," It's like a big eat like 100 of those. It's going to be a pretty, pretty big trade."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8650640","8664640"," I don't want to buy 100 of those."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8664640","8676640"," It's like 4.32s or 76 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8676640","8693640"," Still long right now. I'm looking to set a trade up for after the bell here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8693640","8698640"," I'm going to get a 4.32s for Friday. They're 75 cents, 76 cents right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8698640","8710640"," So we'll see if we can catch this, catch this green bar into the bell here and see if I can buy some cheap puts for Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8710640","8714640"," Two minutes left."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8714640","8717640"," Still long here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8717640","8731640"," Trading 35 cents in one penny here."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8731640","8746640"," Two pennies now on 4.39s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8746640","8754640"," Nope."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8754640","8759640"," Trying to get one penny off of 4.39. I just sold out of 4.39s."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8759640","8766640"," Now just sitting in 4.28s right now for 4.38. Excuse me."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8766640","8775640"," I'm getting drained right here right on the spell."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8775640","8779640"," Still long 4.38s. They're up to 40 cents at one point. Never took the profit on them."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8779640","8787640"," Now they're trading 11 cents on the bell right here. 12 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8787640","8792640"," Now they're trading 19 cents, 18 cents."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8792640","8797640"," 23 cents, 22. They're all over the fucking place."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8797640","8807640"," Still long calls here. Now they're 16 cents again. 8 up here in the after hours."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8807640","8824640"," 8 up. So bulls, no close above 4.39. 25 expectation is down overnight selling this 4.39 at every opportunity in the overnight expectations for price targets tomorrow."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8824640","8831640"," 4.35, 4.34."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8831640","8840640"," Just bought puts for Friday bought 4.32 P's just now for Friday 4.32 P."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8840640","8845640"," I think we can hit that 4.32 easily into Friday."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8845640","8853640"," We'll seeing the will of buyers here not showing up on Tuesday looks like they're setting up for that Friday down move."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8853640","8857640"," Failure to get above 27 EMA on an hourly trigger."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8857640","8864640"," So I am now long puts into Friday. I still own 4.38 C's right now."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8864640","8871640"," And so into the next like 15 minutes or so I'm going to try to cut those loose here and just get rid of them."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8871640","8873640"," So I'll see all of you guys tomorrow at 9.30."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8873640","8879640"," I'm having issues right now with stream labs like failure to post videos. I don't know what that means."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8879640","8887640"," But I was trying to put live streams up this morning and I wasn't getting any connection through stream labs to the internet."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8887640","8897640"," So I don't know exactly why that's happening. I had to reboot my computer and then reset all of stream labs like rebuild all of stream labs to put a stream out for you today."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8897640","8902640"," So we'll see what goes. We'll see what happens tomorrow with stream labs and see if it gets a bit of gear or not."
"zqj-zpYXNSk","8902640","8910640"," You might see me run a stream or two today. I'm going to turn the stream off and run a couple live streams."
