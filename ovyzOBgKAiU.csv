"89070","134700"," Welcome back to the market brief."
"134740","135860"," We'll try to be quick about this."
"146130","147730"," All right, good morning out there. "
"147850","148630"," How y'all doing?"
"150310","151870"," We've got a hell of a day coming up."
"151970","152650"," We don't we legend."
"153070","154230"," It's going to be a big one. "
"154510","159330"," I mean, I was trying to think I was trying to wrap my head around it this morning."
"159330","166930"," And all of the volatility surrounding what can he say?"
"167370","167890"," What can he do?"
"168170","173430"," Can he raise rates today or not raise rates or cuts or whatever?"
"174770","177170"," There's an inevitability here, right?"
"177470","182050"," I think that's the key point is that there is an inevitability."
"182970","191630"," Whether he cuts rates today or he cuts them on his next decision, he doesn't have much more room is"
"191630","192150"," the point. "
"192910","193510"," Right?"
"193710","197650"," What is the argument become today if he doesn't cut rates, right?"
"197970","199190"," So let's say he doesn't cut rates today."
"200010","206430"," He doesn't have that many decisions left this year, and he's already said that they likely wouldn't"
"206430","207230"," be back to back."
"207550","208970"," That's been known, right?"
"210250","217070"," So there's an inevitability to this in the market likes to front run these inevitabilities at some"
"217070","217430"," point. "
"218330","224230"," So that's a big thing for me today, at least is to listen to Jerome and what he has to"
"224230","225510"," what with the language is."
"225610","231430"," I think the language today is probably going to be the big thing."
"231990","233690"," Is there any change in language?"
"234490","238610"," We still got the data dependent and we're not quite ready to cut rates. "
"239770","246910"," So I think his verbiage today is going to matter significantly to how the market reacts in terms of"
"246910","247290"," price."
"248310","251610"," Now this morning on CNBC, not seeing too much this morning, right?"
"251870","254190"," Now, CNBC is pretty quiet overall."
"255670","258829"," Here's everything to expect from the Federal Reserve policy meeting. "
"259390","262970"," I'll open this one up for you and read it to you this morning."
"263810","266810"," We're not going to read it at the moment, but I will read it to you."
"268250","276230"," Fascinatingly, I read last night, I spent my time reading articles written for Main Street. "
"276590","283990"," That's what I did last night."
"284610","291210"," And maybe I'll try to read one of those articles to you this morning, how they explain things to"
"291210","292310"," regular people."
"293390","295930"," Next up, we've got financial juice this morning. "
"296370","297590"," Not too much here either."
"298330","301990"," Traders await FOMC guidance, European market wrap over here."
"308550","314450"," I thought this morning we'd at least have a pullback by open. "
"314550","317550"," Maybe we'll still get it this morning, but I was expecting it."
"317690","319670"," I didn't see it this morning."
"320910","327290"," So today, just so you know, today is the 20th and we've got the FOMC rate decision, right?"
"327410","330150"," We've got Fed Chair Powell press conference tomorrow. "
"330150","331430"," We do have some big news."
"331430","333910"," We've got initial claims at 8.30 in the morning."
"333930","341350"," We've got a PMI through into 9.45 a.m. and then on Friday, we have a Fed Chair Powell"
"341350","343590"," taking part on a Fed Listens event. "
"344190","352070"," Most of those Fed Listens events, they're usually tied to, I don't know, global warming or"
"352070","357290"," people's rights, all kinds of things that have nothing to do truly with the market."
"357290","363330"," Sometimes we get a comment or two, but I wouldn't expect too much out of the discussion on Friday"
"363330","365250"," on the 22nd."
"366910","370430"," Next time we're going to go to the opening phone this morning and see what position it be. "
"373290","378090"," On the top right hand side here, we have, just so you can see this here, you've got the previous"
"378090","380650"," high back here at 5."
"382070","390390"," 16, 5, 16, 73, the natural progression for an upside move is going to be to the zeros and fives."
"391090","396270"," So if you're looking for an upside target today on some good news from the Fed, you're likely going"
"396270","398250"," to be targeting, of course, 5.20, right?"
"398530","399230"," Nice and flat."
"400110","405250"," Right up here at this 5.20 is kind of your place that you're looking for today. "
"405790","412710"," The key point about today, too, when I get into with you is it being a Fed day, it's a"
"412710","414390"," good day not to trade."
"415170","421230"," I know you don't want to hear that, it's a lottery trade type of day, but I do want you"
"421230","425690"," to realize that trading the extremes has been fruitful."
"426490","429430"," Been fruitful this whole entire week was fruitful all of last week. "
"430270","439490"," And more specifically to today, you don't want to get caught before the rate decision or after the"
"439490","441050"," rate decision on the wrong side of a trade."
"441590","447130"," So you're looking for squeezes to sell and you're going to be looking for drops to buy."
"447830","449750"," Whatever you do, don't get caught in the middle of it. "
"450010","451690"," You've seen me here even do that, right?"
"452670","457950"," A lot of times on Fed rate days, I'm like, yeah, I'll go in right now at 1.45 in"
"457950","461750"," the afternoon and then the next 15 minutes, we're just dropping straight down into that decision,"
"462030","462070"," right?"
"462350","462610"," 2pm."
"463390","466390"," So try to trade the extremes here this morning."
"467350","468670"," So we've got 5.20 to the downside. "
"469150","472530"," We also know that we've got some other things to work with this morning."
"473190","475910"," We've got down below here at 5.10, 33."
"476470","478450"," So we'll snap a little line down there as well. "
"478990","480190"," Right down in here."
"482950","484510"," We'll make that nice and green."
"486990","488350"," So some tradable zones. "
"488710","490910"," You've got another one down below over here."
"491090","493110"," So you've got this little area right here."
"494930","496950"," See, we'll take that one right there. "
"498630","499910"," That's our hourly trigger."
"500830","504270"," And I think this looks like a foregone conclusion, doesn't it?"
"504270","510270"," It kind of looks like people have resigned and reserved themselves to an update."
"510610","511890"," I don't know how true that is. "
"512549","513169"," It could be."
"513250","514429"," Look at all this stuff down here."
"514510","516890"," You've got buyers, buyers, buyers. "
"518110","520429"," I don't know what you're going to do if you're a bear here this morning."
"521630","524790"," Right off the open this morning, let's take a peek and see what's going on."
"525350","529010"," This is where your head is right above all these yellow bars down here. "
"530850","532890"," And I'll switch over to the main screen."
"537470","538550"," Sorry about that."
"538610","539470"," I'm losing my voice already. "
"539670","540490"," We're not even there yet."
"541890","543990"," Next thing that we're going to do is I'm going to read some."
"544310","546350"," I'm going to read for you this morning. "
"547270","548350"," Slide this over."
"549370","551310"," I'm going to read for you this morning."
"553390","554570"," We'll come back to that. "
"555530","560150"," I'm going to read some briefs to you this morning from some other people so you can get other"
"560150","561970"," people's perspective on what to expect today."
"562350","567270"," It seems to be this thought process that we're going to 5.20 today, no matter what."
"567590","568970"," Now myself, I think we get a pullback. "
"569350","572070"," I think that we do pullback to at least the hourly trigger."
"572850","578070"," That's down here at 5.14.30. And I'll show it to you here."
"578990","583030"," You have a small, small bear cross above here in pre-market. "
"583870","588170"," So if I was looking for a dip to buy myself this morning, it's likely going to be down here."
"589870","591670"," Just like that right there."
"598090","599070"," Right down there. "
"601830","605390"," Yeah, Uncle JBJ is saying it'd be plenty of fails and nothing burger."
"605770","607630"," I can see that Uncle JBJ."
"608030","610410"," I mean, it's kind of a foregone conclusion, right?"
"611410","613370"," We're trading 5.16 right now. "
"614770","620550"," The market right now, at least the gamma market goes to 5.30. Let's take a look at the gamma"
"620550","621290"," market really quick."
"622330","625610"," I was wondering that same thing as a kind of a nothing burger, right?"
"625970","627530"," Kind of like crush all of the vol."
"627830","629810"," You crush bulls. "
"630550","634710"," Bulls wants to go to 5.50 or 5.30. And then you make the move later."
"635530","638850"," We'll take a look right now at SPX gamma this morning."
"638850","644970"," And let's see, let's see a look down below here and see what we can see in one quick second. "
"646850","648790"," I wanted the same thing, Uncle JBJ."
"648930","654510"," I'm like, man, this seems like a, this seems like a, uh, sell the news kind of an event, right?"
"654670","657830"," We're already, we traded up into, uh, the rate decision today."
"658770","661410"," And there's not a whole heck of a lot of room to the upside. "
"664930","666390"," Take a foregone conclusion."
"667330","672550"," Uh, do I take vitamins?"
"672990","673510"," Yeah, I take vitamins."
"674090","674650"," I take vitamins. "
"674830","677190"," I take vitamins and I take, um, I take vitamin E vitamin D."
"677790","678910"," And then I take a multi day."
"682670","684310"," Good morning to you too, folk."
"687130","688650"," I feel better today, though. "
"688750","691950"," I'm not feeling one feeling sick, but I don't feel the nausea."
"692470","693670"," I did speak to Binky yesterday."
"695030","697070"," And he said, hold on a second there. "
"701270","706050"," He did or we were thinking that I have nausea from the headphones being on."
"706530","711390"," So my heirs are being boxed out and because my heirs are boxed out with headphones."
"712450","715110"," That, uh, that's what's making me nauseous. "
"716810","719410"," We'll find out today if I get nauseous again this morning."
"719770","721690"," The plan here is to try to be."
"722390","724110"," Here we go right here. "
"727520","730020"," See if we can see anything from the market this morning."
"733830","736070"," Local resistance is a little bit higher this morning."
"736130","737090"," It's at 5200. "
"741070","743490"," Take a look down below and see what we got here."
"746610","748970"," So this is SPX gamma this morning."
"749110","750970"," We're slightly pushing. "
"752150","753470"," Turn that off for a minute."
"754210","756630"," So this is SPX gamma right now, right?"
"757230","759950"," You've got a local resistance now is at 5200."
"760770","764550"," So it's a little bit higher than it was yesterday was at 5180 yesterday. "
"765810","768830"," Market is now pricing in 5400."
"775030","779130"," So this wasn't here yesterday."
"779350","781270"," There's now a gamma bar above. "
"782950","784470"," At 5400."
"785130","786670"," This was not here yesterday."
"787330","788870"," This is new this morning. "
"789090","791790"," So there are there's call buying taking place."
"793710","795610"," To an extreme upside, right?"
"795730","797070"," You want to see that development."
"798290","800790"," Of a call walls to 5500. "
"802350","804130"," To get to 5300."
"805130","806870"," 54 or 5500."
"807110","809230"," Where you see that development to the upside above. "
"809590","812190"," Your target the better off you are as a bull."
"812650","816790"," And this morning we now have a new gamma bar above at 5400 Jesus."
"819590","820110"," Okay. "
"821150","822390"," It's 400 it is."
"823470","829110"," Also the gamma flip is you should note that the gamma flip this morning is at 5150."
"830010","831290"," It's pretty tight, right?"
"831430","833810"," We're coming straight up here with that with that gamma flip. "
"834510","842810"," Local support sits down below here at 5050 80 right down here."
"843610","844910"," Get rid of this one here."
"847350","848710"," This is your local support. "
"849970","854530"," And we are selling right now currently off of this 51 right here."
"854630","856850"," This 51 75 51 80."
"856990","860130"," So you can just see the rejection already happening this morning. "
"860130","861390"," You can know where the sellers are."
"861390","862390"," They're right above up here."
"862910","864590"," They're trying to sell us down right now. "
"864790","867530"," Remember to on these extremes we talked about."
"868030","870510"," Last week it was an important topic for us."
"870630","874790"," We said we'd get off the one minute chart and try to trade the extremes. "
"874790","877370"," And you can see right here in SPX right?"
"877810","883650"," Selling down, buying it up, selling it down, buying it up, selling it down, buying it up."
"883650","884590"," Selling it down, buying it up."
"885270","886850"," Of course we're right back to it again. "
"887370","889670"," These sellers want to sell us down today, right?"
"890490","893530"," It's only natural if they would want to do something like this."
"893650","896390"," So just be aware of it as the morning progresses."
"903870","906430"," We're seeing it right now off of the open right. "
"906710","908210"," You can see where I drew this line here."
"908270","909710"," They're trying to sell this thing down."
"910170","911850"," Get us down into the half hour trade. "
"912010","914170"," The half hour trade is at 5, 15, 10."
"914550","917530"," And the hourly trigger is down below at 5, 14, 30."
"919210","921030"," And if you guys want to know for me what I think. "
"923430","924490"," It's a hard one."
"924770","926090"," It really is this morning."
"926090","929210"," If we were lower, if we sold down into this event. "
"932250","934450"," I'd be like, the sky is the ceiling."
"934930","935750"," Where we are right now?"
"936930","938990"," Trade in 5, 5, 15, right?"
"939710","941130"," What's the expectation here today?"
"941390","943190"," Do you think we trade higher than 5, 20?"
"943830","946390"," Would you like to see a pullback to trade 5, 20?"
"947690","949190"," This seems like a sell the news event."
"949410","951110"," I'm telling you, this seems sketchy to me. "
"951170","951550"," I could be wrong."
"951870","953010"," Maybe I just don't like being a bull."
"958590","959210"," Yeah, yeah. "
"959310","960490"," That's, that's what I was thinking."
"960610","963410"," The same thing like 5, 5, 20, man."
"963670","965450"," Can we go higher than 5, 20 today?"
"966390","967430"," I'm not quite sure. "
"967710","970550"," We might be able to take a look at IWM this morning and see what they're doing."
"971690","975110"," And look at it's parked right on IWM this morning in the half hour, right?"
"975590","979050"," It's parked right on the daily trigger at 201, 68."
"979870","982430"," If there was this, if there was a ticker today that could move. "
"983670","985290"," It's probably small caps."
"985290","989530"," Probably small caps can move either up or down depending on what the decision is today."
"989870","992750"," And my big question, you want doom into the close by?"
"994210","998350"," You want doom into the close by. "
"998750","1001190"," IWM is probably the ticker for you today."
"1001670","1005030"," If you're looking for an upside move at least or the chance of an upside move."
"1005510","1013750"," My biggest contention or question about IWM is if we get rate cuts, small caps does very well with"
"1013750","1014170"," rate cuts. "
"1014170","1020430"," They do horrible when a rate increase all seasons from the Fed."
"1020970","1022730"," And so when do they start to ramp that?"
"1022930","1024230"," Look where it's parked right now."
"1024290","1026869"," It's like parked perfectly on it's daily trigger. "
"1027310","1029089"," Insert doom into me digitally."
"1033670","1037210"," Give me a 6 billion MOC sell side limit down."
"1038190","1041670"," You remember if it's 4, what does trader podcast say?"
"1041670","1047810"," If it's a $1 to $4 billion expect market to move up right by calls on that close. "
"1049710","1050970"," Oh, it's killing me."
"1051630","1055250"," Alright, so IWM is going to be the one that I'm going to watch this morning."
"1055810","1058860"," I don't know if the original, let's say we don't get a rate cuts. "
"1059850","1060690"," We don't get a rate increase."
"1060770","1064730"," We just go data dependent on the bullshit that Jerome says."
"1065330","1070730"," I'm interested to see if there's any blood here on IWM this morning or if they begin the pricing"
"1070730","1071170"," in. "
"1071790","1076330"," During the Q&A they do the pricing in of small caps."
"1077190","1079170"," What he says today is going to matter."
"1080450","1083570"," We look at a rate cut coming up. "
"1083730","1088510"," Is he going to leak any of that that we're waiting for a rate or we're now waiting for the"
"1088510","1091050"," next rate cut at the next rate decision meeting?"
"1091750","1095630"," How does IWM and small caps respond to that today?"
"1098030","1102010"," This has to be the most relentlessly bullish market of all time."
"1103950","1105210"," You guys want to see something cool?"
"1105990","1106770"," Let's say it's something cool."
"1107210","1108370"," I got something really cool for you. "
"1109190","1110250"," Give me a second here."
"1111210","1112490"," I got something neat for you."
"1114250","1122410"," The one thing that is it, it could be, I was looking at, I'll show you what I was looking"
"1122410","1122710"," at. "
"1123230","1124410"," The thing that's got me."
"1124410","1128890"," I was looking at 1987, right?"
"1129710","1135610"," Then I was looking at the run from 1995 to 1999."
"1137350","1141850"," I apologize, I'm still pretty sick, so I apologize for my voice. "
"1143250","1145530"," I'll show you guys something neat here."
"1150620","1155580"," The thing that's got me here, let's see if we can show you something here."
"1162420","1164440"," I always like looking at this chart. "
"1164640","1170960"," This is the S&P 500 PE ratio, Ford PE ratio."
"1172120","1178160"," What I find fascinating about it is, if you go back to 1978, I should think, somewhere in here."
"1179380","1181060"," It's like 1978 right here. "
"1182340","1185040"," I should draw this line a little bit farther down."
"1185160","1185720"," This is 74."
"1186700","1195600"," We had material changes to our markets once in the 50s and 60s, but more importantly as Reagan"
"1195600","1196520"," became president. "
"1197400","1204300"," Whenever I see these guys out there in CNBC, especially the old guys, I always like to hear what"
"1204300","1207800"," they have to say when the PE ratios get down here."
"1209600","1211540"," Let's see what they're saying on CNBC."
"1211540","1218220"," It's always fascinating because these guys have been buying this dip down here for decades, right?"
"1218480","1219860"," They seem down here buying it right now. "
"1219920","1220820"," They're buying it right here."
"1221600","1222900"," They did it again."
"1224380","1227540"," I remember I posted this chart right here. "
"1228100","1229480"," That was the low right there."
"1229740","1230960"," This is the low right here, right?"
"1230960","1241020"," I remember I posted this chart as these guys were coming on CNBC and they were talking about how, I"
"1241020","1249160"," think it was the guy that was on CNBC or whatever, but the thing that mattered was these guys are"
"1249160","1253500"," like, you know, don't buy the dip, don't buy the dip, don't buy the dip, and these are the guys"
"1253500","1254620"," that are actually buying the dip."
"1254620","1258280"," This isn't you and I, this is big money, right?"
"1258800","1262960"," All these talking heads telling you not to buy the dip, and yet they've been doing it like that"
"1262960","1263620"," since 1978. "
"1265180","1270080"," One of the most fascinating parts about where we are currently, see this gray line right here?"
"1270760","1272600"," Not the green line, but the gray line that's above."
"1276180","1284600"," You can see right where we are right now, right?"
"1284600","1290500"," And you've got now 89 into 1985, right?"
"1291100","1293180"," We're now surpassing that one, right?"
"1293600","1293980"," See that?"
"1294200","1294680"," It's like 87."
"1295480","1301120"," And then this is the 89 to 95 run, and we're now surpassing to this run right here. "
"1301920","1309320"," And this run right here, what I find most fascinating about this run is that you've got 1995 right"
"1309320","1310300"," here, right?"
"1310300","1315180"," And this is the year, this is about the year 2000 right here, you see it?"
"1317160","1326800"," And we're making, we're, we're like putting on right now in time, years of growth in a"
"1326800","1332740"," quarter, more than the core year, a year and one quarter, but I want you to see that right now"
"1332740","1337940"," that you're talking about what took years to do."
"1339860","1343740"," We're doing it at a pace that is kind of unseen."
"1344040","1348000"," I forget, I don't see, I remember who said that in the chat just now, but look at this right"
"1348000","1350200"," here, big pull up, pull back. "
"1351080","1355160"," And then there's just this monster move to the top."
"1356000","1357360"," You can kind of see right now, right?"
"1357500","1362480"," We're past all that, past all this, and now we're making this run in"
"1362480","1367820"," what?"
"1367820","1368720"," Top in the year 2000."
"1369860","1371260"," That's the tech bubble, right?"
"1371520","1376900"," The tech bubble, just this right here is what we're now training, believe it or not. "
"1377700","1384300"," And to that, so to that question, what we are, what we're in right now, let's take a look at"
"1384300","1384800"," it here, right?"
"1385540","1391020"," You can see right now that we've got this big push right here, big push right here, and the"
"1391020","1396980"," question becomes do we go up here and trade that 1995 to 2000."
"1397820","1399540"," In just one year."
"1399880","1407160"," You're talking about crazy, crazy moves in the market, right?"
"1407640","1408300"," Tell me that's not insane. "
"1408820","1417220"," I just showed it to you, like, and I've seen people on Fintuit say things like we're just getting"
"1417220","1421540"," started or you might see another four or five years of this."
"1422080","1423740"," And I'm like, no, no, no, no."
"1423900","1432280"," You're seeing four or five years of growth in a year and a half, like four times the rate of"
"1432280","1434780"," growth that we had in the year 2000. "
"1435460","1438220"," That's how crazy this move is."
"1438840","1441000"," Was that you stocks anonymous that said that?"
"1441480","1443660"," Like, this might be the strongest bull run ever."
"1444000","1444980"," This might be, man. "
"1448660","1449840"," It's insane, dude."
"1449840","1450920"," It's pure insanity."
"1451060","1452160"," I'm looking at it right now. "
"1452240","1454400"," I woke up this morning and I'm like, what do I even do to this?"
"1454800","1458540"," Like, can we get a pullback this morning to trade?"
"1458940","1463500"," How do you trade a high of five, 16, 20 on a rate decision day?"
"1463940","1465060"," I don't know how you do that."
"1466560","1467640"," We're bullish as heck."
"1468040","1471940"," I don't know. "
"1472820","1474100"," This looks to me."
"1474100","1479140"," If you're going to ask me what I think happens this year, I wrote a, I wrote an expectation for"
"1479140","1480080"," this year in December."
"1481060","1482420"," It looks like a blow off top. "
"1483460","1484420"," That's what it looks like."
"1485100","1489120"," It looks like a mad dash to the end."
"1490280","1491800"," And that's what it really looks like to me. "
"1492920","1498880"," If we go up and up and up into December or March with the election, we get the election effect"
"1498880","1500900"," that carries us into March."
"1500900","1504140"," Where do you think will be if that happens?"
"1504580","1508180"," I don't think 6,000 is out of control."
"1508500","1515880"," I don't think it's on it to not be expected that we can trade that 6,000 with where we"
"1515880","1518980"," are going and the speed at which we're going to it. "
"1519380","1526920"," The one thing that bothers me here that I put inside that expectation for the year is that if we"
"1526920","1529140"," do this, we do this like mad dash."
"1529960","1532280"," Into end of year and into March."
"1533260","1541120"," That that is the end of a debt cycle that the housing cycle runs in 18 years, around 18 years. "
"1542380","1546560"," And right in that 2026, excuse me, 2025."
"1547600","1549940"," Right around there, we're at about that 18 year mark."
"1552560","1554020"," It looks like to me. "
"1554760","1557440"," Nothing at this point is saying otherwise."
"1558420","1560660"," That would be a major market top."
"1561460","1566760"," So if we came into January, March of 2025, you're talking about what?"
"1567340","1568940"," Two or three down years. "
"1570140","1575600"," Two or three down years and then possibly four to six years of sideways."
"1577180","1581720"," So take that into consideration with this bull run."
"1582100","1584400"," This bull run as it looks right now. "
"1585400","1589900"," Looks like a blow off top and it looks like the housing cycle."
"1590460","1593560"," You count the years from 2007 to 2008 to right now."
"1594160","1595560"," And you're right at that 18 year mark. "
"1595820","1600700"," If that is the case, this is it for a bull."
"1600840","1601420"," This is your run."
"1602080","1603420"," You're going to get your blow off top. "
"1603660","1605740"," You're likely going to come in to the market some mornings."
"1606940","1607880"," What are you going to see?"
"1608840","1610740"," Stocks up five percent in a day."
"1611520","1612680"," Three percent in a day. "
"1613620","1614880"," Something in pure insanity."
"1615460","1617560"," I can't even believe that we're talking about this because."
"1619540","1620480"," I don't know. "
"1620500","1622440"," I don't know that I want to know that reality either."
"1622880","1624740"," Like waking up and you're like up five percent."
"1627660","1634280"," 10 percent every day relentlessly relentlessly over and over and over as you make that run to the"
"1634280","1635160"," to the tippity top. "
"1636020","1638320"," Any guys old enough to be where you guys here?"
"1638600","1644200"," Do you guys remember the news programming that was going on in 2000 during that tech bubble?"
"1644420","1644900"," It was insane."
"1645540","1646200"," It was pure insanity."
"1649630","1652690"," Yeah, John saying they won't let it dump until after the election. "
"1656430","1658530"," The worst part about this too."
"1658750","1659410"," I was thinking of this."
"1659630","1661530"," I'm like, if we get the blow off top, right?"
"1662930","1663790"," And you're young. "
"1665310","1666510"," You got no buy."
"1667330","1671550"," Like you got no if that's the case, you get no buy for a couple of years, two or three"
"1671550","1671770"," years."
"1672350","1673850"," You would have no buy in this market. "
"1674630","1681590"," You'd be selling this market and then you'd be seeing a market that turns over or consolidates for"
"1681590","1682670"," multiple years."
"1682670","1685110"," Now, is that good for you if you're young?"
"1685830","1687210"," Overall 20 years?"
"1687430","1687550"," Yes."
"1687950","1689490"," You'll get a generational buying opportunity. "
"1690730","1691590"," Out of it."
"1691870","1694470"," But you know, you're still talking about waiting."
"1696230","1699670"," Four years, four years, five years, something like that, maybe. "
"1701210","1706850"," Twenty twenty twenty twenty thirty twenty eight twenty thirty somewhere in there."
"1707590","1709710"," For that generational buy for yourself."
"1710630","1712450"," Let me ask you guys that you guys. "
"1712890","1717690"," Do any of you guys think that this is not the case?"
"1718310","1722610"," Do you have a counter argument to this argument that this is a blow off top?"
"1723310","1728930"," Do you think that the bull run will extend beyond springtime 2025 March 2025?"
"1728930","1730970"," Do you think that will have continuation?"
"1734370","1736810"," If you are young, it's the worst scenario."
"1736970","1740330"," My whole generation is going to miss the normal returns due to this past few years."
"1740590","1741330"," I think so. "
"1742270","1743330"," I think you are."
"1743550","1744330"," I think you're going to miss."
"1744830","1746230"," I think you're going to be waiting about a decade. "
"1746590","1747310"," They're not a decade."
"1747430","1747570"," We're in."
"1747870","1749110"," We're in twenty twenty four. "
"1749230","1750590"," So you got another five years."
"1753330","1757610"," Or you could just DCA the whole time leading up to the next range to be established."
"1757970","1760370"," I don't know if you look back on. "
"1760370","1767990"," If you look back on 2000, look back on 2008, 2000, those bottoms, they weren't DCA events."
"1768390","1770610"," They were sitting in your hand events."
"1771230","1771710"," They weren't. "
"1771790","1771970"," They were."
"1772950","1775390"," They wash out so many companies."
"1775870","1776470"," They wash out. "
"1776650","1778370"," It's a complete wash of the market."
"1780790","1782330"," You don't think this is the bluff top."
"1782450","1783450"," I think you think it's fair valuation. "
"1784530","1787310"," Did you just see the fair valuation chart that I brought up?"
"1787310","1791130"," Did you see the S&P 500 forward PE ratio?"
"1793490","1794130"," Let's see."
"1794270","1797730"," It seems like we've been trading that for since 1978."
"1801310","1804810"," 2000 was dead money until a year or two before the GFC. "
"1811650","1812910"," Yeah, I'm wondering."
"1813370","1815310"," I'm looking at the fair value right now."
"1817130","1818710"," We're definitely above fair value. "
"1819210","1819810"," Without a doubt."
"1819950","1821550"," We're trading 1995 right now."
"1821750","1822150"," Factually. "
"1822870","1825890"," We're trading the 1995 to 2000 run."
"1827310","1828170"," Oh, you missed it?"
"1828570","1829350"," You want to show it to you again?"
"1829430","1830050"," I'll show it to you right now."
"1830490","1830930"," Hold on. "
"1831730","1832830"," We'll go over one more time."
"1833430","1834870"," First, let me post this on."
"1835250","1840270"," You post this on FinTwit so that if anyone wants to come watch the show, they can hop in. "
"1840430","1844230"," By the way, if you're on YouTube this morning, I left the comments open for you."
"1844690","1847930"," So you can chat this morning if you want to because it is FedDay."
"1855780","1857460"," Give me one quick second here. "
"1858940","1860400"," QQQ's and IWM."
"1862960","1866860"," I always forget to put the live stream up on Twitter."
"1876310","1877790"," Yeah, we'll go over this one more time. "
"1877970","1879430"," We'll let me go through it one more time."
"1879430","1887780"," I mean, just one quick second here."
"1904810","1908830"," So some of it a comment that no, this is not a blow off top. "
"1910850","1913990"," And they said get share of link."
"1922290","1923070"," Here we go."
"1932220","1934260"," Hey, Zach, thanks for saying the appreciate me. "
"1936840","1937700"," Did I watch."
"1938800","1940580"," Yeah, it's announcement video."
"1940820","1942580"," No, I don't know anything about what's going on. "
"1942580","1945340"," I haven't seen Mr. Yen in some time."
"1945780","1946740"," Well, what was the announcement?"
"1947620","1949620"," Was it good bad or is he okay?"
"1949780","1950100"," Is this health?"
"1950260","1950480"," Okay."
"1950740","1955500"," I hope he's all right, by the way. "
"1957180","1958520"," No, haven't seen Mr. Yen."
"1958740","1959780"," Don't know what's going on with him."
"1960880","1964780"," Okay, so we're going to go and someone brought up earlier fair evaluation. "
"1965880","1968600"," And I know some of you were here for it, but some of you were not."
"1971100","1972160"," One second here."
"1973540","1974960"," Oh, was it pure fury?"
"1974960","1976060"," That sucks. "
"1979140","1980080"," Hope he's okay."
"1980640","1981380"," I haven't seen it."
"1981900","1986640"," Hey, Mr. Talking Monkey, would you post it to me to my or send me an email with it or"
"1986640","1989100"," something or a DM on Discord so I can read it. "
"1990580","1991380"," And that sucks."
"1993900","1995920"," Yeah, let's look at."
"1996000","1997180"," Let's look at this really quick. "
"1997180","1997400"," Ready?"
"1998840","1999960"," How am I feeling sick?"
"2001380","2001840"," Totally."
"2002260","2003160"," You can hear it."
"2003280","2005420"," It's all inside my nose and up inside of my top. "
"2007640","2009820"," All right, so we're going to take a look at the PE ratio."
"2009820","2011940"," We're showing this to you earlier this morning."
"2012820","2018640"," I post this chart every time we get down here. "
"2019460","2020880"," Right where the screen line is, right?"
"2021160","2027460"," Whenever the PE ratio is down here, I try to post this chart on Fintuit when we're down here."
"2027460","2030720"," The reason being is I'll hear these guys."
"2030860","2036120"," These old guys have come on to Fintuit or not Fintuit to CMBC and they'll say things like, don't"
"2036120","2040400"," buy the dip, blah, blah, blah, my bonds, this, my bonds, that. "
"2040960","2044800"," And in reality, this is where they're buying the dip by the dip down here."
"2045760","2047199"," And they did it again down here."
"2047460","2048060"," This was October. "
"2049120","2051520"," They've been doing this shit since 1978."
"2052560","2056120"," We had material changes to our stock market back here too."
"2056120","2062880"," You had banks that began to get more aggressive in their investments in the stock market. "
"2063120","2068880"," We also had Reagan come to power in here and you can see a material change where they bought the"
"2068880","2069080"," dip."
"2069260","2073659"," You can actually see it rising slowly over time to where they bought the dip."
"2074400","2078280"," Now this was back in this right here, right down in here. "
"2078380","2079300"," This was back in October."
"2080100","2082460"," They were actually buying the dip to be truthful with you."
"2082460","2087460"," They were actually buying the dip back here in June of 2022. "
"2088920","2092860"," And then they bought the dip again back here in September 30th."
"2093020","2094620"," They were buying the dip again."
"2095139","2098320"," They didn't stop buying the dip at all. "
"2100700","2102820"," So they didn't stop buying the dip."
"2103000","2103560"," They came in last."
"2103740","2105520"," They came in 2022 and they kept buying the dip. "
"2105740","2107940"," Now the point behind this chart is this."
"2107940","2112740"," What's important about this chart right now is this white line that you see here."
"2112920","2113920"," See this white line right here. "
"2114880","2115800"," That white line."
"2115940","2116620"," This one right here."
"2116680","2117700"," It's going right across right there. "
"2119440","2123720"," That is where we currently are in the Ford PE ratio for the S&P 500."
"2124940","2126420"," And we have now surpassed."
"2128360","2133680"," We have now surpassed 84 to 89. "
"2134440","2136660"," So this is the 87 crash right here."
"2138040","2141420"," And we've also surpassed the early 90s."
"2142520","2142860"," Right here. "
"2143980","2146460"," And what are we trading right now is the question."
"2146760","2150820"," We are trading right now the run from 1995."
"2153000","2156460"," Up into June of 1999. "
"2158420","2160460"," That's where we're trading right now."
"2160460","2164820"," You can actually see this here pull back and then push higher."
"2165120","2166200"," And that's what we're discussing right. "
"2167000","2168960"," Are we going to go higher in the market?"
"2170100","2172200"," And if we are going to go higher in the market."
"2173480","2175100"," What years are we trading?"
"2175600","2179180"," And the other fascinating part here is look at the time frame."
"2180260","2182920"," You know if this is my May of 95 right. "
"2183100","2185240"," This would be October 2022."
"2185660","2187560"," And now we're trying to trade."
"2188420","2192160"," Four years in about a year and a half, two years, but half the time. "
"2192920","2194860"," To get to this next top."
"2195720","2197660"," This is the tech run right here."
"2198440","2199840"," And this is the rest of it, right?"
"2200020","2200720"," We got this. "
"2200860","2202060"," This other poll right here."
"2202160","2202460"," This is."
"2204240","2206760"," Friday the 1st of February of 2002. "
"2208240","2211940"," So if you think about where we are right now when you're making an argument."
"2212580","2213660"," Hey, where are we?"
"2213860","2214360"," Where are we going?"
"2214360","2218780"," And this is, of course, the COVID run up here, right?"
"2219360","2225540"," It's pretty still pretty low in terms of the COVID run, but 95 2000 is where we're headed."
"2227860","2229440"," So we're doing it fast. "
"2229960","2234720"," The rates and the clip that we're doing it is pure incentive."
"2236220","2240520"," So I'm being asked by people like I'm asking people do we have a blow off top that we're coming"
"2240520","2240800"," into?"
"2240800","2242980"," So we're trading a blow off top for."
"2243660","2247840"," We're trading a blow off top for December, March. "
"2248740","2255120"," Well, the P.E. ratios rise so dramatically that you're going to get four years of growth."
"2256100","2259240"," Five years of growth in about a year and a half, right?"
"2259640","2260060"," Maybe two years."
"2261560","2263700"," Just like rip facing fast. "
"2265620","2267440"," Just rip, rip facing fast."
"2270560","2275200"," When people say fair value, I'm like, yeah, I'm with fair value, but, you know, this run here has"
"2275200","2278000"," been, you know, it's been vertical the entire way, right?"
"2284300","2285580"," Now, you guys can do this at home."
"2285760","2287180"," You don't need me to do this for you. "
"2287380","2288920"," If you get here, hold on a second here."
"2290800","2292560"," Here, I got some, I got some cool for you guys."
"2292560","2293800"," Think that one second. "
"2301320","2303140"," Hang tight here one second."
"2305700","2309240"," I will post the, I will post this for you."
"2310160","2311520"," Let me one quick second here. "
"2315050","2319510"," If you have a trading view at home, see, can I post this here?"
"2322890","2324150"," So Eugene Park."
"2326630","2328490"," I want you to plug that."
"2329830","2333090"," I want you to plug this into trading view at home. "
"2334110","2341410"," And, uh, we put this on a, we're an S&P 500 B, B to be back at that green"
"2341410","2342510"," line, 3500."
"2343790","2347430"," Yeah, 3500, well, let's talk about where that green line would be now."
"2347430","2350070"," No, it would not be at 3500 today. "
"2350450","2356230"," That green line heads higher, creeping slowly over time, going back to 1978."
"2356710","2360890"," We're talking about 3800, 3900 somewhere in there."
"2361530","2365470"," If we came back to that green line somewhere, somewhere roughly around there. "
"2366110","2370090"," And to be honest, whenever we get down there, I don't really care where price is."
"2370370","2372090"," I care about the ratio, right?"
"2372930","2378250"," So as long as we're down there, I start paying attention to the talking heads."
"2378330","2383490"," And I start listening to the bears that are out there and they're like, oh, we're going to crash"
"2383490","2384170"," even deeper. "
"2384390","2386850"," And I'm like, no, dude, they've been, they've been running this shit."
"2386890","2387910"," This is even through the GFC."
"2388330","2389330"," They bought the shit down. "
"2389470","2390690"," They bought the hell out of it down there."
"2391590","2394290"," It's just like a slow creeping line that keeps going up."
"2394290","2397590"," So roughly 3800, 3900 somewhere in there. "
"2400850","2404350"," I'll post this for the Twitch gang too."
"2408370","2409710"," It constantly goes up."
"2409950","2412150"," It's like it's like a slow riding line. "
"2412610","2414030"," They've been buying the dip like that."
"2414150","2418150"," This is how, this is how like, how do I explain this?"
"2419130","2421030"," Like everybody, everybody makes things complicated."
"2421990","2423610"," They're always like complicating stuff. "
"2424890","2429230"," And I'm like, well, wait a minute, you can actually look back and see exactly where they are buying"
"2429230","2429570"," the dip."
"2429570","2431130"," You can, you can see exactly where they do it."
"2431630","2433650"," You can see that there's this trend line. "
"2433770","2438450"," There's like some, there's some guy at an office somewhere and they don't over complicate this"
"2438450","2438670"," shit."
"2438850","2441950"," They're like, oh, the PE ratio is down at 14 right now."
"2442410","2444550"," Start buying like clockwork. "
"2444790","2447370"," Been doing it since 1978."
"2448150","2451650"," So when you hear these guys on CNBC talking, they're fucking lying to you."
"2452090","2453050"," They're lying all day long. "
"2453310","2454790"," And there's nothing complicated to this."
"2455330","2456910"," They just do it repetitively."
"2457070","2462450"," Over and over and over and over and over and over and over without fail. "
"2473530","2475430"," Let's just park, let's just park up here."
"2475650","2477490"," Not moving at all right now."
"2478170","2479770"," I don't even know if we're going to get the dip buy. "
"2480750","2483710"," It just looks like this looks like it just wants to go up, baby."
"2485650","2487510"," Just wants to go up."
"2492340","2494320"," Where's the 520 target up here?"
"2494320","2498300"," Oh, yeah, there it is right there. "
"2498520","2501380"," Valhalla right there."
"2508740","2509740"," Let's draw that."
"2509800","2510540"," Let's draw that in. "
"2511540","2512980"," Let's draw Valhalla."
"2526320","2529080"," I got 52231 up here."
"2531160","2533100"," Our three, 52231. "
"2533100","2541100"," Our four and our five, 52546, 52861."
"2545860","2550400"," Does anybody have a 528 on their bingo card today?"
"2551240","2552180"," Anybody at all?"
"2553720","2556320"," We're talking about just R2 today."
"2557140","2558540"," Just give me R2. "
"2560220","2562640"," Anybody have 528 on their bingo card?"
"2562960","2563980"," I don't."
"2567120","2571620"," I don't have 528 on my bingo card today."
"2572180","2572860"," You're ready?"
"2575380","2577460"," My God, savages. "
"2579260","2580680"," Pure savages."
"2580720","2583380"," R1, 517, 43."
"2585900","2588660"," R2, 519, 15. "
"2591360","2594180"," My God, you guys are buying calls, huh?"
"2596780","2599440"," You guys are buying crazy calls."
"2601560","2605500"," I'm going to read some morning briefs for you on what to expect today."
"2608100","2614900"," Here, we're going to be one quick second here. "
"2621720","2622760"," Huh, interesting."
"2626490","2630550"," We should talk about NVDA and their growth this morning."
"2631750","2632390"," Growth expectations. "
"2642030","2646670"," We'll be one quick second here."
"2654080","2660300"," S&P 500 rallied 0.6% yesterday to a new record high supported by a broad number of components."
"2661020","2668100"," Equal, wicked, weighted basket of 0.6%. Short-term interest rate futures are pricing in only about"
"2668100","2672840"," 2.5 rate cuts for 2024 ahead of the Fed's interest rate decision. "
"2674240","2678200"," So the bar for a hawkish surprise is pretty low in our opinion."
"2679880","2686260"," From a gamma perspective, upside potential is clearly there as the overall SPX dealer imbalances"
"2686260","2692300"," running at only $426 million, which is not indicative of an overbought market from an option"
"2692300","2692800"," perspective."
"2693980","2695200"," So we can go higher. "
"2696420","2701240"," The relative modest call wall at 5200 is the key strike to watch today."
"2702480","2705000"," We expect the market would quickly trade higher."
"2706240","2713520"," Quickly trade higher to 5300 when resistance falls. "
"2714220","2715420"," We post that on Twitter."
"2719200","2720700"," Key point for today."
"2728010","2735050"," If we break above 5200, I can't believe I'm posting this. "
"2735190","2736210"," I'm going to eat these words."
"2738370","2756660"," So I"
"2756660","2757640"," just posted on Twitter."
"2758980","2760600"," Key point for today. "
"2760720","2765120"," If we break above 5200, 5300 will be fast."
"2771660","2775600"," And we can see it here already this morning."
"2776140","2782500"," We've got 517.43. We've got the Valhalla target of 520. "
"2784720","2788040"," And then we have the RTX cell zone above."
"2797440","2799140"," Let's go over and check that out."
"2801580","2809310"," I don't think we're going here. "
"2809410","2810350"," There's no way we're going here."
"2810510","2812130"," We're going to change this Valhalla to a yellow."
"2812850","2813630"," Just in case. "
"2815910","2818250"," I don't think anybody's got this on there."
"2818430","2819530"," I don't think anybody has this."
"2819730","2825790"," If there's anybody out there that you know of have 528 as a possible target. "
"2826790","2829470"," If not today in next week or so."
"2829930","2834490"," Does anybody out there have 530 as a potential target?"
"2835590","2837810"," I'll be the first to tell it to you if you don't."
"2838950","2840490"," If 520 falls. "
"2841250","2843810"," We will target 528 61."
"2845150","2846390"," I can't believe we would say in this."
"2847610","2851790"," 525 46 and 528 61. "
"2852170","2853110"," It's going to a 30 minute chart."
"2853290","2853870"," Take a peek at it."
"2859250","2860910"," Look at that right there. "
"2863510","2865930"," Does anybody ready for that big green bar?"
"2866770","2869450"," Like burritos right straight up."
"2869450","2870050"," Look at that."
"2872250","2873810"," That looks impossible to me. "
"2873930","2874770"," I got to be honest with you."
"2874970","2876090"," That doesn't look right to me."
"2878810","2879590"," I'm a bull. "
"2885810","2888470"," That right there."
"2891270","2891710"," 530."
"2894130","2896290"," Like, yeah, like one big giant green. "
"2899490","2902710"," Do I really think JPM will let it get there before and a quarter?"
"2902710","2903430"," It's a good question."
"2903970","2908550"," There is no magnet right now drawing us into the collar."
"2909950","2913470"," So no, and they're making money regardless. "
"2913950","2915650"," If we pop this, well, we pop the collar, right?"
"2915830","2920490"," But there's nothing like there's nothing dragging us down into end of quarter."
"2920730","2923890"," So no, I don't think there's anything that would stop us."
"2924050","2928310"," And the one thing that's freaking me out this morning was when I just put the game on the chart"
"2928310","2930390"," and I'm like, oh, we got 5400 now. "
"2931390","2933210"," 5400 allows you to go to 5300."
"2933890","2937230"," Whether you like that or not, now we have room now to go there."
"2937450","2939830"," So is it possible?"
"2940990","2941750"," Theoretically, yes. "
"2942590","2943870"," There is a potential."
"2944330","2946210"," What is the probability of us going there today?"
"2948930","2950090"," 25% chance."
"2951750","2952810"," 25% chance. "
"2954290","2955330"," David, how are you, man?"
"2955590","2955870"," Good morning."
"2955970","2956290"," How are you, brother?"
"2958430","2960230"," 25% chance we can go there today."
"2960450","2962830"," It's not a big percentage chance, but there is a chance. "
"2967600","2972180"," You have 512 as slightly higher gamut than 5120."
"2972700","2973780"," So I say 512."
"2974720","2976040"," I'm trying to buy a dip down here. "
"2976100","2981500"," If I can buy this down here, right down here, these screen bars, anything down in this zone right"
"2981500","2982920"," here, I'll take it."
"2982960","2985860"," Whether it's down here, I don't care if it's there, there, there."
"2986920","2991700"," If we get a little bit of volatility into the rate decision, we blast down here, and then that's"
"2991700","2992480"," the move up higher. "
"2993300","2994080"," I'll take that."
"2994100","2995600"," I'll take that dip by all day long."
"2995760","2996760"," I think that's where you are, right?"
"2996860","2998340"," I've got it at 51250. "
"2999920","3002520"," I've got a 51255."
"3004980","3006420"," I'd like to buy that dip if possible."
"3013760","3016400"," 528C is $0.05 worth of Lotto, maybe. "
"3017140","3021460"," I wouldn't be buying any Lottos here for a month until we get the..."
"3021460","3022840"," Personally, myself."
"3023520","3024480"," I'll wait for..."
"3024480","3027780"," I think we're still going to roll down a little bit here."
"3030300","3037180"," Chase Winters saying, spot gammas wrong so far in Vixpiration, and they drop it lower and lower. "
"3037180","3037800"," What are they saying?"
"3037940","3039840"," What is spot gammas saying out there, Chase?"
"3048190","3049850"," I don't follow them anymore."
"3050290","3052490"," I have no opinion of them anymore either."
"3052850","3054150"," I don't know what they're saying. "
"3057410","3059010"," Morgan, how are you doing out there, short seller?"
"3059310","3059690"," Good morning, brother."
"3060010","3061670"," Did you have a chance to see the..."
"3062070","3066710"," I put up a PE ratio chart for you to take a look at or consider."
"3066710","3074890"," I did post in the chat what to plug into trading view to see that PE ratio, and you want"
"3074890","3077110"," to be viewing it on a daily or weekly basis. "
"3082540","3084000"," Yeah, I don't know what those guys..."
"3084000","3085500"," Thanks for reposting that right now."
"3085700","3086300"," I appreciate that."
"3089200","3091820"," Now, $5.30's spied, not until April. "
"3093160","3094440"," So, just a heads up."
"3094740","3101920"," If you're just joining us, I don't think we're going to $5.30. Right now, but I do want you"
"3101920","3102540"," to be aware."
"3103560","3105040"," I want you to be aware. "
"3109660","3119220"," The gamma profile for the market this morning has opened up to $5.40. The wall at $5,200 is"
"3119220","3119840"," now weak."
"3121440","3121740"," It's weak."
"3122560","3128620"," It can be broken through, and we can quickly trade $5,300. "
"3129980","3132220"," You need to be aware of that, even if we're not going to do it today."
"3132900","3138040"," I want you to be aware that the window is open to trade that."
"3140140","3141480"," Please be aware of that today. "
"3142300","3144680"," I need you to be aware of it, even if you don't agree with it."
"3145340","3146160"," Just be aware of it."
"3146520","3151720"," If you're short, you need to be aware..."
"3151720","3153360"," There's a potential for us to trade that today. "
"3154780","3157280"," $5.28 is a possibility."
"3158560","3159460"," It's not expected."
"3160380","3164480"," As a matter of fact, that target of $5.28 would be a two-signal move. "
"3165160","3166920"," That only happens 10% of the time."
"3167280","3170880"," I just want you to know that the conditions are right for us to trade it."
"3171640","3173040"," I'm going to eat these words. "
"3173260","3173700"," I already know it."
"3173880","3174620"," We're not going to trade it."
"3174800","3176240"," I can't call it $5,300. "

"3179080","3180920"," I just need you to understand that it's there."
"3184540","3186180"," There is a chance we can trade it. "
"3188860","3189740"," It's a total gamble."
"3190000","3190560"," I'll say that."
"3190720","3191020"," It's a gamble. "
"3191600","3193720"," But $5,200, that wall is open."
"3194020","3194740"," It was not open."
"3194940","3195660"," It is now open. "
"3196920","3199180"," That is not a resistance anymore."
"3199800","3202300"," $5,200 is nothing for us to trade."
"3203160","3204100"," Please be aware of that. "
"3204100","3209650"," That was as of this morning."
"3210090","3211990"," This is very new information."
"3212390","3214010"," We had it as half an hour ago. "
"3222980","3225260"," Look at that gap in HYG2."
"3227100","3231540"," HYG is going to gap all the way up to $77.82 to fill."
"3232920","3234000"," Dixie getting blooded. "
"3234680","3237980"," They had Dixie today up at $1.04 in change."
"3240000","3243840"," $1.04.15. That was from Japan."
"3245340","3249340"," The Japanese rate decision made Dixie blast off. "
"3250260","3259930"," Dixie currently at $14.05. We hit $5 "
"3259930","3264350",",200 if the Fed cuts a hike today or no catalyst needed."
"3264890","3266030"," No catalyst is needed."
"3266930","3266950"," None. "
"3268010","3273550"," The target for today, if you don't know, the target for today is $5.20. That is today's target."
"3275050","3277670"," 53 can come like it's nobody's business."
"3279730","3281710"," Fed is the Fed cutting today or not. "
"3281850","3282890"," I don't think that they are either."
"3283310","3290470"," If you weren't here yesterday, the highest probability for the Fed today is no rate cut, no rate"
"3290470","3291030"," increase."
"3291810","3292810"," That would be the expectation. "
"3294150","3300110"," Your next expectation would be a rate cut today, an unannounced rate cut."
"3300110","3307350"," The unannounced rate cut today, even if we get a rip to the upside, is bearish in my opinion."
"3308130","3310130"," I don't want to see a rate cut today. "
"3311870","3318630"," It can be perceived as bearish if we get a rate cut today because it's unexpected because it also"
"3318630","3324030"," shows that they've broken something that they haven't seen or they just found."
"3324810","3331610"," If they were to not cut today and cut at the next decision or in June, that would be perceived"
"3331610","3332870"," as a bullish."
"3333690","3336750"," So the perception today should be no rate cuts. "
"3337510","3344590"," If we got a rate increase today, the initial reaction would be bearish, but it would be a bullish"
"3344590","3346490"," thing."
"3346490","3353290"," So if you ever saw 25 DPS today, you would want to buy that dip or find a bottom down"
"3353290","3355350"," there too by to take the market long."
"3362350","3363870"," I'm trying to read"
"3363870","3378650"," what"
"3378650","3379790"," you guys are saying. "
"3380790","3384150"," It seems like more gambling to me, not gambling."
"3384470","3385910"," Well, how do I rephrase this?"
"3386050","3391350"," We were discussing this yesterday, so we were at three rate cuts, right?"
"3391710","3393070"," We were at seven rate cuts."
"3394710","3400430"," That seems to me like it was, remember we're at six rate cuts or some seven rate cuts heading into"
"3400430","3401270"," the into this year?"
"3402210","3408550"," And it seemed like more of a form or function of trading the market than anyone believing that. "
"3409230","3415210"," And I think the same thing holds true with, I think we're at three rate cuts a couple weeks ago."
"3415810","3419870"," And then we went down to like two rate cuts, what, a few days ago, right?"
"3420330","3428630"," So I think it's more a function of gambling, not based on any kind of reality."
"3435110","3437410"," So Chase is saying the window of weakness is now. "
"3437830","3437990"," Okay."
"3445330","3447590"," Yeah, I don't, I'm not a prescriber of that."
"3447670","3449650"," For me, it's gambling pure gambling. "
"3449990","3455810"," Anything that you see out there for rate cuts, any future, a fat, fat rate cuts."
"3456050","3456590"," It's all bullshit."
"3456810","3457410"," Whole thing is bullshit. "
"3457890","3458050"," Scam."
"3458890","3459150"," Fucking scam."
"3460110","3462390"," It's a bunch of people fucking gambling on how many rate cuts we're going to have. "
"3462670","3463010"," I'll be honest."
"3463230","3464250"," That's how simple it is to me."
"3466990","3469390"," Chase, I miss what you're saying, man. "
"3469390","3474470"," I saw a bunch of chat go by and I missed a bunch of what you guys are saying."
"3477910","3483430"," Are they coming out or are they coming out and discussing this morning that the windows open to go"
"3483430","3483890"," to 5,300?"
"3484470","3485850"," Am I the only one saying that in public?"
"3495410","3497430"," Yeah, put out a Tesla update this morning."
"3498050","3502070"," We put out a Tesla update Monday or Sunday for Monday, Wednesday and Friday. "
"3502390","3503490"," You should have one this morning."
"3504250","3509070"," We update Tesla every two days on the website and try the trigger.com."
"3510370","3512610"," Yes, every day or every other day."
"3512770","3513630"," We do a Tesla update. "
"3514250","3515610"," You can ask that all the time."
"3520500","3525380"," Markets are a little changed out of the FOMC rate, FOMC rate decision today."
"3525960","3527640"," 2 p.m. GEM situation is straightforward. "
"3527640","3530960"," Call wall 5,200 GEM flip 5,150."
"3531240","3532340"," Zero date."
"3532620","3534060"," Call wall was 5,190. "
"3535320","3542040"," Short term interest rate futures are implying 64 BPS and cuts for 2024 and we think the probability"
"3542040","3546700"," is low, but the Fed will telegraph to substantially more hawkish path."
"3547440","3554540"," But Powell likely will signal a higher for longer long term neutral rate as several Fed speakers"
"3554540","3560320"," have indicated they are open to this idea, which is really very common sense given the fiscal"
"3560320","3560820"," dominance."
"3562060","3569600"," So today look for Jerome Powell to signal a higher for longer term neutral rate. "
"3570560","3574060"," That's coming out this morning from the boys over at GEMLabs."
"3576340","3580260"," I'm going to read to you some of what CMBC is saying this morning."
"3588740","3590840"," I hope I don't lose my voice this morning. "
"3591020","3596960"," The Fed has to do a lot at its meeting this week, but ultimately may not end up doing a"
"3596960","3600780"," whole lot in terms of changing the outlook for monetary policy."
"3601860","3607460"," The meeting will likely be all about the Fed open market committees dot plot of individual members"
"3607460","3609260"," interest rate expectations."
"3610500","3615480"," Officials also will release their quarterly update on the economy specifically for gross domestic"
"3615480","3619120"," product inflation and the unemployment rate. "
"3619440","3621880"," These are all sources of volatility today."
"3623340","3625160"," The Federal Reserve has a lot to do."
"3625160","3630820"," It's meeting this week, but ultimately may not end up doing a whole lot in terms of changing the"
"3630820","3635040"," outlook for monetary policy in addition to releasing its rate decision. "
"3635340","3636820"," Actually, let me just stop there for a minute."
"3637480","3640820"," So the CMBC is pushing an narrative today, right?"
"3641920","3651160"," That the Fed is going to actually change its language to a higher for longer and not to expect rate"
"3651160","3651500"," cuts."
"3652320","3656340"," In addition to releasing its rate decision after the meeting wraps up Wednesday, the central bank"
"3656340","3662140"," will update its economic projections as its unofficial forecast for the direction of interest rates"
"3662140","3664560"," over the next several years. "
"3665780","3674700"," Spooze squeezing right now, trading $5.15.97. Yet the general feeling is that policymakers will"
"3674700","3682180"," stick to their recent messaging, which has emphasized a patient data driven approach with no hurry"
"3682180","3686840"," to cut rates until there's greater visibility on inflation."
"3687360","3688580"," Boy, they're really fucking there."
"3688900","3692660"," Like, I'll tell you what, I don't know what rate decisions you guys are sitting in. "
"3692660","3698720"," I don't know what you guys are watching out there, but whatever CMBC is watching, but they were"
"3698720","3703800"," extremely dumbish, the last Fed rate decision."
"3704340","3706640"," In my view, they were extremely dumbish."
"3706880","3711700"," So they're pretty much saying, maybe pulling back the reins on that dumbishness. "
"3712420","3721580"," Spooze now trading $5.16.10. I'm not buying this bullshit from CMBC this morning."
"3721580","3727560"," Yet the general feeling is that policymakers will stick to their recent messaging, which emphasized"
"3727560","3733160"," a patient data driven approach with no hurry to cut rates until there's greater visibility on"
"3733160","3733480"," inflation."
"3734240","3736920"," I'll tell you guys what, man, they need a story. "
"3737460","3742560"," They need a story because that is what I posted this morning."
"3743120","3750140"," I posted on Twitter this morning, what shit are you going to make up for a story for the market"
"3750140","3751200"," of when they're going to cut rates?"
"3751960","3754120"," What bullshit are you going to make up out there?"
"3756960","3758660"," Like, this kills me, man."
"3758940","3760340"," They always need a story. "
"3761600","3765220"," They'll make it clear that they're obviously not ready to cut rates."
"3765900","3771440"," They need a few more data points to feel confident that inflation is heading back to target."
"3771740","3773000"," This is all bullshit, by the way. "
"3773000","3776220"," I said Mark Zandy, chief economist at Moody's Analytics."
"3776880","3779660"," I expect them to reaffirm three rate cuts this year."
"3780140","3782760"," So that would suggest the first rate cut would be in June. "
"3783600","3784280"," That's true."
"3785740","3787320"," That's what they've always said."
"3789040","3791100"," So I don't know why we're having this. "
"3791260","3796600"," I don't know why CMBC is having this conversation of more doom and gloom."
"3797100","3798340"," That's not what the Fed's going to do."
"3798520","3800200"," It's not what Jerome does. "
"3801080","3802740"," Jerome is not known for this."
"3803220","3808480"," So I'm patiently waiting for what Jerome has to say today."
"3809300","3815880"," You can bet your ass that you can bet your ass, right, that he's going to be questioned today. "
"3815880","3818100"," Are we getting a rate cut in June?"
"3818900","3821480"," People are going to want to know if that's the case."
"3821820","3825620"," And he was quite dovish in his last appearance."
"3825960","3827440"," Remember that he was quite dovish. "
"3827440","3833440"," He didn't change stance and become a hawk in the last rate decision."
"3833780","3835780"," And I don't expect that today either from him."
"3836900","3841540"," Markets have had to adjust to the Fed's approach and the fly, scaling back both the timing and"
"3841540","3844060"," frequency of expected cuts this year. "
"3844480","3849920"," Earlier this year, traders in the Fed funds futures market were anticipating the rate cut campaign"
"3849920","3850860"," to kick off in March."
"3851820","3852640"," Bullshit, right?"
"3853240","3853960"," All bullshit."
"3853960","3861980"," And continue into the FMC had cut the equivalent of six or seven times in increments of quarter"
"3861980","3863080"," percentage points. "
"3863980","3866260"," So we can tell right now that it's all bullshit, right?"
"3866900","3872460"," Now the market has pushed out the timing until at least June, with only three cuts anticipated in"
"3872460","3880520"," the current target range of 5.25%, 5.5%, for the Fed's benchmark, overnight borrowing rate."
"3880520","3886800"," The swing and expectations will make how the central bank delivers its message this week all the"
"3886800","3887480"," more important."
"3889540","3891420"," Think about this for a minute. "
"3892240","3898120"," Think about the logic that is here."
"3899420","3900840"," All right, you got no rate cuts."
"3901580","3904500"," You have an expectation of three rate cuts this year. "
"3905780","3912940"," And you have to write a story because they get back into a corner of what are they going to"
"3912940","3913120"," do?"
"3913700","3920980"," Are you going to try to sell me a story that after today or after today you're going to sell"
"3920980","3924480"," me a story that you might not get a rate cut in June."
"3925280","3930520"," They're going to have some emergency rate cut meetings in September or October or December."
"3931780","3935380"," You know, the rope that you've been given, right?"
"3936020","3937880"," If you're a bear, you're hot. "
"3938740","3942680"," The rope that you've been given has pulled away from you from with time."
"3943880","3946080"," Time has been taken away from you."
"3947420","3949580"," We know what the market does. "
"3950820","3953060"," They price this shit in before it happens."
"3953060","3962380"," And the longer that the Fed delays, the more dovish they will become as they get closer to the"
"3962380","3964140"," inevitability of a rate cut."
"3965840","3970700"," Spy now trading 516.32 did not get a dip by this morning. "

"4004290","4007010"," I warned you guys this morning, so I'm only going to say it."

"4467040","4470860"," It found 7% of our respondents think the President-elect..."
"4470860","4471320"," There's mad."
"4471620","4474700"," No influence on the Fed's decision about whether the cut..."
"4474700","4478260"," 12% thinks those cuts could be more likely than 15% less likely."
"4479020","4484460"," 88% say the Fed would just go ahead and reverse course and hike, if needed, despite the"
"4484460","4490680"," presidential election, while a small contingent 12% thinks that it would make them less likely to"
"4490680","4491020"," do so. "
"4491460","4495620"," All of that is to say, survey respondents, and I think the market itself, Now, take the Fed at"
"4495620","4500920"," their word that they are data dependent with no obvious serious economic risk right now on the"
"4500920","4501280"," horizon."
"4501580","4502700"," Who's begging for this?"
"4502860","4504380"," Is this like the bond market guys?"
"4504720","4506360"," He's like bond bros doing this."
"4506640","4512180"," In the decision making about when and how much to cut guys, not necessarily the political cycle. "
"4512440","4512520"," Sarah?"
"4513280","4513700"," All right."
"4513860","4514280"," Thank you, Steve."
"4514500","4515120"," Steve Lee's friend. "
"4515420","4517880"," I think they're basically saying the Fed's going to come on to be a hawk today."
"4518280","4520200"," Is that the change in the language for hawkish?"
"4520640","4520980"," Is that wrong?"
"4521300","4522120"," Am I missing something here?"
"4522120","4527400"," I expect the number of Fed rate cuts will be less than the market is currently expecting from our"
"4527400","4529200"," Federal Reserve chair for supervision."
"4529680","4530860"," Randy Quarles joins us now. "
"4531040","4534760"," It's good to have you back just on that point that Steve left it on the politics."
"4535160","4537560"," And I guess it's good that people don't expect the Fed to be political."
"4537840","4542260"," The Fed goes to great lengths to state its independence and to prove it. "
"4542880","4547940"," However, you know, we talked to Vince Reinhardt yesterday, who's at B&Y Mellon now, formerly at the"
"4547940","4548140"," Fed."
"4548300","4550500"," And he said they might not talk about it."
"4550500","4554280"," And it won't come up in the minutes, but it'll be on all of their minds that if they wait"
"4554280","4560960"," for a rate cut in the third quarter, that is going to be perceived, or at least there will be"
"4560960","4563040"," headlines about the Fed cutting into the election. "
"4563700","4563980"," Do you agree?"
"4564380","4565080"," You are at the table."
"4565800","4567100"," Yeah, I'm with you, JC."
"4567720","4574760"," Like, why now would he, this is like, this looks like fucking theater from CNBC, or at least the"
"4574760","4574940"," news. "
"4576020","4576460"," Please."
"4576460","4578280"," This looks like bullshit for headlines."
"4578280","4588640"," In the discussions, and that affect the decisions that people are making, you"
"4588640","4593540"," know, obviously the fact that there's an election going on, the members of the committee won't be"
"4593540","4601120"," unaware of that, but it really won't affect their decisions about what they need to do with respect"
"4601120","4602340"," to monetary policy. "
"4602340","4609380"," Yeah, I don't, do you guys, I don't recall, like, why would Powell change his stance?"
"4610360","4613860"," I don't understand this, I'm trying to, is this just for headlines?"
"4614240","4614980"," It has to be, right?"
"4615180","4619900"," It's moving, but it's not moving at the rate that would be necessary for interest rates to come"
"4619900","4623540"," down as quickly and to the degree that markets are currently expecting."
"4623540","4633640"," I think that there's frequently in market assessment of the Fed's likely policy path of"
"4633640","4640340"," view that, well, 2% was a rather random or at least arbitrary target, so they don't have to get"
"4640340","4642560"," down to 2% before they can declare victory."
"4642740","4647380"," They could declare victory at 3%, and that's just not how the Fed is going to think. "
"4647380","4654660"," They don't have to get all the way down to 2%, but if inflation remains higher than their..."
"4654660","4657860"," Dude, they always go for 2%, like what do these guys say?"
"4658620","4659340"," We can see it."
"4659440","4662020"," With lower interest rates as quickly as markets are expecting."
"4662300","4667380"," I think it has closer to 2.5 as opposed to 2.9 before they can say, now we can"
"4667380","4668240"," start lowering into..."
"4668240","4674200"," Well, 2.9 is core PCE, so it excludes food and energy if you factor into energy, which people do,"
"4674460","4677120"," it's at 2.4% the year of..."
"4677780","4681360"," Now they're saying that they don't have to hit 2% of like they do. "
"4681720","4683000"," They fucking do it every time."
"4683220","4688680"," You can see the rate of inflation come down and slam in at 2% every single time."
"4691220","4696740"," That's sort of the effect of monetary policy, the effect of other..."
"4696740","4697420"," Yeah, nothing's changed. "
"4697820","4700540"," I'm with you at JCM, with you, Jimmy Barry."
"4700860","4701420"," I'm with you too."
"4701420","4703900"," I need to see that come back down closer to their target. "
"4704600","4707680"," So when do you guess that that will happen?"
"4707820","4709140"," When do you think the first rate cut comes?"
"4709140","4710720"," Markets now circling around June?"
"4712720","4720860"," Certainly not before June, and I think that it's possible that if we don't see further progress on"
"4720860","4727320"," some of these measures, that the Fed has been very clear that they're focusing on the measures of"
"4727320","4733920"," tightness in the labor market and the inflation target that you might not even see a rate cut in"
"4733920","4734340"," June."
"4735300","4742320"," So I would say that the current market expectation I think is for three cuts weighted towards the"
"4742320","4750580"," end of this year, I think two is more likely given the way that I expect the environment to evolve"
"4750580","4756640"," over the course of the next couple of bears around, and it's possible that that would mean that"
"4756640","4757720"," there wouldn't be a cut even in June."
"4758220","4761920"," I know I'm watching this guy right now, I'm like, they're just making shit up now. "
"4762040","4764600"," They go from three where they were in September this year to two."
"4765280","4767500"," Randy, thank you very much for the time today, I really appreciate it."
"4767540","4772320"," I must be watching the different Fed speaker, different Jerome Powell. "
"4772620","4777060"," The jewelers are down this morning, despite what was a bead of earnings estimates, we're going to"
"4777060","4778700"," talk about the quarter that will be next."
"4778700","4780960"," Oh, hell no, I'm with you, Jimmy."
"4781320","4784180"," I realize they're fudging the inflation, for sure. "
"4784940","4786700"," They're most definitely fudging it."
"4789460","4795520"," I was looking at, I was looking at, well, well, I don't know that they're, I shouldn't say they're"
"4795520","4796540"," fudging inflation."
"4797840","4804380"," We were discussing, hold on a minute this year, we were discussing the other day, so Jimmy is"
"4804380","4808960"," saying, Jimmy's saying, the stock market is up, the oil is up, poppers up, cocoa is up, commodities"
"4808960","4810960"," up, housing prices are up, you're not seeing inflation. "
"4811940","4818920"," So there is a key point here, and this was an, this was a comment section in a Reddit post"
"4819600","4820780"," earlier in the week."
"4822420","4830740"," And I couldn't believe that people couldn't grasp the concept that you're still not stopping the"
"4830740","4832780"," price of things going up."
"4833440","4838620"," If the rate of inflation, let's talk about this real quick again, because we have, I guess we have"
"4838620","4839640"," to discuss this again. "
"4840800","4842900"," So you have the rate of inflation, right?"
"4844260","4849360"," This is eggs are two bucks, right, two dollars, eggs."
"4850880","4857880"," The rate of inflation two percent means that the price of eggs goes up at two percent every year."
"4858640","4860000"," Does that make sense to you?"
"4861040","4862660"," So a decade passes, right?"
"4862960","4868180"," Eggs are now, let's say they're out of two dollars and 12 cents now, right?"
"4868360","4869560"," Two dollars and 12 cents. "
"4870400","4874920"," We have COVID, COVID rate of inflation went up, we're, we're eight, nine percent, right?"
"4875100","4879840"," Just blast it off, blast off, right?"
"4880340","4884000"," Eggs now, six dollars, right?"
"4888410","4893010"," They bring inflation back in line, where it's at three, four percent, right?"
"4893270","4894550"," Ooh, right back down here again."
"4896950","4904790"," There's an expectation, there's an expectation from a lot of people that when the rate of inflation"
"4904790","4912830"," comes down, that eggs should come back down to two bucks, maybe like two fifty or something."
"4914070","4919410"," That is not the case, that is not what happens, that is not what happens. "
"4920330","4926810"," The rate of eggs is now like six dollars and two cents."
"4929490","4930590"," Does that make sense?"
"4930870","4931790"," Six dollars, two cents."
"4932410","4938350"," It doesn't come back down to two fifty, it just slows the rate of the price of eggs. "
"4939190","4948950"," So, if you really want the price of eggs to come back down to two dollars, so is there inflation?"
"4949530","4957490"," Yeah, we jumped about a decade ahead, about a decade, we literally threw, we threw like a decade,"
"4957490","4961150"," if not more, in like a year, right?"
"4961870","4966950"," Like, you get two dollar eggs, now you got six dollar eggs, how do you get eggs back to two"
"4966950","4967330"," dollars?"
"4968490","4971290"," It's not by year over year inflation of two percent, is it?"
"4973270","4975050"," No, you have to go into deflation, right?"
"4975550","4980150"," You have to get above or below, you have to get the year over year inflationary to go negative,"
"4980150","4980630"," right?"
"4982390","4987570"," You don't do that with five percent, six percent interest, or interest rates, do you?"
"4987710","4989510"," You got to go way, way, way, way higher, right?"
"4993430","4995570"," Yeah, so we had that conversation yesterday."
"4996150","5004190"," There's an expectation of, people are expecting when inflation comes down, that the eggs are going"
"5004190","5009830"," to go to two dollars, that's not what happens, that's not how it goes, the rate of inflation has"
"5009830","5020050"," nothing to do with the price of eggs, he is, he's"
"5020050","5030050"," a dove, he's a dove, he will solve our issues, 100 percent, it will"
"5030050","5030970"," take some time."
"5038250","5045010"," That's right, deflation is necessary, you would have to have basically negative inflation, right?"
"5045210","5050810"," You have to have like point minus point zero five, you begin to bring the pricing down for all of"
"5050810","5058010"," these goods back to pre-2019, or maybe slightly like if it was normal two percent inflation, I"
"5058010","5064310"," guess eggs would be up at another 25 cents or something, absolutely. "
"5065690","5067190"," We know that, right?"
"5067390","5068570"," The Fed has to do what?"
"5072130","5073810"," Destroy employment, right?"
"5074750","5079090"," Destroy demand, and that's not their mandate supposedly, right?"
"5080350","5087870"," Or a recession, or a depression, any of those things, war, something big, right?"
"5088090","5090850"," That would be the only way that you'd get the price of eggs to ever come back down."
"5091310","5098270"," You cannot correlate the price of goods to the year of year inflation in terms of like a pullback"
"5098270","5102650"," in prices, it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen when we're at three or four percent"
"5102650","5110350"," either, year of year inflation, can we get a green-hulk dick to 520?"
"5113570","5119330"," I think I'm with Uncle JBJ on this one today, if I had to do my own thing, I wonder"
"5119330","5123470"," if it's a big nothing burger, if this rate decision, sometimes you have rate decisions where"
"5123470","5124430"," they're a big nothing burger."
"5126430","5136300"," A great value, large white eggs, $12.02 and $0.06 active price right now, so let's"
"5136300","5137060"," ask that question. "
"5137800","5146300"," So we're going to talk real pricing, real pricing, what were a great value rack of eggs, how much"
"5146300","5147580"," did they cost pre-COVID?"
"5148260","5150060"," I know what they cost, a dollar, right?"
"5150760","5153180"," They'd be on sale for 99 cents, right?"
"5153180","5156620"," So now we're double that price right now, double."
"5161100","5166320"," If you think about how JPOW's actions, he participated perhaps the loosest monetary policy in U.S."
"5166440","5170820"," history, I know there's COVID which muddies the picture, but I think his actions are clear."
"5171440","5171880"," 100%. "
"5173200","5176160"," Sam's saying 89 cents, they were 89 cents at one time."
"5180440","5187420"," Yeah, organic eggs are like six bucks, I know what they cost, I got kids, man."
"5192400","5196200"," But it is used to be 17 cents a pound. "
"5200580","5206410"," They went up to like four bucks and then came back down."
"5208810","5212030"," Yeah, I don't see any de-disinflation and anything."
"5212470","5219290"," So between my taxes, my taxes are through the fucking roof, like they're just obscene right now. "
"5220490","5226490"," I got one tax, I got one of my tax rate increases, said you're getting this one because we think"
"5226490","5234190"," everybody, literally, we think everybody rehab their house, because they are remodeled tax for"
"5234190","5235870"," every homeowner in my town."
"5236330","5240930"," Cool cost is minus 15 with a previous of minus 15 spot five."
"5244230","5249130"," I think the, I think the, you know, another thing that we could do here would be, what are you"
"5249130","5252870"," guys thoughts on a tax for the ultra wealthy?"
"5254030","5263290"," That's something that, that's something that, what's his name always says, the now, the guy who's"
"5263290","5268050"," found the, who's now a, now a hippie, Ray Dalio is always like, hey, at the end of a debt"
"5268050","5280630"," cycle, you'll see the ultra wealthy get hammered with taxes, saying yes"
"5280630","5283290"," and give the, give the money to the people. "
"5283290","5284130"," Don't do that."
"5284990","5286470"," Don't tax the ultra wealthy."
"5290150","5292270"," They pay at least the same effective rate. "
"5293710","5298210"," Yeah, Ray Dalio talks about this."
"5298430","5303310"," He discusses that it's not so much, much a function of whether we want it or not, but it's a,"
"5303530","5305750"," it happens in these cycles."
"5311200","5316560"," Just need to count loans secured by, I'm, I'm missing some of you guys are saying here. "
"5320390","5324250"," That should be the first thing you should do the ultra wealthy don't need all that up in money."
"5325050","5333530"," Yeah, there's a, we had a discussion on the show recently about, we"
"5333530","5341710"," had a discussion on how this is going to sound crazy to some of you, some of you are probably"
"5341710","5347830"," here for that discussion, but some of you probably weren't, how the new rules that were put in"
"5347830","5356950"," place during the GFC kind of forced people to not take out risky loans,"
"5356950","5358250"," right?"
"5358250","5368150"," So if you're a home buyer, after the real estate meltdown, what I noticed was that"
"5368150","5375930"," people were buying homes with cash and they were also taking loans that were private loans."
"5376470","5378730"," They weren't taking traditional mortgages. "
"5380010","5387030"," I noticed a lot of guys were taking hard money loans and when you take a hard money loan, the"
"5387030","5388530"," rules are strict."
"5389510","5393230"," Like you got to, you got to do the flip, you got to put it on market, you got to"
"5393230","5399150"," get it sold and there's a time, like the clock is ticking the entire time."
"5399870","5404770"," Those guys, I watched these guys, what they did was they started, they started taking the profits,"
"5405430","5410790"," they started buying their own houses with their own cash and they started funding their own rehabs. "
"5410850","5416610"," Now they do take mortgages out against these homes if they buy and hold so they can make free,"
"5416710","5418450"," interest free money, right, free loans."
"5419090","5426330"," But the one big difference that I noticed was that you weren't allowed anymore to just take"
"5426330","5431970"," bullshit loans with bad credit, no job, like own two, three, four houses, just sitting there."
"5432870","5438110"," There's like an effect from that that is bad for young people today. "
"5438770","5448030"," So because you're forcing people into being more responsible with risk,"
"5448670","5460660"," some of the effect of that is wealthier people, believe it or not, you"
"5460660","5465700"," end up getting people that are more resilient in their wealth."
"5475060","5483100"," And I look at Spotify, think tight, I'm just going to put it up for you here in the background."
"5484960","5496290"," CMG with a little bit of a roll going on, Spotify with"

"5513410","5520010"," volatility right here, you have to work through, but you did just tag your last, you did just tag"
"5520010","5528070"," right here, that one right there, you just tagged, you've got some work to do on Spotify, you've"
"5528070","5537970"," got a lot of volatility right in here, with a full"
"5540270","5557970"," your next upside target is 262, the one"
"5557970","5565910"," thing I don't like about Spotify here is I do not like, I don't like all of this right here,"
"5566130","5576570"," let's have some aggressive selling going on in here, if Spotify loses $250, 34,"
"5577230","5588050"," you're looking at a 50 point drop, I'll leave that"

"5814930","5842860"," BC, good"
"5842860","5853040"," Wednesday morning, welcome to Money Movers, I'm Sarah Eisen with Mike Santoli, today"
"5853040","5857980"," live from post 9 of the New York Stock Exchange, former Fed Governor Randy Krosner with us on one"
"5857980","5862120"," of the best I should be listening for this afternoon during the Fed decision and news conference,"
"5862580","5867440"," then Intel awarded eight and a half billion dollars in chip sack grants with billions more in"
"5867440","5873220"," incentives, stock, office early highs, we are live on the ground in Arizona this hour, but some are"
"5873220","5880120"," calling it 2024's first AI IPO, a sterile lab, making its public debut on the NASDAQ, the maker of"
"5880120","5885480"," data center components, counts Intel as a backer and AMD and NVIDIA as customers, we're going to"
"5885480","5886820"," talk to the CEO in just a moment."
"5887240","5893020"," First up though, on the markets ahead of the Fed decision, we've turned positive on the S&P 500"
"5893020","5898900"," after the S&P had a sharp rally yesterday and the nice little turnaround, NASDAQ is lagging today,"
"5899120","5904260"," but just barely, not a lot of action going into the Fed meeting, though buying a bonds, we saw that"
"5904260","5906500"," yesterday, we're seeing that continue today."
"5907160","5911740"," Mike, I said last hour feels a little bit hawkishly positioned even though the stock market has"
"5911740","5917040"," been strong because we've had some wobbles in recent weeks and also yields a bush tire, the dollar"
"5917040","5922820"," is stronger, maybe the market is anticipating a change from three dots or cuts this year in"
"5922820","5926260"," projections to two and maybe a more hawkish tone from Powell. "
"5926540","5930700"," I think there's no doubt the bond market is bracing for something like that, just where yields have"
"5930700","5930860"," gone."
"5931040","5935760"," I actually see the little buying the last couple of days in Treasuries almost as it kind of going a"
"5935760","5938520"," little more toward neutral ahead of the meeting because you don't really know what you're going to"
"5938520","5940700"," get because it has been such a huge jump in yields."
"5940980","5945840"," If you just do the language analytics of Fed speak, it has been more obvious. "
"5945840","5948060"," They have been emphasized they're not going to be in a big hurry."
"5948680","5949580"," They want more data."
"5950000","5954900"," That being said, I think the good news is that this has not really been a Fed driven market"
"5954900","5955440"," principally. "
"5956240","5958640"," So therefore, you have other things to fall back on."
"5958680","5961760"," You mentioned the sharp rally yesterday, continued shows of resilience."
"5962360","5966320"," This market keeps looking at these perfectly good excuses to pull back in a broad way and it"
"5966320","5967080"," doesn't do it. "
"5967360","5968360"," It will at some point."
"5968620","5970960"," It's still kind of maintaining this overbought position."
"5971400","5973980"," But I was, you know, looked down the list outside of tech even. "
"5974260","5976820"," JP more market is not overbought right now."
"5976940","5978300"," Do not listen to that bullshit."
"5978960","5980380"," Market is not overbought. "
"5980500","5981160"," Not just tech."
"5981440","5982920"," Tech has definitely lost some momentum."
"5983020","5988120"," The overall market has really slowed down a bit, even though it's making new highs, but 18 new"
"5988120","5993060"," highs in the first quarter of a year is it's kind of a record pace for how many you're going"
"5993060","5993700"," to get over a calendar. "
"5993920","5994660"," Yeah, obviously not necessarily."
"5994680","5995080"," Yeah."
"5995120","5999760"," I mean, if you want to tell me that the market, so in January, the market is expecting the Fed"
"5999760","6002020"," to cut rates today, the March meeting. "
"6002260","6002400"," Yes."
"6002540","6004240"," And they expected rate cuts at every meeting."
"6004540","6007400"," That snapshot of the Fed fund's futures pricing said March. "
"6007400","6010520"," And we've taken all of those cuts out and left free for the market."
"6010520","6013340"," And the stock market has handled it relatively well to your price."
"6013640","6017040"," I don't argue with the economy as well has managed to fight to it. "
"6017140","6018140"," Well, that's part of the reason why."
"6018380","6022760"," Our next guest says to buy any weakness in this market as growth, stock momentum and a broadening"
"6022760","6025080"," in performance and equity is going to be more upside."
"6025300","6027680"," Joining us now by the post nine, you'll be on 12 minutes. "
"6027680","6031400"," I can't believe that I can't believe some of the stuff that these guys say."
"6031580","6039240"," So you have been like, Sammy C is like, Oh, the market's surprisingly resilient to the Fed"
"6039240","6040660"," maintaining higher rates."
"6041780","6045180"," Yeah, you can tell that's what happens when they raise rates. "
"6045180","6046660"," Driven by the Fed, right?"
"6047420","6052960"," There's a historical precedent for this and fundamental macro growth face market."
"6053500","6060360"," You can see that in the S and P be the fact that we hit an all time high in"
"6060360","6065620"," equal weight last week and see the fact that at this point in time, as this was as of yesterday"
"6065620","6073260"," morning, about 38% of the S and P 500 was trading has appreciated more than the S and P"
"6073260","6073620"," 500."
"6074180","6079780"," So what we are really seeing, I think, is much more enthusiasm, a celebration of an earnings"
"6079780","6088300"," recession behind of what AI is going to do, not only to technology companies, but everything from"
"6088300","6092280"," healthcare to industrials to reshoring to industrialization. "
"6092920","6098320"," And so I think today is really, you know, all about the dots, all about the dots and the"
"6098320","6098480"," projections."
"6098980","6103820"," So when you say this is an earnings driven fundamental rally, how much are earnings expectations"
"6103820","6105540"," rising?"
"6106020","6110280"," And does it match the kind of the rise in the market that we've seen in valuations?"
"6110760","6112420"," So ultimately, that's the question, right?"
"6112520","6114320"," When people are talking about, is there a bubble?"
"6114580","6115680"," Is there is there not?"
"6116080","6122800"," It is definitely true that especially for the Magnificent Seven for growth and for IT, we are at"
"6122800","6125660"," higher valuations than we have been in history."
"6126320","6128220"," However, we are looking for..."
"6128220","6129180"," That's not true either. "
"6129420","6132740"," This year, the people just fucking mix it up."
"6132860","6136280"," The earnings growth is not steady, right?"
"6136460","6138800"," We still see a lot of growth in..."
"6138800","6143040"," I just showed you the Ford PE ratio like half an hour ago."
"6143380","6147860"," With things like AI, they have a lot of cash on the balance sheet, they have very high returns on"
"6147860","6149200"," investment and returns on equity. "
"6150000","6155540"," You're also seeing things like healthcare that are going to benefit from AI, that really depress"
"6155540","6156120"," sentiment."
"6156620","6159700"," A lot of the tailwinds that have been in the market..."
"6160180","6161200"," It's mind-blowing."
"6161920","6165600"," My mind is blown listening to some of the shit they just..."
"6165600","6166960"," The tailwinds as we can..."
"6166960","6167880"," The shit they just spew. "
"6168440","6168760"," Strong economy."
"6169880","6174180"," But again, we're starting to see cracks, which makes us confident that we..."
"6174180","6175700"," Yeah, yeah, as a tag or a cool aid."
"6176020","6177240"," Which one are we pouring out today?"
"6177940","6183160"," If June is still 50-50, or if we're looking forward to August or September instead. "
"6183440","6187900"," Yeah, we'll see if they create more suspense about the next couple of months of data, which may"
"6187900","6188680"," well be the case."
"6189120","6194200"," I wonder how you think an investor ought to be treating this gift of very good year-to-date"
"6194200","6194580"," returns."
"6194860","6196120"," It's even been a global move. "
"6196380","6201460"," If you've owned a non-US market, outperforming bonds, you look at..."
"6201460","6202680"," There have been flows into equity."
"6202940","6205420"," It's actually a heavy flow in the last week, but also into cash."
"6205740","6208960"," Oh, actually, actually, there's been heavy flow into equities this week. "
"6209420","6211280"," It's a big investor that owned everything."
"6211620","6212340"," But we're over-bought."
"6212420","6217160"," We can be rebalance out of equities and making sure you have enough of a Christian elsewhere, or"
"6217160","6218940"," while staying involved. "
"6219880","6223860"," Yeah, so we've talked about this a lot on the show, about sort of the relative positioning between"
"6223860","6229880"," bonds, cash, and stocks, because cash has acted for the last number of years, almost like its own"
"6229880","6232500"," asset class, or fixed income surrogate."
"6233080","6239900"," So, although asset managers may be very into the markets relative to history, individuals still"
"6239900","6241460"," have a significant cash balance."
"6242200","6246520"," And the fact that there'll be no move today is almost going to create, I think, a false sense of"
"6246520","6248640"," security that that's the place to be. "
"6249060","6253700"," Because within the bond trade, the question that I've been getting the most is, you said this was"
"6253700","6255720"," going to work sooner rather than later."
"6256060","6258900"," You keep on saying, next month, next month."
"6259540","6261080"," And so, there's a little pushback there. "
"6261460","6266620"," I think broadening out your equity exposure, getting into a little more value, a little more small"
"6266620","6272220"," caps, if your baseline has rebalanced largely to large caps."
"6272800","6276960"," Your question to me is, do I think we're lower at the rate decision?"
"6277280","6279360"," I think we're trading 520 today."
"6279940","6280980"," I want to buy a dip. "
"6281560","6283360"," I don't like buying this."
"6283740","6284900"," I don't like the grind up."
"6285060","6286640"," I'm not not that kind of trader. "
"6287420","6290300"," For me, I like the pullback and buy a dip."
"6290580","6293520"," I don't like to be buying the grind up."
"6294460","6298840"," David AMS is saying, do not get short. "
"6299160","6301180"," See my note in pro traders this morning."
"6302520","6305940"," Cap, but hey, do you want me to, David, do you want to put you on the show, man?"
"6308240","6310080"," David, you want to come on the show and talk really quick?"
"6310740","6312080"," We can do that if you want."
"6314500","6317300"," I want to get out of the way. "
"6319060","6320340"," 50, 200 door open."
"6320520","6321460"," We can go straight to 53."
"6321600","6322500"," I don't like it's nobody's business. "
"6322920","6323260"," They don't believe."
"6323500","6324420"," I've told them already this morning."
"6324560","6325040"," They're telling me no. "
"6325160","6326080"," The election conversation."
"6326700","6328820"," But it sounds like your clients aren't over."
"6328860","6332920"," Yeah, David, let me say at this point, there's something get you on the show, man. "
"6333040","6333500"," Hold on, brother."
"6333580","6335040"," Between pessimism and optimism."
"6335720","6338200"," As you've seen reflected in the data, right?"
"6338400","6342800"," You see manufacturing, housing, industrials, really coming much. "
"6342900","6343480"," Make type of man."
"6343600","6348440"," I'm going to send you a link be a discord hit hard by the cost of debt."
"6348720","6348920"," Okay. "
"6349040","6349160"," All right."
"6349440","6350520"," I'll send you a link be a discord."
"6350740","6351540"," Take about five minutes. "
"6351580","6352820"," Feeling very differently."
"6353340","6354200"," Roger that, brother."
"6354280","6361360"," In some ways feels like a tale of two cities and people are waiting for the next information point"
"6361360","6363260"," to get bearish or hawkish. "
"6363260","6369180"," But I think today, and back to the expectations around this afternoon, I think that there's going"
"6369180","6370420"," to be a lot of."
"6370840","6371960"," Mr. Talking monkey."
"6372280","6373460"," Are you in discord?"
"6373840","6377680"," Check your DMs. Put the labor market in a year or in two years."
"6377900","6378640"," Where did they put GDP?"
"6379320","6384660"," And again, is there a reason to continue to have a fed multiples conversation?"
"6385140","6394460"," Because we all feel, 2023 and the beginning of 2024."
"6395120","6397780"," Well, we'll do an election conversation next time. "
"6397960","6400300"," I'm curious what you're telling your clients on that front."
"6400560","6402740"," Ali McCartney, thank you for maybe that's wealth management."
"6403280","6403560"," Bye bye. "
"6404000","6408800"," All right, turning to housing mortgage rates rising last week for the first time in three weeks,"
"6409020","6413500"," Dan Olick has more on how the Fed decision this afternoon could impact that market Diana."
"6414160","6415720"," Well Mike, it's all about rates, right?"
"6416160","6420820"," Because now home prices are still gaining and we have tight supply continuing to push prices"
"6420820","6421220"," higher."
"6421680","6425460"," So you saw it in last week's mortgage demand mortgage rates rose last week for the first time in"
"6425460","6425840"," three weeks. "
"6426160","6429520"," And as a result, demand came down for the first time since February."
"6429900","6435200"," The average rate on the 30 year fixed rose to 6.97% from 6.84. Now that was last"
"6435200","6437580"," week's average from the mortgage bankers association."
"6438060","6441240"," All right, David, I put a link into your DMs daily. "
"6441520","6443800"," You see that by Thursday, the rate had crossed back."
"6444040","6445660"," Do we have a discord only subscription?"
"6445920","6446720"," Yes, we do."
"6447060","6450500"," We've got so here's the deal here on what we've got going on here. "

"6753710","6754630"," I can hear you now, brother. "
"6754730","6756250"," Hold on here."
"6756330","6756870"," Okay, everybody."
"6757150","6763590"," It's just still getting So we've got, we've got David AMS coming up right now. "
"6763990","6765730"," David, are you ready to go out, go on or no?"
"6766470","6769690"," Uh, hold on one second, let me get myself set up."
"6771050","6775070"," I, um, so you are live, by the way, we can hear your voice on the show."
"6775730","6776470"," All right, cool. "
"6777730","6779130"," Hold on one second, yep."
"6779330","6781070"," I'll put, let me know when you want me to put you on the screen."
"6782110","6783110"," Yeah, hold on one second. "
"6783870","6787550"," So I just want to let you guys know we have David AMS on the show this morning."
"6787550","6791190"," He's going to come on and talk to you about what the expectations are for today."
"6791730","6798610"," You heard me tell you this morning that if we break above 5,200, that the door weight of 5 "
"6798610","6800470",",300 is wide open. "
"6801310","6806550"," So the ceiling or the door is not locked any longer once we get up there."
"6807390","6813770"," Uh, and to be very, very careful with being short today, uh, and that you can get your ass blasted"
"6813770","6814950"," this morning."
"6815430","6818130"," You can see we continue to grind higher right now. "
"6818130","6820010"," We're now trading 5, 5, 16, 23."
"6820730","6823870"," We broke above this orange band here earlier."
"6824190","6829870"," So your next target above is where 5, 16, 57, 5, 16, 69. "
"6830850","6836430"," And then the next target above there at our one is 5, 17, 43."
"6838070","6839310"," Give me just a moment here."
"6839390","6844390"," He's, he's trying to work on a, uh, a presentation for you to explain to you why to be careful"
"6844390","6846390"," as the morning moves forward. "
"6846710","6852450"," On the bottom part of your screen down here, you see IWM here, triple bottoming, right, sitting on"
"6852450","6854550"," its daily trigger awaiting the fed."
"6854970","6859750"," This goes counter, of course, to what CNBC has been pushing on you this morning."
"6859950","6864990"," There isn't it, which is a front running of an inevitable rate cuts in the future. "
"6864990","6873470"," We also know that Jerome Powell has not changed his speech or speak at any point."
"6874010","6879190"," Now there has been some floating of that idea from small, smaller fed presidents has been that"
"6879190","6881470"," floating of that idea on fin twitted."
"6881590","6888990"," There's been a float of that idea even this morning on CNBC that he's going to switch his speak"
"6888990","6890570"," more hockishly. "
"6891170","6892010"," Well, you know what?"
"6892130","6897310"," Maybe we're not going to cut rates this year or maybe we're not going to cut rates in June, uh,"
"6897410","6898310"," higher for longer."
"6898690","6900950"," Now, what are my thoughts on higher for longer?"
"6900950","6905570"," I like it the longer that we're the longer we stay higher for longer."
"6906100","6908090"," The safer bulls are. "
"6908830","6914530"," On my viewpoint from my viewpoint from previous history, the moment the fed starts cutting rates,"
"6914530","6918450"," uh, look out below is my, my mantra on that."
"6918810","6925290"," Now we haven't hit 2% inflation inflation and unemployment and employment has been bouncing around,"
"6925290","6926230"," right?"
"6926510","6932190"," No velocity in, uh, in any of those, uh, data points, right?"
"6932830","6935390"," We want a little bit up, a little bit down, a little bit up, a little bit down."
"6935690","6941110"," And the longer that happens, the market remains safe for more upside moves. "
"6945110","6946610"," Just give me two more minutes, Scott."
"6946910","6947610"," No worries, brother."
"6947850","6957810"," Do you think, uh, well, no, so it doesn't really, that's"
"6957810","6958410"," a good question. "
"6959250","6961670"," IWM wants the cuts though, right?"
"6961670","6966250"," I don't think traders care if there's cuts."
"6966910","6969690"," You got to remember that this is like the fed buns rate."
"6970350","6971470"," This is all gambling. "
"6972250","6973750"," You guys don't get this, right?"
"6973890","6975510"," It's accumulation and distribution."
"6976290","6976970"," Not you particularly."
"6977430","6981750"," I mean, in general, like there's a thought out there that there needs to be rate cuts. "
"6981950","6982470"," There doesn't."
"6982950","6986510"," There just needs to be the story of a rate cut."
"6987010","6987490"," Does that make sense?"
"6988090","6991650"," So if they don't cut rates today, they're not going to cut rates. "
"6991650","6995890"," And there is going to be an anticipation that they are going to cut rates in June."
"6996470","7001670"," No matter what the garbage that comes out of CNBC's mouth is, and it doesn't matter if we cut rates"
"7001670","7002230"," in June."
"7002750","7007210"," There's an inevitability to it and the market will price it in is the point. "
"7007670","7013370"," The more rope that you take away from the inevitable cuts, the more a chance of this huge move"
"7013370","7014970"," into, hey, let's try it."
"7015510","7019070"," You know, like we're going to come into June and if we got a rate cut, the move will already"
"7019070","7019810"," have been made."
"7019810","7021490"," Does that make sense to you?"
"7023170","7029790"," Yeah, it's like, it's like, you can't tell me, you're not going to sit there in CNBC and tell me,"
"7029790","7034690"," you know, the Fed's going to get all hawkish and you might not get a rate cut this year. "
"7035190","7040210"," These people are, they're like whores, like, or like, or buyers are like whores, right?"
"7041190","7046310"," They don't care if they think that they're getting a rate cut, they will price that shit in before"
"7046310","7047130"," we ever get there."
"7047130","7052990"," And they're not going to wait for the rate cut in June, they're just not going to do it."
"7053630","7058830"," You'll see it priced in and you'll see, you probably see CNBC at that point, say to you, when the"
"7058830","7063530"," eventual rate cut does come, pay, you should buy small caps now as they dump into you. "
"7064630","7065870"," Does that make sense?"
"7066270","7071540"," I don't know if it does or doesn't, but the hawkishness."
"7071540","7080040"," I don't, I'm with you, JC, his, his speech or speak, right, the Jerome speak has become more and"
"7080040","7083020"," more and more dovish over time."
"7083520","7085280"," It has not become more hawkish. "
"7085900","7086680"," We haven't had that."
"7086880","7093060"," If we got that today on a short term basis, yeah, the market can come down."
"7094440","7096290"," But I don't anticipate that. "
"7096780","7098720"," They haven't been adversarial towards us."
"7098900","7101400"," So I don't know why we're expecting that from them today."
"7104530","7107350"," IBM needs to be above 202 to show string. "
"7108010","7112970"," So IBM currently is parked on its daily trigger."
"7113490","7116190"," It is currently above its hourly trigger."
"7116910","7118470"," That's extremely bullish to me. "
"7118950","7120470"," That's, to me, that's bullish."
"7120830","7121630"," That's all I need to see."
"7122550","7127570"," Price, hourly trigger, daily trigger, all in order right now. "
"7129010","7132650"," So I see it as, I see it as bullish or at least currently at the moment."
"7142790","7146290"," Matter of fact, we're going to put some, we're going to put some sauce in this too."
"7146910","7147630"," Right there. "
"7148510","7150610"," 205, 203 and some change."
"7172500","7174260"," There's your IWM chart down below."
"7179150","7181730"," What is the chance they blast this to 5300?"
"7182610","7183590"," 10% chance. "
"7184390","7185430"," I think it's 25."
"7186430","7189250"," But for a two-signal move, 10% chance."
"7190330","7191170"," If they do it today. "
"7191890","7193010"," But again, we're in a fed day."
"7193190","7195290"," So I think anything could happen."
"7195430","7196630"," I think anything could happen today. "
"7197490","7201820"," You know, Chase, it's like, we can go to, I think we can go to 505 today."
"7202450","7204330"," 505, 530 all in today."
"7207430","7208950"," Depending on what the fed says. "
"7210590","7214650"," We have posted out the full coin desk article on our feed for all those interested."
"7224340","7227780"," Oh, that is to say, pick up some zero dates for late eight."
"7227960","7229720"," They've got eight sent calls for today for 530. "
"7230560","7231920"," I wouldn't get them that high."
"7232260","7233100"," I'd get them like 520."
"7233700","7234760"," I wouldn't get them that high. "
"7234880","7239520"," I would get them like 5.25s. Our three is at."
"7240760","7242420"," Our two is 519."
"7243380","7244720"," So 519 C."
"7246600","7247820"," Valhalla is 520. "
"7248440","7251620"," This is what people in the market think we're going to today."
"7253020","7255700"," Our three is 52231."
"7258600","7261240"," And then you've got this big zone up here. "
"7262260","7264180"," 54546 and 52861."
"7264880","7268920"," So I wouldn't necessarily get 530s chase if you're trying to take that trade today."
"7273100","7274600"," You know, it's crazy about the ads. "
"7274780","7275700"," I don't even get the money for them."
"7275740","7277060"," I keep playing music every day."
"7277520","7278720"," They take all the money for the. "
"7279380","7280580"," They take all the money for the ads."
"7281300","7282220"," I'm going to turn them off for today."
"7282300","7282620"," I'll turn them off. "
"7282660","7283220"," Hold on a second here."
"7283700","7284420"," Turn the ads off."
"7284520","7284880"," Hold on, man. "
"7284980","7285560"," I got you covered."
"7286140","7286840"," Hold on, JC."
"7289240","7290220"," Hold on one second, brother. "
"7302460","7306500"," Ads are off on YouTube, at least to which I don't know how to do those."
"7311920","7312840"," Hey, what's going on X?"
"7313000","7313240"," How are you?"
"7317900","7318780"," Hey, thank you, X."
"7319020","7319780"," I appreciate that."
"7320880","7323040"," He's been here since since day one. "
"7324860","7326200"," It's changed a lot, hasn't it?"
"7329630","7330390"," You know what I did?"
"7330590","7331150"," You know what I just got?"
"7332710","7333270"," Hold on."
"7333330","7333930"," Let me drink some water."
"7335030","7336110"," Whenever you're ready, David. "
"7336930","7337630"," Yeah, cool."
"7338730","7339390"," Are you ready?"
"7340610","7341010"," Yeah."
"7341710","7342130"," All right. "
"7342230","7342990"," Come back."
"7343170","7346350"," I got a laser show, man, and some fog machines, dude."
"7346790","7347390"," We're going to talk. "
"7347850","7349430"," I'm going to bring up David AMS really quick."
"7349430","7353090"," I'll discuss with you guys what his expectations are for today."
"7355090","7358090"," Well, you're warning David about this. "
"7359190","7365590"," In regards to expectations, what the reaction will be from the event itself."
"7366030","7372890"," I have no clue, you know, but I do have my levels pointed out and where I want to operate"
"7372890","7373510"," to and from."
"7374710","7377930"," Because it's a gamble for me to say what the pet is going to do. "
"7378250","7380770"," You know, if they cut, I don't know what they're going to do."
"7380930","7385230"," If the market's going to freak out because they think something's wrong and they could be seen as"
"7385230","7385730"," something good."
"7386130","7387750"," So, you know, we could go either way. "
"7389930","7393090"," And, you know, I like it when it's stable like this right now."
"7393830","7399350"," Because I don't have a feeling that they are pumping it to a place where they are going to dump"
"7399350","7400570"," it at the moment."
"7401830","7408510"," And I posted this morning in the pro traders chat also where I said, okay, how bad I want this"
"7408510","7412330"," thing to go down, you know, to get a better price to get the laws. "
"7414090","7416050"," You know, that's where I'm at, bro."
"7416270","7418490"," Like I'm like, I need to bounce somewhere."
"7419470","7420110"," Yeah, yeah. "
"7420710","7427210"," And I said that, but like, I mean, you know, the thing is, is that like the chart is not"
"7427210","7428690"," showing me that they're going to go down."
"7429690","7434750"," And did everything I was expected what what I expected it to do today."
"7435670","7438350"," And for London this morning to give you an idea. "
"7439050","7445450"," I think you guys are familiar sort of how I operate where I use the Asian session ranges."
"7446250","7449050"," And I base my trade plan for the day on that."
"7449870","7451430"," And nothing more nothing left. "
"7451910","7453130"," There's nothing fancy about it."
"7453130","7460590"," I look to see what the Asian range is to give you an idea how I operate since I mostly"
"7460590","7461450"," trade NASDAQ."
"7461890","7468170"," And you want to explain quickly to these people about the London open the Japanese open or the"
"7468170","7471990"," Asian open and then the New York US open. "
"7472550","7478550"," Yeah, I'm trying to clean up my charts for you guys to see it much better on what is happening."
"7479230","7485810"," Because like my day is basically planned around the Asian session ranges, which runs from 7 p.m."
"7485950","7487430"," New York time to midnight."
"7488570","7493670"," And there are a few levels that I plot out on my chart, and that is the Asian high, the"
"7493670","7495950"," Asian low and the midnight open. "
"7497270","7503690"," And what I do when I play plot these levels, I wait for breakdowns and breakouts from these levels."
"7504470","7513130"," So, and I plot the range deviation that I have for the Asian session ranges, because usually they"
"7513130","7516470"," will stay within one standard deviation of that Asian range."
"7517770","7526990"," And so I saw already one midnight open New York time that they were looking to accumulate below it. "
"7526990","7533730"," So, to give me an idea where I'm talking about here, you see this little green box here, I put"
"7533730","7534450"," an arrow on it."
"7535910","7537650"," See if I can make my screen a little bigger."
"7544100","7544380"," See. "
"7546160","7547380"," This little box here."
"7551460","7561630"," It says Asia right now, I don't do anything in this range, except for if I'm awake, but"
"7561630","7571390"," most of the time I wake up 5 a.m. My time, which is around 11 a.m. Eastern"
"7571390","7571690"," time."
"7572450","7575490"," And the only thing I'm waiting for is for the midnight open to print. "
"7576290","7583850"," And I like to position myself usually at 1 a.m. or either at 2 or 3 a.m. So,"
"7584250","7588430"," but the foundation of my trading is basically set on the four hour chart."
"7591050","7594750"," Blue lines you see are the four hour opening lines."
"7595630","7601710"," A lot of times the first hour move that happens in that four hour opening window is the fake one. "
"7602570","7604090"," And then they bring it back down."
"7604990","7610910"," Except for when you're in a discount in a specific area of a session or we've held a specific"
"7610910","7613750"," level."
"7614690","7619210"," Now, let's go back to the four hour chart to see what is happening because it's there's a lot of"
"7619210","7621570"," a lot of stuff going"
"7621570","7634070"," on"
"7634070","7634070"," in there. "
"7634070","7638710"," Because my end goal target for today is this red box here."
"7638970","7642170"," It's a four hour bearish for a value gap where we went through already."
"7642890","7648290"," But I'm expecting like a second rejection or something like that or trade trade through it. "
"7648790","7656130"," And then ultimately to reach 18,404 and take out the stops may be a nasty."
"7660770","7663630"," So, why was I looking for longs here."
"7664310","7666010"," Now, there are a few things that occur. "
"7667730","7671090"," I marked elastic and the first stick when futures opened up."
"7671890","7675870"," And there's a little gap that was created and I called them the new day opening up the day before."
"7676330","7677270"," But we held it. "
"7677530","7682410"," So, you know, that was the level that was tested overnight in Asia and they managed to bounce it"
"7682410","7682790"," back up."
"7685350","7687830"," Yesterday with the candle from Tuesday."
"7689010","7695290"," The low of that one, the week and the high from the candle from six a.m. on Tuesday. "
"7696310","7698350"," There's this four hour for a value gap here."
"7699630","7705010"," Now, typically, I want price to trade down into a discount."
"7706170","7706810"," To go back up. "
"7708590","7709870"," And it's not doing that."
"7709870","7711290"," Yeah, that's where I'm at, man."
"7711610","7713430"," Give me the dip. "
"7713570","7714290"," This guy never came."
"7714690","7717330"," So, you know, in my opinion, we are still trading in the premium."
"7717930","7720990"," You have to be very careful with taking the long. "
"7721210","7723070"," So, you know, I'm taking a bit by bit."
"7725010","7730290"," And, but, you know, whatever the five minute chart is telling me at that time, I need to trade on"
"7730290","7730530"," that."
"7730930","7737790"," So let's dive back into that chart to see what clues I saw this morning and why I went long. "
"7740090","7745190"," So, let me draw the box again for the Asian session because it's a bit more easier that way."
"7745490","7751190"," So we have this high here, which starts at nine a.m. And the midnight open is here."
"7751670","7754090"," So, basically, this is the even range here, right?"
"7755770","7757210"," I'm going to make it a different color. "
"7758470","7761450"," And I'll show you how I plan my day."
"7765380","7771460"," I have a tool that calculates this for me, but I'm going to show you manually to see how it's"
"7771460","7772880"," done because you don't need these tools."
"7773420","7781340"," I started doing this, drawing this myself because you know, you can slap on any indicator on your"
"7781340","7782160"," chart you want. "
"7782520","7787220"," But if you don't know how to use it and what to do with it, it's useless because in the"
"7787220","7789640"," end, you need to press a button at a specific time of day."
"7791320","7793500"," And yeah, trade from there."
"7795240","7797300"," So, what does this range mean?"
"7798280","7805140"," This range right here and the tighter the better, really, to be honest, but it basically tells me"
"7805140","7808100"," what are they planning to do for the entire day. "
"7808420","7810400"," So we have one standard deviation here."
"7812360","7812660"," Approximately."
"7813680","7816580"," I suggest using the bodies of the candles. "
"7816580","7826290"," And if you use the wicks, you can"
"7826290","7830030"," do it too, but it's more accurate when you do the bodies."
"7832810","7834170"," So this is one standard deviation."
"7839590","7841130"," See, one standard. "
"7864770","7865590"," Two standards."
"7869690","7873710"," And that is the reason why I, you know, for me, the market is very stable."
"7873710","7881850"," And I like because the power always said, what was his goal when COVID hit"
"7881850","7886770"," his primary focus at that time was market stability. "
"7888090","7889850"," And they've lived up to that word."
"7890130","7895150"," I mean, we've been grinding up, but we've had no weird shit happening anymore."
"7895170","7899710"," So, you know, I have to stick to see, you know, what they are telling me. "
"7900170","7900830"," Oh, sorry."
"7907540","7909280"," What kind of STDs do you have, Cap?"
"7909820","7910960"," That's what I'm looking right now."
"7911140","7913100"," I'm like, I'm looking right now. "
"7913260","7915360"," I'm like, you're just like, just like me, like."
"7916220","7918200"," I'm down a cap and gems cheap."
"7918460","7918940"," All right. "
"7924100","7925000"," All kidding aside."
"7925460","7925580"," Okay."
"7926120","7928000"," Anyway, you have this Asian range here. "
"7928000","7935200"," And look, the Asian high that I have marked here is the Asian high that I use for the session."
"7935680","7939620"," And I use that to see if we have a breakout or a breakdown from that level."
"7940060","7944100"," So, because there are two different types of highs and lows that I use. "
"7944460","7947640"," It's the one that starts at 7pm or at 8pm."
"7947640","7954220"," And I like the one that starts at 8pm because it narrows my scope a little bit more where I'm"
"7954220","7959260"," able to participate quicker or to take profit sooner."
"7960380","7965540"," And because let's say, for example, we're at the midnight open and right here and I have a feeling"
"7965540","7968660"," that they are accumulating below I start planning my trades like this. "
"7969400","7974380"," So, you know, in trading view, you have this beautiful trade planner that you can use and you can"
"7974380","7975180"," set your risk awards."
"7976320","7983960"," And you can do two to ones, for example, or, you know, you to the two risk award ratio."
"7984560","7987600"," And then, you know, it depends on your risk appetite, what you want to do. "
"7988820","7992660"," And you see, I don't need to go all the way up here or something like that, because if I"
"7992660","7999180"," know a specific move will happen from this area, I'll slap on some bigger size and trade towards"
"7999180","7999740"," that level."
"8001120","8009060"," So now, look, what is important to me, this, it's called NDOG, the new day opening gap is a magnet."
"8010060","8012720"," That number or that level will come in play. "
"8013160","8015240"," Now, why did I draw this NDOG?"
"8015480","8016900"," That means new day opening gap to me."
"8017720","8025260"," What we're going to do is go to the last stick, one futures markets close and the first opening"
"8025260","8025800"," take."
"8026680","8030420"," So my focus when I wake up is in this little box here. "
"8031140","8031520"," Okay."
"8033960","8036600"," I'll put an arrow and let's go to the one minute track."
"8038380","8039500"," We know where to go. "
"8050120","8051660"," So four things that I do."
"8057910","8058330"," Here we go."
"8070680","8071160"," Here we go. "
"8072160","8074920"," So this is the last stick right here."
"8076280","8078720"," From yesterday at 1659."
"8079300","8081560"," And then this is the first opening take. "
"8082180","8086080"," That little gap will come in play many times during the day."
"8086920","8090460"," I don't, since I'm sleeping in the Asian open, it doesn't really matter."
"8090900","8093100"," The thing is, is that when before London open. "
"8093700","8095160"," And we are below it."
"8095760","8096880"," I look for consequences."
"8097360","8101080"," Is there a chance that we could go retest that level back up?"
"8101860","8103220"," Yes, there is. "
"8103220","8110160"," Because at two o'clock, we're at one at one a.m. When we're down here and we're below the"
"8110160","8115060"," midnight open and I see enough range that I'm able to scout along towards that level."
"8116000","8116880"," I'll take it."
"8118080","8121520"," Now what I see happening here. "
"8122340","8123700"," I look for reversal patterns."
"8125300","8129900"," So this little consolidation area that you see here is very important to me."
"8130380","8135520"," I'm going to go back to the five minute chart and show you why that little consolidation part that"
"8135520","8138440"," happens in the Asian session comes back and play for the lesser today. "
"8139700","8141060"," And I leave that on my chart."
"8145530","8148790"," So what I look for is these buried for a value gaps."
"8150030","8151210"," These flushes down. "
"8152490","8155150"," And actually they start from here."
"8155690","8156870"," Yeah, I can see it over there too."
"8157550","8157930"," Yeah. "
"8157930","8163310"," And the only thing I do is I draw a box over like this."
"8170740","8172020"," And it doesn't matter how far."
"8174840","8178080"," This one's get tested here, but here you have another one. "
"8179000","8180420"," You see, there's another flush."
"8181540","8182860"," But it didn't make a new low."
"8184160","8186200"," And I don't care much about the wicks. "
"8186720","8188000"," I look at the bodies of the candles."
"8189120","8191840"," So whenever I see something like this happening."
"8192400","8196520"," The first thing I'm going to do is draw a little box like this. "
"8196980","8198860"," And I buy that one and leave my stop here."
"8199879","8202420"," So I'm already, I already look."
"8202719","8204660"," I'm looking for longs in this zone here. "
"8205480","8210580"," I have a low risk, you know, because I, my stops are only like five points on this part."
"8210920","8211900"," I can leave it as 10."
"8212059","8217240"," I start off with 60 ticks, especially in it actually can be a little problem, but. "
"8218120","8219660"," You know, it doesn't really matter."
"8220600","8223639"," Because like later in the day, it will come and play again."
"8224400","8225360"," So we. "
"8225580","8228040"," Just simply, I just want to drop here for a minute."
"8228139","8229420"," You're watching out there right now."
"8229459","8232360"," Do you see how David is tracking demand. "
"8233840","8236459"," Cross his chart from session to session."
"8238200","8242500"," And rather than chasing highs, things like that, he's looking for that same."
"8242780","8243820"," Where is the demand?"
"8244100","8245000"," Is that basically what you're doing?"
"8246719","8248160"," To simplify things. "
"8248379","8248780"," Yes, it is."
"8248900","8250420"," I'm trying to simplify it for him."
"8250680","8256080"," Because what is, you know, a lot of people, they think like a specific low is support or"
"8256080","8260120"," resistance, you know, but for me, once it breaks that. "
"8261059","8266459"," To me, something changes in my mindset where I'm able to join the trend in the opposite direction,"
"8266459","8271840"," for example, you know, so it's, it's my way of thinking is a bit different compared to everyone"
"8271840","8272760"," waiting for levels."
"8273740","8278100"," You know, I have these zones where where I want to pay attention to."
"8278540","8280900"," And then I look for the setups to occur. "
"8281139","8286340"," Now, you know, the problem today is, is because of that home seat, there's a lot of fuckery going"
"8286340","8286820"," along."
"8287940","8294459"," So it's, it's not as clean as it should be, which is okay, but they still work because then, you"
"8294459","8297080"," know, I still have my midnight open where I can rely on."
"8297920","8303480"," And the Asia session ranges where we've been playing around on for the entire day. "
"8304080","8310639"," So, you know, but nevertheless, in the in the in the London session, when the cash opened up."
"8311740","8318040"," The minute I see them messing around, making a new high breaking out of this consolidation range"
"8318040","8319480"," and they made it like, like."
"8320340","8322020"," You know, you join the party. "
"8322020","8325820"," So as soon as this breaks out, I start longing."
"8326820","8334280"," And I, and I start working towards this new day opening gap, which, you know, I'm already done for"
"8334280","8334580"," it."
"8334840","8340299"," You know, and even on this little breakout here, you see, let me take this green thing off. "
"8340879","8346360"," This was my ad here to continue on long because I started to scale out on this."
"8346940","8349740"," And I started accumulating lungs on this part."
"8350400","8352440"," I think I posted some charts in the discord. "
"8353400","8356480"," You can see where I executed on those traits."
"8357940","8361900"," I guys open up my account here because I have to log in back and trading to you."
"8362040","8368660"," I logged out to just in case if we get into a situation where I'm able to place a painter"
"8368660","8369760"," trade or something like that. "
"8369760","8373379"," Where we can try it together and show you how to execute them."
"8374900","8375379"," Now."
"8376160","8382639"," So are you saying you're still a buyer down around that 17, 79, 17, 79 or. "
"8383820","8385480"," 17, where are you?"
"8386059","8386559"," Say again."
"8387280","8388940"," Now, let me, I don't know."
"8389000","8389500"," I was still on. "
"8389680","8390060"," Let me see."
"8390320","8392760"," I'm looking at our index right now."
"8393240","8396240"," Well, yeah, you can see what I did here just now. "
"8396940","8399580"," This is a real trade that is that is going on."
"8399760","8402620"," I still have a runner on, but I wasn't paying attention to it."
"8402620","8406400"," So, you know, but I don't, I don't care much if it's going down because I'm skilled. "
"8406780","8411080"," So my average is 18 to 25 at the moment at the Asian low."
"8413080","8415440"," So you see this, this, let me see."
"8415640","8417160"," Are you able to see my drawing. "
"8418100","8418500"," Yeah."
"8419480","8419840"," Okay, cool."
"8420460","8420760"," Okay. "
"8420760","8425360"," So remember the midnight open that I pointed out on the chart."
"8425820","8429700"," And so one, when I wake up, I mark the Asian low."
"8431200","8434780"," And the Asia high and the midnight open. "
"8436080","8439120"," And then we have that new day opening gap that NDOG."
"8440740","8443440"," That you saw on the, on the thing here."
"8443800","8444120"," Let me see. "
"8445600","8447180"," There's little tiny box here."
"8448040","8448420"," Right here."
"8452140","8453980"," That's elastic and the first take of the day. "
"8455180","8461680"," So it's at 73 74th really tiny, you know, it doesn't happen often where it's."
"8462780","8463460"," Like that."
"8463900","8467720"," And there are a few other levels that I also take into account, which is the two o'clock. "
"8468340","8471220"," Open candle from yesterday and the daily clothes."
"8471220","8477020"," So, you know, all I have on my chart are these four levels and the rest I could care less"
"8477020","8477300"," about."
"8477580","8483380"," And what I look for is I like to look for sweeps either from a recent four hour high or"
"8483380","8483580"," low. "
"8485180","8488840"," And then look for these inversion for our value gaps that I buy up."
"8491060","8494070"," So what happened here."
"8499160","8502100"," I'm trying to see if I can show you a better example. "
"8503280","8504720"," What I did yesterday."
"8506640","8507240"," Oh, here."
"8507660","8510990"," Well, here's the same story. "
"8511230","8511310"," Right."
"8513530","8519710"," This is what I was trading yesterday and taking the long when everyone was buried in the afternoon,"
"8520070","8525190"," because at two, at two p.m. Like, Oh, this was, was this yesterday?"
"8526430","8526870"," Yeah."
"8527670","8528910"," That was great yesterday, wasn't it?"
"8529690","8530050"," Yeah. "
"8530530","8532090"," Oh, this was the open."
"8533910","8534010"," Sorry."
"8534490","8534910"," Yeah. "
"8535490","8540830"," This is the open why I said, you know, I started to go long and why did I go long"
"8540830","8544010"," because I was, we were trading in a discount."
"8544370","8547790"," I think we were below the previous day equilibrium of yesterday."
"8548310","8548730"," Yeah. "
"8548790","8551770"," We're training a discount that was as soon as that three third 30 hour hit yesterday."
"8551770","8554570"," I was like, we're going to rock this shit right up to the top here in the close."
"8554650","8554850"," Yeah. "
"8556310","8561410"," It's like, for me, you know, anything below the mid from yesterday is for me when they opened up"
"8561410","8562950"," like that and they sell down London."
"8562950","8563330"," Yeah."
"8564810","8566010"," And they press it down like that. "
"8566310","8570790"," I automatically buy because, look, yesterday, London was in an premium for me."
"8571110","8571850"," So I short it."
"8572610","8575950"," And this is the setup that I look for in London, for example. "
"8576710","8582850"," And why I go short because like, I had a specific level that I was waiting for to happen and"
"8582850","8586250"," remember that new day opening gap that I drew for today."
"8586690","8587810"," This is the one from yesterday."
"8589030","8591990"," So you see the last thing and the first thing we have that. "
"8592550","8597450"," And I was expecting London to open up in the cash and to trade up in that level."
"8598270","8604590"," And next to that, you know, for me, this is my resistance zone, for example, that I'm keeping track"
"8604590","8604990"," of."
"8605330","8609210"," It's very simple because like, you know, you see these candles without any wits and untested. "
"8609970","8611410"," They will go back and retest it."
"8611550","8614310"," So they either reject the mid of it or the lower part of it."
"8614930","8616150"," So when we get there. "
"8616990","8622790"," I see this, you know, this is, this is like algorithmic pushing it up, you know, and trying to get"
"8622790","8625590"," like a higher short to sell a market down."
"8626310","8630950"," And the only thing I do, and this looks bullish as fuck when you see it, because like a lot"
"8630950","8634050"," of people think, Oh, fuck, now we're going to go back to that high."
"8634810","8639890"," Well, you know, in my mind, I was not looking for that at all because I had a bear's bias"
"8639890","8645110"," because I thought we were going to retest these equal lows on this side, for example. "
"8645110","8650650"," You know, in this consolidation part, because we had already done this."
"8652670","8658430"," And I wanted it to trade back into a discount to scoop up longs to go back up."
"8659870","8665190"," So, and, you know, and I love the five-minute chart because it's crystal clear. "
"8665670","8668610"," And yesterday it was, and like today we have a lot of fuckery happening."
"8669050","8671310"," So, but here you have that bullish for a value gap."
"8671310","8679310"," And the only thing I'm waiting for is you see this five-minute red candle here, the big one pointed"
"8679310","8679570"," out. "
"8679870","8687670"," This one, the minute it closes below this green box that I draw, I'm in short mode."
"8688130","8693110"," And the only thing I do is cook for shorts and look for shorts and start accumulating short, short,"
"8693110","8693670"," short shorts."
"8693670","8695530"," I put my stop right here. "
"8695830","8697190"," You know, you don't have to take much risk."
"8697710","8699010"," And where do I target to?"
"8699490","8700350"," Are these lows here?"
"8703340","8704480"," This right here."
"8707280","8713160"," And you have, you have time to add because like once you know and you have to find that you're"
"8713160","8718880"," going into a specific direction, you have time to enter it and the market gives you loves giving"
"8718880","8719800"," you second chances. "
"8720260","8725640"," And you can keep getting in, keep getting in, and then, you know, you can add to your position."
"8726180","8727380"," And where do you go to?"
"8728080","8732200"," The discount area, which was another gap from the day price."
"8732220","8733200"," Yeah, right down there. "
"8733340","8733580"," It's beautiful."
"8734380","8734820"," Yeah."
"8735200","8739680"," So, and then when we touch that, okay, we get to that low. "
"8740560","8745860"," And, you know, I'm looking, these zones are so important for me because what I'm looking for is"
"8745860","8747700"," these big candles right here, right?"
"8748460","8749400"," And I'm waiting."
"8749940","8753920"," I'm just waiting for the first five minutes to break above it."
"8754960","8760300"," And then go back down and it like for for me, you know, and that's another thing because like this"
"8760300","8762640"," is like for me an order block, this one here. "
"8763600","8767540"," So if we hold the mid of it, for example, it's a long."
"8767900","8773280"," So I start scooting lungs because if you go in a one minute chart, you can see this pattern"
"8773280","8775940"," evolving in the same way."
"8775940","8782180"," And it's like a mini W that is happening, you know, so let's zoom in. "
"8783400","8788380"," And then next to that, we had a silver bullet, which is going to be inverted, which was going to"
"8788380","8793040"," be used for me as a place to go along from."
"8793800","8797840"," And of course, they screwed it down, but, you know, that's part of training."
"8798160","8798340"," It sucks. "
"8798340","8800580"," You have to take some risk."
"8800780","8802660"," If you don't, you're never going to make money."
"8803820","8805920"," My risk is defined right here in this box. "
"8806460","8810220"," And I can, you know, put my stop right here."
"8811800","8812560"," Very short."
"8812880","8818560"," And I'm only talking about like a five point stop and start accumulating the lungs from this part"
"8818560","8818780"," here. "
"8819460","8820820"," The minute it breaks above."
"8821760","8828800"," This was my ad at this point here, because this is for me, like the second stage accumulation,"
"8829800","8832780"," where they can clean you up and where is my primary target."
"8834640","8839400"," What they are right up in there, right up in there, and this is the perfect you to swing. "
"8840720","8846260"," And the Judas is the trap where they get everyone short and they rip your face off and then, you"
"8846260","8847740"," know, and look where we are now."
"8848680","8852260"," So, and they keep, they keep doing that every single day."
"8852620","8853300"," It's the same pattern. "
"8853580","8854780"," It's the same game, almost."
"8855380","8864580"," So, and for me, this morning with the law, with like the lungs, like, like I said, every Asian"
"8864580","8865280"," session range."
"8866400","8867560"," I drop my standard deviations. "
"8868600","8873120"," And usually typically they make a high at the one standard deviation."
"8874000","8878560"," Or either a low at the one standard deviation, where you can take the other side of the trade."
"8880240","8883120"," Now, for today, you're going to see some weird shit. "
"8883360","8883620"," I don't know."
"8883740","8884780"," To be honest, I don't know."
"8884840","8887700"," I'm not expecting much because everything we know today. "
"8888720","8890060"," Is priced in right?"
"8890420","8893780"," Yeah, that's so we've had some people on the show, man, ask some."
"8894080","8896760"," I thought some very insightful questions."
"8896760","8899160"," They said, man, this looks like a."
"8901120","8901900"," Like a no. "
"8902780","8905920"," You know, sometimes you have a fed meat and we're priced it in, right?"
"8906620","8908040"," And it becomes like a."
"8908740","8912980"," You might get a for a rip or a dip in a rip, but it is no continuation that the."
"8914400","8916080"," You know, this gets kind of a done."
"8916980","8917420"," Yeah. "
"8919040","8925300"," Yeah, so that's my question here is, and you already said, you don't trade normally trade these US"
"8925300","8926140"," events, right?"
"8926140","8931820"," You just know, like a normal day of trading rather than, I don't know, a Senate hearing or a Fed"
"8931820","8933240"," rate decision, that kind of stuff."
"8933920","8934560"," I don't."
"8934700","8937700"," Yeah, I usually wait to see what happens after. "
"8937820","8943520"," I'm not going to be holding a position for it unless I, you know, I, in the past, I've traded"
"8943520","8944280"," this stuff."
"8944280","8952360"," And I've had a NASDAQ, like 150 point candle going down in the right direction on a single"
"8952360","8955940"," contract, but I've also had it gone the opposite direction where I had it wrong."
"8956600","8957980"," Yeah, I can't. "
"8958240","8959840"," These days for me, same thing."
"8960000","8961920"," And like, it's, it's a lot of trade, right?"
"8962280","8962800"," That's all it is."
"8962960","8968460"," Yeah, and the thing is, you know, whoever's showing you all this shit on the internet where you're"
"8968460","8971100"," getting filled with bullshit because you don't get filled. "
"8971100","8978140"," Like, you know, I've tried it myself where, you know, I'm in a position and like, and sometimes,"
"8978140","8982560"," unless they, you know, it starts consolidating and the volume has picked up a little bit, then you"
"8982560","8983480"," can initiate it."
"8984020","8990860"," But like, sometimes it takes like 20 seconds to get filled and there's nothing worse that in that"
"8990860","8992400"," 20 seconds so much can happen."
"8993480","9000480"," So I was complaining about, I'm not going to say them for today, but they were like, we were not"
"9000480","9001480"," doing our order flow. "
"9001640","9008640"," And I'm like, yes, you're watching getting no fills on fucking spy right now for pennies, right?"
"9008860","9014060"," And then chasing chasing you and then eventually I finally catch up and you do the fill right"
"9014060","9014800"," before the top."
"9015120","9018000"," And, you know, I'm just like, I'm not fucking playing this game with you guys today."
"9018640","9022660"," Well, you know, it's the most liquid fucking product in the stock market, right?"
"9023320","9026040"," Yeah, and, you know, and that sucks about trading in London. "
"9026520","9030680"," If you're trading more than like five contracts or something like that."
"9031260","9034760"," And you put your stop and you don't manage your stop supporting me."
"9034880","9038280"," So, look, I don't work with stops, right?"
"9038580","9044080"," And the reason is because I, I prefer to just press the button. "
"9044080","9049640"," It's a risk I'm willing to take for myself because I've lost so much money in the past and even"
"9049640","9055320"," last week, you know, I get still 20 points above or below wherever I have my stop place."
"9055640","9057640"," If you have it linked on the market order."
"9059500","9061620"," The liquidity is really thin. "
"9061880","9066180"," There's only like maybe four or five contracts on the book per price level approximately."
"9067140","9070440"," So let's say, for example, I went long here."
"9070440","9074600"," But options, will you ever use the markets to get out if you need to, if you're like, we're"
"9074600","9081780"," blasting up or something like that, or you're in a market orders or say again. "
"9082540","9089840"," I always use limit orders because that's why I never get like the top maximum that is possible"
"9089840","9094220"," because the spread sometimes are even a buck or something like that."
"9094740","9098040"," And like, and that's why I don't like trading options."
"9099040","9100760"," It's like, look, I don't try to spy. "
"9101220","9107540"," And the reason why I don't is because I have no, it's the overnight that happens where all the"
"9107540","9108520"," action happens to me."
"9108720","9108720"," Right."
"9109140","9111900"," So it's like you can't do anything with it. "
"9112440","9119300"," Like, even now I took a spy, but as a lot of thing, you know, like, I only spent like"
"9119300","9123700"," 200 bucks on it, but it's something I'm, you know, a risk I'm willing to take on it in that"
"9123700","9123940"," sense."
"9125920","9134160"," But I also wanted to see how, how do I get out of this position or get the bill on"
"9134160","9135600"," those things and it's just."
"9135920","9137860"," I usually try to rein in my expectations. "
"9137920","9142140"," If I think like, let's say I think a 10 cent calls going to a dollar."
"9143060","9146780"," I'll set a sell stop on it at 80 cents, 90 cents."
"9147020","9152640"," And I do miss out on profit sometimes, but my bills have become atrocious. "
"9152640","9155820"," Trying to hand buy and hand sell."
"9156600","9161440"," There were some rules that came out recently that may be impacting that."
"9161920","9169680"," But I've noticed that my fills on both sides of the trades are more dog shit than they've ever been"
"9169680","9171240"," in the previous time. "
"9171620","9176800"," I think it's I think it's intentional personally."
"9178200","9179540"," And look, the thing."
"9179580","9182640"," Okay, come play zero dates and we're going to fuck you over no matter what. "
"9182900","9184180"," We know you're here playing them."
"9184560","9186020"," So we're just not going to get your fills."
"9186760","9187800"," It's that simple. "
"9188060","9190720"," Really, I really, truly believe that it's that simple."
"9191480","9191960"," Yeah."
"9192940","9196540"," And if this is a recent thing, this isn't something that's been going on for years. "
"9196880","9197700"," It's been like the last."
"9198980","9203920"," It's really glaring, maybe the last three months, maybe six months."
"9204940","9211040"," I want to tirade about this and some people out there were like, you know, delete this shit. "
"9211260","9211580"," Fuck you."
"9211780","9212080"," You're wrong."
"9212260","9214100"," And I'm like, dude, I've been trading this shit for years. "
"9214560","9216480"," Never had a problem until recently."
"9217640","9218040"," Yeah."
"9219360","9223700"," And I think it's because, well, there was some, there were some rule changes that came out. "
"9224100","9225600"," I have to go find them, but there were some."
"9226580","9228160"," Some rule changes that came out."
"9228480","9232780"," And I think it's the, I think it's the people selling the, or the order flow people. "
"9232920","9234540"," I think that's what it is, but I'm not positive."
"9235940","9239960"," So, hey, we're going to go out and have a zero day party and all these retailers are on it."
"9240080","9242740"," So we'll just fucking do is not film on the way up, making chase. "
"9243540","9246900"," And then, and then not give the fills to close as well."
"9247480","9250120"," This is a, this is above bid to ask all that shit, right?"
"9250240","9251500"," I'll make a couple of things actually."
"9251640","9252120"," It doesn't matter. "
"9252200","9252720"," I don't get the fill."
"9253560","9253960"," Yeah."
"9254280","9254960"," And then comes the role. "
"9255160","9257740"," You got to be really fucking fast right now, I think, personally."
"9258400","9259980"," No, this isn't prime banks."
"9260140","9267440"," And the thing is, you know, with futures, I'm able to execute just, you know, with a press of a"
"9267440","9270180"," mouse click, you know, to give you an idea. "
"9270640","9272780"," They have friends with prime banks saying they're not encountering this."
"9272940","9276100"," Like if you're trading with Schwab or someone like that, they've had better fills."
"9277700","9280680"," No, well, yeah, I have no complaints with interactive brokers. "
"9281060","9288520"," You know, the thing is those market order fills that I get 20 points above or below is because"
"9288520","9289720"," they're market orders."
"9290540","9292280"," And, you know, the book is really thin."
"9292780","9297800"," If you look on my book map now that I have here, you can see each order on each price"
"9297800","9298180"," level. "
"9299040","9299740"," Right here."
"9299980","9301900"," So you see 32 contracts are here."
"9302240","9305860"," But the problem is, let's go back onto the chart. "
"9306720","9310300"," You see when they have these jumps, these fair value gaps that get created."
"9311160","9313760"," Let me put on the tool so you're able to see them."
"9314980","9317080"," I mean, these are things where price jumps. "
"9317800","9319560"," Now let's go to a 15 second chart."
"9320360","9324020"," Now it's okay, because we're an RTH, the book is sticker."
"9324820","9325840"," Let's go back to London. "
"9326560","9330960"," And you, the only thing you'll see is gaps, vacuums, vacuums everywhere."
"9332320","9341780"," So, and that is, that is the problem because if you work with your stops in London, and like London"
"9341780","9342680"," hasn't opened yet."
"9346340","9350060"," You see all these gaps, you see, you know, the chart gets cluttered. "
"9351060","9357400"," This is a good indicator for me to see that there's a lot of gaps in between."
"9358220","9363580"," But I also use them to my advantage, because like if these gaps get left behind, I know they will"
"9363580","9365460"," go back and fill and refill them."
"9365820","9367520"," So, you know, all gaps get filled. "
"9368140","9369580"," And that is where the saying comes from."
"9370280","9375900"," Because this is where price has jumped a specific price level and they need to refill those orders"
"9375900","9378160"," at a later stage during the day."
"9378160","9385700"," So, I like it when they leave these big gaps open, for example, because they will go back. "
"9385860","9387160"," You know that they come back for them."
"9387700","9389520"," Yeah, so I trade towards them."
"9389860","9393000"," I use them as my exits, for example. "
"9393960","9398980"," Now, when RTH opens up, the book is a bit thicker, so you don't see them as much, but you"
"9398980","9404520"," do see them in consolidations, but you can see in those consolidations we go back and recheck them"
"9404520","9405380"," many times."
"9405380","9407740"," So, which is perfectly fine."
"9410240","9416260"," Now, you see, the thing is, I showed you just now that five minute per value gap right that I"
"9416260","9420160"," extended all the way from London this morning, which was at 430. "
"9421260","9425520"," And notice how that is my support level for the entire day already."
"9426900","9428680"," Now, let's go back to book map."
"9429080","9430580"," How am I utilizing this thing?"
"9431060","9433360"," You know, I was late during the party. "
"9434160","9438880"," But to give you an idea what happened is, is we have that midnight open, which was touched here."
"9441820","9442540"," Right here."
"9442900","9445220"," You see, I'm going to do open my drawing tool. "
"9445620","9448120"," Like, typically I would, I would close my long hair right now."
"9448600","9454500"," Because I see we're being absorbed and this is an area where I typically will short it back down."
"9454840","9455080"," Yeah. "
"9455880","9457120"," So I'm looking for."
"9457120","9463220"," Yeah, but I'm going to show you why I can't do that because I'm long and because, like, on the"
"9463220","9467740"," higher time frame, I still have my target that we're going to go up here in this zone here."
"9468320","9471300"," And I still have one contract on, but I'm skilled out. "
"9471640","9479740"," So, what did I do to be able to give myself that room, because this is my average, according to"
"9479740","9483240"," my broker, but in my head, my average is right here on the Asia low."
"9483240","9491740"," So what I do is, once I see that we've held this area here, and that happened at the open,"
"9492000","9498320"," I think, they scooted it down to the midnight open, they held it to the tick right here."
"9499440","9500960"," See, this is the low. "
"9501340","9506580"," That was 945 approximately, which is the midnight open."
"9508620","9511360"," See, they held it scooted back up."
"9511680","9513760"," Okay, this is a short, you can short it back down. "
"9514000","9519980"," Typically, you would think we need to go down here, but there's a, you know, we have that fair"
"9519980","9522180"," value gap that I showed you this one here."
"9522620","9527380"," Notice we're wicking in it, but we're not getting any bodies closures below it."
"9527680","9527780"," Right. "
"9528180","9530420"," So I'm still in my head long."
"9531540","9535420"," I'm not going to change it until, you know, they break down on it."
"9536240","9538560"," Or they, you know, they close a five minute candle. "
"9539760","9541000"," Are you looking for that today?"
"9541140","9545520"," Like, I'm looking, I'm hoping that two o'clock or something and get a nice quick rip down there."
"9546920","9549300"," Well, yeah, you know, London's closing in 20 minutes."
"9549360","9553040"," So, you know, it's, I don't know what, what they're going to do. "
"9553120","9554880"," They're going to do a run, a run on liquidity."
"9554880","9561780"," You know, if they're going to go up, maybe that's a sign for me to get out because, but like,"
"9561980","9564600"," you know, there's another thing that I keep track of is the CVD."
"9565340","9567440"," And there's just no bearishness in there. "
"9567680","9569560"," So smart money is not doing it."
"9569660","9575640"," So I'm just expecting chop, you know, and I'm trading the ranges and I have a bullish bias because"
"9575640","9579220"," I think we are still going to retest those eyes at some point."
"9580320","9586920"," So, but, you know, whatever happened, you know, the thing is, is that like I enter my trades and I"
"9586920","9589860"," buy these five contracts right here, you see. "
"9592060","9599160"," And the first push up, I take them off, four of them, because I'm not putting much risk on at"
"9599160","9599520"," the moment."
"9600160","9606040"," And what that does, it reduces my average where I'm basically long from the age of low."
"9606920","9610280"," Because I like to trade those Asia low and Asia high ranges. "
"9610980","9612940"," Now, there's a thing here."
"9613520","9616740"," We are, you know, they keep scooting us above the Asian high."
"9617780","9620620"," And the previous day high is also being tested. "
"9621140","9624460"," I would prefer them to do something like this and trade up to it."
"9625240","9627740"," But, you know, since we're undersized."
"9628580","9631860"," Yeah, that's a function of today, right, to some extent, too. "
"9632800","9638800"," Yeah, but like I said, you know, like typically what if what I see happening here at the moment."
"9639400","9646040"," I like if I'm scalping, I would short it down to here, you know, and but, you know, my average"
"9646040","9646400"," is here."
"9646520","9651240"," So I have nothing to lose and I'm just waiting to see what is happening. "
"9651240","9658600"," And I can always eject and join the party to go down to what I showed you earlier, where I"
"9658600","9660280"," was hoping to scoot up some lungs here."
"9661580","9665680"," Let me see if you guys have any questions right now for David."
"9666880","9670280"," They make this larger so we can see what they're asking here. "
"9671040","9677680"," Because I, you know, I really want to see something happening in this area here, you know, and then"
"9677680","9678880"," I'll put on some bigger size."
"9678880","9680720"," And what I'm looking for is a flush down."
"9681000","9682240"," Yeah, that's what I want right there. "
"9682640","9683940"," That's what I want right there."
"9684560","9690360"," And then go back up and then I'll buy the first bullet for a value gap that overlaps that previous"
"9690360","9691060"," bearish one."
"9691260","9695400"," And then I'll go along and where will I target to are these highs here. "
"9696300","9699700"," So, and if we go up here right now, you know, I'm out."
"9699960","9701320"," This is this is my exit."
"9702060","9702880"," No matter what. "
"9703620","9705360"," That's how I felt this morning on the open."
"9705360","9709800"," So I said, when we opened up this one, I was like, yeah, what room is there to trade here?"
"9709940","9712260"," Like, we're not going to for, we're not going to 520."
"9713720","9716760"," On no news, I guess, or unless they front run it. "
"9716860","9721720"," But even if they do front run it up there, I've got no catalyst for it."
"9722440","9724120"," So I'm not going to take that trade."
"9724980","9731240"," And like, we're locked in this range, you know, so you have to take, you have to take what you"
"9731240","9731540"," can get. "
"9731980","9734480"," What is high probable for me to trade?"
"9735280","9741060"," And that is why I use those standard deviations because like, you know, typically a high or a low"
"9741060","9746700"," of the session is made at the one standard deviation unless a new catalyst pushes it further, which"
"9746700","9753820"," is perfectly fine, you know, but then you need to wait for confirmations for it to, to, you know,"
"9753940","9755220"," to continue back up."
"9755700","9757580"," Now, why did it reject here?"
"9757680","9760060"," There was also a bearish for a value gap."
"9760340","9765360"," You see this high here that was here, you know, if I pull this over. "
"9765960","9769080"," So this was an area of resistance for me already."
"9769080","9775940"," In that sense, and if we trade into it, and the minute, you know, the candles, they close back"
"9775940","9778540"," underneath it, and they can wick through it."
"9778840","9783300"," But, you know, notice that there is no body, a candle closure is above it anymore. "
"9783900","9785420"," And, you know, they trap them."
"9785840","9789060"," So it's, yeah, it's, it's messy."
"9789560","9795080"," It's not as clean as it should for me to typically take these traits, but like. "
"9795080","9800500"," It requires you to wait because like a lot of times they will go back and retest it like an"
"9800500","9802320"," hour or a few hours later."
"9803120","9810540"," Now comes the other element to it, right, because like you always hear me talking about the four"
"9810540","9815240"," hour opens and I like to operate from specific key times."
"9816420","9823400"," And those basically every four hour candle opening that occurs because it's when the market starts"
"9823400","9824640"," setting up the trap. "
"9825080","9828500"," So, and they happen every single day at the same times."
"9829040","9833420"," So let me take everything off here for a minute and I'll show you what I mean with this."
"9835240","9838460"," Let's go to this chart here because it's real clean. "
"9842440","9847800"," Well, today it's messy because we're in consolidation, but let's go back to yesterday."
"9851480","9854580"," It's tough to it's like days like today, man."
"9854740","9855600"," I don't like. "
"9857420","9861940"," It's like one of the worst days or days like today where I'm like, I'm going to come on show"
"9861940","9862640"," the show today."
"9862860","9866080"," How do I set something up for somebody when anything can happen?"
"9866520","9871860"," You can't, you know, that's except that which is okay because, you know, you."
"9872780","9875600"," These days are it's a coin flip, right?"
"9875600","9876960"," Yeah, that's like an ER, man. "
"9877120","9878400"," It's like, yeah."
"9879120","9881320"," What am I doing sitting here trying to trade the ER?"
"9881640","9884880"," So I'll trade the run up."
"9885020","9886220"," I'll trade the after. "
"9886440","9890300"," I'll trade the reaction, but I don't, not particularly keen on."
"9892720","9896160"," I think I think days like today are the reaction trade."
"9897740","9898620"," Yeah, 100%. "
"9899500","9900840"," Not that I'm going to take a coin."
"9900940","9904680"," I guess you could do the coin flip too, but it's still as long as you know, that's a lottery."
"9905080","9909680"," The only, the only sure thing I know is I know where buyers are and where sellers are. "
"9910160","9914100"," And if we can go to either of those places, I can usually buy or sell."
"9916000","9921940"," Yeah, and I guess you could call those four hour openings that I'm talking about like POCs, right?"
"9922380","9922420"," Yeah."
"9925800","9931220"," Basically, they trap you around that level and it's your job to figure out if they're either"
"9931220","9935360"," accumulating or distributing below or above that level, right?"
"9936360","9941540"," So a lot of times it depends on the type of day and what the previous session has done. "
"9942380","9949960"," And if we're in a discount, for example, let's say we have London right here, right?"
"9950760","9953400"," It's at 2 a.m. The open starts."
"9954720","9958200"," You see, you notice how they're accumulating above and then scooting it up."
"9959760","9966580"," And typically, for me, at 5 a.m., is when the trap is set and that's when the liquidity, you"
"9966580","9974760"," know, gets out of the system and then they start preparing to move it down for the RTH and the"
"9974760","9977520"," normal, let's say, 6 a.m. open. "
"9978220","9984280"," So the times where I like to initiate a trade is either at 1 a.m. 2 a.m., at"
"9984280","9989980"," 6 a.m., New York time, and at 10 a.m., and at 2 p.m., that's it."
"9990620","9994580"," The rest, I could care less about what happens in between because most of the time I'm just joining"
"9994580","9995600"," the party to where it is."
"9995780","9998600"," Now, today, forget about today because you can't. "
"9998820","9999720"," We have FOMC."
"10001100","10002840"," So let's review what happened yesterday."
"10003560","10011200"," So, look, they are accumulating below here and in the end, when the cash opens up in London, they"
"10011200","10014960"," screwed it up and they whip it up here. "
"10015680","10022820"," But the only thing they really did is they were accumulating shorts from this area here because"
"10022820","10028680"," notice that they are start stepping down already the previous sessions."
"10029540","10033680"," So they're creating in my head, the trap to make a continuation moves down."
"10035540","10037260"," Then 6 a.m. opens up. "
"10037480","10038600"," It's the next four hour candle."
"10038960","10043800"," The first move, a lot of times, is the fake one, especially the one at 6 a.m. and at"
"10043800","10049620"," 2 p.m. So they go out and everyone thinks, oh, we help support."
"10049820","10050280"," We're going to go. "
"10050600","10051680"," No, well, they're not."
"10051940","10053160"," They're actually dumping it down."
"10054460","10059780"," Then comes the next one at 10 a.m. And that's why I do not trade the open because I"
"10059780","10064680"," just, I want the market to show its hand to tell me what it's going to do. "
"10064760","10066200"," And they will tell you what to do."
"10066440","10070500"," And that's why I look for those plays on those third value gaps to either go up."
"10070500","10079380"," Let me ask you, I just pulled up a chart here where, you know, Scott Ball was he brings up"
"10079380","10081220"," that there's a vol control. "
"10082820","10088380"," He calls it the, he calls it the like a vol control that comes into the market at 10 a "
"10088380","10092520",".m. 130 in the afternoon and 330 p "
"10092520","10102160",".m. 130 and 130"
"10102160","10105840"," and then 330 in the afternoon."
"10106060","10107480"," Have you noticed any of that happening or no?"
"10107980","10108560"," Oh, yeah."
"10108760","10110420"," But like I have my own setup for that. "
"10110820","10118040"," Look, I have my golden nuggets, which is based on algos, where I take, you know, I either join the"
"10118040","10120560"," trend or do the opposite part of it, right?"
"10121140","10124900"," And that window starts at 11 o'clock, New York time usually."
"10125900","10128000"," But I like to take the trade at noon."
"10128440","10129140"," It's a lunch trade. "
"10130120","10134880"," And, you know, after an hour and 30 minutes, you should be out unless your target has been reached"
"10134880","10140220"," because of the previous opening price of two o'clock has not been tested that day yet."
"10140780","10142960"," It's a target where I'm going to work towards them."
"10144400","10149400"," So in this case, like, for example, here, you know, you have the New York a.m. session down here"
"10149400","10152580"," and look, we were trading in a discount here already. "
"10152580","10154780"," So that's why I was good for longs already."
"10155480","10160280"," And then, you know, the golden nugget is the one that pushes it through to that level for me."
"10161120","10162460"," And that happens every single day. "
"10163060","10168740"," So, you know, sometimes you will see the high or low of the day and even like the biggest low"
"10168740","10171180"," for like days on end."
"10172500","10177040"," Because, look, for example, this golden nugget here, which was on Friday last Friday."
"10178200","10180920"," That was look what happened the next week. "
"10181820","10187740"," I mean, I don't like to hold over the weekend, but, you know, you get these type of moves from"
"10187740","10188620"," it, you know."
"10189540","10192140"," But you can also get like the highs from it."
"10192400","10197660"," So, yeah, and sometimes it's just in range if we're in consolidation, which is fine. "
"10199320","10202260"," But you get these here."
"10202520","10203740"," This is before daylight saving."
"10203980","10205040"," So the time is not right. "
"10205400","10207620"," The times are not correct on the chart."
"10208220","10211920"," So if you're if you're watching the show right now, we've got a bunch of questions coming in."
"10211960","10213500"," I can see what some of you guys are saying here. "
"10215200","10219500"," You may, if you want to learn more, number one, if you want to learn more about this, David is"
"10219500","10220080"," in our discord."
"10220080","10224320"," He discusses this every day in our discord."
"10224660","10225140"," If you are. "
"10225200","10227660"," So Scott, I'm just going to bring this over."
"10228520","10232280"," So this comes from a ball was going to briefly put this here, David, just for a moment."
"10233440","10237740"," Now this isn't to say that this is every day. "
"10239440","10244760"," But if we are trading down into the 10 a.m. hour, you're going to be looking for buyers to"
"10244760","10245440"," step in there."
"10245640","10248820"," Same thing if we trade down into the one one 30 p.m. hour."
"10249680","10254960"," And then the same thing if we trade down into the three 30 p.m. hour that you're looking for"
"10254960","10260500"," buyers to step in around 10 a.m. I think if this is one p.m. he may have written"
"10260500","10263300"," one 30, but right around that one p.m. hour every day. "
"10263480","10265020"," Now that doesn't mean this is every day."
"10266640","10269480"," If you guys want to see if you guys want to take a snap of this or something."
"10269660","10270540"," Oh, hold on a second here. "
"10271780","10272820"," Clear all this out."
"10274280","10276440"," If you guys want to take a quick snap of that at home."
"10277520","10281380"," Now, you know, if price is going up, up, up, you're not going to be able to trade this, but"
"10281380","10283120"," if you see the market coming down. "
"10283920","10288240"," Into some fair value stuff at 10 a.m. one p.m. and three 30."
"10288640","10292220"," You should be looking for those buyers to step in."
"10293200","10294200"," I continue on. "
"10294320","10294860"," Sorry about that, brother."
"10295260","10298200"," We've got questions here for you, David, two, a whole bunch of questions."
"10300020","10300940"," Can you read me?"
"10301080","10301640"," I can't read. "
"10301820","10302660"," I'll read some to you."
"10303000","10309040"," Do you think using Asian markets to predict us markets is a bit of a tail wagging the dog?"
"10309040","10311360"," I mean, if I guess if it works, it works."
"10311620","10315180"," You know, there's another thing here, too, that David hasn't brought up, which is. "
"10315900","10321340"," Which he has in the past, of course, but you got to remember about market or dealers out there."
"10322000","10328020"," When they have to chase price and then when they try to become delta neutral again in different"
"10328020","10330000"," market openings and closings, right?"
"10330320","10332040"," What can they dump on the US open?"
"10332700","10333960"," Something they chase down on the overnight."
"10334220","10335420"," You guys have heard the term, right?"
"10335640","10337940"," Like you become the whole into a close. "
"10339040","10344660"," The US session closed at 4 p.m. And then surprise, surprise, they're offering those options."
"10344660","10350160"," Well, not options, but those contracts up to the Asian market and the London market."
"10350800","10353800"," And what where does price go into the US market open?"
"10355960","10361840"," So they're asking you, do you think Asian markets do you think using Asian markets to predict US"
"10361840","10362360"," markets?"
"10362980","10364780"," Is a bit of a tail wagging the dog?"
"10365020","10366400"," I mean, I guess if it works, it works. "
"10367260","10368740"," So what are your thoughts on that, David?"
"10369660","10372200"," You don't have to answer these questions, by the way."
"10372400","10376860"," Look, the thing is, is that Asia is always the one that is accumulating, right?"
"10377620","10380180"," And a lot of times say it again, say a lot or form."
"10381380","10386540"," Yeah, and a lot of times you will see a either a high or low in the London session for"
"10386540","10386920"," the day. "
"10387940","10390360"," And yeah, it's common, right?"
"10390500","10391840"," I don't know, call it what you want."
"10391840","10397280"," But the thing is, is that like what is predictable for me in the London session regarding the Asian"
"10397280","10405220"," session is that like when you do it, for example, these are algorithms, true, right?"
"10405380","10411120"," These algorithms are working on a clock on a calendar and you can see them literally like"
"10411120","10412280"," accumulating, distributing."
"10413240","10417000"," It's wild when you look at it, you know, from every session together. "
"10418440","10423640"," A lot of US people, a lot of US traders think like, oh, this is the stock market, right?"
"10423880","10427100"," 9.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. Yeah."
"10431100","10435960"," So you see, I'm doing a live paper trade now for you guys right now here."
"10436560","10438140"," How I like to sculpt them out. "
"10439080","10441500"," Like typically I would scale out here in this area here."
"10441740","10443500"," I only managed to get filled on one contract."
"10446690","10447590"," The amount already. "
"10448730","10452630"," They're asking you why you have different sized candles on your chart too."
"10453330","10457330"," Why do you have the multi time frame candles in the chart?"
"10457450","10459770"," You have smaller candles in the left and larger candles in the right."
"10460610","10463950"," Okay, the larger ones are the four hour candles that I have. "
"10464430","10470270"," I put them at 13 to show you the lines, but usually I only care about the last three like"
"10470270","10470470"," this."
"10471750","10478590"," And they are four hour candles because I'm in the belief of that the market, especially now in"
"10478590","10480130"," these type of situations here."
"10481270","10482650"," We're seeking liquidity. "
"10483430","10488210"," So if you don't know what the resistance is in the support is, then you are the liquidity"
"10488210","10489850"," basically, you know, so."
"10490670","10498330"," And what I look for is either the previous openings, the closes and the highs and the lows of these"
"10498330","10499070"," four hour candles."
"10499890","10502890"," And this is my scope, basically, where I trade in. "
"10503150","10508990"," And you're looking at what the range, the price range is in each candle where it's been traded the"
"10508990","10509530"," most, right?"
"10510110","10515130"," So, you know, in my head, like, you know, I already pointed out what, you know, my interest was in"
"10515130","10517070"," these levels down here, right?"
"10517410","10521230"," So let's continue to pull these boxes over."
"10521890","10524510"," And why did I take this long here just now?"
"10526840","10528580"," Okay, you see, I went long here."
"10528580","10532460"," I scooted it because we went down on that four hour opening. "
"10533220","10535360"," We got underneath it and started accumulating."
"10536060","10538600"," You know, I see this barcoding thing happening down there."
"10538780","10542100"," So for me in my head, it's already, okay, fuck, they're going to go back up. "
"10542980","10548220"," Whatever, you know, this is only a five point scalp, but it's practical because it happens on every"
"10548220","10548500"," time."
"10548660","10552260"," I'm trading a 50 second time frame chart right here in front of you, right?"
"10556300","10561680"," So, you know, I've learned this area, look, this is that box that I like."
"10561820","10563520"," I mean, I see what you're saying here. "
"10563840","10565520"," This to me is no risk."
"10565960","10570600"," Well, there's risk, but you know, not like the upside, you're already on the upside already."
"10570860","10574160"," We're like, we're going to do a breakthrough along right here at this resistance point. "
"10574460","10575640"," And I'm like, oh, do you like crazy?"
"10575960","10578680"," Like, wait till you get above it, at least they create that."
"10578680","10584720"," I could care less if they break down because like for me, like typically I would put on like four"
"10584720","10586160"," or five contracts on this."
"10586660","10592520"," And, you know, I wasn't able to press the button quick enough because I'm using a paper account on"
"10592520","10596180"," here, but like I'm typically on book map, I would like add here. "
"10596820","10601780"," And just, you know, press the button and then on this first push, I would take some off again."
"10601780","10609720"," And that difference of price points, I buy my stop basically, you know, but, you know, we could be"
"10609720","10615000"," in a downtrend with it or, you know, in an uptrend in a downtrend."
"10615160","10619180"," So, I'm a scalper. "
"10619320","10619640"," I'm not a."
"10619840","10620840"," Yeah, no, I'm the same way."
"10621020","10623540"," If you ask me what time frame run, I'll tell you more different things."
"10624300","10628120"," For me, if you're not able to get 50 bucks out, you're not going to be able to get a"
"10628120","10629160"," thousand bucks out of it. "
"10629420","10632940"," You know, so, you know, if I'm able to get the 50 bucks out, that's fine."
"10633660","10640580"," So, and, and just as an example, you know, I'm jumping from screen to screen here."
"10640580","10647680"," So, for me, it's difficult to really focus on like executing flawlessly in that sense. "
"10649320","10655400"," But you can see that I, the reason why I'm selling here is because this, there's this little"
"10655400","10656420"," inefficiency here."
"10657300","10658960"," Now, let's have a look here."
"10660580","10662640"," You see, you see this little gap here. "
"10663380","10663620"," Yeah."
"10664980","10666260"," On the 15 second chart."
"10666560","10666980"," Yeah, I see. "
"10667680","10668180"," Okay."
"10670550","10671510"," That will get filled."
"10672470","10673790"," It's not going to remain naked. "
"10675410","10676390"," At some point."
"10677250","10679430"," So, the deeper we go."
"10680590","10681330"," For me. "
"10682130","10685390"," That is already in my head where I'm content."
"10686810","10688130"," To take profits from."
"10688590","10691330"," So, let's plan ahead towards that gap. "
"10694240","10696140"," Let's forget about the stop for a minute."
"10696300","10696400"," Right."
"10699080","10700560"," Because we're not focusing on the entry. "
"10700760","10703560"," The first thing I'm, you know, where's my exit."
"10704160","10705740"," That is the first thing I'm focusing on."
"10706280","10707560"," Then the second part is. "
"10709380","10711640"," Where's my stop and where will I."
"10714360","10715160"," Enter in."
"10716020","10716540"," Hold on."
"10716700","10717040"," One second. "
"10718440","10718960"," Hold on."
"10719000","10720260"," My cat is yelling like a bitch."
"10720500","10722820"," I have to go down to give her some food to shut her up. "
"10723320","10723820"," Hold on."
"10739660","10743220"," So, watching a while David is taking care of his cat right now."
"10744000","10745440"," Taking a look at spoons. "
"10745680","10747900"," Not too much going on on S&P 500 right now."
"10747940","10753280"," Just grinding sideways awaiting the feds decision at 2 p.m. When we get closer to that 2 p.m."
"10753420","10755040"," hour, I'm going to switch the format here."
"10755700","10757120"," And what we'll do is we'll bring up. "
"10758020","10761560"," I'll bring up the fed or Jerome Powell's speech."
"10762560","10763340"," And then the Q&A."
"10763360","10764560"," You'll have that on one screener. "
"10764740","10767900"," The other screener will have, I believe S&P 500."
"10767900","10769980"," T&A or get DNA."
"10771680","10773480"," And I forget what the other one that I put up. "
"10773600","10776040"," Maybe Vix, I guess, or Dixie or something like that."
"10776240","10778480"," And then you'll also see the S."
"10779600","10783180"," I think I'll also, I think you usually put up the book map."
"10783440","10783820"," I'm not sure. "
"10784440","10788240"," So you'll see a format change as we get closer to the 2 p.m. hour right around 1 30"
"10788240","10788780"," this afternoon."
"10789320","10791060"," That's about one hour from now."
"10791700","10795820"," If you have any questions while David is gone, please feel free to ask them now. "
"10795820","10797540"," If I can get them to questions, I will."
"10798580","10799180"," I'm back."
"10801870","10802710"," Can you hear me?"
"10803190","10803810"," Yeah, they're called. "
"10804050","10804990"," So how do we can hear you?"
"10805170","10807830"," So what they're called a multi time frame."
"10808210","10810150"," Charts, not everybody offers them."
"10810330","10811890"," I think light speed offers them. "
"10812250","10816450"," You have to find specific brokers, brokers that focus on futures usually."
"10818130","10818570"," Yeah."
"10818890","10820090"," So you see what?"
"10820190","10820770"," Yeah, I think so. "
"10820890","10821490"," Be up to Jimmy."
"10822190","10822630"," Sorry."
"10822810","10823230"," Go ahead, David. "
"10823310","10823670"," I apologize."
"10824110","10825010"," Questions in the chat, brother."
"10825010","10829890"," So you see what is happening now already that they're trying to rebalance. "
"10830190","10834390"," There's an efficiency that is here that, you know, that I plan this trade for you."
"10834390","10836730"," So, okay, well, this is where I plan to go in."
"10836730","10837910"," And this is my stop. "
"10838890","10840930"," And we reached the target now already."
"10841350","10841910"," You see?"
"10842530","10842570"," Boom."
"10847930","10850290"," So you guys all watching this at home right now. "
"10853210","10853870"," Oh, yes."
"10854110","10856770"," Is the, is the trader podcast deep fake out today or no?"
"10857470","10859310"," I didn't, I didn't know if it was out or not."
"10859310","10860230"," Somebody couldn't link me to that. "
"10860250","10860890"," I appreciate it."
"10860930","10861810"," I put it up for you guys."
"10863030","10863390"," Okay. "
"10863530","10864750"," You see the target has been reached?"
"10865930","10866290"," Yeah."
"10866330","10866830"," It's perfect man."
"10866930","10867710"," It's a great fucking trade. "
"10868370","10873230"," I mean, this is the thing too is David was when we came into this week, we were telling people"
"10873230","10879610"," to stay on the extremes and not be trying to trade the one minutes in case we get these big"
"10879610","10882550"," massive drops to just buy these extremes."
"10882590","10884910"," And this is, this is working out perfectly right now, right?"
"10885970","10886330"," Yeah."
"10886470","10887550"," Well, you know, that's the problem. "
"10887550","10892810"," Because I know you're, you're trying to revert from the scalping and more to the swing thing."
"10893250","10897410"," But look, I'm, I'm, I'm showing you how to trade this."
"10897570","10899370"," Then now on a 15 second chart. "
"10899710","10900350"," Well, yeah."
"10900510","10906570"," Well, I think my point to them is that, um, if they're just hanging out in the middle, uh, there's,"
"10906650","10907710"," they could get hurt, right?"
"10907890","10909530"," There could be sudden drops in the market."
"10910010","10914670"," So even if you're portrayed in a 15 second or a week yesterday before we switched over from like 30"
"10914670","10918510"," minutes, they went out the one hour in the 30 minute down to the one minute, only when we're taking"
"10918510","10918870"," trades. "
"10919730","10923830"," But looking for those extremities and the bottoms on the tops to trade."
"10926070","10932930"," And that is zooming out, or zooming out a little bit, I guess, or, uh, not being so focused on"
"10932930","10937210"," the one minute chart or 15 second chart or whatever."
"10937890","10941410"," Uh, for where are where we're actually, are we right now?"
"10942130","10942590"," Yeah. "
"10942590","10946770"," And, you know, and this is the messy part of it though, in that sense."
"10947070","10952870"," Like, you know, over time when you get confident and, and, and finding these type of setups, the"
"10952870","10956910"," way I'm looking for them, um, I put on some more size."
"10957290","10962210"," So like, let's say, you know, I, I trade between three to 10. "
"10962430","10965030"," Sometimes that's the max that I do."
"10965730","10971370"," But on this trade for me, you know, that's already like $2,000 on an eight lot."
"10971370","10973330"," Or with eight contracts, for example. "
"10974230","10983710"," Um, and like when the market is predictable in a range, I, I, you know, I have my stop in"
"10983710","10986110"," place and on these swing lows, but."
"10987010","10991870"," I don't care if they continue up to, even though my bias is that they will go up."
"10992110","10994270"," You know, it's a different type of trade for me. "
"10994910","10999370"," Um, I extract what I need to extract for that day, for example."
"11000070","11005270"," And if you're able to identify three of these things per day."
"11006030","11007990"," And they happen a hundred times a day. "
"11008930","11014150"," And, and you train yourself on that specific setup and not be jumping from one type of."
"11014990","11016850"," You know, style of trading to the other."
"11017770","11021370"," Um, you know, you don't need anything else. "
"11021870","11023210"," You could care less what they do."
"11023890","11027610"," Because you, you've already pulled what you needed to pull out of the market with this track."
"11027610","11034550"," And that is the problem that I had in the beginning is that I was flip-flopping strategies all the"
"11034550","11034850"," time. "
"11035770","11038450"," And at a specific time, I started to."
"11039530","11044630"," Just trade these reversal setups, you know, when everyone thinks we're going to go down."
"11045390","11047010"," To take the opposite side of the trade. "
"11048190","11050150"," So for me to go short again."
"11051210","11053030"," I'm, I'm not thinking of going short."
"11053030","11059970"," At least until we reach towards this level here or here or even higher because. "
"11060870","11064930"," And what I'm going to be looking for is these reversal setups to go back down."
"11065070","11070170"," Now, I showed you this little inefficiency on here, right on that chart."
"11071110","11075990"," But look, I also know they're going to go back down at some points because look, we have. "
"11075990","11078030"," Yeah, there's one right there."
"11078030","11083290"," So, and that is why I'm certain that we're going to go there at some point, but how high can"
"11083290","11083650"," they go?"
"11084110","11089830"," Well, you know, like I said, in my open trade that I still have here, I'm still long, you know,"
"11090230","11092230"," for higher right here."
"11093270","11095030"," So I'm still holding that same runner. "
"11095390","11101450"," I'm letting it do its thing because like, that is sort of like the swing trade that I'm doing where"
"11101450","11104770"," I think, you know, we're going to get a push up at some points."
"11106350","11111810"," Now, I take into account time of day and those kinds of things because London closes is happening"
"11111810","11112150"," now."
"11112930","11117950"," And so, you know, the elbows got turned on and they're going to start selling them and distributing"
"11117950","11118670"," them again. "
"11119430","11124910"," And like I said, also my bias is bullish because I'm looking at the cumulative volume delta."
"11125570","11129270"," It's not showing any weakness so far for the entire day."
"11129270","11130710"," I had a question for you. "
"11130770","11136930"," People are asking, how do you do the four hour candle overlay on your trading view chart?"
"11139610","11140490"," Let me see."
"11140630","11142970"," There is a indicator called."
"11144650","11146810"," It's called TTM HDF. "
"11148830","11149430"," TTM."
"11150370","11150970"," Yeah."
"11151230","11152470"," HTF is the indicator. "
"11153350","11154830"," Yeah, it's this one."
"11158630","11159810"," I have a paid one."
"11160950","11163510"," But it's okay, but this is the one that you should have. "
"11163750","11164050"," It's free."
"11164330","11166170"," It's the same thing that I have for the paid one."
"11167410","11168290"," TTM HTT. "
"11168550","11169790"," What else does it say there?"
"11169930","11170410"," I can't read it."
"11171410","11172290"," TTM HTF."
"11172890","11175430"," I have a time frame candle overlay power of three. "
"11175710","11176950"," It's from the tick magnet."
"11178490","11179970"," You guys catch that out there."
"11185180","11187280"," Thank you, aces 10 posting that. "
"11189040","11189480"," Yeah."
"11189480","11191140"," And you have some other ones also."
"11191460","11192420"," There's three or four. "
"11192540","11193820"," You need to look in the indicator list."
"11193980","11194740"," I'm trading to you."
"11196320","11201380"," You see, but like it doesn't look, you can slap it on, but you need to know how to use"
"11201380","11202580"," it, you know, so. "
"11203820","11207520"," I just posted in the YouTube chat for you if you're watching on YouTube."
"11210720","11212220"," I fucking love this show, David."
"11212300","11212980"," I'm sorry, man. "
"11213320","11214420"," This show is so awesome."
"11214420","11216780"," Like the stuff that we do here is so cool."
"11216960","11218240"," I appreciate you being here, brother. "
"11218380","11219180"," It's funny to let you know that."
"11219400","11220300"," Yeah, no worries."
"11221380","11228760"," So, you know, and now comes the point again where the fractal part of it is of the higher time"
"11228760","11235560"," frame story of that is being told for me, in my opinion, is that we should trade up to these"
"11235560","11236860"," equal highs up here, right?"
"11238620","11244220"," So, on the higher time frame, I like when they leave highs like this, I guess you could call them"
"11244220","11246320"," poor highs or something like that or whatever. "
"11248120","11250660"," But I like to use the mass target a lot of times."
"11253200","11258300"," The only thing is, is that like with this, I don't know how deep they can go and the weird"
"11258300","11259660"," thing about it is because like."
"11260840","11263340"," I really, really, really want to scoop up some long. "
"11263340","11264480"," There you go."
"11265940","11268300"," And I just, it's not going there."
"11268480","11271100"," And so far, as long as we're above that midnight open. "
"11272320","11274100"," Well, I give it to me down there, please."
"11275380","11276940"," Right to my face right down there."
"11277720","11282160"," And in the meantime, I'm just training with the chart is telling me, you know, and it's, it's like"
"11282160","11284740"," we're going up, whatever, call this a pen and flag. "
"11285140","11285500"," I don't know."
"11286240","11286720"," Yeah."
"11287300","11293660"," We break down of it, then I'll short, but I need the candle closure and then we get a retest"
"11293660","11294120"," anyway. "
"11294840","11297140"," So I'll join the party short as well."
"11297700","11299840"," Like, like that, you know, it doesn't matter to me."
"11302120","11304780"," So if I get stopped on this runner, that's okay. "
"11305400","11311200"," And does that, if that means that we're going to go down and we could go down all the way"
"11311200","11311400"," down."
"11311400","11312580"," Yeah, I think I flushed it."
"11312640","11313060"," I'd be stoked. "
"11313260","11314480"," I've been waiting for this all day long."
"11314480","11316200"," I just need a flush, like one flush."
"11316380","11317540"," Give me one fucking flush. "
"11318520","11318860"," Yeah."
"11319160","11322440"," Looks like they're both having, right?"
"11322760","11323720"," So I don't know."
"11323860","11324640"," Call it whatever you want. "
"11325040","11326520"," Yeah, I don't know if we're going to get it."
"11326700","11328540"," I'm hoping it happens at one third."
"11328760","11331320"," I hope in the, like the, I'm hoping the hedge comes on the markets. "
"11331320","11334140"," Market starts to roll down and into the meeting."
"11334500","11337300"," Sometimes it doesn't, but when it does, I'm like, Oh, I love this."
"11337860","11340960"," And then the only thing that I ever make a mistake on here is if we do it. "
"11341960","11343540"," Sometimes they enter a little bit too early."
"11343720","11346760"," I'm like, yeah, I should buy calls right fucking now 115 or 130."
"11347200","11351320"," And then I should have waited an actual half an hour until that two PM news drop and then boom,"
"11351540","11352080"," it's off and running. "
"11353460","11353840"," Yeah."
"11354940","11355560"," Let me see."
"11355780","11356120"," Right now. "
"11356660","11357160"," Oh, yeah."
"11357400","11361320"," And there's another thing I keep an eye on always is the Tuesday range, right?"
"11362000","11364400"," They're trapping these people and I'm watching right now they're chopping."
"11364720","11367520"," I'm sure there's some bears out there right now that are like, this is it. "
"11367540","11367960"," It's the top."
"11367980","11369180"," We're going to roll down right now."
"11369860","11371560"," And I look at them more of a trap. "
"11371820","11375080"," So I'm like, Oh, they're going to trap these fuckers in here and they're going to come them all in"
"11375080","11377600"," and rip their faces off here soon."
"11378440","11379220"," It could be."
"11379480","11379780"," Could be. "
"11380240","11385780"," Let's be the kind of, you know, like, like the story, like, you know, my mentor has always said the"
"11385780","11387780"," wicks do the damage and the bodies tell the stories."
"11388220","11392200"," And that is the thing."
"11392600","11394360"," I need to, I need candle closures. "
"11396500","11396900"," Exactly."
"11397380","11398640"," You need to close this below it, right?"
"11400700","11401920"," Until then, I don't know."
"11403000","11408180"," I just want a quick bus, like, just give me a quick bus down right down to the HD fucking"
"11408180","11409200"," by the fuck out of it. "
"11410920","11416060"," Now, look, there's this, there's, there's this thing here right now that is happening in front of"
"11416060","11420360"," us and I'll show you what it is a potential short for me."
"11421800","11422400"," That's this."
"11425880","11432220"," So, look, the only thing is that we're not at a key level, but if in the next minute and"
"11432220","11437080"," 30 seconds, they close this candle underneath this little box here for me. "
"11440240","11442060"," I love the candle closures, man."
"11442200","11442640"," I watch them."
"11442760","11443300"," I watch them. "
"11443760","11448340"," I watch every candle that comes out and what's happening inside of that candle every single time."
"11449100","11455440"," But I have to be careful that I'm not being vacuumed in into these, like, five minute candles at"
"11455440","11461380"," the moment, you know, so I'm just going to switch it over to an hourly chart on a clean chart."
"11462320","11463040"," That's perfect. "
"11463460","11463520"," Right."
"11463760","11469340"," You can simply, you can simply explain this right there what you're showing right now."
"11482600","11486480"," No, this is what I was my interest, but we already tested it, right?"
"11489100","11490140"," Really like this sound. "
"11491400","11492320"," Yeah, that's nice."
"11492520","11493100"," I like that a lot."
"11502120","11502840"," Let me see. "
"11502940","11504540"," We got questions here."
"11505140","11506840"," Chase Winter says."
"11509820","11513240"," John Haggard, he says, tick magnet is also a tick magnet. "
"11513240","11520860"," And then Chase Winters said so ball crush pump regardless of whatever Powell says So Chase Winters"
"11520860","11521860"," answer your question."
"11522160","11532060"," I don't know man Today I gotta be honest They looks like a I Could"
"11532060","11541780"," be wrong in this but some of these great decisions are Non-events So you get like a ball crush"
"11542480","11550420"," But you don't necessarily get to follow through the upside that everyone's hoping for I Wonder if"
"11550420","11560220"," that's gonna happen the real move comes later Now JC 56 is saying I'm still bullish, but can we"
"11560220","11566760"," not deny the divergence is going on in the market though So JC, what are you can you expand upon"
"11566760","11567340"," that thought?"
"11568060","11574240"," La la la la says I'm bearish but for next six because it's hard it's hard at the time at"
"11574240","11579260"," the top You're also worried about Chase's question here."
"11579400","11580720"," Let me show you guys one quick thing. "
"11580740","11581020"," Okay."
"11581040","11583060"," Do you want to paint in Trump for a minute David?"
"11583400","11594740"," Go ahead All right, we're gonna talk about something here because there I think there is a But"
"11594740","11601200"," you guys do you guys realize I don't know what kind of top you're looking for but that SPX closed"
"11601200","11607740"," at it highest level every yesterday No, that's not my question some of what my question is to so,"
"11609370","11618010"," you know, it's like Anyone you're really trying to call the top for nothing because Wait for a"
"11618010","11628350"," structure to break at least we had the highest daily clothes yesterday ever I'll"
"11628350","11640280"," show you on a daily chat See on"
"11640280","11656250"," SVX Hey,"
"11656490","11659910"," I'm gonna switch over and just show these guys something really quick."
"11660210","11667090"," So, yeah Let's see if I can Maybe I can bring it down here. "
"11667170","11673150"," It's a good place to accumulate shorts in some way, of course, but like You don't know how I can"
"11673150","11677690"," go especially when I'm talking about these they're talking about Divergences, so I want to show you"
"11677690","11678650"," guys this really quick here."
"11678810","11685350"," Okay, but let's talk about divergences for a minute So I want to show you guys Well, when we come"
"11685350","11687150"," down when market breath comes down, right?"
"11687250","11694190"," We're doing a rotation Sector or sector rotation, right rotating out of like deep divesting"
"11694190","11701810"," ourselves of sectors Now you can see it down here as well, but at times price doesn't follow those"
"11701810","11704510"," rotations And you don't get a liquidation break."
"11704710","11710810"," So I want to show you two examples here Two two important examples and you can see here Just right"
"11710810","11718370"," here right right at top And you can begin to see the rotation down In market breath, but you're"
"11718370","11725250"," also seeing price follow aggressively right to the downside and Attempt to go higher and then more"
"11725250","11729490"," selling right more selling But we didn't see that right here. "
"11729650","11731150"," I want to show you another place right here."
"11731430","11732770"," So this is own right here."
"11732910","11739520"," See this zone I don't know if I've got people I think I might have people here at my house. "
"11739520","11750450"," I hope I don't But right here this one specifically one here, come on now This"
"11750450","11759670"," one specifically here is an indicator that Rather than a look like a sector liquidation Just"
"11759670","11766050"," watching this grind sideways and we what happens is they begin to accumulate again and You know"
"11766050","11771150"," people go oh, we're gonna crash here and they're not paying attention to the reaccumulation of the"
"11771150","11773970"," market We're not seeing aggressive price down."
"11774170","11778470"," You're seeing side side side And what are we seeing right here is that same thing if you look"
"11778470","11779450"," closely right here?"
"11781130","11787970"," You're seeing this side side side right side side side you're not seeing and this can this move"
"11787970","11794150"," down Any price following and you're actually seeing a reaccumulation right now and someone just"
"11794150","11795670"," said it on CNBC right?"
"11795930","11800950"," They were trying to tell you that market was overbought But yet more money came into the market"
"11800950","11801850"," yesterday, right?"
"11802490","11806770"," And you can actually see it right there that the money's coming in you can see it right here if"
"11806770","11816170"," you look very closely You can see this dip rotation out and Then a re buying going on and you"
"11816170","11821130"," can actually see it right just price action right here grinding grinding grinding Why does they"
"11821130","11822430"," want to push price higher?"
"11823250","11825490"," From this new buying that's taking place."
"11825890","11835410"," We never got a Look or a or a sector liquidation event in this in this in this"
"11838010","11841010"," Rotation that took place, but we lost it. "
"11841110","11842010"," We lose David really quick."
"11842090","11844970"," I think we met a lost David Now I'm here."
"11845090","11846510"," I'll be back in five minutes. "
"11846810","11854950"," Okay, take a break So what what divergence are you talking about like we're talking about real"
"11854950","11860170"," money buying here real money rotation You see a rotation out of stocks, and you see a rotation back"
"11860170","11863010"," in the stocks You don't see price going down."
"11863350","11865190"," What's the what's the divergence that you mean?"
"11865230","11869290"," I guess I'm missing something I'm the divergence that you're discussing here."
"11869930","11876850"," There'd be one thing I would say would be Yeah, we're catching a bounce right now on spoons like"
"11876850","11878730"," they bought the fuck out of it just then right?"
"11879490","11884210"," So people are all hemmed in short and they we took it to the tick to the half hour trigger"
"11886190","11888250"," I Might be missing the point then JC. "
"11888610","11901350"," I apologize if I'm if I'm missing the point my brother Yes,"
"11901350","11909390"," I'm not seeing what you're maybe seeing I see I saw a rotation out of Risk risk on sectors."
"11909690","11914330"," They start rotation into like Excel you and things like that and then Then now I'm seeing a"
"11914330","11920710"," rotation back in the risk again Divergence with HYG."
"11920850","11930440"," Okay, okay, so I miss I miss that RSI MACD stochastic yeah, I"
"11930440","11932840"," can't speak for those indicators. "
"11933260","11943080"," I don't use them I don't use RSI MACD any of that stuff You're saying correction I got you negative"
"11943080","11949500"," divergences on those On those indicators, I think there's some of the poorest indicators out there"
"11953980","11963840"," I It's a tough one that's a tough one to discuss now HYG I will say this about HYG"
"11963840","11973120"," I do look for divergences and HYG versus SBY That they will of course come back to meet again"
"11973120","11977660"," that they resolve each other No, I like HYG."
"11977760","11979180"," I think HYG is a great indicator."
"11979680","11979920"," Absolutely. "
"11980280","11980440"," Love it."
"11981220","11989240"," I Love HYG."
"11989340","11995500"," I don't don't want to be mixing I'm just I'm talking about RSI and MACD and all those stochastic"
"11995500","12005350"," indicators by themselves Now really quick we'll switch over to the trigger screen here And"
"12005350","12007350"," I just want to show you right now. "
"12007490","12012230"," They did buy the dip right in that half hour trigger They bought it again earlier down over here"
"12012230","12020910"," and they're doing it yet again right now I Still want to buy down here."
"12021090","12022430"," They're not giving me the hourly trigger."
"12022670","12028570"," They're just like fuck you We're going to buy the half and just move it on up Target above right"
"12028570","12065460"," now 5 16 24 RSI"
"12065460","12073060"," is useful to understand its default is the 14 Wilder ZMA which is equal to a 27 normally a lot"
"12073060","12086710"," of traders use RSI So when looking at 27 you're sinking against other traders that use RSI Do"
"12086710","12096190"," Barry saying bowls need to recapture yesterday's highs and base or retest for possible 5 17 If"
"12096190","12101290"," bears can muscle up and reject 5 16, then we may go down and Q looks like it's getting ready"
"12101290","12110450"," to rally Chase is saying massive call open interest Right, I don't know about that squeeze or they"
"12110450","12119670"," don't print them For me right now if you guys want to see what I'm looking at for Let's take"
"12119670","12120050"," a look at this. "
"12120190","12124850"," This is a SMCI, but SPX So just right here."
"12125010","12128910"," This is your local resistance I'll move these red boxes out of the way."
"12129250","12131410"," There's two things that I'm looking for here. "
"12135610","12145490"," I Want to be above 5,200 Not a lot of room here is there And"
"12145490","12155290"," this is what my concern is we go back to this So here's SPX right this is the SPX gamma"
"12155290","12156050"," situation."
"12156170","12160150"," This is the previous high Right previous high right there."
"12160650","12168250"," Let me move this back a little bit So For me personally, right what I'm looking at here is there's"
"12168250","12172890"," not a ton of like I can see all this right buyers stepping in buyers Stepping and they just keep"
"12172890","12178950"," buying it buying it buying it right and I don't see a lot of room here Right, that's not a"
"12178950","12182310"," ton of room right there right but 250 180. "
"12182730","12185470"," I guess it's some room This is not a ton of room."
"12185810","12194810"," I always would see stuff like this and I'm like Yeah My risk versus reward is it really there for"
"12194810","12203070"," that little thing right there if anything, I'd really like to see price jump over it and Make a new"
"12203070","12210810"," high right get the new high pull it back down and I'm off and running to 5,300 Like some"
"12210810","12212690"," me that's the trade for me right there."
"12212990","12214130"," It's like the big money trade. "
"12214130","12217390"," I feel good up here But this right here."
"12217610","12224150"," I'm more looking for for where we are right now I'd be more looking for you know the failure and"
"12224150","12228630"," we're not an event day to right All we need is some bad news or I don't I don't know"
"12228630","12234770"," Jerome to say something bad and boom we get the flush down And I feel way more confident down here"
"12234770","12242110"," buying Something here with a stop underneath it right got nice bunch of room here to trade Note"
"12242110","12244570"," like see that nice beautiful rip higher here."
"12244630","12252090"," So I'm either above this Or I'm down here This right here where we are right now. "
"12252090","12253590"," I have no interest in it."
"12253770","12254750"," I'll be honest with you."
"12254750","12265770"," I have no interest Let's look at this on Let's"
"12268810","12280250"," put this back down below here It's that previous high This is local resistance right here It's"
"12280250","12283970"," like we're scalping for Yeah, let's look at it like this. "
"12284030","12286330"," So we're on this chart right here, right?"
"12286510","12287410"," This is that 520."
"12289350","12290410"," I Guess there's room."
"12290650","12294530"," I guess this looks like there's room That's that 520 right. "
"12294710","12299870"," This is what we're trying to trade right now So the only thing that I would say to you would"
"12299870","12305410"," be this would be as long as you're buying this stuff Uh, yeah, the move is higher right smash it"
"12305410","12309050"," up smash it up smash it up smash it up smash it up Until you can get up here and"
"12309050","12310170"," trade that 520 now."
"12310470","12311990"," I'm gonna preface this for you."
"12312010","12317250"," Okay, we are on a fucking I'm sorry for saying f Run fed day. "
"12317650","12320370"," So We're in high volatility."
"12321030","12322210"," This is the last day of it, right?"
"12322830","12323510"," We're in a high vault."
"12323690","12330070"," We have volatility today run fed day and What do we what did I tell you on your market briefs?"
"12331110","12337970"," You'll be humming right along and All of a sudden the floor drops out from underneath you If we"
"12337970","12342730"," were in a low volatility situation, I would say to you no, it's not gonna happen every dip will be"
"12342730","12343470"," bought, right?"
"12344450","12348890"," Any pullbacks will be bought you can stay David say a few minutes ago. "
"12349270","12353850"," The market loves to give you second, third, fourth chances Normal circumstances."
"12354350","12359010"," I would say that applies here That if you're even if you're in the wrong trade, it's likely gonna"
"12359010","12365870"," turn up for you anyways down the road But on a day like today on a fed day I don't"
"12365870","12370250"," think it's I don't think it's Just where we are right now, right?"
"12371990","12376810"," It's not impossible for us to be like yeah, we're going up or went up and then boom straight down"
"12378130","12381750"," Right, and that's where you actually should be buying is down in here, right?"
"12382670","12386670"," So It's hard to discuss that for today."
"12387070","12396970"," I should say Yeah, I think we posted it in"
"12396970","12402730"," the we posted it inside the chat that indicator that you're asking about The check if you look"
"12402730","12406790"," inside either of the chats you'll be able to see the and it's like TTX or something like that"
"12414840","12422640"," Market convincing you to stay in a to stay in a losing trade If we're not in a volatile"
"12422640","12428360"," environments all dips should be bought does that make sense the market should be supportive Let's"
"12428360","12433300"," see you're in the upside down that trade You shouldn't be worried about it only in only in a"
"12433300","12444500"," volatile environments right now which we're in right now Yeah, I'm"
"12444500","12449040"," back cool let me switch back over I'm cooking and in the background. "

"13218940","13222320"," Yeah, I think it's possible the most important answer to the most important question of this"
"13222320","13227160"," meeting When might the fed start cutting rates could come right at 2 p.m In the statement not"
"13227160","13231340"," necessarily from the press government from the statement If the fed repeats a critical line from"
"13231340","13235800"," the last announcement announcement in january They said quote the committee does not expect it will"
"13235800","13240720"," be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence That inflation is"
"13240720","13242460"," moving sustainably towards 2 percent."
"13242700","13246900"," Well, they repeat that it's going to be like going back in time resetting the clock Once again"
"13246900","13251440"," telling investors they still don't have that confidence to cut rates need additional data Maybe"
"13251440","13256340"," months of data showing declining inflation before they're ready to firmly telegraph any rate cuts"
"13256340","13261820"," Along with the statement new projections could provide clues to the policy outlook as well They"
"13261820","13266780"," projected in december GDP at 1.4 percent running a little hotter in the first quarter 2 percent"
"13266780","13268540"," unemployment They projected at 4-1. "
"13268680","13275120"," Well, they're creeping up to it towards 3.9 Core pce you can see there 2-9 in january, maybe"
"13275120","13280080"," 2-8 2-9 in february So running a little hotter than their year-end forecast and there's the fed"
"13280080","13285540"," funds rate with that projection for a 4.6 There is some concern that the individual fed members"
"13285540","13292640"," once they get done projecting it could take off one of those rate cuts from the projection there"
"13292640","13299100"," and raise their outlook for the federal reserve Funds rate for the end of the year it would take"
"13299100","13303560"," only two members to do that I'll leave it there Tyler throw it back to you We'll look at the"
"13303560","13308420"," projections and also looking for some information perhaps on the balance sheet and what's expected"

"13326920","13334320"," How often do they plot the dots and uh just walk me through it Okay, so the dot plots are"
"13334320","13341160"," the individual forecasts of federal reserve members For where they believe the federal funds rate"
"13341160","13349280"," should be at the end of this next year 2026 and the long run They take all those dots and"
"13349280","13356140"," they create a median out of it And it's what is the general or average projection of the federal"
"13356140","13363180"," reserve for the funds rate that they set The problem with the dot plot is it is confused for policy"
"13363180","13371680"," Ah They give you the dot it comes up with an average and that averages 4.6 And people confuse"
"13371680","13377220"," that for being the policy of the federal reserve to reduce it to 4.6 It is not the policy."
"13377540","13383860"," It is simply a derived average of 19 different Kind of guess policy from there. "
"13384060","13389100"," Yeah, they look to be cutting And if there are fewer dots at a at a at a lower range"
"13389100","13394900"," It might mean that they're going to be projecting fewer cuts Yeah, it doesn't mean that's the"
"13394900","13400820"," policy of the fed just their outlook all things being All of the truth is their forecast in all the"
"13400820","13408080"," words of forecast of what it's bullshit About forecasts tell me Well, I was just going to use the"

"13745920","13787460"," so you can see it better So"
"13787460","13793280"," david should we be happy if the fed indicates that it may cut only two times this year or maybe"
"13793280","13798120"," three times this year Uh, should we be happy about that or should we be because it would suggest"
"13798120","13804360"," that the economy is growing nicely Uh, and unemployment is not rising all that much If at all or"
"13804360","13808300"," should we be worried because it would be a suggestion that inflation is stickier and more"
"13809460","13815080"," Intransigent than we would like So let's deal with the inflation question first I think their you"
"13815080","13820520"," know city's view our view is that we are Really in a situation where our highest confidence is that"
"13820520","13824440"," inflation is definitely going to be down At the two and a half percent level, you know at the end"
"13824440","13828440"," of this year, which is very much the fed's target There may be some noise along the way, but"
"13828440","13833060"," january and furbory were a little hotter in point of fact because price increases took place At"
"13833060","13837200"," that time and we really see the best majority of the inflation indicators heading down with the"
"13837200","13841140"," exception Potentially a fuel and taking a look at the other side, right?"
"13841340","13844600"," Of course the economy, you know We thought they kind of be was going to be slow then grow that"
"13844600","13849240"," it was going to slow down now and accelerate We just increased our earnings per share projections"
"13849240","13854180"," from five percent this year to seven and a half Which is a large change for the unit average stock"
"13854180","13859060"," for the s&p And with that we're building in the idea that that the markets can go higher based"
"13859060","13863000"," on those earnings But the fed at the end of the day has to come up with a plan to"
"13863000","13867600"," normalize that rate curve Right to actually see it right have an upward slope And the longer"
"13867600","13872200"," weights to do that it actually adds risk to the market and it takes away that possibility of"
"13872200","13876500"," resilience And I think that Jerome Powell sort of said that at the last meeting when he said that"
"13876500","13880960"," the idea of normalizing right He doesn't have to wait for every signal in terms of inflation to be"
"13880960","13885180"," in place in order to begin lowering rates Because he knows that leaving them at this level with"
"13885180","13890280"," this level of qt actually is itself a danger to the economy That's that's very interesting Julia."
"13890480","13895720"," Let me conclude with you to pick up on on what uh, David just sort of referenced there and that"
"13895720","13902940"," is the idea that um That the fed might cut rates before Uh, it doesn't have to wait for perfection."
"13903320","13910080"," It might cut rates before inflation gets to two percent not waiting until it does Yes, absolutely"
"13910080","13912480"," the the fed still believe where do I want to buy?"
"13913040","13918740"," Um, I want to buy Five Powell has said point blank if we wait, well, I mean, I really liked"

"14400750","14401050"," second."
"14401330","14406650"," We'll do something here because I normally do this and I didn't do it today Uh, what am I doing"

"14426010","14472320"," one quick second here Me"
"14472320","14491730"," one quick second here now 124 with a half an hour ahead of us So"
"14491730","14501830"," the expected move today is 519 0 1 on the upside, okay So 519 0 1 And"
"14501830","14504290"," you can see this Valhalla trade up here, right?"
"14505650","14510430"," So upside expected move today if we get it up if we get an expect if we get the expected"
"14510430","14516570"," move to the upside You've expected range of about 519 and change it's a little bit lower than here,"
"14516750","14516850"," right?"
"14517110","14527230"," So we'll actually lower this down a little bit 519 0 1 right there Uh, we'll"
"14527230","14528550"," call it Valhalla, right?"
"14528850","14537990"," Everyone's saying we're going to 520 today Bring this one where we are there we go 519 right there"
"14540850","14551550"," Then the downside move for today is 511 511 94 And"
"14551550","14559790"," so just right down here, right that 511 94 is right in this zone right here Right down here So"
"14559790","14565850"," i'm telling you that i'm looking for a dip buy down here, right if we go zone to zone Whether"
"14565850","14569830"," that's down below and then all the way up to 519 if we were to go zone to zone today,"
"14569870","14575790"," right up and down let's say any kind of weakness Uh, you've got me telling you yeah, I want to"
"14575790","14577390"," buy this shit right down here, right?"
"14577390","14582110"," I want that a little bit of weakness down here to buy The upside target is up here. "
"14582110","14586490"," So this is your expected range today Right in here."
"14586550","14592330"," One of the posits that I have is that this fed rate decision might be a no uh, like a"
"14592330","14601510"," like a like a It's like a no event a non-event Terms of volatility if we don't trade outside"
"14601510","14608550"," of this range above that 519 nor below this This is just your one sigma move right the expected"
"14608550","14613030"," range for today Now what else happens when we make these moves?"
"14613090","14614550"," Let's say we move up here, right?"
"14615950","14623490"," This expected target up to the upside here 519 oftentimes on an event day Now you'll see a failure"
"14623490","14626910"," to get there You'll actually see the market."
"14626910","14633610"," Let's say we let's say the market responds well, right and price rips higher You'll actually see a"
"14633610","14640470"," failure before we get there And that goes your first there goes your first Uh, re-pricing of"
"14640470","14640950"," options. "
"14641250","14643190"," So you bought 50 cent calls."
"14643270","14644890"," Let's say they're expensive spot, right?"
"14647790","14650570"," Like 519's are 63 cents, right?"
"14651390","14654670"," So you're hold on So you're in calls."
"14655170","14657190"," We blast up your 63 cent calls. "
"14657430","14663810"," Maybe they go to a dollar Uh, what is it here dollar?"
"14665450","14673170"," dollar 20 or 30 or 40 Regardless even the premium kick the kicks into whatever right so you're like"
"14673170","14679670"," up here Then we come back down here these little little algorithms these little dealers and market"
"14679670","14686250"," makers they will reprice on ball crush And now these options that were 60 cents here 65 cents,"
"14686290","14688770"," whatever they are We'll restart."
"14689070","14690690"," Let's say at 35 cents."
"14690930","14691490"," Does that make sense?"
"14693150","14694950"," And then they'll make another move higher here. "
"14695270","14703010"," Then you might get 70 cents on that second Rip higher Right so you can re-pricing re-pricing as"
"14703010","14709970"," time goes on same thing though applies as well to Uh, the downside oftentimes right you come back"
"14709970","14713590"," down here you slam down here You see the puts your expensive puts go in the money."
"14713750","14718030"," They're like a hundred percent up or something like that Uh, and they start to bleed them off and"
"14718030","14723690"," then they re-price them in here How do you get around that would be the question or the question"
"14723690","14730770"," I guess is how do you get around that re-pricing one way Of course is uh by using spreads"
"14730770","14735630"," right if you're using spread you're not gonna have to worry about other re-pricing of those options"
"14735630","14743510"," another way that you can another way that you can Combat this is by not trading until options are"
"14743510","14749130"," re-priced Uh, so if you see the if you see the initial upside move, you see the failure that"
"14749130","14753710"," comes back down You're watching the options chain Right, you're still kind of bullish like yeah"
"14753710","14753970"," bullish."
"14754190","14755010"," We're taking the trade boom. "
"14755270","14759470"," That's where you take the trade right there Uh, you've already been told that it's bullish news."
"14759710","14764490"," You're kind of more confident in your upside moves Same thing if we were to blast down right doom"
"14764490","14768230"," and gloom from the fed And then all of a sudden you see it come right back up again for"
"14768230","14772910"," the next down move over here And you're kind of like yeah, I'm gonna take instead of taking this"
"14772910","14778250"," trade And losing all that put premium I'm going to jump in on the second trade over here and take"
"14778250","14783750"," this one down into the close At the end of the day So at least from an options perspective the"
"14783750","14797120"," market is priced in to 519 and 511 and change uh for today I'm"
"14797120","14806850"," going to switch over now to the fed And try to bring up Let's see here, uh, let's do the"

"19503310","19508630"," You can see a pullback Uh, but there is an expectation that we'll go higher here, but there should"
"19508630","19510250"," be a pullback on this r1."
"19510270","19517910"," Just be aware of it um, I I think It's it's we think that rates next target to the upside"
"19517910","19527670"," of bahala, baby 52 2.50 for for reasons that are mostly, you know Important slow"
"19527670","19530890"," moving large things like demographics and productivity."
"19530890","19535810"," Yeah, yes, a little moving So large things things that don't move quickly Um, but I don't think we"
"19535810","19541250"," know I mean I My instinct would be that rates will not go back down to the very low levels"
"19541250","19547010"," that we saw Where all around the world that were long-run rates that were at or below zero Uh,"
"19547090","19551830"," in some cases I don't see love rates going back down to that level But I think there's tremendous"
"19551830","19555910"," uncertainty around that Great and just a quick follow on the projections. "
"19556230","19562450"," You also have 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year It's already at are you mentioned"
"19562450","19563670"," it being 2.8 in February?"
"19564290","19566550"," That doesn't sound like much disinflation at all."
"19566550","19568690"," So are you really are you still competent?"
"19570710","19575050"," The last press conference you sounded pretty optimistic you would get more confidence to the end of"
"19575050","19581810"," this year Is it right to say that this suggests you're not seeing a lot of Disinflation this year"
"19581810","19589070"," compared to what we've seen 2023 and so I think that that that higher year and Number reflects the"

"19617230","19620830"," we will as soon as they went up and said that there will be red cuts But that's where I"
"19620830","19621550"," went off the green."
"19621750","19626970"," I pointed you out to that 18 Is in the second half of the daughter we have some pretty low"
"19626970","19631350"," readings Resistant here at the floor if you mower for a window forward."
"19631410","19636270"," So what happened was they tagged it We're looking for data from the kind of low ratings first thing"
"19636270","19643850"," I do here Is uh, I'm not long from higher zone confidence Is really a bucket moving system. "
"19643930","19647310"," I've already got two percent I keep a high on the scene of the crime toward two percent and the"
"19647310","19654430"," previous day high That is a level that must hold for me to continue to go back up So Thank"
"19654430","19673170"," you for your question So I went mama here No Right"

"19685370","19689890"," is that next target to the upside workers are getting good and you know, it doesn't really matter"
"19689890","19695170"," because If they go up what you would do is potentially my trade is kind of what you did last"
"19695170","19699570"," year Which is a bigger economy like that where you know inflationary pressures are not increasing"
"19699570","19704110"," They were but I'll wait to react to you can't have that if you see I've already marked up supply"
"19704110","19710810"," side Act act to remain a privilege I want this to buy from hearing supply chains and also go with"
"19710810","19720910"," and then we can go to the south to 506"
"19720910","19725730"," 30 points that you saw last year if I have my living order and inflation is coming down with it"
"19725730","19731910"," We now have a better sense that and I think part of that was Supply side healing particularly with"

"21197500","21202480"," lesion report doing it in the micros and then it had the minis In a long or something like that."
"21202540","21206600"," I've done you could do that But it's a lot of work and I like the focus just on one"
"21206600","21211160"," chart and be in and out really quickly We're very transparent. "
"21211360","21213200"," Yeah, they're making a reversal right now."
"21213300","21215040"," You see it Speaking to the public."
"21215180","21221840"," Yeah, yeah, and that's why I'm saying, you know, it's it's the management of those stops six years"
"21221840","21230280"," to To get that under control In the right way I mean, that's why I always tell everyone to be"
"21230280","21236680"," realistic with your roles in taking profits Don't think we're gonna go to The moon or something"
"21236680","21239160"," like that, you know What is high probable?"
"21239620","21246900"," What are levels that I know a hundred percent certain that are going to get touched Yeah People are"
"21246900","21249140"," very positive right now, David inside of this. "
"21249240","21255700"," They're all laughing and shit smiling You know, I'm talking about trends within the bigger trend,"
"21255980","21256100"," right?"
"21256520","21263040"," These are just typical rotations that go back into things like You know, I'm clear about where it's"
"21263040","21263720"," going, right?"
"21264120","21271320"," And but like I said for me, it doesn't You know Yeah, you're trading a different time frame though"
"21271320","21278100"," your trade was a 15 second time frame you were trading or no Yeah, yeah A 30 second time frame"
"21278100","21282060"," and like if you look at on a five-minute track, there's nothing there's nothing happening right"
"21284240","21289520"," It's like we don't expect it will be appropriate to put things into perspective I'm trading on a 30"
"21289520","21293180"," minute down below here on the right hand side And then I got a one-minute chart up on the"
"21293180","21300400"," back hand side these those the people on stream can't see it but Yeah, but you see on the five "
"21300400","21305520","-minute there's nothing going on Absolutely nothing in the 30-minute candles holding right now."
"21305520","21309700"," So I'm like, yeah, I'm still long I'm not fucking selling this shit So it depends if you're swing"
"21309700","21314400"," trading or something I got and I strongly just if you're trading a five-minute unless you're"
"21314400","21324240"," scalping the way I'm showing it now Stick to that This"
"21324240","21332180"," is the over under on the five-minute chart Okay, if we get back down into this area here, there's"
"21332180","21338080"," a possibility that I can scoop another log From here and swing it back if the target has not been"
"21338080","21345140"," So it's fractal we'll just have to see how the data is great for everyone in every dimension We"
"21345140","21350440"," would of course love to get about 20 points is 20 points really interflation So and that is why I'm"
"21350440","21354680"," using this model template Are you guys out there on stream in the chat?"
"21354940","21357700"," Are you guys long right now or not long right now?"
"21358240","21360940"," January and February which I talked about a couple of times."
"21360960","21364020"," Are you guys all along the market or are you short the market here?"
"21365880","21368680"," Do you think that 520 will hold?"
"21370080","21371600"," 5,200 right?"
"21371780","21379780"," So I said 520 I meant 5,200 You guys you got we're above 5,200 right now If 50"
"21379780","21382960"," so we should come I'm gonna tell you guys a couple things out there right now. "
"21383020","21390440"," Okay, I'm gonna tell you guys a couple things Wherever we go up we are definitely coming back down"
"21390440","21392700"," to 5,200 to retest it."
"21392880","21393700"," Do you understand me?"
"21394920","21400820"," So when we're done going up here, we're gonna come back down and and retest 5,200 to make sure"
"21401520","21403820"," That that is the now floor."
"21404120","21411920"," I want you to realize okay, and this squeeze when it's done I'm telling you we're gonna hold 52 and"
"21411920","21420180"," I'm gonna tell you something else 5200 right 25 is now support And it needs to be confirmed, but"
"21420180","21427620"," it's now support and our target ultimately is 5,300 that is the target 5,300 But"
"21427620","21436630"," we're done heads up out there be careful the oppressor just ended"
"21436630","21447330"," Be careful David my brother Keep an eye on 52 25 0.79 on spx 52"
"21447330","21457160"," 25 0.79 0.79 Yes then Let me"
"21457160","21467140"," have a look do another projection Yes, I've got 52 25 is top Yeah,"
"21467280","21467820"," it's about right. "
"21468220","21477450"," Well, yeah, good go higher But it's a standard deviation of this consolidation area Oh dude, they"
"21477450","21484450"," are blasting these Thank you for the free money if you're out there short right now and puts thank"
"21484450","21491320"," you very much for the free money That's it."
"21491420","21492080"," I'm flat right here."
"21492180","21492620"," I'm flat. "
"21492820","21493600"," I'm fucking flat."
"21493720","21496980"," I'm not gonna wait for this last little bar Just a word."
"21497100","21498680"," I'm gonna switch over down here. "
"21498740","21501820"," I want to show you guys something okay Uh, so I'm flat."
"21502100","21502280"," Hold on."
"21502400","21519140"," I gotta I gotta tell people I'm flat Now that's that almost had to target but I just"
"21519140","21526480"," want to show you guys on I want to show you guys one quick thing bottom right hand screen So"
"21526480","21526980"," right here. "
"21527200","21528640"," I want to want you to see something here."
"21528760","21530700"," This is david's yellow line right here."
"21530740","21537640"," It's just above that blue line See how we're squeezing up here right now just squeezing squeezing"
"21537640","21540420"," squeezing We can jump over here. "
"21540660","21546120"," Whoop Right and do this to go up here, but I want you to know that this part right here"
"21546570","21547920"," I want nothing to do with it."
"21548120","21555320"," If you want to know why I don't want nothing to do with it It's because They can red bar"
"21555320","21561480"," our asses straight down right here If this happens they've read they've read bars straight down Uh,"
"21562340","21566780"," you know instead of instead of pushing over they're just pushing us straight down I don't want to"
"21566780","21575420"," get caught in that So the trade is the trade is here Trade is not right here."
"21575900","21580240"," You might be the guy that wants to take the trade from right here I'm not that guy. "
"21580400","21585020"," I want to take the trade down somewhere down in here because that makes sense now if we break above"
"21586420","21591780"," 52 25 and can consolidate Make a new high right here."
"21592280","21601580"," I will then jump back on board this trade again to 50 52 50 Now you're going to be the"
"21601580","21603240"," guy that jumps in again up there, right?"
"21603520","21604600"," Well, I'm trying to get out."
"21604920","21611820"," I'm exiting as you are entering those trades Just keep your eyes on this right here If you want"
"21611820","21618740"," another upside move here, I would recommend that you wait until you get above 52 25 All right,"
"21618940","21627840"," david go ahead Yeah So, um, yeah, I'm not going to know where they are at right now, but I"
"21627840","21636160"," got your screen back up brother All right, cool Todd Lee, baby The reason why I have that on spx"
"21636160","21640260"," is because I look at this consolidation and it's basically a standard deviation of this"
"21640260","21643920"," consolidation area here Which is giving me the outside targets. "
"21644200","21648820"," I rarely use them because it's for um Yeah, all time highs."
"21649040","21657910"," I like using them more And these are upside targets even up there, but yeah, I don't know how long"
"21657910","21662820"," I will take press to get there Like for today."
"21663240","21664020"," This should be good. "
"21664380","21665400"," Yeah, I'm done today."
"21665460","21666180"," I'm far right now."
"21666240","21666320"," Dude. "

"21667460","21668320"," I'm fucking stoked."
"21668380","21678000"," I'm happy But it's just not gonna happen right now because um Just always remember, you know Look"
"21678000","21684660"," if they want to sell it down the higher they go They want to sell it as high as possible. "
"21684840","21690300"," So For example, if you think now stack is at its top guess again because I don't think we're at"
"21690300","21696120"," the top dude No, you know, I don't think we're at the top Well, that's my opinion and I will"
"21696120","21696800"," be proven wrong."
"21696980","21701420"," Okay, so someone just asked uh, what point do we go down question mark?"

"22768900","22769720"," This bears are out here."
"22769780","22778820"," Just drooling right now Yeah, so drooling that's why I drew it is over under here Here, you know as"
"22778820","22783480"," a zone where I would short Typically to this zone here, right?"
"22783940","22786700"," So what are you short to what's your target for short?"
"22787280","22789860"," Here this that I drew out here. "
"22790100","22796480"," So just the yellow box just right here Yeah And then I scale out and wait because so do you"
"22796480","22799980"," consider that a liquidation break or do you consider that the markets rolling over here?"
"22800920","22801560"," Well, there we go."
"22801560","22802660"," I'm on that trade too."
"22802780","22809560"," You know the thing is you don't know yet because It starts off like like this, right?"
"22810600","22817700"," It's very subtle But whatever happens you like if you think you missed it And let's say if they for"
"22817700","22818560"," example, that's it. "
"22818620","22826720"," They should fail here on SPX right like 520 Right I'd get break even here because I'll just wait"
"22826720","22833120"," for reprising because the beautiful thing about this view of the patients And let's say if this"
"22833120","22840920"," does roll over and if it is a rollover then you have time to get in So, you know, let"
"22840920","22847520"," me show you guys what you're talking about here on my screen that's what I'm gonna switch over"
"22847520","22853860"," right here you see this green candle right here saying it's got time right so if this green candle"
"22853860","22862040"," fails right here your immediate next red candle is gonna be a bloodbath right down there"
"22862040","22869020"," but you need to make sure that you break this previous one right here okay so let's watch how this"
"22869020","22875880"," candle works itself out here so this new candle right here to come down and start raining down you"
"22875880","22883280"," see the see the bulls with weakness right here weakness by bulls buyers right here they'll run this"
"22883280","22893210"," right straight down right here I like what I like"
"22893210","22897250"," about NASDAQ it's like even though we didn't reach the target yet I got your backup on the screen"
"22897250","22903970"," brother yeah your screen is back up again oh okay no what I the thing is what I like about"
"22903970","22910390"," NASDAQ is to further down we go since we didn't meet the target yet that I had once you achieve"
"22910390","22920250"," and SP SPX did so like if they saw this down now and then that I would love that because"
"22920250","22929990"," I would consider longing London again to reach the objective right but it could be you know they"
"22929990","22934930"," could be doing it from here that they do it into the clothes they're trying it right now yeah you"
"22934930","22939770"," see the yellow line that I mentioned and let's go back to the five-minute chart what is happening"
"22939770","22948750"," there and the beautiful part about this is is that like these reversals if it isn't actual reversal"
"22948750","22955370"," it will show itself it will show its hand on the five minute chart also in the same pattern that"
"22955370","22961730"," I just drew out on the 32nd chart except it will take much longer for it to evolve and to"
"22961730","22969950"," develop where you have plenty of time to join the party for a reversion trade back down so there's"
"22969950","22977470"," there's one there's there's something there for everyone and but like we're now yeah it's just the"
"22977470","22984970"," trend is still up but you need to be very careful because you see this is this is the hard"
"22984970","22994720"," part about it I'm going to take these things off for a minute to show you what I mean oh"
"22994720","23001160"," here we go dude that the buyers are still there dude or yeah but wait the buyers are still there"
"23001160","23009420"," they're there dude they're gonna do it to them be married look they're gonna blast them dude watch"
"23009420","23030660"," this these fucking bears are all wrapped up right now they're all hot and sweaty now"
"23030660","23035160"," I'm gonna build up yet I'm not I'm I got a target to buy I got it that's lower I"
"23035160","23042640"," got it over this is what I'm looking at right here hold on I want this to this is my"
"23042640","23047060"," chart that I'm looking at right here you see I'm looking for I want us with the problem here the"
"23047060","23051860"," reason I'm not bringing it down fast is because of this bullshit right here see these buyers right"
"23051860","23062820"," here don't use and fucking guys right here don't even consider buying about 5200 SPS it's not"
"23062820","23069900"," worth it yeah I got to see a turnaround I either have to see a turnaround like I would need"
"23069900","23079840"," to see that right there to begin considering it along from right here or I would need to see"
"23079840","23085940"," I wouldn't look exactly like that it would be more like yeah I guess you can zig it and zag"
"23085940","23095410"," it but that's like a really simple line what would be something like that"
"23095410","23106930"," doesn't look good at all looks like a disaster to Dave like right"
"23106930","23115330"," there my this drawing looks like dog shit"
"23115330","23124990"," like it wouldn't even consider that trade unless it was right there have to come up show itself"
"23124990","23129830"," that we're going higher than I would take it and then down here I would need to see it blast"
"23129830","23134930"," down down here and then I would need to see the trade come back up and I would take that"
"23134930","23139510"," part of the trade right there but none of that's happened yet there's no trade here right now for"
"23139510","23144590"," me well yeah the thing is it's for me it's very simple you know I need a bullish for a"
"23144590","23151270"," value gap to evolve again for me to take along or a bearish one to yeah bearish one or a"
"23151270","23158950"," bullish one yeah short or long I want to bearish one for example you know the same thing what I"
"23158950","23167890"," was showing down here look this tell me switch over so they can see your brother uh good yeah you"
"23167890","23177830"," see this barrier for a value gap here this one here yeah yeah right down there like that one too"
"23177830","23187690"," and that is when I buy so you know I need to see something evolve like that before I"
"23187690","23194130"," consider taking the line and but for now like I said when I showed you in the 32nd chart it"
"23194130","23202050"," was a short so um yeah to here so let me ask you the next question so let us share"
"23202050","23211190"," my screen with you down here bottom right hand screen so let's look this is uh spx right now right"
"23211190","23215810"," the gamma on spx yeah close some of this let me get rid of this I don't want to get"
"23215810","23224280"," rid of all of it so here okay show you guys all that right there so I want you to"
"23224280","23229700"," see this right here right we had the previous high back here we would need it to get above we've"
"23229700","23239660"," got uh spx gamut 5200 right over here and see"
"23239660","23245720"," how they try to roll this down right now and my next trade wouldn't be well I guess if we"
"23245720","23249800"," were trading like that my next trade wouldn't be until we had a new high again right new high over"
"23249800","23259280"," 52 25 yeah because even then you can only trade the bounce you can't really trade you can't really"
"23259280","23264800"," even trade like if you reverse all this down you still need that new high to confirm the leg higher"
"23265700","23275510"," on uh on the hourly trigger yeah and and you see that that is why I raise my stops all"
"23275510","23282030"," the time um like if you look on spx now I got you back on screen again yeah if you"
"23282030","23289390"," if you see you know remember I told you to go short already on this new candle here that showed"
"23289390","23295990"," me you know to eject one we reached a target where we were supposed or I was looking for reversals"
"23295990","23302410"," to set up then we have this setup here this reversal pattern that you come along again um along"
"23302410","23315850"," again David I fucked up and yeah I can't move I have to wait and that's"
"23315850","23323710"," the thing about that 50 I'm gonna see if they can ride it into the bell here yeah sure you"
