"66880","67520"," Good morning. "
"68240","70340"," I'm fucking some shit up already here."
"72800","73820"," That's fucking go."
"74120","74880"," Can you guys hear me?"
"78220","79820"," Right on, right on, right on. "
"80920","83440"," All right, we'll turn this shit off and just get right into it."
"87260","87620"," All right."
"90290","92110"," Zimme, just a little bit scaled back here today. "
"92450","93150"," We're a little bit late too."
"93210","94070"," It's already eight-ten in the morning."
"96010","97230"," I hope this, I hope this works. "
"97810","101870"," I just sat here and had to, I actually just had to work on my microphone for the past 10"
"101870","103310"," minutes, half an hour, 20 minutes."
"105010","106270"," Good to see everybody this morning."
"107730","111850"," I posted this one publicly on Twitter instead of the, instead of just our night captain's alpha. "
"112410","116590"," I've been on it about a week, well, because I think it's five trading days and then yesterday and"
"116590","117470"," then the last Friday."

"144450","144670"," Troy. "
"146490","148170"," We'll end up, we'll end up, we'll end up on shit later."
"148170","154150"," We're going to talk about a few things for CPI coming out at 8.30. So we're going to switch"
"154150","154730"," it right over."
"155030","158810"," We're going to get into the 8.30 hour of course. "
"159450","160730"," So we're going to turn this down here."
"161730","164450"," We're going to switch right over to what we're doing."
"164850","167950"," So we only have 19 minutes until CPI numbers come out. "
"168550","171850"," This morning I was watching, we'll get into like the, where have I been and all that kind of stuff"
"171850","175470"," after the decision at 8.30. We'll talk about that kind of stuff."
"177810","180670"," Tell me if you guys can hear any kind of a hissing in the background."
"181550","182890"," On my end, I can hear hissing. "
"183590","185270"," If you can hear hissing, let me know."
"186170","186790"," Julian Billy."
"187270","187330"," L."
"187570","187590"," Ram. "

"191430","192090"," Good to see you too."
"192930","193610"," Dean Nahn."
"194090","194770"," Everybody's showing up. "
"194870","196090"," This is good to see people this morning."
"199830","200890"," Mike got way louder."
"201170","201250"," Okay. "
"201290","202130"," I'm going to turn that down right now."
"202230","211770"," You know what I think is that I think that my, I think that my, I needed to reboot Streamlabs"
"211770","214510"," OBS to kick in the, the mic."
"216370","218770"," Yeah, to kick in my mic mixer. "
"219410","220650"," So whatever, I don't care."
"220810","223750"," We'll just let it slide for today because it's already so fucked up as it is."
"226230","230490"," They got a new setup on my third graphics card right now. "
"231330","232970"," So hopefully you can see me."
"233030","234750"," I'm not, hopefully my camera doesn't go away today."
"235170","235930"," I had some freezing. "
"236450","240010"," You guys over the last time I was on, my stream was freezing up."
"242330","243870"," So I'm about having some issues, but whatever."
"244130","245150"," I think I've solved it at this point. "
"245650","248190"," I had to rebuild the new computer and all that kind of shit."
"248970","251870"," Now this morning, let's get started right away."
"251970","252130"," Okay. "
"252230","254030"," Let's just talk about, we have CPI this morning."
"255029","259250"," We've got the monthly over here, 1.1%. This is the estimate right."
"259470","262910"," Previously was 0.8%. You guys know most of this stuff, right?"
"263730","268150"," Of course, CPI, 0.5, 0.5. CPI year over year, 8.4, right?"
"268290","268530"," That's expectation. "
"270310","271990"," Now, there's a couple things going on."
"272070","273270"," We're going to talk about some macro stuff later."
"274250","276950"," We're going to talk about CPI real quick, but we're going to talk about some macro stuff this"
"276950","277210"," morning. "
"279210","281530"," And specifically what it means with CPI too."
"282110","284830"," So there's two things in play right now, right?"
"285310","288790"," We've got the market that's been selling off."
"290330","295790"," And the one key thing about, let me see if I can get a hold on here. "
"296550","299250"," One key thing about the market selling off is it's twofold, right?"
"299710","304730"," They're going to use headline news saying that the market's selling off due to the CPI"
"304730","305490"," anticipation."
"306150","307530"," CNBC was saying that early this morning."
"308130","308950"," Everybody's scared about CPI. "
"310430","314110"," And in reality, the market was kind of overbought."
"314450","315370"," I mean, that's the facts."
"316630","317550"," The market was overbought. "
"318710","320070"," And we'll take a look at that right now."
"320150","322850"," I'm going to load that up on another screen here just to show you that the market was overbought."
"323610","328450"," And there's no reason, because there's no real reason why the market shouldn't be selling off. "
"328850","330350"," And we're going to talk about some macro stuff today."
"330410","332890"," We're going to talk about how bad could the market get?"
"335550","339650"," If you have a negative viewpoint or a sideways viewpoint, we're going to talk about all that stuff"
"339650","342150"," some more even after CPI comes out this morning."
"342730","345570"," We're going to talk about where you should be buying, where you should be selling. "
"345710","349890"," We're talking about value stocks versus why you should actually be buying tech stock."
"351450","355450"," I'm going to explain a lot to you, because we've talked about this in the past, and how long you"
"355450","358430"," hold this stuff, and how the price doesn't actually matter."
"359090","361430"," The percentages matter, right?"
"361650","365590"," The money that's in the market, when the money's taken out of the market, where the price winds up,"
"365590","366470"," really doesn't fucking matter. "
"366770","368370"," Didn't matter in 2020 in March."
"368850","371390"," It doesn't matter for the past fucking two decades, three decades."
"371910","374750"," You can just look back in history and know when to buy and sell. "
"375350","378770"," And we already know that there's a general idea of where the market's going to be this year."
"379450","380570"," And they get that right, usually."
"381090","381970"," CNBC gets that right. "
"382310","383110"," Social media gets that right."
"383950","385210"," But there are places you should be buying."
"385790","387190"," There's places you should be taking profit. "
"387750","393270"," There's places that you should know where you should be taking profit, and then jump back in if we"
"393270","394850"," actually become bullish on the market."
"395450","396510"," So we're going to talk about that this morning."
"397870","402970"," And we're going to talk about why CPI to an extent doesn't matter. "
"403350","408110"," The only other thing I had with CPI this morning is that we have this big buildup to it."
"408810","412970"," And whether we sell off today or not, we're going to eventually sell off."
"413070","418150"," I'll show you that even if it's good today, we bounce up higher, and that will still sell off. "
"418390","420470"," It doesn't matter if it's today, tomorrow, next week."
"420650","421270"," There'll be a sell off."
"422330","427430"," And it's what normally happens in our market. "
"427590","430550"," Now, the price where the price winds up can change each time."
"431430","433670"," But this is a pretty regular thing that happens."
"434410","439190"," And this is when you should be buying and selling as following these indicators, right?"
"440250","441950"," Something I said, I pressed upon you guys out there. "
"442510","444990"," So you can kind of push away all the news that's out there."
"446190","450290"," Push away all the noise that you see in the market, and know when to buy and sell."
"450930","454570"," We're going to talk about how that impacts the next year in the markets. "
"455030","460510"," And whether we go down in the ball of ball flames, we go sideways, or if eventually we just go"
"460510","461350"," straight to the moon, right?"
"461490","462150"," It doesn't really matter."
"463830","468250"," Now, in terms of, so for this morning, we should have sold off."
"468870","470710"," And with this whole past week, we should have been selling off. "
"471590","472270"," And I'll show you why."
"473830","475230"," We'll hear this one."
"475330","476710"," But I'm going to go through some things with you, okay?"
"477190","478510"," Let's go through a spot cam report. "
"479350","480530"," I like their daily notes."
"480770","481370"," Pretty good."
"481870","485270"," Now, futures are holding yesterday's clothes currently near 4, 4,405. "
"486970","489410"," This is the off of overnight lows of 4,382."
"490270","492890"," When the highs are 44,112 or 12."
"494230","498630"," This move obviously foists a larger negative gamma position on markets, which expands our SPX"
"498630","501010"," volatility estimate to 1.2% percent. "
"501210","501510"," Pretty big."
"502150","503790"," Note that negative gamma is spying."
"504090","507510"," QQQ is quite large, which signals a more elevated volatility. "
"508290","515190"," Natural support is at 4,400, and then 43.10. Resistance shows at 44.20, which is right above,"
"515470","515470"," right?"
"516049","517230"," So we're in a squeeze type situation."
"517490","518850"," We're going to sell off hard."
"520090","521250"," We're going to squeeze higher. "
"522690","524270"," And we're going to talk about what I talked about yesterday."
"524370","527510"," We should get a squeeze my viewpoint is that we're going up."
"528030","530790"," And then we're going to bounce back and head of a head back down just like we did in December. "
"532150","538990"," Now, this sport is at 4,400, then 43.10. Resistance shows at 44.20, then 44.50. Traders will"
"538990","540570"," be watching 8-30CPI print."
"541250","543050"," This is price action I find seem to trigger put buyers."
"543930","549170"," This is mainly into the clothes, as our hero Delta ended readings were positive, neutral, and the 2"
"549170","550270"," PM Eastern Standard Time. "
"551810","554170"," Shumbalo is the change in SPX put open interest."
"555130","558930"," You can see that there were several out of the money puts picking up by greater than 10,000"
"558930","559230"," contracts."
"559930","567490"," We'd also know that 30,000 calls added to the 44.50 line, likely placing that strike in play on"
"567490","567870"," any rebound. "
"568950","571550"," So basically, there were playing strangles, right?"
"572130","575210"," Take a strangle on Friday, take another strangle yesterday into the clothes."
"575210","580730"," Matter of fact, it's a great, the clothes just should be a perfect place to take a strangle."
"581850","586410"," In regards to puts, you can see at the overall, put position is now driving larger in size, blows"
"586410","589390"," our Delta tilt reading, which we found effective for reading the lower bonds of markets. "
"590230","593310"," You can see that there was a bounce going side with the March 22, 22 lows."
"594670","597170"," And now we're re-approaching that lower bound level."
"597310","601370"," What equally interesting here is that the rise in the syndicate was through the closing of put"
"601370","604470"," positions with March Opex, not the addition of calls. "
"606330","610230"," Now, I think I posted on Twitter this week that you'll see 4,000."
"610430","611110"," I think you will."
"611530","614250"," I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility to see 4,000. "
"614850","615510"," We might not."
"615970","616830"," That's possibly don't."
"616970","618870"," We have the market breadth indicated. "
"619150","620990"," It'll tell us if we're gonna or not."
"621110","623150"," It really doesn't matter where we bought them out."
"623270","627710"," It doesn't matter where we bought them out at 430, 420, 410, fucking 400, 4,000 or whatever. "
"627890","628410"," It doesn't matter."
"629330","631990"," Material call buying has filled the manifest throughout the year."
"632150","633070"," We already know that, right?"
"633390","634830"," We already talked about that, right?"
"634950","639610"," We know that people stop buying calls once they start getting higher, 8, 450, 4, 60, anywhere,"
"639750","639790"," neither. "
"640250","641330"," We're like, fuck this, I'm out of here."
"641610","647130"," I'm taking my gains and I'll wait for the next drop for me to go long again until I see"
"647130","648690"," something higher the banks do."
"649050","650990"," Material call buying has filled the manifest throughout the year. "
"651070","653390"," This is the market being driven by the flow of put options."
"654050","656670"," Entirely different from the call heavy trading in the past two years."
"657130","657770"," We already know that. "
"657870","659930"," We've known that since November, right?"
"659930","663550"," Put controlled markets are characterized by high volatility as dealers must hedge in the markets"
"663550","664570"," prevailing direction."
"665310","669350"," Put flow is likely to remain higher than that of calls until the macro landscape is clear."
"669850","675170"," This is a key point right here because this really does involve the markets. "
"675730","680010"," You fucking hate seeing me see hate Twitter and fucking Reddit and all other shit."
"680450","684370"," Stock twits, but there is a general feeling in the market that is truthful, right?"
"684530","687950"," You know the last couple of years that the market was going up, generally speaking."
"687950","693250"," You know that there's there's a neutral trade to slightly downtrade at minimum of the market. "
"693910","698350"," For the release, let's call it the first three quarters of the year, right?"
"698490","699230"," You could say it's sideways."
"699750","700550"," You can say whatever it is."
"700690","702230"," We're down below all time highs. "
"702670","703790"," We're not getting near it right now."
"704890","707370"," So we know that, but you got to understand that."
"707510","708090"," We know that, right?"
"709050","711010"," This is going to lead us into a conversation later this morning. "
"711430","713410"," Our purpose here is to monitor the options of market volatility."
"714250","717330"," Last week, we discussed why we're concerned about the move in credit markets."
"717330","723790"," So as you can see here, the move index AKA bond VIX continues to press near March 20 highs. "
"724010","725570"," The VIX remains well below 22 highs."
"725950","726710"," We'll talk about that somewhere."
"726850","729690"," I haven't talked much about this on Twitter. "
"731450","733450"," We'll talk about that at some point today as well."
"733730","734770"," If any of you don't know what that means."
"735190","737390"," There's now been a 15% drawdown in treasury futures. "
"738130","740770"," Something that has happened only twice before since 1990."
"741210","745830"," We think that this likely pressures the estimated greater than 500 billion in risk parity of all"
"745830","746690"," trading strategies."
"747230","754090"," This is interesting too because we'll look at a story that was written last week that was commented"
"754090","758030"," upon where some banks are stuck in buying vol too. "
"758550","762570"," It hasn't been talked about in the news much and no one's commenting on it."
"762630","763410"," No one's talking about it."
"763730","764630"," We'll talk about that later. "
"765330","767490"," It's something that no one's had no one has on Twitter that I've seen."
"768190","770630"," These are complicated waters to navigate and it's such worth thankfully."
"770950","772450"," Thankfully rely on model driven forecasts. "
"772870","774210"," It's something about flows and not narratives."
"774930","778650"," As such, it's just that until the market recovers, the vol trigger 44.75, right?"
"779130","781730"," You know about that, a volatility trigger, negative volatility positive."
"783270","787270"," That volatility trigger negative gamma positive gamma. "
"787710","788630"," Let's say it's differently."
"788950","790750"," It really isn't really positive and negative either."
"791690","793770"," Then put flows in high volatility to continue to dominate. "
"793950","797390"," That's basically saying if we stay below 44.75, expect volatility."
"798410","799770"," Expect wild swings in the market."
"800250","801570"," Expect to sell every rip. "
"802350","808190"," Even if we're heading higher towards it, be expecting to sell those rips until we get above 44.75."
"808370","810950"," Then when we start heading up there, you wouldn't expect to sell rips."
"811070","811890"," Are we looking to buy dips?"
"813110","815090"," I'll scroll through this right here for you right now."
"816990","820790"," I've been posting this chart for the past week I think, or at least since I stopped live streaming. "
"821930","825550"," I'm going to show you, this is that chart I guess for today."
"828030","831130"," We started rolling over back here on 329."
"831850","833770"," I'm going to show you another chart real quick here. "
"834430","835170"," Bring this one up here."
"835950","836670"," We've got what?"
"836990","837490"," Eight minutes left."
"838270","840330"," I just want to show you this real quick here. "
"841270","843510"," I think it's nonsense that I put it over here."
"843970","846710"," I do want you to see this here because it's the 29th of March."
"847270","848230"," This is the market breadth indicator. "
"850110","851730"," You can see this over here."
"852050","853650"," See it coincides perfectly right."
"854030","856190"," You can see we came up into the sell zone above here. "
"856710","858390"," This is just normal."
"859190","862610"," Take profit, take money off the table, watch it roll over."
"863010","864830"," It happens all the time as that point. "
"865730","867110"," We're starting to get lower down here."
"868290","871310"," We're starting to get really negative actually, which is good."
"872930","880730"," This number over here, 601.3. You can see 4.6.8. The market should continue to roll over here. "
"880990","882230"," We have a little snap up today."
"882630","888670"," If that's not out of their own possibly, the shorts cover, we go higher and then we continue to"
"888670","892750"," sell down until we get to one of these buy triggers down here."
"893030","894050"," This happens frequently. "
"894470","895290"," It happens all the time."
"895890","899710"," What happens here, happens here, happens over here, and here, happens over here, here, here."
"899950","906210"," Notice that the market can go up while we hit those capitulation, those little market liquidation"
"906210","906490"," moments. "
"906930","910210"," Notice that we go down, hit those liquidation moments."
"910750","919750"," Even notice back here in March, believe it or not here in March, we had one right here, right down"
"919750","920010"," here."
"920430","923530"," We actually went back up to this point right here again. "
"924330","925450"," We had another liquidation moment."
"926430","927430"," We went back up again."
"928090","929550"," It's not like this doesn't happen. "
"930130","930510"," It's common."
"930850","936250"," We'll know previously where they are, where the sells and the buys are."
"936710","938950"," We know when it starts to get risky is up here, right?"
"939450","943490"," We know that we don't need to capture the entire buy, so we already know that stuff. "
"943850","946910"," We already know that we should have expected some sort of market rollover."
"947070","952170"," We're going to talk about the difference too in value stocks and S&P 500 and why is tech selling"
"952170","957610"," off so much and how it doesn't really fucking matter later on this morning."
"957770","960670"," But so we're looking for this, right, capitulation move at some point. "
"960870","966810"," Even if we squeeze our today, we're going to still look for market liquidation because it happens,"
"967370","967850"," okay?"
"968150","968950"," It just happens."
"970010","971050"," So we're going to get rid of this one."
"971270","974690"," Go back to this chart right here and I want you guys, if you guys don't have this on your"
"974690","979030"," charting at home, here is your support two down here, 431, right?"
"979150","982490"," This is the JPM call over here at 434, right?"
"982770","990950"," S1, support one is 440 and then R1 up here is at 442 and then 445 is R2 resistance, right?"
"991290","992530"," And that's kind of the point, right?"
"992750","998430"," Is the kind of the point is that I was saying, I was saying yesterday, I was saying, look back"
"998430","999250"," in December, right?"
"999630","1005030"," We had something like this happen, I think, and then it snapped even higher and then we shot down"
"1005030","1009410"," and got that capitulation move and it gives bears a chance to get a better positioning. "
"1010070","1015430"," You might get one today and you might get another one tomorrow or Thursday or Friday or not Friday,"
"1015610","1020590"," we're closed on Friday for Easter, but somewhere in here is where I'm actually looking to take my"
"1020590","1021030"," next short."
"1022110","1023990"," Now, I think this is guaranteed, no."
"1024470","1033550"," But do I think that we've fucking come down so far in anticipation of the CPI print that it really"
"1033550","1034410"," better be fucking bad. "
"1034569","1040170"," It better be like fucking 10, 12, 14 for us to start selling down."
"1041130","1043410"," And why do you care even if we do begin to sell down?"
"1044609","1048610"," Because in reality, you're just looking for that place to buy that dip down here, okay?"
"1049370","1052970"," You're looking for that next dip to buy when we're in oversold conditions so you can take it long."
"1053710","1055330"," Okay, that's really what you're looking for. "
"1055430","1056690"," Look at that, it looks like cock and balls already."
"1056810","1059670"," I'm already starting with the cock and the balls in the first thing in the morning here."
"1060090","1062110"," Look at that, bam, cock and balls. "
"1062730","1063450"," I shouldn't have done that."
"1064830","1066510"," But this is what your setup is for today."
"1067130","1068470"," And this is what I think is going to happen. "
"1068470","1071810"," I think you're going to get some panic, a panic rip higher."
"1072370","1077150"," I think even if the CPI print is we'll talk about CPI later and inflation later because I'm dealing"
"1077150","1077890"," with it right now."
"1078210","1078730"," It's about a house. "
"1078730","1079450"," I'm dealing with it."
"1079970","1080750"," It's a 26."
"1081650","1084310"," I'll turn on trade the news real quick. "
"1085070","1089870"," And so we can, well, I think we'll get the CPI print before Twitter does."
"1090130","1094310"," Matter of fact, I know we do or most most of the time we get your listening to trade."
"1094630","1095290"," I'll turn this on. "
"1095290","1096070"," Let me make sure."
"1096230","1098270"," Tell me if you guys can hear this out there."
"1098350","1099050"," I'm going to do a test. "
"1099470","1103210"," I'm working properly and you are now ready to listen to our other voice channel."
"1103550","1109910"," If the audio is not broadcast quality, it's not clear or it's choppy, please read over our support"
"1109910","1118170"," page at www.tradethenews.com slash help dot for a list of common sound tests."
"1119890","1121110"," Yeah, I'm not hearing it either. "
"1121350","1122110"," I'm not doing nothing."
"1122330","1125730"," This is the data for more jobs there."
"1125870","1126530"," It's got a year per year. "
"1126690","1128110"," It's seen 8.4 percent."
"1128530","1130050"," It's about your price from 7.9 percent."
"1130250","1130550"," I'll do it. "
"1130670","1131330"," I'll do it."
"1131450","1132010"," I'll turn it on."
"1132030","1133290"," I'll turn it on somewhere else here. "
"1134470","1135270"," I'll listen to it."
"1135490","1135690"," I'll listen to it."
"1136630","1137690"," I'll listen to it. "
"1137810","1140990"," I'll listen to it in the background and I'll read it to you."
"1141070","1141210"," Listen."
"1141450","1143810"," I'll say it to you guys. "
"1144270","1145270"," Oh, you know what I could do here?"
"1145270","1146270"," We're just a second."
"1146470","1147510"," Hold on one second here."
"1147570","1148390"," Desktop audio. "
"1149490","1150750"," You know, treat the news."
"1151810","1152710"," We got three minutes left."
"1155040","1155740"," Treat the news. "
"1156060","1157660"," You're listening to trade the news."
"1157660","1160000"," I think you can do this desktop audio."
"1161360","1162960"," Microphone desktop audio. "
"1166680","1167120"," Properties."
"1167120","1167560"," Monitor."
"1169080","1169480"," Don't put. "
"1169900","1170560"," That might work."
"1170740","1172300"," Let me see this works."
"1176070","1176830"," Let's see if we can hear it. "
"1176830","1179370"," You're listening to trade the news."
"1181390","1183150"," Alright, so we'll fuck that."
"1183370","1186890"," What we're going to do is we're going to turn that up. "
"1187670","1189250"," I don't know why I'm not getting the audio."
"1189630","1191490"," Desktop audio is not flying for me."
"1192050","1193570"," I had to really do this whole entire thing. "
"1193710","1200570"," So I'm going to turn it on over here and I'll listen to it in the background and to fight"
"1200570","1201350"," whatever I hear."
"1213070","1215030"," Okay, so I've got it on the background over here."
"1215270","1217550"," We've got two minutes left until CPI print comes out. "
"1217950","1220730"," The moment that it comes out, I'll say it to you guys."
"1221330","1228030"," If you are first time joining us, if there's any kind of a delay in your stream, go down to"
"1228030","1230350"," the little icon down below and you can speed up the stream."
"1238220","1242440"," So if you're tuning in the first time and you want the live stream to be, you know, within a"
"1242440","1248240"," few seconds, just speed up the live stream right now and a little hamburger, a little box on"
"1248240","1248420"," YouTube. "
"1248680","1251340"," You can speed it up and it'll eventually go to real time."
"1252840","1256380"," YouTube slows down live streams, but you can actually catch right up to it."
"1256440","1260940"," It's like, so it's like a two second delay, five second delay and you'll have this, you'll have"
"1260940","1264600"," this quicker than, let me close that over there. "
"1265560","1269460"," You'll have this faster than, well, isn't that beautiful?"
"1269740","1269980"," Look at that."
"1270720","1271020"," Gorgeous."
"1273560","1274640"," Can I bring that right over there?"
"1276400","1278060"," Just a few seconds for CPI data. "
"1282840","1283940"," Should I go to the one minute?"
"1284180","1285400"," We'll get all crazy with it."
"1285400","1286300"," Oh, yeah, look at that."
"1286460","1286920"," The one minute. "
"1287180","1288980"," Oh, baby."
"1291050","1300440"," 8.5% for CPI in line,"
"1303380","1304660"," lower than expected."
"1304700","1306160"," Holy shit, baby. "
"1307080","1312640"," In line and lower than expected."
"1313700","1314560"," Bears are fucked."
"1317500","1318680"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"1318920","1320020"," Wait a minute, wait a minute."
"1320480","1321780"," Hold on a second here."
"1328420","1335700"," Smart CPI, 1.2% versus 1.2% expected, year over year, 8.5% versus 8.4%"
"1335700","1336200"," expected. "
"1336300","1343440"," CPI excluding food and energy, month over month, 0.3% versus 0.5% year over year, 6.5 "
"1343440","1351580","% versus 6.6%. CPI index NSA 287.5 versus 287.4 expected."
"1352200","1359480"," CPI core index SSA number versus 289.2E. So that's actually not bad."
"1360300","1362740"," That is way in line. "
"1363080","1364700"," Way, way, way in line."
"1376530","1377990"," Winky, I didn't see you in here, brother."
"1378090","1378850"," Good to see you, my man. "
"1380850","1382310"," Good morning, Winky."
"1383770","1386310"," Yeah, so is that a bad CPI number?"
"1394110","1400470"," Noticable down tick in sales of cars or in use car pricing is going down."
"1401130","1404270"," That's a note along with CPI data. "
"1407200","1411900"," Noticable down tick, which is positive for inflation going down."
"1412720","1414720"," Don't forget we also have Biden speaking today."
"1414860","1419360"," I think it's at 2.30 this afternoon talking about price controls of some kind. "
"1421400","1423820"," So CPI, right?"
"1425280","1426320"," Not bad."
"1426980","1428820"," Bad, but not bad."
"1429300","1429700"," Could be worse. "
"1437310","1438750"," Let me give you a second here."
"1442160","1443220"," So CPI data."
"1444660","1447660"," In line and slightly better. "
"1449520","1456320"," When it's going to come off and it's bad, of course, but that that inflation is actually coming"
"1456320","1461180"," down in some pockets of the United States that we're seeing."
"1462880","1468580"," This is an interesting one too because I wanted to talk about that some we're going to do a macro"
"1468580","1475920"," talk today about the oil trade that everyone's talking about may not be there if GDP is going to"
"1475920","1476460"," come down."
"1476960","1483260"," We're not the same situation as we have been like all the pieces to the puzzle to a recession are"
"1483260","1492960"," not exactly where they're not all in place because because of how abnormal 2020 was March 2020 and"
"1492960","1493620"," what happened. "
"1494980","1496460"," So we are trading higher."
"1496620","1504080"," We're not we're not trading at 443.05 just slightly higher than the close yesterday at 4.39 87."
"1504720","1507400"," We know that resistance above is at 4.44 86. "
"1508360","1513560"," We'll see if shorts begin to close at some point or if we or if we come back down over"
"1513560","1518820"," here, maybe shorts try to unfuck themselves if they can this morning so that we can trade higher."
"1519060","1520660"," How high do we trade here?"
"1520900","1522620"," What's the top here today, right?"
"1523120","1525320"," And this kind of looks right like right 445."
"1526080","1530080"," We could possibly squeeze higher today to this upper bound of 450. "
"1530920","1536140"," We could squeeze higher and I would still expect some sort of a rollover at some point or trade"
"1536140","1542000"," sideways into the of course the earning season that's going to begin."
"1542320","1551500"," But surely this morning anyone out there that is that's right and flake my QQQ and TLT calls your"
"1551500","1551980"," boomer."
"1552320","1553180"," Good to see you. "
"1554460","1558340"," How is that TLT doing right now at this moment?"
"1558580","1561020"," I think I was talking about TLT all week long."
"1561260","1562420"," I've been talking to the TLT."
"1562520","1563380"," Oh yeah. "
"1564100","1565080"," Oh baby."
"1565080","1568460"," Look at that TLT with that with that turn, baby."
"1568920","1573300"," Look at that TLT turn with that little TLT bump over there. "
"1574040","1574800"," TLT bulls."
"1576360","1577220"," TLT bulls."
"1577900","1580040"," We're going to talk about, we have a bunch to talk about this morning. "
"1580800","1586140"," In fact, I'm going to turn on the, give me just a moment here because I'm going to turn on"
"1586840","1587740"," what's that thing called."
"1588420","1593240"," I got my computer here so I can turn on what the fuck am I doing here?"
"1593340","1597500"," I'm going to put on Discord so I can get flow out, flow into Discord today."
"1597880","1599020"," I've been here. "
"1602160","1605980"," I immediately logged into Discord."
"1606320","1610520"," So I bought a house and I had priced the house out."
"1613360","1616000"," I'd priced the house out to rehab it. "
"1616740","1618720"," It's part of my retirement, right?"
"1618840","1622520"," I want to keep this home and use it for money."
"1626220","1627140"," Hold on here."
"1627220","1627800"," Give me just a second. "
"1628360","1637180"," And originally I'd priced out, I think my, my, my original last one was like $50,000 for rehab and"
"1637180","1638380"," that was me doing the rehab."
"1639280","1641260"," Personalized receiver, server settings."
"1642460","1643220"," Am I doing wrong here?"
"1644220","1647560"," And I'm now, then I thought it was at 70 or $80,000. "
"1648460","1649760"," I'm closer to 100."
"1650580","1651540"," We'll talk about that later."
"1652220","1653500"," We'll do a macro discussion. "
"1654920","1660920"," And what's crazy is that, okay, so I'm in there and I'm going to do a screener."
"1663030","1664450"," I'm going to use that screener."
"1665670","1666190"," 1080p. "
"1669320","1669520"," Okay."
"1670960","1673400"," Looks like Discord is I'm taking input for your mic."
"1673580","1674200"," Let's fix that. "
"1675200","1676340"," Okay, my microphone."
"1679960","1681360"," Microphone privacy settings."
"1683910","1684290"," Hello, apps. "
"1685850","1686250"," Okay."
"1686950","1687750"," Let's see if that works."
"1687750","1689070"," Maybe you can hear my mic now. "
"1689170","1689330"," Okay."
"1693270","1700120"," Anyways, it's kind of weird because how this impacts, you know, when you guys actually see the"
"1700120","1703920"," economy go down, you always think it's going to be the janitor that gets fired and it's not."
"1704060","1710740"," It's always the highest priced employees that get fired or downsized. "
"1711840","1717320"," And so that's what I've had skilled labor."
"1717600","1723400"," I've had to take on myself from GCing the project to I just did a bunch of electrical work."
"1723400","1727760"," First, I put a box in now I'm running electric to the house and then I'm doing all this plumbing"
"1727760","1735840"," stuff and running a roofing crew and all this other nonsense, which I didn't anticipate doing. "
"1736100","1742720"," But I'm doing it because I'm literally it's going to put me behind like 30 to $40,000 and I"
"1742720","1744460"," don't I'm so cheap right now."
"1745700","1754020"," So I'm I'm taking on this work right now that I wasn't didn't want to do get a little bit"
"1754020","1756580"," a little bit of a sell selling down a little bit."
"1756960","1762020"," I would have a bump up here 443 45 not too bad. "
"1763200","1764460"," We'll see how the open goes."
"1764640","1765700"," Let me know in the comments real quick."
"1766040","1767660"," Oh, and Joe Harper. "
"1768780","1769800"," Joe Harper."
"1770180","1772300"," I apologize for not calling you yesterday, Joe Harper."
"1772540","1774140"," I can't find my fucking phone. "
"1775080","1776060"," Hold on one second though."
"1776200","1776400"," Hold on."
"1776480","1783660"," I got some hold on one second. "
"1785910","1792430"," I got some hold on one second here because I haven't opened it."
"1793210","1794110"," But it's here."
"1799720","1800540"," Hold on one second. "
"1817430","1817810"," All right."
"1819590","1820830"," Joey Harper, you in here?"
"1823520","1825220"," Yeah, so I hired contractors."
"1825840","1826380"," I hired subs. "
"1827260","1827960"," So I flipped houses."
"1828680","1829900"," So I'm like, oh, not evil."
"1831080","1832640"," We've had this conversation before. "
"1833600","1836080"," But this is a hustle I'm keeping."
"1838160","1839560"," The GCI didn't hire."
"1840820","1846300"," I've hired subs, but I'm doing like the made the majority of it. "
"1846300","1851800"," The difficult stuff for the running of it right now, because it's just not my budget."
"1852080","1854220"," That's just not what it is in the budget."
"1854220","1856140"," I could pay the money to have it done. "
"1856260","1863860"," But the my ROI on it, if we go into a recession the next couple of years, I can get"
"1863860","1864240"," stuck."
"1864940","1865560"," So hold on."
"1865680","1867020"," So let's go back here. "
"1868160","1872490"," Can I let's just delete that."
"1873330","1874310"," How do I delete that?"
"1874470","1874710"," Okay."
"1874950","1878580"," Oh, yeah. "
"1881580","1882120"," Is that you, Joe?"
"1883620","1885460"," Joe Harper sent me something in the mail."
"1887560","1890220"," This from an old sailboat from I believe South America."
"1890440","1892700"," Now I haven't read the I haven't read the note yet either, Joe. "
"1895850","1905000"," But Joe Harper, he he what he does is he's got a shop at his house"
"1905000","1911680"," and he took a piece of timber from a sale selling vessel."
"1913380","1915360"," We'll we'll we'll call it a selling vessel."
"1915600","1917540"," I don't know if it's a fishing vessel or selling vessel. "
"1918340","1923620"," And he turned it, I believe on a lathe and on a yeah, I don't know."
"1923680","1927800"," I don't know what he did with this, but I'm just going to put up to the camera so you"
"1927800","1928360"," can see it."
"1930560","1931060"," Oh, yeah. "
"1931260","1931680"," Look at that."
"1932540","1934160"," What's the little magnum in the back here?"
"1936020","1937360"," Beautiful, beautiful dust pen."
"1938100","1940800"," So nice little box and I haven't read the note yet. "
"1942060","1946520"," So I'm not going to read that publicly, but I'll I'll keep this for later."
"1947820","1952900"," And I haven't used the pen yet either, but this is this is staying on the desk."
"1955530","1957270"," And I'm going to give you a call later today. "
"1957570","1961190"," I have well, I have to I try to seek out the phone and I couldn't find it."
"1963170","1964670"," So I've got it right here, Joe."
"1965350","1966770"," Thank you very much, my brother. "
"1973590","1978790"," So I think I have to do is think I have to I have to kind of I have to"
"1978790","1984050"," work this into a pen pen holder of some kind piece of wood."
"1984330","1994220"," So I'm a little beside myself over this for my shipwreck and coaster week of"
"1994220","1994460"," baby."
"2001290","2003230"," Yeah, I apologize for the microphone in this morning. "
"2003610","2004350"," It's all fucked up."
"2007670","2008870"," Now let's talk about it up."
"2009550","2010750"," Let's talk about some so here we go. "
"2010750","2011210"," We're going up, right?"
"2012530","2015630"," Do you guys close your puts of clothes yesterday and open your calls?"
"2017050","2018330"," Did you guys do that yesterday?"
"2018510","2020270"," Do you guys follow along with that trade yesterday?"
"2022660","2023040"," Isn't that beautiful?"
"2024700","2025600"," Pretty pretty rad."
"2035350","2036690"," Let's go back down over here."
"2038130","2039250"," Make me small again. "
"2040790","2043670"," Okay, so we are trading higher at this point."
"2043770","2044810"," We're going to talk about some stuff there."
"2044830","2045850"," We're going to talk about some macro stuff. "
"2048150","2049670"," And we got a bunch to talk about."
"2049929","2053290"," So first of all, so it's only 842."
"2053610","2055110"," You can tune out if you want now. "
"2056150","2058170"," We're going to talk about the channel."
"2058550","2064610"," And then we're going to talk about some macro stuff I need you guys to see."
"2071360","2076300"," I'm going to try to put firstly, just see if I can put trade the news back on over here"
"2076860","2078520"," and see if you guys can hear it at least. "

"2141470","2142630"," I don't know why that is. "

"2153820","2154160"," No idea."

"2163570","2164090"," Yeah, good. "

"2165210","2165790"," That's a reminder."
"2166050","2166610"," We could see the event. "
"2166610","2166670"," Okay."
"2166810","2167850"," So I can't hear it."
"2167850","2168330"," You guys can. "
"2168710","2169550"," So I'm going to miss."
"2169910","2171410"," I'm going to miss them this today."
"2171670","2172610"," I don't know why I can't hear it. "
"2172610","2174770"," It really stands in 4.2 million barrels per day."
"2175410","2176910"," I don't know if I can see if I can."
"2180300","2180700"," Yeah. "
"2180740","2182940"," For some weird reason, I can't hear trade the news."
"2187570","2195370"," Backwell, when they cut their 22 oil demand by 14,000 barrels per day, so cutting 22 oil demand."
"2195870","2200110"," I'm having, well, first of all, I'm having issues with, oh, shit. "
"2200750","2201950"," Hold on one second here."
"2216920","2220500"," I'm about to run as I said, plug in a laptop this morning."
"2223480","2229600"," So I'm having issues on my own hardware and I was having issues with my stream. "
"2230400","2233840"," So now on to a new graphics card."
"2234940","2235940"," Lots of frustration."
"2236900","2243800"," And then I went through, and I've been, I think I've gone through OBS five or six times and I"
"2243800","2247820"," eventually found out that consequences themselves. "
"2247920","2254180"," I had my, my camera setting to a large format."
"2254460","2255560"," Can you possibly get that?"
"2255800","2262700"," The charger couldn't say rush the economy will adapt to the situation and plug in this solution for"
"2262700","2263980"," the economy is to cut bureaucracy."
"2265540","2272630"," So I'm putting out this large format. "
"2274230","2278670"," I'm putting out this large format video of just my face right to my desktop."
"2280250","2286270"," And it's crashing the computer and I didn't, I didn't know what it was that."
"2286410","2287870"," I thought I was the things I'm working on. "
"2288130","2292450"," So I'm having all this frustration trying to get ready, get on, stream every, every morning."
"2292450","2293730"," It's just frustrating, frustrating."
"2294390","2297350"," And I don't think that's plugged in if it's not showing that it's plugged in. "
"2309560","2314700"," So I have to, anyways, a lot of, it's a lot of work to get the production side of this"
"2314700","2317400"," out and I'm like frustrated."
"2319820","2324820"," So in that, inside of that frustration, I have some, some other stuff that I'm doing on the side,"
"2324820","2326800"," of course, that's absorbing my time."
"2327460","2334100"," And so it's just been very frustrating to frustrating to have all of this going on. "
"2334200","2338860"," I've got a way, we have children and all of this stuff's going on."
"2338960","2341120"," So that's the parallel side for right now."
"2341720","2343620"," I'm going to try to get here with you every day. "
"2343980","2349660"," I did want to tell you though that the house that I bought, I am building a studio in the"
"2349660","2357540"," basement right there or like a, kind of like a, like a temporary studio so that I can live stream"
"2357540","2359960"," from there every day."
"2360240","2361400"," So I have to be there every day."
"2362320","2368200"," And you guys, I'll be able to be there and take breaks and talk to the guys that are working"
"2368200","2373940"," so that I can be on live stream day in, day out. "
"2374220","2379920"," So the crazy part is I have to, I'm working on a room in a base in the basement."
"2380740","2385000"," So that's to look like a, like a studio can't look like a, like a, it's like the back room"
"2385000","2385480"," in this basement."
"2386340","2389760"," But I need, I need that space there and I need to be soundproofed. "
"2389760","2396320"," I need the walls and I had to run an electricity to put power and all of those stuff, but"
"2396320","2396520"," whatever."
"2397220","2401140"," So over the course and this weekend or next weekend, I'll have a studio set up."
"2402020","2408400"," You'll see this room change and I'll be moving over there so that I can live stream with you guys. "
"2408560","2415600"," Another thing that is that I was supposed to take vacation to for some sailing and I had to cancel"
"2415600","2418100"," that because of where I'm at with this house."
"2418480","2425280"," I am committed to getting this done or see my wife has me committed to getting this done because I"
"2425280","2427260"," can't let her down."
"2428960","2430860"," So right now that's that's what the plan is. "
"2431000","2431860"," Okay, now we're going to talk."
"2432200","2433960"," So all that shits aside for right now."
"2434220","2436740"," Let's get into the meat of meat and potatoes of this. "
"2436740","2438040"," Okay, and we're going to talk about here."
"2438940","2440560"," Now I want to talk to you guys about something."
"2440660","2443400"," We're going to go right back to, we're going to, we're going to go right back to this chair right"
"2443400","2443520"," here. "
"2446020","2453300"," And I want to talk to you first about, I want to talk to you specifically about, we're going to"
"2453300","2454480"," get rid of this for right now."
"2456500","2458420"," Matter of fact, we'll just clear this whole entire fucking thing."
"2458820","2462380"," All you know we'll do, we'll go to SPX. "
"2463580","2465180"," Yeah, we'll look at SPX."
"2465380","2466000"," SPX pretty good."
"2466480","2467700"," SPX goes back a long time. "
"2467860","2469900"," We're going to look at SPX."
"2470700","2471800"," It's a good one to look at."
"2471800","2472440"," With macro indicators. "
"2473040","2473480"," We'll go to all."
"2473860","2475440"," Well, that's probably not a good one to look at, right?"
"2475820","2477300"," It's a pretty good one to be looking at."
"2478040","2479020"," We'll look at SPX. "
"2480440","2481760"," It's an important one to look at."
"2482220","2488800"," And we're going to talk to you about this because on a macro, the macro side of things, you"
"2488800","2494720"," generally understand that the market, that the market is weak right now."
"2495020","2495480"," It's neutral. "
"2496460","2499820"," Let's call it neutral at best, maybe slightly down, right?"
"2502820","2506340"," And you know, it's interesting."
"2506620","2512890"," You can look at, are you the interesting one to look at would be, let's see if I can go"
"2512890","2514090"," one year."
"2518770","2519790"," This is actually pretty neat. "
"2520030","2521870"," Let's just say, look at how horrible this is, right?"
"2521950","2522350"," This is 2020."
"2527600","2531000"," And you've got this progression of lower lows, right?"
"2531220","2532200"," One, two, and three."
"2532320","2533320"," This is pretty nasty, right?"
"2533520","2534360"," Going back to 2018. "
"2534360","2537120"," It's pretty nasty drop off in the market."
"2538060","2540340"," And we'll look back at 1994 and some other times too."
"2541160","2545880"," But I want to show you, the point I'm trying to make to you is this is that if we're"
"2545880","2551060"," going to trade down or sideways, let's say we do that, let's say at a base level, we're going to"
"2551060","2553680"," do that for the first three quarters of the year. "
"2555300","2556620"," Let's say it kind of looks like this."
"2556860","2557700"," This isn't good, right?"
"2557820","2559040"," This is pretty, this is bearish, right?"
"2560100","2565380"," Let's say we don't even get, let's say we don't even get higher than, then I can show you some"
"2565380","2566560"," other time in history."
"2566680","2567740"," We don't get any higher than right here. "
"2567760","2568880"," We don't even get this climb up."
"2569380","2570580"," This is one year right here."
"2571320","2574580"," And every time we get close to making all-time highs, we sell it off. "
"2575480","2576640"," And we keep selling it off."
"2578660","2580220"," There's a couple of things I want to talk to you about."
"2580560","2586500"," And first of all is that if you, if there's a general idea that the market's going to continue to"
"2586500","2591760"," sell down to lower lows, that you can look for these lower lows now for the rest of this year,"
"2592060","2592060"," right?"
"2592660","2597740"," To buy a low, trade it higher, and then once we're oversold, take your money and run. "
"2599440","2606000"," Now, how would you know, how would you know if, let's say you're like, hey cap, well, I don't know,"
"2606880","2610100"," let's say you're like, hey cap, let's say you're buying these lows, right?"
"2610300","2614180"," You trade them up, you buy the lows, you trade them up, just pay them, we sold this down, right?"
"2615260","2617860"," We trade it up again, we sell it down to something nasty, right?"
"2618820","2622080"," And the reality is that you just take your profit, right?"
"2622400","2625900"," Take your profit, take your profit in that regime, right?"
"2626640","2629580"," And let's say we sell down here, right?"
"2629960","2633720"," And the oversold indicator pops up, the price doesn't actually matter."
"2634160","2637520"," You'll see an oversold indicator here, and you'll see it actually down here as well."
"2637980","2641640"," And then we'll start trading higher, and you'll get an indication that we're going to trade higher"
"2641640","2643440"," from here, as I point. "
"2643720","2648380"," You don't need this part of the trade, but to get, to capture this part of the trade is worth"
"2648380","2652800"," it, to capture this part of the trade right here is worth it, and this part of the trade right"
"2652800","2653580"," here is worth it."
"2654340","2658500"," But this up here isn't, if you're a bull, right?"
"2658760","2663540"," You don't need all this, you just need to be able to, you just need to be buying this, this"
"2663540","2664540"," year, right?"
"2664780","2665100"," And selling."
"2665700","2669920"," And if we are going to trade higher, we'll have indicators that show us that we're going to trade"
"2669920","2670420"," higher here. "
"2670900","2671640"," We're going to get confirmation."
"2672440","2676700"," This area here though, you don't need to, you don't need this money, you just don't need it."
"2677720","2682620"," And what I want to explain about this right here too, I'm going to show you some overlays, some"
"2682620","2684040"," comparisons here. "
"2684600","2688700"," And this is the trap that Jim Kramer was talking about."
"2688760","2695340"," Jim Kramer is telling you to go buy value, go buy fucking oil, go buy, which is odd too, because"
"2695340","2699220"," this is where different, the other thing about oil is, I'm going to overlay oil and show you when"
"2699220","2703020"," oil is done better than the stock market, because we're coming into that confluence right now in"
"2703020","2709360"," oil, where the S&P 500 could roll over and oil could continue to go higher here, believe it or"
"2709360","2709540"," not."
"2710060","2713080"," You could see, or in past years, we've had that. "
"2713200","2718080"," The one problem that we have right now with oil is that, so in the past, right, we've had moments"
"2718080","2721300"," like this where the S&P sells off and oil continues higher."
"2722100","2727800"," Now the one, the one problem with this, right, is fucking the real GDP, right?"
"2728060","2732280"," The expectations and the Ford guidance on GDP is that it's going down."
"2733600","2742240"," And in previous decades, when oil has done better than the S&P 500, real GDP actually went above"
"2742240","2745820"," and kept going higher, and it's not projected to do that right now. "
"2746020","2747420"," So there's a difference there too."
"2747720","2752280"," So I'm not sold on buying oil right now to believe it or not, unless something changes in GDP."
"2753040","2754260"," I'm not seeing that oil trade. "
"2754780","2759240"," And when Jim Kramer is telling you to buy value stocks and go buy fucking home depot and go buy"
"2759240","2760720"," all this other stuff, it's a trap."
"2761460","2764680"," And I'm going to explain to you why it's, I'm going to show you why it's a trap right now."
"2766020","2768200"," And what I'm going to show you is NDX. "
"2768520","2774260"," I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you small caps, right, I'll show you RTY or the RUT."
"2775320","2780380"," And with some value, what are some of the value ETFs, right?"
"2781800","2787060"," Value ETFs, we'll look at Vanguard, I figure out it's called VTU or something value value."
"2788260","2794820"," We'll look at VTV. "
"2795160","2795840"," It's a good one to compare."
"2797920","2798240"," Right."
"2798400","2801180"," We'll look at a USO, right?"
"2801400","2802100"," That's an ETF, right?"
"2802240","2803640"," United States, old fund, oil fund. "
"2804180","2805360"," We'll throw some of these on here."
"2805520","2806340"," It's SPX, right?"
"2808400","2814680"," And I'm going to show you NDX or I want to show what you can see here over the course"
"2814680","2821680"," of, I want to show you something here, okay?"
"2823200","2824960"," So this is what's important, okay?"
"2825040","2825700"," This is 2018."
"2825940","2827240"," We can take it back as far as you want. "
"2827320","2828960"," We can go as far as you want back here, okay?"
"2831100","2836460"," And the key that I want to show you is this is, you look at VTV back here, I don't"
"2836460","2837200"," know if that one was correct."
"2838280","2839900"," I think I might have got the wrong one there."
"2840320","2840980"," Yeah, it's VTV. "
"2841320","2848340"," So the key that I'm trying to say to you was this is that, you know, you saw the headline"
"2848340","2852860"," headline news that said, NASDAQ lost $1 trillion again."
"2854970","2858670"," And so what you are going to experience in sell-offs, right?"
"2858970","2860510"," Let's say we have a bearish year."
"2861250","2868510"," You're going to see large drops in tech, massive drops in tech, right?"
"2870270","2873090"," But you're also going to see small caps sell-off. "
"2873430","2875790"," You're going to see value stocks sell-off."
"2876410","2877990"," You're going to see this happen."
"2878170","2887290"," You're going to see the entire market, the entire equity market generally follows the same trend. "
"2888570","2891570"," But there's a difference that I want you to understand, okay?"
"2892010","2897350"," And this is the value trap is, let's say you buy, let's say you buy, I don't fucking know."
"2897890","2902550"," And you can say, well, Home Depot has gone up, you know, 30 times over the past, whatever years."
"2903310","2907190"," But generally speaking, when you're trying to get into, hey, I'm just going to go buy value stocks. "
"2907770","2913890"," I'm just going to go buy small caps or mid caps or I'm going to buy real real profit driven"
"2913890","2914950"," ETFs."
"2916310","2924690"," They really don't, over time they don't actually pay steep profits like NASDAQ does."
"2924950","2927050"," They don't actually go as high as NASDAQ. "
"2927410","2929830"," And in turn, they have larger, steeper sell-offs."
"2930610","2935830"," So my point to you is this, is that sometimes you can see this in stark contrast as we can"
"2935830","2937790"," come further in time, right?"
"2938690","2944750"," And my point to you though is this is that, let's say today, let's say we have a big sell "
"2944750","2947010","-off, 400, right?"
"2948130","2949530"," Value is going to still sell down."
"2950230","2953650"," And your fucking Home Depot's are going to still sell down. "
"2954030","2957490"," And your Clorox bleach and your Coca-Cola, it doesn't matter, they're going to sell down."
"2957910","2959950"," The indexes that they're under are going to sell down."
"2960410","2967610"," And you might only lose two bucks on Coke, but you might lose, you know, 100 bucks, 200, 300, 400"
"2967610","2969090"," on Tesla. "
"2969550","2973910"," But you already understand that where we are, the regime, we already understand that we're going to"
"2973910","2975410"," have some bottoms in the market this year."
"2975950","2981210"," So your best bet, rather than saying, well, I'm going to load up on fucking Coca-Cola right now,"
"2981550","2985770"," because the market's going to go down anyways, you're going to lose two bucks, and it's only going"
"2985770","2987190"," to go up another two bucks, right?"
"2987730","2993750"," Whereas if you are holding cash, right, taking profit, and you're actually buying the fucking dips"
"2993750","2999950"," in tech, you're actually going to, when you finally actually get a bottom in tech, that final"
"2999950","3004050"," bottom in tech, right, where we're finally oversold me, finally liquidated the market for the last"
"3004050","3007370"," time, you're still going to be in a position where you're beating inflation."
"3008070","3012850"," If you stay within those value stocks, that shit goes sideways. "
"3013650","3017950"," That shit goes sideways, sideways, sideways, and never actually beats inflation."
"3018830","3024370"," In these times of stagflation in here, in the market, you'll wind up being just as bad."
"3025410","3028110"," Well, you won't be as bad as if you just stayed in tech. "
"3029090","3033710"," But this leads into the conversation we've had many fucking times where I say to you, if you are an"
"3033710","3040730"," investor in this market, that the easy street is over, it was over at the least it was over at"
"3040730","3041790"," the end of 2021."
"3042510","3046710"," And that means you have to manage your money, and you have to manage it for the next year to"
"3046710","3047170"," three years."
"3047910","3053870"," And I'll explain to you when you can, I'm going to show you here, when you can tell, when you"
"3053870","3055630"," don't have to actively manage your money. "
"3055810","3056790"," But right now, you do."
"3057210","3063350"," There's no place for you to hide in the equities market currently where the market's going to work"
"3063350","3068830"," that I can see that you can put your money into, let's say Coca-Cola, let's say right now you"
"3068830","3073350"," buy Coca-Fucking Cola, you'll just be stagnant for the next year."
"3074210","3075430"," Your money won't, won't beat inflation. "
"3076310","3078370"," You're not going to make any money, right?"
"3078890","3080350"," And if you've left it in tech, I'd be fucked."
"3080630","3083970"," But you already know that there are going to be bottoms that you can buy in tech."
"3084370","3086450"," So you have to actively buy tech, right?"
"3087190","3088850"," And then you have to actively take profit. "
"3089370","3090590"," And you just keep doing that."
"3091150","3097910"," And my point to you, but my point behind this is that, a point behind this is that because if"
"3097910","3103930"," you get stuck in value, right, you're going to be left with, with maybe, maybe breaking even after"
"3103930","3108810"," a year or two or three, that doesn't make any sense to me as a trader."
"3109210","3113370"," And for the investors, you can see we're rolling over here in the second half. "
"3113370","3121950"," You can see that when we resume that, let's say we resume the upward movement in the market, right?"
"3122090","3122630"," Let's say it's here."
"3122670","3123690"," Let's just pretend it's here."
"3124250","3125970"," Let's just pretend, right?"
"3126170","3131230"," And let's say we sell down, let's say we say everything gets awful, right?"
"3133010","3133890"," How do I do this?"
"3134210","3137290"," Let me see, let's say we get all doing a gloomy right?"
"3137390","3139770"," We'll keep selling down, but that's going as point. "
"3139870","3143290"," The moment that we resume this, this trade back up, right?"
"3144110","3152920"," There'll be a point in the market, there'll be a point in the market when you can resume this trade"
"3152920","3154540"," higher with safety, right?"
"3154980","3158160"," We have point we make an all-time new high that you can get back into that trade."
"3158320","3162800"," You take your profit here at each time we approach another top, right?"
"3163260","3164220"," And then you jump back in."
"3164500","3169520"," Now, every one of these bottoms down here that you actively manage buying tech, right?"
"3169600","3175060"," You're going to have bigger and better gains than having just sat for two years or three years in"
"3175060","3176360"," the value trade. "
"3176700","3177540"," I promise you that."
"3177780","3181440"," The only other thing I could think of that could be better might be, the only other thing I could"
"3181440","3186360"," think of that could be better might be the trade in oil, but we have a difference in oil right"
"3186360","3186560"," now."
"3186600","3191640"," The problem with oil is that real GDP is not projected to go up right now. "
"3191760","3197580"," So until that happens, as a matter of fact, when Q1 GDP came out, right?"
"3198160","3200980"," The projections, oil started to sell down as well."
"3201540","3202860"," And that's because of real GDP."
"3203240","3205060"," If you go back in history, you'll see that it follows it. "
"3205380","3211100"," You'll also go back in history and see that even we've gone into cycles where the S&P sells off"
"3211750","3213320"," and oil actually goes up."
"3214540","3219800"," GDP continues to go up and that's not we're in a different regime here than we have been in the"
"3219800","3220080"," past."
"3220720","3226400"," So my only take on this is to go straight back to what I talked to you about when I"
"3226400","3227820"," launched the ad captain's trades. "
"3228540","3231320"," And that was to close this up."
"3232100","3233760"," Let's just put your indicator on, right?"
"3233900","3235500"," You get your market breath indicator out there."
"3236140","3238260"," This has worked for me for years, right?"
"3241580","3242460"," Like bread. "
"3245380","3248740"," You put your market breath indicator in the S&P 500, right?"
"3249040","3250320"," You don't have to not buy tack."
"3250480","3251800"," You have to buy S&P 500."
"3254360","3257080"," Make sure I'm on one-year chart here and bring this back over here. "
"3259100","3261500"," And they'll get rid of all this other nonsense I put on here."
"3263040","3267820"," But it doesn't matter when you go back in time, you'll know when we're oversold that you can buy"
"3267820","3268820"," one of these bottoms."
"3269160","3275380"," And you can use this market breath indicator on the S&P 500 but apply it to NASDAQ. "
"3275900","3283400"," If you like Tesla, if you like Apple, if you like Facebook, you guys already know if it's in an"
"3283400","3286520"," accumulation phase or a distribution phase, right?"
"3286860","3287980"," Or a corrective phase."
"3288400","3291060"," How do you identify those phrases, right?"
"3291320","3296560"," You already know by watching companies like SNAP that they don't participate in market rallies,"
"3296560","3297100"," right?"
"3297360","3300380"," Unless we're super oversold, they might slightly, but they don't participate."
"3301280","3308500"," If you see Tesla not participating in a recovery off a market bottom, right, or oversold bottom,"
"3308940","3313520"," then you know it's an easy way to tell that, hey, Tesla's in a corrective phase. "
"3313900","3321300"," If you see Tesla participating in market bottoms, right, then you know that it's not in a"
"3321300","3322940"," corrective phase, right?"
"3323080","3327280"," So you can identify individual tickers if you're like, hey, cap, I want to buy Tesla, right?"
"3327460","3332720"," You can easily see, but in the regime that we're in right now, if you want to, if you want"
"3332720","3337200"," to save your money, save, save, save your cash, right?"
"3337400","3342820"," Even if we trade down here, there are going to be moments where you can look for, you can even"
"3342820","3347840"," compare these moments, go back and look at Tesla on December 1st, go back and look at Tesla on"
"3347840","3353560"," January 26th, go back and look at Tesla on February 23rd, go back and look at Tesla on March 15th,"
"3353560","3353660"," right?"
"3353980","3360720"," Go back here and look at Tesla on April 6th and see if it's participating, then you know it's not"
"3360720","3361800"," correcting right now."
"3362220","3364180"," Do you guys understand that?"
"3364720","3368800"," Because you'll see certain tickers when we have these huge moves, they don't participate."
"3369360","3375000"," You'll also see tickers when there's an accumulation going on, but they don't participate in sell "
"3375000","3375500","-offs either. "
"3376140","3381320"," Banks won't sell down the stocks that they're trying to accumulate and push higher, even if the"
"3381320","3382100"," market sells off."
"3382400","3386860"," So just for individual tickers, if you're like, hey, cap, I still want to buy Tesla, just be, just,"
"3386860","3391700"," if you just check when we have a market sell-off, we start to go back up as it participating."
"3391920","3393820"," If it is, you can accumulate Tesla. "
"3394260","3395300"," That's like a general rule."
"3395680","3400240"," If you, if at that moment you see that it's not participating or your favorite ticker out there,"
"3400640","3406460"," then you switch back to the indexes, you wait for the S&P to 500 to sell off, you don't"
"3406460","3409300"," buy your favorite ticker, and you just buy the S&P 500."
"3409900","3416360"," And then you sell the S&P 500, because you know right now that this year we're going to have"
"3416360","3417460"," some marked bottoms. "
"3417720","3423460"," You know that even if we come, if we break higher on the S&P 500, right, you know, you"
"3423460","3428020"," know we're going to have some tops up here, you know you can see it in this breadth indicator, and"
"3428020","3430380"," you also know that you don't need all of it."
"3430420","3435560"," You're only going to need to catch that bottom, wherever that bottom is, doesn't matter if that"
"3435560","3441860"," bottom keeps going down, and you also know that there are places to sell those tops, right?"
"3441940","3446020"," You take your money and run, take your money and run, and this area right here, you don't need"
"3446020","3451040"," this, because if we're going to turn bullish on the market and go ballistic, right, and we're going"
"3451040","3456700"," to go to like 6,000 or something, this is going to be like a speck of dust for you"
"3456700","3457000"," out there."
"3457020","3459700"," I think it's a speck of dust on your roadmap. "
"3460500","3462320"," This would have beaten inflation here, right?"
"3462500","3467040"," This would have beaten inflation here, and this next one doesn't matter where it bottoms out,"
"3467360","3467680"," right?"
"3467880","3473580"," Every time you do this, you buy these bottoms and you sell them until everybody knows that the"
"3473580","3475660"," market is going to go higher, which is what?"
"3475980","3476220"," What?"
"3476420","3477580"," New all-time highs, right?"
"3479080","3483840"," Until that happens, you can just keep doing this from now into end of year."
"3483960","3485260"," You can beat inflation this way."
"3485520","3491640"," If you don't participate like this, right, you will get stuck in those value stocks, right?"
"3491740","3495720"," And those value stocks, they're going to participate, but your coke's only going up two bucks,"
"3496220","3502300"," whereas the S&P is going up 30, 40, where Tesla's going to go up 200 or 300. "
"3502760","3503360"," Does that make sense?"
"3504080","3509780"," So whenever we have these rips in the market or these rips in Tesla, you want to be in Tesla,"
"3510060","3515520"," you want to be in fucking coke on a good day, you don't be in fucking coke going sideways with"
"3515520","3517040"," that kind of nonsense, you want to be in tech."
"3517820","3519740"," So keep that in mind, okay?"
"3520100","3524720"," You might say, hey, Cap, what about 2007 when it rolled over?"
"3525120","3528360"," When we clear this here, let me close that up here."
"3529000","3531420"," What about Cap when the, let's get rid of this over here. "
"3531560","3533320"," Let's bring this back up here."
"3533860","3535920"," Like, oh, Cap, what about in 2007, Cap?"
"3536420","3536940"," It was awful."
"3537240","3539660"," Look at that beautiful steep sell-off down here. "
"3540200","3541920"," Boom, beautiful buy, right?"
"3541920","3543440"," This is February 2018."
"3544080","3547200"," Hey, Cap, what, I don't know if we, I don't know if this is SBX."
"3547820","3551900"," Yeah, I think we can go back to 2007 here, because otherwise I think I have to go to the"
"3551900","3552980"," New New York Composite Index. "
"3553940","3558600"," I think we can go back to 2007 with that hellacious sell-off, right?"
"3560920","3563320"," Look at that nasty sell-off we had, right?"
"3564080","3565640"," It was like 2007, right?"
"3565820","3567480"," We're back in 2007, right?"
"3568340","3569980"," And you see it still worked here, right?"
"3570680","3572140"," You can see it down here, right?"
"3572260","3575100"," We traded higher here, went back down again over here."
"3575220","3575920"," We were able to buy it again."
"3576060","3581720"," We literally, you say people say, oh, 2007, everything was horrible, right?"
"3581820","3582400"," That's what they're telling you. "
"3582440","3582960"," Everything was horrible."
"3583640","3585680"," But in reality, there were relief rallies mixed in."
"3585800","3586880"," There's one right there, right?"
"3587560","3588640"," You see that relief rally?"
"3588820","3592420"," Let me get this nonsense over here, right?"
"3593660","3595060"," Yeah, another one up here, right?"
"3595760","3596240"," Sold it down. "
"3596400","3596900"," We sold it up."
"3597100","3600140"," We don't, we're not going to be buying twice in here."
"3600140","3601320"," We buy once, right?"
"3601460","3605300"," We buy some call spreads down in here, like 30 points, right?"
"3605960","3606780"," 30 points, right?"
"3606980","3608740"," This is $11.97 over here, right?"
"3609180","3612580"," This is $13.00, it's like 200 points or something, 170 points. "
"3612780","3613480"," You don't need that old trade."
"3613980","3615020"," You just need that one trade."
"3615520","3617140"," You wait until it sells off again. "
"3617680","3619040"," So this is a $2,000."
"3619380","3620540"," This is as shitty as it can get."
"3620980","3625500"," This is as fucking shitbox awful as everything can get. "
"3625700","3626440"," Leave and look at this here."
"3626960","3628440"," You even see down here, right?"
"3628440","3629880"," You were going to find this perfectly."
"3630460","3633380"," So you would have won this here and you would have won this here. "
"3633560","3638680"," So that point too is this, no matter what the fuck's coming down, the pike in the next year, no"
"3638680","3643700"," matter how bad it's going to get, you already know that you can have a mission planned until we"
"3643700","3645180"," resume higher, right?"
"3645320","3646280"," You can actually see that, right?"
"3646840","3651180"," This distribution down, we start to make all new highs."
"3651640","3653780"," You only need to win so many of these."
"3653780","3655040"," You can actually see them, right?"
"3655660","3660180"," You take that win, you take that win, you take that win, and then boom, we know, we know at"
"3660180","3663300"," some point that we don't have to manage our money for the next retire. "
"3663760","3666860"," So my point to you is, keep your chins up."
"3667080","3673340"," The point to you is that we know that we will be trading neutral or down in the year, right?"
"3673700","3674820"," At least it's just some point."
"3674920","3676120"," It doesn't fucking matter. "
"3676440","3680920"," It doesn't fucking matter if we sell this fucking, it doesn't matter if this fucking market fucking"
"3680920","3683040"," burns to the depths of fucking hell."
"3683440","3688280"," There are going to be oversold moments in it that you can buy and that you can even if you"
"3688280","3690120"," just place that one trade, right?"
"3690160","3695640"," You just place that one trade every one to three months, you put, you go balls deep into it, you"
"3695640","3699140"," go balls deep and you're not going to get them all, you know, a Tesla went up the other, I"
"3699140","3702420"," think last week Tesla went up to 200 points or some some kind of nonsense."
"3702580","3706180"," I would have missed that trade, but it doesn't matter if you missed that trade. "
"3706460","3711240"," What matters is that you're staying alive in the market that we have in front of us that you are"
"3711240","3716460"," beating inflation in the market that's in front of us and that once the regime changes to a bull"
"3716460","3721780"," market again, that you are still alive in this market, you're above inflation, you're beating"
"3721780","3726740"," everybody else out there, you've beaten bullshit value stocks and you're properly, properly"
"3726740","3732800"," positioned with a ton of fucking cash, so that you're not stuck fucking off with value stocks for"
"3732800","3738760"," fucking past two years or six months or three years or the fuck it is nine months, it doesn't"
"3738760","3739600"," fucking matter, right?"
"3740000","3745360"," You're jerking off with Coca Cola or Costco, no fencing in those companies, those fucking boomer"
"3745360","3747240"," stocks, they're trying to unload on you."
"3747720","3751840"," It's because they need to sell their fucking bags to somebody and they're going to sell them to you"
"3751840","3754960"," and you're going to get trapped in it for this next year or two."
"3755480","3758440"," So keep buying fucking tech is my point. "
"3758660","3764360"," It doesn't matter if this fucking market sells off to the depths of hell, there will be moments for"
"3764360","3768980"," you to buy all the way down to the depths of hell and ride it all the way back up"
"3768980","3770080"," out of the depths of hell."
"3770220","3775180"," There isn't a time in history that I've gone back to where you can't time this to a certain extent,"
"3775820","3776960"," at least to a certain point."
"3777400","3780140"," Now we're there right now, we're not there right now, right?"
"3780340","3781320"," We already know that we're not there. "
"3781420","3782720"," We need to be down here."
"3783000","3787460"," So your next buy we're looking for the next capitulation moment in the market."
"3788000","3789460"," How long do you have to trade this regime?"
"3790040","3796080"," I don't know, three months, six months, at least until we're above fucking 480 right now, right?"
"3796360","3797640"," At least until that point. "
"3798080","3803120"," So for right now, if you're looking for how do I how do I invest in this market cap?"
"3803420","3806160"," No, you don't just fucking keep adding your paycheck every week."
"3806200","3812580"," You hold cash every month, three months, you're going to go fucking balls deep on a bottom and"
"3812580","3816220"," you're going to buy a fucking bottom and you're going to run it up and you're going to make 100%,"
"3816220","3818700"," 200%, 300% in one trade."
"3818700","3821840"," And then you're going to you're going to double triple quadruple your money. "
"3822160","3826100"," And then you can go and piss off with me and day trade your piss away or some of your"
"3826100","3831280"," gains with me day trade and zero dates here on fucking livestream every day."
"3831760","3837200"," But for the regime that we're in right now, my point to you is don't get stuck in the value"
"3837200","3837540"," trap."
"3837900","3842240"," Don't get fucking stuck in the oil, but don't get do right now do not get stuck in the oil"
"3842240","3842420"," trap. "
"3842600","3844920"," Well, I can keep going up, but I promise you right now, right?"
"3845300","3846820"," Go back and look at fucking real GDP."
"3847380","3851660"," It fucking tracks it to a fucking tee and real GDP is expected to go down."
"3851980","3855060"," So I'm like previous examples in the past. "
"3855420","3857600"," Our GDP kept going up and right now it's not."
"3858000","3859640"," And you can see that in oil right now."
"3859760","3860560"," Now, can oil go up?"
"3860720","3860800"," Sure. "
"3861300","3867380"," Well, go up some extra exogenous impacts can send it up."
"3867660","3871980"," We get into a bigger fucking extended war, let's say with Russia where fucking China acts up with"
"3871980","3872200"," Taiwan."
"3872480","3872660"," Sure. "
"3873040","3873920"," No fucking problem."
"3874120","3874820"," They can go up with that."
"3874820","3877180"," They can bounce up outside of its bounds. "
"3877620","3883380"," But for me, if I'm looking for a guaranteed fucking thing, right, it ain't fucking oil."
"3883600","3884700"," I can't guarantee it's oil."
"3885120","3890420"," I can guarantee that if the market fucking capitulates once every one to three months, they can buy"
"3890420","3891660"," the fuck out of that bottom. "
"3892040","3897500"," And I've been able to buy the fuck out of that bottom going back to fucking the 1930s, right, and"
"3897500","3899420"," make my money and stay ahead of the game."
"3899620","3900220"," That's what they do."
"3900360","3901560"," That's what the banks do. "
"3901560","3904220"," The banks have to buy these markets at some point."
"3904900","3907320"," So I want you to be aware of that as we trade forward in the market."
"3908500","3911940"," I gave you my I gave you what I gave you what I thought was going to happen today. "
"3912680","3914000"," We'll look at this one more time."
"3915460","3916540"," We'll get rid of this right here."
"3920140","3921480"," I'm going to dump this right here. "
"3922180","3927360"," Got a little bounce off our two above here, right, which I'll trade over up to 445 33."
"3929000","3932100"," If you guys are looking to see what I think's going to happen today, look at that."
"3932220","3937120"," Look at that same one that I was showing you guys on Twitter for the past five days, right?"
"3937960","3938940"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"3939220","3940040"," Look at that, huh?"
"3940540","3942420"," But I showed you guys that chart last week, right?"
"3942560","3943960"," Look at that sexy old chart over there."
"3944340","3944860"," And look at that."
"3945100","3946840"," Bam, bang, bang, bang. "
"3947780","3951960"," So what do I think is going to happen here?"
"3953160","3957580"," I think, I think the shorts are going to ship their pants."
"3957640","3959030"," I think we're going to trade higher."
"3959950","3965010"," I think going to retest 445 33 at least in in cash market. "
"3966710","3969370"," I think if I think if you're lucky, we'll catch a bounce."
"3969370","3971270"," This is our our two's at 442."
"3971810","3975710"," And we'll check this out on book map and see if we actually get some nice support down here. "
"3975930","3977170"," We'll look at book map here."
"3977290","3979350"," It's the 914, right?"
"3979810","3983670"," We'll bring up book map and we'll see if there's an actual support here now, 442."
"3986250","3991830"," We are going to wind up. "
"3993310","3995890"," Let me see when we get back to that five-man chart, it's not short."
"3996310","3999170"," Do you see that Johnson and it's fine as soon as we're fine?"
"3999170","4002090"," I think that we could actually test 450."
"4002930","4007610"," I want to say if not today, tomorrow, 450 could be on board. "
"4008370","4015930"," So maybe something like, let me see here, something like this and then something like that."
"4017350","4020010"," And you might get, this might actually trade down here."
"4020830","4023890"," So your first short should be like somewhere up in here, maybe. "
"4024650","4025270"," Don't hold me to this."
"4026390","4031410"," But I would definitely, definitely, definitely don't hold that shit down here because I think it's"
"4031410","4032430"," going to squeeze back up higher."
"4033170","4035390"," And I think your second short is probably up here, 450. "
"4035970","4039110"," It could be wrong on this, but look back in December."
"4040410","4044990"," And this is, it's just this kind of, you know, a Johnson and Scumac resign."
"4045690","4047750"," So it's something, I think it's going to be something like this. "
"4048250","4051930"," I don't know if we sell down and then we do this and this, we'll check that out on the"
"4051930","4054490"," open, but I think shorts are going to get fucked at the bell."
"4054950","4056750"," I think puts are going to get closed at the bell as well."
"4057970","4061490"," And bears going to look for a better better positioning, right?"
"4061610","4062750"," We talked about this on Twitter yesterday. "
"4063210","4066090"," I think the bears want to be positioned here and here."
"4066350","4068670"," I wouldn't want to be, I wouldn't want to be a bear running the bell going."
"4069050","4076250"," Yeah, fuck you were selling this down because CPI wasn't wasn't, you know, wasn't fucking 14%. "
"4076250","4080710"," So nothing you can fucking do if you're a bear, your shit out of luck."
"4080770","4083930"," So your first short is here and your second short is here."
"4084350","4088650"," And you maybe your third short is above that range, above that channel. "
"4089430","4092870"," Now if a bull's going to tell you that we're going to trade higher and blast off to all time"
"4092870","4094770"," eyes, I fucking doubt it."
"4095310","4098410"," Every month we trade down like this, okay, coming into no pecs."
"4098609","4103229"," And we also have the GPM collar down here. "
"4105649","4110430"," Hopefully, my boy, Damon can get his collar closed."
"4111029","4113470"," If he closes this, you guys know about the GPM collar, right?"
"4113970","4118550"," GPM collar, this motherfucker, this asshole, what he did up here is this."
"4119330","4120050"," Show you what he did. "
"4121109","4125609"," So up here, Jamie, boy, Jamie, Diamond, right?"
"4125990","4127310"," He sold calls up here."
"4128689","4130450"," Okay, so he did he sold calls."
"4131410","4132170"," That's what he did. "
"4135060","4138100"," And he took the money, right?"
"4139640","4144420"," And from selling those calls, well, he knows, he's going to impact the market."
"4145020","4145920"," And he bought put spreads."
"4148100","4148859"," That's what he did. "
"4151640","4154920"," This is what I'm teaching you guys how to do at Captain's trades."
"4156420","4157540"," He bought put spreads."
"4160390","4162569"," And those put spreads are down here. "
"4163250","4164930"," They're in the money, right down here."
"4165550","4169930"," So if he can get down here at some point, right, with his trade, right, what he will do is"
"4169930","4171990"," he'll close those put spreads."
"4172950","4174170"," And guess what they end up doing?"
"4174770","4175770"," They fucking buy calls. "
"4176069","4176649"," I shoot you not."
"4177470","4179770"," They literally buy call spreads, right?"
"4180350","4182729"," And the market moves where they want it to."
"4183270","4185649"," So we'll trade down here and trade back up higher. "
"4187130","4189330"," So that's my that's my take on where we're at."
"4189930","4191470"," That's what I think is going to happen."
"4191630","4192770"," I don't know that it happens right now. "
"4192810","4193510"," We're gonna have bloodbath."
"4194090","4195090"," I think we trade up here."
"4195470","4196850"," I think we might even trade up here. "
"4196850","4199150"," And then we come back down into OPEX."
"4199270","4201650"," I think we have capitulation at some point."
"4201770","4202970"," It could be now, it could be next week. "
"4203590","4205830"," It could be the week after OPEX could be Monday."
"4207090","4208870"," But I think we still we still trade down."
"4209110","4210770"," Is this bottom if you want to know?"
"4211270","4211990"," I don't know. "
"4212090","4212390"," I don't know."
"4212910","4214090"," It's good enough for me."
"4214310","4218430"," But it's not lining up to is the capitulation. "
"4218930","4224110"," It's not hitting what I wanted to hit to go balls deep into a trade with no worries."
"4224790","4230750"," So I am not sold on this being where I want to go along this market."
"4233230","4234010"," So here we go. "
"4234050","4235910"," We've got the market about to open here."
"4235990","4240210"," You can see we've got some resistance without even being open here at 446."
"4241190","4242490"," So keep that in mind. "
"4244370","4245670"," Keep in mind over here."
"4245730","4246450"," We'll see if that changes."
"4247530","4250250"," We'll be looking for 446 for some sellers. "
"4251270","4252490"," It's right up in this area here."
"4252670","4253630"," Right up in this zone right here."
"4254290","4255770"," Some sellers hiding up here. "
"4256110","4257130"," They're pissed off up here."
"4257210","4257790"," It's 446."
"4258130","4259990"," They're pissed off right up in here. "
"4268550","4270170"," Yeah, selling calls, right?"
"4270550","4273330"," So they own the S&P 500."
"4273630","4274630"," They own SPX."
"4275370","4277050"," They own the underlying security. "
"4277990","4281150"," And what they do is they sell you calls on it."
"4281350","4283290"," So they sell you, right?"
"4283510","4286310"," They sell bull's calls, right?"
"4286470","4289890"," Which is a bearish position selling calls on the underlying security."
"4292190","4292790"," Good question. "
"4303250","4305310"," Chase like we short right now."
"4307470","4310870"," I'm looking at what you guys are doing now."
"4310990","4313230"," So we've got 10 minutes left. "
"4313390","4315470"," I'm going to go through the chat where you guys are saying now."
"4315850","4316390"," I wasn't reading."
"4316830","4321550"," I'm sorry for the messy discussion this morning about macro. "
"4322090","4323650"," I wanted it to be clear."
"4324750","4326030"," But it wasn't quite cleaner."
"4326190","4326950"," Full nature of the incident. "
"4329030","4332450"," Maybe we'll see some call premium kick in this morning as well."
"4333970","4337830"," We'll see if we get some premium kick in and some calls at the bell this morning."
"4338490","4341410"," Let me know in the chat what you think is going to happen off the bell. "
"4342450","4343370"," Because I think we're going higher."
"4347740","4349000"," So the bulls didn't buy the calls."
"4350300","4352880"," The bulls did buy calls. "
"4352880","4360540"," I've got the the good question, Josh, because the hero indicators showed that calls are bought at"
"4360540","4361020"," the bell."
"4361480","4362760"," Only at the bell."
"4363460","4367760"," If you I'll read I'll bring back the spot gamma thing from this morning. "
"4368400","4369900"," They didn't buy calls all day long."
"4369900","4371120"," They bought them at the bell though."
"4374690","4378790"," Look after them bothered to read all DJ and talking about selling goat to beat inflation. "
"4382630","4383910"," How y'all doing?"
"4384030","4384250"," Hey, Dan."
"4384390","4384770"," How are you doing?"
"4385990","4387410"," Francis say we sell off."
"4387470","4388950"," Still letting the other handle the captain. "
"4389710","4390390"," Yes, sir."
"4390730","4392830"," So the the other handle you'll get my trades."
"4393250","4396870"," I'm only going to post trades when I take them on that handle. "
"4397110","4401810"," You won't get any other notifications on that handle except for when I go to make a trade and I'll"
"4401810","4402690"," live stream that trade."
"4404090","4405170"," 921 right now."
"4405550","4406310"," Nine minutes left. "
"4412470","4415530"," Yeah, I was just trying to like trying to figure out."
"4415690","4417370"," I'm trying to figure out a limit."
"4417910","4419390"," I got the top chat on again. "
"4419590","4420150"," Not live chat."
"4420430","4420490"," Boom."
"4420650","4421270"," Back to live chat. "
"4423230","4424370"," Yeah, good to see you too, Dan."
"4424550","4425290"," Thanks for showing up this morning."
"4425290","4425970"," I appreciate it. "
"4431780","4432440"," Just double."
"4432440","4432620"," Yeah."
"4432900","4433100"," Sportk. "
"4433160","4433840"," Good to see you too."
"4434020","4437640"," Just double the CPI to get real inflation has been true for the better half of the year."
"4437780","4437780"," Yeah. "
"4438180","4438520"," Fuck yeah."
"4438820","4439800"," I'm in it right now."
"4439960","4443300"," I'm seeing real inflation that's out of fucking control right now. "
"4446450","4448470"," They didn't tell us it was 14 for a cent."
"4454000","4456120"," Yeah, I think you'll get a retest at least of 445."
"4457560","4458920"," I think you'll at least see that retest. "
"4462100","4463040"," Hey, your wife's boyfriend."
"4463140","4464080"," Good to see you this morning, brother."
"4474350","4475950"," Margaret Brown Valley is in. "
"4476450","4477330"," Yep, there is."
"4477490","4478270"," Call the market growth indicator."
"4481580","4482020"," Yeah. "
"4482140","4482680"," It's fucked up."
"4482840","4485100"," My microphone is my microphone."
"4485100","4494460"," The expander and the so I loaded my microphone today and it didn't load up my expander and my"
"4494460","4494820"," compressor. "
"4495620","4497100"," So I can cut."
"4497360","4499880"," If I cut this off, I can reload it back up and it will."
"4501540","4502840"," It'll be a better broadcast. "
"4503300","4506760"," So I promise that tomorrow's will be better."
"4508540","4509420"," So yeah, I see."
"4509720","4511860"," I see another least on the retest here. "
"4514280","4515480"," 444 86."
"4516160","4516220"," I"
"4516220","4526620"," don't"
"4526620","4528780"," care how far we might for 50 might be tomorrow."
"4529560","4533860"," But I would think I would think that you know, we're s1 and s2 are you already you got your"
"4533860","4534780"," support levels, right?"
"4535400","4537480"," You get us one here at 439 87. "
"4537700","4538340"," Remember this too."
"4538400","4538660"," Okay."
"4539240","4542500"," When you guys to see this, you see s1 and r1 here, right?"
"4543360","4547680"," This area here is for a squeeze, right?"
"4548260","4550460"," Because don't see how tight this is s1 and r1. "
"4551100","4555400"," And the reason being is because if it was really shitty, we would have sold down heavy and hard."
"4556140","4564420"," And we should expect the same to take place with with it."
"4565820","4568180"," For all extensive purposes, a nothing burger. "
"4568380","4575310"," The only thing I think we'd have to watch out for today would be would be Biden speech."
"4575990","4579290"," I think that they'll be at 230 or something."
"4582560","4584840"," So we have six minutes until market open. "
"4589250","4591970"," Now these change too, just to give you guys a heads up."
"4592070","4597950"," So these do change as as market opens, you'll see the levels change."
"4598950","4604960"," I was still low, low liquidity environment, five minutes left to the bell. "
"4612750","4622550"," It's a piece of glass higher because better than expected CPI."
"4627400","4630100"," No shit, your RTX 380 kept overheating with the side on."
"4631320","4632360"," Could it be back GP?"
"4632660","4633140"," Good to see brother. "
"4635300","4641280"," Sorry, buying calls up to 446 and open them, or are you going to watch a good question, it's a"
"4641280","4641660"," good question."
"4641940","4643380"," So I'm in calls."
"4644580","4647320"," I bought some some shit tickets yesterday at the bell. "
"4649100","4650780"," I bought some shit tickets down here."
"4652240","4657800"," My point my my thing to you today would be that if we if we take profit at any point"
"4657800","4660920"," today, I would be definitely buying a dip here."
"4665060","4667920"," If we if we trade here, I'll buy this dip right away. "
"4668100","4669380"," I'll add more right here."
"4669400","4671000"," I'll buy this dip right off the bell."
"4671120","4671700"," I'd buy this dip. "
"4672340","4677540"," If we trade higher though and reject, I'd be looking to buy the dip here."
"4678020","4679100"," So we clear that off."
"4679440","4684140"," So off the bell, if we trade down, I'm going to look to buy that by that dip. "
"4686040","4691880"," If off the bell we trade higher, I'm going to look to sell and look to buy a dip lower"
"4691880","4692980"," right here."
"4693100","4693900"," I'm going to look by that dip."
"4694400","4695300"," Good question. "
"4696860","4700060"," Another thing we can do real quick is we'll get rid of this."
"4700540","4703980"," Now, the reason being is because I think the I think is a bear."
"4704220","4705560"," I think let's be honest. "
"4706260","4713940"," If you're a bear for that report this morning, your best positioning is without a doubt here and"
"4713940","4715280"," here for the next short."
"4716220","4720000"," Without a doubt, it's not, it's not, I'm not arguable at this point."
"4721280","4729540"," And a large timeframe, a large timeframe, it's not unreasonable for us to trade up here before he"
"4729540","4734640"," meets some resistance, not off its table to trade to 450 with that report. "
"4735720","4739620"," But let's look at some other stuff, okay, before we open here, we've got three minutes left."
"4740740","4748300"," Get your little charts out that you got out there and just put, snap yourself a small line here and"
"4748300","4749720"," you can just see S1 right there."
"4752430","4757250"," So back to one day and you can see that, well, I don't know why that line's not fucking showing"
"4757250","4757610"," up. "
"4758890","4759170"," Come on here."
"4759450","4761630"," Come on here, Bruce."
"4761870","4764230"," I don't know why that's all fucked up. "
"4765690","4767230"," We'll snap a little line here."
"4770340","4778630"," It's a nice little point down there and we'll see if, we'll see if we trade down and I'd be"
"4778630","4779750"," looking to buy this S1."
"4779850","4781850"," If we sold right down, I'd be looking to buy this without a doubt. "
"4783010","4784190"," Hands down, I'd be looking to buy that."
"4784630","4790010"," If we, if we, if we gap up or start trading straight higher, I'll look to take some profit and"
"4793890","4803770"," I will bring up, here we go, hold on here for a"
"4803770","4803970"," second."
"4806090","4812210"," We get the bell coming up here in two minutes, a minute 15, excuse me. "
"4813670","4814970"," In these levels, we'll change."
"4815210","4816110"," We'll take a quick look at the levels."
"4816390","4820650"," We'll see if the buyers step in or not and where we trade from here. "
"4824490","4827610"," Yeah, I'll show QQQs as soon as we open, I will."
"4833670","4834470"," You're shorting."
"4834570","4834810"," Hey, Matt. "
"4835010","4835310"," Good morning."
"4837980","4839180"," No Fed speaker tours today."
"4839300","4840220"," They must be tired and rest. "
"4840400","4843700"," No, I thought we had speakers today."
"4844120","4844480"," Let me look."
"4848120","4851060"," Kind of sucks because I can't hear the news. "
"4851180","4852780"," I might end up speaking over today."
"4853400","4855720"," I have to figure out why I can't hear us to trade the news."
"4859840","4860280"," Let's see. "
"4860440","4869660"," I'm going to add an audio source, a mixer, display capture. "
