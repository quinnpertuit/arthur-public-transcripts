"hieKIv8-UO4","2987760","2992400"," But once you start having hourly coming in underneath this this will set the tone and trend"
"hieKIv8-UO4","2993040","2996400"," For continued down for the weeks at least two to three weeks"
"hieKIv8-UO4","2997040","3000480"," So you'll be looking for that into the clothes today and then tomorrow"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3002000","3009400"," Any kind of move higher should be rejected off of the hourly right now it currently sits at 4.0 to 10"

"hieKIv8-UO4","3578120","3584920"," 40 here all this nonsense all the time in social media and they get it they're wrong by 50 fucking points"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3585480","3588440"," Uh where it actually is so just be aware of this down here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3588760","3591320"," You've got the weekly trigger down here the monthly trigger down here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3591800","3594120"," This is kind of like the place that you buy down in here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3594360","3600200"," This is the last place that we bought down here was down here in this monthly weekly trigger two three days later"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3600440","3603800"," It just rips fucking face off of it every time"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3604360","3606840"," It's a kick-ass place to buy the market down here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3607640","3612520"," Now with that being said there are some major problems here. Uh, this is a five-minute chart"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3612520","3617320"," We're going to look at the one hour. Okay. This is what I really want you to see here on this one hour chart"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3617800","3621240"," Uh, this is a trend reversal. You see this failure to make new high"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3621800","3625480"," Remember when algo mcago face said we would fail to make this new high"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3626120","3630920"," And they would come back up and trade this right here. I don't know if that continues with algo mcago face"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3631320","3635080"," But he called the algo called the failure to make this high back here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3635640","3641080"," Uh, but he didn't have death for us. He had sideways and actually up into march in april"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3641880","3643880"," Okay, so keep this number down here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3644280","3649240"," Uh on your radar down at 395 70 or so to try to take this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3649800","3654360"," Uh and consolidate this market for the rest of the week and then go higher now the bears"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3655000","3661560"," Are in control right now this market now we can say that let's buy a dip down below here and have some stops underneath it"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3662200","3667320"," Right we cut our losses down here if we start to head lower, but the truth is right now"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3667880","3672360"," Uh, we're in a bull on a bear stance. I want you to understand that. I want to explain it to you here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3672840","3676120"," Uh, i'm going to explain it in a better way and then i'll chart all this out for you"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3676680","3678680"," Now just right now, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3678920","3680920"," Forget about all this for the moment"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3681080","3683480"," This isn't this isn't as important right now"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3684520","3690520"," But what is important for you to understand is when we trade underneath this daily trigger and the hourly comes down"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3691000","3696840"," That we're we're bearish until we get above it the hourly the daily trend is lower"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3698200","3700200"," Okay, now bears have to of course"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3701160","3706040"," Defend that right you can't just blast under here and think that that you're defending it"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3706040","3709800"," You're not you have to come back up here and defend your position as a bear"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3710200","3712440"," It doesn't work that way where you just blast down"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3713000","3717000"," Five that well, I guess it does we can blast down 5,000 points. I guess I guess"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3717640","3721960"," Uh the 1% chance of that happening number the truth is"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3723400","3725400"," I'm bringing this over for you"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3725400","3727960"," Turn this music off. Some of these slungs are garbage"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3728920","3730920"," So I want you to see this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3731480","3733960"," For trend purposes, okay, we're gonna go to a"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3735800","3737800"," Go to a 30 minute here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3738840","3740840"," Go to a one hour or four hour, I guess"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3742680","3745160"," And what you need to know about trend and its importance"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3745800","3748280"," Uh to the market when we trade you see this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3748920","3755160"," See that green arrow down there and that maybe I can bring it closer to you so you can see it the importance of this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3758360","3762520"," So yellow is the trend when we get underneath with that hourly underneath that yellow"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3762520","3765080"," It's very bad usually same thing on the upside"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3767400","3771240"," Price trades above the yellow line with the green line and it's blast off time"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3772200","3774200"," These last for periods of time here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3774760","3778440"," Consist july 11th rate all the way into july 22nd"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3778920","3783720"," The fair bit of time there that you spend uh trading that right and right now"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3784520","3788680"," The bulls are saying or bulls were saying oh, no, no, no, no"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3789320","3791320"," Look at that. We squeezed up here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3791320","3797560"," Bull bull market confirmed for 430 460 that kind of stuff and what the bulls needed to do was"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3798120","3800120"," To confirm it right they come back down"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3800840","3805160"," They confirmed this and they had higher well bulls couldn't fucking do that could they"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3805560","3809960"," Uh, so the bull the ball is now back in the bear's court believe it or not"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3810360","3813880"," And they have to defend this they have to defend this hourly trend"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3814360","3820600"," Have the hourly come back down with them and price to go lower and blast through this this weekly and this monthly here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3820840","3824840"," We know that the weekly and monthly was destroyed in end of february"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3825240","3829480"," And this is what they want into into end of month right at the end of march down here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3829480","3831320"," Some nice fat lower lows"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3831320","3834600"," At 3600 and you have to ask yourself the question in here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3835000","3839240"," If the move is higher is it only for 100 points or is it for 300 points?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3839640","3844680"," Are we going to get an easier 300 points down here and then catch nice bounce for a run into summer?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3845000","3849240"," Or is this even the end where we get that last capitulation move in the market?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3849240","3852440"," So just right now looking at this right let's look at this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3853080","3857560"," Like a real deal. Let's look at this and you'll see see this green arrow coming out"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3857560","3862200"," This green line coming down this yellow line for underneath it the bears for them to"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3862680","3865640"," Confirm they want to see this green line come underneath"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3865960","3870920"," They want to see price reject off of this and start to smash and bash through"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3871480","3877320"," And then you get your huge move underneath these levels here the yellow line will come down the green line will come down"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3877720","3882600"," And they finally get their bloodbath. They've tried right. They tried right here. They tried right here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3883720","3887640"," And I want you to see that it didn't work. Okay. It did not work for them to get"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3888040","3892840"," Uh that breakthrough and that's what they keep trying for to change that trend to the downside"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3892920","3899960"," They need help on a negative momentum to send us lower now for this week for the rest of this week"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3902440","3907880"," The rest of this week, I'm going to chart it out for you what exactly what you need to know for this week"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3908920","3912360"," Let's show you where supply and demand is in this market"

"hieKIv8-UO4","3993720","3998920"," You can buy these dips down here and start selling these rip these or seller rips from up here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","3999640","4005320"," This momentum is turning down right now. So these love these red and yellow boxes are going to come down"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4005320","4009880"," Believe it or not. Now what that is where the sellers are in this market sitting right up here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4010840","4016680"," If the bulls can retake at any point we will then close this gap and make our move higher"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4017480","4024760"," And be bullish again until that happens for the rest of the week from today to Tuesday into Wednesday Thursday and Friday"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4025080","4032680"," A bear's job is just to sell from above here right in here. They're going to be selling this selling this selling this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4033080","4036600"," That's all they want to do get down underneath get price underneath"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4037160","4042040"," Just like this let this momentum catch back up and then take this even this market even lower"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4042040","4045800"," Do I think we do this? I don't know the living that I know is"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4047240","4053960"," You buy these dips and you sell these rips until this until this balances itself out and figures out a direction"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4054360","4057880"," Higher or lower that's all you're going to be doing for the next five days"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4058280","4062040"," So i'm going to uh delete all that you can just take a snap of this"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4062680","4064680"," Right now so you can see where it's at"

"hieKIv8-UO4","4252520","4255640"," You can't get a leg down unless you you have to blast through this stuff"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4256360","4259240"," And hope so like if this was not a larger time frame right here"
"hieKIv8-UO4","4259960","4264520"," Uh what you need pretend this was like a I don't know like a weekly or monthly or something like that"

"hieKIv8-UO4","7838880","7842880"," So you have to let them be and let them grow up a little bit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7842880","7846880"," So springtime comes rolling around and you wind up."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7846880","7849880"," You turn from a calf into a young bull."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7849880","7851880"," They're all beef, man."

"hieKIv8-UO4","7889880","7893880"," You have to corral them away from their moms and then you've got to fucking wrestle them"
"hieKIv8-UO4","7893880","7896880"," down and snip their balls, man."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7896880","7898880"," And you fry those bad boys up."

"hieKIv8-UO4","7904880","7909880"," Snip the two little veins."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7909880","7911880"," You just slip them right out with your hand."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7911880","7915880"," Slips right out of their ball sack."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7916880","7921880"," It's not my family ranch, not my ranch."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7921880","7925880"," That life is not easy."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7925880","7927880"," I wouldn't want to do it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7927880","7929880"," I want nothing to do with it."

"hieKIv8-UO4","7949880","7951880"," It's not an easy life."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7951880","7954880"," Matter of fact, one is out in."
"hieKIv8-UO4","7954880","7960880"," One of them is work or was where I think he still is, but he was working in."

"hieKIv8-UO4","8028880","8030880"," You have to do it though."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8030880","8034880"," Can't have a bunch of bulls walking around."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8034880","8036880"," You know what happens when you get like a bunch of bulls walking around?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8036880","8037880"," It's a disaster."

"hieKIv8-UO4","8044880","8047880"," It's very rare to see cattle like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8047880","8049880"," They don't get finished in California or nothing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8049880","8054880"," These are up in the mountains of Montana and they have their real true fruit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8054880","8056880"," The beef is unreal."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8056880","8059880"," Only goes to the best restaurants and shit in the country."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8059880","8060880"," This stuff you can't."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8060880","8064880"," You can't get this at the grocery store."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8064880","8066880"," You'll see like cows running and shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8066880","8070880"," I don't know if you've ever seen like a real true free range cow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8070880","8073880"," They're different."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8073880","8075880"," Even the female cows, they run around."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8075880","8081880"," They like stampede from place to place and run around circles and stuff."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8081880","8089880"," You can tell the difference between a cow that's in pasture and a cow that is truly free range."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8089880","8096880"," Whole different thing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8096880","8097880"," Yeah, man."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8097880","8099880"," It's really cool out there."

"hieKIv8-UO4","8100880","8101880"," They have."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8101880","8102880"," They have."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8102880","8103880"," So it's middle of nowhere, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8103880","8105880"," You can't get there by a highway."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8105880","8107880"," So it's like no highway to get there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8107880","8110880"," So there's no way to get there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8111880","8117880"," And so if you're like driving through, you're not going to drive through this place."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8117880","8123880"," You'd have to like take a 300 mile detour to get there off of whatever route that you're on."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8123880","8125880"," Now to go, there's nobody's ever there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8125880","8128880"," They have real cowboys out there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8128880","8130880"," They have a gay cowboy night at the local bar."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8130880","8133880"," There's like one bar for 300 miles."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8133880","8135880"," And they have a gay cowboy night."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8136880","8139880"," Because these cowboys come out there from all over the world."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8139880","8142880"," They come out from Mexico and then you got some from Texas."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8142880","8146880"," And you get a bunch from New Mexico, Utah, stuff like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8146880","8148880"," These are there are true."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8148880","8152880"," There are real places, not many, but there are some real places left in the U.S."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8152880","8155880"," that have real cowboys."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8155880","8158880"," Like honest, honest, the truth, real cowboys like to have a Mexico."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8158880","8161880"," South America has more like real cowboys and shit left."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8161880","8164880"," There aren't many left like South America has them."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8164880","8168880"," There are a few places left in the U.S."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8168880","8172880"," And this is a place in the southeastern corner of Montana."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8172880","8176880"," It's called the loneliest place in the lower 58."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8176880","8180880"," And so you see these cowboys out there and they ride horses."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8180880","8186880"," Because they get these down trees and you can't ride four wheelers through them."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8186880","8193880"," They take the cattle 1500 head and they'll graze them across high mountain plains."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8193880","8196880"," They'll still use wagons, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8196880","8202880"," And they will stay out for days on end with shotguns looking for grizzly bears"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8202880","8204880"," because grizzly bears are come down through the hills."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8204880","8208880"," And you got to blast off some shotguns to scare their grizzly bears away."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8208880","8209880"," It's real shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8209880","8213880"," Early market on closing balance, 357 million to the south side."

"hieKIv8-UO4","8232880","8235880"," What do they call pavement princesses and stuff?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8235880","8238880"," Like there's still parts of like out there."

"hieKIv8-UO4","8249880","8254880"," We know with who they're living with, so you don't see any of that shit out there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8254880","8256880"," I have never seen it out there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8256880","8262880"," You see that shit in like fake country and fake, you know, that's where you see that shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8262880","8268880"," You don't see that shit and like people that are making their living off the land and stuff like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8269880","8277880"," All right, I never saw it, I guess."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8277880","8280880"," I guess it was probably was there generations ago."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8280880","8288880"," We have a pretty dark history of the United States of being kind of fucked up to people, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8288880","8289880"," Oh, I guess we try."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8289880","8295880"," That's the one that's my one saving hope for the United States is that we try to become better."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8296880","8301880"," Right, we're at least trying to always for all of our faults of the bad shit that we've done."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8303880","8308880"," They try to have hope that the US will be a better country."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8313880","8315880"," Learn from our mistakes and all that kind of shit."

"hieKIv8-UO4","8366880","8368880"," They're not going to want to pay him."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8368880","8369880"," I know that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8373880","8378880"," You can't win them all when you live stream."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8378880","8387880"," You can't claim winners every day."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8387880","8388880"," Can you?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8388880","8392880"," There's no possible way to win when you tell the truth."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8392880","8396880"," Like when you're like come back on fucking you when you make a video and be like, that was awesome."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8396880","8398880"," You know, you just can't win."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8399880","8404880"," You can't win every day when you're when you're when you're trading live."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8404880","8406880"," This doesn't happen."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8408880","8413880"," Now trade eight cents on 400 C dollar eight on 400 C for tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8418880","8420880"," Now nine cents on 400 C."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8429880","8430880"," Come on now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8430880","8432880"," Squeeze up to come to daddy."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8433880","8435880"," Just squeeze up there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8435880","8436880"," I already know the irony."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8436880","8438880"," So this this yellow bar right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8438880","8441880"," This is where all those puts are."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8442880","8445880"," This is where we've got 400,000 puts."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8445880","8450880"," And right now they're worth a dollar twenty three right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8451880","8452880"," I don't think they want to."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8452880","8457880"," I don't think dealers want to pay those out into the bell some kind of riding on this trade higher right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8459880","8463880"," They're not going to want to pay out even if they close the money, they're not going to want to pay them out."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8463880","8467880"," So I might take off the if we get up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8467880","8473880"," I might take off at least the calls from today and lick my wounds on that trade there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8473880","8475880"," It's their nine cents right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8475880","8477880"," I'm going to try to hand sell them."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8480880","8484880"," I'm going to get out of this because I'm looking at two different calls right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8484880","8485880"," Hold on."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8488880","8493880"," Three thirty five."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8493880","8502880"," We'll see if the bulls have it here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8502880","8507880"," Bulls have one hour from four from three thirty to four thirty to put this together."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8519880","8524880"," Just show 50,000 gain gains and in spinning."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8524880","8528880"," I did show gains once on fin to it or twice."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8528880","8536880"," And I showed like proof and then showed all the actually printed out everything to show bona fides."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8536880","8538880"," And then I was told not to ever do that again."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8538880","8540880"," So I don't do it anymore."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8541880","8548880"," Yeah."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8548880","8549880"," Payback for very short here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8549880","8551880"," Can I take on February 1st 2nd."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8551880","8552880"," I have old Georgia."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8552880","8553880"," Yeah, man."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8553880","8556880"," I mean, I mean, my first two trades, I made money today."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8556880","8557880"," So I did good."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8557880","8563880"," But I'm down here trying to fuck around with this dip or this bottom down here and they're just cutting me up all the way down here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8563880","8567880"," Cut me fucking up here, cut me up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8567880","8571880"," And I fucking hate holding calls overnight."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8571880","8576880"," You know, like the one thing I don't want to see into tomorrow, it's this, you know, the, you know, the hate."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8576880","8578880"," We're in a bull market."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8578880","8582880"," You know what we would see is shit like this."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8582880","8590880"," You see shit like this, like you'll think this is the dip and then it's right here on this open and it blasts off like a hundred fucking points."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8591880","8598880"," So, you know, it's like in for a thousand bucks right now on tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8598880","8609880"," But like if I go full tit like five grand here and then go five grand on the open tomorrow, that's like $15,000 now trying to chase a few thousand in losses."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8609880","8611880"," You know, I don't know if it's here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8611880","8613880"," I don't know if it's down here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8613880","8618880"," You know, and you get fuckery inside of this fucking after hours and pre market."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8618880","8622880"," Fucking Europors don't show back up and you're like, God damn it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8622880","8630880"," Matter of fact, but yesterday in the stream yesterday, we were talking about the Europors and I was like, nah, they'll sell that shit right down."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8630880","8633880"," And they did, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8633880","8637880"," Now trading 10 cents on 400 C."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8637880","8645880"," Come on, dude, just pay me 10 cents on 400 C for today."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8645880","8649880"," I'm not fucking selling, not selling, not selling, not selling."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8649880","8652880"," Somebody call a dealer and tell them I'm not selling."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8659880","8662880"," Will I hold today? Yeah, I want to hold. Definitely."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8662880","8664880"," Well, it depends."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8664880","8672880"," If we trade this into the close or kind of nonsense after hours, that will take my winnings and be flat."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8673880","8678880"," I would not be caught dead long tomorrow if we're up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8678880","8683880"," If we're up here, fuck no."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8683880","8685880"," I wouldn't."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8685880","8691880"," If we trade up here into tomorrow or at like 4.15 six o'clock."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8691880","8699880"," So if we start trading up here in this bell, I'm fucking out."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8699880","8701880"," So they're like the natural place to short this."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8701880","8708880"," I mean, there's like weak sellers here, but the true sellers, like the really the big sellers, they're right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8708880","8710880"," So like we start trading up in here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8710880","8713880"," All that's asking for is a short in the overnight."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8713880","8718880"," That's all it's asking for. Just begging for it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8718880","8723880"," If I was a pajama trader, I'd be like, bring me 401.85 so I can short it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8723880","8728880"," That's the safest, the safest trade right now for an overnight trader."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8728880","8730880"," Is right up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8730880","8732880"," It'd be teeing off this all night long."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8732880","8736880"," If we got up here in the overnight, it'd be teeing off this in the overnight."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8736880","8739880"," I don't trade futures right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8739880","8743880"," Try not to, but this is like where you get."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8743880","8751880"," If you see a straight up there, that's like, it's not automatic short, but it's like one with risk on and a stop above it for sure."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8751880","8753880"," Maybe it's maybe it squeezes for a minute."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8753880","8757880"," You just jump on it, take that shit down."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8757880","8759880"," But definitely up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8759880","8765880"," Now trading 13 cents on some shit calls I have."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8765880","8767880"," They're trying to negotiate with you."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8767880","8769880"," They're like, look it, just take 13 cents."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8769880","8771880"," I'm like, I'll take 60 cents."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8771880","8772880"," They're like, no, how about 30?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8772880","8774880"," I'm like, all right, I'll take 30."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8774880","8778880"," Then they're like, all right, they start coming up to like 13 cents or something like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8778880","8779880"," Eight cents and like, how about nine?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8779880","8780880"," I'm like, nope."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8780880","8782880"," Now they're like, this is a joke, by the way."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8782880","8783880"," This isn't real."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8783880","8786880"," They're not actually telling me that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8787880","8791880"," What they're trying to do is just torch my fucking zero dates."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8791880","8795880"," They don't care about my zero dates."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8799880","8801880"," Yeah, they're 10 cents right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8801880","8802880"," I'm still on them."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8802880","8803880"," I'm so embarrassed."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8803880","8804880"," Embalance."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8804880","8806880"," Three hundred and fifty seven million to the sell song."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8806880","8808880"," Yeah, I don't care about your sell side and bounce."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8808880","8812880"," Your sell side and bounce means we probably go up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8817880","8824880"," Okay."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8824880","8827880"," Starting to get a nice bull cross right now in the one and five minute."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8832880","8835880"," We're now almost in the money on these four hundred C's."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8835880","8837880"," They're 10 cents right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8837880","8839880"," I want to jump up and get that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8839880","8842880"," Watch them only pay like twenty six cents or something."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8843880","8845880"," We're right on the money line here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8845880","8848880"," Eleven cents and they're saying they're going to pay me twenty two cents."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8848880","8851880"," So that's thirty three cents if we hit four hundred."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8851880","8853880"," They're like thirty three cents right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8853880","8856880"," Up here would be like fifty or sixty cents."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8856880","8858880"," Some kind of stupid nonsense up in here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8860880","8861880"," Come on, baby."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8862880","8863880"," Show me the."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8863880","8864880"," I won't swear."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8864880","8865880"," Show me the money."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8866880","8868880"," If any of you are don't like swearing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8868880","8873880"," I am going to look for a bot that will beep me swearing on stream."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8873880","8875880"," I wrote it down last night."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8875880","8877880"," I've got a sign here in my wall."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8880880","8884880"," I have a sign I wrote myself that says stop swearing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8886880","8889880"," They wrote a sign the other day that said stop swearing in stream."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8890880","8891880"," You have to clean it up a little bit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8893880","8896880"," I got to repost that sign that says stop swearing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8899880","8901880"," So I'll stop swearing I promise."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8902880","8903880"," I'll try to get up."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8903880","8908880"," I'll try to get a beeper to like beep out like a bot that just goes beep beep beep."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8908880","8909880"," Every time he swears."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8913880","8915880"," Does it have a live beep button?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8915880","8916880"," Okay."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8916880","8917880"," I'll look for it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8917880","8919880"," I don't have the stream deck, but maybe I'll get it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8920880","8922880"," I was thinking about getting the stream deck."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8922880","8923880"," Should I get it?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8923880","8924880"," Does anybody out there ever use the stream deck?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8925880","8926880"," Anybody know what that is?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8927880","8930880"," It's like this special thing that you can hit buttons and stuff on."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8932880","8936880"," I do it all with a with a mouse in my keyboard."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8944880","8945880"," I'll take a poll."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8945880","8946880"," Wiki."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8946880","8951880"," Can you do a poll on YouTube and you take a poll on YouTube and Twitch."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8951880","8952880"," We're getting trouble on Twitch."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8953880","8954880"," If I swear."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8955880","8958880"," From YouTube told me so YouTube was like we're changed the rules."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8960880","8961880"," YouTube's like here's the deal."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8961880","8962880"," We changed the rules."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8962880","8963880"," They're like you can't swear anymore."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8964880","8966880"," And I'm like well that sucks."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8968880","8974880"," And they were like well you can swear, but it can only be so many swears per hour."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8974880","8976880"," And I'm like oh we'll shoot them on seven hours a day."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8977880","8979880"," How many swears can I do in seven hours a day?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","8979880","8983880"," What's my can I save them up all day long until I'm losing money at the end of the day."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8983880","8985880"," And then start swearing for an hour."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8994880","8995880"," I kid you not."
"hieKIv8-UO4","8996880","9000880"," I'm like so if my average over seven hours is under the limit I'm good right."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9001880","9003880"," I guess I couldn't cut that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9005880","9006880"," Alexa quiet."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9010880","9016880"," Yeah I do have the 18 plus restriction."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9016880","9017880"," This is for adults."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9018880","9021880"," I don't talk about anything bad happening to people."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9022880","9023880"," I don't wish bad on anybody."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9024880","9026880"," I've done enough of that in the military so."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9028880","9032880"," Yeah they're gonna grind this right into the clothes aren't they they're gonna kill my calls here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9034880","9035880"," They're gonna murder them."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9035880","9036880"," I can already see it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9037880","9040880"," Trading six cents on four hundred C. They're not gonna let these calls print guaranteed."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9040880","9041880"," Not guaranteed but."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9042880","9044880"," Likely trade here into the bell."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9044880","9045880"," It's three forty four."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9045880","9046880"," We only have fifteen minutes left."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9048880","9051880"," Ninety ninety percent probability we close right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9052880","9054880"," Ninety percent probability we close right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9055880","9056880"," You probably have ninety five."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9056880","9059880"," I'll give it ninety seven percent probability we close right here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9059880","9062880"," Three percent probability that we squeeze up into this bell."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9063880","9065880"," I'm still long calls for tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9065880","9067880"," I'm not gonna sum the fact that we're down this low."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9068880","9069880"," I'm gonna hold those calls in the overnight."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9070880","9072880"," They're not a huge stack of money."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9073880","9075880"," It's like a thousand bucks or some nine hundred and some dollars."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9077880","9080880"," So I'm gonna hold these into tomorrow for a trade higher."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9080880","9083880"," I'm assuming that we're gonna get the dealers in here in the overnight."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9084880","9086880"," There is a risk that we sell down to."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9087880","9091880"," There's a risk that banks believe it or not banks and edge funds."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9092880","9093880"," We'll try to slip us underneath."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9095880","9096880"," The monthly moving average."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9097880","9098880"," Which is definitely a problem."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9099880","9100880"," Not probably a possibility."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9101880","9102880"," But I'm trying to make some money back."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9103880","9104880"," I don't care what this guy is saying."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9105880","9106880"," That means nothing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9107880","9108880"," Into tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9109880","9112880"," I want you to know that we can sell down onto the open down at that monthly trigger."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9113880","9114880"," They'll slip."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9114880","9116880"," Oftentimes they're at the bottom of some kind."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9117880","9118880"," You will see."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9118880","9120880"," Remember when February 28th and the end of the month."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9120880","9123880"," I was sitting there waiting for the last minute of the cash market."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9124880","9126880"," And I said we haven't hit these lows that we need to hit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9127880","9131880"," They did a 30 point move down the last minute of the month."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9132880","9134880"," And so you'll sometimes see that bullshit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9135880","9138880"," The last you'll see that shit when they're trying to get a pin strike down below."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9139880","9141880"," Okay, so I want you to be aware of that and tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9141880","9144880"," It's very risky to hold anything overnight going into tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9145880","9147880"," But for me, I'm trying to make some losses back."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9148880","9149880"," So I'm a red week here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9149880","9153880"," This is also a time where."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9154880","9156880"," It doesn't feel good doing this."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9156880","9161880"," I want you to know, like inside of me how I feel right now is revolt."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9161880","9168880"," I have this a real deep seated fear of holding calls overnight here because I've taken losses today."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9169880","9172880"," And when you take losses, it doesn't feel good."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9172880","9173880"," You feel."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9174880","9180880"," You feel like you know, I've lost and I'm just going to sit back and let the market play out."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9181880","9184880"," And I can't like I have to try to make this money back."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9185880","9190880"," Not miss that move and try to make that money back when I in the past when I've done that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9190880","9194880"," I'll end up missing a squeeze higher and some like always in the wrong side of a trade."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9194880","9198880"," So if I'm on the wrong side of the trade, I can't stay on the wrong side of the trade."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9198880","9199880"," Does that make sense?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9200880","9206880"," So if you've got so if I'm a so if I'm here in the markets here and I'll say I'm buying puts here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9207880","9210880"," Right. I'm buying puts here and we go up."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9211880","9214880"," And I sit on my hands because I'm all but hurt."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9215880","9217880"," Right. So we go up here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9218880","9221880"," Right. Let's say I'm in puts here. Right. I'm in puts. We go up."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9223880","9224880"," Right. I get torched."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9225880","9228880"," Right. So I don't buy puts a second time."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9228880","9233880"," We actually go down and I say fuck I missed it twice."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9233880","9235880"," Does that make sense? And then we go up."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9235880","9237880"," So you're always in the wrong side of a trade."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9237880","9242880"," If you get into that pattern, it becomes very it becomes like very self destructive."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9243880","9246880"," So for me, I have to take this trade."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9246880","9251880"," It's tomorrow to make sure I'm not make sure like the second trade that I don't want to lose."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9251880","9256880"," I don't want to squeeze up higher and then be buying calls in the open and be chasing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9257880","9261880"," So from in this doesn't feel good buying this close right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9261880","9263880"," For me, it doesn't feel good."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9263880","9266880"," Now we're trading three cents on 400 C's."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9266880","9268880"," We've got 13 minutes left."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9269880","9274880"," But I am going to hold calls into tomorrow for a squeeze higher and try to make this money back that I'm losing today."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9275880","9280880"," I'm fucking down. I haven't looked because I have to look at my activity for the day and see what the fuck I lost."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9280880","9284880"," But I'm probably down total on the day 20."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9284880","9286880"," It's roughly 25 or a bucks or something like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9287880","9292880"," I got to I know I've got two wins at this trade right here is going to cost me almost five grand."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9293880","9294880"," I know that for sure."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9295880","9298880"," I know this is going to cost me five fucking grand on the day."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9298880","9300880"," So I'm not happy at all."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9300880","9302880"," That's why I'm drinking whiskey right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9303880","9306880"," But again, I can't fucking win every trade."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9306880","9309880"," I'm never going to win every trade, especially livestreaming."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9309880","9310880"," You guys, I'm not."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9310880","9315880"," You're never going to see me like come out and tell you like you go to people get on social media and they're like I called this."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9315880","9316880"," I called that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9316880","9317880"," I called this."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9317880","9318880"," I knew this was happening."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9318880","9319880"," I still lost money today."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9320880","9321880"," I knew we were rolling over."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9321880","9326880"," I knew we were going to retest the daily trigger and still I took a bad trade."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9327880","9332880"," Took a bad fucking trade into this fucking bottom down here trying to try to buy this dip down here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9332880","9335880"," You know, so it serves as a good lesson at least."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9336880","9341880"," It serves as a good lesson that you can lose even when you know where you're going."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9362880","9364880"," What's going on with mods?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9366880","9368880"," I missed all this."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9369880","9372880"," What's the, what's the mod stuff that I would miss?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9379880","9382880"," It says, did I miss some comments or something?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9388880","9389880"," Did I miss it?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9389880","9390880"," Did I miss some comments inside something home?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9390880","9391880"," You look."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9392880","9393880"," Did I miss something here?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9393880","9394880"," Hold on, maybe I missed something."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9400880","9404880"," Can I comment on position size for options as a percentage of your portfolio?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9404880","9412880"," I usually trade size like 30 grand or so and they just spend like 30,000 or so on call spreads."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9412880","9419880"," And then I try to build a day trading account up from a thousand bucks to roughly 30 anywhere from 15 to $30,000."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9419880","9424880"," They take that money off the table and try to restart again at a thousand bucks every time."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9439880","9441880"," Oh, that's sizing somewhere in there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9441880","9444880"," I used to buy size all at one go."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9444880","9446880"," That was being asked questions."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9446880","9449880"," So I used to start trades with one to 300 contracts."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9449880","9451880"," I don't do that anymore."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9451880","9459880"," I feel as I used to start with one to 300 contracts and level up or leg up to like 100 to 300, 100 to 300, 100 300."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9459880","9464880"," And then I felt the zos being tracked by order full of sellers."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9464880","9467880"," I think my brokers were watching me and shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9467880","9469880"," I wasn't getting good bills."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9470880","9474880"," I'd get a fill and then I'd lose like five pennies in a millisecond on the fill."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9474880","9477880"," So I was pretty pissed off about it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9477880","9479880"," It'd be like down five, 15 grand stuff like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9479880","9485880"," And I'd be really pissed off after like a month and a half, three months of that shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9485880","9488880"," I was like, they gave me money back a few times."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9488880","9489880"," No, twice."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9489880","9491880"," I think they gave money back the third time."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9491880","9492880"," I was like, that's it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9492880","9493880"," I'm fucking done."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9494880","9507880"," So now I trade 10 contracts at a time trying to work up to 50 to 100 contracts in total on each trade on day trading at least somewhere in there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9507880","9513880"," Right around right around a thousand bucks to five grand somewhere in there if I can."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9524880","9528880"," I didn't see any of that chat."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9528880","9529880"," I don't."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9529880","9530880"," I don't."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9530880","9535880"," The chat that I see is either delayed or I don't always have the time to read it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9535880","9539880"," Yeah, they're going to pin it right into the spell here."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9543880","9545880"," I got 87 cents right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9545880","9548880"," I'm down 10% on 400 sees for tomorrow."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9548880","9551880"," I'm actually feeling good about that trade right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9552880","9557880"," I'm at one penny right now and 400 see they torched my fucking calls."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9557880","9558880"," One fucking penny."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9558880","9560880"," I'm going to let him go to zero."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9560880","9562880"," This is when like anger comes in."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9562880","9565880"," I'm like, yeah, fuck 300 bucks, fuck 500 bucks."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9565880","9568880"," I get kind of angry about that shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9576880","9578880"," Yeah, I don't I don't bother anymore."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9579880","9584880"," If I make a bad trade, if I don't have a if I don't have a stop on it or I don't finger stop it."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9584880","9587880"," And it goes like where I'm getting fucking torched."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9587880","9589880"," I'd rather just let it run."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9589880","9593880"," Enough of those print that it it balances out down the road."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9593880","9595880"," It recovers all those losses."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9599880","9601880"," Dude, negative $80,000."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9601880","9603880"," What the fuck?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9604880","9608880"," Yeah, dude, if you're if you're down 80,000, you shouldn't be trading with real money."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9608880","9611880"," I'll be honest with you, I'm not going to be."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9611880","9618880"," You should stop trading immediately and start paper trading or something or back testing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9618880","9620880"," There's a great website called."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9620880","9623880"," I think I post this sometimes."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9623880","9628880"," It's called, let me see what the name of the site is."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9629880","9631880"," You need to back test your shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9631880","9636880"," You need to have high probability winners."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9636880","9639880"," Let me see if I can get to the name of the site."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9644880","9647880"," You can't be if you're like."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9647880","9654880"," I don't know how to explain this, but you need to have like a trade that wins every time for you."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9654880","9657880"," You fuck around day trading or something like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9657880","9659880"," That's that's from those winnings."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9659880","9662880"," The percentage of my account that I trade with."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9662880","9665880"," Three to five percent somewhere in there."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9665880","9668880"," My account roughly runs that I trade with roughly runs a hundred grand."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9668880","9670880"," Give or take."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9670880","9671880"," So it's right."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9671880","9673880"," Then I don't scale up either."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9673880","9677880"," So I start like I got a thousand bucks."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9677880","9680880"," I try to get it to 15 to 30 day trading."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9680880","9685880"," If I don't like I don't like take a thousand, make five grand."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9685880","9689880"," And then like take a five thousand dollar trade day trading."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9689880","9692880"," So you have to scale up as you're trading to that number."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9692880","9696880"," As a matter of fact, if I blow this account up."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9696880","9699880"," Or if I restart it again, I'll say something."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9699880","9703880"," I'll make sure that I say something started a thousand bucks again."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9708880","9712880"," No, well, I have, well, no, my account and my money is different."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9712880","9717880"," So I have two accounts, well, three accounts, but one account is not being spent right now."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9717880","9720880"," I've got a stock buying accounts."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9720880","9726880"," The last thing that I owned was a hundred shares of Tesla at, I believe, $133."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9726880","9729880"," 133 and some change. And then I sold it at two, 14."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9729880","9737880"," And that's a stock. And then, of course, you've got your bank account that your wife has."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9737880","9741880"," You've got, you know, my wife is like a doctor and shit."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9741880","9746880"," So she's got her fucking money. And then you've got, I own houses."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9746880","9751880"," I've got a business accounts for those houses that has their own money."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9751880","9755880"," Like, you know, you have like different shit for."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9755880","9762880"," I've got a, I've got a, you know, like financial advisor that wants me to give him my money and I tell him to go fuck a stick."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9762880","9764880"," That kind of stuff."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9765880","9771880"," I got money tied up in property that I pull out of the market so that it appreciates."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9771880","9780880"," I'm trying to answer questions."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9780880","9786880"," Day training is this kind of thing where before we end up with the broadcast,"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9786880","9789880"," we've got four minutes left for you in the broadcast."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9790880","9793880"," So think of somebody that works at a job."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9793880","9796880"," And they get a paycheck every week."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9796880","9799880"," And it's 800,000 bucks."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9799880","9801880"," So they work every week, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9801880","9805880"," They can come to the stock market and risk it all."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9805880","9808880"," At worst, they lose all their money for that week, right?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9808880","9813880"," They have a chance of making 10, 20, $30,000."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9813880","9818880"," If they can do that 30 times and they make 1000, they're doing quite well."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9819880","9828880"," Now, most of you that have a job where you work every week and you're getting torched and you hit that 30,000 winner, you think you're a pro trader, but you're not."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9828880","9841880"," You need to take that 30 grand and remove it from the market immediately and put it into something that's a winner or brings you money so that you can then go back and fund your day trading that you're doing."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9841880","9849880"," So there's like a disconnect between when you or how and when and how you do these things."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9849880","9851880"," So do you understand the disconnect?"
"hieKIv8-UO4","9851880","9855880"," The disconnect is this is that you're working a job where you make a thousand bucks a week."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9855880","9859880"," You take your 30 grand that you made and you go, I'm a great trader."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9859880","9865880"," So you sigh, you size that up from a grand to five grand to 15 grand to 10 grand, whatever the fuck it is."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9865880","9868880"," And you blow that account up and then you're back to."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9869880","9871880"," Thousand bucks a week from your job or something like that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9871880","9872880"," You can't do that."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9872880","9879880"," You have to remove the money from the market and have it make you money somewhere else and you have to discipline yourself to get back to a thousand dollars again."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9879880","9880880"," You have to."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9880880","9896880"," So if you take 29 cuts to making it one grand, you make more, you have a better chance of keeping your money than I'm going to assume that any of you that have lost $80,000 or 100 grand or 10 grand or 30 grand."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9896880","9905880"," Most surely size up your trades guaranteed and guaranteed, you don't pull the money out of the market into an appreciable asset."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9905880","9907880"," Almost guaranteed."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9907880","9910880"," It's it's it's not even the debt."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9910880","9914880"," And I pay my debt down to so I'm down to I have a little bit of debt left."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9914880","9919880"," I got two or two things left at the payoff, but otherwise I have paid all my debt down."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9927880","9929880"," My net worth. I don't have net worth."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9929880","9934880"," You guys do realize that when you're not poor that you don't own anything."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9934880","9937880"," You know that right it's all in trust."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9937880","9938880"," There's no net worth."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9938880","9941880"," There's no such thing as well I guess there is for some people."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9941880","9943880"," You don't you don't ever keep net worth."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9943880","9945880"," You get sued for net worth."
"hieKIv8-UO4","9945880","9948880"," You don't own shit."
