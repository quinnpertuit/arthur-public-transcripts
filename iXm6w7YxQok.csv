"1200820","1202220"," High volume buying."
"1202840","1206020"," Three month bills and awards, 37, spot 9, 4% of bids at high."
"1206380","1207740"," India, Oscar, November. "
"1208820","1210820"," High rate of four, spot 8, 9%."
"1210820","1215340"," So the U.S selling 53 billion dollars of six month bills and awards 96, spot 4."
"1215380","1216680"," Cupid, oh, I'll be quiet here."
"1217440","1218440"," I-O-N-Q. "
"1220560","1223560"," Sorry, I'm not trying to interrupt the squacker guy."

"1242660","1245480"," You all are out there trying to- trying to catch knives."
"1247040","1249060"," I don't know why you're trying to catch knives."
"1251720","1256200"," It's better to know that hedge funds are buying these companies up. "
"1257460","1259800"," If there's real money coming into a ticker."
"1277590","1279850"," Now this one here is a little complicated."
"1281450","1283750"," This one right here has a bull cross. "
"1284830","1285610"," Right here."
"1288870","1293650"," That doesn't mean these, like, like, so this is a prime example, like, you don't want to, like,"
"1294010","1297070"," take this and hold for this nice measured move higher."
"1297970","1304910"," But you could possibly take this trade to like three dollars and 30 cents or so. "
"1305330","1308990"," But if it breaks above and holds and consolidates, there's a second trade in here."
"1311870","1317310"," If it fails in here, though, you could set an alert to buy down here with stops down here."
"1317390","1317690"," Makes sense. "
"1321650","1325990"," This one's a little bit trickier, but there's a lot of- there's, like, two things going on in here."
"1326130","1329590"," There's no buyers here."
"1331410","1336250"," Oh, there's some resistance, of course, here, but declining resistance. "
"1337790","1341870"," And even if it fails, it's looking like it wants to explode at some point to new highs."
"1343990","1344210"," Fit."
"1345950","1347450"," That's five picks for you. "
"1365090","1366010"," Five picks."
"1366750","1368150"," I'll go through them one more time."
"1368170","1369330"," We already talked about Dash. "
"1370550","1379910"," D-A-S-H-T-O-S-T-O-S-C-R-I-O-N-Q-F-I-P."
