"7690","11490"," It was just that exchange offer never found tapers yet."
"11570","13510"," The arms never got into this field."
"14150","18250"," But anyway, just, I thought, I made it weird that they chose to wing it after. "
"18410","23110"," I guess it would seem gratuitous unless they felt there's value in, you know, putting that flag out"
"23110","27190"," there and saying this is the kind of thing if you're considering it, we wouldn't look too kind."
"27450","28250"," That is the reason."
"28670","30990"," That is the reason we're trying to stay relevant I guess over there. "
"31530","34950"," Meanwhile, I also are in the travel space at Goldman initiating some of the cruise lines."
"35330","37450"," They go to buy RCL and CCL."
"37810","41910"," They talk about this bear case that's been emerging regarding sort of a wind down of the pent up"
"41910","42250"," demand. "
"42690","47730"," But they argue that there's better pricing initiatives, more structural things going on in the"
"47730","47970"," business."
"48150","48750"," They keep them bullish."
"49130","52070"," The other thing is this page one New York Times piece about that. "
"52070","52930"," Good morning out there."
"53030","53650"," How are y'all doing?"
"54250","55710"," I'm going to eat this really quick."
"71320","78230"," Nice fucking taste and I don't like this goddamn format either. "
"78530","84610"," All right, here we go."
"85030","85450"," Mic check."
"85730","86230"," Check one two. "
"89730","91690"," What's going on out there everybody?"
"92210","93010"," Good morning."
"95250","97450"," We got a lot of weird stuff going on."
"97590","98410"," Oh, not weird stuff. "
"98790","99770"," We'll talk about it this morning."
"100950","101970"," Check one two."
"102170","103010"," Ooh, hot coffee. "
"103390","106390"," I've got hot coffee, baby."
"108550","113030"," I guess we'll start."
"113270","114790"," It will start the opening position. "
"116370","117810"," Everybody's piling in right now."
"135560","137300"," Oh, good morning out there."
"137420","137620"," Everybody. "
"137640","138160"," How are y'all doing?"
"138160","141300"," We're going to go straight to the opening bell just for positioning."
"146160","150060"," Last night, if we're going to switch the market brief and come back to it in just a moment."
"150700","153100"," But just for the open this morning here. "
"153220","153500"," Good morning."
"153600","154440"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"154540","157220"," Good to see you just for the open this morning."
"157740","162020"," If you had read the market brief on trade the trigger.com."
"162940","171060"," You would have seen that I gave you a sell the open market brief, which we got. "
"172520","173600"," So there it is, right?"
"173840","174240"," Sell the open."
"174780","177420"," And we're now underneath the half hour trigger."
"177580","178940"," It doesn't mean that this doesn't get bought. "
"179880","182860"," So that market brief, I want to let you know a little bit something about it."
"184640","186160"," So, first things first."
"186460","187320"," Let's start back here. "
"187620","190820"," So yesterday, this close, right?"
"191060","192640"," See right here, this close right here."
"194200","197320"," You start buying it up, buying it up, buying it up into the bell."
"197860","199680"," And we did get a really nice run up here. "
"200720","204500"," But we didn't get the the creepy crawl."
"204760","207300"," It was beautiful, but it didn't like straight up get it."
"207500","209540"," Didn't go right up there and slam up. "
"210140","212720"," On 5,200 on SPX, right?"
"212960","220280"," So when you lose that momentum like this, you look towards the last known place of fires for that"
"220280","222000"," momentum to kick back in again, right?"
"222740","227820"," So we know that yesterday they were down right down in here, right?"
"229000","230600"," That's when they were right down in here."
"230760","231520"," So we know they're here."
"231660","237560"," They could step in before, and especially as time has passed on the half an hour trigger, the"
"237560","239040"," hourly trigger coming up. "
"239360","241500"," These are places to look for the buyers."
"243300","247200"," To this first place here in the half an hour trigger, you got another place down here in the hourly"
"247200","247580"," trigger."
"247580","252080"," And then just this little squeeze up down here, okay?"
"252240","260000"," So it's right down to this 5, 14 and change zone demos, a little tiny gap right there. "
"260720","263580"," There's some gapage right here that needs to be closed, that kind of stuff."
"263800","264880"," So I wouldn't be getting all buried up."
"265040","268500"," Some people are out there on Twitter and they're like, murder. "
"269140","270760"," I'm like, whoa, come down."
"272120","274540"," Now we have a, we have a couple things here."
"274600","275540"," Think about the mechanics of this. "
"275940","278780"," So you have a momentum pushing us up into supply, right?"
"279480","282380"," We have a pin at 5,200, right?"
"282960","288760"," So you have this magnet up there that's pulling us up into 5,200, and they're going to park the"
"288760","292400"," bus here for triple witching."
"292720","298260"," They also parked the bus on the last day of the month, which I think is the 29th of 28th."
"298820","305820"," So you have two different magnets for the end of quarter coming up. "
"306560","310640"," So, so, and so then I'm thinking about, I'm like, yeah, you know, Wednesday, nothing going on."
"310960","317280"," We got a little bit of all 1 p.m. in the afternoon, but we do have data on Thursday"
"317280","318480"," and Friday morning."
"318940","324520"," So if we have a pin at 5,200, you know, we could just sit here and be parked or"
"324520","330220"," blast up today and park it at 5,200 or we pull back a little bit just to account for"
"330220","335140"," that volatility into Thursday and Friday morning, right?"
"335380","339400"," Then we just ramp up on that 5,200 at the end of the day on Friday. "
"339620","341320"," So, and we lost the momentum yesterday."
"341460","343340"," So it's not like we're not going to be up there."
"343340","347960"," And it's not like that wall can't come down between now and Friday either at 5,200. "
"348240","348960"," We can go above it."
"349540","351380"," We all know all things are possible."
"352660","354920"," Nothing is, you know, definite. "
"355720","359820"," But the point being would be this would be there is a magnet at 5,200."
"360780","362540"," It's also a door that's locked."
"362920","371340"," Now they can become unlocked if the call the call market expands to the upside. "
"371340","374720"," Like people start loading up on millions of calls and stuff like that."
"375400","377500"," Five 30s, five 40s, five 50s."
"377620","379420"," It's just likely not to happen right now. "
"380380","382720"," These banks are going to part this shit, make their money."
"383500","385660"," You're going to sit back and just watch as it happens."
"386560","390220"," I know that I see people and fit into it this morning saying market crash this morning. "
"390820","394340"," Not not Jedi, but other people are like, we're going to fucking crash this morning."
"394340","398360"," I'm like, dude, I'm like, you have a whole fucking quarter to do it."
"399020","402480"," And you're going to crash the market this morning, like this week. "
"403400","404440"," Like calm down."
"406980","408100"," Calm down."
"408780","411900"," There's a ton of shit expiring on Friday. "
"412840","415120"," It's not this is not the time when it happens."
"415840","417640"," It could, but it's not."
"418000","420300"," It's not normally the time that it happens. "
"421480","423240"," So just let them do their things."
"423260","424720"," Let these algorithms do their things."
"424840","426280"," If that shit were to happen, right?"
"426960","431900"," I mean, you're talking about like, you know, somebody asked, I asked his questions all the time,"
"432160","436480"," like, you know, like, no. "
"437720","440140"," You're not bankrupting a dealer."
"442000","445640"," You're not bankrupting the fucking liquidity providers out there."
"447160","450700"," And you weren't going to do it when we didn't have computers. "
"451480","456040"," You know, if you're, if you're watching documentaries on the flash, or the crash of 87."
"456920","461460"," It wasn't a flash crash, but it was blamed on a bunch of different shit, but you know, they will"
"461460","462320"," make a fucking market."
"462940","466360"," You know, why would you ever want to bankrupt the dealer?"
"466640","469160"," Anyways, they provide liquidity to the market. "
"470060","471700"," And let's look at one other thing."
"472120","476380"," It's very rare to see prime bank go bankrupt."
"476700","476920"," They do. "
"477240","479840"," They usually do, though, not the stock market."
"480440","482380"," You know, they'll do crazy things, right?"
"482540","486220"," They take on risk and places they're supposed to, not the stock market."
"486480","491220"," Like that the stock market has become something that they own. "
"491560","494320"," They didn't always own, well, that was a whole bunch of stuff."
"495820","502780"," Like the idea behind the stock market in general was to protect commodities, right?"
"503160","509260"," Farmers, believe it or not, protect the buyers of commodities and things like that."
"509500","512520"," And it grew over the years that we only still have calls. "
"512860","514240"," We didn't even have puts at one time."
"514400","514880"," Did you know that?"
"516080","522340"," If you don't know that stuff, we are starting an educational series that will delve into like the"
"522340","528320"," history of calls and puts and stocks and shares and the differences and all this kind of stuff."
"529160","531120"," We're going to start like square one. "
"532360","534220"," It should be a fun thing."
"534380","537220"," But anyways, it's just like this right now, right?"
"538380","541020"," The stock market is not for you anymore."
"541580","544560"," The stock market is for or not anymore either. "
"544700","551280"," The stock market is not for you."
"551280","552760"," The stock market as much as they do now."
"554280","556360"," Now these have been a lot of bond markets. "
"556580","560620"," This was decades ago, decades and decades ago, but then they got involved in the stock market."
"561320","564840"," And a lot of the stock market is built for them."
"565300","570020"," We happen to play in their pond or their ocean. "
"570520","572540"," We're like small fish in their ocean."
"574400","584000"," So what's more fascinating too is you can actually see the chase for not so much risk, but yield"
"584000","587880"," by banks, prime banks over the decades."
"588800","590780"," These never be involved in housing, right?"
"591380","593640"," And you see them involved in housing now, right?"
"594140","600300"," The building houses, they want to be landlords, right?"
"600700","605260"," And this is all in that chase of yields, the chase of risk over the years. "
"606220","609820"," How do we get bigger and bigger and bigger, right?"
"610080","611480"," How do we exploit this?"
"612060","613800"," Now how do we exploit that?"
"614360","616960"," And how can we exploit this next big thing, right?"
"617920","621680"," You saw Jamie Diamond yesterday saying I'll defend your right to Bitcoin."
"622340","624300"," Makes me wonder if he owns a ton of it now, right?"
"625120","627020"," Like how do I exploit that?"
"627020","634020"," I don't like crypto unless I own it at zero, right?"
"635300","639340"," So just think about that when it comes to the stock market and think about some of the logic behind"
"639340","639600"," that."
"639780","640420"," I want to see this. "
"640680","643320"," I want to see dealers get destroyed or this yet."
"643540","645620"," So this is a function that we have every quarter."
"645620","646580"," We have it every month. "
"647080","647880"," We have it every quarter."
"648500","650740"," And sometimes things go right or go wrong."
"651360","655680"," But right now it's kind of like that just that weird time where you're like, yeah, this is where a"
"655680","657040"," full manipulation comes in. "
"657400","661080"," You're not going to, you're not, you can steal the money out of their pockets."
"662240","665780"," So this big fat, this isn't really, this isn't real."
"665940","671760"," I'm trying to be figured in here, but he has this big fat old white greasy haired bald fat guy,"
"671760","672120"," right?"
"672820","675320"," Not that fat's bad or anything, but you know the image, right?"
"675860","682480"," Like the meme of this, the greedy old man, he's got, you know, he's ugly and disgusting and the"
"682480","683520"," sweat's really not sweat. "
"683900","684740"," That's really not fat."
"684940","686700"," It's, that is excess, right?"
"686900","688120"," So it just represents excess."
"689660","694180"," You're not going to, you're not going to take all that man's money or woman or whoever it is. "
"694480","697660"," Like you're not going to, we're not going to, you're likely not going to break that person."
"698160","706320"," Your job as a retailer is when he pulls his, his clammy hand out of his pocket to just like"
"706320","708080"," wipe the sweat off it."
"708820","711480"," You know, you're just, that's his arbitrage, right?"
"711780","713020"," On, on every scale. "
"713500","718180"," You're just there to take a little bit from that person or that entity or that thought or that, or"
"718180","719620"," that idea of somebody."
"720760","722340"," And that's, that's your job, right?"
"722620","724860"," You're not going, you're not the bank is the point."
"725620","731800"," You're not the fat old greasy white creepy JPM, right?"
"732040","736560"," Or, you know, Morgan Stanley, you know, you're not that person. "
"736720","737920"," You're not ever going to be that person."
"737920","740900"," And when you try to be that person, you're going to get blown out."
"741540","746840"," So your job is like sneak up on that bank and when they're making their moves, you're following"
"746840","747760"," with them. "
"748440","749280"," Does that make sense?"
"750140","753040"," So don't fight what they're doing."
"753040","756780"," Try to find out what they're doing is the point of making to you."
"757320","758780"," Does it make sense to you guys out there?"
"759840","762120"," So anyways, positioning for this morning. "
"762520","763460"," And right now that's what they're doing."
"763600","767200"," Right now they are trying to harvest, right?"
"767200","767680"," Not just them."
"767800","768580"," There's hedge funds. "
"768620","769960"," There's CTA's."
"770060","773800"," There's very wealthy individuals."
"774220","775960"," There's also liquidity providers, right?"
"776480","778860"," You got a car, icon, right?"
"779100","780920"," You got all kinds of people. "
"780960","782160"," You got a bill Ackman."
"782380","783660"," They provide liquidity in the market."
"784180","788500"," Dealers actually go to them and say, we need money to sell people calls or puts. "
"789260","790220"," We need to provide liquidity."
"790280","791820"," We're going to give you your money back in a little bit."
"791880","793060"," We're the bottom right now. "
"794180","799100"," I'm going to call you on the phone and literally say to you, can you provide some liquidity so that"
"799100","802020"," I can sell these people puts."
"802160","803780"," They don't know they're about to bounce."
"804500","806460"," And I will get your money back to you in just a little bit. "
"807060","807560"," Okay, you're not."
"808880","810260"," Stuff like that happens."
"811280","813040"," So there's this is their function. "
"813200","813780"," This is what they're doing."
"813800","814340"," It's out of quarter."
"814680","815820"," It's triple witching coming up. "
"816020","818820"," We also have a bunch of contract sending stuff like that."
"818820","820460"," I don't expect me."
"820680","827540"," I don't expect to wake up on Friday and see the JPM blew up because you wanted the market to"
"827540","827800"," crash. "
"828400","833500"," And it take all their money from their level or their money out there."
"833720","834220"," This is my point."
"834780","836660"," I'm trying to simplify this or a dealer. "
"837740","840320"," You know, anyways, so right now."
"840760","841480"," It's apologize."
"841740","842860"," I'm going to think I might be getting sick. "
"843200","843860"," My daughter was sick."
"844000","846560"," I was in the hospital last night with her till very late last night."
"846560","848240"," She had an uncontrollable temperature. "
"850100","852260"," So right now we're underneath the half an hour trigger."
"853200","857260"," I would really like to buy down below here to really see just all this get closed."
"859040","862120"," And watch that watch this like parking the bus action. "
"863260","863720"," Right."
"863900","866320"," I'd really like to buy that if we start to go above again though."
"866980","869120"," If they actually do step in this morning. "
"870220","871560"," On the half an hour trigger."
"872780","876960"," Or if they step up this morning at the hourly trigger, I don't care."
"877960","879980"," I don't care if they step on this right here. "
"880200","881520"," What we do know is this though."
"882020","884060"," We do know where the buyers are, right?"
"884320","888760"," We know they're here, here, and the real true last buyers were down here yesterday."
"891560","892120"," Excuse me. "
"893200","894580"," So if they do buy this."
"895800","898260"," Let's say they buy the half an hour trigger this morning, right?"
"899580","903380"," If they do, you will like every day we do here, right?"
"903540","904100"," What would you see?"
"904840","911300"," If you think that the buyers are here right now, right where we are this moment."
"912180","913780"," Would you be buying calls here?"
"914160","914340"," No. "
"915360","917100"," You would be waiting for you."
"917200","918380"," I don't care if this goes down right now."
"918380","920520"," It doesn't matter what matters is where we are right here. "
"920680","922260"," This little moment right here."
"922360","922520"," Okay."
"923460","924860"," Would you be buying calls right here?"
"924980","925200"," No. "
"925200","930320"," You would be looking for those buyers to step in, right?"
"931160","934940"," Show their power to this prior high right here."
"935740","936820"," Come back down, right?"
"938460","940940"," You'd watch them come back up, right?"
"942400","945360"," Come back down and you'd watch that reversal to the upside."
"945640","946040"," Does that make sense?"
"946240","947140"," You start getting new highs. "
"947820","950320"," So we just delete this for a minute here just so you can see it."
"950420","950540"," Okay."
"951200","952640"," So right where we are right now. "
"953120","957240"," You would not be buying this where we think buyers might be, right?"
"958240","959660"," But watch how this happens."
"959660","962080"," So you would first see the buyers step in, right?"
"964200","969140"," You would first see the buyers that could be hidden buyers right here, right?"
"969680","970880"," And they would push price up."
"971760","974500"," And these last sellers right here, they would overtake them, right?"
"975140","976500"," So you get that new high right there. "
"977080","977920"," Come right back down."
"977920","982180"," And you'd see this one minute trigger come back up."
"982560","983160"," See what I'm saying?"
"984280","986220"," I didn't see that one minute trigger come back up. "
"986280","991280"," You'd see this five minute trigger slide underneath just like that."
"993200","994420"," And I should make the screen."
"994820","997940"," A little better right there. "
"999940","1000420"," Okay."
"1001320","1002540"," See price come back down."
"1005020","1006320"," Sellers come right back in again. "
"1006700","1008540"," That's these same sellers right here."
"1010460","1011680"," Right there right here now."
"1014880","1019460"," And you'd be watching the full plane form, right?"
"1019800","1021420"," So the buyers step, so the buyers are here. "
"1021780","1023060"," The buyers step right back in again."
"1023359","1026900"," And then you'd have the sellers try one more time over here, right?"
"1027720","1028599"," They're just right down in there."
"1028599","1032200"," And as that cross takes place, right?"
"1032900","1034859"," The buyers would come in one last time. "
"1036380","1041839"," And you'd get your your rip all the way up here and break past these sellers right here."
"1042020","1042420"," See that?"
"1043119","1046960"," And you can tell now that these sellers are being pushed around."
"1047300","1047380"," Okay. "
"1047740","1051480"," We would go up and you would jump in over here as a buyer."
"1051960","1052620"," We would go up."
"1053440","1053840"," Make sense?"
"1054700","1056320"," And you're on the right side of the trade. "
"1056320","1060600"," Now you can see right now that didn't happen, did it?"
"1060960","1062700"," Rook down underneath the half an hour trigger."
"1063600","1064100"," They trapped."
"1064620","1066480"," You see the weakness in buyers right here. "
"1066780","1068240"," And now we're rolling to the downside."
"1069000","1072800"," So we're going to check now this hourly trigger right here."
"1073920","1075880"," And that is that by 1526. "
"1078340","1078860"," Right."
"1079520","1085680"," And then we've got where Captain wants to buy where last known buyers were."
"1085680","1087980"," This was at one. "
"1088340","1090220"," Sixteen in the afternoon yesterday, right?"
"1090920","1092200"," I'd like to see that right there."
"1092300","1094700"," See a little gap down there right down there."
"1095580","1097040"," Now do I think we're getting down there?"
"1097300","1097580"," I don't know. "
"1098240","1098780"," No idea."
"1099780","1101880"," But this is where I want to buy them cheap, right?"
"1102220","1103020"," I'm going to buy some cheap."
"1103820","1106260"," And I already know that there's a."
"1108020","1108380"," A."
"1109700","1109880"," A."
"1110100","1110120"," A."
"1110120","1110200"," A."
"1110200","1110800"," it 5200. "
"1111700","1114340"," So let me show you one more thing really quick, right?"
"1115280","1120720"," I'm going to switch over, I'm in here, big kicked out."
"1121620","1124680"," Let me switch over to the bottom right screen."
"1126080","1127200"," So just right over here, right?"
"1127840","1128560"," You see this right here?"
"1130120","1131920"," This is SPX Gamma, right?"
"1132760","1138940"," Matter of fact, let me let me do one quick thing here. "
"1140120","1142840"," Let me get the data for this morning because I haven't done that."
"1144680","1151570"," We plug in some data here in one quick second here."
"1157010","1157970"," I love you guys. "
"1158130","1160570"," I want you to know something if you're out there."
"1161210","1162550"," I love all of you."
"1162830","1163290"," I really do. "
"1164870","1166030"," Alright, plug that in."
"1167250","1169170"," Let's take a look at the gamma picture."
"1169470","1171430"," So the gamma has moved up. "
"1171570","1172010"," Do you see that?"
"1173970","1174610"," Wait a minute."
"1174610","1175250"," Am I screwing that up?"
"1175390","1176050"," Hold on a second here."
"1176950","1177590"," Hang tight. "
"1177850","1178170"," Hang tight."
"1181290","1182430"," Let's try this one more time."
"1186390","1190290"," Anyways, we got a little bit of wonkiness going on, but we got the gamma flip moving up, right?"
"1191990","1194330"," We've got the gap to fill left down below here. "
"1194850","1195850"," This gap was never filled."
"1196470","1200990"," I would love to see that gap filled because I don't, I mean, this looks like we want to come"
"1200990","1202210"," back forward at some point, right?"
"1203210","1209870"," The fact that it wasn't filled bothers me for like, for continuation of the upside, that'll hold."
"1211470","1213430"," Let's take a peek down here and see what's down here. "
"1216750","1218170"," You see all this right here?"
"1218830","1219810"," Can you see that right there?"
"1219870","1221610"," It's at 1.30 in the afternoon, right?"
"1221750","1222430"," You see that right there?"
"1223050","1224590"," A little light right there, isn't it?"
"1225170","1226110"," So right down in here."
"1226990","1228630"," Take a look at that right there."
"1230810","1232710"," Push that over right there. "
"1234130","1240190"," The gamma flip is now at a 51.30. 51.50 is not great support, is it?"
"1240450","1242250"," See that 13 million, 12 million."
"1243130","1246390"," 51.30 is the best support way down here."
"1247290","1250990"," That's erasing this entire move right here, right?"
"1251070","1254270"," Not quite the gap, Bill, but this entire move. "
"1254490","1259870"," This is back on March 12th at 9.30 in the morning."
"1260190","1262150"," Imagine if we did that whole move right there."
"1262230","1262550"," Look at that. "
"1263070","1267250"," It's at 9, or that's at 9.57 yesterday."
"1270350","1273330"," So we know that this is weak down here, right?"
"1274630","1277090"," So we'll watch this and monitor this this morning."
"1277310","1278970"," See if we actually get down here or not. "
"1279410","1281170"," We might actually pull this all the way down here."
"1282470","1283610"," Right there."
"1283770","1285110"," Let's see what happens right there. "
"1286970","1288850"," See if we can remove all that."
"1289330","1290130"," Is that one o'clock in the afternoon?"
"1290450","1291550"," Yeah, it's one o'clock in the afternoon."
"1293610","1294630"," One o'clock in the afternoon. "
"1294670","1296190"," It kind of looks right, doesn't it?"
"1296370","1297150"," Maybe even over there."
"1299550","1300650"," Let's see how that goes."
"1302490","1303050"," All right. "
"1304950","1309670"," We're going to go to the the whole one second here."
"1310450","1313310"," Let's go back to the main screen really quick, I think."
"1314010","1314750"," Sorry about that. "
"1314810","1314950"," Hold on."
"1315070","1315790"," Give me one quick second."
"1320120","1322020"," Get rid of that because that was a lesson. "
"1322840","1327100"," And then let me bring up one more thing here."
"1327760","1329240"," We're going to go to the market brief."
"1329240","1330540"," We're a little out of order this morning. "
"1331100","1332020"," I apologize."
"1332860","1336300"," A little tiny bit out of order this morning."
"1338580","1343260"," So this morning, CNBC, CNBC this morning, the counter trade. "
"1346850","1352520"," Wells Fargo downgrades Tesla sees electric vehicles stock dropping nearly 30% from here."
"1352520","1358120"," So I made a call to you guys that should go down to $76."
"1359100","1362000"," I saw calls this morning for 40 bucks. "
"1362580","1363920"," So we'll take a look at that today."
"1364520","1367300"," I don't know if it's 40 or 46 or something like that."
"1367940","1373620"," We're going to take a look at two important gaps on Tesla today if we can get around to it. "
"1374260","1377800"," There's another problem here too, which is time is passing."
"1378380","1384900"," The ability to come up and squeeze the 200 between 200 and 260 is closing as time passes."
"1384900","1386660"," We talked about that yesterday as well. "
"1387180","1393100"," There's real danger to that downside move saying that the first stop is about 100 bucks."
"1393680","1403660"," Now I always hate when we know this stuff and then like these people come out"
"1403660","1410260"," and say it all it's like counter to what you want to see happen."
"1410920","1412880"," So we'll watch it and see what happens. "
"1412880","1415580"," We'll take a look at Tesla today to just show it to you."
"1415860","1421720"," If you're a pro trader with us, you already have all those expectations."
"1422220","1428940"," You should get those every week that shows those downside moves before they set it this morning. "
"1430740","1435200"," So anyways, if you're not a pro trader, whatever, we'll take a look at Tesla, but I don't like"
"1435200","1436000"," seeing this stuff."
"1436180","1442720"," When it gets overly especially bearish, I'm like, fuck too many people know."
"1443360","1446500"," So I get a little wary of it. "
"1447060","1448680"," Four squeeze to happen."
"1449900","1450960"," What else do we have here?"
"1451280","1455840"," Next to the other thing here too is NVDA this morning."
"1456260","1457580"," More garbage about NVDA. "
"1457960","1464700"," Earlier in the week, we had earlier last week, we had them, we had CNBC, Cleming Momentum was done"
"1464700","1465160"," in the market."
"1465420","1467660"," We can see this week, that's not the fucking case."
"1469340","1470880"," So we'll talk about that today. "
"1471300","1481060"," We probably need to talk about IWM and yeah, like all these cuts going on and Apple and Google"
"1481060","1488180"," and stuff like that and watching the IWM just like consolidate, consolidate, consolidate."
"1488560","1493440"," I'm like, man this is just ready for a fucking face ripper into the rate decision."
"1494800","1496800"," We'll discuss the rate decision if we can. "
"1496920","1504540"," If we have the time today, we'll discuss the rate decision and some kind of potential really big"
"1504540","1510400"," move to the upside that's being planned and why I don't know why it's got to be rate decision or"
"1510400","1515900"," just just maybe it's pricing in not this decision but the next one."
"1516360","1520180"," So we'll talk about that too with IWM and the mechanics of it."
"1520340","1522000"," What to watch for and that kind of stuff. "
"1523280","1525700"," Now at 1 p.m. today, we've got an auction."
"1527120","1530820"," What else do we have this morning from let's take a look at a financial juice."
"1531940","1532940"," What do we got this morning?"
"1533140","1541940"," We've got the NBA 30-year mortgage rate actual 6.4 forecast was 7.02. Wells Fargo now expects the"
"1541940","1544460"," Fed to start cutting rates in June versus May. "
"1544460","1549800"," I expected earlier we need to discuss that with the rate cuts and all that today too."
"1550800","1552020"," I'm on board."
"1553000","1558940"," I'm on board no like I'm I for the first time in a while I feel like uh they don't"
"1558940","1563580"," need to cut rates or not not that they don't need to curates no but uh not that I'm on"
"1563580","1570440"," board like yeah they're not going to cut rates at this rate decision and uh if they were to cut"
"1570440","1578940"," rates it's bad luck uh especially if they're telling you you're likely going to get a couple rate"
"1578940","1586500"," cuts this year and not back to back if they now that they've said that uh they made that known"
"1586500","1594060"," right so if there's no rush to cut rates you're going to expect uh two maybe three not back to"
"1594060","1603180"," back this year is if they stay on that path we're fine if they start doing like rate cut in"
"1603180","1610800"," March right rate cut in May rate cut in June be scared uh you should be scared as long as"
"1610800","1619020"," if the cooler you act uh the less danger there is the more aggressive they get the more day or"
"1619020","1625220"," the more danger there is there's other things to be watching as well um the the economic reports"
"1625220","1629160"," that are coming out we're just bouncing up bouncing down bouncing up bouncing down very slowly"
"1629160","1636620"," gently if you start to see aggressive like um in inflation coming down aggressively we slam down"
"1636620","1642820"," and slam up you start to see unemployment rates racing up you start to see jobs reports right"
"1642820","1649740"," they're they're just down down aggressive we have issues uh we will have issues if you start to see"
"1649740","1656440"," hi kitty good morning kitty you start to see uh you know like a bank go on CNBC or something"

"4479230","4485610"," really it really is that crazy and because it's that crazy the only thing you can do to combat that"
"4485610","4495530"," is uh a trade war right like create create war i think about that with elon too i really"
"4495530","4502050"," do i'm like uh i think about that with elon and a lot of his um public persona right now"
"4502050","4511710"," is likely tied to um um influence"
"4511710","4521010"," on creating a trade war with chinese evs uh i don't necessarily believe in somewhat i realize that"
"4521010","4526770"," part of it is like he wants to be loved and liked and people to react and he's still you"
"4526770","4531210"," know like i'm not what they call him like the happy clown or some shit like look at me over"
"4531210","4537710"," here i'm the fucking clown um but i think part of the underlying of it too is uh what in"

"4578240","4585960"," to see man i read you know i started watching last night i was watching late last so i got"

"4600840","4606920"," a lot of the Netflix documentaries a lot of like amazon netflix have cut the balls off of making"
"4606920","4613500"," really truly good documentaries to please everybody but i did watch the first episode of that show"
"4613500","4618940"," if they popped up my feed press play i didn't want to think about anything i just wanted to eat"
"4618940","4626280"," and turn this thing on and they were talking about uh the cold war uh it was it was a"
"4626280","4631660"," really cool take on the cold war because they were discussing uh the impact of the cold war around"
"4631660","4638880"," the world and you know it impacted central south america and uh they were discussing the resurgence"
"4638880","4647720"," of the cold war again and how it like how it impacts the world uh like the tragedy of it"
"4647720","4655500"," americans like to think about like oh nuclear bombs and all that stuff or the berlin wall um or hey"
"4655500","4661820"," i can point towards vietnam or korea but a lot of people don't know that uh the cold war even"
"4661820","4667540"," impacts like south america central america all kinds of other places in the world um with fighting"
"4667540","4675150"," and stuff like that there's really if you if you have a chance at home watch it uh i was"
"4675150","4685690"," like i was like bob that was it was pretty good documentary i'm surprised um yeah"
"4685690","4693890"," they were they were focusing on some of that stuff yeah instead of so right exactly that stuff so"
"4693890","4700550"," so so just so not just that though they were saying in the documentary they were saying uh the some"
"4700550","4707910"," of the impacts of the cold war uh we're not just like missile crisis like if you look at um"
"4707910","4717870"," now what took place in um al Salvador and Honduras and um Ecuador or even Panama um they"
"4717870","4723130"," were talking about uh sawing crowd the cia sawing crack and stuff and uh the streets of la a lot"
"4723130","4729530"," of that stuff is all tied towards the cold war or tied into uh the cold war and so i"
"4729530","4733890"," think they're gonna i haven't most of this so i don't know where it's going but my assumption here"
"4733890","4741150"," is uh that if the cold war is heating back up does any of that begin to happen down the"
"4741150","4747770"," road next decade or so with china and russia so um let me make any statements here anything like or"
"4747770","4758210"," hate it but um anyways maybe watch that documentary if you're at home IWM"
"4758210","4768210"," coming back in to test 205 27 this is the place you want to be watching on IWM meta trying"
"4768210","4772970"," to build some support here to squeeze higher they're right currently though underneath their uh"
"4772970","4781750"," hourly trigger s px just putting around doing nothing uh currently NVDA is still underneath its uh"
"4781750","4788590"," underneath its hourly trigger you want to see i should raise this one up you want to see NVDA above"
"4788590","4798530"," 906 to initiate a trade to the upside to 959 so"
"4798530","4806290"," we'll watch uh IWM right now and uh see what's going on we're gonna uh check back on xbi so"
"4806290","4815170"," far we have rejection on ba google's still looking pretty bullish here q is not doing too much uh"
"4815170","4821510"," meta I think we already talked about that one and I do want to see meta above uh 496 42"
"4821510","4833780"," right there uh"
"4833780","4838900"," you want to again just like the beginning of the show you want to see for you don't want to"
"4838900","4844300"," see that double bottom means nothing well you know that like traditional charting means nothing"
"4844300","4849900"," what does I shouldn't say it doesn't mean anything it does uh but we don't trade that here we want"
"4849900","4855280"," to see the I want to see price above uh the one minute trigger I want to see it retest"

"5130930","5136250"," high yield at 300 and i'm going to go all in at these levels and ironically right that actually is"
"5136250","5142530"," a positive factor because it will restrict exuberance it will restrict sentiment and positioning"
"5142530","5147450"," and that means that the chances are much higher that even with the elections being or allegedly"
"5147450","5152290"," being such a big risk it actually means that the run up to that in particular is actually still"
"5152290","5156390"," pretty good when you look for example at the Fed i personally would have thought that the Fed"

"5563710","5568850"," bipartisan support to make sure that the Chinese government doesn't own a massive media district i "
"5568850","5575370",".e give me money to support your cause it's totally unclear uh do you do buy this line from"

"5580510","5586330"," at its heart is it i.e force force sale so give me money again in its way i mean"
"5586330","5591210"," i know you call me on cmbc to get wonky and technical so here i am bill regulates the app"
"5591210","5597490"," stores right it regulates infrastructure providers it names tiktok only to define what kinds of"
"5597490","5602450"," businesses the app stores and infrastructure providers cannot do business with so the bill doesn't"
"5602450","5607510"," actually directly ban tiktok it just tells apple and other infrastructure providers you can't have"
"5607510","5612870"," tiktok here okay so that means tiktok can sell itself i think there's enough money on the line from"
"5612870","5618630"," both domestic and foreign investors in tiktok to say okay we've got to make sure we protect our"
"5618630","5623470"," capital our investment we've got all these users we're making all this money we should get out of"
"5623470","5628450"," this definition of foreign adversary controlled application and make sure we can still do business"
"5628450","5631910"," with apple and the other providers in the united states that we need so it is not directly a ban"
"5631910","5638610"," that is technically accurate if tiktok is if tiktok remains in chinese control yeah it's going to"
"5638610","5642870"," get banned because all these companies united states are not allowed to do business with it so a"
"5642870","5648270"," very significant roadblock perhaps me like i'm curious because this is all happening while reddit"
"5648270","5653610"," is on its roadshow uh is social media company as well meeting with investors they say that their"
"5653610","5659070"," content moderation is kind of multi-layered and that they uh you know have a lot of self-policing"
"5659070","5663890"," within their various communities as well as some overarching rules that kind of define what's"
"5663890","5670450"," acceptable or not acceptable on their platform obviously reddit is us based largely us owned but do"
"5670450","5676850"," you think there are any implications for for reddit uh as we think about maybe the potential uh add"
"5677470","5682950"," gains that they could get from this but also the increased attention on capital hill in terms of of"
"5682950","5687830"," content on these platforms moderation on these platforms and just the overall risk of regulation"
"5687830","5694390"," that's facing social media right now yeah i think reddit has a market opportunity here as does"
"5694390","5701550"," youtube as does meta right some donald trump famously said i don't want to there's an opportunity"
"5701550","5707530"," to take market share away from tiktok here and tiktok has really dominated the headlines in terms"
"5707530","5711830"," of where users are going especially young users are going the interesting thing about the"
"5711830","5717210"," regulatory piece is that the united states government cannot pass speech regulations against reddit"
"5717210","5721810"," and meta and google because they're us companies they have first amendment rights but it is able to"
"5721810","5728390"," say we've evaluated the algorithms in the speech on tiktok which china owns and said actually we"
"5728390","5732210"," have a very compelling government interest in making sure china doesn't control these algorithms"
"5732210","5736250"," and indoctrinate people into whatever they want or produce whatever disinformation they want"
"5736250","5740750"," especially in election year so there's a very big difference in kind and sort of regulatory"
"5740750","5746570"," protection whether you're a u.s company or a company that domicile outside the united states where"
"5746570","5752070"," our government can't actually regulate or reddit directly on terms of moderation but it feels"
"5752070","5756870"," comfortable saying okay we can regulate a chinese company but speech is one thing and then"
"5756870","5762550"," magnifying certain speeches another right i mean how does the regulation look at that discrepancy"
"5762550","5767550"," if you know you have a whole host of comments on a certain platform but then you know one side"
"5767550","5772570"," is magnified and it could be some kind of foreign infiltration which we've seen in the in the past"
"5772570","5778510"," of trying to sway whether it be an election or kind of a national security issue public perception"
"5778510","5783930"," i mean is are there certain regulations that could change the dynamic for something like that for"
"5783930","5790050"," the algorithm itself there are so many of those ideas floating out there in the world and none of"
"5790050","5797690"," them really have any attraction i've asked lawmakers from barack obama to senators to congress"
"5797690","5802830"," people i've asked CEOs of these companies how do you differentiate between okay we're amplifying a"
"5802830","5807210"," bunch of speech in the speech itself and there are theories but none of them have actually gotten"
"5807210","5811990"," very far there's some sitting in front of the Supreme Court right now that we have no idea how the"
"5811990","5819250"," real difference for a company like reddit is they can tell their investors we are protected by the"
"5819250","5823490"," First Amendment we have a strong moral case to stand in front of the Supreme Court and say the"
"5823490","5827290"," First Amendment protects what happens here because we're a u.s. company with a majority of us users"
"5827290","5833770"," for a tiktok it cannot go to its investors or its users and say we have regulatory certainty"
"5833770","5838610"," because it is in fact owned by china in the United States government feels very comfortable saying"
"5838610","5843630"," okay we're we're going to regulate the speech that is controlled by a foreign country and i think"
"5843630","5849530"," that big difference is going to win the day that's already already won the day in the house i have"
"5849530","5852750"," no idea what's going to happen at the senate but it is also already won the day in the white"
"5852750","5857850"," house and so i'll just come back to what i said at the beginning one way or another tiktok is"
"5857850","5861670"," going to get regulated in this country it seems obvious that that will happen and whether that"
"5861670","5867230"," regulation results in u.s. company buying tiktok as we saw strong tried to do with microsoft as"
"5867230","5871250"," we've seen him try to do with oracle whether it results in a total ban which seems very unlikely"
"5871810","5875850"," something will change and how this company is controlled because the united states government has"
"5875850","5882330"," decided that the chinese government should not control this much speech united states yeah we'll"
"5882330","5887070"," talk next time maybe about how some of the big players may be involved oracle specifically and we"
"5887070","5893950"," always appreciate the wonkiness on the like thank you be like that's what i'm here for yeah so"

"6215400","6221800"," them what else will be doing with Burlington stores another one uh they're down a little bit today"

"6611620","6615960"," Comcast business technology event which is on the sidelines of the of the players championship in"
"6615960","6621360"," Florida and joining me is Alex Karp he is the CEO of Palantir it is great to speak with you"
"6621360","6628020"," very nice to be here happy to be among the players yeah same here so that I want to talk"
"6628020","6634220"," about the stock for a moment it has boomed and you have seen a lot of growth recently driven by"
"6634220","6642740"," commercial accounts corporate customers what's driving that well I mean America you know America is"
"6642740","6649320"," the most meritocratic uh competitive market in the world and so that's obviously a huge advantage"
"6649320","6655600"," for us because our basic claim to fame is uh the soft historically over 20 years the stuff you're"
"6655600","6660420"," installing isn't going to work what we're doing will work it's not we do it we built the software"
"6660420","6663680"," in a way maybe you wouldn't think it should be built but that is the way it should be built"
"6663680","6668980"," whether that's been on the battlefield fighting terrorism our AI product and we go across the"
"6668980","6674700"," country and we say you've installed a lot of things you obviously see the power of AI there's a"
"6674700","6678560"," question of what AI is for some people it's machine learning for some of these algorithms to some"
"6678560","6683540"," extent some people it's how you actually extract value of a large language models we will show you"
"6683540","6689520"," our product working in hours and then you can actually compare it to what you would like to do and"
"6689520","6694640"," in every other culture in the world there's still very much driven by ideology of what should work"
"6694640","6700320"," uh we have deep experience uh managing algorithms and now by extension large language models"
"6700320","6706460"," because of the work that our product has been used to power in the classified space companies are"
"6706460","6712180"," eating it up and companies like it they like the approach i i i think you know one of the"
"6712180","6718200"," most important things that happened in uh in software was large language models convince people"
"6718200","6723580"," that you could get value out of AI that's obvious but they also somehow convince people software is"
"6723580","6729400"," not a luxury product it has to work it's got to move from something that you just paid for to"
"6729400","6733360"," something that improves your margins improves your ability to organize your business makes your"
"6733360","6740140"," business more robust also last not least one of the great dangers of this kind of the world is safe"
"6740140","6745540"," everything's going to work out we're all going to get uh we're all going to get richer and happier"
"6745540","6752320"," and like each other more farce was that the assumptions that your products could be not robust"
"6752320","6759460"," barely work thin at no value that that was a playbook from silicon valley onto the commercial space"
"6759460","6766000"," that playbook is just completely failed and our view of how you build this is you build something"
"6766000","6771780"," that is more valuable for the partner whether it's a classified space or a company employing"
"6771780","6776840"," hundreds of thousand people that will help them so but but companies have a lot of choices now and"
"6776840","6781960"," increasingly more choices there's the googles and the microsoft's and what what is it that you are"
"6781960","6787320"," providing that is different and who do you compete with um well i mean you should ask the clients"
"6787320","6792000"," who are buying it what we're providing like what we're really doing is saying okay everybody claims"
"6792000","6798900"," everyone's making the same claim the claim is you can get a large language model to crease your"
"6798900","6805540"," output at a lower cost so you get more sales more revenue higher margins higher margins okay but"
"6805540","6809840"," we're making the same claim the only thing is we're not making a claim we're saying we will show"
"6809840","6816640"," you while they tell you and those like all these people making all these claims are the only"
"6816640","6821720"," marketing we really have because the most important thing is now we've set a standard the standard"
"6821720","6826040"," is we are going to make the enterprise more efficient we're going to make the enterprise stronger"
"6826040","6831740"," we're going to we're going to we're going to have innovation work in a way that it's differential"
"6831740","6837460"," meaning innovation means nothing if five companies have the same exact margins have the same exact"
"6837460","6843140"," ability to transform are equally robust we're saying pick a part of your business for some people"
"6843140","6847440"," by the way it's not margins it's not even it's like okay they're worried that their supply chain"
"6847440","6851720"," may break tomorrow because they're dependent on a part that comes from a country that's about to be"
"6851720","6857740"," disrupted they're worried that they have to figure out what's likely to break break in their"
"6857740","6862180"," product they don't have enough engineers people have very disparate use cases but the basic use"
"6862180","6868280"," cases my business has to be healthier stronger than it is now and healthy and stronger than the"
"6868280","6871780"," people I compete against yeah I mean what are what are some what are some good if you could"
"6871780","6877440"," specific use cases because you you've called out companies in earnings publicly Airbus for instance"
"6877440","6883100"," we talked to you when the CEO of her hurts the car rental company where's it working best I mean"
"6883100","6887640"," it's working very well in all these companies I mean one use case very very excited about is our"
"6887640","6892820"," work that's now public for Panasonic battery so this is super interesting most batteries that have"
"6892820","6898360"," to be built for EVs are built we're built formerly in Japan how do you bring a company that you"
"6898360","6903920"," know produces things in a exceedingly Japanese robots Japanese workers people who've been working"
"6903920","6908640"," in that environment for 30 years people who know their machine that builds the battery so well that"
"6908640","6913720"," they can literally walk by it and into what's wrong how do you bring that to Nevada and then have"
"6913720","6917960"," people who are high school college trained who are not engineers who have never worked at a battery"
"6917960","6923340"," company that are from a completely different culture than than ours or theirs and ramp it up so"
"6923340","6928040"," that they can go to the machine and figure out where's the machine broken how do I replace parts"
"6928040","6933240"," before they're broken how do I actually understand which part is the problem which part is not the"
"6933240","6940020"," problem every single part has a 10,000 page manual on how you fix it so you basically and what"
"6940020","6944300"," if what if the what if the engineer in Japan is not available so these are use cases you can"
"6944300","6949480"," actually do with large language models and our product the other thing you can do is you can"
"6949480","6955720"," produce a manufacturing environment just like you can in Taiwan and Japan in this country so these"
"6955720","6961800"," these environments are built specifically for Japanese and Taiwanese and other cultures and in the"
"6961800","6965840"," past you just couldn't build an American now you can and then there's a myriad of other ones like"
"6965840","6971120"," how do you task a satellite you're a large agricultural company you have to decide which satellite"
"6971120","6975480"," you deploy over your which satellite you don't and then for more technical people who gets to"
"6975480","6980480"," decide where your production goes who can shut it down who can ramp it up who can these things you"
"6980480","6984360"," just can't walk and do an enterprise with a large language model outsource your knowledge of your"
"6984360","6988980"," enterprise and task the large language model you'd be essentially outsourcing you could have"
"6988980","6993620"," hallucinate your business out of business so when I when I said I was you were coming on I talked"
"6993620","6998140"," to some of the analyst and they all want to talk about these boot camps that you do because"
"6998140","7004860"," apparently this is just like super fast right training on AI and on your platforms and they want to"
"7004860","7010300"," know how quickly you are transforming corporate companies into accounts off of these boot camps I"
"7010300","7016220"," think you've done more than 800 yeah so but the relevant just so just you know a couple years ago"
"7016220","7021340"," we were doing like 70 80 90 pilots a year and now in the next year we're going to do"
"7021340","7027660"," you know 20 times that boot camps and what's what's the strategic advantage of them well everyone's"
"7027660","7033340"," claiming to do things and we're showing them being done so it's like you know like look we could we"
"7033340","7037960"," could hire marketing we've never been good at marketing we could run around say there are 50 things"
"7037960","7042220"," we do better there are certain also technical things that we've built that people don't understand"
"7042220","7052000"," their value yet so it's better just to show the value of an ability to do handoffs inside"
"7052000","7057160"," your enterprise dis disambiguate right from read functions in the context of using that you can"
"7057160","7060920"," have long conversations or you can show it so that's the central advantage and by the way the other"
"7060920","7066140"," advantage is just like we've done across US government we want to set a standard and then everyone"
"7066140","7073960"," can be measured by that standard great it's meritocracy out there be you xyzcompanyai.com great"
"7073960","7079480"," well why aren't you doing boot camps you know it's like we have like decades of a product"
"7079480","7084140"," experience in our products that are valuable for this use case and then on the conversion thing"
"7084140","7089860"," look you know i'm it's like what we are seeing people adopt recalibrate their standard and quite"
"7089860","7095100"," frankly well as you saw if you've seen this morning people are recommending our product one to"
"7095100","7100680"," another one of the other things that's very special about the u.s. opposed to like american ci o ci"
"7100680","7106000"," o's and others they call their buddies they're like hey you're driving while it's here i'm driving"
"7106000","7111320"," pound here maybe you ought to get on the pound your train so you know that it's like we're it's"
"7111320","7115660"," like for just it's kind of an obvious thing if you there's no point in saying our product is the"
"7115660","7119760"," best one we can show it to be the best got it what you're also i mean use cases on"
"7119760","7124540"," the battlefield as well obviously the government is a huge customer you recently secured the titan"
"7124540","7130400"," contract which was a big deal because it was for building a vehicle right using the software to"
"7130400","7135800"," build a vehicle what what what is it allowing you to do how is it changing modern warfare the most"
"7135800","7143020"," important thing our country can do is in the in the defense context is just absorb the profound"
"7143020","7147480"," banality that america's better at software than any other country in the world and especially than"
"7147480","7152180"," our adversaries how much better are we well they're i know of no like in a like we need i"
"7152180","7157260"," know of no enterprise software company outside of america that is would even conceive ever consider"
"7157260","7161760"," doing a boot camp like maybe you can argue that others just copy us and you can compare ours"
"7161760","7165840"," there's no company is even going to respond to that so it's like there are no large enterprise"
"7165840","7170740"," companies that i'm aware of in software in china there are basically the companies in europe that"
"7170740","7176040"," exist are older they're not charismatic in this country so there's there's this basically you know"
"7176040","7180560"," one of the things that's interesting about our our our country is we're so good at certain things"
"7180560","7184200"," we underestimate how much better we are than others because it just seems normal but the tech"
"7184200","7191180"," industry the tech ecosystem of term i hate is unique from venture to production also we build"
"7191180","7195900"," companies that have a new playbook there is no playbook for Palantir so it's like so then you're"
"7195900","7200140"," ready for the world as it exists not as the world as it exists to 20 years ago so what"
"7200140","7207020"," is the conceptually and tactical most important thing about Titan is we became a software prime if"
"7207020","7212040"," we are going to scare our adversaries not kind of make them wonder if they should attack us move"
"7212040","7217000"," make them terrified to consider attacking us we have to play on our terms just like an obvious"
"7217000","7223400"," thing about winning is you don't allow the of adversary to define the terms of battle the terms of"
"7223400","7228220"," battle that the adversaries like our hardware because they have like very technical hardware"
"7228220","7233500"," cultures they don't have software culture so the more we can do software empowered weapon systems"
"7233500","7238680"," the more it becomes our game by the way and they're just a lot of cascading advantages because one"
"7238680","7242240"," of the issues we have to resolve in this country is well how do you do enough manufacturing to"
"7242240","7246880"," supply the hardware side that's also a software problem how do you bring a manufacturing culture"
"7246880","7252300"," back to american so that you can actually produce the armaments well you can be like a second rate"
"7252300","7258100"," hardware culture or you can be a first rate software driven hardware culture and that that was the"
"7258100","7262820"," aspiration and that's why internally we have always that thing like the external incitement"
"7262820","7269720"," internal excited we at Palantir very excited about the titan with first of all we won which is like"
"7269720","7274800"," you know and you know now we're like we are a large company we're profitable investors are excited"
"7274800","7279320"," about it investors are excited about it but you know burning the short sellers i love burning the"
"7279320","7286480"," short sellers like almost nothing makes a human happier than taking the lines of cocaine and away"
"7286480","7292360"," from these short sellers who like are going short on a truly great american company not just ours"
"7292360","7297100"," but it just love pulling down great american companies so that they can pay for their coke and the"
"7297100","7302520"," best thing that could happen to them is we will provide we will leave their coke dealers to their"
"7302520","7308400"," homes after they can't pay their bills and that that's like one of my surely all short sellers yeah"
"7308400","7314520"," well you know go ahead do your thing we'll do our thing so as it relates to the battlefield you"
"7314520","7319940"," know you're you're talking about america's edge you've also been um supplying our allies Ukraine"
"7319940","7327240"," and israel in in two wars that it's hard to tell how they end when do you do you have"
"7327240","7332340"," any insight on that based on on your visits to both and on the work that you're doing well i"
"7332340","7336800"," mean they're very very different places with different cultures and different strengths and"
"7336800","7341680"," weaknesses on the Ukraine side it's they they need america's help and you know the funding that"
"7341680","7345640"," would be in a very difficult position if the funding doesn't go through so that's that like what"
"7345640","7351200"," what they've shown is that you can massively outperform what you should be able to perform using"
"7351200","7357260"," software and that the that that having people with software platforms that actually work on top of"
"7357260","7362700"," which they built is ideally suited for the modern battle situation in israel there's a lot of our"
"7362700","7366980"," products are used are publicly disclosed in one place and not public schools and other and the more"
"7366980","7373720"," that the issue there is much more you know why do most most people in the world and most people"
"7373720","7379960"," who are successful support israel so why is it that so few of us admit that we support israel that"
"7379960","7384340"," that's the central issue israel has it does not it's like it has a lot of complex are very"
"7384340","7387980"," complicated environment in the middle east an environment that it's hard for americans to"
"7387980","7392460"," understand there are a lot of difficult choices that are none of them are perfect in israel they"
"7392460","7398880"," are they are obviously an ally and we obviously stand by them and i would say from perspective of"
"7398880","7404160"," palantir it's like israel is known as the second best tech community in the world and when they"
"7404160","7408620"," have a choice of what software to buy they buy the best software in the world and it's noticeable"
"7408620","7414120"," that there you have been i mean i haven't seen any ceo as that spoken on on the topic and"
"7414120","7420880"," in public in public you took out the new york times full page ad supporting israel i part of it"
"7420880","7426220"," part for some people will say well it's because you sell you know that's your business well we were"
"7426220","7432500"," we like we were israel we do israel is historically bought a product it's it's not a commercially"
"7432500","7438880"," relevant part of our business is there's there's and and you could you with the reason why a lot of"
"7438880","7443240"," people don't speak up publicly is we have a lot of other markets that are much bigger where maybe"
"7443240","7448340"," speaking of as controversial like the us and other markets and you know so this is definitively was"
"7448340","7454300"," not an economic decision of any you could critique it as an economic decision i believe that you"
"7454300","7459320"," know like first of all we have a precedent in this culture where people are supposed to speak up it"
"7459320","7463680"," seems like they only speak up when the issue is either irrelevant meaningless or somehow it's"
"7463680","7467300"," something you can say that you don't believe that won't get you in trouble and will allow you to"
"7467300","7471600"," sell products you may not believe in while pretending you have beliefs you don't that's not how we"
"7471600","7475880"," roll a pound here and we we when you come to pound here to work a pound here when you"
"7475880","7480860"," invest in pound here or when you use our products have you lost employees because of the we've lost"
"7480860","7486800"," employees i'm sure we'll lose employees i'm sure we'll lose you know it's like any real you could"
"7486800","7490800"," if you have a position that does not and cost you ever to lose an employee it's not a position"
"7490800","7496320"," it's some kind of self-pleasuring where the joke is on the other person or the joke is on you"
"7496320","7502800"," and we don't when you join pound here and you dedicate your life to pound here we are promise i"
"7502800","7506360"," am standing in front of the company that people run count here saying they're coming not promising"
"7506360","7510920"," you to tell you something you want to hear we're gonna get as close to telling you how we see"
"7510920","7516940"," the world as we're legally and ethically allowed to and we also do this externally so when you buy"
"7516940","7522220"," pound here when i'm telling you that i'm going to sit behind the product or i'm going to sit behind"
"7522220","7526720"," a deployment i'm telling you what i believe that you know they're obviously business works"
"7526720","7531900"," complicated you have to make choices but and then there's no this is not a small issue from my"
"7531900","7541900"," perspective it's not about just about israel it's like do you believe in the west and by"
"7541900","7545900"," the way the other thing it's about is you know a lot of people believe these things in private but"
"7545900","7550040"," they think they have the luxury of not defending them in public it's just not true you know part of"
"7550040","7556160"," the reason we have all this like scourge of a kind of not to seek a frantic soft thin"
"7556160","7561800"," counterproductive suicidal fog that is infected a lot of our large institutions is because the"
"7561800","7566160"," people who are doing important things who do not agree they never speak up if you don't speak up"
"7566160","7570480"," and the other side is the only plus side screaming don't be surprised when a lot of people follow"
"7570480","7575500"," it and so it is imperative on people to actually stand up and yes there will be costs but the"
"7575500","7580960"," costs are much greater if you don't well it's surprisingly unique to hear alex um and a message i"

"8293900","8299340"," showing you the year to date returns from both of these stocks which in a sense tell the story of"
"8299340","8304639"," this market at large stocks that have had momentum like in Vidya doing incredibly well stocks that"
"8304639","8313799"," have lost theirs like tesla not so much the question is are we really seeing a trend change yes or"
"8313799","8322040"," no a trend change as it relates to momentum being the positive factor unequivocally no we are not"
"8322040","8327379"," we are not so far why do you say it's so better how you are so far year to date"
"8327379","8334760"," trend following non discretionary funds and you could go ask AQR you could go ask Mulvaney capital"
"8334760","8342160"," you could go ask Dunn capital they're having their strongest start to the year since 2008 momentum"
"8342160","8348059"," is a factor is back it is leading the market higher if you do not have momentum you will be"
"8348059","8354940"," punished as is the case with Tesla if you have momentum in the case of in Vidya in Vidya right"
"8354940","8361760"," now by the way is is literally the market where in Vidya goes the market is going to go and"
"8361760","8367400"," in Vidya in the last several days has had this handoff from fundamentals to technicals I talked a"
"8367400","8375639"," little bit about this on Monday Monday NVIDIA got down to 841 last week's low 834 you've got a gap"
"8375639","8382080"," down to 823 guess what it holds there momentum restarts NVIDIA bounces market bounces here we are"
"8382080","8388140"," on Wednesday NVIDIA a little bit weak wobbling somewhat market down so it's all about in Vidya"
"8388140","8394860"," right now it is all about the momentum factor it's back it's leading in terms of all other"
"8394860","8403440"," strategies but if NVIDIA stops going up in the way that it was going up before that will then have"
"8403440","8408880"," an impact overall on the factor of momentum you're saying it's the whole market it's the whole"
"8408880","8415320"," market but then how can you say unequivocally know that momentum isn't because it's a near term"
"8415320","8420260"," it's a near term phenomenon and it's not going to break the trend it's not going to break the"
"8420260","8425560"," positive trend of momentum could it lead to a correction within the market absolutely and it"
"8425560","8431460"," rightfully show it rightfully should and the rest of the semis are following along with it look at"
"8431460","8437240"," lamb research look at ALA corporal the semis are following along but the larger context we have a"
"8437240","8442220"," well-defined bullish trend okay so chan Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey says momentum trend is not"
"8442220","8448520"," broken the near term Mo reversal may have room to run he says however macro factors do not suggest"
"8448520","8454520"," an inflection point is likely city says well we find that investors are crowding into a segment of"
"8454520","8459700"," the market rather than call it bubbly we think concentration risks are the concern how do you"
"8459700","8464120"," address that well concentration risk have been the concern for how long now Scott so I don't think"
"8464120","8468940"," that that's anything new I think that we're in this really you know when we look at the quarter at"
"8468940","8474760"," large like quarter over quarter where we are from a timing perspective we're in a period where we"
"8474760","8479260"," don't have a lot of micro data we don't work we're outside of earning season we're not getting that"
"8479260","8486760"," corroboration or or lack of corroboration from the macro with for the macro and so in those periods"
"8486760","8492740"," where if you're looking at certain factors being able to persist or or sustain that's when you"
"8492740","8497280"," start to see maybe a pronounced a more pronounced effect on the market because you're not getting"
"8497280","8503420"," those idiosyncratic forces that may pretend you know potentially upset a trend the other thing is"
"8503420","8508180"," that we're not seeing anything fundamentally from an economic perspective that indicates that"
"8508180","8513360"," trends are changing we're not seeing that move from expansion to contraction or the or vice versa"
"8513360","8518440"," so unless there's a catalyst for there to be a change in the factors that are driving the market"
"8518440","8522820"," which I don't see over the course of the next few weeks that's not likely to upset what we're"
"8522820","8528400"," seeing today and I don't think that investors if they've been in these stocks that have been"
"8528400","8533700"," benefiting from momentum a lot of overlap of those stocks is also with quality so if you're in"
"8533700","8540100"," those two factors what necessarily puts that at odds with where we see the economic picture setting"
"8540100","8544800"," up where we see the Fed setting up those types of factors sounds like Shan is saying just stick"
"8544800","8551760"," stick with what's been working quality and momentum that's the kind of market it's been don't don't"
"8551760","8558260"," take your eye don't get distracted by these you know one or three or four-day moves in Nvidia keep"
"8558260","8562740"," your eye on the ball the ball still says quality momentum are going to lead this market higher"
"8562740","8567960"," that's that's what I hear Shan saying well I I think they both agreed and I would say in the"
"8567960","8574880"," near term that's true but the people who bought Tesla last May and last June thought that they were"
"8574880","8581680"," buying momentum and a trend that would persist more than six weeks but it's stopped in July so you"
"8581680","8588140"," don't know when it's going to stop and momentum is something that refers to the present and refers"
"8588140","8594560"," to what has been recently in the past you can't predict the future so here's something that I"
"8594560","8601800"," believe is important to look at it isn't predictive but important we went back 20 years and we have"
"8601800","8609080"," looked at all the stocks over 20 billion in market cap that were up more than 200 percent 200"
"8609080","8617120"," percent in a 12-month period to see whether they persisted with their alley and it turns out that"
"8617120","8622760"," the majority don't the majority underperform the market in the following 12 months now there's also"
"8622760","8627240"," two things you could point to say oh it's a little flawed because you started at the wrong month or"
"8627240","8632900"," it's a little flawed because you didn't do five billion market cap but the truth is it's not a"
"8632900","8638940"," given that these names that Nvidia is going to go up for the next you know three years or four"
"8638940","8643480"," years so we have to be careful and and being a portfolio manager you have to think about what has"
"8643480","8648820"," worked and where your position might be getting too big and you have to adjust to that and what"
"8648820","8652560"," your time horizon is that you made a really good point this is we're talking about the next several"
"8652560","8657240"," weeks I think before the next earnings season and I can agree with that a longer term you know from"
"8657240","8661440"," from a longer term investment perspective I think these other factors really need to be taking"
"8661440","8668820"," account Joe's feeling good because I'm just sitting here listening because it's a Joe T kind of"
"8668820","8676400"," market okay remember his strategy is quality and momentum the quality ETF the QUAL I thought Pazani"
"8676400","8683960"," did this earlier and it was really telling in his reports the quality ETF is up 11 percent year to"
"8683960","8692400"," date all time high on Friday the MTUM ETF 52 week high on Fridays up near 19 percent year to"
"8692400","8697600"," date the Joe T which melds them both quality and momentum all right here I go back with you here"
"8697600","8701880"," for a minute here give me one quick second I want to talk to you guys about something that's"
"8701880","8710480"," important or near we need this right here do we think that's going to continue that's mute the uh"
"8710480","8721530"," talking heads this over there okay"
"8721530","8732510"," so what I do want to say to you is this I'm looking at the I'm"
"8732510","8741810"," looking at 5 18 C's they're 17 cents right now they've been bounced around like 18 19 17 cents and"
"8741810","8747650"," what I don't like about them is how cheap they are right it shouldn't be that cheap they're one"
"8747650","8754110"," strike from being in the money or two strikes depending on how you count but they're really cheap"
"8754110","8761790"," for being so close to being in the money right there's a lot of interest in those calls you would"
"8761790","8769230"," see more premium if dealers thought we were going there it'd be more premium and there isn't so"
"8769230","8775770"," this whole thing right here I'm like well maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's assigned to whatever"
"8775770","8781250"," does happen here it's not going to get to 5 18 so it's going to roll down but what's really"
"8781250","8790210"," more concerning than that is we have an auction coming up so let's take a look at the economic"
"8790210","8800170"," calendar creating economics hold on here and"
"8800170","8809750"," we're on Wednesday the 13th right at 1 p.m we've got a 30-year bond auction the previous was"
"8809750","8817990"," 4.360 4.360 so we want to see what that is so my guess here is I want you"
"8817990","8824550"," to see if you can watch this right here everything go over to the trigger full screen so just right"
"8824550","8831710"," over here right notice how they're putting us out here and this is very similar to yesterday that"
"8831710","8836630"," one one p.m. auction right we've got another vol in the market right now you can see the pen"
"8836630","8842690"," is still in place right we're still pinning here now so we got a magnet tell me I'm a magnet"
"8842690","8848150"," to the upside we got this like big old magnet up here it's even higher it's much higher but just"
"8848150","8855250"," for figurative purposes you got a magnet up here holding us up right"
"8855250","8863710"," and it's drawing price to that magnet it's actually much higher but there's a magnet there into the"
"8863710","8871490"," into Friday now we do have gamma that does does come off into Friday as well but there's a magnet"
"8871490","8877850"," there it gets weaker as the week moves on but still point being is whenever we have a major"
"8877850","8885930"," pullback it still magnets us back up to that gamma right so we go down and this is what you"
"8885930","8890330"," want to be buying right you don't want to be buying this does that make sense you don't want to"
"8890330","8896490"," buy this you want to buy anything that goes down for the magnet pull back up you'll notice that"
"8896490","8901470"," right now anytime we go down that it pulls us back up it's not like we go down and then"
"8901470","8907210"," we start cascading to the downside make sense so anytime you get an outsized downsides move we're"
"8907210","8914490"," gonna be pulled back higher okay so buying this right here right now I'm like looking at it right"
"8914490","8918310"," now the dealers aren't on it now that doesn't mean we can't go up right here we can't get a"
"8918310","8927650"," good bond or a 30 year bond auction uh and and just start blasting but um there is a setup"
"8927650","8935730"," here right so if you're a bull you would want to hope for a for a bad auction you want"
"8935730","8943650"," a D we were saying yesterday to follow uh Andy constant right damp spring on twitter uh you're"
"8943650","8950390"," fascinatingly enough yesterday too Andy had made a post yesterday later in the day saying I was"
"8950390","8958290"," wrong on the market uh he should have made a better statement uh because yesterday there was an"
"8958290","8965730"," auction right a treasury auction yesterday he gave it a D and we had the same setup right and what"
"8965730","8970410"," happened when we got that D grade from Andy remember you're like hey cap what do you give the"
"8970410","8979530"," auction I was like I see maybe a D and I was happened when that D came out from Andy"
"8979530","8988930"," constant was uh this setup that was here we bludded we bludded straight down remember that uh"
"8988930","8994630"," we got down to the half an hour trigger bounced up and we didn't continue down to the hourly"
"8994630","9002310"," trigger but we did at least make that move down and you know you you guys out there not you"
"9002310","9006930"," guys but some people out there like well Andy doesn't ever get anything right and my take on that"
"9006930","9009910"," is I don't care if he gets it right or wrong and I don't follow him to get it right"
"9009910","9015390"," or wrong but at the same time he made a call yesterday uh about that fucking bond auction and we"
"9015390","9021190"," went straight down moments later uh moments later so I got to give that to Andy I wanted to say"
"9021190","9027070"," that publicly to him too like that dude you fucking called it perfectly for me yesterday uh so that"
"9027070","9031510"," setup is back in place again right now do you see it was parked right here right it's now 12"
"9031510","9038090"," 13 we have 45 minutes left and uh we were not set up perfectly for it but this is the"
"9038090","9044990"," same fucking setup as yesterday right this looks the exact same thing as yesterday uh so now we are"
"9044990","9051010"," lined up for that there's likely a hedge on the market right here right now is probably a big hedge"
"9051010","9056770"," right here right now getting primed up for this auction at 1 p.m if the grade is a D"
"9056770","9060930"," you would expect us to actually go down bloodbath at down here hopefully I'd like to see that right"
"9060930","9065730"," there close the gap not the gap of the squeeze from yesterday and this would be the buy right here"
"9065730","9071390"," uh so now can we go up here sure there is two trades here you could take like that trade"
"9071390","9079510"," you can take the um the 5 18 c zero day trades super cheap if you get smoked out in"
"9079510","9085430"," that trade let's say the the auction is horrible right let's just say the hedge is on and start"
"9085430","9091230"," grinding down maybe you could put that trade on here like you bought you look for the 5 18 c's"
"9091230","9096950"," if we do any more of this bullshit you've got three chances right 1 2 and 3 so if you"
"9096950","9102290"," get another chance down here put on some 4 18 or 5 18's for the bond auction to go up"
"9102290","9105970"," and if they're 7 cents or 10 cents or whatever the fuck they are you're gonna make"
"9105970","9115770"," a 40 cents or 20 cents or 30"
"9115770","9122190"," cents right you can come right back down here if it bloods and I would then take a closer in"
"9122190","9129290"," the money trade take a 5 14 c that's worthless for the squeeze up so there's like two two great"
"9129290","9135290"," opportunities here to make some money at least some kind of money uh into that 1 p.m. hour um"
"9135290","9141310"," and what's the what's the price of the trade price of the trade right now is or it was a"
"9141310","9147190"," moment to go 16 cents pretty fucking cheap um I wouldn't keep adding to that strike either I'd just"
"9147190","9151470"," throw the trade on I don't mean right now at this moment this is not financial advice but there is"
"9151470","9157410"," a trade here there's a trade for the upside move if you get blown out of that trade and it"
"9157410","9163110"," starts to roll down right you start to get below this level right here you probably salvage a few"
"9163110","9168450"," pennies off of any kind of breakdown here so you cut the trade loose right and then you look for"
"9168450","9174010"," that bounce to actually get back in on some other cheap fucking calls for like 10 cents trades now"
"9174010","9179550"," costing you probably total if you manage it right like 20 cents and all you need to get off that"
"9179550","9183610"," trade is what another 20 cents or something if you blast up here you're gonna make tons of money"
"9183610","9191730"," now there is some risk here uh with this with this thought process we do have uh volatility"
"9191730","9198850"," tomorrow in the morning so there could be a no bounce where we just roll down into the um expected"
"9198850","9205690"," news for thursday right in the morning get a quick squeeze up more bullshit down here in friday um"
"9205690","9213410"," economic news but then friday we just squeeze straight up into that pin at 520 so there is some"
"9213410","9219270"," opportunity here is my point uh to either do those those zero dates every time we get down here or"
"9219270","9227070"," even just looking for a nice fucking fat low to get something in the money for a friday close uh"
"9227070","9233810"," maybe not get 520s but you know it could be 514 with a friday expiry or a monday expiry um"
"9233810","9239530"," for that upside move right now basically they're gonna grind all this shit uh and there it's like"
"9239530","9245530"," it's like a game until friday so there's an opportunity here on the indexes though i still think"
"9245530","9251270"," single tickers are the best bet for you um impossibly IWM into the weekend uh because that seems"
"9251270","9258170"," like the most the most wound up of the three indexes uh but anyway anyway uh a lot of sitting"
"9258170","9262850"," around right the indexes aren't doing shit we're grinding sideways right now they're just torching"
"9262850","9268810"," torching torching who do you think's doing this torching right now what do you think this is it's"
"9268810","9274410"," fucking dealers they don't want to pay you they don't want to pay anybody um the more people that"
"9274410","9279550"," don't get paid into the expiry in front of the happier they are they're paying legs on flies and"
"9279550","9283770"," stuff like that they're not paying 10 dollars in those fucking things they're paying like 15 cents"
"9283770","9289390"," a dollar dollar 50 50 cents these guys are out there buying these flies for like you know three"

"12927660","12928400"," Did we?"
"12928600","12930400"," We got the initial move down."
"12930620","12933900"," We came back up and tested the five minute and didn't get it. "
"12934220","12940200"," So let's find out if we get the second trend, the second, the second target on this move higher."
"12940220","12941120"," We got the first one."
"12941380","12942780"," Do we get the second one?"
"12942940","12949580"," Big question here if we get that or not to the downside yesterday, we did not get the second leg"
"12949580","12950220"," down. "
"12950440","12954440"," They brought us back to the five minute trigger upside down and then when they reverse it went the"
"12954440","12954820"," other way."
"12955180","12960980"," So be careful of that right now on the on the on the spy specifically."
"12966990","12969010"," Spy is a little or apple sick. "
"12969190","12969750"," I don't think so."
"12970570","12971550"," I don't think so."
"12971690","12971930"," Sorry. "
"12972450","12972930"," Sorry."
"12973170","12974190"," I just agree with the other person."
"12974710","12976790"," No, no, no harm intended either. "
"12977350","12981130"," Whenever I hear bad or sick or ugly or I'm like, that's time to buy."
"12981610","12983290"," Whenever something's like, yeah, it's really good."
"12983330","12983670"," It looks great. "
"12983950","12984710"," I'm not a buyer there."
"12985210","12989130"," Always a buyer on sickly and ugly and sad and all that kind of stuff."
"12989770","12991090"," Never a buyer on a string. "
"12991290","12992270"," Always a buyer on weakness."
"12993710","12994330"," Complete opposite."
"12994710","12995790"," I'm a complete opposite trader. "
"12996790","12997730"," That's for me personally."
"12998890","13002870"," I like to see like that turn on that like I'm looking for a turn then an apple to buy."
"13003970","13006430"," Well, oftentimes if people come here and they're like, hey, what about that ticker?"
"13006490","13007550"," I'm like, nah, it's already up there. "
"13007630","13008250"," I don't want anything to do with it."
"13008250","13011990"," Trying to find the stock that's going down has made the turn."
"13012410","13014510"," It's in the trough and it's starting to turn up. "
"13015390","13018190"," Always say something or I guess I should would say this."
"13018590","13020030"," The tickers that I like are like this."
"13020370","13026890"," Blood starting to flatten out and starting to make a turn up. "
"13027790","13029890"," This is what I want you to tell me about right here."
"13030990","13031250"," Right?"
"13031450","13031890"," It's for a buy."
"13032550","13033010"," For a sell. "
"13033830","13034390"," For a sell."
"13035650","13037590"," I'm always looking for you to tell me something like this."
"13040730","13042750"," Stocks going up, right?"
"13043730","13044710"," And begins to cross. "
"13046610","13048890"," Tell me about that stock that it's looking sickly."
"13049250","13050770"," Is apple looking like that right now?"
"13051750","13054230"," So if apple's looking sickly, it should look like this."
"13056950","13057990"," I'm not seeing that. "
"13058190","13060050"," I think that already happened right a couple weeks ago."
"13060550","13061690"," Like a week, not a week, a couple weeks ago."
"13062290","13063930"," Yeah, like a week and a half ago or something like that. "
"13065110","13072230"," I really want to see like the turn or I want to see that's for bears and then the bulls"
"13072230","13075830"," I want to see sideways and starting to turn up."
"13077430","13079110"," Either of these and I'll take it."
"13079670","13080310"," Either of these. "
"13082030","13083170"," I want one or the other."
"13083530","13084250"," Do more research."
"13084530","13085190"," Give me another ticker. "
"13085790","13088250"," Give me a ticker that's just rolling over right now."
"13093610","13094990"," So apple's in the triple bottom."
"13096530","13097230"," Yeah, I'm not. "
"13097270","13098810"," I'm not bearish on apple here at all."
"13100350","13104250"," Or like if you it was rolling over, I'd be like, fuck yeah, let's look at it."
"13106150","13106530"," Definitely. "
"13107010","13109210"," Like if you're like bearish on a ticker, it should be the beginning."
"13109550","13111830"," If you're bullish on a ticker, it should be at the turn."
"13113270","13116730"," And then bring that up and find whatever you can find. "
"13116910","13118330"," Find whatever you want and I'll look at it."
"13118550","13122270"," So if you got one of those tickers that's rolling over, let me know."
"13122550","13125570"," If you got a ticker that's flattening out and coming up, let me know so we can do an actual"
"13125570","13126270"," trade on it. "
"13130870","13131610"," Triggers and velocity."
"13132630","13133790"," We got triggers velocity."
"13134490","13137310"," I've got some supply bars up here. "
"13138070","13144650"," And then we also normally put up a pin at points, either traditional or or I'll show it to you"
"13144650","13145570"," right there."
"13146790","13147710"," Let's see where they are."
"13151890","13152950"," There's one right there. "
"13156540","13157120"," There's one."
"13157300","13157600"," There's two."
"13158080","13158520"," There's S one. "
"13159380","13161020"," There's the pivot point right there."
"13162320","13163920"," We have our TX buys and sells."
"13167710","13169770"," And then we get a bunch of gammon crap down below. "
"13170090","13172110"," So if you're new here, we've got a gammon down below."
"13172770","13176670"," You see gammon SPX, then we've got a pivot points and we've got triggers and velocity."
"13182800","13184520"," Okay, so we have more information now. "
"13184540","13189260"," Looks like Andy Konstan posted something about the bond reform earlier."
"13189460","13192040"," SLR, whatever that is, check it out if interested."
"13193720","13197240"," Is that part of a basil or no?"
"13200100","13201740"," Congratulations on your PayPal calls. "
"13214150","13216750"," Yeah, try to find tickers that are like just rolling over."
"13216870","13222210"," Try to find tickers that are just going to give you the reason for this too."
"13223130","13229570"," The reason I'm saying that about it looks sick or something is because if we can get a ticker that"
"13229570","13235990"," jumps underneath, it's daily trigger with price in the hourly trigger, we'll short the fuck out of"
"13235990","13236110"," it. "
"13236370","13238450"," So if you ever find one of those, let me know."
"13239010","13240810"," Not after the move is made though."
"13244090","13245030"," Do I like what?"
"13245030","13249250"," I can't read everything you guys are saying. "
"13249250","13249590"," Hold on."
"13251090","13252190"," We already went over snow."
"13252390","13252850"," I made my thoughts. "
"13253050","13253490"," No, I trade."
"13253810","13255870"," I charted the whole entire thing up."
"13257230","13258050"," I already did it. "
"13258210","13258990"," I already did snow."
"13260850","13262090"," Do I like who?"
"13263470","13264750"," Oh, and I'm here for a long term."
"13266470","13267090"," Hold on. "
"13267390","13267470"," X."
"13268430","13274410"," You want me to look at those?"
"13274410","13275950"," I haven't I'm blind guys."
"13276190","13276970"," Like I need to do glasses."
"13277430","13278930"," I'm like at a point where I need fucking glasses. "
"13280790","13281770"," I'm fucking blind."
"13282770","13283990"," I'm ready to make the jump."
"13284750","13286870"," I got to go to 1.75s, I think. "
"13292210","13292930"," Hold on."
"13292990","13293790"," Let me write some of these down."
"13294670","13295010"," Hold on. "
"13295150","13297850"," I can't do them all, but hold on here."
"13301800","13302880"," We got 3M."
"13303940","13304820"," We get X."
"13306180","13307320"," And crowd strike. "
"13307860","13312260"," I don't think I've done either of any of those in a while."
"13313380","13314680"," Sorry to keep bringing this up."
"13314840","13315880"," So, uh, no, no, it's too much. "
"13315940","13316140"," Sorry."
"13316240","13317520"," All right, grubster PD."
"13317800","13318140"," That's it. "
"13318380","13319180"," That's all I want."
"13321060","13322540"," I can't spend the whole day doing this."
"13325420","13329980"," How about I'll look at all four right now in the background. "
"13330480","13333020"," And if anything strikes my interest, I'll show the chart."
"13334600","13336160"," Grubster, you're like OG, brother."
"13336620","13337160"," I got you, man. "
"13337940","13339060"," You're an old fucking G, man."
"13339140","13339700"," I got you covered."
"13342940","13343640"," Pull that. "
"13343640","13344980"," Pull that OG shit on me."
"13346900","13353760"," Sorry, I'm just fucking with all target for IWM."
"13355720","13357280"," You want to ask the community. "
"13357920","13360160"," They got my targets last night in the market brief."
"13361020","13363260"," Those are those are four members."
"13364200","13366480"," I love you too, grubster. "
"13367660","13369020"," Oh, yeah, there you go."
"13372020","13373280"," This has to be a little bit lower."
"13373320","13373940"," It's like right there. "
"13374740","13376020"," Why is this up here?"
"13376860","13378080"," Uh, so here, ready?"
"13378760","13381540"," So, do I think it's going here?"
"13381740","13381880"," Okay."
"13381960","13382780"," Do I think it's going here?"
"13382880","13383180"," Is the question?"
"13384040","13392000"," Um, no, I put the arrow there because I want to see if price goes there."
"13392860","13394380"," It gives me an idea. "
"13399100","13405280"," If we fail, if we fail this target, right?"
"13405660","13409940"," It shows that bulls are kind of weak and that sellers are strong."
"13413020","13421320"," If we do go there, shows that a short"
"13421320","13424520"," is weaker than the buyer."
"13425040","13425380"," Make sense?"
"13425860","13431960"," So, this is here for, this is here from my, I want to know if we go here or there. "
"13432540","13447170"," So, I'm up there looking to see"
"13447170","13449450"," how changed the lights in here."
"13449790","13451110"," We did a whole bear thing yesterday."
"13453510","13454110"," Hold on. "
"13454770","13459930"," We did a, we did a huge bear thing here yesterday and I turned everything red and I never turned"
"13459930","13460330"," it back."
"13463130","13464290"," We're going to go back to blue."
"13466050","13466770"," There we go. "
"13466770","13467710"," Nice and much better."
"13468110","13468470"," There we go."
"13468490","13469210"," Back to blue again. "
"13471930","13473670"," We got green on the other one."
"13473870","13480170"," So, you know, coin."
"13486070","13488150"," Now, do you want to do an advertisement right now?"
"13488450","13492630"," If you don't know what I'm talking about, when I say the market brief, we are a free community. "
"13493110","13494590"," What we do here is free."
"13496170","13499290"," Now, what we tried to do is make it a more sustainable community."
"13499890","13506730"," If you want to become a part of that more sustainable We have an entry-level membership of $32,"
"13507430","13508270"," it's dirt cheap. "
"13508830","13511710"," You get a ton of shit for it, Paul ton of shit."
"13512810","13516130"," It's as free as it can be, and you get to chat and Twitch."
"13516870","13522830"," So if you're paying every month to chat on Twitch, you might as well just get that membership. "
"13523070","13524190"," It's wrapped into that membership."
"13525230","13526290"," It makes it even less expensive."
"13526610","13530350"," It's like $15 a month or something like that, $17 a month, something like that. "
"13530350","13533250"," So it's a no-brainer for you to not become a supporter."
"13533950","13537910"," And I'll tell you what, we've done this for free for three years."
"13538650","13541050"," It's cost me shit tons of money in time. "
"13541490","13546130"," It's cost the admins, the moderators a ton of time."
"13547450","13552030"," We had volunteer developers that cost them a ton of time."
"13553090","13555770"," So if you, everyone here has been on volunteer. "
"13555770","13560390"," So if you are a supporter, if you are a pro trader, I really appreciate it."
"13560490","13566010"," Because what you're saying to us is, you want us to continue this community, but you want to see"
"13566010","13566850"," this community grow."
"13566870","13568310"," You want to seek further development. "
"13568890","13570570"," You want to see where we go."
"13570570","13572390"," So I want you to know that I appreciate it."
"13572590","13577010"," And I thank you for making this jump with us to see if it can be successful. "
"13577690","13582310"," If we can't make this jump, we are going to stop doing what we're doing."
"13582530","13584370"," So I want to thank you right now."
"13584370","13589610"," If you are a supporter, if you are a pro trader, thank you very much for trying to make this"

"13740340","13741520"," How many take a guess out there?"
"13741640","13742280"," How long do you think of them married?"
"13744660","13745960"," Give me a year count."

"13758120","13759200"," Let me think about it right now."
"13763080","13763960"," 69 years. "
"13765460","13768280"," We're about halfway through 69, but not quite a half."
"13768940","13774300"," We're at 69 point four to zero."
"13776460","13778000"," Let me count the real years. "
"13778420","13779140"," See who's got it right."
"13779140","13781900"," Oh, fuck."
"13782300","13783700"," I can't believe I've been married this long. "
"13784820","13786000"," I really can't."
"13787980","13788940"," 24 years."
"13789760","13791360"," I've been married for 24 years. "
"13793060","13794260"," 24 fucking years."
"13795800","13797160"," So I'm committed to you."
"13797460","13800300"," You know, or at least in other parts of my life, you'll know that I'm committed to you. "
"13803500","13804460"," 24 years."
"13805540","13806320"," That's a long time."
"13806320","13809620"," And she's my best friend to this day. "
"13810660","13814040"," People know me here in the show and my wife."
"13814860","13817480"," And she's still to this day my best friend."
"13818000","13819720"," I want you to know that. "
"13819840","13820620"," She's my best friend."
"13820900","13822220"," She is everything to me."
"13822780","13823000"," Always has. "
"13823360","13823640"," Always will be."
"13824020","13825360"," Hope she doesn't leave me as the real point."
"13827980","13829620"," So watch this right here. "
"13829740","13830860"," You see this blood right here?"
"13831560","13832920"," I got some concerns there."
"13836320","13837140"," Need to get higher."
"13837480","13839100"," Well, actually, no, I'm not concerned as concerned. "
"13839300","13839980"," That's actually good."
"13840920","13842260"," So they missed it right here."
"13842420","13843440"," They got it right here. "
"13844420","13846580"," But I really want to see that last move up here."
"13847640","13849320"," Not seeing that's kind of concerned."
"13849900","13850400"," Kind of concerning. "
"13852180","13854200"," Showing me that they're raining boulders down."
"13854820","13856660"," Miro is at the office right now."
"13856780","13857340"," And what he's doing?"
"13857500","13857840"," What's he doing?"
"13858480","13861260"," He's just he's like he's probably got us on right now in the. "
"13862440","13864000"," He's probably got us on right now."
"13864000","13864740"," At the."
"13866300","13867260"," At the hedge fund. "
"13867520","13869180"," And there was like probably a hundred guys in there."
"13869200","13873860"," And they're like, as soon as that guy gets up there with those yellow boxes, just rain shit down in"
"13873860","13874260"," his ass."
"13879330","13880930"," Like we love fucking with this guy. "
"13886310","13887950"," Miro, if you're out there, I love you, man."
"13893750","13895470"," Like an office full of fucking."
"13895710","13898890"," Office full of fucking traders just going, wham, wham. "
"13906910","13908590"," Yeah, boulders, boulder bear."
"13913150","13917230"," They probably find joy in that too."
"13917710","13918350"," I would. "
"13919710","13923170"," If I was in an office full of a bunch of traders and be like, every time that motherfucker is"
"13923170","13926730"," going to target right before he gets there, you just throw out a fucking start selling shit."
"13931510","13932570"," Oh, I don't fuck with them."
"13932950","13933670"," They're my friends. "
"13933930","13936410"," I have a lot of love and friends with these guys."
"13937170","13938210"," Like I love these guys."
"13939250","13940410"," It's still fuck with you though. "
"13950270","13953050"," These guys tell us, man, I get, I get emails from people."
"13953210","13956510"," They're like, do you mind if we re-broadcast your stream and our blog or our discord?"
"13957370","13959490"," Do you mind if we watch it in the office and stuff?"
"13959750","13960670"," Remember, re-broadcast it."
"13960730","13961290"," I'm like, yeah, sure. "
"13961550","13962530"," But we're doing this shit for free."
"13962530","13963850"," So I'm like, whatever you want to do."
"13964230","13965070"," Have fun with it. "
"13965870","13966790"," Dude, everyone I do."
"13966930","13967330"," That's awesome."
"13970610","13971930"," But that's not Miro and his crew. "
"13972170","13972630"," They're the other crews."
"13974170","13976690"," But you know, they, you know why they watch, right?"
"13977270","13978870"," And you don't know the reason that they watch."
"13979370","13982450"," They watch because they want to gauge retail sentiment. "
"13983250","13988450"," So if you're reaching like 3,000 people, 6,000 people, and then you've got their friends telling"
"13988450","13991090"," their friends, that's like 10, 20,000 traders."
"13991790","13992850"," And we're trading spy, right?"
"13993370","13994610"," So we're trading S&P 500."
"13995330","13999150"," How many concentrations of live streams are trading SPY?"
"13999270","13999770"," Not too many. "
"14000310","14000810"," So what do they do?"
"14000890","14001410"," They watch me."
"14001590","14002410"," They watch trading fraternity."
"14003030","14004810"," They watch, um, I don't know. "
"14004810","14006810"," Think or swim the radio broadcast."
"14006970","14011450"," It wouldn't take too many of watching that for retail sentiment to gauge retail sentiment."
"14012930","14013370"," Right. "
"14013590","14016330"," That wouldn't take too much to do that."
"14018190","14018770"," Get it?"
"14019410","14021390"," Like how are retail retail feeling today?"
"14021970","14022590"," They're feeling good."
"14022730","14023190"," They're feeling bad. "
"14023350","14023850"," Let's find out."
"14024630","14025570"," That's what I would do."
"14028790","14029810"," Oh, yeah, definitely. "
"14030350","14031230"," They feel confident."
"14031490","14032810"," They feel scared here."
"14033870","14034870"," They do them in gloom. "
"14035230","14036090"," You want to know that stuff."
"14036250","14037170"," The Fed has admitted to it."
"14037230","14038270"," The banks have admitted to it. "
"14038330","14039270"," They do it on fin to it."
"14039910","14041750"," So I'm sure that they follow real time."
"14041870","14042910"," I would follow real time. "
"14043090","14046150"," I want to build a software that to follow is what I would do."
"14047430","14048770"," You hire somebody out."
"14049010","14052490"," Some kind of written language model to gauge what your sentiment is. "
"14052690","14056690"," Back in the day, dude, we first did this stream."
"14057690","14059750"," I used to show people Twitter fall."
"14060330","14061870"," I don't know if you guys know what Twitter fall is. "
"14061870","14065910"," But Twitter fall, you could put in keywords."
"14067550","14070150"," Like SPY or SPX or ES."
"14071210","14073730"," And you would watch the tweets coming through. "
"14074630","14076870"," People being bullish, people being bearish."
"14077610","14079970"," And track retail or retail sentiment real time."
"14081250","14083510"," I'm sure that some people still pay for that. "
"14083830","14087210"," Now you've paid Elon for it, but it costs big money."
"14087830","14089810"," It's like 40 grand or something like that a month."
"14090910","14092870"," But I'm sure people still pay for it. "
"14093230","14094950"," Get real time retail sentiment."

"14173090","14175330"," So we have some gamma stuff coming out. "
"14175330","14182910"," And we're talking to two gamma people that I really appreciate."
"14183510","14188290"," And we're also talking to a developer about developing our own gamma tools."
"14188590","14196130"," I don't know which way it goes, but we got some cool, cool gamma stuff coming your way. "
"14197170","14198450"," And I can't wait for it."

"14202730","14204710"," I can't talk about any of it."
"14206250","14207730"," But it's coming real soon."
"14213610","14213930"," No. "
"14215110","14216210"," No a la carte."
"14216710","14216790"," Nope."
"14217510","14218410"," No a la carte. "
"14219050","14219850"," I don't find value."
"14220390","14221170"," So I'll be honest with you."
"14221250","14222250"," I want to tell you guys something about. "
"14222370","14223150"," It's a good question, too."
"14223830","14225290"," Someone said no a la carte."
"14225410","14226370"," I'm going to talk to you about that. "
"14227910","14229850"," It's like to me, I look at it like gamma."
"14231530","14234810"," I look at gamma as where's the value?"
"14234810","14235630"," In gamma."
"14235930","14239290"," So I have my own modeling right for gamma that I do. "
"14240290","14242390"," But I don't think there's any value in that."
"14242810","14247790"," I think the value is in who's wielding it, who's trading it, who's doing it."
"14248530","14250590"," And not the actual any tool. "
"14250910","14256870"," I don't believe for a minute that really there's as much value as people think that there are in"
"14256870","14257170"," tools."
"14257850","14260610"," I'm with a spot gamma on this tier one alpha."
"14261490","14262510"," Gamma labs. "
"14264210","14265130"," Gex bot."
"14266190","14270230"," You have like the community and the people that are doing it matter more."
"14270610","14273990"," Like I think my I think my community here you guys right. "
"14274830","14277470"," And us and me matter more."
"14278190","14278870"," So that's right."
"14279130","14280350"," I see the value in that. "
"14281750","14287070"," I have a I have a real like we had a big discussion."
"14289630","14294530"," About where's the value and my take I'm with like I'm with bread on this like."
"14295530","14298330"," You when you guys set up a spot gamma you're signing up for Brent. "
"14298930","14300590"," You're signing up for what they do with gamma."
"14301230","14302270"," In my view."
"14302750","14308070"," Now I know they got cool tools and stuff, but I didn't I just I used to subscribe to them. "
"14308510","14310590"," I'm I'm signing up for spot gamma."
"14311050","14313430"," So it's not to me."
"14313510","14314330"," I'm not going to sell it. "
"14314330","14319090"," No, no, we sell it."
"14320190","14321670"," But not not as all the cart."
"14322170","14322990"," Not as all the cart. "
"14323830","14324790"," It's a whole package."
"14326710","14328890"," It's about it's I think it's a great package."
"14329170","14329270"," So. "
"14330670","14332750"," But not not all the cart not going to do it."
"14334670","14336090"," I don't want to put a price on it."
"14336250","14336590"," So. "
"14338150","14339410"," I think it's invaluable."
"14339810","14341610"," I think I think the entire package is valuable."
"14341890","14344470"," You get the triggers and the velocity you get the tool. "
"14344470","14348150"," You can walk away with it if you want, but you get the whole package with us."
"14350860","14352820"," If I was going to sell it."
"14353280","14353840"," Thousand bucks. "
"14354800","14355820"," You want to pay a grand for it?"
"14356580","14358160"," I'll put that on it if you want."
"14358700","14359160"," Five grand."
"14360340","14360960"," Ten grand. "
"14361260","14361560"," Twenty grand."
"14361820","14362080"," Thirty grand."
"14363100","14364160"," I'm not I'm not here to sell it. "
"14364160","14364520"," I don't want to."
"14367510","14368730"," When did I change my mind?"
"14369710","14373410"," We were discussing I was discussing with I was discussing with Aaron."
"14373410","14375510"," I'm like, are we selling tools?"
"14376730","14380230"," Or are we are we selling us?"
"14380730","14381510"," Like, what are we?"
"14381610","14382090"," What are we doing?"
"14382910","14384910"," And I think it's I think it's us. "
"14385250","14389470"," I don't think that it's like I don't think that it's what I thought it was."
"14390250","14396190"," I have more I think there's more value in our community than there is in any fucking tool."
"14396630","14397410"," Any tool. "
"14399010","14405290"," And I still feel like that about people out there too, you know, like, like, I put more trust in"
"14405290","14408350"," like David than I do in any fucking tool."
"14408890","14411930"," I put more trust in Joe than I do in any tool."
"14412190","14414910"," I put more trust in you more than any tool. "
"14415270","14416650"," The person that's talking about it."
"14416970","14422470"," When Scott comes on to the show, I put trust in Scott, not in volatility, put it in Scott."
"14422470","14426050"," When trader podcast comes on the show, I put my trust in and trader podcast. "
"14427190","14432170"," You know, when career low comes on the show and does stuff, I put my trust in him."
"14432370","14435750"," When John L comes on and talks about stuff, I put my trust in him."
"14435970","14436470"," Ray Vology. "
"14436670","14437450"," It doesn't matter who they are."
"14437570","14441290"," E trading shorts, those people, like real true people."
"14442250","14445370"," I put my faith in trust in that more than any tool that's out there. "
"14447410","14448050"," Bob Kendall."
"14449210","14449850"," Andy Conston."
"14449990","14450390"," You name it. "
"14450530","14451110"," Jedi Marcus."
"14452570","14454170"," Put my trust in that person."
"14454410","14455670"," The person that's wielding it too. "
"14457550","14457870"," Yeah."
"14458010","14458070"," Yeah."
"14458270","14458970"," I'm not mattering it. "
"14459050","14462630"," So it's just, I don't think that I think that building that value into that."
"14462770","14463390"," I think it's bullshit."
"14463570","14465510"," I think it really is the people that are doing it. "
"14478860","14482460"," It really is like when I first started trading, right?"
"14482620","14483340"," I would like read a book."
"14483480","14484280"," Someone just set it up there."
"14484460","14486220"," Like, when you read a book, you're like, what does this mean?"
"14486220","14488560"," Then you watch a video and you're like, yeah, what does that mean?"
"14488960","14491740"," Like that whole mentorship aspect is different. "
"14492060","14493620"," That community aspect is different."
"14494320","14499000"," When your community takes time out to teach you, when I take time out to teach you, when you see"
"14499000","14502120"," me here with you all day long, it's different."
"14503080","14503660"," It's different. "
"14505980","14507200"," It's absolutely different."
"14513610","14514770"," Yeah, it's different."
"14515090","14515590"," It's a different thing. "
"14516210","14517710"," I'm here with you guys every day."
"14517710","14519430"," You guys, it's you guys and me."
"14519970","14520830"," It really is. "
"14522170","14523450"," Bork's turned me on to this too."
"14523590","14530290"," Like Bork's like, you know, it's like, we had our first discord, right?"
"14531750","14533930"," And John L was in there, Ravology."
"14535810","14537110"," He traded shorts, a bunch of guys, right?"
"14537270","14538070"," These guys are all traders. "
"14539250","14540830"," And they're running around being administrators."
"14541490","14545550"," And I'm like, why the fuck do we have badasses administrating?"
"14546290","14547950"," And then we got Bork."
"14548870","14550150"," And Bork's a newest trader. "
"14551130","14553050"," But Bork has a ton of experience in discord."
"14554110","14561590"," And if he can administrate that stuff and make a great community, that frees up other people to do"
"14561590","14562670"," what they do, right?"
"14563390","14565530"," So I believe in that."
"14565610","14566290"," I believe in people. "
"14570850","14572570"," I think people matter."
"14573030","14574210"," I don't know."
"14574330","14575490"," That's my thesis there. "
"14581050","14582850"," This is going to be fascinating right here."
"14582910","14584050"," I want to see what happens here."
"14584790","14589150"," The reason being is we, it took us two tries to break this high. "
"14589990","14590910"," That's a lot of work."
"14591010","14592370"," This is showing some pinning action."
"14592830","14594790"," We didn't get the new high though in the second pump. "
"14595530","14599170"," And due to that, this action right here is going to matter."
"14599390","14606890"," If the bulls can't get up here, the bulls can't get up here really fast, we will go down and"
"14606890","14610030"," check a pivot point to the downside."
"14611230","14612770"," And where is that pivot point?"
"14613850","14616050"," So we already checked this down here, right?"
"14616950","14618150"," We already checked all this. "
"14622120","14623200"," Let me just get rid of it."
"14623420","14624780"," Well, let me make it translucent."
"14627300","14627780"," Okay. "
"14628100","14629600"," I can make that translucent right now."
"14629740","14630120"," No, no, no, no."
"14630260","14632240"," That was just the fold down on this one. "
"14633260","14634040"," Make that transfer."
"14634200","14634960"," No, the other way."
"14636500","14638120"," I might be able to see the ticks in here. "
"14638620","14639680"," Let's see the ticks down there."
"14640920","14642660"," So we already checked down here, right?"
"14643420","14645340"," And buyers said, nope, we own this, right?"
"14645600","14645900"," It's ours."
"14646160","14646640"," It's ours. "
"14647000","14647460"," It's ours."
"14648120","14649020"," Get a good bond auction."
"14649360","14649740"," It's ours. "
"14652340","14654940"," And now you're getting a little bit of, no, it's not yours."
"14655900","14661120"," So we either have some coiling going on or an explosive move."
"14663810","14668550"," We're going to get a concentration of sellers to the concentration of buyers. "
"14670550","14672850"," And we're going to break one way or the other."
"14673050","14676090"," We're either going to break up or we're going to break down, right?"
"14677390","14678110"," Where is that?"
"14679070","14681670"," Or we could pin into the clothes, park in the bus."
"14683430","14685050"," But we're going to break over this. "
"14685550","14688410"," This is going to break one way or the other, right?"
"14689130","14691610"," So where's the downside target if we do break lower?"
"14693130","14694750"," We already hit this one here."
"14695590","14698690"," We supposedly have support here, right?"
"14701470","14703090"," We know we have known support there."
"14704110","14706310"," Is it good enough that we come down here?"
"14707490","14708970"," We're right down in blast down. "
"14709490","14711390"," Just to check that, maybe it's possible."
"14712230","14715230"," That would give an exchange expansion, wouldn't it?"
"14716610","14718410"," A little bit of range expansion there."
"14718510","14719330"," Whoopsie, sorry for that. "
"14721250","14721610"," Right?"
"14721870","14724990"," So let's draw this out and see what we're looking at here."
"14725070","14725530"," Let's take a peek."
"14726670","14727890"," Let's check the screen really quick. "
"14728870","14730150"," Let's get rid of this stuff now."
"14730230","14731210"," Get the shit out of the way, okay?"
"14732590","14741230"," So we're being told right now, being told right now, the sellers are like, no, no, bro."
"14741430","14741850"," We're right here. "
"14741950","14743070"," We're stronger than the buyers."
"14743470","14744710"," That's what they're trying to tell us, right?"
"14745550","14747310"," So we'll go with something traditional here."
"14753540","14755280"," It's a little bit more traditional here, right?"
"14755640","14756860"," It's a little bit like that, right?"
"14757820","14758240"," See that?"
"14760560","14762100"," You got the sellers right here. "
"14763000","14763900"," The buyers right here."
"14765040","14766120"," And what are we doing here?"
"14766660","14768680"," Do, do, do, go up there, go up there, go up there."
"14769360","14770760"," Maybe down there, maybe down there. "
"14770880","14772160"," There's some range expansion, right?"
"14772680","14772880"," See it?"
"14774280","14775960"," We have known buyers right here."
"14781030","14781430"," Make sense?"
"14783410","14784930"," I'll get rid of that for you right now."
"14786570","14788830"," We have a pin above at what, 520?"
"14789750","14791210"," Way up there into Friday, right?"
"14791610","14792410"," Way up there. "
"14795050","14796410"," Let's see what happens here."
"14805730","14807210"," Next target right there."
"14811480","14814440"," And next target down here is where this is roadmap. "
"14815240","14817280"," Cap wants to buy the cheaper calls down here."
"14820140","14820960"," See it now?"
"14821160","14823120"," Look at a little bit down there, right down there."
"14824100","14827420"," Go a little bit of that up there, going up there, a larger frame. "
"14827640","14829020"," Maybe we can get down there a little bit."
"14829380","14830740"," Cap gets to buy that right there."
"14838610","14845410"," In 10 minutes time at 2pm Eastern, we have comments from RBNZ Conway who is speaking on a Kiwi Bank"
"14845410","14845710"," event. "
"14846010","14847190"," There is no text expected."
"14848170","14851910"," If we make the break above this one right here, we'll take this long."
"14854710","14856490"," Let's see if the bull's got it or not. "
"14857790","14859550"," You're already broke above this one right here."
"14864230","14866350"," Let's do some, you guys want some upside targets?"
"14866510","14867430"," Hold on, I'll give you the upside targets."
"14871030","14872050"," You want an upside target?"
"14872270","14873470"," You guys want to get all hot and bothered?"
"14874550","14875770"," You guys like Cap are going up. "
"14876670","14877710"," I'll show you the upside path."
"14884900","14885520"," Right there."
"14889610","14890770"," You want the upside path?"
"14892710","14893890"," I'll give it to you, you want it?"
"14895610","14895990"," Right there. "
"14898330","14899850"," That's your upside path right there."
"14899930","14902310"," Target 51915."
"14905370","14914490"," If you think that we're in this like coiling and we're going down, your downside target is 51548"
"14914490","14921810"," right here, the circle, and the erasing of yesterday's squeeze into the close from 1.30 in the"
"14921810","14922050"," afternoon. "
"14922870","14925350"," And that's where I want to buy right down there with some conviction."
"14936580","14938360"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"14948250","14948870"," Nasdaq. "
"14951210","14952170"," Right here."
"14952570","14954250"," Are you guys ready to ask that care for you?"
"14954670","14957150"," I got a target above of 448."
"14959570","14961910"," 450 is your target for Friday. "
"14962590","14964950"," You want your Friday target for our queues?"
"14965530","14965730"," 450."
"14972740","14974880"," 450 for Friday."
"14975920","14977640"," And one other note here would be. "
"14979020","14982300"," I know there's a lot of talk out there of a roll down."
"14983660","14986180"," Once the once the gamma comes off."
"14987080","14988980"," So gear, pens and papers out at home. "
"14989000","14989300"," Okay."
"14989640","14994840"," If you're not a supporter, if you're not a supporter, get a paper out, get a note pad out, whatever"
"14994840","14995220"," it is."
"14995300","14995820"," Write this down. "
"14995820","14996100"," Okay."
"14998460","15000200"," I'll give you a second."
"15002580","15011760"," The current consensus is that there is a window of weakness opening on Friday when"
"15011760","15018840"," this pin of 5200 for calls and puts comes off the market. "
"15019760","15029540"," When those contracts all end and that we are going to roll down into next week for Monday"
"15029540","15030300"," through Friday."
"15031080","15033720"," And notes to that as well."
"15034560","15041580"," Seasonally, the low in the market should be on the next Friday, the 22nd of March. "
"15043480","15046640"," So there's some people that are like, yeah, we got some shit."
"15046880","15048760"," Hey, we got the right decision coming, right?"
"15048960","15050420"," We got all kinds of fun stuff coming."
"15050840","15052500"," We have tons of all lined up. "
"15052500","15056540"," We are prime for that downside move prime."
"15059300","15061500"," My take on it right now."
"15062160","15063140"," And I'm hedged here. "
"15063600","15065840"," I've got hedging on right into the 28th."
"15069280","15073700"," My thesis here is we are continuing to push higher."
"15074360","15080540"," I know it's a function two of gamma, but there are some signs out there that I'm seeing. "
"15080820","15084760"," Like when I see Apple down and Google down and I see Tesla down and all that shit."
"15085240","15087000"," And I'm like, they got a rate decision coming."
"15087500","15093060"," I don't know that it matters if they cut rates or not, but it may get some smelling it. "
"15093900","15096500"," Smelling like from this is from time in market, right?"
"15097700","15101480"," I'm smelling that like that squeeze, that stinky squeeze."
"15104980","15111640"," So if we have a gamma coming off the market on Friday, the consensus is there's a window to go"
"15111640","15111880"," down."
"15112740","15114280"," So how do I trade that?"
"15115760","15124140"," If I trade it by sending my account into puts, put spreads, and we squeeze up, I'm going to blow"
"15124140","15124900"," myself up. "
"15125540","15127740"," I'm going to blow up my account if we go the wrong way."
"15128360","15130860"," There's some trades I could take to not that have that happen."
"15130860","15133800"," I can take on some some ratio spreads. "
"15134720","15138360"," Two puts one call, something like that to combat that."
"15138560","15141940"," But if my thesis is, if the current thesis is, we're going down."
"15142220","15144380"," Come away speaking on a Kiwi bank event. "
"15144940","15146080"," There will be no text."
"15146620","15149220"," How do I, how do I, how do I trade that?"
"15150460","15156160"," So as a, if I was from the perspective of believing that thesis, the first thing I would do."
"15156860","15166820"," First thing I would do would say to myself, I want to see price reject below the hourly trigger"
"15166820","15169440"," and start heading down. "
"15170380","15173600"," And to that point, that's still a pullback."
"15174120","15179620"," If we are actually going to correct, I want to see price go below the daily trigger."
"15180240","15182520"," I want to see the hourly trigger go below the daily trigger. "
"15182520","15186740"," And I want to see a rejection trade to make an actual correction happen."
"15187620","15188580"," That hasn't happened."
"15189980","15194920"," Now I've been told by people out there, well cap, you'll just wake up tomorrow and we'll be down"
"15194920","15195660"," 200 points. "
"15196020","15197360"," You see that shit, it's all over Twitter."
"15198740","15199560"," Don't worry cap."
"15200520","15201980"," You're going to wake up next week. "
"15202720","15207180"," You keep fucking around out there and you're going to wake up and we're down 200 points and you're"
"15207180","15207620"," going to be doomed."
"15208820","15210140"," Don't dome to the head."
"15210360","15210780"," Merked. "
"15211960","15213960"," So I'm like, that guy's got a good guy."
"15214140","15215300"," That guy's making sense to me."
"15215620","15216680"," How do I combat that?"
"15218800","15222820"," For what I'm seeing, plain old puts that are 10 cents. "
"15223920","15224260"," When?"
"15224920","15226120"," When do you put those on?"
"15226720","15227720"," What's the date on them?"
"15228400","15229720"," I'm going to take it out as insurance."
"15230900","15232780"," Right now price is above the hourly trigger."
"15233000","15234300"," The hourly trigger is above the daily trigger. "
"15234300","15237020"," So we are buyers of dips until proven otherwise."
"15237940","15238960"," What does that mean?"
"15239640","15242400"," That means that I'm buying the fucking dip on any pullback."
"15243340","15243640"," Right?"
"15244440","15250540"," And it means when I come into resistance, especially right now with this perceived window of"
"15250540","15257140"," weakness, that when we come into that resistance, I'll throw on some weekly puts for cheap. "
"15257640","15265700"," So if we hit 5,200 right now on SPX until Friday, I sprinkle on some 10 cent puts for"
"15265700","15267140"," next Friday."
"15268140","15270460"," Cheap dirt cheap costs to do in business."
"15271960","15273660"," I can do that probably three times. "
"15273880","15279760"," I can do it into Friday because I have a good positive that we're going to go there into Friday,"
"15279760","15280500"," 5,200."
"15281360","15283620"," I can do it on Monday if we squeeze up into Monday."
"15284660","15287720"," And if anything else happens, I'll do it again next week. "
"15288000","15288740"," It costs me 30 cents."
"15288740","15289720"," Cheap."
"15290300","15292240"," It's not a $20 Tesla call. "
"15292620","15294020"," It's dirt fucking cheap protection."
"15294980","15295720"," Make sense?"
"15296640","15302240"," So if I wake up on a Monday, if I wake up on Wednesday next week during this window of"
"15302240","15304840"," weakness and we're down 200 points."
"15306040","15306640"," Well, shit. "
"15307400","15310260"," My call or my bullish thesis is way up."
"15310940","15312820"," Pay me 100%, 200%, 300%."
"15312820","15319040"," If that fails, that 10 cent call is going to pay me, a 10 cent put is going to pay"
"15319040","15319360"," me what?"
"15320720","15326400"," 30,000%, 20,000%, 10,000%. "
"15326400","15327740"," There's a rule in there too."
"15328280","15333960"," If we begin to roll and I have 10 cent puts for next week, I do not only take 100 "
"15333960","15334760","% of that trade."
"15335140","15340360"," I hold that shit to get the 1000%, the 3000% or whatever it is. "
"15340760","15344700"," So I have to commit to that trade as well, right?"
"15345480","15348720"," Now, what else is the key point that I left out in this conversation?"
"15349780","15352080"," I didn't tell you one piece of this."
"15353440","15361940"," When that gamma comes off on Friday for 5,200, what's the other thing that happens?"
"15363340","15369880"," The door that's locked at 5,200 gets unlocked."
"15370630","15376880"," Is there any sentiment in the market or from retailers?"
"15377660","15378380"," That's negative. "
"15378640","15380000"," Can you comment from all the ends?"
"15380140","15380380"," No."
"15382080","15382660"," None."
"15383380","15384960"," You speak to anybody out there. "
"15385360","15386680"," You speak to any participant."
"15387620","15388580"," They're going to tell you."
"15389640","15390360"," We're going there. "
"15391720","15397900"," And we're going to blast off through fall and winter through the election and maybe even into"
"15397900","15398200"," March."
"15399560","15408080"," The non-participants bowl is in the corner crying right now begging for a pullback."
"15409480","15410780"," Well, what is their sentiment?"
"15412940","15413940"," We're in a bull market. "
"15414180","15415700"," I just want to get in and go to the top with you."
"15415860","15416780"," Please give me a pullback."
"15419680","15421200"," So into this weekend. "
"15422940","15425720"," The door also opens to the upside."
"15425720","15429340"," And that's my thing."
"15429560","15432400"," That's my like, eh, what if we go up?"
"15433860","15438420"," We've been going up until it's broken. "
"15439380","15440140"," You don't fix it."
"15440780","15445800"," We know what happens with people that call the correction, right?"
"15446900","15454060"," Unless they unless they have a confirmation of a correction or even that we're in the zone of"
"15454060","15454280"," correction."
"15456160","15458220"," They've gotten blown the fuck out every time. "
"15459300","15460880"," Now we're up to what 11 times?"
"15461360","15462760"," We just had one last week, right?"
"15466580","15469580"," So until it breaks until we have a conference."
"15469780","15471380"," You want to you want me to share what that looks like?"
"15471500","15472140"," I can show it to you."
"15472960","15474040"," I'll show you right now. "
"15476020","15476780"," Hold on here."
"15476780","15477540"," I'll show you what it correct."
"15477820","15479860"," I'll show you when we're in a confirmed correction. "
"15480200","15481260"," I'm going to show you what it looks like."
"15483920","15487900"," If you want to go on fint to it and say, we are correcting."
"15490940","15494400"," Not throwing, not just fucking saying bullshit. "
"15495220","15495900"," I'll show it to you."
"15496300","15497280"," I'll show exactly what it looks like."
"15497440","15498680"," I'll show it to you in the cues. "
"15499320","15500560"," No, no, the better one is spot."
"15501400","15502320"," I'll show it to you in spot."
"15503680","15504620"," Pink tight here. "
"15508360","15509200"," Sorry about that."
"15509880","15513540"," I'm going to show you in spy what a confirmed correction looks like."
"15514040","15515520"," You people at home that have the tool. "
"15515800","15517080"," I'm going to show you what it looks like."
"15518040","15520440"," You people at home that have access to the tool."
"15520660","15521820"," I'll show you what it looks like. "
"15522220","15522960"," It's very simple."
"15524820","15526540"," You want to be a badass on Twitter?"
"15528700","15530200"," I'll show you exactly what it looks like."
"15532040","15533160"," Come on down a cap. "
"15533900","15534880"," It's funny too."
"15534960","15536720"," We're in here trading a one minute trigger."
"15537300","15538160"," It's like, boom. "
"15538940","15544160"," And we're trading like a fucking 15 minute bar."
"15548800","15550340"," Let me get rid of that."
"15551560","15554040"," Let me show you what a correction looks like. "
"15556840","15559120"," This is a daily chart."
"15562180","15563460"," This is a day chart."
"15564360","15566040"," I'll actually show it to you in a 30 minute chart. "
"15566160","15566900"," It'd be nice and cleaner."
"15568900","15569460"," There we go."
"15569560","15569900"," It's even better. "
"15570000","15571260"," It's a gorgeous way to look at it."
"15572900","15575680"," I'm going to show you what a confirmed correction looks like."
"15577040","15578160"," You want to start calling. "
"15578300","15579540"," You want to be a badass out there."
"15581200","15583860"," You want to be like, you want to get a hundred thousand followers."
"15585380","15586440"," You sell doom. "
"15587580","15592260"," If you want to get low followers, but be right."
"15593240","15595180"," If you actually want to be right."
"15598320","15601160"," If you actually want to be right, I'm going to show you exactly what it looks like. "
"15612650","15614570"," Price comes down right here."
"15614990","15617270"," Okay, breaks below the daily trigger."
"15619450","15620710"," I don't like that. "
"15620850","15621810"," Hold on a second here."
"15623250","15624390"," It's too thick."
"15624390","15624530"," Too thick. "
"15624970","15625790"," Too thick."
"15626510","15627210"," Way too thick."
"15628510","15631170"," So price breaks down right here below the daily trigger. "
"15631510","15631530"," Okay."
"15632410","15634010"," And you're like, cap, you didn't call it."
"15634990","15636850"," You see all these pullbacks here?"
"15637530","15639730"," You don't call corrections on these pullbacks. "
"15641590","15647210"," Every single time we come back up."
"15650250","15651230"," Okay, right there."
"15651230","15653250"," We always come back up every time. "
"15654590","15661570"," What you are looking for is for the hourly trigger to come down with price."
"15662450","15663770"," This is a key point."
"15665070","15670050"," If you don't see the hourly trigger come down, that's not a correction either. "
"15671250","15676390"," Sometimes the hourly trigger will continue higher even though price is down there."
"15676390","15682830"," If you have the hourly trigger at home, you can actually see that in prior examples."
"15683410","15687490"," But you also want to see the hourly trigger come down with price at the same time. "
"15688890","15690130"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"15690350","15699390"," If you see that hourly trigger come down here and you then get a rejection of price right there."
"15703290","15705190"," That's when you know we are correcting. "
"15707110","15711930"," In the moment you see that happen, you can go on fin-twit."
"15712330","15713930"," You can go on stock-twits."
"15714550","15716390"," You can go on fucking Wall Street bets. "
"15717290","15719610"," You can scream it out your fucking window whatever you want."
"15719770","15723030"," And you can say, we are now in a correction."
"15723950","15725850"," Now we could still resolve to the upside. "
"15726670","15727510"," We could turn around and go up."
"15728430","15732810"," But when we're here, we are in a correction zone."
"15733270","15734470"," We are at risk of correcting. "
"15734470","15738850"," You might be thinking to yourself, we'll cap I missed all this right here."
"15740190","15740630"," Right?"
"15741170","15744150"," You can trade this, but you close your trade here."
"15744910","15746490"," You get what I'm saying, you close it. "
"15747330","15753230"," You wait for this to develop because this is what happens to you while you're out there looking"
"15753230","15757870"," like a jackass calling it a correction or looking like a jackass saying we're going to roll over."
"15758630","15759070"," Right?"
"15759230","15762350"," Or you're still short or any of that bullshit."
"15762970","15767170"," Until you see this, you should have closed your short. "
"15768050","15773290"," You should be like on fin-twit going, I took my trade, my pullback trade."
"15774150","15775510"," I'm waiting for this."
"15776730","15781890"," And if I see that, I will let you know because we are now in a correction. "
"15783010","15786850"," And you might be thinking to yourself, well, okay, I took this, I made that money."
"15787730","15789090"," And now we have this forming."
"15789510","15792430"," You would go on to fin-twit and say, hey, we're in a correction. "
"15793070","15796310"," Unless this resolves itself, we're in a correction."
"15796650","15797350"," And where are we going?"
"15798270","15798830"," Well, shit."
"15800570","15802590"," This is where the real money comes in. "
"15803390","15806570"," This is where you go, you know, I was trading a thousand bucks."
"15806830","15807730"," I was trading five grand."
"15807970","15808710"," I was trading ten grand. "
"15809090","15810610"," This is when the real big boys come out."
"15811230","15814250"," This is when they go boom, hundred thousand dollars."
"15814790","15815750"," Let's make some fucking money. "
"15815750","15817850"," I've been waiting for fucking a year to do this."
"15818890","15824290"," And they go, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"15824610","15828010"," This is high probability trading here. "
"15828890","15830350"," Only two right here."
"15831610","15836510"," This trade right here, like 60% probability, 70% probability."
"15837210","15838430"," Maybe even higher, like 90. "
"15839970","15841690"," You get off on that shit."
"15841690","15844650"," And you crank this thing down right to the weekly trigger."
"15846050","15847190"," What do you do there?"
"15847810","15849550"," Do you like stay short in that correction?"
"15850090","15850570"," Fuck no. "
"15851630","15852470"," Fuck no."
"15852890","15854330"," You stand here and you wait."
"15855270","15856870"," And then you see what happened. "
"15857630","15858390"," Hold on here."
"15862070","15863570"," What are you watching for?"
"15865590","15866430"," You're watching."
"15866670","15867250"," Oh, shit. "
"15867390","15868070"," I messed all that up."
"15868170","15868610"," Hold on here."
"15869230","15870830"," I think I deleted all that. "
"15870830","15875630"," But you're watching for the hourly of the daily trigger to now come down, right?"
"15876670","15883090"," If it doesn't come down, correction over the daily triggers down here, but coming back up again,"
"15883410","15888870"," it's a leading indicator leading indicator that we're not correcting anymore when price is down"
"15888870","15890050"," here, right?"
"15890350","15891190"," It's pulling up."
"15891610","15892870"," Price will go up with it."
"15893770","15898670"," But if you see the daily trigger coming down here and you get the weekly trigger. "
"15899770","15903670"," And I'm going to show you an example of this, right?"
"15904850","15910390"," And you got price coming down, comes down, breaks underneath, slams down in here, starts to do this"
"15910390","15910670"," shit."
"15911510","15911910"," What happens?"
"15913250","15913570"," Down side."
"15914410","15915270"," Where's your next target?"
"15915530","15916590"," Now you're Johnny on the spot. "
"15917490","15918330"," Your next target."
"15922170","15925130"," Your next target is the monthly trigger down here."
"15926090","15928110"," Do you want to see an example of this?"
"15928450","15929530"," I'll show it to you. "
"15930350","15931950"," You want to see an example of it?"
"15932410","15933330"," I'll show it to you."
"15934330","15935590"," Let me show it to you."
"15938730","15940070"," Let me show you an example. "
"15947160","15949300"," Let me show you an example here."
"15950940","15952360"," Let me show you fun times."
"15953680","15958040"," Let me show you a difference. "
"15959660","15960700"," Do you see?"
"15962540","15963780"," Plan is day."
"15964740","15967840"," Do you see the daily trigger coming down in this correction?"
"15969580","15972240"," Did it cross the orange line?"
"15972800","15973500"," No."
"15976690","15979090"," And we have price way down here. "
"15979230","15980210"," We have low prices."
"15981210","15983110"," Do you see the divergence here?"
"15984630","15985790"," Between price?"
"15986610","15989370"," No, the daily trigger price and the weekly trigger."
"15990150","15990710"," Divergence. "
"15991490","15993110"," Do you see here though?"
"15994450","15995790"," The yellow cross."
"15997050","15997970"," The orange."
"15998430","15998890"," That's bad. "
"16001410","16002770"," That's really bad, right?"
"16003370","16004270"," Rejects up here."
"16004530","16004850"," Comes down."
"16005150","16005430"," Bloodbath. "
"16005710","16005750"," Crash."
"16006930","16007330"," Make sense?"
"16008190","16009530"," Let me show you some others back here."
"16011390","16012390"," Look at all this. "
"16012730","16012930"," Correction."
"16013390","16013570"," Correction."
"16013970","16014190"," Correction. "
"16014850","16015150"," That's it."
"16016110","16016310"," Right?"
"16016310","16019650"," No break of the weekly, is it?"
"16020010","16022390"," Weekly is going up in a straight line too, isn't it?"
"16022850","16024510"," What else can you find out from this?"
"16024690","16025330"," What else do you see?"
"16025970","16027270"," The orange line is going vertical."
"16027970","16029170"," The orange line is flat. "
"16030630","16030990"," Right?"
"16031570","16032810"," Neutral now, right?"
"16033090","16033930"," On a weekly basis."
"16036670","16038070"," What is this right here?"
"16039610","16040630"," Stock market crash."
"16042630","16044650"," Weekly is now coming down, right?"
"16045450","16046670"," Now we're down in the monthly. "
"16047590","16049370"," What do we know about being on the monthly?"
"16050110","16052770"," The stock market is an actual bear market then."
"16053410","16058150"," If we break below in all of these, if the weekly, the daily break below the monthly, we know that"
"16058150","16059130"," we're in a stock market crash."
"16060190","16063170"," This is back in March of 2023, right?"
"16063890","16065290"," This right here is in October. "
"16066190","16068610"," What do we see happening here in October?"
"16069630","16071650"," We see the daily trigger fighting back up."
"16071990","16073630"," We see reversal of the weekly trigger."
"16074090","16076430"," Weekly trigger is not going down anymore, is it?"
"16076850","16077550"," It's turning up. "
"16078030","16079270"," The weekly is turning up."
"16079390","16080410"," The daily is turning up."
"16080770","16082230"," And what else do we see here in October?"
"16082910","16083590"," What else do we see?"
"16084290","16087250"," The fucking monthly is no longer going down. "
"16087430","16088050"," It's going up."
"16089430","16091730"," This is telling you that this is a bottom."
"16092710","16094470"," It's telling you we're going that way. "
"16095330","16099670"," And then you get a guy like me on Fintuit that brings out the meme with the baseball bat and"
"16099670","16101110"," I go, we're going up."
"16101110","16104890"," And they tell you, oh, no, we're underneath the 50 weekly EMA or something."
"16105350","16107190"," 50 WMA and shit like that. "
"16107290","16108810"," The weekly moving average cap were fucked."
"16109790","16110830"," And I go, no, we're not."
"16111410","16112930"," And then I tell you in December. "
"16113030","16114090"," And then I tell you in March."
"16114450","16116050"," And then I see range expansion."
"16116730","16117830"," Do you guys remember that on the show?"
"16118290","16125830"," I go, not only do we moving up, but we now have a separation of price, daily, weekly and monthly. "
"16126690","16128670"," Do you know how long these last four?"
"16129510","16131110"," About a year and a half at minimum."
"16131950","16133330"," Do you know what this means?"
"16134230","16135370"," No more volatility."
"16136650","16138830"," Do you know when people are here telling you we're going to crash?"
"16139310","16140870"," They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. "
"16143510","16144510"," And watch that."
"16145490","16145890"," Up down."
"16146290","16146670"," Check it again. "
"16147330","16147390"," Bam."
"16147930","16148050"," Up."
"16149090","16149150"," Right. "
"16149590","16150750"," And look at this right here."
"16151170","16152130"," Do you guys remember this?"
"16152390","16153870"," This was November of 23."
"16155310","16159010"," I was on this show with you guys and I said, we're in danger. "
"16159010","16162270"," We're in danger right here before knowing any of this shit."
"16162590","16163470"," I'm like, we're danger."
"16164390","16166750"," And then as soon as it resolved itself. "
"16167510","16168750"," And the daily broke above."
"16169330","16170410"," I said to people."
"16171070","16173270"," The risk has resolved. "
"16173370","16174950"," We're going that way."
"16176010","16177190"," Ensure that shit."
"16177850","16179030"," With impunity. "
"16180230","16180750"," Impunity."
"16181790","16183210"," We're trading all of this."
"16184370","16188350"," So right now at this moment, let me ask you a question. "
"16190770","16191970"," Are we in a correction?"
"16193290","16193850"," No."
"16196150","16197450"," We aren't, aren't we?"
"16198710","16202950"," Is there anything here telling you that we're in a correction?"
"16203970","16204030"," No."
"16205090","16206110"," We're getting pullbacks. "
"16206530","16206790"," Pullback."
"16207150","16207430"," Pullback."
"16208230","16208650"," Pullback. "
"16208950","16209190"," Pullback."
"16209790","16212530"," What should you have done going all the way back?"
"16213750","16217110"," You should have bought every fucking time we hit that daily trigger, right?"
"16217110","16218710"," Until you're wrong."
"16220310","16224010"," Until you see the daily trigger start to come down, right?"
"16224750","16227170"," Until you start to see the weekly trigger start to roll. "
"16228350","16232430"," Until we're maxed out in velocity on the monthly."
"16232810","16235170"," Maxed out in velocity on the weekly."
"16235930","16243530"," When we have topped on weekly velocity, monthly velocity, you will see a decline in that velocity. "
"16243530","16246750"," And you will see that we won't even hold it anymore."
"16247390","16248790"," We top out on weekly velocity."
"16248910","16250530"," We'll break through it, right?"
"16251290","16252470"," We know it won't hold. "
"16254730","16259230"," If you start to see, let's say, a weekly velocity maxing out at a plus 100."
"16259730","16262690"," You see monthly velocity maxing out at a plus 100."
"16263050","16266670"," And then you start to see that velocity go down like now it's gone down to 75. "
"16267850","16268010"," 25."
"16269470","16269970"," Minus 50."
"16269970","16272170"," And you see price still climbing. "
"16272850","16275630"," That is predictive of a crash coming."
"16276590","16281150"," And it's also predictive that the daily trigger will no longer hold."
"16281630","16283910"," That the weekly trigger will no longer hold. "
"16284390","16288170"," And that when we test those prices, that we will break through them."
"16289130","16295890"," So you even have not only a predictive behavior, but you even know if they're going to hold or not."
"16297790","16301930"," And that's when you're going to divergence in velocity and price. "
"16304250","16308790"," If we're not maxed out on a weekly velocity, we know it will hold."
"16309710","16313390"," We know that as velocity climbs, that's strong."
"16314230","16318730"," Once it peaks and rolls over, we know that that shit ain't holding for nobody. "
"16319290","16320810"," We're going to blast right through that shit."
"16327810","16338340"," So right now in this market, even with a pullback, even in"
"16338340","16340640"," a pullback situation, you buy the fucking dip."
"16341960","16347980"," And if we see the daily trigger roll down, we break the daily trigger and the daily trigger starts"
"16347980","16350560"," to chase us, we get scared as fuck, right?"
"16351820","16355000"," So if we see that on the show, we're going to get scared, aren't we?"
"16355780","16359540"," We can start to not even say we're getting a correction or a market crash. "
"16360240","16361620"," We can say, oh shit."
"16363500","16363960"," Right?"
"16364440","16366740"," I can tell you right now that weekly ain't going to hold."
"16367360","16368460"," I can look at it right now. "
"16368480","16369520"," It's diverging from price."
"16370280","16370660"," Make sense?"
"16383200","16389580"," You're not, you're unsure because when you're in positive velocity, it is supportive of markets."
"16390240","16396840"," When you max out on velocity, right, and you start to go negative on velocity, we become less"
"16396840","16398180"," supportive on the triggers. "
"16398860","16399560"," Does that make sense?"
"16401980","16403140"," I'll explain it better for you."
"16403520","16404840"," I'll explain it very simply."
"16408349","16412189"," On any velocity, this is daily velocity right here, right?"
"16413150","16420970"," If daily velocity is up and it's rolling down and this is the daily trigger and price is coming"
"16420970","16424110"," down into it, I'm going to get really simple for you. "
"16426369","16429930"," And price is coming down and velocity is right here."
"16430230","16431730"," I'm going to expect us to break through."
"16432630","16434450"," Okay, price to break through. "
"16435450","16438290"," Oh shit."
"16440470","16442410"," I meant to just erase it."
"16442849","16444710"," So this is the daily trigger, right?"
"16447750","16450130"," This is price coming down to the daily trigger, right?"
"16453390","16454849"," This is daily velocity. "
"16455650","16467020"," If daily velocity is up and rolling over, I am not"
"16467020","16476480"," going to expect the trigger to hold if velocity was"
"16480220","16480779"," negative."
"16482560","16492040"," If velocity was underneath minus 50 minus 100, and price was coming down into the daily trigger,"
"16493380","16495259"," price was coming down here, right?"
"16495259","16500680"," I already know from a velocity standpoint that there's something coming up from underneath."
"16501419","16506680"," So when we come down here to tag, I'm going to expect that velocity to come up to that daily"
"16506680","16508700"," trigger, right?"
"16508820","16511500"," And be in an upward movement and we're going to bounce. "
"16512300","16513160"," Does that make sense?"
"16514380","16518800"," And if velocity is already up here, it's still moving up."
"16519340","16522560"," So it's still supportive of that daily trigger."
"16523460","16524880"," That's the predictiveness. "
"16530330","16531650"," Does that help or no?"
"16531849","16532430"," Maybe it doesn't."
"16533349","16535250"," And here's where it gets crazier."
"16538660","16540220"," Here's where it gets crazier. "
"16541200","16548200"," When you have multi-time frame velocity coming up from underneath or from above down, it gets even"
"16548200","16550060"," amplified even more."
"16551300","16556140"," So when you get concentrations of this velocity, you get multi-time frames, right?"
"16556380","16560279"," You get the one minute, the five minute, the hour, the daily, the weekly, the monthly."
"16563720","16568540"," You can tell that there's a force coming up from underneath or from above down. "
"16572320","16577580"," You can even predict where we will go depending upon the severity of a crash."
"16578520","16584599"," If you have the tools, go back and look at the 2008 crash, go back and look at the 2001"
"16584599","16588820"," crash, take it all the way back to 1942."
"16590500","16596660"," And you can actually see where the NYA, where the SPX, don't do it spy. "
"16596960","16600419"," Do it like NYA, do it with DIA, DJA, whatever."
"16601240","16603960"," Use like charts going all the way back to the beginning of the stock market."
"16605040","16611700"," And you can actually see, depending upon the severity of an event, where we stop. "
"16612520","16616220"," If we have fraud in the market, where's the expectation for a low?"
"16616939","16620220"," If we have a war, where's the expectation of a low?"
"16620779","16625980"," If we have a normal bear market, where's the expectation of a low?"
"16626300","16628880"," You can actually see it where they tag these lines."
"16632060","16634980"," Consistently, all the way back to the start of the stock market."
"16634980","16644980"," And as a matter of fact, this last time we had a bear market, Mike"
"16644980","16651360"," Wilson was calling for the same targets that the triggers were on. "
"16653080","16655640"," So I'm like, oh, this fucking guy is using the same thing."
"16655820","16659980"," This fucking guy out there is making these targets up with the same shit."
"16661880","16664360"," He's like, I expect this bear market to hit this price. "
"16665520","16667220"," Then he came out and changed the number."
"16667740","16669419"," Then he came out and changed the number again."
"16670820","16672960"," This fucking guy is using the same fucking thing. "
"16674680","16678119"," With structure, like we expected to go here."
"16679099","16680919"," And you're like, why does he expect to go here?"
"16681360","16685240"," Because we haven't figured out there's no fraud, there's no war, there's no this, there's no that."
"16686480","16690439"," If there was a war, if the World War III broke out, I could give you a target. "
"16691040","16691960"," Right here today."
"16692740","16696400"," If World War III broke out today, I could give you a target today."
"16697060","16698980"," And what to expect us to trick the trade. "
"16700279","16702800"," Today, you're going to hit this target right here."
"16704380","16704860"," Guaranteed."
"16705660","16707140"," Or you're going to blow through it. "
"16717290","16720029"," If you have the triggers at home, right?"
"16720610","16721550"," Do yourself a solid."
"16722529","16724390"," Get the New York, get the end."
"16724570","16724810"," What is it called?"
"16725029","16726169"," I always forget it. "
"16726169","16728970"," The New York Composite Index."
"16729509","16730730"," It's called the New York Composite Index."
"16731390","16734529"," It's been around since the first day of this US stock market, I believe. "
"16735330","16737410"," It's the longest thing you can track, I think."
"16738029","16738990"," I could be wrong on that."
"16739710","16741090"," The New York Composite Index. "
"16741950","16743250"," Am I wrong on calling it that?"
"16743610","16744189"," I think it's called that."
"16745529","16746730"," But pull out that chart."
"16747669","16748830"," I want you to look. "
"16749390","16749790"," NYA."
"16750630","16750869"," NYA."
"16752029","16753529"," The ticker symbol is NYA. "
"16753730","16754509"," Pull out the NYA."
"16755450","16757050"," Get your pro trainer."
"16757250","16758110"," Get your triggers out. "
"16758490","16761230"," Go on a daily basis or even a weekly basis."
"16761689","16764390"," I want you to go back to every single stock market crash we had."
"16764830","16769009"," And I want you to, number one, look at the divergences on higher time frame velocity. "
"16769810","16773390"," And then I want you to, number two, see how it starts before the role happens."
"16774189","16775230"," Before the role happens."
"16776070","16779010"," And then I want you to look at where we actually tag. "
"16779730","16782630"," And what was associated with that stock market crash."
"16783650","16785030"," So like, was it COVID?"
"16785370","16786030"," Was it a war?"
"16786630","16787550"," Was it just normal?"
"16788550","16788790"," Right?"
"16788990","16790090"," It was just a normal bear market."
"16790970","16791930"," And where we tagged. "
"16792870","16795030"," And they are all associated with specific triggers."
"16796110","16800110"," And you can, if you have the tool and you look at a daily or weekly basis, I provide you"
"16800110","16804950"," with triggers for the monthly, the quarterly and the six month."
"16809150","16810470"," Good question, by the way. "
"16812750","16813610"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"16813750","16818250"," If you're a pro trainer, get out the NYA chart and start looking."
"16820670","16821490"," It's pretty cool. "
"16824090","16825230"," It's pretty fucking cool."
"16825750","16826790"," And you can say, yeah, that's hindsight."
"16828410","16829710"," You can say it all you want. "
"16830390","16831510"," If you can say it all you want."
"16831850","16832690"," We knew that we were crashing."
"16833110","16833950"," We have, we have it on video. "
"16834890","16835910"," I haven't here on video."
"16836750","16840930"," When I first started streaming, I told people this, start divesting this, start divesting that."
"16841410","16843670"," You could see some squeezing through September to the first. "
"16844190","16845230"," We're rolling over now."
"16845310","16846470"," The market is rolling over."
"16846770","16847630"," We're heading for a crash. "
"16848570","16849470"," I mean, I got it on video."
"16849790","16851250"," I got all this shit on video, so."
"16855630","16857190"," You can predict crashes. "
"16858230","16859210"," Haps to fucking loot."
"16861150","16863710"," If anyone tells you you can't, they don't know what they're talking about."
"16863890","16865630"," Anyone tells you you can't call tops and bottoms. "
"16865830","16867130"," They don't know what they're talking about."
"16867490","16868550"," They're lying to you."
"16868550","16870570"," That's a retailer doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about. "
"16871390","16872770"," 100% every time."
"16873170","16873810"," I promise you that."
"16874250","16875730"," The banks all know when it's going to roll. "
"16876110","16877470"," The banks all know where the bottoms are."
"16877850","16878410"," You didn't know that."
"16879290","16880790"," They're fucking lying to you. "
"16883250","16884930"," They are lying to you."
"16887780","16889780"," They know exactly where bottoms are."
"16889940","16891900"," They know exactly where tops are in this market. "
"16893680","16895320"," They're lying to you in public."
"16906960","16908000"," Isn't that shit crazy?"
"16909140","16909840"," You wait."
"16909980","16910680"," You'll come back and go. "
"16910800","16913060"," These fuckers are lying to me."
"16920350","16921730"," They know all of it."
"16922110","16923690"," It's the biggest scam in the world. "
"16924550","16925150"," It really is."
"16925750","16928010"," It's the biggest fucking fake ass shit in the world."
"16928930","16931670"," What this is going to teach you is something very important. "
"16932650","16934250"," This is your end lesson today."
"16935450","16938750"," I'm going to explain this really important lesson for you today."
"16940470","16950330"," What this is going to teach you is that the stock market is a process of accumulation and"
"16950330","16952170"," distribution in general. "
"16953330","16954950"," You may get something new."
"16955490","16957070"," Like, hey, we got the new shiny rock."
"16957290","16957650"," We got AI. "
"16957890","16958570"," We're going to price that in."
"16959110","16959810"," You might get that."
"16960490","16961610"," You might get fraud. "
"16962930","16963610"," Oh shit."
"16964610","16966850"," They caught Elon with his pants down."
"16967510","16968850"," Having sex with a furry. "
"16971270","16972430"," You might get some fraud."
"16973770","16975750"," That shit's unknown to the market, right?"
"16976330","16978150"," We didn't know the way I was going to do this or that."
"16978510","16987950"," We didn't know that Captain Crunch was having sex with, I don't know, with the fraud, the bear,"
"16988270","16991830"," whatever that is, Captain Crunch was having sex with Count Chocula. "
"16992650","16993250"," We didn't know."
"16994110","16994830"," Right?"
"16995290","16996070"," So that happens."
"16997050","17000330"," But generally speaking, you realize something. "
"17001090","17004630"," Our market is based upon accumulation and distribution."
"17005470","17006190"," That's what it is."
"17006750","17013630"," And if you can track that accumulation and distribution, you have one up on the market. "
"17021580","17022960"," No way, Captain Crunch."
"17027060","17029260"," Now I know our markets are fake."
"17029560","17031400"," I know that price discovery is fake. "
"17031820","17034320"," I know the market can drop on thousand points in a day."
"17034720","17036000"," I realize all that stuff."
"17036760","17039560"," But you will see a systematic approach to the market. "
"17039960","17040920"," And I'm going to tell you one last."
"17041040","17042160"," This is the last thing I'll leave you with."
"17042860","17047820"," None of these fucking computers and none of these fucking algorithms can work. "
"17049100","17049940"," Can work."
"17051620","17058520"," Without a framework for accumulation and distribution."
"17059660","17062140"," They all work on finite math. "
"17062880","17064600"," I know that you'll tell me they don't."
"17065040","17065360"," They do."
"17066760","17071720"," This market, the computers that they use work on a finite. "
"17072780","17079440"," And you knew it can explain this even better is David AMS. Because David AMS gets involved in it"
"17079440","17080600"," too with what he does."
"17081200","17082540"," He watches the same shit. "
"17083740","17089620"," He watches the year time frame, the six month time frame, the quarterly time frame, the monthly"
"17089620","17096220"," time frame, the daily time frame, the daily time frame, right down to the hour."
"17096880","17106480"," When you hear us talking on this stream about the stock market starts at 9.30 in the morning the"
"17106480","17108320"," above above says 4.30 in the afternoon."
"17108740","17112340"," It's because we are counting on different time frames. "
"17112940","17117000"," We're looking at a time frame on a daily basis, an intraday chart by the hour."
"17118180","17118600"," Right?"
"17119020","17123780"," When you scale out a little bit from a one minute chart or a one second chart or a five"
"17123780","17128140"," second chart, you then start looking at time frames by the day, right?"
"17128640","17130240"," You're like, okay, we're going to start looking at by the day."
"17130860","17131280"," Right?"
"17131600","17134140"," So we're going to start looking at by the month, by the week, by the month, whatever you're"
"17134140","17136340"," trading, and you're working on a clock. "
"17137140","17144640"," And that clock on every time frame goes all the way back to the start of the stock market."
"17145640","17152500"," And they've expanded it on different time frames all the way from the start to right where we are"
"17152500","17152940"," right now."
"17153900","17155440"," And you can track it all as it happens. "
"17159160","17162510"," You can track all of it."
"17162510","17167490"," If you can see it, it's not as complicated as you think."
"17178310","17178790"," Okay. "
"17179390","17180730"," Leave that there for now."
"17181250","17182390"," 2.29 in the afternoon."
"17183130","17183990"," Market is pinned. "
"17184150","17184970"," We can see that, right?"
"17185730","17186770"," What else can we see?"
"17187070","17189670"," We've got some volatility coming out tomorrow morning."
"17190510","17193950"," For Thursday, we get some volatility coming out on Friday morning."
"17194710","17196490"," We have a market pin heading into Friday. "
"17197510","17199230"," I'm going to read something to you."
"17199230","17200030"," Give me a few minutes."
"17200030","17201770"," I'm going to talk to you about something. "
"17202430","17203490"," Give me a few minutes."
"17204190","17205970"," I've got some cool for you for the end of the day."
"17207210","17208250"," Give me just a few moments here. "
"17212360","17213380"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"17213800","17214440"," Oh, yeah."
"17214700","17217000"," And I want you to also note here, two points. "
"17217580","17218200"," First point."
"17219080","17225080"," The time frame matters for what you'll see for triggers and for velocity."
"17225740","17230880"," And I'm working on a new version of the tool that will give you the option to put anything you"
"17230880","17232580"," want on it and take whatever you want off. "
"17233080","17234200"," So that'll be coming out soon."
"17234740","17237160"," It's just going to be the same tool, just an update."
"17238260","17239300"," But do that tonight. "
"17239600","17240820"," Just go through the whole market."
"17241480","17248180"," And the most fascinating part is the only time, two times, the only two times this hasn't worked in"
"17248180","17251880"," history is World War II and the Great Depression."
"17252900","17258160"," If we break that last level, we know we are in really fucking bad shit. "
"17258780","17260780"," Tires, burning tires going down the street."
"17261120","17263720"," You can even make a statement."
"17264680","17266860"," We are in tires burning down the street. "
"17267660","17270400"," Because we have two examples of it."
"17276110","17278350"," There is some fractals and fibs in there."
"17278490","17278950"," Yes, there are. "
"17279950","17280810"," Yes, there are."
"17281050","17282010"," It's part of it."
"17282170","17283110"," Not all of it, but part of it. "
"17292690","17296510"," Yeah, you know what we'll do is, what we'll do is, we'll have a, we should do a live stream"
"17296510","17300850"," on a Sunday or something that's private for just like discord people, right?"
"17301070","17305310"," If you're a member, like if you're like a supporter, a pro trainer, we should do a private stream"
"17305310","17306790"," one day and we'll go over it all together."
"17308030","17310590"," And we can ask each other a bunch of questions, a bunch of cool stuff."
"17311630","17313250"," And we'll look at everything together. "
"17313490","17314650"," Next gasoline, April."
"17314650","17315530"," Nothing public."
"17315610","17317210"," Just for us to do it to get a private. "
"17321390","17322150"," So, all right."
"17322410","17324110"," So, give me a few minutes."
"17324170","17324990"," I'm going to go over something. "
"17325190","17325990"," I'm going to talk to you guys."
"17326530","17329010"," It's important stuff for you heading into Friday."
"17339560","17341120"," Do you guys know the history of this stuff?"
"17341240","17342060"," You guys want to know the history?"
"17343240","17345560"," It's like back in the 1970s, right?"
"17346760","17347480"," 9xwti crude. "
"17347660","17348440"," It's a cool shit."
"17348560","17349260"," It's a cool story."
"17349400","17351320"," $9.72 a barrel. "
"17351320","17361120"," That's up $2.16 or 2.78%. So, back in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers started"
"17361120","17365520"," to research AI, believe it or not."
"17366380","17368380"," So, they were researching artificial intelligence."
"17369000","17375380"," And one of the things they were trying to do was try to bridge the gap between people who couldn't"
"17375380","17375980"," communicate. "
"17375980","17380780"," That's what $1.65. Have you guys all know all this stuff or not?"
"17380960","17383140"," But it's like back in the 60s and 70s, right?"
"17383260","17387000"," There's like these researchers and they're like, well, we're like, everything is awesome."
"17387300","17388820"," Hopefully you're going to be able to get computing going on."
"17388940","17389900"," We've got all this cool stuff, right?"
"17390560","17391880"," And so they're like, what's the more we're going to do?"
"17392980","17397800"," We're going to go out there and we're going to try to do something good for society. "
"17398920","17402100"," So, let's say I cannot see."
"17402540","17405200"," Do you want to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleep?"
"17405200","17410960"," They try to do mathematical equations to make neural pathways between someone that can't see and a"
"17410960","17415180"," physical object or someone that can't speak, right?"
"17415520","17417000"," I can't communicate with you."
"17417280","17424560"," They were trying to figure out the math for the neural pathways between something from a person to"
"17424560","17426440"," something that can't have access to. "
"17427120","17432140"," Out of that, there are a bunch of cool ass traders in the stock market."
"17432140","17435860"," And this is how RSI was invented."
"17436520","17441560"," All the free tools that you see out there were like, they had a bunch of stock guys and they"
"17441560","17442920"," wrote a bunch of books about it. "
"17443440","17445520"," The researchers wrote a bunch of books about it."
"17446020","17452800"," And then these stock traders started developing basic tools from the research of that stuff."
"17454580","17460080"," I actually sought some of these guys out about two years ago. "
"17460560","17461680"," Some of them are really old."
"17461840","17464020"," Some of them are like professors that won't even take phone calls."
"17464360","17466420"," But I did seek these guys out. "
"17467300","17473440"," And all of that research has built up to today with the algorithms that are being used in our"
"17473440","17474400"," current system."
"17474820","17475580"," All started."
"17476580","17477660"," I'm trying to get one of the books. "
"17477880","17478760"," I'm going to tell you one of them."
"17478840","17479280"," Hold on a second."
"17479480","17479980"," I think I got one. "
"17480140","17480280"," Hold on."
"17505560","17506320"," Hold on."
"17509140","17510500"," Right here is one guy. "
"17511000","17512220"," You can get this one for yourself."
"17513060","17516920"," This is models of adaptive behavior."
"17517620","17518900"," Models of adaptive behavior. "
"17519580","17520740"," Is that right there?"
"17521580","17523280"," This guy's name is Alice."
"17523360","17527280"," Alice Deere I Houston in John McNamara."
"17528160","17529820"," I read the preface to you. "
"17543200","17548360"," Models of adaptive behavior sets out a framework for explanations of behavior."
"17548360","17551440"," In terms of the maximization of fitness."
"17552660","17559020"," Aspects of an algorithm state such as size, energy reserves, or temperature may be important for"
"17559020","17559920"," survival and reproduction. "
"17562130","17566760"," The framework adopted takes this into account and provides a common currency for comparing diverse"
"17566760","17567380"," actions."
"17567980","17573580"," This approach is used to analyze a wide range of biological issues such as energetic gain, energy"
"17573580","17579400"," predation, trade-offs, dynamic game, state dependent, life histories, and your routines and"
"17579400","17580680"," fluctuating environments."
"17582080","17587580"," In each case, the book summarizes previous work, presents new material, and suggests directions for"
"17587580","17588320"," future research. "
"17588880","17592400"," This book provides a unification in overview of much of the author's previous work on state"
"17592400","17593480"," dependent models."
"17595680","17600060"," Alice Deere Houston is a professor of theoretical biology at the University of Bristol, and John"

"17604560","17607040"," They first met as undergraduates at the University of Oxford. "
"17607760","17609720"," They've been working together since 1978."
"17610660","17612140"," That's when they started that research."
"17612980","17616060"," Developing theoretical approaches to behavior and applying them to various systems. "
"17616920","17622660"," If you find out the papers, they're all public domain now, but if you look back in 1978, when these"
"17622660","17628240"," guys were first working, you can find the white papers that they were releasing on this stuff."
"17639060","17643810"," Yeah, absolutely."
"17646690","17653110"," Well, they first tried to apply all this stuff to helping people, and then market participants were"
"17653110","17657610"," like, well, shit, we need to apply that to the stock market. "
"17662510","17669950"," Okay, so I'm going to read something for you heading into tomorrow, Wednesday, and Saturday."
"17669950","17670910"," I'm going to read a few minutes here."
"17677360","17678520"," There's a few minutes here. "
"17683420","17685720"," Do, do, do, do."
"17686740","17688360"," Give me just a moment here."
"17689320","17691240"," I need a, I need about 10 minutes. "
"17708380","17710700"," Oh, yeah, baby, SPY dividend."

"17922720","17924360"," I don't think I'm not positive."

"17929400","17930500"," I will try to put."
"17930900","17933860"," I'll try to get Scott either to write us a note."
"17934900","17937420"," Or to come on the show, even if it's only briefly. "
"17937820","17940160"," Maybe I can get him on for 10 minutes or something like that tomorrow."
"17941000","17941360"," Today."
"17943140","17944420"," Is Tuesday, right?"
"17945540","17945740"," I think. "
"17948100","17949120"," No, today's Wednesday."
"17949260","17949500"," Shit."
"17950660","17951580"," Hold on a second. "

"17957520","17957800"," I'll see that."
"17958460","17960100"," See if I can get him on the phone here."
"17960200","17960460"," Hold on. "
"17988200","17992100"," Yes, Secretary of State Blinken says there's a strong proposal on the table right now for a"
"17992100","17992360"," ceasefire."
"17992840","17994400"," And the question is whether Hamas will take it."
"18005170","18008670"," Can someone help KCM one thousand five. "
"18106880","18109020"," Give me five minutes of right back with you guys."

"18114380","18115000"," I'll be right back."
"18115400","18116000"," But I am caught."
"18116180","18117840"," I am texting Scott right now. "
"18117880","18118580"," So give me just two minutes."
"18124740","18130460"," How much small donors matter when collectively they're engaged in a campaign?"
"18131120","18131880"," Yeah, that's right."
"18132060","18134860"," And the small dollar donors for Donald Trump at the end of last year. "
"18135000","18136160"," And this is a critical time period."
"18136660","18140520"," We don't know yet what's happened in this year so far because we haven't had the data back up."
"18140540","18144920"," But at the end of last year, Donald Trump was struggling with small dollar donors. "
"18145460","18148760"," Compare to 2019 of the year before the 2020 election."
"18148940","18149520"," It was down significantly."
"18149860","18150740"," We've done reporting on that. "
"18151020","18153500"," So Trump is going to have to do two things at once here."
"18153740","18157380"," One, he's going to have to corral some of these wealthier donors back into the camp."
"18157540","18160460"," I believe he's trying and in some cases may be successful in some cases not. "
"18160760","18164940"," And two, he's going to have to find a way to rebuild that small dollar donor base."
"18165180","18170020"," Something that he just hasn't had in part because some of the money, like we said, is going to"
"18170020","18170900"," paying for his legal bills."
"18170900","18172400"," Quick answer here. "
"18172680","18174440"," What happens next with this TikTok bill?"
"18174600","18175260"," It goes to the Senate."
"18175420","18176080"," What will happen there?"
"18176280","18177920"," And if it passes there, what will the White House do?"
"18178340","18180120"," The White House, I believe, is going to sign this bill."
"18180280","18184160"," If it passes the Senate, I give this a 50-50 shot of passing the Senate at this time. "
"18184380","18185520"," All right, Brian, thanks very much."
"18185680","18187040"," Brian Schwartz, send still ahead."

"18440470","18443450"," Shares are up more than 37% since the start of the year."
"18443870","18449450"," But Piper considers it a high conviction by, why are you so comfortable in those shoes?"
"18449810","18454290"," So we're very comfortable with Crocs is really about newness and innovation."
"18454290","18460610"," And what we're seeing in the consumer is brands that have fresh new product or innovating are"
"18460610","18460850"," winning. "
"18461170","18462990"," They're able to sell for price."
"18463550","18464410"," So less discounting."
"18464810","18465970"," It's better for gross margins. "
"18466690","18470170"," Particularly the Crocs brand is what's leading the charge."
"18470970","18472810"," They've got new product coming."
"18473150","18475590"," They've been outperforming on the sale side. "
"18475890","18476530"," What is the new product?"
"18477370","18478430"," Oh, they're adding height."
"18478850","18483610"," They're adding color, more sandals, but they're still keeping that molded form."
"18483610","18485170"," That we're all familiar with. "
"18486130","18489630"," And importantly, they're growing in Asia, which is part of their growth story."
"18489910","18491630"," India, Southeast Asia and China."
"18492250","18496070"," And importantly, though the stock is up a lot this year, it had a tough time. "
"18496770","18500730"," The Hey Dude acquisition, they had struggled with sales there."
"18501610","18504690"," It finally seems like inventory has been clearing from the channel."
"18505370","18508050"," We are seeing again more newness, more product innovation. "
"18509150","18514110"," They're expanding their sneaker line, their boot line, all under $100."
"18515030","18517630"," And importantly, they never have too many Crocs, right?"
"18517930","18522470"," You can never have too many Crocs or Hey Dudes, especially in a world where it's athleisure and"
"18522470","18523610"," still pretty casual."
"18524550","18530190"," And Hey Dude, again, is doing a better job as well with adding height segmenting the market a"
"18530190","18530750"," little bit better. "
"18531010","18534230"," So for us, it's a stock that's set up to beaten raise."
"18534230","18539850"," The doubters around Hey Dude, I think we'll be surprised come the second half of the year with the"
"18539850","18540810"," new product ramping up."
"18541350","18542670"," I think it sets up to be a winner. "
"18542930","18544490"," Hey Dude, what do you think of Microsoft?"
"18545570","18547230"," So it's funny, I like that."
"18547530","18551390"," So Microsoft, you know, it's been the poster child for AI."
"18551910","18554350"," And I think the thing we'd say is don't sleep on the cloud. "
"18554990","18558470"," It's pretty staggering how big this cloud business is."
"18559110","18562610"," We think Azure can get to about $95 billion into you."
"18563970","18568950"," Microsoft 365, which includes co-pilot, could get to about $50 billion. "
"18569850","18573310"," And in about three years, the entire cloud business can be $200 billion in revenues, which is"
"18573310","18574370"," incredibly high margin."
"18575370","18579450"," The other part, which I think people do sleep on is the non cloud business."
"18579730","18583850"," It's Windows, it's now Activision, and that has very easy comps this year. "
"18584170","18586450"," So what's almost half their business can really accelerate."
"18586870","18589830"," So yes, AI has been the story."
"18590530","18596370"," It's booming, but it's still only 2% of revenues for Microsoft granted growing in a massive rate. "
"18597330","18600270"," But Microsoft to us literally fits the bill."
"18600430","18606030"," It is owning a stock with growth, high returns, cash flow, high yield."
"18606350","18607950"," It's just a terrific setup. "
"18608170","18612010"," You think it's a diversified portfolio in one stock, it sounds like."
"18612270","18613570"," What about Valero energy?"
"18613870","18617530"," Look, this is the only stock, the only energy name on the list."
"18617530","18619990"," So why is it pedal to the metal here?"
"18620590","18624190"," So Valero is the poster child for refining stocks. "
"18624590","18625490"," It is large cap."
"18626310","18627430"," They have the best assets."
"18628090","18629350"," They have the best operators. "
"18630610","18636430"," They are specifically set up to benefit from the strength we're seeing in Gulf Coast."
"18636970","18640050"," Margins, which is really my accrued."
"18640370","18644030"," That gives them an advantage in product costs, which. "
"18644830","18647490"," From input and then, of course, selling it at a higher price."
"18648230","18652950"," And importantly, we see the tightness in the market, which I think investors have been looking to"
"18652950","18655190"," sell against continues to stay tight."
"18655970","18660330"," The supply that's coming on this year, if all of it comes on about a million for barrels of supply"
"18660330","18663170"," in the industry, that barely keeps up with demand. "
"18664010","18666030"," The EV has not killed gasoline demand."
"18666030","18671570"," And the reality is about a million of those million for barrels of supply coming on are high risk"
"18671570","18673610"," in Mexico and as well in Nigeria."
"18674230","18677270"," So if anything, the market's going to stay tighter than people think. "
"18677710","18682190"," This is a cash flow machine that is benefiting from the strength in gasoline."
"18682590","18684230"," You see the stock is taking off today."
"18685830","18687910"," Gasoline drawdown was really strong today. "
"18688470","18692090"," Dislets have a little build counter, but reality is this little margins are leading the whole"
"18692090","18695110"," refinery complex and they are best positioned to benefit from that."
"18695110","18698990"," Let me say we're going to have Jay Glaser when I was getting all my NFL questions ready for you"
"18698990","18699850"," for Jay Glaser."
"18700050","18702690"," A lot of sports, but I'll have similar questions. "
"18702950","18704590"," I'm a different Jay Glaser."
"18704630","18705490"," Different Jay Glaser."
"18705790","18708310"," Jason Glaser is the New York Giants fan. "
"18708490","18709190"," It's tough."
"18709490","18709690"," Sequin."
"18710390","18711090"," That hurt. "
"18711430","18712470"," Sad to see Sequin."
"18712470","18713290"," Thank you, Jason Glaser."
"18714630","18714870"," Thank you. "
"18715070","18715770"," Thank you so much."
"18716010","18722410"," So ahead, the New York Times taking legal action against the world, L-E-T-A-L."
"18722410","18724910"," Again, they're copycats at least. "
"18725190","18726870"," We're going to share details from how it returns."
"18727550","18728390"," And we'll include you."
"18826950","18827810"," All right. "
"18829050","18830190"," I'm finally back."
"18831190","18832150"," Gather round, gang."
"18834970","18836090"," Gather round. "
"18837070","18838710"," Come around the fireside here."
"18838850","18840190"," We got a problem here too."
"18840390","18842950"," Not a problem, but this is going to. "
"18846470","18847770"," I got something for you."
"18849370","18850930"," Let me grab the people in the discord."
"18876700","18878260"," Go call your friends out there. "
"18880740","18881460"," Go out there."
"18881620","18881820"," Go out."
"18881960","18884060"," Go tell your friends to show up, whatever you're going to do. "
"18884880","18885980"," Get on Finn to it."
"18886100","18889020"," Find your best friend and be like, here come watch this show for 15 minutes."
"18889220","18889360"," Okay. "

"18893720","18894980"," Get rid of that one right there."
"18895640","18896640"," Or maybe you don't. "
"18896740","18897120"," Maybe you want to."
"18897120","18897460"," I don't know."
"18897580","18898020"," Maybe you want to. "
"18899740","18901420"," Maybe you want to be like, nah, nah, nah, nah."
"18901580","18902400"," We ain't telling them, my friends."
"18902540","18903180"," I don't like those guys. "
"18903700","18905600"," They like them on Finn, Twit, Wall Street Bets."
"18905740","18907520"," I like them on Stock Twits, but I don't like them here."
"18908560","18910380"," I got some fascinating shit for you. "
"18910980","18911300"," Now."
"18915140","18916460"," I'm going to turn this shit off."
"18917520","18917840"," Okay. "
"18919280","18920660"," So I got some stuff for you here."
"18923600","18924040"," Okay."
"18928020","18929580"," Watch how we're weak right now. "
"18929660","18930240"," Let me get rid of all this."
"18930500","18933120"," Get rid of all that right there for an important reason."
"18935200","18936660"," We're going to switch over here. "
"18936720","18937780"," It's 4 p.m. Okay."
"18939360","18941020"," Gather around the fireside chat."
"18944260","18947080"," Now, I'm going to preface what I'm going to say to you here. "
"18949500","18950880"," I'm going to preface this."
"18951880","18954700"," That this is not financial advice."
"18956280","18958640"," But I want to preface something to you here. "
"18958820","18958960"," Okay."
"18959180","18960780"," This is just observations."
"18962880","18963840"," From Scott's. "
"18963860","18964060"," Okay."
"18964300","18968000"," So we're going to talk about it right now in the post that I made to you in the Discord."
"18969220","18976700"," Into the financial times. "
"18976700","18976860"," Okay."
"18977500","18978940"," Note this right now."
"18979180","18979240"," Okay. "
"18979460","18979840"," Note the doom."
"18980780","18981480"," All right."
"18982460","18983660"," Note the doom. "
"18985300","18986200"," Into the close."
"18986540","18986580"," Right."
"18986700","18987780"," It's a two fifty nine. "
"18987900","18988480"," We got an hour left."
"18988700","18988760"," Right."
"18989380","18992340"," I'm going to predict that we go down into the close today. "
"18993660","18994880"," I'm going to predict that."
"18995120","18996640"," I'm going to explain it to you right now."
"18996640","18997040"," Why?"
"18997740","18999160"," Are you guys ready for it?"
"19000380","19001200"," Gather around. "
"19003780","19005600"," Now, even though I'm predicting it."
"19007160","19008320"," Is it doom and gloom?"
"19011760","19013580"," I want you to listen closely here."
"19013720","19013920"," Okay. "
"19014600","19015320"," Until I'm done."
"19016820","19018880"," So we got some weakness here in the close."
"19022080","19024020"," I'm going to read a note to you right now. "
"19025880","19026980"," This is from Scott."
"19028300","19030300"," He is a part of the trade the trigger network."
"19031560","19033320"," It's not it's not in stone. "
"19033540","19034980"," But he has been since the beginning."
"19035880","19037160"," He writes here."
"19038740","19039460"," Lastly. "
"19041060","19042080"," Look out."
"19042840","19044900"," For opx Thursday."
"19046000","19047440"," And spy ex div. "
"19048220","19051760"," It is notorious in the div capture trade spurred demand."
"19052560","19055080"," For spy Thursday expiration calls."
"19056280","19057620"," That's a zero date call. "
"19058400","19059420"," If you don't know what that is."
"19060080","19066960"," To rest spy from unsuspecting overwriters and collect the dividend."
"19070200","19071480"," What does that mean?"
"19073260","19075040"," Well, it means this right here. "
"19077700","19080280"," This right here is the Wednesday close."
"19082460","19086360"," Do you see the push up can't get where you want to go?"
"19086860","19088440"," And they push us down."
"19089440","19091260"," Let me show you this in a better way here. "
"19091340","19091540"," Hold on."
"19091660","19092140"," Watch this closely."
"19092420","19092600"," Okay. "
"19093460","19094680"," I'm going to bring this closer."
"19095460","19097220"," We're going to zoom in and look at it."
"19097360","19097860"," You see it?"
"19100040","19101980"," Then we have that blood down on the clothes. "
"19102220","19103280"," See the blood down on the clothes."
"19103580","19104240"," We couldn't get up."
"19104480","19105320"," We thought we were going up. "
"19105420","19105640"," We didn't."
"19105700","19109340"," Did we start heading down into the close Wednesday close right here?"
"19110880","19115440"," And they rest control of the market."
"19116100","19117240"," At the open. "
"19118100","19119380"," On Thursday."
"19120940","19125340"," With a high volume of call buying on zero dates."
"19125980","19127440"," And what they do. "
"19129400","19132840"," Is they rip the fucking market to the moon."
"19134200","19137060"," Ex div Thursday ramp."
"19138520","19144140"," And they take all the dividends away from unsuspecting call riders. "
"19144140","19144580"," Right."
"19146100","19148380"," And then they dump the fuck out of it."
"19149120","19150220"," Into Friday. "
"19150620","19150980"," Op X."
"19152920","19156700"," Now there's no guarantee that this is going to happen again."
"19157880","19159020"," No guarantee."
"19160120","19162260"," But look at that series of new lows. "
"19162260","19162680"," Right."
"19162860","19164480"," A little bit of this going on right here."
"19165500","19168660"," And we're going to switch over right now and take a look. "
"19169620","19170220"," At."
"19170900","19171500"," Gamma."
"19172260","19174660"," Matter of fact, we're going to go back to a different gamma chart. "
"19175860","19176380"," We've got."
"19179680","19181460"," Our screener right here with."
"19181820","19185220"," Where is the concentration of call and put gamma. "
"19185760","19186820"," It is on."
"19187840","19188780"," Fifty two hundred."
"19190640","19191160"," Right. "
"19191420","19192100"," Fifty two hundred."
"19194840","19196780"," Fifty two hundred, right."
"19197760","19199960"," And then we're going to go to the other screener over here. "
"19199960","19201320"," We're going to look here at gamma."
"19203260","19205040"," And here's support right here."
"19206180","19209720"," So if you wanted to capture the div on spy. "
"19210240","19212520"," Spoons SPX whatever spy though."
"19212660","19212780"," Right."
"19213100","19213900"," That's a P 500. "
"19214720","19217380"," And if they sell us down into this close."
"19222180","19226440"," There might be an expectation that you buy that close."
"19227440","19230180"," And they fucking run the fuck out of it. "
"19230180","19232080"," And then we're going to look at tomorrow way up here."
"19235200","19241700"," And then when we close on, or we close this and on Friday, come back down for op X on"
"19241700","19242080"," Friday."
"19242560","19243380"," Today is Wednesday. "
"19247780","19248340"," So."
"19249820","19251880"," Does this trade work out?"
"19254100","19255180"," You see it there?"
"19255400","19255580"," Hold on."
"19255640","19256660"," I'll show it to you one more time. "
"19258460","19260300"," You want to see it for yourself?"
"19261380","19262180"," Right there."
"19263700","19264640"," Wednesday close."
"19265800","19267000"," X div Thursday ramp. "
"19268380","19269420"," Friday bloodbath."
"19278400","19279520"," Pretty simple right."
"19280320","19282040"," Does it mean it's going to happen right now?"
"19282720","19283080"," No. "
"19283720","19285320"," If too many people know about it."
"19285780","19287200"," Does it mean it's going to happen again?"
"19287760","19287980"," No."
"19288700","19290400"," Is there a fair chance that it doesn't work?"
"19290400","19291000"," Yes. "
"19291640","19293580"," But they do it a lot."
"19294860","19297960"," We know that there's a gamma bar above at where?"
"19298700","19300480"," 5200 and SPX."
"19302060","19306860"," So if they were going to run that bullshit program again, what would you expect to happen?"
"19307720","19310820"," Between three PM right now and four PM. "
"19312340","19317240"," You would expect the market to sell down into this close."
"19317740","19318580"," And what do we have here?"
"19319360","19320720"," We got a bear plane."
"19321560","19322960"," It doesn't mean we're going down. "
"19323120","19324020"," We could squeeze up here."
"19324360","19327780"," But what if we do blast down into this close?"
"19329260","19336620"," Only for a giant fucking rip in your becoming the whole at the close."
"19339520","19343080"," So let's watch this right now into the close today. "
"19345320","19346500"," Let's see what happens."
"19347380","19350360"," Do we get selling into the bell?"
"19351820","19356720"," And if we do, do we get an insane ramp tomorrow?"
"19359560","19364660"," I mean, I'd love to see what some of these OTM calls are going to go for tomorrow."
"19365260","19366060"," Wouldn't you?"
"19371170","19373150"," How's that making you feel right there?"
"19373310","19374790"," Is that making you feel saucy out there?"
"19374930","19375590"," Let me know in the chat. "
"19375790","19377190"," I don't see anybody chatting right now."
"19378310","19381570"," Are you all at home right now with your hands and stuff like that?"
"19381730","19382510"," Are y'all freaking out?"
"19385370","19386750"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"19386750","19388190"," Give me that wet and saucy. "
"19390530","19391910"," You're not going to tell your friends."
"19391910","19393470"," Are you three o'clock in the afternoon?"
"19393470","19394450"," You're not going to tell your friends."
"19395230","19395670"," Ooh. "
"19396410","19397230"," Then sign up."
"19397630","19398070"," Ooh."
"19398490","19401430"," Or financial use approach for years worth faster. "
"19401830","19403310"," So what do we want to see into this close?"
"19403310","19405310"," And say weakness, right?"
"19411700","19413740"," You want to see weakness, don't you?"
"19414480","19418580"," Oh, there is a big gambar 5150, but it's not the biggest gambar."
"19418920","19420420"," You are, you are, no, no."
"19420880","19423200"," You're incorrect with the expiry on Friday. "
"19424020","19424520"," 5200."
"19425280","19426560"," We lose half of that gamma."
"19427320","19429220"," Not you're, you're mixing up. "
"19430120","19433000"," Expiring contracts and expiring gamma."
"19435780","19437900"," Expiring contracts and expiring gamma."
"19438120","19438580"," Two different things. "
"19443690","19447170"," So hopefully we get some doom here into the close, right?"
"19449490","19450070"," Doom."
"19451490","19453770"," And what are we trying to do with the close?"
"19455510","19456650"," Buy the fuck out of it."
"19463260","19466880"," So this is not financial advice at all. "
"19466880","19469740"," You should not at any way follow this trade."
"19470340","19475920"," But I want you to be aware of the observations made in prior op-exes."
"19480220","19485540"," If you want to get into the discord, if you want access to the market briefs that come out every"
"19485540","19491540"," night, if you want access to the pro updates, if you want access to any of the tools, you want"
"19491540","19497840"," to go to the website www.tradethetrigger.com and you sign up there. "
"19498720","19500440"," That should answer the question for you."
"19500780","19501820"," Tradethetrigger.com."
"19509490","19510850"," It's not a buy zone."
"19512450","19513850"," That's not what you're looking for. "
"19513990","19520150"," You're looking for a murder bot into the close and you buy that fucking close."
"19520150","19521850"," Not, not, I shouldn't say that."
"19522330","19523550"," You shouldn't buy that close. "
"19527070","19528670"," Do you want to see where it is?"
"19528830","19529590"," No, I'll show it to you."
"19530930","19532170"," I'll show you where it is."
"19534190","19535310"," Oh, it was here earlier. "
"19536130","19536990"," I got rid of it."
"19539310","19545250"," First target down below, 5.15.66. Second target down below."
"19546890","19550010"," This is where Captain Jim James used car lot is. "
"19552570","19554750"," Captain Jim James used car lot."
"19559210","19561310"," Oh yeah, there it is right there, isn't it?"
"19561630","19564090"," Captain Jim James used car lot."
"19564170","19564730"," Do you want to see it?"
"19565970","19566770"," I'll go over to it. "
"19573460","19580060"," There is the card prices on the grey trigger, the half hour trigger."
"19582780","19588800"," If this pans out, I want to see PT1 right there."
"19596610","19598310"," This is it, this is at 430. "
"19600830","19603150"," Here's PT2 if you can get the real blood going."
"19604690","19605290"," PT2."
"19610510","19614470"," When there is a difference between gamma and expiring contracts. "
"19615190","19625790"," So if we were going to pin 5200 or the expectation of a pin there into op-x, we'd"
"19625790","19631690"," want to get this price as low as possible into the close so that we can ramp a Thursday ramp"
"19631690","19633010"," to the moon."
"19635810","19644350"," If this thesis is in any way shape or form correct, whatever that closing price is, you would buy"
"19644350","19645270"," the fuck out of it."
"19645910","19652510"," Between 4 p.m. and 4.15. Now this is all theoretical, there is no guarantee that this happens, but"
"19652510","19656650"," I just showed you the history of it happening. "
"19660520","19665100"," Now I don't know if they're going to change it up, I don't know if this one time they're going"
"19665100","19675050"," to tell you, surprise it didn't happen, but I'll tell you what,"
"19677270","19682230"," there's probably a lot of people out there that know about the history of it happening."
"19690780","19693580"," You can show me whatever you like, I just showed you what I got."
"19693820","19698360"," So you show me what you got, post anywhere you want, and I'll read it, post in the discord. "
"19700720","19707320"," So my thought here, my thought here, is that our week is fucking to the close, but you're going to"
"19707320","19710160"," wake up tomorrow at 4 p.m. and be fucking mooning."
"19711740","19718720"," If you pull back from a one minute chart, if you pull back yourself from a one minute chart and"
"19718720","19724220"," you look on bigger candles, here it is right here."
"19725260","19735560"," Come down into the Wednesday close, next give pump, to capture the dividend, and"
"19735560","19738060"," they dump the fuck out of it down into Friday. "
"19740600","19743180"," So I guess we got poison for everybody here, right?"
"19743360","19748520"," We got some doom and gloom into the close today, we got a face ripper, and then we got a"
"19748520","19749840"," fucking doom and gloom into Friday."
"19750740","19752040"," Now does it mean it's going to happen this time?"
"19752040","19753120"," Nope, no guarantees."
"19754200","19756040"," I'm going to tell you what I'm going to be trading though. "
"19759940","19769560"," I can tell you what price action is right now, and that is down into the close, a fucking face"
"19769560","19776970"," ripper tomorrow, and then sell the news on Friday, baby."
"19783810","19785710"," Let's see what happens in the next hour."
"19792250","19796570"," Do not pay attention to the news in the next few days. "
"19807180","19813220"," This is a, this is a, this is, this is likely a hedge fund or two with some money."
"19814440","19819940"," People that own the spy, people trying to pull a fast one on the market."
"19822440","19823780"," This is manipulation. "
"19827370","19831770"," These are probably the same people that tell you, fuck all those zero-date traders in retail, that"
"19831770","19833310"," they're doing the same shit in size."
"19840460","19842240"," Chase, stop talking, man."
"19842700","19844820"," Seriously, don't fuck with this vibe, brother. "
"19845480","19847380"," Come back and mess with me and pride if I'm wrong."
"19862710","19868590"," Yeah, stop hitting the buy button for like an hour, and then we'll hit the buy button at 4 p "
"19868590","19877900",".m. No, this is like a, this is like a trap for a call writer, or for"
"19877900","19880440"," call writers."
"19882700","19883640"," That's the call writer. "
"19883760","19885960"," This is a trap to collect the dividends on the underlying."
"19886640","19890780"," And then they ramp it up, they get the dividend, and then they sell the fuck out of everything."
"19891620","19895320"," And they trap these fuckers with no dividend into Friday. "
"19897860","19899900"," It's pretty gnarly, to be honest."
"19903060","19904420"," It's pretty fucking gnarly."
"19905100","19906240"," I don't know if that's going to happen. "
"19907040","19908260"," I'm not guaranteeing it."
"19908600","19910820"," And this is most certainly, do not trade it."
"19911400","19913200"," Listen to me closely, do not trade this. "
"19913920","19916140"," Do not follow me on this trade, please."
"19922000","19925700"," If any of you want to go to Wall Street butts and get people over here, I'll go over it"
"19925700","19926460"," one more time."
"19928020","19930140"," If you want me to go over it one more time, I will. "
"19952810","19953390"," I'll wait."
"19955790","19956890"," We can do it again."
"19960980","19962820"," We get the Wall Street betters in on. "
"19962940","19963640"," I shouldn't say that."
"19963840","19964800"," That's some bad shit."
"19965520","19966480"," Wall Street bets. "
"19966900","19967880"," I shouldn't have said that."
"19968200","19970000"," I'll wait for Wall Street betters to show up."
"19974020","19975020"," That's never good. "
"19975680","19976640"," You do that shit."
"19976820","19977800"," No fucking all up."
"19981940","19986520"," Remember, we're trying to sneak into the pockets of fat old rich white guys. "
"19987100","19989100"," We don't want everybody piling in there."
"20000760","20009090"," Just keep between you and I."
"20009090","20013730"," Don't come back on tomorrow and go, Captain, why did you say this was going to happen and it"
"20013730","20014230"," didn't?"
"20015770","20016490"," Remember that."
"20016630","20018070"," Don't come back to me and say anything. "
"20019810","20021290"," I don't want to hear shit if it doesn't happen."
"20021750","20022710"," I'm definitely taking the trade."
"20022970","20025570"," So if you guys want to know I am taking that trade of clothes. "
"20028610","20029450"," Well, not definitely."
"20029990","20032950"," If we were to start screaming up into the bell, I might not take it."
"20033570","20036210"," But if we don't, we start bloodening it down into this bell. "
"20037250","20039210"," That's some convincing shit enough for me."
"20040430","20041430"," So let's see what happens."
"20046750","20048910"," It happens every op X."
"20054690","20055650"," What's going on everybody?"
"20057890","20058370"," Okay. "
"20058650","20059130"," Just got the lake."
"20059790","20062290"," I'll be going to go through this one more time for you."
"20064070","20065010"," One more time. "
"20066610","20067890"," We'll go over it one more time."
"20069410","20075830"," As a matter of fact, when I'm done, I'm going to end the stream early today."
"20076650","20076970"," Okay. "
"20077270","20078850"," So this is your one chance right here."
"20078870","20079070"," Okay."
"20079150","20079310"," You ready?"
"20079750","20080770"," I want to take a bright sunny outside. "
"20081310","20082630"," Plus I got some construction guys here."
"20083210","20085550"," So I got to go look at the, I got to go talk to these construction guys."
"20085970","20086450"," They are there. "
"20086710","20092250"," I got a bunch of houses I'm trying to get rid of."
"20092250","20095510"," I'm going to fix this fix that shit and put it on market."
"20095790","20095870"," So. "
"20097410","20097890"," Okay."
"20098850","20099770"," Here we go."
"20100310","20101630"," We're going to do it one more time. "
"20102570","20104070"," Gather around the fireplace."
"20104730","20105690"," Gather on the fire pick."
"20108910","20113650"," Now this is, I want to preface this with this is not financial advice. "
"20113990","20115510"," You will blow up your account doing this shit."
"20115690","20116970"," Do not follow this trade."
"20118490","20118970"," Okay. "
"20119730","20120370"," Now."
"20122430","20123530"," What do I got here?"
"20123710","20124170"," Hold on a second."
"20127560","20128200"," Whoa. "
"20128880","20129260"," Easy."
"20139110","20141170"," The last few quarters."
"20142450","20144650"," This trade has been going bananas. "
"20147150","20147790"," Bananas."
"20149110","20154710"," The call volume is exploded and has been driving at spy SPX through the roof on these Thursdays."
"20155850","20157050"," Here is September. "
"20157370","20160390"," The Fed meeting wasn't quite quarterly Op-Op-X week, right?"
"20160810","20162270"," Now above this is the statement."
"20166510","20171490"," People look out for Op-X Thursday in spy X dividend."
"20172190","20179490"," It is notorious and the div capture trades spurred demand for spy Thursday expiration calls to rest"
"20179490","20184130"," spy from unsuspecting over riders and collect the dividend. "
"20185650","20185850"," Okay."
"20186070","20188310"," And then they dump it after on Friday."
"20189690","20192890"," So if we look at a prior example, here it is. "
"20194850","20198430"," And what happens is, remember today we've had two examples so far."
"20198970","20201070"," We couldn't get above today, could we?"
"20203710","20206610"," We are a little bit weak into the clothes today, aren't we?"
"20206610","20216610"," And then the last bit, the last bit of that clothes, they do a ramp for"
"20216610","20217770"," X div Thursday."
"20218150","20218850"," See it right there?"
"20221710","20231610"," And then if this happens, you would sell Thursday clothes, get some puts, and ride"
"20231610","20232870"," this thing back down. "
"20232870","20237270"," Now it might not be this large because of where we are in positioning."
"20238390","20243950"," But I want to next draw your attention to gamma."
"20244770","20247030"," Not contracts expiring, gamma. "
"20248290","20250310"," And we're a little weak right now, aren't we?"
"20251130","20254650"," See how weak we are in this clothes on spy, you see it as PX at least."
"20255930","20259610"," Get a little bit of a rip here, a little bit of a rip right here, but what's above us?"
"20261790","20262630"," PT3."
"20263430","20270590"," We also have a large concentration of gamma, not at 5150. "
"20271290","20280970"," We have it at 5200 right here, 5200, 218 "
"20280970","20284290",".34. And about half of it rolls off on Friday."
"20286130","20291650"," So if we go back to the bottom right hand side screen over here, there is potential for weakness"
"20291650","20297890"," into the end of the day today from historical example, not guaranteed."
"20298850","20303430"," And then you'd see some kind of stupid ass rip on Thursday. "
"20305510","20308390"," And then come right back down into Friday."
"20309450","20313790"," Makes sense, even if it only comes up to like right here, let's say."
"20313790","20318930"," And then comes back down on Friday down here at your 5150. "
"20320170","20321690"," Hold on, let me get here to that."
"20322430","20323150"," So here we go."
"20327260","20333570"," Here's 5150 for Friday. "
"20334770","20338530"," And what the points here would be that you'd get this rip."
"20339710","20343690"," Like you get the clothes, they rip the fuck out of Thursday."
"20344130","20346950"," And then we blood Friday all the way down here. "
"20353390","20357310"," But remember, this 5200 up here is the target for tomorrow."
"20357670","20358690"," I don't know if we hit it."
"20359470","20360750"," I don't know if we don't. "
"20360770","20362590"," We've come pretty close here over here, haven't we?"
"20364910","20366390"," We've already done it once before."
"20369410","20370330"," So what do you get?"
"20370510","20371750"," Do you get the failure up here?"
"20372290","20373050"," Hold on a second here."
"20383650","20385090"," No guarantee this happens. "
"20385650","20387210"," Let's turn it up though for tomorrow."
"20389130","20390510"," Yeah, we'll just leave that yellow."
"20394470","20395850"," And we'll make this one red. "
"20396890","20398550"," Theoretically, we could go right about here, right?"
"20399290","20399750"," Not guaranteed."
"20400850","20402910"," Let's see if it plays out because it might not."
"20403590","20404770"," But it's been working, right?"
"20405690","20415670"," I bet you there's a bunch of cocaine, uh, male jiggle-o using, uh, fun guys out there that"
"20415670","20424470"," are probably betting on a trade like this into Thursday and then a trade down like that in a"
"20424470","20424810"," Friday. "
"20429360","20430380"," Make sense?"
"20435230","20437050"," Not financial advice."
"20441090","20450240"," But there's a pattern of repetitive behavior by some very, very bad, bad big money boys out there."
"20451900","20453940"," Trying to steal that X div. "
"20455780","20458100"," They want that money, don't they?"
"20461700","20463380"," They want that arbitrage."
"20464260","20466460"," Blame you as a retail trader for it happening."
"20467720","20468420"," Don't they?"
"20472680","20475160"," No, this applies to fucking banks and hedge funds. "
"20476220","20477180"," That's what it applies to."
"20478100","20480080"," It does not apply to zero-date mania."
"20480080","20480780"," I guess it could if it's men. "
"20497730","20505730"," Hypothetically, you're going to be, you're going to be, uh, looking for a bounce on PT-1 before we"
"20505730","20506330"," get to the bell."
"20509390","20513190"," Or a bounce on PT-2 right here."
"20514910","20518850"," Before we ever get to the bell and you're going to along the, or even the bell and we're going"
"20518850","20520150"," to along the fuck out of tomorrow. "
"20521310","20523770"," Let's take a look at some of the, some of the trades for tomorrow."
"20524550","20525590"," What are we doing right now?"
"20525710","20526270"," We bloodin' it?"
"20528250","20528610"," Interesting."
"20545550","20546270"," Holy shit. "
"20546830","20548490"," I was, I was trading the 15th."
"20550190","20553370"," I thought I was trading the 13th today."
"20557250","20559270"," So now I'm looking at March 14th. "
"20559750","20560430"," I got to get new glasses."
"20564530","20567370"," So March 14th."
"20576410","20578570"," Boy, those 520 calls, man. "
"20578710","20580350"," They're only 23 cents right now."
"20580990","20581430"," Whoo!"
"20582430","20583790"," 23 cents."
"20585030","20587030"," And here's another caveat about this trade. "
"20588830","20593410"," You get massive, massive volume on this trade."
"20594790","20598250"," You know what that brings, right?"
"20598990","20599870"," Brings premium."
"20608470","20610190"," Now I don't know if this trade's going to work. "
"20610370","20611310"," I don't know what it means."
"20611410","20612530"," I don't know anything."
"20617190","20623210"," Don't come back tomorrow if it doesn't work and say, that fucking Captain Jim James roped me into a"
"20623210","20624110"," trade and I got burned. "
"20627070","20629050"," But for me, I'm watching this close."
"20629390","20634530"," And if we're, if we're kind of bearish here, I'm going to probably try to take this trade."
"20635830","20637970"," So I'm going to watch this into the close here. "
"20641470","20644310"," If you got something better, post it."
"20675020","20676200"," I can't look at it."
"20676240","20676700"," I got to be honest. "
"20676880","20678100"," I can't look at anything right now."
"20678920","20681080"," I'm fucking focused on this trade here."
"20682740","20687060"," I want to look at stuff for you, but I can't. "
"20687060","20688160"," Yeah, G dot gold."
"20688160","20689420"," That's a good advice right there."
"20689440","20690240"," He says paper traded. "
