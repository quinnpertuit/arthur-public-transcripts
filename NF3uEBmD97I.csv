"157500","158860"," Just switch out of this here. "
"186560","188680"," We'll get book map rolling here for you this morning."
"193260","196020"," So, what should be expected this morning is we have this bounce, right?"
"198140","209420"," We've got a cash back this morning, a gap fell down at 4.51.19. And"
"209420","212200"," we did a late night night cap presentation."
"214640","222780"," So, on that presentation, we talked about traditionally charting out a graph on the spy and key,"
"222900","223500"," whatever you like. "
"229880","232800"," Hey, Tiptel, are going to load this up."
"243190","244350"," Hey, good morning, everybody."
"245350","247390"," Good morning, low F4. "
"248150","249130"," Good morning, where are your room?"
"251290","252930"," How did I have the wrong date and the title?"
"257829","258450"," Oh, you know what?"
"258510","260329"," I should have switched that to the 20th."
"261470","261990"," Dang it."
"263030","264930"," Thanks for catching that this morning. "
"265690","266430"," Good morning, Ben."
"267290","268290"," Good morning, Adam."
"269550","270310"," Hey, V for me. "

"274630","276310"," Good morning, JV."
"276470","279290"," Good morning, Steven, Bill."
"279470","280030"," Good to see you, brother. "
"281590","283590"," Zio, good morning, Philip."
"286190","286930"," You know what?"
"287010","290170"," I'll put those support and resistance levels out right now."
"290990","299210"," But I'm going to let you know that they probably do not matter at this point. "
"300830","307830"," You're going to want to traditionally chart I wouldn't even charge support levels traditionally"
"307830","308570"," right now."
"308730","312490"," We've got some price targets, I guess, and we're going to be looking for a turn as well."
"312930","314810"," I'll post those to you, though, in a few moments. "
"316130","317870"," Updated support and resistance levels."
"320390","321630"," I'll get on that right now."
"321630","326450"," I'll have that done the first 10 minutes or so, but I do want you to realize that this is"
"326450","327950"," still a solid market type situation. "
"330870","333610"," I'll chart this out on Spy and post it as well."
"333610","335290"," I posted it out on ES last night."
"338450","347770"," I'll at least chart out how to be trading the Spy today, looking for major resistance levels to"
"347770","349710"," sell this market, to be honest with you. "
"351750","352910"," I don't know if it is."
"353050","354450"," Does anyone out there bullish this morning?"
"359670","360150"," Beerheads."
"368420","373280"," Give me just about a few minutes here, and I'm going to pump out some support and resistance"
"373280","373820"," levels. "
"374420","375780"," That's how many guys rely upon them."
"375860","377520"," I did forget to put those out last night."
"378180","379240"," Give me just a second. "
"382860","383940"," Shouldn't take but a minute."
"396300","405660"," I wouldn't be relying so much upon support and resistance levels, rather than,"
"405660","414440"," there is a gnarly web of resistance here for the Spy."
"415600","423240"," Same goes for NQ and on here. "
"426600","427580"," That's PX."
"429660","431440"," Same goes for NQ and IWM."
"435090","437670"," I'm just thinking about putting this stuff out for you right now. "
"445040","447420"," Let me know in the chat if you think we're going up."
"447860","450560"," Let me know if you think we're going to start selling off immediately off the bell."
"452700","457180"," Let me know if you think we're going to trade sideways because it's not a no PX day. "
"458400","460860"," Let me know if you think we trade sideways then soft end of the day."
"461140","465600"," Let me know if you think we're going to be super uber bullish, and if you do think we're going"
"465600","467620"," to be super uber bullish, how high do you think we're going?"
"481660","486880"," And we do have some, I think at 10 or 11, we've got some oil numbers coming out."
"487460","494400"," Oil, it looks like XLE came down this morning and it should continue to come down as well. "
"494660","498660"," If you feel like you're going to throw up or something short in the market, you could always short"
"498660","510310"," energy just a"
"510310","511110"," second here."
"512250","512830"," Almost done."
"548860","557280"," I do wonder if what the implications on energy or net gas on, if we go to war with Ukraine,"
"559100","563660"," I don't think you can get, hold on here, get some walking that's going on. "
"564540","569910"," I have going on here, having some issues with."
"589210","590110"," Yeah, let me know."
"590250","591230"," I want to know what you guys think. "
"594800","597620"," We talked last night as well about what to look for."
"598180","614040"," If we do get a real recovery, what a V-shaped recovery looks like and also what I"
"614040","618060"," think they're called crown type recoveries, what those look like."
"628940","632620"," So if you're our bullish this morning, you're just looking for a couple of different signs that"
"632620","633000"," were bullish. "
"639050","646030"," They're not too difficult to figure out once you know what to look for."
"646750","647570"," Let's see here."
"650050","650970"," All right. "
"660370","661270"," Copy the link."
"667290","668210"," It's not too bad."
"668210","669570"," Don't do me six minutes this morning. "
"685550","687090"," You guys are coming to rely upon those things."
"687250","687850"," I kind of like it."
"690650","691190"," All right. "
"691370","700230"," So the resistance and support levels, key pivots are now posted on Twitter in the nick of time."
"700770","701290"," All right."
"701290","705550"," So I'm going to show you guys to see what you guys think about this morning. "
"707090","708690"," Let's start at the top here."
"709470","711310"," So you guys think sideways is up today."
"711630","712290"," Say we puke. "
"714190","716110"," So Chris, you're thinking that we puke upwards."
"717350","718810"," See you guys are posting here."
"721470","722330"," Good morning, everybody. "
"722550","722990"," Good morning, Jay."
"723250","723970"," Good morning, you mama."
"727290","728850"," Discord link is down in the description. "
"733790","735550"," Job support is not great this morning."
"740400","742860"," Yeah, we nailed the spy and Q in the rut."
"744140","745720"," You're along the NQs. "
"745900","746800"," Hard to be bull right now."
"746960","748300"," Yeah, it's hard to be a bull right now, I agree."
"751840","754120"," The Euroburn boomer, I like what you're saying out there. "
"754300","755700"," I'm bullish to reload some puts."
"756280","757120"," I will say this one thing."
"757440","767060"," If you're a bear out there, you definitely want to be seeing some sort of a, you'll make money off"
"767060","769120"," the bell if we trade, start trading down immediately. "
"770020","774500"," But the bull, the bear is of course, they want it to rip higher so that they can get a"
"774500","777760"," firm rejection and get a nice shot straight down right now."
"778820","780520"," So you kind of let the finger off, right?"
"781300","787520"," Let the bulls feel like they're going somewhere and only to sell them out, right?"
"787880","789140"," Because we already know."
"789520","793260"," I can tell you, I can tell you, for surely tell you right now that no bank, no bull, no"
"793260","795020"," retail guy thinks that we're going high. "
"795320","797080"," No one thinks we're going to 480 right now."
"797640","801500"," So the bears want another chance to reject."
"804480","807240"," Eric Rapers forever to Tesla FOMO bull here. "
"807560","809060"," I respect that, I understand that."
"812060","814500"," Yeah, we have to look up, we have to look off the open."
"814520","820720"," If the volume is low off the open, we're going to look for sellers above here. "
"821060","827800"," You can see right now, sellers showing up at this moment at 475.68. We'd never shock me that we"
"827800","828760"," trade that high either."
"829480","830740"," So I'm always open to that."
"830820","832060"," I don't think that we do this morning. "
"832500","834720"," We'll know off the bell where the sellers are hiding."
"835360","839040"," Should be pretty easy to see where they are, where the resistance will be."
"839420","841920"," So we'll be paying attention to that the moment that the market opens. "
"842180","843300"," We'll check the queues as well."
"844000","844700"," We'll check the queues."
"844700","845700"," We'll check spy. "
"846000","846800"," We'll check IWM."
"848480","851960"," Matter of fact, I'll pump those in right away so that we can look."
"852640","855180"," And look for some targeted opportunities today. "
"862280","864980"," All right, we'll get these loaded up now so that we're ready."
"889720","894000"," What do I think about the $18.8 billion notional exposure?"
"894600","896560"," 40-400 calls for $211."
"897820","901540"," Hasn't the floor for this correction is probably the best options trader barely misses. "
"903800","906080"," A tough one to say."
"906600","907740"," What do I think about that?"
"908900","910260"," He's a great options trader."
"910860","914180"," I know that he's fighting right now with forget his name. "
"915760","917060"," It's a tough one to say."
"918580","920880"," We'll get back into that one here in just a moment."
"921560","927300"," But I want to know if you think he's the best options trader ever, where do you think we wind"
"927300","928080"," up for?"
"930020","931260"," Let's say right now. "
"931940","934300"," Do you think we hit $4,700 right now?"
"934420","938580"," Do you think we hit $4,700 after we hit $4, $28?"
"939820","941200"," It's like, give me some timing on this."
"941740","948120"," I always seem like bears throw numbers like this out and ask you questions like this, right?"
"948740","949780"," Eventually they're right."
"950440","953760"," But getting there, you blow up your accounts, right?"
"954900","958600"," So I want more information, RS, and what you're saying?"
"959600","964720"," Are you saying that you think that we go to $4,700 or $4,800 right now or by the"
"964720","965800"," 18th of February?"
"967700","970960"," Was I positive that we hit $4,28 before?"
"972200","976120"," I don't think we hit $4,28 on February 18th. "
"976640","978020"," I think you actually see it sooner."
"978420","979500"," But I'm interested in that."
"980520","981320"," Pop then fade. "
"981940","983360"," I don't know if it pops and fades this morning."
"985160","986940"," Maybe looking for resistance this morning."
"986940","988800"," That's where we're on the hunt for resistance. "
"990440","992460"," Yeah, Spouse up $2.6 last night."
"992660","994120"," I can go up $2.6 even today."
"996940","998960"," Joey Harper is a diamond-handed bear. "
"999140","999540"," Good job."
"1000760","1004080"," Let me take a look here."
"1004700","1005540"," We're almost on the opener. "
"1005740","1006700"," I got to get my stuff set up."
"1012900","1016860"," Yeah, we all know our first resistance point is at $4, $54, $87, right?"
"1019630","1022250"," Like that we sell off or off the bell, it's possible, but I doubt it."
"1024290","1026150"," Maybe closed below $4.50 for the week. "
"1026569","1030329"," So let's say it could be a short from $4.54. I like that number two."
"1032750","1038550"," Well, someone bought $4.80. I'm asking that question because I'll bring up a charlator."
"1038869","1041270"," What I'm going to do is post a chart for you. "
"1042230","1050510"," And there are bought $4.80 calls, a stack of them, a stack of $4.80 calls."
"1052010","1053390"," I don't know who bought them."
"1053630","1054910"," I know that someone bought them recently. "
"1055810","1057550"," And so let me bring this up."
"1057690","1059810"," Let me bring up the actual chart here for you."
"1063860","1065120"," Bring up this main display. "
"1070820","1072460"," And it's not like a retail trader bottom."
"1073680","1081460"," This showed up this morning before the open $4.76. Look at this up here, $4.74. We didn't see"
"1081460","1082100"," this yesterday."
"1082100","1091000"," A bunch of sellers above at $4.74. And I think one of the guys from"
"1091000","1099240"," S.G. in an interview, there's an interview on YouTube from this weekend, like an hour-long"
"1099240","1105340"," interview where he said, who owns the $4.80 calls that are expiring. "
"1105540","1113900"," I don't know if they're expiring this week or next week, but it's the largest social value of calls"
"1113900","1114420"," expiring."
"1114520","1115260"," Is that $4.80?"
"1117160","1119240"," And I think they expire Friday, but it could be later."
"1122340","1123540"," But somebody bought them, right?"
"1124680","1126060"," There's always a buyer to sell her. "
"1126140","1128040"," And you look up here, this just showed up this morning."
"1128180","1129720"," This was not here yesterday."
"1132280","1134680"," So we'll keep an eye on that today. "
"1134680","1142020"," And we've got more buyers than sellers right up, right?"
"1142240","1144480"," Coming right up into the bell just heads up on that as well."
"1145820","1153760"," Looks like we've got some resistance showing up at $4.60, which is significantly higher."
"1155640","1159500"," Now, this is all bound to change once we open up the market this morning. "
"1175180","1178060"," And there are landmines all over the place, four bulls."
"1219050","1220610"," And I've got some calls, too."
"1223650","1225810"," So, matter of fact, you've got to take a look at those calls. "
"1227590","1235690"," So though I want to be rooting for these calls to print off the bell, I don't think that they"
"1235690","1235850"," do."
"1235930","1239570"," I don't think that they go crazy high this morning."
"1251310","1255310"," I've got a bunch of what do I have?"
"1255310","1261790"," I've got January 21st, 470C, 464C, 460C. "
"1262750","1266230"," I've got January 24th, 470C."
"1266990","1271110"," I've got January 26th, 475C."
"1272350","1274770"," That I picked up heading into the close yesterday. "
"1276250","1278970"," I had a couple that I owned before the first drop."
"1280850","1284570"," And I closed some puts yesterday into the bell as well."
"1284570","1292030"," And then rotated in and traded our ones that I had was holding earlier, ended up dog cost averaging"
"1292030","1298310"," down those options, and then added some more for a snapback play off the bell this morning. "
"1299150","1305430"," But I'm not holding the interesting part is, if this was any other time, I would be holding these"
"1305970","1308230"," and not trying to sell them at some point."
"1309350","1314870"," So I don't have a viewpoint this morning where I think, hey, I bought the exact right time."
"1315030","1319830"," We're going up to 480 or 475 or any kind of nonsense like that. "
"1327720","1331600"," It's going to get some stuff set up here because the bell is about to ring."
"1331720","1334980"," I want to see what the flow is like this morning."
"1336380","1337280"," And you'll know it. "
"1337360","1342380"," If we have a B-shaped recovery, you'll know it in just the flow that's coming out."
"1342580","1344220"," You'll know it in everything else that's going on."
"1344700","1351400"," If you guys remember yesterday we talked about about the end of the day, after the bell. "
"1351800","1360500"," If any of you logged off yesterday after the bell, a ton of flow came in after the bell yesterday."
"1362060","1365060"," I almost lost my trade and account."
"1366680","1371480"," A ton of hedging activity came into the market after the bell yesterday. "
"1371680","1373440"," That's going to affect us today at some point."
"1373440","1401750"," I just"
"1401750","1403950"," know it's right now on IWM."
"1405470","1424360"," Looks like we've got support down below right now currently at 202.56. Shock"
"1424360","1426940"," C 360. "
"1428480","1430780"," We're just talking about 390 the other day, right?"
"1433400","1435540"," Same thing down here, 360, 11."
"1449210","1451050"," This is firming up above here."
"1470900","1473600"," Oh, this market's going down, I promise you that. "
"1484100","1491380"," I would say that if you're a bear, this is one of those times where you go down to your"
"1491380","1493020"," bunker and just wait until they print."
"1496200","1497940"," Wait until your puts print."
"1551480","1587900"," So right"
"1587900","1596580"," off the bell this morning, Tesla, January 21, 1030 P puts $860 "

"2260680","2266080"," We're going to need to pump out a couple million to not be catching knives on Ford this morning. "
"2271370","2274270"," Because the bears are on attack of Ford at this point."
"2276650","2286490"," And Ford's ripping up, it's at $22.29. You need to keep the calls flowing in to keep Ford up"

"2337490","2339490"," Talk about adding insult to injury."
"2340330","2344210"," Like the one time it goes up, it was last time it was at 80 bucks, it's been a while."
"2345950","2353910"," 2013 Twitter was at $74, it's a long time to be waiting to go back to 80 bucks. "
"2354530","2356030"," And then you get knocked right back down again."
"2356790","2358090"," Now you're down to 38 bucks again."
"2360150","2362650"," So there are some calls coming out this morning on Twitter. "
"2377610","2378990"," Market is moving higher."
"2378990","2385890"," I do, if you are, I'm going to bring up some Tesla for you guys out there because Tesla has"
"2385890","2390430"," some massive call hedging coming in this morning."
"2391210","2393110"," This is hard to deny at this point. "
"2393550","2397530"," Now we now have new Tesla calls coming through."
"2399690","2405330"," Tesla, February 18th, 1000 C for $2.9 million."
"2405890","2409530"," So this is the most bullish stock this morning. "
"2410310","2412990"," What a way to tease the market alive, huh?"
"2414630","2418630"," If you're going to tease the market alive and get the bulls all fired up."
"2419990","2426410"," If the market's on life support, what stock do you pump to get everybody all pumped up?"
"2426870","2428130"," And here we go again."
"2428650","2436270"," Tesla, February 18th, 1000 C for $4.6 million this morning. "
"2437250","2437910"," Look at that, right?"
"2438070","2440610"," It's shot of adrenaline into the heart of the market."
"2442950","2448870"," Shocker, so I'm going to post these trades directly to Twitter this morning so you guys can see"
"2448870","2450790"," them because I don't know if you believe me or not."
"2451830","2459190"," So for a total of $12.2 million right outside of the gate this morning, we've got Tesla. "
"2460510","2463070"," Should I be surprised at this?"
"2463890","2471010"," No, you know, just for what took place yesterday to see this this morning, right?"
"2471810","2479650"," Just just it's like you've got a bank like Goldman Sachs, a good like Jamie Diamond from JPM's"
"2479650","2482670"," like, well, we got to bring the market back a little bit."
"2482750","2483470"," How do we do that?"
"2485090","2490090"," And you got some stooge in the corner that's like, oh, you know, you just pump up."
"2490270","2491710"," You prop up up Apple tomorrow. "
"2492270","2495070"," And Jamie Diamond's like, now we need something better than that."
"2495730","2498630"," And so they're like, oh, of course, you just pump out your pump Tesla."
"2499370","2500390"," That's all you have to do. "
"2500390","2501590"," Bring out the testables."
"2502410","2504630"," The testables will get all over social media."
"2505190","2506390"," It'll be like we're going up, bro. "
"2506810","2507690"," We're going up."
"2509010","2510650"," So it's kind of a hilarious thing."
"2510670","2512430"," We're going to post this on Twitter right now. "
"2530120","2539240"," So we've got three calls, three sets of calls for a grand total of $12.2 million going long on"
"2539240","2540200"," Tesla this morning."
"2541100","2542480"," And they've got these called."
"2542640","2545280"," These are short dated for $12.2 million. "
"2545900","2548840"," They're not three months out or six months out."
"2549040","2551240"," This is some risk being put on in the market this morning."
"2551620","2558320"," Right off the bell, although I would really like to see those calls be like 1200 C's. "
"2558720","2562400"," Put like 10 or 12 million soft bank if you're listening out there."
"2563120","2568380"," Place $12 or $20 million in calls are like 1400 C, bro."
"2570120","2571240"," 1400 C."
"2573080","2577000"," So I got those posted to my public accounts. "
"2577300","2580020"," I'll post them to the private account for you."
"2584790","2589570"," So if you want to inject cocaine in the system of the market this morning, Tesla's probably the way"
"2589570","2589870"," to go."
"2590650","2592330"," I'm going to ask you guys this morning. "
"2593150","2594670"," I haven't been around."
"2596310","2601450"," I haven't been around the GME gang in some time."
"2603390","2607010"," The original GME gang I was with. "
"2608530","2610130"," So we'll keep Tesla up here."
"2610130","2611650"," We're talking about Tesla."
"2612310","2616890"," But yesterday I went into one of like the superstar subs on it. "
"2619470","2621090"," And I got a hair from you guys."
"2621270","2622150"," What you guys think of this."
"2622770","2626450"," So I'm inside of this subreddit last night. "
"2629190","2632010"," And they're trying to say."
"2634190","2635310"," Or I guess there are."
"2637150","2645890"," There are people buying GME stock that think it's going to trade at like"
"2645890","2648410"," $2 million a share. "
"2650250","2651530"," But is that real?"
"2656980","2658840"," Yeah, there's both low on MSFT."
"2659200","2660340"," Do you guys know anything about this?"
"2661080","2668340"," Are there really traders and investors that think that GME is going to like $200,000 a share?"
"2669960","2671820"," $100,000 a share."
"2672880","2674580"," Because that's what I'm reading. "
"2676940","2679560"," I'm a little taken aback by that."
"2682720","2692580"," I wonder how many people were in the original run up on on GME."
"2694200","2696440"," Because they basically pulled the plug. "
"2698660","2700900"," Yeah, I really I mean, get the GME gang."
"2702040","2705600"," I don't I don't I don't and it's it's not like you can't squeeze."
"2706560","2711700"," But I was reading some really crazy shit like it's going to squeeze the 200,000. "
"2712980","2715740"," Like this has to be naivety because."
"2717800","2722820"," If that shit squeezed past 500 bucks, they would pull the fucking plug on it."
"2724400","2726620"," The greed of old men knows no bounds. "
"2728760","2731400"," No bounds, which is terrible to say."
"2743000","2747260"," Oh, look, markets moving up."
"2790710","2793290"," It's got MSFT call flow coming in. "
"2794470","2798010"," We've got MSFT $1.5 million."
"2800430","2804650"," $4, $14, 310c by the bucket loads."
"2806830","2807650"," We've got. "
"2810030","2812770"," I'll post that flow for you on Twitter as well."
"2815930","2818610"," Just had a bear step in on Tesla."
"2819330","2822330"," We've got hood hood call flow coming in this morning. "
"2822330","2823730"," AFRM more call."
"2823990","2827490"," So AFRM, we've got February 18th, 75c."
"2828070","2829890"," Keep your eyes on that ticker. "
"2829890","2831670"," It's a traders favorite."
"2832410","2837070"," AFRM February 18th, 75c for $432,000."
"2837570","2841210"," Massive call flow on on Tesla misfit this morning. "
"2841930","2845930"," We also have very unusual call flow on hood this morning."
"2846410","2848590"," January 21, 15c."
"2849890","2852670"," And then we have, you don't want to post this stuff. "
"2852770","2854450"," We've got, it's kind of wonky right now."
"2854870","2857770"," You got a bear that stepped in and traded."
"2858970","2865430"," January 21, 1030p for a million dollars on Tesla. "
"2865450","2872030"," So I'm wondering if that's a part of the original trade or if that's some kind of protection while"
"2872030","2878790"," going along or if that's a bank that doesn't realize that so much money is coming into Tesla at the"
"2878790","2879030"," moment."
"2880490","2887450"," So I'm going to post that Microsoft flow and the Tesla flow once again on the, oh no, I think"
"2887450","2888690"," I already showed you the Tesla flow."
"2889290","2892350"," I'll show you the misfit and then the AFRM flow as well. "
"2894270","2897430"," I haven't seen my firm calls like this in some time."
"2902120","2908080"," So a grand total of $8 million on misfit flow on MSFT."
"3019160","3034040"," This is generally an area that I'm interested in in the market right now if we"
"3034040","3035040"," move up from here. "
"3042800","3046820"," GME did, you know, I'm like topic of conversation about GME."
"3047420","3056960"," Off the bell they did trade up from 108 to 112.50. So they're up 5% this morning off"
"3056960","3057360"," the bell."
"3058120","3065880"," It's just interesting that that traders think that the market itself, that the banks themselves"
"3065880","3069820"," will allow a stock ticker to go up to $2 million. "
"3070480","3077310"," And the reason why I bring that up is because if you recall any crash that we've ever had in"
"3077310","3086330"," the past, there are times in the market where no one wants to buy or pay you for even shorts."
"3087090","3088950"," They don't want to pay you for your puts."
"3088950","3091230"," That has happened many times in the past. "
"3092090","3101250"," And so I don't see why anyone would want to pay you for a stock that goes to the price"
"3101250","3108630"," of $200,000 or $1 million, $2 million, no one's going to pay it."
"3109070","3110930"," And that's the problem with that viewpoint."
"3111730","3117270"," So I wonder, is this like a subreddit now that's just become a bunch of robots, some bots out"
"3117270","3117510"," there?"
"3117510","3119310"," Is this, do people really think this stuff?"
"3119870","3122510"," Are our kids thinking that that's going to take place?"
"3123230","3129470"," I was involved in trading GME when they pulled the plug the last time, right?"
"3130710","3136790"," And we know that that quote-unquote, Robin Hood didn't have capital and the order flow of companies"
"3136790","3145430"," in the background for a bunch of different, I don't know, face four brokerages didn't have the"
"3145430","3152530"," capital necessary, but in the reality of things, they were going to pull that fucking plug one way"
"3152530","3152870"," or another. "
"3154290","3156670"," And I remember some traders got caught in it."
"3159170","3165390"," And I remember that the traders that didn't get caught in it were real about getting out, taking"
"3165390","3166150"," their money and running."
"3166530","3170830"," I remember that some traders, I remember the first time they did it, the first time they plugged"
"3170830","3175470"," it, whether they cut it off, I remember hearing two camps, right?"
"3175590","3179810"," You had one camp that was like, take the money and run, and then another camp that was like, oh"
"3179810","3181370"," no, man, we'll go right back out of tomorrow. "
"3181450","3184570"," And of course, it never came back again like it did."
"3184730","3189570"," Once the momentum was gone, once they pulled the plug, the party was over."
"3191050","3192850"," Invariably, it was over, right?"
"3193130","3198910"," Because they're tipping their cards to you, letting you know that there ain't no fucking way you're"
"3198910","3199290"," doing it. "
"3200110","3201270"," You just knocked on us."
"3201410","3205070"," So I wonder why this subreddit is going crazy right now."
"3205670","3208210"," And I love GME gang, love the apes. "
"3209630","3210930"," Got nothing against them."
"3211070","3215410"," But when I see posts where people are taking it serious, that they think they're going to buy"
"3215410","3222350"," shares of GMC and AMC, specifically GME, and it's going to go to two million dollars."
"3223190","3224870"," They're very well smoking crack. "
"3225110","3225910"," They think that's happening."
"3227350","3234750"," Okay, so we got some more calls coming in this morning on Wells Fargo company, January 28th, 57C,"
"3235210","3240370"," spy calls coming in this morning, 456C for January 21st."
"3240790","3249450"," Apple calls coming in this morning, $700,000 on Apple, 175C, January 28th. "
"3250830","3257310"," Some GM calls coming in this morning, March 18th, 60C, for $242,000."
"3261700","3265780"," We are moving much higher on spy right now."
"3265940","3268160"," We're at 457, 01. "
"3269900","3271580"," This isn't up here."
"3271640","3277480"," I want you to see this every gets a little bit of rejection point firming up above here at 459,"
"3278360","3278360"," 88."
"3279040","3493330"," So mark this on your chart above here, making"
"3493330","3495410"," some money on some calls this morning. "
"3496310","3499090"," So I'm hoping some of you are making some money as well."
"3567700","3568060"," So we're"
"3568060","3581880"," going"
"3618070","3618350"," to make a little something over here."
"3618930","3618950"," So I'm going to take a little bit of this here and thank you for the support of a friend"
"3618950","3619050"," that's coming in this morning. "
"3619050","3619050"," you for this."
"3619130","3619190"," I may or may not be able to hear the answer."
"3619190","3619210"," Thank you. "
"3619210","3619370"," Thank you."
"3619370","3756600"," So At $4.56.89, more sellers at $4.56.78. There"
"3756600","3768260"," is some significant inflow into January 21, 460C."
"3783040","3790320"," Let's see if there's still sellers above at $4.60. These are pretty significant sellers here. "
"3790320","3794360"," Could you have more buyers than sellers?"
"3795160","3796560"," Hero indicator is green."
"3801600","3826750"," There are a batch of sellers above here at $4.59.77. And also note,"
"3826970","3833450"," there's still sellers above hiding above here at $4.57 or so."
"3834290","3836330"," These have not been exhausted yet. "
"3836930","3842890"," If you have a little bit of a bigger red bar down below here, the seller is being absorbed."
"3847560","3851220"," It looks like I'd be looking for the $4.60 mark as your next stop."
"3898480","3900080"," Now there's some more traffic. "
"3901720","3909500"," There's more traffic above here at $4.57.66, $4.58, $12."
"3909500","3916700"," And then of course, everybody knows about $4.60 due to the high from yesterday."
"3929280","3935540"," Watching some more call flow come in on the spy, January 21, 455C. "
"3940640","3944940"," More wells Fargo, I pay attention to XLF this morning."
"3945160","3947880"," I've seen a lot of calls coming in on the banks."
"3949220","3952180"," Also some call flow coming in on TSM. "
"3953700","3958580"," So far calls coming in still with some weight on it."
"3959160","3964700"," July 15, 15C, $324,000."
"3968830","3971450"," China stocks getting some love this morning as well. "
"4013540","4018640"," And just a heads up, I did sell out of my calls at that 457 area."
"4018640","4024980"," I did go very green up there at $4.57. And now I'm just looking for a place to re "
"4024980","4026700","-short the market at this point."
"4027140","4030580"," So if you're a bear, just be waiting to short the market. "
"4031820","4034060"," You'll be looking for a wave."
"4034200","4038840"," You'll be looking for this hair indicator return negative, of course, a wave of sellers entering"
"4038840","4039520"," the scene."
"4039940","4042880"," You're just kind of sitting back and waiting to see what happens. "
"4044040","4050020"," This is still not the recovery that you're looking for or the signs of a healthy recovery."
"4050240","4054160"," You have limited breath in who's carrying the market right now."
"4055280","4058340"," This still does not look like a V-shaped recovery. "
"4061120","4063600"," So we're waiting to see what takes place this morning."
"4614990","4618390"," All right, I just want to keep you guys abreast of the situation."
"4620190","4623110"," The bears are stepping in at this moment. "
"4624390","4628550"," On the in the market, which is a little could be a little bit early."
"4628550","4629930"," I really want to see."
"4631890","4635690"," I really want to see the first bears stepping in. "
"4636630","4639570"," I guess I can see bears stepping in here."
"4640450","4644030"," Really like to see it slightly higher like for 5789."
"4645430","4649190"," Maybe for the first wave of bears to throw himself to market. "
"4649390","4653050"," But I got to make you aware that bears are stepping in slightly."
"4653790","4660550"," There are some misfit puts coming in 121 302.5, only $78,000."
"4661430","4665790"," Nvidia only $49,000, but it's January 21 to 40 P."
"4666790","4671570"," And then we have spy puts for $225,000. "
"4672090","4675870"," 454 P expiring on January 21st."
"4675910","4677650"," MU has some puts coming in."
"4679610","4685450"," 318 92.5 P for 8 for $762,000. "
"4686530","4687470"," Basically $750,000."
"4688850","4690790"," More spy puts coming in right now."
"4690790","4695410"," January 21, 454 P, that's $230,000. "
"4696350","4700790"," AU puts, that's June 17, 20 P, right?"
"4700890","4703250"," It's small, tiny ticker, $400,000."
"4703930","4708450"," And now we have another rack of spy puts coming in, 454 P for $200,000."
"4709570","4710550"," January 21st. "
"4710790","4714470"," So there's the first wave of bulls are starting to step in at this moment."
"4715070","4716870"," Excuse me, bears are stepping in at this moment."
"4717390","4718430"," That's what we had expected. "
"4718470","4719710"," It's a little bit early, I think."
"4719750","4720610"," I could be wrong in this."
"4722170","4728230"," I would like to see a spy go up slightly, but this is the first area where bears want to"
"4728230","4729030"," begin to reject. "
"4730190","4732490"," Be conscious of that in the market currently."
"4734410","4737850"," There is some by the dippers down here at 455 66."
"4738590","4742830"," If we do trade down from here, I'm going to give you some price targets. "
"4745370","4746690"," We do trade down."
"4746810","4748650"," You're going to be looking for support at 454 93."
"4749650","4753170"," And then 454 47 and 454 25. "
"4754650","4757790"," This might be just be a quick day trade right here for the bears."
"4758890","4763950"," I'm hoping that the bears wait a little bit longer before going full, full crazy."
"4764530","4768030"," Just had some more spy puts come in 121, 454. "
"4768030","4771110"," For $150,000."
"4772030","4776350"," And puts another rack of 454 P's coming in for $200,000."
"4776890","4778990"," This is close to a million dollars at this point. "
"4779930","4782890"," 454 P looks like a day trade at this point."
"4961860","4965020"," So Twitter is just moving up on its own this morning."
"4965580","4969660"," It just saw June 16, 454 C's come in on Twitter. "
"4970540","4972200"," Keep your heads up on Twitter this morning."
"4972560","4974860"," Also, we have some bullish call flow this morning."
"4974860","4981860"," ZTS July 15, 210 C for a million dollars. "
"4983160","5268900"," ZTS a beautiful"
"5268900","5270940"," short covering at this point."
"5271640","5276320"," I am looking for a tag above here at this 457 72."
"5276800","5283980"," And just like a magnet earlier, remember that we remember we had that mark above at 459, I think"
"5283980","5289820"," right up in here, 458, 92 slightly lower now. "
"5290000","5294740"," Some of the sellers are starting to reach down at 459, 69."
"5295560","5305140"," And I am looking for more of a rejection here at, I think we talked about this earlier, 457, 97,"
"5305960","5307100"," 457, 92."
"5308880","5310840"," See if there's any rejection at that point. "
"5310840","5313740"," There are more calls coming in right now."
"5314080","5315080"," It is a mixed bag."
"5315340","5323400"," There's GM has 1.6 million dollars on June 17, 55 C."
"5324620","5327080"," Some calls on C."
"5328500","5330920"," March 4, 67 C."
"5332040","5333180"," Treat there are two times. "
"5333620","5336760"," AFRM just keeps ripping, ripping higher and higher."
"5336760","5340120"," Put is ripping higher and higher this morning as well."
"5341160","5343800"," Tesla continues to rip higher at this point. "
"5345360","5358400"," I also"
"5358400","5368280"," want to point out that if you switch from a two minute"
"5368280","5378120"," chart on the VIX to a one hour chart on the VIX, it tells a completely different story"
"5378120","5382280"," as to what's happening in the background of the market right now."
"5382580","5390560"," The conscience of the VIX showing two different looking charts out there."
"5390820","5401680"," Take a"
"5401680","5406380"," look at the two hour chart and then take a look at the two minute chart on the VIX. "
"5417360","5422100"," And on that note, you know about that expanding megaphone that we have on the VIX."
"5422240","5426500"," I think we posted this chart on the expanding megaphone on the VIX."
"5426600","5429100"," There is a little bit of a turn here on the VIX. "
"5430180","5431680"," Just be conscious of that."
"5431860","5437820"," You are looking for where we should trade down here in the VIX from a two minute chart."
"5437960","5446260"," We should trade down from 22.15, possibly to 21.92. Bounce around a little bit. "
"5446800","5451580"," But you would think that the next stop would be a move much, much higher."
"5452780","5456000"," So this still looks like we're going to reject at some point today."
"5456420","5457440"," Just keep an eye on the VIX. "
"5457560","5458620"," We put it on a two minute chart."
"5459300","5462770"," You can actually just visualize an expanding megaphone."
"5463340","5468240"," It's been trading in this megaphone now since the 18th. "
"5468980","5471460"," We are at the bottom of this megaphone at the moment."
"5471460","5476960"," And if you wanted to get uber bullish and say, hey, we're going to do a V shape recovery or"
"5476960","5482920"," a crown type recovery, you're going to be looking for this VIX structure to break below the"
"5482920","5483500"," megaphone."
"5483680","5490560"," If you are ready or saying, hey, I'm a bear and I want to take the short, you want to"
"5490560","5496960"," be looking for this basing activity down here in this megaphone and then a rip higher to somewhere"
"5496960","5500340"," around 24, 25 or so. "
"5502760","5506300"," Watching some Twitter puts coming in at 70, 70 grand."
"5506600","5507380"," Not really a ton of it."
"5507880","5511980"," 121, 39 p Twitter's been on fire this morning. "
"5512740","5516100"," Also watching some more calls coming in on MU so far."
"5516440","5518280"," More calls coming in on a firm."
"5519240","5521760"," GM $1.6 million in calls. "
"5522160","5525220"," Amazing calls coming in on hurts this morning."
"5527060","5534180"," HTZ also have calls coming in on AMD, PFE and video."
"5536420","5542360"," More calls on MU and now the spy January 21, 459 C."
"5543840","5545330"," For $176,000. "
"5546240","5550000"," And that does seem reasonable to trade up to that 460 mark."
"5552380","5555100"," First little contentious part should be right where we are."
"5555180","5556380"," This 457 area. "
"5557540","5561140"," And this price target above disappeared for a little bit."
"5561560","5563500"," Looks like some of the sellers came down below."
"5564480","5569740"," But just like yesterday, we had a target price target below down here at 450. "
"5570360","5573380"," It does look like the sellers are hiding above that 460."
"5573380","5583320"," And that would be your next, that would be your next large"
"5583320","5584860"," resistance zone."
"5585360","5587380"," So we've got nice resistance here at 450. "
"5589040","5590800"," And get this exact here."
"5595860","5597060"," Almost right where we are."
"5597240","5599380"," 457, 60, 457, 64. "
"5600000","5601980"," This is your next resistance point."
"5602200","5607500"," And just above that you'll have another one from the high from yesterday at 459, 61."
"5717660","5720820"," Watching puts come in on AMGN. "
"5722320","5726660"," That's alpha, mic, gamma, November, AMGN."
"5727940","5730260"," February 18, 220 P."
"5731220","5734580"," High, I'll go score $287,000."
"5781180","5787000"," Next rejection point should be 450, 450, 809. "
"5787000","5788640"," Or at least volatility."
"5789960","5793380"," And then above you're looking at 459, 38 or so."
"5804540","5806580"," Just had a golden ticket come in. "
"5807560","5811140"," The ticker number or ticker is STLD."
"5812360","5815120"," Sierra Tango Lima Delta."
"5816240","5821200"," August 19, 60 C for $1.2 million. "
"5861590","5863710"," That ticker is steel dynamics."
"5864490","5866390"," A materials trade."
"5868770","5875190"," When golden tickets come out, it is sometimes not always sometimes they run with how you're getting"
"5875190","5877350"," in on them, but you want to usually snap. "
"5877870","5878390"," It's direction."
"5878750","5885570"," You want to either look for a trend change or a trade down to pick up that trade."
"5885570","5893830"," So if you're going to follow that trade on STLD, you may want to wait for a pullback to the"
"5893830","5898350"," 5978 area to take that trade on. "
"5898830","5901030"," Sometimes you have to jump on them right when they come in."
"5901530","5908110"," But if you missed it, there's usually another opportunity for entry if they're already trending up."
"5908350","5910150"," Sometimes the golden tickets come in and we're trading down. "
"5910550","5912830"," You want to wait for the turn to pick those golden tickets up."
"5913970","5917850"," Currently at this moment, it is ripping higher at this moment."
"5918010","5919050"," You might miss that trade. "
"5919790","5922550"," You have to pick out your own risk profile on that trade."
"5931280","5932700"," Again, that's steel dynamics."
"5933320","5935460"," It's STLD golden ticket. "
"5936260","5941660"," August 19, 60 C for $1.2 million."
"5942500","5947680"," You could also ride it for just today on some zero dates or the closest or the closest expiring in"
"5947680","5950800"," the money call."
"5969370","5973850"," We're going to take a look at Tesla here and see if it can break above resistance. "
"5978590","5981670"," Tesla seems to be grinding away and it's in this trouble."
"5981770","5986090"," It's not really trouble like a negative, but it is inside of this zone right here."
"5986250","5988650"," It's trying to stay above 1031. "
"5989510","5994430"," They broke above this resistance and now they're just kind of grinding away."
"5995210","6001770"," The price target on Tesla right now is, of course, $10.50. We'll look above in case you're uber"
"6001770","6002270"," bullish."
"6020850","6023650"," Also watching more Twitter calls come in this morning. "
"6024590","6030890"," June 16, 50 C for $466,000."
"6034380","6039640"," So your roof right now in Tesla is $10.50. This is unusual to see on Tesla."
"6039640","6045760"," There's a little bit of volatility in some ice above the $10.70. Clear skies to $1,100 then at"
"6045760","6046220"," that point. "
"6046640","6049440"," Normally you see a little bit more resistance above here."
"6049940","6051520"," This is unusual to see on Tesla."
"6052240","6056440"," Not common to see such clean resistance above. "
"6056800","6058500"," Even though there is some ice stuck in here."
"6061680","6068340"," The next target on Tesla is going to be $10.50. Let's take a look again."
"6069360","6078080"," The real resistance above is at 1048.72. We are starting to break above this weak resistance here"
"6078080","6078680"," at 1035. "
"6079600","6080200"," 1040."
"6081180","6084160"," You are going to be looking to take this trade at 1050 at least."
"6085440","6088460"," So we'll stay here on Tesla at the moment for you Teslables. "
"6184460","6185800"," Watching another round."
"6185820","6189940"," This is the second round of puts on AMGN."
"6190820","6196400"," Earlier we saw February 18th, 220p for $300,000. "
"6196940","6202020"," Just saw another round of puts on AMGN."
"6203460","6208260"," February 18th, 220p again but this time for $620,000."
"6209080","6213780"," So it's a full million dollars in puts against AMGN. "
"6214780","6218620"," That's Alpha Mike Gamma November AMGN."
"6219860","6223340"," Also watching more calls come in on C."
"6224560","6231240"," June 17th, 62.5 calls now for $677,000."
"6257950","6262130"," That $460 looks like the price target on spy still. "
"6262630","6267110"," We'll get a little bit more granular here and see if there's much resistance above."
"6267110","6276100"," We have a little bit of ice above here at 458.49. Buyers are definitely in control on the spy"
"6276100","6276820"," at this point."
"6346940","6349420"," Watching more call flow come in on the spy. "
"6350520","6356880"," January 21st, 461 C calls on spy."
"6508760","6512200"," Teslables are breaking through resistance here at 1039."
"6513020","6517100"," Your next area of light resistance is at 1044, 25. "
"6518120","6521080"," And your price target is 1050 on Tesla."
"6522660","6523860"," Another 11 points."

"6668990","6670170"," Ew is Z."
"6670590","6671770"," That's Echo."
"6673510","6675430"," I forget what W is anymore."
"6676430","6679830"," Whatever the sign is for that, I'm getting old. "
"6680930","6682130"," Ew Z."
"6684450","6685130"," 12831C."
"6686490","6689290"," Also more call flow coming in on CCL."
"6689770","6699720"," March 18th, 22.5. If you're looking for a bounce to pick up the spy, if you still have"
"6699720","6706100"," been hesitant at this point, look for somewhere around 45726. "
"6708740","6709380"," 45762."
"6710060","6712800"," You can possibly ride it up to that 459 number."
"6731390","6737150"," Looks like everybody's in on 460C. "
"6743450","6747610"," Seeing some more calls in 461."
"6752940","6755120"," But I wouldn't hold the 461, right?"
"6755600","6759220"," You're going to be looking to exit whatever calls are in by the time we get to 460."
"6759780","6761880"," That should be a pretty turbulent area. "
"6766140","6769960"," If you're a bear, that's probably going to be the place that you're going to look for."
"6770800","6773760"," We saw the bears step in briefly earlier."
"6774220","6777020"," It seemed like it was a little too early for the bears. "
"6777740","6783060"," They stepped in back before around 10 a.m. They took a shot at it."
"6783120","6784320"," They dumped it down slightly."
"6785080","6792540"," They didn't really get down below 455.55. You might have some bears stepping in at some point. "
"6792660","6794280"," I see some puts coming in on Uber."
"6795660","6799700"," January 2142 P for half million dollars."
"6800400","6802160"," I would be wary of it. "
"6802340","6803920"," Still wary of entering short here."
"6803920","6808680"," I'm going to be looking to enter short above at this 460 number."
"6810620","6820120"," Also watching some puts come in on XBI biotech ETF February 11 99 P for half million"
"6820120","6821080"," dollars. "
"6822460","6824960"," So that puts us stacking up a little bit."
"6825020","6827640"," Still not enough to call this."
"6827840","6829760"," We're getting bearish at this point. "
"6829760","6836160"," Maybe just a moment here in the morning at 11 a.m. You'll see us trade down slightly and then"
"6836160","6838040"," make another move up to the 460 number."
"6841890","6844210"," Just another moment until another pump comes through."
"6844630","6849690"," You really want to be waiting if you're bearish to re-enter short until you see a wall or a"
"6849690","6850450"," wave of puts. "
"6851170","6853190"," We're not quite seeing that at this moment."
"6856540","6862960"," We're still kind of riding up the 21 M.A., the 21 daily moving average on the spy."
"6862960","6865900"," We just touched it again just at this moment. "
"6866500","6868280"," We're running up on the daily at least."
"6868460","6875360"," If you're on the Mac or the simple moving average 21 M.A. on the spy on a daily chart"
"6875360","6876240"," on the one minute."
"6877200","6886560"," We traded slightly below it to the 50 M.A. on the daily chart in one minute earlier at like"
"6886560","6887940"," 10 17 this morning. "
"6888640","6897820"," So if you wanted to wait for that 50 M.A., that price target is $4.57.09. I guess"
"6897820","6904100"," your two price targets to take long on spy is right where we just were at $4.57.80. Next"
"6904100","6910660"," tag would be $4.57.20 somewhere in there to grab another 15 minute trade."
"6910660","6917120"," Seeing some more XBI puts come in February 18, 1994 P."
"6919390","6927490"," Also watching pretty decent calls coming in on Vail, V-A-L-E March 18, 16 C."
"6928510","6929130"," And that's significant."
"6929650","6931270"," It's $234,000. "
"6932190","6935190"," That second XBI put that came in."
"6935190","6938390"," So the first one that came in an XBI was $500,000."
"6939030","6943770"," The second one that came in on XBI was $1.4 million. "
"6944710","6947570"," That one was significant to now $2 million against XBI."
"6948390","6950150"," XBI can't seem to catch a break."
"6962010","6963690"," Good morning, Randall Holt. "
"6964070","6965430"," Thank you for subscribing, brother."
"6965970","6967510"," Always appreciate a subscriber."
"6984220","6986180"," Now we should break above here in the spy. "
"6986500","6988020"," We're going to take a look a little bit closer here."
"6992180","6999640"," A little bit of seller stepping in now at $4.59 rather than we're above this $4.58.52. We"
"6999640","7000420"," should trade up here."
"7000940","7007340"," You'll start to see sellers start to trickle down from that $4.59 level. "
"7007500","7013660"," I know it's showing the sellers at $4.59.96. But you are going to be looking for them to"
"7013660","7015100"," slightly come down."
"7015100","7023500"," The bears don't want to see us get higher than the high from yesterday, right?"
"7023660","7028760"," So the high yesterday was $4.59.61 off the bell."
"7031400","7036700"," And so the bears will be looking to make a stand up there at $4.59.61 or so. "
"7037920","7044580"," They are hiding above at $4.59.96. So they are going to want to swoop in."
"7044580","7046280"," So we're going to pay attention to that number."
"7046400","7047220"," It's going to be important. "
"7047960","7051900"," If you are long in this market, you picked up calls there either at the belly yesterday or this"
"7051900","7052260"," morning."
"7052920","7059040"," You probably want to be taking some profit as we drive ourselves up here to this."
"7059220","7064700"," I'd say call like $4.59.60 or so somewhere in there, getting close to there. "
"7065780","7066520"," Take profit."
"7067160","7069540"," I tell this to the bears and the bulls all the time, right?"
"7069680","7070880"," You take your profit off the table."
"7070880","7074960"," You let the algos do the work for you if you're going to remain bullish. "
"7076620","7080380"," You coming out of your calls, you're not impacting the market, believe it or not."
"7081340","7085080"," The banks are the ones that run and control where we head in the market."
"7086460","7088480"," Take your cards, your money off the table. "
"7089640","7097560"," If you're still bullish, you wait until we break through that $4.59.60, $4.59.96 area."
"7097560","7101300"," You pick the trade back up again and you run it up higher."
"7102900","7107540"," But otherwise, if you've been in this trade all morning since the opening bell, look to be starting"
"7107540","7108900"," to get ready to take profit. "
"7109860","7116220"," We're coming into that area now where we start to grind or we start to reject."
"7120650","7122250"," You don't need all the money, right?"
"7122390","7124010"," You just need a portion of it."
"7131770","7137010"," We'll take a look at Tesla and see if it's going to slam up into the $4.60 area here. "
"7137710","7140330"," We're not $4.60, excuse me, $4.50 area."
"7141190","7143450"," You can see they're coming into some turbulence as well."
"7143910","7145310"," You can somewhat relate this. "
"7145450","7148550"," We'll look at Microsoft next and see what they're doing."
"7148550","7154850"," But you can see, right, there'll be this area of volatility as it comes up to this $4.50 area."
"7154850","7162370"," You'll end up seeing it, or not, sorry, I mean, $10.50. But you'll end up seeing feeders come down,"
"7162630","7162630"," right?"
"7163170","7170070"," The sellers will feed into this volatility area trying to resist and move up to $10.50. That"
"7170070","7176010"," doesn't mean we won't move up to $10.50 or tag $10.50. Just that, if you're trading, if you're"
"7176010","7181770"," trading and you're looking at your calls specifically, you'll start to see some of the value of"
"7181770","7184430"," them drop off as we move up to this $10.50 area. "
"7186740","7191320"," And next we'll look at, we're going to bring up Microsoft because that was another one that was"
"7191320","7194220"," pumped by the big boys this morning."
"7194480","7195740"," So look at Microsoft here."
"7197780","7200500"," And I'm sure the bears are getting itchy right at this point. "
"7201140","7202960"," Bears have to be getting itchy out there."
"7214500","7220260"," If you are looking forward to take a short on the market at this point, I'm still waiting for a"
"7220260","7220400"," bit."
"7220400","7223400"," I get kind of, I'm kind of cheap on both ends. "
"7224040","7229380"," So I don't know that you never want to listen to me, but I'm probably going to wait for rejection"
"7229380","7234300"," at the 459, maybe even 460."
"7234900","7243020"," Maybe we bounce above briefly on 460 and then we get rejected and move on down."
"7243280","7246420"," So I'm going to wait for that volatility zone to clear up a little bit. "
"7246500","7248960"," I don't want to get ground to bits up there."
"7248960","7256320"," And you can see right now, Microsoft just bashing around, wrecking the bears up here at 310.86."
"7256820","7258320"," They're going to be working towards 313."
"7261700","7264380"," And ultimately they have that same similar price target, right?"
"7264880","7268200"," Their price target above is going to be, let's take a look at this closer. "
"7270120","7274800"," It was, we got 312 up here that the bulls will be targeting."
"7275240","7281820"," And we're also ultimately looking for the 315 mark on the misfit Microsoft MSFT."
"7283160","7285560"," There is some volatility in here. "
"7285860","7288360"," So just be conscious of that if you're a bull trading Microsoft."
"7289420","7294760"," We called out Microsoft and Tesla off the bell this morning as the drivers of the market."
"7299500","7303040"," We have more CCL calls coming in at the moment. "
"7303480","7305740"," Whole bunch of calls on CCL."
"7306880","7310240"," And they're dated for February 18th, 20C."
"7312040","7319920"," As well, I've got three sets, three sets of calls on CCL, 20C, expiring February 18th. "
"7320720","7325740"," And then I've got one more set of calls on CCL March 18th, 20C."
"7326040","7328160"," I like that March 18th, 20C better."
"7328800","7332320"," It's a little bit more protection in case we do reverse at some point this morning. "
"7332860","7337080"," March 18th, 20C February 18th, 20C."
"7337080","7342880"," Now we have some more calls coming in on CCL February 18th, 20C."
"7343340","7346680"," So almost a million dollars in calls on CCL this morning. "
"7347860","7350800"," We also have more puts coming in right now."
"7350860","7357620"," We've got puts on the VIX VXX March 18th, 19P for $800,000."
"7358340","7360780"," XBI has more puts coming in. "
"7361360","7364160"," They've got February 11th, 97P."
"7364160","7366540"," Nobody likes XBI this morning."
"7376450","7379110"," XBI is just not getting the love today. "
"7548400","7551780"," All right."
"7551780","7554300"," I just bought February 7th."
"7554360","7562480"," XBI put spreads, 459, 458Ps, expiring on February 7th. "
"7563000","7573560"," They cost $40, they print $60, 50% probability of profit, 459, 458Ps,"
"7574340","7576380"," expiring February 7th."
"7608120","7611360"," And I'll get more aggressive with puts as we move up."
"7631320","7632720"," Microsoft is out. "
"7645780","7648400"," We have rejection on Tesla here."
"7648900","7650360"," We're down to 1032."
"7651420","7652920"," Buyers are still in control. "
"7653240","7655900"," The heroin indicator is slightly turning down here."
"7657460","7659160"," Let's take a look at the heroin indicator on Tesla."
"7671700","7673740"," We'll take a look at the spy as well. "
"7684340","7687140"," Nice push up into the 1109 hour."
"7687300","7691960"," Now we're trading down on the heroin indicator on Tesla as well."
"7693220","7696140"," You should see the bears stepping in at this point. "
"7696520","7699200"," This will be the first place that the bears will be taking a stand."
"7704000","7713040"," Also, just watch the bears step in with January 24, 455p for $200,000."
"7755760","7764340"," Also watching more ArkK puts come in January 28th, 76p for $76,000. "
"7765700","7768440"," More CCL calls coming in."
"7768780","7771540"," I'm going to post this call flow in CCL on Twitter."
"7772240","7775720"," CCL has just rapid fire calls coming in at this point. "
"7776480","7779280"," Nicola has calls coming in right now as well."
"7779760","7780980"," I'm not going to post those calls."
"7781660","7785080"," Not a fan of Nicola, but there are calls coming in on NKLA. "
"7811600","7812500"," All right."
"7843770","7846750"," CCL is moving up in the call world here."
"7847790","7850670"," Just posted the flow on CCL. "
"7850670","7856850"," I'll also post the current bullish and bearish flow in the market."
"7858310","7860990"," Like top 10 contenders or whatever they are."
"7917640","7922520"," Spy is trading down to on the simple moving average on the daily. "
"7922960","7929240"," Just trade it down to that 50 ma, which is that 457.68 mark."
"7929240","7935990"," Take a look and see if it settles down a little bit or if it trades lower."
"7962280","7964680"," Watching more ArkK puts coming in. "
"7964760","7966680"," This is the second set on ArkK."
"7967120","7973060"," January 28th, 76p for $143,000."
"7973740","7981820"," Total on ArkK puts right now on algo flow is $210,000. "
"7997270","8001270"," And ArkK did just break through its on its daily, right?"
"8001650","8003710"," Just broke through the 50 ma."
"8005310","8014050"," Price target below price targets below includes 79, 57, 78, 75, and 78, 19."
"8017130","8020070"," Just had some more dip buyers step in on spy. "
"8021010","8025430"," January 21, 461 C for $100,000."
"8026830","8029590"," And seeing some so-fi puts come in at this point."
"8030070","8033010"," I know some of you guys like so-fi out there, so I'll do so-fi next. "
"8038220","8041480"," And I'll take a look and see if you guys have been requesting tickers."
"8041920","8045000"," I'll take a look at the chat and see if we can pop some tickers up for you."
"8053870","8055530"," I'm going to turn this camera on too. "
"8056770","8060420"," All right, you guys got me now."
"8072880","8076640"," All right, so call out some tickers and I'll start checking some tickers for you."
"8084420","8090680"," So so-fi puts coming in $19,000, $15.5 is the target. "
"8097120","8102380"," And it looks like you have support at $15 flat and then down below at $14."
"8145990","8146450"," Snapplies."
"8151340","8151900"," Let's go. "
"8152020","8152820"," What's Josh saying?"
"8153020","8154200"," Not blaming him trying to hold him accountable."
"8154520","8158920"," The least you could do is actually talk about the place he endorsed yesterday to offer people any"
"8158920","8160840"," type of answer or guidance."
"8161760","8163960"," Okay, so I'm missing some of your comments here. "
"8166040","8166780"," Wait a minute."
"8168700","8170000"," Hold on, who is this?"
"8178900","8181700"," All right, so Josh, I just saw your comment."
"8181880","8183020"," Not blaming him trying to hold him accountable. "
"8183360","8186420"," The least you could do is actually talk about the place he endorsed yesterday to offer people any"
"8186420","8188080"," type of answer or guidance."
"8188740","8191040"," Can you give more words so that I can understand what you're trying to say?"
"8205809","8206530"," And Amazon."
"8207850","8210290"," All right, wait a minute. "
"8210410","8211370"," Where am I at in this feed?"
"8211730","8212809"," Hang tight one second here."
"8212870","8215450"," I'm trying to get through the comments here and figure some stuff out."
"8227400","8228160"," Hey, so let's go. "
"8228379","8229940"," You guys just hang tight for just one second."
"8231600","8233040"," What's going on with Josh?"
"8236379","8238900"," What is Josh saying that I endorsed yesterday?"
"8239400","8240160"," Where's Josh at?"
"8240879","8241860"," Bring Josh up here."
"8246690","8248490"," No, no, no, I want to ask a question. "
"8249830","8251129"," So you guys are out there right now."
"8251190","8252450"," I want to hear what Josh is saying."
"8254650","8258510"," Is that Josh saying that he waited until the bell to buy puts?"
"8264330","8265650"," Is that what Josh is saying?"
"8265670","8268090"," Is Josh like a bottom buyer and a top buyer?"
"8269350","8270030"," Is that what he is?"
"8272990","8274110"," Oh, okay, we can do that. "
"8274950","8275910"," Where's Josh at?"
"8276070","8276629"," Bring him Josh."
"8276629","8280850"," I didn't see any of your tweets there, Josh, or tower texts."
"8283660","8286219"," Yeah, okay, so let's talk about this real quick before we go any further. "
"8286420","8287680"," Okay, I'll bring a snap up."
"8289700","8291020"," Yeah, let's talk a little bit."
"8291280","8293400"," Okay, let's talk real quick here about this. "
"8296020","8296900"," Hang tight here."
"8296980","8297660"," I got to look at some stuff."
"8300660","8302299"," Let's have a little chat, okay?"
"8304600","8307059"," Let's talk about some stuff here, okay?"
"8308520","8309879"," Let's be very clear. "
"8310240","8312900"," Okay, this isn't about when you should or shouldn't buy either."
"8313680","8315780"," But we want to talk about some stuff, okay?"
"8317120","8320680"," Number one, let's talk about timing your trades."
"8321459","8326520"," Number two, let's talk about start watching the fucking feed in the morning. "
"8327879","8330260"," We talked about that we're going down, right?"
"8330480","8332219"," Did Josh buy puts yesterday in open?"
"8332799","8337540"," I want to fucking know, because I'm going to say right now that I guarantee he didn't."
"8338780","8339260"," Right?"
"8341020","8341680"," Did he?"
"8345400","8346100"," Did he?"
"8346320","8350400"," Who do we need to ban in here that can't buy fucking puts at the open yesterday?"
"8351400","8352780"," I mean, seriously."
"8356879","8359520"," How do you not buy fucking puts at the open yesterday?"
"8360120","8363139"," Did you not hear my one hour long fucking rant yesterday?"
"8364020","8365559"," Was that not a fucking enough?"
"8366139","8369500"," Or did you have to wait until 355 to buy puts?"
"8370820","8372219"," Let's go further with it. "
"8373320","8374680"," Let's go further with it."
"8375780","8381219"," Did you buy puts at the fucking close yesterday and then paper handed sell those bitches?"
"8381219","8383700"," Because what you think we're going up this morning?"
"8384620","8385740"," Is that what you think?"
"8386760","8390360"," Because we haven't traded above shit this morning at this point."
"8392900","8395860"," We haven't traded above nothing this morning. "
"8397100","8400920"," And there's nothing bullish about this market right now this morning."
"8402040","8404360"," No matter what you're fucking saying out there."
"8404960","8408700"," There ain't nothing bullish about this market this morning. "
"8410500","8414800"," So I want to know what fucking part of this market is bullish to you down here."
"8415260","8416820"," Do you see a V shape recovery?"
"8418560","8419600"," What question Josh?"
"8419900","8420860"," I haven't seen a question."
"8421420","8423220"," I've got like a, I've got like a 10. "
"8423420","8423980"," I've got like 10."
"8424560","8426940"," So in my chat box I can see 10."
"8428660","8429440"," 10 things. "
"8429880","8431440"," So I don't know what you're talking about here."
"8431860","8434380"," So you can come on in here and say what you want to say again."
"8434520","8434980"," I apologize. "
"8435640","8436580"," I haven't read what you read."
"8437780","8440660"," But I want to hear what you have to fucking say about it."
"8443160","8445800"," I want to fucking hear because you got to be joking. "
"8449720","8450780"," What's the real question?"
"8452500","8454580"," Does anybody know what Josh's question is?"
"8454720","8455940"," I'm being serious here."
"8456120","8459300"," Not trying to be, you know, a dick bag or anything or a fuck face."
"8459940","8464300"," I want to know what you're saying because all I'm seeing is last like 10 comments or so. "
"8464300","8468080"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, like 10 comments."
"8468200","8471180"," So anybody else wants to chitchat this up?"
"8474280","8474860"," What part?"
"8475080","8475680"," What part?"
"8476020","8477780"," What part do you not know that we're going?"
"8478140","8479760"," Last night I made a video late night."
"8480800","8485600"," Late night at 11 o'clock at fucking night I think or something where I told you we're looking to"
"8485600","8487020"," short this thing down again. "
"8496820","8498360"," So this is insane."
"8498920","8506920"," And furthermore, let's just say you did buy the clothes yesterday and you waited until 3.59 you"
"8506920","8507520"," bought puts."
"8508820","8511940"," You can hold those puts in the February 18th and buy calls. "
"8518340","8524420"," Yeah, I really want to know what the fuck is going on because if you're fucking up your trades"
"8524420","8525940"," here, it's easy to fix them."
"8529600","8533040"," I mean, shit, if anything, the market's been going down for how many days?"
"8537910","8541650"," Market's been going down since December 28th."
"8547090","8548630"," Yeah, I'm not pissed at you either. "
"8548850","8549490"," Don't hide or anything."
"8549810","8550430"," I like you."
"8550790","8551710"," Just talk to me. "
"8551770","8553110"," I want to hear what you have to say."
"8553630","8555170"," I didn't see what your question was."
"8555730","8557610"," Let me know what you want me to talk to you about. "
"8559910","8565990"," I realize that if you get angry or pissed off or whatever, did you buy zero date puts at the"
"8565990","8566650"," belly yesterday?"
"8586020","8586800"," I want to know."
"8590310","8592250"," So if you're looking for a target below, let me know."
"8592390","8594790"," Seriously, I'm not mad at Josh or anything either. "
"8594930","8596710"," I just want to know what's going on."
"8596850","8605400"," Any of you out there that are pissed off at this point, anyone that's pissed off,"
"8605480","8615330"," let you"
"8615330","8617870"," write insights on the 420, but yes, I can."
"8623000","8625540"," Okay, so let's talk about what Josh is asking then. "
"8628660","8631320"," There's a few things we have to discuss on the 428p."
"8631800","8632200"," Okay?"
"8633020","8637220"," First of all, the 428p is my target on the spy."
"8638080","8638380"," Okay?"
"8639140","8644440"," You have to still check and look to find out if that position is still valid. "
"8645000","8651480"," So you want to look at the actual options chain and find out if they're still in those 428p's."
"8651880","8655100"," You also want to know why they're placing those 428p's."
"8655460","8656160"," So let's take a look. "
"8656300","8657500"," I'll look on my trading platform."
"8672200","8675820"," So the 428p's for February 18th look like they're gone."
"8676340","8677960"," But guess what they are in right now?"
"8678120","8680120"," They switched over to 430p. "
"8680760","8687100"," So there's still 36,000 puts sitting at 430p for February 18th."
"8687100","8688640"," Take a look at it."
"8688940","8690100"," You can look it up on yourself. "
"8690820","8691980"," They're still out there."
"8692240","8701780"," They're currently at $3.09. There's nothing about this market this morning that's bullish."
"8703860","8706080"," There's no V shape recovery this morning. "
"8706260","8708300"," You can look at any options flow out there."
"8708740","8709140"," There's nothing."
"8709800","8712040"," There's two socks holding this market up this morning. "
"8712440","8713940"," It's Tesla and Misfit."
"8714180","8714660"," That's it."
"8723700","8724740"," There's a channel. "
"8724820","8727700"," If you look at a channel on the spy right now, right?"
"8728120","8730780"," We've been trading down in this channel since when?"
"8731100","8738320"," Since January 13th, since seven days ago, we've been in this channel."
"8743550","8750750"," You can also, when you've got those 428p's that come in after the bell, will still come home to"
"8750750","8751170"," roost."
"8751170","8757390"," I haven't seen any other call flow that's hedging other than Misfit and Tesla this morning. "
"8758070","8760210"," I haven't seen any Apple call flow that's been hedging."
"8760330","8760890"," No Netflix."
"8761610","8763110"," I haven't been seeing anything in spy. "
"8763630","8767330"," I haven't seen 20, 30 million dollars in the spy this morning or the cues."
"8768070","8768710"," None of that."
"8769230","8772090"," So the point is still valid. "
"8772330","8775110"," There's nothing here that's saying that we're bullish."
"8775590","8777270"," If you want to say, hey, we're bullish?"
"8777270","8777690"," Sure."
"8778530","8784790"," If we break through 460 and hold it into the close, we're bullish on ready on a daily, but not"
"8784790","8785090"," a weekly. "
"8786050","8790490"," We still have the largest call delta expiration in history."
"8790650","8793530"," I think it is history, expiring on Friday."
"8794350","8799910"," I know that last month on Thursday, we traded higher right on last OPEC's. "
"8800410","8802550"," Then we gave it all back heading into Friday."
"8802550","8804790"," We talked about that all week long."
"8819260","8822400"," You don't have to revolve, revoke Josh's haul pass. "
"8822920","8824560"," Josh just bringing up valid points."
"8824600","8827660"," He wants to know about is the 428 still in play?"
"8828320","8834840"," Well, from what I can see, there's still, you know, 10 million dollars sitting on that strike on"
"8834840","8836080"," February 18th."
"8836260","8837840"," I'm going to follow the guy with the money. "
"8837840","8844500"," I don't know what else to say on that."
"8844960","8850780"," You can still hold those puts and you can buy calls to offset your trading strategy and how you"
"8850780","8852560"," offset yesterday into the close."
"8852780","8854080"," What did I say to you in the close yesterday?"
"8854660","8856800"," You can go back to the recording that I made yesterday. "
"8857400","8859200"," And what did I say to you as a bear yesterday?"
"8860220","8861440"," Does anybody remember what I said?"
"8863720","8865800"," What did I say to bears yesterday?"
"8866460","8869980"," You should always be buying 10 cent calls as a hedge."
"8870820","8872020"," That's what I said yesterday."
"8872860","8875080"," Did you decide not to listen to that part of it?"
"8877220","8878400"," You just say, fuck it. "
"8878460","8881420"," I'm going all balls deep and puts at the bell."
"8881820","8883420"," And I'm not going to buy any kind of a call hedge."
"8884040","8889400"," I think it went on a rant for 15 minutes yesterday saying, this is how you hedge as a bear. "
"8889880","8891600"," I say it to bulls all the time."
"8895890","8897330"," Is there no echo in that?"
"8902180","8909500"," I talked to Joe Donut off microphone yesterday and I said to him, I want to buy my calls down"
"8909500","8909980"," here."
"8910540","8915200"," I want to buy my puts slightly higher and straddle the market into Monday. "
"8915560","8918340"," That was off microphone on a phone call yesterday."
"8921420","8922340"," Sorry, I'll be quiet."
"8924900","8926160"," I'll be quiet at this point. "
"8926240","8927060"," I'll stop getting fiery."
"8933270","8935330"," And the last point on this is this."
"8936090","8938850"," So now we've got someone here that's what bullish?"
"8939130","8939970"," Where are you bullish to?"
"8940590","8941590"," Do you think we're going to 480?"
"8942230","8943290"," Do you think we're going to 500?"
"8950620","8952520"," Sorry, I wasn't reading the comments earlier. "
"8961340","8962620"," Is my camera frozen?"
"8962620","8964260"," Oh, god damn it."
"8970120","8971200"," Alright, fuck my camera."
"8975000","8977600"," Yeah, my camera's been acting up the past couple days. "
"8978780","8980680"," And I just read something about it."
"8980700","8981260"," I got to figure something."
"8981440","8982660"," It's the camera itself, I think. "
"8984560","8985660"," The feed is fine."
"8991180","8994840"," You have to be able to hedge yourself on both the bull and bear side."
"8995280","8999920"," If you're picking up puts that are expensive, we already know that puts only pay one to one"
"8999920","9000340"," typically. "
"9001120","9003460"," We also know that you have to hold your puts, right?"
"9003660","9005140"," Like diamond hand them until the end."
"9005640","9006200"," You know that."
"9006300","9007360"," You have to hold on to them. "
"9007860","9012620"," You also know that at certain points you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be buying puts at the bottom"
"9012620","9015940"," because 10 million or 20 million comes in on them."
"9016920","9019000"," You saw me post them on Twitter."
"9019460","9024940"," It's not like I'm just saying to you, hey, there's $30 million in puts on IWM out there. "
"9026420","9028820"," You have to take risk out in this market."
"9029080","9034400"," If you start to put the pieces together, do you want to follow some guy, some retail guy that says"
"9034400","9039240"," I bought 5 grand in puts or do you want to follow a bank that says I bought 20 million"
"9039240","9043020"," in puts or 30 million in puts or 40 million in puts."
"9043920","9044920"," Where's the better trade?"
"9045560","9049140"," With some guy telling you, hey, I'm a retail guy and I bought 5 grand in puts. "
"9049320","9051780"," No, you want to follow the banks and where they're putting their money."
"9053920","9056100"," That's where they put their money yesterday into the close."
"9056540","9058300"," They're still in those puts at this point. "
"9058840","9064580"," If you're taking damage to your account, you have to be able to at least hedge with some calls as"
"9064580","9067540"," a bear or even hedge today with some calls as a bear."
"9069940","9074400"," You can make money to offset the price of the put position that you're in."
"9077300","9078340"," Timing is critical. "
"9079560","9082560"," Nobody wants to buy puts at 460, do they right now?"
"9084060","9085780"," Does anybody want to buy puts here at 460?"
"9086520","9086820"," No."
"9087480","9089900"," Because we got people thinking we're going to 470, right?"
"9090100","9091280"," 475, 480."
"9092580","9093600"," Because it's difficult. "
"9094500","9096080"," Do you know where it's easy to buy puts today?"
"9096620","9100800"," When we're down at 440 or 450 or 455, that feels great."
"9101520","9102820"," That's what the mind says to you."
"9103280","9107540"," The mind says to you, this feels better even though you're supposed to be buying them when it"
"9107540","9108360"," doesn't feel better. "
"9111320","9115580"," If you enter into some put hedges right now, right, we're on this downward slope."
"9115580","9118560"," There's a fair chance that those are going to print if they're in the money."
"9119220","9126140"," If we trade higher to 465 or 470 or 475, you can just go all in with zero dates. "
"9126800","9128360"," We talked about that the open yesterday, right?"
"9130800","9133960"," It doesn't feel comfortable when you're buying puts at a top."
"9134400","9139260"," It doesn't feel comfortable buying calls at a bottom, even if it's localized for a day or two."
"9144340","9146900"," Nothing about this market right now says we're along. "
"9147400","9147660"," Nothing."
"9147820","9154520"," There's no we have we have FOMC coming up on the 26th in six days."
"9155100","9164440"," Are you telling me that you think we're going to 480 or 470 or even 465 into FOMC?"
"9165300","9166480"," I'll take that bet. "
"9167100","9170440"," I'll take that risk that every trader has to take."
"9171160","9173180"," I'll take the risk that we're not going to be there."
"9174120","9175700"," I don't think we'll be at 465. "
"9176880","9180440"," I don't think we'll be at 470 into FOMC."
"9183080","9187280"," We're talking about rates, talking about increased tapering."
"9188220","9190580"," What kind of risk are you actually looking to put on?"
"9192040","9196920"," If there was a time to put risk on, I would assume that, especially on a bear trade, I'm going"
"9196920","9198020"," to assume that it's right now. "
"9204910","9214030"," If there's a time right now for let's say spy or QQQs the entire year, how about going back to"
"9214030","9215170"," April, May 2020?"
"9215730","9225660"," If there was a time to put some risk on as a bear, look back from now into March of"
"9225660","9226040"," 2020."
"9227500","9231000"," If there was a time to put some risk on as a bear, do you think it's now or do"
"9231000","9233800"," you think there's a better time between the past two years?"
"9235560","9236540"," I'm going to tell you no."
"9236820","9238960"," Right now is the best time to turn bearish. "
"9240880","9244560"," Do you think right now is the time to be bought going long in Apple for the rest of the"
"9244560","9244720"," year?"
"9245340","9248840"," Do you think this is the bottom for 2022?"
"9250160","9251160"," I'm going to say no."
"9254300","9257100"," How many times have I talked about golden tickets?"
"9257800","9262040"," How many times have I talked about golden tickets that I've said to you, wait for a dip to buy"
"9262040","9262680"," golden tickets?"
"9262680","9264140"," Ad nauseam."
"9264300","9265960"," Talk about ad nauseam out there. "
"9267360","9268240"," Ad nauseam."
"9268480","9270460"," How many times about golden tickets do I tell you?"
"9271000","9274180"," Get them slightly more in the money and put a little bit more time on them."
"9274800","9276360"," Ad nauseam, I talk about that. "
"9277540","9278420"," Ad nauseam."
"9293190","9294030"," Ad nauseam."
"9294150","9296610"," Two, three weeks ago we talked about putting put hedges on, right?"
"9297050","9298590"," We've been talking about them for three weeks now. "
"9298590","9311490"," You now"
"9311490","9315510"," have sellers consuming buyers on spy."
"9316510","9320070"," You've got more sellers entering the market right now on the spy."
"9330640","9335940"," You can see since 11 a.m. the hero indicator is going down, although it is showing up. "
"9367060","9368180"," I'm not pissed at Joe."
"9368380","9370300"," I don't want you to get pissed at him either."
"9370780","9372000"," I can understand frustration. "
"9372860","9373720"," I can understand fear."
"9374000","9374800"," I've been there myself."
"9374800","9380120"," You know, I started buying calls yesterday and they went down a ton. "
"9380620","9383720"," I think they were down 50% at one point into the bell."
"9387500","9389080"," And they printed green today."
"9390320","9392080"," So I have to manage my own trade, right?"
"9392780","9397680"," I have to manage what I'm in myself. "
"9398600","9400800"," Do I come on here and tell you that I win every trade?"
"9401300","9405380"," How many times do I tell you guys, hey, I fucked up a trade or I burned a trade down?"
"9406960","9408620"," 20, 30% of the time at least."
"9412540","9415060"," I know some of you guys have been sticking around since day one."
"9415340","9418720"," I know some of you hear me all the time say, I burned this trade down. "
"9419520","9423740"," Do I tell any of you out there that I only won this trade, or all I do is win"
"9423740","9424000"," trades?"
"9424760","9424920"," Never."
"9445720","9447260"," Yeah, we can stick a look at queues definitely."
"9450400","9451760"," Sorry, I don't mean to go on a rant turning. "
"9451940","9453340"," I missed most of what was talked about."
"9456220","9457740"," And I can understand frustration."
"9460340","9461120"," I get frustrated. "
"9462160","9462740"," I get scared."
"9463880","9464380"," I get panicked."
"9490540","9494440"," Timing your own trades, managing your own risk, managing your own fares. "
"9495360","9495860"," It's hard."
"9496020","9496520"," It's not easy."
"9499000","9502780"," If you're in February 18 puts, I mean shit. "
"9504180","9506200"," It's January 20th."
"9518380","9519540"," I'm looking for like 400."
"9520860","9523480"," I'm actually looking for like 400 by March. "
"9524240","9525800"," I want to see deeper than 428."
"9529340","9531420"," I don't want to buy this market right here at 450."
"9532100","9533200"," I don't want to fucking buy it. "
"9533360","9534220"," I don't want to buy it at 450."
"9534980","9536000"," I don't want to buy it at 480."
"9538040","9538960"," I want to be safe. "
"9539620","9540000"," I'm a bull."
"9541160","9547040"," Do you think I want to buy this market at 350 or four, excuse me, four at 455?"
"9548360","9548900"," Hell no."
"9550520","9553780"," You got banks telling us you're only going to be up 6% this year. "
"9554180","9556020"," You get some banks saying we're going to be right on the year."
"9556300","9560040"," You get some bank, like maybe one or two saying we'll be up 9% this year."
"9561300","9565480"," I have absolutely no want to take this market long if we're not going to sell down to like 400. "
"9566240","9573240"," I want us to trade back up to 450, 500, 505, maybe tag 500 at Christmas next year."
"9574420","9575740"," We got rates coming in."
"9575840","9578340"," You got Jamie Diamond saying we're getting seven rate increases. "
"9579480","9580300"," Hoping for that."
"9581180","9583320"," We've priced in three to four rate increases."
"9583580","9585840"," We've got the Fed coming out. "
"9586000","9589660"," If the Fed says we were getting seven rate increases, do you know what's going to happen?"
"9592720","9594400"," They come out and say some shit like that."
"9594740","9597160"," This market's going to sell the F down."
"9600000","9601580"," It's going to sell down to the pits of hell. "
"9602580","9603560"," That's what's going to happen."
"9604120","9606980"," You see the President come out yesterday and try to ease everybody's opinion?"
"9607460","9607760"," No."
"9614440","9615960"," We've got some weakness down below. "
"9616100","9619160"," We've got more buyers stepping in on the queues."
"9620040","9627060"," Looks like some support here at 371.83. You know firm supports down here at 365, 30, 39."
"9631040","9639300"," If your long puts into February 18th, you can always go long and calls on zero dates to offset the"
"9639300","9640100"," cost of those puts. "
"9640820","9642160"," You get a piece of paper or notebook."
"9642720","9644520"," You write down what I bought the puts at."
"9644520","9647380"," Let's say you bought puts in five bucks a piece, right?"
"9647560","9649120"," Let's say they're now worth $3 a piece. "
"9650400","9653260"," You say I got to make $2 for $2 back on the other side of this."
"9656650","9661210"," I mean shit for the entire past two weeks, what have we talked about?"
"9661910","9663070"," Putback spreads, right?"
"9663730","9664910"," Post it about it on Twitter."
"9665770","9666770"," Talked about it here. "
"9668790","9676050"," You're selling two puts above that are in the money and you're buying a put below outside the"
"9676050","9676250"," money."
"9679010","9681750"," You can still make that trade with what you've got."
"9682410","9686690"," You've got outside the money puts right now that you bought for February 18th. "
"9687830","9689090"," You want to protect yourself?"
"9689510","9694470"," You just sell two in the money puts, and that'll actually pay for your trade."
"9696830","9699350"," So how you structure your trades isn't on me."
"9710190","9715470"," And even my own trading strategy on how I'm trading this down is a straddle. "
"9715730","9720010"," I talked to yesterday about that I'm going to straddle this market on the put-in call side."
"9720770","9725090"," So you guys have to figure out how you're trading this market, how you're going to pay for your"
"9725090","9729050"," trades, how you hedge your trades."
"9729190","9730710"," You're talking about hedging around here all the time. "
"9731210","9731810"," So I'm done with this."
"9731890","9732810"," I'm going to stop talking about it."
"9747920","9754990"," All right, so we've got some more flow coming in. "
"9755190","9762550"," Peton, January 21st, 32 P, two times by 80,000 twice."
"9764990","9773390"," Kweb, two sets of puts, 35.42 P for February 18th."
"9774690","9783570"," We have the bulls stepping back in and they're buying S O X S, 56 C for $50,000, QQQ,"
"9783730","9787270"," 375 C for $122,000. "
"9788350","9795510"," Two more sets of S O X S calls, January 20th, 56, and 57 C."
"9798470","9802530"," Some puts coming in on Neo, January 21, 30 P."
"9804510","9814230"," If you want the downward sloping range on the spy, you're looking for"
"9814230","9819170"," 457.77 on the low end of the channel."
"9819610","9829110"," The high end of the channel is 466.19. In no way, shape or form have we broken the downward"
"9829110","9837390"," channel of spy and we won't break the downward channel of spy until we break above 466.29 or so."
"9838010","9840790"," That's roughly what the channel's been for the past month. "
"9843190","9847970"," Since 479.98 might be slightly higher."
"9848710","9849410"," Let me take a look at this."
"9850510","9852830"," Now that's right where it's at. "
"9852910","9854050"," It could go slightly higher here."
"9856070","9865490"," Call the top of the channel on the downward channel on spy 469.45. As long as that is not"
"9865490","9867830"," broken, we are still moving on down."
"9877180","9881960"," And we still as of yet have not broken above into that downward channel. "
"9882380","9884400"," We're actually still below at this point."
"9885320","9887960"," The downward sloping channel for the spy."
"9897780","9899900"," But right at the bottom of it, we can say, I guess. "
"9907190","9911710"," So if you if you're inputs right now and you're saying, well, you know, I don't want to I don't"
"9911710","9913530"," think we're going down to 428 now."
"9913530","9915310"," I think we're going to 480 or 500."
"9915310","9916150"," I just turned bull. "
"9917030","9919610"," You could say to yourself, I guess you're bullish, right?"
"9919750","9922570"," You're bullish into FOMC, I'm assuming."
"9923570","9926110"," FOMC is next Wednesday."
"9927470","9929110"," So you're super bullish now, right?"
"9929830","9931730"," So we'll take look at 426. "
"9932690","9936470"," I'm assuming that we can probably look at 426, 460 C's."
"9937310","9938310"," 466, right?"
"9938750","9939950"," 426, January 26."
"9943260","9952480"," The 466 C for next next Wednesday is $1.09. Super cheap. "
"9953040","9957040"," If you're really hella bullish, probably try up to 470 in TAFOMC."
"9957680","9959860"," Those calls are 41 cents."
"9960480","9961020"," Those are dirt cheap. "
"9963710","9968470"," I just do want to warn you that there's a bunch of puts on the Wednesday of 26th on January."
"9974400","9981440"," If you're super duper uber bullish heading north from here, 480 C spiring on Wednesday."
"9982440","9985880"," Seeing as the outlook has gotten so bullish, 480s are only 4 cents. "
"9986880","9988220"," 475s are only 11 cents."
"9988780","9991100"," Dirt cheap for the uber bull out there."
"9992840","9994700"," The person that thinks we're trading higher. "
"10015090","10020430"," We're coming into that resistance, though, and that we talked about on the spy here earlier this"
"10020430","10022550"," morning, 458 72."
"10023830","10027110"," Looks like they're coming up around 458 60."
"10027850","10030710"," If we break above this resistance at 460. "
"10032950","10038870"," It's weird too because I'm not seeing the shadow, the eyes shadow, unless I squeeze it down here."
"10039970","10049590"," I want you to see this above because it's not showing up."
"10049590","10057720"," But there are sellers hiding above here 458 60. "
"10060280","10062020"," 458 52."
"10063860","10073460"," We are showing more sellers on the CVD at this moment."
"10074800","10079980"," This is a key area right here. "
"10083830","10088190"," USO calls coming in to 1862 C."
"10106970","10111030"," My assumption at this point is that bears are going to lean in here."
"10111450","10113070"," You will see bears lean in."
"10113150","10115530"," This would be the first spot for bears to lean in. "
"10116050","10121650"," If the bears cannot lean in and take this down lower, you are going to look."
"10121850","10125530"," I'll give you some marks above as we trade higher if we break through 460."
"10148010","10154010"," I'm going to leave book map up somewhere in here so you can watch and see if we break above"
"10154010","10156130"," by this ice right here. "
"10156270","10157810"," Just so you guys can see where it's at."
"10158630","10165870"," Normally, I like to get a little bit closer here, but we really want to see these sellers disappear"
"10165870","10169290"," to pick this trade back up again if you're bullish."
"10169290","10177230"," You want to wait for a rip above 459 10 looks like the sellers came down. "
"10177470","10181530"," They started out above here around 459 90 somewhere in this area."
"10181970","10187490"," They've since moved down to meet up with the bulls here at 458 56."
"10574140","10579100"," Sorry I was I was taking aside from the Mike for a minute. "
"10579540","10581040"," I'm not at lunch right now."
"10581040","10582620"," I just muted it for a moment."
"10583200","10584680"," I had to take a business call. "
"10586600","10588800"," So I put Tesla back up again for you guys."
"10588920","10590420"," Got any more tickers I can put up for you."
"10599630","10604470"," You got guidables JD now and gap in a gap up on daily 82 50. "
"10605130","10608230"," I'm going to put the we say nothing's changed here in Tesla."
"10608750","10611670"," By the way, this is the no ditto in the middle right on Tesla."
"10611990","10613270"," You should have taken the trade right at the bell. "
"10614410","10616350"," There's a little bit of support down here 1028."
"10616350","10619430"," We know that the real buyers are still below at 1000."
"10624530","10625130"," All right. "
"10625350","10627330"," So I'll do I'll do JD first."
"10629150","10631150"," We know where the trade is on Tesla, right?"
"10631350","10632490"," Nothing's changed from this morning."
"10636520","10640080"," And then I'm going to mute real quick and I'm going to start pumping out tickers for you guys. "
"10640760","10641940"," So I'll do JD first."
"10690300","10690940"," All right."
"10690960","10692720"," So let's look at an intraday chart real quick. "
"10692720","10696660"," So before I get any further on J, I'm going to bring JD up here, but I just saw someone"
"10696660","10697640"," say a question."
"10698460","10701460"," I got spy puts at today's high thoughts."
"10701580","10704480"," Short term debating taking profits is smart expiry. "
"10704680","10705280"," Just a short trade."
"10706820","10708600"," So we're in what looks like."
"10709060","10713720"," Oh JD dirty dog dirty dog JD. "
"10714020","10714800"," Look at that smashing."
"10717600","10719520"," Gorgeous looking chart huh on JD."
"10721640","10723940"," I started $85 on JD. "
"10725620","10730260"," Now we're in a we're in a wedge right now on the spy, right?"
"10734450","10741830"," There's a fair chance that the spy trades down to 456.29 possibly not not guaranteed, but it is in"
"10741830","10742990"," a bullish kind of a wedge."
"10742990","10750770"," So if we trade down here to 456.45 could be a nice spike up again at some point, but"
"10750770","10753370"," the spy is becoming more bullish at this point."
"10754590","10758210"," Just be conscious of that if you're in spy or if you in spy puts right now. "
"10761090","10765330"," JD just smashing around more buyers and sellers here indicator is positive."
"10765530","10768790"," If I see any JD puts, I'll let you know."
"10772080","10774840"," Watching more Hertz calls coming in 25C. "
"10775220","10777120"," Spiring February 18th."
"10777480","10780900"," Then I'm also watching some calls coming in on some of you guys like DWAC."
"10781460","10785760"," January 21 95C on DWAC. "
"10896090","10896790"," Hold on."
"10897270","10902370"," All right, so taking a quick look at Apple price target above, right?"
"10902690","10907010"," Large resistance above between 180 and 185 sitting on some firm support down here."
"10907010","10908930"," 165, 160, 150. "
"10910150","10912330"," Hero indicator has more sellers than buyers."
"10913070","10915370"," Hero indicator is negative on Apple at this point."
"11036620","11042740"," All right, so Amazon's coming down into some daily intraday support at 31.20. We know that the"
"11042740","11044240"," banks are down here at 3100. "
"11045120","11047960"," I did just see some calls come in."
"11049910","11050570"," JPLI."
"11051770","11056490"," January 20th, $500,000 high algo score. "
"11057450","11064650"," I also saw a decent algo score on JPM January 20th, 190C."
"11064950","11066850"," XLI for half million dollars."
"11067590","11069110"," January 20th, 105. "
"11069890","11072810"," And then JPM, 120, 190C."
"11135340","11138940"," More sellers on PayPal, 305 to 287."
"11139340","11142620"," Hero indicator, though, is very bullish on PayPal right now. "
"11143660","11145800"," Do you want a place to take it to?"
"11150430","11152850"," You know that PayPal is being shorted heavily."
"11153090","11157150"," I like PayPal trade into the first of the year."
"11157230","11159210"," I just don't know when it will rip higher, if it will. "
"11159410","11159510"," It is."
"11159790","11167110"," We looked at that spreadsheet of tickers that could possibly have shorts lifted at some point."
"11185190","11186710"," Give me just a second, guys. "
"11186850","11188510"," It's tough for me to get through all the comments."
"11189630","11193110"," I have to, uh, back in the summer, someone dropped nine milli on SC."
"11193370","11194150"," I'll do SC next. "
"11194730","11196050"," I apologize for the time."
"11196230","11196890"," Hot for you."
"11197150","11201330"," But I haven't, I haven't seen a star, a sad face when I scrolled back up to PayPal. "
"11201710","11202750"," I'm going to do SC next."
"11203990","11205390"," And then as I move down."
"11208810","11210650"," I did nice show a F.R. earlier. "
"11211750","11218590"," I do forward possibly say, so far as that, uh, 19.26% HSI is flying."
"11218970","11220310"," All the Chinese names are flying."
"11222090","11223090"," Hotch, what did you want me to?"
"11223270","11224990"," Hotch, what did you want me to take a look at, brother?"
"11241650","11244310"," Hotch, can you just post whatever you want me to post for you?"
"11245390","11247350"," Because I'm getting buried in comments here. "
"11251120","11252440"," Good morning, just some guy."
"11252660","11252980"," How are you?"
"11256020","11258460"," Sorry, the chat is flying by right here."
"11258980","11262860"," I have a difficult time because I'm trying to work for my own trades. "
"11263060","11266980"," I'm trying to do the, the charting and then, uh, working on the feed."
"11268100","11270500"," And then I have having a side conversation here as well."
"11275120","11281000"," I like the SC chart. "
"11281220","11283520"," You're blasting through resistance above here."
"11284420","11291740"," Intraday buyers at 176.89. No heroin indicator for this chart, but you do have more buyers than"
"11291740","11292000"," sellers."
"11292700","11294760"," I do like how I used to trade SCL. "
"11295000","11296280"," I used to love trading this ticker."
"11298120","11299100"," Hotch, are you still there?"
"11300400","11301360"," Yeah, we brought it."
"11301380","11302840"," I'll do a F.R.M. right now for you. "
"11306000","11311500"," And then I called out some AFR, AFRM, um, Uber calls this morning, right?"
"11313960","11318960"," Uber bullish calls in the F.R.M. D.W.A.C. How to Uber bullish calls that we called"
"11318960","11319980"," out earlier this morning."
"11336290","11337250"," Hey, welcome GP."
"11337610","11337890"," What did I do?"
"11338010","11338890"," Did I do something for you?"
"11339770","11342350"," Look at a F.R.M. AFRM real quick. "
"11345650","11350150"," Day traders paradise and AFRM tick typically on both the long and short side."
"11350150","11351470"," There's a lot like Q-com."
"11352890","11354430"," AFRM trades a lot like Q-com. "
"11362150","11364190"," I already showed MSFT, didn't I?"
"11364350","11366230"," I swear I showed MSFT as well."
"11371380","11377720"," Yeah, Chase, I saw that bullish descending triangle on the spy as well."
"11378840","11381740"," There should be a little bit of a capitulation move down. "
"11381940","11382700"," It might not happen."
"11382840","11385100"," We could break above before we got there."
"11385100","11388660"," We've got a lower low here down at the 11.45. We had a low. "
"11389260","11390580"," We have a higher low."
"11391040","11392260"," It looks like the number two, right?"
"11392600","11396520"," One, two, a break above and sit back down on top of the triangle."
"11398280","11403700"," Or we could pitch late down and bounce off of 4.56.34 or so. "
"11403800","11404480"," It's somewhere in there."
"11405820","11411660"," We could pitch late down and bounce off the daily one minute 200."
"11412960","11416860"," That's at 4.56.46 and then rocket ship higher. "
"11417940","11422700"," So if you are in zero-date puts, you're going to be hoping for us to trade down to this"
"11422700","11429080"," 4.56.49. Take your profit and run unless you think we're going to break through this triangle."
"11429560","11435520"," This triangle does look pretty bullish though, but you're probably waiting for a capitulation move"
"11435520","11444900"," down to 4.56. On the bull's side of that trade, it is possible that we hold right here and"
"11444900","11446000"," just blast through that triangle."
"11446140","11448160"," Just be conscious of it on the intraday chart. "
"11448660","11454880"," I can see right now for sure that your day traders are going to be looking for this move."
"11455900","11457880"," Day traders are going to be looking for this move down."
"11458380","11463080"," You're going to want to buy the dip at maybe a little bit more accurate here. "
"11466180","11470480"," Somewhere down here at 4.56.43 and then take it long."
"11472260","11474620"," So look for a capitulation move in the spy real quick."
"11475600","11476660"," Hey man, where's Hutch?"
"11477220","11477660"," Touch this trade?"
"11478420","11480040"," We want to 1 p.m. sell off. "
"11482360","11482840"," Hutch."
"11483720","11484740"," Are you alive?"
"11488720","11492020"," Chase is saying he misses the days we break below 450 again."
"11492060","11492820"," I missed those days. "
"11493440","11495940"," Shit's been going on for the past 20 days."
"11498220","11500540"," All right, so AFRM you guys can see it right."
"11500760","11501380"," Sell the rip at 70. "
"11501640","11502640"," Pick it back up at 60."
"11508590","11509710"," Premium burn, baby."
"11510430","11511850"," What else did you guys want me to do?"
"11511990","11512870"," What are the tickers?"
"11513050","11513910"," I saw some MSFT. "
"11514770","11515970"," I'll put that one up for you."
"11518250","11532260"," We're going to look briefly after MSFT for a bounce here"
"11532260","11532700"," in the spy."
"11533880","11539840"," Let's see if we can get some 4.56.05 is down here. "
"11541740","11546760"," I don't see buyers down here."
"11546820","11547980"," It looks like buyers are higher."
"11555770","11557030"," You might not get that dip. "
"11559640","11561880"," Keep your eyes on the buyers and sellers here."
"11563700","11567420"," Hero indicator looks like the bulls are stepping it back up for another try higher."
"11579140","11581520"," Have a dip going on an MSFT. "
"11582020","11585320"," I'm assuming you should be able to just watch the spy to pick your trades."
"11586080","11591160"," You know that the banks are down here at 305 on MSFT, right?"
"11591300","11592260"," This is kind of no man's land."
"11593140","11595180"," Your price target is 315. "
"11595180","11604320"," You know you have turbulence at 312, a little bit of 311.46. Turbulence at 313.94 and 312.97."
"11605880","11610420"," I think earlier when we're getting up on the spy, I told you to wait for a break above, right?"
"11611680","11618020"," You want to be looking for that break above 4.59. That if you're bullish into that number, that you"
"11618020","11624160"," take profit, you allow the banks to do the work for you to get it above that resistance zone."
"11626580","11632240"," Until that happens, and right now, in all honesty, at a larger scale, we are finding resistance,"
"11632240","11632820"," right?"
"11632980","11642920"," We're finding resistance at 458, 4.59. You know that the banks are down below here at 305, at least"
"11642920","11643900"," on the intraday."
"11646400","11647200"," What am I missing?"
"11648340","11651600"," Sand is saying that the VIX is curling up on the 10 minute watch out. "
"11652220","11654480"," Yeah, there's a chance that we trade down here for sure."
"11659990","11662070"," Yeah, Benjamin's saying he smells burning premiums."
"11668180","11670120"," Yeah, JPM 190C. "
"11670320","11671460"," JPM call is kind of weird."
"11672380","11674960"," I'm seeing like XLI calls, weird calls out there."
"11675460","11679620"," Like I'm seeing JPM 190C for January 20th. "
"11680680","11683320"," Sometimes, you know, when we have a good report, I do want to mention this."
"11684140","11686180"," I'm seeing more Hertz calls again."
"11686740","11691560"," Hertz, 218, 22.5C. I'm seeing some calls on X."
"11692460","11694180"," I'm seeing some calls on big ones. "
"11695020","11700340"," February 18th, 60C on EXC, $277,000."
"11700740","11704120"," That's a big block for a $60 price tag call."
"11705240","11706020"," Now I'm seeing. "
"11706820","11708240"," Yeah, I'll call you back later."
"11708460","11708680"," Sorry."
"11713340","11715440"," So one thing about the bank. "
"11716100","11717140"," We'll look at JPM."
"11717360","11718720"," One thing about the banks, right?"
"11718980","11720920"," We were talking about this the other day again, right?"
"11721120","11725160"," Another thing we're talking about is we're talking about Citigroup or GS, right?"
"11726600","11731560"," GS supposedly didn't hit their price target because some analysts that tells you they should have"
"11731560","11732900"," made an extra billion or so."
"11734400","11736160"," And so they sell it down, right?"
"11736320","11737720"," They sell GS down. "
"11737720","11739740"," They sell it sold Citigroup down."
"11740200","11742800"," And they tell you boo, boo, boo, bad, bad, bad."
"11743440","11746660"," And it's not surprising to see, you know, you have to take the put spreads. "
"11747060","11747860"," Those print out."
"11748540","11752260"," And then Shocker, they raise up the price of banks down the road, right?"
"11752360","11752980"," A week, two later."
"11753780","11754240"," They beat them. "
"11754360","11755720"," They burn out the first expiry."
"11756340","11757700"," And then the second expiry."
"11757860","11759480"," They actually raise it back up again. "
"11760260","11762120"," So it's kind of like beating out your own game."
"11767720","11770580"," And then you're going to go to the GS down or Y is Citigroup down."
"11779340","11782500"," So if you're going to follow that JPM trade, where would you follow that?"
"11784020","11784900"," 148-12. "
"11788120","11789700"," Do I think it'll print 190?"
"11790100","11790600"," Fuck no."
"11791080","11794980"," You're probably just looking for a print that's going to print, you know, 100% of whatever that"
"11794980","11795500"," trade is."
"11795740","11797860"," Maybe it needs to just go to 151-152. "
"11799460","11801500"," We can look a little bit deeper into it and see it."
"11805050","11811050"," why they took that trade this looks like firm support doesn't it on JPM only danger in this right"
"11811050","11816750"," is if the market crashes not crashes but if we continue on this correction there's nothing stopping"
"11816750","11824370"," JPM from coming down that's a pretty pretty dangerous trade without a doubt assuming that they're"
"11824370","11830090"," not they're seeing blue skies above that would be the implication this is a dangerous trade without"
"11830090","11839550"," a doubt watching some light cues puts coming in January"
"11839550","11850720"," 21st 368 P only $75,000 you've got"
"11850720","11855520"," some people taking the other side of that trade here on this wedge they want to see the wedge fail"
"11855520","11864260"," even if it's only briefly now seeing more puts coming on the spy was January 21st 456 P for $102 "
"11864260","11870800",",000 there's some anticipation sometimes these wedges they'll break down there's some capitulation"
"11870800","11875440"," swing below the wedge and then you take it and end up taking it higher for another stab at 460"
"11875440","11883930"," wouldn't shock me to see another stab at it later this afternoon and if we do break that wedge you"
"11883930","11890650"," are gonna see bull or bears step it in force this is the first area for the market to get"
"11890650","11895970"," bearish once more you know bears have been making money for a month now they've got a lot of"
"11895970","11900390"," ammunition and they're just waiting for that moments where they feel as though bulls will"
"11900390","11908670"," capitulate where bulls will get scared where they don't have any more ammo where they get afraid as"
"11908670","11915070"," we you know the runway is running out too we know that spot gamma said that we have the largest"
"11915070","11924510"," call delta in some time rolling off on Friday so if that call delta that positive call delta does"
"11924510","11932510"," not get replaced on Friday Monday or Tuesday or so if you don't see big call hedge walls coming in"
"11932510","11940270"," we go down that's that's what happens if you don't see those 480s be replaced if you don't see any"
"11940270","11945970"," of that stuff supposedly Carl Eichen has replaced all that stuff at this point Carl Eichen is gonna"
"11945970","11954640"," hold the market up for us he does that from time to time on the downside to he provides liquidity"
"11954640","11960780"," for the market when people really want to be buying puts any but provides liquidity when people"
"11960780","11969390"," really want to be buying calls I want to warn you that the last time that Carl Eichen provided"
"11969390","11979090"," liquidity for the markets was let me look back and see now it finally came back into my mind I"
"11979090","11985770"," was like what was the last trade that Carl Eichen was on well when we were down here at on"
"11985770","11995510"," December 20th we didn't have liquidity for put buyers down at 4.5184"
"11995510","12004190"," which is pretty much where we are right now and when we were down here at 4.5184 he provided"
"12004190","12013790"," put liquidity for bears and we wound up going way higher 480 we tagged out a 4.7998"
"12013790","12023550"," he provided liquidity down here and if he provided liquidity before 80 yesterday someone was saying"
"12023550","12037660"," that earlier he's now doing the opposite side of that trade at the"
"12037660","12047060"," same spot that we were at last time so watching some some opposing flow on the spy we I just"
"12047060","12055980"," showed you they are told you about this spy January 21 4.56 P's for $102,000 someone also took"
"12055980","12070130"," the opposite side of that trade they took spy January 21 4.58 C for $92,000 yeah that"
"12070130","12080850"," JPM trade is definitely degenerate definitely degenerate trade you know it's"
"12080850","12089570"," weird I why you guys understand or realize that what does that mean David so guys like Carl Eichen"
"12089570","12095150"," don't ever want to lose the trade so basically what he's doing I don't know if it was a spread"
"12095150","12101350"," or what he did what exactly bought or sold or whatever but so what happened in the last time was"
"12101350","12109070"," we were down we were down here on December 20th right everybody knew the world was burning then"
"12109070","12118670"," we're down here at 451 and we didn't have and there were no puts available to buy so"
"12118670","12126090"," he pretty sold puts into the market he placed them for sale and a bunch of bears bought a bunch"
"12126090","12133770"," of puts down there hedge funds stuff like that and we didn't trade down from there right so he got"
"12133770","12138350"," to keep all of his money we traded higher he more than likely took the long side of that trade"
"12138350","12147490"," as well to hedge we traded higher to 480 so those four below four 50 puts never printed he kept"
"12147490","12152870"," his money he got the fees for loaning out his shares for that and then he made money on the"
"12152870","12161030"," long end and now we're down here at the same spot and people want to buy 480 calls so he's"
"12161030","12166570"," putting his stock up and saying I'm gonna sell you those 480s and those 470 calls in my opinion"
"12166570","12172310"," that's what he's doing and and we know we're not going there now I can be wrong on that there's"
"12172310","12177170"," you know other theories I'm sure out there I don't know who put that information out today was that"
"12177170","12182910"," some that did that or cham or whatever his name is chem I always pronounce his name wrong maybe he"
"12182910","12192720"," put that information out there you guys know who put that stuff up on there yeah because he did"
"12192720","12197400"," this the last time on the opposite side of the trade and that was that was some that put that"
"12197400","12201300"," up the last time he wouldn't say the name of the person that was doing it but we all know"
"12201300","12207260"," it was Carl I don't know how that popped back in my brain just now but I just remember that"

"12582560","12586240"," everybody's in on the calls I take the put side everybody's in on the puts I'll take the put side"

"12722160","12731990"," here you can see this area right here right it's kind of a weak weakness in the recovery"
"12731990","12741570"," rally okay you're gonna see if you see a V shaped recovery like this you'll literally see a move"
"12741570","12749590"," that's like 70 points or more by one o'clock in the afternoon that's how fast that move happens and"
"12749590","12759370"," typically will then trade slightly down into the close you'll see a shaped recovery that you're"
"12759370","12764950"," looking for normally it happens with a large hammer candle and normally with some with some serious"
"12764950","12772410"," capitulation like we had in the close yesterday we had some serious capitulation but you're looking"
"12772410","12778970"," for today by like 1 p.m. we should be up 70 handles if not more we should be ripping"

"13115900","13125710"," no there's nothing do I think we trade up there I do but you have to look at previous years"
"13125710","13134290"," when we have rates right we usually have a good year but there's always moments going back so I"
"13134290","13143490"," looked back to 1987 1986 I think I look back to and all those years that we had rates we"
"13143490","13149270"," had a positive year we were green that year when you look at the entire year together there was"
"13149270","13157250"," every single time we had rates raised that year we had a low of the year and it came some"
"13157250","13162210"," usually most of the time it comes between now and March there was one year I think we took until"
"13162210","13166830"," April for us to get there and another year it took us to get to June to get there but"
"13166830","13174670"," to buy this market you can't in safety buy this market until we trade down lower even if we trade"
"13174670","13183890"," up to to 520 at the end of the year or 550 at the end of the year and just"
"13183890","13188430"," look at it logically let's say we trade up let's say the let's say we go to 480 this week"
"13188430","13192850"," let's just say right we're like hey we're going to 480 this week we already know we predetermined"
"13192850","13199010"," it by time traveling just look at it from a logical point of view like think about this more"
"13199010","13206450"," logical point of view we are raising rates okay if you're positing that we're going to go to 520 or"
"13206450","13211870"," 480 let's say then your next positive is that we're going to trade up into the end of the year"
"13211870","13218650"," to what to is it to is it to 520 is it just another 400 points or 40 points spending"
"13218650","13223850"," how you count so if that's the case are you saying we're going to trade sideways from now into"
"13223850","13230390"," December how are you saying that we're going to trade down at some point this summer you just want"

"13235050","13238530"," money so you don't really care about the rest of the year so if you look at the rest of"
"13238530","13245010"," the year as a whole or are you positing that we're going to go to 560 or 600 by end"
"13245010","13249890"," of year so I want to know what your end of year thesis is right so when you say does"
"13249890","13255190"," it does it ruin my thesis at 428 no I think that I think that the chances of us going"
"13255190","13263970"," to 428 are greater before we go up to 520 or 550 or 560 I think the chances of us"
"13263970","13276920"," closing this year at 520 or high if we trade down to 428 440 easily I"
"13276920","13283680"," think that's an easy I think it's an easy target I think it's easy for bulls to get long if"
"13285960","13292460"," we get down to 440s 420s somewhere in there and I don't mind us even going straight to the moon"
"13292460","13298000"," this year I'm just saying that if you look at what's taking place in you've got rates being raised"

"13314400","13319680"," to 480 now then we're going to trade to what 500 520 by springtime and what are we doing through"

"13335330","13341150"," going up I see us being bullish this year but when I'm looking at where should I be bearish what"
"13341150","13350090"," time of the year should I be bearish it's right now into the tail end of ER season and probably"
"13350090","13355770"," after right into March I'm hoping that this happens now between now and March I don't have to wait"
"13355770","13364830"," until April and most years we have rates raised we do go up and we are positive but most of"
"13364830","13373050"," those years we have at least one to two capitulation moments of those years you can show me a year"
"13373050","13379130"," that we didn't I want to know the year that we raised rates and we didn't have a capitulation"

"17360250","17369110"," i like that trade i'm looking at it i'm looking at it right now on a moving average on a"
"17369110","17381350"," one-year chart my only issues on boot is what it's traded up to 135 bucks things"
"17381350","17390850"," been trading up since uh start right start of 2020 i don't know man my only question here on boot"
"17390850","17398130"," to be honest with you to give you an honest opinion on boot is even when a stock is bullish"
"17398130","17406250"," that at some point the banks want to take profit right so if the banks bought it down here at"
"17406250","17415690"," eight bucks and now they've made the 1200 profit it might trade up for er but my"
"17415690","17422550"," my thought process would be that it's you know time to take profit i think bank people don't"
"17422550","17427070"," understand not you but i know people don't understand i can see your point on where it is right now"
"17427070","17433950"," too because it's on the same slope and it's about to touch at 97 bucks right where it would"
"17433950","17440150"," normally be right i think that's your your question maybe you get a sweet trade out of it for er"
"17440150","17445130"," but i would like to see you know how when you trade and arrange and you have the upside of"
"17445130","17453060"," that range on the downside of that range that probably be a buyer of wait a minute"
"17453060","17464160"," like a long-term holder of boot i'd like to see it swing down to"
"17464160","17472920"," sixty five sixty eight dollars something like that somewhere in there sixty five dollars i know"
"17472920","17477880"," that's below the 200 on it but it has more to do with profit taking and less to do with"
"17477880","17483440"," if it's a good company or not that's tough trade that's time for that i thought it would be to"
"17483440","17492560"," look at on the chart so even if they make up bullshit news negative news or whatever i like the"
"17492560","17500840"," buy once it hits 70 bucks though it wouldn't shock me to see buyers step in at 93 or even"
"17500840","17507260"," currently where it's at for a trade in t-e-r but i would still expect to sell on it"
"17507260","17515280"," let's say it does run up t-e-r you're still going to see a sell-off on it once"
"17515280","17520820"," it hits like 119 or so and just pure profit taking i don't think it's any negative to say about"
"17520820","17526840"," this company at all but you know it's outside of its channel it's traded outside of its channel it"
"17526840","17533780"," should come back into its channel at some point i would rather take the long-term like june six put"
"17533780","17543720"," on it down to like 75 bucks let"
"17551370","17556750"," me go back up in here see what you guys are saying me s is in a flag i think"

"17565810","17569870"," trade i don't know i think that what you need to do in ford is take a look back at"
"17569870","17575130"," their prior errs and i i kind of remember that they always trade up an er then they dump real"
"17575130","17580130"," quick then they come back again like they shake people out then all of a sudden they blast again"
"17582710","17595350"," blue horseshoe says p-ton is going to the moon it's possible the one thing about p-ton is yeah"
"17595350","17599770"," it was a company that probably a good company i think it has more to do with uh just profit"
"17599770","17607070"," just pure profit taken don't think it has anything to do with bad david's asking about uh more risk"
"17607070","17619180"," than reward yeah no i'm not anti anti i would"
"17619180","17623340"," just sell calls on i would just sell calls on you don't have to really sell puts you sell some"

"17637500","17641820"," profit taken this doesn't look like hey this is a bad company or anything i just sell some calls"
"17641820","17647440"," above uh wherever this where this trend line is this selling down trend line is sell something"
"17647440","17657320"," above there like you could sell you could sell calls on boot above 124 125 you"
"17657320","17665490"," sell sell the 125 calls all day long on boot and probably get away with it have some spy puts"

"17742750","17754800"," still like that trade i like the me trade i like anything that's like sold off nicely"

"17769340","17777200"," a mix of big tech it'll be a mix of big tech and some growth companies that are actually producing"
"17777200","17786560"," a product i even like peton i can't say that i don't like peton but i don't like peton's price"
"17786560","17791320"," i think that peton price should we talked about this last week right i think the peton price is"
"17791320","17799240"," closer to uh 10 bucks maybe 15 on a good er but i don't believe that it's a i don't"
"17799240","17809860"," think peton's a 26 dollar or a 30 dollar stock in in any way shape or form i"
"17809860","17816080"," know that stocks split i get all that uh but do i think like do but do i think that"
"17816080","17824760"," snap is worth more than peton i do i think snap is worth more than peton i think snap's potential"
"17825640","17840840"," is stronger than a peton at"
"17840840","17852640"," least in the eyes of an everyday buyer right it's funny"
"17852640","17859920"," how stock price matters even if they have a split right stock price does matter in the eyes of a"
"17859920","17865200"," you know retail buyer or the general consensus viewpoints even though it doesn't really reflect the"
"17865200","17874760"," truth nkla still has calls coming in on a nickele 218 11 c 15 thousand dollars i have some opposing"
"17874760","17883160"," put flow on netflix we had uh no even at that yep opposing put flow in netflix netflix kind of"
"17883160","17891400"," all over the place i want to take a look at netflix by the way see why that is so"
"17891400","17896680"," in netflix right here right it just kind of bottomed out saw some calls coming into netflix"
"17896680","17906640"," originally at 151 this afternoon february 18th 570 c and then i just uh puts come in february"
"17906640","17915940"," 4th 490 p at 356 thousand dollars dangerous trade we can look and see if there's real support here"
"17915940","17929690"," on netflix real quick double "
"17929690","17955030","-sided trade and it doesn't look like it's a it's a straddle or any kind of a complex trade the"
"17955030","17962370"," high on netflix was 700 they had that nice pump rip when they announced the higher price for"
"17962370","17969610"," netflix that was unexpected right you've got people that want the price of netflix lower of course"
"17969610","17978530"," they announced we're going to raise prices and you had a short squeeze down around 500 dollars this"
"17978530","17988390"," was a localized bottom back in august of 2021 yeah i can"
"17988390","17993370"," see why people like netflix here i know people have been talking about netflix recently i'm meant"
"17993370","17999750"," to look it up and i have haven't had the chance you know if you look back you know netflix"
"17999750","18008810"," is a great chart because oftentimes when a stock wants to trade higher in a new channel a new"
"18008810","18017910"," horizontal channel they'll be uh move up above the channel so it moved up let's say from between"
"18017910","18025950"," 479 and 566 moved up to 700 dollars and then you'll often see a capitulation a quick capitulation"
"18025950","18035310"," move down so maybe you'll see like a moment where netflix sells down to let's say 450 and then it"
"18035310","18043310"," swings higher back into that 800 700 swings higher to like let's call it like 645 to 750"
"18043310","18050390"," so it makes this quick capitulation move down then actually swings up and stays in that new higher"
"18050390","18055510"," trading channel if you look at a lot of big tech over a period of time like let's say five"
"18055510","18061850"," 10 years you'll see how these moves work and you'll see that they have the rise to test out new"
"18061850","18070290"," a new channel above they come back down trade below their last channel briefly and then they come"
"18070290","18078060"," back up and trade in that new higher channel i'm not sure why that is at my my assumption from"
"18078060","18083920"," that is that it has more to do with how banks trade stocks that they like and it's a repetitive"
"18083920","18091460"," system that they use consistently on tickers they want to move to the next level i'm assuming that"
"18091460","18097460"," it's at some point it's a computer program but you can you can consistently see this in a lot of"
"18097460","18106900"," growth stocks maybe we see a little bit of selling down like 460 maybe 445 brief moments then we"
"18106900","18111300"," make a move higher and we trade in this new higher trading zone they like netflix over the long"
"18111300","18127350"," term i'll look"

"18158010","18169940"," about netflix but the option premiums i agree with that yeah"
"18169940","18176500"," that was that was my one point why i like your put strategy rather than call strategy winky was"
"18176500","18181280"," because of the expansion if they pull some shit like home depot and they just keep opening stores"
"18182160","18190820"," that's stock i'll just keep blasting off pays dividends as well"

"18227600","18232440"," companies can still drop wages if inflation comes down they can claim that they can drop wages but"
"18232440","18238420"," you'll see like landlords won't drop rents car dealers are scummy they'll keep prices of cars up as"
"18238420","18243880"," long as they possibly can they might never come down again so i think some of this inflation is"
"18243880","18255720"," here to stay you had we had a wage sagflation for past 20 years i want to say so"
"18255720","18263420"," you could see some brutality for another 20 years right we had wages rise up so you might not see"
"18263420","18273300"," another wage increase for another 10 20 years let's even get a better look at at the spy here real"
"18273300","18282140"," quick as that bd bbd loads up still more sellers than buyers you've got some some some call buyers"

"18298960","18307750"," 458 61 a little bit bush spies a little bit bush"
"18307750","18319010"," remember that we still have runway to think about yeah i like jones xlp"

"18347190","18358110"," xlp and xlu if the market declines there was a flee to xlp and xlu in september into december so"
"18358110","18363630"," the price of xlp and xlu went up but if the market sheds some weight you'll just come right back"
"18363630","18368730"," down to where you started in september so i guess the place to hide but it's not a place you"
"18368730","18373350"," used to be able to like buy xlu and we'd go it'd go up while the market went down there"
"18373350","18378670"," are a lot of these uh vol traders that are saying that that's inaccurate and you can't hide in"

"18565680","18573860"," a week if you build up a database of one hundred to three hundred stocks you will definitely get"
"18573860","18579220"," alerts once a week and then you can check then you do your due diligence and say what what is"
"18579220","18585240"," the news that's coming out on this ticker right now why is it dropping is it market conditions is"
"18585240","18590640"," it some bad ER statements why am i buying it here at this price if you always have a steady"

"18629320","18635900"," a prime example if i have three hundred stocks right and i think i'm like i think that sq can"
"18635900","18643600"," survive or i think sq will come into a merger i think that someone will buy sq or the sq"
"18643600","18653540"," can survive and so i put some ridiculous buy zones like eighty nine dollars on sq that sounds"
"18653540","18661200"," crazy i'm setting alert for that i'm setting another alert right hundred and seven dollars or so i"
"18661200","18665560"," set another alert right around there and you just see where it's at see where we are in the market"
"18665560","18671360"," see what the market conditions are and maybe sq doesn't come down to seventy bucks or eighty bucks"
"18671360","18677760"," ninety bucks and i miss it say i miss sq i still have another three hundred stocks that will come"
"18677760","18683440"," down to those low levels that i can then accumulate and take long and i feel confident in what i'm"
"18683440","18688540"," owning i don't feel bad if the stock moves down because i'm comfortable with owning it at that"
"18688540","18698480"," price i see the value at that price in that ticker so i don't like to chase stocks"
"18698480","18703960"," i've got i've got a standing order on sq right on hood i want to own hood at like 12"

"18711000","18716020"," when it gets into that buy zone again i'm going to check to see if the buyers are there or"
"18716020","18721380"," if they have gotten lower i think let's say it it pings at 1360 i'm going to then open up"
"18721380","18727040"," book map and say all right it's in my buy zone or the buyers there now if the buyers move"
"18727040","18734040"," down to ten bucks i'll wait to buy until there's a reaction and that's how you buy falling knives"
"18734040","18742820"," and you try them out try them out with alerts okay so let's take a look at the spy here"
"18742820","18751220"," none of this is bullish right you guys i'll know that we clear on we're not bullish right now in"

"18761130","18772420"," 453 it was 453 13 but because of time i'm probably looking at 452 98 somewhere down"
"18772420","18780040"," here and let's see if we're going to be attracted to lower right now we're going to check and see"
"18780040","18786760"," if we're attracted to lower and you can see this just began right the way guys to see this out"
"18786760","18795720"," here see how buyers are now stepping into 450.23 sometimes these buyers will move higher here but"
"18795720","18801580"," like before we talk about this right if you see we're seeing that the disappearing up here right"
"18801580","18809100"," this means the sellers are stepping in here uh that that uh wall of sellers has come down we can"
"18809100","18813980"," see that the buyers are here this doesn't always happen but you know there's a fair chance compiled"
"18813980","18818600"," with everything else you have out there that it'll be attracted to this number of 450 down below"
"18818600","18828540"," i'm watching a cascade effect of spy puts right now uh january 21 450 p for"

"18940250","18949650"," quantitative uh data it has to be hidden in a trade so it'll be split up against uh a bit"
"18949650","18956310"," against different um like the trade may be broken up between chicago and new york uh it also has to"
"18956310","18963530"," have uh at the at the ask or above it has to be unusual uh usually it's a signature trade"
"18963530","18968730"," there's a signature that different banks use when they buy these trades and then also it'll match"
"18968730","18979220"," up with uh equity blocks dark blue blocks sweeps um splits and i've got"

"18992100","18997760"," for it to make it on this list sometimes you'll see that on mistrades you'll see a stock ripping"
"18997760","19004320"," and uh my program won't follow it because it's looking for specific signatures uh specific specific"
"19004320","19013670"," uh quant triggers for it to come out quant doesn't mean anything all it means is that uh you're"
"19013670","19018910"," adding it's it's just not broad data it has other flags that it has the tag or hit or whatever"

"19041890","19048610"," fat stack of peton puts coming in this is probably one of the larger trades that seem come in peton"
"19048610","19057430"," 128 24 p uh for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars that's significant for peton most of the peton"
"19057430","19074930"," trades were uh like fifty thousand dollars that kind of stuff so"
"19074930","19079070"," yeah i've got a list of how it actually exactly tracks all these all this flow that comes through"
"19079630","19089090"," uh but it has hit certain metrics usually it matches up to dark pool flow as well i've got some"
"19089090","19094450"," alpha flow too so i'll get i'll get some alpha i'll release you get some sign up on your own"

"19145480","19158370"," 21 for fifties are only ninety-one cents min"
"19158370","19169590"," some spy puts at this point it's a pretty big play right there uh that's"
"19169590","19174530"," yeah a million dollar trade for is it we're basically a zero day right so one date trade for a"
"19174530","19188060"," million dollars on spy puts down to 450 that's a significant trade on the spy they"
"19188060","19197820"," took the four fifty sixes but so you got uh more spy puts coming in right now january"
"19197820","19207460"," 21 450 p forty seven thousand dollars we get those last spy puts january 21"

"19216770","19226610"," well that not involved creating some gamma due to daylor and going"
"19226610","19235010"," neutral you know it's which weird i i did spend some time with i'll try to direct you guys"
"19235010","19244250"," there was a um the guy from spot gamma did an interview a couple days ago i think it was"
"19244250","19247710"," a feed i think he did a video that took like i think it was like an hour long video"
"19249010","19256930"," and it was two or three days before the drop to 450 and his point at that time with the"
"19256930","19261950"," information that he had was that he didn't know that he couldn't he he don't normally doesn't say"
"19261950","19266810"," exactly where we're going like he won't be he won't take a conviction stance on where we're going"
"19266810","19273470"," uh but his point was uh he implied earlier that we're going to trade down that we're going to that"
"19273470","19278470"," the call delta is going to be removed from the market if new call delta doesn't come into the"
"19278470","19285610"," market uh that the call wall comes down right then a few days ago we saw uh new puts right"
"19285610","19293010"," at 428 p on spy we saw new iwm puts coming in we didn't see the call flow for the"
"19293010","19301150"," top until today we saw someone microsoft and tesla but it still wasn't that high so you know when"
"19301150","19305650"," you're looking at the call and put walls in the absolute gamma strikes above and below they're"
"19305650","19311490"," moving lower right now and so when you start to see those absolute gamma strikes on the spy get"
"19311490","19320000"," removed and you're going to have a lower ceiling on where the spy is going to go and i think"
"19320000","19325880"," the implication is that you really want to see a lot more call hedging on the high like 480 to"
"19325880","19333680"," replace 500 to replace the delta that's rolling off so if they get start to go neutral into the"
"19333680","19337940"," clothes on tomorrow right and that's how his other point was he doesn't know if they're selling or"
"19337940","19345900"," buying uh the or how the how those calls are being hedged there's also another unknown which is do"
"19345900","19352940"," these long term in the money call holders convert their calls into shares there's someone that's"
"19352940","19357600"," been long for this long and why are they still long these calls was another question there's a"
"19357600","19364400"," bunch of different variables in this equation uh for these in the money call holders deep in the"
"19364400","19369800"," money call holders i should say question is are they going to hold through uh are they going to"
"19369800","19374440"," hold through a pull a rug out from that stuff right so let's say they convert to shares and then"
"19374440","19378560"," they immediately sell pull that pull that money out of the market you've got a double combination"
"19378560","19385100"," of no more cover no more uh no more hedging right the hedging comes out of the market and you've"
"19385100","19392520"," got the equity being pulled out of the market like we had double volatility wammy into friday now"
"19392520","19397020"," in that video they couldn't they didn't know about of course they couldn't know that we had deeper"
"19397020","19403840"," hedging put hedging on them on the market take place a couple days ago and even at that time with"
"19403840","19411740"," the information that they had they said we don't see uh spy trading down below 460 but we didn't"
"19411740","19417320"," have the hedge wall roll in either the moment that hedge that put hedge wall rolled in you saw us"
"19417320","19423220"," trade down to 450 and so if you see that cascade of puts coming in from now into tomorrow and"
"19423220","19429500"," not a cascade of calls coming in you'll see that same effect and that's where you get the the 440"
"19429500","19434260"," and you start looking at the advances, the declineers in the market you start to add all this stuff"
"19434260","19439240"," up and you have to take a position of risk uh and that's when i hear about that vanna trade"
"19439240","19445400"," that they're talking about an SG right now i'm wary of that vanna trade unless we're at a certain"
"19445400","19455330"," price point probably 440 right now for where we are in my view for me only i think we can"
"19455330","19463550"," easily trade down to 440 between now and Tuesday i think we can unless unless there's some"
"19463550","19470670"," information that we don't have at any time that can change you know don't ever try to hold me to"
"19470670","19475450"," something where you know some new information comes into the market but for what we have for"
"19475450","19482750"," information right now uh my stance is that we trade down to it was 450 my stance switched to 450"
"19482750","19489890"," the other day and today my stance is at 440 by monday or Tuesday easy on the table a table"
"19489890","19498830"," is set for it uh we're looking at today's trading right this today's trading look like uh two or"
"19498830","19504030"," three tap recovery bounce heading into next week i don't see that in today's trading had we traded"
"19504030","19512650"," up and got rejected at uh four four what let me look at this again had we traded up and"
"19512650","19521590"," with conviction traded to 460 maybe maybe rip through it bounced below and uh retested 450 possibly"
"19521590","19530270"," we could trade up to 470 480 but this trade this day today does not look like a recovery day"
"19530270","19538870"," to me or like a turn day to me we have now apple puts coming in"
"19538870","19548710"," january 21 175 p for half million dollars spy puts coming in january 21"

"19575870","19582150"," the one that's going to probably fall the most is iwm i have a price target of 196 i think"
"19582150","19586530"," we see that as of right now for all the information that we have available iwm just had more puts"
"19586530","19596960"," come in january 21 204 p 200 thousand dollars one day puts uh my"
"19596960","19606950"," puts are printing right now if you're wondering not a ton 20 percent 25 percent i think they're up"
"19606950","19616680"," at this point if you're just joining us recently uh"
"19616680","19621860"," stick around because over time all these conversations will start to add up i know some of you"
"19621860","19627500"," haven't been here for a long time uh we layer these conversations over the course of days and weeks"
"19627500","19633560"," and we get a viewpoint on the market that starts to add up to where we are today so if"
"19633560","19636920"," you're hearing me talking about something and you're and you don't know exactly why we're talking"
"19636920","19641660"," about the con context of where we're talking it has more to do with something we've been discussing"
"19641660","19647600"," over the course of the past uh few weeks months this conversation has actually been taking place"
"19647600","19657430"," since september as when it began we have one buyer stepping in on the spy january 21 455 c for"
"19657430","19664090"," ninety three thousand dollars impressive uh someone else i think wink here someone was saying he"
"19664090","19669130"," was looking for a bounce at four fifty three or four fifty four something like that i'm looking for"
"19669130","19675650"," more of a bounce down at four fifty three four fifty two ninety three currently hopefully you can"
"19675650","19681090"," get a ripper in the clothes that would wreck some of the puts that are out there but if we"
"19681090","19686990"," don't we could sell off into the clothes as well i do see volatility tomorrow i would expect that"
"19686990","19696190"," people will bring up this uh called out to rolling off i think this is more of the inverse two"
"19696190","19705390"," of an opex i think we can look towards previous opex's and expect us to trade higher on the 21st"
"19705390","19713390"," i think if you look back in most of 2021 most 2020 we're we're normally having call delta roll off"
"19713390","19720470"," excuse me uh we're normally having put delta roll off uh during those months not call delta we have"
"19720470","19729350"," put delta typically rolling off on these opex's and this month we have call delta rolling off it's"
"19729350","19735860"," a little bit different a little bit more inverse than it was in the past so i want to see"
"19735860","19745780"," uh my my my stance is bearish still stance is bearish it's weird i don't know if we"
"19745780","19753660"," see 440 on friday they might like they might we were joto and i were talking earlier sometimes you"
"19753660","19760400"," know you you should trade down to 440 on friday but they wait for those puts to expire and then"
"19760400","19764580"," the following monday or wednesday they'll actually trade down to 440 they won't have to print the"
"19764580","19778400"," 440 anymore they don't nobody gets paid and then we move up from there so raymos"
"19778400","19787210"," are you a real person raymos proctor if you are a bull right you still want to see you either"
"19787210","19795210"," going to if you're a bull you're either getting a v-shape recovery we didn't get that today so if"
"19795210","19801730"," you're not getting a v-shape recovery your second choice as a bull is that you get a retest once"
