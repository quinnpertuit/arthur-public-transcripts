"676040","680120"," Is we're just coming off of this hourly bullishness."
"680680","686960"," I always like to buy these hourly triggers when velocity is pretty bearish. "
"687800","690340"," Like where I'm drawing down here in the bottom right hand side."
"690540","696120"," I love to like see like velocity negative 25 negative 50."

"806070","806350"," They're like. "
"808350","811650"," You know, 430 is not not worth it."
"811890","813530"," We would rather go down to 360."
"814390","816310"," There's more money there in 360. "
"817150","818710"," Trying to cope with trades for that."
"819270","820090"," Same as before."
"820310","824490"," I told you guys this last week are nonstop on this for a month. "
"824970","825550"," Maybe longer."
"826590","830850"," And that's where you just get yourself a ratio spread a put back spread."
"830850","831610"," They're so easy. "
"834290","836510"," This is all about debt ceiling too."
"836670","840310"," If we go down major on debt ceiling, you're going to print like a printer."
"840890","844530"," If we resolve the debt ceiling and slam up 50 or 100 points. "
"845370","847750"," You're going to come out on top and make money or be flat."
"848130","849230"," What you're not going to do."
"850650","851650"," Is get torched. "
"852790","854210"," Close your fin to it accounts."
"854990","856630"," And say I'll come back next month."
"858970","861410"," We've talked about that stuff at nauseam at this point. "
"861850","864770"," There's no reason for you out there not to have."
"866190","867410"," Or taking a consent."
"867630","869890"," You know, we can sit and pontificate all day long about. "
"870770","871590"," I don't know."
"871590","873590"," So I see like I read."
"873790","877030"," So I was reading the mainstream news stories over the weekend. "
"877230","878650"," I try to read like believe it or not."
"878810","883570"," I try to read CNN because whether you like CNN or not."
"883650","884070"," I don't care. "
"884570","887230"," I care what they're feeding Main Street, USA."
"888090","889910"," And they're telling Main Street, USA."
"891750","893110"," If debt ceiling resolves. "
"895350","896770"," The stock market won't crash."
"898190","900370"," They're not telling people out there."
"901050","905590"," Hey, your 401ks are fucked if the debt ceiling is solved. "
"906710","912770"," I'm going to assume that they have some intelligent people out there that are like."
"913630","914910"," That are on these news."
"915730","918310"," Like on the New York Times and Poe Washington Post. "
"918570","919590"," I don't care if it's Fox News."
"919870","920470"," I don't care what you watch."
"921010","922630"," But they're not telling people out there. "
"923390","925810"," Regardless, the stock market's going to crash."
"926910","927970"," They're just not doing it."
"929950","932650"," So just on that, just basing it upon that. "
"934130","939490"," If there's a debt ceiling resolution, I am going to expect the market to go up."
"939710","940970"," Even if it's only an initial reaction."
"943090","944550"," Like you go up, you go up on that. "
"945050","946690"," On the debt ceiling being solved."
"947250","949370"," The stock market because what they're telling people is."
"949910","953050"," Stock market will crash if we don't get a resolution. "
"953390","954750"," If we do get a resolution, your."
"955070","956810"," Your 401ks are safe."
"957950","962730"," Can we get the squeeze higher on that news and then roll over?"
"962870","963130"," Sure. "
"964230","972530"," But I would expect the initial reaction off a resolution to be higher, even if we get a roll over."
"973530","975430"," Yeah, you go higher, you get the roll over."
"975730","978910"," Main street Bob doesn't know any better. "
"979850","983230"," You know, you go up three or fifty points or a hundred points and then they roll it over."
"984250","986210"," And their 401ks look the same."
"987650","990250"," You're going to appease the market. "
"990610","992710"," The collapsed bears at the same time."
"992850","997550"," If we roll over and burn off two or three hundred points still on May for June or something like"
"997550","997770"," that."
"1000210","1004310"," But they're not saying that I want you to know that they're telling me like Main Street Bob. "
"1005270","1008710"," That they're getting a market crash regardless because if you talk to a collapsed bear, it's like."
"1009610","1011770"," If it resolves, it's it's collapsed."
"1012490","1014150"," If it doesn't resolve, it's collapsed. "
"1014810","1016490"," If it's kicked the can down the road, it's collapsed."
"1016950","1021550"," It's a collapse collapse collapse collapse collapse collapse and just nonstop."
"1026280","1028940"," Just just straight up nonstop never ending. "
"1030520","1033220"," So if there isn't a resolution."
"1035500","1037480"," Can we can we have a market collapse?"
"1037920","1037960"," Sure."
"1039460","1041119"," But we're not collapsing the market. "
"1042540","1044180"," Until the last minute either."
"1044180","1046339"," They're they're not going to like just crash market."
"1047200","1048440"," Just for the hell of it. "
"1049020","1050720"," Yeah, we're just going to crash stock market."
"1051100","1052140"," Pre-crash it."
"1053240","1054580"," That kind of stuff. "
"1055240","1056040"," That doesn't happen."
"1056140","1056920"," If you're trying to."
"1059600","1062040"," If you're trying to get not to get caught in that. "

"1071820","1076120"," You're you should already know at that point how to hedge your own your own money."
"1077500","1083600"," We should have no problems hedging that that or you exit the stock market until this major crisis"
"1083600","1084320"," is averted."
"1087930","1089910"," You know, they present themselves. "
"1090170","1092190"," You ever notice that how they present themselves."
"1093510","1095190"," Every month right every three months."
"1095290","1100210"," There's a major crisis where everything is going to go to hell and hand basket. "
"1102070","1108930"," Can can we sure do we we do every you know every one three years we have some major market"
"1108930","1109190"," calamity."

"1122450","1124810"," In October December, you can just step aside. "
"1125630","1126770"," For the next couple weeks."
"1126890","1128890"," You don't even have to get involved here a trader."
"1129030","1130930"," You can just wait until this resolves itself. "
"1131710","1134430"," You don't have to have a position up or a position down you might be."
"1134770","1136350"," I can't figure out put back spreads."
"1136390","1137690"," You just step aside man. "

"1465560","1472700"," From historically you guys know that if you guys know that if the debt ceiling is not resolved"
"1472700","1473080"," right."
"1473800","1477900"," They fire every single mark my words."
"1478400","1485000"," Or historically at least every single politician that was a little elected representative that had"
"1485000","1486000"," to take do with that. "
"1487120","1489660"," Historically at least they all are removed from office."
"1490520","1493000"," The actual voters don't forget that."
"1493460","1495780"," There's a there's a weirdness to this. "
"1496300","1501380"," You can kind of tell people who have money and people who don't have money."
"1502020","1506540"," People with money care greatly about this being resolved."
"1506540","1509480"," Whether they're Republican or Democrat doesn't matter. "
"1509660","1511700"," Oftentimes it's just a matter of money."
"1512480","1514500"," Well, this is a shitty thing to say."
"1515300","1518780"," But now trading back to 420. "
"1519480","1520740"," Congratulations bulls."
"1521720","1522660"," Whoo hoo."
"1523200","1525440"," I'm trading 420 20 right now. "
"1526220","1528500"," 420 C is going burr."
"1533470","1534580"," Oh boy."
"1539340","1541520"," You know if you have money right. "
"1541980","1546000"," It's a fascinating phenomenon that takes place that this to Nick's point."
"1547940","1552440"," So historically when this take let's let's say we didn't reach an agreement like 2011."
"1552960","1555520"," All those people get removed they clean them all out. "
"1556060","1560020"," It's fascinating too because if you're if you're a major taxpayer."
"1561500","1564900"," If you're if you're making you know six figure right right now in today's day."
"1564900","1566060"," You're making six figures. "
"1566200","1566500"," You got a house."
"1566600","1567000"," You got kids."
"1567080","1568560"," You're wrapped into the system. "
"1569600","1571940"," No matter what your political affiliation is."
"1573420","1577140"," There's there's old saying called taxes dummy or something."
"1577700","1579860"," These people go right into the election booth. "
"1580620","1586220"," And they'll talk to their their husbands their wives their buddies their friends."
"1587540","1589840"," And secretly it's always about money."
"1589840","1594240"," It'd be like you know I'm pro life or I'm pro abortion whatever the fuck it is you are. "
"1594740","1598020"," But then they get in there and all they think about is one thing and that's that's what they're"
"1598020","1598320"," paying."
"1598660","1599940"," Like ultimately the tax taxes."
"1601360","1604380"," And then the value of their homes whether they're right or wrong doesn't matter. "
"1605000","1606440"," But they go in there and they go wam."
"1606980","1607840"," They pull that lever."
"1608660","1613220"," And if you hurt them while you're in office like in a major way. "
"1614240","1616640"," They're going to pull that lever again and get rid of you."
"1617520","1619220"," Historically at least that's been the truth."
"1620420","1623260"," So like if we had the burning tires in New York's situation. "
"1624220","1626860"," We didn't have a deal and you're like yeah I want to do this."
"1627100","1629920"," Yeah rich works torches."
"1631200","1633820"," And then it actually happens and you lose everything. "
"1635640","1640480"," For whatever reason you go back to the pool and you're like you know what I'm getting rid of that"
"1640480","1640800"," guy."
"1641320","1643140"," He didn't tell me I was going to get hurt."
"1646620","1648460"," He told me I wouldn't get hurt. "
"1648680","1650820"," He told me we needed this to come down that to come down."
"1651060","1654720"," He told me the pores were fucked and not me but I didn't realize I was part of the pores."
"1666670","1667710"," Damn 420 31. "
"1670150","1674610"," Squeezing higher on hopes that the debt ceiling will be solved."
"1677510","1679690"," Looks like rear view mirror right now."
"1679870","1682070"," It's probably just a squeeze for better liquidity short. "
"1682710","1684770"," The market I guess if you're looking at it that way."
"1687950","1699790"," Let's look"
"1699790","1700310"," up higher."
"1702370","1703950"," There's that 440 up there. "
"1705930","1707930"," There's that 425 up there."
"1710190","1712170"," Look at me I'm sitting up here."
"1714150","1715570"," Top of the world again. "
"1733180","1735600"," Spoons trading for 2039 on the open."
"1738640","1743900"," So from a CNN reporter on Twitter the White House officials and House Speaker McCarthy staff are"

"1928930","1930150"," I think it's going to pop or flop."
"1930810","1932170"," Let's take a look at it right now."
"1932550","1935370"," Take a look. "
"1936610","1937290"," NVDA."
"1938190","1938870"," N."
"1943510","1944190"," Vaidia."
"1956220","1959800"," Currently on nvidia. "
"1961520","1963840"," It's trading below its hourly trigger this morning."
"1964980","1969960"," So its hourly trigger is at 3 10 97."
"1970300","1977340"," I have a price target down below for NVDA of 286 52. "
"1978560","1981160"," Hourly velocity is turned slightly negative."
"1981720","1984200"," It's at a top on its daily velocity."
"1985100","1987040"," I don't actually know that we get that low. "
"1987560","1990400"," I do a price check on it at 290 flats."
"1993280","1996460"," 290 price target down below 290 on NVDA."
"2010480","2011360"," Where are we at?"
"2011640","2012780"," Right there. "
"2022420","2028660"," Good morning out there."
"2028720","2028960"," Good morning."
"2029020","2029260"," Matthew. "
"2029440","2029700"," How are you?"
"2044620","2045280"," Tesla."
"2047260","2056909"," The thing about Tesla is I showed you guys Q1 on Tesla."
"2058889","2060969"," That wasn't you and I buying it. "
"2062409","2067480"," Look at Tesla real quick."
"2068900","2072080"," There's the largest inflows in a Tesla in."
"2076139","2077820"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"2080960","2082380"," This is Tesla right here."
"2085500","2088600"," Q1 had the largest inflows in Tesla that I have."
"2088760","2090120"," People are like yesterday. "
"2090400","2091159"," It's like liquidity."
"2091580","2092440"," Liquidity means everything."
"2092699","2095199"," And I'm like, and then I remember I got yelled at a few weeks ago. "
"2095199","2098160"," People were like, there's no liquidity in this market."
"2099740","2101180"," I was like, yes, there is."
"2103160","2104860"," They've been buying it since Q1. "
"2105260","2108240"," Specifically, the Tesla is the .2 Tesla here."
"2110220","2116160"," Tesla coming up to its weekly at 185 61."
"2117540","2121320"," I want you to know to expect sellers to come in here. "
"2122780","2123340"," Okay."
"2125520","2128500"," Your job is not on Tesla."
"2128820","2131840"," Your job is to is to get in there, right?"
"2132100","2132360"," Trade it. "
"2132840","2133820"," Take your money and run."
"2134640","2137640"," Let the auto bots do the rest for you here."
"2139160","2141480"," And then you pick it back up again above. "
"2141840","2142400"," Does that make sense?"
"2143020","2146240"," So can Tesla break squeeze higher here?"
"2146520","2146740"," Absolutely."
"2147420","2150100"," But this is a place where sellers will come in."
"2150100","2152780"," I assure you of that, sellers will come in here. "
"2154660","2162840"," But you are to take profit here and allow Tesla to consolidate and show you the way higher."
"2163080","2168520"," What you don't want to do is, as we trade up here, get sold down to the depths of hell"
"2168520","2174520"," down here and have a bunch of consolidation down here between 176 and 186."
"2175020","2175400"," That makes sense. "
"2175560","2176440"," You don't get trapped in here."
"2176800","2178880"," You always want to take profit at each level."
"2178880","2180160"," I tell this to bears, right?"
"2180320","2182020"," When I talk to a bear, what do I say to say to a bear?"
"2182460","2188180"," Stop calling fucking crashes and take it every, each level down for each level up. "
"2188420","2192600"," And this is the same thing that I say to bulls."
"2193400","2195500"," So here's a prime example right here, right?"
"2195740","2198420"," Squeeze above the weekly, rolls over."
"2199800","2202680"," Daily comes up to give you some help to go to the upside. "
"2203780","2205420"," One more squeeze higher up here, right?"
"2205420","2207140"," So just right here."
"2207500","2208720"," Look at that, baby."
"2209360","2211080"," Ooh, ooh, doggy. "
"2211780","2214400"," Next layer above is 218, right?"
"2215580","2218240"," And you see this daily trigger right here?"
"2218800","2220460"," You want that help to get up there."
"2221200","2224420"," You want help to go higher, right?"
"2224720","2225920"," This one right here is the hourly."
"2227500","2230820"," So you've got the hourly coming to help up out here. "
"2231300","2233960"," You've got the daily coming to help out here."
"2233960","2240180"," You want price above the weekly to give that monster ramp that you're expecting."
"2241520","2244900"," The other thing here is keep your eyes focused down here, right?"
"2245080","2248000"," We had max bearishness on the daily for Tesla. "
"2249260","2258040"," We're running a little hot right now in the hourly, but this right here, this is the catalyst that"
"2258040","2263460"," you're looking for, for major moves to the upside."
"2264360","2267500"," So each layer, right?"
"2267700","2268420"," Take the money and run."
"2268900","2269900"," Take the money and run. "
"2270740","2271860"," Jump back in."
"2272160","2273600"," Take the money and run, right?"
"2274120","2274720"," Bur in here."
"2275620","2276760"," Bur in here. "
"2281540","2284600"," And then ultimately we got that 300 we've been talking about, right?"
"2285560","2288400"," How about that 300 way up there?"
"2290560","2291960"," Way up there."
"2295120","2298380"," This one right here, this is where the major sellers have been."
"2300960","2305840"," All along, since we hit at 100, this is where the real sellers are up here. "
"2306120","2313480"," We got to overrun these real sellers and get above that monthly and start seeking out 300."
"2315040","2316420"," Good job, Tesla gang."
"2318460","2322280"," I'm going to exit Nvidia and jump on Tesla now. "
"2323460","2324980"," I'm going to rotate, baby."
"2333950","2337570"," I know Tesla bulls out there are like, give me some of that."
"2337790","2339450"," Give me some of that AI money, please. "
"2350250","2359110"," Had a meeting on Saturday for the stock picking show."
"2360430","2364230"," It was very fruitful."
"2372050","2376750"," That should be coming to you on June 18th. "
"2378090","2382430"," I believe it's every Sunday at 11 ish in the morning on Sundays."
"2383530","2389870"," It'll be moved here and there or you may get different hosts, but we've a dedicated host for that"
"2389870","2390250"," show."
"2391490","2396210"," We're going to track a portfolio of long and short duration. "
"2396550","2401550"," It'll be short a short duration portfolio that are catalyst driven."
"2402430","2411530"," Like, hey, we're going to do a trade for, I don't know, an ER report or an anticipated event"
"2411530","2418690"," or debt ceiling trade, whatever it is expressed through a stock."
"2418690","2422970"," And then we're going to do long duration picks. "
"2423770","2427850"," These are at every, at this level here, stops below here."
"2428570","2434630"," We'll run through them for six months, a year, year and a half running portfolio."
"2435990","2439450"," We're going to keep track of those portfolios every year. "
"2440610","2441810"," There's a bunch of cool stuff here."
"2441950","2444650"," You're going to get alerts at some point."
"2445310","2450590"," This will be a free video every weekend. "
"2451930","2456370"," And then once the website is up and running, you'll be able to track all of this stuff over the"
"2456370","2464530"," course of a year and compare it to other people out there that are pushing stocks on the internet"
"2464530","2465090"," or whatever."
"2466650","2470110"," Stock picks and see how we perform versus them."
"2477140","2478340"," So, I look forward to that. "
"2478460","2480460"," That's actually making me very excited."
"2483960","2487300"," It's up to someone we want to grow into for some time now."
"2507970","2510510"," It's been five minutes time now at the top of the hour. "
"2510770","2516070"," Would you see the Eurozone consumer confidence flash forecast is minus 16 spot eight on the prior"
"2516070","2521390"," minus 17 spot five with a range of minus 16 to minus 18 spot five expected."
"2544820","2551500"," Yeah, the live stream is kind of like Sparta and what like I think ultimately what we want is like"
"2551500","2554220"," you get the Sparta during the daytime during live stream, then."
"2554940","2556540"," You're like, Oh, this isn't kind of my speed. "
"2556640","2557940"," I'm like hanging out with cap."

"2794650","2801330"," I did have, you know, I had that, dude, I don't know if this is like karma or something. "
"2802550","2806310"," I had a, I was talking to you guys about some bad experiences with the pets."
"2807170","2809210"," We had a pet that got sick."
"2810090","2810890"," We had a cat. "
"2813090","2820690"," And I was telling my children, I was like, man, I was like, when I was a kid, we seemed"
"2820690","2821930"," to go through a lot of kittens."
"2821930","2823850"," Or not kids, but cats when I was a kid."
"2823870","2825730"," They were all outdoor in indoor cats. "
"2826010","2826850"," Like come and go as they please."
"2827950","2837730"," And they would, they would make it like six to nine years if we were lucky."
"2837850","2841430"," We get run over and stuff. "
"2841590","2845670"," You know, other animals would get at them by signing up to the tick."
"2845990","2855860"," And my parents were kind of anti fully"
"2855860","2856700"," indoor cat."
"2857120","2860600"," We had an indoor cat when I was young and it wasn't happy. "
"2861640","2864060"," Being an indoor cat, you could tell that he suffered."
"2864060","2866380"," Oh, he just wanted to be outside all the time."
"2876440","2878660"," And so, you know, eventually with the cat outside. "
"2879120","2881920"," So this past year our cat, we have our cat this year."
"2882040","2885100"," We're like, this cat's getting a little old to be outside."
"2886180","2889520"," We're trying to keep mine side and he hasn't been successful at it. "
"2889600","2890720"," He's been like an outdoor cat."
"2893040","2896400"," And it's like outdoor indoor comes and goes as he pleases."
"2896740","2901120"," And we haven't been that successful trying to keep him inside. "
"2901960","2905100"," And he got into a fight springtime fight."
"2906080","2908720"," All these new cats in the neighborhood and cats."
"2910260","2911440"," You know how they are in the spring. "
"2911660","2912820"," They're all out there hot and bothered."
"2914360","2917420"," Groups like sex, all kinds of weirdness, right?"
"2918820","2921780"," Springtime for cats is like mating season and."
"2922880","2926020"," The side and who owns what or whatever it is the cats do. "
"2926060","2930800"," So he came home with a cut above his eye."
"2932440","2934380"," So we brought him to the vet."
"2936120","2938620"," And the vet put him on some medication. "
"2940220","2944360"," So that he didn't he wouldn't get a an infection."
"2946640","2950360"," The infection went into his brain."
"2952100","2956610"," And they also found out that he had liver issues there. "
"2957480","2962280"," They think that his liver issues were from his childhood or something or had something that was"
"2962280","2962960"," genetic."
"2964040","2971340"," The medication that he took wound up killing him over this weekend."
"2971340","2972560"," He died over this weekend. "
"2972560","2976540"," And we brought him back to the vet."
"2977480","2984300"," And it cost me $800 to try to save his life."
"2984520","2985280"," He died this weekend. "
"2986800","2988440"," So he had that happen this weekend."
"2989040","2993500"," So I do have something that I have to take care of this morning."
"2994280","2997940"," At some point I have to the live stream will stay up this morning. "
"2997940","3002060"," But I do have to take care of something for this at some point this morning."
"3004040","3005200"," Children are devastated."
"3007100","3007740"," Completely devastated. "
"3008520","3009400"," This cat is like."
"3010800","3013860"," They're even more than the dogs to some extent or not."
"3013980","3015300"," I don't know if it's a different kind of thing. "
"3016100","3018180"," The kids like our cat is like."
"3018720","3020380"," You know cats are assholes."
"3021440","3022760"," But they're your asshole. "
"3024780","3027580"," So like this cat would come to me for specific things."
"3028300","3031260"," He always cuddled and slept with my children."
"3032320","3034620"," And that was his thing, right?"
"3034880","3038400"," He really like he found them to be his protection. "
"3039360","3040500"," Whatever he had in the house."
"3040500","3041860"," And so they loved on this cat."
"3042060","3043940"," We've had him for years now. "
"3046560","3048640"," Yeah, and this is a family pet man."
"3052160","3054740"," We don't treat our pets like their pets."
"3055000","3056000"," They're like members of the family. "
"3056400","3058180"," And so we lost a cat this weekend."
"3059140","3059980"," And it was devastating."
"3062460","3064980"," Kids are like a wreck over this. "
"3066940","3069320"," So we've been dealing with that all weekend as a family."
"3069820","3073840"," Normally we bury our pets in our back 40."
"3074580","3078620"," This time they chose cremation so they can take the cat out of it. "
"3079860","3081380"," They're not into the burials anymore."
"3081720","3088440"," We usually do like a big Scottish burial form with bagpipes and casket and do a ceremony."
"3089500","3090820"," Now they just want a memorial. "
"3091400","3096080"," And we're going to like cast a memorial stone for them in the back 40."
"3096440","3100560"," And then they want to keep kitty with them forever, which I get it."
"3102140","3103080"," So they're devastated. "
"3106820","3110240"," Come back down to check the hourly trigger right now."
"3110340","3113860"," We are checking comments from ECB's Lane and ECB's Villaroy."
"3114200","3118620"," So ECB's chief economist Lane speaks at the Austrian central bank conference in Vienna. "
"3119380","3122760"," While ECB's Villaroy speaks at a conference in Paris."
"3123440","3124340"," Yeah, it sucks man."
"3125000","3126860"," There's some good parts to this. "
"3127220","3131960"," You know, kids part of the reason people who people have domesticated animals for a bunch of"
"3131960","3132780"," different reasons, but."
"3132780","3135860"," It's good for your children to learn about loss too."
"3137140","3137960"," The cost. "
"3139920","3141940"," The care that you have for."
"3142660","3146160"," It's like this whole, it's this whole like paradigm."
"3146460","3147960"," It's like a, maybe it is a paradigm. "
"3148860","3149660"," It's whole thing like."
"3152160","3156620"," Caring about an animal not being mean to animals is part of it."
"3157200","3159580"," And the part of it is the cost to take care of an animal. "
"3160640","3162480"," What you'll expend for an animal."
"3164940","3168200"," How you treat other people as well."
"3168420","3170120"," There's some like relationship to people. "
"3187610","3190870"," It's going to help them to deal with death when I get old and die, right?"
"3191090","3196270"," They at least have some experiences with people that when they lose them when they get older, that"
"3196270","3196770"," kind of stuff."
"3196950","3198330"," So there is some benefit there too."
"3199390","3201730"," In Washington DC. "
"3202650","3205970"," Come back down to test the hourly trigger right now."
"3223870","3227170"," So John Haggerty lost the cat this past week as well."
"3227390","3228650"," Yeah, this was completely unexpected. "
"3229490","3232570"," I got to tell you, man, we do like we thought this was all normal."
"3232570","3233790"," Like everything was fine."
"3234050","3234670"," No big deals. "
"3236850","3240370"," And it was it was like DEF CON four."
"3242950","3247350"," Zero like X like zero anything was wrong."
"3250090","3253230"," And we had no no ideas here that anything was wrong. "
"3260070","3261090"," Yeah, it was tough."
"3261870","3262390"," Absolutely."
"3262970","3265510"," If you guys know about love, like if you have love pets. "
"3267250","3268050"," Like I'll be fine."
"3268490","3278990"," We weren't"
"3278990","3278990"," fine."
"3278990","3283630"," Right now we've also have a bear plane forming rug pull going on right now. "
"3284610","3288270"," Trained down to tag the pre market low."
"3288490","3290650"," This is this yellow line right here is pre market low."
"3291170","3292910"," We also have a pre market low. "
"3293130","3294290"," I'll snap this one for you."
"3294370","3296750"," I forgot to do this one one right there."
"3297550","3302910"," That's the that's the low from I'm just going to show you guys this stuff. "
"3304650","3307770"," That's the low from Friday."
"3307770","3310170"," And then we've got a couple more here for you."
"3310210","3312010"," I'll get rid of this one right there. "

"3324090","3326410"," complex in Washington, D.C. Oh shit. "
"3326570","3328570"," In the dollar emoji S&P."
"3328710","3333010"," Warning warning that there was an explosion at the Pentagon moments ago."
"3334350","3341790"," I'll try to get more news here for you in just a minute. "
"3350420","3351900"," You guys copy all that."
"3352940","3358260"," There was an explosion at the Pentagon complex moments ago."
"3358980","3360500"," Be really careful of this. "
"3361540","3365100"," If these if you get more than one it could be very very."
"3377340","3383060"," Until it is known that there's a that this is over when these things when these events happen."
"3383060","3388100"," If there's still risk of more explosions, the market can really continue to sell off. "
"3389540","3390880"," Hard and heavy."
"3395510","3406420"," Large explosion near the Pentagon complex in Washington, D.C. Breaking"
"3406420","3410440"," market news is claiming it's a very large explosion or a large explosion."
"3410440","3414620"," Now we're expecting comments from ECB's Lane and ECB's. "
"3414640","3416060"," I have a friend at the Pentagon."
"3416360","3417300"," I'll ask right now."

"3445130","3446910"," Huge squeeze right there. "
"3462480","3466500"," So worth noting this event still not reported on the way it made in use."
"3466500","3471460"," Why is there is a one image circulating Twitter to sing from a variety of our Twitter sources that"
"3471460","3472080"," this has happened."
"3472200","3475580"," And again, did you see the markets react to that initially as well. "
"3475920","3480180"," It was still a waiting confirmation whether there has been an explosion near the Pentagon."
"3485510","3486210"," Thanks Adam."
"3486370","3487050"," Second right now. "
"3500060","3501820"," Does anybody have a video of that explosion?"
"3510210","3513670"," The tweet was deleted over something that tweet via DM."
"3532020","3536580"," So we did see some reports from Politico earlier that Biden was going to be meeting with McCarthy"
"3536580","3538380"," at 4 30 PM Eastern time."
"3538640","3542800"," I just think it released from the White House now saying the US President Biden and House Speaker"
"3542800","3546480"," McCarthy to meet at 5 30 PM Eastern time on the debt ceiling. "
"3546860","3548900"," So again, this is coming directly from the White House."
"3548900","3556880"," Look at that range on a Monday."
"3557240","3562900"," Holy shit. "
"3573220","3574460"," That's a big ass explosion."
"3578780","3579420"," Motherfucker."
"3619810","3622490"," So I'll repost this on my Twitter feed here. "
"3623690","3626070"," I want you to hang tight guys."
"3647280","3648540"," We are surely expecting."
"3648820","3649480"," I did just reap. "
"3649720","3654520"," I did just retweet something for you guys on Twitter if you want to take a look at it."
"3661040","3663020"," Looks like the tweet was already deleted."
"3663020","3664740"," Somebody grabbed a screenshot of it. "
"3677760","3682500"," On your hands is chatting with someone who can see smoke from their windows right now."
"3688240","3689780"," I haven't heard back from anyone."
"3690380","3692820"," I'm asking a family member right now too. "
"3704990","3711030"," So it looks like the explosion tweet has been deleted from the original account."
"3717940","3724920"," So originally from OS OS IT posted out the image of the explosion before it needs to pentagon"
"3724920","3729540"," Washington DC now been, which has now been removed."
"3731100","3732040"," Hang tight guys. "
"3796320","3797200"," I'm not going."
"3797460","3798640"," I don't want to make any."
"3808950","3810070"," It could be nothing. "
"3810390","3815090"," You know, if it's nothing, I don't want to fan those flames without any kind of confirmation."
"3816030","3818910"," It could just be a dumpster fire for all we know, right?"
"3819830","3822270"," But until they figure out what it is, I'd be used."
"3822550","3823510"," I'd use caution at least. "
"3823510","3826570"," I was."
"3834920","3836160"," I won't bring that up."

"3871580","3873380"," Hurry up and wait as the term for it."
"3877950","3879570"," There's already some videos coming out. "
"3880910","3883790"," So just giving some commentary as to why they deleted the post."
"3884170","3888150"," So they did just say for the time being they have deleted the post regarding the explosion near the"
"3888150","3891730"," pentagon in Washington DC, even though there are tons of accounts reporting it."
"3891730","3896910"," But there seems to be no evidence of it taking place besides one picture and these quotes on quotes"

"5432720","5437360"," Biden administration opposes the measure to block students debt relief."
"5437600","5439680"," Let me know what you think about the debt relief for students. "
"5440580","5441980"," What are your thoughts on that?"
"5442480","5446740"," I know people with student loans are like I get that I think some of it I think I know"
"5446740","5447040"," but."
"5448640","5450640"," What are your thoughts on student debt relief?"
"5452420","5455180"," Supposedly that removed will be devastating to our economy."
"5455800","5457860"," People have to go back to paying the student loans. "
"5467350","5471930"," What's my prognosis for today and prognosis was to let the market open."
"5472350","5478110"," So when we came into this today at this morning's open I was not keen on taking a position."
"5484470","5488570"," I like the idea like personally I like the idea of. "
"5489750","5490850"," Consolidation into Wednesday."
"5492630","5497590"," And then on Wednesday to get the minutes out and have some sort of a."
"5498350","5501550"," I want to see like the minute say we are probably going to pause this summer."
"5502150","5503570"," Getting a nice reaction to the upside. "
"5504870","5509030"," Taking that trade getting a debt debt ceiling resolution that kind of stuff."
"5509030","5512110"," It just seems like it's a it seems like consolidation."
"5512610","5513570"," Whatever you get a move. "
"5514830","5519670"," One up or down sometimes to the downside you'll get like two three day move."
"5520190","5524370"," Upside you'll get a two or three day move and then you'll have a period of consolidation."
"5524910","5530970"," You never really get like just straight up or straight down that kind of stuff. "
"5531150","5538150"," So my own personal thesis here is oftentimes you'll get like the move right."
"5538150","5539910"," You'll get the move up or down doesn't matter."
"5540690","5543410"," And then you'll get people jump on that move. "
"5544090","5546870"," The fourth and fifth day and they get blood out."
"5548010","5550030"," And now depending on where the move went."
"5551010","5553650"," You're getting two kinds of trader here right. "
"5554530","5558230"," You're getting a bear that wants or you're getting sell side that wants."
"5558870","5560350"," Their original target."
"5560810","5562410"," So let's look at something here. "
"5566730","5567950"," It's a good question by the way."
"5570670","5572610"," Let's get rid of that because the weekend's over."
"5573570","5573710"," So. "
"5583370","5587580"," I will get rid of that too."
"5588020","5588260"," Okay."
"5588560","5589900"," Just get rid of that blue box for me. "
"5590160","5590740"," See this."
"5591400","5591700"," Okay."
"5592140","5592240"," So. "
"5594260","5595360"," Right in here right."
"5597940","5599080"," We got the move higher."
"5599950","5605280"," And if you're able to take that move higher you profit it right. "
"5606580","5611980"," If you didn't get that move higher and let's say you're positioned to the to the downside."
"5614000","5617700"," You're going to spend this whole week here just hoping and praying."
"5619120","5622780"," That it comes down here and in Prince Valhalla for you. "
"5623300","5625120"," And that's the pain trade right."
"5628340","5630720"," And so what you'll do is you're going to sit there."
"5630840","5634360"," And even if we do go there it's going to bleed you out until it gets there. "
"5635200","5635840"," That's the truth."
"5637440","5639260"," Like eight, nine times out of ten."
"5639680","5641640"," Sometimes it comes back but normally it doesn't. "
"5643820","5645520"," So you've got that person out there."
"5647980","5649220"," You next person."
"5652700","5653380"," Wasn't short. "
"5653380","5656260"," But was too scared to go long."
"5657460","5663180"," That person wants the market to continue higher on Friday on Monday."
"5663660","5664940"," They just want it right. "
"5665480","5666300"," They want it on Friday."
"5666560","5667220"," They want it on Monday."
"5667380","5667960"," They want it on Tuesday. "
"5668260","5668800"," They want it on Wednesday."
"5670220","5673780"," This doesn't always happen but usually will happen here."
"5675180","5677160"," If we are going to continuation. "
"5678600","5681380"," It's going to take some consolidation to get to the upside."
"5683960","5685340"," If we do get a roll."
"5686820","5692460"," That can't happen as well but it won't be until all those, all those, all those positions, all that"
"5692460","5693960"," bearish positioning is dead. "
"5695420","5699560"," So my own thesis here is continuation to the upside."
"5700580","5703420"," You know that I'm like I'm happy with 420 as the top."
"5704100","5705160"," Let's make that statement. "
"5705580","5708960"," Like the original target was let's get 420 and possibly 430."
"5709640","5710140"," We got 420."
"5711300","5712440"," That's all I can ask for. "
"5712440","5713420"," I'm happy with that."
"5713660","5716700"," If we have continuation of 430 or 4300."
"5717200","5721620"," Well I think it's more like 427 somewhere in there. "
"5722320","5723160"," It could be higher."
"5723560","5724780"," The JPM caller is higher."
"5725980","5727220"," They like to overshoot it sometimes. "
"5727880","5729140"," So I can see that trade too."
"5733500","5735800"," But it's normally not just straight up."
"5736140","5738980"," My key pointer is normally not like we're going to 420. "
"5739320","5740480"," We're going to 430 on Monday."
"5742980","5745880"," It's usually, you know, you zig and you zag to get there."
"5747940","5755520"," So my own, my own contention here is that you see into at least one, I'd like to see it"
"5755520","5757600"," at least into Wednesday, which is that trade. "
"5758620","5761840"," For me nothing's changed since I told you guys it's on Friday, right?"
"5762540","5763760"," Some kind of consolidation."
"5767740","5769980"," You can have like a down moment or not moment."
"5770620","5774020"," But some kind of consolidation for a trip higher. "
"5775740","5776700"," That's what I want to see."
"5778980","5780060"," And it's Monday, right?"
"5780240","5782140"," So you just let the market open up and breathe a little bit."
"5782740","5783620"," Find out where we're headed. "
"5784540","5787100"," We had the squeeze up on the open this morning."
"5787560","5789860"," And then we came back down on some fake ass news."
"5790800","5793260"," And we're kind of range bound for today, right?"
"5793820","5796260"," So if you're going to try to buy or sell something. "
"5796840","5800760"," You're buying a dip down at S1 and you're selling a rip above it R1."
"5806470","5809930"," There's also some new targets to the down and upside as well, right?"
"5810430","5814250"," We already cleaned out for 1736."
"5814630","5817790"," So to the downside, I'm going to expect us to tag S1 down here. "
"5819070","5822350"," So next target to the downside is for 1707."
"5823270","5826510"," Target to the upside is this mess that's above."
"5828050","5833510"," All this garbage up in here from Friday for 2089 for 2072. "
"5835050","5836730"," We probably hit R1."
"5837210","5843930"," I've got it at four 2045, but when I made that R1 this morning, I'm probably off by a couple"
"5843930","5844390"," pennies."
"5844810","5847830"," I just throw them up there and we're like, let's go close enough for me. "
"5851630","5855690"," Another posy that you could take here is that we're loaded to the gills of puts again today."
"5857370","5858870"," Just due to that fear."
"5859710","5861370"," People are out there at the buttons. "
"5861610","5864390"," They're just like slam, slam, slam, by puts, by puts, by puts."
"5866690","5871630"," As we get into the end of the day, if they haven't already burned them off, if they leave them"
"5871630","5873730"," on the end of the day, we could make it down to the downside."
"5874930","5878530"," If they haven't burned them off of the sideways move, we will go higher. "
"5881670","5882970"," Bring that over right there."
"5884390","5886110"," They got a torch from first."
"5887390","5889650"," So we've got four 18 P's, right?"
"5889810","5894970"," We have 280,000 for 18 P's. "
"5895830","5898610"," So they either have to go to zero by trading sideways."
"5901350","5903630"," We need more buyers of said puts."
"5913970","5916830"," Or they'll burn them and hit them in the day. "
"5917150","5917910"," One of those two, three."
"5918990","5921270"," I have no, I have no like bias here."
"5922150","5926870"," My thought is that we trade sideways and down until Wednesday and then we get a move. "
"5927190","5928210"," Probably Thursday or Friday."
"5938400","5943140"," It's not intelligent to give 18 year olds on collateralized loans and make a wish close to zero"
"5943140","5946300"," banks alone, 18 year old, anything without people without collateral."
"5946660","5946780"," Yeah. "
"5949080","5950520"," I don't like the."
"5953440","5954180"," There you go."
"5954240","5957080"," You got a nice target down below four one, one, eight, nine. "
"5959660","5961460"," I don't know that I like."
"5964380","5966220"," How much education has changed?"
"5967240","5968900"," I feel like there should always be like a free."
"5969980","5971120"," They're kind of is. "
"5972320","5975700"," If your students is does great in school."
"5977760","5980640"," There is usually kind of an option for your student, right?"
"5980760","5983900"," If a kid worked hard or had help or whatever."
"5984880","5986940"," I still don't like our system particularly. "
"5988180","5989500"," I like the idea of."
"5990740","5992820"," If you can get the grades, you should get a free education."
"5993640","5995880"," There are some ways for students to get that. "
"5998500","6000300"," Still a minefield though, isn't it?"
"6000440","6001700"," It seems like it's still a minefield."
"6001920","6003760"," Most most kids do wind up with that debt."
"6009430","6015530"," Like on the one side, it's like, yeah, if your, if your child wants to go to college, there's ways"
"6015530","6016810"," for them to go to school for free. "
"6017110","6019950"," But then there's a lot of students out there that they're like, I didn't have that."
"6020170","6021510"," I'm a great student and I didn't have that."
"6021970","6022850"," I want to have taken loans. "
"6028330","6031630"," So why are we settling under developed brains of thousands of on a degree?"
"6032530","6032950"," We're not used."
"6033170","6035170"," And there's a whole system built into this too, right?"
"6036050","6037830"," For university systems to make money."
"6038330","6040050"," To settle that debt on students. "
"6045180","6046800"," Yeah, I taught, I paid mine too."
"6047180","6051080"," Some, the military paid for some of mine and then I paid for the rest of mine."
"6051140","6052980"," I had some, I was like a mixed bag. "
"6053140","6056300"," I had some academic scholarships that were actually athletic."
"6058380","6060020"," They ran that scam for me."
"6061140","6063360"," And then I had some GI bill that paid. "
"6065420","6067020"," And then I think I was done."
"6067020","6074880"," I think my loans, when I was done, I was left with like 25,000 and student loans."
"6075060","6080480"," I still have, I think two or $3,000 left of those loans to this day. "
"6089600","6096840"," Yeah, there's a, I know that, or not that I know from what kids say."
"6098280","6099760"," And that's another weird thing."
"6100560","6104580"," So schooling was just getting expensive when I was a kid. "
"6104960","6110300"," It was just turning into becoming very expensive."
"6110760","6113520"," My universities that I attended."
"6115600","6119720"," My, the original university I went to school was 40,000 a year. "
"6121580","6123200"," This was a long time ago."
"6124280","6126440"," As well as Feds Barkin."
"6126740","6131980"," So the discussing technology enabled disruption during a conference on these subjects hosted by the"
"6131980","6132780"," Richmond of Fed. "
"6133200","6135540"," So texting Q&A still to be determined as well."
"6135720","6140840"," We do expect to hear comments from Feds daily who participate in a fireside chat at the National"
"6140840","6143600"," Association for business economics."
"6144300","6148200"," Text not expected as a Q&A with the moderator and audience is. "
"6152260","6158880"," But that, that, you know, it's not, it's a, it's a small like Ivy League school and that education"
"6158880","6161180"," today is not as, it's like double."
"6161540","6164260"," It's about 70 K a year to go to attend that school right now."
"6165320","6170060"," And like your full package is read roughly like 74, 73, 74,000. "
"6170420","6174200"," I also went to the UCLA system for a time out."
"6174420","6177220"," I was in the military side and have to bounce around and keep going to school."
"6178200","6179460"," Now to finish up. "
"6184530","6189490"," And I have children right now that are getting prepared to go to college."
"6190530","6200350"," My oldest is about two years from going to university and it scares us of the cost of it."
"6200890","6205190"," There's no way that they're going to be eligible for tuition. "
"6206210","6210130"," So it's, we're either paying for it out of pocket signing for it."
"6211110","6214270"," Or it's a scholarship of some kind, right?"
"6214410","6217210"," You either do an athletic or academic based on your."
"6218730","6220410"," And even then I think it's a minefield. "
"6221310","6222730"," I saw, I saw a kid."
"6223390","6225630"," He was not like a tick tock or something and."
"6227290","6229110"," He was an outstanding student. "
"6229510","6231270"," He had like, I think he had a."
"6232970","6239210"," Top point, 0 1% of SAT score taker valentictorian at his high school."
"6239570","6241170"," I don't know if there's a man or a woman."
"6241310","6242710"," I don't remember a young guy or young woman. "
"6242990","6244950"," This was recently like last month or something."
"6245350","6247690"," He had like a tick tock video where he applied to a bunch of schools."
"6248910","6252550"," And he didn't get into any of the top schools. "
"6252970","6254770"," They were just like, you know, you're not rich."
"6255210","6256570"," You're not, you're not building us a library."
"6256850","6257330"," So get fucked. "
"6264370","6266770"," Yeah, you got to stay tuition stipend."
"6268730","6270190"," We're wondering we are."
"6271730","6276730"," The stuff that our oldest daughter does, I would expect her to get a free ride. "
"6276870","6278530"," It's probably not going to be."
"6279250","6280650"," At a school of choice."
"6281590","6285930"," My assumption is that she'll go to the University of Michigan. "
"6286210","6287050"," That'd be my assumption."
"6289270","6290290"," Or that'll be like."
"6291310","6294950"," That's a school that'll take her because she's an end state student. "
"6295670","6297930"," She's hit everything every metric to go to that school."
"6298190","6298670"," It's great school."
"6299210","6299730"," It's like top. "
"6299870","6302610"," I think it's 150 in the country or top 100 in the country."
"6302950","6305170"," A lot of engineering engineers go there."
"6314830","6316250"," But it's a minefield. "
"6316790","6318050"," It's a total minefield."
"6318490","6319850"," I'm not looking forward to this."
"6321590","6323070"," That's the thing that I tell my kids. "
"6323210","6324730"," I'm like, you have to be good at something."
"6324910","6325790"," I don't care what you're good at."
"6327590","6332010"," And then that's the other part of it is that my daughter is good. "
"6332010","6332450"," Good examples."
"6332710","6336610"," So my daughter can pretty much be whatever she wants in life."
"6338110","6339590"," She's highly intelligent. "
"6340610","6342230"," She can get any degree that she wants."
"6343070","6347390"," She's her essay or PSATs are outstanding."
"6348370","6353830"," And of course, even I'm telling her, I'm like, yeah, maybe you get that degree that. "
"6355810","6357550"," Guarantees that you make."
"6358550","6360730"," 90 out of college or 80 out of college."
"6361570","6365690"," Without any further education, you could get something, some kind of an actual. "
"6366490","6369450"," Something that pays with the degree like."
"6369910","6371430"," It's hard today to be like."
"6372890","6377970"," You're going to have to settle all of this debt and possibly get a degree that you won't get paid"
"6377970","6378270"," with. "
"6380690","6386770"," Or if you don't do continuing education after that degree, they're kind of left in the lurch."
"6387250","6389730"," I'm like, it's a weird time for kids right now."
"6395680","6397020"," Yeah, it's I agree with that, Evan. "
"6397760","6399100"," It's up to the student to perform."
"6401900","6407380"," Like I was like, she wants to go to graduate school and become a doctor or something."
"6407980","6412460"," And I'm like, like, you know, you could do is, you know, you just get like a four year. "
"6413460","6418820"," Science degree and then become like a respiratory therapist and we're guaranteed to get some money"
"6418820","6419100"," and."
"6420460","6422980"," You know, kind of x-ray tech or something like."
"6423740","6424660"," You're going to make some money. "
"6426620","6429600"," And be able to take care of yourself."
"6429800","6433760"," That's one of the key points there too is like, I'm like, look, I want you to be able to"
"6433760","6436260"," take care of yourself and not have a man take care of you."
"6436600","6440220"," I want you to be I want to be able to take care of yourself. "

"6593900","6596660"," It has to do with, you know, this sucks to say. "
"6598500","6599720"," It's like a backdoor."
"6600500","6600860"," It's gross."
"6601600","6602000"," It's like. "
"6603700","6606580"," It's more about people meeting other people."
"6607740","6608480"," Powerful people."
"6610000","6610960"," It's kind of gross. "
"6619110","6621630"," To be about saying countries like Germany, France, Norway."

"6670350","6671490"," Most don't."
"6672950","6676530"," But if you can get out of college and make 70 to 90 K a year, you can usually move"
"6676530","6677750"," up to about 120, 130."
"6678390","6679130"," That's good money. "
"6679390","6680630"," It's not bad money, but it's good money."
"6682030","6687310"," Talking about what I'm talking about is you getting out of school with a degree that doesn't pay"
"6687310","6689990"," you a job after college, right?"

"6710120","6711440"," We have a lot of medical people."
"6711600","6713300"," And then, of course, the other side of family are all engineers. "
"6713900","6717160"," It's like all engineers and kind of doctors."
"6719640","6722200"," The engineering side of the family are really smart."
"6722520","6723300"," They're like the brains. "
"6732660","6742280"," Yeah, well, there's, there's, there's like a, they don't all work hard to get in."
"6743140","6743940"," I'll say that."
"6744300","6745860"," They don't all work hard to get in those schools. "
"6746800","6747860"," A lot of that is power."
"6748740","6754100"," That's, I mean, there are some, there's like the, there's like the token story of that happening,"
"6754100","6755400"," but that's not what really happens."
"6757400","6761720"," That's a place for like my rich kid to meet your rich kid and continue more power. "
"6763800","6766140"," They use, I think it used to be like that Stacy."
"6766500","6768560"," I think we're, I think we're getting too old."
"6771500","6777680"," I don't think it was always like that Stacy, but I think it is like that today. "
"6778300","6780740"," He saw it in the college scandal right for Stanford."
"6781560","6786560"," It's like just make up a stupid fucking sport that I, I don't actually, I don't actually, I'm not"
"6786560","6789500"," actually playing and I don't."
"6789620","6792460"," You know, it's not like, it's not like millions either. "
"6792640","6795500"," It's like 20 million, 30 million, 50 million."
"6797640","6802380"," US 10 year and 30 year yields extend climate to top the last week's highs."
"6805300","6807600"," So they have chosen destruction of puts. "
"6810760","6817400"," They've chosen destruction, put destruction, no follow through on buying more puts to the downside."
"6821720","6822880"," I don't think you can work hard."
"6823000","6824000"," That's what this guy was saying. "
"6824200","6825620"," That this kid was like, I worked hard."
"6826580","6828220"," This kid was like, I worked hard."
"6828400","6829900"," I have top SATs. "
"6829980","6830320"," I was valedictorian."
"6830320","6833000"," He didn't come from a wealthy family."
"6833560","6838060"," And then he's like, then you find out they allow like one, like a token kid into that, but that's"
"6838060","6838240"," it. "
"6838980","6841200"," It's not based on merit any longer."
"6844480","6850160"," I think it once was, they were sent, what they were talking about to Stacy was the number of kids"
"6850160","6853460"," that want to go to college has, you know, grown exponentially."
"6853980","6854700"," It's just not a seat. "
"6855820","6861940"," So, you know, it's just too many people that want to go to college today."
"6862340","6863940"," So you've got competition."
"6864920","6867700"," You know, it always devolves to the lowest common denominator, right?"
"6867840","6868540"," Who's got more power?"
"6868800","6873220"," Who's got my wife and I have no allegiance to my alma mater?"
"6873580","6877540"," My wife does have allegiance to all matter. "
"6877960","6880020"," And that's important too, right?"
"6880700","6881840"," There's like breed in this."
"6881840","6885100"," I don't know if you like, there's some breed to being alma mater."
"6885240","6890260"," There's breed to have you been donating for two decades to your alma mater. "
"6890500","6897080"," Have you kept in touch with the people that make decisions that your alma mater makes it easier?"
"6905540","6906340"," Yeah, Bebop."
"6906500","6908520"," That was my, that was close to my experience."
"6909380","6910380"," Not my wife's. "
"6910480","6913940"," My wife, my experience was very similar to yours, Bebop."
"6915120","6916600"," My wife, you know what she did?"
"6917060","6922060"," She, she was fully supported to go to college and she parted her way right out of college."
"6925020","6926740"," Still like my wife is very smart. "
"6927760","6932820"," And her dad was like, I'll pay for, her dad, her dad did write what I'm doing with my kids."
"6933700","6939680"," Her dad was like, I will, I will fund your college as long as you don't get kicked out."
"6940320","6944040"," So she didn't get kicked out, but she partied her first semester. "
"6944420","6945460"," She went on to academic probation."
"6946540","6948160"," She partied her second semester."
"6949100","6951880"," And that was it right out the door, expensive university. "
"6953620","6955660"," And she was, this kind of funny story."
"6955920","6958900"," So she was, she joined the army."
"6960220","6962700"," So her first year of university, it was didn't go well. "
"6963020","6964880"," She joined the army, reserves."
"6967700","6970440"," And she found a university that was cheap."
"6971660","6977440"," She went to a, an actual university of, I'm not going to tell you guys where she went to school,"
"6977540","6981500"," but she went to a university of, and a tuition for in state. "
"6982940","6984700"," This is kind of funny to tell you guys."
"6985660","6989120"," So the tuition for in state tuition for this university was dirt cheap."
"6989780","6990800"," It's like a few grandi here. "
"6992120","6996480"," So what she did was, if you're in the military and you pick a duty station."
"6999300","7004300"," That's wherever you pick your duty station, a university will have to give you residency."
"7005440","7007980"," It's like one of these archaic federal laws. "
"7008980","7016360"," So she picked an MOS that was available, and then she moved to that state and she, after her dad"
"7016360","7017000"," cut her off."
"7017000","7021840"," For, for fucking off, she paid her own way through college."
"7022180","7022860"," Got a degree and everything. "
"7024240","7029580"," But her dad cut her off, who was like, he was like, no more, no more loafing off my money."
"7030800","7037480"," So she did eight years in the army, reserves, and paid for college that way."
"7038540","7042580"," And like that down the hatches went to college a total of five years because of that. "
"7042740","7044820"," So her first year was like burned to the ground."
"7045400","7048380"," And then went to, and finally got her degree."
"7059040","7059920"," Varsity pickleball. "
"7064630","7070290"," Yeah, yeah, that's what she did."
"7072010","7077010"," And the crazy part was that her dad offered her as long as you perform, I'll pay for your college."
"7078370","7079430"," She's like, damn it. "
"7079430","7082410"," And of course she was like, she was the oldest."
"7083410","7085750"," And you know, her is first born."
"7086930","7088890"," And she was like, he's never going to cut me off. "
"7089010","7089830"," He loves me too much."
"7090750","7091850"," And he cut her off."
"7096130","7098270"," Yeah, she has perseverance. "
"7098430","7102130"," She's a very, very strong, very strong person."
"7103470","7104950"," I'm not the boss in my family."
"7105990","7115930"," We keep saying my kid just tells me about all the"
"7115930","7118830"," products he has been marketed to in TikTok. "

"7488120","7491640"," I don't care if you want to be, I don't know, a roofer or a custodian."
"7492240","7494860"," Whatever that is, we're going to focus on that."
"7497000","7503740"," And, but I, what I don't want you to do is like, this is just like peak, or I hope"
"7503740","7505780"," that you don't do is just peak in high school. "
"7506580","7511680"," That's daily says title, credit conditions may be aching to one to two rate hikes."
"7512420","7513460"," We'll get left behind."
"7514020","7517040"," That was a big fear of ours was, do you get left behind?"
"7517280","7520960"," I remember, I remember when I was in school one or two more rate hikes. "
"7521580","7525960"," I remember when I was in school, there was like, even in the, into like the fifth grade, what I"
"7525960","7527100"," was when I first noticed it."
"7528420","7532820"," Like, when I went into fifth grade, I can actually remember going into fifth grade and I was"
"7532820","7533160"," scared."
"7534040","7537480"," Going into fifth grade and it looked so ominous to me. "
"7538880","7543780"," And you could see that some children, some of my peers were prepared for fifth grade and some"
"7543780","7544260"," weren't."
"7545280","7548120"," Then I really started to notice it in junior high school."
"7550240","7553280"," But no one told me, this is really weird. "
"7553340","7557240"," I just had this conversation with my youngest daughter, as a matter of fact, I just had this"
"7557240","7557460"," conversation."
"7558240","7559360"," I'd had it with my oldest daughter."
"7559520","7561140"," I'd just recently had it with my youngest daughter. "
"7563580","7566340"," And the conversation went like this."
"7566640","7573280"," I was like, you know, when I was in grade school and into seventh and eighth grade, no one really"
"7573280","7574580"," tells you an adult."
"7575460","7577440"," It doesn't really tell you anything. "
"7577500","7581040"," Your parents might, you know, I think they have guidance counselors."
"7581240","7583540"," I think I remember guidance counselors in sixth, seventh, eighth grade."
"7583540","7585120"," My guidance counselor is at that time. "
"7585500","7589600"," But Staley says it's hard to figure out what is it slowing the US economy right now?"
"7590240","7594100"," Like you kind of knew they were important, but you kind of, you didn't, kind of didn't care about"
"7594100","7594500"," them as much."
"7594500","7595540"," They didn't mean anything."
"7595960","7600500"," The guidance counselor, like as a child, I didn't know what they meant to me. "
"7601800","7608880"," But what was fascinating was when I became a junior or excuse me, a freshman in high school, it was"
"7608880","7613900"," the first time that I realized that you get separated."
"7614740","7615640"," And that's okay."
"7616000","7617840"," Like if you get separated, it's fine. "
"7618140","7621280"," Like, but that's the first time an adult actually tells you."
"7622920","7629180"," You're going into these general education classes, or you're going into these college prep classes,"
"7629780","7632220"," or you're going into these honors classes."
"7632800","7636040"," So in 10 minutes time, I would do get the three and sixth month bill auction. "
"7636360","7641660"," So the US selling $57 billion of three month bills of a private bid's cover of two to 79 and"
"7641660","7644820"," a prior high yield of five spot at zero, six percent as well."
"7644960","7650420"," The US selling $54 billion of six month bills of a private cover of two to 61 and a prior"
"7650420","7653020"," high yield of four spot and 98 percent as well."
"7653160","7655090"," We do expect the comments from Germany's chancellor Scholz. "
"7656860","7661460"," And when that happens when you're a freshman in high school, I remember some of my friends were"
"7661460","7666900"," like, some of my friends, like we were all just friends in junior high and high and then junior"
"7666900","7668560"," high and before that, like getting to high school."
"7670140","7672080"," There was like a track for you."
"7672680","7678620"," Some of my friends that were in the general education track were fine with it. "
"7678760","7680260"," They were like, I don't care."
"7680640","7682040"," I'm going to go to tech school and become a mechanic."
"7682580","7684660"," I'm going to have a blast in high school, right?"
"7685980","7689060"," And then I'm going to go and become a mechanic someday. "
"7690120","7691640"," And they did very well in life."
"7691640","7694060"," It's just seeing an update of our resources here."
"7694180","7699860"," So, feds, Boston and feds barking now slated to speak at 1130 AME since I'm just under 10 minutes"
"7699860","7700320"," away now. "
"7701260","7702840"," They did very well in life."
"7703500","7707600"," Even to this day, as I've checked back on them over the years, they've done very well."
"7708480","7709420"," They knew what they were doing. "
"7709700","7711000"," They knew what their future was."
"7711220","7712420"," They knew what their plan was."
"7713840","7718480"," I had other friends that were put into general education in high school. "
"7718640","7722100"," I don't know what they call it now, but I think it was like Gen Ed or something."
"7722740","7724920"," They called these classes and they were upset."
"7725220","7727780"," They were like, well, I'm not a, I don't want to take Gen Ed. "
"7729740","7731780"," And they had a real tough go of high school."
"7732460","7735620"," They weren't prepared to take those calls for classes."
"7736240","7741380"," And then they had kids that took college prep and you had kids that took honors through high"
"7741380","7741620"," school. "
"7741880","7744020"," And then you see like kids take different tracks, right?"
"7744440","7746080"," Some kids are like peeking in high school."
"7746180","7751480"," Some kids are just grinding through high school to get where they need to go next into college."
"7752320","7754700"," And that's why I just had the conversation with my youngest daughter. "
"7754880","7761240"," I'm like, you know, your mom is going to tell you everything is great and your teachers are going"
"7761240","7762160"," to tell you everything is great."
"7762160","7764240"," That's what he says should be mindful."
"7764840","7766540"," Policy likes could show up at any time. "
"7767700","7774000"," But if you're telling me that you want to be this person when you get older, you have a lot"
"7774000","7775000"," of hard work in front of you."
"7775280","7780700"," Like you think you're going to take college level classes in high school."
"7780700","7785480"," If you think you're going to, like you're telling me you want to go to college, telling me that you"
"7785480","7786760"," want to have all this nice stuff. "
"7788120","7791460"," You're telling me you're not going to be a underwater basket weaver."
"7792020","7798020"," You're not going to take a, I don't know, surfing as a major then, you know, like I want to"
"7798020","7801580"," go work with animals on the beach or something as a biologist daddy."
"7801760","7806040"," I'm like, okay, well, you know, you need to be doing that work right now at this age. "
"7806680","7811960"," So when you get it by the time you get to high school, you're not being parked in general"
"7811960","7812380"," education."
"7813680","7814900"," You're going to have a hard time."
"7815120","7815820"," It's going to be difficult. "
"7820060","7821220"," It's like, is that what you want to do?"
"7821320","7822120"," And she's like, yes, daddy."
"7822420","7823000"," I'm like, okay."
"7823980","7826740"," Let's look at your test scores once again because they just got tested. "
"7827440","7828620"," And she does great."
"7828860","7831040"," She's, she's in a high level."
"7831040","7834380"," But I'm like, eh, we could work on these things, couldn't we?"
"7834380","7836720"," We could work on learning how to essay right. "
"7838580","7839960"," We could do that work, couldn't win."
"7840100","7840640"," She's like, yep."
"7841200","7842540"," I'm like, okay, let's work on that. "
"7846000","7848540"," I'm like, I'm like, what about this scientific method stuff?"
"7848800","7851500"," Looks like you're, you're not quite there on that stuff."
"7851700","7854600"," I'm like, we'll have to start focusing on that if that's what you want to do."
"7870400","7878800"," Yeah, my, my brother-in-law, my brother, the case in point, my brother-in-law became a plumber. "
"7879340","7881400"," He makes a fuck ton of money."
"7882500","7885280"," He has the first company he worked for."
"7885420","7886760"," He's now a partners with that guy. "
"7887420","7888300"," And he's rich."
"7889040","7890080"," Not rich, he's very well off."
"7891560","7893240"," He makes a lot of money. "
"7893520","7894480"," A lot more than you think."
"7897060","7901920"," But he went to, he got out of high school, hung out with his friends, partied, had a great time,"
"7902660","7907740"," enjoyed all of his teenage years, went to became a apprentice, went to school for that, worked his"
"7907740","7912620"," butt off all day long as an apprentice, and then went to school all night long until like 9, 30,"
"7912680","7913140"," 10 at night."
"7913960","7918920"," And just worked his ass off for a bunch of years and did the right thing. "
"7919360","7920180"," This is what I want to be."
"7920660","7921320"," This is what I want to do."
"7921960","7926880"," And now you look, you look at him today and he smokes a lot of people with what they make"
"7926880","7927220"," for money. "
"7939910","7941690"," Yeah, I don't think you have to have a university degree."
"7942090","7944250"," I mean, it's required for some people."
"7944390","7948510"," Just under five minutes time, now we do get the three and six month bill auction to the US selling"
"7948510","7953770"," $57 billion of three month bills with a private cover of two to 79 and a prior high yield of"

"7960090","7963770"," two to 61 and a prior high yield of four spot, 98% as well. "

"7969190","7969630"," Bostik."
"7971210","7972490"," Starting to squeeze higher now."
"7973310","7975710"," Yeah, I think we'll have those anecdotal stories too, right?"
"7975970","7977150"," Like this person didn't go to school. "
"7977430","7979230"," They're rich and famous or something."
"7980090","7985230"," I think there's always those people for the best majority of people get a school."
"7985510","7988510"," You try to get a tech degree or you try to get a college degree. "
"7988510","7990710"," It's kind of like the path they're most kids."
"7995490","7997490"," The Chinese Yuan hit the session lows."
"7997890","7999510"," The US, the Chinese Yuan. "
"7999930","8003670"," Do they have like a whole company?"
"8003910","8006750"," It's like a bunch of people working for him."
"8007090","8007750"," He's a filthy rich."

"8033430","8034350"," I got some friends, man."
"8034530","8036090"," They didn't do the right thing. "
"8036250","8037870"," I got some real close friends I grew up with."
"8038890","8040370"," I care about these people."
"8040650","8042630"," I care about them until I'm old and dead. "
"8043810","8049490"," I just made these long lifelong friends and I have a couple of them that made wrong decisions in"
"8049490","8049690"," life."
"8050030","8051530"," Not wrong, but they peaked in high school."
"8051530","8053210"," They didn't go to tech school. "
"8054770","8061370"," One of them worked concrete his entire life as a laborer and then of course moving up the chain but"
"8061370","8063130"," still was back breaking work."
"8063650","8065030"," He's broken down today."
"8066330","8071710"," He would probably won't live to be like a ripe old age. "
"8075150","8076380"," He admits it to me."
"8076380","8079620"," I talk about it and stuff and he's broken down."
"8080580","8084760"," Hard labor took a lot of the rest of his life away from him. "
"8093070","8096890"," There's nothing wrong with hard labor, but you do that long enough."
"8097130","8097990"," It catches up to you."
"8098170","8099210"," It can catch up to you. "
"8099630","8100230"," That's what I've been told."
"8110900","8112320"," Not much going on right here."
"8112440","8113560"," I'm watching the VIX go down. "
"8113800","8115980"," It's testing its hourly trigger right now."
"8115980","8122260"," It's $16.99. We'll see if they can break through or not."
"8122300","8123900"," And long credit tightening will be. "
"8138420","8142960"," Yeah, there's some that do well, but let's not candy coat it."
"8143880","8149860"," We don't think we are either, but don't candy coat it because there are people that they get."
"8150260","8159080"," There's a large percentage of Americans that either don't have insurance or don't have a 401k or a"
"8159080","8159240"," pound. "
"8162600","8167700"," They work their working poor for most of their lives and some of them get fucked, right?"
"8168000","8168740"," That's what happens."
"8186170","8191090"," Fedsteady says the FMC deciding meeting by meeting is more of a prudent path."
"8192450","8207150"," I'm trying"
"8207150","8208290"," to read what Deli's saying here. "
"8209190","8212410"," No sign of a text released for Fed's Bostic and Fed's Barkin."
"8224760","8227120"," Yeah, more just painting the walls with Deli here."

"8238809","8242930"," My mom says that there's not that's not the only profession either."
"8243110","8245049"," It has a tough right or I don't know."
"8245389","8250969"," So my mom's a nurse practitioner and she felt is for a long time. "
"8252309","8257870"," She was an RN and she said that her eating habits were horrible."
"8258230","8262770"," Maybe any of you guys have worked in a hospital setting and a test of that like long shift."
"8262809","8264129"," She would work three days a week. "
"8264670","8269430"," I remember that when I was a kid she worked like three days a week long hours, always on her"
"8269430","8269670"," feet."
"8272030","8279150"," And she got paid bank, but she said that she gave up a lot of her health."
"8281850","8282850"," For eating poorly. "
"8283129","8285250"," She'd be like, yeah, he just grabbed something out of a vending machine."
"8286110","8289850"," And you just keep working so your choices weren't always the best."
"8297770","8298730"," What do you think here?"
"8298830","8299430"," I think we're gonna go higher. "
"8301209","8303950"," Some resolution, the upside's a little bit of a bull flag right here."
"8305370","8307250"," We're not flag but a bull cross."
"8308610","8310410"," This is the one minute chart right now. "
"8311770","8313709"," And see the bull cross right here."
"8321309","8322809"," Click on the five minute chart."
"8324629","8327270"," Prices above the five minute right now. "
"8331530","8336190"," Twice this morning you've seen sellers come in on that five minute and try to slam it down."
"8338750","8341070"," Like false starts to the upside here."
"8342410","8344430"," Though prices bullish right now. "
"8344430","8347730"," Two to fifty six and a high yield of five spot to five percent."
"8347730","8349010"," Five spot to five percent."
"8349309","8351990"," So the U.S. sells sixty three billion dollars of three month bills. "
"8352450","8354730"," And the world's thirty six spot five nine percent of bids at high."
"8355129","8356650"," Euro close right now as well."
"8361809","8364430"," Vick's trying to hold its pants up right now in the hourly. "
"8366570","8367629"," Doesn't want to give it up."
"8385010","8386629"," That's a regret my mother had."
"8387410","8392310"," She's lives very healthy now in her older age, but she was always regretful of that. "
"8393030","8396890"," Said that she was angry at how poor her."
"8397050","8402590"," Two to ninety six and a high rate of five spot one seven percent five spot one seven percent."
"8402810","8406910"," So the U.S. selling at sixty billion dollars of six month bills and the world's seventy five spot"
"8406910","8408390"," eight three percent of bids at high. "
"8409230","8413210"," Like the VIX doesn't want to give it up here, but looking at the spy on the trigger."
"8413410","8415410"," It just looks like it wants to rip some faces off."
"8421330","8437230"," Third state"

"8476200","8479480"," I can be hot cold do things with light, but I have to poop and shower."
"8480300","8482520"," Yeah, I went over Tesla this morning."
"8483540","8485460"," I believe at nine. "
"8487400","8491400"," Nine thirties nine forty five somewhere there went over Tesla nine forty five I think."
"8493300","8494840"," One of our NVIDIA Tesla."
"8497740","8499800"," Our spies grinding right now. "
"8500620","8501960"," I think the cues real quick."
"8504400","8505480"," Cues grinding."
"8511960","8514000"," Climb in the world wall of worry. "
"8514880","8515560"," That's what it looks like."
"8526210","8528410"," If VIX can break below."
"8530050","8531650"," Sixteen ninety six. "
"8532490","8533550"," Should see a squeeze."
"8537450","8538690"," Climbing the wall of worry."
"8538810","8540090"," That's what all this looks like to me. "
"8542390","8547730"," Or be or I guess if you're a bear you're probably thinking they're just waiting to pull the rug on"
"8547730","8548150"," us, right?"
"8548630","8552330"," I'm assuming if you're if you're a bear you're like just waiting to pull the rug."
"8560190","8564250"," Yeah, I'm still in a trade on IWM right now still sitting on IWM."
"8567830","8570090"," Still still long on small caps. "
"8572210","8574830"," I don't like the idea of the timing on that shit like."
"8576370","8580970"," I like the idea of the market rolling over, but I don't like it right now."

"8840490","8846270"," Best thing bulls have going for themselves right now on Tesla is the daily velocity."
"8847950","8850850"," It was on Max bearishness down here. "

"8945650","8950350"," If you're asking me if I think we get up there I already told you my phrase target was three"

"9024690","9028410"," I wouldn't be short Tesla Tesla can easily break above that one eighty five here."
"9028990","9030310"," I wouldn't be short Tesla here. "
"9034750","9040290"," Well Tesla's trending no reason to be shorting it as the day they are printed."
"9040910","9044290"," When Tesla's velocity is at plus fifty that's when you short Tesla."
"9045030","9046630"," It's an easy trade. "
"9047630","9052650"," But whenever I like Tesla's velocity is at minus fifty stay the fuck out of the way until it gets"
"9052650","9053430"," to plus fifty."
"9054570","9059990"," Or plus twenty five at least even start considering shorting Tesla it's not it's not the thing to"

"9080170","9083010"," have a higher probability of shorting Tesla. "
"9086870","9091090"," How how do you guys think that gets even worse the AI stuff."

"11438310","11440250"," A lot of the clearly is market after the squeeze."
"11442090","11447010"," I think my own take on this is that the in moment that it's that it's announced that it's the"
"11447010","11448470"," deal is made we squeeze up."
"11449710","11451170"," And then we roll over. "
"11458970","11461370"," I think the 401ks won't even feel it."
"11461530","11463790"," I think it'll be like bump in the road."
"11464250","11465570"," I think the stock market will feel it but. "
"11467210","11469590"," And then we get the initial squeeze and then it's roll it."
"11472190","11474150"," I say that but then I'm like yeah."
"11474930","11478270"," I mean if we were at 4300 and we got the debt market deal was done. "
"11478410","11481270"," I'd be like yeah sell it all right now right now right where we are."
"11484430","11487310"," I don't think you get the squeeze on debt ceiling talks."
"11488230","11489730"," If we're trading 4300. "
"11490410","11491450"," I think we just sell the news."
"11492810","11493730"," So chase saying."
"11496770","11500890"," The market is going to dump hard on debt ceiling resolution a lot of the clearly is market after"
"11500890","11501230"," the squeeze. "
"11502410","11503950"," After the squeeze they see what you're saying."
"11504910","11507630"," I think they were on the same same page on that one will chase."
"11508030","11511930"," So we're now five minutes away from the bottom of the hour but we're expecting comments from German"
"11511930","11513110"," finance minister Linda. "
"11517630","11521730"," It's like they always feel like it's like you tell me the price and I'll tell you what the news"
"11521730","11522330"," is going to be."

"11575510","11578610"," I don't care what the news is that gets us to 4,300."
"11579070","11580970"," But like it gets there one way or another. "
"11583690","11589070"," I don't care if it's like 4,300 then debt ceiling news drops and we trade down from there or."
"11590030","11593770"," We're trading 4,200 and then we get a squeeze to 43 and then sell from there."
"11595590","11600240"," I think price kind of matters here. "
"11600600","11602540"," I think you would have already seen the firm running of selling to."
"11604300","11605640"," I think you would have seen it."
"11605820","11608980"," I think you like would have seen that ping on 420 and then immediate selling. "
"11609900","11611120"," Into that debt ceiling news."
"11618750","11621130"," Yeah we have what do we have."

"11634250","11636070"," We look at it just like we look at."
"11637630","11639050"," We're looking at it just like. "
"11639490","11641790"," Remember when Tesla was like we're going to trade to 420."
"11643570","11647330"," And it was just just just lower than 420 right a few dollars before."
"11649290","11652490"," Like you promised everybody 430 and then a few dollars in. "
"11653110","11654150"," Wham they just nail you."
"11658140","11661300"," We think it's somewhere in there too before we actually get to that number."
"11681230","11682910"," No there should be a squeeze. "
"11684510","11685430"," There should be a squeeze."
"11685930","11687030"," Well there should be."
"11687210","11688870"," If we're trading 427 or 428. "
"11689990","11691090"," I don't think we get the squeeze."
"11701490","11705610"," And the only other thing I guess if you're more upside than that than if you're like."
"11705990","11708870"," I don't I don't believe to cap like 427 or 428. "
"11711870","11714670"," We should we haven't done the math but what is that."

"15549600","15550720"," I'm probably picks them up at like 12."
"15551000","15558830"," Yeah, that's what I'm looking at too winky I'm interested in it down there too How often in stock"
"15558830","15565990"," market do we get back to red years back to back red years very rare That's a good question I"
"15565990","15583050"," got some cool for you guys I miss that i'll let you see what he just said Dixie"
"15583050","15592940"," fell off for a minute there Let's uh, you know some of"
"15592940","15598860"," it's kind of fascinating like a simple way to to answer that question It's a good it's a good"
"15598860","15616230"," question and how do I simplify that for people In"
"15616230","15617770"," tight we'll we'll look at it. "
"15648750","15650170"," It's a very good question."
"15656410","15674320"," I have an answer to that This"
"15674320","15676620"," is the Dow Jones industrial average."
"15677480","15686100"," Uh, this is going all the way back to 1897 It's an important one to look at for two reasons. "
"15686420","15694340"," This is a 12 month chart On the Dow Jones industrial average There's two key points to make here."
"15694840","15696940"," You don't see many red bars here."
"15697100","15697320"," Do you?"
"15698920","15708080"," And even on these red bars there was a buyable dip so Even though you see a red bar here"
"15708800","15711040"," You see that they tried to buy it, right?"
"15711460","15715300"," There's another one where they tried to buy it There's another one where they tried to buy it. "
"15715380","15720200"," So the idea here is even when you get a red year You'll see a dip buyers will show up,"
"15720360","15720420"," right?"
"15721620","15729400"," Uh, this is 2000 This is 2008 There's one big red bar, right?"
"15729400","15732920"," I mean, they're just they're rare as my points."
"15732920","15734480"," You don't see many of them."
"15734680","15743080"," You don't see many of them like one two three Um There there are rare occurrence historically there"
"15743080","15751140"," are rare occurrence Um We just had a major one is my point here Uh, this was we had two"
"15751140","15751860"," major ones, right?"
"15752420","15754220"," We had uh, we had this one back here. "
"15754260","15764260"," This was 2020 Um, and it got Really bought right uh 2021 though first red bar in many years, uh,"
"15764660","15772160"," one two three four years, this is even pre-covid And what do you see happening?"
"15773100","15780860"," On this year is it's it's currently being bought Uh, so how often do we see those those major red"
"15780860","15787600"," bars not too frequently And when they are did they when that previous 12 months was a red year?"
"15788660","15790340"," Uh, it's it's not too frequent."
"15790600","15796780"," It's infrequent And there's probably a dip to buy even if the next one is red There's like a dip"
"15796780","15807150"," to buy that year is the point That's not that frequent it's a good question The"
"15807150","15814230"," odds are on your side That if you had a red year though your your second year the odds are"
"15814230","15822090"," in your favor Uh, that it's not going to be a red year Not guaranteed but if you're looking at"
"15822090","15837450"," probability Good question by the way I"
"15837450","15846610"," think what I think the key point here is um, can you expect more red years after yes Um Like"
"15846610","15854230"," if we're looking at just like the probability when you have a bad year like so If like you got"
"15854230","15859910"," like Larry Williams is great at this right he's like um He's like on average this month is your"
"15859910","15866210"," best month on average this month is your worst month And then if you let's say you're on your on"
"15866210","15871430"," your best month right let's say let's say you say mayor's our best month of the year For returns"
"15871430","15877210"," let's say mayor's one of our best months Of the year for returns And you make that statement right"
"15877210","15885990"," you're like breakout, uh 24 or 48 previous mays And you go look all these all these mays we did"
"15885990","15894450"," great Um So it's already on your side right that's a great month Now if you have mostly great"
"15894450","15900750"," months in may if you have one really bad may Uh, you're probably or probability of having the next"
"15900750","15906910"," may be really good Is it gets even better right you're gonna your probability of having a better"
"15906910","15919040"," may of that next year is even better Um Which has proved itself this year so far, right Now"
"15919040","15922980"," we did have a good summer last year didn't we we had a we had a run last summer, right"
"15923800","15927760"," Uh Uh, so do we give a bad summer this summer?"
"15927900","15928780"," Maybe is that maybe that's your question?"
"15928980","15939290"," I don't know that's what you're looking for for a question for this summer Uh"
"15939290","15944010"," does the red bars being bought like that indicate that the dip is usually within the middle of the"
"15944010","15949090"," year give or take Or at least uh don't expect the dip to be At end of year."
"15949570","15951310"," No, there's another thing to take away from that chart. "
"15951490","15959470"," I just showed you right The third thing would be you don't oftentimes see that dip be lower than"
"15959470","15960990"," the previous ones, right?"
"15962510","15967510"," So there's like a bible dip that you can actually look back on And say it's gonna be a rare"
"15967510","15967750"," thing."
"15967890","15974910"," We even go back to that number or lower than that number Like we might see 345 again Uh, but"
"15974910","15983570"," the chances of us going to like 32 or third 28 or 16 become less and less So you start"
"15983570","15990410"," to start to renegotiate what bottom is like so and when we were at 345 the first time That was"
"15990410","15998890"," the largest exposure that we had To a failure and roll down to that 1600 2400 get a lot of"
"15998890","16005430"," exposure there Uh, but when you go back like when you've like done the 20 the 32 34 and then"
"16005430","16010970"," you're going up now to like let's say 4200 when we go back down there's a higher probability that"
"16010970","16018550"," we retest that low and then come go back up again And not roll down into the 28s and 32s"
"16018550","16030280"," and 16s It"
"16030280","16039450"," shows that there's a dip to buy it does Yeah, it's kind of wild right like so when we were"
"16039450","16046310"," at like 3450 right when we were down there If we had if we had rejected above Give you a"
"16046310","16054710"," more a more clear number, but And then another thing that we did as well was here, let me say"
"16054710","16063030"," I'm gonna bring this up Like there were some things like we can still go to the depths of hell"
"16063030","16064930"," There's not there's nothing saying we can't fail."
"16065230","16071110"," We have examples of the past of trying to make a new high And then rolling like oh yeah, we"
"16071110","16075590"," did it we checked back and then we rolled Let me say and see if I can just say this"
"16075590","16085550"," for better It's like traditional charting shit"
"16085550","16090250"," I don't like using this stuff because it really doesn't mean anything if we roll we roll we trade"
"16090250","16099220"," it But like the traders out there will say things like oh, it's doing this or it did that or"
"16099220","16102760"," this is extremely bearish This is extremely bullish that kind of stuff. "
"16103120","16104920"," So just SPX right here, right?"
"16105500","16110240"," If you're just like a just like basic charting right like charting one-on-one stuff, right?"
"16111180","16118700"," It's kind of a big deal here Like you have negative trend right negative downward trend Most of our"
"16118700","16119800"," risk was down in here."
"16119800","16127900"," We also had some major risk over here So if we had a failure Anywhere in here, that's bad, right"
"16129060","16131760"," That's like trend still down, right?"
"16131760","16141720"," Uh When we came above we blasted above this downward channel and we retested That's bullish right"
"16141720","16151590"," if you're a traditional chartist um, so like We break trend down"
"16151590","16155890"," trend major downtrend we check it again And what were we told here?"
"16156930","16161590"," We were told the move is higher That's what we were told There's demand here."
"16161590","16163330"," We're not done yet, right?"
"16164090","16171390"," Major demand stepped in it's a big indicator right here that we're not done to the upside It's also"
"16171390","16177230"," telling you that this demand is stronger than this sell That makes sense. "
"16177270","16185910"," So we're going to look higher now And see if that's major resistance does that make sense So we're"
"16185910","16186790"," going to look higher now."
"16186790","16191210"," That's at that 430 427 Right does it make sense?"
"16192150","16198710"," We'll see if demand after we tag this or try to tag it It'll attempt to roll over and find"
"16198710","16206310"," out if demand is back down here at 380 Or if it's moved higher Has demand now moved here And"
"16206310","16216850"," is the sell there does that make sense we trade this until we find out It"
"16216850","16223830"," makes sense like we're just on a larger time frame um That kind of stuff now does that mean you"
"16223830","16224610"," can't can't go lower?"
"16224710","16230010"," No, we can go lower Here, but even though we can go lower here just just looking at basic like"
"16230010","16235530"," major support major supply Um, we went down and checked we went down here."
"16235950","16238350"," We went down here on on march 15th. "
"16238350","16244270"," We checked We were told fuck now we're going up So we're going to go back up again and check"
"16244270","16250970"," to see if there are as many sellers above we have more demand Uh from this dip buy down here."
"16251170","16255730"," So we're going to go up here and check this we're going up here I'm almost not guaranteed, but"
"16255730","16264170"," highly likelihood Uh, we're going to go up here to see if these sellers are still here um We roll"
"16264170","16271970"," back down and underneath sure but for right now, uh, you know, this isn't bearish bearish would"
"16271970","16278550"," have been this right here, right bearish would have been uh, the rejection The bearish would have"
"16278550","16280450"," been the failure that's bearish."
"16280530","16281490"," That's when you're like fuck me, man. "
"16281590","16285710"," We're fucked We're going down We're going to go down and we're going to break this 345."
"16286250","16287410"," We're going to get out and check out 32."
"16287510","16292530"," We're going to check out 28 Right there is that would have been the tell so right now the tell"
"16292530","16302510"," is to the upside Uh and check above makes sense Fairly simple Um You know, and if that's"
"16302510","16305250"," where it is and we're going to roll this over and go right to the down of the depths of"
"16305250","16306750"," hell So be it will first though. "
"16306850","16312350"," We're definitely checking here We're definitely checking this 3800 We want to see if these buyers"
"16312350","16317790"," are still here And this would be your next new next target down here."
"16317970","16324550"," They might be hiding out here, but likely Uh, if we reject above here, this is our first real check"
"16324550","16334510"," right there We're going up No matter what anybody"
"16334510","16335050"," tells you."
"16335130","16337250"," Well, I don't know there they could be some market news. "
"16337490","16344090"," We don't know or Some fucking reason to crash or whatever Maybe we don't hit the exact number Maybe"
"16344090","16356010"," they just step in or something and they're just like doom doom doom Max short right here Yeah,"
"16356110","16357070"," we're going up there to check man."
"16357210","16366510"," Wait, we are you know, we're going up there to check it's 42 5.86 on spx We're close But"
"16366510","16370310"," the algorithms they like to go up there man those algorithms are like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo"
"16370310","16375500"," you know They got they got pre-planned numbers."
"16375500","16385340"," They're going to go check That was probably the key date so Uh march 13th That was the day"
"16385340","16392320"," where you knew Uh for this run specifically that was the confirmation We're going up. "
"16392540","16412189"," We're going higher The dip was bought get out of the way As"
"16414590","16421570"," we go up from here If we reverse they'll likely be a sell up there, right?"
"16421750","16426710"," There's likely going to be Some seller rage up there car lichens up there going."
"16426710","16438130"," I'm going to sell right into that And that's"
"16438130","16445770"," why I think them the news matters here I think that's why I think there's like this like You know,"
"16445869","16450750"," like if we get that ceiling news and we trade to four four two seven four two eight four three"
"16450750","16460849"," zero Above four three zero and that news brings us there And they roll it there You're"
"16460849","16463390"," for what one Ks are likely fine, right?"
"16477009","16478330"," It's not just algorithms."
"16478790","16481070"," There's like it we talk about this in the show a lot. "
