"jJUMNib-H18","0","11360"," Happy Sunday Twitter fam, Captain Jim James here with your weekly brief for December 13, 2021."
"jJUMNib-H18","11360","16160"," So I want to start off by saying that I hope that you get this video before morning."
"jJUMNib-H18","16160","22800"," I live near where those torn or close enough to where those tornadoes were that we had"
"jJUMNib-H18","22800","29600"," windstorms that wound up knocking power and internet out to us intermittently over the past"
"jJUMNib-H18","29600","36320"," two days. So I've made this video I think three times at this point and I've had uploads fail."
"jJUMNib-H18","37040","42160"," So hopefully you get this video and we're going to start this video off by looking at the economic"
"jJUMNib-H18","42160","48720"," calendar and we know that we have got no events on Monday. We have got PPI on Tuesday on Wednesday"
"jJUMNib-H18","48720","53760"," retail sales Thursday claims and continuing claims nothing on the docket for Friday."
"jJUMNib-H18","54560","62080"," I'm sure at this point everyone knows about the FOMC on Wednesday or at least the presser"
"jJUMNib-H18","62080","66720"," at 2.30 in the afternoon and that's really what you need to concern yourself with. Jerome Powell"
"jJUMNib-H18","66720","72240"," is going to come out hold a presser and talk to us about monetary policy heading into the upcoming"
"jJUMNib-H18","72240","78960"," year and ad nauseam I'm sure that everyone is talking about this everywhere. Sometimes you"
"jJUMNib-H18","78960","84640"," get in the rabbit hole or sometimes you get in that box and you don't know what to believe anymore."
"jJUMNib-H18","84640","89520"," When in reality as an investor a swing trader a day trader although the only thing you really"
"jJUMNib-H18","89520","98400"," need to know is are they going to increase or accelerate tapering in December and what if any"
"jJUMNib-H18","98880","104240"," rate increases we get in 2022. We know we have one bank that was saying that we're not getting"
"jJUMNib-H18","104240","109280"," any rate increases. We have another bank that's saying we're getting two if not three. A bunch of"
"jJUMNib-H18","109280","116720"," other banks believed that and we actually priced in two rate increases in 2022. So what does that"
"jJUMNib-H18","116720","123040"," mean? Well we know that Jay Powell has told us that he would telegraph before any major announcements"
"jJUMNib-H18","123040","129680"," during this time period. We also know that the market has been kept up during this time period."
"jJUMNib-H18","129680","135280"," We also know that the president came out and said hey inflation's going away. Shortages are"
"jJUMNib-H18","135280","141200"," going away. You can see it. I mean two is or two their credit somewhat. There have been lesser"
"jJUMNib-H18","141200","146560"," gas prices. Some of the shortages are relieving. Some people are going back to work. They do this"
"jJUMNib-H18","146560","153200"," doesn't need to improve. Yes did we see worse CPI numbers this week? No we got the expected"
"jJUMNib-H18","153200","158000"," numbers. I was expecting even higher they didn't come. So you have to somewhat give them the"
"jJUMNib-H18","158000","164000"," benefit of the doubt. You know if those numbers were worse that the potential for rate increases"
"jJUMNib-H18","164000","169920"," was definitely on the table. So at this moment I'm going to give them the pass and I'm going to"
"jJUMNib-H18","169920","176160"," expect on Wednesday that tapering runs on the same schedule. I'm going to expect that if we"
"jJUMNib-H18","176160","183040"," even get any rates guaranteed on this FOMC that it's no more than two. Possibly even one with a"
"jJUMNib-H18","183040","189360"," revisit next year and we might not even get rates announced that this FOMC. In either way that's"
"jJUMNib-H18","189360","196400"," all priced in. So let's say they gave us the worst news ever. It would have to be three rate hikes,"
"jJUMNib-H18","197200","204880"," aggressive tapering into December. I just don't see it at this point for what's showing in the"
"jJUMNib-H18","204880","209920"," market. It's not priced into the market at this point. That would be a move that I would have"
"jJUMNib-H18","209920","216320"," expected pre-COVID. So what do I do in this market as a trader? Well I'm going to trade the markets"
"jJUMNib-H18","216320","221120"," that's in front of me with what we know as supports and resistance levels at this point."
"jJUMNib-H18","221840","227280"," And then I'm also going to be putting some protection on whenever we're at highs from now"
"jJUMNib-H18","227280","233840"," into FOMC. My expectation is that we're going to trade up this week and then we might fall back"
"jJUMNib-H18","234160","240400"," it may come down to a support level and then go to all-time highs into the 31st of December."
"jJUMNib-H18","240400","245040"," That's what I think is going to happen. That's how I've been trading and I think that most of you"
"jJUMNib-H18","245040","251040"," are following along with me trading in the same fashion. Now while this is going on I have to make"
"jJUMNib-H18","251040","255920"," a note that I know that there are index bears getting wrecked out there and I know that there"
"jJUMNib-H18","255920","261600"," are bull or stock bulls that are getting wrecked out there. If you start to look at the whole market"
"jJUMNib-H18","261600","266880"," there is a great rebalancing that's been taking place leading up to our OPEX this month."
"jJUMNib-H18","266880","272320"," And so what you're seeing is that COVID trade is being taken for profit, right? The banks are"
"jJUMNib-H18","272320","277600"," taking profit on the COVID trade. They're propping the market up at the same time. They could have"
"jJUMNib-H18","277600","284320"," dropped the market and kept it dropped right into FOMC. What happens though in that trade is let's"
"jJUMNib-H18","284320","290640"," say we don't raise rates on Wednesday you start to see more attractive stocks and even if it's only"
"jJUMNib-H18","290640","296560"," four or two or three weeks and we can pump up this market you know Tesla could hold the"
"jJUMNib-H18","296560","302880"," market up if Apple sold up and I had price projections of Apple hitting 190 before end of year."
"jJUMNib-H18","302880","308560"," I think that's still possibly on the table at this point. So I wouldn't let this market go just now"
"jJUMNib-H18","308560","313440"," and then you would be surprised if we have a doubt let's say we have a down January to March"
"jJUMNib-H18","313440","319120"," and Apple eventually does sell down Tesla and some of the high-flying big tech stocks sell down"
"jJUMNib-H18","319760","324160"," in springtime you're going to take a look at the stock market and find that everything has been"
"jJUMNib-H18","324160","329920"," rebalanced that profits have been taken from your favorite stocks. That big tech is now at a better"
"jJUMNib-H18","329920","334640"," price and the market was able to take profits at the end of this year. So that's what I see"
"jJUMNib-H18","334640","339040"," happening and I'm going to trade that happening and with protection I think I'll trade right"
"jJUMNib-H18","339040","344240"," through all this with no issues and I'm going to make another video later once I know for sure I"
"jJUMNib-H18","344400","348880"," have power so that I can talk about some individual stocks with you guys out there"
"jJUMNib-H18","348880","353040"," so that you feel more confident and safe. If you're one of those long-term investors"
"jJUMNib-H18","353040","357360"," the only thing you need to be doing right now is hold your position that you're in and take"
"jJUMNib-H18","357360","361760"," longer protection at one to three months. If you're a day trader you should be grabbing protection"
"jJUMNib-H18","361760","368160"," along the way and respect, establish, support, and resistance lines. Now we're going to look"
"jJUMNib-H18","368160","373440"," at the spy chart over here and this is the one month chart here. Now looking into last week"
"jJUMNib-H18","373520","378240"," right we were in balance last week and we knew where our support was. We knew it was between"
"jJUMNib-H18","378240","385600"," 465 and 466. We knew that the buy of the dip was really down at 4640 and then we could go"
"jJUMNib-H18","385600","392960"," deeper to 4600 without volatility until we hit 4500. We know we're in a positive gamma environment"
"jJUMNib-H18","392960","397760"," that the market should go up, that liquidity should step in. We know where the sellers are"
"jJUMNib-H18","397760","404800"," hiding. We knew they were above it for 70 but until Friday we also know that the hero indicator"
"jJUMNib-H18","404800","410480"," souped straight up into the sky which meant that dealers were removing higher hedges into the"
"jJUMNib-H18","410480","416240"," clothes and that was important. When we bought here on the seventh was important, the eighth was"
"jJUMNib-H18","416240","422800"," important and then specifically on the ninth what happened was we were selling off and we talked"
"jJUMNib-H18","422880","428480"," about on Twitter I'm going to buy that clothes even if it's the last minute no matter where it is"
"jJUMNib-H18","428480","434080"," and I was hoping for 4640 because I'm a greedy bull. I didn't get it but I did get the trade on"
"jJUMNib-H18","434080","439360"," out the clothes and sure enough we traded right up to this open right here into Friday and that's"
"jJUMNib-H18","439360","444800"," where the cards were tipped where is the open because when we sold off we picked it right back"
"jJUMNib-H18","444800","449680"," up at that same support area and we traded up the rest of the day straight into the clothes."
"jJUMNib-H18","449760","455200"," We ended up slamming on another 40 points right at the clothes on Friday so Thursday's that or"
"jJUMNib-H18","455200","461280"," the whole week's action combined to the action into clothes Friday leads you to believe that"
"jJUMNib-H18","461280","466640"," we're going to make a run at all time highs and so what does that mean heading into Monday?"
"jJUMNib-H18","466640","472320"," Well it means we're going to go to a smaller time frame here and that means let's let's see"
"jJUMNib-H18","472320","479120"," if we lift this closer. That means that we're going to try trying to make a run at 473.53"
"jJUMNib-H18","479120","484480"," it says 51 here but we know that the cash all time high is 53 but we're going to make a run at that"
"jJUMNib-H18","485600","491120"," if you're a bull you want the banks to do the work we talk about this right we run it up to where"
"jJUMNib-H18","491120","497120"," we come to resistance we let the banks take us over and let it rest on support if you're a bear"
"jJUMNib-H18","497120","502800"," you're looking for a reaction here if you don't see a reaction you can't take that short you want"
"jJUMNib-H18","502800","508640"," to see a reaction that it's rejected right and even when it's rejected you want to see that rejection"
"jJUMNib-H18","508640","515440"," two three times if liquidity comes into the market on monday morning picks this up and sends it over"
"jJUMNib-H18","515440","521600"," you're going to be looking for support to be made and then another move up this is when you're a bull"
"jJUMNib-H18","522240","530320"," you would pick the spy back up and trade higher past all time highs i don't think we get past 476 if"
"jJUMNib-H18","530320","536320"," we do and if we might even trade sideways up here heading into f1c but i think we're green this week"
"jJUMNib-H18","536320","542400"," now let's say we reject off here you'd want to see two to three rejections for us to start to test"
"jJUMNib-H18","542400","549440"," lows in them that low though is going to be deep it's going to be somewhere around 4600 as we as we"
"jJUMNib-H18","549920","554880"," head into the rest of this week so this this is an area of concern for bulls this is an area"
"jJUMNib-H18","554880","560080"," that bears are going to want to short and in all honesty if we look at a larger time frame back"
"jJUMNib-H18","560080","569920"," on this one month it wouldn't surprise me to see us trade up here sell off and then trade back up"
"jJUMNib-H18","569920","575760"," to all time or to the 480 mark we're all looking for into the end of december so that's what i'm looking"
"jJUMNib-H18","575760","581440"," for i'm looking for a move up here let's say we get up here to all time highs we might make"
"jJUMNib-H18","581440","587440"," it slightly higher we get rejected somewhere here can't find support we sell down to this 460"
"jJUMNib-H18","587440","594080"," number possibly 4640 and then we wait for the announcement from jpow on wednesday and if all"
"jJUMNib-H18","594080","599840"," is good we trade back up to 480 if anything ugly comes out we'll start trading down to the depths"
"jJUMNib-H18","599840","604400"," of hell that's all i've got for you in spy we'll look at the iwm right now"
"jJUMNib-H18","605840","613440"," the rustle the rut rty and we talked about this earlier or later last week where i tried to explain"
"jJUMNib-H18","613440","621040"," to you that the rut and the iwm are is rate sensitive but one of the tipping points in the cards on"
"jJUMNib-H18","621040","628080"," the rut was that the rut would switch to negative gamma somewhere down here at 213 it would almost"
"jJUMNib-H18","628080","634880"," be forced to trade down to 205 so if that were to take place either last week or even this week"
"jJUMNib-H18","634880","640320"," it would crash the spy and the cues and we're getting the point right now where they're not"
"jJUMNib-H18","640320","646800"," allowing that to happen the banks are not selling out just yet iwm so what would you expect out"
"jJUMNib-H18","646800","656320"," of iwm this week i'm going to expect it to trade up to 222 or 223 heading into the fomc if fomc is bad"
"jJUMNib-H18","656320","660560"," we'll trade down to the depths of hell at that point otherwise it's going to be staying up"
"jJUMNib-H18","661520","669520"," now the cues ndx nazdak the cues have some bigger problems the volume profile on it is not pretty"
"jJUMNib-H18","669520","676000"," right now and what it is is implying is that we're going to grind in this area in here we're probably"
"jJUMNib-H18","676000","682880"," going to be down to 396 and up to 399 a couple times this week and that implies that we are"
"jJUMNib-H18","682960","688320"," whacking a lot of stocks in tech it also implies that some other stocks might be taking over to"
"jJUMNib-H18","688320","694320"," hold the market up where you see how high apple is we gave projections of almost 190 there"
"jJUMNib-H18","694320","700640"," it could probably go there before selling off but in reality it's probably close to the high"
"jJUMNib-H18","700640","706400"," arts close to the high on it right now we'll get into apple here in a minute but 190 is not out"
"jJUMNib-H18","706400","712400"," of the picture for apple a pullback if we don't make all time highs in this run is in is in the cards"
"jJUMNib-H18","712400","717040"," and specifically let's say apple goes to these crazy highs let's go to apple real quick"
"jJUMNib-H18","717760","721200"," i'll show you that one first we're going to look at apple and one of the important"
"jJUMNib-H18","721200","727040"," things about apple that this trade is that you want to look at apple let's look at apple"
"jJUMNib-H18","730480","736000"," right here and what's important about the apple trade is this is way back in 2020 at"
"jJUMNib-H18","736400","741200"," and i want you to see the direction of apple moving up here and i really want you to see"
"jJUMNib-H18","741200","747360"," is that you know if you'd bought the high here on on september of 2020 and you're bought the low"
"jJUMNib-H18","747360","753840"," here you would be right at the same price at 139 so to wait an entire year for apple to go up"
"jJUMNib-H18","754400","763600"," to 179 is really not that crazy so one last push up to 190 on the table one more thing"
"jJUMNib-H18","764240","768560"," let's say apple begins to sell off in another stock like let's say facebook"
"jJUMNib-H18","769120","773440"," starts to pick up or a net flick starts to pick up because they're coming into winter"
"jJUMNib-H18","773440","777680"," or amazon picks up what the three of them do they could carry this market through into"
"jJUMNib-H18","777680","783200"," january first no problem and let's go look at tesla real quick because tesla might have"
"jJUMNib-H18","783920","789760"," tesla might have one last breath of it as well and we talked about tesla you can see here see"
"jJUMNib-H18","789760","795200"," this see this right here to this consolidation you got another bounce down here one last push"
"jJUMNib-H18","795200","802880"," up above into april that doesn't look like it's out of the picture here for tesla either so you"
"jJUMNib-H18","802880","808320"," you saw that we did this we we traded this once already you guys traded this with me it wouldn't"
"jJUMNib-H18","808320","814800"," surprise me to see tesla trade up sell down below into this support area in the nine hundreds"
"jJUMNib-H18","814880","821680"," let's call it like 950 to 900 get picked up for one more trip up before end of before end of"
"jJUMNib-H18","821680","830000"," year into the 31st so can this market stay irrational yes can if i start to look at the market as a"
"jJUMNib-H18","830000","836400"," whole it's really starting to look a lot more a lot it's really starting to look more like"
"jJUMNib-H18","837280","842320"," the market is fully manipulated it's really looking to me like we're rebalancing"
"jJUMNib-H18","842320","847120"," it looks to me like when we head into january we might have the whole market sell off let's say"
"jJUMNib-H18","847120","852480"," by the time we get back into march you'll have all these stock stocks that'll be attractive again"
"jJUMNib-H18","852480","859360"," for people to long into next year you can see it here this is this is like the movie where"
"jJUMNib-H18","860000","865920"," the oil the oil driller sucks the milkshake of the guy next door right the bears were expecting"
"jJUMNib-H18","866480","871680"," all of these stocks to crash at the same time that didn't happen the bears were expecting"
"jJUMNib-H18","872240","878560"," for just apple to go down and crash the market at this point but in reality there's a few others"
"jJUMNib-H18","878560","884320"," out there that could prop this market up when apple does come down so this lends more credence"
"jJUMNib-H18","884320","890800"," to normal pullbacks end of year normal profit taking and then literally the market to be ready"
"jJUMNib-H18","890800","896880"," to be bought again once late winter comes into effect so i the only last thing i would leave"
"jJUMNib-H18","896960","902720"," with is if i put some protection on the save me or to protect me if we if we sell off real crazy"
