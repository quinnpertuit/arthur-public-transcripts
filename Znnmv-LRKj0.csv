"Znnmv-LRKj0","0","5000"," Good evening."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","5000","10000"," This is Captain Jim James with a special report tonight for August 18, 2021."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","10000","17000"," I, it, well, if you made money today or if you have not lost any money or you're,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","17000","21000"," if you're an old trader or you don't really lose money in events like today,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","21000","25000"," you might just want to skip forward to where you get into the nitty gritty details."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","25000","28000"," But if you lost money today, stick around."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","28000","31000"," We're going to demystify the stock market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","31000","38000"," We're going to take your fair away from market crashes or anything that you hear out there"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","38000","42000"," about the dangers of trading and how you lose, lose everything, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","42000","47000"," We're going to go ground, not ground zero, but in recent history, ground zero."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","47000","51000"," We're going to talk about events like this."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","51000","54000"," We're going to talk about how to protect yourself."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","54000","59000"," We're going to talk about how to capitalize on these, on these events."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","59000","63000"," Okay. So if you've been trading forever, you don't, you didn't lose anything changed"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","63000","66000"," from making bank all week, just move on down the line."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","66000","72000"," This is mostly, or move on down to the end of this video."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","72000","78000"," For any of you that have lost your shirts today, especially new traders or traders that are always losing"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","78000","83000"," or not making consistent profit, this video, the beginning of it is for you."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","83000","86000"," Okay. So let's get started."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","86000","89000"," We're going to go way back, not way back."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","89000","95000"," We're not going to go back to the 1920s and 30s, but we are going to look at in 2000."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","95000","102000"," I have been seeing comments on Twitter recently talking about how the markets were more difficult"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","102000","107000"," in the past and how people don't remember how hard it was to trade in the past."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","107000","110000"," And I've been trading for a long time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","110000","114000"," And I have never found these markets difficult."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","114000","118000"," Whatever is presented in front of you, it can be traded."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","118000","122000"," So when I hear those things, it kind of bothers me."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","122000","127000"," And it's very disrespectful to traders that have traded for a long time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","127000","132000"," Traders have made their money in these markets for hundreds and hundreds of years."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","132000","135000"," Anyways, we'll move on from that little rant."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","135000","139000"," We want to look back to the .com bubble."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","139000","141000"," I think it was in March."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","141000","146000"," It was like March 13th or something, March 15th."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","146000","151000"," The March 13th, 2000 is when we had the .com crash."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","151000","159000"," And it's an important history lesson in how much value was lost."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","159000","166000"," Well, this is the S&P mini, but in the composite, across all indexes in our stock market, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","166000","169000"," And people lost fortunes."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","169000","182000"," But what's often not talked about in the .com crash and many other crashes is how much money is made in those crashes on both sides of the crash."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","182000","189000"," This not only involves the fall of the market, but the spikes as well."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","189000","196000"," So if you look inside of just this chart, if you look closely in this screen right here, you can get a little bit closer."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","196000","210000"," If market participants know that the market is going down, a lot of these, the shorts aren't so much, but the options are very much so priced in so that you don't make max gains."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","210000","220000"," It's not like you're going to either, and it's not like you're going to buy puts up here at the top, dated a year out, and those are going to just print heavy all the way down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","220000","224000"," The market makers devalue options over time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","224000","227000"," There are strategies to mitigate that."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","227000","231000"," If you had bought some spreads dated this far out, those would print heavy."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","231000","241000"," But if you look at spreads that are dated one, two, three, four years out, they might make you five hundred, ten thousand percent."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","241000","246000"," They really don't make you the money that's made within these weeks or days."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","246000","252000"," You know, when you see this crash here and we go down, let's say we start up here and we were at 1550, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","252000","256000"," And then we go all the way down here to this 1287 mark."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","256000","267000"," You know, there's a lot of profit in here, but then when you look down below here, this 1263, when we shot back up to 1409, that was an unexpected move, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","267000","271000"," If you didn't know that that was if we were going to have a spike in the market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","271000","277000"," So there was a lot of money to made even on the way down as a bull in this market over time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","278000","286000"," And even looking at a long time frame on a chart, you could see where this bottom was going to bottom, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","286000","291000"," You could pull this chart out way back in 2000 and know where you'd find bottom."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","291000","298000"," But my point is that even within a market falling, there is a lot of money to be made as a bull."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","298000","303000"," And there's a lot of money switching over to a bear to being a bear, okay?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","303000","315000"," So when you have a day like today that was down, if you watch any of my previous videos, we stopped being long in this market when I started making these videos."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","315000","318000"," And we'll talk about that further down in this timeline."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","318000","324000"," But my point is that you should remember is a few things."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","324000","331000"," One, when a market goes down, sometimes there's more money to be made in the way back up than there is in the way down,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","331000","334000"," especially after it's known that the market is going down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","334000","340000"," Once it's known that we're heading down, there isn't as much value as you start to head down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","340000","347000"," Now, when you come back up, there's a lot of money to be made on this downward pattern, okay?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","347000","349000"," And we're going to talk about that."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","349000","353000"," And we're also going to talk about where we should be buying in a market, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","353000","356000"," We always say don't be buying or we're heading towards the top."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","356000","359000"," You always want to be buying down here, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","359000","361000"," This is where safety is."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","361000","366000"," So when you see a day like today where we're down, and I'll show you that right now, we'll go over there,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","366000","369000"," when you can see on this one-year chart, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","369000","376000"," You know, I got long here, got long here, got long here, and here, and here, and here, and here, and here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","376000","383000"," And I made money each time we went down here with little to no worries, okay?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","383000","388000"," When we're down here, and I go long for a period of time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","388000","396000"," Let's say I start buying positions that are one month out, one week out, two months, three months out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","396000","401000"," If I can put more risk on, I don't have to worry about it as much."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","401000","404000"," And they almost always print, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","404000","406000"," They almost always print."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","406000","412000"," So if you had just been patient this year, or let's go all the way back to November of last year,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","412000","414000"," so we're in August right now, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","414000","416000"," We're going to take the auto off here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","416000","419000"," We're going to look at where we are right now last year."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","419000","421000"," So this is September right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","421000","423000"," Here's September, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","423000","425000"," And here's August."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","425000","432000"," And let's say we dip down here in September 25th, we could have bought this dip and had no worries,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","432000","435000"," even if the market was heading down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","435000","437000"," Same thing goes for November."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","437000","438000"," This is October, I think."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","438000","440000"," You didn't have to worry about it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","440000","447000"," And this time here in November and December, this is what's considered like a holiday run, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","447000","450000"," This is where the market gives back to everybody."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","450000","455000"," You can pretty much, not always, but you know, seven out of nine, eight out of ten years."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","455000","457000"," You're going to get this holiday run."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","457000","458000"," This is fruitful."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","458000","462000"," You can pretty much buy down here in November and hold all the way up to them."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","462000","464000"," I think this is the first or something."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","464000","466000"," Right before New Year's, you get rid of everything."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","466000","468000"," You take your gains and you walk away."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","468000","473000"," I even think only retail's involved in this last month of November."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","473000","475000"," Maybe it's December."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","475000","478000"," But anyways, market sells off in January."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","478000","480000"," You can buy this bottom again."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","480000","485000"," If you had just bought these bottoms, this year, you would not have to work."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","485000","487000"," This is one whole year."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","487000","489000"," You don't have to work."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","489000","490000"," You don't have to play."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","490000","491000"," You don't have to day trade."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","491000","493000"," You don't have to buy month, please."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","493000","495000"," You don't have to follow underneath FOMO."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","495000","498000"," You can just buy these things down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","498000","502000"," Print your check and go do anything that you want to do."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","502000","508000"," And so people like me are always looking for these moments where the market falls off."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","508000","511000"," And we stopped getting long somewhere up in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","511000","515000"," So I want to say it was, yeah, somewhere in July, early August, I stopped."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","515000","517000"," I got long once more."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","517000","519000"," But even then I was selling them."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","519000","521000"," You can go on my Twitter."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","521000","526600"," And I'm selling out of these positions, even going long, like a week, two weeks in, taking"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","526600","528000"," my money and running."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","528000","533320"," And then I've been day trading with a lot of other people on Twitter where we can't hold"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","533320","536000"," anything for any length of time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","536000","538800"," There's always danger, always."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","538800","544000"," And even this morning, I made a post on Twitter that said that I had closed all my longs."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","544000","546000"," And I had been making some serious cash."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","546000","549000"," I made some serious cash on the spy."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","549000","555000"," I made some serious cash shorting, IWM, NDX."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","555000","560000"," And then I made some bank on spy on calls and made some bank on Tesla on calls."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","560000","565000"," When people are always asking me, or telling me, don't enter this position."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","565000","569000"," And then they're telling me, why aren't you staying in this position?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","569000","576000"," So I'm pretty consistently being asked at the wrong time when to be, why am I buying and"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","576000","578000"," why am I selling, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","578000","581000"," So there's a time when everyone is fearful, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","581000","584000"," That I'm the one that's buying, no one else is buying."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","584000","589000"," And then there are times when there's FOMO and people are wondering, they're asking me,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","589000","595000"," today I got asked maybe 20 times, are you going to go long here with Tesla into tomorrow?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","595000","596000"," And I'm not."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","596000","597000"," And I didn't."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","597000","602000"," I went long in Tesla yesterday when they were testing their lower support."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","602000","607000"," And I exit those plays right now because we were at the top of a market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","607000","614000"," You can't stay in those plays longer than the fuel that's in them that run them, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","614000","617000"," They run and you have to get out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","617000","619000"," Now let's say down here, I bought Tesla."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","619000","622000"," This is ES, but let's say I bought Tesla down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","622000","625000"," And I bought a long call that was two, three months out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","625000","633000"," I wouldn't, I would give more leeway to that call losing some value with the anticipating"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","633000","636000"," that we were in a bullish trend going up."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","637000","642000"," And Matt, I wouldn't lose too much money on that down day or down half a day."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","642000","648000"," So my point is this, right now today we started to come down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","648000","656000"," Now we are seasonally going to continue to go down as we head into September and October."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","656000","660000"," Now this does not mean that we won't go up in this timeframe either."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","660000","668000"," And looking at ES where it is right now, we are pretty close here to start taking on some long positions."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","668000","676000"," Now at the end of the day I had someone with like two followers probably a ghost account for some asshole on Twitter."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","676000","681000"," Or someone trying to track me to see if I don't delete any tweets, I don't delete any videos."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","681000","683000"," I don't, no one pays me for what I do."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","683000","684000"," I get paid nothing."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","684000","687000"," So everything that I'm doing here is because of what I do."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","687000","689000"," I am a trader, okay?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","689000","690000"," I trade day in."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","690000","691000"," I trade day out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","691000","693000"," I don't sell fucking courses."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","693000","695000"," I don't fucking sell videos."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","695000","700000"," All my shit that you see in my videos I put together in like five minutes."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","700000","709000"," So if you're wondering what my motivation is, it's mostly that there was a time when I was a horrible trader and I was always losing."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","709000","712000"," I never could seem to time things right."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","712000","715000"," I would see other people that weren't losing money."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","715000","716000"," I didn't want to work any longer."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","716000","721000"," Now I want to buy a boat, a big one, a boat, but I want to buy a big boat and sell around the world."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","721000","727000"," So I went from not having to work a job to now wanting to be able to sell around the world, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","727000","731000"," And I think that a lot of you people have your own dreams and aspirations."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","731000","734000"," You don't want to be working that job that you have."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","734000","739000"," I mean, even like a six figure job, I have no wants to work a six figure job."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","739000","740000"," I've had those jobs."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","740000","743000"," I've had great, great jobs and great places."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","743000","746000"," I've lost all want to do that stuff in life."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","746000","748000"," I do whatever I want now."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","748000","751000"," I get to enjoy my family, my friends."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","751000","753000"," I get to do anything that I want to do."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","753000","764000"," And so when you're looking at today, today is a prime example of when everything is burning, this is the time to do a reset as a bull,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","764000","770000"," or even a market participant, and say to yourself, hey, I want to make money in this market, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","770000","777000"," And you're always going to hear that the market is going to crash, that the market's going to come way down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","777000","780000"," We see over here on the right, they're going to tell you it's never coming back."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","780000","790000"," Even if it isn't ever coming back, there are going to be rips in this never coming back that are going to print insane amounts of money for you."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","790000","795000"," So when you see these dips, these are where the opportunities are."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","795000","802000"," And especially in an index that consistently goes in one direction over a long period of time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","802000","809000"," Now the next thing you need to consider is how you start to enter these long positions here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","809000","813000"," And you want to be sticking to some rules."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","813000","819000"," Now there are other indicators if we're going to continue to go down some finer things to understand."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","819000","823000"," But you also don't want to be missing these bottoms either."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","823000","827000"," We could sell off here and continue to sell off into next year."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","827000","836000"," I really, to be honest with you, could give, I could care less if we continue down from here for the next year, I could care less."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","836000","842000"," Even in March of 2020, some guys bought put spreads, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","842000","845000"," And they just kept printing and printing and printing."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","845000","852000"," And I saw guys that were putting like a thousand bucks in, they might have made 20 grand after two, two, two and a half months."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","852000","855000"," They might have made 20 grand in one of those plays."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","855000","861000"," Whereas I was day opening, I had put spreads and I had some long puts, but I was day trading."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","861000","864000"," I was day trading, the ups and downs of the market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","864000","867000"," And I got out when the effect came out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","867000","873000"," I didn't lose my shirt all in on these puts because they came in and destroyed bears."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","873000","880000"," Not only did they destroy bears, they sent guys that had two, three, four hundred million dollar banks gone."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","880000","884000"," Because they still felt as though it was going to continue to go down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","884000","886000"," They were drinking the Kool-Aid."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","886000","891000"," So you want to be always be trading these markets as they present themselves to you."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","891000","896000"," You always, you only want to be trading with anywhere from 10 to 30%."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","896000","898000"," You never want to be long when you're at a top."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","898000","902000"," Every video I've made has said, de-risk yourself from this market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","902000","906000"," Every single video has said, de-risk yourself."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","906000","909000"," Be ready to buy this dip when it comes."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","909000","912000"," And it came tonight before it's starting to come today."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","912000","915000"," So we'll get deeper into the details here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","915000","917000"," We're going to scroll in and take a look."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","917000","924000"," But these three lines right here I want to show you on the macro is where I start to consider getting long."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","924000","926000"," I'll still look at market conditions."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","926000","928000"," I'll still look at the news."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","928000","930000"," I'll make sure all the bears are on board."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","930000","935000"," And let's just say for shits and giggles for today, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","935000","939000"," Let's say you wanted to enter this right at open tomorrow."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","939000","945000"," And we are at $4,392.75, $4,392.50."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","945000","949000"," Let's say tomorrow morning you wanted to enter a long position here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","949000","952000"," The first thing I want to show you is this."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","952000","957000"," You would have been crazy to enter a long position way up here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","957000","960000"," This is why you don't enter a long way up here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","960000","962000"," You always want to be entering down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","962000","970000"," So if I had asked you way up here at $4,483 or $4,449 or whatever we got to that top up there,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","970000","972000"," hey, should you take on a long right there?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","972000","973000"," Fuck no."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","973000","974000"," Fuck no."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","974000","978000"," And if I ask you down here, hey at $4,392, would you want to take a long here?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","978000","980000"," You start to say, oh, maybe."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","980000","981000"," Maybe."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","981000","984000"," Would you rather take a long down here at $4,331?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","984000","986000"," How about down here at $4,286?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","986000","990000"," And then some bears are going to tell you this week, oh, it's going down too."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","990000","993000"," They're going to tell you it's coming down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","993000","996000"," They're going to tell you it's coming down to $4,217."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","996000","1003000"," You're going to have perm bears telling you it's coming down way down here to $4,128."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1003000","1007000"," I know bears that are saying they ain't getting long until it's at $4,06."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1007000","1010000"," They're still hanging on to $4,06."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1010000","1012000"," Way down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1012000","1015000"," So I don't even think that's $4,03 now."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1015000","1017000"," $4,03.5, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1017000","1021000"," I got bears telling me they ain't getting long until we're down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1021000","1025000"," While they're waiting to get long down here, this market's probably going to continue up."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1025000","1028000"," So the point is this."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1028000","1030000"," We're at this yellow line right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1030000","1039000"," If you were to start to play this white line at $4,393 and you wanted to start to go long"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1039000","1044000"," here, it's not a bad idea to start wanting to get long in this vicinity."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1044000","1047000"," So let's say you did want to buy something here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1047000","1053000"," You would buy something that's either in the money, like a bull call spread that's in the"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1053000","1056000"," money or even slightly more in the money."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1056000","1060000"," You could even buy it way down here in this next line, which is $4,34."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1060000","1063000"," You could just buy it $4,34, $4,36."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1063000","1067000"," Call spread that's dated a month, two months or even three months out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1067000","1070000"," If you're looking at October, I mean you're talking about October 4th."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1070000","1074000"," That's how far out a month and a half is way down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1074000","1078000"," And if you're going to try to tell me that we're going to go down from now until October"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1078000","1082000"," and then come up to the once, you're fucking crazy."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1082000","1084000"," So in this, here's the next point."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1084000","1090000"," If you're buying these, let's say with 10% of your bank, your liquidity, right, you still"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1090000","1094000"," have these next three lines to enter into as well."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1094000","1097000"," So you have time on your hands for this market to come back."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1097000","1102000"," Now, if you put enough time way up here and going long, and let's say it doesn't come"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1102000","1106000"," exactly up to your in the money, but you have time on it and it gets close."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1106000","1108000"," So you can close those at a slight loss."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1108000","1113000"," Let's say it's 10% or 20% of that, 10% you originally put in."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1113000","1115000"," That's the risk that you're taking on."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1115000","1120000"," If you were to then wait for this line and this line and start to increase your risk"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1120000","1126000"," and the amount of money that you're putting in, then going in 20%, 30% to go long here,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1126000","1132000"," you're taking on minimal risk with maximum gains to be going up in this direction."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1132000","1136000"," Now, let's just say we keep, let's bring this down a little bit here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1136000","1138000"," We're going to start looking down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1138000","1140000"," We'll move this one down a little bit right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1140000","1142000"," Let's get rid of this one."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1142000","1144000"," We don't even need this."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1144000","1148000"," The only thing we're looking for are these targets down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1148000","1151000"," These targets, prices will change over time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1151000","1153000"," We go sideways for a little bit here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1153000","1155000"," We come up a little bit and then drop back down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1155000","1157000"," We come up a little bit and drop back down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1157000","1162000"," You could even de-risk yourself more and wait for us to drop down three levels,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1162000","1163000"," but you might miss it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1163000","1166000"," We could jump back up here tomorrow morning."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1166000","1170000"," So I start adding risk on down in here, especially if you're a bull."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1170000","1173000"," If you're a bull, this is the time to start adding on risk."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1173000","1177000"," You add on even more risk down here and more risk down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1177000","1181000"," Let's say down here, now you're all in with your liquidity at that 30%."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1181000","1184000"," You still have 70% money."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1184000","1187000"," You still have cash to go long later on."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1187000","1192000"," You take it on more risk down here and you're so far out in the dates"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1192000","1194000"," that at some point it's going to come back."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1194000","1199000"," You have to remember that stocks go up and stocks go down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1199000","1203000"," Anybody trying to tell you that stocks are going to go down to 406"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1203000","1208000"," with no relief rally is smoking fucking crack."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1209000","1211000"," Smoking fucking crack."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1211000","1213000"," They just don't want you buying."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1213000","1215000"," I don't know if you get that or not."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1215000","1217000"," So if I had asked you up here if you wanted to go long,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1217000","1219000"," I had tons of people telling me to go long here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1219000","1221000"," I had tons of people telling me to go long here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1221000","1223000"," I had tons of people telling me to go long here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1223000","1227000"," Now when you're down here, you want to be starting to go long."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1227000","1230000"," This is where you go long down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1230000","1235000"," So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to chart this out for you"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1235000","1239000"," and you're going to start to look for areas of support"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1239000","1244000"," and areas of resistance for when to start to go long at this point."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1244000","1246000"," Right where we're at right now."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1246000","1247000"," This is kind of perfect."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1247000","1252000"," So what we'll do is we're going to set some support down here"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1252000","1255000"," and we're going to set some resistance on the way way back up."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1255000","1258000"," We're going to chart all this out and you're going to be looking"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1258000","1261000"," for demand at these support lines."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1261000","1264000"," When you start to see demand kick in,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1264000","1266000"," you're going to want to say to yourself,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1266000","1272000"," hey look, I just watched 8 million shares of Spy just be bought"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1272000","1279000"," where I just saw 300,000 or 500,000 or 100,000 over the past like hour"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1279000","1283000"," or so right past day, I haven't seen any big buyers stepping in."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1283000","1286000"," When you start to see these big buyers stepping in,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1286000","1290000"," it is a cue for you to start to add on some long positions."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1290000","1293000"," When you add on these long positions, we're going to do them"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1293000","1298000"," with some de-risking involved in these longs."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1298000","1304000"," So that if they do fail, if they do, let's say we buy along here,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1304000","1307000"," that's three months out, we come tumbling down here and here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1307000","1310000"," At least we've got three months for the stock market to come back"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1310000","1312000"," for those calls to print."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1312000","1313000"," Does that make sense?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1313000","1314000"," I hope they do."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1314000","1317000"," All right, so we already started talking about these lines"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1317000","1319000"," that I put in down below, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1319000","1324000"," Four, zero, three, five, four, one, two, eight."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1324000","1329000"," It's probably slightly higher, probably more up here somewhere."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1329000","1331000"," You could add another one in if you wanted to."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1331000","1335000"," Just in case we break through slightly, you don't want to get lost"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1335000","1336000"," while we're trading."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1336000","1338000"," Put another one in down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1338000","1341000"," We already talked about this one up here, four, two, two, seven."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1341000","1343000"," It's probably slightly higher as well."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1343000","1347000"," It's probably up here around four, two, five, one."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1347000","1350000"," We could add another one down here, so it's like a zone."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1350000","1353000"," Now you're looking for these zones right here to buy a dip."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1353000","1356000"," So you have dip buying down here, dip buying down here,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1356000","1360000"," and you probably have another zone down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1360000","1364000"," Put one more in down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1364000","1367000"," Right there, and that looks pretty good down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1367000","1371000"," So let's just say we broke through our normal support areas."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1371000","1375000"," You know, the support that has lasted for, I don't know,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1375000","1378000"," for a long, long, long time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1378000","1382000"," We'll put some down here just in case we start free falling."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1382000","1387000"," Or if we hit a, if we come into a dip, we buy it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1387000","1390000"," It goes up and it gets rejected and comes back down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1390000","1393000"," We want to know where these buy zones are, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1393000","1396000"," So I've got the auto off over here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1396000","1398000"," Raise this up a little bit here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1398000","1403000"," And we're going to start looking when I'm putting in support,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1403000","1406000"," support zones or lines or I'm looking for resistance."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1406000","1411000"," I start to think about where the big boys bought in, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1411000","1416000"," I start to also think about where we sold off and people became trapped."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1416000","1421000"," Mostly with spy, you don't have to worry about where people get trapped"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1421000","1426000"," unless it's more, unless it's recent on a much smaller timeframe."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1426000","1429000"," But we're going to put some more lines in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1429000","1432000"," So we know we had buyers trapped up here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1432000","1435000"," So we're going to put some resistance lines in above."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1435000","1440000"," We can, we can make these tighter when we get down to the weekly and the daily."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1440000","1445000"," We'll put another one right here so we kind of know where it is, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1445000","1450000"," It is kind of funny that this line, this yellow line right here,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1450000","1452000"," we, we tagged it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1452000","1454000"," This has been in all my previous videos."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1454000","1459000"," We tagged it to a pin, to a pin at close today."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1459000","1463000"," And so you want to consider that, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1463000","1467000"," Why did we, why did we tag this yellow line right here?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1467000","1472000"," That's because you've got everybody else out there that knows where these lines are."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1472000","1475000"," They know where the demand lines are."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1475000","1478000"," They know where resistance is."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1478000","1482000"," They know where there are buyers demand, but they know buyers demand is in here"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1482000","1484000"," and we are going into the overnight."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1484000","1486000"," We could talk about that at a time."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1486000","1490000"," But, so you want to know about this area right here, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1490000","1497000"," We've got some small resistance here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1497000","1502000"," And why do we have resistance here is because we've got trapped buyers in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1502000","1507000"," We've got trapped buyers up in here that we're looking for a bigger payday than above."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1507000","1511000"," We've got some buyers still stuck down in here, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1511000","1513000"," They don't want to see us break any lower."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1513000","1517000"," You have to be concerned right here at this point because some of these guys,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1517000","1521000"," or some of these people, I shouldn't say guys, you know,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1521000","1525000"," any of these banks, institutions, retail investors,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1525000","1527000"," they're getting scared right here, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1527000","1531000"," So they might want to sell out of their position if they're break even right now."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1531000","1534000"," They might say, you know what, I'm just going to pull the rip cord and get out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1534000","1539000"," So if you have all this volume dropping off and you have OpEx coming up on Friday,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1539000","1543000"," that is a recipe for us to fall deeper in the market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1543000","1545000"," So here's the 20th right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1545000","1549000"," We have OpEx and your longs that aren't going to get out of, let's call that."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1549000","1551000"," We're at 1600."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1551000","1555000"," Let's move that over."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1555000","1557000"," Move this over to 1600."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1557000","1562000"," That's 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time stock market time, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1562000","1567000"," And we have to consider that any of these calls that are ending,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1567000","1569000"," you know, and this is part of the plan, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1569000","1571000"," Someone's going to short the market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1571000","1575000"," They're going to try to attempt to get all these longs to get out, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1575000","1580000"," And then we have all these buyers that now are selling out of their positions."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1580000","1585000"," And where does that leave us? It leaves us with this big move up right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1585000","1589000"," And if there's nobody else to push this up, there's a fair chance that"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1589000","1592000"," there's a threat to these longs right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1592000","1602000"," So that means we could come all the way back down to this 4.22, 4.22, or 42.51 level by Friday."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1602000","1608000"," Now, the key is to think about is, even if we continue to come down here,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1608000","1615000"," you know, buying, going shorter, buying puts here at this point isn't going to be as profitable."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1615000","1623000"," And so the greed of large banks, large hedge funds is going to kick in at some point"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1623000","1627000"," and want to spike the market back up to make a quick profit."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1627000","1632000"," So that'll probably take place anywhere from now until the 20th."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1632000","1638000"," Now, if you see the market burning from now until Friday, let's say it's all doom and gloom,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1638000","1643000"," let's say we go way down here at 355 in the afternoon on Friday,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1643000","1648000"," you can bet your ass that I'm going to load the boat down there, 100%."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1648000","1653000"," The worse it gets, the uglier it gets, the more I'm going to go all in on this, okay?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1653000","1658000"," So start to think about where the sellers are, where the trap buyers are,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1658000","1663000"," start to think about where they're not anymore, and you can tell right up here"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1663000","1666000"," that none of these buyers are still in."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1666000","1671000"," When we went down here and came back up, they dumped these positions."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1671000","1674000"," This is all new buyers coming up in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1674000","1681000"," So the probably 70% chance we don't dip any farther than the deepest we go is 4-2-2-4."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1681000","1686000"," And I would expect that to happen no later than Friday the 20th."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1686000","1688000"," It's possible it could continue on."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1688000","1698000"," There is another possibility, this would be situation B where we get into this area down here on Friday"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1698000","1704000"," and the net shorts the market, and we continue down to this 4-0-3-5."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1704000","1707000"," I do doubt that happens on Friday."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1707000","1714000"," The chance of that happening is probably about anywhere from 10-20% to max,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1714000","1719000"," especially without a relief rally in this area here, okay?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1719000","1721000"," So we've got some major supports here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1721000","1723000"," We've got some major resistance lines."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1723000","1728000"," I would highly doubt that we come back up and break through these two by Friday."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1728000","1729000"," It's possible."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1729000","1735000"," It's possible some bank out there is going to be pretty pissed off at this attempt and drive it straight up."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1735000","1740000"," But chances are from now until Friday that this market is going to go down,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1740000","1745000"," and then we're going to find a bottom before Friday to go long again."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1745000","1749000"," The thing that you need to think about from this point where you've got all these major lines, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1749000","1753000"," We're going to start to take it down to a smaller timeframe."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1753000","1755000"," Let's click auto."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1755000","1758000"," Bring this over."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1758000","1761000"," We're going to take auto off."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1761000","1769000"," We start to get a better picture of where we need to start looking for even more support and resistance lines."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1769000","1771000"," We can make these minor ones."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1771000","1773000"," These can be some inter-day-day trading lines."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1773000","1775000"," You can change the size of them."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1775000","1778000"," You can make these like these are ones right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1778000","1780000"," We'll make these majors over here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1780000","1783000"," We'll make this a two."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1783000","1784000"," Make these fatter."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1784000","1786000"," We'll make this one fatter over here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1786000","1791000"," We'll make this a two so you can kind of tell a difference between what's a minor support line,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1791000","1794000"," what's a major support line, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1794000","1797000"," If we're playing tomorrow, what are we looking for?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1797000","1800000"," Let's say we don't move tonight at all, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1800000","1804000"," We're looking for a break below 43.73 to get more bearish."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1804000","1809000"," We're looking for a break above for relief rally above 44.12."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1809000","1814000"," This could actually take place in the overnight, but this is pretty much what we're looking for"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1814000","1818000"," to get more bearish and to get more bullish, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1818000","1821000"," Now, as we come down tomorrow, let's say we were bearish tomorrow."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1821000","1826000"," We'll stroke the bears because they did a good job today."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1826000","1828000"," Let's say we come down tomorrow."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1828000","1832000"," You are going to find some support down here at 43.73, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1832000","1837000"," We already know that you're going to find more support down here at 43.43."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1837000","1838000"," Let's find out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1838000","1843000"," Let's scale out a little bit and find out where the halfway mark is."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1843000","1844000"," Go back to auto."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1844000","1851000"," Let's find out where the halfway mark is down here and see if we can find another level of support."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1851000","1859000"," It's probably somewhere in here and somewhere somewhere right there."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1860000","1865000"," You're going to look for these levels of support as you break through."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1865000","1870000"," You're going to look for demand as we break through over time as well."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1870000","1874000"," I'll put these in on my planning chart, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1874000","1880000"," I'll transfer these to my day trading chart so that I know when to pay attention to spy."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1880000","1888000"," I'm also going to use"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1888000","1893000"," this chart in conjunction with other charts."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1893000","1896000"," I'm going to keep an eye on IWM."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1896000","1899000"," I'm going to keep an eye on NQ."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1899000","1901000"," I'm going to keep an eye on T and X."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1901000","1905000"," I'm also going to keep an eye on the VIX or UVXY."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1905000","1908000"," I'm also going to keep an eye on the dollar."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1908000","1911000"," Let's say I want to go long at any point in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1911000","1917000"," When I start to take some risk on, I'm going to be checking these other charts to make sure that NQ is not following off a cliff."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1917000","1921000"," I'm going to make sure that IWM is not following off a cliff."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1921000","1929000"," They're showing some signs of being on major support or recovering enough for us to get start to go long."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1929000","1934000"," I'm also going to be looking for some volume kicking into the market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1934000","1943000"," I'm also going to be checking the volume profile to make sure that we're in a nice value area, which we probably won't be when we come back up in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1943000","1948000"," I'm also going to be checking the dollar, making sure that doesn't have a ton of room to move up on."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1948000","1950000"," I'm going to check T and X."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1950000","1956000"," I'm going to check the 10-year and make sure that's kind of an area where it has the chance to not go crazy up or crazy down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1956000","1959000"," If you want to keep that around, I think it's one, two, something."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1959000","1961000"," I can't help to look at that chart."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1961000","1965000"," There's a general area we want to keep T and X at."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1965000","1967000"," I keep these charts up."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1967000","1969000"," I'll usually open them on other monitors."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1969000","1970000"," I'll open them."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1970000","1972000"," I have monitors in my desk area here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1972000","1977000"," I think I've taken pictures of it or video of it in the past, but I'll watch Spy NQ."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1977000","1979000"," I'll watch RTY."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1979000","1983000"," I won't watch Tesla and Apple on Amazon, but I will watch the dollar."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1983000","1987000"," I will watch the 10-year, and I will watch the VIX."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1987000","1991000"," My call for tomorrow is going to be..."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1991000","1998000"," My call for tomorrow is if it breaks below 43.73 or bearish, you break above 44.12."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","1998000","2000000"," We're going to be bullish."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2000000","2005000"," I am going to look if we stay in this sideways area and to open."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2005000","2007000"," I did take some call FDs."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2007000","2009000"," Not a lot, but just enough."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2009000","2014000"," $1,000 on a relief rally right at the open."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2014000","2020000"," It has a chance to sell off a little bit more and have another relief rally into Friday,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2020000","2024000"," but I don't mind expending a little bit of money as we head down here so I don't miss anything,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2024000","2029000"," especially if it shoots up even for just a few points at the open to sell off even deeper."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2029000","2036000"," If we get this little relief rally, it opened at 44.14."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2036000","2041000"," I'm going to sell those FDs and wait to see what happens up here because we can continue to go down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2041000","2048000"," The other thing to remember when we do something like this is there are lots of longs that are trapped"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2048000","2052000"," with a lot more money than you, a lot more money than the shorts in this market"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2052000","2059000"," that are going to want that relief rally to sell their positions down and go short as well,"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2059000","2061000"," to fuel this to go down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2061000","2067000"," You also have bears that are going to take their profit at this point and wait for a relief"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2067000","2070000"," for a snap back up to go short once more."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2070000","2072000"," Always remember that too."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2072000","2076000"," There are certain levels that people are going to feel safe shorting here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2076000","2078000"," We know that people feel safe here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2078000","2081000"," We know that there will be a squeeze above this level."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2081000","2086000"," We also know that if we have any sort of relief down here tomorrow, anywhere."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2086000","2090000"," Let's say we sell off tomorrow morning to right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2090000","2095000"," We know that any spring up, people are going to remove their shorts then go back short again"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2095000","2098000"," and there will be multiple squeezes on the way back up."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2098000","2100000"," So don't fear."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2100000","2108000"," I want you guys to look at moments like this as an opportunity to go long in safety"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2108000","2112000"," and not this scary moment, I guess."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2112000","2118000"," If you are upside down right now, this is the time for you to start to want to get long."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2118000","2123000"," Even if seasonally, we're going to go down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2123000","2130000"," This is where you want to start buying for Rips higher and you'll continue to do this as we go down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2130000","2135000"," If you've never gotten short on a market, we've been talking all week long."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2135000","2140000"," Every week, where it's a short NQ, where it's a short IWM."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2140000","2145000"," I took a short up here on Spy the other day, right into clothes, right at the clothes."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2145000","2155000"," I think I made, I don't know, I think it was like somewhere like 300%, 500%, and 800% on this short position right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2155000","2159000"," So you'll make money on these shorts, but you also want to be playing these longs"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2159000","2163000"," and you want to be able to take both sides as a trader."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2163000","2167000"," But this message is specifically for the bulls."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2167000","2169000"," You're a bull."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2169000","2173000"," This is when you start to look to get long in a market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2173000","2176000"," These are the times, not up here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2176000","2182000"," Don't, when people are telling you to be getting long up in here, or this looks bullish, this does not look bullish."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2182000","2188000"," This looks bullish on a daily or a weekly, this looks bullish to hold for a day or two or half a day."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2188000","2190000"," This looks bullish for a few hours."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2190000","2194000"," You know, but nothing that you're going to hold for a week, even if you get up in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2194000","2196000"," This was all danger zone."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2196000","2198000"," All of this was danger zone."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2198000","2200000"," You know where the danger zone wasn't?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2200000","2202000"," Way down here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2202000","2204000"," All this was like, hey, I'm going to buy it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2204000","2206000"," I'm going to set it and forget it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2206000","2208000"," You know, you guys will see me be like, hey, I'm taking a vacation."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2208000","2211000"," I take those vacations somewhere down in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2211000","2216000"," When I disappear from the internet, it's when I get long, way down in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2217000","2220000"," And I still get asked down here, why are you getting long here?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2220000","2222000"," It's so dangerous down in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2222000","2226000"," And furthermore, I remember buying this dip right here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2226000","2228000"," And it was a long spread that was a month out."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2228000","2230000"," And sure enough, it was in the money."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2230000","2233000"," And sure enough, it still printed even when we went down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2233000","2240000"," And that spread went from like, I think that spread was worth like, I don't fucking know, it was worth like, I forget."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2240000","2242000"," Let's say it was worth like five bucks."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2242000","2245000"," Once it went down here, it was worth like a dollar or something."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2245000","2247000"," It was worth absolutely nothing."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2247000","2253000"," But that spread eventually came back and just started printing and printing and printing until it was 100% in the money."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2253000","2262000"," And once it got back to 100% in the money, see, when I bought this one down here, right when it closed, there was nothing they were going to do when those options closed."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2262000","2268000"," At the end of the day, that was going to drop the market way down here so that my, so that my spreads didn't print."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2268000","2269000"," Okay."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2269000","2271000"," So start thinking about this."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2271000","2274000"," If you're a bull, and I keep saying it, I'm repetitive about this stuff."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2274000","2276000"," Get yourself some charting software."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2276000","2278000"," I was going to break out Webull for you."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2278000","2284000"," I'll have a chart, I'll post a chart on Webull for you with some support and some resistance lines on them."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2284000","2289000"," But you want to be playing in these zones down here during the day."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2289000","2292000"," You want to be ready to buy the dip, the real dip."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2292000","2293000"," There should be a fake dip in here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2293000","2295000"," This is probably a fake dip."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2295000","2296000"," It's probably going to come back to."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2296000","2300000"," If I had to guess, it's going to come back down to 43.39 at the least."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2300000","2307000"," And more than likely, it's going to come down to 42.83 before end of day on Friday."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2307000","2315000"," Another sneaky thing that the market or not the market makers with the banks will do is they'll even wait for this to come down on Monday or Tuesday."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2315000","2322000"," They'll actually go long after expiration on Friday, not buy anything on Friday and wait for Monday."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2322000","2326000"," So we're going to wait and see as the rest of the week goes on."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2326000","2330000"," If you want to go short in this market, remember that all the money was here."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2330000","2335000"," There is no more money here until we come back up to go short even more."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2335000","2337000"," Or you could go short."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2337000","2350000"," But if you're going to buy puts, let's say, you're going to want to be waiting at this point for some sort of move up and you want to see the premium burn off, burn off those puts or those put spreads and then go short again."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2350000","2361000"," One thing you always have to remember when you're shorting this market, any market, or you're going to keep going short in this market is they're only good for as long as the run is going down."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2361000","2363000"," You didn't want to sell out of that position."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2363000","2366000"," Wait for it to come back up and go short again."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2366000","2369000"," Well, at least with options."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2369000","2373000"," I guess that does work the same for going short, shorting a stock."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2373000","2382000"," You can just keep our diamond handing those things, but the danger and risk associated with it for a rip higher is too much for my blood."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2382000","2391000"," So if you're a bear, you would want to exit your position at some point tomorrow down here around 43.40 or even at 43.72."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2391000","2399000"," Look for a push up and then get back short again on puts unless you see some demand come in at any of these levels down below."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2399000","2401000"," Good luck to you all today."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2401000","2406000"," Tomorrow, there's a lot of money right now, but that's, I want to leave you with that."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2406000","2413000"," But there is a ton of money in the next, let's call it the next week or two to be made in this market."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2413000","2416000"," For all this bullshit we had over here, right?"
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2416000","2421000"," There is so much money going on in here right now and you want to capture a part of it."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2421000","2423000"," I'll see you all on Twitter tomorrow."
"Znnmv-LRKj0","2423000","2425000"," Don't forget to like and subscribe."
