"193260","198580"," I saw that some just barely printed while they did okay."
"199680","201140"," Not really good, though. "
"204400","205540"," Yeah, ATVI."
"206280","211580"," And then did you guys all see Roblox this morning?"
"212880","215080"," Looks like Nancy Pelosi got her."
"217020","217680"," Oh, yeah. "
"218000","218600"," Sorry, I was outside."
"219300","220320"," I have my dogs outside."
"223870","225570"," Take that off for you this morning. "
"227230","230730"," Someone was asking if I have my GS looks terrible, right?"
"231350","232430"," Red to green day?"
"233410","234390"," I think so."
"234990","236250"," I'm hoping that it is today."
"236690","237250"," You know, it's weird. "
"237410","240390"," Even the sell-off last night, we didn't still didn't sell-off below."
"241330","243210"," Long time support, right?"
"245090","246550"," Yeah, good morning, Faison."
"247330","247970"," Rest in peace. "
"248210","248910"," You know, it's interesting."
"249850","252590"," This is one of those days where we have a chance."
"253890","254890"," It's not guaranteed. "
"256050","258709"," But I have had days like today where."
"260350","262270"," Your calls might come back."
"263190","264250"," Now, that's not guaranteed. "
"264790","266630"," I can't guarantee that to you."
"266770","270870"," So if you hear me saying this, you know, it's everybody has to make their own decisions out there."
"270910","272190"," You're all responsible for your own stuff. "
"272690","279250"," But this might be one of the situations where you can roll a position."
"280210","281950"," Depends on where we go right off the bell, right?"
"283490","284630"," Yeah, good morning to Chaz."
"284770","285390"," Good morning, Mary. "
"285650","286270"," Good morning, Gerald."
"286550","288170"," Good morning, uh, Winkyface."
"290480","299500"," No, there's a, uh, there's this idea that on a day like today, it was a few things. "
"299840","301340"," First of all, if you're bearish, congratulations."
"302300","302760"," I don't know."
"302840","306720"," It should have printed well if you were a bear and you were in put options at least. "
"307340","309840"," It printed great if you were a futures trader, hands down."
"311520","316240"," As a, you know, three days of theta on either end of that stick is kind of brutal unless you're"
"316240","317020"," in put spreads."
"318140","323720"," You probably made some money, a lot of money if you were in just straight puts, but still either"
"323720","325480"," way, congratulations if you're a bear. "
"326140","331780"," You know, the one thing I thought to myself this morning is I know that I am a bull because"
"331780","336460"," even when I'm in put positions and they print, I still don't feel right inside."
"336460","341600"," I always feel like, uh, I'm like hurting the market or hurting."
"343240","346900"," Something by seeing stocks go down unless they're fitting fraud like Nicola. "
"349760","351240"," So good morning to all of you out there."
"351280","351920"," Good to see everybody."
"355160","357760"," The earnings were mixed bag for sure. "
"358000","359540"," I went through them briefly this morning."
"360480","362260"," But they were without a data mixed bag."
"362600","365740"," And then the the economic news for today wasn't that good either. "
"366680","368080"," And it wasn't good."
"368240","369820"," I think we had housing starts this morning."
"370020","371040"," I just looked at it briefly. "
"374460","375140"," The house."
"375360","377880"," It looked like some of the housing numbers were not good as well."
"380860","390780"," So the Empire State Manufacturing Index, the actual point seven leading forecast was 25.5"
"390780","396120"," previous was 31.9. We've got building permits and housing starts tomorrow. "
"400640","401800"," Yeah, I don't feel right."
"401960","403900"," I make money, which is why I always felt too early."
"405020","405860"," It's the Boston guilt. "
"406080","406960"," It is the Boston guilt."
"407500","408680"," I grew up with that Boston guilt."
"411040","412900"," So there's not too much going on right here this morning. "
"413100","415200"," I do want to talk about a few things before you get started."
"417480","418460"," So I've got some."
"419000","419820"," We got some ticker. "
"419920","420240"," It's funny."
"420480","421480"," Like Nancy Pelosi, right?"
"421560","422100"," We got Roblox."
"422240","426140"," They have Walmart news yesterday saying that Walmart was getting into the metaverse. "
"426440","428760"," And then this morning you see Roblox up five bucks."
"428980","430920"," They might know why Roblox is up five bucks this morning."
"431840","432460"," Good morning, Troy. "
"439440","440160"," Thoughts on D."
"442000","444280"," Kind of a quick question for this early in the morning."
"444540","445580"," Yeah, video games are hot."
"445840","446280"," Yeah, I know. "
"451360","452180"," We do have."
"452680","454000"," I want to give you guys some quick updates."
"454660","457120"," The website is starting to come together. "
"457380","459140"," There's tons more work to do on it."
"459500","462200"," And it's mostly just the fact that Joe and I can't get to."
"462380","463240"," I haven't gotten together yet. "
"463960","466000"," The discord still has a ton of work on it."
"466000","470360"," I've got some some trading bots in there and I have to put the put the commands up for you"
"470360","471380"," guys to have a look at."
"471680","474200"," I took my blue through it last night late night. "
"474300","475580"," You guys are all out of there at that point."
"476120","478300"," But it was really cool to see guys in there."
"478520","479720"," It really made my day. "
"482740","486360"," And so I've got a net stuff on the economic front."
"486480","490120"," You guys already saw the numbers come out for the empire manufacturing index."
"491300","494000"," The home builders index were getting at 10 a.m. this morning. "
"494000","495780"," I would assume it's going to add some."
"496520","497860"," Some form of."
"501220","502600"," Maybe more volatility. "
"503200","507320"," Or at least you can hear the bears talk about that being a volatility question."
"507960","512780"," I did notice this morning that some of the military defense stocks were up."
"513159","515500"," I posted yesterday on Twitter about. "
"518080","522380"," The United Kingdom setting troops in light armor to the to Ukraine."
"522380","524460"," That's a pretty significant move."
"525760","527760"," Seeing a great Britain there. "
"528140","532400"," You know that Russia has poisoned people in Great Britain in the UK."
"533900","536040"," In the past it's it's a show of force."
"536040","537680"," You know you can't look at it any other way. "
"539160","541420"," And see the military stocks up today."
"542280","543880"," There's a no brainer as well."
"544940","545840"," Now this morning. "
"547100","548960"," We did see hedging on Friday."
"549140","549900"," We saw hedging on."
"552600","553100"," I don't mind one day. "
"553100","554980"," King, he's not good for the market."
"559320","805290"," Uh, I need"
"805290","805570"," to get a."
"805810","810430"," Because I didn't know that I was going to mute this thing."
"810530","813930"," And I didn't unmute every time I hit this button it mutes and that doesn't unmute. "
"816390","818110"," Uh, I need to repeat."

"875650","882070"," up to 475 take another hedge so maybe it is just celebrate rip at this point we have traded down"
"882070","889210"," in previous cycle and previous earning seasons so it's not like we can't we can't trade down in"
"889210","895450"," this current earning season everyone it seems like everybody knows that we're going to trade down"
"895450","900530"," eventually as earning season wraps itself up we know that companies that even have a good earning"
"900530","908030"," season might use this to dump bad information out there sometimes when you know this is going to be"
"908030","912370"," the last good earning season it's a good time they are dirty laundry especially if you get good"
"912370","923690"," numbers need a bad phone you guys hear this okay so if"
"923690","933910"," you read the description down below it shows with a link to the discord and the website get"

"942930","950410"," last hurrah we know that we're gonna trade down eventually we might just start this gig early with"
"950410","956010"," that being said I would still expect this let's say we trade down this entire week I want to still"
"956010","962670"," expect us to trade up on Thursday now we'll trade this market what to the right all day long every"
"962670","966950"," day if we trade up today we'll trade up today and I'll take it up as well so we could"
"966950","972290"," have spock Emma noted that we could have volatility that moves in both directions we could trade"
"972290","978890"," high and low the entire rest of the week but when you think about it we have mixed bank earnings"
"978890","983590"," that are coming out now right we're starting to get more bank earnings and the rest of this week is"
"983590","991570"," all bank earnings they're not as good as anticipated you know that you have companies that are"
"991570","997090"," already pumped up that even if their earnings are great they're they're not expected to have great"
"997090","1006130"," earnings the next earnings cycle so it becomes a solid news type of an event season and further you"
"1006130","1013070"," know that we need to trade back down to the 200 let's say between now in March so everyone starts"
"1013070","1018510"," to take a neutral or bearish stance at this point and I'm waiting to put it on me last week"
"1018510","1023109"," I'm waiting to put a hedge on I was way I hope that we gapped up today so he gets"
"1023109","1029829"," that 475 480 somewhere in there to throw another hedge on and it didn't wait for me right we traded"
"1029829","1037829"," down into today now we don't trade down in a straight line typically so we should trade back a"
"1037829","1043550"," higher again at some point and hopefully I can grab one of these these next spots to grab a hedge"
"1043550","1050170"," now I do still think we're either going to trade up today or this week on Thursday at some point"
"1050170","1058850"," we should trade up quite high and I am going to populate that list of tickers that I talked about"
"1058850","1064490"," yesterday in the live stream the stickers that I charted some of them did not trade down heavily"
"1064490","1071170"," overnight this morning and so I have some questions about that I want to know why some of these"
"1071170","1079070"," stickers did not participate in the sell down over the weekend and also noticing that you know like"
"1079070","1086510"," you see Roblox traded up on the metaverse play on the Nancy Pelosi play so they don't mind pumping"
"1086510","1091530"," a stock when they can and also oils up this morning so that's been a great trade so looking at"
"1091530","1096730"," I was looking at oil this morning XLE it's all up pre-market so look for some more gainers this"
"1096730","1101010"," morning and specifically I'm going to be tracking I'm going to be going to get quiet here at the"
"1101010","1107890"," bell at some point and look to and check these tickers out against how they did overnight and we're"
"1107890","1112470"," going to pay attention to them as the week drags on I want to see if we can trade some"
"1112470","1117210"," of these up that you know it's funny someone yesterday mentioned wish and that wasn't on our list"
"1117210","1122750"," yesterday but it only traded down another 20 cents or something which was a previous low from a"
"1122750","1128010"," couple days ago you know wish should have kind of burnt the ground over this weekend and it didn't"
"1128010","1133470"," so I'm gonna keep my on these on these trades I want to I want to trade these if we"
"1133470","1140110"," can get some squeeze plays last last year around this time I made a lot of money trading these"
"1140110","1145430"," stocks that started squeezing and so I think there's a chance this week at some point we'll catch a"
"1145430","1157400"," couple of those tickers as the week grinds on and even into next week into February 1st and"
"1157400","1163020"," yes am I still going calls deep more than likely yes my my Michael calls deep off the bell this"
"1163020","1169260"," morning and if I don't do it right at 9 30 I'm probably gonna do it at 10 depending upon"
"1169260","1174620"," the next set of numbers that we have coming out but without a doubt without a doubt I'll go long"
"1174620","1180320"," today at some point I think I don't think that we trade down the entire rest of the day and"
"1180320","1187100"," I don't think that we trade down later than maybe 10 a.m. it's possible anything's possible but yes"
"1187100","1193560"," I will go balls deep long at some point this morning maybe even off the bell if you're if you"
"1193560","1201600"," are wondering good morning Jill yeah so we'll we'll be watching the support levels right off the"
"1201600","1209920"," bell here as soon as 9 30 hits you're gonna see resistance it's 9 23 right now and you are"
"1209920","1215420"," going to see resistance off the bell at 460 no matter what and that is why we are opening right"
"1215420","1223400"," now right at that 460 level is because there is heavy heavy support at 460 now the next step down"
"1223400","1230960"," with well as a Friday was 455 and then 450 it was 448 we'll firm it up once the once"
"1230960","1240260"," again the cash market here and it'll be easy for you take a look and see do I think you"
"1240260","1246720"," know that's a good question Chase I we have no this I want to reinforce to all of you out"
"1246720","1255400"," there we have not traded down below the channel line since March 2020 and we knocked on the door of"
"1255400","1262140"," that channel line three times in this past week and yet we still have not traded down that channel"
"1262140","1268780"," line I think I look at it right now we broke through it on ES it looks like last night"
"1268780","1275080"," I looked at it briefly it looks like we broke through it on ES but not spy and you have"
"1275080","1283460"," to also note that the last three times that we've broken through it's always been a higher low very"
"1283460","1290240"," critical information I know that some people out there are noting that or I think that some people"
"1290240","1299220"," are noting that this morning that spy has yet to break its channel from 2020 so I made a note"
"1299220","1304260"," to myself over the weekend and said hey why didn't we break through in Friday well today is Tuesday"
"1304260","1310860"," why didn't we break through it again this morning you know we should have broken through even made"
"1310860","1316680"," up made a lower low and we haven't so not in cash market at least so if we sell up"
"1316680","1322120"," below this today if we were to sell below and maintain below that that support level since March"
"1322120","1331420"," 2020 we got a major problem but until that happens we're still in channel still in trend maybe"
"1331420","1335660"," people think they were trading below that I remember I saw there was one guy out there last week"
"1335660","1341980"," that said we're gonna hit 450 last week and we didn't hit 450 last week today's Tuesday we haven't"
"1341980","1348000"," hit 450 do I think 450 is on the table this week it's possible but do I it hasn't happened"
"1348000","1356360"," yet no so unless unless unless we go there then you can't be bearish you just can't you're not in"
"1356360","1363760"," that context and even then you're not in a bearish context until you trade below I take a look at"
"1363760","1376340"," my chart here but it's still is only a volatility zone we're still not in bear town yet yeah it's"
"1376340","1382760"," still not bear town yet I mean shoot it's funny because I'm a bull but even I know that you"
"1382760","1389660"," know bear towns below like it's it's I have to look up on the chart here in a minute but"
"1389660","1395400"," it's somewhere around four I think it's around 455 457 and then we get into a super bear town once"
"1395400","1402800"," we're below 450 you guys want to get bearish like bear country is like it's it's like 648 I think"
"1402800","1411120"," I think that's true bear country when you're switching to like quote unquote negative gamma when"
"1411120","1417420"," things are ugly when you sell every single rep you will sell it down to the 200 and probably deeper"

"4174000","4179380"," if you are gonna long wish it is a retail favor right now it's being talked about all over social"

"4214030","4220330"," options on wish right now are like a penny they're like two cents each you could buy wish calls"
"4220330","4227250"," from the reason I'm saying this is because they've got two events the CEO steps down on February"
"4227250","4234550"," 1st which would imply that they should have an announcement for a CEO from now into February 1st"
"4234550","4239990"," then they have an ER date coming up I think it's the 18th of February I'm not positive on that"
"4239990","4246970"," one they have an ER date coming up as well so anywhere from now into end of February if you"
"4246970","4254690"," were to just buy the most recent calls that cost a penny right there a buck a contract you could"

"11440540","11445360"," they typically look like you'll see some short covering and stuff but typically when you're trading"
"11445360","11455480"," a turn um you're looking for a large hammer candle you're looking for capitulation from bulls and"
"11455480","11459440"," then you'll see a reversal immediately right you'll see a big red bar and then you're going to see"
"11459440","11464360"," this big giant green bar it'll bounce two or three times and then start moving that process can"
"11464360","11470080"," take anywhere from when that actually happens can take anywhere from 20 minutes to two to three"

"11489300","11495440"," well and the big question is do these insiders know more than we do right do they do they just"
"11495440","11501200"," take the money and run or are they saying hey we're going to convert our calls into equity and let"
"11501200","11508180"," it ride on ERs these are deep deep in the money calls structures that's just be conscious of that"
"11508180","11513140"," as you continue to trade forward and you we have already seen short covering what twice now right"
"11513140","11518080"," we're about to see more short covering on the spy again so maybe you're just taking profit every"
"11518080","11524540"," time we trade down every rip that you see you put yourself up some moving averages on the daily on"
"11524540","11532540"," the one five or 15 minute chart and sell every rip right for profit until we trade down there"
"11532540","11538060"," should be some capitulation at some point this week whether it's today or if it's on Wednesday or"

"11544640","11551420"," the spy and nothing as as of this point has shown me the usual look to a turn in the"
"11551420","11558800"," spy and if you see a turn the spy you'll blow through the daily chart on the one five or"
"11558800","11566340"," fifteen minute you'll blow through the upper resistances on like a 21 ma the nine ma on the 50 the"
"11566340","11571880"," 100 if you stack them above each other you'll see us blow above them we'll bounce then we'll bounce"
"11571880","11576860"," a second or third time and then you'll see big rips much higher but we're not in that phase right"
"11576860","11585020"," now markets not trading like we are done selling spy let's be conscious of that as we trade forward"
"11587280","11596640"," let's take a look at tesla you guys should be trading tesla alongside the spy as well it is"
"11596640","11605660"," correlating with the spy currently unlike you know previous months and past time periods but"

"11639990","11646890"," red huge volume is usually the basing action of the turn emerson knows exactly what i'm talking"

"14582400","14591260"," right you can see it down below here as well and the one thing we're going to watch for here"
"14591260","14601120"," is when we strike down below at 455 470 206 if we strike here you want to"
"14601120","14610440"," the one trick that'll happen is if we start to trade below 455 if we start trading below 470 on"
"14610440","14616040"," the cues or if we start to trade below 206 you're going to be looking for a wall of hedge"
"14616040","14625000"," flow put put flow if that triggers it is easy for us to trade down to 450 within 20 minutes"
"14625000","14633780"," half an hour but that's how violent it'll be so right now we'll pay attention and we'll see if we"

"14704460","14711500"," bulls will tell you it's close enough right see this rejection here right at 371 but you can see"
"14711500","14718620"," that support is light you can see that the real money is down below 370 sometimes you should be"
"14718620","14725780"," aware that you'll see this bar here disappear and they'll move up this orange bar will get thicker"
"14725780","14732940"," or it'll just disappear it'll just be gone right they'll remove the bid into the market or it'll"

"18249420","18259240"," stepping in though right now too what's my take on Amazon what's my take on Amazon it's a"
"18261240","18268840"," so if we go into a risk off typically with Amazon so hedge funds and banks I know this for"
"18268840","18278800"," fact they like to hide an Amazon but they take the long view so if the market sees"
"18278800","18284780"," weakness let's say the mile let's see the market trades down to 400 4000 let's say trades down to"
"18284780","18290820"," 4000 they'll still hide in Amazon but their time frame is longer let's say it's six months or a"
"18290820","18299180"," year at that point and they'll keep adding to their positions if we go into a risk off environment"
"18299180","18306960"," to the market I know for a fact that people hide in Amazon holy shit look at GME ripping and"
"18306960","18315920"," there goes GME this is going to be the 21 gun salute to last year for GME it's already started"
"18317620","18326110"," GME is ripping just the heads up what's my take on"
"18326110","18335900"," Amazon it's tough it's a great ticker to trade I used to trade it a"
"18335900","18345740"," lot I think that if you look back on stocks like Amazon especially"
"18345740","18353540"," big tech you'll see that sideways action for a year and then they make this huge move up where they"
"18353540","18359860"," trade at the next level if you look at like if you look at like Facebook or Apple or anything"
"18360560","18367180"," anything even Nvidia look at any of these big stocks that's not not really Nvidia but they're"
"18367180","18372920"," coming into that phase typically when they do something like this the banks don't change how they"
"18372920","18380480"," trade you'll see one huge capitulation move in Amazon it'll trade down very very low and then it'll"
"18380480","18386320"," swing up and start trading in the next trading zone at like 4000 like the bottom will now be 3800"
"18386320","18394140"," the top will be 4200 but there will be a moment of capitulation right before it does that move go"
"18394140","18401160"," back on stocks like any big tech and look a scrunch scrunch it down like a five-year chart scrunch"
"18401160","18407640"," down so you can see like 10 years and you'll see as they as they move up into new trading"
"18407640","18413800"," zones they trade sideways typically at the end of that sideways trading when they're going to make"
"18413800","18418680"," the next move up there'll be a huge capitulation move down and a swing high a swing low that a"
"18418680","18427500"," swing high it can take anywhere from one month to three months and before when that move happens"
"18427500","18433060"," you'll see retail get shaken out they'll pick it up the banks will pick it back up and then you're"
"18433060","18440440"," at a top buyer again I'll have to show some of those charts sometimes you guys if you guys look"
"18440440","18446260"," if you guys do some research on some tickers over like a 10 or 5 or 10-year period you'll"
"18446260","18452640"," see that these stocks do this often matter of fact I think Amazon you can see it a couple times"
"18452640","18461680"," too you can see it Amazon right here I'm looking at it but there's other tickers that have done it"
"18463700","18470890"," so do I think I'm at a bottom on Amazon no I think it's easy that we trade down a"
"18470890","18480990"," 2800 on Amazon if not deeper easy and"
"18480990","18485850"," I look at Amazon as a something holds up the market I think between now and March without a doubt"
"18485850","18494910"," we now March possibly as late as April you're going to see a huge capitulation in the market at"
"18494910","18503410"," some point it's a foregone conclusion and if you don't see that any kind of capitulation it's"
"18503410","18508990"," normal for us to capitulate every spring and if that doesn't happen then it happens in the summer"
"18509850","18514550"," we have a big a big move down so I think you have to consider that into this year and"
"18514550","18527070"," next year yeah"
"18527070","18532770"," it's fifty-eight cents fifty-six cents so when as low as fifty-six cents now move on the spy"
"18542590","18546930"," and one more note here as you see where we are right here there should be this last little move"
"18546930","18556780"," up excuse me you'll see one more retest down below possibly to"
"18556780","18561980"," four fifty six fifty and then a nice rip into close if we have a buy a buy side imbalance"
"18565480","18572760"," and you'll pay attention to the to the uh cvd buyers down here versus sellers right now we have"
"18572760","18579160"," looks like a buy program is on right now actually it's two o'clock sometimes they start them early"
"18581020","18584580"," so you can get out of your calls right here and then what you do is you take pick them"
"18584580","18594310"," up again somewhere down below it like four fifty "
"18594310","18603440","-six seventy-four maybe let me grab one more time heading up unless we saw off into the close do"
"18603440","18613060"," I think we're selling off into the close I don't know we've got more bank ERs tomorrow so that's a"
"18613060","18625790"," problem so maybe we trade up into the closing bell and then we trade down into tomorrow uh"
"18625790","18636450"," Nat is saying that spy is going to sell into the close I"
"18636450","18642350"," was earnings factor into that with Amazon you know Kareem if you want I can do a video specifically"
"18642350","18652590"," on Amazon I used to trade it uh the thing about thing about as a factor in Amazon well if"
"18652590","18659910"," you're Amazon you know this is the last good earnings season uh you know that you can dump your"
"18659910","18666370"," dirty laundry now I expect some of these companies to dump dirty laundry we've done in the past and"
"18666370","18675370"," seasons like this you end up dumping and then let's just say earnings are kickass and Amazon rips"
"18675370","18680410"," just some all-time new high that's still going to be a take profit right if you're like if you're"
"18680410","18686410"," a big money guy and you're you're long in Amazon and it trades up every ticker that's even"
"18686410","18693830"," reporting good earnings right now the guidances are sucking and there's also this this idea of"
"18693830","18697250"," taking profit matter of fact let me ask some of you guys I know some of you guys are Tesables"
"18698390","18704150"," I know right now that deep in your heart if you're long Tesla in stock if Tesla has a kickass"
"18704150","18711550"," earnings and Tesla trades up to 1200 or 1300 bucks I know that some of you are going to want"
"18711550","18717670"," to take profit and wait to see what happens in the market the spring or summer so it's not it's"
"18717670","18727250"," not abnormal to think that will happen with Amazon or with Tesla or with Apple is that even if we"
"18727250","18731770"," trade up in the ER we profit take does that profit take and take place in the overnight when you're"
"18731770","18737710"," not looking it happened with the city group right they had a kickass earnings kickass guidance"
"18737710","18744590"," everything was great and they still sold off by morning so you're either going to get companies"
"18744590","18750270"," dumping shit news or you're going to get companies reporting kickass earnings then say we have a"
"18750270","18759320"," rough outlook for the next three months or six months you know we can't give forward guidance so"
"18759320","18763740"," it's very cautious right now the other thing too about Amazon right now is you know look at the"
"18763740","18771480"," context of the market we all knew the market was going up for 2020 and most of 2021 we knew"
"18771480","18778340"," we knew the market was going up so whenever Amazon would trade to a low you knew that you could"
"18778340","18786040"," take along in some kind of safety so everybody was trading Amazon right you buy the dip you know"
"18786040","18791200"," the defined sideways trading range of Amazon you know you're relatively safe taking that long are"
"18791200","18799960"," you relatively safe taking along at this moment in time probably not so how"

"18856380","18864700"," indicator and i'm not i don't i'm not thinking that we don't trade up into the close today i think"
