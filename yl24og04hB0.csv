"yl24og04hB0","570780","576940"," Hold that's not bearish. It's very bullish. So my my take right now into Friday or at least next week"

"yl24og04hB0","654700","660460"," Just to highlight this thing right here is not of bellow this white thing right here is not bellow"
"yl24og04hB0","661460","666780"," Whenever this thing comes down meta tends to move to the upside whenever it's in congruence"
"yl24og04hB0","667540","672860"," It's bullish right we got another one right here. It's starting to build up right here for a move to the upside on meta"
"yl24og04hB0","673580","677100"," Now no, no, I'm a spy. Sorry wrong one wrong fucking one"
"yl24og04hB0","677580","679580"," Well, I want to show you meta here"

"yl24og04hB0","696620","703340"," I want Nita the house girl and have like armed guards out in front and I can probably take jets all over the world"
"yl24og04hB0","704580","706580"," With the quality of power here"
"yl24og04hB0","708380","710380"," So meta"
"yl24og04hB0","710380","715940"," You got this big giant thing going on down here right big giant thing going on down here"
"yl24og04hB0","716180","720920"," Just pulsing to rip higher on this clothes here, okay"
"yl24og04hB0","721380","727620"," Price target after the bell for meta if you get a bullish report is going to be a"
"yl24og04hB0","728340","732140"," Target of 3 12 88 if you do a measured"
"yl24og04hB0","733340","735180"," Hold on a second here"
"yl24og04hB0","735180","739580"," If you do a measured move on meta, I don't know I haven't measured it yet"
"yl24og04hB0","740140","742140"," Turn this in the fly"
"yl24og04hB0","742220","744220"," Let's take a look at it back here"
"yl24og04hB0","745940","748620"," You've got another price target above on meta"
"yl24og04hB0","754060","758200"," Right there, do I think you get back to all-time highs? No, I fucking doubt it. I"
"yl24og04hB0","759380","761380"," fucking doubt it"
"yl24og04hB0","761900","766020"," I'll give you this one right here possibly. I'll give you that one possibly"
"yl24og04hB0","767100","769100"," 328"
"yl24og04hB0","770340","772340"," Hold on a second here"
"yl24og04hB0","776060","778060"," So"
"yl24og04hB0","778740","781660"," Right there, that's I'm gonna expect if you get a good report"
"yl24og04hB0","782180","787380"," Unless it's like Winky says, you know, Winky's like your target is probably 313 47"
"yl24og04hB0","788060","795380"," You've got two additional targets on the upside 328 11 and 343 71 the only thing that I will say to you is"
"yl24og04hB0","797140","799140"," That regardless"
"yl24og04hB0","799140","801140"," Regardless"
"yl24og04hB0","801420","806220"," Look at that beautiful fucking thing right there. Look at that. Look at that sexiness right there"
"yl24og04hB0","807780","809780"," Regardless of outcome"
"yl24og04hB0","810580","817140"," You are going to expect profit taking and so if you have a bullish outcome we blast off"
"yl24og04hB0","818860","820860"," Anything like that anything like that"
"yl24og04hB0","821980","824860"," You're gonna expect a pullback. I"
"yl24og04hB0","825860","830100"," Don't like something on meta here, and this is the one thing I want to say to you"
"yl24og04hB0","830100","833100"," This is my one hesitation. I'm meta as I don't like"
"yl24og04hB0","833860","835860"," Velo coming down on the daily"
"yl24og04hB0","836460","841020"," Then you could take this as yeah, we're buying the zero line or whatever, but I don't like it so"
"yl24og04hB0","841900","846560"," I don't like it, man. So if if meta does not does have a bad"
"yl24og04hB0","847540","849540"," earnings your target below is"
"yl24og04hB0","850260","852260"," Like 220 or something like that"
"yl24og04hB0","852260","859540"," So you're downside target right here now 242 I said 220 minute to 242 I"
"yl24og04hB0","860660","864820"," Don't like it like I don't like the setup even if it goes higher"
"yl24og04hB0","864820","870740"," I don't like the so I feel like it's gonna be a solid news kind of an event even if it's positive. So if you're long meta"
"yl24og04hB0","871940","876580"," I'm not looking for any continuation. I'm look for take the money and get out of meta"
"yl24og04hB0","877060","882900"," It's at that place where it's due. It's getting really really long in the tooth here on meta"
"yl24og04hB0","883300","887300"," It's the heads up on that. So targets above you got 313 80"
"yl24og04hB0","888260","892860"," 3.2 11 3.3 71 3.76 11 that's meta"
"yl24og04hB0","896180","899460"," Fuck your puts fuck your calls j pau has you by the balls, baby"
"yl24og04hB0","899460","908020"," That's what I'm saying about Michigan. I'm such a disaster. It's like"
"yl24og04hB0","908820","914420"," It's like all you know, it's all built around two. It's all built around Michigan's like famous for"

"yl24og04hB0","917940","922580"," We're gonna fucking take care of you forever and we're gonna raise the rates and we're not gonna"
"yl24og04hB0","922900","924740"," We're not gonna actually fix the infrastructure"

"yl24og04hB0","2389460","2392900"," Uh, their brand is worth a fuck ton of money"
"yl24og04hB0","2394100","2398820"," Uh, just because of who they are now. This is a longer time frame outlook"
"yl24og04hB0","2400180","2404340"," I don't like uh, they're daily rolling over here"
"yl24og04hB0","2405380","2409620"," And I don't like the peak on their weekly. Okay. I don't like that"
"yl24og04hB0","2409700","2411860"," I don't like it declining here. I just don't like it"

"yl24og04hB0","2458580","2464500"," You could do something where it's like a 16 or 17 dollar and a 10 dollar. They're very much like snap. Okay"
"yl24og04hB0","2466020","2468740"," Uh, and spotify is a good uh, good example of this"
"yl24og04hB0","2468820","2474900"," Does it mean that i'm not bullish on uh, robin hood over time? No, I am. I am bullish on robin hood over time"
"yl24og04hB0","2475540","2480020"," Uh, but I like to see that check back. I want you to know out there that"
"yl24og04hB0","2480740","2485700"," The most bullish trade for robin hood is when it comes back down here at minimum"
"yl24og04hB0","2486500","2491860"," And just checks like 11 dollars, right? You want to see that you always want to see this stuff like hold"
"yl24og04hB0","2492820","2498420"," For continuation to the upside. You never want to have like that initial squeeze that happens. It's great"
"yl24og04hB0","2499300","2502420"," It just it's always it's always more fucking bullish"
"yl24og04hB0","2503060","2506500"," When you get that initial squeeze it comes back down and it holds"

"yl24og04hB0","2615620","2620820"," And uh, I would not I would not panic sell either of these levels. I would just keep holding"
"yl24og04hB0","2621380","2625220"," You know instead of panic selling I would expect it to still come back up again"
"yl24og04hB0","2625780","2631380"," Um, so I'm not I'm not like any I'm not in any kind of like yeah bearish hoods going down to like two dollars"
