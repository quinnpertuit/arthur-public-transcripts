"BDkVo3_KcxI","129800","135440"," Hey, yeah diamond hands. So all right. Let's get started. I wasn't expecting to come on live"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","135440","140080"," I was expecting to make you guys a video when I woke up this morning, but instead of that we'll go live"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","145920","150560"," I want to get you guys a ton of information before 930 this morning. So I'll be quick, okay?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","152920","156600"," I'm just good. Just waking up here chugging coffee try to wake up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","157000","159960"," I ended up going out with some family and friends last night"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","160640","163080"," Okay, so we're gonna start here with"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","163840","170480"," Where we are this morning now in absolute terms before the start of market open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","171760","174680"," There's a few things you need to know I want you to know that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","175760","182240"," Traditionally on the Monday following OPEC's on Friday. We tend to sell off in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","184320","189040"," This is traditionally every year if you go back to last year the year before"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","189680","191680"," 2019 doesn't really matter"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","191680","196920"," We typically sell down heavily in the overnight and then swing much higher"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","197720","199520"," into the daytime"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","199520","205320"," Typically or today versus historically we should swing back up to 465"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","206080","209240"," Although believe it or not the sellers are at 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","209880","215040"," The major sellers are at 470 in this flip. So if you're a bear be aware of that today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","215680","217680"," If you are a bull"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","217800","220400"," Hopefully you bought protection as we've always talked about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","221120","223120"," In case we have moments like this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","223560","227520"," Now on book map this morning, you should be able to see on a larger time frame"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","228400","231880"," We have a supply a steady supply of buyers between"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","232680","236320"," 450 there's a little bit of 450 but the majority at 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","236680","239800"," There are some sellers at the 456 area"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","239800","248880"," Which is kind of wonky because the major sellers are really up here at 470 you can see the the the sellers and the buyers here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","249880","253080"," To me this looks like previous years where"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","254000","259200"," You have a continuation of sellers from Friday that are being absorbed this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","259840","264720"," For a move higher to 470 now we do have some major issues this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","264720","270600"," This will be good for the bears overall in that context, but I do want you to realize that in previous years"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","271520","274960"," Not just previous but every previous year on December opex"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","275040","281600"," We typically sell down in the on the Sunday to Monday. It would have been normal to have done this this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","282520","289040"," But we do have some problems in this morning specifically in the mechanics of this morning now we have to watch"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","289600","295200"," For sure to find out if we have bearish or bullish flow into the rest of today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","295600","302400"," That would confirm the bears thesis at this point because we are heading lower into bear country"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","303280","310560"," But do not be surprised if you were to see us swing up today to this 470 level. It's definitely on the table this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","311200","313200"," The bears want to be getting below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","314080","318560"," I'll show you here on the chart, but they want to be getting below 4500 this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","318640","320320"," That is their whole mission"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","320320","326680"," But you can see on the right here the buyers are stepping in in mass to take this much higher this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","327160","330000"," some expectation just by looking at book map as"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","330960","334320"," You might see a small quick tag at the open this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","335040","344000"," But if the if you get these buyers so these buyers were in here on friday into the clothes and the buyers are absorbing sellers no matter what anyone tells you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","345280","350480"," From I think it was like for no 330 into 6 p.m"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","351040","355360"," This the buyers were absorbing all the sellers the moment that the market closed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","356240","358480"," It looks like to me that that liquidity was thin"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","359120","364480"," You've got probably have hedge funds trying to drop it and spook the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","365600","368320"," And then of course this morning once the cash market opens"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","368800","374560"," Liquidity ramps back up the buyers ramp back up and you should see something like that at the open this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","374960","378800"," That's just from book map i'm going to turn it off right now and i'm going to talk to you about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","379120","382080"," I'm going to talk to you about because this book map takes up a ton of"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","383040","386320"," Computing power. So that's what I wanted to show you in book map"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","386320","388320"," And"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","388320","393920"," Then i'm going to show you what you need to be looking at and that would be this article came out"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","394400","397680"," I always like to read articles that are meant for main street people"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","398640","402880"," And last night there's an article that came out at 930 in the evening on cnn"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","403440","410160"," Now I like reading articles like this briefly because it's it's not for consumption of traders and invent or"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","411120","413600"," It's meant for investors and not traders"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","414480","419040"," And you've you've got it all being tied together where all of a sudden joe mansion"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","419600","423360"," And you've got the bbb as negative growth implications"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","424080","430480"," This is all bullshit by the way. You've got the bank gs has trimmed back their expectations"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","431200","434960"," Uh for forecasts for the second quarter of 3 from 3.5"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","434960","436400"," percent"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","436400","437840"," Yadda yadda yadda"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","437840","440320"," This morning, it's funny too because at the end of this article"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","441120","443360"," Gs says but the door is reopened"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","444560","447760"," That we still might have 3.5 percent on the menu. So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","449760","455040"," This looks like a lot of hot air and I wound up this morning briefly looking back at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","456080","458080"," CNBC last year in this date"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","459120","463840"," And on the date in 2019 and it was the same it was the same bullshit being talked about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","463920","468320"," Of course end of the day next day you check and all the losses were recovered"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","468800","471840"," So be careful if you're a bear today on that note on the news"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","473040","479040"," Uh, but we do have volatility. I expected us to have an update today or this to be the downest day of the week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","479600","487040"," With and with an update by end of day. Now on today. We have not many not many uh economic news points"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","487360","490160"," But tuesday, you know, we have biden coming out"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","490640","493200"," Uh, which will add volatility of the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","493600","499840"," Wednesday is a volatility day and thursday is probably the biggest volatility day that we have this week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","500000","502960"," So my expectation was today would be the the high of the week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","504560","507280"," Uh, but that's not looking like it this morning before the open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","507840","512240"," Us being this low and want to show you now is is bad is bad for the bulls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","512720","515600"," And we're going to talk about why right now. Okay, so"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","517360","519360"," This morning when we had tagged below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","520240","522240"," Or excuse me when we sold below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","522780","525680"," 4600 you can see right here. We broke below 4600"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","526480","528000"," in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","528000","530000"," Regardless if it's low liquidity"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","530480","536640"," When we start to break below here. We this is your gamma flip area. So we are a negative gamma at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","536960","542000"," This introduces volatility or negative volatility into the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","542880","546080"," And you're going to want if you're a bear out there listening to this broadcast"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","546640","549520"," You are going to want to see a retest this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","550160","553760"," Of the previous low down here at 4490"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","554400","556400"," Want to say that's at 4490 right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","557120","559920"," You want to see a break below this 44?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","561360","567280"," 91.25 on the es I know the number i'll look at the number on on spy this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","567280","572240"," But you want to see at the battle if you're a bear a push down you want to see red bars down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","572560","574560"," You want to see a break below this 449"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","575360","577360"," 1.25"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","577920","581520"," To signal a move a d away deeper move our wave"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","582080","585920"," larger move down lower to we'll start at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","586880","589040"," 4438"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","589040","591040"," and then"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","591840","594080"," That's only a small that would only be a small"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","594800","598640"," A small support you possibly find another support at 43 92"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","599200","603600"," And in reality you're looking for much deeper you want to you really if this breaks right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","603680","608560"," If we have this this one two and then a third retest if this were to fail"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","609200","610880"," this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","610880","612880"," You are looking to retest"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","613280","616480"," Ultimately 4267 to 4321"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","616960","618960"," So this is a critical moment for the bears this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","619440","624080"," Congratulations if you're a bear and you're out there listening to this or watching this broadcast this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","624080","629040"," We'll take a look real quick at the spy and this is kind of the same case"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","630880","633040"," You've got some recovery right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","633040","636800"," I showed you on book map that the sellers were above here at 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","637040","642720"," This would be a massive swing and you would probably expect more of a rejection at like 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","644000","650080"," This is I would call it at 465 things would start to get dangerous for bulls if we do swing high"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","650960","652960"," from this swing low"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","653440","657040"," Now inspired your your retest for bears is going to be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","657600","659520"," 448.93"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","660080","663200"," This is really what you want to be breaking this if you're a bear this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","663520","669120"," And this would confirm if we are actually in bear if we're in bear country down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","669120","671600"," This and this is we are definitely in negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","671920","676720"," The flip occurred right at the break here at 47 or excuse me 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","677120","680480"," I don't think it's 460.07. I think it's just 4600"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","680960","688000"," This break below here is a wants to or it's to test the lows again. Now, which is all that mean"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","689120","693600"," It means we could come down here test this for 48.93"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","694160","696160"," Hard reject and move higher"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","696640","701440"," Book map as you can see shows a steady supply of buyers coming into the open this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","701920","707280"," It's not like the river of liquidity has has dipped lower or we haven't seen the buying"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","708080","710720"," Into the bell this morning. It's already 904"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","711440","715520"," So there's a high possibility that we do try to swing back up at some point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","716080","720240"," I'm going to i'll check i'll track book mark book map as we"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","720800","725360"," Open this morning so that we can see if the buyers remain at the bell"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","726320","728560"," Or if they remove their buying power"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","729920","732080"," Sorry, hold on here. I'm trying to get a bunch of information out"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","732080","737920"," So this is important right here to know that we are now definitely in negative gamma territory"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","739120","742880"," There's been a gamma flip. There is real risk to you if you're a bull this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","743440","746320"," You want to be looking for buyers to step in right off the bell"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","747440","754240"," Step in hard. You want to see call flow coming out. I'll put the call flow up at 930 and be posting it for you live"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","755040","757920"," Or on the twitter handle so that you can see if we flip"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","758400","764480"," Bear if we stay bearish or if we're just testing for a higher move to this for back to this 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","765120","771360"," That you know things can get crazy here. Absolutely. You could see wild swings or a wild swing up today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","771760","776880"," Let's say we just wild swing up today bulls feel confident heading up to 465 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","777280","779680"," And then it's just straight sell down from there into"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","780640","782640"," the depths of hell on friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","783600","786720"," And you did you could do the depths of hell until biden speaks"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","787600","794880"," I don't know that his reassuring speeches will matter at that point. This looks something like a fight between jpm and gs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","795680","798800"," This morning. It seems like manufactured news"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","799520","802880"," And it looks like there's going to be a fight to see how low that we go"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","803120","811440"," Now I do want you to realize that if we break this four four eight nine three on cash spy that that is confirmation"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","812400","817120"," That would be a turn down and a rejection of the bull thesis at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","817600","820480"," So you would be you would you would not only be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","821200","826160"," Uh looking to break this but once this is broken you're going to be looking for much lower numbers 444"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","826640","828240"," 437"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","828240","830240"," You get some better numbers out here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","831040","833200"," Yeah, you'd want to test this whole zone down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","833600","836640"," You want to test down below here and start grinding through this wall"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","837280","839760"," Now I want to bring up some some of the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","840480","845040"," Volume profile for you this morning as well. And so this will should lend some better"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","845680","847360"," insight to the open this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","848320","855600"," If the bull step in this morning, there really isn't it's very thin above the sellers are thin here until we even begin to get to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","856480","858480"," let's call it 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","859440","866640"," Is probably the first node of some sellers, but your your real resistance above is right now at 468"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","866800","868800"," 8 638"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","868800","871360"," And then it's it's clear skies above from there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","871680","874400"," But we know that there are sellers hiding out up here at 40"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","874880","876880"," 46 86 4700"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","877280","881680"," They could disappear this happens on the up swings too just as much as the low swings"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","882080","884640"," But I want you to see this chart on es this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","885760","887920"," To see how volatile this morning could get"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","888560","893520"," Uh, so we really are looking to see at the opening bell right at 9 9 30"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","894160","896160"," Do the buyers remain"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","897120","900880"," To push us back up or do they disappear? That's how it happens"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","900880","905680"," So you'll see the river of buyers swoop up and pre-market and then around the open bell all of a sudden"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","905680","909520"," You'll see them either come in heavy or they disappear and we start heading lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","910560","915200"," So we'll we'll monitor this closely as the morning progresses. I will take a look at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","916080","918080"," let's go back to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","918480","920640"," Nq and rty this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","921120","923120"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","923120","929840"," Do want you to also realize that support and resistance levels will change as the day goes on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","930640","934640"," This is good to see believe it or not. This is the hard put wall and rty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","935040","938000"," And there was somewhat a river of recovery this morning here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","938480","940720"," I'll take a look at the book map for rty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","941360","943600"," This looks like a recovery in rty believe it or not"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","944160","947760"," I'm a little shocked at seeing this right here. It wasn't expecting to see this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","948720","950720"," That this two one two eight level"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","951840","960400"," Is actually fairly good. But again just as before we've been in negative gamut territory or we've been in a negative gamut flip on rty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","962080","964080"," So this is actually"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","964480","966800"," Making me think that it's like previous years"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","968160","973680"," Sorry, I've got a little bit of intergestion waking up and pounding coffee. Hold up. Let's do Nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","978000","980000"," All right. Yeah, Nq is not looking pretty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","980800","988320"," Uh, this is more than likely that whole so we talked I think we talked over the weekend about the possibility of squeezing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","988880","995040"," Nasdaq and nq due to the short every all the hedges are hello and nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","995680","997680"," Uh, that they've become very shortable"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","998720","1002400"," This one will be interesting to watch today because not only have we broken through the foot wall"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1003040","1011360"," But we're much much lower a breach of 15 562 is not good for the bulls in tech at all"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1012640","1014800"," We'd be looking to come down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1015760","1018800"," This is you see you've got your retest now on nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1018880","1020880"," This is not positive for tech"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1021280","1026640"," You don't want to see that you want to see this third read or this you could look at as a second door third retest"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1027120","1031520"," But the fact that we've breached on this retest to a new lower low"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1032000","1036640"," Definitely signals that the market will want to look for at minimum"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1037040","1043520"," 15 302 at minimum and there's nothing much. Oh, there. Well, there's a large node back here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1044160","1050240"," Uh, this there's fair support here down here at 1503, but you would think that not think that but"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1051520","1053520"," We definitely know just looking here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1054240","1056720"," That there should because we're already down at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1057280","1061680"," And nasdaq should sell off at some point at the open down to 15"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1062000","1063520"," 307"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1063520","1065600"," Uh, though there is large support down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1065600","1071760"," Let's take a look at and q as a matter of fact because that's the that's the best that's probably the best chance this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1072720","1075600"," that the the bears have to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1078960","1083200"," To make this happen probably not a small cap surprisingly"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1083200","1085200"," Right"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1085200","1087200"," Right down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1087760","1090320"," And let's put this on a larger time frame here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1091840","1094240"," Let's go with uh, this one"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1096400","1103600"," Let's go with 30 days. I don't think we need to do 15 minute. It seems a little crazy. I could do the one hour"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1107120","1108560"," That's pretty wild"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1108560","1110560"," That's pretty much a free fall"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1111200","1114240"," If there was a if there was any panic this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1115760","1119520"," Then I would say it's going to be there. They're they're hoping that it's going to be the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1121760","1125760"," The bear they're going to they're probably going to this is a huge see this right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1126320","1128800"," This is huge here for nq. This is probably"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1129200","1135360"," Turning into the crux of the market and even if there was recovery today you're talking about a pretty lot pretty substantial"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1135840","1137840"," grind higher at nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1138400","1144080"," This does not look good for the for the bulls in tech"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1146240","1151040"," There is some some real resistance this morning. It's pretty good. Good job bears"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1151840","1158080"," I am impressed. I have to let you I have to tell you that I am impressed 90 days"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1159520","1162240"," And yeah, just the four hours. This should do it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1162560","1164560"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1164560","1170000"," This is a bigger so this is important for you bears and bulls to see where we are right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1171520","1174320"," Nq is going to take some real work to get through here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1174720","1181520"," Otherwise, it's going to be down here retesting the first resistance this morning should be at 15 4 44"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1182000","1183440"," 0.87"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1183440","1185360"," And then if you grind through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1185360","1189120"," This is this is a free fall down to 15 107 this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1189600","1193040"," You can see that this would be your first heavy resistance"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1193680","1196800"," 15 107 keep that in mind"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1197840","1200560"," And we're really going back here. You're going back to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1201840","1203360"," October"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1203360","1209040"," 4th like no October 11th. You'd be heading back to all the way back to October 11th for nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1209600","1215280"," So I would expect that that's going to be the expectation that you've got some heavy shorts in nasdaq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1215520","1218080"," They want that last minute of capitulation"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1218640","1221360"," This morning so you get that first slam down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1222240","1230000"," 15 4 4 4 and then they would have to grind through a bunch of this to hit to slam down on this 15 107"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1231440","1233440"," So this is not so nq is probably looking"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1235280","1238800"," The weakest at this point. I'm actually surprised to see that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1242080","1244080"," Let's take a look at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1244080","1257360"," Let's take a look at the rut. We'll do that same"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1258800","1261760"," Now we already know the rut looks bad, but the rut's pretty much held up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1262160","1264880"," I got to give it to the rut. It's the rut is huge"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1265600","1267600"," so when you're talking about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1268160","1270160"," Killing the rut. It's like"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1270160","1272160"," It's brutal"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1272400","1274480"," The rut is not the fun one to be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1276400","1278400"," 4 or 180 day"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1281840","1283840"," Yeah, the ruts already been been wrecked"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1286480","1287920"," Mmm"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1287920","1291840"," That have to look deeper into the rut. I know for sure that the rut is looking for"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1292240","1297120"," It would be a major sell-down in the rut. I think the ruts actually looking stronger to be quite honest with you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1297760","1301040"," If the ruts actually looking a lot stronger this morning than nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1301840","1310320"," So nq I think we talked about a fall to 300. That's all bullshit. The real fall would be somewhere down here 15 100"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1312240","1313920"," It's going to be really it's really going to be looking"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1314880","1319040"," Looking for some form of a free fall down here. There's not much holding up nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1319600","1325680"," There's less than you think is holding up nq. There's one small there's that one small node here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1326480","1328480"," at 15 400"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1331600","1333280"," Somewhere in here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1333280","1335600"," That's just a really small node. It's not that big"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1336320","1338960"," They're gonna definitely if I was a short I'd want to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1339680","1345440"," I've not only want to touch this but grind through this node over here and take us down to this 15 100"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1345520","1348800"," Just do the retest get it over with it in NASDAQ"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1349120","1353360"," This would also look like a last moment capitulation move this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1354160","1356160"," at the open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1356720","1358720"," That's pretty neat. Good job"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1359680","1361680"," I am impressed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1361840","1364560"," And then we're going to head back over here and just do a quick auto"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1368720","1371520"," Yeah, and you can see you can see the buyers stepping in down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1371920","1375920"," We have liquidity down here. We have buyers and we had them into this close"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1376320","1378560"," It didn't look like it into this closed on friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1378560","1383200"," But we did this could be an extension of the buyers stepping into the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1383600","1388240"," The smart money stepping in and we could swing higher but nq to me is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1388800","1392240"," If there was a crux to the market this morning to do this retest down below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1392720","1395120"," It would be that nq sells off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1395520","1401520"," There's panic by bulls last bulls that are left in the market for a better price for banks to buy this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1402560","1404560"," So I wouldn't surprise me to see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1404880","1409680"," You you definitely i'm going to be looking for any and all nq put flow this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1410080","1413040"," that's that's what the weakness is for sure and"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1414080","1415280"," I mean"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1415280","1419360"," RTY IWM it's such a it's such a huge index"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1419920","1425600"," To see it start to crash here. It's tough. It's tough for me to see or IWM crashing that deep"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1425840","1428400"," We'll take a look at uh, I don't know if I showed you RTY"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1429920","1433360"," Let's take a look at RTY where they're first just so you can have some numbers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1440480","1442480"," Let's do a one year"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1443440","1446960"," Yeah, and then RTY got bought back up this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1447520","1451840"," That's not I don't I don't see RTY following that hard, but if you were looking for a target"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1452240","1456640"," I would try 205 206 and then 1989"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1457200","1458400"," Whoo-hoo"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1458400","1461760"," I would be your next move down and you've got a little bit of a node right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1462160","1464160"," And then a little bit of pear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1464160","1467600"," If the if RTY if if the rut was starting to sell off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1468080","1470240"," This would be this would this would be the market crash"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1470880","1476080"," scenario right here because this one could take you down to the trade that took place heading into"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1476880","1481760"," 2020 uh the 2020 covid trade and that that low is way lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1482880","1484960"," 1,700 1587"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1484960","1489520"," It's pretty low. It's even lower. I bet it's down here at 1648"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1490480","1492800"," This is the doom and gloom bear scenario down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1493040","1494880"," This would be juicy actually"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1494880","1498400"," If you bought puts here and we sold down into this zone down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1498880","1500880"," You make you probably make"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1501040","1504000"," Probably turn 50 grand into a lot of money"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1505600","1507600"," A lot more than you think"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1507920","1510560"," All right, let's see what you guys are at. Let's see what you guys are asking"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1511520","1515120"," Yeah, vix is coming down. We talked about so we did talk about last week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1515440","1517200"," If you remember if you're calling at the end of the week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1517920","1520720"," I didn't like the idea that the vix wasn't at 30"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1521200","1524080"," I wanted to see though at the high 24 and 27"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1524960","1526320"," Vix get"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1526320","1529600"," Vix get uh filled for santa rally"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1529920","1536000"," Also, remember that traditionally the santa rally does not begin until the day after christmas"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1536480","1540000"," Whatever you see me posting about santa rally. It's more of a ribbing to people"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1540400","1545680"," Uh that I want the santa rally to start earlier than normal or whatever, but it's typically not until after the 25th"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1546720","1548720"," Traditionally"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1549600","1553760"," Buyers should have stepped up by now. They did step up. You can see the buyers just so you guys"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1554080","1559040"," Yeah, the rustle the rustle right has a lot of investors in it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1560000","1562000"," The rustle is going to be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1562000","1566320"," I hate the rustle but to kill the rustle for where it's at is going to take"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1567360","1572000"," Seriously tons of grinding. It is the backbone of our of our financial system, basically"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1572880","1577440"," Uh, no, there's no real trap. You guys got to be I want you guys to see this stuff once more, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1577680","1582400"," I'm gonna head back real quick and show you guys about this thing that you're talking about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1582480","1584720"," I'm gonna re I want to recap something for you this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1585520","1588720"," For anyone that's that's listening right now. So just to start off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1589760","1592640"," Every year on the monday of opex we sell off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1593200","1597360"," And then we end up swinging swinging higher every single year. It's the norm"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1597760","1602800"," Now we did not catch the bid this morning like we normally do normally by 11 a.m"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1603280","1604720"," You'd see like a"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1604720","1611840"," Anywhere from like a depending upon how big the end or it's been smaller in previous years due to the size of s of the spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1612720","1617360"," Or rvs yes s and p 500 so you would see this is normal actually"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1617440","1621200"," So you should go back yourself look at previous mondays of opex"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1621680","1622640"," on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1622640","1625760"," On december opex and you'll see the same event takes place"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1627120","1629120"," I'm going to reopen bookmark"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1629200","1634320"," Book map because they did turn it off earlier and I want you guys to see book map"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1635520","1637520"," It's going to slow down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1637520","1639680"," My streaming at this point, but I want you to see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1640640","1644080"," The potential this morning. I just want to rehash that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1645120","1647680"," If you are a bear you are looking to retest the lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1648960","1651680"," On the spy from the previous lows that we had"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1654320","1657120"," I want you though to still see that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1661040","1665520"," Sellers are being absorbed at this point. We only have 10 minutes left, but I want you guys to see this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1666480","1668480"," so that you can"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","1757520","1759680"," Do you see down here in the bottom right? You've got"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1760880","1762880"," 216,000 buy orders"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1763200","1770400"," And only 141 sal orders coming into the open so just be cautious this morning as a bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1770880","1772880"," Please be cautious"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1772960","1777680"," Uh, I am on the bear side at this point. Just just if you want to know we are in bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1778000","1780160"," but we're in negative gamma flip at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1780800","1783920"," which makes the environment very volatile and"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1784720","1788880"," Also at this point we're so low that you do want to retest the lows previous lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1789440","1790800"," For two reasons"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1790800","1796320"," It shows if we want to go lower right so we switch to to being full-time bears"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1796880","1798880"," And we take this market much lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1800080","1803920"," And it also will reinforce that we're going to head back up for the bulls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1804640","1806880"," So at this point, I'm turning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1808000","1809440"," Turning bearish"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1809440","1811440"," But you can see down below here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1812240","1815680"," 258 and the seller is a 141 465"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1816080","1819360"," This looks like every previous of monday opex to me still"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1819920","1825040"," Where it was a low liquidity environment when we closed at 6 p.m. On friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1825680","1831600"," There the bears are being or the sellers are being absorbed then and then we had this low liquidity environment over the weekend"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1832640","1834960"," You can see that river of smart money is buying"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1835520","1838080"," Down here and so my expectation today would be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1838880","1842640"," That let's say we let's say we head back up to 460 minimum"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1843040","1846080"," Maybe we fake the bulls out and then head lower to do a retest"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1846560","1853840"," But at any point if the buyers stay in charge here and continue to buy 470 is easily on the table today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1854880","1860400"," Easily if the buyer if the sellers are absorbed. So i'm going to turn this one off real quick one more time for you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1861600","1864720"," Because it does drain my computing power"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1865680","1868240"," I do want you guys to see that we're going to head back to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1869840","1871840"," Spy real quick here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1872640","1874640"," And just and just to recap so"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1875440","1880400"," The bear the bears you you want to test this this today you want to test it today if not into end of week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1880960","1885120"," If let's say we do a swing high to 460 or even 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1885520","1889200"," You still want to you want to reject off that you want to find the sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1889920","1894480"," Uh that are that will sell their positions at 460 or 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1895840","1899680"," We bounce and head lower that would be the key heading into"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1900640","1903760"," The economic news that we have on Tuesday or excuse me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1905120","1907920"," Whatever Biden bullshit that's going to happen on Tuesday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1908960","1912080"," And then the potential negative new economic news on wednesday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1913520","1916000"," And even as a bull you want to see this retest down below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1916960","1923360"," Because if this retest takes place down here at 448.93 and the bears are out able to break through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1924000","1929200"," It gives some resolution to our our outlook on the market. It makes us turn into bears"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1930560","1934160"," Selling everywhere permanently until we go much much lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1934560","1940560"," It also would give some resolution to the bulls if you have three retests of this low low down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1941040","1945200"," It would be resolution to bulls that this market definitely wants to go long"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1946080","1948000"," And to be honest"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1948000","1951440"," We've been in this in this area here for two months"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1951920","1959200"," So if this leads to some resolution whether it's to to all-time highs or it leads to us selling the market down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1959680","1962480"," From this point forward into the beyond the new year"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1963040","1967040"," It would actually probably take us into the end of march at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1967440","1970400"," Uh, then so be it. Absolutely. I'm on board that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1970960","1976160"," Either way, and I think that bulls and bears are probably on bull that it's on board that at some point today as well"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1976800","1978800"," And just to recap"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1978800","1981520"," RTY is going to be difficult to grind through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1982160","1987760"," Nq is looking if I was to if I were to guess nq is looking the most shady today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1988320","1990640"," It's the one that could sell off the bell"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1991360","1993360"," It's you can panic"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1994080","1995440"," tech bulls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1995440","1997440"," into that last bit of"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","1998400","2003120"," Capitulation today and we saw that on the we saw that on the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2004080","2008640"," Nasdaq node already right you guys noticed the Nasdaq already"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2010160","2014640"," I'm just gonna I'm gonna stop what i'm doing here and i'm gonna pay attention to you guys and your questions"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2016640","2018800"," And I just want I hope that you guys bought"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2020080","2022080"," I keep telling you guys to to buy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2022960","2026240"," I haven't looked I even looked at my brokerage yet. So i'm a little spooked"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2027440","2029680"," I have to check my brokerage because I've got uh"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2030640","2036560"," I've got one tiny hedge, but I'm sure that a ton of my a lot of my longs are probably fine at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2036960","2040320"," but my I definitely have a few racks of"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2041120","2044720"," I've got four 70s expiring today that are probably"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2045360","2048560"," Worthless probably worth pennies a penny if i'm lucky"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2050720","2057120"," Trap long and me s nq now. There's no real trap longs. Oh, there's some trap longs at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2058000","2063200"," There but it wouldn't be it wouldn't surprise me to go to 470 today. So I would be careful about that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2065280","2067440"," Oh, yeah, so i'm not selling my 1231 calls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2067520","2073440"," I have a hedge on my longer out stuff and a lot of my some of my 1231 calls are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2074160","2077520"," spreads so they're irrelevant they don't really pay attention to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2078400","2083280"," The ivy and all the all the noise that's going on as long as we keep going up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2084160","2089120"," There is one more thing that I want to let bulls and bears know is that there was a massive"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2089840","2095680"," uh call spread put on friday for four six five zero four seven zero zero"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2096160","2097920"," expiring this friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2097920","2103360"," I need to take a look and see if that big uh that big whale closes his position today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2103760","2108240"," If he closes his position that's on the spx by the way if you guys want to look on your own"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2109360","2113040"," If he closes his position that would be a huge negative for the markets"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2113600","2114960"," Uh"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2114960","2117680"," Yeah, no see see I think that and q can go lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2117760","2125600"," I think nq can go down easily to a retest of 15091 today without a doubt. I'm bearish on an nq right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2127600","2131360"," Uh, no, uh, you can get a swing to 16 900 absolutely"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2132800","2135280"," Didn't buy insurance. Uh, that sucks"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","2287680","2292240"," Let me just a second here. I've booked mark book maps not wanting to start"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2312320","2318800"," So you've got this huge note down here of buyers. You can see the smart money is down below here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2325920","2327920"," This should be helping you guys this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2328320","2332160"," This is a really tight range on the bell. I'm not gonna lie. Uh, so you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2332960","2338640"," You will see some some some sellers have come down. You'll see that some supply has come down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2339520","2341520"," to four fifty five"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2341840","2344160"," And you've got buyers at four fifty three"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2346000","2348000"," Off the open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2349280","2355120"," My putt hedge is not doing that well. It's at the same price that it was on friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2356560","2359200"," Which is kind of bullshit that kind of pisses me off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2361200","2363200"," And we really don't have"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2364160","2369600"," We really don't have a bid on the options chain either look at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2373120","2380320"," Yeah, so I had spy in my my spy hedges. It's not that uh, it's not doing that way. It's not that good"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2385760","2387760"," I have to sell my spy hedge"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2394160","2399040"," My spy hedge did not make me as much as I thought it would"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2405680","2407920"," Not impressed with the with the spy hedge"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2423360","2425360"," Let's take a look"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2425360","2428160"," Yeah, so this isn't this isn't telling us too much right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2430080","2437200"," It's cloud so you've got a lot just so you can see down below here in the right hand side. You've got 400 almost 500 000 buyers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2438080","2440320"," So you've got 20 percent more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2441120","2443120"," buyers than you have sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2444000","2448640"," Smart money staying down here at four forty four five two you can see down here in the bottom right hand side"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2448960","2452560"," four seven eight four seven nine eight three three four zero"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2453200","2455520"," So this looks like it looks like it's going up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2456160","2460080"," If you want to if you want me to tell you what it looks like or my interpretation of it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2462800","2468560"," And you can see sellers being absorbed in a better on a better time frame. I'll bring it even closer here for you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2475200","2477200"," You can also see that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2478880","2480880"," Sellers have moved down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2481040","2485760"," The the sea of sellers that were above at this 470 have now come down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2486960","2490800"," But the moment the cash market opened the buyers stepped right in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2491440","2496000"," So this is pretty no this pretty nose to nose right now. This is this is pretty neat to watch"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2499600","2501920"," This might give you some better some better ideas"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2502720","2506720"," So the smart money has moved straight up into this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2509040","2511600"," Into this area of indecision at the moment"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2517040","2522800"," This is this is not that bearish. I want you to be aware of that right now if any of you are still listening or watching right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2523600","2529360"," So I sold my and that does represent the options chain for December 20th expiration"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2529840","2531680"," Got wrecked right off the bell"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2531760","2535760"," Even if you were a bear if you were a bear out there, I just I had a hedge on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2536480","2538800"," 20th expiry and I made 10 percent"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2540080","2543040"," I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of pissed about that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2544800","2551040"," And bears have now re-entered the 450p trade for 1220"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2552480","2554720"," They want to see the they want to see 420"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2555440","2559840"," Or excuse me 122420. They want to see 122450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2560560","2564560"," On the markets, but we're not showing that happening right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2565120","2568800"," Nothing's leading me to believe that we're going to go down to 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2571440","2573440"," Bires have completely stopped in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2574160","2577760"," They are here. So my expectation would be that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2579040","2582080"," Let me see if I can make this a little bit wider here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2582080","2584080"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2587520","2589520"," I'm not even looking at a chart"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2591360","2594240"," I don't even have a chart up. I'm just watching the book map right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2594560","2598640"," And there's not there's nothing here saying you've got buyer buyers are winning right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2598960","2604160"," Just to heads up. This is the real this so this is the real time of how I take a day trade at the bell"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2605360","2607680"," And nothing here is saying that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2609040","2611040"," You should see weakness"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2612080","2614080"," in this first 15 minutes"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2614960","2617600"," Regardless, I don't I don't care what anybody says"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2618880","2620880"," On that. Let me take a look here and flow. I'll go"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2627920","2629920"," Let me open the flow. I'll go and see what's going on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2632560","2634560"," I can't see you guys at the more I can see you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2635120","2639360"," But not at the moment. We switch back and forth. See how many you guys have paid attention"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2640160","2641120"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2641120","2648400"," Levelish we wait didn't buy insurance. I wm getting hammered. I haven't looked at my wm calls. We look"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2649040","2651040"," See if they're ugly"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2652480","2658640"," My wm calls are still fine. I bought them at the one of the worst moments in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2659440","2664720"," so they're they were green when we had it we've got into today and they are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2665520","2669200"," They're taking a small hit. It's not that bad"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2670160","2672000"," Some I'm fine with that for the moment"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2672720","2679200"," Let's see what's going on with the market this morning. Yeah, it's calls. We're at the gate this morning. Sq has a large"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2680240","2684400"," Sq has a large hedge put on it for February 18th"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2686160","2691440"," Oh, no, that was on that was on friday scratch that but we have major call flow coming in this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2692000","2696160"," We've got bulls stepping in on calls on the spy specifically"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2697440","2699440"," Which sounds logical"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2699440","2702800"," The the buyers are absorbing sellers right now on the spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2703840","2707680"," I would expect at least to push up to a minimum of"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2709760","2714720"," If the well if the bears if the bears get absorbed here or if the sellers get absorbed here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2715280","2718160"," I'm not seeing a wall right now for how high we can go"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2718960","2721440"," It's you can see here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2723760","2727440"," Yeah, you can see here this if the if the sellers are absorbed here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2728400","2735360"," 460 is going to be the first keep this I want you to put this on your charts today that 460 will be the first"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2736560","2738400"," Resistance level for the bulls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2739040","2744000"," If there was a chance of hitting 450 today or to retest previous lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2744480","2747520"," You're going to be looking for 460 as a rejection point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2748160","2752080"," But in reality that there's it's it's the skies are blue"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2752640","2757120"," That's not really a large node of sellers up here. You want it. I want it. You want to see something"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2758480","2760480"," More substantial at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2761200","2764800"," So 470 is the next one that I saw from earlier"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2766480","2768480"," See if we can look at the 470 node"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2770000","2772000"," Now you can still see it right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2772640","2777760"," So my expectation would be we see 460 here in the next"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2779120","2781120"," Well, I don't know"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2781120","2787520"," We're definitely seeing 460 I guarantee it. Well, that definitely I give it like a 80% chance that we see 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2788720","2790720"," From this point looking forward"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2791840","2793840"," Almost 100% chance"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2796000","2801360"," And you can see the buyers are still winning. Nothing's changed here buyers buyers are in control"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2803760","2805440"," 100%"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2805520","2809520"," You'll see some probably some day trades coming in for let me see if I can see any of this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2810240","2814640"," Yeah, this now there's a ton of you got neo calls coming in disney calls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2815440","2819200"," and video calls be a calls spy calls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2821040","2824640"," And there the spy calls are all centered around 458"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2827200","2831280"," For 65 calls for the spy this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2833200","2835200"," All right"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2836000","2841360"," Yeah, this the buyers are stepping in you can see on the bottom right hand side. I think you guys can see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2842080","2844080"," We're now up to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2844720","2848000"," 727,000 buyers to 594 sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2850400","2852400"," The ramp is on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2854000","2856000"," The ramp is definitely on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2862640","2864640"," Let me take a look and see what your questions are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2866400","2868400"," You guys seeing this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2869040","2875200"," Or if I have one cent each yeah, I can't believe that they're so dirt cheap. It has to be because of the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2876560","2879840"," Because of the thin liquidity today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2882240","2884240"," I'm gonna have to trade this today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2890640","2892640"," So 458"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2893440","2894640"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2894640","2896480"," 456 seems logical"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2897280","2901360"," You could take for you could definitely get for 456 or trading at 90 cents"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2901840","2903840"," 94 cents the dollar"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2903840","2905840"," Yeah, 456 should hit"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2906400","2909040"," Now the now 456 is gaining some value here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2909840","2915120"," It could easily go in the money and tag a dollar or 70 dollar 80 something like that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2917120","2922480"," And there is there's someone out there some some auto bought out there has bought a ton of 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2923600","2927680"," But I don't think it matters. I think you see I think you easily see 460 today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2929440","2930560"," Easily"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2930560","2935040"," So this is interesting to watch because I'm watching the chains on one computer"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2935520","2941040"," And then I'm watching book map here and you can see the difference you can see the separation start to begin"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2942240","2946960"," If you look at this red line below, this is where the smart money is down here at 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2948320","2951360"," And you'll see the concentration of sellers at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2953440","2955440"," And"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2955440","2957440"," Hopefully you guys can see that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2959920","2963840"," And then down here you can see on the right hand side that the buyers are in control"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2966800","2969360"," Even if you see some hedging coming in at 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2971760","2975280"," Buyers are definitely in control. Yeah, and you can see that 456 is going up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2975840","2979200"," So they were down at like 60 to 80 cents. They're now at a dollar 14"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2980160","2982640"," If you guys watch the options chains, I don't know"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2983440","2990320"," I hope that was an easy play 456 c on a on a one day fd should print heavy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2993280","2995600"," And well, I shouldn't say should it already is printing heavy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2997520","2999520"," Now it's up to a dollar 21"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","2999840","3005040"," That should hit 150 160 to 170 minimum at 456 c"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3005760","3007760"," And"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3007760","3013200"," Unless anything changes right now you've got both those are our sellers are being absorbed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3014400","3016960"," Let me go back and see what you guys are asking"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3021520","3023520"," Yeah, this is all real-time information"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3023840","3028080"," You can't get any more real time than this unless you have a black box"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3028800","3030640"," This is as this is as real as it gets"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3031440","3033280"," No matter what anyone's telling you out there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3034000","3039680"," Book map is as good as any uh, oh your hedge now joe"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3042560","3044000"," Too funny"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3044000","3049280"," Yeah, so we are in so we are we're definitely just so you guys know be 100% honest, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3049840","3052800"," You guys have to you guys have to tell you if you're a bull out there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3052800","3057520"," You have to know that we are in a negative and a negative gamma now with gamma flip to negative"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3059120","3061760"," You should see us push higher to at least 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3062240","3065920"," There are sellers above you see this this is called ice up here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3066400","3070560"," You know you'll hear people say this is the ice area at 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3071200","3075120"," There's some ice in here too between 454 and 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3075520","3078800"," But you can see that the that the buyers are overwhelming the sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3079680","3085920"," We couldn't grind through the sellers on friday. There wasn't enough runway as they say there wasn't enough time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3086400","3087920"," In the day on friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3088000","3092720"," That's paul positives for the bulls or to at least unmet on an F yourself today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3093120","3097280"," If you want the chance to on F yourself, I would look for a move higher"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3097920","3102480"," If we let's say we get to 460 and you're in some messed up calls that you don't think are coming back"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3102560","3104400"," That would be the time to get out of them"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3104400","3107680"," Uh, but you are looking for some resolution today and into this week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3108080","3112400"," You know if you're a bull or a bear you still want to see us retest this low"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3112880","3114480"," And break through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3114480","3118160"," Or we reject because you guys all know that when you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3118960","3121520"," When you're testing a lower high for the third time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3122160","3126480"," It usually leads to some resolution in the market it usually leads to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3126960","3130000"," All-time highs or a move much much much lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3130880","3132880"," And that would put us into bear country"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3133040","3135760"," Once you retest that low if we break through that low"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3136160","3140160"," You can then take your bull caps off and switch to full bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3140560","3143200"," You're pretty much just we're going down at that point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3143920","3149520"," There'll be no more bull bears or there'll be no more day trader stuff you would switch to the other side"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3151920","3156240"," And if we don't and if we reject off that low if we reject off of"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3156880","3158800"," That previous low down there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3158800","3160800"," then you would be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3161360","3165520"," Looking to put a bulk bulk cap on if you were a bear because you rejected again"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3166160","3168160"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3169600","3171600"," Yeah, my hedges didn't move either"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3172240","3178080"," My yeah, my my my hedges suck this morning. I am not a fan of my hedging this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3178560","3179280"," I'm pissed off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3179280","3181760"," So if you get anybody out there telling you they made money on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3182400","3188960"," On put hedges or even going shorter over the weekend. It was not as good as it should have been I can promise you that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3190160","3194400"," I can promise you that if you were short over unless you are just short maybe in futures"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3194960","3199760"," I in the cash market. I don't think bears did as well as they're claiming because I have some bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3199920","3201360"," I have some bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3201360","3204960"," Puts on and they're not they're not doing it as well as I anticipated"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3208160","3211600"," Tesla is disappointed. Can you turn up the volume? Yes, you guys can't hear me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3214960","3219040"," What level was the gamma flip so gamma flip was at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3220880","3222880"," That turned us into negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3223200","3225200"," and the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3225200","3235600"," Confirmation was the break of support at four five hundred now at 40 excuse me four five five zero and four five"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3236160","3239120"," Yeah, four five five zero once we broke through there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3239200","3245520"," But there is a caveat to this stuff and that is that the Monday after opex"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3246640","3250800"," We're doing this in a low liquidity environment when we hit the overnight low"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3251440","3257360"," There was liquidity of 20 I think it was is either 60,000 or 26,000"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3258560","3260560"," shares traded"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3261040","3263920"," You can't have that low volume in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3264800","3270160"," A sell down this low and not expect a reaction like this on the open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3270800","3272400"," You just can't"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3272400","3274960"," if this is this is used oftentimes"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3275920","3277920"," as a"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3278240","3281920"," It's it's used on the bull and bear side to get us where we need to be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3282480","3284400"," to check to see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3284400","3286560"," Hey, are we going lower or are we going higher?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3287040","3294400"," You'll see that sometimes futures you'll see the the push futures up to the next level because you can't get it done in cash market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3295200","3297040"," It's for that look above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3297040","3299840"," And certainly this morning this was for a look below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3300400","3305200"," To head lower because we did reject off all-time highs and we did hit all-time highs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3306000","3312480"," This past run by a few ticks and we immediately rejected off that last look above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3312480","3316720"," We had was not good for bulls. You don't want to see you look above and not go"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3317040","3321360"," So if you look above and you don't go then we're going to head lower to check the lows again"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3321840","3328400"," And we knew on friday that we couldn't go any lower in cash markets. So the futures did it for us"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3330160","3333520"," Yeah, we've got a million buys coming in if you look in the bottom right hand side down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3334320","3336320"," If you guys can see that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3336800","3338880"," The buyers are certainly stepping in this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3339920","3344560"," You got if you guys are just tuning in you'll see above we've got some sellers at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3344960","3347200"," We've got some ice above at 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3350240","3354160"," This should be a grind off the open you can see we're kind of we're kind of stuck right now, right?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3354560","3359520"," We're at 45359. We've been grinding here for some period of time now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3360320","3362320"," And this is just an extension of friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3363680","3365680"," Just"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3366640","3368640"," Just an extension of friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3373360","3374560"," If you were to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3374560","3379440"," In reality looking at it. This is the opex hasn't ended in some in some context"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3380080","3382960"," Even though we're lower it's just more absorption"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3387280","3391040"," You want to pay attention when you see these big red bulbs here these big red balls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3391840","3394160"," You can see that the spreads becoming tighter"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3395520","3398320"," We're at 105,000 or 1.4"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3401600","3409440"," Okay, am I on this right? Yeah, or 1.05 million and 90980 on the sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3411600","3417120"," At 452, but I wouldn't I wouldn't be too scared right so this this node down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3417760","3420240"," This is real liquidity is it's right at 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3422000","3428400"," So any dips down to 450 right now, you will see a major reaction. You'll see a big green bar"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3432560","3435040"," Let me see if you guys have any questions at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3437600","3439840"," Well levels gamma flip or if you answer that one"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3440480","3443440"," Jim Kramer just tested positive left my ass off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3443920","3445920"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3447360","3452720"," Yeah, so i'm holding everything I haven't sold anything yet. I haven't even sold my my zero dates for today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3454000","3458480"," And I haven't sold my hedge or I sold my hedge for spy that that expired today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3459120","3462880"," I think I made 10% I think I bought it at 70 cents and I think I sold it for like"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3463520","3466400"," 74 cents or something it was not doing well"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3468000","3470000"," So what would I be looking forward to do today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3470960","3474560"," I will be looking to buy another hedge at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3475600","3478960"," Without a doubt and this one would be deeper outside the money"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3480800","3484880"," I would be looking for let me take a look at me open a chart on a different laptop"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3486080","3488320"," I would be looking for something into end of week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3500960","3502960"," Let's take a look"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3507120","3513760"," So what I would expect for this morning or this is my expectation is that we go up to at least 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3517440","3519440"," Hold on hang tight here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3523520","3525280"," Spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3525280","3528720"," Yeah, and you can see you can see out of you. I'm just grinding down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3530160","3532000"," Like a weekly"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3532000","3534400"," 448 p would be nice tone"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3535040","3540160"," But I would rather own it at the 460 level and not at not right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3541200","3545680"," I guess you could you could buy it here. I just don't want to see a swing higher to 460 and then sell down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3548160","3551520"," I'd really like to see us push up above here to 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3552160","3554880"," And then take on another hedge a better hedge"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3555840","3557680"," I'm not impressed with my hedge from friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3558640","3561040"," My head I had a hedge on from"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3561760","3565520"," Thursday open and that printed well, but I closed that one out"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3566640","3570560"," Friday and then bought another one along with a ton of fd's for the open today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3571840","3573840"," So i'm not really"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3574560","3578880"," I didn't do I positioned poorly on my hedge for much for today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3579920","3582000"," And I burned all my fd's for today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3582960","3584960"," It cost me some money"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3585760","3586720"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3586720","3589600"," I lost this one. I lost one"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3592560","3597920"," Maybe bring this a little bit out for you here. You might be seeing some weakness here, but it's not really"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3599680","3602320"," You can see that the buyers are down here at 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3602720","3605200"," You've got more buyers here at 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3605760","3609040"," And you can see that the sellers are just weak here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3609040","3611040"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3611040","3615120"," I might actually take a long here another I might take another fd this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3616560","3620960"," Another call fd actually right in this zone right where we are right now. I might take one"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3622800","3624800"," I look a little bit closer here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3625600","3627600"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3627600","3631680"," So give me just a second here and I'll tell you what i'm buying here in just a minute"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3633120","3635120"," There is some put flow coming in i'm surprised"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3635600","3640240"," There is some spy put flow coming in just want to let you guys know 122450s"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3642800","3650240"," I don't think you need to get the 450 or I would do 448 it so there's a lot of uh 122450p's coming in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3651120","3654880"," The safer bet is most definitely 1223"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3656720","3659520"," 448s are probably the better bets"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3660480","3667360"," I'm surprised that they got them so close and are so so closely dated. There's a lot of Tesla calls coming in right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3668320","3670320"," 930 c's"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3670800","3672800"," We take a look at Tesla and see what it's doing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3673520","3678480"," Yeah, this is not the place we want to be taking puts this is the place where you we want to be taking the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3680160","3682160"," longs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3682160","3684160"," The"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3687040","3689680"," The move was already made as they say"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3690880","3692880"," Yeah, tesla's looking pretty spicy right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3693760","3696400"," So I can see why people want to be going long and tesla right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3697040","3702000"," But you can see that the liquidity is here. So if you're a bear right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3703600","3706320"," You want to see this river of liquidity kind of disappear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3707520","3710720"," If you're a bull right here anything at 450 you're buying"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3711520","3713520"," All day long"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3713920","3716480"," There is minor support right here at 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3717680","3720240"," It's not like so usually when i'm day trading"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3721600","3724640"," I'll see a spread that's like the the buyers are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3725440","3727440"," 3 4 5 points away"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3728560","3730560"," The buyers are so close right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3731280","3733280"," that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3734240","3738480"," We will have a tendency to move up. Let's look to see where the sellers are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3739280","3741280"," You can also see the sellers are now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3742080","3744000"," raising"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3744000","3749520"," The wall it was at 460 now. It's looks like it's creeping up like 460 50"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3750080","3752160"," 461"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3752160","3754160"," Yeah, so you're starting to see a bid in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3755760","3757760"," Which is good if you're a bull"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3758080","3760080"," if you're a bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3760080","3762400"," I didn't make any money off my my puts"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3763360","3770320"," So you want to reposition at 460 would be the safe place here tesla is ripping right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3770960","3772960"," tesla is squeezing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3775520","3777520"," That's a good apple"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3778160","3780160"," Apple squeezing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3780160","3785600"," Yeah, all these stocks are squeezing they should continue to squeeze too. There should be some squeeze in this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3787760","3790400"," So i'm assuming that you get some tech squeezing this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3793280","3796400"," And yeah, you can see that reaction on the spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3797120","3799120"," That's a no-brainer buying on 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3800000","3806240"," You're going to get a reaction on 452. You're going to get a huge reaction on 450 this morning huge"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3806880","3810720"," You know, these are the buyers that what that didn't have the chance to buy on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3811440","3818240"," Friday there wasn't enough liquidity in time they call it a runway or a ramp not a rut ramp"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3818240","3820240"," It's called it's yeah, it's called runway"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3820320","3822320"," It just wasn't enough time in the day"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3822480","3825920"," For all of the sellers and buyers to get together"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3826720","3828720"," Or at the price they wanted to get together either"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3831360","3835520"," So the my anticipation is that we go up to 460 minimum"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3836080","3838400"," And then we might uh reject there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3839040","3842000"," And then we'll come back down to retest that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3842320","3843440"," 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3843440","3846880"," And if you're a bull you want to see that you want to see the test on 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3847440","3850800"," If you're a bull you want to see the the retest if you're a bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3851360","3854720"," You want to see the retest because it gives resolution to the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3856160","3860560"," It's going to tell you are we bearish or or are we bullish?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3861360","3867680"," It would it would end the bullshit with up and down and up and down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3867680","3869680"," You"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3874960","3878080"," Guys watching this let me go check back and see what you guys are saying this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3881760","3885520"," What did you have had 460 I'd force I had 455s"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3891840","3893760"," Yeah, they weren't bangers brad"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3893760","3897360"," I was expecting like 300 brother and I did not get 300"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3900160","3902720"," Texts I was by calls dated this week just my thought"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3903280","3910080"," Yeah, you know the the setup on the setup on this morning if I had to guess it was so you guys that you guys should go back"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3910160","3914000"," And look at previous opx mondays for december"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3914400","3917760"," They're they're all the same. We are very weak in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3918320","3920320"," We catch a bit around 4 a.m"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3921200","3927520"," And by 11 a.m. We're up. We're up pretty big and that's every every year every year. It's the same"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3929840","3934480"," So if we had opened if we had opened futures yesterday green that would have been an issue"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3935120","3939600"," And the only issue I'm seeing this morning is the bid in the market was a little bit late"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3940240","3942240"," It should have started earlier this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3942240","3944240"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3945760","3949120"," Elon has done selling stock for the year I've missed some of the live stream"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3949120","3954960"," But there's a concrete cause for this some news or something or just the market makers killing options"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3955040","3958160"," Okay, so I'll start one last time just to rehash"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3960560","3962560"," Well, let me see if I can get in here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3962720","3965680"," I'll start this morning just to rehash for you. So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3966480","3967440"," Uh"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3967440","3974240"," Just the heads up. I know I make a lot of posts about the santa rally. I'm ribbing people trying to piss some people off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3974880","3977440"," But uh santa rally doesn't doesn't begin until"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3978320","3980320"," after the 25th"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3980320","3982320"," So just be aware of that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3982720","3984560"," The weakest day"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3984560","3989200"," After opx is typically the monday following opx"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3990080","3993520"," Now if you were to go back in history and look at mondays of opx"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3993680","3996240"," We usually sell off in the overnight pretty steeply"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","3996880","4000640"," But there's the bid comes straight back in the into the market at 4am"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4001200","4004880"," We didn't get that reaction this morning at 4am like we should have"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4005440","4008960"," But we have gotten a bid this morning once we hit 930"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4010640","4014480"," I will i'm going to turn off this this book map at this point and just"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4015280","4017120"," Show you guys that are just joining us"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4018000","4021200"," What i'm talking about so you know that we have buyers at 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4021600","4024480"," You know we have buyers at 450. That's where the smart money is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4025040","4028480"," You know that the first level of sellers is at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4029120","4031360"," And I also want to show you where the ice is above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4032880","4037600"," See up here at 470. This would be a hard no-go for you if you were our bull"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4038880","4040880"," There's 470 level up here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4042240","4045760"," So let's say we break through it. So anyways, if you're going to take a head a hedge"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4046240","4051040"," Or take another short. I am going to take another short or short at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4052720","4054720"," This is where i'm looking to go short once more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4056240","4060800"," I'm going to turn book map off for you or here at here so that you can see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4060800","4075760"," I'm using the chrome"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4080160","4082160"," Trading view"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4085920","4087920"," Let's look at yes"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4090800","4092800"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4101120","4108080"," Had to turn all this stuff off earlier so get book map for you guys it runs that it runs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4115120","4119680"," Okay, so you guys want to see stuff like this you see this volume this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4121280","4123680"," This volume was so low heading into the open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4126000","4128000"," Let me see here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4132720","4135440"," And you can see this took place this morning at 415"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4136400","4142640"," There was a firm rejection here and now you've got this battle between buyers and sellers taking place"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4146640","4148640"," Hi kitty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4149520","4152160"," And this is on a 15-minute delay, so"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4153440","4158480"," I don't I don't pay for data on trading view. I already pay for it on bookmark bookmark"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4158480","4160480"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4174480","4179520"," Yeah at discord saying that those call spreads are still on for the week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4180160","4182960"," Those four six five zeros and the forty seven hundreds"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4183760","4185920"," So it no one's become bearish yet"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4186720","4189440"," It's probably a better one to be looking at here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4191440","4194720"," And you can see the bid coming in you can see this doji candle here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4195120","4198720"," This is an exhaustion candle if you know you guys know what an exhaustion candle is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4199600","4202400"," This is showing the bears having some exhaustion this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4203600","4207600"," At the moment, so this is if you're just joining us. This is what you need to know, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4208640","4210640"," When we sold below here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4210640","4213680"," Uh, this yellow line right here or no this white line"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4214640","4222480"," Uh, this flips us to to a negative gamma. This is positive gamma here. This is negative gamma here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4223760","4229600"," And so what you're going to be looking for today is a retest below from previous lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4230240","4232240"," you want to be looking for"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4233760","4235760"," A retest down here at 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4236400","4238720"," 448 call it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4238720","4243520"," 44882 in the cash market you do want to see us retest this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4244400","4248480"," And if we break through so we can head lower and turn full bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4249120","4254000"," If we retest this 450 448 this morning and we are rejected"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4254480","4259280"," That's just like we did above here. So when you see above here, we took this look above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4259840","4262880"," And we weren't able to break above we just immediately sold off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4263680","4267360"," So the same thing should prove prove out this morning down below here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4267760","4269760"," You're either going to see a hard rejection"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4270720","4272160"," When we look below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4272160","4279120"," Or you're going to see us break through or leave even if we let's say we touched down here at 450 or 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4280080","4287040"," We bounced back up to 460 where rejected and we head lower even even if we do this move here today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4287920","4293840"," Uh, you want to be able to put your bear hat on fully and you can't right now. You can't put your bull hat on up here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4294320","4296320"," Excuse me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4297680","4301600"," I just woke up. I just say I just pounded some coffee and woke up. I need to blow my nose and"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4302480","4304800"," Do all that kind of stuff. But anyways down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4306000","4313680"," Because we're down here you want to see us test these lows. You don't want to see us moving higher this morning without testing lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4314640","4318800"," That's what you want. You would regardless of your a bull or a bear. That's what you want as a trainer"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4319200","4322960"," You want to see this retest down below because this will give you a resolution"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4323520","4325680"," to the downside or to the upside"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4326800","4330800"," Now there are we do have some from friday's opex"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4331360","4335280"," We still have lots of transactions taking place at this time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4335760","4339040"," So you get this grind on the open where we're trying to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4339840","4342000"," Get everybody positioned as to where they want to be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4342720","4348640"," And then we would move higher or lower. We do the retest down below or we or we come above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4349600","4353200"," To get rejected off for 60 now we are in negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4353520","4359920"," So you're going to expect negative volatility for at least a resolution over the course of one to three days"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4360640","4365120"," So if I were to give you like a training area, I would say 460 is probably the high"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4365600","4370800"," Until we test below at this 448 93. We want to see this test below at some point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4371840","4375440"," My I did have some hedging on that didn't do quite well today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4376400","4377760"," so my"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4377760","4381680"," Thought process is that we go back up to this 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4382240","4385440"," You reload and you try to take us down to retest"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4386080","4390960"," This 448 number that would be my my my thought process for this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4392240","4400640"," Nq is looking Nq just squeezed and spiked it had a I thought it would or I think it should go down at some point to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4402880","4404880"," For sick to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4404880","4406880"," 15 we'll take a look at nq now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4412000","4417280"," Because the volume profile and nq look at that nastiness that is just pure nasty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4419440","4421440"," It's wild"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4421440","4429760"," So you see this break below nq down here and it has and it's easily easily can fall down to this 15 100"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4430720","4434880"," Easily there's there's no node here. There's a small node at 4 to 15 4"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4435600","4437600"," But and we're squeezing right now"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","4449440","4453120"," It's probably weaker than even small caps"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4455600","4458720"," So if there was a weakness to spot or to the market this to this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4460240","4462240"," It's going to be nq"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4463280","4465280"," But it is squeezing too"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","4497760","4502560"," Involved in a trade. This is this was the time to wrap up a trade or possibly take a"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","4590320","4592320"," and"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4595120","4598480"," This is starting starting to form you can really start to see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4599520","4603600"," A picture for the day forming right now. This is a much better picture than we had"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4604640","4606640"," Earlier this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4606960","4609440"," I bring this a little bit tighter for you so you can see this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4610560","4614160"," And you can see the buyers are winning just heads up if you're a bear out there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4615360","4617360"," This is real time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4617360","4618480"," Data"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4618480","4622000"," Market data. This is almost as good as owning a"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4623680","4625680"," Bloomberg terminal"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4626000","4628000"," This is this is the next best thing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4628880","4632880"," Between this and all the other program crap that I run it's pretty much as good as it is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4634320","4636960"," Want you all out there to understand right now that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4638640","4640640"," The buyers have stepped in okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4641520","4644320"," You can see it down below here on the right bottom right hand side"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4644960","4651040"," You've got 25 percent more now it's yeah, you know you got 25 percent more of a bid in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4651760","4653760"," From buyers than you do in sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4655120","4657120"," You can see the sellers being absorbed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4659200","4661200"," The first cell area"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4665520","4667520"," Let's see where the first ice area is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4675280","4677280"," And you can see it right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4679680","4681840"," See this right here this big white line up here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4681840","4688480"," This is your first new resistance and just so you know all of the support. This is a key information you all need to know"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4689920","4695360"," All of the support and resistances have reset this morning being a negative gamma territory"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4695920","4702640"," So anyone giving you support resistance zones out there. They're probably not completely accurate at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4703360","4706240"," The biggest thing that you need to know this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4707360","4712160"," Is that the top right now is four six zero zero"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4713040","4717600"," And that the bottom right now is four five zero, okay?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4718240","4725760"," So you want to be buying on weakness down at four fifty four fifty four fifty two"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4727440","4730000"," And you want to be selling at four sixty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4730960","4733280"," That's that's what this book map is showing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4734560","4739280"," The liquidity has not left the market in and the supply is at four sixty right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4740960","4744000"," And the buyers the sellers are being absorbed as well"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4744960","4746960"," There could be a flip at any points, but"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4747680","4750320"," That that's where we are and we are in negative territory"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4750320","4756720"," So that would mean that instead of that four seventy being the top four sixty is now top that puts us"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4757360","4758320"," a"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4758320","4759760"," Down lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4759760","4761760"," in terms of"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4761760","4767680"," Or that that puts us into a volatile volatile territory and means that we're looking for a resolution"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4769280","4773280"," So that would mean we're looking to read or to retest four forty eight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4776880","4782240"," And if we don't breach four forty eight or four eight has a four four eight zero if you don't breach"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4783200","4785440"," four four eight zero"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4785440","4789520"," Then the move will be higher than four sixty it would it would move to four seventy again"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4790240","4793680"," To all-time highs and to be honest with you all out there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4794240","4799840"," You you have to understand with that. We had just had an all-time high. We were 150 points away from an all-time high"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4802000","4804320"," And we had the structure hasn't changed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4805680","4808240"," For a bullish outlook it's changed to a retest"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4808560","4813120"," Of previous lows now if we break those previous lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4814640","4816640"," I'm going to go full bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4817920","4820720"," So i'll be buying some so if we hit this for 60 today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4821280","4825280"," I will put more than a hedge on because we're in negative gamma territory"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4825920","4828800"," I'm going to be looking for that retest down below at four forty eight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4830320","4833280"," Ndx or the nasdaq looks very weak today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4834240","4837360"," You do know that we will have to grind through our ty"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4838240","4843680"," There's just so much money so many hedge funds and funds and mutual funds all kinds of crap"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4845040","4849360"," Or inside uh the ruts that unless the entire market went short today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4850160","4853120"," You wouldn't you wouldn't see us crash. I don't see a crash right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4853680","4858640"," Even if it we could sell down the market and to march at this point for where we are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","4859280","4862960"," But there's a bid coming in there's a bid coming in right now on spy calls"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","5086160","5088720"," There there was not much money to be made over the weekend"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5089280","5092640"," Unless you were if you were in futures there was money to be made"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5092880","5096240"," But there was no money to be made on on options. I can prove that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5105280","5109680"," Let me take a look and see me look at my calls right here. See if they're getting any premium in them"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","5144560","5150560"," I closed my my fd puts for a slight gain. They weren't matt. That's the thing that's hard about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5151360","5153360"," uh puts is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5154560","5160400"," They don't pay man. They don't pay that well. They pay but they don't pay like fd calls pay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5161120","5163120"," No shape no way shape or form"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5163760","5166400"," Maybe this is making it look a little bit better for you guys to see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5167360","5173840"," You see that the smart money is down here. You can also see another band device down here at 442"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5175520","5179200"," This is another bi-zone down below, but the red and the yellow here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5179600","5186320"," This is showing you where the heavy volume is coming in for calls and you can see above here at 460 new resistance"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5186720","5188720"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5188720","5193120"," If you were going to take short today, I'll be taking a short today to see another wall"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5193760","5196400"," So here's some new resistance lines for you guys and supports"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5197840","5201600"," 469 470 this is going to be a call wall above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5202400","5207200"," This is going to be heavy resistance here at 460 this shows a reversal"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5208320","5210480"," from positive to negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5212480","5214480"," You would see this yellow line above here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5215360","5217360"," But because you're seeing it at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5218720","5224720"," You're going to be looking for a rejection off 460 and then a retest of 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5225360","5228080"," Down below here. You want to see this 448 get broken"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5229840","5235760"," If 448 448 gets broken your next two levels below make sure you guys are taking notes on this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5236320","5238880"," Because this is important nobody else has these are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5239680","5242080"," Any levels that are out there are trashed at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5242880","5248080"," You're going to be looking for the next support level at 442 50 or so"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5248480","5254160"," The call 443 and then you're one book just below that is going to be 438 439"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5255280","5258320"," So if you take this short up here at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5258800","5262160"," You're definitely going to be looking for your first resistance at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5262800","5269280"," 452 then 450 then 442 443 and then 439"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5270240","5273520"," You guys got all that I'll list them from the top to the bottom"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5275920","5277920"," Ready"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5278160","5280160"," Call wall 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5281600","5283920"," First major resistance 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5286000","5291840"," Your new volatility trigger is going to be roughly 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5292960","5294960"," to 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5295920","5299760"," And then below that your supports are going to be at 442"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5300240","5303440"," 443ish somewhere in there and then 438"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5306480","5308480"," And you should you should put those on your charts"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5309360","5313920"," On the spy so you have some reference on where to go long and short"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5315760","5318720"," And because because we flipped from positive gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5319200","5322480"," Normally this yellow line would be down here for a bounce"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5323120","5325440"," Now you've got the bounce on the top here, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5326080","5328720"," So that's showing that showing you that we're in negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5329200","5334720"," You're going to be looking for us to hit 460 reject and come lower and start testing new lows"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5335680","5342640"," You want to see us break through 448 today if we or or this week if we don't break through 448 this week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5344000","5348400"," That will be the same look as we had above at 470 earlier in the week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5349760","5351760"," Excuse me earlier in last week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5352480","5354480"," And so that would mean we look below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5356080","5358080"," And we had higher once more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5358720","5362560"," And note that if we don't break below 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5363280","5368720"," The new the new look above would be higher than 470 it would be something stupid"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5369360","5371920"," Like for off take a look and see what what it would be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5373520","5375520"," But you would then be looking for"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5376800","5378800"," Let me take a look here. I'll tell you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5379680","5382080"," You would then be looking for"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5383840","5385840"," It's something crazy too"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5386480","5391120"," If 448 gets rejected, let's say yeah, so hold on a second here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5395200","5398880"," I don't know what's up with this. I've got this one. I've got a really sticky"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5400320","5402800"," On this other laptop. I've got this really sticky"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5409200","5411200"," Something on my controls here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5415040","5417280"," Yeah, you'd be looking for something stupid like"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5419840","5422800"," The call wall would move so if we reject off 480"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5424000","5427040"," Excuse me 448. Let's say we reject off 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5428560","5433760"," You would then swing all the way high to look above and that number would be 480"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5434480","5436480"," 478"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5437680","5439680"," 478 to 480"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5439680","5441680"," Would be somewhere in there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5441760","5445680"," That's how crazy and wild the market can become with the moves that we're making"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5447120","5449120"," Do you guys all understand these concepts"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5452960","5454960"," Yeah, I got the book map up for you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5454960","5456960"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5460320","5464400"," Got the book map up for you this morning. So some key levels one last time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5466240","5471440"," So let's start at the beginning. So we flipped from positive to negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5472560","5474560"," in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5474560","5480720"," Or let's start at the beginning beginning so every year on the on the sunday monday of december opex"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5481120","5484320"," We are very weak in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5486960","5491840"," Though a bid comes in the market immediately at 4am and usually sends us screaming higher"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5492640","5497520"," 100 points is not off the table 70 to 100 points in previous years"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5498400","5503360"," So today to see 100 or 150 points is on the table from from previous"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5504480","5505600"," History"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5505600","5509760"," We did not though we though we did not get the reaction that I expected at 4am"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5509840","5511840"," It was weaker than expected"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5512720","5517280"," Some of this is probably carry over from not having enough runway on friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5517840","5521600"," For sellers and buyers to come to an agreement on price"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5523040","5528000"," That leads to the selling down in the overnight in a low liquidity environment"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5528000","5533200"," We I think we traded something like 20 or 60,000 shares that dropped us down to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5534080","5536080"," this gamma flip"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5536560","5541360"," So it's like a little bit of a sabotage moment, right? So you end up trading down this morning into the open"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5542480","5549520"," We broke through the gamma flip and the the support that you the critical support at 4550"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5550560","5552560"," Slammed down into 4500"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5553920","5559760"," The bell of course we hit the bell and liquidity comes in right from the buy side"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5560960","5562960"," Immediately rejects"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5563200","5565200"," Heading any lower to pretest 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5566240","5570240"," So that it shows in the options chain this morning the puts"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5570800","5573680"," Heading into this morning for expiry today. We're destroyed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5574880","5576880"," They're not destroyed, but they didn't print heavy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5577520","5579920"," And right now you're seeing consolidation"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5580480","5585760"," You can see it here on book map that the buyers have stepped in at 450 and 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5586480","5592560"," Now though they have stepped in it hasn't resolved to positive gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5593040","5597200"," We now have resistance that has been put in place at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5597920","5599920"," So that's a problem"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5600080","5602080"," So what does that mean? It means that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5603120","5607920"," We have a river of liquidity here. You've got buyers that want to take us up to 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5608560","5612480"," It'll reject bears will go short at that point if I was a bull"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5612480","5617360"," I would go short at that point as well because we're a negative gamma. We've we flipped our gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5618000","5622720"," Uh, and we're going to attempt at some point in the next I would say the next three days"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5623760","5626480"," We will attempt to retest 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5627760","5629280"," Down below here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5629280","5631440"," And if we can break through 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5632480","5635040"," You're going to be looking for price targets of 442"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5635520","5636880"," 443"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5636880","5640080"," And then below that 438 to 439 now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5641360","5643360"," With that all being said"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5644400","5646960"," If we are not able to retest and break through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5647600","5649360"," 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5649360","5651360"," The next stop is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5651840","5653840"," Stupid high it's like 478"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5654880","5660320"," 480 that would be the that would be the next stop you would blow right past this 470 above here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5661680","5663440"," Because you've looked below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5663440","5666240"," Again for a third time below 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5666800","5671040"," And you've been rejected. It would be the same way on the top too. If you're heading higher"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5671440","5674880"," We've already rejected twice on the highs. I believe believe it's twice"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5675520","5679040"," We've rejected. I'll take a look here. Yeah, we've rejected twice"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5679520","5685040"," Three times I guess our first all-time high we rejected but then the real true test we had one"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5686080","5687360"," And then two"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5687360","5692800"," So you would then again go to this next high and it'll only expand as time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5693520","5696800"," Uh moves forward or we find resolution you want to see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5697600","5701760"," Major support be broken if you can't get that major support"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5702320","5704720"," Uh broken then of course you had higher"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5704720","5706720"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5708240","5712800"," So this is all grind in here. You can see this right this is all in all the continuation"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5713440","5715280"," Of friday opx"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5715280","5719040"," You can see it right here. It's just this it's massive massive flow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5719760","5724160"," Uh from both sellers and buyers. I'll show you guys this one more thing down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5724560","5726560"," Just so you guys can have a look see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5727120","5732080"," Uh, you can see that the buyers are winning so anyone telling you out there that the that the sellers are winning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5732640","5734640"," Uh, this this disproves that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5734960","5738000"," This is as good as anything that a hedge fund has"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5739520","5742560"," Like the when you look at the computing power that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5743280","5745680"," Hedge funds have this the book book map is just as good"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5747200","5749200"," It's same stuff the professionals use"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5749840","5754720"," And uh, it's it's kind of equal right now 207 buys to 194 sells"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5755440","5759360"," It was lopsided more on the buy side earlier. It's starting to chill out a little bit"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5762080","5768800"," It's not showing out at all. We're up to 2 million buys. That's not 200,000. That's 2.0. That's 2.08"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5770960","5776080"," A million then we got 1.95 sellers. So the volume is actually increasing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5781760","5787360"," And you'll see some resolution here by if I had to pick a side, I would say that we go back up to 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5788000","5791760"," We reject we try to slam down that 448 once more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5793440","5797840"," We are definitely in in bearish context, but we are not in bear country yet"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5798400","5801840"," You have to get below 448 to get into bear country"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5803920","5806720"," Does that work for any of you out there? Is this helping at all or no?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5806720","5808720"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5816000","5822560"," Just need to understand this confidence in 460 lol, okay, so let me show it to you in a better. Let me explain this better to you guys, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5826240","5828080"," Let me explain this slightly better to you guys"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5829280","5830640"," so"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5830640","5833760"," Down below here see this red this red bar right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5833840","5838240"," You see all this right here see all this white right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5839680","5843040"," This is where all the liquidity is for buyers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5844160","5850160"," Sometimes this red bar and this white down here is lower. It'll be down here somewhere, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5851440","5855760"," Sometimes it's higher close to the limit bid and ask, okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5857920","5862160"," Sometimes it's down here and sometimes it's up here. Does that make sense?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5862880","5867120"," So if this red and this white is lower and this is all dark blue"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5867920","5872400"," In here it means that we're trading much higher than where the real money is right"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5874080","5878560"," Well right now that river of liquidity and buyers is right at the bid ask"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5879600","5881600"," Okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5882400","5884400"," And as they're buying this market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5885280","5890560"," This is where the sellers are above okay. They're up here at 460 does that make sense"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5892160","5894720"," If you were to see this yellow bar swoop down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5896480","5903120"," That would imply that the sellers are you you would see this cascading of put flow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5903680","5906560"," You would see this red right here become a sea of red"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5908080","5911280"," You would see the sellers start to absorb the buyers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5911760","5919200"," You would see this this red and yellow line swoop down even lower so that they don't catch the falling knives of sellers above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5920000","5924960"," So right now how this map looks it's showing you that the buyers have stepped in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5925440","5928880"," It's showing you where the real sellers are that's above here at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5929360","5932080"," That means the banks are buying down here and they want to sell up here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5934400","5936400"," And if you see these little ice"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5936400","5940720"," You see this little blue line down here. See this little blue line down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5941200","5948000"," This is even deeper outside the money. This is where support lies below the market 442 438"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5948480","5950480"," And above here you see this 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5951120","5955520"," There are more sellers waiting above up here at 470. This is another higher wall"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5957760","5963040"," If you see all this red and yellow right here, this is major support in the market right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5978800","5985200"," Do you guys want to see the NASDAQ feed? I can show you that I can show the I can show the at in the NASDAQ feed if you want to see it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","5986800","5988800"," Hang tight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6008800","6010800"," You"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6015760","6017760"," Give it just a minute for it to load in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6022400","6024400"," It's gonna take a minute"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6032480","6034480"," Sketchy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6038880","6041920"," Yeah, so my puts this morning were dog shit"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6042880","6046560"," I put my puts were up. Do you want to see some craziness right now?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6046560","6052640"," You guys are saying you guys are telling me that NQ is going down. Oh, no, no, it isn't"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6055040","6057040"," No, it isn't"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6059440","6062000"," This is the foam. Oh, we want to see some foam balls"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6062400","6069040"," You see this right here you can see that the bulls are destroying the bears right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6071760","6073920"," Let's get this a little bit tighter here so you can see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6076880","6078880"," Just firm it up for you here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6085280","6087280"," You've got a huge bit at 378"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6088560","6090560"," 37850"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6091280","6098160"," You've got a new a new ceiling on NASDAQ though at 381. So this is actually pretty this is a much tighter range"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6099040","6103200"," See how the see how the buyers are lower on on ndx"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6104240","6106880"," So that means that ndx has a bid"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6107520","6110720"," It also shows that their bid was at 378"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6111360","6113360"," You see this space in here right"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6114160","6116560"," It shows that ndx has gone up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6117040","6121680"," So let's say at the open this morning you would have bought down here at 378"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6122160","6124480"," And you're looking to sell now at 381"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6126640","6131040"," And as the morning wears on you'd be looking as a day trader. I'm looking"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6131760","6137360"," To buy 378 and sell 381 does that help any of you guys out there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6139920","6144960"," Yeah, so this this this this been the reason why the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6145520","6147920"," Stream is cutting it out is because of book map"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6149040","6151600"," It can sue it's a it's a live data feed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6158320","6160320"," I've got too much data running all at once"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6162400","6166400"," This isn't really intended for me to run at all is it is it helped at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6168960","6170960"," Can you guys hear my voice at least"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6174960","6181040"," It looks like"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6184240","6187520"," Yeah, you guys can't see the stream because it's consuming too much data"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6193680","6196240"," Let's see if this cuts if this kicks back in for you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6204960","6213200"," This thing consumes crazy crazy crazy crazy bandwidth"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6225120","6229040"," Yeah, good luck this morning. I'll I'll get I'll get back to you if I see anything different this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6229040","6231760"," I'll let you guys know, but you guys definitely have your levels"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6232480","6237120"," Yeah, on ndx you're looking for levels on 378 for a wall for right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6237760","6240000"," Let me bring it a little bit a little bit tighter"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6243680","6248400"," See if you can see where the levels are for ndx for you or for the cues"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6249680","6251680"," You've got support now at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6253600","6259920"," 378 380 375 and 370 on ndx"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6262560","6264560"," You do have sellers though above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6266240","6268240"," At 381 and 385"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6269440","6271920"," This makes ndx very squeezable"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6273600","6275440"," As we move forward"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6275440","6280640"," And i'm surprised that the number of buyers that have stepped up on the cues this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6282000","6287040"," It is the weakest looking of all three indexes, but buyers are seriously stepping in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6291760","6293760"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6297280","6299280"," Yeah, i'll trade vix i"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6299840","6302160"," I will go down the vix hole trading vix"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6303280","6306960"," But right now i'm only using it for i'm only using the vix right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6307040","6311280"," I really want to see I wanted to see that 24 27 gap get closed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6311840","6317040"," I know there are some bears out there that want to see the 40 there's one much higher i think it's in the 40s and 50s"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6318240","6320240"," to get closed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6320560","6325520"," I think if we retest 448 and head lower if we can break through 448 and head lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6325840","6330720"," You would see the higher gaps get filled, but I just don't see it at this moment this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6333680","6338560"," Yeah, we're moving up. I promise you guys are moving up this morning. I guarantee it. I'll not guarantee it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6338560","6340800"," I'll put it like a sick. I'll put like a 70 percent"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6341440","6346160"," 80 percent chance that we're gonna we're gonna try to head back to 460 at least"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6346880","6350080"," And you can see the bid. I don't at some point you should be able to see the bid"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6351040","6351920"," on this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6351920","6353520"," three"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6353520","6360240"," On ndx and we'll switch to the we'll switch to iWm here in just a second once you guys see this feed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6362160","6367360"," Matter of fact, I'll just switch right now. By the time you guys get this feed to your you'll see that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6367360","6382320"," I'm going to bring up here as iWm we're going to see how weak or strong it actually is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6397840","6401200"," Let's see what's going on with the iWm"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6418640","6422880"," Give it just a second here so it can calculate it's gonna take a minute"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6428320","6435440"," All right, so we have a bid a slight bid in iWm slight bid in the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6436560","6440720"," We are I would call it neutral on the on the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6445760","6449440"," Let's see if we can get some better support and resistance on the rut this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6450880","6452880"," Yeah, the rut's kind of a mess"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6457680","6459680"," The"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6460640","6463360"," The rut is just pure consolidation at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6464000","6468400"," And you would expect this on the right the rut's going to take some work to dump at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6468800","6473920"," We're at bottom right now on the rut 208 is the weakest you'll see on the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6475200","6476640"," It's not"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6476640","6481200"," The rut of all three indexes the rut is going to be the one where you'd have to you'd have to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6482000","6484000"," You'd have to keep it here for"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6484080","6485840"," probably a week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6485840","6490960"," To really do some damage to it. There's just so much money in the rut. It's insane"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6493120","6495680"," And the but the bear the sellers are winning on the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6496240","6499920"," But it's going to take a grind here. I would expect no movement on the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6500640","6502640"," uh for for at least the morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6503280","6505280"," slight slightly down by"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6505760","6507760"," By a couple ticks when that that's how"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6508960","6512160"," You can I don't know if you guys can see this or at some point you can see this but"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6516000","6522000"," You've got support down below here at 208 the range on the rut on iWm is super tight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6524000","6525600"," super tight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6525600","6529440"," 208 80 a training range of 208 80 to two"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6530800","6535360"," At the top 211 so this is all consolidation"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6542000","6544000"," Let's see if we can go even stretch it even out more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6546240","6548240"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6549760","6556720"," Yeah, it's yeah, this I don't see the rut falling anytime soon. You've got some firm support down here at 195"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6558320","6560320"," 200"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6561600","6567600"," And then you've got this area that we're in this is that that big big giant shelf being"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6568800","6570800"," Your call wall is at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6571600","6573360"," 240 245"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6573360","6577520"," 230 225 then right where we are 209"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6578800","6580880"," I don't see the I don't see the iW"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6581280","6587280"," I don't know what you guys look at but this is real-time data and where buyers and sellers are and i'm just not seeing it on the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6588640","6590640"," So i'm going to head back to the spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6591360","6594720"," Let's put this the you're talking some serious selling needs to happen"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6595920","6597920"," Serious ridiculous selling"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6604320","6606880"," Let's take a few moments for it to load up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6610480","6612720"," Like like it's hard to explain the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6613600","6618400"," The size of selling you would need to see in the rut really drop it big"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6619520","6624000"," That'd be massive. I mean even the rut up took how long did the run up take on this on the rut"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6625680","6627680"," Took something like"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6628960","6630960"," Look at the rut real quick"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6631440","6639200"," You figure the ramp on the rut took how long off top of head down you guys think it took took from march"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6642800","6646800"," It took from march of 2020 to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6648160","6652400"," January 26th of 2021 nine months"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6653280","6655840"," So do I think that the rut can slowly sell off?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6656640","6659840"," Sure, I think it takes until probably march"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6661200","6665360"," To really hammer it down. Well, no, you know what it could probably take to the end of January"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6666320","6672080"," To get it to the 176th level. That's something that's some serious. That's why I only trade the rut on weekly"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6672640","6675040"," It would take like a week. It would take at least a month"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6676560","6678560"," Month and a half"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6679520","6681520"," To really"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6681520","6683520"," Sell it down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6686320","6688320"," Let me see they cleaned this up for you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6690960","6692960"," And"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6694400","6696800"," You can see this start to shape up a little bit better"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6698720","6701200"," You can see the spy begin to shape up a little bit better"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6706880","6709200"," See if I can get this slightly better here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6711120","6716400"," And you'll now see down below here. This is that 452 buyers that I told you about earlier this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6716960","6720160"," You can now see a gap in between the 452 buyers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6720720","6724720"," And they're up at 453. We should head to that 460 level"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6726320","6729440"," So when you say you don't understand what we're doing what's happening here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6730080","6732480"," You can see that this should help you here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6733440","6737200"," 452 and 450 are acting as supports"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6742080","6745840"," And then you can see sellers at 460 and at 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6747280","6749280"," You can"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6749760","6754560"," Another thing that I want to show you here is that we are now starting to build some support in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6755760","6760880"," I don't know if you're going to see that retest of 448 right now. It's not looking like it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6763040","6766320"," It's not looking like it looking like a base is being built"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6768560","6770560"," Same thing hard target 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6771840","6776080"," Hard target 460 support at 452 450 is firming up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6777360","6779200"," 100%"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6779200","6785360"," I guess I'm not I guess if you saw a continued weakness in IWM, but you're talking about a grind that would take"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6786400","6788400"," Substantial time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6790400","6794160"," This isn't charting right so when you guys tell me things"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6794240","6796480"," I I like to see the charts all that kind of stuff"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6796480","6799440"," But when you're looking at real time what's really taking place"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6800160","6802160"," It kind of defeats"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6802320","6804320"," Everything that you've charted"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6804320","6806160"," it defeats"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6806160","6808160"," you know everything that uh"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6810080","6815040"," Defeats you know defeats any kind of theory that you have if you if you see the actual volume in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6815680","6817680"," the supply for sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6822560","6826160"," Defeats any oh and we do have some sellers coming into the spy whoo"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6827120","6829120"," We have"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6829120","6832000"," Strong sellers coming in at 86,000"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6832800","6838560"," And then we have uh buyers only at 67,000 this might be a good place to buy a dip"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6843760","6847920"," So you can see so right so if you guys can hear me out there right now right in lifetime"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6848640","6851520"," Where we are right now, I can see that we're about to dip"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6852720","6855440"," But the buyers just step back in again. Wow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6857280","6859600"," So I can see probably anywhere from five"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6860560","6866480"," Anywhere from let's call like 15 seconds to a minute ahead of the move that should take place"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6868080","6875040"," Um or the implied move well not always but a lot of the time 78 percent of the time you can see where"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6876000","6882720"," Uh the sellers are and if if they swoop in to just sell the market down you usually have some form of a lead time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6883920","6885920"," on that happening"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6890560","6892560"," Let's see if I can see what you guys are doing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6896240","6898640"," Yeah, native that's a native you've got it correct"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6899040","6902160"," I have a feeling that a lot of people haven't traded for many years"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6902800","6906480"," If I was talking about that at the beginning of the of the show is that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6907520","6909520"," You you always want to expect"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6910960","6916000"," uh the the month the sunday into monday of opex to be very very weak"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6916800","6919040"," And you expect a large bid to come in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6919840","6924000"," At four a.m. To clean up the what was happening on friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6924640","6928560"," friday's opex so you would see a huge bid come in on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6929600","6934560"," Uh friday on monday morning at four a.m. We didn't get the largest bid at four a.m"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6934880","6936480"," I expected more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6936480","6938480"," And we should be higher right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6938640","6941440"," Uh compare comparatively speaking to other years"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6941920","6948720"," We should be much much higher and we should finish the day on the high too. I have my my target is 460 this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6949520","6955360"," And that is historically accurate. This would be the first year that we haven't done that in many years"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6958720","6962560"," Yeah, I see biden sending us to the depths of hell absolutely"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6962960","6966000"," It all kind of lines up. Let's say we move up to 460 today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6966560","6969920"," And then we sell down to read I want to see that retest in 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6970640","6973360"," For sure. I'd like to see I'd like to see us hit 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6974000","6976000"," Grab short once more"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6976000","6980720"," Grab a grab yourself some shorts and some puts whatever you go. You can you can go long and puts"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6982000","6988640"," Go short. We're gonna look for I want to see that retest of 448 because that gives resolution to bears"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6989040","6991040"," if we were able to break through 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6991680","6994880"," That gives the resolution to bears to look for much lower numbers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","6996080","7002400"," And it also gives resolve to bulls if you can't break through to head to all-time highs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7002960","7004960"," It'll resolve to one way or the other"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7005440","7007440"," And we also have some"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7007680","7014400"," Some volatile news heading into wednesday as well with the fed be it on vacation. You can probably manipulate"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7015040","7017040"," bad numbers on wednesday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7018160","7021920"," Uh for some more downside into friday. I thought we'd be higher today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7022560","7026960"," My my I thought was that we'd have the high today when my thought wasn't have the low in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7027520","7030560"," And then we get the the bid in the market in the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7031440","7033280"," And hit 470"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7033360","7041200"," Today that would be the sailing then we would sell down to uh, we would sell down to 448 heading into friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7042960","7046720"," Uh, and then we would make new all-time high new all-time highs next week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7047840","7049840"," after christmas"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7050160","7053520"," But right now now our ceiling is not 470. It's 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7054400","7056400"," Or it's it's our first"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7056400","7058400"," area of big volatility"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7059360","7063040"," It's close to what I thought would happen, but it's not as expected"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7063840","7067360"," And to be quite frank if we went down to 448 today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7068560","7071280"," You could see 478 by tomorrow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7072080","7073680"," If it didn't break"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7073680","7076800"," You could see 150 point swing in one day"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7077600","7079600"," Which is pretty wild"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7080560","7082560"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7086000","7089360"," Yeah, so uh, envesqua has this right so"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7090480","7095680"," The ruts not moving down no matter what you think the ruts not moving down it might slowly grind down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7096480","7099840"," Until liquidity comes into the rut, but you have to understand how big"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7100720","7106320"," That wall is on the rut where we are right now. It took it took a year"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7107280","7112960"," It took almost a year it took nine months to to put the rut where it was"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7113680","7117040"," So you're you're maybe you'd see it grind down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7118480","7121280"," In the course of a one to three months to drop the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7121920","7126160"," It would be what makes a slow roll over take place in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7126880","7130960"," You're not good. You're just not gonna you would you'd have to see for something like that would be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7132240","7135600"," Unheard of that kind of selling it would have to be like a covid event"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7136160","7137520"," Let it out"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7137520","7139680"," And it is what's holding us up from going lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7140240","7144000"," Even though it's going down, but it it it just takes time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7144880","7146880"," It takes time"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7148560","7152800"," No, there's no there's no interesting low of the day. Yeah. Well, maybe on the long side"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7157520","7161920"," Maybe on the long side and you're seeing this firm up right now. Can you guys see this firm up right now?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7162880","7169040"," so 450 is firming up as as buyers 452 is buyers and"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7170400","7172400"," That's the cell zone is 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7176720","7178720"," And unless the buyers disappear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7179600","7182800"," You will see resolution to 468 some point today or you should"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7184320","7186320"," Theoretically"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7188000","7190000"," Yeah flow is king"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7190400","7194160"," Flow is king over flows king over anything"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7195840","7197840"," Anything there is nothing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7198000","7204880"," That beats lifetime flow nothing nothing. I don't care what anyone says. You can you can chart me whatever you want to chart me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7206480","7208480"," Flow is king period"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7208720","7215120"," There's nothing out there that's going to explain explain what's happening right now better than them watching lifetime flow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7215120","7223920"," I'm looking for her to come to me at 453 short to their"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7224720","7227120"," Look to yeah, you want to be if you're a bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7228080","7230080"," Well, first of all, we're a negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7230400","7236560"," So we shouldn't we should be we should be shorting every rip at this point until we get resolution down at 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7237280","7240480"," But if you're a bear you want to be looking above here, you can see it right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7241360","7243360"," You can I can show it to you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7244000","7248000"," This is where you want to be taking your shorts. This is where every professional bear"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7248560","7251600"," Out there is looking to go short 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7252880","7255120"," guaranteed 100 percent guaranteed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7256080","7259920"," The only bears trying to go short here down here are retail bears"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7262880","7268800"," But all of all the professionals are more than likely looking for 460 today to short or or whenever it resolves"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7269600","7272720"," And there it could be that too. That's the other that's that would be plan b"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7272720","7276800"," And that would be that we resolve to the downside that the buyers leave the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7277280","7281840"," But you would also see this red line right here. You would see this red line dip lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7283200","7285200"," Get lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7288480","7290480"," The bubbles show the size"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7291440","7295760"," Great question the bubbles show the size of buyers and sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7296560","7298560"," So it shows the the lot size"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7299120","7303440"," How many lot am I buying a thousand shares or a hundred thousand shares?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7303920","7305760"," So the smaller the bubble"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7305760","7308320"," The small the smaller the sellers are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7308960","7316080"," So from this you can deduce that there are large buyers coming into the market and absorbing smaller sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7321440","7323440"," Great question"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7323760","7328640"," What's the narrative to get the market up all bad narrative and finally people waking up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7329200","7331760"," No, there's no real narrative what it looks like to me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7332080","7336080"," You could look at the news as it came out yesterday if it was my suspicion"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7336800","7339520"," Is that i've got two suspicions the first one is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7340320","7343840"," That jpm is trying to squeeze the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7344560","7348560"," And that gs is not out of their shorts yet"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7349520","7354000"," They haven't closed their short positions or whatever put structures"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7354000","7360480"," They have if they've got some some fly puts or some put some some barefoot or some barefoot flies out there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7360800","7362800"," They haven't closed them yet"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7362800","7367760"," My my assumption is that mansion gets paid off that people in congress the president"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7368240","7373280"," You don't I know you guys some of you guys don't believe this but you tie it all together with this this story that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7374240","7376240"," GDP is not going to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7376720","7377920"," Um"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7377920","7382800"," That gdp is going down that the bb b is not going to pass you pull mansion on board"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7383520","7385520"," You tie together kovid"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7385520","7392960"," And the president speaking on tuesday and you've got a story to be negative in the market or an excuse for the market to be negative"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7393360","7397280"," If you paid attention closely to what gs said"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7398400","7404320"," Over on sunday night at nine p.m. They left the door open for gdp going up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7405200","7407200"," into"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7407200","7408640"," the first quarter"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7408640","7414080"," Which makes me believe that the moment they close their short positions or bare positions"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7414640","7418640"," You'll see gs come out and say hey by the way gdp is going to be"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7419680","7421680"," 3.3 percent or whatever"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7421680","7425920"," And we're gonna all we're all we're all long and by the way, so you should have been long as well"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7425920","7427920"," Uh"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7433200","7436320"," Yeah, if you're a bear it's all about position if you're a bull it's all about position"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7437280","7442720"," So be conscious of that this morning. You can see down on the right hand side of the barzer and control the market right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7443360","7448560"," There's nothing saying that the bears are in control of the of the live market right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7449280","7451280"," um"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7451280","7455120"," But the supports and resistance have changed have you guys all heard my"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7455280","7459040"," Give you me give you the um the support the new support and resistances"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7459840","7462160"," You guys all know that we have flipped to negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7463280","7465680"," You know that resistance is now at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7466560","7468560"," You should know that 452"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7470080","7477280"," To 450 is where the body could also know that we want to see a retest of 448 for resolution to the downside"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7480960","7482480"," To"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7482720","7484720"," 442"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7484720","7486480"," 443"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7486480","7488480"," and as low as"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7495360","7497120"," Uh 440"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7497120","7499200"," 439 to 440"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7499200","7503520"," So your first two stops would be 442 and then 449"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7503920","7505280"," 440"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7505280","7511120"," You can see above here. We've got a call wall at 470 and again higher at 475"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7511680","7514800"," I do all want you all to realize out there that if"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7516160","7518640"," If we do not break through 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7519600","7523920"," And a base is built down below here and it is not broken through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7524320","7526960"," You will see the same wild swing to the upside"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7527520","7534240"," and the 460 cell wall will disappear and you will then see uh swing to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7535200","7540400"," 150 points you'd see like maybe 478 480 within a day or two"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7541360","7544800"," Just like this swing down you'd see something really nasty on the swing high"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7548480","7550480"," Seeing nothing but a grind lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7550560","7554080"," Yeah, Tim uh, no, sorry buddy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7556400","7558400"," Sorry"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7558880","7560880"," That's not what you're seeing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7562000","7567840"," Uh, so anyways, that's what the that's what the plan is for today. I'm going to log off here at some point look for the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7568240","7569760"," the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7569760","7571920"," Look for an attempt for 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7572240","7576560"," If you're a bear you want to reenter shorts once more for or just below 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7577040","7582160"," And then swing them down to 448 for another attempt to uh breach 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7584320","7586320"," You guys all got that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7591200","7594720"," Any more questions before I before I sign off at this at this point"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7597840","7599840"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7603120","7607920"," I'm looking at the flow right now. Let me take a look at the flow again for you guys chases asking about flow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7608720","7610720"," I will take a look"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7617600","7621920"," Yeah, we have some negative flow in the spy for sure. We've got positive flow in tesla"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7623200","7624560"," uber"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7624560","7626560"," Facebook neo"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7628640","7630640"," We"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7630640","7635200"," We've got it's negative flow though on the spy apple"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7638880","7645440"," And the q's amc some negative flow, but it's not it's not really that big enough to be seeing yet"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7649040","7656240"," The negative flow on spy is for uh 121 at 433p"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7657840","7662320"," And the rest of it's all noise"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7665040","7667600"," It's more 1224 50p"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7668640","7670640"," But that stuff came in early this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7671840","7674800"," That stuff's gone all that's all that was burned"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7677280","7682480"," All that flow is burned so you're looking more if it was me I would say wait for 460 and then take a"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7682960","7686000"," Take a put position of 121 433"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7688640","7693360"," That's that that's the uh put position I would be taking it for 460 today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7695200","7697200"," Because nothing's showing us going down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7703440","7705440"," Where would you short the vix cap"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7706560","7710160"," I haven't had a little chance to look at the vix this morning yet. I've got everything"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7710160","7714000"," I've got running right now is to live stream to you guys. Let's take a take a minute"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7714960","7720240"," Uh, no book that's not too hard. It's just expensive. It costs stupid money"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7720240","7723440"," It costs me like almost close to four to five hundred bucks a month"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7724240","7726400"," It's ridiculously it's ridiculously expensive"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7728000","7732720"," It's not that hard to set up in matter of fact, I still have to set up a hero indicator"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7733360","7736880"," For I don't know if I can put here. I don't think I can put the hero indicator"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7737520","7739520"," on the uh dx feed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7740240","7744640"," On the data feed for cash market it works it works on the futures feed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7745360","7747360"," but not the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7747760","7749360"," the"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7749360","7751360"," cash feed"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7758080","7762640"," And I use a basic gdp was already going down now they care about covid"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7763520","7769360"," You know, it's just it the the news is used to dump the market and bring the market back up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7770240","7775360"," I don't believe any of the news I read. I just read it as to where wherever we are in the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7775760","7780640"," I don't believe positive news either. I don't I don't believe any of it as a matter of fact"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7780640","7783360"," I usually trade better not watching the news"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7784800","7786800"," by using"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7787040","7790880"," Volatility by using traditional charting"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7792080","7794080"," by using"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7794080","7796080"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7796080","7801360"," Do use the news somewhat more of more of a when we hit a hard resistance or a hard support"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7801360","7805920"," I'll look to see what the context of the news is. So yeah, I do use the news"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7808560","7812720"," I use I use volume profile and that mix as well. So volume profile"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7815040","7818960"," Market profile I couple that with volatility"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7820640","7822960"," Gamavana Volga all that stuff"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7824400","7827280"," Then I use lifetime flow lifetime order flow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7828320","7830320"," on the markets both"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7830400","7832400"," options and"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7833120","7834640"," share"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7834640","7836640"," order flow"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7837440","7842480"," Yeah, it's not so hard taking a break you you know a lot a lot of the a lot of you guys"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7842480","7845280"," Or not a lot of you guys, but I don't think a lot of you guys understand that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7845760","7850480"," It would be nothing to see a swing to 478 in the next couple days or this week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7851440","7855600"," Would it wouldn't it wouldn't phase me at all to see that it wouldn't be shocked"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7856960","7859760"," And you've got a base right now being built here at 450"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7860560","7864480"," Today, so let's say let's say it wouldn't shock me to see us"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7864800","7871680"," All right, so the most probable outcome for today into the rest of the week as we are right now would be that"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7872560","7874560"," We trade up to 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7875360","7880320"," Then we trade down from 460 into Biden weakness on Tuesday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7881680","7886160"," Continued weakness on Wednesday with the economic calendar that we have"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7888160","7892480"," Let's say we trade down and start testing that 448 and just start grinding"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7893120","7897840"," That would either prove us to enter a bearish context bear country you could call it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7898400","7900400"," And if we don't break that 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7901360","7903360"," Let's say it leads into Friday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7904000","7906000"," Then you can see into Monday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7906960","7912960"," Us down at 448 and swing up to 478. I don't know you don't believe that, but that could happen easily"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7914000","7916000"," easily"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7916720","7919200"," And then we could even sell off into the new year"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7920720","7927360"," Back down to let's say call you could call it 460 would then be become support you can trade all the way down to 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7928240","7932800"," And then after the new year into January trade up to the 480s 490s"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7933600","7937840"," That's looking forward, but if that's that would be the bullish side on the bearish side"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7938320","7941920"," If you were able to break through 448, you would see into January"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7942880","7947120"," 439 430 433 432 somewhere down there"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7948480","7950240"," That shows both"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7950240","7954960"," That shows the wildness of where we are in the market the extreme how extreme this market can become"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7955760","7957760"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7959280","7963200"," Would I would short for 460 and buy 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7964080","7965200"," Lower"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7965200","7967920"," You want to see that test on 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7968960","7972160"," Or a breakthrough 448 if you buy 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7972640","7976160"," You want to buy put hedges to protect in case we fall through"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7980640","7982160"," That's all this is showing"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7982160","7985200"," And you can see this you can see this base forming up right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7985840","7987280"," Let me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7987280","7989440"," You can see this base actually start to form up"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7990560","7991920"," If that helps"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7991920","7994080"," You can see the ice down here at 440"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7994960","7997440"," This is starting to firm up down here 440"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","7998000","8002320"," That's you're even getting consolidation between that 438 and 442"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8002800","8006560"," It's now becoming 439 is going to going to form up into some hard support"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8007120","8011520"," You can see 460 up here. You can see 470 up here. You can see 475"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8012560","8014960"," But it's higher I guarantee it's like 478"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8019600","8025200"," Yeah, this is all clear skies actually so if you broke through 480 it's it's clear skies above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8025920","8027920"," So things could get pretty wild"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8032720","8035840"," The only thing you should be focusing on today into the next couple days"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8036480","8038480"," Is"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8038960","8044400"," Is looking for this touch on 460 because all these buyers that are buying this market this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8045920","8047920"," They're looking for profit at 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8049040","8054160"," And you have more buyers than sellers in the market this morning. So they are going to dictate where we go"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8055520","8062560"," Unless they disappear unless something spooks them, you know, it could spook them as if they don't have enough runway into Tuesday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8063440","8065440"," they need to be able to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8065600","8068720"," Get a hold under the market and push it up between now and Tuesday"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8069440","8072160"," Unless they know something about Biden's speech that we don't know"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8072720","8075520"," Maybe it's some positive news that we have no idea about"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8076160","8079680"," But you can see that mansion got bought by gs 100%"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8080400","8084000"," I'd put a I'd put a million dollars down on on mansion"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8085120","8087680"," Getting bought by gs. There was a smooth move. I like it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8089200","8091200"," I like to move"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8092160","8096240"," Can you look at apple? Yeah, I'll check apple for you. You guys are going to check some flows for you"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","8297920","8300640"," 24 and 27. I can be wrong on that without looking at it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8301440","8306400"," But it's just off top of my head. I wanted to see I wanted to see the gap close at 26 27"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8306880","8312560"," I really you guys have heard me say I didn't like santa rally until we hit 30 on the vix"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","8344400","8346400"," Let's take a look at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8348560","8350560"," Misfit now"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","8376160","8378160"," And right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8379680","8383760"," The buyers outnumber the sellers. So hope that helps"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8385600","8391040"," If you want some bigger numbers ready, I've got bigger numbers for you if you're a misfit investor"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8391920","8393920"," You have hard support at 300"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8395760","8398080"," Your next level of support is 310"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8399120","8401280"," And your next level support is 315"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8402000","8410000"," So for today you'll find buyers at 315. Okay, you've got resistance above at 325"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8410960","8417680"," You've got small resistance above at 330 and 335 but your next major resistance is 340"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8418880","8425440"," So that makes misfit highly squeezable just as it heads up misfit could easily squeeze to 340"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8426240","8428240"," Which is wild because that stock never moves"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8430080","8433200"," Hopefully you guys can see this on your you can see this final"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8433920","8438800"," Book map right here. I'll show it to you with my cursor. You'll see support here at 300"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","8440640","8441760"," 315"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8441760","8447200"," 315 is where your buyers are currently. Okay, your first real resistance is at 325"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8447760","8450720"," You've got a couple minor resistances up here. They don't really need anything"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8451200","8457040"," 330 335 some of this 340 could swoop down but in reality your wall is up here at 340"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8457840","8460640"," Next what i'm going to do for you is tesla"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8469680","8471680"," I think tight here"

"BDkVo3_KcxI","8569840","8571040"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8571040","8575760"," Let's look at tesla. This is a good one to look at for you guys out there that are shorting or logging tesla"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8578800","8580800"," And"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8582320","8586560"," Yeah, this is wild. I mean, let's look at a big tesla's an interesting one to look for"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8587040","8590080"," To look at. Okay, this this is a good one to be looking at right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8590640","8593600"," Because you can see a stark difference in tesla to other stocks"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8594480","8599040"," This show this this this heat map on tesla shows so there so right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8599440","8604560"," Just as a let's start at the beginning. So right now tesla is very it's highly shorted"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8605520","8608720"," It has a major hedge on it major shorting on it"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8609360","8611360"," I don't short tesla right now. Okay"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8611920","8619280"," I want you guys to understand something as a retail trade or the danger of shorting some stocks and tesla here specifically"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8620080","8623520"," Is a reason one of the reasons I don't short tesla is because I like the company"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8625600","8627920"," But the major reason why I don't ever short tesla"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8629760","8631840"," Is because looking at this heat map right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8632800","8638560"," There is so much love for tesla out there. You've got major support right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8639920","8641920"," At 890"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8641920","8647200"," You've got major support at 880 875 870"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8647760","8650400"," You've got dip buyers lined up down here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8651200","8653200"," to long tesla"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8654160","8659200"," You also have these these uh light blue areas here and this white area here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8659520","8662240"," I mean this is major support for tesla right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8663200","8667040"," And I don't think that it's actual support. I think that it's just buyers ready to buy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8667440","8669200"," People are ready to buy tesla"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8669200","8673760"," Anything that looks cheap on tesla gets bought and when you look above on tesla right here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8674320","8676480"," Even though it's being heavily shorted right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8677040","8680240"," The potential for it to squeeze to stupid highs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8680880","8684000"," Is always there when you see this big black space up here"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8684400","8686480"," This is called clear blue sky"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8686480","8691200"," The moment that you start breaking through like 92925 even 930"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8691600","8694960"," You're going to get a spike to ridiculous highs"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8695600","8698080"," Like you're talking like clear sailing to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8700160","8702160"," This crazy watching this stuff"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8705040","8710080"," I'll even get in on a smaller level for you here so you can see where major support levels are"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8710080","8717680"," When you've got major buyers at 890 major buyers at 880"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8718480","8721360"," You've got a sea of blue and white in between them"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8722560","8724240"," 870"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8724240","8729760"," Is probably where it starts to really start to fall if the shorts are able to get below 870 look out below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8730720","8734080"," But in reality the support on tesla right now is kind of stupid"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8735040","8738000"," And the potential to squeeze it to like a thousand"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8738880","8744400"," Is is easy anything above 930 and it's squeezing to close to a thousand"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8746960","8749600"," How about how about amazon? Yeah, let me do amazon for you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8759360","8761600"," And then I gotta get back I gotta get my own trade and all right"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8763040","8765040"," But i'm done with you guys. I got to do my own trade"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8768160","8770160"," Let's see"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8770160","8774480"," I gotta look at my stuff here because I know about some of my shits burning 100 percent. It's burning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8778480","8782240"," Great i'm grateful that I have some spreads on that can take this punishment today"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8782960","8784960"," And hopefully hopefully I can un-f myself"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8786000","8790880"," Up if we swing higher to 460 i'm sure there's a stack of sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8791440","8795840"," Of sellers at 460 just waiting to un-f themselves like myself"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8798320","8800320"," So"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8803760","8805760"," All right, so let's let's look at amazon next"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8814560","8820480"," Amazon's a hedge funds lover amazon banks love amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8822560","8826000"," I traded amazon for a long time. It's a very nice stock to trade"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8826560","8831200"," It's true. I always can I compare spy right now to trading amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8832320","8835520"," It's uh spy has been very easy to trade"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8836400","8839920"," And amazon has been is known to be an easy stock to trade"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8840960","8844080"," The only problem people have with amazon is the size that you have to put on"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8844880","8847360"," If you get take a hit in amazon, it's big money"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8856080","8858080"," Yeah"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8859040","8861360"," Yeah, and there's no ceiling on amazon right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8862800","8864640"," It's get their blue skies on amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8866240","8868400"," Amazon has firm support at"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8869520","8871520"," 3,300"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8874960","8879600"," It has a stack of buyers. I mean this makes me believe that this is just positioning by banks"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8879840","8883840"," When you see when I see stuff like this when I see charts like amazon right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8886800","8888800"," There are literally no sellers above"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8889760","8891760"," None"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8891920","8894160"," And it's all accumulation by banks right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8896640","8898640"," All this is right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8899440","8905200"," When you guys are looking at like when you guys when you guys are looking at the market right now and you're telling me the market's going to sell off"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8905840","8908000"," And I open up an amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8908000","8914160"," And all I see are banks buying amazon. That's all I see right now and we're talking like"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8914960","8917280"," I'm talking like a hundred to one"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8918160","8920240"," Let's let's look and see look let's look and see this"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8922240","8924880"," So when you you got 27,000 buys"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8925600","8927760"," buyers to 16,000 sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8928320","8931840"," Almost almost two to one buyers to sellers"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8932640","8934080"," On amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8934080","8939360"," So you're telling me that the market's going to crash right now and then I look at a bank favorite"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8940160","8944080"," I look at a bank favorite and what are they doing while we're on today?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8944720","8950320"," They're over here on the day after opex loading up on amazon. That's what they're doing right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8951040","8953040"," Loading the boats on amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8955360","8957360"," Wild"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8959200","8965520"," You see something like this and you hear you hear like a gs is telling you the market's going to crash"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8966400","8971200"," And you can see live real time right now that gs is buying amazon"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8972080","8974080"," So explain that to me"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8974480","8979360"," Explain explain to me how gs is selling the market, but they're actually buying amazon right now"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8985200","8987200"," And his pure insanity"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8989280","8994000"," All right, so i'm going to wrap it up after this i want to make sure this got this stuff gets to you"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8995680","8997680"," I"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","8999200","9001200"," Hope this has helped you guys out this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9006160","9010320"," Uh, if you guys want me to do you guys want me to"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9011920","9016480"," I can rehash all this if you want if you're late joining I can do a rehash"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9018320","9023600"," I'm gonna switch from amazon and head back to the spy real quick because it is the definitive market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9024480","9028960"," I want you guys to realize that too like if you're looking at the overall market health"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9029600","9034800"," You're looking at the spy always. It's always your number one go to we can look"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9037840","9043040"," We can look at the at iwm for weakness and it's a way to look at the market"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9043920","9046960"," But if you're looking for the overall market health we're looking at the spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9047360","9056880"," And the spy probably has firmed up a little bit at this point. We're gonna we're gonna get a little bit better"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9066960","9069280"," Try to get a better viewpoint of the spy"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9076960","9086400"," Okay, so before i'm going to log off here in just a moment. I'm going to give you one last recap. Okay?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9087440","9089440"," So traditionally"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9090160","9092800"," The monday sunday monday after opx"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9093520","9095520"," Is very weak"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9095520","9101600"," There's not enough runway for all the transactions to take place on friday opx. It leads into the overnight"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9102160","9106720"," Weakness. I'm sure there are hedge funds that know that they can come in"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9107200","9114080"," In the overnight in futures sell the market down make quick bank and exit the markets. They do it every single year"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9114960","9124800"," Normally you will see a huge bid come into the market at 4 a.m. By 11 a.m. You'll see a large move up on monday's"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9126320","9128320"," We're not seeing that this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9128960","9133040"," I don't know the I don't know the reason for that probably because of where we are in the markets"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9133760","9139040"," But in turn what also happened this morning due to us not catching that bid this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9139920","9143200"," Is we switched from positive gamma to negative gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9144880","9147680"," That flips all of your support resistance levels"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9148320","9153760"," It puts you into negative gamma doesn't put us put us into bear country"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9154160","9156480"," But it puts us into a bearish context"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9157040","9161200"," That means that you're going to start selling the rips until proven otherwise"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9163760","9169360"," You're going to look for different support levels than before and different resistance levels than before"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9170560","9175680"," So and you're going to look for some resolution because we're in negative gamma just like when we're in positive gamma"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9176080","9181520"," You're looking for some resolution now. We looked above right we looked above just last week"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9181600","9183920"," We got to all-time highs by up tick or two"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9184640","9189680"," And we looked above and we were rejected. We are going to do that same thing down here below"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9190240","9194080"," We're looking down below. We want to test at 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9194880","9197360"," We didn't quite get to 448 this morning"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9198480","9203920"," Because we have those opx buyers that are still trying to buy from the sellers, right?"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9204480","9209440"," So we know now that 460 has flipped from support to resistance"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9210240","9213440"," You're going to look for the market to move back up to 460"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9214000","9217760"," Reject and sell down once more to 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9218400","9221120"," To either send us into bear country"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9221680","9226240"," That would mean that you're not a bull anymore. You're you're bear and we're going to sell down"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9226880","9230560"," Uh to probably the first target would be 439"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9231200","9233200"," if we break through 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9234080","9238400"," That's that's your target if you get bearish and that's their target if we break through 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9239120","9241120"," Now if we reject 448"
"BDkVo3_KcxI","9242640","9245120"," after"
