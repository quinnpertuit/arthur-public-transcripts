"260","1260"," Check 1-2."
"1440","6440"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"6440","8160"," before the film begins."
"103450","103590"," Good morning. "
"105950","110350"," Good morning out there."
"110550","111490"," Hope everybody is doing well."
"120220","121940"," Alright, so I got all that stuff up there. "
"122080","123100"," Let's go right into it this morning."
"124240","133780"," Tell you what, trying to get the stream up has become much longer unexpectedly."
"135720","139920"," I got extra stuff to do in the morning so I can make sure that I'm coming in a little"
"139920","140520"," bit early here. "
"142220","144820"," Okay, so let's get started right away this morning."
"145180","151680"," We were up this morning early and then we sold off before we even got here underneath the pivot."
"153060","154420"," Not what I want to see. "
"154780","156260"," Now, I am in calls."
"156640","162980"," I was in calls overnight for, I believe I've got them for the first, I'll check my broker just"
"162980","164600"," opened, but I'm not in it at this moment."
"165200","171500"," Now, if it is selling off into the next day, I will hold, it's the only time I'll hold an"
"171500","175980"," overnight position as if it's down into the open. "
"176200","179520"," If it's up, I take it right on the bell, but if it's down, I hold on to it."
"180480","183260"," So, take a look at those calls this morning and see how they're fairing."
"183260","185800"," So, we're now 10 minutes away from the top of the hour. "
"185980","190520"," One of the headline events for the day with the US conference board consumer confidence for gas, a"
"190520","198020"," 108 spot five prior 107 spot one range of 112 spot four to 105 spot four."
"198300","200580"," We do also get the Richmond Fed Composite Index."
"200940","203280"," Prior minus 11. "
"212690","213990"," No, they're not doing too bad."
"214230","214890"," They could be worse."
"216610","218010"," They're doing, they're doing all right. "
"218230","218850"," They're still healthy."
"219510","221930"," So, that wasn't actually too bad."
"222990","225450"," So, I've got some calls for the first. "
"226510","231030"," Now, there are some call buyers this morning again at 398 C."
"232490","237310"," That's got me not quite worried at this point, but not happy either."
"238290","241230"," So, right off the bell this morning, we've got for February 28."
"242130","247270"," Today we've got 60,000 calls on 398 C."
"248650","250110"," Kind of in the money, right?"
"250670","254250"," And we're below the pivot this morning and it is end of month. "
"254810","259350"," We talked about yesterday that this isn't our market, right?"
"259769","262470"," So, and where is the market going?"
"262790","263550"," Fascinatingly enough."
"264530","266270"," A couple of people that I look up to."
"268730","271310"," I look towards to for their guidance sometimes. "
"272410","274570"," Have the same opinion as I do."
"274930","277890"," And so, I went and checked in with those guys late last night."
"278070","280210"," And they're the same, they have the same opinion that I have that. "
"280810","285350"," It's really is too hard to call right now where this market is and where it's going."
"286550","289890"," You could have like one guy that's like, yeah, it's going up and if it goes up, you can be"
"289890","292790"," like, yeah, look and I called it and the other guy could be like, it's going down."
"292790","294850"," He can be like, yeah, I called it. "
"294990","299770"," But the truth is that you really can't call it at this point."
"299890","304330"," There's nothing to call as to where this market is going right now."
"304570","308010"," All indicators are pointing in different directions. "
"308270","317050"," I'm looking at PPOs and PPMs and the PPM, PPMs are disagreeing with each"
"317050","322770"," other."
"323770","345530"," I'm"
"345530","352750"," looking at PPOs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and"
"352750","352750"," PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and"
"352750","352750"," PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and"
"352750","352750"," PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and PPMs and"
"352750","355290"," PPMs and PPMs and PPMs. What am I fighting end of month for two days?"
"355790","359410"," If this is a bank that's like we wanted here, why fight that?"
"359530","360050"," There's no point. "
"361950","366930"," So I think that's where I was left with last night was let this care out for the end of"
"366930","367130"," the month."
"368190","374130"," There's no point in trying to fight where the market is and where they want the market, right?"
"374270","375350"," Where they're going to park the market."
"375550","376830"," They're going to say, I want it at this price. "
"377390","379010"," We don't care what you want, right?"
"379010","381610"," We don't care what sentiment is."
"381690","384830"," We don't care what the buyers want or the sellers want."
"385410","386390"," We want the price. "
"386850","387650"," It's our market."
"387810","388670"," You just get to play in it."
"388750","390850"," I think that's what I'm left with here. "
"391590","395470"," Now, there's some other things I talked last night on the phone with a few people about."
"396210","398470"," So we'll make it into that today as well."
"399190","403890"," I was talking with a friend last night and I said, boy, I said, you know what?"
"404570","405850"," I said, I don't. "
"405930","406810"," So the past couple of weeks."
"408050","413930"," I said, I've done done better with my one and two date positions than my zero date positions."
"414090","415290"," And it's become more glaring. "
"416850","420030"," This being the second week where I'm down on the first day of the week."
"420950","422650"," So I'm like, this is odd and not usual."
"423490","426850"," And the other thing that we were talking about in this conversation was. "
"428010","430990"," Is our zero dates under the microscope right now?"
"430990","432330"," I was like, you know what?"
"432450","433310"," I wonder if they are."
"433970","438570"," You hear people out there that will say they'll start to speak like they know what they're talking"
"438570","439410"," about in zero dates."
"439810","442070"," And you're like, that motherfucker doesn't trade zero dates. "
"442110","443170"," The fuck he's talking about."
"443590","450010"," And you realize that though they may not admit it, they're probably out there day trading zero"
"450010","450330"," dates."
"451430","456890"," You know, when something goes into the microscope, everyone out there now says, you know, fuck"
"456890","458010"," those zero date traders. "
"458010","463050"," But in fact, more than likely you're attracting that person to trade zero dates."
"463730","466390"," That wouldn't normally trade zero dates."
"466410","468810"," So that leads into the next question. "
"469290","469990"," Hold on a second here."
"471570","474770"," That leads into the next question where you're like, Hey, I wonder if."
"475450","480870"," I wonder if I was a, if I was a buy or sell side, by fact, I had a bot. "
"481610","487290"," I bet I can track where everybody is in this market on zero date, especially in the microscope."
"487290","494210"," One hundred and eight spot five and I bet I can run a bot and take 10, 20, 30%"
"494210","495630"," and get out before anyone else."
"496150","497870"," So they end up eating each other. "
"498050","502870"," So that led into a conversation last night where I was like, we have to start speaking with."
"503450","509750"," We have to start talking about positions in like some kind of secret, secret kind of a"
"509750","510230"," conversation."
"511090","514230"," We're like a flash, a piece of broccoli up on the screen or something. "
"514610","518070"," This dream is a plan to take, you know, that kind of stuff."
"518350","519350"," You see that."
"519470","522309"," Sometimes in other places, right?"
"522390","523210"," You'll see that in Wall Street. "
"523210","525810"," That's they'll, they'll scare what their positioning is."
"526130","530030"," You'll see people on fin to it obscure what they're saying to you."
"530470","532310"," So that bots can't pick up on it. "
"532430","535310"," Matter of fact, I kept his office behind a paywall."
"536330","541250"," Paywall behind a follow wall where you have to request to follow me there."
"541370","547490"," It's free, but you have to request to follow me there because I'm trying to keep out bots that will"
"547490","548450"," try to scam you. "
"548710","551770"," So you'll never see like bots scams in that sub."
"553130","555910"," Asking you to join a telegram or anything like that."
"556590","560870"," So just these basic measures to stop someone. "
"561990","563110"," Doing something nefarious."
"563270","565150"," I think that's the point, right?"
"565410","570050"," First, first, first problem is you've got now you've got too many people being like, yeah, I'm"
"570050","571950"," going to get out there and I'm going to trade some zero dates."
"572810","576490"," You know, and then because of the microscope, everybody's talking about zero dates. "
"577150","583410"," And so the second issue you have is more than likely some smart guy or woman is like, oh, yeah,"
"583530","585010"," I'm just going to build a bot right now."
"585010","587590"," And I'm just going to I'm just going to shave off 10, 20, 30%."
"587590","589910"," That's faster than a human trainer can do it. "
"590050","593330"," So we had that conversation late last night."
"593450","599110"," I called a very smart friend of mine and he was too busy to take my call last night."
"599110","606170"," He was his party in down in Florida, frolicking on the beach or something, eating fried donuts and"
"606170","609770"," drinking tequila or something like that. "
"610550","615110"," But I was going to have him answer that question for me because he's a guy that I could probably"
"615110","619710"," have build a bot in about five seconds to track that kind of stuff."
"619890","624130"," And so I'm fascinated to see if that's possibly going on in the background as well right now."
"624550","632250"," When you're into the microscope like that, sometimes you have to change your strategy slightly and"
"632250","637070"," then maybe obscure what you're doing just enough to trick. "
"638390","641790"," Trick or not allow a bot to find out what you're doing."
"642770","645150"," So we'll see what your thoughts are on that this morning."
"645150","647110"," If you have any thoughts on that this morning. "
"648370","651250"," Talk about in the chat because I know some of you guys out there are programmers."
"652270","657110"," Some of you guys know what you're doing when it comes to writing code, even simple code to just"
"657110","658130"," track what people are doing."
"659590","661030"," This isn't really front running. "
"661390","665410"," I was trying to explain this to a friend last night where if you found positionally where people"
"665410","666050"," were in the market."
"666770","671810"," If there was enough of a position in the market, you jump in with those people with size."
"672470","678470"," So it seems like it's going where you want it to go and then you pull out that size at"
"678470","679950"," like 10, 20, 30%. "
"680450","684210"," So the impression is that all market is heading in that direction."
"684850","690330"," Everybody loads up and jumps on, although the real size in that trade pulls out earlier than anyone"
"690330","690810"," else."
"690970","693010"," And that's how you get trapped in those positions. "
"693890","697210"," I don't know if that's real or not, but it's fascinating to think about."
"697210","704930"," So maybe we'll maybe we'll do some we'll do some broccoli and some some asparagus or something like"
"704930","705190"," that."
"705670","709770"," We'll go into your hot dogs hot dog water hallways. "
"711710","713250"," Something like that this morning."
"716250","716750"," Okay."
"717430","718290"," Just a second. "
"718430","722270"," Let me read your your comments this morning and see what you're all thinking here."
"722490","724430"," I'll lead with the USB consumer confidence."
"728510","733250"," Just saying we get this all set up for us this morning, but this market air out. "
"735190","736790"," And not much going on, man."
"737330","738670"," We're sitting right on."
"739050","743210"," Let me just second here and I'll I'll bring up the figures for you so you can see it. "
"754940","755900"," The Richmond Fed."
"756080","760680"," Out early at minus 16 minus 16 lower than forecast at minus five."
"760860","763280"," So again, that's the Richmond Fed composite index come out earlier. "
"768260","769500"," 10 seconds to consumer."
"769740","772280"," It's looking pretty bullish, believe it or not."
"778720","780700"," But not a hell of a lot going on, right?"
"780840","784340"," It's like one hundred and two spot nine one hundred and two spot nine. "
"784340","787240"," That's low than forecast one hundred and eight spot five."
"789000","791400"," Not a whole lot going on this morning."
"791600","793340"," Now, if you look looking here. "
"795860","797480"," On our early velocity."
"799640","802640"," The huge down moves have become less."
"803640","805200"," Let me see they can meet this. "
"808760","810440"," You just book map here."
"811180","815300"," You can see that the south side has lifted."
"816700","817340"," Off the market. "
"823550","825450"," Should get a squeeze out of that."
"831670","833770"," You should mark two places."
"834290","837550"," We've got this one place mark right here at three ninety seven eighty nine. "
"838310","840270"," And then we've got three ninety eight twenty."
"841170","845650"," So three ninety eight twenty and then three ninety seven eighty nine."
"845810","849110"," So mark both of those places on the market this morning. "
"849870","852270"," And then above that is."
"853330","857410"," Our same nemesis from yesterday for two fifty seven."
"858550","861990"," So mark this on your chart at this point. "
"862230","866350"," You can also see our lead trend is coming less negative."
"866990","870650"," It's not at we're not coming into into negativity in the market."
"870990","874950"," Some slight weakness in the dollar a bit of strength in the U.S. index is following. "
"875610","879330"," That was in the south side of this market here watching my cursor."
"880190","882110"," Becoming less and less over time."
"882270","884970"," We talked about this consumer inflation rate. "
"885170","887030"," The price has not been following."
"887290","892690"," And the implication and if we can't squeeze higher you can actually see it right here happening."
"892690","897170"," We're going to slide down with revision and consumers one year inflation expectations. "
"898890","901930"," So we'll do as well mark this on the chart this morning."
"902130","904930"," The U.S.C.B. consumer confidence on the feed for those interested."
"908930","910890"," Three ninety seven eighty six. "
"917870","925780"," This is the the Jim bros the young Jim bros right here three ninety eight seventeen."
"933570","937190"," Swellers are quite low this morning they're right in on the market right here."
"940610","944630"," The Jim bros these are the Jim bros right here the young guy the young Jim bros are down here"
"944630","945870"," and the swellers are right above. "
"947270","951290"," So the swellers are the swellers are here today they're like yeah you know we're."
"952250","956570"," We're here to sell this market bro you ain't going nowhere we're not going up they're right here."
"957410","961870"," Now if we get above these two groups of sellers here right. "
"962890","965850"," We are looking for that same place as yesterday."
"971340","975660"," That's four oh two fifty four believe it or not way up here."
"995880","1001160"," We've got some H lines above here right there's an H line. "
"1016380","1020100"," We've got a small gap right here at three ninety eight ninety five."
"1020620","1023260"," You can see that on your screen but there is a gap."
"1024640","1026380"," Two gaps there's a gap right here. "
"1026960","1031720"," I'll put the swellers right here where that first gap is there's another gap above right here."
"1033819","1038980"," And there's this gap down below here so be aware of this one down here that's still sitting here."
"1039700","1043940"," Still miss or still have still have a gap that has been closed down below. "
"1063530","1066490"," Gaps everywhere man we got gaps down here gaps above."
"1070970","1072510"," All needs cleaned up."
"1073990","1076710"," Previous low back here we got a previous low. "
"1077390","1081710"," Click ready got those lows there we got all these ones where we're cleaned up already."
"1082310","1087910"," The US dollar index adds to losses after the consumer confidence data lost our zero spot one seven"
"1087910","1088490"," two percent."
"1093960","1096360"," Let's take a look at five minute here. "
"1098140","1101300"," We really need to get above here to take a call position."
"1102560","1108960"," For some kind of a of a move higher otherwise it is bearish from here where the swellers are from"
"1108960","1109800"," this red and yellow."
"1111980","1115340"," Boxes we are bearish here until we trade above both of these. "
"1116840","1118200"," To the hourly here."
"1121720","1127220"," It's interesting that we've got this green box above but yet this is a cause for concern here."
"1129580","1132580"," We got sold down yesterday right at our one. "
"1134380","1139960"," For that PT two was from yesterday so we're going to make this one PT two again for today."
"1143960","1146120"," If we can get above this red box right here."
"1149140","1150620"," To our early trend. "
"1159570","1160890"," Right there that looks good."
"1172450","1174590"," I'm actually thinking might be in the money now."
"1179100","1180800"," About five cents under right now. "
"1182540","1185300"," A little bit higher to be making money right now."
"1212030","1213210"," PT two there."
"1219860","1221480"," You want to know what the H line is?"
"1221800","1226080"," You'll have to ask my man Jason Hendricks what the H line is. "
"1226700","1228480"," Let me say hello to you guys this morning."
"1228640","1231500"," Let me just check in and with everybody looks like we've got everybody in the chat."
"1232220","1232780"," Good morning Steve. "
"1232820","1233300"," Good morning."
"1233500","1235160"," Good morning."
"1235160","1236600"," I expected a visit. "
"1236600","1237700"," Good morning Troy Corp."
"1242260","1243620"," Good morning Jimmy Bieri."
"1245860","1246920"," Good morning Rich. "

"1257080","1258380"," Morning blind nest owl."

"1315540","1316300"," Forex and stock. "
"1316460","1317540"," I've been pounding water."
"1317860","1318280"," It doesn't matter."
"1318980","1319740"," Take strike dot com. "
"1320280","1323220"," So BBY is doing very well this morning."
"1323380","1324300"," It broke through yesterday."
"1324300","1326120"," We showed this 145. "
"1327060","1328480"," This one 51."
"1328960","1331840"," Now if the one minute can catch up here and BBY."
"1333520","1337180"," So we want the one minute to cut to come higher here. "
"1340200","1343680"," Right here and we want the five minute to come up here."
"1345160","1348860"," So we get the five minutes to come up here if we can get any kind of price consolidation."
"1350280","1352500"," In here we might see a rip higher. "
"1352760","1354460"," So we're looking for."

"1369400","1371220"," See how this wasn't consolidation. "
"1371800","1373200"," This was distribution, right?"
"1373400","1375280"," We traded above the hourly."
"1376040","1379560"," And rather than consolidate we broke below and started trade."
"1379840","1381420"," So price went below the one minute. "
"1381420","1385260"," And we don't want that to happen for a trip higher."
"1385540","1391120"," I want price to stay above the one minute to five minute and the hourly for proof."
"1392000","1393240"," That we're going higher right. "
"1393620","1395160"," So we'll do here with BBY."

"1417630","1421310"," We want price to stay or come above at some point."
"1422270","1425030"," And hold a dollar fifty one. "

"1458160","1459900"," If you didn't know before now you do. "
"1462920","1465220"," These are the little Jim Bros."
"1465480","1466600"," Here and these are the big Jim Bros."
"1466780","1467060"," Up here. "
"1468940","1470960"," So we'll look at BBY real quick."
"1474790","1476210"," And what you're looking for."
"1476950","1480070"," Now you see that they sold the one fifty three right here right. "
"1481150","1484690"," And we're trading below the one in the five minute on BBY."
"1485070","1487430"," Now what you're looking for is."

"1511000","1514600"," And if it don't be too concerned with something like this."
"1514740","1516100"," Don't want you to be like all freaked out. "
"1516840","1519340"," Now if price can come back up here."
"1519980","1521680"," And hold one fifty one right."
"1522400","1523480"," And begin to consolidate. "
"1524140","1525260"," You become a buyer here."
"1525260","1528880"," And you have stops underneath like one forty eight one forty nine."
"1528880","1529580"," That kind of stuff. "
"1529940","1533380"," If it starts to consolidate here you'll be looking for a trade higher."
"1534140","1535720"," And the two places for that trade."

"2247230","2252470"," US monthly crude oil output fell to 12 spot one million boughs per day in December."
"2254170","2256730"," Yeah, I'd rather take it at some point. "
"2256830","2259630"," I really finally realized after dating crazy a few times."
"2260970","2264850"," I finally realized they kind of try to meet someone that you can be friends with."
"2265890","2267890"," You do that in your happier person in life. "
"2268230","2271050"," I think that that matters if you're a guy, a girl, whatever up there."
"2272470","2274830"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"2275110","2277070"," I think you're able to make that person life gets easier. "
"2278170","2282190"," They don't look at other men either when they're your best friend."
"2282350","2283870"," I think maybe they do."
"2285150","2288130"," But again, we're not dating crazy anymore. "
"2294330","2295110"," Taking wives."
"2302110","2304470"," To be honest, suppose that you can just borrow life."
"2304470","2305370"," I agree with that too. "
"2306390","2307670"," I don't disagree with that."
"2309130","2310630"," I don't disagree with that at all."
"2316490","2319990"," Honestly, I can't say I haven't done crazy more than once. "
"2320910","2321570"," I have."
"2323070","2324450"," Then you just get tired of it."
"2324490","2326830"," You're like, I think I can't do this anymore. "
"2329550","2330830"," Can't do crazy anymore."
"2332070","2334630"," Although it looks tempting every once in a while, right?"
"2335210","2336090"," Especially when you get older."
"2336270","2339230"," That's crazy too is now that I'm an older guy. "
"2339630","2342790"," I'm like, I just wonder how many older guys looked at me when I was young and was like, that"
"2342790","2343870"," guy's stupid as fuck."
"2345530","2347130"," He's dating crazy right now."
"2347570","2348750"," He thinks that's normal. "
"2355240","2357940"," You have to replace your third, great kids and floor."
"2358560","2362920"," I was talking to a buddy two days ago, he's redoing his, I'm not going to say who it is,"
"2363040","2365260"," but a friend of mine of the show is redoing his bathroom."
"2366380","2367820"," We were talking about bathrooms. "
"2367860","2371580"," And I was like, I was like, yeah, all that Schluter shit is awesome."
"2372780","2375880"," If you're going to keep a bathroom for fucking 20 or 30 years, it's great."
"2376960","2378340"," I was like, but let's be honest. "
"2378900","2380680"," I was like, who the fuck keeps it going?"
"2380680","2382080"," You're in the kitchen for 20, 30 years anymore."
"2383560","2385800"," You're in there building your $70,000 kitchen."
"2386580","2389420"," Some other person moves in and they're like, this is ugly. "
"2389760","2391200"," Let's rip it out and put another one in."
"2391380","2391760"," Something different."
"2392600","2392980"," I don't like that. "
"2393140","2393860"," I don't like their taste."
"2394620","2398760"," Like so many of our, we used to build, they used to be like this thing where if you built"
"2398760","2403420"," a bathroom or a kitchen, you go to someone's house that could be 20, 30 years old."
"2403640","2404220"," That was like a thing. "
"2405040","2411780"," The quality and craftsmanship and the look of your house and stuff."
"2412960","2419040"," I can't, I can't tell you how many times today you see people that just are like, nope, we're"
"2419040","2419440"," ripping it out."
"2419560","2420280"," We're doing something different. "
"2420500","2424840"," So I'm like, what's the point sometimes been putting in that bathroom in the last 30 years?"
"2425900","2428740"," It only needs to be there for as long as you're living in that house, I think."
"2430400","2431200"," At this point."
"2431200","2439420"," Oh, no. "
"2439660","2442480"," After you place your, I didn't read the rest of your comments, Winky."
"2443500","2447980"," He says, after you place your third kitchen floor because the girl broke all of your dishes on your"
"2447980","2449060"," tile, it gets old."
"2452460","2452820"," Terrible. "
"2453500","2454780"," How about some of the women in the broadcast?"
"2455300","2457380"," They must have some stories as well."
"2457560","2458620"," I'm sure that you can date her."
"2458760","2460360"," I bet your women can date a lot of crazy too. "
"2461600","2466620"," You meet guys and they are same normal and then you find out that they're, that they're batshit"
"2466620","2466800"," crazy."
"2478480","2480840"," Oh, Ohm says he married a hot chick that used to work."
"2481760","2483120"," Zumba, the gym I worked out. "
"2486190","2488050"," Women don't date crazy, they date nice guys."
"2491580","2493060"," Crazy hot matrix is real."
"2494420","2495900"," Yeah, I think that goes for both sides. "
"2496720","2498360"," I think you can find crazy if you want to."
"2500400","2505180"," I think I'm more interested in what older people think about it."
"2505520","2513040"," I think, like, I think when you're young, we all have similar experiences, right?"
"2513200","2517340"," Or at least new experiences where you're like, well, you're like, I feel like the older that I get"
"2517340","2520440"," the some parts of life become easier. "
"2522720","2527920"," I think you're like, so you have all these new experiences and you don't know how to interact with"
"2527920","2528060"," them."
"2528060","2530100"," And then I think when you get older, you're like, I've seen this before."
"2530240","2531680"," I'm not getting involved in that ever again. "
"2534260","2535880"," What do you think in the chat, I guess?"
"2536220","2542180"," If you're, as a matter of fact, if you're like, even becoming comfortable as a person, I didn't get"
"2542180","2548740"," comfortable as a person until I was maybe mid to late 20s, somewhere in there, mid late 20s to"
"2548740","2555100"," start to feel, start to feel like coming into myself by 30 hours, like, man, this is awesome."
"2555100","2557780"," Like, I love my 30s."
"2557880","2558960"," I was like, this is great. "
"2559300","2561080"," I feel really good being in my 30s."
"2573810","2574970"," Thanks for saying that."
"2575130","2575730"," I appreciate that. "
"2582100","2583820"," I didn't know that that studies show that."
"2593580","2599180"," People don't really become people until they're 28 or 30."
"2599280","2602420"," I thought when I hit 30, I would be scared of it. "
"2603340","2604780"," I'm like, oh, man, I'm becoming old."
"2605100","2605780"," I'm becoming a boomer."
"2606720","2608540"," And then I was like, I kind of like this here. "
"2616960","2619520"," But that's another thing that kind of, like, while you're like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, you"
"2619520","2620860"," shouldn't say it's like boomers, right?"
"2621000","2621820"," That term boomers."
"2622820","2625440"," I always assign that to the boomer generation."
"2625600","2628380"," Now you like, you can be like 18 years old and you're a boomer. "
"2628520","2629240"," Look it out of here, boomer."
"2629540","2629760"," You're 18."
"2636020","2641120"," I've seen that the UK plans to sell a four spot, five billion pounds or five spot, four, six"
"2641120","2646720"," billion dollars of three spot, five percent bonds to October 22nd, 2025 in an auction on March 7th. "
"2647260","2648100"," That's an issuance from DNA."
"2648100","2650060"," I mean, just look at this, right?"
"2650300","2652240"," No, no movement at all this morning."
"2652580","2654200"," Just grinding sideways here. "
"2654500","2656820"," It reminds me of a Friday almost, right?"
"2657220","2657800"," Pretend of month."
"2659020","2662400"," So it's like, let them do their thing is the point of this broadcast today."
"2663900","2666540"," Initially, I was like, yeah, maybe we don't do a broadcast today. "
"2666580","2672620"," I'm like, there might not be a reason to do a broadcast today only because I was like, maybe we"
"2672620","2674080"," just trade sideways all day long."
"2674260","2676200"," Maybe we just make the only get a move at end of day."
"2676980","2678840"," They grind stuff down all day long. "
"2679060","2680140"," Then we get a move in the day."
"2680800","2683320"," It is kind of turning into that at this moment, right?"
"2683480","2688160"," You're seeing not too much action in the market currently."
"2693360","2697940"," BBY trying to get back above to 151 still hasn't got up there yet. "
"2698640","2700140"," Still down below at 142."
"2706580","2707680"," But it's brewing."
"2708100","2708720"," So we're watching it. "
"2708800","2710080"," I'm watching BBY in the background."
"2713980","2718140"," Tesla selling off down in now testing currently."
"2718780","2720220"," It's five minute at 204. "
"2722260","2723340"," 204 99."
"2723600","2724780"," So we'll look at Tesla here."
"2725140","2727520"," You might get some weakness in the market right now. "
"2727520","2729920"," So we'll find out kind of testing."
"2731200","2733980"," I'm going to bring up Tesla here real quick for you."
"2735320","2736040"," Let's take a look. "
"2736160","2738180"," Let's take a walk around the market and just take a peek around."
"2738180","2741580"," So this is Tesla currently that we're looking at right here."
"2742500","2743640"," And it is testing. "
"2743880","2744960"," It's hourly right now."
"2745240","2747140"," This is a cause that cause we're concerned."
"2747480","2750360"," But you want to see Tesla stay above. "
"2750360","2752900"," It's hourly the moment that it trades below it."
"2753200","2755000"," It's usually not a good sign."
"2755280","2755400"," Okay. "
"2756240","2757380"," So I want you to see."
"2758560","2763340"," When we trade below hourly, what takes place where that leads to."
"2764200","2767900"," And so you want to stay on track here to get up to this 220. "
"2768660","2770800"," And you can see where this 220 is right here."
"2772860","2777400"," And you can actually see now that time is passing."
"2778320","2780100"," We had 228 above here. "
"2780880","2787420"," And now we've got a seller or monthly sellers coming down from above on Tesla."
"2788000","2789680"," This is where the concern is."
"2790120","2790340"," Yeah. "
"2790460","2790920"," I'll meet this up."
"2791040","2792340"," We're going to be looking at real quick."
"2792980","2797140"," We talked about Tesla and most of tech looks like this. "
"2797980","2800160"," If you were to look at most of tech, right?"
"2800300","2801500"," Most of bang man plus tea."
"2802320","2807160"," We discussed not getting stuck here, uh, diddling in the middle."
"2808180","2812340"," Uh, now we'll look at this in a larger time frame here so you can see what I'm talking about"
"2812340","2812500"," here. "
"2814940","2818300"," And you want, you asked the question, is tech done?"
"2818880","2822340"," Uh, is tech done with its correction?"
"2822420","2822820"," Right?"
"2822900","2824340"," It's the big question that's out there."
"2825900","2828580"," And we'll look at this on a one day chart that instead."
"2828580","2831780"," So we'll give you some context for what we mean here. "
"2834210","2839050"," And you've got, you know, you've got market participants like JPM that say, a matter of fact, Jamie"
"2839050","2842630"," Diamond said we were getting the next leg down."
"2842770","2844450"," Matter of fact, he predicted we'd get it."
"2844630","2850070"," I think he's predicted it a couple times, but currently he's saying we'll have our last leg of the"
"2850070","2852970"," bear market to one of 2023. "
"2854290","2856950"," No, I know there are bears out there that'll."
"2857450","2859810"," You've got some bears that are like, I agree with him."
"2860270","2863330"," And I assure you, if we get that leg down, they'll tell you that we're not going to. "
"2863330","2865770"," We're going to continue down to Q2 and Q3 to."
"2866430","2866950"," Right."
"2867330","2872830"," So we got Jamie Diamond out there at least saying Q1 will be the last leg. "
"2873250","2876970"," I believe that's what he's saying of the bear market."
"2876970","2881910"," And so his point being that we come down here."
"2882210","2886430"," We test the high here and then we continue one more, at least one more leg down. "
"2886550","2888670"," I guess if you were Jamie Diamond, it's not like that."
"2888810","2891730"," It looks more like, depending on which Elliott wave."
"2892370","2893710"," The person is counting. "
"2896070","2898410"," I guess I guess you're counting this one is one."
"2899190","2901890"," And that one is two, and then this one is three, right?"
"2902170","2903050"," That's my assumption."
"2904170","2905670"," That's what an Elliott way ever saying. "
"2907330","2910830"," This is what Jamie Diamond saying is to expect that last leg down."
"2911250","2912630"," Now, how do you get that last leg?"
"2912830","2916690"," Is the point and the question that's posed then if that's the case."
"2916710","2919970"," If this is it right here, we're getting our last leg down, let's say. "
"2922370","2924210"," That's a pretty, what is that 20 bucks?"
"2924430","2925250"," Let's go back up to 64."
"2925570","2925950"," How about that?"
"2926450","2927190"," This is Tesla."
"2929110","2931390"," Some of you all want Tesla fucking five bucks. "
"2933170","2936730"," Now, there's a claim that we have one more leg down in tech."
"2937030","2938370"," Most of tech looks like this."
"2939410","2941510"," And so here's the point that I make to you. "
"2942330","2943950"," We bought this down below, by the way."
"2945170","2946650"," We bought Tesla down here."
"2946650","2949930"," But the question becomes, where can you pick Tesla back up?"
"2950090","2955030"," But where do you have to, where do you have to hedge Tesla and that kind of stuff?"
"2955310","2957650"," So, and my point here is if you check this blue line. "
"2959350","2962950"," If you look at this blue line, it's kind of a no man's land, right?"
"2963370","2964010"," No woman's land."
"2965790","2966910"," I know you're asking."
"2967570","2972930"," And so the point here is you see this, you see this role here, right?"
"2973750","2978650"," If you're a bull, a Tesla bull, you don't want to see the beginnings of this role here. "
"2978770","2979630"," So I want you to see this here."
"2980870","2984930"," And so when I talk to you about where we close, stay the importance of where we close, stay the"
"2984930","2990250"," importance where the market closes, where spy closes, the direction of the market."
"2990930","2994710"," And these guys that I saw last night were like, hey, we can't pick the direction here. "
"2995010","2995970"," And I agree with those guys."
"2996710","2999630"," It's tough for me to call where the market's going to go from here."
"3000190","3005810"," You can only think you can really say here is we start trading below, right?"
"3006630","3009530"," And the monthly and weekly come over here. "
"3009850","3013190"," Yeah, we can call this as a, as the correction is not over on Tesla."
"3015090","3021490"," But if we do trade higher, we break above and we're able to defend the monthly."
"3022230","3027430"," You could start to talk about the correction being over for a little bit of time. "
"3027430","3029130"," That's if it holds and starts to go higher."
"3030030","3032050"," But otherwise, you're not getting caught in this."
"3032390","3033910"," You don't want, well, you can be caught in this. "
"3034270","3038750"," You can be, you can be long here stock, but you can't be on hedge."
"3039110","3045030"," And I think that's the key point here is if you are a long stock in this market, you have"
"3045030","3045430"," to be hedge."
"3045670","3046030"," You don't have a choice. "
"3047530","3049890"," Here's by cheap, cheap hedging, some kind of cheap hedging."
"3049950","3053010"," I don't care if it's like June, I don't care if it's like late March."
"3054330","3060550"," If you're long stock, this is the place to be hedged this market. "
"3063030","3070610"," This is fairly consistent with, this is fairly consistent with most other bangman plus D tickers,"
"3070610","3071850"," right where we are right here."
"3071990","3077910"," So if you are long here, I ended up selling at two, fourteen, I sold right in here somewhere, I"
"3077910","3078510"," think in here."
"3078510","3082770"," I don't think it was here, I don't remember, but it was somewhere in here, like two, fourteen, I"
"3082770","3083110"," ended up selling. "
"3083910","3085970"," Because I was buying hedging to hedge my positions."
"3087590","3090270"," And I'm like, you know, I'll just take the money and run."
"3090790","3095890"," And if we trade over and down to sixty four bucks, I'll create another position. "
"3096610","3102570"," If we trade above and hold to right now, it's currently two, twenty four."
"3103190","3105170"," If we can hold this and begin to move higher."
"3106210","3112530"," I'll add to a position, or I'll take a position in Tesla once again, above two twenty four. "
"3113130","3118930"," But if that doesn't happen, this is really not the place for me to be sticking around inside the"
"3118930","3119150"," market."
"3119310","3119750"," Does that make sense?"
"3120450","3123490"," So this should apply to you on any ticker."
"3123630","3128770"," You can just apply this to you on meadows, applies to an apple, it applies to you on Google. "
"3129650","3132190"," It doesn't, you pick it Netflix, they're all right there."
"3132190","3134230"," All the tech stocks are right there."
"3134630","3136210"," All the semis are right there. "
"3137790","3142410"," They're all there waiting to either roll over or make a next leg higher."
"3147700","3149620"," And that is the big question, right?"
"3150320","3151200"," That is the big question."
"3151440","3154800"," The big question is, if we are going to go higher, how high do we go?"
"3155800","3160700"," I don't think it's, I mean, I think the initial place is two twenty, but if we're going to go"
"3160700","3162860"," higher, why would it be just two twenty?"
"3162860","3167440"," If we're at three ninety seven, we're only going up two hundred points, probably not the case. "
"3168460","3173480"," The case would be probably for two thirty, maybe even higher at that point."
"3174380","3181960"," So if the, if the direction is down, it seems like the most, it seems like the most."
"3182960","3187060"," Like, or there's more money that money on the downside is my point, I guess. "
"3188220","3191760"," So on the downside, we could easily go to two thirty, or excuse me, three thirty."
"3192020","3196920"," And you're talking, you're talking, what do we got ahead of us, seven hundred points, right?"
"3197240","3200040"," Juice, big juice down there, big money down there to be made."
"3201220","3202820"," Can we go up seven hundred points?"
"3203920","3204600"," We can. "
"3206180","3210940"," That puts us, that puts us at, we're going to test the previous highs, right?"
"3211280","3212120"," That's what that's what it says."
"3212120","3214640"," So I think that's kind of where we are."
"3215180","3218660"," Is, hey, what's the least or path of least resistance?"
"3219700","3221660"," Are we going down six, seven hundred points?"
"3221800","3223260"," We're going up six, seven hundred points. "
"3223960","3226120"," I think that's the, that's the big question for you."
"3227120","3229320"," So let me know if you think that's the big question for the market."
"3230980","3232160"," And when does that happen?"
"3232360","3233040"," Does it happen now?"
"3233340","3234100"," Does it happen to you one?"
"3234640","3235700"," Does it happen in Q four?"
"3235820","3238480"," Does it happen in Q two, Q three?"
"3239580","3242120"," Marco, I think, is on that same camp as well. "
"3242260","3243800"," I think Mike Wilson's on that same camp."
"3244880","3248060"," I think I said it was, I think I said it was Jamie Diamond, but I think it was Mike"
"3248060","3248360"," Wilson."
"3248540","3249720"," They called for the third leg down. "
"3249880","3252240"," It could be, I think I got that, that wrong."
"3252460","3259800"," I think it was Mike Wilson that said, expect, expect the last bear, bear, bear leg down in Q one."
"3260020","3260900"," That doesn't happen yet, has it?"
"3262580","3264060"," We haven't had that in Q one yet. "
"3264280","3264860"," Where was it?"
"3264860","3266220"," Every 28th."
"3266420","3267600"," Talk is ticked."
"3267640","3269400"," The clock is ticking, Mike Wilson. "
"3270940","3272620"," The clock is ticking, bruh."
"3292340","3293280"," What are you saying here?"
"3293440","3295100"," LaCrusette puts a dent in the flooring."
"3296220","3297500"," I like LaCrusette. "
"3297680","3301000"," They make great pots and not pots, but they make great clay pots."
"3311290","3312670"," 27 was a year of clarity."
"3312990","3314450"," The whole world started to come into focus. "
"3315250","3316030"," Yeah, it makes sense."
"3317130","3317850"," It's in a month."
"3318110","3319250"," Yep, yep, in a month today. "
"3333740","3337500"," Yeah, when I met my wife, we took our time."
"3340280","3342940"," I think that's more common now than it was at one time."
"3343780","3345660"," I think people are waiting to get married. "
"3348460","3356060"," We'll bring that up for discussion today, too, because I had a conversation last night with Joe"
"3356060","3365780"," Donut about we talked about hoarding wealth."
"3369710","3378970"," And there's a fascinating difference in, there's a fascinating difference from the great financial"
"3378970","3380330"," crisis to today."
"3382790","3384870"," And we'll talk about that. "
"3385830","3389870"," As a matter of fact, like the boomer generation kind of started it."
"3390330","3395370"," And we'll discuss that this morning at some point."
"3396070","3399050"," And now this new generation of wealth hoarding that's taking place. "
"3400410","3400950"," They got theirs."
"3401210","3401690"," I'm going to get mine."
"3401690","3407230"," And I learned my lesson or I learned my lesson for my parents in the GFC. "
"3413390","3414910"," So we'll talk about that this morning, too."
"3434860","3436660"," Your ex-wife's family was fascinating."
"3437040","3438760"," Three sisters were all married by the time they were 24. "
"3439140","3444320"," Divorced by the time they were 20, including my ex-wife, or your ex-wife."
"3452070","3453250"," I don't know, man."
"3453430","3454270"," I got to be honest with you guys. "
"3454470","3458990"," If you're angry or butt-heard about women out there, no need to be."
"3460030","3461830"," I think that comes with age as well."
"3462050","3464050"," I think it's funny as I've gotten older. "
"3465830","3471830"," I've cared less and less about any of that stuff."
"3483850","3489170"," But when you're younger, I get that point."
"3501780","3504120"," I would be interested in divorce rates. "
"3504460","3509700"," I'm interested in, I feel like, I see people getting married or not."
"3509700","3509940"," I'm interested in, I feel like, I feel like I see people getting married or not."
"3509940","3511540"," I feel older or not younger. "
"3513120","3518780"," It being used more as a function of, well, we had some kids and so we got married or our"
"3518780","3519600"," taxes are better."
"3520460","3520760"," We got married."
"3521140","3523520"," I have a lot of friends that never got married. "
"3524800","3527740"," I see less and less of it than I saw when I was younger."
"3530260","3536960"," But I think part of that's a function of wealth, believe it or not, as two is wealth."
"3536960","3539300"," And do you have wealth or not have wealth?"
"3543340","3546660"," And then, of course, you have social media, too. "
"3548040","3553520"," The number of kids that are living, not even kids, the number of 30-year-olds living at home is"
"3553520","3554680"," outrageous right now."
"3555300","3556180"," It's not their fault."
"3557900","3560740"," This is a conversation that we had last night. "
"3561400","3570980"," We were talking about our own children and the discussion centered around their chances"
"3570980","3574300"," in life to build wealth or buy a home."
"3575380","3582860"," If you can't, we talked about when I was young, a parent could give you some money towards college"
"3582860","3586300"," and then some money to buy a home or at least start a home or."
"3586300","3592120"," Hey, here's 20 grand, here's 30 grand, here's 100 grand, and we'll help you get your starter home,"
"3592320","3593760"," your first home that you're going to move into. "
"3594020","3595360"," And it's just not the case right now."
"3596480","3600460"," You've got wealth hoarding going on in mass, and they're doing it."
"3600820","3608560"," The crazy part of a wealth hoarding is there is a, there is a, there is a, how would you"
"3608560","3608880"," say it?"
"3609780","3619520"," There's a, I want to call it a difference for a"
"3619520","3625120"," lesson learned by Main Street, Bob. "
"3627340","3637160"," So, my take on this is you had the boomer generation, these are people that grew up in the 50s,"
"3637200","3637940"," 60s."
"3639800","3642540"," 70s, they went through a crash in 87."
"3643380","3649640"," They went through the 2000 crash, they went through the 2008 crash, and they got really good at"
"3649640","3652220"," figuring out how not to lose their money. "
"3652960","3661260"," They learned valuable lessons about wealth and losing wealth and being washed out of a system"
"3661260","3663180"," multiple times."
"3663840","3668440"," So, they didn't make the same, they don't make the same mistakes a fourth time."
"3670140","3671500"," They got fourth time, right?"
"3671620","3674040"," They're like, we got this, we, we saw what happened. "
"3674880","3679340"," Then you also have this generation where there's a larger disconnect between them and younger"
"3679340","3679860"," people."
"3682160","3683240"," Generational, just a generate."
"3683460","3684980"," Matter of fact, I just watched a documentary on this. "
"3685680","3692720"," It was on vice, they know it's about a community in Florida with this generation, and they're like,"
"3692720","3693980"," hey, my kids don't talk to me."
"3694480","3695920"," We see our kids once a year."
"3696360","3698480"," Our kids and I talk on the phone. "
"3699260","3702460"," We have a generational difference of opinion."
"3702720","3709540"," And this is fascinating too, because this was the first generation in the United States that didn't"
"3709540","3711740"," grow old with their children."
"3712480","3717340"," Prior to this generation, they even, and this documentary is really fascinating because these"
"3717340","3724380"," people say, hey, look, my, my aunt's and uncles, my grandparents, my great, great this, my great,"
"3724540","3727640"," great that they were all taken care of at home and to their older age. "
"3728200","3729860"," And they pretty much just sat around."
"3730100","3730680"," They didn't do much."
"3731440","3735760"," And these boomers, real boomers are like, but we've had better healthcare. "
"3736020","3737080"," We've taken care of ourselves."
"3737800","3739620"," And we've been more active in our lives."
"3740040","3742980"," And so we're off enjoying our later years. "
"3743900","3748760"," So we dance and we go to bars and we go, we live in these communities and we sail and"
"3748760","3752300"," we play golf and we do all this crazy shit shooting guns at the gun range."
"3753640","3755280"," And so they're active."
"3755640","3757540"," And this was the first generation being active. "
"3758380","3762060"," The first older generation in the United States was fascinating too, because in this documentary"
"3762060","3765040"," they talk about how if you're from another country, Europe."
"3766500","3769780"," Older generations are still rolled into younger generations."
"3770000","3775820"," There isn't a, there isn't a generational break as of yet. "
"3776580","3781580"," Parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, they're still, they're still in that same system of"
"3781580","3782980"," connection."
"3784300","3785920"," But in the United States, that's not the case."
"3787680","3796720"," Now this generation learned their lessons supposedly for not losing wealth through many market"
"3796720","3799460"," crashes, housing crashes, stuff like that. "
"3799620","3800740"," And they are hoarding wealth."
"3802360","3805960"," And, uh, so I was talking to my buddy Joe last night and I was like, you know what?"
"3806100","3812300"," I was like, when I was young, my father bought homes and renovated them."
"3813020","3820220"," And, uh, his peers at that time, uh, with leverage money. "
"3820900","3823620"," They, they leveraged everything was leveraged on credit."
"3823920","3827240"," Everything was leveraged on, uh, who cares down the road?"
"3827340","3829240"," If he's be great, it makes so much money."
"3829240","3834080"," And then of course you go through these crashes and specifically another big one was the housing"
"3834080","3834380"," crash. "
"3835980","3837360"," People lost everything, right?"
"3837520","3841560"," Didn't matter if you were, didn't matter if you had great credit, didn't matter if you did"
"3841560","3842040"," everything right."
"3842840","3849360"," It didn't matter even if you weren't feeling the pain in your own financing because the entire"
"3849360","3850260"," neighborhood was empty."
"3850540","3851700"," So let's say you paid your bills. "
"3852000","3853280"," It didn't matter if you paid your bills."
"3853860","3855100"," Your neighbors didn't pay their bills."
"3855100","3857840"," So you kind of got crushed. "
"3858840","3866280"," And the reason I bring this up is because the past decade that I've spent, uh, renovating homes."
"3867640","3871600"," Almost everyone in these groups that I'm in, uh, they did it with cash."
"3872780","3874680"," None of these people have leveraged themselves. "
"3875320","3879040"," All of these, all of these like new generation of, um, of renovators."
"3880020","3886340"," They literally, they literally, they did a few of these deals where, um, we take someone else's"
"3886340","3890900"," money, but as soon as they could, they were into their own money, no loans, no mortgages."
"3891580","3895200"," Now some of these guys will mortgage out homes for leverage and other things. "
"3895380","3899780"," They do that stuff still, but most of the people that I know, it's all cash."
"3900720","3901700"," They buy their homes of cash."
"3902040","3904040"," They renovate them with cash. "
"3904500","3909120"," And that's that next step of, uh, wealth hoarding is my point here."
"3910560","3916020"," And to that point, there are young generations that are saying, I'm never going to get a leg up."
"3917280","3921820"," Uh, they're young people that are like, well, am I going to be able to just, can my father or"
"3921820","3926680"," mother, uh, give me a loan for 20 grand or 100 grand to get into my first home?"
"3927340","3928860"," Uh, will I ever be able to catch up?"
"3929040","3933780"," Will there be a housing crisis that'll hurt, uh, these older generations that takes away?"
"3933780","3935260"," This bad debt from these people. "
"3935860","3941600"," And my point to him was my point to my friend last night was, I don't know if that, if"
"3941600","3944040"," there's an answer to that, I think there's some of that that'll take place."
"3945400","3949040"," Uh, but truthfully, a lot of these older generations are now hoarding wealth."
"3949880","3952820"," Uh, they're not, uh, mis-managing some of this wealth. "
"3953540","3956180"," They can actually take some of that pain."
"3956660","3961140"," And, uh, there is an implication somewhere."
"3961140","3969960"," Uh, there's, I'll tell it to you, but you can see it, like Black Rock is building rental homes, or"
"3969960","3972120"," they stop, but they were last couple of years. "
"3972820","3976540"," Uh, and the reason that they're building these rental homes is because some very smart people are"
"3976540","3983960"," saying, hey, like, uh, we might not have available housing for younger people."
"3983960","3986740"," There will be, continue to be a housing shortage."
"3987660","3992540"," Uh, some of this generational wealth is going to hoard or have been hoarding, uh, their wealth,"
"3992540","3995260"," whether or not going to lose it or feel that the pain. "
"3995540","4001760"," And not surprisingly, uh, you saw articles last week about the housing market, how it's as worse as"
"4001760","4006440"," it, as it was in the last crash, great, the great financial crash, right?"
"4006620","4007640"," Great housing crash that we had."
"4007640","4012540"," And my point to my friend last night was, look, I haven't felt any of that."
"4013320","4017980"," Uh, the homes that I own, uh, I bought them when they were worthless. "
"4018220","4026140"," Not worthless, but, uh, before this massive increase in housing prices, uh, you should see which"
"4026140","4028100"," most of these people are into their homes."
"4028680","4033180"," You'll go to a community and you'll see a home that's like 500,000 or even a million dollars, 800 "
"4033180","4034080",",000 dollars."
"4034720","4038920"," A lot of people bought those homes when they were like $150,000, right?"
"4039160","4043080"," So, like, let's say at the height of the housing market, you get a million dollar home and now"
"4043080","4047300"," they're $800,000, they're still only into them for 150. "
"4049240","4053100"," Uh, so the question becomes, uh, do they ever lose that home?"
"4053320","4054780"," Do they ever, are they ever going to lose that home?"
"4054920","4059780"," So I guess some people will, if they have bad debt or they have second, third mortgages, but a huge"
"4059780","4061940"," part of our, our, our society."
"4061940","4069260"," Uh, that the gap between, uh, where we are at the housing market right now, where they actually are"
"4069260","4071440"," in, in two for these homes is, is vast."
"4072560","4075040"," Um, so the question becomes, do they lose those homes?"
"4075060","4076140"," Do they not lose those homes?"
"4076500","4080940"," Is there a way to wash those people out so we can, uh, that's how our system works, right?"
"4080940","4087480"," Short, long term debt cycles, you wash out, uh, older, older, or older generations of people and"
"4087480","4094220"," open up, uh, open up, uh, opportunity for younger, younger people take on debt, right?"
"4094440","4099060"," To create something good, wonderful, um, for themselves and for society. "
"4099620","4102300"," And, uh, those are big discussion last night."
"4102920","4105680"," Uh, was, will they have, will this next generation have that opportunity?"
"4106040","4107140"," Right now we're not seeing it."
"4107640","4112479"," You can see, uh, that the rate of, I think it's 50% of 30 year olds are still living"
"4112479","4114319"," at home, uh, with a parent. "
"4114920","4116319"," That's a huge number."
"4117080","4118200"," I looked it up right now."
"4134840","4140180"," So right here, 52% of young adults in the US are living with their parents. "
"4140240","4142220"," That is astounding."
"4143680","4149220"," Us down, an astounding, uh, figure for 52% of young adults living at home."
"4150300","4151300"," Uh, with their parents. "
"4151439","4151920"," That's a big number."
"4152220","4153120"," I wouldn't expect that."
"4153500","4156240"," And, and it's weird is that we were our discussion last night. "
"4157359","4160479"," I, people are screaming and I'm like, you know, I was like, you know what?"
"4160740","4161779"," I was like, Joe, I gotta tell you something."
"4162279","4168140"," I was like, people are screaming about the high cost of housing and they're screaming about not"
"4168140","4169939"," being able to get in, but who are those people?"
"4169939","4171979"," They're not older people."
"4172399","4173200"," They're younger people. "
"4173399","4173880"," That's who they are."
"4174779","4176040"," Uh, they're, they're complaining."
"4176819","4183060"," Uh, older people are not feeling, uh, the crunch or the squeeze that's, that's happening. "
"4183060","4183819"," And you can see it."
"4184460","4185960"," Uh, pure research right here."
"4187600","4192520"," Uh, the majority of young adults in the US live with their parents for the first time since the"
"4192520","4193380"," Great Depression. "
"4194260","4195960"," Um, it's wild."
"4196820","4197820"," Unreal to read this stuff."
"4199120","4200440"," I'm reading through it right now. "
"4200620","4203280"," Like, so you're talking about kids today."
"4204020","4206180"," Uh, they have less opportunity."
"4206640","4208000"," And even if they get a degree. "
"4208940","4214000"," Even if they're making $90,000 a year, let's say they get an entry level job at 60,000 or"
"4214000","4214620"," 90,000."
"4215040","4217980"," That they ain't getting far with with it."
"4220950","4227630"," Now, not with where rates are for, for mortgages, insurance, down payments, uh, decent"
"4227630","4229010"," neighborhood, any of that kind of stuff. "
"4243190","4245890"," Everybody's too busy chasing careers to take care of parents."
"4246970","4248930"," Uh, yeah, you just, uh, documentary."
"4249310","4251190"," I don't know what the name of it is, but it's on vice. "
"4251550","4252870"," You should, it's fascinating to watch."
"4253790","4256990"," Uh, talks about a disconnect between a generational disconnect."
"4258550","4261130"," Now, between this first active, older generation. "
"4277720","4280740"," Yeah, I'll have my, our property taxes are going through the roof right now too."
"4283060","4287380"," All of our taxes are going, all of our, they're, they're, they're squeezing us as best they can."
"4288080","4289460"," I don't know how some people do it. "
"4290080","4293260"," And we were talking about, so John and I last time we're talking about not just the mortgage."
"4293260","4297260"," If you're not, if you don't already own a home, it's different."
"4297660","4301780"," If you own a home and you're like, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to downsize or I'm going to"
"4301780","4303840"," go and buy this overpriced home. "
"4303840","4308520"," You, you already have some equity, uh, in a previous home, but if you're a first time home buyer"
"4308520","4310180"," and you've got no equity, it's brutal."
"4310660","4313440"," And then you're talking about a, we're talking about mortgages last night."
"4313440","4315440"," We were like, this is a $5,000 mortgage. "
"4316960","4319380"," Do you make five grand after taxes every month?"
"4319500","4323180"," You get, you get, you make the money back in end of year, but do you make five grand to"
"4323180","4326000"," spend every month on a mortgage and insurance?"
"4326780","4327720"," I want to know taxes."
"4328720","4333120"," Do you have another thousand bucks for food every month?"
"4333340","4334580"," You have money to go out every month."
"4335240","4339860"," You have money to replace your furnace if you need to or a roof. "
"4341020","4345020"," Do you have an extra 70 K line around to renovate a kitchen?"
"4346060","4347220"," How about if you get hurt?"
"4347960","4352940"," What about your car payments or two car payments for you and your husband, right?"
"4353220","4360060"," You like, can I afford two cars payments, insurance on those vehicles, repairs on those vehicles,"
"4360980","4363360"," gas or electric if you're charging a vehicle?"
"4364320","4365800"," What does that cost every year?"
"4366600","4367320"," It's ridiculous."
"4367320","4368040"," What it costs?"
"4368660","4369920"," It's absolutely, it's absolutely ridiculous."
"4370420","4371960"," Medical insurance, dental insurance. "
"4373320","4375200"," You've got a dog or something, Fido."
"4376120","4377360"," What does that cost every month?"
"4378540","4379640"," Start counting it up."
"4379640","4380360"," It's, it's brutal. "
"4381300","4382300"," You're going to make serious money."
"4382960","4385440"," You're not making like 300 plus every year."
"4385560","4387200"," The U.S. itself, $75 billion. "
"4387640","4388760"," You're a fairly straight buy."
"4389140","4391020"," Second settling on the March 7th."
"4399410","4401050"," She is sneaking it sick into your phone. "
"4401350","4402570"," I don't think that girls care."
"4403670","4406530"," I would assume that women don't care or men at this point."
"4406690","4410130"," Young people are probably like, sweet, I'm living at home. "
"4411810","4413250"," They might look at that as a good thing."
"4413350","4413630"," I don't know."
"4413950","4419120"," I don't know if they do or don't, but a little bit of a squeeze here. "
"4419500","4421240"," Yeah, we know VIX is telling the other story."
"4421440","4422900"," We know they're pinning this market right now."
"4428620","4430420"," They're trying to pin this market right now. "
"4430420","4433380"," We know that price is not reflected where it should be."
"4433420","4434700"," We saw it yesterday as well."
"4435560","4437340"," We saw tech stocks ripping. "
"4437420","4446480"," We saw HYG ripping and we saw the spy just pinned yesterday and a month."
"4453500","4455980"," You're facing the same stuff in your country as well."
"4457860","4459800"," Which stuff are you facing in your country?"
"4463120","4464400"," Let me know what a..."
"4464400","4464800"," Oh, hold on. "
"4464900","4466420"," I'm going to get my camera back on."
"4492180","4500480"," If you're not from the United States, are you dealing with generational..."
"4500480","4505720"," or are you dealing with any kind of generational stuff or is it housing stuff?"
"4508000","4509760"," Let me just scroll over here."
"4516310","4517990"," My calls are still fine, man. "
"4518110","4519510"," They're at 93 cents right now."
"4521850","4523530"," They're weathering this right now."
"4523790","4524770"," They're weathering the up and down. "
"4525910","4527390"," I have a feeling right now."
"4527590","4529290"," If you're out there and you're a zero-date trader."
"4529290","4539130"," I think there's an intent to murder zero dates or there's definitely some kind of bots"
"4539130","4542270"," out there that are trading this microscope right now. "
"4554210","4556850"," I think what you're saying is they have a ton of equity."
"4557150","4557590"," Yes, they do."
"4558350","4559750"," I think what they..."
"4559750","4567330"," My posit here is that you've got older generations that learned their lessons. "
"4568810","4569950"," With bad debt."
"4570390","4576790"," And now they're hoarding this wealth and they're not transferring it to younger generations."
"4577810","4579970"," They're deciding what they do with it. "
"4581970","4584190"," And they have a grip on it until they die."
"4584650","4586750"," And then we've got to disconnect between their next generation."
"4586750","4588230"," This would be..."
"4588230","4592070"," What would you call the next generation after the boomers would be Gen X?"
"4593630","4600210"," I forget the name of each generation of people, but basically you've got like 30 to 50 year olds. "
"4602290","4605210"," That are learning these same lessons, right?"
"4606370","4608390"," And these are people that have bought in the past decade."
"4609470","4611490"," And they're wiser with their own money."
"4612270","4613690"," So they're not giving it up. "
"4614830","4616650"," And now you're compounding this."
"4617590","4618910"," Into a young generation."
"4618910","4620670"," Let's say they're 30 and younger. "
"4627050","4627690"," Hold on."
"4627750","4629930"," I'm getting blown up here via text message."
"4633250","4636110"," So someone's showing me I'm getting a text message just here. "
"4636250","4636310"," Ready?"
"4638510","4639750"," Hold on a second here."
"4642630","4645090"," Let's tell you."
"4645210","4647130"," An average home price now. "
"4647510","4648950"," This is someone's texting me this right now."
"4649750","4651290"," Average home price right now."
"4651290","4653750"," $535,000. "
"4654690","4656870"," And $535,80."
"4657210","4657630"," Or $800."
"4658490","4659090"," Excuse me. "
"4659330","4661170"," Basically a half million dollars, right?"
"4661290","4662130"," A little bit more than a half million."
"4663410","4665170"," $540,000, right?"
"4666350","4666710"," You ready?"
"4666950","4676130"," Your payment every month is $4,610 on an FHA loan with 5% down."
"4677370","4679290"," This is what this looks like. "
"4679290","4684370"," $6.5%. Your note is $4,610."
"4688270","4689790"," That's just your mortgage."
"4690570","4692050"," $4,600. "
"4694190","4695030"," Every month."
"4696050","4697710"," So let's say you're a single person."
"4698690","4699270"," And you pay. "
"4701410","4702750"," This is insane."
"4702750","4702990"," This is insane."
"4706070","4710990"," If you're a young person and you're watching this broadcast, I feel so bad for you. "
"4711930","4712730"," I really do."
"4712990","4714750"," I can't say that I don't feel."
"4715130","4718070"," I can't say that I don't have sympathy for a young person. "
"4719050","4719790"," Can you imagine?"
"4719790","4722450"," Can you imagine being young and being told?"
"4723850","4727070"," The top US tip of the mat for East Asia, Daniel."
"4727910","4732790"," There's a many US partners have shared US concerns about China, considering providing lethal"
"4732790","4734870"," assistance to Russia's war in Ukraine."
"4736210","4738570"," A buddy of mine has a buddy of mine has a."
"4739570","4742110"," He's saying that that's 55 K a year. "
"4743290","4746190"," A good friend of mine has a bunch of degrees."
"4746210","4747990"," This guy's really smart, right?"
"4748210","4748510"," Ticksright."
"4749010","4753530"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear order flame futures, forex and stock instruments. "
"4753530","4755630"," He worked for a big tech company."
"4755750","4756110"," Ticksright."
"4756250","4756590"," Don't come. "
"4761840","4762780"," And he's single."
"4762940","4763400"," No married."
"4763640","4763880"," No kids. "
"4764120","4764500"," No nothing."
"4765840","4767920"," And when I talk to him, he tells me."
"4768540","4769820"," He goes, bro, I'm poor. "
"4770420","4772720"," He goes, I'm poor."
"4773100","4773640"," Like, who do you live with?"
"4773820","4774580"," Like, I live with my parents."
"4775720","4776680"," I'm like, how much money?"
"4776920","4780100"," As a matter of fact, he's like, I just paid off my, it was like this month, I just finished"
"4780100","4781080"," paying off my student loans. "
"4781840","4783640"," Because I think I have $30 left to my name."
"4785100","4790620"," We're not even talking about the other 55 K that he needs to just get into an entry starter home."
"4791840","4795340"," Like a middle of the road average price home. "
"4796040","4797880"," He can't even afford like five grand."
"4798480","4800340"," Who has 5,000 just taking around every month?"
"4801900","4803800"," People do, but not many."
"4805260","4808260"," Most of your entry level jobs, are they paying what?"
"4808480","4810380"," Maybe 60,000, 40,000 a year. "
"4811180","4813840"," You've got teachers, some teachers making 30 K a year."
"4816120","4819200"," Not even into like your food yet, your car, your insurance."
"4820420","4821400"," Rainy day fund. "
"4822280","4825140"," Joe Donut was saying that he went to a Starbucks."
"4827120","4829760"," And that Starbucks does a very good job."
"4829940","4833600"," It's like a Costco in terms of a retail job that pays well, you get good benefits. "
"4834860","4838840"," And they're friendly with the people in there and he's like one of him and one of his friends asked"
"4838840","4841320"," somebody in there or the workers."
"4841320","4843540"," Hey, if you could, if you needed 500 bucks today."
"4845160","4847080"," If you needed $500 today. "
"4848060","4853500"," Like right now, could you pull it out of the bank and it was of all the workers there."
"4853500","4855840"," There was a very small percentage."
"4856560","4862700"," Like 15% I think had been up to 30, but it was like 15 to 30%, could find $500. "
"4863460","4866340"," And of that 15 to 30%, they were borrowing it."
"4866820","4871160"," No, they couldn't just go to their bank and pull out 500 bucks and be like, I need 500."
"4871340","4872820"," I don't know if it's 500 or 1500. "
"4873500","4876420"," The Joe, it's the maybe he'll talk in the chat and tell us in the chat."
"4877740","4879120"," What the actual numbers were."
"4880240","4882900"," But it's not, it's not easy being young. "
"4891100","4892040"," What are you saying here?"
"4892100","4896560"," I don't want everything to collapse just so that I can have a basic a basic come or something."
"4896760","4897320"," I don't know what that means."
"4897640","4898380"," Basic home. "
"4898700","4901860"," That is more than all my monthly expenses combined."
"4904240","4907560"," It's also better for young and duration, wealth gap destroys society."
"4910400","4914660"," The only thing that I would say if you're young is the only thing I would say if you're young"
"4914660","4914980"," is. "
"4916120","4921500"," One thing that I don't see talk about too often I brought that up in the broadcast before is if"
"4921500","4922700"," you are young and you're listening."
"4924400","4927020"," You should be looking for places to live that are cheaper."
"4927640","4930060"," That's one of the only things I see sometimes is. "
"4933520","4938260"," I'll see young people that will say like, I want to live in LA or I want to live in"
"4938260","4939200"," Santa Monica."
"4939360","4939900"," I want to live in Vale."
"4940220","4942160"," I want to live in Park City or I want to live in New York City. "
"4942640","4943820"," I want to live in Boston."
"4944060","4944680"," I want to live on the beach."
"4945100","4949080"," I want to live in, I don't know, some beautiful island or something like that. "
"4949260","4957440"," No, honestly, you probably have to find a community that's up and coming and become a part of"
"4957440","4958280"," growing that community."
"4959980","4964180"," Somewhere that you think you might or you might think, well, I don't want to be a part of that"
"4964180","4964580"," community."
"4965360","4969380"," But you might have to move somewhere there and create something in that community. "
"4971060","4973280"," We're going to start squeezing this or what?"
"4977880","4980240"," My eyes are bleeding watching this right now."
"4983420","4987720"," I'm down 17 cents on my calls."
"5002040","5005960"," And I'm fascinatingly enough. "
"5006440","5009360"," I'm on 400 C for the first."
"5009360","5017160"," And the auto bots have moved to 398 C."
"5017560","5021700"," There's now 50,000 calls on 398 C for March 1st."
"5022960","5025360"," And those are $1.92 currently. "
"5039640","5042460"," I bought calls yesterday at the bell."
"5044570","5045760"," I'm on March 1st."
"5045760","5050600"," Yesterday, I was trying to wrap my head around zero dates yesterday. "
"5050880","5056200"," And I was looking back after this was before the bell and then after the bell."
"5056800","5060820"," I called some friends up yesterday and we were discussing zero dates."
"5061180","5065200"," And I was like, man, I was like, I am usually spot on with zero dates. "
"5065700","5067260"," And the past couple of weeks."
"5069680","5073780"," I'm feeling like it's too much under the microscope publicly."
"5074440","5075920"," Talked about everywhere right now. "
"5076600","5083000"," So I think too many people or people are running bots on zero dates right now or tracking what they"
"5083000","5083180"," are."
"5083540","5089140"," I was looking at my trades from last week and my trade at the end of the day yesterday is"
"5089140","5089920"," still holding up."
"5091180","5096000"," So a couple of days later in strike has been doing much better than zero dates for me. "
"5096840","5102800"," So if I have to adjust my my training, I will until until those people go away."
"5111240","5113100"," Now, some still long calls right now."
"5113760","5118120"," I will sell calls after the open if they're printing, but if they're not, I hold them. "
"5118900","5119600"," That's my rule."
"5119680","5120780"," That's like one of my rules, man."
"5121020","5121840"," I don't hold calls. "
"5122260","5127200"," So if I buy calls like one dates for tomorrow and I hold them overnight."
"5127640","5130840"," If I'm in the money or making money, I take the money right off the bell."
"5130840","5133760"," But if they're losing money or not up, I hold on to them. "
"5135040","5136900"," I'm adjusting my trading right now."
"5142840","5152440"," I've been trading zero dates every day for a long, long time, many years."
"5153280","5157940"," And I'm in the options chain every single day on the on the spot every single day. "
"5158800","5162420"," I see the changes that have come in to the market."
"5164060","5165620"," And into zero day market."
"5167720","5169660"," And specifically the past two weeks. "
"5171820","5172980"," I've had to adjust my trading."
"5174800","5178600"," And it's very rare that I have to adjust my serenade trading."
"5182180","5185000"," I can assign some of this probably to end a month, but. "
"5188200","5190680"," We might have to in stream at least."
"5193720","5197300"," We may have to adjust how we talk about what we're trading."
"5198620","5204440"," If there are if there is anybody watching this broadcast or tracking on social media. "
"5205200","5209880"," I might have to change how we how we discuss what we're trading."
"5212600","5213760"," Some way to."
"5217280","5218900"," Spoof or like spoof. "
"5219920","5223200"," Anyone that's watching bots, possibly stuff like that."
"5233180","5234540"," Yeah, it has been off the charts."
"5240040","5243300"," Refresh chat, make sure update with what you guys are talking about. "
"5248380","5250640"," February is to close green."
"5250920","5253000"," We'll have to explode to the upside above four or six."
"5253420","5254380"," It's not even that high. "
"5255780","5258980"," So last Thursday was four or eight, four, ten."
"5259740","5261160"," So whom is saying."
"5262780","5266780"," If February is to close green, we will have to explode to the upside above four or six. "
"5267380","5270020"," So Thursday, I made a post on at captain's alpha."
"5271160","5273820"," And then I talked about four or eight, four, ten."
"5274000","5275560"," It's actually come down since then. "
"5276120","5277620"," I meant to bring that up this morning."
"5280770","5281970"," It's now down."
"5283010","5284230"," It's now down to. "
"5287230","5288890"," Four or two, sixty one."
"5289550","5291470"," So I should talk about this today."
"5292310","5293650"," And all truthfulness. "
"5303420","5304900"," This target right here."
"5309960","5314190"," If they get here."
"5328560","5329900"," It was four or eight. "
"5329920","5330560"," Now it's lower."
"5332120","5333420"," But if we hold above."
"5339180","5340100"," Hey, what's up, buddy?"
"5341260","5341720"," Henry. "
"5342880","5343260"," Say hi, buddy."
"5343920","5345400"," My dog's coming in to say hi."
"5346340","5346840"," Checking in on me. "
"5348520","5349960"," If we hold above."
"5355940","5357680"," Four or two, sixty seven."
"5365320","5366380"," Very bullish. "
"5367760","5368360"," Bullish."
"5372300","5373880"," Four or two, sixty seven."
"5374020","5375180"," That's the magic number right now. "
"5376020","5378420"," It was it was higher."
"5379660","5382940"," That's the number that sellers do not want us getting above."
"5384040","5389900"," So according to the EIA, US product supplied of crude and petroleum products fell in December to"
"5389900","5392400"," nineteen sport four nine million barrels per day. "
"5392760","5394820"," That's the lowest in March, twenty twenty one."
"5398500","5400600"," Calls are doing much better right now."
"5403140","5404740"," We have the gap above. "
"5405220","5407780"," We got a little gap here at three ninety eight ninety three."

"5444120","5447280"," Trying to break free of the Swellers up here."
"5449720","5451280"," They look like they're gone now."
"5451400","5453180"," The sellers look like they're gone at this point. "
"5460380","5461520"," Change this one to yellow."
"5470430","5471670"," Swellers with a little bit less."
"5478460","5480860"," Young Jim bras smashed through those guys. "
"5483040","5484200"," We want to hold."
"5493240","5497300"," Remember before we got sent down below right when we rolled right here."
"5497820","5502420"," Big old role right here down to three blasted down came back up. "
"5503100","5506040"," We want to hold this area right here three ninety seven."

"5530160","5533140"," This is where the bulls were robbed this morning."
"5534460","5539240"," This is where I was robbed of my calls this morning that I need to get paid on."
"5549080","5550100"," Put up a paywall. "
"5550340","5551980"," I think I think that's part of it."
"5554700","5557700"," Legend X to two X is saying cap put up a paywall."
"5557840","5560380"," You're not are not just making calls for educating every day. "
"5560460","5561580"," You deserve to reward in such a way."
"5562400","5563020"," You know what?"
"5563200","5564280"," There's two things here."
"5564620","5566200"," Well, there's another aspect to this. "
"5567280","5569660"," Which is if you put up a paywall."
"5572360","5573940"," So we can do is this."
"5575340","5576720"," So you can leave it. "
"5577340","5582780"," What you can do is this is to keep out nefarious individuals."
"5584180","5586480"," It was just two parts of this."
"5587000","5592900"," The first part is you can do something structured where. "
"5593640","5595480"," You have free right."
"5597080","5597960"," You got free."
"5600020","5601620"," And the free stuff. "
"5602700","5605560"," You kind of you're left with kind of figuring it out on your own."
"5607100","5608580"," We're just not as direct."
"5609140","5609220"," Right. "
"5609520","5610440"," So it's just free."
"5610880","5612260"," So an example would be this."
"5614240","5615360"," How do you make free?"
"5615960","5617760"," You I would hide this right here. "
"5620040","5621520"," I would hide that."
"5622040","5626420"," And so you'd only see me draw boxes and say buy this down here."
"5626420","5627720"," Watch out for this over here. "
"5628600","5631800"," And our target above is right here."
"5632120","5632220"," Right."
"5634680","5636600"," And that's all you would see publicly. "
"5637700","5639220"," And then if you paid a small fee."
"5641120","5642220"," You would be then given the blueprint."
"5643020","5644460"," You would actually get the tools. "
"5646040","5647900"," So that you would have the tools at home."
"5649240","5650760"," So you'd only see this publicly."
"5652080","5654500"," But you're in your office or at home and you would see. "
"5655700","5657640"," The actual tools behind this."
"5659380","5661700"," So you'd be like yeah I know exactly where we are."
"5662060","5663660"," I'm drawing the boxes in the same places. "
"5664420","5665600"," I've got the same tools."
"5666660","5667020"," At home."
"5667320","5667380"," Right. "
"5667680","5670840"," So then no one's watching what you're doing right publicly."
"5671180","5671860"," They're not able to see."
"5674020","5677880"," Now there's probably another group of people that are like well I don't care about all these tools. "
"5678360","5680120"," I want it told to me."
"5681820","5687680"," I just want someone to send me a text that says we just had a bull's cross right there."
"5689260","5689740"," Right. "
"5690120","5694720"," So someone else will just get a text alert that says we just had a bull's cross."
"5695100","5697440"," We're likely going to this number right here."
"5698200","5698540"," Right. "
"5698540","5701180"," So you have a third way to see this."
"5701720","5702740"," But it's not public."
"5705220","5708800"," Now that last group of people here that should cost money. "
"5709820","5711720"," That kind of data costs a ton of money."
"5712080","5713140"," So they're going to have to pay for that."
"5714360","5717040"," So I think that's part of the transition at this point. "
"5717920","5719360"," You are right to some extent."
"5720340","5720720"," Legend."
"5730960","5735180"," Yeah, there's like so I was talking with one of my friends last night. "
"5735260","5737160"," He was like, do you think there's an impact in the market?"
"5737200","5737700"," I said, yeah."
"5738360","5741160"," I said, I said, if you think I was like, if you think about it."
"5742500","5746100"," I was like, uh, I was like, normally I would say no. "
"5747240","5749840"," But I think here where we are."
"5751740","5756300"," If I'm trading him, if you're trading him, if people aren't talking about it, you've got people on."
"5756300","5756760"," Everywhere. "
"5757360","5758440"," Talking about zero dates."
"5759280","5761100"," You have the CEOs of banks."
"5762700","5764460"," Talking about trading zero dates. "
"5765020","5767860"," So you've got everyone's focused on zero dates."
"5769980","5773440"," And so the easiest thing to do is go out there and find people that trade zero dates and say."
"5774300","5775100"," How are they positioned?"
"5778000","5780780"," And you know, we got how many people got watching this stuff?"
"5780960","5781460"," We probably have. "
"5781780","5784720"," I know the perfect that we have people that are streaming this stream."
"5785360","5786920"," We've been told in chat."
"5787380","5791340"," Hey, do you mind if I restream this on my blog or if I restream this here or there?"
"5791800","5793760"," You know, this broadcast is more than likely on. "
"5795120","5797800"," Publicly, uh, not publicly, but in a room with other traders."
"5798660","5802720"," Um, so then you, then you figure out, uh, you're disseminating this, then you disseminating."
"5803520","5807600"," For people post publicly on Twitter, or maybe even you're posting something on Twitter. "
"5808180","5811880"," And then, you know, you've got all these other people that are, that are following along on that"
"5811880","5812160"," stuff."
"5813000","5816880"," So I think that at some point it just becomes, uh, you have to kind of put something up."
"5817000","5818180"," Just be like, nope, you know what?"
"5819120","5824480"," Uh, we're going to, we're going to try to get some of that in trying to cut out some of"
"5824480","5828460"," the, uh, some of the public, public information. "
"5838700","5840660"," What do you guys call this here, a dragon?"
"5840680","5843720"," U.S. natural gas features extended losses down by five percent."
"5845000","5847140"," What are you going to call this, like a green dragon down here?"
"5847620","5848120"," Well, let's take it here."
"5857370","5859130"," We've got the dragons tail down here. "
"5859310","5861230"," We've got his legs, his gnarly feet."
"5862290","5863550"," Coming on down here."
"5863710","5864990"," There's got his other foot down here. "
"5867250","5869670"," He's going to do his little raw all over here."
"5873990","5875250"," Got his little head over here."
"5877110","5880830"," Got some nasty, he's got some nasty kind of growth back there. "
"5881250","5882150"," Girlfriend doesn't like that."
"5882910","5884810"," He doesn't shave his, uh, his hump off."
"5886490","5888890"," There's a little like, a little grower going on right here. "
"5891010","5892010"," He's right over here."
"5895270","5896290"," He's kind of hungry."
"5899940","5902460"," Got a little, a little chin down here. "
"5904260","5905920"," He's spitting out fire up here."
"5910380","5910880"," Terrible."
"5912920","5913820"," Absolutely terrible. "
"5921670","5925850"," Now trading off the one minute, we'll see if we trade back to the five to check."
"5927130","5928850"," Getting bullish on the hourly here."
"5929190","5931910"," We have a little bit of strength in the market. "
"5933410","5934670"," We're going to see if this holds."
"5934950","5938910"," If we can get a come out of negativity and into positivity on the hourly."
"5945800","5947500"," We're in the same place right now. "
"5947520","5951800"," We've got a one, two, three, four trigger cluster currently on the spy."
"5952160","5953880"," We'll see if it can hold up and squeeze here."
"5954640","5956420"," I'm going to show you guys where we are. "
"5958220","5960920"," And we should setting up for a squeeze."
"5961220","5964800"," At least we've got a one, two, three, four."
"5965220","5968100"," If we can break above right now, we should explode higher. "
"5968320","5971160"," Three ninety six, sixteen is the magic number."
"5971860","5975580"," Three ninety eight, sixteen for this squeeze higher."
"5975800","5976260"," If we can get it. "
"5978740","5980400"," We're going to get rid of the swellers here."
"5980720","5982040"," I'm going to give you a quick line to look at."
"5982700","5985440"," Kind of beating through them at this point. "
"5987860","5990180"," Three ninety eight, sixteen is the trigger."
"6001920","6003100"," Trigger right here."
"6019400","6022860"," Need a trade above and hold that yellow line and we'll get a squeeze. "
"6033740","6035400"," It kept the jukaso."
"6038500","6039540"," All right."
"6039740","6042200"," I'm going to be looking at some zero dates. "
"6042820","6044960"," Going back to my gambling habit."
"6045200","6048280"," Let's get on February 28th."
"6048280","6049720"," Three ninety nine C."
"6051980","6053240"," Trading fifty nine cents. "
"6061410","6063310"," Hold on, wait for me, dammit."
"6069820","6073180"," Long on three ninety nine C for today."
"6265190","6267530"," Need to see this VIX break twenty forty. "
"6271950","6274330"," It's a critical to see VIX break twenty forty."
"6303360","6304800"," Twenty forty one is yourself."
"6305080","6306000"," I'll show it to you here in the background. "
"6307700","6314000"," I want to see VIX break through here twenty forty and begin to trade down."
"6314140","6316320"," If it begins to hold though, I'm going to cut those calls."
"6317380","6319900"," At some point we'll watch to see if we can get this VIX down here. "
"6319900","6321580"," Twenty forty four."
"6321660","6323380"," I want it to get below twenty forty one."
"6343960","6345660"," Got some walking that's going on here. "
"6410600","6412500"," Some weirdness going on with my."
"6413020","6413680"," There we go."
"6414340","6415460"," Close that there. "
"6548100","6549180"," Sweating bullets here."
"6550180","6552140"," I don't want to see this cross take place."
"6552700","6553740"," Sweating fucking bullets. "
"6553740","6554680"," I'm not going to lie to you."
"6573890","6576490"," Watching a one minute try to cross over the five here."
"6580480","6582300"," Come on, come on back. "
"6584120","6585140"," Oh fuck."
"6589200","6591660"," These fucking bulls can't pull together."
"6598190","6599890"," I'm watching VIX right now. "
"6599990","6600690"," It's just pinned."
"6618470","6620030"," Come on bulls."
"6650820","6653020"," These fucking bulls are going to get rolled here. "
"6690630","6700840"," I'm going to get a fucked up trigger, not a trigger, but my"
"6700840","6702600"," limit cells fucked up here."
"6704260","6713090"," I'm going to roll it right now."
"6722180","6723080"," Watching VIX right now. "
"6723740","6726280"," Need VIX to blast the fuck down through twenty."
"6727140","6730160"," If it's not going to, it looks like VIX is going to get a spike here."
"6732540","6733540"," Come on, VIX. "
"6759060","6760980"," I'm going to have to cut these and go put side."
"6778870","6780390"," Watching the cross right now."
"6782530","6784290"," I'm going to cut loose here in just a second. "
"6804700","6806000"," Sweating balls right now."
"6806720","6808520"," I'm watching this bears cross in the background."
"6809200","6812000"," Just be really careful if you are long here. "
"6812080","6813540"," I'm still long right now, but I'm panicking."
"6813760","6815520"," I'm about to sell out here in just a minute."
"6816860","6819780"," We're getting this bearish cross right now. "
"6819800","6821060"," Just be conscious of this."
"6821460","6824080"," It'll trade higher and rip lower to $4,396."
"6824700","6826400"," VIX is forming a base right now. "
"6826800","6827620"," Be really careful."
"6830060","6831840"," I'm about 39 cents."
"6832060","6834300"," I'm probably going to sell out here if I can catch 40 maybe. "
"6845500","6848040"," God damn two days in a row with this bullshit."
"6848760","6852160"," Two days like no follow through on bulls here."
"6852320","6853960"," I'm kind of pissed off right now. "
"6854300","6856780"," You're watching just one test of the five minute."
"6856800","6858360"," This is a bull's cross over right here."
"6858780","6861440"," One test fail like nothing. "
"6861720","6863000"," This is what I was talking about yesterday."
"6863700","6865920"," As you're seeing this shit happen in real time."
"6866160","6868280"," I'm still long calls right now, but I'm kind of pissed off. "
"6868920","6872940"," You're watching tests fail for bulls, right?"
"6873480","6874540"," Get a bull's cross right here."
"6874940","6875740"," Come right back through."
"6875840","6876560"," Throw it right under. "
"6876560","6879040"," Then you get the drop afterwards."
"6880040","6881740"," This kind of nonsense right here, man."
"6881900","6882880"," This shit pisses me off. "
"6883020","6884720"," Unusual to see this happen in the market."
"6885100","6887420"," Past two weeks, it's been like clockwork."
"6888280","6889660"," Absolute fucking clockwork. "
"6891380","6894240"," This is where I think that bots are taking money and running."
"6894820","6898640"," You come in here with size, you make some money, and then you cut your size loose."
"6899400","6900200"," Blast right below. "
"6901160","6902100"," Not normal."
"6902460","6903400"," Not usual to see this."
"6904340","6906700"," I'm still long calls here, but I'm fucking pissed. "
"6907280","6910760"," The moment that we come up here and reject off this one minute, it's going to get ugly."
"6911020","6914400"," So I'm a little pissed off here."
"6914680","6915780"," I'm not going to lie. "
"6916280","6918060"," This is the kind of shit that I'm talking about."
"6918080","6921040"," I don't want to be talking about positioning inside this market."
"6921620","6922740"," And no fucking way. "
"6922900","6925500"," My assumption here is that this is what's going on."
"6926280","6929940"," People are looking for simple setups and they're just getting taken on size."
"6930960","6932180"," I'm a little pissed off. "
"6932300","6932780"," I'm not going to lie."

"8604550","8606510"," Dude, they're not fucking paying me right now."
"8606610","8607730"," I'm at 40 cents right now. "
"8607830","8608270"," I'm pissed off."
"8608470","8610570"," It's only 25% for this squeeze right here."
"8617880","8618840"," 41 cents. "
"8623500","8625100"," I'm going to have taken some profit here."
"8638420","8659250"," I'd like"
"8659250","8664370"," to see something like this come up and then come back down and take this next trade white right in"
"8664370","8664550"," here."
"8665450","8667770"," Let's see if I can grab one more rip up higher here. "
"8678240","8679500"," That's a good winner for me."
"8701840","8703160"," It's not great though, man."
"8703300","8705840"," So this is a, so right here, this whole trade. "
"8707580","8714060"," Right here was, I think, I bought it at 32 cents and sold for 40 cents."
"8715640","8716920"," Still not great, man."
"8717100","8718320"," 25% for this. "
"8718680","8720340"," This should be like 50%."
"8721860","8723400"," It's a little pissed off right now."
"8723660","8725280"," I'm going to try to jump back in if I can. "
"8725600","8726720"," If this rolls a little bit."
"8727400","8729500"," Bring it one more roll in here at any point."
"8729580","8733640"," If it rolls back in and we can get one more touch to get this rip right here. "
"8735120","8736880"," So I'm going to try to try it."
"8736960","8740560"," If you're in this, this is called these calls right here, look for this PT above."
"8741240","8744900"," I want you to see it on spy just so you can see where it's going. "
"8745840","8748280"," I'm going to bring it over for you so you can see it here."
"8752040","8756560"," So as we come in right here, you'll see some resistance sellers came in previously."
"8757340","8761540"," Now we can break above this, but just be conscious that three times today is one. "
"8762200","8762920"," There's two."
"8764380","8769160"," You want to be able to jump back in above three ninety eight, ten or so."
"8769580","8772300"," As we come into it right now, three ninety eight, ten. "
"8779410","8781470"," Three ninety eight, tens right here."
"8785590","8787090"," Three ninety eight, oh five."
"8792230","8793510"," Three ninety eight, ten. "
"8794310","8798290"," The market's been slippery."
"8798650","8800770"," You have to be in and out to make money here."
"8805530","8808230"," Even now those calls are fifty forty two cents. "
"8809150","8810550"," It's kind of bullshit right here."
"8810650","8813750"," Twenty five percent trade for this big, huge move right here is kind of nonsense."
"8820430","8825150"," We'll snap a line and see if we tag it and consolidate and move higher. "
"8825590","8831530"," Or if we roll over and look for more buyers to step in here."
"8834250","8835550"," Three ninety eight, ten."
"8842400","8844220"," Now trade three ninety eight, oh seven. "
"8849110","8854770"," Above three ninety eight, ten, believe it or not, is four or two fifty."
"8856870","8860210"," Four or two fifty way up here."
"8860930","8863450"," Now these sellers though, I want to be warn you here. "
"8864270","8866150"," These sellers have been coming in right above."
"8866410","8868410"," There's one here, one seller here."
"8869030","8873030"," If they, if they come back in here, it could be a fast reversal down. "
"8873310","8877510"," So we're looking for enough support to get up there to that four or two."
"8885420","8887000"," Three ninety eight, ten."
"8888200","8890460"," See if we can squeeze through these sellers or not. "
"8893890","8895810"," I'll bring this over for you to look at."
"8897730","8899590"," So you can see them right here, okay."
"8901190","8904030"," Take your money here, jump back in above if we consolidate. "
"8904890","8908930"," We can get above here and consolidate and you start to see a new rip."
"8909110","8909750"," You can reenter."
"8910130","8912970"," But what you don't want to do is come up here, consolidate. "
"8913750","8915570"," And they throw it back down on you."
"8915630","8915810"," Okay."
"8916550","8917770"," I'll see you be careful of this. "
"8917910","8923490"," Another way to look at this too would be if we trade up here and come back down and we"
"8923490","8928190"," can take this rip off of the one and five minute to go higher as well."
"8963540","8965480"," Trade three ninety eight oh nine."
"8967300","8970220"," Trying to kind of break above right three ninety eight thirteen. "
"8972600","8974900"," Trying to break through this resistance right here."
"8976760","9003520"," This is"
"9003520","9005240"," the hourly trigger we're coming into right now."
"9005900","9007540"," One and five minutes trying to catch up. "
"9023540","9025240"," Let's look at this on a five minute chart."
"9028180","9029440"," Get more bullish here."
"9033400","9037120"," Let's see this resistance that's right here and you're watching the one and five minute. "
"9038580","9040560"," Trying to catch some of this move up here."
"9041340","9048400"," I want price to stay above right here for this move higher to four zero two believe it or not"
"9048400","9049340"," way way up there."
"9050300","9052660"," I want to catch this squeeze whenever it comes. "
"9057250","9058290"," Be a heavy printer."
"9061900","9066740"," So far these fucking sellers just keep coming in and just throwing it over throw it over the past"
"9066740","9067520"," two days right."
"9069400","9072460"," Came over just sold it down came over sold it down. "
"9105740","9108320"," Four hundreds are coming back still not back huge."
"9108580","9111760"," They're only at ninety two cents some down like twenty eight cents."
"9113220","9115460"," I'm saying Monday calls March 1st calls. "
"9116200","9120180"," If I say money to you today or tomorrow I'm just talking about the first of the month."
"9122340","9124240"," I don't know why I keep saying that."
"9130410","9131450"," It's huge up there. "
"9131630","9134130"," Let me show you this real quick so you can see what's happening here."
"9138010","9140150"," So I want to show you where that squeeze is."
"9140290","9144610"," It's just building me a mute this book map here. "
"9147590","9149010"," Can we just look at this monster."
"9149490","9150950"," This thing is just a monster."
"9152390","9153190"," Look at it. "
"9156310","9163570"," You know down here facing out down here consolidating over here just just begging for a face"
"9163570","9163970"," ripper."
"9165070","9169010"," Just begging to scream higher to four or two like just begging for it."
"9171190","9172850"," Pissing me off to no end. "
"9172870","9175850"," I'm like I'm on baby running up there."
"9180960","9182700"," I'm loaded to the tits on."
"9183100","9183980"," I shouldn't be saying that. "
"9183980","9189320"," I'm loaded to the tits on calls for the first for this squeeze higher whenever it happens."
"9189320","9195740"," I'm in and out of zero dates to catch that trip because this would be a pretty big."
"9196160","9198680"," This is not priced in as they say. "
"9200280","9202980"," A trip up here is definitely not priced in."
"9202980","9216940"," I need"
"9221260","9222620"," VIX to roll over to."
"9241610","9244950"," 399 C is now trading forty nine cents fifty cents. "
"9263020","9264400"," Watching VIX in the background."
"9264640","9265680"," It's starting to roll over."
"9265800","9268520"," It needs to break twenty dollars and forty one cents. "
"9269960","9273160"," I just want to show you the VIX real quick what it needs to do."
"9273160","9279880"," Oh yeah baby look at that squeeze."
"9282680","9289420"," Squeezed oh shit so VIX just broke twenty one VIX just finally broke underneath twenty thirty nine. "
"9290460","9293220"," We might have a nice fat run in our hands right here folks."
"9293440","9294900"," This might be the squeeze we're looking for."
"9298300","9303480"," Trading up to the pivot right now thirty nine fifty nine gap above a three ninety nine. "
"9303800","9305520"," See if we can keep squeezing here."
"9315760","9318820"," 400 C's on Monday looking much better right now."
"9318840","9319800"," I'm getting happy again. "
"9320760","9323940"," I'm getting very happy here we go much happier."
"9326720","9328680"," So now I want to show you VIX here."
"9328980","9329740"," We could be on a run. "
"9329880","9332520"," We'll wait and see if this we want to see here is."
"9333060","9335880"," I'm going to show you the VIX we want to see the VIX do."
"9336920","9341120"," So we want to see VIX reject twenty forty. "
"9341780","9344280"," We want to see VIX actually trade down to."
"9349450","9352190"," Somewhere down in here like nineteen twenty."
"9352750","9355230"," It has to hold though if it doesn't hold. "
"9356410","9363650"," We need VIX to reject and trade lower down here it's like nineteen ten or so."
"9363650","9368410"," And if we can get that we should get a run now if we can't pull I'm not showing you"
"9368410","9368570"," this."
"9369490","9377410"," We need VIX to to get pinned underneath like ground the VIX below twenty dollars and forty one"
"9377410","9377710"," cents. "
"9378010","9382170"," We need price to stay below here for a move higher."
"9384050","9388490"," So keep your eyes on the VIX and see if we can get a move higher."
"9389690","9392310"," We're going to need the one in five minutes to catch up to the VIX. "
"9394410","9396650"," So we can trade this four or two."
"9418720","9420540"," So PT one was tagged here."
"9421000","9423180"," We want to see this hold here. "
"9423280","9424780"," We want this yellow bar here to hold."
"9425540","9428220"," We want the one minute and the five minute to catch back up."
"9428320","9429520"," We're going to look at the five minute real quick. "
"9430360","9433100"," We're bullish here just so you know whether you know this or not."
"9433300","9433740"," We are bullish."
"9433960","9435140"," We need to hold price though. "
"9435540","9438920"," Price has to stay above this five minute."
"9438920","9443540"," Price has to stay above currently three ninety nine or three ninety seven ninety three."
"9444400","9446500"," Yeah three ninety seven ninety three basically. "
"9451630","9455750"," Three ninety seven ninety three."
"9457250","9458090"," Right there."
"9468590","9473550"," Lift up your dress JP Morgan and show me show me your underwear at four or two. "
"9476690","9478450"," Jamie show me your dress man."
"9478450","9480150"," Pull your dress up and let me see your legs."
"9515110","9518010"," Dude four or two C's are only two cents man. "
"9518350","9520070"," Four or two's are three cents right now."
"9521990","9523510"," The three fucking pennies."
"9524450","9526230"," Four or ones are eight cents for today. "
"9527230","9528470"," Four hundred and twenty two cents."
"9535050","9537410"," I just want to load the fuck out of like three hundred."
"9537410","9541590"," I want to do like three hundred lots of four hundred C right now. "
"9541930","9542610"," Really bad."
"9555000","9555940"," Let's hear it down there."
"9556480","9557180"," You got it. "
"9557280","9557780"," Even read the chat."
"9558340","9559340"," I'm not even reading the chat."
"9559420","9560220"," I'm reading the chat guys. "
"9560720","9561940"," I see what you guys are saying."
"9563900","9564640"," I want to see."
"9564980","9566260"," I'm looking at the I'm looking. "
"9566540","9567940"," So I'm sitting here and looking at the fucking."
"9568380","9570260"," I'm in here looking at the fucking options chain."
"9570400","9570660"," I'm like. "
"9571080","9572960"," So four or two's are three cents."
"9573640","9574860"," Four or ones are eight cents."
"9574860","9576940"," Four hundreds are twenty one cents. "
"9578220","9580240"," So dealers are saying we're not going up there."
"9580560","9581320"," I'm like what do you mean."
"9581860","9583940"," Now March 1st is saying we're going up there. "
"9584480","9585440"," March 1st is like."
"9586000","9588540"," If you think we're going to four or two you're going to pay a dollar for it."
"9589820","9593160"," But March 2nd they're like now we're not or February 28th. "
"9593260","9594140"," We're not going up there man."
"9594740","9596180"," I don't know if I believe these fucking."
"9596400","9597700"," I don't know if I believe these fucking dealers. "
"9598180","9601360"," I don't believe these fucking guys."
"9601800","9603080"," I think they're fucking lying to me."
"9612760","9613960"," It's hairy down there. "
"9617170","9618830"," I know this squeeze is coming."
"9619230","9620630"," I don't want to fucking miss it."
"9624900","9627300"," Now I'm just sitting here fucking patiently waiting. "
"9646550","9653130"," I mean man they're not priced in four hundred."
"9653230","9654110"," They're not priced in."
"9657010","9658470"," They're not priced in four hundreds. "
"9658730","9660270"," They're not priced in four or twos."
"9660330","9661590"," They're not priced in four or ones."
"9663730","9665550"," They're not priced any of that shit in right now. "
"9674340","9675060"," This is bullshit."
"9675480","9677640"," Fuck this whole thing right here is big dragon right here."
"9677680","9678340"," People call this dragon. "
"9678980","9680480"," It should face rip here."
"9681780","9684980"," Like straight face rip to just rip fucking face right here."
"9710310","9712090"," So I made enough on that last trade. "
"9712310","9714450"," So you tell me how crazy this is."
"9714650","9715670"," I bring them like this."
"9715830","9716310"," I'm like okay. "
"9716890","9718350"," This made some serious money."
"9718610","9722410"," It wasn't a ton of money percentage wise, but it was it was a position of size."
"9723430","9728430"," So I'm like do I I'm like do I just start buying fucking shit tickets today and tomorrow. "
"9729790","9734350"," They just start buying a bunch of fucking calls with the with the gains and just burn them."
"9734350","9735790"," I don't care because if they go up."
"9736390","9740370"," I'm looking at 400 season like those fuckers will print like three, four, five hundred percent. "
"9741370","9744170"," I'm like if I buy some more of those tomorrow at the bell today."
"9747410","9750070"," Like these fucking things will just be I don't care if they even burn."
"9761080","9762380"," That's what I'm thinking right now. "
"9762760","9764960"," I'm going to take all this money and just start buying fucking calls."
"9765760","9766720"," Twenty cent calls."
"9768180","9770540"," Fucking print like two bucks and like five fifteen minutes. "
"9774950","9776070"," Being patient though."
"9776250","9777310"," Just sitting on the hands."
"9778430","9782710"," Still have 400s for tomorrow, but I'm like if I can grab some calls here in just a minute. "
"9783610","9785170"," Hopefully I don't get left behind."
"9790710","9791930"," I'm watching Vicks here."
"9792090","9792970"," We need Vicks. "
"9793090","9794170"," You don't really have a choice here."
"9795210","9797130"," But to have Vicks roll over."
"9797470","9799150"," It's rolled over, but it's still not under. "
"9799450","9800490"," Oh, it's under, but it's not."
"9801690","9805830"," So here this is what I'm watching in the background here."
"9807230","9808870"," So what I want to see happen. "
"9810270","9812550"," Is I want to see this red line."
"9813190","9814290"," This red line right here."
"9814990","9816470"," I want to see this red line come down. "
"9817590","9819930"," And I want to see this white line come down right here."
"9822370","9823890"," And I want to see price follow."
"9827390","9829290"," If price can follow this down. "
"9831070","9832530"," That's where our rip is right there."
"9833950","9835530"," Until this gets down here though."
"9835650","9837290"," It's just bullshit right now in my view. "
"9838230","9839270"," I need to see."
"9839650","9843210"," I need to see this stuff come down here and start to get some velocity to the downside on the"
"9843210","9843490"," Vicks."
"9847800","9849700"," We've already broken support here. "
"9849980","9851520"," We're underneath it right now currently."
"9852460","9854400"," What I don't want to see is Vicks squeeze."
"9855020","9856000"," So if Vicks ends up squeezing. "
"9857800","9859020"," And comes up here."
"9859300","9862740"," You'll see the roll over in the spy again, right?"
"9863600","9867540"," And I definitely don't want to see it squeeze to the five minutes start squeezing high here."
"9867640","9868940"," That would be the bloodbath in the market. "
"9869140","9872060"," That's what you said yesterday when I was like, Hey, be careful here."
"9872640","9874200"," We could roll the market over."
"9876020","9876860"," It's right here. "
"9876960","9878320"," What happens is you'll see price."
"9878620","9880900"," If Vicks squeezes, you'd see price squeeze up here."
"9882240","9883580"," Quickly roll over here. "
"9883820","9885420"," You'd be trapped inside some calls."
"9886720","9887940"," And then they'd try to send it over."
"9888220","9890020"," And that's your five minute right there in the Vicks. "
"9890480","9891560"," Five minute right there."
"9903270","9903970"," I'm surprised."
"9903970","9905150"," I was looking at meta, man. "
"9905290","9905890"," Past couple of days."
"9905890","9906690"," Metas looking bullish."
"9907110","9907710"," I'll be honest with you. "
"9908930","9911370"," Meta is surprising me right now."
"9911910","9916430"," So past since Thursday, I'm going to give bulls something here."
"9917390","9925410"," Since Thursday, I've been watching the market breath and tech stocks after hours looking at them"
"9925410","9928210"," and they're buying. "
"9929630","9930870"," Banks are buying that shit."
"9931070","9935030"," So breath was at a serious low yesterday morning."
"9936350","9939410"," And by afternoon, you saw the market being bought. "
"9939830","9942770"," So we're in the end of month and they are buying the market."
"9945510","9946210"," I'm surprised."
"9946550","9947170"," I'll be honest with you. "
"9948790","9950250"," It's good to see if you're a bull."
"9952230","9955350"," Or if your bull is for bullish for March, you want to see that."
"9955490","9956370"," And that's what we're seeing right now. "
"9991810","9996010"," How about this, how about call out some tickers and I'll look at some tickers that you guys want to"
"9996010","9996210"," see."
"10004610","10008930"," If you have some tickers out there that you want to see, uh, let me know inside the chat."
"10019460","10020480"," P and W."
"10047610","10050550"," I'd like to see P and W trade. "
"10053530","10054230"," Let's squeeze."
"10054230","10055210"," It's been squeezy."
"10056570","10059270"," Coming into it's hourly right now, interacting with the hourly. "
"10059450","10061110"," Could squeeze here right where we are right now."
"10062290","10064930"," As long as price stays above one 89 30."
"10068870","10071030"," I'll bring up P and W for a hold up. "
"10074550","10075570"," Thanks for your today."
"10075770","10076350"," Yeah, I can look at those."
"10076550","10077010"," Hold on a second here. "
"10082030","10086250"," I got to keep an instance of spy open in another when I bring this over because I want to"
"10086250","10088070"," buy some of the spy here again."
"10090730","10092170"," I'll do your ticker as well."
"10092470","10095070"," I have to open up a spy. "
"10097730","10100150"," Another instance of spy because I want to grab."
"10100470","10101250"," I want to go long here."
"10108650","10111110"," I'm looking for a dip by on spy. "
"10112810","10114490"," Uh, three ninety eight fifteen."
"10114530","10115150"," If we can get it."
"10116810","10119010"," I make it left behind here, but. "
"10119970","10122030"," Three ninety seven eighty four two."
"10122310","10124550"," I'm looking at that price down there to grab that."
"10125390","10129590"," So Palo Alto networks been trading very well, trading on. "
"10129690","10129970"," It's hourly."
"10131770","10132550"," It's done."
"10132750","10136610"," It's had very good interactions with its hourly trigger down here. "
"10136710","10137210"," Do you see this?"
"10137770","10145790"," It's got a nice support underneath it at 168 or 169.01 and 163."
"10146290","10147290"," It's very healthy right now."
"10148150","10150450"," Palo Alto networks as a buyer. "
"10151510","10153070"," I would really like to buy."
"10155310","10157350"," One eighty seven fifty."
"10159330","10161090"," Although it might not get down this low. "
"10162190","10164830"," This is also a place for you to have stops."
"10167150","10170450"," You can see down below that when it breaks below."
"10171130","10173310"," As long as it doesn't hold, it does quite well. "
"10173590","10177490"," So if you're to have stops here, it might actually be quite lower, right?"
"10177630","10184120"," It could be more like one eighty five ish, maybe one eighty four."
"10186240","10187160"," Somewhere in there."
"10187660","10188460"," It could actually be lower. "
"10189360","10190700"," Maybe a buy even lower here."
"10196140","10198320"," It's setting alert on one eighty, I think."
"10206470","10208690"," If you're already long Palo Alto, that's nice. "
"10209990","10211130"," I would stay long Palo Alto."
"10211370","10214550"," You could probably take profit if it breaks below one eighty seven."
"10217170","10218630"," Right now it's trading nicely. "
"10225960","10233930"," It could be looking to be a buyer one eighty though."
"10234470","10238850"," It could also be interested in it at one seventy."
"10242700","10244420"," Maybe set an alert and you're. "
"10248620","10250620"," Set an alert for one seventy and one eighty."
"10257140","10258680"," Just pure bullish right now."
"10268830","10271530"," One eighty eight or so is where you pull the plug on it. "
"10272230","10274770"," Looked to buy below a one seventy one eighty somewhere in there."
"10277890","10279030"," I like Palo Alto."
"10281030","10282810"," I missed a dip buy in here. "
"10282930","10285190"," I wanted to buy this on spy."
"10299790","10303750"," You got three hundred and fifty five thousand calls on three ninety eight C."
"10306970","10307950"," Expiring today."
"10312420","10316880"," Question becomes do they actually close this or they close those in the money today or not. "
"10320120","10324560"," People are going to own the spy today."
"10336120","10338060"," Beyond meats you want to do."
"10338540","10355710"," Beyond meats has"
"10358620","10361440"," really nice interaction with its daily. "
"10365240","10367600"," Nice trading off its daily down here."
"10367600","10370360"," Beyond meats set an alert for."
"10376250","10377530"," Seventeen dollars flat. "
"10379270","10381570"," It might take some consolidation here."
"10382070","10385590"," Be careful down below seventeen dollars though because you do have."
"10387010","10389690"," You do have some major sellers above here. "
"10393860","10398240"," You don't want to get trapped underneath sixteen bucks and fifty cents somewhere in there."
"10401670","10402890"," It's a little bit higher right here."
"10403450","10404130"," Sixteen fifty. "
"10406110","10407550"," But it's come back very well."
"10407630","10408750"," It's done very well over here."
"10408950","10411290"," Traded very nicely off its daily trigger here. "
"10411490","10412430"," It's done very well."
"10416230","10417950"," Very well off its daily trigger."
"10419570","10423050"," Currently it sits at a seventeen oh one. "
"10424110","10426250"," Doing it some interaction here tends to squeeze."
"10427530","10428250"," That's beyond."
"10431770","10432550"," Next one. "
"10433770","10434790"," What else do you have there?"
"10435610","10436370"," Natural gas."
"10437110","10438090"," What do you want like."
"10440990","10443350"," We go to that we go to Wendy's and look up boil. "
"10452260","10454020"," Nanny gas ready to squeeze man."
"10457000","10458900"," Nanny gas looking explosive right now."
"10461480","10462860"," Now you mean just one second. "
"10464400","10466380"," I'll be right back hold on one second here."
"10592280","10594280"," Sorry I'm trying to get my stuff turned back on here."
"10601720","10604300"," Natural gas is a three trigger cluster right now. "
"10605300","10611840"," Let me look at UNG."
"10628400","10628880"," 863."
"10638620","10642840"," That's trading under it's cluster right now but it's not a three trigger you can't see it on the"
"10642840","10643080"," screen. "
"10644180","10647760"," But if it can maintain at any point price above 865."
"10649600","10651180"," It should blast higher."
"10653860","10658240"," So just set an alert on 865 ish for today if you want to see it come up. "
"10661860","10664400"," Matter of fact just got a green bar right now here."
"10666660","10669300"," It could start blasting off here it's about."
"10670200","10674860"," So I'll show it to you on a trigger cluster. "
"10676840","10682200"," And it does very nicely on it's daily now with that being said."
"10682860","10688900"," You can see the cell pressure above here and see how it's sold off above here at nine bucks."
"10689640","10693420"," And that cell pressure is still there okay so just be careful of. "
"10696220","10701220"," The selling pressure above there's there's a there's a squeeze play here too above it."
"10701540","10705620"," The above 929 would be super bullish on on natural gas."
"10713440","10715720"," The hourly doesn't look good right now. "
"10716640","10717920"," I don't like seeing this here."
"10720180","10724580"," I really prefer to see us bottoming on negative velocity down below."
"10725020","10728980"," I always like to see stuff like this where we're kind of at a bottom. "
"10729920","10736260"," Right it's we're starting to come up here so you can see where velocity the negative velocity is on"
"10736260","10737580"," it's way up right."
"10738120","10742000"," And then you come into some positive velocity up here and you can see exactly where you take your"
"10742000","10742560"," money and run."
"10743840","10745920"," So do I like it here probably not. "
"10747700","10753020"," At least something hourly I'd really like to see it come back down and consolidate."
"10755180","10758360"," So can natural gas go up here sure can you get a squeeze here."
"10759260","10763820"," It's not really it's not really what you want to see though right you want to see. "
"10766160","10771660"," See natural gas come down here and catch one more dip right probably at eight bucks."
"10773220","10778060"," It's not the it's not that you can't go up here it's that you want to get some velocity behind"
"10778060","10778980"," your moves right."
"10779460","10783400"," How long are you going to be in that trade for it's like eight bucks to be looking to buy"
"10783400","10783740"," in here. "
"10785840","10788180"," Can't squeeze up here in tag nine sure."
"10789480","10794440"," I'm probably not a buyer though unless it's at eight dollars or are you like interested."
"10795940","10798300"," That's like eight dollars here I'd be interested in that. "
"10798920","10802460"," I'd also be interested if it was able to hold above nine."
"10803120","10807180"," But let's say it does hold above nine you're still going to be waiting for price to."
"10809460","10814840"," Or not price but for the one the five and the hourly to catch back up so it'd be like. "
"10815940","10818740"," You're breaking above nine bucks and you need time here."
"10819940","10823700"," And even then you couldn't take the trade unless it broke above."
"10824960","10827340"," Kind of a kind of a weird place for natural gas right here. "
"10828280","10829820"," Not really a fan of it at the moment."
"10831100","10832880"," Personally I'm not saying it can't go up here."
"10833820","10838000"," But the great trade in this trade would be come back down and find some support. "
"10839600","10844480"," Let this daily trigger come down and give some time to get above."
"10844720","10845260"," But we aren't a cluster."
"10846240","10848700"," So if you're bullish natural gas here I understand why. "
"10851960","10858660"," I understand that you want to take this and rip face up here to nine nine twenty seven I guess"
"10858660","10859140"," right there."
"10862040","10866200"," And that's probably nine flat take some of your money over here."
"10873620","10874940"," I'm not anti this trade. "
"10875860","10879940"," I shouldn't say I'm anti that trade but you're getting your stops are down here right."
"10880300","10884520"," They already tried to blast you down over here early to shake out buyers."
"10893600","10897880"," I always like to not gas trade when it's you know this is the thing about this trade right. "
"10898100","10899300"," You can tell you can't take this trade."
"10899780","10905960"," But let's just look at where it's a great trade and it's a great trade when we're in the bottom"
"10905960","10906700"," end of velocity."
"10907100","10908440"," So it's not that you can't go up here. "
"10908560","10910380"," It's that I'm not a fan of it."
"10910540","10914540"," I thought I was a fan of it here but I guess five minutes ago until the velocity."
"10918280","10920440"," You kind of want to see this right here right. "
"10920580","10921640"," So this is the spy right."
"10922320","10923720"," This is what I'm talking about here."
"10923900","10924480"," So see spy. "
"10926420","10928680"," So spy is not showing us this right."
"10928680","10931900"," Spy is not showing us price wise that we're gotten anywhere yet."
"10932500","10933700"," You see how negative velocity. "
"10935500","10938400"," You know it's starting to turn bullish here right."
"10938740","10942400"," So velocity is starting to go up on spy right now but price hasn't shown itself."
"10942980","10944960"," You haven't seen price actually slam higher. "
"10946020","10949320"," So velocity is building to the upside on spy."
"10950020","10951580"," Even though it hasn't shown itself yet."
"10952480","10955480"," So I'm just kind of sitting here watching spy right now. "
"10955480","10956180"," I'm going."
"10956520","10958260"," Why isn't price showing it?"
"10958480","10960460"," It's building here to do it."
"10961860","10965400"," I should have bought this down here and it wasn't paying attention. "
"10981020","10984120"," I'm long again right now the market on zero dates."
"10986140","10987460"," I'm not even going to wait here."
"11002400","11004120"," I'll just throw them away. "
"11004120","11009700"," If I have to, I'll just throw them away because velocity is just building to rip face here."
"11035180","11036700"," Yeah, the one hour is due."
"11036820","11037680"," The one hour is getting. "
"11039420","11043220"," Price isn't showing on spy man but you just saw the chart there."
"11043420","11045300"," We're getting super fucking bullish here."
"11045800","11049640"," All this consolidation leads into a face ripper. "
"11049940","11051060"," So normally it does."
"11052040","11055440"," Not always but options."
"11055640","11056760"," The market's not pricing it in. "
"11057780","11058760"," I've been frustrated."
"11058960","11063440"," Past few days have been pretty fucking frustrated trying to catch one of these face rips."
"11063580","11064920"," And we know it's going to happen eventually. "
"11070010","11070970"," Oh, there we go."
"11077860","11079480"," There ain't nobody stopping it either."
"11081100","11082940"," This training getting stopped for nobody. "
"11084580","11085960"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"11085960","11087140"," Whoo hoo."
"11089380","11090280"," Whoo hoo. "
"11090340","11091740"," Squeeze in the spy now."
"11093000","11094020"," Squeeze it for daddy."
"11094240","11094900"," Get the gap bill. "
"11095240","11097040"," Close that fucking gap up there."
"11098780","11099560"," Oh, dude."
"11100040","11101580"," Yeah, give me that money. "
"11105630","11107130"," Give me that fucking money."
"11108310","11112010"," Dude, 400's were like fucking 20 cents a few little while ago."
"11112430","11113890"," Now trading 29 cents. "
"11116170","11118790"," $3.99 trading 65 cents."
"11122030","11126370"," Oh, I got to switch over to fucking March 1st."
"11127250","11129310"," Yeah, something's about tasty fucking sucks. "
"11130870","11132990"," I'm still not up on my 400's."
"11133110","11136530"," I'm fucking down like I'm thinking down six cents in my fucking."
"11137570","11139370"," Down like six cents on those. "
"11139570","11139810"," That sucks."
"11140090","11140650"," That's bullshit."
"11144130","11147210"," Now trading 30 cents on fucking 400 C's. "
"11152980","11154520"," Show me your fucking skirt."

"11157180","11158300"," Show it to me, dude. "
"11158540","11158800"," Show me."
"11158920","11160200"," Show me your hearing legs, bro."
"11161040","11162640"," Now trading up to the gap. "
"11162800","11170200"," Fill the gap above at 3.99. 3.98. Hell yeah, gap."
"11170880","11171120"," Fill it."
"11172180","11173540"," Close the gap. "
"11174260","11176200"," Now I remember yesterday we closed the gap."
"11176380","11177220"," We came right back down."
"11177930","11181880"," But the gap below nominated Julie Sue is the next labor secretary. "
"11185950","11188470"," Oh yeah, return to the scene of the crime too."
"11189250","11190490"," Close the H line above."
"11192750","11193710"," Hell yeah. "

"11206810","11208770"," 3.98. 96 baby. "
"11209790","11211370"," Very nice pin strike."
"11214220","11217140"," Get a little bit of a gap still there as a tiny, tiny bit."
"11217300","11218280"," Then close all of it. "
"11220560","11222040"," We are above the pivot."
"11222240","11225480"," We're now into positive gamma on intraday charts."
"11230840","11232020"," Captain's happy now. "
"11232900","11234200"," Fucking super happy."
"11238760","11239680"," Super stoked."
"11257580","11258920"," A little bit of a gap still above. "
"11259080","11259640"," Tiny bit."
"11261300","11262820"," Small bit of gap up there."
"11263680","11264580"," Fuck yeah dude. "
"11267760","11268240"," Stoked."
"11268740","11270100"," That's two fucking green trades."

"11284490","11285370"," Gap is now closed."
"11287370","11287850"," Above."
"11288370","11289230"," Now we've just got the. "

"11543870","11545330"," Stop somewhere below this nine bucks. "
"11545590","11549650"," But just sitting in this trade for a squeeze higher is pretty big."

"13150320","13153120"," And I have a choice do I have to be on exactly at a certain time every day. "
"13156710","13158410"," So you'll get that from me at some point."

"13545910","13546510"," Start to head higher."
"13546670","13547430"," We're seeing that."
"13550370","13551970"," So far we've seen both of those things. "
"13552190","13553250"," We haven't seen price go up though."
"13556490","13559170"," And then we want February 28 to close."
"13560250","13561310"," It was 408. "
"13561570","13562050"," Now it's 402."
"13563310","13565630"," So we're just waiting to see what today closes that."

"13570150","13571410"," We got one more day left in this market. "
"13571750","13576130"," And we know right now south side's like, oh hell no, we don't want to close 402."
"13583030","13586610"," They don't want to see a weekly to monthly close above 402."
"13588110","13588630"," At all. "
"13588950","13589510"," They don't want to see it."
"13589710","13591690"," So we'll see where we close today."
"13604790","13606490"," So far this looks like December. "
"13607670","13608750"," If you were trading December."
"13609910","13612950"," The first when we first came down to that level in December."
"13613970","13615750"," We had a very we had a crash. "
"13615950","13617710"," We actually had a market crash warning."
"13618870","13620530"," That first day we did."
"13620850","13622310"," I think it was a Friday or something. "
"13622490","13624590"," As a matter of fact, J.D. bridge back."
"13625110","13628390"," On Twitter and I both commented on Twitter."
"13628990","13631950"," We're both like, oh that Friday closes fucking dangerous. "
"13632670","13634800"," Like it was really sketchy."
"13635820","13639500"," All the indicators were saying it was like flashing crash warning."
"13641200","13644320"," But then after the next over next 12, 13 sessions. "
"13645480","13646320"," We didn't crash."
"13646660","13648740"," We actually started to accumulate the market."
"13650020","13653460"," And people are still calling for a crash 13 sessions in. "
"13654200","13655600"," And I was like, nah, nah, nah, nah."
"13655640","13657080"," I don't think the service they're buying this shit."
"13657200","13657800"," They're not selling it. "
"13657800","13659140"," Sometimes you'll see."
"13660100","13664940"," Matter of fact, in January of 2022, you could see before the crash after the crash began."
"13665600","13667940"," You could see no accumulation in the market. "
"13668100","13671540"," They were actually selling the market and price was still high."
"13673040","13674360"," And you can actually go back and just look."
"13674520","13675580"," It was pretty simple to see. "
"13677780","13680500"," And right now we're not seeing that right now at this moment."
"13680760","13680900"," So."
"13682400","13683300"," Let's go higher. "
"13685760","13688620"," Let's close this shit about four or two on the end of month."
"13696930","13698530"," Yeah, I think he has like eight jobs."
"13698750","13699830"," Let's like add one more to it. "
"13710180","13711780"," So let me ask you this question."
"13712440","13716400"," They were calling for, they were calling for March 21 to be 3000."
"13718060","13719760"," Then they were calling for Q1 to be 3600. "
"13720740","13722540"," What if the low is in for Q1?"
"13725540","13726900"," What did you think about that?"
"13727060","13727700"," If that was true."
"13729320","13730700"," Maybe absurd, wouldn't it?"
"13732500","13739160"," Last weekend I was looking at this past weekend, I was looking at the two year yield."
"13740620","13741700"," The yield inversion. "
"13743740","13745300"," And I was like, okay, so."
"13746660","13749800"," I was like, what happens with the yield curve version historically?"
"13750100","13752880"," And I'm like, oh, sometimes the market just melts straight the fuck up for a year."
"13754020","13755160"," When it rolls over. "
"13755860","13757440"," They don't tell you that though, do they?"
"13758780","13760420"," There's a reason that happens to."
"13765250","13769230"," If we're not at the bottom of unemployment starting to curl up, if we haven't cut rates of"
"13769230","13771130"," inflation, is that a bottom, which it's not yet?"
"13773150","13778710"," We need those kind of things to happen for the yield curve in version two matter, even if it rolls"
"13778710","13779070"," over."
"13811380","13813100"," Yeah, I'm still long calls here. "
"13814080","13816120"," I'm like, show me your fucking skirt, Jamie."
"13817000","13818800"," Marco, pull your fucking dress up."
"13824410","13829450"," Fucking Goldman Sachs, pull all your skirts up, pull your pants down, show them what's around those"
"13829450","13829670"," ankles. "
"13840350","13841590"," Tony cheese, baby."
"13857110","13860470"," Yeah, Tesla's about to explode here, about to rip fucking faces off."
"13860630","13861390"," They're trying to pin spy. "
"13862830","13866510"," But the underlying tickers are all ready to move here."
"13868970","13874210"," This is mostly market shorts on the market right now, trying to stop price from closing on a high."
"13875050","13877430"," But the rest of the market's just cranking right now. "
"13878770","13881430"," Tesla, Apple, everybody's cranking right now."
"13882210","13883350"," They're trying to fucking pin the spy."
"13883350","13889400"," I guess I don't know if we hit this yet. "
"13889640","13896300"," We're not quite, still haven't quite tagged out the, um, the south side here, the H line."
"13897640","13898940"," It was like a penny short."
"13899740","13901980"," When we break above this, though, we'll start squeezing. "
"13904140","13905860"," We only break above this H line."
"13906180","13907740"," It's on, it's on like Donkey Kong."
"13908420","13910120"," This is where the sellers are right here. "
"13911240","13912260"," Sellers are right here."
"13912360","13913620"," Just need to break above these sellers."
"13914120","13915300"," There's not many of them left. "
"13918160","13919920"," And pull them fucking shorts off."
"13920980","13923380"," Start taking longs, be a zombie bull with us."
"13924820","13926280"," Turn you into a fucking zombie. "
"13930140","13934560"," We have to take the, take the long side, sell side having to take the long side."
"13935520","13936820"," Always like to see it."
"13950270","13951630"," Ask, slap that ass. "
"13952030","13954870"," So, uh, exclamation point asked, does slap that ass?"
"13956470","13957390"," Hell yes."
"13963280","13965580"," Zombie longs are always the best longs."
"13966860","13968740"," That's volume on your side, man. "
"13968940","13971420"," That's when hedge funds, sell side hedge funds are on your side."
"13974620","13976700"," See if I can get this thing going here."
"13977060","13977720"," Hold on here. "
"13978080","13980360"," Let me get this thing going here."
"13981420","13985320"," Can I get, can I get those chest, chest out here?"
"13986100","13987440"," Gotta get that pump on."
"13988260","13990600"," Gotta get that flex going right there. "
"13990900","13991920"," Gotta get that squeeze."
"13993620","13994060"," Squeeze."
"13994580","13995500"," Gotta squeeze them. "
"13997300","13999160"," That's why I need some squeezing going on."
"13999820","14001320"," Some back of my chest back here."
"14001420","14001780"," Oh, yeah. "
"14001980","14002280"," Feel those."
"14002460","14003620"," I feel that right in the breast."
"14005060","14006640"," Gotta squeeze them out. "
"14007780","14009940"," I don't know when it's going to be, but I know it's going to happen."
"14009940","14011720"," It's either today, it's Monday or tomorrow."
"14012320","14013120"," Keep saying Monday. "
"14013840","14014600"," Maybe it's tomorrow."
"14015000","14018400"," I don't know exactly what it is, but I know we're going to squeeze these sellers out."
"14019740","14021300"," Some point here, it's going to happen. "
"14021420","14021820"," I know it."
"14022760","14023700"," I know it's going to happen."
"14023820","14025800"," I don't want to hear anything that's trying to tell me here. "
"14026480","14027800"," Anything that's trying to tell me."
"14028840","14029460"," Oh, yeah."
"14029700","14031820"," I feel that right in the upper chest. "
"14035480","14036680"," Feel that right here."
"14036900","14037520"," Feel it right there."
"14039260","14041940"," Get those little tiny, tiny, tiny muscles going in there. "
"14046600","14051740"," It's someone who's just said that someone in the stream is like, just some guys like, I want to buy"
"14051740","14053500"," the fuck out of this five minute right here."
"14053500","14054240"," Please come on down."
"14056400","14057640"," He's like, you left me behind. "
"14057640","14058380"," Don't leave me behind."
"14059700","14060560"," Just some guy."
"14062400","14063820"," We Jim Broad again. "
"14066980","14067760"," Oh, man."
"14069200","14079020"," Oh, yeah."
"14092210","14097130"," I kind of stretch my back out there real quick. "
"14119880","14121840"," There it is right there, boys and girls."
"14123480","14124580"," There it is."
"14130860","14131680"," Start stream. "
"14131840","14132840"," I got an exercise bike."
"14139200","14142420"," I wasn't paying the Peloton prices, though."
"14142840","14145980"," I was like, fuck no, I'm not paying those Peloton prices. "
"14150240","14152980"," I'm like, I'm going to get an iPad seriously."
"14154160","14155800"," I'm like, I'm going to get a nice bike and an iPad."
"14156500","14160540"," I'm going to put that Peloton inside pad up and then right there. "
"14160760","14161320"," Hold on a second here."
"14167840","14169660"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"14171120","14171820"," Feelin' it. "
"14175180","14175880"," Feelin' it."
"14178780","14182520"," Spending some time down here, consolidating on the one minute."
"14190560","14193700"," Vicks just, dude, look at Vicks just selling out. "
"14194620","14196500"," Vicks looking like a dumpster fire."
"14205920","14209340"," I don't know if you're watching the Vicks right now, but look at this shit."
"14209520","14210880"," I got to show you some crazy shit. "
"14212440","14214660"," I mean, this is a fucking disaster."
"14216320","14218300"," Let's not look at the Vicks right now, right?"
"14219760","14222120"," Vicks was at a high in the 22nd."
"14224540","14226260"," The 22nd of February, right?"
"14227040","14228080"," The Vicks was at a high. "
"14228600","14231460"," It is sold down to its hourly trigger."
"14233260","14238120"," Now it's underneath its hourly and the spy is not showing that in price right now."
"14238540","14244940"," I mean, the sell side is just ramming on the spy right now. "
"14247080","14248120"," You see the Vicks?"
"14248280","14249300"," You guys look at the Vicks."
"14250620","14251680"," I don't fucking bullshit."
"14256960","14258640"," I don't bullshit, man. "
"14260000","14263000"," I hope it's like straight to the moon."
"14264100","14267780"," Like 60, 70, 80 points, just straight bars up."
"14276940","14278780"," Straight bars up. "
"14279460","14280180"," Look at the Vicks."
"14282960","14287360"," Right there on 440 in the afternoon on the 22nd."
"14288440","14290040"," Six days ago. "
"14291180","14299740"," Had a high, right, of $25.53. Now trading at $20.21. And yet price hasn't shown on the spy."
"14300040","14300820"," Come on, get out of here."
"14302060","14304660"," The spy should be 402 like right now. "
"14306900","14308260"," Today, end of day."
"14324250","14324970"," Watch that."
"14325050","14327310"," We had some sellers come in just at this moment right here. "
"14327410","14328170"," Just be careful here."
"14329070","14331210"," See those volume sellers stepping in right here."
"14358260","14361100"," Let me put my diaper on for 402 and spy. "
"14367510","14370510"," Hey, Joe, donuts on Twitch right now."
"14370730","14371570"," Hell yeah."
"14374530","14375090"," Yeah. "
"14375270","14377050"," No, vol has been falling off like crazy."
"14377550","14378990"," Vicks has been falling off like crazy."
"14380310","14384010"," And yet it's not being reflected in price on the spy yet or SPX. "
"14385730","14387770"," Spy now trading $3.99. 11."
"14390310","14393050"," Close your fucking shorts end of month."
"14393410","14393910"," Close them. "
"14395410","14396370"," Close them."
"14396610","14398950"," I don't care if it's now into the close, but do it."
"14399890","14401030"," Close your shit up. "
"14401270","14402150"," You didn't get your price."
"14402210","14402730"," I'm sorry."
"14402990","14404230"," You didn't get 3600. "
"14404570","14405370"," Close your shit."
"14406070","14406750"," Wrap it up."
"14407530","14408270"," Get out of here. "
"14409710","14411050"," Come back another day."
"14414110","14416110"," $3.99. 11 now."
"14416530","14417510"," Still haven't closed. "
"14418030","14421130"," The H line above at $39.99. 31."
"14436480","14441320"," So just the heads up tomorrow at 9 a.m. We've got Fed praise."
"14441540","14446460"," We've got S&P Global Manufacturing PMI. "
"14447480","14449480"," ISM Manufacturing at 10."
"14450040","14452040"," There's probably some market participants."
"14453040","14456800"," Wanting to see those numbers, although the PMI is just the final number. "
"14457840","14461020"," 10 a.m. We've got construction spending and auto sales as well."
"14462040","14463400"," Thursday the second though."
"14463540","14464900"," We've got some real vol in the market. "
"14464980","14466020"," We've got claims."
"14467080","14473020"," U.S. productivity at 8.30. Claims at 8.30. We've got Fed Governor Waller speaking at 4 p.m."

"14483440","14512200"," Couple speakers at 11 and 3 p.m. Still"
"14512200","14514040"," haven't closed the H line above."
"14521080","14528080"," I want to see where spy closes today at 6 p.m. I want to see if they close above"
"14528080","14532440"," $3.98 for those calls if somebody's buying the market here."
"14542740","14546140"," That's a cruel fate when the bot that program controls you. "
"14558450","14560770"," What am I looking for through the end of the week?"
"14563210","14565270"," I don't want to see a monthly close below."
"14568170","14569510"," We'll talk about that right now."
"14569570","14570970"," I guess it's a good time to never write. "
"14571070","14571730"," What time is right now?"
"14571830","14574750"," It's $1.49. We can talk about that right now."
"14576090","14583630"," I'll give you guys my monthly projections for quarterly projections for March."
"14585050","14586550"," If you want, we can talk about that. "
"14586690","14589490"," Do you guys want to hear about that or do you want to just talk about that on the first?"
"14591110","14592770"," It really does matter."
"14593550","14602190"," Maybe we talk about this stuff tomorrow, mostly because the actual closing price today is going to"
"14602190","14602450"," matter."
"14605490","14613350"," This monthly close is going to impact the quarter and March currently right now where we stand. "
"14614130","14616070"," Some numbers that you need to know."
"14616550","14617650"," Some important numbers."
"14620130","14623150"," I'll check SPX and spy, but I'll tell you right now. "
"14624030","14629310"," You do not for the monthly want to close below."
"14630110","14639990"," $3.97.18 and $3.95. Let me get these out for you guys so you guys have"
"14639990","14640130"," them."
"14640550","14642790"," I'm going to give you some closing numbers for today. "
"14644050","14646390"," Now you have to watch these numbers at 6pm as well."
"14646570","14647130"," They're very important."
"14649570","14651750"," Mark this down on whatever you've got. "
"14657590","14668400"," $3.97.20 and $3.95.63. These"
"14668400","14669680"," are key numbers for spy."
"14670680","14672480"," You want me to do SPX as well?"
"14673460","14674200"," You can watch these."
"14677620","14684200"," I don't think I'm the only person out there watching these numbers into tomorrow. "
"14687060","14688580"," Or what the close is."
"14688760","14694180"," I'll do SPX next for you so you know what you're trading, what you're looking for here."
"14699980","14711270"," SPX is going to be $39.81.96 and $39.62."
"14715550","14717110"," $52 and then ES. "
"14725000","14727000"," I really don't care what you're trading."
"14727220","14728780"," It doesn't matter what you're trading."
"14729680","14732100"," What's going to matter here is the market health, right?"
"14733260","14743140"," $3.99.3.19. $3.96.2.0.2."
"14743680","14745620"," These are all pretty important numbers here. "
"14746160","14749140"," So you can screenshot this if you want."
"14749880","14753960"," So these numbers down below here for tomorrow or for the close at 6pm."
"14755760","14759820"," I'm watching these numbers on this official close. "
"14760140","14768520"," Some people consider the cash market close the official close for $4.30 or excuse me, $4.15. Some"
"14768520","14769720"," people consider $6pm."
"14770140","14770700"," The official close."
"14770980","14772400"," Some people consider $4pm. "
"14773160","14773740"," The official close."
"14773980","14777220"," People have their own ideas as to what the official close is."
"14777800","14784720"," Personally, I like 6pm because they will pull shenanigans between $4 and $6pm. "
"14785780","14791600"," If you don't close your spreads, try to lock you into certain pricing."
"14791600","14797500"," So these are the numbers that I'm looking for into the close today."
"14797920","14802740"," I'll leave these here for the rest of today so you can see them on the screen. "
"14802980","14811620"," But these are what I'm looking for to plan out March and the second quarter or the end of the"
"14811620","14812140"," first quarter."
"14812320","14816880"," If we close below those numbers, it's not healthy for the market."
"14817740","14822540"," This is your baseline for March is you don't want to be closing any of those numbers. "
"14823060","14827840"," And the reason being is those numbers provide support to the market."
"14829380","14835440"," If you don't close below those numbers, that support comes up in strength on the month."
"14835680","14839500"," So consider it like a winning month and a winning week for the market. "
"14840460","14844560"," It shows the markets being bought and there's some kind of support."
"14844560","14849600"," Now that doesn't mean it's permanent support or we're never trading underneath those numbers."
"14849660","14857420"," It just means that you're likely not going to see just like a free-for-all heading down"
"14857420","14861320"," for no apparent reason. "
"14861760","14866500"," So you want to see that if you're bullish or even bearish, you want to know for closing above those"
"14866500","14867440"," numbers or below them."
"14868040","14872260"," Now let's say you're bullish and we close below those numbers today at the end of today."
"14872260","14873740"," It's not that bullish. "
"14873740","14874260"," Make sense?"
"14874720","14877720"," So you're like, ahh, support for the month and the week."
"14877980","14879580"," There's not what we expect it to be."
"14880440","14881660"," And so I'd be concerned. "
"14882140","14883680"," I would be concerned if I was a bull."
"14883820","14889320"," If I was a bear, I'd be like, yeah, if we close below those numbers, the market is weak here"
"14889320","14890320"," for the month of March."
"14890640","14895300"," And I think that's going to determine my take on to what takes place in the month of March. "
"14896980","14898980"," Is this market being bought?"
"14899480","14902120"," Is this market not being bought into end of month?"
"14902120","14904900"," Is it being bought for the next month or not?"
"14905180","14906820"," We've got calls out there right now."
"14906820","14910720"," We've got 402,000 calls at $3.98 right now."
"14911580","14914960"," If we close above $3.98, someone's buying the market there. "
"14915460","14919200"," People will tell you in social media they'll say to you things like, well, it doesn't matter."
"14919900","14924680"," Made a bunch of money short in the market and they don't care if they own $3.98. But it"
"14924680","14928680"," matters to me if they buy, if they close it above $3.98, it does mean something."
"14929280","14934020"," If they have bought the market at $3.98. So I'm looking for that at the end of the day"
"14934020","14934620"," today as well. "
"14934880","14938840"," From there, we can kind of extrapolate what to expect in March."
"14939960","14942140"," There's one other thing hanging over us."
"14942660","14952440"," And that is the likelihood of us pinning to or closing under, I believe it's 4060 into the 31st"
"14952440","14954140"," is a concern. "
"14954140","14956160"," So let's say we close the bullish of the month."
"14957920","14963740"," We could possibly expect to trade up to $4.24.30. And then have a pullback in the end of"
"14963740","14965900"," March below 4060."
"14966660","14971420"," And then the banks will reposition themselves for their hedging for the next quarter. "
"14972980","14975980"," And I'm going to expect a lot more of this for the rest of the year."
"14976200","14981980"," I'm going to expect some kind of a similar quarter just like we just experienced for this quarter."
"14983240","14985820"," And at some point, they're going to try to sell this fucking market. "
"14986940","14991200"," That's the one fear, not fear, but or I guess there's one thing to say on this topic."
"14992460","14998380"," You're considering if you have one if you have one positive thing about this past quarter."
"14998780","15003560"," If you have one positive thing about October to December and then this Q one. "
"15004120","15005460"," It's that puts are cheap."
"15006300","15007280"," Pegging is cheap here."
"15007560","15009600"," It may seem like it's expensive here, but it's not. "
"15010480","15016060"," It's not like buying hedging or being forced to buy hedging or puts at market bottoms."
"15016180","15023800"," I want you to consider that that long only hedge funds sometimes in their charters say, hey, if we"
"15023800","15026260"," get to this number, you need to protect our assets, right?"
"15026420","15028060"," So you're buying hedging when it's expensive."
"15029020","15030100"," You don't want to do that. "
"15030300","15035800"," So as a bull on this market, there's no reason not to own cheap hedging."
"15035940","15037920"," If you own anything, there's just no reason."
"15038980","15044220"," You guys talk to you guys on the 17th or something. "
"15044440","15048300"," I made a post on Captain Zalfa."
"15048360","15050420"," And I said, Estao is cheap right now."
"15050920","15055820"," You can get March, June calls on a triple average DTF. "
"15056220","15057220"," It's a no brainer."
"15057460","15058460"," They don't lose value."
"15058900","15065440"," They can literally withstand a two or three hundred point hop move higher, even if we roll over and"
"15065440","15066720"," dump this market in a big way. "
"15066720","15070140"," So my perspective for me, how I'm trading."
"15070620","15075460"," So what I leave you with is that how I'm trading this is, I think it's fine to buy big"
"15075460","15078540"," dips in this market as long as your hedge, right?"
"15078820","15085660"," If we go down to like 3000, if Tesla goes to 65 bucks, last time it went to 100 bucks,"
"15085900","15091440"," you bought Tesla, it went up to 216 or 17 or something."
"15092660","15093760"," I think on a high, right?"
"15093760","15098400"," And it's a no brainer to either take profit or to hedge at that moment. "
"15098560","15101680"," You can't lose truthfully if you do that."
"15101920","15104760"," So you're only going to gain."
"15105240","15111780"," So I don't know what to say to you other than that would be, I would say to you that"
"15111780","15116720"," at least outside of the first two quarters of 2022 puts are now cheap. "
"15117500","15123140"," So I'm going to expect at some point that we are going to deal with unemployment inflation."
"15123140","15129280"," The fed fund rate, the yield curve inversion, when that is historically."
"15130520","15131700"," I've checked historically. "
"15132920","15134440"," We could think about that."
"15134560","15138260"," If you're just 100% short, just 100% short."
"15138760","15143660"," I've seen instances in the past where we'll fucking face melt straight up for a full year. "
"15144480","15150900"," As a matter of fact, one of the times where we did that was when Barry was short."
"15151480","15154060"," And it lasted multiple years."
"15154840","15155740"," Not just one. "
"15158440","15161240"," So it's hard to say as a retail trader, it's difficult."
"15162120","15166620"," It's not like I'm Mike Barry where I can just call somebody and say, hey, I need another fucking"
"15166620","15171540"," hundred million dollars tomorrow to reinforce my position so that I'm eventually right."
"15172700","15173700"," We're retail traders. "
"15173880","15174540"," We can't do that shit."
"15174780","15176840"," So let's be real here."
"15178320","15182340"," So how do you trade this or invest in this?"
"15182940","15185140"," I don't know what to say to you. "
"15185280","15186840"," I would say to you if you're an investor."
"15187060","15188040"," We're coming to the discount minutes."
"15188340","15192620"," Free Fed Bank Board wanted 50 basis point rate hikes in January. "
"15193360","15198120"," And two of the 12 regional Federal Reserve boards sought no change to discount rate ahead of the"
"15198120","15202860"," Fed's January 31st to February 1st policy meeting, according to the discount minutes."
"15204020","15206660"," If you're looking for what I do."
"15207480","15210460"," Tesla went to Tesla went to hundred bucks, right?"
"15210760","15212060"," And I was like, I'm going to be a buyer down. "
"15212200","15216540"," I actually missed that trade on the opening that morning of the open."
"15216700","15220480"," I thought that we would go down and touch 95, 96 bucks."
"15220500","15221060"," And we didn't. "
"15221100","15221920"," It was just off and running."
"15222420","15223540"," So I had to jump in at weight."
"15224800","15226580"," I was like, I'm not chasing this bullshit. "
"15226880","15227820"," Then I ended up chasing it."
"15228520","15231040"," And I made a bunch of money, but still the idea being is."
"15231780","15232940"," My for me. "
"15233540","15235440"," And how I invest in trade."
"15236020","15237740"," I have set numbers that I'm happy with."
"15237840","15240040"," For me, I'm like, oh, I own Tesla at 65 bucks. "
"15240640","15241740"," I own Tesla at 100."
"15242200","15244380"," I'll dollar cost average Tesla at 165."
"15245940","15248340"," If I can buy some at 100 bucks, some at 65 bucks. "
"15249400","15253640"," The fact is that I'm exposing myself to risk and I'm exposing myself to the market."
"15255000","15255880"," Buying these dips."
"15256220","15258080"," I'm expecting us to roll over at some point. "
"15258700","15260880"," So if I can and we can buy that dip, I will."
"15261160","15264340"," And if we trade up here where we are right now, I'll hedge the market."
"15264680","15265740"," If I'm along the market. "
"15266560","15268820"," So just exposure in the market in the right places."
"15269740","15271120"," That's how I look at the market."
"15273840","15275560"," And whenever we go high, hedge it. "
"15276400","15277320"," It's fairly simple."
"15278680","15282420"," Right now we saw in December that there was accumulation on the NBI."
"15283340","15284520"," And we took off. "
"15285400","15286640"," And we're seeing it again right now."
"15286640","15288960"," So if we keep watching the next five successions."
"15289360","15293360"," If we don't close the flow of 395 or whatever those numbers are over there. "
"15293580","15295420"," 395, 397, those kind of numbers."
"15295940","15298140"," If we see the next four or five sessions accumulation."
"15299920","15302260"," Even in price hasn't followed yet on the high either. "
"15302500","15303980"," We watched the VIX rolling over here."
"15304340","15307480"," You can see the fucking VIX has rolled over and the spy has not gone up."
"15307740","15310320"," So that's what I'm looking for right now. "
"15310780","15314200"," Just watching that accumulation under the surface of the market."
"15314840","15316080"," And if we keep getting it."
"15316740","15318960"," We're going to probably fucking trade higher into March. "
"15320260","15323700"," And then I'll be another quarter down where we haven't fucking sold the market yet."
"15325460","15327020"," So just one more quarter."
"15327900","15332760"," Didn't do it in June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January, February. "
"15333260","15334060"," Now we're going to March."
"15335360","15336760"," How many videos is that on YouTube?"
"15338680","15341360"," How many fucking market crash videos is that since June?"
"15341360","15344860"," If you were making a market crash video every single day for five days a week for a month."
"15346180","15350580"," We got June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January, February, March. "
"15350940","15351180"," We have February."
"15351420","15352600"," It's nine months."
"15354460","15354900"," Right?"
"15356380","15357260"," Nine months. "
"15358320","15359620"," That's 20 videos a month."
"15360260","15361340"," If you didn't just five days a week."
"15362940","15363380"," Right?"
"15363920","15366760"," That's 180 videos for market crash. "
"15367000","15369600"," Can you imagine fucking making those videos for 180 days?"
"15371540","15376640"," Can you imagine looking at yourself in the mirror and you're like, I just made 180 fucking market"
"15376640","15378300"," crash videos and we haven't crashed yet."
"15380540","15380980"," 180."
"15381700","15382220"," That's fucked up. "
"15383860","15384880"," That's fucking crazy."
"15387060","15388540"," So yeah, I guess eventually it would be right."
"15388700","15393080"," But when you are, it's just another fucking dip buying opportunity. "
"15394080","15396980"," Meanwhile, the rest of us are trading the market because we're retail traders."
"15396980","15399200"," We tell investors that kind of stuff."
"15412190","15413410"," Seriously, think about it. "
"15413490","15414910"," Think about how many fucking videos."
"15415210","15416250"," That's just one YouTuber."
"15416770","15418270"," Imagine like 20 of them. "
"15418350","15420130"," That's a thousand market crash videos."
"15421090","15421990"," Fucking crazy."
"15424150","15425310"," Fucking absolutely crazy. "
"15425590","15426790"," But it sells tickets, right?"
"15427590","15428930"," It sells fucking tickets."
"15429730","15431510"," It sells tickets, sells follows."
"15433230","15434510"," All that kind of nonsense. "
"15442820","15444380"," See, we're looking, we'll wait and see."
"15452960","15455000"," We'll wait and see what happens here in a month."
"15455040","15456300"," We'll look at the month of March. "
"15456920","15458440"," Now, if we do close above here."
"15460160","15466280"," If we do close above here, my expectation is that we'll have ready for this."
"15466620","15467580"," This is going to shock you. "
"15469160","15472440"," If you remember normal bull normalized markets, how about that?"
"15472580","15477400"," If you remember normalized markets, I would expect us to trade higher for the first couple of weeks"
"15477400","15477800"," of the month."
"15478840","15482730"," And then trade down into 21st, 19th or 21st."
"15483760","15487580"," We'll trade down into the 19th, 21st, probably below 4060. "
"15490120","15490840"," Is it guaranteed?"
"15491700","15491780"," No."
"15493720","15496720"," Can you change your opinion if we do trade below certain numbers?"
"15496720","15497160"," Yeah."
"15497560","15502940"," If we open up Monday, or not Monday in the first, the second start trading below 397, 395. "
"15502940","15503160"," Sure."
"15503320","15503940"," We can change our view."
"15504660","15504960"," No problem. "
"15505220","15505720"," We're day traders."
"15508960","15511120"," But, you know, that's what you're thinking, right?"
"15511400","15512620"," You have to have a plan for the month."
"15513500","15519000"," We close above these numbers today and expect us to have a couple of good weeks, two or three good"
"15519000","15522200"," weeks, and then have some down month. "
"15523420","15524160"," Oh, look at that."
"15524200","15525020"," They're trying to sell us."
"15526760","15528880"," Look at them in here trying to sell the market here. "
"15529500","15531140"," That's two right there, one right here."
"15531500","15534660"," So one big red bar, one big red bar right there."
"15536700","15538040"," Sell rage in here. "
"15541300","15542020"," Sell rage."
"15542200","15543760"," Looks like somebody doesn't want to own that spy."
"15544480","15546560"," Somebody doesn't want to own the spy in the clothes today. "
"15549140","15549940"," Too funny."
"15551300","15553000"," I'm like, we don't want to own this shit, man."
"15557460","15560440"," We don't want to own the spy on 390, bro. "
"15561180","15561980"," I'm like, yeah, you do."
"15562060","15563520"," You want to own the spy at 398."
"15564840","15566560"," Now you want it to go to 430. "
"15574920","15576040"," Too fucking funny."
"15576700","15586640"," I made 180"
"15586640","15589600"," market crash videos and made 100 bucks off each of them."
"15592040","15592760"," Too funny. "
"15597200","15600980"," Dude, stop asking me to insert ads on my YouTube videos, man."
"15601240","15602820"," I'm not in certain any ads for you."
"15614640","15616400"," Yeah, futures have been nothing. "
"15617340","15626220"," There's rumors that there's rumors circulating that futures traders and SPX traders are trading the"
"15626220","15626820"," spy now."
"15629100","15631060"," Have you guys heard that rumor or no?"
"15632360","15633600"," That's the rumor that I've heard."
"15634580","15636700"," They like the fast, easy money of spy. "
"15639600","15640920"," HFTs are switching to spy."
"15642820","15650120"," Block creators are switching to the spy and they're trading 10, 20% scalps, 30% scalps in and out"
"15650120","15650520"," with size."
"15652340","15653780"," That's what I keep hearing in the background. "
"15653780","15655160"," People are telling me."
"15667780","15668940"," No, I keep hearing that."
"15669080","15670180"," I keep hearing that everywhere. "
"15670460","15672960"," You're hearing that from very, very good sources too."
"15681580","15683640"," You can see the data."
"15683940","15685680"," You can see the fucking data on it too. "
"15686780","15689480"," You can just see the data on the volume that's being traded."
"15690740","15696940"," We've talked about it here before or I think we talked about one morning where I said, so like the"
"15696940","15699380"," hedge funds are not the hedge funds."
"15699380","15699900"," The hedge funds. "
"15701120","15706940"," So during the GME debacle, you know, let's say someone's getting burned."
"15708420","15713860"," They're like, okay, I want Bobby to go into the Wall Street Pet subreddit and find out what the"
"15713860","15719420"," fuck they were doing in there and learn from what they were doing and see if we can apply those"
"15719420","15720560"," same techniques to the market."
"15721460","15723920"," They've probably done that with the zero rate market at this point. "
"15724760","15731560"," Probably some kind of like, we know that there's trading going on in zero dates."
"15731800","15736220"," So the past year, maybe, they're starting to move into that market, right?"
"15736460","15738340"," Like how do we capitalize on this money?"
"15740200","15742240"," It's being made, the arbitrage is being done."
"15743080","15744000"," That's what I think's happening. "
"15744940","15746900"," The numbers are saying that's happening too."
"15747580","15749100"," And then people are whispering about it."
"15761080","15763120"," I'll do a video on Winky. "
"15763260","15765460"," I'll do a video on how they can subscribe through Prime."
"15766360","15768900"," I'll make a video tonight, if I can, so they can figure out."
"15768980","15770560"," It's kind of complicated how to figure it out. "
"15771440","15773820"," But I'll do a video so you can figure out how to do it."
"15788880","15790600"," Oh, that's for that whack of the microphone."
"15797040","15797720"," Today, really?"
"15803520","15804900"," I'm interested to see where we go here. "
"15808420","15809460"," This is all that matters."
"15809600","15811280"," This really is all that matters to me."
"15811400","15814480"," This number here is pretty much the only thing that matters. "
"15814600","15817160"," If you're a bull or a bear, this matters to you."
"15818020","15818980"," Heading into this close."
"15820480","15821860"," Those numbers do matter. "
"15836860","15839660"," John Haggard is saying the 17 March, 386."
"15841200","15842500"," Yeah, I like those too."
"15843760","15848640"," I like the idea. "
"15848640","15850100"," All right, not even like."
"15850680","15851680"," We have a magnet."
"15852140","15854480"," So John Haggard just said 17 March, 386. "
"15855900","15856860"," He's looking at those."
"15857000","15859660"," It looks like we have a magnet down below it."
"15859800","15864000"," Or not down below, but we have a wrong way to call a magnet. "
"15864800","15872640"," We have a tendency to want to trade below 4060 into the 17th and 31st."
"15875390","15877810"," The magnets are wrong way to describe it."
"15879930","15883550"," Maybe an anti fucking magnet or some shit like that repel. "
"15883770","15890850"," Or we are repelling off 4060 into March 17th and March 31st."
"15894560","15898040"," You want me to take a look at UNG again."
"15911640","15913740"," UNG trading nicely here. "
"15913900","15916660"," This is the chart that I did for you on UNG earlier."
"15922470","15923350"," Very nicely."
"15923490","15924470"," It's not a one, two, three. "
"15925390","15929950"," Three trigger cluster setting high here."
"15930010","15932750"," You're going to be looking for that first stop out this previous high right here."
"15933270","15935550"," A major seller is above at 929. "
"15936610","15941470"," You do not want to stay in this trade when you get into the don't don't don't diddle places, right?"
"15942490","15944870"," It's not a bad trade on the short term."
"15945510","15947510"," See if I can make this a different color here."
"15948210","15950070"," Not a bad trade in the short term, but again. "
"15951010","15954330"," You know, some of these things we talk about here."
"15954550","15955930"," We know that the widow maker is right."
"15956670","15961850"," You don't want to be like, yeah, I'm trading this and then I'm staying in it for this for this"
"15961850","15962450"," rip higher. "
"15962470","15968150"," It's like enter, exit, wait for consolidation and something to show you above that you're going to"
"15968150","15971250"," actually start ripping face above on UNG."
"15972150","15972810"," Looking good."
"15973470","15974270"," Looking real nice. "
"15975270","15977010"," See if you can do a one minute chart on it."
"15977010","15986820"," If you want to know if you should stay long"
"15986820","15987600"," on UNG."
"15989200","15991080"," We'll just get rid of this to move this to the side. "
"15992720","15995540"," You need price needs to stay above currently."
"15996940","16003320"," 886 on UNG has to stay above 886 every time it interacts with the one minute chart."
"16005040","16007860"," You can see if it's bearish or bullish. "
"16007860","16010980"," So you're on that one minute EMA."
"16015260","16015860"," Excuse me."
"16018780","16020420"," So remember this little thing right here?"
"16020500","16024980"," If we stay above, remember I said if we stay above this 863, we're going to rip faces off and"
"16024980","16025660"," we did, right?"
"16026660","16031820"," So what you want to be looking for here on UNG is the interaction on the one minute. "
"16031820","16036000"," If it's one touch, still bullish, right?"
"16036400","16037080"," Still bullish."
"16037500","16037840"," One touch."
"16038200","16038740"," One touch. "
"16039280","16040640"," One touch, right?"
"16041020","16043040"," Got a gap above here at 896."
"16044200","16045700"," They started to close that gap."
"16045960","16050700"," Now if you start to see, see that gap above up above here?"
"16050940","16056560"," If you start to see it taking one, two touches on the one minute, it's a place for you to"
"16056560","16058280"," take profit, right?"
"16059400","16067120"," See it's taking profit below this line here, right?"
"16067300","16072200"," And you're going to look for the interaction again down on the five minute 876, right?"
"16072360","16073820"," So you'll set an alert for below here. "
"16075100","16084900"," If it by if consolidation, I think the trade will be over personally, but your"
"16084900","16087460"," sell signal is below that five there, right?"
"16087460","16088200"," Sell below."
"16092720","16096600"," Personally, I'm more inclined to like this at a higher price."
"16097260","16102960"," I'd like to see it hold above nine bucks for a much larger squeeze above like nine or something"
"16102960","16103420"," like that. "
"16105400","16109340"," You have 15 minutes right now on UNG to get a new high."
"16109700","16113340"," So if you're on UNG, you actually, if you start the timer, it's 215."
"16114200","16118920"," You have from 215 to 230 to get a new high on this one touch right here. "
"16119420","16124420"," You'll know right here if you're going to go higher and get a new high in the next 15 minutes."
"16124520","16130200"," If you don't get the new high in the next 15 minutes, the bulls are starting to lose velocity."
"16149530","16151870"," Yeah, if you want my take on the rest of the week, it all matters. "
"16152010","16152870"," I want me close today."
"16154350","16157670"," Today's closed matters for the rest of the week."
"16165030","16166470"," So far back and forth, right?"
"16166670","16167230"," We know that too. "
"16167950","16170670"," We know where the buyers, the sellers are in the market."
"16170870","16174910"," We know that we're in either an accumulation or distribution phase for the month of March."
"16179380","16181260"," Buying all dips down below right now. "
"16181360","16185540"," So if you're wondering what I'm doing for the rest of the week, someone was asking in the chat what"
"16185540","16186400"," I'm doing the rest of the week."
"16186580","16187340"," It's this right here."
"16187420","16187900"," I'll show it to you. "
"16187960","16188440"," It's pretty simple."
"16190240","16190900"," Fairly simple."
"16198560","16200120"," Buying fucking dips down here. "
"16200640","16201640"," It's pretty simple."
"16208990","16210050"," Fire down here."
"16225330","16226110"," Fire there. "
"16230480","16231540"," Fire right here."
"16241110","16243490"," 398.25 right in there."
"16243750","16244390"," Fire right there. "
"16244770","16245910"," Selling these levels as well."
"16246170","16248010"," If you break below these levels, start selling them."
"16248970","16250290"," Fire, buyer, buyer. "
"16251210","16252270"," I don't know if I bought this."
"16252430","16253410"," I might have bought this one too."
"16254650","16255610"," But buyer, buyer, buyer. "
"16255610","16257690"," Still long this market right now."
"16262810","16270420"," 398.24. So 398.24. Today where I'm a buyer again."
"16276140","16276720"," Right here. "
"16320700","16323040"," Looking at some 402s right now."
"16325640","16326720"," 402c's for tomorrow."
"16327400","16330820"," I'm sitting in 400s, but I'm thinking about adding 402c's. "
"16331280","16332780"," 39 cents currently."
"16333360","16334800"," Let's see what happens right in here."
"16335600","16336660"," See if we can add some of those. "
"16337040","16338700"," Sometimes I like adding those at the end of the day."
"16339720","16340600"," Not so early."
"16340900","16343960"," It's only 219 right now. "
"16345320","16346640"," I'm interested in 402."
"16347100","16356880"," I'm interested in 402 because that's where our next sell is."
"16358060","16358540"," 40261. "
"16362560","16364320"," So I'll show it to you here."
"16366160","16367680"," You can see it."
"16369900","16371100"," I'd like to see. "
"16372580","16374600"," There's a way to buy this right here."
"16375180","16376580"," Into the bell or something."
"16377300","16379980"," Try to take that trade right there for the first. "
"16381020","16381580"," 40250."
"16382560","16383360"," Somewhere in there."
"16383560","16384020"," Nice little squeeze. "
"16384400","16387500"," I'm interested in the first comment from Chicago Friday."
"16387919","16388400"," Goosby."
"16388619","16390099"," Look at the Friday calls. "
"16390099","16393300"," For our community college in Goshen."
"16393759","16397259"," Text is expected as well as apologies, no Q&A."
"16397279","16399119"," So text is expected, but no Q&A. "
"16400460","16402240"," One, two, three, four, the third."
"16404020","16407520"," 402s are $1.19. It's actually a better price, isn't it?"
"16408840","16410380"," $1.19 maybe?"
"16411419","16411939"," I like that trade."
"16416390","16420610"," So 402c's are currently $1.21 for Friday. "
"16420610","16421910"," 402c's."
"16423930","16425750"," It's a nice trade right there."
"16440180","16451210"," We have"
"16451210","16453450"," down here 39563. "
"16457349","16460509"," 39563 right down here."
"16460509","16467930"," And then we know here is where the real sellers are."
"16468070","16468509"," The big ones. "
"16474150","16475610"," So, what's going on here?"
"16481779","16483860"," Yeah, buying any of this shit down here."
"16486240","16488340"," Wednesday, Thursday, Friday up here."
"16492200","16494460"," Bought this, they bought this, and they're buying this. "
"16499160","16499700"," Yep."
"16501520","16502460"," Declining resistance."
"16503419","16503580"," Huge. "
"16504279","16505640"," We just look at this shit back here."
"16506560","16508020"," Look at all this shit back here."
"16510119","16512640"," Man, I want to close all that shit right there. "
"16513800","16515900"," I want to close all that right there."
"16516500","16517880"," Got all that nonsense back there."
"16519680","16520200"," 402 ain't nothing. "
"16521540","16523939"," 402 is not even like a..."
"16527619","16529140"," Are we accumulating here?"
"16529400","16530380"," That's all that's to all that matters."
"16530540","16531619"," Are they buying this or not?"
"16532140","16534500"," Are they selling this and just haven't shown the price yet?"
"16535360","16536259"," Are we going to get a minute?"
"16536480","16538140"," The key point here is..."
"16542040","16543500"," That's the key point right there."
"16543720","16544360"," That's where it's at. "
"16544939","16546099"," Are they buying this or not?"
"16547900","16550419"," This is the $6 million question, right?"
"16551340","16554099"," If they're not buying this, we know what happens, right?"
"16554960","16558220"," Down here, come down here, doin' all this kind of stuff right here."
"16559180","16562759"," The big question is, are they not buying this and we're going to bloodbath it down?"
"16563759","16566759"," Or are they buying this for us to rip faces higher?"
"16567540","16569060"," Close all this nonsense back here."
"16570919","16572040"," It's a $6 million question. "
"16573640","16576560"," It's probably a fairly easy trade for March here, isn't there?"
"16577320","16579560"," Probably some kind of a..."
"16581000","16582640"," Not an easy trade here, right?"
"16583500","16584720"," For March 31st."
"16584939","16586200"," Let's look at that trade."
"16591240","16592640"," Look at that trade. "
"16593220","16598900"," I bet you can get some pretty cheap puts down here for March 17th."
"16599880","16600840"," There it is right there."
"16601580","16617810"," $3.82. There"
"16617810","16619730"," are $1.87 right now. "
"16620430","16621490"," Kinda pricey, man."
"16637500","16639259"," I'm having some pen issues here."

"16670950","16683450"," We trade this right here, $4.04, $4.06 is $4.10. $4 "
"16683450","16685869",".09 is a working aid combustion engine."

"16699849","16701090"," $4.10 sees."
"16705390","16715360"," So you have 410 C, shocker, $1.88, no surprises"
"16715360","16731950"," there, $3.82, $1.88, let's"
"16731950","16733450"," look at something else instead. "
"16733950","16736650"," Let's look at something that's not highly traded."
"16747070","16754490"," Let's take a look at, let's look at an SDOW right now,"
"16755230","16767669"," March 17th, SDOW, March 17th, calls, 29C"
"16767669","16772710"," for March 17th, they're 90 cents, but let's look farther out in time."
"16772710","16782340"," March 31st, 29C or only $1.15,"
"16782960","16789740"," okay, so we've got SDOW calls, $1.15"
"16789740","16800760"," for 29C and I"
"16800760","16801700"," have more time on them. "
"16802480","16807360"," I got March 31st on those, it's a beautiful fucking hedge, isn't it?"
"16813740","16824050"," Let's look at June, yeah, I like the March, I"
"16824050","16833710"," like the March, March 31st, going on in April, nothing,"
"16833710","16842870"," so they're thinking that below is in March 31st, so March 31st, SDOW calls, 29C, only $1.15, I"
"16842870","16850470"," don't even have to fuck around this by, I don't even have to waste the money to get some, to"
"16850470","16858690"," get some puts for longer time, cheaper, pays better, triple leveraged, triple leveraged calls on"
"16858690","16867990"," SDOW for March 17th, $1.15, dirt cheap, basement prices, call side, pretty expensive right now, $1 "
"16867990","16877450",".88 for $4.10, from March 17th, they're not cheap, they're pretty expensive, pretty expensive right"

"17391280","17391880"," on my tray. "
"17392060","17394820"," I've been looking back on my trades past couple weeks and I think it's not."
"17395080","17395460"," I think it's."
"17396100","17397800"," I don't know that it's me specifically. "
"17398080","17399480"," I think that the market is changing."
"17400620","17402740"," I think the zero day market is changing right now."
"17406820","17411280"," I'm having to adjust my trading past two weeks. "
"17413080","17416620"," And it was the crazy part is that I revert back into."
"17417680","17419140"," My old trading style."
"17419340","17420260"," So now I'm trying to be like. "
"17422480","17425560"," I'm like I have to start to adjust here because."
"17427280","17428160"," They will."
"17430320","17433580"," I think the zero day market is going to get fucked up by. "
"17436260","17437880"," I talked about it this morning."
"17438840","17442080"," I'm assuming that there's bots out there being built to trade zero dates."
"17443100","17443920"," They're just out there. "
"17444120","17446480"," They're reducing their reducing the market says to."
"17447140","17448760"," Ten to twenty thirty percent trades."
"17449720","17451460"," Not worth chasing any farther. "
"17452420","17454460"," So where you'd hold like a zero date for."
"17456300","17457380"," Seventy percent rip."
"17457700","17461700"," Eighty percent rip and they jump back in for another seven eighty percent and jump back in for"
"17461700","17464760"," another seven eighty percent hasn't been as fruitful as it once was. "
"17467080","17470780"," Now these rips are paying like thirty percent forty percent fifty percent."
"17472520","17473880"," Then we get a roll over."
"17476180","17476920"," Reminds me of. "
"17478160","17479040"," Reminding me of."
"17480240","17482380"," Of a boiler room trading so."
"17486480","17488640"," It reminds me of reminds me of Apple. "
"17488700","17494680"," Kind of like pick a ticker that reminds me of reminds me of spies trading a lot like Apple."
"17502510","17504950"," I stopped trading Apple at one point because of it."
"17505330","17506510"," Like fuck this I'm done with Apple. "
"17507050","17507850"," I'm out of here."
"17510110","17511830"," Maybe that's the sign of a bullish market."
"17544880","17546760"," Yeah I'm losing an edge right now. "
"17547840","17549040"," I know I can see it."
"17557400","17560600"," I think the edge that I'm losing it is not it's not something that I'm doing."
"17560880","17562360"," It's something that the market is doing. "
"17570400","17571940"," Don't trust this at all by the way."
"17572560","17573140"," As a dip by."
"17576450","17577930"," Not not a dipped by here. "
"17578750","17579150"," Dangerous."
"17581090","17589290"," Well if you want to know what what what this looks like if it's not dangerous anymore."
"17589730","17590510"," It looks like this. "
"17592290","17598910"," If you don't know what what what what not dangerous anymore looks like I'll show it to you."
"17606880","17608700"," Next you want to see price come back up."
"17609820","17612800"," And in tests and trade off here. "
"17613920","17616220"," Until you see that right there it's very dangerous."
"17616680","17617360"," It's a bull trap."
"17622600","17624300"," Like you'd see something like that. "
"17624700","17626400"," You'd see something like this."
"17628380","17632530"," And let me show short price instead."
"17634630","17635970"," Let's see price come up. "
"17636830","17638930"," Trade higher come back and test and hold."
"17639850","17641230"," And then you take that long right there."
"17643170","17645870"," Otherwise this is a bear trap right or a bull trap. "
"17646710","17647790"," Until you see that right there."
"17648950","17650730"," This is nothing for you to trade off of."
"17650730","17651450"," This is bearish. "
"17664570","17666570"," Can I have ads on your YouTube videos?"
"17666850","17667430"," I haven't put them on."
"17668230","17670290"," Like so they ask me all through the day."
"17670410","17672090"," They're like you want to throw an ad in right now. "
"17672210","17678090"," I was going to I was thinking at some point of asking you guys maybe I can do it two"
"17678090","17678330"," ways."
"17678570","17679810"," There's two let me ask you guys a question."
"17679910","17680630"," I'm going to give you guys a poll. "
"17682030","17685770"," If I take a break during the day, let's say I'm like I'm taking a five minute break."
"17685770","17687110"," I'm going to go take a piss."
"17687730","17689410"," I'm going to grab a bear whatever. "
"17690090","17692230"," I'm taking a five minute break and you're watching me on YouTube."
"17693090","17694450"," There's a couple ways to go about this."
"17695130","17698230"," First off, there's a way for us. "
"17698430","17700610"," There's a way for you to support the channel that's free."
"17701430","17705010"," On Twitch through Amazon gaming."
"17705350","17708190"," You get a Twitch prime account for free and you subscribe to me and I."
"17708430","17709630"," That helps me make some money. "
"17709750","17710850"," It's not a ton of money but it's something."
"17711770","17712550"," And that's free."
"17712810","17714050"," You don't have to fucking tip me or nothing. "
"17715110","17715650"," It's easy."
"17716670","17722330"," On the YouTube side of things, what I was thinking of doing was either one of two things."
"17722810","17726550"," I'll insert an ad when I'm taking a break, which is forced on you. "
"17726750","17728030"," Now you can skip it and all that."
"17728290","17730470"," But like five minute break, I'll insert an ad."
"17730710","17737370"," The other option on YouTube would be I could do a review of stuff that I actually use. "
"17737670","17740970"," Like a review of a book that I like that I've used and I'm like I like this fucking book."
"17742370","17744270"," Matter of fact, one of them I'm reading right now."
"17744570","17746830"," I've got it over here that Janae markets recommended to me. "
"17746890","17747250"," I love it."
"17747350","17747770"," It's a great book."
"17750110","17752750"," So what I could do is insert. "
"17753970","17756850"," I could do my own book review myself, record it."
"17757450","17761730"," And where my screen is right now where you see my face, you'll just see a small video."
"17762630","17766830"," It's like two, three minutes long of me talking about a book that I like with an Amazon affiliate"
"17766830","17768910"," link in the description of the video. "
"17768910","17776510"," Now you'd still have the charts in front of you and book map plan and the new squacker in the"
"17776510","17776970"," background."
"17777890","17780250"," And if you're like, Hey, I like that book."
"17780630","17782450"," I'm going to click on that affiliate link. "
"17782770","17784250"," It would help me to make some money."
"17784490","17786290"," Now, even if you're like, Hey, I'm not going to buy that book."
"17786670","17788410"," I'm just going to click on that affiliate link. "
"17788410","17790450"," It would still help me to make some money to support the channel."
"17791030","17791950"," That way you don't tip at all."
"17792710","17794110"," The stream stays the same. "
"17794530","17795310"," Cost you nothing."
"17796390","17798450"," Cost you nothing on the Amazon side of stuff."
"17798930","17803510"," That's a way to support the channel and having somebody else actually support the channel. "
"17803570","17806030"," Having bezos support the channel."
"17806850","17809250"," So I think that's a couple ideas that we had in the background."
"17809730","17815630"," A way to support channels so that the story you're not behind to pay wall and that kind of stuff. "
"17816630","17818390"," That's what some of the options we're thinking about."
"17818470","17819410"," Let me know in the comments."
"17820330","17825610"," If either of those options you feel like is good, especially if you're a poor trader. "
"17825610","17828050"," You're like, I don't make enough money to be fucking."
"17828410","17833150"," Or even if you're like, even if you're like, I don't think that I should pay for anything."
"17834310","17835390"," Any kind of service. "
"17835670","17835710"," Nothing."
"17836010","17836450"," It's all free."
"17836650","17837190"," Everything should be free. "
"17837370","17838050"," All times be free."
"17838870","17842210"," Everything that you, if you're doing this, if you're doing this and you want to pay for it, then"
"17842210","17842450"," you do."
"17842790","17843090"," Okay. "
"17843190","17843970"," I understand that."
"17844530","17845790"," I can understand that."
"17846150","17850770"," But would you support the channel through, you know, like either ads being like timed. "
"17850850","17852530"," Like I'm like, Hey, I'm going to do it the specific time."
"17852530","17856950"," So you guys are prepared for it or do you prefer that I just do an Amazon link that you"
"17856950","17857450"," can click through."
"17857710","17862910"," Even if you don't buy nothing, it still helps me if you're buying other shit on Amazon and your"
"17862910","17863730"," prices are the same. "
"17864510","17867030"," It's just that Amazon gives me a cut."
"17867610","17870650"," Let me know what you think of that because it's kind of seamless."
"17871170","17872470"," It doesn't really hurt you in any way. "
"17872850","17873690"," You don't even have to tip me."
"17874390","17875910"," That's kind of kind of a win-win for everybody."
"17883120","17884300"," Yeah, clicks are free, man. "
"17884540","17885540"," They're like totally fucking free."
"17886620","17887140"," They're easy."
"17890120","17893860"," You mean to do an ad where I make one for a book or like a tool that I use?"
"17899340","17903560"," Well, you know what the funniest part is too, right?"
"17904640","17908460"," You know what the funniest part of it too is I'll make them funny as fuck. "
"17909100","17910060"," Like I got a fuck."
"17910200","17911380"," You guys would see what I got."
"17911700","17916480"," I got like, I got a fucking, I got a pipe and shit. "
"17916780","17918440"," Like I will do some funny ass ads."
"17918940","17920120"," I'll like smoke a pipe."
"17920120","17922540"," I'll go break out a bourbon or something in these videos. "
"17923180","17926320"," And I'll read you a passage from them while the market's on."
"17926560","17929600"," So let's say it's like right now, let's say I'm like, I'm going to take a piss."
"17930140","17935800"," I'll pop up a video of me reading a passage out of a book, like an actual trading book. "
"17935860","17940740"," I'll read like a section or a chapter and say, you know, down there in the description."
"17941740","17943500"," There's a link to Amazon if you want to buy it."
"17944500","17946000"," You know, click through it. "
"17946000","17948940"," If you see it for on sale used for five bucks, you buy it."
"17948960","17949960"," If you like fucking, I don't want it."
"17950220","17951720"," It's going to click through for five seconds. "
"17952240","17953400"," And that's what that's all it is."
"17953560","17954020"," Very simple."
"17956950","17961790"," But I hate, I hate just like YouTube and the backgrounds like insert and add right now. "
"17962010","17962650"," Fuck those people."
"17962650","17963910"," And I'm like, I ain't doing that dude."
"17964490","17965130"," Sorry, YouTube. "
"17965530","17966350"," I ain't doing that shit."
"17966710","17967150"," Sorry, man."
"17971250","17976790"," And I've done it by accident because it pops up as a box on my, on this side. "
"17976790","17980850"," What I'm watching and I'll try to click it to close it and it's like, sorry brother."
"17981190","17982990"," We're going to slam them with an ad right now."
"17983410","17986490"," I'm like, I'm like, damn it. "
"17992330","17992890"," What's that?"
"17993190","17995510"," So I'm holding the last calls that I have right now."
"17996230","17998770"," I'm holding March 1st."
"17999710","18000970"," I've got 400 C's. "
"18001710","18004210"," They're 89 cents, 88 cents somewhere in there."
"18005330","18007090"," And they just keep bouncing around."
"18007290","18010630"," They're up to like $1.27 at one point, maybe even higher. "
"18010930","18013010"," I think I checked them when they were like right here."
"18014330","18015210"," I'm in those calls."
"18015990","18017610"," I keep buying zero dates in here, of course. "
"18018790","18022490"," And I was looking to buy some more zero dates here, but then we saw that the hourly is rolling"
"18022490","18022870"," over."
"18023250","18024790"," So I haven't bought any zero dates here."
"18025710","18028650"," I want to see if we can roll this down to this 397. "
"18029130","18031410"," Before we trade above this, I'll buy some more zero dates."
"18033870","18036230"," I think I just drew it out like a crayon for you."
"18037090","18039530"," Earlier, like five minutes ago, I think I just drew out a crayon for you. "
"18039990","18041010"," Just see if we get bullish again."
"18043250","18045210"," But until then, this is all bull trap."
"18046030","18046870"," In my view, it is. "
"18048810","18053470"," Unless we trade above the white and red line, come back and retest the white and red line."
"18059260","18060140"," It is insane."
"18061720","18062660"," Pure insanity right now. "
"18066280","18069200"," Now my 400s are now 97 cents."
"18072650","18076350"," There's now 433,000 calls on 398 C."
"18077710","18079190"," Shit tons of calls on 398 C."
"18084160","18086220"," Man, they just bought a bunch of puts for tomorrow."
"18086640","18087300"," Did you guys see that?"
"18087640","18088060"," Or not tomorrow?"
"18088340","18088520"," Yeah, tomorrow. "
"18088860","18098170"," From March 1st, someone just loaded the fucking boat on 397 P."
"18099670","18101230"," 108,000 contracts."
"18104030","18105670"," Probably why we're squeezing right now."
"18116510","18117650"," Give us the ads. "
"18118970","18120790"," The ads will be funny as fuck now."
"18120850","18121990"," I'll do some crazy ass ads."
"18122150","18122450"," They'll be funny. "
"18123310","18126910"," You'll hear my deep sexy voice."
"18130090","18132250"," We'll do like a sample right now."
"18160390","18161490"," Here's an excerpt. "
"18161490","18170990"," To do my vacuum cleaner, I built 5,127 prototypes."
"18173010","18177970"," That means I had 5,126 failures."
"18179630","18182510"," But as I went through those failures, I made discoveries. "
"18184190","18185790"," That's James Dyson."
"18187770","18189990"," When he invented the Dyson vacuum cleaner."
"18193250","18195950"," 5,126 failures. "
"18197790","18200650"," Just to make the Tyson vacuum cleaner or Dyson vacuum cleaner."
"18204470","18206430"," I can't believe we're doing this in a live stream."
"18206630","18207070"," This is insane. "
"18209430","18211950"," So this book, I'm not going to tell you the book's name right now because I'm going to make this"
"18211950","18212250"," video."
"18218030","18220050"," Jim Bro commercial's D's nuts."
"18225510","18226290"," Hello there. "
"18226910","18229230"," Welcome to Captain Jim James masterpiece theater."
"18229530","18230210"," Today I'm reading."
"18230950","18231430"," I like that one. "
"18231530","18231990"," That's a good intro."
"18233330","18236810"," I was going to do the intro where I light up the pipe and I pour a bourbon."
"18237830","18239810"," Big old, you know, those big frozen balls. "
"18240650","18243050"," We'll call those bull's balls ice cubes or something."
"18248340","18252760"," Once upon a time, a drought comes over the land and the wheat crop fails."
"18253220","18253560"," How about this?"
"18253720","18254920"," Maybe some of you guys know this book. "
"18255720","18256560"," You can point this book."
"18257000","18262420"," If you know this book, say something in the comments because I'll see who's read this or not."
"18263500","18266440"," Once upon a time, a drought comes over the land. "
"18266440","18268860"," A drought."
"18269980","18271420"," The stout's out there."
"18273680","18274860"," And the wheat crop fails. "
"18275340","18276820"," Naturally, the price of wheat goes up."
"18277340","18283180"," Some people cut back and bake less bread while others speculate and buy as much wheat."
"18283680","18284160"," Wheat. "
"18285140","18285620"," Thins."
"18286580","18289880"," As they can get and hoard it in hopes of higher prices to come."
"18290600","18297420"," The king hears about all the speculation in high prices and promptly sends his soldiers from town"
"18297420","18302040"," to town to proclaim that speculation is now a crime against the state. "
"18302840","18305920"," And that severe punishment is to befall speculators."
"18307120","18308460"," You know, we are right."
"18308580","18309180"," We're speculators. "
"18310620","18316040"," The new law, like oh so many laws against the free market only compounds the problem."
"18317240","18324500"," Soon, some towns have no wheat at all, while rumor has it that others still have ample even excess"
"18324500","18325220"," supplies."
"18326360","18332520"," The king keeps raising the penalty for speculation while the price of wheat, if you can find any,"
"18333420","18334700"," keeps going higher and higher. "
"18335400","18338080"," One day, the court jester approaches the king."
"18338920","18344660"," And in an entertaining sort of way tells the king of a plan to end the famine and to emerge"
"18344660","18346980"," as a wise and gracious leader or ruler."
"18347260","18348920"," Excuse me, I said a leader, but it's ruler. "
"18349780","18355820"," The next day, the soldiers again ride from town to town and this time to proclaim the end of all"
"18355820","18363780"," laws against speculation and to suggest each town prominently post local price for wheat at its"
"18363780","18364800"," central marketplace."
"18366240","18369240"," The towns take the suggestion and post the prices."
"18370040","18375240"," The first, the prices are surprisingly high in some towns and surprisingly low in others. "
"18377100","18381860"," During the next few days, the roads between the towns become virtual rivers of wheat as speculators"
"18381860","18383980"," rush to discount the spreads."
"18384900","18389200"," By the end of the week, the price of wheat is mostly the same everywhere and everyone has enough to"
"18389200","18389320"," eat."
"18390500","18396760"," The court jester having a keen sense of his own survival makes sure all the credit goes directly to"
"18396760","18397040"," the king. "
"18397860","18398860"," I like this story."
"18399920","18405080"," The loose end, of course, is how the court jester happens to know so much about how markets work"
"18405080","18411280"," and how he happens to know how to express what he knows in an effective way, in an effective way"
"18411280","18411900"," key, right?"
"18411900","18417680"," While we may never know the answer for sure, my personal hunch is that the court jester makes"
"18417680","18426300"," frequent visits to the royal library and reads reminiscences of a stock operator by Edwin Lefev,"
"18426760","18433440"," the crowd by Gustav Le Bon, extraordinary popular delusions in the madness of crowds"
"18433440","18445040"," by Charles I'll"
"18445040","18448320"," stop there, there's more, but I'm going to stop right there."
"18452260","18453420"," So there you go. "
"18454160","18455420"," What book is that from?"
"18456620","18459740"," I should have read the rest of it, but we'll put it into a small ad."
"18460460","18465420"," And I'll edit it so it sounds like if I have to mix up any words or something or cut"
"18465420","18465820"," and paste."
"18466660","18472500"," I'll take my scissors out and my crayon out and I'll smash it together for you. "
"18473140","18477400"," We'll drink a little whiskey and smoke a pipe together and it'll be right where my camera is."
"18477500","18481380"," So right up here on the top left hand side and I'll talk to you through the market if it's"
"18481380","18482940"," like a lull in the market."
"18484320","18489180"," I'll read you a section and I'll explain to you why I like it, why I like the book and"
"18489180","18490280"," why you should probably grab it. "
"18490960","18493480"," Even if you don't buy it, just rent it at the library or something."
"18495120","18496900"," Get yourself an e-book or something."
"18500820","18502820"," So I haven't bought any zero dates here. "
"18502940","18504440"," Just waiting to see how this plays out."
"18504740","18505700"," Paris crossover above."
"18506280","18507600"," Arlie is bearish. "
"18507760","18508460"," We know that, right?"
"18510300","18511460"," Just sitting here waiting."
"18511940","18513360"," Nothing really going on the market right now."
"18517160","18520540"," I thought this was the casino that I walk into a book club. "
"18524760","18525780"," That's right, baby."
"18525900","18526580"," Row it, got it."
"18526720","18527240"," He nailed it. "
"18527380","18527680"," Good job."
"18527860","18528100"," Row it."
"18528960","18531200"," And by the way, we're going to have prizes for people. "
"18532440","18533600"," I'm ordering some prizes."
"18534000","18535060"," So give me some time here."
"18535120","18537060"," I'm going to have some prizes on stream to give out to you guys. "
"18537980","18539560"," I'll send shit to you in the mail."
"18540340","18541500"," So I'm going to send you guys."
"18541740","18542620"," I got a bunch of crap coming. "
"18548180","18549240"," Row it, nailed it."
"18549900","18551680"," He nailed what book it was."
"18555640","18558120"," I should get a smoking jacket, shouldn't I?"
"18558540","18559000"," All right. "
"18559000","18559580"," I'll write that down."
"18559660","18560300"," I'll get the smoking jacket."
"18561380","18562820"," I'll get a smoking jacket, too. "
"18568560","18570080"," And I'll have prizes for you, too."
"18570680","18572460"," I think I just saw Row it, got it."
"18572740","18577400"," So the next time I'll, when I actually do one of these things, Row it, I'll try to remember and"
"18577400","18578000"," just send you some. "
"18578840","18581040"," You guys just DM me your address or something like that."
"18581140","18585320"," If you're like, I don't like anyone sending me stuff, then no problems."
"18585800","18586060"," You forfeit. "
"18589840","18591840"," But if you're like, yeah, I want some sense of you."
"18591840","18593660"," I'll take this, then."
"18594560","18595300"," I got you covered. "
"18606270","18607330"," I appreciate that, Joe."
"18613340","18615140"," Yeah, I'll just, I'll mix it up for you guys."
"18615460","18618940"," And I'll let you know if you got, like, especially if you're like, I'm like, I'm going to get to"
"18618940","18619220"," get break. "
"18619220","18620540"," And you guys are like, Oh, fuck that cap."
"18620560","18621000"," I can't."
"18621120","18622060"," I'm in a trade right now. "
"18622060","18622760"," I don't want to see an ad."
"18623640","18624000"," No problem."
"18624220","18625020"," I understand that too. "
"18625980","18626940"," You guys have seen me here."
"18627260","18629440"," You guys have seen me here having to take a piss in a trade."
"18629520","18630720"," I'm like, I can't go to the bathroom. "
"18631780","18633300"," Because I'm in a trade with you guys."
"18642070","18643330"," Yeah, who keeps asking that?"
"18643630","18653580"," Who's J.W. or J.T.W. J.T.C.H.? Kevin James, Market Play, Masterpiece Theater"
"18653580","18653880"," Presents."
"18656220","18659260"," I think I'm looking at, I'm looking at different screens here with different comments. "
"18661000","18661780"," The timing is off."
"18662000","18666020"," Like I see the, I see the real time comments and then I see comments that are really old on"
"18666020","18666500"," stream labs."
"18666500","18667780"," I still haven't worked that out. "
"18668000","18669740"," It's a major issue with stream labs."
"18689730","18691050"," Stock trading erotica."
"18692950","18694630"," Stock trading erotica would be awesome. "
"18695170","18695770"," Blood, baby."
"18696230","18697450"," Blood in the market right now."
"18698010","18698690"," We've got blood. "
"18699490","18702270"," Bears are out for hourly blood right here."
"18702370","18703510"," We showed you earlier, right?"
"18703810","18706290"," The hourly velocity was heading lower here."
"18707190","18709790"," Bears want that blood and they get it. "
"18710390","18710870"," They want up."
"18711010","18715670"," They want a nice pool of it down here at 397.15. They want blood dripping down."
"18715870","18721170"," Matter of fact, should I turn on the bear disco ball for you guys or what?"
"18732380","18732780"," Weird. "
"18732940","18734240"," I got this thing on a cleat, man."
"18735360","18738540"," I probably don't need to wrap it so many times on this cleat."
"18738620","18744320"," Our bears going to have their day here. "
"18744400","18746200"," They're going to get their monthly clothes that they want."
"18746840","18749440"," Is Southside going to get what they want?"
"18755900","18758500"," Make sure it's secure."
"18759500","18760740"," It's not quite secure. "
"18764280","18768410"," It's getting more secure."
"18769590","18771370"," We're going to spin there, baby."
"18772570","18775130"," Give us that market blood right now, baby. "
"18776450","18779370"," Blood bread bread bread on the market right now."
"18780830","18782610"," It's like a terrible doing this."
"18783370","18783750"," Terrible. "
"18785870","18788550"," Give me that blood in the market right now."
"18790770","18791530"," Whoa."
"18792250","18793430"," Whoa, baby. "
"18795070","18797210"," Drip it on down there."
"18798450","18800810"," Drip it on down there, baby."

"18817010","18820130"," You know, there's like diamonds in the main office right now."
"18820130","18820810"," He's never in there. "
"18820910","18823250"," He's like, sell this fucking month."
"18823770","18826070"," It's fucking the 28th."
"18826070","18826590"," What are you doing?"
"18827910","18830150"," I'm betting all these AI robots. "
"18830610","18831510"," Did you hear about that shit?"
"18832030","18833230"," You're like, you can't trade."
"18833530","18838030"," You can't trade with chat GPT anymore."
"18838810","18840590"," How are you going to explain that to the SEC?"
"18840590","18842250"," You got to do this hand and see this. "
"18842530","18845610"," Meanwhile, guess who's using AI right now?"
"18845850","18846470"," The fucking banks."
"18847530","18848470"," They're using it."
"18849310","18851190"," But they don't want their traders using it. "
"18851550","18853990"," Bright red blood in the market right now."

"18877580","18880540"," Let me move this book map over here for a second."
"18881760","18884400"," You can see this hourly momentum is kind of top here right here, right?"
"18884640","18885140"," For the bulls."
"18886880","18890500"," We're kind of at a high right now momentum for the bulls, right?"
"18890680","18892780"," We're not still not seeing price correspond though. "
"18893260","18897380"," We're trading back down and retesting the famous weekly."
"18898740","18901480"," We're trying to get below the hourly back down to this weekly."
"18901680","18903400"," What happens when we get down here and touch this weekly?"
"18903620","18903840"," Do we know?"
"18904180","18905220"," Raise your hand. "
"18907800","18913820"," So far, what happens when we trade down here is we have a buying opportunity, right?"
"18913920","18916300"," This is where I bought my one dates, believe it or not."
"18916380","18916980"," It's way down here."
"18917500","18919420"," Not one dates are the ones for the first of March. "
"18920140","18921240"," So we're going to see right here."
"18921320","18922700"," They're trying to sell this market down."
"18923040","18923780"," Get underneath the weekly. "
"18924180","18925400"," Get underneath the monthly."
"18925980","18928680"," And right down here at 39711."
"18928880","18930220"," Now, do we get down and touch this?"
"18930540","18932880"," I don't know, but we have been recently. "
"18933160","18933640"," We have been."
"18933700","18934400"," We touched it right here."
"18934440","18935360"," We actually broke through here. "
"18935420","18936060"," Broke through here."
"18936180","18936720"," Broke through here."
"18937380","18939220"," But it's been a great buying opportunity in the market. "
"18940040","18942600"," We're going to wait and watch and see what happens down in here."
"18942960","18948380"," If the bears can get down and actually touch where we are here at 39712."
"18949160","18950920"," We're going to see if they can get down there. "
"18951060","18952200"," Look at that blood in the marketplace."
"18953640","18955240"," 39715 right down here."
"18955360","18956780"," Let's see if the bears can get it. "
"18957160","18959120"," See if they can tag out down below."
"18959820","18961600"," Talked about this bears cross above."
"18962080","18964640"," Told you not to trust price coming up here, right?"
"18964820","18966140"," So I do not buy that dip. "
"18966960","18967380"," Right?"
"18967560","18967940"," Do you remember that?"
"18968060","18970320"," We have short term memory loss or something."
"18970840","18971100"," Right?"
"18971800","18972320"," Sorry."
"18972580","18973220"," I shouldn't say that. "
"18973780","18976080"," Blood in the marketplace down here."
"18976380","18976520"," Blood."
"18976660","18979140"," All kinds of pools of blood down here. "
"18981440","18982760"," Weak close today."
"18983260","18986160"," 313 in the afternoon right now."
"18986540","18991480"," The bears have until 330 to get down here to this 39715. "
"18991980","18993260"," Can they get down here?"
"18993340","18996000"," Are we going to trade back higher here and give them the full half an hour?"
"18996460","18998840"," And they just tee off on this white one right here."
"18999200","19000000"," Is that their plan?"
"19000660","19001540"," What do they do this?"
"19001740","19001760"," Right?"
"19001940","19003500"," They come down here with this white one right here."
"19004240","19006780"," They just start blood just shaking us right here. "
"19006960","19008200"," Just blood bleeding out."
"19011200","19013580"," Bright, red blood down here."
"19013700","19014440"," But what's down here?"
"19014740","19016280"," If you're a bull, do you know it's down here?"
"19017280","19019520"," It has been a great buying opportunity. "
"19020860","19022640"," So if you're a bull, what are you looking for?"
"19023020","19024440"," You're looking to buy a dip, right?"
"19025100","19025900"," Where we buy that dip?"
"19027080","19028720"," Jesus, you can get cut up down here."
"19029300","19032020"," So what we're going to be looking for down here is how deep does this go?"
"19032200","19032800"," Is it really bloody?"
"19033520","19036300"," Does it break through the weekly and get down into the monthly?"
"19036300","19038460"," You want to show you something lower than this?"
"19039520","19041020"," I'll show you something lower than this."
"19041020","19043060"," You want to get bearish with me?"
"19044180","19045380"," I still got to, hold on a second. "
"19046580","19048500"," Let's turn this bad boy back on again."
"19049340","19050100"," Give me a second here."
"19051100","19052100"," Get that thing spinning. "
"19053660","19055960"," We'll give a second price target for the bears."
"19056560","19061740"," $3.95.62. And that bad boy is way down here."
"19061880","19062900"," I don't know if you get this one. "
"19063800","19064740"," It's way down here."
"19065520","19067980"," Oh, look at that bad boy right there, baby."
"19068960","19071780"," $3.95.62 right here. "
"19071940","19073320"," It's right where this last one is over here."
"19073920","19074760"," Same one, actually."
"19076240","19078200"," This is the big dip buy right down here. "
"19078460","19081080"," Dip buy, dip buy, dip buy, dip buy."
"19082380","19084960"," Let's see how bearish we actually get into this close."
"19086180","19087980"," I'm looking at it right now. "
"19088160","19091640"," You can see that we know that price is not going up, right?"
"19091640","19094360"," Well, we have great velocity on the upside."
"19094980","19096960"," Price is not showing itself in the market."
"19097140","19098840"," We've seen this for what?"
"19099040","19099920"," A fucking week now, right?"
"19100140","19100760"," Six trading sessions. "
"19101660","19103580"," Real price of spy is not showing itself."
"19103840","19109480"," We even CES get squeezed higher in SPX and spy no way, right?"
"19109680","19112920"," And these bears want to get us down underneath these two levels right here, right?"
"19113400","19116160"," And in this close, they want that bearish monthly close."
"19117180","19120480"," Showed you these numbers above $3.97.20. See right there?"
"19120840","19124300"," $3.95.63. I said I'm watching for these numbers here. "
"19124760","19127680"," Do we close the month above or below these numbers?"
"19128400","19137100"," We also know about there being 430,000 contracts on calls in this market for end of month."
"19137300","19139360"," Do they want to own the market at $3.98 or not?"
"19139580","19140400"," All questions, right?"
"19141680","19144220"," And how deep does this blood go, right?"
"19144340","19146380"," Is it just really bloody kind of bloody?"
"19146900","19148500"," We don't know yet, to be honest with you."
"19149000","19150940"," We're going to watch the background here. "
"19151560","19155880"," We're going to be watching the velocity to the downside and see."
"19156380","19161340"," As a matter of fact, I can show it here in the background, but I'm going to change this out."
"19163860","19164900"," Hold on here. "
"19165800","19170840"," I'm going to check the 15 minute and the five minute velocity and see what those look like if we're"
"19170840","19172360"," getting super duper bearish or not."
"19173780","19175140"," Yeah, 15 minutes."
"19175460","19175820"," Okay. "
"19177760","19178840"," Five minutes."
"19179200","19179540"," Okay."
"19180440","19181920"," One minute. "
"19182640","19184200"," Yeah, it's kind of waning."
"19185620","19187240"," I mean, look at the half hour."
"19188440","19190300"," Half hour is just getting started. "
"19190300","19197540"," So, yeah, they've got about, they've got about 24 minutes here of more blood, at least 24 minutes"
"19197540","19200240"," more or more blood, possibly even the full hour."
"19200240","19201660"," That puts us at 430."
"19202560","19206000"," So, even after the bell, it puts us into some bearish territory into the bell. "
"19207080","19208160"," So, here's the one hour."
"19208380","19209440"," We go back to the one hour here."
"19210600","19212760"," So, I'm going to expect that we at least tag this. "
"19213020","19214260"," At least tag the 397."
"19214640","19216020"," At least that's what it's saying right now."
"19216160","19218200"," The one, the five, and the 15 is a little oversold. "
"19219020","19222020"," You might come back up and test this one minute here for the next trip lower."
"19223020","19225640"," We are bearish into this close so far right now."
"19226600","19228360"," Overall, hourly in the half hour. "
"19228800","19230200"," One in five and 15 minutes."
"19230340","19235460"," A little, little, we're a little oversold right now in the one five and 15 minutes."
"19236000","19238100"," So, we're going to check back on the half hour in just a moment here. "
"19242810","19244010"," Oh, you're going to fire somebody?"
"19244250","19244930"," That sucks, man."
"19248190","19249110"," I didn't see that."
"19249230","19250270"," I just saw that comment, Joe. "
"19250690","19251970"," I missed that comment in the chat."
"19289630","19293470"," We'll look to see if we trade this up and slam back down off this one minute."
"19293530","19299750"," If you're looking for an entry into puts, there probably is one more above here at 397.90. More"
"19299750","19303010"," than likely trade is not over for the bears right now, not over. "
"19303990","19306050"," This is likely not bottom so far."
"19306990","19310250"," If you're a bull and you're looking for this trade to be over, do you know what you're looking for?"
"19311190","19313370"," You're looking for price to trade above, right?"
"19313510","19314830"," The one in the five minutes to come higher?"
"19315810","19317810"," This trade is not over for the bears right now."
"19320410","19321170"," Not over. "
"19337680","19339040"," I haven't checked on Boyle."
"19339260","19340240"," Let me go check on it right now."
"19345430","19347090"," Let me check on Boyle and UNG. "
"19352260","19356280"," Yeah, UNG is strong right now, but be careful here."
"19357080","19357980"," I want you to."
"19358400","19363820"," So on Boyle and UNG, be careful because the one minute is flattening out. "
"19364260","19368440"," This is when you see this, it is a time to take 25% of your profit off."
"19368680","19371500"," So be careful on Boyle and UNG."
"19376580","19379780"," The five minute is racing up right now on Boyle and UNG. "
"19379780","19383440"," The thing to do on Boyle, I'm going to show you something on Boyle and UNG, okay?"
"19383740","19389600"," I'm going to switch over real quick for the Boyle and UNG gang, just so they can see."
"19391320","19393220"," Okay, so I want you to see this right here."
"19393480","19398660"," So you see how we hit this high above at 916 and see how we're flattening out on the one"
"19398660","19399100"," minute here?"
"19399720","19401920"," You see how we got a nice big flattening right here?"
"19402460","19405300"," This is kind of bear, not bearish, but take your money and run. "
"19405300","19410200"," And what you're really looking for at this point, if your long Boyle is for this red line to come"
"19410200","19411380"," up, right?"
"19411540","19415620"," And you want to see an interaction with the white and the red line."
"19416060","19420740"," If price interacts here and continues higher, you can continue on with this trade."
"19421320","19422280"," So damn it. "
"19422640","19430000"," If you see price interact here and start to trade higher with it, you could jump back in again, but"
"19430000","19432280"," right now is a place to be careful."
"19433040","19437500"," The one that it is losing, it's losing its momentum on the high."
"19437980","19440660"," And you can actually see the difference here between the one and the five minute. "
"19441420","19442760"," That doesn't mean you can't scream higher."
"19442860","19443500"," I'm just letting you know."
"19443680","19445520"," Another thing you want to pay attention to is time. "
"19446120","19448380"," So this is 5 p.m. right here."
"19448500","19448940"," You see this one?"
"19449160","19451600"," See my cursor is not 5 p.m.? 1,500."
"19451720","19452000"," I apologize. "
"19452440","19454500"," 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time."
"19454700","19460500"," So right now, right, it is 3.11. It's got four more minutes to make a new high."
"19461240","19468100"," If it doesn't make a new high in four minutes, it's showing weakness in its trend and its velocity"
"19468100","19468500"," higher. "
"19469200","19470880"," So it'll look to come back and check."
"19471360","19474100"," It's 5 and 8.94. So just be careful on here."
"19474300","19477440"," As you get to do this stuff with me, the more you do it with me, the more you're going"
"19477440","19478200"," to be like, I get it now. "
"19478820","19479240"," I understand."
"19482760","19483500"," So UNG."
"19484280","19486220"," Four more minutes to make a new high on UNG. "
"19487400","19490860"," It'll show you if velocity is still powerful or not."
"19496580","19502040"," Spy, if you're looking to buy this dip and not sell this, right, sell the rip on this, you're"
"19502040","19503720"," looking for two things."
"19504420","19505340"," Showed this to you earlier. "
"19505600","19506440"," I'm going to show it to you again."
"19508220","19515840"," You're looking for this to curve up this line and you're looking for this line to curve under and"
"19515840","19522980"," you're looking for price to trade higher, right?"
"19523240","19524140"," Let's say it gets up here."
"19524140","19526900"," It's going to retest that one in five minutes. "
"19526980","19528260"," This is the bullish crossover."
"19528740","19532280"," If it holds, you'll buy here big buy, right?"
"19532480","19534000"," And then you stop loss underneath it."
"19534000","19534620"," Does that make sense?"
"19535260","19537040"," So you should be able to take this rip higher. "
"19538440","19545100"," Now, if this doesn't happen first, you don't just go, fuck it, I'm buying calls, right?"
"19545380","19546740"," Now you could also trade calls."
"19547000","19550200"," Sometimes I'll take trades and calls between here and here, but you're in."
"19550280","19551300"," It's like a five minute trade. "
"19551540","19552800"," You're like above the white line."
"19552800","19554800"," You take that trade, you're in and you're out."
"19555000","19555500"," Does that make sense?"
"19558810","19561130"," There's no trade here right now for bulls, right?"
"19561250","19561950"," We know that already. "
"19562650","19566470"," We also know that the velocity and the hourly is in the bear's favor."
"19566770","19569690"," We also know that velocity in the half hour is in the bear's favor."
"19569970","19572950"," We also know that we're oversold in the one five and fifteen minute. "
"19573410","19576370"," You see us trading up and touching right now, the one minute, right?"
"19577050","19578290"," We know that we're oversold there."
"19578710","19580430"," We could even trade as high, believe it or not."
"19580550","19584290"," We can even pull all the way back up here and then slam back down here. "
"19584290","19584910"," I'm not scared at some point."
"19585630","19586090"," Does that make sense?"
"19587270","19595050"," I don't know if it does or doesn't, but right now bears in control to at least 330."
"19595210","19597250"," So that's another 17 minutes. "
"19598830","19603270"," Bears in control minimum for another 17 minutes or so of this market."
"19608970","19610530"," How can you be stuck in boil?"
"19612570","19614710"," You didn't buy boil until then?"
"19616930","19621950"," I mean shit, that was how could you be stuck in boil?"
"19623030","19624790"," Trade was way down here."
"19625070","19631260"," Trade on boil was how could you be stuck in boil?"
"19631560","19632760"," Like the trade was way down here. "
"19633420","19634300"," That's where the trade started."
"19634920","19638720"," There should be nobody stuck in boil right now or you and G or any of those."
"19639080","19640480"," The trade was right down here. "
"19641300","19645840"," Shouldn't be anybody stuck in a boil trade at all in any way, shape or form."
"19645840","19648080"," I guess maybe you got stuck back here or something."
"19648420","19649580"," Maybe that maybe I'm missing something. "
"19653920","19654380"," Possible."
"19675380","19676880"," Am I still long calls?"
"19677280","19678060"," Yes, I am."
"19678240","19680840"," I have calls that I bought yesterday. "
"19682440","19684140"," I'm still longing for tomorrow."
"19685020","19687500"," I have some I still have calls out there right now."
"19689280","19692420"," I think I answered that question 16 fucking times at this point though. "
"19692800","19693340"," I'll be honest."

"19855110","19859830"," I don't know the only thing I'd say would be on boil or any of those would be."
"19861530","19867970"," I would assume that 80% of traders that have traded any of natural gas can tell you that they"
"19867970","19869350"," have gotten completely wrecked. "
"19871210","19873470"," In in boil I have I've gotten destroyed."

"19914860","19916260"," probability but fine with that. "
"19916680","19920500"," Since the reward is quite good if you really get a squeeze that's the that's the fact on that"

"21330560","21333240"," Okay It's a very good question."
"21333580","21341780"," So ready if you were holding puts right here You got torched you're holding puts right here You got"
"21341780","21347040"," torched if you were holding puts right here You got torched If you're holding puts right now, we"
"21347040","21351520"," don't know what's going to happen doing Uh, but if you were holding puts right here, what would you"
"21351520","21352220"," be trying to do?"
"21353180","21358640"," So you're trying to enter puts right here is my question Um, you could if you want to enter puts"
"21358640","21367040"," right here what you would do is You would buy puts at 39704 with a stop above does that make"
"21367040","21373740"," sense So if you were like, hey, I want to catch this next leg down The last one two three"
"21373740","21382300"," four five six instances you would have been torched six times Six times torched torched torched"
"21382300","21386300"," torched So you say in the number seven is the right time for it. "
"21386300","21386640"," Sure."
"21386880","21392660"," Okay, let's talk about it Uh, we'll talk about you buying puts down here So you're gonna buy puts"
"21392660","21397030"," right here That's what you want to do."
"21397190","21400510"," You're gonna buy your put right here And you're gonna hope and pray that you don't have to get"
"21400510","21409830"," stopped out here No, don't pray, but you have to have stops that are very tight up here That makes"
"21409830","21417430"," sense You see what i'm saying here You want to see a rejection off of this one minute Right and"
"21417430","21422230"," you want to have a stop above because if we start to squeeze here to the five minute That's above"
"21422230","21429950"," at 397 80 397 80 on the market right here So you if you get squeezed up in here, can"
"21429950","21436750"," you handle that 397 80 and the other question here is how high does it go So far 399 23"
"21436750","21444090"," has been a high Back here on the 28th and again today So that's the question you see what i'm"
"21444090","21449570"," saying here Yeah, I don't know if you understand that or not, but um, so what are you looking for"
"21449570","21457130"," here is to buy a put at 39701 And that's right where we are right now you'd buy a put"
"21457130","21463530"," right here and you'd have a stop just above it Now my buying puts down here Six or seven rejections"
"21463530","21467730"," down below i'd probably go against that trade Matter of fact, I can prove it. "
"21467830","21468350"," I just proved it."
"21468430","21473610"," See it's six or seven times If you were to buy puts right here, it would not work for you"
"21473610","21477170"," it might work once Right, you might get this trade down."
"21477350","21480890"," You might be like, hey, i'm gonna try to buy some puts here But you have to have stops now. "
"21481490","21485810"," Can you get down here sure has it worked once out of seven times six times?"
"21486050","21494590"," No No, it is not No, it's not it's actually worked to buy dips down here Uh six or seven"
"21494590","21496490"," times does that make sense?"
"21497170","21507420"," So if we're down here, this is where the dip by is Early"
"21507420","21512280"," six or seven times does that make sense like so six seven times If you're like, hey, how can we"
"21512280","21513420"," be green tomorrow?"
"21513840","21519980"," I can show you six or seven instances where not only we green Uh, but we're we're fucking smashing"
"21520640","21524480"," Does that make sense And what are you looking for into this close here?"
"21524720","21527780"," Right you're looking to find out is there buyers for this market?"
"21528220","21533500"," Been watching it for how many fucking sessions now six sessions together We're watching to see are"
"21533500","21536260"," they buying this market on lows or are they not?"
"21536980","21540140"," Are we selling the market on these lows or are we not?"
"21540480","21544740"," Are we getting price velocity on the downside on these on these lows or not?"
"21546560","21550120"," Right to get a piece of paper and pen at home and you can you answer that question at home"
"21550120","21550520"," for yourself?"
"21564620","21569340"," There you go comrades the comrades are right on The risk reward is hard, right?"
"21570000","21570880"," It's a challenge now."

"21591580","21597560"," You have to have some stops Or up here you have stops something like that The risk reward is"
"21597560","21605780"," dangerous for puts here There are more than likely call buyers trying to buy the market right here"
"21605780","21609660"," like there's a high likelihood of it Does that make sense?"
"21619440","21625380"," There's just a high likelihood you have like the probability of stock probability um I guess this"
"21625380","21669380"," is the point You know"
