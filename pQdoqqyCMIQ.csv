"77060","77840"," Good morning."
"78100","79800"," How are you, Saudi, how are you?"
"103110","104650"," Let's see if I can get."
"108940","110820"," Good morning out there if you're just joining us. "
"114230","116950"," Hope everybody's getting ready for the weekend here this week."
"117190","122030"," This week yesterday, Seder said it's not even Friday yet."
"122550","123550"," That's how I feel today. "
"123550","133250"," I think the past few weeks leading up into today has been long at best."
"135730","137710"," At worst, it's been brutal."
"140310","141550"," Let me take a look here. "
"152520","154740"," Some of this over here for me this morning."
"155560","156580"," All right."
"157480","158360"," Good morning, everybody. "
"158580","159340"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"159720","163860"," We're going to try it over and get right into it."
"164060","165600"," So, I'm going to set the chart up for it."
"165820","175500"," So, for, for things to get too crazy in the bell, we'll set them up together. "
"177580","181520"," We do know that we, we do know that we turned this."
"183900","187080"," Support into resistance as of right now."
"187080","189260"," We've got a giant gap above this morning. "
"193540","201120"," We definitely, we targeted right where we wanted to target that 3503 was turning someone into"
"201120","202360"," resistance this morning."
"203140","205860"," So, we'll see if this holds today."
"205860","215780"," And let me, let me just put some, pump some numbers in here, 390.92. We have fact,"
"215860","217900"," we'll just get rid of a, hold on a second here. "
"221060","221780"," Right here."
"222660","224060"," We're going to get rid of this big old."
"224060","228680"," Oh, let's see. "
"229980","230620"," Wait."
"232360","234520"," I'll read your comments here in just a moment."
"236880","246840"," 390.92. We are way below the pinpoint right pinpoint today is 390 "
"246840","250420",".92. Good giant gap down below. "
"254010","255970"," We're sitting, we're sitting close this."
"258850","259750"," Close this."
"262990","269510"," Book map so you can see what everything looks like this morning pinpoint 390.92. And then we've"
"269510","269690"," got. "
"270610","281560"," First port 3 to 6.59. There"
"281560","288340"," we go."
"289340","291060"," S2 is at 3,356."
"295070","295890"," Right there. "
"296690","297670"," And we're right on S."
"302370","307090"," Right on S2 typically on a day when we open lower."
"308590","310370"," I'm missing some of this stuff here."
"312710","313790"," So these up here. "
"316960","319360"," Not always, but hold on a minute."
"320940","328240"," 379.23. We'll look below to that."
"328560","328840"," Yes. "
"328980","333880"," Very look below to 375, 373 closing that gap."
"335340","337280"," So the interesting to see the open this morning."
"337280","341740"," If we immediately start ripping higher off the bell before we even get into the resistance levels"
"341740","342040"," here. "
"344140","348180"," It's going to be interesting to see if we just start trading higher right off the bell."
"348180","348580"," We could."
"349400","353140"," I always like to see the STX number if we can get it. "
"354060","358540"," Some kind of STX by or just come straight down here would be great."
"359060","363120"," The deeper that we go, the easier it is to trade in safety."
"363880","364860"," Whether you're a bull or a bear. "
"365260","368900"," You know, if you're a bear, you want to see that gap get closed down below."
"369760","372200"," If you're a bull in the yesterday's live stream."
"373400","375520"," Towards the close yesterday, we're talking about. "
"376740","378520"," Wanting to see 385 today."
"379560","380640"," We got this right in the open."
"383380","388620"," The the cool part is we were talking yesterday about being a bull and I was like, I want to"
"388620","390820"," buy a holiday rally. "
"391420","394780"," With that gap close, like 373, 373, 375."
"395660","399960"," If you can get that right, it's way more safer to get yourself a holiday rally."
"400640","401800"," It's proven itself out today. "
"401800","407480"," We also talked about yesterday and the day and the day before about how you'll see futures get"
"407480","407780"," bought."
"408060","411720"," And then as soon as you come into cash market, saw it again back here too, right?"
"412420","415840"," Just sell it right down and just staring stepping down each day."
"416380","422460"," There is an argument to be made for how big that swing was from from way up at four. "
"422840","426300"," Was that for 14 or something way back here a bunch of days ago."
"426820","428140"," So just been cleaning house."
"428600","429200"," What's the drop?"
"429200","435820"," I think it was five percent and currently we've got another one percent here and I believe another"
"435820","436520"," one percent. "
"436660","438760"," I think maybe yesterday was like five or six percent."
"439100","440120"," This is pretty big, right?"
"440320","442020"," Like seven percent after a few days."
"442560","444440"," We'll try to measure it today and see. "
"445260","447500"," And here's that last tag that we have down below here."
"448540","450360"," This is that gap closure down here."
"450540","452560"," 376.22 I think is where it's at. "
"454040","459040"," We'll look back and I don't even get that far back just to see where it's at."
"460160","461260"," It's right in here somewhere."
"462020","463780"," You can see that it was bought right here. "
"463860","464800"," We could lower it a little bit."
"466080","470500"," We just give a somewhere down in here."
"473600","480300"," So you got 373.56. We'll turn that green for the bulls. "
"480300","487540"," And you're going to want to buy this down here regardless for reaction trade."
"488840","489980"," Let's see if we can put this back."
"492260","494220"," We've only got four minutes left until about. "
"496800","498020"," And hold on here."
"500320","501900"," And get some levels in here at least."
"506810","508290"," Yeah, there's the pivot of here. "
"512070","518309"," We've got our three, our two, our one up here."
"522260","523500"," There's the second here."
"524900","525520"," Okay. "
"528200","529760"," Our one 39396."
"537990","541490"," Roughly that close enough close enough for horse using hand grenades."
"542310","543270"," We're not trying to get. "
"543270","556500"," And the last thing that I would point out to you today would be that three 98.29. I"
"556500","557960"," don't think it's irrational at all."
"558280","559260"," I'll be honest with you."
"559320","561480"," I don't think it's irrational at all to see. "
"563120","564200"," Our three today."
"564940","567920"," I don't think I mean, my mind is saying we're not going to get there, but."
"568560","573280"," It being a triple or quad witching, depending upon how you, how you look at it. "
"575860","582080"," So we got three or three 98.29. And then four one 32."
"582760","584980"," And I think that's the key point here is."
"588780","594440"," I think that Jenny Marcus was talking about this and I think his key point was they can look. "
"595960","598200"," Like one thing and become something else."
"598400","599760"," I think that works on both sides."
"600460","601900"," To where you end up getting. "
"602480","606640"," You know, this blast off right off the bell or we just start plunging off the bell."
"607920","612160"," But either way, let's say you're short here and we start blasting off."
"612640","615540"," You can get trapped in here and you know, we come back here. "
"615960","617120"," You don't have to get a margin call."
"617960","619180"," Same thing with being long."
"620140","623580"," If we start heading down levels, we come down to three seventies. "
"624280","627280"," And let's say we trade that range then for the next few weeks."
"628140","630200"," And you're on the long side, you can get a margin call as well."
"630200","635600"," You get some big trouble on both ends of this trade regardless of which way it goes. "
"636060","637420"," We're pretty close down here."
"637880","638860"," I'd like to see this."
"639020","642360"," If this wasn't a triple or quad witching, I would be. "
"643440","647820"," I would be what normally I would say we're closing this gap."
"648320","651220"," I mean, regard, I don't care what kind of relief you get in here."
"651260","652300"," We close this gap above. "
"652960","655240"," This is this is ultimately where we're going now today."
"655980","658020"," I can't tell you which way it's going."
"658020","661980"," I'm honest with you, these days can get absolutely wild. "
"663260","667560"," No reason not to see five, six percent days."
"667900","671040"," Those are big days, huge days."
"672060","675620"," So we'll get back down in here to a one minute chart for the bell. "
"678020","680820"," You can see this is this being supportive right now."
"680820","683080"," So we'll wonder about this right here."
"684080","687800"," Here's that here's that target right three eighty five oh three. "
"687920","689200"," We got right underneath it."
"690400","691840"," On the opening bell."
"693980","695640"," Right on the opening bell. "
"695640","697460"," There's this park that's right here."
"701400","704680"," I'm going to assume that Jamie Diamond is happy this morning."
"705380","709280"," Didn't even have to wait for the thirty for the thirtieth to get here. "
"711320","715000"," And from my understanding, I posted this yesterday's brief."
"716020","718660"," He starts making more money as we head down."
"718840","720100"," I'm almost positive on that. "
"720280","722580"," Nobody could confirm that for me yesterday."
"723540","727120"," I had asked people if they knew exactly what the what the caller was."
"727500","731180"," But from my assumption, he starts cranking underneath three eighty five down here. "
"733060","735520"," I'll try to go back and find the numbers again."
"736480","738520"," We got 22 seconds to the opening bell."
"738700","739940"," I'm going to take a look at some calls here. "
"745390","746870"," Give me just a second."
"749010","751730"," I haven't haven't looked at anything you guys are saying so."
"754970","755910"," Don't go up yet. "
"756150","756710"," Don't go up yet."
"756830","757130"," Spy."
"757330","757570"," Hold on. "
"758430","759090"," Oh no."
"765830","769910"," They haven't even reset the the options chain is wild right now too."
"773340","776120"," My options chain is all wonky. "
"776240","777500"," There's a bunch of calls coming in."
"777500","781340"," Like calls in out in out right now."
"782300","787680"," So I'm watching this waiting for a reprice real quick to try and not to reprice the stuff. "
"794490","798650"," For a brief moment, three eighty fours were dirt cheap and then they just went straight to the moon"
"798650","798910"," again."
"809550","813750"," I was trying to get I was trying to grab some three eighty fours and they repriced them briefly"
"813750","815870"," like three seconds four seconds."
"816570","818030"," And they jacked him back up again. "
"818030","819710"," They went down like a dollar forty or something."
"820390","822230"," Now they're back up to a dollar sixty eight."
"823090","823870"," No, they're more now. "
"823990","825350"," They're two three dollars now."
"825570","827270"," They were there were a dollar forty for a moment."
"828410","829690"," Those are three eighty fours. "
"829750","830670"," Now they're almost three bucks."
"842990","846170"," Yeah, I'm interested in the three eighty sixes and might have to grab some of these."
"846390","846590"," Hold on. "
"846630","847710"," I want to see how long."
"849910","851070"," They immediately took it up."
"858660","860320"," I hate buying right off the bell. "
"860800","861420"," Well, I do."
"861600","862680"," I would have bought that after bell."
"864120","865660"," But we'll see if we can just give it a minute. "
"865660","866580"," See if it cools off."
"871070","872030"," How y'all doing?"
"872670","873730"," Good morning, everybody."
"875090","876530"," Let me change this to the host. "
"876770","877050"," Take a break."
"877050","877470"," Crap."
"884470","889320"," I need to put something up there. "
"889440","890020"," I don't have a."
"892220","894200"," Anything really to put up there this morning."
"897900","898800"," Will that work?"
"899620","900580"," See if that works."
"901400","902380"," Well, that works right there. "
"903700","904840"," I don't know if I can put that in here."
"905580","905920"," Hold on."
"906020","906580"," Maybe I can't. "
"906760","908000"," That might cause a."
"909620","911240"," That might cause a."
"915520","916240"," A violation."
"931260","932560"," I don't know if that'll."
"934480","935560"," No, that's not going to work. "
"949960","950500"," It's Friday."
"950680","951380"," We can do this one."
"952160","953000"," See if that works. "
"953660","954300"," Goddamn it."
"970810","972130"," Seeing as it's Friday."
"981720","983300"," Maybe that works Friday. "
"986750","988330"," Let this cool off for a minute."
"994750","996530"," Looking for the volume this morning."
"996670","998190"," That's not showing the right volume, so. "
"1008180","1010100"," To get rid of Elon jet."
"1010300","1010740"," I remember that."
"1016080","1016740"," Where are the. "
"1018180","1019280"," Movies over here."
"1024599","1025040"," Morning."
"1025079","1025800"," How are you?"
"1025940","1026619"," Happy holidays, brother. "
"1028400","1029119"," I have a week."
"1029260","1030040"," You have to get you a."
"1030680","1031480"," I have to remember to."
"1031720","1033000"," After dinner today to get you. "
"1033339","1034260"," Your own room."
"1034280","1036440"," Or I'm some admin privileges over there."
"1039599","1040780"," I want to write that down. "
"1040780","1050460"," I need to get make a winky room or let him get in there and start"
"1050460","1051320"," messing around."
"1058160","1060900"," There's a bunch of calls on 390 for today."
"1078790","1081790"," There's 12,000 someone's buying calls. "
"1082830","1083550"," I'm in them."
"1083790","1084630"," I'm on 390 C's."
"1085370","1086470"," We'll see how that works out. "
"1086570","1088670"," If you guys want to know I'm in 390 C's."
"1089610","1091530"," Gonna put a price target right here."
"1101170","1103370"," So I'm in 390 C's if you want to know. "
"1112330","1114630"," There's a there's someone's buying them."
"1114690","1116710"," I don't know why they're buying that part of the money, but."
"1117370","1118490"," Probably because of the swing. "
"1159560","1161920"," I haven't checked my asked out yet either."
"1161920","1163140"," I need to check mask though."
"1168800","1170660"," Did that bounce this morning. "
"1173040","1174620"," Yeah, but right off the bell."
"1177000","1178780"," Came down a little bit off the bell."
"1178920","1180260"," It's at the highs of yesterday. "
"1197980","1199300"," Just a second here."
"1200120","1202560"," A bunch of stuff going on the background here."
"1208300","1210620"," US defense department spokesman Kirby. "
"1211920","1213460"," Seeing signs that Russia is planning."
"1213460","1215780"," Imminent moves on Kiev soon."
"1217320","1225520"," A US effective funds rate at 4.33% on the 15th of December on 150 104 billion in trades"
"1225520","1233200"," versus 3.83% on 101 billion on the 14th of December fed funds rate. "
"1233900","1237760"," Goldman Sachs head count will remain above pre pandemic levels."
"1238560","1239740"," What else we've got for news."
"1241740","1248060"," Some market participants are this is Fed Williams this morning saying that some market participants"
"1248060","1249780"," are more optimistic on inflation. "
"1250480","1253940"," Fed Williams real interest rates must raise and remain restrictive."
"1254820","1257600"," Fed Williams again wage increases have been high."
"1258680","1263980"," Fed Williams is also saying I don't see any signs of wage price spiral reminiscent of the 1970s. "
"1264220","1267260"," I don't think we've seen the wage price spiral yet."
"1267820","1269180"," We have seen higher wages."
"1270460","1272120"," Not enough spiral though. "
"1273620","1278800"," Williams is also saying that the sees the economy growing modestly over the next year."
"1279960","1281400"," The US is not in a recession."
"1281400","1283160"," I don't see it falling into a recession. "
"1283320","1284740"," Inflation is still high in areas."
"1285380","1288940"," Of course services inflation data is showing good news."
"1289640","1294020"," Fed Williams is also saying possible with the federal hike more than the FOMC terminal rate"
"1294020","1294420"," forecast. "
"1294420","1296240"," That was at 835 this morning."
"1297180","1300260"," There are clear signs that demand exceeds supply in the economy."
"1300740","1306440"," I see more factors assisting the reduction of inflation and then globally supply chains are"
"1306440","1306760"," improving. "
"1307500","1310180"," So this is just being thrown on the wall here from Williams."
"1310180","1313260"," I don't see the need for the Fed funds rate over 6%."
"1314520","1323860"," This is the same stuff we saw after the Brookstone speech where little Fed presidents came out. "
"1324900","1332040"," Throw a shit across the wall so that this is when you see this stuff from when you see the"
"1332040","1338000"," Fed chair saying one thing and then the other Fed a little Fed throwing shit across the wall."
"1338000","1341740"," This is typically to cover their asses in the future."
"1342820","1348880"," When you see them all pretty much on the same page, they all pretty much know what's going to"
"1348880","1349200"," happen. "

"2051969","2055290"," or something insane and then blasted up three or four percent."
"2056969","2060290"," So you can just see some you can just see wild things on days like today."
"2063290","2064570"," This is the big meltdown. "

"2111510","2115390"," We move sharper lowers elevated as we discussed in yesterday's am note."
"2116050","2118910"," This is because below thirty nine hundred the market is dominated by put positions."
"2119530","2122590"," If the market drops implied by volatility could spike. "
"2122870","2125570"," This is a formula for large panicky moves lower."
"2125990","2126170"," Yeah."
"2126290","2131210"," I don't I agree with that statement that they're making that we can go way higher way lower today. "

"2155810","2159530"," So again your default view here is that since his explanation is now put weighted."
"2160090","2162290"," It's more likely we close higher than open. "
"2163190","2163590"," Yeah."

"2187210","2189430"," Like when they're getting the data and all that kind of stuff. "
"2189430","2191430"," So I take that for a second."
"2201230","2202070"," Can we just say it."
"2227570","2228010"," Sweet. "
"2230010","2231290"," So she's going to get me."

"2241870","2243370"," And we'll get it in a graph form."
"2243550","2245570"," We'll see where all the puts in the calls are."
"2245570","2247790"," There's I think I know what they are from yesterday. "

"2255890","2257370"," Huge block down there."
"2257930","2260870"," But then there's a huge block above at four twenty. "
"2262730","2263250"," Yeah."
"2263590","2264170"," I think four twenty."
"2264570","2271650"," So you'll see it usually not always but theoretically you'll see this magnet of wanting to get away"
"2271650","2272930"," from where we are right now. "
"2273790","2275270"," At least into the bell today."
"2275310","2278130"," They're not going to want to monetize all those puts into."
"2279470","2280110"," Today's bell. "
"2284030","2285290"," So she's saying more spot."
"2285430","2285710"," Give us again."
"2285850","2286570"," We default view here. "

"2308170","2309970"," It stays point of fair value. "
"2310310","2313230"," This positioning also syncs with 3900 pin action we saw yesterday."
"2313790","2315670"," And the idea that neither buyers nor sellers gained."
"2316110","2317390"," I want an advantage. "
"2317890","2322570"," Following today's OPEC's the importance of 3900 and markets rotation around it is likely gone."

"2397830","2399690"," Please like and subscribe these videos if you're just tuning in."
"2400690","2401610"," That would be cool."
"2402150","2402910"," Post it over there. "
"2403010","2403190"," Yep."
"2403330","2403610"," I won't wink."
"2403830","2404310"," It's not bullshit. "
"2405010","2406130"," I really want Winky to."
"2406130","2410930"," I want Winky to do the weekly brief and do the stock section."
"2411250","2416190"," I'm hoping that he'll put out something every week that we can put into the weekly brief. "
"2416510","2418290"," Maybe email me something on Saturday or Sunday."
"2419110","2421150"," So you can do like Winky's Corner or something like that."
"2421590","2422610"," Because guys, hella smart. "
"2425530","2426710"," Take straight down."
"2426870","2428890"," But yes, straight up at the bell."
"2429970","2431950"," Yeah, that's for closing contracts. "
"2432850","2434330"," Good morning, all and dad."
"2434330","2435910"," Hey, first and how are you, brother?"
"2436230","2436890"," How are you doing, Josh?"
"2437670","2438390"," Happy holidays, brother."
"2438590","2440990"," I hope that things go well for you for the next couple of weeks. "
"2441890","2442850"," Get to be around family and friends."
"2443290","2443890"," Hopefully a hot woman."
"2445470","2446170"," I'm long short. "
"2446350","2448270"," So I grabbed some 390 zero dates and case big ups."
"2448450","2450670"," Yeah, I'm still sitting in those 390s."
"2450770","2451570"," I'm not getting rid of them. "
"2452570","2454630"," I don't I think we're going north."
"2455170","2458250"," I think they're not going to want to monetize this stuff into the bell today."
"2458810","2461490"," I don't believe that for a minute that they're going to want to monetize that stuff. "
"2466170","2467550"," Yeah, well, that's what I think it is."
"2467830","2471310"," So I think though, so I think that the 385, 382 is a spread."
"2471630","2476030"," So it only has to print like 20, 30 cents or something like that in the bell. "
"2476570","2482670"," But I don't think so the right now they're at the 385s are at $1.32. So I doubt highly,"
"2483050","2488450"," highly that they're going to print that into the bell at $1.32. And more than likely going to print"
"2488450","2490930"," that shit at like 28 cents, 23 cents."
"2491490","2495310"," There's some real wonkiness to after the bell that could happen today specifically."
"2496010","2499950"," You'll sometimes see, you know, I tell you guys on expiration days like this. "
"2500490","2506050"," You'll you'll be you won't be able to trade contracts after 4.15 PM."
"2506630","2507690"," But they will."
"2508670","2514690"," If you don't close your contracts by 4.15, they will go in and tear them down. "
"2514690","2521270"," So if you were like feel like a 30 cents or you're looking for on your spread, they'll slam the"
"2521270","2523850"," price down after between like 4.15 and 6."
"2524530","2526730"," And then you'll get a margin call."
"2527930","2532290"," Real real real wild stuff goes on after OPEX between 4 and 6 PM."
"2532830","2534070"," And there's nothing you can do about it. "
"2534290","2534810"," If you don't close."
"2539850","2542110"," You and calls for the ride to want to ask one."
"2542370","2542810"," Absolutely. "
"2543130","2543870"," I think we come up here."
"2544990","2546470"," I think we squeeze up here."
"2547830","2549970"," If I've proven wrong, we start blasting down. "
"2550450","2551510"," I'll consider it a loss."
"2551710","2552850"," Just a correction from the source."
"2553210","2555330"," Kirby is not seeing indication. "
"2555890","2557030"," Rutter plans to move on."
"2558430","2559950"," Pick up some calls here."
"2560030","2562250"," Dixie has to mark 13 aggressive by countdown. "
"2563530","2563930"," Yeah."
"2564610","2565190"," Tap the news."
"2565450","2567010"," Dude is about two times higher than your voice. "
"2567110","2567210"," Fine."
"2567370","2568030"," Thank you for saying something."
"2568730","2570150"," I'll turn that guy's voice down. "
"2571530","2572870"," On my end of my mixer."
"2573310","2576390"," I have it lower in my air so I can't always tell how it's going on your end."
"2579170","2579870"," All big. "
"2580770","2582610"," So Dixie has to mark 13 aggressive."
"2582830","2584770"," I thought that I thought that was a Dow."
"2584770","2584930"," Yeah. "
"2585850","2586190"," There's a."
"2587050","2589390"," Oh, they're selling me off right now."
"2589930","2591370"," They're torturing my calls."
"2592050","2592410"," So. "
"2594870","2596850"," It's where Dixie could be a."
"2597990","2599610"," How decouple from."
"2601570","2605750"," Not weird, but Dixie could decouple from bull saying, yeah, Dixie goes down."
"2605750","2607970"," S P S P Y or S P X."
"2608210","2609090"," Yes goes up. "
"2613240","2615560"," All big rates, low teens."
"2616060","2621280"," Focus has shifted from central banks to actual bad news earnings, et cetera."
"2621460","2622540"," The Fed is doing damage control. "
"2623820","2625180"," Absolutely agree with that."
"2625620","2627000"," The Fed is doing damage control."
"2628100","2628500"," The Fed. "
"2628960","2632340"," The Fed is being backed into a corner in my view."
"2637220","2639240"," 100% believe the Fed is being backed into a."
"2639320","2639580"," I do."
"2639940","2640700"," I didn't read that. "
"2640740","2641180"," That was from."
"2641920","2642680"," He trading shorts."
"2643860","2644840"," Let's see what you guys are saying. "
"2650140","2650660"," Let me see."
"2650780","2651220"," Hold on."
"2651300","2653000"," I'm missing a bunch of stuff for you guys this morning. "
"2655660","2656600"," The same volume."
"2656840","2657320"," So it could be a spread."
"2657480","2658080"," You have to agree with that. "
"2659920","2660660"," Let's take it down."
"2660840","2661240"," No spiraling."
"2661320","2662020"," I got 3% raised. "
"2663680","2664100"," Yeah."
"2664720","2667180"," Yeah, I don't think there's a road wage spiral yet at all."
"2668100","2669740"," I picked up some Texas calls. "
"2670620","2671640"," See what you guys are saying here."
"2672880","2674240"," We need a Christmas massacre."
"2675080","2677200"," They don't deserve holiday after stupid to ever pump. "
"2678360","2679760"," Yeah, I can see why."
"2679780","2681060"," We talked about that yesterday."
"2681180","2681260"," Right. "
"2681400","2681720"," There's."
"2684260","2688130"," You know, the market state of rational longer than it should have for what?"
"2688800","2691680"," A month, basically longer than a month."
"2691680","2695780"," And we broke through yesterday. "
"2695780","2697720"," We broke through the lower."
"2697900","2699100"," We made a lower low yesterday."
"2700360","2702460"," And bulls were like, we're going up from here. "
"2702580","2703440"," And I'm like, I don't know."
"2703740","2705300"," Like that was the."
"2705480","2707480"," That was the take that every bear was looking for. "
"2711600","2713160"," We'll look at Tesla at some point."
"2713400","2715160"," News Butler is a bit too loud, sir."
"2715520","2715740"," Got him. "
"2715880","2716400"," I turned him down."
"2717160","2717800"," Good morning, everybody."
"2719780","2720740"," Turned down the news volume. "
"2720740","2721880"," Did it turn it down?"
"2723700","2724720"," PMI below estimates."
"2725420","2726460"," Yes, it was."
"2727020","2728140"," Bro, what is this candle?"
"2728500","2729680"," Yeah, news guy is a little loud. "
"2731980","2732860"," I turned him down."
"2733840","2734880"," I didn't put so shit."
"2735000","2736560"," Big move down and barely goes up. "
"2737340","2737980"," He went to."
"2738500","2743000"," Yeah, you know, as we had chase, did you see the rut going up last night?"
"2743200","2744440"," They were pumping the rut."
"2747480","2749100"," Mr. G's out for Belvedere. "
"2749240","2751240"," Apple looks like a white family break big support."
"2752020","2754560"," I guess Apple could come out with some bad news in rally again."
"2755000","2756120"," National oil reversal. "
"2756720","2758660"," At least the whole spot is insane data."
"2759200","2760520"," Actually just needs to hit 78."
"2761000","2762160"," We'll look at oil this morning. "
"2762720","2763460"," We put oil on here."
"2765400","2767160"," I like the oil trade coming up."
"2770160","2772760"," Yep, we're going to be doing some training this week coming up. "
"2772800","2773420"," We're going to do some classes."
"2776060","2777260"," It's going to be real slow."
"2777640","2779040"," There's like a 90% chance. "
"2779300","2780020"," It's going to be really slow."
"2780700","2782980"," Unless they unless they have a market crash in the Christmas."
"2784640","2786400"," It's going to get dead slow. "
"2787060","2788700"," It's like it's like a 90% chance."
"2788880","2789640"," It's going to be dead slow."
"2793880","2795420"," 90 90% chance. "
"2797060","2799120"," Not guaranteed, but historically."
"2800020","2802000"," This soon as today is over, right?"
"2802740","2803980"," You'll see Twitter quiet down."
"2804240","2813280"," You'll see your, I don't know, stink to it and Wall Street bets and wherever you, whatever Wendy's"
"2813280","2814580"," Park and lot will be quiet. "
"2814840","2815620"," You'll get real quiet."
"2816960","2818600"," There'll be nothing to do in the market."
"2818760","2820460"," We'll just be doing classes and stuff. "
"2821940","2824020"," You're pending requests in the thingy shorts."
"2824300","2826400"," I'm going to check that right now, brother."
"2827400","2829880"," You can see my brief from yesterday and then. "
"2832900","2839080"," It's hard to get information across different platforms when you're doing like live streams and"
"2839080","2841800"," then I got a posting account and then I've got a."
"2844660","2849280"," Then I've got a, the account where I put my views out and where we should be going."
"2850100","2851980"," The ad captain's office where."
"2853060","2855680"," My positioning is and my thoughts on the market. "
"2861360","2862800"," Russia, Vida Crane, Mike."
"2862980","2864140"," How is CLs dropping?"
"2864460","2865540"," What's the middle of LRC?"
"2865940","2866480"," Yeah, we can look at you."
"2866600","2867320"," We'll look at USO. "
"2870140","2870780"," Morning, Jane."
"2871000","2872640"," See, I'm trying to get through all your comments this morning."
"2876260","2877380"," Stone calls right now. "
"2877440","2878080"," I'm not selling them."
"2880700","2881300"," I'll leave it."
"2881300","2881620"," Leave it. "
"2881660","2882920"," I'm not touching them."
"2883320","2884540"," I'll burn them a fat after."
"2884740","2885780"," No stops on them. "
"2888820","2889580"," Test thing."
"2889580","2890020"," New lows."
"2890680","2891480"," Good morning, captain. "
"2892060","2894720"," Guess you're supposed to put a coffee cup under your curry."
"2895220","2897640"," How are your calls holding the cap to get stopped out?"
"2897840","2898840"," No, no stops on those today."
"2899340","2899660"," Just leave them. "
"2899740","2900520"," Just leave them on there."
"2900720","2901440"," There are a lot of tickets."
"2904200","2905140"," I got you. "
"2905280","2906580"," I did request just now."
"2906580","2907640"," E-training shorts."
"2908940","2909840"," I'll repost. "
"2910100","2910860"," I'll repost."
"2914820","2915460"," Let's see."
"2917180","2918780"," So this is my weekly wrap up. "
"2919180","2920820"," I'll repost it right now for you, bro."
"2921540","2922320"," Hold on there."
"2923560","2926660"," This pretty much lays up to yesterday and today. "
"2928040","2929220"," I'm going to repost that right now."
"2931780","2933360"," So you can see my views of the market."
"2936110","2938110"," So let's take a look at Tesla. "
"2938110","2940210"," We'll chart Tesla right now."
"2940770","2942650"," And let me take a look at USO as well."
"2948870","2951070"," Let's see if we can meet this here. "
"2951230","2952570"," Let's start with USO and then we'll do Tesla."
"2954590","2959030"," Because I'm actually, I haven't looked at it recently and I want."
"2960090","2965110"," So this like 61 right here is $61, $62. "
"2965110","2967570"," This is kind of like the buy place here."
"2969530","2972950"," USO has sold off, but I still like this trade higher."
"2973190","2976510"," I'm still on this trade higher here. "
"2977210","2978570"," I haven't tried this."
"2978690","2979430"," I didn't take this trade."
"2979570","2979990"," I missed it. "
"2980790","2984530"," When we tagged down here, I didn't buy it and I wanted to buy it."
"2985290","2986330"," So I'm a little pissed off."
"2987210","2988330"," I couldn't get this to $61. "
"2988910","2990810"," So down here, I like this trade right here."
"2991370","2992550"," Today, I like this trade."
"2992550","3006410"," I like all"
"3006410","3007070"," this down here. "
"3009390","3011830"," This trade is not dead as people say."
"3023500","3030100"," Let's take a look at this trade on a larger time frame here."
"3055150","3056310"," So I'm hoping for. "
"3058830","3060170"," Hoping for something like this."
"3060750","3062050"," There are some issues in here."
"3062230","3066490"," You've got to get trap buyers all over the place in here. "
"3070510","3075090"," You know there's some trap buyers up in here and you can actually see if you look closely."
"3076370","3086010"," You can see that the price came up to $69.44. And it automatically triggered any buyers up here to"
"3086010","3087030"," try to get out of the trade."
"3088350","3090090"," So as usual, right?"
"3090550","3094310"," It's going to need to consolidate for a rip higher again. "
"3095110","3100910"," And oil is going to have to wear down these sellers up here."
"3106570","3109290"," I'm going to assume that you'll understand how that works, right?"
"3122080","3128800"," I'm going to wear out these sellers."
"3129200","3130760"," I have to see some kind of consolidation. "
"3131360","3133360"," It's probably a tradable zone in here."
"3134440","3141780"," You want to maintain this rate of increase up here to $67 and keep pushing through for an eventual"
"3141780","3142520"," squeeze higher."
"3143480","3145020"," This is kind of what I want to see. "
"3145160","3147120"," Something like this and then a blast up here."
"3147780","3148120"," Hold on here."
"3153330","3154630"," Something like this, right?"
"3154930","3161890"," Follow this track up and then eventually squeezing up higher, wearing out these sellers over here. "
"3162850","3165630"," So this is probably a key trading zone over here."
"3166790","3169270"," Buying dips, buying dips, buying dips, buying dips."
"3170310","3174490"," The one scary part is this turn into another leg down for oil over here. "
"3175310","3177170"," I can't tell you that at the moment."
"3178330","3182910"," This starts to turn into a huge giant bear flag in the February, March, probably."
"3185390","3189010"," So maybe I'm saying we'll squeeze up here, but I don't know if it would. "
"3189410","3192390"," Maybe it's just a matter of trading this range here."
"3192670","3195070"," Well, this is our Amazon test store reject union membership."
"3195470","3199790"," And then you get your nasty bear flag down over here. "
"3199830","3202850"," I'd still like to see at least that one big move up if we can get it."
"3203210","3204350"," Some kind of a move like this."
"3205030","3209170"," And then one of these failure and then we start selling it off in the springtime summer. "
"3216330","3217110"," Yes, that's oil."
"3217510","3218470"," We'll look at Tesla right now."
"3224730","3225570"," Let's see here. "
"3226670","3228870"," It's Tesla selling off on the belt."
"3229890","3230730"," My God."
"3231990","3232850"," Just brutal. "
"3233950","3234730"," Just savage."
"3238650","3240470"," I'll trade it up, tagged our one from yesterday."
"3240930","3242070"," We'll look at Tesla real quick. "
"3244920","3246120"," Just savage."
"3251040","3252900"," See if I can hold on here."
"3259370","3264290"," Just instantly in a seller selling trades up above pivot hits. "
"3264630","3266010"," Same places yesterday."
"3268870","3275730"," Traded up here, sold off consolidates, comes down trades back up again, consolidates, sells right"
"3275730","3276550"," off once again."
"3277730","3278990"," This is good to see. "
"3279090","3280090"," Well, not good to see."
"3280150","3281810"," This is when you see stuff like this."
"3282490","3284730"," These are people trying to get out of their positioning, right?"
"3285850","3286550"," Full panic. "
"3286750","3288630"," So we'll end up heading down looking for support."
"3288850","3293410"," Once again, people just trying to get out right now of Tesla."
"3294110","3297670"," So you've got the payment point at 157 29. "
"3308000","3309060"," There's panicking bulls."
"3309680","3310920"," I like you like to see it."
"3310920","3312220"," You want to see panicking bulls. "
"3312880","3314160"," Absolutely want to see that."
"3314780","3316140"," It's wild to watch."
"3317820","3321320"," We have a price target down below of $96. "
"3322540","3325120"," Well, the first target is $150 to $136."
"3326140","3332790"," And then I was looking."
"3333110","3335270"," I'll show you guys what I've charted out last night. "
"3336030","3337790"," The middle of the night, I was charting out some Tesla."
"3338590","3339710"," So we'll take a look at that today."
"3340670","3341970"," So that's the pivot point for today. "
"3341970","3348110"," S one for today is 153 66."
"3354360","3355240"," Right there."
"3355820","3357040"," Coming into it right now. "
"3358820","3366100"," And then S two, we've got at 149 64."
"3370600","3374780"," And then we've got 146 01."
"3374780","3384900"," Right there. "
"3387780","3392420"," We know that S two down here is a high concentration of puts."
"3393200","3394360"," So we'll put this here."
"3412060","3416740"," And we know we've got 190 calls above on our one. "
"3416940","3423640"," We've got, you can see him right here, just slammed up again into this, into this cell area above."
"3425060","3428040"," Our one, we've got 161 31."
"3430100","3430940"," Expanded range. "
"3436620","3440520"," And then our two, we've got at 164 94."
"3441520","3442540"," Get that on there real quick."
"3443160","3443620"," Come on now. "
"3446240","3451120"," And then our three, we've got at 168 96."
"3452740","3456830"," Right up there."
"3466810","3469910"," So there's your, there's your charting for Tesla today. "
"3471250","3474170"," You know, you're breaking below support down here, right?"
"3474330","3476810"," You had demand, you had demand here."
"3478210","3481370"," Yesterday morning, yesterday morning demand down here yesterday morning."
"3481670","3486790"," So we'll take a look and see if we can get some demand here. "
"3489570","3492190"," Right, right here and."
"3495650","3505350"," So we know we had some known demand down below here as of"
"3505350","3505970"," yesterday."
"3513950","3516710"," Getting a reaction of S one right now this morning. "
"3519510","3525030"," And let me bring up a, let me bring up some, see if this."
"3525990","3528610"," Oh, dude, my calls are getting torched right now."
"3529010","3533150"," I've got calls at like 10 cents and I bought them at like 50 cents or something, 48 cents. "
"3533890","3536490"," I'm down like a four or 80% in these calls."
"3542980","3544360"," Just a second here."
"3547780","3551660"," I'm going to bring up just still a giant gap above on the spy. "
"3552780","3554660"," Gaps at 389 50."
"3555320","3556920"," Three 87 44."
"3561970","3565550"," The lowest, the low in the overnight was 38 to. "
"3578000","3580280"," I'm going to have to add some more shit in here."
"3600340","3603980"," I got a, I got a dollar cost average, some, some a."
"3605160","3607700"," A dollar cost average, some calls here."
"3608220","3609960"," So don't get my ass handed to me. "
"3615600","3617520"," Okay, let me bring up these."
"3617720","3618680"," Let me bring up Tesla here."
"3620960","3623240"," I hope this transferred over this morning. "
"3625340","3631700"," Sometimes I work on one, a work on one device and then it doesn't transfer over to another device."
"3632400","3633820"," We'll see if this transferred over."
"3640800","3642400"," It didn't quite do it, did it?"
"3647000","3653780"," Just a second here. "
"3660660","3665860"," Just taking a look at the fear and greed index 45 out of 100, signaling neutral."
"3667480","3672320"," Okay, this is a Tesla chart that I was kind of fascinated on here."
"3675650","3680170"," Crypto fear and greed index 29 out of 100, signaling fear. "
"3682190","3684050"," So on a weekly chart, right?"
"3684070","3688010"," Kind of calls on the US to stop disrupting high tech product sales."
"3690160","3695060"," Going back to 2019, I'm using zigzag channels on a weekly right now."
"3696400","3703060"," You can see that this zigzag channel is exactly where we are right now, almost to a pin strike. "
"3705100","3708140"," This high range, you know that bears are wanting to get below this."
"3710500","3712840"," So you've got this to be the crash scenario, right?"
"3714260","3715760"," I'm going to come back down here."
"3716480","3720160"," Bloodbath it down to these 40s and 20s and 60s. "
"3720820","3725600"," I'm hoping to get these 90s down here for a buy, but we're going to look at it on the"
"3725600","3727280"," daily on zigzag channels as well."
"3731260","3733060"," And this is what I was afraid of."
"3733060","3737220"," So this is what I was looking at last night was on these zigzag channels. "
"3739040","3742600"," Do you see this orange line right here?"
"3743480","3748260"," I'm going to turn it yellow here so you guys can see."
"3749240","3750120"," I'm trying to say to you."
"3756340","3759460"," So when we're in trend right here, we'll wind up squeeze. "
"3759980","3764980"," If I play this back for you, this yellow line would squeeze up and down within the red and blue"
"3764980","3765280"," line."
"3766160","3768820"," And so you would see the yellow line squeeze up here."
"3769000","3770580"," Then you would see the yellow line squeeze down there. "
"3771280","3774540"," Then you would see the yellow line squeeze up here within the channel that it's in."
"3774540","3782820"," And so when you're seeing this yellow line in the center here, this is some of the implication of"
"3782820","3785100"," what can happen here."
"3785280","3788820"," And you see this violent move down right here on Tesla. "
"3789620","3796420"," And if Tesla starts to break down below the center of this channel here, it's usually pretty ugly."
"3797380","3799820"," It's usually a really fast, quick, fast move down."
"3799820","3804100"," And so the question becomes, how bad does it get?"
"3804260","3804580"," How fast?"
"3805160","3808860"," How long does it take for Tesla to get down here?"
"3809600","3813540"," And if you break through here, we start wanting to swing low. "
"3814360","3816400"," How deep does the damage get done?"
"3822050","3824090"," I don't know why this didn't."
"3830760","3831540"," Right there."
"3832780","3834780"," And this is some pretty nasty numbers, right?"
"3835020","3837480"," 131.80, right?"
"3837980","3842240"," There's calls that 150 is the current bottom on Tesla. "
"3843380","3845060"," 153, 150 somewhere in here."
"3846440","3847680"," This would be the gap closure."
"3848020","3849100"," There's some arguments to where it is. "
"3849240","3849920"," It could be right here."
"3850620","3854500"," 144, and then 150, 153 somewhere in here."
"3855780","3859240"," But if you start breaking through these, this is trend, right?"
"3859460","3860500"," So we're looking at trend here. "
"3861080","3864100"," Whenever we've broken through trend here, it can get violence."
"3864920","3868640"," And I think this is the call for how windy, where do you start buying dips on Tesla?"
"3869380","3869780"," Is it 23?"
"3870200","3870660"," Is it 62?"
"3870940","3871440"," Is it 91?"
"3872380","3873680"," Is it 133 or so?"
"3873960","3875260"," I think I've got it higher at 196."
"3876000","3880680"," But on this chart, it's going to be, it's going to be like hand grades and horseshoes and this"
"3880680","3881140"," timeline. "
"3881140","3884680"," But this is where your demand is, right?"
"3885400","3891320"," You can see trend, major trend changes on this big giant moves up, right?"
"3891540","3895720"," China's epidemic prevention control has entered a new stage."
"3896120","3899780"," And then if you start blasting through these levels, there's nothing really stopping you, right?"
"3899980","3902100"," It just gaps all the way down, right?"
"3902420","3906220"," Just gapping, gapping, gapping until you hit the bottom of this channel."
"3906460","3909880"," You do get reactions down there too, just so you can see. "
"3911000","3913300"," You do end up getting these violent moves up."
"3913960","3915140"," That's about daily time frame."
"3915280","3918520"," We'll look at a weekly tower, a four hour time frame and a one hour time frame. "
"3918980","3922700"," And you know, the one hour time frame, man, this is still violent down here, right?"
"3922860","3923440"," You can see it."
"3923960","3930140"," You start breaking through on a four hour and we're looking for much lower lows on Tesla."
"3931500","3933120"," Crash type scenario type lows. "
"3933980","3935300"," Same thing here, right?"
"3936320","3940720"," And we're just on every time frame, just looking to start crashing through these levels."
"3946180","3947780"," Same time frame right here."
"3948260","3949120"," Same time frame. "
"3949600","3953340"," I guess in a 15 minute, there's a little bit of an overextension right here."
"3954540","3956660"," You can see this large move right here."
"3957880","3960120"," This big one could show a little bit deeper. "
"3963840","3965940"," You'll look here on this 15 minute."
"3967040","3968440"," I'm going to measure this real quick."
"3984900","3987660"," That's a 30% decline, right?"
"3987660","3989780"," It's a pretty giant move. "
"4003230","4013350"," And that puts us at 139.12. And that would be the worst that we've had so far, I"
"4013350","4013610"," believe."
"4023040","4028700"," Do you get that blast through down here, that one last blast through and then it gets bought?"
"4033300","4035060"," That's this move right here, I believe."
"4035920","4036920"," This is the big one. "
"4037140","4042460"," This is back from September of 2022, right down in October of 2022."
"4043580","4044340"," Giant move."
"4055860","4057380"," Let's see if we can get out of this real quick. "
"4063260","4068080"," I'm starting to break through Spy right now in S2, looking to head lower, maybe to retest this"
"4068080","4070260"," previous low at 38248."
"4070560","4071800"," We'll see if we start to go up here."
"4072180","4077680"," If we don't price target down below 37929, and then we've got the price targets down here to close"
"4077680","4082940"," the gap at 37575 and 37556 down below here. "
"4083700","4087820"," This would be where bulls buy with confidence, at least for now."
"4088060","4091760"," If you're going to buy with confidence, this is where the bulls are going to want to buy with"
"4091760","4092140"," confidence."
"4098580","4100279"," Now I'm going to check my SDOW short. "
"4100500","4100899"," Hold on a second."
"4119439","4120580"," It's not up that much."
"4120620","4121939"," It's only at 470. "
"4122340","4124460"," The US stocks extend full."
"4124899","4126380"," NASDAQ down 1%."
"4126380","4128240"," That's pretty much where it was yesterday. "
"4128399","4129960"," I think it was at 460 on the high."
"4130720","4132180"," We'll look at SDOW real quick."
"4133380","4134779"," It's not doing that great. "
"4138120","4139960"," That's because the Dow is coming back."
"4140899","4141700"," Goddamn Dow."
"4142620","4144140"," It's not doing that great. "
"4148800","4151580"," It's doing pretty good, but it's still not up."
"4152500","4156720"," I think it was at 460 yesterday, 440, 460 in here."
"4157540","4158840"," It's not doing that great. "
"4159779","4161680"," We'll take a look at that trade."
"4174600","4176020"," That gap is not showing itself."
"4176380","4179700"," I don't know why the gap is not showing on this. "
"4180540","4180819"," Hold on."
"4185200","4188240"," There's a gap in here, and it's not showing right now."
"4188340","4188800"," I don't know why. "
"4193440","4194000"," Hold on."
"4201840","4204640"," There was a giant gap in here at like 36."
"4205480","4207200"," I don't know why it's not showing right now. "
"4210820","4214360"," I don't know why it's not showing, but there was a giant gap in here."
"4215280","4218200"," I don't know why it's not showing on this chart right now."
"4221700","4223680"," We bought this down here somewhere, right?"
"4224180","4225100"," I think about it down here. "
"4226340","4230460"," One day, we went on a high and this thing up blasted."
"4232460","4235480"," I closed some of it out back here, and I left some of it on."
"4236360","4240440"," Down in here, it was looking ugly. "
"4241560","4244760"," Kind of the reason why you don't look at it."
"4245040","4246360"," It's from March 17."
"4246960","4253020"," China's Lu says the U.S. chip ban serves no one's interest, and the U.S. has abused export controls"
"4253020","4253860"," with the chip ban. "
"4254520","4258120"," Maybe because I signed in somewhere else or something, I'm not sure what's going on why it's not"
"4258120","4258720"," showing up here."
"4259920","4261900"," This is kind of the price target here, 36."
"4264400","4268960"," There's a couple places you're going to be looking for, for some sellers in here. "
"4269860","4270480"," Let's see here."
"4283400","4285480"," 2056, I'll be looking to take some money off."
"4287780","4289660"," 3007, I'll be looking to take some money off. "
"4293080","4293880"," See if I can."
"4295440","4297540"," I think my original price target was 40."
"4298480","4302740"," According to Lu, the travel to China will be easier in coming weeks or months. "
"4306140","4307800"," Yeah, I'd be scared of some."
"4310140","4311800"," I'd be scared of some."
"4312080","4314120"," I might take this off today. "
"4319220","4322380"," See if it may be the day that I take this off because I don't like."
"4325560","4326900"," I don't like."
"4332540","4333600"," I'm in my hair. "
"4335560","4341220"," I don't like the idea of these sellers being up here."
"4353460","4355940"," We're beating these sellers out here."
"4357240","4361340"," There's some sellers here and there's probably some sellers here. "
"4372260","4375160"," I'm going to bet there's giant sellers here."
"4379500","4381720"," If you're on that trade here."
"4383060","4386920"," You're going to expect some kind of profit taking again. "
"4396020","4399060"," You're going to expect some profit taking in here today without a doubt."
"4401360","4404500"," They bought this up, came back down, bought this up, came back down."
"4404660","4405580"," They're trapped in here now. "
"4406240","4409160"," They're going to build this up, come back up in here and just try to get out of their shit."
"4410880","4416180"," I'm going to expect on this is like sellers at some point and then move high."
"4416380","4420840"," Well, you need to turn these sellers up to 36. "
"4421600","4426020"," If you want to take some more off in here and then maybe leave a few runners on for this"
"4426020","4427860"," 36 target above."
"4430300","4433120"," So we'll pay attention to ask that today and see if it keeps going up."
"4435140","4437160"," 20, 60, 20, 56. "
"4439440","4443940"," So the next dollar, dollar and a half or so."
"4453360","4454300"," Right here."
"4464240","4466500"," We'll be looking for this for this PT up here. "
"4470260","4475300"," Blue says putting Chinese companies on the US entity list is not helpful."
"4489820","4497580"," So I'm going to monitor this today."
"4497580","4499000"," So something like that. "
"4499600","4509100"," If you're in that trade, let me know if you think if that will, if you're going to take off"
"4509100","4509400"," in this."
"4509780","4515380"," We're going to check back right now on the book map and see if we get a reaction up this"
"4515380","4519140"," previous low here at 382 47."
"4526560","4528060"," We're going to watch book map right here. "
"4528060","4548140"," I'm"
"4548140","4558040"," going to watch my, my SDOW here."
"4565600","4573860"," Blasting through 3, 2, like it's butter closing the gap down below the"
"4573860","4583800"," retest of the low at 548 this morning, like butter nothing looking at target down below of 3"
"4583800","4585000"," 79 29."
"4585000","4590220"," And then closing the gap down at 373, 375 here. "
"4592060","4593680"," Just blasting here."
"4594180","4597380"," Absolutely nothing holding up this market here until down to 373."
"4598560","4599240"," Nothing. "
"4600040","4601340"," Absolutely nothing."
"4603500","4607060"," Price target right down there, 375, 75."
"4607980","4609680"," Market should start blasting down here. "
"4609680","4613560"," We're not seeing any kind of reaction any kind of demand here."
"4613860","4617080"," We should head right down to 375, 373, 56."
"4625420","4627180"," We'll follow this down right here. "
"4628040","4629800"," Nothing holding this market down up."
"4630200","4631080"," Absolutely nothing."
"4631080","4631180"," Nothing. "
"4636500","4644600"," Yeah, so the JPM, I've got, let me look at the post that I got there with the targets on"
"4644600","4645000"," JPM."
"4659130","4668930"," So you've got targets on, nobody could confirm or deny this yesterday, but 3335 is the JPM target."
"4668930","4673750"," Nobody could confirm this yesterday, but I believe 3750. "
"4675110","4678110"," So somewhere down in here, they start cranking."
"4678290","4680050"," They start like making bank down here."
"4682130","4685230"," And 33090 is, this is the part that I couldn't get confirmed. "
"4686550","4692390"," Was that 33390 is the lower bound of the collar for December 30th."
"4693330","4700330"," Now, if you start seeing those numbers down below 3390, that's definitely, would you call that"
"4700330","4701590"," market crash territory, right?"
"4702170","4703690"," You'd see that into the 30th."
"4704030","4709310"," If anybody can confirm or deny that the lower bound of that trade is down there at 3390. "
"4717790","4724270"," Yeah, I've got a, I've got my SDOW calls are now for 70."
"4724530","4725470"," So they're cranking right now."
"4726470","4729550"," I'm going to check my, let me check my calls. "
"4748530","4752470"," Yeah, I bought a bunch at 50 cents, I think, and then I bought a bunch at like nine or"
"4752470","4753110"," 10 cents."
"4753670","4755070"," And they're now down to five cents."
"4755270","4755850"," They're almost worthless. "
"4757390","4758770"," Torched, absolutely torched."
"4760990","4763910"," And from my perspective, we're coming down here."
"4763990","4765450"," We're going to come down here and close this. "
"4765910","4767690"," This is all free falling down here."
"4767690","4770750"," There's absolutely nothing here holding this, holding this area up here."
"4771110","4778470"," If you go back to the monthly here, absolutely nothing holding this up down here. "
"4780290","4781290"," Let's go back here."
"4781350","4782410"," You can just see it right here."
"4782990","4783930"," Absolutely nothing. "
"4784470","4785650"," Nothing holding this up."
"4785830","4791970"," You can see this whole entire move right here is all just pre market, you know, low, low, low"
"4791970","4792510"," volume."
"4793590","4795510"," Nobody fighting it in here. "
"4795670","4797970"," They just have low liquidity environments like this."
"4798470","4800750"," This is all just nonsense pushed up."
"4801610","4804010"," So you should more than likely see this 375. "
"4805330","4806150"," Get tagged."
"4806510","4810650"," There was some demand down below here and there was some demand right here."
"4811070","4814910"," This is between this three 69, 373. "
"4816110","4821450"," We've got a green box over here at 373 and 375 to even test this."
"4821450","4823910"," If this starts to break at any point, right?"
"4824150","4827450"," I swear, JPM caller goes all the way down to 3,300."
"4828110","4831730"," You're talking about some pretty big levels to be breaking through back here. "
"4832950","4836610"," And that's all this demand down here would be gone, 358."
"4837350","4839630"," And then you'd be testing the weekly moving average."
"4840350","4841410"," We'll take a look at that. "
"4842150","4844110"," And that is way down here."
"4845750","4847250"," You guys can't see some of this stuff."
"4847250","4852690"," I showed this yesterday, right?"
"4856090","4860130"," You've got this real demand down below here, 373, 370. "
"4861110","4864290"," And then you've got down below here at 355, 358."
"4865310","4867250"," And this is that weekly moving average, right?"
"4867450","4867990"," You see this here."
"4868770","4871350"," We talked yesterday about slipping below this. "
"4872170","4876510"," You start seeing a slip below this weekly moving average."
"4877250","4880390"," We know that anything below this is crash territory."
"4881230","4882650"," You don't recover from this. "
"4882790","4883810"," This is some where you start hitting."
"4884070","4890390"," You can get rid of 3,200 and you'll start seeing lower lows, like 2,600 stuff like that."
"4891070","4891750"," You can get pretty wild. "
"4900590","4902670"," Move this over so you can see it."
"4906810","4909890"," Big, nice red bar in here at 1034."
"4910690","4912130"," Just blast right through. "
"4913750","4915390"," Good job to the Bears."
"4916430","4917330"," Outstanding Bears."
"4917750","4918950"," Bears must be stoked this morning. "
"4918950","4922110"," It makes me wonder how many bears are actually short in here."
"4922470","4926050"," I saw bears yesterday saying that they closed short positions."
"4926830","4928730"," They closed, put positions. "
"4930790","4933370"," So I'm wondering if bears are still making money."
"4933650","4935690"," Or release retail bears or if they are not."
"4939350","4941350"," Let's see if I can get that closed up a little bit. "
"4949750","4953770"," Let's see if we can put some places for these bears to"
"4953770","4961030"," keep this heading down here."
"4969370","4977350"," The Bank of England sold 3-spot 0-972 billion sterling of gilts at sales window for long dated and"
"4977350","4978290"," index linked gilts."
"4978850","4986770"," The Bank of England sold a total of Bank of England received bids worth 3-spot 449 billion pounds"
"4986770","4990270"," of gilts at sales window for long dated and index linked gilts. "
"4994450","4997570"," I'm going to make this so it can be transparent so it's not so thick."
"4997750","4999690"," You guys can see what's going on in here."
"5003170","5005050"," This is the current track though, man. "
"5005190","5005770"," Look at that track."
"5006770","5007410"," That's insane."
"5010990","5014810"," Just came up here in S1 said, fuck no, came right back down. "
"5015290","5019890"," Took S2, blasted through the previous low from the early morning."
"5020590","5026090"," Now looking to get down to S3 at 3.79.29. Hopefully the bears can get down way down to"
"5026090","5029850"," 3.73. Close the gap with 3.75, 3.73 this morning."
"5030610","5033130"," We'll see if they can finish the day out nice and strong here. "
"5037250","5039050"," Two you guys are saying here."
"5040410","5041950"," To test a break, I didn't even look."
"5042830","5044450"," Let me bring up a chart. "
"5063930","5065590"," Oh, Tesla baby."
"5067410","5069570"," Let's look at Tesla real quick."
"5077910","5080590"," So this is the Tesla chart over here. "
"5083190","5088210"," This is where the buys were in pre-market on yesterday on Tesla."
"5089210","5094270"," There were two huge buys made two big giant green bars on Tesla."
"5094270","5095690"," We'll see if there's a reaction here. "
"5095890","5099250"," I'm going to assume that this was that."
"5099670","5101090"," I'm going to assume that this was."
"5106710","5108030"," Who was his name?"
"5113050","5114270"," I forget his name. "
"5114450","5120470"," He said friends, I just put in 500 plus million dollars on the line for 3 million shares."
"5120650","5121410"," I may know who this guy is."
"5121450","5122130"," He's one of the original. "
"5122850","5123810"," The OG Tesla investors."
"5125430","5132730"," He put 500 plus million on the line for more than 3 million shares of Tesla at 160 bucks."
"5133330","5134410"," So he's in up here. "
"5136590","5137970"," He's in right up here."
"5138710","5143170"," Mostly real sacrifice because Tesla stocks are Tesla stocks are falling knives."
"5143790","5144750"," Imagine you're a billionaire. "
"5145070","5148790"," You could not and would not put 500 million on the line to buy the falling knives."
"5149350","5150990"," Unless you're committing some puko."
"5151310","5153770"," I am not, but it is a crazy act. "
"5154250","5156850"," Heroic but stupid because I'm committed to 100% with Tesla."
"5157610","5157910"," Not Elon."
"5158190","5159130"," I need hugs and love Leo. "
"5159850","5163010"," So Leo says he bought way up here at 160."
"5163810","5164730"," Straight shares."
"5166150","5169210"," As he's probably looking at this right now wondering if it's coming back. "
"5172010","5173150"," We'll see it."
"5173210","5175370"," We'll see if this holds down here for Tesla or not."
"5179550","5183210"," I'm surprised to wait for 190 or why he bought so much at 160. "
"5183810","5189050"," Is that like 10% of his net wealth or is it like 50% of his net wealth?"
"5191110","5193790"," Getting a reaction trade right down here in Tesla right now."
"5194290","5195070"," See if this holds."
"5195950","5200130"," Doesn't look too, doesn't look too, let's see what the volume is on it. "
"5202630","5204430"," That's this nice capitulation down here."
"5204930","5207030"," 2 million, 3 million is pretty good actually."
"5207450","5207830"," It's not bad. "
"5211730","5213310"," Wicks being bought right up right here."
"5213410","5214970"," We'll see what this 15 minute candle says."
"5216190","5217070"," This turns green. "
"5217270","5219750"," It should be a bottom ish for Tesla still."
"5223030","5224010"," We'll see if this turns."
"5224150","5224490"," You have turns. "
"5224930","5225550"," Stays red man."
"5226250","5226730"," Not good."
"5227210","5231310"," Boles are winning this candle right now so we'll see if the bulls take over on this 15 minute. "
"5231310","5232250"," The 5 minute looks great."
"5232950","5236030"," I will see if the 15 minute does as well or if it doesn't."
"5236970","5238730"," Might be a trade here for Tesla bulls. "
"5241010","5243770"," You want to see this but you don't want to see this candle stay red."
"5243770","5247030"," You want to see this candle in the 15 minute turn green."
"5248050","5252570"," You want to see definitive commitment from bulls to be buying down here once again. "
"5262530","5266850"," This is the spy chart."
"5268710","5270690"," Sweet calls are coming back again."
"5270690","5274310"," Again, some life back in these calls that I've got. "
"5274490","5279770"," I've got sitting on esto triple leveraged calls on 25 c for."
"5281250","5285570"," March 17th and then I'm sitting on some zero dates for today."
"5286330","5287570"," Still believing we go up here. "
"5288330","5290350"," I want to see all this gap get closed today."
"5293750","5294730"," It's a lot of tickets."
"5304830","5305530"," Let me see. "
"5305790","5307350"," You're up 6% on esto."
"5308770","5310910"," Yeah, I'm not going to go look at my position."
"5314410","5316010"," We could close down here. "
"5316110","5317050"," That's looking like real ugly."
"5317530","5320050"," A wick candle getting torched from my 3dcs."
"5320370","5321290"," Luckily, about a few cents. "
"5321570","5323690"," We'll take out some profit today."
"5323890","5324390"," Holy volume."
"5324690","5328190"," Spas is going to gpm 385 35 pin. "
"5328690","5330370"," Don't sleep on gpm pin."
"5330790","5331810"," It's not going there made."
"5332390","5334450"," I mean, I should take profit in these three and a five foot. "
"5334710","5338350"," Yeah, I was wondering if I should take profit on esto today as well."
"5338350","5340830"," I'm going to keep track of it here today."
"5340970","5341850"," If we can get it up to. "
"5343270","5344090"," We can get."
"5349350","5351670"," We're going to bring it up on this on this chart."
"5352090","5354090"," I mean, this is a huge day, right?"
"5359250","5360850"," We're 2797 now. "
"5361150","5362710"," If esto goes up another buck."
"5364250","5365030"," It's in that."
"5365170","5365970"," It's in this area. "
"5368750","5369530"," There'll be sellers."
"5369770","5371870"," I know there'll be sellers that we profit taking coming down here."
"5372310","5374290"," It's like a almost 100% chance that you'll get. "
"5374850","5378710"," This is the low end of profit taking down here at 2856, but."
"5381810","5384570"," I'm almost positively profit taking coming in here."
"5384670","5385290"," Not profit taking. "
"5385650","5388450"," There'll be sellers from big trap from before."
"5389570","5390010"," On esto."
"5391090","5392530"," I might close that. "
"5392610","5395450"," If we can get asked up 2856, I'll close it today."
"5396950","5398790"," I'll take the money and run and look for."
"5399010","5401190"," I'll look for to reenter again. "
"5403210","5405230"," I mean, look at that move, dude."
"5407210","5408830"," It's a huge move right there."
"5410670","5411630"," Huge move. "
"5416510","5417770"," That's it right there."
"5417770","5419390"," You see that right there?"
"5420030","5421190"," We're so close."
"5423410","5431450"," If this was like a TLT, I would say we'll probably nail up here, but I can't tell right just"
"5431450","5431690"," yet. "
"5435830","5437030"," That's a giant move."
"5439450","5441290"," This is all giant moves right here."
"5442030","5443150"," I don't know. "
"5443450","5444530"," If you're in esto, start."
"5449010","5450830"," It's consolidation right here."
"5451010","5452630"," Do we just need one more blast up?"
"5455650","5457470"," I'll probably exit the position. "
"5463010","5463990"," Spies telling it's reversing."
"5465790","5475710"," If we get the reversal here, if the bears can hold on and sell this down for the wind"
"5475710","5478130"," down here, I'll definitely close it."
"5494830","5496910"," Bring this in so you can see it better. "
"5501850","5503650"," I'll ask you guys in the chat."
"5505310","5505510"," Let me"
"5505510","5517770"," ask"
"5517770","5519830"," you guys in the chat if you think we can get down here."
"5526750","5529990"," If we close the key, can we close the gap today?"
"5530450","5531070"," That's what I want to know. "
"5539730","5540710"," Just a second here."
"5542090","5544270"," I'm going to pose a question to you right now."
"5546850","5547670"," Start a pull. "
"5547830","5548890"," Can we close the gap?"
"5555250","5556110"," Just a second."
"5556250","5557090"," Can we close the gap?"
"5558510","5560010"," We got the cap blocks out here."
"5566530","5576270"," Between 375, we'll call it 0 "
"5576270","5589990",".75, right?"
"5592990","5593430"," Today. "
"5596970","5597850"," Or Monday."
"5601510","5605190"," Okay, so I'm asking this because I want to close the, I want to close S now at some point."
"5609670","5613250"," Just a yes, no, yes, no, yes, no question. "
"5614350","5616090"," Can we close the gap down below?"
"5617590","5619110"," So up here at S2, right?"
"5619510","5620930"," You can see we're very bearish."
"5621090","5622610"," I don't know if you know that, you're bull."
"5624130","5628110"," Below the pivot points, we rejected the media lock S1, right?"
"5628610","5637230"," Rejected off of S2 came down and first broke the early morning demand that was in premarket. "
"5638930","5641970"," So as soon as you broke, or soon as you broke here, it's opening the door."
"5642110","5645890"," It's telling you the door is open for S3 down below here."
"5646630","5648910"," We're just looking for some shorts to cover. "
"5649570","5652170"," Some more puts to roll in to get down here to S3."
"5654050","5656130"," Do we actually get down here to 373?"
"5657090","5662550"," Close the gap and be done for Friday."
"5664810","5665730"," Try to vote on that. "
"5665830","5666850"," The question should be in the chat."
"5667410","5668850"," It's going to click yes or no."
"5671790","5673210"," And this is today or Monday. "
"5673350","5674470"," I don't care if it's today or Monday."
"5674510","5677430"," I want to know if we can close that gap today or not or Monday."
"5691670","5694330"," Vote on it or I'm going to insert an ad into this video. "
"5696750","5698850"," I'll put beatings on this video."
"5701190","5702210"," I'm just joking."
"5705370","5708450"," YouTube's always asking me they're like, do you want to insert a video here?"
"5708530","5711110"," It's like a good time to put a video on an ad on them. "
"5711250","5712810"," I'm like, you fucking savages."
"5717590","5718450"," Let's see what you're saying."
"5723890","5726830"," We'll definitely put another one, another block up here in S1. "
"5731650","5733230"," There's fully in charge here."
"5738670","5743710"," I will commence the beatings with advertisements in these videos if you don't answer the question."
"5747110","5747810"," Just a joke. "
"5757590","5762950"," All right, we've got a Davey Duran to subscribe."

"5833670","5834330"," Those two days ago."
"5838670","5839350"," All right."
"5839350","5839990"," So we got here. "
"5841030","5842170"," Let's check the."
"5842910","5844150"," I'm going to click yes."
"5844490","5845090"," I think yes. "
"5845670","5847450"," So I answered the poll."
"5848310","5850530"," We're going to check the poll right now."
"5851150","5853310"," The next 10 seconds 15 seconds. "
"5853310","5858530"," So answer the poll if you think we can close these gaps down below."
"5858530","5860350"," It's only if you're a bully."
"5860450","5864210"," If you're like, Hey, I want to make it if you're a bear and you want to close some short"
"5864210","5866070"," positions or triple leverage call positions. "
"5866690","5869790"," You want to see this gap get closed so you can be like, I'm done."
"5869850","5870230"," I'm out."
"5870950","5874650"," And then if you wanted to take a pretty decent bounce back straight here. "
"5874910","5876250"," You want to see the gap get closed."
"5876370","5877190"," You don't want to see this get."
"5877670","5879910"," You don't want to see this get left open into Monday. "
"5880450","5881430"," None of that shit, right?"
"5881570","5882470"," We said that yesterday."
"5882470","5884270"," We're like we want to see this."
"5884950","5885670"," You can't. "
"5885750","5886570"," You can't take it."
"5886570","5890590"," You can't even confidence kind of like bounce back trade until that gap is closed."
"5891810","5894230"," There's been waiting for this for a month and a half. "
"5895230","5895710"," Totally."
"5896230","5900650"," What do they call that when you get a what is it called when you get teased for like a"
"5900650","5900910"," month."
"5901830","5904690"," Or like tease like cocktased or something like that. "
"5906470","5909950"," Yesterday we saw yesterday we saw that little try to breach yesterday."
"5910910","5914250"," Finally, finally captured the new low hadn't seen that since."
"5914250","5916730"," Or hadn't seen it since the trip up into. "
"5917990","5919810"," Oh, we'll look back right now."
"5921370","5923050"," So you saw yesterday, right?"
"5923330","5924430"," We were looking for this."
"5924730","5925150"," Hold on. "
"5927630","5928590"," See, they're going to."
"5929870","5932270"," We were looking for this breach down here yesterday."
"5932590","5934370"," We finally got it yesterday, right?"
"5935030","5935430"," Talking about. "
"5937270","5938310"," November 10th."
"5939150","5941110"," And yesterday we said we had said."
"5941850","5944490"," You know, if you spend this much time up here. "
"5945730","5947270"," And you can't get it done."
"5948390","5950250"," Then the look is below, right?"
"5950430","5951810"," The computers could come up here."
"5951910","5952690"," They get told no. "
"5953790","5957170"," So you know they're going to come down here until they get told yes."
"5957410","5959230"," So the point would be that."
"5960390","5962770"," Point would be that you had demand here. "
"5962890","5963910"," You had demand here."
"5964270","5967310"," And yesterday the demand disappeared, right?"
"5967910","5970490"," So what they'll do is they'll keep heading lower until they find demand."
"5970490","5977050"," And this doesn't always prove itself up, but you can see that this is where the initial demand was. "
"5977650","5981670"," And they're going to probably go lower to the next level of known demand."
"5982650","5983850"," Until they find it."
"5984850","5988670"," So you really as a bully like as soon as this is given up. "
"5989150","5995470"," You're not looking to buy this market until you known demand is where where known demand is, right?"
"5996410","5997710"," Which is down here."
"5998750","6002090"," So, you know, you have to give it to the bears at that point."
"6002310","6005370"," You're not going to say to yourself, hey, this is the, you know, bulls. "
"6005730","6007290"," You can see right here bears have new low."
"6007570","6012150"," Soon as they got that new low, it's go lower, close the gap, find where real demand is."
"6012310","6013750"," And then it'll start to move back up. "
"6014430","6016470"," And you'll find what the commitment is from the sellers up here."
"6017110","6018810"," Where are the sellers, right?"
"6019290","6020970"," We know they're way up here, right?"
"6021830","6023810"," We know there's more commitment from sellers right here."
"6024590","6026710"," We know there's more commitment from sellers right here. "
"6026710","6031810"," And so if we do turn around at any point, you're going to look for that recommitment from sellers"
"6031810","6033430"," above, which I think they're still there."
"6033810","6035610"," I don't think the sellers have left to be honest with you."
"6036170","6037030"," I think there's here. "
"6037830","6038890"," We know that they're here."
"6038990","6040490"," We can prove that they're here, right?"
"6041190","6042590"," They came in yesterday, hardcore."
"6043670","6046150"," You can see that little little red bar right there. "
"6048090","6051890"," And they're here this morning, of course, you can see them still here this morning."
"6052690","6054210"," And they came away from here."
"6056890","6058290"," Came right in, no problem. "
"6058810","6063270"," Came right in, pushing right down right now to think that they're closing it out right now."
"6063450","6065590"," I can't tell you if they are or if they aren't."
"6068130","6071150"," Yes, still have more buyers than sellers in the market too. "
"6071610","6073870"," You guys see that right on the order flow in the book."
"6074390","6076910"," Still more buyers than sellers right now in the market."
"6081430","6084250"," Or at least it's saying there's more buyers than sellers. "
"6085150","6086950"," We can see that the price is just dropping."
"6092030","6093590"," The old quad witch and baby."
"6094250","6095810"," Dirty dog quad witching. "
"6096730","6099750"," Triple witches, quad witches, call whatever you want."
"6100550","6101690"," They used to be in the same date."
"6101890","6102290"," They're not anymore. "
"6115990","6117190"," Let's close this out and see."
"6117270","6118390"," You got 95 votes now."
"6119050","6123730"," So I'm going to end the poll right now and see what you guys are thinking on. "
"6123950","6125070"," Can we get down there today or not?"
"6127050","6127590"," That's interesting."
"6128210","6129050"," I always love these polls."
"6129270","6130730"," You guys give great answers in these polls. "
"6131630","6136890"," I have to give it to you guys."
"6145910","6146790"," I think we can close it."
"6146790","6147970"," There's some interesting answers. "
"6148150","6151110"," The fact that you don't think that this can get closed today or Monday."
"6152310","6152950"," Speaks volumes."
"6153230","6153910"," You guys are saying no. "
"6154090","6154550"," This is bottom."
"6155070","6159450"," As far as it's going, people are going to wrap it up and take it and move forward here."
"6160010","6162170"," I think we can close it. "
"6162610","6165410"," I think that between now and Monday, this gets closed."
"6166450","6166870"," They're saying no."
"6166870","6171170"," saying no, we're going to go up here and close this gap above or maybe not close the gap, but"
"6171170","6172310"," they're saying we're heading higher now. "
"6173650","6174650"," So interesting."
"6175110","6178890"," Most days you guys are, most days you guys are pretty much same page."
"6179090","6183170"," It's like 65, 85% on one side. "
"6183170","6191430"," And then it breaks down to like, you know, 30, like 15%, 5%, 10%, on the other side of a,"
"6191430","6192430"," on the other side of a trade."
"6192710","6195430"," Today you're 50-50 on this, which is interesting to see."
"6200630","6203310"," Yeah, I'm still sitting, I've still got some zero dates here. "
"6203530","6204150"," I haven't closed them."
"6204410","6206030"," I'm just going to leave them sitting there right to the end of the bell."
"6207410","6208270"," I'm not going to touch them. "
"6208470","6215270"," Just that, this is the, this is the opposite, or not the opposite, but this is the, if you're, if"
"6215270","6217990"," you're trading like a straddle, this is the opposite side of that straddle trade."
"6222130","6224890"," Because I don't trust, I don't trust this market at all on today."
"6225110","6228250"," I think we could go 5% either direction or at any point today. "
"6232970","6238510"," What are you guys saying here?"
"6238930","6239410"," Let's go through here."
"6240610","6242310"," Cap is holding 390s LOL."
"6242830","6248730"," Yeah, I've got a, I've got an SDOW short on the mark, or that's short, triple leveraged calls on"
"6248730","6258610"," the SDOW that are up 150% and then I bought penny calls on the, on the"
"6258610","6258870"," spy. "
"6260250","6261830"," So I don't know, I don't know how you trade."
"6262130","6268930"," I guess maybe you expose yourself at all I'll take the, I'll take the, I'll take the cost of the"
"6268930","6271030"," calls any day of the week as protection."
"6279430","6280850"," Let's see what you guys are talking about here. "
"6286850","6288490"," Hold on, I'm missing what you guys are saying in the chat."
"6291310","6301590"," Uh, well, it will stop at three, 38, 38, 35, just watch blood, he'll explain, let it down day, damn"
"6301590","6303890"," spring, please go see his Twitter account."
"6304670","6307610"," 38, 38, 35 is JPM pin, it's not going below. "
"6308290","6314170"," So rule, rule, not as saying 38, 35 is the JPM pin, it's not going below."
"6315730","6319290"," Uh, did it go below?"
"6319790","6320450"," Yeah, it did."
"6322010","6327030"," So I did go below, 63% of options are bearish ending today. "
"6327030","6329570"," We might see a big rally to crush options going into the close."
"6329890","6335410"," Yeah, I've got a, um, I've got like a two sided trade going on right now."
"6336310","6341830"," I've got the, I have the calls because I don't believe, I'd like to see, I'd like to see this,"
"6341830","6344890"," this close today, but I think you get the rip at some point. "
"6348430","6349450"," I've been a dirty bear."
"6351210","6353890"," Yeah, my, uh, my estau is kind of pinned right now."
"6354090","6360850"," It's not, um, it's same price as it was yesterday within 30 cents, 40 cents. "
"6363110","6365450"," It's my weekly candle just about through 70."
"6365690","6366090"," Are you not?"
"6366330","6367010"," Take a short today."
"6367490","6371150"," Yeah, so you guys, do you guys know what a, do you guys know what estau is?"
"6371530","6373150"," I don't, I don't know if you do or don't. "
"6374630","6376990"," I don't know if you guys know what what I'm doing."
"6379030","6382670"," Uh, daleo, don't shorten now that would be dumb."
"6383370","6388690"," Yeah, my short has been, uh, my short's been on for, uh, two or three weeks now. "
"6390010","6392750"," I've been slowly taking it off as the weeks have passed."
"6394210","6403550"," I have a so it's a, um,"
"6404070","6408130"," it's like for murder, kill, kill, kill market."
"6409350","6410070"," It's for March. "
"6411450","6414810"," Oh god damn, I wonder how big his balls are for Leo."
"6415230","6415510"," Yeah, dude."
"6416210","6418530"," The 500 million dollar trade on Tesla. "
"6419490","6421070"," I want to know what his net worth is."
"6421570","6426170"," I want to know what, I want to know like how much of a billionaire he is and how much"
"6426170","6431530"," he put down on that trade because that's like 30% of his wealth or something like that or 50 "
"6431530","6432230","% of his wealth."
"6432910","6433750"," That's fucking crazy. "
"6435470","6437770"," And you don't know what he's leveraged that money on elsewhere."
"6446070","6448990"," Uh, yeah, he is like, he's one of the largest shareholders of Tesla."
"6449990","6451330"," He's one of the OGs, right?"
"6454170","6457290"," So he bought billions and if Tesla went to zero, he'd still be a billionaire. "
"6457530","6458670"," Or is that what he said, uh, Thomas?"
"6459670","6461170"," I don't know what his net worth is."
"6463930","6469010"," Uh, Thinkorswim has an issue opening orders and really fucking me."
"6469070","6472710"," So I was, yeah, I'm having some walkiness on Thinkorswim myself this morning. "
"6473270","6478430"," I was having a, I was having trouble, uh, on Thinkorswim as well."
"6481510","6484870"," He trading short says up 43% on your stock house."
"6485050","6485390"," Fuck yeah. "
"6486070","6488790"," Garrett saying he's up 30% of his SDAO right on."
"6489530","6490750"," Do you see more blood coming?"
"6492090","6499190"," Uh, the green bottle is leftover from, uh, I had some friends over the other night."
"6499670","6503710"," We finished the night with, uh, for net Baranka. "
"6503710","6511210"," Uh, that was going down 20, 30%."
"6511210","6515850"," Uh, UVX calls are overloaded massive dump and flush coming grab puts."
"6516850","6518530"," 37 55 is the open gap. "
"6518690","6519830"," DJ I still above the MA."
"6520710","6523870"," If so, it's, that's not probably won't go much further, but it may have crossed lower."
"6524570","6524810"," Yeah. "
"6525190","6530850"," The, um, um, there's Blake."
"6532150","6534270"," I'd like to reposition SDAO again."
"6536090","6541330"," Likes like, like get out of the position and then, uh, it's like TLT. "
"6541630","6543090"," So let's look at TLT real quick."
"6544270","6548170"," Hopefully I can get back to you guys have so many good comments and I'm not getting down to the"
"6548170","6548810"," bottom of them."
"6549430","6551590"," So TLT, right?"
"6553630","6555730"," We've talked about TLT over time. "
"6559690","6562710"," We're looking for a re-entry in TLT."
"6564610","6567350"," Well, this was S1, S2, S3 down here somewhere."
"6568410","6570790"," I'd really like to, it moved so slow. "
"6572210","6574190"," I'd really like to see it get down here."
"6574290","6575770"," I want to see that S1 down here."
"6576090","6579430"," At least, I'd really like to buy the 200. "
"6580150","6584330"," This is the, this is the, it could go lower."
"6584670","6585750"," These things move so slow."
"6587470","6595310"," On a daily, you can see up here, let me see if I can close all this out here. "
"6596410","6598370"," Let me clear all this whole chart for you guys."
"6604090","6606910"," So my, I want to, there's a couple things we're trying to do here."
"6607230","6611330"," So, delete all. "
"6612290","6626490"," Okay, so, like, I can see the want to buy, I'm"
"6626490","6627630"," gonna write."
"6628010","6629210"," There's like a trade in here, right?"
"6629710","6640790"," But, as far as trend goes, yeah,"
"6640950","6641870"," I mean, I can see it."
"6642050","6646370"," I can see people are saying this to people are saying to get back in right now. "
"6646450","6648710"," And I'm like, man, I want that cheap fucking buy."
"6649630","6651610"," We got down at 106 down here."
"6652170","6652690"," I want that. "
"6652890","6653470"," I always like these."
"6653990","6655410"," I want to buy the shit cheap."
"6658750","6659710"," So, I don't know. "
"6660630","6662550"," I'm getting a bid in TLT right now."
"6664130","6672670"," I just, when I see stuff like this down here, I always feel like there's a trap and shit like"
"6672670","6680790"," this, like, it always looks really good."
"6680950","6689270"," And then like a week later, you come back and it, it dumps, like these people down here are"
"6689270","6696510"," probably looking for, for people to buy, they sell into strength, right?"
"6696790","6701210"," So you've got strength coming up, strength, strength, strength, they tell you, yeah, hey, man,"
"6701210","6702570"," look, we're at the 200 or whatever. "
"6703010","6705550"," For above the 200, just buy this shit, we're going up higher."
"6705830","6709610"," And then, then it rolls over like it has this liquidity graph down below."
"6711270","6713190"," And these guys come back and invite again. "
"6713190","6714370"," And then you're stuck."
"6714910","6716450"," So they trade it back up again."
"6720570","6722870"," So, I'm like halfway, I'd like to buy it. "
"6726950","6731050"," Like 102, somewhere right here."
"6732430","6733610"," That's where I want to buy it."
"6738290","6742990"," Even though the daily chart's saying something different, that's where I want to buy it. "
"6753690","6758310"," I've gotten stuck in a TLT trade in the past two where I didn't buy it the right place."
"6758790","6760030"," It moves slow, man."
"6761490","6763550"," And you know that there are sellers up here. "
"6766110","6775210"," Right here, we had some broke through those."
"6775530","6776830"," It's got strength, I'll give it that."
"6778970","6780810"," It definitely has some strength here. "
"6783470","6784830"," It can't be denied."
"6784870","6785870"," It can't be denied."
"6786250","6787630"," The TLT has some strength here. "
"6793590","6795430"," It cannot be denied."
"6799270","6805830"," Hey, I want, I want this like pixelation moved."
"6806010","6806730"," I want this consolidation. "
"6807950","6810390"," I want this so bad down here."
"6811250","6811930"," Fuck the moving averages."
"6813310","6814170"," That's what I want. "
"6814410","6815150"," Something like that."
"6818610","6819830"," I'm not buying it."
"6823310","6825190"," And that's kind of the same thing with Esto. "
"6826210","6827310"," I want to like slap that top."
"6829330","6830990"," I want to buy this down here."
"6845150","6847190"," I like the straight up puck moving out. "
"6847290","6848670"," Sometimes it's like fucking moving averages."
"6855870","6857650"," I pushed it up right here."
"6857990","6858850"," Pushed it up right here. "
"6859970","6862690"," And then they pushed it up right here and right here."
"6869090","6871070"," We'll be patient on this trade."
"6871890","6874630"," If you guys take this trade, I know people are calling for it. "
"6876570","6879510"," I like that because these moves are so long, man."
"6879810","6883250"," When they go on trend mode, it's like it's like a month."
"6884210","6885310"," They start rolling over. "
"6885470","6886650"," It could take like two, three weeks."
"6891690","6895410"," The full rejection is still on the spy trying to get lower."
"6899710","6900530"," Let's see here. "
"6904410","6905770"," You can see it right here."
"6906550","6907310"," Same thing as before."
"6907510","6910030"," I broke that or rejected right off. "
"6910910","6911210"," Took out."
"6911970","6912490"," Hold on a second here."
"6920310","6921470"," Let's see right here, right?"
"6921650","6924390"," We had this this demand line below, right?"
"6924790","6925630"," Came right off R1. "
"6926550","6928130"," We jacked it off R2."
"6929290","6932010"," We have a breakthrough, right?"
"6932670","6933210"," Came back up."
"6933970","6935670"," Know that the sellers are hiding up here. "
"6936490","6941450"," Now they're taking it down, trying to break a break below or not break below, but get down here to"
"6941450","6941890"," S3."
"6943650","6945630"," More than likely heading down here, S3."
"6947650","6949130"," It's almost time percent sure. "
"6949370","6952990"," Head down to S3 and then down to close the gap down below and via a close."
"6953850","6958710"," When I was on team close the gap, today or Monday, 100% close the gap."
"6960290","6962310"," From on team close the gap, first sure. "
"6965350","6966350"," Nope, hold on there."
"6968370","6969070"," Right there."
"6972810","6973530"," Let's see here. "
"6979350","6980670"," Produced inside the week, the candle."
"6981110","6981510"," See what else it goes."
"6981710","6982970"," Need another 3.5% down. "
"6983270","6984890"," Likely could close the gap next week."
"6985930","6986330"," It's a love story."
"6986610","6987650"," Cap wants us to click less. "
"6987830","6988250"," Yes or no?"
"6990110","6991310"," Maybe next Wednesday, Cap."
"6991750","6993010"," There are lots of ads beginning."
"6993190","6993430"," I noticed. "
"6993610","6994370"," Are they paying you now?"
"6996150","6997590"," They don't really pay there."
"6997590","6998890"," It's a really good thing."
"6999070","7006110"," So I signed up for the ads, but you could place them. "
"7006830","7011270"," Like they asked me to place them throughout the videos and I only placed one at the beginning."
"7011310","7011870"," That was it."
"7012510","7015750"," So when you get into the livestream, you don't see them ever through the livestream at all. "
"7017490","7021070"," But the pay, it's like two cents or one cents a video or something like that."
"7021650","7022350"," But you don't get paid."
"7022590","7023070"," It's like pennies. "
"7024250","7027010"," I think yesterday's video, I think I got eight cents."
"7027910","7029210"," Literally eight pennies."
"7032330","7034630"," Don't see it closing today, Monday again. "
"7035510","7036430"," Well, of course it can."
"7036590","7037750"," It could do anything we do."
"7038110","7038950"," Do we think it will?"
"7039230","7039850"," Is that the question?"
"7040090","7041290"," I'm getting condensed milk ads. "
"7041870","7044230"," Are you guys getting ads right now during the stream?"
"7046050","7046970"," You shouldn't be."
"7049350","7050390"," Close that gap."
"7051110","7054730"," Did you get an ad at the beginning of the stream or anytime during the stream so far have you"
"7054730","7055270"," gotten any ads?"
"7055650","7057250"," Because I'll turn them off right now if they're on. "
"7058230","7059190"," Let me check right now."
"7059270","7059630"," Hold on a second."
"7060430","7061070"," Oh shit. "
"7061170","7062690"," I just inserted an ad with the fuck."
"7063330","7064070"," Hold on a second."
"7068050","7069330"," Hold on one second here. "
"7075530","7076250"," All right."
"7076390","7077170"," So I turned ads off."
"7077850","7079610"," If you guys are watching an ad, I just turned them off. "
"7080390","7085350"," I thought I was turning them off, but I think I had slammed an ad or something."
"7089750","7090450"," No cancel."
"7090730","7090970"," Save. "
"7091990","7092830"," I just turned them off."
"7092970","7094570"," I don't know what I'm doing here."
"7095670","7097390"," I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing here. "
"7100610","7103490"," I turned them off so they shouldn't be on."
"7103490","7107370"," Oh, let me see."
"7107550","7109030"," Just notice the thumbnail very nice. "
"7109350","7110930"," Just missing Elon taking his flamethrower."
"7111070","7111830"," Test the bullports."
"7112410","7112810"," LOL. "
"7113390","7113570"," Captain."
"7113950","7114250"," Uh-huh."
"7114530","7115170"," What's the cap?"
"7115350","7116130"," Hey, Jay Starp. "
"7116210","7116610"," Sorry, your brother."
"7117270","7118910"," I think Tesla's about able to bounce here."
"7119090","7121170"," How is there 220 for watching with two likes?"
"7121770","7122230"," Thanks, James. "
"7122450","7123070"," I appreciate that."
"7125510","7127170"," Top of the thumbnails who designs them."
"7127850","7128570"," I try to do them. "
"7128730","7129890"," I try to write them really nice."
"7130530","7133410"," I try to do them myself on the fly in the morning."
"7133670","7134570"," This morning, I couldn't. "
"7135030","7139870"," This morning, I didn't do the Photoshop and make it look perfect because I didn't have time."
"7140190","7142150"," I was like, I've got five minutes to make a thumbnail."
"7143370","7145030"," You're getting a five minute thumbnail. "
"7147730","7148550"," Let me see here."
"7149450","7151450"," On the bear, the wife told you not to worry about."
"7154530","7155950"," Oh, it's Hermes. "
"7156710","7157510"," Thanks, Hermes."
"7157830","7158390"," I appreciate it, brother."
"7162590","7164710"," That, yes, the SR flip was beautiful. "
"7165150","7166790"," Edging pears with blue balls to November."
"7169790","7170770"," Good morning, Hermes."
"7170970","7171350"," How are you, brother?"
"7172010","7173090"," Is the rug pull on retail?"
"7173390","7175130"," I believe big money guys hide their trades. "
"7175850","7179690"," All retail traders buy calls, bounce them, boom, all of a sudden, hidden bloody shirts come in"
"7179690","7179910"," hand."
"7180810","7181530"," What else you got up here?"
"7183130","7185170"," That's not, that's not, uh, hold on a second."
"7185290","7185750"," What are you guys are saying?"
"7185930","7187350"," I'm missing a bunch of you guys are saying here. "
"7188850","7190330"," Uh, Tesla calls the guests."
"7190590","7193530"," The money more likely would, witches be crazy closing gap."
"7194470","7197270"," Less than three makes bears, so Jolly Captain, I'm in spy calls. "
"7197330","7198750"," Your title says 1214."
"7199510","7200310"," Oh, does it really?"
"7200610","7201630"," Thanks for saying something about that."
"7202350","7203390"," Uh, Andreas. "
"7203930","7205850"," I don't know if I can adjust that right now."
"7206030","7208530"," Let me see if he can change the, uh, title."
"7210890","7212090"," Thanks for the heads up on that. "
"7214970","7216730"," Yeah, I was like trying to get here today."
"7216730","7220370"," Flying and I just, I was like slam live stream."
"7220370","7220830"," Get it going. "
"7221550","7223250"," Thanks for, thanks for the heads up on that."
"7227850","7230730"," Uh, Euroclothes and Hermes sand, the Euroclothes in 30 minutes."
"7230770","7234810"," If we do, if we do go to 378, I'll probably buy some 380s. "
"7235210","7237190"," Uh, might set up, nope."
"7237610","7238190"," That's down, no."
"7238670","7240230"," Three times down, three times short. "
"7240670","7241350"," It's not really a short."
"7241530","7245010"," It's, uh, you buy calls on a triple leverage ETF."
"7245710","7253050"," A inverse ETF and you take them like three months out, four months out and they tend to, if it"
"7253050","7258950"," starts to move in your direction, it's, it's where resistant to the swings of, let's say, like a UV"
"7258950","7261210"," XY, uh, close dated. "
"7262470","7263890"," It's for a market crash scenario."
"7266970","7273830"," It's not, it's, it's a, so if you're looking at all the indexes, which ones the, yeah, if you, if"
"7273830","7279810"," you compare every index, if you're looking at the rut, if you're looking at, uh, the DGIA, if"
"7279810","7285490"," you're looking at SPX complex, if there's one place, if we get a crash, what would, what would get"
"7285490","7286150"," the hit the biggest?"
"7287170","7288450"," More than likely to dial in my view."
"7290610","7292430"," So I think that's why the money was hiding. "
"7296810","7299210"," Yeah, it's a triple leverage, uh, inverse ETF short."
"7299630","7302730"," Not a short, it's a long call, inverse ETF."
"7305010","7307410"," But I don't want, I don't want to say that like 20 times. "
"7310970","7313330"," MK knows what it is, uh, morning, y'all."
"7315930","7323750"," Co-co-co-audio, third largest, uh, what would you recommend to inverse SPX, S&P 500?"
"7324810","7327230"," Um, that's a tough one."
"7327850","7333170"," Normally just puts, uh, so if I wanted to put expo, not not puts, I fucking hate puts on spy. "
"7333890","7339450"," I'll be honest, like the reason I like spy puts is because they pay one to one, they're not built"
"7339450","7340130"," really to pay."
"7341370","7347730"," They'll pay in giant moves, but, uh, the pay in giant moves, but the time, having to time them is"
"7347730","7348070"," brutal."
"7349430","7354490"," I tend to buy on spy, I tend to buy calls as a hedge, like zero dates or I'll buy,"
"7355130","7358650"," uh, zero date calls, uh, for a ripper, anything like that. "
"7358650","7364830"," Uh, if I, if I'm going to short the market, I tend to use different products."
"7366030","7371890"," I won't use spy puts rarely, sometimes, but rarely, uh, do I, do I take a spy put?"
"7372310","7373150"," I don't like how they pay."
"7375650","7378950"," You know, typically I'll get torched in that position, so I don't bother. "
"7381910","7383830"," I like spy, uh, put spreads."
"7385170","7387870"," I love those with time on them, I like them."
"7392470","7397330"," So, uh, an answer to some options, zvx, our calls, time to load puts, plus coming multi-vx. "
"7397490","7401510"," Just make everyone aware of fed advice, Jeff, a supervision bar, currently speaking at the FSOC"
"7401510","7402070"," meeting."
"7402670","7404270"," They're currently speaking about banks at the moment."
"7404710","7409230"," You got fucked in a cop on, uh, an order today on, uh, think or swim. "
"7409730","7411570"," Looks like a big band of buyers just stepped in and spy."
"7411870","7413670"," Google says net worth is 4.6 billion."
"7413890","7415370"," So that's a pretty big, okay. "
"7415710","7418390"," So preposter say there's Google net worth is 4.6 billion."
"7418390","7419810"," So that's a big fucking trade."
"7420310","7426670"," Like, there's no reason for, uh, 4.6 billion air to be buying 500 million dollars worth of Tesla"
"7426670","7427130"," stock. "
"7428750","7429810"," That's very irrational."
"7433770","7437090"," Cancel, cancel them when they fill the narrow later for $2 current price."
"7437410","7440930"," You have had that, I've had, I've had issues with think or swim in the past, or not think or"
"7440930","7443710"," swim with, uh, tasty, but they've rectified it every time. "
"7444310","7445270"," That's why you get a good broker."
"7446070","7449970"," It's because the, I've had, I've had refunds for $20,000 from tasty."
"7451730","7456990"," Uh, why don't you leg this down into a spread?"
"7457930","7462970"," Uh, the reason, uh, the blood pent is asking the question of, why don't I put it into a spread?"
"7463730","7472710"," When I entered the trade, I entered on the bottom, and I was looking at my price target, and I"
"7472710","7473810"," was looking at my price target. "
"7473810","7480630"," I was looking at interest in it, and then I was looking at, um, so like you plan the entire"
"7480630","7481390"," trade out, right?"
"7482590","7487790"," And I was looking, would I, if we had wild swings in the market, would I lose value of my,"
"7488190","7490930"," the value of my, uh, my single hold?"
"7492170","7493310"," And I wouldn't."
"7493590","7499650"," I posted on Twitter, make sure, take a week or two ago, I said, make sure that your hedge can"
"7499650","7502190"," withstand a trip to 430."
"7502190","7508390"," And that was implying that if you're going to put a hedge in the market, that you wouldn't lose"
"7508390","7509310"," value in it. "
"7511330","7514930"," Uh, even if we crash or have a bloodbath at some point."
"7515750","7521530"," And that product that I chose does not move a hell, hell of a lot with the market going up."
"7522710","7524390"," Uh, for my target price, right?"
"7524690","7527530"," I'm, I'm looking forward to hit on the high end 40. "
"7529790","7535270"," Um, so I don't want to have too many concerns here with it going to zero."
"7536470","7537630"," The way it's structured."
"7538410","7539170"," It's a hedge. "
"7543050","7548150"," So just to make everyone aware, the US Treasury Secretary Yellen fed the vice chair for supervision"
"7548150","7553930"," bars, well, let's face Chairman Powell currently speaking at the FSOC on climate at the moment."
"7554370","7557170"," As opposed to the live video for this out on the feed for those interested."
"7558010","7559690"," I'm not, I'm not dealing with data on it. "
"7559770","7561790"," Yeah, so far, no mention of monetary policy."
"7561790","7563630"," It does seem to be just be talking about climate."
"7566110","7571370"," So you go, TLT going to 103, Travis thinks 103 and on, uh, TLT. "
"7571530","7572730"," Yeah, I'd like to take it down there, man."
"7574670","7577150"," TLT is that one of those fucking things like bonds, man."
"7577290","7579510"," It's like, you're in that trade forever. "
"7580430","7581670"," DIA is the same way."
"7581870","7584290"," DIA is like, doggone's industrial average."
"7584930","7587270"," You get yourself in a trade and it's like, it takes a month. "
"7587270","7589830"," It always takes a fucking month."
"7592550","7595230"," Fed stop buying, TLT goes down."
"7595730","7598610"," Spy just selling off by bullish TLT. "
"7598750","7601850"," Can you explain how you frame it?"
"7602130","7602430"," Yeah, sure."
"7604230","7609210"," So I'm bullish on TLT because, uh, here."
"7610050","7616490"," I'm bullish on TLT because of the Fed's positioning on rates. "
"7618070","7619290"," Into next year."
"7620430","7621770"," That's a great question, by the way."
"7621830","7622470"," I'll answer that right now. "
"7623190","7628710"," Uh, my, my, the reason I want to, so I want to, so if I have a, if I position"
"7628710","7630470"," myself for 2023, right?"
"7631470","7637730"," My expectation, what I'm expecting is that the Fed is attempting to trade the market sideways as"
"7637730","7640250"," long as possible until the market can crash."
"7641570","7648310"," Uh, and have, finally have, uh, not, not crash so much, but I got a capitulation moment."
"7648490","7649010"," We'll call it that. "
"7650550","7653230"," And for us to find a bottom in the market."
"7653890","7658730"," And that's, from my understanding of a soft landing or a hard landing, I don't care which one, um,"
"7659190","7664650"," they're trying to, uh, trade the markets, sideways and down until they get three things."
"7665590","7675050"," They're trying to get, uh, rates up to roll inflation down and bring unemployment up. "
"7677230","7678970"," Everything else is secondary."
"7680370","7685790"," So when you bring up the unemployment rate, you then get demand destruction and housing."
"7686450","7688650"," You then get demand destruction and used cars. "
"7689650","7692310"," Uh, you then get people not being able to pay their credit cards off."
"7692690","7697630"," So if you're going to try to get rid of bad debt out there, unemployment solves that problem."
"7698810","7702230"," Until you have high unemployment, you don't solve those issues. "
"7702970","7711070"," In the history of the United States stock market, you never find a bottom until you have high"
"7711070","7715610"," unemployment rate, inflation going low down towards like that 2% mark."
"7716930","7719370"," The Fed is a hammer on a nail."
"7719670","7724750"," They don't care about you looking at CPI, PPI or adjusting over the years. "
"7724830","7725570"," They just don't care."
"7726370","7727150"," Um, they use one metric."
"7727690","7730530"," They're looking for certain numbers that they're not seeing them. "
"7730530","7739110"," Um, so, um, the, the, it implies that for, especially this last Fed meeting is implying that"
"7739650","7744190"," they're going to quote unquote, I don't believe them, but quote unquote, maintain course."
"7744590","7745950"," I think they're going to raise rates even higher."
"7746350","7750250"," I thought they would have announced that on this Fed meeting, that they would have announced 75"
"7750250","7750870"," VPS. "
"7751570","7753810"," Uh, but they said they're maintaining course."
"7754170","7759110"," It's the same intent of trading it sideways and down and looking so that you'll see an attempt made"
"7759110","7760750"," probably in January or March."
"7761850","7766610"," Uh, and then you'll see another attempt made in November of December of next year to finally find a"
"7766610","7766850"," bottom. "
"7767590","7772890"," With that said, you need to see unemployment rise for that, for that action to take place"
"7772890","7774330"," significantly."
"7776430","7779870"," Um, I don't know if you can track and all this or not."
"7780070","7783030"," The key is this, the money needs to be deployed somewhere. "
"7783950","7790770"," If you start to see, which we are seeing, a twig, any kind of risky bonds going down in TLT"
"7790770","7799170"," coming up, it's saying that, um, high quality bonds, ultra high quality bonds are still placed to"
"7799170","7799690"," keep your money."
"7800050","7804210"," So you'll see pension funds, uh, attempt to hide their money in different places."
"7804210","7806090"," You saw them hide it in REITs. "
"7806730","7809450"," Uh, they started that, I want to say a year or two ago."
"7809650","7813270"," They went into the Dow Jones industrial average, right?"
"7813650","7815270"," So you saw the Dow Jones rise up."
"7815270","7819130"," That is pension money, uh, trying to make money in the background. "
"7819250","7823930"," And so you want to track where they're putting their money, uh, so that they can invest it"
"7823930","7824250"," somewhere."
"7824850","7829090"," Uh, so the implication was that they went into REITs, they then moved into the Dow Jones industrial"
"7829090","7832270"," average, and now they're going into the bond, into the bond market."
"7832530","7835150"," If they're going to go into the bond market, they're going to go into the best bonds they can find. "
"7836190","7843270"," Uh, so the idea would be that you would, or me at least, I would pull a cash into, uh,"
"7843690","7845150"," shorting the Dow Jones industrial average."
"7845270","7845510"," Right?"
"7845810","7846490"," Because they're leaving."
"7847750","7850650"," This is my posit, but they're leaving the Dow Jones industrial average. "
"7850670","7857810"," When I long the, um, uh, kick ass bonds, right?"
"7857950","7859410"," The highest quality, highest quality bonds."
"7860050","7865410"," I wanted to put a little bit of cash in some risky blue chip growth, a little bit summoned to"
"7865410","7870490"," the S&P 500, uh, for an up and down, moving slowly down into the end of the year, but"
"7870490","7871930"," still trade, trade that stuff."
"7872350","7877610"," That's putting some actual risk in the market, but a very small percentage, 20% or so, right?"
"7878090","7887410"," Like 60% TLT, 20% trying to short the Dow down, and maybe, maybe slamming wherever I can, and"
"7887410","7894490"," then some risk in the S&P 500, some tech, that's been, especially tech that's been shorted down for"
"7894490","7900470"," the past year, uh, and then probably trying to seek out where the banks are and whatever tech"
"7900470","7902050"," they're, they're putting their risk into. "
"7902050","7904470"," So that's my posit on this year."
"7905210","7909890"," And then I'm looking for an event at some point, but I'm not looking for that event."
"7909890","7913990"," I'm not looking for that crash until unemployment comes up. "
"7914450","7915310"," I want to see unemployment."
"7916130","7917350"," I want to see blood in the streets."
"7918270","7919570"," I want to see the Fed rates high. "
"7920990","7925770"," I want to see inflation coming down, which it already is, but they're not getting the unemployment"
"7925770","7926150"," up."
"7927010","7933130"," So until that happens, you and my, I'm positing that you won't see a bottom to this market."
"7934550","7940370"," Now, this last Fed meeting, this last Fed meeting where I was thinking, there's another way,"
"7940370","7947330"," there's another way for the market to go up, and that would be where the Fed has taken seriously by"
"7947330","7954250"," the stock market that they're fighting inflation and trying to increase unemployment, believe it or"
"7954250","7954430"," not. "
"7954890","7959330"," If the market believes that, you would actually see the market instead of trading sideways and"
"7959330","7961210"," down, you'd see it trade up."
"7962230","7968310"," And then we would still get a crash once unemployment peaked, and the crash wouldn't be as deep."
"7969190","7976050"," So right now, though, the plan from their side is not just, well, the market doesn't believe that. "
"7976050","7980010"," His Treasury Secretary, Janent, is facing a serious economic headwinds."
"7980450","7984310"," And Janent discusses the 2022 annual FSOC reports at a meeting."
"7985110","7987450"," In the video for this is on the feed for those interested. "
"7987450","7989750"," So right now, the market doesn't believe them."
"7989830","7990690"," They think they're going to pivot."
"7992570","7997070"," If they had come out and given 475 VPS, the market would have likely gone up in my viewpoint. "
"7998170","8002190"," And not just viewpoint, but historically, we can go up with high rates."
"8002570","8006710"," We can go up if the market believes that the Fed is serious."
"8008410","8009730"," But the market doesn't believe the Fed. "
"8010190","8012550"," So the Fed should be aware of that."
"8012790","8016930"," Now, I don't know if they are or they aren't, but it's showing in the stock market."
"8016930","8024650"," So what you'll end up seeing is a continuation of sideways and down until unemployment gets high. "
"8026390","8028170"," The inflation is not really an issue."
"8028350","8029190"," Everybody's talking about inflation."
"8029410","8030650"," I'm like, get that out of your head. "
"8030730","8031450"," Inflation is coming down."
"8031970","8033450"," I don't care about the dissecting of it."
"8033830","8039870"," That's just like, if you have the cake that's like icing on the cake to try to make a point,"
"8039970","8040530"," it means nothing. "
"8041610","8045050"," Truly right now, it really is the problem, is that we have everybody working."
"8046130","8048550"," And we need mass layoffs, so be honest with you."
"8048610","8048990"," That's the truth. "
"8049350","8054270"," And you don't want to say that because it's not good press or PR for the Fed."
"8054810","8058530"," You know, if the Fed comes out and says, we want to screw over all the poor people in all"
"8058530","8062990"," the middle class and take away all your, you know, we want you to lose your house and we want"
"8062990","8063630"," you to lose your car."
"8064230","8065170"," They can't say that. "
"8066150","8068530"," They'll be, you know, they'll be wanting to chop people's heads off."
"8069090","8075570"," So they lie to you and, you know, most people don't take any kind of an economics education in"
"8075570","8075810"," school."
"8078330","8084690"," You know, it's just, it's a way, it's a way, the way to try to save face while knowing what"
"8084690","8090350"," they have to do down the road to, they say it, but they don't say it. "
"8090490","8095510"," Like, y'all on the other day was basically lying to the American people that don't understand that"
"8095510","8097830"," this is what needs to happen because of how our system is set up."
"8100110","8105330"," So, if the market doesn't believe that they're taking it seriously right now, we'll trade it"
"8105330","8105990"," sideways and down."
"8107350","8112670"," And if you're a bull looking to buy an actual bottom, like, hey, I'm going to go full, you want"
"8112670","8118530"," the next bull run, like real bull run, not, if the market believes we'll trade, like we'll grind up"
"8118530","8123530"," for during this time period, we would end up grinding up for a whole year or two as unemployment"
"8123530","8124170"," rose. "
"8125630","8126650"," Then we'd have a capitulation moment."
"8127130","8134070"," Now, if we, if we don't, and the market doesn't believe that, then we're going to go sideways and"
"8134070","8141170"," down, you'll see people, people flee to TLT to bonds, and you'll see not, not, not, not high"
"8141170","8142670"," response, but quality bonds."
"8143270","8144570"," Well, let's consider quality bonds. "
"8146230","8153690"," So, if you see unemployment rise at some point, you'd exit your lungs on TLT, now you'd be full on"
"8153690","8155970"," cash, and you'd be looking for that crash."
"8158890","8161470"," So, does that put it together enough for you?"
"8163110","8163590"," Hopefully."
"8167230","8170430"," I had funds on all the glass cell calls. "
"8172090","8175330"," 6.50, 30 hours morning, good morning, Abraham, good morning."
"8175430","8175670"," How are you?"
"8177010","8178430"," That's from 130 and then maybe 90."
"8179350","8181790"," Yeah, we've been calling that week for fucking months now, right?"
"8182630","8184130"," 130 and 96 or so. "
"8184130","8191049"," So, after the Elon Musk hit the past few weeks, man, I called Joe Donut, and I was like, I'm"
"8191049","8192129"," losing faith in Elon."
"8192510","8194410"," I'm like, I'm fucking losing faith in Elon."
"8195129","8198670"," I was like, I'm like, I'm seeing the 40s now in the 20s. "
"8198790","8200270"," I'm serious, like in the background."
"8202049","8203850"," And I agree with that guy, Leo."
"8204270","8204950"," I have faith in Tesla. "
"8205969","8207530"," I'm not having faith in Elon right now."
"8208230","8209030"," I have to be honest."
"8212549","8221250"," No, I am losing faith in Elon Musk, and I think some of it's weird too, because yesterday, like the"
"8221250","8223570"," doxing stuff, I'm like, yeah, I agree with all that, but it doesn't matter. "
"8224430","8225990"," This isn't how CEO acts."
"8226549","8227330"," I don't give a fine fuck."
"8228530","8236250"," Like the sloppiness and then the aggressiveness on Twitter, like all that nonsense, turning people"
"8236250","8243969"," on each other on Twitter is fucked up too, and then someone said Twitter's become the world star,"
"8245870","8248150"," world star for white people or something. "
"8248830","8249570"," I thought that was hilarious."
"8251830","8253150"," It's becoming a disaster."
"8254110","8255270"," It's just not a good look. "
"8256270","8258209"," Twitter doesn't have a fan base right now, either."
"8258990","8267469"," It's like a unified fan base, no matter what your political background is, there's no like, I don't"
"8267469","8274510"," understand it, because you can do that stuff in the background, I guess, but to publicly air it out"
"8274510","8275850"," the streets, it's just kind of wild."
"8276389","8277090"," It reminds me of Rome. "
"8277450","8279770"," It's like really bad, really bad."
"8285790","8286990"," No ads during stream."
"8287570","8289469"," Yeah, I turned them off, so there should be no ads. "
"8290610","8292549"," Sometimes you do get ads only."
"8292730","8297070"," So I thought I had them at the beginning of the stream only and not during the stream."
"8298370","8302910"," Then I just slammed the insert ad hair button, so then I turned it off. "
"8309010","8310389"," First time doing a stream just now."
"8310530","8311049"," That was my bad."
"8311170","8311610"," I just did that. "
"8311709","8312549"," I hit the button by accident."
"8320730","8323610"," I know it's I don't know what the fuck I'm doing back here."
"8323910","8327570"," This is like I have like a I've got like a monitor that I have to work on for streamlabs"
"8327570","8331350"," and I got a monitor over here with like YouTube's like, oh no, you got to do all sort of"
"8331350","8332010"," shit over here too. "
"8332150","8332709"," Sorry, buddy."
"8333110","8334570"," You need another monitor for that shit."
"8334650","8335250"," I'm like, okay. "
"8335490","8336209"," All right, whatever."
"8341590","8342650"," Stick to crayotting."
"8347770","8348910"," Pull out all of it. "
"8351389","8352370"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"8352410","8356590"," It's going to be so in traditional finance ties or a risk."
"8359760","8360480"," Pull out here. "
"8360660","8361900"," Let's see if you guys are talking over here."
"8365219","8369120"," So everybody on the internet saying 3835, you've been answered constant any constant."
"8370360","8371680"," You're kind of pinned here right now. "
"8371680","8371980"," You haven't did."
"8371980","8373160"," Also, I had the digital assets."
"8373240","8376379"," Sorry, focused of the FSOC this year. "
"8381990","8382990"," Like the stream, everyone."
"8383230","8383290"," Thanks."
"8383510","8386170"," Yeah, please like and subscribe on the stream. "
"8386790","8388750"," Please like the video, at least, and a bare minimum."
"8389310","8390150"," I appreciate that."
"8391670","8393250"," Right on, futures trader 87. "
"8393470","8394290"," Good to see you back, man."
"8394550","8395150"," You're on your boat, brother."
"8396450","8398110"," Did you have a good sale or what?"
"8400490","8402250"," Do I think we fill the gap on futures?"
"8402830","8404090"," Yeah, I saw the gap above. "
"8405130","8406150"," It's dangerous, man."
"8406410","8408490"," Like today's a dangerous day on both sides."
"8409350","8412570"," I think we can easily blast up into the bell today easily. "
"8415070","8416430"," Calls on S-star are straight out."
"8416770","8418790"," Yeah, I just buy, so what you do is this."
"8419170","8421370"," This is not placed by S-star promise of that. "
"8422050","8423870"," There's a better place to buy it."
"8424110","8426130"," I would wait."
"8427290","8431110"," But what I would do is I'm not going to recommend that you ever make a trade. "
"8431110","8433330"," I can't tell you how to take a trade."
"8434090","8435870"," I don't want to ever tell you how to take a trade."
"8436630","8437590"," I just say what I do. "
"8439570","8442350"," What I would do is I would go to an options profit calculator."
"8443310","8445590"," And I would look at different strikes and different dates."
"8447070","8449670"," And you know, if you don't know how to play, I want you guys to start. "
"8449890","8457090"," Some of you guys know this, but you should be, every trade you get into, you should be thinking"
"8457090","8462610"," about why you're getting into it, what you want it to be, and what is it for."
"8464110","8471110"," And especially, you can, you can, on options profit calculator or thinker swim or tasty works, you"
"8471110","8478830"," can actually decide if you're going to do just a naked call, or naked puts, or if you're just going"
"8478830","8484390"," to long calls, or if you're just going to do spreads or whatever you're going to do and find out"
"8484390","8487330"," what the best risk strategy is for you."
"8488010","8496750"," Now, that specific ticker, when I purchased the calls, for my price target, I was more concerned"
"8496750","8503510"," about my biggest concern when I took that trade was because I was like, well, I'm targeting 40,"
"8504210","8504210"," right?"
"8505310","8511130"," And if I buy these now, when do I start to, if we start in that direction in the next"
"8511130","8513910"," month or so, do I start to get any kind of theta burn?"
"8514090","8514790"," That was my biggest prepare. "
"8514790","8522610"," It was, well, I get any theta burn if we, it just sits here for a month and it didn't."
"8522830","8524350"," It wasn't showing that I would."
"8524670","8532490"," I've got some volatile or implied ball concerns in that trade that I thought would come off into"
"8532490","8533970"," Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"8534690","8539510"," So I took part of the trade off and the ball is still here, right, an SPX of spies."
"8539990","8542130"," So I'm not as concerned right now."
"8551670","8553210"," I'm not as concerned about that though. "
"8553530","8553830"," I'm not as concerned about that though."
"8553830","8558630"," If the implied volatility comes off that trade, that'll be reprised."
"8559470","8564210"," But you should be looking at, is it stable while you're holding it or not?"
"8565010","8567570"," It's not a highly liquid trade either. "
"8567990","8574770"," So, there's a little bit more stability in that trade."
"8574790","8578950"," Then if you're on spy, you know, if you're in spy, it's like up, down, up, down."
"8579050","8580290"," There's a little more stability in SPX. "
"8581030","8582870"," There isn't spy, we know that too in pricing."
"8583850","8587850"," Spies of like up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, constantly."
"8589090","8590510"," People pile in, people pile out. "
"8594730","8596630"," I like SPX to use to trade that."
"8596910","8597710"," I've traded that in the past."
"8598790","8599930"," I traded SPX to you. "
"8600330","8606210"," I want to say in the 2020 crash, that I don't like trading the Dow anymore."
"8606490","8607790"," I fucking stay away from DIA."
"8609130","8609910"," I've done that. "
"8610090","8610770"," I hate those trades."
"8611670","8612990"," I like Esto."
"8615410","8618650"," I have March 14th or 17th, 25 C's. "
"8623690","8628650"," Yeah, there was, I had, I was, I was trying to place the trade earlier."
"8629670","8635750"," My options chain was going crazy on, I don't think I swam on Tasty."
"8636430","8638430"," There were order flow options this morning for sure. "
"8646930","8650550"," Yeah, so shorting MES, I wouldn't have done that today."
"8652350","8662310"," I don't, I would, so that my, or my view today, I thought it was highly dangerous to take"
"8662310","8665690"," contracts on short or long today."
"8667210","8670130"," I think either side you could get trap, trap, big time. "
"8671410","8672830"," I thought the risk was too high."
"8673190","8674990"," Jay, Jay Marcus was talking about this yesterday."
"8675790","8681610"," He was saying that one or, one or two was biggest losses and his career was on quad witching or"
"8681610","8690270"," triple witching and the market had moved five or six percent that day and, you know, if you're on"
"8690270","8693390"," the wrong side of that trade in contracts, you're getting a fucking phone call. "
"8694370","8696150"," Without a doubt, you're getting a fucking phone call."
"8696310","8700190"," And if it doesn't come back, you're, you're in big trouble."
"8701570","8706730"," So I kind of like just calls and puts today. "
"8707890","8714970"," I like the, I don't think any like analysis is going to prove true today."
"8714970","8719570"," I don't think that technical TA matters today."
"8719770","8721670"," I don't think that you want, I was watching. "
"8723150","8726170"," There's more buyers than sellers right now in this market today."
"8726670","8728590"," We have more buyers than sellers, real money buyers."
"8730250","8735870"," And we traded down and now we're trading sideways with mass buyers. "
"8737530","8742250"," So I wouldn't want to get trapped in any kind of margin at all today."
"8742810","8748550"," Anything, any trades you're making today should be in cash that you can lose and you don't feel the"
"8748550","8748790"," pain."
"8751350","8753410"," That's a very good question about MES contracts. "
"8753930","8755390"," I like short, under normal circumstances."
"8756850","8760370"," I use blowbacks for hedging."
"8761110","8765370"," If I ever hold longs overnight or shorts over, not shorts, but long puts over there and like that,"
"8765910","8766830"," I will stay awake. "
"8767030","8768170"," You guys will find me on Twitter, right?"
"8768830","8771350"," You guys know I'm on Twitter two, three in the morning."
"8772330","8777030"," Ready to fucking slam the sell button if I have to."
"8777210","8778990"," I don't want to lose money on an overnight hold. "
"8781250","8786730"," That's the only way to hedge if you're trading cash market in my view is using ES contracts or"
"8786730","8787310"," minis."
"8795290","8796310"," Yeah, different products."
"8798830","8802690"," That's why we show, that's why we show the, so that's a good fair question. "
"8802930","8808610"," Someone's saying, um, Willie, Willie Smug, we'd say an MES is a different product, does not depend"
"8808610","8809490"," on market makers."
"8812070","8813230"," Which is a very good point."
"8813370","8821030"," Why we show the MES contract here on BookMap is we like to, it's a better viewpoint of where levels"
"8821030","8823810"," are than the spy data. "
"8824070","8830870"," Spy data just basically shows like all the buy cells on the zeros and fives."
"8831730","8832930"," That's pretty much all it shows."
"8834030","8841910"," You get a little bit clearer picture on MES for where the levels really are, in my view. "
"8851350","8852970"," He has a confirmation problem, Willie."
"8855530","8857530"," Give me like them into a spread now instead of closing."
"8858190","8861530"," No, I'll just take the money and run and then I'll reposition. "
"8864770","8866530"," I'll look for a retracement at some point."
"8866970","8871950"," If it's like 38%, 50% retracement and then I'll go back in and grab some more."
"8872810","8876070"," And I'll just keep doing that all year long until, until you get a crash. "
"8884130","8887710"," Yeah, it's duration structure, it's duration structure."
"8892890","8895590"," The calls are in right now, are they zero data or not?"
"8895930","8896510"," Yeah, they're zero data."
"8896670","8897730"," I bought some cheap zero dates. "
"8898310","8898970"," I bought some more too."
"8899470","8904530"," I got a, I've been adding to the position."
"8904930","8908390"," So if I can get them down a little bit lower, they're definitely five cents right now. "
"8908470","8909230"," I might have to move them up."
"8909230","8913870"," I might cut them loose and buy like some 385s or something."
"8914110","8914790"," So they actually print. "
"8915170","8919430"," I mean, I'll just leave them on there because they've already been torched and just add to the"
"8919430","8920010"," position higher."
"8921990","8924170"," It's more of a protection trade."
"8925070","8926070"," It's different things. "
"8926230","8930990"," There's this inflation and economic slowdown off to mean a lower 2023 revenue growth in the U.S."
"8930990","8934870"," and Canada where the housing markets are slowing due to sharp tightening in conditions."
"8936150","8939610"," So if I'm in, so here, I'll simplify it for you."
"8940910","8946370"," So I'm in for $2.49 on Estau, okay, that's what my buy-in actually is. "
"8946850","8955030"," So if I was sitting here and I buy 50 cent, originally about 50 cent calls, and then I added"
"8955030","8956090"," a bunch of 10 cents."
"8958650","8961770"," So if we come down here, I'm going to print heavy on Estau."
"8961770","8964130"," If we start to trade higher here, right?"
"8964810","8966290"," So say we start blasting up. "
"8966590","8970390"," Let's say in the overnight we start coming in today, start blasting at any point."
"8971390","8972910"," In my Estau starts going down."
"8973330","8979290"," I'd make a quick, you know, a few thousand bucks on some zero day calls. "
"8979550","8980810"," That cost me nothing, right?"
"8980990","8981350"," Does that make sense?"
"8984210","8986610"," So it's just a counter trade to what I'm in."
"8992710","8994110"," And they're dirt cheap."
"8994450","8995450"," They cost me nothing. "
"8996930","9003630"," I'm not putting more and more risk on puts in one side of trade."
"9004010","9006550"," I'm just trying to buy dirt cheap shit."
"9008050","9010890"," Okay, so I can just tweet about JVM car 3835. "
"9011590","9013130"," Moving next drop better for bonds."
"9014110","9015570"," I'm wondering what it's going to be with pensions."
"9015870","9017270"," They let them use leverage towards the highs. "
"9017970","9019430"," How long does it take for pensions to do that?"
"9019430","9021170"," Tesla, Tesla's to break down bounds."
"9021610","9023150"," They're paying those 150s yet."
"9023390","9024850"," What is the put wall for Tesla?"
"9026130","9028250"," Yeah, yeah, 150 is the put wall. "
"9028750","9030330"," Kepting Tesla bounds at 150."
"9030770","9031990"," Still believe in the rally today, Cap."
"9032650","9033570"," Yeah, absolutely. "
"9033790","9038130"," The Canadian economy is vulnerable to a housing market correction in 2023."
"9038450","9042390"," Do you guys have any, do you guys have, you guys have zero idea about you guys?"
"9042590","9047290"," But I don't think any of you, no, I want to say probably 70%, 50% of you."
"9048590","9058570"," I've traded a ton of end of your quad which things and maybe 30% of you have, you guys"
"9058570","9059450"," can go back, right?"
"9059950","9063510"," And you can just pull the data from quad which things going back 20, 30 years. "
"9064770","9066070"," And they can go any way they want."
"9067090","9070850"," There is zero, anyone out there telling you that they know where the market's going today has no"
"9070850","9071750"," idea what they're talking about."
"9073310","9074110"," They're liars. "
"9075710","9076890"," They have zero idea."
"9079210","9084770"," It's all about repositioning for next year because zero to do with technicals or where the options"
"9084770","9086110"," market is or anything like that."
"9089630","9093510"," This is the one day of the year that you shouldn't be saying, do I think we're going here or"
"9093510","9094370"," do I think we're going there?"
"9095890","9098090"," And as a matter of fact, what was my tweet this morning?"
"9098950","9102730"," My tweet this morning I read it to you was, this is my tweet this morning. "
"9104030","9106330"," So I'll read it exactly to you guys want me to read it to you?"
"9108190","9110190"," This is my daily brief today."
"9111010","9112390"," Not much to add this morning."
"9112650","9119770"," Per yesterday's brief and the live stream yesterday, I was looking to target 38, 3d4, 3d5 by today,"
"9119990","9120630"," which is safe Friday. "
"9121370","9122430"," Seems like that has been achieved."
"9122830","9124730"," Notice how futures are bought and cashmark sold."
"9125590","9126370"," We talked about that yesterday. "
"9126750","9133070"," Some of you are wondering if we can take the gap down to 3750, 375.60. And this is where"
"9133070","9134330"," my only warning comes in."
"9134670","9136070"," Days like today can get wild."
"9137430","9139050"," Five to six percent moves. "
"9139730","9143990"," If you are a long short contract or any kind of margin, find yourself on the wrong side of that"
"9143990","9145970"," trade, skull and crossbones."
"9146250","9149690"," Maybe better to trade the day with defined loss potential."
"9151190","9154970"," And then the last part of the tweet was, now let's see if we can close the gap at 373,"
"9156630","9156630"," 375. "
"9157970","9162130"," And I wrote, it will be a risky quad or triple witching, however you look at it."
"9163090","9165130"," So that's my that's my view on today."
"9166170","9168830"," I post those on at captains alpha. "
"9169550","9172970"," That's the place where my positioning and my view on the market is."
"9172970","9175270"," In terminus time, 12 p.m. eastern time."
"9175510","9177550"," We are expecting comments from feds daily. "
"9177870","9181190"," I used to post that stuff on captain Jim James."
"9182250","9183530"," And it would get, it would get."
"9183570","9188550"," San Francisco Fed President daily discussing inflation, the economy and the federal reserve during"
"9188550","9192750"," a moderated conversation hosted by the American enterprise institutes. "
"9192750","9196850"," No text is expected from fed daily, but there will be a Q&A with the audience."
"9198630","9201130"," It would piss people off to post that stuff."
"9201390","9205130"," So what I did was I said, fuck it, I'm going to put it behind a pay wall, put a"
"9205130","9207210"," private wall and let you in. "
"9207410","9208910"," So if you want to read that stuff, you can."
"9210790","9214170"," It's a place that if you go in there and fuck around or anything, you get in the insta band."
"9215850","9217070"," That's where I post my thoughts. "
"9217310","9218950"," That's where I post my journal stuff for you guys."
"9219690","9222470"," It's kind of just a place that if you want to read that stuff, you can."
"9224770","9225970"," You don't like it. "
"9226110","9229490"," I like constructive criticism on that handle."
"9230270","9236990"," That is pretty much my journal for my positioning, my viewpoint to the market and that kind of"
"9236990","9237150"," stuff."
"9240030","9241470"," I try to separate the two. "
"9242230","9246810"," I've got to keep them separate because when you're like, I don't have a ton of followers, but when"
"9246810","9252130"," you get like 10,000 followers, 5,000, 10,000 followers, shit just gets wild."
"9252950","9255590"," Like my DMs are just like DM, DM, DM, DM."
"9255890","9257730"," I try to respond to every DM when I can. "
"9258450","9260990"," Sometimes I miss DMs because there's so many coming in."
"9261330","9264270"," My notifications are just like, they just non-stop."
"9264610","9266630"," Just like, try to go through notifications. "
"9267090","9268730"," I feel bad because I can't respond to everybody."
"9269390","9271030"," But then I see people like, they just go crazy."
"9271970","9274030"," Like Twitter can be really fucking nasty. "
"9274970","9278530"," So I just want like one place where I can be like, this is what I'm doing."
"9279330","9280650"," And then I got the public Twitter."
"9281690","9288910"," And then you see me here, of course, there's transition over here to on the live stream. "
"9289210","9292030"," And then I've got a website where I send out newsletters now."
"9293290","9296890"," And you guys can read that stuff in more depth."
"9297870","9301050"," If you haven't signed up there, it's CaptainJimJames.com."
"9302050","9304090"," I'll send you out my views on the market. "
"9305110","9306410"," I expand on my views on the market."
"9307870","9311110"," And if I've used change, I'll update those, of course."
"9312150","9314290"," So it's kind of like layered content or whatever. "
"9315050","9316930"," You get like layered Jim James."
"9327470","9328770"," Yeah, it's like Worldstar, right?"
"9329250","9330030"," It's turning the world star."
"9330250","9331110"," Twitter's turning the world star. "
"9338550","9340590"," You know, like, so John's saying something."
"9340770","9343170"," It's way better that the left is CCP."
"9343490","9346550"," Deep State picked a trough sensor machine that it was before Elon saved it. "
"9346850","9351790"," You know, my being upset with Elon has nothing to even do with that stuff."
"9352470","9359150"," It's got like, so it's not about my being upset with Elon has nothing to do with."
"9362610","9369910"," If you think he's right or wrong in what he's doing, my upsetness or why I'm out of Elon is"
"9369910","9373690"," because it's not how you should be acting as a CEO. "
"9375590","9376670"," Earring this stuff probably."
"9377170","9380110"," I could care less about how he wants to run the site."
"9382410","9386530"," I don't like that the Twitter blue thing wasn't well thought out or planned out. "
"9386890","9389690"," The execution of this stuff is kind of just bad."
"9390070","9391150"," It doesn't look good, right?"
"9393150","9398430"," Any and all this stuff should have been well thought out, released with some care and thought."
"9401230","9403230"," It's just not how companies are run. "
"9404010","9408970"," I don't know who's own companies out there in this stream, but it's not the way to run a company."
"9409970","9412470"," At least I disagree with that's how companies should run."
"9413070","9418370"," You guys, you can look right back to, I relate this on Twitter sometimes, you can relate this right"
"9418370","9424530"," back to Howard Hughes and he's a prime example of what happens. "
"9425750","9427390"," And it never ends well."
"9428030","9436710"," Regardless if you love what Howard Hughes did, you end up seeing, usually it ends up breaking"
"9436710","9437910"," something at some point."
"9447210","9448570"," Yeah, I don't like to see it. "
"9448570","9451730"," It's not a good look for a CEO."
"9452070","9454630"," You know, it's the CEO of companies that are supposed to be doing great things."
"9465650","9466510"," Hey, thanks, Jonathan. "
"9466770","9467390"," I appreciate it, man."
"9467870","9468870"," Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys."
"9469650","9471290"," I'm having a blast doing this, to be honest with you. "
"9472490","9476510"," We are now five minutes away from the top of the hour where we are expecting to hear comments from"
"9476510","9478630"," San Francisco Fed President Dailey."
"9478630","9483970"," He discusses inflation, the economy, and the Federal Reserve during a moderated conversation hosted"
"9483970","9485750"," by the American Enterprise Institute."
"9486310","9489770"," No text is expected to be released, but there will be a Q&A with the audience. "
"9490350","9493090"," So you're saying, inverse ETFs are better for sure."
"9493450","9494590"," Timeframes, I agree with that."
"9494830","9497110"," I don't feel like, I don't feel like babysitting it. "
"9498190","9501090"," They pay really well, but I'm not trying to time markets with that stuff."
"9501370","9503150"," I'm looking for a hedge on the market in case it crashes."
"9508490","9509490"," They're holding up well. "
"9509730","9511190"," I haven't lost anything on it."
"9511490","9512310"," Nothing on that trade."
"9513130","9514650"," No dollar, I'm up on that trade big time. "
"9514990","9516870"," That's a big, it's a sizable trade."
"9517670","9518470"," We got size on that trade."
"9520670","9522730"," But I'm still paying less than the savings account. "
"9527190","9528010"," Who's Gary Black?"
"9528670","9530130"," He blocked me a long time ago."
"9530910","9531650"," He doesn't like me."
"9531790","9532310"," He hates me. "
"9533170","9534290"," I upset him or something."
"9534710","9536990"," I came into my feed or something and made a comment."
"9537150","9539830"," I told him to go fuck himself, something like that. "
"9542250","9544550"," No, I know what it was."
"9544850","9551790"," I felt as though Gary Black was selling calls on Tesla and talking out of the other side of his"
"9551790","9551970"," mouth."
"9553390","9554950"," I was a little pissed off out of her something. "
"9555550","9556170"," Maybe that was it."
"9561610","9562430"," There you go."
"9562550","9565690"," Poor badger saying Gary Black's a straight up pump worth of an air in respect to it. "
"9566110","9571450"," I think personally this is my opinion and I can't prove it."
"9571590","9572030"," I have no evidence."
"9573450","9578310"," But I don't like how publicly he is with how much position he has in Tesla. "
"9581090","9585950"," And whatever he makes a statement about this is the ceiling on Tesla."
"9586170","9587870"," And then Tesla actually becomes a ceiling there."
"9587970","9593070"," I feel as though it's because he's got calls out in the market or selling calls out in the market. "

"10293840","10295160"," market to come down. "
"10295360","10299740"," Yeah I used to do the same thing with when I left Utah I had people ship it to me"

"11802060","11811320"," going there but you take the bear trade in steps and in stages through each level my view though on"
"11811320","11816940"," the fed right now is uh they think they can use words that the words aren't going to work uh"
"11816940","11821820"," they can come out here in the past couple of days i've been out here fucking spewing donkey shit"
"11821820","11828460"," they can they should have done 75 bps that's my view is that they should have just done 3075 bps"
"11828460","11832560"," market probably would have an update if they could have pulled the plug in the market whatever they"
"11832560","11840280"," wanted and they'd be fighting unemployment and instead they're it's just in my view when i look at"

"11997240","12004540"," said the weakness was at at on january 10th unless i'm wrong on that he he didn't from what i"
"12004540","12010120"," in the interview that i read watched from him he said uh sideways into january 10th and then"
"12010120","12014840"," january 10th you'd see an opportunity for weakness i could be wrong in that too i'm telling you"
"12014840","12019460"," you're wrong i could be fucking wrong in that so i'll have to watch the video again but from what"
"12019460","12024840"," i took away from the video was it was sideways and then weakness on january 10th and then weakness"
"12024840","12030540"," again i think on march which is where we have said the same thing that you get weakness in january"
"12030540","12037760"," and march for opportunities january march there's an opportunity for the market to crash and then"
"12037760","12046000"," again in uh november and january of november of 2023 and january of um 2024"
"12046000","12059430"," or at least that's for the uh all right my algo's got it in those three four places just"

"12064190","12069790"," sideways not productive he said but uh christmas rally is typically counterproductive it's just a"
"12069790","12075770"," grind i just grind slowly up if you guys ever see a christmas rally it's typically like um"
"12077050","12083170"," christmas rally is like this i kid you not it's it it's like watching paint dry it's just like this"
"12086930","12096710"," there's no no no nothing right you go sideways then it just comes up like this"
"12100630","12105030"," right you're trying to buy a zero date you can't buy me it's by a spread it goes like this"
"12107510","12113870"," then it goes like this and like three days have passed me like i'm fucking miser bleeding on this"
"12113870","12123350"," shit and you're that's the christmas rally typically slow grind up into the 24th sometimes extends"
"12123350","12129930"," to the 30th that's that's my version of the that's that's mostly my expectation of christmas"
"12129930","12139460"," rallies that's all it is it's so boring we'll be doing all kinds of stupid shit on this channel"
"12139460","12147100"," instead of that we'll place a call spread and see if it works and we'll see if they have a"
"12147100","12152540"," christmas rally it's just like it's like and we'll do other shit we're gonna do some classes and"

"12215180","12220360"," maintain its value in case we get a crash right so you can go sideways and then boom it drops"
"12220360","12226740"," uh if it goes sideways and doesn't drop you can take your money out of the hedge and not not"
"12226740","12233340"," lose it i know guys i i learned this on wall street bets years ago you can take um you"
"12233340","12239400"," can take hedges out that are two three years out and they'll just sit there and they don't uh use"
"12239400","12244560"," without it if you can do that anymore but back in the day people used to take uh believe uvxy"
"12244560","12254080"," none of uvxy spy oh no no no maybe maybe was the um the triple leverage that spx or"
"12254080","12259600"," whatever it's called i'll hook that up there's some trades you can take some triple leverage uh"
"12259600","12266680"," either spx or or vix i don't know if those products are still available you can take them out like"
"12266680","12271540"," two three years and if we had a crash they would just hit and you would lose any money on"
"12271540","12281940"," them if they if we if they didn't have a head or a crash uh no"
"12281940","12288840"," i wouldn't let's talk about uh bull call spreads well i wouldn't it wouldn't we'll talk let's talk"
"12288840","12305750"," about some real quick so um i'm always looking for like um like"
"12305750","12313250"," what i for what i for um a holiday rally you're asking maybe so if you're looking for a bull"
"12313250","12322350"," call spread for a holiday rally what do you want to see happen before you take that trade do you"
"12322350","12329910"," know we don't care about price or we do care about price in this context we do what would you"
"12329910","12339750"," be looking for here if you want to take a bull call spread"
"12339750","12349690"," down here so if we can close this gap down here into the close i would"
"12349690","12359670"," be game on for a bull spread game on and it also be looking at something else uh i'd"
"12359670","12364290"," be looking for let me close this uh spy shit for you guys i'm going to dump all the support"
"12364290","12374230"," these drawings on spy and i'm going to do just the market breadth indicator"
"12374230","12382230"," alone yeah i'm not going to do ppo's ppm's i'm just going to do the market breadth indicator alone"
"12384190","12399730"," i'm going to tell you why here just a second just"
"12399730","12430270"," a second i'll set this up okay"
"12433570","12443500"," so let's take a look here so this is uh market breadth indicator"
"12444340","12453910"," all on its own i'm not doing it with uh momentum any of that kind of stuff and i'm not"
"12453910","12462670"," gonna go just delete this let me uh do this on your own so i'm gonna trash that okay"
"12462670","12474370"," i'll uh i'll start here so i always like buying uh oversold conditions i"
"12474370","12480850"," don't care if the market's going up i don't care if the market's going down they work every single"
"12480850","12489130"," time every single time and that's because you can't sell into buyers if there are none does that"
"12489130","12498570"," make sense at some point there's no more buyers um no if they have a market crash uh that's where"
"12498570","12504530"," there's no more buyers and the price just goes to you know rock bottom right evening crashes uh"
"12504530","12511410"," this trade works uh you might have to hold it for the entire length of the trade but it still"
"12511410","12519230"," works uh i this there's a failure rate on this about one failure every 30 trades roughly if time it"
"12519230","12525910"," right roughly uh but you'll be pretty close it's like hand grenades and horseshoes so anyways it's"
"12525910","12532530"," not really relevant what's really relevant here is uh you can see right see right here we had this"
"12532530","12537890"," little right if you'd bought that trade you would have printed right take the money and run you're"
"12537890","12542430"," out i'm trying to chase that shit you can see we even rolled over some more you just take the"
"12542430","12547370"," money and run same thing down here backed oversold again we're not quite there right now right so"
"12547370","12554550"," you can't really take a bull trade right here in safety yet until uh we get one of these moments"
"12554550","12564370"," again down here we're way down here way oversold so you really can't be"
"12564370","12572050"," like um bullish here so what does that mean for you uh can you take a bull trade though in"
"12572050","12579510"," a short short of time print yes you can so uh i'm going to raise this up a little right"
"12579510","12585510"," here i'm not i don't really care about pricing here um i already know where i'm looking for 373"
"12585510","12595490"," right and you can see these are the sectors right utilities people are hiding utilities still 76.7 "
"12595490","12603430","% 10% on tech are real states that uh 38% still haven't cleaned those those bulls out yet"
"12603430","12609790"," we had to clean up the bulls in a bunch of different sectors right now we haven't done yet so"
"12609790","12614790"," we have work to do we have the bears have worked to do to clean out the rest of these"
"12614790","12623230"," freaking bulls inside of the market right um but what it can do is we're looking for here"
"12623230","12632770"," i can look for places for retracements and market breadth so if this is the peak right here and if"
"12632770","12640470"," i think that this down here is uh zero line right for me i can probably grab this and bring"
"12640470","12647150"," this over right where i can think it's gonna go what's gonna what's they're gonna be"
"12647150","12656570"," i'm gonna"
"12656570","12665740"," so what i'm looking for is can i get a little bit of maybe snap a line right here just"
"12665740","12675660"," snap a line right here and then i'm going to delete this"
"12675660","12685600"," thing right there and i'm going to look for a bounce once the market breadth indicator gets down"
"12685600","12693940"," to this white line 239 239 21 you can set an alert on this shit too like right click set"
"12693940","12701060"," an alert and uh you get to go but i'm going to keep an eye on it we're close to"
"12701060","12706480"," it i'm going to i'm going to bet right i'm going to bet that this white line right here is"
"12706480","12714860"," going to probably signify closing the gap so if i wanted to take a trade on a short a short"
"12714860","12721900"," dated trade on the on the spy i'm going to look for a you know small bounce on the spy"
"12721900","12731400"," and maybe take like a week long two-week long call spread and then as"
"12731400","12737600"," soon as that retracement is done it matches up like what's going on over here so if i see that"
"12737600","12747000"," i see that we sell off finally down at this bell if it's on monday i'm going to place the"
"12747000","12754340"," call spread looking at the 38 percent maybe like the zero line here to 38 percent and it's probably"
"12754340","12761980"," a hundred percent trade i'm going to put the time on it for uh December 30th probably close it by"
"12761980","12779430"," 24th so we'll look for that as we head into the close today and tomorrow so"
"12779430","12791050"," it's a it's a it's a market breadth indicator uh that tracks the advanced decline basically"
"12791050","12799750"," more buys more sells how who's long in each sector of uh the sub sectors of the the spider comp"
"12799750","12809350"," the spider eat or the spider product the sp y 500 that is why the spider 500 uh"
"12809350","12818670"," ETF and then there's smaller ETFs that make up uh the 500"
"12818670","12828110"," and so it looks for uh everybody sold out of every sector like you want to"
"12828110","12837190"," people are always like we hit bottom yet and i'm like no not yet you need to have like breadth"
"12837190","12846300"," at zero not zero but you want to see most most buyers be sellers at that point length of time"
"12846300","12856540"," this involves like length of time and trade and stuff like that too a more granular level you'll"
"12856540","12862600"," have people say goals are not well hedged that's what they're implying they're saying that um"
"12862600","12869060"," everyone has sold out of their lungs and they're now hedged right now they're hedged so the market"
"12869060","12874400"," can go up i don't know if even they know that when they say that they say people i hear"
"12874400","12877820"," people say the market's not well hedged i'm like i wonder if they know what that actually means"
"12877820","12885180"," what it means is that they've sold their lungs they're now hedged for a crash now they're well"
"12885180","12902260"," hedged for professionals at least and then um we start to come up again uh"
"12902260","12907800"," it's easy when we're down there it's a very easy trade when we're down there you're just looking"
"12907800","12916440"," for normally i for time so let's say it was uh let's say i spend a hundred dollars to make"
"12916440","12922520"," three hundred dollars typically that's what i'll do i'll look for like us not specifically that"
"12922520","12931760"," number but three hundred percent on the trade with one to three months on it and i'm"
"12931760","12940020"," looking to to the numbers can change on the actual spread i'm looking for capitulation moments i'm"
"12940020","12946000"," looking for where there's known support looking for the mbi to be there and then i'm looking for um"
"12946000","12953520"," checking the ppo and the ppm's and if we're in that capitulation stage that i can get a really"
"12953520","12961700"," cheap price uh i will take on with size a call spread and i'm trying to scale it so that"
"12963180","12968300"," uh if i'm trying to scale it one to three months out and trying for let's say spend a hundred"
"12968300","12977060"," dollars i'm trying to get it to make 300 so that i can close the spread at 30 profit because"
"12977060","12982660"," most spreads don't print until the last half of the time that they're on i'm only trying to capture"
"12982660","12989460"," the first 30 percent so i'll typically be able to catch that directionally if i if i've timed the"
"12989460","12995200"," bottom accurately if i haven't timed the bottom accurately it'll typically come back in print"
"12995200","13002250"," within typically towards the end of the life that spread when you see on opac states one to three"
"13002250","13008650"," months out you'll notice that in the opacs you'll see the price will sneak up into the close or"
"13008650","13015790"," it'll sneak down into the close that's because other or institutions and banks are trading spreads"
"13015790","13020950"," they're trying to hit a specific price point now so sometimes you get stuck in these trades until"
"13020950","13030610"," the bitter bitter bitter end um but not always and then i just i hold that for whatever however"
"13030610","13036470"," long it takes some people will come in here when they learn about this and they'll they'll just"
"13036470","13044230"," trade zero dates or weeklies or three month calls uh but what i don't like about that trade if you"
"13044230","13051090"," do that is here's a prime example uh i'll find people trade that way it's i find it too risky"
"13052950","13062660"," uh few but what i find happens to me i used to make this trade i"
"13062660","13067480"," used to make this trade in a risky way and a good way to look at it from a risky"
"13067480","13077100"," way would be um how you can get burned in this trade would be let's say you were following this"
"13077100","13086670"," right here let's say in your mind uh let's say in your mind you're like you're like okay it took"
"13086670","13091050"," the trade and i'm going to hold it all the way up here you could get trapped in that trade"
"13091050","13097930"," right it would have worked this time if you're like i'm going full max bore you would have lost it"
"13097930","13104850"," this time but if you're but if you're taking the trade for only this much gains and it doesn't"
"13104850","13110650"," really matter if you're not getting greedy right you're gonna you're gonna hit it you're gonna hit"
"13110650","13116710"," it this line actually doesn't matter in reality you'll see that you'll see us come down here i'll"
"13116710","13121470"," be just looking for the portion of the trade matter of fact in here i ended up not trading a"
"13121470","13126430"," bunch of this with size people were pissed off at me and i was like i don't give a fine"
"13126430","13132670"," fuck if i can make you know in a good year if i can make 6 to 9 to 12"
"13132670","13139810"," trades in a great year like an out market if i can make 9, 10, 12 trades of size for"
"13139810","13146570"," 100 gains uh i give a fine fuck with the market does now down market if i can only make"
"13146570","13154290"," four five six of those the only key in this trade is that it keeps me in the market no"
"13154290","13161670"," matter what so i'm in the market i don't lose these trades um you should have one trade and you're"
"13161670","13168510"," i don't care what it is either you should have one trade that does two things because i used to"
"13168510","13176410"," try to do complex spreads and they had a high wind rate but not a high capture rate so i"
"13176410","13184810"," could trade 9 out of 10 times and win 30 percent on the 9 of 10 trades but then i'd"
"13184810","13192810"," lose one and i would lose significant money and my taxes afterwards wasn't enough to really keep me"
"13192810","13199350"," grown in account so i was trying to seek out a way to make a lot of money on a"
"13199350","13205170"," almost guaranteed trade with a with a high enough percentage of wind in time in having to pay taxes"
"13205170","13215390"," that uh they're like hundred percent hammers every time uh so you"
"13215390","13221330"," know like sometimes people will come to me and they'll say things like why didn't you just do zero"
"13221330","13224530"," dates why didn't you just do weeklies on that whole every time it hit every time we're down there"
"13224530","13230110"," you just be hammered hammered but i think i've gotten caught in that shit man you just lose fucking"
"13230110","13237450"," money i don't lose fucking money so i want like one little baby that i do that i that i"
"13237450","13245930"," don't fuck with no matter what it works it's easy it doesn't need to be managed i don't have to"
"13245930","13261190"," worry about it does that make sense it doesn't"
"13261190","13268250"," make sense to maybe out there yeah i've got a nice hedge man i'm gonna if we can get down"
"13268250","13274710"," here i'm gonna close it today if we can get down here i'm closing the hedge my my calls are"
"13274710","13284470"," worthless they're like penny i'm gonna call hedge now and i am uh long on the"
"13284470","13294390"," dial burning uh i"
"13294390","13300830"," don't know tell me so captain what are we playing now tell me a good tell me a good trade"
"13300830","13310490"," uh i don't know i'm an s-dow march 17 25 c and i'm also in some calls"
"13310490","13328240"," for 390 c for today for zero dates that's my position uh do"
"13328240","13335380"," i use stop loss of mbi trade no never never have i put in a sell order for the 30"
"13335380","13341300"," percent and then i put it in i have another trading i've went multiple accounts with tasty works so"
"13341300","13351220"," i don't look at it all day long yeah i don't look at the uh i don't"
"13351220","13358240"," look at the trade so if i buy it for a dollar i set a sell at three dollars right"
"13358240","13364320"," or not free sorry at a one dollar it's one extra dollar on it i don't set the sell at"
"13364320","13369700"," three hundred percent ever because it typically won't well sometimes they'll print but it's rare"
"13369700","13378880"," the first like 25 well the first 50 percent of a of a call spread typically prints if you pick"
"13378880","13385200"," the right direction right away the second half of that shit that shit will like take even if you're"
"13385200","13389320"," going the right direction that shit will take into almost the end there's no reason to stay in that"
"13389320","13398780"," trade for the other 50 percent why not take off the s-down leave those as lotos well so that"
"13398780","13406260"," you've got it so let's put so if you're a bull out there right if you're a bull right believe"
"13406260","13419040"," it from this perspective if we're going up right now right here's the perspective what if"
"13419040","13423980"," i can turn this upside down so if you were a bull right now pretend the screen was upside down"
"13423980","13433500"," right and we're up here and you take calls and we start going up okay we're going up right now"
"13433500","13442420"," as we're heading up here right you start to see cheap puts while you're long calls right"
"13442420","13450640"," you're going to start saying to yourself well shit i got to look for cheap puts in here does that"
"13450640","13457720"," make sense and you can throw like 10 20 30 cents at them just in case you make this turn"
"13457720","13463540"," at any point does that make sense to you guys actually i think i can flip the screen around you"
"13463540","13467960"," know let me try that right now hold on a second i'm gonna try to do some right that's pretty"
"13467960","13474400"," cool let's see if i can do this give me a second we're gonna make a give you a perspective"
"13474400","13482060"," right now try to change your see if you guys can figure this out let me see if i can"
"13482060","13495220"," do this let me see if i can hold on a second i'm checking so oh"
"13495220","13500760"," no i see hold on i got it locked right now okay so i just locked it i'll give you"
"13500760","13509300"," a second i'll see if i can transform here any transform stretch center flip vertical okay check"
"13509300","13519230"," this out it's gonna be pretty cool ah it didn't work last i was giving an invert"
"13519230","13526090"," invert scale blending will hide or move hold on a second maybe i'll flip this screen or upside down"
"13526090","13536030"," stretch the fit center screen flip vertical rotate 180 degrees oh yeah baby there we go nope that"
"13536030","13546160"," didn't work did that work yeah okay did that work oh no"
"13546160","13553960"," that didn't work hold on a second give me a second hold on i'm trying here give me a second"
"13553960","13562120"," transform okay perfect there we go i got it okay"
"13562120","13567000"," this is awesome i don't know if i can do this on the screen because it's gonna be kind of"
"13567000","13575600"," wonky so if if you would pretend this pretend we were wrong right now right say we had calls right"
"13575600","13584320"," now so look at it so this is perspective you guys can see this now right so if we were"
"13584320","13594100"," in calls right now this is so cool if we're in calls right now and we're making money just cranking"
"13594100","13600740"," money right now what is your next move here if you're in calls so start looking for some cheap puts"
"13600740","13607860"," some cheap zero dates some cheap puts for monday does that make sense maybe at the bell you'll be"
"13607860","13612880"," looking for some cheap puts maybe on monday if there's one more gap up you'll be looking for some"
"13612880","13618000"," cheap puts does that make sense so if i'm making money on on the on the call side right now"
"13618000","13628440"," i'm starting to look to hedge my call position with some puts cheap puts preferably do you"
"13628440","13637650"," guys understand this now this is so cool i kind of like being able to flip it upside down and"
"13637650","13647490"," show you guys what my perspective is here you guys understand what i'm saying now"
"13647490","13653330"," so just pretend we're in calls right now would you be looking to exit your calls and looking for"
"13653330","13663750"," cheap puts here I'm"
"13663750","13675020"," going to put this back correct it's kind of weird right we're"
"13675020","13685210"," back to normal again we're back to normal again dammit hold on a second i"
"13685210","13694170"," don't know what's going on here hold on a second to get transformed here give me a second here oh"
"13694170","13703730"," no hold on there we go oh shit"
"13703730","13715070"," hold on a second here so that rotator 180 degrees that should be uh transformed"
"13715070","13724800"," we could do it again one more time my god"

"17327480","17332720"," win but most put spreads when you start to get into that like twenty five to fifty percent range"
"17332720","17338260"," they won't print not always but they don't all they usually don't print like statistically they"
"17338260","17344940"," won't print the full hundred percent until you're closer to the end of the um the put spreads uh"
"17344940","17350840"," life so the time that you have to be in that spread for the gains aren't worth it you could"
"17350840","17355640"," place two or three more put spreads in the life it's more about protection for the swings in the"

"17374640","17379700"," taking them for like a hundred bucks for a three hundred dollar like three hundred percent print"
"17379700","17386440"," and then take take it out at the hundred dollars so it's it's really a hundred percent print if"
"17386440","17391600"," that makes sense so that you don't have to stay in on the entire length of time so that you"
"17391600","17399540"," can cut them loose uh there's ways i'll look for a graph that shows you um like a like a"
"17399540","17406100"," credit put spread will directionally pay you quicker and faster uh a debit put spread will pay you"
"17406100","17410340"," some of it and then typically it's time then that you're making your money towards the end of the"
"17410340","17415020"," life that spread sometimes if you well you can get the hundred percent print early but it has to go"
"17415020","17420840"," way way way outside of uh range for you to get the full hundred percent or no you won't get"
"17420840","17430520"," a hundred you like ninety or something typically yes i still feel like we go"
"17430520","17436420"," lower we we're we're facing so right now okay i'm going to talk about short medium and long term"

"17450760","17459000"," on the medium term we're going to close out lower lows okay we'll have another retracement trade"
"17459000","17463920"," and come back up and then i'm going to be looking for a date with destiny down at the weekly"
"17463920","17473660"," moving average that's the full bear trade from that moment you close everything in your flat and"
"17473660","17480040"," you want to wait and see if you're a bull or bear for the direction of the market if we"
"17480040","17484620"," break below the weekly moving average we're going to start looking for some deep deep deep deep"
"17484620","17490920"," deep bear trades if we bounce off the weekly average we're going to look way higher we're going to"
"17490920","17502040"," be looking at like 420 to make to make sense good"
"17502040","17508500"," if they can pay like five hundred percent then you should be taking the money uh and repositioning"

"17526040","17532000"," know what i would tell you um chase the better way to tell you this is run some spreads with"
"17532000","17537180"," with no money like uh hundred dollar like literally i spent a hundred dollars on a on a spread"
"17537180","17545240"," that's like one month out three months out a week out especially if you pick the direction and just"
"17545240","17551640"," let them run to the end because you can visualize when and where you would have made your money and"
"17551640","17556220"," hopefully you'll take a spread that goes against you that comes back into the money at the end of"
"17556220","17561580"," its life because it'll show you the the it'll visualize you'll be able to visualize the ups and"
"17561580","17565840"," downs of them and i'd run them right to expire and then close them because then you can i've had"
"17565840","17574960"," spreads like i had an amazon spread one time that uh went directionally wrong on me and i held it"
"17574960","17584720"," to the end and my thesis was right but it didn't fucking print until the last three days so spreads"
"17584720","17590680"," are weird if they start to not weird but they start if they start to print uh you can cut"
"17590680","17595800"," let you get more complicated and cut legs off and just let them run but that gets sketchy too if"
"17595800","17600860"," the market turns around just looking for a sure fucking thing up look at every goddamn day that's"
"17600860","17610720"," why i like them getting a little bit of a market turn here uh a"

"17928700","17934900"," on on on twitter and they're like i what i made uh three hundred percent trade it's typically"
"17934900","17939100"," they're not typically but when you see them do it all the time like three thousand percent gainer"

"18002590","18009630"," you'll see like puts let's say at three dollars a 30 delta put it like three dollars because you"
"18009630","18019530"," have 30 30 dollars to call it like 50 cents or something so it's like lopsided this uh FOMC"
"18019530","18024610"," meeting they had done both sides so you would see like a 30 dollars put for three bucks 30 dollars"

"18177180","18183080"," sometimes pad these things if that's if that's also taken into consideration whether where the"

"18358800","18367060"," i'd like to see like some kind of consolidation then i move up and that would be like this would"
"18367060","18378680"," be your 30 38 percent retracement 61.8 possibly 50 and then this move higher not"

"18383700","18392900"," how does that translate to something like this right then you get the move higher you can see it"
"18392900","18400640"," right down here is one see another one right here you buy and you keep moving something like that"
"18400640","18409620"," that's that's my my thesis at least uh you know my thesis can be broken i might miss the trade"

"21107340","21107660"," I don't care."
"21107960","21110920"," I'm looking for the, for the big fat finger to come off."
"21111600","21112800"," This is an arbitrage trade. "
"21113620","21115300"," These things cost me seven cents."
"21115500","21115960"," I think so."
"21116560","21120200"," We'll see if they, uh, they're not expensive. "
"21120520","21120960"," They're very cheap."

"21141640","21142980"," Three, four, five of them. "

"21168300","21169720"," Could see a rip in Tesla."
"21171100","21172420"," It's a very, it's a big long shot. "
"21173820","21176440"," It's a high risk, a high rate of failure."
"21177420","21179060"," So you can't spend any money on the trade."
"21179060","21180880"," It has to be like pennies. "
"21182020","21186200"," Uh, if they pin it, they'll expire worthless, of course."
"21188080","21192700"," Uh, but it's, it's, it's this, uh, bet that they're going to lift, they're going to lift this up at"
"21192700","21193140"," some point."
"21195400","21196180"," Sometimes they do. "
"21196440","21199640"," So what you'll do is you'll end up seeing like doom and gloom."

"21204800","21206900"," Um, so it's this whole thing where. "
"21207500","21212520"," Uh, it should, you should be like, it should, everything should be awful."
"21212960","21213720"," Like more, more awful."
"21213840","21218680"," It becomes the, uh, the more highly likely of a chance of a move higher. "
"21220240","21221920"," Like the more doom and gloom, the better."
"21229740","21233680"," Whenever, whenever someone, whenever we're like pumping, I'm not buying calls."
"21233680","21236600"," Whenever we're in the shits, that's when buying calls. "
"21238160","21244200"," Whenever, whenever we're in the, uh, like the worst of the worst doom and gloom, it's always calls."
"21244500","21250340"," Whenever we're in the, um, crazy puppet to the moon, um, trying to sell out of calls."
"21260400","21261820"," It's pretty simple. "
"21262880","21263740"," It's not that hard."
"21269060","21272660"," Take a second attack again on VWAP and S two."
"21273940","21277140"," You want to see a break above here. "
"21277200","21281760"," If you don't get the break, you don't ever really want to see one and then two."
"21282280","21284500"," And they'll, then they'll roll it over this storm."
"21284500","21288080"," Cuts really want to put 200, 200, 250,000. "
"21288560","21289000"," That's level here."
"21293510","21297530"," You don't want to see, you know, one attempts failure, second attempt failure."
"21306250","21310390"," Oh, they're really trying to put just some kid in the, I bet there's some kid in the back room"
"21310390","21312550"," in the dungeon of JPM headquarters. "
"21312890","21315250"," That's like, got Jamie Diamond Collins saying."
"21315990","21320010"," Do not let Tesla close any higher than 150."
"21328020","21330340"," I've got, I've got so much money riding in this trade. "
"21330500","21331560"," You can't let it go up or down."
"21338080","21340520"," There's some DJN punks on fin to it."

"21378260","21380180"," You're looking for a flinch. "
"21380380","21383720"," You're looking for the flinch into the, into the clothes that does, does it always happen?"
"21383900","21383960"," No."
"21385120","21386220"," But you're looking for that flinch."
"21388180","21393680"," You see, if you see that flinch happen and you jump on it, you can usually score a bunch of"
"21393680","21393920"," money. "
"21394780","21396720"," You steal it from old fat white guys."
"21396920","21397480"," You guys know that, right?"

"21698260","21699680"," They don't serve their purpose anymore. "
"21699980","21700820"," They used to serve their purpose."
"21700820","21701680"," They don't do that anymore."
"21701900","21703020"," Those days are over. "
"21704180","21707880"," It's all about no more fundamentals, no more TA, no more nothing."

"21897320","21900700"," It's got to burn through some of this. "
"21900780","21902560"," These might be late sellers right here."
"21902680","21905760"," I would give more."
"21905960","21908620"," I would give more power to the dealers here. "
"21909900","21913440"," Dealers are, you know, eight percent, nine, nine percent of the market."
"21915400","21917160"," Or they can steamroll late sellers."
"21917720","21918540"," So we'll see if they do. "
"21924280","21929500"," So far right now, they're not calling an imbalance, but there is a buy side imbalance."

"22022040","22026200"," We're just talking about this, our first date we ever had when we had our second child. "
"22028580","22032060"," And of course we have weight for the child to get older and older enough so that we could."

"22624760","22626620"," I don't care what they say. "
"22626840","22628780"," There's nothing they could say on a Friday that I care about."
"22630320","22635140"," That's master says seeing tentative signs of inflation rises are stabilizing and not calling a peak"
"22635140","22635400"," there."
"22636280","22638140"," Don't you trigger a stop loss in that trade?"
"22644860","22646900"," I'm going to create that volatility for a push. "
"22650220","22653940"," And that's master says I expect to see volatility in the inflation numbers."
"22655020","22657580"," You guys want another snap of line here for you?"
"22665640","22667520"," One, two, three."
"22667980","22669600"," I'm hoping to get this last push right here. "
"22671640","22675280"," Master adding that we need consistent cumulative evidence on inflation easing."
"22682230","22683670"," Are you serious they closed them on you?"

"22753040","22755900"," And they went up to like 24 cents and they held there."
"22756680","22760360"," I felt like the dealers were like take 24 cents or get out and get out. "
"22761540","22762900"," So I didn't close them."
"22763660","22768740"," I left them open."
"22768740","22771620"," I think about like 12 cents 24 cents. "
"22771680","22772520"," They held there."
"22773400","22774760"," Like hey get out of the straight."
"22775040","22776780"," So I did or I didn't stayed in them. "
"22776840","22778000"," They went down at six cents."
"22779220","22780860"," I sold out and lost."
"22781560","22782760"," I might have been five cents. "
"22782900","22783560"," It was like seven cents."
"22783640","22784380"," I think that I lost."
"22785240","22786300"," So I get out of the trade. "
"22787180","22789380"," I was like I to 50% lost in this trade."

"22801900","22804300"," It's Mr. says that it will take time for inflation."
"22804540","22805160"," So pissed. "
"22807820","22809400"," I was so pissed."
"22813820","22815060"," Like they like they knew."
"22815680","22818440"," Like they were just like here take the money went out of here, man. "

"23133780","23135200"," Tagged it one more time all the way down."
"23135880","23137460"," So you've got this first level right here."
"23138420","23139500"," Trying to break through. "
"23140220","23145440"," And you're trying to get to S1 on the bell, 386.52. Once you bash through this one."
"23146760","23151820"," You got nothing but air gap up here to get to 386.52. To make sense?"
"23154440","23156180"," Trying to bash right through right here."
"23157700","23159140"," And see where they are right here. "
"23175330","23184510"," How are you trying to think of, you know what"
"23184510","23186810"," I'll tell you what?"
"23186930","23189290"," You know what I'll tell you what?"
"23189730","23197810"," I hire people on what the fuck is the name of that place."
"23198170","23198910"," I don't have to ask my wife."
"23199690","23206470"," There's a website out there where you hire people to paint your house and shit and do that kind of"
"23206470","23207190"," stuff and do. "
"23207430","23208110"," I paint these guys."
"23208610","23211550"," They'll come in and paint rooms and shit for $150."
"23212870","23214570"," They do two or three rooms in a day. "
"23214570","23218090"," And they're making like three, four hundred bucks, five hundred bucks in a day."
"23219670","23220390"," Now, painting."
"23221210","23222190"," What do you need for that shit?"
"23222410","23225370"," Rollers, brushes, plastic tarps. "
"23227330","23228770"," I pay for the paint, so."
"23235610","23236930"," No, it's one of those."
"23237310","23238890"," It's not five or it's not task rabbit. "
"23240690","23243250"," It's like, nope, it's not Angie's list."
"23244090","23244670"," They're expensive."
"23244670","23246690"," I tried Angie's list. "
"23246930","23247870"," They didn't do that well."
"23248250","23252930"," I'll have to ask my wife the company that we use, but it's like those companies."
"23253850","23254830"," Here, let me look it up. "
"23259720","23260520"," Where is it called?"
"23261840","23263260"," Let me look and see if you can find it."
"23273610","23274410"," A thumbtack."
"23274790","23275510"," We use thumbtack. "
"23277110","23279170"," We pay them good money."
"23280410","23284410"," I'm assuming that they can walk away with like three to three to five hundred bucks a day in cash."
"23285550","23289650"," I'm going to assume that's better than like Uber driving or any of that kind of stuff. "
"23293320","23298700"," So if you're broke, Lord, Penté, I'd say go sign up for something like that."
"23298980","23300920"," I like what's the hardest."
"23302840","23305120"," I'm looking at this because I rehab houses. "
"23305340","23308320"," Probably the easiest thing you can do for work is in a house is like painting."
"23309460","23310380"," It's like the easiest thing."
"23311340","23317240"," You just have to, you just have to be clean and you just have to be attention, like detailed,"
"23317540","23318220"," detail oriented. "
"23318980","23320700"," You, I know you run a CNC machine."
"23322500","23326940"," So I'm sure that you're detail oriented, intelligent and clean."
"23331250","23332910"," Travis is trying to do blood red. "
"23336670","23338150"," Yeah, thumbtack is the one."
"23339970","23349960"," Yeah, we're not done"
"23349960","23350380"," going up."
"23350560","23350880"," Sure. "
"23350960","23351780"," It's coming off the market."
"23353200","23353780"," Oh, yeah."
"23353880","23357480"," They're killing my calls right now on on on Tesla. "
"23358300","23360120"," Those are those are big fat zero."
"23361740","23362380"," Hold on."
"23362380","23363860"," I'm going to look at the Tesla. "
"23364500","23365040"," Oh, yeah."
"23365160","23366060"," They slammed it down again."
"23370140","23372680"," I should have just taken the trade on the spy right then there. "
"23382650","23384030"," Oh, you're partially disabled."
"23384570","23385290"," That sucks."
"23393930","23394330"," That's right. "
"23394430","23395810"," 4,000 for right on Superman."
"23398590","23399830"," Yeah, I've done well this week."
"23399910","23400670"," It's been a very good week. "
"23401490","23403390"," Like overall, it's been a good week."
"23403570","23404950"," I'm fairly happy."
"23405830","23409990"," Like I had a like, it's like, you know, you like talk to your stuff. "
"23410150","23414170"," We got one major thing, which was don't fucking lose your money this week."
"23415270","23417450"," Like just don't leave the market losing money."
"23417450","23420310"," And then my second thing was trying to make some money this week. "
"23421490","23422850"," And I did good."
"23423190","23423730"," I didn't do bad."
"23423890","23424350"," I did great. "
"23424810","23425590"," I did very good."
"23425970","23427530"," So I'm happy."
"23427890","23429970"," And all this shit goes away after today. "
"23430270","23434190"," So you should we should see some kind of a."
"23435810","23437510"," We should see some kind."
"23439490","23442190"," Never retracement play coming into Monday."
"23444270","23448570"," So even if we sell this off into the ballot, we sell this off into tomorrow into Monday. "
"23449390","23454150"," I'm looking for some kind of a retracement trade into Monday, Tuesday."
"23455030","23456090"," And then we'll get bearish again."
"23463530","23467230"," So just to say and donate plasma, 900 bucks a month, that's really good. "
"23481810","23482330"," Right on right on."
"23482910","23483870"," Let's do a way to look at life."
"23485890","23488710"," I used to I used to live like a I used to live like a king man. "
"23488730","23489510"," I don't do that anymore."
"23489830","23491230"," I understand that part of life."
"23491630","23501570"," I don't I don't I look like a no looking a popper, but I"
"23501570","23503130"," live within my means 100%. "
"23503710","23505590"," I'm trying to retire and sell around the world."

"23620740","23622600"," Oh, they read borrowed Tesla down here."
"23625260","23626140"," They spiked. "
"23626700","23627740"," You guys watching Tesla?"
"23628520","23631100"," Giant volume bar spike on Tesla right now."
"23631840","23633000"," And they didn't pay me."
"23633120","23635000"," They actually burned all the calls. "
"23636980","23639280"," They're like ultra scam Tesla there too."
"23640380","23644280"," Test out a giant green bar that went to 151 47."
"23645200","23649960"," And then they dumped it and they took every single call on the call side and turned to zero. "
"23654330","23659290"," Put that back up for you."
"23665910","23667630"," You watching that Tesla right now?"
"23667990","23670170"," They have a giant green bar and Tesla to one."
"23672950","23673910"," 151 49. "
"23674710","23676170"," And then they slammed it straight down."
"23676730","23678190"," They turned every call to zero."
"23678470","23680250"," If you're if you're in the money or outside the money. "
"23688480","23689440"," That's okay."
"23691300","23692500"," I'm a believer."
"23693200","23694140"," I'm a Tesla believer. "
"23695360","23698700"," You want to build an airplane?"
"23699220","23699620"," Hell yeah."
"23703600","23709980"," Yeah, I'm in this conundrum right now with I'm in this conundrum right now because my youngest has"
"23709980","23712260"," about nine years left of school."
"23714100","23717300"," My oldest my time frame right now is my oldest goes to college. "
"23720050","23724860"," And I take the my oldest goes to college."
"23724860","23727520"," They take the or my youngest comes with me sailing."
"23729120","23731820"," If we can get the sellable market to a reasonable price. "
"23732640","23733740"," I'll take my daughter sailing."
"23735060","23736460"," If we don't get my."
"23738040","23742360"," I don't know if I take my daughter with me or if I'm going to wait until she gets out"
"23742360","23743260"," of school or into college. "
"23743840","23745780"," That would be nine or eight years now I think."
"23748670","23749870"," So we're in that same predicament."
"23758610","23759710"," Yeah, they zeroed calls. "
"23760210","23762330"," So they zeroed calls right now they're still at zero."
"23763230","23765890"," And they're giving another little pump coming up right now in Tesla."
"23767950","23769150"," Now they just dumped it again. "
"23769430","23770210"," So I'm still holding them."
"23770290","23770790"," I haven't sold them."
"23772070","23773310"," They haven't taken them away from me. "
"23779140","23779740"," So they're."
"23787340","23789100"," Yeah, I'm still thinking about buying some."
"23789260","23790360"," They've got these one sixties. "
"23790680","23791240"," I might buy them."
"23792640","23795020"," They got one sixties for December."
"23796340","23797040"," Twenty third. "
"23797900","23800180"," And they're two dollars and eight cents right now."
"23810010","23811850"," I think they're two dollars and eight cents right now."
"23811970","23813730"," I'm looking at them for the open on Monday. "
"23814890","23815810"," They're a little pricey."
"23817570","23818610"," But you know how that goes."
"23818810","23820870"," They're in a print printing like ten or twelve and twenty dollars. "
"23821130","23821210"," So."
"23823090","23824130"," I'm watching the last."
"23824610","23825910"," We've got how many more minutes left?"
"23826110","23827550"," We've got six minutes left. "
"23837900","23839980"," Talk about shadiness into the bell here, huh?"
"23842760","23844760"," Complete shadiness in the bell and Tesla right now."
"23847000","23849380"," They're like, we need your money to pay for these puts over here."
"23850140","23851660"," They're like Jamie Diamonds, my buddy. "
"23852140","23852820"," You got to pay him."
"23854700","23855780"," They were cheap though."
"23856040","23857160"," They were they weren't a lot of money. "
"23857260","23858460"," They were very, very, very cheap."
"23863510","23864370"," I'm still watching them."
"23864450","23865810"," They could do something the last minute or so. "
"23866370","23867370"," Watch them not even watch."
"23867550","23869390"," Watch it go up and they don't even fucking pay them."
"23869390","23870450"," That pissed me off. "
"23873460","23875800"," They're like one fifty sixty five right now."
"23876240","23878320"," I wonder if they hit it exactly one fifty zero."
"23883280","23886000"," And the puts on the crazy part is the puts on the three. "
"23886200","23890300"," The puts on the one fifty P's are now worth four cents."
"23890780","23895020"," So they've taken the call side and every last dollar from the put side."
"23895520","23899840"," Every last penny from the put side to get spy screaming up into the clothes here. "
"23899940","23901400"," Now three eighty four forty nine."
"23902020","23903560"," Last few minutes for the close."
"23904160","23905500"," We've got four minutes left. "
"23906340","23907680"," Five minutes left until the bow."
"23916880","23918060"," Hey, welcome Chase man."
"23918140","23919280"," I hope you made some money today doing that. "
"23923700","23926360"," I don't care if you get P.D.T. you can open another one."
"23927300","23929300"," You just go sign up for another tasty trades account."
"23930040","23932380"," Then you transfer your money over and you'll be fine. "
"23938160","23938620"," Fuck it."
"23938680","23939600"," I'll just hold them right into the close."
"23939980","23940480"," I don't give a fuck. "
"23943280","23944040"," I'll hold them right in."
"23944100","23945120"," I'll hold them into the close close."
"23951570","23952350"," They've got a."
"23958180","23959460"," I don't think so man. "
"23959940","23960820"," I think it is true."
"23961460","23963500"," I think you go right in there and you just open another count."
"23963800","23964980"," I think that's a hundred percent true. "
"23966060","23966720"," I don't know."
"23966780","23967760"," I don't know that I believe that."
"23968080","23968820"," I have like. "
"23969620","23971240"," Ten accounts on tasty trade."
"23972380","23973900"," Under my social security."
"23974660","23975200"," It's the same. "
"23975440","23976100"," It's the same account."
"23976980","23980720"," But you can open up more than you can open up like ten cash accounts with them."
"23983980","23985180"," I'm telling you it doesn't. "
"23985700","23989440"," I don't know if I don't know if P.D.T. follows your social security number."
"23990000","23992420"," All I know is that you can have multiple accounts."
"23997800","24000320"," Oh they do they do P.D.T. across all accounts now. "
"24008950","24013310"," I'm going to hold them into the into after hours and see if they if they smash it up higher."
"24021820","24024880"," So cash accounts are not P.D.T. I have no idea."
"24025180","24026340"," I have no idea. "
"24031290","24033210"," Good faith violations of P.D.T. is different."
"24033510","24035270"," I have I'll be honest with you."
"24035350","24035730"," I have no idea. "
"24037610","24040010"," All I know is that you can you can open multiple accounts."
"24042710","24043350"," On tasty."
"24053250","24055170"," Chase is saying that three eighty seven is the short. "
"24055470","24055970"," We can look at that."
"24055970","24056790"," Do you want to see it?"
"24056930","24057890"," Chase and see if it is."
"24061970","24064290"," Chase saying he thinks that the short might be right here. "
"24066650","24067530"," Hold on it will look."
"24078430","24081350"," So Chase is saying that there might be a re short here into the bell."
"24092770","24094290"," Looks like it can at least open up. "
"24094630","24095230"," You know it doesn't."
"24095650","24098350"," So Chase is saying that a one here."
"24102010","24103730"," We still have fifteen minutes to trade this. "
"24105510","24106650"," So Chase is saying."
"24108490","24109910"," Yeah, I think it's a fair bet Chase."
"24110230","24110830"," I like your idea. "
"24111750","24114010"," So Chase is saying that you would see."
"24116430","24117970"," Something like this into Monday."
"24118390","24120730"," So be aware of this if you try to buy calls for Monday. "
"24121490","24125550"," Or it's something like this down into Monday and then you'd actually hit finally hit support."
"24126950","24129830"," This is where real support is on spy just so you know."
"24130370","24134030"," So there could be one more down day ahead here. "
"24135050","24136210"," You guys see that?"
"24140400","24142320"," That's a fair point Chase."
"24142580","24142940"," I see it."
"24143840","24144820"," Good shout out bro. "
"24146960","24148240"," I see it."
"24150380","24152540"," Down, down, down."
"24154200","24155820"," Didn't quite get it there today. "
"24157360","24161820"," And they get it down into Monday open and then that's where the trade is right there."
"24164100","24168260"," That would be a three eighty three to three seventy three."
"24168660","24169660"," That's big, right?"
"24169900","24170700"," That's a hundred point drop. "
"24171120","24172900"," That's a giant trade down."
"24173340","24174840"," I wonder what puts costs."
"24175200","24176340"," Maybe by puts and. "
"24178300","24179260"," Let me go look."
"24195360","24197480"," I forgot about my spy calls too."
"24198320","24200320"," I wasn't looking at them. "
"24200380","24200980"," I was looking at the."
"24202680","24203840"," Hold on here."
"24213850","24217370"," So on the twenty third or the nineteenth right. "
"24221990","24227790"," On the nineteenth three seventy three's P's are eight cents."
"24232360","24234840"," Maybe it take like a three eighty five C."
"24236500","24237500"," And a three."
"24239800","24241880"," Three seventy four P."
"24244380","24245520"," Three seventy four P."
"24245840","24249500"," So you do like a cost like a dollar thirty or dollar forty total. "
"24250160","24253120"," You straddle it or you could do in the money on both sides."
"24254460","24257280"," We pretty pricey though the three eighty three P's for."
"24258260","24262780"," Monday or dollar eighty nine and the three eighty five's are a dollar. "
"24263480","24264560"," That's a pretty big trade."
"24264740","24265680"," That's like four dollar trade."
"24267020","24271320"," On directional directional bias and you'd be trading it for. "
"24271640","24273600"," You'd have to run the numbers on it and see what it pays."
"24274900","24277760"," So you do a three eighty five's or something."
"24278500","24280660"," And just hope for the blast off up here. "
"24281400","24284040"," And you'd be taking this trade right here into Monday."
"24284340","24285080"," Just to straddle."
"24286540","24288800"," I'd probably say it'd be better to do the. "
"24289880","24292320"," The dirt cheap puts down here and then some OTM."
"24292560","24295720"," Maybe some thirty or forty delta calls over here."
"24310800","24313600"," Where everyone has to develop their own strategy that works for them. "
"24314260","24315980"," Most of the people still see your information trade."
