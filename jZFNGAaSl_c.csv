"427720","437340"," Tesla specifically must also produce something that is unknown to market unknown to market nothing"
"437340","444620"," expected nothing that you're looking forward to otherwise you do not get a continuation to the"
"444620","451780"," upside and a squeeze of any kind after hours that is it there is no other discussion and"
"451780","460320"," specifically that has a lot to do to with the run up to 300 otherwise yesterday I even let you"

"492880","504440"," all three they squose now trailed off by 18.9% from one year ago so at four now"
"505810","515789"," with that said now with that said those two large reports every year this"
"515789","524330"," is how it goes you get your first tech reports if your first tech report is outstanding we get"
"524330","532350"," continuation and run up some other tech stocks if the first reports are horrible we get panic and"
"532350","541330"," tech those reports were not horrible but they also were not great so what that does is if you're a"
"541330","547270"," tech bro you should already know this and that would mean that you're going to begin to wrap up"
"547270","557210"," shop you can see that right now in NASDAQ now there's something else for you to look at"
"557210","566150"," here DJI continued higher in the overnight that's showing you a migration"
"566150","574310"," like think of it like a bunch of like bulls running from place to place right they don't always run"
"574310","580110"," stay in the stock market sometimes they run out and they buy houses they buy commercial property"
"580110","586090"," they buy bonds they buy all kinds of shit right but sometimes they go out and they they just put"
"586090","594710"," their money into cash so there's a migration right now you can actually see now with that migration"
"594710","599070"," they haven't migrated from everything you can see it goes told there was excellent liquidity"

"611430","621130"," of a hint i want to show you the hint here in apple that there was no there was no"
"621130","628890"," exit liquidity i want to show you why here even though apple was down a dollar 40 in pre-market"
"628890","637350"," or whatever it was this morning the key for you to see was that the squeeze started right here and"
"637350","645150"," we never went below that squeeze at any point we had a retracement and then it's squeeze higher and"
"645150","652390"," they bought this in the belly yesterday too so this is just accumulation by large banks these guys"
"652390","662270"," want they have not left expectation that this will be spoken about in apple's earnings"
"662270","671130"," so you from from my perspective right now this mass migration out of uh tech"
"671130","678210"," is going to be tech that's been run up into their earnings apple is giving you a key that hey"
"678210","687950"," don't leave us behind we've got some news coming big news now i would exclude apple from this"

"739430","746510"," had a plant lined up and they literally broke the deal when it leaked publicly they're very"
"746510","752990"," sensitive about this stuff leaking i couldn't figure out if they broke the news or if reporters"
"752990","761690"," found out uh so that could be negative down the road here into their earnings apple hates uh public"
"761690","767130"," information before product is ready to launch on their own terms so i'll be fascinated by that they"
"767130","773390"," literally broke when they broke that agreement they shut down car development a second time but"
"773390","778550"," with that said with that news you're not going to see this crash right now i apologize to you it"
"778550","787850"," ain't happening it just doesn't happen this is not tesla this is this is apple so uh apple is still"

"855770","863830"," since december of 2020 we've seen this happen the last thing that was that was glaring was"
"863830","872110"," regional banks we talked about commercial real estate likely being next lo and behold it was"
"872110","880050"," companies like att like verizon they all got taken down to the woodshed there are still some"
"880050","886970"," medical companies that have not been taken out to the woodshed yet we know they're gonna be on deck"

"892790","902770"," there's no fucking way they're not getting biotech is july so maybe we see that happen with those"
"902770","908370"," companies in august we have a peak maybe in those companies then they just start hammering those"
"908370","916310"," next now the question becomes are we in distribution or consolidation right now it just looks like"

"963010","970670"," you here this is a five-minute time frame here i always talk to you about in this show that"
"970670","977110"," you'll get confirmation on larger time frames that when we're trading a five-minute or a one-minute"
"977110","982410"," chart that if we're going to make a leg higher or even a leg lower you get a chance to"
"982410","988730"," get out of your shorts you get a chance to get out of your lungs and to never just panic"

"1040650","1048010"," it's today and they have to in in this closure right as we go into the weekend to monday there"
"1048010","1055090"," should be some kind of a consolidation we're going to talk about consolidation versus distribution"

"1063370","1070130"," a moment for you to learn something here now because this has cost me a lot of money uh and"
"1070130","1077410"," an insurance to trade up as we go along now i've made a lot of money too but you know"
"1077410","1085130"," like it's very been very costly uh and i want you to see it as well so right now you're"

"1475580","1482560"," to get in on this trade does that make sense to it's not like a five-minute trade that's going"
"1482560","1491820"," to last for like for like 15 minutes it's like you got you got a few minutes here before uh"
"1491820","1500460"," all this happens here so you want to see the break you can see the bear flag forming right now"
"1500460","1510240"," in spx or bear plane forming right now in spx right there it's already"
"1510240","1533940"," forewarning either we're going to the downside see it so even if"

"1537260","1542860"," output but if you know if you think this is bad you've got time it'll come right back up here"
"1542860","1549600"," and it'll it'll keep going down you'll have a minute to jump on board this to the downside so spx"
"1549600","1556840"," right now showing a bear of a bear plane or whatever now saying all this right here i want to"
"1556840","1565600"," show you something else uh i want to show you one more thing here so got a nice failure right"

"1587470","1600450"," some weirdness here okay so i want to show you one other thing here one"
"1600450","1610130"," second here to reload all this stuff this is the most important part of"
"1610130","1618090"," our two most important parts of our discussion this morning where we've discussed uh earnings"
"1618090","1626550"," yesterday we've discussed the migration that we can already see into dgia uh the last thing that i"
"1626550","1634230"," want to say though is this this is the important thing it's a critical thing i want to talk to"
"1634230","1643550"," you about here i want to talk to you about time time has been an enemy of bears"
"1643550","1653550"," uh we've taken it's taken time to make significant downside moves in the"
"1653550","1663350"," market and what it that has led to is limiting downside expectations uh you need like sellers need"
"1663350","1671030"," to make progress to the downside the longer that it takes for them to make progress uh all of all"
"1671030","1678890"," this momentum from down below comes back up let me see i'm mute that chat box okay good i want"
"1678890","1683750"," you to be able to see all of this so we're seeing limited moves to the downside the reason i'm"
"1683750","1692170"," bringing that up is because as we make these rolls you see the brakes here break there right watch"
"1692170","1699910"," my cursor break right here another nice break right here but because it's taking so many days to"
"1699910","1708010"," get there look at this this is a break on the sixth check them into the tenth four fucking days"
"1708010","1716870"," with no downside uh action right no tag of the daily trigger no tag of the daily trigger failure"
"1716870","1725030"," for even got to the daily trigger and if you just keep taking days here one two three four five"
"1725030","1733630"," six right you get what i'm saying again you start to have to limit your downside expectations even"
"1733630","1743510"," if you tag the daily trigger so like 450 if it takes four or five days if it took"
"1743510","1751410"," one day yeah you get your 440 you know what i'm saying you get blood really fast it's 440 you"
"1751410","1759330"," take four or five days to get there you can suck it on i'm letting more than 450 you know"
"1759330","1768890"," what i'm saying i'm saying this because as we have rolled all the way up a prime example is the"
"1768890","1778810"," last roll that we took i had 432 peas and i had 420 peas i had 432s see"

"2469940","2474640"," regardless i don't care i don't care what the market's doing you're going to see a reaction here"
"2474640","2480120"," and likely you're going to see it soon this is what i'm saying take the money up spy you might"
"2480120","2485800"," get that extra plunge down but it's risky this is the meat of the trade right here this is just"
"2485800","2490980"," a little bit of extra right here so i was talking yesterday about where i wanted to buy tesla so"
"2490980","2496140"," yesterday i told you i don't know why there's no green bar here uh there was one here yesterday i'm"

"2531420","2539700"," tesla i want you to see something else there there's nothing broken in trend here in tesla someone"
"2539700","2545760"," was asking me yesterday or this morning or not asking me someone was saying that they were they"
"2545760","2553420"," were long the underlying on tesla and i i ranted about this i ranted about this on stream the other"
"2553420","2560040"," day about the kind of bull you want to be what kind of tesla bull do you want to be"
"2560500","2566860"," and i harp on this all the time and i'd no one fucking ever listens to me but do you"
"2566860","2575540"," want to be a tesla buyer like down here like right there okay that's always where you want to be"
"2575540","2582440"," a tesla buyer now trend is still alive on tesla there's no reversal here i don't want to show you"
"2582440","2586760"," something here being a tesla bull now if you're tesla bull i want you to pay attention to me right"
"2586760","2595860"," now okay so let's say we let's say right now we don't know and tesla is going to reverse to"
"2595860","2602860"," the downside let's say there's someone out there in fin to it land or wall street bet land or i"
"2602860","2612160"," don't fucking know barons or some stroker on cnbc some like that right now let's say tesla is going"
"2612160","2619920"," to reverse and let's say you're a buyer of tesla down here okay and let's say trend is going to"
"2619920","2627220"," break let's say some allia wave nerd out there uh he's run out of erasers he's sharpened like"
"2627220","2634300"," fucking 50 pencils and he's like fucking last last chance i'm not erasing nothing it's gonna break"
"2634300","2640880"," and go to the depths of hell it's going to 60 dollars and you and you buy down here right"
"2640880","2650460"," so you're gonna buy down here you are getting a bounce you are you're getting a bounce it's going"
"2650460","2655740"," to bounce up here right and you're going to see this yellow line i'm going to draw this better for"
"2655740","2665180"," you so i'm going to show you what a reversal looks like a full reversal i assure you you're going"
"2665180","2671620"," to get a bounce here okay and then you're going to get a rejection just above it you're going to"
"2671620","2681910"," get what's called a failure it's a failure to make a new high it's right here okay and what"
"2681910","2691410"," will happen will be price will turn around on you basically like that and you're actually going to"
"2691410","2695910"," see this yellow line go vertical down if you don't see the line going vertical down you already"
"2695910","2701790"," know that it's not a reversal i've shown you that previously on spy but i'll show that to you"
"2701790","2706730"," afterwards to give you some some some understanding of that if this yellow line continues up uh"
"2706730","2712030"," when you buy this dip you definitely know that it's not reversing but even if you do and it rolls"
"2712030","2716450"," down on you with the yellow line does and you break below here and now you're like oh shit cap"
"2716450","2725410"," everything sucks i'm upside down right now you're wrong capy something i don't know something like"
"2725410","2735290"," that what you would see would be this line come up here and"
"2735290","2743950"," you'll see this cross of the yellow below uh but you would still see believe it or not one more"
"2745990","2756130"," grasp for a breath of fresh air before you actually get the sell-down in tesla that's"
"2756130","2763570"," actually where your sell-down would be so you're buying down here if you see the yellow line coming"
"2763570","2771130"," down it's giving you for warning and you're still going to get one more uh one more rip or squeeze"
"2771130","2779050"," before the actual roll and the roll in tesla so you have you have some time to figure out um"
"2779050","2787550"," this is where you put what's called risk on in the market now currently you can see the orange line"
"2787550","2793330"," is going up it's not going down the yellow line is going up all signs point to a pullback in"
"2793330","2801190"," tesla i have higher targets five hundred six hundred dollars on tesla right now india have even"
"2801190","2808030"," higher believe it or not on tesla so if you want to be a happy tesla bull right now you"
"2808030","2815910"," are finally having a normalization of tesla you have a break above of daily trigger you have a"
"2815910","2822290"," break above of weekly above monthly that's all positive uh so would i be buying this here at 260"
"2822290","2829210"," luck yeah any minute any time of the day where would i rather buy it down here i can get"
"2829210","2835850"," 230 hell yeah the one last thing that i would tell you would be to expect some kind of"
"2835850","2842470"," consolidation in here maybe a quick drop down to 240 and then you get the rest of your continuation"
"2842470","2849010"," of the upside on tesla so even as time passes you might have this moment here where you're"
"2849010","2854630"," consolidating now if you're like hey cap i don't want to buy down here and have to wait a month"
"2856330","2864190"," if it takes a month to start making its way higher let's say that happens to you i personally don't"
"2864190","2874010"," buy this shit down here i normally don't what i'm looking for is for price to come down right and"
"2874010","2880930"," i'm looking for this i'm looking for price to be above see this green line right here i'm looking"
"2880930","2890810"," for price to get above the green line and confirm that's like"
"2890810","2900520"," spy this morning right and start to make its way up that's when i enter right there okay"
"2900520","2907920"," i don't yeah i'd rather you spend all your money over here showing me the way and then you're like"
"2907920","2913660"," fighting all this and i want to jump on your fucking roller coaster i want to drink your milkshake"
"2913660","2920600"," for the next run higher okay so we're what we're going to be watching in the background we will"
"2920600","2929540"," watch we always watch for price to break above the green line see it right there"
"2929540","2937100"," sells down bounces confirms the green line and boom that's where i'm looking to make some money"
"2937100","2942460"," breaks below the green line breaks above boom that's where i'm making money does that make sense"
"2942460","2952040"," same thing right here right price gets above the green line boom making money make sense so tesla"
"2952040","2958520"," bullish right now likely coming into some consolidation there's another problem here i want to show"
"2958520","2968100"," you with tesla why i think it's going down here to 230 i like buying tesla on the"
"2968100","2976920"," when velocity is down below zero i like it i like minus 25 minus 50 anything like that minus 50"
"2977640","2984000"," fucking sign me up so if we can get bellow down to minus 50 on tesla i'm a fucking buyer"
"2984000","2992140"," okay so i want to see bellow get down on the daily i'm looking for tesla i'm hoping that tesla"
"2992140","2997600"," comes all the way down here and then it'll jump above the the also the hourly and then i can"
"2997600","3004360"," jump on board that train and i'll take that out again okay now at any point between now and next"
"3004360","3017440"," week any point between now and next week let's say price bounces let's"
"3017440","3022620"," say we do get that bounce up here we got a failure here comes back down and begins to hold"
"3024320","3032860"," right i will take that trade right there with you make sense uh you you have a good chance of"
"3032860","3037160"," getting this next week believe it or not some kind of a return of the scene of the crime but"
"3037160","3042360"," i wouldn't bet on it i like betting on this trade right here this is the this is like the"
"3042360","3050100"," low probability and this is the high probability trade on tesla okay so if you're tesselable and"
"3050100","3054560"," you're long the underlying you're sitting on your hands at this point you got nothing to say or do"
"3054560","3059920"," you can't do anything uh if you are long options i don't know what to say to you at this"
"3059920","3065260"," point either hope you have some time on them right now it's saying that we're going up over time"
"3065260","3069620"," but you're going to be waiting and you're going to catch some theta burn could possibly be anywhere"
"3069620","3072720"," from one to three months believe it or not i don't think it's going to be that long but you"
"3072720","3079860"," but i'm saying the long end you might be waiting now if you are along the underlying i don't see"
"3079860","3085820"," any risk here for you at this point if you're trying to be extremely bolt bearish here again you"
"3085820","3093420"," have a price target down below of uh 263 and uh 2 228 for 230 that's called on the downside"
"3093420","3099100"," over here and you probably have two legs down here uh that you can take if you if any point"
"3099100","3105100"," you break below and hold below 265 uh and start trading it let's say they trade this down here you"
"3105100","3113180"," break below one two set up your short uh and execute it right here and then you'll get your your"
"3113180","3118980"," your move down to this 230 right here uh this is the most i'd be expecting for the downside on"
"3118980","3128820"," tassel for a move higher hopefully you sold your short position"
"3128820","3143090"," on spy like i told you on pt2 for the squeeze higher hopefully you took the money and ran uh"
"3143090","3151260"," boy if you if"
"3151260","3169150"," you realize profit down here congratulations woohoo did"
"3169150","3178550"," you take the money and run there let me know if you took me took the money if you're just"
"3178550","3183710"," still fucking full short here maybe your full short here still i guess if you're short you're fine"
"3183710","3193670"," but if you're trading options you got to be tactful get a nice cross down below here with"
"3193670","3201170"," the one minute it's good to see for a bull or for bears this is a good development you want"
"3201170","3209470"," to see this if you're bearish you want to see this cross down just flattening a little bit turning"
"3209470","3214830"," a little bit right here but i'd really like to see it come down stay kind of verticalish you want"
"3214830","3219310"," to see that red line get a little bit more more vicious to the downside we're likely going to come"
"3219310","3225150"," up here and to retest all of this up here at 45 uh 400 so hang tight here if you're"
"3225150","3230330"," trying to if you're trying to get on board here you're likely going to see uh something like that"

"3270440","3283220"," because i'm trying to get through this stuff and stay focused i"
"3283220","3292300"," think i've given you guys uh all the sell this take money and run here they have they have kind"
"3292300","3305590"," of get given you at all at this point so i think this line is pretty crystal clear joey"
"3305590","3310610"," donut saying all my late hug is calls and tickers are looking like limp pickle this morning you"
"3310610","3318210"," know there is something else to say here too uh we've had the highest volume of calls in a very"
"3318210","3324310"," long time i think maybe historically the past couple past week it's a very positive thing for bulls"
"3325090","3332030"," so the dealers will counter that counter that trade and make you buy them buy more of them uh so"
"3332030","3342230"," it's actually a very bullish thing down the road not today but down the road yeah i"
"3342230","3350230"," gotta speak a little bit soft more softly okay so uh we did tesla let's take a look at netflix"
"3350230","3360350"," really quick so i can we can be done with this round of uh of earnings now"
"3360350","3368550"," netflix uh what i wanted to discuss with netflix was uh they did good they didn't actually do so"
"3368550","3378110"," bad um they didn't actually do as bad as uh expected they got five or six million new"
"3378110","3390670"," subscribers i still have concerns about the writer strikes but"
"3390670","3396090"," i think there's a rotation out of it right now so if i had a place to buy netflix not"
"3396090","3405070"," technically bearish on netflix but it's not one of my favorites but i want to discuss this here so"
"3405070","3413430"," netflix maybe buy 380 or at least show some interest 380 and 390 even if you get a bounce trade"
"3413430","3419870"," here it says you'll get a bounce trade here but i don't think that it's going to hold um now"
"3419870","3425850"," the difference what i don't like about netflix versus some of these other companies is this this is"
"3425850","3435190"," a very critical thing to understand companies that have to pay for um raw materials commodities"
"3435190","3445150"," to produce a product are paying less uh now i know netflix pays for production costs and stuff like"
"3445150","3454590"," that and for actors and writers um we've have had some wage growth but um"
"3454590","3464010"," it's not it's not exactly like buying chips or buying raw materials that kind of stuff they don't"
"3464010","3472010"," get as much of a pass as i would give another company that might not yet be paying less prices"
"3472010","3481230"," uh from ppe type materials so if you see companies in this if you see under performers"
"3481230","3490850"," in this er season because i'm expecting what i'm expecting i use this as an an example for eggs"
"3490850","3499030"," so there's a golden there's a golden sweet spot like a a goldilocks zone for these companies where"
"3499030","3509030"," maybe they were they were charging ten dollars for eggs they had a cost of eight dollars so"
"3509030","3515990"," they're only making two bucks as inflation is coming down for these companies and if they're still"
"3515990","3523610"," charging ten dollars but their cost of goods comes down to a dollar or fifty cents believe it or"
"3523610","3529650"," not there's this small window where they're gonna clean up because you're still accepting paying"
"3529650","3537630"," ten dollars for eggs and bring up that example of eggs because i saw eggs for a dollar and then"
"3537630","3543350"," this week at a competitor i saw them for two dollars but there was a window in this last quarter"
"3543350","3552710"," where uh likely their cost came down and there was nobody was competing yet to drop inflation they"
"3552710","3561250"," were just hand over fisting profit so their cost had come down to produce they didn't change their"
"3561250","3567230"," price they waited for other competitors to start to come in and drop their pricing so there is this"
"3567230","3574270"," small window but there should be a window here in some of these reports in q3 and if we don't"
"3574270","3580610"," see them here in some companies you may see them in q4 where like eggs maybe are coming down but"
"3580610","3589630"," cars are not as an example but Netflix really doesn't have an excuse is my point here so for me"
"3589630","3596950"," price target down below and Netflix uh 380 and i think they get a rotation out um and they have"
"3596950","3604770"," some they have some bad shit to look forward to down here now if price trades up i'll follow price"
"3604770","3610530"," above that hourly trigger but otherwise i'm not interested it's one of those companies that have"
"3610530","3623480"," zero interest in there's no fucking reason for them not to beat across the board right now none so"
"3623480","3632800"," that's Netflix out of the way for you here is your hourly trigger here is uh your uh 27 ema"
"3632800","3640400"," here's your 119 if you are looking for another short if you're bearish your short believe it or not"
"3640400","3649860"," is right here 454 46 is where the smart money is shorting if you're a little bit more aggressive"
"3649860","3659850"," and then you're going to DCA in you're right now here you are right here just write that in"
"3659850","3673660"," there um i don't"
"3673660","3683150"," know how i spelled that wrong i can't read it from here aggressive seller smart seller"
"3683150","3694950"," see it right there you"
"3694950","3702150"," know what this is right here right this is the death zone this is the gambling zone in here right"
"3704010","3712430"," it's the no fuck around zone right here don't ever get in a trade in here you can let's say"
"3712430","3719250"," buy puts here and DCA puts right here you can hold hold your hands here and miss the trade down"
"3719250","3728110"," here but you can buy them if there's a squeeze up here makes sense your stops would be up here"
"3731990","3755610"," whatever you do never fuck around in here okay is"
"3755610","3762770"," there any chance that this reverse is higher uh it doesn't matter if it does it that so that's a"
"3762770","3767910"," good question so nino's saying is there any chance that this reverse is higher it doesn't matter if"
"3767910","3773730"," it does uh if so if you're a trader you took this trade here you took your money and you"
"3773730","3783450"," ran right you're looking for your next entry that would be right here or right here right so let's"

"3819670","3826710"," you might win it even on a bad entry uh three out of four times or two three out of"
"3826710","3833070"," ten times but you need to put the risk on and time your trades appropriately so i'm going to tell"
"3833070","3839110"," you where the rest of the sellers are they're right here and they're right here and i'm going to"

"3913410","3928010"," see that failure oh shit here's our smart seller oh shit him upside down you'll get a failure what"
"3928010","3934550"," does a smart seller do he gets out of his short and then there's the actual move higher right there"
"3935150","3944430"," you see how that smart seller here he is positioned properly he's then in the money"
"3944430","3954230"," it goes against the trade goes against him and he still has the chance to unfuck"
"3954230","3964010"," himself or for minimal damage do you understand what i'm saying here this is this is a professional"
"3964010","3970230"," trader right here even if you're a retailer that's professional trends professional seller right"
"3970230","3979790"," there you understand my point now if you're an aggressive trader right here it's the same trade"
"3979790","3989310"," you're just entering early if it goes against you instead of losing i don't know 10 percent or a"
"3989310","3996570"," dollar or not the dollar 10 percent one percent a penny three pennies you might lose five pennies"
"3997430","4005610"," but you're DCAing so at some point you're going to be cost cost basis even limiting that five"
"4005610","4010170"," pennies they'll go down to like two or three pennies if you get aggressive right in here you"
"4010170","4017630"," understand now let's say that thing does go let's say let's say you DCA you buy here right goes"

"4024090","4031230"," here right and now you DCAed starts to go against you right what happens to you you sell lose a"
"4031230","4038570"," bunch of money comes back down here this is actually where you should have sold right and as it"

"4064770","4069190"," lost two or three pennies trades going against you you can already see that you're going to get"
"4069190","4077950"," closed out it goes up comes back down retests the 27 EMA and there's your long right there so if"
"4077950","4084810"," you were selling you're now buying the market right there does that make sense you guys understand"
"4084810","4094790"," there should be no question ever and this works all of this works on every time frame works on an"
"4094790","4102149"," hour works on a day works on a fucking 15 minute who works on a half hour it doesn't matter"

"4222210","4232190"," shitty way to write it it's not actually how it looks now there are things to look out"
"4232190","4248410"," of the lines flattening out if they're aggressively to the downside that kind of stuff but let's"

"4580550","4588330"," 1170 you have a target above that of 13 dollars then I expect some resistance but then your target"
"4588330","4597150"," above that is uh 1670 then you get another target above that of 20 bucks all of the any any"
"4597150","4604590"," pullbacks on any of those energy producer stocks they're outstanding uh it's still squeezing right"
"4604590","4614570"," now agl energy should continue to squeeze agl energy we we have a few of these energy stocks uh"

"4645330","4659410"," right so we we actually charted this one XRT it's"
"4659410","4665730"," very volatile but this one is worth looking at right here I like this one to at least look at"
"4668230","4680920"," um very volatile right now we're going to look at XRT next uh"
"4680920","4692220"," this one's very dangerous uh but worth a look right now where we are this"
"4692220","4697800"," is a this was showing aggressive bearishness it is what you can see the channels are too right"
"4698820","4708260"," showing aggressive aggressive like rejection to the downside there is some"
"4708260","4719950"," positivity in here showing up right here there's some contra some"
"4719950","4728750"," some contra-ness to this this uh bearishness so although I will say this um I don't know that it"
"4728750","4735250"," I don't know that it actually I think it's still going to do something like this and then you're"
"4735250","4745170"," going to actually get your move and it could possibly even be could possibly even be like"
"4745170","4755830"," a one more fake out maybe of some kind maybe one more fake out not guaranteed here uh"
"4755830","4763150"," the reason I'm saying that is because bellows a little bit long in the tooth uh so maybe you might"
"4763150","4772650"," get just one more failure here so uh but even with that said even with that said um if price"
"4772650","4782450"," were to hold this is squeezing right now by the way uh even if this squeezes up you want to"
"4782450","4789210"," see that successful retest right there uh so if you're gonna if you're gonna take this trade right"
"4789210","4796070"," now right where it's at uh as long as it holds 66.95 as long as it holds that just"
"4796070","4805110"," stops underneath it uh it's it's getting bullish uh blood volatile at the same time and what's"
"4805110","4816590"," really kind of sexy about this one is it's got some nice targets to the upside 76"
"4816590","4825930"," and we've already we've already ground through these sellers here this band with this and this so"
"4825930","4834230"," my price target currently is not this it's actually up here price target eight nine dollars it's a"

"5794110","5799530"," Like how do you not buy TGT or like just stupidity not to."
"5801090","5803110"," It's like it's like the perfect setup."
"5803950","5805270"," It couldn't look any better. "
"5807810","5811810"," Like even where like even where like AT&T hasn't shown you anything yet."
"5812410","5816230"," TGT has done all the work but it's done all the work is done."
"5818230","5822290"," Like AT&T is like hella dangerous hella dangerous. "

"5837530","5838970"," What's going on Sellers."
"5841650","5843970"," Uh oh getting a little squeezy here."
"5845850","5848410"," Aggressive Sellers getting overrun right now. "
"5849210","5850510"," They're sweating here."
"5850670","5851170"," They're sweating."
"5852710","5856010"," They're gonna have the DCA up here like the smart Sellers. "
"5860750","5862830"," They're sweating."
"5862830","5864410"," What do you what can you see here."
"5864530","5865930"," I want to show you guys something. "
"5867530","5868550"," I want to show you guys."
"5868690","5873110"," So if you're an aggressive seller up here what happened over here."
"5873170","5873810"," You want to see it. "
"5875110","5877590"," So you originally sold this right here right."
"5879630","5881430"," What did you want to see."
"5882770","5883950"," What did you want. "
"5885470","5887550"," We talk about this with time right."
"5888750","5890750"," You want to see a new low right."
"5894410","5899210"," Did you fail to get your new low right on this bar right here. "
"5899310","5899590"," You did."
"5902110","5903670"," So what are they doing right now."
"5903750","5904930"," So you're short right here. "
"5905970","5907610"," You started right here right."
"5908490","5915650"," Squeezed up took the short failed failed to get the new fucking low."
"5915970","5917550"," So what are they gonna do to you now. "
"5918670","5922210"," They're gonna check and make sure you're still here."
"5924730","5927730"," They want to know that you're still short."
"5930930","5931870"," Don't they. "
"5932730","5933890"," You failed."
"5936050","5936770"," Loser."
"5939970","5943430"," You failed to get the new low to stay alive. "
"5943890","5951890"," You didn't need to go so they're gonna come up now and check your ass."
"5964530","5965710"," Now I want to show you."
"5966390","5968650"," I was talking yesterday. "
"5969210","5972330"," I want to talk if you're long on."
"5972650","5978050"," If you were long on AT&T."
"5983970","5988390"," If you bought the dip on AT&T you heard saw me talk about it right. "
"5989190","5991050"," Someone asked me what do you think about a cap."
"5992710","5996270"," And I said I'm looking for at least the half back trade."
"5997490","6001550"," At least the half back trade right. "
"6003150","6004650"," There it is the downside."
"6005950","6008330"," You get the half back trade boom right there."
"6010290","6012850"," This can continue down. "
"6016130","6021630"," I said I'm looking for nine to ten dollars."
"6031130","6033690"," This is no TGT is it."
"6037950","6040170"," Now can it become a TGT. "
"6040670","6042430"," Yeah can it start to make a turn here."
"6043170","6043430"," Yes."
"6045210","6054790"," But this one's really early is my point. "
"6055430","6055610"," So."
"6068180","6073020"," There's a difference in TGT and ATT as well."
"6074920","6080460"," TGT or ATT is like Tyson Foods. "
"6084890","6086270"," It's like Budweiser."
"6087690","6090430"," You're gonna come up there you're gonna do all that kind of stuff."
"6090470","6094190"," You're eventually come up here and this is likely this looks like it's December. "
"6094710","6097030"," This is more like next year."
"6098710","6099610"," So."
"6100610","6104390"," If you're buying like Budweiser Tyson Foods. "
"6105630","6106510"," Verizon."
"6107490","6110070"," These are like one to three year trades."
"6111070","6112690"," TGT will trade faster. "
"6113930","6119890"," But like a fucking AT&T is gonna be like watching paint dry."
"6120970","6125930"," So what you're gonna do in that trade is you're gonna sell puts below outside the money and then"
"6125930","6126810"," when you go up a little bit."
"6127550","6132830"," You trade up here to twenty bucks you're gonna be selling calls above and you're gonna you're gonna"
"6132830","6133470"," manage this. "
"6133690","6134550"," You're gonna hold this."
"6135110","6139890"," You're gonna buy and hold DCA nine to thirteen dollars."
"6140970","6144690"," Accumulate three to five hundred shares maybe a thousand shares. "
"6145770","6150330"," And then you're just gonna go out there and you're gonna sell OTM puts on the lows and OTM calls"
"6150330","6151030"," in the highs."
"6151790","6154210"," And you're gonna run this thing up for like three years."
"6155070","6156030"," Long term holding. "
"6156810","6157950"," Definitely no TGT."
"6158490","6159830"," Not the same ticker."
"6160730","6162690"," This is like going in Clorox bleach. "
"6165210","6166990"," It ain't going nowhere."
"6171010","6172770"," It's like Tyson Foods."
"6173010","6175610"," They're always gonna be frying some shit up for some kids somewhere. "
"6176650","6182570"," Is someone's always gonna be drinking a Budweiser or a related owned product from Budweiser?"
"6185810","6188870"," Yeah but this isn't hasn't turned yet has it."
"6191050","6192510"," Just be wary of this."
"6193770","6195930"," There you got your half back trade. "
"6196490","6201070"," That is my only expectation on T on on this on this ticker."
"6201370","6202570"," I want to warn you of that."
"6203370","6206130"," So if you get another chance to buy down below some leaps. "
"6206750","6208570"," You want to synthetically own it with leaps."
"6209790","6211810"," I'd be getting them as far out as possible."
"6212770","6216890"," Like whatever the last fucking contract is or if you're buying the underlying. "
"6217710","6219190"," You're not adding here."
"6219370","6222370"," You're looking for another dip to buy down below at this point."
"6223910","6226150"," So if you can buy at twelve fifty do it. "
"6226830","6228050"," If it breaks above."
"6229110","6231230"," If you break above fifteen dollars."
"6231950","6235710"," Next target above that would be sixteen twenty five. "
"6240390","6241790"," Above sixteen fifty."
"6242550","6247530"," I'd be looking for a price target of eighteen dollars on T ATT."
"6249270","6252710"," So now we're having a discussion about long term holding right. "
"6253350","6257330"," These are discussions about long term holdings like one to three years."
"6257330","6261610"," Oh what happened there."
"6264710","6266670"," Squeezed out right there huh. "
"6270950","6273070"," What bar gave it away."
"6275190","6276170"," Do you know?"
"6276850","6277930"," Talked about it didn't we."
"6279960","6281770"," This bar right here gave it away. "
"6284960","6286740"," That bar right there."
"6287660","6289880"," You didn't need to go to the depths of hell."
"6289900","6294080"," You just needed a new low. "
"6296580","6299860"," You needed this to be a big red fat bar right here."
"6301640","6303320"," That was the telltale sign."
"6306500","6308840"," This could have also been a red bar. "
"6310520","6312620"," And then this one be a red bar."
"6313460","6316140"," Then this one be your third red bar."
"6318220","6321080"," Maybe it was this bar was the telltale sign I guess. "
"6321300","6322860"," This would be the bigger sign right here."
"6326320","6326900"," Overrun."
"6328240","6331540"," What is this now telling you right. "
"6332480","6335100"," These sellers here failed."
"6336860","6340380"," You're now going to go up and check these sellers right here."
"6343060","6343660"," Right. "
"6343660","6346440"," We're going to find out if these guys are strong."
"6347220","6350280"," If these guys aren't strong if these sellers are weak."
"6353180","6355680"," What is this going to tell us. "
"6356260","6359080"," So if we get a green bar that closes above."
"6361560","6362460"," Right there."
"6362720","6363720"," What is that telling you. "
"6370140","6372020"," All right so you come up and test this."
"6372660","6374160"," You're going to get a bar down here."
"6377260","6379620"," If we catch a green bar up here. "
"6380600","6383000"," You will then get this bar right there."
"6383000","6384500"," Then you're going to get a red bar."
"6386540","6387420"," Right there. "
"6388120","6389920"," Then these buyers are going to come up."
"6407470","6409870"," And these buyers are going to come right here."
"6410770","6412970"," They're going to run these smart sellers over. "
"6413930","6415730"," You're going to fail that right there."
"6418730","6420070"," But it's not going to matter."
"6425920","6430080"," Because these buyers right here is where your 80 percent trade is. "
"6430460","6432720"," It's actually going to come back down and it's going to go like that."
"6433520","6434620"," Get all that right there."
"6435640","6437620"," That is a big trade right there. "
"6437740","6440280"," That one right there is going to rip some faces off."
"6442460","6443740"," Rip faces off."
"6459980","6461540"," You might actually get it before. "
"6461800","6462880"," Look how they're already losing it."
"6462880","6464380"," They're going to panic right here."
"6465200","6466000"," Look at that. "
"6466200","6468800"," They're already losing the fucking trade on the second bar."
"6469720","6471100"," Sellers are weak right now."
"6471260","6471600"," Heads up. "
"6474500","6476560"," Sellers are weak even right here in this bar."
"6477020","6478240"," Sellers are fucking weak."
"6483660","6484940"," Weak ass seller. "
"6487830","6488960"," You can see it already."
"6507040","6508820"," It's about to get squosin."
"6509900","6516930"," It's because you know why he's weak right. "
"6517770","6518830"," Because we need to distribute."
"6519150","6521410"," We're fucking consolidating."
"6524610","6525710"," Weak ass seller. "
"6537660","6539540"," Okay yeah we're getting one aren't we."
"6540040","6541200"," You see it up."

"7138740","7142500"," I read something else the past couple weeks they were talking about rebalancing. "
"7143380","7144660"," I think there's a rebalancing."
"7145360","7149100"," I know that Nasdaq 100 is going through balance as well."
"7149720","7151620"," Uh like that's unknown. "
"7153220","7157740"," I do know that people are like uh Chamath can suck my balls."
"7159900","7161320"," Chamath can suck my balls."
"7162040","7168380"," I read what he had to say about it about how it's going to disrupt Nasdaq 100. "
"7168880","7171800"," I'm assuming he was looking at 2011 or whatever."
"7172940","7177600"," But the market was already going down so he can blow me on that one."
"7178500","7188260"," Uh we had a rebalance in 1998 when the stock market was going up and it did not disrupt the"
"7188260","7189220"," Nasdaq 100. "
"7191360","7198920"," So the two previous instances of a rebalancing the stock market did not go down both times."
"7199680","7206080"," Uh so that's bullshit that's like claiming the twos and tens matter which they don't."
"7214160","7215860"," So I don't know. "
"7216200","7218380"," I mean like the rebalancing doesn't mean shit."
"7218600","7219420"," I want you to know that."
"7219920","7229320"," Uh the Nasdaq 100 rebalance historically there is no correlation between like cues going down"
"7229320","7230780"," because of the rebalancing. "
"7231260","7237300"," We have an example of it going down or the market going down while we were rebalancing."
"7238130","7243320"," We have another example of the market going up during a rebalancing and guess what happened?"
"7243900","7247100"," The Nasdaq fucking 100 followed the market."
"7248960","7256300"," There isn't like three old guys that are like yeah we're going to dump Nasdaq while the market's"
"7256300","7256860"," going up. "
"7257400","7259080"," Chamath is out of his fucking mind."
"7260060","7261540"," Probably just wants to buy a dip."

"7284250","7285310"," Not all of them."
"7286450","7287830"," I actually like Mike Wilson."
"7288350","7291470"," Tom Lee was like uh don't give Mike Wilson shit. "
"7293470","7297050"," Well I actually like Mike Wilson and uh he didn't say the reasons."
"7298530","7304270"," He didn't say the reasons in his post but we had just talked about Mike Wilson like two weeks ago"
"7304270","7304750"," in the show."
"7305830","7312510"," I had shown you uh why Mike Wilson had given a target of 3200. "
"7314150","7316790"," Why he gave a target of 2,800 then 3,200."
"7317510","7319230"," He was showing you what we see."
"7321110","7325630"," So when he was in like October, September, October, then December, he was correct. "
"7326670","7328330"," That was the downside risk."
"7329050","7330870"," So he was actually telling you the truth."
"7332150","7333030"," So I like Wilson. "
"7333290","7334350"," I'm actually a fan of Mike Wilson."
"7334570","7335810"," I know you guys paid him."
"7335890","7341350"," I make fun of him too but he's not lying. "
"7342450","7344070"," I'll very preface that."
"7344070","7352210"," Uh we're like MS or JPM will if you're an investor with these guys they'll give you the actual uh"
"7352210","7353730"," white papers on to what to do."
"7353810","7355190"," They'll be like do this, do that, do this. "
"7356110","7359890"," But then they have like a mouthpiece like Mike Wilson that'll be like hey and this is your risk."
"7360050","7360670"," He'll say that publicly."
"7368390","7371090"," Surely expecting the Freddie Mac mortgage rate statistics. "
"7373570","7375250"," What else we got to look at this morning."
"7380270","7390150"," It says Netflix signs up 1.5 million US subscribers but I thought it was 3 to"
"7390150","7391290"," 3.5 million."
"7391650","7395930"," So that looks like it's uh inaccurate unless I got the wrong information. "
"7410040","7412380"," WTI crude oil prices or race gains."
"7413220","7415880"," I'm not a fan of crude but I am a fan of the companies."
"7415880","7424080"," Uh like the pumping companies, the transport companies, the well companies, all those kind of"
"7424080","7424440"," companies. "
"7434240","7439560"," And it also says here markets consolidate around odds of one last hike."
"7440160","7442760"," Uh odds of a 25 base point rate."
"7442960","7444960"," I don't think we're consolidating for a rate hike maybe. "
"7445520","7452760"," We are seeing some um some rotation into uh rates in sensitive stocks right now."
"7452760","7454600"," So I can I can I can get with that."
"7456000","7457040"," I can get with that. "
"7459300","7463680"," I am fascinated by the uh statement itself."
"7464080","7472140"," Statement is uh markets consolidate around odds of one last rate hike."
"7472140","7481720"," Uh 25 basis point uh rate increase next week reaches 99.8% of the CME's"
"7481720","7483020"," FedWatch tool. "
"7484460","7490880"," I personally think that you're going to- Freddie Mac says the 15 year fixed rates mortgage average"
"7490880","7498140"," 6.0, 6% as of July 20th and the US 30 year fixed rate mortgage average 6.7, 8 "
"7498140","7501160","% for July 20th versus 6.9, 6%."
"7501160","7510870"," That's why we- I do think that you're going to get uh in my view you're going to get"
"7510870","7518130"," your 25 BPS and you are going to be told uh that you expect more rate increases."
"7527890","7531950"," Now I am going to warn you of something else here. "
"7531950","7533410"," We're going to talk about this right now."
"7536270","7547690"," So Nick Temeros in the last rate increase said they couldn't announce a pause in"
"7547690","7548530"," their last meeting."
"7549490","7560370"," So if they do give you a 25 BPS and at any point they"
"7560370","7566290"," are they're set up to announce a pause like you'll get your 25 and you'll get a pause like it'll"
"7566290","7576330"," be said 25 BPS and a pause if you get that pause that"
"7576330","7586310"," is going to signal if you get that that verbiage 25 BPS and a pause not like uh 25 BPS"
"7586310","7595850"," and we'll we'll look at the data if you get like pause that's going to signal late bull cycle to"
"7595850","7604570"," you um and I would be looking at this bull run to end"
"7604570","7607110"," within three to six months. "
"7609780","7618790"," If he continues to threaten he doesn't say pause or if he says uh data dependence"
"7618790","7621710"," we're still bull run."
"7625380","7631320"," This would be like a like a third if we're at the last where the last third if he says"
"7631320","7641220"," pause and then when they say rate cuts you'll likely see that"
"7641220","7645080"," actual liquidity grab to sell the market."
"7646100","7652700"," You'll see an initial reaction higher uh like a like a mad dash to the finish line and then you"
"7652700","7659120"," should see the market roll over uh and we will go back down into the trough and uh set a"
"7659120","7668900"," low when we're beginning to cut rates you're going to expect a bull run that's not going to happen"
"7668900","7677460"," the bull run already happened they're going to roll this market right and you're going to sell"
"7677460","7683840"," right into you you're going to see a big squeeze in the market and then it's going to fucking roll"
"7683840","7689660"," and they usually front run it too this is the other part we at some point we have to discuss"
"7689660","7698580"," like we're not there yet but we have to discuss like once the pause is given there's usually like"
"7698580","7708680"," uh so like let's say you guys ready to squeeze these fucking bears out so"
"7708680","7718500"," so let's say we've got uh the pause bam 25 bps drawn it on here for you right"
"7719270","7727320"," you get to pause right and let's say let's say uh market makers let's say banks hedge funds"
"7729000","7738020"," speculators uh they're going to give this like three and six months you should"
"7738020","7747960"," see so this is say bam 25 bps with a pause the market should go up for"
"7747960","7755680"," the next three months but as we get closer to this the wrong timeline hold on here for the wrong"
"7755680","7766510"," kind of a chart to be drawn oh"
"7766510","7775270"," oh yes squeeze them out baby hold on hold on hold on hold on put that back there weak ass"
"7775270","7785010"," sellers so 25 bps right and a"
"7785010","7797080"," pause that's like three months right there here's"
"7797080","7806460"," another there's your six months is in here okay the market pan still go up here believe it or not"
"7806460","7812660"," because they're gonna whore this shit out but if you at any point see like a mad dash to the"
"7812660","7822540"," upside before we get to the six month mark if you at any point see this if we continue like"
"7822540","7829520"," this and then you see a mad dash here wherever that happens this is going to be a front running"
"7829520","7837480"," to anticipation of rake cuts they're going to blast this shit down to the depths of hell"
"7837480","7847180"," and you'll likely see rake cuts uh if they can if they can you'll see like now this is very"
"7847180","7852800"," so i want you guys to know that in uh 2019 we were gonna crash anyways we're we're heading towards"
"7852800","7858820"," this anyways uh and we're we're we're coming into that right now we're not there right now but"
"7858820","7867120"," we're coming into it uh this rate increase will matter weak ass sellers get ready to get fucking"
"7867120","7874200"," your faces ripped off ripped off here it comes we'll cross three trigger cluster right now"
"7874200","7883710"," happening if you're a"
"7883710","7908010"," seller get the fuck out of the way uh so think"
"7908010","7913490"," about this as we come into the ray type i want you to chew on this i want you to"
"7913490","7919290"," like stop listening to fucking people on fucking fin to it and i want you to start thinking about"
"7919290","7926650"," that going to think about the language that is used from chair pao i want you to go back and"
"7926650","7933370"," look at what nik tamaro said in the last rate increase and i'm going to tell you right now that"
"7933370","7942210"," the language has slowly been changing every rate increase they're changing the language in the"
"7942930","7950670"," press releases to the public i don't care what he's saying when he's talking when he's talking he's"
"7950670","7960270"," trying to talk the market down or up when he releases that paper that language has been changing"
"7961590","7967310"," and we're pro and when you when we get the next change in language it really is going to make"
"7967310","7973270"," a difference because it's starting to get close to it's not late cycle it's like that we're about"
"7973270","7982830"," six months away uh when when that language if we if we get that 25 bps and pause language not"
"7982830","7990610"," data dependence pause now i personally my personal take here is you're not getting that pause"
"7990610","7996430"," language i think he's going to maintain where he said the last time he's going to give you 25 bps"
"7996990","8005030"," it is going to tell you that it's data dependent and we might miss one more rate cycle increase so"
"8005030","8010450"," it's very similar right we're going to skip the next cycle and review it again that's going to"
"8010450","8017090"," extend the bull market in my view that turns it into believe it or not nine months of bull run"
"8017090","8026730"," ahead that's nine months but if he comes in and says anything like oh yeah here's your 25 bps we're"
"8026730","8036290"," pausing you likely have six months of bull run left so that could put you in in december if he"
"8036290","8041870"," if he gives you the i'm telling you if he gives you the 25 bps and we'll data dependent look"
"8041870","8048610"," at it in a couple months we'll skip this cycle you will get nine months out of this bull run"
"8049130","8060010"," that'll put you into march look at them weak ass sellers in there get"
"8060010","8068190"," on up there do the thing now i want you to trade PT1 up here when you get up there"
"8068190","8075550"," and i want you to want you to squeeze every one of these motherfuckers out of there that's right we"

"8241360","8249059"," right about a year yeah our spy was a year and we traded for 40 the year before that right"
"8251459","8257520"," so they traded this market sideways as they mowed all these sectors down and this guy's like this"
"8257520","8263660"," is the top we're getting a market crash and i'm like whoa whoa whoa this fucking market goes up"
"8263660","8272540"," it's been going up since fucking the 1800s so anytime you take this side of this market sideways or"

"8324430","8334330"," haven't been trading for 60 for the past 20 years for 30 years or 100 years so"
"8336730","8344030"," you knock this market down and once we get back to our previous high you just think that's what"

"9450190","9456730"," need those things along with the tens and twos to make it valid and when you don't have those"
"9456730","9481190"," things it doesn't prove anything so you don't have it right now yeah"
"9481190","9502110"," there's nothing surprising about this at all as they're done i agree with you man nice"

"9726660","9736570"," there there had to lead it all for now is there any chart out there that that looks bearish to"
"9736570","9746390"," you i guess this one kind of does we haven't even tested though one two three one two"
"9746390","9752670"," three four or we're getting there we're close for not quite there yet are we what else is unique"
"9752670","9759570"," about this do you know do you know else is unique about this we haven't even tested a high yet"
"9759570","9765290"," look at this one haven't even tested i haven't even tested a high haven't even tested a high"
"9765290","9771350"," haven't even tested i so you got him saying so like yeah we're at least going to get up there"
"9771350","9777730"," and test that high at minimum then we have a high likelihood of going higher and this is a lot"
"9777730","9785070"," of time right here being down isn't it it's a lot of time passing there so that the chances of"
"9785070","9791030"," us going up pretty fucking good even historically looking back in time we have a we have a high"
"9791030","9799650"," probability of touching the the previous eye we haven't even we haven't we have a we have a very"
"9799650","9806270"," high possibility of touching the previous eye we have like an 85% chance of touching the previous"
"9806270","9816010"," eye we have like a 60% chance of trading above the previous eye we don't"
"9816010","9825810"," fail the previous high doesn't happen fucking crazy ooh nice bloodbath there"
"9825810","9832870"," and there's a cross here in the one minute just heads up uh this actually could be a nice leg"
"9832870","9841530"," down might take some puts here uh the put buyers switch to the call side that's never a good idea"
"9842270","9850350"," uh this looks it's actually bearish not bush so right in here whenever i see the double right here"
"9850350","9860830"," never good um so we've got PT2 they tagged that one I'm gonna get some puts here hold on they"
"9860830","9871710"," got the PT2 um i'm gonna have to grab one of these hold on here PT3"
"9874230","9889910"," right down there what"
"9889910","9899570"," is that 4.5174 damn 4.51s are only five cents they're claiming no be care uh"
"9899570","9908810"," don't be short right here we're likely gonna get a squeeze up here oh you know what i'm not bearish"
"9908810","9915650"," here it's a really weird place um we might trade this sideways the rest of today i'm gonna tell you"
"9915650","9924830"," why i'm looking at uh 4.51s okay so our next target is don't don't take a trade right now"
"9924830","9933950"," so our next target is uh 4.51s 74 and 4.51s are only four cents"
"9933950","9943790"," 4.52s are 12 cents point 12 cents for this target um i'm finding that odd"
"9943790","9950690"," they should be at least 20 cents there's a deal of telling you we're not going down there um and"
"9950690","9956670"," i just watched another group of call uh put buyers jump in the market so this is unusual i'm"
"9956670","9962110"," watching some very unusual activity in the options chain i'm watching algorithms jump in on the put"
"9962110","9969010"," and call side on a very high rate right now they're jumping in with like 300 000 puts 300 000"
"9969010","9976230"," calls then closing them um so that this isn't priced in right now is this going down there and i'm"
"9976230","9983510"," watching some really fast action unusual i haven't watched i haven't seen this in um maybe two"
"9983510","9990870"," months what's going on the options chain right now normally they'll take one side and hold it all"
"9990870","9997430"," day long so i'm a little concerned here with uh the minute whatever manipulation is going on in"
"9997430","10004350"," here right now this could be dealers trying to kill options uh secretly inside the chain right now"
"10004350","10012670"," i don't think this is uh hft's i think this is dealers fucking around in here um which they say"
"10012670","10020390"," they don't but i think they are it's very unusual um what i'm what i'm looking at right now now"
"10020390","10027010"," uh normal circumstances i would say this is extremely bearish you get your first one right here you"
"10027010","10036270"," get your second one right here it should happen uh"
"10036270","10045330"," but i'm watching them right now jump in and out of the options chain it's pissing me off um i"
"10045330","10054990"," have a feeling you're going to trade this sideways you're going to do this all day long not a"
"10054990","10059010"," feeling it's it's from uh just looking at the chain i think they're in i think they're fucking"
"10059010","10069700"," around right now no"
"10069700","10081090"," it's not just watching the chain when they come into the chain yeah"

"10087430","10097170"," you guys may or may not know this so when we come into an event like a fed"
"10097170","10106570"," uh meeting or we come into uh an earnings day with an emotional stock"
"10109430","10119330"," Netflix Tesla uh dealer well liquidity providers open up calls and"
"10119330","10127070"," puts for you to buy uh so dealers are going outside of the market and looking for these providers"
"10127070","10133970"," to open liquidity to you dealers are trying to price in and up and down move on the volatility"

"14058810","14067190"," that doesn't mean tesla doesn't roll back over into next week i'm just thinking about the options"
"14067190","14072810"," market like goes somewhere up here and then you get your continuation down into next week something"
"14072810","14082430"," like this so i'm long calls on tesla and i'm not fucking selling and i'm"
"14082430","14099440"," basing this on um panic selling point i'm basing this on dealers so we'll see you"
"14099440","14112110"," heard my uh my case here so you hear my thesis uh"
"14112110","14116170"," yeah so if you think you're gonna see red on uh if you think you're gonna see well you're gonna"
"14116170","14120810"," see like a pinning you'll see like there's a couple things to this uh with you're gonna see a"
"14120810","14127650"," couple things you're gonna see a squeeze into the rate hike you're gonna then see a hedge into the"
"14127650","14133890"," rate hike give it any point during the rate hike the verbiage in the press release changes to 25"
"14133890","14143810"," vps in a pause we're fucking mooning we're gonna fucking moon if you see uh rate hike 25 vps and"
"14143810","14151870"," data dependent you'll probably see the dealers kill the market um if you see 25 vps with a"
"14151870","14161620"," guarantee guaranteed another rate hike we will bloodbath it down made some shitty ones"
"14161620","14167860"," i felt like i should have taken 280s because there was a zero on it but i think i might"
"14167860","14175700"," need to reposition but i might need to buy the uh 280 c and not the 250 uh i've got"
"14175700","14184600"," 282 fives i don't like fucking those half options so we'll see i might have picked the wrong strike"
"14184600","14204790"," by one strike i'm being a little aggressive with the squeeze up here we'll see yeah"
"14204790","14208450"," i think i'd need to be on a zero Joe or maybe slightly more than money what's up there buddy"
"14208450","14215110"," i just got goose by my dog i just don't want to put a dollar down on them let's see"
"14215110","14222550"," about the 275s too if we don't get a fast squeeze up into this bell i might have to reposition"
"14223310","14229230"," if they trade us like sideways or something they do any of this nonsense right here i'll close them"
"14229230","14236850"," out and then i'll get a something more in the money for tomorrow for that right there i want to"
"14236850","14243290"," see if it my thought process here is that there'll be like a hedge fund in here and what'll happen"
"14243290","14260280"," is you'll see it like rocket ship up yeah"
"14260280","14266000"," the 275s or the matter of fact somebody just bought them so if someone's listening to me out there"
"14266000","14274420"," so someone just bought 148 000 275 c's just now in tesla that seems like the sweet spot you know"
"14274420","14284350"," what hold on a second here i'm going to try to break even on these i'm"
"14284350","14304380"," down one penny right now i think i bought 40 cents hold on a second here no i"
"14304380","14313880"," bought 41 cents so they're asking me to pay a penny to take the trade"
"14313880","14337970"," or to dump the trade and then move my move my positioning thanks i dare all"
"14337970","14345590"," right i've got a sell order in for 41 on uh 282 50 i'm going to put a buy order"
"14345590","14353950"," in on um second at least break even i'm going to put a buy order in on 275 c i"
"14353950","14366590"," was thinking of this earlier i'm like mmm i'm like fucking easy they're stuck easy it's"
"14366590","14377220"," fucking five fifty six hundred dollars price i'm"
"14377220","14388770"," going to be shifting over to 275s my"
"14388770","14392950"," other thought here would be to just add the underlying and hold it until we get up there too but"
"14392950","14402910"," it's not a lot of money well how much puts the percentage on that another idea here"
"14402910","14412190"," too is buy like a hundred shares and uh you'll make a pretty decent profit of five percent"
"14412190","14418550"," uh which is kind of nice you buy a hundred about a hundred shares here and you can make five"
"14418550","14425890"," percent in one day you put a stop loss underneath uh right where we are put it out at like"
"14425890","14433630"," um two point or two six three point nine four um you can buy a hundred shares here and make"
"14433630","14440010"," five percent in one day fucking professionals can't make that and fucking professionals can't make"
"14440010","14460280"," that in a year sometimes yeah"
"14465170","14471290"," i agree with that two-weeky like you're i think you're DCA i think your best case DCA is 260"
"14472010","14478450"," but i think your best case down move right now is 260 i think you're out of your fucking skull"
"14478450","14486050"," if you think you're getting more than uh 260 like literally out of your fucking mind um and if you"
"14486050","14491490"," think we're trading down 15 percent one day you're fucking out of your mind you're doing 20 percent"
"14491490","14499670"," one day you know i shouldn't say that if we traded 15 to percent or 20 percent today i'd probably"
"14499670","14507870"," spend about a hundred k and uh owning it right then and there but i probably would spend i would"
"14507870","14513370"," well i don't know if i could do it that fast but i'd probably call it broker or something because"
"14513370","14518290"," uh i don't know if i'd buy the underlying i think i might have to call calls because i don't"
"14518290","14527510"," believe for a minute that tesla is in any way do for 20 percent one day after um they're er"
"14527510","14534650"," call you're that's like saying they have a bad er call and they're down 50 percent like uh no don't"
"14534650","14560570"," sorry they ain't happening it's not how the stock market works yeah"
"14560570","14567330"," mannered uh manager basra the verbiage is going to matter to you i assure you that so you're likely"
"14567330","14573670"," going to see a squeeze up into it grab some liquidity and then you're going to see a hedge right"
"14573670","14583490"," into the um meeting for the rate decision and uh the key point here is um the verbiage"
"14583490","14589290"," man is going to be key dude super key i think we will get red if they are not done"
"14589290","14595250"," raising rates but i don't think you get the crash the the crash you're looking for i'm gonna in my"
"14595250","14602550"," view in my experience uh in my experience when they when they when when the when the when the when"
"14602550","14609370"," the pause is coming to an end uh or rate hikes are anticipated you'll start to see a front run"
"14609370","14613350"," of that as a matter of fact that same front running that i'm talking about a role in the market"
"14613350","14622350"," over is the same front running that i think what is going to be attempted in the pause um you"
"14622350","14626810"," would see an explosive move to the upside you're gonna remember that we have volatility in this"
"14626810","14634830"," market uh due to rate hikes right um the end of rate hikes will make uh or a pause will"
"14634830","14644550"," make sentiment bullish people will feel good about it like hey we did our job uh so you'll see a"
"14644550","14651170"," reaction trade to the upside so it will matter uh what is said in this this rate hike meeting is"
"14651170","14655830"," going to be very important and the reason i'm saying this to you earlier i was speaking about this"
"14655830","14664810"," earlier was because um go back to um go back to um the fed mouthpiece timarose and i want you"
"14664810","14671570"," to go back and read each press release like do your due diligence i do this uh go back and"
"14671570","14681310"," and read those those press releases those press releases verbiage have changed over time and they"
"14681310","14689770"," are different than what Jerome says in the presser the one you always want to go with is the press"
"14689770","14697050"," release those are the papers that are that are in stone those are the ones that in 10 years or"
"14697050","14702510"," 20 years they referenced like they will go back and be like here we're going to cite some sources"
"14702510","14708210"," here from the fed and it's going to be the press release they're not going to in 20 years go"
"14708210","14716770"," back and say oh well Jerome said this though in the presser the presser is intended as um um"
"14716770","14723590"," massaging or panicking the market it's meant to get an initial reaction for market participants"
"14723590","14734380"," rain them in whip them all that kind of stuff i'm"
"14734380","14739780"," fine with it i like these bounces uh if you get initial if you get way way high we normally"
"14739780","14749690"," slam right back down i like this right here i'm now long 275"
"14749690","14772030"," c for tomorrow for 96 cents i'm"

"14803460","14808400"," right here i'm going to show you what i'm trying to trade here my trade is right where we are"
"14808400","14817780"," right there something like that either today or tomorrow get that squeeze into friday right there"
"14817780","14826140"," that's 24th right there that's actually friday let me scoop it out a little bit so where's the"

"14858620","14875770"," trade is at least to here well my trade is to right there 275 now"
"14875770","14888130"," i'm assuming that some of you think that we're doing this right here some"
"14888130","14900560"," of you think we're doing that tomorrow i'm assuming and"
"14900560","14910390"," i think we're doing it at the worst case something like that some of those calls for tomorrow i'm"
"14910390","14920150"," not going to close them until tomorrow i'm going to leave with"
"14920150","14928750"," you on i'm going to show you the last time that happened okay i'm going to show you the last"
"14928750","14936310"," time we went down there we even got a bounce right here i'm going to show you the last time"
"14936310","14948400"," that happened okay what you're what you're asking what you're saying is happening right"
"14948400","14958300"," here maybe push higher break below this would be uh april 12th of what is that of"
"14958300","14965200"," 2022 april 12th 2022 this is when we got the roll in the market this is when the actual market"
"14965200","14974840"," crashed april 12th 2022 so i'm not with you on that trade on a pretty decent dr"
"14978730","15000170"," i'll take the risk on this trade right here that we're going up into tomorrow and"
"15000170","15009350"," we are options are priced at uh we go back down here this yellow bar is where the uh move"
"15009350","15014290"," was priced in for the 21st this is the debt this is the um what the option was priced for"
"15014290","15027280"," so i think we come back up here why"
"15027280","15033700"," do i think tesla because i think it needs to be a correction so my expectation here is that next"
"15033700","15041140"," week we'll draw this in right now i'll show you what i think happens so we'll leave this in what"
"15041140","15052680"," what bears think are going to happen so the bear thinks 275 i"
"15052680","15059740"," think that you get the relief rally in here and then i think you get continued downside into"
"15059740","15069350"," wednesday right there just something like that you get a half-back trade bam consolidates"
"15069350","15075650"," then sell off in the next week uh you cool it off and i'm going to show you why here"
"15075650","15085590"," two in a second so you have your target"
"15085590","15091110"," up here right we knew that the target was above right called that one called that one called that"
"15091110","15099910"," one um we tried three times right one two and three so what do we need to get up there"
"15099910","15105770"," and break above right we need this yellow line right here right and we need the weekly to help out"
"15105770","15115430"," right so somewhere in here like this 230 and we likely need a consolidation to do it so"
"15115430","15123350"," and we're still bullish here on tesla believe it or not we have cyber truck being rolled out we"
"15123350","15130570"," likely have fsd being rolled out here was not bad we have people taking profit so let's see people"
"15130570","15138630"," are taking profit here right so they want to deal they want to buy cheap and sell high right so"
"15138630","15144890"," we normally don't get just one straight line down in a sticker it's normally like boom boom makes"
"15144890","15153170"," sense so why do i think you get more downside i think you need people that actually buy dips to"
"15153170","15158510"," come in and want to buy again so people like me want to buy this people like me want to"
"15158510","15164910"," buy this and people like me want to buy this down here does it make sense so what i want"
"15164910","15171150"," to see is what i want to see is a quick like move down make you think we're going in"
"15171150","15179570"," come back down get a really cheap price down here right bounces straight back up right and then it"
"15179570","15189930"," consolidates makes sense maybe one more trip down consolidates we blast through 300 and"
"15189930","15194670"," you know i'm the guy down here buying this i'm the guy down here buying this you're the guy buying"
"15194670","15201090"," this up here asking why no higher than 300 see what i'm saying so like somewhere down and this is"
"15201090","15206930"," where i feel good buying tesla i feel good buying this i feel good buying a relief rally as a"
"15206930","15210590"," matter of fact i know that i'm buying this right now and a lot of you don't like buying this"
"15210590","15216950"," i know that you guys like buying this stuff i know you like buying these tops so for me this"
"15216950","15224230"," is an entry point for me this is another entry point for buying tesla these are my places here here"
"15224230","15234060"," and here regardless of what you say oh shit i'm trading at dollar"
"15234060","15243580"," eight right now woohoo you know what i'm saying so and there's a consult there's like a i should"
"15243580","15253520"," raise this up this is what i think is going to happen so it's probably slightly higher now i want"
"15253520","15260120"," to say something to you if tesla comes up here and does this stuff here and doesn't come down i"
"15260120","15268520"," would still have a stinkbit down here because it happens you'll see a stinkbit on tesla right"
"15268520","15274740"," here's a prime example right breaks up in sideways right consolidates pretend you didn't see any of"
"15274740","15281120"," this and then out of nowhere it goes right straight down you get the stinkbit fuck yeah you're"
"15281120","15287460"," riding high okay so just the same kind of a thing just in here not just another another"
"15287460","15294060"," consolidation all of a sudden when they're when it went all of a sudden it goes whew straight down"
"15294060","15299060"," and you're like right there johnny on the spot you buy it and you're fucking mooning make sense"
"15299060","15308830"," yeah i'm on uh 275s now"
"15312520","15318340"," come on 275c i think that's more reason well i think chaz posted that and i was thinking that too"
"15318340","15328250"," i'm like yeah i'm getting a little ahead of myself here so just into tomorrow"
"15328250","15334770"," i know dealers don't want to close this this low i know hedge funds are going to wrap it up"
"15334770","15343410"," at some point between now tomorrow on tesla so yeah i'm uh i think they're going to take profit and"
"15343410","15356250"," reset again to go lower yeah"
"15356250","15361590"," i got spread works too down here a really good trade right here is a like a two seven a"
"15361590","15369410"," 264 call spread for tomorrow expiry is fucking baller right now like you want to baller trade for"
"15369410","15379070"," tomorrow 264 266 it's fucking 266 270 fucking call spread expiring tomorrow on tesla fucking maw"
"15379070","15388970"," fucking baller fucking baller trade that shit's probably like a 70 guarantee sprint so"
"15388970","15396150"," there you go it's a pretty good trade i don't know i don't know how you could get a better"
"15396150","15403470"," trade so i don't know many better trades you just tagged your daily trigger on tesla i don't know"
"15403470","15409170"," what else to say to you i don't know what you want normally i get i normally i have like"
"15409170","15418350"," 1,000 people asking me uh or telling me they want to buy calls up here at 300 so you"
"15418350","15423050"," know when we're down here and there's like all you guys don't want to buy calls i think you're out"
"15423050","15432970"," of your fucking mind i'll be i'll be honest with you you know you got to put risk"
"15432970","15442330"," on you guys can't be out there watching a stock fucking just rip and face and buying tops like it's"
"15442330","15452660"," not how you make money you need to put risk on when you think it's most dangerous let me"
"15452660","15462000"," look at spy really quick i haven't looked yeah i'm not on the uh now i'm not too worried here"
"15462720","15469120"," spy can fucking start puttering sideways you got the daily trigger fucking just racing up right now"
"15469600","15476020"," you got earnings season we haven't had any bad earnings yet you got like all the dealers have to"
"15476020","15481840"," close this shit on friday i think i think if you're looking at spy looking at it like this like"
"15481840","15492280"," a spy is going to be uh like this just nice and slow and gentle like"
"15492280","15500420"," that it's not going to be like this sorry you're not getting it you're getting this you're not"
"15500420","15509800"," getting this in my view so you got the daily trigger just racing up at it right now it's cooling"
"15509800","15515800"," off you got the hourly cooling off like they're coming for you these fucking bulls are coming i'm"
"15515800","15520960"," telling you you don't fucking believe me these fucking bulls are coming for you the only thing"
"15520960","15525380"," they're looking for is a cheap buy that's it it's all they're looking for i don't know a single"
"15525380","15533380"," fucking bull that thinks that this market uh is gonna crash they just want a cheaper price that's"
"15533380","15540100"," it so when you see a bull wanting a cheaper price they tend not to get it like they'll get"
"15540100","15546440"," it uh they'll get part of it but they're not going to be given their fucking wish list you ain't"
"15546440","15553040"," getting your wish list um so if you want to put a put spread on or a i don't know"
"15553040","15555800"," if you want to pull you put spread on i guess you could do it do something in the money"
"15555800","15563340"," um but i think that you're still measuring your um i think you're still measuring your expectations"
"15563340","15569900"," yeah i guess if if power could do one thing it would be fucking awesome it would be um if"
"15569900","15578700"," power could do one great thing it would be it would be fucking awesome to see power like give us"
"15578700","15588760"," 25 bps and tell us no pause that'd be fucking awesome because then we get a correction uh"
"15588760","15595400"," another cool thing would be if power gave us 50 bps because then we get a correction again that's"
"15595400","15600320"," what i would really like to see because i would love to buy like if i could buy fucking spy"
"15600320","15614670"," at like i don't know 430 420 i'd be fucking a happy man i'd be really happy I"
"15614670","15621110"," would i'd be stoked i don't think i'd do a bull out there that wouldn't love it's funny because"
"15621110","15627310"," like uh bears are like that'll cause a crash and i'm like dude bulls are just begging begging to"
"15627310","15633870"," buy a correction like just begging but you need a reason to do it you get you need a reason"
"15633870","15642700"," like there has to be some kind of bullshit reason to do it they gotta they gotta make up some"
"15642700","15648320"," shit they gotta put some fear in the market like not enough to crash it but just enough to to"
"15648320","15654880"," cool it off the only other way i could think about would be the um the bond vigilantes they can"
"15654880","15660460"," do it too um if you get some of the major liquidity providers in the market if they were to"

"18018540","18026520"," uh and the nearest one to be produced next is still being developed in a dry dock like so their"
"18026520","18033320"," newest sub i think i think it's uh been in development for 30 years that's how old their sub plate"
"18033320","18043250"," is uh when ussr dissolved all that money went away yeah that's what"
"18043250","18049150"," they did right uh they stopped pouring money into there another fascinating thing here too is uh"
"18049150","18056710"," like Ukraine used to be like the fighting class for uh russia so i don't know if you guys know"
"18056710","18064770"," this but a lot of the tip of the spear in the united states army is southern people um and"
"18064770","18069350"," they they there are a lot of southerners make up uh the tip of the spear for the united states"
"18070350","18076190"," not all it's not the entire demographic but it's a large percentage of our demographic uh for our"
"18076190","18080730"," like fighting class if you had a fighting class in the u.s you'd probably look towards uh"
"18080730","18090510"," southerners uh believe it or not um like a warrior culture and um maybe not like the best boxers or"
"18090510","18096450"," something but like a fighter uh war uh willing to go to war and be the tip of the spirit"
"18096450","18102030"," typically southerners uh and that's like pretty much what Ukraine is like uh most of the fighting"
"18102030","18108450"," class for russia were Ukrainians um and that's where they kept all their missiles too you guys know"
"18108450","18113510"," that like all the nuclear technology so when you see all the gaming that comes out of Ukraine it's"
"18113510","18127980"," because a lot of the technology uh came out of Ukraine it was kind of wild too yeah"
"18127980","18135240"," they got subs and nukes um yeah i agree with that too whether they whether they work is really a"
"18135240","18142900"," big question mark the amount of money it takes to keep nukes uh serviceable is insane um and then"
"18142900","18148500"," you're talking about the cadre the upkeep and then you're talking about becoming a fourth and fifth"
"18148500","18155200"," generation uh fighting there's another there's another way apart to this like they have um it's"
"18155200","18163240"," like a give uh first second third fourth fifth generation war fighting right and we're we're on the"
"18163240","18169080"," cusp of sixth generation right now we more than likely have sixth generation that is not discussed"
"18169080","18175960"," and talked about uh but we're on the cusp of six not even fifth anymore uh fifth gen war fighting"
"18175960","18184740"," the one and this is this is kind of fascinating like um that we're heading there right now and uh"
"18184740","18192040"," some of that i think they can keep up with like the the fast attack boats is a way to"
"18192040","18201660"," keep up with uh fifth and sixth generation war fighting and uh drone fight like you can get cheap"
"18201660","18207260"," drones right uh to keep up with sixth generation fifth sixth generation war fighting you can't keep"
"18207260","18214600"," up with all of it but there are some ways to keep up with it sellers want to get down"
"18214600","18219160"," here and tag this s3 into the clothes they're really looking to get down here just wrap it up for"
"18219160","18224220"," the week four fifty two they want to tag four fifty one seventy four they got clothes they tag four"
"18224220","18230840"," seventy four fifty two there is a slight possibility uh they can come down here and tag this one uh"
"18230840","18234860"," so this possible you still have some hope ahead of you if you're uh if you're a bear that you"
"18234860","18242060"," get that nice clothes today i'm not anti that happening i am looking for an up trade on friday i'm"

"18308900","18317480"," tomorrow right down there uh hold on a second here you that right there this is the first level"
"18317480","18322920"," that you're fighting for you can see where we have demand right back here uh so you need to try"

"18330080","18336600"," closed tomorrow you just have to stay below the hourly trigger right here which i think you can do"
"18337120","18342800"," i just don't know when you get it i think it's i think it's tomorrow over here or it's further"
"18342800","18347260"," down the road into monday i think the dealers are going to fuck you in the ass but that's okay"
"18347260","18356680"," so good job you we are now definitely uh not we are definitely confirmed that this is a top and"

"18365700","18371960"," expectations on your downside move on that confirmation i'm going to show you previous examples on"
"18371960","18379580"," what to expect you can see right here you've got one that failed to hit daily right level one that"
"18379580","18384820"," reversed on you so if we ever reverse at any point and confirm above the hourly trigger your trade"
"18384820","18390260"," is over uh we failed to hit daily trigger here we failed to hit daily trigger here we hit it"
"18390260","18395640"," way back here on may 24th but since then we have not hit it at all we haven't had a"
"18395640","18405240"," single correction going back to uh april 23rd we had a correction on april 23rd if you even want to"
"18405240","18410960"," call it that we are due for one the longer that we the longer that we stretch this out here"
"18411480","18418040"," to the stretch right here the more of a chance of a correction when you start to see stuff like"
"18418040","18425620"," this you're going to expect at some point reach down and move higher you should you should see in a"
"18425620","18431320"," bull run about three to four of them in each bull run we have not seen one yet uh so"
"18431320","18439920"," bears and myself and i think most bulls are hoping for at some point some kind of a corrective"
"18439920","18449280"," measure uh right now i've got call our puts for the 10th of october there's 432 i also have 420"
"18449280","18456680"," but that was for this one to correct never happened we just kept going higher squeeze and higher"
"18456680","18464660"," squeeze and higher so you have the confirmation right now your price targets for this uh for this"
"18464660","18471360"," correct or this or this pullback uh for friday is 443 at the max if you wanted like a death"
"18471360","18479140"," like death killer something like that is 443 71 you've got 450 45 right here see it so this is"
"18479140","18488780"," friday 440 you got 450 right there and you've got like a max max destruction down here at 443 if"
"18488780","18494980"," you wanted you could also look for the daily trigger into wednesday if it takes us longer than"
"18494980","18502080"," expected uh your expectation for wednesday is going to be about 445 instead of that 440 down below"
"18502080","18512010"," here so about about 50 points will come up you can't get heavy selling i think that's"
"18512010","18519290"," all i got um yeah and yeah something like that then pull this back up start selling this back down"
"18519290","18539300"," into next week this is uh 12 o'clock on the 21st something like that yeah"
"18539300","18548900"," when 2800 not happening chase you're out of your mind uh if you want to see it i can show"
"18548900","18555100"," it to you you want to see it you want to see that trade chase i can show it to"
"18555100","18566400"," you you ready i'll show it to you right now uh this is spx chase"

"18571580","18579180"," this is the top uh if you want if you want if you want to try it that for a"
"18579180","18588950"," chase i can do in five seconds you're ready uh but but uh 2800 right there"
"18588950","18595940"," uh there's your 2800 chase i"
"18595940","18603100"," can't believe i'm doing this i can't believe i'm entertaining this"
"18603100","18612060"," but wait a minute are you ready buddy"
"18612060","18623510"," something like that right there something"
"18623510","18630310"," like that right there might be farther around in time let's probably farther out so that's November"
"18630310","18639390"," when we make that January hold on bam trying you can take a snap of this"
"18639390","18655120"," hold on a second i got your brother this is like January over here okay i"
"18655120","18666220"," got you man let's try"
"18666220","18672860"," that right there that's your best case let's the September dude all right so um if you did get that"
"18672860","18684520"," you would see this is what you'd be looking for um a break below right here right oh"
"18684520","18692240"," you'd look for a break above right here you'd look for a break below right here and"
"18692240","18702060"," you would look for somewhere in here right"
"18702060","18712200"," here right about there somewhere in"
"18712200","18722050"," there would be a confirmation um let me just start that just start that"
"18722050","18730070"," down move brother somewhere in there the cool part about this chart though is this uh school i'm"
"18730070","18733290"," not going to do all the greens all the way down but uh the cool part about this chart is"
"18733290","18739370"," this if we do roll down or begin the process of rolling down uh let's say you're long the"
"18739370","18745610"," underlying you're still going to have a chance and a failure here to find out first um so you're"
"18745610","18752970"," still you still would have captured all this money to right here and then you can start all the way"
"18752970","18761310"," down uh but there's there's like you're pretty much in a failure you're in a failure to um if you"
"18761310","18769250"," think we're going to 2,800 you're on a correction basically you're on a you're on a correction path"
"18769250","18777330"," with a failure it's right around here a failure to make a new high in a correction that's what"
"18777330","18782670"," you're looking for like right there a failure right here would if that started to roll that would"
"18782670","18791890"," be your signal that we are at the top so let's call it um on if we had a correction"
"18791890","18797450"," today or if we were starting an x correction day you would likely have a failure to close back"
"18797450","18807170"," above 4450 mark my words on that 4450 to close that uh"
"18807170","18817450"," and then you'd know then you'd go short you go short at 4450 to close above it so"
"18817450","18825670"," if you've got uh if you've got uh 2,800 puts for September October or something or March for"
"18825670","18835530"," September October um September October crash you're probably a little early does that answer your"
"18835530","18857970"," question Chase yeah"
"18857970","18862490"," if you wanted to like if you wanted crash puts for 2,800 you'd uh wait for the uh failure"
"18862490","18873310"," to get back to um he'd wait for the failure to get back to um 451"
"18873310","18880550"," 93 you wanted to show you a previous example I can pretty easy to show I'm going to show you"
"18880550","18890440"," SPX the last time we did it you're ready for it uh we"
"18890440","18896900"," have the initial roll here right come back down there's your cross right there there's your second"
"18896900","18902420"," cross right there these are two big ones but pretend you didn't see this uh pretend you didn't see"
"18902420","18909100"," any of this over here uh the confirmation was hold on confirmation you get the the initial"
"18909100","18915740"," correction right you break down below the white line actually crosses which never happens uh so"
"18915740","18920440"," that's your that's your first signal right there is that you got to cross that's your first failure"
"18920440","18925480"," and then you get your second failure right here and this is the one that actually um guarantees it"
"18926040","18935980"," so the short on the crash in 2022 was on April 10th and the crazy part"
"18935980","18949290"," about that is um if you had cut yourself loose as a bull you would have captured all"
"18949290","18953730"," of that right there so as a bull you made up oh wait a minute you guys can't see all"
"18953730","18964250"," this that's why you don't sell the market uh you"
"18964250","18970490"," see the bull cross right there you long it until you get confirmation of a roll on a higher time"
"18970490","18975110"," frame so you long this whole fucking thing and you notice how the white line doesn't cross right"
"18975110","18980190"," here doesn't cross right there in a correction doesn't cross right there it doesn't cross right"
"18980190","18987650"," there but you did get a cross right here and that showed you the roll right and even when you"
"18987650","18994170"," rolled down you still had an opportunity to sell the spy and you made this entire run right here"
"18994170","19004870"," and you were able to participate in the down move right here that makes sense money baby so"
"19004870","19016310"," if we do crash or at any point you will always have an opportunity to sell it you're"
"19016310","19023810"," really looking for you're really looking for this right here um on a visit daily chart you're"
"19023810","19031810"," really looking for this right here you're really looking for this cross right here like this is the"
"19031810","19037150"," one right here uh like so if this white line comes down and goes up comes down and goes up"
"19037150","19042550"," it means nothing it's just a correction if this white line actually crosses right here that's the"
"19042550","19047990"," one that you're like fuck you were selling everything so this that right there is the one that"
"19047990","19054990"," you're like oh shit the where the top is in to make sense but you should have still bought this"
"19054990","19060050"," right here because you gotta run that all the way up and then you would run this all the way"
"19060050","19065930"," down and we have this right now I'm gonna show it to you on a smaller time frame so we"
"19065930","19072610"," have this right now in a smaller time frame the five minute chart we have it you see it it's"
"19072610","19078790"," right there it's a five minute chart right this is your cross on the five minute you're likely"
"19078790","19085550"," going to see one more pull up here and then more continuation of the downside this is the same"
"19085550","19099280"," chart on a daily chart back in 2022 23 you see it it's fairly easy to see yeah I"
"19099280","19113690"," don't care have I"
"19113690","19118250"," seen the chart showing QQQ level in global central bank liquidity is off the charts quickly way"
"19118250","19127950"," down below I don't believe yeah I got some calls for tomorrow to unspy I got spy and tesicles"
"19127950","19134990"," you've never been more bearish than now although realized bluff can continue more after some"
"19134990","19142050"," correction yeah that's my thing on that that's my thing on the top chase is whatever that happens"
"19142050","19150890"," you're gonna get fair warning of it so you'll have fair warning so there's like time"
"19150890","19158950"," it doesn't just like go straight to the depths of how so if we do you don't panic you just"
"19158950","19165510"," like hold you wait for the capitulation on the daily chart and then you fucking sell your all your"
"19165510","19172630"," lungs so like if you're long so if you're buying so I have an investment account right I won't sell"
"19172630","19178850"," that unless we get that big cross and then whatever capitulation trade higher it is then I would"
"19178850","19186530"," cut my lungs loose yeah you remember that right"
"19186530","19202030"," do you see it yeah definitely it's pretty easy yeah I"
