"5300","7440"," I failed to post the tweet."
"10840","12260"," Are we actually live or no?"
"15490","16670"," This is really weird."
"20570","21970"," Can't tell if we're live or not. "
"51810","55880"," It's really weird."
"57660","58520"," Okay, let's find out."
"58780","59960"," Can you guys hear me out there?"
"60140","64880"," Because I think I keep thinking that I have a little second here. "
"64880","71200"," I keep thinking that I have, on my end, on the video side of my stuff, it's saying that I'm"
"71200","76460"," having failures to connect around."
"76680","77260"," Good morning, everybody."
"77980","78580"," Hang tight here. "
"78640","79720"," I've got to take care of some trades."
"140490","141190"," All right."
"141390","142970"," We'll get to start here in just a second. "
"144190","147550"," I've got some put spreads out there and some puts and some other stuff."
"147550","154070"," And I've got some zero to eight calls and a bunch of put spreads heading today."
"154510","156890"," Now we do have a lot to talk about this morning. "
"157870","159690"," So we're going to talk about it now."
"171160","174360"," And the implications specifically to what happened this morning."
"175260","203240"," Now last night's in, what is going on with the, all right,"
"203260","205060"," so let's talk about some stuff this morning. "
"205760","212700"," There are some implications for this move down this morning that we touched upon briefly in last"
"212700","213380"," night's broadcast."
"213800","219200"," First thing I want to talk to you about is that the banks had closed shorts on Friday."
"219980","229880"," Further, they had taken out puts down to the 420 level and"
"229880","237280"," with a magnet to 428 expiring on February 18th. "
"238740","240120"," There were also hedge funds."
"240180","246080"," We noted this in the video last night that there were also hedge funds that pulled or purchased a"
"246080","252440"," lot of call flow expiring this Friday on the market as well."
"252740","257980"," It was much smaller call flow than the put hedges down to 420. "
"263350","266990"," But with that said, the move down."
"266990","270650"," We could have, last night I showed you the SPX cap."
"271370","273430"," Let me take a look at that real quick, it was a matter of fact. "
"275250","278830"," There was a cache gap to close down on SPX."
"280190","282370"," I want to see that before I keep back in here."
"284790","288430"," Just make sure that we are below that cache gap. "
"294060","294780"," And we are."
"295000","295100"," Okay."
"296000","302280"," So, there are implications for where we are in the market right now. "
"302940","308900"," There is, hold on here guys."
"312400","322340"," So on Friday and all last week, the put gammaw was down around 420 and"
"322340","329500"," there were major hedges taking out a 428 that were supposed to expire on February 18th or are"
"329500","330980"," expiring on February 18th."
"332440","340780"," There was also small call positions put out in the money on Friday that expire this Friday. "
"343080","351000"," Now the damage that's been done this morning on this open does open the door"
"351000","357180"," to a move down to 406 or so, 405."
"360740","368140"," Now this morning we have to pay attention closely to any new flow that comes in and how soon that"
"368140","368700"," will happen."
"369480","375880"," Now the last thing I left you with last night was the real problem for the marketplace is a sense"
"375880","379240"," of panic that can overtake the markets. "
"380140","385640"," Sometimes I tell you that retail does not matter, but there are moments where retail does matter"
"385640","394240"," and especially if small money comes to its own mind, they can't actually move markets."
"395540","402680"," So this move down this morning does break some structure critical to understand that as we open up"
"402680","408140"," this morning and it does open the door at this point where the door wasn't quite open yesterday"
"408140","415760"," down to 400, it is most definitely open this morning to 400 believe it or not."
"416260","423040"," Much lower than the 430 or the 428 tag would would imply. "
"423700","430840"," The key this morning is going to be watching for the flow that comes in this morning to see if"
"430840","436120"," anyone has triggered to purchase puts even lower than the current 420."
"437580","446280"," Normally we shouldn't hit 420 unless we start to purchase 410s, 415s, 400s, things like that."
"446700","451860"," So that's going to be the thing to be looking for this morning is what kind of flow comes into"
"451860","453580"," the market at this point. "
"453580","461040"," Even if we have a snapback this morning, the key is going to be watching if we get further"
"461040","467220"," expansion to the downside and we have some key levels that were broken."
"467800","476100"," These things are not to be messed with or these are not things to be trifled with I guess I"
"476100","476580"," should say."
"481790","488230"," Give me just a second I'm trying to bring up some thought I had some programs here that are not"
"488230","489530"," loading up yet this morning. "
"495120","501980"," And the implication from last night and maybe even the implication for me Kevin's selling is that"
"501980","504180"," it reverberates through the market."
"504180","512960"," It starts to shake our bulls I should say from the feeling or the thought process"
"512960","520679"," that they're going to be able to get out of their long positions in time and it becomes that almost"
"520679","528780"," like that Mexican standoff where you panic you wonder hey are they going to hold the market up long"
"528780","534620"," enough for me to get out of my apple positions to get out of my Amazon positions my Shopify"
"534620","542060"," positions and we spoke extensively over the over the over last week about where Shopify and where"
"542060","549140"," Amazon are where there's a chasm below these large stocks that hold up the market this morning you"
"549140","557000"," see Tesla was down 45 points you see that Shopify one point was down I think it was more than"
"557000","565880"," 30 maybe it is 30 points 33 points this morning there's also other neat notes this morning"
"565880","574380"," I was surprised to see Peton was up while the rest of the market was down to show the pure"
"574380","580660"," manipulation that goes on inside of the market they went down I guess in pre market eventually but"
"580660","586060"," they were being held up as best that they could hold it up now there were some other notes this"
"586060","594760"," morning Amazon at one point was down Amazon was down at 2762 so you will see a short covering"
"594760","601420"," operation this morning to some extent the real concern though is the damage that is done at this"
"601420","609800"," point into the market when you hit marks like we did this morning especially on play on on ETFs"
"609800","616980"," like the spy it opens the door too much lower I'm taking a look at the flow from last Friday"
"616980","626840"," the hedging was down to 419 the put flow was down to 425 428"
"626840","632500"," somewhere and somewhere in that rough vicinity right there and it looks like they've printed this"
"632500","640500"," morning I just closed out some of my put hedges on the spy I have left my my calls in"
"640500","650560"," place on the spy and I have left my puts on Peton so far this morning Thanks"
"650560","660540"," right here but the key this"
"660540","666580"," morning is going to be watching what takes place and it comes back to that same old conversation"
"666580","675220"," which is do you feel comfortable buying this market at 440 450 470 480 no we none of us do"
"675220","682780"," it comes back to the conversation of what is a 50% retracement what's a 38% retracement and those"
"682780","691060"," levels are much lower than where we are right now and so the implication is where do we go and"
"691060","699820"," the trigger this morning is huge when you see spy trade down like we did into this morning down to"
"699820","708360"," that fourth down into that 430 level I think it was 430 58 we can easily at this point trade"
"708360","715380"," down the next stop below is going to be for us to trade down into that 400 level so if"
"715380","722180"," you are or are not prepared for that to happen I would let you know at this point that most"
"722180","729900"," of the rest of the market is prepared for that eventual eventuality to happen at this point we're"
"734670","740450"," going to take it quickly I want to see Shopify this morning I'm really interested in both of those"
"740450","751950"," companies Shopify and Amazon still it's also"
"751950","761550"," interesting to see this morning comparatively pallet or piton versus other companies like"
"761550","771250"," snap versus companies like hood air B and B paypal and"
"771250","778810"," to see the resistance to that one company uber I think was down at one point it was down to"
"778810","787170"," four thirty four dollars this morning kind of similar to where piton is in terms of a drop but not"
"787170","794150"," exactly it's interesting to see that it's being held that that piton is being held up versus"
"794150","803030"," companies that should have come down as far as they want them to so I'm wondering I'm wondering"
"803030","809570"," about companies like like uber specifically this morning companies that dropped overnight more"
"809570","820870"," severe than other companies like"
"820870","832900"," square had a pretty significant drop in the overnight my price"
"832900","846780"," target of arcade 65 is not quite there it's it hit 67 64 this morning I'm just"
"846780","856600"," trying to catch up here with some of these tickers to see what insights they"
"856600","867400"," lend to the market Tesla's"
"867400","876560"," beginning to sell off it's now down to eight eighty three seventy seven we're going to look below"
"876560","882520"," here and just take a look I want you to realize that the hero indicator is showing negative this"
"882520","895610"," morning on the spy we do have more sellers than buyers this morning and you are"
"895610","901190"," seeing this 400 number firm up a little bit even if we snap back this morning you are starting to"
"901190","923120"," see buyers step in down below at 400 and I will"
"923120","929800"," say that the damage is done to the market the trigger of us trading down over into this morning is"
"929800","939880"," going to create some market panic we've"
"939880","955180"," broken below 430 stunning"
"958080","964780"," absolutely stunning to see this this morning not only does this trigger move down to 400 at some"
"964780","973280"," point uh it opens the door to 400 but also in the in what took place in this moment the"
"973280","981140"," way that we're trading down this morning actually sets up a bear market and sets up further decline"
"981140","988720"," if we continue to trade down to even that 400 in this time frame the time frame is critical and"
"988720","998810"," crucial to how we are selling down right now I love it"
"998810","1002510"," I love it I don't love it I'm not sure if I love it yet try I have a lot"
"1002510","1008490"," of a lot of information going through my mind right now a lot of complications the implications of"
"1008490","1015830"," this are not positive nor healthy whenever we see moves down like this in this kind of a time frame"
"1016630","1041079"," in previous history at least it shows more than just a normal corrective moment Airbnb"
"1041079","1048100"," is now beginning to sell off they were at 144 or they opened it this morning at 148 they're down"
"1048100","1055560"," to 144 this morning you are going to see implications we talked last night about you know if me"
"1055560","1064120"," Kevin sells his position in reality it puts a lot of these other mean pumpers in the wrong position"
"1064120","1069880"," that he was able to sell out of his position while a lot of these other guys out there are"
"1069880","1075740"," kind of left holding the bags right that was our conversation and you are seeing capitulation this"
"1075740","1083620"," morning in a lot of these speculative growth stocks the question becomes did that trigger a lot of"
"1083620","1100120"," the the capitulation move this morning in the markets did that create panic looks"
"1103220","1112360"," like there's some support setting up down below here at 428 39 the hero indicator is turning"
"1112360","1122000"," slightly positive at this point you are seeing some"
"1122000","1131920"," support build down below here 428 53 426 50 will look slightly lower and see"
"1131920","1157270"," if there's any any more threat of further downside today 426"
"1157270","1164470"," 57 if we are to move up today too there is a lot of resistance and ice above up to"
"1164470","1174350"," 435 53 then of course next time next target above is 439 84 but"
"1174350","1183440"," I do want you to know that we did some damage"
"1183440","1193300"," this morning very cool to see very not normal to see the last time we saw a capitulation move"
"1193300","1201120"," of this magnitude I did measure this this weekend and the move that we are making right now is more"
"1201120","1207760"," we haven't had a move like this specifically but I believe at this point now it's going back to"
"1207760","1216220"," March 2020 I think this even beats at this point I'm gonna have to re-measure again but I think"
"1216220","1251700"," this does beat the July or June 2020 move and even the August capitulation move hero"
"1251700","1261600"," indicator is very negative at this point again once again large cell program on the market at this"
"1261600","1299390"," point we"
"1299390","1314900"," have now moved down to 428 54 there is"
"1314900","1322020"," real danger in the market I cannot impress upon you this move down this morning the implications on"
"1322020","1331880"," the market Tesla has now fallen"
"1331880","1341360"," 85 points we've spoken about the 750 price targets we spoke last week about the danger to Amazon"
"1341360","1348740"," and Shopify and what kind of a and Shopify surprisingly has not moved down they are pinned"
"1349280","1357380"," currently down below here at 426 39 we're gonna take a look at Shopify right now because if the"
"1357380","1366820"," market is going to have a crash moment you are going to be looking for companies like Amazon Apple"
"1366820","1382460"," Shopify to capitulate these will be the companies that will force that capitulation move if we do"
"1382460","1394440"," end up seeing it in the market and"
"1394440","1400820"," this really is where you want to be concerned when you see areas like this that are black and not"
"1400820","1408820"," blue or white if you begin to see a company like Shopify begin to sell down it looks like we"
"1408820","1414620"," have more buyers than sellers here this is a good sign to see right now but it is on a"
"1414620","1421700"," key level of support the next key level of support is 800 but let's Shopify here why you guys to"
"1421700","1431260"," see what can actually take place and below 800 there is clear skies"
"1431260","1441220"," below to 750 down below here looks like some of these companies like"
"1441220","1449560"," Shopify if companies like Shopify give it up the implication on the market this morning we're going"
"1449560","1457080"," to look at Amazon next I want to take a look and see how precarious Amazon is this morning and"
"1462040","1470260"," surprisingly our Shopify doesn't look as bad as I was thinking so it's good to see Shopify holding"
"1470260","1492250"," on we'll look at Tesla thereafter and"
"1492250","1497930"," then we'll look at Apple we want to look at the internals of the market the under the hood stuff"
"1534940","1554660"," might just turn this spy feed off for just a minute while Amazon loads here you"
"1554660","1562480"," could see Amazon trying to crawl its way back this morning this is good to see here this bounce"
"1562480","1569820"," below on Amazon at 2780 this climb above is important to see here indicator is slightly negative"
"1569820","1579200"," this morning there are more sellers though than buyers this area above at 2847 we don't want this"
"1579200","1585200"," to turn into any kind of resistance here I want to show you the implications and what I'm speaking"
"1585200","1595130"," of next target"
"1595130","1609000"," below is 2750 again but let's look even deeper below this area for Amazon 2700"
"1609000","1613760"," and I want you to be key into this stuff when you see stuff like this where you don't see"
"1613760","1620480"," a lot of white or blue these are these are zones where you don't just break through and you kind"
"1620480","1630420"," of you weigh down you end up having large drops in areas like this these are very"
"1630420","1636000"," destabilizing to the market when you see zones like this down below and how far the market can"
"1636000","1643040"," actually fall if companies like Amazon give it up companies like Shopify these don't look like the"
"1643040","1652560"," Tesla and the Apple charts yeah it's very scary right now for the market"
"1657600","1664460"," so pay attention to Amazon today pay attention to Shopify I think you'll have to pay attention to"
"1664460","1671280"," those tickers even more so than the Teslas and apples I think that those are the concerning ones"
"1673700","1678420"," we're gonna look at Apple next then we'll look up Tesla and we'll make our way back to the spy"
"1723080","1732020"," I'm gonna get my Tesla 750 I'd be shocked if I did I'd be happy too but just very shocked"
"1732020","1740800"," that it's happening today it's possible today that it's gonna happen and you'll see more do you see"
"1740800","1769720"," how there's more traffic on Apple still haven't seen capitulation here if"
"1774870","1781590"," you are an Apple investor 150 is the price target on Apple even if we are at 159.60 right"
"1781590","1791520"," now there is a giant"
"1791520","1797200"," wall of sellers that have come down on Apple they used to be up around 190.200 and they are"
"1797200","1807640"," slowly moving down most"
"1807640","1817580"," certainly there's no support on Apple right now see if we can see this 150"
"1817580","1827570"," number again you have weak support at 158 "
"1827570","1836130",".44 medium sized support at 155 price target 150.36 on Apple"
"1836130","1898440"," we'll look at Tesla next so"
"1898440","1927900"," load up here for just a second look at"
"1927900","1937900"," that move on on Tesla here 1 2 3 4 5 6 layers of dip buyers this is"
"1937900","1947820"," a major break of support in Tesla this morning a"
"1947820","1955220"," bounce down below here at 865 64 we're gonna take a look below and see I think we took a"
"1955220","1965170"," look here on Thursday or Friday down at that 750 level we're gonna see if that's actually"
"1965170","2004730"," attainable or not I"
"2004730","2010470"," would say Tesla is a little more vulnerable than Apple is at this point your next target below this"
"2010470","2020170"," 850 mark is going to be straight down to 850 or to 800 it's concerning"
"2020170","2032890"," to see a lot of this black area in here 800"
"2032890","2040190"," is firming up more so than 750 this is good to see it's showing buyers stepping up slightly higher"
"2040190","2046990"," than they were before the banks were down around 750 last week it looks like they are stepping up"
"2046990","2056969"," and above here for for Tesla at the 800 level as an area to fight for the conscience of that"
"2078690","2086710"," here indicator is very negative on Tesla at this point as well we do have more dip buyers stepping"
"2086710","2092449"," in on Tesla that would be to be expected but I do want to give you warning this morning that"
"2092449","2100630"," there are there's a lot of negative flow coming into Tesla this morning it would not be it would"
"2100630","2110510"," not be surprising to see a retest of 850 and then further move down below to 800 there is"
"2110510","2187610"," real risk of that happening due to the negative flow coming in on Tesla so"
"2296310","2305610"," at this moment here at 427.75 there should be some resistance some natural resistance for further"
"2305610","2314450"," sell down this morning but we have some real negative flow coming into this market currently if we"
"2314450","2362170"," break through this level between here and 426 the next price target down below will be 406 and you"
"2362170","2400330"," can see that this is a key support area for the spy there is"
"2400330","2442290"," one other place to take note at 426.10 also"
"2442290","2452090"," 425.22 I want you to look down below here and and see that there's no support underneath at this"
"2452090","2463780"," point next price"
"2463780","2482980"," target 400 this"
"2482980","2492660"," could be epic to watch here if we don't stop where we are right now very dangerous apples"
"2546070","2570030"," holding up quite well amazons holding up quite well even with the aggressive selling Shopify"
"2570030","2576130"," is holding up quite well as well it is not broken through the 800 level any break below 800 is"
"2576130","2594920"," on shop is going to be very dangerous not"

"4473890","4484110"," have slight interest in February 7 400p this"
"4484110","4498350"," is certainly an expansion to the downside betting on the downside over time we'll"
"4498350","4511360"," take a look for a bit further out of note"
"4511360","4520680"," the February 18 420p's have been closed out on the spy but"

"4574480","4592650"," is all new all new stuff from today well son of a bit there"
"4592650","4606250"," is substantial put hedges coming in in the market at this point down to 400 and"
"4606250","4615830"," it's littering littering the options chain of the spy as deep as March but some serious"
"4615830","4641520"," consideration that we can hit 400p before end of week whoo"
"4641520","4648000"," that got my stomach turned seeing all that all that put flow and hedging this is some pretty major"
"4648000","4680860"," hedging down to the 400p level be conscience of that at this point so"
"4680860","4687980"," 400 is back on the table hello ladies I would not have expected that this morning this was a very"
"4687980","4694500"," this is a very outlier event good to see at the faster that we get down to 400 the happier"
"4694500","4702480"," that I am the time frame that it took to even begin to start talking about a new price target"
"4702480","4710240"," at target of 400 this quickly is unhealthy for the market this is not how you have an orderly"
"4710240","4720060"," market sell the implications will be far ranging if we had implications before of let's say a"
"4720060","4729300"," one to three month recovery this looks further out possibly three to six months at this point we"
"4729300","4736140"," are seeing expansion to the downside to 400 be aware of this this morning no matter what anyone"
"4736140","4742440"," else is telling you out there there is some large hedging coming into the market this morning down"
"4742440","4750660"," to the 400 level there's a large concentration this week and some further out hedging into March"
"4757410","4767410"," got to turn this down be very wary this morning of any kind of recovery in the market you are"
"4767410","4775310"," seeing some resistance beginning to firm up at 428.89 you can just kick this 433 out the window at"
"4775310","4780970"," this point well it looks like it's going away or they're stepping down below here I want you to be"
"4780970","4787470"," very concerned okay so I've got flow coming through now February 18th 412 P right we already talked"
"4787470","4795030"," about this before the flow was coming out publicly I did scroll through the options chains on the"
"4795030","4802570"," spy and there is some major hedging coming to end now this is showing 412 but I'm seeing it down"
"4802570","4809370"," at 400 if if I can find this flow inside the market I'll I'll tell you guys about it but"
"4809370","4817310"," whether it was said or not there is major hedges down at the 400 level for this entire week and"

"4850200","4855040"," I'll do is I'll bring this flow well this flow is not coming in right now I'm going to go"
"4855040","4863560"," back through though and highlight these same dates for you so that you can find them for yourself I"
"4863560","4870460"," want you to take a look at January 24 this just happened maybe 15 minutes ago there is a switch"
"4870460","4880400"," to 420 P expiring today January 24 there's now 90,000 contracts on 420 P"
"4880400","4890060"," expiring today January 24 January 26 415"
"4890060","4899620"," P there are 24 24 600 contracts on 420 or excuse me 415 P"
"4899620","4909180"," that would lend us to a slide down over the next two days into Wednesday we have 60 "
"4909180","4928820",",000 contracts out at 420 P on January 28th and then the"
"4928820","4948750"," real killer here is we have 12,000 contracts at 400 P on January 31 the"
"4948750","4955750"," next major concentration that I can see is February 18th now this the hedging that was done on"
"4955750","4964230"," February 18th was originally at 419 or so those have been lifted and now they have been placed"
"4964230","4988780"," lower at 412 also"
"4988780","4994720"," of note this morning in one of my chat rooms I'm hearing that all flow services were down this"
"4994720","5007950"," morning so I will go through some of the flow that is just coming up now at this point yeah"
"5007950","5013330"," and see none of this stuff is showing these these price targets here I guess well yeah we did have"
"5013330","5020590"," the one come up 218 for 12 puts came up at 7.8 million dollars heavy put flow in Ford"

"5048190","5061220"," of real"
"5061220","5067520"," concern is the expansion to the downside I want you to be aware of that when you start to see"
"5067520","5074140"," put flow coming into the market that's much lower this is very abnormal for us to see it down at"
"5074140","5081800"," that 400 level we're seeing no range expansion to the upside so outside of short covering that'll"
"5081800","5123630"," take place within the spy we are trading down I"
"5123630","5128850"," want to also lend one word of caution to you out there this morning if any of you are paying"
"5128850","5136510"," attention to flow services I would not trust any of the flow that's coming out this morning there"
"5136510","5145910"," is under the surface stealth hedging going on inside this market currently be very very cautious"
"5145910","5154670"," this morning on any positive flow that you see now I'm starting to see come in currently the Q's"
"5154670","5164110"," January 28 3 45 P for 6.8 million dollars this is accurate to the moment and then some follow"
"5164110","5171110"," through with January 24 3 40 P for 230 thousand dollars half million dollars coming in on January"
"5171110","5177810"," 28 4 20 P for four hundred and nine thousand dollars this is all current right now at the moment"
"5177810","5186030"," but I want to warn you that the flow this morning is inaccurate there is some under the surface put"
"5186030","5195510"," hedging on the market down to 400 this morning you won't find that flow anywhere on your services"
"5195510","5206890"," that are out there this morning you have"
"5206890","5212830"," to dig through the I I got some begging you out there to I want you to look through your"
"5212830","5220030"," options chains on your brokerages and there is more going on underneath the surface than big banks"
"5220030","5233520"," are letting you in on this morning what we"
"5233520","5272490"," got here 430 and then for that still that same tag above at 432 there"
"5272490","5281090"," are now 97,000 contracts on 420 P expiring today I think earlier when I first started I was roughly"
"5281090","5352230"," about 84,000 contracts it's now it's now basically at 100,000 contracts 420 P all"
"5352230","5361850"," right so let me ask you guys let me ask let me ask you guys out there haven't really been"
"5361850","5366770"," paying attention at all to the to the chat I've been trying to trade myself here in the background"
"5367950","5373990"," but I do want to ask you guys out there what you think about the fall this morning a couple"
"5373990","5379850"," things I guess would be first off the fall this morning the impact of this fall if you were to"
"5379850","5384630"," look at the fall this morning on a much larger chart let's say you look at a one-year chart"
"5384630","5392630"," this is significant right this leaves a mark we haven't seen moves like this since at least 2020"
"5392630","5401650"," and then prior to that the last significant move oh boy did they like today the measured move 2018"
"5401650","5409790"," would be another significant move like we had today this one's going to sit out sit out"
"5409790","5417270"," specifically on a chart right this is not a move that you want to see this quickly this is a"
"5417270","5423310"," five-day move well we did start up back here at 479 but we had a nice little pump but"
"5423310","5429490"," this capitulation move and that was back on December 31st I guess you could say it took a month for"
"5429490","5436210"," us to get here it was quite orderly until early last week I want to say right like Wednesday or"
"5436210","5445710"," Thursday and it's continuing now my concern at this pace is the pace of the of the move this"
"5445710","5454790"," morning there's real damage done to the market at this point so I have some questions about that I"
"5454790","5459650"," want to know what you guys think about the time that it took for us to get where we are"
"5459650","5467870"," this morning and its implications I did measure some moves to compare and see if we made a move"
"5467870","5476670"," down today to the 428 level in the past and it was very rare and on those rare occasions when"
"5476670","5484030"," it has happened it did leave a mark you know it's like you get punched in the face or you"
"5484030","5488770"," like it's I got how do I look at it like if you were a dry drywall or a painter"
"5488770","5495470"," or construction worker and you worked for 10 years versus if you got hit by a car right you're"
"5495470","5500150"," going to feel the car hitting you right away whereas some guy that's working a blue colored job"
"5500150","5505970"," it's going to take five or ten years to feel it I'm trying to relate this to an easy to"
"5505970","5512430"," an easy way that I guess this morning I did see some more spy puts coming in right now spy"
"5512430","5522030"," 124 424 425 p 425 thousand dollars SQQ Q calls January"
"5522030","5531950"," 28 250 thousand dollars in calls QQ Q 2018 February 18 320 p for 300 thousand"

"5541550","5546750"," this is a from everything I've seen in the past when I was trying to measure this stuff out here"
"5546750","5554610"," on previous events when we move this quickly I want you to know that the implications are not good"
"5554610","5578570"," we typically do not snap back like we normally would it's leaving"
"5578570","5588340"," a market my pants I don't I don't know I don't believe the news right now I'm not really paying"
"5588340","5595500"," too much of time I'm paying some attention to the news but not in context of the market I kind"
"5595500","5600580"," of have my main street hat on with the news currently I'm not really paying too much attention to"
"5600580","5606520"," the news we know this is going to happen we know that we had a price target of 428 well"
"5606520","5613220"," we knew we had a price target of 428 heading into February we knew the bank spot to for well"
"5613220","5622800"," they bought lower than 428 so this isn't unexpected in any real way but the acceleration of it"
"5622800","5629060"," is is a surprise to me I figured that we would have a snapback play today into the open then"
"5629060","5638340"," we would possibly trade down into FOMC and then continue to trade down after or up to earnings the"
"5638340","5645060"," outlier tail risk that I saw into this morning had more to do with and it's in the video last"
"5645060","5654100"," night I've actually written down right here and the real problem is if the market panics and we"
"5654100","5661700"," talked about me Kevin last night that he was kind of loose out of his out of his positioning right"
"5661700","5667380"," he was free to do what he wanted at that point and the real problem was that does he create"
"5667380","5674180"," panic on the retail side of the market with these other pumpers that are out there we talked last"
"5674180","5680980"," night about small hedge funds that tried to buy the market on Friday because they were upside down"
"5680980","5687780"," in positions they were telling you that they were going to buy the PayPal and Nike and all these"

"5695180","5701400"," force but is a force if they get their shit together which this morning looks like they did to me"
"5701400","5710220"," to me it looks like these small hedge funds got got got caught last week upside down and what they"
"5710220","5718600"," thought was places to hide that they tried to buy the dip on Friday into Monday and hopefully trade"
"5718600","5727160"," off of a snapback but then when you have retail panicking and then you watch it this morning in pre "

"17041650","17050890"," no way shape or form are we in a bear trap anything like that nothing bullish about this market"
"17050890","17061070"," nothing bullish about the damage that was done to this market in the course of the past month and I"
"17061070","17065410"," would warn you matter of fact I'll try I don't know if I can't at the other day today remind"
"17065410","17073570"," me and I'll show you relative the move that was made this past month to previous moments in history"
"17073570","17080690"," and sometimes there's a nice little pull up could see like a nice little snapback trade but the"
"17080690","17090650"," following trade that comes after it is typically huge 15 20 30 move down I can't call"
"17090650","17096770"," that quite yet I need to do some research today and make sure I got this right I did this"
"17096770","17102910"," before this past weekend and it showed something like that happening so there should be a move"
"17102910","17112780"," higher but at the same time there should be a giant move down at some point another giant move down"
"17161500","17168360"," yes that's there's an answer to the bull saying no you're not getting the 435 you're lucky that you"
"17168360","17177770"," got the 432 84 so just straight this is straight like 10 20 million dollars just telling you uh"
"17177770","17202360"," GTFO talk"
"17202360","17208760"," about how is shop grain right now well so you guys we've been talking about we've been talking"
"17208760","17214420"," about shops since last uh since last week shop you want to be watching like so like apple's got a"
"17214420","17218900"," lot of traffic in it has a lot of ice has a lot of levels to it it's going to"
"17218900","17224240"," take a lot to trade apple down but you look at some of these companies you look like shopify you"
"17224240","17233580"," look at Amazon you really want to be watching those companies as we trade down to lower support"
"17233580","17240900"," levels because they'll be the tell that the market is going to crash so it's not like hey we're"
"17240900","17245660"," saying yeah the market's gonna crash but if it's going to crash you want to be watching those"
"17245660","17251600"," companies you want to be watching not so much the apples gonna be watching like the shopify is"
"17251600","17257840"," gonna be watching the amazon's because if they're buying it like today today watching shopify get"
"17257840","17265020"," bought down at 780 means that banks are still interested in the market it still says we have a"
"17265020","17271620"," bottom to this market if you see them let if they cut loose a shopify or if they cut loose"
"17271620","17277840"," in amazon then you know that some guy big up high or some woman up high is saying no pull"
"17277840","17285270"," the plug on the entire market and it's a little bit clearer to see that in companies like shopify"
"17285270","17292650"," so it's easier to see the moves that can be made and you know another thing too is you know"
"17292650","17300730"," so shopify is traded back to may of 2020 today so if they trade back to march let's say of"
"17300730","17310550"," 2020 put us right around 400 right so you were kind of looking for all those telltales like"
"17310550","17317430"," telltales on a on a ship right if you're sailing a boat they have these little cloth pieces strips"
"17317430","17324490"," that hang off a sail and you get the wind coming from one way but you're really looking to see"
"17324490","17329730"," up higher where the wind actually is and the telltales will tell you if you have enough loft in"
"17329730","17335310"," your sails and if if you're heading in the right direction or not and so we use those we use"
"17335310","17343790"," tickers like shopify for that so spy just got pimped slapped down that is an indicator that we are"
"17343790","17361720"," not bullish right by that flow that came in it's"
"17361720","17368960"," my tell because there isn't there's a because the because the banks like to hide money in certain"
"17368960","17377300"," tickers and they don't really worry too much about them like if you go into like Amazon right let's"
"17377300","17380520"," look at let's look at an apple real quick we'll look we'll do this quickly I want to show you"
"17380520","17387080"," guys that guys this so here okay let's look at apple real quick let's show the difference let's try"
"17387080","17393120"," I thought tried that I was showing this earlier but you know the internet connects all of us right"
"17393120","17399640"," everybody wants to trade apple everybody wants to trade Tesla everybody wants to trade certain"
"17399640","17409180"," tickers right and so it's it's kind of hard to see in an apple is this a bottom and apple"
"17409180","17415000"," is the top of an apple because everyone's buying apple constantly everybody when you look at an"
"17415000","17420180"," apple you'll see multiple layers of ice right you'll see these see all this color here so these are"
"17420180","17425580"," dark right here these are lighter colored and so we're going to look at apple real quick and i'll"
"17425580","17433840"," show you it's a little bit more deceitful when you're trying to track an apple versus a ticker that"
"17435000","17445400"," the banks trade so you see what's traffic in here with apple it's kind of messy it"
"17445400","17453080"," says light areas here light areas here and light areas here all this stuff's called ice right and"
"17453080","17456680"," uh less of it today than there has been the past it's not a good day to be looking at"
"17456680","17462500"," apple but generally speak when you look at an apple or a retail favorite ticker we got like some"
"17462500","17467420"," old man Jones at home and he's telling his wife that he owns apple and his buddies that he owns"
"17467420","17474860"," apple and so it's white area here yellow area here all this kind of nonsense here right these are"
"17474860","17481340"," all buyers sellers and there's just tons of them it's like it'd be difficult to see uh what this"
"17481340","17486780"," means in context to the overall health of the market but when you look at a company like Shopify"
"17488860","17494240"," now this is a place that the banks hide out hey hide out in right they hide out in Shopify"
"17494240","17500900"," where retail doesn't trade at that frequently Amazon to an extent is like that as well you get some"
"17500900","17510560"," retail trades uh Amazon but not as many as you think so when you look at a Shopify you're going"
"17510560","17514680"," to notice a lot of black area in here not a lot of white and blue areas not a lot"
"17514680","17522340"," of yellow areas you're going to see that it's not traded it's done it's very light trading in"
"17522340","17531040"," Shopify these are mostly banks that are trading Shopify so it gives a little bit better idea as to"
"17531040","17536920"," the general health of the market you see how this is so lightly traded you don't you just don't see"
"17536920","17544160"," retail trading this this gives a little bit of a clear picture as to what what big holders are"
"17544160","17554000"," doing in this market and so let's look at Shopify real quick because they're it's important so"
"17554000","17563970"," if you let's take a look below Shopify see"
"17563970","17572210"," all this dark space down here right the Shopify can make big moves in the market selling there's"
"17572210","17578150"," not a lot of support in here so dark it is but you will see the banks kick in at"
"17578150","17588080"," certain levels you know it's very clean right 80780"
"17588080","17594840"," so if you see a break below this area down here you start to say what where is the next"
"17594840","17600920"," stop right and the next stop is 750 you see the difference in color to this like a light yellow"
"17600920","17605860"," this is a darker red this is serious red because hey we're down here to buy this dip at all"
"17605860","17610900"," times and so you want to say well if Shopify falls to 750 where does that take us on the"
"17610900","17616740"," spy you do a mathematical calculation for how much it weighs into the spy and into the cues start"
"17616740","17622640"," to look below here it's 700 not as much support down here right 750 a ton of support but not"
"17622640","17629380"," so much so they're betting on us not going any deeper than 750 on Shopify now if we had a"
"17629380","17634460"," solid market moment or come to come to daddy moment or something like that where do they really"
"17634460","17638740"," going to where they really going to buy it you know you can start to see it down here 685"
"17638740","17645740"," it's just kicked in today too now so there's some concern there's someone out there there's some"
"17645740","17651220"," banker that said yeah we could sell this market down to 685 we're going to put a bid in just"
"17651220","17658720"," in case we drop down here maybe a bit lucky and so I use Shopify as one of those about"
"17658720","17664360"," bellwethers one of those telltales for the market find out where they're willing to get along and"
"17664360","17674160"," Shopify where they think we could possibly fall that's 625 that's a scary one"
"17674160","17685060"," too knowing that there's a bank sitting there ready to buy that dip 625"
"17685060","17693980"," 685 pretty low do I think we get down there probably not probably get down to this 685 at the"
"17693980","17700800"," worst it looks like even today someone said that they said as a chance we sell down to 685 into"
"17701440","17707900"," February much that doesn't mean it's going to happen but it is you know these are telltale signs"
"17707900","17712180"," these are things that you're looking for while the market is selling to give you a clear insight"
"17712180","17722020"," into it's one more tool your big huge toolbox that I'm trying to see how unhealthy the market is"
"17722020","17730560"," I was watching REITs earlier today watching energy earlier today you want to see like do they start"
"17730560","17743200"," selling off they's holding up while we're selling down uh financials all"
"17743200","17749740"," those important to be watching when we're making these big moves down because you probably see that"
"17749740","17757160"," probably you can see in the background if they're selling the market down if they're if they're"
"17757160","17764480"," going to crash the market you'll see it bonds too you'll see it in gold metals you'll see metals"
"17764480","17774230"," start crashing start to see like uh instead of a uh divergence in CLT and uh"
"17776090","17783890"," tech you'll see both start crashing same time it's a bunch of different shape you can look at see"
"17783890","17793830"," how bad it is in the background watching more puts come in jets spy million dollar puts on apple"
"17793830","17801190"," right now February 18th 160p and you know what this is telling you right everybody everybody's got"
"17801190","17810490"," in February 18th the RTY is flat on the day"
"17810490","17820290"," so the"
"17820290","17825970"," market is definitely pinned I can tell you that and it's pinned with the implication that we trade"
"17825970","17833270"," down into February my price target is going to be about 400 right now 408 I think I don't know"
"17833270","17852260"," though if it happens in February it might take longer into March maybe so"
"17852260","17859320"," are we flat right now so what we did is we ended up watching the rest of the day today"
"17859320","17864840"," I let this load up I think I've got like a week and a half or two weeks that says"
"17864840","17869700"," that I've I'm say I've got eight or eight gigs of information that I got to load up into this"
"17869700","17877800"," program right now I think after I think at the dump book map today and and reloaded fresh for"
"17877800","17887740"," tomorrow yeah core cross assay correlations approaching one is a"
"17887740","17900110"," big telltale sign Emerson"
"17900110","17908250"," there was just a heads up Emerson that a whole slew of IWM hedging came in right at the top"
"17908250","17917540"," there on that bounce at the top on IWM for"
"17917540","17927960"," you're still listening Emerson it was February 18th 189 P looks"
"17927960","17936560"," like yeah roughly that 189 P February 18th I have not seen any"
"17936560","17946520"," any calls that are outside of a day trade on the market saw Bruno I shouldn't say that"
"17946520","17956320"," I saw some calls on the spy of note that were dated where did I"
"17956320","17964300"," see those some decent size on some spy calls but they were far dated but it looked like they were"
"17964300","17972800"," still day trades that makes any sense like I see like February 18th 350 C for a million dollars on"
"17972800","17982220"," Qs uh I don't know if that's just hedging though this so this is all looking inverse to me so"
"17982900","17989520"," like all this flow that's in the market right now all of it like even the way it's acting it's"
"17989520","17997520"," all inverse of a normal bull market so nothing is saying so if you're bull to me I know most"
"17997520","18003040"," of us are trained to be bulls so if you're looking at all of the the way that it's trading"
"18003040","18009140"," the way everything is happening here it's just inverse like this this middle the afternoon look"
"18009140","18014440"," this is would you typically see this inverse where we'd trade down slightly through the middle the"
"18014440","18021000"," afternoon and we'd trade up into the close and uh you know and then you'd get your nice rip in"
"18021000","18028960"," the morning this all looks like just the inverse of the bull market right meaning there are outlier"
"18028960","18038280"," events in this but generally speaking even the flow the rejections are just like hard supports when"
"18038280","18045060"," we're on our way up we're getting hard rejections like we will trade we just snapped back right"
"18045060","18053500"," real quick to 432 435 but you know this is a hard resistance right now this is proving to be"
"18053500","18058960"," a hard resistance this would be like a hard support if we were heading up uh we're bouncing off and"
"18058960","18063940"," they're waiting for more uh buyers to step in if we were heading up this is just waiting for more"
"18063940","18072480"," sellers to step in so we can make another run lower you can intraday intraday trade it because"
"18072480","18078220"," there's more money in the call side believe it or not in the put side uh it's another discussion"
"18078220","18086260"," for another time but at the same time uh you're just waiting for more and more now puts the show"
"18086260","18095900"," up then they are right"
"18095900","18105380"," now 408 2.9 million dollars and puts in the spy"
"18108040","18119440"," uh at 230 spy puts came in 218 408 710 000 dollars so"
"18119440","18125040"," no matter where we are right here uh this is just that you turn your monitor upside down it's just"
"18125040","18131300"," like a bull run uh but the inverse you're gonna bounce up here you got bears stepping back in to"
"18131300","18140880"," take this lower uh ultimately the target the price target below is 408 408 yeah"
"18144560","18159780"," yeah and there's now hedging coming into spy so i just want you to know that uh yeah everything"
"18159780","18168890"," is being liquidated they're gonna get more expensive too you're gonna see puts get way way more"
"18168890","18176970"," expensive so if you're lucky if you're lucky hopefully we'll trade up to this 435 or neared again"
"18177590","18184510"," this 434 so if we can trade up here one more time drive yourself some puts strap in if you"
"18184510","18191570"," can't afford puts because you're a poor trader you can always buy uh put spreads it's actually i"
"18191570","18197890"," have plenty of money to trade and i like trade and put spreads it leaves uh it leaves the erratic"
"18197890","18202450"," movements of the market out of the way and when you get a nice big giant swing down you can"
"18202450","18209810"," close them out make some money they're safer they don't pay as well sometimes uh but they still pay"
"18209810","18221010"," very well exactly upward pullbacks uh"
"18221010","18243750"," but we are with no way shape or form are we uh polish can"
"18243750","18278010"," i enter multiple lines on youtube chat i don't know a lot"
"18290650","18294850"," of the trades if any guys are looking at how to make trades a lot of the trades that i'll"
"18294850","18301630"," take is uh so especially right now past few weeks what i'll do is i'll take uh put spread right"
"18301630","18307350"," uh so here's a prime example for some of you guys out there learn you can take a put spread"
"18307350","18315390"," right take it anywhere from a week two weeks three weeks out uh and then you supplement with cheap"
"18315390","18323950"," calls on the opposite side of that trade in case we do have uh a trade higher that those will"
"18323950","18333900"," print for you uh it's like it's kind of a straddle but even right here where"
"18333900","18340320"," we are you can put a put spread on into february 18th and then each day if you find a"
"18340320","18345560"," low you buy some uh call some just some cheap 10 cent calls or whatever and if it trades higher"
"18345560","18350440"," you get paid if it you doesn't you're losing 10 cents on that trade you know let's say you're"
"18350440","18356280"," taking a trade that costs you a dollar just as an example you take a put trade uh that cost"
"18356280","18362740"," you a dollar and then just as some insurance in the background you spend another 10 cents so if you"
"18362740","18368600"," let's say you take a put spread cost you a dollar let's say you spend i don't know 10 grand"
"18368600","18374680"," in that trade right let's say just let's just say you spend 10 dollars on that trade then spend"
"18374680","18384620"," another 10 cents on a long uh call out or excuse me um outside the money 10 cents uh calls"
"18384620","18391240"," right zero dates one dates three dates and if the market goes up you paid for your put spread if"
"18391240","18397140"," the market goes down uh you lose the 10 cents but you still make whatever that spread would have"
"18397140","18405340"," paid you if that makes sense uh and if if it had gone up uh you'd make stupid money on"
"18405340","18410800"," those 10 cent calls and more than likely would come back down to print your put spread again so"
"18410800","18415080"," they usually end up printing one way or another they're almost a free trade not quite but close to"
"18415080","18424470"," a free trade so it doesn't really matter which way the market moves you'll print either way and you"
"18424470","18430410"," can just mathematically calculate and put on paper and figure out uh what that move or how that how"
"18430410","18439640"," that uh trade pays now i need to do it so what i did was you don't have to do"
"18439640","18447300"," is i just keep forgetting so my wife has an account i had my wife make an account on uh"
"18447300","18454760"," whatever the fuck that program is on options.ai so i need to just move some money over to it"
"18458260","18464060"," they need to move some money over to it so that uh can trade and account with or that account"
"18464060","18474360"," specifically for just you guys i need to"
"18474360","18480120"," keep it separate and the one problem with that uh company is that i can't have multiple accounts on"
"18480120","18484840"," one i can only have like one account so i had to ask my wife to make an account they"
"18484840","18488540"," just need to switch they just need to transfer some money and just haven't done it to be honest"
"18488540","18498440"," with you for no other reason i just haven't done it i gotta do a"
"18498440","18506480"," spread videos with you guys watching more puts come in right now bidu puts february 18th 125p spy"
"18506480","18515440"," puts 124 420p pfe puts nine nine thousand dollars on january 28th 47p s bucks"

"21212800","21220220"," high the snapback trade is there's damage done to our market uh there are a few positives to say"
"21220220","21228560"," today seeing Shopify trade down to uh four seventy i was not a four six excuse me i'm misspeaking"
"21228560","21237260"," here seeing uh Shopify trade down to 780 today was a positive sign for a market reversal but again"
"21237260","21243840"," it's the same question right the question becomes do you feel comfortable as a bull taking this"
"21243840","21251380"," market long at 430 or even 420 and my answer to that is no as a bull it's just a"
"21251380","21257420"," matter of damage as a bull it's just a matter of time i would take this market higher as a"
"21257420","21264700"," bull with some confidence if we traded down to 400 or anything less anything 400 or less would be"
"21264700","21271420"," confident with trading this market even like SQ is kind of close to where it should be but still"
"21271420","21279000"," not quite there right uh and then the banks right now are hedging lower there are no calls coming"
"21279000","21288700"," in uh to 480 there's no call hedges for for June to 480 there's no like 10 million dollar blocks"

"21303300","21310860"," trade all day long but for right now the trade is lower the banks are trading this lower they can"
"21310860","21317320"," be wrong at times but i tend to trade with the banks not with retail i seem to win more"
"21317320","21322700"," often when i trade with the banks i'll take longs right now but i have to put protection on while"
"21322700","21329140"," i'm taking them and i have to make sure that i'm taking the the meat of my trade is into"

"21339080","21364930"," when those trades like print or not and then day trade long whenever i can now so"
"21364930","21371050"," like put spreads don't matter so the key behind a put spread is it doesn't fucking matter if it"
"21371050","21375750"," trades up or down the only thing the matter or not i guess it does matter for trades down because"
"21375750","21383970"," they print but it it doesn't affect whether those put spreads print that's the beauty of it we"
"21383970","21390170"," could trade up tomorrow to 440 or 450 and if we still head down to 408 they'll end up printing"
"21390170","21395050"," and if they do them in the money here at 430 let's say at this bell let's say we trade"
"21395050","21401050"," up into this bell like 435 and i just take an end the money put spread that expires on the"
"21401050","21406590"," 18th at 435 that there's a pretty fair chance to get a print so what i'll do is just leave"
"21406590","21417570"," them in the uh leave them in the background and let them print down the road yeah"
"21417570","21422290"," i don't know as a bull i'm not i'm not a my long view of this market is that i'm"
"21422290","21432230"," not willing to take this market long at 434 at 450 it has to come down slightly more"
"21432230","21442070"," at least 400 and on the on that same note right uh you've got a correction that's taking place that"
"21442070","21446450"," is knocking down these companies all of these companies are selling the fucking news this week"
"21446450","21452750"," every single one of them apple tesla microsoft doesn't matter who they are none of these companies"
"21452750","21458590"," are going to be giving you guidance that's going to say we're going to fucking whatever you know"
"21458590","21462750"," apple's not going to tell you they're going to 200 or 300 they don't say that but you know that"
"21462750","21468070"," their valuation should be higher that's not what they're going to tell you this week it's the same"
"21468070","21473190"," thing as what Netflix said that flicks is a good bell weather there's going to be more panic in the"
"21473190","21480890"," market and i don't give a fine fuck where we trade i don't believe for a second that we're going"
"21480890","21490620"," higher i don't believe for a second that's when they have to tell the truth that's the key that you"
"21490620","21496140"," have to know is that some of you know this some of you don't there's only four times a year"
"21496140","21501840"," that a company has to tell you the truth and that is during their earnings reports if they don't"
"21501840","21509420"," it's a fucking felony they will arrest you and throw your ass in jail the market the banks will not"
"21509420","21516900"," trade you ever again because of lies right it's one of the one of the only golden rules in this"
"21516900","21525700"," in any market is that the ceo's cfo's of these companies are held to the iron four times a year"
"21525700","21530860"," and so they have to give you the time they have to tell you the truth whether they read or"
"21530860","21540340"," read or or um like like a great example is Samuel Adams Samuel Adams did not update investors on"
"21540340","21547660"," their guidance and they traded that ship down to the depths of hell and so if you don't if you're"
"21547660","21555620"," not forthcoming in your earnings reports and your guidance statements um then and they find out"
"21555620","21560380"," later on or you know anything that kind of stuff uh it's really bad for a company so i don't"
"21560380","21565320"," think i think this is the perfect opportunity for a company if i was a company and we we've been"
"21565320","21571420"," making bank for a year two years just cranking it's a perfect opportunity to dump your baggage you"
"21571420","21575720"," don't want to dump your baggage uh after a fall you want to pick the right time to do it"
"21575720","21581840"," so you dump all your baggage clean the slate clean it all off real nice and then you come back"
"21581840","21586520"," to make money another day there's a time to take profit off the table this is that time for us"
"21586520","21590740"," to take profit off the table it's time for bulls take profit off the table it's the time for"
"21590740","21596680"," companies to take profit off the table anything else would be would be kind of crazy although you"
"21596680","21601480"," know like a Tesla sure maybe they do split their stock at their ER something wild that nobody knows"
"21601480","21609340"," but generally speaking you have to have the idea in your mind that everything adds up to this"
"21609340","21617540"," market selling down everything every single thing is stacked against you as a bull right now i'm a"
"21617540","21623100"," bull and everything is stacked against me as a bull right now no matter where we trade up to right"
"21623100","21630480"," now okay doesn't we we normally sell in a bull market we normally sell for profit every er season"
"21630480","21635960"," that's positive and we're just not in that bull market right now right and we're we we have some"
"21635960","21645380"," damage done right now so even if we profit will be taken just generally we take profits off of"
"21645380","21650700"," earnings even if it takes a week or a month or two we're seasonally in a downtime of the year"
"21650700","21655940"," there's just too much stacked up where you say everything's gonna be fine market's gonna be fine"
"21655940","21666890"," now we will trade down it's not even a question of if uh no not"
"21666890","21670590"," really they don't really they really they really can't tell selective truths when they tell"

"23960620","23968040"," up crushing a gap up tomorrow at minimum it should stop a gap up into tomorrow if the dealers have"
"23968040","23977770"," to hedge all of these spy and iwm puts i don't i don't i can't tell you the exact"
"23977770","23983230"," mechanics of it heading into the clothes here just yet uh i know that we've got a ton of puts"
"23983230","23999600"," rolling off tonight man"
"23999600","24016940"," relentless i got five five more minutes left to make a decision if i'm gonna yeah"
"24016940","24027040"," iwm had a bunch of calls come through before the bell i don't know"
"24027040","24035440"," ibm i've said that now twice i'm mistaken my verbiage ibm had a ton of calls come in before the"
"24035440","24073940"," before the bell ibm's now cranking up to 137 49 ibm"
"24073940","24164480"," up almost 7% after the bell it"
"24164480","24172460"," does look like after the bell that even with these puts coming in i'm tracking 445s right now"
"24172460","24182100"," 445c's expiring on the 26th and even with the weakness after the bell there is premium"
"24182100","24189780"," kicking in on spy calls they were down to like 265 or something like that uh right at the bell"
"24189780","24199400"," now they're up to 305 306 there's a lot of premium kick on the long side into tomorrow but it"
"24199400","24208860"," implies that we're going to move up or even gap up tomorrow just a heads up into the last couple"
"24208860","24231200"," minutes here in the trade and"
"24231200","24241040"," the expectation would be if there would be a gap tomorrow into the open to 445 unless something"
"24241040","24285800"," else happens now they're up to 321 into the last minute of trading yeah"
"24285800","24290920"," so while the market trades higher into a couple things of mechanics wise i want to talk to guys"
"24290920","24297660"," about before we end the broadcast so into this last minute today there was a huge kick on premium"
"24297660","24307140"," on calls the last 15 minutes from four o'clock to 415 huge kick massive premium on calls even"
"24307140","24313200"," after the bell before the bell after the bell normally they'll see them come down and they didn't"
"24313200","24319120"," they kept going up ended they went straight up into the 415 hour now with that said uh there was"
"24319120","24323740"," some major hedging still put on the market into the bell as well and i took some more hedging on"
"24324380","24333060"," today at the end of the day to account for this trade down into February 18th so i want to"
"24333060","24339480"," know if you guys think that this bullishness is brief is this just something that takes place for"
"24339480","24344780"," the next two or three days then we trade back down take profit and trade down to 400 where we"
"24344780","24349580"," where we stabilize the market for the next three to four days or do you think it just starts"
"24349580","24367020"," selling off tomorrow uh what's your what's your thought process overnight because"
"24367020","24374990"," underneath the surface there's a bet against the market still yeah i've had some if you look at my"
"24374990","24384770"," trading today it's been all over the place multiple hundred"
"24384770","24392330"," percent trades back and forth up and down today in this market period puts printing calls printing"
"24392330","24399090"," puts printing i probably printed calls so i probably i think i have two or three put trades one"
"24399090","24405230"," that i have still open i have at least six to seven call trades i'm gonna have to look back"
"24405230","24415180"," look on my uh history today it's a"
"24415180","24421880"," head fake i'm holding spreads dump post f um c vix drop ten points intraday while i was slowly"
"24421880","24426860"," burned down some more thought of all cross-ready probably hit up over half the rally with that big"
"24426860","24432440"," money is hugely negative brief very brief god knows at this point it's been a wild day hands down"
"24432440","24442930"," this has been one of the wildest days uh that i've traded in many many many moons gap"
"24442930","24452650"," up 20 to 40 points my off my ass off yeah so so we'll see into tomorrow"
"24452650","24460350"," i'm interested to see if we still gap up i think we gap up to 450 tomorrow but i'm the"
"24460350","24466710"," only thing that makes me hesitant of that is the last bit of of puts that came in could stifle"
"24466710","24474070"," the gap up somewhat tomorrow or flatten it there is one positive thing and that is the amount of"
"24474070","24482590"," puts that expired today at the bell that could lead to at least 445 is a gap up tomorrow the"
"24482590","24499870"," only thing against that is those iwm puts and those spy puts after the bell that came in can't"
"24499870","24509860"," see that far out yeah i think there's a i think there's a possibility of a gap"
"24509860","24515380"," up there's some weird interplay in the market right now you've got uh i would have said i would"
"24515380","24521220"," have i would have given it a 70 to 80 percent chance of a gap up until those those last"
"24521220","24528940"," little puts came in maybe spy gaps up but iwm doesn't maybe q's has the best chance of gap up"
"24528940","24536180"," tomorrow i guess i put it that way right best chance of gap up q's uh second chance maybe slightly"
"24536180","24548000"," stifled would be spy iwm is going to be tough to gap up tough not saying it can't happen but"
"24548000","24557040"," it's going to be tough the spy put rollover was huge huge almost 400,000 inputs rolling off today"
