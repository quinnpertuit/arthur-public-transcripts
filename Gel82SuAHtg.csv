"Gel82SuAHtg","890240","894240"," So if you're not in not in our discord I don't really know what you're talking about."
"Gel82SuAHtg","895240","900240"," You're saying you needed something some reason to join it. I'll be honest at this point."
"Gel82SuAHtg","900240","912240"," I like the small group and discord. I kind of dig it. This reminds me of the discord is nice to be a part of where people were serious they were in their trade and hope that you can join us in there if you make that decision."

"Gel82SuAHtg","931240","939240"," Hold on one second. Where's that Jim's getting coffee going to get rid of that? Oh, no, close. What's that? Oh, yeah, baby."
"Gel82SuAHtg","939240","946240"," Oh, the eye patch. We got the eye patch."
"Gel82SuAHtg","946240","949240"," We put that coffee break thing away right now."
"Gel82SuAHtg","950240","960240"," So this morning setting up. Excuse me. Look at my voice back. I'm going to lose my voice today. Guaranteed."
"Gel82SuAHtg","960240","963240"," Coffee time, baby."
"Gel82SuAHtg","963240","970240"," So David was just speaking about what to expect off the opening bell this morning, right? Here's a little chart here for SPY."
"Gel82SuAHtg","970240","976240"," We have the initial squeeze off the off the news this morning for PCE, right?"
"Gel82SuAHtg","976240","983240"," We also know that if you're a if you're a day trader, you already know, right? This setup right here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","983240","991240"," As long as we stay above the one minute trigger, we can go up there and take out all of these stops up here, these big yellow boxes to the upside."
"Gel82SuAHtg","991240","1003240"," But you always know that whatever happens in pre market, you love to see it come back and retrace all of that move in cash market and then begin to move higher or a move lower."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1003240","1011240"," So for myself setting up for this open here, I'm going to tell you that I expect a quick squeeze off the opening bell."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1011240","1020240"," Mostly due to I don't have you open the shorts on out of you. There's going to be some panic on this open in my view from people trying to get out."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1020240","1028240"," And not only that, the hedge that's on the market once they're once we know once or once dealers no longer have to hedge that they will exit."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1028240","1034240"," There could be some panic on this opening bell. I would like to see if it was me in the next we got four minutes left."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1034240","1043240"," I would love to see a quick squeeze up with a bit more pain, some panic up here, and then some kind of retrace down below."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1043240","1048240"," And this is where I'm going to be looking to enter somewhere in here and some kind of retest down below."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1048240","1056240"," So that's what I'm looking for on the opening bell. If you have different ideas, if you're like a cap, I think we're going to start selling immediately off the open bell."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1056240","1069240"," I see that happening as well. I'm not anti that either. So my trade for today, if I had one is going to be right down here in this little zone right here 50589 possibly 506 64 hold all this stuff."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1069240","1075240"," And look for some continuation into Friday. We've had a mostly down week this week too."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1075240","1082240"," So if all this ball rolls off the market, I mean, we have some we have speakers right that could tamper some of this."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1082240","1097240"," So we have to be careful of that. We begin. I want you to say this to you. We spend down right. If we're going to ride up into this Friday, like we've sold off a lot of Fridays, we might not do that this Friday, but saying all of this right now."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1097240","1098240"," Okay."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1098240","1103240"," Keep your tools in front at moments like this."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1103240","1117240"," Do not abandon the things that we teach you here in the show if we say if prices above the one and five, you get a bull cross. You trade it. You see price go down below. You see a bear cross come over you in one and five minute."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1117240","1127240"," And we're heading down towards the early trigger. You trade it. Regardless of what you're being fed out there on Fintuit Bloomberg CNBC. It doesn't really matter."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1127240","1141240"," It really matters is price action. You and I are price action traders. It's all that ever matters. So even with me giving this pre market speech right always price action 100%. Okay."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1141240","1152240"," So we'll watch this open right now. We've got two minutes left. And I'm going to switch over to the main screen here for you. We get rid of some of this stuff here for a moment."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1152240","1157240"," This morning."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1157240","1159240"," This morning."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1159240","1170240"," I have some questions for you too in the chat if you can answer these questions for me. Hold on. What do I got going on? Give me a second here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1170240","1175240"," Oh yeah. There we go. Bring that over there."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1175240","1192240"," That right now. See that right down there. Do you guys do you guys want me to try Bloomberg news during the day rather than CNBC. I've heard some people ask me. Hey do you want to try to play Bloomberg rather than CNBC."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1192240","1202240"," Let me know in the chat your thoughts on on Bloomberg news during the morning or daytime versus listening to CNBC."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1202240","1206240"," I'd like to get your opinions on that this morning."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1206240","1213240"," Down below as well. I've got the for this morning for charts. I have IWM up."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1213240","1221240"," I've got IWM SPX. I'll update that gamma for you this morning. Right now we'll take care of the gamma so you can see the gamma profile."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1221240","1229240"," I've got eBay Tesla QQQ beyond meets Apple and UNH."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1229240","1237240"," So we'll take a look at what we'll keep those up this morning. If you have any requests for a different ticker let me know so that I can change out these tickers."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1237240","1242240"," If you want something new this morning and we're going to do SPX gamma right now."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1242240","1250240"," It's going to be just one moment here and we'll put that up for you. We'll get that updated and check out where we are in relation to gamma."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1250240","1260240"," By the way if you're a you're a pro trader you get that every morning from us all of your gamma stuff every morning what you need to know."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1260240","1269240"," Gamma flip maintained at 50 40 this morning. No change in that."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1269240","1274240"," Let's take a peek and see if there's any major changes to gamma this morning."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1274240","1279240"," Hold on one second here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1279240","1283240"," See if we get any development to the upside."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1283240","1287240"," Not seeing anything changing here let's take a peek to the upside right now."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1287240","1295240"," We are now opening up that squeeze going up pay attention to the chart down below right now I want you to see something here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1295240","1303240"," Okay come on down with me down here and I want you to look I want you at home I want you to snap a line at 5100."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1303240","1309240"," You could do a comparison chart with spy and SPX snap a line on 5100."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1309240","1314240"," There should be some resistance at 5100 and SPX."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1314240","1317240"," It doesn't matter if we break above it."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1317240","1328240"," But it does matter that you're exiting your longs around there and then trying to jump back on again if it's a matter of consolidation and not rejection above it 5100."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1328240","1334240"," Just keep your eyes on this 5100 this morning as a place for the market to turn around."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1334240","1341240"," How's my crayon doing this morning so far."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1341240","1346240"," How's my crayon doing this morning so far is that crayon okay for you out there."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1346240","1354240"," Is that crayon okay for you let me know in the chat."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1354240","1364240"," Ebay squeezing up right now."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1364240","1366240"," You can see this from yesterday."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1366240","1377240"," Here's eBay nice little squeeze looking for a back test again continuation to the upside right now for eBay."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1377240","1383240"," How are you doing out there and discord this morning by the way."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1383240","1388240"," Sorry I'll leave that up for you right now."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1388240","1397240"," All right so we've got the gamma done for SPX you know about 5100 as we approach 5100 even if we go up there."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1397240","1403240"," That's your hands off right you let the squeeze jump above you let it come back down trade that next level."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1403240","1405240"," Same as usual."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1405240","1410240"," Good morning Jasmine how are you."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1411240","1429240"," That's why I always buy my triangle crayons so they don't roll off the table and if you Marines out there know about triangle crayons right high speed no drag crayons."

"Gel82SuAHtg","1467240","1472240"," I'm not going to do like a hindsight yeah you were a lot wrong or anything like that."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1472240","1486240"," It was always known I think that it was a Heinz not a hindsight but a lot of trade he had a trade on for 500% put spread against small caps which I thought was a good trade even if it burned."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1487240","1496240"," I was like yeah 100 bucks for five you can take that trade five times and you probably do either be flat or doing quite well so."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1496240","1511240"," I'd like to find out from Chase winter this morning if he's going to hold that trade I think it I think it expires on Friday but I'm interested to find out from him what the plan is or he's looking for a pull back to on to get out from the trade or whatever."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1511240","1519240"," Chase let us know don't like seeing you lose either brother because I know you win a ton so let us know man."

"Gel82SuAHtg","1562240","1567240"," Good morning out there how y'all doing."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1567240","1579240"," Yeah if you're if you're a long puts right now but did you the I mean puts were dirt cheap too right puts were pretty what do we say yesterday we said."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1580240","1596240"," Next Friday and puts for we said yesterday I think by calls dated for next Friday right and then we said by puts dated for Friday that were like five cents 10 cents 15 cents."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1596240","1606240"," So if we were like at the calls cost you a buck or something or two bucks you're still going to make 90 cents or expect to make let's say you're expecting to make a dollar on a dollar."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1607240","1613240"," And then we said that we don't care if they burn because they're so cheap."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1613240","1618240"," I think that's what the trade I think that's the trade that we talked about yesterday."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1618240","1624240"," All right give me a couple seconds here let me read through your chat and see what your thoughts are on CNBC and Bloomberg."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1624240","1628240"," How about this how about we start by listening to Bloomberg."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1629240","1633240"," How about this how about this how about we start by listening to Bloomberg."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1633240","1634240"," This morning."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1634240","1639240"," If they don't get too much one reason I don't like so I used to listen to Fox business news."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1639240","1650240"," And they started like they started filling a lot of content or time with content that had nothing to do with the markets."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1650240","1656240"," So I was like yeah this is I can't listen to this shit all day long while I'm trading it's like too depressing."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1656240","1662240"," I'm not listening to that stuff and then Bloomberg I thought was going down that same road but I'm not sure."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1662240","1668240"," So we'll try them out this morning during market hours and see how that goes."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1668240","1675240"," Now if you're at home and I'm not speaking or I'm not commenting on the market or interviewing or checking in somewhere."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1675240","1678240"," And I'm not wearing break or something."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1678240","1684240"," From live streaming you don't like listening to Bloomberg or CNBC just mute it."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1684240","1687240"," I will try to do an alert or not an alert."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1687240","1693240"," I'm going to try to do is or not try to do it on this screen specifically."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1693240","1699240"," I'm going to bring up a picture of me to cover my video camera."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1699240","1704240"," So if you see that picture that means you know I'm not here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1704240","1713240"," Right it'll be a visual indicator to you that CNBC is playing the audio or Bloomberg or whatever."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1713240","1718240"," Is playing is playing. So if you're like yeah I don't like listening to that shit you just mute it."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1718240","1727240"," If you see my the picture of me with the eye patch or something if you see that up you know that I'm not blabbing in the background or something like that."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1728240","1733240"," So that should help give you an indicator from actually chatting or not."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1733240","1738240"," Let me get that picture going here really quick hold on here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1738240","1741240"," Let me see if we can find it."

"Gel82SuAHtg","1751240","1756240"," Let me see if I can find a picture here."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1756240","1762240"," I got a picture I can put here so that you know there we go that'll work."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1762240","1767240"," What is that wrong picture."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1767240","1769240"," That'll work right there."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1769240","1772240"," Are you guys want something like this."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1772240","1778240"," Okay you guys probably want to see this instead."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1778240","1783240"," Let's see if that works."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1783240","1785240"," Does that work."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1786240","1788240"," Nope that's not working."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1788240","1793240"," I don't know why that's not working."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1793240","1796240"," Not working."
"Gel82SuAHtg","1796240","1799240"," Yeah we're going to remove this."
