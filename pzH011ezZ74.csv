"7240","8860"," before the film begins."
"83390","84370"," Check 1-2."
"91820","92620"," Good morning. "
"95180","100360"," We'll get right into it this morning so we can just take a couple of things we're going to do."
"104710","107530"," We're going to throw an ad in there if you're just joining us to apologize."
"113620","114900"," Just a second here. "
"130100","130900"," All right."
"131260","134000"," I apologize for being a little late for it."
"134080","135820"," I've got a broken or broken. "
"136160","140900"," That's the tab that I have in the video this morning."
"142360","145780"," I've got a stolen SUV out in front of my house this morning."
"147480","148680"," So I'm like, oh, fuck. "
"151360","152420"," And it's weird."
"152620","153720"," I just put up security camera."
"153940","157860"," I just bought this house and started rewiring it as a smart home. "
"159080","160420"," So I do have cameras outside."
"163530","167350"," I'm not impressed with what the cameras showed late last night."
"167830","169410"," We'll talk about that at some point today. "
"171530","174010"," Okay, so let's see here."
"174950","176470"," So I did leave up."
"176470","182810"," I did chart out the support and resistance levels for this morning. "
"183490","189070"," I did leave the path that I had shown you here yesterday."
"190410","192790"," We're taking some of that path this morning."
"194230","197010"," It's not exact, but it's pretty good to kind of see it, right?"
"197890","200070"," And actually the overnight we dipped kind of low. "
"200510","204970"," I'll try to show you this on ES, what happened in the overnight and the path that we took."
"205130","208950"," We didn't quite get where I wanted to see us get this morning though."
"209610","214490"," So we're not quite getting as high as I expected before we started to sell down. "
"215270","218890"," We'll take a look at that right now as before we do anything else this morning."
"219070","221110"," We'll give people a few minutes to roll in here."
"221910","226650"," So you can let you see that path that we did trade up and then we're trading down at this"
"226650","226930"," point. "
"227810","228830"," Give me a second here."
"231840","233900"," And what I'll do is I'll bring over."
"235660","238360"," The good thing is here we're at some kind of a bottom. "
"239340","240980"," Whether you believe that or not."
"241720","246380"," The title card this morning has a wall of broken clocks on it."
"246620","248240"," That's the title of the program this morning. "
"249500","254700"," We're going to talk about where we should be inside of the selling."
"255500","257779"," How far down we've sold at this point."
"261019","263000"," We've only had two legs down here. "
"263120","264060"," I'll show you both."
"265000","267260"," So somewhere in here we knew this was going to roll over here."
"267980","271680"," But we did have this one leg down right here, another leg right here. "
"272140","273740"," We should get a third leg."
"274360","276740"," Now this could take two to three sessions."
"276740","278180"," Could be today. "
"278440","282660"," It might not be today, but there should be one more leg down."
"282660","284060"," At least there's one right there."
"284140","284660"," There's two. "
"285040","286460"," We still haven't had a third yet."
"287540","290500"," This wasn't convincing enough for me at this point."
"291020","295460"," This morning I figured we might get this in the overnight and then start the next leg today. "
"296100","298120"," And that hasn't produced itself yet."
"299160","302580"," So we'll take a look and see if we're going to get this third leg down."
"303600","305160"," How long does this take?"
"305160","307280"," Sometimes this could take two, three days. "
"307960","310200"," If we're not going to sell it down right now."
"311060","313160"," Well, I'll bring it up over here for you."
"313560","315040"," I think I put this up here. "
"318000","322180"," So if you follow me on that cap and Zalf, I think I showed three legs down."
"323260","329180"," And we'll do is see if I can bring this down slightly here for a minute."
"329560","329960"," Clean this up. "
"330220","333420"," Let me unmute this book map at this point."
"336460","337700"," Just a second here."
"344500","346420"," So we had the initial roll over here. "
"346620","348200"," This is actually when it took place."
"348460","354720"," I believe this was in, I think I posted this at either like eight o'clock at night or something."
"355500","356840"," I think this is eight o'clock at night. "
"359000","362040"," But this trigger here is a three trigger cluster right up in here."
"362800","364460"," And we had our first leg."
"365380","367040"," Not too long afterwards. "
"368040","369880"," We ended up selling this one down here."
"370060","372560"," Right came back up to the hourly."
"373540","375660"," And this cluster right here was outstanding. "
"376020","379480"," This is a three leg three trigger cluster broke through the daily."
"380700","385780"," And this signified here, we should expect at least a few more days down."
"386040","387840"," Not just one day, but a few more days. "
"388460","391440"," Now within this, we get the first one right here."
"391480","392580"," We get the second one right here."
"392580","396440"," And of course, I'm looking for a pullback yesterday at the end of the day. "
"396980","401220"," Sometime around the middle of the day yesterday, I'm looking for a pullback yesterday or even"
"401220","401580"," today."
"402420","404100"," Some kind of a pullback here."
"406140","409280"," And really what I'm looking for is this trade hire. "
"412120","415100"," Either last night or end of day yesterday, even today."
"417160","421180"," To get that rejection to try to trade down to this 396."
"422420","430220"," This 395, this 395, 386, you're not really going to get, you're not just going to roll down in here"
"430220","433160"," and down and through this support. "
"433640","439540"," This is a weekly momentum coming up from the bottom down here."
"439660","444540"," This is a monthly momentum down below."
"445060","446880"," You're not just going to sell this down. "
"447280","452180"," I know that there are some of you out there that are, you guys drink the fucking Kool-Aid of."
"452900","455720"," You guys drink the Kool-Aid of just we're going to roll over."
"455860","456940"," There's always crash risk. "
"457960","459500"," The people that I watch on YouTube."
"459640","464240"," This is part of the broken clock stuff where you kind of think that the market's just going to"
"464240","465700"," plunge straight down from here."
"466100","468140"," It doesn't normally happen like that. "
"468700","472240"," I've checked this back going all the way to the beginning of the stock market."
"472780","473920"," I've never seen it."
"474100","475780"," There's never been an instance of it. "
"476200","481940"," Even with, even when we have war, there's just never been an instance of us breaking through this"
"481940","484320"," level right here that easily."
"484680","486380"," And I don't expect it either to happen."
"486820","494540"," As a matter of fact, just at this point, I just want to take a point here to note that"
"494540","496080"," here's 400 right here. "
"500630","502110"," There's 400 right here."
"504530","506890"," This was going on all weekend, right?"
"509640","511320"," This was going on all weekend."
"513020","518580"," These are subsellers out there telling you that if we break 400, we're going to have a market"
"518580","518860"," crash. "
"520780","523400"," This is the 21st back here."
"523540","524940"," This is yesterday at 21st."
"525100","526960"," We should have had a market crash here, right?"
"527940","529540"," Should have had a market crash here. "
"529540","530920"," Should have had a market crash here."
"531060","532340"," Should have had a market crash here."
"532800","534340"," And yet, no market crash. "
"534800","535880"," So that hasn't produced itself."
"536640","543040"," And so that's basically why I've got, at this point, I've got the wall of broken clocks video up"
"543040","543740"," for you this morning."
"544900","547620"," As this has not produced itself yet. "
"547860","553600"," Now, the wall of broken clocks can be right once a day, I guess, or once a year, once every"
"553600","554100"," 10 years."
"554100","559880"," We're having a conversation about Mike Barry and what people don't realize about Mike Barry."
"560040","564220"," I love Mike Barry, but people don't realize is the reason is people were pissed. "
"565680","567820"," It wasn't because he was eventually right."
"568160","570180"," And that was only because he took a next leg down."
"570640","574320"," He made some money, but he was wrong for so long. "
"574320","576220"," He could have made 10 times the money."
"577580","582840"," If he had just went with the market and not fought the market for such a long period of time."
"582840","584180"," We're talking years and years. "
"585000","586420"," And so we still haven't seen it, right?"
"586680","588140"," We still haven't seen that crash."
"588480","589160"," Does that mean we don't crash?"
"589460","589540"," No."
"590460","592440"," But you're kind of expecting here. "
"593060","599180"," You want to get some momentum built up to break through these levels down here."
"599260","601940"," I'm just going to delete this stuff so you can see it here."
"604780","608940"," And so what I'm looking for here is I'm looking for this trade higher just like back here. "
"609400","611120"," And just like back here too."
"611120","612140"," So you get the one."
"612600","614740"," You get the break here of the hourly. "
"615500","615900"," Right?"
"616100","616860"," Rejection above."
"617620","618440"," Come back down."
"618560","619980"," You bounce here off the daily. "
"620300","621000"," Rejection above."
"621580","622040"," Right?"
"622140","623420"," This is that downward momentum."
"624000","630340"," So I am personally still looking for at least some kind of a rejection above. "
"631020","636380"," Some kind of a trade higher still at this point, even this morning."
"636540","638260"," This is yesterday and this is even this morning."
"638260","642220"," I'm still looking for at least the trade to check higher here. "
"645780","646540"," Excuse me."
"646640","647060"," I apologize."
"648280","651700"," Now some kind of a squeeze up here to 40250. "
"653040","655520"," 40450 something like this at minimum."
"656480","658860"," And even up here to this 40450."
"659760","661700"," There's even a trade higher here. "
"662420","663740"," It's a failure to close."
"663740","666920"," So the next three days."
"667420","668820"," Well, let's say today, Thursday. "
"669440","670520"," Excuse me."
"670520","671660"," Wednesday, excuse me."
"671820","673260"," Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. "
"674780","682360"," There could be a three bar setup where we fail to close on a higher high."
"682560","685420"," Let me see if I can put this on a daily chart for you and show it."
"685880","687560"," So you can better understand it. "
"688820","689880"," Give me a second here."
"702950","704770"," So just inside of here."
"705170","706710"," This is today right now, right?"
"707470","709130"," You get two to three days here. "
"709970","713090"," This candle should close like green today, believe it or not."
"713790","715290"," I don't look like any decision candle here."
"716110","719530"," What you would do is you would get a two to three days, usually. "
"721890","723490"," And you would end up seeing."
"724530","726910"," This is the yellow box, by the way, this yellow little thing here."
"728230","730570"," But you would see a failure to close above this. "
"730770","733390"," This 404 at least, maybe 403."
"734130","737430"," And then even on a larger time frame, you could see a failure to close."
"738370","740890"," 407 or even 408 above here. "
"741550","742790"," Somewhere up and right up in here."
"743370","746090"," You could see a failure to close the next couple days."
"746990","749690"," And then you would make your next leg lower here. "
"751410","753470"," And so it might start today."
"753570","754250"," It might start tomorrow."
"754430","755030"," I don't really know. "
"755030","758810"," We can figure it out, though, if it starts today, if it starts in three days."
"760450","762510"," It's an hourly chart for you to look at here."
"763130","764170"," And you can still see. "
"767660","769120"," Still kind of see, right?"
"769720","770900"," Trying to still down here."
"771520","773040"," But you still want their rejection."
"773260","774460"," You want to gain this momentum. "
"774960","778800"," If you're embarrassed, you want to gain this momentum to try to break through."
"781020","785180"," Squeeze up here and then try to get some downward momentum coming down."
"785180","787600"," Try to get these triggers to all align. "
"787940","788280"," One, two."
"788760","792240"," You get one, two, three, four, and you'll break through these two below."
"793360","794600"," So that's what I think. "
"795520","797840"," Now, you could get some news today in the minutes."
"797980","803020"," Maybe there's some information in the minutes that we don't know that could send us through."
"803480","810760"," But I mean, I'm telling you, it's like if we get the break below on the minutes of today. "
"811740","813940"," Three spots, seven, five percent."
"817220","824480"," If we get the break below this morning on the minutes, I'm going to expect this afternoon."
"824580","828840"," Excuse me, I said this morning, but if we get the break below here on the minutes, I'm going to"
"828840","833580"," expect this squeeze higher than the real run to start after. "
"833980","839220"," So just be aware of this as the vault comes off the event this afternoon that even if we get"
"839220","845500"," this break below today, maybe before 2pm, then I would expect a squeeze higher than the real next"
"845500","847420"," leg to stop start afterwards."
"848460","851840"," So I'm in no position, I close my calls on the opening bell as usual."
"853120","858560"," I'm going to be looking for the real break here for that next leg down. "
"858720","859640"," So just be aware of that."
"860140","864220"," Right now it's at about 402-404 somewhere in here."
"865460","869520"," I'm going to be watching this all day long to see whenever that squeeze is. "
"869520","878020"," So for me, if there's a trade today, the minutes days like this, I'm going to expect, I mean,"
"878140","879420"," here's my expectation for today."
"879700","884180"," My expectation is between 11am and 2pm, we're going to squeeze up here."
"885040","885620"," That's my expectation. "
"886680","888240"," You're going to get everybody on board for puts."
"888520","893440"," We're going to squeeze higher, and then we'll get this next leg lower."
"893640","894920"," That's my expectation for the day. "
"896600","897840"," Well, let me see here."
"899700","900760"," Slide that over."
"902120","903200"," So you can see it. "
"903260","906900"," I'm going to plot it over here on this chart here for you so that you can see it."
"907580","916660"," What I want to see happen today, 402"
"916660","931660"," right here, 404 "
"931660","934460","-33, believe it or not, right up here."
"939490","944590"," So right up here is where I think we squeeze. "
"945010","949230"," I think people are going to load up on puts in here, and I think we're squeezing higher here by"
"949230","949610"," 11."
"950390","954570"," I'll begin by 11am and then 2.30 or so we'll get up into here."
"955070","956350"," I think that's where the real short is. "
"956470","958610"," I could be wrong in this, but this is where I think it is."
"963840","967220"," Hold on a second here."
"967220","968700"," 397-13. "
"971640","974260"," Right down in here."
"978990","980810"," Mark that one right there."
"989900","990660"," 395. "
"995260","997260"," Right there."
"1000620","1003700"," So these are your weekly and monthly momentum right here."
"1004020","1005480"," This is where the squeeze higher is. "
"1006660","1016950"," And then, yeah, I'm not really seeing a, I guess you"
"1016950","1020670"," can make this two boxes, 402-402 right here."
"1022070","1026270"," And the next one is, give me a second arrow, get this data for you."
"1030500","1031460"," 403-89. "
"1039250","1040050"," Right there."
"1054480","1055460"," Just a second here."
"1057560","1061330"," You can see this. "
"1061830","1062370"," Hold on a second here."
"1081600","1082920"," Got so right down in here."
"1084900","1090220"," So I don't think you can actually see the, I don't think you can actually see. "
"1091400","1093000"," Where real support is here."
"1094240","1095280"," On book map."
"1095960","1097920"," I think there's hidden sellers right here. "
"1098380","1099580"," Our hidden buyers right here."
"1100320","1102440"," I don't think, I don't think book maps showing it to you."
"1109650","1111930"," I'm about to load up on some calls right now too. "
"1138480","1142180"," So I'm looking at 399s and 398s right now."
"1142240","1147560"," If I can get 398s down to 398s would be great at $1."
"1148960","1152580"," And 399s are at 98 cents right now. "
"1154960","1158760"," There's 110,000 calls on 400c."
"1180300","1184360"," I'm in 399c for 97 cents."
"1185060","1188740"," That's 397c for 97 cents. "
"1188940","1191760"," Now unlike yesterday, I was a little pissed off yesterday."
"1191920","1193340"," I went back and looked at my trades yesterday."
"1193340","1194240"," I was a little upset. "
"1196120","1198460"," Because I was up on both trades."
"1199600","1200740"," And then they burned."
"1202360","1204620"," So I'm a little pissed off on myself from yesterday. "
"1205060","1210360"," One of my trades, I was up 120, 130% and I wound up selling."
"1211120","1212340"," So I'm going to pay a little bit more."
"1212760","1216720"," I didn't sell and then sold one of my sold for five cents. "
"1216920","1217580"," One went to zero."
"1218500","1223280"," So I'm going to show you this morning that I'm not going to be fucking around with a bunch of"
"1223280","1224040"," other craziness."
"1224500","1225740"," So I'm in right now. "
"1226640","1229100"," And I'm paying attention to my trades this morning."
"1231960","1233640"," So here, I'm long right now."
"1233880","1234460"," Hold on a second here. "
"1247100","1247580"," 299c."
"1248260","1250520"," I'm in for 0.97 cents."
"1250680","1251840"," So I'm going to try to show you guys. "
"1252420","1255240"," You guys are asking yesterday to see where I am."
"1256640","1257720"," I'm right here long."
"1258980","1259840"," Put this aside. "
"1261840","1265640"," I'm going to have a, well, I didn't have as these stops yesterday either, which kind of pissed me"
"1265640","1266800"," off, breaking my own rules."
"1269740","1271180"," I'm going to have stops down here."
"1272820","1274960"," I'm going to be paying attention to my fucking trades. "
"1275160","1276160"," I'm a little pissed off, man."
"1276280","1280660"," I thought I lost under 2,000, like 1,800 bucks and I lost more than that."
"1281360","1283920"," I made a little bit of money here today, but I'm still upside down for the week. "
"1284140","1289300"," I'm actually down on the, like starting a short week and I'm down already."
"1289300","1290940"," A significant amount of money."
"1292420","1302060"," Some long right here and I'm looking for this trade higher into somewhere up here. "
"1302240","1305180"," At least this first one price target is above here."
"1305480","1307660"," I'll put some edge lines in for you too."
"1319580","1321180"," I'm going to put my stops actually down here. "
"1321460","1323440"," I'm going to do some adding down here if I need to."
"1330280","1331880"," I'm adding right here."
"1341460","1342620"," Leave those here for you. "
"1343980","1345420"," Let me see here."
"1346540","1348020"," I'll do some edge lines for you."
"1358540","1360540"," There's a pre-market low right here. "
"1361960","1364020"," There's a pre-market high above."
"1366180","1367120"," Right there."
"1368760","1370200"," So one right here, one right here. "
"1370920","1371700"," Looks like we touched."
"1372260","1373820"," We failed to touch."
"1374780","1378920"," So we got 408.66. We failed to touch that on the high before. "
"1378920","1384000"," And there's some stuff in ES that I didn't see here at some point."
"1384140","1385060"," We may have tagged that already."
"1385380","1387340"," This might have been the ES tag right here. "
"1391980","1393780"," I'm going to pay attention to my trades this morning."
"1393800","1394580"," I'm a little pissed off."
"1394760","1395600"," Yesterday I was all giddy. "
"1395740","1397640"," I'm like, we got the new bots going."
"1398580","1402640"," And I'm like not paying attention to any of my fucking trades yesterday."
"1402820","1405020"," So today we're going to pay attention to my trades. "
"1405640","1407040"," Make sure I'm not fucking this up."
"1407940","1412240"," I want you to see here the trade that I'm looking for."
"1412860","1414480"," So right in here, this is a spy. "
"1415220","1417840"," And I don't believe for a minute that you're breaking through this."
"1418400","1420080"," I think the trade is higher here."
"1421080","1425900"," And I'm looking for this 40250ish somewhere in here at minimum. "
"1426760","1429720"," And I'm also looking for a second tag even higher."
"1430980","1433060"," So I'm expecting the event ball to come off."
"1433640","1435440"," And a forest to have this trade out. "
"1435580","1439640"," Now once we get up here, I am looking to take another short."
"1440300","1442960"," I've been shorting this down the whole way but not yesterday."
"1443400","1447200"," Yesterday wasn't any of this last capitulation move down. "
"1447480","1448340"," I was just trying to buy dips."
"1449160","1449980"," And the same thing."
"1450220","1451460"," Today I'm trying to buy dips up. "
"1452160","1456340"," And I'll take one more short above here to get below that 396 or 395."
"1457280","1458700"," I'm looking to short it from up here."
"1459840","1462020"," No interest in down here shorting. "
"1464540","1468700"," So if you're feeling bearish, I'm not feeling bearish until we're up here."
"1469540","1471300"," That's where I want to take it above here."
"1479440","1481240"," We're now trading 99 cents. "
"1481620","1483880"," Dollar one of those 399 C's."
"1484520","1486240"," Pay attention to my cursor down here."
"1486240","1487720"," I'm going to keep my eyes above here. "
"1488980","1491980"," So I do want to show you a couple of things here."
"1492660","1494160"," So this is the one here."
"1495020","1496740"," I'm in the first place right here. "
"1496800","1497780"," You're going to see some resistance."
"1498540","1500680"," You'll see some more resistance right here."
"1501040","1502740"," I'll draw some boxes in for you. "
"1504220","1506220"," So you can see the path that I'm looking for."
"1509500","1510720"," There'll be one right there."
"1516080","1517180"," There'll be another one right here. "
"1524880","1525460"," Excuse me."
"1528420","1530160"," Here's my actual PT right here."
"1530580","1532360"," And this is the path that I'm looking for. "
"1533160","1534780"," You guys know I set these up, right?"
"1534920","1536580"," And you guys come back and ask me later on."
"1536780","1537640"," Should I take the short now?"
"1537840","1538600"," Should I take the long now?"
"1541560","1542600"," Somewhere down in here."
"1551630","1553650"," Now do I think we get to PT what I'm not sure?"
"1555610","1558130"," That's going to be my line right there that I'm looking for. "
"1558270","1558870"," What time is this?"
"1559990","1560770"," Let me see here."
"1563060","1565720"," Probably needs to leave that higher so that we can see the times."
"1567360","1568780"," Yeah, right around 1130. "
"1569020","1569800"," Right around 11 o'clock."
"1569960","1570760"," This morning 1130."
"1571500","1572440"," I'm hoping that we're up here. "
"1573380","1574900"," I don't know if this holds up or not."
"1575140","1578340"," The other thing too about this is I'm going to be looking for."
"1582190","1584810"," You can see we already rejected once here on the one minute. "
"1584990","1587090"," You can see that's the tag right there in the one minute."
"1587690","1588770"," So I'll delete that one."
"1588790","1590490"," You can already see that we got up there and tagged it. "
"1590850","1594010"," And I want to see us come up higher."
"1594150","1597470"," I'm going to delete this at this point, but I just want you to see the path that I'm looking"
"1597470","1600210"," for into the rest of the day here."
"1602350","1604370"," Right up in there is what I'm looking for. "
"1604850","1607070"," Nice squeeze higher until 11 o'clock."
"1607730","1610310"," You got everybody loaded up, tits short, loaded up, puts."
"1611530","1615370"," Now if this fails at any point, you'll know where it fails. "
"1615650","1616470"," I'm going to delete this now."
"1616590","1617310"," You can click it."
"1617310","1619810"," You can cut it and paste it, whatever you want to do. "
"1622060","1625240"," And what I'm going to be looking for here is for rejections, right?"
"1625760","1628480"," Rejections off the one minute, rejections off the five minute."
"1629040","1631500"," And I really want to see some kind of a development."
"1631720","1633420"," I want you guys to pay attention to this here, okay?"
"1635760","1645360"," So on this crossover here, I'm going to be looking, this is what I'm looking"
"1645360","1655010"," for for continuation is this kind of a move here and then the price to trade"
"1655010","1658110"," higher, rejection, and to continue higher. "
"1658350","1663670"," Now with all of this said right here, what I'm looking for here, there can be moments where we'll"
"1663670","1664290"," roll over."
"1664790","1666310"," You have to tell you guys every day, right?"
"1666450","1671790"," You're going to roll over here and then it squeezes higher, quote unquote, liquidation breaks"
"1671790","1672630"," sometimes here."
"1672630","1674310"," And then we continue higher. "
"1674550","1678490"," So there are places to take profit and re-enter your trade."
"1678610","1680010"," Make sure you're on the right side of the trade."
"1680650","1686450"," We're already squeezing higher right now, now trading $1.13. And we might get this pullback real"
"1686450","1686970"," quick above. "
"1688090","1691210"," And we're going to delete all that so you guys can see what that is."
"1692990","1693870"," Let me see here."
"1696370","1697290"," You can see it above. "
"1698050","1700670"," And every little pullback that we get, you can come back."
"1700750","1701710"," You'll see some resistance."
"1701710","1708190"," Enter above here at $3.99.07. I'll probably take profit there and then re-enter once we are above. "
"1708770","1714550"," Now, trade $1.19 $18 $19 right now $1.20 baby."
"1715430","1716550"," Squeeze on up."
"1717730","1720010"," Raise your stops up as we go. "
"1720870","1722910"," I never got to add into my position."
"1723470","1729250"," There was no chance to do that."
"1729250","1734490"," Not to trade $1.19. Trust me, I'll end this fucking week green, I promise you. "
"1734830","1738170"," I was like, I'm a very competitive person."
"1738350","1738890"," I don't want to lose."
"1739330","1740390"," I don't like losing. "
"1746580","1748080"," Yeah, watch this in the background."
"1749400","1750720"," Not a fan of losing."
"1750920","1751420"," Never have been. "
"1752040","1760260"," Big athlete in my life and never been a fan of losing $3.99.09. Yeah, somewhere in here."
"1766540","1769300"," Now, on this one minute here, I don't want to see this one minute break."
"1769300","1776320"," I want to see it hold for this leg up to $3.99.07. And I will see if this"
"1776320","1779100"," produces the results that I'm looking for. "
"1783800","1784640"," Let me see here."
"1787780","1791100"," Let me turn this guy down in the background, the new squawk."
"1799200","1803120"," And you may or may not know this, but we do have vol later in the week as well. "
"1803440","1805940"," So today at 2 p.m. we've got the FOMC minute release."
"1807120","1813460"," We've got the Feds John Williams speaking at 5.30 p.m. And then we on Thursday, we have at"
"1813460","1814440"," 8.30 in the morning."
"1814620","1817920"," We've got initial claims, our job claims, GDP. "
"1818980","1821280"," We've got Bostik at 10.50 in the morning."
"1821580","1825580"," So both of those are at 8.30 a.m. And then we've got Bostik speaking at 10.50 a "
"1825580","1833340",".m. And Mary Daly speaking at 2 p.m. And then on Friday, we've got consumer spending, personal"
"1833340","1836440"," income, PCE, and the core PCE."
"1836780","1838340"," We all know that the PCE. "
"1838340","1844660"," Actually, this PCE might actually be a moment for the market to trade higher as it's not."
"1845380","1853800"," The price of goods isn't really an indication of the cost being passed along to the consumer."
"1854160","1861260"," So that might be a point of contention this time that the production costs are being, or be spun to"
"1861260","1864680"," say that the production costs are being passed along to the consumer. "
"1866460","1870600"," And then we've got, those are all at 8.30 in the morning."
"1870800","1878260"," Then on Friday at 10 a.m. we've got consumer sentiment, new home sales, 10.15. We've got Philip"
"1878260","1879080"," Jefferson speaking."
"1879920","1883680"," And then we've got Loretta Messer at 10.15 as well. "
"1884040","1885620"," And then at 11.30, we've got Bullard speaking."
"1886680","1889760"," We've got Collins speaking at 1.30. And then we've got Waller speaking."
"1890180","1893540"," So just a bunch of ship smearing on the wall. "
"1895530","1901350"," Trading $1.22 in those calls, $3.99. We'll see now."
"1901750","1906650"," So what I'm watching for here is, I'll show you guys what I'm watching for here."
"1907350","1909290"," We tested this one minute right now. "
"1909370","1911190"," You see how we have the nice beautiful test down below."
"1911370","1911850"," We're holding it."
"1912170","1914990"," I'm trying to trade $3.99.04 currently. "
"1917260","1919860"," I'll try to take these calls off up here."
"1921580","1923720"," And then I'll look to re-enter the trade."
"1923720","1927360"," Matter of fact, I'll just snap the line right now for you so you can see it. "
"1928240","1931820"," It's going to be somewhere right in here."
"1938310","1943110"," I'll just put it there because we should tag above and then come back down and consolidate."
"1944510","1946550"," You might actually consolidate down here. "
"1947330","1949070"," We'll get the trade higher rejection."
"1949650","1952030"," We'll trade back to the one minute and then make our way higher."
"1962960","1964540"," So get your finger on the sell button. "
"1964740","1971620"," We're now at $1.26. I'm going to be looking for this squeeze into this $3.99.03. Get ready"
"1971620","1972640"," to sell at some point."
"1989020","1992140"," And we're going to look at a market breath this morning as well."
"1992380","1995860"," We got some decent acceleration and price down yesterday. "
"1996520","1998540"," So I had a chance to look at market breath."
"1999060","2002960"," We're going to talk about that this morning, where we are in market breath."
"2004120","2010980"," We should get a, and then this leads back into the last portion. "
"2010980","2018460"," If we trade higher into that $4.02, $4.04, even a failure to close above the $4.08, $4 "
"2018460","2019680",".07 or something like that."
"2020040","2021520"," We got a failure to get a new high."
"2022800","2027940"," Up there, we should get one more, one more finishing trade lower. "
"2028740","2029940"," I don't know if that's next week though."
"2030120","2033380"," If it's in the end of month worth it's this week at this point."
"2035460","2036860"," But we'll look at the market breath. "
"2037180","2038080"," There's a little bit more breath."
"2039600","2045660"," Yesterday, we went down to 21% on market breath, which is a good sign."
"2046240","2050139"," It usually leads to something I'm not going to mention in the broadcast at this moment. "
"2050940","2052980"," But I will mention it to you in just a few minutes."
"2053280","2058320"," Remember yesterday I was talking to you about wanting to see us hit down to 21%."
"2058320","2063719"," And we'll talk about that coming into as soon as I'm done out of this trade right here. "
"2063719","2075040"," As soon as I start to consolidate, I'll now trade $1.27, $1.28. And"
"2075040","2081260"," I'm going to take my money here and have a sell order in now as we trade higher here."
"2081679","2085540"," I'm going to try to grab $1.29 and we just tagged it for a minute."
"2085679","2087080"," But I haven't got enough fill yet. "
"2087420","2089219"," So there we go."
"2089440","2094780"," So I just sold at $1.29 and we went up to $1.32. This should give you plenty of"
"2094780","2096800"," time to take your money off this trade."
"2097540","2100220"," And now what I'm looking for here is two things to happen. "
"2102660","2105080"," So I'm looking for this break above here."
"2106380","2112790"," And I'm looking for this for this white line here to come up here."
"2113430","2119930"," And I want to see price come back down and test this one minute at some point. "
"2120890","2123610"," Maybe this red line to come back some consolidation."
"2124270","2126470"," And this is my consolidation line right here."
"2126550","2129050"," I'm going to move this in place in just a moment here for you. "
"2131600","2132600"," So this one right here."
"2132720","2135880"," I'm going to move this in place so that we get some consolidation at some point."
"2145290","2145890"," So there we go. "
"2145930","2147470"," I'm slowly making my money back."
"2147750","2148890"," I guarantee my Friday."
"2148950","2149810"," I'm fucking green. "
"2151810","2152370"," Guarantee it."
"2153630","2154890"," Happy this morning already."
"2156170","2157990"," I'm like, I hate fucking losing, man. "
"2158210","2159730"," I hate starting a week losing too."
"2159730","2161610"," I think I've done that twice now."
"2161630","2165530"," I think two weeks ago I started the week down like three fucking thousand dollars or something. "
"2165530","2168990"," And I was like, I was angry for like two days or something."
"2169690","2172890"," And then I wound up up in the week like I think it was six grand or something."
"2173670","2174150"," So I'm happy. "
"2175590","2177110"," At this point, I'm fucking happy."
"2179930","2185790"," Now, remember you're talking about people saying that the number for crashes that."
"2186730","2187910"," Well, 400, right?"
"2188410","2190490"," And I gave you the number saying it's actually low. "
"2190590","2191550"," It's 396, 395."
"2192170","2192830"," It's not 400."
"2194550","2196470"," And we're going to talk about that this morning too. "
"2196570","2198270"," I want to talk to you guys about two things."
"2199110","2200730"," I want to talk to you about market breath."
"2201070","2201590"," We have a second. "
"2201650","2202490"," I'm going to write this stuff down."
"2206700","2209120"," I want to talk to you guys about market breath this morning."
"2210180","2210520"," All right. "
"2210680","2213000"," Some flat so I can talk about this while you guys are trading."
"2213480","2214200"," So market breath."
"2214200","2221760"," And I want to talk to you about below 396 and what it means here. "
"2224100","2225460"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"2226360","2233100"," If you're still in 399s, they're now trading a dollar 40 dollar 40."
"2233280","2234240"," We're not even waiting, right?"
"2234380","2235500"," We're just blasting through. "
"2236920","2238840"," So snap this one right here."
"2239220","2240800"," And I'll put another one down here."
"2240800","2248910"," Once this put another one down in here, it'll be here or here where we pull back. "
"2248910","2249870"," We should."
"2249990","2255110"," We should pull back some point right on this red line and possibly even have that quote unquote"
"2255110","2255990"," liquidation break."
"2256750","2259130"," And you'll get another leg higher right here at some point. "
"2264100","2264660"," Watch it."
"2264760","2266580"," Just leave me behind here and be pissed off."
"2269620","2270060"," Okay. "
"2271180","2273760"," So we're going to talk about two important things this morning."
"2273940","2274100"," Okay."
"2279120","2281300"," I mean, just a second here and we mute this book map here. "
"2284660","2286500"," Wiki, do me a solid, will you?"
"2286880","2296640"," Will you put a blocked word for us or put a don't block"
"2296640","2296900"," it."
"2298220","2302300"," Put in a anyone in chat says market crash."
"2303540","2311520"," I want you to make up something to say make a response like Mike Barry's been short since 1996 or"
"2311520","2311840"," something. "
"2314360","2315880"," Something kind of funny."
"2316860","2319580"," Or you don't know how short Mike Barry is."
"2319840","2320880"," Something funny. "
"2322000","2325460"," So that I can at least track anybody that's out there fucking around with."
"2327260","2330960"," With with saying market crash nonsense."
"2332080","2333600"," I've been saying it since May or June. "
"2333900","2336560"," So last year, so I can't listen to it anymore."
"2338520","2340880"," At this point, I've just had it with market crash."
"2344130","2349270"," 399 C is now trading $1.49. They were like 97 cents or something. "
"2349530","2350810"," So they're 50% at this point."
"2351630","2354490"," If you're still long here, power to you."
"2355210","2358690"," Maybe you're just going to diamond hand all the way up to this PT above it. "
"2358810","2361370"," I can't blame you for doing that."
"2361910","2364470"," I'm going to jump back on the train right back here."
"2369220","2373200"," Now we're going to take a quick look. "
"2374220","2374920"," Quick look."
"2375360","2379040"," I'm going to take a quick look on something I want you guys to see."
"2379140","2379280"," Okay. "
"2379320","2380620"," I'm going to look at market breath with you."
"2380920","2385060"," I'm going to look at what happens below 396."
"2385620","2388680"," And how do you know if we're going to get a market crash, right?"
"2389400","2391220"," Mike Barry's been short since 1996. "
"2394580","2396800"," So you guys want to know how you'll see it."
"2396840","2397480"," I'll show it to you."
"2398840","2400640"," So if you're like, if you're out there and you're like. "
"2402400","2407600"," So and so on YouTube saying we're getting a market crash or so and so on, fin twit."
"2409360","2411920"," Or so and so is the smartest guy in the world."
"2412600","2415520"," I don't fucking know the shit that I was reading in the chat yesterday. "
"2416100","2417340"," I was like, this is insane."
"2417560","2418660"," I can't believe this is happening."
"2418660","2422760"," Like, I'm going to start handing out fucking blocks. "
"2423080","2425360"," I'm like still a little angry about this."
"2428680","2430960"," I get angry and bulls on this too."
"2431280","2433380"," And I'll explain that another time why I've explained it in the past. "
"2433620","2438700"," Sometimes bulls will send me DMS where they're like, I'm long a million dollars on Tesla, 1200"
"2438700","2439060"," bucks."
"2439900","2443040"," And then we trade down to fucking 100 and they're just gone, right?"
"2445480","2447780"," So I'm going to try to grab this right in here at some point."
"2450860","2453120"," And I don't like getting those DMS from people. "
"2453340","2455080"," I get those DMS people who's a million dollars."
"2455220","2456420"," Same with shorts too."
"2457620","2460980"," I don't want to see a bear lose a million dollars on a market crash bullshit. "
"2461240","2461960"," I've done that actually."
"2462160","2463080"," You might not know that."
"2464840","2467200"," At a bottom, I went in for like 100 grand. "
"2467380","2469740"," I was 100 grand or 130 or something."
"2473390","2474730"," Maybe 90, I don't know."
"2475350","2476450"," And it went to fucking zero. "
"2477410","2478830"," Straight up, I held it to zero."
"2484310","2485690"," I'm going to try to grab this here."
"2490260","2492260"," I'm going to let this simmer for just a minute. "
"2492340","2493160"," I'm going to get trapped in here."
"2495420","2498500"," Okay, so I'm going to let this work itself out for a second here."
"2498540","2500040"," Maybe you're jumping in and putting on risk. "
"2500960","2501620"," I'm going to want to."
"2502920","2504140"," So I already sold those."
"2505380","2506840"," So here I'm now a buyer. "
"2516350","2519050"," I'd like to be a buyer down here to be honest with you."
"2519690","2521590"," I would really like to buy."
"2523070","2524890"," I'm going to hang out here for a minute. "
"2524970","2525850"," I know you do."
"2525990","2526670"," This might just go."
"2527110","2528690"," It might just leave me behind here. "
"2532260","2533880"," I'm trying to be a buyer down here."
"2534100","2534800"," Everyone's like fuck you."
"2534920","2535340"," We're out of here. "
"2536740","2538460"," We're going to leave your ass behind."
"2540320","2543100"," There's that PT above right there by 1130."
"2543520","2544560"," You know how high that is. "
"2544660","2546480"," We had a lot of people a lot of running."
"2546480","2547300"," We have to do here."
"2547780","2551340"," If this white line catches up right here, I might. "
"2551660","2553120"," I might join you before."
"2553900","2554720"," I want to see."
"2554900","2558340"," I want to see price come down here and just check this. "
"2558680","2560620"," I think the I think the trade's like right here."
"2561040","2563020"," I think that's where the trade is."
"2563100","2563740"," It's like right here. "
"2564520","2565340"," Right there."
"2566640","2568440"," You can see that where that trade is."
"2568440","2569140"," It actually is. "
"2572300","2579120"," According to roast that Russian oil and gas condensate output, down 0.4%. Let me know in the chat"
"2579120","2582560"," if I can't hear the guy talking in the background today."
"2583300","2585520"," Let me know if he's too low if you can hear him or not."
"2585800","2586520"," The new squawk. "
"2588320","2589700"," I'm just going to get rid of this one."
"2591680","2592540"," I'm looking man."
"2592720","2594680"," I'm looking for this to come back and check dude. "
"2596140","2597880"," I want to see that check down below."
"2597880","2599040"," We might not even get it."
"2599180","2600200"," Wait to start blasting off. "
"2606790","2608030"," Yeah, my fingers on a buy."
"2608190","2608770"," I haven't bought yet."
"2613920","2615120"," Well, then I got to clear it. "
"2616480","2619320"," I have like a two step buy process and I'm not a."
"2622670","2624330"," Like fat finger in a buy here."
"2627010","2628590"," Come back just for a minute, bro."
"2640210","2640610"," 40222. "
"2644850","2649490"," This is coming down to just so you know, so this PT is actually coming down as time passes."
"2651310","2653310"," 40222 right up in here."
"2662180","2663100"," Come on down. "
"2677150","2679190"," And actually I was set up on 399."
"2679790","2681390"," I'm now going to set up on 400."
"2683590","2685390"," I'm kind of glad I didn't buy those. "
"2695410","2700110"," I'm in for a dollar three on 400 C."
"2703310","2708390"," So I bought actually up here and I'm going to have to add down below if we reverse here at"
"2708390","2708770"," any point."
"2710170","2712270"," So I'll put an add down below here."
"2717450","2719330"," If we reject here at any point. "
"2723000","2724840"," Then I'll put stops down below."
"2727580","2730380"," And I'll probably put stops in case we erase that whole move."
"2731680","2732520"," Down here. "
"2734280","2737400"," This is on the start and says that the Washington Post got."
"2737560","2740460"," Now trading a dollar 10 on 400 C."
"2743620","2751940"," So you can see I'm in for a dollar is 0.03. Bam."
"2752200","2762040"," Got some ringing in my ears this morning"
"2762040","2762340"," too. "
"2762460","2763600"," I think I'm dehydrated."
"2769420","2770600"," Maybe that helps you."
"2773380","2775860"," Just waiting for this one minute to catch back up here. "
"2775860","2777820"," It's waiting for this one minute here."
"2778700","2781280"," I want to see this one minute run back up here."
"2781620","2783380"," If we do get a break below. "
"2784620","2787680"," I will cut short or I'll cut longs."
"2788060","2788800"," I don't want to see."
"2789280","2791360"," I want to see price get underneath here. "
"2792220","2794520"," Forget any of this kind of like nonsense in here."
"2794560","2798000"," I'll cut loose and try to reposition a little early to this trade."
"2798200","2798880"," But I don't want to miss it. "
"2799220","2800580"," I want to miss the squeeze higher."
"2807360","2808940"," Put not a little bit more risk today."
"2811580","2814640"," We're going to look at two things this morning. "
"2814760","2816080"," We're going to look at the market breadth."
"2816460","2819000"," And we're going to look at if we do get a crash."
"2820240","2821500"," How will it show itself?"
"2822500","2823200"," How do you know?"
"2825440","2828200"," We're going to explain that to you this morning. "
"2829000","2830240"," How do you know before it happens?"
"2830520","2831700"," How do you know how long it happens?"
"2834060","2835820"," What signals you're looking for?"
"2849990","2851690"," Remember this white line right here?"
"2851810","2855130"," You're waiting for this white line to come up and break above."
"2858900","2861100"," Waiting for this velocity to catch up here."
"2861820","2867920"," And you're looking for this to cross under. "
"2867920","2875300"," And then I'm looking for price to stay above here."
"2877140","2882260"," I'm going to start to make that attack for 469, 479 right up in here."
"2892950","2895610"," Now trading at $8, $7,400. "
"2895970","2896470"," See, hold on here."
"2901470","2904330"," I want to get fucked up in my fucking calls here."
"2908620","2913640"," There is 143,000 contracts on 400C. "
"2923180","2925240"," My stops are likely higher, too."
"2926860","2929500"," I don't want to see any kind of breaking down below here."
"2932840","2935180"," This dream is sponsored by To The Tick. "
"2935860","2939040"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels."
"2939220","2940860"," Be careful here, have a liquidation break."
"2941140","2941780"," You might see one. "
"2942620","2947240"," You will possibly see quick, quick moves down, trying to sell this."
"2948680","2950060"," It's entirely possible."
"2950580","2951500"," Speak really careful in here. "
"2954200","2956180"," Bulls need to hold above."
"2960010","2963750"," We can break below briefly, but bulls need to hold this right here."
"2964090","2964450"," You have a choice. "
"2988660","2999050"," I guess"
"2999050","3000490"," you could write PT1 right here."
"3001730","3002330"," PT1."
"3007380","3017320"," Then you could do PT2, above right"
"3017320","3017680"," up here. "
"3018540","3020880"," There we go."
"3024400","3024960"," Something like that."
"3038810","3040130"," This will be a reversal. "
"3040530","3041910"," This is a reversal trade here."
"3043090","3047850"," It should trade to close to 402.29. Some are up in here."
"3049010","3050370"," Bulls can't hold on to this. "
"3050530","3050990"," We'll head lower."
"3055480","3060400"," Bulls, if we can do this kind of nonsense, but if we roll over, we'll end up seeing a new"
"3060400","3061040"," low down here."
"3073120","3076400"," Just waiting for this one minute to catch up here for momentum to catch above. "
"3077160","3080760"," I'll delete that so you can see the one minute catching up now to push it higher."
"3085340","3095260"," If you're a bear, you"
"3095260","3099720"," want to pay attention to the next segment of the program we talk about."
"3101020","3104200"," How are you able to identify an actual market crash?"
"3105620","3110160"," If that were to take place, we even further down from this 396-297 area. "
"3113420","3115080"," And some timing as well."
"3115420","3117020"," We'll talk about the time it takes."
"3118080","3119780"," Do we have a few days down?"
"3120460","3124140"," At Kevin's offer, it said three to five sessions, maybe six sessions of down. "
"3125200","3130880"," If we break some key levels with some velocity, we'll actually get two to three weeks down."
"3131540","3139560"," And then if we break another level, we could see actually not two to three weeks, but months of"
"3139560","3139880"," down."
"3140660","3142260"," And that's where you get your market crash. "
"3142500","3144340"," I'll show you how that sets itself up."
"3145780","3149540"," So if you are a bear and you like, hey, I'm on the market crash camp, we're going to do"
"3149540","3150100"," it this spring."
"3151220","3152800"," I'll show you what to be looking for. "
"3152860","3156320"," You can check in every day to watch to see if that's setting itself up."
"3157020","3158180"," And we'll check it every day."
"3158440","3163640"," If it's still valid, then that could happen at some point. "
"3164540","3165900"," We'll keep an eye on it."
"3166180","3171760"," Unless we trade above, I'll give you the numbers that we'll trade above if it cancels itself out or"
"3171760","3171940"," not."
"3175500","3179140"," So it'll be an important part of the broadcast today for you to pay attention to. "
"3183210","3185330"," It's waiting to see how this develops here."
"3186210","3190270"," And then if we start trading up here at some point, if this white line breaks above."
"3192350","3195170"," We'll switch over and do that second of the program for you. "
"3205200","3207860"," I want to make sure I'm not getting burned in my trades today."
"3208780","3211760"," I don't normally get burned in my trades in yesterday, man."
"3211760","3215120"," I went back and looked like you have like a log of what you do. "
"3215940","3217120"," And I was so pissed."
"3218340","3220700"," I was up like 130%."
"3220700","3223280"," And then I was up like 30% on another trade. "
"3225660","3227660"," And I could have just fucking closed."
"3228160","3233840"," Not only could I have closed, we'd come into some resistance on both trades above."
"3234760","3238760"," And rather than take my money and wait for the next leg higher or failure. "
"3238760","3240840"," I just let him fucking run."
"3241160","3243280"," So I'm like, I'm already breaking all my own rules here."
"3243780","3247420"," I'm breaking all my own fucking rules, trading. "
"3248300","3250380"," Like these are rules that I never brought well."
"3250760","3251620"," Sometimes I do."
"3252840","3259760"," If my belief is, or my thesis, I still believe in my thesis. "
"3260380","3263980"," But I should have cut those long long before I did yesterday."
"3270060","3274860"," Now trading $3.99.31. Just waiting for this one minute to catch back up."
"3276080","3277900"," Be aware that you might get a liquidation break. "
"3278160","3279780"," Still think I talked about that already with you."
"3279900","3280700"," Sometimes they'll do this."
"3281100","3282380"," You got a fast liquidation breakdown. "
"3282720","3283520"," It's a good place to add."
"3284540","3286420"," If we hold underneath it, it's a good place to stop."
"3286580","3287560"," It gets stopped out as well. "
"3288400","3292020"," So if we can come down here and grab a little liquidation break, I might grab some more calls."
"3292960","3293520"," That's my position."
"3311220","3312960"," I need to be in the one minute here. "
"3313260","3314560"," I'm on the 15 minute chart here."
"3316360","3336400"," I wonder"
"3336400","3338560"," if I should grab these at 90 or wait a minute here."
"3343730","3346190"," So I just grabbed another 10 pack for 90 cents. "
"3346510","3347110"," Sum up to 20."
"3350370","3352750"," I'm going to think I'm $1.03 or something like that."
"3352970","3353790"," And then it's 90 cents. "
"3353930","3356290"," I'm in trading down at 85 right now."
"3364760","3366500"," I'm going to actually update this so you can see it."
"3399730","3402790"," I'll put you on BookMap so you can see BookMap right here in the background. "
"3424300","3427220"," Now, 11, 14 bulls have 15 minutes to go higher."
"3451230","3452250"," I didn't have a chance yesterday."
"3452250","3453390"," I didn't get to do..."
"3453390","3462450"," Yesterday I wanted to do a review of AI companies and go through those and see if there are any"
"3462450","3464250"," worth buying at lower prices. "
"3464810","3465750"," We've been down..."
"3465750","3471670"," So normally when we're down like this, all I will scan stocks for..."
"3471670","3473990"," that are not going down while the market goes down."
"3474250","3477690"," And then also I'm scanning stocks for lows to buy on."
"3478630","3480650"," So I'm keeping my eyes out on..."
"3480650","3487350"," Right now I'm keeping my eyes out on some of the smaller AI companies for the next couple of years"
"3487350","3487610"," here. "
"3488470","3489910"," Maybe a one to three year hold."
"3490290","3496990"," And if there's anywhere to buy those companies on a down day or a down week, down few weeks, is"
"3496990","3498630"," there a place to buy these AI stocks?"
"3499350","3505390"," I'm not talking about the Nvidia's out there or Facebook's, but some of the lesser known companies"
"3505390","3509470"," that have been booming since the beginning of the year."
"3510010","3512270"," Is there a place to actually jump on that train?"
"3512670","3514250"," And these are like one to three year holds. "
"3514830","3517910"," So if we do get a chance today to look at those, we will."
"3519990","3522010"," Yesterday I wanted to do it, but I didn't."
"3522170","3524590"," So if we get time, I'll add those on there for today. "
"3524630","3530070"," If we have a moment to be able to do a segment on AI stocks for you and see if"
"3530070","3531130"," we can grab some of those."
"3532450","3538970"," At some point I'd like to have a small portfolio of that stuff for the next few years."
"3540710","3544230"," See if we can run up with the meme traders. "
"3544830","3547730"," I'm assuming those are going to become memes at some point or they already have."
"3548650","3549630"," But I think it's still early."
"3550150","3551330"," I think it's still..."
"3551330","3553930"," Let's say that trade started in December or October. "
"3554770","3556910"," I expect that trade to run for one to three years."
"3556910","3565720"," Just based on interest, not even fundamentals, just interest."
"3566560","3568480"," I expect that trade to run for a few years. "
"3570140","3573160"," There'll be the next class of meme stocks in one to three years."
"3581950","3585790"," Just sitting here watching, waiting for 230 here."
"3586330","3587770"," Not 230, excuse me, 1130. "
"3656910","3658050"," Getting greedy here."
"3658210","3659790"," I want to buy another tenant."
"3660150","3661810"," It's at 78 cents right now. "

"3843410","3846330"," I apologize for having my dog with me right now. "
"3857440","3858840"," I've got two dogs."
"3859140","3860440"," One of these dogs, man."
"3860580","3861380"," You can't leave them alone. "
"3861380","3863780"," He needs to be held at all times."
"3864260","3865660"," My other dog is stoic."
"3866440","3867880"," I've got one dog that's not. "
"3868520","3871960"," I've got one dog that's like, I can't ever be alone or not held."
"3882840","3884000"," You should see this."
"3884680","3889860"," So the middle of the night last night, I guess I had a stolen vehicle. "
"3892180","3895200"," Some kind was left in front of my house in the middle of the night."
"3895580","3896960"," It's a true Detroit fashion."
"3896960","3901300"," I have a great story, too, about another stolen vehicle. "
"3901300","3904240"," When I first moved to Detroit, I'll tell you this story in a bit."
"3904640","3907540"," I'll tell you the stolen vehicle stories."
"3913960","3922400"," It's actually, it was very aggravating, but I guess in hindsight, humorous to tell the story now. "
"3926030","3927650"," But I'll tell you that story later."
"3928710","3929890"," Get a great car story for you."
"3930930","3933170"," So this is my first introduction to a stolen car. "
"3933370","3933610"," It's not."
"3934110","3938210"," I have another stolen car story for you."
"3942920","3944540"," More time we spend down here. "
"3944980","3947340"," The more bullish it is, whether you know that or not."
"3948080","3952380"," The more time we spend here, the more likelihood we have of going up from here."
"3956000","3961120"," The 15 minute, the half an hour, the one hour is all pointing towards up right now. "
"3961300","3963280"," The momentum is coming into the bull's favor."
"3963280","3966880"," Well, for a nice fat squeeze higher."
"3967540","3972820"," Now trade 99 cents, 97 cents, 96 cents. "
"3973000","3974280"," You should get an explosive move here."
"3974460","3976580"," Break out your memes, your rocket ship memes."
"3977720","3979700"," We should get a nice fat squeeze here. "
"3991070","3992670"," So anyways, middle of the night, right?"
"3992990","3994130"," I checked the cameras this morning."
"3994830","3997310"," I had to go over my review cameras, call the police this morning."
"3998130","4000010"," And this car, I don't know how it got there. "
"4000010","4002990"," It looks like it's like right out of a movie."
"4003630","4005110"," It's missing like it's doors."
"4005250","4006310"," It's missing everything. "
"4006530","4007930"," It has an engine in it."
"4008870","4009650"," I'll take a picture."
"4009850","4011570"," If I can take a break here at some point. "
"4011670","4013450"," I'll grab my wife and kids."
"4013550","4015330"," We'll take like a quick family photo."
"4016010","4019230"," All photogenic like like what's part of the family or something. "
"4020010","4023870"," I'll do like a comedic photo in front of it."
"4023870","4025090"," Like welcome to the family."
"4025610","4026630"," Brand new car too. "
"4026730","4027770"," It's like stripped down."
"4028370","4029730"," I don't know how it got here."
"4029990","4031990"," I was looking at my cameras to see how it got here. "
"4033210","4036750"," And it looks like it was stripped for parts and then dropped off."
"4037470","4039830"," I don't know if it was towed here by a tow truck."
"4040070","4042530"," Dropped off by a tow truck that's wrapped up in some kind of. "
"4042830","4043870"," Because we're in a city, right?"
"4044050","4046430"," So in a city there, chop shops and stuff like that."
"4047650","4049990"," And of course, I'm calling the police this morning."
"4050190","4053530"," And the police are like, well, what does the car look like?"
"4054450","4055970"," And I'm like, oh, you can't miss it. "
"4055970","4057570"," I'm like, he can't miss this thing."
"4057850","4058990"," It's like a brand new car."
"4059170","4061250"," It looks like it was driven to Joy Road. "
"4061710","4063050"," Like a joy riding or something."
"4063470","4064550"," It's like smashed it up."
"4065050","4067910"," Looks like a Mad Max brand new car, Mad Maxed out. "
"4068530","4071790"," And then damaged from joy riding too, I guess."
"4072090","4073790"," It's all that say the whole mix or match."
"4075250","4078950"," And so I'm talking to police this morning. "
"4079050","4080970"," I'm like, I'm like, you can't miss this fucking thing."
"4081110","4084470"," I'm like, it has no business being here."
"4084470","4086110"," It's like a gentrified neighborhood too. "
"4086550","4090610"," Like, you know, this has no business in this name sitting here on the side of the road here."
"4092170","4095370"," And so I'm talking to the police this morning and they're still not here."
"4095430","4096090"," They haven't come yet. "
"4096830","4098229"," I don't even know if they're coming."
"4098810","4102330"," And I didn't say this this morning on Twitter, but I should have said this."
"4103710","4105529"," Because I have had another experience. "
"4105870","4107910"," I said this is my first experience with a stolen car."
"4108069","4109229"," Indeed, I'm a Detroiter now."
"4109229","4114670"," But the truth is that I have had another experience with a stolen car here. "
"4115010","4116510"," I bought a house here."
"4118189","4121790"," And I didn't get into the garage of the house."
"4123069","4124250"," Oh, here we go. "
"4124550","4128229"," Come on, bulls can't lose this bulls."
"4128810","4129810"," So I guess I have this other."
"4130109","4131630"," So I buy this house, right?"
"4132689","4136229"," And I get a great story about a stolen car. "
"4136229","4137170"," So moved to Detroit, right?"
"4137310","4138029"," I buy a house here."
"4138670","4141109"," And I bought many at this point."
"4141210","4142270"," But this is one house I bought. "
"4143090","4149040"," Or I haven't seen inside the garage."
"4149359","4153560"," It had this old fold down door from the 1940s or something."
"4154359","4156319"," You couldn't even buy a door like this any longer. "
"4156520","4158220"," You're like a finger touch it and they slide up."
"4159620","4161100"," It's a big, huge garage door."
"4161359","4164279"," I may knock the ball here. "
"4164279","4169279"," So in this door, it's been smashed or broken."
"4169520","4171700"," You can't get it open or whatever to get inside the garage."
"4171700","4173479"," But I eventually get the door open. "
"4175000","4175479"," And I find."
"4177540","4178140"," Excuse me."
"4178439","4180359"," I find a Nissan truck in there. "
"4181460","4183700"," This thing's like brand new to this thing's like."
"4184660","4189040"," I don't know, maybe at most five years old, three to five years old."
"4190200","4191600"," So I find a stolen truck. "
"4191600","4193440"," Or look at what looks like a stolen truck."
"4194640","4195760"," Inside of this garage."
"4196800","4198480"," And it's stripped, right?"
"4198720","4199980"," It's missing a bunch of shit. "
"4202600","4205740"," So I get the garage door off."
"4205960","4208360"," Finally, I like remove the entire garage door."
"4208700","4209560"," Push it to the side. "
"4210740","4214340"," And now I can get access to this truck that I find in there."
"4214440","4215780"," I'm like, is there a dead body in there?"
"4216100","4217160"," You never know, right?"
"4217320","4217700"," It's in the city."
"4219000","4221100"," So Detroit at that time was. "
"4223360","4225140"," It wasn't like at the war zone."
"4225320","4227080"," It would say Detroit used to be a war zone."
"4228440","4232960"," And then I'd say like five to 10 years ago, it started to make a real turn. "
"4233920","4236100"," Maybe 10 years ago, started to make a real turn."
"4236560","4239280"," And then about five years ago, it's getting kind of getting nice."
"4240400","4242360"," Now, right now, it's really nice to trade. "
"4242620","4245560"," Even though it's portrayed as not being nice, it is very, a very nice city."
"4245720","4247640"," It reminds me of any city I've been to right now."
"4249380","4252580"," So, so anyways, there's still bad neighborhoods and shit, right?"
"4252720","4253020"," But whatever. "
"4253480","4256120"," So I'm looking at this, I'm looking at this truck."
"4256920","4258340"," And I'm like, well, what the fuck do I do?"
"4258540","4263680"," And of course, I've never lived or I grew up in a city that was gentrified, but I've never lived"
"4263680","4267260"," anywhere where I might find a stolen vehicle ever, right?"
"4267700","4268520"," So I don't know what to do."
"4268560","4269680"," So I call the police, right?"
"4269900","4272480"," Isn't that the thing that you would think that you would do as you call the police?"
"4274440","4277660"," And they'll come out and take a report or something or have it towed. "
"4278680","4279500"," Find the owner."
"4280520","4286340"," I don't know, tow it to a police yard and at least somebody could come and be like, that's my"
"4286340","4289520"," stolen vehicle over there for insurance purposes or whatever."
"4290460","4292120"," And they're like, we ain't coming out there. "
"4292360","4293740"," I'm like, what do you mean you're not coming out here?"
"4294560","4295900"," And they're like, we're not coming out there."
"4295960","4297600"," You have to go down to the police station to make a report."
"4298640","4299380"," I'm like, okay. "
"4300220","4301020"," Are you serious?"
"4301260","4302260"," They're like, yeah, I'm like, okay."
"4302260","4307400"," So I go down to the police station and I make a report, right?"
"4307520","4309680"," So I make a report of what looks like a stolen vehicle."
"4309980","4314120"," They start asking all kinds of questions like, could it have been the previous owner of the house?"
"4314520","4315440"," Are you sure it's stolen?"
"4316920","4319360"," Uh, did you get the VIN number off of this truck?"
"4319540","4321680"," And I'm like, I can't get the VIN and I don't know where there is. "
"4321940","4323080"," The doors are gone in this truck."
"4323620","4324420"," I didn't know there was a VIN."
"4324540","4325720"," There's like VIN numbers hidden. "
"4325960","4326700"," I didn't know any of that."
"4328040","4329320"," So they didn't come pick it up."
"4329320","4330260"," It just sat there. "
"4331860","4337320"," And the police officer tells me he goes, he goes, look, he's like, the chance of us coming to get"
"4337320","4338260"," it or slim to none."
"4339660","4342780"," He's like, call a tow company and have them come get it for you."
"4345320","4350260"," So I call two or three tow companies and they're like, oh, we're not coming to get that for you. "
"4350560","4351660"," Like, do you have the registration?"
"4352040","4352540"," I'm like, no."
"4353260","4354140"," And they're like, we're not coming."
"4354360","4354960"," And I'm like, okay. "
"4355420","4356400"," I'm kind of fucked here, right?"
"4357000","4358300"," So I call the police station again."
"4358300","4363020"," And I'm like, look, none of these tow trucks don't come get this thing before me, right?"
"4364920","4368540"," And these fucking the cops go, all right, do this."
"4369160","4375480"," They go, call the city and call the, uh, the blight department in the city and they'll, and they'll"
"4375480","4376420"," get rid of it for you. "
"4376580","4378140"," So I'm like, okay, sounds good to me."
"4378480","4380280"," I'm like, maybe it'd be like a year or two."
"4380840","4382960"," Maybe a year at this point, maybe one, two years. "
"4383800","4385480"," So I'm like, okay, that sounds great too."
"4385500","4386000"," I can do that."
"4386620","4389740"," I know Detroit's known for this blight department that's trying to clean up the city. "
"4389880","4390280"," I'll do that."
"4390620","4392800"," So I call the, I call the blight department."
"4393160","4394460"," This is a true fucking story. "
"4394460","4396680"," A little out here."
"4396780","4401260"," I want to make sure I don't get caught here in a, in a blast down kind of panicking now."
"4402620","4406400"," Cause we're, this is where they're like, oh, yeah, we're going to, we're going to hit these stops"
"4406400","4407380"," on these bulls here. "
"4407920","4411500"," So I'm like, so I call the blight department, take pictures."
"4412440","4415560"," And I just bought this house and I don't want this stolen car in this yard, right?"
"4416120","4420720"," Unless I'm trying to clean this house up and renovate it and strip it of all of its fucking garbage"
"4420720","4424440"," and, you know, make this thing nice, man."
"4424620","4426740"," Make some of your, make it so that somebody could live in it, right?"
"4427180","4428780"," Clean this neighborhood up kind of stuff. "
"4429340","4430840"," And I'm all gung-ho at this time."
"4431020","4434540"," I'm like, Hey, I'm going to help trade blah, blah, blah."
"4434640","4435280"," That kind of shit. "
"4436580","4438600"," So I think I can call the blight department."
"4438740","4439280"," I said in pictures."
"4440600","4444900"," Well, what they had done was they had sent a blight officer down to the house. "
"4445980","4448660"," The blight officer had taken pictures himself."
"4450020","4455480"," And, uh, I get a letter in the mail that the car still, the Nissan truck's still there."
"4456380","4459260"," And I get a letter in the mail that says you've been fined. "
"4459700","4463180"," I think it was 1500 bucks for blight on your property."
"4463680","4465920"," I'm like, what the fuck is this?"
"4466940","4475100"," Uh, and they're like for, for like, for like, um, uh, vehicles on your, on your property that are"
"4475100","4476200"," abandoned or something."
"4476940","4478320"," I get, I get a blight ticket. "
"4479180","4479640"," $1500."
"4480480","4484420"," Meanwhile, this fucking stolen vehicle is still in my yard, right?"
"4485400","4489100"," So I make a rod still sitting the garage, garage doors off to the side."
"4489580","4490620"," And I get this blight ticket. "
"4492860","4494220"," So I have to show up to court."
"4496680","4498180"," So I show up to court."
"4498840","4500940"," And at this point, I'm fucking pissed. "
"4500940","4502940"," I am so fucking pissed."
"4503540","4505360"," I can't get the fucking cops there."
"4505620","4507720"," I can't get the fucking tow trucks there. "
"4507820","4510700"," I can't get the fucking blight department to do anything for me."
"4511040","4511960"," And I just got a ticket."
"4512380","4513580"," So I'm like, wait a minute. "
"4514060","4518960"," I'm trying to fucking, I'm bringing money into this city and I'm hiring local workers, doing"
"4518960","4520380"," everything that I possibly can."
"4521220","4522980"," Uh, and I'm getting bent over here."
"4523400","4525220"," I'm getting bent right over and fucked. "
"4525980","4528620"," And then the time, of course, you know, you're going to stop everything you're doing."
"4528620","4530580"," And then get out here to this, this blight hearing."
"4531140","4538280"," So I'm inside the blight hearing, uh, in the court room and, and, uh, the, the, I'm trying to"
"4538280","4545400"," explain myself and the blight officers talking about how, um, how it was, how I was like, I called"
"4545400","4546180"," the blight department. "
"4546300","4547920"," They're like, the blad officers like, no, he didn't."
"4548120","4549020"," Somebody else reported it."
"4549440","4551180"," I'm like, like, this is a stolen car. "
"4551520","4552680"," I'm like, I reported it."
"4553600","4556500"," And so the blight officers giving his testimony."
"4556500","4558880"," And I, I asked, I had no attorney with me. "
"4558900","4562400"," And I'm just like, I want to know who fucking said, I don't know who said this to you."
"4562740","4563040"," Right."
"4563080","4565920"," And then they're like, uh, that my, my email address. "
"4565980","4567460"," And I'm like, well, that's my email."
"4568520","4569920"," I'm like, that's my email."
"4569940","4571820"," That's my phone number on my phone. "
"4572240","4575980"," And that's my, that's my wife that contacted you."
"4576320","4576680"," Right."
"4576800","4578000"," It was actually my wife that contacted. "
"4578560","4580920"," And, uh, I'm like, that's me."
"4581820","4582440"," That's me."
"4584060","4587780"," So I don't have to pay the, I don't have to end up not having to pay the blight ticket,"
"4587840","4589760"," but they still wouldn't take it off my property. "
"4590660","4592340"," They still wouldn't take it off my property."
"4592660","4595240"," So after I went through all this, had paperwork from the police department."
"4596140","4598880"," And, uh, from the court and all the stuff. "
"4601020","4602280"," Dude, what is going on here?"
"4602360","4603140"," Are we going to go up or what?"
"4603660","4604320"," I mean, seriously."
"4606460","4607420"," Stop fucking around."
"4607660","4608000"," Let's go. "
"4608300","4608720"," Get up there."
"4609460","4610300"," Get up there."
"4610400","4610980"," Where's my weights?"
"4616500","4617040"," All right. "
"4617040","4618560"," So I'm going to do the back."
"4618700","4620580"," I didn't, I haven't done these in a couple of days."
"4620720","4621040"," I don't think. "
"4621460","4622380"," No, I did those yesterday."
"4622580","4623160"," I can feel them."
"4623240","4623600"," Hold on here. "
"4626500","4627760"," Let me just do, let me do this."
"4627880","4628380"," These right here."
"4628580","4629000"," Oh, yeah. "
"4630420","4631340"," Oh, yeah."
"4632620","4634180"," I'm tired of waiting around."
"4635120","4637160"," We need to get higher right now. "
"4638140","4638940"," Hold on a second."
"4639080","4642020"," If you're in your living room or if you're in your office, just watch out."
"4642620","4644740"," They're going to make my money back from yesterday. "
"4645780","4646980"," So I'm sitting there."
"4647920","4650640"," At this point, I'm like, Oh, fuck me, right?"
"4650960","4652540"," I'm getting fucked over right now."
"4653060","4653780"," Hold on a second here. "
"4653820","4654300"," I can feel it."
"4654700","4656380"," Hold on a second."
"4657220","4660360"," This is the hand that I use on the mouse. "
"4661560","4665900"," Oh, I'm going to make sure that hand stays nice and strong here."
"4667600","4673460"," Get up there and pay me my fucking money that you took from yesterday."
"4673460","4679280"," Take all that money from these dirty, skanky bears. "
"4679620","4681280"," They're like, Oh, we're walking away with Captain's money yesterday."
"4681460","4684100"," I'm like, you ain't walking away with shit."
"4685480","4687260"," Shit was in your pocket for one day. "
"4687420","4687720"," It's back."
"4689140","4689860"," All right."
"4693180","4694540"," So, so this is what I do. "
"4696950","4699250"," I pull a totally Detroit thing like now."
"4699410","4699890"," I'm like, all right."
"4700050","4701010"," I'm like, all right. "
"4701090","4702310"," I'm like, I'm like, all right."
"4702470","4702910"," Here's the deal."
"4707130","4708210"," I'm like, here's the deal. "
"4708450","4712590"," I'm like, I'm like, I am, I am fucking out of my elements here in this city."
"4714130","4715850"," I'm like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing."
"4715850","4717370"," I have to adapt and overcome. "
"4719150","4721270"," I have to become a city dweller from Detroit."
"4722170","4725710"," So what I do, I end up finding a, come on."
"4725830","4726790"," Give me that cross, baby. "
"4728230","4729750"," Give me that cross."
"4731250","4733390"," Give me that little white line right there."
"4736660","4737540"," So what do I do?"
"4738840","4745830"," I go on Craigslist and I find like a neighborhood tow truck. "
"4746250","4750790"," These guys like, these guys have a tow truck, but they don't have license."
"4751090","4753970"," And these are, this is like your local neighborhood tow truck driver."
"4754350","4759410"," These guys are like, come tell your, they're like, you don't have AAA or if you don't have, uh, I"
"4759410","4759690"," don't know. "
"4759970","4761490"," Good Sam's club or something."
"4762090","4765930"," And you break down, like, if you're in a city, right, especially a city that's trying to, trying to"
"4765930","4767050"," make a leg up in itself."
"4767050","4767910"," Trying to get somewhere. "
"4768250","4769710"," And they don't have normal services."
"4769790","4770910"," There are local service."
"4771030","4774710"," Like you can find anything like in a city like this, you can find whatever you want. "
"4774990","4778410"," So I went on Craigslist and I found the local tow truck driver."
"4779870","4782330"," And he was like, same question, right?"
"4782510","4785310"," He actually shows up and he's like, he got the registration on this thing."
"4785310","4786110"," And I'm like, nope. "
"4787310","4788290"," No, I don't."
"4789290","4793790"," I go, but I do have a paperwork in the police department, the blight department."
"4794450","4798110"," Like all this shit that I went through and I started telling him the story. "
"4799390","4802990"," And he's like, look, man, he's, I'm like, these police are told me they're coming to get this"
"4802990","4803170"," thing."
"4803270","4804710"," The blight department told me to kiss their balls."
"4805370","4806610"," All kinds of shit like that. "
"4807010","4808650"," And I'm like, I'm stuck here."
"4808950","4810710"," I'm like, please just get out of my yard."
"4810910","4815450"," This guy, like through, through the hook in the back and just dragged it out, like scraping the"
"4815450","4816650"," concrete floor in the garage. "
"4817450","4821730"," Hooked it up, dragged it in the back, back of his, uh, back of his flat bed and he was"
"4821730","4822310"," out of there."
"4822310","4822870"," Gone."
"4824490","4829250"," So I finally figured out how to get rid of a stolen vehicle in the city of Detroit. "
"4829610","4830890"," That's that you know is stolen."
"4831350","4832590"," And this guy doesn't have a registration."
"4833230","4834470"," I have no idea where it went. "
"4834810","4835890"," This is years ago now."
"4836090","4839390"," So, uh, but at that point, I don't know what else I could have done."
"4842350","4847310"," So I guess I have some experience with if this thing doesn't get picked up. "
"4849610","4851290"," Come on plane, baby."
"4851870","4855490"," You see this John, they're trying to, uh, trying to, trying to stop."
"4855650","4857530"," They're trying to stop this from happening right now. "
"4857590","4858190"," You're watching this."
"4858950","4860870"," Trying to stop this from happening right now."
"4861010","4862370"," Look at them dirty dogs. "
"4864730","4866270"," They're trying right now."
"4866370","4866690"," They're best."
"4867590","4868930"," They're these sellers, man. "
"4869150","4870210"," They're trying their best."
"4871710","4872750"," Come on plane."
"4875370","4877170"," Dude, they don't want this to happen here. "
"4877170","4879090"," You see how they're trying to throw this over right now?"
"4883210","4884690"," They don't want it to happen."
"4884870","4886050"," Dude, my stops are going to be."
"4886210","4888350"," I'm moving my stops way the fuck on down here. "
"4889230","4890470"," I'll just add to this."
"4892770","4895230"," These fucking sellers trying their best right now."
"4895390","4896850"," They're like, we're not going up any higher. "
"4900560","4901980"," Rage, seller rage right here."
"4902080","4903400"," This is, they don't want to see this happen."
"4904140","4905720"," They don't want to see this go any higher here. "
"4908870","4913570"," You see how they see that reaction once the once the one minute crosses the five here."
"4914590","4916670"," They're trying to throw this back down again."
"4916750","4918450"," They want to see us come back down. "
"4918550","4922710"," They don't want to see us be bullish even on a one in five minute above."
"4923630","4926190"," So they're like, they're like, nope, nope."
"4926490","4928530"," We want to send this right down if we can. "
"4934270","4935490"," It definitely crashed."
"4943040","4943700"," So, yeah."
"4944000","4944340"," So I don't know. "
"4944420","4949100"," I guess that's what that's what I've gotten in store for myself at some point today is we'll find"
"4949100","4954100"," out if what's that's been I think it's been hasn't been five years that I forget about the COVID"
"4954100","4954380"," years."
"4955380","4956460"," The COVID years, man."
"4956800","4959260"," Like I feel like the COVID years didn't happen. "
"4959260","4962120"," It was like pre COVID and then no COVID."
"4963120","4967520"," So like right now, I'm like, I'm not even a accountant for the two or three years of COVID, man."
"4967520","4970520"," And like the COVID years just kind of added. "
"4970700","4972240"," I'm like, I've only been here for five years."
"4972240","4974360"," Now I'm like, oh, maybe it's been another two years."
"4975720","4979940"," And I'm like, oh, maybe it's maybe I've been here seven years now. "
"4980780","4982820"," I think maybe I've been here that long."
"4983920","4985200"," So we'll see how this works."
"4985480","4988020"," So I don't it's just since that time period. "
"4988320","4995040"," I wonder if the police will actually come and toe the vehicle like has the city improved to a point"
"4995040","4995500"," where."
"4996240","4999640"," They'll just come get it, maybe take a report on the scene or something."
"5000520","5002820"," If it sits there, I will put a timer on it. "
"5003000","5004340"," Maybe I'll start decorating it."
"5004960","5006400"," That's what that would be funny too, right?"
"5006500","5010720"," If I put some like decorations on it and shit and just made it like a permanent fixture."
"5020380","5021500"," No, no, no, I'll show you guys. "
"5021800","5023420"," I'll show you guys what to look for for a crash."
"5025040","5026600"," I'll show you guys what you're looking for."
"5026980","5029220"," I just need to go out of this fucking trade at some point. "
"5029920","5035360"," Just wasting my time here for the eventual, the eventual melt up right here."
"5044540","5046380"," We should get this melt up here at some point."
"5047620","5049920"," Just waiting on these fucking bears to sell. "
"5057150","5060210"," Run the van, find the owner, build 200 bucks a day for storage."
"5060450","5061070"," Never thought of that."
"5062730","5063930"," Never thought of doing that. "
"5064130","5065470"," Find the van and build, build the owner."
"5066230","5066850"," I should have done that."
"5066990","5069470"," How I should have tried to find the original owner of the of the truck. "
"5071480","5072560"," I was kind of paranoid."
"5072700","5072940"," I'll be honest."
"5072940","5078260"," The first Nissan truck that I found, it was like an SUV kind of a truck, like hybrid or something. "
"5079120","5080040"," I'll be honest with you."
"5080080","5080700"," I first found it."
"5080820","5082660"," I was like, these guys are going to think I stole it. "
"5083100","5088920"," It was like these, because if you live anywhere else, the police are like, first they point a"
"5088920","5089660"," finger at you first."
"5090080","5091320"," They're like, you reported it."
"5091360","5092300"," You probably did it. "
"5093000","5096940"," So I'm like, uh, the trade, they don't even fucking care."
"5097080","5098200"," I mean, that doesn't care."
"5098360","5098620"," They care. "
"5099000","5101400"," But they're dealing with all kinds of other crazy shit."
"5102440","5102880"," Right?"
"5102960","5107340"," It's kind of a place where, um, we've got to actually have a great police department."
"5107880","5111580"," I'm going to give them some, some respect here because I know some police departments. "
"5111900","5112580"," They won't even help you."
"5113120","5114360"," They will help you here."
"5114460","5121000"," If you're in like, uh, if you're in like, um, uh, like life or limb kind of a situation, they"
"5121000","5121440"," will come help. "
"5122280","5123960"," I have another story on that shit."
"5124260","5125460"," I'll tell that story, dude."
"5125580","5127180"," I got all kinds of fucked up stories in Detroit. "
"5127980","5128320"," Uh."
"5131180","5134440"," They will actually come help you if you say the right things."
"5134680","5138300"," Uh, they'll come, they'll come help you, but they're dealing with that kind of shit here. "
"5138300","5140080"," Uh, so, you know, you got it."
"5140220","5141640"," They can only fight so many fires."
"5142920","5144720"," You know, trying to, trying to save the city. "
"5145460","5147000"," And they don't get paid well here either."
"5147000","5148220"," So I got to give them some respect."
"5148460","5149380"," And you know, it's all crazy. "
"5150200","5157140"," We didn't have, um, we didn't have big, uh, riots here or big protests here like you saw in other"
"5157140","5157460"," cities."
"5158620","5161520"," Detroit was kind of already, already went through that years ago."
"5161780","5165160"," So, like, Detroit's like pretty progressive city. "
"5165960","5167740"," Um, it's not, it still has its issues."
"5167920","5169540"," Like, like every place with people."
"5170040","5172920"," Uh, but Detroit's, Detroit's doing quite well. "
"5173380","5175720"," Uh, relative to what you've seen in other cities."
"5177380","5182040"," Uh, there, there's like this protest and stuff, but no riots, none of that craziness."
"5182780","5187280"," Um, the police department tries to work with the community here, generally speaking. "
"5188180","5189880"," You'll see some people argue against it."
"5190000","5190340"," That's true."
"5190540","5192520"," But it, it, the pudding is there. "
"5194500","5197020"," Uh, and you generally see the police trying to do good."
"5197200","5197480"," Good job."
"5197620","5198800"," They way, they're way underfunded. "
"5198980","5201000"," These guys can make way better money outside of the city."
"5202460","5204720"," And way nicer communities and they choose to serve."
"5205860","5206660"," Uh, the city. "
"5209670","5212410"," Now, but at one time, the city was, they had a real rough go of it, right?"
"5213190","5215750"," They had a guy named Kwame, uh, Calpatrick."
"5216350","5217170"," I think it's Kwame, Calpatrick."
"5217290","5217870"," I think that was his name. "
"5218590","5221130"," And there was some really horrible things going on in the city."
"5227710","5230230"," But I have a funny story about the police here."
"5230730","5231810"," This is a true story too. "
"5231990","5232530"," I guess I'll cut it."
"5232670","5233670"," I should tell some of these stories."
"5234430","5236590"," I haven't told all these stories and some of these are really good. "
"5237010","5238270"," That's a good police story."
"5238610","5240530"," So I got a good story."
"5241410","5244890"," Uh, so I bought another house and I've got a tenants in it, right?"
"5245830","5246990"," And I know the neighbor. "
"5247970","5249050"," Uh, she was a little old lady."
"5250170","5250470"," She's not old."
"5250470","5251390"," Well, she's kind of older. "
"5251610","5253550"," She's like mid 60s, mid 70s."
"5254570","5255630"," And, uh, she's older."
"5257010","5259530"," And, uh, we had asked her to watch the house for us. "
"5260070","5264970"," And we were like, we'll pay your water bill for you if you watch the house for us while we"
"5264970","5265470"," renovate it."
"5265830","5268530"," And, um, if anything happens, we just give us a call."
"5269170","5270550"," Cause you can't trust the police, right?"
"5270770","5271110"," Property crime. "
"5271290","5272050"," You can't trust the police."
"5272650","5276290"," They're busy chasing down, uh, real criminals and stuff."
"5276290","5278790"," And so we became friends with her. "
"5280310","5282050"," And, uh, so we're friends with this woman."
"5282390","5285230"," And, uh, she didn't have a husband or anything."
"5285470","5286510"," She just lived there alone. "
"5287450","5289270"," And, uh, still friends with it today."
"5289930","5291430"," And, uh, she had a home invasion."
"5292870","5293630"," One night. "
"5294090","5297950"," And, uh, this is a crazy story."
"5298870","5300390"," So she had a home invasion one night."
"5302130","5304830"," And, uh, she calls me in the middle of the night. "
"5304830","5307290"," It's like 11, 11.30 at night or something like that."
"5307770","5308750"," And I got a phone call."
"5309230","5310810"," And, well, I think she calls my wife or something. "
"5311330","5313170"," And, uh, this is a true story, dude."
"5314230","5315950"," I get a phone call in the middle of the night."
"5316230","5319370"," She's like, um, she's like someone broke into my house. "
"5320550","5326630"," Um, and he came into the house and, uh, I'm afraid that he's still here."
"5326890","5334750"," So I had over there in the middle."
"5335910","5337250"," And she's like, I saw him. "
"5338730","5339710"," Uh, so I'm like, okay."
"5339950","5340970"," I'm like, I'll be right over."
"5341230","5342030"," And I know it's Detroit. "
"5342310","5343950"," So I'm like, uh, am I please cut her?"
"5344090","5345150"," Might or may or may not come."
"5346910","5348850"," So I head over there in the middle of the night."
"5348970","5350570"," It's like 11.30, 12 o'clock at night. "
"5351590","5352310"," So I head over there."
"5353370","5358910"," And, uh, ain't it walking the house outside?"
"5360030","5362610"," She's standing in the doorway of the house."
"5362850","5365350"," The door is ripped off the hinges to the side a little bit. "
"5365350","5368510"," And, uh, she's in her nightgown."
"5369690","5371330"," And, uh, I was like, come outside."
"5371870","5372470"," So she comes outside. "
"5373410","5376810"," I walk around the front, the back of the house, search the backyard, search her garage."
"5377490","5379210"," She's got big, long grass in the backyard."
"5379450","5379930"," Search all that. "
"5380650","5381350"," Come around the back end."
"5382110","5383590"," And I see around the side of the house."
"5384990","5387210"," I see a glowing phone. "
"5387790","5388050"," This is true."
"5388710","5390090"," A glowing phone in the tall grass."
"5391170","5393070"," I pull the phone out and I put it in my pocket. "
"5393070","5397610"," And then I go inside the house and I sweep the house, right?"
"5398070","5405670"," So I start, um, I start, uh, there's this thing where you, um, I feel what it's called now, but"
"5405670","5407250"," it's called a packing or something."
"5407510","5410210"," It's when you look around corners and you check every corner of the room."
"5410650","5413370"," So I check every corner of each room, sweep each room clear. "
"5413930","5415270"," While it's there, check the second floor."
"5415690","5416330"," Nobody in the house."
"5417110","5417930"," And she's still outside. "
"5418930","5420190"," So I come back outside to see her."
"5421510","5423990"," And, uh, she's like cold."
"5424230","5424850"," She's got a night down. "
"5425030","5427330"," It's a little, little after American lady, beautiful woman."
"5427970","5428830"," She's got a hair done and all that."
"5429590","5432310"," And, um, like there's nobody inside the house. "
"5432730","5434350"," I'm like, I'll call the police."
"5435290","5437890"," And meanwhile, this phone is in my pocket and it's just blowing up."
"5438030","5439590"," It's just like buzzing and ringing or whatever. "
"5440270","5441530"," And I'm like, I'm like, ah, shit."
"5441630","5441970"," I got this phone."
"5442110","5445670"," I pull the phone out of my pocket and it's like ringing or something. "
"5447090","5448650"," Uh, so I answer it."
"5450390","5451490"," And, uh, it's a woman."
"5451850","5454250"," And she's like, is this so-and-so. "
"5454610","5456390"," And I'm like, uh, I'm like, no."
"5458150","5459250"," And she's like, who is this?"
"5461430","5463650"," And I go, I go, well, I just found this."
"5463870","5466170"," I was like, I just found this phone in the grass. "
"5466890","5467570"," I just picked it up."
"5467690","5468690"," I don't, I was like, I don't know."
"5469770","5472630"," And she's like, well, he'll be there to come get it just a few minutes. "
"5473390","5476450"," And I was like, oh, well, I'm sitting out of, then I give the house address."
"5477410","5479690"," And I'm like, I'm sitting out front of this house and I've got his phone."
"5479690","5481450"," She's like, he'll be right there to come get it. "
"5481810","5484230"," Now, she had asked me if I was him or something."
"5484690","5487590"," But at this point, I realized that he's probably with her, right?"
"5487990","5488690"," So I'm like, okay."
"5488990","5489830"," I'm like, come get your phone. "
"5491430","5493070"," So I hang up the phone with her, right?"
"5493910","5496550"," And I call the police on my phone, 911."
"5497470","5501050"," And I tell the police, I'm like, hey, I'm like, you just got a call from this woman."
"5502130","5504450"," I'm like, and I just came over here to check on her. "
"5504570","5505410"," Your guys aren't here yet."
"5505410","5510030"," I'm like, I just found a, I just found a, I was like, I just found a phone in the"
"5510030","5510250"," grass."
"5510490","5511850"," And I think it was the guy that broke in. "
"5512470","5516330"," And I guess this guy like broken in like gone to the top of the stairs, seen her in there,"
"5516390","5516910"," grabbed her."
"5517550","5519870"," And then had fled out of the house."
"5520630","5521750"," This is true fucking story. "
"5522070","5523830"," So I'm on the phone with the police."
"5523850","5525010"," I'm like, I got this guy's phone."
"5525150","5526470"," This guy says, come back right now. "
"5526630","5527530"," Get your asses down here."
"5529430","5531590"," So the police actually come."
"5532010","5532670"," And I'm like, I'm outside. "
"5533750","5535330"," I'm like, this guy is probably dangerous."
"5536410","5537530"," And he's probably going to do something."
"5538790","5543130"," So before this guy gets back there, the police actually show up to get two cops in a car. "
"5544190","5544310"," Right?"
"5544710","5547010"," And I'm like, they show up and they're scared."
"5547150","5548990"," They like they're going to get ambushed or something."
"5549850","5551330"," And this is true. "
"5552690","5556650"," And I'm like, park your car over there behind that house where the hedges are."
"5558130","5561010"," And the police parked their car behind the side of this house."
"5563200","5565280"," And I held the phone in my hand. "
"5565360","5567240"," They're like, hold the phone in your hands and we're going to hide over here."
"5567380","5570560"," So these two police officers hid behind some bushes."
"5572000","5574320"," And this guy came walking up the road. "
"5575340","5578720"," Like around a corner and then up to step the block, right?"
"5578960","5581920"," There's a bunch of trees here and stuff that they call it like the city of trees and shit."
"5584140","5586660"," And this guy actually came back to the house."
"5586860","5591700"," This guy that broke in this home invader came back to get his phone. "
"5593100","5597460"," And he's he's blowing up the phone as he's coming closer, right?"
"5597640","5601040"," The phone's like glowing and like buzzing in my hand and stuff."
"5602560","5607400"," And the police can see this guy calling me."
"5607460","5611780"," And this guy's walking up the block to me and he's talking as he's walking towards me. "
"5613020","5614820"," He's like, you got my phone, don't you?"
"5615100","5616440"," And he's he's doing this, right?"
"5616640","5617820"," And you can see the phone glowing."
"5618020","5618840"," That's all the police needed."
"5619580","5624480"," And they came out like they came out like you like just like a fucking TV show, like, you know,"
"5624520","5624840"," like freeze. "
"5625220","5626180"," All that kind of stuff."
"5626560","5627980"," Guns drawn and everything."
"5630720","5632940"," And this is true story. "
"5634020","5638380"," This fucking guy was not only come back to get his fucking phone and but not only that, but to"
"5638380","5639160"," threaten her, right?"
"5639800","5641520"," He probably knew the police weren't coming back."
"5642620","5649020"," And the key here is that I had said, what I had said to the police earlier, the key point"
"5649020","5653440"," here is I told the police that my wife and children with me when we came to check up on"
"5653440","5653820"," this lady."
"5654380","5656680"," I think if I hadn't said that, they weren't there with me. "
"5656760","5659260"," But if I hadn't said that, they might not have shown up."
"5659420","5663260"," But as soon as you mentioned women and children, he's fucking police will be right there."
"5664440","5665560"," So they were, hold on a second here. "
"5668790","5669730"," I guess I'm going to message."
"5674720","5676000"," Hey, hey, Tom, one second here."
"5686620","5687720"," All right, hold on a second here. "
"5687780","5688280"," I'm getting interrupted."
"5688840","5689560"," It's a good interruption."
"5690300","5693040"," My younger star just told me that she's getting two A pluses. "
"5694200","5697000"," And she's going to get three A pluses in five minutes."
"5697800","5698720"," So I'm very excited."
"5699080","5700140"," She's doing very well in school. "
"5701160","5702520"," So I'm sitting there."
"5703500","5707360"," And oh, whoa, whoa."
"5710500","5714360"," Oh, what happened to that blood into the minutes today?"
"5714960","5716040"," I ain't seeing that blood. "
"5716340","5717440"," We don't get a lot of time here."
"5717860","5719780"," It's goddamn bull's going to get a move on here."
"5721920","5723720"," So, so this is the crazy part, right?"
"5724400","5725300"," This guy had note. "
"5725460","5727800"," This guy just this fucking guy."
"5727920","5728920"," No, I shouldn't be saying F."
"5729160","5731080"," But so I'm still long calls here."
"5731140","5733400"," It's a dollar two 400 C's. "
"5734100","5735360"," I want to see a squeeze hired."
"5735660","5736700"," I want to see the squeeze higher."
"5736700","5738820"," So I ain't selling shit here. "
"5741360","5744400"," This guy walked around with impunity."
"5744760","5746080"," This guy broke right into her house."
"5746580","5748480"," This guy scared the shit out of her. "
"5748580","5750320"," He's like holding her at the top of the stairs."
"5751500","5753120"," He came back to the house with impunity."
"5753680","5755580"," Probably thought these police aren't coming here. "
"5757060","5758720"," And didn't give two fine fucks."
"5758900","5759660"," And probably came back."
"5759840","5761380"," Well, my view came back to threaten her. "
"5761460","5762000"," Grab the phone."
"5762880","5764660"," Probably threaten me and threaten her."
"5764660","5768500"," And be like, you know, and he's, and what I find out later is I find out some shit later. "
"5768680","5769840"," So they arrest this guy."
"5770400","5773920"," And my neighbors afraid to prosecute to, to."
"5775900","5777480"," Because she's afraid of retribution. "
"5777480","5778920"," He'll come back together or whatever."
"5781210","5782630"," As I find that out later."
"5782870","5786650"," And then I find out this guy, the actual prosecutor wasn't supposed to tell me, but this guy did"
"5786650","5787290"," live nearby. "
"5789870","5792710"," Like a victim's, a victim's right counselor or something."
"5792710","5800830"," And I got a phone call a month later where the prosecutor and the victim's right person."
"5801550","5803710"," I guess it's like a victim's right person or something like that. "
"5804590","5809910"," And they're like, look, she doesn't want to, to testify against this guy."
"5810050","5811010"," She's afraid of retribution."
"5811770","5813350"," It's like it's very common in Detroit. "
"5814090","5818650"," People will come back to get you for a turn in the men, right?"
"5818770","5820130"," You're not supposed to turn people in."
"5820130","5822070"," And I was like, fuck this."
"5822250","5823170"," I'm like, I'll fucking testify. "
"5823770","5826450"," So I went rolled down to the prosecutor's office."
"5827110","5829410"," And I was like, look, I was like, why does she afraid?"
"5829670","5833910"," And she's like, well, this guy lives like, you know, within a mile of where she lives."
"5834050","5836070"," So I actually testified against this guy. "
"5836410","5836870"," Believe it or not."
"5837150","5838030"," I've never done that in my life."
"5838030","5842430"," And I did it that time because I was like, this lady shouldn't be afraid for her, uh, well-being"
"5842430","5842870"," or safety. "
"5843450","5844450"," And that kind of shit."
"5844690","5848050"," People shouldn't, people shouldn't be able to walk around and threaten some little old lady."
"5848650","5851090"," Where she lives and owns a house and stuff like that. "
"5852350","5853770"," So I testified against this guy."
"5853890","5855730"," They convicted this guy of home invasion."
"5856790","5858110"," And I don't feel what it was. "
"5858230","5860510"," It wasn't actually, there's like a special term for it or something."
"5862270","5865590"," That was my other Detroit story about when you want the police there."
"5865910","5868950"," And my point here is, if you ever need the police there and you're in a city. "
"5869870","5873330"," If you live in a city, you just say I have what wife and children here."
"5873690","5876230"," And they'll be there, like instantaneously."
"5881240","5882460"," Yeah, I understand desperation. "
"5882780","5883600"," I get it."
"5883700","5884560"," I get people are desperate."
"5886480","5889020"," I have full compassion for being desperate. "
"5889300","5889940"," I'll tell you what, man."
"5891720","5895240"," If that guy hadn't come back, I wouldn't have cared like break in."
"5895400","5896800"," You find somebody in the house or something. "
"5897080","5897620"," No big deal."
"5898500","5901440"," She hadn't been violated or anything like that."
"5901540","5904520"," But the moment that guy came back and was like, I'll do whatever the fuck I want. "
"5904660","5906720"," I was like, Oh, no, man, that's not happening."
"5907160","5909660"," I was like, this ain't happening."
"5911760","5913860"," This is a crazy part of the story too. "
"5914140","5915440"," When the police came, right?"
"5916320","5920920"," So the minutes before that guy came back when the police showed up, the police didn't believe my"
"5920920","5922360"," story when I called them."
"5923140","5925060"," They didn't believe it was actually his phone."
"5925480","5928940"," And then while it's blowing up while the police are there and they're like, I can't believe this"
"5928940","5930260"," guy's coming back here right now. "
"5930540","5935300"," So we're talking briefly before the guy comes back and I'm like, dude, I can't believe this guy's"
"5935300","5936000"," coming back either."
"5936160","5937560"," This guy has no fear."
"5937700","5939900"," This guy gives two flying flucks. "
"5941340","5943980"," He doesn't believe for a minute that the police are coming back here."
"5944400","5947460"," And these police officers are like, how stupid can you be?"
"5948580","5953520"," When I was down at the prosecutor's office, once I finally talked to prosecutors, I can't believe"
"5953520","5954700"," this guy actually came back."
"5956240","5961460"," That guy could have claimed he lost his phone walking through a yard that he wasn't the guy, right?"
"5962300","5966360"," Like it could have, like any number of reasons that guy could have just not never shown back up. "
"5966980","5967720"," And he would have been fine."
"5971140","5972900"," And it was really weird, really bizarre."
"5973360","5979220"," Like the guy, if the guy had just never come back for his phone, probably not a case against him. "
"5980820","5982520"," And it was really wild to see that."
"5982660","5983740"," It was how bizarre, dude."
"5984380","5986440"," The tradesmen have a bizarre place without a doubt. "
"5991700","5996180"," So he's telling that you shot someone, they show up and ask where the guy is the guy that you're"
"5996180","5998200"," shooting someone is the same excuse as I'm being busy."
"6008220","6009200"," Yeah, that was bizarre."
"6011770","6013150"," Or say the suspect is black. "
"6013350","6014370"," No, so you guys don't."
"6014530","6016770"," So we'll have a saying or say the suspect is black."
"6017470","6019170"," Police will be there with their guns blazing. "
"6019730","6021530"," I think that's probably true other places."
"6022190","6023490"," Detroit's on all black city."
"6023670","6024970"," I'm a minority here. "
"6025270","6026950"," This is an all black city."
"6028170","6030810"," Black police, black politicians, black."
"6031890","6032530"," Everyone here. "
"6032750","6032910"," Everyone."
"6033090","6034350"," I'm a minority here."
"6034550","6035410"," A very small minority. "
"6036150","6041530"," I'm going to say most 97% of my friends here are all black people, African American, African"
"6041530","6042290"," American descent."
"6043190","6045550"," I don't live in white neighborhoods or anything like that."
"6045810","6047730"," My kids go to black schools. "
"6049150","6052430"," We are integrated 100%."
"6053690","6058030"," So I don't know about those things that happen in white neighborhoods and shit."
"6058170","6059450"," That shit doesn't happen here like that. "
"6059450","6060630"," In my experience, at least."
"6061230","6062930"," Though it does happen outside of here."
"6062990","6069130"," I've got some very close African American friends here in Detroit and I'm shocked at some of the"
"6069130","6073210"," racism that I see outside of the city, outside of the city of Detroit itself. "
"6075090","6077370"," I'm quite, quite offended by it as well."
"6079510","6081890"," But here in the city, I don't see it as much."
"6084780","6086620"," Maybe, maybe that does happen here. "
"6087280","6087720"," Possible."
"6088100","6092200"," I think at one time it did happen here in mass."
"6092420","6094100"," I think in the 60s and 70s. "
"6094740","6100780"," So there was a, there was a time here where there's some real bad shit that happened to African"
"6100780","6104920"," Americans and black people, generational kind of destruction, right?"
"6105140","6106300"," You send all the dads to prison."
"6107220","6108480"," You send the grandfathers to prison."
"6109080","6115400"," You put these kids with no dad at home and you destroy the school system and before you know it,"
"6115540","6119060"," you're generational destruction of an entire culture. "
"6119480","6122100"," That happened here in Detroit, definitely."
"6123380","6124740"," But they're rebuilding, man."
"6124940","6125980"," These people are rebuilding here. "
"6126100","6126820"," They're doing their best."
"6127500","6133400"," So I'm going to give mad respect to the residents of Detroit 100%."
"6133940","6136660"," But that did happen here at one time, man. "
"6136840","6144120"," It was really ugly what they did to people that long, long, long generational citizens of the city"
"6144120","6144440"," of Detroit."
"6145080","6145840"," Got the shaft."
"6154690","6155570"," Yeah, they are. "
"6156850","6157750"," They're very nice."
"6157970","6160330"," They're like, I consider them my brothers."
"6160630","6162810"," I break bread with these guys, women. "
"6163450","6166490"," We have parties together, birthday parties."
"6166950","6168790"," We have celebrate holidays together."
"6171330","6172710"," We're very close. "
"6173670","6177450"," Just as close as they would be with any other person out there."
"6178210","6181150"," I eat the same restaurants with these guys and hang out with them."
"6181550","6182670"," They work with me. "
"6182770","6185130"," We renovate houses together."
"6185750","6186910"," It's all normal."
"6187950","6189110"," Just like anybody else. "
"6190830","6192870"," My kids get a great education, right?"
"6193170","6194330"," They get a great cultural education."
"6195490","6197310"," They get their schooling, same thing."
"6198750","6201510"," So they're able to experience other cultures. "
"6202550","6205330"," I hope that it helps them in life, too, right, to be better people."
"6206430","6208490"," Treat people with respect, freedom as they are."
"6209310","6209830"," I don't know. "
"6209910","6211310"," I've had a great experience here in Detroit."
"6213250","6214710"," I got nothing bad to say, man."
"6215130","6215490"," Zero. "
"6215790","6216710"," They're just like anybody else."
"6218070","6218690"," Could you not?"
"6218850","6223190"," Like you go into like a poor white neighborhood or wherever somewhere else, even in the middle."
"6223410","6225690"," Matter of fact, I've lived in very wealthy places. "
"6226290","6230950"," I've seen some, I've seen worse shit in those places than some of the shit I've seen here in"
"6230950","6231130"," Detroit."
"6232610","6233750"," Like wealthy people get away with."
"6240060","6242420"," Yeah, I don't notice that stuff here at all. "
"6244300","6246840"," But it could be because it's Detroit, too."
"6251340","6252760"," I don't experience it here."
"6265100","6266860"," Yeah, my calls are still five-man. "
"6266940","6268120"," We're at 93 cents right now."
"6268600","6271200"," I've just taken some time here, so I'm meant to try to squeeze higher."
"6272280","6280240"," I'm meant for 90 cents and $1.03. I'm just waiting for this to squeeze higher, this ball to roll"
"6280240","6280800"," off the market. "
"6293360","6302070"," Yeah, I'm not a, I've got, I'm not a, I was in the army, like I was in the army,"
"6302070","6302370"," man."
"6302530","6305010"," I don't like, I only believe in the color green."
"6305370","6314860"," Like I don't believe in, I feel like a lot of that stuff, man, is intended to divide us, man. "
"6315200","6322460"," And especially now, the one thing that bothers me supremely is, it's now a class warfare kind of a"
"6322460","6326780"," thing, too, against the class warfare that goes on out there."
"6327420","6330560"," It's, it's, it's just that they don't care what color you are, they care it."
"6330940","6334420"," It's, it's this class warfare that we're devouring each other. "
"6335420","6336020"," It's brutal."
"6338950","6340930"," Class warfare, all-time highs in my eyes."
"6341070","6342470"," I've never seen it quite like this. "
"6346030","6348430"," You're, you're, the intent is to make you eat each other."
"6348730","6349350"," You see it on Twitter."
"6350130","6350930"," You can see it on Twitter. "
"6351110","6352050"," It's, it's vicious."
"6355420","6356920"," It's, it's violent and vicious."
"6357680","6358480"," It's bizarre. "
"6371140","6372240"," Yeah, it's the media, man."
"6372380","6373260"," It's, it's bizarre."
"6373480","6373820"," You know, it's funny. "
"6373960","6379260"," I was talking to a friend last, talking to a friend last night of the program."
"6379940","6381060"," And, you know, it's a good thing."
"6381200","6382260"," Here's a great one. "
"6383200","6386780"," So, you know, I was talking to a friend last night and I was like, man, there's a group of"
"6386780","6386900"," us."
"6387100","6390820"," They're trying to put this, this website together, right?"
"6391920","6394900"," And this group, we're all diverse people."
"6394900","6397340"," And we all have different viewpoints in the world. "
"6397920","6400160"," I'm sure that a lot of ways we disagree with each other."
"6401980","6408140"," And we're creating like an entire generation of people that can't disagree on certain topics and"
"6408140","6411520"," agree on others or at least negotiate or, or, my, my, my daughter."
"6413240","6418140"," They're not teaching her how to, they're not teaching her the finer aspects of writing an essay. "
"6419260","6419780"," And arguments."
"6421460","6425220"," And they're not teaching her enough about philosophy."
"6427260","6433180"," About fables and mythology and the ground work of government. "
"6433880","6434860"," The framework of government."
"6436060","6439520"," And so I'm having to do that myself, supplement that stuff for her."
"6440300","6445280"," And I'm trying to explain to her that if she doesn't learn this stuff. "
"6446280","6451780"," That there are plenty of very sophisticated ways."
"6453000","6455800"," For her to consume."
"6457700","6461400"," Ways of thinking that are not free thinking and. "
"6461760","6468680"," That their package prepackaged for you to assume someone else's ideals and values and."
"6469140","6471500"," Thoughts so you don't have to think for yourself."
"6472140","6475280"," And construct an argument that doesn't piss somebody off. "
"6478710","6480390"," And to fight with people."
"6481230","6483890"," So they're not teaching this to kids right now in my view."
"6484210","6486090"," So I'm like, I'm like, you have to learn this. "
"6487030","6490310"," So that you can be able to meet somebody that you don't agree with."
"6491010","6493590"," And at least agree to disagree or change your opinion."
"6494310","6497250"," Or become enlightened and form your own opinions in life. "
"6497250","6501090"," These kids right now, they're not getting that basic."
"6503230","6507010"," Learning how to construct an argument based upon facts."
"6507990","6511370"," Then try to present their arguments and even counter arguments their arguments. "
"6512150","6515050"," Not piss somebody off in the process and."
"6515930","6518750"," And try to grow as a human as a person."
"6519450","6522250"," And so we're actually doing this right now. "
"6522890","6529490"," Otherwise, you've got very, very, very smart people that would love nothing more than you not to be"
"6529490","6530710"," able to construct an argument."
"6531330","6532270"," Have your own thought process."
"6532830","6535250"," And figure out for yourself what you believe or not believe. "
"6536130","6538070"," And be able to get along in society."
"6539290","6543190"," And so it's fascinating right now to see how this is taught to kids in schools."
"6544150","6547250"," Or not taught to children's schools right now. "
"6547730","6550810"," It's like this, it's like the second or third evolution of becoming a drone."
"6551730","6552530"," In life, right?"
"6552670","6557310"," The less that you think for yourself, the more that you can adopt corporate culture or societal"
"6557310","6557970"," culture."
"6558830","6563150"," And, you know, squirrell yourself away under one flag or another. "
"6564170","6570230"," Rather than have some free thought for your ideals and values are and that kind of stuff and kind"
"6570230","6571690"," of live to that."
"6574900","6575500"," Yeah, man."
"6575640","6576780"," That's what they're doing. "
"6576780","6578060"," Download TikTok, man."
"6578480","6579320"," It's so crazy."
"6579580","6581380"," I'm like, it's so wild. "
"6583360","6586900"," It's very, it's very, you see it in the schooling."
"6587340","6593220"," I'm like, wow, at that age, I had already consumed and was required to understand some of these"
"6593220","6595780"," concepts that they just topically cover."
"6596280","6602160"," And the idea that I'm being told is that they have so much stuff they have to learn today, but"
"6602160","6603180"," they didn't have to learn back then. "
"6603180","6607860"," As long as they have a base understanding of it, they can apply it when they need to."
"6608460","6612000"," But the truth is that these kids aren't learning this stuff."
"6612320","6616380"," They need to know this stuff and to be successful in life. "
"6625570","6626610"," We're in private school."
"6627630","6633430"," We were in private school here in Detroit and we're still in private school now."
"6634190","6638310"," We have a private online school that we stayed with after COVID. "
"6638310","6641530"," So we have like private online teachers, all that kind of stuff."
"6645860","6648360"," Oh, now trade the dollar 13."
"6648980","6651340"," Oh, what happened there, bro?"
"6652040","6652680"," What happened?"
"6653120","6655520"," Oh, oh, oh, oh. "
"6658790","6660910"," Do I think that TikTok is bad?"
"6661210","6662490"," I think it has its place."
"6663810","6664810"," We'll discuss."
"6665090","6666010"," That's a cool topic, actually. "
"6666010","6670110"," You know who had a good conversation about this was?"
"6670830","6673930"," I think it was the guy from Wired magazine."
"6674570","6681070"," It could be wrong, but I think it's the guy the founder of Wired magazine was asked once about the"
"6681070","6684970"," information that you get today."
"6685550","6690890"," So when I was when I was young, now trading dollar 13 on 400 C's. "
"6693940","6696940"," Squeeze and hire here event ball wearing off."
"6698860","6702680"," Now we've got, so we don't have a lot of time here, right?"
"6703260","6706740"," We've got a 2 p.m. Right here."
"6706860","6710820"," This is when the event is the minutes to be released. "
"6712400","6714280"," We got some time running out here."
"6714400","6718820"," I don't like the idea of us being here for so long."
"6719560","6719960"," Right. "
"6720160","6725440"," So there might be a bunch of money up here between now and 2 p.m. We don't have a"
"6725440","6726580"," ton of time here, right?"
"6726760","6727420"," To get up here."
"6728540","6732220"," If we get this rolled out at any point for this event ball, maybe."
"6733320","6736180"," But I'd like to at some point take some profit here. "
"6736360","6737540"," So time's kind of burning, right?"
"6738100","6740340"," Just be aware of that as we head into the event today."
"6742060","6745480"," I think that was the guy from it was either it was one of the guys from one of the"
"6745480","6747060"," online magazines."
"6747060","6751160"," So as a kid, you couldn't trust Wikipedia. "
"6752740","6756660"," And then some time pass and people are like, yeah, you can reference it now as long as you still"
"6756660","6757180"," do research."
"6757900","6760740"," And now people are like, you can use Wikipedia as a good source."
"6760760","6761620"," You can cite it. "
"6762100","6764340"," Believe it or not, that's being taught."
"6766000","6772400"," But this guy from Wired was asked about the information available on the internet and it's not."
"6773540","6778520"," It's rating says the US debt ceiling uncertainty is a risk for treasury money and market funds. "
"6778780","6781040"," And it's also says the US debt ceiling."
"6781260","6786080"," The depth of knowledge on the Internet is not great."
"6787340","6790240"," The depth of knowledge on TikTok is even less. "
"6793700","6800000"," The truth be told for you to get depth of knowledge, you likely need to experience things."
"6800000","6804940"," And you likely need to go to something that's dying, which is a library."
"6806040","6810860"," And seek out texts books, real hard books. "
"6811540","6820340"," This is one of the problems with AI is that it only has access to or at one time it"
"6820340","6825600"," only had access to known works that were published to the Internet."
"6825600","6827860"," When they open up AI to consume."
"6829140","6839080"," When they're opening up AI to"
"6839080","6843560"," consume new information, they're trying to pull this information from humans that actually spend"
"6843560","6844280"," time in libraries. "
"6845260","6851040"," Or have been to war or have sailed the world or have hyped an actual mountain and can give you"
"6851040","6854900"," serendipitous information that you can't get on the Internet."
"6855520","6859660"," And that will help AI to expand."
"6860100","6865980"," Now it doesn't answer still all of the information that's just published in book form. "
"6866540","6869600"," There's some information that AI still doesn't have access to."
"6869960","6874200"," It hasn't been read every book out of a library that hasn't been published to the Internet."
"6874800","6878760"," And there's one other factor in AI that AI can't account for. "
"6879440","6882020"," And that's heading back to serendipity."
"6882020","6890860"," If you were to go to a library or go for a hike or go for a sail, there's randomness"
"6890860","6899700"," that comes into play into how you experience new knowledge or consume knowledge."
"6900040","6903440"," You might go to a library and ask a librarian another dying breed, right?"
"6903980","6905220"," Hey, I'm here to research. "
"6905340","6906760"," I don't know the color blue."
"6907640","6912360"," And you might find that one librarian might show you the books on the color blue."
"6912880","6915120"," And then another librarian might say, hey, you know what?"
"6916860","6923660"," I know you're looking for the color blue, but I had this experience once with a song that I heard"
"6923660","6928740"," where I was able to visualize in my brain the color blue. "
"6929100","6934660"," Maybe you should veer off over here to the left and check out this music section."
"6934660","6942100"," And so that serendipity that takes place when people are doing research, they can go down paths"
"6942100","6943900"," that they didn't expect to."
"6944400","6950880"," That's one of the problems with AI is that it doesn't have that free will, that free thought to"
"6950880","6953420"," find something novel, right?"
"6954560","6961940"," And I think that's one of the problems with TikTok circling back to finding all of your information"
"6961940","6963820"," and your depth of knowledge from the Internet. "
"6964540","6967380"," Or books that are known or scanned into the Internet."
"6967380","6968840"," You can't really get that experience."
"6971420","6976420"," That's serendipity that you need for novel thoughts, ideas, and creation. "
"6993500","6994300"," Give me one second here."
"6994360","6995160"," We've got a phone call coming in."
"7130820","7133520"," All right, so just a brief note here, right?"
"7133940","7139480"," If you're paranoid about a rollover at any point, there's no shame in taking profit. "
"7140280","7141840"," I'm going to call right now."
"7141940","7142500"," So I apologize."
"7142620","7143400"," I got to take this call. "
"7143680","7149440"," But for you, if you're looking for a place to take some profit off above, you know, this isn't a"
"7149440","7150100"," bad place, right?"
"7150200","7151600"," We're at $1.09 right now."
"7152160","7156680"," So I think I'm up 17 cents or something, right?"
"7156940","7158040"," So I'm going to sell here."
"7163110","7165910"," So I'm going to take my profit here personally, right?"
"7166310","7167790"," Now, do I think we're going up here?"
"7167810","7168130"," I do. "
"7168230","7169410"," I think we're going all the way up here."
"7169790","7172090"," We're going to hit 400, possibly even 402."
"7172850","7176870"," But if you're like, you know, risk-averse, you don't want to get torched or anything like that. "
"7177230","7181710"," You have to decide how much risk you're going to put on the market here."
"7182110","7184750"," Mostly I'm only getting out because I'm on a phone call right now."
"7184790","7188610"," I can't manage this trade and be on a phone call. "
"7188870","7193910"," So for you, you have to decide where you think we're going above from here."
"7194170","7199790"," If you want to wait for the events to be over, some people don't like trade non-event days, right?"
"7199790","7202630"," They'll be like, you know what, I'll just wait for all this to play out."
"7203010","7206610"," And then I'll find a buy-in or a sell point below or above. "
"7207390","7211930"," You know, my take on where I think the next short is, if there is a short, it's up here"
"7211930","7213230"," at 402 or even higher."
"7213930","7214870"," 408, possibly."
"7215410","7218790"," And I still haven't gone over in depth in detail. "
"7218790","7223670"," I think that's still valid for bears, but I will at some points this morning."
"7223670","7224530"," Just give me a few minutes."
"7224670","7231390"," I'm going to get off this phone call, and then we'll come back to where I think we're trading the"
"7231390","7233350"," next week, next two weeks, that kind of stuff. "
"7856610","7858910"," You see that reversal candle right here?"
"7859190","7860450"," I want you to see this right here."
"7860570","7861910"," Not a bad place to take profit."
"7862770","7865130"," I don't know what you guys are doing out there. "
"7865730","7869470"," It's $400 season now, $1.26. No shame in taking money here."
"7870650","7871810"," I do want you to know that."
"7872010","7873310"," Watch this one minute here. "
"7873310","7876930"," Sometimes this trigger will come right back down, retest this one minute."
"7877710","7883030"," So, you know, as, you know, level to level, you're trying to take money and then add to your"
"7883030","7883370"," position."
"7883710","7886090"," Don't forget, we've got some vol down below here. "
"7886450","7887650"," Always be snapping lines."
"7888570","7892350"," You're looking for consolidation and not distribution on this trade."
"7893570","7895110"," I'll be right back with you guys in just a minute. "
"8009400","8010460"," All right, so I'm back."
"8010660","8011740"," I apologize for that break."
"8011740","8014600"," I had to take that, take that card note, no choice in this. "
"8015640","8017140"," I apologize to you out there."
"8020670","8027790"," All right, so we're going to talk about, before we get to this event ball here, we're going to talk"
"8027790","8029870"," about where we're headed, why we're headed there."
"8030430","8032630"," We're talking about this this morning, the start of the show. "
"8035270","8041590"," And we're going to, as a matter of fact, this is the same shit that was on Captain's Alpha."
"8041590","8049680"," So, we're going to review a couple of things here that I promised I'd review with you."
"8050280","8056690"," The first one being that we're going to look before we do the market breadth. "
"8057010","8058850"," Well, we'll start with the market breadth indicator maybe."
"8062530","8064010"," Hank tight, just a second here."
"8068010","8070910"," I want to show just the market breadth indicator for you. "
"8073230","8078830"," Let me just a second here."
"8100570","8102190"," Let me just a second here."
"8102730","8104630"," The background, I'm going to do this work for you. "
"8113020","8115840"," And we're down around 21%."
"8116300","8117940"," Okay, so stay with me here."
"8119060","8128810"," Now you see, I want you to, one other thing I want to show you here is, oh, baby. "
"8128810","8132290"," Oh, baby."
"8132850","8134150"," We're getting squeezy."
"8137860","8139940"," Oh, you guys fill it up there?"
"8140220","8141840"," Getting a little squeezy up there. "
"8143140","8146260"," Feel that squeezyness coming up here, right?"
"8147540","8151000"," Oh, baby."
"8152000","8160370"," So, now we've seen some velocity and downward movement movement of price."
"8160370","8160830"," Okay. "
"8164470","8174520"," Now, normally I show you, normally I show you, see if I can do this in the background here, right"
"8174520","8175480"," there."
"8176620","8177340"," Okay, perfect."
"8178900","8180140"," I'm going to show you this in the background. "
"8180460","8184360"," We're going to take a little break here, not break, but we're going to take a little breather here."
"8187090","8188910"," And you can watch this."
"8189330","8190050"," You're in your own. "
"8190050","8190850"," You can watch this."
"8191010","8191530"," Are we going higher?"
"8191870","8192170"," There's a question."
"8192670","8194750"," Probably going to squeeze to the moon right here. "
"8195629","8201370"," Just rip face through this, through this, to this resistance, right?"
"8202629","8206410"," Start squeezing higher here as we head into this event."
"8208129","8213750"," Pure rage, ready to trap all these sellers down here, all these late sellers, right?"
"8213750","8219910"," We're going to talk about, I'm going to switch over real quick so you guys can get a feel for"
"8219910","8220070"," this."
"8223010","8231889"," So, just on breath here, let me see if I can move this over to the side here. "
"8231950","8233389"," I want to show you guys breath here."
"8233990","8238129"," Now, normally you guys see this with the color rainbow colors here."
"8239709","8243950"," We've seen some acceleration on the downside with price in the market. "
"8245549","8246209"," Finally, right?"
"8246450","8251270"," Some acceleration of downside of price, but I do want you to be aware of a couple things here."
"8251530","8257350"," Now, we still, we have some moments, previous moments where we don't go down any further, but"
"8257350","8259350"," oftentimes we have a little bit more room to go."
"8260590","8262650"," And I like to, I love buying down here. "
"8262730","8263950"," It's one of my favorite things to buy."
"8264090","8265690"," It doesn't matter if it's a bull market or bear market."
"8266370","8267590"," I'll buy the shit out of that. "
"8267590","8268549"," I'll buy the shit out of that."
"8268549","8269549"," I'll buy the shit out of that."
"8269610","8270510"," I'll buy the shit out of that. "
"8270530","8271469"," I'll buy the shit out of that."
"8271990","8273930"," I'll buy the shit out of that."
"8273930","8275910"," I'll buy that one right there, right?"
"8277030","8280490"," I'm looking for this last little leg down, right?"
"8281330","8282030"," Right here. "
"8282309","8283330"," I'm looking for that still."
"8283530","8284549"," We still haven't seen it."
"8285209","8285790"," Do we get it?"
"8285990","8286490"," I don't know. "
"8286750","8293870"," But when we're down around 20, 21 percent, we tend to have a capitulation or liquidation moment in"
"8293870","8294250"," the market."
"8295150","8297969"," Once we get below 20 percent, we got 1918."
"8299110","8301129"," We get this last little liquidation event. "
"8301129","8304910"," We can get some really violent moves down here when that happens."
"8305950","8315950"," Price is actually no, no, a price is no object when we're at this last part of the stage"
"8315950","8317070"," of capitulation."
"8317450","8324510"," So have this in your mind that there's still room to run down from right where we are. "
"8326290","8328570"," So leave that on the table at this point."
"8329330","8336570"," It still hasn't met my expectations for a dip buy with an oversold condition down here."
"8336610","8337490"," It still hasn't met it. "
"8337790","8338990"," Okay, so I want you to be aware of this."
"8339850","8342570"," How low can it go is your next question, right?"
"8344309","8349410"," So the question becomes, well cap, how low can it go?"
"8350330","8353110"," Give me a second here and move some of this stuff back so you can see it."
"8354709","8355850"," I'm going to move. "
"8356030","8356670"," Come on now."
"8357389","8358410"," Just a second."
"8381969","8382809"," Second here. "
"8383450","8389850"," The question becomes, how low can it go then cap and why is it not selling off right now, cap?"
"8390910","8392110"," I always big questions."
"8393370","8394750"," Delete this here."
"8397370","8398490"," What am I looking for?"
"8398730","8399310"," How do I delete this?"
"8401430","8408050"," The question becomes, how low can it go?"
"8411290","8413510"," We're going to take a look at that right now. "
"8414790","8415970"," How low can it go?"
"8417070","8418590"," We're actually getting very bullish here, by the way."
"8419130","8419550"," Extremely bullish."
"8420810","8424550"," You may not know that, but we're getting violently move up bullish here. "
"8424550","8426190"," Like face ripper."
"8428310","8429270"," Face ripper."
"8431230","8432410"," Violent move up here. "
"8433250","8435010"," Explosive move up, as a matter of fact."
"8436170","8437130"," Like cranking."
"8437910","8439910"," Wait till you see this move higher here. "
"8440050","8440990"," It's going to be face ripper."
"8442150","8444310"," Now I'm going to show you into this face ripper."
"8445110","8447510"," Before it happens, I want to show you a couple of things here. "
"8447730","8447750"," Okay."
"8448370","8449330"," Get your notepad."
"8452930","8453890"," Face ripper. "
"8455290","8455770"," Squeezing."
"8458090","8460330"," We're actually getting very explosive right here."
"8461590","8464010"," So we're going to start ripping some faces off. "
"8464790","8466290"," There's your PT2 above."
"8468710","8470890"," And I want to talk to you guys about."
"8470970","8471810"," So especially if you're a bear. "
"8471970","8473390"," If you're a bear, get your notepads out."
"8473390","8476050"," Get your piece of paper and depending on all that other fun stuff."
"8477890","8480750"," All that crazy shit you got going on out there. "
"8480830","8482690"," Smartest guys on YouTube right?"
"8482910","8487070"," Yesterday some asshole was offense to you if you're here in this program."
"8487070","8491890"," But you're in my fucking program trying to talk about the fucking smartest people out there."
"8492010","8492950"," I think they're fucking bullshit. "
"8493610","8494130"," I'll be honest."
"8494630","8499090"," Get my ass fucking same goddamn videos every day."
"8500730","8501530"," Market crash. "
"8501710","8502070"," Market crash."
"8502270","8502670"," Market crash."
"8502870","8503270"," Market crash. "
"8504210","8505430"," My ass dude."
"8505970","8506630"," All right."
"8506730","8506950"," Hold on. "
"8508370","8509490"," My ass."
"8510370","8510650"," Okay."
"8510930","8515550"," So it's all I hear nonstop garbage. "
"8516290","8518010"," Nonstop garbage garbage garbage."
"8518490","8520210"," So there's a couple of things here."
"8521030","8523510"," I want you to see if you're in the market crash. "
"8523510","8527070"," Uh, rage."
"8527430","8527630"," Okay."
"8528370","8534690"," So we know on the weekend that you guys pay $60 a month, $300 a month. "
"8535430","8537710"," That's what you pay all day long."
"8538750","8540570"," For garbage data."
"8543740","8544940"," Garbage data. "
"8546740","8551780"," That told you that the market crash was at 400, right?"
"8552660","8555200"," They fed you that garbage dog shit."
"8555760","8556640"," All weekend."
"8558860","8560480"," And I told you no. "
"8561060","8562320"," Said that's not true."
"8564020","8566660"," I said you got to break this shit right here."
"8569220","8569900"," Sorry. "
"8570800","8571900"," You're wrong again."
"8573040","8575320"," And you charge people for that dog shit."
"8576480","8579500"," So you're wrong again right there. "
"8580360","8583100"," Wrong fucking wrong fucking wrong again."
"8585100","8588060"," So now the market breath is telling you we can go down here."
"8588100","8589000"," We have more to go down. "
"8589320","8589460"," Okay."
"8590720","8593660"," Um, and I, I still tend to agree with that."
"8593800","8595740"," We had this beautiful cell here, right?"
"8596680","8600340"," Got underneath the hourly, right?"
"8600520","8601660"," The moment we're underneath the hourly. "
"8601660","8602800"," See the screen line right here."
"8603340","8604840"," We're underneath the hourly."
"8605080","8605900"," It's, it's bearish. "
"8607120","8607320"," Okay."
"8608600","8610660"," Uh, we had a second cell right here, right?"
"8610660","8612220"," Second cell right here."
"8612480","8614300"," One, two, right?"
"8614820","8617280"," Now we're still underneath the hourly here. "
"8618520","8620200"," And here is that green line."
"8620300","8620940"," This is the hourly."
"8621440","8624780"," And believe it or not, this is the daily right here. "
"8625020","8626340"," This is the one day right here."
"8627740","8631840"," Now the moment we crossed underneath the attention out there."
"8632000","8632180"," Okay. "
"8632900","8637220"," The moment we traded underneath this one day here with the hourly here."
"8637220","8638220"," Right?"
"8638420","8643520"," It says that we're going to be bearish for multiple days, like three, four, five days."
"8645240","8649540"," Um, so this is like, ultimately we're still bearish here. "
"8650100","8654620"," Ultimately, bears are just looking for their last leg."
"8655220","8658500"," You remember me yesterday go on trying to buy this down here, not sell it."
"8658640","8661000"," We're trying to sell this above over here. "
"8661660","8663540"," And we're trying to buy this down below."
"8664000","8664460"," Does that make sense?"
"8665200","8668280"," Makes sense to any of you out there in YouTube land."
"8669280","8669700"," Right?"
"8669780","8673500"," We're trying to buy this for this interaction here above. "
"8674200","8681970"," So trying to buy this to watch the interaction here."
"8683390","8685510"," Right for a trade lower."
"8686310","8691030"," So over here, if you're a, if you're a smart trader. "
"8691810","8696150"," Trying to take your money and run and look for this down below here."
"8696150","8698290"," And there's two reasons."
"8698750","8698770"," Okay. "
"8699790","8702350"," Uh, you need, you need, you need downward velocity."
"8703290","8706190"," You've got the, the daily velocity helping out of bear."
"8706390","8708670"," You've got the hourly velocity helping out of bear. "
"8709030","8713450"," You've got the one in the five minute, but then you've got this very emotional weekly and monthly"
"8713450","8714030"," down below."
"8714590","8716970"," And to break through this level, 396."
"8719430","8719990"," Zero. "
"8726300","8730540"," You need the help from the daily and the hourly to get underneath."
"8730540","8734860"," You need price to roll over here as well with it."
"8735380","8737780"," So you need confirmation that you're going to get rejection. "
"8739800","8742780"," Off of the hourly in the daily price rejection."
"8744120","8745840"," Off of the hourly in the daily."
"8746860","8750560"," And then the, then that, even that next last trade down from there. "
"8750700","8752680"," Let's say we, let's say we roll over up here."
"8753420","8757380"," When we come down, you need the hourly to follow you."
"8757380","8761820"," You also need velocity on the downside with the daily. "
"8763420","8767160"," And you have to break through this weekly and monthly down below here."
"8767240","8767340"," Okay."
"8767360","8770340"," So there's another trade in here probably for the bears. "
"8770660","8772500"," And there might be a trade here for the bulls above here."
"8772580","8773140"," Believe it or not."
"8773380","8776120"," We might not actually get that last breath move down. "
"8776840","8777260"," Right."
"8777420","8778740"," So you have to have stops here."
"8778880","8779980"," If you take a short up here. "
"8780840","8782700"," If you're a barrier, you think you're, you're stops."
"8783500","8786500"," The next trade below here for the bears, if they get it."
"8787960","8789900"," Is take the money and run. "
"8790340","8790520"," Right."
"8790880","8794860"," Or a break below three ninety six zero."
"8796800","8801440"," With a price move down to three eighty or something is where your next trade is. "
"8801560","8801660"," Right."
"8801780","8804920"," You can take this trade one more time down below here."
"8807100","8811080"," And then there's a rejection trade underneath it. "
"8815330","8818190"," So if you're actually looking for it, you're like, okay, it's right there."
"8818190","8818950"," It's going to come down here."
"8820710","8822410"," I'm still bearish her cap, right?"
"8823070","8825370"," You need to be able to smash through this stuff. "
"8826430","8829670"," And there's like a third trade second or third trade down here."
"8830170","8833530"," Now, if we just put across this line, it's sorry bears."
"8834230","8836770"," We need the velocity of the hourly, the daily. "
"8837070","8842870"," Now, as we cross each one of these lines, if we cross this yellow line, this is two to three"
"8842870","8843150"," weeks."
"8844390","8846710"," Of down and sideways and down, believe it or not."
"8846850","8850450"," If you break the blue line, this could turn into months down. "
"8851290","8851410"," Okay."
"8851790","8855690"," And that would mean that we're not able to get a put back above three ninety four."
"8856070","8857630"," Three ninety six, whatever it is. "
"8858270","8861670"," So until that happens, I don't want to fucking hear it."
"8861770","8862390"," I'll be honest with you."
"8862430","8863510"," I don't want to fucking hear it from bears. "
"8866650","8869370"," You know, the next trade for bears is above."
"8869690","8872030"," It's probably not exactly at four or two."
"8872030","8874790"," But you've got four or two here to be paying attention to. "
"8875190","8878930"," You've got four zero four three six to be paying attention to."
"8879150","8883030"," There's actually a failure over three or four days."
"8883810","8884990"," You can see up here. "
"8885450","8888250"," We grind around, but we can't get a new high."
"8889150","8889270"," Right."
"8889350","8894050"," If we don't get a new high here, we could roll it back over and start selling it down, right?"
"8894710","8897050"," Gives time for the daily and the hourly get over. "
"8897170","8898510"," We start blasting through here."
"8900350","8903530"," But, you know, looks like that fucking crash."
"8903790","8904670"," It hasn't played out yet. "
"8904850","8905050"," Has it?"
"8905510","8907370"," We know for shit, sir, it's not four hundred."
"8908610","8910310"," Because that would have already happened, right?"
"8911910","8915210"," Or is this going to be the videos for the next week for bears?"
"8916090","8918090"," Just no more nonsense until it happens."
"8918730","8923130"," So that the clock is right once a fucking month or two months or three months. "
"8924810","8927390"," So if you're looking for positioning as a bear."
"8932150","8936490"," If you're looking for positioning as a bear, you've got some key places to look."
"8936790","8938650"," Four zero two twenty two, probably slightly under it. "
"8940790","8942910"," Four zero two four four twenty one."
"8943130","8944490"," And I'm on the bear's case on this."
"8944950","8946210"," I'm like one with the bears on this. "
"8946610","8948030"," So far, we're still bearish."
"8949010","8949090"," Right."
"8949230","8951610"," We broke underneath the hourly, broke underneath the daily. "
"8951830","8952490"," I'm bearish here."
"8953630","8955730"," But I'm not short until we get up here."
"8956590","8959970"," I'm not short until we see what this is. "
"8960890","8962630"," If you're a bear, you reshort here."
"8964770","8966210"," I'll just do SH, I guess."
"8967070","8968010"," Or shit, right?"
"8968170","8969270"," We'll do reshit here. "
"8971890","8974730"," Maybe add to your, your, your shitting over here."
"8977630","8979670"," And then you have your stops above here somewhere."
"8980410","8980550"," Okay. "
"8980950","8983610"," So that's where you're, that's where you're like bearish reset is."
"8983810","8984290"," Or you're bearish."
"8984410","8985390"," You're like, you're, you're bearish. "
"8985590","8988730"," Like I'm going to take, I'm going to try to sell this market down and get one more time."
"8988990","8990090"," So it's somewhere up here."
"8990090","8992450"," It sure as shit ain't down here, is it?"
"8995090","8999210"," So if you're looking for this above here, that's where you are now. "
"8999390","9000470"," You're looking for that over there."
"9000550","9000930"," It makes sense."
"9001330","9002110"," You're looking for this. "
"9002790","9005790"," You start to reposition yourself above here."
"9006310","9011190"," You want to see price get rejected and we break through down below."
"9011570","9013810"," Now when we break down below, this is the last part. "
"9014370","9016530"," Get your pens and papers out if you're a bear, okay?"
"9017770","9018790"," It depends on papers out."
"9018790","9022250"," If you're looking for the market crash, I'm going to show you exactly what it looks like."
"9022790","9026450"," So if we get the market crash, I'm going to show you the exact what it looks like. "
"9026710","9026770"," Okay."
"9028430","9029850"," And we're going to revisit this."
"9030270","9035130"," So if you, it will not revisit, but if we do, if we do revisit this, I'm going to show"
"9035130","9036070"," you exactly what it looks like. "
"9036130","9037410"," You're going to take a screenshot here."
"9038870","9042490"," And you're going to, you're going to take your own little screenshot here and you're going to,"
"9042490","9043490"," you're going to remember this."
"9043630","9043830"," Okay. "
"9045570","9046490"," See that blue line?"
"9046610","9047970"," See that yellow line right there?"

"9498150","9503290"," to trade down below we need hourly and daily velocity to break through weekly and monthly velocity"

"9748780","9756320"," down here right it's gonna take time for the bears for this hourly and daily velocity to come back"
"9756320","9763360"," down right and to start trading off it to lower lows so we'll keep our eyes on that if that"
"9763360","9772440"," happens uh you'll get your answer you'll get your confirmation hay cap we traded underneath 396"

"11035620","11043140"," they print we come back down but we swing high and then swing low then i'll close the put side"
"11043140","11049270"," out and i get both ends of the trade to me that's one of the benefits of a strangle is"
"11049270","11053930"," that you get a free trade even if you have one one side went and printed both you like what"
"11053930","11058990"," you paid and some profit you take the money and run you you likely have a free trade that's how"
"11058990","11065410"," you deconstruct spreads too right you take the money off one side of the spread pocket that cash"

"14206190","14209630"," question so what level would those four C's to get back in our fee to admit that you're wrong"
"14209630","14216410"," dollar fifty dollar sixty just trying to measure the goal posts yeah so on um so i so what happens"
"14216410","14221650"," here is this is that this is a bottom here right so i've got so my thesis here is that"
"14221650","14226690"," we're not going to break this uh it doesn't matter if i'm buying it right here for us to go"
"14226690","14230670"," up doesn't matter if i'm buying it right here this is why i'm not on zero dates too right so"
"14230670","14236950"," you guys noticed that i didn't buy zero dates i said i'm buying calls for tomorrow um right i"
"14236950","14242150"," didn't say hey i'm buying zero dates right here i said i'm buying calls for tomorrow right i know"
"14242150","14247990"," that this is bottom i know that we didn't have uh bad news so for me to say yeah i'm"
"14247990","14254270"," wrong in my thesis here i need to see the market as i said earlier trade below and hold right"
"14254270","14264350"," here right so until this happens here my thesis is that we go up right does that make sense uh"
"14264350","14270470"," i'm sweating of course but my thesis is that we go up from here there wasn't anything material in"
"14270470","14277190"," my view uh that we should be going down so this is the bottom for me right here right if"
"14277190","14286950"," i'm looking at this briefly okay and you're trying to tell me on a five minute or a"
"14286950","14291910"," ten minute or even a fifteen minute uh that we're going to crash right here right you need"
"14291910","14298650"," something material i need you to be looking at it on a larger time frame here right this is not"
"14298650","14305170"," a one minute chart okay this is the 23rd of February or 14th excuse me this is the 14th of"
"14305170","14312930"," February here uh this is the 15th of February here uh and so when we sell on these triggers down"
"14312930","14317830"," here we get back up here we sell this trigger right here right we come back up here and sell"
"14317830","14324790"," down right we've sold it now once twice or one three times one two and three and bears are looking"
"14324790","14331370"," for news right some some reason some material reason to sell this market so if they can't sell this"
"14331370","14338050"," market i'm a buyer here and this should be a violent move up uh this should be a violent move"
"14338050","14344730"," up right away or today or tomorrow we should get a violent move higher uh so if i'm buying a"
"14344730","14350710"," day out calls or even next week calls which i haven't done yet uh i've just got the one dates"
"14350710","14356650"," trying to get up into tomorrow here so don't get torched on zero dates for the event ball right so"
"14356650","14362430"," for me here it's just a matter of time the longer i sit here the more likelihood is that we"
"14362430","14368390"," go higher right you need something fundamental down here uh to be selling this market now if i'm"
"14368390","14373930"," upside down so i lost a big two two big trades yesterday back here i've made some money today but"
"14373930","14378530"," not what i should be making uh so if i lose this trade here if you're like hey cap what"
"14378530","14384470"," if you lose this trade what happens right or when are you wrong in your analysis i would pick up"
"14384470","14389350"," that short trade underneath here to try to gain my money back right so we get underneath this and"
"14389350","14394710"," we start trading down i would take the short side of this trade but for right now where this bottom"
"14394710","14399310"," is i'm trying to get this trade higher now do i think it's going to happen in the day today"
"14399310","14405090"," i have no idea is it going to happen tomorrow into the open i have no idea but unless there's"
"14405090","14410990"," some fundamental change this is our local bottom right here it's almost to a pin strike it's like a"
"14410990","14417110"," five minute a five minute here whether i'm buying it right here or whether i'm buying it right here"
"14417770","14425390"," to make this trade higher or even right here to take this trade higher my thesis is surrounded by"
"14425390","14431370"," this whole area and it doesn't my thesis doesn't actually disprove itself unless we trade under"
"14431370","14437710"," here and begin to trade lower that's where my thesis is wrong to pick up calls for a higher number"
"14437710","14444610"," does that make sense so that's why i feel comfortable here sitting here right and so unless we see"
"14444610","14450350"," this down below it's all a matter of time to go higher or or there's something fundamental in the"
"14450350","14454490"," market if there was like news that came out it was like hey we have to sell the market here"
"14454490","14459350"," for a good reason uh then for me the short is on on a much higher number it's way up"
"14459350","14467190"," here not way but it's up here somewhere at minimum the short is up here to me this is where"
"14467190","14473350"," you begin your short above here at minimum if not 408 after two or three days so even into friday"
"14473350","14481350"," i'm not looking to short the market unless we get underneath and hold underneath 395 and change um"
"14481350","14488330"," my short is above right so i'm embarrassed with you i'm just not bearish here right i've got no no"
"14488330","14495530"," bearish um no bearish uh take care for no bearish trade that i can see the only thing that i"
"14495530","14500010"," see here so let's say i bought puts here right let's say i bought puts right here let's say i"
"14500010","14506450"," bought puts say i bought puts here instead i was long puts here right so let's say i'm long puts"
"14506450","14510730"," here the risk is all against me that we're going to rip higher at any point we could have ripped"
"14510730","14516410"," higher there we could rip higher here rip higher here rip higher at any point i'm just begging uh"
"14516410","14523670"," to get torched i mean like zero my trade going to zero so until that happens uh the probability is"
"14523670","14529370"," on my side that we go up here right so if i have to trade probabilities i'm trading the probability"
"14529370","14535730"," that that we are going up here we're going to squeeze violently at some point higher does that make"
"14535730","14541470"," sense so that's my that's my take on the market right here and when you say things to me like"
"14541470","14547830"," when you say things to me like whoa we might crash through here there's no support here i'm like eh"
"14547830","14553270"," i've got the actual data on me saying that uh you've got tons of buyers here and that's why we're"
"14553270","14558910"," not crashing through right now for the volume of sellers right now you've got you got buyers coming"
"14558910","14566690"," up to actually match these market sellers you're seeing rotation in real time you will see the"
"14566690","14572790"," buyers overcome the sellers and we will squeeze higher you can actually see it in the function of"
"14572790","14582660"," the market at this moment this will become smart money right this will become the smart"
"14582660","14602050"," money and then your dumb money will chase this is the point i'm trying to make trust me"
"14602050","14607730"," it's very dangerous to be short right here it's very dangerous to be holding puts right here"
"14607730","14612690"," because at any moment this could just start squeezing like just blasting and yeah i know that you"
"14612690","14618570"," say you'll be saying out there you'll say to yourself like yeah i'll close in time though uh but"
"14618570","14625250"," i've been in that trade i've lost my ass on those trades repetitively um we know where this where"
"14625250","14631310"," the short was we know where the bottom is uh we know that people are saying if we get below"
"14631310","14637010"," a table of 400 that we're going to market crash it hasn't happened yet if you want to market crash"
"14637010","14642990"," the only thing that i can tell you is that you need velocity to come down on these two numbers"
"14642990","14649710"," here get underneath with price and then you can start talking about a big short but until that"
"14649710","14657350"," happens the thesis is that we're buying every dip down here and i'd sell it a rip above too you"
"14657350","14664470"," know so that that's it for me i have nothing else to say to say about the topic here um"
"14664470","14678230"," this is where i make lots of money so traditionally i make a ton of money here and you"
"14678230","14683450"," know the funniest part about this too is right i won't be long let's let's say we trade the 408"
"14683450","14690090"," i won't be long there calls you won't see me taking calls if we trade that high you won't see"
"14690090","14694230"," me in the market you'll be you'll be seeing me trying to buy a put uh to start the market"
"14694230","14704130"," down again i'll only be long from here to like 404 that's it and i'm done uh you guys see"
"14704130","14709210"," this all the time you guys have seen this from me many many many times people will say why don't"
"14709210","14712810"," you continue to be long here and i'm like i was buying a bottom down there i was trying to"
"14712810","14720550"," get most of the money in safety and to me this is safe i find this safe i find buying"
"14720550","14729440"," right here very safe or even up here i find this very safe to me i find the odds are"
"14729440","14742330"," in my favor more times than they're against me here for a significant gain no i"
"14742330","14748290"," never let the market breathe well i shouldn't say that there are some rules to let that rule so i"
"14748290","14753590"," i will if i hold anything overnight it's a directional trade for me like a zero date or a one"
"14753590","14757470"," date shouldn't be a zero date but a one date the day before so if i'm buying call like today"
"14757470","14765410"," i'm buying calls for tomorrow uh to hold overnight right i will sell those calls or puts at the"
"14765410","14771330"," bell sometimes i'll let them breathe for like 10 seconds 15 seconds i watch the price of the"
"14771330","14775530"," closing price of the up of the uh zero date well it's what's a one date it's becoming a zero"
"14775530","14783090"," date and then what so like the price that we close on at 415 i wait for the open and"
"14783090","14789790"," if that price adjusts to at least catch the ball right catch the ball and then i close immediately"
"14789790","14799450"," this is like a process that usually takes uh zero seconds to 15 40 seconds something like that now"
"14799450","14805710"," even if it continues in my direction that i once wanted you'll never see me come on youtube or fin"
"14805710","14811090"," twitch and say oh i was still short or oh i was still long calls there man i made all"
"14811090","14817690"," this money you guys have never heard me say that i close always at that at that open there are"
"14817690","14824290"," some times that i've held those times that i've held i've been upside down in that uh trade so"
"14824290","14830170"," let's say i hold overnight zero let's say right now let's say right now let's make do an example so"
"14830170","14836090"," let's say let's say right now for tomorrow right let's look at tomorrow quick so let's say for"
"14836090","14843530"," tomorrow so i've got 400 seeds for tomorrow right if we open down here tomorrow i will hold onto"
"14843530","14849310"," these calls down here being upside down because i'm already burning right i'm upside down in my"
"14849310","14854990"," trade there's no reason for me i'll just let these things burn down here because if we snap back up"
"14854990","14860070"," i can at least make some money in the snap and the snap higher does that make sense now if"
"14860070","14866190"," we're if i'm winning that trade let's say we open up here at 400 tomorrow and i'm up on this"
"14866190","14872250"," trade and you're in here trying to buy calls for a higher trade i'm actually selling to you to make"
"14872250","14879110"," take my money and run always now if we're down here tomorrow on open i will hold these doesn't make"
"14879110","14884890"," sense so if i'm upside down in an overnight trade i will hold but if i'm if i'm making money"
"14884890","14889410"," on that open i take my gains and go now i was just talking to my wife about this of"
"14889410","14897190"," all people she was asking me why i sell on the open and the reason i sell on the open"
"14897190","14903410"," is because it's a completely new trade to me and a completely new set of risks so let's say i"
"14903410","14909110"," calculate my risk into tomorrow i'm like okay so i'm going to put some risk on that we're going to"
"14909110","14916550"," trade higher into tomorrow right now right so i have to calculate my risk to reward so do i think"
"14916550","14921830"," we're going to crash overnight here i don't i think we're going higher here that's this so this is"
"14921830","14928750"," my thesis right now we're going higher right this is my thesis that we're going higher into"
"14928750","14934130"," tomorrow right let's say we go higher right so let's say we trade up here into tomorrow and we get"
"14934130","14943870"," into tomorrow hold on here hold on here let's say we trade up into here tomorrow"
"14943870","14950210"," right and we open on the high i have to make another bet here even if i stay long I"
"14950210","14955690"," have to make a brand new bet with brand new risk and say okay So now do I hold my"
"14955690","14956330"," positioning here?"
"14956430","14960390"," Do we slap down and re reprice those options to go higher?"
"14960850","14964350"," So new risk right different risk over here than this risk right here."
"14964630","14969070"," I've got risk here risk here So I have to I have to decide do I want to take on"
"14969070","14969270"," the risk?"
"14969450","14970610"," We start green barring it up."
"14970790","14975790"," Do we straight bloodbath it down if I take my money and run right here, right?"
"14975790","14983050"," I can then wait for the open let the market breathe Right and then reassign risk to move either"
"14983050","14987270"," higher or lower So I lose this profit here, but I gained here, right?"
"14988090","14993070"," And then if we if we if let's say I'm like, oh, I'm still bullish here I'm gonna look for"
"14993070","14996250"," a buy-in down below to re-enter that trade a second time. "
"14996330","14996850"," Does that make sense?"
"14997470","15001170"," So I would have won If we green-barred it up, but I didn't time it properly."
"15001650","15007010"," I could have lost all my money come back down here And and have just re-enter does that make"
"15007010","15007290"," sense?"

"15269280","15280310"," I've only got love for for triggers at this point It's"
"15280310","15281250"," kind of fascinating too."
"15281390","15288950"," We're sitting here and you heard 400, but we're just grind-setting down here at 397, 396 so that's"
"15288950","15291790"," like another thing that's people are talking about they're like 400 400. "
"15292150","15301670"," I'm like it's not 400 It's not 400 396, 397 it's right in there You know so people are like"
"15301670","15318600"," you get these weird like I don't know Yes,"
"15318920","15331890"," you know what the triggers are Yeah, I"
"15331890","15337430"," don't follow that trend line The only trend that I know of right now is here."
"15337550","15342290"," I'll bring this up in the background the only trend that I know of right now Let me see if"
"15342290","15352480"," I can put this in the back me a second So"
"15352480","15356520"," the the ones that you want to know about so the one that well the one that you should care"
"15356520","15374090"," about is This one right here And"
"15374090","15376010"," I'm gonna show you why you should care here, right?"
"15377990","15380550"," You can see we trade this orange line right here."
"15380610","15383190"," We trade this yellow line right here right pretty consistent, right?"
"15383950","15390210"," It's this big blue line down here big one right here big old blue line That's an important one"
"15390210","15390690"," right there. "
"15391010","15391930"," It's very important, right?"
"15392030","15392390"," It's been respect."
"15392610","15399770"," There's actually a line lower But there's a very important line right here and so You're sitting on"
"15399770","15406490"," it right now is my point you get what's called a reaction on it the matter of fact as time"
"15406490","15412510"," has passed Whenever we've been thrown underneath it we've come right back up above it, right?"
"15412830","15417030"," Throw it underneath it come right back above it throw underneath it come right back above it It's"
"15417030","15423070"," very important right very critical line here and we're sitting on it right now So you know when"
"15423070","15427710"," you're when you're looking at it here You want to see the last time we broke it how long it"
"15427710","15435910"," took to break it one two three four four times Right it's very critical line right here, right?"
"15436210","15441310"," You can see this orange one the blue one and the yellow one How how hard it was to break"
"15441310","15441770"," through it?"
"15441850","15447530"," It's not easy To break through you can see it right down here slam down right train it though back"
"15447530","15453490"," up to see how he pushed up here This red candle was actually green at one point and pushed up"
"15453490","15460470"," off of that line so we're sitting on that line right now and Your point is you're gonna hit this"
"15460470","15465890"," the first time and go through it and my point to you is No, you're not a point is that"
"15465890","15471150"," you're gonna scream higher off it and you're gonna have to pound on it to get underneath it That"
"15471150","15476970"," makes sense and so that's my thesis here is that you're gonna come back up and need to find more"
"15476970","15480370"," sellers You need a reason to break below here."
"15480670","15486790"," So until that happens I'm long here right you guys see that at least I mean I don't know if"
"15486790","15492890"," this makes sense to you This is where the cell where it was down here Right so now you're telling"
"15492890","15498490"," me this is the sound I'm telling you fuck you unless we get underneath right here This is the new"
"15498490","15499210"," cell down below. "
"15499370","15502970"," It's your second leg and you don't take that till right here Makes sense."
"15502990","15510770"," This is where you take the short But this this level right here is hard to break You're gonna need"
"15510770","15518920"," a lot of work and You know to that point to let me show you this to this to chase"
"15518920","15532140"," this point, I guess Let me just give you a face this point real quick To"
"15532140","15544260"," make a mistake and help this out to help this up for you Maybe this clarifies better for you So"
"15544260","15550960"," you can see right see this top right here, this is 49 479 right we traded under sold off this"
"15550960","15559980"," sold off this right Sold off this right here right we sold we lost you see we lost momentum Right"
"15559980","15566120"," so that last kick-ass momentum pushed down below here Right we lost momentum right here in this"
"15566120","15572660"," trade right so we're now being told no we're going down I'm for this trade down lower My point to"
"15572660","15574500"," you is that you're not gonna get it today."
"15575200","15580780"," I Know that you wanted it today But I don't think you're getting it today So until you get it"
"15580780","15585700"," so you didn't get the news that you wanted today So because you're not getting the news that you"
"15585700","15591740"," want today, we're likely gonna have to look for more sellers To need to find more sellers So my"
"15591740","15598220"," point to here is that next one two days you'll have a failure to make a new high above here"
"15598220","15607380"," 403 404 these sellers will help you out That makes sense you need these sellers above here To help"
"15607380","15612780"," you out there's another line that I that I've muted so you couldn't see it But there's a daily this"
"15612780","15618660"," is the daily help that you're gonna get right here, and you're also gonna get a An hourly help"
"15618660","15623520"," that's gonna come down here and actually give you the push that you need to break through So do I"
"15623520","15623960"," think you're breakthrough?"
"15624280","15625700"," Yeah, do I think you're breaking through today?"
"15625960","15632160"," I don't think so I think it has to trade sideways and up for a few days So that that"
"15632160","15639760"," help can come help you as a bear That's I'm not with you on this trade here lower In any"
"15639760","15652740"," way shape or form I Think it's just I think it's just the momentum you need more sellers And"
"15652740","15658560"," if you do let's say you get the let's see you get You know, it's even less bearish is if"
"15658560","15666260"," you get the selling into the overnight hold on here What's even less bearish is if you see futures"
"15666260","15673160"," sell down here, so let's say this right here So let's say you get future. "
"15673420","15678280"," Let's say the let's say the idea is ham a hedge fund I'm on the sell side here and I"
"15678280","15685960"," want to get underneath this 396 Let me make sure you make this blue So say your sell side you're"
"15685960","15693260"," like okay, so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna try to sell Into tomorrow try to get this"
"15693260","15701680"," underneath To get some new lows down below This is even less bearish than you think this is"
"15701680","15711320"," actually We'll signal an end to Instead of seeing like 3200 you'll likely see maybe 38 at the worst"
"15712020","15718480"," So anything like this is not healthy for a bear You don't you want to see like you want it"
"15718480","15725640"," to see in the news today a plunge below Right and firm rejection to get price velocity to the"
"15725640","15731500"," downside When you're not getting that when you're not getting that price velocity the downside it"
"15731500","15738000"," signals a bottom does it make sense So I think that's the only point that I'm trying to make So"
"15738000","15743900"," any of this noise down here I want nothing to do with it When nothing to do with this noise"
"15743900","15753800"," on the short side I only want the long trade here I"
"15753800","15754600"," know this is scary."
"15755640","15765550"," I Get what you're saying and what you're throwing down here I want nothing to do with it Now"
"15765550","15772270"," I would have taken the short trade here if we had some Some news in that FOMC that put us"
"15772270","15778190"," under 396 like if you're like we blasted through it You've got the will of selling in the market."
"15778210","15784410"," You've got banks trying to sell Then I get it 100% I get it until then I don't fucking"
"15784410","15795990"," believe these sellers here I Don't believe them at all Yeah, you"
"15795990","15802630"," know what it is right you get the what happens is So like we're talking about like what's more"
"15802630","15807870"," bearish and what's more what's what like what's super bearish and what's bear What's like the end"
"15807870","15814030"," of bearish right what a bottoms coming in momentum right price momentum price velocity to the"
"15814030","15820030"," downside is Very bad right if you're a bull and you see like like today as a bull if you"
"15820030","15827830"," saw us blast below 395 We blasted through there and came swinging high and then rejected off of 395"
"15827830","15829370"," I'd be like shit. "
"15829630","15837750"," We're we're gonna crash Like this is bad If you see like if you see like a scam In like"
"15837750","15844090"," futures like they're trying to sneak it down Like let's try to close it below 395 and hopefully we"
"15844090","15849950"," can pray that we can close our shorts Tomorrow or something that's not that bearish that means"
"15849950","15857390"," there's a bottom Right, it's trying to manipulate the market try to get underneath and try to try"
"15857390","15863830"," to create some kind of Fair-induced selling but otherwise this is not as bearish as you seem to"
"15863830","15870270"," think it is If you if I was a bear I would want to see with conviction a blast below"
"15870270","15873130"," 395 And I'd be like fuck yeah, man."
"15873310","15878630"," We're super bearish cap can get you to bag of dicks and get out of here You know if because"
"15878630","15882490"," I used to be a bear man like a long time ago was a bear I kind of tell when"
"15882490","15887570"," we're really bearish You kind of tell when we're really bearish right now, we're not that bearish"
"15891970","15893490"," Like how bearish are we here?"
"15895070","15898030"," You really want to see I'm telling you really want to see like "
