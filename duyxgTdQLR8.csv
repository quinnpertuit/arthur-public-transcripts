"210","670"," Five minutes late."
"2150","4090"," Oh, shoot."
"4230","5570"," I was supposed to reset the internet stage. "
"7310","10990"," Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Bla blah blah bla, I'm"
"10990","12750"," like beagueye from uh San Diego."
"15370","22610"," And FU San Diego blah blah blah blah blah blah spla blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah."
"23270","23990"," Mike check. "
"24590","25130"," Mike check."
"26150","28050"," Let's see if that camera works better."
"29190","29430"," Ish. "
"30050","36770"," 1, 2, Mike check."
"38490","39910"," Can you guys hear that, Mike, okay?"
"40610","41650"," You can hear that, okay?"
"42890","43950"," Mike, 1, 2."
"45150","46090"," Good morning everybody."
"46330","47010"," I'll do it out there. "
"48230","51630"," You get a bunch of stuff coming up on here in the next week."
"51630","53350"," It's going to be pretty cool."
"56530","61430"," We're launching segments of the show of the first coming into February. "
"64890","70490"," We're going to switch over to, we've got, I'll ask you for some of your input on this."
"70710","74950"," If I go this morning, we have some changes coming soon."
"75570","77010"," We'll ask you, we'll ask you, hear the audience. "
"78230","79510"," And we're going to ask you."
"82410","88670"," What year, what your thoughts are on some changes that we're making before we make them."
"89710","91770"," As we do on your input. "
"93770","96010"," Can you see me more clearly this morning?"
"96250","97130"," That makes it changes."
"101510","106700"," I'm trying to brighten up the camera."
"107040","107760"," I heard that. "
"108060","111440"," You guys can't barely see me, so I was changing the ISO this morning."
"111440","115020"," And we're going to get right into it right now."
"115680","117240"," You should be able to see me a little bit more clearly. "
"118940","120760"," Let me know if the camera is brighter."
"126000","126960"," Buzzcutt, do we should do that?"
"127100","127979"," I would totally do that."
"128240","129880"," Let's talk about the Buzzcutt. "
"130820","131780"," I would cut my hair."
"132960","134340"," We should chat about that at some point."
"134500","137280"," I made the camera view a little bit tighter as well. "
"137880","138960"," I could probably make it smaller."
"139820","141140"," It's probably a little bit too big."
"141960","144640"," See if I can go over there and change this at least. "
"147380","151060"," I made the screen for book maps slightly smaller."
"151340","155820"," You really just need the, you need to know where this, where major support and resistances."
"156440","157840"," Made this a little bit smaller. "
"158180","162220"," Every six months or every six months of a year around here we switch things up."
"163160","168040"," Chaz comes on and often gives pointers saying we like this."
"168040","170340"," We don't like that or focus. "
"170700","175060"," There's a time when I was focusing on myself that I didn't focus on myself."
"175060","178220"," Like I made my picture smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller."
"178720","182940"," Then Chaz was like, you know, we're, they hear it. "
"183020","186400"," They hear to listen to you talk all day long and blab about all kinds of stupid shit."
"186960","189200"," And they want to see your face every once in a while."
"189560","196400"," So we, then we move the camera over here and then Bork is now saying like Bork made a suggestion"
"196400","203740"," to make the chart down below instead of two or three charts, make it one chart that rotates between"
"203740","204420"," other charts. "
"205220","209360"," So I don't know if you noticed that, but yesterday I think or the day before we switched to a"
"209360","212640"," rotating single chart on the bottom screener."
"213840","216460"," So we're going to make some, we're going to shift some stuff around."
"216460","221060"," You'll end up seeing the down on the right hand side of the screen. "
"223920","233920"," Down below your screen, the"
"233920","237340"," box that's down here, this box right here, that box down there."
"238040","243180"," We're going to switch up with that state with what that says down there coming into the first of"
"243180","243700"," February."
"244480","246540"," That stuff down there is all going to change. "
"247200","253960"," And I think I'm going to change your comments that are shown on it."
"254080","255220"," Some people watch us on a TV."
"256100","261660"," Some TV, some smart TVs have a chat box on the right hand side, some do not. "
"262520","269520"," So I post the chat here because some people don't get to see the chat, depending on how they're"
"269520","269880"," watching."
"270660","276100"," Six million to change, but I'm going to change the chat to it's going to be more like bubbles that"
"276100","277200"," pop up and then disappear."
"277580","283620"," I think like it shows just like one bubble with a comment for like two or three seconds so that"
"283620","284900"," you can read it and that goes away. "
"285240","285700"," I don't know."
"285860","286880"," We're going to check that out too."
"289500","293140"," I got a couple of technical things we got to do here as the stream starts here too. "
"293140","297660"," So give me just two seconds and then I've got them and I'm going to get to."
"298120","300080"," I have a big question for you."
"301180","303160"," So we'll ask that question this morning. "
"304420","305740"," Give me just a couple seconds here."
"307980","309180"," Sort by newest."
"312100","319140"," We have big changes coming like major changes coming and I don't want it to be too freaky. "
"319140","325920"," I don't want it to be like jarring."
"326620","328120"," So maybe we introduced them slowly."
"328500","328980"," I don't know. "
"330020","331180"," We have a lot of chance."
"331360","331800"," We've been running."
"332020","335780"," You guys may have noticed this and some of you probably have noticed and some of you probably have"
"335780","336000"," not. "
"336380","338760"," We've tested different segments."
"339840","344120"," Well, the past year and more recently I've been running different segments."
"344780","350040"," And so we're going to talk about that this morning too because they could be jarring. "
"352700","356320"," As they roll out with the website and all of this stuff."
"357180","359040"," Let me see if I got that right right there."
"360020","361860"," Let me one quick second here. "
"362960","365220"," Here we'll switch to talking directly to viewers."
"366980","369160"," So I think that this is a little bit clearer."
"369460","371580"," I think you can see the studio a little bit better. "
"373300","374700"," I hope that you can."
"376160","381180"," Anyways, I'm switching back right now and I still have some levels to put in."
"381400","383020"," Today we're going to focus on Visa. "
"385400","386900"," Intel on the bottom screen."
"387100","389040"," You're going to see SPX gamma."
"390240","394440"," You're going to see Q's, QQQ's tech. "
"395600","399420"," And then the two reports, the two major reports for the day will flash on the screen."
"400320","401760"," All day long for you."
"402380","404900"," Now both INTC and Visa. "
"407700","411400"," INTC and Visa are just a highlight here."
"412000","414120"," We've been on this discussion."
"415540","417280"," Since earlier in the week. "
"418280","421260"," And I actually started two weeks ago."
"421820","423340"," CTA or maybe even further."
"423720","426980"," We were highlighting CTA's being long the market right. "
"426980","431180"," Then CTA's were fully on board the market."
"432060","435080"," Then we know where the CTA's are sellers."
"436060","437240"," We've highlighted that. "
"437760","439980"," And then we came into earnings season."
"441320","446440"," And you can fairly easily see where CTA's are long."
"447920","452700"," Netflix, you could see the run up into their earnings, right?"
"452700","457380"," And they were looking for any excuse to monetize. "
"457520","459400"," So you saw a nice big push up higher."
"460340","462500"," Well, they monetize, took their money."
"462800","467660"," So they're still on the market, but they're monetizing as earnings season takes place, right?"
"468700","474440"," Now you also saw yesterday they were short or not long Tesla. "
"475100","477260"," And we saw Tesla go to the depths of hell, right?"
"478040","481040"," So they're monetizing that at the same time too, right?"
"481040","487480"," And IBM, they ran IBM up into their earnings and they're long the market."
"487700","488180"," We know this."
"489320","492400"," And they're taking the money and monetizing IBM. "
"492980","499280"," Now, today at the end of the day, we have INTC and Visa reporting."
"500180","504820"," And if any of you are tracking those two stocks, they've been ramping those up into their earnings."
"506180","508640"," Now, this doesn't mean it's going to happen. "
"508640","518580"," But if they fucking fart, if Visa or INTC says anything, not"
"518580","524380"," bullish, just neutral, they'll likely get monetized to the upside."
"525580","527640"," It could be a mixed bag."
"528140","529280"," They'll monetize to the upside. "
"530600","534980"," So all they got to do is come in with a reasonable earnings."
"536160","541820"," And they could miss by a point one or point two or something and have a decent guidance."
"541860","543220"," Not just not terrible guidance. "
"543680","548580"," And they'll likely monetize both of those tickers after the close today."
"549520","553560"," Now we do have something to look at on spoos specifically."
"555300","557200"," We're going to talk about that as well. "
"557500","564360"," We have setting up right now this previous high from yesterday, right?"
"564360","564840"," Right up here."
"565200","571640"," So I'm just watching this closely today to see if we can catch a new high or if we fail"
"571640","574520"," the new high and begin to roll down slightly."
"574520","577600"," But otherwise, this is what I'm watching. "
"577720","583060"," This is what I'm looking for this morning on spoos is can it get above and begin to establish some"
"583060","584300"," form of a base here."
"584640","588460"," We'll look at the gamma profile at some point to this morning and talk about that."
"589400","593700"," Where we are and where we're headed into the month today. "
"593860","594740"," They're going to monetize today."
"595080","597420"," Likely right Thursday is normally monetization day."
"598580","603120"," And then they begin to take profit into Friday for the week. "
"603900","605420"," So we'll chat about that as well."
"606840","612580"," It would not shock me to see some kind of pin today and then a roll down into Friday to"
"612580","617580"," monetize the week as we had a great week for an outstanding week."
"617580","620560"," And we'll take a look at the seasonality calendar today as well. "
"620560","622160"," Matter of fact, they're going to put down the list."
"622680","624620"," The next thing we're going to talk about this morning."
"625740","627880"," Should I get a post out of the streams on Twitter?"
"628120","628360"," Hold on. "
"629980","632520"," I should probably write that down post stream on Twitter."
"635200","640300"," Money markets price in an 80% chance of the first 25 basis point rate."
"640540","644040"," Oh, but buying and selling statement. "
"644040","651050"," And we're going to talk about some stuff this morning."
"653170","661550"," Let me post this really quick on Twitter post the streams on Twitter."
"661890","663390"," I haven't been spending a lot of time on Twitter. "
"663630","670450"," I've been very busy with changes to discord meetings with attorneys meetings with partners meetings"
"670450","675290"," with admins and moderators and content creators and all that kind of stuff."
"677330","679310"," We're trying to line up alliances."
"680550","684070"," We're doing a one of the things we're launching is. "
"685210","687290"," A trade the trigger network."
"689050","690750"," Trade the trigger network."
"691270","692330"," So what does that entail?"
"693430","694430"," We're going to do I and TC. "
"694950","698450"," So we're going to review I and TC today and we're going to review visa today."
"700530","704890"," Now we began what we started doing what we started out here."
"704890","711750"," As a free service for retail investors. "
"715510","716750"," I am TC visa."
"717270","718030"," We started here."
"718310","720570"," The reason we started everything that we do here is because. "
"723710","725730"," There is a there is a time."
"725950","728930"," There was a moment where I was tuning in every day."
"729870","731210"," To a live stream. "
"732210","737530"," While I traded so my training behavior before we began doing we're doing."
"738890","739890"," I had a routine."
"740130","741830"," Most of you have a routine, right?"
"742290","743410"," Is that a routine every night?"
"743810","746970"," I would watch two or three shows recorded shows on YouTube. "
"748390","749530"," Bob Pendle."
"751350","752430"," Who else did I watch?"
"752530","753210"," I watched."
"756030","756630"," Shit. "
"758810","759610"," FX evolution."
"760050","760550"," I'd watch him."
"760790","761210"," I'd watch. "
"762050","762810"," Figuring out money."
"763630","764650"," Watch him as well."
"764970","765430"," Here are the guys. "
"765690","768030"," And then in the morning I get on Twitter."
"768330","769170"," I get on Wall Street bets."
"769650","771630"," I'd get on to investing.com."
"772610","773870"," Check them out late night. "
"774050","774610"," Then I got on Twitter."
"775350","776650"," And then I got on Wall Street bets, right?"
"776890","777690"," Then I'd get in the morning."
"777950","779910"," The morning when the trading days began. "
"780770","781710"," I would get into a discord."
"782710","784990"," Matter of fact, some of you were in that discord with me."
"784990","787210"," I was in another another services discord. "
"788290","789590"," 600 bucks a month."
"790450","792510"," And then I listened to a live stream all day long."
"793630","794930"," A live stream. "
"795790","799610"," That live stream I listened to all day long became defunct."
"802170","804810"," And I started to look around."
"806370","809390"," I started to look around for another live stream and I couldn't find one. "
"810710","811790"," Or one that I liked."
"812550","814030"," A lot of live streams that I found."
"815050","818450"," They were either very obscure or evasive. "
"820870","821750"," Or esoteric."
"823510","826470"," Or intentionally giving you two sides to their thoughts."
"827570","829650"," Or they were fist pumping like bros. "
"829810","830270"," Like what's up bro?"
"830570","831210"," Bring in the show bro."
"831390","832410"," We're a fist pump all day long."
"833390","834290"," Pick out of stuff. "
"835910","837910"," So it wasn't helpful to me."
"837910","839110"," Didn't keep me entertained."
"839670","840290"," Wasn't useful. "
"841150","843190"," Wasn't easy to understand."
"844090","845410"," And it wasn't enjoyable."
"846230","847330"," They missed all three. "
"849150","853550"," And the most critical part was the simplification of concept."
"855410","857010"," I love to sit."
"857230","860690"," I watch options industry council videos. "
"861030","862370"," I listen to them as well."
"863010","864210"," And they're very dry."
"864850","866470"," And they're very complicated. "
"867730","869570"," And I listen to those things."
"869870","870470"," I read books."
"871770","874370"," But that doesn't have anything to do with the fucking price of a stock. "
"874870","879870"," Or nor how the mechanics of a stock price works or the indexes."
"880850","885950"," And what's useful to me in a position or taking a position or exiting a position."
"886570","888950"," So I felt like I was left out. "
"889150","893430"," And then of course I'm watching people get destroyed on social media."
"893890","895050"," Without having basic."
"896330","897490"," Basic tools man. "
"897870","899110"," Like how do I manage this."
"899610","902010"," How do I know that I'm taking something that's just a lottery."
"902350","903290"," How do I know that. "
"903570","905510"," How do I exit and enter a trade when it goes."
"905690","908690"," How do I know that the potential for me to lose."
"909310","913970"," Where can I win the most money where the probability of my hot best win rates are all the different"
"913970","914250"," stuff. "
"914930","917030"," And so we started this."
"917730","922390"," What we're doing here and we've done it now for I think two and a half three years somewhere in"
"922390","922570"," there."
"922570","927430"," And it's grown to a point now where we're making a jump. "
"928150","930710"," We're either going to shut down or we're going to make a jump to one of the other."
"932990","935510"," So I'm loyal to the retail trader."
"935870","941310"," And so there's always going to be a free version of this and it will include everything we've ever"
"941310","941590"," done. "
"942110","947190"," Now there are people that watch the show and support us in a meaningful way."
"948430","949750"," By being here every day."
"950030","950810"," So I owe them that. "
"950810","953970"," And then there's another group of people that are like, Hey, I want to support even more and I want"
"953970","954570"," you to offer more."
"954770","955830"," So well, I'll pay for it."
"955970","959450"," So we're going to try that out to try to make this more permanent. "
"961050","966990"," And in one of those things in that in that in that in that."
"966990","974210"," And that mission statement of being there for the retail trader."
"975410","978190"," One of the things we're going to do is create a network. "
"979190","985190"," A place for the people out there that contribute."
"987510","989610"," To the retail trader community."
"990310","996310"," So you guys see me on Twitter sometimes talking about how appreciative I am of. "
"997270","1001290"," People like Andy constant or Jedi Marcus or."
"1003110","1007390"," Gem or who ever even guys that have five followers."
"1008810","1010850"," You'll see me ask you on the stream. "
"1011430","1014950"," Hey, if you got five followers, you want somebody to follow you and you post constructive cool"
"1014950","1016690"," stuff ship post, whatever it is you do."
"1017530","1022210"," If you're adding to the conversation or you're funny as hell or you just not some fucking internet"
"1022210","1022870"," troll on Twitter."
"1023369","1024150"," I'll follow you. "
"1024290","1027790"," I don't care if you have one follower, especially if you're contributing."
"1028829","1030150"," And in a meaningful way."
"1030450","1035310"," And so I do I follow people all the time that have one follower, two followers, whatever. "
"1035470","1037089"," Matter of fact, I just went through and called the list."
"1039730","1041650"," Because I like I follow a bunch of people."
"1041810","1043150"," They'll be like, Hey, cap, follow me. "
"1043210","1043950"," And they'll like follow me."
"1044250","1047250"," And then they dump me as soon as I follow them so that they just look cool."
"1047910","1052430"," And then I go through their handles and I'm like, Oh, that guy's just an asshole poor troll or"
"1052430","1052690"," whatever. "
"1053410","1054950"," So I just called the list recently."
"1056830","1059890"," I went through every single person I follow, find out what they follow me back."
"1060390","1062110"," And if they don't, I call them. "
"1062290","1064570"," If they're trolls, I call them that kind of stuff."
"1064850","1070730"," So anyways, this trade, the trigger network that we're trying to create would give a space."
"1073310","1077390"," Free away for someone to present their ideas and thoughts. "
"1079410","1084290"," In a meaningful way, an extension from Twitter, not that you don't stand Twitter, but just get an"
"1084290","1084650"," extension."
"1084990","1087850"," So we'll talk about that later on today and some of those changes that are coming."
"1090210","1091090"," It's really cool. "
"1091310","1098170"," So anyways, talk we're going to have at this moment before we continue this morning is because I"
"1098170","1100350"," have to have some work I have to do today."
"1100490","1104530"," But I want to ask you guys a question about format of this show."
"1104530","1107390"," Oh, hold on, let's do this really quick. "
"1108010","1111250"," We just broke through this this art yellow bar right here."
"1111750","1113690"," And we got to do the next tag right here."
"1113870","1115510"," We want to break through this one. "
"1115690","1118350"," And then we want to break through this one right here."
"1120410","1121830"," And smash through."
"1122250","1124510"," We're going to briefly go over to SPX. "
"1125410","1129010"," And we had a nice hard bounce this morning on the half hour trigger."
"1129610","1135350"," And we're going to try to come up here and tag forty nine hundred one more time."
"1135790","1139890"," I do have one concern here that we that we train. "
"1140130","1144490"," If you look at the bottom screen or down here that we come up here and slam into this forty"
"1144490","1145070"," nine hundred."
"1145450","1146930"," And then hold on here."
"1150530","1155570"," Slam up here is forty nine hundred and then bounce down to the hourly trigger. "
"1156510","1160490"," Okay, so just be careful of this right here or we come up here and just bounce around is kind"
"1160490","1162150"," of grind on this forty nine hundred."
"1163790","1165650"," Now, do we have more upside potential?"
"1166070","1166590"," Yes, we do."
"1166710","1170990"," And we're going to look at that at some point this morning on the seasonality calendar. "
"1171610","1174730"," But it's going to bring up the next thing that this important part they got to talk to you about."
"1175370","1176890"," Because we're getting close to the first."
"1177650","1178610"," The candle is burning. "
"1180510","1181190"," I'm paranoid."
"1181190","1183430"," I'm in like full stress mode right now."
"1183610","1185730"," Like I'm panic stress right now. "
"1186150","1189650"," Because as we think that we only like, oh, this is going to be easy."
"1189910","1195150"," We're finding it's more difficult than it is bottlenecks bottlenecks bottlenecks bottlenecks."
"1195290","1203370"," And I'm like, I don't have time here to get through for that launch on the first properly. "
"1203610","1210330"," So I'm going to ask you some questions here in the stream and find what your thoughts are."
"1211430","1216390"," This is your time right now to give me your yay or yay or nay."
"1216550","1220130"," Do you like this or don't like this idea or concept?"
"1221230","1229230"," So after the first, we're going to change the four where we are proposing to change the format of"
"1229230","1230910"," the show slightly. "
"1232190","1234970"," So you would still see everything here as we have it."
"1235450","1237350"," You'd still see the day trading stuff."
"1238350","1240250"," You know, like you run zero. "
"1240410","1245150"," So the idea here is that the zero dates and stuff and the inter-day trading is fun."
"1245770","1248050"," It keeps people happy and active and all that stuff, right?"
"1248250","1249230"," Everyone likes the action."
"1249530","1251230"," Nobody wants to see some guy out there. "
"1252330","1253070"," It's funny too."
"1253170","1254150"," I got a close friend of mine, right?"
"1254610","1255750"," He likes to sell premium."
"1256710","1257810"," That's a great money maker. "
"1258410","1259010"," It does really well."
"1259250","1260750"," You can make a lot of money doing it."
"1261170","1262890"," But you can't do a show based on it. "
"1263650","1264870"," No one wants that show."
"1264870","1271930"," People want the show where they're taking a position, any position, and they want to show up and be"
"1271930","1273190"," like, Hey, man, I'm taking this position."
"1273690","1274910"," Are you b-b-b-rolls here, bro?"
"1275090","1276050"," Are you-are you bearish?"
"1277230","1278510"," You got good market awareness?"
"1278950","1279410"," Where-where are we going?"
"1279890","1281630"," And that's what they want. "
"1282250","1283050"," And a live stream."
"1284210","1286650"," And circling back to what I discussed with you earlier."
"1287950","1290370"," At nighttime, I watched my recorded show, right?"
"1290370","1293090"," Uh, what's-who's the guy?"
"1293510","1294410"," Wolf of Wall Street?"
"1294810","1298930"," If you want your bear, you want your injection of bear juice?"
"1299410","1301310"," I go watch Wolf of Wall Street, guys, fucking phenomenal. "
"1301910","1302850"," Like, you want to get bared up?"
"1303510","1304890"," I show up and watch that show at nighttime."
"1305290","1307770"," That 45 minute presentation he does, and it's fucking awesome."
"1308770","1313250"," Uh, if I want to get all bolded up on Tesla, I can go to any number of Tesla, uh,"
"1313470","1316070"," video makers, and I get all bolded up on Tesla, right?"
"1316250","1318950"," So whatever you-whatever you want to be drinking that nighttime, that's what you do. "
"1318950","1321510"," Uh, you want to look at some TA?"
"1321950","1323270"," You go over to figuring out money, right?"
"1323950","1326090"," Uh, do that kind of stuff, uh, with that guy, right?"
"1326250","1334090"," So during the daytime, our live stream's basically focused on, um, market, uh, cash markets, one"
"1334090","1336350"," minute, five minute chart, and what's happening."
"1337030","1338630"," Now, that'll-that'll remain."
"1339930","1341910"," But we're going to switch to segments. "
"1344090","1344470"," Consistently."
"1345170","1349510"," It's like you show up in the morning, and you're going to get, uh, you know, at 9.30, we"
"1349510","1355510"," do this at 10 a.m., we do that at, um, 11, at 10.30, or 11, or 12, or"
"1355510","1360290"," 1 p.m., we do this at 2 p.m., at 3.30, blah, blah, so on, so forth, whatever."
"1361090","1364650"," Uh, so I'm going to-I'm going to read some stuff off to you. "
"1365590","1366570"," Maybe I'll just show it to you."
"1366610","1367650"," I don't-I don't know if I can."
"1367790","1368730"," Maybe I can show it to you. "
"1369470","1370950"," Here, I'll try to show it to you right now."
"1373700","1374960"," So here, we'll write it out together."
"1375300","1375620"," How about that?"
"1375780","1376940"," We'll-or I'll read it. "
"1376940","1380900"," I'm going to ask you some-I'm going to ask you about some segments, and you tell me if you"
"1380900","1384720"," are interested in having these segments on the show."
"1386080","1387200"," We'll start here."
"1390560","1391940"," How are you guys doing this morning?"
"1392080","1392520"," Good to see you all. "
"1394360","1395820"," Yeah, I love all of you guys out there."
"1395920","1397960"," Do this-we got so much cool shit going on."
"1398040","1401900"," It's going to be cool as fuck, so, uh, I got some-I got some questions for you. "
"1402420","1405920"," You got-the best part, too, is we're not a mature show."
"1405920","1408060"," Uh, we're like a beta show."
"1408280","1408780"," We're like beta. "
"1409080","1410500"," We're like alpha beta."
"1410580","1415120"," Like, we don't even have a launch-a truly launch, uh, what we do yet."
"1416300","1417340"," We're just getting there. "
"1418060","1419560"," Uh, we've had amazing growth, too."
"1419880","1424080"," Like, a lot of guys out there, man, they're like, streamed to, like, two people for, like, three"
"1424080","1426180"," years until they start to get traction."
"1426520","1428760"," So we've done really well getting to where we are at this point. "
"1429400","1432460"," Um, unexpectedly so, for sure."
"1433340","1438900"," And, uh, right now, I think we're averaging six-four to six thousand people a day right now, which"
"1438900","1439180"," is insane."
"1440080","1440680"," Real viewers. "
"1441440","1443240"," I just-um, as a matter of fact, I just got out of a meeting this morning."
"1444380","1447560"," And we were just-I was discussing with, uh, a partner."
"1449540","1454460"," Uh, real viewership versus paid viewership. "
"1456440","1457540"," And I mean fake viewers."
"1458620","1462440"," Uh, so now I haven't been-uh, you haven't been seeing my face this week, right?"
"1462440","1464480"," But last week you were up until Friday."
"1465400","1467940"," We're averaging up until last week when I'm on the show. "
"1468900","1472620"," Uh, six thousand viewers a day before we even get to nighttime."
"1473300","1475840"," Uh, people coming back to check, uh, segments."
"1476700","1478260"," The-six thousand is insane. "
"1479600","1484040"," There are live streamers during the daytime that pay for fake viewers."
"1484820","1487840"," So you'll have-you'll like-you'll like go and see their live stream."
"1488140","1490760"," It'll show they had, like, I don't know, fifteen thousand. "
"1491840","1493260"," Twenty thousand viewers."
"1494320","1498760"," We can look and-we've looked in the background to see if those are real viewers or not."
"1498900","1499140"," They're fake. "
"1499800","1500620"," They pay for them."
"1501220","1502080"," And it's easy to see."
"1502480","1505860"," We've-we can actually see-here you wanna see something crazy. "
"1506620","1512700"," One of our developers can see if you have paid for followers on Twitter."
"1513940","1517620"," I can go on your-I'm serious."
"1517620","1520000"," I can go on your Twitter account. "
"1521120","1524700"," If you have a million followers, I can go on your Twitter account."
"1525400","1530620"," And point out, now I-I didn't develop this, but our developer developed it."
"1532440","1535380"," We can find out if you paid for your followers. "
"1536360","1541740"," We-we can go to the day you bought those followers and show them to you."
"1542180","1546820"," Now we don't-we don't expose those people on social media."
"1546820","1547880"," And I wouldn't. "
"1548360","1552600"," I'm not going to-I'm not gonna-I'm not gonna attract that."
"1554360","1558200"," I've done that before, and I attract unwanted attention."
"1561340","1568020"," So, like, the last time I did something like that, they said, show me-they said, show me your"
"1568020","1569160"," screener of it. "
"1569700","1576160"," And I'm like, they're not asking me to show me their screener because they wanna fix it."
"1576160","1581980"," They wanna ban me from-this was it not Twitter was something else, but at any rate."
"1583680","1587620"," We can tell if-if they have unorganic followers. "
"1588760","1596440"," And the reason that people do this-unorganic, unorganic followers-followers is because when they"
"1596440","1599760"," get caught by the advertisers, it doesn't matter anymore."
"1600760","1602580"," So let me explain that better to you."
"1603360","1605140"," What we could have done here. "
"1606600","1607160"," Anywhere."
"1607280","1609720"," We could have done this on Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, anywhere."
"1610380","1613320"," We could have bought inorganic followers. "
"1616780","1622900"," Initially, maybe make some Google AdSense or get sponsorships from, let's say, Twitch or YouTube or"
"1622900","1623120"," something."
"1624080","1631320"," And by the time they caught us and banned us from that revenue generation, it wouldn't matter"
"1631320","1636940"," because we would have already secured real followers and real sponsorships."
"1637260","1643120"," It's a really gross thing that happens in social media. "
"1644280","1645720"," We chose not to do that here."
"1646200","1656040"," The point being that our growth has been organic, no one can look at our growth and"
"1656040","1665840"," say, we can always pay for this or bought this fake growth in a community."
"1666580","1668500"," Our community is real here is my point. "
"1669380","1670880"," You guys are all real."
"1671900","1673080"," The Discord is all real."
"1673300","1674140"," Twitter is all real. "
"1674360","1679640"," There's no fake growth in what we do here in this community."
"1680280","1681800"," That's a fascinating cool-ass thing."
"1683440","1692580"," I'm asking you as our community to give me your insight into what we should do next. "
"1693900","1700020"," My faith is in you and not in inorganic growth for what we do."
"1700620","1706500"," My faith is in you growing this community or not growing this community or the direction of this"
"1706500","1708600"," community where we go from here."
"1711180","1714700"," So, dude, I need to shut the fuck up sometimes. "
"1718620","1726280"," If we were to have the show every morning at 9.30 on a consistent basis, Monday through Friday,"
"1729560","1733260"," we're going to have the show Monday through Friday."
"1733420","1737340"," You're not going to be able to have just me every single day of the year."
"1737340","1741760"," We will likely have other people, though, stand in. "
"1742080","1748940"," Like, if you watch a show on TV, and remember, Johnny Carson used to have a guest host, right?"
"1749320","1754540"," So, if we had a guest host like Binky or a guest host like Trader Podcast or someone like that,"
"1754700","1754820"," right?"
"1755640","1759480"," We were able to show up with you and you had a show every day and every trading day of"
"1759480","1759840"," the year."
"1759840","1768380"," AIA natural gas change forecast minus 318 BCF on the prior minus 154 BCF."
"1770440","1771400"," Excuse me. "
"1772800","1781060"," We thought about making it more at the show more structured where you could anticipate specific"
"1781060","1787080"," things at not necessarily exact time, but if it's relevant that you would expect certain things to"
"1787080","1792600"," happen in the show that you could tune into, or you could come back to in the future and look"
"1792600","1793940"," at a specific time period."
"1794440","1798380"," You could say every day at 9.30 does a market brief."
"1799100","1804140"," Every day at 11 o'clock or if she does this, 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock, she does"
"1804140","1804440"," that. "
"1805280","1807500"," So, let me ask you some questions here, okay?"
"1808660","1816900"," And we'll get into the schedule of it later, but just for the ideas on segments, let me ask you"
"1816900","1817380"," some questions."
"1818280","1825340"," And I'm going to go to the chat here and try to read your responses to these questions that I"
"1825340","1825960"," have for you."
"1826600","1830260"," As we make this jump, it's important for more consistency. "
"1830260","1836960"," One of the parts of this jump that we're making is, or should be a benefit of it."
"1837820","1841720"," If there are people out there that are going to support this show on a regular basis, what we do"
"1841720","1846200"," in a website and all this other stuff, like we talked about how we have to protect the Discord"
"1846200","1847020"," community, right?"
"1847280","1849100"," It's protect what's going on in there."
"1850220","1852000"," Keep it vibrant, all that kind of stuff. "
"1852000","1857780"," We have a website, have tools and places for you to go for data and for tools, indicators, all"
"1857780","1858580"," kinds of the stupid shit."
"1858800","1862100"," And then market briefs, all kinds of more consistency."
"1863280","1868600"," And then so that you can rely upon us, rely upon a show, rely upon blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
"1868860","1868860"," blah. "
"1871020","1873780"," So, I have them listed, not in order."
"1874680","1877640"," I'll put them in order later and ask you if that order works for you."
"1878440","1886840"," But if we, on a consistent basis, offered these segments every day or in season or when an event is"
"1886840","1888540"," going to happen, please let me know in the chat. "
"1889340","1894660"," So, number one, if we showed up in the morning the first half an hour or 15 minutes or so,"
"1894960","1898100"," focus on a market's brief."
"1898950","1904920"," And that would be where I read to you an expectation for the day."
"1905680","1910100"," I read to you or we discuss economic news. "
"1912320","1914320"," That would be a calendar, right?"
"1914640","1918380"," Economic news calendar, like we expect this at this time, we expect that at that time."
"1919140","1921800"," What should happen or not happen depending upon those reports."
"1922420","1931060"," And then maybe discuss the hot, the trending topic of the day, something that's on CNBC or trending"
"1931060","1931600"," on Twitter. "
"1932760","1939300"," And then some of the other data that's coming out from like a news service, economic data."
"1940680","1946240"," So, a market brief every morning, let's say at 9.30 to 9.45. Just start the show and say,"
"1946780","1950140"," hey, I'm going to give you a morning brief, quick synopsis for the day."
"1953860","1960400"," Economic calendar, trending news on CNBC or Twitter. "
"1961440","1964980"," And then maybe like a new squawk data."
"1966080","1967640"," Does that work for you guys or no?"
"1967640","1970180"," We're going to go from one to each one."
"1970380","1974480"," So, don't, don't post anything yet on stuff you haven't heard yet. "
"1974620","1980980"," After I get done going to the list, we'll take your input on pay at this segment or consider that"
"1980980","1981840"," segment or whatever."
"1982480","1985320"," So the first one would be a market brief in the morning."
"1987660","1991500"," The next, we then lead into market positioning for the day. "
"1992060","1998100"," So the next segment would be, this is what I expect to happen from, I don't know, from here to"
"1998100","1998740"," there or whatever."
"1999160","2002580"," So the market breathes for a half an hour, right."
"2002860","2007960"," And then right around that nine, or excuse me, 10 a.m., 10.45, or excuse me, 9.45, 10"
"2007960","2013520"," a.m. We position ourselves for the day until about two about 1.30 in the afternoon. "
"2016820","2020720"," Do you guys want to do the market brief at 9 a.m. or 8.30?"
"2021100","2022380"," So let's talk about this one segment."
"2023060","2027520"," Do you prefer the show to start at 8.30 or 9 a.m. to do that market brief?"
"2028680","2029620"," Someone's saying that."
"2030360","2033840"," Someone here is saying market brief before the market opens. "
"2035080","2035780"," Just saying that."
"2036760","2038700"," Manvera, Momo was saying yes, start earlier."
"2040140","2040940"," Hold on here. "
"2041640","2042400"," Check YouTube."
"2045760","2046680"," Oh, no, dude."
"2046900","2048719"," Tesla's going to 60 bucks, $64. "
"2049340","2050639"," There'll be a, there'll be a squeeze."
"2051699","2053060"," We'll talk about Tesla later."
"2054040","2055880"," Tesla's going to 64 fucking dollars. "
"2056780","2058920"," And we're going to talk about Tesla."
"2059239","2060120"," Tesla, dude."
"2060520","2063800"," Now a little squeeze at some point, but, you know, it doesn't go straight down, but it's going to"
"2063800","2064400"," 64 bucks. "
"2065100","2072960"," Tesla's going, if any of you are longtime Tesla traders and investors, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015."
"2074540","2078080"," We are in a major re-pricing of Tesla in my view."
"2078540","2080020"," So we're going to talk about that at some point. "
"2081080","2083639"," We're going to stand focused on topic here."
"2083780","2085620"," Do you guys prefer the stream starts earlier?"
"2087000","2087800"," 8.30 or 9?"
"2088100","2090540"," I don't know if it's 8.30. Like that's too early, dude."
"2090679","2091260"," Nobody's showing up. "
"2092340","2093100"," You might show up."
"2093380","2095780"," How about 9 or 9.15?"
"2098100","2098580"," Okay."
"2098760","2100640"," So before policy, before market open. "
"2106390","2106870"," Okay."
"2107090","2109250"," So we'll do a market brief."
"2110570","2114290"," That's the, the, like a newsletter that I read to you from us. "
"2114790","2121290"," And then a economic news calendar that I read to you from a calendar."
"2121930","2126830"," And then highlight some kind of trending news from CNBC or Twitter, somewhere I was trending for"
"2126830","2127130"," the day."
"2128410","2130930"," Maybe even a heat map, like what's going up, what's going down. "
"2139350","2142930"," And then economic data that's been released either in the overnight or that morning."
"2143430","2145810"," So 9.15, we can get that done in 15 minutes."
"2146930","2150130"," And then at 9.30, right on the bell, we'll do positioning. "
"2150790","2151550"," Does that work for you guys?"
"2151730","2153270"," You guys like the positioning right off the bell?"
"2154490","2154990"," That's fine."
"2155310","2157730"," So then at 9.30, we'll do the market positioning."
"2162880","2172160"," So on February 1, we will change the start time of the show to 9.15. So you know, nobody's"
"2172160","2172900"," people. "
"2173200","2176260"," I know you guys at home are like, I ain't fucking show up the market till 9."
"2176480","2179380"," Goddamn 30, like 9.28. I'm going to open my fucking laptop."
"2180520","2182000"," I'm shit posted on Twitter."
"2182660","2189520"," I got to get all my fucking shit posted and done before 9.30. So 9.15. We'll do a"
"2189520","2190000"," market brief. "
"2190740","2193540"," Okay, 9.30. The opening bell."
"2193840","2194880"," We'll call it the opening bell."
"2195020","2196440"," Market positioning, the opening bell. "
"2205860","2206700"," I like that."
"2209420","2212160"," Now the rest of these are not time-based."
"2213840","2214880"," Not time-based. "
"2215440","2216700"," We've got the market open, right?"
"2216980","2217180"," We're good."
"2217420","2218000"," We've positioned."
"2218400","2218620"," We're good. "
"2219440","2220800"," I'm going to read some stuff off to you."
"2220900","2222160"," Tell me yay or nay on this stuff."
"2224880","2234720"," I've got stock picks. "
"2237340","2256820"," Now this would be, we spent"
"2256820","2260400"," more time on this earlier in the year."
"2260720","2263600"," Last year we spent time on stock picks."
"2264180","2265400"," So an example being here. "
"2266920","2269240"," This is our ETF over here, right?"
"2269860","2274760"," So we have a dedicated segment once or twice a week."
"2274940","2275780"," Mondays and Fridays."
"2277960","2279780"," Dedicated segments, Monday and Friday. "
"2280860","2286040"," We maybe review stocks by this, all that kind of stuff."
"2287380","2289920"," What do we have any stock picks?"
"2291160","2296200"," It's like on a Monday morning, we'd show up on a Monday and say, or maybe Tuesday is better because"
"2296200","2298360"," Tuesday is typically a down day for bullish."
"2298720","2300020"," I don't know, maybe Tuesday is a better day. "
"2317280","2323920"," And that's where we review stocks that are, we want to start paying attention to."
"2324460","2333220"," Now also that stock pick segment will align with a tool that we have on the website."
"2334080","2339480"," So we have a tool on the website that picks stocks to be watching. "
"2340320","2345600"," That same tool will align with these stocks over here."
"2346220","2353640"," So if any come up on the website, we will watch them over here."
"2359600","2364240"," And we'll discuss them on the show on Mondays and Fridays. "
"2364680","2365240"," You want to do that on Monday?"
"2370740","2376340"," Hold your cold, hold someone said, someone just, I don't know who did this, someone said, why don't"
"2376340","2377980"," you do a weekly or daily vote."
"2378840","2381280"," So hold off, write that on a piece of paper at home."
"2382800","2383580"," We're going to get there. "
"2383800","2386260"," I got, I got polls on my, I got, I got that written down already."
"2387020","2388700"," So just give me a second, we got to get through this shit."
"2390440","2394320"," We'll get so caught up and we got to move forward. "
"2394320","2403860"," So just think about this twice a week, twice a week, Mondays or Tuesdays"
"2403860","2404800"," in the chat."
"2405040","2405840"," Tell me Monday or Tuesday."
"2406420","2407400"," It's either Monday or Tuesday. "
"2407660","2415300"," We're going to review stock picks on Mondays or Tuesdays and Friday or Thursday, Tuesday and"
"2415300","2420920"," Thursday, Monday and Thursday, Tuesday and Friday, Monday and Friday, whatever you want."
"2420920","2424060"," Give me both days in the chat room real quick."
"2426100","2426740"," You're fine. "
"2426920","2427440"," Full times through."
"2427600","2428140"," Don't worry about it."
"2429260","2430320"," I didn't always do it. "
"2430560","2432100"," I just, I'm just reading the comments."
"2435220","2435620"," Okay."
"2435840","2437020"," So I like Tuesday too. "
"2437260","2443460"," If you're a bull, Tuesdays are normally a down, if we're in a bull market, Tuesdays are normally a"
"2443460","2445780"," down day, not always, but pretty consistently."
"2446620","2448960"," So it would be one of those days we want to be looking at those, right?"
"2450780","2451720"," Tuesday, Friday."
"2451960","2452060"," Okay. "
"2456730","2457510"," Or you know what?"
"2458150","2463710"," I think we should do it on Monday because if we're up on Monday and then Tuesdays are down day,"
"2464510","2469970"," Monday might be a good day because rather than enter those stocks on Monday, we'd be looking for"
"2469970","2471130"," entry on a Tuesday."
"2472150","2473370"," I think we should do Monday."
"2477380","2478940"," I think we should do Mondays. "
"2479540","2480000"," Oh, wait a minute."
"2480000","2483720"," I got to write that down to discord mat or discord with stock picks."
"2483720","2484180"," Got it. "
"2484380","2486740"," So you want a discord channel dedicated to it."
"2486800","2487020"," Okay."
"2487140","2487340"," Hold on. "
"2490040","2491060"," I think we do Monday."
"2500600","2501040"," Okay."
"2501260","2507260"," So stock picks, we're going to look on Mondays because oftentimes there's two things going on with"
"2507260","2508060"," these stock picks. "
"2509700","2512060"," They usually show up on Monday or on an update."
"2512660","2515900"," They're better when they show up on a down day though on a Tuesday."
"2517340","2522300"," Normally if it's a day where the skirt is lifted up on, you know, it's a Tuesday. "
"2522300","2523220"," Like that."
"2523520","2524320"," Or maybe how about this?"
"2524600","2526680"," I will, I will research some on Monday."
"2534020","2537700"," I will check on Mondays for tickers that are good to go. "
"2538080","2543940"," And then we'll, we'll do it on the show on Tuesdays so if they're still rising on a Tuesday on"
"2543940","2549780"," a down day, we will be able to look up the skirt of hedge funds that are still long while"
"2549780","2550540"," the market's selling."
"2550880","2553400"," So the show will be Tuesday and Friday."
"2553400","2560620"," And I will research on Monday to add to the Tuesday portion of the show. "
"2561700","2566240"," I also wrote down the discord channel to align with the website and the show."
"2566560","2566740"," Okay."
"2567860","2569180"," So let's move on to the next one. "
"2571040","2574080"," The next one is trading concepts."
"2575320","2578420"," This segment should be about five minutes every day."
"2579160","2580620"," It is not the tool. "
"2581060","2582160"," It is trading concepts."
"2582160","2585080"," We're going to start at page one."
"2585980","2586840"," What is a share?"
"2587460","2588140"," What is the stock?"
"2589080","2589860"," Like literally. "
"2590600","2591540"," What is a share?"
"2592120","2593140"," What is the difference?"
"2594520","2598120"," And what we'll do is we'll make our way almost like, you know, in Vestopedia."
"2598700","2600440"," We'll spend five minutes quickly."
"2601800","2603500"," Most of these segments should be really short. "
"2604260","2604980"," That all of them."
"2605380","2606500"," But a lot of them will be short."
"2606500","2611900"," Just five minutes every day on a stock market concept. "
"2613480","2616880"," And we will review them in depth for about five minutes."
"2617180","2617920"," Like this is a share."
"2618340","2618860"," What is a share?"
"2619080","2619620"," This is a stock. "
"2620320","2621040"," What is a dividend?"
"2621940","2622560"," What is an option?"
"2623120","2627340"," And we'll get more complex as time goes on, but we'll do a segment every day."
"2627840","2629160"," Do you like the idea of that?"
"2631000","2631940"," David, how's it going?"
"2633680","2635620"," Yeah, David said, get the fuck up by Thursday."
"2635880","2636320"," Absolutely. "
"2637140","2638980"," Absolutely monetize on Thursday, baby."
"2641960","2643720"," I see David just wrote that."
"2644460","2645060"," You got it. "
"2645100","2645480"," You like that."
"2645560","2645740"," Okay."
"2646320","2646620"," All right. "
"2646620","2647280"," That's a good one."
"2647880","2651020"," The other thing we're going to do is a segment on."
"2652700","2653780"," Trade the trigger. "
"2654200","2654960"," The actual tool."
"2656160","2657520"," The actual tool."
"2657800","2659680"," A segment on that as well. "
"2659680","2664860"," So each day of the week for five minutes, I'll say to you something like, Hey, this is what a"
"2664860","2666040"," three hour look back is."
"2666580","2669040"," Hey, this is what the importance of a weekly trigger."
"2669260","2673320"," Hey, this is the importance of this box over here. "
"2673920","2674840"," This box right here."
"2674920","2676240"," What does this box mean right here?"
"2676880","2678440"," What does that box right there mean?"
"2679660","2681600"," Just five minutes really quick and fast."
"2682020","2685600"," We have an educational video series that is getting released here in the first. "
"2686420","2688820"," But we're going to do just a quick segment every day."
"2689000","2690220"," So that's educational every day."
"2690280","2692160"," You're going to have something five minutes on. "
"2693540","2696980"," I don't know, an investor PDF type book in five minutes on."
"2699100","2700800"," Something specific to what we do here."
"2703390","2703690"," Yeah. "
"2703770","2705110"," Market one on one is a great."
"2705270","2705990"," I'm going to write that in here."
"2706030","2706910"," Market one on one. "
"2707370","2708430"," That's a good name for this."
"2708690","2710330"," Market one on one trading concepts."
"2711590","2714930"," I like that name. "
"2714930","2716010"," Market one on one."
"2717730","2720710"," And then T three tool one on one."
"2727790","2728950"," Next one. "
"2729450","2730390"," Next concept."
"2731170","2733010"," We'll highlight every day."
"2733970","2736930"," Something major on the market. "
"2737470","2739310"," Either ER season."
"2739950","2742410"," Rates decision coming up."
"2743070","2746630"," We'll focus on even if it's just brief. "
"2747430","2749230"," If there's if I said this."
"2750490","2751970"," This wouldn't be every day."
"2752150","2752810"," This would only be one. "
"2754010","2758430"," The examples I have here are earning season or rates decision."
"2759270","2762630"," So if we're not earning season, we won't spend a segment on that."
"2762750","2769350"," But every day we'll spend at least five minutes on if we're in earning season or coming into a rate"
"2769350","2770690"," decision or something like that. "
"2770830","2772550"," Some major, major market event."
"2774030","2775450"," Big news, big movers."
"2777970","2779330"," Let me move this over here. "
"2779450","2781070"," Pay attention to what you guys are doing over here."
"2781210","2781550"," Hold on here."
"2788900","2791320"," Move that over here so you can see that right there. "
"2796090","2796770"," They're monetizing."
"2796930","2798150"," You guys know what they're doing today, right?"
"2798510","2800370"," David AMS just said and I said to you earlier."
"2801470","2802910"," Thursday is when they monetize. "
"2810030","2811670"," This is when you take your profit on the week."
"2812530","2816130"," So if you were long this week and you're trying to take profit, this is your time to do it"
"2816130","2816750"," today on Thursday."
"2821990","2827050"," Okay, so we've got a major news segment. "
"2830110","2834930"," Another segment would be interact with chat."
"2836110","2840970"," This would be something where I spend specifically, and I think this is in the middle of the"
"2840970","2841510"," afternoon."
"2842910","2843890"," Likely around. "
"2844350","2846930"," Usually it's like right around like that one o'clock in the afternoon."
"2848270","2849730"," One 30 somewhere in there."
"2849870","2851210"," There's usually like or even two 30. "
"2851330","2856070"," You know that time in the afternoon where we get that sideways action and a decision if we're going"
"2856070","2860850"," to pull back into the close or we're going to go up into the or pull up into the end"
"2860850","2861230"," of the close."
"2862030","2863990"," Another section would be interact with the chat."
"2864230","2869570"," That would be where if you want me to chart something for you, I'm going to answer a question for"
"2869570","2871530"," you more in depth. "
"2872470","2872690"," Does that."
"2873770","2880190"," I mean like I do like I actually bring something up on the screen that says, I don't know."
"2881570","2882910"," Fireside chat time. "
"2883550","2886110"," So you'll see like a new screen up here."
"2886890","2888270"," Like an interlude."
"2889850","2891810"," And it says fireside chat. "
"2892390","2893490"," We'll call it that fireside chat."
"2894290","2896190"," Contract chat time fireside chat."
"2903250","2907950"," Where I specifically focus on the chat and say, Hey, what are you guys want to talk about now?"
"2912080","2919760"," Count building strategies are going to be a part of the education and our educational partners. "
"2920640","2925540"," So John L David AMS people like that are going to be doing taking care of that."
"2925700","2928600"," That's going to be a one on one thing with you guys."
"2929680","2932340"," So do you guys like the fireside chat concept?"
"2932460","2938720"," Yes or no?"
"2938720","2942320"," I would put a I would put a bug. "
"2942500","2946600"," I'd put something funny on me to put an ask out on and I like a smoking pipe or something."
"2948280","2950020"," By the way, where is my smoking pipe?"
"2950380","2951680"," I have a smoking pipe I got."
"2953000","2953920"," That's gotten pipe. "
"2954720","2955000"," Okay."
"2955100","2955540"," Yeah, like that."
"2957700","2963820"," In that time period, we'd also maybe chart tickers for you if I have time one or two tickers or"
"2963820","2964180"," something. "
"2973290","2976710"," That segment would last about 15 minutes, maybe even a half an hour."
"2976930","2979270"," I have a 5% earlier in this pipe not bound."
"2979570","2979970"," Tweet jacket. "
"2981430","2982210"," Pull out here."
"2983030","2986390"," Ascot pipe and a smoking jacket."
"2986890","2987630"," I'll buy that shit. "
"2988070","2989010"," I'll buy the smoking jacket."
"2989450","2989850"," I have the pipe."
"2991050","2993310"," I'll buy the ascot and the smoking jacket this week. "
"3000420","3001460"," I think that'd be funny as fuck."
"3002580","3006980"," Like I think maybe I can sew it all together and like rip it off and throw it on or"
"3006980","3007300"," something."
"3008940","3010000"," Yeah, bong it three. "
"3016420","3017900"," Oh, John L, by the way."
"3018020","3019240"," You guys want to know where John L is?"
"3019700","3023380"," John L, I don't can't divulge too much because he likes privacy."
"3024120","3032020"," John L simply put bought another house, a kickass house somewhere that does not have internet and"
"3032020","3033900"," he's trying to get internet to that new home. "
"3035140","3039700"," So what I've been told over time is that it's taking more time than he expected."
"3041480","3044340"," I'm not going to tell you where he lives and that kind of stuff, but he's got a compound."
"3048120","3054920"," As my internet finally working properly, generally, yes, I switched from Comcast commercial to"
"3054920","3055440"," fiber. "
"3056600","3061280"," I've had a much better, much better internet connection as of late."
"3061280","3065100"," Every once in a while, I still run into some problems, but not much."
"3065480","3071860"," Like I ran into some equipment problems or powers out that kind of stuff, but other than that, way"
"3071860","3078180"," more consistent uptime off of the stream than I've ever had in the past with Comcast. "
"3078700","3079840"," Comcast sucked, man."
"3080180","3081340"," It was fucking bad."
"3082500","3092260"," My electric issues have gone down a ton due to them repairing so much of our neighborhood, so we're"
"3092260","3093460"," doing pretty well here right now. "
"3095880","3097920"," I fucking love Hunter S Thompson, man."
"3098440","3101060"," I love Bukowski, Hunter S Thompson."
"3102400","3103080"," You know what?"
"3103180","3110260"," Who's my real favorite is Hemingway?"
"3110740","3119780"," I had no appreciation for Hemingway when I was young and I thought he"
"3119780","3124780"," was like a football jock guy. "
"3125160","3129980"," I was more like a soccer guy, skiing guy, skateboarder."
"3133400","3139960"," Instead of being like, instead of being into top 40 music or rap music or that kind of stuff, I"
"3139960","3144660"," was always into party, rave kid stuff and alternative rap and that kind of stuff."
"3144660","3148740"," I was always like slightly alternative, I guess. "
"3149000","3155600"," That's a word way to say it, but so I always blew off Hemingway, but I have a great appreciation"
"3155600","3156400"," for him."
"3157000","3158920"," He's lived especially in today's world."
"3159280","3162860"," He's lived more in one finger than a lot of people today. "
"3163300","3165160"," We got a lot of, everybody's arm tearing out there, right?"
"3165300","3165640"," Even me, right?"
"3165760","3166280"," We're all arm tearing."
"3167240","3171580"," Go on Reddit and you go on Reddit and you see like some, like see some like one person died"
"3171580","3175940"," this one horrific way and you go in the comment section and people are like, that's why you never"
"3175940","3176620"," swim in the ocean."
"3177720","3179460"," You never swim in the ocean. "
"3179720","3180700"," Don't ever go in the ocean."
"3180860","3181800"," The rip current is going to kill you."
"3183060","3184520"," Always, you're going to die from rip currents. "
"3185180","3185800"," That's not true."
"3187100","3193420"," Most people don't, or if you're a good, if you were raised swimming in ponds and pools in the"
"3193420","3196660"," ocean, most people don't die from rip currents."
"3197320","3200440"," If you're a surfer, you don't know, you get dragged out in the ocean. "
"3200640","3201760"," You do, you swim with it."
"3201760","3206380"," And then you come back in about an old mile down the coast and you're fine."
"3206500","3207840"," A shark didn't eat you. "
"3208180","3209540"," And you live."
"3209720","3211140"," I've been pulled out of a rip cart, by the way."
"3211740","3215880"," Matter of fact, I was pulled out with my wife and my brother out of a rip cart once. "
"3216360","3216980"," Like, you know what I mean?"
"3217180","3222520"," Like, Hemingway to me, especially in today's day and age, a guy's gangster or was a gangster."
"3223440","3224180"," Pretty kill themselves."
"3227960","3228360"," Yeah. "
"3228980","3229180"," Yeah."
"3231760","3232700"," Well, that guy's living is my point."
"3233060","3234760"," Hemingway is a good example of living life. "
"3235680","3236980"," That guy lived life, man."
"3237500","3238620"," Up and down, sideways."
"3239040","3239940"," The guy did everything. "
"3240700","3242120"," So anyways, let's move on."
"3242940","3245500"," We did the fireside chat every day."
"3247740","3249160"," Next one I have is pole. "
"3250220","3252120"," So we'll do a pole every day."
"3253000","3255040"," Now we should probably do the pole in the morning, right?"
"3255840","3256940"," So I'm going to move that one up."
"3259100","3259960"," Hold on here. "
"3259960","3264900"," Well, the pole will start the pole every morning before the beginning of the show."
"3266780","3267920"," So, well, how about this?"
"3268020","3269640"," We'll start the pole before the open."
"3274610","3280610"," So when you arrive in the morning, there'll be a pole that will ask you a question. "
"3287570","3291410"," So if you show up in the morning and you see the chat, there should be a boom, a question"
"3291410","3293430"," for you every morning before the open."
"3293910","3294410"," Does that work?"
"3294850","3294950"," Pole."
"3295590","3295890"," Every day. "
"3299120","3302400"," Do you like the idea of having a pole that you come in to in the morning?"
"3303400","3305600"," You can interact with it or not."
"3306340","3308100"," But you like the idea of a pole every morning."
"3312920","3317680"," A sudden over end says most people die drinking too much salt water. "
"3318700","3320080"," Not from the rip current."
"3324860","3325600"," Okay, pole."
"3325860","3326300"," We got the pole. "
"3329410","3331690"," Now, when will I invite Jedi Marcus in the show?"
"3332070","3339430"," I have not done that yet, but I have been talking over the past year to to via DM with"
"3339430","3340030"," Jedi Marcus."
"3340330","3341690"," I would really like to get."
"3341990","3343210"," I'll be honest with you guys. "
"3344430","3347110"," Like I'm at this point knowing Jedi Marcus."
"3348510","3352490"," Where I'm hoping that at some point."
"3353830","3357970"," To engage him to shine a light on us. "
"3357970","3360270"," In some way in a more regular basis."
"3361030","3362610"," He might say no to that."
"3363690","3365370"," He's a very private person. "
"3365990","3367630"," In real life, he's very."
"3370110","3371410"," Just a chill guy."
"3372190","3373550"," He already reminds me of. "
"3374430","3376770"," In real life or at least on phone."
"3377710","3379250"," Jedi reminds me of."
"3380550","3383210"," Was it the big shorts where. "
"3384630","3387030"," Oh, what's his name Brad Pitt was in Colorado."
"3387610","3391950"," And he had like long hair and he wasn't dressed in a suit any longer."
"3392130","3397170"," He had like his tweed on and he's like, I had a professional career and now I just hang out"
"3397170","3397690"," of my ranch. "
"3399170","3401790"," And you're lucky I take your fucking phone call."
"3403430","3404130"," But nicely."
"3406470","3407530"," Yeah, Ben Rickett. "
"3408110","3409390"," Yeah, he's been record."
"3410750","3417650"," So I don't know if he'll say yes to that, but I'm hoping I can at least approach him on"
"3417650","3417830"," that."
"3418250","3421330"," I can't say to you that he's going to say yes to that. "
"3421690","3422570"," He has a great life."
"3424090","3426470"," At this point is where he is."
"3427050","3428650"," Where it's just nice to chat with him. "
"3428810","3431810"," So I don't know if he'll say yes to that, but I am going to ask at some point."
"3433030","3436170"," To ask him to be like our granddad or our dad."
"3436630","3442190"," Can you show up dad for once a week or once every three months if something's important or"
"3442190","3443650"," something like that. "
"3443730","3445970"," So yes, we'd like to engage him at some point."
"3445970","3446870"," Absolutely."
"3448730","3451210"," Yeah, I like that I'm in a personal level. "
"3451270","3451790"," I like him."
"3452350","3453570"," I like his pragmatism."
"3453930","3455190"," I look up to him. "
"3455390","3458630"," He is someone that I defer to."
"3459790","3460830"," One hundred percent."
"3461410","3464370"," He's someone that I really appreciate him as a person. "
"3464770","3467330"," Really appreciate his knowledge and wisdom."
"3468710","3469990"," Yeah, like a godfather."
"3470150","3470430"," Absolutely. "
"3471550","3480080"," I don't know if that shows better, but there you go."
"3485330","3488230"," So, okay, so we did the poll before the open."
"3489710","3495830"," Now, would you guys like to see an interview on a more consistent schedule?"
"3496770","3504630"," Like once a week, once a month, once a day, would you like to see me have someone on the"
"3504630","3511130"," show for 15 minutes, half an hour an hour, once a week?"
"3511330","3512410"," Is there a time frame?"
"3512850","3514770"," Maybe it's just not important days. "
"3517110","3526690"," Maybe I have only have an interview subject on during an ER report or only before a fed day"
"3526690","3529810"," or would you like to have like once a week, we have somebody on."
"3529950","3532810"," I try to try to get someone on the show once a week."
"3539560","3540860"," Once or twice a week. "
"3541500","3542380"," Do an interview."
"3542760","3542940"," Okay."
"3545860","3548400"," Okay, so an interview once a week. "
"3551010","3552410"," You listen to this, Binky."
"3553990","3555950"," Now we can get like Dre on."
"3556210","3558890"," We can get Krista Marco on. "
"3559030","3559530"," We can get."
"3560770","3566530"," There's a bunch of people like Jenna Marcus or Val Wiz or Joe Dona or trader podcast."
"3568230","3570890"," Black Swan, whoever it is out there, we can get on the show. "
"3570990","3576230"," We'll get on the show and give them a place to you guys can meet them and find out more"
"3576230","3576870"," about who they are."
"3581800","3583060"," Once a week, guests will be cool."
"3583300","3583460"," Okay. "
"3584600","3585140"," Good morning."
"3585280","3585360"," Kim."
"3585560","3585860"," How are you?"
"3589580","3591700"," Guests at a slow day, no longer than an hour. "
"3591840","3594360"," Yeah, there seems to be like there's a sweet spot, right?"
"3594620","3596340"," Well, you know what else people have said to me?"
"3596400","3600440"," It's better not to have a guest on when we're in the middle of something either."
"3600440","3606580"," Like when the feds actually doing their report or their interview, it's better to just focus on"
"3606580","3607740"," that than interview somebody."
"3608220","3610360"," Better to like maybe have it in the morning before. "
"3612480","3616640"," Like a rate decision or like we'll just said a couple days before."
"3617080","3620100"," I don't know if that was will, but somebody said the Netflix thing."
"3620300","3622380"," So you like have them on a day before or something like that. "
"3623780","3625080"," Yeah, quality over quantity."
"3625680","3625840"," Agreed."
"3626040","3626220"," Okay. "
"3626380","3626780"," Gotcha."
"3626780","3636580"," I also thought about doing a segment"
"3636580","3644680"," at some points in the day, an index and sector watch where we just briefly go over the major"
"3644680","3645180"," indexes."
"3645660","3650820"," Just take a look at them and then take a look at all the sectors like what's Dr. Copper doing?"
"3651140","3652860"," What's financials doing?"
"3653780","3654760"," What's Excel you doing?"
"3655060","3655940"," Just briefly go briefly. "
"3656240","3658960"," Like maybe a five minute segment that goes bam, bam, bam, bam."
"3659420","3660720"," Let's take a peek at all the sectors."
"3660720","3662340"," Maybe even a rotation check. "
"3663660","3667680"," I could do that too where we do a quick check just to see if there's any rotation going on."
"3668080","3669760"," Maybe a market breath at the same time."
"3670000","3670140"," Hold on. "
"3670280","3670780"," Sector rotation."
"3676150","3677450"," Seeing an early risk."
"3677530","3679370"," And market breath. "
"3679650","3682430"," Comps index minus nine minus nine."
"3683050","3684710"," Lower than forecast minus three."
"3696060","3697700"," Option trade idea. "
"3701100","3703960"," The next thing we should do if you want."
"3704140","3710800"," Do you want to check a seasonality calendar every day and see if we're in line or not in line?"
"3711400","3717140"," I could add that to the market breath in the morning."
"3717240","3718000"," We put that on there. "
"3718880","3719400"," Check."
"3719640","3720740"," Check seasonality."
"3722160","3728990"," All right. "
"3729470","3730390"," Check seasonality."
"3731130","3740720"," And then I was going to do another one where throughout the"
"3740720","3741220"," day."
"3742560","3743460"," Let's say. "
"3747300","3748680"," Either a screener."
"3748980","3750180"," I can either do a screener."
"3751240","3756160"," Do you guys want a screener of call and put buying and selling. "
"3757280","3759260"," On the on the show every day."
"3760060","3764520"," I could leave a chart or I could put it in rotation if you wanted."
"3764840","3766180"," So you see down below here. "
"3767300","3772500"," Where I've got the charts going or moving from one chart to the next chart."
"3773080","3774700"," Do you guys want me to cycle in."
"3777460","3779080"," Call and put buying chart. "
"3779440","3785000"," I have access to it to a screener that shows call and put buying in real time."
"3785000","3791160"," It's not the spot gamma stuff the hero indicator, but it's just a chart that actually a graph chart"
"3791160","3795660"," that shows the rise and fall of call and put buying."
"3798040","3800300"," Call and put screener added into the rotation. "
"3800520","3800940"," Okay, hold on."
"3813520","3820180"," And the last one that I have here is an option trade idea every day."
"3821000","3823660"," If if one presents itself. "
"3824460","3826420"," Sometimes I do that, but I don't do it consistently."
"3827540","3829760"," But I would consistently every day check."
"3830040","3832060"," Hey, is there an option trade that we can play?"
"3832200","3833060"," It could be anything. "
"3833740","3836140"," Call spread put spread calendar spread."
"3836680","3839800"," It could be flies, condors."
"3839840","3842260"," It could be anything at all. "
"3843580","3845440"," But an option type set up."
"3853960","3856120"," Well, I'm missing some of you guys are saying here."
"3856400","3859920"," Someone said that track sits like the unusual wheels. "
"3860340","3864920"," So I don't know anything about the unusual wheels indicator other than what trader podcast said."
"3865620","3870420"," I just know that you can I have a way to track call and put buying and selling all day"
"3870420","3871260"," long."
"3878990","3881030"," Shaq Baker saying Google just went nuts. "
"3882490","3884990"," As a matter of fact, I just had a conversation this morning about Google."
"3884990","3886290"," Let's check out Google really quick."
"3897740","3899140"," Google squeezing right now. "
"3902760","3903540"," Frank and baby."
"3904660","3907060"," I got Google up right now in the bottom chart here."
"3907520","3908540"," Oh shit, I'm on the wrong one. "
"3912220","3913920"," I got Google up right here right now."
"3914200","3916800"," Google had a nice back check on their one hour trigger here."
"3917540","3918920"," Squeezing higher right now trading 153. "
"3920080","3920980"," Want to see it real quick."
"3921520","3922760"," That this is Google right here."
"3924480","3926020"," Nice but successful back. "
"3926140","3926640"," Back here."
"3926720","3931560"," Very bullish city fed manufacturing minus 17 minus 17."
"3931920","3933300"," Another early release. "
"3962840","3964600"," Thanks for the heads up on a good."
"3971110","3972490"," You read what you guys are saying."
"3973970","3977270"," Uh, types of option trades like spreads and such. "
"3977470","3979330"," Yeah, I think that is going to be a part of the."
"3979330","3981950"," I think that would be a part of the."
"3987660","3990620"," Trading concepts markets 101 segment. "
"3992760","3996360"," Like the explanation explaining the mechanics of trades and stuff like that."
"3996360","3998640"," This would be an actual trade where I set it up with you."
"3999120","4000840"," Okay, let's go trip set up a trade. "

"4112080","4115300"," And a note here too that interview thing that I talked to you about earlier."
"4116380","4121020"," We would give some of those slots away to people in the network."
"4121840","4126040"," So like if David AMS wanted to come on once a week or a trader podcast wanted to come on"
"4126040","4126460"," once a week. "
"4127080","4128399"," John L whoever it is."
"4128840","4130540"," They would be afforded those slots first."
"4131580","4133000"," So I could have a segment like. "
"4133720","4138359"," I don't know David AMS comes on that does something about his system or does something about his"
"4138359","4139779"," expectations for the week or whatever."

"4162160","4164520"," Maybe Chase will be I talked to Chase once about this."
"4165680","4168359"," You want to do a bear report once a week."

"4173120","4173899"," I'll write that down."
"4174040","4174240"," Hold on."
"4174300","4175180"," I'll write down some stuff here. "
"4176200","4177420"," Let me write down some other ideas."
"4178479","4179899"," Chase with a bear report."
"4181260","4181960"," I like that. "
"4187890","4189910"," I've talked to Chase about this in the past."
"4189930","4194390"," Chase coming on and doing giving a weekly a weekly report."
"4194390","4197570"," Would you want Chase to come on maybe on Mondays or Tuesdays or something. "

"4219080","4221360"," Hold on. "
"4221580","4223120"," I'll give you guys something here."
"4223240","4223860"," Give me one quick second."
"4229940","4232840"," I'm going to give you guys a market brief really quick. "
"4232840","4233160"," Okay."
"4234940","4237580"," SPX is marching towards the call wall at 4,900."
"4238440","4242420"," And is unlike yesterday supported by dropping yields. "
"4243500","4247240"," Two years minus 6.2 BPS 10 year minus 5 BPS."
"4248360","4250700"," And falling rate like expectations."
"4252040","4253880"," The rally is pretty broad base. "
"4254140","4261520"," SPX equal weight plus 8% point 8% and boosted by the momentum space of 0.6% positive."
"4261520","4265320"," So in general the chance to break higher or slightly higher this time around."
"4266420","4269780"," Given the extreme amount of tier one data coming up next week. "
"4269780","4276520"," However, we think 4,900 will stand this test and remain intact as a resistance in level."
"4277780","4279920"," Now we're not we're pretty weak right now."
"4279980","4280120"," Right. "
"4280340","4281280"," Well, I'm reading this to you."
"4281840","4287560"," We keep monitoring the situation in the Red Sea as tensions there are increasingly increasingly not"
"4287560","4291500"," decreasing as expressed by WTI climbing to the highest level."
"4291500","4292820"," Since early December. "
"4305800","4308460"," Read anything else to you this morning, but I don't see anything."
"4310680","4312100"," What else do you guys have for?"
"4312940","4314220"," What do you guys have for?"
"4315100","4317920"," What do you guys have for me for segments?"
"4318980","4325200"," Something once a week, once a month, once a quarter, once a day, anything you have right now, this"
"4325200","4325980"," is the time of the area."
"4326380","4328660"," So if you got something you want to add, this is the time to do it. "
"4332650","4335690"," Oh, Chase, dude, I was just I was just fucking with you, Chase."
"4336310","4337150"," I got you, brother."

"4359720","4360620"," Individual ticker time."
"4362440","4370960"," Yes, I think that's included in one of them."
"4372460","4373660"," I don't. "
"4373800","4376180"," I need more information on that, Mr. Talking Monk."
"4376320","4377600"," I don't understand exactly what you mean."
"4380280","4381700"," Somewhere cloud on. "
"4382360","4382800"," Oh, God."
"4391540","4395820"," A good lot of a hold until the next trading day."
"4397520","4398880"," I'll put me put this in. "
"4399900","4401180"," Do you guys want?"
"4401460","4402620"," Oh, I didn't say this."
"4405600","4408200"," Get back into expectations for following day."
"4417200","4418880"," Following day and week. "
"4423260","4425140"," So at the end of the show, right, 345."
"4426760","4430180"," I used to do a segment where I would have a Webull chart up."
"4430680","4435880"," And I would show like my weekly expectation and then like what I expect into tomorrow, that kind of"
"4435880","4436080"," stuff. "
"4436080","4438980"," We could put that back in on 345 in the afternoon or something."
"4440020","4441200"," Three o'clock in the afternoon."
"4442580","4445160"," Expectations for following day week at 345 or something. "
"4447060","4449080"," At 345 in the afternoon."
"4452980","4453960"," No, no, no."
"4461650","4462410"," That's a good one. "
"4462590","4462970"," That's a good one."
"4463010","4463490"," I like that one."
"4468120","4469520"," We Oh, JPM car update. "
"4469840","4470080"," All right."
"4470220","4470880"," I'll put that at the top."
"4471060","4471360"," Hold on here. "
"4471440","4472240"," JPM caller update."
"4472420","4472720"," Good job."
"4472720","4473860"," I like that one. "
"4474360","4476220"," I'll do that every morning during the brief."
"4478300","4479100"," JPM caller."
"4479360","4479700"," Good one. "
"4483680","4485200"," You know what else we should do."
"4486600","4491060"," Is we should do you guys are all getting access to this stuff in the first, right?"
"4492060","4494460"," Do you guys want to do a segment where."
"4495680","4499080"," So what are the coolest things that is going to take place here?"
"4499300","4500820"," We got a really cool thing that's happening here. "
"4501580","4507200"," So you figure on on July or I see February 1st, right?"
"4509980","4512020"," What looks so for the sign up."
"4512040","4513200"," So we have right now."
"4513840","4516560"," We have about 1000 people signing up. "
"4517420","4518560"," On the first."
"4520720","4522980"," You're going to have about 1000 people."
"4523900","4526900"," That may not be looking at what I'm looking at. "
"4526900","4529440"," So like I like to look at spy, right?"
"4529920","4531020"," All I watch is spy."
"4531300","4532380"," I watch other things, but."
"4533100","4535640"," I fucking watch by all day long. "
"4536420","4536600"," Uh."
"4538220","4539800"," Uh, Tesla will."
"4540560","4541880"," You guys know him, right?"
"4542640","4544300"," He watches Tesla all day long. "
"4545060","4552620"," One of you might watch oil all day long or might watch a palette palette tier all day long."
"4553160","4554740"," Uh, Nino, California."
"4555200","4556180"," What does he watch all day long?"
"4556480","4557360"," You guys know what he watches?"
"4557700","4559700"," Nino, if you're out there, what do you watch all day long?"
"4559960","4561100"," What's your favorite ticker?"
"4561180","4561440"," Tell me. "
"4562180","4563740"," You say it every day and it's in the stream."
"4565620","4568600"," So Nino has his favorite ticker he watches every day."
"4571300","4572220"," Rivian, exactly. "
"4574420","4581160"," We're going to be crowdsourcing these triggers and velocity on a scale."
"4582520","4583520"," That's kind of insane."
"4585400","4589720"," So maybe we should do a segment where we were maybe you guys. "
"4590060","4593180"," We look for your input on what you're watching."
"4593740","4594680"," Like a cap."
"4594980","4598600"," Uh, my favorite ticker has got six trigger cluster bear cluster. "
"4599460","4601900"," Uh, coming down, raining down on top of it."
"4602400","4604560"," We should pay attention to that to short it."
"4605200","4605840"," Hey, cap. "
"4606060","4606980"," We've got an eight trigger cluster."
"4607780","4610180"," Bull cluster momentum coming up in the stock."
"4610400","4611940"," It's been down for like the last 10 years. "
"4612520","4613620"," My favorite ticker, bro."
"4613820","4615580"," I've been upside down in it forever and ever and ever."
"4616620","4617940"," So maybe crowdsourcing. "
"4619740","4620540"," Crowdsourcing segment."
"4633730","4634950"," Uh, we'll do clusters."
"4642590","4645290"," So, so we'll do is once a week, we'll ask. "
"4645750","4646810"," Um, once we glass."
"4647670","4652530"," Does any of the audience have a six or eight trigger cluster that they want us to look at?"
"4653110","4653790"," How about that?"
"4653790","4655670"," And if we have none, we got none."
"4655790","4657950"," If we've got like someone's like, dude, we got an eight trigger cluster. "
"4658150","4660030"," One of my favorite, my favorite tickers out there."
"4660450","4661570"," We'll look at that ticker."
"4665400","4669000"," King Kyle saying we got no, no new lows in one minute bull cross forming right now. "
"4670620","4671900"," Heads up on spoos."
"4677360","4678360"," Roger that Stacey."
"4678360","4678860"," I got you. "
"4684240","4686600"," Is there an appropriate time for some bear jams?"
"4690660","4693520"," Let's look at, uh, take a look here."
"4694520","4698500"," Yeah, I see the, so I want to show you guys something here."
"4698660","4698820"," Okay. "
"4699960","4702140"," Um, I am with you on the bear jams."
"4703160","4705040"," I'm going to point something out here really quick."
"4705040","4706600"," Just as a market awareness. "
"4706720","4707160"," Okay."
"4708560","4710300"," Uh, I'm going to show you guys some market awareness here."
"4710300","4710600"," Okay. "
"4711300","4713100"," You have a bear cross."
"4714300","4715020"," Right here."
"4721180","4722580"," There's a bear plane right here. "
"4722660","4722960"," You see it?"
"4722960","4728180"," Get some downside movement."
"4730600","4731120"," Right."
"4732020","4739960"," A little bit of a bull cross right here, but the scary thing is the second bear cross. "
"4740160","4740720"," You have consolidation."
"4742700","4743840"," Quick squeeze up."
"4745380","4747960"," And this actually looks like a bear cross, doesn't it?"
"4748380","4753920"," When you do the double bear, the double bear plane, they can usually be explosive downside moves. "
"4755660","4758600"," Uh, now this took place, uh, yesterday."
"4760740","4764100"," Uh, and this one right now taking place right here, right?"
"4764620","4771240"," So I'd be paying attention to someone saying it should be looking for a double bear cross or not."
"4771240","4777480"," Now, another way you can interpret this would be, uh, is this a bull confirmation on the hourly"
"4777480","4778160"," trigger, right?"
"4778300","4781800"," We come down, test the hourly trigger on a three hour look back. "
"4782560","4787100"," It looks actually pretty bullish on a three hour look back, right?"
"4787240","4787720"," We tested it."
"4787800","4788400"," We didn't break it."
"4788460","4790980"," We didn't get underneath it and start to reject it yet, have we?"
"4792700","4797180"," Uh, so if you break the hourly trigger, you begin to reject the hourly trigger. "
"4797420","4798640"," That's a bearish outcome, right?"
"4799580","4804860"," Uh, but right here, right now we tested this successfully, the hourly trigger and we're going to"
"4804860","4807000"," find out which where we were, we are going."
"4807000","4814080"," So let's take a look now on spy in a 30 minute basis and see what we can tell from"
"4814080","4814480"," velocity."
"4819490","4823050"," And what can we tell our glean from velocity here?"
"4823750","4830290"," We can see that daily velocity is experiencing new lows. "
"4830650","4831190"," That's not good."
"4832110","4839810"," And we're experiencing lower highs on daily velocity as well on the hourly trigger."
"4840790","4842510"," Now, so we're kind of bearish here. "
"4843130","4845550"," Not completely bearish, but kind of bearish here."
"4846110","4849790"," And I want to show you how this translate translates right here."
"4854890","4856570"," It kind of looks like this, right?"
"4857750","4860270"," Get that declining, get that declining right here. "
"4861130","4865870"," Give a little bit of a bearish divergence here right now, don't we?"
"4867250","4868890"," Uh, forming right now above."
"4869610","4869930"," You see that?"
"4870550","4873930"," Get there right there and some of that right there and some of that right there."
"4873970","4874330"," You see it?"
"4877610","4879010"," So that's kind of bearish. "
"4879190","4888110"," And I like watching the 30 minutes more so than I like watching the one minute for direction's"
"4888110","4888310"," sake."
"4888650","4890130"," We have a nice little squeeze right here, right?"
"4891530","4894950"," A nice little squeeze, nice little pullback, nice little squeeze."
"4895710","4899130"," I'm not guaranteed here, but maybe we have a pullback coming up. "
"4901010","4903010"," So we're going to get back to the one minute chart here."
"4909630","4911730"," A little bit of bearish diversions, right?"
"4914530","4919570"," Someone telling me to be careful in the chat as well."
"4922920","4928600"," Now on book map, we've got the big fat red bar down there telling you, but wait, there's more. "
"4928600","4936480"," And we also have, we're kind of in the middle here of the middle here of SPX."
"4936700","4937600"," We looked down below the gamma."
"4937880","4939620"," We had a nice successful bounce down here. "
"4939680","4940380"," That looks kind of bullish."
"4941280","4942160"," Not so much bearish."
"4943220","4944960"," It's but to be careful here, right?"
"4945480","4950180"," So we have a potential bull cross right here. "
"4951060","4953800"," I also read to you the pin the 4900."
"4954280","4955840"," We know that today is Thursday."
"4956560","4960220"," And we know that they're monetizing the week here. "
"4960880","4968020"," Expectation for the rest of today for Thursday in my viewpoint is going to be slamming into that"
"4968020","4976080"," 4900 slamming into that 4900 slamming into that 4900 until the end of the day."
"4976540","4982500"," And likely into the open tomorrow and then a roll down into Friday close."
"4983780","4986700"," So I'm not as bearish here as it might seem. "
"4987820","4993960"," So if I was looking at this here, I would be looking for a place to maybe put a put"
"4993960","5000640"," spread on into Friday close or Monday and then monetize it on Friday to the downside on a high."
"5003320","5007500"," And you can see above, we've got some supply way higher."
"5009460","5013360"," So I'm kind of bullish on the short term here. "
"5015620","5016700"," Here's our three."
"5017420","5018460"," I'm bullish here."
"5019060","5021820"," I'm bullish tentatively unless we have a break below this cross. "
"5022940","5024320"," This cross right here."
"5024780","5033320"," I'm tentatively bullish into the close today to possibly 491, 71, 490, 24 on spy."
"5034040","5038780"," But looking for an opportunity to short into Friday close. "
"5039460","5042720"," If that makes any difference or Monday, Monday, something like that."

"5088520","5089500"," Yeah, I think we've had."
"5090280","5095460"," I think that I think the catalyst here is going to be Visa and I and TC."

"5098300","5100100"," I will actually post a."

"5167320","5171220"," No, no, no. "
"5193840","5206700"," I think we're locked"
"5206700","5207240"," in here."
"5207520","5212160"," I think that we're they were locked into those two reports and then the market has a brief moments"
"5212160","5213180"," on clenching of Friday."
"5214980","5219560"," There's no, there's no like major reports on Friday and then we're like, we have a, like, a window"
"5219560","5221100"," between Friday and to Monday. "
"5250270","5250830"," Okay."
"5251350","5252010"," All right."
"5252010","5254730"," So I went over this morning. "
"5254770","5257950"," We went over some changes that are coming on February 1st."
"5258110","5259830"," We're going to introduce segments to the show."
"5260730","5265170"," When we introduce these segments to the show, I've got took your ideas for what to, what was"
"5265170","5266450"," segments to include in the show. "
"5267070","5272770"," What we're going to do is you'll see a screener come up when we make these segments."
"5273570","5276690"," They'll be defined like, Hey, we're going to do market brief."
"5278110","5279110"," Hey, we're going to do. "
"5281250","5283530"," We're going to do a T3 tool."
"5285450","5287310"," Education in a moment."
"5288190","5293510"," Then we're going to focus on some specific item and make the show more consistent so that you can"
"5293510","5297170"," have a know what to expect throughout the day. "
"5299190","5300090"," What else we got here?"
"5303150","5303890"," That's all I got."
"5304050","5305310"," That's all I think that's all I got right now."
"5305310","5305790"," Okay. "
"5306290","5310210"," So from this moment forward, I'm going to go back to what I was doing."
"5310210","5312250"," I have to remove myself from the stream right now."
"5312270","5313470"," I'll still be here in the office. "
"5314130","5315870"," I have working on discord in the background."
"5316510","5317750"," I have a question about discord."
"5318070","5323590"," If any of you out there are watching the show right now and you have experience, you're like a"
"5323590","5324190"," discord. "
"5326170","5328010"," You're like a discord guru."
"5328690","5331330"," You know everything about, I mean everything about discord."
"5332430","5336710"," If you know everything about discord and you I have a bunch of questions. "
"5336770","5337830"," If you have any time available."
"5338470","5344830"," I need someone with some dis I used to have a lot of discord experience, but I don't have as"
"5344830","5345650"," much as I used to."
"5346170","5349210"," And so I'm not as good as it as added as it was was. "
"5349610","5350770"," I just have a bunch of questions."
"5351030","5355050"," So if you're watching the show right now and you have any experience with discord, if you could DM"
"5355050","5356610"," me on Twitter, I would appreciate it."
"5363850","5365810"," I'm doing some work on it. "
"5367010","5368430"," I'm not doing it correctly."
"5369550","5373450"," I think I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm doing it wrong."
"5374350","5376050"," Or the slow way or something. "
"5380480","5384620"," I can't see what what's cap what you're taking the fed by the dip or whatever announcements."
"5385700","5387260"," Did you see that post that I made about it?"
"5387260","5388480"," This morning chase."
"5392080","5393720"," Did you see my post this morning brother?"
"5393980","5394380"," I made a post. "
"5395040","5395940"," I think it's Wolf Street."
"5396340","5397440"," How to take on it."
"5397540","5398140"," I like that take. "
"5399700","5404900"," So if you just check my post history on Twitter, I made a post by last post this morning outside"
"5404900","5408300"," of the outside of the show."
"5408860","5413580"," Also, I'm going to chart out for you while I'm working on the discord crap."
"5413580","5415660"," I am going to chart out for you guys. "
"5418440","5420280"," I'm going to chart out for you guys."
"5420700","5426000"," I'm going to chart out Visa and I NTC."
"5427220","5431160"," Both the expected move and the pivot points for them. "
"5431780","5433600"," So you'll see me working on that in the background."
"5439290","5440190"," All right, I'll be back."
"5441830","5443290"," I'm going to turn on CNBC on. "
"5443430","5444850"," Oh, do you guys ever want to see the actual?"
"5445290","5445910"," Do you got?"
"5446630","5447670"," I'm going to tell you guys."
"5447770","5448630"," Oh, there's a couple of shit."
"5448750","5449490"," I'm going to write this in here. "
"5452450","5455490"," There's a couple other programming notes with the new show."
"5459510","5461430"," You're going to see an icon come up."
"5462310","5463990"," There's two points about the show. "
"5466630","5471190"," Currently, when I'm not on the show, I play in the background, the audio from CNBC."
"5472910","5475130"," Do you guys want to see the video from CNBC?"
"5476610","5477390"," Yes or no?"
"5477590","5481170"," Do you want to see the video as well if I'm not here on the on your screen?"
"5482310","5483130"," Yes or no?"
"5483710","5484930"," Or is just the audio enough?"
"5485170","5486870"," Now, I know some of you don't like the audio."
"5487890","5489450"," So we're going to fix that. "
"5489870","5494210"," What I'm going to do here is when I'm not on the show, I'm going to put CNBC on either"
"5494210","5496490"," the audio or the audio in the video."
"5498110","5505090"," Now, if it's a day where I'm not currently with you, like right here right now with video and audio"
"5505090","5513530"," from my voice, I'm going to put an icon that flashes on the screen saying, Hey caps here in case"
"5513530","5516530"," you mute the broadcast so you don't have to listen to CNBC."
"5517730","5521710"," So if you're like muting the broadcast, you're just watching the TV screen or whatever. "
"5521710","5524670"," And you're like, Oh, shit, cap speaking."
"5525290","5528910"," You'll see an icon saying, Hey caps live talking right now."
"5529490","5532710"," So you can then like turn the show back up and listen to me talk if you want. "
"5537550","5538970"," I agree with that man, Vera."
"5539210","5541990"," We're going to solve that on February one."
"5542170","5542950"," We're going to solve that. "
"5543550","5549350"," So if you don't like the CNBC audio, you'll see something flashing saying captains back on again."
"5550070","5554450"," Maybe I could do the icon to say CNBC audio and then cap audio."
"5563110","5563890"," I'll do that. "
"5564270","5567250"," So that you'll know if it's CNBC audio or cap audio."
"5569270","5571350"," So Biden plans to send CIA."
"5571650","5571930"," That's right. "
"5572210","5577870"," So the idea here would be if you're at home and you don't like CNBC speaking, you just mute it."
"5578850","5582510"," And then if you're watching the stream with the mute on and you're listening to your own audio"
"5582510","5587190"," somewhere else and you see a specific icon pop up, it'll say cap speaking."
"5590420","5591800"," Yeah, on air, right?"
"5592120","5592420"," Absolutely. "
"5597060","5597560"," Okay."
"5598920","5599900"," What's going on, AJ?"
"5600120","5600820"," I mean, how are you doing, brother?"
"5601000","5601440"," Good to see you, man."
"5603720","5606140"," Am I allowed to show CNBC live?"
"5606420","5608880"," I know there's a famous streamer that does. "
"5610200","5612000"," He does show the show live."
"5612420","5613680"," I don't think CNBC cares."
"5615300","5616040"," I'll be honest. "
"5616240","5616880"," I don't think that they care."
"5618600","5621140"," If they, if I get demonetized, we'll stop it."
"5621920","5623780"," We won't do it if I get demonetized. "
"5631110","5633610"," Put bliss, we could put bliss, so it's on."
"5634430","5636110"," And here's the last thing to you."
"5636650","5637210"," That's a good. "
"5637350","5637970"," That's a good comment."
"5638170","5638830"," Who wrote that comment?"
"5638950","5639350"," Rocket surgeon."
"5640190","5643570"," Just said, put bliss, so it's on for a good color for commentary. "
"5644530","5645890"," Here's another question for you."
"5647030","5652310"," If any of you are ever interested in being a guest host on the stream, let me know."
"5652930","5654890"," Reach out to me via DM on Twitter. "
"5655790","5659730"," If you're like, hey, Cap, I've always wanted to live stream or something like that or be a stand"
"5659730","5660050"," in."
"5660770","5662390"," Or I think people want to hear my voice."
"5663010","5664710"," Always feel free to reach out. "
"5665530","5669550"," If you ever want to host the stream, if I'm unavailable, let me know."
"5670430","5671210"," I can get you."
"5672410","5678370"," I can send you a copy of Streamlabs that's all set up and ready to go and you can run"
"5678370","5679230"," the stream from your house. "
"5680170","5682770"," If I know, and I have to know you, you can't be somebody that don't know."
"5683030","5684450"," You have to be like a guy like Blissowitz."
"5684610","5685950"," Guy's been around here since day one. "
"5687350","5688070"," I'm sorry."
"5688250","5689790"," If I don't know you, I'd have to get to know you."
"5689910","5694350"," Or if you have a history on Twitter, like a 10 year, five year history on Twitter that I can"
"5694350","5698390"," track you down and make sure that you're who you say you are, that would be possible as well. "
"5698390","5701450"," I'd have to find out some kind of bona fides from you that I trust you."
"5703110","5706970"," As a person too, not really trust you like, oh, are they perfect?"
"5707690","5708870"," And remember something too."
"5709410","5716250"," If you were a stand in for me, I have no expectations that you're like calling shots or you have"
"5716250","5716810"," to be right. "
"5717750","5721690"," It's more just just trying to host the show and be like, hey, how's everybody doing?"
"5722230","5723090"," Everybody happy here?"
"5723210","5723890"," What can I help you with?"
"5724090","5724550"," That kind of stuff."
"5724550","5730470"," So don't feel like you have to be like fucking no like pro trader level fucking 30 or something."
"5731310","5732610"," It doesn't have to be like that. "
"5738310","5742190"," Yeah, it would be cool to have an interactive stream where everybody can choose their own audio."
"5742710","5742950"," I would."
"5743470","5748510"," I think the only solution I can think of right now would be to where you can choose to mute"
"5748510","5751050"," it and then unmute it based upon something visual. "
"5751930","5753290"," That's all I can think of right now."
"5760370","5764790"," If it's goes live, I'm going to see how quickly I can piss him off by going Max left is."
"5767890","5768530"," That's hilarious. "
"5769670","5771570"," I really appreciate you guys being."
"5772970","5778070"," Civil to each other too, especially with the mixing of politics with stock market stuff."
"5778290","5779110"," I really appreciate that. "
"5779790","5782830"," And knowing when it matters and when it doesn't matter and all that kind of stuff."
"5783370","5784730"," So when it doesn't matter to market moves."
"5787780","5791680"," Why would you want to stream audio when I'm not here?"
"5792680","5793820"," Dead air space. "
"5794900","5796180"," Absolutely dead air space."
"5796740","5797700"," It's a proven fact."
"5798340","5802920"," You got to have something to fill that dead air space and market breaking news that kind of stuff. "
"5803320","5804680"," Market starts slamming down."
"5805400","5807360"," You want to know why some people want to know why."
"5817460","5819380"," Yeah, I appreciate the politics stuff. "
"5819540","5823920"," I appreciate you guys are civil and that you most we don't really talk a lot of politics here that"
"5823920","5824740"," are not market related."
"5825100","5826200"," Every once in a while we do."
"5826480","5830100"," We did I think yesterday before and I was really appreciative that it didn't evolve into something"
"5830100","5830600"," nasty. "
"5831860","5833900"," Because we don't normally talk about that stuff."
"5834120","5836720"," We don't want to talk only politics as it relates to the market."
"5836720","5843300"," So I want to just extend that appreciation to all of you as a community that we don't devolve into"
"5843300","5843680"," that here. "
"5848910","5850110"," Yeah, dead air is rough."
"5850290","5851610"," You have to have a little something going on."
"5851910","5854870"," The point there too is if you don't like CNBC. "
"5856190","5859070"," It's easy for you to just mute and listen to something else."
"5859370","5861930"," Put some jams on at home or put on Bloomberg news."
"5862570","5863850"," I used to do Bloomberg news. "
"5864810","5867990"," But Bloomberg news are new Bloomberg financial news used to be great."
"5868810","5874230"," And then slowly over time they were like let's just throw in some shit right now that has fucking"
"5874230","5877330"," zero to do with the stock market."
"5877610","5880430"," And it was often very biased one way or the other. "
"5880510","5881010"," It didn't matter."
"5881190","5883690"," It was just really like piss people off."
"5883910","5884510"," So I'm just like fuck. "
"5884650","5885470"," No, we ain't doing that."
"5885910","5891850"," CNBC does that sometimes like you show up in the morning in CNBC like 4 a.m. And I forget"
"5891850","5892470"," his name now."
"5892590","5896010"," I don't I forget his name on top of head with that one old guy like that fucking guy just"
"5896010","5898990"," goes up and tangents and the other guys like go fuck yourself. "
"5899530","5900450"," The skinny guy."
"5900590","5909320"," I forget the names, but I might be able to do that."
"5910280","5912920"," So Bork is working on for us. "
"5913940","5915500"," Giving you guys control."
"5916020","5917040"," That's not done yet."
"5917200","5920980"," He's got a lot of he's so a couple things here some programming notes. "
"5920980","5923140"," Bork is on vacation right now."
"5924320","5931700"," He's also working on some he's working on some API stuff."
"5932740","5940260"," To tie you guys in to be able to chat on the streams via membership through us instead of through"
"5940260","5947360"," through a Twitch or YouTube, which is complicated and time consuming. "
"5949160","5951880"," So you go through us for chat."
"5952860","5956940"," The ability to chat rather than those systems."
"5958380","5961000"," Now on his plate right now. "
"5961780","5965840"," He also was working on you guys controlling a bunch of shit."
"5966640","5970080"," So I will write that down for Bork."
"5972400","5974480"," You guys controlling the audio. "
"5977680","5979740"," And he's already discussed that with me."
"5980200","5984700"," So what's really cool is you guys are going to be able to at some point soon."
"5986100","5988920"," Turn on bear music turn on bull music. "
"5989300","5991700"," You could probably also turn on or off."
"5994100","5997960"," Audio like a CNBC audio when I will look into that."
"6000400","6003820"," Maybe there is a tool that from home you could turn it on or off. "
"6004360","6005120"," That would be cool."
"6006220","6007920"," So I'll ask him about that specifically."
"6008300","6009220"," Thanks for saying that big balls. "
"6010520","6011420"," Thank you big balls."
"6011540","6012320"," I appreciate that brother."
"6015440","6016380"," Yeah, I got your brother. "
"6016620","6017800"," I get what you're tracking."
"6018140","6020340"," Did you guys going to be able to turn on like the disco ball?"
"6020900","6022320"," I got disco lights here."
"6022340","6025500"," You guys are going to be able to turn on lighting in the office. "
"6026420","6028760"," You guys are going to be able to do a bunch of cool shit."
"6039930","6041270"," Oh, Tom Keens back on."
"6041530","6041910"," David A."
"6041910","6042270"," Messana. "
"6042490","6043530"," Tom Keens back on Bloomberg."
"6046250","6047870"," I will look into that right now, David."
"6047950","6048510"," I didn't know that. "
"6057500","6060040"," Is he on all day long, David, right now?"
"6060420","6065580"," And is he is he on the radio show or is he on his own channel on like a tune"
"6065580","6066200"," in or something?"
"6067340","6068060"," How are you?"
"6068280","6070040"," How are you accessing him right now, David?"
"6070400","6071780"," Two questions for you."
"6071900","6075340"," It's cover issue two spot eight, six, two spot eight, six."

"6289750","6292870"," Oh, I was, I was thinking about it from audio when I'm not here during the day."
"6293550","6294990"," Having some audio playing in the background. "
"6295770","6299590"," Do that, that, uh, that disco ball keeps spinning right now."

"6319680","6327380"," I guess so, I guess only the, um, I guess, I guess the only people voting on segments are hardcore"
"6327380","6329160"," community members. "
"6329560","6330760"," That's not a bad thing."
"6331360","6332980"," Uh, so good job."
"6333120","6333180"," Ready?"
"6334440","6339260"," Uh, if you're a hardcore member, we only got your input. "
"6340700","6341800"," Which is kind of cool."
"6343660","6347840"," Uh, because I never posted the stream this morning onto Twitter."
"6349880","6351280"," I have the post set up. "
"6351340","6352100"," I just never did it."
"6353520","6355860"," And I got something else cool for you guys this morning."
"6357360","6362140"," Today is, uh, Joe Donut's birthday. "
"6363660","6367440"," If you don't know it, you don't know who Joe Donut is."
"6368000","6383450"," Uh, if you don't know, did I just type in, uh, if,"
"6383610","6385190"," uh, if you don't know Joe Donut, it is."
"6386550","6388290"," Uh, he is my partner. "
"6388510","6389150"," He's one of my partners."
"6389510","6394830"," I have two partners here, uh, but my one, my main partner is Joe Donut."
"6395250","6396230"," Some of you know him. "
"6397470","6399010"," And, uh, some of you don't."
"6400130","6402110"," And it is his birthday today."
"6402830","6408050"," Uh, and I'm going to talk to you guys about how I met Joe Donut and, uh, why he's my"
"6408050","6408430"," partner. "
"6409210","6410290"," Um, he's a part."
"6410890","6412130"," Why is he not in here?"
"6413230","6414290"," This is so sketchy."
"6418530","6420850"," It's like I'm some on Twitter right now, right?"
"6422570","6424650"," And, uh, Joe Donut's not coming up. "
"6428190","6428850"," So bizarre."
"6428850","6434250"," Uh, we're going to talk about Joe Donut this morning."
"6434950","6438170"," So I met Joe Donut, uh, when I first got on Twitter. "
"6438790","6445290"," Uh, here's his, um, I'm going to show his, uh, I'm going to show Joey Donut right now."
"6445830","6446750"," This is his profile."
"6449090","6454550"," Uh, he's almost, oh, he's almost near his birth year. "
"6456670","6461550"," I'm not going to say when his birth year is, but, uh, he's been on Twitter since 2008."
"6463130","6464470"," He's an OG Twitter user."
"6465510","6468230"," Uh, shit shows his date right here, 1982. "
"6469390","6476690"," And he said to me, he said, he said, I wish I could be at 19, uh, 1982 followers to"
"6476690","6477470"," match my birthday."
"6478390","6480490"," Uh, so his birthday is this week."
"6481770","6483850"," And, uh, he's excited about it. "
"6485370","6488410"," And I met this guy because he is very pragmatic."
"6490370","6495010"," Uh, so an example would be Joe's a Tesla bull, but he's also pragmatic."
"6495670","6500570"," He's not just like blindly, uh, regurgitating as a Tesla bull. "
"6501650","6503350"," And, uh, I like that about him."
"6504370","6507910"," As a matter of fact, uh, he's going to fuck, he's in Tesla."
"6510990","6512210"," Post up right here. "
"6512350","6513490"," I'm going to like that post, by the way."
"6515370","6518270"," And, uh, he's got the Bucky's thing going on here."
"6520110","6521010"," Let us pray. "
"6522710","6526070"," Uh, what I really like about Joe donut though is his replies."
"6527490","6530250"," Uh, he's very thoughtful and his replies to people."
"6531730","6533550"," So I guess I'm on replies right now. "
"6534350","6539050"," And, uh, I always like his, his replies."
"6539050","6541150"," So here's Jedi, uh, Jedi Marcus post."
"6541810","6545310"," And, um, you'll see that he's either funny. "
"6546250","6548890"," Or he, or he's productive in conversation."
"6549630","6552450"," So if you ever have a chance, uh, follow Joe donut."
"6552690","6556350"," His handle is at Joe Harper. "
"6556970","6560050"," And the reason I became friends with him was because."
"6562090","6572980"," Uh, as I developed my relationship with him over the years, as a friend behind"
"6572980","6573720"," closed doors."
"6574060","6576100"," This is before we ever even started this. "
"6576340","6577260"," This was just us friends."
"6578540","6580440"," Uh, I'm from the west."
"6581380","6584000"," I'm from out west, the western United States. "
"6585420","6588340"," And, uh, I moved to Michigan."
"6590960","6592740"," And when I lived out west."
"6595180","6602920"," If I was in a room with two or three of my best friends and they were three white guys. "
"6604680","6606220"," It was not acceptable."
"6607340","6609700"," Uh, to say racist things."
"6610940","6613360"," It was not acceptable to disparage women. "
"6614540","6616020"," Uh, it was not acceptable."
"6618160","6622720"," And you would see in those closed rooms truly who somebody is."
"6622740","6627650"," Uh, as a human being. "
"6628830","6630850"," Now this does nothing to do with your politics."
"6631210","6632210"," Just you as a person."
"6634110","6636770"," You like one on one with other people. "
"6637430","6638490"," You know this, right?"
"6638630","6641830"," I know when you got, I know that you out there when you're with your friends or were you with"
"6641830","6642410"," your family."
"6643370","6645110"," That you see the true person."
"6647230","6648570"," When I moved to Michigan. "
"6651220","6652560"," I moved to Michigan, right?"
"6652560","6657840"," And for the first time in a very long time, I would be in closed rooms with people."
"6658040","6659560"," People that I'd met that were white people."
"6659880","6662100"," I heard really racist shit from now. "
"6662140","6667620"," This isn't all Michigan or all Detroit, but I did see that and witnessed that."
"6668060","6670020"," And I was deeply offended by that."
"6670600","6673960"," Uh, where you have a public face and then a private face. "
"6674560","6676640"," And the private face didn't match the public face."
"6678140","6680520"," Uh, that hurt me when I moved to Michigan."
"6680520","6684320"," So officials, the U.S. and Iraq are the shift to bilateral military relations. "
"6684740","6688460"," U.S. officials are to stay in Iraq to defeat the Islamic State."
"6688980","6692000"," A new arrangement to replace multilateral defense according to a U.S. official."
"6693160","6695540"," So when I lived out West, I had friends that were Republicans. "
"6696100","6698640"," I had friends that were Democrats and a lot of friends that were libertarians."
"6699780","6703100"," Uh, but behind a closed door, they weren't fucking racists."
"6703860","6704580"," They weren't sexist. "
"6705600","6707160"," They weren't any of the bad shit."
"6707800","6709760"," Now they might be slightly racist and not know it."
"6709760","6712400"," They might be slightly, uh, this or that. "
"6713040","6714340"," People are like that, right?"
"6715040","6715820"," I get that."
"6716580","6719640"," But not just like abject something really terrible."
"6720800","6723460"," Uh, terrible human being behind closed doors. "
"6724300","6725260"," I moved to Michigan."
"6725380","6726360"," I encountered some of that."
"6727120","6728580"," Um, and I encountered some of that. "
"6728700","6731700"," I encountered some of that from my friends here that are African-American."
"6731980","6733760"," About white people behind closed doors that are my friends."
"6734480","6738240"," Um, but I've not, it was glaring for me when I moved to Michigan. "
"6738240","6742040"," I mean, it was more common for me when I moved to Michigan."
"6742320","6744820"," Now Joe Donut, I became friends with him."
"6744900","6748020"," And behind closed doors, that guy is who he is in real life. "
"6749080","6750320"," He's a good man in real life."
"6750840","6754500"," Uh, he's a great husband, great father, um, to his children."
"6755620","6757180"," And he lives who he is. "
"6757740","6761300"," I've never seen him or experienced him not be that person."
"6761880","6764680"," Uh, so I, I grew close to Joe."
"6764780","6767340"," Joe, I was attracted to Joe as a person. "
"6768900","6771200"," And, uh, we became close friends."
"6772400","6776560"," And, uh, I'd count him as amongst, uh, one of my best friends out there in real life."
"6777000","6780920"," I only have a few, uh, real life friends that I'm close with. "
"6781160","6784020"," And this guy, Joe Donut, uh, has become one of them."
"6784740","6791540"," Now, I'll call myself when I, I'll, I'll, I'll call him one of my friends for life, uh, due to"
"6791540","6791740"," that."
"6792300","6798160"," I know that no matter what in any situation that guy will be there, uh, as a loyal, trusted friend. "
"6798860","6804980"," Uh, for the right reasons, even when things are going wrong, uh, even when things are bad, even"
"6804980","6807140"," when things are good, uh, it doesn't matter."
"6807780","6811080"," Uh, and I can trust and value his, uh, decision making."
"6811720","6817780"," Uh, and I asked him to be my partner, uh, to keep me in line two. "
"6818460","6822720"," Uh, because I said to him, you know, uh, I know that a lot of times when you go down"
"6822720","6825200"," these roads, uh, you can become greedy."
"6825740","6827780"," Uh, you can become focused on money."
"6828060","6830200"," You can become focused on becoming a furu. "
"6830500","6835660"," Uh, you can be trying to fuck people or only say what, uh, plays on their emotions."
"6836480","6839960"," Uh, there's a lot of, uh, evil shit that goes on in the background of these things."
"6840220","6842400"," We can pump and dump stock tickers. "
"6842400","6847820"," We can create a discord where, um, we're doing pump and dump operations."
"6848680","6853500"," You can see people just greed, uh, just like greed, you know, evil shit."
"6853500","6856240"," Uh, or I don't like that person. "
"6856820","6858520"," Uh, we're going to fuck with them, that kind of stuff."
"6858900","6864600"," All that nasty evil shit that people thrive on, there are people, real people in the world."
"6865000","6872060"," You may not know this that, uh, don't give a fine fuck about their common man, uh, their common"
"6872060","6872420"," woman. "
"6872860","6877360"," Um, or people that, uh, thrive on being nasty and mean."
"6878080","6878820"," He's not that guy."
"6879700","6881780"," Uh, he's always looking for the positive. "
"6881780","6883460"," He's always looking for the right thing to do."
"6884040","6888840"," He knows that, uh, good things come to people, uh, that, uh, do those things."
"6889560","6895240"," And he knows that when something bad comes to people that do good things, uh, that, uh, other"
"6895240","6897300"," people will be there for them when those bad things come. "
"6897880","6900140"," That's another important part of life."
"6900760","6904800"," If you live a good life, uh, over time, better things come to you."
"6905160","6911020"," And when something tragic comes to you, living a good life, uh, people that you are around like him"
"6911020","6912720"," are there for you to pick you up. "
"6913760","6917240"," Uh, so if you have a chance, uh, it's his birthday coming up this week."
"6918080","6919720"," Uh, follow Joe Donut."
"6920360","6924960"," I think he'll be a light on the hill for you, uh, on your, in your Twitter experience. "
"6929960","6931720"," Okay, that's Joe Donut."
"6941210","6942310"," It's happy birthday, Joe."
"6949390","6950670"," No boy, Joey Donut. "
"6951250","6954330"," Uh, and he gets buried up too."
"6954710","6958250"," Uh, if you're a bear out there, right, you're like, um, I'm an angry person."
"6958690","6961970"," Uh, Joe Donut buys puts, Joe Donut short stocks. "
"6962870","6964530"," So he's very pragmatic."
"6964530","6965970"," Remember that pragmatism."
"6966790","6968430"," Uh, so follow Joe Donut. "
"6972720","6973480"," All right."
"6973840","6974940"," Uh, that's what I got for you guys."
"6975180","6975580"," I gotta go. "
"6976060","6980760"," I'm gonna put on CNBC and, uh, you'll see some big changes happen on the stream this week."
"6981360","6986700"," Oh, one other programming note on these changes that are coming on the first."
"6988060","6994040"," We are going to be launching a version of the show as a podcast. "
"6996440","6997820"," Which is just audio."
"6998880","7004960"," Uh, so if you cannot watch the show on YouTube or Twitch and you want to listen in via podcast,"
"7006000","7013000"," uh, the show will be going live on the first, uh, as a, as an audio, uh, version."
"7013640","7016100"," Uh, so we'll be launching that here shortly as well. "
"7016780","7018360"," So look for that coming out here shortly."
"7019000","7023480"," Uh, if you're, uh, want to listen to as you're driving down the road, you don't have, uh, Apple or"
"7023480","7025800"," smart, a smart, uh, smart car or something like that."
"7025800","7028800"," Or Apple, um, play or anything like that in your car. "
"7028860","7033120"," You just want to tune in, uh, maybe via your phone via a podcasting."
"7033460","7035260"," Uh, we're going to have a radio show."
"7035860","7037080"," Uh, that's the same. "
"7037100","7042560"," It's this show, but via a version of a version of via radio or something like that."
"7042620","7043000"," I can say it."
"7043080","7043620"," I'll say it like that. "
"7050970","7052130"," I love you, Nina, man."
"7053530","7055630"," I see you guys come to my defense."
"7056030","7057650"," I want you to know that I see it. "
"7057990","7060490"," That's, that means more dude than you know."
"7061370","7064550"," Um, I see you guys do that, defend me in places."
"7064850","7065230"," I see it. "

"14291590","14297170"," sellers here We got to destroy right Before you can even make the next run higher."
"14297850","14305570"," This is a lot of volatility here To get to the next level anyways Uh, the next one is uh,"

"16477210","16487189"," We have a we have a pin right now in 4900 And as that"

"16490750","16496910"," So you were coming into the weekly close on friday Uh that option strike like 4,900 or whatever is"
"16496910","16503930"," is like we're drawn to it Uh now there's also dealer hedging involved right and uh involved in that"
"16503930","16508869"," pin Uh, and there's a rebalancing of market maker books that kind of stuff to neutralize their risk"
"16509669","16518270"," Yeah, so we end up uh gravitating towards that 4900 we're right as of right now 4,900 until Uh"
"16518270","16528540"," that that gamma rolls off the books in this case would be friday And"
"16528540","16533119"," every time we go above that level that another point too is every time we hit that 4,900 dealers"
"16533119","16560650"," will sell it So we'll slam into 4,900 sell it down slam into it sell it down Or"
"16560650","16561830"," maybe I can explain it better."
"16562150","16563710"," I don't know if it's a simpler way to sell it. "
"16564369","16571830"," So price is attracted Due to that gamma pin That's roughly right here."
"16572290","16582689"," Uh, it's right here Hold on a second, let me do it This"
"16582689","16592669"," is uh call gamma gamma Right here Okay, so the stock"
"16592669","16602050"," market is attracted to that number right there every time we hit it a Market maker rebalances"
"16602050","16639910"," Can I write"
"16639910","16640730"," magnet on this?"
"16641550","16651509"," I don't know if I can Magnet magnet Call gamma 4,900 magnet"
"16651509","16658730"," price is attracted here so Price untethered should run up into that number At the same time market"
"16658730","16663849"," makers step in into friday and sell into that That's why you see these drops down and then it goes"
"16663849","16671930"," back up drops down back up As that call gamma wanes into friday, we should see a roll into friday"

"17787860","17792680"," We're always part of the economy we live in however Uh, we have about 2.5 million square feet of"
"17792680","17799040"," retail in in asia both in singapore and the cow Uh, we did about 700 million dollars of"

"17815500","17820940"," customer base Two is we get the best stores and the best type of that store So the environment we"
"17821400","17826300"," Shall sell these luxury products in is is a very very nice environment different when they but they"
"17826300","17831700"," get at home And thirdly in a resort environment you tend to spend more money you're more carefree"
"17831700","17834400"," You're more inclined to spend money."
"17834560","17840920"," So I think we're the lucky recipients of that those three things Our retail sales are far beyond"
"17840920","17851660"," 2019 and the quarter was down the they were doing $9,000 So"
"17851660","17858400"," can we talk about singapore because your commentary yesterday on the conference call was so bullish"
"17858940","17863900"," Here you have construction taking out a couple thousand rooms last quarter trying to visit station"
"17863900","17871880"," isn't fully back And yet the casino is just raking it in making $339 million more than the previous"
"17871880","17877900"," year, that's 84% more, 84% than that same quarter in 2022. "
"17878920","17881100"," When your occupancy was higher, why?"
"17881760","17882400"," And is that sustainable?"
"17884000","17885540"," First of all, it's a record quarter."
"17885740","17887420"," It's in a history of our Singapore operation."
"17887620","17890900"," It is the number one quarter of $544 million, the EBITDA. "
"17891400","17893280"," It's a lot of factors contributing."
"17893720","17894820"," Yes, it can seem to be very well."
"17895260","17899540"," The hotel is on the renovation as you referenced, which is a big negative, which means the future"
"17899540","17901540"," is even brighter from our perspective. "
"17901540","17904240"," The retail was extraordinary this quarter."
"17904620","17905760"," The gaming was extraordinary."
"17906540","17912200"," Singapore is a very, very desirable place to visit and we have the best hotel in the neighborhood. "
"17912980","17918620"," And although the construction clearly is an impediment, it looks to me as though Singapore is on a"
"17918620","17921540"," terrific run and will continue for years to come."
"17921540","17927260"," We see the $2 billion annualized EBITDA asset and beyond the next four or five years growing,"
"17927400","17928940"," hopefully another 10 or 15%."
"17929380","17933600"," And we are speaking with the government, hopefully, when they approve it to build another tower in"
"17933600","17937260"," Singapore in the future, which would be very additive to our earnings there. "
"17937480","17941240"," So we're raging bulls on Singapore and we should be."
"17941860","17944020"," I want to ask a couple of questions, Rob, if I might."
"17944220","17950500"," I mean, you mentioned the word lock in explaining something a few moments ago. "
"17950500","17954880"," Where CEO can say, well, it was just lock, it boiled down the luck and be believed."
"17955780","17956600"," So, so good for you."
"17957320","17961100"," Revenues are hot in the casino business for you. "
"17961280","17963860"," I mean, just breathtaking growth in revenues."
"17964560","17966640"," How do you explain that?"
"17967700","17971780"," And number two, your stock is down about 10% over the past year."
"17972700","17973660"," How do you explain that?"
"17973800","17975240"," And what are they not crediting you for?"
"17975780","17978140"," Let me just address the luck issue. "
"17978440","17982320"," Luck perhaps is a misnomer because it really is a is not a luck business."
"17982560","17984440"," It's a it's a mathematics driven business."
"17984680","17986860"," In the end, there's no real luck. "
"17987180","17990340"," You're lucky one day, one place and not so much in the other."
"17990480","17992580"," In the end, the mathematics always prevail."
"17992620","17994340"," So the luck factor goes away. "
"17994620","17996100"," We don't build these places on luck."
"17996480","17999700"," As far as the stock price, we just keep our heads down and keep performing."
"17999700","18001680"," We bought back a lot of shares last quarter. "
"18001680","18003640"," We do our job, which is great."
"18003860","18008860"," Lots of EBITDA and then buy back shares and run these businesses to the best of our ability, our"
"18008860","18009420"," teams perform."
"18010240","18015160"," And in the end, someday, the stock price will reflect the nature of our business. "
"18015540","18018800"," I can't spend every day worrying about the prices up, the prices down."
"18019120","18020760"," We had great results yesterday."
"18021160","18022820"," We're very bullish on 2024. "
"18023720","18026860"," And someday, the market will recognize what we have here."
"18026860","18032700"," I can't explain to you why we're pricing like COVID numbers as opposed to pre COVID."
"18032960","18038460"," Investors are just not giving you any credit for Macau reopening or the whether rebound in"
"18038460","18038800"," Singapore. "
"18039080","18042180"," It's clear, although your president and COO said yesterday."
"18042460","18044800"," But the share price means there's a great buying opportunity."
"18044920","18045620"," And so we did. "
"18045900","18046460"," Here's half of that."
"18046580","18047060"," Yeah."
"18047540","18047760"," Yeah. "
"18047960","18049980"," Patrick Reppin is $755 million."
"18050420","18051140"," It's a lot of money."
"18051140","18054300"," And we'll keep buying back shares because we believe in our company very much. "
"18054300","18060860"," You talked a bit yesterday about the New York opportunity and that Texas opportunity Las Vegas"
"18060860","18064760"," stands now doesn't have domestic operations in the United States."
"18064880","18069720"," And I know you've put tens of millions of dollars into both of these states in lobbying for a"
"18069720","18070340"," license and whatever."
"18070760","18077240"," Can you give me a sense about how you think about the development and the way that might ensure"
"18077240","18079620"," that eventually there is a casino license?"
"18080540","18082900"," Are you talking to New York and New York and Texas?"
"18083080","18086580"," I mean, Patrick said we're looking forward to building a development there. "
"18087120","18088840"," Well, we'd like to be in both places."
"18089000","18094480"," But for today, New York is in a process to govern herself alluded to it this week as perhaps a"
"18094480","18095620"," decision in 24."
"18096340","18100900"," As you know, we require the lease sold in Nassau at the Coliseum as for just the ability to build"
"18100900","18107400"," a true destination resort of scale and importance and provide tens of thousands of jobs both"
"18107400","18109400"," construction and operating jobs. "
"18109400","18115400"," So we want to build a five star hotel, a Canyon Ranch, lots of conventions based and build"
"18115400","18119560"," something, but very much a very desirable resort in New York."
"18119840","18123660"," But at least New York has a process in place and they will make a decision."
"18124020","18125820"," Texas at this point does not have that. "
"18125980","18128060"," We are working towards encouraging people."
"18128200","18128760"," Think about it."
"18129040","18131860"," But Texas does not have a process in place today. "
"18132340","18135400"," We'll be patient and we'll be advocates and wait to see how that goes."
"18135400","18139700"," But New York, we're hoping for a decision because we think we can build something in the six"
"18139700","18144640"," billion dollar neighborhood that will be astounding and very, very helpful tourism in that state"
"18144640","18146560"," and very much a big taxpayer as well."
"18146780","18148960"," So New York is on the table now. "
"18149320","18150940"," Texas on the table down the road."
"18151100","18156200"," There is a there's sharp elbows when it comes to those casino licenses up for grabs in New York."
"18156440","18157760"," Rob, it's great to see you. "
"18157960","18158840"," Thank you for your time."
"18159000","18165380"," Appreciate that."
"18165380","18170060"," The new appraisal Americans don't consider home ownership, the financial achievement it once was. "
"18170600","18174000"," We will discuss that and much more when power luck continues."
"18365470","18366330"," Slash higher."
"18371180","18372620"," Here we go three minutes left. "
"18373040","18374240"," Several more stories you need to know."
"18374380","18375520"," Let's get to it right now."
"18375760","18379040"," Bank of America says it's time to get back to the office and they mean it. "
"18379040","18382160"," The firm has been sending quote unquote letters of education."
"18382800","18386680"," It sounds a little like a little while you're a little mouled."
"18386680","18392600"," Who have not been showing up in person got these letters that gives them two weeks from the date of"
"18392600","18396980"," notification to comply or face further disciplinary action. "
"18397440","18401100"," Apparently there are some people who just ignored the back to work orders."
"18401100","18403040"," Well, do that back to America."
"18403700","18405000"," All right, let's talk about Costco. "
"18405480","18407100"," Just wrapped up a banner year."
"18407440","18409140"," A banner year for hot dogs."
"18409560","18414140"," The wholesale retailer sold 200 million hot dog combos last year 200 million. "
"18414700","18416740"," A record for the dollar fifty deal."
"18416880","18419500"," The same price as it's been for nearly 40 years."
"18419680","18423360"," Now, there is no inflation in winners apparently at Costco. "
"18424080","18425080"," There you go."
"18425800","18430840"," I said it nearly two thirds of Americans say that buying a home is no longer the measure of"
"18430840","18431260"," achievement."
"18431360","18431940"," It once was. "
"18432240","18434320"," This is according to a new nerd wallet survey."
"18434600","18440220"," Thirty seven percent of respondents say they plan on renting forever with over half saying they"
"18440220","18444640"," don't think they will ever ever be able to afford home ownership."
"18445420","18445840"," We'll see. "
"18446100","18446420"," All right."
"18446680","18450920"," Lots of excitement about playoffs, of course, in the Super Bowl Draft King spandles, scissors, but"
"18450920","18452280"," MGM, they get so much attention."
"18452940","18456380"," But investors might want to watch the tech power behind sports books. "
"18456880","18459920"," Genius sports is the exclusive NFL data provider."
"18460500","18461580"," Here it is publicly traded."
"18462020","18467720"," It makes many off licensing fees and revenue sharing with the sports books and it makes three times"
"18467720","18471080"," more on in game bets than pregame wagers. "
"18471080","18477100"," So it's packaging the football feed in this unique way with like augmented reality so that viewers"
"18477100","18481540"," can see the odds of a specific play just as it's getting ready to happen."
"18482060","18486960"," And then they sell that to media companies as well for better audience engagement and they sell it"
"18486960","18489620"," back to the teams which want the data to improve their own performance."
"18490480","18494460"," It's really a duopoly here because genius is bigger competitor is sport radar. "
"18494680","18500120"," It has deals with nearly all the other major pro sports leagues and 90% of the sports books."
"18500120","18501940"," Michael Jordan is a big investor."
"18502080","18508380"," The stock down almost 9% this week, though on the news that the CFO and the chief strategy officer"
"18508380","18512800"," are both departing but they have a big international business where they go in. "
"18512960","18519500"," They scoop up the content from a country like Premier League in soccer, but even lower like"
"18519500","18519760"," Columbia."
"18519940","18525240"," But then what happens is when the sports books expand and they need the content, they have to"
"18525240","18526760"," license it then from sport radar."
"18526760","18529760"," So it's it's about prop bets are in game bets is where they. "
"18529960","18533920"," Well, you know, the prop bets are something separate and the sports books really do that."
"18533960","18537000"," I'll see it now has two catches in the game or two touchdowns."
"18537580","18538960"," I'm going to bet that he's going to get a better. "
"18539120","18544560"," Even more like will he complete this pass to the touchdown and you can see what are the what are"
"18544560","18546920"," the odds or like what's the chances of this happening."
"18546920","18549440"," So yeah, there's a lot of engagement around that."
"18549720","18550300"," There we go. "

"18586120","18587640"," I don't know if it's even worse than before. "
"18599100","18602360"," Negative and as you see at the bottom of your screen there, it's barely positive."
"18602580","18605140"," Now there's no debating what Tesla's doing today."
"18605360","18607560"," It's having an awful day following its earnings report. "
"18607620","18613600"," That stock, by the way, no longer one of the so-called magnificent seven because as its market cap"
"18613600","18614640"," continues to shrink."
"18615340","18616620"," It's dropped out of the top 10."
"18617300","18620460"," Humana, another of the day's worst S&P stocks. "
"18621120","18623860"," And that after its guidance came in very disappointing today."
"18624400","18628400"," We're watching yields too following up much better than expected GDP report."
"18628860","18631100"," You see the 10 years at four 13. "
"18631360","18632340"," So we're watching all of that."
"18632460","18633960"," It does take us to our talk of the tape."
"18634380","18639360"," Top heavy tech and whether it is time to take some profits in some of the market's biggest winners. "
"18639980","18641740"," Let's ask light streets Glen Kater."
"18641820","18643020"," He does join us now live."
"18643120","18643600"," Welcome back. "
"18643780","18645240"," Happy New Year and it's nice to see you again."
"18645240","18646680"," Nice to see you Scott."
"18647000","18647640"," Thanks for having me on. "
"18647900","18649800"," So how about that question."
"18650540","18654860"," Whether there's just simply too much money in too few names in this market."
"18655240","18660020"," What looked like broadening out really isn't materializing and we're right back to where we were. "
"18660260","18660640"," What do you think?"
"18661420","18664120"," Well, I think you have to ask yourself what's driving the market."
"18664520","18670760"," In our view, the most important trend in technology is the move to artificial intelligence and the"
"18670760","18672380"," importance of the GPU."
"18673860","18678080"," Compute infrastructure getting built out over the next five to 10 years. "
"18678540","18684940"," That's a really lasting long term push by big platforms and tech."
"18685680","18689660"," And so there's a lot of opportunity for some of the largest market companies."
"18691160","18696560"," The question I guess as people would I'm sure agree with you because you're in a lot of these names"
"18696560","18697120"," in video. "
"18697120","18700960"," Meta Microsoft alphabet AMD."
"18701520","18703200"," I mean these are among your top 10 holdings."
"18703720","18707400"," The key question of course Glenn is what multiple do you pay for that. "
"18707680","18712240"," Now how do you respond to those who would say look I agree with everything that you said."
"18712880","18716500"," It's transformational technology but the multiples have just gotten too stretched."
"18717600","18721920"," Well, I think there are cases where some of them are stretched when you look at the compare it. "
"18722100","18725680"," You know those fundamentals to the growth that these companies are seeing."
"18725680","18731860"," I'd say within the magnificent seven I'd say Apple sticks out as a company that whose growth is"
"18731860","18733520"," moderating dramatically."
"18734260","18737620"," And I'd say the other would be Tesla as we're seeing today in the market. "
"18737900","18742100"," So those are two that where I see it think the fundamentals have slowed down."
"18742440","18751640"," At the same time I look at what's happening at Microsoft and Nvidia and AMD and I see faster growth"
"18751640","18752160"," happening."
"18752160","18757100"," And you look at Nvidia it hasn't really been cheaper than this for a long time. "
"18757820","18764020"," And you know there was a lot of skepticism built up by investors worried that well it can't get any"
"18764020","18764700"," better than this."
"18764820","18765820"," Well it is getting better."
"18766380","18772720"," And this is the time to invest and these are the companies that are powering the move to AI which"
"18772720","18776500"," is what all the large platforms walk to deliver to their own customers. "
"18776500","18779880"," So I'm going to get to Tesla in a moment because I do want to talk to you about it"
"18779880","18782080"," and I did mention that you of course own it."
"18782180","18788440"," But I want to sort of hone in on this idea of you know whether it's time to take some"
"18788440","18791340"," profits in some of these names whether they're over bought."
"18791960","18797140"," I want you to listen to what Josh Brown told me earlier today Glenn on the halftime report about"
"18797140","18798260"," selling AMD. "
"18798980","18804360"," A stock he only got into around Halloween but it's gone crazy since then."
"18804360","18805420"," So he sold it."
"18805520","18807740"," Here's what he said and then I want you to take on the other side please. "
"18809660","18811600"," This is a stock that's up 81%."
"18811600","18814540"," AMD hit 78 relative strength index."
"18815180","18817940"," It's 33% above its 50 day moving average. "
"18818480","18821040"," It's 60% above its 200 day moving average."
"18822460","18823540"," What do you do with that?"
"18824860","18831020"," Sure specifically on AMD I think you're seeing them move into a period where they're going to take"
"18831020","18834220"," a tremendous amount of market share in the GPU business."
"18834220","18838800"," And specifically at the network level not for gaming. "
"18839540","18844740"," And so that's a big opportunity for the company and I think looking at a stock on what it's done"
"18844740","18850540"," over the past 100 days or 200 days or whatever the timeframe you want to pick is a very limited"
"18850540","18853440"," way of doing stock analysis."
"18854060","18860040"," If you want to think about the future and where the stock's going to go in the future you need"
"18860040","18860540"," to look ahead."
"18860540","18863660"," You need to look ahead to what the future fundamentals are and what you're paying for that. "
"18864240","18870440"," So while AMD might look expensive today they are as I said seeing major growth and I think the"
"18870440","18878600"," companies kept the lid on expectations for the MI 300 chip chip shipping into customers like"
"18878600","18880680"," Microsoft and the other hyperscalers."
"18880680","18887400"," I think in terms of stock in the magnificent seven week we have taken profits."
"18887400","18896100"," I mean we did sell our Tesla before the end of the year we sold our Google as well. "
"18896620","18901700"," And so we have taken profits in places we don't own Apple and haven't owned it for a while."
"18902520","18911780"," So at the same time I think I still feel great about Meda, feel great about Microsoft, Nvidia AMD."
"18912060","18912680"," Those are for a few. "
"18912880","18917700"," I'd say people talk about the magnificent seven maybe it's time frankly that we move on to"
"18917700","18918200"," something new."
"18918780","18924680"," And whether that's the core four or the AI five or whatever you want to call it but Microsoft,"
"18925060","18934740"," Nvidia, AMD, TSMC and Broadcom would to me be the key five names in AI"
"18934740","18936620"," so there's your AI five."
"18937000","18940060"," Yeah interesting we may take you up on that. "
"18940240","18942240"," We'll give you credit don't worry if we do."
"18942460","18943900"," I do want to talk about Tesla right."
"18944180","18946920"," You just said you just told our viewers that you no longer own it. "
"18947240","18948480"," I believe you're out completely."
"18948760","18950760"," Let's just make sure I'm with you."
"18950860","18951440"," You're out completely?"
"18952120","18959360"," Okay so what are we to make today of this dumpster fire around the stock which really it is. "
"18959860","18966400"," And just how we're supposed to assess where this company is now and where the stock may go from"
"18966400","18966600"," here."
"18967180","18968620"," Well we have to have a little perspective."
"18969160","18976620"," I mean they do make the best selling car in the world in Model Y and it's on a gross"
"18976620","18979580"," margin basis and an operating cash flow basis. "
"18979580","18985780"," It's been a very profitable automaker which a lot of its competitors especially traditional OEMs"
"18985780","18987300"," can't write about that."
"18987600","18991520"," So it's a company that is still well positioned for the future."
"18991780","18998620"," I think the question is we've seen this low down in the overall auto market that's hit both EVs and"
"18998620","19001080"," traditional ICE cars. "
"19001830","19010080"," But when you see that happen it's a lot harder when you're coming from a position of having a 50x"
"19010080","19015900"," PE as opposed to a four or five or six PE for the traditional OEM."
"19016240","19024500"," So there's the opportunity for multiple compression is really there for a standout company that's"
"19024500","19027560"," been on a tremendous run like Tesla has."
"19027560","19030240"," So you know we're seeing a reset here. "
"19030600","19038180"," I think in the long term they're still going to be the number one or two and depending on the"
"19038180","19042340"," battle with BYD in the future maker of EVs globally."
"19042980","19051200"," And we do believe long term that the shift to EVs is still occurring and it's occurring on an S"
"19051200","19056100"," curve trajectory for the overall industry."
"19056100","19057520"," Yeah, what about Alphabet?"
"19057860","19059980"," Why did you sell that at the end of last year?"
"19061020","19068740"," Yeah, I think that the cost of them adopting AI is significant in the upfront. "
"19070000","19077420"," It's not clear to us that the adoption of AI into their search business really enhances the revenue"
"19077420","19083980"," per search in the near term and the ability to match ads more efficiently."
"19083980","19090780"," And so for this period of time, you know, we just like wanted to have bigger positions in the"
"19090780","19096720"," companies where we see really established business models with high margins and low multiples like"
"19096720","19100220"," Nvidia specifically and TSMC."
"19100220","19103000"," Yeah, Palo Alto you're in as well. "
"19103560","19110580"," You mentioned Taiwan semi whose own market cap is now, you know, elevating high as well Microsoft"
"19110580","19112340"," $3 trillion in market cap."
"19112580","19118940"," Did you in part as well with parting with Alphabet just make the decision that Microsoft had"
"19118940","19120480"," essentially won that race?"
"19122680","19132440"," I don't know that any race has been won yet in AI particularly, but the race that Microsoft has won"
"19132440","19137800"," very clearly over the last 30 years is in productivity applications."
"19138580","19146280"," And you know, you look at the way the average business uses Microsoft and how important it is to"
"19146280","19146480"," them. "
"19146480","19152560"," Their email is coming in they're creating documents whether it's word Excel PowerPoint and other"
"19152560","19153160"," applications."
"19153760","19160280"," And we look at forward and think that AI every piece of data that comes into your organization is"
"19160280","19162460"," going to go through AI."
"19163060","19170480"," And that's going to happen at Microsoft on their servers as you're using Office 365 and then to"
"19170480","19173140"," extend your sending out information that's going to go through AI. "
"19173140","19178800"," And it's really going to guide the worker today the knowledge worker on how to spend their time and"
"19178800","19183260"," what to focus on and the potential value add for Microsoft is tremendous."
"19183660","19189600"," I don't think that value add has really shown up yet in their earnings estimates."
"19190100","19196700"," And so we think that the stock is while it's, you know, not necessarily cheap for the growth. "
"19196700","19202720"," We think that the growth in the coming years is going to be far higher than what people are looking"
"19202720","19203140"," for today."
"19203480","19207220"," Let's talk about a couple of stocks that are, you know, not usually on our radar but are certainly"
"19207220","19209500"," on yours because they are among your top 10 holdings."
"19210480","19211440"," GitLab, GTLB. "
"19212200","19212980"," Why do you like it?"
"19213920","19220800"," Yeah, it's been a very important platform for companies building the next generation of"
"19220800","19221200"," applications."
"19221200","19228420"," And so when we're looking at software companies, we want to invest in companies whose products are"
"19228420","19233240"," really critical and necessary and can't be turned off."
"19233740","19240360"," And if you're a developer of software, whether it's GitLab or whether it's JFrog, these are"
"19240360","19246800"," incredibly important pieces of technology and infrastructure for building your core business"
"19246800","19250960"," applications that you're sending to customers and maintaining. "
"19251420","19256020"," And so those are the kinds of critical applications that we want to be investors."
"19256340","19262920"," You own the JFrog company that you just mentioned to correct its frog is the ticker."
"19263180","19263900"," Then we do. "
"19264140","19264260"," Yes."
"19264960","19267280"," So let me ask you more broadly about your market view."
"19267740","19270540"," And I want you to react to another sound bite if you would. "
"19271180","19277040"," It's from, you know, the very well-known market watcher, Ed Jardini, who is as bullish as anybody."
"19277600","19282920"," He came on with me the other day and just sort of wonders out loud whether there's too much"
"19282920","19285260"," exuberance in the market right now."
"19285440","19289240"," And if we're at the start of something that could get a little dangerous later, listen. "
"19291480","19296540"," Look how much the market has come up since October of last year, which I think is roughly when"
"19296540","19300140"," everybody concluded that the Fed was done raising interest rates."
"19300140","19303540"," And then suddenly the conversation became about lowering interest rates."
"19303800","19306840"," Imagine what could happen if the Fed actually starts lowering interest rates. "
"19306940","19311900"," That's what I'm concerned about is that that could spark a melt up in the market."
"19312660","19315220"," You share Ed's thoughts, Glenn or no?"
"19316000","19325660"," Yeah, I think we're always cautious about stocks going up too fast and over representing the"
"19325660","19330640"," current case for their earnings or for market multiples."
"19331160","19336400"," So I think when we put our macroeconomic hat on, we're looking at that. "
"19336620","19344760"," I look at that said, I look at 2024 and I see a marginally improving economy."
"19345540","19353140"," I see pretty strong government spending that's unlikely to be pulled back in an election year."
"19353140","19356240"," And I feel like things are pretty good. "
"19356420","19358980"," And I think the market has responded to that though at this point."
"19359160","19365860"," So you have to say, hey, do you want to buy, load up your portfolio today after a strong end"
"19365860","19368760"," of last year and beginning of this year in certain names?"
"19369300","19370760"," That's for you to decide."
"19371560","19377080"," They were for the investor to decide for themselves, dollar cost average into opportunities. "
"19377080","19383000"," But when I put on my long term, had an hour sector and I say, you know, what's really happening"
"19383000","19383720"," in technology?"
"19383840","19389940"," The investment in AI and the infrastructure underneath them, AI."
"19390280","19398180"," We're building the bridges, the tunnels and the railroads for information over the next decade."
"19398860","19399420"," And it's a race. "
"19399740","19406100"," There's a race aspect to it for the big companies that already have a lot of customers, customers'"
"19406440","19409360"," data, and capital, they don't want to lose that race."
"19409620","19414380"," They want to provide their end customers with solutions, with AI solutions."
"19414740","19422940"," And in order to do that, Microsoft and Google and Facebook and Oracle, they need spend, SAP. "
"19423820","19430840"," So you're seeing them spend dramatically on AI infrastructure and you're starting to see real"
"19430840","19438460"," anecdotal information about success with AI investment, whether it be from SAP or service now."
"19439200","19445280"," And I think it's still early at Microsoft, but you're going to see real value being added to their"
"19445280","19445920"," end customers."
"19446320","19450800"," I'm going to welcome in a couple others in just a second. "
"19450940","19456040"," But quickly, just to tie this up, what does your overall exposure look like just so I have an idea"
"19456040","19460680"," of how long you are, or where you currently are positioning here in this market?"
"19460680","19465320"," Yeah, I mean, I'd say we're at the high end of our normal ranges."
"19465840","19467680"," You know, we do have a hedge fund product."
"19467680","19469200"," We have also have a long-only product. "
"19469480","19476780"," So the long-only products fully invested in the hedge fund products at the higher end of the net"
"19476780","19479080"," exposure category."
"19479280","19486200"," I think the most important exposures is our exposure to semis and then to hyperscalers in the"
"19486200","19486500"," sector."
"19487100","19488840"," That's where we want to focus our capital. "
"19488840","19489780"," I got you."
"19490120","19494580"," Let's welcome in Joe Terranova now a Virtus investment partner, Stephanie Link of Hightower, both"
"19494580","19495700"," of course CNBC contributors."
"19496520","19497640"," Steph, I'll go to you first. "
"19497960","19500020"," I know you listened to the conversation with Glenn."
"19500260","19504020"," Just give me your thoughts on, you know, where he is in the market, whether you agree with it."
"19504080","19510680"," You may not be as overweight, some of these hyperscalers, if you will, in AI, but he laid out a"
"19510680","19515480"," number of reasons in terms of why he thinks these are the stocks that are going to do best. "
"19516560","19520700"," Sure, well, I mean, we always talk about total addressable markets, and I think the discussion was"
"19520700","19521720"," really about that."
"19522400","19528180"," You have to be, though, diversified, and you know that I am not in a lot of the MAG 7,"
"19528480","19533480"," but I am playing some of the theme, same themes within technology, just with different names that"
"19533480","19535540"," are not as owned, right?"
"19535780","19538740"," So I do, you know, I do own Amazon."
"19539220","19539920"," That was a big purchase. "
"19540200","19541960"," You know, I was recently buying Broadcom."
"19542260","19543480"," That was a big purchase."
"19543480","19549740"," But on terms of the other MAG 7s, I only really own Alphabet, and I am slightly underweight. "
"19550000","19552120"," So I think there are other ways you can win in technology."
"19552960","19554120"," Again, with the same themes."
"19554580","19559200"," As I mentioned, Broadcom, certainly it's the data center cloud, AI, networking. "
"19559900","19560980"," That's certain, and it's cheap."
"19561280","19564020"," It's not expensive at 24 times, given the growth."
"19564580","19566000"," But I also own other things. "
"19566320","19567360"," We can talk about IBM."
"19568100","19571900"," That's very under-owned, and it was a solid quarter, but really good free cash flow."
"19572560","19573080"," CDW. "
"19573460","19576540"," I'm playing a bottoming in the PC cycle, and lamb research."
"19577140","19581300"," I'm playing the wafer fab equipment spend, and that's increasing."
"19583760","19588160"," And the company raised their guidance on wafer fab equipment for the third time in the last three"
"19588160","19588600"," quarters. "
"19589180","19592320"," And so I think there are places you can be in tech."
"19592620","19597920"," But I also think that just given the Goldilocks number we saw today in GDP with better growth and"
"19597920","19603200"," lower inflation, that is going to translate into a broadening out of better earnings across a lot"
"19603200","19604080"," of different sectors."
"19604260","19610440"," And so you know that I have been very much diversified in spending other my time and energy on"
"19610440","19613660"," other parts of the market, because I think that's where the value really is. "
"19613860","19614520"," Yeah, Joe."
"19614800","19618240"," I mean, Glenn's really in the epicenter of this AI revolution."
"19619020","19620700"," You are in many respects too. "
"19621140","19621880"," What do you make of what he said?"
"19622640","19629980"," Think about where we would be today, January of 2024, without the revelation in 2023 of this"
"19629980","19633660"," advancement of innovation from artificial intelligence to generative AI."
"19634000","19637580"," I couldn't possibly imagine where the capital markets in fact would be."
"19637740","19639320"," I think it's something that we need to embrace. "
"19639560","19641260"," I think Glenn is spot on."
"19641480","19647000"," You have to think about this innovation with a mindset of where will we be three to five years from"
"19647000","19647300"," now."
"19647300","19654380"," You have to understand that the companies that are spending, they are the world's financially"
"19654380","19655800"," strongest corporation. "
"19656380","19659120"," And that should give you the confidence that innovation is real."
"19659720","19663280"," The innovation extends really the sweet spot as the semis."
"19663320","19665580"," And we've talked about that at Lane if I agree with Stephanie. "
"19666260","19674480"," I think Broadcom is such a fairly valued and an ideal way to play the growth of generative AI."
"19674740","19679820"," But you could also look at cadence design systems, which we really don't talk about very much, but"
"19679820","19683980"," think about the software that's needed to actually develop the semiconductor."
"19684100","19687600"," And that's in fact what CDNS is doing. "
"19687600","19691900"," So you have to think about the long term as it relates to the near term Scott."
"19691900","19699820"," Look, the market had a very powerful breakout that was built upon systematic buying last Friday."
"19699820","19706140"," We went from 4,800 up to 4,903 as I sat here with you yesterday on halftime very quickly. "
"19706500","19710040"," It appears to me that systematic buying has kind of disappeared."
"19710180","19714180"," I don't think you could expect that you're going to see that buying present on breakouts anymore."
"19714180","19720000"," I think what's critical in the near term for the markets is the buy the dip mentality still there. "
"19720200","19723140"," And the buy the dip mentality appears to still be in place."
"19723400","19728500"," Hey Glenn, let's talk cyber for a moment because an area that everybody in this conversation is in"
"19728500","19730540"," but me, of course."
"19731440","19732880"," You got Palo Alto. "
"19733380","19735720"," Just a note here, if you're watching down below."
"19738280","19740900"," Intel parked on its hourly trigger."
"19740900","19747840"," And then we have the nice bounce down here on Visa down below to the upside. "
"19747840","19749660"," Nice squeeze going higher right now."
"19750640","19753040"," If you took that long with me, congratulations."
"19755480","19764910"," Even though those companies, the leaders are likely to"
"19764910","19768030"," be able to adopt AI and utilize that in their business. "
"19768370","19769090"," That's great."
"19769530","19778090"," But for now, I prefer to own the core infrastructure names Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, TSMC and a"
"19778090","19785130"," Bongo, rather than one of the companies like Palo Alto that might be able to apply some of that"
"19785130","19785730"," learning."
"19785730","19788530"," I want to just own those core infrastructure names in AI. "
"19789190","19789890"," Glenn, it's Joe."
"19790110","19793210"," We're using this word euphoria quite a bit in the last several days."
"19793570","19798070"," Would you assign the word euphoria to the investment thesis surrounding cyber security?"
"19798690","19800930"," Because myself personally, I'm pretty heavily invested there. "
"19801230","19802410"," Scott mentioned CrowdStrike."
"19802630","19805530"," I also have Palo Alto and we do have Fortinet in the ETF."
"19807450","19809630"," I don't know that I would use that word. "
"19809810","19813390"," I mean, this is a sector that's been incredibly important."
"19813390","19821530"," If you do any survey of CIOs, it's in the top three and has been for the last decade."
"19821790","19823190"," So this is not a flash in the pan. "
"19823450","19825730"," This is not a euphoric situation."
"19826510","19834190"," You've seen over the years the news stories around vulnerabilities, break-ins to companies, and"
"19834190","19842770"," then holding companies hostage over the weekend and having them pay with crypto to free their data"
"19842770","19845210"," so that their businesses don't get interrupted."
"19845810","19850230"," Those are all very real threats and risks. "
"19850690","19855110"," And companies can't afford to have those situations happen."
"19855390","19860210"," So they're doing everything they can to prevent them from occurring."
"19861030","19862910"," And so I like the sector. "
"19862910","19871290"," It's just I like the core semis better than the application group of"
"19871290","19873610"," network security."
"19873970","19879330"," These are those critical decisions, Steph, that you all as investors have to make, whether it's"
"19879330","19886830"," Josh selling AMD, whether it's Glenn selling Palo Alto, whether it's you selling meta."
"19887450","19894010"," There are a select group of stocks that I guess you all have determined have just gone up too much"
"19894010","19894570"," too fast. "
"19895090","19897770"," But there are many others who are in similar standing."
"19898410","19904970"," These are, I don't know how you come to the decisions that you do to pick one of those names"
"19904970","19907210"," and decide you know what enough is enough."
"19907390","19913150"," And we may be at the point now where investors are assessing their own portfolios and their gains"
"19913150","19914150"," in some of these stocks. "
"19914150","19916370"," And they're like, I don't really know what to do."
"19917690","19919870"," The hardest thing to do is selling a stock."
"19920310","19922530"," It's much easier in my opinion to buy a stock. "
"19923090","19927810"," So, but I think when you have a stock that's up a hundred and seventy five, eighty percent, you"
"19927810","19930150"," have some of these stocks that are up two hundred percent."
"19930730","19932150"," I mean, you just can't be that greedy."
"19932850","19935150"," Doesn't necessarily mean you have to sell the entire position. "
"19935870","19938530"," But I think you have to right size it at one point last year."
"19938530","19941170"," Meta was nine percent of my portfolio."
"19941270","19942570"," I'm not comfortable with that. "
"19942750","19944270"," Some people are, but I'm not."
"19944790","19948610"," And I think that that stopped now, by the way, trades at twenty seven times for estimates."
"19948730","19951610"," That's basically where it's traded at its historical average. "
"19951810","19953670"," I was buying it when it was at thirteen times."
"19954230","19958150"," And so, yeah, you have seen these multiple re ratings on these stocks."
"19958370","19961070"," And I understand again, the total decimal markets are real. "
"19961310","19961970"," They're big time."
"19962670","19966750"," But I'm trying to find maybe either some laggards or some less popular companies."
"19967310","19970590"," I'm going to stick with something like coordinate, just because you guys were just talking about"
"19970590","19970770"," cyber. "
"19971090","19972890"," It's a trillion dollar total addressable market."
"19973070","19978090"," And there really are only five big, big players that I think are going to ultimately be the"
"19978090","19978410"," winners."
"19978810","19980970"," Fortinet was a horrible stock last year. "
"19981350","19983090"," And so, I'm playing for mean reversion."
"19983230","19987550"," It trades at half the multiple that to Palo Alto and the group."
"19988030","19990110"," And it really has lagged again year to date. "
"19990370","19994270"," So, I'm thinking that the trends are going to continue to be very powerful in cyber security."
"19994270","19998570"," I'm trying to find a laggard of reversion to the mean story, a turnaround story."
"19998910","20000250"," It's definitely a show me story. "
"20000630","20004410"," But I do think I'll make some money in that because I like the end market as a whole."
"20004890","20006150"," Glenn, last word to you."
"20006370","20007350"," Base case, soft landing. "
"20007550","20008310"," Is that where you're at now?"
"20009350","20010390"," I'd say so, yeah."
"20010730","20014310"," We're reevaluating at the end of the year, you know, post the election."
"20014710","20022330"," But we feel strong about the economy and even better about the investment, the core semiconductor"
"20022330","20022810"," universe. "
"20023590","20024550"," Good stuff, everybody."
"20024930","20025410"," Appreciate it."
"20025510","20025990"," Glenn, you're time. "
"20026150","20026390"," Very much."
"20026550","20026850"," Thank you."
"20026930","20027490"," We'll talk to you soon. "
"20027590","20028870"," Glenn, Kate, your light street stuff."
"20029150","20029490"," Thank you."
"20029730","20030530"," Joe Turnover. "
"20030530","20031130"," Thank you as well."
"20031610","20033150"," We have breaking news out of the auto space."
"20033150","20035130"," Who else could deliver it for us?"
"20036550","20038970"," Hey, Scott, take a look at shares of General Motors. "
"20039290","20040370"," Why are we showing UGM?"
"20040930","20046530"," Remember, it's subsidiary cruise and the accident that happened in early October where a cruise"
"20046530","20052050"," vehicle autonomous drive vehicle without a driver hit a pedestrian in San Francisco."
"20052050","20055810"," Ultimately, drive the drag the pedestrian about 20 feet."
"20056190","20063270"," Well, ultimately that led to an investigation by regulators in San Francisco and they were not"
"20063270","20067910"," happy with the response of the cruise management and executives to their inquiry. "
"20068730","20072430"," So GM has done an outside investigation of what happened."
"20072710","20078870"," Did we give the right information to the regulators in California and the outside firm has"
"20078870","20085470"," completed a report saying that the cruise officials, executives who were meeting with California"
"20085470","20085930"," regulators."
"20086050","20092310"," They did not intentionally mislead regulators, but they did not do a good job in terms of being as"
"20092310","20097570"," forthcoming and volunteering what information might help the regulators as they were determining"
"20097570","20098530"," what was happening. "
"20098910","20099850"," Bottom line is this."
"20100370","20105250"," They have decided there was no intent to mislead regulators, but that could have been done far"
"20105250","20105570"," better."
"20105690","20110110"," Remember, the cruise CEO was dismissed, a number of other executives were let go. "
"20110350","20112150"," And General Motors is going to use this report."
"20112150","20115450"," Just put out a statement saying this is not how we intend to do business."
"20115870","20120950"," They're going to use this report as they discuss and decide what's the next step in terms of when"
"20120950","20124530"," to potentially return to service with cruise autonomous vehicles. "
"20125210","20127150"," That's the story as you take a look at shares of GM."
"20127390","20128350"," Scott, back to you."
"20128610","20128950"," All right, Phil. "
"20129110","20129990"," I appreciate that very much."
"20130210","20131390"," Phil LeBeau with the latest there."
"20131690","20133090"," We're just getting started here on closing. "
"20133090","20135170"," Next, Intel reporting results in overtime."
"20135710","20140870"," We will hear from star chip analyst Stacey Raskin with his expectations for the numbers."
"20141350","20145490"," He says it's a make or break year for that company for live at the New York Stock Exchange. "
"20145690","20147270"," Back with Stacey after this."
"20350560","20351040"," Calm."
"20352440","20353580"," Ernie Marks on closed. "
"20353820","20354140"," And we're back."
"20354500","20358540"," Let's send it to Christina for the biggest names moving into the close, Christina."
"20358540","20363380"," And I'm going to start with the world's largest equipment rental company leading the S&P 500 today. "
"20363540","20370000"," United Rentals is up about 13% after upping its 2024 guidance management citing fraud based demand"
"20370000","20371040"," across end markets."
"20371040","20376480"," United Rentals also plans to purchase or repurchase $1.5 billion of common stock this year."
"20376700","20381620"," And updates dividend by 10% to $1.63. Of course, investors love that. "
"20382080","20386200"," And right behind United rental in that top gainers club is American Airlines."
"20386200","20391320"," It's 2024 profit guidance beat Wall Street expectations with the carrier citing strong demand over"
"20391320","20393620"," Thanksgiving as well as the holiday season."
"20393940","20399640"," And they also saw a big bump in international travel as more Americans consider overseas travel. "
"20400300","20401660"," And you can see shares up almost 10%."
"20402140","20402780"," All right, Christina."
"20402840","20403420"," We'll see you in just a bit. "
"20403520","20403780"," Thank you."
"20403920","20407160"," Christina parts and novellas Intel reporting earnings in overtime today."
"20407300","20410280"," That stock sharply underperforming the semi surge this month. "
"20410280","20415180"," Our next guest has some key questions for the company this quarter that could reveal whether a"
"20415180","20416780"," turnaround is in fact in the cards."
"20417120","20420000"," Let's bring in Bernstein senior analyst Stacy Raskon."
"20420180","20420680"," Good to see you. "
"20420740","20421060"," Welcome back."
"20421600","20422300"," Good to be here."
"20422560","20425120"," You call this a make or break year for this company. "
"20425120","20427700"," So does it begin with a bang or a thud?"
"20428160","20431480"," No, I actually think they're going to miss the guide in Q1."
"20431480","20433480"," Now, I think most people expect them to miss."
"20434720","20437260"," Q4 PCs were not so great. "
"20437260","20440620"," And you have to remember they still fully consolidate Mobileye."
"20440980","20443220"," Mobileye had an enormous negative free announcement."
"20443220","20447240"," I had to take hundreds of millions of dollars out of my Mobileye numbers for Q1. "
"20447320","20448220"," So they're probably going to miss you."
"20449160","20451420"," I don't know that that's where people will look at that."
"20451560","20453600"," Like I said, there's a lot going on with Intel. "
"20454340","20454920"," This year."
"20455280","20457760"," Like I do think it's a make or break lots of different events."
"20457760","20462580"," They're going to start giving splitting out the manufacturing business and the FPGA business as"
"20462580","20464140"," separate segments in Q1. "
"20464680","20468840"," They've got new data center products coming out, like, especially into the back half with Granite"
"20468840","20471620"," Rapids and we'll see if that starts to reverse the share loss trends that we've had."
"20471620","20473580"," Which have actually been accelerating in recent quarters."
"20474220","20476180"," We'll see if there's anything behind their AI narrative. "
"20476240","20479600"," Clearly, like, there are other players where the AI narrative seems to be stronger."
"20480560","20483160"," I think the PC trajectory should be better."
"20483400","20484560"," You're rear, but still open for debate. "
"20485160","20486320"," They've got a bunch of cost reductions."
"20486420","20487900"," They're trying to push through."
"20488140","20491320"," And, you know, we'll see if they can select to do it on process and foundry. "
"20491600","20493600"," Like, there's just lots going on this year."
"20493700","20494520"," It's going to be an interesting year."
"20494780","20497960"," But I mean, you just said that the PC thing is still up for debate. "
"20498220","20500580"," I thought we had decided that PCs have bottomed."
"20500580","20501620"," Are you questioning that now?"
"20502040","20503520"," They probably have."
"20503820","20508060"," Like, again, year over year, like, where we're looking better and they were flushing out inventory"
"20508060","20509720"," in 23. "
"20510020","20511980"," So that should be better year over year in 24."
"20512760","20515760"," But I think in the near term, it doesn't look quite as strong."
"20516340","20521360"," Like I said, the numbers that came out in Q3, they were down a bit sequentially a little below"
"20521360","20521620"," seasonal. "
"20521940","20523140"," Still still way up year over year."
"20523360","20527100"," But, like, on a relative basis in the near term, they maybe weren't so great."
"20527800","20530340"," You get into the second half and people start to look at there. "
"20530440","20532700"," I don't know if AI PCs are going to do anything, but you'll have that."
"20533020","20537100"," And you got the there's a windows end of life that will be coming up next year that may start"
"20537100","20538280"," to drive demand in the back up."
"20538360","20538920"," So we'll see how it goes. "
"20538920","20540800"," It should be better this year than last year."
"20541020","20548560"," But I mean, if you expect a miss and you know this company better than anybody, why is the stock"
"20548560","20549960"," up 50% in three months?"
"20550440","20551680"," Yeah, that's a great question."
"20551960","20553880"," You know, so I don't exactly know why it went to 50. "
"20554980","20555820"," I'll be honest."
"20555820","20560860"," I do think that a miss on the guy for Q1 is widely anticipated though."
"20560920","20561480"," I think people are too. "
"20561700","20562980"," And that could be part of it, right?"
"20563160","20567400"," You figure you kind of clear the deck and again, if you're positive on these other trends like"
"20567400","20569540"," going forward here, they've got other events happening in Q1."
"20569620","20571400"," They'll have a foundry event and a bunch of other stuff."
"20572380","20576460"," Maybe people are looking for hope, you know, we have the foundry announcement with you and see this"
"20576460","20576700"," morning. "
"20577440","20581740"," They've been talking like really good things in general about the process roadmap and all of that."
"20581780","20584320"," So they're still giving you a little nugget you can dream about if you want to dream."
"20584320","20585440"," I look at it. "
"20585580","20586360"," I'll be honest."
"20586580","20588840"," And again, I've said this, but we mellowed on a little bit."
"20589060","20590420"," You know, we did upgrade it last year. "
"20591520","20593260"," I'm fine, but at the same time."
"20593360","20593460"," Somewhat reluctantly."
"20593780","20594360"," Somewhat reluctantly. "
"20594880","20596400"," I mean, you know, it's up great."
"20596800","20599380"," Look, this year, like there's a lot going on."
"20599640","20601660"," Like they need to execute on all of it. "
"20601760","20603200"," And the stock's like 26 times earnings."
"20603200","20606100"," It's not like that there's a ton of valuation support."
"20606240","20608800"," And I suspect numbers are going to come down before they start going up. "
"20608940","20611840"," So I'm very comfortable right now being on the sidelines with it."
"20612540","20613260"," We'll see you soon."
"20613380","20613500"," Stay. "
"20613640","20613840"," Thanks."
"20614180","20614560"," That's done."
"20615240","20616560"," Yeah, by the way, don't miss John Ford. "
"20616720","20618840"," So first on CNBC interview tonight with Pat Gelsinger."
"20619100","20622380"," You're here part of that conversation seven o'clock Eastern time as part of last call."
"20622700","20622980"," All right. "
"20622980","20627120"," Up next, Apple making some key changes to its overseas app store."
"20627560","20631640"," The details and what it could mean for the future of Apple services growth just after the break."
"20632060","20633360"," Closing bells coming right back. "
"20654710","20657610"," Burr baby burr."
"20659210","20663390"," Can I get a burr to 4900?"
"20666550","20671610"," Burr baby burr."
"20671610","20673570"," Pretty for daddy. "
"20675990","20676750"," 4900."
"20692200","20694500"," Total money market fund assets."
"20694880","20696260"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"20696260","20697860"," And dollars to five spot."
"20697860","20699400"," Nine six trillion dollars."
"20699400","20703900"," These are right now also squeezing higher on a four trigger cluster. "
"20705360","20708440"," Intel park right now and it's hourly."
"20710040","20713840"," Also note that QQ queues is coming into its hourly trigger."
"20714100","20718800"," You might want to take the money and run there soon at four twenty six forty six. "
"20719820","20720980"," S P X."
"20721840","20724560"," With the forty nine hundred."
"20725620","20726180"," Baby."
"20760550","20764650"," Who asked earlier what is a pin and why is it there and why does it matter?"
"20764910","20765830"," Who asked that question. "
"20768890","20771770"," Good job over asked that question out there earlier."
"20773530","20774570"," Good job."
"20774750","20775170"," Good job. "
"20775330","20775810"," Good job."
"20776330","20792900"," I'm going"
"20792900","20796300"," to check the let me just check something here for a moment here."
"20797480","20803900"," Man, what like what time does what time does Intel report. "
"20806100","20806620"," Earnings."
"20806900","20809800"," You know, like sometimes we sit here and earnings season and it's like."
"20811200","20812540"," Also ready for this. "
"20813640","20814700"," Intel does not."
"20815040","20816560"," Their call is at five PM."
"20817420","20819020"," They're always so mysterious. "
"20819020","20821680"," You know, it's like, it's like, oh, we're going to change."
"20821840","20824860"," We're going to announce earnings last last week, the last day."
"20826020","20829780"," So Intel doesn't look like they report until five PM. "
"20831800","20833400"," Oh, let me see here."
"20833700","20835520"," Now that's their calls at five PM."
"20838400","20843660"," It doesn't say what time the that says the five calls at five PM. "
"20844840","20847500"," And I don't know if the numbers come out at four."
"20848060","20849780"," We'll listen closely to financial."
"20850300","20855000"," The major changes to its app store and other services for consumers in Europe. "
"20855440","20857040"," Our Steve Kovac is here with the details."
"20857060","20857860"," What's this all about?"
"20857860","20859660"," Well, yeah, there goes the wall guarded at least."
"20859760","20864600"," The call is at five PM as well, but. "
"20868360","20870800"," But I don't two times the people in back."
"20875920","20879380"," So now it's not saying what time they actually give the numbers."
"20879620","20880560"," The numbers are going to matter. "
"20881300","20882120"," We'll listen."
"20882280","20883560"," I'll listen in closely here."
"20883600","20886220"," I'm going to leave financial juice up. "
"20886220","20892680"," Maybe they can give us a an idea here on if we at least get the numbers at four PM."
"20894060","20898120"," If they don't, if you want, I can leave the chat."
"20898380","20902400"," I can leave the stream up if they don't until five. "
"20903720","20911800"," So if you're trading Visa and IMTC, you can at least check in and watch the price action."
"20914160","20916980"," So I will leave the stream up today until five PM."
"20917240","20919300"," I'll stop back in around five PM. "
"20919740","20921300"," If anything else happens."
"20926320","20929400"," So the 45 4900 pin is real."
"20930720","20933920"," There is a question here after the bell. "
"20935440","20940220"," If there'll be some resistance on SPX or spy."
"20941100","20943000"," Due to the 4900 pin."
"20944300","20950980"," Even if you get a good report from Visa and IMTC. "
"20951720","20956420"," There's a little bit more room above here to 4910."
"20957320","20958400"," For a squeeze."
"20958880","20962000"," So if you're looking for a trade, if you're looking for a trade here. "
"20963140","20966340"," After the bell, it would be right here to."
"20967720","20976720"," 49 on on on on spy 490.24. This is where the SPX pin is right here on our one."
"20979620","20982460"," Now you get you guys following me on this. "
"20982560","20988000"," So whatever we would have whatever my point here is that by four 15 PM."
"20988360","20991580"," We should pull back if they give the numbers at four."
"20991900","20994500"," We should pull back whatever whatever winning. "
"20995800","21000260"," Visa and let's say IMTC and and Visa has a great."
"21001060","21004280"," Our reports that all that should come back to the pin."
"21005520","21008540"," So I would be wary of trading Visa and. "
"21010100","21013080"," I NTC synthetically into tomorrow."
"21013480","21015100"," If they have good reports."
"21016140","21017720"," That would all come back. "
"21017960","21020360"," It's possible to come back even on the bell."
"21020600","21023860"," So let's say spoons is crank it in the morning."
"21023860","21025360"," It could pull down by the open. "
"21025820","21028520"," So I'll just be wary Visa can still run."
"21028780","21035520"," I NTC can still run if they're bullish, but it might that might not translate well to the cues or"
"21035520","21038560"," to SPX or spy."
"21041300","21048360"," And this sucks to the early MOC imbalances 21 million to the by side. "
"21048640","21051100"," Now that does change as time progresses."
"21052220","21056280"," So slight buying into the close here today."
"21057540","21058860"," Expectations for tomorrow. "
"21060800","21063100"," Is that 10 to 4900?"
"21064900","21066780"," So what would I say to you guys?"
"21066880","21068220"," What expectations for tomorrow?"
"21068380","21069780"," I'm going to give them to you right now."
"21070220","21077960"," If we get bad reports from Visa and IMTC, I would be interested in buying a dip on the open"
"21077960","21078500"," tomorrow."
"21079340","21082000"," If we close today at 4900. "
"21082540","21088060"," I would expect us to open flat and begin to sell into the weekend."
"21088800","21091760"," So is there a trade to the upside for tomorrow?"
"21092360","21093540"," I wouldn't take one."
"21093840","21098920"," It might go up, but the but the you don't have an edge here going up as my point. "
"21099420","21104740"," So I would be sitting on my hands today at 415 on the indexes."
"21105780","21109680"," I would be long personally on IMTC and Visa."
"21110880","21112660"," Well, I and T or Visa. "
"21112980","21118960"," I like the idea of an outside the money strangle."
"21120260","21126220"," And on Visa, I like the idea of possibly some zero date call."
"21126480","21127060"," Well, that's zero date. "
"21127100","21128440"," Their next expiry calls."
"21129560","21131160"," Now, that's all gambling lot."
"21131300","21131700"," Oh shit. "
"21132480","21133160"," That's it."
"21133340","21135340"," That's not like, Hey, you should be trading this."
"21135540","21141780"," If anything, you should not ever be trading zero dates on earnings calls. "
"21145060","21152920"," Now for spy, at least I would be sitting on my hands and on the open tomorrow looking for where"
"21152920","21153820"," price is."
"21154340","21161960"," If price is up at that 4900, I'd really like to sell the sell the sell the open to the"
"21161960","21162720"," closing bell."
"21162720","21166200"," As that gamma wears off into the end of the week. "
"21169250","21176010"," Now, if we open on poor returns or poor ER calls on Visa and IMTC."
"21176610","21180570"," And you see a fall in SPX or queues."
"21181150","21183690"," I would love to buy that open tomorrow in the morning. "
"21188230","21189770"," There's a magnet here."
"21190110","21194810"," Like if we squeeze above that 4900, it should come back down as my point."
"21194810","21199010"," If we sell 4900, it should it should gravitate back up should. "
"21199910","21206570"," Is there market other market actions that could break through the 4900 or blast out, of course."
"21207470","21210150"," It's only as good as the paper that it's written on."
"21212500","21215380"," We do have some divergence here today. "
"21215380","21218880"," If you keep watching, we have failed to make new highs."
"21218880","21223920"," So just looking back here failure to make a high failure or failure to make a high failure to make"
"21223920","21226100"," a high another failure to make a high at the moment."
"21227000","21230360"," We have gamma some gamma rolling off into Friday. "
"21231140","21235400"," Could lend a little bit of weakness as we head into the weekend."
"21235400","21241480"," I'm not expecting even even my bearishness on spoons is not huge."
"21241540","21242960"," Let's take a look at something really quick. "
"21244780","21249520"," So when we talk about as someone said yesterday cap was bearish on Friday."
"21250160","21252260"," I am I was bearish and I'm still bearish."
"21252260","21255960"," Early marks on close imbalance 21 million to the buy side. "
"21257080","21261720"," But my bearishness is not probably the bearishness that you're thinking of."
"21263220","21266620"," So we're going to we're going to talk about that bearishness that I have."
"21267100","21273400"," So that bearishness we set up a put spread for the end of the month into January. "
"21273960","21274080"," Okay."
"21274920","21278560"," And we're going to talk about why I have that bearishness right now."
"21278560","21281780"," And we're going to talk about the context of that bearishness. "
"21282620","21284760"," But what it ultimately leads to."
"21286720","21288760"," I'm just going to take you over there really quick."
"21289420","21290360"," So right here, right?"
"21291220","21291840"," I am. "
"21292100","21292700"," Hold on here."
"21292940","21293560"," Clear all that out."
"21293980","21295280"," So I am bearish here. "
"21296580","21300820"," Only into the 19th, I believe, trading day."
"21301240","21304440"," Now, of course, we're going up in the face of that right now, right?"
"21304440","21313660"," And if you remember on Friday, I said to you, we'll build a put spread that accounts for"
"21313660","21317220"," this not happening here, right?"
"21317440","21318380"," For a squeeze higher."
"21319060","21324460"," So what we said was we'll build a put spread for 490 down to 475. "
"21325820","21329880"," Into the 17th trading day of the month."
"21330080","21333180"," Now I'm still looking for that roll down here."
"21333180","21335320"," Into the end of the month here. "
"21335480","21337380"," But I'm still not that bearish."
"21337420","21340740"," I'm actually looking for a lot much larger trade."
"21342420","21345800"," Into the 14th of February up here. "
"21346200","21347920"," I'm also going to show you briefly."
"21349100","21351480"," And the X and their seasonality."
"21351860","21354960"," And they weren't expected to have that major pullback. "
"21355240","21358500"," Their pullback was more of like a sideways action."
"21358860","21359580"," See it back here."
"21360100","21362920"," Now they've traded way out of that range at this point. "
"21362920","21367840"," This actually looks like tech could trade sideways at this point."
"21368560","21371480"," Currently, at least, or if there is a pullback."
"21372920","21377460"," You would see something like a down move and then a ricochet back up. "
"21377680","21382660"," Or the amplification to the upside on their seasonality chart."
"21383860","21385760"," For four cues, at least."
"21386820","21388560"," Let me switch back over here. "
"21389380","21390240"," So currently."
"21392720","21393960"," You're always beard up."
"21394480","21397580"," It checks the hot guy calendar. "
"21398320","21400920"," I got to set that hot guy calendar up by the way."
"21402520","21407120"," So for me, at least, there's a pin here at 4900 heading into Friday."
"21408540","21412000"," I'm looking to trade Friday's open. "
"21412680","21415880"," If we're up high selling, if we're down low buying."
"21416650","21420820"," Now, as we enter into the close tomorrow, there should be some of that gamma rolling off."
"21420940","21425100"," So we could get a nice bloodbath as we head into the four PM hour. "
"21425680","21428060"," It all depends on positioning tomorrow."
"21429720","21432620"," I'm fascinated here to see what happens on."
"21433700","21435360"," I and TC and V."
"21436640","21439620"," For after hours because so far. "
"21440520","21444520"," Most of these tickers have been in line, generally speaking."
"21444520","21448940"," If they're selling into big tech or big names."
"21449980","21452760"," They continue to sell in this earnings season. "
"21453080","21458780"," And generally, if they're leading up running the stock price up into these earnings."
"21459500","21465540"," As long as they give a whiff of neutrality in their reports and their guidance."
"21466580","21471020"," The stock price will go up for some kind of monetization. "
"21471660","21476660"," Unlike previous earnings seasons, it's been pretty consistent so far."
"21477340","21479940"," We haven't had anything crazy happen at this point for expectations."
"21483440","21488740"," You guys have any questions off the top of your head in these last 10 minutes. "
"21488740","21490440"," If you have any questions for me, let me know."
"21495380","21499960"," Also, Stimpy, if you're out there listening to the broadcast right now."
"21499960","21501860"," I just sent you an email. "
"21502360","21505880"," If you can check that email and get back to me, I would appreciate it."
"21507280","21508440"," Oh, crude oil."
"21510700","21511760"," Sorry about that. "
"21511940","21512580"," Thirst and I apologize."
"21512980","21513940"," I didn't see you earlier, man."
"21515720","21518520"," I want you guys to tell you guys something. "
"21518860","21521500"," So I have a real time chat."
"21523000","21525860"," Directly on YouTube and Twitch."
"21528640","21532320"," That I can see and then, but I don't have it open at the moment. "
"21532600","21533070"," I haven't."
"21533520","21534140"," I have a."
"21537750","21540410"," Then I have a chat on."
"21541610","21542470"," Stream labs. "
"21544830","21547610"," And that chat on stream labs."
"21548490","21550010"," Is sometimes delayed."
"21550770","21554570"," So if you were asking me earlier, I may have just missed it due to a delay. "
"21554570","21555430"," So I apologize."

"21581370","21581730"," All right."
"21581730","21582030"," Whatever. "
"21582330","21584610"," Cameras are estimated revenue at 15 spot."
"21584790","21585250"," One one billion."
"21585250","21586530"," I might be overheated. "
"21587250","21587930"," He's Sony."
"21588190","21590650"," The Sony a 6000 is a great camera."
"21590990","21593890"," But if I got the heat cranking, it does not like it. "
"21594610","21595670"," We have any drawings."
"21595950","21597050"," We had zero drawings here."
"21600230","21601310"," Oh, Jesus. "

"21603390","21603650"," See."
"21604590","21605530"," Let's take a look at it. "
"21609350","21611130"," Let's have a look at CL."
"21611130","21617810"," We have some beautiful, beautiful consolidation down here in a 30 minute basis."
"21618450","21619010"," Gorgeous. "
"21620470","21621710"," Absolutely stunning."
"21622350","21624990"," Always like to see this price action in a 30 minute."
"21625570","21626870"," 30 minute basis. "
"21627310","21628050"," Always love it."
"21628770","21630970"," We're coming into right now."
"21631650","21633810"," Your first resistance right here. "
"21634290","21636130"," We have never made an attempt at this."
"21637590","21638070"," Okay."
"21638350","21638870"," Right there. "
"21639010","21639230"," Bam."
"21640750","21642650"," That's your first resistance right there."
"21642710","21645890"," Your second resistance to the upside is right here. "
"21646910","21647770"," Right up there."
"21648230","21649450"," That's your second target."
"21651050","21652190"," Your next target. "
"21652430","21653410"," The big boy is up here."
"21653510","21654470"," Let's just get right on it."
"21654710","21656350"," That's your that's your real target up there. "
"21658570","21659530"," 89 40."
"21660050","21661810"," You got some minor ones down here."
"21661810","21663330"," It's like one here here and here. "
"21663750","21664910"," We could put these in."
"21666350","21667790"," This one here should be red."
"21669690","21671530"," That's your actual target right there. "
"21672490","21674210"," And then we got another one right here."
"21675170","21676950"," All this is gorgeous by the way."
"21677050","21677990"," This is a 30 minute basis. "
"21680800","21682040"," Looks great right here."
"21682220","21683800"," All this right here is all nice."
"21685460","21686400"," Inversed in shoulders. "
"21687080","21688440"," Price underneath the daily trigger."
"21689200","21690780"," Daily trigger flattening out right here."
"21690920","21692180"," That's nice to see right there. "
"21692660","21693580"," Flattening of the daily trigger."
"21694260","21695020"," That all looks good."
"21695020","21697320"," We're now testing right now. "
"21699220","21703460"," Resistance at on the one minute or excuse me the weekly trigger."
"21703460","21707820"," And we have an extension possible to 78 31."
"21708260","21710000"," So you might get a little bit more right here. "
"21710780","21717020"," I am going to expect a pullback though on this right here."
"21717760","21718380"," I'm going to show you this."
"21720980","21721500"," Now. "
"21722260","21726040"," Even though I'm saying this because price is above is a lot."
"21726160","21727300"," I'm going to say a couple things here."
"21727440","21729140"," I got to be taxable in how I say this. "
"21731020","21733180"," On a light sweet crew right."
"21734380","21736040"," As long as price remains."
"21736780","21738540"," Get your pencils and paper out. "
"21739660","21741040"," I'll just write this in here for you."
"21743900","21745480"," As long as price."
"21750130","21751490"," Remains above. "
"21754310","21754990"," 75."
"21757470","21758670"," Point 39."
"21763150","21764870"," I am a buyer. "
"21765750","21766710"," Does that work?"
"21770350","21772370"," Long as price remains above."
"21774130","21775310"," 79 35."
"21775950","21776390"," I am a buyer. "
"21776730","21777530"," And what does that mean?"
"21777810","21779970"," That means that you would expect a pullback."
"21780950","21783690"," And an attack of the monthly trigger."
"21784090","21784230"," Okay. "
"21785050","21785790"," Right there."
"21787470","21788710"," And that's it."
"21790390","21792930"," I would expect a pullback from there. "
"21794810","21797910"," Down believe it or not to the daily trigger."
"21798390","21799510"," You might go right there."
"21800050","21801750"," And then they're right there. "
"21801890","21802030"," Okay."
"21804010","21806030"," But even saying that."
"21806830","21808350"," I'm going to expect one. "
"21811370","21811930"," Three."
"21812090","21814910"," And then you get the break higher to attack right there."
"21815010","21815170"," Okay. "
"21816270","21817990"," I'm going to show you how this works right here."
"21817990","21818790"," You're going to get price."
"21819350","21820750"," It's going to blast up. "
"21821210","21822210"," Come down."
"21822430","21824130"," Rest on the hourly trigger."
"21824930","21826110"," You'll get a rejection. "
"21826670","21828710"," And in a week or so."
"21828730","21829070"," One."
"21829730","21829930"," Two. "
"21829930","21832510"," You'll get that break higher right there."
"21833090","21833630"," Right."
"21833890","21834130"," Three. "
"21834550","21835230"," Four."
"21835670","21836090"," Five."
"21836590","21840870"," You'll then be above the daily trigger and the weekly trigger. "
"21840870","21842970"," And that will give you the momentum that you need."
"21843670","21845270"," To smash above."
"21846310","21847890"," And now target. "
"21849010","21851430"," Your next level of 81."
"21851930","21852850"," From there."
"21853290","21859510"," Time to get in. "
"21859510","21861910"," And you're going to get an explosive move to the upside."
"21863990","21866070"," And you will then attack."
"21867550","21868730"," That one right there. "
"21869690","21870130"," Okay."
"21871090","21873970"," And so on and so forth down the line right there."
"21874030","21874210"," Okay. "
"21874390","21875170"," Just get what I'm saying there."
"21875430","21877410"," And then you're going to come back down over here."
"21877630","21881090"," And you're going to get that one right there. "
"21882130","21883610"," And then that one right there."
"21883950","21884610"," And there you go."
"21885130","21886050"," That's how you get there. "
"21886050","21890030"," Do you see though that you need the consolidation period down here."
"21890250","21891890"," And the daily trigger to catch up."
"21892110","21892330"," Okay. "
"21892770","21894070"," So let's just watch that."
"21894790","21897170"," This will actually take more time believe it or not."
"21897850","21899530"," The way I'm scaling it. "
"21899610","21900550"," It's going to take more time."
"21900810","21903230"," But you basically get the gist right here."
"21903410","21903490"," Right. "
"21903950","21904890"," This this one right."
"21905150","21906150"," This bad boy right here."
"21906310","21906450"," Whoop. "
"21907710","21910150"," I probably chart this out in a better way."
"21912150","21912870"," One here."
"21914470","21916230"," But a more meaningful way. "
"21920610","21922270"," Slide all that over right there."
"21924730","21928570"," If I had like an extra half an hour or so I'd do a better job of this."
"21932110","21933890"," Move that over right there. "
"21935090","21936110"," Something like that."
"21936350","21936450"," Okay."
"21938210","21938730"," Bam. "
"21939170","21939610"," Bam."
"21940190","21940370"," Bam."
"21940370","21940630"," Bam. "
"21940790","21940930"," Bam."
"21941570","21946170"," You need time here for momentum to carry you up there."
"21946370","21946510"," Okay. "
"21947670","21952790"," Now if you're if you have the hourly trigger here and as long as we stay above that and the"
"21952790","21953290"," daily trigger."
"21953850","21955710"," And this little consolidation here."
"21955710","21957170"," I am pretty bullish here. "
"21957890","21961670"," Ultimately the price target that I have here as long as we do not break below."
"21961670","21967890"," $1.073.37 price target upside $89 on spy."
"21968810","21969910"," Oh, so that's fine. "
"21970530","21971350"," On CL."
