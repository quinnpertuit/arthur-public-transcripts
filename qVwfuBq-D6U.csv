"qVwfuBq-D6U","144000","147000"," when I first started that Twitter account."

"qVwfuBq-D6U","166000","175000"," Sweden. Lucky, lucky."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","175000","179000"," All right, little big bear. Yeah, you know, it's been weird trying to,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","179000","184000"," I've asked my wife to help me with fate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","184000","188000"," Not like trying to figure out who people are because you'll see your regular name."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","188000","192000"," I'm not tying it to your Twitter name."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","192000","195000"," I gave like a list of shout outs to the day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","195000","200000"," So I hope that you guys can hear, you guys are here and recall you out without, you know,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","200000","203000"," letting everyone know who you are so you can keep your anonymity on the internet,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","203000","205000"," which is always a good thing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","205000","213000"," Don't be listening to people tell you that it's good to be giving up your anonymity on the internet."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","213000","217000"," Good morning, Betty Mac."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","217000","224000"," Alfie right on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","224000","231000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","231000","234000"," So, you know, things should, it's interesting."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","234000","246000"," I was in a discord where there were rumors floating around that because of lockdowns or new lockdowns that all the big bank traders were ready to try."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","246000","253000"," We're ready to trade at a moment's notice over the Christmas into New Year's holiday in case the market crashed."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","253000","260000"," Of course, the rumor started from one of the biggest bears out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","260000","263000"," Happy Sunday, Troy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","263000","266000"," Alex, good morning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","266000","273000"," Yeah, we could do that right now. Let's start with Alex's or Andy's Alex. Let's start with Andy's."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","273000","278000"," Tweet, if you want, before we get into anything, we can briefly talk about that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","278000","285000"," We could get that started so that people can go back and review it later."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","285000","293000"," So Andy Constan put out a tweet about a topic that is sometimes difficult to understand."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","293000","298000"," We'll switch over real quick and I'll show this to you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","298000","304000"," So, and I'm going to try to, I'm going to try to make this simple. Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","304000","309000"," So every quarter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","309000","314000"," Let's bring this back down to September."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","314000","320000"," It's actually pretty good right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","320000","329000"," So this is OPEX, right? This is OPEX right here back in September."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","329000","335000"," And you have to plan for your quarter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","335000","340000"," You plan for your monthly OPEXs and then you plan for your yearly outlook, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","340000","344000"," Plan for your quarterly OPEXs."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","344000","352000"," And you all know that the biggest trader out there are the dealer, let's say like,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","352000","356000"," dealer's brokers, market makers, right? Market makers is the biggest out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","356000","360000"," Baywell, basically the biggest trader out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","360000","364000"," And then you've got dealers, brokers, you've got these big banks,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","364000","370000"," you've got GS and JPM, some smaller players, MS and whatever."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","370000","375000"," And you've got these like billionaires like, or trillionaires, I guess, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","375000","380000"," Billionaire trillionaires out there like, who's one of them?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","380000","384000"," I'm always making fun of them on Twitter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","384000","389000"," I can, Carl Eikens, a big provider of liquidity in the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","389000","390000"," Morning Ted."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","390000","396000"," So you've got these guys out, you know, very rich, very powerful people"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","396000","404000"," that provide liquidity to banks and smaller banks, the big market players."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","404000","411000"," And, you know, every year every quarter, they're providing liquidity, basically, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","411000","415000"," And so let's say we're back here in September."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","415000","420000"," I think this is the 21st of September, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","420000","424000"," And we're looking towards, you've got, you know, you've got the dot plot for the Fed."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","424000","426000"," You've got all this yet end of year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","426000","431000"," You've got this trade that's wrapping up for the COVID trade, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","431000","436000"," The two year COVID trade from March of 2020, or whatever, however long that is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","436000","439000"," And you know that rates are possibly coming."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","439000","442000"," You know that the ramping up of tapering is possibly coming."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","442000","444000"," You have all these unknowns."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","444000","449000"," Even though people know things, you're like, Oh, JPM, or excuse me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","449000","453000"," JPOW is a friend of the banks, you know, banks are, they're not friends."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","453000","454000"," They work together."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","454000","456000"," Sometimes, sometimes they don't."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","456000","461000"," But, and they're always, and there's always powerful people trying to take each other's money too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","461000","464000"," We know this from past history."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","464000","470000"," So, at any rate, when you're planning out, you know, they're planning out this month right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","470000","478000"," You'll know, you'll always hear about selling calls and buying puts, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","478000","482000"," So delta new, being delta neutral hedging."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","482000","487000"," And as you're heading into some unknown events coming up in the future."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","487000","490000"," And you're at a certain, certain point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","490000","495000"," And you want to start hedging, you'll end up selling calls above, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","495000","499000"," And you'll, you'll buy hedging puts below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","499000","501000"," And they did it actually back here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","501000","503000"," This is actually when it really started heavy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","503000","506000"," It's that ended up starting here in November 5th."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","507000","512000"," There were some massive, there was some massive hedging put on the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","512000","522000"," And so at the same time, or anyways, when they, when they start to hedge over here, these big banks, they hedged down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","522000","526000"," And they sold calls above, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","526000","533000"," And there's, you know, they're selling these calls, you've got big money putting, or putting the money up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","533000","538000"," To create these, these tools, I guess."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","538000","542000"," And these printed down below here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","542000","546000"," So you've got all these, you bought these cheap puts that are way down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","546000","553000"," And this is what this guy's talking about in basic terms is these things, these hedges ended up printing down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","553000","557000"," At four, four forty five, or forty five hundred basically."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","557000","561000"," And no more hedging came in down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","561000","564000"," And that was part of his point was that this can go either way."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","564000","570000"," Is, let's say we're down below here and you see another wave of heavy hedging down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","570000","578000"," And these, these big banks like JPM, when they're buying these hedges and they're, they're selling calls up here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","578000","581000"," And then you have to understand how rich these banks are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","581000","586000"," These banks want to hang tight for just a second."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","592000","599000"," These banks want to make money on their hedges and they want to make money on calls, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","599000","603000"," So if they're going to, they're going to hedge, they're going to call hedge too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","603000","609000"," And so when they're down here and they get this print down here, let's say JPM was the one that did it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","609000","612000"," And now they want to take the upside."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","612000","615000"," Go into hedging above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","615000","620000"," And so they're always buying like a, like me, like how I trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","620000","630000"," They're always taking the other side of the, not always, but one thing they're looking for down here is if there's more hedging, we can go deeper."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","630000","634000"," And this is that, that whiplash effect that everyone's talking about, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","634000","643000"," So they continue to hedge down here and how the, how this trade can go wrong in the future for the market specifically as if there was more hedging down here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","643000","645000"," We would actually continue to go down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","645000","648000"," This is how market crashes happen, huge corrections happen."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","648000","650000"," If there's more risk in the future."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","650000","660000"," Now, if the hedging hedging is not put down or placed down here, these same banks, they're going to want to buy those calls back that they sold, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","660000","661000"," Above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","661000","665000"," Because those calls that they sold above are now worthless."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","665000","668000"," They're worth like one penny, ten cents."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","668000","670000"," They can get them on a discount."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","670000","676000"," They've already collected the money on selling those calls to fo-mobiles."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","676000","680000"," And now they can buy them back for pennies on the dollar."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","680000","683000"," Does that make sense to any of you guys out there?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","683000","690000"," So if there's no more hedging down here, the expectation would be as we head into the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","690000","692000"," We're already down to somewhere down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","692000","696000"," There's some potential to dip back down once more to 4,500."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","696000","697000"," We'll get into that too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","698000","702000"," To buy more, believe it or not, not because the market's crashing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","702000","708000"," But just to get the best price on call hedging above as we head into January."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","708000","710000"," Now, of course, this trade can go wrong."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","710000","713000"," If one were down and there's always risk when we're down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","713000","715000"," So there's covering of shorts down here as well."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","715000","717000"," You take your profit on your shorts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","717000","720000"," You've taken the profit on that put hedging."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","720000","722000"," And there's no more put hedging put on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","722000","725000"," This is the implied theory of what this guy's talking about."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","725000","731000"," Because now they're going to buy the upside as a call hedge to the future."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","731000","737000"," Now, if there's no more put hedging put on, the implication would be that these big banks"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","737000","739000"," and these guys can move markets."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","739000","744000"," They say they can't, like, that the market makers move the market so they're biggest"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","744000","745000"," better out there, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","745000","750000"," But in reality, and you could call it dealers in market makers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","750000","753000"," In this context, they're slightly interchangeable."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","754000","758000"," But the point would be that if no more hedging comes in that they, not only do they have"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","758000","761000"," to, to be dealt with neutral, but they want to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","761000","764000"," These guys make money on both sides of the trade no matter what."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","764000","765000"," This is why they're banks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","765000","767000"," This is why they're rich."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","767000","771000"," Yeah, they do it to move it in their favor, but they don't ever want to lose a trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","771000","772000"," Sometimes they do lose a trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","772000","776000"," So let's say this is how banks get, this is how banks go blow up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","776000","782000"," When you look at 2007, there were some other problems with mortgages being rewrapped."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","782000","784000"," A bunch of different times, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","784000","790000"," You're selling shit packages of mortgages that are rated at AAA."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","790000","794000"," But let's say I didn't know that as another bank."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","794000","795000"," Excuse me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","795000","798000"," I'd say I didn't know that as another bank."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","798000","800000"," What was going on in the background?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","800000","803000"," And so I don't think we're going to hedge again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","803000","805000"," That some other bank's going to step in an edge."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","805000","810000"," I'm going to end up buying those calls back that I sold way back here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","810000","815000"," In November and probably sold some back here in September."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","815000","820000"," So they're going to buy these calls for dirt dirt cheap."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","820000","821000"," Above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","821000","824000"," And that trade should in the covering of shorts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","824000","827000"," So you've got the covering of shorts heading into the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","827000","832000"," You've got you want to make the market look like dog crap."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","832000","837000"," You want to you want to I want to make you as retail and small banks think that we're going to crash."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","837000","848000"," Well, I don't want anyone out there knowing that we're going to bring the market back up because I want discounts into January and March on calls above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","848000","855000"," So this is interesting too, because there were some 480 C's out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","855000","861000"," From the feud from I think it's from there were from January or March."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","861000","865000"," That on Friday disappeared from the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","865000","875000"," A ton of them. And so the thought process is that JPM bought those back and removed them from the market that they have them."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","875000","891000"," And that there's a good chance that we're going to move up into a very strong January and possibly into March. Now, that whole positive can go wrong. Right. There's, of course, there are things that can change between now and the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","891000","900000"," We don't know if another bank knows something that we don't know or JPM doesn't know that the implication is that's JPM and that GS is in on this as well."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","900000","905000"," Now, maybe MS knows something that they those two guys don't know right but that mess has been very bullish."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","905000","918000"," Anyways, you have to understand the thought or the message that's put out to from the large banks to the smaller banks to the hedge funds to everyone below them right down to retail."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","919000","925000"," There's a message that's put out there so that they are always on top. If you're the top guy out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","925000","940000"," You always want to stay the top guy right top woman, whatever I'm using the mail mail mail possessive but in reality, you know, call whatever you want."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","940000","947000"," Thanks for, for, for, for, is it fron trail pine."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","947000","958000"," So, and that's the implication that this guy's talking about on a basic sense is that you're selling, you're selling calls above and you're buying hedge below and that flips."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","958000","967000"," If no more hedging comes in, they're going to do what they're going to sell their hedge to unsuspecting FOMO bears."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","967000","972000"," They do it to FOMO bulls and they do it to FOMO bears. They're going to pump out there that the world is burning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","972000","980000"," This is the general practice. They're going to pump. It doesn't, of course, the market can swing up and down and get more amplified on the downside or the upside."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","980000","986000"," But generally speaking, how this market runs, we know that our markets generally go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","986000","994000"," I know that I could put up a composite index chart for you that's gone back to the 1800s and it's, it's goes straight up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","995000","1006000"," So that, that's the assumption. Over time, our markets go up. That's what, that's what happens. Even with the great depression thrown in, you, you still have our market eventually going up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1006000","1011000"," That leads back to an Elliott wave stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1011000","1021000"," You know, we, yes, we go down, but our markets generally go up. So the point that I'm trying to make too is that they will eventually."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1021000","1029000"," Pedge the other way, right? Eventually you end up hedging, heading up instead of heading down and they're going to want those calls to print."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1029000","1038000"," So my point to, and that's when you hear, when you see, when we see market meltups, when you see bulls being scared."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1038000","1048000"," Matter of fact, I'm horrible at trading meltups. It's one of the things that I'm really bad at. The trading that's been going on in the market since November is some of the best."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1049000","1056000"," Well, not even, yes, no, since let's call it August. This, this area right here is some of the best trading I've had."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1056000","1062000"," In a long time, and that's because I can somewhat define what's happening."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1062000","1069000"," You will sometimes break out of these support and resistances, but in reality."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1069000","1075000"," It's defined when we melt up and let's say we melt up, I mean, we can, we can look at it, right, where we don't have any."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1075000","1081000"," We know that we have times where we just crank, right? We're melting, or we melt right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1081000","1087000"," Like when we're down here and I'm buying this down here, when we get to somewhere up in here, I'm fine."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1087000","1093000"," When we start to move up, I start to question, I want to see some kind of small pullback."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1093000","1099000"," But when we start melting up in here, and my stuff starting to already print, I tend to just day trade this stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1099000","1103000"," Like I'll take a nice long one to three month call option back here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1103000","1109000"," But once they start to print for me, I start taking more risky and more risky as we get up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1109000","1120000"," And once I'm getting on my prints, though, I stop trading longer dated stuff, and I start just day trading because this stuff here, I don't trade well in."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1120000","1126000"," When we're doing, you know, these moves like this, these are easy for me to trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1126000","1131000"," They're somewhat defined, and the end result is somewhat we go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1131000","1134000"," That's our markets going up point that I'm trying to make to you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1134000","1148000"," So even when we're over here correcting, and you see this larger, I know that a lot, I can already tell you guys, there are bears out here saying that this is the larger, the larger move down below, or here and here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1148000","1150000"," This is actually a larger expanding wedge."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1150000","1154000"," It's not too expanding wedges like I showed you the other day on Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1154000","1158000"," There's this larger wedge and we're going down here at the 4300 or whatever."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1158000","1160000"," Nothing's really showing that in the background."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1160000","1164000"," But anyway, when we're trading like this, it's more defined."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1164000","1168000"," And when these moves are finished, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1168000","1170000"," Whatever we're doing in here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1170000","1174000"," When these moves are finished, they tend to resolve to the upside."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1174000","1176000"," They tend not to resolve to the downside."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1176000","1182000"," Well, when we're making these moves, let's say we start to correct and we continue to correct down over time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1183000","1190000"," The relief rallies tend to, they tend to resolve with a relief rally, even if we're trading down over the next two years."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1190000","1200000"," So let's say we took the book, The Bear Thesis, probably would be the best times for, I'll probably make more money during a corrective year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1200000","1206000"," Then I ever will on one of our better years, like 2020."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1206000","1208000"," In all honesty."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1208000","1214000"," In all honesty, I made more money in the 2020 crash in March than I ever did in my career."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1214000","1216000"," Overall, that was the most money I'd made."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1216000","1220000"," Because these are defined trading channels to an extent."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1220000","1222000"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1222000","1224000"," Hey, Steve, good morning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1224000","1226000"," Good morning, Jay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1226000","1228000"," Good morning, PE."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1228000","1235000"," So that's what this guy is talking about is that this will find some resolution at some point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1235000","1238000"," Now, there are other things you need to look at in our market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1238000","1241000"," You have to look at where support is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1241000","1248000"," And when we start breaking through support areas, there are some hard areas that are difficult to break through."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1248000","1259000"," I guess the thought process from some market bears would be that we broke through some critical support on Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1260000","1262000"," We did climb back up on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1262000","1265000"," We did climb back up at the end of the close."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1265000","1270000"," This little move right here is 4619.25."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1270000","1276000"," 4620 was a critical support for some bears out there in Maryland."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1276000","1283000"," Saying that, you know, if we close below that number and surprisingly, it's between it's by .75 cents."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1283000","1286000"," So they kind of leave you hanging into this week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1286000","1290000"," Because their point is if we break if we close below this number."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1290000","1294000"," That the next move down is to .4500."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1294000","1301000"," And to be honest, I really don't care if we head down to .4500 this week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1301000","1303000"," This isn't really a concern for me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1303000","1305000"," And you can actually see back here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1305000","1309000"," We did that once before we were at .4590."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1310000","1317000"," But there is some significant support at this .4600 level."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1317000","1319000"," It's not to be taken lightly."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1319000","1322000"," You know, up here, there's not as much support when you're up in these levels."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1322000","1324000"," There's not this is some freefall and stuff up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1324000","1333000"," But you have to understand that the deeper we go, right, the walls become bigger and bigger, bigger, bigger."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1333000","1337000"," Even down at like that 390 level."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1337000","1345000"," So if you could break through that, if you had a World War three and the United States was gone, that wall would probably still stay up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1345000","1348000"," That's how deep some of these walls are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1348000","1350000"," As we correct, move down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1350000","1357000"," And I think that that bear thought would be as we as we move into futures tonight."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1357000","1363000"," Into a low liquidity environment into Monday because the market's going to slow down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1363000","1368000"," That bears could take over for one last push down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1368000","1370000"," I think you're going to move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1370000","1375000"," I think the probability is that you're going to see the weakness into Thursday and Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1375000","1378000"," You'll see some we will let's call it Wednesday night."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1378000","1379000"," Not Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1379000","1382000"," Excuse me because Friday were closed Wednesday night."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1382000","1386000"," I would call it the end of day Wednesday into Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1386000","1390000"," You might see some more strength into next week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1390000","1398000"," But there could be some tail weakness into the 31st usually or the 31st 31st will be like a bear should be a bear Christmas."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1398000","1409000"," If any of you guys have losing stocks, stocks that are losing that you're invested in, you can do a wash sale into the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1409000","1411000"," That's the last day you can do it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1411000","1418000"," So you'll see investors trying to end the year on a positive note."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1418000","1427000"," You'll see investors that haven't closed out a stock or haven't like this is a good point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1427000","1435000"," You know that there's their hedge funds out there that want to see certain certain meme stocks, shit stocks, speculative stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1435000","1447000"," They want to see them close red and they're betting high risk betting that these stocks will close on the 31st in the red for a lot of investors."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1447000","1454000"," So that they sell out of their positions for the tax harvesting at the end of the year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1454000","1467000"," So there are still some players out there that are like, well, if I can pin our K, let's say, until end of year, there will be a ton of sellers in the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1467000","1476000"," And that's their hope and you'll see some stocks from now until the 31st that will go green again before the end of the year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1476000","1479000"," They don't want to destroy them any longer. They've destroyed them enough."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1479000","1484000"," And that's what that guy Marco was talking about from JPM."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1484000","1490000"," His point was that shorts have to cover at some point between now and the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1490000","1496000"," And not an all tickers, but they have to and a lot of tickers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1496000","1501000"," You can't, you want to beat up a stock, but let's say you beat up, let's let me make a better point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1501000","1513000"," Let's say you beat up RK until the 31st and you crush, you crush RK and I get you guys at the Kathy hate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1513000","1517000"," I understand the Kathy hate. I'm indifferent to most of that stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1517000","1523000"," I'm kind of my emotions really don't run on anything with the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1523000","1529000"," I mean, I get fear when I'm placing trades that are calculated risky."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1529000","1537000"," But like, so I have no thought on Kathy, but let's say they let's say they're snicker and laughing and about it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1537000","1540000"," Cause I sit in these rooms with guys that like snicker about it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1540000","1550000"," I understand the hate, but let's say they crush RK down to, I don't know, 10 bucks a 10 bucks a share on a ETF or something."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1550000","1555000"," You have to understand that those shorts will cover on the 31st and let's say like January one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1555000","1560000"," It is going to, it's going to be like GME in 2020."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1560000","1565000"," That yeah, that's or 2020 excuse me, 2021 in December."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1565000","1571000"," You're going to have a move that is sometimes uncalculable."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1571000","1573000"," How high they can go."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1574000","1582000"," Or they hold off on selling for these names since they want to sell losers for taxes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1582000","1587000"," No, so you'll see, we're going to talk about Apple if that's your question."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1587000","1594000"," I'm assuming this is geared towards Apple because Apple is looking very bearish right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1594000","1599000"," I think there's a couple of things we need to talk about heading into 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1600000","1609000"," So every year, you'll hear the pundits come out, you'll hear, you'll hear this astroturfing saying, this is where the trade is for the next year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1609000","1619000"," You'll pop into those stocks and find that they've already been pumped up and they'll sell to smaller, smaller players into strength."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1619000","1621000"," Into 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1621000","1624000"," There's a couple of things that never change."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1625000","1633000"," If big tech becomes tasty again, that will be the play again next year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1633000","1641000"," I know that none of you believe that, but when you start to see Apple at 900 or excuse me, Tesla at 900."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1641000","1647000"," Tesla at 750 maybe, maybe that takes until middle of springtime."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1647000","1652000"," But when you start to see those lower prices, they become tempting to investors."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1652000","1655000"," So I don't think a lot of tech is not going to get traded next year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1655000","1662000"," I think that they're telling you that it isn't, but that it will be traded next year, especially as the prices come down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1662000","1666000"," I think that there are, we're going to look at some stocks this morning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1666000","1670000"," We're going to start, we're going to chart out some stuff this morning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1670000","1680000"," I want to show you guys how to catch knives and I want to show you guys how to look for when it's good for you to decide to buy in."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1680000","1684000"," When you, what makes you feel comfortable to buy an Apple or a Tesla."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1684000","1689000"," So that you're happy even if the trade doesn't go your way."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1689000","1700000"," That you should sell, you know, you could sell calls in these investments to the key being an investor in the stock market is you want to buy where you like the price, where you're comfortable with the price."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1700000","1708000"," If it continues to get down, how to dollar cost average into whatever rock bottom would be in that stock and how to sell calls in that stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1708000","1711000"," To protect your investment as it goes down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1711000","1721000"," And then once it does bounce, let's say on the lowest support it can possibly have theoretically without there being fraud allegations or something you don't know."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1721000","1726000"," That you can then begin to sell puts on it as it moves up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1726000","1728000"," To make money on that investment."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1728000","1734000"," Now, let's get back to the thing though, the important thing we have to talk about."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1734000","1744000"," Okay, so what's the, what's this over here? Did you see that order Friday for Apple? It was like $7,000,000 order at 171. Yeah, not didn't see that order in Apple."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1744000","1749000"," You know, for all intents and purposes, Apple looks very bearish."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1749000","1754000"," I think I've spoken about this in the past."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1754000","1763000"," There was a couple points I wanted to make. First one would be that all these stocks that are under their 200 a moving averages, all they have to do is catch a bid."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1763000","1780000"," They can let an Apple fall. They can let a Tesla fall. They can let an Nvidia fall or Amazon fall. I think Amazon's already fallen a lot, but you can start to let some of the pressure off the mark off of these four or five stocks or holding up the market and then raise up the rest of the market just enough"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1780000","1797000"," that the indexes don't fall. Right. It's like one, you know, you're kicking out one crutch and then putting out your kicking out four crutches and you're starting to walk on your own."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1797000","1811000"," So Steve, I have to say something. I was posting on Twitter a lot. I posted a lot of that film with Daniel Day Lewis, where he drinks the milkshake of the other guy with that has oil in his fields."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1811000","1823000"," And I like the idea or I believe in the idea of a blow off top if we were to scream to straight vertical for another year or two."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1823000","1829000"," But I don't think you see the blow off top. They're trying to manipulate it right now. In my view."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1829000","1835000"," They're what they're trying to do is they're trying to knock all these stocks down below. It's like a house of it's like a house."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1835000","1842000"," It's like a house on a foundation of sticks and they're knocking every stick underneath."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1842000","1851000"," And they're leaving four sticks to hold the entire market up. Let's say, right? Like the apples of the big tech that's out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1851000","1865000"," And then they're going to slowly sell down the market over into 2022, 2023, while these cheaper stocks can raise up and eventually hit the bottom of that foundation of that house on stilts again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1865000","1875000"," And how would that look would be you'd trade sideways in the indexes and you wouldn't see the underneath part and you can I know that bears out there know this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1875000","1885000"," If you look at some of if you look at some of the composites of the stocks under the 200 a moving average, we are in a bear market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1885000","1888000"," The market is crashed in some respects."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1888000","1898000"," But the issue is when that has happened on the underlying how far can they go down those underlying stocks that make up our indexes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1898000","1900000"," They start to become."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1900000","1905000"," They start to become attractive again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1905000","1910000"," So what does that do all that money and all that volume that's left our market you hear on the news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1910000","1917000"," You've got all these bulls out there you've got all these big market players that have all their cash in the sidelines."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1917000","1921000"," They're just waiting to deploy it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1921000","1925000"," Well, the stock market underlying is starting to look attractive to these guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1925000","1929000"," So while you're being told on the one hand is a retail person the market's going to crash."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1929000","1932000"," They've what they've."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1932000","1937000"," What they've basically done is they had they've drank your milkshake."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1937000","1944000"," You know we're all looking at everything being overvalued and we're all saying I can't wait for that blow off top of the whole market crashes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1944000","1960000"," I'm going to short the entire thing and make bank in reality there they're robbing bears of that of that potential that shocked to our market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1960000","1973000"," Yeah, so that's the point I'm trying to make out there to a lot of bears is that they're robbing you guys of that market crash scenario and that's all we talk about right we all talk we all know that even I know that I know the markets week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1973000","1985000"," I'm a bull but I know the markets week I know that we I was anticipating some either some sort of blow off top or some some kind of scream to the top you know the bulls want to see the screams to the top I want to see the scream to the top."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1985000","1990000"," And that proves the bill to bear theory as well you'd see one straight vertical move up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1990000","1996000"," You'd see days where you know we're getting four five six percent on big stocks like Apple."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","1996000","2006000"," And then we'd blow off the top I think the market's so manipulated right now that they are not does this work out for everybody I don't know we don't know."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2007000","2021000"," They think it will you can see that they think it will because we have sold for profit all the underlying and specifically that that trade that a NASDAQ trade right you look at most of the stocks and NASDAQ and they're"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2022000","2025000"," not going to sell it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2025000","2027000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2027000","2042000"," So let's say we trade down Apple slowly you could take to those you could take those four big stock you could take you could take Apple and you could take Tesla and a couple others and you could trade down this market slowly from now from let's say now"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2042000","2048000"," or let's say let's say keep pumping into January March and then they just sell it down in the summer time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2048000","2063000"," Back up in summer time and to the end of summer right we let's say do it of course we are it doesn't matter either way you're not getting your market crash bears are bulls aren't getting their their blow off top."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2063000","2072000"," And while they're telling you not to buy these stocks that are under their 200 day they're probably accumulating all these stocks as we move forward."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2072000","2079000"," And so then what what's that next cycle right they'll already be in all these stocks that have been beaten up and knocked down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2079000","2091000"," You'll buy the mid top and then they'll run them up take profit and leave you back hold back holding the bags a couple years now a year or two from now or three years now and they'll take a year to sell it all down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2091000","2097000"," They did this with a prime example of this for any of you that are new traders."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2097000","2101000"," You can just look at our K arc G that was the trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2101000","2113000"," Well they think last year I remember them saying our K was a little a little top heavy but they point blank I remember there was carpet there was carpet or astroturfing last year saying this year's trade is the genome."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2113000","2126000"," You heard Kathy come out this week saying innovation or this past Friday I think or Thursday she said innovation stocks are value stocks now she's she's somewhat right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2126000","2137000"," She is and you know like everyone said the genome the genome and they said the AI and robotic trade was that was the trade for this year because they weren't run up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2137000","2146000"," And in reality they sold all those down to right that's they did they sold they sold all kinds of crazy stocks down this whole entire year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2146000","2153000"," So they will need to flatten and they will need to consolidate and they will become a move down the road."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2153000","2157000"," I don't know that all of it is all those trades are going to happen right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2157000","2165000"," We'll look at some good trades that are happening right now you guys know that biotech you guys all know out there that biotech has been on fire right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2165000","2174000"," I think if you guys follow you guys should be following a guy called at accounts blown up on Twitter I think it's at accounts blown up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2174000","2180000"," He is heavy into biotech right now for good reason."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2180000","2185000"," It's biotech's blown up and there's a biotech ETF we'll take a look at."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2185000","2187000"," There's a few things we're going to take a look at."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2187000","2190000"," We'll take a look at the oil trade heading into this year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2190000","2199000"," We'll take a look into there's some risky trades in emerging markets for 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2199000","2203000"," So there's an oil trade there's a biotech trade in 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2203000","2205000"," There's some good tech trades too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2205000","2211000"," There's some tech trades that I wouldn't have expected for 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2211000","2214000"," Seems like you got a day trade the next couple weeks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2214000","2223000"," Do you remember our G calls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2223000","2228000"," Yeah you should be bearish it's not that you can't be bearish or even bearish on specific stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2228000","2234000"," It's that you have to think from the aspect of."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2234000","2239000"," You have to think from the aspect of whatever the narrative out there is it's usually the opposite."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2239000","2244000"," The narrative of we're going to have this blow off top is what everyone's saying is going to happen."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2244000","2246000"," You have much smarter people than a more."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2246000","2249000"," It's much smarter people than I saw it there that are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2249000","2253000"," They want to keep all of your money they want to take all of retail's equity."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2253000","2255000"," They want to drain it out of the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2255000","2258000"," They want to drain the bears bears money out of the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2258000","2261000"," They want to drain a bull's mark money out of the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2261000","2265000"," That's their that's the plan is that they remove your money from the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2265000","2267000"," They don't want you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2267000","2268000"," Excuse me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2268000","2271000"," They don't want you to keep your Bitcoin money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2271000","2273000"," They don't want you to keep."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2273000","2277000"," You guys all let's say let's say you guys are all holding."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2277000","2281000"," GME at 300 they want to take all that away from you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2281000","2284000"," They want to take away all the money you made in Apple."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2284000","2285000"," They're not going to leave."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2285000","2289000"," I know that some of you guys out there think Apple's going to 500 or something stupid."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2289000","2293000"," But in reality they're going to they're going to turn you into bag holders at some point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2293000","2295000"," They do that intentionally."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2295000","2300000"," They want you to continue to buy this market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2300000","2302000"," Uranium had a nice little move this year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2302000","2306000"," I do think the Uranium trade is over myself."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2306000","2308000"," It's possible."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2308000","2311000"," I like the gold miners right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2311000","2314000"," I do and I don't like the gold trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2314000","2320000"," I don't like trading gold in general but those miners I like the copper miners."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2320000","2323000"," But those are a little top heavy right now as well."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2323000","2325000"," This is getting depressing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2325000","2330000"," It shouldn't get depressing because what you have to think about is they've done a pretty"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2330000","2335000"," good job of making a lot of stocks attractive for 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2335000","2337000"," So you should look at that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2337000","2341000"," You should look at Palantir today or Palantar."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2341000","2345000"," Patrick you shouldn't be depressed because."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2346000","2356000"," They've done a very good job of taking profit on a lot of stocks people like to trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2356000","2362000"," And it makes it attractive again to new investors."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2362000","2366000"," Makes it attractive to people that have taken profit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2366000","2370000"," To reinvest in there is billions."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2370000","2374000"," If not trillions on the sidelines right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2374000","2384000"," This whole year if you were to surmise what this year was it was a year of profit taking."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2384000","2387000"," Many people took money off the table."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2387000","2393000"," Many people that have been in the market since the Covid trade began the bottom of Covid trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2393000","2399000"," And prior call it the let's call it maybe like 2018 end of 2018."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2400000","2405000"," We had the crash and they got stuck in that they got stuck in that crash."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2405000","2409000"," And you had new buyers coming in in the bottom of 2020."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2409000","2416000"," Not the 2019 crash the March crash of 2020 which is just out of 2019."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2416000","2417000"," So."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2417000","2421000"," Yeah, the copper trade for me is a long trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2421000","2423000"," It's not something that would trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2423000","2425000"," It was something I would just accumulate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2426000","2432000"," You've got the you've got the well right now you've got our government saying they're going to put charging stations up everywhere."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2432000","2437000"," If you build the infrastructure for electric vehicles it's going to require copper."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2437000","2444000"," You know one thing when you're trading electric vehicles is it's sometimes easier to trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2444000","2449000"," The materials that are needed for any new tech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2449000","2453000"," Rather than the individual tech companies."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2454000","2459000"," That's what the banks do often that they'll remove the risk from which EV companies are going to get big."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2459000","2464000"," They might put their their their traders their boiler rooms in on it but."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2464000","2472000"," They make their money off of the what's what's what supplies any new tech that comes out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2472000","2474000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2474000","2476000"," That's possibly a chart bill for you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2476000","2478000"," If we can get around to it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2478000","2479000"," I just want to talk about that real quick."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2479000","2481000"," Get that all that stuff out of the way this morning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2481000","2484000"," We're already and we're kind of into this already for like 40 minutes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2484000","2488000"," I know that some people out there just want to get a move on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2488000","2490000"," So let's just talk real quick about the week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2490000","2491000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2491000","2495000"," This will be your couple of things you need to know about me for this upcoming week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2495000","2500000"," I will be trading the entire I'll be trading the entire week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2500000","2505000"," You might get if nothing goes crazy on Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2506000","2509000"," You might just get a pre recorded video."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2509000","2514000"," I am well, I will be with family."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2514000","2522000"," Celebrating the holiday and the they have Internet, but it's not great Internet."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2522000","2526000"," So I can record and upload."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2526000","2529000"," But I cannot go live."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2529000","2534000"," I don't think I could possibly get like a hotel room in a Marriott or something to go live."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2534000","2537000"," But if I were to go live, you wouldn't see you would just hear my voice."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2537000","2538000"," It's possible."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2538000","2540000"," I guess I could do a podcast or something."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2540000","2544000"," But I will be back to trade as well on the next week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2544000","2547000"," I'll be here this week and next week to trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2547000","2550000"," And so you'll have me most of the time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2550000","2554000"," I can only spend so much time with family like three, four days."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2554000","2555000"," I'm done."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2555000","2556000"," I don't know about all of you out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2556000","2558000"," I can't do a whole week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2558000","2561000"," Like three days tops by third day, fourth day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2561000","2564000"," I need out of there, usually, usually."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2564000","2567000"," And so I've got that going on for this weekend."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2567000","2570000"," You won't you won't see me this weekend."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2570000","2574000"," And so we'll just talk about what my expectations are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2574000","2578000"," So let's talk briefly about the economic calendar."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2578000","2583000"," You've got nothing coming up on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2584000","2587000"," Tuesday, not much, but it starts to get more aggressive as we head into."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2587000","2589000"," You got GDP on Wednesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2589000","2591000"," Thursday is really the big day for the week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2591000","2594000"," This is where some weakness in the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2594000","2596000"," Let's call it Wednesday to Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2596000","2605000"," It wouldn't surprise me to see a decent pushup on Monday into Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2605000","2611000"," And then call it some possible weakness end of day Tuesday into Wednesday, Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2612000","2616000"," And we've got the Christmas holiday on Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2616000","2621000"," Now you also have the president holding a presser on Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2621000","2628000"," It's kind of kind of scratching my head on the presser on Tuesday because what my assumption is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2628000","2631000"," It's the same presser that he had on Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2631000","2636000"," And he had that presser on Thursday saying everybody was going to die or whatever."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2637000","2639000"," I don't understand what he could say on Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2639000","2644000"," He's already or his people have already said that he's not going to do lockdowns."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2644000","2647000"," If I had to guess."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2647000","2654000"," This is an interesting thing for you guys understand is whenever I see a president doing this stuff,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2654000","2657000"," I think I feel like they're short the market or along the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2657000","2660000"," I always feel like it doesn't matter what the president is either."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2660000","2662000"," You know how it would happen with Trump."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2662000","2665000"," He would pump the market, dump the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2666000","2667000"," I think they all do it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2667000","2668000"," I don't trust any politician."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2668000","2670000"," And I don't trust most news stories."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2670000","2675000"," When I read a new story, I just read this new story this weekend that came out about."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2675000","2682000"," I think it was Bloomberg and New York Times put out that the work from home crowd is only going to grow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2682000","2684000"," It's not going to end."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2684000","2688000"," And my first thought is they only did this story to pump up zoom."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2688000","2693000"," Like literally, that's how disgusting our news is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2694000","2696000"," This goes across all news media."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2696000","2700000"," CNN was doing stories over the weekend."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2700000","2701000"," That didn't quite make sense."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2701000","2706000"," I in my view, all news outlets, all politicians."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2706000","2708000"," They're all greedy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2708000","2709000"," There's there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2709000","2710000"," It's all about money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2710000","2721000"," So whenever I read these stories, I think that in my mind, I'm always on the what are they really trying to do right now for the four against the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2721000","2726000"," Literally, that's what I think they're doing 100%."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2726000","2728000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2728000","2731000"," So we have Biden on Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2731000","2734000"," Maybe that introduces the weakness later in the day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2734000","2737000"," What time is that press or is that at 11 or one o'clock in the afternoon?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2737000","2742000"," So maybe we have an update on Monday and then we have some down days on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2742000","2750000"," I know some people are thinking, well, we'll burn the market down on Monday and then he'll smooth things over on Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2750000","2752000"," And then we'll what?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2752000","2755000"," We'll get more stress on the market on Wednesday, Thursday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2755000","2756000"," I doubt that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2756000","2757000"," I think you have an update on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2757000","2760000"," It's a fair possibility of it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2760000","2768000"," This is the time when we're down to just so you all know, the play right now for me is to accumulate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2768000","2775000"," Short and long dated calls to be long this market into January and March."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2775000","2777000"," The safety would be March."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2777000","2780000"," The money is probably in January."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2780000","2782000"," There'll be some weakness."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2782000","2785000"," I'm sure there'll be some weakness this week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2785000","2792000"," There'll be some weakness on next week on the 31st and then you'll see a boom in the markets, but."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2792000","2799000"," You can position now and it will still print in one of the safeties in this is to trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2799000","2802000"," I always love trading spreads this time of year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2802000","2811000"," I was up trading or buying spreads on the lows now and then just checking back on them in January or March."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2811000","2813000"," To see how they print."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2813000","2822000"," Yeah, there's always an agenda and that, you know, you become so I've become so callous about news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2822000","2829000"," Like I can't raise to like to be I just like to read comment sections and read it or how news was discussed."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2829000","2838000"," But now I realize that 99% of people are Main Street people and they have no idea."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2838000","2843000"," That that news is mostly geared towards our stock market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2843000","2846000"," Most of the news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2846000","2848000"," Yeah, I'm still hold it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2849000","2863000"," I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm chock full of stuff. I'm I'm chock full of stuff into end of year and into January and hopefully so here's the deal if I can get here's the deal."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2863000","2873000"," So tomorrow if we are weak tomorrow or later in the week or if we're weak on the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2873000","2876000"," So then start rolling into."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2876000","2878000"," Excuse me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2878000","2883000"," Into calls for January and March."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2883000","2888000"," Yeah, my my whole play is to buy these lows without a doubt."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2888000","2900000"," They've worked out of me and I sell the tops too so don't think I don't I don't short the market we and I made a post on Friday about that that there were places the last two months."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2901000","2906000"," To go long. And if you were to relatively look at all those."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2906000","2908000"," Shorts and longs."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2908000","2910000"," You would have been right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2910000","2916000"," Every single time on both ends to take the long and take the short."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2916000","2921000"," And even if let's say we were to have a market crash tomorrow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2921000","2922000"," I'm still up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2922000","2925000"," I can't you can't really lose trading like that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2925000","2927000"," And when you do lose."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2928000","2930000"," It's not significant."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2930000","2932000"," It's not it's not enough."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2932000","2935000"," It's not even a dent in the bucket."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2935000","2938000"," Let's look real quick at."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2938000","2941000"," Let's say they can bring the just show you guys this a little bit better here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2941000","2946000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2946000","2949000"," See this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2949000","2951000"," This is I'm trying to talk to you guys about here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2951000","2956000"," So you guys understand my point when we're coming out with this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2957000","2959000"," Let me get this going here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2959000","2960000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2960000","2962000"," So let's just briefly look here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2962000","2963000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2963000","2966000"," This is a point that I was trying to bring up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2966000","2971000"," On Twitter on Friday was."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2971000","2975000"," You know, if you had you kind of know."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2975000","2976000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2976000","2977000"," This is where I get scared trading."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2977000","2981000"," I have a hard time trading all of this as a bull."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2982000","2986000"," I take my money at some point and I run and then I have to wait to start trading the stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2986000","2990000"," But when you see us top right here, we start to sell down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2990000","2995000"," Back here, see this line here, this dotted line, this, this white line right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2995000","2996000"," We can turn these."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","2996000","3005000"," Turn these yellow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3005000","3010000"," Now these lines."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3011000","3014000"," This is where volatility is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3014000","3018000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3018000","3024000"," And like a slide ruler, can this, this grouping here is a slide ruler."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3024000","3029000"," It expands and contracts and it moves up and down over time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3029000","3030000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3030000","3034000"," Like it'll move where the market is as we're moving."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3034000","3039000"," So you can trade within these bounds as time passes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3039000","3041000"," This wasn't way up here back here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3041000","3045000"," When we didn't have, you know, when we didn't know what this stuff was going to happen,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3045000","3047000"," these were slightly lower."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3047000","3051000"," But when you're trading within these, within this volatility range, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3051000","3056000"," You've got a call wall above and a put wall below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3056000","3061000"," And when you're trading within these bounds, it's easy for you to take these trades,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3061000","3068000"," know where the, the walls are as we continue by the day and trade within that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3068000","3072000"," And you're, you're quite safe through this whole move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3072000","3076000"," You're quite safe when you're bouncing off top here and you know you can trade this down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3076000","3079000"," You know that you've gone below wherever the volatility wall was."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3079000","3083000"," And then you know that, you know that from the puts that were taken out,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3083000","3087000"," the short dated puts, where the top is up here, you know where the safety is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3087000","3090000"," This was actually lower as we had it down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3090000","3095000"," This top yellow bands, these yellow bands, lower as we started trading down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3096000","3101000"," And the same thing took place when we started to move up over here and currently heading into,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3101000","3104000"," currently heading into Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3104000","3107000"," This is where bottom is right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3107000","3110000"," So you would have won this entire trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3110000","3112000"," You know, it's the same as up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3112000","3116000"," We talked about this last week on Wednesday where I said two things to you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3116000","3119000"," I said that, or they think this was Wednesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3119000","3121000"," I don't remember what this is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3121000","3124000"," This is Wednesday, I think Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3124000","3125000"," Yeah, this is Wednesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3125000","3133000"," And that was that we knew going into futures and into the open that we were in volatility here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3133000","3137000"," But the prudent thing to do as a bull is you have a couple choices."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3137000","3139000"," You sell for profit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3139000","3140000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3140000","3141000"," And do nothing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3141000","3144000"," Until your next chance to be a bull again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3144000","3147000"," You sell for profit and take short."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3147000","3150000"," That's that's your second choice."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3151000","3157000"," On your third choice would be to let it run, but definitely put some hedging on, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3157000","3160000"," If you weren't going to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3160000","3165000"," Continue long here and you were a bull and you're waiting for your next chance,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3165000","3168000"," you'd still possibly put hedging on here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3168000","3174000"," But what you don't do is stay long here, just hanging out long."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3174000","3176000"," We all know what happens."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3176000","3179000"," You end up losing all your money and blowing your accounts up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3179000","3183000"," So there's there's high risk as a bull up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3183000","3185000"," And down below here, there's high risk."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3185000","3191200"," And as a matter of fact, I remember buying this bottom down here on Thursday and everyone"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3191200","3192800"," thought it was crazy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3192800","3197000"," Everyone thought I was crazy buying this bottom down here on Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3197000","3198600"," People were thought I was crazy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3198600","3202000"," People thought I was crazy buying this people thought I was crazy buying this bottom."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3202000","3203000"," That's really weird."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3203000","3207000"," Like when you're down here, everyone's panicking."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3207000","3210000"," And when you're up here, all the news is great."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3210000","3211000"," There's pumping going on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3211000","3213000"," There's all kinds of nonsense up here too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3213000","3218000"," And you have to learn how to manage your trades."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3218000","3222000"," And I was thinking that you guys should be doing is setting it out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3222000","3227000"," Like get on your cell phone for, let's say on Monday we go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3227000","3229000"," Let's just say we go up on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3229000","3230000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3230000","3235000"," You should be setting like an alert on your cell phone or on these, on your trading app,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3235000","3237000"," when you're broke or you should be able to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3237000","3242000"," If I right click on this, do you see how I can add to watch list or create an alert?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3242000","3247000"," If you were to just create an alert for when you get up here tomorrow or actually it's"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3247000","3248000"," lower for tomorrow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3248000","3249000"," I think it's 675."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3249000","3254000"," I think it's 465 for tomorrow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3254000","3256000"," Start hitting volatility."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3256000","3258000"," I'll redo these lines for you today."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3258000","3260000"," Well, you know what I'll do?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3260000","3264000"," I'll make a video for you tonight showing you where volatility is into tomorrow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3264000","3270000"," But if you were to just set alerts on these lines and then write yourself a message that"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3270000","3272000"," says buy hedges."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3272000","3279000"," If you're a bear down here, let's say you held puts or you bought you what you longed puts"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3279000","3283000"," on Friday or you shorted into Friday for Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3283000","3289000"," How many of you bears out there bought a call hedge for 10 cents on Friday at the close?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3289000","3292000"," I'm going to ask you guys right now why you guys respond on text message."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3292000","3299000"," How many of you bears out there that held shorts over the weekend or bought calls over"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3299000","3304000"," the weekend or sold calls at whatever bearish position you took?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3304000","3310000"," There were 10 cent calls, 10 cent, 470 calls on Friday at the bell."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3310000","3314000"," How many of you bought those as a hedge?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3314000","3316000"," No, the put wall is higher."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3316000","3317000"," I don't know."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3317000","3320000"," I'll explain this better to you in a little bit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3320000","3323000"," The put wall is not lower."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3323000","3326000"," The call wall has raised."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3326000","3330000"," I'll make a video tonight for you guys so you can chart this out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3330000","3334000"," But I want to know how many of you bears out there hedged with calls?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3334000","3341000"," Because I'm going to bet that any of you that did hold puts or short over the weekend did not hedge"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3341000","3343000"," because I know bulls don't do it either."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3343000","3349000"," I know for a fact that bulls don't do it and I know for a fact bears don't do it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3349000","3359000"," Anybody? Did anybody buy penny calls as a hedge that went short over the weekend or bought puts?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3359000","3363000"," I'm going to say most of you didn't."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3363000","3370000"," And your short brand and your short and two Monday?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3370000","3378000"," You're short as well. You're heavy short with some OTM calls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3378000","3380000"," Nothing hedged out of bear."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3380000","3387000"," I didn't see you in calls at 470 on thinkorswim."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3387000","3389000"," I bought them but not as a hedge."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3389000","3390000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3390000","3394000"," Yeah, if you're if you're a bear."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3395000","3397000"," Yeah, if you're a bear and you're if you are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3397000","3400000"," This is the same story I'd tell a bull up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3400000","3403000"," I tell the exact same story. It doesn't matter if you're a bear or if you're bull."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3403000","3406000"," It's the same story in the opposite on both ends."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3406000","3412000"," And usually even if we sell off down here, what is the what is the resolution in our market?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3412000","3415000"," Always remember that the resolution is up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3415000","3416000"," It always is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3416000","3421000"," And we do sell above. We take profit above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3421000","3424000"," But the banks end up having to deploy money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3424000","3427000"," On every side of a trade, I want you all to remember."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3427000","3430000"," There are some basic rules."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3430000","3433000"," Whoever there's a seller, there's a buyer."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3433000","3436000"," And who moves these markets are banks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3436000","3441000"," So we don't move markets. We don't move. We might move like a penny stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3441000","3444000"," That's that has that doesn't have a lot of stock out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3444000","3447000"," But in general, we don't move these markets."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3447000","3449000"," So you have a bank that's selling for profit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3449000","3453000"," And you have another bank that's picking up these these cells."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3453000","3455000"," And they want to get profit as well."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3455000","3458000"," So we will eventually go back up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3461000","3464000"," To go up for those 10 centers to go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3464000","3466000"," That's a good question, Alex."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3466000","3469000"," So a lot of people follow me on Twitter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3469000","3475000"," And know that I'll I'll take those 10 cent trades once a week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3476000","3478000"," Once every week or so."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3478000","3481000"," More frequently than in the past."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3481000","3485000"," So usually I'll take the 10 cent weeklies in the past."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3485000","3487000"," But the past two months."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3487000","3492000"," I've been taking them every three, four days and they print stupid money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3492000","3494000"," But when you're buying them, it's usually."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3494000","3497000"," It's all doom and gloom when you're buying them."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3497000","3501000"," The timing is like you're entering these trades at three,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3501000","3504000"," at three fifty five, three fifty nine."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3505000","3510000"," Sometimes you have to average down into the four fifteen time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3510000","3512000"," Like sometimes you'll see."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3514000","3518000"," The theta vampires come in at like four, four, ten PM."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3518000","3523000"," So you have to buy another rack at nine cents or eight cents or five cents."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3525000","3529000"," If you make them weeklies, they can be very profitable."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3529000","3534000"," If they're weeklies, if you're buying like weeklies that are like 30 cents on down days,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3534000","3537000"," like how do you bought weeklies right here on Friday?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3537000","3538000"," I think I have some."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3538000","3539000"," I'm not positive."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3539000","3541000"," I'll have to look and see where all my trades are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","3541000","3543000"," If you want, I'll post those for you."

"qVwfuBq-D6U","4283000","4285000"," Let's see if they put some volume."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4285000","4290000"," Let me put a volume volume indicator in here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4290000","4291000"," Nope."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4291000","4292000"," Nope."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4292000","4293000"," Hang tight."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4293000","4294000"," Indicators."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4294000","4298000"," Let's see a basic volume indicator."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4298000","4303000"," There's the volume indicator make this nice and simple."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4303000","4305000"," Easy peasy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4305000","4307000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4307000","4310000"," You see this move up into earnings right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4310000","4312000"," See this nice green bar right here."

"qVwfuBq-D6U","4313000","4315000"," Bought this low took it into earnings."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4316000","4318000"," They took their profits and ran."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4318000","4320000"," We sold back down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4320000","4321000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4321000","4323000"," And we're looking for some volume in here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4323000","4327000"," You see this volume accumulation on the top left hand side."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4327000","4331000"," You'll see two point four five million."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4331000","4335000"," So we'll start we're on the what's our timeframe a week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4335000","4340000"," So we'll go to a one year chart."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4341000","4345000"," And you'll see this nice accumulation in here right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4345000","4348000"," Bring this chart back for you."

"qVwfuBq-D6U","4354000","4356000"," You know what I'm going to do."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4356000","4359000"," I'm going to go to one year chart."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4359000","4362000"," And you'll see this nice accumulation in here right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4362000","4364000"," Bring this chart back for you."

"qVwfuBq-D6U","4369000","4372000"," You know that you see right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4372000","4373000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4373000","4375000"," You see that there are some trap sellers in here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4375000","4377000"," There's capitulation down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4377000","4380000"," You probably rebop back in along with the banks moving on up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4380000","4385000"," You see that we had some sellers above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4385000","4387000"," So instead of so rather than catching knives right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4387000","4390000"," We're just talking about where the sellers are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4390000","4395000"," We know that there are sellers above here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4395000","4397000"," We know that there are probably some sellers above somewhere"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4397000","4401000"," up in here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4401000","4406000"," We know there's probably some more sellers above here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4406000","4410000"," So though this is probably not the best buy right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4410000","4414000"," We know that we're looking for is are there still sellers up here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4414000","4415000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4415000","4418000"," We want to know if there are still some sellers over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4418000","4423000"," So what I'll do is which one, which one do I take?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4427000","4429000"," Nope."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4457000","4459000"," You know the banks are on this trend line."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4459000","4461000"," They sold for profit down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4461000","4464000"," You know the banks are right here and they're going to want to take some profit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4464000","4467000"," You're probably going to have some volatility at 4249."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4467000","4472000"," But if we make a leg up above here, you're going to be looking for a move up to $50."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4472000","4475000"," So if there's any weakness in here, moving on, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4475000","4478000"," This is December 27th, 30th."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4478000","4483000"," If you see any weakness in here, you can see that we're at $50, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4483000","4485000"," This is starting to become a losing stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4485000","4490000"," Let's say we sell down here, you're going to set an alert on this on this bar right here"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4490000","4493000"," on your own charting software and trading view."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4493000","4496000"," And every time we touch right here, you're going to buy moving forward."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4496000","4498000"," Does that make sense?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4498000","4499000"," And you guys understand this?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4499000","4501000"," So we've had a move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4501000","4503000"," You see this move, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4503000","4506000"," We have this recovery here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4506000","4512000"," If we sell here, we bounce back down and find support and you get an alert here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4513000","4517000"," You're going to look for buyers to step in to make this breakthrough above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4517000","4520000"," You'll make tight stops below this line right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4520000","4522000"," So you can set another alert."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4522000","4527000"," It's down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4527000","4529000"," And you make this your stop alert."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4529000","4531000"," So you set an alert below here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4531000","4533000"," So let's say you buy this dip right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4533000","4538000"," Let's say we have a little bit of, we have a little bit of resistance above, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4538000","4541000"," You buy this down below to go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4541000","4545000"," You're going to stop on this line right here that sets an alert."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4545000","4550000"," So let's say you buy this and you go to work that day and we start to break through this"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4550000","4553000"," hard support because we know that the banks are moving this here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4553000","4556000"," This right here is a heavy support line."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4556000","4558000"," We know we got a reaction twice."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4558000","4560000"," We know we're going to get a reaction over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4560000","4562000"," Well, most definitely."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4562000","4566000"," And this should create a squeeze condition to push us up to $50."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4566000","4570000"," So let's say we missed this trade and it just keeps going up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4570000","4571000"," You can let this one go."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4571000","4577000"," But if you have this trade in your, make your setting alerts on in your, your brokerage,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4577000","4585000"," you know that on let's say, let's say on the, let's say, let's say it's on January 10th."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4585000","4590000"," You get an email message that says, Hey, we're at $36 Captain Jim."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4590000","4592000"," Do you want to buy this?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4592000","4595000"," I'm going to look for news out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4595000","4600000"," Any negative news on harmony biosciences."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4600000","4603000"," I'm going to look to see if they have any news coming out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4603000","4606000"," They have expected a lot of these biotech stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4606000","4612000"," They might have an expected news release that they're expecting to come out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4612000","4618000"," They might have had a news release here on the 30th, but either way, you're looking for some kind of a support here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4618000","4620000"," This is your tight stop right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4620000","4623000"," You set alert for this in case your trade fails."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4623000","4627000"," Otherwise, you want to buy any weakness here for this next move up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4627000","4629000"," So you can do your due diligence on this company."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4629000","4633000"," You can end up doing, or setting alerts to take this long."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4633000","4637000"," You can see that they're moving this, this long right here, but they've reversed course."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4637000","4643000"," And the last thing I want to talk to you about this is, let me see."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4643000","4646000"," What's the biotech?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4646000","4649000"," Is the biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4649000","4654000"," You see the biotech ETF."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4654000","4657000"," Is that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4657000","4660000"," I think it's."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4660000","4664000"," Is it MSOS? I can't remember."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4664000","4669000"," I can't remember if the big one is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4669000","4671000"," Yeah, XBI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4671000","4673000"," Let's look at XBI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4673000","4674000"," That's a good one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4675000","4683000"," So let's say now, let's say now you've identified this tech stock or this, this biotech stock and you're like, oh yeah, I like this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4683000","4687000"," And I hear everybody's talking right now about biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4687000","4692000"," So let's say I don't want to take the risk on an individual ticker here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4692000","4694000"," I'm going to bring up XBI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4694000","4699000"," This is the spider biotech ETF."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4699000","4702000"," I'm like, I'm doing my due diligence, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4702000","4712000"," And lo and behold, what am I looking at here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4712000","4715000"," Got this nice consolidation phase right here back here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4715000","4718000"," You see this in August of 2020."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4718000","4719000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4719000","4720000"," Saw the trade was taken up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4720000","4721000"," These are banks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4721000","4723000"," This isn't you and I doing this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4723000","4728000"," They move this, they move the CTF up to $174.88."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4728000","4733000"," I know that everybody's talking and chatting about biotech right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4733000","4735000"," Hot, hot, hot, talk, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4735000","4738000"," And all of a sudden, what do I see down here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4738000","4740000"," You see this over here on your left."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4740000","4742000"," You see this accumulation phase."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4742000","4744000"," Bottom left hand side."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4744000","4746000"," And what do I see right here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4746000","4748000"," See this giant accumulation phase."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4748000","4751000"," You see this on the right over here in December."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4751000","4757000"," So I'm going to start to say to myself, oh, look, I've got biotech companies coming up in my stock screener."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4757000","4760000"," I see great profit taking and biotech over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4760000","4764000"," This started in February of 2021."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4764000","4768000"," Now I've been, I've been drilling into all of you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4768000","4773000"," The past few weeks I've said to you, you're looking to identify."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4773000","4779000"," Stocks that have been selling off since at least February of 2021."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4779000","4781000"," If not before, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4781000","4783000"," So this looks like a good candidate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4783000","4785000"," Now, does this mean it's going to work out?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4785000","4790000"," No, I'm not giving you financial advice now as to what you should be investing in in 2022."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4790000","4794000"," But we have to take risk on as investors."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4794000","4802000"," If I'm looking at this spot, this spider, this biotech ETF versus the spy or NDX, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4802000","4803000"," The NASDAQ."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4803000","4808000"," This, this, this looks much nicer to me at this moment than NASDAQ."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4808000","4810000"," Not as risky, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4810000","4812000"," And I want to put on some risk in this market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4812000","4814000"," I don't know where to put on risk."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4814000","4815000"," I'm not a bear."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4815000","4817000"," I don't like being a bear is dangerous."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4817000","4819000"," It's not easy being a bear."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4819000","4824000"," So one thing I'll give you bears out there is it's dangerous."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4824000","4828000"," You see hedge funds blow up the smartest people in this country."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4828000","4832000"," They blow up all the time, all the time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4832000","4837000"," So when I'm looking at this right here, this, this looks pretty reasonable."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4838000","4843000"," I could put a stop down below an XPI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4843000","4846000"," Let's say I, or let's say I put, forget to stop."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4846000","4851000"," Let's say I put, send me an alert because I'll buy this right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4851000","4854000"," Matter of fact, this is one of the ones I'm going to be buying."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4854000","4859000"," But for 2022, but my point is, let's say I have a, let's say I have an alert set here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4859000","4861000"," It's set an alert for here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4862000","4867000"," And then let's say I set a doomer gloom because you know that there are phishing expeditions."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4867000","4874000"," You know that algos will dump us briefly for just a minute, a day, a half a day to shake out people,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4874000","4879000"," to, to accumulate their shares."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4879000","4881000"," And this looks like it's ready to move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4881000","4882000"," I mean, this looks good, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4882000","4884000"," You put an alert here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4884000","4887000"," Maybe this is your stop loss down below at 100, 107."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4887000","4890000"," We're only at 115 right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4890000","4891000"," This is looking pretty tasty."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4891000","4898000"," I mean, you figure you probably have a truck, some trap sellers above at 148."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4898000","4904000"," I mean, you can't, you can't deny that this doesn't look like a great, a great trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4904000","4910000"," You've got some volatility that'll probably enter here, somewhere up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4910000","4916000"," We can turn that into a, into like a zone of volatility."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4916000","4919000"," You might find a little bit more down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4919000","4923000"," You could put another one, some, some trap sellers down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4923000","4926000"," We'll make that one a little bit different."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4926000","4928000"," You can set alerts for all this stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4928000","4933000"," When you set your alerts on these things, you can, you can, you can put specific notes in there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4933000","4939000"," Trap sellers, you can write, I always like, I write trap sellers all the time because I'm looking for them."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4939000","4944000"," And then as this moves up, you know what the support is when I share this stuff with you guys,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4944000","4948000"," as we move up, you can raise your stop losses, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4948000","4955000"," This alert is you can actually raise this up and it will change in your alerts where your stop losses are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4955000","4961000"," I don't know if any of you guys know that, but when you make an alert on one of these supports,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4961000","4967000"," you can actually move them up to alert you for, for when you've broken through your support,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4967000","4970000"," where you want your stop losses to be."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4970000","4974000"," And let's say you're, you're heading up here and you start to bounce off this first, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4974000","4977000"," You'd eventually move this one up right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4977000","4980000"," You'd move this nut, your next stop loss down below here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4980000","4987000"," And you're looking for some, you'll, they'll probably sell up and sell down until they can consolidate once more."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4987000","4990000"," Just like this is nice consolidation phase right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4990000","4993000"," You'll see something like that take place again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4993000","4995000"," We'll move up and up and up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4995000","4997000"," You guys understanding all this?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","4998000","5001000"," I'm going to stop for a minute and talk to you guys about this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5001000","5003000"," I want to hear what your thoughts are at this point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5005000","5011000"," Hey, Cap, are there any tools you use to size positions, especially when hedging MSOS is weed?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5011000","5013000"," Is there, yeah, I got the wrong one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5013000","5014000"," It was an MOS."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5014000","5017000"," Well, we're going to have a list over there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5017000","5020000"," A paper list of stuff that I want to look at today."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5020000","5023000"," So it just happened to be right next to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5024000","5025000"," X, B, I."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5025000","5028000"," Is there any stairs there stop us to get out?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5028000","5031000"," You set an alert to buy on more weakness."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5031000","5034000"," Looks like it go a tad lower chase window."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5034000","5035000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5035000","5036000"," Chase, let me show you a tad lower."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5036000","5037000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5037000","5038000"," Let me show you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5038000","5040000"," I want to show chase this so he can see it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5045000","5049000"," So when you're catching knives, I want you guys to understand what you're looking for when you catch knives."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5049000","5051000"," You'll see moves like this over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5051000","5053000"," You'll see these capitulation moves."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5053000","5057000"," And then you're going to be looking for hard bounces."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5057000","5059000"," One, two, three."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5059000","5065000"," When you start to see this move in here, you're looking for giant red bars and giant green bars."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5065000","5067000"," And that's pretty much what's happening right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5067000","5069000"," This is accumulation right here that's going on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5069000","5071000"," Matter of fact, we'll bring it to a day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5071000","5073000"," So you can see it on a better."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5074000","5075000"," A better timeframe."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5075000","5078000"," Let's scroll this side a little bit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5078000","5085000"," Why you guys to see what you're looking for when you're catching knives."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5085000","5087000"," And you're looking for moves like this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5087000","5089000"," You're looking for this big giant red bar."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5089000","5095000"," You're looking for a couple more slams to try to go lower and utter complete rejection."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5095000","5097000"," This isn't retail."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5097000","5099000"," These are banks that are saying, nope."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5099000","5101000"," We're buying here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5101000","5105000"," Sell me everything capitulate to me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5105000","5107000"," Oh, yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5107000","5109000"," 107 does look better and you can wait."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5109000","5113000"," That is one thing too is you can if you're, let's say you're bearish."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5113000","5117000"," You can set an alert to buy a 107."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5117000","5119000"," And if you make enough of these."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5119000","5123000"," It doesn't matter if this one doesn't work out for you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5123000","5124000"," You want to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5125000","5130000"," A bunch of these you want to chart 100 to 200 to 300."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5130000","5133000"," And the neat part about charting these out for yourself."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5133000","5136000"," Is that you can come back in a year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5136000","5138000"," Or a three months or two months."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5138000","5141000"," We know what I normally do is I'll chart these out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5141000","5146000"," And lo and behold, like two weeks or three months or a month later."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5146000","5148000"," I will start to hear the chatter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5149000","5151000"," Well, everybody was all doom and gloom."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5151000","5168000"," A month later, three months later, six months later, I'll start to hear the chatter again and I'll say, oh, they're talking about this ETF or this stock that I charted out a month ago."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5168000","5171000"," And having charted all this out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5171000","5174000"," I want to see where it is now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5174000","5177000"," And it will make you a better buyer, a better charter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5178000","5181000"," You'll do much better job of charting out of stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5181000","5183000"," Because you'll see where your faults are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5183000","5189000"," You'll start to figure out where you should have actually drawn supports on stocks where to buy and where to sell."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5189000","5192000"," It makes you a better investor over time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5196000","5202000"," By charting these stocks out and you let's say you add three of these a week or five of these a week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5203000","5206000"," Over time, when you start to hear, let's say no one's talking about XBI right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5206000","5208000"," Let's guarantee you and I guarantee you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5208000","5211000"," The next month, you're going to hear everyone raging about XBI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5211000","5213000"," That's all they're going to do."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5213000","5222000"," It'll be something positive and you're not in XBI any longer, but at least you charted this out to see, hey, I should have taken that trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5222000","5223000"," Does that make sense?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5223000","5231000"," Let's say in six months of the year after doing this, three months, whatever you're comfortable with, you'll get a better idea of what you're looking for."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5231000","5234000"," What you're looking for to buy and to sell."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5234000","5236000"," And you can see it right here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5236000","5239000"," Basically, see this is your buy, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5239000","5242000"," You can put one more line below down here as a stop loss."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5242000","5244000"," This is your buy zone."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5244000","5247000"," This is your sell zone, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5247000","5254000"," And then you're going to look for a new support to be put in for consolidation for the next move up to $175."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5257000","5259000"," Yeah, but this looks great."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5259000","5262000"," I think XBI looks great."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5262000","5269000"," I think you would have a hard time finding many ETFs right now that look this good."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5269000","5271000"," And everyone has to put risk on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5271000","5279000"," If you're not putting risk on, even if it's calculated risk, then you can't be in the stock market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5279000","5282000"," There is risk involved."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5282000","5286000"," Most people lose all of their money in the stock market eventually."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5286000","5297000"," But if you're going to take on risk, you will have to at least, I mean, would I be telling you right now to buy $175 on the XBI?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5297000","5300000"," You guys know I wouldn't, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5300000","5303000"," You guys know that I'll never show you a stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5303000","5309000"," I'll never tell you to buy Tesla at 12, or like, I was telling people not to buy Tesla at 1200."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5309000","5312000"," I got yelled at by all the Tesla bulls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5312000","5314000"," I don't buy up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5314000","5316000"," I buy down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5316000","5317000"," Always."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5317000","5318000"," I buy down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5318000","5321000"," Always, always, always, always, always buying down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5321000","5326000"," Or I'm buying on strength, a reversal down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5326000","5331000"," Some of you, some of you bears out there probably say things like, this is a good one too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5331000","5334000"," They'll say a bear will say the corrective phase isn't over."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5334000","5336000"," And that does make sense."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5336000","5338000"," Let me, hold on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5338000","5341000"," Let me show you something else, guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5341000","5345000"," Or you're not, let me do this instead."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5345000","5353000"," So, brush, you'll see a corrective phase that goes like this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5353000","5355000"," Sometimes, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5355000","5358000"," There'll be a move up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5358000","5360000"," And then we come down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5360000","5365000"," And that is probable as well that that can take place."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5365000","5366000"," I'll make videos."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5366000","5368000"," I'm doing a training class."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5368000","5369000"," Talk to you guys about this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5369000","5370000"," Oops."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5370000","5375000"," Sorry, hold on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5375000","5378000"," I'll show you guys some, how corrections happen."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5378000","5380000"," Sometimes you'll see a move down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5380000","5384000"," You'll see one move up that'll trick bulls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5384000","5390000"," And then you'll continue to sell down to, to an actual bottom down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5390000","5392000"," I see a three aware of these moves right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5392000","5394000"," And this is actually what took place here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5394000","5395000"," You can actually see that it took place."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5395000","5397000"," We sold down, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5397000","5398000"," The bulls thought they had it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5398000","5402000"," And in reality, this is usually algorithms doing this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5402000","5403000"," Computers do this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5403000","5404000"," We'll do this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5404000","5409000"," You'll see this often in bonds that you'll see one more pump or two."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5409000","5411000"," It'll trap buyers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5411000","5413000"," And there's another corrective phase down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5413000","5418000"," As a matter of fact, this is more than likely the move for Tesla."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5418000","5421000"," You'll see this will be Tesla at 900."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5421000","5422000"," You'll see a move above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5422000","5423000"," Everyone will buy Tesla."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5423000","5428000"," And then it'll, it'll, it'll shoot down to 750 into the new year at some point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5428000","5430000"," This would be the January move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5430000","5433000"," If you were going to see Tesla make a move up, it would, this would be that January"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5433000","5434000"," March play."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5434000","5440000"," And then once we hit that January March number, let's call it 1100 or something,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5440000","5445000"," we'll sell back down to 750 into March probably."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5445000","5450000"," I can't give you an exact timeframe, but some move like this is what I would expect"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5450000","5452000"," out of Tesla."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5453000","5458000"," And this is a common move in, in stock retracements, in corrective, in stock"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5458000","5461000"," corrections."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5461000","5462000"," But this looks good right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5462000","5464000"," This looks like the correction is over."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5464000","5467000"," You are already going to put stops in."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5467000","5472000"," So let's say at 107 and you start, and we start to break below here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5472000","5474000"," This is where you'd pull the plug."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5474000","5477000"," So if you're putting risk on the market, you know that there's always going to be"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5477000","5478000"," risk."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5478000","5480000"," You know that these players aren't going to work every single time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5480000","5482000"," So let's say you're going to buy in here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5482000","5487000"," You would already know that if we get below 107 or let's call it 105 or 100,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5487000","5491000"," that would be a psychological, a 100 would be a psychological break."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5491000","5495000"," And you can put something down here at 100 and you just call that your stop"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5495000","5496000"," loss."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5496000","5500000"," And you can mark all these, write some words in here, type in stop loss,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5500000","5502000"," do an alert for yourself."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5502000","5505000"," And you don't have to trade all these indexes or stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5505000","5510000"," You're just going to be accumulating these."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5510000","5514000"," And then you do some due diligence in the ones that ready."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5514000","5515000"," This is where you like a stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5515000","5517000"," You say, hey, I like biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5517000","5522000"," I'm going to do harmony and I'm going to do the biotech ETF for safety."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5522000","5523000"," Right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5523000","5527000"," Or I like tech because we've got tech ones we can do as well."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5527000","5533000"," And you're going to track these and you're also going to find the one that you"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5533000","5537000"," want to trade that is reversing course or showing signs of reversing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5537000","5539000"," You see all this volume down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5539000","5543000"," This is important that you have all these indicators happening."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5543000","5546000"," That this could be a, this, this looks like a reversal."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5546000","5548000"," How far is that reversal?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5548000","5550000"," Well, right now we're looking for what?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5550000","5552000"," 134, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5552000","5554000"," For volatility to kick in again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5554000","5558000"," And ultimately we're looking for 150 at a minimum or slightly below it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5558000","5561000"," Probably 148, if I had to guess."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5561000","5563000"," Or 146."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5563000","5567000"," Somewhere in there 146 would be my target price."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5567000","5569000"," That's what I'm targeting."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5569000","5573000"," Oh yeah, PubM's a good one too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5573000","5575000"," PubM's a great one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5575000","5576000"," We'll look at PubM right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5576000","5579000"," Actually, let me show you one more in the stock screen here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5579000","5581000"," So you've got Alec."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5581000","5584000"," You guys now have what I do here for harmony."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5584000","5586000"," You guys can do the same thing for Alec."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5586000","5588000"," Look at, look at the consolidation."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5588000","5589000"," Alec real quick."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5590000","5591000"," Let's look at Alec."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5591000","5593000"," But PubM, yes, I want to revisit that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5593000","5600000"," Or I will, if I don't get to PubM, I will at least chart it for you to have access to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5600000","5608000"," So let's look at Alec real quick."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5608000","5613000"," Because I have, I think I have PubM charted on my Webull on a wrong one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5613000","5614000"," Hold on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5614000","5618000"," I think I have Alec charted on my Webull or PubM charted on my Webull."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5618000","5621000"," But not on trading view."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5621000","5625000"," So I'll chart it out on the."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5625000","5629000"," And we will."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5629000","5638000"," So this is a beautiful chart, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5638000","5642000"," We have an Alec."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5642000","5651000"," We have great consolidation down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5651000","5661000"," We're going to change these to solid lines."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5661000","5663000"," Always like to see this stuff, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5663000","5667000"," Buying the weakness or selling the strength, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5667000","5668000"," One more bounce here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5668000","5671000"," We know that this is now support at this point was support."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5671000","5672000"," We saw that bounce."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5672000","5673000"," We did it again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5673000","5674000"," We sold."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5674000","5677000"," And of course, we've got that nice little line right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5677000","5681000"," We already know that there are trap sellers above took profit again, sold it down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5681000","5687000"," We had capitulation went nice and deep down here to seven bucks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5687000","5689000"," We know we had buyers down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5689000","5690000"," They brought us up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5690000","5692000"," We had moments of consolidation."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5692000","5695000"," They sold it up, took more profit, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5695000","5697000"," Sold it down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5697000","5700000"," Probably looking for some consolidation again down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5700000","5707000"," Even though it's turning up right now, we probably have lots of trap buyers in here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5707000","5709000"," Even if we missed this trade, that's okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5709000","5714000"," We're going to chart them out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5714000","5716000"," You're looking for a failure."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5716000","5718000"," So you need set alert here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5718000","5723000"," We'll be setting all alert here and hopefully you can get some capitulation."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5723000","5725000"," We know that this has worked in the past."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5725000","5727000"," We know we've worked here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5728000","5731000"," We had consolidation profit sold down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5731000","5737000"," We know we had more consolidation profit sold down, trying to work its way back up once more."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5737000","5743000"," We know we've got some kind of a, some kind of a save over here, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5743000","5745000"," So put another one over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5745000","5752000"," A little supposedly supposed and support line, but you're looking for a reaction here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5752000","5756000"," You're looking for us to not break this another bounce."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5756000","5758000"," I always like to see you over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5758000","5761000"," People talk about double bottoms, triple bottoms, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5761000","5763000"," I gave you one chance to dump it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5763000","5765000"," I gave you two chances to dump it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5765000","5767000"," I gave you three chances to dump it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5767000","5773000"," When you dump, when you try to dump it one, two, three times and it fails, what happens?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5773000","5775000"," We go up, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5775000","5778000"," So you get one, two, three."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5778000","5781000"," Starts to create this nice little wedge down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5781000","5783000"," Let's say we bounce."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5783000","5791000"," My expectation would be that we're going to bounce here, two, two."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5791000","5795000"," A brief capitulation down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5795000","5797000"," And really that's the moment that you're looking for."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5797000","5800000"," You're going to buy and you're going to see this rocket up again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5800000","5802000"," Does that make sense?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5802000","5806000"," That's what I'd be looking for on this stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5806000","5811000"," You might even have this might, this might even come up a little bit and then fail."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5811000","5817000"," Bounce to third capitulation, then you'll get your true push up even higher."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5817000","5820000"," But that's why you're studying these alerts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5820000","5821000"," You want to see the failures."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5821000","5824000"," You want to be alerted so that you don't have to pay attention to the stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5824000","5829000"," You want to be able to just come back to it, see what's going on here, see if it fails."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5829000","5831000"," You want to see if it continues to consolidate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5831000","5839000"," And let's say ALEC pops off for you at $15 in a month or three months."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5839000","5840000"," That's a buy for me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5841000","5842000"," 100%."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5842000","5848000"," If ALEC ever comes back to $15.22, I'm buying it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5848000","5849000"," Does that make sense?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5849000","5854000"," Are you guys all following along with this stuff?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5854000","5855000"," We'll do one more right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5855000","5857000"," I don't like this one, BFRI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5857000","5862000"," But I do like this one, HCDI."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5862000","5869000"," I don't always like these."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5870000","5874000"," Harbor Custom Development."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5874000","5879000"," Remember to do your due diligence on these companies."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5879000","5884000"," Five bucks, now it's down to $2.88."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5884000","5885000"," This one I consider risky."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5885000","5888000"," I don't like trading penny stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5888000","5898000"," I consider anything that's, I consider any stock below a certain market cap, $3 billion in market cap."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5898000","5901000"," I don't really like trading these smaller stocks this small."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5901000","5908000"," Anything that's really this tiny, $2.88, I might set an alert for this one back down at $2.88"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5908000","5909000"," again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5909000","5911000"," I like this volume here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5911000","5913000"," This is nice volume."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5913000","5916000"," What day was this?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5916000","5917000"," November."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5917000","5921000"," I like this accumulation down below here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5921000","5922000"," This is in November."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5922000","5926000"," They bought at $6.73."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5926000","5928000"," I guess I'd set another alert down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5928000","5935000"," I will trade these sometimes, but it's rare because I don't like to watch them."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5935000","5940000"," You know that they took, you see that they took profit up here too at $3.02, bought down below"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5940000","5944000"," here somewhere."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5944000","5946000"," $2, they sold at $3."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5946000","5950000"," I don't really like this one, but let's just say we sell down to this one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5950000","5951000"," It's $3.33."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5951000","5958000"," I'd probably set an alert at $2.18, and then I would, yeah, I'd set an alert at $2.13,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5958000","5963000"," and then I'd be setting an alert for just to pay attention and then set an alert at $1.73,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5963000","5967000"," and I'd be looking for sellers above somewhere up here again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5967000","5969000"," This looks like it could rip actually."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5969000","5979000"," This is risky, risky trade, but it does look like it's accumulating for some form of a large bar up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5979000","5994000"," Maybe it could tag, see, this could possibly tag $3.371, maybe, maybe."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5994000","5997000"," I don't know if I like that either."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","5998000","6000000"," I don't like trade and pennies anymore."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6000000","6012000"," I did this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6012000","6014000"," They're always so risky."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6014000","6019000"," So many scams with these stocks, but you can see where it's shaping up to be, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6019000","6022000"," This is why people like this stock right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6022000","6026000"," Consolidation, boom, some small rejection."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6027000","6029000"," Maybe we swoop down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6029000","6031000"," I shouldn't be doing this stock for you guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6031000","6033000"," These are not the stocks you want to be trading."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6033000","6039000"," Maybe you're looking for something like this, some kind of a high spike to $5."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6039000","6046000"," If I had to guess, something like that's going to happen."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6046000","6049000"," If not allowed, let me know, and I'll DM you later."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6049000","6055000"," Hate calling for tickers, but I own GEO and fail to sell what it squeezed to $11."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6055000","6058000"," Now, I've been holding almost a year, so still up, but not insanely up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6058000","6060000"," Okay, so what I'll do is this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6060000","6070000"," Alex sent me a DM so that on my Captain's Alpha handle, so that I don't forget."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6070000","6073000"," Well, off-bottom's high volume, especially takes that a previous pillow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6073000","6075000"," Take everyone out, observe shares."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6075000","6077000"," Yeah, a little big bear knows what he's talking about."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6077000","6078000"," 100%."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6078000","6080000"," Observe those sellers, man."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6080000","6082000"," Straight capitulation."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6083000","6090000"," Take their shares, force them to get back in, or you dump it just even if they don't sell."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6090000","6094000"," So you've got two, what happens in that situation, you've got two things that happen."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6094000","6103000"," You're absorbing shares from the market and you're creating bag holders that come back in with more money to push it back up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6103000","6110000"," It's like both of those, both of those things are creating this kinetic energy to drive that stock back up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6111000","6116000"," When I was a new trader, I would trade this all day long, but I don't do this anymore."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6116000","6125000"," I used to, I used to like, I'd hunt down these companies and find out if I was going to take a large position, like a $30,000, $25,000 position in a company like this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6125000","6134000"," I'd probably catch like a spirit airline's flight, find out if they're legit, talk to like the desk girl, buy her lunch, walk in the front door, I kid you not."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6134000","6136000"," Yup, take it easy, MA."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6136000","6139000"," Okay, so this, so you guys have a firm understanding of not catching knives."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6139000","6142000"," These stocks will change every single week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6142000","6148000"," Now we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about catching knives."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6148000","6151000"," Okay, we're going to move on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6151000","6153000"," So this is my knife catcher."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6153000","6157000"," So you're going to start with, you're going to start with, you're only doing stocks, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6157000","6162000"," You don't want to be doing, you can go by sector."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6162000","6165000"," If you want to talk about sectors, you can look at biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6165000","6170000"," And then where's the, what am I looking for here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6170000","6173000"," Hold on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6173000","6182000"," That stocks only X fund."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6182000","6185000"," Am I in the right one over here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6185000","6186000"," No sector."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6186000","6187000"," Wrong one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6187000","6191000"," Hang tight here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6191000","6193000"," I'm in the wrong one here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6193000","6194000"," Wait a minute."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6194000","6196000"," Oh, I'm in the wrong one here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6196000","6201000"," Hang tight."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6201000","6206000"," Yeah, index stocks only."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6206000","6219000"," Industry stocks only."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6219000","6224000"," Here's my stocks only button over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6224000","6227000"," Why is that not coming up?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6227000","6229000"," Or is that the top?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6229000","6231000"," Yeah, right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6231000","6235000"," Stocks only excluding ETFs."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6235000","6238000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6238000","6244000"," So you want price below SMA 200 or 200 a moving average, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6244000","6248000"," I'm also looking for relative volume."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6248000","6253000"," And I will begin, I usually try to begin at least at three."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6253000","6257000"," And then I'll change this to five and 10."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6257000","6258000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6258000","6261000"," So we'll start at three and you'll see that the number of stocks become lower."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6261000","6266000"," So I'm a relative volume of, let's say we'll start at three."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6266000","6270000"," And then I'm looking for, what's the, where's the up one at?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6270000","6273000"," The up is change from open."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6274000","6275000"," Change from open."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6275000","6278000"," I'll do up, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6278000","6283000"," And I start to make these stocks go down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6283000","6285000"," And I don't trade small caps often."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6285000","6289000"," I don't trade penny stocks or $10, $25 stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6289000","6293000"," You can do like a market cap on this to make it, if you want to do like a,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6293000","6296000"," what their market cap is to weed out a bunch of these."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6296000","6297000"," Typically I'll just change."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6297000","6298000"," Nope."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6298000","6299000"," Nope."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6299000","6302000"," Hold on here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6303000","6306000"," I'm actually looking for price."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6306000","6312000"," This is really what I'm looking for here is price."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6312000","6313000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6313000","6315000"," And this is basic."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6315000","6317000"," I mean, this really doesn't mean a lot here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6317000","6318000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6318000","6322000"," Now we could do some other, there's some other options in here that I can put in"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6322000","6326000"," that will actually improve this list."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6326000","6329000"," But for when you're getting started, I want you to think about a couple things."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6329000","6333000"," You want, if you're a knife catcher, you're looking to be below 200, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6333000","6337000"," Why are you looking for volume over three times volume?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6337000","6339000"," Because you're looking for those red bars."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6339000","6344000"," You're looking for capitulation, capitulation moments in these stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6344000","6349000"," If I switch to, let's say, so right now I've got a total of 392."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6349000","6354000"," I'm at a high price here so that I can start to look for names that I recognize"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6354000","6357000"," that I hear in the news right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6357000","6359000"," Negative or positive."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6359000","6364000"," Then I'm also looking, let's say I got a volume over, a relative volume over five."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6364000","6367000"," See how I'm now down to 125 tickers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6367000","6372000"," Over 10."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6372000","6376000"," Now I'm down to 30 tickers, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6376000","6380000"," So I can start to look for any names that I know."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6380000","6384000"," And you can see right here, what's the first thing that we notice over here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6384000","6387000"," We're just by industry, biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6387000","6389000"," And we just charted the biotech, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6389000","6393000"," We just had a conversation about biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6393000","6398000"," And I just said to you, oh look, it looks like biotech ETF in this biotech stock"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6398000","6401000"," is starting to get positive."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6401000","6405000"," Now what am I seeing as my top stocks in here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6405000","6411000"," I can start to identify some biotech stocks that are starting to flip, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6411000","6417000"," All of these here, all of these biotechs that are starting to flip, these industries."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6417000","6421000"," Shocker, look what I see down here, more biotech."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6421000","6422000"," You know what I'm saying?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6422000","6429000"," So it's kind of weird that biotech is turning right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6429000","6435000"," So we'll bring it back to three for right now so I can show you the next step in this process."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6435000","6439000"," So we'll go to three."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6439000","6442000"," We know that they were up on Friday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6442000","6444000"," Now what does that mean for us?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6444000","6447000"," We know that the indexes were consolidating down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6447000","6450000"," We know that some stocks though were up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6450000","6456000"," That implies that shorts are being closed in some of these companies as we head into the year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6456000","6461000"," That implies that if we run this, if we run this scan as we head into the 31st,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6461000","6463000"," we're looking for shorts to be closing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6463000","6466000"," And we're going to be looking at names that you know."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6466000","6468000"," You want to be trading names that you're aware of."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6468000","6470000"," Like everybody knows WD-40."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6470000","6473000"," Everybody knows Airbnb, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6473000","6476000"," So we'll chart Airbnb, Airbnb next."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6476000","6479000"," So let's look at Airbnb."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6479000","6483000"," Sometimes AR, is it Airbnb?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6483000","6485000"," I always forget how to chart here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6485000","6489000"," I always forget Airbnb is ticker."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6489000","6490000"," A, B, and B."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6490000","6495000"," Yeah, I always want to put an R in there for some reason."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6495000","6496000"," I like Airbnb."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6496000","6499000"," I've traded this stock many times on Twitter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6499000","6503000"," I know a lot of you guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6503000","6506000"," And you'll see this nice green bar over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6506000","6507000"," You can see it down below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6507000","6509000"," It's kind of hard to see."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6509000","6511000"," But we know we have consolidation on Airbnb."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6511000","6518000"," I've charted this one many times on Webull."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6518000","6522000"," Now some of you guys have followed me on Airbnb and have made bank."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6522000","6524000"," We traded this move right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6524000","6526000"," This one printed giant."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6526000","6530000"," This whole move we traded this move was banging."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6530000","6532000"," So we know this is bottom."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6532000","6534000"," We know we got one, two, three."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6534000","6536000"," We know we have bottom down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6536000","6539000"," We know we have some consolidation zones."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6539000","6545000"," We know this is a consolidation zone."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6545000","6547000"," We know this is a consolidation zone."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6547000","6551000"," We know that really we want it down at 130."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6552000","6556000"," We know that, you know, being greedy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6556000","6560000"," 130 if we had one day of capitulation in springtime down to 130."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6560000","6561000"," This is a buy, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6561000","6562000"," We can say for sure."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6562000","6565000"," This is a buy at 130."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6565000","6569000"," We know that buyers stepped in over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6569000","6572000"," This week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6572000","6575000"," We know we had some major cell downs over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6575000","6576000"," You can see right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6576000","6577000"," We had buyers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6577000","6578000"," We had some updates."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6578000","6580000"," You can see that right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6580000","6581000"," We had buyers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6581000","6582000"," See, last time what happened?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6582000","6583000"," We had buyers back here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6583000","6584000"," What happened?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6584000","6586000"," See what happened back here when we had buyers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6586000","6589000"," And all of a sudden we had buyers here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6589000","6591000"," We had buyers right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6591000","6593000"," So what does this look like to me?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6593000","6597000"," Looks to me like in the short term, we have a buying opportunity."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6597000","6603000"," You know, it looks to me like I could probably throw some outside the money calls on this dated for January or March."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6603000","6606000"," These probably print risky."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6606000","6610000"," I could cut them loose if we start to trade down at a certain level."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6610000","6611000"," Hold on here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6611000","6614000"," Hey, I got to reset this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6614000","6616000"," This happens to me sometimes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6616000","6628000"," Let me leave this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6628000","6632000"," A, B and B."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6632000","6639000"," I'm just a chart."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6639000","6641000"," Put the auto on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6641000","6645000"," Sorry when I expand my page for some reason it'll blow up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6645000","6646000"," It gets all goofy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6646000","6653000"," So I know that there's, I know right now that there is some interest in playing Airbnb."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6653000","6657000"," You can tell from the buys that took place over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6657000","6659000"," I'm going to bring this down to a monthly."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6659000","6663000"," So that nice, see this nice giant green bar over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6663000","6671000"," If I had to guess these are shorts that need to exit before end of year over my guess."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6671000","6676000"," There was rejection here at 155.03."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6676000","6679000"," You can see this gorgeous consolidation over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6679000","6682000"," See this?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6682000","6684000"," This is nice."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6684000","6688000"," When I hold this long term into next year, probably not."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6688000","6693000"," I would set an alert to buy this next year at 130 or above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6693000","6698000"," I would probably buy Airbnb as an investor."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6698000","6704000"," At 140 and start averaging down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6704000","6707000"," This is just my investor cap on right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6707000","6711000"," Somewhere right here is where I'd want to buy it as an investor."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6712000","6714000"," And average down to this 130."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6714000","6720000"," I know for sure that if you have a zero risk type of investor, 130 is sexy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6720000","6725000"," If you do 300 of these stocks and just two or three of these hit in a year,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6725000","6728000"," you're going to be a happy trader, happy investor."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6728000","6730000"," This is like buying the bottoms on the spy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6730000","6735000"," If you'd only taken nine trades, 12 trades this year on the spy, you'd be rich."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6735000","6740000"," So if you're a conservative investor, you'd set this and forget it until it comes back down"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6740000","6744000"," to this 140 to 130 area, at least to peak your interest."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6744000","6756000"," For me as a risk on type trader, my view into January, all this volume is buying that I saw"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6756000","6758000"," down here, this short covering."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6758000","6763000"," My expectation would be that Airbnb is probably going to squeeze at some point coming up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6764000","6768000"," I would probably throw some dirt cheap."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6768000","6774000"," Outside the money calls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6774000","6783000"," On."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6783000","6790000"," Probably, I mean, there's two ways to look at this right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6790000","6793000"," Let's take this trade to resistance above."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6793000","6796000"," That's 155 to 168."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6796000","6797000"," We're in December here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6797000","6801000"," Watch my cursor."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6801000","6804000"," And this is looking ripe right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6804000","6811000"," Absolutely looking ripe right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6811000","6816000"," This is looking ripe for just a move to 168 in the coming week, Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6816000","6818000"," I bet this could happen on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6818000","6819000"," It's possible."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6819000","6823000"," You'd ask yourself, how high can it go?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6823000","6827000"," You don't hit risk until you hit 172, 168 somewhere in here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6827000","6829000"," Could it go higher?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6829000","6830000"," Sure."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6830000","6832000"," But where would you put your risk on?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6832000","6838000"," Like you'd put risk on here or slightly below, let's call risk at 149."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6838000","6843000"," You'd take it right here to just below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6843000","6846000"," I'd let this react and come back down over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6846000","6851000"," If I was going to put more risk on it, wait for it to break above, especially if it was"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6851000","6854000"," a wild squeeze type play."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6854000","6859000"," Let's say it breaks above, bounces once or twice."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6859000","6863000"," And then rockets up to sellers right here, 180s."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6863000","6865000"," I should change the color of this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6865000","6870000"," I'm doing the bear colors."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6870000","6880000"," Nope, hold on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6880000","6881000"," Where do you take the risk here?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6881000","6883000"," Take the risk just here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6883000","6888000"," You're buying this to squeeze into end of year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6888000","6890000"," Couldn't be Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6890000","6896000"," Or you're looking for some form of consolidation in here to squeeze up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6896000","6898000"," This has good potential."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6898000","6901000"," This is something that I'll be looking at on Monday morning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6901000","6909000"," This is something that I wouldn't be surprised to see squeeze either into Monday or possibly"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6909000","6910000"," dip below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6910000","6913000"," Hold on, put that in the trash."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6913000","6918000"," This is something that I'd be looking for."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6918000","6927000"," There's something where you could possibly swing down, consolidate up, bang, come down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6928000","6931000"," It rockets into, we get it first of the year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6931000","6935000"," Either way, either way, you could put spreads on here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6935000","6939000"," Put time on them into January in the money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6939000","6944000"," You could put the spreads deep in the money down here at 140."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6944000","6949000"," You can get real conservative with this stuff so that the future here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6949000","6952000"," Everybody looks great."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6952000","6954000"," So you see how I'm looking for these things?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6955000","6958000"," How many with me right now, 59 of you?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6958000","6960000"," This is how you catch knives, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6960000","6962000"," You guys are always looking at how to catch knives."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6962000","6966000"," AV&B will probably be pushed down by Omicron News in short term."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6966000","6969000"," Yeah, that's a good point, blood stunt."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6969000","6971000"," That's a very good point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6971000","6977000"," Do you think that possibly that Omicron News is intended to push stocks like this down for"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6977000","6980000"," the next squeeze on Tuesday?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6980000","6981000"," Possibly."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6985000","6988000"," Yeah, you do some call spreads."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6988000","6991000"," I think blood stunt's got a fair point on that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6991000","6992000"," Absolutely."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6992000","6996000"," You find out, you find down here and you set these alerts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6996000","6999000"," 140, you could set it at 145, 150."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","6999000","7003000"," You could pay attention to this stock as we move through this week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7003000","7005000"," Let's look at this real quick."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7005000","7007000"," So he's got a fair point, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7007000","7009000"," So let's say you get."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7010000","7025000"," Hey, man, hold on here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7025000","7029000"," This would be this would make sense for Bloodsport, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7029000","7032000"," You get some kind of a stupid squeeze up on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7032000","7035000"," Biden comes out and says something insane."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7035000","7036000"," It could be anybody Trump."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7036000","7037000"," It doesn't matter."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7038000","7039000"," It doesn't matter who it is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7039000","7042000"," Something stupid and insane sells back down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7042000","7046000"," Doom and gloom into the first of the year or into, you know, the 20th, let's say they"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7046000","7047000"," call it the 30th, 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7047000","7052000"," And then in January, February, you get that rocket ship up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7052000","7055000"," And, you know, you're setting up setting alerts here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7055000","7059000"," And what's interesting too is when you set these alerts, it wouldn't shock me to see Biden's"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7059000","7062000"," press conference like 11 o'clock on Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7062000","7063000"," We're right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7063000","7064000"," And it's all."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7064000","7066000"," That's always how it works out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7067000","7071000"," It's always funny to see like, you're like, how is it that we went from here to here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7071000","7073000"," On stock X or whatever."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7073000","7078000"," It would just happen to be right here just before some negative news is coming up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7078000","7080000"," Then all of a sudden you're down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7080000","7082000"," It's December 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7082000","7085000"," And the stock is right on a level of support."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7085000","7088000"," You know, it's always, it's always how it happens."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7088000","7093000"," Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with positive catalyst either or I'm a crime."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7094000","7097000"," I don't trade the news, but I don't trade it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7097000","7098000"," Like I tried it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7098000","7103000"," I trade it where what are they trying to signal and where are we are on the chart."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7103000","7107000"," So if we're right here, I'm typically expecting bad Omicron news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7107000","7112000"," If we're down here and we're right here, I'm going to expect Omicron news to be good."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7112000","7115000"," Does that make better sense than how to interpret the news?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7115000","7116000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7116000","7120000"," You'll expect bad news here for Omicron and good news down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7120000","7124000"," It doesn't matter if down here is here, here, over here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7124000","7128000"," I'm going to expect good news and I'm going to expect bad news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7128000","7130000"," That's, that's usually how it works out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7130000","7133000"," Like we call it 70, 80% of the time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7133000","7140000"," And this is why, so just so you know, when that the old adage of people are of the market,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7140000","7147000"," not liking unknown news is because most news is planned for them to make money and not you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7148000","7152000"," So let's say, let's say we're, we're here and we're supposed to sell off down here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7152000","7157000"," Let's say we're right here and a president's going to come out and give us some bad news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7157000","7162000"," And all of a sudden Airbnb comes out like an hour before and says, Oh, by the way,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7162000","7166000"," we just got bought out by Microsoft."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7166000","7171000"," The, the banks are going to be pissed because immediately we're going to squeeze"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7171000","7172000"," stupid high."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7172000","7176000"," They're going to lose their shorts that they're placing at that moment."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7176000","7180000"," They're going to rage and get pissed off and they're going to pound it down as best they can"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7180000","7182000"," to get their short money back."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7182000","7184000"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7184000","7187000"," I hope it does because that is what happens."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7187000","7189000"," They do not like unknown news."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7189000","7195000"," Banks hate unknown news, especially when they have a plan for what they're doing with a stock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7198000","7200000"," Anything to take more retail money?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7200000","7201000"," Can you do veil?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7201000","7202000"," Go ahead on China."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7202000","7203000"," Yeah, so do me a favor."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7203000","7205000"," I want if you guys, you guys are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7205000","7213000"," I want you guys can each text or I want you to DM me on my captain's alpha handle one ticker."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7213000","7216000"," And if I can get to them, don't go crazy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7216000","7219000"," I don't want 100 tickers inside my DMS."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7219000","7225000"," DM me one ticker that you want charted out and I will chart them out and put them on here for you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7225000","7227000"," I can't get them all done today."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7227000","7228000"," I have to have it's one o'clock."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7228000","7230000"," I've been here since 11 with you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7231000","7234000"," So here's what, here's what to expect at this point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7234000","7235000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7235000","7243000"," I'm going to make a video with your volatility zones on the three major indexes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7243000","7249000"," I will include Tesla, Apple and whatever stocks are holding it or pimp in this market out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7249000","7250000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7250000","7252000"," In that video, I know there's a few."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7252000","7253000"," I forget it's off top."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7253000","7255000"," I had which ones are actually propping up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7256000","7259000"," I think Microsoft and Google."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7259000","7261000"," Tesla and Apple."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7261000","7266000"," I'll have a video up for you for Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7266000","7269000"," That'll be shortened to the point."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7269000","7274000"," I want you to apply these levels to your charts for Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7274000","7277000"," Doesn't matter if you're a bull or a bear."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7277000","7283000"," And I want you to set some alerts for buying hedging in both directions."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7284000","7291000"," I want you guys to start trading within these, these support and resistances."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7291000","7294000"," So that your stop, you stop losing money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7294000","7300000"," You can, you can go full bear, but I want you to take that short to support."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7300000","7305000"," Then I want you to either put some hedging on for an upside move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7305000","7311000"," If you're going to stay short or exit the move and reenter it once we break below that support."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7311000","7313000"," That same thing goes for bulls out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7313000","7314000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7314000","7315000"," Guys, I'll get this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7315000","7317000"," Oh, is my DMS not open?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7317000","7322000"," If my DMs are not open, I will open them to you guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7322000","7325000"," Johnny, I will."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7325000","7326000"," Yes, I am."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7326000","7327000"," You know what I'll do?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7327000","7329000"," I'll check invite the moment I sign off here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7329000","7332000"," I will check invites and get you guys in there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7332000","7335000"," And I will check to see if my DMs are open."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7335000","7336000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7336000","7337000"," If my DMs are not open, I will open them."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7337000","7343000"," My regular handle on, on Twitter, my Captain Jim James handle, they are closed unless"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7343000","7351000"," you're a friend of mine on the, that's because I get a lot of crazy to my notifications."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7351000","7360000"," So people put my, my regular handle into, they'll tag me in these loop messages so that I get"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7360000","7363000"," like 1,000 notifications in a day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7363000","7369000"," People will DM me crazy stuff like my, it's insane on my regular handle."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7369000","7373000"," So on my Captain's Alpha handle, I will open my DMs because there's only a thousand of"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7373000","7374000"," you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7374000","7379000"," Unless, unless I find you guys are fucking with me or something, I'm sorry to swear, but"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7379000","7383000"," let's say find one of you guys out there messing with me, then I'll, I'll block you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7383000","7388000"," That's mostly what the band, just so you guys know too, I don't talk about this on my regular"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7388000","7394000"," Twitter handle, but often on my regular Twitter handle, I'm not able to respond to a lot of"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7394000","7400000"," you because of the spam tough stuff that I get on my handle."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7400000","7401000"," It's wild."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7401000","7407000"," Like I get, I get spammed all day long and all kinds of forms so that I've missed your notifications"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7407000","7410000"," that you've commented."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7410000","7412000"," It's just, it's a mess."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7412000","7416000"," The Twitter is a mess in some respects."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7416000","7419000"," So sometimes I'll block people, I'll ban people."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7419000","7424000"," I used to not block people, but I have to sometimes because of that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7424000","7426000"," I just can't keep up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7426000","7429000"," So it's better for me to talk to you guys over YouTube."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7429000","7433000"," But I wouldn't mind doing like a live Zoom call one day, like maybe a hundred of you or"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7433000","7435000"," fifty of you or whatever."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7435000","7443000"," We could do a live Zoom call and just talk so I can meet you guys in person or whatever."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7443000","7445000"," You know, 1231 calls on spy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7445000","7446000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7446000","7449000"," That's a great question too."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7449000","7453000"," So what I always say is take profit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7453000","7459000"," I think I'm going to talk about that in the video today on the spy as well is that, you know,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7459000","7461000"," don't be, don't be, don't be diamond-handed."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7461000","7466000"," If you guys are placing calls, let's say you're placing weeklies for the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7466000","7470000"," Let's say you bought some weeklies at the close on Friday and they come in the money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7470000","7472000"," You know where resistance is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7472000","7474000"," You know where to take profit."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7474000","7478000"," If you want to go deeper, let's say you think I'm crazy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7478000","7482000"," Let's say you're like, hey Captain Jim, there's no way we're going to sell off on the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7482000","7484000"," You don't know what you're talking about."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7484000","7485000"," I'm going long."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7485000","7487000"," Then at least put some protection on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7487000","7494000"," Buy those cheap puts at the top of that channel or that resistance point or that volatility trigger so that you have some protection."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7494000","7496000"," Does that make sense?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7497000","7499000"," I want you guys to understand this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7499000","7503000"," Let's say you buy a 1231 call and it's making money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7503000","7507000"," Let's say it's up 10% and we hit a volatility trigger."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7507000","7510000"," You either have to call that profit at 10%."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7510000","7512000"," Take your losses at that time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7512000","7516000"," If you bought it, let's say you timed your call wrong and you still aren't making."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7516000","7522000"," Let's say you're down now, let's say you were down 40%, now you're only down 10% and you're hitting a volatility zone."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7523000","7536000"," You're obliged to either cut your losses there or add protection on there to absorb even further losses if we sell down to the 31st and be aware of the potential of us selling down on the 31st."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7536000","7543000"," You have to calculate what the risk you're going to take on, where to cut your losses, where to roll out for better positioning."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7543000","7549000"," I can't make those decisions for you, but that is a good question for myself."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7550000","7552000"," I'm looking for an update on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7552000","7562000"," If I don't find an update on Monday, I'm going to either be adding to my position all the way down to 4550, I think it is."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7562000","7564000"," I'll have the exact numbers for you today."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7564000","7570000"," I think that's where the actual, the deepest, deepest, deepest we can go right now is, I don't think we go that deep."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7570000","7572000"," That's not even our call wall."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7572000","7576000"," 4600 is our call wall. Just see our put wall. Just see now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7576000","7578000"," 4600 is our put wall."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7578000","7588000"," For you to break through that 4600, that a 4500 is going to take a concerted effort by a lot of banks the next few days into Monday, Tuesday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7588000","7596000"," Their best chance of doing it is during a liquid market, so they could attempt to do it in the overnight into the open tomorrow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7597000","7603000"," But even if they did it into the overnight to the open tomorrow, the expectation would be that we are going to slingshot up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7603000","7613000"," If we went to 4550 at the open tomorrow, you'll probably, there's a 70 to 80% chance you would see 140 to 160 point day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7613000","7615000"," Right off the bell."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7615000","7619000"," You'd see a squeeze like you haven't seen."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7619000","7621000"," We've seen these already."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7622000","7624000"," We've already seen these days where you see those squeezes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7624000","7633000"," When we sell down like that, and in liquid movements down to those walls, especially when that deep, you would see a reaction."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7633000","7639000"," You would see an automatic algo buy that'll blow people's asses out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7639000","7642000"," That's why I don't see 4500 on Monday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7642000","7643000"," It's possible."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7643000","7644000"," Anything's possible."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7644000","7648000"," But if we do see it, I'm an all in buyer."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7649000","7652000"," I would put my whole account on after these that day."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7652000","7653000"," My entire account."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7653000","7655000"," I would risk the entire thing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7655000","7658000"," Hands down without a doubt."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7658000","7661000"," The poem means likely to break below."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7661000","7662000"," Yep."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7662000","7664000"," Yeah. Thanks for being here, guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7664000","7667000"," Blood stunt, Brandon Chase, Adam."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7667000","7669000"," Over still analyst research."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7669000","7671000"," Little big bear."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7671000","7672000"," Tegan."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7672000","7674000"," I don't want you any bears out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7674000","7676000"," I don't want you to think that I hate you at all."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7676000","7682000"," I know that there's a, I know I ship post often on Twitter making fun of bears."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7682000","7685000"," I was a bear for a long time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7685000","7687000"," So don't think I hate you guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7687000","7689000"," I want you guys to win and always make money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7689000","7691000"," The market does go up and down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7691000","7693000"," I take short all the time."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7693000","7695000"," So don't think I don't trade short."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7695000","7705000"," I just don't like, or I feel my problem with my problem with, I have the same problem with market crash bears that I have with FOMO bulls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7705000","7707000"," They lose people money."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7707000","7709000"," And I never like to see that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7709000","7711000"," We can trade down until the end of the year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7711000","7713000"," We can trade down until next year."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7713000","7715000"," But it's always going to go up and down as we go down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7715000","7717000"," It's always going to go up and down as we go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7717000","7720000"," So you got, that's what it, that's the trap is that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7720000","7723000"," You get overly bearish or overly bullish."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7723000","7726000"," Yeah. Thanks for being here, guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7726000","7729000"," Ever considered Twitter spaces."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7729000","7730000"," Yeah."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7730000","7733000"," I was thinking about a very small."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7734000","7737000"," Discord or a Twitter spaces."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7737000","7739000"," I don't know which one."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7739000","7742000"," I don't know if you guys are interested in that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7742000","7743000"," It'd be nice."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7743000","7747000"," It's nice about having a very small discord, like one channel."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7747000","7752000"," Is that you guys can discuss as a group where you think we're going."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7752000","7757000"," Let's say you guys are all in there and you have the bear and bull perspective."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7758000","7761000"," For where the general market's going, the spy or in Q."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7761000","7762000"," I W M."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7765000","7766000"," Yeah, I've been flow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7766000","7767000"," Absolutely."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7767000","7769000"," You need to take different sides of the trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7769000","7773000"," At least you could be, at least you could be, Hey, I'm making money doing this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7773000","7775000"," You guys should cut where you're at and go into this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7775000","7777000"," We could discuss that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7777000","7779000"," But if you guys don't care for that stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7779000","7783000"," Or if you're another discord, I don't need to be clutter enough."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7783000","7785000"," Discords or spaces."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7786000","7788000"," It's more about getting this info."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7788000","7793000"," What I like about that handle is that I can try to get the live information to you as it happens."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7793000","7796000"," And then let you guys know what I'm trading."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7796000","7803000"," And then what I really like to do is just put a trading class out there so that all you guys can."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7803000","7805000"," You don't have to trade like me either."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7805000","7808000"," You can just nitpick things that I do to win."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7808000","7809000"," But I'm still here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7809000","7814000"," And that's important for you to understand is that a lot of traders, a lot of investors,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7814000","7815000"," they come and they go."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7815000","7816000"," They get burned."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7816000","7817000"," They get burned being too bullish."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7817000","7819000"," They get burned being too bearish."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7819000","7823000"," Most of the guys that make it in this market are women who never make it in this market"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7823000","7826000"," are flexible."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7826000","7834000"," They tend to buy investors that buy when things are low and have a breadth to what they buy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7834000","7837000"," Tend to make money and never really blow their account."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7837000","7843000"," So traders, same thing, be able to flip on a dime."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7843000","7845000"," To a different perspective."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7845000","7846000"," Yeah, absolutely."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7846000","7849000"," Being bisexual in the market."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7849000","7853000"," Even if you're at a mix of good points."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7853000","7857000"," Even if you can't take on a bull trade or a bear trade."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7857000","7864000"," Being able to know that the market is trend is changing."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7864000","7868000"," So that you at least don't trade is good enough."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7868000","7870000"," You don't have to trade both sides."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7871000","7879000"," But being bisexual in the market, as Adam was saying, still works if you at least only"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7879000","7883000"," take that one trade for that move."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7883000","7886000"," Rather than being committed all in."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7886000","7888000"," It's so dangerous."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7888000","7892000"," And then you got, like literally, let's just say, like we can do this for the bulls too,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7892000","7895400"," but let's say you're a bear and you're like, well, it doesn't matter what happens down here"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7895400","7898000"," as long as I hold it to my ultimate price target."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7899000","7903000"," It's the time exposure that you're in here as well, where you can get burned."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7903000","7906000"," So let's say, let's say you started."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7906000","7909000"," Let's say you started to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7909000","7911000"," A short."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7911000","7913000"," Airbnb from the top."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7913000","7914000"," Right."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7918000","7924000"," Let's say you do grab your short up here and you're just going to hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7925000","7929000"," We know that it's worked here on Airbnb because time has passed."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7929000","7934000"," But we also know oftentimes, this is a prime example right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7934000","7936000"," This is a fake out to shorts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7936000","7939000"," You get trapped in here and you capitulate."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7939000","7943000"," And it usually most of the time we continue to go up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7943000","7950000"," Now we are seasonally short right now and especially in this trade that there's a pretty good chance"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7950000","7952000"," it's going to happen here at the Airbnb."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7952000","7959000"," But we know because we see hedge funds blow up all the time from taking a short, but being"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7959000","7964000"," short consistently over time, just saying, well, I don't care about these moves right here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7964000","7967000"," I don't care about this move up as long as I stay on this resistance."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7967000","7968000"," I'm good to go."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7968000","7974000"," It's always better for you to take these shorts, right, remove them, let them come back up"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7974000","7976000"," and hit resistance, then take them again."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7976000","7979000"," And you can see that this is the same for the spy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7979000","7981000"," You trade the same way as a bear in the spy."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7981000","7983000"," You're looking for these hard bounces."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7983000","7985000"," Take another short up here."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7985000","7986000"," We didn't break above, right?"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7986000","7990000"," You could put a small call hedge wall up here to protect your shorts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7990000","7992000"," You know, you guys do it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7992000","7994000"," There's many different ways of doing this stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7994000","7995000"," You can sell calls."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7995000","7997000"," You can sell puts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7997000","7999000"," You don't always have to be buying."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","7999000","8005000"," But I want you guys to take more care and the risk that you're putting on for established"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8005000","8008000"," supports and resistances."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8008000","8009000"," Yeah, guys."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8009000","8012000"," I hope you guys all have a great rest of your Sunday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8012000","8016000"," I look forward to putting a video out later this afternoon or early this evening."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8016000","8019000"," I hope that I need to take a break and spend some time with my dogs today."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8019000","8021000"," I can take them for a walk."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8021000","8025000"," And I will have a short video for you for your trading day tomorrow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8025000","8027000"," I hope you all have a great holiday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8027000","8033000"," If you don't have family and I'm on Twitter and you want someone to just talk to you"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8033000","8035000"," and say, hey cap, I need someone to talk to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8036000","8040000"," I don't mind talking to any guys out there for a little bit, especially if you're lonely."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8040000","8043000"," I know COVID sucked for a lot of people."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8043000","8047000"," Even if, whether you believe it or not, you know, it's been tough out there for everybody."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8047000","8049000"," Even people that are anti mask."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8049000","8050000"," Nothing's the same."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8050000","8053000"," I was watching a video this week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8053000","8060000"," I was looking at some videos of large events, like parades, like Fourth of July parades,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8060000","8063000"," all these events, the Christmas events out in the public."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8063000","8068000"," And it's bizarre in a way to see that we don't do that stuff right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8068000","8073000"," Even when we were holding those events still right now, but then they're just not the same."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8073000","8075000"," And it bothered me."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8075000","8076000"," I was really bothered by that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8076000","8079000"," There's like a fabric part of our country."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8079000","8081000"," And I'm a masker."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8081000","8083000"," I'm a pro vaccine mask."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8083000","8086000"," I don't bring that into my politics into trading."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8086000","8090000"," But even with that being that person, I was heartbroken."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8090000","8095000"," Watching that stuff because there's a part of our, there's a, there's a trade off to how long we lock down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8095000","8100000"," And I'm not, I'm not down for lockdowns anymore. I did my part."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8100000","8105000"," I did it for almost two years and I won't lock down again personally."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8105000","8111000"," And then seeing that those, we're starting to lose what kind of makes us who we are."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8111000","8114000"," Lonely trader in it."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8114000","8116000"," Right on."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8116000","8117000"," Happy holidays."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8117000","8120000"," I'm going to be doing your shitmates right around Adam."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8120000","8122000"," Hope you all have a great holiday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8122000","8124000"," Love your families."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8124000","8127000"," Hold the ones that are your closest closest to you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8127000","8128000"," Keep them closer to you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8128000","8129000"," I'm getting older."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8129000","8135000"," So I want you to know that the people that are in your life most of the time,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8135000","8140000"," they become more and more important as you get older."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8140000","8143000"," You know, so keep them close."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8143000","8145000"," Yeah, Mel."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8145000","8146280"," Have a great holiday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8146280","8148120"," I will go live this week as well."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8148120","8150520"," I'll keep adding tickers every Sunday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8150520","8151600"," We'll start adding tickers."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8151600","8154400"," You don't have guys enough to worry about tickers right now."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8154400","8155440"," We're gonna start every Sunday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8155440","8157520"," We're gonna start building a database."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8157520","8159400"," I'll share this database with you"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8159400","8162440"," and you'll start to have all of these tickers"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8162440","8163760"," charted out for you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8163760","8166240"," You can always go back and see where we actually are,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8166240","8167880"," where we expected it to go."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8168840","8170560"," I'll put some bear tickers out there."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8170560","8172800"," Remind me next weekend on Sunday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8172800","8177680"," I'm gonna also show you guys how to look for stocks to short."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8177680","8179560"," So if any of you bears are out there,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8179560","8183200"," I will show you guys how to identify stocks"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8183200","8184600"," that are ready to get whacked."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8185840","8188920"," Not the ones that retail talk about."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8188920","8190600"," We're gonna talk about the ones where it's time"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8190600","8193560"," to take profit and a bank's doing it"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8193560","8194640"," and it's nice and mellow."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8194640","8196880"," It just goes down nice and slowly."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8196880","8198680"," No whammies from retail jumping in,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8198680","8200300"," no goofy news coming out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8202920","8204000"," Okay."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8204000","8206080"," So all, matter of fact, next week,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8206080","8209480"," I'll have a stack of tickers on both sides."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8209480","8211120"," Well, I've made this video now,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8211120","8213720"," so I'm not gonna go back into how to do this stuff."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8213720","8215360"," I'm just gonna go in and chart them out."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8215360","8217880"," We'll rapid fire them out next Sunday."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8217880","8219920"," I'll make sure that I have some bear tickers"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8219920","8221880"," and they have some bull tickers"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8221880","8223360"," and we'll start building this database."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8223360","8224200"," I'll share this."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8224200","8227000"," I'm gonna share it and invite with you on my handle"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8227000","8228800"," so you guys have access to these charts."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8228800","8230000"," I can share them to you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8230920","8235400"," And we'll start to streamline this process."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8235400","8237560"," Every Sunday, you'll get stocks."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8238400","8241480"," You'll get a daily brief whenever they're required."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8241480","8243120"," That's a recorded daily brief."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8244120","8246880"," That's just the indexes."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8246880","8248520"," And then I'll come live on with you"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8248520","8250880"," at key pivots throughout the week."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8250880","8252960"," And so that should be enough to get started."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8252960","8254360"," And in the background,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8254360","8259360"," I am right now currently creating a video series"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8260480","8261560"," to learn how to trade,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8261560","8264200"," learn how to trade stocks, options."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8264200","8266280"," I don't deal with crypto."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8266280","8269360"," I can if you want to do some crypto videos"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8269360","8271520"," or I can at least touch on crypto or oil and gas."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8271520","8273480"," I didn't get to go oil and gas and gold today"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8273480","8276360"," and precious metals I want to."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8276360","8278880"," If you guys want at least just basic updates every week,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8278880","8281680"," I can probably do that once a week for you."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8281680","8283960"," Maybe tonight's video if you want them."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8283960","8285760"," I love to write down almost as much as the write up."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8285760","8286880"," Yeah, absolutely."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8286880","8287920"," Write down is good."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8288760","8289840"," I like the write down."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8289840","8291560"," If you're a buyer, let's say you like a stock,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8291560","8294560"," if I like Tesla, I would love to own Tesla at 750."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8294560","8296040"," That makes me excited."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8296040","8298000"," I don't understand why anybody wouldn't like"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8298000","8299880"," wanting Tesla at 750."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8299880","8301080"," It blows my mind."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8301080","8303480"," When you say Tesla 2,200, I believe that."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8303480","8306040"," But if there was a moment where I could buy Tesla at 750,"
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8306040","8310560"," all in, all in, all in all day long."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8310560","8312960"," All right guys, I'll see you soon."
"qVwfuBq-D6U","8312960","8314760"," Have a great rest of your Sunday."
