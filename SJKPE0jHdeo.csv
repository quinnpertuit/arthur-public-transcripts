"SJKPE0jHdeo","577000","582000"," And then I was looking at some of the heavy hitters and tech."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","582000","585000"," This is last night about nine p.m. and."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","585000","590000"," Just on a daily weekly basis on some of these tickers that really do."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","590000","593000"," Impact and hold up our market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","593000","598000"," And I was slightly frightened by."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","599000","602000"," The financial sector in particular."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","602000","605000"," Some of the big tech names as well."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","605000","608000"," And some of the rotation that's going on out there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","608000","612000"," Can they resolve themselves as the question one right they can."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","612000","615000"," They can resolve themselves."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","615000","618000"," We're going to take a look at a few of those this morning."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","618000","622000"," Kind of this updated here expecting comments from a fed to Collins and."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","623000","625000"," In terms of the top of the hour."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","636000","637000"," Q and A."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","637000","641000"," So keep in mind a text is expected for feds Collins again at the top of the"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","641000","642000"," hour."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","642000","647000"," These tickers though I was looking at these tickers last night and I hadn't had a chance to"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","648000","652000"," really look around like take a breather look around the market and just see where"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","652000","654000"," everything out there is that."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","669000","674000"," The thing that rubbed my ass the wrong way with the financial sector last night is."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","675000","678000"," Again, Jerome Powell and."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","678000","681000"," Almost like a."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","681000","687000"," If you were a regional bank or a smaller bank and even credit card company."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","687000","690000"," Or even a larger bank."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","690000","695000"," You've got Jerome Powell telling the banks realtors."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","695000","701000"," Go go F yourself right we're going to stay higher for longer."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","702000","705000"," And I think that shock to."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","707000","709000"," Those institutions."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","711000","712000"," You know what it can do?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","712000","715000"," It's like rats on a ship right at a buddy last night asked me."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","715000","717000"," Well, what would those banks do?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","717000","720000"," Or he was listing off a bunch of stuff about."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","721000","723000"," The general public right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","723000","727000"," Mary on Main Street or Bob on Main Street."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","728000","729000"," And how."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","729000","737000"," They're in a bad place right they're going to continue to be in a bad place over the next year or let's say in a December of 2024."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","737000","743000"," And those banks being put on notice that the pain would continue."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","743000","750000"," And he asked me what do you think that those bank guys will do and I said the rats on a ship they they will."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","751000","754000"," They will they don't care about the man on Main Street."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","754000","756000"," They'll abandon ship as quickly as possible."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","758000","760000"," If there's that much more pain to come."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","760000","763000"," Can you imagine being a realtor in the United States right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","764000","768000"," And Jerome Powell just gave you the middle finger right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","769000","774000"," We're coming after you right we're going to come after you we're going to keep raising rates going to hold them for longer."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","774000","777000"," I don't believe that but I'm back to not believing it again."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","778000","779000"," I don't think we ever make it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","779000","784000"," I think that employment rate rises to a point where it starts to really impact."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","785000","787000"," Our economy and the stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","788000","790000"," I think is I think there's a lot of lines saying that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","790000","794000"," So the last night at nine nine o'clock I was I was watching this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","795000","797000"," The stock market and I was like man."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","798000","802000"," I was looking around and a lot of financials stocks yesterday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","803000","812000"," And it's it's smelled like rats is what it smelled like like like they like they would have no problem exiting stage left."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","813000","818000"," Well we don't know what's going on as far as a shutdown with the US government."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","821000","824000"," It doesn't matter if we're going to roll we're going to roll right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","824000","826000"," It's not going to be because of a shutdown."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","827000","836000"," I went back and look at looked at like thirteen instances of it and the market was going up or going down during those shutdowns."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","837000","841000"," So that's not going to really have as much of an impact as people wish or will tell you that it's going to."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","843000","847000"," But the banking sector that's the one where I've got my eye on them."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","847000","851000"," You got your eye cocked on them and you're like these guys over here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","852000","856000"," They're scumbags like these are the kind of people that are like."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","857000","867000"," You know like they're in red dawn they're the guy that I forget the guy's name the guy that ran a rannled or something like that a Ronald Randall."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","867000","879000"," He was like the mayor's son turns in all the red Don people and they're all like someone executed or something like that's what a banker is they don't care about you they don't care about their friends."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","880000","884000"," They will run at the first sight of any kind of bad news."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","885000","893000"," So we'll take a look at some of those tickers this morning and where the trap is on the upside for the S&P 500."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","894000","896000"," We talked about it briefly yesterday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","898000","902000"," So let's take a peek at we are short right now by the way so he's his positioning short here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","903000","909000"," So we will take a look at we already talked about rechecking yesterday's low."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","909000","914000"," We already talked about the gap to the downside that needs to be filled."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","914000","917000"," But we're going to also look higher from here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","917000","923000"," And you know I'm going to tell you what it reminds me I'm going to be honest with you what it reminds me of."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","924000","937000"," So far when it's the top of the talk about it President Collins as you to speak at the annual convention of the main bankers association where she will share perspectives on the economy and participate in a moderated Q&A."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","938000","943000"," So it's Collins there will be a text expected but there is no live stream for this event."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","944000","953000"," So that's a reminder as well as Collins is traditionally a centralist so not either hawkish or turn that off so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","954000","962000"," What it reminds me of is I think it was 2011 I could be wrong but I think it was 2011."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","963000","965000"," Late July early August."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","966000","973000"," It was the first time we had a downgrade I believe from Moody's or S&P 500."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","974000","980000"," I don't quote me on which one of those it was but we had received a downgrade."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","981000","990000"," From them and we had some we had some falling markets and stuff around the world and what happened to happen though is we had a flash crash."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","991000","1000000"," And we've already had downgrades from Moody's I believe we had movie Moody's and S&P at this point but we haven't really seen the effects of it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1001000","1010000"," Those downgrades are are kind of attached to these regional banks and then what Jerome had said over this past week."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1011000","1018000"," We start to put those things together and it makes you just go like huh right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1019000","1025000"," Where we didn't really see the damage from the downgrades in the past but now you've got Jerome."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1027000","1031000"," Taking a shot across the bow at all these banks that's basically what he's doing right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1032000","1035000"," I think all the banks are asking for was he will play ball for."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1036000","1042000"," The winter the fall the winter and maybe the spring and summer and Jerome's like fuck you know this is."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1043000","1045000"," I got charts until 2030 bro."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1046000","1048000"," Of course those charts don't mean shit but."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1049000","1050000"," That's definitely."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1051000","1055000"," Picking a fight moment right there was definitely some some fight picking."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1057000","1059000"," Going on in that speech so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1059000","1069000"," It smells bad and if you don't know that time period we had that role."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1070000","1075000"," It was really fast I think I think they called it black Monday or something like that don't quote me on that but."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1077000","1080000"," We like it was the same setup to right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1081000","1082000"," We like blast down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1083000","1086000"," Come into that weekend on a Friday everything seems fine."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1086000","1090000"," You wake up Monday morning and we're down six seven percent."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1091000","1096000"," So I think we're already down we'll measure how far down we are I think we're down for six percent or something like that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1096000","1103000"," Maybe down that you'd be down to get like ten twelve percent or something like that and make a major role to the downside so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1104000","1113000"," We'll measure and see where we are in this correction and find out what more could come what more blood could come how how ugly could it get."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1114000","1116000"," But it is concerning and."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1117000","1123000"," I don't think you can get rid of that concern I'm not bearish on this or anything or like yeah this is a thesis."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1124000","1131000"," But if you are an investor or a bot if you're an investor or a buyer or if you're a not a buyer mostly an investor."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1133000","1136000"," Or if you're a seller if you're if you're on sell side."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1137000","1143000"," Or you're an investor there is some key key things you need to watch for."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1144000","1150000"," Either before you re enter the market I would I'd be very hesitant to re enter the market where we are right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1151000","1157000"," Even if you were right buying here with size let's say you want to buy some of this don't buy some of that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1158000","1163000"," And also tech has not hit its weekly yet so tech has not hit its weekly."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1164000","1171000"," And there's a trap above for you waiting for you on a daily basis there is so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1172000","1179000"," You need to break above that that that momentum that's coming crashing down on the market right now and it's coming down right now it's still not here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1181000","1189000"," And there's also so you have to get past that and then check to make sure that that momentum is behind you before you can feel confident."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1190000","1197000"," To even breathe in this market okay so we'll we'll we'll look at that once again this morning."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1198000","1204000"," And see where that risk lies so let's take a quick look at that right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1207000","1214000"," And give me one quick second here I'm gonna make sure we don't flip to buy because I want to buy again this morning."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1215000","1219000"," And we're gonna go to the weebull chart here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1220000","1226000"," And we're gonna go to SPX we're gonna go to day chart I'm gonna hide all this stuff for you here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1227000","1230000"," And so I hide these drawings here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1231000","1236000"," And it's quite simple to see so just on SPX."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1237000","1249000"," And SPX if you are an investor or I want to put size on the market I don't mean like date or zero dates or fucking around an intraday basis."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1250000","1257000"," But if you are thinking to yourself this is the bottom and there's no more downside to come."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1258000","1263000"," I want to warn you of the 42 10 JPM collar into the end of the quarter."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1264000","1269000"," And I also want to draw your attention to this big fat white line right here."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","1274000","1276000"," I implore you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1277000","1278000"," I implore you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1279000","1303000"," To set up a 21 EMA on any chart that you have at home right click on it I think every software offers this most softwares and create yourself an alert for price crossing for price crossing to that line it won't matter when it is it won't matter if it's here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1304000","1311000"," And this is your this is your place right here. So if you're if you're a bear."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1312000","1314000"," You're looking for that."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","1319000","1321000"," And if you're a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1327000","1328000"," If you're a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1328000","1330000"," You're looking to get over this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1331000","1333000"," To even even be sniffing freedom."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1334000","1340000"," It's like if you're a bull you need to actually break above this and likely fail."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1341000","1342000"," Somewhere in there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1343000","1346000"," And then come back down as this white line actually reverses."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1348000","1349000"," This this reverse here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1350000","1353000"," And you're actually not out of the you're not actually out still as a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1354000","1358000"," You're not out of the you're not actually out still as a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1359000","1361000"," You're not out of the woods."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1362000","1364000"," Unless this bounces here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1367000","1374000"," So if you're like hey I want to be bullish on this market I want to get back into this market that was a great pullback woohoo everything is awesome."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1375000","1379000"," You're actually still waiting until you have the break above."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1379000","1384000"," Get the new a new high new high from this date back here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1385000","1387000"," We that's the 14th or something like that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1388000","1392000"," And then start that that continuation to the upside over here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1397000","1400000"," The onus is on you as the bull to wait for that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1401000","1404000"," There will be times where you would have been right buying the bottom today."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1405000","1406000"," But I assure you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1411000","1413000"," It's not safe and if you would run that trade."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1416000","1424000"," Ten times you would win three of those ten times so it better be a winner right it better like pay big time for you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1426000","1428000"," And be it be assured I'm going to assure you that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1428000","1435000"," The sellers are here waiting to send you to below your weekly trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1436000","1438000"," And down here to close this gap down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1440000","1446000"," Into you know the first week of October second week of October something like that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1447000","1449000"," So you do not want to be caught in this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1450000","1453000"," You don't want to be caught in here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1454000","1457000"," This is bad right you put a hundred grand on this you put thirty forty three."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1458000","1459000"," You put fifty grand on this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1460000","1464000"," Whatever you lose this money it's no fun it's it's it's never a fun experience so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1466000","1470000"," Be conscious of this trap to the upside as it comes down upon you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1472000","1476000"," Do I think we can trade all this up yeah I do I think we can trade most of this up I think we can trade likely."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1477000","1478000"," Some of this gap here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1480000","1482000"," So do I think we can go up here absolutely."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1483000","1488000"," But I will but like this stream let's talk about this stream really quick."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1489000","1490000"," How this stream works."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1491000","1495000"," We explain how this stream works here I'm going to show you exactly how the stream works."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1496000","1497000"," All right I'm going to show you this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1501000","1502000"," How this stream works so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1502000","1513000"," Can you put some short term risk on to the upside here fuck yeah."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1514000","1518000"," Does our stream do that some do most don't."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1519000","1523000"," Right you take that trade high we take this trade higher here right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1525000","1526000"," We're blasting up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1527000","1529000"," And assuredly."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1531000","1538000"," The lotus cacophony in the stream at this point right here is pick up I'm really bullish here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1539000","1544000"," And I want to get long when they should have gotten long down here right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1547000","1550000"," So this person that got long down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1552000","1554000"," They're actually exiting right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1556000","1560000"," While the lotus voice in the room is saying I want to get long here right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1561000","1563000"," Now if there is a break above."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1565000","1568000"," Right we bounced down here and start heading up here to go higher."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1569000","1571000"," That would have been this guy's next entry right right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1572000","1575000"," This guy right here would be getting out there getting back in over here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1576000","1578000"," Meanwhile this guy was just getting long."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1578000","1584000"," He's like yeah I'm making money and then bam he gets sent right back down and he's at zero or less."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1585000","1587000"," Right because of time decay."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1588000","1590000"," Meanwhile this guy is just jumping on board."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1591000","1592000"," We're coming back up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1594000","1601000"," And that guy down there with this guy with the white arrow he's just getting busy in here again right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1602000","1605000"," And the roll comes to the downside so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1606000","1613000"," The roll back actually comes back down and this thing's rolled back up now and you're you're actually trying to get back in down here so."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1614000","1616000"," Be conscious of that okay."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1617000","1622000"," This guy with this white arrow guy is always late to the party."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1623000","1626000"," So this is the time for you to put on some risk."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1627000","1630000"," Be aware of SPX 439144."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1631000","1634000"," So kind of failure to close this gap to the upside that's your first target."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1635000","1637000"," Your second target is somewhere up in here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1638000","1641000"," You'll be putting risk on here and here not financial advice."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1642000","1652000"," And then you'll be waiting for this this blast back down and this is actually where you put your risk on right here right where this flat part is that flat part and that flat part."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1653000","1654000"," And you're not bullish."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1656000","1660000"," Until this reversal right here right that's where you enter again right there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1662000","1664000"," And you do not get trapped."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1665000","1670000"," You do not get trapped for any reversals here right then that case."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1671000","1676000"," You're not getting sent back down to the depths of hell here you're not getting sent back down to the depths of hell here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1677000","1680000"," You're not getting sent back down to the depths of hell here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1682000","1686000"," Does that make sense you have your stops here you have your stops right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1688000","1691000"," You have your stops right here you have your stops right here make sense."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1691000","1695280"," here make sense so you're not actually buying this bullshit in here to get"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1695280","1698840"," rolled you're not buying this bullshit here you're not buying this bullshit right"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1698840","1703240"," here and getting rolled down almost guaranteed knockdowns in those zones"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1703240","1709280"," right there so keep I want to keep an eye on this as the days move forward I'll be"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1709280","1714160"," watching it as well you may be wondering why I'm scared of this stuff I'm gonna"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1714160","1720960"," show you I'll show you a few things just quickly here's one right here this"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1720960","1726840"," visa one right here looking pretty sickly right visa not looking so hot right"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1726840","1732880"," now it's coming right down here to check its weekly trend down here at a"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1732880","1740360"," 233 straight to 236 right now but it's weekly trend usually pretty bad right"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1740360","1745920"," this is the mid-may pullback for visa let's just look at two prior examples we"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1745920","1749680"," have one where we bounced immediately here we still haven't even touched it"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1749760","1755800"," this one we blasted right through this one we blasted right through now it's"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1755800","1759520"," just be really conscious of this stuff you start blasting through this and we"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1759520","1764560"," get into middle of October November and you start looking down here at 214 and"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1764560","1771760"," it's not pretty is it not pretty right I'm gonna show you one other thing here"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1771760","1781040"," really quick so we can switch over to cycles"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1781040","1803080"," and we're on PMO and PPO cycles here and the PMO and PPO cycles are not"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1803080","1809800"," convinced either are they we still have the blue below the red we did not have a"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1809840","1815120"," signal to go long yet down below here and PPO PMOs so you're not seeing the"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1815120","1827320"," reversal yet right the reversal cross yet there's no signal here to go long is"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1827320","1831320"," there there's no signal right there to go long is there same thing down below"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1831320","1838720"," right still on a downward decline here still not showing that turn around yet"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1838720","1843120"," you always want to see that turn you want to see this turn you want that"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1843120","1847240"," confirmation of turn to putting risk on the market not seeing it here not"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1847240","1855120"," seeing it here cause for concern in the background we're not concerned just cause"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1855120","1861040"," for if you were to take this trade you know ten times yeah it might reverse you"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1861040","1864800"," might be like yeah I caught it early but oftentimes a little bit more to go to"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1864800","1870200"," the downside right we haven't had that V shape recovery yet so there's concern"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1870200","1877600"," here there's some there's most most assuredly not a place for you to not a"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1877600","1892600"," place for you to not a place yet for you to what do I say relax your guard right"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1892600","1896760"," now like taking your guard off the market"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1898560","1904360"," I'm getting a check right now and see if there's a long signal coming up a little"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1904360","1907800"," bit of a pullback here we want to see this cross right is a one minute chart on"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1907800","1917000"," spy we want to see come up blast up tag and then start heading higher here so"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1917000","1921240"," we'll take a look on spy and see if that will happen"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1923440","1926440"," now but there's two takers there's a whole bunch of miles looking at last"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1926440","1936240"," night I was looking at Vicks last night and it's just suspect it shouldn't be but"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1936240","1941080"," it is suspect here I find it kind of unique that we're touching the the"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1941080","1947880"," 129 almost to a pin strike on SPX no breakthrough on SPX"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1949920","1955920"," what's going on here that's what it is"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1958120","1965160"," so no no breakthrough yet an SPX it's like a perfect perfect pin strike on SPX"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1965160","1969560"," on the 129 and they're not always that clean you have like you have the"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1969560","1975120"," continued breakdown below it I always like to see like I always like to see"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1975120","1979720"," like we don't touch it or we break through it I don't like seeing the exact"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1979720","1986480"," pin strike on a daily basis on SPX on the 129 EMA it's very rare to see something"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1986480","1992960"," like that so so I would I would remain on guard"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1992960","1999920"," go to remain on guard if you are a bull in the medium term short-term bullish"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","1999920","2009040"," but on the medium term very cautious as a bull here very very cautious is a bull"

"SJKPE0jHdeo","9657140","9667140"," I got to be quiet here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9667140","9674140"," So much fucking drama."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9675140","9682140"," I mean, you know what this makes me think here?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9682140","9685140"," This makes me even fucking angry."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9685140","9688140"," Like this makes me so fucking angry, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9688140","9691140"," That I want to fucking know."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9691140","9693140"," I'm like, I'll just hold this shit into the fucking, I'll hold it to 4."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9693140","9694140"," Fuckin' PM."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9694140","9695140"," Get fucked."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9695140","9698140"," Now I want fucking $45,000."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9698140","9701140"," Get fuck dealer."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9702140","9704140"," I want a year of salary today."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9704140","9705140"," Still fuck off."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9705140","9709140"," Give me my money."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9709140","9718140"," I'm like seriously."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9718140","9726140"," I mean, like seriously."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9727140","9732140"," Like this makes me angry as fuck here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9732140","9734140"," Why am I trading against my trigger here?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9734140","9737140"," Because it's not just triggers."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9737140","9738140"," It's not just triggers."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9738140","9741140"," There's a velocity that matters here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9741140","9744140"," Then you got gammon shit like that that I watched in the background."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9744140","9747140"," So that's why I'm trading against it right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9747140","9749140"," It's not just triggers."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9749140","9753140"," It's the velocity behind them too."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9753140","9755140"," You don't trade triggers."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9755140","9757140"," You're out of your fucking mind."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9757140","9759140"," If you trade triggers, you don't have an edge."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9759140","9760140"," You need the velocity."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9760140","9762140"," The velocity is where you get the edge."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9762140","9765140"," That's how you know it holds or fails."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9765140","9768140"," Good question, by the way."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9768140","9770140"," Triggers don't mean shit."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9770140","9771140"," You need the velocity."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9771140","9775140"," It tells you if they'll hold, break."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9775140","9779140"," If they're supportive, restrictive, if they'll sell off them, if you'll break through them."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9779140","9781140"," It's a very good question."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9782140","9785140"," I would not be doing that if I didn't think I had velocity on my side."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9785140","9787140"," It's a very good question."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9791140","9792140"," You got it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9792140","9795140"," You guys know what I'm talking about."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9795140","9800140"," So I can tell to a certain degree, depending on where velocity is,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9800140","9807140"," I can give a fair estimate if it's going to hold, break through, that kind of shit."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9808140","9811140"," So like a velocity right now is an example."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9811140","9814140"," So on that half hour velocity, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9814140","9815140"," It's not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9815140","9818140"," So the half hour trigger is a minor trigger to start with."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9818140","9820140"," It's not a major trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9820140","9822140"," It's a minor trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9822140","9825140"," But then, so when we were going down into this half hour,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9825140","9827140"," let me show you something cool."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9827140","9829140"," You want to see something cool?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9829140","9832140"," So this moved down right here, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9832140","9835140"," If velocity was at plus 25 or plus 50,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9835140","9839140"," this shit would have went to the depths of hell."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9839140","9848140"," If it was at minus 25 minus 50, it would hold."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9848140","9850140"," If it was at minus 25, it would hold."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9850140","9855140"," If it was at zero, it should hold, but like plus 25 plus 50,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9855140","9858140"," not so so confident in it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9858140","9862140"," Another problem too is higher time frame velocities."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9863140","9868140"," Where are the higher time frame velocities in relation to these lower time frame velocities?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9868140","9872140"," Also impact if they hold or not, if you break through them or not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9872140","9878140"," So if we were on the flip side of velocity, I would not be trying to buy that depth."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9878140","9882140"," I would be like, get out of the way, it's going to break and we're going to go much lower."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9882140","9886140"," But why am I telling people not to be down there buying?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9886140","9889140"," Because it's still fucking risky as fuck."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9889140","9893140"," And it's very dangerous and you're going to lose all your money."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9893140","9895140"," And it's very risky."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9895140","9899140"," So it's still very risky."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9903140","9905140"," No, I'm not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9905140","9907140"," I think I'm on the right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9907140","9909140"," I think I know what I'm talking about."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9909140","9914140"," So I'm going to play a two card Chicago stud with."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9915140","9922140"," Dealers today and hedge funds that they're going to close out by 345 330 320."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9922140","9924140"," And ride this shit all the way up."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9924140","9926140"," So."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9926140","9929140"," If they had done it earlier, I wouldn't."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9929140","9935140"," It's like if we blasted higher on the open this morning, if we'd like said, rip and face to the hourly."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9935140","9937140"," I would not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9937140","9939140"," Be confident."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9939140","9941140"," So this just looks to me."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9941140","9945140"," What I'm looking at here, what looks to me like."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9945140","9950140"," They're going to hold this shit to the last part of the day."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9950140","9952140"," So they're going to try to grind out all the puts."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9952140","9957140"," They're going to try to not pay the calls and they're going to try to push it up into the end of the bell."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9957140","9962140"," And whatever is left over the weekend, they'll kill with theta on Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9962140","9966140"," Whatever is left upside moving into Monday, they'll try to kill."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9967140","9974140"," And it's also sets up the door for the daily 21 EMA to come down and meet up on Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9974140","9984140"," So there's like some function or the some mechanics in the price of the market that I play here right now farther down the road into Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9984140","9992140"," Now, if we had traded up to the early trigger on the open this morning, like straight up blasted up to it and sold off of it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","9992140","10000140"," I would be not buying dips until we were then above the early trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10000140","10002140"," I wouldn't trust it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10002140","10013140"," But because we haven't traded that yet today, we're likely going to smash into it by close and likely above it to over the weekend."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10013140","10016140"," But they're going to fuck your options up because of the weekend."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10016140","10030140"," And then we'll have a we'll have a date with the daily trigger early next week for a major cell or a major seller or a breakthrough."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10030140","10032140"," You guys got Yum Kapoor on Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10032140","10042140"," No shit."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10042140","10045140"," RSI is dog shit indicator."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10045140","10050140"," Never ever trust RSI."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10050140","10052140"," Not an RSI trader."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10052140","10055140"," I used to be a VWAP trader for a time period."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10055140","10058140"," Used like trading VWAP don't trade it anymore."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10058140","10063140"," This is the most consistent back tested system I've ever found."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10063140","10064140"," Period."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10064140","10065140"," I find a better one."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10065140","10071140"," I want to see it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10072140","10080140"," Yeah, you guys are going to get the edge."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10080140","10083140"," You guys are going to get this week next week."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10083140","10087140"," You guys are going to get it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10087140","10100140"," The wild part about it too is like classic set up so you can actually see how they get how they get defeated by these like half hour triggers will be hiding out and stuff."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10101140","10103140"," I'm going to try to sell it down again on me."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10103140","10104140"," They're stinky right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10104140","10106140"," It's probably some guy in an office."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10106140","10108140"," It had fun going fuck this guy."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10108140","10110140"," I'm going to sell it down in his ass."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10110140","10112140"," Like calling upstairs like boss."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10112140","10115140"," I just want to sell 50 million really quick to fuck this guy up."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10115140","10124140"," Him and all his buddies."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10124140","10126140"," You guys think that shit ain't real."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10126140","10129140"," It is."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10129140","10130140"," Trust me."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10130140","10131140"," It's real."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10131140","10134140"," When I say that shit, you guys think I'm joking."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10134140","10137140"," I'm not fucking joking."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10137140","10140140"," We get like 5,000 people telling all their friends and shit."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10140140","10142140"," They're all buying calls at the same time."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10142140","10151140"," That's like fucking 10,000 people fucking spreading around 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 grand."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10151140","10152140"," Make an impact."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10152140","10154140"," They're fucking watching."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10154140","10155140"," I guarantee it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10156140","10173140"," Yeah, we ran a."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10173140","10174140"," We ran."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10174140","10175140"," We did it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10175140","10178140"," We did the math one day."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10178140","10179140"," We did the math."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10179140","10184140"," We were like, okay, so we went back and looked like, well, go on like Twitter."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10184140","10188140"," And I'll do like a four trigger bull cluster."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10188140","10195140"," And it'll be in front of the eyes of like 7,000 people, 10,000 people will see it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10195140","10200140"," So like figure if I get on fin to it and say, um, four trigger bull cluster."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10200140","10203140"," Spoons, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10203140","10209140"," You figure 7,000 people saw that and then probably talk to some of them talk to their friends about it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10209140","10215140"," We have people that we have this stream is rebroadcast in Europe and it's rebroadcast."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10215140","10219140"," And, uh, and blogs and discords."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10219140","10222140"," I've been asked people have asked me to, if they can restream this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10222140","10224140"," So you've got all those people."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10224140","10229140"," So let's say you get like anywhere from 10 to 20,000 people that know that you're long."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10229140","10234140"," Uh, it doesn't mean it's going up, but it does mean that it impacts, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10234140","10237140"," It just means it doesn't mean anything in itself."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10237140","10247140"," But if I was a fund and I knew that, uh, potentially 20,000 people were buying puts or buying calls or short or long."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10247140","10252140"," Um, that's scary, right? I would be scared of it. I'd be like, how much money is that?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10252140","10256140"," Uh, you know, you might be trading a thousand bucks, but."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10256140","10264140"," There is a large percentage of those people that are likely trading five, 10, $20,000 or more."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10264140","10266140"," And that shit adds up, dude. Quickly."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10266140","10268140"," Very quickly."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10281140","10284140"," You guys want to know what I do? So you guys can't see all this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10284140","10292140"," Um, of course I'm watching book map and then I'm watching, uh, the tool in the background, I keep open, uh, at a minimum."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10293140","10298140"," Uh, I'll keep open some kind of news squawk or news feed."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10298140","10302140"," Uh, I play it for you here so you guys can."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10302140","10311140"," Uh, here, uh, I use financial juice. I used to use, um, I used to use, um, um, trade the news."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10311140","10315140"," They're a great company. They're very expensive. Um,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10315140","10319140"," And I don't trade to the news as much as I used to."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10320140","10324140"," Uh, I'll pretty much tell you what the news is going to be dependent where we are."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10324140","10332140"," Um, in the background, though, I do cycle through sectors cycle through the S&P 500 sectors."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10332140","10336140"," Uh, I have some screeners to my right that you can't see."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10336140","10340140"," I've got a, uh, daisy chained computing set up."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10340140","10344140"," So they're chained together with, um,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10344140","10352140"," Uh, El Gato, uh, uh, graphics cards."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10352140","10356140"," So I David Daisy chain computer computers together."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10356140","10362140"," And, um, on this other computer, I have, I've got screeners set up on the wall."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10362140","10367140"," And, uh, I look at the sectors like I'll look at XLF XLK."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10367140","10371140"," I'll look at a doctor copper. I'll look at oil."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10372140","10379140"," Um, I watch the VIX, the trifecta for me, if I had to call it would be, uh, VIX Dixie,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10379140","10383140"," H Y G, VIX Dixie, H Y G."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10385140","10389140"," Uh, and I watch NASDAQ. I don't watch IWM as much as I used to."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10391140","10395140"," Uh, I watch Apple a lot or whatever the driving ticker is in the market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10395140","10397140"," So let's say Apple's dying, but Nvidia's carrying the market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10397140","10399140"," I'll switch over to NVDA."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10401140","10411140"," And if we're at inflection points in the market, it's time to check those things."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10411140","10414140"," So whenever you feel like you're at an inflection point in the market,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10414140","10416140"," where we can go one way or the other in a major way,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10416140","10420140"," I cycle through those sectors and see what they're telling."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10420140","10422140"," Like are they, are they telling anything?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10422140","10429140"," Another key point here too is that, uh, H Y G is a classic leading indicator."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10430140","10434140"," If you were to do a comparison of H Y G and spoos."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10436140","10439140"," You do a, like you overlay one over the other."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10439140","10445140"," You can see H Y G, uh, divergences in spy."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10445140","10449140"," So the H Y G will diverge up or down from spy."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10449140","10453140"," And then spy will follow that divergence."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10453140","10458140"," Uh, doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen a lot."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10460140","10464140"," So H Y G, if you like, if you guys want something special out there for you, it's H Y G."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10467140","10474140"," Uh, trading for 33 48 right now, 45 trying to get a nice fat squeeze and finally trade that H T for 54 50."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10474140","10492140"," The logic behind H Y G as an indicator is that it has a, it follows the S and P 500, the stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10492140","10496140"," Uh, quite closely."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10496140","10501140"," So if H Y G is going down, S and P is likely going down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10501140","10508140"," There's oftentimes a, uh, divergence in H Y G and spoos."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10508140","10514140"," So H Y G is going up spy is going down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10514140","10522140"," And you're, you're saying, why is spy not following H Y G up?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10522140","10527140"," And I'm bearish here because spy is going down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10528140","10530140"," But H Y G is saying, fuck, no, it's up."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10530140","10531140"," We're going up, bro."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10531140","10533140"," Get long."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10533140","10534140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10534140","10536140"," And the inverse is true as well."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10536140","10541140"," If you, if you're seeing spy cranking and H Y G is going down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10541140","10547140"," It's telling you, um, do not follow that money up higher on spy."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10547140","10549140"," Does that make sense?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10549140","10555140"," Uh, the last part here that has to do with H Y G is, uh, hi, H Y G is a dog shit."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10556140","10557140"," Risk."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10557140","10560140"," It's risk appetite for the bond market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10560140","10567140"," So, uh, the old adage of the bond market knows better than the stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10567140","10575140"," Uh, if people are willing to risk money in, um, high risk bonds."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10575140","10580140"," Then that's an, that's an indicator to you to put risk on in the market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10580140","10581140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10582140","10584140"," Where it is, what's risk in the market?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10584140","10590140"," Tesla, Apple, uh, spec growth, all that kind of stuff."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10590140","10593140"," We went over H Y G yesterday too, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10593140","10597140"," You guys remember in the morning yesterday, we were looking at H Y G."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10597140","10600140"," And H Y G right now is here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10600140","10602140"," Let's go and look at it right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10602140","10604140"," Um, we're going to take a look at something really cool."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10604140","10607140"," We looked at it yesterday in stream and the day before."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10608140","10610140"," Uh, and I think the week before we did this too."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10610140","10613140"," And last month I talked about this on Twitter."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10613140","10618140"," And, uh, I got a lot of blowback for that post on Twitter."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10618140","10625140"," I got a lot of like anger from, uh, people on fin twits saying you can't do that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10625140","10631140"," And, uh, the bond market is the bond market, believe it or not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10631140","10635140"," So the bond market, believe it or not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10636140","10639140"," Is, uh, or rip."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10639140","10643140"," The bond market right now is not believing the stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10643140","10648140"," Uh, and they're not believing price."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10648140","10653140"," So let me go to a one day here and show you what I'm talking about."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10653140","10656140"," Spoons squeezing right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10656140","10659140"," But I want to show you something important."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10659140","10660140"," Okay."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10660140","10662140"," If you are a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10663140","10665140"," I'm going to tell you something here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10665140","10668140"," If you're a bull, I know that you hear me say things like it's all over the bulls."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10668140","10670140"," They had their run."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10670140","10671140"," They're done."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10671140","10673140"," Uh, the, uh,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10673140","10677140"," the HYG is telling you that is not true."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10677140","10680140"," Oh, yeah, man."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10680140","10682140"," I'm trading 49 right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10682140","10686140"," So HYG is telling you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10686140","10690140"," HYG is, I want you to see this right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10691140","10698140"," So I want to show you what bearishness looks like for S and P 500."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10698140","10700140"," This is HYG."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10700140","10701140"," Okay."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10701140","10704140"," You see H, H, HYG rolling down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10704140","10705140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10705140","10710140"," Do you see the break of the blue line with the yellow and the orange line right here?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10710140","10711140"," Pretty easy, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10711140","10713140"," It's pretty simple to figure out here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10713140","10716140"," You see that orange line trading down?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10716140","10719140"," See that yellow line trading down below the blue line."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10719140","10720140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10720140","10722140"," Do you know what that's called?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10722140","10727140"," It's called risk off."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10727140","10729140"," In the equity market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10729140","10733140"," HYG is telling you get the fuck out, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10733140","10737140"," Uh, HYG is just now crossing."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10737140","10742140"," To the upside or the yellow and orange is just now crossing."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10742140","10744140"," Above the blue line."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10744140","10747140"," Uh, when we're below the blue line, it's very negative."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10747140","10750140"," We're now crossing the blue line to the upside."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10750140","10755140"," That's actually extremely bullish for the stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10755140","10759140"," And I want to, I want to go further with this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10759140","10769140"," I want to go further with this and we were looking at this yesterday and earlier in the week."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10769140","10775140"," And we're just getting the normalization of the bond market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10776140","10780140"," I know this is counter to everything you're hearing right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10780140","10782140"," Everything."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10782140","10788140"," Uh, and you know what happens when you get the normalization of the bond market or not the"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10788140","10791140"," bond market, but the risk on book part of the bond market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10791140","10793140"," It gets very volatile."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10793140","10797140"," And these sellers don't want to see this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10797140","10800140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10800140","10803140"," They don't want to see this down here, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10804140","10809140"," Because this points towards 4,805,000."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10809140","10814140"," And I want you to, I want you to pay close attention to."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10814140","10817140"," This right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10817140","10822140"," When you have monthly trigger, weekly trigger, daily trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10822140","10824140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10824140","10827140"," And price begins to stabilize here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10827140","10830140"," Not just stabilize, but stay above here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10831140","10834140"," The market will rage to the upside."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10834140","10840140"," And one of the key key factors of this is this monthly trigger being on the bottom."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10840140","10845140"," If this, if this daily trigger was down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10845140","10848140"," And if this weekly trigger was down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10848140","10851140"," And price was rolling down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10851140","10854140"," It would be an extremely bearish."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10854140","10857140"," Uh, outlook on the stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10857140","10860140"," So let me, let me, let me show you this really quick here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10860140","10862140"," Squeezing right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10862140","10866140"," Um, if."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10866140","10875140"," If this daily trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10875140","10878140"," Was crossing down below."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10878140","10883140"," This weekly trigger was crossing down below."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10884140","10886140"," This monthly trigger, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10886140","10891140"," And price was following it on, on, uh, HYG."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10891140","10893140"," Down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10893140","10898140"," Uh, this is what's, this would be considered risk off, uh, stock market."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10898140","10901140"," This is actually a risk off sign."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10901140","10905140"," On stock market, but."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10905140","10908140"," We're not at the top, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10909140","10912140"," Uh, so the prime example right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10912140","10913140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10913140","10915140"," Orange, yellow crashing down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10915140","10916140"," Orange didn't go though."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10916140","10918140"," Did it stayed up, didn't it?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10918140","10920140"," Squeeze all the way up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10920140","10924140"," Orange telling you, uh, risk off, but not too dangerous, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10924140","10926140"," Step that orange line."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10926140","10930140"," Oh dangerous or how that orange line did not cross with HYG."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10930140","10932140"," See that big cross right here with HYG."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10932140","10934140"," That's huge risk off."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10935140","10937140"," Now you've got that orange line crossing back above."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10937140","10939140"," You got that yellow line crossing back above."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10939140","10943140"," It's telling you, uh, if you're a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10943140","10948140"," It's telling you don't believe the scary stories."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10948140","10953140"," It's telling you we're just getting started."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10953140","10957140"," For a major bull run here, believe it or not."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10957140","10959140"," Now saying all that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10960140","10964140"," When I tell you to be patient as a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10964140","10969140"," What you don't want to see here is HYG."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10969140","10971140"," Move up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10971140","10975140"," Close that gap and then immediately start selling."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10975140","10976140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10976140","10980140"," This would be the S and P 500 rolling back over and down and then getting all those roles"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10980140","10981140"," alongside it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10981140","10982140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10982140","10984140"," So we're not out of the way."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10985140","10987140"," For that bull story."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10987140","10990140"," That bull story isn't being told yet."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10990140","10995140"," You know that that huge sunshine rainbows and you know, uh, rainbow farts coming out."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10995140","10996140"," Your bull ass."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10996140","10997140"," Is not there right yet."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","10997140","11002140"," But but HYG right now is telling a different story than."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11002140","11010140"," HYG is telling a different story."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11011140","11018140"," Then HYG is telling a different story than the stock market is telling."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11018140","11021140"," HYG is telling a story of."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11021140","11026140"," Uh, we're going there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11026140","11032140"," And here's something else fascinating."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11032140","11035140"," Here's S and P 500 right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11036140","11041140"," Uh, HYG is relative to S and P 500 right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11041140","11046140"," That's where S, that's where HYG is right now relative to S and P 500."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11046140","11050140"," So HYG is telling you, well, we're just right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11050140","11053140"," So expect a blast up on spy again."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11053140","11054140"," You see that?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11054140","11057140"," So like HYG is saying, fuck you, no."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11057140","11060140"," We're just getting started on a bull run."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11060140","11064140"," That we're not actually even, we're not even, we're not even there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11064140","11069140"," So if you track HYG, HYG is saying to you."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11069140","11074140"," Uh, it's kind of like being tapped on the shoulder."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11074140","11078140"," It's being tapped on the shoulder and saying."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11078140","11079140"," Hey, cap."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11079140","11083140"," Uh, I know that you think S and P 500's had a great run, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11083140","11084140"," Congratulations."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11084140","11085140"," S B 500."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11085140","11087140"," And of course I'm getting scared going."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11087140","11090140"," Well, is this the top for a spy, right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11090140","11092140"," Is it the top or not?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11092140","11096140"," Uh, is this, is the run over until springtime of, uh, 2024."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11096140","11099140"," And HYG is like, no, man, we're just getting started, bro."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11099140","11102140"," We got, we got a fucking run to do here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11102140","11103140"," Right?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11103140","11105140"," Like we're just getting going."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11105140","11110140"," So if you are our bull, that's your, that's the one you're watching."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11110140","11111140"," You're a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11111140","11115140"," You're a Tesla bull and Apple bull and NVDA bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11115140","11119140"," If you're a bull, you're a Tesla bull and Apple bull and NVDA bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11119140","11122140"," If you're a fucking, whatever bull you are out there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11122140","11139140"," You are with, with apt attention watching, uh, high, uh, high yield growth."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11139140","11144140"," Yeah, you guys, you guys are looking for, you guys, you guys should be watching closely."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11145140","11146140"," HYG."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11146140","11154140"," If you're a bull, if you're, if your thesis is still bullish, if your thesis is still up."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11157140","11161140"," You're watching HYG as like a fucking hawk right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11162140","11168140"," Like you are like all attention on HYG because HYG is the entire thesis for bulls."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11168140","11176140"," But bull is for balls, B-O-L-L-S."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11185140","11189140"," It's the entire thesis rests on, on the bond market on risk."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11190140","11195140"," Your whole thesis, your whole thesis rests on some fucking old fat white guy."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11196140","11198140"," Who's a bond trader."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11199140","11201140"," A risk, risk on bond trader."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11202140","11204140"," That's not that risky to be honest, but."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11206140","11208140"," It's not like the risk of an equity trader."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11217140","11218140"," No, man."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11220140","11222140"," You guys got a bunch of gamma on your side too."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11222140","11224140"," You guys have a bunch of fucking."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11225140","11230140"," You guys have a, you guys have some gamma working for you too, if you're a bull."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11231140","11233140"," You got a whole bunch of gamma working on your side."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11233140","11236140"," Then you got a whole bunch of hedge funds that are going to close out and take the money and run."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11237140","11241140"," And you got a whole bunch of, bunch of fucking like, they got to unload a bunch of puts to people."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11242140","11244140"," They need buyers for puts with fear."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11244140","11246140"," And then they're going to squeeze this shit to the moon."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11246140","11248140"," So you guys are going to get a Vanna rally."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11248140","11251140"," They're going to try to be a Vanna rally here soon."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","11251140","11253140"," So stay tuned for your Vanna."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12064140","12066140"," They chase all that up to the upside."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12066140","12069140"," We close all this out into end of month."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12069140","12078140"," So what is the plan heading into end of the month."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12078140","12085140"," The plan is that we trade this into end of month."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12086140","12090140"," The plan is also."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12090140","12096140"," If at any moment."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12096140","12101140"," Now one problem we have here is that puts were rolled and not taken off right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12101140","12106140"," Or or like the or the thesis of I'm like."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12106140","12108140"," Do we have new money coming to the market right now."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12113140","12114140"," No."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12114140","12117140"," If there was no fear down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12117140","12121140"," Then all the shorts and puts would come off and not get rolled right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12121140","12124140"," We'd have bigger data possibility right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12124140","12131140"," But they're rolling into new puts below 430 right more new protection down here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12131140","12137140"," So for right now this is this is what you're trying to trade in the end of month."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12137140","12142140"," Now the only time you're going to get super duper bullish for a squeeze is if we're above."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12160140","12163140"," Here and here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12164140","12174140"," My expectation for right now would be."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12174140","12179140"," That the dealers don't care if we squeeze up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12179140","12182140"," They don't care if we squeeze up here in a Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12182140","12185140"," All they need to care about is that they're selling this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12185140","12188140"," Or that they're selling this on Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12188140","12190140"," That's it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12190140","12191140"," Does it make sense."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12191140","12194140"," So right in here they want to keep this down in here for next week."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12194140","12199140"," So the expectation for next week into Friday would be."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12199140","12202140"," That we trade this zone right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12202140","12205140"," Let's see if I can show you guys the."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12205140","12208140"," This picture really quick."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12236140","12237140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12237140","12241140"," So do they want to print all this shit right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12241140","12243140"," Fuck no."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12243140","12244140"," Same answer."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12244140","12246140"," Do they want to print all this shit right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12246140","12247140"," Fuck no."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12247140","12248140"," Right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12249140","12250140"," They want to print any of that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12250140","12252140"," They want to be right in here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12252140","12255140"," But as the end of the day comes into play right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12255140","12258140"," Maybe you sneak up there and print all that stuff to the upside right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12258140","12260140"," But not until they're there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12260140","12263140"," Worth a bunch less right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12263140","12270140"," You got to see that at home."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12271140","12276140"," So as as we get to that close the expectation for me at least."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12276140","12279140"," Is that we go up into here right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12279140","12285140"," All that ball that burn up in here and then I'll wait and see."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12285140","12292140"," For price if it ever gets up above here. So if you're if you're a trader right now, right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12292140","12295140"," If you're a trader right now, you can trade this up and down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12295140","12297140"," All you want."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12297140","12300140"," If you're an investor, you can't buy in here. Can you meet?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12300140","12303140"," You could buy with some trying to catch some theta."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12303140","12308140"," If you wanted to if you're a if you're a theta trader, this is awesome for you, right."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12308140","12313140"," So you can't get bullish for the next leg up unless we're up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12313140","12318140"," So for a bull for a trader to be like, hey, I want to trade that squeeze."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12318140","12323140"," You're looking for above the hourly trigger above four fifty four fifty."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12392140","12396140"," You need to see price come back down here and then lift up on Monday or something."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12396140","12401140"," You'd be a buyer on Monday possibly possibly be a buyer on open Monday,"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12401140","12403140"," but I would not be a buyer over the weekend."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12403140","12406140"," Like a bullish buyer over Friday to Monday or anything like that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12406140","12410140"," I don't want to see that failure over the weekend. Come back in on Monday and it's"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12410140","12412140"," like bloodbath to the death."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12430140","12434140"," So expectations into the weekend. You ready for it?"
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12435140","12440140"," Expectations in the weekend upside price target Friday and Monday."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12440140","12442140"," 45450."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12443140","12447140"," I would not be holding long at that number."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12447140","12452140"," I would be trying to sell that number 45450 trying to sell it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12452140","12454140"," If you're a seller."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12454140","12458140"," If you want to be a buyer at 45450."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12458140","12461140"," You have to be above 45450."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12462140","12467140"," And you have to hold 45450 with a back test."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12467140","12471140"," To initiate a long position."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12471140","12473140"," To trade."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12473140","12477140"," So I keep saying 454 my bad 434."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12492140","12495140"," You need to you need to break above this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12497140","12501140"," To initiate the trade higher to 442."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12501140","12505140"," I said 452 but it's 442 99 up here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12507140","12511140"," So until that happens range bound into next week."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12511140","12513140"," If that does not happen."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12514140","12517140"," I would expect range bound with the top."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12517140","12519140"," Of the hourly trigger."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12520140","12522140"," Down to that for 30."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12532140","12533140"," I got a typo in here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12541140","12542140"," There we go."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12543140","12550140"," We should be range bound next week between 43450 and 430."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12550140","12555140"," But a 40 point range in S&P next week."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12555140","12560140"," If there's a break below 430."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12560140","12563140"," If there's a break below 434."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12563140","12567140"," You will chase that up or down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12567140","12570140"," Dealers will both chase that up or down."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12570140","12572140"," If we break above 434."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12574140","12577140"," Dealers will chase that down side as well."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12588140","12590140"," Now I'm in these calls until the close."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12590140","12592140"," I'm in these calls in the close."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12593140","12596140"," We have to break this half hour trigger for me to lose it."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12596140","12597140"," So right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12598140","12599140"," Yeah, I'm good right now."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12599140","12600140"," I'm good."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12600140","12603140"," So I want to see a break of this right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12606140","12610140"," I am not a seller unless you break below this right here."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12617140","12618140"," Like anything like this."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12618140","12622140"," Any kind of breaking any of that stuff right there."

"SJKPE0jHdeo","12625140","12627140"," So we'll move this right over here again."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12627140","12629140"," I'll put it right there again."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12629140","12631140"," You'll see like a break below."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12631140","12633140"," And then that down move right there."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12633140","12636140"," But not a seller unless you break that."
"SJKPE0jHdeo","12636140","12638140"," Not a seller here."
