"220420","220700"," Good morning."
"221360","222480"," Starlight, Charles, three."
"222940","224380"," Morning to all of you out there this morning. "
"224540","224980"," How are you all doing today?"
"225000","226060"," Good morning, Dan, Travis."
"226760","227820"," Everybody's doing well today."
"230820","236820"," So yesterday, into the bell, some of you were here yesterday, we talked about maybe trading"
"236820","237240"," sideways. "
"238040","241320"," We talked about even possibility of trading sideways and slightly down."
"242660","246440"," But that traditional charts yesterday pointed towards a higher open today."
"247100","249700"," We knew that we had a lower or a higher low. "
"250140","251180"," We had a higher high."
"251580","259320"," The end of the day, we had a higher low from the previous day."
"260279","264200"," So we talked about how everything pointed towards everything being up today. "
"266700","270360"," We know if you follow Elliot wave that we're supposed to be down this morning, right?"
"270560","271820"," Three bar rule, three bars up."
"273020","275220"," We know that didn't work out this morning."
"276100","281140"," So again, we're back to, you know, you use those tools, but you don't rely upon some of them,"
"281240","281360"," right?"
"284200","288800"," But the one key about yesterday, the one important thing about yesterday with that I want to"
"288800","297240"," impress upon people is not just the traditional candlestick charts, but we talked yesterday about"
"297240","301520"," that there was one key point that I said to yesterday to remember today. "
"301940","307540"," And that was where the volatility line was, right?"
"307700","308560"," The volatility trigger."
"309420","315460"," And we talked about if we sell down into clothes yesterday, that's very negative and it's good for"
"315460","315740"," the bears."
"316880","321060"," And if we trade up into the clothes yesterday, it's not good for the bears. "
"321260","322020"," It's good for the bulls."
"322580","328460"," And if you watched futures last night, I'm sure some of you futures traders can remember that we"
"328460","330260"," spoke about a specific number."
"330500","332160"," We spoke about 4714. "
"333240","336680"," And we, I think we closed right near the pin on 4714."
"337320","339100"," But you even watched last night in futures."
"339700","342240"," We just kind of bounced right off that number at some point, right?"
"342600","346660"," Middle of the night, like 12, 1 o'clock in the morning, you saw us bouncing off that 4714. "
"347240","350420"," We did a dance off of the volatility trigger yesterday."
"351040","353740"," And this morning, you see, we bounced again this morning."
"354240","358020"," I think we bounced this morning off 4703 or something. "
"359520","362760"," And, you know, we're bouncing right off the top of that, that ball trigger."
"362900","368680"," So if we're staying above the ball trigger, if you're bullish, I'm bullish today."
"369520","379380"," And if we were if we had closed below 4714 or 470 and had woken up this morning"
"379380","381260"," with that, I would have been feeling the same thing. "
"382040","385580"," So I'm bullish this morning right off the bell just to give you guys a heads up."
"386020","387180"," You should be too."
"387880","389540"," We should go up this morning. "
"390060","396100"," There's nothing saying that we shouldn't go up today unless something else comes out as as the bell"
"396100","396720"," rings here."
"398320","400940"," So I'll take a look at the flow this morning as we get started."
"402420","404040"," And I'm I'm cash right now. "
"404100","407280"," If any of you guys are wondering, I didn't take a position in to close yesterday."
"407580","410100"," If you took a long into close yesterday, congratulations."
"411060","414380"," You know more than I know, which is a good thing, right?"
"414540","415840"," You guys are making money at this point. "
"416420","423540"," But I'm looking for us to do some some form of a retest this morning from the previous low from"
"423540","423720"," yesterday."
"423720","425440"," And then we're we should be heading up here."
"426040","432780"," I want to also also briefly talk about inflation and the numbers that came out this morning. "
"437690","442870"," I want to talk about how that does play in slightly into ER season."
"445060","446540"," Give me just a second here."
"448220","454320"," The claims numbers, the PPI number, which is an extension of the previous numbers from from a day"
"454320","454620"," ago. "
"458880","460380"," I want to talk about rates."
"461320","465360"," You know, there's there's the someone came out yesterday this morning and said we could have up to"
"465360","469600"," three or four even possibly four rate hikes in 2022."
"471040","477520"," And you know, when you really I was I was reading a paper yesterday that talked about where hedge"
"477520","481780"," funds and banks can put their money like with no risk, right?"
"482080","488960"," Where can these fund managers put their money with no risk and there really is no place they can"
"488960","489720"," put it anymore. "
"490380","494440"," So they have to take risk on in the stock market."
"495660","497580"," So what's the mix of what they're doing?"
"497860","500800"," They're not getting seven percent back from the bond market."
"501640","503560"," It's the biggest bear market ever in bonds. "
"504100","510560"," So even with all the huff and stuff and all the puff and puff, even if we're gonna bring the"
"510560","514240"," markets back here and there, we have a defined bottom for all intensive purposes."
"514760","519640"," We don't have rates that are in the 20 range, 15%, 25%."
"520100","528400"," Even if we have rates up to 3% to 6%, it still leaves room for for the markets to"
"528400","531060"," go up, you know, and for even for tech to go up. "
"532220","537980"," So other than technical pullbacks and probably a defined bottom at some point this spring or even"
"537980","543420"," if it happens in summer, I don't expect this this market to sell off unless we sell off heavy"
"543420","545200"," unless we have a tail risk event."
"545680","549920"," And we talked earlier this week about how to prepare for that tail risk event."
"550700","552820"," I want you to think about that as we move forward. "
"553320","559940"," If we do start to trade up to 475, 478, 480, I want you to think about putting on one"
"559940","561140"," of those hedges at some point."
"562440","564180"," We're not past that moment, right?"
"565220","572340"," That thought process that we had, I'm still looking to place that trade if we get up to that 478,"
"572760","573320"," 480 level."
"574280","578860"," I don't care if we trade to 500 or if we trade to 525, if I can get a nice"
"578860","587480"," hedge for this year and be looking to trade ER season and also find a bottom to buy stocks for"
"587480","593600"," 2022 between now and March, then the plan the plan stays, right?"
"594300","595640"," Situations normal right now. "
"597320","599660"," Situation is what we think it is, right?"
"599940","600420"," Nothing has changed."
"601360","606680"," Even if we trade sideways this year, we should find a nice bottom by March, even if let's say the"
"606680","610960"," spy only makes 3% this year or trades flat zero on the year."
"611340","617440"," Well, still, if we buy that perfect bottom on a turn and have those stocks available to purchase,"
"617440","618840"," then we're good to go. "
"619320","620580"," We have our tail risk covered."
"620920","622180"," We can take this market long."
"623780","630620"," So the levels that I gave you this morning, I don't ever include the cashback levels. "
"630940","632400"," So I'm going to give them to you here."
"633360","645360"," Your cashback levels for yesterday would be 470.15. And then also think about think about"
"645360","655780"," force, 470.15 and call it for 469.41. So"
"655780","660860"," if we get a nice little pullback this morning, we close the close the pump into close yesterday."
"661480","668080"," Pump into close was right around 470.15. So if we close that real quick, that buy program that went"
"668080","670760"," into the closing bell, then we can take off for the day here. "
"671960","675520"," If you're bearish this morning, you should you guys know you're right."
"675620","680280"," We talked about our someone brought up yesterday, the day before the three bar rule and that we"
"680280","682000"," should trade down the next five days."
"682600","688280"," We also know that we have OpEx coming up on the 21st. "
"688640","690820"," So some months we do tend to trade down."
"690820","693120"," Some months we do trade up for these for this next week."
"694020","698660"," But some months we do trade down straight into the Thursday before OpEx. "
"698880","701480"," So keep that keep keep open-minded that we could trade down."
"702880","707760"," And then we'll have like a ripper on Thursday and then we may be our flat on the 21st."
"707960","710000"," Like the 21st is Oak Monthly OpEx. "
"711040","713220"," The 20th would be that Thursday."
"714220","717920"," But we tended either trade up or down leading into that week."
"719380","721060"," So we'll see what the flow is this morning. "
"721220","722420"," We'll see what the equity flow is."
"722540","723620"," We'll check Tesla this morning."
"723780","726820"," I know a bunch of Tesla people are out there want to know what's going on. "
"727460","728700"," We'll take a look at the quick levels here."
"729380","735060"," And you got buyers already down below at 4.71.73. You've got buyers as well down below at 4 "
"735060","741360",".71.19. Let's see if there are any buyers even lower since any chance of a dip this morning."
"742520","742720"," Okay. "
"742800","748640"," Get some buyers at 4.70.20 4.69.61. This is roughly where I want to be seeing this"
"748640","749060"," right here."
"749120","752380"," You want us to be seeing these buyers stepping in to dip by."
"753840","755140"," We'll look at Tesla next. "
"756860","758440"," You guys, I'm going to look at IWM."
"759080","761080"," Any of the major indexes you want to take a look at."
"761100","762260"," The Qs for you real quick. "
"762280","763140"," I can do that as well."
"795910","803550"," We also want to show you that yesterday we had the buyers club down below at 10.80. It looks"
"803550","809570"," like the buyers club this morning on Tesla has moved up to 10.90. And that's a good sign."
"810130","817530"," We have more buyers as well as that 10.95. Looks like we've we've created that support at 10.99."
"817710","819410"," You don't want to give this up this morning on Tesla. "
"820070","824750"," We're going to look above and see what the price targets are if the if we've expanded that call"
"824750","826890"," wall at all on Tesla this morning."
"828290","834910"," We have some resistance above here at 11.20. We'll take a look above here and see what the ultimate"
"834910","835930"," price target is."
"839430","845630"," We also did find out that there is we have the earnings day right that came out this morning or"
"845630","846690"," come out last night maybe. "
"847230","848490"," I saw something on that."
"850990","854150"," And you can see the the target is 1,200."
"855610","858450"," So that's going to be my assumption that we're targeting 1,200. "
"858870","860670"," It's the same as it was yesterday."
"861550","868030"," If it would have changed this morning is the buyers have stepped up to this 10.90, 1,100 level"
"868030","868750"," let's call it."
"869470","877610"," If you can break through 11.18 this morning the target would for today would be 11.50. And your"
"877610","881430"," buyers have moved up down here 10.91. That's the by the dip for the by the dippers today. "
"889710","891410"," We'll take a quick look at IWM."
"891410","895210"," And then we're going to also look at the cues."
"896450","902500"," And then we'll get into some individual tickers. "
"907340","908600"," Come on now get my cues."
"914570","916070"," We'll check out the cues next."
"920480","923580"," We saw those airline calls coming yesterday towards the bell. "
"923740","928800"," We saw calls coming in for United Airlines, JetBlue, American Airlines, BA."
"929000","930940"," I think BA ripped this morning, right?"
"931540","935120"," We saw all these calls coming in yesterday towards the bell."
"935780","938560"," Looks like somebody knew more than we did yesterday, right?"
"941260","946360"," BA went from 216 to 225 at 6 o'clock this morning. "
"946360","947140"," It's outstanding."
"947720","951680"," There is a little bit of a pullback in BA this morning not to be unexpected."
"951880","956520"," People take like to take profit off companies like Disney and BA right at the bell. "
"957040","960080"," But we'll look to see if BA starts trading higher."
"960900","964660"," Some people were claiming that BA should be at 300 right now."
"964880","966460"," I'm not sure if that's true or not. "
"966780","969440"," We'll watch for BA to catch a bit again this morning."
"973330","975350"," Yeah, and I see some BA calls coming in."
"975530","982850"," So right off the bell there's calls on BA, Apple, Nvidia, MU, INTC. "
"983970","985890"," GS has some call structure coming in."
"986910","994770"," There's some nice calls, some algo-high-driven score calls on MQ, Mike, Qbert, right?"
"994930","1004670"," Our Quinn, Mike Quinn, MQ, 17.5C, January 21st, 15, excuse me, 17 "
"1004670","1012360",".5 calls, seeing more call structure on AMD."
"1016700","1017980"," Apple's got a lot of calls. "
"1018460","1019140"," Amazon's got calls."
"1019420","1020880"," Looks like the queues might be going up today."
"1021620","1022820"," Amazon's got more calls. "
"1022840","1029700"," January 14th, 33 or excuse me, 3335C to quarter million dollars on that."
"1029940","1039900"," PTON has a bid this morning, January 21st, 38C, BAC, and BA of course has calls"
"1039900","1040420"," this morning."
"1040560","1041859"," I'm going to keep my eyes on BA today. "
"1042460","1043480"," We'll take a look at that tick."
"1043660","1047960"," That'll be the first ticker that we look at after we check on the queues and IWM."
"1053640","1056020"," QCom has a crazy bid this morning, right?"
"1056640","1060280"," We talked about QCom that they have a, we'll check QCom as well. "
"1061700","1064500"," So I remember the QCom I think had a ceiling at 190."
"1066400","1067980"," So we'll check QCom, BA."
"1071180","1074000"," I know that some of you are long in QCom out there. "
"1074500","1075520"," They've had a great morning."
"1078900","1080400"," CVLT had a great morning."
"1081940","1083500"," I think Joe was in that trade. "
"1085660","1089160"," Jets is up 1.63% off the bell."
"1089860","1091540"," Outstanding morning if you're in airlines."
"1092680","1094180"," AMD's up 2%. "
"1094180","1100480"," PayPal's up 1.6%. And there we go."
"1100600","1102360"," The queue's back up to 390, right?"
"1102560","1103480"," Buy the 380 dip."
"1104380","1105140"," Trade it to 390. "
"1108360","1110080"," This actually looks pretty nice here."
"1110200","1114980"," You can see that the target right now, the ultimate target is 400 on the queues, right?"
"1115120","1115660"," That's what you want."
"1125040","1131440"," And if you're lucky today, you'll catch a dip to 385 on the queues this morning. "
"1132340","1134280"," We're going to skip IWM for a minute."
"1134380","1135760"," We're going to look at BA real quick."
"1136340","1137920"," CFBA actually catches a bit. "
"1138020","1139200"," We'll check out QCom too."
"1140040","1141640"," So no some of you guys are in QCom."
"1148260","1152680"," We'll see if it's going to rip higher and break through that 190 number. "
"1157670","1164410"," Also this morning, you can see that the first resistance on the spy has moved up."
"1164410","1170570"," Remember that we had all those sellers down below at 4.73. It's now moved up to 4.74.88"
"1170570","1171510"," this morning."
"1172190","1175350"," So that's the price target as of right now for the spy. "
"1198000","1200340"," Let's see if we can break through anything on."
"1201580","1204660"," Looks like we had sellers step right in at the bell on BA."
"1210960","1213300"," Boy, if you could break this 230 up here. "
"1213940","1217420"," So I'll give you some numbers to be looking for here if you're going to trade BA today."
"1219980","1225400"," You've got slightly more sellers but the options buyers are stepping in."
"1226200","1228940"," This looks more like just profit taking. "
"1229640","1240420"," 224.53. 226.78. 229.46. If you're able to be able to break above this, you"
"1240420","1242120"," know that we can see BA do these things."
"1244640","1247680"," They wind up just cranking."
"1248460","1250580"," 250 is the price target. "
"1250800","1275660"," 248.89. We'll"
"1275660","1279020"," check on Q-com and see what Q-com has to say for itself."
"1279660","1283880"," If you guys remember the wall above Q-com was 191 I think."
"1286020","1288340"," Let that load up here and see if we can get higher. "
"1292680","1293660"," Yeah, JetBlue."
"1293860","1296080"," We talked about JetBlue calls yesterday at the bell."
"1296420","1298740"," I think the last 10 minutes of yesterday's broadcast. "
"1299520","1301340"," We talked about the calls that came in."
"1301360","1302460"," It just pinged $15."
"1306760","1309360"," Q-com just bashing in this morning. "
"1310640","1312760"," Meeting up with sellers up here."
"1315080","1317840"," Might be the time to take some profit off the table."
"1318760","1324280"," Let the take some profit here maybe off Q-com. "
"1325320","1335300"," You've got some resistance at 192.69. More resistance at 194.49. I guess if you"
"1335300","1342360"," could pick it back up at 195 and run it up to 199 on Q-com."
"1350410","1355190"," We'll look at IWM next and then I'll take some ticker requests from you this morning."
"1355650","1360090"," If you guys have plays that you're getting into for the day let me know and I will take a"
"1360090","1360270"," look. "
"1360510","1367250"," Well, why don't you guys post what you're interested in trading today and I will search to see"
"1367250","1372230"," where all the money flow is while you post in the chat box what you're playing today."
"1373830","1384150"," What you're interested in playing what you're in for the day and"
"1384150","1385470"," I'll see where the money flow is going."
"1410250","1414570"," Let me go back and take a look at what you guys have posted here so far. "
"1417690","1419170"," Yeah, I've got the Hero Indicator."
"1420170","1427490"," I will check to see I think maybe I reset this morning so I'll make sure I turn the Hero"
"1427490","1431510"," Indicator off on anything that it was turned off on."
"1432810","1435150"," I'll make sure it's on here as well. "
"1438310","1446090"," If I didn't reload this morning I did reload my previous work set but it still didn't load this"
"1446090","1446390"," morning."
"1459940","1461720"," So there's the Hero Indicator."
"1467070","1469570"," The R2 is blank for ES. "
"1470810","1475370"," Let me give you the number on R2 and ES for support and resistance."
"1488730","1498370"," So R2 on support and resistance for ES is 4.7. Well, so the pivot point is 4.716.92."
"1498830","1508410"," The last price at the close yesterday was 4.731.25. Resistance 1 is 4.738 "
"1508410","1517410",".83. Next one R2 is 4.761.42. R3 is 4.783 "
"1517410","1523240",".33. I'll give those one more time."
"1524020","1532460"," The pivot is 4.716.92. Yesterday's close was 4.731.25. So you can just disregard that one. "
"1533260","1543040"," R1, 4.738.83. R2, 4.761. 0.42. R3 is 4.783.33."
"1543580","1545240"," That's on the ES Mini for today."
"1545680","1547300"," I had some formatting issues this morning."
"1550100","1550840"," It's weird. "
"1550940","1552840"," I'm getting these artifacts on the Google Sheets."
"1553700","1555220"," It's not following the formatting."
"1555580","1559180"," I think I might have to scrub it every day and then re-upload every day. "
"1573280","1573960"," Good morning, Robert."
"1577320","1587120"," Price target on IWM is 220.29. And I'll be looking at"
"1587120","1588460"," tickers here in just a moment."
"1590920","1591560"," Tesla. "
"1593800","1596460"," Chase Winter says he thinks we're going down."
"1599580","1601200"," QQQ rejected again."
"1602680","1603340"," Good morning, Marie. "
"1604200","1605520"," Good morning, Ritesh."
"1605520","1605820"," Britesh."
"1607180","1608220"," Hey, good morning, Brad. "
"1608440","1608920"," How are you, brother?"
"1609620","1613520"," I was trying to find you yesterday to talk to you and show you those charts, which we tried to"
"1613520","1615520"," watch Tesla right in the clothes for you, bro."
"1617380","1623020"," Mihai is looking myself to close the future longs from yesterday before Brainard testifies."
"1624240","1625780"," Be careful with Brainard. "
"1626000","1628660"," She, I don't know."
"1629100","1630400"," I guess Mihai has a good point."
"1630820","1634580"," There is one thing to say about Brainard, right?"
"1634900","1636120"," You guys should probably know. "
"1641580","1644580"," You, there's a few things, some ideas to understand."
"1644680","1652520"," If you look back to if you study the Fed shares in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, you know, no"
"1652520","1658020"," one would want the Fed Chair job if they were trashed when they first come in."
"1658480","1662380"," No one wants to get trashed as the Fed Chair as they're leaving. "
"1663920","1667580"," You saw Jerome Powell treated well this week."
"1670080","1675580"," And we know, we kind of think that the word on the street at least is that Brainard will be"
"1675580","1678400"," the replacement for Jerome Powell."
"1679640","1685300"," And the question then becomes, does Brainard become the hatchet man or hatchet woman?"
"1685560","1685960"," Doesn't matter. "
"1686620","1688540"," Hatchet woman for the Fed, right?"
"1689780","1694340"," And they usually will bring in a hatchet person to, to raise rates."
"1694400","1703140"," But even if she is the hatchet person, you know, the rates are only, we're not looking at 15%"
"1703140","1703480"," rates."
"1703480","1708780"," We're not looking at 20, 30% rates at this time. "
"1709020","1717860"," So I don't think that they're going to talk to her today and get real nasty."
"1718580","1725820"," Unless, and if they do, then my thought process would be that maybe she isn't the next Fed Chair,"
"1726600","1726880"," right?"
"1727000","1731540"," She's just going to be there to take a driving, which is possible as well."
"1733920","1739140"," So I'm not overly concerned with, with her today, with her appointment. "
"1744240","1749580"," DAL earnings this morning, TSM earnings blow out this morning, moving all the chips."
"1752900","1755760"," But TAS is asking if anybody's liking Roku today."
"1757400","1760240"," Eric says, cap is never really bearish. "
"1760240","1761060"," It's just a mask."
"1763640","1765620"," Rusty is leading this morning."
"1769510","1771370"," Didn't trim your XLF exposure yet. "
"1771450","1772490"," So yeah, I like XLF."
"1772750","1777470"," I think XLF is a very safe play especially if you're in like a three month call."
"1780670","1782450"," I'm long in short in Qcom. "
"1784070","1785090"," Yeah, I've got a discord."
"1785870","1786850"," I haven't launched it yet."
"1786930","1788450"," I just haven't, it's almost done. "
"1788770","1790690"," I haven't spent any time in the past."
"1791270","1792570"," I built it last weekend."
"1792790","1794690"," I haven't had any time this week to work on it. "
"1795230","1796050"," But I'm getting close."
"1796870","1801610"," What I think I'm going to do today is I think I'm going to sign, I'm going to leave the"
"1801610","1802730"," live stream up this morning."
"1803710","1810210"," I'm going to sign off from video and voice and I'm going to work on sifting through the DMs for"
"1810210","1811690"," help on the discord. "
"1812610","1814330"," I'm going to work on the discord today."
"1814850","1820810"," I'm going to talk to Joe Donut about the website if he's available today and see if we can get"
"1820810","1822710"," this launched before the weekend comes."
"1830040","1834320"," Yeah, buyers are stepping in on Tesla or they were at the bell. "
"1835240","1838440"," You can see we are coiling on spy."
"1840500","1844560"," Semi's are re-pumping because TSM is beating."
"1845100","1847480"," Yeah, I'll do Roku next for you to Matthias. "
"1849240","1851660"," You guys have asked twice now on Roku."
"1853300","1853740"," Done."
"1884860","1887680"," Yeah, I'll take a look at Tesla again for you. "
"1890400","1892160"," Ben makes a very good point this morning."
"1892700","1896060"," When they pin spy in QQQ, IWM can fly."
"1896400","1897140"," I agree with that. "
"1897600","1899400"," Hutch is going to wait it out for a little bit."
"1900140","1903140"," Someone's asking about zoom beyond."
"1903940","1904940"," Yeah, it's really weird. "
"1905100","1905800"," There was a ton."
"1906460","1915980"," So I was flooded yesterday with YouTube videos about the beyond meat KFC deal once again."
"1916720","1918860"," I think that they actually launched that stuff. "
"1922340","1929620"," Yeah, Sean, if you want to help with the discord, can you give me a shout on at Captain's Alpha"
"1929620","1932440"," and a DM and just say, I'm interested in getting involved."
"1933100","1936720"," I look at beyond next."
"1939760","1942900"," Any help would be appreciated, especially if you have discord experience. "
"1948950","1951350"," So Roku, let's take a look at Roku."
"1953950","1958710"," Roku has more buyers than sellers, slightly negative hero indicator."
"1959830","1961310"," It's kind of right in the middle, right?"
"1962230","1963830"," You see the buyers down below 170. "
"1964350","1966470"," You see the sellers above at 178."
"1968910","1973990"," I'd be interested to take a long 151."
"1975350","1978430"," That'd be a nice breakout moment for Roku. "
"1982310","1988870"," Set a buy at 170 on Roku."
"1989590","1994010"," Some slight negative hero on it, but it's not overly terrible."
"1994290","1995850"," You've got lots of buyers stepping in here. "
"1997390","1999590"," You do want to see a break above 180."
"1999990","2004930"," If you do see a break above this 180, let's say be a buyer down below at 170.32 or"
"2004930","2005750"," maybe slightly higher."
"2006270","2008850"," You've got some nice ice down below here to 172. "
"2010750","2020710"," And then sell your position at 179.42. Look"
"2020710","2021530"," at beyond next."
"2023550","2026410"," Yeah, a whole ton of, ton of YouTube stuff coming my feed."
"2027210","2032070"," Everybody's reviewing the new beyond chicken nuggets. "
"2032890","2034350"," Is that what you call them chicken nuggets?"
"2036050","2037250"," I'll do misfit next."
"2037570","2038990"," Someone saying they're trading misfit today."
"2039730","2040370"," Amazon today. "
"2044690","2047030"," Yeah, I think we see a slow grind up to 475."
"2047909","2050190"," It's a nice day to be putting on some spreads."
"2051030","2060510"," And we talked yesterday about putting on some condors or some butterflies at the bell. "
"2060610","2063790"," You could could have done it like a broken wing yesterday at the bell."
"2064170","2066370"," And then today at the bell, you make it a full butterfly."
"2073880","2074940"," And there goes spy. "
"2075199","2078719"," It's heading up towards 475, like a fly to a light."
"2085690","2086909"," Beyond's got blue skies."
"2087790","2089050"," What do you say about that?"
"2092330","2094949"," All the buyers are down below at 55 bucks. "
"2095570","2096890"," All kinds of support."
"2097630","2100130"," It's running into some resistance here at 75."
"2102750","2104670"," Looks like price targets a hundred bucks. "
"2106510","2113510"," And by the dip at 63.92, 60.32. Any kind of bad news by 51 bucks."
"2121830","2123130"," We'll look at MSFT."
"2124850","2126750"," For all those dividend bros out there. "
"2135440","2138140"," If I can get a buy on the spy, I'm probably going to buy."
"2143540","2144560"," Let's take a look."
"2158240","2160220"," Let me take a look at my, I'm going to make a trade here. "
"2176670","2186570"," We have a golden ticket coming in on exp June 17th, 190 C for 1.2"
"2186570","2187710"," million dollars."
"2189880","2192240"," Algo driven trades coming out."
"2192820","2199720"," EDC April 14th, 75 C, $700,000 on that trade. "
"2200780","2202980"," EDC, Echo Delta, Charlie."
"2204000","2208700"," BB, BY has some algo driven calls coming out on it."
"2209160","2211520"," February 11th, 17 C."
"2214400","2216300"," AMC has some calls on it. "
"2216500","2219360"," 25 C expiring January 14th."
"2220360","2222020"," That's got it at high algo score."
"2226850","2229330"," BA with lots of calls still coming in on it. "
"2229410","2230950"," We're going to look at the best calls this morning."
"2231690","2235910"," And right up the gate, Tesla has all the money flow with it."
"2236710","2243110"," It has January 14th, 1150 C for $138,000. "
"2244010","2250810"," But this is where someone was just mentioning the call while moving on Tesla and support for"
"2250810","2252150"," resistance disappearing."
"2252650","2254090"," This is why this is disappearing."
"2254610","2262150"," We have a call for February 18th, 1200 C, $1.6 million on Tesla. "
"2262850","2264590"," So we'll look at Tesla this morning."
"2265510","2267610"," And we'll see if it's shaping up."
"2268030","2272890"," You really do want to be seeing call expansion on Tesla. "
"2272890","2274310"," And that's what we're seeing this morning."
"2275950","2281930"," Looks like we're targeting ER plays got a bounce here at 318 on MSFT."
"2282470","2284310"," This might be a nice dip by. "
"2284950","2289710"," We'll add the we'll add the hero indicator to it."
"2292270","2294410"," And see what it's showing you all."
"2294570","2298530"," So you've got more sellers than buyers on on Microsoft. "
"2300870","2302890"," You might be looking to dip by 315."
"2304730","2307270"," Keep an eye on MSFIT because this could be a good trade."
"2308050","2311990"," If we trade down and bounce off 315 down here, it might make for a very nice long. "
"2314830","2316130"," I like this trade a lot."
"2316570","2319510"," Pay attention here where it's bouncing right now."
"2319930","2326230"," If there's a break below 317 88, and it starts to fall down to 315, this might make a great"
"2326230","2326570"," trade. "
"2332590","2337910"," So your next big your next golden ticket is eXPA PE, which we already talked about."
"2338150","2341270"," We've got tons of orders coming in on BA this morning."
"2342010","2344790"," We also have a lot of orders coming in on BAC. "
"2345710","2350330"," So your BA calls are January 21st, 225 C."
"2351570","2356930"," BAC your calls are January 14th, 49.5 C."
"2360190","2365450"," And you got a big boy stepping in for June 17th, 48 C."
"2366870","2372110"," Then you've got people stepping in on BAC, 55 C for October 21st."
"2372850","2375070"," So I'm very positive on BAC this morning."
"2376490","2380170"," EDC, you've got April 14th, 75 C."
"2381530","2391290"," Lots of calls on Apple all focused around January 21st, January 14th, roughly 177.5 C and 180"
"2391290","2391790"," C."
"2392990","2396010"," Amazon has some decent call flow on it this morning as well. "
"2396910","2398750"," Wells Fargo has some call flow on it."
"2399650","2401090"," MU has call flow."
"2401230","2403430"," Ford has a rack of calls on it. "
"2404050","2412130"," All retail driven, January 14th and January 21st, at 25 C and 26 C respectively."
"2412890","2420150"," INTC has some call flow on it this morning, January 28th, and March 18th, 55 and 60 C."
"2429910","2433370"," Yeah, and I'm seeing even more BAC flow come in right now."
"2433370","2439890"," Watch out on Roku, there's some, there's some flow, some negative put flow coming in on Roku right"
"2439890","2440170"," now. "
"2441270","2446170"," January 14th, 170 C or 170 P, be aware of that."
"2455720","2462260"," And today being Thursday, I bet you can have a really nice, really nice butterfly on the spy for"
"2462260","2464540"," closing on Friday."
"2467720","2471220"," So I'm going to be looking here on the spy and seeing if I can grab something. "
"2478970","2487390"," Think about where the, let's see where, let's take a look at where the, where all the money is for"
"2487390","2488130"," Friday Opics."
"2498430","2502050"," I have a bunch of calls for 472C expiring Friday."
"2503150","2503570"," That's reasonable. "
"2507800","2512300"," 30,000 calls on 472C."
"2512520","2513860"," They're $1.83 right now."
"2514640","2515420"," It's a little pricey. "
"2516840","2522700"," I might take a spread here or I'm going to look at a neutral trade here."
"2528300","2531960"," Probably should have, probably should have bought these right on the bell this morning."
"2552140","2554780"," 475, 468. "
"2557960","2567750"," Do I think we trade higher than"
"2567750","2571650"," 475 or 460 or lower than 469."
"2573130","2579750"," The riskier trade is the iron butterfly costs $133, pays $267."
"2581350","2585330"," The safer bet is the iron condor costs $60, pays $40. "
"2596740","2602040"," I have a feeling that we close at like 468, 469 Friday."
"2603180","2604760"," Maybe we rip up into the close."
"2606780","2609820"," But it sure as shit looks like we were moved here, doesn't it?"
"2609820","2619560"," It looks like we're moved down here to this, this zone, this 460, 466"
"2619560","2624800"," to 470 area, like the market, but like the banks want it right around here. "
"2642040","2651400"," More TSM calls coming in January 14th, 145C, seeing a mixed bag and Nvidia this morning."
"2654020","2656140"," Yeah, Starlight saying likely a boring day."
"2656280","2657540"," I think it's going to be boring as well. "
"2657540","2659980"," I think you put on like an in the money call spread."
"2660560","2664480"," Slightly, you could do a call spread that's like 465, 468."
"2668870","2670530"," Yeah, I'll check LCID for you. "
"2670650","2672530"," I missed some, I missed some stuff here."
"2673130","2675830"," You don't need to go so high in your call spreads for a day like today."
"2676890","2679270"," You just, but you make them in the money or slightly even more in the money. "
"2684540","2686900"," Yeah, Chris is going to spend the day coding."
"2689020","2690640"," PayPal has been an awesome day trade."
"2690880","2691940"," We'll look at a bunch of stuff. "
"2692980","2696000"," I'm going to spend some time blowing through me, get back to the top here."
"2697180","2699320"," You guys are throwing out a ton of tickers at me."
"2702080","2704220"," So Paul, we'll look at MT real quick. "
"2704840","2706040"," How did X do this morning?"
"2706240","2707900"," There's a lot of calls on X yesterday."
"2711060","2713060"," At the belly yesterday in U.S. Steel."
"2713780","2715880"," It did all right off the belt, went to 26 bucks. "
"2716720","2718180"," Looks like it's selling off right now."
"2721660","2722640"," Everybody's day trading."
"2724080","2727020"," Nobody's holding positions for longer than a day, are they?"
"2733880","2736020"," Yeah, I don't see any weakness in the spy today. "
"2737120","2739120"," If I had to guess they're going to park it on Friday."
"2745560","2746500"," I mean, look at MT."
"2748880","2750340"," More sellers than buyers. "
"2752140","2759440"," Looks like it's a stock that where the buyers are in control or the sellers are in control."
"2762500","2767460"," You kind of have to watch it and just wait for the buyers to step in."
"2767560","2769460"," There's no real top or bottom. "
"2769600","2771020"," It looks like the seller's above at 38."
"2772860","2774700"," I would trade this on the VWAP."
"2775160","2779740"," If you're going to trade MT, just set up a VWAP and trade it like that. "
"2783760","2786060"," That's going to use classic trading."
"2787780","2788620"," We did MT."
"2793450","2794310"," All right, Winky. "
"2794490","2795570"," We'll take a look at ME next."
"2815280","2816820"," Ooh, I like that ME trade."
"2819440","2819920"," Winky. "
"2820320","2823960"," I like that."
"2824080","2825340"," I like that trade, Winky."
"2826200","2827980"," I like that ME trade, brother. "
"2830840","2832220"," Winky knows what he's doing."
"2832220","2832860"," Look at this."
"2834600","2835520"," Okay, so ready?"
"2835980","2837300"," Here's a trade setup for you guys. "
"2838240","2839780"," This is courtesy of Winky."
"2842680","2844440"," You've got support this morning."
"2844600","2850040"," This is really cool shit too because you can't tell, but you can't tell about this stuff unless"
"2850040","2851020"," you've got this book map. "
"2852240","2856200"," You got more sellers this morning on ME, right?"
"2857860","2859200"," You got more sellers."
"2859460","2863260"," You got selling pressure on ME."
"2886240","2890500"," Their earnings date is February 9th, right?"
"2890800","2893900"," So we've got ME earnings date, February 9th. "
"2895220","2901100"," They've been trading down forever, right?"
"2901920","2903260"," I'm going to be trading down since."
"2904500","2906200"," They've been trading down since a high."
"2906320","2907860"," They've had $18 as a high. "
"2908440","2911240"," They're down to 563 right now."
"2912240","2918780"," They've looked like they've got buyers at 551 and 530."
"2920620","2923360"," We'll take a look at the options chain for ME. "
"2923700","2924720"," I like this trade, Winky."
"2925200","2925920"," This is a good trade, brother."
"2926560","2928120"," Even just buying it. "
"2929880","2934940"," I typed in Winky instead of ME into my options chain."
"2943960","2946620"," Let's see where the sellers are on this too above."
"2951440","2957180"," We had support at $5, 533, bouncing on support right now. "
"2957260","2958480"," We have more sellers than ME."
"2959240","2962760"," Maybe they want to see $5, but then you've got sellers above at $680."
"2971320","2971760"," $680. "
"2988140","2989200"," When's their earnings date?"
"2989720","2991020"," February 9th."
"2995300","2999800"," Okay, you know what I would do is I would take some April 14th."
"3002420","3005440"," Or you know what I would do maybe to February 18th?"
"3007020","3008640"," I like February 18th. "
"3009440","3011020"," Let me see if there's any call spreads on this."
"3012340","3018590"," M E."
"3021230","3022830"," One month, bullish."
"3025850","3027290"," February 18th. "
"3027690","3028550"," Generate trades."
"3035410","3036790"," Oh wow, that's juicy."
"3037950","3038790"," That's really juicy. "
"3048100","3050600"," That's gonna be a tough one to beat, isn't it?"
"3054270","3055110"," That's why."
"3055470","3055710"," Okay."
"3057750","3061230"," This is a risky trade, but it could pay very well. "
"3065810","3066850"," February 18th."
"3066850","3069430"," Six, 7.5 call spreads."
"3070490","3073570"," They're 22 bucks and the risk is the risk is $22. "
"3074550","3076230"," It pays $128."
"3077270","3079350"," I don't think we get above $750."
"3082170","3090930"," I can see why it doesn't really pay, but the the wall on the wall on M E is $950,"
"3091230","3091830"," $959. "
"3092770","3095890"," Looks like there's sellers though at $7 bucks."
"3097810","3099530"," Best trades probably just buying stock."
"3101030","3109700"," I said an alert at $5.30 even right now. "
"3110840","3113180"," You could scale into stock between $5.60 and $5."
"3114840","3116400"," That's probably the safest trade."
"3117360","3120180"," Next safest trade, it doesn't really pay on spreads. "
"3122320","3125160"," I would say take the next expiry after."
"3126920","3131980"," I like the idea of taking the April 14th."
"3136710","3138990"," Take April 14th, 9c. "
"3139690","3143030"," They're only 25 cents, between 25 and 35 cents."
"3144030","3145970"," And there's some interest at that strike as well."
"3146910","3149850"," Put it up, put a bid in for $0.28 and see if they fail. "
"3152210","3156310"," 9c, expiring April 14th, sell them after ER."
"3156310","3164110"," If let's say they kill the February 18th or 18th, let's say they kill the February 18th contracts,"
"3164590","3166530"," they would print the April contracts."
"3167270","3171550"," They'd print them in February as soon as they murdered the February 18th contracts. "
"3172770","3174130"," I like that trade on M E."
"3179620","3180460"," That's a good one."
"3204000","3209300"," We'll go back to Tesla, see some Tesla, some Tesla puts coming in here."
"3221580","3223000"," All right, what are you on next?"
"3223840","3227340"," TSM, I'll show TSM, then ENPH. "
"3231660","3232400"," Thanks, Mihai."
"3233800","3236300"," I'm going to look at my DMs this morning at some point."
"3238080","3239240"," NVIDIA is not getting loved. "
"3239840","3240480"," Good morning, Cody."
"3242240","3243660"," Apple, I'll do Apple as well."
"3244000","3253960"," Let me just look at Tesla real quick, and then we'll get to BBBY more calls"
"3253960","3254540"," coming in. "
"3256240","3259960"," WFC more calls coming in, lots of calls on WFC."
"3261100","3262580"," Is XLF running this morning?"
"3268740","3274560"," You're going to be watching Tesla right now for a bounce off 10.90. And that DIPBY."
"3275580","3277900"," We'll see if we get that DIPBY down here. "
"3278720","3288720"," It's probably what I'm looking for right now is you got more support at 10.80. I'm"
"3288720","3290460"," going to be taking a trade here in just a second."
"3299330","3302250"," Let's see if Tesla finds support here."
"3302930","3311790"," We'll put the connection or settings, add-ons, hero, indicator, indicator, close. "
"3322820","3324700"," All right, give me my cashback, baby."
"3325100","3330660"," So any of you guys watching this right now that are wondering if the market is crashing right now,"
"3331180","3332320"," it doesn't look like it to me."
"3332580","3333780"," It just looks like a cashback. "
"3334400","3337000"," This is a cash gap close from the day before to me."
"3338840","3339900"," No, no, no."
"3341400","3342300"," No, there's no. "
"3343880","3345180"," No, there's no, no, no."
"3345820","3347020"," We're not doing that this morning."
"3348660","3351280"," We're not fixing my Microsoft account this morning, no. "
"3351820","3356340"," We're not fixing anything this morning."
"3357060","3362480"," You are about crashing through 10.80. You do still have support here at 10.80. And you've got that"
"3362480","3365120"," old school major support at 10.50 down below here."
"3365720","3367400"," But I think this is a cash gap close. "
"3367500","3373980"," I'm going to grab some calls here, either here or down below at 4.68.94. But I think I'm"
"3373980","3374740"," going to buy."
"3374920","3376400"," So I'm going to start entering a trade right now."
"3403030","3419420"," I like"
"3419420","3425750"," that 4.68. I might do a credit spread instead. "
"3447230","3449410"," More Tesla's jumping in right now."
"3449850","3451510"," I've got some more calls coming in."
"3452450","3459050"," NVIDIA is getting some calls January 14th, 275C, January 21st, 285C. "
"3459850","3461310"," The big boy just came in though."
"3461570","3464610"," February 18th, 26C on Ford."
"3465730","3469450"," February 18th, 26C, it's $1.1 million. "
"3470690","3477310"," Tesla calls just came in January 14th, $326,000, 1110C."
"3478110","3487830"," Nikola, and I shouldn't even be saying this, NKLA, January 21, 12C, and January 21, 12.5C."
"3490410","3491550"," I don't like to support."
"3492290","3496870"," I don't like to support Nikola at all. "
"3498490","3499250"," Spy."
"3499250","3499590"," I"
"3504100","3513980"," just"
"3513980","3518120"," saw some XLF puts coming in February 4th, 41P."
"3574500","3584450"," So I grabbed some Friday, 475Cs for Spy,"
"3584990","3587570"," January 14th, expiry, 475C. "
"3590460","3592120"," And I'll put a tight stop on it."
"3592200","3594000"," If we start to sell off, I'll get rid of them."
"3597760","3600320"," So I bought the dip if you guys want to know on the Spy. "
"3601860","3604680"," Looks like there was a nice dip buy down here on Tesla."
"3607920","3611700"," They cost me $0.48 on those Spy calls."
"3613320","3620620"," So there's my price target on the Spy right here, 475.16. We've got Hero Indicator blasting off"
"3620620","3620840"," here. "
"3620840","3625400"," Buyer's consuming sellers here on the cash back close."
"3626060","3627140"," We might still go down."
"3627220","3634420"," We could possibly go down to 469, 74. "
"3635360","3639100"," We go down as far as 469, flat or somewhere in there."
"3639980","3644020"," So if we keep trading down, I'll just keep averaging, dollar cost averaging in between now and"
"3644020","3644680"," Friday close."
"3647400","3653000"," So just if you guys want to know if I have a position, I've got January 14th, 475C. "
"3653660","3656420"," I'm not sure if we get there, but I don't."
"3656540","3661420"," I think we're going to be range bound here into Friday, but if I can hold on to make quick"
"3661420","3662140"," profit, I will."
"3664020","3669220"," And I like the idea of a pullback on the Spy and then a run up. "
"3669640","3671680"," And I like seeing this 475 here."
"3672040","3676940"," If you want to be a little bit safer, you could take month out or two week out, 475Cs."
"3677720","3679060"," We might print this on Monday. "
"3680040","3683940"," Might print it next Thursday, but I like the idea of this up here."
"3684080","3686260"," I like the idea that we have more buyers and sellers."
"3686780","3689380"," I like the idea that the heroine decators off the charts here. "
"3696050","3704810"," I am seeing some TQQ puts coming in, seeing January 14th, 76.25"
"3704810","3714810"," puts, three, four, $500,000, some QQQ puts on April 14th, 360P for"
"3714810","3715810"," $600,000."
"3716490","3719170"," So I think Chase was getting a little bearish earlier."
"3719990","3724370"," So if you think we're going to keep trading down, if you think the queues are going to sell off"
"3724370","3727570"," right now, there is some negative flow coming in for the queues. "
"3727790","3728250"," Yep, I'm down."
"3728490","3732250"," So I just triggered a sell on my calls."
"3732490","3733630"," They just sold off. "
"3736670","3739650"," That was like a call and I held for like five minutes."
"3741430","3743530"," And they triggered at 45 cents."
"3746990","3749590"," Maybe we drift down even more. "
"3750570","3761210"," If you guys are bearish, there's three sets of TQQ puts that came out, January 14th, 76.25. It"
"3761210","3768610"," was roughly a half million dollars split between, it was a sweep, excuse me, two sweeps in a block"
"3768610","3774950"," trade, XBI puts, 99 puts for January 14th."
"3783420","3788500"," And I got, I think I got tricked out of my calls here, kind of laughing my ass off here"
"3788500","3792700"," that I was, that I got the, I got the fishing expedition on my calls."
"3809870","3811390"," We'll take a look back at Tesla. "
"3817710","3819490"," The Tesla's got a nice bounce here."
"3836660","3837480"," Just grind."
"3837760","3839060"," That looks like they're grinding options. "
"3839860","3844740"," I got nailed, I got taken out of my calls at, I bought them at 48 cents and I triggered"
"3844740","3846680"," a sell at 45 cents on them."
"3847040","3848500"," So I got knocked out real fast."
"3853240","3858900"," I'm going to, I'm going to post these TQQ puts out there for you guys on Twitter real quick so"
"3858900","3863120"," you guys can see these because they're pretty, they're becoming significant at this point. "
"3866510","3868670"," Even if it's just intraday stuff."
"3868670","3871550"," I want to show you guys these."
"3871890","3876230"," This looks like somebody's doing something underneath the scenes, beneath the surface. "
"3877730","3880070"," So I'll post these on Twitter right now for you."
"3881630","3883990"," If you want to get bearish, you might be able to."
"3911660","3921640"," Keep your eyes, someone was mentioning here, it was Walter Bloomberg says that he has RSX on"
"3921640","3924780"," watch, ticker symbol, RSX. "
"3924980","3925880"," It's a Russian ETF."
"3927140","3929500"," They just bounced at 25 bucks."
"3932700","3938020"," They've been selling off since February, January of 2021. "
"3943240","3949320"," And there it looks like it might sell, let me bring it up right in real quick, RSX."
"3957220","3960060"," Walter Bloomberg is pumping RSX."
"3963520","3967960"," If I look for some news on this and see why he's got this on watch. "
"3981270","3993430"," The Van Eck Russia ETF, emerging market."
"3997870","4001270"," I don't know why it's on watch, but he's putting it on watch right now."
"4001970","4004510"," It's tagged, it's very low on its chart. "
"4007190","4009850"," So we'll look at RSX and see why he's bringing it up."
"4016350","4018070"," Still more sellers than buyers."
"4019850","4021490"," Let's see if there's a bottom to this thing. "
"4030070","4035970"," Yeah, it looks like there are some buyers down below here at $24.54. I don't know if I'd trade"
"4035970","4037170"," options on this one."
"4043420","4045060"," Let's take a look at RSX."
"4059930","4069730"," There's some interest on RSX on the February 4th, 26.5 Cs, but it has lots of puts"
"4069730","4070190"," on it. "
"4071050","4072430"," It's pretty well pinned."
"4072970","4077830"," If you're going to trade that ticker, that Walter Bloomberg published this morning, you might just"
"4077830","4083530"," want to buy shares if you're interested in it."
"4109840","4111260"," And they've even heard of that ETF. "
"4116560","4119680"," Emmy is still trading down there at $5.52 now."
"4120060","4124080"," I think the number we gave was $5.32 to look to buy Emmy."
"4125180","4137960"," $5 flat and $5.32. Tesla's"
"4137960","4138920"," just bouncing around. "
"4140160","4142779"," Yeah, thank God I sold it to that spy call, huh?"
"4144660","4148560"," I triggered that spy that I triggered a sell on that spy call."
"4148560","4153260"," I bought it at $0.48, sold it at $0.45. I'm going to take a look and see what"
"4153260","4153920"," they cost now."
"4157979","4160920"," You're now down to $0.43. So I'm glad I got out of that. "
"4161399","4165580"," And it does look like some bears just stepped in on algos on the spy."
"4166180","4168100"," They're all in on $4.70 P."
"4168680","4169880"," It looks like a split."
"4170439","4176620"," They were in on calls and then they just bought $0.470 P's on the spy expiring on Friday. "
"4185270","4186850"," So I'm knocked out of my first trade today."
"4191000","4195360"," Did you guys get those TQQ puts that I put up on at captain's alpha?"
"4202390","4206310"," Yeah, some puts coming across the board now, plug puts and video puts."
"4207570","4210730"," C puts, BA has puts coming out on it right now. "
"4228990","4230690"," This looks like theta gang to me."
"4230930","4232870"," This doesn't look like I saw the market."
"4235790","4237630"," Looks like yield theta gang. "
"4278340","4279800"," This might be a nice trade."
"4282340","4289240"," IBM, IBM January 14th, 137c."
"4290600","4292280"," Take a look at the chart. "
"4292860","4295180"," Qcom has some more puts coming in on it."
"4296360","4298600"," We know that 191 was the resistance."
"4303980","4305040"," What did I just do here?"
"4305040","4314260"," And you can see IBM trading up on its own this morning. "
"4316280","4317740"," What did I just do here?"
"4324300","4328720"," I'm going to bring up hood."
"4330660","4332060"," Sorry, quest for that."
"4362200","4366000"," Saw a golden put sweep come out for TSM. "
"4366660","4371580"," February 18th, 145p, $1.5 million."
"4379180","4385300"," More Nvidia puts, BAC puts, BAC had a lot of calls coming into it."
"4385420","4389160"," Now I'm getting some puts at June 17th for $42. "
"4390200","4399700"," XLE puts coming in January 28th, 62.5p. That would not bode well for"
"4399700","4400720"," the spy."
"4445240","4446480"," Let's see what they're doing."
"4449980","4464470"," Yeah, there's"
"4464470","4467010"," my guys hanging out down below here, 1361. "
"4467790","4469670"," That's what I'm still waiting on on."
"4470150","4472350"," I'm still waiting for my buy-in on the hood."
"4474370","4478550"," Got localized support at 1535, 1512. "
"4479430","4483010"," We got more sellers than buyers on hood this morning."
"4489170","4498940"," Let's take a look at IWM again, see"
"4498940","4503020"," if that is at a bottom or not."
"4525670","4529050"," I'm watching more TQQ puts coming in. "
"4529890","4536310"," Now I'm going to repost the TQQ puts for you because they're flowing in right now."
"4583160","4590520"," So we went from $600,000 in TQQ put flow."
"4591100","4596160"," We're now up to $1.4 million in TQQ put flow. "
"4596720","4615120"," And it's all on January 14th, all on 76.25. So"
"4615120","4616620"," we'll look up the queues next."
"4618040","4621040"," We'll look at IWM here, see if there's actual support."
"4621840","4624020"," Yeah, there's still more buyers than sellers here. "
"4625990","4633810"," This doesn't look as weak as it looks on the charts, but we'll look lower in case bears are"
"4633810","4635770"," interested in staying short in this."
"4636250","4637430"," Yeah, I don't see it."
"4638810","4641790"," It's just accumulation, just basing. "
"4643070","4645850"," I'm not seeing what maybe some of you guys are seeing out there."
"4646350","4649750"," We'll look at the queues and see if it's more damaging or more dangerous over there."
"4652370","4654830"," This just looks like sideways bullshit to me. "
"4658010","4661330"," Okay, I'm interested as to why maybe the queue."
"4661490","4668030"," I wonder if the TQQ puts are about bad ERs maybe or sell the news on good ERs."
"4668490","4671730"," I could just play some for the week and then find out. "
"4672170","4672830"," What am I looking at here?"
"4714740","4715860"," Let's take a look."
"4722360","4724260"," Maybe this is just the contract."
"4752900","4755400"," I'm not overly concerned here. "
"4756620","4758100"," Down 90 bucks."
"4759240","4761960"," So the queues you're on support right now, 385."
"4762900","4771720"," If we do sell off from here in tech, so you can put the"
"4771720","4774040"," indicator up here. "
"4775500","4777140"," Heroin indicator, close."
"4781890","4785550"," You do have more sellers right now on the queues."
"4796280","4798040"," Let's take a look right here. "
"4802380","4805500"," Bounce off 16,000, so you want to sell it down."
"4822270","4852250"," Heh"
"4874550","4874550"," heh heh heh."
"4891000","4898280"," And those TQQ puts are printing right now, starting to print. "
"4913700","4916640"," I'm going to post some flow on Ford."
"4919650","4921110"," It's been rising all morning."
"4966640","4968560"," And Ford's just ripping. "
"4968560","4983360"," I have"
"4983360","4985900"," lots of Baba calls coming in this morning as well."
"4988100","4997960"," Got January 14th, 136 C, March 18th, 150 C, February 18th,"
"4998080","5001060"," 140 C, and March 18th, 140 C."
"5053470","5066850"," And it"
"5066850","5072450"," does look like the call interest on Friday has disappeared from spy."
"5072450","5082390"," They're all in on the put side on 470 P, or the Algos, whomever was in calls are"
"5082390","5084430"," gone now in the spy. "
"5101000","5102360"," I'm taking a trip."
"5102540","5103300"," I took that one trade."
"5103480","5115780"," They got knocked out of, I don't know, and missed"
"5115780","5117160"," the Ford trade, which sucks. "
"5140890","5145330"," Emmy is coming into the support zone we were talking about earlier."
"5149010","5150790"," So we're going to look up Emmy again real quick."
"5150790","5153550"," They're at 543 at the moment. "
"5161840","5167080"," So we'll let Emmy catch up and take a look here and see if it'll find some buyers."
"5183410","5194290"," Still seeing Q's put flow come in QQQQ January 14th, 382 P TQQQ January 14th, 76 "
"5194290","5196370",".25 P."
"5198110","5204030"," And now seeing some more spy puts come in January 14th, 469 P."
"5204610","5214430"," I did see a dip buyer down below QQQ with January 14, 386 C, but it's being overwhelmed by put"
"5214430","5214830"," buyers."
"5219700","5226580"," And we're still in neutral territory on the sentiment on the day seeing some K web put flow come in"
"5226580","5226960"," as well. "
"5227440","5233900"," That might be a pair trade with that Russian ETF because that's another merging market ETF."
"5234160","5240040"," That's put flow on K web, January 14th, 36.92 is the strike."
"5248630","5258090"," Seeing some RK puts coming in March 18th, 81.22, VIX calls coming in January 14th, 17 "
"5258090","5264370",".5. And there is now a waterfall of TQQQ puts coming in. "
"5265650","5274390"," So I'm going to repost again TQQ because there is an actual waterfall of flow coming in negative on"
"5274390","5274890"," tech."
"5275730","5277270"," I'm going to repost this."
"5277470","5279110"," I'll post the Q's puts as well. "
"5288170","5290550"," And I'll post the spy puts along with it."
"5291670","5293410"," I'll throw some DVN in there too."
"5325860","5347890"," None of"
"5347890","5349650"," this is hedging. "
"5349950","5358090"," So it looks localized, but I'll be concerned about this TQQQ for a NASDAQ retest and pull back."
"5363140","5365340"," Chase nailed it this morning on the Q's."
"5365340","5371720"," I don't know if he said Q's or spy, but Chase was shouting out this morning that he was bearish"
"5371720","5372880"," on the market this morning. "
"5373400","5374040"," Good job, Chase."
"5381360","5390280"," Yeah, Emmy is still looking for that 5.30 down below 5.31, 5.28, 5.26 somewhere in here."
"5390440","5397480"," If we can get more selling down below here, you've got overwhelming sellers on Emmy. "
"5397480","5402520"," You've got 137,000 sellers to 50,000 buyers so far."
"5403040","5406080"," Hopefully we can get a capitulation move today on Emmy."
"5406440","5408180"," I'd be interested in buying this stock. "
"5410890","5413470"," So I'll keep you updated on Emmy as we move forward."
"5425380","5426020"," Nope, nope."
"5426880","5427240"," Keep. "
"5439220","5449490"," Nope, nope."
"5449490","5452650"," And I posted some updated Q's put flow."
"5453710","5455910"," I think it was the Q's and TQQ. "
"5458670","5461230"," Natural gas is selling off this morning."
"5467090","5469370"," You guys probably want to see Tesla too, right?"
"5470390","5471630"," I'll bring up Tesla for you."
"5513280","5517760"," Looks like that Tesla support they were trying to build at 1,100 failed. "
"5517760","5520440"," It also looked like what's going on here."
"5526120","5527380"," Looks like that support."
"5527720","5531740"," We'll check to see if that's a real support wall in Tesla down at 1072. "
"5573830","5582370"," You know, this 10 set, this 1080 up here, 1078, you want to mark a line on this on your"
"5582370","5583170"," charts here."
"5584330","5594160"," 1050 is where the smart money is still being overwhelmed by"
"5594160","5595880"," sellers on Tesla right now."
"5599490","5601930"," This might not be the dip that you buy at this moment. "
"5605330","5608410"," I'll leave that to leave this Tesla up for a minute here for you."
"5610930","5612270"," Bring this down."
"5612710","5614390"," Is that support even there?"
"5614390","5615910"," I guess this is the question. "
"5626720","5628020"," What's going on here with this?"
"5633540","5634400"," Right there."
"5637700","5651450"," Let's take a look at Tesla."
"5716280","5717640"," Oh, yeah, I should have bought that call. "
"5738180","5738820"," 75 cents."
"5775890","5782740"," Okay, so we were talking about RSX this morning."
"5783640","5791100"," Walter Bloomberg posted to put RSX Roger Sierra X ray on watch this morning. "
"5791840","5793720"," And I just saw a call flow."
"5793920","5794880"," Come on for that ticker."
"5794940","5797220"," I never see call flow for this ticker. "
"5797760","5802600"," So RSX April 14th, 28 C."
"5803400","5807220"," Someone spent $240,000 on RSX."
"5808200","5811400"," So we saw Walter Bloomberg this morning."
"5811880","5814240"," Shout out RSX the ticker. "
"5814360","5821240"," We took a look at it this morning and it looks like someone's taken a bite off of it for"
"5821240","5822020"," April."
"5822020","5824560"," That's you Walter Bloomberg out there to buy in those calls."
"5824820","5826760"," We can see them right now. "
"5829520","5835640"," So someone bought April 14th, 28 C on RSX, $240,000."
"5837000","5839060"," Someone else bought spy calls."
"5839540","5843220"," There's some forward flow coming in QQ calls coming in. "
"5844120","5847680"," I'm not sure if this is just a cash gap close from yesterday."
"5848560","5849660"," It doesn't seem unreasonable."
"5850620","5851540"," I will bounce here. "
"5870760","5877720"," But I do have to warn you that people are still in on those 470Ps that are the algos are"
"5877720","5879280"," still in on 470P."
"5880260","5882120"," So I'm going to wait here to buy in."
"5882320","5884080"," I was looking at 473C. "
"5884800","5886920"," They were down to like 70 cents at one point."
"5887060","5890820"," They're now up to 82 cents, but I'm still not completely sold on entering a position."
"5892160","5895420"," I'm very glad that I sold out of my 475s. "
"5895540","5898080"," It went down to like 33 cents at one point."
"5898620","5902800"," They're recovering right now, but I'm glad that I got out of 43 cents."
"5918860","5920540"," Let's take a look at AFRM next. "
"5921640","5923580"," Be careful here on Tesla."
"5923860","5925900"," You've got a really negative hero indicator."
"5926620","5929980"," You've got sellers overwhelming on Tesla. "
"5930940","5933720"," It looks like the smart money is down at 1050."
"5935560","5936280"," Excuse me."
"5936420","5938160"," That doesn't mean we go down to 1050 today. "
"5938700","5944480"," Just be careful of it because you're turning this 1080 and this 1085 into resistance at this point."
"5946020","5955540"," It looks like bulls are waiting for this 1050."
"5956100","5958120"," Still more Ford calls coming in. "
"5958480","5962120"," That'd be cautious of Ford calls at this point."
"5962740","5963500"," So you've got 1072."
"5964540","5968560"," Looks like it's holding right now, but you do have some resistance above here at 1080. "
"5968660","5971720"," You've got more sellers coming down usual stuff with Tesla."
"5972240","5974720"," See if you can buy 1050 on Tesla."
"5974720","5975800"," That'd be a buyer down here. "
"5977440","5983740"," We'll take a look at Ford next because Ford's been ripping all morning, but I want to see if this"
"5983740","5986140"," is just FOMO buyers on Ford or not."
"5987460","5989520"," Or if it's going to continue to rip today."
"5999710","6005630"," Some Lumen calls coming in April 14, 15C, $50,000. "
"6008210","6010030"," Let's see if we can get Ford to come up here."
"6010030","6013210"," I'm seeing some crazy Ford calls coming in."
"6017640","6019520"," Let's see if we can get Ford to pop up here. "
"6027260","6030400"," Yeah, I'm still waiting on Tesla on spy calls."
"6031200","6033600"," Not convinced yet to take a call position."
"6036720","6039140"," Looks like grinding of options. "
"6040680","6043820"," Even though spy puts are only up like 20%."
"6045120","6046160"," They're doing okay."
"6046360","6047180"," They're just not doing great. "
"6047180","6051220"," The one for one on spy puts, you really need spy to sell off."
"6051400","6054620"," You need spy to sell off like 10 points to print heavy."
"6060400","6063440"," So maybe they're trying to squeeze Ford right now. "
"6066600","6068460"," There's a squeeze attempt on Ford."
"6068860","6071400"," I don't like Ford calls anymore this morning either."
"6075860","6078260"," You've got crazy more buyers and sellers. "
"6078980","6080640"," Hero indicators off the charts."
"6081660","6086020"," It looks like the Ford gang is trying to squeeze."
"6092970","6096290"," Looks like all the buyers are centered down here at 24 bucks. "
"6098330","6104150"," If you do break through $26, $26.07, you are going to catch a squeeze on Ford today."
"6104490","6105630"," That'd be an interesting play."
"6105770","6107970"," It's very risky, but the payoff could be huge. "
"6109490","6111270"," And the Ford calls keep coming in."
"6113590","6115110"," The flow on Ford is wild."
"6115110","6117310"," All in April too. "
"6117530","6121730"," That is one key thing is you've got Ford April 14, 25 C."
"6122730","6124310"," Is now coming out on Ford."
"6124470","6129350"," When you see expansion in calls like this, it does set up for some form of a squeeze."
"6133840","6134900"," It's an interesting play. "
"6135480","6136360"," Dangerous play."
"6138040","6141420"," Because you can see that they're just ripping through resistance here."
"6142400","6145080"," The buy the dip kids should be down here at 24 bucks. "
"6145080","6152920"," But if they do break above this $25, $87, $26.02, there is a potential to squeeze Ford."
"6153820","6155400"," I don't know how you squeeze Ford."
"6155740","6158700"," It's got so many, so many shares out there. "
"6159620","6160860"," It's such a high float stock."
"6161160","6167440"," But anyways, if you like Ford by the dip of 24, you've got more buyers and sellers."
"6167980","6169400"," Hero indicator is very good right now. "
"6169400","6173340"," And the call expansion is all the way into April."
"6174440","6176760"," So it does look very positive right now."
"6194650","6200010"," Seeing some Twitter calls come in January 21st, 40 C."
"6202150","6207610"," New calls coming in NUE 120 C for January 21st. "
"6207610","6209330"," Uber calls coming in."
"6229330","6230570"," Give me a trade."
"6231110","6232270"," I don't have any trades. "
"6235130","6238130"," I just want to throw something on and take the rest of the day off."
"6239190","6240090"," What I want to do."
"6241170","6244810"," I feel like every time I'm waiting, every time I'm like, yeah, I'm going to take the day off today. "
"6245530","6247030"," I got roped in waiting for a trade."
"6247030","6256580"," I want to take a trade that"
"6256580","6257960"," expires tomorrow."
"6287170","6288270"," I see. "
"6288930","6291490"," I'm interested again in Viacom."
"6291790","6292970"," Viacom is still ripping."
"6293310","6293530"," Look at that. "
"6294010","6294090"," Beautiful."
"6294910","6295550"," Viacom is awesome."
"6296630","6297430"," What a great trade. "
"6307940","6309760"," I'm interested in hood again."
"6311300","6312840"," Here I go back to hood."
"6314620","6323880"," I haven't been reading you guys' texts over here. "
"6323920","6328320"," I'm trying to find a better trade than the TQQ trade."
"6330000","6331840"," TQQ forward was a good trade."
"6340800","6348980"," Yeah, we still got 15 bucks on $15 for low intraday support. "
"6349820","6352160"," We're still at $15.40 on hood."
"6353740","6359120"," What are the options Shane doing doing on hood this morning?"
"6361540","6363380"," Does it just take profit Friday?"
"6363860","6364900"," We have earnings for hood."
"6368580","6370380"," Let's see what we're looking at here. "
"6371580","6374080"," That's pinned on January 14 on puts."
"6375780","6379160"," 18c for the 21st has some interest."
"6380180","6381400"," 18c on hood. "
"6386970","6394650"," Not much interest after the 28th when they have their earnings call."
"6396810","6401770"," There's some interest on 19c on February 4 for hood."
"6406060","6407740"," I want to place a trade on hood here. "
"6410660","6412480"," They've got their earnings date coming up."
"6462690","6468030"," Yeah, and the implied is that Robinhood is going to not beat their estimate, right?"
"6481210","6482550"," I'm going to place a trade on hood."
"6488440","6490860"," If they surprise beat, they should rip. "
"6541300","6547020"," Let me check all the I've missed a bunch of guys is chat chat messages down here and trying to"
"6547020","6548100"," find a trade for Friday."
"6553280","6556280"," I think my chat, you know, I can't see the chat right now."
"6560860","6563440"," The chat, my chat is getting jacked up here. "
"6575900","6581760"," All right, I get the chats back on here."
"6596060","6600820"," If I'm you have seen some talk on discord right now for a frm."
"6601260","6601700"," Winky. "
"6601920","6603000"," Let me all bring it up for you."
"6605880","6609780"," Yeah, there should be no break below here on the spy either."
"6610500","6612380"," This doesn't look like saw the news to me. "
"6612400","6614200"," It just looks like noise."
"6614840","6616900"," It looks like sideways trading to me."
"6617040","6617320"," That's it. "
"6618280","6620760"," I'm not paranoid right now in the market selling off."
"6621280","6624320"," If you're a bear right now, I'm not fearful."
"6625720","6626740"," I got nothing for you. "
"6633270","6638090"," If any of you are bearish right now in the market, you should probably sign up for a spot gamma"
"6638090","6640290"," so you can get a better picture of where we are."
"6641390","6644370"," Oh, that was a nice bounce off a farm down here at 73 bucks."
"6644510","6645890"," That's why people were talking about it. "
"6645890","6655800"," Let's see if that we got a hero indicator"
"6655800","6656120"," here."
"6665010","6667410"," 70 bucks is your buy the dip on a frm."
"6667810","6669870"," Your price target is 79 bucks. "
"6674580","6677800"," Can't get bearish on the spy until you break through."
"6679620","6681420"," Let me take a look on ES and see."
"6684790","6686210"," Give you an accurate number here. "
"6700480","6700960"," Yes."
"6706960","6710990"," I know you guys want to get bearish on spy."
"6711490","6712150"," I understand that. "
"6720140","6722060"," No, just bouncing around."
"6724800","6732260"," Still need to break below 4700 and it was saved at 4699 75."
"6733320","6734800"," It all looks like sideways action. "
"6735740","6738280"," I will say though, I will give you this."
"6738280","6745860"," If we continue to trade sideways, we've been trading sideways in the spy since January 11th."
"6747100","6752520"," If we continue to trade sideways in the spy for too long, we will see a downward move. "
"6754440","6755040"," Into."
"6757820","6759500"," We'll give the bears one thing."
"6760480","6765260"," If we don't resolve on sideways movement, we tend to trade down. "
"6765780","6767460"," Not always, but we tend to."
"6768560","6772980"," Let's say we trade sideways for five days."
"6773720","6775480"," You'll get a capitulation move down. "
"6776080","6783400"," If you bearish, I would say every time we hit 4736 or so, just keep taking shorts until we do"
"6783400","6783920"," get a breakdown."
"6785020","6787600"," If we do get a breakdown, it could break down to 465."
"6788840","6790740"," That's all I could tell you if you're a bear out there. "
"6791460","6796020"," If you're a bull, this just looks like more sideways, right?"
"6796220","6796960"," That's all it looks like."
"6798660","6805380"," I wouldn't be taking short at 470, but I would be taking short of your bearish every time we hit"
"6805380","6806260"," above 473."
"6807100","6812500"," You could take a short or a put, trade it down, and then you would pick it back up if"
"6812500","6813300"," you were bearish. "
"6813740","6817660"," If you're looking for that capitulation move, you'd pick it back up below 470."
"6817660","6824640"," If you want to see a hold below 470, and maybe you get a capitulation move to quote-unquote retest,"
"6825260","6826620"," which everyone likes to say."
"6826740","6831920"," It has to retest, I don't believe that, but if you wanted to pick up another short, you'd wait"
"6831920","6833620"," until we break below 469. "
"6834560","6839960"," Take it to 463 or 466 or 465."
"6841740","6846420"," You want to get out of your shorts or puts around that level of 4700."
"6847240","6848680"," But this is just sideways trading. "
"6848920","6850240"," There's nothing going on here."
"6851760","6854980"," And you've got OPEC's tomorrow, so I don't know."
"6855160","6855600"," It's kind of tough. "
"6856900","6864060"," I am watching a lot of puts coming in right now in AMD, RK, Nvidia, Spy, tons of puts coming"
"6864060","6864280"," in."
"6864800","6869240"," Spy 114, 465P across the board."
"6869540","6876280"," I guess that's the play for bears right now, is to lean in on spy puts at the moment. "
"6877440","6878900"," They want to tag that 465."
"6881400","6885880"," I'll give you, I'll post this flow for you if you are bearish so that you can get your trade"
"6885880","6886200"," on."
"6889890","6894010"," I'll post this on Twitter so that you can see the exact numbers on it. "
"6896130","6898150"," It's got the RK stuff in there."
"6898630","6900470"," Some other tech puts in there."
"6901610","6902430"," Hang tight here. "
"6904530","6907450"," And I'm not in any trade right now if anyone wants to know."
"6913700","6916400"," I'm not convinced on the capitulation move."
"6917200","6917540"," Maybe. "
"6918240","6922540"," I think we will get the capitulation move possibly because we continue to trade sideways."
"6923160","6925600"," Maybe it's like sideways and slightly down eventually."
"6925600","6929000"," I just don't know that I like it today. "
"6930600","6932080"," So I just posted it on Twitter."
"6932800","6936620"," So if you if you bears want to lean in right now, if this is your if you're committed to"
"6936620","6938000"," this, then."
"6939040","6941480"," I just posted the play for you to 465. "
"6943640","6944120"," 465P."
"6947460","6949740"," It's January 14th."
"6950600","6952760"," That actually could could print quite well. "
"6952760","6953760"," Maybe I'll go in on that."
"6955520","6956160"," You know what?"
"6956340","6957440"," I'm going to win that myself."
"6958440","6960520"," I'm going to take those those puts spy. "
"6960760","6961380"," I'm going to join the bears."
"6964620","6967680"," See January 14th, 465P."
"6968160","6968700"," They're cheap. "
"6968920","6970280"," They're only 65 cents."
"6971980","6972780"," I'll buy those."
"6973420","6974260"," I'm with you guys bears. "
"6974440","6975560"," You guys you bears want to get out of 465."
"6976820","6977400"," I'm in."
"6978580","6978980"," Nope. "
"6979240","6982280"," I'm not in trying to charge me a premium on puts."
"6982280","6985660"," What the fuck are you guys doing?"
"6986700","6988880"," Oh, you are trying to send me a premium on puts."
"6997970","7000110"," I got an order in for 65 cents. "
"7000330","7002510"," It did bump to 67 cents."
"7004650","7006410"," I'll see if I get a fill here at 65."
"7008890","7009870"," I'll join the bears. "
"7010670","7013430"," They're claimed they're calling for 465 today."
"7014330","7015530"," So I'm with you bears for now."
"7019190","7020210"," Let's see if I get a fill. "
"7024860","7025520"," I'm in."
"7026860","7028240"," 65 cents, right?"
"7028620","7029580"," 63 cents."
"7029780","7030620"," They're down to now here. "
"7030720","7032480"," Here's where the bears get fucked every day."
"7036470","7038170"," So I'm trading with the bears today."
"7042510","7043370"," Okay, bears. "
"7044210","7048550"," I'm on 65P expiring tomorrow and we're going up."
"7049310","7051110"," Tell me when I start making money here."
"7055030","7056510"," I'm with the bears. "
"7058510","7061290"," 65 or four 65 P."
"7063770","7065650"," I don't believe this is going to hold true."
"7068370","7069990"," But there is a lot of flow for the bears."
"7070370","7070970"," So I'll show you. "
"7071090","7074550"," I'm going to repost an update on spy puts."
"7075330","7077130"," This is where the bears lose all their money."
"7077250","7077910"," I hate doing this. "
"7083160","7088060"," Bears get all frothy and committed sweaty during the dance club."
"7088060","7090260"," Like we're going down."
"7091700","7092600"," Bear holiday. "
"7094060","7098920"," So I'll hold these with a with an iron fist, even if they get out of value, even add some"
"7098920","7099380"," to them."
"7100760","7102760"," I'll I'll dive in hand with the bears."
"7110390","7113850"," Okay, so I just updated spy puts on Twitter. "
"7115170","7120130"," Looks like everybody's going balls deep on 465 P."
"7125440","7127740"," So we'll see if that actually works out for the bears."
"7131730","7137290"," It's funny because whenever I go bearish with the bears, I have to place my bets and then go lock"
"7137290","7138330"," myself in a bunker."
"7138870","7143270"," Like go downstairs or go out, not down to the go out in the backyard, open up the bomb shelter. "
"7144410","7148430"," Climb down the old wooden staircase, lock the gate up top."
"7148850","7151270"," I have to turn off and smash my cell phone with a hammer."
"7152150","7158530"," Then I got a place that I got to turn on the turn or smash my my hand radio and"
"7158530","7162690"," then I don't come out until Friday morning or something or Friday afternoon and see if they"
"7162690","7163250"," actually printed. "
"7166970","7169030"," Yeah, and they're already down 10%."
"7170250","7170730"," 20%."
"7170730","7172310"," We have 56 cents. "
"7173090","7178270"," So we're down 20% already on those are almost 15% on those spy puts."
"7178350","7178770"," So we'll see."
"7179350","7180750"," I'll dive in hand with the bears. "
"7181730","7182370"," We'll see it."
"7182370","7184690"," We'll see if they print print heavy or not."
"7191300","7192300"," I don't think we go down. "
"7192420","7193200"," I think we trade sideways."
"7223740","7226320"," Yeah, I don't see this 465 trade here."
"7226480","7232680"," This looks more like a price target of 475, but I'll stay with the bears. "
"7234940","7236060"," I'll add to the position."
"7241040","7242140"," I don't believe the bears."
"7242600","7243620"," I think we trade sideways. "
"7243620","7246620"," I think we trade between 473, 475."
"7248020","7251460"," We did a cashback down below at 468."
"7252280","7255920"," I think we trade in this range for until tomorrow. "
"7255920","7260500"," I think that the market maker is going to make this a sideways trading range into Friday."
"7261980","7267160"," So I'm going to hold on to these puts with the bears and see if they're lying to me or"
"7267160","7267360"," not."
"7267520","7269520"," I think that they are, but who knows. "
"7270300","7272760"," We're probably going to bounce around in here for the next two days."
"7272760","7274100"," I'm going to take off here."
"7274200","7276940"," I'm going to turn off the video, turn off the audio. "
"7277580","7279000"," You guys want to watch this all day long?"
"7279120","7279360"," You can."
"7279640","7282740"," I'll come back and check up on Tesla at some point."
"7284860","7287780"," I need to work on the Discord this morning and the websites. "
"7288140","7291140"," I'm going to give Joe a call if he's listening in this morning in the broadcast."
"7292880","7297000"," If we sell off, I'll be back, but otherwise I'm going to work on the Discord."
"7297280","7297820"," I'm going to work on. "
"7298080","7300640"," I've got some other stuff I've got to work on too for the livestream."
"7301500","7303280"," I've got some stuff to add to the livestream."
"7304060","7308000"," I've got the website to work on so you guys will have a place to discuss things. "
"7308580","7311980"," We can post this stream in the Discord, all that kind of stuff."
"7312260","7314820"," So I'm going to sign off here at this moment."
"7316240","7318580"," I don't see any of the flow coming in other than some. "
"7319260","7322820"," See, it looks to me like the bears are playing the range too."
"7322980","7328640"," It doesn't look like nothing here looks like it's bearish or bullish."
"7328640","7330400"," It just looks like range trading. "
"7331080","7332260"," That's all it looks like."
"7335080","7342680"," The only thing I could give the bears, if I gave the bears something, it would be that we're"
"7342680","7343760"," sideways trading, right?"
"7344360","7346020"," Or one day, two days."
"7346360","7347280"," This will be the third day. "
"7348020","7352800"," Sometimes by the fifth day, you'll get some downward move, some capitulation."
"7354200","7356460"," The buyers are, but I don't see the buyers."
"7356460","7360960"," The one thing that my only problem I have right now is that there are no buyers below on the"
"7360960","7361180"," spy. "
"7362320","7365940"," You've got a heroin indicator that's through the roof for the call for calls."
"7366900","7369000"," I don't see any lines down here."
"7369080","7370860"," It's like the banks are waiting down below at 465. "
"7371600","7372840"," They're not waiting down below at 450."
"7374460","7379960"," You have sellers above at 475, which leads me to believe that the banks know we're going up from"
"7379960","7380140"," here."
"7381160","7383080"," So I don't know what to say to you guys out there. "
"7384560","7387380"," I'm not as bearish as some of you guys are out here right now."
"7388380","7389260"," But I'm holding puts."
"7389660","7391440"," So let me know if they print. "
"7392380","7393520"," This is I'm doing this one."
"7393820","7396580"," As I know that the bears think I don't get bearish with them and I will."
"7396740","7397540"," I'll get bearish with you guys. "
"7399820","7403920"," So I'm going to sign off right now and I'll check back in later on this afternoon."
"7661240","7663560"," Someone was just asking about Zoom earlier."
"7663560","7668020"," I posted some zoom calls on at captains alpha. "
"7668820","7671180"," Big big call block $1.2 million."
"10601220","10604580"," Sweet looks like I've got some puts printing over here."
"10606860","10613480"," So let's see if we trade down to 464 down here or if the support comes in right where we"
"10613480","10613740"," are. "
"10615160","10617960"," So I've got some 465 P's."
"10619000","10620120"," Let's have a look."
"10622940","10623760"," What do I got?"
"10625140","10635830"," So there are 56 cents there now $1.18. Man,"
"10635950","10636910"," it just doesn't print. "
"10637630","10638950"," Send it down to 464."
"10645470","10647130"," Where's 464 at?"
"10648210","10649730"," That's where the supply side is."
"10650790","10652490"," See if they come back up or not. "
"10657600","10660890"," This would be real nice down here like 464 16."
"10662180","10664780"," But it does look like some buyers are stepping in."
"10665100","10669880"," Let me know if you guys are still holding your puts or if you're going to cash them out right"
"10669880","10670180"," here. "
"10675740","10679360"," Somewhere going on with my chat box is not working today."
"10687740","10689200"," Y'all look at Tessa for you guys."
"10689840","10691200"," So my spy puts are printing. "
"10691940","10697740"," I'm wondering right now if the buyers are stepping up from 464 or not."
"10698020","10699920"," We talked about 450 this morning, right?"
"10700620","10701100"," On Tesla."
"10701720","10702740"," That's where the money was. "
"10704300","10706720"," It does look like money's moved up a little bit on Tesla."
"10707660","10710180"," But you know that the money's at 1050, right?"
"10710380","10711060"," We don't need to check Tesla."
"10711280","10712740"," We know the Tesla's at 1050. "
"10715380","10716880"," You know, this is where the buyers are."
"10717320","10718180"," 1050 on Tesla."
"10718540","10719320"," Nothing's changed on that. "
"10724710","10726070"," Yeah, I wasn't listening to it."
"10726090","10727430"," I wasn't listening to Brainard."
"10733320","10735480"," Chase is saying to get out of my puts right now. "
"10735480","10735800"," All right."
"10735980","10736640"," I'm going to sell my puts."
"10740540","10742280"," Maybe I'll add the call side now. "
"10746360","10747700"," I'm going to add some calls."
"10748000","10749300"," I'm going to add 475s again."
"10749440","10750200"," They're dirt cheap now. "
"10750820","10752320"," They were like 38 cents earlier."
"10753140","10754660"," 45th cents, I think at the start of the day."
"10754940","10755540"," 60 cents. "
"10756160","10758620"," I might add some 475s here."
"10768140","10768940"," All right."
"10768940","10769480"," My puts. "
"10773620","10775080"," I like this."
"10775240","10776640"," I like this down here."
"10777340","10781480"," I like this 464 down here, but it looks like buyers are stepping in. "
"10782420","10785440"," Here are indicators turning quite bullish right now."
"10786180","10788020"," We still have more sellers on spy."
"10792050","10795250"," Tesla's getting close to that 1050 mark as well. "
"10796010","10798470"," So I don't know if we break through 1050 today."
"10800270","10801330"," Let's have a look see."
"10801970","10804590"," Let's see what the next layer of buyers are on Tesla. "
"10806270","10808650"," If we can actually break through here at 467."
"10810150","10810590"," Yeah."
"10810710","10812570"," So you got light support at 1040. "
"10813750","10816090"," Light buyers at 1000, but it does."
"10816290","10818510"," This looks like pretty good support for Tesla."
"10820430","10823190"," I'm not going to expect spy to fall much more. "
"10823370","10824070"," I want it to go to."
"10824290","10826690"," I want Tesla to go to 464."
"10827390","10828710"," I just don't know if we're going to get it. "
"10830510","10831910"," That was a nice trade."
"10832670","10833650"," That was a nice spy trade."
"10836510","10838470"," I'm going to add some calls here in a moment. "
"10838510","10840130"," I want to make sure that's just bottoming out."
"10841110","10842450"," I'll take the call side on spy."
"10847820","10851660"," There's some more spy puts coming in right now, but. "
"10853760","10855900"," It looks like it's FOMO buyers."
"10856240","10858380"," FOMO put buyers doesn't look like bears."
"10860020","10861500"," It's like people late to the party. "
"10865760","10869820"," So I just bought some 475 C's expiring on Friday."
"10871120","10874480"," They are that cost me 14 cents."
"10875400","10878400"," We'll see if we still have a lot of puts here at 324. "
"10879400","10883640"," But if I can get these calls to go up to like 30 or 40 or 50 cents."
"10884560","10885080"," It should be a good."
"10885300","10885760"," It should be a good. "
"10886380","10886460"," Goodbye."
"10892600","10894580"," So I'm now on the long side of."
"10896020","10896460"," Spy. "
"10899680","10901020"," So we'll see what happens here."
"10901020","10902880"," If we actually trade down to 464."
"10903520","10909680"," If we trade down to 464, I might throw some like 465 C's on, but. "
"10910280","10913200"," This looks like it's the this is this is done for today."
"10913420","10913940"," We'll find out."
"10917200","10921340"," There's a lot of call structure coming in now on the spy and the buyers are stepping back in here. "
"10922440","10923420"," That was a good trade."
"10923420","10924420"," It was a real good."
"10924480","10925660"," Well, it was 100% trade. "
"10925800","10927960"," I didn't make a ton off it, but I'll take it."
"10929480","10930300"," I'll take it."
"10930380","10930900"," God damn it. "
"10934480","10938740"," They're closing millions in SPX January with 31 4500 puts."
"10939880","10940120"," Yeah."
"10940240","10941140"," Tesla support it. "
"10941260","10943100"," We're right on Tesla support right now, aren't we?"
"10944020","10945300"," This is major support."
"10945560","10948640"," Your next move down really is a thousand."
"10949120","10950080"," So you'd have to consider. "
"10950080","10953240"," Do we head from 10 50 down to 1000 or not?"
"10954540","10957400"," There is a reaction in the market at the moment on the spy."
"10959320","10964180"," Looks like that guy for I saw the one part with the guy for Montana that was talking about how"
"10964180","10966160"," inflation was high in Montana."
"10968800","10970100"," So I went came and checked. "
"10970800","10971340"," I was eating a lot."
"10971400","10972180"," I was in the middle of eating lunch."
"10976120","10977100"," That was a nice trade. "
"10988440","10988880"," Yeah."
"10988980","10991620"," And there's some QQQ calls coming back in right now."
"10993120","10993560"," Yeah. "
"10993720","10996900"," There's some QQQ puts too, but I don't know."
"10997460","10998860"," Let me look at the cues real quick."
"10999980","11001840"," I want to see if we actually break through. "
"11002220","11005400"," I do want to warn you if you're a Tesla bull that not worn, I guess."
"11006160","11012240"," Are you still a slightly negative hero and you've got more sellers than buyers on Tesla, but it's"
"11012240","11013360"," not like it was earlier."
"11014600","11016420"," But you do see down here. "
"11016740","11020900"," Sometimes you'll get that like quick dip down and then some buyers to dump it up, bring it up."
"11021400","11023280"," So 10 50 is actual support."
"11024020","11027480"," 10 41, you might catch a really cheap call down here. "
"11028160","11032020"," And the next question would be if you're not bullish, do you think it goes to a thousand?"
"11032600","11034740"," That's that's really is the next level down below."
"11036500","11037500"," Let's see where it is."
"11047850","11056430"," So the next level down below is 10.07. There's some light buyers above a 10.06. It seems like"
"11056430","11058650"," a pretty fair place for major support. "
"11060630","11063370"," Or Tesla, but the buyers are at 10 50."
"11063790","11065930"," They were they've been waiting there all along since the bell."
"11067690","11068210"," 990. "
"11068490","11070450"," There's really firm support at 990."
"11071570","11073810"," This is not a bad place to take along in Tesla."
"11073810","11077490"," I think could be wrong on that, but we're getting there. "
"11077710","11083190"," It's get it's getting to that point where I'm not going to make I'm not going to risk going short"
"11083190","11084390"," down to 464."
"11085330","11086870"," It's too close now, I think."
"11089250","11090390"," We're not enough money. "
"11092390","11093750"," I could be wrong on that, but."
"11095530","11095970"," Yeah."
"11096590","11097650"," So what do I got now?"
"11097970","11099550"," So those calls are up a penny. "
"11099550","11104970"," I bought them it for 14 cents about 475 see they're up to 15 cents."
"11106110","11110770"," They'll need to print today, I think, because I think by tomorrow, no little think we're going to"
"11110770","11110950"," 475."
"11111930","11114530"," So there has to be a little bit of interest left in them today. "
"11114670","11118990"," So I'm going to look for a trade higher for the rest of the afternoon."
"11119710","11127320"," I'm going to go back to work on the discord and my expectation would be that we trade up to"
"11127320","11129180"," at least 470."
"11131640","11132120"," 468, 470. "
"11134540","11136280"," And I'll get back to you guys in a little bit."
"11136700","11137280"," That was a good trade."
"11149710","11152570"," Yeah, someone was asking, can 1050 get pulled?"
"11153150","11157470"," You know, the levels can be pulled at any level can be pulled. "
"11157670","11158550"," It can be rug pulled out."
"11158870","11161110"," But when you're looking over the whole week here."
"11162790","11165650"," You're going to need to see some some significant selling. "
"11165650","11169130"," You really want to be looking for lots of Tesla puts here."
"11170550","11171990"," To break through this level."
"11172390","11173910"," These are pretty significant levels. "
"11174190","11176310"," When you're at 1051,950."
"11177510","11181430"," You don't want to be short on Tesla until we break below 1047."
"11182290","11186910"," If you're a bear, you want to take it to 1050, get out, take it again down to 1000. "
"11188090","11189570"," These are major supports."
"11190190","11191290"," You know, you can't say that these aren't."
"11191370","11192710"," We set it right at the open this morning. "
"11193670","11196270"," Looked like these buyers had moved up to 1060."
"11197590","11199630"," And then they moved slightly lower to 1050."
"11201450","11206510"," So it's not unreasonable to think that this is a bottom for a moment. "
"11207950","11209410"," And think of it from this perspective."
"11209730","11213670"," If you've got buyers below spy at 464."
"11215510","11220810"," If if we have buyers below spy at 464, think about just like technically. "
"11221550","11222250"," Wait a minute."
"11222330","11224630"," So we have buyers here at 464, right?"
"11225090","11228910"," If Tesla drops 50 points, we would go below 464."
"11229810","11234650"," So seeing this here leads me to believe that even if we drop a little bit. "
"11235330","11238510"," I don't I don't see the Tesla to 10,000 or 2000."
"11239630","11240170"," Trade."
"11240670","11241290"," I don't see it. "
"11249670","11250790"," I don't see it."
"11252950","11256650"," I think that would force the I think that would force Tesla down."
"11256830","11261650"," If Tesla went down to 1000, it probably impact the spy down to 460. "
"11262990","11265090"," You'd see 460 not 464."
"11265570","11270350"," So if I had to guess where this is a bot, this is close to a bottom for us."
"11271330","11272050"," Pretty close. "
"11273030","11274710"," You could take the trade down to 460."
"11276430","11278930"," But I don't I don't know if it prints or not."
"11278930","11280950"," Like I can't it's unclear to me. "
"11281510","11284390"," I can look at Apple and maybe Apple can tell a better story."
"11285350","11288590"," Because if Apple's got dip buyers way lower, that would work too."
"11291310","11297270"," I don't like I like to see like if the buyers were at 460 on spy. "
"11298090","11301670"," I would say that a thousand bucks is on the table for Tesla all day long."
"11301670","11304970"," I would say that they know that other dropping it to that point."
"11304970","11313870"," I'm looking for confirmation outside of the index and stocks that are holding it up. "
"11316090","11318050"," Yeah, see like this ain't showing."
"11319510","11324010"," I guess Apple like Apple here is showing buyers."
"11324610","11327850"," If Apple traded down set doesn't make sense either. "
"11328490","11330050"," It's like here's the example."
"11330350","11330430"," Okay."
"11331010","11335470"," If Apple traded down to 165, then the spy would go to probably 460. "
"11335470","11341610"," If you had like Apple dumped down to 165, you had Tesla dumped down to 165."
"11343070","11343870"," Excuse me too."
"11344030","11345250"," Tesla dumped down to a thousand. "
"11345930","11347670"," And you would see the buyers on the spy."
"11349590","11352470"," You would see the buyers on spy moving down."
"11354290","11356130"," You would see them not at 464. "
"11356510","11360170"," You'd see them more down here like four fifty or even lower."
"11362290","11363590"," I don't see them that low."
"11365710","11367850"," I have to chew on this and think about it. "
"11367950","11368590"," I don't think so."
"11369090","11371230"," They're not matching where the spy buyers are."
"11371810","11372830"," That's my only concern. "
"11376940","11381300"," I want to see if there's I want to see if they're actually spy buyers that are lower."
"11384240","11385540"," We will take a look."
"11387480","11392800"," Yeah, see you'd see like you'd see a giant red line right here at like 460. "
"11392800","11399580"," If you knew that if you knew tech was going to fall down to 46 to like if you saw"
"11399580","11403860"," Apple keep crashing, you saw Tesla crash down to a thousand bucks."
"11403960","11405120"," You'd see the buyers down here."
"11405120","11406940"," You wouldn't see them here at 465. "
"11409260","11410140"," 464 33."
"11410520","11410880"," I don't know."
"11411080","11411480"," It's possible. "
"11412080","11413440"," I'm not saying it can't happen."
"11413520","11415980"," I'm saying that it's been taking my money and I'm running."
"11416580","11417260"," So I'm saying. "
"11420920","11421500"," All right."
"11421600","11422540"," So we'll see what happens here."
"11422540","11425860"," We'll see if a spy trades back up. "
"11426480","11430160"," Well, I'm going to put a resistance on spy on the daily."
"11430860","11431260"," We'll see."
"11431620","11433520"," We'll see if we break above. "
"11436460","11438360"," See if we break above 476."
"11439520","11442840"," If we break above 476, I'll get more bullish on spy."
"11443680","11446920"," But if not, I don't know what to say to you. "
"11447740","11449640"," And my calls are only up a penny."
"11452280","11453900"," So let's see what happens."
"11458610","11459330"," All right. "
"11459510","11459830"," Back to work."
"11461290","11488760"," I do"
"11488760","11490040"," want to say one more thing."
"11492540","11496120"," Two more market notes for you out there that you want to pay attention to. "
"11497560","11502400"," We did not trade lower than."
"11505160","11507980"," We did not trade lower on the week yet."
"11508980","11510940"," So the week is still bullish. "
"11512780","11514140"," On the 10th."
"11514680","11517380"," Our low was 456 60."
"11517560","11518320"," That's our low, right?"
"11520740","11524420"," So you'd want to see us trade lower than that by Friday. "
"11524660","11525640"," If you're bearish."
"11527140","11531180"," Also, we did trade lower than."
"11532000","11534660"," No, we did not trade lower than Tuesday. "
"11536300","11539340"," We did trade lower than Wednesday."
"11540760","11542980"," So we are lower than Wednesday's lows."
"11543280","11543700"," So the bulls. "
"11545260","11547180"," Kind of have to trade."
"11549100","11552440"," They kind of have to make an all new weekly all time high."
"11552700","11558200"," Bulls kind of need to close today above 473 20. "
"11560560","11564060"," So the bulls have to kind of close above 473 20."
"11564060","11568160"," If they don't close above 473 20."
"11568880","11573680"," We switched to a new low made versus yesterday, right?"
"11574320","11576680"," And a failure to to trade higher on the week. "
"11578080","11582980"," So this could signify if we don't trade above 473 20."
"11583120","11585520"," This could be signifying a rollover."
"11585820","11587940"," You'd also be looking for today's high. "
"11588840","11593420"," Another significant number for 7285 is a significant number."
"11594060","11597280"," You'd want to see us break and at least close above that."
"11598520","11604140"," So if you are a bear or a bull out there, you're looking for some technical moves to take place"
"11604140","11604520"," today. "
"11606260","11610280"," And if those technical moves don't happen from now into the bell."
"11611080","11614700"," They would signify a rolling over of this week."
"11615260","11620360"," You could probably take another short position at the end of the day. "
"11621560","11624840"," If we don't if we fail to beat."
"11627260","11630200"," You know, like if you're if you're a bull or a bear."
"11630660","11633640"," You're looking for us to break above three significant numbers. "
"11635400","11638040"," 471 28 or so 471."
"11641260","11643220"," 35 472 88."
"11644100","11646400"," And 473 20. "
"11647120","11652220"," So if you if if if you're a bull or a bear if we don't break higher than those three."
"11652960","11656060"," It gets more and more bearish as we head into the end of the day."
"11658280","11660520"," Just be conscious of that as the day moves forward. "
"11683970","11686170"," Yeah, I should have discord up and running today."
"11686990","11688790"," I still haven't called Joe yet about the website."
"11689070","11695790"," So I'll be calling him and I should have discord close to opening up at some point today. "
"12917940","12925120"," Just had some XBI calls coming in and I put some of you guys are playing XBI XBI February 18."
"12925900","12934560"," 100 C for $270,000 XBI February 18 100 C."
"12942770","12951800"," Also just Apple calls come in June 17 200 C for $750,000."
"12962320","12971910"," One more call come in C as in Charlie June 17 72.5 C for $800,000"
"12971910","12973590"," $760,000. "
"12974030","13190080"," I want"
"13190080","13196080"," to show you here that the hero indicator is starting to turn up on the day."
"13196860","13199460"," At this point to just keep keep that in mind."
"13200040","13205860"," Also notice that the volume is increasing at this moment as well on the spy. "
"13207540","13213820"," I'll take a look at the Tesla right now and see if the hero indicator is still down or up."
"13224250","13226730"," I'm going to get a little bit of a bounce here on the hero indicator."
"13232280","13242260"," Back here at 12 or basically at 1250 PM seeing support increase here at this"
"13242260","13243220"," 1050 level. "
"13243840","13250320"," Here indicators doing slightly better on the spy than it is on Tesla."
"13335480","13342640"," One other note is for tomorrow we have JPM earnings, Citibank earnings, Wells Fargo earnings,"
"13343800","13346180"," BlackRock and First Republic Bank."
"13347060","13351180"," So pay attention to XLF and those tickers for tomorrow. "
"13351720","13355440"," I will try to post so you guys have it for next week."
"13355560","13360120"," I'll post next week's earning calendar on Twitter in the next half hour or so."
"13360580","13367340"," As a matter of fact, I'll try to post if I can post for the entire month, I will. "
"13367840","13369140"," I'll post for the rest of January."
"15124510","15131430"," Just a heads up that I posted in earnings calendar spreadsheet on at captains alpha."
"15132310","15138910"," What you can do is copy and paste into your own spreadsheet and then delete, make notes, whatever"
"15138910","15139930"," you like to do. "
"15141570","15144430"," So that you can follow along for the month."
"15145130","15149110"," It has all their earnings information expectations, all that kind of stuff."
"15150470","15153230"," You can kind of whittle down what you're going to track for January. "
"15154330","15155570"," I will update with February."
"15156910","15159970"," Probably take me a day or two to get that up, but I'll have February's up."
"15161430","15167110"," In case you want to make some trades that are farther out and track them as you go along. "
"15190560","15195540"," Watch some puts come in on the spy, but you're seeing this bottom here firm up now."
"15195680","15196700"," Was that 464?"
"15197720","15201440"," Looks like buyers are stepping up to 465."
"15201900","15204100"," Make a note that the buyers are stepping up here. "
"15342550","15347130"," I'll be back on live with audio at 3 p.m. today."
"16058560","16060720"," Alright, here's the chart for BBBY."
"16061260","16065920"," We got more buyers and sellers. "
"16066340","16067600"," There is no hero indicator."
"16069020","16071920"," We've got some resistance here at 1633."
"16073560","16077880"," A little bit of resistance at 1692 and then you're looking for 1795. "
"16078980","16084340"," I don't know if you get there today, but if you do sell out, your buy the dip is at"
"16084340","16084700"," $13."
"16088110","16090810"," You also have some buyers at 1386."
"16103360","16105060"," Roblox with a nice bounce off 81. "
"16105940","16107640"," Huge buyers at 80 bucks."
"16108740","16112200"," A little bit of sellers stepping in here at 8245."
"16123470","16126750"," Price target on Roblox is 8813. "
"16143760","16145920"," Yeah, wakey saying you could buy it at 13."
"16147260","16148360"," You guys hear me?"
"16151000","16151800"," Hey everybody."
"16153080","16155160"," So I just stopped what I was doing there. "
"16156300","16160860"," As I showed Roblox, I showed someone else is asking for something else over there."
"16162620","16165120"," MRVL, I'll do MRVL, L for you real quick."
"16190270","16193510"," I haven't even checked spy here for a check spy. "
"16194250","16195770"," I haven't even looked at my charts here."
"16195890","16196890"," I got some calls out on spy."
"16198250","16199650"," They got calls out on spy. "
"16200110","16201490"," It looks like they were up there for a minute."
"16202430","16205070"," I'm going to check back on them around 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock."
"16206650","16208490"," My assumption is that we're going up here. "
"16209690","16220570"," So MRVL, Marvel looks like the bounce opportunity at $80.67. More"
"16220570","16222750"," buyers down below it's $78."
"16223370","16224570"," Blue skies above here though."
"16226630","16228090"," Marvel is a nice ticker. "
"16228250","16234670"," You got some great support here at 80 bucks, $78, $75, $70."
"16236150","16238630"," You've got no sellers until 88 bucks."
"16238630","16241270"," See if there's any sellers even higher than that. "
"16243910","16244910"," That's nice support."
"16245730","16248850"," You've got some crazy buyers stepping in here on Marvel."
"16249670","16250790"," Good shout out on that ticker. "
"16252990","16254130"," It's got nice support."
"16258290","16259690"," Hey Marcus, how are you?"
"16262760","16264540"," Look at Amazon for you guys."
"16271100","16271540"," AMZN. "
"16276430","16276870"," Subscribe."
"16282400","16284260"," Yeah, I'm doing Amazon right now for you."
"16287220","16288680"," Winky's playing the range in Qualcomm. "
"16289200","16290860"," Yeah, Qualcomm's been a great trade."
"16296760","16298680"," Qualcomm's been a great range trade."
"16298900","16300920"," We talked about the Qualcomm yesterday didn't we?"
"16301420","16303660"," And then it ended up ripping to like 191 today or something. "
"16305460","16306960"," We're on Tesla right now still."
"16306960","16309200"," Tesla caught that great bounce off 1050."
"16309900","16311340"," We knew that there was support there. "
"16312340","16317560"," We talked about, you know, did it look like Tesla would go down to 1000?"
"16318880","16323960"," It wasn't matching up with where the buyers were on spy, where the bit where the bottom was on spy."
"16324420","16332040"," Like when you start to check Apple spy against or Apple and you start to check check underlying"
"16332040","16334100"," components of the spy and the cues."
"16334680","16337880"," You're looking for some kind of matching up and there wasn't any matching up. "
"16338000","16341240"," So it's not, not, not surprising to see the bounce here on Tesla."
"16342000","16348320"," We'll check Amazon too because it's a big waiter on the indexes."
"16351260","16352280"," You guys are all scared. "
"16352680","16354560"," All these look like they're at bases where I'm looking."
"16355220","16360900"," And then you're seeing the, you're seeing the base or the support raised up on the spy from from"
"16360900","16365580"," one from four 64 to four 65 earlier."
"16365580","16373700"," So if I, if you saw the support way down on spy, like for 60, then I would have some"
"16373700","16377040"," concern for Tesla crashing crashing through to 1000. "
"16377140","16380720"," But when they don't match up like that, I don't think, I think we're going that low."
"16381360","16385860"," We knew yesterday about a dip on Tesla or Amazon was 32 hundred, right?"
"16386419","16388300"," And it wound up going up to like 33 or something."
"16389439","16392140"," You've got some, you've got support here right now. "
"16392160","16394740"," You're on, you're just coming above Vwap right now."
"16396099","16399000"," You can see that you've got buyers stepping in."
"16399140","16404680"," I'll put the, I'll put the add-ons on hero. "
"16408960","16414099"," And your first price target's going to be 3285 on Amazon."
"16414700","16416460"," And where's the real resistance on Amazon?"
"16416840","16417939"," I guess the big question, right?"
"16419980","16422980"," Is there real resistance on or where's the top on Amazon?"
"16422980","16424160"," I guess is the question."
"16425300","16427259"," Yeah, you're running up here. "
"16427360","16428860"," This is a lot of resistance above."
"16429520","16430900"," Maybe a nice sideways trade."
"16431439","16433779"," You could take it to 33284. "
"16434660","16436500"," You've got a bunch of sellers up here."
"16438020","16439840"," And that, that means much either."
"16440400","16443660"," You know that we can break through and smash through sellers on Amazon, whatever. "
"16444500","16447680"," Looks like your real seller is hiding out above at 3348."
"16463520","16464460"," Hey, thanks, Marcus."
"16464800","16465180"," How are you, brother?"
"16465180","16468640"," Yeah, look at IWM. "
"16469480","16471220"," How is your trading been going markets?"
"16473980","16476779"," So Amazon's on a potential double top as well."
"16479939","16482500"," Let me take a look here."
"16482660","16484180"," What did you guys want to type in IWM?"
"16487610","16489009"," Type in IWM. "
"16500310","16502470"," Type in IWM for you."
"16506619","16507820"," Hang tight, guys."
"16510040","16512119"," I've got a bazillion things going on here. "
"16531730","16533029"," Yeah, how are you doing markets?"
"16536480","16536840"," It's good."
"16537119","16537900"," What's going on?"
"16537939","16540560"," Market's saying Amazon potential double top two."
"16540700","16543840"," If it breaks, 3150, long, the longer timeframe. "
"16544300","16545759"," Nice bid and spoons coming in."
"16546380","16548540"," Great damn friend killing it."
"16549340","16550259"," We're doing great. "
"16550480","16559439"," We took the, we took the, or the spy, a short side when it sold down this morning."
"16560279","16562099"," I think Chase wound up doing banging."
"16562340","16563700"," I think he was short right off the gate. "
"16564380","16571180"," I didn't get in on the short on spy until, I don't know, 11 o'clock, 1130, 12 o'clock."
"16571300","16572480"," So we took that ride down."
"16572800","16573880"," We sold on the bounce. "
"16574759","16577400"," I took calls down at the bounce."
"16577700","16578460"," Some of us took calls."
"16578680","16580460"," A bunch of guys in here trading the banks. "
"16581800","16589300"," Some guys trading Qcom and a few other big tickers that have been doing well today as well."
"16589919","16590660"," So we're doing good."
"16591400","16594480"," As a matter of fact, I'm going to check my calls right now because I haven't checked them in a"
"16594480","16594740"," while. "
"16595500","16596200"," They're doing okay."
"16601279","16603460"," I'm up like 10% in calls right now."
"16603540","16606240"," They're not moving as much as I'd like to see them move for where we are. "
"16606740","16607520"," So what do you think, Mayhem?"
"16607840","16610599"," You think that we're going to burn the market off and to the close?"
"16610900","16611779"," Do you think we're going to trade up?"
"16611779","16618200"," We were talking earlier this morning about some numbers that need to be beat today."
"16618720","16620540"," We were talking about in the weekly, right?"
"16621119","16625680"," We were talking about that we closed or we made a new low today versus yesterday."
"16626259","16630080"," But we did not get as low as the Monday and Tuesday low. "
"16631000","16636939"," And we were talking about having to close at a certain number today to be bullish into tomorrow."
"16636939","16647099"," If we don't beat, if we don't have beaten like 47, 47, 1, 4, 3, or 47, 2, 9, 8,"
"16647259","16648740"," 6, maybe 47, 2, 8, 6."
"16649099","16652540"," We don't beat these today that it's not looking too good for the bulls."
"16654710","16656369"," Yeah, I think we're trading up as well. "
"16657830","16662970"," But it's going to be interesting into the close here if we can close higher on the day."
"16666990","16668950"," Yeah, this is a swing traders dream world."
"16671090","16672930"," Yeah, the reaction to the 30 year was good. "
"16679099","16681040"," We're starting to push up right now in the spy."
"16681560","16686259"," I mean, I bought the bottom down here because in my view, I'm like, yeah, they're going to at least"
"16686259","16691939"," try to close above 471, 473 would be better."
"16692619","16700599"," But if they don't close above at least 471, in my view, 471, 43, it's probably sideways in the"
"16700599","16700840"," Friday. "
"16701279","16708439"," I'd really like to see, of course, the bulls want to see us close above 473, right?"
"16708939","16710000"," 473 or so?"
"16710740","16712259"," The bulls really want to see that."
"16715580","16719860"," I'm in 475s, but that's because I'm trying to flip them for like 100%."
"16719860","16722080"," I want to see them close to like 30 or 40 cents. "
"16724810","16725970"," Yeah, Rotten E.S. could."
"16726689","16728290"," NQ's got banged up this morning."
"16728470","16731910"," We were watching all the puts come in on the Q's this morning. "
"16738470","16740550"," Who's the Russian guy?"
"16740710","16741189"," What's he saying?"
"16741830","16744169"," What's the Russian guy saying over there?"
"16746930","16748270"," Is that a legit follower?"
"16748570","16750529"," Is that just some rando that have to ban?"
"16751669","16753470"," Who's the guy down here with the Russian name?"
"16753890","16754250"," Is he cool?"
"16754830","16759529"," Say something in Russian that I can translate so that I can see if you understand me at least."
"16761810","16763869"," Yeah, Viacom's been a badass trade too."
"16769849","16771349"," Who's that Russian guy down there?"
"16771490","16772669"," Is he getting into the bend?"
"16773250","16774270"," This guy right here. "
"16776830","16777810"," It's a Russian bot."
"16778430","16778670"," Okay."
"16779170","16779790"," Give me a second. "
"16779950","16780870"," I'll try to ban his ass."
"16786300","16787360"," Give me two seconds."
"16787360","16788120"," I'm all over him. "
"16788820","16789760"," Ban hammer time."
"16791180","16799360"," There we go."
"16800460","16802420"," Where's that goddamn Russian bot at?"
"16802540","16803300"," What's up motherfucker?"
"16814890","16816090"," You're getting reported. "
"16817290","16823810"," You can report his ass for child abuse."
"16827050","16828710"," Bye bye, bot bitch."
"16831630","16832650"," Suck it mother Russia. "
"16839080","16840360"," All right."
"16840540","16841160"," So the bot's gone."
"16848370","16849010"," I'm terrible. "
"16849970","16850670"," I'm awful."
"16852490","16852890"," Okay."
"16852970","16854870"," So what are we looking at on IWM?"
"16856050","16859410"," The thing you got to know about IWM is similar to what markets in mayhem is saying. "
"16861230","16864230"," IWM could go up, but we know there's a pin on IWM."
"16864970","16868310"," Price target again though is 221, right?"
"16868850","16871430"," We know that it traded up to like 219 I think at some point."
"16871650","16873530"," So at any point it could trade up to 221. "
"16874110","16875610"," Call spreads maybe for a week out."
"16876170","16877270"," We do have OPEC's coming up."
"16877270","16879170"," Start to think about OPEC's. "
"16879910","16882010"," Again, you have to start adding in ERs."
"16882310","16886270"," We've got more or tomorrow we've got bank ERs."
"16887090","16889830"," And those have been trading up like wild all day long today. "
"16890030","16891410"," See traded up nice and high today."
"16895930","16897030"," You got caught short and spy."
"16899050","16900730"," Yeah, I got a bunch of the I got us. "
"16900970","16904250"," I got a whole rack of 475s for tomorrow."
"16905610","16906930"," And I don't mind Russians."
"16907310","16908270"," I like Russians actually. "
"16908270","16914670"," I was in the army and I was under a NATO flag in Bosnia and Serbia."
"16915390","16918850"," And so I know a bunch of Russia are, you know, like people with Russian heritage."
"16919070","16922330"," They're all good people, but the Russian bots can go and go get bent. "
"16926570","16929790"," Russians are kind of cool, but not Russian bots."
"16930470","16931790"," So if you're a Russian bot, beat it."
"16937370","16938110"," Hold on here. "
"16939150","16939650"," Yeah, 216."
"16941670","16943630"," The queues are kind of wonky right now."
"16943850","16947450"," There's, you know, there's like, let's ask markets in mayhem what he thinks. "
"16947850","16948550"," Is he still here?"
"16948570","16949910"," I have some questions for him if he's here."
"16954200","16960300"," Because I like how I like how the I like how the bond issue or the rates issue is being"
"16960300","16961180"," used right now."
"16961180","16963380"," No, no, I want to bring this up to something else that was important. "
"16965160","16974640"," They're using the bonds and the USSR. So the."
"16977060","16978760"," Yeah, look at Tesla right now. "
"16978760","16979720"," I thought we were looking at Tesla."
"16982320","16984120"," Hey, Mark, it's not a question for you."
"16984480","16988040"," Because that was some things I was thinking about and wanted to bounce off you at some point. "
"16988460","16990560"," And having a and having any freaking time."
"16991460","16993920"," Hey, you got some resistance above here on Tesla 1080."
"16994600","16996240"," You have some of the sellers coming down. "
"16996400","16998400"," The one good thing about this right here."
"16998400","16998960"," The one of the sellers here."
"17000160","17003840"," Is that there's more than they were before. "
"17004340","17005480"," So that's actually a positive."
"17005900","17008380"," More of these sellers that you drain here."
"17009080","17010620"," The chance the higher the chance they go up. "
"17010840","17014380"," There is expanded call range on Tesla as well, which is good to see."
"17014900","17017420"," We did see expanded call range on Tesla today."
"17017840","17021420"," And that is important to trade higher over time. "
"17022180","17023880"," So I'm going to give that side to the bulls."
"17025020","17030460"," I'll show you a 1200 and I have some questions for markets in mayhem because I haven't brought this"
"17030460","17031440"," up on the channel yet."
"17032220","17034160"," The first one was. "
"17035340","17036920"," The reaction to rates."
"17037240","17040460"," Yeah, see, so your call wall on Tesla has gone higher."
"17041660","17043360"," It's actually gone higher here. "
"17043520","17046060"," I want to show you guys that your call wall is higher now."
"17046260","17047400"," It was at 1200 yesterday."
"17047580","17048940"," It's now like 1250. "
"17050780","17052400"," It's like 1250 and 1300."
"17053160","17054520"," So anyways, we're going to get back."
"17054680","17057220"," We're going to get back to this market mayhem question. "
"17058340","17059260"," And I'm seeing."
"17061180","17065780"," I've it looks like I'm seeing, you know, like we have some we if we sell off slightly or whatever,"
"17065780","17071260"," you know, they're using the rates as an answer for the selling off."
"17071260","17074220"," But in reality, we're not seeing a reaction to the market. "
"17075460","17081880"," That we should be seeing like a sell off down to 450 or we just start rolling the entire market"
"17081880","17082100"," over."
"17082100","17087240"," So maybe it's just being used right now or it seems like currently it's just being used."
"17088160","17092200"," To dump the market or use as an excuse to dump the market at times, right?"
"17092740","17096220"," We'll use rates as positive news and negative news. "
"17097040","17099940"," Well, my next question is about tech, right?"
"17100140","17103580"," You see, we're seeing a bunch of TQQ puts come in."
"17104040","17108240"," See some weakness in tech, but the other thing that I noticed this past week."
"17108240","17111600"," Was the slow filtering in. "
"17112280","17115160"," Of the Senate hearings for tech."
"17115760","17121020"," For, you know, do we break or do we do we stop Facebook from taking over the metaverse?"
"17121280","17121540"," Do we?"
"17122140","17127340"," We don't like Amazon controlling them or they're controlling with a workforce."
"17128160","17131620"," We don't like this about Tesla. "
"17132040","17134520"," You're starting to hear those that those news stories."
"17134520","17137140"," So I'm always like, Hmm, sounds like."
"17137820","17142900"," They're just starting to gently roll off the tongue enough about negative news about tech that will"
"17142900","17148080"," start to hear what would be the negative news stories I guess about tech after earnings are done. "
"17166930","17169550"," Yeah, I'll buy calls and I won't even check on them, Winky."
"17169890","17172510"," I'll just buy them and come back or puts or whatever to come back."
"17183850","17187470"," Yeah, this is the target above 475 right here. "
"17188210","17190090"," This is your target here 475."
"17191250","17195450"," Your wall on the spy is, let's see if it's still up there at 480 or not."
"17197150","17199070"," We'll stretch this out a little bit. "
"17201450","17204030"," See if we can take a peek above and see if it's still up there."
"17204770","17207370"," So here is your absolute gamma strike right here."
"17209750","17213530"," And right about here, you're looking for a rejection off 475. "
"17215530","17217270"," That's where the target is right there."
"17218410","17220450"," And here's your absolute gamma wall at 480."
"17228630","17231390"," So I either see that tomorrow or Monday, I think. "
"17231530","17232030"," I hope we will."
"17232230","17232910"," We might not though."
"17233470","17234370"," We could sell down. "
"17237110","17240350"," So markets and ma'am saying regulatory pressure is certainly a factor."
"17240970","17244570"," The biggest factor behind you is rotational preference toward later cycle names for now."
"17246370","17251350"," As the presumption is we're in the expansion phase, rising rates, tightening, liquidity, economic"
"17251350","17251850"," growth. "
"17252770","17254050"," Yeah, we see that rotation."
"17254790","17256070"," I'm looking for that."
"17256250","17260670"," You know what I'm looking for is I'm looking for the building blocks. "
"17261390","17266830"," You know, it's like, well, if we can't short tech with just rates, do we bring up Senate hearings"
"17266830","17267230"," next?"
"17267770","17271370"," And we'll start building a story to dump tech."
"17272770","17277850"," Like what are the what are the stories that we should be looking for outside of just, I know the"
"17277850","17281910"," rate story, but I haven't seen the Senate story pop up until recently."
"17281910","17285470"," And I'm wondering now, what stories do we expect to be hit with?"
"17294260","17296260"," So AFRM is about to retest the low. "
"17296420","17297540"," We'll check AFRM next."
"17299360","17305520"," Because I agree with the sell off in tech, but I think that they need more ammunition."
"17306680","17308880"," And so I'm wondering what to look for in that ammunition. "
"17311520","17316020"," I haven't seen the Senate stuff in a, you know, they put the Senate stuff in the bottom drawer"
"17316020","17317180"," since last summer."
"17317760","17320600"," And then all of a sudden I'm seeing the Senate stuff come back out again."
"17321280","17323940"," Some of the hearings that keep hearing a whisper about as well. "
"17326240","17329080"," So when you want a reason to sell tech off, I want to be aware."
"17333830","17338830"," Yeah, so I have a it is possible to hop on with Discord."
"17339670","17341950"," I have not set it up as of yet. "
"17342030","17342730"," I was just off."
"17343030","17347750"," I was actually just off live setting up the final things in Discord."
"17347750","17351110"," I should have it up and running end of today at some point. "
"17351730","17353550"," So we can do live Discord chats."
"17354770","17356210"," Even with video if you like."
"17368980","17372600"," Yeah, the Discord voice I'll have up and running here today at some point. "
"17374820","17376440"," And I think I should have it up and running today."
"17376640","17378520"," And I've got Discord video as well."
"17379620","17382060"," It's kind of wonky, but it works. "
"17382180","17384080"," It's almost like you're playing a video game together."
"17386040","17388000"," So let's take a look at AFRM."
"17388700","17389740"," Winky's making a good point. "
"17389860","17394060"," Whoever made that point is coming into some general support here at 70 bucks."
"17397410","17399470"," Let's take a longer look at it."
"17402870","17404570"," And there's the golden ticket right there. "
"17406110","17407670"," 88 bucks and 82 cents."
"17409290","17410590"," And you are right on support."
"17417640","17419660"," Let me check on AFRM. "
"17419720","17419920"," Hold on."
"17420100","17421100"," Let me check on some stuff on it."
"17431940","17437160"," I'll check the flow on it and I'll check the. "
"17438080","17441120"," You've got earnings coming up right in the first week of February."
"17446180","17450840"," Man, you had a bunch of people locked into 90 C for the 14th of January."
"17451540","17455600"," My expectation would be that you burn off the 14. "
"17459300","17464580"," My thought process would be that they're going to kill the 90 C's for the 14th."
"17465200","17466600"," I would check on it."
"17466820","17467460"," I mean, I can't. "
"17467580","17469960"," I can't not a magician or anything, but."
"17471400","17480180"," If you look closely there on the 14th, there are 3,000 calls for two pennies at 90 C."
"17480940","17482080"," 3000 calls, right?"
"17482840","17483980"," They're not going to want to print those."
"17484680","17485500"," There's some. "
"17485780","17486300"," There's a pin."
"17488440","17489560"," On AFRM."
"17490240","17491180"," Or there was. "
"17491960","17493900"," Like a put pin on a FRM."
"17496360","17499300"," All the calls that are in the money are pretty fat right now."
"17500060","17503080"," It'd be neat to watch AFRM into the close of Friday. "
"17504700","17510200"," And see if the January 21st 90 C's go down."
"17511540","17513520"," They're like 37 cents right now."
"17514400","17519400"," If you get the 90 C's down to like 15 cents and make a run next week. "
"17520180","17523720"," Up to 90 bucks or even the chance of 90 bucks next week."
"17524260","17525260"," That's what I'd be looking for."
"17526320","17527420"," It's worth watching. "
"17528120","17531560"," If I see any call flow come in, I'll say something if I see any AFRM."
"17532440","17533080"," Call flow come in."
"17533160","17537600"," I'm sure it's getting ready between now and Friday to be ready to buy. "
"17542700","17544060"," Thanks, Joey for adding the."
"17545800","17547040"," Add in the calendar, brother."
"17547500","17548580"," I haven't called you yet. "
"17549040","17550300"," Yeah, we're getting a discord, guys."
"17550540","17551360"," It'll be done today."
"17555160","17556700"," No, no, no, the discords are free. "
"17558160","17559100"," Nothing's paid for here."
"17559220","17560840"," There's nothing hidden behind a paywall here."
"17561360","17561520"," Nothing. "
"17564960","17566300"," Yeah, I forgot that Monday."
"17566480","17567600"," I forgot that Monday's closed."
"17570200","17572400"," I forgot that we've got MLK today on Monday. "
"17576490","17578530"," I might be a nice ripper for spy too."
"17583080","17588540"," Yeah, we've got some slight spy puts coming in, but it's all dated for Friday."
"17600690","17601290"," Cheers, Joe. "
"17601650","17602310"," I'll give you a call, brother."
"17603570","17605030"," Yeah, I have to get the."
"17605550","17606970"," I have to look for. "
"17607950","17610690"," I have to look for or have to make."
"17610850","17615690"," I'm testing the I'm testing the discord right now so that when you guys enter it."
"17615690","17617510"," It's functional for you. "
"17617650","17618890"," It's got bots and stuff."
"17619070","17619930"," It's got a welcome screen."
"17620230","17622550"," It's got rules and all that kind of stuff. "
"17626140","17629980"," So I don't want to make it public so that you guys don't you guys are disappointed."
"17630200","17633380"," I want you guys to at least have a semi functioning discord."
"17635000","17636840"," Nothing's hidden behind a paywall with me ever. "
"17637540","17639820"," You'll never find something hidden behind a paywall."
"17641900","17643240"," Or at least not right now."
"17643500","17647780"," I'm not interested in anything paid any paid services right now. "
"17655620","17659660"," No, so I'll I'll I'll post the just to be clear."
"17659860","17659960"," Okay."
"17660600","17662420"," You're you'll have the live stream on YouTube. "
"17663220","17665020"," You'll have the live stream on discord."
"17667320","17669260"," There'll be a live update to the website."
"17670020","17675980"," What my issue is is that I want a place that everybody can go and find all the information in"
"17675980","17676440"," one place. "
"17677160","17677880"," So you're not jumping."
"17678440","17680460"," So you don't have to jump to the Twitter handle."
"17680460","17682900"," You don't have to jump to just the discord or just YouTube. "
"17683920","17685340"," I want to be able to say to you."
"17685460","17688660"," Hey, if you go to this website, you can find everything there."
"17689060","17694280"," One central location and you can dive into Captain's Alpha from there. "
"17694380","17699840"," You can dive into YouTube from there into classes from there into the discord from there."
"17699960","17702400"," I need to be able to, you know, show me a good point to me."
"17702420","17704680"," He said, you know, what if you got banned from Twitter tomorrow?"
"17705220","17708420"," You wouldn't have any way to direct people to this information. "
"17709340","17713040"," So he was like, make a central place that no one can take away from you."
"17713820","17716300"," And then there's never an issue, right?"
"17716440","17720960"," If someone new comes to the stream and they don't understand what we're doing here, we can direct"
"17720960","17722880"," them to simple classes, right?"
"17723040","17730720"," That explain how we trade, how we get ready for each day, how we do our due diligence, how we"
"17730720","17736720"," interpret the book map, how we use gamma and volatility, yada, yada, yada, all that other stuff."
"17739220","17740600"," Yeah, you will need an invitation. "
"17746600","17751200"," So, yeah, so if there's ever an issue, if there's ever an issue out there, you guys always be able"
"17751200","17753880"," to know where to go to find what you need."
"17754400","17759740"," There will be explainers there because I know some new people come in and they say, what are you"
"17759740","17760320"," guys doing here?"
"17760420","17760660"," I'm lost."
"17761260","17764560"," So I want to be able to have the ability for people to have one place to go check. "
"17765180","17767400"," It'll give people a route too, right?"
"17767660","17771460"," Like, first follow on at Captain's Alpha and go to this YouTube channel."
"17771720","17772680"," Here where the classes are."
"17773360","17774600"," Here's where the discord is. "
"17775380","17776560"," The sign up is free."
"17776960","17783300"," It's more, it has more to do with, like, directions for people."
"17784420","17786720"," You know, some people need directions, some don't. "
"17787500","17792260"," It's a place to store everything, too, if you're like, hey, how do I find this spreadsheet with"
"17792260","17792580"," earnings?"
"17792580","17795860"," How do I find the support and resistance levels?"
"17796200","17797520"," And it starts to automate that stuff."
"17798140","17800220"," So it just makes things easier, more clean."
"17801720","17803160"," Oh, the market is open on Monday. "
"17803980","17807320"," Let me, what day are we closed here?"
"17807980","17808700"," I got a look now."
"17808920","17810140"," You guys are making me paranoid."
"17812780","17813520"," I were closed. "
"17815340","17816120"," When are we closed?"
"17818920","17822200"," I were closed on Monday now."
"17824640","17825440"," Could be wrong."
"17826220","17826700"," Nope. "
"17827640","17828120"," Nope."
"17828420","17828740"," We're right."
"17829780","17830700"," We're closed on Monday. "
"17830820","17831620"," Don't make me panic here."
"17832340","17833320"," We're closed on Monday."
"17833500","17834300"," You guys are scaring me. "
"17835480","17837100"," The stock market is closed on Monday."
"17839760","17842800"," Yeah, don't be confusing me."
"17843060","17844680"," The market is closed on Monday. "
"17845980","17847460"," Just let's be clear on that."
"17850820","17852080"," You guys are killing me."
"17856060","17858220"," Yeah, we've got some weakness here in the spot. "
"17858520","17861140"," You've got dip by the dippers jumping in the same time."
"17861660","17868080"," Someone just bought May 20th, 219 IWM calls for $1 million."
"17869280","17877020"," So if this looks more to me like basing entry, I mean, someone just bought a million bucks in May"
"17877020","17879400"," 20th, IWM 219C. "
"17881720","17883740"," So this is all just day trader stuff."
"17883740","17885220"," All just boiler room stuff."
"17886900","17890000"," I'm not too concerned with where we wind up in the day today. "
"17897240","17907060"," Yeah, there's a channel for crypto"
"17907060","17907660"," coin."
"17907840","17910000"," So if you guys are into Bitcoin and crypto, there's a channel for that."
"17910460","17912000"," There's a channel for futures traders. "
"17912620","17922440"," There's a channel for what those futures, cash market options, stock investing,"
"17923420","17924700"," and crypto."
"17925360","17928960"," If you guys want a channel for anything else, just let me know and I'll put a channel in there"
"17928960","17929380"," for you."
"17929760","17934320"," If it gets too crowded or NFTs or some crazy like this. "
"17938440","17946780"," Yeah, golden tickets are, they print golden tickets pretty much print 70 to 90% of the time."
"17947120","17951140"," You have to time them correctly, make sure that you're entering at the right time, but they"
"17951140","17951780"," typically print."
"17958060","17964580"," Yeah, there's an IWM calls for if you guys, I'll do a video on golden tickets, how to trade them,"
"17964880","17970060"," how to position yourself in golden tickets, what to look for. "
"17970720","17973320"," So I'm not too concerned with this, all this action down here."
"17973680","17978060"," I'm really interested to see it looks like we get the buy program on right now."
"17978080","17980580"," I've got more buyers than sellers on the spy right now. "
"17980940","17983160"," Here are indicators picking up on the spy right now."
"17984220","17986720"," All this to me is just noise, just sideways trading."
"17994260","17999760"," Yeah, I've got some, I need some mods and an admin or two to help along with it. "
"17999980","18004580"," So if anybody wants to mod a channel, if anyone's a futures trader that wants to be a mod, it's"
"18004580","18006020"," not like you have to be there every day."
"18006180","18009200"," It's more like, it's not like you have to trade in that room every day."
"18009340","18015040"," But if anybody's slumming around and it's more to keep things clean and make sure that people"
"18015040","18016260"," aren't beating up on each other. "
"18016740","18019300"," And usually you don't have to be instant banning anybody."
"18019500","18022600"," You just on the side send a message and say, please be nice."
"18024000","18028500"," Discords is, it usually just takes a small email or a talk. "
"18029100","18030660"," Like, hey man, chill out or whatever."
"18031140","18033380"," And other than that, they can, they run pretty well."
"18037070","18038630"," Yeah, let me be clear here, okay?"
"18039870","18040750"," We are closed. "
"18041110","18046230"," The stock market is closed on Monday for MLK for the Martin Luther King holiday."
"18047210","18048210"," Super clear here."
"18048950","18050990"," Let's be super clear on Tesla as well, okay?"
"18052310","18058610"," Right now the support on Tesla is at 10.50. You've got some concentration of sellers above on Tesla"
"18058610","18059110"," right here. "
"18059990","18061690"," Your ultimate goal is 1,200."
"18061730","18065110"," You've expanded your call wall above to 1,250, which is nice to see."
"18065770","18067730"," Just got a nice sideways action day today. "
"18068670","18073570"," You know how we trade sideways and down until we get resolution, right?"
"18074170","18079530"," If you guys don't know about trading sideways and then down, sideways, sideways markets, they"
"18079530","18080150"," usually resolve."
"18080530","18085030"," If we don't get a resolution to the upside, we will get a resolution to the downside until we do"
"18085030","18085690"," find support."
"18089200","18090300"," Yeah, I like that trade. "
"18090460","18091800"," That's 73C for 121."
"18096360","18099620"," Yeah, I keep hearing people talking about gap filling and all that kind of stuff."
"18100900","18101940"," I'm not buying it. "
"18103780","18106580"," We're going to be heavy into ER season as we come into this week."
"18107060","18110020"," You're going to see really weird things going on with the indexes."
"18110820","18113800"," If I were you, if I was a trader, right?"
"18114080","18115740"," Well, I'm not a trader at this moment, but I'm with tonight. "
"18116380","18119400"," I'm going to take a look at the ER tickers that I'm interested in."
"18120780","18123380"," Just go through that spreadsheet, right?"
"18123820","18125480"," Delete anything you're not interested in."
"18125780","18128640"," Find yourself like five or 10 tickers. "
"18129660","18133340"," We'll find out where support and resistance are on those tickers."
"18134420","18136340"," And we can just trade those for ER."
"18136860","18138100"," We'll sell them before the dates. "
"18139140","18140180"," We can short, we can long."
"18141720","18144840"," What's going to end up happening with the indexes is typically our season."
"18146140","18147040"," Trade sideways. "
"18147700","18149620"," You have some big, big waiters."
"18150740","18153400"," We'll drop it the next day, raise it the next day."
"18168120","18170060"," Yeah, TPR. "
"18170320","18170860"," I'll put TPR."
"18171900","18174340"," If you guys want to, how about this real quick?"
"18180360","18183660"," Real quick, give me the ERs that you're interested in."
"18184100","18185020"," So I've got TPR. "
"18187950","18189410"," Maybe we can do those right now."
"18190550","18190990"," TPR."
"18191510","18198130"," How about we do like, don't be giving me these like, give me your favorite ones, not the tickers"
"18198130","18199210"," that you're upside down in. "
"18199350","18201030"," I don't care about your upside down tickers."
"18201410","18202870"," I don't care about the bags that you're holding."
"18203890","18204550"," Tell me. "
"18205690","18206910"," I don't care about Tesla."
"18207210","18207870"," We already know about Tesla."
"18208090","18209390"," We talk Tesla all day long. "
"18210030","18215710"," Give me like the ERs that you want me to quickly go through and find all their support and"
"18215710","18220170"," resistance levels out so that you guys can focus on individual tickers."
"18225620","18226500"," I've got TPR."
"18227260","18229960"," No, you know, you can't give me C, Andreas. "
"18230560","18232200"," C just ripped into clothes."
"18233340","18234080"," What are you talking about?"
"18234220","18234360"," C."
"18234760","18235860"," No, I'm not doing C."
"18236800","18238300"," I love you, Andreas."
"18239860","18241360"," C, or I'll do C."
"18241920","18242360"," I'll do C."
"18243500","18244160"," All right, what's next?"

"18342160","18343020"," That's another good one. "
"18344580","18346180"," You guys don't have to say too much."

"18393920","18393980"," Yeah. "
"18394120","18394600"," Look at that one."
"18396320","18397920"," C.O.F. Looks like a good one."
"18398520","18400820"," I want ones that nobody's playing. "
"18401720","18404340"," It's all Wall Street bag bag holders here."
"18404920","18407060"," I want seriously guys."
"18407720","18411120"," You guys want to be like, I'm going to talk to you guys about earning season real quick. "
"18411340","18412080"," Some of you guys know this."
"18412460","18417360"," Some of you guys don't."
"18417360","18418660"," J.N. Yeah, look at that one. "
"18418880","18423720"," What you guys want to be looking for out there is like, you guys want to take an hour at"
"18423720","18430660"," nighttime, write two hours, and you go through tickers that haven't been pumped yet that are having"
"18430660","18433460"," their ERs next month, a month after."
"18434280","18434920"," Prime examples."
"18436000","18441080"," Usually, I don't know if this one's doing it right now, but a prime example usually is five below. "
"18441860","18443520"," Five below will trade down."
"18444060","18448980"," And then like a month before their ER, it just starts effing ripping, like ripping."
"18449700","18450800"," It's like, you guys got to be fine. "
"18450880","18453940"," If you guys are going to play earning season, you don't want to be playing."
"18454360","18456440"," We already know that hood's going to 1360, right?"
"18456760","18457940"," You got someone asking me to do hood."
"18458680","18459520"," What can I tell you about hood?"
"18460480","18464580"," You are looking for $13.60. That's what you're looking for. "
"18466000","18469940"," And you want to see when that gets triggered, whether it's before ER after ER."
"18473660","18473920"," Yeah, hood."
"18475300","18476520"," You guys want to like it?"
"18477200","18480640"," Yeah, it will probably take three hours, but you don't want to be doing your bags. "
"18480900","18487100"," You want to be looking at ER players that have potential to either run or sell off."
"18487280","18493680"," If you're a bear, you want to be looking for tickers that are being driven up into ER so that"
"18493680","18494940"," they become a solid news, right?"
"18495540","18500980"," Let's say let's say a ticker is at 10 bucks and it trades all the way up to $30 and"
"18500980","18501940"," they have ER this week."
"18502660","18508480"," You guys think that a ticker run up, you know, 200% is going to go to about 400%"
"18508480","18509520"," over an ER. "
"18509780","18511340"," I doubt it, right?"
"18511540","18516960"," And then we'll end up talking about how to play ERs on their dates."
"18517660","18524880"," When you guys are trading ERs, if you're still ultra bullish on an ER, you can buy spreads that"
"18524880","18531240"," expire the next, you can buy spreads that expire the next expiration and you won't get murdered by"
"18531240","18533480"," the interest that falls off on tickers."
"18533720","18534540"," I have to do a video on that. "
"18538680","18539220"," I like URI."
"18539680","18540620"," That's a great trade too."
"18543370","18546710"," Somebody said Hertz MP. "
"18552080","18553960"," Yeah, it's like City's a good example of that."
"18554040","18555140"," It's like, let's look at Citibank."
"18555460","18556580"," Let's just look at Citibank. "
"18556920","18559180"," We have Citibank earnings today right after the Bell of Friday."
"18559900","18560720"," Let's look at Citibank."
"18562440","18567100"," So Citibank was trading as low as $57, right?"
"18567820","18571060"," Citibank's now trading 20% higher almost. "
"18571340","18575160"," It's at $68, trading at $68, right?"
"18575560","18578160"," We have its ER coming up, right?"
"18579300","18584720"," What's your expectation for Citibank heading into ER?"
"18585840","18590700"," Let's take a look."
"18591620","18592700"," Google Sheets."
"18594780","18596640"," We look at the Google Sheets for the ER. "
"18598140","18599220"," Let me go to Sheets real quick."
"18607440","18610360"," So we have their earnings is tomorrow, right?"
"18610720","18612360"," They've got earnings on the 14th."
"18613240","18613880"," A four market. "
"18614360","18618240"," So we're going to hear Citibank's earnings before market open."
"18620080","18627160"," Their estimate is 1.4%. Let's look at their ERs from previous."
"18627440","18630000"," Let me look at their ERs from previous dates. "
"18631620","18632340"," Hold on here."
"18641590","18643130"," But I can already tell you some stuff."
"18644350","18646790"," I can tell you that it's 2.34 in the afternoon. "
"18648590","18651410"," I can tell without even knowing right now, I can tell you right now."
"18655070","18655910"," Six months."
"18663110","18667090"," I can tell you right now, right, definitively, right now. "
"18668070","18674220"," I can tell you right now, right, that Citibank's going to sell off."
"18675540","18677080"," Citibank's, I don't care if it's a great earnings."
"18677480","18678540"," I don't care if it's an okay earnings. "
"18679980","18684360"," Citibank will sell off either today or the bell tomorrow, even with good earnings."
"18685260","18687260"," Let's say the earnings are out of this world."
"18687560","18689360"," We're making a hand of a fist money. "
"18690060","18690680"," We're going to expand."
"18691060","18691560"," We're going to do all this."
"18691700","18692780"," You'll still see it sell off. "
"18694220","18696440"," And then you'll see it come back up if earnings are any good."
"18696860","18699060"," If earnings aren't good, it's going to sell off."
"18699320","18700720"," If earnings are good, it's going to sell off. "
"18702120","18702900"," How's that sound?"
"18703140","18704060"," Because that's what's going to happen."
"18705840","18707800"," It's going to sell off today or tomorrow morning."
"18708620","18709500"," So how do you play that?"
"18710640","18711640"," I guess is the question, right?"
"18711760","18712580"," How do you play Citibank?"
"18712580","18720900"," I would play it with put spreads that expire in a week or, let's say, a month. "
"18722020","18724480"," You get some put spreads right at the bell today on Citibank."
"18725840","18727660"," Let's say it does rip higher after close."
"18728020","18728900"," It's still going to sell off. "
"18729180","18731500"," Profit takers are going to take profit within a week, right?"
"18732240","18733900"," Because we're going to move on to different tickers."
"18734180","18735480"," The shiny object is going to be gone."
"18736380","18737220"," It's not going to matter anymore. "
"18738920","18740080"," So put spreads, right?"
"18740080","18742060"," And let's say you're still bullish on Citibank."
"18742860","18749080"," I would be waiting for a dip this week at some point, or profit taking, and then buy the calls"
"18749080","18749480"," then."
"18750400","18750540"," You know?"
"18750940","18753640"," And we're just before the earnings are tomorrow. "
"18754240","18757660"," So you guys are going to know how to play earnings too."
"18757860","18758560"," Like where are we?"
"18758900","18759960"," Are there earnings this month?"
"18760540","18761060"," Are they next month?"
"18761380","18761780"," Are they in March?"
"18763880","18765880"," And then what's the expected?"
"18765880","18769700"," You got banks that are in Citibank right now since it was at $57."
"18770500","18771920"," Do you think they're going to risk?"
"18772440","18781560"," Do you think a bank's going to risk being invested in Citibank at $58 for you because you bought"
"18781560","18783100"," calls on the clothes today?"
"18784060","18784820"," I doubt that. "
"18785960","18787460"," I think they take the money and run."
"18795810","18797630"," Yeah, we're not quite ready to go live yet."
"18801360","18802960"," Full ports for next week. "
"18802960","18806660"," Yeah, you'll probably say a sell-off into the clothes on Citibank."
"18807340","18810860"," You might see another rip into the actual four o'clock hour."
"18811660","18813040"," So there could be a quick play in there. "
"18814620","18816560"," And let's say Citibank earnings are outstanding."
"18818220","18822560"," It'll blast off to the stratosphere and then it'll still sell off and come back down."
"18822720","18824720"," People take profit and they'll get out of Citibank. "
"18825080","18831760"," You're going to see the interest bleed out of Citibank calls and puts on both sides into tomorrow."
"18831760","18835620"," So what's your other, the only solution for that is spreads."
"18836500","18841520"," Like put spreads, even if they're dated a week away or two weeks away or whatever the next"
"18841520","18842900"," expiration cycle is. "
"18843860","18850220"," And then if the ER report is not good, then those put spreads will print anyways."
"18851540","18855280"," So maybe you wait until the last minute today, if there's another, if there's a sell-off and then a"
"18855280","18859360"," rip into clothes, scoop up some put spreads, date them like a week or a month out."
"18859360","18868040"," I guarantee regardless if it goes up, it'll more than likely sell off just by interest leaving and"
"18868040","18870720"," by profit taking. "
"18872200","18876320"," So we'll track coin into tomorrow and see what you think about coin."
"18876500","18879520"," Let's look at the coin chart for anyway that's bullish on coin."
"18887590","18888410"," Not coin. "
"18888410","18891750"," I said coin, I keep meaning Citibank."
"18892230","18895350"," Keep seeing somebody texting a coin to me."
"18896070","18896570"," I'm like, huh?"
"18899530","18900590"," Close that up. "
"18902650","18906710"," Let's do Citibank Group and see Citibank."
"18906750","18907270"," Citibank Group."
"18907830","18908950"," Keep saying Citibank too. "
"18911030","18912490"," Let's look at Citibank into the clothes."
"18919590","18920590"," This is going to be perfect."
"18921790","18924030"," We'll all check out Citibank Group into the clothes. "
"18924330","18925110"," Keep saying Citibank."
"18930410","18932790"," Let's look at Citibank Group into tomorrow."
"18935570","18938690"," There are prime candidate for how you play earnings. "
"18943030","18944670"," So here's the sneaky Pete's, right?"
"18945650","18947190"," Let's show you the sneaky Pete's."
"18948650","18957390"," So let's look right now, if you open up a chart on Citibank Group, you've got a break above, right?"
"18957750","18961710"," We know right now we've got sneaky Pete's sellers hiding out at 68, 46."
"18963010","18966190"," We have more sellers hiding above at 69 dollars. "
"18966930","18968470"," Let's see if we can go even higher."
"18970050","18970710"," Look at that."
"18970810","18972350"," You got sellers hiding above at 70. "
"18973350","18975550"," Sellers hiding above at 71, 50, right?"
"18975710","18977630"," You just got a steady supply of sellers."
"18978550","18980230"," So let's say we have a great ER."
"18981310","18982610"," Say we swoop up here, right?"
"18983750","18986230"," These are the same people that bought at $57. "
"18987430","18990890"," So they're going to be looking to feed into any great report."
"18991210","18996250"," So let's say we spike up in the overnight or between four and six, or excuse me, in the morning"
"18996250","18998950"," at four AM, we spike up to $71."
"19000670","19001250"," All right. "
"19001350","19002410"," Let's say we spike up to $71."
"19003970","19004970"," There you go."
"19005050","19005950"," These are all your sellers. "
"19006190","19007690"," They're just waiting above here at 70 bucks."
"19008510","19012430"," And they're going to sell it down into tomorrow morning."
"19012430","19013150"," That's what they're going to do. "
"19015290","19017170"," They're going to take their profit up here tomorrow."
"19018290","19018590"," Right?"
"19018810","19020390"," So this is what these sneaky Pete's are going to do."
"19020890","19021550"," Now, what does that mean?"
"19021670","19028830"," That means that you could come into the close today in the city group and get yourself some 70 P's"
"19028830","19037690"," that expire not this upcoming expiration, but the following expiration like 70 P and put spread. "
"19038410","19041830"," And more than likely you'll see people taking profit on Citibank."
"19041830","19047970"," This doesn't always work, but if you're going to play the overnight on Citibank or Citigroup or any"
"19047970","19053730"," ticker like this, you'd buy put spreads, you'd wait for the profit taking, take your money on those"
"19053730","19056990"," put spreads, and then you'd get back in and calls if the hour was good."
"19060560","19063300"," Then when it's by earnings, you load the day on spy. "
"19066560","19067380"," I never played IC."
"19067800","19068380"," Let's take a look at spy."
"19072850","19073250"," Yeah. "
"19073410","19074670"," So this is going to be negative for the spy."
"19074890","19075530"," Just a heads up here."
"19076430","19078030"," If we trade down this low. "
"19090600","19092740"," So if you're a bear, this is a good sign here."
"19092820","19099900"," If you're getting a new low of the day, getting into the close here, this is very bearish for the"
"19099900","19102060"," spy, which is good."
"19104060","19114840"," If you're a bear, I think"
"19114840","19116000"," we only have bank. "
"19116720","19119340"," I think we only have bank ERs tomorrow."
"19119520","19123220"," I don't think we have any other ERs tomorrow."
"19123220","19127040"," It's just like four medium-sized banks. "
"19130510","19132550"," You can grab a dip down here at this 465."
"19140590","19147490"," There's more Roblox puts coming in January 21st, ADP."
"19153510","19157650"," I'll let you know if I was going to update you if any more puts came in for, I think,"
"19157850","19159870"," AFRM and Roblox. "
"19160170","19164630"," There are Roblox puts coming in $216,000 and puts."
"19165830","19167330"," January 21st for Roblox."
"19169360","19173700"," I'll take a look at this list tonight too and see if I can find anything in here for their"
"19173700","19174320"," ERs. "
"19174700","19181120"," BA has some puts coming in, INTC has some puts coming in, AMC has puts coming in."
"19192000","19192560"," All right."
"19192780","19193820"," So I'll be back for three o'clock. "
"19194000","19198140"," I need a few more minutes and we're still working on this Discord right now, and I'll check back in"
"19198140","19198560"," with you guys."
"19205100","19210620"," Paul's short to 2118, 218, because I wanted more pain."
"19212780","19214040"," What's I WM doing?"
"19216720","19219100"," I saw those calls come in at 9WM. "
"19220720","19222680"," Did it give us a quick rip yet or no?"
"19223400","19224520"," There's a small rip at 9WM."
"19224920","19229060"," It was like a million dollars in a small cap calls coming in."
"19242350","19243910"," Yeah, I'm not too concerned right now. "
"19246230","19247330"," I'm just kind of hanging out."
"19247970","19251290"," I've got some spy calls for Friday expiry."
"19251870","19254270"," I'll hold on to those until they expire worthless. "
"19259720","19262740"," I should have sold them up here earlier, but I didn't bother to."
"19263180","19265520"," I wasn't really paying attention, but I'll hold them until tomorrow."
"19266920","19268800"," If they burn, I'll buy them again on Friday. "
"19316200","19340920"," Do, do,"
"19341760","19343440"," do, do, do, do, do."
"19361620","19364500"," Yeah, every bear is loaded up on spy puts right now."
"19364500","19373940"," There's 150,000 contracts on 470p. "
"19374200","19375980"," They're nice and fat and ripe right now."
"19377680","19382240"," From this morning on the bell, I think they were worth $1.50 or something."
"19383340","19389120"," I want to see if these continue to print or if the market makers take the money from these puts. "
"19389120","19400660"," There's too"
"19400660","19405120"," much risk on puts right now for the price of them."
"19427420","19430560"," I'll be back in 13 minutes."
"20056490","20064010"," Just want to step in right now and let you know that the bots sold there for 70p's on the"
"20064010","20066950"," spy for January 14th. "
"20066950","20076790"," They bought 151,470c's for expiring Friday."
"20077690","20085430"," Sold to close puts on the spy and bought 470c's for Friday at 73 cents."
"20134710","20142310"," I can tell because I leave open an options chain for the next expiry on the spy all day long. "
"20142310","20148450"," And it shows me when the all goes enter and exit trades."
"20151640","20153160"," Yeah, so they exited."
"20153980","20157340"," You can see the interest change. "
"20157800","20163160"," They were all in on 470p."
"20163560","20164480"," We talked about it earlier."
"20165080","20174460"," The 470p's were at $3.60, $3.70. They were all in on those puts and then they just sold. "
"20174880","20184220"," I don't know if they sold to retail or whatever, but they are now sitting on 470c for tomorrow."
"20185440","20188940"," That just happened like three minutes ago, 10 minutes ago, maybe."
"20190080","20191380"," I said three minutes ago. "
"20191560","20193000"," I don't know it was three or five minutes ago."
"20193600","20197900"," I had glanced over and I noticed the shift in the call side."
"20199980","20200820"," That they shifted. "
"20201300","20203900"," Sometimes they'll shift into straddles."
"20205000","20207000"," Sometimes they'll go call heavy."
"20207500","20209620"," Sometimes it doesn't print right away, but they're on them. "
"20210020","20211140"," I can tell you right now for sure."
"20211760","20212200"," They're on calls."
"20215980","20219360"," So I'm going to be looking probably to enter some of these 470s here in a minute. "
"20220680","20223800"," Then get them down to like 35 or 50 cents or whatever."
"20224420","20226340"," I'll jump on some of those 470s."
"20227620","20232190"," So I'll just stay with you now. "
"20232290","20232970"," It's already 3pm."
"20233870","20235170"," So we move this mic over."
"20239610","20240470"," It's wonky. "
"20240590","20244130"," I'm working on the discord and discord has changed this year."
"20244850","20248830"," The format of discord, unlike roles and permissions and all that kind of stuff."
"20260670","20263770"," Probably going to wind up playing some FTS into the clothes here. "
"20263770","20276440"," I am still"
"20276440","20278840"," watching this 465 down here."
"20279760","20287140"," It would be nice to buy calls again and more calls down here at 46513."
"20287780","20289120"," So we'll keep our eyes on this. "
"20290020","20293180"," You can see a buy program kicking in right now on the spy."
"20293920","20296400"," There's a lot of dark pool buying right now."
"20300350","20305060"," There was spy $608 million dark pool buy at 235. "
"20309360","20316500"," There was a city bank dark pool by at 230 for $21 million."
"20317440","20325400"," There was also a city bank by our city group by at 234 for $14 million."
"20326100","20328420"," At 6834. "
"20329200","20336960"," The spy by they bought $608 million was 1.3 million shares at 46736."
"20344030","20346750"," Seeing some excuse me."
"20352010","20360560"," Seeing some Ford puts coming in the door. "
"20362460","20368260"," Also seeing some puts coming in for spy January 14 for 69 puts."
"20369480","20371480"," For $350,000."
"20382040","20385420"," So I'm going to catch these four seventies are now down to 56 cents. "
"20386620","20390000"," So if I can grab some of these like 38 cents, I'll grab them."
"20405800","20407320"," Keep your eyes on that."
"20419420","20422700"," Keep your eyes on that 465 number. "
"20425780","20428440"," You want to see if these guys step up here for a buy."
"20494700","20496380"," Right here."
"20525470","20537190"," Mm"
"20546880","20565120"," hmm. "
"20619280","20625250"," Someone was asking about Marvel earlier."
"20626560","20629900"," I see Marvel puts January 21st."
"20630800","20634200"," 80 P for $120,000. "
"20634860","20639860"," Viacom calls 37 C for January 28."
"20642600","20648700"," Seeing some exp puts 182.5 for 18,000 bucks."
"20650500","20654320"," Tesla calls coming in January 14th, 1080 P."
"20655040","20656660"," Or excuse me, 1080 C."
"20659100","20666480"," There's some light puts coming in, but I'm not sure if this is more FOMO buy and tech. "
"20667260","20668340"," Some weakness in tech."
"20710210","20716070"," Yeah, I'm looking at these four seventies."
"20717050","20718050"," There's 150. "
"20724410","20726990"," There's a hundred and now there's 160,000."
"20727490","20729110"," They're at 52 cents."
"20729650","20731950"," Right now, 51 cents in those spy calls. "
"20732510","20736530"," I hope I want them to get down to like 38 cents, 32 cents."
"20736950","20741130"," If I can get them down to like 32 cents here, I'll pick them up."
"20744790","20749830"," I really want to see if you guys are looking on your screen. "
"20749830","20756730"," I don't know if I get it, but hopefully if we can sell off into the four o'clock hour,"
"20757110","20758450"," maybe we can tag this 465."
"20759150","20760170"," I can grab them down here."
"20760590","20761950"," Whatever the price of the calls become. "
"20817590","20819110"," What makes me bullish for tomorrow?"
"20820730","20824890"," I don't like I never like if you look at the chart for today."
"20825890","20830510"," The trade negative that the bearish trade was at the start of the day."
"20831130","20835470"," The bearish trade was again this afternoon at 11 o'clock. "
"20835650","20837810"," The next bearish trade was there."
"20838970","20843670"," I don't like taking bear trades or bull trades after the moves been made."
"20844230","20848630"," That's like asking me if I want to buy calls on a swing high. "
"20848910","20851090"," I don't want to buy calls at a swing high either."
"20851450","20855310"," That's like asking me every time I hit a top, do I want to buy calls?"
"20859430","20860530"," No, I don't want to buy calls."
"20861310","20866550"," At 473, I sold calls, so I really don't want to be buying calls. "
"20866970","20869530"," I don't want to be buying puts where we are right now."
"20870250","20874490"," What makes me so bullish is we've got buyers right here at 465."
"20875190","20876130"," So yeah, it makes me bullish. "
"20877730","20879370"," Could we sell off in the overnight?"
"20880090","20886070"," Maybe down to maybe some of you guys think we're selling down to, let's see, where's that big?"
"20886070","20890330"," That big line is down here at 454."
"20891010","20893410"," Maybe you guys think we're selling down to 454 tomorrow?"
"20894550","20895270"," I don't know."
"20897130","20899090"," There's no news to say we're going to do that. "
"20901150","20906250"," So I'm going to be looking for bounce off this 465 over here."
"20908750","20911690"," Hopefully we sell down into the bell and I can buy them down there."
"20911890","20912430"," They'll be cheap. "
"20912430","20920170"," I'd rather spend $0.20 on puts or like $0.50 on puts or $0.20 on calls than buying"
"20920170","20925750"," $4, $5 puts or war calls on the market."
"20927110","20929710"," I tend not to buy expensive stuff."
"20930170","20935170"," I prefer to buy stuff for like $0.20 and sell them for $4 or $5, $6, $7. "
"20936090","20945470"," If you start trading where you're buying calls at $5 or $6, and they don't print $20 or $30, you're"
"20945470","20946970"," eventually going to just lose all your money."
"20948290","20951530"," So I'm always trying to buy calls cheap and puts cheap."
"20952190","20955490"," There's this big thing out there people say they're expensive because they're worth something. "
"20956090","20956690"," That's not true."
"20957770","20962990"," You want to be buying your calls cheap buying your puts cheap and puts are too expensive right now."
"20963530","20964330"," They could print double. "
"20964730","20968990"," You could send a $4 put to $8 and that doesn't make any money."
"20970630","20972370"," So I'm always looking for something cheap."
"20972790","20975470"," I could play 20 cent calls, what?"
"20975990","20982850"," Five, 20 times and still beat a $4 put that prints 100%. "
"20984110","20985010"," Does that make sense?"
"20987070","20994470"," I could buy 20 cent puts 20 times and still beat a $5 call, right?"
"20997640","21000700"," So the trade, the trade's really over on the put side for me."
"21005500","21008980"," So I'll spend I'll buy 10 cent, 30 cent calls here."
"21009440","21014200"," I'll buy 30 cent calls down at $4.50. It doesn't matter where I buy them at. "
"21014340","21018880"," Wherever I buy them at, they're going to print better than a $4 put all day long."
"21022520","21023080"," All day long."
"21023260","21024460"," I can do that math for you all day long. "
"21028620","21031000"," So the trade now is to buy the dip."
"21032020","21036240"," Regardless of where it is, it could be at $4.65. It could be at $4.50. It doesn't really"
"21036240","21036520"," matter."
"21038760","21040320"," Because the trade doesn't print enough. "
"21044060","21046680"," Now I've still got the $4.75. I haven't sold them."
"21047880","21054140"," And I'm going to add some $4.70s here at $4.65. And then if we trade down to $4 "
"21054140","21055300",".50, I'll just load the boat."
"21064260","21066620"," I mean either dip buying or top selling, right?"
"21066940","21068380"," That's pretty much how you trade. "
"21069110","21071700"," I don't ever, I'm not ever, ever trying to be buying."
"21074140","21077220"," Never trying to jump on board to FOMO training in any direction."
"21098800","21103780"," Seeing some more, seeing some Nike puts coming in $402,000. "
"21104740","21107700"," Seeing tons of spy, dark bull buying."
"21108900","21118760"," See some Nike 414 145 P MSFT Microsoft January 14th, 302 P or 302.5 P."
"21120100","21123640"," Seeing lots of AMC all day long, not big money."
"21124660","21129340"," It was all like $25,000 P or excuse me, $25,000 in puts. "
"21129620","21138600"," But right now I'm seeing AMC January 21st, 23 P for $141,164,000."
"21140860","21148930"," Seeing some Apple call buying for February 18th, 185 C Etsy puts."
"21150770","21156990"," $367,000 in puts on Etsy January 28th, 162.5 P."
"21157930","21160950"," And still seeing more BAC puts coming in. "
"21161230","21163150"," Those have been coming in for the past hour or two."
"21163670","21168710"," These are January 28th, 48 P, $200,000."
"21189720","21193740"," Yeah, I'll buy like 20 cent puts or 50 cent earlier today about 50 cent puts. "
"21193900","21194740"," They're like 56 cents."
"21196140","21200980"," And I'll buy like, you know, I'll buy puts for 50 cents, 30 cents, 20 cents."
"21201400","21207120"," I can't stand buying puts or calls that cost me $4, $5, $3. "
"21207860","21210640"," Even like $2 to me is just too much money."
"21211680","21212240"," Is it going to trade?"
"21212380","21213960"," I can make that trade three or four times."
"21214840","21219360"," And it gets built into how many times do I need to be right, right?"
"21219360","21225560"," I only need to be what right one out of four times on a 20 cent or a 10 cent"
"21225560","21225920"," call. "
"21227280","21233100"," Versus if I'm loading up in, you know, if I buy, if I take, I don't know, you can do"
"21233100","21234520"," an arbitrary number."
"21235140","21240500"," If you're trading with $10,000, let's say you're trading account that you're trading with."
"21241040","21245940"," The 10% of your, let's say you have $100,000 in, you're trading with 10% and you've trained"
"21245940","21246540"," with 10 grand. "
"21248440","21256160"," If I'm buying the move that's already been made, we've already had a two day downward move, right?"
"21256460","21261100"," One, we topped out, let's say on Wednesday, we're five days here."
"21263100","21270740"," We wrote up from the 10th, wrote up again from the 11th to the 12th."
"21271280","21274280"," Now we've been trading sideways and down for two days. "
"21276450","21279670"," I'm going to be, I'm looking for the, I'm looking for a bottom here at some point."
"21280230","21283790"," It's either at four, if we break through 465, I'd buy some puts."
"21284930","21288170"," But until we break this 465, this is a dip buy. "
"21289690","21292910"," And they're dirt cheap, like 10 cents, 30 cents."
"21294150","21295910"," They can make that trade on 10 grand."
"21297310","21299310"," They can make that trade four times, right?"
"21299890","21302530"," Five times and print 400%. "
"21302530","21309850"," If I spend 10 grand right now on $4 puts and they burn, that's 10 grand gone, right?"
"21310150","21312150"," So now I've got 90 grand to trade with."
"21313910","21314890"," Does that make sense?"
"21318050","21325170"," It has more to do with the probability of success and the probability of printing."
"21343980","21347720"," Now I think if we break below 465, I think we're breaking down to 450. "
"21348540","21349960"," I didn't see anything."
"21350980","21352800"," I didn't see anything below 465."
"21353780","21356540"," Maybe something's come into play that I haven't seen. "
"21357300","21359500"," You can see here that all the support is at 465."
"21360360","21362560"," It was at 464 earlier today."
"21363240","21364460"," And it moved up to 465. "
"21366080","21369540"," And outside of that, your next stop is much lower."
"21371320","21372380"," Let's see if it's at 460."
"21373620","21384120"," It's a little bit of support here at 455, but the real support's down at 450, right?"
"21385040","21387320"," So 455, we've got a tag here. "
"21388000","21389900"," We've got real support down here at 450."
"21392220","21394080"," So you'll probably see a stop at 455."
"21395860","21399380"," And then it even here, it's not really that clear, right?"
"21399740","21401080"," See how unclear it is down here?"
"21403260","21404760"," Some buyers here at 464. "
"21409000","21411200"," So where do I want to buy calls or puts?"
"21411700","21413460"," I want to be buying calls down here."
"21424940","21427240"," I mean, that's like asking me if I want to buy calls at 480."
"21427800","21428040"," Fuck no. "
"21429040","21429720"," Fuck no."
"21430600","21432200"," Not until we're looking for 500."
"21434580","21436220"," But I'll buy all these dips down here. "
"21441440","21446220"," So we'll see as we head into the four o'clock hour, if we trade down to 465."
"21446220","21449860"," I'm hoping we tag 465 because they can get it even cheaper."
"21455980","21464200"," I might also look at some spreads, possibly, for, I want to say, third Wednesday or Friday of next"
"21464200","21467000"," week, or OpEx. "
"21470990","21472230"," But I haven't done much today."
"21472930","21475730"," I bought some puts earlier, made just over 100%."
"21476370","21480810"," I bought some calls, 475s, they cost me, I think, 15 cents. "
"21480810","21483790"," I think they're only worth, like, 30% now."
"21484550","21486030"," We're worth, like, $0.06 now."
"21486050","21487230"," I lost $0.09 on those. "
"21488750","21493570"," I'm looking for 470 seas in the high 30s, maybe."
"21497020","21500860"," Everyone's loaded the boat on those, so still have some faith in those."
"21501040","21503840"," There's some Tesla puts coming in right now as well. "
"21504320","21506440"," Tesla, February 4, 900p."
"21507600","21509240"," I haven't seen anything like that in a while."
"21509240","21519200"," And I see some Tesla, January 21, 100p. "
"21520920","21523000"," It's a text-looking week."
"21530100","21538180"," Some MSFT calls, Microsoft 305, January 14."
"21579720","21582620"," Yeah, I was listening to Brainard speak earlier. "
"21585300","21589160"," Yeah, I'll bring up IWM for if you want to see where the levels are for IWM."
"21592990","21597750"," This is actually, I don't know about you, but I'm a bull, so I like to see selling."
"21599670","21601430"," Selling is kind of where I live. "
"21602210","21606970"," I'm like a basement discount buyer, so I'm always looking for a deal."
"21607210","21609430"," And if I can get a deal here, I'll be happy to do it."
"21610910","21614150"," You guys want to see if there's, yeah, I don't see anything here on. "
"21618530","21621090"," Let's wait and see what pops up here in IWM."
"21622830","21626370"," I'm already looking for a bounce here off 465 on the spy."
"21653040","21654720"," Let's see if we can see anything here. "
"21659200","21661040"," Yeah, this all looks like basing to me."
"21662720","21664520"," Let's see if it sells down to 212."
"21666100","21669080"," I don't see, let me see if we can see a line on 212 down here. "
"21673790","21675470"," You can see all this ice right here."
"21675630","21676850"," All this ice is buyers."
"21677750","21678550"," See this ice right here?"
"21678710","21679290"," These are all buyers. "
"21684210","21685090"," On IWM."
"21690690","21692310"," I guess this would be the time."
"21692450","21694310"," If they could sell it down, it would be in the overnight. "
"21695030","21698250"," When you get into a low liquidity environment, it's easy to sell down."
"21698530","21701330"," Let's see if support right now and IWM right where it's at."
"21703900","21713680"," So the question is, sometimes in overnights when we have low liquidity,"
"21713680","21718000"," they'll drop it in the overnight because they can't do it in cash market. "
"21718000","21720300"," They do the same thing in going up as well."
"21720920","21726320"," So it is possible we could sell down in the overnight on the spy, or it looks like the buyers"
"21726320","21728820"," stepped right in right here on the spy end of the close."
"21729620","21734740"," So you could see us sell it down quickly into the overnight. "
"21735080","21735420"," It's possible."
"21743700","21746100"," So I guess in the chat, let me know if you're going to hold."
"21746100","21747440"," Are you holding?"
"21747440","21748300"," They didn't despair. "
"21748560","21749440"," The buyers stepped up."
"21749600","21750480"," You can see it right here."
"21751620","21753100"," The buyers moved up from 465. "
"21754080","21754620"," You got to see it?"
"21755900","21759260"," So the buyers came right in here and swooped up and they started buying."
"21760280","21762100"," So let me know into the bell."
"21762360","21764240"," Are you going to hold a short?"
"21765020","21767720"," So I guess I see some bears chatting in here. "
"21769300","21774520"," If you are a bear, let me know if you're holding puts or short overnight."
"21775040","21775740"," I want to know."
"21776300","21777540"," I'm going to write your names down. "
"21779800","21781800"," I want to know who's holding overnight."
"21784080","21785140"," Let me know right now."
"21785220","21787440"," Are you going to hold puts overnight?"
"21791610","21792330"," But there a lot. "
"21792430","21797590"," No, no, I want to know about puts for tomorrow because they went holding puts overnight."
"21812250","21812850"," Ryan's long."
"21817440","21828430"," Yeah, I want to know because it's possible"
"21828430","21829650"," they can sell it down in the overnight. "
"21830010","21835570"," That happens oftentimes in futures on the both ends, whether you're holding calls or puts."
"21840920","21842760"," Let's say they sold it down into the overnight."
"21847120","21853490"," Let's see right. "
"21853790","21853810"," 465."
"21868820","21871400"," Do you think we could bloodbath it down to like 450?"
"21874420","21878720"," Because the full, well, 455 peas are only 14 cents."
"21883960","21885040"," Those are dirt cheap. "
"21886420","21889380"," The 460 peas are only 46 cents."
"21889920","21892660"," There's not a lot of interest in those 46 cents."
"21893960","21896760"," It might make a nice, even it might make is a nice. "
"21899240","21904540"," And that's we just traded sideways into Friday, which would suck because you could take a straddle"
"21904540","21904780"," here."
"21906040","21913200"," 460p for like 45 cents and then pick up the 470c for 49 cents."
"21913360","21916360"," You'd have to print more than a dollar and be able to cut one side loose by morning. "
"21918200","21923040"," It'd be a total cost of like 87 cents."
"21927890","21930650"," If you could cash out whatever side's losing side."
"21932810","21935470"," My fear is, though, that we go into Friday, we don't move. "
"21936910","21938210"," Some Fridays, we don't move."
"21938370","21940410"," It's just they pin it on a Friday."
"21940690","21946070"," Then you lose both sides on a straddle for a big move tomorrow. "
"21968510","21970210"," Samuel's thinking they might gap it down to 460."
"21971250","21973590"," I think if they gap it down, they gap it down farther than 460."
"21974130","21975130"," I think they go down to like 455. "
"21976750","21977930"," I think there's a fair chance of that."
"21978530","21981150"," If they do a gap down, I don't think five points is that bad."
"21982910","21983870"," 50 points. "
"21984190","21988530"," It'd be nice to see it go like 100 fucking points overnight would be rad."
"21989490","21996090"," Because the real test down here is, well, we had the one bounce, two bounces, three bounces."
"21996850","21997390"," Yeah. "
"21998930","22000690"," We got a fourth bounce down here."
"22001530","22002710"," Find that hard to believe."
"22002950","22007190"," Maybe down to 455 is saying. "
"22007920","22010210"," I'd see it down to like 455 at least."
"22011980","22013950"," Gap it down to 455, then we rip."
"22030150","22031710"," Everybody's bearish right now. "
"22032190","22034090"," I'm seeing XLF."
"22034510","22036490"," Let me throw up and throw out some tickers to you."
"22037070","22041130"," XBI puts January 14, 97P. "
"22042530","22047730"," QQQ, 372 puts for 131 January 31st."
"22048350","22050620"," XLF puts January 31st."
"22051440","22051880"," 41P. "
"22053320","22053760"," BBBY."
"22054660","22056800"," January 14th, 15P."
"22058200","22063120"," More misfit puts, 285 for April 14th, 2022. "
"22063500","22067240"," Snap calls January 21st, 40C."
"22067540","22067960"," XLF."
"22068460","22072680"," Another XLF put January 28th, 41P. "
"22072960","22073060"," Yeah."
"22073160","22073880"," You know what that makes sense."
"22073880","22079360"," If you dumped XLF after the banks tomorrow, we might get a continued dump. "
"22082360","22085640"," Tesla, 1000P, January 21st."
"22086900","22088500"," Roblox, more puts coming in."
"22088960","22092780"," More puts coming in on Baba, Spy, Ford, XLE. "
"22092780","22098080"," More puts coming in January 28th, 61P."
"22098560","22100360"," That stuff all adds up to us gapping down tomorrow."
"22100360","22117950"," I wonder"
"22117950","22119350"," if we just trade sideways though. "
"22119530","22121430"," Close it out at 465 and you're done."
"22121970","22122730"," Thanks for playing."
"22123450","22124950"," We have that nice big swing down. "
"22125650","22126730"," Nice swing back up."
"22126850","22128790"," We have one swing back up, one swing back up."
"22129610","22131070"," Let's see if we can see anything else. "
"22134060","22135560"," When the bears are coming out, for sure."
"22139630","22142530"," So 460, 456, 455."
"22144050","22145130"," What's 455P's cost?"
"22152650","22153390"," I'll take that bet. "
"22154190","22155430"," I'll do a split now."
"22171960","22173740"," It's really far outside the money."
"22206020","22206880"," Yeah, I'm interested. "
"22207320","22208980"," I'm a dip buyer here."
"22209500","22212100"," I don't think that I care if we go up or down here."
"22212100","22214200"," I think that I'm a dip buyer. "
"22215500","22219820"," The way that it supports setting up here on the spy."
"22220240","22222460"," I think I'm a dip buyer at 465 here."
"22225270","22228410"," I think it doesn't matter if I dip by and lose today. "
"22229350","22232190"," I don't think it matters if I dip by tomorrow and Friday."
"22234290","22238350"," I think that either way, the selling doesn't continue."
"22238910","22240490"," I don't care if we go to 450 either. "
"22241090","22246110"," I think either way, I'm better off with the dip I am on the short side at this point."
"22249930","22251170"," I think it doesn't really matter."
"22257690","22263710"," Now I'm watching TQQ calls coming in January 14th for 150 grand. "
"22264230","22265330"," Apple calls coming in."
"22268350","22272450"," I could see some weakness overnight if the banks don't do well in their ERs."
"22272990","22275870"," If the banks do well in their ERs, we should do well. "
"22275870","22277070"," XLF should rip."
"22277930","22280670"," Then we'd be sideways in tomorrow, right?"
"22282110","22283950"," I think I'm a dip buyer here."
"22284030","22286810"," I don't think I'm down to get involved in calls and puts here. "
"22288010","22289530"," I don't like the cost of them."
"22290150","22291570"," I don't like the cheap ones."
"22291870","22293870"," We need a dump to 455. "
"22295270","22296670"," I think I'm a buyer here."
"22297330","22300470"," I think I'm a buyer tomorrow as well, even if we sell off."
"22303860","22305560"," I think that's where I am on the market. "
"22333660","22338020"," I think I buy 10 cent calls every day or 30 cent calls every day and still get a fatter"
"22338020","22338340"," print."
"22341170","22342430"," I'll wait for the bell here."
"22343070","22348170"," I'm going to buy some calls, more calls at the bell if we can trade down to 465. "
"22349570","22353550"," If they burn into tomorrow, I'll buy another round of calls tomorrow."
"22355900","22358520"," Then keep getting them at 10, 20, 30 cents."
"22362080","22365980"," I know that one of them is going to print like 2,000, 3,000 percent. "
"22399310","22400510"," So this is interesting."
"22401110","22410730"," So SQ was picked up by the banks at $87 roughly, $90 back in March"
"22410730","22413370"," and May of 2020."
"22413370","22421950"," And I just had an alert trigger for the second time on SQ at my buy the dip number of"
"22421950","22422230"," 137. "
"22424070","22425530"," I just triggered a buy."
"22428190","22431590"," So anywhere from my trigger, my first trigger was at 151."
"22432830","22434530"," My next trigger was wet 137. "
"22436730","22440930"," And I have a buy the dip number at $85 on SQ."
"22440930","22445190"," And I like seeing this capitulation in SQ."
"22446130","22452070"," I really want to see the last bit of the banks get out of SQ at like 90 bucks and"
"22452070","22454210"," then take a nice fat long in it. "
"22457750","22463730"," They just broke through at 136.86. When's their ER?"
"22465450","22466950"," When is SQ's ER?"
"22472140","22473920"," I've been waiting all year to buy SQ."
"22479480","22481880"," Anyone know what SQ's that ER date is?"
"22488840","22490120"," March 1st."
"22491080","22500210"," I'm probably going to buy some ER, some Tesla's tanking. "
"22500570","22501870"," I'll bring up Tesla for you next."
"22504190","22529930"," Yeah, there's Tesla puts rolling in fat Tesla puts SQ ER"
"22529930","22530270"," date."
"22539740","22543280"," February 22nd on SQ ER date. "
"22559960","22562860"," I want that last capitulation out of SQ bulls."
"22563860","22566540"," Just sell to 80 to 90 bucks for me."
"22567340","22570700"," Sell your sell your position in SQ now. "
"22573570","22573990"," There we go."
"22574070","22575690"," There's 46.08 on spy."
"22578140","22579480"," That's what I'm looking for here. "
"22579480","22580760"," I'm going to take a look at spy."
"22583180","22584240"," Let me see."
"22588400","22590420"," 38 cents on spy 470. "
"22592680","22593200"," Sweet."
"22599030","22600230"," Right where I wanted it."
"22600410","22603110"," The exact price I said, 38 cents. "
"22624190","22626690"," So the bogeyman comes out and you guys all get scared."
"22640420","22641380"," We get 464."
"22654170","22656590"," I'm going to keep my on SQ right now. "
"22656590","22659530"," I want to see if they could pitch late right into the close."
"22659950","22660650"," You know, I'm going to start."
"22660670","22662330"," You guys want to start watching SQ. "
"22662930","22667850"," It's almost sold off from all the way down from the March 2020 trade."
"22668930","22670330"," Two years, right?"
"22672150","22672450"," We are."
"22673590","22680510"," If it could sell off into their ER in February down to like $87, $90, something like that. "
"22680510","22684970"," It would have given back its entire run for two years."
"22686390","22687010"," Which is amazing."
"22698230","22700210"," I bought that tip at 465. "
"22701390","22704270"," About 38 cent calls for 70 expiring tomorrow."
"22713550","22715610"," And if we continue to sell off in a close, I'll keep buying."
"22721730","22723270"," Yeah, I don't care if it holds a dozen. "
"22736770","22737730"," Good job, Lincoln."
"22738010","22739490"," The 35 cent put our calls."
"22741610","22743430"," Yeah, they're worth, but they're worth paying for. "
"22745690","22746830"," And if they burn, they burn."
"22746990","22750650"," If they start selling off into the close, I'll cut them loose and buy them again at the bell or"
"22750650","22751370"," at 415."
"22752470","22753370"," It doesn't matter. "
"22756630","22757730"," I know how this goes."
"22757910","22759010"," We've been here too many times."
"22759470","22764670"," We come back in like three days or something and I hear something stupid like, Hey, your calls are"
"22764670","22765630"," now worth five bucks. "
"22767230","22768290"," Something's saying like that."
"22771460","22772820"," So I'll buy them now."
"22773040","22773720"," I'll buy them tomorrow. "
"22773860","22777400"," If we trade it down to like 460, 450, I'd buy them again."
"22782430","22786010"," Maybe I'll get like the 460s or the 455s at 10 cents or whatever."
"22794690","22796990"," And I give a shit less if they burn. "
"22798430","22804230"," I'd rather spend, I'd rather buy a dollar worth of calls three times than puts for four bucks."
"22806410","22807110"," One time."
"22817630","22819390"," I'm reading a discord right now. "
"22819750","22821270"," I'm reading a discord right now."
"22821350","22822830"," And you would look at what I'm reading right now."
"22822870","22823010"," Ready?"
"22823550","22824850"," This is what I'm reading in discord. "
"22825150","22826070"," I sold all my calls."
"22827030","22828130"," I'm holding puts."
"22831730","22834210"," I sold all my calls and I'm sold. "
"22834390","22835670"," So let me call them holding puts."
"22837670","22839490"," Sounds like it sounds like a."
"22840550","22844910"," It sounds like it sounds like they're both on the wrong side of the trade."
"22848170","22851010"," I sold all my calls and I'm holding all puts. "
"22852110","22852590"," Perfect."
"22871980","22873220"," That's all I ever want to hear."
"22873420","22875300"," I sold all my calls and I'm holding puts. "
"22892790","22894730"," Let's see if we can get a little bit of."
"22900090","22903530"," Got some buyers down here begging for four sixty four."
"22924010","22929090"," Can you imagine selling all your calls at four sixty five right where we are right now?"
"22930370","22933990"," Can you imagine buying puts right here at four sixty five?"
"22934150","22934650"," I can't. "
"22964750","22968870"," That's like saying I had SQ calls from two years ago and I just sold them."
"22971750","22972870"," Too funny."
"22976060","22976680"," I held SQ. "
"22976960","22979300"," I bought SQ back in 2020 and March 2020."
"22979300","22980220"," I just sold them."
"22981020","22982320"," My SQ shares. "
"22994590","22997630"," Man, if I saw SQ at 80 bucks or 90 bucks, I'm balls deep."
"22997850","22998310"," I'm all in."
"23017270","23043490"," Yeah, I've"
"23043490","23046370"," been waiting for SQ to bottom out. "
"23046470","23047550"," I've been waiting for most of these."
"23048210","23051050"," I've got a whole bunch of tickers that I'm looking at to buy."
"23051710","23054290"," And I think that I'll get that capitulation by March. "
"23055110","23060750"," I'm hoping that I get all of these stocks that were the 2020 trade they've been selling off for a"
"23060750","23061290"," whole year."
"23065060","23070120"," I got a list of stocks that I want to buy and they're still not down to the prices that"
"23070120","23070740"," I want them at."
"23071320","23074700"," But I'm having these tickers are all triggering right now. "
"23074720","23079900"," I'm getting a bunch of email alerts on tickers that are getting close to where I want to buy them."
"23095420","23096180"," Real close."
"23097920","23099560"," So we're almost at that point. "
"23100780","23107640"," You figure as we get closer to March, we'll start to see some real good buying opportunities in the"
"23107640","23108020"," market."
"23118410","23119690"," There's that Tesla feed."
"23119990","23124770"," I want to look at HUD real quick and see if the $13 is still available on HUD. "
"23125530","23128470"," I want to buy HUD at $13.60, I think."
"23135130","23138430"," I want like the very last hood sellers to sell out."
"23142990","23147610"," You know, an SQ sold down once to $133 a few days ago. "
"23148410","23151350"," And it was a nice buy, but I still think it's going down."
"23151490","23154090"," I don't think it's done until it hits 90 bucks or so."
"23155230","23157210"," I don't think I'm going to get that until March. "
"23173430","23174670"," There's the Tesla feed."
"23175350","23178850"," Let's see if the buyers are still down here on HUD at 13 buck."
"23179130","23180470"," I think it was 1360. "
"23184750","23186650"," It's like 1360, like right here."
"23187410","23188630"," This is what you're waiting for in HUD."
"23189150","23195320"," You're waiting for $13.60. That's when you want to buy HUD. "
"23195980","23199600"," Look at SQ next and see where the real banks are and SQ."
"23199860","23200260"," Let's take a look."
"23200420","23201420"," That's a good question to ask. "
"23202000","23203900"," Let's look at SQ and see where the real buyers are."
"23210210","23210570"," SQ."
"23223140","23225060"," Probably down at that $90 mark. "
"23226220","23231330"," Get some support at 130."
"23232590","23235550"," What I really want to see is that the banks are getting down at 90 bucks."
"23241740","23243840"," So I want to show you where the real buyers are. "
"23251770","23253190"," Let's see the way down here."
"23256250","23256690"," $114."
"23259370","23261050"," I would mark that in your calendar. "
"23267000","23267760"," No, it's 130."
"23268480","23270780"," It's good support here on SQ actually."
"23273080","23274040"," It's not bad support. "
"23277170","23278270"," Let's see it right here."
"23279010","23279350"," Oh, no."
"23279630","23280170"," Hold on a second. "
"23281230","23283290"," $130 is where the buyers are on SQ."
"23284910","23285630"," $130 bucks."
"23286630","23287150"," All right. "
"23287250","23287610"," Let's take a look."
"23287750","23290510"," I'm going to buy some calls here."
"23302660","23303220"," Hold on. "
"23303320","23303700"," Wait for me."
"23329410","23331830"," Added some more to the 470 position."
"23345190","23347990"," I'm going to buy some spy spreads as well here. "
"23348430","23363150"," Some call spreads January 4th."
"23367940","23370200"," Where am I looking for for these call spreads?"
"23379960","23389530"," I'm going to add some call spreads right now to spy in the money call spreads."
"23421030","23422270"," Add some more. "
"23422750","23425550"," Add some more 470s."
"23427070","23430550"," So I've got a bunch of racks of 470 C for tomorrow."
"23431470","23434910"," I've got still holding some 475s. "
"23434950","23435590"," I'm not going to sell those."
"23435730","23436690"," I'm just going to leave them if they burn."
"23436850","23437110"," They burn. "
"23449950","23451630"," And SQ is 130."
"23452230","23452770"," That's you want to wait."
"23453050","23458430"," If you're in puts on SQ, you still get another 70 points. "
"23458650","23459370"," You can get off SQ."
"23459370","23459630"," Thank you."
"23460970","23462050"," Tech Tesla. "
"23472090","23474430"," Tesla that $1,000 mark down here."
"23479220","23480520"," Let's go to spy real quick."
"23597490","23598890"," Seeing some more. "
"23599630","23600490"," What do I see now?"
"23601070","23605410"," Pound tier puts 17 P for January 14th."
"23605410","23609010"," IWM some puts January 14th."
"23609750","23610730"," All single date puts. "
"23611450","23614250"," 216 P and video 250 P."
"23614470","23616150"," Those are expiring on the 21st."
"23616350","23619350"," And more Marvel puts January 21st."
"23619510","23624890"," 80 P TQQ. "
"23625510","23626110"," Golden."
"23626290","23630490"," Not a golden ticket, but a high algo score January 21st."
"23631170","23633030"," 63.75 calls. "
"23633690","23635050"," $400,000."
"23675750","23676810"," There we go."
"23676870","23678190"," There's that nice sexy bounce. "
"23709550","23712310"," So let's see what's my average cost on."
"23712310","23715610"," My 40 cents."
"23715750","23716710"," I bought a ton of Ford. "
"23716830","23717090"," I bought."
"23717550","23720230"," Not about seven."
"23720890","23722070"," Oh, four seventies. "
"23723670","23725050"," About four seventy."
"23726890","23729970"," Or January 14 for 70 C's."
"23730650","23732170"," I don't know how much I'm in on them for. "
"23732670","23736430"," I think I've averaged down to like 27 cents or something, 28 cents."
"23754400","23755700"," Yeah, it was a good day today."
"23756840","23764600"," I think Tyler might be buying some more here. "
"23772470","23775150"," Yeah, I loaded the fucking boat on calls here at the bell."
"23788490","23789210"," Let me see."
"23789270","23790950"," I'm break even now on my four seven. "
"23791130","23791150"," Nope."
"23791350","23791970"," I'm up now."
"23791990","23792950"," I'm green on my calls. "
"23794570","23797050"," So I guess I'm in my average price."
"23797050","23801750"," Cost price is 28 cents on four seventy C expiring tomorrow."
"23802890","23805870"," That's my average buy in when I was when I was all said and done. "
"23816430","23822530"," I think I started at 38 cents on the calls and then averaged down until in the twenties."
"23823250","23824670"," Now I'm at 28 cents."
"23824910","23825750"," I'm green right now. "
"23826390","23830210"," My other calls earlier are at five cents."
"23830410","23833170"," I think I started those at 15 cents."
"23833870","23835330"," I don't remember what I bought those at. "
"23835550","23836210"," I'll have to check those."
"23837150","23838690"," They may have cost me more."
"23839210","23840490"," It may have cost me like the thirties. "
"23840610","23840990"," I'm not sure."
"23841470","23842010"," I'll have to look at those."
"23842470","23844010"," I think they cost 15 cents. "
"23844670","23848550"," And my average price on four seventy C's are twenty eight cents."
"23855900","23861520"," Yeah, I like the January 18th, but I don't like all the I don't like the three days off."
"23862080","23864640"," So I bought some spreads on spy as well. "
"23865420","23869160"," I didn't like the I didn't like the price of."
"23869760","23873440"," I didn't like the I don't like I don't want to buy any calls past Friday."
"23874580","23876480"," Because of the theta burn over the weekend. "
"23877860","23879040"," Yeah, you guys have a great day."
"23881220","23881900"," Yeah, I know."
"23882020","23883460"," We just tried qcom every day. "
"23887820","23889820"," I didn't even think about qcom."
"23889980","23892240"," I was watching hood and I was watching sq."
"23897280","23901400"," There were some docu sign if there's any calls or puts the comment after the bell. "
"23901400","23903500"," I'll stay on with you guys for the next 15 minutes."
"23903500","23912970"," Just to see if any more puts or calls come in the next 15 minutes here."
"23913550","23914450"," Yeah, you're welcome everybody. "
"23914610","23915610"," Hope everybody had a great day today."
"23917570","23917930"," Qcom."
"23918090","23919090"," We should look at that qcom. "
"23919210","23920070"," Did it really go that low?"
"23927230","23927830"," Yeah, I'll check."
"23927990","23928890"," You guys are my check tickers."
"23928990","23930910"," I can be ZFD. "
"23931210","23933010"," What's the problem is that after the bell."
"23934070","23935190"," It's hard to find."
"23937190","23938410"," Let me check the Tesla feed. "
"23939930","23942470"," It's hard to see what's going on after the bell."
"23943250","23943710"," BZFD."
"23946730","23947650"," What's BZFD?"
"23947990","23948330"," Buzzfeed. "
"23948730","23950430"," I didn't know Buzzfeed had a stock."
"23951750","23953170"," I didn't even know that."
"23957090","23958490"," Yeah, it's not going to show much. "
"23959670","23960130"," Maybe."
"23965280","23967480"," Yeah, it's not really showing much on Buzzfeed."
"23974240","23975440"," Like I've never heard of it. "
"23978620","23980400"," Tesla can't say much on either."
"23980700","23982520"," Same that same by the dippers are down here."
"23982620","23984160"," One thousand one fifty. "
"23984380","23985660"," They just tore through this afternoon."
"23986400","23988220"," 1035 looked like right into the bell."
"23988360","23994800"," It was contentious, but I did buy that close today. "
"23999760","24001280"," So we'll see what happens here."
"24002640","24003880"," Yeah, what's BZFD?"
"24005320","24005600"," Oh, check."
"24005940","24006900"," Just check the range. "
"24007220","24007400"," Hold on."
"24007480","24007880"," I'll check it."
"24008840","24009280"," BZFD. "
"24011120","24011740"," Let's see."
"24018930","24020650"," The range on BZFD."
"24020890","24022790"," It looks like buyers are at three ninety eight. "
"24024210","24028470"," If you had a sell, if you wanted to get out of your position, I would sell it three eighty"
"24028470","24028710"," eight."
"24029770","24036370"," And then you've got more buyers than sellers here, wherever you are, four thirty nine."
"24037290","24037970"," But it does. "
"24038130","24041590"," It looks like your ceiling's at four ninety two and five thirty nine."
"24041590","24047990"," And your price target on Buzzfeed is eight nine eight seventy nine."
"24050050","24059590"," You have more sellers above at twelve eighty nine and thirteen fifty four on BZFD. "
"24061410","24062610"," I didn't mean to make fun of it either."
"24062610","24064530"," I just didn't know that Buzzfeed had."
"24068230","24075590"," Yeah, XPI had calls come in and then it had lots of puts coming in at the end of the"
"24075590","24075850"," day. "
"24077990","24079750"," So I don't know what to say to you on XPI."
"24080890","24082590"," XPI was trading really well."
"24092730","24097510"," It's literally touched my by the fucking dip today. "
"24100290","24101770"," XPI touched it right at the bell."
"24106030","24108610"," Maybe that was the buy at the bell today was XPI."
"24111470","24115370"," I've got it charted out with BTFD written right where it closed today. "
"24116790","24121830"," So all these tickers are all these ETFs and tickers are coming down to a pretty fair price."
"24123690","24125030"," Stuff's getting cheap again."
"24133140","24136120"," Yeah, I don't know how you could be bearish here looking at looking at Amazon. "
"24136680","24139880"," I like Amazon right where it's at even like Amazon today at the close."
"24141980","24146400"," I would like to have bought Amazon at the close today."
"24146940","24156930"," I like Amazon a lot"
"24156930","24157210"," here. "
"24165420","24168920"," No, I don't I don't care about head and shoulder patterns."
"24170100","24171540"," I care less."
"24172080","24174840"," Only thing I care about is our options cheaper expensive. "
"24175840","24178860"," To be honest with you, I only care about price time."
"24179920","24184780"," I care about other buyers showing up or they so just so you guys know after the bell."
"24185600","24191840"," Or just before after the bell, we saw a half million dollar trade come in for TQQ calls for January"
"24191840","24193060"," 21st. "
"24193580","24201900"," And then right now after the bell, more TQQ calls 71.5 C January"
"24201900","24205840"," 14th for a couple hundred thousand dollars."
"24205840","24207860"," This is after after the bell rang."
"24212930","24213670"," Just heads up. "
"24214750","24217530"," Yeah, Amazon that's at the very bottom of its channel."
"24217850","24219790"," There are some good buys here at the bell today."
"24219790","24223930"," Either today, tomorrow, next day, there's going to be some decent buying going on. "
"24225410","24227390"," So I bought the dip here into the bell."
"24227990","24228890"," I think it's worth it."
"24230210","24231750"," We know how this plays out. "
"24233830","24235370"," I already know how this plays out."
"24235950","24239010"," This always plays out where I make like giant money."
"24241850","24243450"," This only plays out one way. "
"24245910","24255470"," The 10 year was down all day at the stock market was telling us on its way to 2%"
"24255470","24257390"," bastards."
"24259670","24263690"," Yeah, I think this I think for me, my sell the market."
"24263910","24265430"," I keep watching TLT. "
"24266610","24272210"," And I'm not willing to sell tech until it gets to like one until it gets to like one 72."
"24273590","24274630"," That's what I'll sell tech."
"24276670","24278790"," 1.72 or so somewhere in there. "
"24283670","24286730"," I think that's kind of like the sell the market shit."
"24287530","24290810"," And TLT curled up all day long today, which was the under hint."
"24290930","24293470"," It was the hint that tech should sell off today. "
"24296820","24300020"," But in all honesty, you're looking for like, do you want real ugliness?"
"24301480","24304520"," Probably one one 72 somewhere up in there."
"24305280","24308860"," You start breaking above that 170 like you get to 180 185."
"24309640","24310660"," You'll get real nasty. "
"24312560","24316760"," That was when we had the crash back in 2020, right?"
"24317000","24319260"," 2020 we hit like 170s, 180s."
"24319780","24321360"," And that's where it got really, really ugly."
"24324300","24327280"," So I'm playing the I'm going to play the. "
"24330280","24335680"," You see here and TLT has a little bit more to go."
"24335680","24337580"," TLT could go up to 146."
"24340790","24343210"," Before it gets rejected again, like 146. "
"24343850","24345190"," You might have another down day tomorrow."
"24346070","24347070"," I don't think it really matters."
"24352170","24353650"," We could sell off some more tonight. "
"24355070","24356290"," But I don't think it matters."
"24356470","24358230"," I think what matters most is buying."
"24358790","24362250"," I think just buying these dips and selling these rips is where all the money is at. "
"24377150","24380830"," Oh, yeah, you need to see like if you want to say if you're going to if we have a"
"24380830","24386910"," market crash, you want to see TLT at like 170 180 190 somewhere in there."
"24387570","24389350"," And you know, you're in a market crash as to a situation."
"24392260","24394540"," Yeah, you can't really I can't really get bearish. "
"24394980","24396280"," I can't get bullish either."
"24396280","24397340"," I'm not bullish in the market."
"24397460","24399980"," I don't think we're going to 500 or anything or even 480. "
"24401040","24403120"," It'd be a it'd be a gift if we went to 480."
"24406490","24408410"," But I what I do think is."
"24409690","24413070"," Yeah, there's a bunch of spy calls coming in after the bell to just heads up. "
"24422240","24427260"," So we'll see if it's if it's if we sell off to 450, I'd be happy guy to at 450."
"24428860","24431380"," I don't think it matters as much where we sell off to."
"24431780","24435000"," I think it matters how much you're paying for your shit and how much you sell them for. "
"24445350","24446070"," Now I'm fine."
"24446230","24447490"," I'll sleep the night just fine tonight."
"24449730","24453310"," I when you know what I don't sleep is when I buy the tops or bottoms. "
"24453310","24457290"," Well, if I'm buying put like if I bought puts tonight into the bell, I would be scared."
"24458770","24467270"," I did see some spy puts come out February 18th or 44 P for $2.5 million."
"24468770","24471770"," And January or February 18th. "
"24472550","24474010"," These came out after the bell."
"24474370","24476590"," So I saw some hedges bought, right?"
"24477560","24490540"," February 18th, 444 puts for $7.6 million, $7.6"
"24490540","24494020"," million at the bell, 444 P."
"24503620","24507120"," So Adam's looking for you know, Adam."
"24507320","24512240"," You know what I never like on Tesla ER is I always like to buy after the ER. "
"24514400","24516760"," I always like buying Tesla after ER."
"24517100","24520300"," I have a price target of where I want to buy it by Tesla."
"24521020","24523000"," The problem is that the interest goes away. "
"24529950","24534330"," If you want to buy a Tesla run though on ER."
"24541740","24545880"," Wait for tomorrow and buy in the money call spreads."
"24548670","24551840"," If we had a swing down on Tesla like 900. "
"24552700","24554560"," I'd buy that dip all day long."
"24555200","24557120"," Give me like 900 bucks on Tesla."
"24557120","24557920"," I'd buy that dip. "
"24560300","24561420"," Yeah, I'm in a trade."
"24562140","24568440"," I bought so I started today with spy puts and then I switched to spy calls."
"24568740","24571720"," Spy puts printed spy calls didn't print. "
"24572300","24576200"," I'm still holding those and then I bought the clothes for calls."
"24583290","24584670"," And we just had another."
"24585150","24587910"," Just so you guys before I close this stream up. "
"24588050","24589410"," It's 413 right now."
"24589690","24591670"," We just had another hedge come in."
"24591930","24593470"," So we have three hedges on the spy. "
"24594170","24598250"," 444 P for we had one for $5.1 million."
"24599150","24606030"," We have a second one for $2.5 million and a third one for $1.1 million."
"24607890","24609010"," 444 P."
"24609450","24611470"," I don't know these look like hedges. "
"24612130","24616090"," They could be a bank trying to cash in on a sell the market tomorrow."
"24617070","24619810"," So someone's all in on us crashing overnight."
"24619810","24622290"," You've got one more minute left until we close. "
"24665240","24669980"," We bought or we've got we've got hedging coming in right to the last minute here."
"24669980","24672220"," A whole ton of it on the spy."
"24672440","24674220"," We have another one right now that just came in. "
"24674220","24683580"," It's January 14 for 62 puts at $1.11 January 14 for 62 puts."
"24683960","24689620"," Those are expiring tomorrow for $105,000 for 62 P."
"24690420","24693430"," expiring tomorrow for $105,000."
"24694340","24698040"," We have lots of spy puts rolling in last minute of the day. "
"24708370","24712410"," I can tell their hedges because of the the the amount of money they are."
"24712410","24717330"," When you start trading like $10 million calls or $10 million in puts."
"24718070","24722390"," Those are usually hedges and it's usually when they're buying them that matters as well. "
"24722970","24725490"," If you see them buying them when we're at a top or at a bottom."
"24726210","24731110"," You'll end up seeing like let's say we you know a good way to track if a stock is done"
"24731110","24731750"," on its run."
"24732130","24739810"," Let's say Apple starts at $100 and it makes a run from $100 to $110 right. "
"24740550","24743370"," You'll see a call structure coming in."
"24743810","24748030"," That's like $100,000, $300,000, $500,000."
"24749250","24751910"," And then as it gets to that 110 number. "
"24752710","24758210"," You'll see like $10 million in Apple calls dated three months away."
"24759290","24761790"," And you'll notice that that's that's almost like a hedge right."
"24762430","24764330"," The same thing on the same side of them on the spy. "
"24765790","24771770"," These could be triggers from long only hedge funds where they trigger in their charter to buy puts"
"24771770","24772750"," at a certain level."
"24773950","24775890"," They're forced into buying these things."
"24776550","24780150"," Some people are buying them because they actually think we're going to four forty four. "
"24780830","24784250"," In September right that we're going to trade down the market to four forty four."
"24788170","24789950"," And it's the signature on them as well."
"24789950","24795770"," So after the bell. "
"24797250","24802390"," Lots of spy hedging four forty four P February 18th."
"24805170","24806710"," All right, I'll check out you guys tomorrow."
"24811010","24814770"," I'm surprised if the market wanted a severe downturn that it wasn't more deliberate today. "
"24814910","24817410"," We've seen far worse since today moves recently that it can go deeper."
"24817830","24819170"," That can't be bullish."
"24819710","24821950"," Yeah, they're it's weird. "
"24822870","24826510"," You've got people that are forced into buying hedges at certain triggers."
"24828070","24830150"," You saw massive."
"24831010","24834690"," So it's weird when you see when you see high volume days. "
"24835930","24836790"," You'll see."
"24838290","24841750"," Like we saw a lot of dark pool buying today at the end of the day as well at the"
"24841750","24842250"," same time."
"24846510","24847930"," What's a fun rent mean. "
"24852860","24854080"," What's what's fun rent."
"24856460","24857680"," V U N."
"24859040","24859520"," Dot."
"24860340","24861200"," R E N T."
"24866400","24867680"," Don't fuck with that guy. "
"24868060","24868540"," Hokey."
"24868900","24869320"," Joe."
"24871520","24874360"," We're going to have to go over there and find out who that that guy is. "
"24874720","24875540"," That's spam bot."
"24876300","24876760"," Hokey."
"24876860","24877140"," Vojic. "
"24877220","24877560"," Where's he?"
"24879280","24881440"," Okay, we're going to he's spam right."
"24883160","24884120"," Report user."
"24885120","24886780"," We'll put him down for child abuse. "
"24893490","24897090"," Let me know when the scammer bot shops second so I can report him for child abuse."
"24898390","24899670"," Oh, here's another one."
"24901970","24903850"," Report user for child abuse. "
"24910770","24916890"," Or scrolling through looking."
"24917110","24918670"," You guys know how to fight spam bots."
"24922030","24922850"," Winky take it easy. "
"24923130","24923550"," Mary take it."
"24923710","24924110"," Take it easy."
"24924110","24926730"," I love Josh. "
"24927050","24928810"," Massive crashes how it'll play out."
"24929110","24930610"," I fucking love Josh, by the way."
"24932050","24932970"," Fucking love him. "
"24940760","24941280"," Yeah."
"24941680","24942200"," I don't."
"24942880","24944740"," I think we have a bottom to this market in March. "
"24948950","24950250"," Have a great day, Starlight."
"24956200","24957480"," An Albanian bot."
"24965330","24967030"," Report him for kicking your dog. "
"24969190","24970350"," Flight with crossbow."
"24972890","24974750"," Yeah, you know, you know, it should have done."
"24974990","24978010"," If I played my if I thought about it, I should have bought some. "
"24978230","24979350"," You guys all have a great day."
"24979830","24980350"," Good night."
"24980530","24981370"," Good night, brother son. "
"24981790","24982450"," Good night, Josh."
"24983370","24988750"," If I had when I should have done was sold calls on on the spy, I think."
"24992630","24996850"," I would have liked to have sold those four 44 P's, to be honest. "
"24999360","25002240"," I have some put spreads to offload some Uber Bears tomorrow."
