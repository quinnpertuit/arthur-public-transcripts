"PhRszo8Gx_I","0","14000"," Good morning traders this is Captain Jim James with your daily brief I hope you're all were able to all of you were able to sleep in this morning get some rest after the wild day we had yesterday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","14000","29000"," I'm going to keep this one short and to the point there is one other topic I'll talk about and that's just about entries and exiting how to enter and exit plays so that they are all well not always but mostly going in your direction."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","30000","38000"," First up this morning the ADP numbers are not expected to be material all eyes are on Friday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","38000","53000"," We absolutely know that from yesterday's action and yes in the spy and SPX specifically the CDC reinstated the eviction moratorium whether that holds or sticks or the devil is in the details on that plan."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","53000","67000"," It doesn't really matter what matters is that it is hope for people that are affected by by the pandemic infrastructure deals back on the table and we're basically only missing another stimulus check."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","67000","77000"," Now I know earlier in the week we talked about those things being off the table and that they can be back on the table at any time and that's what that's just what happened yesterday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","78000","87000"," So this is probably a pump for bad numbers on Friday. We also have the 10 year down yesterday with those a second tap on on lows on the 10 year."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","87000","94000"," So I would expect that they're going to try to pump this up for the rest of the week. The fed did show its hands yesterday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","94000","106000"," You can call that bid on SPX and spy and NASDAQ whatever you like but surely Apple was bid up Amazon was bid up as well as the major indexes."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","107000","114000"," So at this point we do know that 46 or 436 10 is a no go zone."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","114000","124000"," Now the market and I want to stress this again the market likes to go in the path of least resistance where the sellers are or where the buyers are."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","125000","133000"," So I would expect today that we either go sideways and this established trading range that we have or we make a move up."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","133000","149000"," We will probe higher numbers. Now when we sold off back here on July 26th and July 29th most of this here is due to fair being too high in the market."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","150000","164000"," After being told yesterday nope we are at the bottom of the market over here at 436 10 the next logical step would be to build up a push for higher numbers or to go straight there to new all time highs."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","164000","173000"," Now we did do this last year in 2020. So don't be putting out that shocked Pikachu face if we do do that."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","173000","188000"," I just said do do twice. No shocked Pikachu faces if we start to look for this higher 440-44 or 445-59 and attempt to push it even higher."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","188000","193000"," Some people are talking about 450 as a price target now."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","193000","204000"," Last night I made a video and I was showing the bearish flag turning to a bull flag and I kind of got my lower support."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","204000","214000"," I got my lower support kind of wonky. What I really wanted to show you was this part of the bull flag that was developing as of last night."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","214000","219000"," So we're going to put this one in again one more time so you can see it. And there it is."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","219000","224000"," When I showed that spy chart last night two different spy charts it was actually this one right here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","224000","231000"," So this white flag here has now turned into a very bullish setup. The question is where do you buy in."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","231000","240000"," Do you buy or do we gap up immediately take a rest and shoot up or do we come down here and bounce off of let's say 43801."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","240000","244000"," That will be decided today I can't predict the future on that."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","244000","249000"," I would not expect this though to trade below this 437.90 number."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","249000","257000"," And I am not bearish until we go below 430 star today. It would be 435.95."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","257000","262000"," Unless we cross below this number I'm not bearish."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","262000","268000"," Now I have had some bears tell me that they got burned or upside down yesterday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","268000","275000"," One thing you have to consider whether you are a bull or a bear is when you are beginning your positions."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","275000","283000"," You can see here back in the 27th. Again let's say the 26th if you were a bull this was a signal to go long."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","283000","294000"," Same here in the 27th. And somewhere down here what you would have missed but we should have known that we were headed in this direction on the 30th."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","295000","299000"," Same thing goes as a bear you should be grabbing these tops here to come down."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","299000","306000"," So that same would hold true for today anywhere from this 440 to 442."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","306000","317000"," Now we did have a momentum change here yesterday which leads me to believe that the minimum we will attempt to tag this 442."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","317000","325000"," So consider this area here no man's land for bulls and bears in this area here no man's land for bulls and bears today."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","325000","328000"," Another issue is what exactly are you grabbing?"
"PhRszo8Gx_I","328000","335000"," If you are grabbing put spreads they are much safer and you can go outside of the money."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","335000","345000"," So if you were to grab a bear put spread up here let's say 441 they are not going to burn even if we bump up into this area up here 442."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","345000","349000"," When the same goes for bull call spreads over here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","349000","355000"," Now if an established trend develops let's take a look at the 5 day."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","355000","362000"," You can see down here we did bounce off 436-10 and you can see Claire's day bull flags."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","362000","370000"," You should be looking for 1-2-3 taps and grabbing these bottoms here if you are going to be playing FDs or weeklies."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","370000","374000"," The same goes for bear flags on the way down bears."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","374000","389000"," Now one more thing is this when I enter my positions and you should too your position wherever you are grabbing them should within the first few minutes maybe 15 at most be going in your direction."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","389000","393000"," Let's say up here you are seeing a bull flag here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","393000","398000"," This is on what the fourth I think the second."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","398000","403000"," Let's just pretend we thought this was a bull flag."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","403000","411000"," Let's say we are day trading here and we are saying to ourselves this thing is going to break up."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","411000","414000"," This is a great example right here especially for bulls."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","414000","419000"," Let's say we open the day and number one we are at 11.45 in the afternoon."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","419000","425000"," We already know that the middle of the daytime stocks and ETFs tend not to go up."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","425000","428000"," People take lunch right we talk about that every day."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","428000","431000"," That joke is about exactly that."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","431000","437000"," That's your first key indicator that we are not climbing in the middle of the afternoon."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","437000","443000"," The second indicator would be if you were to buy here and it falls off."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","443000","453000"," You could do this on the inverse as well if you were a bull or if you were bear and a bear flag fella or started to climb."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","453000","465000"," If your trade is not going your direction you need to wait for the first bounce back up and get out of it and rethink your timing of reentering that trade."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","465000","471000"," You've been a bull here, stayed in this trade, you never would have recovered from it."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","471000","474000"," It would have just kept burning you and burning you."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","474000","488000"," Even by coming back up here a day later so much time has passed and the intrinsic value of whatever option you had purchased had also burned off with time decay."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","488000","492000"," There is no real recovery had you bought calls in here to this point."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","492000","499000"," It's possible you would have come to maybe a 70% getting, let's say you get 70% of your money bag."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","499000","504000"," Especially on dailies that are FDs or weeklies."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","504000","513000"," Now if you had bought a monthly or a three month contract yes this would recover but it's most certainly not on these short dated call and put options."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","513000","523000"," So when you're playing a stock or an ETF on these short timeframes ensure that the movement is going in your direction immediately."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","523000","534000"," Now even then let's say you were playing FDs, let's say you're playing an FD on yesterday a call FD moving up into this close."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","534000","541000"," These are still going to lose their extrinsic value as they start to settle in."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","541000","546000"," Let's say you took an FD down here, these printed huge yesterday by the way."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","546000","551000"," I want to say they were 4 to 10,000% some of them."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","551000","555000"," They still burned off their value into the close yesterday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","555000","557000"," So your timing is crucial."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","557000","565000"," You need to be entering these trades winning immediately and then selling the moment they start to lose their value."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","565000","580000"," And especially yesterday if you were to do, if you had done 8.4 call FDs you would have written this up, sold, been ready to buy here and then sold, been ready to buy here and then sold up top."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","580000","584000"," Weekly, you're probably safe on a weekly on this trade right here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","584000","589000"," But any one two day trades you should be in and out."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","589000","595000"," And don't be believing the license profit calculator is going to tell you that you would be safe."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","595000","603000"," You will not be safe on any of these one, two, three, five day options with no intrinsic value."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","603000","608000"," They are only good for the run that's being made."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","608000","612000"," So if there's big movements you're going to catch that lightning in here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","612000","617000"," If you want the safer play I always recommend bull call spreads or you just buy yourself."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","617000","625000"," If you think the general direction is up over a couple days to a week you can still buy yourself a month out call option or a month out put option."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","625000","635000"," And have some defined de-risking or some defined stop loss 10, 20% if the trade is not immediately going in your direction."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","635000","647000"," I almost never hold positions that start to lose more than 10 to 20% unless I think that they're fishing for a lower bottom."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","647000","652000"," If they are fishing or if it looks like they're fishing for a lower bottom."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","652000","657000"," I'm entering a position on an ABC pattern let's say it starts here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","657000","661000"," I'll add more here and then add more as we continue up."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","661000","664000"," Let's say I'm betting 10% of my liquidity."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","664000","668000"," I'll start with 3% here, 3% here and 4% here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","668000","670000"," That averages in my position."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","670000","673000"," It gives me the time to confirm the direction of my trade."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","673000","680000"," And it also allows me to cut my losses down here if we break through this support level."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","680000","684000"," So just keep that in mind if you don't understand these mechanics already."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","684000","688000"," I am going to recommend that you stick with learning."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","688000","689000"," You know it's stopping."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","689000","700000"," Just stop trading for a day and spend some time learning how to execute basic bull and bear put call spreads."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","700000","702000"," There are some great videos on YouTube."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","702000","709000"," One of the best sites that I know to execute these trades and to actually learn some of the fundamental basic mechanics."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","709000","711000"," Check out options.ai."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","711000","713000"," I'm not affiliated with them."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","713000","715000"," Don't ask for an affiliated link."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","715000","723000"," But even if you don't fund that account you can run through the process of executing one of those plays"
"PhRszo8Gx_I","723000","725000"," and then transfer that play to your favorite broker."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","725000","728000"," So you've got my call for today on the spy."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","728000","731000"," I am bearish below 435.95."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","731000","737000"," This is a no go area for bulls and bears for 37.84."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","737000","744000"," I am bullish above 440.77, 440.94 somewhere in there."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","744000","750000"," Although I am looking for some confirmation at 442.49 for a push up to 445.41."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","750000","757000"," There are some bulls saying that we're going to try to jump over this trend line and start trading much higher."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","757000","759000"," Does that hold past Friday?"
"PhRszo8Gx_I","759000","760000"," I don't know."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","760000","761000"," I think that that's possible."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","761000","766000"," We're going to jump up here so that whatever bad news we've got coming Friday and possibly into Monday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","766000","771000"," Is lessened so that we don't break past this 430 mark."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","771000","775000"," Let's say that's increasing each day between now and Monday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","775000","777000"," Moving on to NDX."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","777000","781000"," Yesterday NASDAQ was looking very bearish."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","781000","783000"," Well worth selling the tops here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","783000","786000"," And this is where you should have taken a bearish position."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","786000","789000"," This was on the second, not yesterday on the third."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","789000","795000"," You wouldn't be taking this bearish position here until we talked about breaking 14800."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","795000","799000"," My position remains the same on NDX."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","799000","803000"," Although we did jump above resistance yesterday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","803000","810000"," My expected daily range for today is 507 to 15128."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","810000","817000"," I am expecting us to try to push up and bounce around in this trading range and do some consolidation."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","818000","821000"," If we do get above 15128."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","821000","829000"," The next place you're looking for would be 15196 would be the next resistance."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","829000","832000"," The trading somewhere in here today turns out to be bullish."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","832000","839000"," If you're bearish on NASDAQ, you are most certainly looking for a break below 15013."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","839000","844000"," Although even if you break through here, I doubt you were able to penetrate this 14800."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","844000","847000"," That's probably being saved for Friday or Monday."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","847000","849000"," Moving on to the IWM."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","849000","854000"," The IWM is definitely turning into what we've been talking about for the past week."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","854000","856000"," All this is known at this point."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","856000","858000"," We are within a range."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","858000","861000"," You're looking at the upper part of the range is 22."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","861000","866000"," 3.56 and the lower end of the range, 215.72."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","866000","869000"," Right now you are in No Man's Land."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","869000","873000"," I would expect tight trading within this for the rest of today."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","873000","883000"," Let's call today a high of 221.6221.63 and a low of 218.45."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","883000","887000"," I wouldn't expect too much out of the IWM today."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","887000","899000"," What you can do is find yourself a volume scanner on the internet and find out which stocks are running or which stocks are dying in the small caps today."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","899000","904000"," Also Twitter, Wall Street Bets, whatever your favorite social media is."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","904000","907000"," You will see these names pop up throughout the day."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","907000","909000"," Alright, I think I got it all on that, right?"
"PhRszo8Gx_I","909000","911000"," Now let's move on to Tesla."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","911000","916000"," I know Tesla games, Tesla Q is probably wondering what's going on in Tesla Land."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","916000","921000"," Nothing has changed in my overall viewpoint of Tesla."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","921000","925000"," I still want to reinforce to you that we move."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","925000","927000"," This move here was 12%."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","927000","931000"," And we are seeing some consolidation here in Tesla."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","931000","935000"," The market has proved itself to be bullish for trading it today."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","935000","945000"," I would expect if we are bullish today and you're trading it today and want to go along 7.05.37, if that holds, expect to move up."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","945000","949000"," Though I do think that Tesla somewhat moves on its own."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","949000","957000"," I am still looking to go along down here around 6.72 for my own personal trading."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","957000","964000"," I always like to see Tesla come back and rest for a little bit before it makes its next move higher."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","964000","972000"," There are times in the past where we skipped this move down for consolidation and we will rip much higher."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","973000","980000"," If we do move much higher today, you're going to be looking to buy again, as I said earlier, somewhere around 7.05.37."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","980000","989000"," You're going to be looking for sellers at 7.26.35 and then another major resistance up here at 7.40.52."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","989000","992000"," One more just to harp on this once more."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","992000","997000"," I always like seeing Tesla come back to consolidate."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","997000","1002000"," If you're a real Tesla bull, I guess, you should as well."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1002000","1011000"," The stronger when you see this strength down here, this provides a base for maintaining price over time."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1011000","1018000"," If you want this to shoot up, let's say to 800 this week, this will create a giant gap."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1018000","1024000"," That on the first bad news or FUD that's sent out, Tesla is going to crash."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1024000","1032000"," You want to be creating, they're not bag holders, but this is bullish sentiment here."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1032000","1038000"," These are people that are holding for the long haul on Tesla."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1038000","1049000"," I would expect that we're going to come back and hopefully maybe retest down here at some point, if not today in the coming month."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1049000","1062000"," My call for today is if you're feeling froggy and very bullish, if we tag 7.05.37, you can take that run up to, let's say, 7.26."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1062000","1070000"," The risky play would be 7.40 or you wait for it to come back and go heavy long to 800."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1070000","1075000"," I hope you all have a great day trading today. Please like and subscribe."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1075000","1079000"," This is the way for me to know that you guys like these videos."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1079000","1089000"," Please find me on Twitter and reach out to me if I can improve these video briefs or if there's more you'd like me to see from me."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1089000","1099000"," I am going to try to add in a live stream on Saturday or Sunday mornings, maybe 10 or 12, 10 a.m. 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1099000","1114000"," If I do it at 12, I can grab the West Coasters to come join us and then maybe I'll add one more video every week with plays, maybe 5 to 10 plays to keep on your radar for the upcoming week."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1114000","1129000"," Maybe I can do that on the other day. Saturday I could do some stocks to consider for the following week and then Sunday we could do a live stream so that we could discuss all kinds of stuff, whatever you guys are interested in discussing."
"PhRszo8Gx_I","1129000","1137000"," Anyways like and subscribe please have a great day and I hope you guys all make money today. Good luck."
