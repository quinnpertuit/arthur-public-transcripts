"58940","60140"," Good morning, everybody."
"61280","62180"," How's everybody doing?"
"64379","68560"," Good morning, Harushi, your wife's boyfriend, good to see your brother."
"69120","87620"," Little big bear, Dylan, Angie, Gerald, Mario, Fisted, Matt, Corey, Dan,"
"87620","88820"," some fast money this morning. "
"88980","90040"," I'm kind of happy about it."
"90180","94380"," I was running around and then I placed the trade, took the trade off, made some money."
"95940","98500"," So we'll take a look, we'll jump right in. "
"98600","99720"," You saw the bounce this morning."
"100340","103060"," As a matter of fact, I'll bring this over here."
"104940","106720"," Bring over a couple things over here. "
"107340","108360"," I'll have a couple of these."
"110340","111140"," We'll take a look."
"112560","114420"," We're getting a quick bounce right now. "
"114420","115580"," I'll switch right over here."
"116000","117320"," Just a second here and we get that."
"117380","118540"," We get that entry music down. "
"118720","119880"," We'll switch right over here."
"121360","122380"," Good morning, everybody."
"122680","123880"," We'll switch right into the live stream. "
"124940","125880"," Good morning, everybody."
"126100","126820"," Good morning, Angie, Mike."
"127639","129000"," Grab one cowboy up, Zach. "
"129419","129740"," Good morning."
"130840","133700"," So just right off the bat this morning, I ended up selling a couple things."
"133980","135100"," I was able to get back here. "
"135240","137100"," I sold my calls up here from yesterday."
"138020","138820"," I think I broke even."
"139160","143000"," I either broke even or I else checking to see if I was down maybe just a few bucks. "
"143580","145180"," But I tried to get out of my calls here."
"146340","148480"," I haven't had a chance to buy this yet down here."
"149520","152400"," But I did buy a dip on Twitter as well. "
"153840","159540"," There's supposedly, and I don't know about everything that's going on with Twitter at this point,"
"159680","161640"," but we'll get into Twitter here in just a minute."
"162120","162840"," And we'll talk about it."
"162880","169700"," But I want to go over a few things with you this morning about what to expect and why I"
"169700","174380"," sold my calls right off the bell was because SparkM was down this morning, but I had a chance to"
"175960","178840"," had a chance to sell out of this for a reason. "
"179060","179760"," We're going to talk about here."
"179860","183340"," It's important that we talk about what to expect the rest of the day."
"184940","189580"," As the day moves forward, then into next week is important as we line up over the weekend. "
"190580","193080"," And I have some I have to talk to you guys about some other stuff too."
"193160","197440"," We get some macro stuff to talk about with where the market can go, the potential for the market I"
"197440","198660"," was posting about it late last night."
"199260","201620"," So at some point, we'll talk about that this morning as well. "
"203180","205160"," We want to talk about the spot."
"205160","206400"," Every part of this morning is kind of interesting."
"207220","208880"," I wasn't expecting this report this morning. "
"209740","211680"," We talked something about this yesterday."
"212420","218340"," If we can get up to 450 today and you know, do we run out of fuel yesterday?"
"218340","220520"," We talked briefly about that as well."
"220900","223500"," And we tagged up here at this 44473. "
"225360","228300"," We know that that up here, 445 is resistance."
"229040","231240"," Talked about the top being up here."
"232400","238900"," If we can get some calls structured to get up here for some puts, some puts down here to be"
"238900","239680"," monetized. "
"241200","245180"," Hopefully propel us up at some point, but there's a key here."
"246280","249800"," I'll get into the report here in just a minute, but they're point what the basically spot getting"
"249800","253560"," his report this morning was if we trade down here this morning, right?"
"255820","261460"," Let's say towards this 436 level or even lower and we'll look at the book map as a book map"
"261460","262920"," showing a deep number down here too."
"263560","268200"," This morning, I can look at book map real quick, but I want you to see something real quick here. "
"269420","271900"," There's no hell of a lot of support here at 450 440."
"271900","276960"," And it's kind of like a big push down below, right?"
"277140","280660"," 438, 435."
"281040","281860"," We know about 433. "
"282520","285240"," This is the mark that we've been looking for for the past couple of days, right?"
"285360","287260"," To get down to that 43440."
"287820","289240"," We got 430 down below here."
"290940","299900"," Then their point this morning was that you could see aggressive put buying if we trade low today in"
"299900","302980"," anticipation of having a down week next week. "
"306490","307550"," And why does that matter?"
"308710","311770"," So we'll read through it together and see if we can interpret this together."
"313790","315230"," Let me see if I can bring this up."
"315390","315950"," Well, don't wait a minute. "
"316170","316570"," Hold on here."
"319070","320570"," I just want to read through this with you this morning."
"321510","326730"," So if you just held a quiet overnight slash currently trading at 440, 440, we look for muted"
"326730","334690"," volatility today with an SD implied move of only 0.67%. So kind of a slow day, right?"
"336130","338430"," And we bounced off 445 after Bell. "
"338710","342290"," So question becomes, we're actually going to go up to 450 probably not."
"343110","347670"," So that would make us that would give us the move lower and trading within a range today, right?"
"348690","351050"," Resistance remains at 445, then 4475."
"351710","355770"," So that's slightly below the 450 number. "
"356730","362150"," Support shows at 443, then 442, right?"
"362350","362730"," 4435."
"364450","365410"," This is up here, right?"
"367210","371050"," And then 442 is down, down slightly where we are just down in here."
"373640","379540"," We still register equal or less than or greater than whatever. "
"379540","382880"," The SPX QQ is gamma rolling off today ahead of the three-day weekend."
"383400","386640"," This is probably negative put gamma that is going away."
"387340","390580"," In line with this, now stated for the last several days, we thought that this put heavy exploration"
"390580","391320"," into a long weekend. "
"391540","394900"," We provide fuel for a market lift with yesterday's 1% shift higher, though."
"394980","396620"," We think that that fuel is largely burned up."
"398300","402080"," It also hands the low implied move for today, right?"
"403400","405100"," And that 445 is now fair value. "
"405260","407040"," We tagged that on the opening bell."
"407700","411060"," As shown below, it's dominant gamma strike on the board, a large amount of which expires today."
"413260","414560"," Very rare at 440, right?"
"415500","418100"," Ultimately, we're in a no-man's land at current levels. "
"419160","421320"," This exploration removes the fair amount of put support."
"422920","427280"," There is now significant or there's now no significant opx until 520."
"427980","429260"," That's important to know too, right?"
"430320","436880"," Means they're on a ton of calls or a ton of puts of concentration until May 20th. "
"436900","442640"," The positioning is very neutral as per being at the gamma flip line, the vault trigger at 4, 4, 3,"
"442740","443020"," 5."
"443820","445180"," This makes the signing an edge difficult."
"445540","447420"," What's expiring does open the market to lower lows?"
"448340","453540"," Does it keep part that Winky talks about often in Discord and on this YouTube channel?"
"453680","455480"," We've discussed this as a group too, right?"
"461940","467300"," We've taken gamma positions or just large put tall positions when they expire, that we make a move"
"467300","473440"," lower or higher after where everyone thinks it's going to go right."
"473600","481160"," So May 20th, everyone thinks to go to 4,000, but do we actually go to 4,000 the week"
"481160","481540"," after?"
"482740","486480"," And that opens the door this week, an upcoming for us to trade lower. "
"488960","494220"," So the point is that puts expiring does open the market to lower lows that should selling pick up"
"494220","494620"," next week."
"494780","498840"," Further, you may note that many of our key strikes have been shifting lower vault trigger, put"
"498840","504020"," wall, call wall, all of which suggests the systematic rolling down of options positions, right?"
"504180","506160"," So that what that means right there is that that's right here."
"506920","510920"," What that means is that your call wall and your put wall are lowering, right?"
"511260","512820"," In your trading range, right?"
"512940","514860"," Our expectations of going higher are lowering. "
"515100","522000"," We know that the market's rolling over and we know that there is a, you know, we're buying"
"522000","526960"," individual stocks, but spies is kind of trading sideways at this point, right?"
"527140","527960"," We already know that's happening."
"528120","532160"," We already know that there should be a capitulation move coming up in the current week upcoming,"
"532260","532600"," right?"
"534000","535580"," And expectations that we're not going to go that higher."
"535580","538080"," We're not going to go to 4, 60 right now, right?"
"538260","542320"," So all these levels are moving down is the point that they're trying to make. "
"544780","548700"," Traders have been monetizing puts, but you have yet to position into upside calls."
"549260","550160"," And why should they, right?"
"550340","551940"," So they're taking the profits off of puts."
"552740","554320"," We haven't, we haven't entered calls in the market. "
"554400","558140"," We're not getting that second part of that rally that you expect from a VANA rally with with charm,"
"558140","558460"," right?"
"558880","563920"," As you can see below gamma reduces with days expiration and note the kink around 440 that goes"
"563920","564180"," away."
"564340","571380"," That is due to 440 and 4400 on SPX puts being removed, just leads to reduced negative gap position."
"572180","577540"," Through another lens this or you can see this says fewer put positions in a market that has less"
"577540","578240"," hedges. "
"579080","581160"," And this is the conversation with Winky, right?"
"581320","583360"," We ended up targeting those lower lows."
"584040","588440"," And if we're not buying calls that are higher, it opens the door to us trading lower, right?"
"588800","591820"," For call wall is now lower and our put wall is now lower."
"592840","597500"," We can actually tag those numbers that everyone was hoping for this week, 420, let's say, right?"
"598560","604000"," If new puts are added, that voice negative delta hedging on to dealers, AKA short futures, that"
"604000","606140"," means we sell the nighttime, right?"
"606660","607500"," And downside pressure. "
"608340","612520"," You ever notice how when we start trading down, you'll see that we're selling futures every night"
"612520","613020"," as well, right?"
"613500","617760"," It likely puts, it's likely puts would add, would be added at lower strikes."
"618140","624640"," So we'd have a new lower bound now at a lower strike, something like 4300 versus 4400 this week for"
"624640","624980"," example."
"626300","628680"," We must note the SP is technically above the ball trigger. "
"629400","631780"," Per model is compels us to give an edge to the bullish side."
"631940","634680"," However, we expect the strike to shift into Monday."
"636180","639420"," More than likely shift down, not up, right?"
"640320","645520"," We likely want to recapture a 1 or recapture a 4500 line to signal true risk on type position. "
"646100","650540"," So the point they're trying to make is that, we'll look at a larger chart here."
"651620","656560"," What we're trying to make is that, you know, if you don't see call buying here today, right?"
"656780","660680"," And we don't capture, we don't, we don't trade higher here, right?"
"660840","663240"," And outside of this, this wedge that we're in, right?"
"663360","670780"," If we don't fade out of this, today, let's say, we can't say that we're in a bullish stance, even"
"670780","671940"," if we're in negative gamma, right?"
"671980","677160"," Even if we're in a bear town, sort of way to say, right?"
"677720","681420"," We're not breaking out of this today, and it doesn't look like we are at this moment right here."
"682040","684820"," So this actually, you've got this 440 line down here. "
"685140","690000"," What that opens up is it opens up, let me close this up for a minute here."
"690940","694040"," What this opens up is for next week, right?"
"694260","703680"," For a trading range to be somewhere right somewhere, you know, in here, somewhere in here, right?"
"703820","707160"," So for next week, we're going to be trading this zone in here."
"707400","711940"," If we're not adding calls into today, I call it, I'll call Friday, but today's Friday, it's"
"711940","712500"," Thursday, right?"
"712740","716800"," We've got good Friday tomorrow, got a Easter, got the Easter running common, but so that opens the"
"716800","720040"," door to a lower trading range this week. "
"720980","730320"," We talked about putting on some in the money, put"
"730320","732580"," hedges for the upcoming week."
"734100","736120"," Spark Amazon, we got our rally here."
"736220","737780"," We're not getting that fueled rally up today. "
"737940","745640"," Now, if we see something different today, I just saw some Zoom, ZM July 15th calls, 100 C's, $1.9"
"745640","747440"," million just came in."
"747600","752640"," We got some more Zoom calls, June 17th, 105 C, $8.3 million."
"752980","755480"," I like that, but we're not seeing it in the indexes, right?"
"756700","759120"," So we're going to pay a tent, but there's a couple of things that you need to do today. "
"760160","763540"," If you haven't bought put hedges for next week, put spreads, right?"
"763740","765180"," If at any point today, we trade higher."
"765720","767560"," You should be put some kind of a hedge on."
"768140","773900"," I talked to you about us trading higher in the end of the month of April, but that next week,"
"773900","775000"," we could go to a lower bound. "
"775960","784160"," How this works itself out is that we trade sideways and eventually down until we find a level of"
"784160","788860"," support where bulls feel confident and say, hey, we can take this from 430, we can take this from"
"788860","789980"," 420 and trade it higher."
"790820","791120"," Okay."
"791480","796140"," And if we don't find the people buying calls right here, it'll trade sideways and down until we do"
"796140","798200"," find people buying calls, if that makes sense. "
"799120","806680"," So with that said, if we don't recapture 450 today, if you don't see tons of calls coming in today,"
"806680","812840"," you should be looking at some point today into the close to buy some protection, buy some some put"
"812840","813680"," some put threads."
"813920","815200"," That doesn't mean you're a retail trader."
"815320","820560"," It doesn't mean you just buy blindly put weekly puts expiring next next Friday. "
"820920","825840"," And the other issue that you have with buying puts is we're even just sending kind of protection is"
"825840","829420"," that if you have to deal with the theta burn that takes place over three days."
"829860","831620"," So let's say we close today."
"832100","835720"," Let's say we close at 445 and we open on Monday at 440. "
"836180","839400"," You're not going to realize those gains like you would if you had a put thread."
"839840","843440"," What if we spike up on Monday and then we actually start trading down, you're not you're going to"
"843440","844120"," get burned, right?"
"844240","848560"," So there's all kinds of opportunity for you taking a short position and getting kind of fucked"
"848560","848920"," over."
"849100","854700"," So look for a point today, unless we trade we can trade higher today with the monetization of puts,"
"854700","859960"," but that gives you the opportunity if you don't see heavy call flow come in leading into next week"
"859960","861580"," and into the end of April. "
"862500","866720"," And I still think that we can I think we can roll over into next week, find a sweet bottom"
"866720","875100"," and run it up real nice for another down move for the May for the May OPEC in the FOMC"
"875100","875380"," shit."
"875520","881860"," I think you'll get up with one more chance to short the market down coming into the end of April."
"882480","886440"," I think it I think it's wise to put some protection on into next week. "
"886440","891000"," Maybe you date them for Friday or Monday of next week, whatever that expiry is."
"892160","897340"," And and that you look for here, let me close this up a little bit here."
"898400","904060"," And then you're going to look for my view at least we talked about this yesterday before we closed"
"904060","904600"," it out, right?"
"905180","909880"," And in my view, I thought that I thought we could go up today, but I thought I would still"
"909880","912340"," roll over into next week, right?"
"912600","915760"," And then you get that one last ripper up here, for the end of the month. "
"916800","917900"," So these dates aren't right."
"917980","920500"," I'm not drawn this correctly, but you get the one more ripper."
"920620","921640"," That's your 430, right?"
"921740","923020"," You tagged your 430 down here. "
"923440","927760"," And then rolling into let's say the 29th of April, you'd start a slow descent down."
"928180","934220"," So let's say 420, you're not going to hit the 4000 into the FOMC meeting like everybody expects us"
"934220","934460"," to."
"934800","939400"," But maybe the next week, you'll hit 4000 after the FOMC OPEC, right?"
"939760","944500"," Well, let's say they all the all let's say we spike higher because all the fairs already know about"
"944500","945340"," it's all priced in. "
"945560","949020"," And then we roll it over for like a week or two down finally to that 4000."
"950200","955420"," Then we get a face ripping rally up to like 460 or something stupid, because all you know, all the,"
"955420","960680"," all the, all the volatility is taken out of that FOMC."
"961560","967480"," So at some point today, look for some put hedges in the money, you can buy them now, you can"
"967480","968020"," buy them later. "
"968720","971760"," If you feel like we'll squeeze up into the clothes, you can put them on then we talked about"
"971760","972740"," putting them on back here."
"973060","976000"," But I put some on even if you're going to day trade next week, just put some in the money,"
"976000","976760"," put threads on."
"977220","978560"," It's something that's peace of mind. "
"979900","981180"," Do what we talked about?"
"981180","982960"," Do I think we talked yesterday, right?"
"983060","984540"," Do I think we're going to revisit 445?"
"985280","985400"," Yes."
"986340","991640"," Do I think that if we traded higher on Monday up here that we'll revisit heading into the end of"
"991640","991640"," April?"
"991660","991920"," Yes."
"992140","993180"," So what do you date them for?"
"993440","997880"," I think aggressively you date them for Friday or Monday of like Friday of next week or the or the"
"997880","1003120"," Monday after yesterday I said to you just buy them for May, for the May expiry. "
"1003500","1005220"," Put some put, put spreads on in the money."
"1005420","1007360"," I think yesterday they were paying almost 200%."
"1007360","1009420"," It's a no brainer to put that trade on. "
"1009940","1013580"," Don't look at it and just hold on to it until it monetizes itself."
"1014280","1017480"," Regardless if we trade up at the end of April, we're going to come back down."
"1017620","1019040"," We know we're going to see lower than 445. "
"1019780","1020340"," I think we know."
"1020640","1025960"," I think there's a good chance we're going to see lower than 445 and 440, believe it or I think"
"1025960","1028859"," yesterday the trade I had put on was 445 to 440."
"1029640","1030859"," That's a put spread, right?"
"1031260","1034540"," You know you're going to see that, you know you're going to see that trade print at some point"
"1034540","1035700"," between now and May 18. "
"1036079","1040260"," Just keep that keep that in your mind as we go forward here."
"1041119","1046660"," Keep that in mind that over the week and the expectation is if we don't see a bid into the"
"1046660","1050000"," market that we're going to go down that event that we're going to go down next."
"1050140","1053260"," Remember we're going to have a week week next week, right?"
"1053580","1059360"," I don't know why I'm saying week, week, but and we've also looked at the market breadth, right?"
"1059480","1061760"," We've been looking at that market breadth often. "
"1061760","1064760"," We're going to bring it up again right now and just take one more look at it this morning."
"1066460","1068040"," And this is an indicator."
"1068300","1069140"," This is something we use. "
"1069860","1071340"," This is something I'll give you a second here."
"1072040","1073840"," This is something that we use, right?"
"1075000","1079560"," To just just just get an idea of what is happening."
"1080240","1081260"," Hold on a second here. "
"1086360","1087560"," Can we just one second here?"
"1089760","1090280"," Here."
"1094780","1099260"," There's something that we we end up using here to find out what's going on, right?"
"1099360","1099760"," Are we rotating?"
"1100660","1102480"," Are we finding a bid in the market?"
"1103660","1105540"," Are we rolling over, right?"
"1105840","1107420"," Are we rotating and rolling over?"
"1108180","1112880"," And we'll take a move this down over here."
"1113940","1115240"," I like to let this load up here. "
"1115780","1117540"," We're in the one one one here here."
"1117640","1118600"," That's the one here."
"1119200","1120760"," We'll let that load up here for a minute. "
"1120840","1122420"," We'll take a look at it here in just a second."
"1122880","1124080"," We already know that we're kind of wrote."
"1124200","1125820"," We know we know we've been rotating in here. "
"1126120","1127780"," We know that we're rolling over in here."
"1127920","1129820"," We know that the breadth in the market is going down."
"1129920","1131920"," These are all things that we already know, right?"
"1134380","1136520"," We can look at it right here and we can see it, right?"
"1136520","1141340"," If we're going to be buying calls, long calls, month out calls, three month out calls, whatever,"
"1141620","1143400"," calls to a price call spreads. "
"1143940","1145140"," We know the buy was down here."
"1145680","1147720"," We know right here that we're rolling it over here."
"1147860","1152260"," We can see the breadth going down and the price is not going up, right?"
"1152560","1156820"," We know that we're waiting to actually buy calls and confidence down here when we're down here like"
"1156820","1157660"," 250 or lower. "
"1158060","1161380"," We can see the red 623 pretty decent bid in the market."
"1161800","1163840"," It's at 51.6%. Not bad."
"1164540","1167880"," We could trade higher from here, but we know the market's rolling over. "
"1167980","1170380"," We know in the cycle or at the asset of one of these cycles."
"1171160","1174820"," So if you're going to buy a put spread and you put enough time on it, right?"
"1175640","1177980"," It's probably going to print for you at some point, right?"
"1178220","1179000"," Date it out in the May."
"1179280","1180800"," It's probably going to print for you at some point. "
"1181100","1182800"," We know we've got volatility coming in May."
"1183340","1184680"," We know it's not that far away."
"1184760","1186680"," It's almost it's only like a month away from now. "
"1187820","1192560"," So there's no reason not to put that trade on where we are right now."
"1193640","1199100"," Now with all that out of the way, we'll get rid of that."
"1199260","1206140"," So they're highlighting that in their report for you today and they're telling you to use caution"
"1206140","1207740"," as we move forward. "
"1208280","1209600"," And we're not seeing the bid, right?"
"1209800","1211500"," We saw this bounce down here this morning."
"1212260","1214400"," We had a little small trade range."
"1214400","1216980"," They're telling you that the implied move today is small. "
"1217420","1217960"," What does that mean?"
"1218140","1223180"," That means that if you want trade today, take trades today in the spy or in the market that you"
"1223180","1224680"," have a defined trading zone, right?"
"1224980","1226460"," You know the top's up here right now."
"1226680","1228840"," You know currently that the bottom is down here at 440."
"1229380","1231680"," You can probably trade in here at some point today. "
"1232100","1232960"," Take trades, right?"
"1233100","1235180"," Buy dips, sell rips today."
"1235360","1237200"," You've seen this on Friday's."
"1237300","1238300"," Often we've done this, right?"
"1238640","1242320"," It just trades up and down and then it eventually will sell off the end of the day. "
"1242820","1250320"," I don't know where we're at in the sell-off towards end of day."
"1250380","1251420"," That's what we have a prediction for today."
"1251680","1257340"," For today is that we trade in a zone in the spy and I think we trade down into the"
"1257340","1257520"," close. "
"1257800","1262920"," And what's funny about that as I bet that you'll see that put buying once we get down there rather"
"1262920","1265800"," than buying it up here, they're going to wait."
"1266100","1269760"," You'll see them wait until we fucking trade down into the close and then all of a sudden you'll see"
"1269760","1273760"," rolling hedges come in and rolling puts for the anticipation of next week."
"1274100","1275000"," Don't wait for that. "
"1275200","1281700"," Wait for if we get up here one more time today, get some protection on yourself heading into next"
"1281700","1282040"," week."
"1282640","1285260"," And now if you're like, hey Cap, what if we go up though and I don't want to lose all"
"1285260","1286200"," my money, right?"
"1286340","1287080"," Not financial advice."
"1287620","1288500"," Put more time on it. "
"1288700","1291060"," I told you that yesterday I said put them out for May 18th."
"1291220","1296060"," I can't give you financial advice that's going to print into May 18th, but you and I know in most"
"1296060","1301880"," of the market knows, I think like Joe the Barber knows in Billy Bob that's a mechanic knows if he's"
"1301880","1306840"," got money in the market that there's a huge meeting coming up in May, right?"
"1307040","1307600"," We all know that."
"1307640","1308920"," We all know there'll be volatility. "
"1309120","1313300"," There always is every single time coming into next month."
"1313560","1314680"," Just throw some put hedges on."
"1314940","1320560"," Probably your best bet is to wait to see if we can trade higher here at some point, maybe even"
"1320560","1322940"," up in here, looking for a rejection. "
"1323200","1325600"," Just take your time today, be patient today."
"1325840","1329960"," If you don't want to do this day trading up and down goofiness, if you don't want to trade, make"
"1329960","1335220"," these trades here, these quick trades, just wait, just hang out for today on a Friday, wait for a"
"1335220","1339840"," chance to put some protection on the market, grab some put spreads, date them however you like,"
"1340220","1341500"," whatever kind of risk you want to put on."
"1341620","1345620"," If you're a bull, it's not your time to buy in calls right now, it really isn't. "
"1345680","1349380"," I'm going to tell you your time to buying calls is probably next week at some point."
"1349700","1354920"," If we can get some rollover and then some actual rollover in the market, and if we don't get that"
"1354920","1358760"," rollover in the market trade sideways in the May, you might be waiting for, believe it or not, the"
"1358760","1364060"," Apple MC to throw something nice on that you can put on and with confidence, right?"
"1364280","1370400"," So we have two opportunities for bulls and for bears, you know what you got to do."
"1370560","1374380"," If you took this short up here, or if you took yesterday about some put spreads, you're in the good"
"1374380","1374660"," to go. "
"1375160","1380600"," I wouldn't expect this to roll over today to start day trading like heavy bear action, you might be"
"1380600","1382300"," able to buy some put spread at the bell up here."
"1382300","1387360"," If we were to squeeze higher, if we have monetization of put, let's say we don't sell off of the"
"1387360","1393260"," clothes and we actually squeeze higher, so bears can get better positioning one more time, then"
"1393260","1397240"," maybe you can maybe you can take some puts at the bell for Monday."
"1397760","1402380"," But I would not be buying just like straight up puts, right?"
"1402640","1408460"," Like holding just diamond handing puts today for expiry sometime next week. "
"1408460","1412980"," You're talking about, excuse me, four days of theta burn."
"1413220","1414620"," So think about put spreads."
"1415740","1419280"," I don't know if you should be putting on put back spreads right now. "
"1419860","1423920"," I don't know if I don't think we're going to go down to 4000 like like the dream or like"
"1423920","1425600"," the fever dreams that bears have."
"1425620","1427140"," Maybe we do, but I don't think that we do."
"1428100","1433500"," And there's some actual bull, there's some actual bull tail risk. "
"1433520","1435000"," I talked about it on Twitter last night."
"1435080","1439740"," I'll get into it later this morning for you that we could actually go to all-time highs."
"1440160","1445740"," I don't know if it's I don't know if it's now or if it's after FOMC in June, but we"
"1445740","1453440"," have a high chance at some point that we could actually trade up and out of where we are right"
"1453440","1453640"," now. "
"1453760","1454780"," There is a slim chance."
"1455080","1459080"," Even today, we could start that trade today that there's a very off chance."
"1459420","1463180"," Everybody wants the market and knows that the market is going down into this debate. "
"1463420","1464440"," This is the easy way to say it."
"1465020","1471800"," Everybody knows the markets going down into the next FOMC and you could out of nowhere just see the"
"1471800","1477860"," market just fucking crazy rip and just blast everybody's asses."
"1478460","1480080"," Just keep that in the back of your mind. "
"1480740","1488320"," I was talking about some penny calls that they cost nothing for that risk."
"1489280","1491000"," There's actually upside risk."
"1491180","1495480"," It's kind of like if we're trading all-time highs, you know, once every month or so and people are"
"1495480","1501600"," putting tail risk hedges on, like just like put back spreads, look at it from a from a bull risk"
"1501600","1502140"," perspective. "
"1502520","1506960"," There's a small small tiny outside chance that we can go to all-time highs."
"1507420","1508320"," So be aware of that as well."
"1508380","1514540"," So let's say put a put spread on and you buy some penny calls for some time between now and"
"1514540","1519080"," June that are way outside the money, like almost almost all-time highs. "
"1520400","1524660"," Then just hold on to them for letting me show."
"1524780","1527480"," I showed that trade yesterday printed 200% of the put spread."
"1527920","1531540"," So if you were to just buy, let's say you spent two grand on a put spread and then you"
"1531540","1536060"," buy a grand in but I would do that. "
"1536060","1541840"," I would buy, I don't know, like four grand in put spreads and then maybe a thousand bucks in an"
"1541840","1543580"," off chance that we trade higher."
"1543720","1548400"," That way you'll still make like 100% profit on the put side regardless if we ever get that that"
"1548400","1549420"," all-time high print."
"1549540","1551580"," But believe it or not, that print is possible there. "
"1552460","1556880"," So we're going to take a look back on book map right here."
"1556880","1557860"," We're going to load up Twitter."
"1559620","1561240"," We're going to take a look at Twitter real quick. "
"1562100","1569660"," It was to sell 16 million in 20-month reopen bonds, 20 million in five-year tips, 34 billion to"
"1569660","1574840"," 52 week bills, 57 billion in 13 big bills and 48 billion in 26-week bills."
"1576810","1580450"," The boat is loaded right now on Twitter calls."
"1581050","1583570"," I bought 50 C's and then I sold them. "
"1583990","1584510"," Let's see here."
"1587360","1592700"," Then we are at this point on Twitter right now where we are getting that nice little wedge down"
"1592700","1592940"," here."
"1593640","1599160"," And my assumption is that if there's any kind of an announcement, I haven't seen anything yet. "
"1599260","1603060"," I don't have an up right now but I'm going to search for Twitter right now to see what there's"
"1603060","1603480"," any news."
"1603680","1605340"," But my point being is this."
"1605620","1609660"," If you were to buy a, don't hold on. "
"1610060","1611020"," I don't want to do that."
"1611280","1612260"," I don't want to do that."
"1613120","1613780"," I want to do that. "
"1614340","1616820"," My point here was that you're going to get a violent move."
"1617020","1621520"," Depending what that board meeting decision is, you could get a violent move."
"1621620","1624240"," You can also get a violent move even before the decision comes out. "
"1624500","1630540"," Something like this, right, where we swing high, swing low like we do in FMC and you could have a"
"1630540","1635300"," straddle even a strangle and you monetize one side and monetize the other side."
"1636160","1638620"," And you'll actually get a print on both sides."
"1639400","1641100"," It's very call heavy right now. "
"1641440","1650180"," We'll monitor the call and put action to see where Twitter goes this morning and see if we can get"
"1650180","1652520"," a face or a prod of it."
"1652780","1657960"," I do know that if they approve that sale, at least from their board meeting, that when that does"
"1657960","1663580"," happen to companies that are public and then take them private, that they tend to double."
"1664340","1669060"," Often they will double in price by the end of close of that decision being made. "
"1669960","1674060"," So I wouldn't be shocked if they decided, I don't know if there's a decision right now if they"
"1674060","1676540"," postpone it, I haven't searched to find it."
"1676620","1677180"," I'll look right now."
"1677300","1679940"," Maybe I'm talking on my ass because it'll not up to date on the news. "
"1681880","1690860"," But if there is a decision regardless, either way, what says right here, it says, Twitter will hold"
"1690860","1698860"," an all hands meeting with employees at 2 p.m. Pacific time to discuss the Musk offer."
"1699600","1701560"," That was 10 minutes ago from Walter Bloomberg."
"1703860","1707920"," So it doesn't really matter if it doesn't really matter what the decision is. "
"1707920","1711000"," What does matter is that it's going to swing."
"1711340","1714860"," It's going to swing violently down or it's going to swing violently up."
"1715440","1723740"," So the chance for you to buy a straddle or a strangle, either that you tag a tag number high"
"1723740","1727720"," or low, or even just a straddle that you start moving one way or the other. "
"1728160","1733740"," And the chance of it, just through the volatility that'll take place, you'll probably monetize both"
"1733740","1737180"," sides at some point today, even if it's end of day."
"1737780","1741020"," So we'll monitor it as the day moves forward as we get closer to that two o'clock hour."
"1741700","1744860"," And maybe I'll put another trade on here around. "
"1745540","1750160"," Well, I'm going to watch the option chain here for the next hour or two, and then roughly around 1"
"1750160","1755660"," p.m. I'll enter another trade live with you this morning on Twitter."
"1756260","1759000"," Because I'm interested to see which way it moves."
"1759520","1764660"," But wait, now it's saying the Saddam saying, someone says, Twitter to hold a staff meeting on Musk"
"1764660","1767340"," bid at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. "
"1767340","1769500"," So we have we have mixed signals here."
"1769600","1775140"," It says 2 p.m. now it's saying 5 p.m. So I don't know if this is just bullshit"
"1775140","1775760"," coming out."
"1776460","1779960"," People are trying to muddy the information stream. "
"1780360","1784440"," I see people saying 5 p.m. and see people saying 2 p.m. today."
"1784580","1789240"," So we don't have a definite time at this point."
"1789720","1794620"," I don't know if this is just bears trying to stir some shitpot out there that the meeting will take"
"1794620","1795680"," place after the close. "
"1796580","1799700"," Yeah, wait a minute says 2 p.m. Pacific time."
"1800120","1803240"," That is 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time."
"1803360","1804180"," So after the bell. "
"1804860","1806680"," So maybe I won't place a trade right now."
"1806880","1811880"," I think what I'll do is if it's going to be after the bell, I'll probably probably end up buying"
"1811880","1814980"," some penny calls and penny puts."
"1815360","1819520"," We'll let the interest wear off on Twitter into the 4 p.m. hour. "
"1820340","1822940"," And I'll end up buying something right towards the bell here."
"1823320","1829580"," I'll buy some that's like a penny calls and penny puts for a Monday expiry."
"1830520","1834600"," And I bet one set one side of that trade is going to print by Monday. "
"1835020","1835440"," I don't mind."
"1835580","1836600"," I don't care what the fate is."
"1836800","1837900"," I actually got to think about that. "
"1838060","1841240"," Maybe we'll put on a call and put thread on both sides."
"1841420","1846380"," Maybe we'll burn them because they'll be sell the news kind of a kind of an event in terms of"
"1846380","1847160"," options, right?"
"1847400","1853840"," Maybe we'll get fucked on the on the options unless it's a spread spread doesn't spread."
"1854280","1859620"," It doesn't matter if there's still interest in the trade come Monday, but we'll throw a spread on"
"1859620","1859760"," each. "
"1859960","1861000"," I'll throw a spread on each side."
"1861420","1863240"," That's dirt fucking cheap that won't print."
"1864020","1864640"," We'll just do it. "
"1864780","1869800"," We'll just do a straddle or a strangle type call and put thread so we can get we can get"
"1869800","1871600"," some monetization out of that out of the map."
"1872360","1873060"," Come Monday."
"1873220","1875880"," So we'll monitor Twitter as the day moves forward. "
"1876900","1881440"," We'll put on the hero indicator for Twitter as well."
"1882960","1885760"," Let me change this out to the current order book."
"1886700","1890000"," And let me do some other configure column over here. "
"1891340","1898140"," I'll do an aggregate view and we'll move this over a little bit here so we can look at this."
"1898880","1905540"," We'll take a look at the at the at the see the call volume is is fading now."
"1906060","1910920"," That meeting is being pushed back to aftermarket hours, right?"
"1912240","1913040"," They'll be submit. "
"1913260","1916020"," They'll definitely be some issues with Selva news."
"1916680","1917900"," What am I doing wrong here?"
"1918000","1918740"," I'm doing something wrong."
"1920020","1922280"," Yeah, I figured that over there. "
"1922560","1923140"," Hold on a second here."
"1924500","1925880"," No, I don't want the aggregate."
"1926500","1928060"," I do want the aggregate on that. "
"1928800","1929540"," Close that up."
"1931080","1932920"," And we'll look for some support down here."
"1933000","1937400"," Let's find out where support is on and some price targets heading into tomorrow. "
"1937940","1940920"," We see that there are sellers above at fifty five dollars."
"1943320","1951540"," If the decision is we're not selling, we'll have a price target below of we got forty down here."
"1953780","1956660"," We got thirty down below thirty six. "
"1958960","1960860"," Yeah, I have a price target."
"1961020","1964880"," If the deal falls through, I'd say it's going to go to, I mean, I want to say this, but"
"1964880","1975460"," I'm going to have a price target of I mean, the"
"1975460","1980260"," other thing to those spreads, I'll probably end up putting them out on maybe I'll do an expiry of"
"1980260","1986840"," next Friday, not Monday, just in case they pin it and don't pay anybody."
"1988100","1992700"," But I'd expect thirty bucks by next Friday, believe it or not. "
"1994280","1999100"," And if the deal actually goes through, give me a second here and I'll take a look."
"2001340","2008320"," If the deal goes through, I'm going to put a price target out of a, believe it or not, double,"
"2008460","2009600"," I'll double that price."
"2009600","2014540"," I'll think it'll hit, I'll think it'll hit a, let's look at higher. "
"2016340","2017660"," Believe it or not, I think it'll hit."
"2017840","2021260"," Now, so I'm scratching that when I said about, I think it hit seventy."
"2021740","2022480"," That's my price target. "
"2022780","2025560"," Seventy bucks for roughly thirty."
"2025960","2029620"," It quickly, like it would head down to like thirty five, thirty bucks for a brief moment."
"2030300","2038860"," So I'll look for some put and call spreads expiring Friday for seventy bucks and thirty dollars. "
"2038880","2044660"," I'll price those out, monetize those out, put them out and I'll price them out and see what the"
"2044660","2048260"," cost is versus the chance to win those."
"2052790","2054110"," You see here one other thing."
"2054830","2057929"," And I think you'll have some weakness today too in Twitter now. "
"2058210","2066969"," If that meeting's not taking place until, if that meeting's not taking place until until after"
"2066969","2070750"," market hours today, and that's going to be a tough, that's going to be a tough trade."
"2073170","2079150"," Tough to monetize the zero dates for today if you try to get back into those today."
"2079670","2084389"," Unless some information changes that we don't know about on Twitter. "
"2084610","2088929"," We'll find, I'll try to find out more information or if something leaks maybe."
"2089449","2093530"," I guess we could place a trade here in case there's a least be policymakers back Thursday's"
"2093530","2096130"," decision unanimously, but different on the risks."
"2097130","2103130"," Some policymakers see July hike as still possible after a Thursday's meeting according to sources. "
"2103930","2105890"," Yeah, four thirty threes down there."
"2105930","2107210"," I bet we trade sideways today."
"2109270","2114240"," And then we get weak into the close. "
"2115520","2121140"," Not seeing a whole lot, even on the volume, not a lot of volume today."
"2122020","2123500"," And see that down below here, right?"
"2124520","2131890"," So lots of buyers, as market makers and dealers just buying."
"2134580","2136280"," Okay, we switched over here. "
"2151970","2156110"," It's going to slide up, taking the euro following this press report, citing sources that some"
"2156110","2160810"," policymakers do still see a July hike as possible following today's meeting."
"2162770","2164450"," That's EU, not the US."
"2169260","2173160"," So you can trade this in here between four forty four forty two, if you if you like, right?"
"2173340","2178080"," You can see that you can see how this is trading itself out right by calls by puts by calls"
"2178080","2181700"," by puts short the market here and here and here. "
"2182260","2187640"," I'm going to be I'm not going to take a trade on the spy unless I can get up into"
"2187640","2189240"," this four forty five once more."
"2189240","2193740"," If we can trade up in here, I will throw on some put spreads for next week."
"2194140","2198520"," And otherwise, I'm going to wait for the day to materialize something. "
"2198700","2204600"," I don't see large moves in the market for the rest of the day."
"2204640","2208620"," I think it's going to be kind of a simple day until we get closer to the close."
"2209180","2211000"," I think this was the move over here, right?"
"2211160","2212960"," Right up the bell, huge move in here. "
"2213920","2217420"," There's going to be day trading until we make a move down or move higher."
"2224040","2228160"," We'll close to grab more puts for next week."
"2231500","2233160"," I'll bring this back up and I'll take a look. "
"2233360","2233960"," I'll watch you guys."
"2234160","2236880"," I'm going to check out what you guys are saying in chat right now."
"2240420","2242840"," You can see this support down below here at four forty. "
"2243760","2245400"," Let me see what you guys are saying out there."
"2248280","2249880"," Let's see what you guys are talking about."
"2250600","2252020"," Top chat, live chat. "
"2252800","2252980"," Okay."
"2256060","2257280"," Definitely rejecting the offer."
"2257680","2259980"," If at least grow up a little bit and go through some of the ones above. "
"2261720","2262940"," See you guys are saying up here."
"2265600","2266260"," All right."
"2271700","2273160"," Taxes, I see stuff about taxes. "
"2273440","2275020"," Why don't rotate between indexes and stocks?"
"2275320","2276640"," Well, Winky's in the house today."
"2277060","2277980"," Hey, Winky, good to see you brother."
"2278700","2280000"," I was talking about you yesterday. "
"2281180","2286520"," I didn't know if you were in the stream yesterday or not, Winky, but I was discussing the points"
"2286520","2291100"," that you've made in the past about where you don't actually see what you think you're going to see"
"2291100","2295620"," when we're loaded to the tips on puts at a specific strike."
"2296240","2301660"," Like everybody wants four thousand in May and I don't, my point is you probably won't see four"
"2301660","2302840"," thousand until the week after."
"2303680","2305320"," All at once all that interest comes off. "
"2305580","2307300"," Why not just rotate between indexes and stock?"
"2307540","2307740"," Oh, great."
"2308060","2308620"," You'll burn up yesterday."
"2309320","2309880"," Jim, Captain, everyone. "
"2310040","2310260"," Good morning."
"2311060","2311860"," Gary, good morning."
"2312500","2313500"," Twitter's pushing up again. "
"2314000","2316040"," Of course, I buy calls when fuel used up."
"2317100","2318100"," Good morning, Abraham."
"2318340","2318620"," How are you?"
"2320680","2322140"," Nope, no pump today, supposedly. "
"2322560","2327680"," My guess is that it's going to be my guess is this."
"2328140","2331000"," So on a day like today, this is what I think is going to happen."
"2331660","2333720"," I think this is going to be day traders central. "
"2334460","2337280"," I think this is going to be like five minute trades, five minute trades."
"2337460","2343560"," You'll see some traditional bear and bull flags and you'll see them play out and we'll just fuck"
"2343560","2344140"," around the rest."
"2344300","2347000"," Believe it or not, I think we're going to fuck around the rest of the day and then you'll see"
"2347000","2349020"," some big moves again towards the end of day. "
"2350860","2352000"," It's going to be a slow day today."
"2352580","2353440"," It's a day to start drinking."
"2356400","2359080"," Yeah, the lower trading range chase is next week. "
"2362280","2363220"," Let me see here."
"2363360","2367040"," I demand 445 again or better to start and print my calls."
"2367720","2370000"," I think you might have a chance at 445 today, Chase. "
"2371360","2374960"," I think in traffic today, I don't think we're going to, I think the trading range is going to be"
"2374960","2376380"," very small today."
"2377520","2379440"," 2 p.m. all hands meeting."
"2379840","2384180"," Joshua, can you let me know further down in the chat if it's 2 p.m.? I think it's 2"
"2384180","2386200"," p.m. Pacific time, right?"
"2386320","2389800"," That would make it 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time for New York time. "
"2391480","2393540"," Can you explain the market breath and what it's measuring?"
"2393800","2396420"," Yeah, I'll go through the market breath indicator once more with you here in just a moment."
"2397060","2397840"," Good morning, Brad."
"2398180","2399060"," Good morning, Hada Hada Hut. "
"2400540","2402920"," Why May 18th instead of May 20th?"
"2403980","2404620"," Let's see."
"2405140","2405880"," OPEC's in a month."
"2406700","2408160"," Seems like more of the 20th. "
"2410040","2411340"," Can we see book map?"
"2411580","2412240"," Yep, I did that."
"2414700","2416000"," They're raising fees."
"2416840","2417640"," They're still fucked up. "
"2420720","2422260"," Lowering the cost of the bike too."
"2422680","2424560"," Launching in Walmart near you soon, probably."
"2426760","2431340"," And what usual says Trump is saying you will not return to Twitter even if Elon buys it, oh fucking"
"2431340","2431580"," grace. "
"2433180","2435520"," So is it 2 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for Twitter?"
"2436340","2439160"," I've got someone here saying it's 2 p.m. Pacific time, right?"
"2439340","2441520"," That would make it 5 p.m. Our time, wouldn't it?"
"2441680","2442380"," Is it like three hours?"
"2443260","2444880"," So I think that's what it is."
"2446180","2447420"," Yeah, so Winky's got it right."
"2447580","2448680"," 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. "
"2449940","2455040"," Okay, no, what I'm talking about when I said 2 p.m., I'm looking at Twitter posts that aren't"
"2455040","2455440"," listing."
"2456000","2459320"," They're saying 2 p.m., but they're not saying Pacific Standard Time in their Twitter posts."
"2460140","2463200"," They're intentionally not saying Pacific Standard Time. "
"2470420","2476060"," My point was that when I was reading Twitter posts, people were intentionally not putting Eastern"
"2476060","2478440"," Standard Time or Pacific Standard Time."
"2482840","2485360"," It would stay as far away as possible from that."
"2485560","2488420"," I don't know what that means Twitter puts for next week is the most obvious play ever. "
"2489240","2490900"," I wouldn't agree with that Twitter put."
"2491140","2499880"," So I don't know if you want my, excuse me, if you want my take on it, if his offer"
"2499880","2505200"," is accepted or rejected, I don't know what the answer to that is."
"2506360","2511960"," I don't know if it's accepted or not, but I know that it happens and I know that people get"
"2511960","2512880"," fucking greedy. "
"2513440","2516800"," And the other neat part is that it could still come back to being public again."
"2517500","2519260"," This could just be a lot of flop."
"2519320","2521980"," I know there's talk of that on Twitter right now that it's just bullshit. "
"2523680","2526440"," So puts are the obvious answer for next week."
"2526780","2527020"," Got it."
"2528600","2531660"," It's by bear flagging or coming back to test VWAP today. "
"2531900","2532180"," Not sure."
"2532300","2532980"," I'll take a look again."
"2534060","2539720"," Ben Long Twitter puts since initial pump, the three close may 40 already, 48% polling. "
"2540040","2540960"," We're inside 15 minutes now."
"2541080","2545780"," The European cash equity close, European rates remain higher on the day and higher than we were,"
"2546100","2549140"," we're about where we were heading into the ECB statement this morning."
"2549600","2554560"," Oh, I see we're saying 10 year yield of seven, the Italian 10 year up 11, the UK 10 year"
"2554560","2555820"," up eight on the day. "
"2556600","2557840"," You have no fucking night."
"2558240","2560060"," A small pop here in the euro."
"2560060","2566700"," We cooping some of the day's losses post ECB 10814 on that latest ECB source story as we head"
"2566700","2568060"," towards the European cash close. "
"2569580","2571000"," Yeah, I have no idea at the times."
"2571600","2572220"," All right."
"2572360","2574960"," The taxes higher by about tens of a percent. "
"2575040","2577920"," The cat con up for tens of a percent as we push towards the close."
"2580840","2585900"," I think my assumption though is that after market hours, if it was in market hours that that the"
"2585900","2590620"," meeting took place and someone was on the inside and we'll watch the options chain today."
"2590860","2596580"," My assumption is that there's probably insiders that are going to place some bets at some point. "
"2596580","2601220"," And if we can keep an eye on the options chain on Twitter, we can see the insider trades that"
"2601220","2603120"," are going on behind the scenes."
"2603500","2604760"," So we'll look for that too in Twitter."
"2606760","2609160"," At some point, at some point, they might see that leaking. "
"2613580","2615260"," Yeah, tack, I agree with you on that."
"2625350","2627370"," Just taking profits and anticipation."
"2628290","2629810"," Well, I missed the part you guys are saying. "
"2631350","2632690"," I'm missing some of your stuff here."
"2632870","2633090"," Hold on."
"2636610","2639810"," I bought you bought the Twitter 38 with me. "
"2639990","2640630"," You didn't sell them."
"2640830","2642470"," Yeah, I sold at 52 cents."
"2642950","2645550"," When we put that first pop, I sold them for 50 cents. "
"2646810","2648130"," Where are they at right now?"
"2648410","2648830"," Are they still?"
"2649970","2652990"," Well, let's take a look."
"2653210","2653970"," We look at Twitter."
"2663310","2665990"," So, oh, shit, 50 Cs are only worth 12 cents now. "
"2666370","2666850"," Fuck in a."
"2669090","2674290"," Yeah, so now that they know that there's not going to be a decision today, my assumption would be"
"2674290","2678090"," that all of the options for today are going to get fucked."
"2678430","2684090"," If I had to guess and it might dip even further, you could offset your trade by getting some puts,"
"2684310","2690190"," but my thought process would be that they're going to burn down at least the call side on Twitter"
"2690190","2692950"," today with that meeting now being after market hours."
"2695270","2699290"," If Twitter board is going to even consider my software, they will certainly counter. "
"2699770","2701290"," Stock was in 60, six months ago."
"2701790","2702750"," What happens to the price?"
"2702770","2703450"," Good question, Greg."
"2704010","2710610"," I think the price goes up to I honestly, from I took a minute before this broadcast to look at"
"2710610","2713230"," public companies that have gone private. "
"2713790","2718330"," And if that decision is made, I'm telling you, expect a double in the price."
"2718870","2724910"," Expect like, I mean, my price target is 70, but I wouldn't blink if we went to 78 or 80"
"2724910","2725150"," bucks."
"2725150","2727570"," It absolutely would not blink. "
"2727810","2734150"," I wouldn't blink if it went higher because of the market's been the craziness that we've had this"
"2734150","2737670"," market the past couple of years, right?"
"2737830","2741610"," The retail traders that are in the market, the meme stonks and all that kind of stuff that goes on"
"2741610","2742670"," this market wouldn't shock me."
"2743870","2748590"," So I agree, Greg, 10 years approaching 2.8 again."
"2748930","2749730"," They would never just accept. "
"2751110","2752830"," Yeah, I don't think they would just accept that."
"2752830","2755290"," I think they would negotiate a price if they were going to accept."
"2756150","2761550"," But you guys got to know that some very famous companies have gone private. "
"2762550","2764790"," Some very famous companies get bought."
"2765010","2768970"," It's not out of the realm of possibility that it could happen."
"2769290","2770110"," There's a chance, right?"
"2770570","2775950"," There's a greater chance than there was yesterday that Elon Musk can buy Twitter. "
"2776390","2781590"," And I'm not saying that it's a guaranteed thing or trying to put a hey, this is going to happen."
"2782330","2783910"," My only concern is making money."
"2784170","2789210"," So if I put a put and a call spread on it, it's got more than likely it's going to"
"2789210","2789770"," print, right?"
"2789950","2791630"," We're either going to sell the fuck out of Twitter. "
"2792790","2798350"," And actually, you'll see the other neat part of that trade is you'll probably see from what I read"
"2798350","2803430"," this morning, you'll probably see if the deal goes through or if the deal doesn't go through,"
"2803830","2806370"," you'll actually see Tesla crank."
"2807010","2808490"," You'll see Tesla end up cranking."
"2808710","2817550"," So I guess if you're in the camp of buying puts on Twitter for next week, there's a couple of"
"2817550","2818310"," problems with that. "
"2818490","2819770"," First, it's just like an ER, right?"
"2819970","2825670"," If you sell the news over the weekend, you might not lose all the monetization of your puts"
"2825670","2829550"," realizing that because there's so much interest right now, right?"
"2829550","2830910"," The interest go will go next week."
"2831090","2832050"," So I would stick with spreads."
"2832950","2838990"," And the other thing, though, too, is if you're bearish on Twitter, the deal falling through, I"
"2838990","2841850"," would then want to buy some calls from Monday. "
"2842570","2846650"," Even if the market's going to head down on Monday, I would buy in some calls on Tesla, I guess."
"2847310","2851750"," I don't know if the market, if there's still rotation on Monday, if the market doesn't start"
"2851750","2856210"," selling off immediately, you'd probably see Tesla up, even if the market's kind of like rotating"
"2856210","2856550"," still."
"2857010","2860550"," If the market's going down in a hole, it might just be an excuse to keep dropping Tesla. "
"2862310","2867070"," But there could be a trade in Tesla, possibly going up with the deal falling through."
"2872650","2874070"," Let me see you guys are saying here."
"2875690","2876590"," Oh, my bad. "
"2877030","2879270"," 69.420 brother."
"2879830","2880610"," My bad."
"2880650","2881270"," My bad, Josh. "
"2881430","2881750"," My bad."
"2881750","2882870"," My bad dog."
"2883810","2886170"," Two 10 years approaching 2.8 again. "
"2887870","2893970"," Yeah, there's a long conversation we have to have about a 10 year, 10s and twos."
"2895910","2896990"," Not for today."
"2898670","2901830"," It's impact on the market, what it means to the market. "
"2902530","2905770"," Uh, no, it would not double."
"2905770","2907290"," It would go to four 54 20."
"2907970","2908790"," Why would it go to?"
"2909150","2910530"," Why would it go to 54 20?"
"2912290","2916930"," Oh, no, you're saying it would go to 54 20 because of the offer price?"
"2917670","2918970"," Uh, no, incorrect. "
"2920170","2920790"," That's incorrect."
"2921550","2923130"," It doesn't go to the offer price."
"2923790","2926090"," I want to be clear with that, whether you know this or not. "
"2926190","2927710"," If you don't know this out there, right?"
"2928270","2933630"," The top is not what the offer that's made is by the end of the close of the deal being"
"2933630","2936810"," made, uh, the price can go wherever the fuck it wants to go."
"2937710","2938450"," Be clear on that."
"2938570","2938770"," Okay. "
"2939610","2941770"," Be very, very, very clear on that."
"2942270","2946310"," Uh, Greek and rocket just saying if they had, uh, they had no, if they say no to the offer,"
"2946310","2949410"," they were probably saying business lingo will get back to you."
"2949410","2949510"," Yeah. "
"2951290","2955910"," There will always be a big will there dumping shares at 54 20."
"2956010","2956890"," If the offer is accepted."
"2957830","2963910"," Uh, you know, you know, I can, I can get what you're saying about the big will selling at 54"
"2963910","2964390"," 20. "
"2964590","2968870"," What I'm going to say to you is, uh, go out there, dig through on Google."
"2969370","2972910"," Just, I don't know, do a Google search that says, uh, cut, I think Dell did it."
"2973050","2978530"," I think Dell went pub or was public when private Burger King was public and then went private. "
"2978790","2979730"," There's a few others, right?"
"2980550","2985970"," Uh, but some big ones like big companies like Twitter go look at what their stock price, their"
"2985970","2990390"," share price was, uh, at the end of the day of the deal being made an agreed upon, and they're"
"2990390","2992330"," agreed upon deal deals that they had."
"2992510","2994170"," They, they just cranked, they cranked right into the bell."
"2997640","3000220"," So not, not saying that's going to happen here with Twitter. "
"3000720","3004040"," I'm saying that I'm looking for examples in the past."
"3004380","3006280"," Did it go to the offer price at the bell?"
"3006460","3007340"," Did it go higher?"
"3007560","3008080"," Did it go lower?"
"3009000","3013360"," And history tells us that it goes way, way higher if the deal goes through."
"3013360","3017520"," I think Tesla would, uh, go down significantly as well. "
"3019560","3021280"," Uh, let me see it where you can rock it."
"3021700","3022860"," There will always be a big well."
"3023080","3023140"," Yeah. "
"3024220","3027580"," I'm assuming what, uh, let me have a listen something."
"3028720","3029340"," Hold on."
"3030480","3033500"," Assuming a Toyota or a power company gets bought up for those of shared doubles. "
"3034560","3036340"," Uh, there may be no finality."
"3036360","3038060"," Uh, yes, no next week."
"3038240","3038960"," That's a fair point, Craig. "
"3039220","3039820"," I agree with that too."
"3040900","3045780"," Uh, Chick-fil-A, no reason for it to go through the wheels was shorted, had lived above 5420."
"3046460","3049420"," Investors will sell if, saw it above that price. "
"3050200","3051740"," Uh, Tesla ER and 422."
"3052460","3052620"," Yep."
"3053360","3053920"," Uh, why not?"
"3054320","3055120"," Hey, man, I missed some. "
"3055280","3056360"," Mineo Ripper today."
"3056640","3061500"," If negative gamma is rolling off, uh, we'll get to that answer, Chase in just a minute."
"3061840","3063820"," Of course it can go higher, but it likely won't. "
"3064140","3066100"," Uh, you said it could double."
"3066920","3068900"," Uh, yeah, I think it can fucking double easily."
"3069700","3070680"," And you know what?"
"3070980","3071940"," You show me. "
"3072360","3072760"," How about this?"
"3072760","3074400"," Let's, let's talk about this real quick."
"3075780","3077060"," You get your ass."
"3077520","3082460"," You get yourself on Google and you show me when this has happened in the past, and these, you know,"
"3083080","3084520"," like comparable, uh, company. "
"3085160","3089400"," I don't think Burger King comparable to what it kind of is, but find those companies and you show"
"3089400","3090720"," me where that hasn't happened."
"3091000","3092700"," It's very common for this to happen."
"3093300","3099080"," Um, uh, to close, to close almost double, uh, into their back to the bell once the agreement is"
"3099080","3099280"," found. "
"3100620","3102340"," Chase will get back to the no Ripper today."
"3103080","3104940"," Um, look at five and trees."
"3104940","3110100"," Brad has to be inverted for period time for negative effects for my tops in the past. "
"3110340","3111080"," Uh, Floyd's garage."
"3111500","3119840"," If you guys want, uh, I will do a video on the impact of the credit markets on the cash"
"3119840","3120200"," market."
"3122300","3130680"," Um, my take on the market right now is, uh, we've heard my take on the market. "
"3130980","3133580"," Uh, I, I regurgitated every single day."
"3133720","3135040"," I'm sticking with that right now."
"3136360","3139680"," Uh, who's buying put her higher than 5420?"
"3140140","3143020"," There'll always be a seller higher, uh, Panera. "
"3143940","3144380"," Yep."
"3144600","3147280"," Panera bread was one must cult would follow."
"3147620","3150900"," It would go higher than the average price, but I would give it less than 10% chance they accept"
"3150900","3151380"," the offer. "
"3151860","3157320"," I kind of like what he's saying, right?"
"3157460","3158620"," Most cult will follow it."
"3159240","3160160"," Uh, it will."
"3160320","3161180"," It'll, it'll blast off. "
"3161360","3162040"," I'm just, just promise."
"3162240","3162840"," I promise you."
"3162920","3163060"," Okay. "
"3163400","3168760"," You saw Tesla week, you were Tesla was weak this morning, and Twitter was up just based on that,"
"3168860","3168960"," right?"
"3169560","3171060"," Uh, I think you see it blast off."
"3172580","3174560"," Time to convert about 15 yesterday."
"3175560","3180840"," Uh, space call for was on Twitter or wrong telling folks share price pegged at 5420. "
"3180980","3181140"," Yeah."
"3181280","3183380"," Like the peg that 5420, it's fucking retarded."
"3187180","3188480"," Tesla goes lower if accepted. "
"3188800","3188920"," Yep."
"3189000","3189360"," Absolutely."
"3190080","3193020"," Question is, Twitter willing to give up their controls to control you. "
"3193180","3194880"," You know, that's not really the question for me, Dan."
"3195060","3196000"," I got to tell you guys something."
"3196220","3196420"," Okay. "
"3196780","3200820"," If you guys have been in the market for a long fucking time, I've seen fucking more shit."
"3201780","3202140"," Shit."
"3202360","3204620"," Like everyone's a fucking bully. "
"3204860","3207220"," I mean, are the CEOs of these companies, right?"
"3207880","3210100"," These companies, you know, is a prime example."
"3210880","3212240"," It's a prime fucking example."
"3212880","3214460"," Go back, right?"
"3215180","3219460"," Go back and remember the CEO of Peton. "
"3219700","3220820"," This is a recent example."
"3221080","3225860"," Go back and just look at the fucking CEO of Peton and all the fucking videos he used to make,"
"3225860","3229520"," uh, stroking off about where he's taking the company, right?"
"3230620","3235760"," And then you see what's leaked out heading into their last DR there, right?"
"3236340","3239660"," And what were they doing during, uh, COVID?"
"3241040","3246460"," They were fucking snorting cocaine fucking hookers for two years partying at ski resorts."
"3246720","3247880"," I skied during COVID. "
"3248020","3248820"," They're packed."
"3249480","3250260"," Rich people are on the mountain."
"3250480","3251320"," That's what they were doing. "
"3251520","3252840"," Rich people are on the mountain during COVID."
"3252900","3259240"," All up on the ECB thinking importantly, he said to be seeing a growing consensus for a 25 base"
"3259240","3261280"," point rate increase in the third quarter."
"3261880","3263000"," They were partying down in Florida. "
"3263560","3269000"," I can tell you right now, earlier reports that these people make or see a July rate hike is still"
"3269000","3271100"," possible after today's meeting."
"3272020","3278820"," And in some members, my point is that over the risk assessment that the CEO is saying that he's"
"3278820","3279980"," doing all this shit, right?"
"3280800","3286200"," And then he comes out with a fucking armband after two years of just cranking money into piton."
"3286480","3292020"," And you when you're saying to yourself, like, I'm, I'm not, I'm not a fucking engineer for Peton. "
"3292280","3296480"," But I know if I was a CEO of Peton, what's the next logical step for Peton?"
"3296960","3297260"," What is it?"
"3297920","3299120"," You guys tell me, I know what it is."
"3299560","3303600"," You buy a fucking, you buy a kick ass bike company high end, right?"
"3304140","3306300"," Because that's who buys pitons, right?"
"3306880","3312420"," You know, Mandy lives, you know, that's fucked up commercial where the husband works and the wife"
"3312420","3313440"," works out all day long."
"3313960","3314580"," So fucked up. "
"3315120","3318620"," But anyways, they're catering to like that apple crowd, right?"
"3319140","3324900"," And if we're gonna reopen at some point, you would expect that they would have a fucking piton bike"
"3324900","3332260"," for Jim Bob and his wife to go bike riding on, you'd expect something more with more oomph for that"
"3332260","3332560"," company."
"3332820","3333480"," And what do they do?"
"3333660","3334380"," What did the CEO do?"
"3334640","3336720"," He was fucking around doing nothing."
"3337140","3340720"," And so like, I know that you're like, Hey, Twitter would never sell out. "
"3340720","3344880"," And you know, you see like the like the board's never going to sell out."
"3345080","3346900"," I'm telling you behind closed doors, right?"
"3347800","3352600"," It's fucking rare to find a CEO that believes you saw it in Boeing, right?"
"3352780","3355720"," There was a time when Boeing was, you saw it, that grant just came out right?"
"3355960","3357240"," Boeing was known for quality."
"3357620","3363080"," And then they got trading in Europe is now officially closed for the day, the DAX up three quarters"
"3363080","3366240"," of a percent, the cat caron up nine tens of a percent on the day. "
"3367420","3369020"," You see this time and again, right?"
"3369120","3372300"," You see like an Elon Musk that believes in this company, whether you think he's a fraud or not, it"
"3372300","3372700"," doesn't matter."
"3372760","3374780"," Where you see like an Elon Musk, like I'll never fucking sell."
"3375200","3381160"," I'll tell you what, most companies behind the fucking doors will fucking sell their wife, their"
"3381160","3387780"," kids, their dogs, they'll sell everything to monetize or to to print money for their company. "
"3388540","3390900"," So, so I wouldn't fucking put it past them for a minute."
"3391460","3394200"," Do people or companies do this all the fucking time?"
"3394760","3399700"," And they'll they'll lie to your face and then and then pull a rug out from underneath you at some"
"3399700","3404220"," point, unannounced, shocking, a deal has been made, it's been sold, they've brought in a partner,"
"3404680","3406620"," all kinds of nonsense happens with these companies."
"3406980","3411220"," So, I'm not saying it's going to happen if they're going to accept the bid, but it wouldn't shock"
"3411220","3411440"," me. "
"3411740","3415520"," I heard all the talk to where people are like, well, we don't want to be controlled by Elon Musk."
"3416760","3417700"," We don't want to have that."
"3417940","3419720"," We'll quit all this other fucking nonsense. "
"3421040","3429620"," I'll tell you what, if the money is right, most people have a price that they'll sell at, if the"
"3429620","3430220"," money is right."
"3432360","3434160"," Well, I'm not saying it's going to happen."
"3434260","3437020"," Okay, I'm not telling you like, I believe that the deal is going to take place. "
"3437180","3442380"," I'm just telling you the argument of, you know, will the will the board won't sit with it or any"
"3442380","3446940"," of like the talk that you hear, it's always all muscles of the treasury is really an easy bill"
"3446940","3447260"," auction."
"3449990","3454510"," Yeah, Twitter deal would be a huge stock market saying earlier close to two o'clock eastern out of"
"3454510","3455570"," the good Friday holiday."
"3456770","3461360"," Yeah, yeah, do I get what you're saying, Dan?"
"3461540","3463220"," I understand the semantics of it. "
"3463940","3468240"," You're saying I don't think Twitter's ready to give up and control to Elon, not that it can't"
"3468240","3468460"," double."
"3468680","3470460"," I don't, I wasn't agreeing just with any of that."
"3470600","3474220"," I was trying to explain to you that that sentiment, right?"
"3474880","3481140"," Four week bills draw 0.370% with 81.75% a lot at the high and a 2.84."
"3481400","3482480"," Yellow covers today, Zach. "
"3483500","3484860"," I like a condor to Zach."
"3488720","3496800"," I'm not trying to say like eight week bills draw 0.570% with 49.27% a lot at"
"3496800","3501660"," the high and a bid to cover a 3.56. That's weird."
"3502020","3511100"," So I spent I spent a portion of my career working in corporate America and I started out moving my"
"3511100","3511920"," way up and then I was in. "
"3512840","3514300"," Oh, hold on one second here."
"3514520","3515340"," Can we just click second here?"
"3525120","3529600"," So I spent a portion of my career working in corporate America, right?"
"3529600","3539120"," And over time I worked my way up in these companies and eventually I made my way into C-suite,"
"3539140","3539240"," right?"
"3539520","3540880"," Can you have plugged this in please for me?"
"3542740","3543400"," Right there."
"3547570","3554590"," And then doing business deals closed door meetings, right?"
"3554950","3559490"," So when you get into business, I know some of you have been in business before. "
"3560470","3564790"," I'll tell you what, I'll tell you like fucking 80% of the people I've done business with."
"3566030","3568590"," They have a face for their employees."
"3568850","3569950"," They have a face for their management. "
"3570310","3572050"," They have a face for their upper management."
"3572630","3575810"," And then the moment you're in a back fucking room with these guys, right?"
"3575990","3577750"," I'm not saying this is right or wrong or what?"
"3577930","3582090"," I don't, you know, I'm not trying to make past judgment here, but I'm saying that I'm telling you."
"3583530","3587730"," They say it doesn't go on, but behind closed doors, right?"
"3588150","3590230"," It's like a, it's like a, it's like a fucking fifth face. "
"3590230","3595410"," When you hear that CEOs are psychopaths or whatever they cut, you know, they say that a lot of CEOs"
"3595410","3596690"," are like, I'm telling you, they fucking are."
"3597510","3598490"," They're psychopathic."
"3598690","3601190"," You get them ahead of closed door with depending on who they're talking to. "
"3601690","3606950"," And they'll sell their fucking mother down the fucking river in a fucking second."
"3607150","3607990"," They're fucking monsters."
"3608610","3609050"," That's what they are. "
"3609170","3611470"," Over the mid my experience, at least, not all of them."
"3611770","3615590"," Like not, do not you, you might be out there and own some small business and you're not that guy."
"3616030","3618630"," But I'm telling you on a larger scale, right?"
"3619110","3622430"," There are some ruthless fucking people in business. "
"3622750","3623650"," And that's why they're in business."
"3623870","3625090"," That's why they're where they are."
"3626390","3628110"," So I don't think it's off the tape. "
"3628330","3634090"," So let's say, let's say I was going to make a deal for Twitter and my employees weren't happy with"
"3634090","3634450"," it, right?"
"3634690","3635690"," I would massage you publicly."
"3636310","3639210"," I would have a PR team out there saying we're going to swage your concerns."
"3639490","3639990"," We're going to do this. "
"3640270","3648870"," We're going to be reading news articles or a push from it."
"3649010","3655030"," There's probably PR right now being spread around about this very thing being paid for right now."
"3655410","3656310"," Probably believe it or not. "
"3656550","3659630"," So that if a Twitter employee reads it, he feels better or she feels better."
"3659870","3662170"," Believe it or not, that shit goes on all the time."
"3663170","3664510"," Whether you know it or not. "
"3664730","3665970"," That really does happen."
"3666730","3668810"," In case the deal goes through, right?"
"3669190","3675490"," Well, at least they aired my opinions publicly on Twitter or on Fox News or on CNN."
"3676630","3677510"," I feel better. "
"3677810","3679390"," It's kind of a fucked up thing, right?"
"3679590","3680670"," But it's a psychological thing."
"3681270","3686730"," People get paid a lot of money to put those stories out so that you kind of feel better in"
"3686730","3687110"," some way."
"3687150","3687830"," It's really fucked up. "
"3687970","3689490"," But that does happen all the time."
"3689750","3694570"," So I don't think for a minute that they won't, I don't think that they won't consider the offer."
"3694610","3695650"," I think they will consider it. "
"3695650","3697510"," They're having this meeting, right?"
"3697810","3700750"," You don't, the CEO didn't just come out and say, fuck you now, right?"
"3701290","3702710"," So they're having a meeting on it."
"3702950","3706310"," So they're at least entertaining this offer."
"3710290","3715890"," ATV Misfit Deal is a great example of price non-hyper inflating on buyout. "
"3718210","3722390"," Sellers at 443 to density."
"3723630","3725590"," Goes the company down because it uses a piece of shit."
"3726410","3727090"," I miss you too, Sue. "
"3727290","3727750"," How are you?"
"3728470","3729030"," Shut it."
"3729310","3729810"," Shut it."
"3730490","3733650"," Yeah, they're fucking monsters, man. "
"3733790","3734930"," Behind closed doors of telling you."
"3739860","3741380"," I don't know if I believe that."
"3743220","3747180"," Well, the reason I'm bringing this up, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up to you guys is"
"3747180","3751540"," because I didn't know like, like, so you think you know somebody. "
"3752280","3757460"," I mean, some of these guys, you'd meet him and you fucking would never know."
"3757700","3759180"," And then you get behind a closed door."
"3759240","3761600"," It comes down to signing a deal behind a closed door. "
"3762120","3766720"," And you fucking find out you're like, motherfucker, this guy's another fucking scumbag."
"3766900","3772120"," And you're just like, no matter you go in a boat ride with him, you go fucking golfing with him,"
"3772120","3775960"," you go have a drink with him, you eat steak with him 10 times, all this other stupid shit that"
"3775960","3776300"," happens."
"3776800","3779260"," And then you get behind a closed door and you're like, do the fucking monster. "
"3779700","3780840"," No fucking guys a fucking monster."
"3781220","3786700"," As a matter of fact, I left my chosen career path because I had gotten to a point where I"
"3786700","3788660"," was going to have to become a monster."
"3789420","3793200"," And I, this is I shit, you know, I was talking to a donut about this. "
"3794560","3799020"," That one, I was talking to a donut at one point about this, because I was offered a job where"
"3799020","3807260"," a position where I'd be working between South America and North America, traveling constantly up"
"3807260","3809220"," and down the East Coast, then down to Columbia's."
"3809440","3810100"," Great job, right?"
"3810700","3815220"," I would never be home ever, like maybe home, like once a month or so, right?"
"3815340","3819560"," It'd be home once a month, but I'd be out, you know, eating steak out and drinking fucking bourbon"
"3819560","3826140"," every night and blowing cocaine and fucking fucking hookers and stuff like that or whatever."
"3826560","3827520"," That's what those guys do. "
"3827780","3830080"," And not the all of them, but a lot of them do this, right?"
"3830300","3832500"," This is the life for a lot of a lot of people."
"3832700","3835260"," And I wasn't willing to do that."
"3835660","3841860"," I gave up a huge job, a huge salary because I didn't want to become that. "
"3842040","3843140"," I didn't want to stay married."
"3843140","3844520"," I wanted to be with my kids."
"3844840","3848040"," I wanted, I enjoy my family. "
"3848740","3853360"," And so I didn't want to have that life, you know, but that life is out there for a lot"
"3853360","3853720"," of people."
"3855520","3859860"," Once I was exposed to it, I was like, ah, man, I was like, I don't want anything to do"
"3859860","3860660"," with this stuff, right?"
"3861040","3862600"," And you can see what the class is."
"3862600","3866800"," You can see that this is very common in this lifestyle. "
"3867320","3868120"," But it wasn't for me."
"3868360","3871000"," I got, I was married at that point and I just had two young children."
"3871440","3872260"," And I'm like, you know what?"
"3873040","3876740"," I'm like, I'd rather not become what I would. "
"3876840","3878480"," I see these other guys have become, right?"
"3879260","3881840"," These, all these guys are in their fifties are on the second third divorce."
"3881940","3885960"," They got a fake blonde bimbo with fake tits, or they're just single, right?"
"3886600","3888920"," And they got couple kids that divorce or two behind them."
"3888920","3890720"," And they're always in the road. "
"3891140","3893320"," And, um, I didn't want anything to do with it."
"3898900","3900420"," We're in Silicon Valley for decades."
"3900560","3901340"," Cap is right. "
"3902000","3902000"," Yeah."
"3903840","3905140"," Cap for us to hate the news."
"3909980","3914400"," Yeah, Twitter's a propaganda tool by the CIA, the Chinese and Saudis. "
"3915020","3917300"," They will accept giving up the tool for some money."
"3920780","3921800"," I like you, Nat."
"3922420","3923200"," Nat and Y, Jen. "
"3923520","3923920"," Thanks, brother."
"3925960","3927720"," Shouldn't took on the 15 minute looks like too long."
"3927900","3928860"," We don't be a bear flag anymore. "
"3928920","3929920"," It just looks like a trading range."
"3929920","3930460"," You've entered it."
"3930660","3931760"," Yeah, we're in a trading range. "
"3931880","3932300"," That's what we're in."
"3932500","3933600"," So I'm going to tell you guys for sure."
"3933600","3933900"," Okay. "
"3933900","3933900"," Okay."
"3941720","3942680"," Limp dick diagrams."
"3945820","3946440"," Why what?"
"3946760","3953700"," So the thing that I'm not going to tell you what I used to do, but I was the guy"
"3953700","3955780"," that you'd bring into a failing operation, right?"
"3956100","3959880"," So if you had a failing operation, I was the fucking Hatcherman. "
"3960460","3962700"," I'd come in and I would fucking hatch at you."
"3964240","3967260"," And replace your ass from altitude of reasons."
"3970400","3973820"," So yeah, I was pretty, pretty blunt with people. "
"3974080","3975880"," I was going monster, whatever."
"3978020","3979080"," They will sell their brother."
"3979240","3979600"," Yeah, they will. "
"3980740","3982060"," Probably already got to Elon."
"3982520","3984200"," CIA's already probably already got to Elon."
"3986900","3988920"," Yeah, you can confirm on regarding CEO. "
"3989100","3989760"," They can promise you guys."
"3989960","3991200"," I'm telling you behind closed doors, dude."
"3991300","3992660"," These guys, it's not all of them. "
"3992920","3997680"," You know, there's like companies that have real people behind them, that real believers."
"3998120","4000180"," I mean, Boeing was one of those companies at one time."
"4000420","4002900"," GE was one of those companies at one time, right?"
"4003240","4008380"," Joe and Joe and I were talking about this couple weeks ago, we were saying they bring in, they"
"4008380","4013380"," bring in new leadership or they get a corporate, they have rated a corporate raider comes in, and"
"4013380","4014840"," they cut all the fat, they cut out people. "
"4015520","4017360"," You know, you saw that you saw this one guy, right?"
"4017420","4019060"," I forget what what a company was."
"4019480","4020140"," That wasn't we work."
"4020540","4024080"," But he was he did like he was laying people off via zoom calls, right?"
"4024460","4025760"," These people have no fucking tact. "
"4026080","4028540"," They have no fucking tone death."
"4030220","4032300"," And they'll and they'll fucking sell you down the river."
"4032420","4036640"," Like you'd be working somewhere for 20 years, 30 years, and they'll sell you down a fucking river. "
"4037460","4043820"," If the if that original leader doesn't still believe in their company or gets too old or the or the"
"4043820","4046580"," money's right, they don't believe anymore."
"4047300","4048340"," There's all kinds of reasons."
"4049320","4050180"," You lose the money. "
"4050940","4055680"," We already know behind the closed doors of Twitter that they haven't been able to monetize it"
"4055680","4056760"," properly, right?"
"4057020","4059860"," We don't know behind the scenes about Twitter."
"4060720","4066400"," If they can monetize it or if they lose what the the specialness of where there is a special that"
"4066400","4069600"," may I was talking to my wife about this last night, I was like, I was like, you know what?"
"4069960","4071420"," I was like, you know what?"
"4071580","4074540"," I was like, I I've been I was an early adopter of Reddit."
"4075440","4080880"," Like the early like first year it was open like first when it was like brand new when they were"
"4080880","4083300"," faking posts and all that kind of shit and faking comments. "
"4083640","4084340"," I was a Redditor."
"4085480","4088200"," And I've seen it's changed over the years, right?"
"4088720","4089860"," It involved quote unquote."
"4090120","4094680"," But I was talking to my wife about Reddit last night and I was saying, I was talking about excuse"
"4094680","4096160"," me, I was talking to my wife last night about Reddit. "
"4096160","4100880"," And I was saying, I was saying, look, I was like, I've seen every iteration of Reddit."
"4101399","4106979"," I was like, but at this point, seeing it from its inception to what it is today, in my view,"
"4107520","4107640"," right?"
"4108000","4110140"," It's completely astroturbed."
"4110840","4111380"," Completely. "
"4113819","4118640"," There's a there's there's an opinion being pushed and sold and bought on Reddit."
"4119120","4121920"," And then there's even massive control."
"4122920","4124240"," And they flush accounts. "
"4124479","4129760"," I've had I've had I've been IP Dan from Reddit over the years have had a long time accounts I've"
"4129760","4130840"," had gotten I've gotten burned."
"4131270","4136560"," You can see that there are trust commentators they can even even mods can even structure comment"
"4136560","4139840"," sections to look a certain way specifically intentionally."
"4142000","4146080"," Companies astrotur governments astrotur in Reddit. "
"4146420","4152160"," And then now you can even see the way that comment sections are there's even I'm not against"
"4152160","4158060"," foreign people making comments in threads but inside of comment sections."
"4158340","4165939"," But you can see that there's more of a global more of a global influence in Reddit, which is fine."
"4166040","4166700"," I'm fine with that. "
"4166979","4171880"," But at the same time, it's not it's not it's not really real."
"4171880","4177600"," Like if I was to go to let's say India and try to say this if these are my values,"
"4177600","4179819"," right, you'd be laughing stock."
"4180140","4186180"," So if you've got a if you've got a government entity trying to persuade Americans or English people"
"4186180","4193360"," or Americans here with with viewpoints and thoughts that aren't American, what you're doing is"
"4193360","4199320"," you're kind of you're kind of it's almost like a psychological warfare to an extent. "
"4199940","4201940"," And to me, I don't like Reddit anymore."
"4202300","4209980"," And I know that that happens on Twitter, but it's harder to find it's harder to find quality"
"4209980","4211080"," information on Reddit."
"4211440","4213400"," It seems like it's all crafted at this point. "
"4214460","4216420"," Mostly Reddit is astrotur."
"4216620","4220140"," On Twitter, you'll hear you'll see you'll see the Russians and the Chinese and all this kind of"
"4220140","4223060"," stuff in the bots and all this other shit."
"4223140","4226880"," But then you can actually still find legit sources on Twitter, right?"
"4227040","4230920"," Twitter shares a phone in the negative territory on the day now at 45 55. "
"4231600","4233020"," You can follow Trump or Biden."
"4233040","4235880"," You can follow a reporter from the New York Times."
"4235880","4243700"," You can follow the guy who runs, I don't know, full algo or follow the guy that runs spot gamma. "
"4244480","4248520"," And you actually follow these people for the for true insight from the horse's mouth."
"4249320","4251200"," Oftentimes on Reddit, I don't find that."
"4251300","4252780"," So we were talking about that last night about Twitter. "
"4253500","4259660"," And then also Reddit was able to monetize and Twitter hasn't been able to monetize yet at this"
"4259660","4259860"," point."
"4259960","4266260"," So we don't know behind the behind the scenes if a new ownership will help monetize Twitter at this"
"4266260","4266520"," point."
"4267540","4271620"," And so I'm questioning that if the deal could go through over that as well. "
"4272680","4276800"," So in my view, I'm just thinking I'm thinking a lot about Twitter effect deal could actually go"
"4276800","4276980"," through."
"4281320","4283000"," Yeah, they're letting you know the real deal."
"4283660","4284880"," The other psychopaths, absolutely. "
"4289060","4290420"," Yep, all employees just numbers."
"4290720","4295900"," So you got to know that spot gamma was really way off."
"4296080","4297760"," Okay, Chase, we're going to get to you here in just a second. "
"4297840","4300500"," I see you keep freaking out inside the chat box."
"4303610","4305470"," Chase thinks it's a major dump incoming."
"4307170","4310130"," The chairs against the wall, the CEO of factory folks. "
"4310670","4311950"," Looks like they're going to break spy."
"4312310","4313470"," Okay, stop panicking."
"4315430","4316750"," John has a long mustache. "
"4317190","4318430"," John has a long mustache."
"4320410","4325950"," Yeah, it's all yeah, it's Reddit has become a shit show."
"4326350","4328710"," It is a fucking shit show. "
"4329490","4332710"," And even like Wall Street butts still claims that they're not they're not carpet."
"4333170","4334990"," They're not asked for turf and they are too."
"4335610","4339830"," I remember I've been every iteration I've seen while I've been in Wall Street butts for years and"
"4339830","4340210"," years and years. "
"4340230","4342170"," He's be a very active member there."
"4342450","4346730"," And even even that sub is fucked up way five."
"4346790","4349830"," It's more fucked up from the mods than anything else. "
"4350910","4351870"," Even the current mods."
"4351990","4355190"," I know you guys love the current mods but that the whole thing's a scam."
"4356730","4361750"," So anyways, okay, so we're going to talk about we're going to go back to Chase's panic and air. "
"4361790","4363210"," So we're going to go back to spot gamma report."
"4363390","4363430"," Okay."
"4363850","4366730"," And everything is lining up to what they said today. "
"4367210","4372130"," There's there's nothing everything they said today is lining up to what's taking place."
"4372410","4373630"," So we'll go through it one more time."
"4375250","4379670"," So with you read it on your own or something that I read these with you every day so that"
"4379670","4382050"," you guys get an idea of what's happening. "
"4382350","4384690"," So you can read so you guys can be on your own if I'm not here."
"4385090","4388490"," You can interpret this appropriately each day."
"4390310","4393910"," So let's take a look at the spy real quick. "
"4394090","4394190"," Okay."
"4396230","4397870"," And then we'll read the report once more."
"4399350","4401430"," And so you see the spy here, right?"
"4401750","4404590"," You see this right here 0.60% right?"
"4405410","4408310"," And spock gamma said the implied move today, right?"
"4408470","4409150"," The implied move. "
"4409650","4415630"," Now we can we can train outside of the implied move but where we implied is going to happen today,"
"4415630","4415850"," right?"
"4416070","4417650"," We're implying something's going to happen today."
"4417990","4424970"," We're applying we're going to move like 1.5%, 1.25%. And right now what the implied move is 6"
"4424970","4429010"," or 0.6%. So we're at 0.59% right now, right?"
"4429930","4432550"," We've traded to our upper bound up here, right?"
"4432950","4434470"," Right around 445, right?"
"4434710","4436530"," We know this is first resistance here, right?"
"4437190","4439530"," Right up in here is the first this is your resistance above."
"4441450","4444730"," And there in your support down below is 440, right?"
"4445630","4449710"," They also say in the Spock Emory report that next week, right?"
"4449930","4454070"," The bottom will be 430, not 440, but not today. "
"4454410","4454930"," Does that make sense?"
"4456130","4456530"," Okay."
"4456870","4465310"," Now, if this is a low ish for for a negative gamma environment, if we have low volatility today,"
"4465310","4469250"," the expectation is that we're going to trade in this range for most of today."
"4469650","4471010"," And we have so far. "
"4471150","4475390"," So from 930 until 12 o'clock in the afternoon, it's been two and a half hours."
"4475950","4478770"," We have maintained this trading range."
"4478770","4480710"," That is the expectation for today. "
"4481550","4485570"," We'll go through the report right now once more in what the expectation is."
"4485670","4488510"," Now with us trading it within this range, right?"
"4488710","4491710"," And if we're checking in book map, right?"
"4492070","4496270"," We're not seeing a lot of a lot of selling in the market, right?"
"4496370","4497610"," You're not seeing massive selling."
"4497790","4499610"," You're not seeing massive buying in the market. "
"4500330","4505310"," We know that put holders are going to monetize their puts today."
"4505750","4507690"," We know that they monetize them yesterday as well."
"4508770","4513590"," And we talked yesterday about Vanna rallies and the components of a Vanna rally, right?"
"4513910","4520810"," You get some help from de risking from dealers and market makers, right?"
"4521050","4530670"," And then the second the second part of that trade is going to be call buying, not call buying"
"4530670","4532330"," that's zero dates. "
"4533130","4538510"," It's call buying that's a week out, a month out, much higher strikes, right?"
"4538710","4540010"," Not in the money strikes for today."
"4540910","4545070"," You're looking for you today to be looking for a bunch of calls or yesterday, a bunch of calls at"
"4545070","4550410"," like 460, 470, expiring anywhere from a week to a month out, right?"
"4551050","4554590"," We haven't seen that yet today, at least in the indexes we haven't, right?"
"4555570","4557950"," And so we're kind of just fucking around here."
"4558310","4560830"," We haven't seen a ton of put buying here, right?"
"4560850","4562270"," So we're not going down yet. "
"4562970","4564190"," So we're just kind of hanging around."
"4564690","4567970"," Now, with that said, right?"
"4568390","4573190"," What happens as we move into the close in the spy, we're going to look at the actual report here"
"4573190","4573630"," in just a minute."
"4573630","4575730"," So what's the what's my thought process there?"
"4575810","4581130"," I don't think we sell down from here, even if we did sell down from here, how deep do we"
"4581130","4582190"," sell down, right?"
"4583350","4586330"," And if anything, this is kind of a place, you can see it right here, right?"
"4586490","4591570"," One bounce here, one bounce here, maybe we can get down to this 436, 438 down here. "
"4592170","4593350"," Too risky for my blood."
"4593790","4595190"," I've made my money this morning."
"4595690","4599290"," Actually, I broke even on these calls close to it, right?"
"4599450","4600470"," And I made a ton of money on Twitter. "
"4600630","4601570"," So am I taking that trade?"
"4602310","4609010"," That risk of us trading down right now in the middle of the afternoon, 12 o'clock in the still"
"4609010","4613390"," wait to see if we can trade higher up here to put some puts on."
"4613650","4619370"," I'm going to monitor the calls and put flow as they come in today in case we do start to"
"4619370","4621050"," aggressively sell off into the close."
"4621730","4626590"," My guess would be even if we do sell down, let's say we trade out of our implied range for"
"4626590","4627330"," today, right?"
"4627510","4632050"," The expectation for today is that those puts will still be monetized at some point. "
"4632630","4634410"," So let's say we trade down here, right?"
"4634870","4638070"," Let's say you're in some puts and you're like, oh, yeah, I'm getting my bear on at some fucking"
"4638070","4638370"," point."
"4638990","4642610"," There's always potential today because these puts are going to be closed."
"4643250","4645310"," We're going to our whipsaw right straight back up here. "
"4646250","4649490"," You can get caught in that whipsaw the moment those puts are closed."
"4650370","4652830"," So it's too much risk for my blood."
"4653210","4657070"," My whole purpose here today is to look for a moment up here. "
"4657130","4660570"," We can get up here at some point to buy some more puts for next week."
"4660770","4661790"," So that's my plan for today."
"4662890","4665870"," Even if we trade down here, I'm not going to buy some puts for them. "
"4666230","4668890"," My fear is that they'll be closed for profit."
"4669090","4670570"," You can see when it happens down here, right?"
"4670950","4672370"," Come down here, we slap it up higher."
"4672530","4673730"," Come down, we slap it up higher. "
"4675070","4675550"," It's right."
"4676130","4677290"," Come down here, slap it up higher."
"4677870","4678690"," One, two, three. "
"4679230","4682370"," If we did trade down here, I don't want to get caught in that move higher."
"4683350","4687230"," So I'm going to wait for the if this move higher happens to hire happens today into the bell."
"4687690","4688650"," I'm going to wait for it. "
"4688890","4691130"," You guys don't you guys see this happen on Fridays, right?"
"4691730","4693710"," Not every Friday, but some Fridays will sell down aggressively."
"4694010","4696970"," And then you're like, Oh, yeah, I'm getting put my puts on for Monday."
"4697270","4702810"," And then all of a sudden towards the bell, we scream higher and you're positioned wrong. "
"4703030","4705290"," You're not in position for the next leg down."
"4705770","4711070"," So this is what I'm looking for at some point today."
"4711330","4714510"," What do I think happens though in the meantime, the rest of this afternoon?"
"4714850","4715830"," I think we trade in here. "
"4716030","4717270"," I think I think we trade in here."
"4717490","4722470"," I think if we trade below here for a moment, we'll come back into this trading range until the last"
"4722470","4723230"," part of the afternoon."
"4723650","4725290"," It's quiet day of trading, believe it or not. "
"4726070","4730010"," So we're going to look at the Spock M report once more just so you guys can read through it"
"4730010","4731450"," with me do a second time."
"4732530","4734170"," And what does it say?"
"4734270","4738750"," Okay, if you just held the quiet overnight session currently trading near 4440, right?"
"4738870","4742670"," We look for muted volatility today right there, muted volatility."
"4742990","4744030"," That's what we're looking for, right?"
"4744470","4744970"," That's the implication. "
"4745230","4746150"," But it doesn't always happen."
"4746670","4750250"," We get some headline news that comes out, something that we don't see out of field."
"4751110","4756430"," The implied move is only about 0.67%. The last couple of days you've had moves that are 1.25,"
"4756730","4760450"," 1.50. Resistance remains at 4450, right?"
"4760730","4761530"," And then 4475. "
"4761890","4762830"," Snap some lines in your charts."
"4763650","4767110"," Support shows at 4435 and 4420, right?"
"4767710","4770590"," This is where we're expected to trade today, the expectation."
"4772230","4775550"," So in the low end, we're down to 442, right?"
"4776330","4779310"," We're currently sitting at 4400 right now, right?"
"4779490","4782670"," So we're even below our implied trading range right now. "
"4783290","4784450"," So do I think we go lower?"
"4784570","4785130"," Probably not."
"4785750","4791190"," We still register 25% spy and accused gamma rolling off today."
"4791630","4793550"," So this is danger for you if you're a bear. "
"4794670","4799190"," We can always squeeze the moment that these are monetized and closed out ahead of a three day"
"4799190","4799470"," weekend."
"4799610","4804150"," This is probably predominantly negative put gamma that's going away in line with this as stated for"
"4804150","4804830"," the last several days."
"4804830","4809790"," We thought this put heavy expiration into the long weekend to provide fuel for a market lift,"
"4810290","4810410"," right?"
"4812150","4816550"," With yesterday's 1% shift higher, we think that fuel is largely burned up. "
"4817170","4824490"," So we had part of our rally yesterday and we didn't see call buying yesterday to continue the fuel"
"4824490","4826710"," doing that fire yesterday."
"4826710","4828450"," So we've kind of peed it out, right?"
"4828770","4833750"," We've talked about that two in the past during these rallies, these vanner rallies, these vanner"
"4833750","4836010"," and charm rallies that we're not right."
"4836230","4838050"," It's probably what we are on the market. "
"4838090","4839290"," We know that the market breath is down."
"4840010","4847410"," We know that if people are expecting the markets roll over, we know we've got the doom and gloom of"
"4847410","4849070"," FMC coming out in May."
"4851450","4852950"," So we're not seeing it, right?"
"4853050","4854110"," We're just not seeing it today. "
"4854990","4856330"," So the rally is over."
"4857270","4860270"," But we also don't have puts down below, right?"
"4860690","4866330"," At 4.30, 4.20. We've got puts that are expiring today for 4.30 and 4.20. And the"
"4866330","4868110"," market makers aren't going to want to print those, right?"
"4869390","4871270"," They've lost all their value, right?"
"4871550","4872470"," At some point they're going to get closed."
"4874350","4876190"," And so the market market is going to take their money and run. "
"4876670","4883070"," As shown below, it's the dominant gamma strike on the board, 4.45, 50, is now fair value."
"4883930","4885770"," So do we expect to go higher without call buying?"
"4886130","4887090"," No, right?"
"4887210","4888650"," A large amount of which expires today."
"4888970","4890010"," That's the other key to, right?"
"4890210","4892690"," 4.45 is now for fair value. "
"4893010","4894810"," A large amount of which expires today."
"4895250","4896490"," Then what do we see happen today?"
"4896890","4897670"," Right off the bell."
"4898350","4899350"," I think we even said this. "
"4899490","4901630"," I think we even said yesterday, I think that I said too."
"4902030","4904110"," They'll probably come up here and tag it and then sell off."
"4904250","4905730"," I think you even said that yesterday's stream. "
"4906230","4908330"," And sure enough, we tagged this above and you know what they did?"
"4908490","4910190"," They closed their calls, right?"
"4910430","4912270"," Now they're going to come down here and try to close their puts."
"4913150","4915210"," And we'll probably trade sideways right into the bell."
"4915490","4921850"," Unless we have heavy put hedge buying or heavy call buying that we haven't seen yet. "
"4922330","4923570"," It hasn't presented itself yet."
"4924650","4925510"," So put this back here."
"4925610","4926790"," So we're just trading sideways, right?"
"4927090","4927590"," That's what we're doing. "
"4929410","4931590"," Ultimately we're in a no man's land at current levels."
"4932250","4933830"," So this is a key for you Chase, right?"
"4934090","4934790"," We're in a no man's land."
"4935670","4939270"," Just said to you guys out there that I'm not taking a trade currently on the spot. "
"4939510","4942730"," I said to you that you could take day trades on the spy right now."
"4942870","4946650"," You can buy some dips and reps as a trade sideways."
"4947250","4949110"," This expiration removes a fair amount of the put support. "
"4949750","4956650"," There is now no significant OPEC now until 520 and positioning is very neutral as per being at the"
"4956650","4959410"," gamma flip line of all trigger at 4435."
"4959590","4961730"," This makes the signing an edge difficult, right?"
"4961910","4962310"," Right here."
"4962510","4963790"," Key words right here, right?"
"4964150","4965810"," The signing edge is difficult here. "
"4966910","4969970"," What's expiring does open the market to lower lows."
"4970510","4972330"," This is what Winky talks about."
"4972450","4978670"," Winky's always out there saying if you know, and this is a weird thing to talk about. "
"4978770","4983750"," Not weird, but Chile's National Copper Company called Chilco, saying they see some growth in copper"
"4983750","4984690"," output this year."
"4985990","4995110"," When you guys hear about bags right being a bag holder out there, Winky's point is if 100 people"
"4995110","5000750"," buy 430 puts, right?"
"5001230","5007470"," Let's say if they buy 430 puts, they're not going to get a fill around those puts."
"5007850","5014170"," If another 100 people don't come in and say, oh yeah, I'll buy some 430 puts. "
"5014370","5017390"," As a matter of fact, let's have the first guy about those puts."
"5017750","5018990"," I'm going to try to convince you."
"5019270","5021890"," This is, I'm simplifying this, but I'm going to try to convince you. "
"5021990","5024890"," I'm going to say, hey, look, there's, we're still going to 430."
"5025470","5028710"," Oh, and by the way, we can probably go to 420, right?"
"5028930","5033610"," And so now you're out there buying my 430s and you're buying 420s probably."
"5034870","5040370"," If more buyers don't come in for those 430s or 420s, even deeper, right?"
"5040830","5045130"," 420s, 410s, we won't trade down to 430s for the original buyer of those puts. "
"5045350","5046230"," That's me, right?"
"5046630","5051170"," I'm not going to get paid unless there's someone else stepping in and putting their money down, I'm"
"5051170","5051830"," not going to get paid."
"5053090","5054410"," And so, Winky talks about that."
"5054510","5058450"," Winky's like a first hundred people come in and say, I'm buying 430s and we don't get more follow"
"5058450","5058870"," through. "
"5061030","5065470"," Marketmakers aren't going to pull out a hundred bucks out of their pocket and pay me, right?"
"5065790","5068770"," They want to take it out of another fair's pocket and pay me."
"5069910","5072930"," And they skim some money up the top and then you got theta gang in there and all that kind"
"5072930","5075290"," of shit, skimming as well along the way."
"5076350","5079410"," Sometimes they get caught with their pants down and they do have to pay out of their pocket. "
"5079570","5082030"," But they thought they're not in business to do that."
"5082530","5088290"," They're in business for me as the original put buyer to convince you as the new put buyer to enter"
"5088290","5089890"," the market, right?"
"5090150","5096290"," So that you buy my bags so that the marketmakers and dealers aren't buying my bags, right?"
"5096690","5101470"," And the marketmakers and dealers would do everything that they possibly can to ensure that you"
"5101470","5104210"," don't get a print if you're the only bag holder there."
"5104370","5108750"," So if I'm the original bag holder and I don't see more puts come in today in the market, heavy"
"5108750","5115410"," put buying, heavy bearish attitude today, you're not going to see those lower bounds in the market. "
"5115670","5117050"," So we're looking for that right now."
"5117150","5117870"," We're not seeing it."
"5118510","5119710"," So that's their point, right?"
"5120130","5125570"," And Winky's other point is even if the market's heading there, we know that we're going to 430,"
"5125670","5126110"," right?"
"5126610","5133410"," That Winky's point is basically once all that interest on those 430 puts is wiped from the board,"
"5133930","5134890"," they'll then tag 430. "
"5135810","5140790"," They'll tag it, they don't pay anybody, and then we'll move higher from there, okay?"
"5141070","5143070"," So you know, thank you for playing."
"5143590","5145250"," I'm taking all your money away from you."
"5145670","5148170"," And now we're going to get out and slam for 430. "
"5148430","5152270"," So key point in this is you want to be ahead of the game right now."
"5153210","5158590"," And you're going to be looking for a positioning day today, you're going to position yourself for"
"5158590","5158710"," him."
"5159050","5161690"," And this is some other facts we'll read up or read that stuff here, right?"
"5162170","5167750"," As you can see, the gamma reduces with today's expiration and note the cake around about 4400 that"
"5167750","5168090"," goes away. "
"5168250","5172350"," This is due to puts being removed, which leads to reduce negative game position through another"
"5172350","5172590"," lens."
"5172590","5176070"," You can see this as pure positions in a market that has less hedges."
"5176230","5181290"," If new puts are added, that voice is negative delta hedging up the dealer's AKA short futures and"
"5181290","5181810"," downside pressure. "
"5182050","5186910"," A new hour here in New York, the Dow down up 30, the S&P is down 26 and an"
"5186910","5188370"," outside composite down 187."
"5189050","5191850"," Crew futures again, lifting towards the upper end of their quarter."
"5192470","5197830"," The range today on this latest New York Times report on nearing a phased in ban of Russian oil"
"5197830","5202330"," yields are higher globally after the ECB earlier today. "
"5202750","5208350"," The US two year yield is up significantly to 2.435%. The 10 year is up 10 basis points at"
"5208350","5213530"," 280 once again, while in Germany, the 10 year boom is up 784 basis points."
"5214470","5217310"," I'm going to check HYG and the J&K."
"5224860","5226680"," Yeah, a little risk off in J&K. "
"5227000","5229980"," A little bit of selling J&K."
"5231020","5233340"," A little bit of rolling, HYG as well."
"5235720","5236120"," It's good to see. "
"5237300","5238600"," Showing the market rolling over."
"5238780","5239940"," Nice sell off in TLT."
"5239940","5245180"," It's going to be good into the weekend. "
"5248020","5252960"," If new puts are added, that voice is negative delta hedging onto dealers, short futures."
"5253300","5254840"," It's likely puts to be added at lower strikes."
"5255840","5257860"," It's likely puts to be added at lower strikes. "
"5258400","5264600"," We'd have a new lower bound now at a lower strike, something like 4300 next week."
"5265940","5268260"," We had bottom this week of 4400."
"5268580","5274480"," I can further this report on oils and their sources indicating that this phased in band will not be"
"5274480","5277500"," put up for talks until after the French elections. "
"5280020","5281960"," Getting a bid right now in USO as well."
"5283800","5285680"," I'm checking BNO right now."
"5286720","5288420"," Bit in BNO as well. "
"5297370","5301670"," I must note that the SP is technically above the vol trigger of 4435 per our model."
"5301790","5303390"," This compels us to give an edge to the bullish side."
"5303910","5305350"," We tagged our bullish side, right?"
"5305490","5307170"," We tagged right up the bell, 4450. "
"5308610","5309670"," What do we tag today?"
"5309790","5314230"," We tagged almost to the pin, 4450, almost to the pin."
"5315050","5316790"," So we tagged our 4450, right?"
"5316950","5318670"," That was our bullish edge that we got today."
"5319550","5321390"," I closed my calls this morning. "
"5321470","5322030"," We tagged it."
"5323010","5326790"," We likely want to recapture 4500 to signal true risk on position."
"5327510","5330090"," We already know what the market breadth indicator we're rolling over the market. "
"5330090","5332130"," We're looking for lower lows next week."
"5333010","5340710"," So the point being is expect today to trade with an arrange for the rest of today and find a"
"5340710","5342770"," place to buy some puts."
"5343650","5345190"," And I haven't bought mine yet. "
"5345370","5346970"," I should have bought mine yesterday and I didn't."
"5347250","5349110"," I should have added mine on there."
"5349450","5352370"," I see calls coming in the market right now on the spine and the cues. "
"5354770","5358070"," The chat was saying, well, we should sell off here, right?"
"5358250","5359030"," We should sell off."
"5359630","5362370"," Let me get rid of this."
"5365090","5369970"," Someone just said a few minutes ago that we should buy, I don't know who said it, but someone said"
"5369970","5371010"," we should buy puts here, right?"
"5372190","5376330"," And what did I tell you at when I got on 10 o'clock or 10 30 or so I"
"5376330","5381150"," told you, I said we're more than likely going to trade in this range here, right?"
"5382050","5385730"," And I said you can buy the dips and sell the rips. "
"5385990","5393330"," I also said that inside of this range here, if we trade out of that bound, right, if we trade"
"5393330","5395510"," down below, it's a good place to buy a dip."
"5395710","5398870"," If we trade up and above it, it's a good place to sell the rip, right?"
"5399870","5402730"," Otherwise, we're kind of stuck in this range in here."
"5404090","5408170"," And you can see right here, if you just bought some, if you'd bought some put or some puts here,"
"5408170","5409270"," you'd be fucked right now, right?"
"5410290","5412330"," And just kind of smooth right back up, right?"
"5412510","5413250"," Just trapped you in. "
"5413630","5415850"," Don't get caught, try not to get caught."
"5416510","5417930"," Then you can see this right here."
"5417990","5419190"," I talked about this earlier, right?"
"5419430","5419890"," Let me show you this. "
"5420670","5422510"," I said you're going to get caught with day traders."
"5422930","5427390"," They're going to do simple setups in the market in the middle of the day."
"5427490","5428990"," And this is playing itself out, right?"
"5429090","5433550"," I said to you, look for simple setups, bull flags and bear flags. "
"5433790","5434530"," I said that to you, right?"
"5434690","5436450"," And here's one right here, right?"
"5436510","5438330"," This is all day trader bullshit, right?"
"5438910","5441530"," You get this nice little bear flag right here, breaks below."
"5442290","5448530"," And it starts to, it starts to, it's starting to consolidate once again, right?"
"5449590","5451870"," So just do these little day trades in here."
"5452210","5453130"," This is all fuckery. "
"5453270","5455370"," This is all just day traders dicking around."
"5455690","5459350"," This is kind of like, you know, a bunch of old guys in a room and they know all the"
"5459350","5460670"," tricks and that's all they're doing."
"5460670","5463910"," They're going to dick around all day long today into the close. "
"5464350","5469550"," And as we get into the close, you're going to see either selling off or some squeezing higher."
"5469810","5470830"," I don't know which way we go yet."
"5472110","5476530"," My thought process is they're just going to take sit back a little bit, take it easy. "
"5477170","5479350"," And I'm just going to wait until we get near this close."
"5480130","5484550"," And I'm going to hope I'm hoping that we trade higher at some point today, whether it's right now"
"5484550","5489450"," or if it's into the three o'clock hour, I'm going to be looking to grab some put spreads for"
"5489450","5489830"," next week."
"5490830","5495590"," Probably going to get them for, we'll take a look at some spreads today, what they cost and what"
"5495590","5496630"," the expectation is. "
"5497350","5499370"," We can do some different dates and stuff."
"5499570","5501250"," We'll blast through some of this stuff."
"5502050","5507290"," And I'll do it live with you guys to show you some decent spreads for next week. "
"5507470","5509850"," We'll look at 430, we'll look for 440s to 430."
"5511010","5512650"," We'll look at different expiration dates."
"5513610","5514910"," We'll look at an expiration for Friday. "
"5515710","5518030"," We'll look at an expiration for Monday."
"5518470","5519870"," It's not this Monday, but next Monday."
"5520830","5523330"," And then we'll look for an expiration in May. "
"5523630","5525130"," And we'll look for an expiration in June."
"5526650","5529750"," I think we'll look for an expiration in late May, if there's any available."
"5530010","5531230"," I don't know if they're available right now. "
"5531650","5535230"," I haven't looked, but we'll look for things out here."
"5540710","5547710"," We'll look for an expiration on May 18th."
"5548370","5550830"," We'll look for an expiration on May 20th. "
"5551490","5552690"," And then we'll do what Winky wants."
"5552910","5553850"," What Winky always recommends."
"5554150","5556070"," I agree with Winky most of the time on this stuff. "
"5556690","5560150"," Even if it doesn't go our way, we'll look at May 27th as well."
"5561370","5564570"," For some in the money, put spreads and see if they can print 100-200%."
"5564570","5567330"," We'll throw some of those on at some point today before the end of the day. "
"5569110","5570790"," And we'll go and have a great weekend."
"5570990","5571770"," You don't have to worry about them."
"5572490","5575550"," Even when we are right now, we can trade up to 450, 460. "
"5576070","5579710"," And I'd still be comfortable knowing that more than likely we're going to print those put spreads"
"5579710","5580270"," at some point."
"5580770","5585350"," Lots of calls coming right now on Oxie April 22nd, 62C."
"5585530","5590290"," President Biden just acknowledging that they are making a decision now on whether or not they'll be"
"5590290","5592110"," sending a high-level official to the Ukraine. "
"5593270","5597570"," We did see some reports of that earlier in the session and recently that they would be sending some"
"5597570","5600770"," high-level personnel to the Ukraine here at some point."
"5602730","5604510"," An interesting trade just came in."
"5604950","5608730"," TLT, June 17th, 130C. "
"5608990","5610630"," I wanted to talk about this yesterday too."
"5610890","5617230"," I think I talked about it briefly the other day, but you should be considering longing bonds at"
"5617230","5617690"," this point."
"5617910","5624210"," I don't know if I posted that on Twitter last night, but you should start to consider a trade in"
"5624210","5624930"," TLT. "
"5625170","5634890"," The ratio for, I believe it's TLT, as a TLT and HYG, that ratio right now is at a place"
"5634890","5644070"," where it's at resistance on a downward channel, and which implies that we are at a bottom for TLT,"
"5644970","5646970"," a localized bottom for TLT."
"5647470","5650130"," We should see a bounce and not a relief bounce."
"5650290","5654830"," I heard someone say we're due for relief bounce on TLT, and I disagree. "
"5656470","5657730"," It's not a relief bounce."
"5658330","5664410"," You're going to see a reversal in TLT, and I posted some of that stuff earlier this week, but even"
"5664410","5668530"," though we sold off yesterday in TLT, I said that we talked about yesterday putting on some call"
"5668530","5677770"," spreads for June, and someone just bought $577,000 in June 17th, 130C."
"5678630","5682470"," We're currently at 121, so we'll take a look at that spread as well for June. "
"5683290","5691550"," I think if you want a safer trade, and you're a bull, to consider the TLT trade as we move"
"5691550","5692330"," into summertime."
"5693090","5695410"," I'm also watching more oxycalls roll through the door."
"5695410","5702690"," It looks like the old trade is being kept alive April 14th, 60C, $13,000, but the TLT trade, I"
"5702690","5703570"," think, is finally here. "
"5704350","5710850"," I think even if we traded down to that 110, I think I think we tagged I think the other"
"5710850","5717050"," day I posted 120, and then what did I post down here the other day?"
"5717170","5718550"," Let me look at this."
"5721690","5723030"," Yeah, I read that lower bound."
"5723570","5726910"," Let me show you what I tried it out the other day. "
"5728150","5729510"," I was about to dip down here."
"5730530","5732790"," By anything down here I talked about."
"5733470","5736910"," If we can get down to one 16 was the lower bound. "
"5737910","5742510"," I don't know why it's not here, but going back in time, this seems like the place."
"5742790","5746710"," I also on Twitter talked about how you have a capitulation moment, and we're having those"
"5746710","5748050"," capitulation moments right now."
"5748170","5748750"," You can see them. "
"5749770","5751890"," You can actually see it in the volume as well."
"5752630","5753550"," The capitulation move."
"5753710","5760110"," If we can get down to like 120, 116, somewhere in here, I think that you're going to see it's"
"5760110","5760810"," a trade that you put on. "
"5760810","5762190"," You don't look at for the next couple months."
"5762630","5764190"," I think you're going to see a beautiful run."
"5765010","5766790"," This would be more like out here. "
"5766930","5769190"," You're going to see a beautiful run back up here."
"5769270","5769630"," There's 130."
"5769810","5770810"," I think that's a great trade. "
"5771210","5774170"," June 17th, 130 C's."
"5774690","5777210"," I think it accounts for continued selling and weakness."
"5777890","5779190"," I think it'll still print for us. "
"5779290","5779890"," Just keep this one."
"5780250","5783770"," Keep this trade front and center."
"5783910","5785710"," If you're worried about going along something. "
"5786450","5791690"," I know that I've heard a lot of people saying that TLT should continue to sell off."
"5792350","5793630"," That's not true."
"5795350","5797150"," That is technically not true. "
"5799210","5800390"," We are at support."
"5801510","5803690"," Anywhere from here to like 116 RAT support."
"5806930","5807910"," Let's see here for a minute. "
"5810610","5811530"," Just a second here."
"5815770","5816730"," Check out the hair indicator."
"5818830","5820770"," Just neutral on the hair indicator this morning. "
"5823090","5824290"," Do you still have that spike everything?"
"5824790","5825370"," No, we're just gone."
"5826830","5827470"," I think that's it."
"5828930","5830170"," Keep your eyes on TLT. "
"5830310","5831070"," Keep your eyes on Oxy."
"5831430","5836610"," Keep your eyes on BNO and USO for that Russia news."
"5837430","5843630"," They're going to ban oil imports from Russia to France, I believe. "
"5844970","5847710"," And oil is getting a bid right now."
"5848030","5850090"," USO is still being bid in right now."
"5850810","5852530"," Matter of fact, they spiked after that report. "
"5853210","5858730"," So there's that spike that came in on USO on that news that they're going to ban, Russian oil."
"5860170","5861890"," So that this is USO, not BNO."
"5862310","5864610"," BNO probably is experiencing the same thing right now. "
"5865410","5867170"," As we talked about BNO just a few moments ago."
"5867510","5871850"," Nice little rip face ripper right here after that news from Trade the News on oil."
"5872650","5874730"," So BNO was a good trade. "
"5875670","5880010"," USO in other good trade and started to consider TLT."
"5880290","5881410"," And we'll start at some point."
"5881850","5882770"," I'm going to take a quick break. "
"5883170","5884110"," And what I'm going to do is come back."
"5884710","5887170"," It's 12 o'clock in the grab a quick bite to eat."
"5887870","5890430"," And what we're going to do is we're going to look at the second half of the afternoon. "
"5890430","5894270"," We're going to look at some put spreads for next week."
"5894870","5900630"," Now that we can place those trades and see if we can catch some prints into next, some prints into"
"5900630","5901130"," next week."
"5903710","5908370"," Did anybody buy put spreads yesterday about 445?"
"5909410","5910570"," By the way, I'm wondering. "
"5911970","5913210"," I know we talked about them yesterday."
"5913930","5915310"," They should already be printing right now, right?"
"5916870","5918010"," For where we are on the market."
"5937910","5938890"," Well, that would be dope. "
"5940510","5944550"," If I can't wait for Elon to sell his Twitter shares, hopefully he does it all at once."
"5945010","5945670"," That'd be hilarious."
"5952690","5955610"," Halloween shareholder told Elon to fuck off on his Twitter purchase. "
"5955810","5956230"," That's hilarious."
"5967120","5968520"," You don't like the ads on Reddit?"
"5969140","5969440"," Yeah."
"5972480","5978540"," It's about, yeah, I'm only talks about open to close price, not intraday. "
"5982600","5986100"," Oh, see, it's time for some content readers there by foreign government spam."
"5987380","5988820"," All right, let's see what you guys are talking about over there."
"5992920","5995080"," Yeah, I like the, the XLU trades been awesome. "
"6020990","6021990"," Let me just take it here."
"6036100","6041960"," That just slow drift and, look at this, just slow drift and Twitter."
"6042580","6046120"," The moment they figured out they weren't having that meat and it was just like, fuck this. "
"6047180","6050480"," Just fucking, you're just gonna, this is terrible to watch right here."
"6053100","6056140"," I'm so glad I fucking sold, I said I bought right down in here."
"6056700","6060780"," I fucking bought this tip down in here and they went to like 52 cents or something. "
"6060900","6062900"," There was like two bumps and I was like, I'm out."
"6063180","6064260"," I'm taking money and running."
"6064760","6066460"," I think this was right at 10 a.m. too. "
"6067460","6071900"," We'd squeeze, we'd squeeze, we'd squeeze higher and it actually, I said I was gonna buy some puts"
"6071900","6073680"," up here and I didn't."
"6074300","6075700"," I was trying to get the stream set up."
"6076120","6079720"," I didn't have time to buy puts up here because I wanted to trade both sides of that trade. "
"6080400","6082500"," I wish I had bought puts up here and I didn't plan."
"6082500","6087540"," I didn't know anything about the, about the meeting being moved to after hours."
"6087660","6087920"," That sucks. "
"6088240","6090360"," A few buck calls and help in here."
"6090620","6091460"," That fucking sucks."
"6092120","6094120"," Especially that news saying they're not gonna have a decision. "
"6096840","6098640"," They're not gonna have a fucking decision."
"6098900","6099220"," It's hilarious."
"6103890","6106870"," You got some zero date put spreads at the high there but it fumbled them. "
"6111140","6120660"," Yeah, the reason I was, my thought process was, I"
"6120660","6125060"," like between 9 30 or so, I was like, well, I figured this would happen here."
"6125160","6127440"," I'm like, I know everybody's gonna buy calls right at the fucking bell."
"6128040","6132040"," I was like, right in here, I'm like, I know they're gonna buy calls right off the gate and every"
"6132040","6133220"," fucking time we drop. "
"6134620","6139600"," So we dropped down here and we started to settle around here and I was like, man, we come into"
"6139600","6139760"," this."
"6139900","6141560"," I'm like, we're gonna squeeze in a 10 o'clock."
"6142060","6145420"," If this, if this meetings take, there's some people are posting the meeting with a tenant. "
"6145420","6148760"," I'm like, I'm like, there are no fucking way anyone's gonna risk being short here."
"6149000","6149920"," It's just not worth it."
"6150000","6150780"," It's just not worth it. "
"6151400","6158560"," So I figured, well, we'd squeeze up into that meeting starting and we squeezed up into here and I"
"6158560","6161760"," went, they went from like 30, I think I thought up for 32 cents and I sold them for 52"
"6161760","6162200"," cents."
"6162780","6165980"," And I was like, I said, we kind of just fucked around in here and I'm like, I'm out."
"6166260","6167180"," Fucked this amount of here. "
"6167460","6169500"," I took the money and I started getting the stream ready."
"6169500","6171020"," I'm like, Oh, we'll day trade this."
"6171200","6174460"," I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I bet when I come back, it's fucking just grinding up. "
"6174920","6178420"," And I come back, I get out and I'm like, why are we going down over here?"
"6178900","6182640"," I'm talking to you guys about Twitter and I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, why does it just keep"
"6182640","6183560"," fucking trailing off?"
"6183980","6187760"," So I'm like, I got on Twitter here and I'm like, Oh shit, that fucking meeting is that fucking two"
"6187760","6188700"," plus removed the two."
"6189020","6190160"," And dude, people are posting it."
"6190480","6193460"," They weren't posting Eastern Standard Time or Pacific Time. "
"6193820","6195200"," And of course, I finally found it."
"6195320","6197020"," I'm like, what the fuck is going on?"
"6197820","6204080"," So dude, if you buy calls in here, unless something gets leaked, you're fucked."
"6205320","6208780"," This is going to grind out all the positions today. "
"6210040","6211420"," Getting it fucked in here today."
"6214560","6215640"," It's going to get ugly."
"6227010","6229450"," Let's take a look at if it's bullish here. "
"6230150","6233250"," Yeah, 440 49."
"6233430","6233810"," Let's take a look."
"6235030","6236330"," Hair indicator is slightly down. "
"6237610","6240170"," All right, that's 85850 on the hair indicator."
"6241490","6243270"," Let's take a look and see what school looking down."
"6243490","6248470"," See if the spy is has some support looks like I got some support relevant support. "
"6249090","6252350"," Maybe it could trade down to 43950 somewhere down in here."
"6255170","6256470"," You can see it up in here."
"6256630","6257890"," There's still some buyers down here. "
"6259110","6260190"," 438 has some buyers."
"6263260","6265940"," Probably the deepest we go is 438 if you wanted to grab some puts."
"6267100","6268620"," I don't think we get that at 435. "
"6270540","6272460"," I am watching some puts come in though right now."
"6272600","6273540"," Oh, heads up too."
"6276320","6277680"," So I will tag this. "
"6277900","6279300"," I got a tuckball that's coming in right now."
"6281180","6281920"," Let's see here."
"6283220","6285360"," I'm watching some puts coming in right now too. "
"6286480","6286980"," Let's look here."
"6287160","6288680"," Let's see if we can find a nice bounce."
"6290940","6295220"," Maybe a price target of 438 before a buyer step in. "
"6295680","6296080"," 438."
"6296940","6297380"," You can see that."
"6299440","6301280"," Watching oil go up right now. "
"6301500","6304300"," Watching rates go up right now."
"6304760","6305420"," Also interesting."
"6305940","6309320"," So I'm watching some spy puts come in April 14th, 440p. "
"6310060","6314220"," At some point, people are going to start buying puts for our farther data out."
"6314420","6314920"," So you're seeing them."
"6316000","6316720"," 414, right?"
"6317520","6318160"," These are for today. "
"6321800","6323920"," 414, 440p, $90,000."
"6324860","6329440"," QQQs, 418, 338p, $7,800,000."
"6329880","6333160"," When you start, we talked about it, if you start to see more puts in the market, we can't trade"
"6333160","6334680"," lower than our expected range. "
"6335120","6336480"," So we are starting to see that stuff come in."
"6336740","6339580"," But it really neat right now is the TLT trade."
"6341660","6345120"," Now watching a second trade on TLT. "
"6345760","6350060"," June 17th, golden ticket, 120c for a million dollars."
"6350620","6354720"," I'm going to look and see how many how many trades are coming for TLT at this point."
"6355020","6357380"," We haven't seen much action in TLT lately. "
"6358000","6363300"," So you see $1.6 million on TLT."
"6363960","6368040"," If you guys are in discord, take a look real quick at the options so you can follow along with"
"6368040","6368160"," me."
"6368560","6372780"," So TLT, June 17th, 120 and 130c's. "
"6373180","6375620"," We haven't seen a lot of action on TLT with big money."
"6377240","6379480"," So that's that $1.5, $1.6 million."
"6380440","6382060"," Some other neat ones in here. "
"6382680","6384280"," You guys want to watch this stuff for sure."
"6386340","6394140"," SPX, we've got a $90 million call, 4,4,2,5."
"6394920","6400560"," That's for September 16th, 4,4,2,5 for $90 million. "
"6401480","6402060"," Just got bought."
"6402800","6408080"," As a matter of fact, it wouldn't shock me to see if that's Jamie Diamond and JPM that would not"
"6408080","6408740"," surprise me."
"6408820","6410600"," We wouldn't shock me if that was JPM doing that. "
"6411100","6413720"," We also have $10 million on zoom calls."
"6414760","6423000"," That's for June 17th, 105c for $8.3 million and July 15th for 100c."
"6423140","6426080"," That's probably winky doing that for $1.9 million. "
"6428000","6436540"," So a big bid in SPX, a big big bid in zoom, $4.6 million on Nike spread around September"
"6436540","6443340"," 16th for 135c and then April 29th for 127c."
"6444060","6445140"," That's a pretty big bid, right?"
"6445380","6450480"," $90 million in SPX, $10 million on zoom, $5 million on Nike."
"6452240","6454520"," And we have $2 million on KO. "
"6455240","6460500"," Futures of extended gains are now in positive territory above 104.50 in the wake of that latest"
"6460500","6465840"," report on the EU gradually moving towards a phased and banned of Russian oil."
"6467880","6477820"," KO has a bid for $1.9 million, strikes for one January 20th, 2023 65c $1.5"
"6477820","6478060"," million."
"6479680","6482280"," Tesla has some call buying coming into it. "
"6482620","6485040"," It's been slowly building throughout the day."
"6485540","6488060"," It's probably betting against the deal going through."
"6488380","6494040"," TLT never sees calls, hasn't seen calls and sometimes there's a bid there for a couple million"
"6494040","6495460"," dollars, $1.6 million. "
"6495900","6499160"," SE, a favorite, I know some of you guys pay this SE all the time."
"6499920","6501980"," This is for SE for C."
"6504280","6507880"," January 20th, 130c for $1.5 million."
"6509940","6512260"," Let me see if there's anything else interesting in here. "
"6513040","6520840"," Dish, Dish has calls May 20th, 32.5c for $1.1 million."
"6522260","6523840"," This is another big one here."
"6524160","6526900"," STLD, that's Sierra Tango Lima Delta. "
"6528340","6534220"," January 19th, 2024, 100c for $1 million."
"6535960","6537820"," What else is interesting in here?"
"6539420","6547040"," V-E-R-U, lots of calls, strikes, 15c, dated for today."
"6548020","6549300"," I haven't checked that one at all today. "
"6549320","6550940"," I wasn't paying attention to V-E-E-R-U."
"6551600","6552640"," I haven't looked at it at all."
"6553300","6554660"," It looks like day traders are in there. "
"6555580","6557280"," That's another good one right there."
"6557500","6561500"," Twitter, of course, Twitter call buying $400,000 this morning."
"6563880","6565500"," Trade was this one, let me look that well. "
"6565820","6568540"," B-B-I-G got some call orders coming on it."
"6569480","6570560"," And let's look at the put side."
"6572580","6579520"," M-M-M, $1.2 million in puts, June 17th, 150p for $1.2 million. "
"6580380","6584640"," Upstart, May 20th, 85p, $1.2 million."
"6585940","6591780"," V-T-I, $1,000,000 bets, June 17th, 225p."
"6593460","6595680"," Twitter, $1,000,000 against Twitter. "
"6597040","6598400"," A bunch of puts."
"6599320","6603220"," Damn, someone puts on BP this morning for this afternoon."
"6604000","6609380"," October 21st, 30 and 29p for $700,000. "
"6610680","6612960"," Mar, I think that's Marriott, not sure."
"6614020","6620560"," January 20th, 2023, 160p for $700,000."
"6620800","6622420"," Wix has some puts on it. "
"6624240","6627600"," June 17th, 90p for $570,000."
"6628100","6630680"," It makes bag with Tesla Nvidia, small money."
"6632860","6636720"," Etsy, JKS, Apple. "
"6637520","6638300"," We'll see the others."
"6641420","6642500"," We'll go back over here."
"6644780","6646860"," USO, B-N-O, cranking. "
"6651700","6653680"," Just blasting off on USO and B-N-O."
"6653800","6656640"," We'll take a look at USO and B-N-O and see if this is a top."
"6666240","6671740"," Look at B-N-O as well. "
"6678770","6680430"," Still more buyers of oil."
"6681430","6682650"," Found support again."
"6691320","6701590"," Support at 78.20. Currently trading at 78.51. Take"
"6701590","6702110"," a keep going. "
"6704350","6706390"," There's some volatility here above."
"6710750","6716210"," Price target, $79.90, $80."
"6716910","6721570"," We're already at 78.57. Price target on USO, $80. "
"6727840","6729380"," We'll look at B-N-O next."
"6748070","6749050"," Let me get this up here."
"6751650","6754770"," More sellers on B-N-O than the USO. "
"6757110","6761400"," A second here, closer here."
"6762420","6763780"," A lot of volatility."
"6764280","6765540"," This might have been being shorted. "
"6767360","6771620"," I like the USO trade better than I like the B-N-O trade."
"6772460","6772880"," Up right there."
"6773700","6782960"," Price target on B-N-O is $32.50. You could possibly squeeze at the $34 and"
"6782960","6790800"," right there, $32.50. I like the trade better on USO than I do on B-N-O. "
"6791900","6795340"," My assumption is that there was some shorts that got squeezed in B-N-O."
"6800650","6803250"," Still just kind of puttering along here in the spy, right?"
"6808990","6818890"," Just testing lower bounds now at $440.21. Take a look down here and see if there's"
"6818890","6819670"," anything down here."
"6821170","6821990"," See against this. "
"6822350","6829010"," Be careful down here at $4.39.80. Looks like there's some buyers just hiding out."
"6829270","6830430"," You can see this red mark right here."
"6832230","6833790"," Some hidden buyers down below here. "
"6835630","6841290"," If there's a break or a rug pulled down on the spy, next stop is $4.38. I was a"
"6841290","6842990"," little bit of traffic in here, but not too bad."
"6843450","6845330"," But I don't like this down here for a breach."
"6846530","6848290"," You can see them even on the right hand side. "
"6848490","6850250"," The buyers are just waiting right here."
"6851210","6852750"," So you might get a squeeze at some point."
"6854110","6855570"," See that red mark right there?"
"6856410","6869340"," You can see it right there hiding out at $4.39.84. Keep"
"6869340","6870180"," an eye on this one right here. "
"6879770","6884170"," $4.39.87 or so somewhere in there."
"6893950","6895210"," Might be placing a trade here."
"6895330","6895490"," Hold on. "
"6916350","6918030"," We'll see if we get a reaction here or not."
"6920450","6930430"," You can see this red line right here and then down below here at"
"6930430","6936990"," $4.38. What you want to be looking for on the right hand side is if this big green wave"
"6936990","6941290"," here, if it shoots down and gets a slimmer right, if there's a rug pull, we'll see if we'll get"
"6941290","6943050"," the rug pull or not or a reaction."
"6954430","6956630"," Here are indicators turning negative right now. "
"6965160","6967540"," Wish I had bought, put spreads on the spy."
"6968580","6969680"," Wish I had had time this morning."
"6970420","6971840"," I'm kind of pissed off that I didn't. "
"6973760","6975160"," Can I get caught up in sometimes?"
"6976480","6981680"," This happens to me like, oh, we'll come into a bottom and I'll be like, oh, all day long, I'll"
"6981680","6984320"," be like, oh, yeah, I'm going to buy my call spreads for the month down here."
"6984940","6990820"," I get wrapped up buying zero dates and I forget to fucking buy my call spreads too."
"6991960","6996160"," Like, I'm not like to have a time to put the call spread on and then like the day passes"
"6996160","7000100"," and I remember, I'm like, shit, I didn't get my call spreads when I was down there. "
"7000200","7001440"," I was fucking around zero dates."
"7004670","7008230"," I feel like I did that yesterday to the close and I feel like I did that at the open"
"7008230","7008730"," this morning."
"7009450","7012810"," I got two perfect opportunities that I put spreads and I didn't buy them. "
"7015670","7017110"," I didn't take my own advice."
"7017790","7019950"," I was too busy giving other people advice."
"7022190","7026010"," So I'm just kind of fucking swinging my dick out here begging and hoping that we get back up to"
"7026510","7027750"," our 445 today. "
"7029590","7038390"," I got my trigger finger on some 441 C's too."
"7039630","7042270"," If this doesn't break, I'm going to look for a squeeze higher."
"7043310","7045150"," Kind of pissed off here. "
"7048110","7050370"," Let's take a look at the chart."
"7051190","7052430"," Just keep an eye on the chart right here."
"7053370","7053870"," Let's see where we are. "
"7055650","7058710"," Take another little flag that showed itself here, right?"
"7062170","7063210"," Fucking day traders."
"7069980","7071420"," Let's see what happens here."
"7072580","7074320"," Let's see what we get a counter trade going on. "
"7096100","7102740"," I'm seeing some call buying on the queues, April 20th 340 C, $455,000."
"7107090","7108570"," It's an interesting trade."
"7108970","7111450"," Someone bought Twitter calls as unusual. "
"7112210","7113310"," I wouldn't expect this."
"7113450","7115030"," So I'm looking for this kind of stuff here."
"7115230","7122670"," Someone bought Twitter calls May 6th, 50 C, high algo score. "
"7122890","7126370"," Not really high, but not to be expected."
"7126750","7128350"," It's shit like this that I'm looking for."
"7129690","7136430"," Why is somebody buying May 6th, 50 C's for $100,000?"
"7136950","7138870"," It's abnormal. "
"7139690","7142370"," If you were looking at Twitter today, you'd be like, nah, I'm not buying shit."
"7143490","7144670"," So we get closer to the bell."
"7149030","7150710"," So just give a heads up on that one. "
"7150950","7152290"," May 6th, 50 C."
"7154410","7158610"," I wouldn't expect anybody buying calls today on Twitter at this point with knowing that."
"7160550","7162450"," I'm going to go search that real quick."
"7163450","7173800"," I want"
"7173800","7176020"," to look to see if there's any new news on Twitter. "
"7176020","7177280"," We don't know about."
"7180280","7182320"," CFRA diverates Twitter after Musk offer."
"7182680","7183120"," Here's why. "
"7187580","7192340"," And then the website for this is billionaire club, something.com."
"7198200","7204480"," Twitter will hold it all hands meeting employees at 2PM Pacific time, discuss Musk offer."
"7205580","7206540"," That was one hour ago."
"7206700","7208180"," Let me reset this whole thing here. "
"7215140","7220080"," People are scheming that if they buy enough, calls that can pump the price of $100, forcing you on"
"7220080","7223960"," to buy them out at that price as long as they don't sell."
"7226180","7227620"," Twitter acting very strange."
"7231260","7232780"," Twitter squeeze coming to $100. "
"7233360","7234380"," I don't know about that."
"7235580","7237520"," Who are these crazy motherfuckers out there?"
"7237700","7246950"," Is there some going on with Twitter that I don't know."
"7247070","7248550"," It's squeezing a little bit right now. "
"7251450","7252550"," It's squeezing a little bit."
"7252630","7253690"," Somebody bought Twitter calls."
"7254410","7255950"," A lot of Twitter calls. "
"7258810","7260150"," There's a little bit of squeeze there."
"7260330","7261150"," Nothing major."
"7261350","7270880"," It went from like $45 to $46.11 to see what they're here. "
"7279080","7281180"," Twitter shareholder Saudi Prince, Halloween."
"7282280","7284000"," Did he tweet that himself?"
"7286760","7291620"," Twitter back to green up, 0.67%. This happens Twitter under alone with two."
"7293560","7298040"," If number four happens in Twitter under Elon with two Apple and Big Tech for anti-competitive"
"7298040","7301060"," monopoly actions, it would be an epic legal battle. "
"7301640","7304280"," If you guys fucking love the soap opera, that's fucking..."
"7304280","7305540"," I love the soap opera."
"7305780","7306100"," I do too."
"7306240","7307060"," I shouldn't say I don't. "
"7307380","7309620"," The fucking stock market is like a fucking soap opera."
"7317400","7321300"," Is the Saudi Prince's tweet unethical and undue influence?"
"7322680","7325740"," I always like people are like, you can't do that, but then they just did it."
"7334950","7337870"," People are calling Twitter a public utility. "
"7339290","7340750"," It's fucking crazy town."
"7350400","7360940"," Look at this here."
"7367860","7377700"," They got someone posted a live shot"
"7377700","7381100"," of employees on their way to Twitter at HQ and it's all the fucking trolls. "
"7381920","7385540"," It's hilarious."
"7387860","7397840"," A little bit of a curve higher on a little bit of a curling nice trade on oil"
"7397840","7405780"," on USO and BNO."
"7414440","7417220"," Spies still kind of fucking around down here, not doing too much, right?"
"7417880","7420860"," I was thinking about taking that trade down here, a bounce trade. "
"7421500","7422200"," I haven't entered it yet."
"7425420","7427940"," I was going to find some in the money, 441 C's."
"7432080","7432980"," I'm going to take a quick break. "
"7433440","7435040"," It's 1237."
"7435340","7438440"," I'm going to take a 20-minute break, get some lunch, and I'll come back with you."
"7439100","7441180"," I'm not expecting any big power moves in the spy. "
"7441580","7443420"," Still, still not expecting any big power moves."
"7444160","7449260"," If you think we're going to continue to trade down below into the clothes here, there's some pretty"
"7449260","7451600"," big SPX puts coming out right now."
"7452300","7458420"," So if we get trade down here, maybe I'm still waiting to pick up my put spreads. "
"7459300","7461900"," Hopefully I can get some of those today above here."
"7462500","7463840"," If I missed the trade, I missed the trade."
"7464000","7465980"," I'll be fine with no trades into the weekend. "
"7466240","7468220"," It's Easter, a nice three-day weekend."
"7471720","7473000"," So let me know in the chat what you guys are doing."
"7480390","7481330"," Hello, sir, when pumped. "
"7482670","7485250"," Not until I'm done getting my sandwich, then we'll pump it."
"7489070","7490090"," I'm always doubting."
"7490450","7491630"," Always doubting. "
"7492230","7493330"," I'll be doubting."
"7494290","7494730"," It's relax."
"7495270","7495490"," Chill. "
"7495790","7496310"," It's chill Friday."
"7497190","7498850"," You got wait till summertime comes."
"7499190","7502370"," When summertime comes, man, we're going to have days where we're going to do all kinds of other"
"7502370","7502670"," shit. "
"7503650","7505010"," We're going to do classrooms and shit."
"7506010","7508170"," We're going to have some slow-ass days in the summer months."
"7509030","7512030"," We trade in fucking butterflies and condors and Clorox and stuff. "
"7513450","7514290"," Screaming at the screen."
"7515950","7516890"," But what's that down there?"
"7517170","7519270"," Got the same place, 438 down here."
"7520750","7523290"," Looks like the buyers stepped up from 438. "
"7523710","7524590"," Try to buy this bottom."
"7534990","7536490"," Those buyers right there."
"7538230","7540490"," And there's more buyers right here. "
"7540630","7542170"," You can see them hiding right here, 438."
"7543070","7543990"," See if this holds."
"7544170","7546130"," If it doesn't, next price target, 438. "
"7547570","7553190"," If 440 can't hold, price target below 438."
"7553690","7555270"," I'll leave this up while I'm gone."
"7556070","7557770"," So you can see 438 down here. "
"7557890","7559790"," There's a wave of sellers coming on right now."
"7560470","7563010"," They're trying to get that lower bound at 438."
"7571800","7573720"," Price target, 438 at this point. "
"7575000","7577520"," You can see the wall of sellers over here on the right-hand side."
"7578780","7580200"," They're trying to break support."
"7582420","7583180"," I'll be right back. "
"7583340","7586140"," I'm just going to take a quick break and I'll get back with you here in the next 20 minutes."
"7586260","7587040"," Leave back by 1pm."
"7621120","7622200"," Hey, one more thing. "
"7622360","7627000"," I just want to give a shout out to Richard Bruck for supporting the channel and also 77"
"7627000","7628260"," Konstantinos."
"7628740","7629740"," Thanks for subscribing."
"7629740","7630400"," I appreciate it. "
"7710360","7715300"," On the North American Trade Front, Singer reported that Mexican truckers have ended their initial"
"7715300","7717680"," border blockade and are now shifting elsewhere."
"8011720","8016120"," It's going to stop in here for a minute and just show that price target down below is still 438."
"8017200","8018520"," Take a look at it down here. "
"8021420","8022220"," Right here."
"8198360","8203440"," Dude, fucking USO and fucking Bieno is still cranking, right?"
"8204379","8205520"," Bieno, not as much."
"8205760","8209500"," We thought that would happen, but USO just keeps blasting towards 80 bucks. "
"8210360","8224110"," Just pin strike at 78.87. Also"
"8224110","8226730"," still watching the creepy crawly here on the spy."
"8227510","8231049"," We'll see if it can just slowly drag its down to 438."
"8246129","8248070"," It's a little bit of a bump in the road right here. "
"8248150","8250209"," You can see these buyers stepping in down here."
"8258370","8261049"," As you can see down here, this is where the buyers really are."
"8261070","8262290"," You can see this is weak support. "
"8262910","8268790"," It's a little bit better support down in this area, 438.60ish. The buyers still waiting down even"
"8268790","8269650"," farther below down."
"8269809","8270790"," This is actually not for it."
"8270850","8271389"," Yeah, it's 438. "
"8750790","8755830"," We're in the treasury yield hitting its size level since May 2019."

"8800370","8800750"," Shit tons."
"8801070","8802530"," He was rekind of four to six."
"8802530","8806430"," Watch that unusual call activity earlier, now seeing SPX calls come in. "
"8806810","8812050"," Twitter calls, more oxy calls, but substantial Twitter calls coming in right now."
"8812090","8813270"," I don't know if there's any news coming out."
"8813390","8814730"," I just made myself some lunch. "
"8818160","8846480"," We'll recount up two at 548, natural gas, recount up four at 1.43. Definitely"
"8846480","8850200"," on Twitter, the meme pumpers are just out of control on Twitter right now."
"8851100","8851720"," I don't know why."
"8851900","8853380"," I'm not finding any news yet. "
"8853580","8855800"," I can see that I'm seeing them any reason for it."
"8856340","8901620"," It's pretty crazy"
"8901620","8902100"," right now."
"8902160","8905940"," I'm reading some of the shit that's being posted on Twitter about the Twitter deal because"
"8905940","8907360"," absolutely fucking batshit insane. "
"9160390","9166010"," So I'm eating my lunch and I'm looking through the fucking Twitter posts on Twitter, right?"
"9167550","9171450"," I swear to fuck, it looks like it looks like stock twits."
"9173210","9175170"," That's how fucking crazy it is."
"9295220","9299520"," USO now trading to 79.16. We put a price target on for 80 bucks. "
"9302400","9304040"," B&O looks like keeps trucking along."
"9304040","9304800"," Just slower."
"9306000","9308340"," I think we put a price target of 32 on that. "
"9309400","9314260"," Quick bounce on the spy, but still have that price target down below 438."
"9315220","9316580"," Still looking for that price."
"9318080","9320620"," Looks like the buyers are still down there. "
"9320680","9323460"," We'll take a closer look and see if they're down there."
"9329610","9331910"," They're still hiding out down here at 438."
"9332330","9335150"," 437.98. Some more. "
"9335310","9337510"," Another band of buyers in here at 439."
"9342420","9344020"," Really weird trading today."
"9344260","9347580"," Well, I'm watching individual tickers and then of course, Twitter. "
"9351690","9355570"," Twitter looks like just a big pump and dump skit scheme for the rest of today."
"9357690","9359670"," Take a look around here and see what I can see."
"9366310","9370330"," Twitter rolling over slightly now, but they had a little someone grabbed the dip down here. "
"9371010","9373610"," We saw that one set of calls come in earlier."
"9374310","9380390"," That those unusual calls that came in, they came in at 1258 PM."
"9386870","9387630"," No, wait a minute. "
"9387710","9388390"," Not 1258."
"9388570","9389450"," It came in earlier than that."
"9391810","9393630"," Let me see where the first set came in. "
"9394630","9401970"," First, the first unusual options came in at looks like 1246."
"9404670","9406430"," It was the first set that came in."
"9407610","9409410"," No, it was at 1222. "
"9411250","9412610"," I can't remember this now."
"9412850","9415130"," It was at 1222 this afternoon right here."
"9416290","9417050"," I'll show it to you here. "
"9418970","9428850"," So at 1222, we alerted on some calls that came in"
"9428850","9431650"," on on options.ai. It was the first set."
"9431830","9433690"," They came with up there, blue highlighted."
"9434050","9437890"," They were May 650C, parent $12,000. "
"9438390","9440070"," It looks like it was a pretty decent print on that trade."
"9442070","9446430"," And then we of course got more calls that came in later on, but look, quick pump."
"9446430","9453270"," If we see this roll again and we see more another batch of calls come in, we'll pay attention to"
"9453270","9453430"," it. "
"9456130","9457930"," It's unusual in one respect."
"9458950","9461690"," This could just be though day traders, meme pumpers."
"9462090","9467210"," I was looking through Twitter posts on Twitter and it's a fucking shit show. "
"9468050","9469110"," Plain and simple."
"9470270","9475390"," Another thought process too would be that banks might have wanted to get in."
"9477050","9478830"," Get out of their shorts down below here. "
"9479130","9480370"," Let's say and then take it long."
"9481750","9484390"," Could be adding fuel to the fire to a higher trade."
"9485490","9486950"," It's the close today as well. "
"9487250","9488330"," Combination of those kind of things."
"9488370","9494230"," Just be aware of this trade right here because we still have lots of calls rolling in on it even"
"9494230","9494550"," now."
"9495570","9498130"," Maybe the last last set was at 103. "
"9499570","9500970"," So nine minutes ago."
"9502350","9503790"," It's consolidating right now."
"9505330","9507130"," Some pretty big fucking moves right here. "
"9525460","9529060"," And I come back on screen here."
"9532040","9542100"," I was able to make my daughter made some pasta and I broke out and made some puts"
"9542100","9543200"," want to put me in a food coma."
"9545640","9548020"," Make a nice small bowl of ketchup peppy. "
"9551660","9552060"," Excellent."
"9552060","9552980"," You've never had it."
"9553160","9553680"," It's worth it. "
"9555060","9555920"," So let's take a look."
"9556120","9558760"," Spy looks like it's trying to regain some traction here."
"9561020","9562360"," Trying to find some kind of a bottom. "
"9563120","9564100"," We've seen this happen already."
"9564300","9566180"," This is like the inverse of yesterday, right?"
"9566360","9572360"," We saw so just like inverse of yesterday, right?"
"9572480","9573240"," I attempt to go higher."
"9575300","9576340"," Failure, right?"
"9580060","9582140"," We're trading out of range at this point. "
"9582380","9585140"," We were down at taking one point at point eighty percent."
"9585140","9587200"," So that's outside of the implied move for today."
"9589080","9590600"," Just kind of burning down here. "
"9591020","9594240"," Looks like the same thing is taking place again down here, right?"
"9594500","9599040"," Looks like we're getting another one of these bear flags up here."
"9603850","9605990"," For the possibly another drop down."
"9606170","9610150"," I don't know if we go down here up here much too interested in this trade at all today. "
"9611130","9613590"," I've made my money wrap fucking belt, to be honest with you."
"9614450","9616430"," And I'm still looking to get some put spreads."
"9616590","9618810"," I'm hoping I can get them somewhere up in here towards end of day. "
"9622080","9622900"," Hello and second here."
"9636430","9638110"," We got like session disconnected."
"9638610","9639610"," We're just going on here. "
"9640490","9640910"," Okay."
"9642610","9647030"," So it looks like every time we we consolidate, we're just selling off, consolidate, selling off,"
"9647070","9648130"," consolidate, selling off."
"9648490","9652070"," Still valid price target down below 438 down here. "
"9653810","9656190"," So we can get another another trade down below."
"9656430","9658590"," Might be another another good trade for you to take."
"9659250","9661190"," My concern is always the squeeze. "
"9661510","9662650"," There's a little bit of a squeeze in here."
"9662710","9663750"," I don't like these squeezes."
"9664070","9665350"," I'm only getting trapped in here. "
"9666970","9668670"," Now some have no interest in this."
"9668790","9669390"," It was a spread."
"9669530","9672650"," I'd be interested in this, but I missed the trade up here to this morning. "
"9674230","9676830"," So I'm just gonna I'm just gonna buy my time down in the day."
"9676930","9681450"," If I don't get a spread on today, then I'm fine with waiting till Monday."
"9682550","9688390"," The last thing though, I will deal with you guys today at some point as we'll start taking a look"
"9688390","9689610"," at some spreads for next week. "
"9690150","9692230"," It's probably the best place to be looking at them."
"9692550","9694890"," So we'll I'm gonna be look I'm hoping we can get up here again."
"9696330","9704330"," And then we'll look at putting on some spreads for Friday expiry Monday expiry and then out to May"
"9704330","9705410"," and then June as well. "
"9707330","9711850"," I don't think I'll be looking at June, but like late May after the 20th 18th or so."
"9714250","9715490"," That's the anniversary cooperation."
"9716090","9717150"," 79 kind of party's digging. "
"9718030","9719650"," One sponsor and one trillion dollars."
"9738880","9740520"," It was an eight little Twitter trade though."
"9742240","9743420"," Oil trade is banging. "
"9744300","9745960"," USO trade starting to roll over now."
"9746060","9747040"," It's 79 and 34."
"9748460","9749680"," We'll take a look at oil art. "
"9749820","9750480"," USO real quick."
"9750740","9751820"," See if it can continue up or not."
"9753160","9755820"," See if it's resting or did get that hard rejection up there. "
"9755820","9763990"," If the sellers came down below, it's pretty close to a pin strike, horseshoes and hand grenades."
"9776120","9781860"," I don't know if you can get hair indicator on this one, but we'll see."
"9783640","9785840"," I don't think this is a hair indicator on USO. "
"9786220","9787320"," Yeah, you can see it right up here."
"9789800","9796320"," So figure, you know, sellers are swooping down, I'm assuming at some point right at this $80 mark."
"9798100","9799980"," There might be one more push here you can get. "
"9805990","9807430"," Still more buyers and sellers."
"9809810","9819120"," So you might get a you might get some kind of another push higher."
"9822340","9827060"," Looks like right there. "
"9828400","9829760"," See if we can get another bounce."
"9831520","9834500"," I think I want to say the $80 is still viable."
"9834580","9847290"," Probably what will happen is you'll you'll test it a couple more times and feed"
"9847290","9849030"," in some sellers coming down from above. "
"9852670","9862950"," V-Waps at 78.76. Snap a line at 78.76. Pretty"
"9862950","9863210"," low."
"9865570","9871590"," It's how far down V-Wap is, but I still think we try to tag, or at least, you know,"
"9872030","9881320"," if you've got sellers above here, still a long way to go, still for oil."
"9882480","9886700"," Even with that huge move, still a ways to go. "
"9888420","9889980"," Kind of wild to come with this right now."
"9893320","9894520"," We can still see."
"9897440","9898880"," The grind higher happening. "
"9900420","9901740"," So $80 price target."
"9902620","9905080"," It is a big sell area above."
"9905200","9910680"," Just say now you'll see sellers come down and then feed into this here. "
"9911680","9916540"," We get another, I don't know what that is, $0.60 or so, $0.70 to go."
"9921500","9922740"," There's a little bit of support right here."
"9922940","9924920"," That's why I put, that's why I stopped that. "
"9924920","9928280"," I've got a little tiny bit of support right here."
"9929240","9930060"," You guys can see it."
"9931560","9933140"," There's a little level of support right here. "
"9933880","9935160"," We'll see right there."
"9939330","9940650"," There's a little bump right here."
"9941150","9943290"," A little bump right there, right there. "
"9946230","9946670"," There."
"9948550","9949450"," Can be a little bit higher."
"9951210","9953510"," We'll take a look up and book map and see exactly where it's at. "
"9953510","9957990"," So we got, we tagged 79.02. Let's take a look and see."
"9960650","9962130"," There's a little bit of support right here."
"9962210","9962650"," You see it here. "
"9963310","9967190"," The 79.02. And down here, it's 70."
"9967690","9972870"," Maybe snap a line at 78.22. A firmer support."
"9973330","9974170"," Here's that b-wop. "
"9974930","9980570"," The 78.79. I still like to trade $80."
"9980570","9982190"," It'll feed into sellers."
"9982630","9984610"," So they'll probably try to tap it once or twice more. "
"9986050","9992090"," No, always, but sometimes you'll get a couple taps, a couple of retests for sellers to come down."
"9992990","9994190"," You can see them hiding up here."
"10019020","10022660"," I'll also take note that a hair indicator is turning green on the spy. "
"10025890","10028090"," And you get a lot of buyers in here, two real money buyers."
"10028450","10030370"," You can see the green, all nice green balls setting up."
"10032270","10042040"," The oil's making that other stab for it"
"10042040","10042280"," again. "
"10043180","10044800"," Try to make that move up to 80 again."
"10061660","10063060"," Another retest down here."
"10063220","10064880"," $4.39. This is where that support was previously. "
"10065300","10067940"," $4.39.76 or so."
"10072160","10073540"," Real money's still down below it."
"10073660","10074600"," $4.38 on the spy. "
"10085920","10088440"," And VIX is kind of just fucking around basing itself, right?"
"10089520","10091360"," Just fucking around around 2085."
"10113820","10117480"," It doesn't see a musk now appearing at the Ted Conference Live."

"12468070","12474410"," if I was shorting Tesla I would take away from that conversation that the deal's not gonna happen"
"12474410","12482950"," for multiple reasons right the key point though is that Elon Musk is saying that he's unwilling to"
"12482950","12491750"," spend more than the $52 or whatever 52 and change 40 cents whatever that shit is and if that's the"
"12491750","12498110"," case right it probably does prove some of some of my commenters are saying today about the deal"

"12837530","12843250"," take a safe you a safer trade you probably take a 445 you don't have to take this trade but"
"12843250","12853250"," and we know the lower bound is probably 434 438 excuse me right"
"12853250","12862390"," we saw bounce on 440 last week three times right so we'll look at four we'll look to capture all"
"12862390","12872150"," of it let's see put spread"
"12872150","12881730"," expires this upcoming Friday in the 22nd 481 bucks we'll net you a thousand bucks we can we can"
"12881730","12886190"," look at it here and this is what we're trading currently we just have to close down here right this"
"12886190","12891590"," will show your gains right your how many what your gains are gonna be your max gains a thousand"
"12891590","12897410"," bucks if we close down here especially we need time to pass as well so and so ideally we do"
"12897410","12907220"," like a Thursday we'd hit this probability of profits 44% for next week"
"12907220","12914300"," right we'll get some profit in here we'll get 600 we'll make 600 bucks if we close where is that"
"12914300","12924120"," at it's this price here let me take a look here"
"12927740","12937280"," at 430 anything below 439 74 we're making money that's pretty good heading into next week to Friday"
"12937280","12944760"," now the the the problem here is you know do we trade higher and come down soon enough in the"
"12944760","12951920"," next Friday so we'll we'll look at a look at a Monday trade a Monday trade with 25th right maybe"
"12951920","12957660"," they don't print 430 next week maybe it's maybe it's the week maybe it's the following week on that"
"12957660","12967360"," Monday some debt put spreads we'll look at some other couple things here"
"12967360","12974840"," we're gonna credit spread to this is where we are we could you can change this up right don't"
"12974840","12979500"," actually execute this trade you could wait to execute it to whenever whenever you want to execute"
"12979500","12987300"," it you can wait for the end of the day in case you get squeezed 430 save the strike"
"12987300","12999870"," pretty fair right 491 to make a thousand bucks pretty fucking good that's for Monday we can"
"12999870","13007450"," look at a credit call spread if you want right 510 for 390 441 450 450 451 you're not risking"
"13007450","13014910"," a whole ton here this is just time for Monday right then it closes we could do this for Friday"
"13014910","13021920"," as well but for 76 bucks you make $24 just saying that you're gonna close you you probably wouldn't"
"13021920","13027700"," want to make this for Monday you want to make this for Friday and as long as you close below"
"13027700","13036120"," you know 450 you're gonna make $23 80% chance of probably a profit if you have a bearish outlook"
"13036120","13042100"," the other thing I want to look at with you would be that May 18th or May 20th I remember"
"13042100","13046940"," Winky was talking about you know like we've got the 18th right but in there's a bunch of interest"
"13046940","13051580"," on the 20th so we'll do is a look at the well how about this the when's the FOMC meeting"
"13051580","13060120"," in May we get a date on that let's get exact here because you know what usually happens to sell"
"13060120","13068890"," the news right let me see FOMC meetings I'm gonna take a look here"
"13068890","13078880"," 2022 here it's saying what's the May calendar saying mark may maybe they got"
"13078880","13088630"," an FOMC minutes on May 3rd and 4th and then do I get this wrong I thought there was a"
"13088630","13096130"," the meeting in like 18th of the 20th do I have the dates wrong here my smoke and crack or"
"13096130","13111810"," something hold on here Fed"
"13111810","13120190"," calendar the other on dates on this"
"13120190","13129830"," I do both I take I take I take my typically I take those tighter spreads I usually go like"
"13129830","13136390"," one strike out I don't take like 10 strikes or anything like that normally for me personally I'm"
"13136390","13147340"," just trying to show you guys some examples here Fed calendar May FOMC"
"13147340","13157200"," meetings submit so yeah I forgot about I didn't know it was on the foot on the fourth"
"13157200","13162060"," so we've got the meeting on the fourth FOMC meeting today meeting May 3rd and 4th they have the"
"13162060","13167380"," minutes on May 3rd and 4th maybe got this wrong I'm fucking this all up aren't I maybe sooner than"
"13167380","13171840"," I thought it was I kept harping on the 18th but it's the fourth so I must be making a"
"13171840","13178970"," huge mistake here yeah it's May 20th oh the OPEC is on the 20th that's something I'm fucking this"
"13178970","13186430"," up right now I'm talking to you guys so that you got FOMC meeting on May on May 3rd and"
"13186430","13192470"," 4th that's important to know so we could we could get a we could get a push down into May"
"13192470","13202290"," 3rd and 4th so let's look at that strike May 2nd and 4th that sucks"
"13202290","13209290"," maybe make it for the 4th generate some trades we'll get some you get some volatility head in the"
"13209290","13223670"," May 4th guaranteed so 441 429 that's not"
"13223670","13229750"," that's not a bad though that's not a bad trade right there 350 for 850 that's actually good trade"
"13229750","13237190"," right where it's at it's a really nice trade I like that trade a lot that's the FOMC meeting which"
"13237190","13244950"," is Wednesday May 4th that's a bang and trade right there I don't know if I do 441 I might"
"13244950","13252170"," do like 445 or something but 441 it puts them two on that trade too I like that trade I"
"13252170","13255830"," like it where it's at maybe for maybe maybe 430 I"
"13255830","13265020"," fucking like that trade right now"
"13265020","13275750"," then we get OPEC's for May right we'll talk about oil pecs May 20th"
"13275750","13285730"," right we'll look at May 27th too some nice"
"13285730","13293050"," sexiness in here too now that not as juicy"
"13293050","13301080"," 441 424 I don't think we get there"
"13301080","13310960"," it's still not a bad trade right 300 bucks for 764 it's pretty fucking good I"
"13310960","13316060"," think you know the good part about putting time on these trades too is you have to think about"
"13316060","13321020"," where we are currently we're at 441 right now it gives you time for us to trade higher and then"
"13321020","13326720"," come back down and hit that price target right it gives you a couple opportunities probably between"
"13326720","13334250"," now and the 20th to hit this I don't think this is unreasonable I don't think that's unreasonable"
"13334250","13343330"," I am interested though more in the FOMC and the 4th and the OPEC's on the 20th I really am"
"13343330","13348350"," I'm we're now I'm interested in May 4th because it dude if they get that shut up I mean once"
"13348350","13356090"," that volatility leaves the market we could fucking go boom go crazy higher I know well pecs is"
"13356090","13365170"," typically weak as well just like it was this week right and that is the 20th"
"13365170","13371930"," and now the time we're gonna be week next week right going next week so let's look at like Monday"
"13371930","13382130"," applied move is only 4% I always like"
"13382130","13387510"," these to these four forty four sixty credit spreads these are beautiful things too there's a room"
"13387510","13392590"," up here so you don't get fucked up and then come back down here just over time do you think"
"13392590","13399310"," is your give a bearish viewpoint into OPEC's from May you think will be lower than 450 come May"
"13399310","13407250"," 23rd probably it's pretty good pretty decent trade I always like credit spreads to because you can"
"13407250","13412710"," if we trade higher at any point you can cut one leg off and then ride it right back down"
"13412710","13417750"," for the rest of it that we take root futures at the highs of the afternoon 106 70 with less"
"13417750","13424690"," than 15 minutes now to the close of picturing bouncing around here made a nice little bounce up"
"13424690","13430250"," ahead you guys have been high as well at 2.8 to 7% up about 13 basis points on"
"13430250","13438170"," the day and so what's the what what are we looking at here right we're looking at the spy has"
"13438170","13447570"," to say and they expect some weakness into next week I would"
"13447570","13451910"," say I'll say we should be able to get up here you know we I would like to take a"
"13451910","13459870"," short I'd prefer to take a short somewhere up in here I might not get my wish their point is"
"13459870","13467690"," that we're gonna fucking start we're gonna start fucking selling this into next week and if they're"
"13467690","13476850"," not saying we're getting a 420 they're saying that we're gonna they're saying at any point today"
"13476850","13482830"," we're gonna roll this this down into next week and get down here and start trading this zone down"
"13482830","13488270"," here next week totally Germany is considering securing additional floating liquid natural gas"
"13488270","13503110"," terminals you know it's crazy too is that if the FMC meeting is is in the third let's say"
"13503110","13508850"," we start selling that let's say we just start selling and trading down here as we get closer I mean"
"13508850","13512630"," we get my other thought my first thought was that my first thought was that would be weak until"
"13512630","13517270"," next week if we can get weak into next week that we would actually trade higher right I think I"
"13517270","13522530"," said that we'd trade higher to 450 or 460 and they come down for the 18th but if it's on"
"13522530","13528630"," the third over here I mean shit we're probably not getting that high probably it probably are not"
"13528630","13537490"," this is all fucking leading into the third isn't it yeah"
"13541370","13553370"," she could get nasty we could stay we could just keep trading here this get real fucking nasty hmm I"
"13553370","13558150"," don't think there's any way we're breaking out of this this wedge with the with the meeting coming"
"13558150","13568130"," up in the third 13 days I'm doubt it FSG say we're gonna be"
"13568130","13573370"," weak on Monday but that that's their expectation even if we weren't weak maybe we're weak and then"
"13573370","13584150"," we bust back up here and head into the third I guess or something like well maybe not that trade"
"13584150","13594670"," somewhere down here and then to the third it relation moved down in here so"
"13594670","13600430"," I guess I was gonna put a put spread on I'd put my if I gave you if I was"
"13600430","13604770"," gonna take I'm gonna take this trade with you today at some point today I'm gonna take a trade for"
"13604770","13614570"," the fourth and I'm gonna I'm gonna look for this zone here in here"
"13614570","13623810"," so I'll have at least I'll have at least one and a second chance at it right so this is"
"13623810","13627750"," like trying to account for us be if let's say that let's say the trade actually goes up on Monday"
"13627750","13632390"," I'm going to be looking for at least one shot at that put spread printing and then a second shot"
"13632390","13637350"," at that put spread printing so see how I'm starting to think about this stuff my own self like what"
"13637350","13643170"," am I gonna do here I don't really care if I haven't put spread out if we trade higher and"
"13643170","13651550"," then reject if we do it on Monday and start selling off it'll print if I can buy some calls"
"13651550","13657870"," if we're going up here on Monday Tuesday and then I'll iron fist or you know diamond hand note that"
"13657870","13663070"," put spread as my protection and even if we don't come down here there's I have a second shot at"
"13663070","13670390"," coming down here into little just the apple I'm seeing meeting will be enough and the minutes come"
"13670390","13677950"," out right after it to me I look at that schedule real quick and see what the other a calendar"
"13677950","13686950"," also has we have the minutes coming out to I don't know if that's after before I'm gonna take"
"13686950","13697710"," a"
"13697710","13707640"," look me a second here look at this again yeah may look at"
"13707640","13718450"," that submit hold on a second here we also"
"13718450","13724170"," have to the F over C meeting on the fourth then we've got the F over C minutes on the"
"13724170","13734990"," 25th of May to the vault another vault ball day so you could look for yeah I"
"13734990","13738630"," think I want to take this spread I think I want to take this spread if that's if it's on"
"13738630","13747290"," the fourth I think we'll still get some volatility into the third so two shots at it I'll take what"

"14432790","14439670"," earnings estimates are lower than last quarters beware of the effect of tech starting is prudent"
"14439670","14443950"," but this is very helpful discussion yeah I think the discussion is worth us having together right"
"14443950","14451610"," to look at all of all the ramifications Myrna and Uber is on the fourth"
"14451610","14458390"," most of the juice for that spread will probably gone after the big tech earnings I wish you the"

"14501440","14511130"," you saying because earnings won't matter until FMC what if majority of companies"
"14511130","14519310"," absolutely destroy ER we just had that happen did you guys know it you guys remember you guys have"
"14519310","14529290"," you guys don't have you guys have you guys have short memories do you guys remember"

"14545790","14553570"," see it I'm not saying that we don't go up once in April towards the end of April I was"
"14553570","14559890"," thinking that we would go up once more time in April my point was that my point was that this"
"14559890","14566930"," week right that we should have a down my point was we'd have a down week here right trade higher"
"14566930","14572390"," and then roll the market over into the fourth and what what you know what makes sense on this to"
"14572390","14581250"," me too is well is a Q1 earnings season we just did just that didn't we we did just that"
"14581250","14585570"," right we traded high into the beginning of earnings season then we started rolling over in earnings"
"14585570","14592750"," season and down you guys remember all this Q1 2022 you guys remember to roll over we had in the"
"14592750","14602720"," market my point though in this trade is that I can cash out of this trade here and I can"
"14602720","14607520"," cash out of this trade down the road here I don't need to cash out and that in the end"
"14607520","14614660"," that the spread is worth the same in both areas it'll print once it'll print twice out my of course"
"14614660","14621140"," whether monetize them but I've got two chances at it is my point it doesn't matter if the fucking"
"14621140","14625960"," it doesn't matter if we go up tomorrow or excuse me on Monday and then come back down and then"
"14625960","14632040"," do this kind of nonsense over here the only other argument that would be would be or one of the"
"14632040","14637600"," arguments is what if you have got a like ass blaster earning season for tech we did we had a"
"14637600","14643360"," good earning season believe it or not at the beginning of the year and the markets still rolled"
"14643360","14650280"," over as a matter of fact someone I trust or someone I trust a ton right you guys know who"
"14650280","14661240"," I'm talking about he said that the that earning season won't roll over that"
"14661240","14666080"," we won't have roll over at all during earning season they'll let the earnings come out then they'll"
"14666080","14670220"," roll it over they'll wait until you guys know I'm not gonna sit name names or shit because people"
"14670220","14676940"," shit out for that I thought I thought he had had some logic to I agreed with his I with"
"14676940","14686720"," his point but we still rolled over and this is this is huge volatility down here let it doubt so"
"14686720","14691780"," I don't I'm not saying that we don't come up I think that we get weak this week and then"
"14691780","14699660"," we come back up and then we trade down something like this and I'll chart this out for you I'll"
"14699660","14705440"," try this out for you next week so that you can see where I think we're going or how the"
"14705440","14709920"," earnings season starts then we start to see that roll over down into here and the other crazy thing"
"14709920","14719880"," too is the companies are reporting right around here a lot of retail is reporting down in here so I"
"14719880","14724980"," don't know I think we've got two shots at that at that print there and then day trade the entire"
"14724980","14731680"," thing right so even though we're holding this but spread we're still gonna trade if we bounce and"
"14731680","14735920"," trade up here we'll still keep trading it higher we'll trade to the right every day and then just"
"14735920","14746060"," look for monetization down here and down here and these these two these two times get rid of"
"14746060","14752100"," this and I'm and I'm still I was talking to you guys sworn about an all-time high attack for"
"14752100","14760270"," for 60 or 480 above here I still think that's even a risk a bull risk that we trade that"
"14760270","14767490"," high and then come back down believe it or not but I can trade that I can trade that while"
"14767490","14775970"," still holding this this put spread over here wish I'd fucking bought it back over here yesterday"
"14775970","14782950"," I'm gonna take a look real quick at the calls that are coming to the market today I'm still gonna"
"14782950","14786830"," wait to place this trade until the end of the day I just want to I just want to watch"
"14786830","14793450"," the stuff that's coming in to the market the bid that's coming in the market to the end of the"
"14793450","14803310"," day 30 million dollars against the queues 90 million dollars into the SPX"
"14803310","14809870"," so SPX a little bit stronger than a little bit stronger than matter of fact a ton of that money"
"14809870","14819030"," came in for the for September not for not for this month so it's gonna support the markets today"
"14820860","14827900"," individual tickers all have some good bids in them today I like that anticipate that but the"
"14827900","14837840"," indexes themselves is the question that I'm asking about and all I have to do is have it people low"
"14837840","14845580"," 445 heading into OPEC I think we do I don't think you're trying to like I'm finding it hard to"
"14845580","14850600"," believe that you're gonna say they're coming into the fourth I guess this is where the risk is"
"14850600","14859280"," right you're saying that we're gonna trade higher 460 and then we maybe you'll bounce on 445 at"
"14859280","14864000"," OPEC this is what you're saying right something like this is this is where the risk is right on"
"14864000","14873770"," that trade and then once the ball comes off we we come back up right let me tell you if"
"14873770","14880930"," it to be PS sell the news I think there's this risk here put not I think what I can"
"14880930","14887650"," do to mitigate this is where I was talking about in Twitter last night is buy those penny calls as"
"14887650","14895270"," a tail risk a bullish tail risk that we trade our way up here so you buy the puts reds"
"14895270","14902310"," then you buy some penny penny calls I bet some I bet some penny calls up in here like I"
"14902310","14910410"," bet you that they're held a cheap like May 25th or 26th excuse me April 20 probably April 29th"
"14910410","14917610"," strike it gets some zip some penny calls up here at 460 or 480 somewhere in here and buy those"
"14917610","14925590"," put spreads and if the calls just get wrecked then I don't care if they print they're gonna print"
"14925590","14934330"," fucking thousands of percent maybe that's the trade so that's the trade they're gonna put on today"
"14934330","14943790"," what I'll do before it of day is I'll put on put spread towards end of day for"
"14943790","14953590"," May 4th and then I'm going to also place a trade today"
"14953590","14962970"," with some small money and buy some let me take a look and see what they cost right now"
"14962970","14970890"," what I say May 29th or April"
"14977520","14988790"," 29th keep"
"14988790","14998430"," a 32 cents for 70 C's or 4"
"14998430","15007890"," cents so that's what I would probably do I'd probably I'd probably buy April 29th I don't know they"
"15007890","15017750"," might not move fast enough maybe I'll buy some 460 C's for like 32 cents for April 29th"
"15018790","15030680"," score I could buy for 70s like a week later into May and those are actually gained value I'll think"
"15030680","15036860"," about this trade it's either gonna be for 60s or for 70s and I'll place a put spread as well"
"15036860","15049760"," cover both sides hot hot"

"15077560","15082960"," eight cents the only problem is that I don't I don't think it'll go it's too far outside the money"
"15082960","15090460"," for it'll wait it won't start gaining until we actually hit 460 so I might as well just buy some"
"15090460","15100240"," 460 calls for for April 29th so I'll buy some 460 C's for April 29th for a bull risk and"

"17078810","17085610"," like everybody was in live stream saying that you can't trade the spy from four to four fifteen and"
"17085610","17091050"," that you can't trade like you guys can't trade any like I don't know who uses Robinhood out there"

"17137770","17147540"," the point"
"17147540","17152160"," behind this challenge that really a challenge I called it like the thousand two million dollar"
"17152160","17157800"," challenge I want to be clear here under norm there's two reasons there was a bunch of reasons to"

"17162980","17169660"," Zingostle from market is very tight inflation is very elevated that will trim support at a pace"
"17169660","17176320"," that sells his demand and supplies his master no trim support to control prices and sustain the"
"17176320","17185550"," expansion the reason for this trade is I want to give you guys a tool to consistently make money so"
"17185550","17192030"," that you can then go and find your favorite chip stock and piss away your money there so like if"
"17192030","17197630"," you lose money to trade and tesla you lose money trade and fucking roblox you lose money you know"
"17197630","17203350"," fucking around on zero dates with spy or whatever you do that you least have a tool to consistently"
"17203350","17209230"," make money and this is how what I use to consistently make money now there's other things I'm going"
"17209230","17215150"," to try to teach in this trade I want to teach you how to trade simple spreads right so we'll"
"17215150","17219310"," do them together I know a lot of you trade on Robin Hood so mr."
"17220330","17225150"," prepared remarks she does not comment on how fast the pensionaries interest rates though previously"

"17231990","17239270"," by the end of the year so the few things in here like I want to be able to place"
"17239270","17244630"," these trades on something that you use and then eventually I want to move you over and off of Robin"
"17244630","17250510"," Hood and into a better broker like tasty you don't have to but we're gonna move those trades over"
"17250510","17257490"," to tasty at some point but the other thing some things wrapped up in this is that what you guys"
"17257490","17263650"," have this tool so you can manage the stress manage the timing when to take profits on these trades"
"17263650","17270470"," and so you know how to make consistent money now you shouldn't be trading this like all in 100%"
"17270470","17277430"," every time it does work if you're trying to build an account but at some point you should you know"
"17277430","17281650"," lower the trade I don't trade hundred percent all in every time when I take these trades but I do"
"17281650","17290230"," I do use a significant portion of my account in these trades and they usually come around once"
"17290230","17295550"," every month month and a half and you can usually take these trades with quite with good confidence"
"17295550","17301390"," that they're gonna print put in a time on these trades they're gonna eventually print but you have"
"17301390","17306150"," to be strict and disciplined in your approach you can't get greedy you'll miss a lot of kick-ass"
"17306150","17311370"," trades that you're like I know this trades gonna kick ass and I should take this trade but you"
"17311370","17316010"," should keep this always separate so you always have an account that grows and so that you always"
"17316010","17321750"," have money to go off into four A's in the stock market and I noticed that I had a few"
"17321750","17326850"," conversations with people that follow me people are friendly very friendly with two right that said"
"17326850","17331870"," hey cap I blew up my account back on this month or that month or you know I've got really"
"17331870","17341790"," fucked up along the way and so I feel like I'm doing a disservice by by not actually"
"17341790","17348730"," making these trades with you so that you can learn a firm way and how to make consistent money in"
"17348730","17353490"," this market this is this these are the speed these are basically the same trades that the banks"
"17353490","17360830"," make this is like this is like the JPM caller basically and this is how banks make money and this"
"17360830","17365550"," is how banks don't blow up not talking about long only fucking hedge funds I'm talking about like"
"17365550","17371490"," big banks that they're still here today after you know hundreds a couple hundred years or hundred"
"17371490","17377290"," years or whatever still here because not come 100 like a hundred years some of these banks but it's"
"17377290","17384070"," because they place these specific trades in the market that are that have a low risk of not of not"
"17384070","17388050"," printing so I want you guys to be able to not only do that I want you guys will do"
"17388050","17393590"," it and do it with large amounts of money and then when you figure this all out right we'll go"
"17393590","17399610"," through these trades together so that the one you can place this trade with confidence even though"
"17399610","17407810"," it's a high stress trade and then the second point behind this is that you feel confident and"
"17407810","17412410"," comfortable when you're making those trades I guess I don't maybe repeat myself on that one and"
"17412410","17419530"," then what else and then that way you shouldn't be blowing up your accounts that way if you say to"
"17419530","17423910"," me oh trade it or kept my fucked up a trade or I lost some money you'd at least say"
"17423910","17429470"," yeah but you know I've got this other account over here that's always got to always got me funded"
"17429470","17435730"," right now what now normally you would only you know you don't need going falls deep in this trade"
"17435730","17439110"," you should let me go in like if you're banks a million dollars you should only going in with this"
"17439110","17442710"," trade a hundred thousand dollars you shouldn't be going in this trade for the million fucking"
"17442710","17447630"," dollars every time because you're not going to win every single one but you are going to win most"
"17447630","17455950"," of the time you win seven to nine times a hundred percent print now you can win 10 straight"
"17455950","17463830"," and not miss on this trade but there's always that chance right they're gonna blow it all up so I"
"17463830","17470930"," there's a high chance that I'll blow this trade up at some point which is fine I don't mind blowing"
"17470930","17475270"," the trade up but I think I'll I think I'll be fine I think I'll make all ten trades without"
"17475270","17480790"," a without a single failure because of how it's structured but anyways even talking about that the"
"17480790","17485910"," point is though that if you know that you can make nine to ten trades or seven to ten trades"
"17485910","17493150"," consistently over and over and over again without failure right then you have that tool in your box"
"17493150","17500970"," that you should then be able to start doing that month in month out month in month out and that"
"17500970","17504630"," you should ever have a blown up account well you can blow up accounts could blow up your fucking I"

"17531110","17535750"," trades on spy or oh I'm gonna take out another fucking fifty grand and I'm gonna buy a dip in"
"17535750","17542030"," Tesla or oh this new fucking this new shit's launching over here some new fucking company I'm gonna"
"17542030","17546810"," risk all this money off you're using that in a separate account then you have your bank right this"
"17546810","17552230"," is your bank account this is that this is this is your purse the separate accounts and I want you"
"17552230","17557890"," guys to understand that concept trade that concept for with me with the for a year and and so that"

"17562770","17570490"," five ten twenty years and you can really dumb it down so that make it a simple dumb down fucking"
"17570490","17575250"," trade you can't fuck up and and there's but there's a bunch of mechanics in there and there's a"
"17575250","17579810"," bunch of timing in there you have to know and then the fact that part of this trade is when"
"17579810","17585370"," you place large trades like this they they're very stressful that's the biggest part you get"
"17585370","17591130"," panicky the market can swing in the wrong direction and you I've had I've placed these so one time"
"17591130","17598110"," I placed one of these trades and they didn't fucking print until like the day of you know so that's"

"17747630","17752830"," have to have an account that you know will never blow up or the chance of it blowing up is"
"17752830","17759590"," extremely low and you keep that money separate in my effect I want you guys to know out there you"
"17759590","17763750"," guys should have multiple accounts anyways even if you have a small count you should have like ten"
"17763750","17770010"," tasty trade accounts you should have like Robinhood accounts you should have a fucking take a swim"

"17829310","17834770"," trading account but I'm trading just the spy or my in my effect the reason why I close those but"
"17834770","17839050"," one of the reasons why I close those fucking spy calls today at the open was so that I could"
"17839050","17845750"," day trade Twitter so you fucking close the spy calls on the open to go trade Twitter right on this"
"17845750","17851130"," account and on that account that's all I trade right but day trading account like if I buy a spread"

"17926610","17932370"," when you guys are trading if you guys are taking a trade like especially in this market it's easier"
"17932370","17937630"," to take call spreads than it is right now in this market it's day traders paradise my point of"
"17937630","17943790"," trying to get to here is that when you guys are taking a short position let's say let's say let's"
"17943790","17948270"," say let's say not a short but a long position a long bear position let's say you're like okay I'm"

"17975670","17981430"," prints that on off chance right but you guys should always have some protection for your trades if"
"17981430","17987590"," you don't have protection for your cash market trades you how do you hedge so if you're not hedging"
"17987590","17993530"," in cash market you should either be hedging in in a futures globe X market be able to trade and"

"17999570","18004950"," like a over the night the war ends and Ukraine or something and you can't trade futures to cover"
"18004950","18010990"," that that short position or that put position like it's not a healthy way to trade you blow up"
