"91760","94920"," I am in some puts trying to make this as fast as possible with it. "

"99740","101940"," Okay, so we're going to do subscribers today."
"102340","107360"," So I'm going to leave the chat open, not members."
"107780","111080"," So if you're watching on, I'm going to do some of this stuff here. "
"111840","114200"," Some really weird shit going on YouTube today."
"115420","122840"," Okay, to yield rise to the highest in September 2022, up seven basis points on the day at four spot"
"122840","124120"," six one two percent."

"146600","150580"," We will be opening up the YouTube comments today. "
"153520","155180"," All you have to do is click subscribe."
"155520","156280"," It doesn't cost anything."
"157120","159820"," And you can join us in the chat today. "
"161760","163740"," It'll probably get a little out of control."
"165940","169580"," I'm sure it'll get out of control today or I think it'll get out of control of the comments."
"171460","173780"," So if you're joining us at the moment right now. "
"176120","178860"," Hey, where if you're joining us today, just be wary that."
"180420","182220"," There's a big stink going on on Reddit."
"182940","186600"," So I don't know what the YouTube chat is going to be like today. "
"188260","190600"," Check to make sure you've got a stream up here in Twitch."
"191300","191460"," Sweet."
"192360","193440"," Good morning, everybody. "
"194340","195720"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"198020","199240"," Have a look at a."
"201720","204940"," First off, the hourly trigger is a couple things."
"205160","206480"," I get some housekeeping notes."
"206820","210360"," So the contract role this morning is fucking up book map. "
"210500","211140"," I don't know why."
"211700","213940"," So I've got no book map for you to start the day."
"214620","216020"," You're going to get the trigger. "
"216880","218280"," For today over here."
"218420","220560"," Okay, so we'll be looking at the trigger over there."
"221200","224020"," We check out the trigger all day long today. "
"225420","228060"," Bulls need this hourly here to hold."
"228600","230300"," We are losing some velocity."
"231200","234540"," So I'm not I'm not impressed with this trigger today. "
"234840","236760"," We'll find out if it holds if it holds."
"237560","240540"," We'll keep squeezing if people keep buying puts."
"242540","243060"," Dealers. "
"243260","243600"," Oh, sweet."
"243720","244440"," I'm making money already."
"245540","246060"," Operation. "
"247300","250840"," If this if this daily trigger right here does not hold."
"253040","258540"," And we can trade get underneath this and start taking it down at least to four twenty eight fifty"
"258540","258779"," one."
"258779","259399"," That would be nice. "
"260620","265540"," So far this has been this daily trigger has been the sounding board for bulls."
"267260","269920"," That is not broken here for some time."
"269920","275440"," So we also know that the velocity to the upside on the hourly trigger. "
"276260","278520"," Was very very thin at best."
"288440","289660"," Just a second here."
"290060","292060"," You got a few things I got to do here in the background. "
"294180","294980"," All right."
"295540","297180"," Today's stream SPX."
"299220","302780"," We're running a little bit behind here only because I've got some. "
"306820","310120"," Spy will do Tesla because we'll check on Tesla today."
"315960","316520"," Yes."
"316920","317800"," That's PX spy. "
"317960","319200"," We'll look at the cues today too."
"331200","335800"," Bank of England says the APF guilt so operation cover ratio one to 69."
"336300","340280"," So the Bank of England selling seven hundred and seventy million pounds of bonds in the auction"
"340280","342160"," receiving one spot three. "
"342160","345240"," What is going on with what are they doing like."
"349440","352340"," Like you YouTube just comes out with random shit."
"354760","355620"," One here. "
"357000","358240"," If I got this here."
"362890","363470"," All right."
"363490","364250"," There's a live stream. "
"364530","365130"," I think we're good."
"366250","369170"," We've also got discord up this morning in the background."
"370350","373170"," I'll be checking in with discord throughout the day. "
"379710","384030"," I just took some money off of spy puts here."
"384990","385450"," Okay."
"387950","389590"," Have a look at the market here. "
"390390","398420"," A small gap above still there."
"400420","403280"," See a nice pivot above right where my cursor is."
"403280","409060"," Another nice large gap down below that still has not been filled at this point. "
"413410","415350"," Small bear flag forming right here."
"415470","417610"," Not a flag but a bear plane right here."
"419450","421190"," You can see it right there. "
"422130","425330"," See if the sellers can stay in charge and close out this."
"425650","429790"," So in ten minutes time now we do expect to hear comments from Bank of England's man who speaks in"
"429790","432430"," a webinar hosted by the signal chairman."
"433250","437990"," Charles Myers an event for invited audience held under the charts and house rule. "
"438610","439470"," It's a good morning."
"439610","440450"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"441370","442210"," Happy morning."
"442410","442790"," Happy Monday. "
"449700","456030"," If you just saw any opinions on Tesla."
"457130","458910"," Do I have any opinions on Tesla?"
"459370","459790"," Let's have a look."
"463150","465610"," See my opinions on Tesla are this morning. "
"466390","471250"," I think I went over Tesla in discord last night."
"472230","473650"," You can go up here."
"474810","477950"," But my take here is that Tesla is going to consolidate. "
"478870","480510"," Basically the next two days."
"481750","484570"," Well first off if you want to stay long on Tesla today."
"485330","489050"," You're looking for Tesla to hold two forty four. "
"489750","492770"," As long as it holds two forty four you should go up."
"493930","496930"," The next two days today tomorrow."
"497450","501090"," I don't know when the rug gets pulled on discord last night. "
"501230","502810"," What I was telling people was that."
"504030","505670"," You've got a pain trade here."
"505870","506270"," You've got. "
"507050","509730"," You've got the so hedge funds are max short."
"509890","511970"," I want you to know that max max short like."
"512770","516730"," Short as they've ever been today because we open today. "
"516730","520570"," Hedge funds are like slamming the sell button."
"521850","525010"," We know that we have volatility coming into the market the rest of this week."
"526630","528290"," So everyone is hedged. "
"528610","531050"," People are going to load up on puts the next couple days."
"532070","532990"," Are they right?"
"533770","535210"," Yes they probably are."
"537050","538830"," When does it roll over though?"
"540390","543250"," Probably not until the last possible moment. "
"545010","548530"," Probably not until maybe the day after."
"549190","550170"," Even possibly."
"551010","553010"," The fed rate decision on Wednesday. "
"553930","556690"," I labeled today's video the pain trade."
"556690","560230"," It's likely what's going to happen here is everyone's max short."
"560490","561730"," Then the dealers are going to go against. "
"562930","567050"," All this bearishness and they're going to take the counter trade until there's a waterfall."
"567990","569870"," Of sentiment to the downside."
"570690","574170"," Till you get to get real money selling right in the marketplace. "
"574490","576990"," So for the for a bear or a seller."
"577490","580650"," It's kind of a hard trade for them on a Monday."
"582710","588690"," Of a very volatile week and it's likely going to continue to be difficult until. "
"589670","591130"," You see an actual role."
"591930","593550"," So if you're in sell side."
"594130","597070"," If you're in sell side you're going to need to see. "
"598950","601030"," Specific things to get bearish here."
"601330","602510"," Do I think a seller."
"603190","605950"," Will be right at some point this week or next week probably. "
"607950","613070"," But they can't as a retail sell side you probably can't put that trade on."
"613810","615730"," Until it shows itself to you."
"616450","620310"," So in a five minute one hour whatever that is you need to see. "
"620830","625670"," That bear playing form until you see that bear playing form you're going to get."
"625670","628750"," The pain trade that's what's going to happen you're going to take it."
"629210","631570"," It's going to be brutal it's not going to be fun so. "
"632490","634250"," As a retailer it's a hard trade."
"635710","639450"," To put on if I had any suggestions for you as a seller."
"640190","644970"," Maybe a putback spread I think that's the only trade you can actually take if you feel like hey my"
"644970","645790"," thesis is. "
"647090","649230"," We're going to roll here something like that."
"650290","651590"," Unless you see it."
"651590","653350"," The actual role. "
"654150","655330"," You have no trade."
"656970","661850"," There will be a lot of people in the background taking that bearish trade."
"662710","665830"," And the dealers are going to just work against you just work against you. "
"665970","666810"," They're not going to pay it."
"667750","670570"," And they'll pay it after but they're not going to pay it right now."
"670770","672790"," Not one more that well hedged right now. "
"677150","682170"," So if you're so I guess if you were if you're bearish you're in a holding pattern."
"683350","687210"," If you're bullish if you're bullish on this whole week."
"690070","692770"," I would say yeah you're going up but at the same time. "
"693330","697530"," All this going up means nothing to me at least to me I see it as."
"699730","702290"," The rug pull is right there waiting for you."
"703890","708090"," So it's a dangerous trade right if you're if you're a bull there's a dangerous trade here. "
"709450","712850"," If they rug pull you you're going to come back and say something like."
"713810","714610"," What happened."
"716010","717130"," Why is this happening. "
"719090","722530"," When as a bull you want to be buying dips right that that's the key here."
"722570","724310"," So you're buying a dip as a bull."
"725570","727550"," There's a lot of safety in that dip buying. "
"728010","730170"," When you're in a when you're at a bottom you're buying a dip as a bull."
"730370","733210"," You can usually buy it with some confidence and know that it's going to hold."
"733670","738670"," It's going to go up and you're in some kind of safety where we are right now. "
"738730","740210"," There isn't much safety for you."
"740630","745430"," So it's a very difficult trade to put on this week in my view or at least for me."
"745690","747070"," It's a hard trade to put on. "
"748910","753130"," It doesn't it's not it's the kind of week where I don't like to trade it's kind of week where."
"754530","756890"," If I had my choice I would just wait for."
"757970","759190"," That topping action. "
"759890","762630"," Take a believe it or not to be on sell side."
"764110","765610"," Not on buy side here."
"773100","779260"," So that's my take I think I posted that last night that this is not the time for most people"
"779260","779720"," to be trading. "
"782520","785060"," If you can't if you can't trade fast."
"787300","789460"," You're likely going to get caught at some point."
"796380","800080"," HYG rolling over this morning trying to close some gaps down below. "
"800780","806380"," Just in the background I'm watching HYG heading on down they left a big giant gap on high."
"807520","809220"," But the gap down below is much larger."
"810320","811800"," Dixie cranking right now. "
"813380","816620"," NDX holding itself up but it does have a gap down below."
"817380","822380"," There's a gap on NDX between 14 5 86 and 14 5 31."
"823940","826560"," Vix catching some some legs this morning. "
"827300","833120"," Tesla with a bounce right there just Tesla just came off a bounce at 245 97."
"833660","840780"," They left a gap behind below between 240 245 246 03 and 243 98."
"842200","844420"," IWM busted out this morning. "
"847160","849160"," Nice and strong on IWM."
"860530","862190"," Yeah IWM is rubbing some heads off."
"862370","863450"," This is a hard trade man. "
"863690","865810"," This is not it's not an easy trade."
"866130","873410"," I'm going to suspect here that I'm going to suspect here that bulls are you know I'm suspect is"
"873410","875470"," that dealers are going to be on both sides right now."
"876730","880790"," And we're going to go up and it's going to be that pain trade. "
"880870","882130"," It's a pain trade all the way up."
"883390","887810"," My other suspicion here would be as we go up in that pain trade commit or continues."
"889170","892610"," You're going to see bulls say that it's it's going to it's going to hold. "
"893350","896170"," So you start drinking the Kool-Aid and then it rolls."
"898390","901820"," I read on Andrea congratulations."
"903400","911100"," Nice right on Andrea. "
"912600","917380"," I do want to make a programming note as well if you're just joining us right now."
"918000","924480"," That we're making some administration changes inside of the discord."
"925140","931140"," I went in and I found people that were supposedly not banned that were banned. "
"931140","940140"," I found people that were shadow band behind the scenes so you were unbanned but then there was a"
"940140","941960"," shadow band on users."
"942840","946320"," So there's a blanket amnesty inside of the discord."
"947240","953000"," So if you are a discord user there was something else that I saw I noticed in the discord that"
"953000","958780"," bother was a few things that I noticed within the discord they were an issue for me. "
"959520","965320"," You know discord's are important for three reasons."
"966460","968860"," This is on the this is on the Reddit thing too."
"969240","971300"," It's like ties back into the Reddit thing. "
"972800","980020"," I'm a long time social media user since kind of since the beginning like Yahoo message board days."
"985840","988920"," I was like six months old when I got on Reddit."
"989600","992340"," Silk Road user you name it right way back in the day. "
"992900","998600"," And I was looking at our discord and I noticed the three big things like first thing is our"
"998600","1002440"," discord's layout was for a long time user."
"1003780","1005420"," It wasn't easy to use."
"1005740","1006500"," You don't know where to go. "
"1006620","1007280"," You don't know what to do."
"1009020","1010280"," It's overly complicated."
"1012220","1016020"," The second issue that I had with discord or my this is my discord right. "
"1016820","1018120"," Second it so ease of use."
"1019460","1020660"," And then usefulness."
"1022200","1025520"," There's a lot of useful stuff in there but again couldn't find it. "
"1025720","1028579"," I was like where's all this useful stuff that we have and it's great."
"1028800","1030140"," It's great stuff that we have in there."
"1030140","1034960"," And then the last thing that I noticed was enjoy an enjoyment factor like a people enjoying"
"1034960","1036000"," themselves out of there. "
"1036260","1038560"," You know useful easy and enjoyable."
"1039160","1042880"," Three huge things and I didn't see that."
"1042980","1052280"," I noticed that new users were being yelled at by an admin"
"1052280","1055140"," and that should not be happening right. "
"1057480","1061200"," New members should have a great experience."
"1061920","1063720"," And when they become members."
"1064740","1068660"," So if you're a new member right you should have a great experience and you should carry that into"
"1068660","1070020"," being a regular member. "
"1070460","1076220"," It's empowering for a member to have an enjoyable easy and useful experience."
"1077180","1078860"," They create the culture of a discord."
"1079580","1080880"," Discord's kind of that place right. "
"1081580","1085880"," The community is actually the discord not the moderators not the administrators."
"1086920","1091780"," Ministrators jobs are to facilitate ease of use."
"1093040","1094400"," Facilitate enjoyability. "
"1095220","1096240"," Facilitate usefulness."
"1097420","1100560"," Moderators are there to help the community grow right."
"1100740","1104420"," They're the active participants trying to guide and help members along. "
"1105580","1107040"," I didn't see that inside our discord."
"1107040","1109720"," So we're making some changes."
"1111200","1113360"," All of our mods are on board with this. "
"1113740","1118780"," The administrators are on board with this and we've added some new administrators to help us along."
"1119180","1123780"," So if you've been to the discord in the past."
"1125000","1128740"," Please check it out once more even if it's for five minutes just get in there. "
"1129640","1131180"," See the changes that are being made."
"1132260","1136340"," It has to become those things for us for us to continue to grow and keep people happy."
"1137220","1138380"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1138380","1141580"," I don't want to go somewhere and work and use something that's broken."
"1142760","1148180"," This past week some of the talk about Reddit is in line with this stuff right."
"1148880","1153860"," And then people were looking for an alternative to leave Reddit for and everywhere they looked. "
"1154520","1156520"," It wasn't any of those three things."
"1156820","1161920"," People were looking at Mastodon and they were looking at a bunch of different decentralized social"
"1161920","1162740"," media platforms."
"1163260","1166200"," A ton of those are not easy to use. "
"1166540","1170240"," No ease of use can't just sign up and find a new home."
"1170520","1178740"," So a mass migration for sites like Reddit."
"1179320","1183480"," There's not that many places to migrate to for ease of use. "
"1185200","1188340"," And that's that partially has to do when I'm looking at our discord."
"1188520","1191100"," I'm like, how do people come here and have ease of use?"
"1191100","1192320"," I'm like, it's just another."
"1192580","1195360"," It's another, you know, it just doesn't work. "
"1195600","1201000"," So we're working on that in the background for you guys to ensure that you have a place you can"
"1201000","1201180"," go."
"1201300","1201960"," Enjoy yourselves."
"1202460","1204000"," Find that useful information. "
"1204860","1208760"," Not walk around, you know, afraid that someone's going to yell at you or whatever."
"1232860","1234440"," Yeah, the fear of the wrath, man."
"1234600","1235760"," There'll be no more wrath in there. "
"1235900","1236820"," That shit is over."
"1237040","1237760"," I'll be honest with you."
"1238280","1238700"," Point blank. "
"1239240","1241360"," I went through a bunch of the logs in there."
"1241360","1245760"," And I was I was embarrassed."
"1246160","1247180"," I'll be honest. "
"1248400","1249580"," I was embarrassed."
"1250700","1252700"," It was it was shocking."
"1253100","1255100"," You can't have a new member. "
"1255880","1258880"," You can't have a new member of your discord."
"1259840","1263960"," Have an administrator come down on them when they when they're brand new."
"1264560","1266280"," What that does is it creates. "
"1267300","1271300"," But does is as a new member, it tells you that you have you have no empowerment."
"1271760","1275280"," And then once you become a member, you know that you don't have any empowerment."
"1275340","1278940"," And then when you move up to a moderator, you don't have empowerment. "
"1279340","1282420"," It's really a micromanaging is brutal."
"1282860","1284060"," It's never a good thing."
"1284260","1286320"," So we can't have it. "
"1294300","1295860"," Yeah, they're not as harsh anymore."
"1296080","1298160"," As a matter of fact, that all."
"1299560","1302140"," The moderators that are in there right now are outstanding. "
"1302980","1304640"," The moderators are in there right now are outstanding."
"1304960","1305700"," The admins are outstanding."
"1306360","1307360"," I've met with all of them. "
"1308040","1309460"," They all feel felt the same way."
"1309620","1311620"," I mean, can't have that going on."
"1311780","1315440"," You know, can't have the tyrannical rule inside of a inside of a discord. "
"1315580","1316960"," It's just not that's not the place."
"1317880","1319260"," You guys already know, right?"
"1319400","1321720"," When you're in Twitter, Twitter is like a dumpster fire, right?"
"1323140","1324500"," Reddit is what?"
"1324500","1330660"," It's been Astro Turf that's been, you know, you can't have any more conversations like you want to"
"1330660","1331260"," have on Reddit."
"1332020","1335340"," You can't have any conversations anymore in my view on Twitter. "
"1336140","1337700"," So where else do you have to go?"
"1337860","1338880"," It's like there's not many choices."
"1340720","1344200"," So I personally wake up like a place to retreat to."
"1344980","1349460"," I saw a blind nest owl had a really good post the other day on discord where he was just"
"1349460","1353860"," he was sitting next to a bar and asking the bartender for a bear and just relaxing. "
"1353860","1357860"," And I was like, to me, that's what a discord is, a place I can retreat to."
"1358740","1361440"," If there's a there's a it should be easy, right?"
"1361560","1365440"," A channel that's like maybe the daily discussion thread on Wall Street Bets."
"1365620","1368400"," And then another channel that's a serious trading channel. "
"1368840","1372700"," I should automatically know, hey, when I go into this one channel, I can shit post."
"1372940","1375720"," And when I go into this other channel, this is where we're being serious."
"1375720","1377880"," This is serious trading time, right?"
"1378440","1378940"," Oh, yeah. "
"1379260","1380240"," Look at that roll, baby."
"1384860","1387660"," So, you know, like it should be simple."
"1388620","1391320"," This is where I can I can post my P and L's. "
"1391420","1392180"," I can shit post."
"1392480","1394800"," I can do all this fun shit, right?"
"1395800","1397380"," And I can be with the community."
"1397800","1402400"," And then when I want to go trade futures or something, I can go into that room and we're all"
"1402400","1403000"," game phases. "
"1408560","1409420"," Yeah, absolutely."
"1410320","1412620"," Yeah, that will not that is a no go anymore."
"1413620","1416860"," If you ever see that, let me know again. "
"1417020","1421740"," I didn't know how I didn't know how I had no idea how rough it was in there."
"1421940","1423140"," I started going through."
"1423300","1425940"," I was like, what the fuck is this?"
"1431480","1433160"," And so this doggy down. "
"1438120","1442040"," Oh, there's a YouTuber that you mentioned all the time was my team is that way every time I tune"
"1442040","1442220"," in."
"1442220","1443020"," It's painful to watch."
"1443460","1444800"," Yeah, I can't do it. "
"1444900","1445600"," I can't."
"1446040","1450300"," So I was talking to my buddy last night, I was talking to my friend Joe Donut last night."
"1450820","1454520"," And he made a point to me that I'm going to read it to you what he said to me"
"1454520","1455020"," last night. "
"1456640","1459680"," And this is a this is a point I want to say to you guys out there."
"1459740","1460860"," It's an important thing to remember."
"1461100","1461220"," Okay. "
"1464640","1465860"," What did he say to me?"
"1465980","1469640"," He said, he said, remember, this is supposed to be fun."
"1469640","1472180"," And I'm like, that's right."
"1472440","1473460"," I'm like, he's fucking right. "
"1473740","1474920"," Like, this is supposed to be fun."
"1475120","1478060"," This isn't our trading is hard enough, right?"
"1478600","1480400"," Training is a hard, hard thing to do."
"1480980","1482220"," It's not easy to trade. "
"1483000","1484840"," There's a lot of pain in trading."
"1485640","1486800"," You make a bad call."
"1487080","1487840"," You make a bad trade. "
"1488260","1489680"," You make a bad whatever it is."
"1490140","1490820"," And you're already stressed."
"1491180","1491700"," You're in a position. "
"1491940","1492340"," You're already stressed."
"1494140","1496520"," Discord should not be that for people."
"1496660","1497520"," It should be an easy thing. "
"1504280","1505000"," Let's see what you got there."
"1508400","1509260"," That's a good morning."
"1509580","1511000"," Good afternoon to you out there. "
"1513880","1515780"," So Larry Williams, first shortest today."

"1534970","1536390"," Welcome back from vacation, brother."

"1539130","1540110"," We got Winky coming back."
"1540110","1541930"," We got Joey Donut coming back from vacation."
"1542950","1545390"," Everybody's been, everybody's been around the world. "
"1551060","1553740"," No, you know, it really wasn't a, it wasn't a broader issue."
"1556700","1561540"," It's stemmed from one specific person."
"1561900","1563860"," And that's just, that's just not going to happen anymore. "
"1564240","1566840"," So, you know what I'm saying?"
"1566940","1568000"," It's usually top down."
"1568180","1573700"," You can usually, usually you can go, when this is going on, you can usually walk your way through"
"1573700","1574980"," and find who it is."
"1576660","1577580"," And that's it. "
"1577680","1578180"," You find it."
"1578400","1578900"," That's it."
"1578920","1579280"," It's done. "
"1581220","1586860"," You find out every person underneath that person was walking on eggshells at all, at all times."
"1598610","1599470"," Oh, thanks, Terry."
"1599670","1600890"," Doug, hope you had a great weekend as well. "
"1609640","1611340"," Yeah, the sellers came out quick."
"1611600","1612320"," Yeah, this is it."
"1612440","1616520"," This is going to be a challenge for, this is going to be a challenge for traders. "
"1616520","1618360"," I'm going to be, I'm going to be serious with it."
"1618440","1620660"," If you're a bull out there, you're going to be claiming a bunch of crap."
"1621480","1623220"," Whenever this roll comes down here. "
"1626180","1628400"," If we can get underneath this hourly though."
"1629440","1631220"," Look out below, baby."
"1632720","1633880"," Look out below. "
"1635880","1645580"," Yeah, low volume range bound day for spy so far."
"1645820","1648620"," Yeah, I'm trying to get, trying to sell this here personally."
"1649800","1651980"," Next, next two days, three days. "
"1652180","1653220"," I want to sell this if I can."
"1653400","1656460"," The prices may have been in core goods and food prices."
"1665930","1668710"," I'm back on some four twenty eights. "
"1669130","1669910"," They keep bouncing around."
"1670050","1671770"," I keep taking the money off just to heads up."
"1672810","1678210"," So I keep buying and selling four twenty eight P's bottom now three times. "
"1679090","1682770"," Keep shaving them for like five cents, three cents somewhere in there."
"1685310","1686390"," Four twenty eight P's."
"1686430","1691190"," We've got a hundred and twelve thousand puts on four thirty P right now. "
"1692890","1695330"," So seller is going to, they're going to re-venge trade this."
"1695330","1696110"," I guarantee it."
"1696370","1698030"," Next two days, three days. "
"1698710","1700950"," Hammer the sell button, hammer the sell button."
"1701010","1702990"," Get a free trial."
"1703290","1703890"," Take show. "
"1704530","1707510"," What they're other waiting for is some other waiting force."
"1707890","1709030"," Someone just said low volume."
"1709510","1712070"," All they're waiting for is the market to sell, right?"
"1712070","1713690"," They're looking for some volume in the market. "
"1713970","1717450"," And then that's the real money selling will overtake the dealer hedging."
"1723660","1726460"," Yes, he is no longer there any longer, Justin."
"1727400","1728680"," Not happening anymore. "
"1729460","1730460"," It can't do it."
"1731060","1731880"," It can't."
"1741720","1747420"," Did anybody see, did anybody, does anybody out there notice that think or swim this morning book"
"1747420","1748160"," maps not working?"
"1748540","1749680"," Or is that just me?"
"1750300","1752500"," Anybody having any issues with a book map this morning?"
"1753660","1754860"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"1755000","1755480"," Come on down."
"1755740","1757040"," Print Daddy some more money."
"1757580","1758820"," Free money Mondays. "
"1763040","1764000"," It's working."
"1764240","1764860"," It's not working."
"1766640","1769000"," Yeah, that's what I'm having issues with the new contract. "
"1769940","1770900"," I was getting hung up."
"1771920","1774200"," Okay, so I'm not the only one running into that this morning."
"1777360","1778560"," Print Daddy some money. "
"1778740","1779840"," Get underneath that daily."
"1780120","1781080"," Are they hourly trigger?"
"1781620","1784600"," I mean, I'll tell you what."
"1784840","1785560"," This is a beautiful. "
"1785980","1787540"," Tell you guys something here, okay?"
"1788740","1790600"," Let me tease you with a good time."
"1792240","1795740"," I want you to know something."
"1795920","1797160"," If we can get price. "
"1799880","1802660"," If we can get price underneath this hourly trigger."
"1806440","1810810"," I mean, the one issue here is this gap."
"1812310","1813870"," They rip this back up. "
"1814190","1818650"," But if you can get underneath at any point this hourly trigger."
"1822290","1825910"," That's going to be a that's going to be a beautiful like down right there."
"1826090","1829170"," So I don't know if we're going to get down there. "
"1829250","1834950"," But if we do like this bad boy right here, that's the one that the bears are looking for."
"1835110","1838330"," Bears need to get underneath right here."
"1840810","1841790"," If they can. "
"1843610","1846970"," Game on game on for the bears."
"1849010","1851710"," Bank of England's man services inflation at brief."
"1851930","1853470"," It's a problem for the UK. "
"1854610","1856050"," So you got to wait for this."
"1857250","1860330"," If this doesn't happen, you ain't got no trade."
"1861470","1862750"," Bears need to get underneath. "
"1864650","1865510"," Right here."
"1865770","1866030"," Boom."
"1866310","1866770"," There you go. "
"1866910","1868750"," There's your money shot right there."
"1881720","1882660"," Do I trade oil?"
"1882900","1883320"," I used to."
"1885700","1886520"," I use trade. "
"1886740","1888440"," I don't trade right now, but I do watch it."
"1888740","1890120"," So in the background, I'll keep it on."
"1890340","1891780"," Matter of fact, I'll keep it on right now. "
"1891900","1895600"," Look at IWM's just rip ripping faces off right now."
"1898420","1901480"," Trade 186.81 on IWM."
"1903880","1904680"," Tesla consolidating. "
"1905640","1908060"," If you want, I can check on oil for you right now."
"1908140","1908420"," Hold on."
"1908680","1909120"," I'll look at it. "
"1921300","1922920"," So CL, right?"
"1926810","1928510"," It's getting close to a dip."
"1929950","1931710"," It's almost there."
"1933950","1937750"," It should start to the bottoming process. "
"1938450","1942790"," It's going to take some time for it to consolidate for a move higher."
"1943130","1949090"," I can see that maybe you're asking about that previous low back on the 31st of May."
"1949690","1952610"," It's not quite at bottom right now, but it's getting close. "
"1953330","1954510"," It's almost there."
"1954830","1959410"," Not quite there, but very, very close to its bottom."
"1960290","1962590"," So I'll keep an eye on CL for you. "
"1963070","1968090"," You want to see CL start to trade sideways a little bit."
"1968750","1971770"," If you do check back with me, it's close to a buy."
"1979210","1980950"," Yeah, I'm in some puts right now. "
"1980950","1983090"," I'm in 428Ps."
"1993800","1994640"," Oil is close."
"1995000","1995800"," It's getting there. "
"1996460","1997560"," Thanks for asking about it."
"1999340","2000920"," It's starting to be bought."
"2001160","2001980"," It's almost there. "
"2002500","2002840"," Almost."
"2003740","2004480"," If I had to guess."
"2008430","2010030"," It's within a couple bucks, right?"
"2021160","2021840"," It's close. "
"2029900","2033540"," Man, dude, I'll tell you what, the oil does look still looks bearish."
"2037160","2039300"," It's still overall looks bearish."
"2041020","2046740"," You'll get a dip buy here, but you've got some major trend coming down over you on oil. "
"2048219","2049300"," It looks ugly."
"2050780","2053340"," Are we going to see how it'll go negative again or no?"
"2057159","2059840"," Yeah, it looks overall bearish."
"2067510","2068949"," It doesn't look bullish. "
"2069290","2071510"," I'm going to show you that even with a dip buy down here."
"2071510","2074250"," The government says there's a reasonable chance the rates could go higher."
"2075350","2078690"," Like today, it could go to like 65.50 something like that. "
"2081190","2083370"," But it's overall bearish."
"2085230","2087530"," It's got a lot of work ahead of itself, doesn't it?"
"2106160","2108560"," See if the sellers can stay in charge here."
"2109120","2109860"," You can see them. "
"2109940","2111680"," Notice how we're not trending on the spy."
"2112340","2116100"," Notice how sellers just keep coming in, selling down, selling down."
"2116900","2120380"," Let's take a look at, let's open up our view here a little bit. "
"2122260","2124300"," Just the use so you can see here."
"2124860","2127040"," This is trend that we're on right now."
"2127620","2132680"," You can see the sellers stepping in on Friday, stepping in again in pre-market. "
"2133520","2136100"," And they're attempting one more time and one more time."
"2136860","2140800"," They only have so much time to get underneath this trend and try to send this lower."
"2141600","2144880"," If they fail down in here at any point, you know what that means. "
"2144880","2146520"," We're going to start squeezing higher here."
"2150630","2154570"," Bank of England's man says inflation expectations have moderated since May."
"2157720","2160840"," You can see, I do want you to pay attention if you're a bull. "
"2161220","2162560"," I want you to pay attention down here."
"2162880","2166140"," You can see velocity is weakening for the bulls."
"2166440","2167560"," 100 signaling neutral. "
"2188150","2189850"," Who's what's going on?"
"2201490","2202990"," What's going on?"
"2203110","2208380"," Oh, you asked about, you're asking about it."
"2208460","2208800"," Hold on a second."
"2209020","2210340"," Who's asking about the JPM caller?"
"2211220","2213400"," What's the question on the JPM caller?"
"2219700","2221560"," Someone said I suck at texting back. "
"2223680","2225560"," Who's asking me about texting back?"
"2230540","2234600"," They asked you about the JPM caller."

"3432310","3433190"," Let's take a look and see. "
"3437300","3440000"," See how long the bears have been waiting for the hourly to break."
"3440340","3440840"," Oh boy."
"3440860","3442100"," It's been some time, hasn't it?"
"3446420","3448480"," It's been, they haven't broken the hourly. "
"3448740","3452560"," Well, they've broken it a few times, but not with effect."
"3455920","3457180"," Definitely not with effect."
"3464740","3465180"," Yeah. "
"3465520","3467120"," They've gotten underneath it."
"3467120","3477110"," But where they got some effect, maybe, like some real"
"3477110","3482430"," good print to the downside was May 23rd."
"3484930","3487670"," It's like 20 days ago, something like that. "
"3490430","3491830"," It's been 84 years."

"3616200","3616820"," No, Joe."
"3617000","3618080"," I don't know if I'm having issues. "
"3619320","3624040"," If it's like a local thing and like regional or something like that inside the area where I live."
"3655920","3656920"," Yeah, let me know in the chat."
"3657040","3659040"," Are you guys long, short here?"
"3659160","3659520"," What are you doing?"
"3659660","3661440"," Are you guys accumulating calls for the next couple of days?"
"3667930","3669710"," The bear's hibernating during the summer, LOL. "
"3670110","3670210"," Yeah."
"3672050","3678130"," I think if there's any chance for a vol that's probably after Wednesday."
"3682150","3685510"," I'd like to see the market roll like Monday. "
"3686170","3689830"," If I had a chance, if I had a choice, it would be Monday."
"3690850","3694930"," I don't like the market hedging right now is massive."
"3695810","3701810"," And then you know that everyone's buying puts right now for the expected volatility this week. "
"3703310","3705070"," It's like when do they actually pay it?"
"3706570","3709070"," Usually after, not before."
"3716040","3718860"," Core book is long, but options are flat bullet of cash."
"3720540","3721520"," I'm hoping for a seller. "
"3721840","3723120"," Yeah, I don't know if we're going to get it."
"3723840","3725000"," They're trying right now."
"3725140","3726780"," You can see we're not in trend day to the upside. "
"3727620","3729140"," They're going to test this down here."
"3729260","3730400"," Close this gap down below."
"3731800","3736800"," If they can't, if they give the sell side can't get this wind down here and get underneath this"
"3736800","3737380"," hourly trigger. "
"3738500","3740360"," You know we're going to start moving here."
"3741120","3742420"," We'll have to switch to the buy side."
"3751960","3753420"," What call spreads on Tesla?"
"3755120","3757760"," I'm not a fan of buying Tesla right now. "
"3758720","3766740"," I'm not a fan of buying Tesla until you might catch a bounce in late June and then July is"
"3766740","3767740"," the real run for Tesla."
"3768920","3769640"," You know it's weird too."
"3769760","3770760"," I was on Discord last night. "
"3770780","3776880"," I was talking to people about the first few weeks of a bull market."
"3777660","3782880"," Returns are not that good, but from that point forward they get great."
"3785040","3793900"," So my view here would be let the bull market digest for the next few weeks and then enter a"
"3793900","3794720"," long position. "
"3795860","3802860"," So if you're trying to put a call spread on let's say for Tesla, my own thoughts are that you"
"3802860","3805000"," just kick back for the next few weeks."
"3808300","3809580"," And find a place to buy."
"3809900","3811920"," I'd like to enter the next trade for Tesla too. "
"3813620","3816220"," So I'm going to let it play out next two, three weeks."
"3816440","3816880"," Just sit back."
"3817080","3817400"," We're relaxed. "
"3817620","3817880"," Let it out."
"3818040","3818780"," Let everything digest."
"3830400","3830800"," Yeah. "
"3831020","3832800"," Twitch doesn't give you the choice."
"3833060","3833320"," Does it?"
"3835860","3836840"," I think they mandate."
"3837240","3838800"," I think they like force it or something. "
"3842220","3843940"," I'm going to look at TGT for you."
"3860800","3862040"," Still selling, huh?"
"3866610","3868450"," You caught no bounce down there."
"3868730","3869550"," No bounce at 137. "
"3869750","3870590"," No joy."
"3871630","3872710"," PEP selling down."
"3872950","3874870"," It's at the bottom of its bearishness right now. "
"3875290","3875570"," It's close."
"3875850","3876250"," It's daily."
"3876630","3877470"," It's daily. "
"3878870","3880010"," Velocity is starting the bottom."
"3880810","3883730"," Let me look at it."
"3883870","3887270"," The issue here with TGT is the same issue with oil. "
"3894160","3897660"," It's getting to a buy point, but it's overall bearish."
"3900320","3901400"," Take a look in the background."
"3921300","3922700"," And I'll tell you what, man. "
"3924300","3926720"," I'm still bearish here on TGT."
"3939110","3943090"," It's got a massive bear plane on it on the weekly."
"3946110","3949690"," Massive bear plane back here on the daily on it. "
"3950690","3952850"," Is it viable yet?"
"3953250","3953770"," Probably not."
"3961500","3963540"," It's getting close to Bible."
"3965660","3968840"," And then the other thing about it too is it's going to fight. "
"3974180","3976680"," It's going to take some time for it to consolidate."
"3979240","3981320"," And it can go lower from here as well."
"4004320","4007400"," It's almost at max bearishness, but not quite. "
"4008540","4013780"," UN Chief Guterres says I'm concerned a rush will quit the Black Sea Green Deal next month."
"4017560","4020560"," Almost there in TGT, or TGT, not quite though."
"4020560","4022980"," I wouldn't catch that knife yet. "
"4024080","4031900"," And even if you do catch that knife, it's likely going to trade sideways for a period of time."
"4033480","4035000"," How long do you want to hold it for?"
"4041960","4043660"," Who's asking about TGT hope?"
"4045400","4046540"," Is it way oversold?"
"4046760","4055620"," Yeah, it is, but when it's in, when it's in distribution like it is right now on a weekly chart,"
"4055920","4060120"," right, you can see a massive bear plane on it."
"4061860","4066260"," So, and you've got trapped buyers in there right where it is. "
"4066980","4068700"," So you know what that means, right?"
"4069020","4070740"," They just want out at this point."
"4071720","4074100"," So even if you catch the bounce down here on target."
"4076800","4080780"," Even if you catch the bounce down there, it's going to be, you're going to be sold into. "

"4096390","4097229"," Every single one of them. "
"4097910","4099229"," And they're going to catch a pain trade."
"4101850","4104550"," 136.51, definitely."
"4105930","4112689"," And I would assume that those people are going to be the loudest saying it's oversold. "

"4304020","4305180"," They got trapped. "
"4306360","4310960"," And the daily velocity is still aggressively to the downside, right?"
"4311220","4312140"," That's not good to see."
"4313800","4315940"," I don't like seeing stuff like this here."
"4316060","4318440"," Showing you the velocity is to the downside. "
"4318680","4321440"," More monetary policy tightening is likely."

"6278320","6280400"," One of the chances it could be a fake out. "
"6280500","6281300"," Have you seen it go blush?"
"6281460","6283020"," Well, there's no real trade here."
"6284180","6287840"," The trade still right now is on the bear side here."
"6288960","6291100"," What are you looking for here?"
"6291100","6293520"," It's like an up or down trade if you're looking for it. "

"6299680","6302700"," You are actually first looking for this to move up."
"6303680","6304820"," Come back down. "
"6305620","6307640"," Get that continuation trade higher."
"6308880","6310380"," It's what you're looking for to be bullish."
"6310940","6312840"," Truthfully, you're looking for this part of the trade. "
"6313380","6317240"," You're now looking for this part of the trade right here."
"6317300","6319260"," It's pretty dangerous taking this long right here."
"6320680","6322120"," So you are looking for that. "
"6322340","6323580"," You know, the rejection."
"6323840","6326080"," We're not rejection, but clear out this bullshit up here."
"6326760","6329740"," Come back down and take that trade higher for the bears. "
"6330880","6331920"," They've had all morning."
"6332200","6333320"," So we were not in trend day."
"6333380","6334060"," We know that, right?"
"6334200","6335440"," We didn't start trending right off the open. "
"6335780","6336540"," So that's already unknown."
"6337440","6340460"," And then the bears have had all morning to sell this down, right?"
"6340600","6342620"," Or south side has had all morning to sell this down."
"6342900","6343300"," Sell it down. "
"6343480","6343980"," Sell it down."
"6344540","6345760"," It's now 11.30 in the morning."
"6345900","6347500"," It's two hours since cash market opened. "
"6348500","6352060"," The longer we spend sitting here, the more bullish we actually become."
"6353280","6355080"," And so you're going to, you know, you give them the hour, right?"
"6355200","6356100"," You give them nine till nine."
"6356220","6356340"," Thirty. "
"6356540","6360340"," You give them till 11.30. This is kind of it for the bears down here at 11.29. They"
"6360340","6363160"," got a minute to sell this basically."
"6363480","6366160"," Another like one to five minutes for them to sell this down."
"6366660","6367280"," Can they do it?"
"6367500","6367600"," Sure. "
"6368760","6372740"," But if you sit here long enough, like we sit here for like two hours, three hours."
"6373660","6374960"," We're going to squeeze, right?"
"6375640","6379840"," You need to get some sell side needs to get some traction here."
"6380640","6384760"," The longer we sit here, the longer the chances are that we start squeezing. "
"6385080","6386140"," At the top of the hour."
"6386460","6387200"," At the bottom of the hour."
"6390720","6391960"," Now, is it bullish though?"
"6392320","6393400"," I don't consider it bullish. "
"6395060","6401680"," My thoughts here for the next two days into Wednesday is like there's max hedging going on."
"6401820","6404200"," There's max put buying going on."
"6405080","6409520"," Sellers are out in a bow right now and they're going to re-vend straight this all the way into"
"6409520","6409920"," tomorrow. "
"6410060","6410920"," All the way into Wednesday."
"6412520","6414100"," Do I think sellers win?"
"6414580","6417040"," Ultimately yes, but I think it takes time."
"6418240","6418880"," So here we go. "
"6418980","6419320"," We're squeezing."
"6421720","6423840"," 11.30. There's your squeeze."
"6424240","6427600"," You yield four spot two percent before the forty billion dollar auction. "
"6432420","6435080"," Can't sit around spending all this time down here."
"6435080","6438900"," Dicking around and not getting any kind of improvement to the downside."
"6439000","6441500"," So, trying to squeeze them right now. "
"6451600","6453100"," No dice for the sellers."
"6460850","6462130"," We've got a pre-market."
"6462810","6469070"," We've got a couple pre-market vol or not vol so much as we've got some pivots here. "

"6478570","6480590"," Gap where the sellers are above."
"6481330","6483350"," They're hiding out right here in pre-market."
"6483550","6486150"," They're hiding out at 4.31. Sixty sevenish. "
"6502370","6504370"," Go back up there and make sure they're serious."
"6510910","6511710"," Trading four."
"6512790","6513250"," 30. "

"6589260","6591720"," Actually a DC eight and that's the last one."
"6591720","6594020"," And then I got stopped out."
"6594600","6596440"," And then I took the long side trade here. "
"6596640","6601400"," After the forty billion dollar auction last up spot six basis points."
"6601480","6603100"," See if you can get another green bar here."
"6603600","6604940"," Some confirmation of the upside. "
"6623520","6625580"," Bulls have an hour ahead for themselves."
"6626740","6628160"," See if the bulls can do it."
"6628300","6629020"," They got one hour. "
"6632020","6634940"," I'm on four thirty two C's right now."

"8773980","8775620"," My kids do that stuff."
"8777000","8779700"," My wife and my kids, my wife is awesome. "
"8781440","8785440"," I'm the kind of guy that's not traditional."
"8785640","8792600"," I'm not traditional, but I'm like, I'll give a good example."
"8793260","8796020"," When I was a kid, I loved Cheez-Its. "
"8797440","8798860"," You're not supposed to eat Cheez-Its."
"8799020","8799700"," They're bad for you."
"8800000","8801120"," They're not a good cracker at all. "
"8802900","8808360"," But with my kids, I was like when daddy was young, my mommy used to get me Cheez-Its and"
"8808360","8812440"," Cheez-Its in a can and make a little Cheez-Its sandwich."
"8813820","8815380"," So I'll get that for my kids."
"8816800","8818780"," And the kids are like, that's awesome, daddy. "
"8820120","8820940"," I love it."
"8822340","8825440"," But then they're with my wife."
"8826060","8829200"," My wife is like, oh, you like those Cheez-Its?"
"8830540","8832820"," She's like, we should get the extra crispy burnt ones. "
"8834120","8836100"," So the kids are like, oh yeah, we'll try that money."
"8836100","8837560"," That's broadened our horizons."
"8838880","8842260"," So they get these nasty burnt Cheez-Its. "
"8842920","8843500"," They don't eat them."
"8845980","8848180"," So then my wife will be like, oh, you didn't like those?"
"8848400","8849520"," Let's try some other Cheez-Its."
"8849820","8852420"," They've got this other flavor there, so my kids will get the Cheez-Its. "
"8853680","8856360"," And so now they've got like four boxes of shit they don't eat."
"8860080","8862420"," So I'm like, oh, you guys got all these Cheez-Its."
"8863000","8864440"," You must think you like them, right?"
"8864560","8865080"," You're going to eat them?"
"8865820","8866860"," You're like, no, daddy. "
"8866980","8868480"," We're going to eat the Cheez-Its that you get."
"8869120","8870560"," And just let those sit there."
"8872660","8874220"," Right now we're on Korean food. "
"8874520","8877500"," So our cupboards are littered with Korean foods."
"8878060","8878780"," Some of them they like."
"8879600","8881340"," And a whole bunch of them are just sitting there. "
"8885940","8886660"," One and done."
"8895540","8899740"," Easy Cheez-Its on townhouse crackers was a delicacy when I was growing up."
"8900000","8901820"," Yeah, we're not getting much moving here, are we?"
"8903700","8905140"," No premium either. "
"8905820","8908180"," Options complex looks like dog shit right now."
"8914240","8915620"," Yeah, not climbing at all."
"8915880","8919600"," It's like bouncing, 20 cents, 21 cents, 22 cents. "
"8920760","8922120"," A lot of risk here too."
"8922800","8924340"," A lot of danger right here on the upside."
"8928380","8929560"," Tesla rolling over. "
"8930380","8931920"," Yeah, they're going to try to sell it on them."

"9206020","9206900"," They got to do this."
"9206900","9209380"," If they don't do it, we're going to roll right back down here."

"9256310","9258950"," They only have like three days to cover or something like that. "
"9259810","9262010"," So they just blasted it down on their ER."

"9384910","9386870"," I was wondering about that too, right?"
"9387090","9392630"," I was going to say something to Peru and I didn't."
"9392790","9393790"," I just, I was like, I'll be quiet."

"9416670","9417610"," I didn't call anybody out."
"9417690","9418970"," I just like, yeah, I'll just be quiet."
"9440240","9441520"," 10 minutes left for the bulls. "

"9573400","9575660"," See if the bulls can hold on for another hour."
"9577660","9578340"," I'm not."
"9578560","9580140"," It's not looking good for the bulls. "
"9582500","9584220"," Ndx still digesting here."
"9585280","9586840"," Haven't completely rolled over."
"9588600","9590160"," Sellers, you know, seller rage here. "
"9590280","9591160"," You guys know this, right?"
"9591380","9593940"," They're just like for today tomorrow."
"9594000","9596440"," They're trying to sell into this for Wednesday."
"9596440","9597320"," We know that. "
"9597800","9599820"," We know there'll be a rug pull at some point."
"9600640","9602120"," They'll pin us into Wednesday."
"9605400","9607640"," You know, it could be today at two 30. "
"9608020","9610060"," It could be Tuesday until two 30."
"9610660","9614420"," Try to pin the market down into Jerome Powell."
"9615840","9618220"," You know my take on what I expect from Jerome. "
"9618220","9623880"," If you don't know my take on what I expect from Jerome Powell, I expect 25 BPS and a pause."
"9625160","9628320"," You will get your pause at this at this meeting."
"9629640","9630500"," I am. "
"9631150","9632860"," I am very interested."
"9634940","9642720"," If there's no pause, if he continues to talk about pause or not in the interview in the actual"
"9642720","9647080"," press release that he gives, because I don't think they're going to shock the market."
"9647820","9650700"," And so I think that they take baby steps along the way. "
"9652540","9656740"," They did change their language in the last two pressers that they've had."
"9656780","9659900"," They've been changing the language on the pause."
"9660660","9666820"," So it would seem appropriate at this point that that language would progress into. "
"9667180","9671180"," Yeah, we're going to pause and wait and see through the summer and we're going to pause."
"9671180","9672120"," I don't think you're not."
"9672280","9673400"," I don't think you're getting zero. "
"9673400","9676100"," I think you're going to get to the two 25 BPS."
"9679140","9681700"," On Wednesday, but I am fascinated."
"9682620","9684840"," If you get the 25 BPS. "
"9685900","9689100"," And there's any total change from."
"9690520","9691160"," Jerome."
"9693000","9698080"," If you're looking for that, is there a different motive than inflation?"
"9699600","9704020"," I'm sure a lot of you are going to be watching the inflation reports coming out tomorrow. "
"9705520","9706940"," I think they're going to be good."
"9708060","9709580"," I think it's going to look good."
"9710040","9710220"," But. "
"9714040","9716300"," My whole deal this week."
"9716840","9719420"," So for me, I've got some big things I'm looking for."
"9719980","9723900"," On Wednesday, I definitely am interested in the. "
"9725960","9729200"," The word salad over pause."
"9730400","9733660"," If it stays, if it stays in that word salad, like."
"9734440","9736980"," You know, we're not pausing. "
"9738380","9742300"," But, you know, we're thinking about thinking about pausing."
"9744240","9746840"," And then, so that's a big one for me."
"9747560","9748960"," Another big one. "
"9749840","9750220"," Is."
"9752920","9755280"," The week before OPEC's."
"9755620","9757500"," Which we're starting right. "
"9758280","9760220"," The returns for that week."
"9760400","9761040"," They've been horrible."
"9761680","9763320"," For the past two years. "
"9764180","9765400"," Q two."
"9765860","9767360"," Pre OPEC's."
"9768160","9770880"," Portally, OPEC's has been horrible last two years, but. "
"9771340","9772400"," In the last 20 years."
"9773020","9776340"," We haven't had three of them in a row."
"9776340","9778880"," So I'm fascinated by that data. "
"9781120","9785100"," And even so, even if we don't have a bad week, it's still not impressive."
"9785520","9786680"," It's not a huge up week."
"9787220","9788600"," So I'm interested in that stuff. "
"9789300","9790020"," Pre OPEC's."
"9790160","9792020"," I'm also interested in post OPEC's."
"9792620","9793920"," I'm also interested in. "
"9794720","9797060"," The returns that come down the road."
"9797900","9800240"," Trying to find a dip to buy something really good."
"9800800","9801680"," For the rest of the year. "
"9802860","9804820"," I'm also fascinated by."
"9805980","9808100"," Our seasonally down fall."
"9808900","9810960"," Maybe not being down this year. "
"9811960","9813720"," I didn't consider that until recently."
"9814060","9816160"," There's a few guys out there that have been talking about it on Twitter."
"9817960","9822620"," Tom's been talking about it and that guy Wayne or whatever his name has been talking about it. "
"9825560","9830660"," 1226 bulls looking for that new high on the hour to keep control of the market."
"9832240","9836520"," But also my fascinated with is of course what everybody will be fascinated with."
"9836860","9840620"," We saw a lot of talk about the JPM caller. "
"9841680","9844040"," And then it kind of kind of kind of waned right."
"9845100","9847420"," When they when they raise that lower number down there."
"9848220","9851380"," Just cut the left the discussion for a period of time. "
"9851380","9855980"," And now it's back in discussion again right."
"9856460","9857620"," What are we doing right now?"
"9857740","9858340"," What are we doing?"
"9860580","9861060"," So."
"9871040","9873620"," I'm sure that all eyes will be on that as well. "
"9874600","9876000"," Coming into the end of quarter."
"9877540","9881080"," That's end of month for June right so we have a very busy."
"9882240","9883580"," Next three weeks. "
"9884660","9886020"," Very busy."
"9886560","9888060"," Not necessarily hawkish."
"9888500","9890460"," Not necessarily bullish. "
"9893720","9895980"," But we have a lot of digestion right."
"9896300","9896620"," So like the."
"9897060","9899080"," It's like this week next week. "
"9900000","9903860"," The following week like June right now right we're in June 12."
"9904640","9905540"," Next two weeks."
"9906360","9909080"," We have a lot of digest and digesting to do. "
"9909560","9913160"," You've got new money flow coming into the market."
"9913160","9915560"," You know that hedge funds had to catch up."
"9916140","9920180"," But you also have like the money in the sidelines risk off money. "
"9921900","9926420"," You also have the treasury the treasury auctions that are going on."
"9927100","9929680"," And Jerome has to weigh all that stuff too right."
"9929800","9931160"," He's got to look at the. "
"9932760","9935900"," Refilling the the banks and all the bank."
"9937780","9942260"," And he has to also weigh this new money that's coming into the market right."
"9942260","9944320"," So we're losing some money from the market. "
"9944320","9946540"," But we have new money coming into the market right now."
"9947260","9949000"," So it's this big balancing act."
"9949340","9951480"," You've got commercial real estate down the road. "
"9952260","9954640"," Still a big question mark for summertime."
"9956780","9958800"," So these next two three weeks."
"9960600","9964520"," A lot of digested digesting to do for the next quarter. "
"9965420","9966860"," Like where we go in next quarter."

"9998970","10001130"," To see how all of this stuff gets digested."
"10001870","10004130"," It'll be major trend for the next quarter right. "
"10006930","10010790"," You kind of want you kind of want to get the play by or not play by play but the"
"10010790","10013270"," directions from the fed here."

"10282880","10284300"," These fucking assholes. "
"10298180","10300800"," Yeah, I'm going to end up wrapping up shop here at some point."
"10304520","10307360"," They ain't paying shit right now."
"10308340","10311280"," They got 431s are at 67 cents. "
"10311520","10313600"," And they're like, do you want to play ball, buddy?"
"10315220","10317460"," We ain't paying you a penny more."
"10317460","10319140"," We'll be in the money at like 22 cents."
"10329090","10329630"," Squeeze them. "
"10348020","10349580"," Just making my eyes bleed, dude."
"10355660","10356920"," 23 cents right now."
"10360940","10362440"," Dude, just give me the fucking money. "
"10362600","10363700"," Give me fucking 40 cents."
"10363980","10367820"," 24 cents right now."
"10371460","10373540"," Give me some fucking pennies. "
"10376840","10377800"," Fuck me."
"10379160","10382000"," If you want to jump out of this, I don't blame you."
"10386960","10389880"," All this for fucking 6 cents here. "
"10390160","10391160"," This is a fucking disaster."
"10393200","10396800"," Like normally, I'm serious, like 15 one-minute bars."
"10397160","10399040"," I'd be fucking up 400% right now. "
"10399880","10401500"," They ain't giving shit away."
"10402000","10404700"," They're not giving a penny away to anybody."
"10405780","10407800"," And I got something else to tell you. "
"10408520","10413580"," We got 312,000 puts at 430 that are 12 cents."
"10414380","10415980"," So there's not a fuck ton of juice left."
"10417120","10420040"," You know, like you want to take the juice from this put side, right?"
"10420420","10421960"," And pocket it in your own pocket, right?"
"10422460","10423860"," Kind of put some cash in your own pocket. "
"10424260","10426280"," And there's just not a lot of juice there."
"10426480","10427680"," There's like 12 cents left."
"10429440","10432180"," So if you're going to start closing this out, I don't blame you. "
"10438050","10439850"," I got a sell order in right now."
"10440010","10440990"," So we'll see if it fills."
"10441830","10443350"," But there's just not a lot of juice here. "
"10443430","10445290"," I'm looking at today's options chain."
"10446210","10447010"," And there just isn't much."
"10447270","10448810"," There isn't a shit ton going on. "
"10449910","10452350"," And what is going on is you've got the puts."
"10452530","10454210"," You've got 300,000 puts, right?"
"10454650","10456390"," And they're almost bled out to zero."
"10456950","10457530"," They're 12 cents. "
"10457530","10460510"," So there's not a lot of fuel."
"10461110","10468370"," We'd like 800,000 puts that are worth like $2.00 expiring today."
"10468870","10475290"," So that we can take all that money, put it in our pockets and give some to the dealers, right?"
"10475530","10476190"," They pocket some. "
"10476370","10477130"," We pocket some."
"10477670","10478910"," Fucking puts go to zero."
"10481330","10483570"," We even know the direction today, right?"
"10483570","10487430"," I mean, we pretty much call in the direction all morning. "
"10487570","10488350"," We're like, here we go."
"10488830","10490330"," Pairs down here, selling it down."
"10490630","10492890"," And they wasted their fucking time down here. "
"10492930","10493830"," We're going to give it back to the bulls."
"10494070","10494750"," There comes the bulls."
"10495290","10496470"," And they're coming back up. "
"10498250","10506630"," Yeah, I'm flat right now."
"10507110","10507950"," I just grabbed the fill."
"10508170","10509170"," I just got filled at 24. "
"10509290","10511090"," So I'm happy."
"10511610","10513550"," I guess I'm happy for whatever today is."
"10518390","10519830"," They ain't paying shit. "
"10526650","10528210"," Nice job, an XLF."
"10529550","10531770"," They are not paying shit."
"10533070","10534510"," So you saw you're nice. "
"10534710","10536510"," I want to show you guys this right now, okay?"
"10537430","10539350"," So just stay with me here."
"10541290","10547250"," Earlier, we were talking about the bounce down here, right?"
"10547250","10550450"," And we noticed that sellers."
"10551990","10553910"," We're not able to get a new low. "
"10556070","10558610"," Sellers are not able to get a new low down here, right?"
"10559190","10563910"," We're watching that down here, 11.15. Then 11.30. They didn't get a new low right here."
"10564590","10565670"," And we weren't able to do this."
"10566410","10569130"," You saw a big volume green bar down here. "
"10569590","10570230"," Buyers, right?"
"10570610","10570930"," Step it in."
"10573030","10575590"," And our first push up, we came up."
"10576870","10577430"," Right?"
"10577630","10582250"," And then we tested the 27 EMA on the five minute. "
"10582410","10589050"," And the moment we tested that, we knew that there was a very high probability trade to the upside."
"10589830","10595690"," As we came into the hour, the bulls got a new high, right?"
"10597470","10598710"," Confirming the move is higher."
"10599810","10602130"," And we started to squeeze here, right?"
"10602510","10602850"," To the upside. "
"10602850","10606630"," So you've got one trade here."
"10606810","10608570"," You've got your second trade here."
"10608670","10612070"," This one right here is the, yeah, it's definitely going to fucking happen to the upside. "
"10614750","10616470"," It's not a bad inter-day trade."
"10618310","10620230"," You know, it's what it is, right?"
"10620390","10622970"," You get a gap up here at 4.31.67 to close."
"10625110","10628270"," This previous pivot here to the upside, you'll see it right in here hiding. "
"10629210","10631570"," See if the bulls can get up there and push."
"10632130","10635950"," As we get up here, you want to be taking some off the table."
"10637450","10640450"," Right in here, wherever wrist tolerance that you have. "
"10643290","10647370"," And you're going to look for this yellow line to come up and that could possibly push us higher."
"10648270","10654430"," And this white line here will come up and we'll try to retest these and see if the move is"
"10654430","10655270"," actually higher."
"10655270","10665190"," I do want to warn you that as we squeeze these sellers out, we are going to try to"
"10665190","10666190"," grind our way. "
"10666470","10667670"," Time is working against us."
"10668570","10672670"," We are trying to grind our way to this Valhalla up here."
"10673550","10683090"," 4.36.76. As time passes, the chance of getting up there,"
"10685070","10686830"," lessons as we head into Wednesday. "
"10711740","10713520"," Yeah, please hit the like button."
"10713680","10714560"," Give me a solid too."
"10715020","10717100"," I'm going to ask you guys to do something different for me today. "
"10717740","10723920"," If you are in YouTube, could you please make a comment on the actual video?"
"10725360","10731640"," I don't care if it's nice or mean."
"10732580","10738900"," Go in the comments and just be like, I don't know, say Kevin Jim sucks or Kevin Jim is awesome."
"10739300","10743860"," The nicer or meaner it is, it doesn't matter. "
"10744160","10745520"," The algorithms will pick up on it."
"10748460","10751880"," I don't care if it's nice or evil, either way."
"10754880","10757640"," But I guess the YouTube algorithms love comments. "
"10757720","10758420"," Not in the chat."
"10758620","10761280"," I guess they love them in the fucking actual videos."
"10761560","10762620"," I mean to bring that up. "
"10764220","10769380"," So if you are on a PC or something, let's go in there and leave a comment of some kind."
"10774340","10775480"," I heart you too guys."
"10776100","10777200"," I love all you guys out there. "
"10781820","10783820"," Captain Jim stole my life and my job."
"10784000","10785320"," I still watch every day right on."
"10789340","10790840"," It's normally a better show. "
"10791040","10791560"," I apologize."
"10791900","10792820"," I'm a little I'm a little top."
"10793000","10794460"," Well, first off, I'm a little tired today. "
"10794580","10797720"," I worked all weekend like the entire weekend I worked."
"10798820","10801340"," And then I was trying to help my family out."
"10801700","10803720"," I built a kayak. "
"10804940","10806960"," So when I got here, let me see if I can draw this."
"10809040","10811480"," I got a ski wagon, right?"
"10813080","10814860"," It's a Cadillac Escalade."
"10816140","10818320"," I used to have my ski wagons out west. "
"10818540","10819200"," I had to conform."
"10819460","10820180"," I had like a Toyota."
"10821380","10826340"," But in the city of East, everyone's got like an Escalade. "
"10826720","10828120"," So I got to have an Escalade here."
"10828460","10829260"," Don't at me on that."
"10829520","10830200"," Why I did that?"
"10830320","10831400"," But I don't know why I did it. "
"10832060","10833300"," So I have an Escalade, right?"
"10833540","10842660"," So my Escalade, if this is it right here, let's say, I have a like a Yamaka"
"10842660","10847420"," Skybox on the top of it right here."
"10849960","10851420"," This is the windshield, I guess."
"10853000","10855900"," This is the pimp baller grill in the front. "
"10856560","10858580"," I look like a fucking tool in this thing too."
"10858880","10860240"," I can't stand this truck, but whatever."
"10860240","10861620"," That's what I'm driving right now. "
"10862140","10862900"," It's my ski wagon."
"10862900","10863480"," Take it skiing."
"10863680","10865380"," It's got heated leather, heated seats. "
"10865880","10867200"," It's got all those nice shit kids love it."
"10867780","10869320"," I can bring the dogs in it."
"10869840","10871100"," It's fucking long as fuck. "
"10871260","10872280"," It's like 40 feet long."
"10873180","10875340"," We have this giant ski box on here, right?"
"10875500","10875820"," Take this."
"10876060","10878960"," So I put all my, put all my sailing shit in there. "
"10879400","10882080"," Put all my like fucking anything at the water for the summer."
"10883520","10886060"," And we bring food and stuff to get on the sailboat."
"10886520","10889180"," And I bring a bunch of shit to go camping and shit with the sailboat and all that stuff. "
"10889180","10897160"," So this weekend, what I did was I built a PVC kayak with like two wings on this side and"
"10897160","10898700"," two wings on this side."
"10899340","10902420"," So I got like, so I got like Hakka kayak right here."
"10904840","10909300"," And then the other kayak doesn't fit on the other side because the goddamn sky box is so big. "
"10910660","10913500"," I'm hoping that I can stick another kayak right here."
"10913640","10918400"," I'm going to look like, I'm going to look so whacked out when I'm driving down the road and this"
"10918400","10921540"," thing because it's going to have like the sky box, two kayaks on it."
"10923020","10925240"," Like, like, subboard over here. "
"10925760","10930220"," A bunch of like tubes and stuff over here."
"10930560","10931340"," A bunch of crap."
"10931880","10937520"," We're driving down looking like, uh, Sanford and Sons driving through Detroit with my crap on top"
"10937520","10937940"," of my truck. "
"10939200","10945360"," Now, the cool part about this, the cool part about this PVC thing that I built right here is that"
"10945360","10946800"," these big poles come off."
"10946800","10947860"," Like, I can remove them."
"10948000","10948740"," Like, they just pull them off. "
"10948880","10950140"," They got like little D-rings on them."
"10950740","10953600"," So it doesn't look so bad when I don't have them on top of the truck."
"10954300","10959100"," But you should see me driving down the road because I've got, I got like these poles hanging out on"
"10959100","10959740"," the side of the truck. "
"10960320","10962100"," I got the, I kid you not, it's not a joke."
"10962420","10964800"," I got the, I got the sky box up there."
"10965020","10968920"," I got two kayaks, a subboard. "
"10970340","10974280"," I don't have the, the, the, the, the inner tubes and shit out there."
"10974340","10975240"," I'm just joking on that one."
"10975240","10979020"," But then in the back of the truck, I got a four, four bike bike rack. "
"10979260","10981680"," So you got four bikes hanging off the back."
"10982400","10987640"," Pull a bunch of other shit and I'm like driving back and forth every weekend to go party."
"10992720","10996720"," If you see me driving down the road and Detroit with all that shit, that's me. "
"10997500","11001540"," If you see a guy in Detroit driving down through the roads with that shit, that's me."
"11001920","11002860"," Say wave hi."
"11004680","11009260"," And I think, and being in Detroit, people are like, they've got like two different people looking"
"11009260","11009600"," at me. "
"11010180","11012640"," Like one person's like, what the fuck is that guy doing?"
"11013300","11017620"," And then I think that like a very small percentage of those people are like, dude, I want to go"
"11017620","11018400"," with that guy over there."
"11018540","11019380"," What's, where's that guy going?"
"11026900","11028040"," It's super sketchy."
"11028200","11029140"," I'll take a picture of it. "
"11029140","11032040"," I'll take a fucking picture of it and show you it all loaded up."
"11036540","11041820"," So I did was I've got the roof rack up there with the skybox on the roof rack and then"
"11041820","11045340"," I mounted a bunch of two inch PVC on the crossbars."
"11045760","11046700"," I'll show it to you guys. "
"11046880","11047260"," It's wild."
"11053460","11057320"," Yeah, I did."
"11057500","11059340"," So I did was I did paint the PVC. "
"11060320","11062060"," I put a protective coat on top of it."
"11062600","11066020"," And the in the rods, I can remove the rest of it."
"11066120","11071060"," I glued, but the rods themselves, I take them off so they don't sit in the sun. "
"11071820","11073040"," So I pull the rods off."
"11073160","11074480"," I take all the shit off the top of the truck."
"11076100","11077280"," Now, but I do agree with you. "
"11077340","11077820"," It's not a permanent."
"11078240","11080280"," So I was looking at actual racks for it."
"11081100","11083560"," I couldn't get the fucking racks on with the skybox. "
"11084040","11084900"," It wasn't enough room."
"11085940","11091300"," Another idea was to extend the racks out to the left and right and then put the racks on."
"11091600","11092260"," That would work. "
"11098500","11100220"," Oh, look at these sellers, man."
"11101480","11103160"," Yeah, you think you did some bare music here?"
"11103360","11104780"," I am definitely not."
"11105080","11106300"," I'm not long or short now. "
"11106380","11107160"," I took my money and ran."
"11107320","11107920"," I'm just sitting here."
"11110760","11112520"," You guys want to revenge sell this down?"
"11116240","11117940"," Let's take a look around the market at some. "
"11118120","11120460"," Let's take a look at some tickers here."
"11121740","11123020"," Let's look at some money."
"11124880","11126160"," Let's see if we can look at some money. "
"11126460","11126920"," Hold on here."
"11130240","11131960"," Let's see if we can make some money here today."
"11134580","11136880"," Let's see if there's any other opportunities out there. "
"11145730","11147030"," Yeah, so that's me and my."
"11147390","11148470"," Any guys do that?"
"11148550","11149350"," Any guys live out west?"
"11149890","11150230"," Any guys?"
"11150230","11152970"," I mean, look at this right now."
"11153070","11155730"," This looks like it wants to rip some faces off. "
"11155930","11156430"," Just look at that."
"11156510","11157330"," That's the spy, dude."
"11159990","11162470"," Spy wants to F-U-C-K right now. "
"11162630","11167110"," It wants to rip some faces off to the upside."
"11168030","11172390"," It wants to tag 432 in some change."
"11173110","11176550"," This is the trade that I was taking, by the way, to the upside. "
"11176550","11178630"," But they are like here, man."
"11178830","11181350"," They're just trying right now to stop that from happening."
"11183050","11184990"," Let's take a look at some tickers here. "
"11186890","11187370"," Duolingo."
"11188070","11189770"," Let's talk about some of these tickers here."
"11190490","11191910"," Duolingo has been a heavy printer. "
"11193130","11195130"," It's been for doing very well for us, right?"
"11197390","11201390"," We know that we have some possibility of some down coming up."
"11201510","11202210"," I want you to realize that."

"11211170","11215250"," I want you to pay attention to some of these tickers for potential dip buy. "
"11216890","11217330"," Duolingo."
"11218110","11220290"," It's still trading inside of its trend, right?"
"11220990","11221390"," It looks great."
"11221790","11222250"," Ticker looks great. "
"11222850","11224570"," It is getting a little long in the tooth."
"11225970","11229130"," But you can see that dip was just bought down here, right?"

"11250830","11258070"," So upside target on Duolingo, 156.56. If it can trade above 156.56. I am going to be looking"
"11258070","11261230"," for a higher high on this one at 173."
"11261230","11263110"," On Duolingo."

"11271030","11273490"," Every time it touches its hourly, it gets bought."
"11274190","11274410"," 7141."
"11275470","11279890"," If it comes back down and holds, you can put a nice stop underneath it. "
"11281490","11283490"," 7141 as it grinds higher."
"11284070","11286770"," Personally, this week I would love to buy."
"11286770","11291530"," If we can come back down, I'd love to buy like 68, 68, 24. "
"11293350","11294650"," Toast, baby."
"11296110","11297570"," My man, toast."
"11299190","11301430"," Trading its channel like nobody's business. "
"11302190","11303850"," Super duper bullish, believe it or not."
"11304630","11307310"," That yellow line was our initial call out, right?"
"11307610","11308410"," Can it hit 2296?"
"11309410","11311030"," You bet your ass that Canada did."

"11321030","11322450"," It was just ripping faces off."
"11323370","11330550"," Next buy on toast is 22.22. I'd love to get a pullback on this one in the next couple"

"11331510","11334890"," If that can happen, you have something like this, maybe four or five days pass. "
"11335590","11336670"," It does some consolidating."
"11337070","11339170"," Boom, right back on track to the upside."
"11340050","11343090"," You know that there are some previous sellers here on this yellow line. "
"11343090","11343970"," Right?"
"11344210","11346330"," They're just trying to get out there feeding into you."
"11346730","11349470"," Hopefully we can consolidate in here and get another blast higher."

"11367850","11369430"," $11, baby."
"11369430","11375450"," As long as price stays above, $9.01, target above $11. "
"11376330","11380610"," Another thing to take note of in this is if it does roll over at any point, look for $7 "
"11380610","11388590",".69. I-O-N-Q, trading underneath its hourly trigger."
"11389650","11391410"," What happens when that happens, right?"
"11391650","11394050"," We're going to pay attention, be safe down here."
"11394430","11403230"," Our ultimate target above is $11.75. Set an alert down below for $10.18. We also need time for"
"11403230","11405430"," the daily to catch back up here, right?"
"11405730","11410270"," Just waiting for the daily to come up here and go, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop. "
"11411330","11412610"," Hourly's going to swoop down."
"11413650","11414130"," Consolidate."
"11414650","11415430"," Wham to the upside. "
"11416450","11420790"," $11.50. I-O-N-Q."
"11422410","11424010"," Next one, another regular printer."
"11424550","11426110"," Doing its thing right now. "
"11426810","11427290"," Fip."
"11427970","11428770"," What are you doing?"
"11428950","11429210"," Fip."
"11429590","11431950"," Fip is just grinding higher, right?"
"11432690","11434770"," Looks like it just got dip-bought here. "
"11434830","11441210"," $3.45. Look for also $3.33. There is a little bit of this action going on."
"11441290","11442590"," I want us to see this here, okay?"
"11443390","11444870"," Looks like the dip was bought."
"11445190","11446750"," I think it's ready to rock right now. "
"11447290","11448630"," Right up here, targeting three."
"11449370","11449990"," We got up there."
"11454230","11459930"," $3.85. $3.85. $3.85. $3.80. Somewhere in there. "
"11460170","11468190"," But if you can catch a roll up in here, it might be a sexier buy down here at $3 "
"11468190","11472910",".25. So maybe setting alert at $3.25. If you miss this run higher, too bad."
"11473090","11476530"," But if it does come back down, you might get a really sexy, just like this one."
"11477390","11480670"," Get a quick roll, come back down, boom, blast up higher. "
"11480670","11481390"," Fit."
"11482530","11484550"," Wait till we check back on these in a year."
"11487870","11491950"," Pro-core PCOR. "
"11492870","11494250"," Boom, another one."
"11494810","11496950"," Just smashing and bashing to the upside, right?"
"11497670","11500630"," Separation of price, the hourly, the daily and the weekly here."
"11501190","11502250"," It's just moving right along. "
"11502630","11503970"," Looking to pump, pump, pump."
"11504470","11505090"," Target above."
"11505930","11507010"," Next target, we hit 63. "
"11507010","11508730"," And now what are we targeting?"
"11509090","11511130"," 68.01. Baby."
"11511710","11514430"," Then we're looking for 72 bucks on the upside."
"11515570","11516050"," PCOR. "
"11516530","11517010"," Whoo."
"11518630","11519310"," Hashi Corp."

"11522270","11522730"," Hashi Corp. "
"11522970","11523350"," Down here."
"11523870","11525670"," We're talking about this one the other day."
"11525810","11526730"," This was not one of the picks. "
"11526970","11527750"," It was a previous pick."
"11528570","11531690"," We had this target above a 33.84. Tagged it."
"11532030","11533670"," Immediately got sold down in some earnings. "
"11533670","11541850"," And we're looking down here for consolidation at $20, $23, $24 for a continuation higher."
"11542130","11544390"," There is some risk on this ticker here."
"11544950","11546590"," So we got our initial tag above. "
"11547130","11548850"," Tagged it again, right?"
"11549030","11551030"," We've been buying the dip all the way back here, right?"
"11551730","11552990"," Buy the dip, sell the rip."
"11553210","11554110"," Buy the dip, sell the rip."
"11554350","11555210"," Buy the dip, sell the rip. "
"11555650","11557670"," Some people came on there like, oh, cap."
"11557670","11559670"," That E.R. on Hashi Corp."
"11559910","11560410"," Mike Nana. "
"11560550","11563070"," This is take the money and run and buy the dip again."
"11563650","11565270"," There is a key point here though."
"11565730","11568070"," We do not want to see Hashi Corp. "
"11568770","11571470"," Daily come down and start to sell this ticker down."
"11571970","11574690"," So for the next trade on Hashi Corp."
"11574850","11577570"," You're looking forward to come back and trade above. "
"11577710","11578330"," Listen closely."
"11579090","11583690"," It must regain $30 for that next trade higher to attack."
"11586190","11591430"," $41.67. So anything above $30 on Hashi Corp. "
"11593050","11593970"," Sholes, baby."

"11611170","11613070"," bit and see all this stuff here."
"11613070","11617270"," It's closing out $26.74. Look to take profit soon. "
"11617950","11625790"," We have another target above $27.68. Another target at $29.84. Some Valhalla shit up here at $31.97"
"11625790","11627610"," on Sholes."

"11634770","11635850"," All that consolidation. "
"11636310","11637890"," We're not catching knives down here, right?"
"11638550","11640310"," You're not getting all cut up down here."
"11640430","11641490"," And look at what it's doing finally."
"11641490","11643270"," Ripping faces off. "
"11644490","11645070"," CFLT."
"11645770","11647470"," It's got a little bit more to go."
"11647630","11650710"," Let's call it $3.905. Then some consolidation. "
"11651530","11660110"," And then the big bad boy up top $75.87. This is a place to take profit and look for"
"11660110","11664750"," a dip buy on Confluent at $30."
"11666370","11667470"," Somewhere in here."
"11667690","11668970"," You're going to see something like this. "
"11669810","11671050"," Something like that."
"11671390","11675010"," And then we're making that giant move into the 70s."
"11676770","11677250"," CFLT. "
"11681750","11683770"," Oh, what do we got going on down here?"
"11684550","11685210"," That old cut."

"11692370","11692970"," Consolidating now."
"11693530","11694870"," Waiting for the daily to get up here. "
"11694950","11695630"," It's almost ready."
"11695990","11701010"," Price gets above $3.25. And it's going to rip some faces off here."
"11701450","11702070"," Price target. "
"11703330","11703930"," $4."
"11704210","11705490"," That's just called a flat $4."
"11707670","11708870"," SMRT consolidates. "
"11709570","11712490"," Not showing any signs of selling off here."
"11712610","11713350"," It's just consolidation."
"11714290","11717410"," It stops below $3.29 on SMRT. "
"11720490","11722070"," Oh, yes, bye."
"11723510","11725010"," You want to go over some other ones?"
"11725790","11728330"," Should we add some more?"

"11942160","11943180"," We're not buying no fucking."
"11943360","11944660"," We're not buying no falling knives. "
"11945340","11947160"," We're looking for tickers that are being moved."
"11948000","11949420"," That's what we're looking for, right?"
"11950480","11953000"," Set an alert down below on NXT."
"11954900","11956840"," $38.23. NXT. "

"11971790","11973670"," We'll come back and look at it right down there."
"11974150","11977410"," $38.39. Love it."

"11978750","11979170"," Love it."
"11979450","11980230"," Right down there."
"11980230","11984850"," If you have like a hundred or a thousand of these tickers at home, if you have a hundred of"
"11984850","11989650"," these, a thousand of these, and if they don't hit for you and they just keep running, you miss it,"
"11989950","11994530"," I guarantee there's like two or three or four or five that do pop up and they tell you, hey,"
"11994750","11995110"," we're ready. "
"11996130","11997310"," You can get it on those trades."
"11998090","11998670"," Ooh, NXT."
"11999290","11999670"," Or is that it?"
"11999750","12000250"," Did I get the right one?"
"12000550","12001310"," Yeah, NXT, man. "

"12042390","12043510"," A cross here. "
"12043630","12045110"," We're a little overbought right now."
"12045610","12046830"," I don't like this down here."
"12047410","12049210"," So let's look for a dip buy on this one. "
"12049610","12050130"," VRZE."
"12051450","12053250"," At 38, 36 bucks."
"12054190","12061670"," Possibly even if you're really cheap like I am waiting for like 32, 34 for continuation to the"

"12092020","12094320"," Unity software primed for liftoff."
"12095020","12096540"," Look at the unity, man."
"12096780","12098620"," Unity is like, oh, boss, man. "
"12098740","12099240"," We're going places."

"12106840","12107800"," Like, yeah, we got a shark, brother."
"12108320","12109040"," I'm like, are you serious?"
"12109180","12109880"," We got a shark here?"
"12110020","12110340"," What does he got?"
"12110520","12114880"," He's got fins and he's got a fat, some kind down here."
"12115420","12117000"," He's got these little shark eyes. "
"12117340","12120380"," He's got some teeth and he's coming up from the depths of hell down here."
"12120520","12121620"," Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't."
"12121740","12126420"," Always waiting for us that one capitulation move down here and then rip some faces off right here"
"12126420","12126900"," to the upside. "
"12127740","12130280"," So we got unity software."
"12130820","12134780"," Well, this is a meme fucking stonk for Wall Street, but that's a fair of a was one."
"12135240","12136420"," Right down in there. "
"12136560","12137200"," I want to catch it."
"12137400","12138560"," I want to catch it right down here."
"12139120","12142760"," It's like some kind of stupid reason to sell some kind of bullshit and then wham. "
"12143400","12144540"," Right to the fucking upside."
"12145580","12148400"," Looking for $33, $32 on unity."
"12150720","12151560"," Don't, don't, don't, don't. "
"12151680","12152920"," If you miss it, don't worry about it."
"12152960","12155080"," We got more coming your way."
"12157660","12158020"," IoT. "
"12158860","12159440"," Next one."

"12163740","12164220"," Ooh."
"12164600","12166720"," I feel like I'm a Jim Kramer right now."
"12169260","12170480"," What do we got here, right?"
"12170660","12171580"," IoT baby. "
"12171880","12172380"," Look at this one."
"12172660","12174720"," We don't buy fucking, we don't catch knives."
"12175500","12177620"," We don't catch fucking knives. "
"12178540","12179300"," What do we do?"
"12180240","12185340"," We look for a new tech company that's released, that has an IPO within three years."
"12185960","12186760"," We have consolidation."
"12188180","12190680"," We let all these people sit in this shit. "
"12191180","12193520"," And then we buy these bam to the upside."
"12194280","12195960"," Trending higher right now."
"12196340","12196860"," IoT. "
"12198060","12198580"," Squeezing."
"12199060","12200500"," Still not done squeezing."
"12201280","12205440"," As long as we stay above $29.15, we'll not stop to the upside. "
"12205980","12209160"," Although I do think this one here is a little long in the tooth."
"12209440","12217480"," So maybe up here, double top, come back down and get a dose of I like this ticker too."
"12218200","12218940"," You see it, right?"
"12219680","12220520"," You see it, right?"
"12220680","12222720"," Why not just get with trend being your friend?"
"12223220","12229680"," Why try to buy a knife rather than catch something that's already moving for you?"
"12229680","12231640"," It's already going the way you want it to go. "
"12232580","12233340"," Already going."
"12233600","12236660"," Hopefully I can get a dip bite down here at 2324 and it doesn't leave me behind."
"12237780","12238660"," IoT baby. "
"12239420","12239740"," IoT."
"12240080","12241400"," Call that one out earlier this morning."

"12255560","12256660"," To the fund, right?"
"12256880","12256940"," Boom."
"12257220","12257320"," Done."
"12258000","12258940"," What's FLNC doing?"
"12259220","12259260"," Hmm. "
"12259460","12260160"," Seems like it's moving."
"12260780","12261860"," Seems pretty fucking bullish."
"12262560","12264160"," Seems like it was consolidating over here. "
"12264460","12265620"," This looks like the spoons, right?"
"12265840","12266320"," Looks like Spy."
"12266940","12267780"," Separation in price."
"12268020","12268220"," The hourly. "
"12268540","12270020"," The daily and the weekly."
"12270640","12271040"," What's it doing?"
"12271040","12273780"," It's going the fuck up is what it's doing, right?"
"12274180","12278760"," Trade in 2605 looking for another tag on high to 2829."
"12279300","12281040"," Can I get a dip buy on this one please?"
"12281240","12282500"," Please give me something down here. "
"12282860","12284260"," Give me another dip buy down here."
"12284420","12285820"," Let me jump on board the train."
"12286360","12288540"," I want on the train to the upside. "
"12289000","12289440"," FLNC."
"12291820","12293500"," We already got choles, right?"
"12294360","12294840"," We got toast."
"12295800","12296480"," How about LMD?"
"12297380","12297760"," LMD. "
"12297760","12297900"," LMD."
"12300200","12300580"," LMD."
"12301140","12301520"," LMD. "
"12302220","12304940"," This one trapped a whole bunch of people in it, didn't it?"
"12305560","12306940"," A whole bunch of people in it."
"12307400","12308680"," Yeah, there it is right there."
"12309160","12312220"," All these bulls up here crying, whining. "
"12312640","12314960"," Oh, no, I got trapped in a lemonade."
"12314960","12315940"," I've been sitting in for years."
"12316640","12317000"," Don't worry. "
"12317580","12318200"," Don't worry."
"12319500","12321520"," Well, you got trapped and now you're capitulating."
"12321640","12322280"," Guess what you're going to do?"
"12322400","12324400"," You're going to buy the top again for me on lemonade. "
"12324820","12325660"," That's what you're going to do."
"12325920","12327300"," You're going to do it one more time for me."
"12327760","12328760"," It's a right down here. "
"12328840","12330740"," Daily turn across on the weekly hourly."
"12331140","12332380"," Just trading it up right now."
"12333000","12334940"," Can I get another dip buy in lemonade, please?"
"12335600","12336160"," Where, cap?"
"12336460","12337980"," Where can I get a dip buy in lemonade?"
"12338100","12338620"," Well, shit, man. "
"12338720","12339480"," Come on back down."
"12340120","12341940"," Tap that 20 to bucks for me one more time."
"12342060","12342420"," Is it going to?"
"12342540","12343060"," Probably not. "
"12343300","12347800"," As long as we stay above right now, 1962, the move is higher for lemonade."
"12348300","12352700"," If we get a market move to the downside this week from volatility or next week."
"12353160","12355000"," I want to jump right back in on this train, man. "
"12355080","12355680"," That's what I want to do."
"12355680","12357000"," I really want to buy $17."
"12357340","12358060"," Fuck that 20. "
"12358640","12359540"," Another week or two."
"12360000","12362200"," Give me, give me $17.18 on a week or two."
"12362300","12364700"," Please, please just do it for me right there. "
"12365480","12365920"," Lemonade."
"12370200","12371080"," Hold on."
"12372840","12373720"," LMD, baby. "
"12375820","12377500"," Don't worry, you'll jump back on it again."
"12378000","12380640"," I promise when it's already 100 bucks, you'll be back on lemonade."
"12380740","12381700"," I assure you. "
"12386140","12386580"," CRDO."
"12389520","12390260"," Next one."
"12390980","12391520"," Look at that. "
"12391740","12392040"," Shocker."
"12393080","12393860"," Are we buying dips?"
"12394380","12395480"," Are we buying fallen knives?"
"12395820","12397740"," Fuck no, we ain't buying no fucking fallen knives."
"12399260","12400660"," We're buying shit that's moving. "
"12401880","12403280"," Look at it right here, right?"
"12403780","12405620"," This is very similar to a ticker."
"12405660","12407220"," We just looked at a few minutes ago, right?"
"12407900","12412300"," Came back down, consolidated, ripped face again all the way up, right?"
"12412620","12414920"," Just looking at a ticker like that just a few minutes ago, right?"
"12414920","12416680"," So what are you looking for here in this one?"
"12417220","12417620"," CRDO."
"12421520","12424240"," One of these pops up and you go, oh, there it goes right there. "
"12424320","12425240"," It's almost ready for me to buy."
"12426400","12426640"," Right?"
"12426960","12427320"," Here we go."
"12427940","12428880"," CRDO, baby. "
"12429600","12433700"," As long as it stays above 1637, we are bullish to the upside."
"12434320","12439660"," Hopefully we get a dip buy once again like we did before down here at 1307."
"12439800","12442980"," Look for 1307 on CRDO. "
"12448540","12450760"," T-S-V-T, that sounds like a..."
"12450760","12453300"," T-S-V-T sounds like a..."
"12453300","12456240"," Oh, it's a biostock, that answers it."
"12457520","12459360"," T-S-V-T sounds like a venereal disease."
"12460560","12463960"," Oh, this one's almost ready, this one's primed. "
"12464720","12465240"," Oh, this is juicy."
"12466640","12468120"," I'm going to warn you on these biostocks."
"12468400","12470940"," I normally don't like putting them inside of our..."
"12470940","12476860"," I don't normally like putting these inside of our portfolio because they're normally news driven. "
"12477620","12479080"," But keep an eye on it."
"12479400","12480700"," Keep an eye on this one."
"12481380","12484320"," You need to do some due diligence on stocks like this. "
"12485020","12486220"," They're usually news driven."
"12486720","12487720"," Normally they sell the news."
"12488880","12494520"," But down here, possibly a dip buy at 1160, 1163 with a tight stop underneath it. "
"12495040","12498000"," But I'm interested in this one for an explosive move to the upside."
"12499180","12500740"," So just pay attention to this one."
"12500800","12503360"," This is not one of my favorites. "
"12503360","12508080"," I don't like putting these in the portfolio, but T-S-V-T, keep an eye on it."
"12509000","12510300"," I'm not going to add it to the portfolio."
"12512820","12514180"," Next one, rum. "
"12517940","12519420"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"12519700","12522120"," We buy no fucking...we buy no fallen knives."
"12523060","12523860"," Look at that, dude. "
"12524080","12526280"," Look at that beautiful consolidation in there."
"12527160","12527240"," Right?"
"12527660","12530520"," Oh, a bunch of trap fires up here, whining and crying."
"12531360","12531700"," That's all that. "
"12531860","12532880"," You guys all crying up there."
"12533120","12533800"," Oh, what's that back there?"
"12533800","12534920"," Ooh, more."
"12535100","12535740"," Are you crying up here?"
"12535920","12537120"," You all feelings a hurt?"
"12537620","12538420"," Yeah, I don't care. "
"12540520","12544140"," You're probably out there and you're like capitulated, sold, pissed off."
"12544540","12545500"," Now you see it going up."
"12546240","12547700"," You're going to fuel the run higher now. "
"12548340","12549520"," You're all pissy about it."
"12550180","12550940"," Target's up here."
"12551080","12551380"," What do we got?"
"12551560","12552040"," 12 bucks. "
"12552360","12554200"," We got 18 or something like that back there."
"12554740","12557520"," Please give me a dip buy on rum."
"12558940","12563280"," Something down here, like $10.44. Look at that. "
"12563800","12566340"," Price, hourly, daily, weekly."
