"6790","10410"," Check one check check check check one check."
"67550","68830"," Where's this stuff?"
"73050","83220"," Oh, yeah,"
"83220","83480"," baby."
"83480","84100"," Good morning. "
"84100","85420"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"88560","106900"," Oh, just"
"106900","107500"," a second here."
"116510","117510"," All right."
"120890","124050"," Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. "
"131430","133030"," Jen's back there for you."
"133930","134970"," Good morning, everybody."
"138470","139670"," Good morning. "
"140610","142570"," How is everyone doing here?"
"143850","145610"," This is up for you here to get started."
"150710","152970"," We have, let's see here."
"154390","163360"," to a previous low right here, previous low for that yellow line right there. "
"164100","169500"," We just tagged the pre-market low right here."
"170000","172820"," So I'm going to get rid of this one right here, but this was the pre-market low."
"174200","177860"," There's a pre-market high here and here. "
"178500","180320"," I'll just leave it right here so you know it's there."
"182040","186780"," We'll just start working our way up and down as the algorithms clear out."
"189220","190820"," I think we have some pre-market. "
"190940","195960"," I think we have some low or I think we have some gaps that have been filled a couple days"
"195960","197160"," ago, a few days ago as well."
"198540","200240"," So there's a few things we have to look at this morning."
"205620","209960"," So we're going to look at a couple things, but for the bears that are out there and for bulls"
"209960","212440"," that are out there, there's a couple things that I need you to know this morning, okay?"
"213700","215720"," But I'll say how high do you guys here in just a moment. "
"217020","224190"," Just to get started here, just to get started here."
"225930","232250"," You can see right off the bell this morning, this is Tesla and I posted something on"
"233750","239290"," posted something right here."
"239730","245310"," I don't know what time it was, 9.30 and I think I said if you lose 2.12.70"
"245310","251190"," or something like that, to look for 203 and it's sold right off. "
"251490","253810"," So if you're a bear, congratulations."
"257930","262650"," Right down here, we might not tag the 203.50. Look at the bounce right here."
"263870","273510"," The key here for bears is that you'll want to be teeing off right now, 209.78,"
"273930","276730"," looking for that 203 down below. "
"277550","281150"," Okay, so now you see this five minutes kind of curling up."
"281150","282810"," So this is probably bottom for the moment."
"283150","292830"," If you're a bear, you want to be looking to reject again at 209.53. Though velocity is, and here's"
"292830","293690"," the deal here. "
"293930","298410"," So velocity is slowing on Tesla right now on the downward side or downward move."
"299110","300730"," You can see the five minute curling up."
"301110","302270"," Bears don't want to see that. "
"303030","305290"," So you see this five minute right here curling up."
"306350","312490"," If the five minute was curling down, it would be worse for bulls."
"313070","315390"," So you can see this red here is kind of curling up. "
"315610","319850"," If it was curling down, screaming down like this, that would be pretty bad for bears."
"321370","325510"," You still could see it some teeing up here to recheck down below."
"325890","333750"," One of the good things for bulls today is the options market is not really priced in for a down"
"333750","334510"," velocity move. "
"335130","340210"," So even this move that we're having this morning is it has no velocity behind it."
"340550","343130"," I know I'm sure that there's some bulls out there that are freaking out."
"343710","346810"," We'll talk about the coming week into two weeks. "
"346810","350250"," We'll talk about October, November, December, January, February."
"350790","351970"," You can't be a bull."
"352530","357850"," Well, you can't have a low volatility market and not have a down week every month. "
"358190","360970"," We can look back on every bull run we've ever had."
"361330","370570"," Even in the best of bull runs, there's usually a down period heading into OPEC's every month."
"371350","375350"," And price sometimes picks up velocity and other times it doesn't. "
"375690","383610"," So far, we're not actually, we don't have any downward price velocity along with the rotation that"
"383610","383950"," we're in."
"385110","396190"," The rotation down is more reminiscent of December than it is of the first half and"
"396190","401530"," parts of maybe 60% of 2022, at least for the indexes."
"403270","407930"," So we'll get spy real quick and some key points for spy right here. "
"410050","412350"," And we're not having the price."
"412370","414870"," We're not having price at this moment this morning."
"416130","420830"," At this moment, price isn't leading us down. "
"421070","422870"," And this is mostly due to the options market."
"423610","428670"," Remember yesterday when we're talking, I said to you, options market was priced in right around"
"428670","428910"," 210."
"430470","433210"," So move down to, hold on a second here. "
"435550","439970"," But the options market was priced in down the options market at the after the close yesterday."
"440990","443970"," The CME data came in at 407."
"445890","447510"," Yesterday's data was at 410. "
"448090","448710"," So right in here."
"449550","456190"," And we tagged it already again on the opening bell on the spy."
"456710","459350"," And that's pretty much where the options market is priced in. "
"459770","461390"," We're going to turn this into a yellow."
"462670","465410"," Now this is priced in yesterday at 210."
"467690","475510"," But we do have some lower targets due to the options market this morning or the options data this"
"475510","475710"," morning. "
"475850","477770"," I believe it's what you'll look at it right here."
"478170","479250"," A second here."
"482040","484120"," I'll find out what it is right now. "
"484220","488860"," The options market data, the implied move for today's expiry."
"490000","491200"," And then just a second here."
"494470","497710"," I want some walking in this here in the background. "
"498110","498930"," Let's see if they're updating it."
"514850","515929"," Just a second here."
"523550","524530"," Come on now. "
"525530","526230"," Give me the new data."
"529310","532350"," We know hot fresh data morning data, baby."
"542300","544000"," Data is, you know, all right. "
"547060","554640"," 408.39. So, you know, even though 408.39 on the lower end."
"557040","561980"," We're not quite priced in today for much range expansion as my point."
"562920","564460"," So, like right down here. "
"567300","572540"," You know, even even whenever down move we have today, we can we can trade out of range, but you"
"572540","580180"," know, you're not expecting massive price moves down this morning as of yet."
"580260","581980"," So, and that's my point."
"582200","585640"," I made a point this point on Twitter this morning to another point. "
"585740","587760"," I mean, towards when it looks like paying itself up."
"588360","593600"," And that would just be that we have a previous low here that there's 409."
"595240","600080"," You know, bears want to work on at least getting that new low, even if it's revisited later down"
"600080","600440"," the road. "
"603160","607640"," So, bears are going to be attempting to get that that new low."
"610420","615140"," That's not surprisingly."
"616020","620300"," 408.53. Not surprisingly, this is where the option market is priced this morning. "
"621200","623440"," So, you may be looking for a new low today."
"623760","625000"," Bears are going to be looking for a new low today."
"625160","626000"," They don't want to give up. "
"627000","630000"," Bears definitely don't, I mean, they don't want to give up for 1091."
"631200","634780"," Not just for 1140 or 4132 currently."
"635840","637860"," They don't want to give that up either, right?"
"637980","641580"," They want to keep the pressure on here right with this boxes right here. "
"642480","644800"," And get some, get some rejection going."
"645280","647180"," Get underneath this and at least tag this."
"647660","649700"," Even if we have a run higher for the day. "
"649960","652340"," So, this is what the bears are looking for here."
"653000","656220"," Do we trade below the implied move today?"
"656400","658240"," Not really unless we get some real money selling."
"659520","660780"," We start selling calls. "
"661700","663640"," We start buying some puts, that kind of stuff."
"664560","665740"," Not really expecting that."
"665860","668000"," There's no news to expect that to happen today. "
"668500","672760"," And truly, the biggest news we have, the biggest ball for the week, unless there's something"
"672760","673020"," unknown."
"674380","679020"," And not price then is going to be tomorrow's news."
"679420","684060"," Now, upward target is 4.13.04. And you can see it right here. "
"685400","689780"," A separate target for the 4.13.04. Not a lot, but I think yesterday I told you not to"
"689780","691440"," expect too much action today."
"692180","693680"," And we're not seeing it right now, right?"
"694140","695280"," We're just ping ponging around."
"696060","697020"," You can kind of see it, right?"
"697660","700240"," You got a bears wanting to get a new low at some point today. "
"700240","701880"," They want to get a rejection, get a new low."
"702900","708020"," And then they do want to hold this 4.11.40, but we can easily trade up here, squeeze up"
"708020","708260"," here."
"709000","714640"," Yesterday we began to see in the market, so you guys can see all this stuff here for now. "
"714860","715760"," We'll keep watching it."
"716260","719360"," You can make your own little boxes if you want, right?"
"719940","722620"," Our trading zone, what we should be trading today."
"724940","729060"," You can make this a green box down below if we can get down there and make it for a"
"729060","732880"," great long down here, right?"
"732980","734400"," Great long down here to take. "
"734640","736040"," You could long this down here."
"736200","738620"," Here's one first rejection point, second rejection point."
"739520","743500"," Now with all of that said, and we'll draw these right now. "
"743780","745880"," I'll draw you a little box on this one here."
"747840","750240"," And here's a little yellow box here for the bulls."
"753860","761020"," But we're going to talk about some stuff because I want to show you guys 4.70 somewhere down here,"
"761460","765360"," right down here. "
"766380","768320"," There's one to get this new low down here."
"769240","770320"," Let's see it right here."
"771400","773320"," All right, they just want to tag this new low if they can. "
"774380","785960"," And then above it's 4.11.40, 4.11.70, right about"
"785960","786300"," there."
"786900","787860"," There's no one to give that up."
"787860","799330"," If they do give that up right there, 4.13,"
"799970","802090"," 12 right up in here. "
"804250","805690"," Something like that, right?"
"808850","810630"," Try to make that maybe a red box."
"812570","813630"," Make that a yellow one."
"813730","818250"," Make this one make this one a green one, I guess. "
"819610","821090"," I don't expect much today."
"821090","830310"," I said this yesterday that I didn't expect too much like crazy movement this morning."
"830590","833910"," This is more positioning for range expansion down the road. "
"836490","839050"," And well, let's just look back on."
"846290","848510"," I'm not saying we're going straight up like this."
"851650","855550"," But even if we're just going to, even if we're just going to have a, let's say we can even"
"855550","859590"," look back in time here, we can go back on another fucking 1970s or something. "
"862490","864390"," Probably need to go on SPX, so not spy."
"868130","871810"," And we'll go, we'll go, let me see if we can get, I don't know how far back I can"
"871810","872090"," go on."
"872150","872830"," Oh, that's SP. "
"873010","873310"," I need SPX."
"874910","876370"," I don't know if this chart will do it."
"877410","884970"," But I mean, even if we're not going up like crazy bull market crazy, you didn't get all the way"
"884970","886310"," back there to the 70s or whatever. "
"891550","892770"," Let's go to the 70s."
"896030","896710"," Go on here."
"899550","901010"," Maybe the 50s or 60s. "
"901510","903290"," I don't know if this chart's not even showing it."
"904630","906070"," But anyways, it doesn't really matter."
"906350","908810"," Point being is, yeah, we do always go up, don't we?"
"909330","913390"," But every month, the point being here is if we're in kind of any kind of bull trend, you should"
"913390","915870"," have some kind of a monthly trend as my point. "
"916450","917670"," Probably the bad, bad example."
"918530","925410"," And but my point being here is you should have some kind of a monthly trend here."
"925750","931230"," And if we look back on October, you know, the market goes up in the market. "
"931430","933770"," I'm trying to make a simple comparison here, okay?"
"934270","935690"," Where it goes up, it comes down."
"936290","938830"," Market goes up, it comes down, right?"
"939890","942210"," Market consolidates a little bit goes up, right?"
"942450","948110"," So when it comes back down, market comes up and it starts to consolidate a little bit, right?"
"948290","953030"," So you kind of get a minimum, you're going to kind of expect some consolidation, right?"
"953190","955890"," Does that make sense to if you're a bull out there."
"957690","959570"," Now, can we squeeze higher from here?"
"959630","959830"," Sure. "
"960130","961530"," I mean, it's not that we can't."
"962010","964370"," I know you guys like to fucking draw."
"964370","966090"," Now you guys care. "
"966570","968630"," Well, just we'll just keep it on SPX."
"969250","976750"," I know you guys like to draw shit and you're like, you know, you're like, here, we got to get"
"976750","978690"," a bull flag right here, though, cap, what are we going to do?"
"979790","981210"," And yeah, this would be invalidated."
"981510","990390"," I mean, if you if you want to be like, I don't know, if you want to draw something, you"
"993820","995920"," want to be like, yeah, that's a that's a bull flag cap. "
"996060","1000200"," As long as you stay up here, we're gonna we're gonna blast off North up here."
"1000400","1006220"," But the truth is, um, it was just like we talked about, right?"
"1006640","1009020"," We walked into Friday, not Friday."
"1009220","1017980"," We went into, uh, we walked into CPI and, uh, you know, we walked in, we literally traded up into"
"1017980","1022380"," it and zero dates on the clothes were $4. "
"1023260","1028460"," You're not fucking paying you $12 fucking zero dates and they opened the next day fucking crazy."
"1028460","1029859"," We thought they were doing that for you."
"1030280","1035020"," And if you really thought they were doing that for you, I don't know what to say to you. "
"1036200","1037520"," They just weren't going to do that."
"1037660","1041960"," So, can we trade up here and squeeze it higher?"
"1042280","1042359"," Sure."
"1042680","1047319"," But, um, truth is, you know, we're up here, we got to kick ass high. "
"1047500","1048300"," We got to kick ass high."
"1048440","1049280"," We got to kick ass high."
"1050340","1055180"," You know, team kick ass and, you know, we got 402404 down here. "
"1056220","1057860"," Um, that's not even velocity."
"1058180","1059900"," That's not even a downward move, believe it or not."
"1059980","1061480"," Like I'm, I'm like, give me 396. "
"1062180","1063040"," This is nothing."
"1063060","1070220"," So, uh, to see something like this or to prepare for something like this, we could squeeze higher"
"1070220","1074160"," today, squeeze up to four, 12, something like that for 14."
"1075160","1082340"," But, you know, the job of you being a bull right now is to look for a dip to buy. "
"1083300","1089120"," So, if you're looking for a dip to buy and we're not holding above here, we remember yesterday when"
"1089120","1093700"," we were, so we're live stream yesterday and I said, well, we're bullish here."
"1093900","1094860"," Like, I think we're heading to close."
"1095060","1095860"," I'm like, I'm bullish here. "
"1096660","1098320"," Uh, but the sellers are up there, right?"
"1099220","1102640"," Uh, so yesterday I'd said, do you see how we're squeezing higher?"
"1103660","1104860"," Uh, we're not seeing normal."
"1105580","1109880"," Uh, so remember yesterday we're doing this and I was like, notice how we're squeezing, it's just"
"1109880","1113200"," not a normal buying pattern all the way up, right?"
"1113960","1116060"," Oh, hold on a second here, we make it better for you."
"1116300","1123460"," So, it wasn't a normal, like, like we go up, comes back down, consolidates, we go up, comes back"
"1123460","1126220"," down, consolidates the supportive, supportive, right?"
"1127080","1131280"," So, we can buy a dip and we go up normally, buy a dip, go up normally, buy a dip,"
"1131440","1131860"," go up normally. "
"1132340","1133300"," So, we're not seeing that yesterday."
"1133500","1134120"," We're seeing squeezing."
"1134580","1138720"," So, when you're seeing squeezing, that means that there's selling pressure down here, right?"
"1139020","1140660"," There's selling pressure down here. "
"1140660","1142220"," There's selling pressure right here."
"1142580","1144940"," Then we squeeze higher, squeeze higher, squeeze higher."
"1145000","1148800"," So, it's indicative of sellers entering the market, right?"
"1148940","1152360"," It's easy way to see that their sellers entering the market. "
"1152840","1157480"," Now, the other thing that I told you yesterday was we had to hold 412-32 and as long as"
"1157480","1159700"," we know that there's strong buyers here, I'm bullish, right?"
"1159900","1164400"," And the moment we traded underneath it and into the close yesterday, you can see that those buyers"
"1164400","1165400"," have removed their support."
"1166320","1169860"," We know the next round of buyers is down below here, right?"
"1169980","1171200"," They came in, stepped in yesterday."
"1171500","1173760"," See that green box, right?"
"1173960","1178000"," This is the next known zone of buyers, 408-49. "
"1178680","1182040"," The options market is priced in down here."
"1182500","1184060"," So, yesterday, we knew there were buyers here."
"1184660","1188480"," Yesterday, we knew they came up from where I was like, oh, they're coming up right now, right?"
"1188820","1193660"," And we know that they removed their support yesterday around 4 o'clock, 14 in the afternoon. "
"1194300","1198000"," So, we know that down here, or we expect that down here, the buyers are down here right now."
"1198800","1200420"," But currently, I don't see them there."
"1200660","1206380"," Currently, I don't see the buyers from yesterday down below under the spy. "
"1206760","1210200"," So, when I'm looking at the support for the spy, I'm not seeing it."
"1210700","1214720"," So, when I told you yesterday, hey, the buyers are here, but right now, they're not."
"1215000","1219260"," So, currently, we have sellers above. "
"1219600","1222120"," We've got sellers on the one minute, the hourly and the daily."
"1223140","1224300"," So, we're below."
"1224540","1225700"," This is where the support was yesterday. "
"1226880","1231540"," This is where the buyers were yesterday as well, excuse me, yesterday at, sorry, wrong place."
"1232480","1234720"," Right here, right here, right?"
"1234900","1235060"," See it?"
"1235240","1236920"," Four, this is two o'clock in the afternoon."
"1237060","1237720"," This is where the buyers were. "
"1238320","1239540"," Buyers, you guys can't see that."
"1240200","1244520"," Buyers were here, buyers were here, and then buyers were here, and we lost the buyers."
"1245040","1247860"," So, now the buyers have become sellers, right?"
"1248120","1249500"," So, they're above us right now. "
"1250440","1252640"," And so, you just want to pay attention to that, right?"
"1252960","1257620"," So, any kind of moves higher, would likely be squeezers, or squeezing, right?"
"1257740","1261060"," Just get some squeezing higher, and the buyers will step back in and try to sell this down."
"1262200","1264240"," So, can the, can the buyers lose here?"
"1264360","1264600"," Sure."
"1264820","1272480"," Fairs can lose above 4.1132. Fairs can lose right above here, 4.1132. Let me see if I get"
"1272480","1272800"," this right. "
"1273960","1276160"," 4.1132, and why I put that up so high."
"1278160","1279040"," They're right here."
"1279900","1281600"," So, this is because it's where the options market is. "
"1282480","1282880"," My bad."
"1287470","1289010"," That's that 4.13 or something."
"1289270","1290270"," As a matter of fact, this is coming down. "
"1290950","1294570"," You can actually, I can actually, watching right now, call sellers entering the market in the"
"1294570","1294790"," background."
"1295350","1298290"," So, actually, your ceiling is lowering right now."
"1298710","1303230"," Just so you know, this, this implied move today is coming down. "
"1303410","1305190"," It's on the, it's moving down right now."
"1306150","1310790"," But just so you can see, the buyers became sellers yesterday."
"1311170","1314150"," They're above here right now, trying to hold this market. "
"1314510","1316790"," And actually, this, this number is coming down, too."
"1317130","1319610"," So, 4.1130, somewhere right in here."
"1320410","1322950"," There are sellers here just waiting to sell down on you. "
"1323450","1324960"," I'm going to be a warning now, if you're a bull."
"1325840","1329420"," Well, I'm not giving you a warning that it's going to be a bloodbath, but I'm going to warn you"
"1329420","1332320"," that there are sellers here, right?"
"1332760","1335340"," The buy, the support that was here yesterday is now gone."
"1335900","1339060"," You've got sellers waiting above here, and you've got sellers waiting above here. "
"1340160","1341360"," Now, can we squeeze higher?"
"1341620","1342180"," Yes, we can."
"1343120","1348580"," But just know that we're at the top of a key right here, you know, we're getting to that point."
"1348900","1355060"," So, if you've got people on fin to it telling screaming bloody murder that, I don't know, we're"
"1355060","1360840"," going to 4.30 today, just in the normal, the normal cycles of things, right?"
"1361140","1362940"," A monthly OPEC's you guys know what that is. "
"1365040","1366000"," We should go down."
"1366260","1367300"," How far down do we go?"
"1368620","1370160"," I don't see it being too crazy."
"1370280","1372220"," I don't, I don't see it being too crazy. "
"1372300","1379820"," I think the, the real bottom is somewhere around, for the, the dip I'd like to buy is, I told"
"1379820","1381680"," you where that was, right, right down here."
"1382420","1383400"," That's what I'd like to buy."
"1384100","1390400"," I don't know how long it takes if it takes to the 19th or 20th, for if it takes into"
"1390400","1392940"," the start of the start of the month of March. "
"1394140","1395700"," But I'd really like to buy this down here."
"1396560","1399400"," So, do I think we get down here to this low?"
"1400260","1401220"," I don't know."
"1402060","1404200"," I'll be honest, I don't know. "
"1404200","1404660"," I feel I'll be happy."
"1406940","1410700"," I think it's like 4.02, 405 tomorrow, something like that, or the weekend."
"1414110","1418470"," Something like that, if we can get some kind of rejection, sell down into the weekend, Bloodbath"
"1418470","1424870"," and Friday, trade it back up and see maybe 396 and then the month, and then that makes it a"
"1424870","1426270"," viable dip for March. "
"1427250","1427890"," I'd be happy."
"1428370","1434650"," The other thing to consider too is the end of March, they want to keep us under 4060, I believe."
"1435430","1436490"," Keep that in mind. "
"1436850","1445850"," So, I want you to realize that JPM wants us under 4060 or something on SPX somewhere in here."
"1446930","1452310"," So, you know, if you start seeing something like that, maybe we get some Bloodbath thing and then"
"1452310","1459150"," we trade above the 406 and then March, and then just under by the 31st, seems logical."
"1462630","1463790"," Can we close with that?"
"1463950","1467350"," Yeah, but just know there's a magnet there for March 31st. "
"1467790","1470130"," And we're about halfway through the quarter, right?"
"1470310","1472530"," We're almost halfway through the quarter right now."
"1473690","1474770"," Bull's did a great job."
"1475050","1479090"," So, just plan on that for the next month and a half. "
"1479990","1484590"," They probably have a downward move, probably have an upward move to get us back to a pin."
"1485190","1487950"," Of at least 4060 and SPX."
"1488410","1491750"," Usually, overshoot these things a little bit and then they work their way back to it. "
"1493870","1495470"," I'm not going to expect much today."
"1495590","1496250"," I'll be honest with you."
"1496370","1497830"," I'm not going to expect much price action. "
"1498810","1501350"," The market's not set up for it today."
"1502830","1504230"," Pretty much price action."
"1508720","1510660"," So far, that's proved itself, right?"
"1510940","1514260"," Remember yesterday I said to you, I was like, you guys probably just take that trade. "
"1514460","1518640"," Like you're not going to see much action today."
"1518760","1524120"," And if anything, you could probably, for the day today, make this a viable bottom down here and"
"1524120","1528280"," there's something to sell for today, right?"
"1528560","1530460"," Like buying down here, selling up here."
"1531420","1533300"," I wouldn't expect too much of it. "
"1536060","1538560"," Of the day, I'm not expecting too much to happen today."
"1543910","1545270"," Good morning, Jay Cortina."
"1545450","1546770"," Good morning, Victor Ostrum. "
"1546830","1547470"," Good morning, Red Pit."
"1547730","1547850"," R."
"1547950","1548030"," S."
"1548170","1548410"," Good morning."
"1548690","1549510"," Prushi, Brian. "
"1550370","1551530"," Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh."
"1552170","1552990"," Stocks on us."
"1552990","1553410"," Good morning. "
"1553510","1553830"," How are you?"
"1554150","1555070"," Matt Phillip, how are you?"
"1555990","1556530"," Day John."
"1556790","1557110"," Good morning."
"1558270","1559830"," Tank Adams, Mount Beva. "
"1560730","1561410"," Jason Hendricks."
"1561690","1561910"," Good morning."
"1562910","1566090"," One good thing too is, let me just one quick second here. "
"1588320","1588980"," Oh, shit."
"1591800","1599020"," One good thing too is that we're not, we're not getting price velocity on Brett."
"1599420","1600980"," So we'll look at that too this morning. "
"1601340","1601720"," We'll look at Brett."
"1602240","1603320"," Morning, Jason, how are you, man?"
"1603660","1611900"," Liam, Nino, Griff, Wow, Deb Pegg, Garrett, Cosness, Dean, Al, Marina."
"1612180","1612540"," How are you, man?"
"1612840","1613340"," Good to see you, brother. "
"1614920","1615640"," Flama Blanca."
"1615720","1616160"," Good to see you."
"1616280","1616540"," H bomb. "
"1616820","1617080"," Good morning."
"1617260","1617340"," Omar."
"1617660","1617940"," Good morning. "
"1618180","1618720"," Everybody's in here."
"1618720","1619260"," This morning, huh?"
"1619800","1620720"," Jorge, Val, what up?"
"1623960","1625380"," When do you zero dates in spy?"
"1625920","1626680"," What do you use?"
"1628420","1629340"," Yeah, it's a good question."
"1629620","1632260"," So, as a matter of fact, we can just grab a question this morning for all you guys. "
"1633200","1639380"," What tool, explain the tools that you use out there in the chat."
"1640300","1641260"," Let us know what you use."
"1641480","1651220"," You trade SPX for the tax benefits and the options, contracts"
"1651220","1654360"," for spy zero dates. "
"1654980","1662220"," Do you use this program for trading other tickers or just market awareness while you're trading"
"1662220","1664040"," stocks maybe?"
"1665880","1670000"," What do you use this program for and what what instruments do you use?"
"1670940","1671540"," Good question, Winky."
"1672400","1675740"," Could be wise, up 7% right on Omar."
"1676240","1677660"," I haven't been able to buy this morning. "
"1681850","1684870"," I use hotkeys and no stops glued to price action."
"1685790","1687890"," I diamond hand every time he has a hilarious."
"1694860","1703540"," Yeah, I stop it if I stop out of friend stops reverse just the pennies valve of the printer means"
"1703540","1703900"," attack. "
"1704540","1706040"," I don't let go upside down."
"1706580","1708120"," I'm happy with 10, 20, 40%."
"1708120","1716720"," Okay, so I want you guys to pay attention to something here. "
"1719700","1720620"," Pay attention closer."
"1720900","1724200"," Okay, if you're trading, where's the EMA at right now?"
"1724600","1725720"," I changed the EMA yesterday."
"1725720","1730000"," I'm a bad, make this like 1.13 or something today. "
"1732260","1735600"," Okay, so if you guys are trading zero dates, right?"
"1738780","1748500"," You're one of your key things here is the white and red is going to be like waiting"
"1748500","1749640"," for confirmation."
"1749840","1752060"," So let's look at this one right here right now."
"1753080","1754160"," Just set up right here. "
"1754840","1756840"," You know, you're not going to be able to take every single setup."
"1756840","1763100"," But what you're looking for here is like you might miss this."
"1764840","1766540"," You might miss this trade right here. "
"1766700","1775900"," The truth is you want to you want to trade you want to take the trade you want to take"
"1775900","1781000"," you want to take the trade that comes down and reacts off the white and red."
"1781500","1782620"," It's like right here."
"1784280","1789420"," You take a in the money or is up to a 30 delta zero date. "
"1790600","1791040"," Right?"
"1791300","1799000"," If it reacts and holds the one minute, then you hold it to the next price target here and you"
"1799000","1800600"," take the money as you get there."
"1801660","1804800"," When it comes back and reacts to one minute, you try to jump back in again."
"1805260","1809480"," Another key point here would be to check this. "
"1809860","1818300"," I'll oftentimes switch to the five minute chart and right now on the five minute chart, we're not"
"1818300","1820060"," getting C."
"1820380","1820920"," I'll show you this."
"1823460","1825880"," See how the five minute chart has got the white below red here."
"1826960","1833740"," So if you look here, see how white's above red on the five minute, you see here, we had a"
"1833740","1843640"," trend day and see how in so on a one minute it"
"1843640","1844640"," looks bullish, right?"
"1847660","1849440"," This kind of looks bullish here, right?"
"1849560","1853780"," But it's not actually bullish, believe it or not. "
"1853980","1858560"," So if you run a five minute and you want to see if we were in trend day, you go"
"1858560","1860820"," to five minute and you'd want to see this white line above."
"1862880","1864100"," Let me see if I can get this here."
"1872940","1878960"," You actually want to see this white line crossing above and this red line crossing under. "
"1879360","1879820"," Damn it."
"1883410","1889830"," You want to see this red line crossing over and then you'd want to see price above right here."
"1890690","1892970"," And that would be your signal to go. "
"1899970","1901770"," Like, hey, I bought this and I'm going there."
"1902510","1904650"," So I'm not seeing it here on this."
"1905210","1907290"," So I'm not taking a call right here. "
"1907350","1907950"," So it's five minutes."
"1908830","1910250"," Put them back to the one minute."
"1910950","1915390"," You might be like, yeah, maybe I take this trade here and see if this goes higher for the five"
"1915390","1917410"," minute just is just proving it right now, right?"
"1923600","1924440"," Does that make sense?"
"1927890","1931770"," If the trade goes against you, we're going to have one other thing here too. "
"1932050","1939270"," So on a five minute here, I'm going to bring you back to the five minute really quick and show"
"1939270","1939590"," you this."
"1943540","1944820"," They're five minute chart, right?"
"1948050","1951170"," Price stayed above, right?"
"1951390","1952310"," Broke below here."
"1953350","1957370"," This is when you take your money and run, right?"
"1959070","1960150"," Price broke above again. "
"1960650","1964790"," Now if you're just buying calls, I don't particularly like buying puts on the spot."
"1965770","1970310"," If this was SPX would be different or ES would be different, but there'd be a different thing that"
"1970310","1970590"," you would do."
"1970690","1976850"," But anyways, you could take this trade again, quick squeeze, right?"
"1977290","1981270"," Quick squeeze was still trading above the five minute white line. "
"1983530","1985230"," So here's where things get fascinating."
"1986790","1992710"," If you're on this five minute, this white line right here, right?"
"1992950","1996470"," The moment you come back down here and validate your trade, you got to stop loss here, right?"
"1996670","1997770"," You're always watching this for a stop."
"1997990","2002010"," But the key here is watch how it breaks below the five minute white line. "
"2002770","2004530"," And then it comes back up and rejects."
"2005110","2009170"," That's how you know right there that you've got the put side of that trade right there."
"2010130","2014150"," Now this trade here, you would have missed, but see how you get the second rejection?"
"2014750","2017970"," Boom, you could have taken that one right there and you're underneath it, right?"
"2019970","2022870"," But I don't, I don't trade puts on the spy. "
"2023350","2025550"," I don't like how they don't, they don't, they don't print a ton."
"2026490","2029530"," Personally, I don't, I don't, I don't like to start, they're not built."
"2029870","2030530"," They weren't created. "
"2031530","2033450"," They're created as a hedge not to make money."
"2034090","2038170"," Calls were, believe it or not, technically created to make money."
"2038690","2039410"," Puts were not. "
"2039810","2042370"," Did you guys all know that there weren't puts in the market at one time?"
"2045210","2046870"," Some of you know that, but some of you don't."
"2048230","2049230"," We started with stocks."
"2051929","2054670"," Then we had calls, we didn't have put, you can only buy calls. "
"2055810","2060989"," And then when they created puts as a hedging tool, not as a, we're selling the market tool."
"2061270","2062070"," This is a hedging tool."
"2062570","2066770"," So the mechanics of them, they do print, but you need big moves for them to print. "
"2068670","2073670"," So right now in this five minute chart, what does this look like to you, right?"
"2073790","2077530"," Let's just look at a five minute chart right here, right?"
"2077690","2082330"," If white is over, over red, are we bullish or we bearish?"
"2083670","2084710"," We're bullish, right?"
"2085730","2086270"," Pretty simple."
"2087150","2088130"," Not rocket science."
"2088570","2088949"," Do you want to see it?"
"2089610","2090250"," White over red. "
"2090949","2091330"," What are we?"
"2091790","2092090"," Bullish."
"2093250","2094350"," Fairly simple, right?"
"2095230","2095810"," White over red."
"2096730","2097570"," We're bullish, right?"
"2098790","2099690"," White under red. "
"2099810","2100170"," What are we?"
"2101310","2102070"," Easy, right?"
"2103210","2104130"," It's like crayons, right?"
"2105350","2107990"," For bearish, bearish, or sideways."
"2107990","2110230"," See sideways, right?"
"2110410","2110990"," Paris, right?"
"2111430","2112610"," Paris, bares, bares, right?"
"2113090","2113770"," White over red."
"2113830","2114190"," What are we?"
"2114610","2116830"," Bullish, fairly simple, right?"
"2117090","2117530"," White over red. "
"2117830","2118170"," Bullish."
"2119130","2120070"," White over red."
"2120230","2120730"," Bullish, right?"
"2120970","2121430"," White over red. "
"2121550","2124070"," Still kind of bullish in sideways, right?"
"2125270","2125670"," White over red."
"2125810","2126050"," Bullish."
"2126650","2127070"," White under red. "
"2127170","2127510"," What are we?"
"2127790","2130870"," Paris, right?"
"2131490","2132930"," Over here, blast down to support."
"2133690","2135190"," Still bearish with the white under the red, right?"
"2135190","2135270"," right?"
"2135910","2138010"," So right now, what are we?"
"2138490","2139350"," Today, what are we?"
"2141350","2142270"," Let's have a look at today."
"2144210","2145250"," What are you right now?"
"2146350","2146790"," Bears. "
"2148290","2148730"," Right?"
"2149070","2150730"," So do you take the call right here?"
"2151030","2151230"," No."
"2152250","2153290"," It's risky, right?"
"2154350","2155270"," Very risky, right?"
"2155390","2159190"," This is where the bears will key off on us, try to sell us down, right?"
"2159770","2160670"," Try to sell us down."
"2161690","2162850"," So what are you looking for?"
"2163510","2168230"," Looking for this white line to cross above, right?"
"2168450","2169010"," You want to look at this?"
"2169210","2171950"," Hold on, hold on. "
"2172070","2175490"," Okay, let's see if this white line to cross up."
"2178210","2180590"," And you're looking for this red line to cross down, David."
"2184370","2185870"," White line to cross down right here. "
"2189050","2191130"," And you're looking for prices to get above it, right?"
"2193450","2194490"," Price to get above it."
"2194790","2199630"," And when you go to take that trade, you have some targets above."
"2199890","2203950"," You've got 4.12.08, you've got 4.12.41, you know, the sellers are here. "
"2204570","2205130"," Oh, damn it."
"2207030","2213800"," So we set this up every morning to see where we are, right?"
"2214060","2215860"," So this looks bullish just fuck right here, doesn't it?"
"2216040","2218440"," On the one that looks bullish, it has a motherfucker."
"2219000","2220740"," So normally you'll be like, yeah, I'm taking that trade long. "
"2221540","2223140"," But then a second check."
"2223540","2225440"," And it doesn't look so bullish anymore, does it?"
"2226460","2227520"," Now, can it become bullish?"
"2228080","2228080"," Sure."
"2228580","2229600"," Would I take this trade?"
"2230280","2231960"," No, it doesn't meet my rules, does it?"
"2232680","2233760"," This doesn't meet my rules. "
"2234140","2236320"," I want this white line above this red line, don't I?"
"2237580","2240860"," Why do I want to fuck around with this noise right here?"
"2242220","2244540"," Why would I want to fuck around with that noise right there?"
"2245040","2246000"," Let me scale a little bit."
"2246420","2251620"," Why would I want to fuck around with this when I can fuck around with all this right here."
"2251620","2252300"," You see that?"
"2252820","2260940"," For this little tiny win right here, little tiny win, I'm going to risk this bullshit here for all"
"2260940","2262720"," this fucking awesomeness right here. "
"2262860","2263520"," Does that make sense?"
"2264780","2266600"," So all this noise, see the cross right here?"
"2268620","2270300"," Get across to the white over the red."
"2270640","2271920"," Too much work that took."
"2272600","2276760"," Once that confirms though, if that shit's on like Donkey Kong, right?"
"2276760","2277280"," Boom. "
"2278340","2279180"," That's all I need."
"2279480","2281840"," I don't need all this nonsense noise down here."
"2282060","2284580"," So if you're a bull, what are you waiting for?"
"2285140","2287460"," You're waiting for this to play itself out. "
"2288340","2292860"," You're waiting for this white line to come up and cross this red line."
"2293240","2294260"," If you're a bull, that's what you're looking for."
"2294380","2298960"," For this white line to come up, red line to come down and jump on the trade and go up. "
"2299800","2303300"," You can switch to a one minute chart at that point."
"2304200","2305520"," And then you know you're off and running."
"2306420","2307720"," So right now it looks bullish right?"
"2310620","2311620"," Looks super bullish. "
"2312500","2314220"," You're going to make five bucks or something like that."
"2314820","2316580"," A hundred bucks or something, maybe a quick hundred percent trade."
"2318280","2319580"," Crank this up, make some money. "
"2319800","2323280"," But the truth is, this isn't that bullish."
"2323780","2325100"," It's not as bullish as you think it is."
"2328090","2328490"," Okay. "
"2328970","2333370"," If you want this to get become bullish, you more than likely want to see this right?"
"2333810","2338370"," You want to see you want to see this white line cross above."
"2339270","2340510"," You want to start talking bullish?"
"2341450","2346990"," You want to see you want to see this line come down?"
"2347590","2348770"," You want to see this line come up?"
"2353810","2359810"," And you want to then go on social media and say, for bullish right here."
"2360310","2360670"," Makes sense?"
"2364510","2366090"," And you can say this. "
"2366350","2371770"," You can actually say this and know that people that say, no, we aren't are wrong."
"2372190","2373570"," You can say, I know they're wrong."
"2374230","2377670"," You know, my price targets are above all that kind of stuff. "
"2380190","2381650"," And he'll tell you that you're wrong."
"2382770","2385970"," You can you can know that they have no fucking idea what they're talking about."
"2387050","2387490"," Okay. "
"2388210","2389550"," Right now, this is a volatility."
"2390670","2392310"," This is some horse trade going on."
"2393590","2395430"," And I don't trust any of this. "
"2396130","2397330"," We can squeeze here."
"2397450","2399330"," We can squeeze up and squeeze right to there."
"2399330","2402970"," If we want if they want to go big deal, still bearish. "
"2404350","2405770"," Or at least sideways."
"2407830","2409510"," And there's where the change was right there."
"2410310","2411350"," You can actually see right here. "
"2412170","2414230"," Right in the close, right?"
"2414630","2414770"," Bullish."
"2416850","2419010"," Crossed under, bearish."
"2420130","2420610"," Makes sense?"
"2427440","2427840"," Bullish?"
"2428460","2428980"," Well, not even bullish. "
"2429180","2429780"," We're even bullish here."
"2430540","2433080"," So when we're squeezing here yesterday, I told you we're not bullish here."
"2433180","2433620"," We're just squeezing. "
"2434320","2437520"," And then yesterday, we had some supportive action down here."
"2437520","2438620"," And I said, I'm bullish again."
"2439680","2442660"," And this morning, I'm like, oh, starting to get bearish again. "
"2443500","2447380"," And even right now, even though we're squeezing, I'm still bearish."
"2447700","2452700"," I need to see this white line cross above for me to become bullish again."
"2454800","2456440"," So we're squeezing right now. "
"2456540","2457360"," That's what's happening."
"2458200","2459860"," And we're just squeezing at this moment."
"2460120","2461000"," Still bearish stance. "
"2462860","2463400"," Makes sense?"
"2465280","2466840"," This looks pretty fucking bullish, right?"
"2467280","2470080"," So if you're like a trader and wherever you're like, yeah, this is super bullish cap."
"2470620","2472100"," I think you can make money here and all that."
"2472200","2473820"," I think we can squeeze here, squeeze up here. "
"2474600","2478520"," But my stance is still bearish at this point, even with the squeeze."
"2482860","2483720"," Good morning, Winky."
"2483940","2484360"," Good morning, Troy. "
"2484600","2485260"," Good morning, Sweet Owl."

"2544360","2547440"," So if you guys had an important question, we could post that."
"2547600","2548100"," Appreciate it."
"2548220","2548660"," Catch up. "

"2553640","2559160"," Yeah, you can you can follow this on a on a 21 EMA. "
"2559720","2563940"," And right now I've got it set to a 113 EMA, but it changes every day because it's not they're"
"2563940","2564720"," not EMA's."
"2565480","2567360"," They got an app adjusted every day."
"2568400","2574620"," 21, 27, 113, 176, 186, 200, depends on the day. "
"2576760","2581580"," Because this I can't run a program on this charting on this chart here."
"2581580","2586060"," I can't run a program in the background with the fractals on it."
"2587180","2590500"," What fractals, but I can't do LA wave fractals on this chart. "
"2590760","2593240"," So changes every day."
"2593680","2596340"," You guys are getting a tool at some point so you can have this exact every day."
"2597940","2598960"," But this works. "
"2599480","2605720"," So like you want it to you want it to to a ham kiss or something like that."
"2608780","2609380"," It works."
"2609640","2612100"," It works well enough for a weevil chart. "
"2618410","2619470"," Tell the morning to you Doug."

"2895410","2902390"," trader out it's not about there's that there's kind of two ways this goes I think I think I think"

"2934950","2939810"," trying to pass down knowledge over the years people like that but then you get people that are like"
"2939810","2945390"," they see new investors traders coming out of the market they know they can make money off them"
"2945390","2951270"," because it's always new new investors and traders and then you got people like me I just I trade"
"2951270","2955970"," and you know you get on the rabbit hole and then you start getting wrapped up into it and then"
"2955970","2961950"," that's consuming all my life right I don't charge anything this kind of this cost me at this point"
"2961950","2971770"," I don't know 50 60 $70,000 or something and then a ton of time like two"
"2971770","2978110"," years of time and so it's just at a point where NASA has to become something that's self-sufficient"
"2978110","2985450"," runs on its own and then the tools cost money the data for it costs five to $15,000 a"

"2997950","3004190"," table or anything like that just the data should cost money so before we just shut it all down so"
"3004190","3008890"," and I think that's the choice is I think that's the choice is we just shut it all down it"

"5052170","5060550"," the trade get above 2074 you want to see the one minute catch up for at least one more push"
"5060550","5064950"," up but the best would be you see how this is how this is leveling off here and this is"
"5064950","5070710"," leveling up it makes me think that the trade is over so currently I think that GME trade is over"
"5070710","5077350"," but if you don't or if you want to sell this the better thing to say would be if there's"
"5077350","5086430"," a failure of 2074 there's a retest failure of 2074 price target down below 2010 and 1990"

"6839860","6849540"," going to be 99 61 then below that is 105 bucks now with all this"
"6849540","6857550"," said with all that said you see the rejection that's already happening here"
"6857550","6865110"," and you already see the pin strike down below you need to have this momentum come up from"
"6865110","6871130"," underneath and carry it over so you're you're a profit taker here and it's more than likely gonna"
"6871130","6878250"," take some time some consolidation for Google to get pushed above consolidates and then make its leg"
"6878250","6887250"," higher so you can snap that right there the trade is over if you break below and hold below 94"

"6942920","6947780"," you can you can wait for because what will happen is if we could if we trade below one minute"
"6947780","6952680"," it'll come back down it'll hopefully try to consolidate and then you need the one minute to come"
"6952680","6959260"," back down and grab it again so I'd be interested if 492 breaks to be interested down here at 478"
"6959260","6965480"," 472 you want to be watching it to see if it consolidates if it breaks below so you're looking for"

"7021750","7033470"," above nailed it we're gonna look at one second-air as far"
"7033470","7049870"," as settings task view just one second here just"
"7049870","7061290"," a second here okay"
"7061290","7081250"," so there's a rejection on spy trade it all the way up to the top of the key next price"
"7081250","7095310"," target on spy is 413 we got"
"7095310","7104770"," 4 we got 4 12 86 right next one would be 413 47"
"7108520","7118300"," right there 4 12"
"7118300","7130600"," 86 right here right there on the"
"7130600","7135780"," spy we'll go to the five-minute chart and you see the cross over right now in the five minute"
"7135780","7143040"," off and run you're gonna be looking for possibly a pullback to 411 53 unless it consolidates right"
"7143040","7150800"," here so 411 it's right 411 53"
"7150800","7160350"," right here"
"7160350","7180530"," and next"
"7184210","7192970"," target above 413 right 413 30"
"7192970","7225460"," now we're"
"7225460","7231240"," bullish on spy pause the program go back pause the program and go back and you can watch what I"
"7231240","7238140"," said to you about spy back here this is where we're bullish on spy back here before I started doing"
"7238140","7244180"," charting I told you were bullish here going up to 4 12 86 price target was hit I'm gonna look"
"7244180","7253100"," for two things I'm gonna look for consolidation and move higher to 413 30 or a pullback down below"
"7253100","7266890"," to the one minute that's 4 12 20 likely pull back to 411 53 for the dip-5 yeah"
"7281710","7296240"," right there there's your one minute trigger right here yeah"
"7296240","7301700"," don't worry about it you can see it on a five minute here before I start charting we were on"
"7301700","7308860"," the five minute and right here and we traded above this red line right here you can see the retest"
"7308860","7317200"," down below we traded to 411 I gave you the target of 4 12 86 up here 4 12 86"
"7317200","7323880"," you should get a target target hit right there next target above the 413 30 and you can see right"
"7323880","7330500"," now the one minute momentum is coming higher see it coming up right here it's tracking higher and"
"7330500","7340470"," higher and higher I'll just get rid"
"7340470","7353940"," of some right for 4 12 86 so 4 12 86 there and"
"7366510","7375230"," 413 30 above yes there is"
"7375230","7380870"," so I've got a post why I haven't hanging in the wrong place it was supposed to be on a"

"11496810","11501670"," not just trying to shake me out but i'm not i'm also just trying to fight sellers i'm also trying"
"11501670","11507490"," to fight theta as the day moves on right so i bought this dip down below here i could have"
"11507490","11513330"," taken profit up here right take the money up the table 70 cents i'm actually in right now and"
"11513330","11518570"," mostly because i want to show you guys but um right now you see they're trying to sell this down"

"11590390","11597150"," matter to me okay so right in here so right in here right you're only good for the move so"
"11597150","11603790"," when you see me trade zero dates here i'll trade this leg up i'll take the money i look back"

"14051080","14051680"," Okay, Chase. "
"14053040","14053360"," Chase."
"14055720","14056980"," What's the trade from here, Chase?"
"14061480","14062840"," What's the trade from right here, bro?"
"14099120","14101580"," All right, so what do we want to do here?"
"14101700","14102360"," We want to hold."
"14103460","14105700"," We want to hold for 12. "
"14106240","14107680"," I don't know if we hold this or not."
"14107680","14108520"," Take the money and run."
"14109260","14111800"," We want to do and have a recheck down below, right?"
"14112060","14112620"," We want to. "
"14112720","14116600"," I don't know if we'll get it, but we do want to see if there's a recheck down below."
"14116700","14122000"," That would be that we come back down and check the one minute for a move higher."
"14122000","14124000"," Believe it or not, there's a higher, higher move. "
"14124660","14126240"," So we close the closes."
"14126240","14131400"," So right now at this point, we've closed the gap from the gap is closed from yesterday."
"14131520","14134580"," Okay, now we know the sellers stepped in slightly before. "
"14135360","14138120"," We know that day traders stepped out of the market, right?"
"14138300","14142220"," I turned the matter of fact, I turned the broadcast off yesterday and the fucking market took a"
"14142220","14142900"," nose dive, right?"
"14144040","14149160"," So we want to see if those if this so were these actual sellers above or were these just day"
"14149160","14156480"," traders getting out of with these algorithms getting out where these big banks getting out, that"
"14156480","14156980"," kind of stuff."
"14157500","14162260"," Now, when you want to be blaming, you're trying to blame like zero day craze on day traders, you"
"14162260","14162640"," can't."
"14163040","14164300"," This isn't day traders. "
"14164780","14166720"," This is algorithms from large banks."
"14167660","14170780"," Okay, and because we trade with them, we know where it's going."
"14171280","14173120"," We just follow their coattails, right?"
"14173280","14179500"," We're at the ones buying 390,000 calls in the money calls at fucking 11 in the afternoon. "
"14179500","14180260"," It's not us."
"14182120","14185740"," Sorry, it's we're not spending 300 million dollars in this, this stream."
"14186240","14189800"," But we are following those motherfuckers as they trade this market, right?"
"14190040","14191400"," And pin this mark and push to mark it up. "
"14191980","14195540"," So this is what we're doing here, right?"
"14195680","14196740"," As we're trying to follow these guys."
"14196820","14201060"," So we want to see if this consolidates here, we'll snap our normal lines and we'll see if these are"
"14201060","14203140"," real sellers early in the day right now."
"14203820","14209060"," And these sellers from yesterday, they're kind of suspect, right?"
"14210360","14216520"," Was this real sellers above here or was this just the algorithms closing out, right?"
"14217140","14223540"," Buying the underlying option and taking the taking their calls out of the market, right?"
"14223760","14225520"," The call gamma out of the market. "
"14225800","14231760"," So, or delta squeeze, right?"
"14232040","14233100"," Delta squeeze in the market."
"14233560","14238960"," So we'll take a look here and see if this cools down a little bit."
"14239040","14241000"," We're going to get rid of this yellow box at this point. "
"14242680","14249120"," And we're going to watch and see the interplay between is this consolidation or not."
"14249580","14251920"," We have a little bit of waning, but it's still bullish."
"14253440","14257740"," See, the white line's not quite like the white line hasn't rolled over, which is what you're"
"14257740","14258160"," looking for. "
"14258200","14261020"," If you're bearish, you're like, you want to see, you feel like I'm bearish here."
"14261900","14269240"," You want to see at least some of this like white line, red line going sideways, right now, not so"
"14269240","14269460"," much."
"14270760","14275080"," So we'll just see was we're waiting to see what the interplay is on the one minute, we're waiting"
"14275080","14277880"," to see what the interplay is on the on the five minute. "
"14278400","14279900"," Just watch this real quick."
"14280360","14281680"," The volume is good here."
"14282420","14284780"," We have sellers here, which is kind of sketchy. "
"14285020","14287940"," We had more buyers step in more buyers step in right here."
"14287940","14292820"," We just had buyers come in and by the underlying right here, right?"
"14293860","14298280"," So we want to make sure that we've got more buyers lined up down below before we take a trip"
"14298280","14298520"," higher."
"14298880","14300200"," We tagged for 13. "
"14300500","14303300"," Well, we tagged it within six cents, right close enough."
"14304600","14306440"," Hang grenades and horse shoes pretty close."
"14306440","14310640"," We know there's we think that the super strong swellers are above here. "
"14310780","14315660"," And we're going to see if we're probably going to get that tag above to 413 80."
"14315960","14321020"," But we want to make sure that that we don't get caught above either, right?"
"14321120","14323320"," We don't get caught up there with our pants down."
"14324400","14327520"," So we're going to watch on here. "
"14327620","14330380"," Let me take a look in the background here and see."
"14331160","14331740"," Yeah, dude."
"14331860","14333360"," H Y G is still bullish here. "
"14333520","14336120"," H Y G is bullish to 74 95."
"14337400","14339140"," So we'll call it like 74 90."
"14339140","14343540"," Okay, price target above on on H Y G 74 90. "
"14344160","14349920"," H Y G needs to stay above currently 74 75."
"14350820","14352580"," I need to stay above 74 75."
"14354300","14355540"," Thank you, Victor, man. "
"14356000","14357540"," Please like and subscribe these videos."
"14357780","14359500"," Show up every day if you want to learn how to trade."
"14360700","14362560"," If you want to know how to time your trades. "
"14362560","14369200"," If you want to know when we get bullish and bearish earlier in this program, I showed you a battle"
"14369200","14371120"," between the bulls and the bears, right?"
"14371620","14375200"," I took a put position earlier and said, okay, I'm in a put position."
"14375460","14376800"," And this is where my stops are."
"14377240","14379020"," And are we getting velocity to the downside?"
"14380120","14383260"," Then when we didn't get velocity to the downside, what did I say to you?"
"14383260","14386480"," I'm going to close my puts here because they're not getting follow through. "
"14386860","14389920"," And now I'm going to look to switch to the bull side of this trade, right?"
"14390500","14391760"," Took the bull side of the trade."
"14391820","14397160"," We knew that the bears didn't have the power and the velocity that they needed to get to new lows."
"14397880","14399560"," And so you saw what happened, right?"
"14400000","14400960"," The bulls won. "
"14401480","14404240"," You saw me not care about the price swinging, right?"
"14404400","14409780"," The violent action that was going on, because I knew that the bears didn't want to give that number"
"14409780","14410120"," up."
"14410440","14413260"," And when they did give that number up, what would be the result?"
"14413800","14416540"," And the result is that we're going to trade much higher."
"14417250","14419600"," And what are we doing right now at this moment?"
"14419880","14421480"," We're trading much higher. "
"14423220","14426320"," Now squeezing higher to 412.90, right?"
"14426560","14428160"," So all these things are lining up."
"14428260","14429320"," But now we've got higher lows."
"14429700","14434720"," We're trying to close out the return to the scene of the crime the day before, right?"
"14434860","14438020"," We're above the one in the five minute on the fucking five minute chart. "
"14438020","14439100"," So we're bullish, right?"
"14439240","14440000"," We're creating separation."
"14440740","14441900"," So we're bullish, right?"
"14442440","14448320"," We're able to switch back and forth between being bullish and bearish and not holding a viewpoint"
"14448320","14452480"," saying I'm always bearish, or maybe I guess you can be like, I'm always bearish or I'm always"
"14452480","14452740"," bullish."
"14453320","14458380"," But if you are, you know when to short and you know when to long at least, like I'm a"
"14458380","14462140"," bull, but I know when to short and I know when to cut the shorts loose and I'm a bull"
"14462140","14464140"," and I know when it long and cut my lungs loose. "
"14464620","14465020"," Make sense?"
"14467680","14468720"," So there you go."
"14468820","14470000"," Hope you guys are learning out there."
"14475480","14478780"," Yeah, I think so I don't think I can lost. "
"14479740","14486900"," I think that I maintain my same view, which is that I can so normally, I think that all right,"
"14486960","14492320"," my same view is that you don't see banks, not even view right here."
"14494300","14495840"," You see this book right here?"
"14496460","14497900"," See that book right there?"
"14499300","14505740"," That book right there tells you who comes into the market first on a bottom."
"14508180","14510560"," And then who comes into the market later after the bottom?"
"14512920","14517880"," So if you read that book, it's going to tell you what to look for. "
"14522310","14523890"," You see this book right here?"
"14524490","14525570"," See that book right there?"
"14525670","14526170"," See that guy?"
"14526930","14528250"," See that guy right there?"
"14529790","14532990"," That guy right there has a Twitter handle."
"14543840","14549940"," Not many Twitter handle and he rambles on inside of the Twitter handle and he leads you into his"
"14549940","14550300"," blog."
"14551460","14556960"," You should you should follow the rabbit trail, the rabbit holes on him going back into like"
"14556960","14560560"," December and find out what he's been saying. "
"14563230","14565610"," He's lost, I've lost, he's lost, that guy's lost."
"14566710","14572430"," That's famously lost money, but he's been rambling on rambling on for the past few months, last"
"14572430","14574870"," month or so about where the market is."
"14576270","14578730"," And I had the opportunity last night. "
"14579410","14584230"," I don't have anyone to catch up with them in some time, but I had the opportunity last night to,"
"14584650","14589190"," I didn't get to watch the whole program, but I caught in and I watched the first 15, 20 minutes"
"14589190","14594370"," of Bob Kendall last night and he made a fucking great point."
"14595110","14600190"," He said, you're going to look back on 2023 and it doesn't matter what the low is."
"14600890","14605530"," You're going to look back in five years and you're going to go, God damn it. "
"14606270","14609570"," I should have been listening to guys like Bob Kendall and Captain Jim James."
"14610730","14611750"," That's what you're going to say."
"14612930","14622270"," I'm with Victor Niederhopper and I'm with fucking the market wizards and I'm with Jedi Marcus and"
"14622270","14625130"," I'm with a fucking Bob Kendall on this. "
"14625910","14626890"," I'm with those guys."
"14627290","14628150"," I'm with Larry Williams."
"14628670","14629250"," I'm with Winky. "
"14629850","14630690"," That's what I'm with."
"14631070","14632050"," That's my gang, bro."
"14633470","14634210"," That's my gang. "
"14639010","14639850"," That's my gang."
"14640990","14642350"," So it's backwards in the camera."
"14643330","14645810"," The first one is called the education of a speculator. "
"14646630","14651230"," And the second one right now is called hedge fund wizards, hedge fund market wizards."
"14652250","14655890"," All of you should be, if you're a bear, you should be reading those fucking things."
"14655970","14657930"," Well, no, if you're a bear, you should be reading hedge fund market wizards. "
"14658970","14660450"," If you're a bear, fuck the bulls."
"14660810","14662390"," If you're a bear, you should read that one."
"14665380","14667180"," You'd be the fucking smartest bear out there. "
"14668780","14671320"," If you're a fucking bear, you should read right now."
"14671460","14673140"," You should be reading hedge fund market wizards."
"14674080","14677420"," If you're a bear, order that shit on Amazon and start reading it. "
"14678280","14686560"," Though, Victor's book is the beginning of Victor's book is very timely as well."
"14690200","14696840"," And all of this got recommended to me from, I've read some of the other books, but not this one."
"14696920","14698520"," Some of the laws should they talk about, I've read those books. "
"14699240","14706930"," You kind of need to read the other books, but you could just read hedge fund market wizards."
"14713680","14715380"," That's right, Kendall is our foundation."
"14716640","14718200"," I was a student of his. "
"14719360","14720480"," I don't know if you guys know that."
"14722680","14726180"," I worship the ground ground that guy, that guy walks on so."
"14727960","14729760"," Worship the ground that that may walks on. "
"14735350","14739070"," Yeah, he does a bunch of interviews of different hedge fund guys."
"14740050","14747730"," And what they talk about, basically what they talk about is like hedge, so you've got like, let's"
"14747730","14748850"," say I work for a bank, right?"
"14749130","14750230"," I'm like, great bank trader."
"14750950","14752310"," Of course, I can't take on risk. "
"14753350","14758630"," So you have the rise of the hedge funds, rise of the hedge funds back in the 80s, 90s."
"14760070","14761810"," And they want to take on risk."
"14762010","14764090"," So I leave a big bank and I'm like, hey, I'm starting hedge fund. "
"14764910","14769970"," And I'm going to ask probably clients and then these banks come to you quietly and they go, the"
"14769970","14772870"," banks come to you quietly and I came in, I want to put some risk on the market."
"14773690","14776090"," So you, you actually put the risk on for the banks."
"14777030","14780850"," And what happens is when you're going to put risk on on the market, the hedge funds enter first. "
"14780970","14787830"," So when you hear dumb money, it's not necessarily, it's not necessarily retail money."
"14788010","14788690"," That's the dumb money."
"14789210","14790350"," It's hedge fund money. "
"14791150","14793530"," And you can see the signs of hedge fund money."
"14794650","14798650"," And when you see like a car, I can come in and go and buy inputs here."
"14799750","14803850"," What he's doing is, I'll show you quickly what he's doing. "
"14804430","14805790"," It's very simple what he's doing."
"14806490","14808270"," He basically bought the bottom and make a Tesla."
"14808950","14812290"," He's hedging the bottom of the congressional budget offices. "
"14812610","14818550"," And he's not going to add to that Tesla for the 2020-20-20-20-20-20-2033 period."
"14818830","14821890"," If he trades on the horseback 220, he'll buy that too."
"14822310","14823870"," And the banks will buy that. "
"14824650","14826050"," You might hear that."
"14827670","14835970"," Then you'll see the size of the market at full cost of all you money on the sidelines coming into"
"14835970","14836230"," the market."
"14836630","14838390"," You won't see that until down the road. "
"14839630","14842690"," Now trading 4.13.07 of GDP."
"14844170","14846930"," We know where the real super strong dwellers are."
"14847070","14847950"," They're way above here. "
"14848170","14850590"," 4.13.07. congressional budget."
"14850590","14852850"," 4.13.30. We have that number earlier."
"14853090","14855630"," We think that they're up high in 2020-20-30. "
"14856190","14857650"," It was going to come down and fuck around."
"14857930","14860830"," GDP growth is about 3% in calendar 20-23."
"14861350","14862770"," One spot 8% in 2024. "
"14863530","14865830"," And two spots 7% in 2025."
"14866670","14868070"," CBO forecast public debt."
"14869210","14873610"," I'm going to do a video on breaks three and 180. "
"14873770","14875750"," If you wanted to, I could read them to you, maybe."
"14876190","14877570"," I could read them."
"14878110","14882010"," You guys could tune in and I'll read them to you or I'm a great reader, by the way. "
"14882010","14882890"," I'm a great reader, by the way."
"14882970","14885390"," It's $3 trillion higher than estimated a year."
"14885830","14891670"," And CBO forecast 10-year treasure yield to 3.9% for 20-23. "
"14892230","14893930"," 3.8% for 2024."
"14894850","14896270"," And 2025 as well."
"14898960","14903180"," They do also add that the Treasury's extraordinary measures could be exhausted before July if"
"14903180","14904820"," received full short of expectations. "
"14905880","14910800"," And that April income tax receipts would weigh heavily on the timing of potential problems"
"14910800","14912460"," servicing debt."
"14914530","14920790"," The US Treasury also exhausted stability for further borrowing sometime between July and September"
"14920790","14923470"," without action to raise the debt limit to the CBO."
"14923870","14926750"," And so it's without the debt limit to increase, also spending the debt limit. "
"14927010","14931630"," The US government would have to delay making payment for the parties default on its debt"
"14931630","14932910"," obligations or both."
"14932910","14938770"," I could do either a discussion podcast or have somebody, I could have a guest on."
"14939270","14943850"," I would, if you wanted, I could ask Janae Marcus to be on maybe for that podcast to discuss. "
"14944430","14953290"," I could have Janae Marcus on to discuss the hedge fund, Market Wizards book, and I could probably"
"14953290","14960170"," have Ball Wizard on taught discuss a neater hopper or I could read the book to you guys if you"
"14960170","14960410"," wanted."
"14962870","14967150"," This stream is sponsored by the right, but I have a bit of a text right allows me to actually"
"14967150","14969870"," hear or to flage them for X and stock instruments."
"14970250","14971570"," I know it's not a free trial. "
"14971850","14972090"," That's right."
"14972410","14976570"," Take strike dot com or on the YouTube video, but I can read a book perfectly."
"14977150","14979510"," So we could do that if you wanted. "
"14986450","14995560"," Yeah, I've always yeah, you know, we're not we're not changing the congressional budget office that"
"14995560","14996220"," we go through there."
"14996320","14998540"," Let's let's let's let's be clear here."
"14998560","15000500"," Okay, we're not moving the fucking signposts. "
"15002160","15003540"," We know that he was inputs."
"15005700","15007180"," We're not moving the signposts."
"15007260","15009920"," Our conversation was about puts that he was in. "
"15010200","15013440"," We're not talking about the calls for the longs for March."
"15013480","15014360"," We're talking about the puts."
"15015260","15020340"," I don't fucking forget what was fucking said on fin to it about the market crash. "
"15020340","15027730"," I don't forget what was said and about I can in the market crash."
"15028410","15032130"," You're not allowed to make statements on fin to it and forget about that shit."
"15034630","15036450"," Red on right on every 10 man. "
"15037330","15038290"," Good job, brother."
"15039110","15039950"," Made money today, man."
"15040770","15042590"," Keep coming up every keep showing up every day. "
"15044310","15046110"," We'll do we'll do something for the books, brother."
"15046930","15048770"," You want me to charge something out for you, Everton?"
"15051280","15052820"," You have a favorite ticker that you have a man?"
"15057600","15058480"," Yeah, exactly."
"15058860","15059860"," We don't do that method here. "
"15060080","15060740"," We don't have the method."
"15060740","15066120"," We create scare tactics and then we sweep it away when it doesn't prove true because what the truth"
"15066120","15069620"," is he probably brought that he probably I can well, he does a bunch of shit."
"15069620","15071120"," He'll provide liquidity to the market. "
"15072240","15074020"," He could have had two intents there."
"15074380","15079020"," One of his intents when he had the puts could have been to limit upside movement in the market,"
"15079020","15082880"," which I think he could have been doing providing liquidity for that to happen."
"15082880","15088440"," And then his other the other thing that he could have been doing at that time was attempting to"
"15088440","15091940"," hedge a much larger long position from underneath. "
"15092740","15093900"," Both make sense."
"15096060","15100560"," But I remember on fin to it, it was I can betting for a market crash."
"15101360","15102860"," That doesn't make any sense to me. "
"15107600","15108660"," He wasn't betting."
"15108880","15115360"," He was either protecting or he was trying to trying to temper an upward move in the market, trying"
"15115360","15119740"," to just stop the market from trading too high, which is what banks want to do."
"15119840","15121940"," They want less volatility in the market. "
"15122400","15124480"," Thanks want much less false."
"15124600","15127040"," They don't care if we go up or down, but they just want less volatility in the market."
"15127340","15128460"," They don't want real price discovery. "
"15134240","15135760"," So I'll be thank you for supporting the channel."
"15135840","15136400"," I appreciate it."
"15139170","15139910"," I appreciate it. "
"15144420","15146120"," You guys want to see CVS H bomb."
"15146260","15146840"," You want to see CVS?"
"15150950","15152290"," Let me look it up in the background, brother."
"15154960","15157480"," HYG now trading higher to 7481. "
"15158900","15160220"," HYG showing the way."
"15167910","15168390"," CVS."
"15169270","15169950"," Let's look at it. "
"15173990","15174430"," Okay."
"15177180","15177660"," CVS."
"15180590","15181070"," Wow. "
"15182830","15184770"," There's our buy box down below to on CVS."
"15187380","15188660"," CVS for the three-trader cluster."
"15189660","15191660"," What would I tell you about CVS would be?"
"15196450","15197270"," It's tough. "
"15198170","15204430"," You know the one thing I would say to you about CVS H bomb is that it's a cyclical stock."
"15207130","15208550"," That's what I would say to you about it."
"15213620","15216980"," I don't want to say too much or I don't know what I can say about it. "
"15226860","15233420"," There's still a price target above on CVS of 93 bucks and I think it can get there, but it's"
"15233420","15234040"," going to be dangerous."
"15258020","15261980"," CVS has a lot of downward momentum coming on it right now."
"15262800","15264540"," Let me look at CVS for you real quick. "
"15267940","15270160"," I get why they're calling for a crash."
"15271260","15273000"," We're getting ahead of ourselves."
"15273480","15277480"," Let's have"
"15280260","15290140"," a little in here. "
"15290660","15295280"," We keep moving the goalposts and you can't move."
"15295540","15296380"," You're not allowed to."
"15296580","15298580"," It's not allowed for you to move the goalposts. "
"15299260","15300920"," You're not allowed to."
"15301220","15303880"," I'm going to tell you, you're not fucking allowed to."
"15304840","15306680"," You can't change the goalposts. "
"15309260","15311060"," We basically hit bottom."
"15313920","15317100"," Red on Tesla gang, Red on Tesla gang."
"15317760","15319220"," Hey James, how are you, man?"
"15321650","15323270"," Now trading for 1310. "
"15325720","15327520"," Now for 1319."
"15329440","15330040"," 1321."
"15333220","15334380"," Yee-haw. "
"15336580","15338420"," We have to talk about something here, okay?"
"15338620","15339680"," Can't change the goalposts."
"15340500","15341340"," It's not allowed."
"15341680","15342120"," I'm serious. "
"15343080","15345780"," And the reason it's not allowed is because you've burned."
"15346820","15356270"," You've literally burned and burned and burned people's money by changing the goalposts."
"15358870","15363390"," And as one thing about Bari that I don't like, I was reading, I was read a story last night"
"15363390","15366750"," on our movies and read it. "
"15367410","15368650"," And all he had was praise."
"15369290","15373870"," And what they don't tell you is that you know why his managers and his partners and his investors"
"15373870","15374330"," were pissed?"
"15375150","15379210"," They were pissed because he missed the entire bull run."
"15379730","15382510"," He was wrong the entire bull run. "
"15382510","15389510"," He missed out on making four to 10 times the amount of money he would have made by going with"
"15389510","15390130"," the bull run."
"15390770","15391870"," He was right once."
"15392970","15398330"," And the one time that he was right, if the market hadn't crashed below where that bull run started,"
"15398690","15399910"," he would have been another failure. "
"15400950","15403890"," So you can be right once a day or once a eight years."
"15404710","15413490"," But when you're out there pumping information to retail traders and you're right eventually."
"15414450","15415430"," But what about price?"
"15416370","15418750"," Because we stopped crashing back in June of 2022. "
"15419770","15423210"," And we started trading sideways up and down and up and down and up and down."
"15423510","15428710"," And in that time period, people got people got destroyed, retailers got destroyed."
"15429670","15434370"," And then in October, hedge funds bought that bottom, not retailers. "
"15435070","15437370"," And then they bought it again in December."
"15438910","15439250"," Okay."
"15439990","15449610"," So we're so if you're going to say crash, we're talking about 345, not 413 17. "
"15451030","15451070"," Okay."
"15452090","15454510"," So not 413 17, we're talking about 345."
"15455750","15457970"," We're still we haven't left that conversation yet. "
"15458450","15459990"," That's where the conversation starts."
"15460730","15463430"," Not at 413 start to 345."
"15465750","15468610"," So what's a crash?"
"15468870","15469630"," Is it 320?"
"15470270","15471370"," That's what my goal is calling for. "
"15471490","15474790"," He's the biggest bear on Wall Street, biggest prime bank bear."
"15474890","15476450"," Now he's saying 3,200 2,800."
"15477210","15481130"," And the one of three five years is gonna be it's gonna be the bottom, right?"
"15481850","15483530"," Unless you're more bearish than he is. "
"15484230","15486370"," So I don't know what I don't want to care about crash."
"15487990","15489790"," What's a crash from here to where?"
"15495900","15500440"," You know, when you're saying like crash, it's like, okay, so you didn't buy the bottom."
"15500680","15504240"," So a bull already knows to have bought October. "
"15504460","15507540"," If a bull doesn't know to have bought October, he knew to buy December."
"15508220","15515680"," If a bull didn't buy October or December, a bull knows not to buy the market until we break above"
"15515680","15517300"," and start trading."
"15517900","15521560"," We hold this or excuse me, I'll show it to you right now. "
"15521640","15522360"," I'm gonna show it to you in Tesla."
"15523720","15527480"," So on, sorry, I'm gonna get back to CVS, I promise."
"15528980","15530080"," Tesla's a prime example. "
"15531480","15533940"," And then I'm gonna show you spy, okay?"
"15535280","15536680"," But I want to show you what I mean here."
"15540210","15541130"," So we're gonna look at Tesla."
"15542650","15543510"," Tesla's a prime example. "
"15543790","15545630"," All of that is a prime example."
"15546230","15548750"," A little of a daily chart, okay?"
"15549890","15552910"," And I'm gonna show you in a daily chart what I'm talking about, okay?"
"15553810","15555830"," Here's Tesla, okay?"
"15562360","15564580"," Bears don't, bulls don't care what you have to say."
"15564700","15565320"," I'll be honest with you. "
"15565580","15566120"," Bulls don't care."
"15566800","15568540"," Bulls bought this right here."
"15569900","15570740"," They bought that. "
"15573580","15574400"," They bought that."
"15574580","15578540"," They bought it, went to $95, 100 bucks, they bought it, okay?"
"15579020","15579680"," Now they don't care."
"15580000","15581440"," They can take their money off here. "
"15582000","15582960"," They can hedge here."
"15585220","15586360"," They can hedge right here."
"15586840","15587740"," That's all they have to do. "
"15588380","15591160"," They can sell calls above what they want, right?"
"15591360","15592180"," That's all they have to do."
"15592400","15594760"," They can sell, they can sell puts down here at 60 bucks."
"15595060","15595560"," They don't care. "
"15596160","15597400"," They don't care if we crash."
"15599200","15600480"," They're not buying here."
"15600660","15603600"," There's no bulls, you're selling this narrative on fin to it. "
"15604440","15609040"," You're selling a narrative on fin to it that bulls are buying this."
"15609480","15610280"," They aren't."
"15610660","15611800"," No bulls buying this. "
"15613200","15614120"," No bulls buying it."
"15614220","15615360"," I'll tell you what bulls are gonna buy."
"15616740","15618260"," I'll tell you where they're gonna buy. "
"15618840","15619460"," I'll show you right here."
"15619940","15621620"," See exactly when bulls are gonna buy."
"15621720","15623660"," I'm gonna tell you exactly when, right?"
"15624660","15625080"," Yep. "
"15625580","15626180"," Blue line right here."
"15627540","15628540"," Let's see where they're gonna buy."
"15629840","15630560"," Tell you what?"
"15631080","15632400"," Is that blue line right there?"
"15634580","15635680"," you see that blue line?"
"15636240","15637900"," I'm going to show you some secret squirrel, okay?"
"15638120","15638400"," Secret squirrel. "
"15639140","15640600"," Something you're not watching as a bear."
"15641780","15642720"," See something you're not watching."
"15643500","15644580"," See that blue line right there?"
"15646160","15646600"," Right?"
"15647680","15649360"," You see that blue line right there?"
"15651840","15655660"," See how momentum we failed, Tesla failed right there?"
"15657240","15657460"," Right?"
"15658300","15659220"," See that failed right there?"
"15659800","15664220"," There's a difference between this and this right here. "
"15664280","15665140"," I'm going to tell you what it is."
"15666280","15669140"," It's that you have momentum coming from underneath."
"15671600","15672820"," We didn't have that before. "
"15673840","15674940"," Coming from underneath."
"15675980","15680080"," See how the yellow line was coming down but the yellow line is now above or was this coming from"
"15680080","15680260"," underneath?"
"15680740","15682740"," It's a little bit of a different time here right?"
"15683720","15685140"," So you're probably going to see bulls."
"15685880","15692940"," So bulls aren't buying it but if price leads above this blue line and consolidates and this yellow"
"15692940","15697180"," line comes up you're probably going to get bulls stepping in a second time. "
"15697800","15700720"," A hedge fund stepping in a second time and buying this."
"15701840","15703700"," Okay that's the bull case believe it or not."
"15703960","15705340"," They buy above this blue line. "
"15706080","15709460"," Now let's say you're screaming bloody murder like we're getting a crash."
"15711180","15712360"," And let's say we sell here."
"15713280","15718640"," Bulls don't care either if you sell here because they already bought this down below and they're"
"15718640","15720280"," going to buy this down below as well. "
"15720940","15721720"," Does it make sense?"
"15723020","15724260"," So bulls don't care."
"15724700","15725760"," Nobody cares about a crash."
"15726020","15727240"," Bulls don't they don't care anymore. "
"15728180","15729740"," You can only go so low."
"15731300","15732400"," So they don't care."
"15732660","15733500"," You can crash it here. "
"15734060","15735420"," Bulls bought this down here."
"15735500","15736720"," They're going to buy this down here."
"15737360","15740220"," They're going to buy this above right here if it consolidates. "
"15740660","15741700"," They don't care."
"15742760","15747940"," They're well hedged in here or they've taken their profit off here."
"15748960","15752800"," But you're being fed a shit sandwich on fin to it. "
"15753660","15754660"," Where you're being told."
"15755020","15758000"," Oh yeah bull bull bull's bonds all pulled up over here."
"15758340","15759040"," Nope nope nope. "
"15759060","15762160"," They're all pulled up down here is what they're pulled up down here bro."
"15762520","15764200"," And they're pulled up down here bro."
"15764740","15766500"," And they're going to be pulled up up here bro. "
"15767440","15768040"," You know what I'm saying?"
"15768780","15770780"," Tell me the bulls are pulled up in here."
"15771440","15772860"," Bulls are pulled up down here."
"15773300","15775080"," They're waiting to buy a dip down here. "
"15775280","15777220"," And they have no problem buying a dip up here."
"15778380","15782020"," All this bull shit in here is all scams man told to buy fin to it."
"15782660","15785040"," Bloomberg CNBC. "
"15787380","15788260"," What what?"
"15788580","15788980"," Barons."
"15790340","15793900"," What what bullshit news services telling you that nobody cares."
"15795440","15796180"," Nobody cares. "
"15798280","15800420"," Tell exactly the bulls out there right here."
"15800820","15801540"," Bulls are here."
"15802280","15802960"," Bulls are here. "
"15803580","15804640"," And bulls are above here."
"15805440","15806680"," Until that shit happens."
"15807200","15807740"," Don't hear it. "
"15807880","15811280"," The craziest part is when we're down here buying right."
"15811700","15814120"," You know what I get you know what I hear all over the fall over fin to it."
"15814380","15815280"," Don't do it dude. "
"15820680","15821640"," Don't hear it."
"15821640","15822260"," I don't hear it."

"16006120","16006400"," You know why?"
"16006720","16009920"," Because they're not going to push the narrative of what you should be doing. "
"16010340","16021130"," They're going to"
"16021130","16021330"," do it."
"16023210","16023550"," Right."

"16041570","16043690"," bag holder so you can feel better about being a bag holder."
"16043910","16044350"," Is that what you want?"
"16045190","16046650"," They can be that guy if that's what you want."
"16053100","16054160"," Is that what you guys want?"
"16054620","16055180"," I'll do it. "
"16055640","16056280"," We can do that."
"16057060","16058820"," I'll make you guys bag holders on a ticker."
"16059300","16059380"," Right. "
"16060280","16061780"," I'll do it but I'll sound smart."
"16061780","16065400"," I'll have a bunch of displays back here and I'll read a bunch of shit to make me sound smart."
"16066320","16067720"," Well I'll make you bag holders. "
"16068480","16074280"," Then you're locked in because you followed me in a trade and then I'll entertain you every day"
"16074280","16075440"," until it goes back up."
"16075620","16078860"," Meanwhile you'll pay for a fucking class or some shit."
"16084020","16085380"," Isn't that fucked up?"
"16086300","16089100"," That's right. "
"16090580","16091340"," No."
"16092600","16096780"," I don't want to do that again."
"16102000","16104460"," Look at my white bar up there. "
"16110890","16115630"," No bags please."
"16120890","16123450"," Now I'm just saying be careful what you're consuming out there."
"16123650","16126830"," What you're being told a billionaire telling you what they're doing. "
"16127570","16130110"," You think some billionaires trying to help you the retail trader."
"16130470","16131290"," They give a shit about you."
"16132090","16133810"," Give a fine fuck about who you are. "
"16134770","16139390"," And then you think about the three or four time or five time regurgitation, missed interpretation,"
"16139850","16142470"," misunderstanding of how markets work."
"16143030","16143690"," All that shit."
"16145010","16150490"," The rocket scientists out there that the data driven rocket scientists that are like I got it. "
"16150590","16150890"," I got it."
"16150970","16152210"," I got it in the smartest guy in the room."
"16152230","16152630"," I got it. "
"16153790","16154150"," I got it."
"16154250","16154550"," I got it."
"16154630","16154950"," I got it. "
"16155150","16155950"," I got it."
"16162850","16164850"," And then they're like it's not supposed to happen like this."
"16164850","16165930"," And you're like yeah it is. "
"16166410","16168170"," That's exactly how it's supposed to happen."
"16179180","16181520"," But whatever."
"16182020","16182880"," We're a floats of boat. "
"16183720","16185160"," Greatest soap opera in the world."
"16185160","16185960"," The stock market."
"16187980","16188960"," Story sells. "
"16190100","16204530"," In the smarter you sound, the smarter you sound, the"
"16204530","16206890"," more you can sell."
"16212010","16212890"," It's probably done."
"16213170","16213870"," So right up here. "
"16214670","16215790"," That's probably done here."
"16215890","16216850"," There could be one more time."
"16216990","16217430"," We'll take a look. "
"16217730","16217950"," Okay."
"16218150","16218610"," So here we go."
"16219850","16221850"," We'll take a look at the day and see what's going on. "
"16222110","16223370"," Now let's take a look at the rest of the week."
"16223390","16223650"," Okay."
"16224030","16225110"," Let's get soberish in here. "
"16226530","16227790"," We're gonna get soberish."
"16229910","16230310"," Okay."
"16230370","16231710"," I'm gonna start thinking about some stuff here. "
"16231770","16232590"," Thinking about thinking about."
"16235050","16236930"," And we're gonna start talking here."
"16237130","16237270"," Okay. "
"16239090","16240770"," Let me do some work here in the background."
"16240770","16241830"," We're gonna start looking at it."
"16243190","16243830"," Probably done. "
"16244890","16245710"," Slowing down here."
"16245990","16247370"," I want you to see something here, right?"
"16248030","16249610"," So you look in the one minute try right now."
"16250630","16252270"," See how that woman is curling sideways. "
"16252270","16254250"," I want you to take profit off here."
"16257990","16259230"," Now see how we're curving."
"16259310","16259950"," See the white chart. "
"16260150","16260530"," See the white."
"16260850","16265870"," The white line is starting to go horizontal and not lateral now."
"16266350","16268050"," See how it's starting to roll. "
"16268390","16269710"," The market's that you can actually see the roll."
"16269870","16270930"," See the straight line up."
"16271730","16272690"," Straight line up, right?"
"16273430","16274550"," And then a little bit to the left. "
"16275530","16277650"," Does that mean we can't go and slap the high?"
"16278030","16278550"," No, we can."
"16279250","16283310"," But this is the place where you're seeing the bulls start losing momentum."
"16284630","16289350"," And we could likely come back down and we start to recheck the five minute right here. "
"16289490","16289650"," Okay."
"16290410","16293190"," Now we could slap the new high and then come back down here."
"16293330","16293910"," Doesn't matter. "
"16294390","16294830"," Okay."
"16295030","16298670"," So this is where the place where you're starting to look around and go, I might try getting out"
"16298670","16298910"," here."
"16300010","16303130"," Or let's say you were like, whoa, it was long and four 1353 capital. "
"16303830","16307530"," There's a chance we'll do one more retest above and then start rolling it over."
"16308650","16312310"," This is kind of like the place where you're getting long in the tooth on the daily trade right"
"16312310","16312530"," here."
"16312750","16312850"," Okay. "
"16313410","16316330"," A little bit long in the tooth in the trade."
"16316750","16319090"," Now does that mean the market starts bloodbath in at 412.48?"
"16319510","16319930"," I don't know."
"16320110","16321510"," We're going to take a look and find out right now though. "
"16323530","16324490"," So we're going to get up here."
"16326070","16328810"," And we're going to look to see what's going on."
"16330130","16333130"," We're going to look to see what's going on the background of the market right here. "
"16334250","16336350"," And how the market really runs, right?"
"16340340","16342440"," Not because we're just the smartest guy in the room."
"16344720","16345500"," Yeah, it's funny."
"16345700","16350760"," A buddy of mine is an accomplished engineer. "
"16351900","16355620"," And he had a complicated HVAC system."
"16357080","16359640"," And he couldn't figure out how to wire a smart home."
"16360420","16362220"," And I went and wired it for him. "
"16363000","16366840"," And he was like, after I'd wired it for him, he was like, man, he's like, I'm so pissed off"
"16366840","16367260"," right now."
"16367260","16367820"," And I was like, why?"
"16368060","16370700"," And he's like, he's like, I'm very smart."
"16372140","16374740"," And he's like, and the fact that you're the figure this out. "
"16375920","16378040"," And I couldn't."
"16380360","16381780"," And I was like, you know what it reminds me of?"
"16382220","16384960"," I was like, you have an engineer, right?"
"16385580","16388020"," It was very smart that can design something."
"16388880","16393419"," But sometimes you get like a handyman would be a good example. "
"16394380","16398180"," And the handyman can hack something together for you, right?"
"16398240","16401300"," Or know how something actually works, right?"
"16401500","16405099"," So I could tell a guy I want, like a program, building houses and stuff is kind of like a"
"16405099","16407140"," very concept, right?"
"16407300","16410400"," I get guys that will write up designs for me to build the house."
"16410800","16416240"," I'll get architects that will sometimes, especially when I'm doing like LVLs and stuff like that,"
"16416400","16418020"," trying to knock out walls and stuff."
"16418439","16421860"," They get to put this stuff down inside the, you got to dig a hole, you got to pour concrete"
"16421860","16423000"," base, you got to be this big. "
"16423800","16427759"," But they don't tell me, but they can't actually, if we encounter a problem, they're like, I don't"
"16427759","16428500"," know how to fuck with that."
"16428619","16431300"," And I'm like, all right, so I got to rebuild it at that point, right?"
"16431740","16435419"," So you've got two guys, you got the smart guy, and you got like the construction guy."
"16436540","16437259"," They're two different people. "
"16437880","16442500"," So you got to trust the smart guys, but at the same time, that construction guy is the guy doing"
"16442500","16443279"," the actual work."
"16444040","16446000"," And that's the trader, right?"
"16446160","16447060"," He's the construction guy."
"16447480","16448580"," So tomorrow, okay?"
"16448779","16454640"," So tomorrow is a 216, give an implied move tomorrow of 415.99, okay?"
"16455740","16460980"," And 410.05. Currently, at this moment, right where we are right now, applied move tomorrow. "
"16461439","16468919"," We have some range expansion coming up though, on the 17th, we have explosive range expansion"
"16468919","16470520"," starting on the 21st."
"16471040","16473880"," And then into the 30th, now we have range expansion."
"16474919","16479720"," Believe it or not, into the end of the month, we have some huge range expansion down at 405. "
"16480320","16487259"," And not shockingly, into March, we expect a low in the 390s, not market crafts."
"16488240","16491720"," So you've got people screaming on fin to it right now, we were just told that we're going to market"
"16491720","16491960"," crash."
"16492240","16493279"," How do you protect against that?"
"16493939","16494640"," You buy cheap puts. "
"16495540","16501380"," If we're getting the market crash, if we're getting a market crash in the February, so you're on,"
"16501380","16503720"," you're on my chat right now, same, we're going to market crash."
"16504200","16504919"," That's what we're getting, right?"
"16506460","16507720"," Tell me we're getting the market crash."
"16508099","16511500"," Okay, let's look at Mark 31st. "
"16512259","16522020"," Now, I'm a 32"
"16522020","16531599"," hundred, what a 3600 cost, 85 cents, 92 cents for 360 March 31st,"
"16532040","16535460"," 13th, throw some on, hear a bull throw some on."
"16535880","16542460"," All right, no problem, 92 cents in their juice at 92 cents, juiced."
"16543340","16546080"," They should be like 30 or 60 cents, but they're juiced up. "
"16547540","16552200"," Looks like somebody needs a market crash on March 31st in my view, but they're expensive."
"16552720","16559480"," But anyways, they're still dirt deep, 92 cents for some crash protection, dirt deep, 3200 for March"
"16559480","16560320"," 31st."
"16561040","16563000"," That's the call from Mike Wilson. "
"16563800","16569020"," Those are dirt deep, 24 cents, 24 cents."
"16569939","16572740"," You have another prediction from Mike Wilson right now, 2,800."
"16573700","16575020"," Those are eight cents. "
"16576580","16578419"," Some crash protection for you."
"16580200","16590220"," You got eight cent pennies for a crash protection at 2,800, 3,200, dirt"
"16590220","16593640"," deep, 24 cents, 24 cents, crash protection."
"16596500","16598400"," 360, 90 cents. "
"16599500","16600580"," Should I sell here?"
"16600939","16605619"," Probably not, but I could buy some protection, right?"
"16606380","16610040"," So that's how we know that puts are cheap, right?"
"16610320","16616340"," So we're not selling, we're buying cheap puts to protect our crafts."
"16617779","16618300"," Make sense?"
"16620180","16621580"," So while we're up here, what am I doing?"
"16621919","16623400"," I'm like, okay, we're getting the crash."
"16624419","16625480"," I want to buy higher. "
"16625740","16627740"," I'm not willing to buy until we go higher or lower."
"16628360","16633060"," So I'm either flat with nothing or I'm going to buy some hedging and wait to buy a bottom."
"16633980","16638460"," So if the if the bears are right and we're going to crash, there there it is. "
"16638779","16639460"," There's our crash."
"16639919","16641439"," I just printed fat money."
"16642119","16644180"," I already bought Tesla at 100 bucks. "
"16645419","16646700"," So sweet, I get it at $65."
"16648060","16649080"," Now I'm in at what?"
"16649720","16651800"," $85, DCA of $85."
"16652320","16655900"," Every crash since the beginning of the stock market last one month. "
"16656880","16660180"," So that $85 buy in is probably up now to 100 and something."
"16660700","16661520"," It's going to last one month."
"16662240","16666320"," I got printed on my hedge fat money. "
"16668020","16669500"," I didn't have to sell shit."
"16672060","16673040"," So I'm not selling."
"16673880","16674640"," I'm either flat. "
"16674939","16676500"," I own and I bought a cheap hedge."
"16677060","16677580"," And guess what?"
"16678020","16680520"," My my fucking 30 cent fucking puts."
"16681340","16685020"," If they don't print and we go up, I'm going to make fat money there too. "
"16685680","16687060"," I'll win either way."
"16687520","16688939"," I'm going to win owning Tesla."
"16690060","16692180"," I'm going to win if Tesla goes up. "
"16692419","16693660"," I'm going to win if we crash."
"16696020","16697480"," I'm going to win on my hedge."
"16700150","16705090"," I'm going to win when the bottom kicks in and in Tesla's at 65 bucks because I bought it 100. "
"16705250","16706250"," I bought it 65."
"16706849","16707509"," It lasts a month."
"16707849","16708630"," I'm at $85. "
"16709029","16710509"," Tesla's probably back up to 100 bucks."
"16710910","16712930"," I printed a fat hedge on 29 cents."
"16719400","16719960"," I win. "
"16721240","16723119"," I win."
"16724099","16724480"," I win."
"16724680","16724980"," I win. "
"16725160","16725320"," I win."
"16725320","16726300"," I win it all."
"16726619","16727080"," I win it all. "
"16727619","16728200"," You lose."
"16736840","16737500"," So I win."
"16738900","16744720"," If I'm not long under underlying right now, I don't buy here, but yeah, I buy some cheap hedges. "
"16745259","16745520"," Okay."
"16746619","16748259"," Am I selling the spy here?"
"16748480","16750419"," Like am I going to go in and start selling the spy?"
"16750700","16751060"," Fuck no."
"16751880","16753320"," Fuck no, I'm not selling the spy. "
"16754240","16755759"," Am I going to short the spy here?"
"16755980","16756520"," Fuck no, dangerous."
"16757520","16759099"," No reason to short the spy here."
"16759800","16762439"," The only thing to do here in the spy is buy some cheap puts. "
"16764279","16765460"," Oh, buy them all."
"16765619","16766740"," Buy 90 cents at 360."
"16767279","16768560"," Buy 30 cents at 3,200. "
"16769439","16772040"," Buy fucking 3 cents at 2,800."
"16773020","16773759"," Buy them from March."
"16774000","16774700"," Buy them for June. "
"16776880","16777620"," But sell the spy?"
"16778400","16778820"," No, why?"
"16779220","16779740"," What's that?"
"16780060","16781860"," All the risk is on me of us going up."
"16783000","16790420"," I can burn $1.40 to hedge $1.40. I pissed that away at a half a day here."
"16791680","16791840"," Right?"
"16792080","16792220"," Okay. "
"16792360","16793080"," So let's look at the rest of the week."
"16797990","16798710"," That's the truth."
"16799550","16802890"," And that's what scares the shit out of anybody that's short this market right now. "
"16805520","16807480"," Or that is short this market right now."
"16807660","16808080"," That's the truth."
"16809300","16810080"," You can't short this one. "
"16810160","16819200"," You can't sell two dangerous to short the market right here."
"16819900","16820500"," Two dangerous."
"16820800","16821520"," You can only buy puts. "
"16822480","16822800"," Okay."
"16823040","16824560"," So the real super strong swallers are above."
"16826000","16828160"," What is the expectation of a move for this week?"
"16829240","16831200"," We've got a two days left here. "
"16832920","16833680"," Let's look at that."
"16833780","16835460"," Let's look at the implied move is into Friday."
"16835720","16837000"," Okay, so the 17th, right?"
"16837260","16845150"," We've got 417.07. We'll buy some puts though. "
"16846250","16846830"," I get that."
"16847030","16848310"," You want to buy some puts that dumb down."
"16856720","16857840"," Boom, red sell. "
"16859440","16861140"," We're going to now turn this into yellow."
"16864750","16865530"," Right there."
"16866050","16868670"," Yellow, red, yellow, red right there. "
"16869710","16871790"," We know that the buyers are down here, right?"
"16877490","16878730"," Boom, there's the buyers."
"16889010","16889910"," Easy, right?"
"16891390","16893110"," Can we trade outside of a applied range?"
"16893430","16893710"," Absolutely."
"16893710","16895630"," Pinking above 417 absolutely. "
"16895910","16900610"," I want you to know that back here, our implied move higher was 419 and 420."
"16901450","16905350"," I want you to realize that the levels are coming down here, right?"
"16905850","16906850"," Closing in on the on the bulls."
"16907270","16909590"," To me personally, I think we go down. "
"16910010","16910990"," I think we're weak."
"16911490","16913990"," I think we're weak into end of September."
"16914290","16915230"," Personally, I do. "
"16915410","16916430"," I want to see us be weak."
"16916610","16917810"," I want to see us get down to 402."
"16918350","16919830"," I want to see us get down to 396. "
"16920390","16921490"," I'm on the bare side of this."
"16922370","16924250"," This is where I really want to buy down here."
"16926820","16927980"," No matter how high we go. "
"16928780","16930560"," I want to buy this."
"16930940","16931580"," I want to buy this."
"16933260","16934160"," That's what I want to buy. "
"16934260","16934900"," Something like that."
"16935380","16936920"," I love buying down here."
"16937120","16939400"," It's so much safer for me to buy down here. "
"16940520","16941300"," Does that make sense?"
"16941940","16943280"," So much safer for me to buy down there."
"16948020","16951140"," So what do I think is going to happen for tomorrow?"
"16951840","16956080"," We got here 15th, 16th, 17th for Thursday."
"16957700","16958720"," I don't know. "
"16959180","16960340"," But I do know this."
"16962380","16963780"," I do know this, okay?"
"16966020","16968660"," I'm going to buy it down below until I'm proven otherwise."
"16970120","16973720"," I'm a seller above unless proven otherwise, right?"
"16974200","16975680"," So I'm buying this down here. "
"16976380","16984400"," And if I get told no, if I find out the buyers aren't here, I have a stop loss."
"16985260","16985920"," Make sense?"
"16988640","16996260"," If I'm a seller right here and we start to hold and trade higher, I have a stop loss above."
"16996620","16997120"," Does that make sense?"
"16998320","17002740"," In the Friday stops, stops, long short. "
"17004140","17005640"," My bias is down."
"17006700","17009500"," My bias, no matter how high we go is down in 10 to month."
"17010840","17013200"," I want to see us cool this shit off. "
"17014540","17017520"," Now, if we don't cool it off, let's see your super bowl out there."
"17017600","17018900"," You're like, Oh, no, no, no, no cap."
"17019220","17021760"," We're going to start gapping it up. "
"17022000","17023180"," I'm like, I get what you're saying."
"17024080","17029360"," I get what you're throwing down because I know what you're saying, you're saying, saying cap, big"
"17029360","17031540"," dog, we're going to gap it up tomorrow."
"17033560","17036140"," Yeah, we're going, we're going moon shot here tomorrow. "
"17036860","17041220"," And so I look here and I go, he's got damn holes."
"17042300","17043840"," Where are they going here?"
"17045700","17049220"," And I bet if I measured this right here, I bet it's right here."
"17050840","17051700"," R3, baby. "
"17052260","17054140"," 422, Valhalla."
"17055500","17056580"," That's where we're going."
"17057520","17058620"," We're going to Valhalla. "
"17059240","17059580"," Look at this."
"17059700","17062820"," Look at this one hour chart down and up."
"17063620","17065560"," One hour, bullish is all hell. "

"17078170","17080230"," How do I trade this beast mode up here?"
"17082150","17084130"," For Friday, how do I trade this pretty easy?"
"17084550","17086250"," We're going to take a look at some shit for the weekend. "
"17086710","17087010"," You ready?"

"17131370","17132590"," Just ripping face. "
"17133490","17134990"," You're like, oh, they're never going to print that cap."
"17135230","17135830"," I'm like, who gets?"
"17136150","17137670"," There's not a lot of time on that cap."
"17137950","17138170"," Okay. "
"17139150","17140990"," Let's look at the 21st."

"17186070","17187110"," What do we just buy these for?"
"17193130","17203090"," We bought these and we're not willing to buy 402 P's for Monday and you can even get closer"
"17203090","17204370"," like 404s. "

"17227990","17228770"," Mind block."
"17230890","17232270"," What initial claims are."
"17233930","17235930"," So you don't care what claims are. "
"17236670","17237470"," You trade both sides."
"17237830","17242230"," I bet you, not bet you, but it wouldn't shock me to see both sides of that print."
"17242870","17245710"," It wouldn't surprise me. "
"17247430","17252370"," It wouldn't surprise me and I'll see both sides of that print, but what you bet take both bets."
"17254590","17255370"," Not Monday."

"17287920","17289420"," We're calling for a market crash on Fintuit."
"17291180","17298140"," If you get a market crash for now on Friday, that shit's going to print like a machine."
"17299860","17304940"," In the call side, if we don't get the market crash, it's going to print like a machine. "
"17311940","17315600"," Thanks Ollie for the question."
"17316920","17323920"," Yeah, Friday, 422 and Monday, Monday, or not Monday, so I could say Monday, February 21st, right?"

"17446480","17447960"," I'm a velocity trader."
"17448180","17449120"," I try to trade up and down. "
"17450500","17454360"," But I know people like taking shit where they're like, I want to guarantee what's going to win."
"17456140","17459860"," You know it'd be hilarious, though, is if we fucking trade sideways right into Friday."
"17462720","17466640"," That would be some shit right there, we just trade straight across into Friday. "
"17467340","17469600"," Can you imagine if we just trade front sideways into Friday?"
"17470620","17473380"," Fucking torch the entire fucking options market."
"17473980","17474880"," That would be hilarious."
"17476300","17479520"," Fate again comes out in Friday and they're like, fuck all of you guys. "
"17486930","17489010"," Can you guys imagine that shit?"
"17490770","17495010"," Can you imagine if they just fucking just burned up both sides right into Friday?"
"17503130","17506130"," He got like all these butterfly guys."
"17506330","17507170"," We're just like, whoa."
"17516170","17517990"," All doing high fives and shit. "
"17518910","17519670"," What's a nerds?"
"17521770","17522890"," No offense to nerds."
"17526750","17528410"," I think they're going to sell today, though."
"17529490","17533890"," I think that I think the butterfly guys are my assumption is that today is closed. "
"17534130","17535090"," The butterfly guys are closing."
"17535790","17538170"," Hey, we talked about butterflies yesterday, right?"
"17540150","17541190"," Look at this."
"17541270","17542630"," You guys want some fucked up?"
"17543090","17546390"," Remember yesterday when I said, uh, we're like right here. "
"17547670","17548550"," Remember right here?"
"17548670","17551430"," And I said, you should put a butterfly, a wide butterfly on for Wednesday clothes."
"17566580","17569400"," You guys remember we talked about the butterfly yesterday for Wednesday?"
"17575450","17576150"," Too funny."
"17577110","17578610"," Butterfly guys out there right there. "
"17578690","17578930"," Whoo."
"17579090","17579170"," Yeah."
"17579590","17579950"," Fly guy. "
"17581610","17583150"," Got a full wing butterfly, bro."
"17583530","17584190"," No broken wings."
"17584330","17585070"," I'm managing that shit. "
"17587600","17588820"," You're so hyper cocaine bear."
"17589300","17589700"," Yeah."
"17591520","17592200"," Take the trade, man. "
"17592720","17593540"," Tell us what you are."
"17593900","17596860"," If you're a bear, uh, are you, are you, are you in some shorts?"
"17598080","17603840"," I think puts pay better, uh, personally, but if you get the velocity down, I think the, I think"
"17603840","17606120"," puts pay better than being short and they're dirt cheap."
"17606760","17609800"," Fucking cost to hold those things are the cost of a put right now. "
"17616360","17616580"," Yeah."
"17616640","17618800"," Put a yes back up for you or a book, book map."
"17621980","17622340"," Yeah. "
"17622420","17631160"," Market to mayhem as he doesn't need to, uh, doesn't, uh, market to mayhem do yes and, uh, book map,"
"17631160","17631400"," right?"
"17637740","17638100"," Yeah."
"17638200","17640100"," I'm going with the upside move in the end of the Friday."
"17640400","17642840"," I think we go to 4.22. I think we see that. "
"17643000","17647980"," That's my call so far, but I want it to go down so bad."
"17647980","17651020"," Like my feelings are giving a dip by, but right now."
"17651960","17653500"," 4.22 sees, baby. "
"17653940","17662410"," 4.22 see dirt, buck and sheep."
"17662650","17663670"," Look at those dirt cheap calls."
"17663910","17665210"," Everybody's paired up, man. "
"17665970","17667610"," Bearish, bearish, bearish, bearish."
"17692780","17697040"," If we slap 4.22, people would lose their minds."
"17706060","17711160"," People would, people would straight lose their minds if you don't 4.22. And we have to 4.22"
"17711160","17711620"," tomorrow. "
"17711860","17712620"," People would lose their minds."
"17712620","17721900"," Bonds aren't tanking."
"17722680","17724900"," I don't know why people are telling you bonds are tanking. "
"17725540","17726800"," I don't know why people keep saying that."
"17727940","17729100"," Bonds aren't tanking."
"17730340","17731400"," They haven't tanked yet. "
"17740620","17742600"," I just bought some calls on the spot."
"17746800","17749120"," I just bought some lotos for Monday."
"17749340","17755250"," So Monday lotos. "
"17758170","17758890"," Yeah, man."
"17764010","17766310"," Yeah, I bought some lotos."
"17770600","17771880"," They gap this shit up. "
"17771960","17772360"," Look at this."
"17772660","17779480"," If they gap this shit up, they gap this shit up and measure that shit up there."
"17783550","17784910"," They gap this up, man. "
"17787890","17789830"," Look at that double bottom right there."
"17791510","17792770"," Double bottom right there."
"17793790","17796310"," No velocity to the downside for the bears over here. "
"17799390","17800710"," That's, that's called an L."
"17801370","17802090"," A loss."
"17803330","17804470"," It's a big fat L."
"17808010","17809210"," It's a big fat L for the bears."
"17810590","17811890"," I love the bears, but that's an L."
"17812470","17814270"," This is not, this is bad for the bears. "
"17822010","17823350"," That's bad look right here."
"17825390","17826650"," It's a bad look for bears."
"17827050","17828170"," Bears don't want to see this, man. "
"17830990","17832610"," I'll tell you what the bears wanted to see."
"17832790","17834590"," Bears wanted to see a new low down here."
"17834890","17835030"," Minimum. "
"17836370","17838070"," Minimum wanted to see a new low."
"17840930","17842610"," They needed to see that new low."
"17846710","17850910"," They got a kick-ass low down here, then they didn't get the low today. "
"17851930","17852830"," So they needed it."
"17852950","17855070"," They needed to get down here, right?"
"17855210","17861350"," You get the close above or below S1 and you start looking for lower, lower lows down here."
"17862150","17863090"," That's what they needed. "
"17867150","17868690"," I had puts down here."
"17869550","17871250"," I was here with you guys on live stream."
"17871610","17875270"," When we were down here, I bought puts instead of we're going down. "
"17875450","17875790"," I'm on it."
"17877270","17880370"," I'm on this trade and they couldn't get it."
"17883240","17891520"," So now what you can do if you want is you can get some 404s, 402s for Friday, or you"
"17891520","17894260"," can take the trade for Friday to 420 up here. "
"17895940","17897820"," That's the trade that I'm talking about to you."
"17899420","17905180"," But the high probability trade, the high probability trade here if we're going to make a move for"
"17905180","17908540"," what we look like right now is some kind of a squeeze higher to 422."
"17909360","17913580"," Now there could be the bloodbath on the initial, get up there. "
"17914060","17916320"," There could be the bloodbath and we trade down here."
"17918060","17920000"," But this is a no-brainer trade."
"17920120","17921360"," It's like a 56 cent trade. "
"17922800","17924060"," It's 56 cents."
"17925920","17927020"," And you're going to be right."
"17927200","17927920"," I guarantee it. "
"17928020","17932860"," When we're another, well, I shouldn't say that."
"17933060","17936100"," When we're another, someone's going to be right here or right down here."
"17937820","17940780"," Unless theta gang just just fucks everybody. "
"17941180","17943600"," I guess that's option three."
"17944900","17948340"," My bet is it's one, two, and three."
"17957780","17958820"," I should move this up. "
"17960540","17960980"," Yeah."
"17979660","17981680"," Bullish as fuck."
"17986260","17987840"," Bullish as fuck right now. "
"17991370","17992910"," Bullish right here."
"17993050","17995490"," That's the, that's the tell right there."
"17995990","17996690"," Look at the hourly. "
"17997210","17998330"," Look at the hourly right here."
"18002130","18006290"," You really want to, if you want to be bearish here, actually the trade's probably not even right"
"18006290","18006510"," here."
"18006710","18014610"," It's below 4.11.23. You need to get below 4.11.23 to get bearish. "
"18015850","18017070"," Change trend."
"18020650","18021910"," It's even lower actually."
"18025070","18028110"," You need to get below 4.10.64 to be bearish here. "
"18028750","18030770"," 4.10.64 to get bearish."
"18035570","18036290"," Daily chart."
"18043120","18044520"," Just screaming higher. "
"18045480","18046120"," Just screaming."
"18047300","18049180"," I don't know, man."
"18052500","18053380"," Well, let's see. "
"18054280","18055000"," Here we go."
"18055120","18059620"," Let's look at a five minute interaction with the five minute right now."
"18060060","18061840"," I'm going to look at some zero dates for today. "
"18071290","18073270"," We're going to find out if this holds or not."
"18073630","18079030"," So if you're a bear out there, bulls don't want to give up this white line right here."
"18080030","18081850"," They want to hold this line up into the close. "
"18082930","18088270"," If we start to trade under it, bears will be in charge in tomorrow."
"18088430","18093090"," Some volatility into the claims report tomorrow."
"18093090","18094930"," We'll see how this goes into the bell. "
"18095790","18098730"," It's at 2.54. Power hour is starting right now."
"18099610","18101950"," This is where bulls are in charge if you want to know."
"18104610","18107110"," So right now, crown this white line that you're looking at. "
"18108690","18110010"," Let me get rid of this white line right here."
"18115570","18116950"," I can't believe this noise."
"18117270","18120850"," I don't like trading this stuff, but get rid of that. "
"18134850","18136470"," We'll pay attention to this line right here."
"18136470","18138690"," We'll stay on the five minute chart for you so you can see."
"18142750","18148590"," Let's see if the bears can get control of the market. "
"18154030","18163720"," If you guys want to see,"
"18174810","18185170"," if you guys want to bring up here, I'll bring this up for you so you"
"18185170","18185170"," can see in a better way."
"18187390","18191330"," Let's look at what we're looking at."
"18191450","18191670"," Look at that. "
"18191710","18192210"," See that green?"
"18192850","18194290"," Let me unmute the book map for you."
"18195550","18196390"," See you guys here."
"18196630","18196850"," Okay. "
"18197310","18202910"," So nice little plow."
"18203050","18204150"," Nice little move higher."
"18205350","18206550"," Fire is stepped in right?"
"18207230","18210790"," Fire stepped back in on the hourly. "
"18211410","18215430"," So what we're going to do is we're going to look for week on the hourly, right?"
"18216330","18221250"," So what we're looking for is another buying opportunity, right?"
"18222030","18228550"," So we either want to see if we're accepted down below here."
"18229810","18231010"," We're going to watch this right here."
"18234670","18235610"," Where's the other reject?"
"18236410","18237490"," Let's bring that back over. "
"18238510","18247950"," We're going to watch the this is"
"18247950","18251410"," the, I believe this is the five minute."
"18252430","18255450"," So the five minute is week, right?"
"18257110","18259030"," We don't have a week hourly yet."
"18262800","18264320"," We want to see how this acts. "
"18264820","18265960"," So what we're going to do, pull us in here."
"18267480","18268200"," Hit our target above."
"18268360","18269300"," Look at this target. "
"18270600","18271540"," Almost perfect, right?"
"18272040","18273340"," Almost the perfect tag above here."
"18274240","18278240"," So almost how perfect that was right there to recheck again."
"18279380","18280840"," Well, we're going to move this down now. "
"18281620","18284680"," We're going to use it for the next phase."
"18288090","18290230"," The sellers are coming in trying to sell it down."
"18290530","18292010"," See the rejection above?"
"18292950","18293870"," You can see this. "
"18294790","18296610"," A second here."
"18301680","18303320"," And you can see right here."
"18306240","18307620"," And change this to red. "
"18317190","18318950"," Right here, pears want to hold this, okay?"
"18320470","18322670"," So pears want to hold this here."
"18323810","18324870"," This is called a bear plane."
"18326170","18328910"," We'll go through this one more time if you guys did this earlier with you guys. "
"18329050","18329430"," We'll do it again."
"18331250","18331510"," Okay."
"18332330","18334250"," Do you want to see this one minute come down?"
"18335510","18337550"," You want to see the red. "
"18339130","18341510"," Come over."
"18342590","18345130"," You want to see price."
"18345370","18346830"," We should see price go down some more. "
"18347510","18349250"," Well, you want to see a rejection above here."
"18349970","18351490"," And then a leading down, okay?"
"18352310","18353430"," Two, four, eleven, fifty."
"18354030","18354390"," Makes sense?"
"18355590","18360130"," Now when we're down here, that's not about the first push through. "
"18360430","18361610"," It's about the second, right?"
"18361970","18365290"," It's always about like push through, right?"
"18365710","18366110"," Rejection."
"18366870","18367590"," We want to get underneath."
"18368370","18370450"," Pears want to get committed sellers. "
"18371590","18374090"," So we already know that the options market guys are out."
"18375010","18376470"," We want to reject right here."
"18376830","18380510"," They want to accept right here, down move, right?"
"18380610","18381790"," And if you're a bull, what do you want to do?"
"18382810","18384570"," So you want to be buying down here, right?"
"18384750","18387010"," We already know we want to buy, right?"
"18388510","18390130"," That's what we want to buy is down here. "
"18390530","18392450"," So, passable."
"18393150","18402290"," You want to see, you want to see this come down."
"18403150","18404830"," You don't want to see this right there. "
"18405030","18405610"," You don't want to see that."
"18405930","18406710"," Bears don't want to see that."
"18409110","18411130"," But you want to see this green line come up. "
"18412770","18414630"," You want to see this red line get underneath."
"18415330","18416090"," You want to see price."
"18417010","18417630"," Right there. "
"18418190","18419590"," Start to head higher again."
"18419750","18420010"," Makes sense?"
"18420810","18422430"," I'm doing that right for you or not."
"18423190","18428470"," So this red box right here, you want to see this rejection here to go lower. "
"18429170","18432590"," If you want to buy puts here, you'd be looking for rejection."
"18433350","18436570"," You're looking for this rejection right here in this one minute."
"18437290","18438490"," Watch this one minute right here. "
"18442050","18445190"," And I don't like seeing this green box for bears."
"18445450","18446070"," I don't like seeing it."
"18447290","18452790"," So if I'm bearish, I want to see this blue, I want to see this green, even though price is"
"18452790","18455770"," going higher, I want to see the blue lines start going down. "
"18456350","18456730"," Makes sense?"
"18457290","18461710"," Even if price is going higher, I want to see a blue line coming down, I want to see price"
"18461710","18463870"," going higher so that it rejects and we head lower."
"18464670","18465090"," Makes sense?"
"18466130","18467030"," So you can see it's their case."
"18467870","18470330"," It'll actually staircase down like this. "
"18471190","18472610"," Even if price is going up."
"18474270","18478870"," Even if price is showing you something different, the divergence is what shows you where a bottom"
"18478870","18479590"," will get bought."
"18480110","18480110"," Okay. "
"18481630","18483810"," So right now bottom got bought."
"18484870","18487430"," We're going to wait to see now if"
"18487430","18497470"," it'll reject 41260."
"18498390","18501130"," As a matter of fact, I can put the red, I can make this a red box up here. "
"18501890","18506530"," And then they will do a yellow box below it so you can see it better."
"18507890","18510230"," I can relate it to a better fashion."
"18512830","18513230"," Yellow. "
"18514850","18518170"," A little bit more yellow."
"18520450","18521290"," Yellow right here."
"18522310","18525210"," And this one here should be red and red. "
"18526450","18526810"," Like that."
"18528590","18533090"," If I wasn't doing reject and accept, you would do something like this."
"18536090","18539050"," I'm going to do something like, so we're up here now, right?"
"18539230","18540170"," We have the first bloodbath. "
"18541330","18542170"," And let's say you missed it."
"18542250","18543550"," You're like, ah, shucks, I missed it."
"18543650","18552090"," Or even I took it and took money and ran, you'd be looking to buy some puts, buy boots. "
"18556060","18565850"," And you might add to your puts, and you'd"
"18565850","18566690"," stop out of here."
"18568010","18569030"," It stops."
"18573140","18574420"," These are all exchangeable. "
"18574580","18577340"," You can go put your stops up here."
"18578360","18581440"," You can raise your stops up higher, whatever you're most comfortable with."
"18582260","18585840"," Now you can say, well, I'm still not convinced for going down cap. "
"18586440","18587560"," You could just wait right here."
"18588500","18589180"," It puts."
"18590400","18592060"," You could be your stops above right here. "
"18592980","18595920"," If you missed the trade, you're like, ah shit, I missed it this time cap."
"18596660","18597840"," But it still went down."
"18599000","18599940"," Let's say it didn't do that. "
"18600140","18601960"," Let's just say it started raining down."
"18602080","18602580"," You missed the trade."
"18603300","18605460"," You've learned on your own how to sell the market. "
"18605980","18607780"," Like, ah, next time I'm going to buy it right here."
"18608420","18610780"," I'm going to add in case we squeeze higher some more."
"18611260","18612240"," Let's stop right here. "
"18617700","18618240"," Make sense?"
"18621580","18622180"," Now's a bull."
"18622320","18623120"," What are you trying to buy in here?"
"18624140","18625540"," Now, what is a bull trying to buy?"
"18626120","18628980"," A bull is trying to buy calls down here."
"18629880","18634860"," Because we know that some buyers are down there, buy calls here. "
"18638310","18641050"," If we can't get calls down here, what are we looking for up here?"
"18641630","18646310"," We're looking for price to trade above these stops and hold."
"18647270","18653610"," They're looking for price to come up, consolidate, and begin to make move higher."
"18653950","18655310"," So this is where your trade is, the bull. "
"18658950","18664070"," What we'll do is we'll draw a small line right here, just like that."
"18666230","18667390"," And we'll do buy calls."
"18700780","18702380"," Some people will wait for the rejection. "
"18702760","18704360"," This would be the other one, this would be another trade."
"18705040","18705720"," You wait for rejection."
"18707180","18707760"," Get rid of this one. "
"18707960","18708500"," We'll write rejection."
"18709420","18711840"," This would be the second way to do this would be one."
"18713140","18714920"," You wait for the rejection or two. "
"18715040","18716980"," Rejection is what I had on there earlier."
"18719160","18720000"," Rejects are rejection."
"18720520","18721280"," You wait for rejection. "
"18723080","18728660"," And you would wait for, you would wait for puts to come back down here and then you'd buy the"
"18728660","18729660"," puts right here."
"18730560","18731060"," Make sense?"
"18731880","18735700"," A lot of people have their finger on the button for SQQ or they have their finger on the button"
"18735700","18740100"," for socks stuff or inverse socks or whatever."
"18741920","18742560"," Make sense?"
"18745000","18746700"," But there is something that I don't like here. "
"18747640","18755270"," What I don't like is I don't like, I don't like this."
"18756130","18759470"," I don't like, personally I don't like this, this green line coming out."
"18761090","18763270"," Showing the view that they're buying the underlying right now. "
"18764330","18765610"," Buying the fuck out of this dip."
"18784510","18785790"," We'll see how it plays out right now."
"18785890","18787850"," We'll watch it together and see how it plays out. "
"18795390","18802030"," So the one that we're building has, the one that we're building has labels on it that shows one,"
"18802110","18812750"," two, three, four, five clusters and has alerts that say like calls or puts, like"
"18812750","18817810"," long calls, long puts or long market, some kind of verbiage."
"18820930","18829010"," What's crazy too is if it starts to like do this, it's got a high rate of win."
"18831750","18838390"," If it comes here, like this, there's no call right here. "
"18838950","18844610"," But if it starts to come under, you start getting really fucking embarrassed down here, like super"
"18844610","18844910"," bear."
"18849820","18851740"," And this stuff here helps too."
"18852160","18853260"," And then this stuff up here. "
"18853760","18857180"," You can actually see the, we're getting super bullish in here."
"18857540","18858660"," We're buying the fuck out of this."
"18859680","18861520"," See how it says 20 down here. "
"18862300","18863440"," We're not like negative 20."
"18865140","18866560"," We're still bullish here."
"18867880","18869480"," I'll explain more of that again other time. "
"18871900","18872880"," We're buying dips right now."
"18879260","18880940"," We're dip buying not dip selling."
"18897860","18906380"," You would want to see price action come up and start to make that trip higher, slam the buy"
"18906380","18906620"," trigger. "
"18907400","18908880"," And we often run into the bell."
"18929490","18931030"," It's, it actually follows."
"18931750","18935310"," So winky, you're going to have like a, you're going to have something like this winky. "
"18937810","18948850"," It's going to be, so this is going to say, like this one's going to say something"
"18948850","18951530"," like this, right?"
"18955910","18957310"," And it'll follow this along."
"18959370","18960630"," And it'll change colors."
"18960910","18964130"," If I can get it to change colors like it'll be neutral, then it'll turn green. "
"18965210","18968050"," So if we were up here, it would turn green being right there."
"18969190","18970270"," Now it turns green."
"18971950","18972690"," Makes sense. "
"18975830","18976810"," It goes underneath."
"18977570","18978710"," So right now it'd be yellow."
"18981230","18982470"," Right here it'd be like yellow. "
"18984730","18987770"," And if it goes underneath, it's going to turn red."
"18989270","18990210"," I'm just like that."
"18991650","18993630"," That's what I want it to be like red. "
"18994250","18994530"," Makes sense."
"18995430","18996590"," And then you'd have like the cluster."
"18996590","19001750"," So you'd have the one minute yellow right here, currently the yellow. "
"19002450","19004510"," And then the five minute down here with the yellow."
"19005510","19010870"," We'd rename it five minute."
"19015930","19016790"," Something like that. "
"19022460","19022880"," Like this."
"19027760","19030280"," And then right now it's currently yellow."
"19030760","19031120"," No trade. "
"19033520","19036360"," This would say like one hour would be green."
"19037620","19039080"," Four red depending on the velocity."
"19040100","19043720"," Should be able to show you if we're supportive or not. "
"19045020","19047920"," It should be like a little figure down here, not a figure with a velocity trigger."
"19055140","19055940"," It's supportive."
"19057300","19058020"," It's supportive. "
"19064150","19065050"," Something like that."
"19066310","19067730"," Or support or no support."
"19073700","19076340"," Depending upon velocity right there. "
"19077640","19079940"," For no buyers, buyers, no buyers."
"19081220","19081880"," Makes sense."
"19083020","19083780"," Something like that. "
"19084320","19085260"," I don't know exactly what's going to be."
"19085440","19086400"," Guy's working on it right now."
"19090120","19090900"," Something like that. "
"19091580","19093140"," You'd know if you could buy this dip or not."
"19093920","19095580"," You'd know if you could buy this dip or not."
"19095960","19097160"," You'd know if you buy that dip or not. "
"19102500","19105960"," So we can tell in the background with velocity if this dip's going to be bought or not."
"19106200","19107600"," We can tell if it will fail."
"19108780","19110880"," We can tell if it'll fail if they're bought the dip or not. "
"19111700","19112980"," Like can you buy the dip there or not?"
"19113080","19113420"," We can tell."
"19116480","19117260"," Four minute trigger."
"19119180","19120040"," Still would be yellow. "
"19124780","19126240"," This would turn green here in just a minute."
"19129500","19135260"," Turn it green if the white line comes above here in just a minute."
"19136160","19140820"," If this red line comes above, it'll turn green as well. "
"19142620","19143360"," A little price."
"19143780","19144000"," Excuse me."
"19144500","19146720"," Actually, this starts to turn green right now, believe it or not. "
"19147780","19151420"," If this starts to turn down, it'll turn red right now, be yellow."
"19157240","19158000"," Who's winning here?"
"19158220","19159140"," Tell me in the chat who's winning."
"19159980","19161220"," Do we know yet or do we not?"
"19162580","19163860"," I don't have an answer yet who's winning. "
"19170330","19174850"," If you think somebody's winning right now, if you tell me if you think you know who's winning the"
"19174850","19180170"," battle right now, I can't give it to the bulls yet."
"19183850","19186030"," But if you think the bears are winning right here, tell me."
"19188070","19189170"," I think bears are winning right here. "
"19199840","19200860"," Sigma males are winning."
"19201680","19202500"," Yeah, I need to see."
"19203160","19204920"," For me to say bulls are winning, I need to see. "
"19205200","19208160"," I want to know if you guys are understanding this or that's why I'm asking the question."
"19208560","19209740"," I'm not asking you to make it look bad."
"19209840","19210500"," I want to know what you think. "
"19210680","19211000"," What you think?"
"19212500","19218600"," Or here's where I would say bulls if bears are winning, something like that."
"19219420","19220300"," The price was right here."
"19221620","19222780"," I would say bears are winning. "
"19225760","19227040"," Bears would take the trade."
"19228680","19232320"," The trade for bears or the trade as the trade would be."
"19234500","19235880"," You'd wait until you see this. "
"19238810","19240790"," You don't take the bear trade until you see price."
"19246520","19247880"," You want to see price right here."
"19250080","19251180"," That's what you want to see if you're a bear. "
"19251960","19253140"," I'll leave that up right now."
"19255260","19257760"," I thought a bear wants to see."
"19263230","19266550"," It's 3.14. This is the bear trade right here. "
"19267850","19269250"," This is where you buy it right here."
"19279720","19280440"," Down to your head."
"19280920","19281540"," I got you Sparky. "
"19282340","19284420"," I appreciate the honest answer Sparky."
"19285200","19291500"," I trust Sparky is a great trader."
"19311890","19313650"," I don't see either winning right now. "
"19313710","19316870"," I see consolidation."
"19316870","19319890"," If I see a call trade, I'll tell you by calls."
"19322450","19323930"," I don't want you to buy calls. "
"19325570","19332280"," I'm going to say buy calls by calls to see how it goes."
"19344120","19344800"," What news?"
"19346740","19348020"," What kind of recall is it?"
"19348960","19351160"," Is it a recall when they just do a computer thing?"
"19352120","19353380"," Or is it a recall if they take the cars in?"
"19363540","19364640"," What a bear wants?"
"19365100","19365800"," What a bear needs?"
"19373650","19374850"," What a bear wants?"
"19375610","19376530"," What a bear needs?"
"19377490","19384370"," Bring me Mike Burry please to the end of the world because I'm asking you my baby."
"19384850","19388010"," 3.16. We know about 15 minutes right. "
"19388270","19389070"," We know about half an hour."
"19389270","19389990"," We know about the hourly."
"19390670","19391390"," Coming into the hour. "
"19391530","19393450"," We got we got 14 minutes left until the hourly."
"19394550","19396350"," One of these guys are going to have to make it right."
"19396670","19397390"," We got 14 minutes. "
"19397570","19409170"," Find out if the bears"
"19409170","19410130"," still haven't won that."
"19410510","19413030"," They're going to need to break above and they need to consolidate."
"19425040","19426100"," What do we say was?"
"19542470","19549060"," Yeah, I just need to post on fin to it saying so you guys know what I'm talking about here. "
"19550540","19560420"," I wonder if theta wins for Monday and I'm a bit surprised that 420."
"19560420","19560660"," 420."
"19562360","19563080"," So here you go. "
"19563520","19564780"," So right here you want to see a rejection."
"19567620","19573060"," You don't want to see it come down in a rejection and right here would be the bear straight right"
"19573060","19573200"," here."
"19576280","19576780"," I'm going to wait. "
"19576980","19577780"," You want to see the rejection."
"19580440","19584460"," So I was just on fin to it and I was like I just proposed and I said pooch and"
"19584460","19585940"," calls both feet for high low targets."
"19586140","19589380"," 4.24.4 on 3.17 and 3.21.0 pecs. "
"19589480","19590080"," Wonder if theta wins."
"19592000","19593900"," Because they're not pricing it in."
"19594920","19599200"," Dealers are not pricing in high low targets on Monday Tuesday. "
"19600280","19601500"," I'm not pricing it in."
"19602860","19604140"," So I wonder why."
"19615350","19617410"," I keep saying Monday but I mean the 21st. "
"19619370","19659330"," If I say money just regarding I just said 3.21. Do"
"19659330","19659870"," you guys prefer?"
"19660370","19661130"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"19661130","19662690"," I'm going to do a poll real quick."
"19663970","19667710"," Do you prefer that I bounce back and forth between these two charts or no?"
"19668050","19670890"," Would you just like to see the weebel chart?"
"19671090","19672530"," Let me go into the Oscar question. "
"19673410","19674610"," YouTube, studio."
"19676150","19677830"," Let me get a legit answer."
"19679890","19680830"," Okay, let's see. "
"19681930","19682990"," I damn it."
"19683570","19693440"," I don't"
"19693440","19694280"," want to right now."
"19694500","19695180"," Stop this shit. "
"19706290","19707730"," No, I don't want to do this."
"19709250","19710570"," Fucking YouTube man."
"19711010","19711690"," Fucking YouTube. "
"19712710","19713350"," So wonky."
"19720020","19720320"," Not 10."
"19728040","19728540"," Okay. "
"19728540","19728620"," Okay."
"19733740","19735480"," No, I'm not inserting ads here."
"19738640","19739520"," Okay, ready?"
"19740960","19741960"," Engage with my audience. "
"19742760","19743200"," Start a poll."
"19743200","19745860"," Okay."
"19746340","19747160"," What charts?"
"19747960","19749300"," Charts. "
"19752110","19752730"," Question mark."
"19754130","19755550"," Just weebel."
"19761690","19766710"," Both weebel and TV. "
"19768050","19770250"," That option."
"19770770","19771770"," Just TV."
"19774580","19775680"," Option. "
"19776040","19776600"," Don't care."
"19777780","19787670"," Care for the"
"19787670","19789510"," giggles."
"19796520","19799800"," And to fade you. "
"19802210","19803400"," And it paid you, bro."
"19804280","19810650"," Oh, I can't write page, bro."
"19816060","19817180"," Here we go. "
"19817180","19819160"," All right."
"19824370","19824590"," Here we go."
"19824650","19824970"," And ask me. "

"20200840","20202240"," Okay, happy, happy care. "
"20203080","20205720"," 61% say, uh, both Webull and TV."
"20206360","20213160"," Uh, so just TV, 16% here for the giggles, and they love percent right on just Webull, 10%."
"20213160","20214880"," That's pretty, pretty firm answer right here. "
"20215360","20218760"," Uh, so you see right now that bears are losing the spite right now."
"20219820","20222260"," All right, they're getting stopped out right here, right?"
"20222600","20227460"," You can see the, see the stops getting triggered right now on puts and on shorts, trying to, trying"
"20227460","20230240"," to stop out the bearish move here."
"20230900","20234440"," Um, and so the, the bulls are starting to win here. "
"20235180","20237900"," Uh, you're actually starting, well, you started, yeah, it's kind of neutral."
"20238800","20243000"," Uh, so now I'm looking down here at this hourly chart and it's getting kind of neutral, right?"
"20243520","20246480"," We couldn't have just trading this into 330 right now, right?"
"20247140","20248980"," Uh, so we had three, so we're at 330."
"20249080","20254320"," Remember I told you every 15 minutes and we're coming into the half hour and the bulls are starting"
"20254320","20257260"," to win and the bears are starting to lose, right?"
"20257500","20258160"," On the half hour. "
"20258740","20259820"," So it's 330 PM."
"20260060","20260940"," Who do you expect to win now?"
"20261060","20261400"," The bulls."
"20262100","20264400"," The bulls are going to start winning this, right?"
"20264660","20265700"," You're going to flip over to calls. "
"20266700","20269660"," If you had a robot right now, you could probably do this quickly, right?"
"20270560","20274600"," Just get out of the puts, trigger the puts, get out of them, you buy the calls and you start"
"20274600","20275680"," looking to go higher now."
"20275680","20276880"," And here we go."
"20277200","20279540"," The bulls are winning, right?"
"20280420","20286960"," Uh, and we're triggering now that the high here at 413.05, we have another high above, uh, 413.52"
"20286960","20292080"," and the bulls are going to try to slam it home into this close for the next 15 minutes at"
"20292080","20297080"," least, uh, probably until 340 at a minimum, possibly even 345. "
"20298360","20301760"," Okay, so bears, bears stops are triggered here, right?"
"20302180","20306100"," And so you've got buyers of the market stepping in, right?"
"20306200","20310080"," You'll probably have some call buyers stepping in now and they're going to want to beat this right"
"20310080","20310320"," here."
"20310500","20312920"," 413.05. They're going to want to come back and attack."
"20314120","20315380"," Uh, let's see here. "
"20317690","20323170"," I'm going to come up here and try to attack this for 413.51. Unreal, watching this buying going on"
"20323170","20323530"," right now."
"20324410","20324810"," Unreal."
"20327730","20331270"," Uh, well, I'll give you my take when I think it's going to happen on the bell without even looking"
"20331270","20331590"," at this. "
"20332930","20334430"," So crazy, right?"
"20335110","20339110"," Bull's defending the long trade higher, right?"
"20339270","20341210"," Bull's are saying, Nope, we're going higher."
"20341230","20347730"," We're going to try to attack that 420 almost like the same setup on, uh, on, um, CPI, right?"
"20348350","20350170"," Uh, this is where they kind of fuck you over."
"20350350","20355350"," One quick thing though, uh, calls for tomorrow for the 16th. "
"20356050","20356710"," Look at them."
"20357910","20359290"," They're very expensive, right?"
"20359630","20360350"," Like a 420 call."
"20360550","20362150"," That's only seven cents for a 420 call. "
"20362710","20367150"," This isn't like, you remember all the options money that was in the market earlier in the week?"
"20367570","20368650"," We had $4 zero dates."
"20369790","20373570"," Now they're $1.72. So really, really low price, right?"
"20373790","20375890"," Not $4 in the money calls for tomorrow."
"20377090","20378990"," And they're even cheaper for the 21st. "
"20380010","20387770"," Uh, so that's my call for this week is the, the call for this week is, um, 422 C for"
"20387770","20393790"," 21st and 404 C for the 17th, I think, for 26 cents."
"20394610","20395970"," I think that was for the 17th, right?"
"20396610","20396610"," Yeah."
"20398930","20402090"," Let's look at the, uh, let's see what they, let's see what they cost, 58 cents. "
"20402910","20404710"," Uh, just right now, let's look and see what they cost."
"20408680","20418230"," Uh, so with the 17th, uh, we've got 404s are now"
"20418230","20418750"," ready."
"20419070","20420850"," 404s are now 26 cents. "
"20425510","20429410"," And, uh, oh, sorry."
"20429670","20432750"," They're the same price for 26 cents still."
"20434170","20435550"," Nothing's changed in the put side. "
"20436470","20439030"," Uh, 404 Cs for the 21st."
"20447260","20449900"," They're now 52 cents, 52 cents."
"20450920","20451580"," They're up 20 cents. "
"20452000","20453900"," So right now I'm up 20 cents in that trade."
"20454500","20455780"," The trade was 58 cents."
"20456000","20457200"," It's now 78 cents. "
"20458120","20458520"," Okay."

"20563730","20566210"," I promised I would do CVS for you guys out there."
"20566210","20566670"," So we'll do it. "
"20566790","20569150"," Oh, I promised I'd do a shop earlier, right?"
"20569770","20573490"," Does anybody still want to see shop and tweet Twilio into the bell?"
"20573630","20574810"," You guys want some targets on that?"
"20577580","20578660"," You've got half an hour."
"20578800","20579400"," I can do Twilio."
"20581080","20586800"," Yeah, that was way, way earlier. "
"20591020","20591480"," Okay."

"20660940","20663160"," I like this, I like this consolidation down here."
"20663180","20663520"," I like this. "
"20664500","20670320"," Uh, but I think it's dangerous right in here."
"20672240","20673960"," Uh, so you can take this trade."
"20674180","20675440"," Yes, I'm agreeing with that. "
"20675440","20681480"," Uh, but I would get out of that trade and wait to reenter above now."
"20683080","20684760"," Um, I'm not like crazy."
"20684880","20689260"," Like you can't like see like, oh, by the way, each rating starts going to talk to you about a"
"20689260","20690060"," fucking rocket. "
"20690400","20695200"," I'm going to talk to your rocket and the shit we were talking about."
"20695560","20697860"," And I got more shit about rocket."
"20698220","20699420"," Did you hear about the diapers, dude?"
"20700260","20702020"," Did you hear about the fucking diapers shit?"
"20703380","20705880"," I got a bunch of shit to tell these trading shorts. "
"20706820","20715240"," Uh, so, uh, I'm, I'm game on with polls here, but I'm not like, I would love to buy rocket,"
"20715240","20723520"," like right here, not rocket CVS, like above 80, 89 40 or so in a successful hold, like right in"
"20723520","20723720"," here."
"20724000","20725380"," I would love that fucking trade."
"20725920","20727160"," That's a great trade. "
"20728140","20728840"," Big money."
"20730180","20731100"," Big money."
"20731420","20739400"," It's probably going to need, it's probably going to need, um, it's probably going to need like,"
"20739720","20742200"," it's called 80 50. "
"20744860","20748880"," Probably going to need some consolidation like this right here."
"20750800","20752900"," And, uh, let's look at it on a bigger timeline."
"20754800","20758380"," I give it, if it gets, if it gets above these two numbers right here, you guys come back and"
"20758380","20760660"," check this out, uh, later on. "
"20763260","20765440"," I would love to see like rejection."
"20766280","20767440"," I don't sing in here."
"20767760","20769140"," Bam, bam, bam. "
"20769880","20772500"," And then, bam, then, boom."
"20773900","20774680"," Right there."
"20774980","20778380"," Oh, something like that. "
"20779180","20784240"," But I don't want to see this, uh, some shit like this, bam."
"20784920","20786720"," And then market, sell, boom."
"20789870","20790950"," I don't want to see that. "
"20796050","20798150"," Dude, that would be monster right there."
"20800250","20800990"," Super monster."
"20801390","20803010"," So I'll get some polls from CVS briefly. "
"20803790","20808530"," And I'm bullish on CVS above, uh, 82 or 89 bucks, 90 bucks, maybe."
"20808850","20809730"," Do you even call it 90?"
"20810210","20812130"," Do you bullish above 90 or so?"
"20813490","20814090"," Something like that."
"20815490","20816330"," Now Shopify. "
"20819330","20821110"," Oh, we've got ER for Shopify."
"20821330","20821970"," Oh, Jesus."
"20824730","20828470"," My, my, my Shopify, Shopify, Shopify. "
"20828670","20829890"," Ooh, right there."
"20830090","20830530"," Shopify."
"20830750","20830870"," Ooh. "
"20831950","20833250"," I'm going to get Shopify in the background."
"20839400","20840920"," All the news, talking shit."
"20842600","20844140"," Money doesn't care about news. "
"20846160","20846680"," Get Shopify."
"20850100","20851900"," Shopify just cranking into the bell."
"20853460","20854920"," My God, Shopify. "
"20856680","20859400"," Uh, I'm going to go with a big no and Shopify."
"20863290","20863930"," 350."
"20864470","20866370"," It got blasted, right?"
"20867590","20867590"," 353. "
"20871630","20872270"," Jesus."
"20873330","20876290"," Dude, Shopify is, you guys seen the gap on Shopify?"
"20876910","20879130"," Gap on Shopify is the same."
"20881710","20883950"," How can you go wrong on Shopify?"
"20886050","20888310"," How can you go wrong on Shopify?"
"20890110","20891430"," How can you go wrong?"
"20892370","20894310"," Uh, buy levels on Shopify. "
"20895510","20896890"," 4850, 4881."
"20900500","20902060"," I'm bullish on Shopify."
"20904620","20906280"," 5093 into your ER. "
"20909020","20910500"," Um, Shop."
"20917590","20919290"," I'm actually bullish on Shopify here."
"20920710","20921310"," Shopify. "
"20923090","20923690"," 4890."
"20926410","20928470"," Let me get the camera to this here for a minute."
"20931050","20933670"," So Shopify, let's look at Shop into the bell. "
"20938690","20939450"," Okay."
"20944460","20950300"," Shopify, I'm a buyer at, uh, 40."
"20950580","20951380"," Whoa, 93. "
"20953240","20965330"," 5093 here, right"
"20999730","21000010"," there."
"21032650","21033830"," Big buyer down in here."
"21034370","21036490"," Big buyer, Shopify, anything down in here?"
"21037010","21052470"," Uh, upside targets, moon, straight moon,"
"21057150","21065340"," straight bucket moonshot. "
"21078840","21081960"," 765, 70 bucks, 85 bucks."
"21082940","21084800"," Definitely on the table, depending on what they say."
"21086100","21087520"," Um, definitely. "
"21087520","21092440"," Uh, what's crazy is their implied move is 57 on the high and 48 below."
"21093780","21095880"," It'd make for a great strangle down the road."
"21098160","21103260"," It'd make for an, it'd make for an awesome strangle farther down the road. "
"21103700","21104240"," Month out."
"21105120","21107080"," Look for some dirt she puts at 40 bucks."
"21107300","21108840"," Look for some, uh, dirt looking again now. "
"21108940","21113500"," So the early mark strong close imbalance still sitting at 526 million to the south side."
"21113720","21121240"," Dude, this is all like, all of this up here is, uh, gap to close above."
"21121400","21123160"," This dream is sponsored by to the top. "
"21123180","21123940"," Shopify could move."
"21124200","21127120"," It's free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels."
"21127120","21128400"," It's not pricing up. "
"21128620","21132080"," I don't like the pricing in a Shopify on both ends."
"21132660","21133200"," Put saying calls."
"21133220","21137780"," I don't like the, I don't, I wouldn't do it for tomorrow, but, uh, I think the price is going"
"21137780","21141260"," to move on Shopify, uh, TWTL. "
"21143960","21145640"," Watch this be the one that doesn't move."
"21146200","21150360"," But I think we're not, uh, I think Shopify is underrated for a move."
"21151140","21152000"," Watch it not move. "
"21152700","21153800"," We usually do a fairly good job."
"21153900","21154760"," I don't miss too many of these."
"21156520","21157880"," We'll do a TWTL. "
"21161880","21162760"," Um, me yellow."
"21167410","21173910"," Uh, I'm not even gonna, at Shopify, I'm not even gonna put the, um, the expected move on Shopify"
"21173910","21175890"," because I don't believe the expected move at all."
"21176410","21177210"," I think it's gonna move. "
"21177210","21181270"," I think the expected move is 57 bucks and 41 dollars."
"21181590","21187770"," I could be wrong on that, but I think that, I think that anything below in Shopify, any, any kind"
"21187770","21190950"," of dip below to 40 bucks is a buy."
"21191730","21197230"," If you're long Shopify already, if you bought the bottom on Shopify moon, baby, you bet you're"
"21197230","21199630"," hoping on a moon, uh, if not now, then later. "
"21202010","21211710"," Uh, and I'll tell you this, uh, your, um, stops are below, believe it or not, stops are below"
"21211710","21213170"," 41 dollars."
"21213830","21217290"," So your true stops are, if you're like an underlying holder, that's your stops."
"21217770","21219230"," Like way down there is your stops. "
"21220430","21221670"," 40 bucks, maybe."
"21222950","21228070"," If you're a dip buyer on, uh, on Twilio, it's way down here."
"21229070","21231390"," There's buyer, there's demand down here guaranteed demand. "
"21232590","21237930"," Uh, if you break through 40 bucks on, on Shopify, uh, dude, get the fuck out."
"21238070","21238930"," That means your demand is gone."
"21240630","21247010"," Uh, Twilio, implied move, $72.90, 57 bucks. "
"21256470","21257970"," Uh, tough one to call."
"21259710","21260890"," Uh, Twilio."
"21298620","21303360"," Okay, so Twilio, right, uh, right here. "
"21307590","21320330"," Uh, 62, 63, right there,"
"21320330","21330270"," 58, 73, these Twilio buyers are like, uh,"
"21330450","21331010"," Tesla buyers."
"21331230","21331930"," They don't go buy anything."
"21333550","21334990"," Twilio buyers are buying the way down. "
"21335170","21335890"," They'll buy it on the way up."
"21336010","21336330"," They don't care."
"21338510","21341350"," Twilio buyers have been like, I've been long since 2020 and March. "
"21342550","21343730"," I never sell one."
"21346210","21348090"," Twilio buyers just don't care, do they?"
"21351420","21352680"," 67, 11."
"21355060","21355620"," Wow. "
"21356860","21357540"," Here you go."
"21362010","21363230"," Here's gonna be a weird one."
"21363950","21365350"," Here's a weird one on Twilio. "
"21366710","21378030"," So at 67, 11, it's"
"21378030","21378750"," a scary one."
"21379910","21381790"," Uh, there are crazy sellers here."
"21382550","21388990"," Now, if you go above, there's gonna be on, uh, buyers above. "
"21405150","21405750"," Goddamn it."
"21409730","21415010"," We're looking now to the market-on-close imbalance, currently sitting at 441 million to the buy"
"21415010","21416690"," side, just waiting for those final orders now."
"21419440","21422800"," Market-on-close imbalance, 449 million to the buy side. "
"21423060","21427400"," So that's the market-on-close imbalance for the NYSE, 449 million to buy."
"21427720","21428860"," Big sellers right here too."
"21429380","21430020"," Squeeze above. "
"21431580","21433240"," And there's buyers down here."
"21433240","21436480"," We're on our 10 minutes away from the top of the hour, where we do see the release of the"
"21436480","21438940"," New Zealand government, six-month financial statement."
"21439480","21445640"," This time, we do also get the US overall net capital flows, forecast 165 billion from the prior 213"
"21445640","21452080"," spot 1 billion, as well as the US take long-term transactions, sort of a prior rate of 171 spot"
"21452080","21452700"," 5 billion. "
"21452920","21453860"," This one's very volatile."
"21454320","21456480"," Twilio is like, obscenely volatile here."
"21456480","21460360"," There's a very dangerous ticket we're playing in the close. "
"21462500","21464080"," Very, very dangerous."
"21466060","21467210"," Make sure that you have..."
"21468960","21474200"," I wouldn't be surprised to see like, you know, slam down, buy above, stuff like that."
"21483870","21488590"," So like, this is a very volatile thing, right?"
"21488950","21491370"," Sellers are going to try to come in and slam this down on the close. "
"21492570","21496790"," But if demand is higher, it's going to squeeze like a monster."
"21498930","21500990"," Like a monster on Twilio."
"21501550","21502810"," Let me look above and see. "
"21508810","21512570"," Yeah, it's going to squeeze like, see this is going to squeeze like, insaneo."
"21512830","21513950"," These are two good calls."
"21514690","21518410"," Whoever called these out earlier, these are like, live and die by the sword calls. "
"21520190","21522150"," You see this gap got closed already?"
"21523030","21526890"," I mean, I'd personally, I'd like to see consolidation on Twilio."
"21527470","21534510"," If it's a good ER, damn it."
"21535210","21538110"," But you know, this isn't what these guys trade this for. "
"21538650","21540990"," These guys trade this ship for the squeeze, right?"
"21541230","21541430"," For the memes."
"21548130","21554910"," But if you get a squeeze, 72.92, I'd like to see, you know, all this stuff needs work here."
"21555070","21555990"," Like, there's a lot of work here. "
"21556170","21557730"," A lot of work needs done on Twilio."
"21558030","21559930"," These are all these sellers that I'm talking about."
"21559930","21561870"," They're all just sitting here waiting to sell. "
"21563670","21570950"," If you want to squeeze Twilio, it's going to be above 110.71. This is like where big squeezes"
"21570950","21571390"," happen."
"21571590","21573590"," Above 110.71. Do I think you're going there today?"
"21573590","21574110"," Probably not."
"21575230","21576350"," Three to two, eight minutes left. "
"21577270","21581550"," I don't see it happening today, but I do want you to know that they're, you know, some heavy"
"21581550","21584050"," sellers here, heavy sellers above."
"21584310","21587210"," They're trying to like, they're trying to sell that."
"21587370","21588910"," Like they've been, they've been stuck for how long?"
"21588910","21590070"," They just want to get out of this. "
"21590530","21595430"," So you've got, you've got like, sellers above just begging to get out of their, their longs on"
"21595430","21595810"," Twilio."
"21596210","21597610"," Probably been trapped for months."
"21598510","21599870"," They just want to get the fuck out. "
"21600650","21606750"," But if you get above 100 at any point, not this 78, not that name, 95 are right there."
"21607530","21610830"," If you ever get above that 110, you get a lot of work to do in here."
"21610910","21616630"," But if you get through all this shit at some point, it's going to be on like Donkey Kong, like"
"21616630","21618170"," on above 110. "
"21619030","21620990"," I can't say much other than that on Twilio."
"21621050","21622070"," It's, it's a dangerous trade."
"21623750","21629410"," I think any squeezes you get above here are going to be met with sellers on Twilio. "
"21629590","21632150"," But great trade for a great, a great ticker to be looking at into the bell."
"21633950","21636130"," Do you guys want to watch the both of these into the bell?"
"21636290","21637630"," We can watch them both and see what happens."
"21639690","21642850"," Right here, right here. "
"21643910","21645230"," Great, great trades to watch."
"21646630","21647690"," I'm not going to lie with you."
"21649470","21649950"," Shopify. "
"21651150","21652670"," I'm down to sit around for this one."
"21653230","21655630"," Let me get a bear and I'll bear with you guys."
"21657790","21664230"," I'd love to see a price target above if you squeeze 78, 92. "
"21666090","21667530"," Put that right there for you."
"21669650","21674650"," I don't believe the options marked on either of these, by the way, they're mispriced."
"21675330","21677310"," Both tickers in my view are mispriced. "
"21686110","21687030"," Up and down."
"21687250","21688870"," Only it matters if it goes up or down."
"21689070","21690250"," They're mispriced on both sides. "
"21697400","21698440"," Boil and UNG."
"21699000","21701260"," Let me look at Boil and UNG right now for you."
"21703470","21707570"," You got the Wendy's traders on Boil and you got the Applebee's traders, right?"
"21708910","21715330"," UNG, high pollutant traders on, so Boil. "
"21715610","21717530"," It's been out five minutes away from the top of the app."
"21717570","21720770"," For the release of the overall net capital flows for the US."
"21722050","21725330"," 4x165 billion prior to 113 spot 1 billion. "
"21725690","21730710"," Full as the US tick long term transactions, which saw a prior rate of 171 spot 5 billion."
"21731090","21734430"," So you got this, we get the release of the New Zealand government six month financial."
"21734770","21736410"," So you've got some problems here. "
"21736510","21737910"," You've got a good bounce here on Boil."
"21738630","21741910"," You need to get above 608 right now."
"21742070","21743290"," Basically, you need to get above 608. "
"21743590","21744110"," I got to Peter."
"21745710","21747550"," Boil 608, you need to get above."
"21749270","21753150"," Price target for me, you have to hold it right with the one minute trigger that I give to you"
"21753150","21754270"," guys on a one minute chart. "
"21755090","21760850"," You need to get above right here and you'll get to 628 right here."
"21761870","21765270"," Come back again, Peter tomorrow and we'll look at Boil again."
"21765510","21766770"," It's not ready if you're wondering. "
"21767690","21771390"," I don't like Boil like this because it can keep heading lower."
"21772250","21776470"," I would like to buy Boil once it gets above and the one minute chart gets up there with it."
"21776470","21779330"," You'll have your two, you'll have your three triggers move higher. "
"21779890","21781790"," There's the three trigger cluster that'll come up."
"21783130","21784710"," Don't tip me tomorrow, nothing Peter."
"21784950","21787910"," Just show up in the morning or something and be like, Hey man, look at Boil for me. "
"21788410","21789550"," Please now remember you."
"21790090","21791090"," It's almost there."
"21791170","21791770"," It's not quite there. "
"21791850","21793310"," You don't want to see this roll over here."
"21794270","21796390"," You don't want to be long here in Boil either."
"21796950","21801930"," UNG, same deal on UNG. "
"21802410","21807410"," UNG price target above 858, but you must get above 845."
"21807410","21809350"," You're at 843 right now."
"21809750","21812970"," You have to get above 845 and you need to see these triggers. "
"21813610","21818930"," The better trade on Boil or UNG and Boil is to get above 858."
"21821130","21822670"," This is actually the better trade."
"21823490","21827810"," So if you follow me real quick, okay, you really want to see, is you really want to see price"
"21827810","21830430"," come up here, kind of hang out. "
"21830990","21832090"," You want to see that happen."
"21832370","21834330"," And then you want to see the five and the one minute come up."
"21835170","21837110"," And this right here is the bad boy. "
"21837850","21840350"," This will moon straight up."
"21842090","21848690"," So even even the work that's done in here, Peter, it's probably better to be looking currently for"
"21848690","21851290"," 860 on UNG."
"21851910","21853010"," It's the better trade. "
"21853210","21858990"," You might miss part of the trade, but truthfully, the better trade is above like the monster trade,"
"21859330","21864050"," the one where it just cranks and the same thing goes for Boil."
"21864130","21865550"," It's somewhere around 627."
"21865550","21872910"," And even when it hits 627, it can reject and you might have to wait for a velocity to catch"
"21872910","21874970"," up for that squeeze to take place. "
"21875450","21876030"," So how about this?"
"21876510","21881290"," If we get to 627 and Boil, come find me into like, Hey Cap, we're at like six bucks, six"
"21881290","21881690"," dollars."
"21882530","21883970"," We've been fucking around over there."
"21884610","21885730"," Can you look at it for me?"
"21889530","21890170"," Who won?"
"21890990","21893270"," Did the bulls win or did the bulls not win?"
"21894270","21894930"," Did the bulls win?"
"21895130","21898030"," Tell me, tell me, did the bulls win?"
"21900110","21901390"," Did the bulls win?"
"21903970","21905710"," Did the bulls win that fight?"
"21906010","21906690"," Who won that fight?"
"21907890","21909010"," The bulls won. "
"21910710","21913170"," The bulls won that fight, didn't they?"
"21913990","21917030"," Now trading for 1367 right now."
"21918670","21920690"," I didn't tell you the rules about once you win."
"21920850","21923070"," That comes back in checks, but it's still a bull trade. "
"21925110","21929400"," I didn't tell you that."
"21929460","21930200"," I should have told you that earlier."
"21930480","21931460"," You'll come back and recheck that. "
"21931460","21932500"," We did that earlier, right?"
"21932820","21934600"," Came back down and checked the one minute."
"21934600","21935380"," We were off and running."
"21935660","21936260"," See you later. "
"21939780","21940560"," See you later."
"21941600","21942540"," Bull's won, baby."
"21944460","21949920"," The moment they won that, the moment they won, earlier when we were showing that, even if they come"
"21949920","21951340"," back and check, bulls won. "
"21955160","21956600"," I'm losing my voice here."
"21961770","21962390"," Bull's won."
"21963870","21966170"," Twilio looks like it wants to sell right on the bell, doesn't it?"
"21967610","21968310"," Twilio, man. "
"21968690","21969390"," Sketchy here."
"21969890","21971430"," If I was long, Twilio, I'd be out."
"21971710","21972430"," I'll be honest with you. "

"21975490","21978990"," If you're in Twilio right now, just take the money and run, man."
