"TcHcD_r6hxk","82520","89680"," My hair, my hair is looking pretty nice, isn't it?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","89680","96360"," Is there a, do you have a land connection over there that I can plug into real quick?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","96360","97360"," Aaron?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","97360","100360"," How are you all doing?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","100360","102360"," Is there a land connection?"

"TcHcD_r6hxk","137160","143880"," kind of craziness and so I figured out, I figured I wear a hat every week when I did"

"TcHcD_r6hxk","170800","174960"," a more permanent office space with a studio or something I think I'm not sure."

"TcHcD_r6hxk","197920","202000"," I need to get the some data, just all kinds of nonsense."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","202000","204720"," It's more work than I thought it would be."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","204720","206640"," I thought it would be simple."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","206640","210400"," You guys, see if you guys can see me."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","210400","216600"," Let me turn this on."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","216600","217600"," Yeah let's just drink."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","217600","220040"," We're going to talk, we're going to talk about a couple of things."

"TcHcD_r6hxk","224040","227680"," So this will at least be on, this will at least be on recording."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","227680","230160"," I want to give a shout out to you guys."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","230160","235920"," A lot of you guys are out there supporting me, you guys are supporting me by just saying"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","235920","236920"," thank you."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","236920","242720"," The big one right there is just saying thank you or asking questions, even discussing"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","242720","244280"," things amongst each other."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","244280","249000"," I always like to see you guys inside of the posts that I make, talking to each other,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","249000","251120"," and trying to help each other along."

"TcHcD_r6hxk","255440","259880"," each other along your trading journeys is the way the retail should do it, right?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","259880","261440"," So that's important."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","262440","269480"," It's some of you guys, I put a tip cup out and some of you guys have tipped me to help"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","269480","273680"," pay for these services and I need to roll more of these services out for you guys."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","273680","278240"," So I want to see that book map come into play more frequently, some kind of a live stream"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","278240","282760"," channel so that you guys can actually see it just running all the time."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","282760","287040"," If you guys want to tune into that during the cash session so that you can see where"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","287040","291280"," the big money is in the market, if we're following, if you can see the big money because we'll"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","291280","295120"," be looping in, or if you're seeing the sellers, the volatility, if they're coming"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","295120","300400"," into sell, wherever your position is, I think I'm just going to keep it on the spy for the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","300400","301400"," day."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","301400","303440"," So at least it shows the whole market."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","303440","310000"," If there's some big moments in another index, I can switch it during those days, but I can"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","310000","314120"," put that stuff up for you live at least, or I can even put like some order flow stuff"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","314120","321880"," up live along with that maybe so that you can see the live flow as they come through"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","321880","326600"," and I'm working on some classes, that stuff, all this stuff will be free, but I want to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","326600","327600"," thank a few people."

"TcHcD_r6hxk","509920","516480"," spreadsheet, it's a lot of people. I'm beside myself knowing that, okay, but really I'm beside"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","516480","523280"," myself. You guys make me want to cry. So I want to say thanks to all of you out there."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","523920","528880"," I hope I'm making a difference for all of you in your, in your trading journey."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","530480","536240"," I want to put some classes out for all of you. I'm starting to make these classes. I'm building"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","536240","541920"," a, like a portfolio of classes, starts from the beginning. You know, I was thinking to myself the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","541920","549120"," other day that even if you ask a long time trainer, sometimes what's the difference between a share"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","549120","553920"," and a stock, we might, we forget sometimes. So we're just going to start at that basic,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","555360","561760"," that basic thing. What's a stock? What's a share? And we'll just do quick videos."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","562640","568560"," I'll explain more in depth, the concepts I'm talking about in a dumb down way. Oftentimes I"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","568560","574400"," try to speak so we can keep things dumb down. We overcomplicate how we trade and we get good"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","574480","582240"," on rabbit holes. And it skews our viewpoint when things, when things are chaotic or there's lots"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","582240","587600"," of volatility in the market. And so sometimes it's simpler to just slow things down, right?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","588560","592080"," So let me put my glasses back on a second, read everything you guys are doing."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","593920","599760"," Yeah, that was a lot of, that was a lot of names. Okay, I got white claw. You guys bought me a bear,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","599760","603760"," right? I bought a four pack of these. I think, I don't know, was it six pack, whatever was like"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","603760","609120"," this big. I don't drink these things. Every week I'm trying to do something different for"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","609120","612800"," y'all. One week we'll just do soda water or something. And if any of you guys are out there"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","612800","617280"," cracking a bear, pouring yourself a bourbon, glass of wine, this is now the time, okay?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","617920","622240"," I want to drink one with you guys. I want to thank you guys. The week is over, right?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","623200","626560"," The week is over. This is a really challenging week. So we're going to crack this thing. I'm not"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","626560","633600"," shotgun in this one. So there you go. I cracked it. Tap, tap. Chairs to all of you out there."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","634480","639440"," I hope you're all safe, well, happy. Your families are safe, your friends. You guys get to see"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","639440","643600"," everybody that you love. If you guys don't have anyone in your lives that you can see,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","643600","647520"," I know that I'm here with you. If you guys, if you all, any of you want to reach out to me"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","647520","650560"," during the holiday season, if you're any of you ever lonely or something like that,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","651520","655840"," just want someone to talk to. My door is always open, you know? Well, you guys"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","655840","659600"," don't know that. I know it can be like that sometimes. I know some of you like being alone,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","659600","663920"," too. So, you know, if you ever want to give a shout out late night or something, let me know."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","663920","665200"," So here's to you, okay?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","673440","679040"," It's burped. Excuse me. Here's to you. Is this good?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","681440","689440"," Yeah, the White Claw party. So, you know, I apologize on Twitter yesterday because I"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","689440","697600"," made a video where I was ripping on Ellie Wave guys and Derek Kourtney is someone that I follow"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","697600","703120"," on Twitter. I really appreciate everything about that guy. So this one's to Derek because I apologize."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","703120","707600"," It wasn't geared towards Derek. I'll tell you guys what it was about. So I apologize, Derek."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","707600","714160"," Hope that you can forgive me. There you go. It was, it was, there was a guy that wrote an"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","714160","721520"," article on MarketWatch a couple days ago. And it was really bad. It was doom and gloom. The"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","721520","725520"," market went up. If you were a bear and you got caught in that, you wouldn't have even survived"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","725520","733040"," today. So it just bothered me that, that I know that there are reporters out there that"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","733840","740320"," are paid to push news stories that really impact us as retail."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","741280","746560"," And so I was just upset at that. And I really apologize. So if he, I don't know if he's watching,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","746560","750400"," I think he watched last night's video. So I'm just here to say, I apologize, Derek."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","753120","757200"," Okay, so let's, let's talk about some stuff here. Okay, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","757200","760400"," I'm gonna make this really brief and then we'll just have a cool conversation."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","760480","765120"," But I just want to give you guys a real quick wrap up for the week. And I want to talk to you"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","765120","769360"," about the clothes today. I want to talk to you about the moves the past couple days."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","770240","775520"," And what it all means, I want you guys to figure some of this out for yourselves."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","777280","781280"," Because I know that it's a challenge sometimes where it's so much going on. You've got news,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","781280","787680"," you've got social media, you've got your own research, you've got events, all this stuff going on."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","787760","791440"," And so sometimes you're doing all this due diligence in the background,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","791440","796160"," and you'll sometimes you'll see me make simple charts. And so you do all this due diligence,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","796160","803280"," then you make yourself a simple chart with classic charting. And if that classic charting fits what"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","803280","809600"," that news is, you know, it starts to, the puzzle starts to come together. So we're going to look"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","809600","814800"," at something about this week. So, so you guys can just have us have a look at what I'm trying to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","814800","819040"," express to you during the day. Okay, now we didn't get that close that I wanted."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","819040","824640"," Today I was pretty upset at that. We did get close to that 465 early in the day twice, I think."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","826080","830800"," I wanted to, well, I wanted to buy in that clothes today. I bought a bunch of crap from"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","830800","836240"," the past two days. But I did end up buying that clothes today and we'll explain to you why here"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","836240","843280"," in just a moment. We'll make this really quick. Okay. So right here I have, well, white clothes"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","843360","845600"," got a lot of crap in it. Cheers again, boys and girls."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","849360","856960"," So let's just, right now we're done. Good to see all you guys. Dylan, Jarkin, Ritesh, Jill."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","858400","865200"," All right, so we're going to make this quick. So I want you to look here. This is the spy"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","866080","873360"," during OPEX of last year. And this, this is the seventh, this is the beginning of the month."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","873360","878240"," And then you can see that we can, we sold down until the 11th. Then this is OPEX right here."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","878240","886400"," We wound up selling down after the, or in the 21st we sold down between the 20th and 21st."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","887120","892080"," And then this was that Friday into Monday. Okay. So we end up coming up on Friday"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","892880","900320"," into the end of OPEX. We moved up, but I wanted you to see that for what I'm going to show you next."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","900320","908480"," Okay. I want to show you guys this OPEX here. And what's important about this month and what's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","908480","914240"," important about the levels that we talk about where the volatility is. I want you to see as far"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","914240","921280"," back as the beginning of November. Okay. Instead, just start to think in a basic sense. Okay. So"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","921360","927520"," right here on the third, would you have bought puts here or would you have gone short the market?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","927520","934080"," That's my question to you. Would you have gone short here on the 10th or bought puts?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","935440","941920"," Would you have gone short here on the 26th or how about the 30th? Even here, let's say this"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","941920","946560"," close right here that we had, right? Would you have bought more puts down here in this close? No."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","947120","952560"," Would you have bought more puts after we broke through down here? No. Right."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","952560","958000"," Same thing goes for taking longs. Would you have taken a long above here? No. Would you have taken"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","958000","965040"," a long above here? No. If we didn't know about this top peak, we had it down here. Would you have"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","965040","969360"," taken the long here? No. Would you have taken the long up here? No. Would you have taken a long"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","969360","974240"," up here? No. Right. So that gives you some answers. So let's just look right now what's going on in"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","974240","980000"," the market, right? You wouldn't have bought, went short here. You would have been closing your"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","980000","984480"," shorts here, right? You'd be trying to close your shorts somewhere before you even get to that line."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","984480","989360"," We have another point here. You wouldn't have gone short. You wouldn't have gone short here."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","989360","995920"," You wouldn't have gone short yesterday or today. You can see today right here. We tagged right"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","995920","1001920"," down here. You wouldn't have gone short today. And the same, the same applies for the tops here."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1002000","1008960"," And this actually took place back here on the 16th. This took place on the 16th, right? 15th,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1008960","1014640"," the 16th, some of us lost money. So we're like, oh, we're going to hold through this volatility."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1014640","1020640"," We're going to hold through into the next level. And you can kind of start playing the pieces together"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1021200","1025440"," seeing where you should be holding and where you should be selling, right? So if you're going to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1025440","1032240"," take a short in here or along in this expanding megaphone, you know where your safety is as a"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1032240","1039520"," bull and a bear. So if we're looking at the clothes today and you were to just go back and just here,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1039520","1049520"," just in this area here, you would have made more money by closing whenever we came into this upper"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1049520","1056240"," or lower channel of volatility. And these call and put walls, right? So generally speaking,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1056720","1062880"," most of the time, if you had closed your long or short within this broadening wedge or this"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1062880","1071120"," expanding megaphone, you would be safe, okay? So now you can say, hey, this one time, I think"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1071120","1076800"," we're going to break below next week into Monday. And that is possible. We can always break through"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1076800","1085520"," on Monday. But the reality is, if you've already won 20 times within one of these expanding wedges,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1085520","1090320"," whatever you want to call it, it's already a expanding wedge, more of a megaphone. Let's say the last"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1090320","1098000"," 20 times you really couldn't lose, and you lost once, you still did better than most participants"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1098000","1103280"," in the market. And so that's the point that I'm trying to express to you when we're trading is,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1103280","1110960"," or investing, is what's the trend in the market? Are we in a negative or positive gamma area? Where"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1110960","1116960"," is negative gamma? That's down here right now. It's below this 4600. This is where if you're a bear,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1116960","1122080"," you should start getting very bearish. It gets real nasty down here. There are some really severe"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1122080","1130720"," drops below this area. But when we're above here, you kind of have to abide by the rules of the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1130720","1136320"," road, right? The basic rules of where we're trading. And this proves this, showing you guys"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1136320","1147360"," this right now. So I wound up taking longs into this close yesterday here. And my calls, when we"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1147360","1154000"," opened today, they were in the green, even though we closed higher yesterday. And what that means"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1154080","1162240"," is that at the last 15 minutes of yesterday, nobody wanted calls. Too hot to handle, too scary,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1162240","1169120"," and I was scared too. I was pretty scared yesterday. And today they were green, even though we were"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1169120","1178720"," down at some point here. We were down in another 50 points, and my calls were green. They were green"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1178720","1185520"," because interest started to come back into calls, right? And we poked back up later today,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1185520","1191200"," and we sold off into the close. There were some put action for single dates for today's date to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1191200","1197040"," pin the market. The one good thing I can tell you is that there were even though there was a cell"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1197040","1202160"," imbalance today, I wanted to, I need to show you guys some of this stuff live. You can see in the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1202160","1209200"," background, buyers versus sellers, and the buyers outnumbered the sellers into close today,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1210080","1215840"," which means they're being absorbed. There's more interest than going long as of right now into"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1215840","1222880"," close, leading into Monday. One other thing was the last few, if you look over here on the left,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1223120","1232640"," last few calls in the close, people were throwing in, excuse me, spy calls. There are a lot of tech"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1232640","1239360"," calls. The only major hedge, there's some, there's some, the only major hedging I saw, I saw a little"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1239360","1249200"," bit on the spy. I didn't see much on, on Nasdaq. I saw yesterday some hedging on IWM, but you saw"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1249280","1255360"," what the reaction this morning in IWM was. When you start pushing these hedge walls down right"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1255360","1261840"," at bottom, I don't, some people I think are forced to, to buy these things, but even if you are"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1261840","1268480"," active participant in that, the danger, it's so dangerous because once, once liquidity comes up"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1268480","1276000"," into the market, it pushes up, it squeezes, it squeezes people out of the market, squeezes shorts,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1276960","1285280"," it crushes puts, and the price of, or the calls become more valuable, which in turn triggers"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1285280","1292640"," agos to buy calls because they're so cheap, it's this snowball effect. The other thing to consider"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1292640","1301120"," too is we have major puts expiring today. Now there are some market participants that are extending"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1301760","1309200"," the, the put coverage with a daily and one in three day puts, but not at the size that they put on"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1309760","1320000"," that expire this weekend, and then again on the 31st. We do have some tail risk heading into the 31st,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1320000","1327360"," of possibly having a down day on the 31st, and maybe a really high update on the 30th, and then"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1328160","1334720"," on the 1st or the 1st week or so, we should have another relief rally. There is some risk of us"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1334720","1341680"," selling off tomorrow on Monday. There is a large market player out there that has a spread that's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1341680","1347360"," holding the market up. I don't know who this market participant is, but I know that there is some"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1347360","1354080"," serious calls out there that are not allowing us to go deeper right now. Had he closed, well,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1354080","1359680"," people are saying that if he had closed his position at end of day today, it would have been,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1359680","1365760"," we would have, we'd have a big down day on Monday. That's really the biggest risk that I could see"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1365760","1370400"," heading into end of day today for you guys' participants. But the key is this. We've got"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1370400","1375520"," short, couple short weeks coming up. It's the holidays. If you guys are cash getting out there,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1375520","1385520"," yeah, buy hedges on everything. It's easy to buy, it's easy to just buy a spy hedge that's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1385520","1391760"," three months out. Find one at a top, we had a top yesterday, right, or today, two days ago,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1391760","1397520"," we had a top. It's like up here, when we're up here, this was on the 16th, when you're in this"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1397520","1402320"," FOMO bowl phase, or you guys are all stoked or whatever, just go over and buy a really cheap"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1402320","1410560"," hedge. Make it like one to three months out, make it 10 cents. Every time we're at a top up here"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1410560","1415520"," and you're closing out your calls, you want to be also buying yourself a 10 cent hedge,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1416320","1421520"," right? You carry that 10 cent hedge into your next trade, right? So anytime we're at tops,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1422320","1427440"," you're buying hedges. If you do that every time, it'll save you. If we jump over, so let's say"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1427440","1431520"," you buy a hedge up here, we actually broke through volatility to make the move up."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1432080","1437840"," You now know that you can take long and you have some protection behind you, in case we fail."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1440640","1446000"," Yeah, hedging, it might cheap stuff. If you guys, let's say you're spending, we'll use like a hundred"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1446000","1450240"," dollars as an example. If you're, or a thousand, I don't know, if you guys want to spend, let's say"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1450240","1455840"," you're spending a thousand dollars on a trade, and you should be protecting yourself with"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1456720","1462800"," at least 50 bucks, 25 bucks. If you think your move's going the way, let's say you spent a thousand"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1462800","1469760"," dollars on your trade. Are you happy with making a hundred dollars? Because at the least,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1470400","1474960"," you're going to have that hedge start printing if it turns the wrong way and you can cut your"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1475040","1484400"," lawns loose. Does that make sense? Brenda, what are you saying? V-A-S-F-TEC?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1488960","1493920"," For any of you guys that are just joining us, I want you to know that I list stuff, the names I"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1493920","1500160"," had, a toast, Chair said, are you joining us just now? This is the White Claw. In the beginning of"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1500160","1504240"," the video, you can always go back. I mentioned everyone that has helped support the new handle,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1504240","1513520"," the Captain's Alpha handle. So this way, I want you to know how grateful I am. We talked about"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1513520","1518800"," some of the stuff we're going to start adding to the channel. You guys have any questions?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1526240","1527840"," You guys have any questions heading into"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1528720","1533200"," Monday or this upcoming week, these upcoming weeks?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1545440","1552960"," Do you prefer Saturday or Sunday? I was thinking Sunday is probably easier on my end to do a"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1553600","1562080"," charting class or we can do a basic charting class. I can show you how to catch knives and show you"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1562080","1570320"," how to identify stocks that are in a positive uptrend so that you don't have to catch knives."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1571280","1576720"," There are ways, there are a lot of stocks out there that you can play that are just going up"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1576720","1579440"," for long periods of time. They're much easier to trade."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1583600","1587920"," Thank you, Chaz. Good to see you. You're one of the founders, brother."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1590240","1596560"," Yeah, the exact Alex, my IWMFTs were up in value in the close at the bell. They were up."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1597200","1604080"," I've got those same FDs. Mine were green. Okay, so question, right? What is an FD?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1604960","1617680"," It's a misnomer, so people will tell you that it's a financial derivative is what they'll say."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1619440","1627600"," There is a very negative term that's used for it on Wall Street bets. I don't like to say that"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1627600","1632320"," word anymore. I know it does offend people and I don't want to offend anybody, so I'm not going"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1632320","1639520"," to say that word. It didn't start from that word. It started from financial derivative."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1640160","1649760"," It has its background in arbitrage. What Wall Street bets did was a bunch of very smart people"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1650560","1658000"," that trade for a living would spend a lot of time inside of option chains and they figured out that"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1658800","1670480"," while dealers and brokers are trying to hedge the markets, trying to be delta neutral,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1671440","1679200"," that there are moments in an options life where they may be worthless and become very valuable"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1679200","1687280"," over a very short period of time. You may have an option that's worth 10 cents become a dollar"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1688000","1695120"," or $4. There might be an option that is 10 cents that becomes a cycle of an option"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1696560","1703200"," typically towards their end life where there are moments where you can buy these options while"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1703200","1709760"," algorithms and dealers are buying and selling these things and you can make a lot of money."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1712560","1716880"," You hear people say that the market is options driven. There are also algorithms and"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1717440","1724160"," participants that will try to move the market with these same options throughout the course of"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1724160","1731680"," a day. You can see today when we did not rise up that's exactly what took place. Some large market"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1731680","1741120"," participants used the option chain on zero dates to pin the market and to close. Let me go up here"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1741120","1748960"," a little bit. There's a difference too. Oftentimes when I play weeklies I will look for, when we"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1748960","1757040"," start a week, I will look for whichever weeklies are cheapest, puts or calls. If puts are trading"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1757040","1764160"," for pennies, weeklies for pennies, I'll possibly take a short that week or at least that day of"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1764160","1769840"," that week that's five days up and I can typically get those to print at some point during the week."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1770480","1777200"," If we sell off on a Friday into a Monday like today, here's a prime example. We're at the bottom"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1777200","1786960"," of a channel right down here and today 470 calls were 10 cents at the bell. So you know that there"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1786960","1794720"," are smarter people than me looking at a 10 cent call at a bottom of a channel and that everyone is"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1794720","1803120"," short on expensive puts and shorts, dangerous shorts and it wouldn't take a lot of money"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1803680","1810080"," to leverage the market up from there and for people to get very rich off those trades. So that's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1810080","1814640"," what I'm always looking for is when there's fear in the market. I'm always looking for when people"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1814640","1819920"," are panicking. I'm always looking for those moments when everything is out of control. The same goes"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1819920","1828640"," on the upside too. You can do this with puts as well. So F days. Oh, anyways, and there are"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1828640","1834400"," differences in the intrinsic value and options. The more time you put on them, the less damage they"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1834400","1841360"," incur. If the overall trend is up or down, you guys also have to know that puts are inherently"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1842000","1848320"," not meant to be traded that they're one for one most times that your exposure and time exposure"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1848320","1854480"," and puts should be at the move. They tend to lose a lot of value. They tend not to print heavy"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1854480","1859200"," like calls do because there's not as much interest in them, not like calls. There's always more"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1859200","1867360"," interest always seeing in the background real time data what's taking place. So anyway, so not"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1867360","1877600"," just these. Hey Aaron, can you plug me in? Are you guys on the internet maybe? I don't know."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1877680","1883840"," Is there no plug? Do you guys not have a land? Yeah, it's not long enough. You need to sit over"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1883840","1889360"," there. Oh, it is. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm losing. I'm losing this here. This sucks."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1892720","1896000"," I'm losing the connection. Okay, so FD."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1899680","1903600"," Let's see. Probably but not after following you. Good morning cap. You're in your eggs today."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1903680","1908800"," That's on shop cap. Market is so bipolar. Yes. We'll talk about shop."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1911120","1916880"," IWM. Okay, what does split block sweep mean on flow algo? Good questions."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1918320","1926080"," Split block sweep is when a hedge funder bank try to hide their order flow. Even if it's in options,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1926080","1932320"," they try to disperse it so it doesn't affect the market. They'll trade amongst different"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1934080","1939760"," amongst they'll trade from the CME, the New York Stock Exchange. They'll trade from outside of"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1939760","1944560"," the country. There's a bunch of different places that a bank can put orders in and have them filled"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1944560","1949040"," at all at the same time. Sometimes because the orders are so large that they want, they don't"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1949040","1957440"," want the to affect the price. Sometimes they're trying to hide those orders. You said Microsoft"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1957440","1965120"," will be Delta neutral. Okay, so the puts and calls that we're expiring today on Microsoft,"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1966000","1973360"," the dealers and brokers, the market makers, need to at some point in the day become Delta neutral."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1973360","1979760"," So they need to be hedged on both sides and you can do quick math to figure out where that Delta"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1979760","1985920"," neutral is. And at the open this morning, Delta neutral was at that. I think it was 330. That's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1985920","1990080"," what Delta neutral was for misfit. Some of them hit today at some point. Some of them didn't"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1990080","1995120"," quite hit until the bell or possibly after I didn't check misfit the last five minutes or so."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","1996000","2001600"," Need to check that to see because they could have put more more shorts or puts that I didn't see"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2001600","2007760"," today that came into the market on misfit. But you can kind of gauge and get some insight into"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2007760","2013360"," where these tickers need to be heading into close, especially on an OPEX."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2016640","2021920"," When you said Microsoft, okay, yeah, me too. So I said, yeah, so AFD is printed."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2023760","2028640"," Oh, thank you so much. All right, so I'm going to plug in here and get you guys some better"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2030240","2031840"," internet connection or internet."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2036320","2040720"," I've got some better internet now. I'm trying to put a new office together."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2040720","2044480"," I've got two offices and running too much stuff on two different computers. I need to run"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2045120","2052880"," three computers. These computers are banging their core 15s or something. They're pretty good."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2055120","2063120"," Hey, Miro. Hey, Jasmine. Hey, Louie or Lewis. Hey, Steve and AP. Hey, Joe. Hey, T-Chrone. Hey, Alex."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2064560","2070080"," So I'm going to do a class for you guys Sunday. Let's try to make it for 11 a.m. or 10 a.m. Let's do"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2071040","2076800"," let's do 10 a.m. Eastern Center. Is that too early for you guys? 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time?"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2077760","2083600"," Or is 11 better? I know some of you guys are West Coast, but you can always come back."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2085040","2088000"," No more clipping in the feed. Yeah, I had to plug into into the land."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2092320","2098080"," So let's call it 11 a.m. so you guys can sleep in 11 a.m. Sunday Eastern Standard Time."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2098080","2103440"," We're going to start with two basic things. We're going to start with how to catch knives"

"TcHcD_r6hxk","2275280","2279680"," has come into our field of view, we'll add and drop them as we move along. And so maybe for the year"

"TcHcD_r6hxk","2404320","2412400"," do. You're a great indicator to go long or short too. I think I think I sent you a shout out earlier"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2412400","2417600"," Miro. I sold one share and bought another one with that money, but otherwise not extra money in."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2418320","2426320"," Carl, 200 and well, 1222 cheapest call FDS. Yep. The play was probably to buy. The play was probably"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2426320","2432480"," to buy like December 31st. Some kind of call that was like 10 cents."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2435520","2440400"," For 70s. Yeah, Miro. I was just talking to everybody here about this like basics."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2441360","2446080"," If any of you are just joining me, I want you guys to see this chart right here. It's important"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2446160","2452160"," because I was asking earlier, would you have gone short here? No. Would you have gone long"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2452160","2456480"," here? No. Would you have gone short here? No. Gone long here? No. Would you have gone short"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2456480","2460880"," here? No. Long here. Yes. You can get caught in here, right? But when we traded this, we knew"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2460880","2466400"," where the tops were too, because actually back here we knew that the call wall was coming down"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2466400","2472320"," at this time. So we traded this well. But you can see where you know not to go short and today"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2473120","2477920"," we had buyers right here at this resistance. So even above here, you would have cut yourself loose"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2477920","2486400"," above. This gives you some basic idea of knowing when to take or when to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2488240","2493680"," stay in your long, stay in your shorts when you cut them loose. I know Miro knows all about this"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2493680","2502080"," stuff. 480s for 1231. That's a great one right there Adam. 480s for 1231 is a great play. I think"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2502080","2506560"," I've got some of those. I'm not sure. I think I've got a bunch of spy calls. I got a basket."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2506560","2512800"," I got a basket of IBM calls. IBM was printing hard at the open today for me. I didn't sell"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2512800","2524160"," them. I kept them. Yes. So you guys all are long or flat. It's possible we could sell off on Monday"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2524640","2530800"," and there's always that possibility. But the likelihood of it happening is small."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2531920","2535360"," And so I try to trade that the likelihood of what's going to happen."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2539280","2544480"," Miro did you go long? Yeah. You said long yes didn't you Miro? Still holding"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2544960","2549120"," IWM December 31st, 225. Good job William. Right on, right on."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2552000","2557520"," Yeah, yeah. You got the today was the day to collect to take profit on short. If you were short."

"TcHcD_r6hxk","2593840","2599280"," Call wall straw the call wall tomorrow or for Monday right now is 470. So we're playing within"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2599280","2607120"," 4600 and 470. That's the absolute walls on top. Some bottoms. I've got some key numbers for you"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2607120","2615600"," guys. You can play this back later for for spy. I've got key levels for 72 for 70 for 65 for 60."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2615600","2629440"," These are hard hard walls. QQQ's 400 390 385 380 NDX 16 250 16 15 900 15 850. Can always come back"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2630000","2640160"," and get these numbers. If you guys are looking for some combos on the spy 469.72 474.38 479.51"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2640720","2651440"," 470.18 and 472.05. Those are important numbers to know as well. Some combos on NDX are 15 704.0"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2651440","2658880"," 15 9 11.0. Those are important to know as you trade the trade coming in. You guys I'll chart"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2658880","2663520"," the stuff out for you on Sunday but I just want to let you guys know how grateful."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2663840","2671440"," Oh okay great question Steven. You want me to answer the question of how can I clarify my"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2672160","2680160"," my 16 900 NASDAQ prediction. I'll show you that right now. Great question. Trading view."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2685280","2689520"," We'll chart out. I'm not logged in. I don't know if I'm logged in right now."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2690480","2693040"," So we'll look at NQ."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2696640","2702560"," So you guys want to know why I think that you guys want to know why I think that NQ is"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2702560","2709440"," going to tag 16 900. I think it might tag more. I think it might actually tag"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2710320","2721680"," 7 or 1700. I think 16 is the safe bet. You guys want to see why. I'm going to show you guys why okay."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2725680","2729760"," This this line right here is hard resistance. We know this is hard resistance right."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2731600","2733360"," We know this line right here is the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2733920","2742480"," see this big fat yellow line. This is the no go zone. If you're a bull this is like touching an"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2742480","2749760"," electric fence. This yellow line up here right. This yellow line right here and this little white"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2749760","2756160"," line right here. So this this below here is negative gamma okay. I want you to remember"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2756160","2761920"," this these terms. This is negative gamma. This is when we're below this below this area here."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2762720","2768640"," This is really bad for bulls wanting to take longs and if you're a bear this is where you want to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2768640","2775680"," be looking to take short okay. So when we trade down in here if we fail here it's very bad for"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2775680","2783360"," bulls okay. So we had all this negative gamma that was in the market expiring from this trade"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2783360","2790720"," right here back on November 22nd in the queues. All this all these trades all these"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2791520","2798400"," hedging was expiring today and it's going to continue to expire as we move into"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2800240","2805520"," the end of December. We have another big expiry coming up in the end of December but all this"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2805520","2811840"," this is a normal put flow. You have put flow and then you have hedging when a bank is"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2812800","2819600"," the we're in a downturn a bank will buy puts but if they see weakness in the market a liquidation"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2819600","2825920"," event they'll add hedging to their put flow and this hedging is protecting their long investments"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2825920","2831680"," in the market and it is a reaction that takes place when we're in a danger zone and so they did"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2831680","2839040"," that over here and they didn't do it again over here. There was no hedging that took place. There"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2839120","2844560"," was a little bit of hedging but all short dated to the end of the month or with it like the next"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2844560","2850960"," week or two all daily type stuff but nothing that severe like back here. All that stuff is rolling"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2850960","2859760"," off right now. You can see today that we recovered back and we flipped to positive gamma on"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2859760","2867280"," and queue into the close today. So as we're flipping into positive gamma and we've had one in two"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2867280","2874720"," tests it tells you that that that we've looked below twice and we haven't failed and now they're"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2874720","2879600"," going now now the market participants are going to give up chance the market makers everybody's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2879600","2884400"," going to give a chance now they're going to hedge as well to the upside right they're going to"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2884400","2889680"," become delta neutral ahead to the upside and we printed all this stuff down here all these puts"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2889680","2896400"," have printed down here already so now they have to hedge to to ensure that they're covered on the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2896400","2901680"," upside does that make sense if we swing down they hedge on the opposite side so you'll find"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2901680","2908880"," dealers and brokers will buy futures here when we sell down like this for protection on the upside"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2908880","2914400"," so I want to show you why I think 69 and that's because of what pull out here."
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2919120","2924000"," Because we have all of these all of this put flow down here that's coming off the market right"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2924080","2930800"," we have hedging coming off the market we know that as of close on today there was no huge hedging"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2930800","2937040"," to replace it there was expansion and calls on tech today and we have to look above and say"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2937040","2941840"," well how high are we going to go between now and January so let's take a look here"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2943200","2951840"," and you can see this is ndx or nq so we can trade we can trade 150 300 points in a day"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2952560","2959360"," and this is the 31st right here right how does that coincide with how does that coincide with the"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2959360","2967120"," 31st that big yellow line and we know that that big yellow line coincides at 17 0 3 5 so if I say"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2967120","2973440"," what's the potential of us hitting 16 9 with all know with all this known information it's pretty"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2973440","2979360"," high it's not guaranteed stuff could happen between now and then it might happen we might sell down"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2979440","2986160"," into the 31st because of that of the tails and the puts from this hedging that took place"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2986800","2992880"," we could sell down but on the first of January the first week of January we could see all time"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2992880","2999680"," highs once again 17 we could hit 17 000 on the first week of January second week of January so"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","2999680","3004480"," my question in that in twitter the other night was what do you think the chances are of us hitting"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3004800","3011120"," 16 9 in the next three weeks and the chances are high as of right now 100 percent take that"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3011120","3018960"," bet any day of the week can we really allow i'd having to need a lower that's a tough one"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3020080","3024800"," it's a tough one too they should have bought the hell out of 393 that if i was a book bear that's"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3024800","3033120"," what i would do and they they it's hard to say so we have a lot of money in these bottoms there"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3033120","3040480"," are major banks holding major long positions and we're coming into an opex we didn't see that"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3040480","3046560"," selling in this opex do i think though that we'll see some selling into the 31st yes i know you guys"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3046560","3051360"," hear that the furrows out there they're always saying what do they call it tax loss harvesting"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3051360","3058640"," every year you will see can some continued tax loss harvesting in a lot of speculative growth"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3058640","3065920"," trades and a lot of covid trades from 2020 that will wrap up on the 31st there is still some"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3065920","3071040"," volatility and that is the one last thing is for us to have a real rocket field rally"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3072400","3077440"," i don't like the vix at 22 or whenever we closed that today i really wanted to see vix today up"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3077440","3084880"," around like 25 30 we didn't get that so maybe we see that 30 vix on the tail end on the 31st"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3085600","3091360"," we sell down from now we do a nice slow sell down from now into the next week or so week and a half"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3091360","3095120"," right we only have so many trade and training days and then we come into some heavy volatility"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3095120","3100720"," heading into the end of the year we hit 30 and then we have a ripper into the new year"
"TcHcD_r6hxk","3103280","3106880"," you guys you guys following along with all this stuff why i see 16.9 now"
