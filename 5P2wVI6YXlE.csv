"3480","8900"," Okay, let's see if we've been on a little bit late."
"22820","27320"," I didn't know that you could hear that echo to get out."
"27980","33740"," Good morning. "
"34340","35120"," Good morning, Jacob."
"35120","36160"," Good morning, Jacob."
"36620","37340"," Good morning, Jacob. "
"38360","39460"," Nick, Pinky, Joshua."
"40940","42120"," Good morning, Dougie."
"42720","44580"," Good morning, Mikey, the Fish. "
"46220","47640"," Hell's yay, boy, boy, friend."
"47860","48380"," Hit Mikey."
"49080","49780"," Sue, good morning. "
"50380","51080"," Jeremy, Patrick."
"52820","54280"," Sorry for the beeping in the background."
"54540","56000"," I've got a surprise for you all this morning. "
"57300","58820"," You should like this surprise."
"60880","63980"," I don't know if you like it or not, but good morning, Dylan."
"78560","82100"," I don't know about you all last night, but I didn't get any sleep. "
"82980","84600"," Good morning, Euro Boomer."
"85280","86660"," I got no sleep last night."
"86820","87360"," Good morning, Lucy. "
"88660","91600"," All I thought of was the market all day long."
"92860","93960"," Uh, we got a lot of money."
"93960","94780"," I'm not going to talk about this morning. "
"96200","98240"," So we're going to get started whether people are here or not."
"98360","98980"," Good morning, Frederick."
"99840","101240"," We have a lot to talk about. "
"103200","105000"," Yesterday, I was asked a question."
"105660","107160"," We'll get into the markets here real quick."
"107260","108200"," I'm going to make this real quick though. "
"108480","109560"," There's a need to get this out there."
"109820","111720"," Good morning, Mohan."
"111900","112600"," Good morning, Phaison. "
"112820","113460"," Good morning, Frederick."
"115100","116440"," Good morning, everybody out there."
"116560","119920"," If you're watching or listening right now, I hope you're having a wonderful morning. "
"120080","121380"," I hope that you got some sleep last night."
"121380","122360"," I didn't."
"122440","123540"," I was in panic all night long. "
"123960","124840"," Of course, right?"
"125320","126060"," Yeah, no sleep fluid."
"126180","128199"," All I do is stay on market all night long last night."
"128320","130180"," And then I had to play Captain Mom this morning. "
"130640","131220"," It was wild."
"131520","132480"," Good morning, goog."
"133080","135080"," Hell, hell yes, Adam. "
"135220","135560"," Good morning."
"135840","136000"," Okay."
"136380","137680"," So I'm going to get this out real quick, okay?"
"138620","139340"," LFGA, agree. "
"141480","142980"," We are in Euro Boomer."
"143180","144580"," That's our conversation this morning."
"145460","146560"," That is our conversation. "
"146880","148220"," We're going to make this really fast this morning, okay?"
"148600","149740"," One talk to you guys about some stuff."
"149740","150560"," Yes, there's that question."
"151100","152440"," Are you still bearish?"
"152760","154040"," And my response was yes. "
"154400","159880"," And I've seen a lot of mocking on social media on people with that response, which gives me some"
"159880","160980"," pause for concern."
"162340","171080"," If you follow me on Twitter, if you follow me on YouTube, there is some basic trading concepts that"
"171080","177980"," I need you to take on as a trader or as an investor that you should always be aware of"
"177980","180420"," in conscience of when you're investing in trading."
"181140","184560"," Euro Boomer brought up a really good point and it was actually the topic of our conversation this"
"184560","184720"," morning. "
"185000","186080"," It's important to talk about this."
"186480","187500"," We're going to make this really quick."
"187660","188160"," This is a lot. "
"188300","191800"," For a lot of you guys all understand this, but for some of you, whether forget it or you need"
"191800","196700"," a refresher or, you know, you get into that mode, whether you're bullish or bearish and you forget"
"196700","197340"," certain things."
"197700","200420"," So we're going to refresh it today and just to be clear, okay?"
"201160","203920"," As to why I said yesterday, I'm still bearish."
"204320","205960"," So we're going to make this a really quick, okay?"
"205960","208540"," And most of you know this, some of you don't, some of you forget, okay?"
"208880","214520"," So if we are in a accumulation phase on stock A, let's say, okay, we go up and then we"
"214520","216180"," move into a distribution phase, right?"
"217760","219040"," And eventually, there's no more buyers. "
"219320","223040"," We end up selling down, but then we find buyers at a lower level, right?"
"223200","224700"," We trade up again, right?"
"224860","226060"," We trade sideways like so."
"226340","229200"," Maybe we trade down and then we trade up like this, right?"
"229680","231020"," And we do this kind of a thing right here, right?"
"231020","234060"," And over time, we are forming a channel, right?"
"234840","236240"," And that channel is up."
"236920","242800"," So no matter where we are in this channel, if you were to ask me, hey, Captain Jim, are you"
"242800","244620"," a bullish or bearish here?"
"244840","247200"," My response would always be bullish. "
"247940","251220"," Bullish here, bullish below, bullish down here."
"251580","255760"," But when we trade down from here, as long as we're staying in that, in that acute, that larger"
"255760","259480"," channel that we're trading in, I'm bullish, okay?"
"259480","262040"," I had no time in here, am I bearish?"
"262640","263900"," And we have to remember that, okay?"
"264340","267000"," Now, we have larger timeframes that we trade on."
"267620","269500"," And sometimes we do this thing right here, right?"
"269780","275420"," But we break through at some point this established trend line, right?"
"276920","279520"," And this is when you have a major break. "
"279900","284340"," This is when people ask you to add, when people say to you, hey, you know, was there something that"
"284340","287560"," took place in the market while you're not bullish anymore?"
"287560","291680"," And it's because we broke something that's worked until it didn't, right?"
"291820","295860"," And the moment that that didn't work anymore, I become bearish, right?"
"296000","298260"," Until we reclaim this zone up here or this channel."
"298520","302300"," If we don't reclaim this channel, though, we start to trend down, right?"
"302980","304660"," We break below, right?"
"304840","306440"," We start to trade sideways again."
"306940","308480"," We end up breaking below, right?"
"308840","311020"," We start to trade sideways again, right?"
"311160","312220"," We break below here. "
"312820","315040"," And let's say we hammer out a bottom here, okay?"
"315680","321720"," Now, this is where this is oftentimes where traders and investors lose money in the market."
"321960","327520"," They lose money on tickers because there is a new channel that we're in down below here, right?"
"328300","329980"," We're actually should put it right here, I guess."
"330260","331160"," But we can get that channel even. "
"331500","332600"," It's right here, right?"
"333040","334400"," That's what that channel actually is."
"335040","343100"," So my point is that until you reclaim, let me get rid of this real quick, right?"
"343100","344420"," Let me get rid of this real quick, right?"
"345400","350040"," So even if we quote unquote put a bottom in down here, there's a couple of things you always have"
"350040","350380"," to remember."
"350840","354060"," One, we sometimes will get a V-shaped recovery. "
"354820","360200"," We will usually still come back to retest, depending upon how big the break is, even if it's months"
"360200","362920"," down the road, we'll eventually come back to retest."
"363460","369080"," And oftentimes that retest is sooner than later, within the first month, if not at the three month"
"369080","369280"," mark."
"369440","371600"," It might be slightly higher, but eventually we'll come back and retest. "
"371600","375860"," Not always, but we have a major trend break that typically happens."
"376240","381340"," The second portion of this is even though we're recovering off a bottom here, right?"
"381620","382200"," Sorry, hold on."
"382720","383580"," I don't know what I'm doing here. "
"384660","389500"," Even though we're recovering off a bottom here, this is the bullish context here."
"389560","390360"," I want you to remember that, okay?"
"390740","393400"," But this here, this is the bullish context."
"394000","395440"," This is the bearish context. "
"396340","398940"," And this specifically applies to a lot of stocks."
"398940","402940"," If you see people get stuck in stocks, it will start to recover here."
"403760","405480"," And they get uber-duper bullish. "
"406140","410020"," And then we get to this major resistance point, and we start to sell down again."
"410540","415600"," Okay, so if you're to ask me anywhere in this descending channel, am I bullish?"
"415820","417500"," My answer is no, I am bearish."
"417880","420760"," I'm going to put extra protection on if I buy this bottom down here. "
"421420","426600"," Especially as I get higher here, I'm going to put even more protection on for retest down below or"
"426600","427700"," a failure at some point."
"428960","434280"," Now, let's say we get up to this resistance point, okay, in this downward channel, right?"
"434560","435980"," I'm not bearish anymore."
"436640","437600"," I'm now neutral. "
"438140","442580"," I'm now looking for a breakup above a trade sideways to consolidate at the least."
"443260","444540"," And then I move higher, right?"
"445000","448800"," So that I can take on a new found bullishness inside of this market, right?"
"450140","455940"," And I'm still going to put some protection on, but not like I would normally, until I get to where"
"455940","457580"," we left off up here, okay?"
"458400","460400"," And so this is like super bearish down here."
"460520","461920"," This is bearish bearish. "
"462280","464580"," This right here is not bullish, not bearish."
"464720","467520"," So it's almost kind of neutral with a bullish outlook, right?"
"467860","474180"," And then I'm not going to get bullish again until we're back in that old trading, that trend line,"
"474460","479420"," or we create a new trend line and break all time highs, then I'm completely bullish up here."
"479840","485580"," And we always pay attention to that, because what happens is you end up making a mistake where"
"485580","487380"," you're uber bullish, right?"
"487840","489500"," And it fails, right?"
"489660","490380"," It ends up failing. "
"490560","495560"," You still haven't broken out of this, this break, this major failure that we had."
"495980","499520"," And, you know, a prime example of this is SQ, okay?"
"500220","501240"," This is SQ here."
"501600","507320"," And this is a perfect example of a distribution pattern, an accumulation phase, distribution"
"507320","510820"," sideways, a couple breaks that eventually end up selling off deeply. "
"510820","516960"," And you can see that you catch bulls in this problem, and they keep buying and buying the dip and"
"516960","520179"," buying the dip in reality what you're looking for, especially here, right?"
"520500","526620"," Right here you're looking for some kind of a confirmation here that you are breaking past, right?"
"527200","533060"," You see the hammered out bottom here, but even now you want to see some form of consolidation, and"
"533060","534040"," then a move higher, right?"
"534960","536720"," I hope that makes sense to all of you out there."
"537580","541180"," I want you to be clear in that so that when you were asking me yesterday, are we bullish?"
"541280","541780"," Are we bearish?"
"541840","544520"," Because this morning, we were at a critical point within the market."
"545380","551300"," And that's the key behind this talk that we're having right now, is because right now inside this"
"551300","553320"," market, I want to show you guys some real quick here. "
"554600","557480"," Is this the, yeah, do a Fib retracement here?"
"558180","565600"," I want to show you guys some here on this Fib retracement, okay?"
"566380","568440"," And Shocker, look where we are right now."
"569080","571680"," We're coming up here on the 0.618, right?"
"571680","575340"," This is an important place for us to be trading above here, right?"
"575640","579640"," And we're also on this major downtrend line right here, right?"
"579960","580840"," We talked about this."
"580960","585140"," You see this often in stocks that are on a decline, right?"
"585260","586700"," And we can still trade above here. "
"586960","590500"," But the key this morning is that we're looking for a break above."
"590680","593960"," We always talk about let the banks do that work for you at this point, right?"
"594080","596060"," You let the banks work for you above here."
"596340","598700"," If we end up breaking above, right?"
"598700","604520"," And let's say we get a rejection of 4600, we start to have to consolidate sideways before the next"
"604520","605260"," leg up, right?"
"606300","610000"," Or if we wind up rejecting here outright, right?"
"610140","611940"," This can become very dangerous in here. "
"612260","616120"," Spock, Emma, this morning saying that they expect low volatility in the market."
"616120","622300"," They expect us to maybe reject 4600 and then trade sideways, let's say, right?"
"622480","625680"," Until we find more support to move up on the bell this morning."
"625680","628180"," But I want you to realize that right where we are right now, right?"
"628300","631800"," This is the last point of being uber bullet bearish. "
"632120","634220"," So if you were asking me yesterday, my uber bearish, yes."
"634480","637540"," This morning, as we opened this morning, this is the riskiest part."
"638020","642420"," Being a bull right now is going long on the bell this morning. "
"642980","644900"," Because there can be firm rejection here."
"645160","648780"," This is the last chance for the bears to say, hey, we're bearish."
"649160","651640"," And we're going to keep this bearish of momentum going. "
"651980","654980"," Even after all this recovery, this is the danger zone."
"654980","657960"," This is like the end all sale for the bears out there."
"658400","661800"," So bears are probably pissing their pants, scared chilis. "
"661920","663720"," I'm adding on more puts as we head up here."
"664040","669160"," So I just want you to realize that for where we actually are in the market, the danger that we're"
"669160","669380"," in."
"669640","672180"," And even if we were to break above today as a bull, right?"
"672540","674460"," Question becomes do we hit 4680?"
"674680","675460"," I don't know that it's today. "
"675900","677880"," I think we could, you know, do this quick shot up."
"678180","683400"," And then we come back down, bounce around and start to wait into Friday to see what Amazon does"
"683400","685580"," before making a shot higher here."
"685880","689380"," Now from here, right, in this zone, this is when you become more neutral. "
"689960","695520"," Now once if you find support here and we start to trade higher at any point, then I'll start"
"695520","696640"," getting a bullish outlook."
"697180","699440"," I'll start saying to know you buy the dip here."
"699840","703540"," No, you don't worry about us trading down here because we are looking up at this point. "
"703920","706600"," There's way to be clear of this as we move into this morning."
"706600","706960"," Okay."
"707600","711780"," Now on the economic calendar this morning, it doesn't show too much. "
"711940","712440"," It does show."
"712860","717640"," So today we've got 80p of the, excuse me, let me see if I can get this to reload."
"718320","719460"," I had a problem with it reloading. "
"719680","723140"," We have an 80p on employment report and that really does tie into this whole entire week."
"723140","727500"," I put a post on Twitter saying we have to talk about, or this week is going to be all"
"727500","728320"," about jobs, right?"
"728420","730020"," It's going to be all the people are spending money on."
"730100","731460"," It's going to be their personal spending habits. "
"732180","736040"," And this is going to really be most important for Friday."
"736420","739940"," Now what's not on this economic calendar is OPEC."
"739940","743320"," OPEC is today around the 10 to 10 30 hour. "
"743420","744480"," I think it's at 10 30."
"744800","749220"," Not quite sure what time that's at, but I know that it's around there like 10, 10 30."
"749360","750320"," That is going to be important. "
"750940","753040"," Now that doesn't normally matter."
"753320","756200"," There's actually, it's more important tomorrow than it is today."
"756380","759660"," But you never know if they're going to pull a fast one, right?"
"760000","766120"," We've had some great, great gains on oil, but this is a prime time, right?"
"766560","769500"," Everyone's going to be expecting a good short on oil. "
"769500","774760"," We've got energy companies reporting all week, and we've got OPEC going on today and tomorrow, but"
"774760","777400"," tomorrow actually is a more dangerous day."
"777820","784040"," But we want to start looking at shorting oil and energy companies coming into, at maybe end of day"
"784040","784780"," today and tomorrow."
"785320","787360"," And that leads me to the next thing I want to talk about. "
"787580","791060"," You guys have been with me for so long now that I'm still stoked, right?"
"791360","795660"," There's something I haven't introduced to you that I'm going to introduce you to you this morning,"
"795660","797140"," and especially when I'm not talking."
"797140","799760"," If I'm, I've been spending, you guys have done it."
"800360","801860"," I love all of you guys out there. "
"802100","805620"," But you have to understand that what I'm on with you guys, like eight hours a day, right?"
"806120","810000"," It's a long day, like the eight, nine, 30 in the morning until four, 30 in the afternoon is a"
"810000","810400"," long day."
"810900","813760"," Then I have to do my own research, I have to do my own trading, and then, you know, I've"
"813760","818960"," got two daughters and I've got a home and all this other stuff right that I have going on my"
"818960","819300"," life too."
"819400","822560"," So where it really does take a lot out of me. "
"822660","825480"," So I have to have, if I'm, let's say I'm here a key pivot."
"825480","829920"," I leave the, if I leave the stream on, right?"
"830280","833320"," I'm able to spend some time on Twitter, some time on the Discord."
"833760","837640"," Or currently right now where I'm live streaming straight eight hours a day, I don't think that I"
"837640","838140"," can do that. "
"838240","845240"," So what I'm trying to do is just do the openings and closes, some key pivots, and then try to"
"845240","849160"," spend some more time in Discord or Twitter trading for myself."
"849760","857380"," But in that time when it's, when we just have the, uh, the chat going in, in the, um, the"
"857380","864200"," book map going, I wanted to introduce one more, uh, thing to this feed that we haven't introduced"
"864200","865380"," to you in the past yet."
"865740","870000"," And I know some of you guys know about like Ben Zinga's got Ben Zinga, Charlie or something his"
"870000","870400"," name is. "
"870700","873960"," Uh, I use the trade, I use a new squawk service."
"874780","875480"," It's, it's expensive."
"875480","879840"," Um, but it's the news, it's the news squawk. "
"879940","882240"," Believe it or not that like Walter Bloomberg uses."
"882920","886860"," So I get this new squawk before when you see news on Twitter."
"887620","892200"," Uh, when you see like Walter Bloomberg post something on Twitter, I typically get it anywhere from"
"892200","894380"," one to five minutes before he does. "
"894620","897860"," I don't know how that translates in our live streams."
"897860","903080"," If, if you'll get it before Walter Bloomberg tweets something, but it doesn't always work."
"903520","908920"," But I want to tell you that, uh, when this guy talks about the news, it's typically before a move"
"908920","914080"," or not totally, but enough that it's before a moment in the market that moves up or down. "
"914580","919540"," Uh, so whenever I'm not on here, blabbing my face off and blasting away all day long, or if I'm"
"919540","923140"," like, hey, I'm going to step away for half an hour or until lunchtime or whatever until pivot."
"923580","926580"," Uh, what I'll do is I'll turn this new service on for you."
"926900","931380"," So you have something to trade against with book map and while, and while talking in the chat. "
"931700","934460"," So I'm going to bring that up this morning and turn it on for you."
"934780","937620"," And we can talk over it and stuff as it, as it does its thing."
"938540","942380"," Uh, but typically it's faster than any other, it's faster than Zinga. "
"942480","944520"," It's faster than anything out there you guys are ever going to find."
"945480","949840"," Uh, it's, it's probably the fastest news squawk I've ever subscribed to."
"950180","953260"," Uh, so we'll play that and see if it fits in well with the broadcast. "
"953840","957140"," So let's say I'm like, hey, I'm going to stick around with you until nine, 30, 10, 30 every"
"957140","957640"," morning, whatever."
"960060","965300"," Um, and I'm going to step away from it and I'll turn this, this, uh, trade the new stuff up"
"965300","967100"," so that this new squawk up for you guys."
"967560","972620"," And I'm going to try to buy another computer and see if I can stream the audio to you guys"
"972620","974980"," inside the discord at some point. "
"975120","978540"," So it's just always on the discord if you just want to, if you want to tune into it there"
"978540","982040"," and then we'll just, you know, don't, you know, don't go telling everybody about it."
"982040","986200"," But, um, oh, wait a minute."
"986280","987060"," Fuck something up. "
"987820","988180"," Yeah."
"988260","989040"," Can you guys hear me out there?"
"989720","990060"," Okay."
"993770","994130"," Yeah. "
"995350","996830"," No, no, this isn't your fault out there."
"996870","1000650"," I don't want you guys to think for a moment that you guys are involved in this."
"1000690","1005330"," I'm, I'm the one that's putting too much time into this and it started into effect up my, uh, my"
"1005330","1005830"," personal life. "
"1005910","1010290"," It's just, it's becoming all consuming and I'm not taking care of of some of the stuff that I have"
"1010290","1010950"," to take care of."
"1011270","1015570"," I got some, yeah, I got to take care of my kids and, um, you know, whatever."
"1015910","1018450"," Anyways, I want to talk to you guys about the rest of us now this morning. "
"1018490","1018850"," Okay."
"1018970","1020150"," On the opening bell this morning."
"1020510","1021390"," I'm going to pop up. "
"1021870","1023170"," Uh, I want to pop up."
"1026869","1027230"," Ooh."
"1027609","1027970"," Winky. "
"1028109","1028930"," I'll buy one from your brother."
"1029050","1034349"," I want to, I want to stream this, uh, this news, uh, winky so that everybody can get it inside"
"1034349","1034910"," the discord."
"1035170","1036030"," So you guys don't pay for it. "
"1036030","1038589"," It's like, uh, it's like 250 bucks a month."
"1039450","1040930"," So it'll be free for all you guys."
"1041349","1042349"," All you weirdos out there. "
"1046710","1047550"," Awesome sauce."
"1048030","1048670"," Hell yeah."
"1048890","1049970"," You run the hell. "
"1049970","1050290"," Yeah."
"1051290","1051810"," Okay."
"1051810","1053830"," So I want to talk to you guys about some real quick here. "
"1054270","1056070"," So what's my take on this morning?"
"1056070","1056430"," Okay."
"1056990","1057590"," It's a few things."
"1058510","1059910"," 460 is the target. "
"1059910","1060330"," Okay."
"1061390","1066110"," Look for a four 52, possibly four 50 as a bounce point."
"1066810","1069050"," Uh, heading into the open this morning. "
"1069910","1072790"," You're going to be looking really, really looking for like four 50."
"1073370","1079050"," Call it like four 53.54 for 50 to four 51 81."
"1079430","1079670"," There's another. "
"1079850","1080870"," This is why I'll give you a bunch of numbers."
"1081250","1084470"," And by the way, my intern is going to start helping me as well."
"1084890","1086990"," She's going to post the support resistance levels. "
"1087450","1091330"," So I can get back on track here and try to get some help to put information out every day."
"1091890","1097610"," Uh, so you're looking for a tag or for support of four 53.54 for 52."
"1097610","1100170"," 42.43 for 51 81. "
"1100630","1101910"," Then ultimately for 50."
"1102170","1105170"," If you see a break of 450, that is no bueno."
"1105630","1107190"," That means the bears are stepping in. "
"1107290","1108610"," We're going to watch flow algo."
"1109130","1110130"," Uh, and that's the other thing."
"1110150","1116270"," If I can get that computer winky, I can put like a flow algo stream and the new squawk and"
"1116270","1118110"," pipe it direct into the discord every day. "
"1118530","1123450"," So if you get like a new trader that wants to just watch, let's say flow algo with the new"
"1123450","1129730"," squawk, that'd be badass, especially if somebody else is piping in the book map in there."
"1129830","1131070"," That'd be totally badass dude."
"1131730","1132410"," Totally badass. "
"1133990","1134470"," Okay."
"1134830","1137710"," So I want to get the fix to all of you guys out there."
"1137970","1145190"," So yeah, I got to build that a captain about a screen schedule out to make it not as intensive. "
"1145910","1148750"," But so just coming off into the open here, right?"
"1149110","1153050"," You've got bulls without a doubt that missed the trade yesterday."
"1153050","1155970"," Do not believe that anybody caught that trade yesterday."
"1156690","1157850"," We caught that trade yesterday. "
"1158590","1160610"," And then we caught it again after the bell."
"1160830","1161210"," We bought it."
"1161290","1164710"," We picked it back up at 402 or 405, right?"
"1164830","1165710"," We grabbed more calls. "
"1166210","1167310"," We made some more money."
"1167810","1172410"," And then we bought more calls at 415 or 414 for today at the open, right?"
"1173010","1174090"," So that's not everybody."
"1174510","1176310"," Traders, investors weren't doing that yesterday. "
"1176930","1179050"," They weren't holding calls into the bell yesterday."
"1179370","1182810"," They weren't buying and selling them multiple times three, four times."
"1182810","1185250"," So they want this this morning. "
"1185530","1187670"," You're going to hear all kinds of shit from people out there."
"1187730","1190650"," They want this to trade down on the open this morning."
"1191130","1195870"," So they can catch a grab down below it, 450, 451, 453. "
"1196070","1200090"," And then you've got bulls that have been in since down below it 420."
"1200530","1201230"," They're adding protection."
"1201790","1207390"," And then this is the last chance for the bears to make a stand, right?"
"1207610","1208870"," This is their last chance right here. "
"1209230","1211350"," So you might find some weakness into the bell opening bell."
"1211350","1213330"," You can do two things."
"1213510","1215930"," You can sell right off the bell, take your profit, your money and run. "
"1216610","1219850"," You can hope for one or two or three taps."
"1220730","1221950"," Run some support from yesterday."
"1222810","1224190"," And then a run quickly up, right?"
"1224690","1227490"," You'll see like that first bounce down or you'll see a fake excuse me. "
"1227550","1228370"," You'll see a fake out up."
"1228690","1230750"," The quick bounce down, you'll panic sell your calls."
"1231450","1235350"," And then 20 minutes later, it's right back to where we opened today. "
"1236050","1237430"," Or even higher it for 60."
"1238290","1240150"," I can't tell you how to take your money."
"1241650","1243570"," I tend to take my money off the bell. "
"1244530","1246010"," That's all I'll leave you with on that."
"1247370","1248810"," I like to take my profits."
"1249770","1252390"," If it trades back down and I can grab another rip higher, I will. "
"1253070","1255130"," We'll look for two bounces and then a rip higher."
"1255810","1259070"," We'll look for all kinds of setups we can look for if we're selling this market."
"1259670","1265650"," While we also are today, it's important that you pay attention to the news because the news will"
"1265650","1267790"," either be focused on..."
"1267790","1268890"," We have no news today, right?"
"1269070","1270210"," There's no news in the market today. "
"1270690","1276270"," No economic calendar at all today, except for OPEC at 10.30. So you're going to be looking for the"
"1276270","1279190"," news to be manufactured for positive or negative."
"1280030","1284450"," Be hyper aware of that as we trade from now into the 10.30 hour."
"1284890","1286730"," Because we could trade higher on just great news. "
"1287370","1290130"," They're going to pump some fluff bullshit out there for you and they're going to rip higher."
"1290590","1294690"," If they start to get negative Nancy on you, you know they're telling you they're trying to sell"
"1294690","1295010"," lower."
"1295150","1297430"," We're going to listen at once the bell hits. "
"1297430","1302410"," We're going to listen to this trade, the news, so you guys can get a feel for what I'm talking"
"1302410","1302670"," about."
"1302710","1308910"," You'll see the market react to this news as it's a live squat because this guy's going to talk and"
"1308910","1313550"," you'll actually see the market move at key points today, right?"
"1313690","1314930"," This will be important for us today."
"1315550","1317070"," Okay, so we're going to check all that out. "
"1318900","1320280"," Yeah, this is the bear alamo."
"1320920","1321320"," 100%."
"1321320","1323220"," This is the bear alamo. "
"1323220","1326300"," This is it because after today, right?"
"1326480","1328320"," I can't say I'm bearish anymore today."
"1328440","1331280"," I may have to tell you I'm neutral if we continue to trade up."
"1331360","1337060"," We trade for 60 if we bounce around at 450 and start working towards 460 over the rest of this"
"1337060","1337280"," week. "
"1337880","1340400"," I can't claim that I'm bearish at that point."
"1341120","1343320"," I do think we start to calm down trade sideways."
"1343720","1346740"," Spock Emma's general viewpoint today is that we're going to calm down today. "
"1347080","1352060"," You should see I'm going to probably take profit right off the bell on my putstail or my recalls"
"1352060","1352580"," today."
"1352580","1357040"," And I'm going to look for us to trade back at some point to take some profit on my puts."
"1357420","1358940"," I think we do trade back a little bit. "
"1359100","1362820"," I don't think I'm super uber bearish unless we see crazy puts coming in."
"1363160","1363540"," We'll know."
"1363740","1365600"," We'll know right off the bell under the 1030 hour. "
"1365960","1369420"," I think when the first two, three hours of open this morning, what's going to take place?"
"1372520","1373700"," You guys got there?"
"1374600","1376960"," New ADP jobs numbers were negative."
"1376960","1381080"," It was 300,000 minus 300,000 new opics says going to maintain."
"1381520","1383880"," Yeah, they do say that, right?"
"1384040","1385740"," They do say they're going to maintain current levels. "
"1385740","1387860"," And then some you guys know it's a cartel, right?"
"1388140","1389240"," You guys know it's all a cartel."
"1389820","1395540"," If you think gold and silver is a grift by the United States government, there ain't nothing like"
"1395540","1395740"," OPEC."
"1396080","1396940"," That's the straight mafia. "
"1399040","1400440"," Yeah, bad news, good news."
"1401080","1405560"," Yeah, I should have a discord."
"1405560","1409660"," I should have a discord link inside the description on how to get into the discord. "
"1409920","1411860"," I did post it on my regular Twitter handle."
"1412240","1413700"," I don't know if that worked or not."
"1414200","1417660"," I think I did that on the over the weekend, but I'll get another linked post. "
"1418140","1420660"," Or if one of you guys can get an invite."
"1421160","1422400"," Can you guys not invite people?"
"1422580","1423640"," Is it a private discord or something?"
"1424280","1425300"," I'll do that this morning."
"1425400","1427100"," I'll post something in the chat. "
"1428280","1429720"," So I'm going to be looking to take some profit."
"1430160","1431240"," I like to count my dollars."
"1431580","1432460"," I like to put them in my pocket. "
"1433020","1436140"," And if we if we do get a bounce at some point, let's say we rip."
"1436280","1440500"," Even if we rip in a green bar off the bell here, we rip higher and then we trade lower."
"1440920","1445260"," I will buy another dip if there's another dip down to 450 or 453 somewhere in there. "
"1445460","1447240"," We'll turn on book about here in just a second."
"1447660","1453620"," And we'll get it all spun up so that we have a better insight than Joe trader out there, right?"
"1458420","1459700"," So what's the next question here?"
"1459820","1463280"," If we go bull, isn't the de-hedging going to just cause another strong rally?"
"1463280","1466820"," I don't think we get the strong rally right now."
"1466840","1471040"," There's some de-hedging and there's some still on. "
"1471540","1473600"," There's still some on right now."
"1474100","1475440"," What we really need to do, right?"
"1475800","1480680"," If you're a bull, what you really need to do is you need to see expansion in calls."
"1481000","1483140"," Like you need to see it. "
"1483320","1487240"," And we're still not quite seeing that expansion in calls."
"1487960","1492320"," This is going to be a point probably in the next, I would say next one to three days."
"1493040","1495340"," You're going to be waiting on your same old shit, right?"
"1495420","1496740"," You're going to be waiting on the rest of earnings. "
"1497840","1501220"," You're hopefully going to get an Amazon trade because of the Google split."
"1503380","1506580"," Or maybe Amazon will raise rates or something, right?"
"1507400","1510040"," They have a bad ER, but they say screw it."
"1510080","1513300"," We're going to charge everybody double for their Amazon prime. "
"1513600","1515380"," And oh, by the way, we're also going to split the stock."
"1517200","1521940"," Now, there's some stock that the Google split has more to do with their entry into the Dow."
"1522500","1523880"," That's probably probable. "
"1524260","1528300"," But just like the Apple split, all of a sudden you get Tesla split and right what?"
"1528660","1530160"," Just the next cycle."
"1530460","1532380"," So nothing would surprise me in this market."
"1533460","1535340"," And you're just going to be looking for it today. "
"1535440","1537040"," You want to see what unfolds today."
"1537440","1538940"," Let the market breathe a little bit."
"1539340","1544480"," Even if we're going to trade higher from here, just remember, okay, we're at a point in the market"
"1544480","1546840"," where you let the banks do the work for you. "
"1547020","1549200"," You let hedge funds do the work for you."
"1549200","1550320"," They do the heavy lifting over."
"1550780","1552460"," And then we look for a move higher. "
"1552680","1553640"," We jump on that move higher."
"1554140","1556300"," If we reject here, you're going to know it, right?"
"1556480","1559260"," It'll be like a slap in the face if we reject at this point."
"1561360","1563340"," Right now outside, we're getting rain and free. "
"1563500","1564760"," It's all the rain starting to freeze."
"1565340","1566980"," I'm probably going to lose power here at some point soon."
"1567420","1568820"," It's not quite snowing yet. "
"1569280","1569740"," Is that what you mean?"
"1574340","1574960"," Hold on here."
"1585460","1586220"," You guys hear me?"
"1586460","1587820"," Look, let me turn this up real quick for you."
"1589040","1590700"," I'm going to turn this one off here. "
"1591100","1592700"," You guys all saw this or caught this."
"1592860","1597460"," If you missed any part of the broadcast, I would ask you to go back and watch it from whenever"
"1597460","1603820"," we started charting out at least the S&P so that you could have a context for where we are"
"1603820","1608720"," currently in the S&P, the whatever spot, whatever you're trading out there."
"1609140","1610560"," You go back, watch this video. "
"1610720","1615460"," They come back to us before the opening bell this morning because it is critical where we are in"
"1615460","1616160"," the market right now."
"1616160","1622640"," It's critical for you to have the concept of bearish, neutral, bullish and how we take this north"
"1622640","1622840"," here."
"1623160","1624300"," There's so much room here. "
"1624360","1625400"," Why do you guys have to see that too?"
"1625520","1627040"," That there's so much room here, right?"
"1629520","1632080"," You guys want to be like super duper bull, right?"
"1632200","1632660"," I get it."
"1633020","1634160"," Get it all day long."
"1634440","1640500"," The one thing you need to do is you need to allow the banks to do the hard work for"
"1640500","1640680"," you. "
"1640700","1643560"," You're not the guy and I'm not the guy that's pushing it up and over."
"1643560","1646660"," There's nothing that we're doing here that's going to break this here."
"1647000","1649000"," You're going to wait for us to get above this. "
"1649260","1651300"," This is a huge resistance here."
"1651720","1652140"," Huge."
"1653080","1656180"," It's been respected once, twice, and this would be the third time. "
"1656540","1659920"," If it rejects here, right, you will likely see some."
"1661360","1662460"," I don't think we reject."
"1662680","1664760"," I think we trade higher and then bounce around in here. "
"1665480","1669740"," If there is a huge rejection though, right off the bell, if we start trading down and start"
"1669740","1675320"," breaking through here, it's nothing for us to retest for 30s."
"1675900","1682800"," It's even the impact of being rejected here means that we're not ready to trade higher, right?"
"1682960","1684400"," We look above, right?"
"1684540","1685160"," We're already here."
"1685260","1686720"," We made this far right here. "
"1687000","1688620"," We should have a look above today."
"1689120","1691380"," Take a look above and be like, hey, is this is where we want to be?"
"1691860","1693800"," And we're going to find out if that's where we want to be."
"1694380","1695640"," I don't think that we reject here. "
"1695700","1697800"," I think that we trade higher to the 460 mark today."
"1697800","1701220"," And then I think we start to gain some consolidation, trade higher."
"1701660","1705160"," Now, if we get a hard rejection here, that's no bueno, right?"
"1705500","1708020"," If we look above and we get a hard rejection, that's no bueno. "
"1708220","1709220"," So just want to be aware of that."
"1709560","1711220"," Let this thing do its magic here."
"1711520","1714540"," And because you've got all this room that you can make money off here, okay?"
"1714860","1717420"," It's all kinds of room that you can get money off in here. "
"1717660","1722020"," There's all kinds of time in here for a bull to get trapped until the next move above."
"1722560","1725900"," I know you guys get ground up inside these areas in here."
"1725900","1729400"," I know, I don't know what you guys are doing yesterday afternoon or morning. "
"1729740","1734400"," But I guarantee that half of you are getting train wrecked inside the daily."
"1734720","1738560"," I'm not all of you, but I guarantee some of you are getting chewed ground up."
"1738680","1741020"," Yesterday was a grinder all day long. "
"1741180","1741680"," You guys know it."
"1741760","1742100"," I know it."
"1743400","1745320"," So anyways, just moving away from that. "
"1745440","1746480"," Let this happen today."
"1747240","1748380"," Let this trade higher."
"1748820","1749680"," There's a quick trade below. "
"1750220","1754820"," You can get down to this 45-40 or so right down here, 45-46."
"1754820","1756820"," If we have to trade that low, we'll try."
"1756940","1759820"," We'll look at that and see if we can take it higher and just see if we can break above. "
"1760520","1761900"," You guys are already long yesterday."
"1762000","1764080"," You can hang out inside your calls if you want to."
"1764340","1766200"," There's nothing wrong with staying in your calls. "
"1766400","1767820"," You guys bought yesterday at..."
"1768820","1770060"," What you guys buying yesterday?"
"1770320","1775260"," We bought this yesterday at 45-4034."
"1776060","1777160"," 45-03 yesterday."
"1777780","1778740"," That is pure insanity. "
"1779860","1781120"," Pure insanity yesterday."
"1781480","1782660"," So if you guys want to hang on, hang on."
"1783020","1784480"," You want to cut some loose and take some profit?"
"1784480","1785200"," That's what you do. "
"1785640","1789500"," If you guys have longer dated calls, more the power to you."
"1789880","1793180"," I just want you to realize that where we are here is a key rejection point."
"1793560","1797260"," Like these are points where we sell it down when we head here carrying the past. "
"1797800","1798900"," Just be conscious of that."
"1799360","1800560"," This is last chance for bears."
"1801080","1802320"," If bears can't do it here, right?"
"1802820","1805240"," We are going more than likely at all time highs up here. "
"1806120","1806780"," More than likely."
"1807340","1810080"," This is not part of the book, the bear case up here."
"1810400","1812180"," Nothing about this is part of the bear case. "
"1812180","1814420"," This is all the bull case above here."
"1814540","1817520"," So you get above here today and you can get super duper bullish."
"1817780","1819580"," And I will call myself bullish along with you. "
"1823050","1824390"," Playing test was bad then good."
"1826650","1830270"," Mary Gerez, or Mary Gerez, did you wind up buying that close yesterday with me?"
"1830370","1835490"," We were talking, it was like a, what, a dollar or no?"
"1835610","1837890"," It was like 4-12 or something, 4-10."
"1838710","1840690"," Did you end up buying some calls at the belly yesterday, Mary?"
"1841050","1841810"," I want to know. "
"1842950","1845110"," Because I know you listen until we log off here."
"1846670","1853510"," I want to know if Mary bought that one last time or not."
"1855850","1857270"," It was the wrong one here. "
"1857390","1857930"," What am I looking for?"
"1859130","1860010"," The news."
"1861350","1863970"," I'm going to unmute this."
"1865770","1867110"," I'm going to put this on here. "
"1882330","1883590"," Good morning, buddy Mac."
"1884650","1885510"," Good job, Mary."
"1885590","1886550"," Did you hold any calls overnight?"
"1887170","1891390"," If any of you are tuning in right now and you missed the beginning of the broadcast, it is"
"1891390","1895770"," important for you to go back and watch the beginning of the broadcast so you can get a firm"
"1895770","1899950"," understanding of where we are on the market so that you're ready for the 9.30 hour. "
"1900470","1902410"," You don't have to go back to the exact beginning and find out."
"1902650","1905050"," You can just go back to where I'm charting out."
"1905890","1910090"," At least the S, if not prior to when I was doing scribbles on a board. "
"1910090","1916330"," Just so you can get an idea of bullish, bearish, neutral, and then relay that into ES this morning"
"1916330","1919930"," so that you can look to trade the rest of your day today."
"1921830","1924270"," Let me know if you can hear the person."
"1925470","1926630"," You're going to hear a person. "
"1926970","1931790"," Also, I talk about we added a new benefit to the subscription today, the free subscription."
"1933310","1934930"," We added a new benefit today."
"1935550","1941210"," We're going to have a new squawk on when I'm not yapping my lap, my lips off to you guys. "
"1941730","1946210"," If I step away from the mic at a moment or from the stream, you guys are going to get"
"1946210","1950230"," the best period, the best new squawk available."
"1952090","1955510"," It could be annoying this morning where to leave it on just for the start so you guys get familiar"
"1955510","1955910"," with it."
"1957430","1959190"," I'll turn the volume down in the background. "
"1960410","1964970"," If I'm not on or if I just have the book map up and if I just have the new"
"1964970","1967930"," squawk on the background, it should be beneficial to you."
"1968090","1969230"," It'll take you some time."
"1969950","1975810"," But once you get a feel for market moving events, this guy does a really good job of knowing what"
"1975810","1978370"," to talk about and you'll see the market move. "
"1978570","1988390"," This stuff comes out before stuff comes out before Walter Bloomberg even posted on Twitter."
"1988930","1990070"," This stuff is badass."
"1992570","1994190"," We'll see if it's up and running here. "
"1994890","1996430"," Make sure it's actually planned."
"1996650","1997610"," It's now playing in the background."
"2000130","2001130"," Good job. "
"2002070","2003830"," Let the spy load up."
"2004170","2005170"," Let me know real quick."
"2008030","2011090"," This stuff costs $235 a month. "
"2011910","2012530"," I'll run this."
"2014050","2018790"," If Winky can talk to me at some point about getting a laptop, I'll run it."
"2019330","2024750"," I'll run a live stream on it just on its own inside of the Discord for you guys, so you"
"2024750","2031970"," guys always have it available in Discord or beyond every single trading day, so you guys can have"
"2031970","2032510"," actual information. "
"2032630","2038090"," I use this new squawk at key moments in the market, so today is a key moment."
"2038990","2043170"," I want to know what an analyst has to say."
"2043330","2044810"," There's a real pit trader. "
"2044810","2048030"," These guys have a previous experience as pit traders."
"2048190","2050389"," They know exactly what market moving information is."
"2054600","2058020"," Yeah, you won't hear the squawk unless it's something critical. "
"2058540","2059800"," Can you hear the beeps in the background?"
"2060159","2060639"," Do-do."
"2061120","2062020"," Can you hear that or not?"
"2063120","2064100"," Let me know if you can hear that."
"2066300","2067120"," Did you hear that?"
"2067920","2068620"," Do-do. "
"2069500","2076590"," I don't know if you hear that, but it sounds like do-do."
"2081030","2082889"," We'll talk about Google here in just a minute, too."
"2086840","2088320"," Did you guys hear the do-do-t?"
"2088600","2089920"," Like a little do-do-do in the background. "
"2090380","2091659"," It sounds like a pulse."
"2093860","2103780"," Okay, just hear a guy"
"2103780","2104940"," talking in the background this time."
"2124590","2126570"," Okay, so you heard a guy talking?"
"2129830","2130650"," Did you hear it?"
"2131290","2132590"," You heard a voice that was low?"
"2132810","2133630"," Okay, I got to hold on here. "
"2133730","2134510"," We turn it up."
"2135870","2137410"," You guys heard a little voice in the background?"
"2139370","2144930"," Okay, so that guy, right, is-that guy's a pro-old-school professional trader, okay?"
"2145410","2148470"," That guy's going to chime in at key moments in the day and he's going to talk."
"2148670","2152550"," It's not often, but when that guy is talking, right, he's going to call out. "
"2152550","2155790"," That MDM making a new loyalty rewards program."
"2156970","2158250"," He might go off like home."
"2162050","2165110"," He's telling you about the MGM or your rewards program that I might go up. "
"2165390","2166150"," You'll hear him."
"2166290","2167490"," Sometimes they'll swear and cuss."
"2168930","2170230"," Similar press release. "
"2170610","2174110"," At least similar press release yesterday in their MDM rewards program."
"2177030","2177850"," Hear that guy?"
"2180530","2181750"," Is it still faped?"
"2183010","2184770"," Oh my god, we turned this thing up."
"2187790","2188590"," Am I in?"
"2188690","2189510"," They can hear it really loud. "
"2190750","2197730"," It's the official saying that US forces will not deflate in Ukraine, and that these troop movements"
"2197730","2198430"," are temporary."
"2207960","2209580"," All right, I just turned it up again."
"2209580","2216180"," We'll see where the press release in the year with record electric and SUV sales momentum. "
"2217360","2217980"," First and left."
"2219660","2221260"," That's in January results."
"2225980","2230540"," For total vehicle sales for January 143.5,000."
"2232680","2235840"," Electrified vehicles at 13.2,000 for the month. "
"2239550","2240870"," Right, that was good, right?"
"2240870","2243810"," Total sales are about flat year of year."
"2244110","2247770"," Electrified vehicle sales of 167% for Ford in January."
"2251700","2252940"," That's the man right there. "
"2253400","2254320"," That guy is banging."
"2258270","2259410"," That guy is banging."
"2263290","2268390"," So you can disregard some of what he says, but when things get crazy, that guy will come on and"
"2268390","2273270"," just be like, that guy will come on and be like, pay attention right now to the spy. "
"2273270","2274670"," Pay attention right now to Tesla."
"2275030","2276990"," Pay attention right now to he could use."
"2279350","2280610"," No, he doesn't. "
"2281130","2286430"," So what he does is he gets the headlines in like he'll get like 40 50 60 headlines and he"
"2286430","2290910"," actually goes through them all and figures out what matters and what doesn't."
"2294540","2295960"," Yeah, he figures."
"2296300","2300740"," So he'll only read to you what is critical, not all the other fluff. "
"2300740","2305900"," So you're not having to pay attention to the stream that comes through."
"2306540","2308820"," And you're not having to decipher what matters."
"2309360","2315200"," So when you guys see like Walter Bloomberg say something that actually matters, he's that same kind"
"2315200","2315440"," of guy. "
"2324320","2325960"," So I won't have this guy on all the time."
"2326700","2331540"," But if I'm not here, I'll put him on so there's a voice in the background given you guys actionable"
"2331540","2334560"," stuff to talk about, right?"
"2338390","2339850"," Well, there's different kinds, right?"
"2340370","2342490"," So there's different kinds."
"2342950","2347810"," So like Ben Zinga Charlie from Ben Zinga, everyone says that he gets paid to pump shit. "
"2349670","2352470"," So I didn't want to put him on plus his news is always late."
"2352830","2354450"," There's other guys out there that do it."
"2354930","2360510"," But I always find as though they're they take too long to get through the news. "
"2361070","2365770"," So like I'll get like a post from from Walter Bloomberg or the marker will already react."
"2366930","2370530"," And so the news isn't isn't tradable."
"2371190","2376690"," So this is the only new service I've ever used that I can get that puts the news out that"
"2376690","2380370"," that matters before anyone else before anybody anybody. "
"2381150","2383310"," Anybody I don't care what service you're using."
"2383310","2385090"," I don't care if it's probably a text."
"2385850","2391050"," I don't care if it's from Thinkorswim or from anybody out there. "
"2391050","2392230"," This is the fastest."
"2393090","2395230"," What's relevant news there is."
"2395370","2400510"," Matter of fact, they're the oldest news squawk internet news squawk in existence. "
"2400510","2407790"," They've been doing it since at least 2000 at least at least two decades."
"2412170","2412690"," Yeah."
"2412810","2415350"," So I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the sonar beep. "
"2416190","2423310"," The sonar beep is the texting and I can't figure out yet how to get rid of that aspect of"
"2423310","2423430"," it."
"2423430","2424270"," So I got to work on that."
"2424430","2426710"," I got to try to mute that and get just his voice. "
"2427410","2428370"," That's a work in progress."
"2430990","2432870"," Eventually, if Winky and I end up doing the."
"2434130","2435790"," If Winky and I end up doing the. "
"2436770","2441890"," The stream from just this guy will keep it separate so that you guys don't want us until you don't"
"2441890","2444010"," have to if you want to listen to you can."
"2449050","2454590"," U.S. send their talks with China, Japan, India about sending gas supplies to Europe."
"2455790","2465700"," It's an effort to present a European energy shortage with"
"2465700","2466880"," the Ukraine crisis. "
"2468860","2472960"," So that has to do with Russia turn the gas back on into Germany."
"2473300","2476560"," Everyone in Germany said they were only selling helmets or sending helmets to Ukraine."
"2476560","2480720"," I started to see the talk of moving from negotiations from full-out war. "
"2481300","2482620"," From a total war right."
"2483340","2484720"," Get a nice support down here."
"2485280","2487260"," You can see the buyers stepping in right below here. "
"2487920","2490200"," I'm going to add the connections here for."
"2490440","2491040"," It's a 921."
"2491280","2493940"," We've got nine minutes left into the trading hour. "
"2494740","2495340"," So we're going to."
"2496860","2498280"," We're going to put on."
"2499960","2500980"," To be pretty badass. "
"2501240","2501820"," Do we get this thing?"
"2502060","2504200"," We get this guy loaded up into the discord."
"2504840","2507460"," You can put to a voice channel with just him chit chatting."
"2508040","2511660"," And you can plug him into your surround sound at home or something like that. "
"2513200","2514780"," And this guy knows his shit."
"2521470","2523550"," Yeah, it's called trade the news."
"2525010","2526010"," Trade the news. "
"2526490","2529610"," If you guys wait, I'll get you a link where we can pay for it cheaper."
"2531070","2532010"," Don't wait to sign up."
"2533510","2535670"," Because if we get a link, we can probably get it cheaper. "
"2535950","2537710"," Right now it's costing me an arm and a leg."
"2540030","2541130"," It's like $235."
"2544430","2546810"," Yeah, the new Ukraine news is a wild car for the market. "
"2546950","2551530"," This guy all morning long has been building a story."
"2552070","2553750"," Basically that we're not going to fight with Ukraine."
"2556930","2557850"," Big news though. "
"2558330","2559750"," I want you guys to be careful today."
"2559750","2560930"," $10.30, okay."
"2561630","2564550"," Could see some weakness come into the market as we hit that $10.30 hour. "
"2568240","2571240"," You know that bears last stand is today, right?"
"2572160","2574520"," You know that people are going to take protection today."
"2574520","2577840"," You know that there's going to be FOMO."
"2578680","2581120"," You know that the traders and investors didn't catch yesterday. "
"2583140","2584540"," So they're going to want to get in today."
"2584620","2586120"," So they're going to talk you down all morning long."
"2586300","2587620"," They're going to want it to trade down. "
"2587620","2589440"," So they want, they all want it down to $450."
"2591180","2593300"," $451, $452, $453."
"2593680","2596060"," So they can get a buy in so we can trade it to $460. "
"2596480","2598680"," They want in to be aware of that too."
"2598820","2604220"," You've got all these forces working towards you, not getting your profit today."
"2604620","2605380"," That's what they want. "
"2606100","2608160"," We'll talk about Google at some point this morning as well."
"2608700","2613540"," You're going to hear people out there talking about how Google shouldn't be trading the side."
"2613540","2614920"," They're P's only like 26. "
"2615780","2616040"," Right?"
"2616580","2619060"," Everybody wants it to trade at 100 bucks a share, right?"
"2619240","2621760"," Or 90 bucks a share, two for one at GMC."
"2621960","2627040"," You know, in a press interview saying that customer demand is causing them to pull forward EV"
"2627040","2627440"," production."
"2631250","2633410"," So you've got everybody trying to tell you this. "
"2633490","2634190"," Let's talk to reality."
"2634210","2634690"," Okay."
"2634850","2639390"," The same that growth investments will take priority over any future dividends. "
"2640550","2641030"," Oh."
"2642390","2644070"," GM, GM double and down."
"2646070","2646970"," Fuck the dividends. "
"2648750","2651190"," Now we got stinky, stinky investors."
"2651830","2653070"," Now, let's talk about Google."
"2653510","2655010"," Just, I think, just get back on Google, right?"
"2655590","2662230"," There ain't no way Google's going to be trading at 100 fucking dollars for anybody on a 21 stock"
"2662230","2662570"," split. "
"2662750","2665350"," I don't care if this split ain't until June or July."
"2665350","2671470"," Imagine TCH on their conference call saying that they plan to roll out Tinder coins globally by"
"2671470","2672290"," 2023."
"2672670","2674070"," Michael, think of Charlie Hotel. "
"2675940","2685300"," There ain't no way that Google's trading at 100 fuck dollars a share or $130 a share if it does"
"2685300","2686160"," buy it all."
"2686740","2690520"," And I know all the bullshit about, oh, yeah, you know, it's the same price."
"2690540","2694400"," You can buy it if you can't afford, you know, $3,000 calls. "
"2694400","2700400"," You'll be able to just buy whatever, like a fucking Robinhood thing where you buy a percentage,"
"2700720","2700780"," right?"
"2701240","2702580"," You buy just a portion of a share."
"2702760","2703540"," That's all horseshit."
"2703920","2705360"," You all, I know all of you. "
"2705580","2710220"," I know all of you want to own just straight shares of Google at $100."
"2711380","2712560"," Don't tell me you don't."
"2718380","2719720"," Oh, you guys saying about a..."
"2721780","2723060"," You should be getting paid eight times. "
"2723500","2725660"," Yeah, I don't think I have some of this stuff."
"2725960","2726260"," It's weird."
"2726260","2729740"," I don't do the affiliate links. "
"2730320","2732760"," Like some of them want me to come into a partnership for them."
"2732840","2735120"," They want me to fucking lie for them and stupid shit like that."
"2735280","2736160"," I ain't doing any of that noise. "
"2738540","2741220"," But I think there might be a partnership for trade."
"2741400","2742540"," The news, I just haven't looked at it."
"2743000","2744240"," Like one where it's just easy. "
"2744920","2748420"," You set a link and it helps to doffset the cost every month."
"2748560","2749740"," If anyone wants to pay for it."
"2749740","2752840"," If I've been to the open bill in New York, it's a few futures. "
"2753460","2755300"," Indicating a higher open up."
"2756300","2757500"," Not a sixth sense of one person."
"2759360","2760380"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"2761120","2763400"," S&P 500 indicating a stronger."
"2763700","2764020"," Your eyes."
"2766580","2769060"," Yes, I do. "
"2775140","2775860"," Hey, everybody."
"2776460","2778360"," Yeah, I just thought I just mentioned it."
"2778500","2780640"," I know that's what's not until June, July. "
"2780640","2781800"," You are crazy."
"2782560","2785940"," If you think Google will be at a hundred bucks in June or July."
"2788420","2789160"," Yeah, sponsorship. "
"2789740","2793700"," I have to navigate like, I have to navigate so much shit right now."
"2793860","2800480"," I just found out that because I don't charge or I don't because I don't launch advertising on"
"2800480","2807480"," YouTube, that there's a fair chance that people are being told no, they can't watch my stream."
"2809120","2811580"," You wouldn't notice it, but like a new viewer. "
"2811980","2813760"," It only allows me to have so many new viewers."
"2814000","2814920"," It's all fucked up right now."
"2815020","2815260"," So whatever. "
"2816080","2816360"," Whatever."
"2817320","2818800"," I'll show you guys that later today."
"2820260","2821220"," Because I'm not advertising. "
"2823580","2825820"," Yes, I can tweet spy levels for you."
"2826240","2827580"," The one I'm going to show you some."
"2828700","2830040"," Let me see if I can do a quick. "
"2831220","2831580"," Quick."
"2837320","2838060"," Here, hold on a second here."
"2886840","2887840"," Okay, so no. "
"2889880","2894940"," No, uh, typed levels this morning for you, but I have an intern."
"2895540","2897780"," An unpaid intern that's promised me."
"2898380","2900880"," She's going to post them regular everyday for you. "
"2901840","2906480"," Unless she's not in school, but she will be putting those up for you every morning."
"2907760","2909060"," I have to pay her, of course."
"2909440","2910060"," She's not unpaid. "
"2910700","2911480"," I'm paying her for this."
"2912120","2913700"," So I'm going to start paying her."
"2913700","2915060"," Well, she's very smart too. "
"2915180","2916880"," She's skipped grade."
"2917100","2917620"," She's high honors."
"2918240","2920940"," I promised her that I would pay her if she lent me a hand. "
"2925700","2929340"," He sees, did I look into Will Meade's Tweedex hunch fun guy?"
"2930300","2932060"," He sees profit taking in the queue."
"2932260","2932360"," Yeah."
"2933060","2936020"," Well, you know, I'm taking profit at the bell. "
"2937700","2939040"," I'm taking profit at the bell."
"2940540","2941200"," Yum painter."
"2941900","2942160"," I am. "
"2943300","2944540"," I promise I'm paying her."
"2944540","2946080"," I'll bring her on once a week."
"2946920","2951160"," I'll bring her on once a week so she can say she got paid or not. "
"2951400","2951960"," I promise."
"2955860","2956660"," Hold on."
"2956800","2958820"," I got to get ready to sell. "
"2961600","2964260"," Yeah, I don't know what Will Meade is doing out there."
"2964620","2965680"," Will Meade's telling you."
"2969950","2972650"," Yeah, we should get a boomerang's channel. "
"2974170","2977190"," You know what, Winky, I got to make you a mod in there, bro."
"2981900","2982620"," Oh, no."
"2982860","2984160"," So I opened up the options chain. "
"2984560","2987260"," I've done my research on what the price should be at the opening bell."
"2989840","2990640"," I'm ready to go."
"2990800","2994180"," He is saying that the bolt battery problem has been corrected. "
"2995720","2998740"," It says the bolt will be part of GM's near term future."
"3006990","3007530"," All right."
"3007530","3015260"," So Will Meade is telling you he wants in. "
"3015740","3018560"," That's why he's telling you people are taking profit on the queues."
"3020340","3021820"," And do I think Google trades down?"
"3022140","3022920"," Yeah, trades down."
"3023060","3024940"," They'll be profit taking off the queues. "
"3025480","3026480"," Or excuse me, off Google this morning."
"3027120","3030840"," But I promise you that people want to, they want in."
"3032300","3033360"," That they want in. "
"3033560","3035300"," Most of these moves have been made."
"3035560","3035840"," Hold on here."
"3095910","3096370"," Sweet. "
"3098850","3099370"," Hello."
"3114060","3117040"," I caught $1.96 on 455 C's."
"3118700","3121020"," I think the last time I bought them was at 120. "
"3122320","3124080"," I like for 10."
"3124260","3125620"," They're at $1.84 right now."
"3126900","3132620"," At the bell there are $1.20. I think we originally bought them at 60 cents and traded them three"
"3132620","3134640"," or four times or something like that yesterday. "
"3135680","3137040"," They're at $1.80 now."
"3137040","3141560"," At no point should you be down right now in those 455 C's."
"3146100","3147600"," Let's stretch this out a little bit. "
"3147760","3148780"," Sorry, I had to take some profit."
"3149560","3150260"," Take my money."
"3153360","3157020"," Let's take a look at where we are if we're going to trade lower or not. "
"3157940","3159360"," Or how low we made trade."
"3163690","3168530"," There are some put buying going on right now, but it's all small stuff."
"3168530","3170090"," It's not algo driven. "
"3170330","3173410"," It's like there's like 8,000 contracts on 454 P."
"3173910","3177210"," It looks more like trying to find a dip."
"3177970","3181850"," We like someone by QQQ's puts, but 50 K, that's it."
"3182410","3188670"," NVIDIA tons of calls coming in February 4th, 250 C, 252.5 C, 260 C."
"3189190","3192870"," All February 4th for $600,000. "
"3193530","3197150"," A little bit of NVIDIA puts coming in for $74,000 off the bell at 930."
"3198030","3202910"," But generally speaking right now, not seeing a ton of moving either way."
"3203090","3207750"," This looks more currently for the opening bell for the first five minutes, like we're going to be"
"3207750","3208390"," trading up here. "
"3208650","3211730"," A more NVIDIA calls coming in currently right now."
"3212210","3213630"," Lots of volatility on the bell."
"3214030","3216030"," This is when people are making their decisions right. "
"3216710","3218650"," You got overnight traders trying to take profit."
"3219230","3221290"," You've got FOMO bulls trying to buy in right here."
"3221670","3222770"," You're going to look for some levels below. "
"3223010","3224370"," You've got 454, 10."
"3224370","3226890"," You've got 454, 59."
"3227890","3230130"," If you want to look a little bit lower, see if there's any other. "
"3230630","3234330"," You get a nice sport building down here right off the bell, right?"
"3234990","3237830"," You can see buyers down below at 453 and 450."
"3238590","3240910"," You might not even get down here right now, okay?"
"3241730","3245090"," You've got more buyers than, excuse me, you've got slightly more sellers than buyers."
"3245410","3248230"," You've got slightly negative hero indicator right off the bell. "
"3249070","3252010"," Maybe we can get a nice little dip here to get another buying opportunity."
"3265740","3268160"," More NVIDIA calls coming in right now."
"3268260","3273060"," So off the bell at 9th, since 930, it's been NVIDIA, NVIDIA, NVIDIA, NVIDIA. "
"3274380","3279280"," More NVIDIA calls February 4th, 250C, $170,000."
"3280200","3284300"," NVIDIA on February 4th, 255C for $291,000."
"3285620","3286480"," Currently the call structure. "
"3286800","3291120"," Sometimes when I see this many calls right off the bell, it's more geared towards profit taking,"
"3291280","3291600"," not always."
"3291600","3296460"," But I frequently don't like seeing this many calls right at 930."
"3296940","3300420"," And so right off the bell, we have NVIDIA six orders for $1.4 million. "
"3301580","3311560"," For all for February 4th, float around 250 to 260, 250, 255, 252.5. Verizon has one"
"3311560","3316720"," call on it, INTC, BA, BP, DKNG, and SOFI."
"3317280","3321000"," We'll make a note this morning that usually we see more flow at this point."
"3321000","3324140"," And it's very light action right now. "
"3324280","3325440"," So be careful of that."
"3326940","3330090"," Currently we've got 95% bullishness."
"3330880","3335020"," Put the call ratio is .269, which is pretty good, right?"
"3335160","3338420"," You've got 12,000 calls versus 3,000 puts. "
"3339420","3341900"," We do have some calls coming in on XOP."
"3342520","3345140"," I think that's an energy trade."
"3345980","3346360"," No, it's an ETF. "
"3346800","3350980"," Is that an ETF?"
"3350980","3355740"," XOP, February 11th, 111C for $384,000."
"3358880","3361740"," Yeah, baby, that's spider, oil, and gas exploration."
"3362960","3365960"," So that's trading on some small pec news coming out of 1030. "
"3366160","3367900"," That's a gambler's bet right there."
"3368660","3375780"," XOP, X-ray, O-P, $384,000, 111C."
"3377220","3382260"," Next up, we've got the spy, February 2nd, 460C, $215,000. "
"3383400","3386940"," PFE, February 18th, 55C for $79,000."
"3387220","3389580"," Looks like we've got some dip buyers trying to step up here."
"3390200","3393820"," I'm still interested in waiting on one more little bit of a dip here. "
"3394340","3395960"," I want to see us trade down to this."
"3396380","3397820"," See this smart money down here?"
"3398220","3401160"," 2, 4, 54, 80, 4, 55."
"3402480","3403500"," Quick little dip down. "
"3403820","3404600"," See this down here?"
"3404720","3407140"," This is yellow here, forming up, 4, 54, 40."
"3407800","3413260"," See these sellers stepping in above right here, right at 4, 55, 4, 56, 4, 55, 80."
"3413840","3416020"," You want to see some of these people get worn out right here. "
"3418290","3419690"," And now watching some spy puts."
"3421390","3426070"," February 4th, 453P, $268,000."
"3427770","3432430"," More Nvidia calls, February 4th, 255C for $200,000. "
"3433170","3435090"," Nvidia, Nvidia, Nvidia is where it's at."
"3436350","3442830"," The price target, ultimately above today, is 4, 6, 0, 4, 6, 0."
"3449340","3450580"," Good to see you all."
"3450680","3451160"," Good morning, Chris. "
"3455530","3458950"," We'll look for a price target above right now and see if we can actually see a target."
"3459590","3461170"," See lots of sellers up here, too."
"3461270","3462370"," You don't usually see this, right?"
"3463170","3464390"," See lots of traffic here. "
"3464850","3466630"," This is a point of contention, right?"
"3466630","3470490"," If we trade above into this, you can see it, right?"
"3470870","3472830"," This is going to be all traffic up in here."
"3473290","3478350"," This is going to be all kinds of people that want to sell, right?"
"3479030","3480590"," This is unusual for us to see."
"3480670","3484330"," This is because we are at the top of a major trend resistance point. "
"3484930","3488050"," And what I always try to talk to you guys about is maybe waiting for this to happen."
"3488610","3493610"," If you wait for the banks to trade us up, you guys can get into this trade up to 460."
"3493670","3495170"," I'm not saying don't take that trade. "
"3495170","3498270"," I'm just saying that this is a danger zone, right?"
"3498590","3502630"," Those big moves that you see when we trade 30, 40, 60, 100 points."
"3503050","3506510"," They're usually not in this area where we are right now, okay?"
"3507390","3510330"," So I'm going to look for a pick up a trade here long this morning."
"3510870","3511750"," I'm going to wait, though. "
"3512170","3518150"," I want to see if we trade back down to 45354."
"3519250","3524450"," I think if we can trade down there today and then grab it, get a whole bunch of bulls to"
"3524450","3525950"," hop on board and ride us up higher."
"3527010","3529030"," But I might miss that trade at this point. "
"3530470","3531850"," Qcom calls coming in this morning."
"3532830","3536310"," Qcom, February 11th, 200c, $115,000."
"3537130","3539690"," More Nvidia calls, and then we've got more spy calls here. "
"3540450","3543110"," February 2nd, 456c for $82,000."
"3545660","3549460"," And before the uploading bell is more, we talked about a quick sell off off the bell."
"3550020","3551740"," And then a quick rip up within the first 20 minutes. "
"3551740","3553720"," Looks like we're getting that at this point."
"3554140","3555080"," We are trading higher."
"3555580","3557200"," There is a little bit of a resistance here. "
"3557280","3558320"," Why you pay attention to it?"
"3558660","3560680"," It's at 45644."
"3561960","3562360"," 464644."
"3563040","3564880"," Be careful up here as you trade higher. "
"3565260","3569720"," If you did miss selling your calls off the bell, this is a good time to take profit up here."
"3575740","3577200"," Oh, I haven't looked at a Peton."
"3580200","3581100"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"3581240","3581800"," Bye bye, Peton."
"3582400","3586200"," Also be aware of IWM is looking weak this morning as well."
"3593770","3595590"," Yeah, HUD is looking weak as well. "
"3596350","3598550"," Looks like IWM is not looking too healthy right now."
"3600650","3601950"," Good eyes on that one, Joe."
"3605520","3606940"," More calls coming in on Nvidia. "
"3607700","3610820"," February 11th, 265c for $165,000."
"3611280","3612620"," Calls on MU as well."
"3613400","3616640"," Be careful of MU too, you know, because MU is part of an IWM. "
"3617600","3620740"," February 4th, I83c, $102,000."
"3621800","3630680"," It looks like there's some selling in the underlying of IWM this morning."
"3631200","3632060"," Be careful of that. "
"3632100","3636400"," Okay, that can be a sign of bad things for the spy."
"3636820","3639040"," I want you to see this to pay attention to this too, right?"
"3639640","3641700"," You see this selling pressure above here?"
"3642700","3644360"," Right here, 464648."
"3644840","3647200"," Seeing the sellers step right in above here. "
"3647380","3649780"," Be careful of this currently."
"3650560","3652320"," Here indicator is positive at this point."
"3652900","3655400"," We do have more buyers than sellers right now. "
"3657410","3661110"," We have more queues, calls coming in February 2nd, 371c."
"3663760","3665620"," How do you guys like this broadcast so far, this morning?"
"3665880","3665980"," Okay."
"3666520","3667080"," Yeah, baby. "
"3667340","3668040"," Right blood, Joe."
"3668220","3669600"," There is blood in the water on Peton."
"3670020","3671940"," There ain't no way that they're getting out of this. "
"3672600","3673880"," There's just no way."
"3674400","3676180"," I don't want to hear it from Peton."
"3677420","3678960"," All this noise from Peton. "
"3679140","3680000"," I'm telling you what, right?"
"3680580","3685920"," Like Peton and the bullshit that they have talking about their ER and like all the..."
"3685920","3689140"," We got more puts coming in right now across the board."
"3689440","3696800"," Fubu puts, spy puts, IWM puts, spy 453P February 4th."
"3697680","3698600"," $300,000. "
"3699560","3707360"," Fubu puts, two racks, February 4th, 11.5P. GPS puts, a lot of puts on like IWM crap."
"3707660","3711100"," And then I got more IWM puts February 2nd, 202P."
"3711800","3713100"," Just a quick fire rack off. "
"3713100","3717090"," Oh, thanks, Desperato."
"3718430","3719470"," Right on, right on."
"3720450","3721330"," PayPal's getting wrecked. "
"3721790","3722410"," I'll have to look at PayPal."
"3726680","3727560"," Oh, PayPal."
"3728700","3730280"," Oh, PayPal, really?"
"3731380","3732160"," Come on, bro. "
"3734400","3735440"," Oh, no."
"3738160","3740840"," I just went back to like the chart plate chart at Peton."
"3741600","3744820"," I just took back on my chart plate chart and Peton and..."
"3746320","3746800"," Shit. "
"3747580","3752900"," I think my price target was like 96 to 88."
"3753480","3758040"," But I didn't want to see that actual 86 to 98 or 96 to 88 price."
"3760340","3764180"," And I'll tell you what, looking at it right here at 133. "
"3765860","3770200"," Might as well just, you know, take the rest off and start from scratch, right?"
"3771760","3772260"," Terrible."
"3773660","3774160"," Terrible."
"3774360","3774460"," PayPal. "
"3778140","3779920"," Like, you know, it makes me think of it."
"3780000","3780780"," It makes me think of it."
"3780860","3781480"," Do you guys remember when..."
"3782180","3783800"," I don't know how far back this was. "
"3784480","3786460"," Do you guys remember, like, when..."
"3788340","3788740"," Shit."
"3788960","3789400"," What was it?"
"3790740","3792440"," You guys remember when..."
"3793800","3794880"," Like, was it in?"
"3795040","3795400"," No, on Instagram."
"3795860","3796600"," What was the other..."
"3796600","3801640"," It was like Twitter and like some other social media just kept getting whacked. "
"3801640","3803820"," This was years ago, like three or four years ago."
"3804500","3805640"," Like, they just weren't..."
"3805640","3806400"," They didn't have a bid."
"3808100","3809040"," It wasn't Instagram. "
"3809680","3814240"," I don't know what it was, but it's like one of the shitty social media stocks."
"3815200","3816500"," And it was just horrible."
"3817060","3818840"," It was like Twitter was like that too, right?"
"3819300","3823500"," Twitter's been like the redhead stepchild of the stock market forever as well, right?"
"3823780","3826920"," Or there was a time when Twitter was getting beaten up. "
"3828560","3829740"," I'm gonna look back."
"3831200","3832680"," Yeah, like 20 bucks."
"3833140","3834620"," Twitter was at $20. "
"3835100","3836480"," It was like $15."
"3837580","3838460"," Like $14."
"3839320","3839760"," $13. "
"3840500","3842540"," Back in like the 2000s and shit."
"3842920","3844660"," Like 2017, dude."
"3845080","3848020"," It's like Twitter was at like $55 or something stupid. "
"3848640","3850180"," And then it traded all the way down to like $13."
"3850700","3854780"," I don't know how long you guys been on this market, but tell you what, back then, it was crazy."
"3855840","3857440"," I remember like spending summers, right?"
"3857440","3861140"," And everyone would just like everybody had all his wild dreams about Twitter. "
"3861300","3862020"," Just go into the moon."
"3862340","3863260"," That didn't happen."
"3863540","3865300"," Lots of spy puts coming in right now. "
"3866480","3867660"," Ooh, PayPal."
"3869100","3871000"," May 20th, 140 C."
"3872800","3874740"," $900,000 high algo score."
"3875320","3876080"," I don't know though. "
"3876460","3877460"," And I'll tell you what, right?"
"3877700","3879080"," Those are probably printed in May."
"3879980","3882420"," But I think that's still some life catching right there."
"3882900","3884620"," I might let it cool off for a minute. "
"3884620","3884860"," Okay."
"3884900","3887240"," Before you let them ring out the price of those."
"3887500","3889360"," You're like, you know, let's shake it out a little bit. "
"3890400","3892320"," Lots of spy puts coming in right now."
"3892840","3894220"," Still all localized, though."
"3894400","3894940"," Small stuff, right?"
"3895120","3897540"," Like spy February 2nd, 455 P."
"3897960","3904720"," $92,000 spy February 2nd for 455 P."
"3904960","3905720"," $200,000. "
"3906320","3911780"," Another rack of PayPal calls coming in May 20th, 140 C for $545,000."
"3911780","3914080"," Maybe we do see a bounce at this point."
"3914460","3915240"," I don't know though. "
"3915340","3916360"," You know how this goes, right?"
"3917580","3918660"," Man, like PayPal."
"3920000","3922220"," Maybe you get a relief rally for a couple days."
"3923080","3925540"," And then it just trades sideways. "
"3927020","3928660"," It just trades sideways."
"3929020","3929880"," Man, $130,000."
"3930080","3931180"," Those dirt cheap, isn't it?"
"3932260","3932760"," Dirt cheap. "
"3934020","3935840"," $130 on PayPal right now."
"3936400","3939560"," You got almost $1.4 million in calls for May."
"3940500","3940780"," May 20th. "
"3942480","3942980"," Whoo."
"3944260","3944760"," Terrible."
"3946340","3947400"," I can't believe it. "
"3947480","3948400"," I'm like, I'm like."
"3950480","3951870"," It was at $180."
"3956000","3956500"," $180. "
"3958500","3961620"," I do want you to be aware of this morning on the spy, okay?"
"3962320","3975140"," That if it trades, if it trades below, if it trades below 451, 451,"
"3975140","3978900"," 81450, it's starting to get into the danger zone."
"3979060","3979180"," Okay."
"3979680","3982840"," You want to see a healthy bounce this morning on the spy. "
"3982980","3988180"," You want to see, you know, a nice bounce down below, like 452, 58."
"3988720","3992060"," Maybe even down to 451, 81, but you don't want to see a break below it."
"3992720","3995800"," And you can see it actually just forming up as I was just talking. "
"3996460","3999440"," You can see a price target down below at 453, 12."
"4000600","4002480"," It's a nice support area down here."
"4003040","4008220"," If you see a bounce down below here, 453, and then we trade it higher, that does make sense. "
"4008560","4013020"," If we start breaking down below, that can become very dangerous for the spy."
"4013940","4023160"," Now seeing Tesla puts him in February 4, 900p, $700,000 on one of those contracts and then 500,000"
"4023160","4023620"," on the other."
"4024980","4027880"," That's a 900p February 4."
"4034060","4035700"," It's okay for a firm down with it. "
"4036000","4041060"," A lot of people talk about knife catching paypal on Twitter."
"4042100","4045000"," It's tough because let's say."
"4047680","4049300"," Peetons could be played right now. "
"4049560","4050340"," Holy shit."
"4050500","4050880"," Peeton."
"4051400","4053660"," Oh, I got to take my boots. "
"4056290","4057450"," I think it goes lower."
"4058150","4059650"," I think it goes from my put."
"4059850","4060270"," Oh, yeah. "
"4061070","4061690"," Oh, yeah."
"4061690","4062210"," Peeton."
"4062730","4064810"," I think it's being day traded heavily right now. "
"4065290","4069070"," I think Peeton into, I think it's going to get ugly."
"4069310","4072170"," I think it's going to get down to like 10 bucks, 12 bucks."
"4074490","4075010"," Excuse me. "
"4077030","4079490"," I think it gets ugly."
"4082360","4084180"," Netflix puts be conscious."
"4084440","4086480"," Okay, guys, be careful out there in the queues. "
"4086820","4089320"," Be careful out there on spy at this point."
"4089320","4091520"," You're seeing some weakness in IWM."
"4092440","4095800"," And now seeing puts on Tesla, right?"
"4096080","4096620"," A million bucks. "
"4097040","4098279"," A little bit more than a million bucks."
"4098740","4103279"," And now seeing Netflix puts a million dollars split twice."
"4103979","4104520"," Holy shit. "
"4105140","4105859"," Here we go."
"4106399","4106880"," Spy."
"4108439","4109500"," February 22nd. "
"4110020","4110700"," $450p."
"4111520","4112740"," $4 million."
"4114120","4115600"," For February 22nd. "
"4116500","4117020"," $4 million."
"4118240","4118479"," Golden ticket."
"4119640","4120479"," $450p. "
"4122800","4124979"," Going to recommend that you don't knife catch."
"4125479","4128420"," At least allow this hedge to impact the market."
"4129899","4131520"," This is for February 22nd. "
"4132760","4133359"," $450p."
"4133700","4134040"," $4 million."
"4134660","4135720"," This is close dated. "
"4137319","4138560"," Just after it."
"4138740","4141700"," Somebody just bought a February 2nd."
"4141880","4144779"," $4.55. $74,000. "
"4145880","4150439"," More than likely you're going to see some dealer hedging that will impact the price of spy right"
"4150439","4150680"," now."
"4151460","4153880"," You're going to see the dealers kick in right now."
"4154120","4156380"," And they are going to more than likely send it lower. "
"4157359","4158359"," It's going to be a bruise."
"4158880","4159840"," More Nvidia calls."
"4162200","4164200"," Nvidia $500,000. "
"4165399","4166660"," February 4th, 250c."
"4167580","4169560"," IWM puts $29,000."
"4170660","4171939"," February 2nd, 200p. "
"4173319","4174319"," Be careful here."
"4177200","4178560"," Take some money off the table."
"4191410","4193370"," Those are some big boy pants right there. "
"4193650","4197430"," February 22nd, 450p for $4 million."
"4201040","4202340"," It's going to leave a mark."
"4204960","4206480"," They're still blasting Nvidia. "
"4207300","4208800"," I don't understand the Nvidia."
"4209400","4210880"," I don't understand it."
"4212440","4217640"," If there's anything right, I got to give Nvidia right now is trading like Tesla. "
"4218860","4220260"," They just don't care."
"4221100","4222000"," I mean, look at that."
"4222060","4223620"," Sell off on Nvidia right now. "
"4224240","4225340"," Savage sell off."
"4226120","4226600"," Savage."
"4227720","4229420"," And they bought yesterday's dip too. "
"4229520","4230380"," They bought yesterday's dip."
"4230600","4233740"," I mean, Nvidia's trading like a penny stock."
"4234360","4235140"," Just look at it. "
"4235240","4238460"," Look at like a two day chart on Nvidia right now."
"4239460","4240380"," This is abnormal."
"4241500","4243740"," Just look at like a five day chart on Nvidia. "
"4244560","4246660"," Shit was trading at $2.38, right?"
"4248800","4258320"," It's now down to $2.50. Apple puts February 11th, 172 "
"4258320","4261180",".5 for $200,000."
"4261480","4268100"," Facebook puts February 18th, 300p for $400,000."
"4268500","4272880"," SE February 4th, 150p for $296,000. "
"4273580","4275140"," So some healthy puts coming in right now."
"4277520","4279120"," We'll see how low we trade though."
"4279300","4279760"," I don't know. "
"4280140","4280660"," It's not."
"4281140","4284960"," I don't like to spy $4 million puts, but it makes sense, right?"
"4285160","4286260"," We're coming into OPEC's."
"4286660","4288100"," We always sell off in OPEC's. "
"4288840","4289960"," It's kind of regular, isn't it?"
"4293420","4295580"," Yeah, Nvidia is trading wild right now."
"4295740","4297300"," It looks like straight wild."
"4297940","4300300"," It looks straight wild right now. "
"4302730","4309590"," AMD calls coming in February 18th, 124c, $662,000."
"4310750","4313130"," Nvidia's trading like a firm was trading a few months ago."
"4313970","4314670"," Straight up. "
"4314950","4315550"," Don't get wrecked."
"4316470","4323050"," Twitter puts coming in February 4th, 38p, speak of the devil for $101,000."
"4324010","4325270"," Nice little bouncer in the spy. "
"4326510","4328210"," Nice little bounce there in the spy."
"4328550","4329110"," I don't know though."
"4329250","4330590"," That $4 million, I don't like it. "
"4333230","4334850"," I'm having a hard time with that this morning."
"4335370","4337410"," I'm not trusting it right now."
"4338310","4343690"," I don't like seeing like a $4 million put come in against the spy and think that's the only, the"
"4343690","4344810"," only dump that there's going to be. "
"4345370","4346830"," I'm going to hang tight here."
"4347650","4350430"," I'm going to be looking to grab a bottom down here around 450."
"4352450","4353390"," I might miss it. "
"4354330","4354770"," Oh, wait."
"4358880","4359560"," Nvidia's trade."
"4359800","4360040"," I'm kidding. "
"4360060","4362340"," I like videos trading like a penny stock."
"4363440","4367020"," You have to have gift of balls of steel to trade in Nvidia right now."
"4369970","4370930"," Balls of steel. "
"4372170","4372770"," I don't know."
"4372890","4374190"," Yeah, that's one other thing."
"4375070","4382770"," Like the pay offs on spy versus a stock in time and in the market. "
"4383150","4391530"," I guess sometimes they pay pretty well on outside or like OTM dailies or weaklies."
"4391850","4393570"," I don't know why."
"4394350","4399430"," I feel like you can get caught trapped instead of a stock so much more easier than you can in"
"4399430","4399730"," the spy. "
"4403290","4404930"," We got a negative hero indicator."
"4405670","4407530"," We've got more sellers than buyers still."
"4407850","4409370"," Still some consolidation on the spy. "
"4410170","4411130"," Let this cool off."
"4413030","4420850"," I'm going to, I'm going to take a break here this morning and if you have another chance to go"
"4420850","4423630"," back, pause this broadcast, go back, see the opening."
"4424570","4425510"," We talked about this morning. "
"4427650","4429990"," Also, I think I got this."
"4430370","4431650"," I haven't heard that guy talk at all."
"4432490","4433990"," We'll find out why that guy is not talking. "
"4437300","4439600"," See if I'm still connected or not."
"4441680","4442420"," Hold on here."
"4444200","4445700"," I still connected to this thing. "
"4448840","4450160"," Looks like it wasn't playing."
"4450760","4451320"," It says it's playing."
"4453180","4454700"," I think it kicked me off for something. "
"4455760","4458100"," I don't even know if I'm still broadcasting right now."
"4459580","4461920"," I did lose internet today."
"4464780","4466000"," I'm going to do a test here. "
"4469000","4469860"," So I am connected."
"4470460","4478270"," We're good to go."
"4483290","4486790"," I'll move some of this stuff around so I can see what you guys are doing here. "
"4493780","4495240"," The $2 million puts on the spy."
"4501150","4501670"," Okay, cool."
"4502050","4502850"," I just want to make sure I'm here. "
"4503750","4512350"," I thought that for a minute there I thought that I lost the signal I had possibly lost the signal"
"4512350","4515350"," on the internet."
"4516550","4521210"," Okay, so we've got some more firming up down below here at 4.30.5. A little bit more support"
"4521210","4527110"," down here at 4.53.57. Negative hero indicator, but not too bad."
"4528390","4532530"," Looks like some of these buyers stepped in below here at 4.53.50 or so. "
"4532650","4533330"," They moved above."
"4534810","4536850"," I'm still going to look for where the smart money is."
"4536850","4541890"," This is where the bank money is down here at 4.30.04. If we can get down here, I"
"4541890","4542590"," will take a trade. "
"4546620","4547060"," Patience."
"4553260","4554620"," You heard the test from the newsfeed?"
"4554820","4555240"," All right, good."
"4555940","4558040"," I think it disconnected me because I minimized it. "
"4564420","4567500"," I minimized it for just a brief moment."
"4569440","4571120"," Sometimes you put something in the background."
"4571540","4572620"," It'll disconnect. "
"4575160","4577920"," It's on a different monitor."
"4578160","4579640"," I brought it up and it's now in the front."
"4580480","4582280"," The side where you guys are commenting. "
"4586270","4587210"," We'll listen to this guy."
"4587290","4591450"," This guy is going to expect this guy to come on between 9.55 or between 10 and 10.30."
"4591910","4597010"," He's going to give an update on OPEC or OPEC."
"4597310","4597650"," Excuse me. "
"4598770","4600770"," I would expect that we see weakness into OPEC."
"4602650","4604770"," Do I hear you rhetoric or bullshit?"
"4605850","4609830"," The ran oil minister has seen the global market needs to increase the time for eating the oil in"

"4620910","4622850"," I've got like me and another guy talking."
"4627080","4627980"," Yeah, whatever Joe."
"4630060","4631700"," I think I just turned it up. "
"4633160","4634840"," I have some more lighting I got to do."
"4634840","4635700"," I got a bunch of new lighting."
"4635860","4638480"," I got a bunch of lighting crap I got to put up that I haven't put up yet. "
"4639380","4640640"," More shit I have to get done."
"4646280","4647820"," I'm going to try to give you a call today Joe."
"4648120","4654360"," I haven't had my phone right here and it's still not charged. "
"4656100","4665600"," I have a daughter who takes my phone and then she wears the battery out and loses the phone."

"4763220","4767960"," He just came in and said the markets are weak right now waiting for OPEC at 10.30, right?"
"4768920","4771080"," Not bad having someone come in there and pop in. "
"4771840","4773320"," Yeah, my daughter might be your daughter."
"4776000","4777460"," I run around here."
"4777660","4779580"," It goes crazy in my house right now. "

"4796700","4800660"," And he's going to be chiming in here every once in a while, especially if I'm taking like a break. "
"4801560","4805500"," From live streaming, you'll have him talking in the background, giving you updates in the market."

"4812040","4814680"," You'll get this news faster than you'll get it on Twitter. "
"4820970","4822670"," And don't trade against it right away."
"4822950","4824850"," Give it like a five days or so or a day or two."
"4825170","4827050"," Get used to what this guy is saying to you. "
"4827490","4833350"," And then just bring up tickers and see the impact that it has on tickers or on the market and"
"4833350","4835330"," see what he's trying to talk to you about."
"4836190","4838190"," It's a nice support building down here, right?"
"4838350","4839470"," Have buyers step right in here."
"4840090","4840570"," 43550. "
"4841550","4842030"," 434."
"4842470","4843650"," 3 as well down below."

"4879550","4880610"," 1, 2."
"4881930","4882630"," Trade higher."
"4892700","4893600"," We should get there. "
"4893740","4896940"," We're going to keep adding to this and making it pimp."
"4897460","4898520"," Promise is going to be beautiful."
"4899800","4903560"," A little resistance forming here at 4.56 on the spy. "
"4917630","4920170"," Might be a nice target for more bounce than a rip higher."
"4920490","4922990"," Looks like we are getting rid of a lot of these sellers above here."
"4923110","4927670"," You can see that we don't have as much ice as we did earlier. "
"4928750","4929570"," Very positive."
"4933190","4934970"," Just this one band of sellers here."
"4936450","4938510"," Just this one band of sellers right here. "
"4939950","4958080"," It would"
"4958080","4958560"," be nice too."
"4958680","4965460"," If we break through this, if we break through this 4.56 or so, we should be doing very well."
"4966840","4968240"," We should start seeing some squeezing. "
"4985910","4987150"," Doing it better, I promise."
"4988650","4991410"," Just keep adding layers and layers and layers to it over time."
"4995350","4996570"," Start doing some interviewing. "
"4997450","4999030"," On slow days, we'll have interview stuff like that."
"4999230","5000590"," Just talk to Tesla Wolf the other day."
"5001470","5006250"," Brian Griffo and talked about doing some trader profiles. "
"5008010","5009010"," And don't want to make it boring."
"5009010","5010550"," We'll be able to bring someone on."
"5010790","5011230"," Just have a chat. "

"5019450","5020890"," What the long and short term goals are."
"5025450","5029410"," I always find a lot of podcasts or people trying to act too smart."
"5030090","5030470"," They're all good. "
"5032230","5036590"," I'd rather want to know who is a person, what are you doing out there with your life."
"5036590","5039510"," I think we're overall all goals, stuff like that."
"5041070","5044490"," You see these bounce around up here trying to destroy some of these sellers here. "
"5044950","5045730"," They're going to overtake sellers."
"5046790","5054270"," Key level here is this 4.56. Break above 4.56 is going to be key for the bulls."
"5054630","5055350"," Take this much higher. "
"5056490","5058610"," I'm going to wait for this break above here right now."
"5059730","5067550"," Another thing to notice too is if the bulls can't break above here at this 4.56, if you do"
"5067550","5070030"," see some rejection here, we are going to end up trading lower."
"5073870","5075690"," I'd even be willing to take it once more. "
"5075810","5078150"," If we get above 4.56, we might be willing to take it along here."
"5078530","5079990"," If not, I'll look for one more bounce below."
"5080850","5082770"," One, two, three, and then a rip higher. "
"5084150","5085470"," Watching some more calls coming to the market."

"5199660","5204300"," Be concerned slightly on what that guy was just saying."
"5204760","5205460"," We have to give him a name."
"5205640","5206300"," You guys come up with a name. "
"5206300","5211380"," I am after Javis saying any sanction on Russia's access to the swift financial transaction system"
"5211380","5214340"," would have spillover effects, comments from IMF."
"5218870","5220950"," Let's take a look at the XLF."
"5221930","5224610"," You guys ready for this one?"
"5225710","5227090"," Google. "

"5260550","5261350"," William."
"5263010","5267930"," We are thinking we are going to be trading with $100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000."
"5267930","5268430"," Please. "
"5269590","5270530"," That ain't ever happening."
"5271710","5272510"," Ever."
"5272510","5272670"," ever. "
"5273270","5281070"," Okay, so they're just talking about financial consequences with the IMF, with sanctions, but"
"5281070","5283010"," they'll be swift on Russia."
"5283130","5286030"," I just also talked about troops being moved."
"5286810","5289790"," You know, I still got these banks down here sitting down here. "
"5289930","5291970"," Still got these sellers sitting above here."
"5292930","5298050"," And you know, you got this doesn't always happen, but it's setups like this, you know, if the smart"
"5298050","5300630"," money is down below it, 453 can't lie."
"5301290","5302330"," That's what the smart money is. "
"5303570","5309630"," Now, that still doesn't mean, you know, that those Google calls are going to impact the market."
"5309790","5311370"," Those Google calls are going to make us trade higher."
"5312270","5313930"," They're just like the spy puts right. "
"5314090","5316930"," They have to hedge against those calls on Google."
"5317610","5321810"," The reality is that we're not going to, you know, you're just not going to see Google trade lower."
"5321990","5323170"," Okay, it's the same Apple effect. "
"5323430","5324430"," It's the same Tesla effect."
"5325350","5329490"," People are going to want Google shares at a hundred bucks, right?"
"5329770","5338890"," So do we trade down to, we trade down to, you know, 2,500 on Google or 2000 is the"
"5338890","5343410"," same that moving from the CDR would impact largely derivatives."
"5349220","5355020"," Yeah, just just to finish up that conversation, when they're moving troops from Germany to I think"
"5355020","5355480"," it's Poland. "
"5356760","5357760"," And I think they said Romania."
"5358420","5361000"," That's like right next door to Ukraine."
"5361880","5362500"," You didn't know. "
"5363280","5367360"," So moving troops to the border is important to show force to Russia."
"5368560","5375820"," Even if we're speaking out of the answer, I'm all saying that we're being, you know, we're"
"5376340","5377320"," negotiating or whatever."
"5383280","5387900"," Snap calls April 14th, 38c, $241,000. "
"5388220","5389320"," Looks like we are trading higher."
"5390440","5396200"," I'm going to assume that that Google trade is going to this, this is dealer hedging on the Google"
"5396200","5396560"," trade."
"5397680","5407250"," Some monster trade, $20 million on Google to bring up the Google chart real quick. "
"5419970","5421690"," We'll see how that's going right now."
"5429480","5443590"," It's like Google load"
"5443590","5443750"," up."
"5451380","5456280"," Note that we do have the oil inventories at 10 30. "
"5456700","5461060"," We have some XOM zone puts coming in currently."
"5461700","5462480"," Maybe some weakness."
"5462860","5469120"," It's it's always recommended not to trade right before this 10 30 hour in oil. "
"5469820","5477080"," And you probably will see some weakness in energy companies and oil as we head into the 10 30 hour"
"5477080","5483640"," XOM February 4th, 79 p for $39,000 is banking on that."
"5484440","5490260"," Also watching SQ puts September 16th, 85 p."
"5491040","5492240"," Speak of the devil."
"5493060","5494820"," Eight hundred thousand dollars. "
"5494820","5495920"," We talked about SQ this morning."
"5496540","5499500"," Eight hundred grand, cool in her grand and there they want to bury SQ."
"5500260","5506180"," Also watching QQQ's puts February 2nd, 369 p for $111,000. "
"5507120","5511360"," So it kind of looks like get some negative flow coming in on the spy still."
"5512140","5515800"," Trying to kind of absorb all these dollars above here."
"5516080","5518320"," I still think we might see some weakness into the 10 30. "
"5518740","5525380"," I'm interested to see if we trade down at 10 30 and then make a nice rip higher for Tata"
"5525380","5526000"," steel."
"5526480","5530280"," Reportedly, the OM is open investigation into Tata steel."
"5538720","5539860"," I'll tell you what though. "
"5539980","5542340"," The chart on spy looks great right now."
"5545050","5546130"," I am."
"5547770","5549890"," I was just looking at the chart right now. "
"5551330","5553230"," I was just looking at."
"5555390","5557470"," See if Tata fell off the roof or not."
"5559090","5560830"," I know is I'm over the counter. "
"5564230","5566150"," I think Tata still isn't over the counter."
"5573880","5577520"," Oh, looks like it was a Tata steel looks."
"5577700","5580320"," Oh, it's no CC and it looks like it was a."
"5581420","5582520"," Looks like it was a."
"5583220","5583620"," I'll did. "
"5584280","5585280"," Good luck with that."
"5597850","5599930"," Looking at spy right now."
"5599990","5600790"," I love the setup. "
"5601610","5611300"," I wonder if it's"
"5611300","5612820"," within seeing this right here."
"5613720","5616940"," Seeing seeing this down here, knowing what's going on at 10 30."
"5617220","5619440"," I'm like, yeah, I'm going to wait till 10 30. "
"5621440","5627040"," I'm going to wait to see if energy and if if something in a line gets weak."
"5633650","5636750"," Seeing puts on the cues just $100,000."
"5637570","5644270"," February 2nd, 369 P Apple puts February 11th, 175 key $300,000. "
"5646150","5647790"," And some other stuff."
"5648050","5656850"," MMM puts 165 P but like $45,000 puts on when small time stuff looks like more like localized"
"5656850","5657870"," weakness currently."
"5660110","5661510"," I'm just let breathe for a minute. "
"5663930","5671540"," So Tata basically owns any of their bulletproof PayPal just filled the gap from 2020."
"5674980","5676700"," Why Google wait till July?"
"5678080","5682640"," Oh, no, the spread doesn't have or the split doesn't happen until June and July at some point."
"5685820","5688960"," So my question is, will it get down to zero?"
"5689120","5690460"," That's how we're going to think about it, right?"
"5690640","5691700"," Everyone's going to think, is it $100?"
"5692800","5693560"," Is it $200?"
"5694600","5695320"," Is it $300?"
"5696400","5697860"," What can I get that stock at?"
"5699040","5700160"," Is it the question you're asking?"
"5700340","5701400"," Maybe any more words, maybe. "
"5704560","5705320"," Red is spread."
"5705580","5706580"," So HP, good job."
"5707220","5710360"," HP is saying that red is spreading on the heat map. "
"5712520","5713040"," Good update."
"5713740","5715100"," HP, thanks for telling us something."
"5730830","5735970"," Yeah, it says Tata.in. We'll say it's the Netherlands branch of Tata. "
"5737750","5742310"," The Netherlands Dutch open bar ministries opens probe into Tata steel."
"5743270","5744290"," I've got on it."
"5748640","5751000"," Let's look to see if the market's weak into 1030. "
"5751320","5752820"," This is a good time not to be trading."
"5763220","5765520"," Where's the market?"
"5765520","5770140"," Yeah, if you guys want to know, if you guys want to know about how I feel right now, I"
"5770140","5772160"," am bearish on the market, currently where we are."
"5772660","5775580"," I'll turn to neutral if we trade above 460. "
"5776820","5780440"," And then if we trade sideways, then up, I'll start to become bullish again."
"5781860","5783700"," So my view right now is still bearish."
"5783780","5785000"," I have a whole video on this this morning. "
"5785880","5789820"," So if you guys want to go back and watch that, this is a good time right now on the"
"5789820","5794100"," market to go back and just watch this morning's beginning of this video, you can scroll back to the"
"5794100","5800880"," beginning and get my viewpoint on my bearishness and my bullishness and discuss it at length this"
"5800880","5801180"," morning."
"5807000","5808340"," Here's some ways to burn options."
"5810280","5811600"," Yeah, just chill out this morning. "
"5812160","5816000"," There's no reason to get crazy or become a hero on either side of the trade this morning."
"5818700","5823220"," Yeah, let's talk about let's go back to the Google conversation because I didn't really discuss"
"5823220","5823920"," that length, right?"
"5825880","5827620"," So am I bearish on Google?"
"5827900","5829820"," No, in no way, shape or form."
"5830840","5842120"," There is some there's some aspect to trading Google or"
"5842120","5845280"," an argument that could be made that the banks it's too expensive. "
"5845360","5846640"," So you can't trade it."
"5847780","5848580"," That's not true."
"5850640","5856240"," There's also a point that the banks could run it up on their own before they get it before you"
"5856240","5857220"," get your hands on it. "
"5858020","5861020"," In June or July, they'll make sure that it's run up."
"5861720","5863700"," Even if you don't participate in that run up."
"5865920","5867000"," This whole thing too. "
"5867480","5871740"," I think I didn't have to do more work on this, but I think the idea is that they're going"
"5871740","5872520"," to replace IBM."
"5873620","5877560"," If I heard correctly, they're going to replace IBM in the Dow."
"5879240","5880800"," That would be the implication. "
"5883760","5884900"," Does anybody know anything about that?"
"5889470","5891130"," I'm going to take these headphones off the kiln me."
"5894290","5896410"," Ah, I can't get a listen to that guy talking."
"5896850","5898510"," I'm going to work on this. "
"5903760","5905620"," Okay, you still have sellers above here."
"5905940","5907520"," So let's talk about what this guy was asking around."
"5907620","5908460"," Okay, so right here, right?"
"5908720","5913320"," Usually when you see these red bars, these are a concentration of sellers above, right?"
"5913960","5919000"," So right where we are, you can see that banks, this right here, is the concentration of buyers down"
"5919000","5919220"," below. "
"5919920","5924180"," We can look even lower than this and see if the buyers are any lower than this area here."
"5924620","5925720"," And you can see right here, right?"
"5926260","5929460"," 453 is generally where support is."
"5929980","5933340"," Now, these buyers have not moved up yet to buy, spy. "
"5933960","5940580"," And that's because it's implied that someone that's smarter than us knows where, knows where real"
"5940580","5941700"," support is, right?"
"5942200","5945940"," Unless some news comes out and those buyers disappear, we start trading lower."
"5946420","5948360"," But these people are just waiting down here."
"5948820","5950340"," They're patient where we're not patient. "
"5951020","5953400"," They're patiently waiting to get their buy in."
"5953640","5956240"," They see us trading down to this 453."
"5956500","5962020"," Sometimes you'll see on this vertical line, you will see this orange bar break and move higher. "
"5962740","5964080"," And that would imply that they're buying."
"5964500","5968980"," You can see light resistance with how this is a yellow line and not a thick red line."
"5969260","5972440"," You see more buyers currently where we are right now. "
"5972440","5973760"," You saw the sell down right here."
"5973760","5976680"," And you want to see, you can see how this line is getting thinner."
"5977180","5980980"," It means that we're sending a supply up of buyers currently on the on the spy. "
"5982460","5984440"," Sometimes you'll get a nice little dip down below."
"5984480","5985580"," We'll slam in a 453."
"5985580","5986680"," You can buy it and run it higher. "
"5987120","5991980"," Sometimes it'll slam down to 453 and then this line will disappear, which means that the support"
"5991980","5992460"," was fake."
"5992940","5995020"," It was spoofing that was taking place."
"5995400","6000980"," But currently right now, there's some smarter money that's trying to grab it down below at 453 and"
"6000980","6001520"," trade it higher. "
"6003760","6005540"," You can see that buy that just took place, right?"
"6005680","6007220"," So that's one, two, and three."
"6008600","6010080"," Normally, this looks like a great buy."
"6010200","6012460"," This would be a place that I would be buying right here. "
"6013220","6015520"," One, two, three, great support."
"6015920","6015980"," Nice."
"6016160","6020420"," We should rip higher here, but I'm going to wait for 10.30. I don't like that we're setting up"
"6020420","6021760"," for 10. "
"6021940","6023560"," It's like 10.19 right now."
"6024140","6025180"," I like 10 minutes left."
"6026300","6027500"," It looks like a trap to me. "
"6037620","6038920"," Yeah, it doesn't matter if they're smarter."
"6039240","6040640"," It matters that they have more money."
"6040800","6041820"," They run the market. "
"6042080","6043160"," They tell us where we're going."
"6044200","6051540"," When I say they're smarter than us, I mean, my implication is more that I always call it the smart"
"6051540","6052680"," money, but it's the bank money."
"6052880","6053840"," Try to trade with the banks. "
"6054640","6056240"," Try to find out where the banks are going."
"6056540","6064800"," Try to try to find out where more important than what retail thinks."
"6065420","6066740"," I think that retail is important. "
"6067720","6068940"," They do impact the market."
"6069040","6071160"," We saw that with the panic selling that took place."
"6071640","6073640"," Retail was involved in that panic selling. "
"6074340","6077480"," So they can have a large impact on the market."
"6077920","6080940"," But generally speaking, other market runs is where the banks want to take."
"6080940","6086260"," The group on GRPN putting out a formal statement responding to the latest negative commentary from"
"6086260","6087100"," Preston's point. "
"6098690","6100370"," Viacom calls coming in right now."
"6100670","6103690"," February 11th, 35c, $22,000."
"6104090","6105710"," Exo well calls coming in right now. "
"6106390","6109390"," February 4th, 51c, $50,000 is going to high algo score."
"6110070","6114510"," AMAT, AMAT, February 18th, 150c for $300,000."
"6114890","6115890"," Another high algo score. "
"6116530","6117250"," I would be cautious though."
"6117390","6119390"," Give the market a little bit of breathing room right here."
"6120190","6122430"," I think the market's going to do a little more dumping. "
"6123750","6125830"," I think it has more to do with OPEC."
"6128290","6133830"," You don't want to see any stupid chick come out with dipshit from Russia."
"6135510","6139870"," Then you don't want to see, you heard Iran saying they want back in. "
"6140970","6143110"," You don't want to see any stupid shit from OPEC leaders."
"6148160","6151840"," If you're having Putin talking to one of those guys in Iran, then it becomes a shit show today."
"6155820","6156840"," More Viacom calls. "
"6158620","6160300"," Everybody's getting in Viacom right now."
"6161060","6164700"," Viacom, February 11th, 34c, $37,000."
"6165400","6167720"," Worth a look at Google. "
"6168140","6169280"," Russia is no vaccine."
"6169560","6176720"," Russia's compliance to OPEC plus the deal is close to 100% that Russia production will increase by"
"6176720","6178060"," 100,000 barrels per day in March."
"6180760","6181520"," That's very positive. "
"6181760","6183280"," IWM just got calls on that news."
"6185360","6189860"," IWM, February 4th, 201c, $447,000."
"6197900","6199660"," So the Google thing, right?"
"6200680","6201440"," So what do they do?"
"6201520","6202780"," Do they run it up themselves?"
"6203300","6207220"," You'll have a news saying, you'll have news out there saying, well, Google's not going to trade"
"6207220","6212060"," higher, and then the banks will take it higher, and then they hit those bags off to you when"
"6212060","6212980"," summertime comes, right?"
"6213180","6217400"," The Viacom is on to say there's a lot of uncertainties, including Amacron spread that remain on the"
"6217400","6218320"," global oil market. "
"6219540","6221640"," We still see lots of uncertainties overall."
"6225270","6227410"," And we'll probably get quiet here and stop talking."
"6228050","6232190"," We're going to listen to the news coming out for the OPEC news at 10.30. There shouldn't be a"
"6232190","6233010"," ton of news today. "
"6233530","6235550"," We're really looking for more news tomorrow."
"6236230","6242430"," We usually have the mafia come out tomorrow and drop bombs."
"6243430","6244490"," Not so much today. "
"6255700","6260520"," I'll wait for that 10.30. Wait for 10.30. Look where we are, and if we're not selling off,"
"6260520","6261600"," I'll probably buy a dip."
"6279460","6286420"," So the news that comes out at 10.30 is, it's not, it's weird, like it doesn't always impact our"
"6286420","6289400"," market, but we have an OPEC, some OPEC news coming out."
"6289920","6294240"," They've been meeting right now, and it's, you know, basically what happens with these meetings is"
"6294240","6297000"," they'll sometimes they'll throw out a bomb, right?"
"6297400","6300460"," Like everything we're going to keep production where we want it. "
"6301640","6304980"," Right now, I think the request is for a hundred million barrel and increase."
"6306560","6309200"," And you'll see, I think it was maybe this 300 million."
"6309320","6310560"," I can't remember, but whatever. "
"6311100","6312400"," And everything seems fine."
"6312740","6317480"," And then out of nowhere, you'll see OPEC say something crazy like, oh, we're going to flood the"
"6317480","6318460"," market with oil right now."
"6319500","6323140"," And it's usually has to do with politics or requests from countries. "
"6323180","6332760"," You have Ukraine right now going on with Putin trying to limit oil and gas into, well, he,"
"6333020","6334160"," normally he limits."
"6334540","6335440"," This is like a consortium."
"6336020","6337440"," It's hard to explain if you're an American. "
"6337840","6338400"," You're an American."
"6339180","6340560"," More from the United States."
"6340600","6344200"," Russia sends a ton of gas into Europe, right?"
"6344620","6350480"," And then the Russian gas is controlled by consortiums within Europe. "
"6352100","6357900"," And so it's this big, it's a, so you've got a mafia, he got an oligarch controlling the flow of"
"6357900","6365200"," gas who's cut it off to Germany, trying to give some pressure to, or political pressure over the"
"6365200","6366280"," Ukraine situation, right?"
"6366760","6371140"," And then you've got the consortiums that do the same thing, right?"
"6371320","6375780"," They try to squeeze Europeans on the back end."
"6376900","6380980"," So they're heating bills or through a freaking roof, right?"
"6381100","6383400"," So you've got like a scam upon a scam upon a scam."
"6383780","6388500"," Now some Europeans are probably in, some Europeans probably inside this feed. "
"6388880","6390680"," I might be packed up in this explanation."
"6393920","6396280"," Thousands, not millions."
"6398500","6406680"," So basically my point is that in these OPEC meetings, you've got this mafia control that plates"
"6406680","6407460"," used for politics. "
"6407560","6409180"," You've got what's going on in Ukraine right now."
"6409280","6410460"," So you never know they could drop a bomb."
"6410840","6412460"," Oil's trading really high right now. "
"6412900","6418000"," So it looks to me like tomorrow oil is going to be a great short, but I don't think it's"
"6418000","6418200"," today."
"6418300","6422120"," I think it's more or less that I think it more or less will matter mostly tomorrow."
"6422400","6426800"," For Javis saying that inflation is higher due to COVID restrictions and climate pressures raising"
"6426800","6427700"," food prices. "
"6432160","6435120"," See this little round of negative news coming into the 1030 hour."
"6443190","6443710"," Winky."
"6445010","6447090"," They will not let spy sell. "
"6451960","6455580"," I think it's the conflation of all this news all at the same time."
"6455800","6457340"," Just lends a little bit of volatility to the market."
"6457800","6459280"," See us trading down right now. "
"6459280","6464180"," The weekly dewy trolling inventory data crude expected plus 1 million barrels, plus 2 million and"
"6464180","6465860"," just minus 1.5 million."
"6469180","6474300"," I understand that yesterday's API data was gasoline to plus 5.8 million barrels."
"6494610","6498730"," George, you have a saying the Fed is the good job communicating its plans to combat inflation. "
"6520940","6521220"," Yep."
"6521340","6522220"," Sellers have disappeared."
"6522680","6524400"," Looks like we've got buyers stepping in here. "
"6530090","6531510"," Good eyes, good eyes."
"6548240","6549360"," Who called that out?"
"6553640","6556420"," Tea with straight green pumping."
"6557800","6560960"," I think I said, was there some tea calls this morning or no?"
"6578460","6579860"," I didn't see what you're talking about. "
"6581040","6587570"," I put it returns to the parents one day."
"6601820","6609340"," 30 seconds to our data crude expected plus 1 million barrels gas and plus 2 million to minus 1.5"
"6609340","6612740"," million utilization expected 87.6 percent."
"6615180","6615700"," Yeah. "
"6615820","6622160"," So, Mero, what's the deal with with gas and oil in Europe?"
"6623640","6625440"," Is it explain it better?"
"6625960","6626800"," I'm hacking jobbing."
"6626940","6627820"," I know the story."
"6628020","6630920"," So, you've got gas being pumped in from Europe, right?"
"6631160","6631840"," What's it kind of?"
"6631980","6636940"," Food at minus 1 million barrels, gasoline plus 2.1 million. "
"6636940","6643260"," This lit minus 2.4 million barrels utilization dropping 1 percent of 4 to 86.7 percent."
"6643640","6648240"," Cushing crude down 1.2 million barrels at 30.5 million total."
"6652980","6657300"," Your target symbol on that news is going to be USO, United States oil. "
"6660640","6665220"," Total domestic production down 100,000 barrels per day at 11.5 million."
"6668660","6672360"," You can also trade BNO, USO and BNO in that news."
"6678400","6679900"," That's natural gas prices, right?"
"6680200","6682260"," I think a little bit higher on these price drawn crude. "
"6683840","6685740"," USO is catching a bid right now, currently boys."
"6690650","6691050"," Yeah."
"6691230","6692370"," So, I think Mero's got it right. "
"6692770","6696290"," So, natural gas gets pumped in here from Putin, right?"
"6696490","6698790"," And he actually doesn't do like, he sets a price."
"6699570","6700770"," He offers it in the future."
"6701010","6701830"," I know that too, right?"
"6701970","6702710"," These are futures prices. "
"6703670","6709330"," And then I know that there's like consortiums in Europe that wind up fucking this all up at some"
"6709330","6709610"," point."
"6713600","6717740"," Are the companies in Europe, are they Russian companies as well?"
"6718000","6723120"," Or are they owned by European companies, Mero?"
"6724720","6728860"," Or are you saying that these companies are Russian as well, so they squeeze them?"
"6746110","6748210"," Yeah, it looks like USO is catching a bid here."
"6754750","6757690"," They were at a high of 63.35 in the overnight. "
"6757690","6761590"," And they did just react to that news."
"6765420","6766520"," We'll see if it continues."

"6842520","6843700"," Look at Rivian afterwards. "
"6844980","6846020"," That was a nice bid on Rivian."
"6846540","6851060"," May 20th, $5.6 million, 100c."
"6864860","6869040"," I think there's no way that Google trades down into June or July. "
"6869880","6876440"," I think that rather than profit taking stuff like that, I think that it trades higher into June,"
"6876880","6876900"," July."
"6892200","6902850"," Maybe the only other thing I would say on it would be after profit taking on Google, that let's say"
"6902850","6910230"," the banks didn't know, let's say the banks didn't know that there was going to be a split, right?"
"6910410","6911730"," So you have profit taking here."
"6912410","6922290"," The snap or half back on Google would be $28.58, between $28.58 and $28.35. I don't know"
"6922290","6928550"," if we trade that low because of the split news, but I would propose that the banks don't want to"
"6928550","6931950"," buy Google at the price that it's at right now. "
"6932050","6938930"," You might see it trade back to $27.54 possible, and then they'll trade it up from there, or they'll"
"6938930","6945050"," tell you that it's not going to run up to $3,000 or $3,500, then they'll trade it there"
"6945050","6946670"," from now into June or July."
"6948610","6950090"," That's possible as well."
"6951610","6953710"," But I think there's no way possible that we're trading. "
"6953710","6960590"," We're going to be splitting Google stock at $120, $130, into June and July."
"6969620","6973580"," It's at $29.13 right now, so we'll see if it finds support here."
"6974920","6977980"," And if not, we're at how deep does it sell down to?"
"6989500","6997080"," We've got a support here at $29.0132. We'll let it lower, see if it does a snapback. "
"6999320","7000540"," We're going to snapback on this."
"7002580","7008640"," First one's at like $28.98, $28.98, that's right there."
"7009820","7016280"," $29.08 first stop, $28.50, and that makes sense. "
"7016720","7024560"," So $20.50 is, this is the snapback for half back, $28.50 next place."
"7024560","7027700"," It's like a nice, nice amount of buyers there."
"7034460","7043480"," Here's where the big boys are down here, right at $2,800. "
"7051730","7054390"," They get a trade back, I'd say it trades back to $20."
"7056970","7061550"," I don't think it trades this low, like $27.60 down in that."
"7062270","7065810"," But that is big support, $27.60 is big support, be aware of it. "
"7066870","7069930"," $20.50, be looking for a stop there."
"7072450","7080420"," At the worst, we'll get Rivian next."
"7093240","7102420"," Looks like we got close to $4.53"
"7102420","7103760"," on spy. "
"7109900","7119980"," Watching Tesla calls win for $1 million, or excuse me, puts $9.20 P, QQQ puts $09,000, XP"
"7119980","7121260"," puts, this is a weird one."
"7123240","7125000"," I'm not even going to talk about that one."
"7125440","7134420"," AFRM though, talked about that one this morning, AFRM February 18th, 80C, $410,000. "
"7146270","7151230"," Had that beautiful bounce on the spy down below, I think it tagged $4.53, 42."
"7153750","7162340"," Nice supply down there, if you can squeeze it up and take a look."
"7163920","7166820"," A nice little bounce right down here, gorgeous grab. "
"7168120","7170420"," Right back here, we're looking at Google and that happened."
"7171460","7172720"," It's a nice buy down here."
"7180480","7181720"," Smash and Ambassion. "
"7184160","7191260"," XLB puts X-ray Lima Bravo, February 11th, 85, P, $59,000."
"7191800","7194200"," What's going on, Rivian?"
"7194840","7196160"," Rivian looks like it's getting train wrecked."
"7199960","7206780"," Pretty decent support here, $66, $34, $65, $60. "
"7207780","7209840"," Why is it still selling them down like that?"
"7214920","7215920"," Sucks for Rivian."
"7218140","7228470"," Someone just bought those calls that like get by in heaven or is that see"
"7228470","7229410"," why they're buying there."
"7230030","7232550"," You know, be careful on Rivian on those calls. "
"7234690","7241170"," The time frame is, well, you know we've had support of 50 bucks."
"7243750","7245950"," That's a tough one down there."
"7249720","7253620"," You know what I would do is I would keep your eyes on those calls that came in on Rivian"
"7253620","7254100"," for May. "
"7256140","7257800"," Just like keep your eyes on them."
"7258460","7262220"," And then what you do is you look for Rivian to trade lower down to 50."
"7263100","7268820"," And if they stay in those calls, even down here at 50, then maybe enter them. "
"7270160","7274960"," Enter the same calls down to 50 bucks, only if there's still interest down here at this 50."
"7275340","7276280"," Maybe they know something."
"7278160","7281580"," So that's a lot of money on those Rivian calls. "
"7286160","7290940"," You know, it's not always like buying them when they buy them is what happens is with these golden"
"7290940","7299580"," tickets is they sometimes have the reposition themselves and they can move their money around and"
"7299580","7301460"," have more money than you and I have, right?"
"7303640","7310500"," So sometimes the intent of those calls isn't so much to make money off them, but to stabilize help"
"7310500","7316260"," stabilize the stock might be someone with a lot with a huge position inequities that are really"
"7316260","7317560"," trying to make money on those calls."
"7318160","7325260"," Be careful on that on that trade on Rivian."
"7327100","7330580"," It might just be being used to hold prop up the stock. "
"7332300","7341130"," The same supply down here, 453, 453, 47."
"7341990","7346630"," Sometimes they'll sneak upright, 453, 20, 40, 30, somewhere in here."
"7347550","7348510"," We'll see if this holds. "
"7353390","7354950"," Not a hell of a lot going on today."
"7363210","7364150"," He's ain't the moves."
"7372180","7373340"," Whack a ruler spy. "
"7381480","7383120"," Yeah, Mira, what are you doing today, brother?"
"7383440","7384760"," Are you taking a trade or what?"
"7385240","7386700"," What's your trade today, Mira?"
"7388400","7390760"," Most reliable sell still is XBI."
"7391700","7392160"," Terrible."
"7393060","7394600"," You're thinking about taking a hood short?"
"7395920","7397880"," Shit, I haven't even looked at it the past few days. "
"7397900","7398600"," I'll be honest with you."
"7398660","7400100"," I've been so focused on the freaking spy."
"7401060","7402160"," I haven't even paid attention. "
"7402980","7404640"," Damn, I don't have to 15 bucks."
"7405580","7407280"," Pretty good damn good for hood."
"7407480","7409260"," I saw that nice ripper on hood too. "
"7409920","7410420"," Can't lie."
"7410620","7413500"," When it got down to $9.77, I bought that shit."
"7414320","7417080"," I sold out long before that, uh, 15 bucks though. "
"7418100","7419540"," But I did snag it that morning."
"7420040","7426420"," It was like 9.77, like 4 a.m. I was like, Bullshit, ain't going any lower."
"7427640","7430080"," I was like, there's no way it gets down to like 10 bucks then. "
"7430260","7434320"," I was thinking, someone, I think it was market to man, was like, I wanted it $6 or $7."
"7434880","7436320"," I mean, there ain't no freaking way."
"7436860","7437600"," Not this time around. "
"7437820","7442220"," They can trade down to probably six or seven bucks, but not the first time it hits 10."
"7442720","7443760"," That pitch is going horrible."
"7443920","7444460"," I shouldn't say that. "
"7444700","7444960"," I shouldn't swear."
"7445540","7446240"," It's going back up."
"7450060","7452000"," Spy looks like it wants to make a move higher here. "
"7456100","7457180"," Spy is fighting."
"7459360","7460340"," Oh yeah, 80."
"7460720","7461360"," There it goes. "
"7462760","7467980"," Looking like it wants to tag higher at 4.56. Spy looking beefy right now."
"7469020","7469460"," Jacked."
"7470240","7471240"," Let's see if we can break through. "
"7471960","7474580"," It's nice to see the supply of sellers even higher now."
"7474840","7478780"," They're scared to move in higher at 4.56.50. So we can break through."
"7484480","7487600"," If Kramer said buy hood, sell it away right now. "
"7488020","7488720"," Just sell it."
"7489360","7490220"," Are you serious?"
"7491600","7495880"," That Kramer said buy hood last night after a, what is it, a 50% run?"
"7497780","7500700"," Do not buy hood right now."
"7501880","7503800"," Yeah, we could talk about some earnings plays. "
"7505180","7506180"," Let's talk about Amazon."
"7506600","7507520"," Let's talk about Facebook."
"7508300","7512560"," I like, uh, Facebook's today, right?"
"7512860","7514160"," It's their day Wednesday or Thursday. "
"7518320","7519540"," So we got going on today."
"7519980","7521600"," Now we got Facebook earnings today, right?"
"7521900","7522420"," Today or tomorrow?"
"7523740","7525900"," Oh yeah, we got Metababy on Wednesday."
"7526940","7528520"," We got Qualcomm today. "
"7529700","7530420"," We got Spotify."
"7532100","7538600"," And then tomorrow after the bell, we got a bunch of energy companies."
"7539420","7540380"," Lipstick company. "
"7542940","7543820"," Penn National."
"7546920","7548600"," I'm interested in Penn National."
"7551060","7554420"," Someone was saying that they think one of these companies is going to go bankrupt. "
"7558190","7559190"," Oh yeah, look at that."
"7559330","7561070"," Penn National is just looking to get started."
"7561850","7562590"," Just look at it. "
"7565250","7567450"," Penn National is just begging to get started."
"7570590","7571590"," That all time high."
"7571810","7572410"," Oh no, it's not. "
"7572770","7573930"," I've already been shorted the hell down."
"7574610","7575510"," Worth nothing now."
"7576290","7577030"," 48 bucks. "
"7581010","7582170"," It's ripping right now."
"7583970","7585550"," Maybe it's not looking to get shorted."
"7586030","7587290"," So was that, was that done?"
"7588110","7589810"," Was that 1.50 at one point?"
"7593750","7595390"," UNG and it's an energy play. "
"7597410","7597890"," UNG."
"7599290","7602630"," March 4th, 21C, $97,000."
"7605550","7609130"," Someone was saying that one of these, one of these, someone was saying, I don't know who we're"
"7609130","7614390"," asking any SN in Switzerland so to be closing in on a deal for protein powder maker, Oregon. "
"7616370","7617990"," There's a house as soon as this week."
"7621820","7625480"," One of these like smart guys are saying that one of these, one of these gaming companies is going"
"7625480","7626120"," to declare bankruptcy."
"7628380","7629880"," I'm going to get shorted in the ground. "
"7631000","7631760"," I picked Penn."
"7632440","7634960"," I think it's Penn."
"7639810","7641450"," Looks like a double bottom on Rivian. "
"7645890","7647410"," Nice little ripper there on spy."
"7647650","7648990"," This looks like every day's action, right?"
"7649870","7651610"," Trade down, bounce off."
"7651850","7654470"," Right now it looks like we're bouncing off 4.53, 54. "
"7656590","7659350"," Almost a clean strike there for the chart that I put on Twitter."
"7662030","7668370"," We had a couple more bounces down below and then we're trading it up to 4.56, 44 or so."
"7669310","7676110"," And on a daily simple moving average, like a 200, the 100 and the 50 and whatever. "
"7676910","7677570"," Just trading in there."
"7677770","7683210"," Now it's just finding resistance on the daily SMA right in the one-minute chart."
"7683370","7685210"," You'll just see where you just keep bouncing right off it. "
"7694980","7697140"," Penn's been taking since last earnings in the Davey drama."
"7698460","7699940"," Yeah, Davey drama was kind of bullshit."
"7705360","7707080"," You guys want to check out for you?"
"7712360","7717360"," Some error saying that is the ex leading to pull down spy with it. "
"7717460","7721240"," There are a lot of QQQ puts out there right now too."
"7722600","7723120"," Pulled down."
"7729850","7730990"," Yeah, win by program. "
"7738090","7740590"," Yeah, it kept the runs making a very good point right now."
"7741130","7744130"," Santa wants to remind her whether the VIX is approaching sub 20 this week."
"7744130","7745590"," Hatching is reaching a good discount. "
"7746290","7747330"," Always something to consider."
"7747790","7749390"," No one ever over hedges when it's cheapest."
"7750150","7750890"," 100% agree. "
"7753030","7764040"," The red bar just vanished to 4.55. Yeah, Capran"
"7764040","7765140"," making a good point."
"7765780","7767460"," Anything sub 20 right now and the VIX is good."
"7770060","7772240"," If we rug pull this shit, this is where it happens. "
"7772240","7773380"," You guys all know that, right?"
"7774000","7777880"," If there's a if there's a if there's an F in rug pull, this is the perfect place."
"7778380","7780600"," Like straight red bars to hit the depths of hell."
"7784660","7786680"," The perfect place for it to happen. "
"7790100","7790820"," Oh, yeah."
"7791140","7791560"," Winky baby."
"7791620","7793200"," I knew you were talking about Qcom. "
"7793740","7795420"," Your boys are important today, right?"
"7795820","7796160"," Pretty guys."
"7796320","7797440"," I'm going to do I just did Rivey."
"7797500","7798400"," What do you guys want to do for?"
"7798940","7800700"," We'll do some of these some of these. "
"7801940","7802840"," We'll do Qcom."
"7803620","7804680"," Do some of these ER plays."
"7804860","7805240"," We'll do Facebook. "
"7807260","7808560"," Can't stand Facebook."
"7808780","7809500"," I hate trading them."
"7812000","7813200"," Can't stand the zuck. "
"7813880","7823280"," VIX is up 2% in the day currently."
"7823620","7824740"," Yeah, I haven't been paying attention to VIX."
"7824840","7825520"," I probably should. "
"7826840","7829700"," There's no reason not to pay attention to VIX today."
"7830780","7832040"," Kind of criminal not doing it."
"7834420","7836560"," Looks like we slapped that support. "
"7836740","7838720"," Yeah, so we talked about it."
"7838720","7839820"," Just a little bit below it."
"7839960","7840440"," 2142. "
"7840820","7841920"," Climbed all day long today."
"7842500","7843600"," We did just reject off."
"7844720","7846140"," A 208 simple though. "
"7848060","7849420"," Um, the one minute chart."
"7863860","7864820"," VIX is dropping."
"7866480","7869220"," You guys don't want to see VIX get pounded into the dirt. "
"7870180","7873160"," You want to see VIX at 13 or 10 with real cheap."
"7877180","7878900"," This is the same old shit with Qcom."
"7879360","7880640"," Day traders paradise here. "
"7884760","7885780"," Got a dip sell the rip."
"7887500","7888840"," Buy the dip on Qcom 180."
"7890380","7891360"," Sell it up to 188. "
"7891760","7892060"," 73."
"7893100","7893700"," Rinse and repeat."
"7896720","7898940"," It's a great one by the way of trading Qcom. "
"7900320","7901040"," It's pretty basic."
"7901500","7903060"," It doesn't get him any more basic than this."
"7904580","7906100"," Then they rug pull it every once in a while. "
"7906200","7910180"," If you make too much money, you just like trade it for 100% of your money and then you"
"7910180","7912440"," trade it for like 80% of your money than 60% of your money."
"7913000","7915320"," And 40% then 30% until you pull the rug on your ass."
"7916260","7918060"," Trade it back down to 170% or whatever. "
"7921560","7923480"," Ooh, watching some hood calls come in."
"7935550","7937550"," Watching hood calls come in right now."
"7939030","7940650"," Just right in the face of it, right?"
"7941110","7944010"," February 18th, 15c, $53,000. "
"7945590","7948130"," IWM calls Qcom puts right now."
"7948650","7952450"," That February 4th, 175p, $273,000."
"7952810","7955390"," I don't know if Qcom's already traded up to that 190 mark yet. "
"7956530","7957690"," Let's get in close, right?"
"7958330","7958610"," It's at 185."
"7960250","7962010"," It's close to this 190 level."
"7962210","7963050"," Trade it down to 175. "
"7963910","7964990"," Up, down, up, down, back and forth."
"7971980","7972860"," Look at the hood next."
"7973720","7974620"," See if hood goes up. "
"7976060","7977800"," IWM calls coming in right now."
"7981780","7982740"," Snap calls."
"7983780","7987940"," Google 318-3250C for $136,000. "
"7988420","7990120"," Snap calls coming in right now."
"7990320","7993800"," February 18th, 32C for $600,000."
"7994900","7996020"," That's two sweeps. "
"7998920","7999800"," Look at hood."
"8000260","8001920"," I'm not finding anything that I want to buy yet."
"8002220","8005140"," Let me honest with you guys, all this looks like fluff to me. "
"8005140","8007640"," This is none of this looks like a market moving day."
"8010180","8011980"," So sorry for the beeping in the background."
"8013160","8017700"," I just think that's coming from a book map for some reason. "
"8022020","8023800"," Let's buy coming back down here, rejection."
"8029040","8030680"," This is the same old bullshit with spy."
"8032080","8034740"," Pick it up at 45, 45, 46. "
"8035040","8036100"," Pick it up at 45, 46, 46."
"8037860","8045800"," I would not be buying hood calls right now at $15."
"8046220","8046840"," That's Encino. "
"8048540","8053860"," Train range currently on hood is definitely $10, 970."
"8054900","8058120"," And if you're going to run it up 50%, wait for the dip."
"8058960","8060060"," There it is right there, OK?"
"8060700","8065860"," Ten bucks, $10.25. Maybe we get to 17, 16, 75. "
"8066200","8066680"," I'll give you that."
"8067580","8067960"," But I wouldn't."
"8068040","8069320"," This is Diddle in the middle, right?"
"8069580","8070300"," You want to buy it at 10?"
"8071120","8073720"," And then start thinking about selling out at 50%. "
"8075000","8076380"," This is like straight Didlin."
"8077720","8079200"," And maybe it does trade to 17."
"8080260","8082360"," But Jim Kramer should have told you to buy at 4am. "
"8083400","8085240"," He goes last Friday when they had bad earnings."
"8085960","8087460"," The other day that was Thursday or Friday."
"8088460","8092960"," He should have come on CNBC and did a special mad money at like 4am and said, buy right now. "
"8093820","8095420"," Not at $14, $15."
"8104600","8105780"," Yeah, let me take a look and see."
"8105940","8106880"," It says it's still here. "
"8107060","8107900"," He hasn't talked at all."
"8108640","8109560"," Alfredo hasn't come on."
"8109740","8111120"," Just hasn't come on before. "
"8111340","8111960"," There's no new say."
"8112300","8117780"," That's one more thing to talk about is that video is frozen."
"8119040","8120700"," You guys see me waving right now, Joshua?"
"8121880","8123520"," Or sometimes it's on your end. "
"8124060","8125280"," You guys see me waving my hand?"
"8126700","8127360"," Yeah, hood."
"8127620","8128780"," I don't like that trade right now."
"8128860","8130480"," There's not a lot of trades I'm liking right now. "
"8131280","8132560"," Just as it heads up, OK?"
"8133800","8136120"," Like you make sure you take good trades every time."
"8136820","8139200"," And you just saw some Q-com puts come in."
"8139360","8141460"," And now I just see Q-com calls come in. "
"8142120","8144440"," 185 seats February 4th."
"8144920","8147980"," A bunch of day traders fighting each other, slap fighting on Q-com."
"8148640","8150060"," We'll look at Facebook next. "
"8152200","8153980"," I'm not seeing a lot of market direction."
"8154800","8156780"," What do we talk about in this channel all the time though, right?"
"8158440","8159300"," That's gotta be."
"8160400","8161420"," What is that beeping?"
"8164750","8166130"," Find out what the fuck that is. "
"8168210","8170050"," Is it a Windows security alert or something?"
"8171090","8176690"," OK, so when the market trades like this right now, right, the VIX is still dropping right now."
"8178330","8185420"," As we're trading higher, you've got your sellers up here."
"8185740","8187880"," Get your buyers down below 453. "
"8187920","8195180"," Get your sellers above between 45499 and 45645 here."
"8195660","8197260"," Right up, down, up, down until you pick a direction."
"8206410","8208809"," So I'm not seeing a direction right now in the market. "
"8209549","8210610"," We know the VIX is low."
"8210930","8214469"," We know we got one bounce on the VIX yesterday at 2142."
"8215629","8219870"," Looks like if we get another bounce right here, you start tapping around, right?"
"8220110","8222650"," One, two, three, just it's usual, right?"
"8222930","8226610"," Well, it's one, two, and then you end up seeing a repire on the VIX. "
"8229910","8232030"," And we talk about this channel all the time."
"8232030","8237950"," If we start trading sideways for longer than a day, if we trade sideways for one day, not so bad,"
"8238129","8238150"," right?"
"8238309","8240990"," We can make a move by end of day in either direction."
"8241629","8247830"," If we start trading sideways like one, two days, three days, typically, not always, but you get"
"8247830","8251110"," like 65-75% of the time, we trade down. "
"8252030","8253170"," We start looking for lower prices."
"8253510","8254750"," We don't want to see that today as well."
"8255270","8256250"," We want to see that trade higher. "
"8257450","8258469"," We want to see us trade up to 460."
"8259090","8260750"," We want to get bullish, make a decision."
"8262170","8264770"," We traded this high as it is, right?"
"8265570","8268790"," So if we're going to trade this high, we might as well take that look above and see if we're"
"8268790","8269809"," going to get rejected or not. "
"8271430","8274770"," So at least for the day, we went leaning bullish."
"8275969","8279350"," If we traded this high, right, we might as well take the look above."
"8279889","8290719"," There's no reason for us to trade here and then just automatically reject, at"
"8290719","8291680"," least take the look above. "
"8292860","8297879"," And if we don't take the look above, well, we know that futures placed us here, right?"
"8298639","8302820"," So if we don't find, if we don't look above today, it ain't going to be pretty."
"8307260","8307860"," I'm frozen."
"8308959","8311000"," God, oh, sorry, I won't swear. "
"8311379","8311639"," Be quiet."
"8314540","8315639"," All right, so I'm frozen."
"8318680","8319379"," We're painting the ass. "
"8323330","8325850"," Look at me like goofy head, pulled my hair back in a bun today."
"8325850","8327690"," I got a freaking man bun."
"8333209","8334690"," My hair in a man bun today. "
"8335309","8336709"," You know what I'll do is let my hair flow."
"8338270","8341889"," You guys can't see my hair flow, so I'll just start flowing it left and right."
"8342570","8344709"," I'm going to do my knot and just start whipping it. "
"8345950","8347090"," My hair was soaking wet."
"8347270","8351209"," My kids were, so there's my kids taking showers more and right."
"8351990","8353110"," Now the shower, I'm going to make breakfast. "
"8353530","8354389"," Then I got to talk to them."
"8355090","8355850"," Can't brush my hair."
"8355969","8356370"," Can't. "
"8357510","8359790"," Can't brush my ankle hair."
"8362790","8369260"," You said I listened to Kramer when he was on a radio like 18 years ago."
"8369340","8371080"," I forgot to see him and see now he's acting more crazy. "
"8371420","8373059"," I'm almost like, dude, Larry Cuddle is crazy."
"8373860","8374600"," He's a crazy man."
"8375120","8376860"," You know he's got some dead bodies in the closet. "
"8384639","8385840"," Let's see if I can reset it."
"8387640","8388460"," It's kind of weird."
"8388660","8392760"," Not hearing anything from no news at all. "
"8394200","8394880"," Haven't seen nothing."
"8396120","8396920"," Let's test this."
"8397960","8398400"," Message. "
"8398840","8401520"," Your sound card and network configuration are working properly."
"8402900","8404940"," All right, it says I'm good to go on this."
"8406460","8407460"," Let me see if I can. "
"8407760","8413240"," Around the top of the yard, some Russian deed on industrial production for December expected 4.5%."
"8420330","8421730"," Let's say he's getting back on there."
"8421790","8422510"," He's talking to us."
"8429580","8434400"," Russian industrial production, 6.1% above the 4.5% expected for December. "
"8436480","8438540"," You're saying this is something wrong with Kramer?"
"8438780","8440040"," I'm saying this with concern for him."
"8440620","8441820"," He's an old junkie."
"8442000","8443020"," He's an old cokehead. "
"8448920","8453920"," Denmark 49ers Earth 530.7 billion versus 529.8 prior."
"8455480","8465370"," I keep an eye on the Dixie right now on those two"
"8465370","8465610"," reports."

"8479670","8482970"," $184,000 also calls on Qcom. "
"8483770","8485250"," February 11th, 200c."
"8485550","8488670"," It does look like there's more calls than puts on Qcom at this point."
"8488670","8492510"," They might try to just pin Qcom at some point today. "
"8493230","8500150"," You'll notice as we get into earnings reports that we get a bunch of bets coming in."
"8501770","8505090"," And they will pin it intentionally no matter what comes in."
"8505670","8506890"," Warning at this point. "
"8507190","8515330"," Warning, warning, Tesla, multiple puts coming in for millions of dollars."
"8515330","8520430"," One, two, three, four, five, six, almost six million dollars in puts."

"8551830","8554310"," Significant put flow on Tesla at the moment."
"8554950","8555690"," We'll look them up."
"8555810","8556910"," We'll look at Facebook real quick. "
"8557150","8560390"," And then we're going to check out how ugly things are getting on Tesla."
"8570400","8572440"," Facebook's like it's about to shit itself right now."
"8573060","8575020"," Y'all want to be careful out there in this market. "
"8577960","8579740"," It's not good to see here."
"8579740","8583600"," Do you see what's going on here with Facebook?"
"8585680","8586780"," It's not a good look."
"8588160","8589420"," More sellers than buyers. "
"8590580","8591840"," Slightly higher call flow."
"8592300","8594900"," Just waiting to pull the rug though into clothes on Facebook."
"8596680","8599580"," Be very cautious here in the market. "
"8602600","8604160"," We're going to take a quick look at Tesla."
"8615740","8619440"," Why are we seeing that ugly of color of put flow on Tesla?"
"8623450","8625850"," Let me scare the market wide right now."
"8626350","8628410"," There could be a rug pull going on. "
"8658420","8661980"," I'm not trying to joke about, uh, I'm not trying to joke about."
"8666660","8673100"," So he talked about two impacts of that put flow."
"8673340","8675100"," First of all, the dealers are going to hedge it, right?"
"8675620","8677360"," So it's going to make Tesla weak right here. "
"8678520","8681780"," If you can break below 900, you're going to create some panic selling."
"8683420","8684720"," So we're going to watch that right now."
"8684880","8686280"," See if there's any panic selling in Tesla. "
"8688040","8691120"," As far as Kramer goes, you know, Kramer's an old school."
"8691660","8693940"," There's not, I call him a crack head, but he's not a crack head."
"8694060","8697360"," But you guys got to understand these guys, guys like Kramer, right?"
"8698160","8702080"," You hang out with guys like this, man, these guys, they live a hard life. "
"8702480","8707000"," Like on the surface, you have a home life of the wife and kids and all that kind of stuff."
"8708240","8711340"," When you know, I've known some of the, I've known guys like him, right?"
"8712060","8713440"," And, you know, they live a hard life."
"8713740","8715040"," It's a hard life that they live. "
"8717200","8720640"," And, you know, you get older and you're just like, you don't care anymore."
"8721740","8723800"," Um, he's talked about retiring."
"8724400","8725880"," He's had those more hit a moment recently. "
"8726100","8726860"," We talked about retiring."
"8728900","8734200"," But all the partying, like eat so many steaks every day or drinking whiskey or, you know, do they"
"8734200","8735060"," do some bad stuff?"
"8735220","8739340"," These guys, you know, you think, you know, but you don't, until you really see it, then it's every"
"8739340","8739640"," day."
"8740380","8743800"," It's every day, day in, day out for 40, 50 years. "
"8743800","8748080"," And it takes a toll on people is that's hard living."
"8749220","8753380"," And, you know, publicly you wouldn't believe that that really does happen."
"8753560","8754880"," It really, really does happen. "
"8755860","8759560"," Like the whole bottles and models thing is real and it gets uglier as people get older."
"8761760","8765440"," Not him, but a lot of guys like him, you know, they end up getting to be like 40, 50"
"8765440","8766680"," years old, 60 years old."
"8767240","8770240"," At that point, they're like through like wife number one, wife number two. "
"8770900","8775140"," You know, the, the, or the wife's just, you know, you know, they're separated even if they're"
"8775140","8775640"," living together."
"8779910","8784550"," And, you know, like they're a shovel themselves."
"8786890","8788010"," It's a long, hard life. "
"8789150","8790230"," And it's mostly the partying."
"8790810","8792690"," Like if there's a part of it, that's the big part."
"8793270","8798810"," Here's the stress and the job, but like the, the partying that goes on, the lifestyle, telling me"
"8798810","8800390"," go out and eat steaks every single night. "
"8801330","8802430"," It wears on the heart."
"8806230","8808250"," Well, I watching dip buyers come in on Tesla."
"8809670","8815230"," February 11th, 1000 call C, $200,000 and $237,000, respectively. "
"8817370","8822690"," Some spy dip buyers, February 4th, 457 C."
"8823350","8824950"," You see it a lot with like a salesman."
"8825870","8827170"," You see it in the salesman communities."
"8827550","8828410"," They travel all the time. "
"8829230","8829830"," They're never home."
"8830710","8833290"," And, you know, they live hard, hard lives."
"8842800","8843800"," Yeah, it's the cocaine. "
"8844080","8844580"," It's the hard living."
"8845220","8846140"," You know, you can't trust."
"8846140","8852040"," I like that he's gotten people started trading, but I'll tell you what, I don't know if you"
"8852040","8853140"," remember 2007. "
"8857350","8859190"," Up to people lost everything."
"8860830","8867250"," When you lose everything, like when you've built up a life and you've got this CNBC just constantly"
"8867250","8868930"," saying bye, bye, bye, bye."
"8870110","8872350"," Sorry, my marker was right right then in there. "
"8873470","8874690"," I don't watch it anymore."
"8875010","8876750"," I can't watch any CNBC anymore."
"8876750","8877810"," I can't trust it. "
"8881860","8883340"," People got straight wrecked."
"8888020","8890420"," You're listening to Trade the News."
"8890440","8891480"," Trade the news, baby. "
"8893500","8897980"," 908, we'll add a now down here."
"8904810","8908310"," Yeah, I don't like where, I don't like where Tesla is right now."
"8908450","8909970"," I don't like where Facebook is right now. "
"8912680","8914120"," I don't like the bottoming pattern."
"8914400","8916320"," The VIX right now."
"8926080","8928240"," I don't like the put flow in Tesla right now. "
"8941600","8942780"," Look and see."
"8948100","8949880"," There's a lot of money on Tesla puts."
"8951500","8952800"," They're dated for Friday. "
"8959080","8963060"," Next move below would be, I don't think they're fighting for 10 bucks."
"8966060","8969380"," 850 for Friday."
"8978600","8981300"," Yeah, options, options action on Friday. "
"8981300","8985320"," Some of the shows on the show are on CNBC are pretty good."
"8993120","8994980"," CNBC could be a great channel too."
"8995400","8998080"," I mean, everyone's like, oh, we'll just Fox Business News. "
"8998980","9000720"," None of them really do that good of a job."
"9001200","9002780"," They could do such a better job."
"9003700","9009120"," If you had some real legit, like legit traders, professional traders on that, professional"
"9009120","9012400"," investors, not like pop paid bullshit. "
"9013800","9016380"," Everyone's selling something on CNBC right from who they interviewed."
"9016380","9016960"," It doesn't matter."
"9017300","9018180"," It's going to happen. "
"9019000","9025140"," But if you're able to hire some independent people that just do a show, do shows, it'd be so, so"
"9025140","9025440"," rad."
"9030720","9031660"," Like they have the potential."
"9032100","9032700"," I'll give them that. "
"9035160","9039500"," And then when I watch shows on off the, I have tried to tune in the shows that are on"
"9039500","9040080"," YouTube and shit."
"9040800","9043880"," I always feel like, I always feel like I'm with a bunch of used car sales ones."
"9044340","9048040"," I always feel like half the shit that you see on YouTube, I believe it's a live stream. "
"9048680","9052200"," It's always like two, three guys and they're fucking pumping all morning long."
"9052400","9054780"," They're all taking Adderall."
"9056760","9058840"," You know, they're all on some form of infatamine. "
"9061000","9062820"," So I'm like, I can't trade with those guys."
"9063160","9070340"," Can't listen to these guys in the morning at 9 a.m. I'm not an Adderall at 9.30 in"
"9070340","9070900"," the morning anymore."
"9081460","9083180"," Yeah, did Nasdaq just get whacked?"
"9083240","9084160"," It's looking like it's ready. "
"9084160","9087400"," I mean, you say Facebook's on the edge."
"9087400","9090580"," We'll look at, we'll look at Apple next."
"9092060","9095580"," And everybody's sitting on some kind of like spare support. "
"9096740","9097980"," So we'll still look at Apple."
"9098320","9099800"," Look at all that's the usual suspects."
"9100680","9102900"," Haven't been seen a whole hell of a lot of Apple for today. "
"9103720","9105260"," So we'll take a look at Apple and see what it's doing."
"9105480","9106580"," Facebook's not looking pretty."
"9107540","9108780"," Look at Amazon after that. "
"9124220","9125640"," Yeah, they're all setting up."
"9125780","9127360"," You can see them setting up right now."
"9128800","9130740"," Facebook's setting up for a dump. "
"9132940","9133860"," It's getting close."
"9135140","9137480"," Joe Donah wants to take a debit put spread here."
"9137840","9138980"," I've been adding them at every level. "
"9139200","9141060"," I'm in a whole bunch of shit right now."
"9141140","9144040"," So I've got the debit put spreads sitting here."
"9144760","9145640"," I bought them. "
"9145780","9148880"," I think they're 425, 420s, but I bought them right at 451."
"9149760","9152540"," They're dated for February 18th, I think."
"9152540","9156740"," And then I've got some 442, 440s. "
"9158100","9161500"," So I'm sitting on a load like a whole truckload of puts right now."
"9161740","9167960"," Just if anybody didn't know that, even though I've been trading spy calls, right?"
"9169640","9170820"," All the way up, right?"
"9171080","9172940"," Always key moments in trading spy calls."
"9173800","9175460"," Now I've just got a bunch of free puts. "
"9176900","9180520"," I made some money, but I'm like up plus I've got free puts."
"9180520","9184640"," So I'll just keep trading this up to an all-time highs if I need to."
"9185420","9190980"," But along the way, I'm buying protection in case we sell, because we're in a pair of stance until"
"9190980","9191480"," we trade higher. "
"9192020","9192720"," Till we get over 460."
"9195700","9197020"," I've got Condemon."
"9200880","9202920"," Let's take a look at, oh, Desperado. "
"9203160","9204200"," Thank you for the tip this morning."
"9204880","9205360"," Appreciate it."
"9206600","9207300"," Yields to the moon. "
"9207500","9208120"," Thank you for the tip."
"9210000","9211060"," Mohan, thanks for subscribing."
"9211340","9213220"," I appreciate the subscribes and likes just as much. "
"9213680","9215220"," Thank God for my brother."
"9216020","9218500"," Thank you for the tip."
"9219020","9222960"," Pablo says I don't even trade, but I keep you on in the office all day because I like listening"
"9222960","9223700"," to what's going on. "
"9224180","9227440"," People walking in and see book map on the TV and ask what the F is this."
"9228040","9228820"," I try and explain."
"9229280","9233020"," Yeah, we're going to try to add some more content to the show so you guys can keep this on"
"9233020","9233700"," and keep it a little bit. "
"9233800","9234960"," I won't be swearing as much."
"9235960","9237000"," There won't be the soap opera."
"9238880","9244020"," But we're going to try to get it so that we have enough content for everybody that they can keep"
"9244020","9245620"," tuning in throughout the course of a day. "
"9246280","9249700"," We can switch it up, put some guests on."
"9249940","9251680"," We'll have different topics to talk about."
"9253520","9254700"," Keep you guys all interested. "
"9255020","9256160"," You can talk to each other in the chat."
"9257300","9258020"," Thanks, Pablo."
"9258860","9260200"," I appreciate the support, brother. "
"9263040","9269000"," Without a doubt, we can talk about anything that's, you know, talked about Ukraine this morning."
"9269160","9270220"," Talk about Google this morning."
"9271340","9272460"," Talk about oil this morning. "
"9273140","9274160"," Talking about some earnings."
"9274800","9275900"," Let's look at Apple real quick."
"9276120","9278820"," See, let's see if it's ready to sell off some of these. "
"9279060","9280540"," If we look at Apple, come on, man."
"9280740","9281180"," Look at Apple."
"9281720","9283120"," What are you doing, Smalls?"
"9284820","9286020"," Look at Apple. "
"9286640","9287780"," It's all setting up here."
"9288920","9289380"," Look at this."
"9289500","9290180"," Again, a rug pull. "
"9291140","9291600"," This is insane."
"9292000","9293260"," Look at this sitting here in support."
"9293960","9295280"," Apple's about to start falling. "
"9296100","9297060"," It's getting all droopy."
"9298120","9299300"," Start looking under the hood."
"9302710","9303550"," It's killing me. "
"9307830","9308610"," What are you doing, Apple?"
"9309730","9310170"," Seriously."
"9310570","9311170"," Look at you, buddy."
"9313950","9315310"," Not seeing a lot of calls there. "
"9315590","9315950"," Puts an Apple."
"9316110","9317210"," It's just slowly fading."
"9317890","9319490"," You don't want to ever see this right here. "
"9320210","9321330"," It's not good for Apple."
"9322070","9324250"," You want to see, like, hard red support here."
"9325130","9326090"," Price target in Apple 170. "
"9328350","9329050"," Hands down."
"9329810","9331610"," Can't be up here doing this goofy shit."
"9332930","9333970"," Look at this. "
"9334890","9336270"," Apple's just kind of fucking around."
"9337970","9338990"," No man's land."
"9340250","9341570"," Wall of sellers above. "
"9343070","9345450"," No flow at all coming in on Apple."
"9346830","9347750"," Oh, here we go."
"9347930","9348430"," Here's the ugly. "
"9350490","9354330"," You've got spy puts coming in February 2nd, 455p."
"9355350","9356290"," $140,000."
"9357830","9358570"," Tesla puts. "
"9359650","9360590"," What did Tesla do?"
"9361510","9364670"," I thought, like, the battery stuff was all figured out this morning, like 4am."
"9364870","9365990"," I heard some good battery news."
"9367330","9369350"," Good battery demand or some Tesla. "
"9369850","9371850"," February 4th, 900p."
"9372430","9373570"," $2.5 million."
"9374330","9376350"," Tesla, another one. "
"9377330","9378670"," February 4th, 900p."
"9379030","9380050"," $2.1 million."
"9381170","9381850"," That's a total now. "
"9382150","9384050"," I mean, Tesla's racking it up right now, okay?"
"9385330","9387970"," We'll take a look at Tesla put flow right now."
"9388130","9390510"," I'm going to assume that's pretty ugly."
"9390970","9394990"," Yeah, I got Tesla put flow 11 puts for $11.5 million. "
"9394990","9395210"," $11."
"9400590","9401490"," No bueno."
"9403070","9405370"," No bueno on Tesla right now. "
"9407030","9408570"," Apple's just kind of hanging out there."
"9408690","9411970"," Facebook's on an edge looking suspect."
"9416640","9418560"," Spy bouncing off that 453. "
"9419200","9421620"," That just ricocheting down here, 453 currently."
"9426440","9428460"," Vix has a resting bitch face right now."
"9431840","9433160"," Just looks like it was to get nasty. "
"9436940","9437660"," Oh shit."
"9444470","9445190"," Getting saucy."
"9448360","9451780"," Yeah, we got the EU close coming up right here. "
"9452740","9454240"," Just sell it down a little bit."
"9454360","9455100"," Let me just get out of it."
"9455100","9457140"," Let me just un-aff myself out of my put spreads. "
"9458180","9459220"," Just sell it down."
"9459420","9460560"," That way I can win both sides."
"9466840","9467860"," Just sell it down. "
"9468300","9469940"," I promise I get out of my put spreads."
"9469940","9473800"," And I promise I'm going to short the market again."
"9477480","9478760"," Look at that rejection. "
"9480980","9481380"," Rejection."
"9482100","9482500"," Buyers."
"9483220","9484440"," Old man, Mr. Bank, right?"
"9484680","9485720"," Old greedy white man hands. "
"9486620","9486680"," Right?"
"9486840","9488380"," That creepy old guy with the greasy hands."
"9488900","9490760"," Down here trying to buy the dip at 453."
"9490880","9491780"," He's been waiting on more than long. "
"9499580","9501340"," Yeah, just a quick rip below, you know."
"9501700","9502700"," Just cool it off a little bit."
"9503120","9504320"," Nice little dip to buy. "
"9505460","9506700"," Keep this truck rolling."
"9510280","9512060"," Just keep this truck rolling along."
"9512380","9513840"," Meanwhile, we're just going to bounce around. "
"9525490","9527870"," Oh yeah, Joe Harper, step it up."
"9529310","9530670"," And Joe Harper leaving a tip."
"9532310","9535450"," You make some money, Joe Harper, on the spiked by trade yesterday. "
"9535510","9536070"," It's a pretty good trade."
"9537250","9537630"," Not going to lie."
"9539970","9542510"," What is the right time to load up on puts or calls?"
"9542970","9545670"," Yeah, greasy white man hands like that old white guy. "
"9547270","9552250"," They try to walk by those greasy old like those old old white rich guys just walk by and just"
"9552250","9552410"," want."
"9552530","9553310"," I don't want all their money."
"9553770","9555130"," Just want a little bit of their money. "
"9556530","9557990"," These are the guys that have billions."
"9558870","9560190"," Just want to slip it out of their hands."
"9560650","9561210"," Not all of it. "
"9563570","9564710"," That's how I look at the market."
"9565190","9567070"," I look at the market like a bunch of old white guys."
"9567790","9569050"," We're in Nantucket Red. "
"9570230","9570630"," Right?"
"9570750","9572490"," They're like the guy from the catty shack, right?"
"9573290","9577270"," So well, what I forget his name is right now, but I don't want all of his money."
"9578130","9581010"," He won't even notice that it took some of his money."
"9584810","9585210"," Yeah. "
"9591290","9592090"," I'm bearish."
"9592170","9592850"," I mean, I'll be honest with you."
"9592910","9594870"," I'm still bearish here until we trade higher. "
"9596470","9598170"," This is like the classic setup."
"9598550","9604420"," This is where I'm in 460 though, man."
"9604560","9605860"," I am full on bullish. "
"9608180","9610300"," I don't know if bears are pissed off about it."
"9611120","9612640"," I hear bear bull saying that."
"9613200","9614500"," That bears are pissed off. "
"9616680","9617420"," I don't know."
"9618800","9622140"," Bears made a shit ton of money on the way down to 420."
"9623040","9625060"," They made a shit ton of money on the way down to 420. "
"9627220","9628220"," Oh, shit ton."
"9632070","9634390"," I don't think we need to go revisit it."
"9634490","9640470"," I think we're gonna, but I think if we don't revisit it now, I think we revisit it between now"
"9640470","9641790"," and March or June. "
"9641790","9643270"," I don't think I don't care when it happens."
"9644010","9646590"," I think we revisit it this year."
"9647250","9648110"," I think we revisit it. "
"9652010","9656530"," We usually do like 80% of the time we do."
"9658950","9660690"," How do we revisit it right now?"
"9661130","9661590"," No."
"9661990","9669030"," If this is a rejection point, if we don't reject here, let's say we trade all time high as we"
"9669030","9670310"," trade like power bowl. "
"9672330","9676090"," We still have to think about profit taking off a burning season."
"9678550","9687940"," Typically in February and March, you see the weakest part."
"9688900","9694640"," Like the summer buying, like while they do it in springtime buying, is usually in January and"
"9694640","9695420"," February and March. "
"9697140","9699700"," So they're probably not done doing their buying yet."
"9702300","9704160"," Not every year, but a lot of years."
"9708780","9710760"," So it wouldn't surprise me to see us come back down. "
"9710760","9712160"," That's not even being bearish."
"9712260","9713900"," I think that's just normal market action."
"9718530","9721010"," We do have some shit this year too. "
"9721250","9723070"," I mean, there are some problems with this year."
"9724390","9726390"," It is an election year."
"9726690","9728510"," That's not a presidential election year. "
"9728590","9732650"," We typically don't have better years when we have the Senate."
"9738250","9744830"," Although specifically this year, being off an election year, it's going to be an interesting Senate"
"9744830","9750790"," race this year due to where we are with the economy."
"9752490","9759850"," You're looking for either a mandate that we're going to spend a lot of money in tax, a lot of"
"9759850","9760050"," people. "
"9760930","9762690"," Or you're going to get a rejection of that."
"9763330","9768150"," And I think to an extent, I'm not trying to, I don't want to get political here unless this"
"9768150","9769430"," involves the stock market."
"9770630","9779370"," But I do think there was some kind of a referendum on not wanting Trump in office and not caring"
"9779370","9780630"," who the candidate would be. "
"9783090","9788410"," And then where the taxation is and how it impacts the economy and the market, it wouldn't surprise"
"9788410","9791490"," me to see the Senate flip to Republican."
"9792990","9794890"," That's typically how it is, right?"
"9795010","9797310"," We have a Republican president, we have a Democratic Senate."
"9800490","9802530"," Wall Street likes that a lot. "
"9803890","9810370"," Wall Street tends to like if there's a Republican president, believe it or not, actually like a"
"9810370","9811130"," Democratic Senate."
"9811610","9813230"," They like gridlock."
"9813550","9817610"," A lot of people don't realize that that Wall Street likes gridlock in Washington. "
"9818470","9822710"," The less that Washington can do, the more the market is known."
"9825580","9829580"," So you'll see Wall Street will want that in the background."
"9830000","9832420"," Even if you don't see that, that's what Wall Street will want. "
"9832920","9836540"," They don't care if the president's Democrat, Republican, they just want it split."
"9837040","9838500"," They want opposing views."
"9839560","9843660"," They want less change so that they can work within that country. "
"9843660","9849060"," I think some call activity, the February $9 calls are active at 70 cents."
"9849340","9851200"," Here's taking a little bit higher on volume."
"9851460","9852300"," Michael golf India. "
"9854360","9855000"," MGI."
"9855000","9855780"," Do you see that?"
"9856300","9856700"," Call activity."
"9857040","9857380"," MGI. "
"9858920","9860460"," Take a bring that up on your."
"9863380","9864460"," That's money Graham."
"9866960","9868260"," Unusual call flow. "
"9868580","9868940"," MGI."
"9869720","9871180"," Michael golf India."
"9880590","9881910"," They call it balance. "
"9882510","9882910"," Yeah."
"9885090","9888050"," It's like one of the only things that it's one of the only things that."
"9888170","9889150"," Yeah, I'll show Tesla here. "
"9890230","9894810"," It's one of the only things that stock market is hates or Wall Street hates is unknown news."
"9895430","9897770"," Like they hate it with a passion."
"9898270","9899490"," They don't care if it's good news. "
"9899650","9900630"," They don't care if it's bad news."
"9901130","9903070"," They like to control the market."
"9903590","9906110"," The more the market can be controlled, the more money they make. "
"9906410","9908230"," The more that they know, the more money they can make."
"9908730","9911650"," The more unknown news that they don't know about."
"9913650","9919800"," The more unknown news that the more news that they don't know about, right?"
"9920240","9922000"," They have to be like us, right?"
"9922560","9926200"," They want to know more than us as the retail trader and how we get caught in trades. "
"9926200","9928800"," We don't know where we're going and we end up losing some money."
"9929200","9934380"," The banks hate losing money and they usually only lose money when there's unknown news."
"9934840","9935720"," So they like stability. "
"9948240","9952420"," Johnny five step in and letting us know that money Graham had some buyout news a week ago."
"9952780","9954600"," A week or two ago."
"9955040","9956400"," You know, they might buy some call. "
"9956580","9957320"," Oh, money Graham."
"9957920","9958360"," Whoo."
"9959480","9961860"," With a huge spike on money Graham. "
"9964740","9966340"," Huge spike on money Graham."

"13898400","13898960"," I love you, Emerson."
"13899740","13901340"," Okay, so let's talk to the new guy here."
"13902000","13902960"," Brett, how are you?"
"13903200","13904320"," So what are we doing here, brother?"
"13905460","13913480"," We have Brett, we've got a, I think Brian, Brian Watts just pissed off. "
"13913880","13914460"," I get it."
"13917420","13918800"," So what are we doing in here?"
"13920780","13925020"," Brett is, this is a free subscription."
"13927880","13934100"," I started out by buying all the stuff right by all the, like by all the flow programs, you buy"
"13934100","13937080"," all the classes, you buy all the descriptions. "
"13942820","13946880"," And I felt like I was getting taken for a ride and then I'd go into like discords and people"
"13946880","13948160"," would be assholes."
"13955560","13962820"," Yeah, my, my Twitter account, my original Twitter account had a lot of, I was doing a daily briefs"
"13962820","13964520"," every day, like typing them out."
"13965300","13969000"," And I did some videos and then we started doing some live streams. "
"13972040","13973300"," I didn't see the Epic Grant."
"13973460","13974760"," I didn't see the Epic Grant, Stephen."
"13977760","13981300"," I saw one Epic Grant recently, but it wasn't when that happened. "
"13984140","13989360"," Yeah, so then I made a private, a private YouTube or Twitter account and then I found that I was"
"13989360","13993340"," being followed again by the same kind of people, whatever people selling information, whatever."
"13993560","13994760"," So we were just rolling out."
"13994900","13995740"," I was like, you know what?"
"13995880","14001480"," I know people pay like 600,000 bucks a month, spend money everywhere on subscriptions and they"
"14001480","14003280"," spend thousands of dollars everywhere else. "
"14003280","14004760"," So I was like, well, we'll do a free sub."
"14005920","14009800"," We'll roll this up and we'll, we'll do a, a free sub."
"14009800","14013400"," So we trade with volume profile. "
"14014060","14019320"," We trade with classic traditional charting strategies, add a lot together."
"14020600","14024040"," We add in gamma and volatility levels."
"14025400","14027540"," And then we add all that to a thing called book map. "
"14028800","14032020"," We added a little sprinkle of the news, right, a new squawk."
"14032380","14035720"," And then we have a community of traders that try to help each other out to make money."
"14037960","14043720"," We have in the description, you'll see links to the discord, the Twitter handle website. "
"14045560","14046320"," We got a quarter of our traders."
"14048920","14051440"," We always like likes and subscribes if you're a new trader."
"14052280","14056560"," If you're making money or learning how to trade better, please donate to help keep this channel"
"14056560","14056960"," alive. "
"14057240","14058300"," It does cost a lot of money and time."
"14060120","14060860"," Let's stick around."
"14061360","14065140"," Introduce yourself some people, get it, get inside the discord or meet people. "
"14071620","14073480"," Positive traders, positive, positive investors."
"14082210","14083770"," So is the ranch still out there?"
"14086970","14087630"," Thanks to."
"14092660","14097020"," Is the, is the ranch still out there from, um, from Brian, what is it?"
"14097260","14098900"," I thought he deleted his channel in all his videos. "
"14099760","14100860"," I heard one rant."
"14101040","14105940"," The one rant, I ended up turning it off mostly because I didn't want to get influenced by it."
"14106700","14111920"," And I remember it was like the first five minutes I listened to, but I don't think it was when"
"14111920","14115140"," he got really, really pissed off and shut his shit down. "
"14135940","14136820"," Yeah, we've been trading."
"14139440","14139880"," Yeah."
"14140820","14142300"," I mean, Brian's got a good point, right?"
"14142640","14145940"," So, you know, even if let's say Brian got pissed off, right?"
"14146260","14152060"," The problem I think was this is that you've got, uh, Brian's, Brian's making calls every single"
"14152060","14152600"," day, right?"
"14154020","14156480"," Brian's making calls every single day, Brian trades every single day. "
"14157140","14159240"," Brian trades year round."
"14159800","14165120"," You know, if Brian says something like, if Brian says something like, you know, the market's not"
"14165120","14166880"," going to sell off during earning season, right?"
"14167180","14167640"," And it does."
"14168120","14173920"," That doesn't mean that Brian doesn't, uh, uh, take the short side or adjust to the market selling"
"14173920","14174540"," off either. "
"14174960","14176580"," And so that's the real problem, right?"
"14176580","14180340"," Is that you guys are out there, not you specifically the people that are listening right now, but"
"14180340","14181580"," you guys have to understand that."
"14182840","14186880"," Well, these people are out there trading every day, investing every day, selling the market every"
"14186880","14187120"," day."
"14188360","14192720"," Most of these guys that have been trading for a long time can adjust in a moment. "
"14192920","14194620"," They're not bulls or bears in truthfulness."
"14195180","14199480"," And even if we sell the market or buy the market, the adjustment is quick."
"14200340","14203140"," Uh, so you guys have to understand that that takes place in the background. "
"14204860","14205640"," This isn't everybody."
"14205660","14207800"," Like some guys are just out there selling shit, right?"
"14208240","14212840"," I don't believe that all these guys are traders because I don't think that they're, um, I don't"
"14212840","14219380"," think they have the time to trade and produce like heavy, like polished, polished, polished"
"14219380","14220560"," information all the time."
"14221000","14222360"," So I don't think everybody's out there trading. "
"14222480","14223640"," They might be buying stocks and stuff."
"14224180","14227360"," We look at like a guy like Brian and there's other traders like him out there."
"14227760","14230580"," Uh, it doesn't matter if they get it wrong. "
"14231060","14234360"," And there's a few things with that and caveats with that."
"14234700","14235660"," Uh, I want to interrupt real quick."
"14235800","14240260"," We've got some calls coming in on Tesla February 4th, 900 C, $625,000. "
"14240520","14245000"," The key though with Brian is he can adjust his trading strategy, right?"
"14245600","14249620"," And so when he goes on a rant and says, well, the market's not going to solve during ER season"
"14249620","14251440"," and then it does sell off during ER season."
"14251920","14256020"," And the problem is you've got people making fun of them on, on social media, right?"
"14257060","14264140"," Now, number one, the people that are making fun of them on social media don't have, uh, you like,"
"14264320","14269040"," like a leg on them where they're going to go out there and tell you these aren't the people that"
"14269040","14270240"," are telling you what they're trading."
"14270800","14274200"," These aren't the people that are, these are the people that scream that it's going up or going down"
"14274200","14274680"," all the time. "
"14274760","14276320"," It doesn't matter if it goes up or goes down, right?"
"14276780","14281300"," But these people that don't actively trade the market, take a stand, give you a position of what"
"14281300","14282600"," they're, well, how they feel about the market."
"14282600","14285420"," You guys are always like, hey, you think we're going up, we think we're going down."
"14286500","14287700"," And you have to make a call. "
"14287860","14291220"," If you get it wrong, all of a sudden you're like, you got it wrong and you're, you're bad."
"14292560","14300960"," But in reality, but in reality, you have, uh, traders like him that can adjust to it selling off"
"14300960","14301320"," anyways."
"14301560","14301740"," Okay. "
"14302400","14307900"," Uh, and they're not just, it's the other word part is that you've got people that are making fun of"
"14307900","14308000"," them."
"14308060","14310040"," I know I saw everyone making fun of them on Twitter."
"14310760","14314760"," And the worst part is that they're making fun of them because they're watching them every day. "
"14314780","14317300"," The guy does a show and he's got 20,000 watchers."
"14317700","14318580"," Those are hedge funds."
"14318880","14320480"," Those are movers and shakers. "
"14320640","14321800"," Those are big traders and investors."
"14322560","14326640"," And so you got one guy that's out there saying the market's going to crash all the time, 24 hours"
"14326640","14327480"," a day, seven days a week."
"14328140","14330280"," And he's also watching Brian Watt every day. "
"14330800","14333900"," Because he's watching Brian Watt because he wants to trade with Brian Watt every day."
"14335000","14337560"," Because he knows that Brian Watt is a better trader than he is."
"14337560","14338360"," Yeah. "
"14338720","14340580"," So, you know, it's insulting to Brian."
"14340740","14341200"," It's not cool."
"14341960","14343320"," Uh, it's not cool. "
"14343840","14347760"," Uh, but I'm sure people have lost out with not being able to trade with Brian."
"14350060","14355620"," Same stuff going on here with, uh, the spy still 4 56 68."
"14356980","14358460"," 4 53 12. "
"14358940","14364040"," So, you know, book the Brian Watt thing is like, um, you know, you put yourself out there every"
"14364040","14364180"," day."
"14364480","14365680"," A lot of people don't do that, right?"
"14365680","14366920"," And so you give them that respect."
"14367100","14369980"," If you don't like what Brian Watt is saying, you don't have to tune into him. "
"14370300","14373560"," Brian Watt's kind of guy that, you know, if you don't like what he has to say, just don't tune"
"14373560","14373760"," in."
"14374440","14376500"," You know, but the trolling of Brian Watt, I didn't like."
"14377220","14377580"," I was upset. "
"14377920","14379580"," I went on a Twitter rant about that."
"14379760","14381400"," Like, just don't, you don't go after him."
"14382080","14383480"," He's not the guy to go after. "
"14384080","14385080"," You want to go after somebody?"
"14386200","14389240"," How about like, uh, you know who they are, right?"
"14389580","14390720"," You know who those guys are."
"14390860","14391640"," You know who the pumpers are."
"14392740","14393780"," You know how they are on Twitter. "
"14393780","14395680"," You know who they are on YouTube."
"14397240","14400760"," You know the people that are, you know the people like the, uh, who's the other goofy guy with the"
"14400760","14401020"," glasses?"
"14402100","14405040"," Uh, where they're selling, you know, like, it's like $600,000 classes."
"14405320","14406500"," They sell like $800. "
"14407060","14407520"," Talk to you alone."
"14407760","14408280"," They just tip charge."
"14408340","14409160"," All kinds of nonsense. "
"14410320","14412120"," Uh, for all kinds of shit."
"14412640","14414260"," Hundreds, thousands, thousands of dollars."
"14416630","14417690"," So, I don't know. "
"14418210","14419490"," This is still concerning right here."
"14419590","14423490"," See all these sellers still stepping in over here at 4 56 50 47."
"14423990","14425750"," See these sellers showing up out of nowhere. "
"14427070","14428150"," Still a concern here."
"14430390","14431350"," We can break above this."
"14431370","14432290"," I'll take this long here. "
"14433330","14434510"," Still watching the sellers."
"14435150","14437330"," Still trying to wear out sellers currently on the spy."
"14438110","14439470"," Up to 4 55 74. "
"14440210","14441350"," See if we can break through here."
"14443490","14445170"," Yeah, Zach Moore, Zach Morris."
"14446230","14447130"," Yeah, Cardinal Cash. "
"14454300","14455600"," Yeah, the odds are in his favor."
"14456460","14457740"," Without a doubt, Emerson."
"14457740","14460080"," And even if he's wrong, he can switch in a moment. "
"14462770","14464450"," You know, I'll trust Brian Watt, though."
"14464650","14467630"," I'll trust Brian Watt over most of Twitter."
"14471580","14472620"," Yeah, who's the other guy?"
"14472780","14473360"," The Stewie guy?"
"14473440","14474380"," I got into some trouble or something. "
"14476240","14481600"," So, like, you know, like, it's, uh, it's not easy being a trader."
"14483080","14484440"," It's not easy being an investor."
"14486360","14490220"," And you're making your best educated guess as to where the market's going. "
"14490220","14492680"," And you're going to get them wrong."
"14492960","14496040"," That's the other weird part is people are like, well, I'm a matter of fact, matter of fact,"
"14496100","14500600"," yesterday, last night I was asked in a comment, are you still bearish on this market?"
"14501140","14503260"," And it was still a headscratcher for me."
"14503800","14509180"," I said to explain myself this morning, my position on being bearish and bullish and why I'm there"
"14509180","14514220"," with that, uh, uh, with that thesis right now. "
"14514520","14516220"," And that thesis still holds true."
"14516220","14520760"," And as a matter of fact, if you don't have that thesis for how you trade the market, eventually you"
"14520760","14522660"," are going to blow up your account and never come back to trade again."
"14523020","14523980"," I know that for a fact. "
"14524660","14526560"," Those fundamentals have never left the market."
"14526840","14527520"," They held true."
"14527960","14532460"," You couldn't be above the last two years in 2020 and 2021 on spy. "
"14533140","14538960"," If you didn't say use those same principles that we are applying to the market today, right?"
"14539700","14542220"," Uh, be more BA calls coming in right now."
"14542220","14544640"," It's going to be February 11th, 220 C."
"14547260","14550200"," $28,000 and $27,000."
"14550340","14550780"," A couple more sweeps. "
"14551180","14551960"," That's like four now."
"14552780","14553880"," The last half an hour on PA."
"14554940","14555940"," Positive for the market. "
"14556840","14559520"," Watching more Tesla calls February 4th."
"14559620","14560300"," That's the second set."
"14560880","14561480"," 905 C."
"14561740","14563140"," $744,000. "
"14563720","14565160"," People are getting bullish right now."
"14567260","14568920"," So that's the, uh, that's the idea behind."
"14568920","14573020"," Uh, Brian, why don't you guys always pray, praise that guy?"
"14573240","14575260"," Guy puts his balls out there every single day. "
"14576080","14580300"," And whether he's right or wrong to have that information to bounce off that guy with you."
"14580840","14585040"," Like, dude, sometimes when I'm trading, I can't tell you how many times when I trade alone, I'm"
"14585040","14585320"," paranoid."
"14586000","14586980"," Like I have nobody to talk to. "
"14587660","14591660"," Like having you guys inside the chats to bounce ideas off of is huge for me."
"14592080","14595900"," It means so much to have you guys to be like, what do you guys think of this trade?"
"14596060","14597680"," You guys like this trade hate this trade or whatever."
"14598420","14602480"," Watching calls coming in on SQ markets getting kind of bullish right now. "
"14602480","14603200"," SQ calls."
"14603760","14608420"," Uh, February 4th, 115 C, $216,000."
"14608640","14612700"," Spy calls February 2nd, 4th, before C, $154,000. "
"14613400","14619720"," More BA calls coming in two more sets of 220 for February 11th, 28, $27,000."
"14620420","14623520"," And we've got some more spy calls February 4th, 4, 4, 60 C."
"14624760","14625760"," $415,000."
"14625760","14627220"," I'm going to try to break through this right now. "
"14627780","14632000"," There is an attempt to break through this resistance in these sellers here."
"14632560","14636820"," The hero indicator is still bearish, but it's gone down."
"14636880","14639120"," It was at minus 50,000 at one point. "
"14639540","14641580"," That's down to minus 40,000."
"14641800","14644340"," Still more sellers than buyers on the spy right now, currently."
"14645620","14646700"," Calls now in SC. "
"14646920","14652220"," We had negative calls this morning, but now we've got some positive calls on SE coming in February"
"14652220","14656100"," 18th, 155 C for $368,000."
"14658160","14664200"," So when you're, you know, when you're like, uh, yeah, I remember the, I remember the cancer X-ray"
"14664200","14664640"," videos."
"14667160","14668480"," MGI is moving on up. "
"14669620","14674800"," So the, you know, like the thing is like Brian Watts is just helps as a, as a trader."
"14675840","14683300"," Um, as an investor, as someone who watch and listen to, he's another tool for your toolcase."
"14683300","14685420"," We are coming in some resistance currently. "
"14685700","14689040"," Be careful here at an, an Nvidia 24976."
"14689600","14691520"," A little bit of sellers just hiding above here."
"14692020","14697700"," If you do break through 259, well, basically the buy that dip is down here at 245, maybe lower. "
"14697880","14699120"," We can, we can look for them."
"14702640","14707840"," We want a above price target on the small little level right here."
"14707840","14710560"," Next target, I was 255, 257. "
"14712400","14713700"," Where are the real sellers at?"
"14714100","14717440"," Real sellers are at 260 on Nvidia."
"14719950","14721530"," We'll add in a hero indicator."
"14721950","14723170"," See if it's bullish. "
"14724930","14726750"," Yeah, why would you, why would you want him to leave?"
"14727830","14728610"," It's kind of funny."
"14728750","14729930"," You go, that's people making fun of them, right?"
"14730170","14731030"," Now, now he's gone."
"14731590","14733910"," So now you can't even bounce off your theories against them. "
"14735550","14737710"," Kind of crazy, which kind of pisses me off."
"14737710","14745530"," That guy's written more, like, do the guy's written more, um, scripts for Thinkorswim than 95% of"
"14745530","14750530"," traders on, on Twitter or anywhere else, any other social media."
"14751010","14751790"," Guy's a gangster. "
"14753010","14754650"," 240, 245."
"14759580","14762200"," Call it buy the dip of 245."
"14764260","14766000"," See if we can break through on Nvidia real quick. "
"14766860","14770060"," Here indicator is slightly, slightly negative."
"14770880","14772580"," More buyers than sellers on Nvidia."
"14772980","14773500"," Looking bullish. "
"14776340","14777340"," Price target 260."
"14778280","14780280"," You can break through 240, 250."
"14786900","14788120"," His Rancos shots are amazing. "
"14792410","14798030"," Did Brian, you can't, like, there's nothing about Brian what I can say negative about him."
"14800200","14802460"," He has a baller, period, and a story."
"14804600","14806260"," And the guy's fighting cancer right now. "
"14807520","14812220"," I can think of, like, I can think of a hundred other people that are worth trashing than Brian"
"14812220","14812540"," Watts."
"14815680","14816320"," A hundred."
"14817080","14818280"," A hundred other people easily. "
"14820960","14824700"," I mean, just think about the cancer that's like, what is that stock twits?"
"14827570","14828610"," Not all of stock twits."
"14828830","14830430"," There's a few small, really bad ass."
"14830570","14831510"," I don't know why they're on there. "
"14831510","14835110"," There's a few bad asses on stock twits, too, believe it or not."
"14836430","14837890"," But that place is a shit show."
"14838350","14839510"," You're making fun of Brian Watt?"
"14840230","14841430"," Get the fuck out of here. "
"14844050","14846490"," Snow, February 4th, 280C."
"14848210","14848790"," Couple sweeps."
"14850410","14852710"," Yeah, kind of a high-ago score in the 280s. "
"14853290","14853970"," Like, not really good."
"14854730","14855430"," Another snow though."
"14855650","14857190"," I think it's got three, four snows now. "
"14857450","14857530"," Okay."

"14908890","14911270"," Just back in the phone was the worst customer."
"14915400","14917020"," Yeah, I used..."
"14920080","14921040"," I lost..."
"14921040","14921980"," It was really weird."
"14922220","14927300"," Like, I got a letter in the mail or something that my identity was and who I was or something"
"14927300","14928420"," was putting a question. "
"14928660","14930020"," They shut my account down and take a swim."
"14931200","14932560"," So then I..."
"14933600","14935480"," Then I wound up getting..."
"14935480","14938120"," Having done that, I didn't read the letter or something."
"14940180","14942560"," I didn't read the letter, so they shut my account down. "
"14942840","14944580"," Then I went to go bring my account back up."
"14945580","14947200"," Lots of spy calls coming in."
"14947520","14948920"," QQQ's calls coming in right now. "
"14950660","14953280"," I'm trying to bash the resistance right now in the spy."
"14953880","14956860"," Bulls are in charge and large right now."
"14957620","14961280"," Still waiting for this break above at 457.10 or so. "
"14961280","14965180"," I've seen reports of private equity losses in the month of January."
"14965680","14968860"," Late street capital management reported they lost about 15%."
"14968860","14973280"," Tiger global management hedge fund was down almost 15% as well. "
"14973600","14976740"," And whale rock capital down nearly 16%."
"14978220","14981780"," Yeah, baby long-only hedge funds got wrapped up in that sell-off."
"14984160","14985200"," Got wrecked. "
"14992500","14993660"," Get wrecked."
"15008980","15023310"," I want"
"15023310","15025750"," you to remember that spy is still at its resistance."
"15026110","15027630"," It is not broken resistance yet. "
"15027770","15029710"," You can still see the bands above here."
"15033310","15039930"," And it is just a ricochet off where its resistance was at the open at 939."
"15040550","15046210"," Remember we talked about we're trading in this zone right here. "
"15046330","15050270"," You want to pick this up long only after we break above these sellers here."
"15051070","15052710"," You want to wait until we break."
"15053050","15054270"," This is all ice right here. "
"15054350","15056710"," Still have sellers on the spy."
"15057110","15058830"," Still have day traders, right?"
"15059010","15064230"," Boiler rooms are going to trade this up and down in this range until big money steps in."
"15064430","15068330"," You always talk about waiting until we get above this to take this long here. "
"15068330","15073770"," If you're going to trade within you buy the dips out of 453, trade them up to 46 or so."
"15074590","15075630"," Get out of them."
"15075950","15078170"," And then you wait for the trade higher. "
"15091290","15092290"," Getting wrecked."
"15096250","15098390"," Now we're talking about hedge funds getting wrecked."
"15103060","15105960"," You can still see this, right?"
"15106060","15107460"," These are these major sellers in here. "
"15108020","15109360"," Don't have 456, right?"
"15109480","15110520"," They're trying to resist this."
"15110720","15112520"," If we break above this area here, right?"
"15113460","15115640"," You see these sellers still coming in here."
"15116660","15118480"," You see the buy zone is down here. "
"15118700","15121140"," 4323, 24, you trade it up to this 456."
"15121660","15126660"," You get out and then you wait for the move higher to take it long to 460."
"15127780","15131700"," Otherwise, you're taking your profit and running and you're going to wait until we jump above. "
"15132780","15136120"," If there's rejection here, you're going to look to take a short down to 453."
"15143830","15148550"," One other note would be that the, you see this bearish to bullish liquor."
"15148790","15152350"," And this was up around 52 minus 52 earlier. "
"15152730","15154290"," It is slowly losing."
"15156610","15159910"," We're at the 1252, almost the one o'clock hour."
"15160450","15164950"," Sometime around 2 o'clock, we should see if there's an MOC buyer sell side into the end of the"
"15164950","15165190"," day. "
"15167510","15169810"," I am overall bullish this market right now."
"15170170","15174790"," Still have lots of calls coming in on TQQQ, $400,000 on March 18th."
"15175070","15178150"," It's every 1.5C. I do want to let you know that we are up here. "
"15178270","15180990"," We traded up here from 420, right?"
"15181210","15186050"," So when we trade up here from 420, when we get this high in the market, even if this is"
"15186050","15190270"," where a huge rejection can come in and we can burn it all the way down to a low number."
"15190530","15195850"," For Snappas and AP mentioned by Najarian on CPC on unusual options, activities here in Event Ralph"
"15195850","15196190"," and Papa."
"15197430","15200090"," Snap has unusual call activity on it right now. "
"15200630","15201770"," Bring up a snap chart."
"15205110","15206870"," We'll go back to that conversation in just a moment."
"15208790","15210550"," I just keep an eye on Snap real quick. "
"15210890","15213350"," Unusual options activity alerted by trading the news."
"15214830","15215350"," What's his name?"
"15215510","15216090"," What are we calling him again?"
"15221100","15223500"," Oh yeah, I've made way more of my calls than my spy puts."
"15226480","15227800"," My spy puts are nothing. "
"15229440","15230340"," I'm in the way green."
"15231820","15234360"," When we're down here, you need to have protection."
"15234940","15236640"," Snap is starting to turn up recurrently. "
"15237820","15242200"," Yes, all the daily SMAs and the 1 minute chart are ripping underneath it currently."
"15243340","15244600"," There's unusual options activity."
"15245320","15247880"," It started at 3-2-3-2-24. "
"15248100","15249620"," It's now up to 3-2-4-1."
"15252000","15254860"," Looks like I'm going to get a quick snap spike."
"15259240","15262000"," There have been call options all day long in Snap. "
"15262160","15262980"," I can run through them."
"15270400","15272800"," I've got a total of one or at least that my scanner."
"15272960","15277200"," I've got $1.3 million February 18-32 C."
"15279920","15281900"," March 18-35 C."
"15282700","15284180"," April 14-38 C."
"15285720","15290780"," The largest concentration is on February 4-32-34 C."
"15304860","15309000"," I've made more money for my calls than my put spreads. "
"15309200","15310280"," I'm still holding on my put spreads."
"15310400","15310920"," I haven't sold them."
"15311460","15314080"," I'm not going to sell until we break above for 60. "
"15315420","15317300"," They're dated out to OPEX."
"15318020","15321420"," If we can't break for 60, I expect we trade backwards."
"15324880","15327140"," They're all paid for at this point. "
"15338070","15340090"," Just as like, what the hell is he talking about?"
"15345550","15351510"," If you put together Brian Watts' scripts, you start adding in."
"15352130","15353770"," A, M, C, Dan Hagen."
"15353970","15360470"," This goes into 6.5% passive stake in the A, M, C, X, A, M, C networks. "
"15361070","15362290"," Michael Charlie X, right?"
"15366310","15367430"," That's A, M, C, networks."
"15369570","15370770"," Yeah, passing that one."
"15375320","15379780"," If you put together like all Brian Watts' shit, you look at like volume profile, you do traditional"
"15379780","15380480"," charting methods. "
"15381500","15382700"," Look at a couple LA wave guys."
"15385460","15387460"," I added a sprinkle spot camera."
"15388020","15389040"," I added some book map. "
"15390060","15391040"," Talked some friends."
"15393720","15395800"," You should get pretty close to where we're going."
"15396360","15397920"," Pretty good idea where we're headed. "
"15398580","15399720"," There's a couple YouTubers out there."
"15399920","15403600"," I like Bob Kendall still."
"15403920","15404920"," Still follow him. "
"15406660","15411360"," I haven't been watching his videos, but he does tweet every now and again."
"15412080","15413180"," I'll follow his tweets."
"15418300","15419700"," I generally trust him. "
"15419820","15422460"," He gets calls wrong too, but he's generally right most of the time."
"15425240","15429640"," I like his insight because he's been trading for many, many, many, many, many, many years."
"15430720","15431740"," Full school market maker. "
"15437860","15440420"," I just want to break above this zone right here."
"15442080","15446480"," I'm going to pick this back up right at like 4.56, 98, somewhere in there."
"15446920","15448420"," We're at the last of these sellers. "
"15451100","15451760"," Get closer."
"15452620","15453920"," See if we can break above here."
"15456200","15457660"," Just all this ice right here. "
"15458280","15460220"," All this shit right here I want to get through."
"15466450","15467790"," And just to go back to that conversation."
"15471130","15472150"," Just to see it back. "
"15472290","15478910"," Yeah, we're did in the middle exactly where you don't want to really be in a position right now."
"15481590","15490240"," So you're when you trade up here from 4.20, right?"
"15491080","15492720"," You want to take that look above."
"15493440","15503080"," And that's what that look above is that between 4.56. 4.57 ish to 4.60."
"15504540","15505480"," That's the look above. "
"15505880","15508340"," So you don't trade this high up not to look above."
"15508340","15512760"," Does that mean you're going to go above and then trade to all time highs?"
"15512940","15513440"," Probably not."
"15513620","15514260"," You'll look above. "
"15514740","15520500"," If it's accepted, well, trade sideways, consolidate, and then look to make the next move higher."
"15521000","15524620"," Because it was a lot of work to get from 4.20 to 4.60, right?"
"15524920","15530820"," So it doesn't mean that you when you go to 4.46 or 4.57, you're going to smash through"
"15530820","15533520"," 4.60 and then run up to all time highs."
"15533700","15538320"," What you typically do is all that work that you put in is for you to look above. "
"15538320","15541560"," And break through that major resistance channel that we're in."
"15542100","15542980"," We talk about, right?"
"15543620","15550360"," And then if we are accepted there, we'll rest above, we'll consolidate, then we'll make a new move"
"15550360","15551660"," to higher numbers."
"15551820","15553060"," And that actually kind of coincides, right?"
"15553160","15559580"," If you trade above and start trading down in sideways and the OPEX, slightly down into OPEX, then"
"15559580","15561060"," we trade higher to all time highs. "
"15561840","15567540"," And then we trade down into March for the rate scare that we'll most definitely have."
"15568240","15573600"," You know, the most definitely have your most, your no news for this year are going to be all your"
"15573600","15574000"," rate hikes."
"15575100","15579020"," It's going to be the election in November. "
"15580120","15584680"," So we've got some built in volatility into the year as it is."
"15587040","15588700"," Buying vol is going to be good this year."
"15589460","15591440"," Even if we trade positive on the year. "
"15593260","15595460"," Look like it might break through here, getting closer."
"15596340","15598700"," If we can see if we can break through, make this breakout."
"15601640","15603800"," Almost there, breaking out for the spy right now. "
"15609420","15610400"," About to break out."
"15610540","15610940"," This is good."
"15618280","15619660"," Almost about to start squeezing. "
"15620440","15621980"," This is a nice squeeze level."
"15622640","15624880"," If we break out from here, you're going to see a huge squeeze."
"15630720","15632380"," You should be able to trade to 460. "
"15634220","15635140"," That's the price target."
"15636140","15637420"," Zero XX, one X."
"15637540","15640160"," Carrying in apparently and a Canadian IT service provider."
"15640860","15641740"," X-ray on the X-ray. "
"15643620","15646870"," That term's not disclosed."
"15657110","15657970"," Very nice."
"15658430","15660130"," Watching SPX calls. "
"15661010","15663050"," February 2, forty-five, eighty."
"15664410","15665270"," Rock and roll."
"15667190","15667510"," Spy calls. "
"15668370","15669250"," February 2, fourteen."
"15669250","15673170"," 15s, Camessa, the new CEO, effective March 1st."
"15676700","15678300"," More Nvidia calls coming in. "
"15678360","15680420"," It's critical for a new echo in Spain."
"15683080","15694080"," More spy calls coming in February 11th and February 4th, 251C"
"15694080","15696540"," and 25116 respectively."
"15697280","15697660"," Scratch that. "
"15698360","15698660"," Sorry about that."
"15699160","15699820"," We start over there."
"15699820","15704100"," Nvidia calls February 11th, 265C, $113,000. "
"15704720","15709580"," Nvidia calls February 4th, 250C, $177,000."
"15715150","15716430"," Got a breakthrough here."
"15748000","15750560"," Yeah, we'll look at Google next, too. "
"15750660","15753380"," Google just came up and bounced off the top of 3,000."
"15765110","15766070"," Nvidia making a huge run."
"15766210","15766930"," We looked at that earlier. "

"15814800","15818140"," Bulls where we expected, right, at that 450 zone."
"15818960","15821060"," That's where the real, real dumping began. "
"15823520","15826460"," If we can break above here, we should start moving."
"15834840","15840420"," I wish we could see 10 million in spy calls coming in right at this moment."

"15913550","15914810"," And we've got a little bit of runway. "
"15916110","15918570"," You know, we were losing runway as the day moves on."
"15918630","15920170"," It's already one o'clock in the afternoon."
"15931150","15932310"," I can see just talking. "
"15939380","15941380"," Thanks to the heads up on the gold catching a bid."
"15941380","15948840"," Good job, cowboy starfish."
"15949340","15959240"," I don't think I've seen a lot"
"15959240","15960820"," on Amazon today in call volume. "
"15961580","15964740"," I haven't seen a lot of call volume in Facebook, Amazon."
"15975370","15979430"," Looks like the banks were really pissed off on Amazon catching a bid, huh?"
"15980610","15981850"," Thanks for like, nope."
"15984370","15992830"," No, no, no. "

"16001830","16004310"," Trying to keep it around this area of 3000."
"16005410","16006970"," The fact that it hasn't reported yet."
"16018140","16023560"," From the comment that the Russian government saying that U.S. troop moves to Europe justifying"
"16023560","16024800"," Russia's concerns. "
"16026480","16027520"," Oh shit."
"16027900","16028440"," Did you hear that?"
"16032630","16033330"," That's good."
"16033410","16033810"," I like that. "
"16036370","16037670"," The Russia has concerns."

"16086280","16088120"," Someone asked earlier in the chat about Ford. "
"16089040","16090040"," What are my thoughts on Ford?"
"16090580","16091860"," I'll be honest with you."
"16092060","16092460"," On Ford."
"16093700","16095180"," I'd be wary on Ford. "
"16096540","16097520"," My weariness."
"16098140","16099400"," Well, we go through the rest of it."
"16099480","16102080"," We've got Pinterest on Thursday After the Close as well. "
"16102280","16102540"," Unity."
"16102820","16104320"," We saw Unity calls come in earlier."

"16110180","16112580"," Friday is kind of a, you know, Bristol Myers."
"16114180","16117880"," That Santa Fe, Regeneron, CBOE."
"16117880","16120660"," There was some good news that came in, I think, on CBOE. "
"16121740","16122260"," Aeon."
"16122660","16123980"," We've got Royal Caribbean Group."
"16125400","16127280"," Air Products, Brookfield Twist. "
"16127800","16131420"," Keto, too, is After Thursday, Big Tech is done, right?"
"16131520","16132140"," It's done its thing."
"16132680","16134260"," Now, let's go to Ford real quick."
"16134800","16136400"," I have one issue with Ford. "
"16136500","16137400"," I've got to be honest with you."
"16138700","16140640"," Ford has some problems."
"16141440","16147860"," Ford problems to me range from heavy sellers coming in now. "
"16148780","16150160"," That doesn't mean much, though."
"16151220","16152160"," It's good to have them."
"16152280","16154380"," We're deleting the sellers right now. "
"16154420","16154640"," It's fine."
"16154740","16158220"," We're looking for a switch from a sell to a buy side."
"16158220","16160120"," It doesn't look like we're getting this early. "
"16160220","16160900"," It's already one o'clock."
"16162040","16163160"," Not getting it yet."
"16163880","16165540"," But just back on the Ford thing. "
"16165660","16173160"," The one issue with Ford is Joe Harper was saying the other day, talking about how, you know, not to"
"16173160","16180180"," do a comparison of Tesla and Ford, but Tesla's able to use less microchips."
"16181300","16184740"," And Ford has microchips for everything, every component of their vehicle."
"16185500","16189300"," And Ford isn't as nimble as being able to adjust to chip shortages. "
"16190840","16192300"," But that's not really the big issue."
"16192440","16194740"," The big issue is that we have shortages."
"16195480","16200300"," The truth is there are going to be shortages that are extending farther than we anticipated. "
"16202280","16204920"," Here you go."
"16208040","16212880"," By May 20 for 70 C."
"16214880","16216380"," Four point two million dollars."
"16216880","16218600"," That's what you want to see right now where we're at. "
"16218740","16223510"," You want to see a big fat call block come in right where we are."
"16224590","16226270"," But you know, Ford has a problem."
"16226390","16228550"," And that is in the last two years, right?"
"16229310","16235850"," Ford needed to work on not needing chips. "
"16237330","16244750"," They needed to work on being able to produce enough vehicles so that there isn't as much scarcity."
"16245770","16248510"," That they come equipped with most of what they're supposed to have."
"16250880","16256520"," Ford should have been farther along with deliveries and electric vehicle plan. "
"16256520","16259700"," And they'll fall behind eventually."
"16260420","16264080"," So I think they're going to say, hey, we made bank this this quarter."
"16264320","16266120"," That's what I think they're going to say like we had a great quarter. "
"16266300","16267260"," Everything was rocking and rolling."
"16267680","16273540"," You know that the dealers, the dealers are telling buyers, hey, look, we have set costs."
"16273780","16274100"," We can't. "
"16274160","16277480"," We have to sell these vehicles over markup regardless, right?"
"16279590","16280830"," So they're going to say they had a great quarter."
"16281010","16285950"," But I think that their guidance is going to start getting weaker over time."
"16286690","16292330"," And I think the damage is done to a lot of companies that didn't spend their time and money wisely"
"16292330","16294010"," the last two years. "
"16294670","16296550"," So I'm bearish on Ford."
"16298370","16298990"," I am."
"16300250","16303550"," I'm more bearish on Ford than I am with Tesla, believe it or not. "
"16305890","16308930"," And I was shocked that Tesla's guidance call."
"16309470","16312290"," I don't think that Ford can be that nimble at this point."
"16313070","16315130"," I feel like Ford took the money and ran. "
"16315950","16317030"," I shouldn't say that."
"16317250","16323210"," I mean, we can talk semantics about them working on the electric truck and how many sales they've"
"16323210","16325870"," had and that they're going to be behind because of the demand for them."
"16326390","16328650"," But the reality is it looks more. "
"16332180","16338600"," I don't know if it's that they're betting with the EV is a fat or anything like that."
"16338660","16341640"," I think that they just can't move as fast."
"16342360","16343880"," And so their recovery will be slower. "
"16345710","16347130"," I think they're losing years."
"16348370","16348910"," Right now."
"16353380","16354060"," On Ford. "
"16357720","16360080"," Yeah, I know about the USB ports being ripped out."
"16361040","16361980"," Yeah, you can say that."
"16362120","16363200"," I understand you guys think that. "
"16364020","16365060"," So what we'll do is this."
"16365220","16366260"," This is a good fit."
"16366400","16367260"," There's a fair point, right?"
"16367420","16367900"," You guys are arguments. "
"16368040","16368220"," I understand."
"16368740","16371700"," So we'll do is this is we'll listen into the Ford guidance."
"16372540","16373660"," Because I live in Detroit. "
"16373860","16377320"," I know a lot of these guys that work for friends with some of these guys that work for Ford."
"16378120","16379400"," To be honest with you."
"16379400","16384950"," And they got problems. "
"16385790","16386270"," We'll see."
"16386910","16388970"," We'll watch it together and see what the guidance says."
"16396259","16397080"," We will see. "
"16397279","16398540"," We will watch Ford together."
"16399599","16402380"," We'll watch the guidance and see what they have to say inside the guidance."
"16404340","16406119"," The Ford's trading at 2119. "
"16408980","16409460"," Right?"
"16412380","16414720"," At its peak it was at 20 peak."
"16415740","16416660"," Twenty five."
"16418980","16420919"," Twenty five eight seventy right. "
"16422919","16425540"," Wouldn't be shocking to see him trade up to twenty two."
"16426000","16427040"," Take the profit and run."
"16427800","16428740"," That's what I'm going to bet. "
"16439980","16442880"," It's going to move and promises they can't deliver."
"16447800","16450020"," If you look at Ford right now, right?"
"16450020","16454259"," Look at as I got to be honest, I posted this."
"16454919","16460480"," If you're going to have a Ford truck right now that's gone up in pricing to stupid levels like. "
"16461259","16465640"," People are buying forts for like $120,000, $140,000, $60,000."
"16466480","16467880"," Those people are going to get fucked."
"16468960","16472460"," And you can't if they get the Tesla trucks rolling out at any point. "
"16472460","16478340"," For the energy markets, changing Morgan head of the commodity strategy, Geneva, and the TV"
"16478340","16483540"," interviews saying that oil could hit $120 a barrel to your political risks escalate."
"16484160","16484560"," Woo."
"16485980","16486919"," Woo hoo. "
"16489520","16492000"," All right."
"16492140","16493980"," So I got gas going through the frickin roof."
"16493980","16494279"," Right?"
"16494460","16496520"," That helps Ford in their ice vehicles. "
"16500060","16501779"," I'll be honest with you."
"16501779","16503200"," We look at the guidance on Ford."
"16503360","16506080"," I want to see it because I'm going to tell you right way at some point, right?"
"16506400","16508140"," You're seeing more and more Teslas on the road. "
"16510380","16514520"," You're if you're Joe, if you start seeing Tesla trucks on the road, right?"
"16514619","16516140"," And you're Joe Handyman or you Joe."
"16517640","16520360"," Rufer or Joe, like painter or something."
"16521599","16526660"," And you're looking at $140,000 truck or a used truck for stupid money. "
"16527180","16530980"," And if Tesla get those trucks on the road, they have to."
"16531619","16534779"," That's how they, they have a chance of taking some of that market."
"16535900","16536619"," They really do. "
"16536700","16538220"," Another car company is two, not just Tesla."
"16540080","16542560"," It's the producing, getting trucks out there."
"16543779","16544680"," Cars out there. "
"16554259","16556279"," Opponents as well to be installed at the arrows later."
"16557720","16559060"," Yeah, I'm always blaming Joe for shit."
"16560580","16562619"," It's not just the F-250, super. "
"16563099","16568820"," Dude, I just watched the video on, I just watched the video on, uh, Well, I don't think they make"
"16568820","16569040"," great."
"16570160","16571840"," See, I don't think this is about making great cars."
"16572460","16574480"," I think this is about how much a car costs. "
"16575680","16578119"," I don't think this is about that they make the best cars or great cars."
"16578860","16581099"," I think it has to do with how much a car costs."
"16582099","16585640"," I think at the end of the day, people do care about how much of a vehicle costs. "
"16586259","16589439"," I don't think it's like, it's not me, but I know some people do care."
"16592740","16595840"," I think that they can't afford $140,000 truck."
"16597140","16601580"," I don't think that every carpenter and every drywall or every painter can afford it. "
"16601779","16604119"," Some can, but not all of them."
"16604259","16605520"," Not the majority of them."
"16610450","16611689"," I'm not saying it's for everybody. "
"16616070","16617689"," I'm talking about guidance here."
"16618009","16622009"," That's the only reverse repo operation AD counterpart is taking $1.63 trillion."
"16624630","16625509"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"16625710","16627570"," The government showed up for reverse repos today."
"16634669","16635890"," I'm talking about guidance."
"16636970","16640849"," I'm not talking about what Ford's going to say. "
"16640930","16641490"," They're making money."
"16641650","16643250"," I know Ford's going to say they're making bank."
"16644610","16646490"," I think that Ford's losing ground. "
"16654720","16656800"," Tell your Facebook flow over all."
"16659040","16661540"," Yeah, I'll look right now and see if I find anything Facebook."
"16667930","16669349"," Snap's still not doing nothing. "
"16670110","16671250"," I've spoken with a stick."
"16674640","16676360"," Facebook, two orders."
"16679840","16683020"," March 18, 360 C."
"16684660","16688220"," $216,000 placed at 1126 this morning. "
"16690700","16692840"," February 11, 350 C."
"16696779","16698500"," For $153,000."
"16701439","16703619"," I was placed at 951 this morning."
"16706500","16708680"," It almost looks like they're shorting. "
"16710240","16711779"," I don't have the time to do it right now."
"16712520","16719710"," But if any of you guys are members of Spa Gamma, I can check right now."
"16719890","16720050"," Hold on. "
"16720050","16722689"," I can look to see if it's heavily shorted."
"16725849","16728189"," I see two Facebook puts."
"16730029","16731930"," February 18, 300 P."
"16733009","16736470"," For a grand total of almost $700,000. "
"16737910","16741470"," I wonder if Ford or Facebook is heavily shorted right now."
"16741970","16743189"," And on Spa Gamma, I can check."
"16744070","16746490"," Let me look and see. "
"16747930","16755570"," A lot of it."
"16781790","16782730"," Just a minute."
"16782890","16784410"," I've got to get into it real quick. "
"16796590","16798150"," I see transfer needs."
"16798230","16803910"," He puts a general charge in the company unit with environmental crimes related to revolution"
"16803910","16805370"," natural gas pipe construction."
"16806130","16835430"," Yeah, it's being"
"16835430","16836150"," shorted heavily. "
"16837910","16838590"," Facebook."
"16842710","16852630"," It's like number 15 on most heavily shorted"
"16852630","16852890"," stocks."
"16854070","16857650"," Or it has hedging against it since they shorted. "
"16857770","16858770"," I'm assuming that it's shorted."
"16859430","16862150"," It has a heavy, heavy put or put hedging on it."
"16868240","16869940"," Bounce off 3,000 on Google. "
"16873260","16875020"," Train below VWAP on Google."

"16894870","16915900"," 0.923. 0.900. The"
"16915900","16919660"," top gamma expiry on Facebook is February 18."
"16920260","16925260"," So if you want to take a long in Facebook, you might have to wait until after a year."
"16928440","16941880"," And it"
"16941880","16945740"," comes after the Northern Ireland agricultural minister said he issued an order to hold. "
"16946960","16949080"," Order checks on Irish C."
"16980020","16981160"," I think when you guys."
"16981620","16983660"," So let's talk about EVs real quick in politics."
"16986260","16989800"," So I drive ice vehicles and I drive EVs, right?"
"16989800","16998200"," I think you have to look at it from the perspective of GM's going all EV, right?"
"17000460","17002000"," No, this doesn't mean you can't. "
"17002220","17003840"," There won't be uses for diesels."
"17003960","17006000"," It's not that there won't be uses for ice vehicles."
"17006320","17006900"," I've lived all over. "
"17007000","17009020"," I've lived at 14,000 feet above sea level."
"17009580","17011120"," There's no EV driving up there currently."
"17011780","17012380"," Not going to happen. "
"17013380","17016620"," You know for military functions, you're not going to be able to use."
"17017260","17019900"," There's always going to be reasons for needing gas vehicles."
"17021920","17024220"," But if you look at most of the world, right?"
"17024800","17030260"," Most of the world is switching over for everyday drivers to EVs and trucks where they can use them. "
"17030340","17030780"," That kind of stuff."
"17031060","17031580"," That's the future."
"17032020","17033240"," Think about it when you're a kid, right?"
"17035740","17038580"," And you think about your future and what's going to happen, right?"
"17038740","17040080"," Or what's taking place in the future?"
"17040800","17043980"," Remember in the 1970s when I was a kid that I wasn't born. "
"17043980","17047780"," But there was a need for better running vehicles."
"17048160","17049920"," Big three were making shit vehicles."
"17050340","17052480"," Japan stepped in and made better running vehicles. "
"17053140","17054600"," They filled a niche in a need."
"17055260","17057020"," And all vehicles kind of moved towards that."
"17057220","17060660"," Even American vehicles moved towards that standard as time progressed. "
"17062200","17066540"," So I think what we're trying to point to is that the writing is in the wall for electric vehicles"
"17066540","17068480"," out there."
"17068900","17072840"," And it's not a political statement to say I drive an electric vehicle or an ice vehicle or"
"17072840","17073020"," whatever."
"17074960","17081340"," Oftentimes I think we mix up politics with as a stock trader what you need to be looking for for"
"17081340","17081700"," the future. "
"17082020","17088600"," So my point is separate the politics from your trading and investing and look towards what the"
"17088600","17089140"," future is."
"17089280","17092000"," So if you're, if you like, hey, I want Ford to make the best truck in the world."
"17092000","17096600"," That's electric or whatever or, you know, gas is the future. "
"17097100","17097460"," Whatever."
"17097640","17101380"," It's not that we won't always have gas will always have gas will always have oil will always have"
"17101380","17101740"," plastics."
"17102220","17105280"," I don't believe the bullshit with we're never going to need that stuff. "
"17105500","17111680"," I'm looking at it from the traders perspective, the investors perspective and what the future is"
"17111680","17112820"," for the market."
"17113100","17115820"," So if you're like, well, fuck Tesla, I fucking hate it."
"17115960","17116400"," That's fine. "
"17116840","17121540"," But if you're going to look towards Ford to be the leader of selling EVs or to have a major"
"17121540","17127700"," market share in EVs as a trader, as an investor hat, right, not the main street hat, then you want"
"17127700","17131420"," to be hearing them addressing those issues as they move forward."
"17131420","17135520"," Because Ford's had problems in the past with making shipboxes, right?"
"17135720","17141440"," They fucked this up in the past with movements in the car industry and McCaw with their pants down"
"17141440","17142240"," in the past."
"17142460","17145140"," Chevy has, we know they all have at some point. "
"17145280","17148500"," Most of the big American car makers have been caught with their pants down."
"17148880","17152720"," And so as an investor, even in Ford, you want to be holding the pedal to the metal with those"
"17152720","17158400"," guys and being like, Hey, what are you doing for the future of the car industry, general car"
"17158400","17158740"," industry?"
"17158740","17166180"," And then if you look at other countries, right, if you go to busy places, you're listening to trade"
"17166180","17167020"," the news."
"17167480","17173420"," If you go to dense population centers, EVs are everywhere. "
"17173880","17174500"," They're everywhere."
"17174740","17176520"," If you like, you know, I've lived everywhere."
"17176740","17177660"," I mean, I've lived up in Montana. "
"17177680","17182540"," I've lived out in the mountains of Colorado in Park City in Utah and places like that."
"17182880","17185400"," And yeah, you don't see EVs race around everywhere."
"17185400","17186020"," You see big trucks. "
"17186160","17189240"," Everybody's got a big four-wheel drive truck or they've got Subaru's, right?"
"17189720","17193960"," But if you travel around the world, you spend places out of places, you can see that it's the"
"17193960","17194200"," future."
"17195140","17195940"," It really is."
"17196440","17199520"," It doesn't make it better clean or better for the environment and that kind of shit. "
"17199920","17201580"," You just know that it's the future."
"17201880","17205560"," So if you're going to invest in Ford, they got to be doing something for that."
"17205720","17207580"," You see even GM's moving over to that. "
"17207840","17208400"," So it's not."
"17208660","17213800"," It's more about money than it is from my perspective than the political side of it."
"17220410","17225310"," Yeah, I don't really care about all the like all the fluff for Tesla. "
"17226930","17228170"," There are Teslas in Montana."
"17228170","17229270"," I can't say there aren't."
"17229650","17231650"," I'm not saying there's no Teslas in Montana. "
"17232330","17234590"," I'll just say my point is that."
"17235670","17238550"," I'm looking at it from a money perspective."
"17239010","17241330"," I'm like, how am I going to make money as an investor?"
"17241330","17247150"," I'll leave the politics out there for Joe six pack and soup six pack. "
"17247750","17256550"," And for Karen hippie and for, you know, hipster Jimmy from San Fran."
"17256910","17261750"," I'll leave all that shit to the side because all I really care about is where's the money at?"
"17261890","17262590"," Where's the future at?"
"17263250","17266550"," And I was bringing up the kid thing because I think about that with Roblox."
"17266550","17269590"," Like when I was a kid, my parents would ask me what I thought the future was. "
"17269730","17270530"," And my parents thought I was crazy."
"17271370","17273890"," You know, my parents thought I was crazy when I was on the internet when I was a kid."
"17274570","17275790"," I was in the early chat rooms. "
"17275970","17279390"," I was in those and people thought of even adults that were young thought I was crazy."
"17279950","17282850"," And I'm looking at my kids right now and they're on Roblox and shit like that."
"17283510","17284350"," And what do I do?"
"17284470","17285110"," Do I tell my kids?"
"17285450","17286470"," Well, that's not the future. "
"17287550","17287870"," Right."
"17288030","17290890"," I have to be open minded to what younger people are saying."
"17291790","17293690"," The future is and what they're going to pursue. "
"17295330","17297210"," Even if I disagree with her, I don't believe it."
"17299620","17300480"," That's what the money is at."
"17308340","17311060"," If Elon Musk died to the stock would be 50 bucks. "
"17311540","17312440"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"17312660","17315120"," He's trying to get more leadership in there."
"17315300","17317320"," He needs, I will agree 100%. "
"17317320","17322080"," Elon Musk needs a partner or a predecessor at this point."
"17323360","17324980"," He needs a face bad."
"17331480","17333000"," I have family members that work for Tesla. "
"17333000","17336760"," So I got to make that known like family members."
"17339260","17341500"," I don't want you guys to think that I'm biased or anything."
"17342020","17345800"," They have the same problem that he has a problem with the door alignments and the panel gaps. "
"17346280","17347720"," Those are a long time ago though too."
"17348040","17350860"," They still have them, but they were really an issue back in the day."
"17351420","17352860"," Like mid 2000s, I think. "
"17359560","17362180"," Yeah, the whole the the power grid thing pisses me off with."
"17362480","17366300"," I think I'm a firm believer in that we need nuclear power."
"17367780","17369160"," I'm for nuclear power. "
"17370140","17379820"," And I actually think that when you think about gas and oil and lubricants, plastics, I don't think"
"17379820","17380440"," we can leave."
"17382060","17383100"," Well, this is another thing."
"17383360","17385780"," I don't think Elon thinks that gas is going anywhere. "
"17386520","17387660"," I think that's a misnomer too."
"17388100","17392880"," I think for the expansion of the human race for us to get off world, you have to stop using"
"17392880","17400040"," fuels and lubricants and oils for us plebs because they're going to need them for expansion to get"
"17400040","17401120"," off the earth."
"17402320","17404740"," I think they'll always be a need for oil and gas. "
"17405460","17406940"," I don't think that ever goes away."
"17407060","17408500"," I just think the usage is of it changes."
"17416670","17420630"," You have an EV when I slander over my gospels, not basically gone to my power, but when I'm 40"
"17420630","17421190"," bucks a month. "
"17421470","17421510"," Yeah."
"17423850","17426350"," L O four L.O.F. four is correct on that."
"17427670","17434790"," There's all kinds of bullshit products and bullshit politics and nuclear power too. "
"17437060","17443640"," I've actually been to some universities to listen to speaking engagements on this with very smart"
"17443640","17444080"," people."
"17446660","17450000"," Well, you know, it's funny is that really doesn't like nuclear power."
"17450200","17454260"," They have nuclear reactors that can't be turned into military uses. "
"17454920","17456200"," But you don't want to hear that."
"17456380","17458380"," No one with politics are all bullshit on that stuff."
"17459680","17460460"," But it's a must. "
"17461120","17467080"," Nuclear power is a must for the expansion of probably need on the couple generations to die off or"
"17467080","17468780"," nuclear power to take hold, but it's required."
"17473340","17478840"," You need nuclear power and you will need no matter what you guys say."
"17478980","17484000"," You guys say like a corn vegetable oil is the way for lubricants. "
"17484180","17486040"," Well, I'll be honest with you."
"17486040","17490720"," The real, real, real beauty of oil is plastics and lubricants."
"17491920","17492840"," You just can't. "
"17493660","17497880"," We would be in the stone age without plastics and lubricants."
"17498840","17499680"," Say that one more time."
"17499900","17503600"," We'd be in the stone age without plastics and lubricants. "
"17505740","17511420"," It is the reason we're in the industrialized revolution or we had the industrial revolution."
"17512140","17515080"," More so than machines, plastics and lubricants."
"17516280","17517180"," I just get tipped. "
"17517520","17518680"," Josh, thanks for the tip, brother."
"17522480","17526640"," Hey, Frank H, I appreciate the support, brother."
"17527900","17529580"," Josh, well, thank you for the support. "
"17531400","17532020"," Appreciate it."
"17532580","17533920"," You guys will see more coming down the line here."
"17537100","17538820"," Yeah, even Toyotas against EVs. "
"17540720","17542080"," Yeah, lots of medicines are there."
"17542740","17551260"," If you looked at it, if you looked at if you looked at the uses for oils for lubricants and"
"17551260","17552780"," stuff like that, it's in everything."
"17553260","17553960"," In every single thing. "
"17554500","17556540"," The only reason we're all living in the stone age."
"17556780","17557360"," Can you not?"
"17563130","17568430"," Yeah, I don't think that it's weird."
"17568790","17576830"," My take on Elon Musk is a way different than most people's way, way, way different. "
"17578790","17583710"," I don't see like I see the boring company as more being able to build tunnels on Mars or on"
"17583710","17583990"," the moon."
"17585110","17587910"," Or you could mine if you're mining on an asteroid or something."
"17588050","17589430"," If you're looking to expand the human race. "
"17591350","17595970"," I feel as though we have to be able to leave Earth to save humanity."
"17597250","17601050"," Poorly, nearly doubles a jump on offering the $950 million."
"17601710","17602190"," Yeah. "
"17603670","17608510"," Previously approved a $500 million senior secure note offering due to 2029."
"17609130","17610110"," Now Michael Charlie."
"17613760","17619460"," Yeah, I think it's more has more to do with other countries in their A.I. The threat of other"
"17619460","17625920"," countries A.I. It has to do with geopolitics has to do with existential threats to the human race. "
"17627280","17629800"," And so when I see stuff like that when I see EVs."
"17630700","17636900"," When I see a guy like Elon Musk, I look towards a guy like a Howard Hughes."
"17637660","17641640"," You know, we look at other countries that are putting way much in their education into"
"17641640","17642060"," intelligence. "
"17642940","17646480"," And then you get a guy like like Elon Musk, he makes mistakes, he fucks things up."
"17647440","17650220"," I get the fraud arguments sometimes, but at the same time, what are you going to do?"
"17650360","17654920"," Burn down everybody we got in this country with any that can actually get by all the bullshit to"
"17654920","17655540"," try to do something."
"17656320","17657300"," I think that's the wrong move. "
"17657300","17659560"," I think the embrace a guy like Elon Musk."
"17661520","17665120"," And you try to you try to move forward our country as the leader of the world."
"17665900","17671520"," In science in, you know, it's just like it's just like Albert Einstein, right?"
"17672240","17673280"," They didn't want him over in Germany. "
"17673280","17674060"," So we took him."
"17675400","17680020"," So any any smart guys that you can get a smart women and you let them run and try to"
"17680020","17680700"," make better stuff."
"17681260","17683700"," Make us the best in the world down with that. "
"17683700","17697880"," Yeah, I'll"
"17697880","17699200"," get this card link to you guys right now."
"17702070","17704070"," Like, I was looking at a map of Starlink the other day."
"17704250","17704690"," It was wild. "
"17704890","17706550"," I was looking at the map Starlink the other day."
"17707210","17711030"," And you could see every country that it's not allowed to operate in, but there's still satellites"
"17711030","17711370"," above."
"17711950","17719910"," And I wonder if there was a world before, you know, does any other nation have a sky net of"
"17719910","17722470"," satellites over every nation in this world?"
"17723110","17726330"," And if you think that if you think the US government's never wrapped up and you're crazy. "
"17727290","17733730"," Like, even if you're like super pro American, just look at the future of Elon Musk in terms of his"
"17733730","17735110"," relationship to our government."
"17736730","17738870"," I'm just looking at purely from the standpoint of money."
"17746730","17749570"," Yeah, and I want Ford to have a future plan. "
"17750830","17753010"," I have I have no ill will towards Ford."
"17753890","17756030"," I get pissed off that Ford isn't doing its thing."
"17760590","17762870"," I would actually expect Ford to take the lead. "
"17764850","17765590"," In EV."
"17766870","17770230"," And I think I don't think Elon Musk would be have a problem with that either."
"17774600","17776360"," And that sounds so bizarre to say. "
"17778180","17782140"," But I don't think that I don't think Elon Musk would actually have a problem with Ford started"
"17782140","17783660"," leading the way in EV."
"17788260","17793040"," I think his thought process is a lot is more more geared towards."
"17794400","17795120"," Something else. "
"17807450","17808430"," Thank tighter guys."
"17815860","17817040"," Yeah, I have I have."
"17818480","17819240"," Depends on us. "
"17819360","17821260"," He works the areas in both the direction."
"17821860","17822900"," Yeah, I think you have to look at it."
"17822960","17824700"," There's so much more to be looking at than. "
"17833550","17835890"," I think Elon Musk looks up to Ford too."
"17836230","17838530"," I think when you look at Ford, it's creation."
"17838870","17839230"," It's founding. "
"17840370","17842550"," It's it's important to our economy."
"17842730","17845570"," It's important to industrialized nation."
"17846170","17847310"," That we created right. "
"17847510","17848810"," The mobility of the United States."
"17851570","17853290"," Any any of those guys that are like that."
"17854050","17855190"," We can count them right. "
"17855370","17856090"," There's a ton of them."
"17859370","17863030"," Elon Musk probably has more in common with Ford than anybody working at Ford right now in"

"17864070","17865770"," With the founder of Ford. "
"17866850","17867690"," With Henry Ford."
"17875550","17876430"," Yeah, I get that."
"17876830","17877310"," You know, winky. "
"17877810","17878530"," I agree with you with that."
"17881290","17882930"," I agree with you with that winky."
"17883530","17883930"," 100%. "
"17884650","17887090"," That shit pissed me off and it still pisses me off today."
"17891760","17893920"," I know these just fucking around trying to have fun and shit."
"17897380","17899440"," This is looking good for a spy right here. "
"17950400","17951620"," I think I get to get very quick."
"18122800","18125200"," Yeah, so I'm reading some of you guys comments right now."

"18129930","18130430"," I'm a."
"18140550","18143130"," Yeah, I'm gonna tell my Tesla bull just be just to be clear."
"18145230","18148450"," But I don't think I'm a Tesla bull for the same reasons that a lot of people are Tesla bulls."
"18150290","18151390"," I'm unsure of that. "
"18153110","18156370"," I look at it more from like national security perspective."
"18170730","18172170"," From a geopolitical perspective."
"18173270","18175030"," More than the United States will be in 100 years. "
"18175710","18177670"," I know we get a lot of problems as a country, but."
"18194340","18195040"," Yeah, but I do."
"18195100","18196260"," And I do get the Tesla hate. "
"18196360","18197260"," I do get the Elon hate."
"18198040","18199000"," I understand it."
"18202360","18203200"," I've lost money. "
"18204220","18208380"," I've made more money than lost, but I have lost money at times from the tweeting."
"18212700","18214840"," I pissed a lot of investors off two at times."
"18216960","18219380"," Especially if you've been a long time trader and Tesla up or down. "
"18220420","18221380"," You're gonna be anger."
"18225930","18227770"," Here's a move on Tesla right now."
"18229190","18230010"," Not Tesla. "
"18230270","18230510"," Excuse me."
"18230570","18230990"," Spy."
"18233110","18235370"," For net airlines, fortunately considering. "
"18243350","18247310"," A sale of minority statements by which plus operations."
"18248630","18248930"," Beautiful."
"18249150","18259700"," We're really trying"
"18259700","18267940"," on spy right now, aren't we?"
"18268600","18273540"," It's kind of do or die right now on looks like it's do or die right now on the spy. "
"18282110","18285470"," This is a is a bull setup where it appears to be."
"18288570","18290870"," Lots of spy calls are coming in."
"18291090","18294890"," UAL calls are coming in on the news to just can't that just broke on UAL. "
"18295570","18298110"," February 4th, 44C, $105,000."
"18306000","18308520"," I've got some run calls that are dying over here."
"18310480","18311200"," Son run. "
"18311460","18313100"," I haven't traded them in a couple years."
"18313680","18314340"," That's all right."
"18314420","18314880"," I'm in run. "
"18315160","18315880"," Let's see what happens."
"18318960","18322340"," I like the idea of them partnering with Ford."
"18324700","18329280"," There were some other Tesla news that came out this morning on the batteries. "
"18329540","18330720"," I don't know what it was."
"18363740","18368780"," And it's son run ER is like the day before those calls expire day."
"18368920","18369020"," Yeah. "
"18369180","18369200"," Yeah."
"18369440","18370580"," Before that'll be interesting."
"18373680","18374240"," Let's see. "
"18374380","18376140"," I'm going to look at them over the course of a year."
"18378000","18378420"," Yeah."
"18378560","18380780"," They traded down from a hundred bucks to 2170. "
"18382040","18384360"," And I do have a price target here for them to."
"18386080","18387100"," Above a 26."
"18387500","18388980"," So they've traded lower than what I expected. "
"18392460","18393220"," 1975, maybe."
"18393400","18395040"," I think they're already down in 1975."
"18395560","18396900"," I'll stay in those calls though. "
"18397080","18397380"," I don't care."
"18398420","18400080"," I'll keep those and I'll keep the pitons."
"18401000","18402260"," Maybe they'll be my bright, shiny moment. "
"18403320","18404900"," The son run will go up and piton will burn."
"18406560","18415480"," And the fact that son runs trading down at $24 and piton trading at $27 is bullshit."
"18422050","18422730"," That's what it was. "
"18422930","18423130"," How bad?"
"18423490","18423570"," Yeah."
"18423810","18425650"," They get priority for all the new Panasonic battery tech."
"18425650","18426330"," That was this morning. "
"18436220","18438420"," You know, let's talk about something Jo just said."
"18438580","18439620"," I've said dumb things before."
"18439900","18441560"," That doesn't make me a con man or a crook. "
"18442120","18442560"," Shit."
"18444360","18446260"," What about a what about a Ford?"
"18447120","18448620"," You guys know anything about Ford?"
"18451580","18454980"," I moved to Detroit a few years ago and I've gotten to learn."
"18455280","18457400"," I've been able to learn a lot about Ford. "
"18459920","18464100"," It was like Walmart taking a big patch of land and just turning into a parking lot."
"18464680","18466920"," They built air strips on the roads here."
"18467560","18469280"," They called the aviation district. "
"18469540","18470600"," It was their private playground."
"18471760","18471980"," Right?"
"18473060","18475380"," If people move it, move here all over the country to help build cars."
"18475660","18476600"," They worked like dogs. "
"18477800","18478540"," Like dogs."
"18479500","18479780"," Like broke."
"18480120","18481420"," I mean, you worked hard. "
"18483020","18484160"," But you had a job, which was great."
"18485860","18486260"," Right?"
"18486420","18488100"," That great decent standard of living."
"18490160","18492460"," But you can't say that you didn't work, you didn't work, you didn't get worked. "
"18493660","18498820"," There was huge class warfare."
"18499380","18502240"," Not just amongst a racial inequality either."
"18503200","18507120"," Because if you were African American, you could move here and you have a great community, you have"
"18507120","18508440"," a great house, a great job. "
"18509540","18514140"," There was huge segregation at the same time."
"18514780","18517040"," Middle management, white collar management and Ford."
"18519220","18525700"," You talk about like, talk about aristocrat, like an aristocrat type mentality. "
"18525860","18532360"," If Henry Ford, if Elon was like Henry Ford, he'd be calling for his head today."
"18536480","18537880"," And there's other people like that too."
"18538000","18539020"," How hard he is the same way, right?"
"18539140","18539600"," He's an eccentric. "
"18540080","18542280"," But then again, he built all the bombers for us."
"18543280","18543680"," Right?"
"18543920","18545860"," Then you've got the guy from Germany."
"18546200","18552780"," He was the roster, but, you know, there's always something about these people that it's easy to rip"
"18552780","18553360"," out them for. "
"18557510","18557910"," Okay."
"18558150","18558510"," So here we go."
"18558530","18559230"," You guys want some calls?"
"18560030","18562030"," You guys want to know what I think about the clothes, huh?"
"18569650","18570050"," Yeah. "
"18570310","18571470"," Low four is making a good point."
"18571910","18573030"," Herro is negative."
"18573330","18574710"," And so it's negative on..."
"18579420","18579900"," Yeah. "
"18580060","18581720"," The road is successful."
"18582360","18582580"," Yeah."
"18582800","18583120"," Exactly. "
"18583440","18584160"," Your room is getting right."
"18585280","18586320"," So here's the deal."
"18587340","18588680"," As you may take, okay?"
"18589600","18591560"," We talked about runway earlier, right?"
"18591660","18593580"," You only have so much runway in the course of a day. "
"18596480","18599380"," Let's see where we've got buyers now down below here."
"18600700","18603860"," You're seeing sellers hiding above, right?"
"18604920","18606100"," Seeing sellers, they're going to panic."
"18607280","18609460"," See the buyers still down below here, 453. "
"18609760","18610920"," I'm going to tell you a few things."
"18611800","18612620"," Oh, and here they go."
"18612860","18613700"," I didn't have to tell you anymore. "
"18614200","18614680"," Spy."
"18617740","18621220"," February 4th, 450p, $115,000."
"18623480","18625660"," Spy, February, sorry, excuse me. "
"18625840","18630140"," February 22nd, $450p, $1 million."
"18631280","18634560"," Spy, February 22nd, $450p, $1 million."
"18634560","18639220"," Spy, $450p, January 22nd, $1 million. "
"18639940","18642160"," And this is leading into the conversation about to have with you."
"18642940","18645020"," So you're running out of runway today."
"18645680","18646640"," Touched above a few times. "
"18646800","18648380"," You found out there's a ton of sellers above."
"18649040","18650580"," They're going to keep showing up right now."
"18651500","18657700"," My expectation is that we trade sideways and down until we find some support and we wear out"
"18657700","18658140"," sellers. "
"18659300","18662060"," I was trying to explain to you guys earlier, right?"
"18662060","18668560"," I think it was yesterday about where that drop was on 450 and who would actually trap."
"18668920","18672240"," Even the bears didn't think we were trading below 450."
"18672860","18675720"," Master Wu didn't believe we were trading below 450. "
"18676600","18681060"," So when we did that dump below 450, it took a lot of people by surprise."
"18681500","18683000"," Most people didn't call that trade."
"18683720","18687860"," That in and of itself, trapped people into fear. "
"18691220","18696360"," So where we are right now, we didn't reject immediately off."
"18697500","18699440"," We're here to look above at 460."
"18701360","18705040"," We've got bears stepping and this is their last place that they can step in. "
"18705560","18708720"," We've got panic sellers that still want to get out that are hiding."
"18709360","18711460"," I promise you there are bulls out there."
"18711580","18716240"," They're like, we're going to all-time highs only to get you to get us here to 460 so that"
"18716240","18717560"," they can capitulate and sell. "
"18717960","18721340"," It doesn't make me bearish here on this brand that I'm going on."
"18722080","18724040"," But as we go into the close, right?"
"18725380","18728320"," We still have, we have higher volume picking up right now."
"18728860","18732160"," We don't have, we have a negative hero indicator all day long. "
"18732760","18735220"," We've got more sellers than buyers currently."
"18737300","18741580"," It's not setting up right now to squeeze per stay into close."
"18747780","18749780"," We do have an OPEC stay today. "
"18749780","18755510"," Is the OPEC's higher or lower?"
"18756490","18761430"," Probably not at 460 for OPEC's."
"18763050","18764030"," Probably not."
"18764230","18765450"," We can look and see if it is. "
"18765970","18778500"," I think that's"
"18805830","18818360"," some wonky shit going out of my, if I"
"18818360","18820900"," had to guess, they're probably going to park it right around 455."
"18820900","18826780"," 455, 455, 454 into the close."
"18828040","18832220"," Maybe even 453 into the close, if I had to guess. "
"18835320","18841170"," Just for the OPEC stuff is, hold on here."
"18857100","18867030"," Get some wonky shit going on my, what is going on with my, got to reset my"
"18867030","18867750"," entire thing here."
"18870760","18873320"," I'm having some brokerage problems right now. "
"18886330","18889850"," Yeah, we get some sneaky pea."
"18890490","18896950"," Got 107,000 contracts sitting at 450 P on February 4th for Friday."
"18905890","18911170"," Got 245,000 puts on 454 for today. "
"18915860","18917460"," Trying to put it into the close."
"18924860","18926660"," Study supply of dollars at 457."
"18930370","18936270"," Just had more spy puts come in February 22nd, 450 P, $1.1 million. "
"18939190","18945430"," From Magellan's, and they expect a 50% increase in adhesion field demand this year in Michael Papa."
"18949810","18955970"," You have $18.5 million in spy puts coming in for the day so far."
"18955970","18959570"," 8.5 million in spy calls came in today. "
"18964100","18967360"," If it doesn't start to trade down, it still mutes."
"18968180","18971880"," We're spy trades into the close today."
"18977760","18979140"," It still mutes it. "
"18990860","18993520"," I did just see Facebook calls come in."
"18994580","19001440"," Someone was asking about Facebook earlier February 4th, 320 C, $1.3 million baby."
"19001940","19008460"," If that print spy will go up. "
"19011640","19025070"," Looks like"
"19025070","19025770"," a setup though."
"19048290","19050250"," There was some positive news on AAL."
"19051210","19057530"," There's a lot of positive airline news, a bunch of UAL calls, AAL calls, BA calls. "
"19061410","19063890"," One last thing, I don't want to leave one last thing on Tesla."
"19064550","19069170"," I want to say to any of you that don't like Elon Musk or do like Elon Musk, I appreciate"
"19069170","19072710"," that all of you can talk with each other civilly here."
"19073430","19075730"," It's not just a big shit fest. "
"19076710","19080790"," I hope that you guys can always agree and disagree and agree to disagree and that kind of stuff."
"19081670","19085230"," We can have the open discussion and agree and disagree."
"19085850","19088790"," I don't hate anybody that's anti-Tesla or anti Elon Musk. "
"19089150","19093390"," I always want to hear, I have some very close test of key friends on Twitter."
"19094570","19096390"," I said, why you guys to know that?"
"19096990","19098110"," There's like never any will."
"19099070","19102170"," I want you guys to always be able to talk each other open about it. "
"19103290","19103950"," Leave it there."
"19107910","19110450"," What is the likely move on Tesla earnings?"
"19110730","19111390"," Let me take a look and see."
"19115240","19116400"," The implied move. "
"19121750","19122850"," I'll look right now."

"19215000","19215740"," I mean, it's set up."
"19215900","19220060"," If I was just looking at the spy chart right now, right?"
"19220800","19221580"," Like no biases."
"19222260","19223540"," Just looking at the spy chart. "

"19227460","19230320"," You got to trade down double bottom on the daily, right?"

"19272940","19274960"," There we go."
"19278960","19281880"," Probably have a bunch of family members on YouTube right now."
"19282040","19284140"," It's just watching some crap or something. "
"19289240","19290480"," I think there's a black coming."
"19292160","19293440"," I'm going to look at the implied move."
"19293560","19295920"," I'm trying to look at the implied move right now on Facebook. "
"19297380","19300980"," I'm going to pull it up here."
"19301960","19302020"," Peace."
"19302560","19303080"," Whoo!"
"19306800","19307960"," Implied move right now. "
"19309420","19310460"," Six percent."
"19313260","19314100"," Pretty big move."
"19314340","19315300"," Up or down, six percent. "
"19317280","19319120"," That's huge for Facebook."
"19329700","19333220"," Well, my noting, six of its stores are currently closed due to winter storm landing."
"19342900","19346660"," Yeah, I see the one thing about..."
"19346660","19355350"," That's a huge sale in a press interview saying that gradual rate hikes will not derail the economy. "
"19356330","19356850"," Oh."
"19357650","19359150"," Set the afternoon pump."
"19360590","19361110"," Oh. "
"19361990","19363130"," Begin the afternoon pump."
"19364310","19365150"," Begin the pump."
"19367740","19368960"," Are we getting the pump?"
"19372520","19373460"," I do, Joe. "
"19373800","19374000"," I do."
"19374480","19375500"," Are we getting the afternoon pump?"
"19376860","19377660"," Are we..."
"19377660","19378760"," Are we getting the pump?"
"19383480","19385540"," Are we getting the afternoon pump here?"
"19386040","19388160"," Is that what they're trying to do?"
"19388960","19390160"," They're trying to give the afternoon pump."
"19391480","19392580"," Did you guys hear the pump?"
"19393940","19395740"," Yeah, the best way to play any moving is always..."
"19396120","19396520"," Okay. "
"19396700","19400880"," I'm reiterating that the neat stack because it's clear inflation is too high and the labor market"
"19400880","19401380"," is strong."
"19402700","19403140"," Oh."
"19403260","19403400"," Oh. "
"19404700","19405640"," We don't like the pump."
"19406640","19409040"," Gradual rate hikes will depend on the data."
"19409960","19410300"," Oh. "
"19410960","19411760"," Perfect timing."
"19413440","19414300"," We can pump it."
"19416020","19421500"," Daily saying that she absolutely expects the policy rate to rise over the course of the year, but I"
"19421500","19427450"," am much now quickly during what meetings will be open. "
"19428010","19428210"," Oh, yeah."
"19428370","19428690"," Pump it."
"19431010","19432010"," Pump it, baby. "
"19434190","19439630"," Daily says there's no sense that their policy adjustments will derail the basic fundamentals of a"
"19439630","19441650"," strong labor market."
"19442010","19442310"," Oh, yeah."
"19442490","19442750"," Pump it. "
"19444390","19445230"," Give me that pump."
"19447150","19447930"," Pamp it, baby."
"19449390","19450330"," We have fed pump. "
"19453210","19454050"," Let's pump it."
"19454690","19455950"," We're going to pump it in a close, aren't we?"
"19457990","19459750"," The pump is always out there."
"19459950","19460270"," Here it is. "
"19460410","19461130"," You guys ready for the pump?"
"19462770","19463950"," Look at that bullshit."
"19465290","19465950"," It comes to the pump."
"19468650","19469610"," Here it comes. "
"19469790","19470170"," Pump it."
"19472330","19473410"," Can you believe it?"
"19473570","19474170"," They're going to pump it."
"19474450","19478410"," Daily saying that she feels confident they can get downward pressure on inflation. "
"19480550","19482230"," Oh, it's such a scam."
"19482910","19484010"," The rod handles."
"19484390","19491090"," Very optimistic that once it's passed they can get data and that's not as affected by Omicron. "
"19492530","19495530"," Back at growing the economy in a robust fashion."
"19497310","19499090"," The pump is in."
"19499790","19504450"," Daily says she does not see a lot of indication that the fed is behind the curve or that they"
"19504450","19507690"," have to move policy rate above the neutral rate. "
"19513240","19516560"," Daily does say she does also says she does not see evidence."
"19516840","19518380"," The labor market is overheated."
"19524900","19526020"," One final note. "
"19526300","19530780"," Daily wants you to know that she did not buy the puts on the spy."
"19535900","19540940"," A hero boomers like, what the fuck was that?"
"19543240","19543860"," Truthfully."
"19544500","19545560"," Fraud candles, baby. "
"19545740","19546320"," Here comes the fraud."
"19548300","19554760"," Here comes the fraud, baby."
"19556660","19562440"," Daily saying four or five rate hikes this year would still mean that fed policy rate would remain"
"19562440","19565220"," below a neutral level of about two and a half percent. "
"19567740","19569380"," It's been the time."
"19571670","19572530"," Pump it."
"19577450","19578590"," Perfect timing. "
"19580730","19581850"," Do you see that?"
"19582330","19582650"," Perfect timing."
"19583390","19585050"," Right when the market's supposed to sell off?"
"19586310","19586910"," The pump."
"19607830","19609970"," The fed pump just came in. "
"19612370","19613570"," It's so gross."
"19615550","19616750"," It's so gross."
"19617170","19618510"," We see this stuff. "
"19621130","19622250"," So gross."
"19623010","19632810"," Any more pump needs more"
"19632810","19633190"," pump."
"19634170","19636530"," Okay, so back to my original conversation here. "
"19638130","19642790"," I don't like seeing those spy puts coming in so soon, right?"
"19647000","19650220"," I don't like that Facebook is hedged as much as it is."
"19650840","19653000"," I don't like that Facebook can move 6%."
"19653540","19656700"," Sometimes it doesn't matter what the news is. "
"19656840","19658020"," They're going to dump it anyways."
"19662180","19666920"," Unless you pull something out of your ass like Google saying they're going to do a stock split."
"19667860","19675440"," That was a pretty big pump for the end of the day and the timing couldn't be any more succinct. "
"19676120","19677960"," It's only two o'clock in the afternoon."
"19678460","19680320"," We still have another two hours left."
"19680960","19686840"," I would think that that's going to help the market pump into clothes right now. "
"19687280","19688240"," We're going to watch it closely."
"19693890","19695510"," I do agree spies on sale."
"19696430","19701250"," I've got I'm in puts just so if anyone's asking out there, what's my positioning right now?"
"19701710","19703890"," I'm in a whole rack of spy shit. "
"19704110","19704990"," A bunch of spy."
"19706650","19707530"," That's by."
"19708730","19710350"," Oh, yeah. "
"19713960","19714260"," Look."
"19720260","19724000"," I've got a bunch of spy 442 for 40p spreads."
"19724400","19727580"," I've got a bunch of for 20. "
"19728400","19729280"," Put spreads."
"19730120","19732180"," But I bought them at 451."
"19735320","19737900"," So they don't need to go all the way down to 420. "
"19738580","19741340"," They just got a four 40 or so."
"19742060","19742880"," They're going to pretty heavy."
"19743080","19744740"," They're all dated for February 18th. "
"19745660","19749400"," We've got some piton puts, but that's not really relevant to the market per se."
"19750180","19752160"," It's more relevant to listen to that ship bag."
"19752160","19753700"," I've got run calls. "
"19757360","19759440"," But I've got no spy calls right now."
"19762260","19765880"," I'm not willing to take on spy calls unless we trade higher."
"19766240","19768320"," This wall of sellers here bothers me. "
"19771700","19772920"," I think we trade sideways."
"19773740","19775740"," I call it we trade sideways."
"19778460","19781120"," Waiting on again, waiting on Facebook. "
"19781700","19784560"," I don't know that shorts close themselves out here."
"19784920","19788520"," Unlike yesterday with Google, you know, Google's like a more of a short thing."
"19788600","19790560"," You know, Google's going to report good earnings. "
"19790860","19791180"," They should."
"19792660","19796340"," Facebook on the other hand, there might be an inside job to pin it."
"19797020","19803980"," Like they give good earnings and then they wait to let it snap up later on. "
"19805340","19806180"," Amazon's the big unknown."
"19808480","19813440"," It's maybe straight sideways into Friday and we trade higher for Amazon."
"19814020","19815560"," Bear of Amazon earnings being good. "
"19818920","19820000"," But I can be wrong on this."
"19820120","19823520"," I get these wrong sometimes so I can all pissed off at me and tell me I'm wrong."
"19824100","19825420"," I don't like these sellers above here. "
"19826740","19828320"," This is like the bear's last chance."
"19829300","19831740"," I'm a bear too, so I'll be honest with you."
"19831940","19833200"," Like this is the bear's last chance. "
"19833200","19834340"," But the bear's lose here."
"19834960","19835580"," It's all over."
"19835700","19836000"," Good night. "
"19836140","19836800"," I will tell you this."
"19837300","19838520"," If we trade above, right?"
"19838640","19843700"," If we wear these sellers out, you have to take at minimum a neutral stance."
"19845420","19847320"," And then at some point turn bullish. "
"19848300","19854880"," I'm normally among like all day long a bull, but I can get bearish whenever we need to."
"19855140","19858620"," And so I'm still bearish until we get above 460."
"19858620","19860660"," And even then I'm only neutral. "
"19862560","19863880"," But that pump just came in."
"19864000","19866460"," You see that with the Fed just did two o'clock in the afternoon."
"19868460","19870040"," Oh, yeah, Thursday and the Amazon. "
"19870040","19870540"," I apologize."
"19870820","19871760"," So one day of trading sideways."
"19872520","19874460"," Friday is kind of a nothing day. "
"19874840","19875400"," I think shit."
"19876660","19878000"," Sorry, I'm just getting my days mixed up."
"19878080","19878660"," I'm kind of tired here. "
"19879660","19880620"," I'll be honest with you."
"19880700","19881180"," I haven't been to bed."
"19882100","19883780"," I stayed awake all night long last night. "
"19883880","19887600"," I had a shit ton of money riding on calls into this morning."
"19887600","19888840"," A boatload."
"19889280","19889840"," A truckload. "
"19891420","19892560"," I had a diesel."
"19894420","19898000"," I was the one that makes that the assholes."
"19898220","19903700"," I was rolling coal all night long in my head on those calls. "
"19905800","19911060"," I'm going to be a little bit inaccurate in some of the statements that I make down to close."
"19916380","19918080"," Blah, you're back out, have it if you're daddy."
"19920180","19921120"," We could stop me. "
"19921280","19922900"," Facebook reports, great earnings."
"19923480","19925840"," They have to do something special, extra special, duper special."
"19926600","19928540"," I fear is that it's being heavily shorted. "
"19933430","19938210"," Fear is that it's like more fuck around by banks right now."
"19939090","19940670"," I don't like seeing all those puts coming in."
"19944280","19946540"," I'm seeing mixed bag on flow right now. "
"19952300","19954420"," I'm seeing calls on queues."
"19956180","19958960"," That's like $25,000, $53,000."
"19959680","19962380"," And I'm seeing $127,000 on puts on the queues. "
"19966880","19968440"," This isn't to close though."
"19968840","19969460"," This is interesting."
"19970160","19972960"," Right now, right?"
"19973380","19975600"," These are all these calls and puts are for expiry today. "
"19977520","19981560"," QQQ February 2, 368c for 50k."
"19983120","19984100"," Expires today."
"19985500","19987500"," Spy puts expiring today. "
"19988600","19991540"," February 2, 455p for $30,000."
"19991760","19992300"," Odd, right?"
"19993700","19996280"," QQQ's February 2, expiring today."
"19996980","19997700"," These are puts, right?"
"19998200","19998520"," On the queues. "
"19999800","20002440"," That goes against the queue calls expiring today."
"20003740","20004600"," $127,000."
"20005460","20006920"," QQQQ calls for today. "
"20007440","20009440"," 369c, $53,000."
"20009880","20012200"," QQQ calls for today."
"20012620","20014660"," 370c, $25,000. "
"20015680","20017740"," So this looks up more like indecision to me."
"20017820","20024180"," It doesn't look like there's a decision where we are from the bulls or bears."
"20025000","20033760"," The one cause for concern that you have to consider is that someone just loaded up with $1,200 "
"20033760","20035320",",000. "
"20038200","20039640"," $1,200,000."
"20039840","20040080"," $1,200,000."
"20041140","20041620"," $1,200,000. "
"20041620","20052490"," That was what the"
"20052490","20052950"," Fed said."
"20053270","20053850"," They give a pump."
"20054010","20054510"," I'll give them that. "
"20056190","20058970"," So I'm not in any positions that I haven't already been in."
"20059330","20060330"," I'm in some puts here."
"20060950","20063710"," I think it's too risky to take calls at this moment. "
"20064370","20068690"," I'm back to my same thesis, right?"
"20070010","20071450"," We had that move yesterday."
"20071450","20074030"," Remember we broke through the sellers yesterday."
"20074870","20076710"," We took it higher into the bell and we took it higher. "
"20078250","20080970"," I actually held them into today, right?"
"20081390","20086170"," So I'm looking for that before getting along this market, jumping in any more calls."
"20086370","20089650"," I'm not going to buy any calls unless I see these sellers be absorbed."
"20091370","20096990"," I'm already in some puts that I've been buying in the way up here looking for a consolidation or a"
"20096990","20097430"," sell-down. "
"20097430","20099810"," Not necessarily sell-downs like 410 or 420."
"20100310","20105510"," But for where we are right now, for a little bit of sideways movement, for one, two days, I guess,"
"20105730","20109470"," because we do have Amazon reporting tomorrow."
"20109890","20110870"," I think it's in a day. "
"20112210","20113730"," It makes some sense."
"20115210","20115930"," Great sideways."
"20116770","20121650"," That doesn't mean we can't trade up overnight if Facebook gives like, if Facebook's farting"
"20121650","20125930"," rainbows and, I don't know, tells you they're doing something crazy we don't know about. "
"20128950","20131290"," My general thought is that we trade sideways."
"20131810","20134570"," We haven't found the oomph yet that we're looking for."
"20136090","20137530"," Could run just shit itself. "
"20140090","20140870"," Black swans."
"20141110","20142050"," I know the bears need this."
"20142690","20145870"," The bears need a black swan, but the bears need is they need. "
"20147390","20149290"," They need Facebook to not have a good earnings."
"20150610","20152470"," They need Amazon not to have a good earnings."
"20155550","20156310"," They're only chance. "
"20157870","20159250"," Could run really just shit the bad."
"20159550","20160210"," Goddamn it, run."
"20161430","20162750"," I'm not even going to look at them. "
"20163270","20167150"," I'm just going to leave run B."
"20172820","20178460"," Now, if we did sell down here it would be, I would actually, I'd actually be green across the"
"20178460","20178680"," board."
"20184560","20186160"," And I wanted to shit the bad."
"20187300","20189120"," Yeah, I saw the new COVID string Quinn. "
"20190880","20192420"," And the bears need a fucking war."
"20199900","20200860"," I'll be serious."
"20205060","20207320"," It's a nice opportunity to be. "
"20210540","20214660"," We don't want Russia to lose face here, but we do want them to know what's up."
"20217940","20219300"," I have no love for Russia."
"20225950","20228210"," They literally reward even suffering. "
"20231120","20233620"," Well, you know, the other, the sad part is right."
"20234360","20235680"," I was telling Joe the other day."
"20235780","20237620"," I was like, I was like, you know, the sick part is. "
"20239580","20242220"," I was like, when I saw all the protesting."
"20242960","20246300"," I was like, I was like, oh man, I was like these kids keep protesting."
"20247280","20250740"," I'm like all the old white, all the old white guys are going to try to create a war. "
"20251640","20253220"," So you can get these kids off the street."
"20253580","20255380"," I was like, that's how they do this shit."
"20256480","20257680"," You got nothing better to do. "
"20257760","20259460"," We'll just create a war and send your ass to war."
"20260000","20261160"," It's so fucked up, but."
"20266300","20267860"," I love cowboy starfish. "
"20267940","20269960"," If we sell up here and be green across the board to cap."
"20270720","20271260"," I'm green."
"20271760","20272780"," I'm hella green right now. "
"20272780","20276680"," Like, across the board, I'm green, but that would be the, it would be the piece."
"20276860","20277460"," There is a stance."
"20278020","20280100"," If I trade it down, because then I'd be super green. "
"20288920","20290600"," I liked a little pump though by the fed."
"20290740","20295120"," The feds like we did it at 2 p.m. So give you time to pump it into the clothes"
"20295120","20295500"," today."
"20296500","20297180"," That's the truth. "
"20299240","20299820"," It's sick."
"20301400","20302500"," What is up with Sunrun?"
"20305520","20307920"," I probably should have checked to see how short it was."
"20308220","20309840"," How much they're short in Sunrun right now. "
"20317090","20318090"," I have to look and see."
"20318230","20320610"," I have to look and see if there's still people in the Sunrun calls."
"20320890","20322310"," Because I'm the only one standing. "
"20322890","20323750"," I'm going to get fucked."
"20326030","20326910"," This is only interest."
"20338210","20338570"," Okay. "
"20345750","20346930"," So let's look at."
"20349650","20351970"," Yeah, I've got some spike puts coming in."
"20352590","20353630"," All small money though. "
"20354430","20355630"," Nothing glaring."
"20357070","20359010"," There's some cues coming into green."
"20359310","20360610"," There's some TQQ stuff. "
"20361490","20363330"," This all looks like trader shit."
"20363690","20365510"," This doesn't look like market moving shit."
"20369720","20373960"," TQQ is 120,000 February 11th. "
"20375460","20376380"," It's not a lot."
"20377240","20379020"," TQQ February 2nd."
"20379820","20382120"," That's for today, 366 P85. "
"20382520","20386060"," This looks like we're staring into like a flat clothes almost, to be honest."
"20386640","20396550"," At this moment, if we see something different, I'll alert you guys"
"20396550","20397150"," right now."
"20398410","20418900"," It's not quite looking for"
"20418900","20421300"," something more substantial than a bunch of day traders. "
"20422860","20429460"," Looks like the stuff that's expiring today almost looks like it's just some new stuff that's not"
"20429460","20429980"," expiring today."
"20430180","20434480"," That stuff looks like a trader shit."
"20438270","20442110"," Hey, Sarah Lynn Sippity. "
"20442730","20443490"," Thank you for subscribing."
"20443490","20444270"," I appreciate it."
"20451190","20452770"," It is good to see. "
"20452770","20460350"," I do want to say to you that the sellers above are higher than they were previously."
"20461270","20466710"," They're not 457.83, 457.27. That's important to note."
"20470050","20471950"," We're starting to base out here. "
"20489500","20491120"," This is actually very bullish."
"20492540","20494460"," Believe it or not, before we are right now."
"20497240","20499820"," You're pushing the resistance higher. "
"20499820","20501920"," I don't know if you've noticed or not."
"20502360","20503760"," It was at 466."
"20504200","20508380"," We could melt up seeing this right here. "
"20512980","20514400"," Yeah, they haven't stepped in yet."
"20521600","20522180"," Hey, Mary."
"20522400","20523380"," Not much going on, brother. "
"20523580","20523920"," Same bullshit."
"20524660","20524860"," Sideways."
"20526440","20527720"," Nothing is going on. "
"20528820","20533880"," We've moved up the resistance a little bit."
"20533880","20544980"," We're at 457.15. Lots"
"20544980","20545700"," of negative flow."
"20550380","20551200"," Same sellers. "
"20551400","20551700"," Look at this."
"20551940","20552280"," Isn't that crazy?"
"20554640","20557140"," Black skies above, black, blue skies below."
"20563300","20564640"," What does this look like to me?"
"20565080","20565620"," Wearing out sellers. "
"20566180","20566400"," That's it."
"20568960","20570640"," So you're wearing out sellers here."
"20571160","20573200"," And if any bad news comes in, we're going to drop. "
"20574020","20576880"," If any good news comes in, we're going to break through."
"20578000","20581020"," I would think that into the close."
"20585920","20590540"," I wonder if we'll look above if cash market can't do it. "
"20591940","20593200"," Just have a look above."
"20594660","20597100"," Need to have that look above before we sell the market."
"20600080","20601260"," I mean, just look at that. "
"20606120","20610000"," Remember that the smart money is down below 5453, and they're all day long."
"20610800","20612380"," Steady supply of sellers above."
"20612900","20614540"," We expected that from this morning. "
"20614760","20616680"," This morning's video we talked about this, right?"
"20617420","20618580"," Nothing's really changed today."
"20623480","20624240"," That's what I think, Mary."
"20624460","20625500"," I think it ends sideways. "
"20625940","20630040"," I think it ends sideways today, waiting on Facebook and then for Amazon."
"20630680","20632200"," I think Facebook's being shorted."
"20633540","20634300"," That's what I think. "
"20634300","20637740"," I think they're not going to allow Facebook to move the market too much."
"20637740","20639440"," I think they're waiting on Amazon now."
"20639720","20640880"," It's like Google and Amazon. "
"20643920","20645640"," Am I going to be long for the PAMP?"
"20645860","20645980"," Nope."
"20646720","20647940"," I think it's sideways in the close."
"20648280","20650520"," I think we trade sideways and down into the Amazon earnings. "
"20651420","20657020"," And then we are going to have Amazon to decide our fate if we trade higher or not."
"20660760","20661920"," So I won't trade this."
"20661920","20665060"," And I'm shorted the market right now if everybody wants to know. "
"20673090","20677550"," Yeah, I'm bullish on if Amazon reports well."
"20679050","20682070"," I'm watching some Facebook puts come in right now."
"20682790","20684730"," February 4th, 310P. "
"20686570","20688250"," $477,000."
"20689210","20694830"," Facebook puts February 4th again, 310P, $190,000."
"20701120","20701860"," That's good. "
"20701980","20702820"," Good question."
"20703300","20705800"," My overall thesis remains the same."
"20705960","20706460"," Nothing's changed. "
"20707280","20709400"," I think we I thought we we we traded down a 420."
"20709900","20715240"," I think we trade down once more until we change some and that's still something changes."
"20715800","20721960"," I talked about it this morning until something changes where we trade higher and above this major"
"20721960","20725200"," resistance channel and we consolidate and move higher. "
"20726520","20728480"," I think we have to do a retest down below."
"20730360","20735220"," I don't know if that comes now February 18th or March 18th."
"20735280","20736760"," I think it'll be one more retest. "
"20739440","20743660"," I think that the volatility is there for the first rate hike."
"20746400","20748220"," It's going to be stupid when it happens too."
"20748360","20749580"," You know, I can be like, why is this happening?"
"20749920","20750840"," I think it still happens. "
"20750840","20755240"," I think we then make a nice move after the March bullshit."
"20756600","20761340"," We probably trade down again in the summertime and then trade down again in the fall."
"20761740","20762740"," We trade up each time. "
"20763240","20772240"," They have a great holiday rally into December and we close the year out slightly positive."
"20772400","20772560"," Let's see."
"20772640","20776040"," We're up 9% 15% just like the banks say somewhere in there. "
"20778060","20782900"," I think it's a bad year overall, but I think they have to get it low enough a couple of"
"20782900","20785440"," times to make the money like they would if it was a good year."
"20785720","20786820"," That's the weird part about the market."
"20787920","20791220"," So if they get stopped on the wrist and they get told, well, you have to have a bad year"
"20791220","20794500"," for our flat year, they'll still make shit tons of money. "
"20794500","20798640"," They just have to make it low enough so they can go high enough two, three times to make it"
"20798640","20801700"," seem like they weren't making tons of money."
"20802760","20803800"," Take one way or another."
"20803820","20804640"," They're going to make their money. "
"20805040","20807940"," Are they going to make their money on us blasting through to like 600?"
"20809280","20810140"," Or are they going to make it?"
"20810140","20812640"," We're coming up to the close of pitch rating and energy markets for the day."
"20812800","20816060"," WTI crude futures at 86 17."
"20816460","20817660"," A little changed on the day. "
"20818740","20820740"," The 88 17 little changed on the day."
"20824440","20828220"," This follows the OPEC plus meeting earlier today where they did follow through and indicate they're"
"20828220","20830460"," going to raise output by another 400,000 barrels in March."
"20835220","20836720"," So it was 400,000. "
"20838880","20840080"," Well, it's flat of the day."
"20840160","20843160"," But then to limited the EDL in India, reportedly."
"20846010","20850610"," Agarwal is said to be weighing a Van Dandamer, Van Detta merger with India arm. "
"20854160","20864920"," Draco Delta Lima is the US ADR. That's"
"20864920","20869420"," probably the short and tomorrow to, by the way, there was a short and tomorrow."
"20869640","20870280"," It's probably energy. "
"20870280","20875380"," The report goes on to say, Agarwal's deliberations are ongoing and may or may not lead to a deal."
"20878280","20879460"," Want a short sum tomorrow?"
"20879980","20883180"," Sort like ZOM or XOP, USO."
"20885460","20889180"," Immersion consulting is achieving Fed ramp of authorization. "
"20890360","20891160"," India, Michael, Michael, Romeo."
"20897820","20898780"," Wait until the close."
"20899300","20900840"," Grab some shorts on one of those. "
"20901080","20901900"," Well, yeah, don't do it."
"20902580","20903420"," Don't follow what I say."
"20904500","20908240"," I think the short is in energy tomorrow. "
"20914530","20915410"," Yeah, sure."
"20920060","20920920"," Yep, still sellers."
"20936950","20938850"," Watching QQQ's positive flow. "
"20939330","20940070"," A little bit of negative."
"20941910","20943510"," QQQ February 2nd."
"20943610","20944130"," That's for today. "
"20945530","20946310"," 366C 154."
"20946670","20948730"," Boy, it seems like they want to park it, doesn't it?"
"20949710","20950990"," It's all looks like parking flow."
"20953560","20957980"," $154,366C February 2nd. "
"20958640","20960740"," TQQ February 4th."
"20961020","20961220"," That's good."
"20962040","20964000"," 64C, $139,000. "
"20964280","20966660"," It's got a pretty decent flow score."
"20967420","20969860"," TQQ February 2nd."
"20970600","20970960"," That's for today. "
"20971500","20974360"," 366C, $166,000."
"20975120","20976680"," Wait, let this load up."
"20978080","20979440"," Look on the queues. "
"20980080","20983620"," It's by February 4th."
"20984260","20986340"," 460C, $62,000."
"20986820","20988200"," It's a big ass pull out there. "
"20989320","20990140"," It's a big ass retilble."
"20990960","20992820"," QQQQ February 2nd for today."
"20993740","20994680"," $146,000 P."
"20998790","21000450"," And then spy calls for today. "
"21000650","21004130"," 456 P.C. This all looks like a pennant."
"21005190","21008170"," It's sellers waiting above a 3753 on the queues."
"21009890","21014780"," It's the same situation as the spy. "
"21015460","21016100"," No difference."
"21017180","21022860"," It shouldn't be the same buyers below."
"21023420","21025320"," More buyers are 340 and 360. "
"21026320","21027580"," Not a lot of support in here."
"21030060","21036080"," Any kind of bad bad ER is not going to be good for the queues."
"21040960","21042900"," 390, sky until 390. "
"21044020","21045340"," Heavy hedging on the queues."
"21045660","21046500"," Heavy hedging on the spy."
"21048160","21049140"," Which is expected. "
"21050400","21054960"," You can bring up the heroin decanter."
"21055080","21055500"," Let it load up."
"21056060","21056480"," There we go. "
"21060880","21062020"," It's tough right now."
"21062980","21064960"," TQQ has a call for tomorrow."
"21069440","21070980"," I'm going to say sideways and down. "
"21071540","21071980"," That's what I think."
"21075650","21079790"," The only thing I can't put into that is unknown Facebook earnings."
"21079790","21081290"," And you can't call that. "
"21083050","21089010"," If you wanted to trade Facebook earnings, is there earnings right at 4 p.m.? Because you can"
"21089010","21091430"," probably take a day trade after the bell on that."
"21091610","21094270"," On those earnings, bring up the queues and you're a broker."
"21096390","21099290"," And you can look for a quick dip or a quick rip. "
"21103540","21105020"," Pretenders the ER release."
"21116560","21124420"," It's at 5 p.m. And that sucks."
"21124940","21136110"," I still don't"
"21136110","21137910"," like the..."
"21138850","21139610"," Let's see. "
"21174920","21179140"," So the ER is out of 4.15, but they're at 5 p.m. Is there guidance?"
"21180880","21182960"," I guess we're going to have a future settling at 80."
"21183200","21184160"," It's about 26 in parallel."
"21185060","21186820"," Up about 1.10 to 1%. "
"21191810","21192930"," Yeah, this is a burn day."
"21193990","21195070"," I agree with that statement."
"21209840","21211000"," Sideways and down, baby. "
"21218590","21220850"," Burn off some more of these sellers here."
"21227580","21228580"," Just straight burn."
"21234160","21235080"," You can see it here. "
"21235160","21236440"," All these sellers above."
"21238340","21239380"," Just keep showing up."
"21242680","21246760"," These are all these long hedge funds they told you that they bought Netflix. "
"21247560","21248800"," People at the Netflix bottom."
"21249000","21251560"," In reality, they were upside down in Netflix."
"21253760","21256500"," They wanted to trade the market up so they could un-fuck themselves. "
"21263500","21264440"," Yeah, I've been taking a trade."
"21264560","21265480"," I closed the trade this morning."
"21265480","21266920"," I've been waiting for a trade all day long. "
"21267000","21267980"," I haven't seen one."
"21269120","21270660"," I'm not willing to give my money back."
"21271300","21272360"," I traded a run. "
"21273140","21273700"," Still sitting."
"21273880","21274900"," No, I picked up a run today."
"21275020","21275840"," I'm still sitting in that. "
"21276080","21277420"," I missed the MG trade."
"21281200","21286880"," And I've got Peton and some spy puts and some run calls."
"21294880","21302280"," Now, runs ER is 9 to the 17, but Ford's is, I believe, tomorrow. "
"21308310","21309750"," It was with run."
"21310850","21312070"," Get your ass moving."

"21352940","21359580"," Spy or SPX February 2nd, 4600 C, $74,000."
"21359580","21362880"," That's the second SPX calls I've seen today."
"21363820","21365140"," I haven't seen any SPX puts. "
"21365960","21368220"," I always like seeing those."
"21381760","21387060"," Couple sets of calls on SPX 4600 C for just today."
"21387780","21389220"," This is more like a pinning to me. "
"21389700","21391380"," You get SPX calls today, right?"
"21391860","21396820"," February 2nd, 4600 C, $74,000 at 2.35 PM."
"21397500","21400400"," Then you've got 4580 calls."
"21400420","21401740"," Those are dated for today. "
"21402680","21405960"," That's 1258 PM for $500,000."
"21418010","21419550"," Somebody accidentally hit the buy button."
"21429310","21431790"," It's almost kind of the same setup as yesterday, right?"
"21432450","21433650"," They pin it into the clothes. "
"21434970","21436490"," Hold it here for Facebook."
"21438230","21440570"," It's almost like you're on the."
"21444240","21446260"," You're on the guillotine every day. "
"21446620","21448180"," Yesterday you're on the guillotine with Google."
"21448900","21450440"," Today you're on the guillotine with Facebook."
"21451360","21453800"," And then tomorrow you're on the guillotine for Amazon. "
"21455720","21457700"," Just waiting for an excuse to sell it."
"21459200","21459900"," Just waiting."
"21470440","21474820"," Yeah, you know, if it came out right at 2 o'clock, turn on the buy program, the PAMP. "
"21477300","21478500"," Everybody remain calm."
"21479300","21480440"," Yeah, there's still sellers."
"21481480","21483280"," OK, so I'm going to leave you guys. "
"21483560","21484420"," I'm going to stay here with you."

"21496760","21498100"," The newscaster guy."
"21500940","21503020"," There's heavy sellers here."
"21504440","21506120"," Doesn't mean like we're selling the market. "
"21506120","21508720"," It means that trying to wear out trapped."
"21509920","21511120"," Dude, I'm telling you."
"21511920","21515680"," There are people that were when we sold it for 50. "
"21517020","21517500"," They."
"21518980","21520540"," Oh, yeah, right now I'm Brian T."
"21520880","21521700"," Thanks for subscribing brother."
"21522380","21526840"," When we sold this market, they diamond handed. "
"21527860","21531060"," And once we traded back up here, they said F that amount of here."
"21531880","21532520"," Let me out."
"21541620","21542640"," I'm sticking with run. "
"21543540","21544380"," I'm good with run."
"21547770","21548850"," I'll ride that one out."
"21548930","21549770"," I'll ride Pete on out. "
"21550170","21551150"," They were dirt cheap too."
"21552890","21554470"," Like 600 bucks or something."
"21555410","21557610"," You have like 100 of them or some stupid like that. "
"21558710","21559730"," They cost me nothing."
"21563180","21566440"," They're going to pump and Q plus ES Vix is puking."
"21567460","21568220"," I don't know. "
"21569620","21571000"," No, I don't know."
"21571000","21573480"," You know what a mirror looks like right now."
"21575620","21580200"," It looks like it's the same pin as yesterday, but I don't think shorts are scared. "
"21581080","21584600"," Head of the sneak and suspicion that they're shorting Facebook so much that it ain't going to"
"21584600","21584840"," matter."
"21588100","21590920"," Unless I'm like, unless Facebook does something magical."
"21593740","21597380"," In their ER, it's going to be flat by open tomorrow. "
"21598920","21600600"," Just keep grinding, grinding."
"21601020","21603380"," There is a set up here for down."
"21605280","21606320"," It's like the guillotine. "
"21606440","21607720"," It's like swear yesterday."
"21608980","21609620"," Same shit."
"21610160","21610460"," Drag it up. "
"21612660","21613600"," Hey, I got options."
"21613940","21614640"," Thanks for the tip, brother."
"21615140","21615660"," Appreciate it. "
"21618740","21620040"," You like the pin it up here?"
"21622340","21626860"," And they're waiting for one of these companies to report bad."
"21626860","21631580"," The scary part is let's say Facebook has good earnings."
"21633740","21635560"," And let's say Amazon has good earnings. "
"21637760","21640020"," And now you're done with all the big tech, right?"
"21641020","21644220"," Is that the cutting block, the chopping block to the market?"
"21650050","21651670"," The expectations, they pin it up."
"21651890","21654690"," They wait for earnings and they're going to sell out or rip it again."
"21656270","21660210"," But I don't think we get away with it twice. "
"21675360","21677360"," You guys want a price target for above?"
"21677980","21678360"," 460."
"21679460","21680460"," That's the price target."
"21681180","21681840"," All day long. "
"21683040","21683280"," Right here."
"21695490","21698450"," I will let you know that we definitely have a buy program on."
"21700270","21703410"," Because we were way low on buyers. "
"21703410","21710370"," We're now closing in on equal buyers and sellers on the spy currently."
"21712370","21714310"," The conscience of that."
"21718130","21719410"," Price target, 460. "
"21721130","21769000"," If we"
"21769000","21772980"," had like three banging earnings, Facebook just nailed it."
"21773160","21776500"," And then Amazon just nailed it."
"21776500","21785380"," The 6% implied move on Facebook. "
"21786560","21787700"," That's insane."
"21799080","21800220"," It's actually gone up now."
"21800300","21802880"," It's 6.5% implied move on Facebook. "
"21810630","21811480"," Well, it's not too much."
"21811700","21815160"," The move is implied to be from current where we are currently."
"21816240","21834070"," To 343.96. For as low as 301.86. The 301 "
"21834070","21836150",".86 would put us back to 420. "
"21838510","21840370"," It's pretty big moves right there."
"21844400","21846480"," And that's by Friday."
"21847160","21852420"," 6.5% implied move for Facebook. "
"21853460","21854200"," It's insane."
"21869420","21874820"," What's the first thing that I think of here?"
"21875320","21876380"," I can't call it here."
"21876380","21877600"," Too risky. "
"21880240","21880740"," Straddle."
"21885250","21887190"," Puts out to the 18th in the money."
"21892010","21895150"," And some outside the money calls for Friday. "
"21902800","21905200"," Or just inside the money calls for Friday would work too."
"21906180","21907540"," Inside the money calls for Friday."
"21908980","21909300"," On the spy. "
"21910120","21916680"," And then some in the money puts or outside the money puts on the spy for February 18th."
"21916680","21917940"," Not quite a straddle."
"21947770","21951370"," My guess is that we trade down in sideways into Thursday for Amazon. "
"21952350","21953930"," My fear is that it's setting up."
"21954990","21955950"," Sell the news."
"21966480","21968080"," The premium is used. "
"21970120","21971960"," I love how I love strangles."
"21972380","21980150"," I don't like the implied move on Facebook."
"21982810","21984030"," I just don't. "
"21984570","21985790"," It's a huge move."
"21986490","21988570"," 6.5% for Facebook."
"21991490","22005570"," Right back"
"22005570","22006870"," in 15 minutes for 3 o'clock. "
"22007630","22008410"," Leave this on for you."
"22556190","22556670"," Workhorse."
"22556830","22556970"," WP. "
"22557430","22560390"," She has to take a little bit higher on this report."
"22610480","22611220"," All right."
"22614870","22615450"," Here I come. "
"22615610","22615830"," I'm back."
"22625610","22625870"," Yeah."
"22625970","22627350"," So it looks like the same setup as yesterday. "
"22627590","22628350"," Pin it up into the clothes."
"22628710","22632010"," Try to reach above the 460 or as close as we can get to it."
"22632310","22634550"," Even though we're topping off real quick right now. "
"22635830","22641030"," We've got sellers above at 457 or 58 or so."
"22641850","22643270"," I started still 460."
"22644050","22648390"," We have traded this high to not trade up to 460 into the bell. "
"22650470","22652770"," Or at least trade sideways even into clothes."
"22653110","22654890"," Either way, it's still kind of pinned here."
"22655330","22656550"," Doesn't matter if we stay here. "
"22656710","22662270"," Let's say we stay at 457.72 or we trade up into 460 into the bell."
"22663250","22664110"," It's the same thing."
"22664430","22666410"," While I'm watching lots of calls come in right now. "
"22666490","22668170"," The bulls have to step up here."
"22668170","22671310"," We have to show the resolve for where we are at."
"22671650","22675690"," We're at veritably at 460 right now. "
"22675830","22678970"," We're close enough for the ranges that we trade in."
"22680030","22682810"," We should have seen a volatility get killed today."
"22683270","22688510"," That was a note in the spot gamma released this morning as well that we should see volatility get"
"22688510","22688810"," killed. "
"22689230","22692870"," We did see some extra hedging though come in on the spy today."
"22693310","22695530"," That was not there prior to today."
"22695530","22703510"," I'm going to say, based upon us heading into the Facebook earnings this afternoon, there is, I do"
"22703510","22707410"," have an issue with what's going on right now there where it's like you're being put on the plank"
"22707410","22711870"," every day, you're walking the plank now in the spy yesterday, they made you walk the plank on the"
"22711870","22713910"," spy for Google earnings. "
"22715030","22722210"," We saw Google not only have kick ass earnings, but we also saw the Google offer a 20 to one"
"22722210","22723550"," stock split this summer."
"22724330","22728430"," And what did it take for Google to smash earnings was that stock split."
"22728790","22732130"," So they are looking for something like that into this earnings. "
"22732570","22739210"," And even with that earnings stock split, Google traded back down today to 29, 11, they did recover"
"22739210","22745530"," today, bouncing off their, their simple moving average, that nice white 200 a simple moving average"
"22745530","22751130"," on the five minute at least, so they did bounce off that again to remain bullish."
"22751390","22757930"," But even with that said, right, even with a 20 to a 21 stock split, you can tell that the"
"22757930","22760550"," markets looking for a reason to sell right now."
"22762110","22767070"," So every day right now we've got, we've got two more days left, right, we've got the end of today. "
"22767350","22773430"," And then we've got Thursday for big tech, who generally speaking have done their earnings cycle."
"22773630","22778050"," That is important to note, so you have Facebook with great earnings."
"22778050","22780330"," Then you have Amazon with great earnings. "
"22780330","22781230"," Let's just say, right?"
"22781410","22782290"," We have great two great earnings."
"22783670","22786750"," The question becomes this, the spy trade up from there."
"22787890","22792250"," And so we're being forced to walk a plank every day right now on the market. "
"22793150","22800650"," We are at an inflection point in the market where we can seriously trade down here, where there can"
"22800650","22805170"," be rejection, a major rejection on the S&P 500 on the spy."
"22805170","22810190"," Then you have to ask the question, what do you have to look forward to after Amazon earnings for"
"22810190","22810410"," spy?"
"22811090","22815630"," So let's say we have Facebook is good, not great, but not bad."
"22816290","22818030"," Okay, so we pin the market up again. "
"22818550","22827430"," And then we look at Amazon on Thursday, and then that doesn't even focus on other tickers or mid"
"22827430","22830750"," and small caps or some of the large caps that are left, which we still have a ton."
"22831270","22833270"," But the majors are pretty much done."
"22834630","22838410"," So that becomes the question is, what happens after that?"
"22838530","22842870"," Do we trade higher, does, you know, like the shiny rock, right?"
"22843230","22844530"," We're like kids at a candy store, right?"
"22844610","22845730"," We're looking for the next shiny rock. "
"22846250","22854690"," So do we do we start to focus elsewhere in the market and not directly on these, on the Fangman"
"22854690","22857110"," plus T kind of stocks, right?"
"22857410","22861890"," We're still going to focus on Nvidia, so we're going to focus on snow, all these other countries,"
"22861890","22862790"," big ones, right?"
"22863010","22863450"," Shopify."
"22864350","22865510"," They're holding up the market."
"22865710","22868670"," But generally speaking, the Fangman plus T stocks are done. "
"22869630","22870510"," Veritably they're done."
"22878270","22878710"," Yeah."
"22879390","22880730"," Jay Powell, hiking rights, baby. "
"22880750","22881710"," That's what we're looking forward to."
"22881870","22886470"," And that is the reality of the situation is you really want to start to, let me look at you"
"22886470","22887030"," guys real quick."
"22887510","22889450"," You really started to look at the truth, right?"
"22889750","22895570"," And the truth is we're looking for those companies to see what they report their earnings. "
"22896130","22897750"," And then you start to think down the road."
"22897950","22898850"," What else are we looking for?"
"22899390","22902750"," How long does the market hold up until it starts to roll over once more?"
"22903210","22908050"," Or we get some good news, look forward to the rest of earnings season."
"22910160","22911580"," So that's a big question. "
"22912120","22914820"," So for myself, I'm not going to take some calls in the close today."
"22915200","22916340"," I'm sitting on some puts."
"22916640","22918700"," I think we trade sideways and down. "
"22919240","22921240"," We can get a pump from Facebook earnings."
"22921520","22923060"," We can get a pump from Amazon earnings."
"22923420","22931560"," If Amazon did announce a stock split, maybe they're in cohort or concert with Google, they got that"
"22931560","22934160"," sympathy play though in the overnight last night. "
"22934720","22936600"," I don't know that they're actually going to do that."
"22937500","22945140"," I have concerns with Amazon not being able to produce in their guidance what they produced in 2020"
"22945140","22945880"," and 2021."
"22947060","22951700"," Though if they were to raise their, if they were to announce at some point that they're raising"
"22951700","22955740"," their price of Amazon Prime, that would help. "
"22956020","22958900"," I don't like the pre, I don't like when they pre-pump it."
"22959040","22963480"," I like when they do it right in their ER during their guidance to make a mention of that."
"22963660","22967720"," But other than that, I need to see what we're looking forward to for news. "
"22970390","22971730"," Yeah, I don't think they do a split either."
"22972930","22974510"," But if they did, you never know."
"22978110","22979570"," So I mean, I have questions on that stuff. "
"22979710","22980610"," I really want to know from you guys."
"22980610","22983110"," What do we have to look forward to?"
"22984670","22986370"," What do we have to look forward to?"
"22987430","22989030"," Once Fangman plus tier done."
"22997000","22998340"," I'm interested to know. "
"22999160","23005380"," Candidates, Mackle, I'm saying that the U.S.C. is committed to returning inflation to target as"
"23007850","23009850"," Canada rates will need to rise."
"23015590","23019990"," Mackle, I'm saying that there's some uncertainty about how quickly inflation will come down in"
"23019990","23020390"," Canada."
"23039430","23039990"," Yeah. "
"23040710","23041030"," Yeah."
"23041110","23041750"," So that's going to be my take."
"23041750","23045150"," My take is that I'm looking to see what you guys are reading here. "
"23046150","23048250"," I don't think that matters against the Fed."
"23048970","23052790"," Yeah, I agree with that statement to an extent to if we trade down too low, that we'll see a"
"23052790","23053230"," trade down."
"23054250","23056130"," They'll pick it back up, the Fed put, right?"
"23058390","23058930"," All right. "
"23059170","23059970"," So we're at three o'clock."
"23060590","23063630"," My take would be that we pin the market into the close."
"23063890","23070230"," We could trade up on some on some positive bull flow from this point forward and for some short"
"23070230","23070590"," covering. "
"23070590","23074570"," I would expect some short covering into the close over Facebook earnings because you don't ever"
"23074570","23075670"," know what they're going to report."
"23076350","23082190"," So I say we trade up to 460 into the bell and then we pin it and then we wait"
"23082190","23083070"," Facebook."
"23083350","23088430"," The one morning I have for you is that it's like walking a plank every day right now. "
"23088550","23093870"," Every day we're walking a plank just waiting for one batter to make an excuse to sell the market."
"23094390","23102680"," So just be a conscience of that as we trade into the close today at 3 p.m. and it"
"23102680","23104320"," has inflation, they don't have belly buttons."
"23106380","23110700"," We are wearing outsellers here, but I think what this is going to turn into is more of a short"
"23110700","23113880"," covering rally, which is different than wearing outsellers. "
"23114180","23115820"," I think they're still here right now."
"23116200","23117180"," I don't think they're going anywhere."
"23117300","23118700"," I think we're only going to warn them out yet. "
"23120520","23122580"," We do have some volume increasing here."
"23123160","23126200"," We had price targets for 60 at the bell."
"23126400","23127260"," Hopefully we can get there. "
"23127900","23128700"," Not positive on them."
"23128720","23129100"," We get there."
"23130120","23131860"," But I'd like to see us have that look above. "
"23132320","23136760"," It would be if you're a bull, the reason I was asking the question about are you looking for good"
"23136760","23138200"," news to not sell the market is?"
"23138400","23140040"," I think we've made it all the way up here."
"23140100","23142780"," You want to see 460 so you can take that peak above."
"23143300","23150820"," If Facebook has kick ass earnings, we can trade above the 460 and trade sideways into Amazon"
"23150820","23151320"," earnings. "
"23152240","23156500"," Then you would just from the charts I showed you this morning, you would see us trade sideways and"
"23156500","23160800"," down after a great Facebook earnings, and then you'd see Amazon lift the entire market up."
"23161280","23163820"," We'd break out of the bear channel."
"23165780","23167340"," I think that's where it is. "
"23167980","23169200"," But I think of the downside."
"23169640","23173080"," If you get a Facebook negative earnings or an Amazon negative earnings, I think we're going to see"
"23173080","23174260"," some much lower numbers."
"23174900","23179480"," I think you're going to wind up seeing a retest of that 420 possibly even deeper. "
"23187060","23193200"," We were saying Elbrook's thinks that we get one to three weeks up trading after most recent low."
"23194000","23196300"," Then we get a second leg sideways to down."
"23196300","23199920"," I agree with the sentiment at this point, taking or taking is logic. "
"23200460","23201620"," So explain that over time."
"23202160","23205880"," We have one to three weeks up trading after the most recent low."
"23207840","23210920"," Is this like a three or five or three three three pattern?"
"23211140","23211860"," Is he talking about here?"
"23217250","23219070"," Like a one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. "
"23228040","23240260"," Emerson one,"
"23240520","23244480"," two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three."
"23247330","23249370"," Yeah, I think we do the sideways pattern."
"23256650","23259890"," Are you talking about a lot on a larger time frame?"
"23261950","23265210"," I did see one guy talking about like a downward crab or something. "
"23265370","23268550"," We try to stay range bound for a couple of months from here."
"23271010","23279670"," But we are on if you look on a on ES right now, they can post this somewhere for you."
"23279690","23280990"," If you look on the ES chart. "
"23283410","23285170"," We are at a rejection point."
"23285670","23286610"," There's no doubt about it."
"23287190","23288730"," So we either have to trade over. "
"23288930","23290050"," This is a do or die."
"23290090","23292970"," You either have to trade over the 460 to trade sideways."
"23294830","23297970"," So let me take a look at an ES right now and just see if we've traded over the. "
"23298790","23303230"," We need to trade as we met, we might have, but we need to trade over today."
"23303550","23308050"," Even if we trade sideways, we can't be rejected here."
"23308810","23310950"," If this is the bears do or die. "
"23312770","23316270"," And we're right on it literally to the pin right now at this moment."
"23316910","23318790"," We're sitting on it on the pen."
"23320830","23322370"," Into this close right now. "
"23326970","23327830"," To the pin."
"23329110","23330970"," Matter of fact, we just rejected off it."
"23332530","23334470"," We just to the pin rejected off it. "
"23334510","23339110"," I'll take two, I'll take two two snaps of it."
"23339190","23339970"," This is from this morning."
"23342010","23343770"," Take two and post it to. "
"23351790","23353370"," Posting the rejection right now."
"23362520","23364380"," We're right off the point six, one, eight."
"23370530","23372750"," I think to me, this is more of a setup. "
"23373030","23375550"," It's not we will or we can't."
"23375570","23378270"," I think there's three different possibilities."
"23379290","23379950"," Possible outcomes. "
"23380310","23381590"," The sideways trade is one of them."
"23382990","23384750"," The rejection is one of them."
"23385810","23388250"," And then actually the bullshit above is one of them. "
"23388290","23389310"," I think there's three valid."
"23390730","23392290"," Let's just say it's three valid."
"23394270","23396670"," A possibility is for how we trade right now. "
"23397310","23401310"," I don't know if you're tuning in this morning, but I was trying to give all three options."
"23402010","23404810"," And this is the thing that I talk about when it comes to."
"23406450","23407450"," The randomness of a."
"23407770","23412690"," Well, let's keep noting that COVID cases are down by about 36 percent of the prior week. "
"23413190","23414970"," Oh, probably it's rough about four percent."
"23419040","23421540"," So I don't necessarily remember it necessarily."
"23421540","23424820"," Well, I'm still from a bearish perspective because I haven't broken above yet. "
"23425120","23428480"," But I just posted it on Twitter on at Captain's Alpha real quick."
"23429140","23433840"," And we just we did just reject off of this level that we need to break above."
"23434020","23437240"," It's critical that if you're a bull that we break above there. "
"23438100","23442120"," So we can trade sideways, consolidate to trade higher."
"23444720","23453380"," If we fail to do that with Facebook today and if Amazon were to fail, you would see the same"
"23453380","23453640"," thing."
"23453820","23454840"," You would see a hard rejection. "
"23455680","23459260"," We should retest lows even lower than 420 this time."
"23459940","23461000"," So it is important."
"23461340","23463780"," These er statements are going to be important to the market. "
"23470980","23473620"," We still have unknown news with Ukraine as well."
"23474020","23477160"," Though we do and don't know the news on a new crane."
"23477660","23479320"," So there are some unknown things. "
"23479680","23485280"," I think it's critical right now that Facebook does report great earnings."
"23485280","23488320"," I think it's critical that Amazon reports great earnings as well."
"23490420","23491980"," This stuff matches up perfect. "
"23492260","23492300"," Right."
"23492420","23496740"," You look at the retracement to 0.618 retracement on the spy right now."
"23496760","23499440"," It's literally to the pin into this close today. "
"23500700","23502120"," Same thing happened yesterday."
"23502920","23507500"," We're at the 50% retracement right right into the last 15 minutes of closer."
"23507500","23509640"," So we traded higher. "
"23510120","23511680"," I would expect the same today."
"23512240","23516100"," It's important that we trade higher the 460 on this bell."
"23521690","23522230"," Critical. "
"23531950","23533230"," Yeah, it could be really shitty."
"23536740","23543940"," It could be it could be really, really shitty on on the market into February and March."
"23544220","23551320"," I did notice that there's more puts hedging into March in some repositioning of puts on February"
"23551320","23551920"," 18th. "
"23552000","23554660"," They were they were much deeper for February 18th."
"23554700","23557140"," And now they've raised up their puts for the 18th."
"23558080","23561400"," March looks like is the new target for high volatility. "
"23565440","23569940"," OK, so I'm going to look at the 20 day for our candle."
"23570240","23575660"," And I asked, yeah, I know, but I thought I'd looked at the four hour with 20 day and the"
"23575660","23576400"," fifth 40 day."
"23581750","23583210"," Yeah, I can see the 21 up here. "
"23588960","23590620"," Yeah, I see that I see that basing."
"23594120","23595140"," I see that basing."
"23601390","23603170"," I think we traded in the four six in the clothes. "
"23603170","23604350"," I think we pin it into the clothes."
"23604830","23606710"," It's critical that it's pinned."
"23606750","23611970"," It's critical that we look above and that it's critical that Facebook reports good earnings. "
"23612650","23616090"," I think we then are we can maintain that we're above the sellers."
"23616790","23618150"," Futures can work on that."
"23618670","23622190"," And then we trade sideways waiting for Amazon to make us trade higher. "
"23625400","23628060"," But outside of that, it won't trade higher off of it."
"23628160","23629560"," Won't trade higher off of just because."
"23632620","23636120"," That's that's the issue is you need to have news. "
"23636440","23637920"," You need to have something positive."
"23653720","23654780"," No, I won't get put."
"23654940","23658060"," I've got protective puts that I've been putting on the whole well. "
"23658520","23660320"," I've been able to get puts to print."
"23661140","23663740"," I took puts a couple times when we're trading sideways."
"23664440","23669820"," And then I grabbed my next set of puts at where we're at when we're at 44442. "
"23670540","23675600"," I grabbed some put spreads and then we when we were at 44442, we were above at 451."
"23676540","23681000"," I bought more puts, but I bought them farther outside of the money."
"23681140","23684820"," I bought them at 420 to 425. "
"23686200","23689700"," So they and they print big and a bunch of banks run on those two."
"23689840","23693940"," So more and mostly protective, not a bearish."
"23694560","23696560"," And I've been trading long all the way up here. "
"23699420","23700820"," So I'm bullish."
"23700820","23706540"," I don't want to think that I have a bullish or that I'm that I'm a bearish context in today"
"23706540","23708020"," where we are today."
"23708420","23710480"," I'm bullish on the daily today. "
"23711780","23712940"," It has to happen."
"23713400","23715000"," Now, it's kind of like a do or die thing."
"23715000","23718240"," The longer that you sit here, did look around, right?"
"23718380","23721420"," Going sideways, we start adding one, two, three days on sideways. "
"23722060","23722880"," We know what happens."
"23723080","23725840"," We can we can show it again and again and again and again."
"23726340","23731400"," Over time that if we if we start to trade sideways over two, three days, we trade down. "
"23731580","23735480"," We look for where support actually is if you can't trade higher."
"23739410","23744250"," On the grinder scale, if we trade into like a range from here for the next few months, that doesn't"
"23744250","23745550"," sound unreasonable to me."
"23746970","23752070"," But you're looking for certain catalysts here. "
"23752690","23755350"," It's not a good look at Facebook, doesn't print a good earnings."
"23755850","23758430"," It's not a good look if Amazon doesn't have a great earnings."
"23759150","23766050"," You don't have a lot to look forward to into OPEC's and then, of course, March, a threat of rate"
"23766050","23766290"," heights. "
"23776150","23777570"," Revenge of the VIX is looming."
"23778210","23779410"," Yeah, that's the other thing, too."
"23779670","23781550"," Like, there's a bunch of different mechanics going on here. "
"23781650","23785170"," You got like you got you got bears last stand here."
"23785590","23787430"," You've got believe it or not."
"23787490","23791350"," I know you're not going to believe this, but there are bulls that are hiding out there that just"
"23791350","23794590"," want to sell right when they come up when we come up around here. "
"23794810","23798650"," You know that the runway runs out for bulls to once Amazon reports."
"23798750","23800910"," If they can't get out, then think about it."
"23800910","23806010"," If you got caught in your and you let's say you got caught above the Bank of Canada, Governor"
"23806010","23808850"," Macklin saying that their confident inflation will come down. "
"23809710","23811090"," Yeah, give it the pump, baby."
"23812310","23816510"," Canada's given the old USA hand job to reach around on USA right now."
"23817670","23820450"," And it was like, don't worry, I got to I got to fed. "
"23826990","23828330"," Now, the matters of returns."
"23828670","23831850"," I don't I think the key is that we close today for 60."
"23832550","23834650"," We can trade sideways and down tomorrow. "
"23834650","23835450"," That's just fine."
"23835750","23843030"," But that lends to the bull case and then we can trade much higher on Amazon earnings and then trade"
"23843030","23846870"," sideways for the rest of the earnings season in a range."
"23847430","23850430"," You just don't want to be you want to be up here as a bull. "
"23850610","23854150"," Like work this hard to get to this point and not follow through."
"23855070","23857750"," That's key key that there's follow through at this point."
"23858370","23863930"," Watch some spy puts come in February 28 for 50 P eight hundred sixty six thousand dollars. "
"23872610","23874030"," Nope, no significant flow."
"23874750","23876750"," I think we're just grinding sellers right now."
"23878070","23883630"," Like you see a little bit of short covering into you're seeing some resistance disappear right here"
"23883630","23887070"," where we are right now more showing up at the same time. "
"23887650","23894670"," I'm going to look for a flat clothes and maybe a squeeze higher just based upon short covering to"
"23894670","23897370"," four sixty you're going to wait for a Facebook earnings."
"23898270","23902110"," Do I think that you should put a long on here?"
"23902210","23903350"," No, I think these strangle it."
"23904470","23912730"," I think these straddle you could straddle like some zero dates for a good Facebook ER and then also"
"23912730","23917730"," straddle or the other side you take a much longer put into OPEC's. "
"23918370","23923550"," We all know that OPEC's right you guys all know that an OPEC's is coming up on the 18th and"
"23923550","23924370"," 16 days."
"23925490","23930210"," Now you guys all know that by like the 10th or 12th we do typically start to trade sideways to"
"23930210","23934370"," down into OPEC's right we're all on the same page on that right."
"23940220","23944660"," That's not something to expect inflation to remain close to five percent for the first half of this"
"23944660","23944860"," year. "
"23948230","23949510"," I keep talking about inflation."
"23950770","23959980"," So now we're at four fifty seven eighty four four fifty seven eighty five."
"23962360","23967420"," We have four sixty in a close commit short covering to four sixty into the belt. "
"23968620","23969840"," That's the bull's need to do."
"23970100","23974300"," Can't come up from four twenty and not take four sixty."
"23974780","23975520"," It is critical. "
"23976620","23980980"," 40 minutes to the U.S. Capitol and S&P futures breaking out to new highs on the day up"
"23980980","23983860"," about forty nine handles now at forty five eighty four."
"23984380","23987220"," The doubt close to two hundred and forty eight points."
"23989670","23990150"," Push it. "
"23990730","23992310"," Push it into the close."
"24003480","24005060"," Four sixty is the target."
"24009220","24014720"," Watching Facebook calls spy calls coming in February two four fifty eight C."

"24044880","24047140"," We're now up to four fifty eight on the spy."
"24047560","24049440"," Should see short covering into the close."

"25336150","25339180"," I don't know what it was right now."
"25339620","25340940"," I think it was some stupid. "
"25348730","25349290"," Oh, no."
"25349450","25352650"," So I said, I never said that Tesla was going to 450 as I was going to 750."
"25359500","25361940"," Never said 320s in 2022. "
"25362420","25369750"," Not that I remember unless I didn't just remember it."
"25373510","25380110"," I think I said 360s on Spide, didn't I?"
"25380850","25382870"," Was it 360s or was it 320s?"
"25386640","25387840"," I thought it was 390."
"25388500","25389080"," I don't remember. "
"25390660","25397240"," You don't have to do for you guys is break out a chart that shows all the key levels for"
"25397980","25400600"," the spy and Tesla."
"25425430","25429870"," Yeah, I think 390 is open on the chart."
"25429870","25437410"," So the if we, depending upon what rejection is like, we can trade down to 390, I think. "
"25440610","25445610"," No, but I've seen a lot of a lot of people saying, oh, no, it's only 420 now."
"25445730","25446750"," It's not 390."
"25449690","25453790"," We can't tell if those are bulls that just don't want to say that or see it, trade that low. "
"25460480","25465320"," 15 minutes left or 60 minutes left into the close, 344, almost 345."
"25466120","25467980"," We've got 15 minutes left in the bell here."
"25468020","25472740"," It looks like they're they're tagging it up into the close more than likely today, rather than"
"25472740","25472980"," yesterday. "
"25473460","25475240"," We have major resistance yesterday."
"25475380","25476260"," We did not."

"25486900","25488840"," that the threshold will be met according to a source. "
"25492410","25496850"," So probably probably won't see a squeeze here, but even without the squeeze, we should be able to"
"25496850","25497430"," trade up to 460."
"25498310","25501170"," We just get just the short covering should get us to 460."
"25502470","25506290"," The squeeze in that play is probably not there for the bell. "
"25508500","25509020"," We're here."
"25509240","25510360"," We're here for a reason, right?"
"25510540","25516800"," If we're going to trade up to 460, we are here to look at a bullish context."
"25517680","25518560"," We're here to look for it. "
"25518560","25522200"," You don't trade up to 460 for just no apparent reason."

"25574620","25581460"," I think the only thing that I remembered about the market, no, I think you might have heard me talk"
"25581460","25585200"," about if we trade below certain numbers."
"25585940","25591640"," I think I gave a market crash case what needs to be met for market crash. "
"25595060","25596460"," But what would have to happen?"
"25596600","25600720"," I think that was when you have a red, I think this has to do with the conversation."
"25601020","25606040"," If you have a red month, it leads into another red month."
"25606140","25608840"," If you get a second red month, that makes you one red quarter. "
"25609300","25614220"," What you have to recover from in that one red red quarter, if you don't and have a second red"
"25614220","25617860"," quarter, they start to add up and the damage becomes a turn."
"25618140","25624140"," So you can't, no one can predict a market crash or even just a market downturn."
"25624760","25631020"," But when you add up months, quarters, and then you do a half a year, you can trade down to"
"25631020","25633020"," much lower multiples over time. "
"25633900","25639000"," But they have to prove themselves each month, quarter, etc, etc, etc, as they add up."
"25639800","25642080"," And right now we just had a bad month."
"25642780","25650800"," So while we are still on the lookout for now, let's say February turns red or March turns red, that"
"25650800","25652540"," then gives us a bad quarter. "
"25653080","25660920"," If you have a bad quarter, that goes from the Bank of Canada's Maclum, he says that the balance"
"25660920","25663880"," sheet runoff works further out on the yield curve."
"25664780","25667280"," So the primary instrument for tightening is the interest rate."
"25675670","25684350"," Yeah, I think there was this, if you want to talk about the market decline, it has to do with"
"25684350","25688150"," some things proceeding each other to get to a certain point. "
"25689250","25695030"," Because there was a discussion of, we're going to have a market crash and a market crash you can't"
"25695030","25695730"," predict, right?"
"25695930","25701930"," You can't predict a market crash, but you can predict over time a market decline, if we have a"
"25701930","25707950"," decline by setting up bad months, bad quarters, multiple bad quarters, and then years."
"25710640","25712540"," And what those projections are."
"25713580","25715280"," That's when you get into the really ugly numbers. "
"25720810","25725750"," And there's tail, there's tail risk companies out there."
"25725890","25729270"," I'll give you guys some links to, I've posted them on Twitter before."
"25730110","25732550"," So Mark Cuban, right, is famous for this. "
"25733690","25741810"," It's like Mark Cuban ends up taking out a force before the dot com crash."
"25743330","25747570"," They were people looking for tail risk event protection."
"25748730","25752770"," And what they do is they look at the worst outcome that could possibly happen. "
"25753510","25758050"," And then they buy, they roll, they buy and roll out protection that costs nothing."
"25758590","25762190"," These tail risk events, these right side or right hand tail risk events."
"25762930","25766350"," And they talk about them, they could happen from something that's unexpected. "
"25766830","25772730"," So like when you see a market decline that that's that huge, it can be a matter of just being"
"25772730","25773390"," cyclical."
"25773710","25777810"," It could be a matter of being on the end of a short of a long term debt cycle."
"25778090","25782050"," It could be the matter that we're for an end of a short term debt cycle. "
"25782410","25784750"," And then you have some kind of an event that we don't know about."
"25785130","25786890"," You'd have like a war that's unexpected."
"25787630","25791210"," You'd had something like a terrorism attack that was was unexpected. "
"25792050","25796830"," You have some kind of an event that affects the country while we're in a market decline."
"25796830","25806810"," And so you take these way, way, way, way, way you buy or you sell, you buy a"
"25806810","25813270"," way, way, way outside of the money put and you sell two inside the money puts and then they cost"
"25813270","25813810"," you nothing."
"25815710","25821130"," And you do this, you roll this out every three months, six months in case that does happen or take"
"25821130","25821390"," place. "
"25823170","25823870"," You can do them further out."
"25832360","25837260"," You can't see 450 without certain things happening first, but you can start it out."
"25838180","25839500"," You can do it technically. "
"25839780","25840980"," It's easy to do technically."
"25853660","25855280"," Yeah, we can we can sit here."
"25855460","25858400"," We can sit here and have another video about it. "
"25858400","25861140"," If you like, I can explain it better to you."
"25862740","25870560"," If you need to at any time, if you need to explain it to you in a better way."
"25872800","25878200"," I thought I feel as though oftentimes some of the things that I say to you are taken out of"
"25878200","25878540"," context. "
"25883830","25884970"," I could be wrong on that."
"25898910","25905090"," I think as a matter of fact, if you just go back to the video from this morning today's video"
"25905090","25912810"," and just start there, that even explains it because yesterday I was asked am I still bearish and I"
"25912810","25913710"," am still bearish."
"25913830","25918530"," As a matter of fact, if you don't break 460 today, right, I'm still bearish. "
"25920150","25923450"," If you don't break 460 tomorrow, I'm still bearish."
"25923670","25925710"," You technically have to break 460."
"25927730","25933050"," You have to break this resistance channel for you to get neutral on the market. "
"25934470","25936810"," I think I spoke about that for half an hour this morning."
"25936810","25943370"," There are conditions that need to be met as you move your way through the market."
"25944810","25951570"," And as long as you don't meet those conditions, they don't add up to anything in the future. "
"25952250","25957610"," I can't predict for you tomorrow that we're going to be at 480 or that we're going to be at"
"25957610","25957950"," 400."
"25958810","25964410"," But I can tell you exactly what it takes for us to meet or to expect those things to happen."
"25965930","25966950"," Does that make sense?"
"25976260","25976840"," Yeah, it's okay. "
"25977020","25977660"," I can reiterate it."
"25980860","25985540"," This is often a, I do this myself."
"25985760","25989960"," I'll oftentimes I'll hear someone else talk or I'll have someone else in a video talk and then I go"
"25989960","25992120"," back and watch it again and I'm like shit, I missed that part. "
"25992560","25994260"," Or shit, I wanted to hear what I wanted to hear."
"25995080","25995500"," I do it myself."
"26001850","26005790"," But if you start to break through key supports, when you start breaking through key supports, if"
"26005790","26009890"," they hold, as a matter of fact, if you just look, if you just watch the video from this morning,"
"26010490","26012190"," I laid it out quite simply for you. "
"26013090","26017010"," We're in a, you can look at this square chart from today."
"26018550","26021510"," I did a chart like a just a shitty crayon drawing."
"26022550","26026950"," And if you don't, if you're not meeting certain expectations, as a matter of fact, I've charted it"
"26026950","26033470"," out, I've done multiple, multiple, multiple videos on how to catch knives on stocks, which are"
"26033470","26034630"," another great example. "
"26035190","26041270"," People are always wanting to buy dips, right, or buy knives, catch knives on stocks."
"26041950","26048870"," And I've done multiple, multiple videos on just how to, how to pick a falling knife or catch a"
"26048870","26049390"," falling knife."
"26049490","26058330"," What needs to be met, how to set alerts for the return in a stock to stop its, its corrective"
"26058330","26059530"," phase, right?"
"26059830","26063910"," And if those things are met, you can't take that stock as bullish. "
"26063910","26070450"," Oftentimes, you'll find traders will see a move like you've seen in the spy right now, on a stock"
"26070450","26075550"," and individual ticker, and they will get too bullish on it, and we'll have a turn, and it'll start"
"26075550","26080590"," to continue to trade down from that point until the corrective move is over."
"26082310","26087090"," So at every turn, at every critical juncture, you're looking for certain things to happen."
"26091110","26094570"," And it's critical right now for the bulls, for where we are in the chart. "
"26094570","26102430"," As a matter of fact, you can see where I posted the chart for today from ES."
"26107570","26108910"," These things must be met."
"26110490","26114090"," It's a trap constantly for bulls and bears. "
"26115210","26116410"," They both fall into it."
"26123960","26125200"," So when you're asked, are you bullish?"
"26125620","26125700"," Yes."
"26126220","26127060"," Are you bearish?"
"26127460","26127540"," Yes. "
"26128180","26128740"," Are you neutral?"
"26129220","26129440"," Yes."
"26129760","26131260"," And then what is the turning point?"
"26132000","26134680"," Yesterday, right, side of the broadcast, I was asked, are you still bearish?"
"26135140","26136080"," And I said, yes."
"26136660","26142100"," And there's reasons for being bearish, legitimate reasons. "
"26142480","26148860"," The same reasons why when you're bullish, and you say, I'm buying this dip, you have to have facts"
"26148860","26152300"," behind why you buy that dip, right?"
"26152440","26153840"," You have to have a basis behind it."
"26153840","26156440"," Are you still in this upward channel or not?"
"26157240","26159980"," And we're still in a downward channel as of today."
"26160940","26167720"," So we need to see above 460 to break out of this downward corrective channel that we're in on the"
"26167720","26168940"," spy specifically. "
"26179670","26180270"," 45809."

"26234850","26238790"," You got to take into consideration if we have expansion to the call side and the upside."
"26239490","26242270"," So we layer everything that we do, right?"
"26242390","26246130"," We traditionally chart, we look at call expansion, put expansion."
"26247950","26250470"," We're looking at the book map, of course, right?"
"26251030","26256130"," And then we're looking for classic technical and fundamental indicators on the stock market. "

"26298960","26303740"," You can't call for 480 without breaking out of a corrective channel, right?"
"26303940","26308900"," There can't be a bull out there that calls for 480. "
"26309540","26312440"," We've got some spy puts coming in right now."
"26313180","26323080"," February 7, 457P for 200,000 spy puts February 18 for 50P for 846,000."
"26324400","26330320"," We can't call for 480 right now and not just use basic technical analysis. "
"26330780","26337160"," We're talking basic, like brand new, first time trading or buying a stock, let's say you've been"
"26337160","26339980"," trading a stock for six months trading the stock market."
"26340380","26345560"," If you don't understand that we have to break out of a corrective downward channel, you shouldn't"

"26350100","26351180"," That's 100%. "
"26351180","26358640"," And that fundamental analysis of a stock applies on both up and down."
"26359260","26360660"," So I don't know I'll say on that."
"26361180","26363100"," 359, we did not trade to 460. "
"26363900","26371920"," We're stuck pinned right into the close at 457.29. We're going to stick around here after the bell"

"26377800","26378380"," come in."

"27953870","27959530"," toy anymore right they totally lose interest in it and so you've got the whole entire market now"
"27959530","27965790"," after Amazon is going to start looking elsewhere for new trades and we're walking like the plank"
"27965790","27970430"," every day where they're setting us up is what they're doing they're setting us up telling you send"

"28019090","28024270"," for now the surprising thing would be if we do trade down uh and retest that low down at 420"
"28024270","28032690"," or 430 that would be a shocker and I'm sure right now I know right now for a fact that"
