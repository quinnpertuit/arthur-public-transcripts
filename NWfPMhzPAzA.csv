"NWfPMhzPAzA","0","10960"," Good afternoon traders, welcome to a weekend brief, this is Captain Jim James, I usually"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","10960","15120"," stay away from the internet over the weekend if I can, but I did notice that there was"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","15120","22400"," a lot of bear sentiment as usual, and we are open here to the SPX chart, and this is looking"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","22400","23400"," very toppy."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","23400","29080"," All I keep hearing about is the VIX, the VIX, UVXY, or UVXY."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","29080","33640"," Everyone's talking about lockdowns, the Delta variant, whenever things get this bearish"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","33640","36440"," on the weekend, I always take pause."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","36440","39400"," So I just want to quickly go over the S&P 500."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","39400","45360"," Of course things can change on Sunday futures, pre-market on Monday, but here are some things"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","45360","48800"," to consider coming into the, or coming into Monday."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","48800","55480"," I always see, to me it always looks like SPX gives a fair hint as to where we're actually"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","55480","56480"," going."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","56480","64320"," It tends to move slightly slower in the charts, not as jagged as ES, and I've been paying attention"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","64320","65960"," to SPX for that reason."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","65960","70520"," It tends to show tops a little bit more clearer, which right now it looks like we're at a top."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","70520","75040"," It looks like the market is rolling over from the viewpoint of SPX."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","75040","84080"," Heading on over to ES, I just want you to see this trip top, this resistance tread line"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","84160","89640"," here, and this support trend line here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","89640","101520"," And this is from way back in July of 2020, and if you look right here, this is the 31st."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","101520","109760"," We, on the 30th we topped, and we found some support along this established trend line"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","109760","111960"," end of July heading in September."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","112000","121320"," Now, if you were a bear on July 31st of 2020, this certainly looked like it was coming down"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","121320","133720"," that we were correcting, but as you can see, we found support and rocketed to be, this"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","133720","138520"," is like a, it looks like it's not quite an ascending triangle, but it's looking like"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","138520","139520"," one, right?"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","139760","150160"," So we ended up finding support, bounced up and over, and continued on until September"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","150160","159160"," 2nd, you can't tell me that there aren't bears from last summer that did not get salty"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","159160","164080"," as all fuck last summer between August and September."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","164080","167880"," Now, does that mean we do this again this year?"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","167880","175200"," Because we do, you know, one of the atages on Wall Street is over and over and over."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","175200","178200"," We do the same things and you still fall for it."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","178200","180280"," Will that hold true this year?"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","180280","188400"," It's hard to say, but I want you to remember this pattern here for what I'm going to show"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","188400","191680"," you here in a little bit, okay?"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","191680","195160"," So we're going to scroll back over to what's going on right now."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","195160","197200"," This is on ES, the mini."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","197200","202880"," And when you're looking at the mini, this started to form on Friday when we had this"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","202880","208240"," nice trend break here at the upper resistance."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","208240","215320"," Before this day here, it started to show itself, but, and I did play, I did sell my calls as"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","215320","223080"," soon as we hit that R2 in case we were forming this expanding wedge."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","223080","228160"," But, you know, the thing that there's some internals in here I want to take a look at"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","228160","234400"," from Friday's trading, which also mimicked what took place in the 19th."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","234400","242280"," On the 19th, we sold down in after hours, as well as in futures that pulled us straight"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","242280","248160"," down on a Monday down to this 425 area."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","248160","250040"," I don't think that we were actually coming down."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","250040","256400"," I feel as though this triggered, or this was a manufactured triggered."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","256400","265040"," Although we do see every month or so, you know, except for, I think June we didn't, but in"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","265040","272440"," May at least we came down, retested lows of our respective trading, lower trading channel"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","272440","273440"," down here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","273520","279440"," We did it again in June, we did it again in July, and the expectation would be that we"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","279440","280960"," would as well in August."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","280960","288120"," Here's the 19th, but that would be, this would be what you would expect in the month of August"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","288120","292600"," that we'd come back down and retest this low again."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","292600","297920"," So bears will put the full frontal assault on to get us there by this point."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","297920","303360"," They rely upon this every month to happen when it doesn't, they're not happy."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","303360","308600"," Because I would be unhappy as well if I was a bear, or if I was, I'd be unhappy as a"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","308600","314920"," bull if we didn't go up in a semi-regular fashion."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","314920","320280"," So the expectation is that even if we, let's say we were even to come up tomorrow, that"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","320280","323280"," we're going to continue this downtrend over time."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","323280","332200"," I'm going to show you another chart, which is going to show you two possibilities for"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","332200","339480"," a correction here in this upcoming next chart, but I do want you to see what everyone is"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","339480","341240"," looking at and what they're calling for."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","341240","346600"," Now if you still have the Armageddon bears calling for a larger drop, some are even calling"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","346600","354760"," for, I think we were at 406 recently, so they call them for somewhere down here, you know."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","354760","360800"," It's moving up every week or so, so it's probably somewhere down here, they're calling for this,"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","360800","367600"," and they call for this a lot, so take that for what you will."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","367600","372320"," But this is the predominant developing pattern."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","372320","384440"," There's another faster drop that takes place here, and that puts us at August 15th."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","384440","389000"," So you'd have to consider how much time you want to put on your shorts, as your scope"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","389000","395720"," the 20th, let's say, let's say it's the 19th or so, you get the 13th, and I have it"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","395720","399600"," on a chart that shows it happening even sooner or right around, I believe, the 8th or by"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","399600","403640"," the 8th, they'll still show you."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","403640","411200"," But this is what the bears are relying upon right here, for us coming down."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","411200","423720"," So remember when we jumped up last summer, I want to show you, this is the same chart"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","423720","431720"," on Weebell, just to give you some perspective as to where we should be going here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","431720","437520"," The bears are looking for this down here, and this actually puts us at August 4th, as"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","437600","445480"," the deepest will go in the cash market, and that could be deeper from the 3rd on ES."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","445480","450600"," But this chart here is showing us at the 4th."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","450600","458560"," So between the 4th and the 20th, to expect we hit this lower channel, would be the bear"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","458560","461560"," call."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","461560","466000"," But there's something else I want to show you here, and that's on this chart."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","466000","473700"," This is by, again, and let me just click back through, let me just show you the e-mini"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","473700","480160"," futures way back in August and September, and you see this pattern right here, and if"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","480160","493920"," you take a look, right here, if this gets, if this support here, this trending support"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","493920","500680"," line here is respected, this starts to look more like last summer."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","500680","506960"," So you are going to hear the drum beats that we need to go below this support line."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","506960","511120"," This is that 435, 436 support."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","511120","518600"," If we hold this, and the longer that we hold this, the higher the chances are going up,"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","518600","524720"," we're going to start climbing up to this 445, 446, even 450."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","524720","528520"," So you need to keep this in mind as you trade these next two days."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","528520","535800"," If you've already had one test, a second test, I would look for at least one more test in"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","535800","536800"," this coming week."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","536800","543440"," And if this is not breached, there is a fair chance of us going much, much higher for the"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","543440","545480"," month of August."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","545480","553600"," So keep this, keep this, this trend line here, this support line in focus as we move forward"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","553600","555400"," in the coming days."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","555400","562240"," Now I did also have some concern with how we dumped on Thursday into Friday."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","562240","571680"," Most of this selling took place in after hours, which is still open cash market, but at the"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","571680","574080"," same time it's low liquidity."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","574080","579520"," Not a lot happens in after hours, and not a lot of volume takes place in after hours."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","579520","586800"," And we found, or we tagged the support in the overnight."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","586800","589600"," So there was some concern there for me."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","589600","601920"," On the five day here, I deleted these, but I had posted 4405 as, I think it was 4405 and"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","601920","608960"," 449 somewhere in here was where my support or my support and resistance and I said to"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","608960","614680"," buy or go short at the at 4405."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","614680","620200"," And we did bounce off R1 and dropped."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","620200","624360"," I held these puts here, held them down here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","624360","626680"," And as we came up, I started to bleed."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","626680","630680"," So I ended up losing my, I ended up cashing out my puts."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","630680","639600"," And I went long into clothes on, I went long into clothes on some FDs, some call FDs."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","639600","646440"," And what concern me was this buy in here with 10 million shares and another 600,000 here"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","646440","649280"," and another 4 million."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","649280","656120"," And you can start to see a pattern here, these first few minutes of the clothes."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","656120","662920"," So that led me to think that it was possible that we might, even if we drop on Monday,"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","662920","667960"," have a quick spike up before we head down, if we head down."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","667960","673680"," One thing that's key on this is to remember this pattern right here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","673680","682440"," And August is shaping up for smaller and mid-cap stocks of the S&P, as well as small and mid-cap"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","682440","689560"," stocks within the NDX, energy, materials, financials."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","689560","693200"," And we still have earnings season for the month of August."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","693200","698960"," So parts of the IWM are inside of the S&P 500."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","698960","700840"," So there is still a chance here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","700840","708760"," And the way that this pattern is setting up is still looking very much so like this one"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","708760","711600"," right here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","711600","718040"," So if I was a bear, I would not be short unless we are under 435."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","718040","725920"," And as a bull, if this 435, 436 area here is respected, there will be a chance to go"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","725920","732520"," long as soon as we get above for this 441 upper resistance."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","732520","737640"," If we come above here and bounce, we are off to the races."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","737640","741200"," So as a retail trader, the one thing you want to keep in mind just to wrap up the weekend"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","742200","748720"," is that there is no reason to be long at this point here unless you are day trading."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","748720","754360"," The overall picture still says that the easy way is to head down from here."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","754360","759600"," So if you are long, you could be going long on day trades or buying weeklies that you"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","759600","765360"," would sell every day on established support and resistance lines, which I will publish"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","765360","768080"," on Sunday night."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","768080","773240"," The easy way is down, but if I was a bear, this is also a no man's land as well at this"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","773240","776440"," point in time."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","776440","784760"," So I would be short under 435.46 and I would be long over 443, let's look at 443 or so."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","784760","788960"," And especially this trend line here, if you beat this trend line right here, I would be"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","788960","794800"," looking up with going long at that point and trading within this trend this channel until"
"NWfPMhzPAzA","794800","795800"," at least late August."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","795800","798000"," Hope you all have a great weekend."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","798000","800720"," Don't drink too much of the Kool-Aid from the bears."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","800720","803360"," Don't drink too much of the Kool-Aid from the bulls as well."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","803360","806960"," This is where this really is a moment here of indecision."
"NWfPMhzPAzA","806960","807680"," Catch y'all Sunday night."
