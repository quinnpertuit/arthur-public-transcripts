"2850","5270"," All right, check my check."
"5430","7090"," One, two, three, four."
"11990","20470"," Get it prepped up for tomorrow. "
"28200","37080"," Good morning."
"39300","39600"," Good morning, good morning."
"39700","41800"," I start to see you guys pop in right now. "
"41940","42220"," Good morning."
"42860","45280"," I'm going to do a couple of quick things that I do here."
"45760","49140"," I'm going to do some great decision trapped today. "
"52320","54380"," Let's get right into it."
"58760","60060"," What am I going to do here?"
"62720","64220"," Sort by noose."
"66640","71260"," What am I doing here?"
"71440","72260"," I'm missing something here. "
"75640","79660"," This is something, this is something I don't know what I'm listening in."
"82240","88200"," Details, customization, and it's only monetization."
"90760","92980"," And what else we have here?"
"96980","98880"," Good to see you all. "
"100940","103320"," It's good board."
"103480","103920"," How's everybody doing?"
"103920","104840"," Let's get right into it."
"105680","106320"," I don't tap. "
"106500","108420"," Let me put my camera on for you."
"109160","112060"," Hang tight one second here and move some of this over."
"115540","117280"," Get my camera going here. "
"118180","119020"," Get rid of the color block."
"120660","121100"," Okay."
"121640","123520"," First of all, good morning to all of you. "
"123600","124900"," Thank you for being here today."
"125840","128820"," I'm with you here, but I'm not in stream a lot."
"129820","131320"," I apologize for that. "
"131440","133700"," I'm on this huge deadline for Friday."
"135520","138500"," And it requires, let me post this really quick."
"139380","140400"," One quick second here. "
"143820","146480"," What happens is this is on stream."
"146480","150800"," I'm on stream."
"151760","159540"," I get into the stream and then I'm not paying attention to these developers. "
"160060","160860"," I got a question."
"161140","162860"," If I don't answer it, it's like three hours later."
"163640","167060"," I answer it and then 12 hours later they get back to me. "
"167060","172340"," So if you're wondering why I'm not, the stream is up every day, but if you're wondering why I'm not"
"172340","173620"," here, it's because of that."
"173860","175960"," Basically, I have to be available."
"180660","183720"," So I'm going to tell you guys a few things off the right away. "
"184340","187660"," I'm likely not going to answer many questions."
"190680","195340"," So that I don't become sidetracked, not because I don't want to answer them anything like that."
"195880","199680"," It's more about I can't get sidetracked to have to get back to what I'm doing. "
"200120","209520"," So give me one quick second here and I'm going to give you guys a prep for tomorrow and what"
"209520","211740"," to expect that kind of stuff."
"213600","215740"," With the expectations are now."
"217820","219740"," I think I've got this on here. "
"219880","220140"," I'll take."
"220240","221420"," We'll take a look at something else too."
"221540","223620"," I think I have a bunch of rate decisions. "
"224800","227700"," And we'll chat about those previous rate decisions."
"228100","228620"," What happened?"
"230260","234880"," During those rate decisions, it's, you know, the thing about rate decisions of late."
"236600","246600"," Is they've been, they've been a benign, no up, no down, just benign. "
"247320","252440"," And we'll talk about that today because, or it's important to talk about that today because."
"253840","257220"," The market really is tied into."
"258600","263420"," The market really is tied into, as a matter of fact, right?"
"263580","264860"," I bought calls down here, right?"
"265400","269060"," I bought calls down here and they're just grinding me right now. "
"269260","270220"," It's kind of funny to watch."
"270460","273860"," I'm sitting in a bunch of calls here and we're going up and they're just grinding."
"275760","278640"," Hopefully you're buying in the money calls right now or puts. "
"279040","283520"," So if you're trying to go in a direction, whatever direction that is, make sure you're buying those"
"283520","287280"," calls or puts in the money like a strike or two."
"287280","292920"," Do not be buying calls that are 30 deltas, even 20 or 10 deltas on a turnaround."
"293600","295100"," Get them in the money to the upside. "
"295500","296760"," Make sure in the money deeply."
"297740","301140"," Otherwise, they're just destroying both sides of chains right now."
"301480","306260"," And I got some, I actually have some puts for Wednesday already. "
"306720","313780"," I've got a ratio spread for Wednesday and the puts are getting ground down right now."
"313780","317040"," They're all penny puts, but I'm fascinated by the fact that they're grinding them."
"317400","321000"," I'm like, when we were going down, as a matter of fact, when we were going down this morning, they"
"321000","321720"," were grinding them. "
"322060","323460"," So I was fascinated by that as well."
"323720","329240"," Just the mechanics of these options right now heading into this rate decision."
"332500","339360"," Now, we should talk about that this morning because there is a, there's a, if we broke about 460,"
"339840","349800"," 4600 and we're now stuck in this 4600 to 4650 on the week, I'm going to assume here that"
"349800","355840"," people are, they think it's going to go to 5000 this week or 1400 this week. "
"355860","356320"," It's possible."
"357120","362100"," But if we did, the expectation would be that we sell down in a massive way."
"364040","367980"," Pretty big violent moves down into end of year. "
"368380","369820"," So we'll trade it if it happens."
"370100","379720"," But even this rate decision, there's a high probability that they're not going to print"
"379720","380640"," either side."
"381260","387800"," My point here is that there's a high probability that just like an ER that they could, because"
"387800","393500"," there's so much interest in this rate hike, hike specifically, that they could just strap this"
"393500","397000"," market in, pull it back, you know, you get the downside or upside move. "
"397740","403060"," And then what they end up doing is, is pulling it back up for Friday."
"403820","410600"," So if you're looking for a range for this week, or for the rest of this week, let's say it's"
"410600","414420"," Tuesday already got Wednesday, we got one more day until we get that big move."
"414420","420920"," But even so, there's a very high probability of failure to the downside and the upside, and that we"
"420920","425080"," trade that 4600 to 4650 this week. "
"425280","434460"," So be aware of it that there's a magnet or a pin to this zone here into Friday."
"434820","440620"," Now, if we get a rate hike, we will break through that."
"440760","441680"," That ain't going to mean shit. "
"443640","452200"," We can definitely make a run to the downside if there is an unexpected rate hike."
"452760","454440"," We can talk about that today too."
"457260","461320"," So we've gone five months, coming on six months without a rate hike. "
"462340","464880"," I can't wait looking for it last night, I'll try to find it."
"464880","474800"," But I think it was from Traders Almanac where historically if we go five months without a rate"
"474800","475040"," hike."
"476220","481100"," And so this would mean that if he does not give us a rate hike, that is the end of"
"481100","481960"," the hiking cycle. "
"483500","486000"," Now I read some bullshit yesterday."
"486000","493020"," I read an article yesterday from some guy that said, well, you know, if they don't raise rates and"
"493020","498440"," they promise to hold rates here higher for longer, right?"
"499360","502740"," That it buys some time in that Goldilocks zone."
"504620","511919"," They can be saying that to you, but the truth be told we have not had a hike since July"
"511919","515159"," or I think it was the 28th of July. "
"515159","515919"," Don't hold me to that."
"516299","520020"," But I think it was right around the 27th, 28th of July was our last hike."
"520880","523280"," And so that means it's already been front run. "
"523880","529280"," Okay, so we've already got some months behind us in that Goldilocks zone."
"529500","531940"," And within that Goldilocks zone as well."
"533560","542760"," About two or three months before the first rate cut or expected rate cuts or whatever. "
"542760","549780"," We were normally hitting about two percent inflation by whatever fucking bullshit numbers they're"
"549780","550300"," putting out."
"550720","553520"," Unemployment should be ramping at that point as well."
"554200","558500"," And about two months before usually one month, two months before they expect to actually start to"
"558500","559660"," begin to cut rates. "
"560560","568080"," You should see a front running for a downside move that back checks wherever we are."
"568080","571700"," So price will matter here is the point that I'm trying to make."
"573160","574580"," We'll talk about that right now. "
"574760","577540"," I'll explain that simply for you, okay?"
"578600","579960"," We'll take a look at that right now."
"579960","582580"," So probably going to hold these fucking calls all day long."
"582780","587120"," That's what I've been doing is buying the money calls, hold them all day long, let the grind up"
"587120","587400"," happen. "
"587700","590780"," And then they sell, I don't know if that works today, but it's been working like a motherfucker."
"590940","593300"," So we'll see what happens today."
"594000","598680"," Find the debt, find the morning low, get some money calls, just hold them, let them grind it out"
"598680","599180"," all day long. "
"601060","604040"," They could possibly grind the sideways and down here today too."
"604400","606500"," We're one day away from the rate decision."
"607520","612100"," Now I'm going to discuss this and explain some of this stuff to you, okay?"
"614200","623820"," I was in a conversation late night last night and I was talking to I was talking to a friend"
"623820","627520"," last night about our two friends actually over the course of yesterday. "
"629340","636920"," We were discussing we were discussing, let's put this up on a daily here."
"637980","642780"," I'm not going to, I think I have this stuff here, but I think I can bring some of this"
"642780","643380"," stuff up."
"643640","645200"," Hold on here, let me see if I can bring something else up. "
"645400","646320"," Hold on, hang tight one second here."
"653500","657200"," And people are going to trade, some of this stuff, people are going to trade too."
"658480","662500"," Whether it proves right or wrong or not, but we're going to discuss this. "
"664580","667200"," And here, we're going to take a look at this real quick."
"667720","671340"," So the first thing to be thinking about here is a wipe off events."
"673440","676420"," And we have the initial sell down, right?"
"676660","677200"," We have the trough. "
"678660","682280"," We come above the trough, right?"
"682280","684000"," And we're off and running, right?"
"684180","686260"," People are wondering if that's where we are."
"687720","692380"," We also, these are accumulation wipe off models, of course."
"693140","697440"," And then these are the first two, these are the two of the accumulation wipe off models, but then"
"697440","699680"," we've got some distribution type stuff here. "
"701940","708640"," And let's say this was like March of, let's say this was January of 2022, even this was January of"
"708640","709140"," 2022."
"709960","712520"," This could be January, March, 2022, right?"
"712720","716320"," We'll come back up into test these previous highs."
"716940","718440"," This is a big one right here. "
"718920","722140"," So retesting these previous highs right here, right?"
"723180","723940"," It's important."
"724580","729960"," Number one, if you're a bull that we are able to get the new high, but then we back test"
"729960","731660"," this high and continue on."
"732320","733020"," Does that make sense?"
"734100","735220"," So we back test to continue on. "
"735220","742480"," It's also important that we do not get the new high and then begin to fucking sell, right?"
"742680","746020"," Down and have that last leg down to 3,500."
"747180","751280"," And then another issue here would be how deep does this go?"
"752340","761800"," And if we fail, actually fail the new high up here, it could mean real death and destruction to the"
"761800","762040"," downside."
"762040","769540"," So this whole area is going to be very important to the, to, to distribution accumulation models. "
"769820","771120"," Matter of fact, you can see this one here."
"771660","774660"," This is the failure back here and then we start blood bathing it down."
"774840","774980"," Okay. "
"775540","776900"," And we're looking at that 3,500."
"778260","782600"," Now we're going to switch back over to the trigger screen here."
"785060","787300"," And let me see if I can go to this trigger screen here. "
"787920","790340"," And you can kind of see we're back here again, right?"
"790340","791620"," We were back here again."
"791620","793320"," We've got the previous high back here."
"793400","794580"," We've got this high back here. "
"794640","796780"," This was a failure, right?"
"797020","799880"," There's, you remember everybody was calling for the blood down to the downside."
"800040","802020"," That's that white off distribution model."
"802160","802940"," Didn't happen. "
"803160","805620"," And then we're coming back up here to test this right here, right?"
"806780","808780"," And the idea here is."
"810320","812520"," The idea here is that."
"816540","818620"," This is that previous high, right?"
"821380","824280"," How high can we get price on the S&P 500?"
"825980","827860"," So whenever back tests that we do. "
"829080","832000"," Is either testing this level here."
"832600","836460"," This monthly could be the worst back test, right?"
"838000","842620"," But we never come back down to, we never come back down to actually test."
"843520","845360"," This 3,500 low. "
"845820","849760"," And even if we did, that would be the worst of it."
"850660","851160"," Okay."
"851680","858460"," So this, and this is the, we have high probability, mid probability, very low, very low"
"858460","858860"," probability. "
"859980","863740"," And this stuff starts to become no probability down here."
"863840","864640"," These lower numbers."
"864860","865680"," I'll show you these later. "
"867060","871020"," One of the greatest tricks that the Fed pulled was time on market, right?"
"871420","873260"," They had some time where they traded us down."
"873500","875500"," Market believed we're actually doing the work we're supposed to do."
"876040","878260"," And we don't, we don't want to have this moment. "
"878260","880200"," They don't care if we get this moment."
"881980","883240"," I'm going to be honest with you."
"883440","886800"," Biden, Jerome Powell, they do not care if we trade this. "
"887020","887960"," I want to warn you of that."
"888600","889980"," They care if we trade this."
"890940","895220"," But if we don't trade that, so even on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a"
"895220","895980"," scale of probabilities. "
"897380","900920"," They'll say mission accomplished even if we get out of this 3,500."
"902080","902480"," Okay."
"903360","907400"," 3,800, 4,000, like these are all very high probability up here. "
"907580","911780"," So they have a pretty good chance if they can get price up here to take care of that."
"912120","918760"," If you see more aggressive fed chair, and he's telling you, you know, eat a bag of dicks or"
"918760","920740"," whatever, this is way more probable."
"921220","926000"," And this whole sideways market to grind sideways is probable as well. "
"927460","927940"," Okay."
"928720","933700"," Now, word of word of warning here or not warning, but I want you to know."
"935400","941940"," That regardless of how this plays out or what happens or any other shit, I want you to know. "
"942740","947480"," That we will be able to see this if we do, let's say we do begin to break down below"
"947480","948360"," this hourly trigger."
"948360","949540"," We'll be able to see it."
"950280","955240"," You can actually see the breakdown here, the cross of the daily trigger over the weekly trigger. "
"955240","957380"," It showed extreme bearishness."
"957380","960360"," We smashed down to the monthly pullback up, right?"
"961080","968460"," If we were to begin to reject underneath, and the price was beginning to reject underneath, and the"
"968460","975100"," daily trigger began to follow underneath the monthly trigger and the weekly began to follow, we"
"975100","978740"," could predict that the expected target would be that quarterly trigger."
"979000","982440"," So you shouldn't be panicking here either is my point. "
"982440","985220"," We can see that roll before it happens."
"985500","991420"," We can anticipate that we're trying to target these previous lows and that kind of stuff."
"991680","996420"," So now the greatest trick that heading back to that greatest trick they fed ever pulled. "
"998580","1002600"," We're still pulling up on these low targets, right?"
"1002820","1008520"," We had real fear over here in this role to go down all the way down here."
"1008520","1012820"," But now even if we were to go down here, we kind of it's not as bad as it was"
"1012820","1013860"," back here in time."
"1014380","1024300"," So the more time they buy us going up or even sideways with continuation of holding for longer. "
"1024859","1030180"," They're buying themselves time to never come back and see that 3500 low."
"1032339","1037720"," These fuckers are these fuckers are pissing me off of this option Shane to no fucking end."
"1039020","1040319"," Is that any rate?"
"1040839","1042680"," And you know, you're looking at this low back here. "
"1042859","1043859"," This is the COVID low."
"1044079","1047079"," You really need something big to have this happen, which is possible."
"1047079","1049000"," We haven't had anything big for a few years. "
"1049560","1051100"," Right around three to three or five year mark."
"1051100","1054040"," We can have an event that'll drive us down very low."
"1055260","1057600"," So just keep your keep aware with that. "
"1057600","1062280"," But as we approach this, this is definitely behind the scenes."
"1062320","1063780"," Price will matter here."
"1064900","1069260"," All this price action and where price is will matter how far we pull back. "
"1070700","1072700"," I can say this simply for you too."
"1074100","1080120"," You know, we're trading 4,000."
"1081880","1084360"," 3500 is not so unreasonable is it?"
"1084360","1094080"," But when you begin to trade 4,800 5,000 and you start talking about wanting to not only trade,"
"1094080","1096940"," I mean the 3500 seems to be pretty steep, right?"
"1097820","1099360"," Trade in 4800. "
"1099400","1101300"," You're talking about losing a thousand points."
"1101720","1103400"," It's a pretty big move to the downside."
"1103920","1104180"," It's possible. "
"1105160","1106080"," It's just it's rare."
"1106480","1110300"," And these lower targets become almost absurd."
"1110300","1115900"," You know, you're going to tell me that we're going to go down 2,000 points or 1,500 points. "
"1117100","1119020"," I squint my eyes in question."
"1119700","1125900"," And even if we do, is it really is it now down at 2,800 or 3,200, 2,800,"
"1126080","1127640"," 1,600 way back over here?"
"1128360","1131280"," So here you had 1,900 and over here you had a."
"1133540","1134780"," 2560, so 2,618."
"1135800","1138740"," I think it was 18 over here and 2,600 over here when it began. "
"1138740","1142600"," So think about this right now if you're a bear."
"1143300","1147900"," I want you to think about the fact that the door is not shut on you."
"1148460","1150780"," The door is not shut on you, but. "
"1152140","1155720"," The door is shutting on you with that thesis of."
"1156740","1162220"," Well, we'll be back to see 3500 and we're going to see even lower than that, right?"
"1162460","1168340"," So it's rear view mirror almost now and price is showing that we just traded this point."
"1169160","1170820"," Just check SPX really quick. "
"1171500","1173620"," Just went back and check that previous high up there."
"1176780","1180500"," So my point to you is that my point to you is that."
"1181080","1186000"," We're rear view mirroring a lot of this shit, even if we even if we roll back, even if we"
"1186000","1187920"," have a roll over because of cutting rates. "
"1188520","1190340"," It's still rear view mirror."
"1191040","1194320"," I remember in October, we talked."
"1194520","1196520"," Remember in May, we talked about crashing farther. "
"1196520","1198360"," I remember not June July."
"1198520","1199260"," We talked about that."
"1199280","1200140"," I remember in October. "
"1200980","1204240"," We talked about that crashing lower and."
"1204600","1209860"," I also remember that I talked to the friend with yesterday that you guys may not remember."
"1210900","1212260"," There was a mantra. "
"1213420","1215040"," On fin to it that said."
"1215800","1219840"," I don't care that I didn't buy 3500 because we're going to see it again."
"1219880","1221520"," I'll get another chance to buy it. "
"1222160","1225700"," And my point to you was know you buy 3500 now."
"1225960","1228680"," And if we come back to 3500, you buy it a second time."
"1229380","1229680"," Why?"
"1230260","1235040"," Because there's a chance, a better chance, more of a chance of never coming back to it than it is"
"1235040","1237800"," a greater chance that we're going to see 3500 again. "
"1238420","1240780"," And that door is being closed."
"1241820","1246940"," That door for that seller out there with a million followers telling you they can come back to buy"
"1246940","1247880"," 3500."
"1248700","1251960"," They're going to be shut down yet again, historically. "
"1253060","1258080"," So if you're a young trader and you've only been trading, I don't know, past one, two, three years."
"1259380","1262440"," If you've been now, if you've been trading for five or ten years."
"1263360","1264780"," Been trading for 15 years. "
"1265460","1268500"," You're going to see your third, fourth or fifth major example."
"1270180","1276160"," Whenever we get those major blood baths are not a bear markets or crashes that you buy that fucking"
"1276160","1276460"," dip."
"1276460","1282120"," It's very rare that we go back and see those major lows. "
"1282520","1289300"," So as previous one, 3500, we've seen it four times, maybe five or six since the 1890s."
"1290200","1292220"," World War II, the Great Depression."
"1293520","1295280"," I know for sure. "
"1295660","1301100"," And then 2001 and 2008, seven, eight, one, two, zero, zero, two."
"1301860","1306760"," We saw lower low or lower lows, but you're talking about major things like."
"1307180","1313300"," Tell them major things like World Wars, right, depressions, major fraud in the market. "
"1313580","1316080"," But I agree with you, we have fraud in the market, but they have to see it for us."
"1316200","1317480"," We found fraud in the market."
"1317980","1322140"," Outside of those things, we don't historically go back and check those previous lows. "
"1323160","1328120"," It's just still rare view mirror, like you'll tag 3800 or 3700."
"1328720","1330400"," It's just a very low probability."
"1332180","1337440"," And then buying time on this markets right now, the past couple of years is shutting the door in"
"1337440","1338320"," that once again. "
"1339060","1340280"," So just keep that in mind."
"1340900","1345460"," We keep that in mind as we move forward in this market."
"1345800","1354580"," Now, I was like, I was talking to another friend last night and we were discussing or I was, I"
"1354580","1355760"," was at a ranch with him. "
"1357900","1360300"," I was on a ranch with him about some of this stuff."
"1360500","1365560"," And I was on a bigger ranch with a buddy of mine earlier in the day about Japan and where"
"1365560","1365980"," we are."
"1366820","1368360"," And this is how it started. "
"1369280","1371800"," Let's go back to the, we'll come back to this in just a minute here."
"1371840","1373080"," I want to go on a ranch really quick."
"1373420","1383180"," So we were chatting about, we were chatting about Japan"
"1383180","1387020"," and my life and his life. "
"1387020","1387720"," He's an older guy."
"1387780","1388340"," He's older than me."
"1388620","1392300"," And this was earlier in the day, in case both of these people are listening. "
"1392620","1394920"," But the earlier they have sounded, God's older than me."
"1395540","1396160"," But I'm older."
"1396600","1397240"," I'm an older guy. "
"1397640","1399520"," And I've lived through a bunch of these cycles."
"1400100","1402140"," And I was impacted by this as a child."
"1402640","1404360"," In 1987, I was a very young child. "
"1404580","1405560"," My father had everything."
"1406400","1407100"," He had houses."
"1407580","1408120"," He had rentals. "
"1408480","1409360"," He had businesses."
"1410740","1411680"," We had everything."
"1412140","1413560"," We literally, we moved out of the city. "
"1413560","1415260"," We moved up of the country."
"1415400","1416680"," We had an in-ground pool."
"1416940","1417980"," We had acres of land. "
"1418200","1421580"," We had housekeepers and people that took care of our yard."
"1421880","1422800"," And we had everything."
"1423600","1424840"," We were upper middle class. "
"1425560","1426300"," And he lost it all."
"1426920","1427980"," He over leveraged himself."
"1428600","1430840"," 1987 crash came in and he was holding his dick. "
"1431500","1432640"," And he lost everything."
"1433400","1434300"," I remember my mother."
"1435560","1442120"," I remember I was sitting in my house and my father and mother had just, like, replaced everything"
"1442120","1444040"," in our house with new shit. "
"1445080","1448040"," And I remember my dog had a dog house up on the hill."
"1448800","1450200"," And on the side yard that we had."
"1450880","1452740"," And my dad walked my mom outside. "
"1454220","1456440"," And my mom collapsed crying."
"1457820","1458180"," On her knees."
"1459020","1460060"," I fell down on her knees. "
"1461180","1462720"," I knew something was wrong."
"1463740","1466060"," And my dad over night."
"1466060","1468360"," Not overnight, but of course, a week or two. "
"1469800","1470460"," Lost everything."
"1472760","1477500"," So that was my first introduction to what is the stock market?"
"1477720","1478600"," What is my dad?"
"1478940","1479940"," My mom's so upset about."
"1480240","1481040"," And they lost everything. "
"1481300","1482860"," They thought they were going to be able to keep some stuff too."
"1483520","1484460"," And they took it all."
"1485200","1490160"," The end result, what was all said and done, attorneys promised them they could keep their house and"
"1490160","1490800"," keep like that. "
"1491040","1493460"," I think it was one nice car that they had."
"1493460","1496360"," They took every fucking thing they had."
"1496800","1497300"," Okay. "
"1497880","1499080"," What's the meaning of that?"
"1499280","1502600"," The point is they were washing out people in that crash, right?"
"1502720","1503460"," They're washing out people."
"1503920","1507440"," Even if they had good debt, it was still bad debt."
"1508080","1509420"," They were over leveraged. "
"1509680","1512180"," Too much debt in case something went wrong."
"1512980","1514500"," My dad was wealthy, man."
"1514580","1515560"," My dad's wealthy this day. "
"1516140","1520380"," But he got washed out and it was brutal at that time."
"1520380","1524740"," Now, at that time, hamburgers, we talk about hamburgers around here."
"1524800","1526080"," He had been following me for years. "
"1526700","1527860"," Talk about eggs, right?"
"1528100","1529480"," I don't want to marry the landscaper."
"1529880","1536000"," I talked to you about how these companies, these produce, not just the producers, but the, like"
"1536000","1541800"," your egg maker, they have a plan for 10, 15 years until they can reprice, right?"
"1542140","1545780"," Once they latch on to that reprising, they don't let go of it."
"1545980","1548140"," No matter what the feds telling you or anyone else. "
"1548140","1551660"," So if they can get in there and raise those prices, they will."
"1551940","1556780"," And then give you, once you accept that price, they'll go back and give you discounts and stuff."
"1557420","1561600"," But they, they, they got to raise prices like burgers, hamburgers, cheeseburgers. "
"1562100","1563800"," They don't fucking come down in price."
"1564440","1565000"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1566380","1568240"," No matter what the feds telling you."
"1568460","1573640"," Even if we get back to a year over year, a rate of inflation of 2.2% inflation still"
"1573640","1575820"," fucking going up every year. "
"1576800","1579300"," And we know this is going to happen."
"1580600","1585620"," They are shocking you right now with, are you being shocked with prices right now?"
"1586040","1589040"," That will not ever fucking come back down."
"1589340","1594700"," And you're also seeing wages coming up. "
"1595340","1605200"," You're seeing airline pilots, UPS drivers, FedEx, unions across the U.S. renegotiating"
"1605200","1613220"," for an entry level worker being paid in four to five years afterwards, $150,000 in paying benefits."
"1614180","1617140"," That means that your McDonald's worker at some point will have to come up."
"1617280","1622120"," In the meantime, some companies are going to squeeze that worker until they're forced into it,"
"1622980","1623200"," right?"
"1623400","1629360"," And they're also going to raise prices to squeeze the people that can pay it, right?"
"1629360","1639040"," And this week I was looking at apartment and house rentals around the country, $2,000 in a shit"
"1639040","1639240"," hole. "
"1639560","1640580"," Oh, not a shit hole, but a shit hole."
"1640700","1647600"," Like when I consider middle America or suburban America, if you know a three bedroom house with two"
"1647600","1652280"," baths, if they're about two grand where you live, you live in middle America."
"1652460","1653600"," You want to live in anywhere. "
"1653600","1654860"," Anywhere."
"1655140","1662640"," That is prized like LA, New York, Park City, fucking Miami, wherever."
"1663500","1667140"," We're talking five, six grand entry to 15,000 a month. "
"1668380","1673280"," So if I was to move to Vale right now, I'd probably entry level about five grand."
"1673760","1683240"," That's $60,000 a year."
"1684560","1690900"," That means I got to make what 70 or 80 just to pay that, right?"
"1691420","1693620"," Let's say that's 25% of my income. "
"1694160","1696320"," That's closer to $400,000."
"1697120","1703160"," So you've got you've got companies and people and landlords and everybody out there that are"
"1703160","1709740"," pricing in you for being forced to make more money to pay more 10% of adults in the United"
"1709740","1713460"," States of America, 9.75%. Our millionaires."
"1714400","1715500"," That's a fucking lot. "
"1716180","1717920"," 10 out of every 100 is a millionaire."
"1719840","1721140"," Wages are going to come up."
"1721700","1722800"," Prices are going to come up. "
"1723520","1727820"," This is all being priced in in this new cycle that's happening right now."
"1728260","1731200"," And Jerome is on the hot seat on this, right?"
"1731640","1737320"," Even if he goes higher for longer, right, even if we crash the market down, the rest of the economy"
"1737320","1741240"," is pricing in inflation."
"1742460","1746040"," And higher wages over time. "
"1746200","1750900"," And this actually makes our stock markets worth way less than it is."
"1751360","1756040"," I'll show you today the Ford PE ratios for the S&P 500."
"1756580","1758140"," They're at the buy stage here. "
"1759060","1765500"," When you see people out there talking about the S&P 500 going to five or 6,000 quickly, they"
"1765500","1766300"," fucking mean it."
"1766920","1767580"," They mean it."
"1767580","1771720"," You can see eight, nine, 10,000 in 10 or 15 years easily. "
"1772740","1776740"," If we were if the way that these cogs are moving down the road."
"1778460","1779420"," It's huge."
"1779720","1780080"," It's big. "
"1780260","1781540"," It's a problem too."
"1782360","1786900"," So Jerome Powell is in this place where does he destroy everything?"
"1787820","1789140"," He has to destroy him."
"1789220","1791480"," I'm a bull, but I got to tell you, he has to destroy everything. "
"1791640","1792720"," He doesn't destroy everything."
"1793420","1799060"," The path we're taking is a very similar to Japan."
"1800020","1806400"," And you're talking about apartments going to 35,000 fucking dollars, 40, 50,000 dollars a month. "
"1807180","1809820"," And we know what happened in Japan thereafter, right?"
"1810140","1812440"," It was long and it lasted forever in Japan."
"1813320","1817760"," U.S. hedge funds got blown up trying to short that shit and they got run right over for what"
"1817760","1818680"," a decade and a half."
"1819600","1822480"," Now, the pain that Japan went through thereafter was brutal. "
"1822860","1823260"," It was sideways."
"1824160","1825080"," It was brutal."
"1825580","1829320"," We're talking about like, let's say we have one more bull run, let's say for five, six, seven"
"1829320","1829600"," years. "
"1830400","1838320"," And if we end up turning into Japan, you could see, you could see like just horrible"
"1838320","1843900"," stagflation for a decade, more than a decade, something like that."
"1844720","1846980"," But there is real greed right now out there."
"1846980","1853520"," There are there are there are cogs turning in the background right now that I can see client plane"
"1853520","1858480"," is fucking day where for you to be middle class, it used to be. "
"1859060","1866720"," If you were single, this was pre COVID, about 90 to $120,000 a year for a single person."
"1866920","1871020"," If you had a husband and a wife, it was pretty well accepted that you and your wife or you"
"1871020","1873140"," are a wife and wife or a man and man, I don't care."
"1873140","1881240"," But if you're married, that during your working years outside of childbearing or adopting children"
"1881240","1887060"," or whatever, you could probably make about 200,000 right around there high end to 60 low end 180"
"1887060","1887720"," somewhere there. "
"1887840","1889220"," You're doing pretty fucking well."
"1890160","1891760"," That is not the case anymore."
"1892520","1898600"," You have to strive in my viewpoints in the next five, 10 years to make no less than three to"
"1898600","1900060"," $400,000. "
"1900700","1907740"," Three to $400,000 to be able to compete to be able to stay in the pack to be able"
"1907740","1910760"," to stay with what's going on as time progresses."
"1911040","1913300"," So he's in a tough place right now."
"1913640","1916620"," He really, really is in a hard place. "
"1916780","1921200"," Jerome Powell, I would not want to be him coming into this rate decision at all."
"1921200","1926720"," And if we go back to that discuss what I said to you about five months passing, he probably already"
"1926720","1933760"," knows that if he does not raise rates, even if the market believes him that it's higher for longer."
"1934340","1939080"," It will, it will set in motion, which it already has, you can see it, right?"
"1939260","1945820"," You can see it's already in motion right now, pricing in eventual rate cuts that we don't get any"
"1945820","1946340"," more rate cuts. "
"1946340","1948120"," They're going to price this shit in."
"1948540","1955000"," And about two months before they do begin to cut rates, they will price in that back check to the"
"1955000","1955320"," downside."
"1956260","1959760"," It's a really hard place for Jerome. "
"1960780","1962560"," He has not pulled a Volcker yet."
"1964060","1970300"," And I don't know what to say to that for you out there as Bob or Joe on Main Street."
"1970460","1971800"," I don't know what to say to you. "
"1972960","1978560"," It's very sad because a lot of people are going to get, well, if you're young, you're going to be"
"1978560","1980520"," in a great position if you don't mind that."
"1981280","1985400"," But if you're older, you're going to get, you're going to get, you're going to get broken half,"
"1985640","1985760"," right?"
"1986060","1991520"," If you're no longer working, if you are just relying upon savings here at the end of your cycle of"
"1991520","1996380"," working, end of your professional career, no one's going to hire you and pay you three or four to"
"1996380","1996580"," grand."
"1996580","2002980"," You're going to hire a kid, pay him less and squeeze him for the next, you know, five, ten years"
"2002980","2004080"," long as they possibly can. "
"2005440","2011020"," So that, I guess that could be big to the stock market, but I don't know that those two intertwine."
"2011280","2017680"," I think they run the stock market up and they're going to squeeze out the, you know, a lot of"
"2017680","2020020"," people who, people, people I just mentioned."
"2023420","2028960"," Yeah, so go boy, just saying I'm paying 2k in Ohio, but I just looked in Ann Arbor, Michigan. "
"2029720","2032220"," So I just bought another house, I'm going to renovate, right?"
"2032720","2036800"," And I'm like, I'm going to go stay in Ann Arbor for three months while I do this renovation."
"2038060","2040520"," Five grand, five fucking thousand dollars."
"2040660","2042440"," I can pay that fucking veil right now. "
"2043220","2043660"," I don't need to go."
"2044340","2045880"," Ann Arbor ain't got nothing on veil."
"2046300","2048120"," You got zero on veil or any of those places. "
"2049860","2051460"," That's a lot of money for a lot of people."
"2051460","2052020"," Right?"
"2052340","2057780"," So there's this like, there's this separation right now that's going to come eventually come"
"2057780","2060199"," together, but you can already see it."
"2060320","2062840"," You can already see it and what you're being charged out there. "
"2063260","2066080"," You can see it when you're being charged in fast food."
"2066260","2071120"," You can see it what you're being charged in rentals, you know, fuck gas."
"2071300","2072280"," I don't care about the price of gas. "
"2072460","2077400"," I care about, you know, I mean, can get the lower gas, help the economy doesn't go to blow 60."
"2077420","2077780"," Sure."
"2077940","2080520"," And it will take some of the pain out. "
"2080520","2089320"," But this looks and smells to me like when I was young, when I came into the workforce, when I"
"2089320","2094199"," was about 18 years old, right, 18, 19, 20 years old as the army, right, went to college."
"2095020","2097540"," And my father had taught me how to cook and stuff."
"2097620","2101460"," When I was young, I went to cook to pay my way through school, right, to pick up a job"
"2101460","2101740"," cooking. "
"2102280","2103100"," That was a good cook."
"2103700","2106800"," They're paying me like 20 bucks an hour into COVID."
"2107600","2110200"," I know they were paying a lot of cooks still 20 bucks an hour. "
"2110200","2112620"," So I caught the early part of that cycle."
"2113160","2117940"," You're likely at a new early part of a cycle like it was when I was a young kid."
"2118360","2121900"," When I was roughly around 18, 20 years old, you're probably at one of those points. "
"2122240","2127800"," And prior to when I was 18, 20 years old, there was wage stack inflation for 10, 20 years before"
"2127800","2128560"," then as well."
"2128840","2130520"," So think about that stuff."
"2130740","2132200"," If you're young, think about that stuff. "
"2132360","2137740"," If you're old and where Jerome is in this cycle, how it matters in the economy and all that kind"
"2137740","2138060"," of stuff."
"2138500","2143800"," So if we're going to go down that track, our stock market is cheap as fuck."
"2144760","2148060"," You're going to look back on this in 10 or 20 years and be like, I remember 3500. "
"2148940","2150200"," I should have bought down there somewhere."
"2150920","2153400"," Does it make sense to see if you're a young person out there right now?"
"2153820","2157860"," If you ever go back and check that 3500 or somewhere down in there and people are all crying or"
"2157860","2162780"," whatever, you're probably getting, you probably either had a generational buying opportunity last"
"2162780","2170040"," October, May, or you're going to get one more chance at it for the next 10 or 20 years."
"2170880","2180680"," I would expect the S&P 500 to literally go on a scream to the upside, just scream"
"2180680","2181400"," to the upside. "
"2182880","2188420"," I don't think he's going to fundamentally, these companies, like what the Fed tells you, what the"
"2188420","2191240"," companies are doing are two different things."
"2191600","2197660"," Forget the stock market, look at what the Fed, the Treasury Department is doing, and then I want"
"2197660","2200160"," you to look at what corporations are doing."
"2200920","2208060"," So the role of Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen is to appease Bob on Main Street. "
"2209940","2214280"," Other role is to disseminate information to market participants."
"2214280","2224000"," But then you've got other places that you can look where they don't care about what the"
"2224000","2227300"," Fed's saying, what Janet's saying to market participants."
"2227640","2232720"," They don't care what those people, what Jerome's talking to Bob about. "
"2233260","2239060"," They have very smart people that work for them that say, I don't give a fuck what Jerome is saying."
"2239060","2243380"," I don't give a fuck what Janet's saying, raise the fucking price of eggs."
"2245140","2246180"," You know what I'm saying?"
"2247880","2250200"," So I'm listening to those people. "
"2250340","2251900"," Those are the people that I'm looking towards."
"2252900","2259140"," Like, why are they agreeing to these negotiations on labor deals with unions?"
"2259520","2262160"," It's because they can see it in the future."
"2262400","2264940"," They know what's coming down the road. "
"2265620","2269760"," And I would warn you from an age perspective if you're young."
"2270520","2277900"," If you're much older than me, if you're 60s, 70s, 50s, 60s, 70s, maybe you can even chime in and"
"2277900","2281340"," try to tell younger people that you've been through this even more than me."
"2282060","2286200"," You've witnessed it in your own life multiple times, right?"
"2286360","2288840"," They tell you what's going to happen and then it doesn't, right?"
"2289840","2294620"," The markets move on, the economy moves on, and you're paying more than you ever were. "
"2294620","2297760"," And you're actually getting less than you ever were as well, right?"
"2297940","2304060"," That's the insidiousness in the background that a lot of people don't get or want to talk about."
"2304360","2310440"," There's insidiousness in the background of you accepting less because you've never known better"
"2310440","2311980"," over time."
"2312560","2314460"," That goes from clothes, clothing, right?"
"2315320","2316480"," Not the type of clothing. "
"2317100","2322300"," Not cut jeans or cool t-shirts or whatever it is your fashion is, just the quality of it."
"2322920","2325400"," You can't buy Levi's."
"2325600","2329740"," The Levi's that I bought when I was a kid, I think they're $700 right now. "
"2330260","2333580"," And I think the low end of the jeans when I had one as a kid were, they're now 400."
"2334580","2335700"," Think about that for a minute."
"2336460","2346000"," Four to $700 for the pair of jeans today was not inflationary fucking even $100 when I was a kid. "
"2346980","2349740"," So there's an insidiousness underneath."
"2351120","2355020"," This goes right to you're going to pay for your everything in your house is going to be a service,"
"2355020","2355360"," right?"
"2355720","2357340"," Your dishwasher is going to be a service."
"2357720","2359340"," Your furnace is going to be a service. "
"2359900","2361380"," Your car heater is going to be a service."
"2361920","2365480"," It's a slow erosion everywhere."
"2367240","2369280"," And a lot of young people don't even notice. "
"2369520","2370280"," They're like, well, I like this."
"2370680","2372840"," Or this is, I find this is okay or good."
"2372840","2376940"," It's because they never knew better, right?"
"2377060","2379800"," They never knew or had the experience of equality. "
"2380120","2385500"," As a matter of fact, whatever I think is quality is probably not what a 70 year old thinks is"
"2385500","2385880"," quality."
"2386400","2393200"," I'd posit that that if a matter of fact when I was a kid, I remember that metals began to"
"2393200","2393560"," change."
"2393600","2400740"," A lot of people in trades, mechanics, anyone in like an actual trade would say nails suck today. "
"2401500","2402940"," Tools suck today."
"2403480","2407200"," There's no guarantee in tools lifetime guarantee craftsman, right?"
"2407440","2408260"," Let's see that shit anymore."
"2408940","2409860"," It's just gone, right?"
"2410760","2414420"," So even just even just the quality of what you're getting is degrading. "
"2415240","2422640"," Even this past week was a huge discussion on Reddit about there used to be a disparity between fine"
"2422640","2424360"," dining and fast food."
"2424740","2429060"," That disparity is getting closer and closer now where you might as well just get the fine dining,"
"2429060","2429460"," right?"
"2430080","2433680"," And a lot of circumstances, even if you're not eating as much, you could probably go there, get a"
"2433680","2439340"," couple drinks, get an appetizer, two, three, four small plates with your husband or whatever and"
"2439340","2445400"," get away roughly maybe 20 bucks, 40 bucks more than you would have prior to this inflationary up"
"2445400","2445700"," cycle."
"2451430","2453630"," Yeah, yeah, exactly. "
"2453870","2454730"," Chocolate bars, right?"
"2455070","2457070"," Shrinking chocolate bars, shrinking this, shrinking that."
"2457070","2461530"," I'm fine with some of that stuff, but the prices that are coming down with it, are they?"
"2463010","2465710"," So we're in this next cycle right now."
"2465710","2472170"," And regardless of what the Fed is telling you, regardless of the Fed is telling you, you see the"
"2472170","2473370"," proof in the background. "
"2474250","2475130"," I want you to know that."
"2475390","2476310"," Trust that about yourself."
"2476750","2484370"," One of the greatest parts about becoming a new investor is they usually go, new investors usually"
"2484370","2491970"," say, man, I remember that I remember that I was using this product and nobody else knew about it. "
"2492010","2492950"," Then the stock went to the moon."
"2493410","2497650"," Or my kids use this one thing and boom, now it's going to the moon in the stock market, right?"
"2499970","2509570"," So, you know, like this, you know, this stock market's probably really fucking cheap right now like"
"2509570","2512350"," even though they're not telling you, it's extremely cheap."
"2512850","2517270"," And it's likely going to become cheaper as time goes on, which means it has to go up in price. "
"2518870","2521170"," Oh, so Mike, Mike, I said something similar."
"2521390","2521630"," Okay."
"2522390","2522430"," Cool. "
"2524710","2525370"," It's tough."
"2525750","2528190"," So this week with Jerome, it's going to be difficult."
"2528390","2529310"," We have a challenge for him. "
"2529530","2534250"," I'm fascinated to see what he does tomorrow."
"2534250","2544110"," The, the, the zeit guess is that no rate hikes and he's going to be hawkish in tone,"
"2544110","2544590"," right?"
"2546030","2546930"," We'll look today."
"2547150","2552010"," We'll take a peek and see if we pause and hold for longer, which we've already front run some of"
"2552010","2552590"," that, right?"
"2553970","2558450"," And if he doesn't raise rates, again, how long during that pause period, what takes place?"
"2558730","2561350"," When do they begin that roll down kind of stuff?"
"2561530","2562110"," We'll take a peek at that. "
"2562110","2567610"," We'll take a look at the value of the stock market, right?"
"2568130","2571490"," And for PE ratios, it's quite low right now."
"2571550","2575450"," It's at the buy place that they're going to buy where gun lacking guys like that will buy it."
"2576610","2579530"," Even if we roll down, this is the place to buy. "
"2580590","2587110"," So some other, there's some stuff out there that's saying look for major higher prices out there in"
"2587110","2588130"," the coming years ahead."
"2591730","2592450"," Yeah, dude."
"2592730","2593530"," Duolingo, baby. "
"2594210","2594590"," Cranking."
"2595070","2595950"," It's one of our picks."
"2596290","2600310"," All those picks we have are now exploding to the upside, like all of them. "
"2600610","2603730"," Everyone we talked about this year is exploding into the end of the year."
"2604390","2605730"," They're booming right now."
"2605990","2606310"," Booming. "
"2609230","2610910"," No, your hands are not bigger."
"2611010","2611850"," Sunday never ends."
"2614310","2621180"," Yeah, and there's, so there's a part to this. "
"2621180","2628640"," I was talking to a friend about how, whatever you don't know, you don't know that it was better"
"2628640","2629060"," before."
"2631080","2637760"," So if I train you as a company to accept something and let's say I'm going through a cycle, a"
"2637760","2639080"," generational cycle, right?"
"2639260","2640860"," And I'm like, okay, all these old fucks over here."
"2640940","2641800"," They're never going to accept this. "
"2642440","2643820"," And they're going to bitch in wine, right?"
"2644080","2644500"," Bitch in wine."
"2644740","2647900"," But these kids, they're not going to bitch in wine like the old people."
"2647900","2653960"," And eventually, the old people are going to die off and stop, stop, stop getting angry and crying"
"2653960","2654740"," and all this other stuff. "
"2655120","2658140"," And now the kids will become the new adults, right?"
"2658620","2660040"," And they'll just say, this is what I expect."
"2660340","2664980"," And then as they cycle through these, this next generation, this next generation, of course, will"
"2664980","2668520"," become 40, 50, 60, 70 years old and bitch about what they're getting."
"2668980","2672940"," I noticed it when I was traveling to Asia when I was younger. "
"2674280","2674480"," I did."
"2674480","2678140"," I noticed like more tech, less quality."
"2678640","2682180"," And I could see the creep over the years here in the US being accepted. "
"2682460","2682920"," It's kind of wild."
"2684900","2687160"," Like they got electric bikes out there."
"2687300","2688280"," It was like, do electric bikes. "
"2688600","2689340"," So hold on a second here."
"2689780","2691940"," I'm going to keep my eyes on this area."
"2692480","2694420"," Take some money if I can at some point. "
"2694560","2695760"," See if we squeeze up higher here."
"2701330","2703010"," I mean, one quick second here."
"2705730","2710530"," I got to keep a box at 4650. "
"2712290","2714130"," I'm not sure we go this high, but."
"2717170","2717890"," That's right there."
"2717970","2718570"," We got plenty of room. "
"2719230","2726260"," I got this big old cell up here."
"2727940","2729480"," Leave that down there for you."
"2737950","2738350"," Okay. "
"2738490","2739810"," So you know about the white golf phase?"
"2740030","2741110"," There's no other crap, right?"
"2741350","2743990"," We're going to I'm going to the screen down below as we squeeze up here."
"2744470","2745750"," I'm going to show you guys a."
"2747990","2750130"," I'm going to show you guys something down here."
"2750130","2751550"," It's just going to be a quick second here. "
"2754160","2756340"," Then go to a one day chart here."
"2762330","2764230"," There's a man switch over briefly here."
"2764370","2765390"," Hold on one quick second. "
"2765550","2769670"," We're grind up and I give him a little bit of money, but none of this is grinding the whole"
"2769670","2770010"," way up."
"2770330","2771590"," We're going to hold it all day long again."
"2773530","2774450"," So these are. "
"2775730","2779250"," These are rate decisions, prior rate decisions going back."
"2779250","2782750"," I think I just did them to us February in here."
"2784150","2786510"," And we'll take a look at these rate decisions. "
"2786790","2789910"," Now the last these last three right here."
"2790790","2792270"," No rate hike."
"2794670","2798390"," Now we were selling down already into this rate hike, right?"
"2799230","2802770"," We were selling up or buying up into this rate hike right now. "
"2803690","2808650"," It's not it's not it's not an edge in any way, but you see that we're coming into a rate"
"2808650","2809030"," decision."
"2809030","2812470"," Would not be shocked to see us go up into this rate decision."
"2813370","2815230"," That's the track that we are on. "
"2816170","2817810"," If we get zero rate hike."
"2818670","2820770"," But then I'm also looking at."
"2821170","2822610"," Let's say we get up here. "
"2823930","2827750"," Do we come back down for that end of quarter in here."
"2828470","2830490"," That forty five one fifteen."
"2831430","2832350"," So be aware of that. "
"2832430","2835430"," If we come into this rate decision and we end up squeezing up."
"2836470","2843150"," Right maybe into next week after Friday and then we we break down into the end of year to forty"
"2843150","2844870"," five fifteen or."
"2845610","2852010"," If it's a no if if the rate hike is a is a is a nothing burger right we do"
"2852010","2853250"," the initial squeeze up. "
"2853830","2861470"," Come back down and then grind down into the thirty first and then you actually get your."
"2861470","2866990"," Your dip by that you're looking for or maybe you got a small Christmas rally and down right here."
"2867510","2872230"," Squeeze up and then down double top right here come back down into the into forty five fifteen. "
"2872730","2879730"," And then we're off and running for that actual January run February run without performance by IWM."
"2882170","2887530"," You should see decent performance out of S&P 500 and cues but not like IWM."
"2888270","2895450"," That would extend into likely March January be one one big point come back down for January and"
"2895450","2898170"," then go back up for another big pump into March. "
"2899070","2905370"," So just keep be aware of that as we trade down into no raises right we stay on trend."
"2906070","2911970"," So we should stay on trend if there's no raise into when's there at least the last few decisions"
"2911970","2914970"," that we've had that's been the case."
"2915370","2917350"," So we can glean that right there. "
"2917910","2922570"," Next thing that we're going to glean is where the next thing we're going to try to glean here is"
"2922570","2923510"," on the trigger screen."
"2924770","2934290"," We're then going to take a look at zip I think it's PE ratio."
"2934870","2936830"," Let's go take a look at this one and see if this is it. "
"2946390","2949250"," No wrong one hold on giving just a quick second here."
"2949250","2952670"," Unless I'm hiding stuff over here am I hiding stuff over here."
"2956320","2958100"," I'm not hiding anything am I nope. "
"2960000","2961360"," It might just be in the."
"2963240","2965320"," Oh maybe I'm just in the wrong thing am I."
"2967820","2970600"," On Ford PE ratio means I'm going to add this here."
"2982740","2984220"," I'm going to find this in here. "
"2994950","2998470"," Does that pop up anything over here I'm not showing the Ford PE ratio."
"3000090","3003870"," All right we'll come back to this one I usually bring this one up and I don't know where the"
"3003870","3004790"," fuck it is right now."
"3005850","3007530"," I'll come back to the PE ratio. "
"3009890","3012230"," Hold on a second really one more one more thing up here."
"3013970","3015750"," We're going to take a look at this JPM caller."
"3020850","3022150"," We're going to look at the JPM. "
"3022330","3024490"," I'll break come back to the PE ratio for you later."
"3026370","3027710"," On the JPM caller."
"3028470","3033070"," We have the squeeze up into I'm going to bring this make this larger for you. "
"3033270","3035750"," So traditionally on the JPM caller we're like a magnet."
"3036390","3039610"," Into the closest strike you can see it right here."
"3040130","3042290"," Right we blood blooded down right here. "
"3042710","3045630"," We're actually started magnetting the bottom one over here right."
"3045810","3046350"," It's pretty bad."
"3046350","3048090"," Imagine doing that into this. "
"3048990","3049930"," Into this."
"3050790","3051710"," Into this."
"3052930","3058750"," End of quarter though this began way before right we actually began this about just before halfway"
"3058750","3059510"," through this quarter. "
"3059570","3060770"," So not expecting that."
"3061190","3065770"," You can actually see though into this end of quarter as we got closer that quarter we had a magnet."
"3066810","3071290"," Andy Andy constant likes to call it the vortex see down here right into the end of the quarter"
"3071290","3073170"," sneak right back up right. "
"3073930","3076250"," I know everybody said we're going to crash down and it didn't happen."
"3077430","3082690"," Then come up here magnet down to the end of the quarter right down here down here and all of"
"3082690","3082910"," a sudden."
"3083050","3085470"," Into the quarter magnet to closest strike. "
"3085970","3092010"," So for right now for right now the closest strike for that magnet is that 45 15 right."
"3092690","3098050"," If we were to blast down here but get a little bit close to the end of the quarter we"
"3098050","3099430"," should magnet right here."
"3099850","3104850"," Make sense there is a possibility that if we were to bloodbath and reject. "
"3105470","3108190"," Like the 15th or so or 17th."
"3108670","3111870"," This could become the magnet believe it or not four zero five five."
"3112530","3114850"," So we have to watch that this is a very low probability. "
"3115610","3120850"," That we go down this deep but just remember that that we have a vortex on the 31st."
"3121470","3123910"," 45 15 okay 45 15."
"3124990","3130470"," Into end of quarter people will trade to that whether you like it's or not. "
"3130470","3135250"," You can kick and scream you can bitch and whine you can cry about it you can do whatever you"
"3135250","3135450"," want."
"3135690","3140570"," But I know for a fact that at some point heading into the end of the quarter about a week"
"3140570","3141510"," or two away from it."
"3141850","3145770"," They're going to be market participants with a lot of fucking money they're going to go. "
"3146450","3149690"," Where are we in price and where's 45 15."
"3150190","3152250"," Let's trade to it does it make sense."
"3152690","3159890"," So just be aware that there is a large large large money out there that is hyper aware of that. "
"3159890","3163970"," Vortex as Andy likes to call it into the end of quarter."
"3166310","3167930"," Hey, what's going on brother."
"3168250","3169050"," Have a great day at work. "
"3170990","3172070"," It's SPX."
"3173090","3177590"," Someone was asking this morning about why we're when I say 46 hundred and what am I speaking about."
"3178090","3181770"," Futures or Globex or SPX. "
"3182230","3185690"," If I don't say anything I just write 46 hundred that's SPX."
"3186370","3190630"," Always that's because that's because I pull the data from SPX."
"3190630","3194770"," It's the most complete data that I can get to run these models. "
"3194910","3198690"," Everyone else runs it off of this of the SPX data as well."
"3199350","3203670"," I find the best levels for day trading from ES though."
"3204330","3208630"," And nighttime trading for real levels I've supply and demand. "
"3209410","3210770"," ES is the clearest picture."
"3211010","3213910"," That's why we have the book map up and open on ES."
"3214510","3216590"," If you watch spy on book map. "
"3217150","3222950"," It has levels that the zeros in the fives for major buy sell orders."
"3223450","3226830"," So it's not as crystal clear as ES to watch."
"3227530","3229430"," One second I got a text coming in. "
"3232150","3238050"," Hang tight one quick second I got to answer this or at least read it."
"3242530","3243090"," Okay."
"3246650","3247610"," So what else. "
"3250490","3252030"," Okay, losing track track of thought."
"3252210","3261210"," So this is your JPM caller that you need to be aware of."
"3261490","3265110"," We're going to get back to that PE ratio though at some point because I think it's critical. "
"3266150","3272010"," The next thing we're going to look at here is going to be let's take a peek at spy really"
"3272010","3272350"," quick."
"3280240","3284140"," We're going to check out a five minute basis here for tomorrow."
"3289520","3292720"," Okay, I can bring this you guys can snap this and have this available. "
"3292720","3293260"," Okay."
"3294580","3297580"," Upside trend is this green."
"3297920","3300000"," It's got Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, right?"
"3301300","3302000"," Move this over here. "
"3303660","3304440"," Upward trend."
"3304860","3306280"," Okay, for bulls and bears."
"3306800","3309860"," I don't care if you're a buyer, sell whatever right now, right?"
"3310160","3310820"," We are trending up. "
"3311880","3314720"," We are every time we confirm the screen bar."
"3314860","3315240"," What do we do?"
"3315380","3316340"," We're bouncing right now."
"3316580","3321440"," So until we get underneath the screen bar, reject, right?"
"3321980","3322720"," Start to head lower. "
"3323540","3326020"," Come back up on that green bar comes down, right?"
"3326360","3327380"," Green bar goes right here."
"3328880","3330700"," Until this begins to happen."
"3331740","3333200"," Bulls are in charge. "
"3333700","3333840"," Okay."
"3335240","3335820"," Period."
"3336540","3337800"," Bulls are in charge. "
"3337800","3343500"," So as of right now, upside trend, we have low volatility right now, right?"
"3344480","3347180"," And we are we're low volatility and we're positive gamma."
"3348440","3354580"," So you're going to expect grinding sideways, upside moves and walls above."
"3355320","3360460"," You're not going to expect like big giant grinding or big giant squeezes, stuff like that. "
"3360980","3364340"," We were we were we traded this for how long how many sessions down here?"
"3364340","3367580"," 13, 14 sessions, then you got a big move, right?"
"3368160","3372920"," And then you're going to expect 13, 14 sessions or even maybe four."
"3373080","3375220"," Well, this week, it should be this week."
"3375280","3379660"," It should only be till Friday, but we have a pin in the market here. "
"3380540","3382480"," Roughly right here."
"3383900","3384460"," Okay."
"3384520","3388860"," So roughly right here, this green bar, we have tomorrow the event. "
"3390060","3392080"," We are kind of tied to this area."
"3392080","3396740"," Even if we have a bloodbath, we should come back up for a squeeze higher."
"3397000","3400140"," We should come back into this area to print a bunch of shit. "
"3400660","3405600"," We got so much gamma that's rolling off on this in this zone here."
"3406920","3409720"," 4600 4650 heading into Friday."
"3410760","3411860"," So here's your play area. "
"3412360","3413080"," We're down here."
"3413280","3413960"," We're buying the dip."
"3414140","3414480"," We're up here. "
"3414600","3415660"," We're selling the rip, right?"
"3416280","3421460"," Come into this event in here and you're either sitting on your hands or your day trade net, right?"
"3421720","3428380"," And cutting your longs or your shorts as we come down into these zones above and below."
"3428660","3435560"," If you see during the Jerome Powell rate decision, he tells you, yeah, I don't know."
"3435580","3440220"," We raised 25 BPS and we blast down our Nithi hourly trigger. "
"3440920","3445100"," And we begin to reject at any point into the close or we close below this thing."
"3445260","3447520"," Yeah, I'll give you the will go down farther later on."
"3447960","3449340"," All bets are off the table. "
"3449340","3453500"," We're going to torch all this shit or even go down and then swing back up and sneak up in"
"3453500","3454460"," here, right?"
"3454600","3457120"," They print all these calls worthless, right?"
"3457380","3457860"," On Friday."
"3459260","3460900"," So I'm aware of all this."
"3461020","3468320"," You should be aware of all this too into Friday that we are kind of tied right now into this"
"3468320","3469320"," market here. "
"3469720","3474560"," Now, if you do break down, we squeeze back up in a Friday to touch that."
"3474640","3476360"," We want to make some more downside moves."
"3476360","3480740"," Let's take a look at where the daily trigger is on spy. "
"3482500","3484120"," Just one quick second here."
"3494620","3497000"," 449.99. So let's call it 450."
"3508140","3509240"," Right down there. "
"3509420","3510340"," Just so you can see it."
"3510660","3513840"," I'm assuming we can get a snap for you guys up there."
"3514600","3518080"," If you're a bull, you want to get above this yellow box. "
"3519100","3523960"," If you're a bear or if you're a bull, you want to get above this yellow box."
"3523960","3530100"," If you're a bear, you are looking to get underneath this green box and reject."
"3530900","3535620"," You want to get underneath this green box. "
"3535620","3540460"," Begin to reject so you can begin to make the move down to that 450 to the downside."
"3540940","3542860"," Maybe even squeeze down below and come back up."
"3543960","3549960"," So you're trying to get underneath if you're a seller underneath currently 461 on spoos. "
"3549960","3556580"," 461 and some change on spoos underneath this 460 area somewhere down in here to get down to that"
"3556580","3557980"," 450 area."
"3558440","3560560"," Now some notes here I'm going to give to you."
"3561060","3561960"," One quick second here. "
"3566280","3569040"," Some notes that I'm going to give to you real quick in the background."
"3569840","3574100"," And I want you to write this down at home if you can."
"3575080","3577680"," I'm not going to post this on Fintuit right now. "
"3580900","3583080"," One quick second here."
"3585580","3594120"," At the money volatility for tomorrow's decreasing by 17.2% from 19.1%. The straddle is down from"
"3594120","3604040"," $37 to 42 from $237.77, $37.70 to $42.80. According to the Fed Fund's"
"3604040","3607220"," futures March contract, cut March remains off the table."
"3607220","3609260"," Here's the part where I want you to write down. "
"3610020","3616520"," When I write down SPX dealer gamma is 1050 million."
"3617100","3620240"," Gamma flip is at 4560."
"3621060","3623080"," So the gamma flip has come up right?"
"3624120","3626920"," The call wall is at 4700. "
"3627120","3633980"," So if you get above that 4600 which should after Friday, if we get no rate hike, right?"
"3633980","3641740"," As we come into Friday, the gamma wall at 4600 will break or weaken, and the door will be open"
"3641740","3642940"," to 4700."
"3643860","3651400"," Key strikes right now for you are 4600, 4625, 4650."
"3652140","3657300"," The zero date range right now for today is 4585, 4650. "
"3658120","3659960"," We're way below that right now."
"3661780","3668320"," The massive gamma imbalance will continue to restrict the free movements of the SPX until Friday,"
"3668360","3672200"," when about 400 m worth of gamma will expire."
"3673360","3680240"," And the range between 46 and 4650 seems plausible for this week, but that door will open to the"
"3680240","3683020"," upside once Friday comes to pass. "
"3683640","3686680"," Now that would, this, this includes any rate hikes."
"3687080","3694980"," If we get any rate hikes, if we get any rate hikes at all, you're going to see, you're going"
"3694980","3703300"," to write this down here, you're going to see, you're going to end up seeing us flip to negative"
"3703300","3705060"," gamma quite quickly."
"3707640","3711480"," So 4560, 4560, put that in there. "
"3712920","3714860"," That negative gamma in there for you."
"3716920","3718820"," Right about here."
"3720560","3724840"," Bring that down for you right now, and we'll just do this one more thing for you. "
"3724960","3726800"," Let me see if I can get that looking pretty for you, hold on."
"3729510","3731910"," Maybe this helps for you right there."
"3733370","3734630"," Hold on, bring this back. "
"3734830","3735050"," Hold on."
"3736410","3737350"," They don't want me to."
"3741830","3743550"," There's your negative gamma down here. "
"3744350","3745510"," We got this one down here."
"3745610","3747210"," This is for a previous trade here."
"3749450","3751930"," This is hourly trigger from way before. "
"3752710","3753970"," I want to say I'm going to clean that up for you."
"3756290","3758450"," So let's get rid of a bunch of this crap in here."
"3758630","3758810"," Hold on. "
"3759390","3760910"," Let's make this nice and clean for you."
"3760910","3764150"," Yeah, there's Valhalla up here."
"3764270","3769650"," This Valhalla, this is the door that's open to this 47 up here. "
"3777650","3778950"," So no rate hike, right?"
"3779230","3779570"," Come in here."
"3779810","3781290"," Trade this trade this next week."
"3781470","3782610"," Bam, looking for that up there. "
"3783630","3783990"," There's your 4700."
"3784630","3786050"," Get a rate hike and kind of doom and gloom."
"3786470","3789010"," Get down underneath this negative gamma, right?"
"3789930","3793290"," Swing back up for that Friday, but you're in negative gamma down here, right?"
"3793530","3793810"," Reject. "
"3794690","3796070"," And then boom, that's where it gets nasty."
"3797010","3798610"," Into next week to the downside."
"3802040","3804360"," Well, let me see if I bring this up a little bit for you. "
"3806220","3807980"," We'll just make this a red bar up here."
"3811330","3813530"," And then this is your daily trigger down below."
"3822350","3822730"," Oopsie. "
"3834800","3836140"," See if that helps you guys."
"3837880","3839540"," Let's just get rid of all this crap here."
"3842680","3844840"," These are all previous highs that I'm watching. "
"3846780","3847660"," So there you go."
"3847740","3849940"," That's what you need to know into tomorrow."
"3850640","3853620"," I'm going to quickly get back to the main screen here. "
"3853720","3858480"," And I'm going to then chart out for you the expected moves on spy tomorrow."
"3870400","3871480"," You want a quick second here."
"3893380","3895780"," So spy expected downside today. "
"3895780","3896960"," For the 13th, the upside expected move is for 65, 39."
"3896960","3898480"," The options market pricing in for 61, 23 upside."
"3899260","3902140"," Options market is pricing in for 63, 50. "
"3902720","3908120"," For the 13th, the upside expected move is for 65, 39."
"3908880","3911760"," The options market pricing in for 65, 39."
"3912360","3914100"," That's that upside target of for 65. "
"3914480","3915540"," We talked about all morning, right?"
"3915540","3920520"," The downside expected move tomorrow for 59, 28."
"3920880","3924540"," So if everything comes in as as expected, right?"
"3925420","3926900"," You got all the talking heads out there."
"3926900","3928640"," You got people out there talking, right?"
"3929400","3931280"," You get the you get the fed. "
"3931540","3932380"," No rate increase."
"3932640","3935420"," You get the fed with the firm talking to the slapping in the fed."
"3935920","3942180"," The expected range for tomorrow is for 65, 39, 49, 28. "
"3942840","3947200"," Heading into heading into Thursday and Friday, though."
"3947420","3956940"," We have range expansion for 67, 35 on spy and downside for 57, 66."
"3957000","3962580"," And from there, we get some pretty big range expansion to the up and down side. "
"3962720","3963980"," So be aware of that as well."
"3964140","3969980"," We've got a real tight range compression heading into into tomorrow's rate decision."
"3970600","3978200"," So I might be waiting for that rate decision to be making any conviction trades that you want to"
"3978200","3978840"," put on permanently. "
"3979840","3986540"," You might expect to squeeze up and then a pullback for you to actually buy in the 15th for that"
"3986540","3993320"," run up into the new year or even a blast down for a dip to buy for that Santa rally"
"3993320","3997780"," that you're looking for holiday rally that you're looking for or sell down."
"3997780","4003780"," So if we squeeze up into end of year, I'd be looking to short this shit into the 31st."
"4004780","4011220"," So if you're an investor or a seller, if you're making big plans as to where we go, they're not"
"4011220","4014560"," even talking about the IV crush unless you're getting spreads or something. "
"4015160","4020920"," It might be prudent for you to sit on your hands heading into tomorrow's rate decision so you can"
"4020920","4027960"," get a nice place to buy a dip or even a nice place to short the market if it excludes"
"4027960","4031860"," all of the lotto trades and all of that kind of stuff."
"4035220","4037260"," Yeah, I brought the gray love bar back, by the way."
"4037720","4039040"," I did bring the gray love bar back. "
"4039760","4046280"," I figured, my question was, are we going to, this morning, I was like, if we start selling, if they"
"4046280","4051440"," can break through that 4600, they love that fucking gray love bar to sell off of."
"4051580","4053680"," So I put it on this morning for you, so you'd have it."
"4059600","4060760"," Hold on one seconder. "
"4063580","4067860"," Did you guys see, I posted about a put back spread on Twitter this morning."
"4068880","4075040"," And then like three hours later, CNBC professional put out the put back trade."
"4075640","4076360"," I thought that was great. "
"4076860","4079660"," I was like, who the fuck is watching me from CNBC?"
"4080620","4085900"," Like three hours later, they posted fucking their favorite trade for this."
"4086260","4087320"," And that's a put back spread."
"4088040","4089880"," And I was like, fuck yeah, CNBC go. "
"4092440","4094280"," What else do I have for you this morning?"
"4094640","4095439"," I think that's it."
"4095620","4104359"," I mean, if you guys want to talk briefly about what to expect tomorrow, trade it up into the open"
"4104359","4104720"," tomorrow."
"4105340","4106180"," And then what do we do?"
"4106340","4108520"," We short it down for the, well, we know what they do. "
"4108620","4109439"," I forgot this."
"4109439","4110420"," I almost forgot this."
"4110700","4113260"," So they squeeze it up tomorrow in the opening bell, right?"
"4113840","4117740"," They trap you and then they short it down for like an hour or two. "
"4118100","4119140"," You're all locked in."
"4119300","4120359"," Your fucking calls are burned."
"4120640","4122800"," And then we squeeze up leading up into the rate decision. "
"4123640","4129220"," Of course, we, if you don't know this, you've got a, you've got the rates, a decision that's"
"4129220","4129420"," released."
"4129979","4135620"," And then you have the, then you have the interviews where he's got us tie on."
"4135720","4137720"," And you find out if he's going to break up the stupid charts. "
"4137720","4138120"," Hold on."
"4138120","4141140"," Your production in 2024 is forecast at 13."
"4141439","4142380"," What's going on?"
"4142520","4143120"," These guys today. "
"4143260","4146020"," Compared to 13 spot one, five million boughs per day."
"4146080","4147260"," Turn that down a little bit."
"4147380","4149319"," Like decrease from the EIA Steel report. "
"4149960","4152380"," So 2023 output estimated at tour spot."
"4152560","4153000"," Oh, I was saying."
"4153180","4156300"," A million boughs per day up slightly from the top. "
"4156920","4157600"," Jesus Christ."
"4158460","4159580"," I tried to pause it."
"4159660","4160439"," It wouldn't even let me pause. "
"4161340","4168260"," So the idea here, just being that when you go into tomorrow, I want you to realize a couple of"
"4168260","4168439"," things."
"4168560","4169880"," We're going to talk about those couple of things."
"4170100","4170200"," Okay. "
"4171020","4172660"," So we're going to get, we're going to drill down here."
"4172720","4177520"," We're going to drill down into a, we're going to drill down into normally what happens."
"4177520","4180899"," Not guaranteed here, but normally what happens. "
"4181439","4183779"," Should see a move to the upside in tomorrow."
"4184500","4186840"," Or that move is like that or like that."
"4187300","4187620"," Right?"
"4188220","4190160"," You're going to come out here looking all bullish and crazy. "
"4190260","4192460"," You're going to be foaming at the mouth or whatever."
"4192819","4194660"," And you're going to start just like this."
"4194660","4196360"," And normally they'll smack you down. "
"4197060","4199460"," We'll get to like 11 o'clock or so, 1130."
"4199940","4204000"," Start running it back up into the initial, into the initial report."
"4205340","4206580"," Into the initial report. "
"4207040","4208700"," Now we get that initial report."
"4209300","4211380"," We know that there's a ceiling of some kind."
"4212520","4214180"," That four sixty five and change. "
"4215220","4215260"," Right?"
"4216680","4220420"," We know that on the downside, there's some kind of a bottom in here."
"4222520","4226540"," Tomorrow has some kind of a bottom, let's be raises or something like that."
"4227060","4230340"," And what I want you to remember is that, let's say we do this. "
"4230440","4231860"," Let's just say we squeeze up."
"4232740","4234000"," They trap you in here."
"4235040","4235280"," Right?"
"4235460","4237120"," They get you right in the middle of this range. "
"4238540","4238940"," Right?"
"4240360","4244760"," And even if they front run this up for the, for the two p.m. before the, even if they"
"4244760","4247060"," run this up to the two p.m. Rate decision."
"4247420","4247940"," Let's say, right?"
"4248060","4248760"," You get to squeeze up."
"4248760","4252140"," Normally what they'll do is they'll snap it back before you get over it. "
"4253080","4258340"," And that's dealers that are murdering your calls and murdering with, uh, murdering the, uh, IV."
"4259980","4261420"," And re-pricing options."
"4261860","4263180"," So make sure you get out quickly. "
"4263280","4265540"," Like you get out here, even if we're going to go higher."
"4266080","4267900"," And you got to rebuy zero dates."
"4267900","4269420"," Again, if we are going to go higher. "
"4269700","4270560"," Same thing on the downside."
"4270860","4272460"," You should see like a blast down."
"4273240","4277460"," The immediate pullback up, they'll reprice puts and you're like, oh, yeah, we're going down. "
"4277640","4279140"," And you're like, yeah, you're still upside down, buddy."
"4279580","4280660"," They repriced your shit."
"4280660","4281060"," You're fucked. "
"4281440","4287320"," So you have two, three, four trades tomorrow."
"4287980","4291500"," You have two, three, possibly even four re-pricings."
"4292260","4295580"," You've got the guaranteed, you got like a upside move in the right decision. "
"4295740","4297980"," If it's positive for you, it gets pulled back down and you get the second one."
"4298200","4299300"," Then they pull it back down again."
"4299680","4300160"," That's one, two. "
"4300160","4306640"," And then you've got the interview or the presser, the Q&A session with a little bit more volatility"
"4306640","4307680"," down here, right?"
"4308460","4310780"," And then you actually get your move tomorrow to the upside."
"4311260","4314660"," So just be, don't be trading your whole entire account."
"4315640","4321680"," Don't be trading your entire account on, don't be trading your entire fucking account on this"
"4321680","4322040"," event. "
"4323120","4328980"," Now, if you want to do a put spread or call spread, ratio spread, whatever, you're going to fucking"
"4328980","4329220"," butterfly."
"4329220","4334980"," If you're selling straddles, that's where I was going over this big, there's a big trade out there"
"4334980","4335960"," that's getting eaten alive."
"4336880","4339000"," They're a straddle, I don't know if you know this. "
"4339440","4346920"," You guys may or may not know this, I saw, I saw Jenna Marcus early in the week commenting on"
"4346920","4347040"," it."
"4347160","4349020"," Nobody picked up, but I got like five fucking likes."
"4349660","4350780"," There's a large trade. "
"4351220","4357140"," Every time I come into these events, smart traders will sell straddles on this event and they're"
"4357140","4361240"," getting fucking smoked right now on these moves higher right now."
"4361720","4365800"," They're getting beaten up badly and they're just begging for price to come back down."
"4370510","4372230"," Oh, yeah, they're plagiarizing me. "
"4372810","4373370"," I'm being watched."
"4373610","4374510"," I don't already know I am."
"4374770","4378550"," I've been known this for a while, so I plagiarized though. "
"4378810","4380390"," I steal shit from people all the time."
"4380790","4381610"," I try to give credit."
"4381830","4384470"," Sometimes I forget, but I think that's part of what we do, right?"
"4384610","4385710"," I don't think it's a bad thing either. "
"4386650","4388690"," I don't, I don't mind if you plagiarize me."
"4388810","4391430"," If you guys ever plagiarize me and don't give me credit, I'm fine with it."
"4391930","4392970"," I got no problem with it. "
"4393070","4393670"," We're fucking retailers."
"4395030","4400350"," If we're, if anything, if anything, right, if you guys out there, I've heard people in the past say"
"4400350","4403430"," that guy's plagiarized, never to me, but I've heard people say it out of other people."
"4403590","4404570"," I'm like, I don't give a fuck. "
"4405450","4406150"," We're retailers."
"4406750","4410570"," You can't be plagiarizing us unless you're a fucking bank, right?"
"4411030","4415330"," I don't like when banks plagiarize us like during GME when they went into all the social media and"
"4415330","4416210"," figured all that shit out."
"4416530","4417610"," That pisses me off. "
"4418150","4422550"," Retailers help each other out fucking, not only help each other out, but disseminate the"
"4422550","4428170"," information, push it, and then, and make sure that enough people get that information right or"
"4428170","4428450"," wrong."
"4428810","4430050"," Do retailers need information?"
"4430150","4431950"," So I got no problem with it."
"4438050","4443770"," So so my point here stands, okay, my point here stands with, let me get this up for you guys,"
"4444750","4447690"," my point here stands with you on tomorrow. "
"4448810","4452890"," I'll tell you what, man, if you're like a, if you're, we're, we're going to go back, I'm going to"
"4452890","4456470"," bring up another chart here in a minute, we're going to look at, we're going to take a, we're going"
"4456470","4459030"," to have a chit chat about, somebody just brought up a 10 year, we're going to have a chit chat"
"4459030","4464830"," about when the twos and tens matter, when they don't, how they're an awful fucking indicator,"
"4465690","4473550"," please, I've been saying this for years now, please, please, you're either going to fucking lose"
"4473550","4479090"," all your money, or you're going to come around to what captain tells you on this, stop fucking"
"4479090","4480150"," using the twos and tens."
"4481910","4486350"," It's used by subsellers to write a fucking narrative."
"4487150","4488290"," Sometimes it matters. "
"4489090","4490030"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"4490210","4496730"," It's right about 60 to 70% of the time, very poor indicator for where the market's going."
"4496730","4503050"," You're best, especially on a macro scale, a macro scale, your best indicators are typically the"
"4503050","4509810"," unemployment rates, rate of unemployment, to a very smaller extent, the jobs numbers. "
"4512690","4519070"," So unemployment, unemployment, unemployment, unemployment can't, number one, unemployment, every"
"4519070","4526330"," person you see for the rest of your life, unemployment is why the market goes up and down to a"
"4526330","4528250"," lesser extent, jobs as well."
"4528450","4535010"," They can amplify or give us a goldilocks that they can, they can really, they really do impact that"
"4535010","4536730"," what employment numbers mean."
"4537350","4542070"," Your second one is always going to be a fed funds rate. "
"4542510","4549530"," Your third one is going to be inflation and where inflation is, the direction of inflation of its"
"4549530","4558530"," heading down, and also when it hits support or resistance, okay, so inflation matters the direction"
"4558530","4560150"," and when it bounces."
"4560750","4564890"," As a matter of fact, you should see an inflation bounce and a fed fund rate cut in an employment"
"4565450","4572290"," right around six to eight percent for that to trigger major macro moves in our stock market."
"4572850","4580390"," Now, two's and tens, two's and threes, they matter, but not like, if they're aligned with those"
"4580390","4585650"," other things, sure, they can matter, but on their own, out there on their own, they are a very"
"4585650","4593650"," fucking poor way to make decisions for a macro thesis for an investor or trader out there. "
"4593870","4597690"," I'm sorry, it really is, so historically it is as well."
"4598270","4601190"," We've shown that on the show time and time again."
"4602070","4608350"," So I can't, I don't mind using it as like a, like a third rate tool, like I've got my"
"4608350","4613390"," hammer, I got my fucking nail, I got my wood, and I don't know, some kid wants to hold the"
"4613390","4618430"," nail for me, sure, but I looking for that kid, I can put that fucking nail on my own hand"
"4618430","4624210"," and swing that fucking hammer with a much higher degree of accuracy than some kid holding that nail"
"4624210","4624610"," for me. "
"4624610","4626250"," Is that best, the best way to describe it, maybe?"
"4626890","4628810"," So that's the stuff you should be looking for."
"4633390","4639550"," Come on, dude, fucking print me, dude, seriously, all day long yesterday, do I have to wait"
"4639550","4649350"," yesterday till the fucking close, looking Christ, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, we'll keep this over"
"4649350","4649770"," here too."
"4649910","4653390"," You've got this target up here, you guys already know the rules. "
"4654190","4656370"," All right, got that bad boy right there."
"4656370","4658610"," You got another couple of little sneaky peeks over here."
"4658610","4660350"," Let's see, we also got a little gap right here. "
"4660910","4663730"," We'll draw it a little yellow one right in there."
"4666510","4667770"," Make this one yellow."
"4673360","4675300"," Bring that puppy over right there. "
"4675780","4678740"," There you go."
"4679800","4681500"," So you can see it right there."
"4685780","4687740"," Okay, so tomorrow's right decision. "
"4688860","4692980"," Well, let's chat about that before we get into the all the macro shit."
"4695520","4701760"," Remember, we are pricing in, remember this, we are pricing in no rate hike."
"4702400","4705540"," We're pricing in a dad's come home. "
"4706060","4707780"," We had to set a party, dad's coming home."
"4708560","4713480"," Dad is going to attempt to do one of two things likely if there's no rate increase."
"4714140","4721540"," He either gets really hawkish in his tone, like higher for longer and more than likely more rate"
"4721540","4722020"," increases. "
"4722840","4726080"," Where we are, that's likely fucking bullshit."
"4726980","4729940"," And he's likely going to get called on it by the market."
"4730680","4731080"," Okay. "
"4732600","4739240"," If the Fed pulls out, if he comes out and he does a victory lap, that would be unexpected."
"4740480","4746100"," Okay, so the Fed Chair comes out, he's got a green tie on, and he's like mission accomplished, we"
"4746100","4746540"," did it."
"4747340","4749440"," That is very dumish. "
"4750140","4755260"," Be careful of that if you're a seller for an upside, crazy upside move."
"4756220","4761280"," If we get 25 BPS tomorrow, that is highly unexpected."
"4762240","4765760"," Why would we get a 25 BPS rate hike?"
"4766420","4774700"," I'm going to tell you, it would stop the machine from pricing in, maybe a"
"4774700","4784600"," little bit more two months before that price, for that cutting of rates"
"4784600","4787100"," comes into being a reality. "
"4787980","4791900"," Trust me on this stuff, guys, our fucking whole entire fucking market is traded."
"4792840","4795620"," Guys are building me since the beginning, we've traded this market together, right?"
"4795740","4799260"," We've projected all this shit and it's all come to fruition, right?"
"4800160","4803000"," We already talked about the rate cuts starting by October."
"4803300","4808760"," I saw the fucking articles yesterday, but everybody's saying expect rate cuts by October, then to"
"4808760","4814560"," one up on each other saying by May, talked about the weakness in February and April, talked about"
"4814560","4819260"," chasing, talked about the unemployment rate, tracking 6%. "
"4819660","4823000"," Then they gave up bullshit unemployment rate this past week."
"4823240","4825320"," That was a fucking lie, what they gave."
"4826220","4828720"," I'm telling you right now, that unemployment rate was a fucking lie. "
"4829320","4835240"," We're tracking up and to the right to that 6% 8% into the end of fucking December next"
"4835240","4835500"," year."
"4835980","4837320"," That's what we're doing right now."
"4837540","4843220"," I always love what they fucking tell us and then what's real. "
"4843900","4845920"," It takes 5 seconds to find this shit."
"4846560","4857210"," Well, so I think for me from his perspective, if"
"4857210","4865010"," there was a time where the internal cogs of the machine are going to price in a bunch of shit"
"4865010","4869290"," in six to 12 months, this is his last fucking chance."
"4870190","4875350"," I even think if he raised in three months or in January, it doesn't fucking matter. "
"4877410","4878370"," He's going to trigger."
"4879230","4879870"," He already has."
"4880010","4881590"," You can see it in price in the stock market. "
"4881750","4883210"," You can see it in price in the 9WM."
"4883370","4885750"," All this shit is being front-ran right now."
"4886090","4893250"," It's all being fucking front-ran right now, so those cogs are already turning and if he doesn't do"
"4893250","4896150"," anything, those cogs are going to speed up into next year. "
"4896370","4902050"," So he's telling you that this is what's going on."
"4902230","4905050"," So I'll tell you my personal preference."
"4905530","4911230"," I hope I take my trader cap off, put my main street hat on. "
"4912170","4915010"," I hope the fucking god they raised 25 BPS tomorrow."
"4916230","4921130"," That's not my trainer, it's just my, if you don't want this country to go where the fuck it's"
"4921130","4929110"," going, please, please Jerome Paul, if you're out there listening, one of your minions is listening"
"4929110","4931730"," right now, fucking do it, man."
"4932090","4933970"," Like seriously, just fucking do it. "
"4934130","4944410"," Even if you send us into a recession, I'm not anti this soft landing, but it results in out"
"4944410","4945990"," of fucking control prices."
"4946570","4947890"," Like it's going to get stupid."
"4948530","4951930"," We're greedy, I'm a greedy man, I'm a greedy motherfucker. "
"4952810","4958390"," And if you want to turn that greed on Jerome Paul, I'll run with it with you."
"4958990","4965090"," But I'm telling you that he's going to fail and declare victory, if he's going to declare victory"
"4965090","4971530"," or pause with hawkish language and then come out with bullshit inflation numbers and bullshit"
"4971530","4978710"," around the election, that fucking pisses me off as a bob on main street hat."
"4979410","4985070"," To be honest with you, I'd be fucking outraged if I was not a stock market participant. "
"4986230","4990750"," I'd be angry for what it spells for us down the road."
"4992070","4999070"," But I'm with the expectation, I'm with pause hawkish language, threats, all that kind of stuff, but"
"4999070","5003190"," the mechanics in the background, I told you guys the fucking mechanics would be two rate decisions"
"5003190","5007670"," ago, when he pulled out all that bullshit maps and all the fucking charts that were 30 years out"
"5007670","5011310"," and shit, I was like, that shit is not going to go over well."
"5011530","5016670"," And we're standing here right now, a couple months later, and you can see where we are in price. "
"5018070","5020590"," So that was a bad fucking move by him."
"5020790","5025510"," He triggered that shit, he triggered where we are right fucking now by doing all that stupid shit."
"5026770","5030570"," I hope that fuck they, it's your own pile, if you're, but if you're a mini, when you're tiny little"
"5030570","5035330"," minions out there, listen, I hope the fuck they fired that asshole, who told you to do that shit. "
"5035470","5039690"," AI, where the fuck told you to run that program during that last rate decision, you're out of your"
"5039690","5042110"," fucking mind, man, you're the president of the fucking Federal Reserve."
"5043150","5044110"," Fuck's wrong with you, man."
"5044490","5045290"," You don't have to do that shit. "
"5045430","5046790"," You put that off in your minions."
"5047770","5051390"," You're the guy that just goes out there and tells you, you know, yes, no, we're going here, we're"
"5051390","5051790"," going there."
"5052290","5056090"," Leaders don't fucking come out there with 30 goddamn charts, 10, 20 years out. "
"5056530","5057710"," All right, you're fucking mine, man."
"5058570","5062490"," Oh, yeah, dude, I'm fucking yelling."
"5062630","5063450"," I don't want to talk about yelling. "
"5064210","5065350"," Look at yelling, dude."
"5065890","5067950"," Coming into R1 right now, be careful here."
"5068090","5072990"," There's a little small bump right here, a little road block right where we are. "
"5073130","5075350"," If you look down below, you'll see we're coming to R1 right now."
"5078090","5080590"," It's squeezing up higher right now, not paying it on today."
"5080710","5082250"," They're paying, but it's not like they should be. "
"5082390","5085590"," So it's the grind, baby."
"5085690","5086550"," We're in the grind today."
"5086630","5089630"," Just grind it up, grind it up, grind it up, grind it up. "
"5090130","5090810"," Slow grind."
"5091110","5091750"," Here's a penny boss."
"5092070","5093970"," Thanks to the fucking penny. "
"5094470","5095490"," Fuck you two dealers."
"5099010","5101330"," Let me whip out my iPad."
"5101770","5102250"," Dude, you know what?"
"5102250","5103490"," I think the iPad was bad. "
"5104190","5104670"," Fuck the iPad."
"5105410","5107490"," Like when he did the charts, I was like, that's it."
"5107650","5107870"," I'm out. "
"5108070","5109150"," I'm fucking done right now."
"5109530","5111530"," I thought the charts were bad."
"5117940","5118960"," I got to take my portfolio. "
"5118960","5119560"," Hold on here."
"5131960","5132840"," Hold on here."
"5133000","5135060"," As we squeeze up here, I'm going to close some of this shut up. "
"5135200","5136560"," Looking for that yellow bar up there."
"5139980","5140740"," Come on, dude."
"5141040","5142000"," Squeeze it off. "
"5148290","5148990"," Squeeze it off."
"5149130","5149910"," Squeeze it off, dude."
"5159290","5161750"," Okay, so, sorry. "
"5161750","5164930"," Hey, no, I know."
"5165130","5167250"," It's like fucking print this shit."
"5167670","5171010"," I'm looking to sell like right here. "
"5171450","5172210"," Pretty close."
"5172550","5174710"," I know you guys always call me Captain fucking."
"5175170","5175910"," What do you guys call me?"
"5176010","5176650"," Captain Paperhands?"
"5177450","5179690"," But I want to jump back in. "
"5179750","5182030"," If we can like do that and then come back in and do that."
"5183730","5186530"," Come on back down here and grab that right there."
"5188510","5190290"," Let's keep your eyes on that right now. "
"5190290","5192350"," Guys, like make a money with me, right?"
"5198090","5201150"," So I don't know what to say about tomorrow."
"5202350","5204950"," I really do hold 25 BPS."
"5205670","5206010"," I'm begging. "
"5206350","5208270"," You're out there and you know Jerome Powell."
"5209050","5209890"," Fucking begging you, man."
"5210230","5210390"," Please. "
"5211770","5214230"," I don't want to see my kids having to go through that."
"5214590","5215190"," I really don't."
"5215870","5219190"," I really, really fucking don't want to see my kids going through that. "
"5226060","5227800"," Yeah, Jay Shaney just said it right."
"5227980","5235000"," Jay Shaney just said quote, we remain committed to our goal to get to 2% inflation and are ready"
"5235000","5238580"," to take the necessary statements to get there for the one millionth time."
"5239020","5241880"," Maybe Powell shouldn't wait a way to wait in one year too long to start hiking. "
"5241880","5243760"," He's so over his head."
"5245520","5246620"," Yeah, I can see that."
"5246780","5247780"," Jimmy Barry's in the house. "
"5248680","5250400"," I always trust Jimmy Barry."
"5250560","5253080"," Let's see what he's saying right now and read what someone he's saying."
"5253740","5257920"," Just a note, Captain Spias completed its December 15th pricing, which was 462. "
"5258600","5262100"," So next levels are either 462 or 452."
"5263220","5267880"," All eyes should be on the B.O.J. Japan will trigger a global collapse if they start moving rates."
"5268720","5271800"," Japan's exports are fading and they are recession tipping point. "
"5272380","5273900"," But for now, so many people are short."
"5274140","5276500"," The market will continue to squeeze up until it doesn't."
"5277340","5282600"," Barry is also pointing out these global markets fundamentally are moving up on massive debt levels. "
"5282820","5284140"," I agree with that too, Jimmy."
"5285460","5287240"," Jimmy, I'm really scared before I get to this."
"5287400","5289120"," I haven't read the rest of what Jimmy said at this point. "
"5289220","5294540"," Jimmy, I'm fucking watching global oil like a fucking hawk right now."
"5295120","5296760"," I don't want to see it break below 70."
"5297020","5300840"," I don't want to see it break down into the 60s, 50s, any of that craziness. "
"5301640","5302700"," And that is a tip."
"5302940","5306200"," For me, that's what I'm watching for that global recession."
"5307600","5312140"," These global markets fundamentally are moving up on massive debt levels, which is not good for the"
"5312140","5312420"," future. "
"5312800","5316580"," And as I've been saying for a while, the housing market will be the catalyst."
"5317860","5320480"," Pre-market highs could be tested at 464."
"5320940","5325020"," Powell will say as long as, oh, Jimmy, I want to say thanks for writing all this, man. "
"5325520","5329860"," Powell will say as long as that employment numbers are strong, rates will stay higher for longer."
"5330420","5333900"," But I do not see any rate cuts only rate rises into next year."
"5333900","5338540"," The sole reason the market has not dumped is the positioning of so many shorts. "
"5339280","5343240"," So we do not go down until positions switch to longs."
"5345360","5351300"," Well, David AMS is asking is the if the mention anything about QTQE can be bullish."
"5352180","5355300"," Jimmy says personally earnings will call the feds bluff. "
"5356140","5358100"," I should be on the bank of Japan."
"5365700","5366480"," I do watch the dude."
"5366600","5368960"," Remember when he rolled out those charts, Sparky?"
"5369060","5371420"," I was like, I had a fucking meltdown when he did that shit. "
"5372380","5374420"," Now, there is something here."
"5374520","5377300"," I think that David might have been touching on this."
"5377340","5377940"," I'm not sure. "
"5379000","5387040"," Now, if we pause and the market were to actually believe he's going to raise again, this is the"
"5387040","5388040"," outsider thing."
"5389100","5394420"," If he pauses and the market believes him that he's going to raise again, they believe the market."
"5395080","5396240"," There's a couple of things here. "
"5397060","5398280"," A couple outsider things."
"5399700","5404660"," A couple of outside things that I want you to not bet on, but I want you to think about."
"5407020","5412760"," If he pauses and maybe he announces a rate to sit the next, maybe he says, hey, we're going to"
"5412760","5414300"," have a rate decision in January. "
"5414940","5420820"," He tells you that because they can make them in January, February, March, wherever he tells you, he"
"5420820","5421680"," can make him some fucking rate."
"5421780","5424640"," If he tells you, like, see comes to the meeting goes, we're going to have another one in January, a"
"5424640","5426080"," meeting, rate decision."
"5426440","5428080"," And we're going to raise higher for longer. "
"5429940","5437500"," We could have an initial pullback, right, of bearishness and continue on like we have in 2022,"
"5438100","5439460"," 2023."
"5440200","5446820"," That would be a sideways and up grind with normal pullbacks, normal corrections, that kind of"
"5446820","5447100"," stuff."
"5448220","5455220"," That's, you can see those periods took place in the 50s, 60s, I think it was the 60s and 70s. "
"5455580","5460160"," I think it was maybe the end of the 50s, but that those Volcker years, what we ended up doing"
"5460160","5462860"," was we ground, or we traded sideways."
"5463740","5467660"," It's like a stagflation type of an environment where we slowly go up."
"5467940","5475760"," You're looking for corrective moves like the lows in May and the lows in October, like the low we"
"5475760","5477640"," just had, you're going to buy those. "
"5477840","5478520"," We'll trade them up."
"5478680","5479660"," We'll slam a new hike."
"5479660","5480940"," I'm right back down again. "
"5481460","5482520"," That is an option."
"5482980","5487600"," I don't know that the market participant or that the big market participant is going to believe"
"5487600","5488180"," this though."
"5488960","5494080"," And you can see the mechanics of it that they don't believe it right now, but that is an option. "
"5494500","5499040"," Another option here, another really outside option here."
"5500000","5506480"," This is the one that is, this is the one that is a very low probability, but when it can"
"5506480","5509720"," matter when it does, and that is the bond vigilantes."
"5511040","5519320"," If there's a group of people, a very small group of liquidity providers and business magnets and"
"5519320","5521800"," leaders that everyone listens to. "
"5522820","5530580"," And these guys, if these guys aren't happy with this whole thing, if they're like, yeah, fuck you"
"5530580","5537800"," in your soft landing, like basically fuck you in your soft landing, they can step in and sell the"
"5537800","5543760"," fuck out of this market, real money, and bloodbath this shit into the depths of hell."
"5544060","5547420"," That's an outside very small chance, but that is a possibility."
"5547980","5552860"," You heard me earlier pitching and whining about what my main street hat wants. "
"5553360","5555860"," Those people want that too, to some extent."
"5556480","5558940"," They love the sideways and up market."
"5559380","5563060"," They don't want to see markets that go out of control. "
"5563680","5567600"," They don't like seeing the 2001s and the 2008s."
"5567800","5568760"," They don't like that shit."
"5569520","5574180"," Those people, if they're to step in, there's a possibility they could have a hand on the market"
"5574180","5579660"," that we don't see that we have that actual second leg down like we did in those years. "
"5580260","5583560"," So I'd be paying attention to that as well, and a very low probability."
"5588180","5593140"," Oh yeah, cap, did I see that Congress wants to ban Wall Street, B of A and et cetera, hedge"
"5593140","5595380"," funds from purchasing homes."
"5595540","5596820"," I'm going to let you guys in on a secret. "
"5597800","5599540"," Okay, you ready?"
"5600380","5600920"," Real simple secret."
"5602020","5607740"," The more rules you make, the easier it is for me to do what I want to do."
"5608600","5609080"," Does that make sense?"
"5610060","5612160"," Our country is founded upon that. "
"5612800","5616900"," The more rules you make, the more money I can make."
"5617720","5619280"," I'll say I'll leave it to that, okay?"
"5619800","5622240"," I doubt that's in your best interest in time."
"5622900","5625620"," I doubt there is not a way to get around that. "
"5626260","5626680"," I do."
"5626960","5629160"," I really doubt that there is a way to get around that."
"5631340","5633780"," And not only that, I did see it. "
"5634060","5636240"," It's more than likely about election season."
"5636600","5640020"," But even if it was to pass, the more rules, the better."
"5640340","5641060"," Same with taxes. "
"5642040","5644460"," Not a phrase, but your tax attorney will tell you that."
"5645220","5646100"," CPAs will tell you that."
"5646400","5647320"," Bookkeepers will tell you that. "
"5647740","5648680"," The more rules, the better."
"5648920","5651860"," Well, as long as you're working within the rules, you can make money."
"5652340","5653740"," Does that make sense in any way, shape or form?"
"5653860","5655080"," I don't know if it does or doesn't. "
"5658330","5659310"," Yeah, we can look you up."
"5659390","5664210"," You want to see the, you guys want to, I showed it yesterday briefly."
"5664210","5665430"," You guys want to see some cool shit?"
"5665630","5665910"," Hold on. "
"5667170","5668210"," Hold on one second here."
"5670510","5671850"," You guys want to see some coolness?"
"5676940","5681070"," I got some coolness for you."
"5681150","5681490"," Hold on here. "
"5686250","5688110"," Is this not, but they take this down again?"
"5688930","5690090"," Might have taken this down."
"5692210","5693230"," Just check something here."
"5695030","5696290"," I had a new tool yesterday. "
"5696810","5697150"," It's gone."
"5697970","5699650"," Uh, hold on here."
"5703370","5704950"," Long short ratio. "
"5705970","5707810"," My original money, let ratio."
"5708730","5712390"," Oh, it's not working right now."
"5712410","5713310"," I'll have to come back to this later. "
"5713490","5718150"," I've got a new tool that shows me puts being sold, calls being bots, fucking dope."
"5719010","5720510"," It's still putting any one of them that are out there."
"5720570","5726650"," It's still putting the fucking spot gamma hero indicators, badass, better than some other four"
"5726650","5727230"," letter ones. "
"5727630","5733070"," It literally shows you in real time, zero dates, real time, zero date, put buying, call, selling,"
"5733150","5734890"," call, selling, put buying."
"5734990","5737090"," I showed it on stream yesterday, but it's not back up right now."
"5738350","5739850"," It's not, it's not working yet. "
"5740270","5741910"," So I can't show it to you right now."
"5746100","5747300"," Yeah, I'm long right now."
"5747740","5748900"," I'm long right now, brother. "
"5749860","5752740"," Uh, if you don't already know that, I've been long since the bounce this morning."
"5761130","5762770"," Now I'll show you a later trader podcast."
"5764510","5765790"," You're in the inner circle, bro. "
"5766350","5767150"," You're in the inner circle."
"5767430","5769190"," So I'll show you behind the scenes someday."
"5769350","5770550"," I'm not someday, but we'll talk. "
"5772070","5773950"," Gotta keep some sauce secret, man."
"5774770","5776630"," Can't have all the fucking sauce out there."
"5777070","5777910"," It's fucking savages. "
"5778170","5781070"," Well, Robinhood, that shit fucking make it useless."
"5787320","5788340"," Hold on a second here."
"5793940","5795220"," Hold on one second, guys. "
"5796380","5798100"," All right, so I gotta get back to work."
"5798800","5799980"," Uh, you've got my rants."
"5800160","5801580"," I went off on a diatribe here. "
"5801940","5805020"," You guys, I'm going to tell you a few, this, I'm going to leave you here, okay?"
"5805920","5806800"," Oh, I've said this before."
"5807080","5807760"," I'm going to say it again."
"5809460","5815740"," Easiest fucking thing in the world you can do right now is put on a far dated put back spread"
"5815740","5817260"," date that shit for like June. "
"5818420","5819900"," You're going to slam the upside."
"5820140","5821200"," You're going to slam the downside."
"5821880","5822980"," You don't even have to make it that wide. "
"5823560","5827820"," You'll be able to cut, you'll be able to cut both sides at your choosing."
"5828280","5828820"," Does it make sense?"
"5829460","5832580"," You can just cut one side loose when it's printing huge and hard and heavy."
"5833220","5834840"," You hold the other side and we'll come back down. "
"5835000","5838340"," We know we have seasonal lows in February and April."
"5838700","5840540"," You're going to catch the seasonal lows at some point."
"5841280","5842660"," It's like a no brainer fucking trade. "
"5843760","5849300"," If you're trading it on a ticker that doesn't move, like something that just flat, you're fucked."
"5849740","5852280"," You traded on something that's not going to move this week, you're fucked."
"5852540","5856700"," You dated out far what, nothing time, especially an S&P 500 or even queues. "
"5857480","5858080"," Do it on queues."
"5858940","5860480"," You know how volatile that is, right?"
"5860620","5863720"," You're going to swing up and you're going to swing down regardless of where we're going."
"5865500","5873060"," Another note here would be, if you don't like that trade, just know that 4515 is a fucking magnet,"
"5873060","5873620"," right?"
"5873620","5879680"," As long as we park this shit into the 31st or a week later, even the 15th, we'll talk about"
"5879680","5880360"," that right now too. "
"5880980","5882920"," A trailer podcast brought this up the other day."
"5883760","5891500"," I'm going to give this a note here that this quarter, write this down, get a piece of paper, get"
"5891500","5892220"," a piece of paper to pen."
"5892880","5894360"," Seriously, get right this one down. "
"5895140","5902460"," This quarter, there'll be some bears out there that'll tell you that as soon as this quarter is"
"5902460","5903180"," over, we can crash."
"5903500","5905200"," Not crash, but you know, fucking go to the depth of L."
"5906280","5907780"," This quarter is not out there."
"5907940","5916360"," Not only are the indexes being held up by the 15th expiry, the 31st, I think it's 29th expiry, but"
"5916360","5925940"," the underlying of the indexes, all these fucking single ticker stocks, that"
"5925940","5928640"," expiry is not until January 15th, I believe. "
"5929560","5938400"," So you could see a sustained market pin into mid-January before you see, even have the"
"5938400","5942360"," chance for us to go to the downside."
"5943520","5953060"," So maybe, maybe lube up those 45, or those 4515s for like middle of January, end of January, and"
"5953060","5958480"," then you come in and you either hit it on the 31st of December, or you hit it, if you're"
"5958480","5961060"," doing spreads, butterflies, any of that kind of shit, condors."
"5961880","5966020"," Just think about maybe extending that a little bit in time. "
"5968100","5968540"," Thanks."
"5968740","5972220"," A trailer podcast just said January 19th."
"5972360","5976740"," So I got the date wrong, January 19th in Vixpiration on the 17th of January. "
"5977300","5979140"," So be aware of those dates."
"5981220","5982060"," How about this?"
"5982560","5983620"," I'll say this right now."
"5983760","5983920"," Binky. "
"5984700","5986340"," How far into the stream are we?"
"5986460","5988440"," It's a 1 p.m. 1247."
"5988920","5989720"," Binky, if you're out there."
"5992140","5997100"," Don't say I didn't tell you that a bear is going to tell you that we're going down on the"
"5997100","6005160"," 31st, depths of L, and it's going to be postponed until late January due to the underlying single"
"6005160","6005820"," tickers. "
"6006940","6012080"," So when they start to ramp up that noise, as we head into the corner, right?"
"6012520","6013700"," And they fucking fail."
"6014640","6015640"," And they say, oh, my bad."
"6015740","6017380"," It's not until the 19th of January. "
"6018920","6022440"," Re-cut this fucking part of the stream out so you can post it on Fintuit."
"6023060","6024140"," Thanks for your podcast."
"6024520","6025320"," Appreciate that, brother. "
"6037470","6038750"," Save that one for later."
"6043150","6044350"," No, no, I don't tell."
"6044490","6053590"," By the way, by the way, if I have said anything that is counter to Andy or Jim or anything"
"6053590","6057510"," that they've said to you, please, I love those guys. "
"6057750","6059530"," I trust what those guys say."
"6060730","6068550"," We have oftentimes all have said different things publicly on record."
"6068890","6069650"," I've been wrong. "
"6069810","6070810"," I say I'm wrong."
"6070950","6071250"," I'm wrong."
"6071510","6071710"," I'm wrong. "
"6071750","6071750"," I'm wrong."
"6072090","6073390"," You guys see me lose money when I'm wrong, right?"
"6074490","6075270"," Andy's been wrong."
"6075530","6076170"," Jim's been wrong. "
"6076990","6080070"," You guys got to stop going after these people."
"6080390","6082130"," I see some, doesn't happen as much."
"6082310","6085990"," I don't see this much, but like I see sometimes they'll like attack Jim or they'll attack Andy. "
"6086570","6087510"," Don't do that shit."
"6087730","6089190"," You guys are lucky those guys are there."
"6089730","6096250"," Like, can you just imagine one day if like, Jim was like, oh, fuck those people on Fintuit or fuck"
"6096250","6097890"," those, or Andy's like, you know what?"
"6098070","6100270"," I'm tired of the fucking trolls. "
"6100970","6102110"," You guys should go to their defense."
"6102470","6105910"," Even if they're wrong, you should go to like, seriously, I'm being dead serious here."
"6106050","6110450"," Like, guys like Jedi Marcus, guys like, who's the other guy?"
"6110610","6115810"," Who's the old trader that's he's like a beautiful hippie man now. "
"6116050","6116550"," I forget his name."
"6117030","6118430"," I always fucking forget his name."
"6119210","6123590"," Anyways, he's another cool guy out there, but any of those guys that you women out there that you"
"6123590","6127030"," see out there, even if you disagree with him, be grateful they're out there, seriously. "
"6128070","6128970"," You're a fucking retailer."
"6129630","6130650"," What the fuck are you looking for?"
"6130810","6135390"," Like, you think a bank's going to tell you he's fucking guys spend their time dicking around with"
"6135390","6136430"," us all day long?"
"6137250","6142170"," Even if they're wrong, please do yourself a solid support those guys those gals when they're out"
"6142170","6144850"," there spending their time with you on the internet."
"6145010","6145730"," I'm serious. "
"6146050","6148270"," Like, if they weren't there, you'd be fucked."
"6149210","6151310"," So they're a wealth of knowledge."
"6151350","6153190"," It doesn't matter if they're right or they're wrong. "
"6154010","6154750"," Really doesn't."
"6154970","6156110"," It matters that they're there."
"6156210","6157210"," You're the ones watching them, right?"
"6157430","6158670"," You guys are in their fight. "
"6158810","6163570"," They see trolls on their on their posts and I'm like, why are you trolling this guy?"
"6164030","6166570"," If you're a troll up there for gem, right?"
"6167070","6169470"," I'm going to tell you a couple of things through one of those trolls and tell you what not that"
"6169470","6173070"," you are, but if you are one of those and you're watching this broadcast right now, I'm gonna tell"
"6173070","6173590"," you a couple of things."
"6173930","6178510"," Number one, you are actually bringing gem more follows."
"6179190","6179930"," Believe it or not. "
"6180390","6188610"," If you're reposting gem stuff and saying gem sucks or he's wrong or look when he was wrong, I want"
"6188610","6191370"," you to know gem gets more followers for that reason."
"6191710","6192170"," Believe it or not."
"6192310","6194210"," I know you don't believe that, but that's how the algorithms work. "
"6195030","6195250"," Okay."
"6195350","6199190"," So if you don't like gem or you don't like Andy, you don't like me, don't comment."
"6199450","6200010"," Believe me. "
"6200250","6204950"," The more you don't give it traction with these people saying, the worse it is for them."
"6205230","6206970"," That's the greatest thing you could do, believe it or not."
"6207750","6213970"," How you get followers is typically posting something that's wrong or counter to what everybody"
"6213970","6214450"," believes. "
"6214770","6215530"," All that kind of stuff."
"6215770","6216030"," Believe me."
"6216130","6216750"," That's really true. "
"6217690","6220710"," Second thing here is you're a fucking retailer."
"6221410","6228210"," It doesn't fucking matter if you're a fucking bull bear seller buyer, bicurious, whatever it is you"
"6228210","6230790"," are, a fucking stock buyer, stock seller."
"6230930","6236950"," Don't give a fuck. "
"6236950","6238430"," Fuck and mute them or block them."
"6238730","6239490"," That's what you do."
"6240550","6241930"," You don't like what they're telling you. "
"6242170","6245790"," If you're a sauce that you want to hear is something different than what you want to hear or you're"
"6245790","6249010"," positioning and you don't like it, just fucking mute them."
"6249170","6251590"," I mute people all the fucking time on Twitter."
"6252010","6255770"," Not all the time, but there was a time when I was following some people that I was just like,"
"6256430","6260230"," like there was a time when I was following, when I was young, I was like, I'm following these"
"6260230","6260630"," fucking people. "
"6260750","6261590"," I'm like, no fucking way."
"6262090","6262930"," No fucking way."
"6263050","6263810"," Can I follow these people?"
"6263970","6267530"," Like get on Twitter, young on Twitter, like, no goddamn way. "
"6267910","6271490"," Like I was like, I'm following this guy and I'm like, I'm not going to name name like Mac 10."
"6271610","6273270"," I shouldn't say that name, but like Mac 10, right?"
"6273450","6274310"," I had him in my fucking stream."
"6274390","6275270"," I can't watch that guy. "
"6275670","6276610"," It breaks my heart."
"6276910","6277550"," It breaks my heart."
"6278170","6278710"," Northman trader. "
"6279270","6279530"," Love him."
"6280390","6280910"," Great trader."
"6281690","6285070"," But some of the stuff that he's posted at the wrong times, I'm like, I can't watch this shit. "
"6285190","6286230"," I can't have it in my feed."
"6286990","6291130"," Other people, I can't have poisoning my thesis or my thought process."
"6291350","6294310"," So if you're going to mute these people, you want to be friends with them still so you're not like"
"6294310","6295410"," a dick, mute them. "
"6296050","6299610"," Craft your feed for what you want to get from Twitter."
"6304050","6308050"," No, no, believe it or not, if you like them, you're typically not helping them."
"6308490","6311850"," I mean, you are if you like, I like you in this matter, whatever, believe it or not, the people"
"6311850","6314190"," that help are normally the detractors. "
"6314890","6320550"," I don't know if you know that, but detractors typically bring you more followers, not followers."
"6320890","6327070"," My best friends on Twitter, ones that I've had since day one are rarely in my feed."
"6327510","6328750"," I have to seek them out. "
"6329230","6332030"," Like people that I knew and I had no followers, I have to seek them out."
"6332450","6334950"," One of my closest friends on Twitter is Joe Donut."
"6335410","6335710"," Okay. "
"6336890","6341450"," Twitter algorithms intentionally scare me away from him."
"6341690","6342770"," I don't see his posts."
"6342950","6344490"," I don't get to interact with him. "
"6344530","6345350"," I have to seek him out."
"6345490","6350130"," I have to literally go to his fucking profile once a week and go, I miss this."
"6350330","6351050"," I miss that. "
"6351250","6351890"," I miss this."
"6352190","6352750"," I miss that."
"6353130","6353510"," It's intentional. "
"6354710","6356750"," They are they want you to fight with people."
"6357430","6357790"," Truthful."
"6358130","6358690"," Very true. "
"6360850","6364110"," Yeah, no, no, but I mean, you know, you get enough of cert."
"6364350","6365430"," It's not I'm not going to hit this."
"6365590","6368830"," I was using him as an example because he's an easy one. "
"6368870","6372870"," He's an easy target, but there are ones that are like hundred thousand followers, twenty thousand"
"6372870","6373950"," followers, ten thousand followers."
"6374210","6376070"," I'm like, there's no fucking way that's right."
"6376390","6377050"," They may be right. "
"6377290","6380790"," They may be right what they're saying, but it has nothing to do with the price of the stock market."
"6380990","6387010"," So, you know, you got a hundred thousand followers and you're dropping some fucking data on me like"
"6387010","6387530"," data dumps."
"6387930","6388650"," I don't give a fuck. "
"6388850","6389490"," I'm here from money."
"6390070","6391670"," Are we going up or are we going down?"
"6392010","6393370"," That's the important thing, right?"
"6394410","6395270"," I'm here to make money."
"6395410","6397670"," I'm not here to discuss fucking I'll be on it. "
"6397770","6402550"," I mean, I like reading that shit, but I'm not here to like, like I like what I like about"
"6402550","6402730"," Andy."
"6402990","6405470"," In fact, what I like about Andy constant is my inner out of the market."
"6405490","6407870"," I want to know the in the mechanics of it, right?"
"6408070","6408890"," So that's why I follow Andy. "
"6409130","6414810"," But then some other guy out there might be dropping like, you know, this is the worst debt that's"
"6414810","6419610"," ever been accumulated by the by Bob on Main Street."
"6419610","6421470"," And that means the stock market's going to crash."
"6421470","6422610"," I'm like, fuck that guy. "
"6422930","6424990"," I'm like, he's out of my fucking feed."
"6425210","6426810"," Like that fucking shit's bullshit."
"6427390","6429990"," That has nothing to do with the price of the stock market, right?"
"6433850","6435250"," I'm long all day long here. "
"6435250","6435910"," I bought the dip."
"6436130","6437170"," I bought the dip right here."
"6437170","6438990"," So I'm long right down here. "
"6439030","6439610"," I'm not sold."
"6440630","6442590"," I bought this dip fucker down here."
"6442850","6444570"," I did not sell this one right here. "
"6444690","6446430"," I want to see this yellow bar, this black bar."
"6446690","6448070"," I did this bullshit yesterday."
"6448670","6450350"," Just sat here all fucking day long. "
"6450490","6450750"," It sucked."
"6451190","6451950"," It really sucked."
"6452130","6455670"," I was like, check, come back, check, come back. "
"6456090","6457990"," And then right at the fucking close, they did it."
"6463480","6464700"," Yeah, I don't think you can."
"6465040","6469420"," I guess over time, you can look at a trainer and investor and say, you know, they're right. "
"6469520","6470860"," They're wrong more than they are right."
"6471880","6473800"," But like Andy's right more than he's wrong."
"6474120","6475520"," Jim's right more than he's wrong. "
"6477760","6479680"," You know who these you know who they are."
"6479780","6480680"," You can see it, right?"
"6480860","6485600"," You can see the people that are fucking always wrong or they don't adjust their positioning or they"
"6485600","6488080"," don't tell you publicly that they're adjusted their positioning."
"6489180","6491840"," It's hard for ice cream every fucking day for eight hours. "
"6491840","6494180"," So you guys know where I'm at at any moment."
"6494540","6500120"," If I already know about it, those guys don't have that ability."
"6500400","6501060"," So they do it on Twitter. "
"6501480","6502440"," And I like them for it."
"6502660","6510340"," Like Jedi Marcus, that whole entire clan of traders, SPX trader, M Lebond, I mean, there's a bunch"
"6510340","6513360"," of guys out there, women out there that are badass traders."
"6524860","6526100"," Yeah, exactly, exactly. "
"6531280","6533840"," Yeah, who said that when the facts change, they change my mind."
"6534040","6536060"," I'm the same way like price rules to me."
"6536100","6538720"," You guys know that price action trader above all else. "
"6539160","6540640"," Like what does cap use?"
"6541040","6542100"," Number one, price action."
"6542800","6547640"," I'm not going to sit here if I'm like short the fucking market and it just keeps grinding higher."
"6547780","6548560"," I'm not going to stay short. "
"6549200","6550980"," Markets rolling down to the depths of hell."
"6551140","6553800"," I'll buy the dips, but I'm not going to fucking say it's turning, right?"
"6554360","6556400"," I'll buy a bounce, but I'm not going to tell you."
"6556500","6557200"," Yeah, we're turning around. "
"6557300","6560020"," We'll go up to the moon here, any of that kind of stuff."
"6565920","6566660"," Alliant capital."
"6567920","6568660"," You know what?"
"6568940","6574340"," He got people say on people coming to me my DMS. They've said a line capital doesn't trade the"
"6574340","6574640"," market."
"6574840","6575480"," He's a fake trader."
"6575800","6576060"," He's this. "
"6576280","6576640"," He's that."
"6577500","6578340"," I like him."
"6578660","6580020"," But the guy's spot fucking on. "
"6580440","6583780"," He says things he gives you data that matters in the market."
"6584340","6585600"," The dawn of spoons."
"6585860","6586900"," The guy's a baller. "
"6587020","6589720"," Geico comes out there tells you long short on this net."
"6589920","6590280"," Froggy trades."
"6590640","6591900"," Whole bunch of great traders out there. "
"6592620","6593260"," Froggy trades."
"6593520","6593960"," Another great one."
"6594180","6595600"," Guys fucking out there on Twitter. "
"6595780","6596240"," That's his vehicle."
"6600000","6601120"," That's a great fucking job."
"6601340","6601560"," I can't. "
"6601600","6604740"," Those guys are great to have up on your screen or apps to fucking lutely love them."
"6607080","6611400"," And I don't really care if I don't really care if any of these guys are trading or not."
"6611660","6612680"," These guys give me signals. "
"6612700","6613860"," These guys are backing up pieces."
"6614180","6615220"," They're going against my thesis."
"6616220","6617860"," We're going up and those three guys that are going down. "

"7987200","7989400"," pandemic public emergency has ended."
"7989780","7994060"," What are you seeing and what are you seeing with regard to those people being able to gain coverage"
"7994060","7994860"," on exchanges. "
"7995900","8000500"," Yeah this has obviously been a huge focus for us for over a year as we prepared for the process"
"8000500","8002520"," that formally kicked off on April 1st."
"8002720","8007160"," Our priority has really been working closely with our state partners because it is a massive"
"8007160","8013180"," undertaking for them and leaning in to figure out how we can help them ensure coverage continuity."
"8013180","8019920"," And so we are seeing some of those administrative distant roles we're seeing roughly 25 percent of"
"8019920","8024220"," members who come back onto the roles because of procedural drop off. "
"8024520","8029160"," So we've been trying to help actually make that process more efficient and then we have been able"
"8029160","8034060"," to also help members move over into marketplace products in order to preserve that coverage"
"8034060","8034540"," continuity."
"8034920","8039400"," And so we're seeing that as an industry we're seeing that from Centine's perspective and we think"
"8039400","8043180"," that that ultimately is going to drive better health outcomes because those members have consistent"
"8043180","8044140"," access to care."
"8044640","8051340"," One of the things you told investors today was that you see yourself as a platform of growth when"
"8051340","8053320"," it comes to government sponsored health care. "
"8053420","8058560"," You already stand high on the hill when it comes to Medicaid high on the hill when it comes to"
"8058560","8066020"," the exchanges you have a million members and you're really trying to climb that hill when it comes"
"8066020","8066680"," to Medicare."
"8067510","8074480"," What are you looking at next year particularly since you had gotten lower scores from the Centers"
"8074480","8076920"," for Medicare and Medicaid going into 2024?"
"8077500","8082240"," Yeah so as we said we believe that the three pillars of Medicaid marketplace and Medicare are core"
"8082240","8082900"," to our platform."
"8083260","8088700"," We think they are all free really exciting growth opportunities and our focus in Medicare has"
"8088700","8095700"," actually been pivoting to a historic focus on serving that low income complex senior population"
"8095700","8100420"," that's consistent with the socio-demographic population we serve in our other two lines of business"
"8100420","8106020"," which allows us to leverage the local core capabilities that we have there into serving this more"
"8106020","8108640"," fragile complex dual eligible population. "
"8109000","8114340"," I don't notice you though advertising like some of your larger competitors as much."
"8114940","8117500"," Well so reaching those populations is a little bit different."
"8117700","8118860"," We're definitely advertising. "
"8118960","8120900"," We're finding the right channels to meet those members."
"8120900","8125980"," Those members also typically purchased through brokers actually through mail order."
"8125980","8130620"," There are different ways to reach the dual eligible members so we've been really refining our"
"8130620","8133400"," distribution strategy against that target population. "
"8134100","8139960"," And the big switch you're making next year involves your pharmacy benefit contract."
"8140440","8146120"," You have switched from CVS Caremark to Signa's Ever North, formerly Express Grips."
"8146400","8150740"," How is that going and what are you going to gain from that switch?"
"8151480","8155360"," Well we were really happy to be able to take more than 40 billion dollars of pharmacy spend out"
"8155360","8157400"," into the market in a competitive process. "
"8157760","8159020"," Obviously chose ESI."
"8159200","8160980"," We've been working on that implementation all year."
"8161320","8162200"," We've hit all the milestones. "
"8162600","8165280"," We actually had an early go live of one of our states in October."
"8165580","8166260"," They went really smoothly."
"8166840","8170660"," So we're excited for that one one kind of big bang that we have coming up. "
"8171100","8175660"," And for us some of it was a fundamentally different cost structure that we could acquire to the"
"8175660","8176620"," benefit of our customers."
"8177140","8179200"," Our state customers and obviously our federal partners."
"8179680","8184140"," But also the level of transparency that we know that our customers demand and seeing through"
"8184140","8187920"," contracts and understanding what the pricing strategies are. "
"8188140","8191379"," That's been an important thing for us because of the role we play in government sponsored"
"8191379","8192860"," healthcare and then innovation."
"8193540","8195700"," And so those were part of the criteria that we evaluated."
"8196200","8200379"," And CVS has been a great partner to us during the transition and we're excited to move forward with"
"8200379","8200639"," ESI. "
"8200639","8206719"," You know we've got a number of really innovative drugs that are coming on and just this week we saw"
"8206719","8211820"," the approval of the drug to treat sickle cell disease."
"8212680","8218219"," And more than half of the people who are affected by sickle cell disease in this country are on"
"8218219","8218500"," Medicaid."
"8219200","8226780"," But with these drugs priced at two million dollars how are you going to try to help provide access"
"8226780","8227879"," to these patients?"
"8228740","8233580"," Yeah so what I would say in general is my hope is that all of the stakeholders across the industry"
"8233580","8238180"," really step up to design ways to make this accessible and affordable because that's what we should"
"8238180","8239400"," do for things that are curative. "
"8239760","8240879"," We know the cost benefit."
"8241260","8243120"," We know the life benefit for those members."
"8243719","8248379"," And so we are working really closely with our government partners to figure out what mechanisms"
"8248379","8250959"," there are to again make this accessible and affordable. "
"8251520","8255200"," And we have best practices from past examples that I think we can lean on."
"8256180","8259760"," But can you really afford that all in one swoop?"
"8260080","8261639"," I mean in 2024 is that priced in?"
"8262139","8266820"," I don't think it all comes in 2024 and if you look at how Medicare actually treats these drugs"
"8266820","8271719"," there are mechanisms by which we can actually bake those into the rates going forward."
"8272280","8277459"," But again finding the right ways to pool the purchasing power and pool the benefit because we"
"8277459","8279920"," really should be focusing on what's the best thing for those members. "
"8280559","8282860"," Sarah London thank you so much for joining us."
"8282959","8283240"," Thank you."
"8283740","8284840"," Tyler, back to you. "
"8285020","8287719"," All right thank you both Sarah and Bertha."
"8288100","8293760"," Coming up a decision of epic proportions the antitrust case against Google and San Francisco could"
"8293760","8296059"," lead to massive changes to its play store."
"8296740","8298980"," We'll discuss what those could be when we return. "
"8299299","8299780"," We'll be right back."
"8303540","8439250"," Back to"
"8439250","8439790"," the exchange everybody."
"8440170","8444110"," Time for some show and tell where we show you a chart and then we tell you the story. "
"8444730","8449370"," Shares of choice hotels down about 10 percent since mid-October when the company first revealed its"
"8449370","8451870"," buyout offer for Wyndham hotels and resorts."
"8452170","8457630"," Now choice is launching a hostile takeover bid for Wyndham appealing directly to shareholders"

"8460830","8465030"," Here's what Choice Hotel CEO Pat Patius told Squawk on the streets. "
"8466830","8471930"," When you look at the hotel services market the combined share of the two companies is only going to"
"8471930","8478890"," be 17 percent of the rooms and those rooms are owned by small business franchisees who control"
"8478890","8479630"," their own pricing."
"8480230","8482510"," So the consumer is not going to be impacted here."
"8482890","8485590"," The franchisees set their pricing and their pricing strategy. "
"8485930","8489570"," This is not the dollar menu or five dollar footlongs."
"8489910","8492810"," Our franchisees concept their pricing as they see fit."
"8493870","8497410"," Alright let's go to Pippa Stevens now for a quick CNBC news update. "
"8497650","8498050"," Hi Pippa."
"8498190","8504090"," Hey Tyler Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a video today rejecting the idea of"
"8504090","8506050"," Palestinian Authority rule in Gaza."
"8506830","8511350"," The video on his official government account said that he will not allow the Palestinian Authority"
"8511350","8513890"," to take over once the war is over. "
"8514330","8516510"," This is in contrast with the US position."
"8517150","8521890"," Netanyahu said he appreciates the support from the US but that this is where they disagree."
"8522830","8528630"," A newly declassified US intelligence report said that the war in Ukraine has had severe costs for"
"8528630","8531250"," the Russian military in both equipment and troops. "
"8531850","8537430"," The report assessed that about 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded."
"8538090","8543130"," That's nearly 90 percent of the pre-invasion ground force of 360,000."
"8543610","8548370"," More than 2,200 tanks and one third of its armored vehicles have also been destroyed. "
"8549550","8555250"," And Delta passengers were stranded overnight on a remote military base in Canada after the plane"
"8555250","8556710"," made an emergency landing."
"8557350","8562510"," The 270 passengers switched planes in goose bay and waited hours to take off again."
"8563150","8565570"," But a stabbing issue extended the stay through the night. "
"8566290","8572070"," Delta told NBC that it apologized to customers for the inconvenience and will compensate the"
"8572070","8572390"," passengers."
"8572910","8573750"," Tyler, back to you."
"8574010","8578190"," Whenever a pilot says we need to put down and make an emergency, I say you just do what you"
"8578190","8578810"," need to do. "
"8579130","8579950"," I'll wait it out."
"8580310","8581150"," You heard me about that."
"8581310","8582390"," Yeah, Pippa, thanks. "
"8582930","8586970"," All right, coming up, it's been a tough year for housing but not necessarily for tri-point homes."
"8587710","8590310"," Shares there up 65 percent so far this year."
"8590430","8594150"," The CEO will tell us how they're attracting buyers, what he sees ahead for the housing market. "
"8595010","8598210"," And as we head to break, here's a look at markets, moving higher."
"8598510","8602750"," All three major averages getting new 52-week-intraday highs."
"8603170","8604670"," The exchange is back after that. "
"8605210","8606430"," Green arrows, folks."
"8774820","8780080"," Welcome back to the exchange, everybody."
"8780380","8785020"," The home construction ETF ticker ITB, climbing more than 50 percent this year. "
"8785160","8786460"," What a snapback from last year."
"8786880","8791800"," As builders reap the benefits of low existing home sales amid high mortgage rates."
"8792360","8797320"," Luxury-focused tri-point homes, among them, shares there up 65 percent on the year. "
"8797800","8803240"," And while its homes don't come cheap averaging about a little more than $700,000 per delivery, TRI "
"8803240","8809660","-point is a seeing increased demand from younger buyers with two-thirds of its customers being"
"8809660","8811020"," millennials or Gen Z."
"8811520","8816400"," And incentives like right-rate buy-downs could be what's helping to get those cohorts into homes."
"8817020","8819760"," Joining us now for more is Doug Bauer, CEO of Tri-point."
"8820000","8822160"," Doug, welcome and congratulations on the good results. "
"8822600","8828780"," What are you seeing specifically with respect to how rising or high interest rates are affecting"
"8828780","8830980"," the price of transactions?"
"8831520","8832200"," Down a little?"
"8832940","8833220"," Stable?"
"8833560","8833580"," Where?"
"8834740","8835840"," Well, thanks, Tyler."
"8836260","8843520"," You know, the impact of higher rates, whether rates are going up or down and right now the average"
"8843520","8847620"," 30-year fixed mortgage, conventional mortgage rate is about 7 percent."
"8848180","8856320"," We have the new home builders have a distinct advantage really over the resale market with plenty"
"8856320","8857400"," of levers to pull. "
"8857800","8861180"," We can offer permanent temporary buy-downs."
"8861720","8866020"," A majority of our buyers actually do a permanent rate buy-down."
"8866720","8871700"," As a matter of fact, as you look at our fourth quarter deliveries from our mortgage affiliate this"
"8871700","8876680"," year, 86 percent of our buyers are locked in at 6.6 percent. "
"8877400","8883160"," We also can use forward commitments, which is really a fancy term of having some mortgage funds"
"8883160","8885660"," available at a nice rate."
"8885660","8890560"," We actually have a forward at 5.99 percent for 90 days."
"8890880","8895940"," So these are the tools that the home builders use in today's environment. "
"8896220","8898820"," And frankly, I saw the CPI print."
"8898820","8902220"," I'm not an economist, but I think rates are going to stay where they are for the foreseeable"
"8902220","8902780"," future."
"8903080","8907760"," And it's a good thing for a tri-point in a new home builder. "
"8907920","8910440"," A forward commitment is not a term I'm familiar with."
"8910580","8912840"," So I might ask you to linger a little bit and explain what it was."
"8913020","8915660"," Is it a 90-day loan?"
"8915940","8917520"," Is that what it is or what?"
"8917820","8924060"," It's basically securing mortgage funds for homes that would close in the next 90 days. "
"8924060","8931320"," And I can provide you on a conventional loan of a fixed rate of 5.99 percent."
"8931540","8938720"," So it's another financing tool, Tyler, that we use in the new home building industry to attract and"
"8938720","8940860"," get buyers into our homes."
"8941600","8946140"," You know, by the way, our home buyers typically put down 19 percent. "
"8946980","8950440"," Their annual incomes are about $187,000."
"8950660","8955740"," So we deal with a very strong buyer profile here at tri-point."
"8956040","8962800"," I can see certainly why the home builders, such as your company, have an advantage over the"
"8962800","8968060"," previously occupied homes because those folks may have mortgage rates at 3 percent, 4 percent. "
"8968200","8968740"," They don't want to sell."
"8969060","8970360"," They're locked in like me."
"8971100","8971840"," Excuse me. "
"8972240","8976420"," And so the new home is really a great option."
"8976740","8978920"," But I want to come back to my initial question."
"8979820","8987640"," Are the prices you're able to get today the same as higher than a little bit lower than the prices"
"8987640","8991080"," you were commanding for an identical home a year ago?"
"8991960","8999340"," They're generally a little bit higher anywhere from one to two to three percent on, let's say,"
"8999580","9003040"," maybe around 60 percent of our community, 70 percent of our community. "
"9003380","9004960"," So the prices have trended up."
"9005160","9010960"," And it's because the fact that you're making, I mean, there's this locked-in effect in the resale"
"9010960","9011400"," market."
"9012120","9017180"," And as a result, the new home builders have typically about a 10 percent market share. "
"9017700","9021960"," Right now, we're enjoying about a 30 percent market share of all home sales."
"9022600","9026160"," So that locked-in effect reduces supply."
"9026620","9031980"," And when you reduce supply and demand is there, pricing will hold steady or gently go up. "
"9032520","9037120"," Interest rates, where they are, are going to keep pricing kind of where it is."
"9037780","9042300"," We reported incentives of about 3.8 percent at the end of the third quarter."
"9042960","9050560"," And so that's kind of a little bit of a governor as far as pricing into the future, as far"
"9050560","9051440"," as where rates go. "
"9051840","9055800"," So I've always said rates affect payment and pricing."
"9056160","9057060"," It doesn't affect demand."
"9057840","9059960"," So, you know, mortgage rates go up to 8 percent. "
"9060220","9061740"," Then we'll have to make those adjustments."
"9062100","9062240"," Yeah."
"9062640","9068160"," I think it's been a mythology, perhaps, or an urban legend that Gen Z and millennials were going to"
"9068160","9069560"," be slow to come into the market. "
"9069560","9073160"," But you're selling two-thirds of your houses to these demographic cohorts."
"9073360","9080640"," I assume that they are moving into houses for the same reasons the baby boomers before them, the"
"9080640","9082380"," Gen Xers before them, did."
"9084800","9086620"," It's your right on, Tyler. "
"9086960","9091820"," I mean, as a matter of fact, the Gen Z are actually buying homes at a younger age than the"
"9091820","9092300"," millennials."
"9092840","9094520"," There is that old wives tale."
"9094820","9098840"," And it's probably some truth to it that the millennials were staying in the parents. "
"9099040","9101560"," I have millennials that are in our basements."
"9101760","9102660"," They weren't in our basements."
"9102880","9110580"," They're coming out, forming households, and buying homes, 52 percent of the millennials own homes,"
"9111180","9116200"," Gen Z, 30 percent of the 25-year-olds own homes. "
"9116640","9124780"," So that demographic is a huge demand component for the future of housing as we look forward for the"
"9124780","9125760"," next five to 10 years."
"9126120","9131240"," Those of us baby boomers who may be selling houses over the next five years, we're counting on"
"9131240","9132840"," those millennials and Gen Z people."
"9133540","9138080"," We are counting on them to come in here and help. "
"9138440","9139320"," One other question."
"9139660","9142300"," Are you you mentioned mortgage rate buy downs?"
"9142800","9146220"," Do you sometimes get into the business of helping with closing costs?"
"9146260","9152600"," Is that another way that you can tip the transaction from from almost getting done to getting done?"
"9153660","9154240"," Sure."
"9154660","9164100"," We'll use a number of levers as I alluded to and closing costs, providing some options that no cost"
"9164100","9167060"," or some incentives on that are definitely the case. "
"9167540","9172660"," The one thing that I would like to make a point with you, Tyler, is when we talk about rates"
"9172660","9178700"," and there's this whole trade you mentioned our stock up this year, the home builders have typically"
"9178700","9184020"," traded down when rates go up and when rates go down the stocks go up."
"9184480","9188800"," The one important thing, and I think Doug Yearly and Stephen Kim mentioned this last week, and I"
"9188800","9196060"," think it's an important point for the industry is that tri-point in our new home builders have"
"9196060","9203460"," continued to deliver results despite higher or lower rates pandemics because we've structurally"
"9203460","9203820"," changed."
"9204620","9207860"," Our balance sheets are leaner, our leverage is leaner. "
"9208420","9213260"," As a matter of fact, we're generating positive cash flow and growing the top line and the bottom"
"9213260","9221120"," line and actually giving back the cash to our stockholders in the form of stock repurchases and"
"9221120","9221440"," dividends."
"9221920","9228000"," At tri-point, our book value for share has gone up 15% since 2015 annually."
"9228780","9230960"," That's a pretty good trade and pretty good performance. "
"9231740","9240120"," This rate trade and how the builders are perceived in this rate environment, I think we've put that"
"9240120","9241380"," myth to bed a little bit."
"9241820","9244940"," Doug, thank you so much for your time today and continued good luck."
"9245160","9246260"," Doug Bauer, tri-point. "
"9246500","9246960"," Appreciate it."
"9247240","9247860"," Thanks, Tyler."
"9248160","9248620"," You got it. "
"9249120","9254400"," All right, coming up, share is a publicly traded game makers like Roblox and Take 2 are higher"
"9254400","9258560"," today after Epic Games scored a major antitrust victory against Google."
"9259240","9264360"," The details and what it means for other apps in the Google Play Store next, and as we head the"
"9264360","9269340"," break, here's a look at some of the stocks hitting new all-time highs today, booking holdings"
"9269340","9274160"," chipotle, married into that international, and Costco, the exchange is back there."
"9459920","9460920"," Welcome back, everybody. "
"9461280","9464900"," Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite scoring a major legal victory against Google."
"9465620","9469700"," Julia Borsten joins me now with the details of the decision as well as the broader implications."
"9470360","9470660"," Hi, Julia. "
"9471240","9476660"," Well, Tyler, though, Google and Epic's battle isn't over, Google says it will challenge the jury's"
"9476660","9481420"," ruling in favor of Epic, but this verdict points to big potential changes for app makers."
"9481800","9487480"," Google could be forced to change its Play Store fees, which can be up to 30 percent of in-app"
"9487480","9491920"," revenues, enabling developers to pay lower fees or even avoid paying them entirely."
"9492740","9498580"," It also could be forced to allow these apps to offer competing app stores, which they would control"
"9498580","9500180"," and profit from entirely. "
"9500740","9505380"," But the judge will decide the remedies to Google's anti-competitive practices in mid-January."
"9506060","9511320"," Wells Fargo saying it sees, match and bumble as the most meaningful potential beneficiaries of app"
"9511320","9516620"," store fee reductions, which ruling does not necessarily suggest intermediate-immediate term"
"9516620","9520700"," benefit, expect the market to begin underwriting fee relief."
"9521120","9525820"," Wells saying that this could also be a positive for meta because it's been looking to have its"
"9525820","9529780"," users download apps and transact through its ecosystem for a while. "
"9530320","9535420"," Now, KeyBank knows that Spotify, match, and bumble have agreed to side deals that offer them more"
"9535420","9541280"," favorable terms in the base 30 percent fee, so not to read too much implications for those names,"
"9541720","9545540"," but depending on the judge's decision, they could end up paying even less."
"9545860","9550860"," And the smaller apps that have not been able to negotiate independent side deals, those are the"
"9550860","9554720"," ones that could really benefit from not having to pay as much to Google."
"9555180","9555500"," Rylor?"
"9555580","9557120"," Let me see if I'm understanding this correctly. "
"9557580","9564560"," Fundamentally, the two main places that people access apps are on the Google Play Store or the"
"9564560","9565960"," Apple App Store, right?"
"9566720","9572940"," Yes, and Google and Apple Act is sort of gatekeepers, and if you download an app from them, you"
"9572940","9578660"," then also have to pay a fee, not just, or if you're the app creator, you would have to sort"
"9578660","9584580"," of give a percentage of your revenue and effectively pay a fee to that gatekeeper, which is Google"
"9584580","9585040"," or Apple."
"9585080","9591320"," For providing the platform from which your app has been bought, what are the barriers to entry for"
"9591320","9597220"," those apps to do exactly what I believe it was you described, and that is set up their own platform"
"9597220","9603420"," or their own distribution vehicle or store to sell their app or others?"
"9604020","9609080"," Well, right now, it's simply against the rules, and that's what this lawsuit has been about between"
"9609080","9614880"," Epic and Google and also Epic and Apple, and that's why Epic Maker of the very popular game"
"9614880","9620020"," Fortnite is at odds with these two major platforms, which it says have a digital duopoly here."
"9620400","9623100"," So what's interesting is that sort of what precipitated this whole thing. "
"9623180","9628760"," Now, it doesn't make sense for every app to have its own app store within app purchases, but there"
"9628760","9633340"," are a lot of apps that would really benefit from that, and if you're a game maker and you want"
"9633340","9637520"," to be able to sell add-ons or tools for people who are playing your games, you would like to"
"9637520","9642160"," have your own store within your app and not have to pay any fees to a Google or an Apple."
"9642160","9645420"," All right, Julia, thanks very much, Julia Boorst in reporting for us."
"9645800","9651780"," Coming up from AutoZone to Ulta retailers, not so optimistic about 2024, despite the record"
"9651780","9656240"," spending over the Thanksgiving shop at the weekend, but after Morgan Stanley's retail conference,"
"9656460","9659860"," their analyst says this name should be a standout next year. "
"9660460","9663360"," We will reveal that name when the exchange returns."
"9664720","9669400"," So the same action is yesterday you're watching this just straight grind up, got a deep at the"
"9669400","9671880"," money call and just ride it all the way up."
"9672480","9675340"," It seems to me the game, the name of the game here, right?"
"9675440","9676980"," Just keep grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding. "
"9677660","9685780"," Do you want to tell you two things as we head into the close today that you could see some"
"9685780","9691780"," risk coming off the table into this close around two o'clock, usually 2-2-30."
"9692100","9698640"," You could see some risk coming off the market, so you could see some volatility, not necessarily"
"9698640","9701980"," down, but just realize that you could see some volatility."
"9702460","9706600"," You could also see a bunch of put buyers come into the markets. "
"9707300","9710020"," They more than likely tried to buy puts yesterday."
"9710620","9712760"," They more than likely tried to buy puts."
"9713160","9715080"," They're going to try to buy the fucking puts again today. "
"9715640","9720120"," They're going to try to buy zero dates, one dates for tomorrow, the open tomorrow, they're going to"
"9720120","9724240"," load the fuck up, which I don't disagree with doing that."
"9724300","9730240"," If you own this market in any kind of fashion, you should have a hedge on the market, so you'd"
"9730240","9735560"," likely see any format of hedging that you can think of."
"9735720","9740300"," There's all kinds you can be selling call or selling puts, selling calls, whatever your positioning"
"9740300","9741240"," is in the market hedge. "
"9741580","9745660"," So you should see a little of that fall coming in the close here."
"9746080","9751920"," So it is 150 in the afternoon, should be getting your trades wrapped up right around 230 ish."
"9752480","9756360"," And we're coming into this first rejection point up here, this PT one. "
"9756360","9759700"," So as we grind up into this, you got the second target up here."
"9760280","9767040"," And then we've got that's four, four 63 90 aligns with R two as well."
"9767520","9770020"," And then we have Valhalla to the upside. "
"9770020","9772980"," If you wanted a PT three in case, you think we're going to do it today."
"9773840","9777480"," That's four 65 65."
"9777880","9781480"," So we'll put it, we'll snap one more line up in here for that one. "
"9786460","9787580"," It's actually higher."
"9793550","9798590"," And this is going to be our PT three up here way up here."
"9798690","9799610"," Do I think we got this today?"
"9799790","9800190"," I doubt it. "
"9800990","9805330"," We might though sometimes we can squeeze up their last five minutes or so and get that one."
"9805490","9806690"," It's on the it's on the table."
"9806930","9808910"," So we'll write PT three up here. "
"9813010","9817510"," Now I'm going to leave that one down or I'm not going to leave that one up here until we"
"9817510","9824770"," break through or if we do break through our PT ones, your first target PT one right up here."
"9825950","9828110"," You should see some kind of a pullback."
"9828590","9831530"," Maybe a check of the one minute possibly even the five minutes. "
"9831530","9834750"," And then you're going to have your second attack above at PT two."
"9835050","9839250"," You know how this rolls right as long as we're trading off the one minute trigger, we're bullish."
"9842650","9850980"," The last time we saw our next guest, he told us it's Amazon and Walmart's world and we I'll be"
"9850980","9851820"," back with you in a bit. "
"9851980","9856440"," He's heard from more than a dozen retailers since then and says despite broad inventory"
"9856440","9861340"," normalization and some improvement in margins, retailers of all stripes are still striking a"
"9861340","9863840"," cautious tone heading into next year."
"9864420","9869760"," But once stood out among the pack five below, that was the mystery chart we teased just a moment"
"9869760","9874340"," ago, joining us with his takeaways from the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer and Retail Conference's"
"9874340","9875900"," analyst, Simeon Gutman."
"9876200","9877020"," Simeon, welcome. "
"9877200","9877860"," Good to have you with us."
"9878440","9879560"," Thanks for having me, Tyler."
"9880200","9881940"," You still like Amazon and Walmart?"
"9882300","9885700"," You think they're still just the big gorillas in this marketplace?"
"9886940","9892580"," Yeah, the message on that last week was that in an e-commerce world, there's two people now. "
"9892580","9893780"," I'll give you a mix of the share."
"9894340","9895940"," I'll give you a mix for everybody else."
"9896340","9896940"," That's the e-commerce. "
"9896940","9897920"," Keep on squeezing."
"9898080","9901320"," I follow Walmart and they seem to be the big winner in that regard."
"9901320","9902840"," We're going to see that really clear on that. "
"9902980","9906760"," He continues to take share at the pace of at the expense of more."
"9906940","9907460"," That's right there."
"9907880","9910240"," That's where the top line seems to be growing. "
"9911020","9914880"," Five below is a little different story and by the way, thanks for the dozen companies."
"9914960","9917180"," We had 17 of our retailers there."
"9917260","9922520"," Remember, I'm going to be closing calls up here as we hit this so be aware of that coming in"
"9922520","9925460"," the close call to makers that the toy environment is tough. "
"9925920","9929260"," But five below has creative merchandising that drives traffic into their store."
"9929260","9934480"," Just to put a salary able to grow closer to their normal algorithmic growth, which is pretty good"
"9934480","9936180"," mid to high teensy-ps growth."
"9936520","9941340"," Yeah, I want to come back to one more on 5.0 in just a moment, but I don't want"
"9941340","9944820"," to leave Amazon and Walmart in that e-commerce space. "
"9945620","9951100"," Isn't Walmart a somewhat distant second to Amazon?"
"9952620","9958660"," They are mathematically Amazon probably has 30-40% of the e-commerce market share."
"9958940","9959860"," Walmart's probably six."
"9960460","9964880"," If you look at the total revenue, 48 cents, Walmart still has a bigger over a share. "
"9965120","9966680"," They just say, you get a bunch of them for spending."
"9967120","9967380"," Right."
"9967880","9971100"," Now Amazon's doing that all online and Walmart is there too shabby. "
"9971880","9975280"," Walmart's many years behind in that regard and that's what they're catching up on."
"9975780","9982140"," At first, they went at it with a 1P approach and that proved to be maybe too narrow of a"
"9982140","9982440"," focus."
"9982950","9984480"," And now they've expanded the third part. "
"9984480","9985980"," That should be great futures right now."
"9986160","9989300"," They've been making way more putters like a seller somewhere in September."
"9989300","9991940"," So they've put a big emphasis in adding the marketplace. "
"9992860","9996400"," And I'm not sure Amazon feels their footsteps, but I think they can be heard now."
"9997040","10003240"," It seems that an undercurrent of the 17 companies is at the cost."
"10003240","10007440"," I want to draw your attention here really quickly at this chart down below, right?"
"10007440","10012260"," Five below this chart that I have down below, let me meet this really quick here. "
"10012260","10014640"," Stable positive margin outlook, new format."
"10015320","10018860"," I'm going to mute the or I want to just a director attention down here."
"10018940","10022060"," Remember, it was in a five minute chart. "
"10023500","10027440"," Maybe you want to snap that for your at home or something like that."
"10028100","10030520"," Um, smart."
"10030700","10039880"," And I said to you that the gamma profile into Friday is by here, sell here, buy here, sell here,"
"10040180","10041960"," buy here, sell here, sell here, sell here. "
"10042200","10044780"," And then we free up as we quit Friday."
"10045300","10048080"," That's becoming billion prime minus weaker."
"10048500","10052780"," So we can actually blast through into that four 72 zone. "
"10052820","10053120"," Okay."
"10053940","10058540"," So just be remember, we're just like, you see how we're just grinding up here?"
"10058660","10059960"," Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding."
"10061140","10063340"," And then they come in and sell us down, right?"
"10063700","10066480"," Then we come back up again, you know, you know the bullshit, right?"
"10067120","10069240"," Finally, the wall breaks and we head up to the upside. "
"10069620","10069660"," Okay."
"10081020","10084660"," This company has a full P&L working for itself in 2024."
"10085180","10085960"," Quick final thought. "
"10086180","10090780"," I think there have been two stocks that I have heard mentioned the most on CNBC this past year."
"10090780","10091480"," One is in video."
"10091820","10093220"," Okay, everybody knows about that. "
"10093520","10094820"," The other is Ulta Beauty."
"10095240","10096140"," Where are you on that one?"
"10097160","10097880"," We're equal weight."
"10098280","10102880"," You know, we like the company structurally, tactically earnings per share. "
"10103100","10105700"," Look like it's, you know, they're growing, but they're cresting."
"10105900","10108480"," This is a business then was late to recover, right?"
"10108580","10111060"," Beauty as a category was late to recover coming out of COVID."
"10111360","10112140"," They've done nicely. "
"10112780","10114180"," Valuation is kind of garpy."
"10114180","10115120"," So it's intriguing."
"10115740","10117140"," We just don't see the rate of change. "
"10117260","10119520"," Interesting enough into 24 as of now."
"10119520","10121100"," You created a word there, Garpy."
"10121280","10121680"," I like it. "
"10121880","10122340"," I like it."
"10122560","10123160"," Well done."
"10123760","10126780"," How about a couple of the other big box stores very quickly?"
"10127420","10130780"," Like a Lowe's, like a Best Buy, like a Dix. "
"10131980","10132940"," I'd say patience."
"10133340","10134820"," I wouldn't I would say don't force it."
"10135220","10137180"," Dix structurally undervalued. "
"10137280","10142700"," We think they keep a lot of the top line and margin that they that they got during the COVID"
"10142700","10142980"," period."
"10142980","10145780"," They they are proving the market wrong in that regard."
"10145800","10148740"," They are doing that so far, but still underpriced. "
"10150400","10152280"," Lowe's home improvement, I'd say be patient."
"10152940","10157640"," The worst of home improvement comms or sales are probably in the next in the next six months, the"
"10157640","10158880"," fourth quarter and the first quarter."
"10159220","10164000"," So while the market wants to discount a change of the interest rate cycle, it's probably a little"
"10164000","10164620"," bit too soon. "
"10165620","10167360"," All right, Simeon, thank you so much."
"10167380","10168440"," We appreciate your time today."
"10168920","10173580"," Thank you for that full rundown of all the stores in retail or big, big number of appreciated. "
"10174260","10176820"," Okay, folks, that the hour goes by very fast."
"10176820","10177780"," That does it for the exchange."
"10178140","10183200"," Coming up on power launch, regional banks had once been leaders in retail digital banking,"
"10183560","10184760"," according to JP Morgan. "
"10185120","10189540"," But now the firm is concerned they will fall behind in the AI age."
"10190080","10192460"," An analyst will tell us the names most at risk."
"10193100","10195360"," And Morgan Rhett Brennan is getting ready. "
"10195840","10199720"," I will join her on the other side of this quick break."

"10446650","10448370"," Because I think you're likely to see a recession. "
"10448750","10450530"," And so to me inflation is not dead."
"10450650","10454190"," The Fed is not going to raise early because they don't want to repeat 6 to 6 to 82."
"10454470","10458730"," And I know there was low inflation data this morning, but if you look at the NFIB survey, for"
"10458730","10463870"," example, 34% of small business owners planned to raise prices in the next three months. "
"10464850","10469690"," That is the highest level besides the recent period going back into the 1980 time period."
"10469910","10471590"," The other compensation plans are still high."
"10471690","10475910"," The labor market is too tight, which the Fed wants to make sure that wages don't perpetuate"
"10476310","10477550"," inflation and drag it back higher. "
"10478110","10481810"," And I think that means they stick around too long and they keep that liquidity turnik and on the US"
"10481810","10485250"," economy, which eventually leads to recession in the beginning half of 2024."
"10485630","10489230"," Can we go back to that previous screen that we just had on there for Brent?"
"10489490","10494050"," Because I want to get some clarification there on whether you foresee a soft landing or a"
"10494050","10494310"," recession."
"10494810","10496470"," You see a recession coming, right?"
"10496990","10497830"," I do see a recession. "
"10498050","10498810"," I see a soft recession."
"10499690","10501710"," I see one that's not as deep as what people fear."
"10501850","10506510"," I think it's likely to be soft because the consumer is still in pretty good shape even after you"
"10506510","10509310"," deteriorate a little bit on the consumer balance sheet. "
"10509710","10512950"," And I also see a Fed that can't pivot because inflation will be burned out then."
"10513150","10518070"," And I think they can pivot and hopefully help kind of cushion the blow as you push into the back"
"10518070","10518590"," after the year."
"10518590","10522370"," Shree, where are you on this sort of soft landing V recession argument?"
"10523730","10525470"," Tyler, two or three things. "
"10525810","10530350"," One, I think it is going to be a harder landing than what we just heard."
"10531110","10537570"," And the reason is that we have had substantial increase in the monetary expansion as well as zero"
"10537570","10540550"," interest rates being kept for too long a period of time."
"10541050","10547290"," And from that, when you tighten, you're going to have a pretty serious response from the market. "
"10547290","10548390"," That's the first point."
"10548810","10555890"," Second, interest rates will come down, come down sharply in 2024, but I don't think it has anything"
"10555890","10556750"," to do with inflation."
"10557510","10562690"," It has to do with the fact that as the interest rates were increased by five and a half percentage"
"10562690","10568210"," points over the last 17 months, something is going to break in the system. "
"10569070","10571490"," My top candidates are regional banks."
"10571830","10572770"," We had the first crisis."
"10573350","10575990"," I was looking for a credit event for the last year. "
"10575990","10578030"," The first of them happened in March."
"10578730","10583690"," I think you may have a second or third event also happening within the next six months."
"10584430","10589110"," And that will cause the Fed to cut interest rates as it always had. "
"10589430","10596590"," Even in the month of March, when we had three banks failing, recall that the Fed switched over from"
"10596590","10599730"," quantitative tightening to quantitative easing overnight."
"10599730","10608270"," And if that could do that, if you have a major problem with a medium side bank coming up, or"
"10608270","10614110"," if there is a crisis or the commercial real estate area, expect the Fed to react even more"
"10614110","10614630"," strongly."
"10614990","10617050"," And that's what brings interest rates down. "
"10617310","10621710"," That's what ends quantitative tightening and puts you in the quantitative easing mode."
"10622410","10627410"," So the reasons causing them are very different from talking about inflation."
"10627410","10635530"," And the reason, Tyler, is that the last mile as we keep talking about is indeed a very difficult"
"10635530","10635890"," one. "
"10636190","10643890"," I have been a student of monetary history for 50 years, and I haven't seen in coming down with the"
"10643890","10644530"," soft landing."
"10644990","10645210"," Okay."
"10646130","10652730"," Brent, you're both basically saying that you anticipate recessions next year, maybe one steeper"
"10652730","10653350"," than the other. "
"10653990","10658810"," Brent, it raises the question, are markets prepared for that possible outcome in 2024?"
"10659530","10662370"," As an investor, how do you position yourself for it?"
"10662990","10665530"," No, I don't think markets are prepared completely for that."
"10665630","10670230"," I think large cap stocks, for example, have been the hiding place of many investors who now don't"
"10670230","10671290"," believe there's going to be recession."
"10671590","10675310"," I think the recession will actually cause some consternation and some declines there. "
"10675710","10679610"," I think the good news is that more economically sensitive parts of the economy, small and midcap"
"10679610","10682290"," asset classes, have discounted some sort of recession."
"10682850","10687530"," That does not mean they won't falter during the recession, but I think longer-term investors should"
"10687530","10692090"," be contemplating positioning more towards those, especially when they let a recession, because they"
"10692090","10695430"," trade at 12 or 13 times earnings that have already marked down some."
"10695950","10697230"," And so that's where I think there's some good news. "
"10697470","10701930"," Plus the reality, I think we both agree that bonds offer value at current yields, because we do"
"10701930","10708090"," think that a recession is likely, and that will be the impetus for rates to push lower in the"
"10708090","10708770"," coming quarters."
"10709330","10710510"," Tree, is that how you see it?"
"10710610","10712730"," Is fixed income the place to be right now?"
"10712850","10713890"," And if so, where specifically?"
"10715170","10721510"," I've been saying since we were at the 10-year yield was at 5.02, the peak in October, Morgan,"
"10721890","10726290"," that it is a great time to enter in, and you're going to get the capital gain from it."
"10727050","10734490"," And even today, at 4.2, after the rally that we have had, I think long-dated fixed income looks"
"10734490","10735050"," very good. "
"10735690","10741130"," Shorter, the three-month, six-month treasury bills are a great place for you to part your cash,"
"10741590","10743790"," rather than be in a bank deposit."
"10744770","10747430"," So you have a twin situation here."
"10747650","10751230"," On the one hand, fixed income is very good for investors. "
"10752210","10755010"," Equity's face are clearly a headwind."
"10755410","10761430"," Second, on the other hand, in terms of banks which are looking for deposits and paying a very low"
"10761430","10765330"," interest rate relative to treasury bills, they are still at risk."
"10766030","10772290"," So that's why, I think, anything risky for the banks is going to be very positive for treasury"
"10772290","10773950"," yields and for capital gains. "
"10774650","10777570"," I don't see equities gaining much from this area at all."
"10778470","10778970"," Okay."
"10779710","10783650"," Malishik Kumar and Brent Shudi, thanks for joining us and taking off the hour with us. "
"10784170","10785010"," Thank you, Morgan."
"10785590","10785930"," Thank you."
"10786310","10790070"," Bond yields are flat today following the CPI data and ahead of the Fed decision tomorrow. "
"10790070","10791450"," Rick Santelli is in Chicago."
"10792370","10793650"," He's watching the markets."
"10793710","10794650"," He's in the pitch. "
"10794850","10795390"," He's got more."
"10796830","10799270"," Yes, Morgan, I'm always watching the markets."
"10799290","10804350"," I was particularly interested in the year-over-year corn today's CPI. "
"10804990","10810770"," At 4% second month in a row, well off at 6.6% historic high."
"10811250","10813130"," As you look at the chart, there's no arguing."
"10813610","10814330"," It's come down. "
"10814730","10819950"," But the issue is, if you open the chart up to a five-year chart, two things should jump out"
"10819950","10820330"," at you."
"10820630","10824590"," Today's 4% is the lowest in 30 months, May of 21."
"10825210","10829790"," But that also means it's been 30 months since this metric was under 4%. "
"10830490","10837950"," So it is still running on the warm side and we saw on the monthly numbers that core was up"
"10837950","10839850"," a 10th hotter as was headline."
"10840530","10846350"," Now, if you look at a 30-year bond chart, you'll notice at a 30 Eastern rate shot up on"
"10846350","10847490"," the warmer CPI."
"10848090","10853710"," And you'll also notice at one Eastern rates move down because we had a much better 30-year bond"
"10853710","10859090"," auction today than we did the last time we had one because the last one was a disaster. "
"10859650","10861690"," This auction was the best of breed."
"10862070","10863750"," Threes weren't very well received."
"10864370","10865430"," Tens was below average. "
"10865830","10868210"," But 30s, 30s was slightly above average."
"10868570","10872870"," And I do think auctions are going to continue to be a feature because I think debt and issuance"
"10872870","10874430"," will continue to be features."
"10874430","10879310"," And if you open that 30-year chart up for one week, you should notice that we're about 10 basis"
"10879310","10881950"," points off our intraday cycle low test. "
"10882350","10883350"," And that was at 520."
"10884230","10885710"," We're currently trading at 530."
"10886430","10887730"," Tyler, back to you. "
"10887730","10889190"," Rick, I want to ask you the question."
"10889530","10894430"," I should have asked you an hour ago and it didn't come into my head in time."
"10895110","10902310"," The month over month number went, let's see, it went up a little bit on CPI. "
"10902870","10905090"," But the year-over-year number came down."
"10905670","10906770"," Explain that to me."
"10906930","10914150"," Is that because fuel prices came down or is that because a high number a year ago fell off the"
"10914150","10915050"," measuring period?"
"10916210","10918250"," You know, it's actually a little bit of both. "
"10918570","10921270"," Year-over-year is definitely affected by 12 months ago."
"10921490","10924190"," But we do see that headline was up a tent."
"10924430","10925250"," It should have been unchanged. "
"10925990","10930450"," So the year-over-year headline did have a warmer aspect to it."
"10930450","10935170"," And that is the only metric, the only metric that was less than last month."
"10935510","10936810"," So you're absolutely correct. "
"10937070","10942470"," But the other issue is, is that we're at 3% in this metric in June of this year."
"10942730","10947610"," So even though it was a bit cooler, it's been even cooler than it was today."
"10948210","10954470"," If I was looking at all these numbers today, Tyler, I wouldn't be nervous about inflation, but it"
"10954470","10957130"," certainly isn't better than the report in November. "
"10957130","10960450"," Yeah, it's not like spiked the ball in the end zone, great, right?"
"10960730","10962590"," Yeah, exactly."
"10962850","10965870"," And I think that, you know, once again, thank you, Steve Leesman."
"10965930","10967830"," He liked me calling it kind of a rush yet. "
"10968090","10972570"," Because almost every guess that we've had on today kind of liked today's numbers."
"10972910","10977910"," And I'm not saying that inflation's looking super hot, but it really hasn't changed much to the"
"10977910","10978190"," downside."
"10978710","10984390"," And if your target's 2%, I'm sorry, 4% doesn't equal 2%, not even with new math. "
"10984950","10989390"," And he also complimented you for being a tough grader, which is a very nice thing."
"10989650","10990590"," Rick, thanks a lot, man."
"10990810","10991370"," Rick Santelli. "
"10991890","10995430"," All right, hopefully, I'm Mark Deale to reduce fossil fuel use as hit a roadblock at the United"
"10995430","10997310"," Nations Climate Summit in Dubai."
"10997750","10999410"," Let's get to Dye, in Dubai."
"10999910","11000290"," Hi, Dye. "
"11001990","11002650"," Hi, Ty."
"11002950","11007470"," Yeah, look, it's just after 11 p.m. here at COP and we're now being told there will not be"
"11007470","11009070"," a new draft of the climate deal tonight."
"11009510","11015210"," The last version released late Monday totally dropped language to phase down or phase out fossil"
"11015210","11015570"," fuels. "
"11016010","11020010"," It just said countries should take action that could include reducing their production and"
"11020010","11021370"," consumption of fossil fuels."
"11021830","11026290"," This is a major blow to those who expected ambitious action to slow global warming."
"11026670","11032150"," Reactions flooded in immediately, representatives from governments, policy groups, NGOs, one called"
"11032150","11036290"," the text a nightmare of weak proposals and internal contradictions. "
"11036970","11042190"," Former Vice President Al Gore posted on X that this COP is on the verge of complete failure and"
"11042190","11045470"," that the deal reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word."
"11045750","11050410"," He went on to say it is deeply offensive to all who have taken part in this process."
"11050870","11053910"," Now, late this afternoon, there was a protest here on the COP grounds. "
"11054430","11059650"," We have not seen much of that at all in the past few weeks, even with 70,000 in attendance."
"11060030","11062850"," But the frustration is clearly raw here tonight."
"11063270","11068750"," The COP 28 presidency, which is led by Sultan Al Gore, the CEO of the state owned oil company, the"
"11068750","11074410"," ADNA called the draft a huge step forward to that one analyst responded, I'm not sure which"
"11074410","11076270"," direction that step would be in. "
"11076490","11079430"," We have not heard from Jabair at all today, Tyler."
"11079650","11086950"," If I'm remembering correctly, next year COP is in Azerbaijan, which is also a heavily petrol"
"11086950","11089290"," influenced state."
"11089810","11091390"," Is there any controversy over that?"
"11093290","11095610"," Yeah, well, expect that to start soon. "
"11095610","11097690"," The focus, of course, is still here on this COP."
"11097870","11101290"," The next COP is not in some minds as important as this one."
"11101570","11106310"," This one was all about something called the global stock take, which was a report card on the Paris"
"11106310","11111790"," agreement that's required every five years to see if the world is getting close to that 1.5 degree"
"11111790","11114510"," goal of warming after industrial levels. "
"11115030","11117250"," And that report card was an epic fail."
"11117650","11122610"," This COP was supposed to be a reaction and action to that global stock take."
"11122610","11127530"," So really, it's all about this one, the next one, not in any one sites right now. "
"11127730","11130730"," All right, Diana, thank you very much Diana, Olik reporting."
"11132030","11137230"," Well, coming up an epic loss for Google, as San Francisco is very finding it, maintains monopoly"
"11137230","11139210"," power through anti-competitive conduct."
"11140210","11142630"," We're going to break down the results and check check next. "
"11143650","11145950"," And do regionals need to bank on AI?"
"11146470","11151050"," Why one analyst says those stocks will lose market share if they don't adapt to the new technology?"
"11320700","11321960"," Welcome back to Power Launch."
"11322140","11322700"," The make up for it."
"11322740","11324300"," Trade the Yarrow Bar. "
"11324560","11325760"," Please, just trade."
"11325880","11329640"," The decision could have big implications, not just for Google, but also for Apple."
"11330060","11331660"," That's the topic of today's tech check. "
"11331920","11334540"," Let's bring in Jerry Vosa and Steve Kovac now for more."
"11334760","11335800"," Dee, let's kick it off with you."
"11336640","11340740"," So this ruling essentially challenges the idea of Google and Apple as gatekeepers. "
"11340940","11342140"," And that in itself is a threat."
"11342140","11347380"," Luther Lowe has been one of the most vocal critics of big tech in recent years, and a voice for"
"11347380","11349480"," what he calls the little tech group."
"11349880","11352360"," This year he joined Y Combinators, had a public policy. "
"11352360","11355840"," And I spoke to him today in his first broadcast interview in this position."
"11355840","11359120"," He pointed out that the epic ruling came from a jury."
"11359220","11362960"," So they understood the complicated material and they were able to make a decision. "
"11363400","11367420"," He says that kind of key implications for the other antitrust cases that Google is facing."
"11367740","11368120"," Have a lesson."
"11368120","11374080"," What learning is that sort of the emperor has no clothes when you actually get into these documents"
"11374080","11380560"," and the plaintiffs or government are able to unpack the arguments to kind of a reasonable set of"
"11380560","11380860"," humans. "
"11380940","11387000"," And they see how much these large firms have been kind of egregiously putting the thumb on the"
"11387000","11387240"," scale."
"11388520","11391160"," Now he also believes that Apple could be next."
"11391440","11391760"," Here's why. "
"11393520","11398760"," The other interesting thing about both of the Google cases that happen this year is that they"
"11398760","11402080"," inadvertently put a lot of spotlight on Apple's bad behavior."
"11402940","11411380"," And I think the walls are sort of closing in on Apple because the epic case was all about how"
"11411380","11417460"," Google's self-dealing and kind of treatment of developers with regard to the Google Play store,"
"11417980","11420860"," that complaint has been primarily mounted against Apple."
"11421400","11426040"," And I just think that if you come up with a solve for Google, it's hard to not then turn"
"11426040","11428600"," to Apple and say, OK, well, what are you guys going to do?"
"11429920","11433940"," So Luther was involved in another tech battle that we talked about just yesterday. "
"11434040","11437640"," The blue versus green bubble, Android versus Apple messaging battle."
"11437920","11443240"," He says that little tech is on the march and the epic ruling is another win for that camp."
"11443460","11447760"," And we've seen more sort of cracks in these walled gardens just over the last year or so. "
"11448040","11453580"," I think the question that this epic trial and ruling brings up is how much more is there to go?"
"11453740","11454040"," Who's next?"
"11455000","11458660"," How is this how is this likely to affect Google and Apple?"
"11458900","11462800"," I mean, this is this I can see how big it is for Epic."
"11463060","11465400"," How big how Epic is it for Google and Apple?"
"11465600","11469680"," Yeah, Epic represents the group of so-called little tech."
"11469840","11474760"," They're not that little, but it's billions of dollars in market cap versus trillions of dollars in"
"11474760","11475220"," market cap. "
"11475380","11476280"," That's why we call them little."
"11476700","11480460"," But Epic is fighting for something that many others have fought for as well, including Spotify,"
"11480900","11481940"," Match, Yelp."
"11482140","11485000"," And that is for the gates to come down a little bit. "
"11485080","11490880"," So that's why I say that this really sort of undermines the argument that Apple and Google have"
"11490880","11498580"," these app stores or ecosystems that are supposed to be secure and keep users safe, but it also the"
"11498580","11503760"," little tech would argue punishes them by charging them higher fees or taking a cut of their revenue"
"11503760","11504480"," or profitability."
"11505120","11510300"," So if Epic falls, you could think that others are going to use Epic as for their own arguments to"
"11510300","11512500"," get lower fees that they have to pay to Apple and Google."
"11512740","11517300"," And that's where the effect could be snowballing a bit for for Google and Apple. "
"11518020","11521880"," To me, what's interesting about this is Epic has challenged Apple to the results have been more"
"11521880","11522180"," mixed."
"11522740","11525040"," In that particular case, the jury's was not involved."
"11525180","11528860"," They both weighed their rights that it was just a judge moving forward the decision with this. "
"11529160","11531800"," It was unanimous where the San Francisco jury."
"11531800","11537080"," And I just wonder how much that how much that sets the stage for future challenges as well."
"11537340","11537820"," There's part of it. "
"11537940","11539160"," Well, Google is going to appeal."
"11539360","11541700"," So this is by far, not a dirty idea."
"11541900","11544700"," We're very early is to take months or years to probably shake out. "
"11544800","11545940"," But you mentioned the Apple case."
"11546400","11550040"," Supreme Court is going to decide next month whether or not to take up that case."
"11550300","11552040"," Both sides are appealing that by the way. "
"11552420","11554300"," Epic wants to win the counts that it lost."
"11554760","11557900"," Apple wants to win that I think is one or two counts that they lost."
"11557900","11563160"," So that's all going to be litigated to potentially in the Supreme Court. "
"11563160","11565520"," If that happens, we'll find out next summer how that plays in."
"11565820","11570040"," I also want to point out there's a little bit more difference between these two cases than just"
"11570040","11571800"," jury or just the judge deciding."
"11572280","11576480"," It's also this idea that Google has painted itself as this open platform. "
"11577020","11581160"," You can sideload apps, meaning you can download apps directly from the internet."
"11581400","11582340"," If you want to, that's true."
"11582780","11583960"," You can use other app stores. "
"11584220","11586320"," For example, Samsung has its own app store."
"11586560","11587460"," That's also true."
"11587860","11593340"," But what kind of goes unsaid from Google is they cut the special deals with these manufacturers to"
"11593340","11599560"," make Google play the app store for Google devices, the default for app distribution on those"
"11599560","11599840"," devices. "
"11600480","11603340"," So effectively turns it into just like an Apple device."
"11603720","11608700"," So the contract you might have or implicit contract you might have when you buy an Apple device,"
"11609040","11613140"," you know what you're buying into when you buy into an Android ecosystem and they tell you it's"
"11613140","11613380"," open."
"11613520","11615140"," You can use any app service you want. "
"11615500","11620020"," That's technically true, but in practice, not as true as Google makes it sound."
"11620300","11623760"," So that was part of the crack in the case that Google had just now."
"11624120","11624500"," All right. "
"11624760","11625600"," Thank you very much, Steve."
"11625940","11627700"," Deeter, thank you very much for being with us."
"11627780","11628140"," Appreciate it. "
"11628600","11628780"," All right."
"11628800","11630680"," Further ahead, play time over for the markets."
"11631060","11632820"," Cuts continue across multiple sectors. "
"11633020","11633740"," That would be jobs, cuts."
"11634540","11636420"," Hasbro laying off nearly 20% of its workers."
"11636580","11641400"," We'll discuss that name and other key movers in three stocks once later this out. "
"11764590","11765310"," No time."
"11765410","11766830"," I'm in the back here doing some work."
"11767010","11772290"," I'm doing a bunch of work for somebody, but I can't look at other charts right now, but I can"
"11772290","11775550"," tell you that we are grinding up into that PT one and PT two. "
"11775790","11778670"," Keep your eyes on that cell down below over here."
"11778670","11784270"," This gamble wall that's above should ricochet, squeeze and ricochet right off that."
"11784510","11790070"," We're going to expect like a squeeze up and then bloodbath that and then we ping pong around here"
"11790070","11790610"," tomorrow. "
"11791750","11794550"," Unless we get some kind of unexpected news."
"11797110","11798830"," Just grind and hire right now."
"11799550","11803490"," Hey, we're crowd on RS. "
"11804090","11804370"," Hold on."
"11804530","11805170"," I got you RS."
"11805370","11816310"," Hold on,"
"11816310","11816310"," brother. "
"11816310","11816850"," It was good."
"11820710","11823410"," What do you want to know about crowd drag?"
"11824450","11827310"," Welcome back to power launch oil down four percent today."
"11827310","11830050"," Let's bring in markets and energy reporter Pippa Stevens now. "
"11830250","11830530"," Pippa."
"11830650","11836290"," So this is because of the latest CPI report from from this morning with fears that the efforts to"
"11836290","11840070"," curb inflation will ultimately cut demand for crude and petroleum products."
"11846210","11849790"," Dennis, also this growing sense in the market that the cuts from OPEC and its allies, those"
"11849790","11852870"," voluntary production cuts just really lack any sense of credibility. "
"11853530","11857590"," And so none of these head brands are new, but I think what's telling here is the lack of anything"
"11857590","11858230"," positive."
"11858670","11863110"," And so with all of these head brands mounting over the past seven or so weeks, why would you enter"
"11863110","11865110"," this market with no bullish catalysts on the horizon?"
"11865650","11871370"," However, for consumers, it is good news and they're gasoline to the whole of two bucks on pace to"
"11871370","11873750"," close below two dollars for the first time in two years."

"11877820","11879460"," This is CrowdStrike for RS."
"11879780","11880820"," If anybody wants to let them know."
"11889140","11890180"," I'm going tight here. "
"11892020","11893160"," Upside price targets."
"11894760","11895960"," Two fifty five."
"11898180","11900500"," Two seventy five. "
"11900500","11901660"," Close two eighty two."
"11910160","11911120"," Two eighty two."
"11911260","11914300"," And then this top take up here for your three oh four. "
"11914700","11922620"," I do want you to know that you're maxing out right now on daily and weekly velocity."
"11923340","11929820"," So you're either going to see a crazy mad rip with an immediate reversal, ping upon the time that"
"11929820","11930580"," you have in front of you."
"11931440","11933520"," This is the 30 minute chart right here. "
"11938300","11944500"," So this bar is right here."
"11945260","11947260"," 220 you have to hold 220 by the way."
"11947260","11954400"," And a trend is dead at two forty six and some change. "
"11954680","11956400"," So you can leave that one down here."
"11961300","11963880"," Green and this one green."
"11966160","11972340"," And what you don't want to do here is every time that you hit one of these you're going to"
"11972340","11973920"," you should reject right. "
"11974720","11975740"," So we're going to slow this down."
"11975900","11984850"," I want you to know that in terms it's bullish but in terms of that bullishness you're going to"
"11984850","11987690"," expect you know pullbacks along the way right."
"11993110","11999670"," Now if you break the hourly trigger this is the big bad boy down here you don't want to it's"
"11999670","12005130"," fine for you to come down here and bounce and consolidate to make this next leg up right. "
"12006030","12008610"," If you have to do that at each stage that's fine."
"12009070","12017150"," The one thing you don't want to see is any kind of break in rejection of between 220 and 224"
"12017150","12019450"," okay so make sure that you don't see that."
"12019750","12026190"," And if anything I want to see a bounce right on 220 220 flats okay 220 flat come back up"
"12026190","12029110"," consolidate and then take out that second high right there. "
"12029250","12034130"," So you might get just this first one come back down to consolidate trend still alive on a daily but"
"12034130","12040930"," you're a little over over bottom that stuff but otherwise bullish high priced target 304."
"12042790","12044430"," Hope that helped our ass if you're out there."
"12062320","12064000"," Ooh yeah bam. "
"12064980","12069700"," Let me just look at that just imagine you just way them way them straight up there into the"
"12069700","12070000"," clothes."
"12072560","12076560"," That'd be fucking awesome by the way that's 30 minute chart by the way."
"12084580","12090080"," There's your PT one there's your PT two and then you have some explosive moves to the upside there"
"12090080","12090420"," after. "
"12097960","12104600"," Yeah you get some you've got like if this is a two-sided thing on crowd is like when the"
"12104600","12109560"," daily gets that bullish it can just have sustained bullishness even if there's pullbacks."
"12110240","12116680"," So if you have like maxed out bullishness it's usually a time if you see weekly or daily weekly"
"12117660","12126100"," hourly max bullishness that's plus 50 on all three readings but even saying that once we get to"
"12126100","12131420"," daily bullishness above plus 50 what you can see is sustained upside moves."
"12131940","12138620"," So as long as you're holding that hourly trigger and the daily trigger or intraday the hourly"
"12138620","12143320"," trigger would be what you're looking for but then on a weekly basis if you did have a pullback and"
"12143320","12149280"," you were consolidating on the daily trigger and you gave time for the momentum of hourly trigger to"
"12149280","12156120"," catch back up to it get underneath price then you could then attack those last two upside moves. "
"12158570","12160070"," What do you got going on over here?"
"12165370","12169750"," Uh captain rolls benign tough for a squeeze awesome I gotta I gotta be honest with you guys I gotta"

"14257410","14266370"," all that kind of stuff i'm not bearish here in tesla and velocity could pick back up and you could"
"14266370","14272510"," get long tesla again but truth be told where we are i'd really like to see velo come back down"
"14272510","14280070"," into the negative on the daily it's the safest and happiest place for a tesla bull okay now your"
"14280070","14286450"," hourly is looking good here your daily is still hanging on so bulls have a chance here so we're"
"14286450","14292570"," going to start we're going to be i'm going to be patient with tesla bulls here um we're going to"
"14292570","14302440"," talk tesla okay so on this daily trigger go home write this down or"
"14302440","14309320"," you'll get the tool later this week but on this bounce down here this is positive right bounce on"
"14309320","14318800"," weekly trigger bounce on daily trigger all positive two thirty five ninety seven like the stonk"
"14318800","14326980"," next one two thirty three oh eight mark these at home dry yourself and own a little box down here"
"14326980","14333280"," right dry stuff a little box on the on the weekly dry stuff a little box right snap a line"
"14333280","14337540"," at home whatever you're going to do this is your daily trigger down here it's reversing right you"
"14337540","14342960"," have some positiveness and then you've got two resistance points here your first one is the half"
"14342960","14352640"," hour trigger that's at 237 64 then you have another resistance at 238 94 so for the bullishness"
"14352640","14358620"," for tesla here i like this of course we're not we're not at bottom of velocity in the daily so"
"14358620","14363480"," it's not like it's a dip buy that you can believe in at this point but i would really like"
"14363480","14370820"," to see for tesla is for it to come above here right squeeze to right here watch my cursor right"
"14370820","14379060"," there okay and then come back down and consolidate on this hourly trigger to give you real"
"14379060","14386240"," bullishness to attack to the upside up here you might actually see tesla perform tomorrow so what"
"14386240","14390840"," i'm going to say to you is this is all good structure here okay so we're looking for if our"
"14390840","14397560"," if our 10 we're 10 we're a price here i'm looking for this big old squeeze maybe come down here"
"14397560","14403340"," squeeze up there come up there and just if i can prefer it to be above like here i always"
"14403340","14408580"," prefer it to be above it shows more bullishness and then of course the hourly trigger comes"
"14408580","14413520"," underneath right the half hour trigger picks you back up over here and we're off and running again"
"14413520","14423200"," so if you're bullish on tesla here the target is actually higher it's 241 34 that would be my"
"14423200","14430380"," preference though tesla can fail these fucking sellers always come in early and try to uh try to"
"14430380","14435800"," tell you know we're going down brosif so just i'm gonna drop make that one yellow for you right"
"14435800","14443080"," there and you could outperform tomorrow if we pause so you might be cycling into this into the rate"
"14443080","14450220"," decision now i'm gonna caveat this with you tesla bulls are scared of cats i love them but you just"
"14450220","14454760"," like well they're they're like the big foam oars but then they're scared scared of cats too right"
"14454760","14460800"," so you cut or they get panicky they start selling so my point to you is this is that you"
"14460800","14470580"," want to be above 238 94 to get really bullish with the fact that daily velocity is already"
"14470580","14480400"," net positive right now and is experiencing lower highs on velocity on the daily basis you"
"14480400","14486040"," could still be a bear or bull trap so still be wary here but as long as you stay at"
"14486040","14495300"," any point you get above that 238 you'd be attacking or have a target to the upside uh right here"
"14495300","14504820"," at 244 50 okay you should enjoy that there now i'm going to warn you here uh if you begin"
"14504820","14513160"," to reject and break down below 233 like this you start seeing that action get the fuck out of the"
"14513160","14520980"," way tesla is going to have a fucking bloodbath it's going to be ugly okay really ugly like you're"
"14520980","14530420"," talking about a race in this entire move down here that's 204 bucks okay so you got to be your"
"14530420","14537520"," first target is uh 226 but i'm going to warn you when you this this weekly trigger is like trend"
"14537520","14545340"," and if you break this monthly trigger that's bear market uh for the price of tesla so uh 226 uh"
"14545340","14554040"," that's the that's the pain trade get underneath that 226 man uh 200 168 bucks it can get really"
"14554040","14562680"," ugly so uh my point to you here is you can tacitly buy a dip right now tesla run this"
"14562680","14569860"," bad boy up and maybe see yourself a nice end of the week run to the upside here uh do"
"14569860","14577460"," not uh be long tesla though if there's any breakdown below this uh weekly trigger here because what"
"14577460","14585660"," will happen is we'll end up happening as you would see this break below you'd see daily cross below"
"14585660","14592020"," the weekly and this cross right here if you get a six trigger bear cross like six trigger bear"
"14592020","14599060"," cross it's going to be nasty uh so you must defend this right here you have to and you can't"
"14599060","14603680"," be doing this for like two three days and like next week you get bearish on tesla next week you"
"14603680","14609000"," see that daily cross the weekly next week it can get like it ain't going to be staircase it's going"
"14609000","14615400"," to be fucking elevator to the downside so right now you're doing just fine as tesla bull right so i"
"14615400","14620840"," want you to realize that so all the doom and gloom and tesla they're buying they're buying they're"
"14620840","14626580"," buying they're buying just keep on buying this uh this looks more like i know this could probably"
"14626580","14631600"," looks to you like it's a bear flag for a crash down but this looks like does not look like"
"14631600","14637440"," that to me this is the edge that you have off of this is actually an edge on regular retailers"
"14637440","14642380"," they think that's a bear flag and it's going to blood and this is telling a different story you're"
"14642380","14649560"," actually on some major tesla support so keep your chins up buy the dip down here uh first target"
"14649560","14657680"," 245 245 and then you would be looking for some more consolidation down in here the daily trigger"
"14657680","14662580"," will come up the the week the hourly will come up and then you're going to start to attack the"
"14662580","14669960"," rest of that upside move up here the only real negative that i can see here for tesla bull uh"
"14669960","14675940"," would be uh would be that we're not buying it on the absolute bottom i always like to be a"
"14675940","14683400"," buyer way lower from here so um recognize that you could see some uh consolidation here and then"
"14683400","14691300"," you get your your push above here on tesla 252 so something like this forget i apologize for the"
"14691300","14695280"," look of this shit it looks kind of it's kind of stupid and put three little pumps in and all"
"14695280","14700160"," that kind of stuff but you get the point right way i'm in then way i'm right up there so"
"14700160","14709140"," if you're tesla bull chin up if you are looking at our little chart over here where are we we"
"14709140","14714720"," got the sell up here so just be aware as we come into this zone people are going to try"
"14714720","14722100"," to take profit up here does not matter if we squeeze above you want to take this part of the"
"14722100","14731720"," trade right poor these people scared right i want to see results right these people right here"
"14731720","14738320"," guess where they step in right here and they get rolled over you're the guy that's in here you're"
"14738320","14742360"," the gal that's in here this is the meat of the trade for you you want to run this up"
"14742360","14747540"," and then you could leave some runners on in case we squeeze leave one or two on or ten on"
"14747540","14752320"," or a hundred on we trade in a thousand contracts whatever the fucking is you're doing but this is"
"14752320","14759920"," the time for you as a trainer to be exiting right you got people that are like not buyer cap"
"14759920","14766900"," not a buyer cap i'm a buyer now cap right and what we we sell into those people i want"
"14766900","14772120"," to be honest with you we sell into those fucking people uh so foam oars we we sell into these"
"14772120","14777260"," people as we squeeze up uh now next thing let's say you're like oh fuck you cap we're gonna go"
"14777260","14783840"," to 470 by tomorrow okay all i want to see is the squeeze up the consolidation and then the move"
"14783840","14788920"," higher from this previous high and i'll jump right fucking back on board with you right there and"
"14788920","14798240"," i'll run this bad boy up and i'll meet you at the top when you're buying 470 so terrible saying"
"14798240","14807080"," that stuff someone's at home is just like i fucking hate this guy but i watch him every day because"
"14807080","14817020"," come on the wrong side of the fucking trade look at that building a little"
"14817020","14824240"," base on pt2 right now what are they building that base for pt3 to the upside right here can they"
"14824240","14833960"," get it can they get pt3 we'll find out shutting"
"14833960","14842120"," the fucking door dude primal was listening earlier i told primal earlier i was like there is a door"
"14842120","14847460"," closing here i'm warning you if you're if you're not you but i'm if you know you like your favorite"
"14847460","14853440"," bear out there that's doing gloom he's probably sitting at home right now i don't i'm not i don't"
"14853440","14860280"," hate him or anything but there's a door closing on them right now um to down side like even if"
"14860280","14866440"," you get a thousand points you have my picture here like even if we get out a thousand points you're"
"14866440","14876440"," shutting the door uh on 3,500 we're now at 4,500 now trading 4,600 that's 1 "
"14876440","14885860",",100 points right uh the probabilities of going back now to 3,600 are 30"
"14885860","14895380"," percent 35 uh 100 is likely 20 now 25 percent uh and if they if we slam up to 470"
"14895380","14905320"," and 480 uh you know uh that low in in october is likely never to"
"14905320","14911320"," be seen again unless we get some fraud it would be a big move to uh go down 1,100"
"14911320","14917500"," fucking points 1,200 points a big move down that's uh that's a bear market basically i think i"
"14917500","14923480"," think it is it's more than 20 right i don't know what 480 times 0.20 is off the top"
"14923480","14931060"," of my head i should but i don't i think it's 25 percent 26 percent something like that so big"
"14931060","14936680"," moves here closing the door i'm should i post that i don't think it's probably unkind to post that"
"14936680","14942180"," right now it's probably uh gonna piss somebody off on social media so i'll refrain from that on"

"14955000","14963060"," door basically right now uh anywhere at 470, 480 you're closing you're effectively closing the"
"14963060","14972680"," front are the door on uh any any argument from a seller that we would revisit or go lower than"
"14972680","14980520"," 3,500 unless we get some fraud uh effectively you're you're giving them a very very low probability"
"14980520","14990240"," of ever seeing that again i mean it's a cool thing but at the same time you know you don't"
"14990240","14998480"," want to see fucking you know you just you just destroyed uh a lot of high follow accounts thesis is"
"14998480","15010130"," right uh especially like fin twitters and stuff uh"
"15010130","15017530"," yes if you're a bear out there um consider that please uh that that we will never likely return"
"15018100","15025170"," unless we have a major like you're talking like fucking fraud like basically a depression fraud war"
"15025170","15031810"," um something major would have to happen bigger than covid believe it or not you would you look back"
"15031810","15038430"," at the uh prior lows to covid uh we still hadn't seen any major down prior prior moves so you're"
"15038430","15048260"," talking about something bigger than covid would need to happen yeah no it doesn't really"
"15048260","15052960"," you if you start looking at like the i mean i get i get the points here we're gonna i"

"15059520","15067520"," there was a a group think right very strong group think of um 35 was not the bottom and it"
"15067520","15074760"," what had had we had a high probability of going way lower but those probabilities start to turn you"
"15074760","15079540"," know what i mean it's kind of like saying uh we're gonna go back to 100 bucks on spy right"
"15080020","15087880"," that probability is like point zero zero zero zero five or something uh so just this right here is"
"15087880","15096080"," kind of a big moment uh coming up here to this what we have right now 46 43 um it's"

"15102120","15108160"," 1300 points uh it's a tough argument it's a tough pill to swallow i can see us going down uh"

"15208960","15218540"," these probabilities start to adjust uh based on price right um we went over this man in uh"
"15218540","15228000"," december or november of uh 2021 i think september october uh november we were going over what the"
"15228000","15233480"," expected the downside expectations were and we assigned matter of fact uh you want to find somebody"

"15247380","15252300"," probabilities change as time passes like there's a higher probability but when we went into"
"15252300","15259000"," december january right right around there we had higher probabilities depending upon the velocity"
