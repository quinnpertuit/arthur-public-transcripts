"4810","9550"," So, noting oil features, quickly extending gains here with the Brent crude up by around $2 a barrel"
"9550","12050"," at WTR for around 3% on the session as well."
"25550","30770"," And in the 1996, I'm noting that Pac West Bangkok shows jump of 30% of the open up to"
"30770","31810"," their POCW."
"65520","107580"," Good morning"
"107580","107940"," out there. "
"129500","130060"," Get right into it."
"132180","133600"," Okay, right off the opening bell."
"134200","135320"," I don't know what that is right there. "
"136080","137460"," Make sure I get this right here."
"148840","157360"," We're at a five minute chart right now, 4.1.66. What is going on right there?"
"158260","166740"," 11.66 is the pivot, 409.61. I don't know why that's wrong."
"168480","175240"," Okay, just off the opening bell here for a 6.58. A little bit high. "
"181260","182940"," Just off the opening bell."
"183460","184860"," Let me show you guys a couple of things here."
"186860","190140"," We're kind of looking for a kiss play off the opening bell. "
"195390","196790"," Straighten that out a little bit there."
"200610","201590"," This morning."
"201950","204150"," So let me impose some of this stuff up real quick. "
"220100","222200"," That's a GME."
"224220","224820"," KRE."
"226760","228060"," And Tesla, GME, KRE. "
"228620","228980"," And what else?"
"229800","230720"," NFL X today."
"242480","245640"," That was right there."
"246440","247740"," That was all that up right there. "
"248700","249540"," That was right there."
"249600","250060"," Good morning, everybody."
"250240","251320"," Hope everybody's doing well out there. "
"253380","254160"," Check on Twitch."
"254500","255860"," Make sure Twitch is up and running."
"256820","258399"," Let me go to a multi stream here. "
"258560","259579"," So don't miss all of your chats."
"261380","261920"," Happy Monday."
"262480","263560"," Hope you had a great weekend. "
"265720","266440"," Good morning."
"266600","267360"," Let me have a sip of coffee here."
"277320","278040"," That's weird. "
"281680","282200"," That's weird."
"289980","296960"," We meet that right there and see if I've got the echo coming back in my desktop audio."
"303590","306310"," Yeah, I got the I got rid of the I think I got rid of the echo. "
"306310","307570"," I'll find out here in just a moment."
"311610","312690"," I heard the echo too."
"316730","318630"," Couple things I got to do in the background here. "
"322060","324080"," Ended up working all weekend."
"329720","331180"," Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"331280","331860"," And that task. "
"334620","335580"," That task."
"338240","339200"," Right there."
"339500","345200"," And I've got another thing that I need to ask you guys about this morning is I."
"345200","355070"," I have moved over to fiber. "
"355630","357410"," So I don't know what that means."
"361210","368190"," Well, I mean, I think I know what it means, but I don't know what its impact is on this"
"368190","368810"," stream yet."
"369530","370730"," You know, people promise things. "
"371070","372690"," And then you find out that it's bullshit and lies."
"374010","375210"," You still have an echo out there right now?"
"379270","381430"," The fiber looks really makes me look even better."
"381610","382170"," Oh, I love you. "
"382270","382730"," Who is that?"
"383290","384170"," Bumple Dine."
"384490","385310"," Oh, I love you."
"387850","389890"," Okay, we're back to no echo right on right on. "
"390110","391030"," Yeah, there was an echo."
"392130","393990"," I had unmuted Twitch."
"394990","397910"," I remember now I unmuted it yesterday. "
"398430","402150"," I was watching some other streamers yesterday with a friend."
"402390","406770"," I was checking out ideas for the show."
"410280","411980"," People are like, you got to check this person out. "
"412160","412800"," Check that person out."
"412860","413240"," I'm like, okay."
"416020","416500"," Thanks. "
"416600","417140"," I appreciate it."
"418680","420520"," We'll make the we'll make no difference."
"420880","421080"," Yeah. "
"423620","426860"," So the idea here is that it was twofold."
"428300","432080"," I live in Michigan and Comcast Xfinity."
"432440","434120"," Their lines are down all the time. "
"434740","443320"," Not only they don't lines down all the time, but they're when power goes out, even if their lines"
"443320","445360"," don't get knocked down, they just turn that shit off."
"446700","451620"," And of course they act like you don't know because you're like my power goes out and I have"
"451620","453440"," generator."
"454700","459520"," So I know it's like the internet will stay on and then all of a sudden it'll just shut off. "
"460140","463920"," And of course they're like, well, they're like, we're not going to give your money back."
"464540","466140"," If my power is out for a week."
"467620","468980"," Because I didn't know any better anyways. "
"469420","472160"," And then like turn it right back on right before the power comes back on."
"472680","475920"," Now you might be like, yeah, it's because it's on the same power line or whatever."
"478520","482760"," I'll tell you what my friends say here that when I finally got to them, it never goes out. "
"483000","484060"," When power goes out, it doesn't matter."
"484200","485400"," I don't know if it's because it's lower in the poll."
"485400","492540"," If it's because of, I don't know what the reason is, but fiber here is more reliable. "
"493280","495080"," The other aspect here is that fiber."
"496900","499040"," I'm going to bring a bunch of stuff over for you, don't I?"
"499720","503400"," Fiber here is or versus like Xfinity."
"503600","505960"," So I had so one point I was paying 360,"
"505960","514740"," I think. "
"514740","516940"," And I got a full plane alert."
"517240","518120"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"520880","523420"," I had to upgrade to do the stream. "
"524580","526460"," They were throttling me anyways."
"526940","536280"," And as a matter of fact, my wife works as a physical therapist and she works from home."
"536460","539920"," And then my children are secular homeschoolers. "
"541920","546000"," So that means that they have tutors and they have an online teacher."
"547100","549280"," It's not like it's like I'm teaching them."
"551060","552800"," It's like I'm more one teaching them. "
"553280","556820"," So you've got a lot of usage, internet usage, right, a lot of demand."
"559680","563600"," And so I had to have, I had to have like the best internet."
"563840","564560"," Well, that didn't work. "
"565500","574900"," The other issue is latency, like the size of the tube on the size of the tube"
"574900","577340"," for uploading."
"577880","582440"," So like my download speeds would be okay, like between three and six hundred depending on the day."
"592200","595960"," They'd be like good, but my upload was terrible. "
"596740","598920"," And that does impact the stream."
"599120","604820"," It impacts the latency or how long it takes for me to do what I have to do in the"
"604820","606400"," background and send it all the way back to you."
"611860","613880"," There's the hourly trigger right here. "
"613980","615580"," I want to talk to you guys about something right now."
"616440","619720"," So it being Monday right now, there's two things to be keyed into."
"620540","625220"," Number one, if we do continue higher. "
"627660","634920"," Normally on a Monday, right, I'm looking for us to close the gap down here minimum."
"636040","637360"," This is the gap right here."
"639440","643700"," At least touch this pre market low. "
"643920","644640"," That's like bare minimum."
"644800","645440"," Close that gap."
"646020","646980"," Like that's what I want. "
"650970","651810"," Close the gap."
"651810","655930"," And then maybe touch the pre market lows."
"656790","657690"," That's like number one. "
"659630","661710"," The second key here is."
"663350","664890"," I really want to see."
"666370","667670"," Some kind of a."
"670490","672010"," It's called a kiss play. "
"674070","677290"," And it's more like a let me make sure I got all this right here."
"679170","682430"," I want to show it to you."
"690100","692820"," I'm going to explain it better here for you in just a moment. "
"693580","695840"," So I mean, we meet some of this stuff here."
"697220","698340"," Happy Monday, everybody."
"702260","703780"," I almost didn't come on. "
"703960","708000"," Well, I was running late too, but I almost didn't come on because I was like, you know what?"
"708200","708480"," It's better."
"709040","711180"," Like sometimes it's better with the market open up for you guys."
"712620","713640"," Especially on a Monday. "
"714880","716760"," There's a couple of things I want you to see here."
"722100","725920"," So a kiss play is like coming back and kissing this this hourly."
"727600","731120"," It's just a way to check to make sure that yes, we are going up. "
"731660","733100"," Now we don't have to do this."
"734200","737320"," But I always like doing this like just, you know, it's a Monday."
"737500","738520"," We come back down here. "
"739380","741760"," You have like turn around Tuesday, right?"
"742100","744700"," Turn around Tuesday can be a bull day or a bear day."
"745320","751540"," But on a Monday, if you kind of came down here and just tested this, then we had turn around"
"751540","756540"," Tuesday coming up or we come down here and test this and they come up."
"756640","757380"," I always prefer that. "
"757560","760080"," It gives Vic some breathing room."
"761520","763100"," And then on Friday, I was talking to you guys."
"763320","766740"," If we gapped up overnight, if we gapped up, then it would be an automatic cell. "
"766880","768900"," Remember I talked to you about on Friday."
"769120","772020"," I was like, yeah, if we gapped up, we're going to sell it."
"773680","778360"," If we trade sideways and down into Monday, it'll be a nice dip to buy. "
"778520","780540"," It'll be a nice way to close out some put spreads."
"783980","785580"," That's what my take was for Monday."
"785700","788260"," And I was like, yeah, I was like, we can go take the bull cases. "
"788480","791880"," We gapped up over Sunday futures and we sell Monday."
"792920","798920"," The bear case is that we trade sideways and down into Monday and kiss this hourly trigger down"
"798920","799180"," here."
"800180","801840"," Just to confirm the move is higher. "
"802160","805720"," Now saying all that right now where we are."
"807260","809480"," I'm looking at this hourly here."
"809660","811960"," See this hourly velocity right here?"
"812080","812780"," Pay attention to this. "
"813540","814920"," It's a little toppy, right?"
"815780","817060"," Now it can stay toppy."
"818200","821900"," We have previous examples of it coming up here and staying up here."
"822840","823740"," But we didn't get the gap. "
"824220","826040"," The gap up overnight, did we?"
"826040","831900"," And the daily velocity is not its way down."
"832680","835040"," So I can pause it a couple of things."
"835900","840400"," I can pause it that we're a little overbought on the hourly. "
"842820","845100"," Any rips higher likely shortable."
"846380","847760"," Likely not going to be supported."
"850080","854040"," We are in bull trend, so this can stay irrational longer. "
"854040","855580"," But I need both of these."
"857060","858480"," Or not even both of these."
"858740","860300"," In reality what I need is. "
"860780","862660"," So we're up here right now, right?"
"862960","864500"," So look at this whole entire area here."
"866780","867740"," Is this shortable?"
"867980","868620"," Fuck yeah it is."
"868820","869320"," Is that shortable?"
"869540","870300"," Hell yeah it is. "
"870820","872180"," Are these dips viable?"
"872940","873740"," Day trade and they are."
"875260","879120"," What do I need to happen for me to buy a dip day trade though?"
"879940","882460"," Is I need this green stuff right here?"
"882520","883940"," I need this green in the bottom you see."
"886440","888280"," And you can see they directly correlate. "
"888660","891340"," So if I'm trying to buy a rip on a Monday."
"892800","895700"," I probably at least want to have that right there."
"897280","899100"," You know like I want safety man. "
"899640","900440"," You know what I'm saying?"
"900660","902480"," Like I want like high probability."
"906640","908140"," So it's Monday morning."
"909120","910900"," And do I think it continues higher?"
"911600","912060"," I don't know. "
"912700","915900"," What I do know is my favorite set up."
"917600","919540"," I'm looking for some proof over here."
"922930","925590"," You know there's a couple other nice things over here too right?"
"925810","927070"," Like I'm looking for some proof. "
"927970","930830"," Now another thing to be looking for me to be looking at here is."
"935930","937610"," I'm on that T1 chart."
"937830","938370"," Let's go to the one minute. "
"940830","941810"," Let's just look at this."
"941830","942910"," This is a day trader chart."
"944950","946610"," Here's a day trader chart okay?"
"948470","950470"," So let's just look at a day trader chart. "
"950510","951610"," A rock oil ministry."
"951990","957570"," A rock resumes oil exports from Al-Qaeda oil field with a capacity of 33,000 boughs per day."
"958150","959110"," Same thing right?"
"959370","961730"," I'm looking for these green boxes to be in the downside. "
"962890","965450"," And I'm also looking for these red boxes to be in the downside."
"965910","967030"," This is a beautiful one right here."
"967830","968910"," Get a free trial. "
"968910","969870"," Take strike."
"969870","970770"," Look at that."
"971470","972190"," There's one. "
"973850","975210"," And there's two right?"
"976230","979130"," I'm on max bearishness on the early."
"979430","981510"," I'm on max bearishness in the five minute."
"981630","983550"," I'm on max bearishness on the one minute. "
"984070","985830"," Max bearishness in the one minute."
"986010","989510"," What max bearishness on the five minute."
"989750","990930"," Okay bearishness in the green. "
"991730","996070"," You can see went down a bit more but I could have bought a five day and printed burr anyways."
"996070","999170"," So am I seeing that right now?"
"1000670","1001490"," Over here."
"1002310","1002770"," I see. "
"1003870","1005950"," I see some bearishness on the one minute."
"1006750","1010510"," I see a little bit of bearishness on the five minute."
"1010870","1014590"," I sure as shit don't see no bearishness on the on the hourly do I."
"1016510","1017990"," So coming into Monday. "
"1018790","1019550"," What would I want to see?"
"1021170","1024550"," I'd want to see like some bearishness on the hourly."
"1027390","1029349"," What's like my prime by a dip set up."
"1030650","1033230"," I want to see some bearishness on the hourly. "
"1036550","1040910"," I don't want to see some bearishness on the five minute."
"1043270","1047450"," I don't want to see some bearishness over here."
"1048210","1051910"," We can get we can get bullish up here for a little bit but I want to see all three"
"1051910","1052690"," of these right here. "
"1054070","1057810"," So that I can go on and be like hey guess what by the fucking dip."
"1060170","1062930"," So do I buy this tip on this open on a Monday morning?"
"1063390","1063410"," Nah."
"1064510","1068730"," Race gains off to the open here currently around flat but negative on the session. "
"1069470","1070590"," What am I looking for?"
"1070930","1078590"," I'm going to be looking for these three things to be like max bearish and price to be coming into"
"1078590","1080610"," one of the triggers."
"1080610","1082610"," Like if price is right here."
"1082730","1085030"," The US stocks have struggled for direction this morning. "
"1085030","1087390"," This trade has assessed the outlook for monetary policy."
"1087650","1088050"," That's bullshit."
"1089170","1091430"," Traders ain't assessed in no monetary policy. "
"1091670","1092250"," It's crack of shit."
"1092650","1095850"," So you're looking for the interaction down here on the hourly."
"1096170","1099810"," It's the oldest longest losing streak since February. "
"1100350","1103070"," Again the gains have now been erased in the S&P."
"1103830","1108090"," I'm also if this doesn't hold I'm then looking for my daily to hold."
"1108890","1113890"," Now I can go back in time and say what I can do is go back in time and say"
"1113890","1115890"," hey let's look back here. "
"1118430","1120410"," First time we tested the daily bounce."
"1121310","1123110"," Second time we broke through it."
"1124410","1131210"," It's possible that this time when I actually go down to 403-402. "
"1132010","1133070"," It's possible now."
"1133890","1135630"," You can see the decline here."
"1135790","1136550"," There's a little bit of a bump. "
"1136590","1138430"," We've got a little bit of a cocaine snort."
"1140210","1143230"," So some areas of interest for you if you're a trader."
"1145170","1147910"," Like two major areas of interest for you as a trader. "
"1149170","1151670"," It's right around 411-01."
"1152770","1154810"," And right around 408-95."
"1157510","1160170"," And the key here is if these don't hold. "
"1160170","1166170"," If these this the hourly five minute one minute are topping still."
"1167530","1171770"," So if we come into this so if we come down here to to this."
"1172290","1174450"," Or we come down here to this. "
"1175010","1177110"," And expect to buy a dip."
"1178090","1179830"," I better not see."
"1182310","1184930"," I better not see the five minute on a high. "
"1186210","1190090"," So in time of this time now we did get the US wholesale inventory month of a month revised."

"1368970","1370770"," I'm still not in a long position."
"1374390","1376910"," I'm waiting for price to show me the way."
"1377030","1379410"," This is what's called being a price action trader. "
"1384050","1385890"," So if this reverses."
"1389960","1390980"," This goes up."

"1434440","1435940"," There's the bear plane right there."
"1438200","1440900"," The velocity is telling me to whoa wait."
"1442420","1444360"," And I got a couple targets down below. "
"1444580","1446500"," I got the hourly trigger and the daily trigger."

"1452720","1454020"," If taking a couple shots at it. "
"1455680","1457300"," So let's let me go down here."
"1457960","1460360"," And velocity is not on my side at that point."
"1463320","1465480"," Let's say velocity is not on my side. "
"1465480","1466720"," So I'm looking at velocity."

"1601850","1604850"," And you got shit on an hourly bull plane, believe it or not."

"3792600","3798780"," are at what four fucking four seventeen or something and say it for thirteen four thirteen seventy"

"7698430","7699290"," exact tick."
"7700390","7706310"," So we can look to trade, not always trade to them, but we want to be aware of them."
"7706310","7707510"," It's like a layer, right?"
"7708010","7709590"," I want to know where the triggers are. "
"7709870","7715410"," I want to know where these pivot points are, and I want to know where previous highs and lows are."
"7716030","7717950"," I want to keep track of those as a trader."
"7718890","7722010"," All three, as a trader, I want to keep track of all three of those. "
"7722770","7726870"," If you don't know how to do that, you just keep trading and over time, it'll come right to you."
"7726910","7729790"," You'll be like, I know where all these lines are, and I know what they all mean."
"7730750","7734790"," And then every time we hit one of them or blast through one of them, I erase them. "
"7734790","7739430"," Oh, for specifically the H line, if we go through one, I'll erase it."
"7739590","7744170"," So as a matter of fact, this one is gone, and I was lazy."
"7744570","7745550"," I should have deleted that one. "
"7746050","7747610"," So that one's already been taken care of."
"7747690","7754390"," We've already touched the pre-market or after hours low, okay?"
"7755070","7757150"," We already tagged the pivot point."
"7758030","7763210"," So if we start to sell here, and I'm not going to delete the pivot, but I already know that"
"7763210","7773110"," we've already hit the pre-market low or hit the extended hours pivot, we've already hit"
"7773110","7774370"," the pivot point. "
"7775030","7780550"," And so if we roll here, our next target is going to be the hourly trigger."
"7780890","7781250"," Makes sense."
"7781490","7785770"," So I'm keeping track of, hey, we hit this line, that line, this line, that line. "
"7786630","7788330"," So why do we call it the H line?"
"7788750","7795990"," Because a very good friend of the program takes time out of his day to give us some targets."
"7796630","7798530"," Like target this one, that one, this one."
"7798930","7800030"," So we call it the H line. "
"7800790","7804990"," It's kind of like a proprietary, not proprietary, but just a fun way."
"7805130","7808470"," We have things like swellers, like those are big sellers."
"7809510","7812090"," We got Jim Bros, those are young sellers. "
"7814350","7818950"," Like the Jim Bros are like a young guy or young girl that's just learning how to work out."
"7819510","7822350"," So they can sell here, but they're not that strong."
"7823010","7824850"," And then we know where the strong sellers are. "
"7824930","7828190"," Those are like the, that's like Jeff Bezos's girlfriend."
"7828690","7830770"," Like she's been working out for about five decades."
"7831610","7833810"," She's been using gear for about 10 decades. "
"7836430","7838510"," She's probably a big weightlifter."
"7841430","7842630"," I shouldn't have said that."
"7855630","7856290"," Copy right. "
"7856430","7866140"," She can sit on"
"7866140","7866760"," daddy's face."
"7871800","7876440"," Yeah, she's definitely geared up."
"7876600","7877780"," She's taking some juice, man. "
"7878100","7878600"," Without a doubt."
"7880020","7881100"," She likes to party."
"7882840","7883700"," You can tell. "
"7892440","7894120"," She definitely likes to party."
"7895740","7897520"," Well, he probably likes to party too."
"7910610","7911770"," Everybody likes to party. "
"7912470","7919950"," I got like, there's like a part of it where I'm like, there's a part of around like, oh, yeah,"
"7920050","7921250"," we're trying to sell right now."
"7922150","7922930"," Sellers, man."
"7923090","7927330"," They're just like, oh, yeah, let's just start playing bear music here. "
"7929170","7930130"," Oh, yeah."
"7932530","7934530"," Digital Canadian dollar isn't needed."
"7934930","7938310"," The decision to issue a digital Canadian dollar is up to lawmakers. "
"7939910","7945430"," This like, I want to make a ton of jokes probably in really bad taste."
"7946870","7948730"," Of course, I can't make those jokes."
"7962220","7967000"," But, you know, like he could have any woman he wants. "
"7967300","7967980"," You know that, right?"
"7968800","7973740"," So he could pull a, he could pull a, what's that guy?"
"7973960","7974200"," What's that?"
"7974880","7975360"," Not Matt Damon."
"7975860","7976260"," Matt Damon."
"7978040","7981400"," The one guy that's like all his girlfriends are under the age of 23. "
"7983560","7985060"," Like he could have any girl he wants."
"7985480","7986140"," You know that, right?"
"7986440","7994360"," Like, Bezos could just be like, Bezos could just walk around with a harem of 18 year old girls and"
"7994360","7995400"," he could do whatever fuck he wants."
"7998120","8001040"," I'm assuming that I always sell my wife. "
"8001400","8006100"," Sometimes my wife will be like, or not my wife, but I'll talk."
"8006400","8012500"," I'll be like, I'll ask her because I'm getting older and I'm like, like as you get older, like you"
"8012500","8014740"," start hitting your 30s and your 40s and stuff."
"8014960","8020740"," Not this isn't for everybody, but for me, like 30s, 40s, I'm like, yeah. "
"8022600","8027540"," I'm like, I don't find a girl that's like, when I'm like 20s, I find a young girl cute and"
"8027540","8027960"," all that stuff."
"8028180","8031860"," But, like you do your 30s and you're like, man, I don't even find college girls cute anymore."
"8032640","8036060"," And, you know, they look like kids and stuff. "
"8038200","8041740"," And, uh, they act like, like, and that's I ask people that I'm like, what are you going to do?"
"8041880","8045080"," Are you going to, are you going to have sex with her and then take her to the ice cream"
"8045080","8045440"," shop?"
"8046360","8047780"," Like afterwards, what are you going to do?"
"8047780","8048360"," Take her to her movie?"
"8048620","8051000"," Like, what do you have in common with someone that's that age?"
"8052040","8055220"," You know, when you're like 30s and 40s and she got nothing in common with these girls."
"8056060","8059760"," It's like, if you're going to, if you're going to have a relationship with them, you kind of want"
"8059760","8060940"," to be able to talk to them."
"8062020","8069140"," So you're like, kind of want to be the near, like near same age and same decade, decade away, maybe"
"8069140","8071420"," at most, at least an adult. "
"8071700","8072160"," How about that?"
"8072820","8073780"," Can I get an adult?"
"8076180","8082140"," You know, can I get like an adult conversation and, you know, like, if you're 35 to 30, you're not"
"8082140","8087300"," going to have an adult conversation with an 18 year old girl."
"8088220","8089900"," You have nothing in common with that girl."
"8089980","8090260"," I'm sorry. "
"8090640","8094200"," Even if she's legal, you don't have anything in common with that girl."
"8098680","8099280"," It's gross."
"8101480","8102840"," It's not just, well, it's not gross. "
"8103100","8108340"," I get the, I understand, like, I understand the, oh, that, you know, like, I don't know, that 20"
"8108340","8109360"," year old girl's cute, I guess."
"8109580","8111760"," But let's be honest, like, it's kind of gross."
"8112260","8114220"," And what are you going to talk to her about?"
"8114360","8116280"," You got nothing to tell that girl about. "
"8117300","8121780"," So like, if Bezos with some girl that looks or that's older like she is, I understand that."
"8122080","8128520"," Like, he probably wants to at least have some pillow talk or a rational con, an adult conversation"
"8128520","8130720"," with somebody."
"8132100","8133640"," I forget what his name has. "
"8133820","8135800"," The girlfriends are like 18 or 24 some."
"8136440","8137160"," I couldn't do it."
"8138480","8143620"," The other thing too is, for me personally, now this, this I, this I can understand. "
"8144680","8148400"," Some guys are like, I find the young girl hot still."
"8148600","8149620"," I'm like, I'm 40 years old."
"8149680","8151100"," I still find a 22 year old girl. "
"8151760","8154340"," I'm like, okay, personally me."
"8155080","8157420"," As I get older, I find older women hot."
"8157700","8159140"," Like, the older you get as women. "
"8159900","8160880"," I think you're smoking."
"8160980","8162260"," Like, I'm like, she's hot."
"8162900","8164180"," I don't know why I don't know if it's me. "
"8165760","8170380"," I don't know what it is, but like, a woman that's older."
"8171300","8175960"," As I've gotten older, I've found older women to be extremely attractive."
"8176880","8179680"," I don't know why. "
"8179920","8185380"," I don't know what that is, but that's me personally."
"8185660","8188640"," So, that like, to each zone, I guess on that."
"8188860","8193160"," So I got no like, you're an older guy out there and you like a younger woman or something, I"
"8193160","8193480"," get it. "
"8194400","8197160"," You can't argue that you have something in common with the younger woman."
"8197160","8201860"," They're like, that part, we, we, if you're going to try to tell me like, if I meet you and"
"8201860","8205379"," you get an eight to 20 year old girlfriend, and you try to tell me that you have something in"
"8205379","8207080"," common with her and be like, get the fuck out of here."
"8208160","8210879"," Just be honest and be like, I think younger women are hot. "
"8213780","8215639"," Maybe you do have something in common with her."
"8215719","8216260"," I think that's crazy."
"8218280","8222600"," But do that, do you like a, I don't know, man, as I get older, I'm like, you know, like"
"8224299","8226780"," it probably shouldn't be talking about that shit in a stream, should I?"
"8229219","8230700"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"8230860","8237520"," I mean, like, you're like, if you're 30 years old, you know, like I'm like age, like age, like,"
"8237700","8240020"," like, you know, I feel like 30, 40 years old, I think they're hot."
"8240160","8241020"," Yeah, definitely."
"8241820","8246080"," If I was, if I was looking at a girl that was 22 years old, standing next to a woman"
"8246080","8250180"," that's like 30 or 40, yeah, man, I find a 30 or 40 year old way hotter"
"8250180","8258920"," than a woman. "
"8258920","8261500"," Like they're, I don't know, when you get older, you see this shit."
"8261680","8263740"," You're like, you can see that a woman's a woman."
"8264900","8265879"," Like, that's a woman. "
"8266940","8271840"," A boy topic, I know."
"8277660","8282400"," Yeah, it's so someone here in chats on YouTube saying, when I was younger, I liked younger than me."
"8282680","8284280"," No, no, someone said I liked him older. "
"8285440","8288600"," I liked, I liked older women or now I know now I like younger women or something like that."
"8289059","8289780"," I don't know what to say."
"8289879","8291000"," I liked older when I was younger. "
"8291139","8292860"," Now I like younger than me, less headache."
"8293480","8295879"," Yes, I can't come, I can't argue with that ds."
"8296980","8297940"," To each his own. "
"8299340","8302760"," To each his own, but I like, I like an old woman."
"8302860","8303240"," I like them."
"8303940","8305000"," I feel like an old woman. "
"8305559","8306660"," They're more confident."
"8306660","8307700"," They've been through a lot more."
"8308219","8309200"," They know what they want. "
"8310260","8314100"," They're not oppressed by societal bullshit that they have to go through."
"8314320","8318020"," I feel like women go through a ton of crazy shit."
"8318200","8321340"," Like, like our society puts so much weight on them. "
"8322440","8325120"," Like weight on the look good and also their stupid shit."
"8325260","8329340"," Like, you got to, you have to take care of the kids and you have to work and you have"
"8329340","8332160"," to look good and you have to present yourself a certain way."
"8332360","8336900"," And for me, I feel like as women get older, oftentimes they're like, fuck all that shit. "
"8337540","8338600"," I don't have to do that for anybody."
"8339379","8344360"," I find that, I find that, probably shouldn't be talking about that."
"8344420","8345200"," I'll just abort the conversation. "
"8351820","8353299"," They always like the older women."
"8354100","8354920"," Abort abort."
"8364920","8368240"," Keanu Reeves and Alexander Grant, granted that she's older. "
"8368480","8370520"," Yeah, I'd like some pillow talk."
"8371299","8371940"," I would."
"8372059","8372920"," I'd like some pillow talk. "
"8373360","8378100"," I'd like some pillow talk."
"8378680","8385059"," The only thing I'm not into is I'm not into like, um, I'm not into like the plastic surgery that"
"8385059","8386459"," looks like plastic surgery."
"8386459","8387400"," I'm not any of that stuff. "
"8388120","8390900"," Like when you look like you're like, like you can see it."
"8392320","8395060"," Um, I'm not out of that either."
"8395280","8396620"," I mean, it's like more of a natural woman. "
"8401460","8405580"," People in the stream are like, people in the stream are like, well, he'll, we can probably hang"
"8405580","8405800"," out."
"8405840","8406620"," He won't like my wife."
"8407220","8410640"," Other people in the stream are like, definitely not letting him meet my wife. "
"8415660","8418580"," Yeah, yeah, we talked about EMD earlier."
"8418940","8422620"," I have, we talked about, we've been talking about EMD for days now, right?"
"8423200","8423880"," It's not over."
"8424100","8425540"," It's going to last five to six session. "
"8425740","8427780"," Oh, I said it'll last up to 12 sessions, I think."
"8429180","8430500"," We already called that one out."
"8432720","8435160"," We call them out before, never after around here. "
"8440950","8444550"," I'm dating a 26 year old and a 30 year old at the same time, those dad together, right?"
"8446630","8446990"," Sure."
"8453830","8455650"," We could go, you can meet my wife."
"8455870","8457530"," She's an autonomous person and can make decisions. "
"8462030","8463110"," Uh, good question."
"8463330","8464970"," Sly Rabbit's asking, is this going to be a thing today?"
"8465150","8466970"," There's a lot of rotation going on right now."
"8469230","8472910"," Or my view, there is, I'm looking around the market right now, and I'm like, dude, there's like,"
"8473090","8476930"," there's like shit that looks like there's stuff going on in the market that looks like the market"
"8476930","8478290"," should crash the depths of hell. "
"8479150","8481790"," And then they're like, now we're going to buy a bunch of this shit over here."
"8482070","8484490"," So there's a lot of rotation going on."
"8498930","8499330"," Joe. "
"8499330","8500170"," Joe Donut."
"8506710","8511330"," All the, everyone that knows the woman I like is, uh, they're all like confidence in their wives."
"8511610","8514050"," They're like, they're like, my wife's never getting with you, man. "
"8514730","8516830"," I know exactly who you like."
"8516970","8518070"," That's the same kind of woman I like."
"8519690","8521210"," This is the same with my wife too. "
"8532810","8539490"," My wife's like the kind of woman like, I'll take her somewhere and we'll go out somewhere."
"8539810","8541130"," We'll have to go to some event or something."
"8542350","8545830"," You know, it's like, it's like, if it's like somewhere having a lot of fun, these aren't, like kids"
"8545830","8550110"," aren't there like, go somewhere having a good old time, whatever. "
"8550310","8552390"," And like, you know, like somebody's hitting on your wife or something."
"8553750","8555470"," We don't actually wear wedding rings either."
"8556710","8557790"," We don't wear wedding bands. "
"8559550","8562470"," Now she's got a wedding band and a rock and all that."
"8562550","8563090"," We don't wear them."
"8565610","8569710"," We started buying houses and we were rehabbing them ourselves. "
"8571710","8576830"," And so we stopped wearing jewelry because you can rip your finger off."
"8578670","8581550"," And so we stopped wearing jewelry."
"8581990","8585870"," I still wear a watch, but I don't wear any rings. "
"8585870","8589110"," I don't want to rip my like, these sleeve, my fingers or anything."
"8589710","8591410"," And I don't want to get my finger blown up either."
"8591950","8595670"," Matter of fact, I just did a bunch of electrical work on a house that I bought. "
"8596510","8600090"," And you can catch an arc and blow your finger right off your hand, right?"
"8603490","8605430"," So we'll go out and we don't wear rings."
"8606470","8611730"," And so people don't know, you know, they don't know we're married or something, or they don't see"
"8611730","8612410"," us hanging out together."
"8612690","8614170"," We get like, she'll go off and do her thing. "
"8614310","8615130"," I'll go off and do my thing."
"8615990","8620890"," We'll meet people and or someone will like hit an otter or something in front of me."
"8621650","8624850"," And then sometimes they're aggressive too. "
"8624990","8626750"," Like sometimes you like meet someone that's aggressive."
"8626890","8630210"," Not this rare now, but there was a time when it's pretty common."
"8631050","8637130"," They had to catch a kick out of it because I was like, or they would be scared or they'd"
"8637130","8639430"," find out and be like, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know it was your wife or something. "
"8639890","8641630"," It didn't matter how it played itself out."
"8641630","8642610"," Some guys are aggressive."
"8643490","8650830"," But even like, especially the aggressive guys, I just feel like, man, you can have her like you can"
"8650830","8652130"," always you want to take her home. "
"8652750","8653810"," She's yours, bro."
"8654430","8660070"," Cause I'm like, you know, you do realize she's got two children and a couple dogs and a lot of"
"8660070","8660450"," expenses."
"8662430","8664470"," You know, you want to pull take that on. "
"8664570","8665490"," It's all yours like."
"8669990","8670390"," Yeah."
"8673050","8673730"," Then they're like, what do you mean?"
"8673790","8674310"," She's got kids. "
"8674590","8676030"," I'm like, yeah, she's got two daughters, man."
"8676830","8678170"," Full package deal."
"8682610","8684230"," You got to take care of all of them. "
"8684370","8685170"," Probably me too."
"8686790","8688910"," I'll be coming living in your basement or something."
"8691770","8695910"," Oh, dude, bull's taking over again, just bouncing back and forth right now. "
"8696070","8696650"," What's going to happen?"
"8700650","8701850"," Maybe I'm just getting older."
"8706010","8711610"," I mean, like, I think like when you're younger, you're like, you're always afraid of that like, is"
"8711610","8714790"," my wife going to cheat on me or that kind of shit?"
"8714910","8716650"," I know young people go through that shit all the time."
"8716850","8718030"," Like, does she love me?"
"8719910","8723730"," I mean, as I get older, like, yeah, I'm not as concerned with it. "
"8723850","8726910"," Like if she cheated on me, she wants to be with somebody else, she wants to be with somebody else."
"8728330","8729670"," I mean, I can't stop that."
"8730850","8736290"," You know, like if she doesn't love me anymore or, you know, she's like, I want a different life or"
"8736290","8737910"," hey, we're doing different things. "
"8738190","8744550"," It's kind of one of the keys to fall in love with somebody is a life lesson for young men"
"8744550","8744990"," out there."
"8745210","8746290"," Black Sea on Friday."
"8749910","8751510"," There's a good life lesson here. "
"8752030","8752810"," You meet somebody."
"8753570","8758290"," I think this applies to, I don't care if you're like, uh, straight gay, bisexual."
"8758450","8758690"," I don't care. "
"8758850","8762030"," Like, if you're in a relationship, you're like, you're in a relationship with somebody you love."
"8762850","8764110"," This is a life lesson."
"8767390","8770290"," Sometimes, or if you meet somebody, you become their friend, right?"
"8770690","8773650"," You lust after them because you think they're hot and become good friends. "

"8790980","8792620"," Looking for a squeeze higher still."
"8794680","8796040"," Can we get the yellow box?"
"8796260","8797300"," Can we get the each line?"
"8798100","8798620"," Looks like it."
"8799840","8801860"," Cell side getting run over right now. "
"8802740","8805040"," Um, here's a life lesson."
"8806320","8809020"," I'm going to tell you something, if you're young out there listening right now, right?"
"8809320","8813020"," This is going to make all the difference in your life and your brain is not going to listen to"
"8813020","8818660"," this, but like, let's say you're lusting after somebody and then you're like, oh yeah, we're going"
"8818660","8819540"," to lust after each other."
"8819680","8820480"," Then you become friends. "
"8820620","8821420"," This is another key."
"8821920","8824360"," Like, for a long term relationship, you want to be their friend."
"8825460","8826580"," Uh, you want to, you do. "
"8826940","8830000"," Like, it makes life so much easier when you like, have things in common."
"8830620","8836140"," You come from similar backgrounds, not required, but if you ask anyone with a sociology degree,"
"8836620","8841960"," statistically, if they have like a similar background than as you like, we experienced the same,"
"8841960","8842980"," the same things as kids."
"8844240","8847040"," Uh, they tend to turn into long term relationships. "
"8848300","8850660"," Getting some bull alerts right now to the upside."
"8851660","8853420"," Bull alerts right now to the upside."
"8854240","8858480"," Um, but the key point that we don't have to, but the key point is like, if you like, you"
"8858480","8859200"," then become friends. "
"8860500","8863040"," Um, and let's say you have things in common."
"8864160","8867740"," You should, you should have some things in common."
"8868040","8868900"," Like, I enjoy this. "
"8869060","8869740"," You enjoy this."
"8870640","8872040"," We put some ears together."
"8873160","8877840"," Now, the key that to this is they're going to, they're going to be times in your life when you're"
"8877840","8885160"," in a relationship where you don't have the same things in common or your interests diverge. "
"8886120","8889320"," Like, hey, I like to, I don't know, I like the color blue and you like the color blue."
"8889980","8891180"," And then five years later."
"8892480","8893560"," Five years later. "
"8894560","8898860"," Uh, I like the color green and he or she likes the color yellow."
"8899620","8902220"," Uh, we don't like the same color anymore."
"8902560","8908860"," Which rating says the economic recovery slows across US states and tax revenue goes, stores in"
"8908860","8910420"," California and New York. "
"8912440","8916160"," If you can stay together and enjoy different things, all the better."
"8916440","8922520"," If you can't, uh, if you can't enjoy different things and stay together, or if you don't want to"
"8922520","8930040"," explore what she likes or she, what you likes or he, whatever, um, you know, you have to let that"
"8930040","8930360"," go."
"8930640","8931160"," Does that make sense?"
"8931640","8936180"," So, like, if you're, if you loved one wants to go off and cheat or your loved one wants to"
"8936180","8940940"," wants a different experience or something like that, don't waste your fucking time. "
"8944340","8945600"," Life is too short."
"8947960","8948820"," This is my point."
"8949680","8950180"," Does that make sense?"
"8950580","8956040"," Because you're probably like, hey, now I like yellow and she likes green and we don't, we're just"
"8956040","8957180"," separating different ways. "
"8957900","8959060"," You can go find some of the likes yellow."
"8959520","8961600"," There's a bunch of women or men out there that like yellow too."
"8962380","8962880"," Does that make sense?"
"8964020","8968220"," Uh, but some people can stay together even if they have different, different, um, uh, if their"
"8968220","8971300"," interests change over time, but some people can't get over that. "
"8975370","8985340"," Some people want, some people want, uh, like, let's say, let's say my wife likes the color"
"8985340","8986700"," green and I like the color yellow now."
"8987700","8988380"," She might not."
"8988940","8992000"," Let's say I'm like, no, I'm never going to like that color green and I don't have no interest. "
"8992300","8994740"," She might be like, well, I'm going to go find someone that does like the color green."
"8995960","8999720"," If you can recognize that, you live a much happier life."
"9000220","9009310"," You know, if you have to move on space, yeah, it does look like space invaders, doesn't it?"
"9013400","9014140"," You know what I mean?"
"9014280","9022040"," Like some, like, matter of fact, I got a close friend and his, his, his close friend is getting"
"9022040","9023200"," bent right over right now. "
"9025000","9027820"," I'm like, man, let that shit go."
"9028020","9028900"," Like, just move on."
"9029500","9030740"," Like, just move on. "
"9034540","9036120"," Just plain blank telling you."
"9048560","9058640"," Yeah, I can't say that, um, I can't say that, um, spy"
"9058640","9059780"," pump room and couples counseling."
"9061580","9070940"," Yeah, I agree. "
"9071180","9075820"," Like people should never stop growing, but individual growth can create conflict or not conflict"
"9075820","9076500"," friction."
"9077020","9078940"," Like individual growth can definitely."
"9079380","9083420"," The one thing that I try to do with my wife or my wife and I try to do, I'll"
"9083420","9088480"," be honest, is have some fucking interest in what the other person is doing. "
"9088480","9095380"," I'm being be honest with you for the one thing that's probably saved us is, um, kind of being"
"9095380","9096780"," interested in the same stuff."
"9098580","9106600"," Uh, and if our interests change that we are open to whatever they're interested in, like have like,"
"9106720","9109580"," if my wife's like, I don't like the color blue anymore."
"9109580","9111200"," And I now like the color green. "
"9111720","9113220"," And I'm like, I like blue."
"9114600","9115800"," We'll be like, yeah, you know what?"
"9116000","9117460"," Show me what's up with that green over there."
"9119320","9121080"," So like, if you want to keep your loved one. "
"9122280","9127380"," So if you're like, if you're like, well, my loved one is now interested in green and not, not blue"
"9127380","9127960"," anymore cap."
"9128360","9129000"," What do I do?"
"9129000","9133820"," I would recommend that you start fucking trying out green."
"9134560","9137820"," If you do that, she'll probably stay with you. "
"9140560","9141940"," It's good point, leaky."
"9146840","9147480"," Yeah."
"9152620","9154500"," So bebop saying I've been married four times. "
"9154500","9156440"," So as my husband, both widowed twice."
"9156960","9158700"," So you have something in common, right?"
"9159960","9161260"," Does that work for you?"
"9161620","9163380"," I bet that I would assume that it does."
"9164260","9167740"," If I was widowed twice, I'd probably be looking for something similar. "
"9168100","9171760"," So if someone has something common, we can understand, identify with what I've gone through."
"9178230","9179790"," That's another good point."
"9180010","9181930"," Uh, Devin's saying take a long trip with somebody. "
"9183130","9184430"," Yeah, long trips work."
"9186110","9188130"," Living with somebody works too, right?"
"9190790","9194970"," Like I couldn't, but I can't believe people like never live with each other and getting married."
"9194970","9195630"," I'm like, what?"
"9197830","9204130"," We need more Jerry. "
"9206210","9209310"," Oh, no, I got Alex in trouble."
"9210050","9212950"," Alex's wife is like, I told you, start liking green."
"9231880","9233340"," Yeah, Andrew is making a good point. "
"9234100","9237640"," Keeping an open mind for sure, and at least trying out what the other person likes instead of like"
"9237640","9238780"," instant rejection or resisting."
"9239620","9242180"," Yeah, I think that shit just leads to the lingers."
"9242280","9243700"," Andrew's making a great point, or Andrea. "
"9244240","9247660"," I don't know how she pronounced their name, but I agree with that."
"9248380","9252640"," Like, at least be open to it, or at least be like, Hey, if you, I don't like this, but"
"9252640","9253860"," you do have fun with it."
"9255500","9262020"," Got a bare minimum, but like the full on like, yeah, we ain't doing that at all. "
"9263000","9264760"," That doesn't fucking fly."
"9265800","9267400"," This shit causes fucking resentment."
"9269960","9275100"," Let me, we should run a pole winky and find out what these bears are thinking. "
"9275100","9276960"," These bears are relentless right now."
"9280340","9282180"," Like south side rage right here."
"9294790","9296990"," No, no, no, I'm still in calls right now. "
"9299350","9300370"," I'm sitting in them."
"9305970","9306810"," Yeah, that's another."
"9307090","9308330"," So who brought that up in there?"
"9308470","9310210"," Alexander saying, go camping with someone. "
"9310610","9310930"," You know what?"
"9311190","9316410"," I found with my my my my men friends, my male friends."
"9317710","9323190"," A very easy way to classify them is to go hiking with them, like through hiking."
"9324830","9330550"," You can find out real fast, like, I can trust this guy with this stuff and I can trust that"
"9330550","9331250"," guy with that stuff. "
"9331810","9332930"," Go to Burning Man."
"9334150","9335150"," That's another good one."
"9335310","9340050"," Go to Burning Man with some friends, and you'll find out who are the freeloaders and who actually"
"9340050","9340710"," do shit. "
"9351610","9357090"," I'm just going to drink it away like in our day and age, right?"
"9357350","9358550"," Like one of the first world countries."
"9359430","9369450"," I'm just going to drink it away."
"9380000","9385040"," He bop says, uh, my aunt and uncle were married 72 years, had eight kids. "
"9385660","9387940"," I once asked my aunt to you ever think of divorce."
"9387940","9388860"," And she said every day."
"9389340","9391620"," They both had a great sense of humor, which I think is most important. "
"9391860","9392460"," I agree with that too."
"9393620","9395000"," But I think fighting is fine too."
"9395140","9397400"," So I've had my friends and I have always talked about this. "
"9397480","9399540"," I've had friends that are like, I've never once fought my wife."
"9401620","9403780"," I have other friends that like I fight with her all the time."
"9405040","9407480"," I think fighting is normal part of relationship. "
"9408720","9412860"," Personally, I don't mean like you don't beat each other up or any of that kind of shit, any abuse"
"9412860","9415060"," or anything, but like disagreeing."
"9415600","9419440"," I always feel like it's I always feel like I've got a little lot of shit slide and then some"
"9419440","9421760"," shit I don't and like that shit that I don't let slide."
"9421760","9424340"," I just I just don't interact about it. "
"9425680","9427700"," I'm just like, no."
"9432320","9437640"," I think I think for or at least our dynamics, most dynamics I've had with women that I've done"
"9437640","9443080"," better when I don't argue about a bunch of stuff and then the like the one or two or three"
"9443080","9444180"," things that are important to me."
"9445520","9446340"," They mean more. "
"9451870","9452370"," Hey, David."
"9452530","9452930"," How you doing, man?"
"9453770","9454750"," I did not look at Chewy."
"9454750","9455610"," Let's look at it right now. "
"9460070","9460990"," Let me take a look, brother."
"9476740","9477060"," Chewy."
"9477720","9478200"," Excuse me. "
"9484630","9486170"," So I like Chewy here."
"9487470","9488450"," Let's look at Chewy real quick."
"9488550","9488790"," I like it. "
"9488850","9489450"," It's a good, good call."
"9489890","9490350"," Good shout out."
"9490470","9490910"," Hold on a second. "
"9492590","9493610"," Let's talk about Chewy."
"9495010","9504760"," That cool app"
"9504760","9505880"," can't have frame."
"9506140","9506820"," We can rid of that one. "
"9535120","9535680"," CHWY."
"9541540","9543560"," Okay, so we're going to look at multiple time frames."
"9546420","9552100"," I always like seeing this right here for a bull trade. "
"9553720","9555560"," I always like selling."
"9556580","9558400"," So like sell this right here."
"9559980","9561340"," Buy this right here. "
"9563460","9564240"," Makes sense."
"9565260","9566900"," It hasn't topped yet, right?"
"9568700","9573020"," This is actually a max bullishness right now on Chewy."
"9598430","9599230"," Hold on a second. "
"9599390","9600510"," Let me look at the background somewhere else."
"9600630","9601270"," I want to check another chart."
"9613430","9615430"," I'm going to get stopped out here in just a minute. "
"9615430","9615750"," I know that."
"9623720","9624780"," There's a wrong chart."
"9625940","9632270"," I got the wrong chart here. "
"9650200","9654880"," So in geopolitics, China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have agreed to expand cooperation."

"9692620","9694940"," Coming into resistance right now."
"9703940","9714740"," Price target above $37.54. It has to hold $32.81. It's"
"9714740","9721200"," on a five trigger cluster or a four trigger cluster to break above."
"9721340","9722600"," It's daily trigger. "
"9722780","9724340"," If it breaks above, it's daily trigger."
"9724960","9726340"," Expect a kiss back."
"9728940","9730480"," So watch my cursor here. "
"9731580","9741040"," Expect a move to like $34.50. There's a second trade in here."
"9744350","9746190"," When the hourly comes up."
"9746750","9755690"," So you're going to be looking for a squeeze above to $34.50. You want to see it hold $33 "
"9755690","9763750",".54. If it can hold $33.54, price target"
"9763750","9766570"," $37 flat. "
"9769550","9770270"," Make sense?"
"9770810","9773550"," So let me chart it out for you."
"9777270","9808050"," At each"
"9808050","9814950"," level, if any of these like supports as you go up breaks, the trade, the player, the trade would be"
"9814950","9815190"," dead."
"9818310","9819550"," Something like that, a failure. "
"9821030","9822230"," Then I move this way right here."
"9827140","9829380"," You're going to expect the hourly to come right up on it."
"9832240","9834800"," The play is dead below. "
"9837240","9838860"," The play is not dead."
"9848690","9856870"," Trade is dead below $33.67. Like a rejection."
"9858250","9868090"," So the idea here would be if you trade up here and it's rejected and there's a"
"9868090","9877720"," confirmation rejection, like it can go up here and dip and then go up there. "

"12106340","12107700"," Young travel here dude."
"12108900","12114600"," This year specifically I went to go start the spring off by going to the range."
"12115580","12118840"," I'm paying more money at the range than I am playing around a golf. "
"12124320","12126660"," So I just stopped and started playing golf."
"12126660","12131360"," But this year specifically the range is ridiculously expensive."
"12134800","12138900"," And the crazy part is I'm like well how is inflation hate you?"
"12140840","12143320"," I'm like range balls haven't changed in price. "
"12143420","12144320"," I even looked it up."
"12145320","12150160"," I'm like maybe some maybe some of the maybe some of the wage inflation."
"12152100","12156900"," I guess maybe maybe maintenance and care of the course fertilizers out of control the price"
"12156900","12157260"," fertilizer. "
"12159560","12163600"," But the range is as expensive as going to play around a golf for me."
"12183040","12187520"," Yeah I was trying to figure out what the reason I mean we're talking like substantial increases in"
"12187520","12194980"," in playing around versus it used to be like you know you go to play playing a bucket of balls"
"12194980","12196200"," and it was cheap."
"12196420","12198560"," You can get out there you work on your swing all that kind of stuff. "
"12203060","12207560"," And this year I'm just like I'm like I'm spending more at the range than I am."
"12209420","12210800"," Uh on a course."
"12226580","12227920"," Yeah labor is money. "
"12247480","12248780"," New high on NQ."
"12280230","12284530"," So far than it's now to the top of the hour where we expect comments from EU Commission Vice"
"12284530","12288190"," President Vestiger and German economy Minister Habek."
"12291110","12295570"," 30% increase in the cost of labor at the lowest wage jobs in the past few years. "
"12296370","12299850"," Yeah, I'm a, you know what it reminded me of?"
"12299990","12300850"," He already reminds me of."
"12301450","12302970"," So Joe's making a good point."
"12304570","12310230"," Joe's saying a 30% increase in the cost of labor at the lowest wage jobs in the past few"
"12310230","12310530"," years. "
"12310610","12315750"," So that's to the point of like McDonald's, right?"
"12316410","12320530"," I was just reading some articles of about like why does McDonald's cost so much?"
"12321330","12322830"," I've heard all kinds of arguments."
"12322830","12325470"," I've heard like fast casual."
"12327030","12331650"," Like I guess the McDonald's CEO is like we can charge more so we do. "
"12334510","12338370"," And we're just going to, we're just going to upper prices to what fast casual people pay for"
"12338370","12338730"," eating."
"12339530","12343430"," So I think fast casual is like a Applebee's type restaurant."
"12345130","12350970"," But I don't eat fast food generally do most or some of the health benefits, but also do the price. "
"12352190","12354970"," Each time I've gone out to eat fast food, I'm like, this is ridiculous."
"12355470","12356950"," I'll just get a steak and eat that."
"12359750","12363050"," But I think Joe's making a fair point here. "
"12363190","12367350"," Like the I think it's a valid point, but I don't know that it's the entire answer."
"12368330","12372150"," Yeah, I guess the CEO from McDonald's is like fuck that we can just we'll just charge we don't"
"12372150","12372370"," care."

"12387550","12396330"," She's doing the her her wage increases every year are basically following fake inflation."
"12402000","12404880"," No, no massive increase in her salary. "

"13789020","13795340"," So we have to get above that 220 we keep talking about, like, it needs to still trade above this"
"13795340","13795600"," 220. "
"13809300","13819980"," This thesis would be dead below 143 below 143,"
"13819980","13829780"," you're looking for a target of $55.89. But, you know, this is, you got a higher low here, higher"
"13829780","13833960"," low here, this is a pretty significant sell-off for Tesla down here at this purple line."
"13836060","13844200"," So I mean, the thesis here is we're coming into the daily trigger on Tesla, we have the weekly"
"13844200","13847620"," above, I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here."
"13848880","13854820"," Right now, as long as Tesla holds 142, the way is, 142.84, the way is still up. "
"13856620","13858760"," Your next target, like, is 186."
"13859420","13868880"," We know that this has been a big fight already, that 186 number, but then 216.32 is your next"
"13868880","13869220"," one."
"13874790","13880670"," And I'm like, I'm calling 300 to close this gap right here, but there's nothing saying it can't go"
"13880670","13882050"," back to all-time highs at 400. "
"13882590","13886950"," So from the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Ambassador to China burns, told their Chinese foreign"
"13886950","13891110"," minister that there has been no change to the U.S. as one China policy."
"13891630","13895550"," I mean, there could be some range-bound action between this 220 and 300."
"13896710","13898450"," And then finally, you make the leg up here. "
"13901430","13909630"," You know, time's not on your side once they cut rates, but bulls in the, or balls in the bulls"
"13909630","13931680"," court right now, 30-minute chart, you"
"13931680","13936900"," know, just like this 30-minute chart, like, this is what you want to see."
"13940240","13943740"," Extreme bearishness on the daily, on the weekly, on the monthly."
"13944720","13951920"," Hourly is not so good for the bulls here, but the hourly is not saying, like, in the next few"
"13951920","13953220"," weeks, what's going to happen at Tesla. "
"13953220","13963140"," So, even if Tesla has some momentary weakness, it looks like"
"13963140","13964220"," it's going to explode right now."
"13964320","13965580"," It's about to rip some faces off."
"13967420","13976940"," The hourly is coming up onto the daily, target above 186, but just overall, like the"
"13976940","13987120"," coming weeks through summer, and this could be a driver for NASDAQ and for the SPX, for"
"13987120","13988720"," spy, for SP500. "
"13990040","13999160"," Your next target above, again, 217.25, 286.99, 217, but you've got clear skies above,"
"13999900","14006080"," and you start getting these, you start getting, like, the hour, the one, the five, the hour, the"
"14006080","14012340"," daily, the weekly on your side, and that four trigger will destroy that monthly."
"14015520","14031410"," So, unless we trade below that 142, which we failed to do at this point, which we"
"14031410","14038930"," failed to do, my posit here is that, if you had NVIDIA leading the way in Apple, that you might"
"14038930","14041990"," be looking towards these high beta stocks to lead the way."
"14044690","14052250"," So, like NVIDIA might do well, but you've got, like, Netflix trades like a high beta right now, and"
"14052250","14056750"," Tesla, I've been watching Tesla against SPX and NASDAQ. "
"14058170","14065290"," Like, sometimes it trades to spy, and sometimes it doesn't, but it's been very beta-esque, like,"
"14065290","14069010"," it's been very, like, meme-ish, more so than usual."
"14069870","14075030"," And whenever it does that, whenever it starts to show, like, it's, it's own, like, it's not trading"
"14075030","14077770"," to the market, I'm like, man, this is when we start making stupid moves."
"14088280","14093840"," So Tesla on a higher time frame, so let's just talk about a higher time frame. "
"14094520","14101880"," So Tesla on a higher time frame, talking like months, quarters, fractal waves going back to the"
"14101880","14109760"," beginning of its life as an individual ticker, it looks extremely bullish."
"14113890","14123270"," And then the volume buying of it from institutions, they'll sell fucking burning tires"
"14123270","14125270"," after a nuclear war if they can."
"14127810","14133170"," So, you know, like, when a company sometimes every has every reason to go down to the, like, unless"
"14133170","14141070"," it's fraud, even if it's legal fraud, like, we lied to you about something, they'll make a fucking"
"14141070","14141950"," market out of anything. "
"14143090","14153150"," And sometimes it's when it's at its worst, it's at its worst, like,"
"14153290","14157310"," public consensus, or sentiment in the market."
"14160650","14166110"," So, so, you know, and what you find out later on is that they actually bought it, and now they're"
"14166110","14167150"," going to sell into you."
"14178820","14183360"," So it like, so, and I want you to know, like, I'm a Tesla bull that wants to buy Tesla"
"14183360","14187860"," at 50 bucks, 60 bucks, that's my, that's my case. "
"14188200","14190300"," I'm not, I'm not happy at all with Tesla right now."
"14190300","14193420"," I'm not a fan of what Tesla's doing with that, what it hasn't delivered on."
"14194100","14195640"," My expectations are through the roof. "
"14196680","14199260"," I don't care what any Tesla, dude, take Tesla bulls."
"14200080","14208240"," I love you guys, but I've got nothing for you right now, or from my love for Tesla and what"
"14208240","14212820"," I want Tesla to become, and I want them to keep up with companies that are catching up to them."
"14212860","14219420"," I have high expectations, and I am not the Tesla bull that's like, everything is fucking fine. "
"14220440","14229120"," So, like, I have high expectations of a growth company, and if you don't meet those expectations, I"
"14229120","14237000"," want the price to go down, but, but saying that the stock market is completely different than"
"14237000","14237200"," Tesla."
"14238100","14241720"," The stock market is a completely different thing, right, and it has to do with the value of a"
"14241720","14248200"," company and forward ratios and shit like that, things being priced in, but when I saw that"
"14248200","14254420"," accumulation, man, and the worst part is, is that publicly, everything that I read was like, oh,"
"14254620","14259460"," the dip was just a short squeeze, and it was just a dip bought by retail, and it's Cathy Woods"
"14259460","14265060"," and all this other fucking nonsense, I'm like, those fucking billions of dollars of Tesla stock"
"14265060","14267220"," that was bought, and it wasn't by Cathy Woods."
"14275100","14278320"," So on paper, everything is telling me, Tesla should go to 50 bucks. "
"14278320","14288300"," And then when I'm looking at some other stuff, I'm like, I'm going counter to my, I'm going"
"14288300","14294580"," counter to my, the data is saying otherwise, data is saying that it's going up."
"14315880","14323780"," Now, right now, like, if Tesla, you know, like, Tesla holds that 142, that thesis is alive that"
"14323780","14324500"," it's going to 300."
"14326060","14333740"," The Tesla breaks that 142, I'll start taking that bearish thesis again, that we're going to go back"
"14333740","14336280"," and check the lows of 100 and likely see 40 bucks. "
"14337200","14344120"," But until that happens, it's, it's, it's, it's why it's like, if you have like the walk-in quackin,"
"14344460","14353240"," walking, quacking, talking, looking like a duck, it's got like three of the four to go with 300."
"14354660","14359300"," I mean, there's some work to do, but it's, it's almost a duck."
"14359600","14361820"," It's like, do you see, but not quite K?"
"14362720","14370780"," If it starts to become like a DUC, but not K on the downside, I'll let you know, but it's"
"14370780","14372740"," starting to stink like it's going up there. "
"14376560","14377960"," And I'm a Tesla bull."
"14378880","14392390"," So they're like, don't like, don't think that I don't like Tesla back to"
"14392390","14394630"," a five-minute chart again on Spy."
"14411580","14412800"," That's a big yawn fest. "
"14426360","14428960"," And I'm now on a, both sides of the trade."
"14429140","14432580"," I'm holding both four 12Ps and four 13Cs."
"14433880","14435660"," And now I have a straddle on the market. "
"14444970","14449210"," Yeah, like fup duck, fup duck."
"14449830","14457190"," So I mean, you know, like it's, like, so if you're looking at like the fundamental reason why Tesla"
"14457190","14465970"," should go down, to me, at least there's a fundamental reason for Tesla to go down for"
"14465970","14471990"," technical and data-driven reason for Tesla to go up."
"14472970","14474910"," It says it's going to go the fucking moon. "
"14475830","14495600"," I don't know"
"14495600","14496300"," if it's just Tesla."
"14496620","14497440"," There's a couple out there."
"14497580","14499020"," I thought Meta was doing great today. "
"14500060","14501660"," Netflix was doing great today."
"14501660","14502840"," It was a good question."
"14503400","14504380"," I haven't looked recently. "
"14505040","14509120"," The other thing too is some of these companies have followed NQ."
"14509560","14511900"," They just have an outperformed NQ."
"14512540","14520720"," So my, my, my greater point is, do these tickers carry like they outperform where not, where like"
"14520720","14555390"," Nvidia doesn't, Nvidia, they got"
"14555390","14557590"," stopped out of puts and now I'm just long calls. "
"14574800","14576660"," Starbucks, I didn't like their."
"14577360","14584160"," So when we went into earnings for Starbucks and we went into Starbucks earnings and AMD earnings,"
"14584500","14586180"," AMD had the better chart."
"14588540","14597580"," So my view on both tickers, even though AMD sold off on their earnings was more positive on AMD in"
"14597580","14599420"," the next three months than Starbucks. "
"14603100","14606300"," So when we were, so if you remember the day when we were charting out, remember when we were"
"14606300","14614980"," charting out Starbucks and AMD, I had said everything looks like good to go on AMD going much"
"14614980","14615320"," higher."
"14616160","14620280"," And I had said, and then the only caveat that I had was I haven't checked the short interest."
"14622880","14627440"," And then Starbucks to me was overbought all across the board. "
"14627720","14631000"," Now I know that Starbucks can relentlessly just keep going higher and higher and higher and higher,"
"14631220","14635520"," but I liked the idea of the gains we had on AMD."
"14636080","14642320"," So when it sold off, I went back the day after earnings and I looked at the short interest on"
"14642320","14648220"," AMD and that's when I had made the post on Twitter and said, I expect the next two weeks for"
"14648220","14650500"," it to ramp, like it could take like 10 sessions."
"14651440","14655820"," That was because on March 10th, the short interest was the similar of the same. "
"14656880","14660800"," And I had talked about AMD being a traded stock."
"14662740","14666540"," So in my view, it didn't really fucking matter what the earnings was on AMD."
"14666540","14672720"," They were selling it and they were going to buy it back after earnings, which they did. "
"14674800","14680000"," And the game needs a way more like heavily traded up and down stock than Starbucks."
"14680240","14684540"," Further into this is again, McConnell want that he has no secret plan to solve the US debt and"
"14684540","14684780"," pass."
"14685120","14689400"," So the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell wants that he won't come to President Biden's"
"14689400","14694980"," rescue on the debt limit by breaking a partisan deadlock as a catastrophic US default looms. "
"14695440","14702720"," So a day before a crucial meeting between Biden and congressional leaders, McConnell said in 2020,"
"14702960","14707780"," it was up to him and House Speaker McCarthy to find a solution, even as he projected a confidence"
"14707780","14709680"," that the nation would avert a default."
"14710320","14713460"," Yeah, we have a Tesla invest, not investor day."
"14713560","14714220"," What do we have coming up?"
"14714400","14716580"," We have a tester of Tesla event coming up too, right?"
"14722170","14723050"," Johnny, baby. "
"14732750","14734710"," Yeah, they got the annual annual meeting coming up."
"14736530","14741950"," I'm not a, when I stopped following Tesla news, I traded Tesla much better."
"14741950","14746210"," So I don't, I don't follow it, but I don't keep, I don't drink the Kool-Aid. "
"14748490","14754450"," I try to trade Tesla now on price action and data seems to work better."
"14754770","14757290"," You guys remember, like we bought it, I think I didn't get into it."
"14757610","14762610"," So like when Tesla hit our 100 bucks, I wanted to buy like, I was so anal about it. "
"14762690","14766250"," I was like, I want to buy 96, 75 or 97 and a half or something."
"14767410","14769490"," So I got left behind and I'm like, I ain't chasing that."
"14770190","14773270"," And then I think I finally bought it like 130 bucks or something. "
"14773550","14775030"," I was like, I'm going to be left behind here."
"14775150","14776190"," And I was like, we're going to 220."
"14776190","14777330"," And then I was like, sell 217. "
"14778790","14779890"," And we sold 217."
"14781430","14783810"," So I was very happy with the trade."
"14784050","14785890"," But what we haven't been up above there since then, right?"
"14786050","14789150"," That 220, we hit it and we've, we've just been consolidating ever since. "
"14789430","14789790"," Just grinding."
"14792610","14799270"," So I've been watching it in the background this entire time going, you know, like it doesn't, it's"
"14799270","14804650"," not showing the signs of the heavy role that I was looking for."
"14805890","14808250"," Showing the signs of consolidation for the move higher. "
"14809150","14811350"," I think it's going to, I think it's coming."
"14812990","14817090"," But not only think it's coming and I gave you the levels earlier."
"14817970","14821150"," You start breaking those levels and my positive will be dead. "
"14821150","14826090"," But as long as as long as those rules aren't broken, I stand by that."
"14826090","14829070"," Uh, by that call, does that make sense?"
"14831190","14832890"," I don't know if that makes sense or not."
"14833030","14833390"," So it's a lot. "
"14833590","14836750"," So if this is still happening, the way is still up."
"14836770","14839850"," If this is no longer happening, the way is down."
"14845890","14847650"," Yeah, I read something about Tesla earlier. "
"14847930","14848670"," You're going to read it to you guys."
"14849910","14852150"," I didn't, I didn't regurgitate it or anything."
"14853430","14854070"," All right. "
"14854250","14855610"," I didn't remember it to regurgitate it."
"14855690","14856430"," I'll read it to you right now."
"14856430","14858670"," So we're more clear on what it is. "
"14860570","14870350"," I read about it this morning and then didn't say anything to you guys about it."
"14870690","14871410"," I should have said some."
"14876900","14880840"," Like I used to, I used to be like consume everything Tesla related. "
"14881960","14884440"," And I just, I've been, I've been happier not doing that anymore."
"14887860","14888600"," Happier investor."
"14889720","14893920"," Like I took Tesla from from 130 bucks to 217. "
"14896720","14898180"," Nothing but happiness here."
"14900680","14902740"," Like I'm just happy guy."
"14905120","14907680"," Happy Tesla investor, happy Tesla trader. "
"14923710","14927050"," I could not take another Tesla trade the entire year and I'm happy."
"14931850","14940710"," If I took just that one trade this year, I've probably beat 90% of Tesla traders this year"
"14940710","14943290"," on that one trade."
"14972760","14973120"," I'm going to take a quick break. "
"14973120","14974420"," I can't find that article now in Tesla."
"14974760","14976000"," Maybe somebody can drop it in the chat."
"15002720","15004960"," We got the old dragon foreman over here. "
"15060360","15060920"," It's 141."
"15061460","15062220"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"15062340","15063120"," I'm going to go potty. "
"15063300","15067400"," I'll be back for the next five minutes for 145 for that news drop."
"15082320","15086840"," and I'm reading I'm not going to mention names but some of these politicians I'm reading in the"
"15086840","15095080"," background what they're saying like I expect the politicians to to to rabble rouse I was thinking"
"15095080","15100820"," that over the weekend I was like you know what I expect these politicians to do this shit but when"
"15100820","15112450"," they're using Yellen to do it I'm like it's just gross like using"
"15112450","15122010"," Yellen for that I'm like what the fuck is behind what Jay Pao said versus what Yellen is saying"
"15122010","15131940"," it's a travesty like I'll"
"15131940","15138160"," expect that like if you're a politician you want to I don't know smear shit in the wall if you're"
"15138160","15142880"," like a fed maybe if you're like a fed little fed president or something and you want to say a"
"15142880","15150200"," bunch of shit to cover your ass I know that the treasury secretary does this it's treasury"
"15150200","15158960"," secretaries have done this in the past like they give warnings and shit like I realize that's part"
"15158960","15174680"," of their job but I'm like man I mean just it's just so like such garbage I'll"
"15174680","15180140"," be right back in me like a five minutes gonna take a quick quick quick body break try to get"
