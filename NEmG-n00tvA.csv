"104510","105630"," Nick, good morning, brother."
"106490","107830"," Burr, baby, Burr."
"109250","115070"," I'm trying to contain my excitement at this point this morning, as I'm sure a lot of you are on"
"115070","116370"," Panic's Edge as well. "
"117630","118390"," Good morning, Nick."
"118730","119830"," Good morning, in light, productions."
"120130","120690"," Good morning, Billy. "
"121370","122050"," Good morning, Eric."
"122310","122890"," Good morning, John."
"123990","125990"," I'm in a little bit of a panic mode this morning. "
"127050","130030"," We should get a pretty decent print right off the bell."
"131010","132210"," Good morning, Doug, good morning, Robert."
"132210","132950"," Good morning, Dylan. "
"133850","134910"," Good morning, G Chen."
"138170","141870"," Yeah, this morning's gonna be wild, right?"
"147800","150120"," We got a few minutes here to welcome everybody in this morning."
"150120","151540"," Good morning, Kay Goose again. "
"152120","152920"," Good morning, Jill."
"153460","154100"," Good to see you."
"156920","158580"," This one was wild mornings, right?"
"159420","160280"," Without a doubt. "
"162860","164820"," Yes, sir, Chaz, good morning."
"166840","171120"," So, this is going to be a giant print, I think."
"172840","176600"," I want to say, yeah, there's a few things I got to stay here before you get started this morning,"
"176600","177400"," everybody out there. "
"177540","179360"," First off, good morning, if you're just joining us."
"185380","189400"," There, so there should be some continuation in this."
"190980","195140"," There should be some continuation, I would think, to 4750. "
"196940","201140"," Now, that doesn't mean we don't trade down off the bell and then move to 4750."
"202460","203860"," Sell for profit."
"204860","207300"," Some people will attempt to take profit right off the bell this morning. "
"207860","215840"," So be aware of that, but you do, you will have an added premium spike right off the bell as"
"215840","216000"," well."
"216500","218720"," This is when the FOMO typically kicks in."
"219420","226280"," You'll have a two to three day move and sometimes they're only two days, sometimes they're three"
"226280","230820"," days, but even within that move, right off the bell, we could sell down briefly to allow more"
"230820","231620"," people to get in. "
"233180","235320"," We could just green bar it straight up to the top."
"235620","238320"," What that does is leaves a lot of bulls behind."
"239400","247480"," And then they wind up buying a top, but this isn't the top though, but we should tag 4750 today. "
"248060","254180"," And we might come back and find support that roughly, what do I have it at?"
"254380","256519"," I think it's 4650."
"257459","263020"," Let me take a look at the chart here in a moment, but I do want you to realize that"
"263020","265360"," there are two moves that can be made today, right?"
"267820","273860"," We wind up, we swing high, tag out, because you're going to get FOMO always getting in one way or"
"273860","274060"," another."
"274260","277440"," So one way, so let's say, let's have the bell week, we red bar it down. "
"278120","278820"," I wouldn't take that."
"278840","280000"," I don't know if I would take the loss."
"280200","283980"," I'm going to try to sell the bell if I can, if I get a red bar right off the"
"283980","286020"," bell and the premium doesn't kick in. "
"286520","288800"," One thing I want all of you guys to realize out there, you got to get this stuff out here"
"288800","289160"," real quick."
"290560","295200"," When we come off the bell, the price of your options won't kick in immediately."
"295900","298420"," It can sometimes take a few minutes, sometimes five minutes. "
"299740","302340"," The market makers will attempt to get you out of your calls."
"303060","308540"," Now, if we red bar it down and you panic, we will probably head right back up at some point,"
"308720","308740"," right?"
"308900","310860"," The dip will be bought and we'll ride it up."
"311140","314260"," But if we green bar it straight up, we should go to 4750. "
"314420","316180"," That's the implied move."
"316440","318040"," Okay, that's what we think it's going to happen."
"318040","322880"," That's what most of the market thinks will happen, either off the bell or at some point today. "
"325360","327880"," Now, we expect to see some support it."
"328300","333340"," I'm going to say that support, I think SG put out 4650."
"334180","340220"," I think it's more closer to, I would start to look at 46692, but we'll look at the live stroke. "
"340220","342300"," We'll look at the live book map today right off the bell."
"342500","344620"," We'll know where support is off the bell."
"344960","347160"," We'll know if the buyers are kicking in right at the bell. "
"350080","354980"," The thought is that we go to 4750 or around there."
"355680","358980"," But as we start, you're going to see short covering."
"359800","360820"," That's, you have to know that. "
"361500","365660"," And there are certain short covering triggers straight to all-time highs at some point."
"366080","368960"," We looked at those yesterday, be aware of those."
"368960","376680"," So if you missed yesterday's trading into the bell yesterday and you want to grab along at some"
"376680","379080"," point, you might have a chance today. "
"379460","381380"," We might trade down to 4650."
"381380","382400"," It wouldn't shock me, right?"
"382660","383300"," That happens sometimes."
"384180","386200"," So just be honest, I'll just be aware of that. "
"387820","393260"," If let's say you take your calls at the bell, take your money and run, and you hope that we"
"393260","395780"," trade back to grab one more for another rip."
"396420","399520"," Now, this van at trade will end at some point."
"400340","401760"," It's not going to last forever. "
"402320","407180"," You want to make sure that you're taking profit before we begin the trade sideways."
"407960","413920"," We also probably will trade down next week into Thursday morning at some point."
"414160","416300"," So this trade will wrap up. "
"416860","420840"," You know that like on Friday, once they'll kill these options at some point between now and Friday,"
"422360","428320"," you'll be buying FOMO at some point either today or if we go down right away at this morning,"
"429160","431300"," there's a good chance that you can catch a good rip."
"431560","435980"," But if we green barge straight up around the bell and you try to grab that top, you're probably"
"435980","440940"," going to get caught into a thank you for playing type situation just like the Bears did the other"
"440940","441120"," day."
"442540","445560"," So just be conscious of that as we trade this day today ahead of you. "
"446020","448840"," There's no reason why we can't just take profit off the bell."
"449020","450160"," Now, I wouldn't take it right the bell."
"450620","452000"," You got to let the money kick in. "
"452040","456340"," It takes a few minutes usually for the legit price to kick in for those calls."
"456340","458240"," You want the buyers to show up."
"461830","462690"," Congratulations, Alex. "
"463650","466050"," Good morning to any of you that are just joining us."
"466050","466630"," Good morning."
"467050","467770"," Where we roam?"
"468030","468730"," Good morning, Alex. "
"469790","470230"," Constantinos."
"470230","471070"," Good morning, John."
"471270","471670"," Good morning. "
"472330","473030"," Hot, hot, hot."
"473110","473490"," Good morning."
"473630","473910"," Our ass. "
"473970","474350"," Good morning."
"475110","475310"," Ryan."
"475490","475890"," Good morning. "
"480040","480640"," Good morning."
"480640","481000"," Good morning."
"481000","481140"," Good morning. "
"481280","481720"," Good morning."
"481720","481800"," Good morning."
"481800","482620"," Good morning. "
"485200","485560"," Eric."
"485560","486480"," Good morning, Billy."
"487060","488200"," Good morning in light production. "
"488620","489280"," Good morning, Nick."
"489480","491880"," If I have missed you at all, I don't think I've missed any of you out there."
"491960","492080"," Okay. "
"492140","492680"," So good morning."
"494930","498750"," Just so you know, you're going to see, you know, you'll see some weird stuff as the bell opens this"
"498750","499030"," morning."
"499750","505070"," And sometimes what happens is if we red bar it down, you won't get the premium on your on your"
"505070","505530"," on your FDS. "
"506150","509130"," And then it'll bounce back and all of a sudden, your FDS are worth more money."
"509270","513030"," So you can even add to that pile if we take out if we take a red bar off the"
"513030","518350"," bell that the target today, if you're if you're anybody out there, the target today, everyone's"
"518350","521429"," looking for is 4750."
"522289","523750"," Without a doubt, we're above. "
"524410","528570"," We remember we talked yesterday about futures will sometimes put us above, right?"
"529190","532670"," The place is above for the event that's going to take place this morning."
"533170","534430"," We're going to make the look above."
"534730","534930"," We did. "
"536190","537390"," CPI numbers were acceptable."
"538470","539910"," The nod came out from the banks."
"540430","541130"," Yada, yada, yada. "
"541430","542530"," I don't think we go to 500."
"543390","547810"," I saw I'm not going to mention who, but they said all time high as this morning."
"548270","549230"," We talked about that yesterday. "
"550190","551370"," Do I think we go to all time highs?"
"551610","556110"," No, not unless we see way more call structure at the 500 mark."
"556510","559310"," If we don't see 500 calls, we're not going to 478, 479."
"559850","560410"," We're not going to 480. "
"560950","566170"," You have to see the call structure farther out, like 10 points away from where we're actually"
"566170","566550"," going."
"567090","567690"," Does that make sense?"
"568170","570750"," If you see 450 puts, you might see 460."
"571530","574190"," If you see 440 puts, you might see 450. "
"575270","576570"," Same thing goes on the call side."
"577330","578170"," There's a call wall."
"578590","579830"," There's an absolute gamma strike. "
"579990","581790"," It's called actually above the call wall."
"582630","585070"," If you don't have anything out there, we're not going there."
"585970","586630"," Good morning. "
"586730","589990"," F one for our f fisted morning hit, Mikey."
"590010","590850"," Good morning, blood start."
"591030","591570"," Good morning, Lucas. "
"591570","592310"," Good morning, Philip."
"592710","593290"," Weeky face."
"593330","593970"," What up, brother?"
"594470","594910"," Frederick. "
"595270","595810"," How are you?"
"596430","596870"," Travis?"
"597070","597430"," How are you?"
"597630","598350"," P.E. Mahash."
"598650","600810"," G.P. John Saperito."
"602050","602490"," Steven. "
"602950","602990"," X."
"603590","603590"," Kirk."
"604770","604770"," Alex."
"605170","605630"," Where we roam. "
"606050","607270"," Good morning to everybody out there."
"607310","609430"," If you're listening, right now is 105 you on here right now."
"609950","611630"," We have the bell coming up in the next 13 minutes. "
"611630","614450"," You guys know exactly what we did in the closed yesterday, right?"
"615090","616430"," You guys know exactly what we did."
"616550","619490"," We traded it three times yesterday for prints all day long."
"620510","622110"," And this is the big boy print, right?"
"622430","624210"," This is the big boy print into today. "
"625230","626810"," And we were trading this actually."
"627050","627590"," It's kind of funny."
"627710","633230"," I yesterday sees the CNBC was claiming something about Monday being a red day. "
"633630","636190"," And I'm like, shit, man, we were green on Monday."
"636850","639810"," I guess we're trading a different market than a lot of traders out there."
"640910","644110"," So we had bears making money off the bell on Monday. "
"644490","647610"," We had bulls making money on the bell on the clothes yesterday or Monday."
"648330","652750"," And then yesterday you had bears making money off the bell, and you had bulls making money on the"
"652750","653230"," way back up."
"653330","656010"," So it's been a pretty good run all the way around, right?"
"656850","658290"," We're all making money around here. "
"658950","662270"," We're definitely trading something different than the rest of the market talks about."
"663230","664630"," And that's what makes us traders."
"664930","666630"," And this makes you a good investor as well. "
"666990","671650"," If you're a stock buyer, being a trader helps you be a better stock buyer, a better investor."
"675630","676910"," Good morning to all of you this morning."
"678790","680830"," I'm trying to contain my excitement at this point. "
"681230","683730"," Some of you all about, there's got to be a panic and like myself, right?"
"684590","685070"," Got to be."
"686510","687390"," Good morning, Jeremy."
"687710","689590"," Good morning, Joe, Joe, Joe Nam. "
"690390","691450"," Is it a Joe Nam?"
"692130","692910"," Good morning, Belgium."
"693130","693690"," Good morning, Charlie."
"693830","694430"," Good morning, we're attached. "
"694430","695210"," Good morning, Joe."
"695990","696870"," What up, Joe?"
"697390","698050"," How you doing, brother?"
"700250","701810"," How's that money printer this morning?"
"702470","703150"," Good morning, Ricardo."
"703490","704210"," Good morning, Emerson. "
"704350","704970"," Good morning, Dejan."
"705710","706790"," Good morning, Mateus."
"707530","708130"," Good morning, we're attached. "
"708370","708730"," Good morning, go."
"708830","712050"," We're said to be grown and Vescua, my brother."
"712930","713970"," Good morning. "
"722520","723060"," Excuse me."
"723060","724860"," I got a sore throat because I've been talking so much."
"725240","726680"," Good morning, WS7Z. "
"727040","728220"," Good morning, Jasmine."
"728740","730280"," Good morning, Alexa."
"730520","731260"," Good morning, Tom. "
"733780","734540"," Morning, Zach."
"737180","738880"," Don't worry, you guys can get better at trading."
"739060","741940"," If you guys aren't that good at trading, we talked about a yesterday. "
"742640","744240"," I want you to start paper trading this stuff."
"745020","747060"," Joe, donut yesterday said grab a Weebull account."
"747300","748420"," They'll they have paper trading. "
"748880","755060"," He said, I told you yesterday, I think I maybe I didn't, but I think the thinkorswim has paper"
"755060","757640"," trading and just paper trade this stuff."
"758080","762400"," Listen in every day, see where the trades are, put some money on."
"762680","764480"," You know, I wouldn't put your whole account on. "
"764560","770000"," I would say, you know, start with 1 to 5% and make trades and see over the course of"
"770000","770560"," 10 trades."
"771040","771980"," Are you making money or not?"
"772340","773380"," Go back, Reddit journal."
"773760","774760"," Did I time this right?"
"774960","778220"," Did I time my longs, my shorts?"
"779220","781240"," Am I catching what I need to catch in this broadcast?"
"782140","784080"," Am I setting my support and resistance lines?"
"785080","785840"," Not all that kind of stuff. "
"789550","791090"," Yeah, where's Chase here this morning?"
"793030","794270"," Good morning, Quantum League."
"794790","795590"," Good morning, Julian."
"795850","796730"," Good morning, Mellow Yellow. "
"796730","796910"," Hello."
"802000","805740"," This Captain Jim James with WSBR Pirate Radio."
"808280","809440"," Good morning, Thomas. "
"809820","810700"," Good morning, Willy Smoke."
"811180","814480"," Good morning, Billy Hotch P.E.T. Croat because we've had it on demand."
"814800","814840"," Yep. "
"816950","817910"," Good morning, Starlight."
"818250","819910"," Yeah, just paper trade it for a week."
"820430","828340"," So you guys can see where we're tagging and making this money and go cut. "
"828500","830680"," You can also call them and get a version of book map."
"831140","832980"," Yeah, book map is cheap through them."
"833120","834800"," It's a little bit, it's a book map light. "
"835320","839820"," I think they only do the major indexes, but if you're trading the major indexes with book map, that"
"839820","840040"," works."
"841020","841760"," Good morning, Nave."
"842000","846520"," You had a problem this morning as well putting on the spoofing. "
"847300","850320"," The spoofing add on, I think only works for futures."
"851500","857540"," So I have a, I sent an email this morning to support, and I haven't heard back the live chat"
"857540","859360"," wasn't up and running this morning for me."
"861720","863860"," So just, just so you guys see, right?"
"864640","867960"," We'll have two possible moves here in the next, next nine minutes, okay?"
"868600","870120"," Yeah, head on a swivel this morning. "
"870620","871740"," There's two options, right?"
"872200","875900"," We could red bar it straight down to support at around 465."
"878900","880540"," We can call it like 466."
"880980","884800"," We'll know when we look on the live stream this morning on the book map. "
"884940","886060"," We'll know where the support is."
"887680","894000"," If the premium, the premium and the interest doesn't kick in on your calls immediately at the bell,"
"894360","900440"," sometimes bulls will sell out of their position immediately, will bounce, rip higher, and you would"
"900440","903220"," have lost out on those calls, you know, either way."
"905020","910240"," You can see right now some already, you can see some support kicking in just off the bell here. "
"910860","917140"," There's a little bit of resistance kicking above, some resistance above at 7188, 471, 88, and"
"917140","918240"," there's a, there's some support."
"918640","919860"," You can see it right up here."
"920340","925860"," So I'm claiming we're going to 475, and right now there's some resistance at 472, 37. "
"926360","927480"," So be conscious of that."
"927900","931820"," This resistance can disappear once the bell rings this morning."
"931820","933920"," So don't take this as in stone. "
"935400","939760"," And what I'm starting to say to you is if we green, we might green bar it straight up."
"939900","943300"," If we are going to see the money kicking in your calls, if we don't green bar it straight up,"
"944160","948520"," you can take your profit and reenter the first dip and write it twice, right?"
"948640","951620"," You take the money and run, then you buy the dip and you write it up."
"951960","957420"," If we green bar it straight off the bell, I would look for where is the resistance going to be"
"957420","957840"," up here. "
"958240","964500"," Sometimes we'll, we'll, we'll slam down red bars, slam up red bars as well, but then sell off or go"
"964500","970660"," higher, and you could wait that first for two to five minutes or whatever to sell those calls and"
"970660","971420"," get some money."
"972900","982620"," Ben Godfrey, Ben Godfrey, VIP subscriber, VIP"
"982620","985920"," VIP brother, RC Benjamin."
"987000","988880"," Thank you very much for your tip this morning. "
"989360","990700"," Ritesh, thank you for your tip."
"991840","992940"," Thank you, Melon."
"994040","996580"," I hope you guys make money this morning. "
"998800","1000040"," Well, we're making money this morning."
"1000140","1000900"," I can tell you that for shit."
"1000900","1001160"," Sure. "
"1001360","1001940"," We're making money."
"1003940","1006060"," We got six more minutes until the bell."
"1007220","1008200"," Good morning, Chase. "
"1008400","1008820"," How are you brother?"
"1010780","1011260"," Yeah."
"1011420","1014100"," So 4745 is claiming to be resistance."
"1014520","1019480"," I want you guys to see though that just off pre-market just until we open the bell right here. "
"1020200","1022280"," You can see right here, right?"
"1023300","1023780"," 47487."
"1024980","1030200"," But even off the bell, it wouldn't shock me to see, you know what you'll see is that you'll see"
"1030200","1034720"," if somebody's short and the move went the wrong way for a bank."
"1035319","1038520"," And so what they'll do is they'll dump it right off the bell, right?"
"1038740","1047440"," They'll sell their own underlying shares in the spy and across SPXES they'll just sell, right?"
"1048100","1050220"," Creates a quick shoot shot down. "
"1050780","1054940"," They get out of their shorts and then they rebuy their shares cheap."
"1054940","1060060"," It's this algo driven computer software driven way to not lose in this market."
"1060200","1062020"," It's how banks don't lose generally speaking. "
"1062740","1066940"," So be conscious of that right off the bell this morning that that can happen."
"1067500","1069880"," Oftentimes though, this happened to me a million times."
"1069880","1073420"," I'm so panicky that I'll sell my calls at the bell. "
"1073840","1077520"," We'll shoot down and shoot straight north and I didn't collect all my money."
"1084800","1087840"," I'm already in 470s and 472s."
"1088680","1091260"," So we're going to print heavy and hard. "
"1093910","1094930"," You know, it's really weird."
"1095130","1101190"," There's a calculator for this website called options profit calculator, but it doesn't always work."
"1101690","1108510"," Or I'll explain it more later after the bell, but it doesn't always calculate the IV properly. "
"1108910","1112510"," It doesn't calculate volume behind those calls."
"1113350","1115330"," If volume drops off, you'll sometimes miss it."
"1116310","1122530"," And then also, depending on if the market makers think we're actually going to that price in the"
"1122530","1125870"," time period left, they'll sometimes screw you on those as well. "
"1126090","1128750"," So it's a baseline thought, but it's not always accurate."
"1133270","1135030"," My life is going to kick me out."
"1136150","1140190"," So we got four minutes off. "
"1140190","1141170"," I want to talk to you guys real quick."
"1142150","1147430"," So if you are not in any trades right now and you're looking to get into a trade, you're going"
"1147430","1149930"," to be hoping for a dip buy today."
"1151270","1153250"," You're going to hope to grab something down around. "
"1154770","1157490"," We would hope for at least, let me take a look here and see."
"1160930","1165770"," You're going to hope for a dip buy down at 46963."
"1166290","1167290"," We'll know off the bell. "
"1167790","1170290"," But if you can get a dip buy today, of course, you want to get a dip buy."
"1170850","1171770"," This market's going up."
"1172170","1174410"," Do I think it's going up to 478, 480?"
"1174650","1175610"," No, probably 475. "
"1176370","1176910"," Oh, yeah, 475."
"1177930","1180710"," So if you can get a chance to get in on that run, do it early."
"1181190","1187230"," Do not wait to grab 475s for the end of the week because they'll burn all those calls. "
"1188110","1190950"," And if they're going to print all time highs, they're probably not going to print them until the"
"1190950","1191730"," 17th."
"1192370","1194630"," Probably print them like opening of the 17th."
"1194870","1196710"," They burn all the calls for the rest of this week. "
"1197110","1198750"," They burn all the puts for the rest of this week."
"1199450","1200350"," It's thank you for playing."
"1201530","1202590"," We trade all time highs. "
"1202590","1204490"," Let's say are close to it on the on Monday."
"1204750","1209470"," And they sell this thing down into Thursday while you're sitting in calls and Monday is a bull."
"1209930","1215810"," And then they rip it back up on Thursday and then make it go sideways for the spreads that the"
"1215810","1217110"," banks have on Friday opex. "
"1217470","1218370"," Again, it'll get wild."
"1218790","1219730"," It should get wild."
"1220270","1223690"," I'm not guaranteeing this, but this happens quite frequently in opex weeks. "
"1224690","1226430"," It wouldn't shock me if that happened."
"1228860","1229820"," So you got to be fast."
"1229840","1230160"," Okay. "
"1230960","1231970"," Yeah, I can show you Tesla."
"1232750","1235370"," I'll load it up right now before the bell for you."
"1235770","1238090"," And then the moment that it opens, we'll take a look at it. "
"1238130","1238290"," Okay."
"1245810","1248970"," We have more buyers than sellers before the opening bell right now."
"1249030","1250230"," We got two minutes left. "
"1250670","1252270"," I got to open up my my stuff."
"1252470","1252710"," Hold on."
"1278600","1279040"," Yeah. "
"1279100","1285860"," So on the clothes on on yesterday calls were a dollar 50 each and 68 cents each."
"1285860","1292320"," So dollar 50 on the four seventies 68 cents on the went once the club bring the bell for 15."
"1292520","1293240"," That's what they dropped to. "
"1293540","1297460"," They were much higher, but I think they're playing a dollar 60 or something like that at one point."
"1297960","1301800"," Then they were 69 cents at the close yesterday."
"1301840","1303360"," So we're going to see what happens right now. "
"1304020","1307040"," We're going to stand the spy right now because I know a lot of us are playing the spy."
"1307540","1313000"," So I got you guys in that we'll check on Tesla just after the bell once things come down."
"1316050","1323160"," I'll give you guys a quick look if you guys want to see Tesla real quick. "
"1328130","1330090"," 1079 your targets 1090."
"1336350","1340010"," Good morning, everybody."
"1340430","1341270"," We're going to make some money here. "
"1355090","1356610"," Thank you, Belgian, for the tip."
"1361140","1362100"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"1362980","1366220"," 255 on the one on the four seventies. "
"1366220","1369960"," 253 118 on the four seventy twos."
"1370020","1371340"," That's a 400 percent print right there."
"1393190","1396490"," We have buyers stepping in on four seventy three C."
"1397390","1399310"," That's 70 cents just a heads up. "
"1399810","1402610"," Lots of interest at four seventy three C."
"1403450","1404430"," They're at 70 cents."
"1404430","1405390"," I might give it a little bit."
"1405730","1407850"," Now they're moving over to four seventy two C."
"1410170","1413350"," And there's a lot of buyers right now as well on four seventy C."
"1424760","1426700"," And we're ripping right off the bell here. "
"1437790","1440770"," You've got no resistance above just the heads up."
"1440870","1442810"," There's no resistance at four seventy three."
"1443130","1444510"," That's all minor resistance. "
"1445450","1450690"," You have a little bit of yet some major resistance before the bell at four seventy two fifty two."
"1451150","1459070"," Your next resistance is four seventy three oh seven then four seventy three fifty four price target"
"1459070","1479430"," today is four seventy five zero four seventy four nine four four"
"1479430","1481490"," seventy C is now up to three dollars."
"1482450","1487170"," Woo dollar sixty five on four seventy twos. "
"1487590","1488990"," Holy shit."
"1489550","1492630"," Four bucks on four oh yeah."
"1494480","1497050"," Dollar seventy three and four seventy twos. "
"1497870","1499330"," All right I'm selling."
"1511110","1512090"," Jesus."
"1520460","1522760"," That's a lot of money. "
"1536650","1537810"," Hey Belgian 24."
"1538410","1539170"," Thanks for the tip."
"1539710","1541590"," You're heading offshore for two weeks tomorrow. "
"1541810","1543430"," We'll probably won't be able to trade a lot."
"1543790","1545670"," Hey brother I hope you made some money this week."
"1546870","1548830"," Thanks for supporting the channel. "
"1549030","1550970"," Make sure you check back in when you get back brother."
"1554170","1555550"," How long are you going to be away for?"
"1555870","1559990"," When you're saying heading offshore are you fishing or are you lobster and what are you doing?"
"1566960","1567340"," Yeah."
"1570220","1573640"," Okay all right so I'm out of my position now I can I can read what you guys are saying. "
"1575240","1578740"," So I'm I took profit if anybody I don't know what you guys are doing out there."
"1583730","1585770"," I took profit right right at that pin."
"1587190","1587990"," Holy shit. "
"1590490","1591990"," I'm in panic mode right now."
"1598130","1601030"," Yep so I'm going to put Tesla on for you right now let's start with Tesla."
"1610150","1611450"," I'm in full panic mode. "
"1612150","1613210"," I don't know what you guys."
"1615810","1616930"," Maybe it's just me."
"1619670","1625230"," It does look like ping pong this morning on Tesla by the dipper's down below 10. "
"1625430","1626930"," It's nice to see this right here."
"1627410","1629370"," You got real nice support forming in Tesla."
"1629510","1635130"," Remember we had blue sky down here at 10.50. It looks like you've got my good FOMO buyers stepping"
"1635130","1635410"," in. "
"1635830","1640990"," There are more sellers than buyers right now but the hero indicator is very positive at this point."
"1641710","1645290"," There's the support that you're growing down here is very good to see."
"1645730","1652750"," Now one thing to think about today would be remember we've got the sellers above here right. "
"1653250","1657570"," You got a swarm of sellers at 10.89 10.93. 1,100."
"1657790","1662930"," If you're able to break through this at some point there could be a major squeeze above 1,100."
"1663330","1665190"," Now this is your trading zone right now. "
"1665490","1672070"," You are compressing in here and that usually does lead to a squeeze much higher or it ends up"
"1672070","1674770"," leading to a sell off."
"1675110","1679950"," So just be aware of that as you trade Tesla that the trading range is compressing."
"1680510","1683830"," You're watching a squeeze of buyers and sellers right now. "
"1693930","1695310"," So Tesla's on."
"1698570","1703470"," I got the time stretched out now on book map."
"1704170","1705170"," You guys want to buy the second. "
"1708090","1709150"," Maybe that helps out."
"1713010","1716090"," I got you guys."
"1721840","1723060"," Yeah, hot, hot. "
"1723060","1725840"," But Dell do Diz next."
"1726440","1727860"," So you guys got all that on Tesla."
"1728320","1729340"," You can pause the program. "
"1730240","1732720"," Go back and read or watch right."
"1732840","1737680"," I had to say about Tesla and we'll check back in on Tesla today as well."
"1738240","1740220"," You know that Tesla is compressing right. "
"1740460","1741060"," Be aware of that."
"1741660","1743220"," That there is a lot of support here."
"1743640","1749440"," You do have sellers hiding above at 10.88.45. You've got more supply of sellers again at that same"
"1749440","1749740"," spot. "
"1750160","1754200"," 10.98. Though it looks like we're compressing in Tesla."
"1754460","1759480"," We could have a major squeeze so that people can take some profit into Friday."
"1759480","1764140"," I do want you to be aware that Tesla tends to run before you are. "
"1764300","1769380"," You might already know that or if it does run into your and doesn't sell off, it'll sometimes after"
"1769380","1772160"," it makes the run sell off into actually are."
"1772460","1777920"," Maybe go back and watch some of you guys probably know that but if sometimes if Tesla sells"
"1777920","1780780"," straight off into your it'll rip after you are right."
"1781140","1785320"," If the run is before you are the closer that we get to you are there's going to be a"
"1785320","1786180"," tendency to sell down. "
"1786340","1792440"," So it doesn't make doesn't surprise me that we could try to force a rip much higher and even"
"1792440","1793800"," squeeze Tesla at some point."
"1798730","1800050"," I'm in panic mode right now."
"1802390","1803550"," That was a crazy open. "
"1804190","1805830"," I don't know what you guys out there."
"1806350","1807990"," I don't need to trade for the rest of the week."
"1812610","1814990"," And spies bouncing on that earlier support. "
"1816350","1820730"," So we're going to look at a we're looking to see if you've got real support here or if we're"
"1820730","1821570"," going to catch that bounce."
"1823110","1826550"," I did type in Disney so we'll try to get to that here in just a moment."
"1827570","1830470"," We'll see if this is a dip buy for for spy. "
"1843380","1844860"," So let's take a look here."
"1845000","1845140"," Okay."
"1846980","1849880"," Let's see where the dip buy is on the spy. "
"1851900","1856260"," Looks like it's right here and we had looks to me like the buyers are stepping right in here."
"1857780","1860520"," There are a lot of sellers here just to be aware of."
"1860920","1866180"," There are a lot of sellers here on the spy but you do have a positive here indicator. "
"1867240","1871360"," You have 54 you've got a lot more buyers than sellers at this point."
"1871360","1875760"," I would recommend to you they rely upon some form of traditional charting."
"1876620","1879880"," You know if you guys I'm going to reenter a trade with with spy with you today. "
"1879880","1880180"," I will."
"1880800","1888000"," So what I would think would be that we're going to trade back to at least 46874 possible that we"
"1888000","1889820"," trade back to 46692."
"1890880","1891360"," Okay. "
"1891760","1894300"," So that these these banks are going to want a good entry."
"1895620","1896360"," So we'll see."
"1896680","1897800"," We'll see if we trade down. "
"1897920","1898680"," I might miss that trade."
"1899140","1899560"," You could take."
"1899820","1905380"," I'm not going to do this but you could place an order right now for some FTS and then add"
"1905380","1909040"," to that order if we trade way back down to 470. "
"1910560","1911420"," 46998 or so."
"1912480","1914740"," You can always dollar cost average in."
"1915340","1916920"," Your target for today is 475. "
"1918440","1920100"," That is the target for today."
"1921180","1922220"," Let's take a look and see if it's still there."
"1925120","1925980"," Maybe it isn't. "
"1926100","1926420"," Look at that."
"1927080","1928460"," So it has changed slightly."
"1929520","1938240"," The price target right now unless something changes the next price target is only 472.98 and 473 "
"1938240","1947540",".47. So scratch 475 unless we break through the support of our this resistance above be conscious of"
"1947540","1947680"," this. "
"1947700","1948020"," Okay."
"1948700","1949940"," As you take this trade."
"1950720","1952980"," There could be some sneaky peak going on in here. "
"1953280","1956140"," There were sellers at 475 and they swooped right down here."
"1961080","1963300"," Let's take a look at Diz."
"1970880","1973180"," Let's see what we can see about Diz. "
"1974840","1980420"," If you have more sellers than buyers on Diz right now you know how Disney goes right."
"1987860","1990340"," I used to try it is often not traded with options."
"1991420","1992980"," It's traded with actual stock. "
"1996100","1998400"," It's one of the market hedges for the United States."
"1998920","2002580"," So a boiler was tend to trade it with physical stock."
"2003740","2006160"," So they're taking profit right here right at the bell. "
"2006780","2010420"," This is a usual this is common practice for trading."
"2012540","2019740"," It reminds me Disney reminds me a lot of the underlying spider components like XLF does shit like"
"2019740","2019940"," this."
"2021040","2024920"," You kind of have to wait for that major dip and then buy that dip. "
"2025400","2029160"," If you're looking for a dip we're going to we're going to chart it classically right now right"
"2029160","2030140"," traditionally."
"2031420","2036680"," And we're looking for two levels for a dip right we're looking at for 157 and 156."
"2037820","2040900"," So let's see if we see any actual support there. "
"2042080","2044240"," See if we see any support down here."
"2044580","2052380"," There's a little bit of ice down here 156.97 but the real money is down at 156.15 155"
"2052380","2055820"," right you think it's done going down."
"2057239","2067219"," It's probably probably not done going down until 156.08 maybe 155.11. Be"
"2067219","2073280"," careful of this and then you want to be seeing where the price target is for the ultimate price"
"2073280","2077820"," target is for for Disney and I like Disney by the way. "
"2078800","2079300"," It's 180."
"2081710","2087770"," There's lots of resistance at 151.60 but that's where the price target is."
"2087969","2092790"," That'd be a nice ER run too wouldn't it 180 like a run up to 180 would be pretty pretty"
"2092790","2093409"," bad ass. "
"2094090","2101190"," I do want you to also see that if you do break through this resistance here at 161.15 that"
"2101190","2102710"," you could take this next leg up."
"2102710","2105890"," So there's two ways to deal with this right."
"2106510","2113850"," You wait until you get over 161.15 or you wait for a dip by 150 or 156 or so. "
"2115210","2123790"," Maybe you start to enter 156 and average more in at 150 with a price target of 163 or even"
"2123790","2130910"," 180 in a call spread or you wait until we break above 161 and then you ride it up 180"
"2130910","2131890"," with a price target of 180."
"2148270","2149210"," Let's take a look."
"2153900","2155860"," Yeah I did reset my computer last. "
"2156040","2157060"," Oh this just heads up."
"2157800","2161960"," I reset my computer this morning and I reset my internet this morning."
"2163680","2166900"," So yeah I'll check good for you. "
"2166980","2169240"," I saw that good news coming out on fun hood this morning."
"2169980","2175440"," Real good news coming out coming out this morning on Chase made a quick 900 bucks."
"2175680","2176260"," Hell yeah brother. "
"2178670","2180370"," Check check diz for you."
"2180890","2183530"," Hood had some great yeah brother."
"2183850","2186250"," FDs are printing fat this morning. "
"2187150","2188310"," Super fat."
"2189630","2194630"," And I know a couple of you guys out there have been long since Monday bottom."
"2195210","2199250"," Some of you diamond handed straight through all three days. "
"2199650","2200710"," Straight gangsters."
"2201890","2203710"," No fear from some of you out there."
"2208070","2209850"," I need you to write a damn NATO story. "
"2214430","2215530"," Robert Botvix points."
"2218810","2220410"," So Falcon's on an oil rig."
"2220890","2223250"," How long is your cycle on the rig?"
"2223450","2225030"," Is it three months?"
"2225350","2225850"," Is it two weeks?"
"2226110","2226410"," Three weeks?"
"2227410","2229410"," I had a buddy that was on an oil rig down in Texas. "
"2229990","2230730"," He made a lot of money."
"2231150","2232150"," But he was a diver."
"2232850","2234270"," He made a lot of money as a diver. "
"2234470","2235430"," But dude he got divorced."
"2235910","2237050"," He had no life."
"2237230","2237610"," No family. "
"2241770","2242430"," Hell yeah."
"2244210","2245250"," Good morning Jean."
"2245390","2246850"," I'm so glad you made money this morning. "
"2254930","2256170"," Yes sir Alex."
"2256390","2257430"," Let the rest."
"2257630","2258230"," And that's the thing. "
"2258330","2260450"," You're already in low enough that you can let them ride."
"2263030","2266390"," RTY is getting a decent rejection off the MAs and EMA's."
"2266470","2269770"," We'll take a look at Hood right now and then we'll take a look at IWM. "
"2272490","2277870"," Yeah I wonder if they're if they're pinning Russell because of the squeeze that'll take place."
"2278450","2280310"," It'll split Jesus 1679."
"2281650","2283770"," I guess that was a good buy in Hood yesterday. "
"2285110","2286670"," They had some great news today right."
"2287170","2288850"," Something about working from home still."
"2290870","2292430"," A little positive bump. "
"2296650","2306170"," I do want you to notice though that the the support came up from 1362 to 1388"
"2306170","2310910"," and you now have some major support at 1520 on Hood."
"2311770","2313850"," That's a very bullish development for Hood."
"2315690","2321410"," I do want you to see that if you break above 1890 you can see some serious squeezing on Hood. "
"2322190","2323770"," Like serious squeezing."
"2325730","2328090"," Might want to pay attention to Hood today folks."
"2328870","2336150"," You have more sellers than buyers right now in Hood but it is primed for you guys are seeing that"
"2336150","2337170"," happening all over. "
"2337930","2339930"," You guys are seeing that happening all over."
"2340070","2343930"," You know what would be neat would be to get a call spread that's way outside the money."
"2344770","2347530"," I like expires maybe right at ER. "
"2350350","2357810"," That would be interesting because if they if they waited to pull the the if they like the panic"
"2359710","2366930"," shorts off then Hood would go to some stupid number for a brief moment in Prince spreads."
"2368910","2370210"," So there's Hood for you."
"2370490","2374790"," Hood's looking very positive right now just so you know even though there's sellers right here. "
"2375710","2379630"," The structure of Hood has improved overall."
"2389220","2391540"," I'm gonna go right back to spy right now for you."
"2391800","2393360"," Let me let IWM load. "
"2396900","2398760"," I'll check Tesla again in a bit."
"2405490","2409750"," Henry's saying that spy puts that."
"2413030","2416270"," Oh, we keep saying FCX is up almost two bucks today. "
"2417170","2420070"," I love trading FCX to be honest with you."
"2421010","2424330"," There is some dip buying going on on Disney."
"2426190","2428590"," I get sucked in FCX all the time. "
"2428990","2430570"," I love trading FCX."
"2431090","2435790"," I think we talked about a dip buy down below between 40, 97 and 40 bucks right."
"2436370","2437690"," I've got it charted on here. "
"2438250","2443550"," I'm seeing it right in front of me where I said by the dip between 40.97 and 40 bucks."
"2444670","2449670"," It dipped all the way down to 40.28 and just printed up to 45 bucks."
"2449850","2451430"," Good shout out, Winky. "
"2457010","2458730"," I'll do the Q's next for Tesh."
"2461110","2463370"," Yeah, yeah, FCX has been very nice."
"2466640","2468620"," I'll check Roblox for you as well. "
"2474390","2478510"," All right, Zach, I'll talk to you here in just a 14 days offshore, 28 days home."
"2478930","2480950"," Yeah, that's a nice, that's not too bad of a rotation."
"2482990","2483890"," That's not too bad. "
"2484870","2486630"," So we're going to look at Spy real quick, okay?"
"2489010","2490450"," We got a problem on the Spy."
"2491770","2495310"," The problem is that you've got these sellers stepping in up here."
"2495790","2497850"," You really want to see these sellers up here. "
"2498110","2506090"," So it could be one of two things that we're not trading higher until we get more call structure on"
"2506090","2506390"," the Spy."
"2507930","2518290"," It means that there are some very serious sellers stepping in above at 4.73. You"
"2518290","2523630"," know, there's some bears out there that are thinking that we're not going to 4.78. There are some"
"2523630","2528550"," bears out there that are thinking that OPEX is coming and that we're selling down into next week"
"2528550","2530090"," one way or another."
"2530490","2538090"," So then there are some long-term call holders that just want out of their calls so that they can"
"2538090","2538850"," turn bearish. "
"2539150","2541170"," So keep that in the back of your mind as we're trading here."
"2542310","2550690"," If we do try up to 4.73 or 4.75, you could start to enter two-week, put spreads"
"2550690","2556550"," in the money, maybe add to them up to a 480 mark, just add some protection, some downside"
"2556550","2557790"," protection to OPEX."
"2558790","2564510"," I find it hard to believe that whatever spreads are out there for this month's OPEX are as high as"
"2564510","2572470"," 4.78, which would mean that they might trade us down to some more normal level, 4.65, 4.70,"
"2572750","2574410"," even if we trade higher right now. "
"2578890","2579870"," Yeah, 14 days."
"2580850","2582470"," Yeah, that's not too bad."
"2582470","2584410"," So I like the 28 days home though. "
"2586770","2587970"," Good morning, motion."
"2588550","2589530"," Most and good morning."
"2592030","2594090"," Yeah, it was Andy that Diamond Handed. "
"2594170","2597210"," Andy was the guy that was out there, Diamond Handing calls all week long."
"2602780","2606920"," Paul Singh is short, M2K for how long?"
"2607580","2610620"," For a gap fill, can't build volume above PM high?"
"2611020","2612360"," Yeah, Paul, I agree with you."
"2612960","2613920"," I'm seeing this. "
"2614200","2619900"," I'm trying to, let me bring up a flow I'll go right now, trying to see if that's the thing"
"2619900","2621360"," is you need to get the bulls."
"2621900","2624020"," If you want to go higher, you need to see the bulls."
"2624880","2626420"," Oh, there's some coming in right now. "
"2626520","2628660"," There's some call flow coming in right now."
"2629600","2633580"," There's some call flow coming in for the 14th, 4.72 C's."
"2634040","2635740"," BA has call flow coming in right now. "
"2635860","2636720"," Heavy call flow in BA."
"2637320","2638320"," Massive, actually."
"2638780","2640580"," Disney has call flow coming in. "
"2640940","2642320"," That's a shout out to your wife's boyfriend."
"2643160","2646780"," February 18th, 165 C for 200 K."
"2647780","2651940"," Fck has some call flow coming in May 20th, 50 C."
"2652320","2653440"," I like that trade a lot."
"2653540","2654660"," That's a very safe trade. "
"2655160","2656940"," I like that Fck trade."
"2657600","2659240"," BP pumping this morning."
"2659720","2663380"," March 18th, 34 C, 33 C on BP. "
"2664100","2666160"," BP has got massive flow coming in on it."
"2669550","2670650"," I'm still not seeing."
"2670830","2672090"," I'm seeing mostly spike. "
"2672350","2673490"," I've been seeing some spy calls."
"2674310","2678750"," A little bit of spy puts, but you know, it's not what you need to see."
"2679190","2684750"," There is a February 18th, 449 put for $1.7 million. "
"2685610","2689650"," I don't know that that is anything more than a hedge."
"2690750","2692570"," I don't I think that's a hedge."
"2692610","2694750"," I don't think that that is a put. "
"2695590","2697810"," And it's a cheap hedge."
"2698170","2701470"," So I can't say that I'm not going to say, yeah, there's another one here too."
"2704410","2709750"," $2.5 million at 449 on a spy hedge. "
"2710070","2711050"," IWM hedge."
"2713970","2718370"," $2.09 for February 18th."
"2720110","2725250"," That's for $3.9 million on that hedge. "
"2725870","2727610"," $5 million on a spy hedge."
"2728590","2735110"," But I don't think that these are I don't think these are the buy the let's take a look at"
"2735110","2735230"," it."
"2735230","2736010"," I'm real quick. "
"2737130","2739930"," Something negative might be setting itself up here."
"2744020","2750600"," I don't when I see hedges when we're heading higher and we're not at the rock bottom, I'm not as"
"2750600","2751180"," concerned."
"2753140","2758760"," I don't like seeing hedges that are taken when we're at rock bottom. "
"2762490","2769130"," But we're going to look for some we're going to look to see if those buyers are still there on"
"2770790","2772370"," the spy down at 450."
"2773690","2775610"," I had some real concern with that."
"2798680","2804350"," Does anybody know anything that's going on out there right now?"
"2806290","2808230"," Yeah, I'm going to take the cues right now for you. "
"2812950","2815390"," No, you're not gamma neutral."
"2815790","2817010"," So you're in a volatility."
"2819370","2821890"," Well, that's hard to that's hard to say. "
"2822650","2829830"," You're in a so you're in there's no real such thing as positive and negative gamut's a bad"
"2829830","2830810"," subscriber."
"2830810","2830930"," No, you're not a bad subscriber."
"2836470","2839190"," Neutral is not a bad way to describe it. "
"2840890","2842110"," We're not negative gamma."
"2843270","2845870"," We are not in a volatility zone right now."
"2846570","2852350"," And we're looking above right now to see if bulls are willing to buy calls. "
"2852670","2858030"," That's the truth that we're we're poking above right now in the market, taking a look above to see"
"2858030","2860090"," if there's interest if we go higher."
"2860090","2865870"," we talked about that yesterday right we're gonna take a look above we're gonna get past the numbers"
"2865870","2875050"," today the event today to eat wins FOMC I got to check something here because I have some real"
"2875050","2884330"," concern where we are it's not so bad"
"2884330","2903850"," this should still rip higher there"
"2903850","2912850"," are calls coming in for DT Delta Tango May 20th 65C 2.5 million"
"2912850","2921910"," dollars BA still has calls coming in on it Nike we talked about those Nike calls yesterday I"
"2921910","2931830"," want you guys to be concerned at this point okay I like to see hedging but"
"2931830","2943610"," so I got so I'm gonna story for you about what you want to see there's"
"2943610","2951770"," some support down there at 380 I want you guys to know that what you like to see is you"
"2951770","2960510"," like to see hedging done it's a really weird place right here too"
"2960510","2968410"," so in the cues right the support at 380 has disappeared there is supply"
"2968410","2984430"," right where we are right now right 387 13 with a"
"2984430","2994100"," sip water here the hero indicator is turning slightly negative on"
"2994100","3003020"," the cues there's SQ calls coming in right now"
"3003020","3011360"," January 21st 150 C LCID still has coffee coming into it today even after yesterday"
"3011360","3021980"," I got to say something though to you guys okay got to get this out BA"
"3021980","3029140"," is just a straight green bar at this point it's just going straight to the moon might be peeking"
"3029140","3035640"," out here but there's major call flow still following up with it I need to talk to you guys about"
"3035640","3045600"," something okay I want to take a look at where we think the tops going to be"
"3045600","3052640"," let's say we trade to 475 we trade to 480 478 and then you see some hedge buying and then"
"3052640","3059300"," we melt up further I like to see stuff like that right so we're near top or hedging or we"
"3059300","3066340"," hedge then we start to continue to melt up but at least there was a defined area to take a"
"3066340","3072800"," hedge and then sometimes you'll see hedging when we are crashing or correcting like the worst"
"3072800","3077780"," possible time to buy a hedge it's a trigger for a for a fund or a bank or a family"
"3077780","3083540"," office it's written into their charter like you have to buy it so if we trigger a five percent sell"
"3083540","3092140"," you have to buy some some protection what I don't like is that there's sellers above this low we've"
"3092140","3100680"," got some resistance here right at 473 why is there no resistance that 475 means a little bit of a"
"3100680","3109320"," volume here and some some ice above at 475 85 for 74 94 there's a little band it's not massive"
"3109320","3117900"," the band above here at you know 480 is not that strong"
"3117900","3127860"," we're seeing it 500 right now no we"
"3127860","3137300"," don't see anything at 500 and we still see this by below here at 450 I'm real concerned here guys"
"3137300","3143180"," what you guys let me know in chat right now what do you guys think it's like a setup to"
"3143180","3153460"," me man I can be wrong on this but it's like a effing setup let me"
"3153460","3162430"," know what you think because we're I mean we're ripping right now spy is ripping like we just pinned"
"3162430","3170250"," right here right we just pinged right here 472 85 that's that second rip up we talked about before"
"3170250","3176150"," the bell right if you missed the first rip you wait for the second rip you're tagging above right"
"3176150","3181810"," now for your second time but let me know beyond it don't be good though if you're a normal bear"
"3181810","3190010"," don't talk to me but if you're a bull and if you think thumbs up let me know well yeah"
"3190010","3195510"," it should so yes should tag right off the bell or sell down and then swing back up and tag"
"3195510","3199810"," it at least one more time we talked about that before the bell I told you if you missed the"
"3199810","3206010"," cell on the high wait for the second tap it should always happen every single time but my question"
"3206010","3214010"," is do we go higher here because there's no sellers above here if we break above 473 if we break"
"3214010","3222210"," above 473 44 there's no sailing and I'm watching some major major hedging coming in right now"
"3222210","3228710"," millions and millions of dollars of hedging all right so let's see what everybody thinks"
"3228710","3237110"," all right so no one thinks anything once BA broke 220 was over yep"

"4176790","4182210"," Ron saying I'd be more confident spy testing all new all temp highs if we start rotation back out"
"4182210","4186470"," of value that's I agree with that because it's not crazy bids in the summer and it's not happening"
"4186470","4196240"," wouldn't it crush anything I"
"4196240","4206220"," don't think it crushes spreads not not spy spreads you think time it out to the 28th for"
"4206220","4211580"," credit spreads or do you think I get the debit spread so that doesn't matter as long as they close"
"4211580","4220220"," below do you think we'll close below 476 on the 26th and then I could do debit spreads it wouldn't"
"4220220","4229820"," matter I just have to close them right at the bell on that Friday on"
"4229820","4245240"," that I'm a bull but I don't believe that bullshit that tards trades not tards you"

"4257040","4263040"," out to party maybe they'll just keep adding it until we get to 478 maybe that's what's happening"
"4263040","4272440"," yeah I agree with you Winky"
"4272440","4278820"," hundred percent we could be 480 on that day it's a fair point we're not shorting when I get into"

"4284800","4291740"," okay if you're a bear we trade this market to the right as Joe says right we trade that we"
"4291740","4297080"," definitely should the spies built to go up that's what it's done that's what it's built to do so"
"4297080","4303840"," you should be bearish like 30% of the time so as we go up you want to ask yourself"
"4303840","4310120"," where do I put protection on how much risk do I put on in protection right so if we grew"

"5265000","5291940"," I'll"
"5295680","5299120"," spread FMC on 126."
"5302700","5305080"," A bearish. "
"5309640","5314440"," It's about 8% per year."
"5317640","5319240"," FMC on 126."
"5325850","5327170"," What do I need to know about this?"
"5329090","5330430"," What do I need to know to write?"
"5330810","5332050"," What do you need to know in this?"
"5349070","5349950"," All right. "
"5352470","5358510"," Yeah, so if you sign up for options.ai, they will do a quick."
"5358510","5361830"," They'll show you the chance of success on the trade."
"5362750","5366910"," The percentage, I just posted the cost and the profit that you'll make. "
"5367830","5372090"," It shows a graph that shows you how to."
"5373670","5378950"," I have had a different graph up, but it didn't show well how the trade actually works."
"5379470","5382510"," So I wrote on it, you'll see that we'll swing higher. "
"5382510","5385530"," I would say that let's say we go up to."
"5387970","5391170"," Let's say we hit like 482."
"5391610","5396450"," Let's say we tap out a 482 into next week and we swing lower. "
"5398250","5401750"," Your at max profit, anything below 476."
"5403470","5405190"," You'll gain $71."
"5406450","5411630"," You gain like a small profit if you're below 478. "
"5412170","5420130"," But if you end below 476 on the 26th, you'll make max gain."
"5420770","5426530"," So there's my hedge heading into the rest of this trade."
"5426910","5428990"," So now I'm going to get bullish on the market. "
"5434410","5436110"," We'll check the spy real quick."
"5437270","5442290"," Yeah, so check out options.ai and I can do a class on it too if you guys really want"
"5442290","5442550"," me to."
"5442550","5445470"," If you guys don't trade spreads, I'll do a class on it. "
"5448750","5450190"," Let me go through and read this stuff."
"5451170","5452430"," Sorry, I wasn't reading anything."
"5457400","5458820"," Test was looking very sexy. "
"5464150","5465630"," Okay, so let me go up a little bit."
"5466870","5468190"," Test the resistance above."
"5468930","5469190"," Let's say it. "
"5470770","5471270"," Hold on."
"5471370","5472610"," I'm missing a bunch of you guys talking."
"5472610","5473390"," Tesla. "
"5476150","5477670"," Yeah, let's go skiing together."
"5478790","5480530"," Yeah, and Vasco always use protection."
"5481250","5483410"," We should do more about spreads and verticals and all that. "
"5483530","5483730"," Okay."
"5484790","5486070"," Let me address a few things."
"5486610","5488770"," First thing, you don't have to put any money in it. "
"5489070","5491150"," You can execute these trades on Robinhood anywhere."
"5491570","5492770"," I don't care where you execute the trades."
"5493930","5503890"," I want you to sign up for options.ai. I'll make a, yeah, we'll do a live stream where"
"5503890","5508890"," I put it up on the screen and I'll walk you through the entire process of how to trade on"

"5515330","5520330"," So I'm going to walk you through how to trade basic, basic, basic spreads."
"5526020","5527900"," Captain Ron, where are you skiing, man?"
"5528220","5530020"," Which, which, which, which mountain brighten?"
"5531440","5534440"," Yeah, the heroin indicator on Tesla is still strong."
"5535820","5537340"," I still love Tesla air. "
"5537960","5539200"," Mughals and snowboards don't mix."
"5540680","5542780"," Joey, which brighten, which mountain brighten?"
"5543100","5543760"," Oh, yeah, man."
"5544180","5545600"," I've got an epic ski pass, John. "
"5545740","5546140"," Let's go skiing."
"5547840","5549560"," I got the wife and the kids and everything."
"5550320","5551700"," I'll come out there and we'll, we'll stride together. "
"5555740","5556440"," Hell yeah."
"5556840","5557360"," We're mud up."
"5557560","5557960"," Modal. "
"5558120","5559580"," Where are you moving to in Colorado, bruv?"
"5559660","5560400"," I used to live there too."
"5561700","5562540"," I love Breck."
"5563080","5565040"," Remember, go to Breck on vacations. "
"5566000","5566800"," Leave on probation."
"5567780","5569580"," Don't catch a DWI in Breckenridge."
"5570220","5572420"," They are famous for handing out DWIs there. "
"5573020","5574060"," Drink a glass of wine."
"5576680","5580680"," And you know, you leave up from dinner and the cops are waiting for you right outside."
"5581700","5582400"," Oh, man. "
"5582480","5583640"," Are my, are my puts printing?"
"5584340","5585080"," Wait a minute."
"5585120","5586200"," I got to check my puts there."
"5593230","5594370"," Are my puts printing?"
"5595010","5595930"," Hell yeah, they are. "
"5598370","5599470"," My puts are printing."
"5610660","5611100"," Hilarious."
"5611500","5614820"," There goes, there goes Big Daddy Captain James's puts printing already. "
"5615620","5616380"," Thank you very much."
"5616400","5617340"," I appreciate it."
"5617800","5618640"," Thank you spy. "
"5619380","5621400"," Thank you for me buying the top of spy."
"5623760","5624560"," I'm terrible."
"5625140","5626940"," I'm like the worst guy out there. "
"5628380","5631020"," You got all these bears, not time and shit, right?"
"5631240","5632960"," Then you got Captain Jim James, the bull."
"5633440","5634660"," Time in the top perfectly."
"5638380","5639320"," Too hilarious. "
"5641620","5645600"," Yeah, the discord will have all these bots in it."
"5645680","5646300"," It's going to be beautiful."
"5649040","5651660"," And I'm on directional spreads right now. "
"5651980","5654040"," Oh, man."
"5654200","5654960"," This is too fucking."
"5655120","5655400"," Oh, sorry. "
"5655560","5655960"," Should be swearing."
"5658480","5659540"," Something to think about."
"5659700","5661220"," I'm going to scroll through all this. "
"5667120","5668520"," I hate you guys."
"5668700","5670880"," You're seeing a small reversal in value stocks."
"5680160","5681580"," I time the top perfectly. "
"5683760","5687760"," Look at that, huh?"
"5688240","5688700"," Shazam."
"5690140","5692860"," I bet you Derek Cote and he's listening in right now."
"5692980","5694300"," He's like pounding the desk. "
"5694500","5695060"," I hate him."
"5695560","5696680"," I love Derek, by the way."
"5696820","5699060"," I'm just breaking his balls if he is listening in right now. "
"5705480","5706680"," Get up that."
"5706800","5708580"," My puts are printing right now, so."
"5712860","5713920"," This is too funny. "
"5719940","5723160"," You know the bears want to see me burn, but I trade both sides."
"5724820","5727040"," You got firm support on Tesla down here."
"5728000","5731380"," I got some nice support at 1092, 1080, 1070. "
"5731940","5733880"," You know where the real buyers are down at 1050."
"5734080","5734260"," They were."
"5735160","5736340"," They moved up a bit. "
"5737080","5740960"," Your wall is moving up on Tesla, so I'm still positive on Tesla overall."
"5748540","5749880"," I can't believe it."
"5751040","5752880"," Where's the buy the fucking dip level again?"
"5753540","5754000"," I'll let you go. "
"5754160","5754460"," Hold on."
"5757200","5759120"," Yeah, I like Derek."
"5759420","5760320"," I like Derek a lot. "
"5760500","5761040"," He's a great trader."
"5761620","5762600"," All in all honesty."
"5762920","5763980"," He's made me a lot of money. "
"5764580","5766180"," He's one of the bears that I can trust."
"5770200","5774180"," I can't trust some of these bulls and I can't trust some of these bears that are always."
"5774620","5780440"," We're going to 500 tomorrow and we're going to 250 today because I can't get a real read on what"
"5780440","5781360"," the real deal is. "
"5781360","5785580"," Okay, so die spy, die, die, die."
"5786360","5791760"," Yeah, I'll look at net right now."
"5792060","5793160"," I can't believe that just happened. "
"5795380","5796020"," Stoked."
"5797260","5800360"," Look at that."
"5800460","5802500"," Look at that spy trade outstanding. "
"5805100","5807220"," Look at that spy trade."
"5807960","5808400"," Look at that."
"5809280","5810600"," Listen to the captain. "
"5817720","5818360"," Wow."
"5818780","5819820"," Ryan Watford."
"5820240","5821820"," Thank you very much, my man. "
"5822200","5830440"," Ryan Watford just joined the Joe Donut crowd and the John M crowd and the Belgian crowd."
"5833340","5835340"," Yeah, master trader was right."
"5836000","5839000"," Yeah, I approve. "
"5839200","5841340"," So I'll get in there and I'll prove you guys today."
"5841340","5847160"," I put I put the he is a legend."
"5847360","5847960"," I love that guy. "
"5848180","5851780"," When he first came on to Twitter, no one no one everyone thought he was serious."
"5852240","5853780"," And of course I knew right away."
"5853920","5854820"," I was like, this guy is hilarious. "
"5854820","5856820"," Like he's doing this intentionally."
"5857920","5859600"," That was banging right there, right?"
"5859780","5860720"," That trade was sick."
"5861120","5862700"," That trade was sick. "
"5866780","5867820"," Trade was banging."
"5870980","5872400"," Should I sell for profit?"
"5872600","5874600"," Dude, you should see how much I'm up right now."
"5878630","5879590"," This is insane. "
"5883180","5884280"," This is insane."
"5885300","5886220"," Oh, man."
"5893170","5897590"," Yeah, chase. "
"5897890","5898490"," Where were you, brother?"
"5899770","5900830"," Where were you, Chase?"
"5901990","5906210"," Dude, you leave like the one time I buy a freaking short man or buy a put."
"5913040","5914780"," You guys are hilarious out there."
"5916340","5917280"," You welcome James. "
"5919280","5921120"," All right, we're going to look at spy right now."
"5922380","5922960"," All right."
"5923220","5925080"," I don't know if that was a trick to go long again. "
"5925400","5926040"," That could have been a trick."
"5927000","5928580"," But boy, they're smooth, aren't they?"
"5928720","5933860"," These guys, these fucking banks, man, these fucking banks are, they think they're so fucking slick."
"5937380","5938440"," I'll check IWM. "
"5940540","5942760"," I don't know where the buy the dip level is."
"5942840","5944940"," I'm assuming that you're going to get a dip buy here."
"5945020","5948880"," But the problem is that it'll get rejected. "
"5949780","5953700"," It's going to get rejected probably at VWAP."
"5954440","5962440"," Look for rejection at 471.8. What you'll see is anyone in calls, they'll, they're right now."
"5962460","5966300"," Anyone that's in calls will say to themselves, please, please, please go up so I can get out of my"
"5966300","5966520"," calls. "
"5967040","5967900"," I'm still going to tell themselves."
"5968980","5973960"," So they'll, we'll ramp up right here and then we'll, we'll, we'll sell right back down."
"5975580","5977280"," In my, in my view, we will. "
"5981560","5985520"," Before the bell, though, we did talk about slapping that 469, right?"
"5986780","5988000"," We talked about."
"5991140","5993700"," I might just print some heavy, heavy shit today again."
"5996140","5997080"," Yes, I will. "
"5997280","5997560"," I will."
"5997820","5998320"," It depends."
"5999040","6005500"," It depends on, it depends on where I'm buying those or selling those positions. "
"6006360","6012260"," If I pick them up on, if I execute them on tasty, I can cut legs off those trades."
"6013300","6019140"," If I, if I execute them on Robinhood, I don't think that I can't."
"6019180","6022420"," I think Robinhood, maybe you can cut a leg loose. "
"6022620","6023860"," I'm not positive on Robinhood."
"6024040","6025120"," Tasty works you can."
"6025680","6028600"," Options AI, I'm not sure if you can or can't, I'd have to look into that. "
"6034310","6035510"," No, I don't think we're going down."
"6035710","6036450"," I think it's just a reset."
"6036890","6039250"," I don't, I don't know that I'm this negative on the market. "
"6039630","6042150"," My problem is with that hedging that came out was brutal."
"6043190","6044610"," I don't like that hedge."
"6045130","6047690"," And then I don't like that we don't have call expansion right now. "
"6047770","6048610"," We've discussed this, right?"
"6048770","6053430"," I talked to you guys at Nazim about this for the past half an hour, I think, before it even"
"6053430","6054030"," happened, right?"
"6054410","6055270"," We're getting up there."
"6055690","6060110"," We talked about the second rip higher, talked about the green bar off the bell, or even a red bar"
"6060110","6064870"," than a green bar, second green bar, so that don't panic, right?"
"6065250","6066150"," Get, then sell your calls."
"6066870","6070430"," But then as we were up here today, we saw a shit ton of hedging coming in. "
"6070430","6073470"," We didn't see call expansion coming in to the market."
"6074370","6078990"," And so we started talking about hedging your, hedging your positions or starting to lay on"
"6078990","6082130"," protective hedging that's not aggressive, not FD's or anything."
"6082690","6085650"," And of course, some of the futures traders out there are like, screw that. "
"6085750","6086630"," I'm going deep balls."
"6086830","6088190"," It balls deep on short right now."
"6088490","6089150"," Because that's their option. "
"6089310","6089790"," That's all they have."
"6090410","6091430"," That's all they can do."
"6098440","6101940"," They got 211 people checking in right now. "
"6104520","6106140"," Yeah, you know, you take your profits and run."
"6106400","6107900"," I'm going to look at net right now for you guys."
"6108740","6109820"," See how we're doing on net. "
"6110100","6111620"," That was a really weird morning right there."
"6111680","6113340"," Net's crashing through support right now."
"6113800","6115040"," It's just blasting through. "
"6116640","6117980"," It's blasting through support."
"6118120","6119620"," That was heavy support right here on net."
"6120080","6121740"," You're getting a little bit of bounce on $13. "
"6122380","6124000"," Let's see where the real money is on net."
"6124640","6125940"," I'm so sure someone wants to know."
"6126740","6128540"," Real money on net's down at $100. "
"6129540","6135060"," Firm support above at $122.46. We'll see if net can hold on here."
"6135160","6136880"," I'll leave this up wherever's on net right now."
"6137220","6138260"," This is pretty rough right here. "
"6138840","6140960"," I wouldn't panic sell just yet on net."
"6142380","6144600"," I'll try to put the hero indicator up for you."
"6144820","6145880"," See if it works. "
"6147780","6148540"," That was wild."
"6149000","6150080"," I can't believe that just happened."
"6151120","6152440"," Talk about being quick, huh?"
"6157140","6158700"," Talk about being quick. "
"6161660","6162960"," Talk about being quick."
"6163340","6164100"," How many of you guys?"
"6164580","6166640"," I love legging in."
"6166840","6169540"," Yeah, I like starting out with safe plays. "
"6170380","6172560"," Then I get more aggressive and more aggressive and more aggressive."
"6173500","6174500"," I want you guys out there."
"6176480","6177760"," Hood's getting chopped up too. "
"6178380","6180880"," The hero indicator doesn't work on every stock."
"6180880","6182660"," So I can't give you an answer."
"6182720","6184920"," It doesn't work on net, but you do. "
"6185060","6186340"," You are crashing into some support."
"6186820","6189440"," Looks like the real money's down at $111."
"6190000","6193640"," And you've got further support down at $100, I believe. "
"6194100","6194620"," We'll look again."
"6196060","6197280"," And I'm going to show hood."
"6198200","6200480"," You had some support down here at $110. "
"6201200","6202520"," You know, this is not good to see."
"6202720","6206600"," Either the buyers stepped up here or they disappeared at $110."
"6206600","6208620"," I'd be real careful here on net. "
"6213050","6218350"," Then I'm going to bring up a hood next and see someone's giving a shout out on hood."
"6218490","6220750"," I want to see if hood's coming down to where I want it."
"6221530","6224910"," Because I will buy hood even if we're crashing here or selling off. "
"6226990","6228810"," This would be hilarious though, right?"
"6229390","6232450"," They rope us all in and then they sell the market."
"6232450","6236370"," It would just be that I wouldn't put it."
"6236490","6238810"," I wouldn't put it past them. "
"6239410","6242570"," You know, it's just another day in the market with more bullshit."
"6248480","6253300"," Yeah, so Zach got in some, sold to $0.38, bought back at $0.28, taking the profit from that"
"6253300","6253660"," quick trade."
"6254220","6254520"," Thanks, Cap. "
"6254720","6255200"," You're welcome, Zach."
"6255800","6256360"," I got your brother."
"6257960","6260240"," Anybody that was following along, so I don't have that. "
"6260460","6261800"," So the discord's not public yet."
"6261920","6262400"," It's going to be up."
"6262560","6263620"," I'm going to have it up this week. "
"6263620","6273600"," I'm trying to get some time with Joe Donut and I need to call Quinn so that I need"
"6273600","6275680"," some help on the both sites."
"6277420","6279800"," And Joe's doing all the work on the website."
"6280660","6282280"," You guys, that guy's amazing. "
"6286080","6287520"," I'm still short right here."
"6296260","6297840"," Hood's kind of falling off a cliff here."
"6297840","6299960"," Let's see if the buyers are still down. "
"6301180","6302100"," They've moved lower."
"6303420","6309780"," Buyers have now moved down from $15.60 or $15.80 and $16 all the way down to $15."
"6311440","6313000"," This wasn't here the other day. "
"6313960","6315200"," I'd be real careful out there, guys."
"6315360","6318520"," If you guys are long right now, I'm going to tell you right now."
"6319100","6321060"," This is a very dangerous place for the market. "
"6322660","6323460"," Warning, okay?"
"6323460","6326960"," I'm telling you guys, warning, warning."
"6329260","6330220"," Warning, okay?"
"6330580","6331280"," Please, warning."
"6334900","6336580"," I'm going to tell you again, warning. "
"6342160","6343800"," Please respect the warning."
"6348790","6350070"," Thank you for the tip, Robert."
"6350350","6350890"," Appreciate it. "
"6350970","6352510"," Robert L, appreciate it, brother."
"6354490","6356730"," I'm telling you, warning right now."
"6356730","6363590"," Some real, real, like, I spent half an hour explaining my position to you guys out there. "
"6364930","6366830"," We tagged 1,100 on Tesla."
"6368010","6371390"," Perfect place for a bank to get outside of a long, right?"
"6373090","6374910"," 1 plus 1 plus 1."
"6376890","6378310"," Yeah, danger will Robinson."
"6384740","6386160"," Just a warning out there. "
"6386460","6390200"," This might just be hedging implications here where we're trading down."
"6390200","6394760"," But I got to tell you guys, man, like, that was not a..."
"6399840","6404040"," Yeah, 4.71. So we'll talk about the vol trigger."
"6404220","6405440"," I'll tell you where the vol trigger is. "
"6405700","6406840"," I mean, I have to look it up real quick."
"6407740","6410420"," Where it was on ES."
"6412980","6413720"," Give me a second. "
"6415720","6417220"," I'll give you the exact vol trigger."
"6424140","6425700"," Josh, thank you for supporting the stream."
"6426180","6429400"," I don't know if anybody else out there giving you guys warnings. "
"6430080","6431860"," We've been talking about it for the past half an hour."
"6432000","6433420"," Before it happened, we talked about it."
"6435620","6438220"," Let's see where the vol trigger is. "
"6438860","6441260"," Yeah, so we're in the volatility zone right now."
"6441340","6450080"," Vol trigger is at 4714.25 and 4703 on ES."
"6450080","6458360"," So if you look at the 15 minute chart, we're right at the top of the vol trigger right now. "
"6462840","6466600"," We're just right at it right now."
"6467900","6469620"," We're right at the vol trigger."
"6470980","6472560"," So fair warning here, okay?"
"6475840","6477200"," Be real careful, guys. "
"6478460","6479940"," I can't stress it enough."
"6484650","6486270"," Yeah, you know, it was really bizarre."
"6486470","6487950"," Like you're not seeing the calls coming in. "
"6488130","6489850"," You're not seeing the call expansion above."
"6490370","6491950"," You're not, you're just not seeing it, right?"
"6492310","6494970"," You're seeing directed call flow into specific stocks."
"6495990","6497930"," You're seeing Tesla ripped to 1100. "
"6498750","6502890"," You're seeing massive call or put hedging coming into the market."
"6503450","6506330"," All dated short to like February 18th, right?"
"6506730","6510550"," There was some, I want to post all the hedging that came in this morning on Twitter for you guys."
"6511210","6513470"," So you guys can see what I'm talking about here. "
"6515410","6519190"," It's a market volatility trigger, market volatility trigger."
"6525100","6533400"," So you use the spy or ES or SPX as your volatility as your bell weather for all stocks, right?"
"6533740","6541740"," And especially if they make up a, especially if they make up a significant part of an index, right?"
"6541740","6547820"," So if you're, if you're, you watch the spy, you can get a feel generally for the market."
"6548500","6556280"," So I'm going to, I'm going to post on Twitter right now, the, the put flow that came through here,"
"6556280","6556560"," okay?"
"6557280","6559480"," And net has some major put flow on it. "
"6559920","6565340"," They've got six June, or June 17th, 100 P, pinning action maybe."
"6573180","6576140"," So I'm going to show you guys this hedging flow that came in."
"6576140","6579400"," Now, sometimes we recover from this hedging activity. "
"6579760","6581000"," So we might recover right now."
"6582840","6587560"," And if they're accounting for this hedging activity, I'm going to post this stuff on Twitter right"
"6587560","6588900"," now for you."
"6597690","6601870"," Let me see if I get some of that sweet premium in the puts right now. "
"6601950","6603270"," Yep, I've got some sweet premium."
"6609610","6614530"," So there's the hedging that came in on the three major indexes, at least on cash market."
"6614530","6616970"," This could just be an effect of that hedging too. "
"6617350","6619430"," We could start to trade higher here."
"6620030","6625870"," So we'll look at, let's look at, we're getting a bounce on Tesla here."
"6627650","6632790"," Let's see if we can look at the, where that support was on Tesla once more. "
"6633030","6634610"," Just try to take a look at it again."
"6637110","6640130"," Your same call volume increase on Tesla right at this moment."
"6640130","6643070"," Right here, indicator went from super negative to super positive. "
"6643570","6650930"," You now have buyers overtaking sellers on Tesla down at 10.82. You're back to your new price target"
"6650930","6660520"," of 11.10. You've got some pretty decent support down here of 10.71. So that could just be that"
"6660520","6661920"," hedging activity that took place."
"6667640","6670220"," Yeah, yeah, MGI agree with you here."
"6673840","6677900"," Vol trigger is there's no real up or down bias. "
"6679440","6681320"," So what you're looking for is this."
"6681480","6683540"," So you've got, let me start at the top."
"6683760","6688880"," Okay, you've got, you've got an absolute gamma on, on the top and the bottom. "
"6688880","6695100"," And that just me, all that really means in simple terms is we don't have calls above."
"6696920","6700240"," Let's say right now, let's say I don't have any call structure above 500."
"6702520","6705900"," Like structure, like big, big call positions above 500. "
"6706720","6710580"," And then we don't have big put positions below 5, 450 right now."
"6711460","6714060"," There might be puts out there, but not big positions."
"6714840","6717480"," So those are your absolute gamma strikes above and below. "
"6718860","6723860"," Then the next level down, you have where most of the call strikes are, right?"
"6723960","6725180"," Or most of the put strikes are."
"6726840","6728100"," Or a significant level."
"6728460","6734220"," So you'll have like 478, let's say right now, and then 460s on the bottom side. "
"6735240","6738740"," And there's some expectation you're going to trade to both of those ranges at some point."
"6739560","6745320"," Or attempt to, depending upon as the flow comes in from that standard, right?"
"6745940","6749200"," Then you've got, let's say in the middle, you've got a volatility trigger."
"6750840","6752600"," You've got that trigger. "
"6753400","6758520"," There's other volatility, or there's volatility zones in between the volatility trigger in the"
"6758520","6758760"," middle."
"6759680","6761300"," You've got different volatility zones."
"6762140","6767120"," And when you're in that volatility trigger, you can swing violently in that area, right?"
"6768020","6769740"," Just above and just below it. "
"6770260","6774320"," And then there's some safe areas in between where there's not a lot of volatility."
"6774320","6778740"," And then there's negative and positive gamma laced in there."
"6780140","6784000"," At some point when you're heading down below the volatility trigger, if you break through the"
"6784000","6789740"," volatility trigger, there's a point between there and the put wall where you enter negative gamma. "
"6790700","6792480"," And that's where you take that bear stance."
"6793180","6796960"," So right now the market is above the volatility trigger."
"6797260","6800780"," It's breaking, it's trying to work its way back above the volatility trigger. "
"6800780","6806880"," And this would, you would take a bear, or bullish stance from here if we trade higher."
"6807520","6813440"," If we break below the volatility trigger, you're going to start to take a bear stance and expect"
"6813440","6814200"," that we had lower."
"6814720","6821980"," If we bounce off the lower put walls, you're going to then take a bullish stance until we move up. "
"6822340","6825280"," Until we break through the volatility trigger, then you're full bull."
"6825280","6833980"," So if we are able to maintain today 4, 7, 1, 4, 3 or so, or 4, 71, 14 or"
"6833980","6834240"," so."
"6834700","6840220"," If we were able to maintain this area right here this afternoon, then we would still keep a bullish"
"6840220","6844140"," perspective that we're still trading higher. "
"6845180","6850360"," And this move down right here could just be the impact of the hedging that took place."
"6850360","6858700"," So you're going to now look on the options flow for what flow follows this, right?"
"6859140","6860560"," Do we see call flow follow this?"
"6860760","6868180"," If we start to see the banks buying heavy calls, which I'm seeing right now, I'm seeing calls"
"6868180","6869160"," coming in on AMD."
"6870940","6881270"," February 4th, 138c, Spy, January 12th, 471c, QQQs, January"
"6881270","6890230"," 14th, 387c, AMD, January 14th, 134c, American Airlines, 22 grand. "
"6892820","6895200"," So you want to see more call flow coming in after."
"6895940","6900560"," If you start to see more put flow coming in after the hedges are put on, that's bad."
"6902300","6908040"," If you see hedges put on and then you see call flow coming in, that's good, right?"
"6908280","6917020"," So you want to be, you want to be conscious of when hedges come in, are we seeing, so hedges"
"6917020","6919040"," put hedges and puts are different. "
"6919920","6922400"," Okay, you see put hedge come in, it's one thing."
"6922720","6926100"," If you see puts come in following it, it's very negative."
"6926340","6928660"," If you see calls following it, it's positive. "
"6928660","6932960"," It means that it's just banks protecting themselves as we make a move higher."
"6935960","6937740"," And there is some call flow coming in right now."
"6939420","6941180"," But I'm staying in these puts, right?"
"6942060","6950940"," So I followed the banks with put hedges, put spread hedges so that I can deal with whatever"
"6950940","6955880"," volatility there is where we are right now and protect myself if I'm going to take a bullish"
"6955880","6956460"," position. "
"6958020","6959200"," Does that make sense?"
"6959400","6959620"," I don't know."
"6959760","6961220"," I have to do a whole video on this with you guys."
"6964160","6966780"," Josh, left my ass off, everything is fine. "
"6974670","6983470"," Vol trigger right now is currently at 470 and 471.4. The 4710,"
"6983970","6986230"," or let me take a look again."
"6988510","6993070"," It's at 4714 on ES and 4700."
"6996970","6998290"," And we're below it right now. "
"6998490","7000030"," We're in the middle of the volatility trigger."
"7006670","7009370"," You guys following me out there when I talk to you guys about this stuff?"
"7009750","7010530"," You guys think I'm a weirdo?"
"7010530","7013050"," I love chase."
"7013510","7014410"," So everything is fine. "
"7016030","7016990"," Still not much volume."
"7017250","7017390"," I agree."
"7017630","7019170"," There's not a lot of volume in calls right now. "
"7020890","7022670"," So it's somewhat safe for puts right now."
"7022850","7023190"," No chase."
"7023890","7024410"," No chase. "
"7024770","7031070"," It was safe for puts at 47320."
"7032030","7033350"," That's when it was safe for puts."
"7035030","7038620"," It was safe for puts there, bro. "
"7045160","7046740"," The VIX is coming down, you're saying?"
"7046920","7047540"," Let me look at the VIX."
"7053500","7054320"," What up, Will?"
"7063850","7066530"," Is the VIX bearish right now?"
"7066710","7068710"," You're asking if the VIX is bearish?"
"7069270","7069750"," Let me look and see."
"7071710","7074390"," No, it's not bearish right now. "
"7074870","7075870"," On the intraday, it's not."
"7076410","7078230"," On the one minute, it's not bearish."
"7078870","7083090"," It just broke above a descending wedge. "
"7084250","7088210"," And it's finding support on top of that descending wedge."
"7088690","7089950"," It's not an ascending wedge."
"7090150","7092750"," It's a descending wedge on the VIX on the one minute. "
"7095490","7101270"," And it just snapped above the major resistance channel."
"7102970","7104690"," Just snapped above it, right?"
"7104690","7108110"," So now it's looking to find some support and probably trade higher."
"7108410","7110490"," I'll show you this right here so you can see what I'm talking about. "
"7110610","7113910"," I'll post it on Twitter so you guys can see what I'm saying."
"7119610","7120790"," So you guys can see what's up."
"7123130","7124270"," It's not bullish. "
"7125350","7126150"," I'll give you that."
"7127930","7129610"," It's not bullish on the intraday."
"7131350","7134650"," I'm going to show you what makes it not bullish here, okay?"
"7135250","7136070"," So we just snapped. "
"7136450","7137670"," I want you to see this."
"7141920","7143360"," So we just snapped above."
"7143680","7144540"," We just broke through. "
"7145620","7148240"," I'm going to point to where resistance is here and show you guys."
"7152510","7153550"," That's a good question."
"7153730","7154610"," Whoever asked that question. "
"7155530","7160770"," So this line right here is resistance."
"7188670","7191190"," I'll post this right now for you guys so you guys can get."
"7192650","7199270"," When you guys are trading the VIX as a pear trade or as something to watch, I want you to"
"7199270","7202490"," set it to the two minute or the one minute chart. "
"7203340","7206370"," And we creeped right over resistance."
"7206830","7207850"," I just posted it just now."
"7208610","7212190"," We just creeped right over resistance just now. "
"7212970","7213790"," It's very sneaky."
"7216790","7222010"," Now if we break back through that resistance right, that yellow line, if we break through that"
"7222010","7224590"," yellow line, you'd become bullish again."
"7226250","7228270"," But it did sneak over just now. "
"7229270","7232710"," So I'm still in a, I'm going to bear stance at the moment."
"7232930","7234030"," I'm not taking along yet."
"7237350","7239390"," Oh, we just broke through spy some more, huh?"
"7239730","7241250"," I didn't even see that we broke through spy. "
"7247310","7248290"," It's, yeah, winky."
"7248530","7250330"," It's not 11.30 yet."
"7253930","7254990"," We're drilling, baby. "
"7255610","7256590"," We're drilling for oil."
"7260870","7263990"," Yeah, there's a little spike right now."
"7263990","7265990"," I would not trust where we are right now. "
"7266230","7269290"," Do not trust where we are on the spy at all."
"7271740","7274180"," You guys want to see where real support is on the spy?"
"7277080","7281440"," Even though we're saving by the bell here, you guys want to see where real support is?"
"7282940","7288080"," Some of you guys follow me on Twitter and saw me yesterday say that there was a, there was a"
"7288080","7289840"," new buyer down below it, 450."
"7290600","7292420"," There they are right there, 450. "
"7293680","7300840"," These guys snuck in yesterday, real, real silent like this morning you saw the hedging coming in,"
"7301540","7301940"," right?"
"7304000","7305500"," We're drilling for oil, baby."
"7305700","7307120"," What am I, what am I, what's that now?"
"7309480","7310520"," This is hilarious."
"7311860","7312280"," Burr. "
"7320340","7325480"," Yeah, so what do you, what do you, I want to know what you guys think?"
"7325840","7327280"," Yeah, there's no real support right now."
"7328780","7329720"," There's no support."
"7329960","7334540"," No matter what anybody's telling you out there in real, in real world time, we've got way more"
"7334540","7336920"," sellers than buyers, right?"
"7337500","7339860"," You can see this big thick red bar up here. "
"7341260","7343380"," This is called ice down here."
"7343560","7346040"," You'll see some support that's here at 469."
"7347180","7349140"," Here's some support down below at 468. "
"7349580","7352860"," But you really want to see like a big red bar show up here, right?"
"7353820","7356020"," You want to see big fat red bar show up."
"7356360","7358760"," You want to see where the buyers are and they're not here yet."
"7358900","7360640"," We've got more sellers than buyers right now. "
"7362240","7363780"," Thank you, Josh, for the tip, brother."
"7366020","7366840"," Appreciate it, my brother."
"7367520","7370680"," Yeah, this is hilarious. "
"7371920","7373220"," What do I have for puts?"
"7373480","7380760"," I've got like literally at 473.20. I bought what did I buy?"
"7382540","7385660"," I bought bearish credit call spreads."
"7387260","7390840"," 476 and 478 C's."
"7392020","7393380"," I think their C's are P's. "
"7393520","7394360"," I'm not exactly sure."
"7394360","7398840"," The credit call spreads 476, 478."
"7400260","7402200"," It's my entry into the hedging. "
"7403080","7408140"," I'll get more aggressive with, I'll get more aggressive on one of these snapbacks."
"7409120","7410920"," I'll buy some FD puts at some point."
"7414340","7420880"," There are some, so I see some other, I want to let you guys know that we have CVNA. "
"7421480","7423860"," That's Charlie Victor November Alpha."
"7424700","7427600"," 2.6 million dollars on puts."
"7428540","7432100"," Expiring March 18th, 170 P."
"7433060","7436100"," CVNA, Charlie Victor November Alpha. "
"7437520","7446000"," I'm also seeing some puts coming in on TNA, IWM, Spy, QQQ, Spy, and JD."
"7447740","7450060"," We did get one big dip buyer here."
"7450640","7457880"," A dip buyer on Spy January 14th, 471 C for a half million dollars. "
"7458680","7460860"," So we could see some whip style action today."
"7467030","7468030"," Paul's at long."
"7468230","7469850"," Paul, you see that long too?"
"7470250","7471810"," Did you see that long on the Spy, brother?"
"7472330","7473750"," Half million dollars on calls, bro. "
"7480390","7481910"," So I'm going to do a video for you guys."
"7482070","7482830"," You know what we need to do?"
"7482830","7488190"," We need to do like a, after this, after cash market, one of these days, how about this?"
"7488350","7493670"," If you guys sign up for, if you guys sign up for options.ai, you don't have to fund the"
"7493670","7496030"," account, we're just going to do basic spreads."
"7496510","7501450"," Even if you're familiar with doing spreads out there, I want to show you guys a quick and dirty way"
"7501450","7503810"," to calculate spreads on the fly. "
"7504530","7512690"," And as a matter of fact, this right here was a prime example of being able to execute a faster"
"7512690","7516110"," than most trading software that's out there."
"7516790","7523150"," And knowing which one to buy, knowing what it's going to print and not buying the wrong shit,"
"7523430","7523550"," right?"
"7524210","7530030"," Even though like Tasty does a kickass job on spreads, they do much more exotic spreads."
"7530730","7537450"," There are ways to buy spreads really fast and get the pertinent information that you need. "
"7538270","7539530"," So sign up for that account."
"7539870","7541550"," You should be able to get approved same day."
"7541990","7542870"," Don't even fund it. "
"7544290","7545130"," I've got an account."
"7545290","7546030"," My wife's got an account."
"7546610","7551330"," I'll use my wife's account so you guys can't know who I am or whatever. "
"7552070","7558310"," And I'll bring up my wife's account and we'll go through looking at spreads on that."
"7558510","7563830"," Even just to use it to calculate, even if you execute it somewhere else on the fly, it's your"
"7563830","7566790"," favorite, fast and dirty."
"7567330","7567990"," How much am I going to make?"
"7568530","7569490"," How much am I going to cost me?"
"7570290","7572970"," Which strikes are the best because strikes are very important. "
"7574590","7576190"," Which ones do you buy are critical."
"7577950","7578750"," Just sign up."
"7578870","7579370"," We'll go through it. "
"7579650","7581630"," And then we'll go on to more complex spreads down the road."
"7581750","7583490"," We'll go on to like Tasty Works or Think or Swim."
"7584110","7587510"," And we'll go through the entire process of buying more exotic spreads. "
"7588510","7591950"," Any trader out there should be able."
"7593310","7601290"," To not just buy calls or puts or not just sell calls and puts or not understand the, you know,"
"7601330","7606830"," you can like watch the videos on spreads and complex trades, but you don't really know how to put"
"7606830","7608290"," it together to actually execute one."
"7608290","7608810"," You're kind of fearful. "
"7609250","7611970"," You don't want to lose all your money and buy the wrong stuff or sell the wrong stuff."
"7612510","7616690"," This program really simplifies it for you so you can visualize."
"7617890","7619390"," It really dumps it down. "
"7619390","7621630"," It's like the Robinhood of spread buying, spread buying."
"7622110","7625670"," If Robinhood had a good spread buying or selling program, this would be it."
"7626450","7632630"," And I think it's backed by, I think it's the guys from who are the guys that start to be. "
"7633350","7635090"," There's like a service out there."
"7635850","7636790"," That's behind it."
"7637270","7637790"," Whatever. "
"7638090","7639370"," They're like a machete."
"7641290","7643110"," Binga, Benzinga or something, I think."
"7643390","7647670"," I think those guys are backing the trading platform. "
"7648710","7649950"," I'm not a fan of Benzinga."
"7649950","7651250"," I paid for it once I don't like it."
"7651690","7656310"," I'm not a fan of Benzinga, but they did back this trading platform. "
"7658410","7659810"," Oh, fuck yeah, I'm still in puts."
"7660870","7662150"," I'm not out of my fucking puts."
"7662250","7662550"," You crazy?"
"7663810","7664730"," I got a hedge on dog. "
"7669110","7670330"," I'm still in my puts."
"7670510","7671290"," I'm getting rid of my puts."
"7671430","7675310"," I'm going to wait for all these bears to load up in here and print my puts for me. "
"7676030","7679670"," I want the bears to go full bear and print my puts."
"7679670","7681770"," Because I got in before the bears got in."
"7683810","7685410"," Or the wrong to the right time. "
"7686630","7687910"," Are we going back to 460?"
"7688310","7689450"," There's no real support here."
"7690530","7691470"," I don't see any support."
"7691590","7692350"," You guys see any support?"
"7693230","7695410"," You guys see any big red lines down here?"
"7696050","7697550"," I don't see no big red lines. "
"7697710","7698670"," We're going to crash this market."
"7702060","7703100"," We're going to crash this market."
"7703180","7704480"," I don't see any support in here. "
"7705420","7705720"," None."
"7707580","7708280"," I'm out of way."
"7708600","7709180"," Oh, here we go. "
"7709760","7710580"," Here's some support."
"7711560","7713340"," We have support at 468."
"7716760","7717200"," 468. "
"7719560","7720300"," Right here."
"7721720","7722160"," 468."
"7722520","7723560"," First sign of support. "
"7724860","7727640"," So if we're going to have a snapback moment, maybe I'll probably do."
"7728060","7730680"," Because I'm going to close my puts at right here."
"7730760","7731480"," I'm going to close my puts. "
"7733240","7733680"," 468."
"7735180","7735880"," Look at this."
"7735940","7737380"," We're getting nasty down and dirty. "
"7737540","7738600"," We're going to have another dollar to go to."
"7739440","7741420"," I'm going to hold another dollar to sell off."
"7744070","7748170"," All you bears out there, go find your bear friends and tell them that you know a bear trader that"
"7748170","7749050"," can time it perfectly. "
"7752970","7754650"," Willie's next target is 460."
"7755570","7755590"," What?"
"7757210","7760650"," Next MES target is 4660 for Willie Smoke Me."
"7764140","7765820"," Y'all take a look at Elsa right now. "
"7769380","7771680"," Doughboy is saying that 468 is a spoofer."
"7772200","7774340"," Are you looking at that on ES right now, Doughboy?"
"7782810","7784430"," Because I don't think I have the spoofer."
"7784750","7786570"," I don't think I can run spoofer on cash. "
"7786810","7787790"," I can only run it on futures."
"7806220","7808200"," I'll bring up Tesla next for you, Joey."
"7812890","7817030"," Captain Ron saying that a lot of recently de-spack tickers are holding their gains today. "
"7817030","7822430"," Captain Ron, you want to give an update as to which tickers are holding their bottoms or whatever?"
"7824790","7826090"," Then I'll do Apple next."
"7827230","7828550"," Yeah, okay."
"7830530","7834590"," There's a program for spoofing for BookMap. "
"7835390","7839390"," There's an add-on, but it's telling me that I had a problem loading it this morning."
"7839390","7840710"," Oh shit."
"7844800","7846560"," LCID, Lucid's getting wrecked. "
"7848120","7849380"," Just crash through minute."
"7850640","7852080"," S1, boom, gone."
"7852760","7853540"," S2, right?"
"7853760","7855340"," No, this might be still a part of the same one. "
"7856240","7858020"," 451 getting eaten up."
"7858800","7861980"," Sellers just rolling in on LCID."
"7862680","7865940"," You've got some support at 4434 and LCID. "
"7866340","7867980"," I'll bring up Tesla next for you guys."
"7874350","7877410"," Josh made 150% gains in 15 minutes."
"7881390","7883210"," You guys don't want to see else in fall. "
"7883390","7884590"," I wanted you guys to know that, okay?"
"7885210","7887210"," Because your real bottom's down at like 30 bucks."
"7889030","7891310"," Be careful with LCID."
"7891310","7894610"," You really want to see them maintain where they are right now. "
"7901990","7904150"," I'm going to do Tesla right now for you guys."
"7916440","7926360"," You did see some firm bounce on 468.94. You guys trust that bounce as a snapback play?"
"7929520","7931200"," Firm bounce down below here."
"7931780","7937120"," Looks like the buyer's reached right up a dollar above, which is wild to see here on the spy. "
"7940900","7943440"," You're still seeing really negative flow right now."
"7943780","7946000"," Still more sellers than buyers on the spy."
"7946640","7948520"," I don't know if I'm trusting this bounce yet. "
"7948520","7952360"," Maybe you might get a snapback on this trade right here on..."
"7952360","7954760"," This might be a good snapback opportunity for the spy."
"7956580","7958180"," We'll take a look at the Tesla next."
"7959500","7961800"," You guys are all scared about Tesla at 1089?"
"7966400","7969040"," Or is it just the call value is losing all of its value?"
"7969500","7970120"," Is that what's happening?"
"7973760","7976220"," We'll take a look at Tesla and see if this is a real bottom or not. "
"7976340","7978580"," If you're going to break through or not, you guys want to see?"
"7979860","7981460"," Hang tight there, Joey, I gotcha."
"7986820","7988180"," LCID's got lockup exploration."
"7991300","7993180"," Who yelled their countdown calls?"
"7993540","7994200"," Benjamin just did?"
"7994940","7996060"," It's a war in the spy. "
"7996380","7996840"," Yes, it is."
"7999040","8000240"," What's a snapback?"
"8000440","8001980"," I'll explain that here in just a minute."
"8002720","8006680"," Yes, so a snapback is you hit some support. "
"8009360","8012840"," You guys have noticed when spy drops and you'll see it rip back higher."
"8014000","8015260"," I'll take a look at Uber next."
"8016860","8017900"," Yes, snapbacks higher. "
"8026070","8027330"," You've got that."
"8027730","8029730"," It looks like..."
"8029730","8030790"," Let's take a look at Tesla."
"8031670","8032650"," Tesla's loaded now. "
"8032830","8033450"," What do I do to Tesla?"
"8035390","8036690"," What's going on with Tesla here?"
"8037370","8038170"," Why is Tesla not loading?"
"8038970","8039650"," Why is it locked?"
"8050640","8052080"," I'm going to have a boy Tesla here."
"8062760","8065200"," Joey, it looks like buyers stepped in for you, brother."
"8071550","8073570"," You still have more call buyers than Tesla. "
"8075950","8079770"," You had buyers stepping on Tesla 1083, 1084."
"8080650","8083030"," You have a supply side of buyers at 1079."
"8085470","8087090"," I don't want to say to you..."
"8089670","8094870"," You know what I would say to you, Joe, is that I would say you can stay long in Tesla"
"8094870","8095930"," just by protection. "
"8107880","8109040"," Then I'll do Apple next."
"8113420","8117860"," I'm having a little bit of a difficult time loading Tesla right now."
"8117860","8118680"," We're going to come back to it. "
"8132190","8138370"," The only thing I'll say to you on the 1100C's on Tesla is protection."
"8147010","8149310"," The VIX is still high right now, guys."
"8149830","8155310"," If you guys are watching the VIX right now, the VIX is still bullish at this moment. "
"8155610","8157130"," It's not bearish at this moment."
"8161790","8164830"," The VIX is not bearish at all."
"8168930","8171910"," I'm going to do Apple next, and then I'll do Mara, I think. "
"8176950","8179030"," Joe, take the money and run, brother."
"8181090","8184570"," We had a huge bounce on 175 on Apple."
"8184770","8185030"," Look at that. "
"8186930","8188430"," Huge bounce on Apple."
"8189630","8192309"," I'm finding a little bit of support here at 175."
"8195309","8198410"," I'm going to put the heroin indicator on here. "
"8202240","8204540"," I need to take profit at some point, don't I?"
"8206540","8207920"," Do I take profit here?"
"8208139","8209160"," I might take some profit here."
"8209879","8211600"," I'm going to check on my puts here."
"8228520","8231480"," I'm going to fill in some find a bear to buy my puts. "
"8234580","8235360"," Come on, bears."
"8235700","8236400"," Buy my puts, baby."
"8247980","8250520"," This is not good for Apple either. "
"8251459","8256639"," You're seeing support here in Apple, but you're kind of floating in the sky right now."
"8256760","8258360"," This is not a good look for Apple."
"8259820","8262639"," You've got real support at 168 on Apple. "
"8262920","8263700"," I'll be honest with you."
"8264459","8266320"," You don't want to see charts like this."
"8267040","8270240"," You want to decide when to buy the dip on days like today. "
"8270240","8272820"," Let me give you a warning about days like today, okay?"
"8275860","8278480"," Invariably, the trading day is over for bulls."
"8279620","8280139"," Normally."
"8280480","8284900"," I'm not going to say that you see the dip buy here at 175 on Apple. "
"8285980","8288000"," Think about it from this perspective, okay?"
"8290420","8294240"," Let's say any calls for this week are fucked."
"8294799","8295160"," They're fubar."
"8296299","8301240"," Anyone that's locked into calls right now is going to look to sell out of those calls between now"
"8301240","8301639"," and Friday. "
"8303260","8308920"," This doesn't always happen, but 70-80% of the time, even if we don't go any lower, you're going"
"8308920","8314620"," to see call holders sell out of their positions."
"8316639","8318540"," There'll be attrition in their positions."
"8329049","8333809"," Even if we snap back right here, even though you're seeing the dip being bought on spy right now,"
"8334549","8337350"," all the call holders are fucked, right?"
"8338209","8343950"," Anyone those holding calls above 473-20, all those are gone, right?"
"8345410","8348850"," So they're going to eventually have to sell out of their position or add to their position. "
"8350490","8354209"," You probably have a lot of bears piling in right now."
"8355889","8359290"," I see a ton of spy puts coming in."
"8359610","8362110"," I see mostly spy puts. "
"8362950","8364230"," I see RK puts."
"8364570","8366709"," I see some spy calls."
"8368230","8369430"," eBay calls. "
"8376870","8377570"," ABBV."
"8378469","8380430"," Alpha Bravo Bravo Victor."
"8381750","8385469"," February 18th, 150p, $4.6 million. "
"8390000","8393360"," So you're going to have bears loading up right now."
"8393640","8398840"," You've got bulls that have destroyed calls if they held and didn't take profit."
"8416400","8419420"," Yeah, you want to see the, let me show you the eBay calls for you. "
"8422120","8426360"," eBay calls are January 21st, 66C."
"8426820","8427620"," It's a low bid."
"8427760","8429140"," It's only $44,000. "
"8442220","8448920"," Yeah, so let's say even if we stabilize here, what you'll see is you'll see, you know, you guys"
"8448920","8450360"," have seen, you guys have seen this before, right?"
"8450760","8456800"," You end up seeing like we stabilize and then we slowly sell down into the clothes, right?"
"8456800","8458720"," It ends up being that slow sell down in the clothes."
"8459420","8460680"," Everybody accepts defeat."
"8461940","8464040"," You're trapping the bears, you're trapping the bulls. "
"8465220","8467200"," Bulls will start loading up right now."
"8467340","8469000"," You know the bears, you know the bears are loading up bulls."
"8469220","8470420"," The bears are loading up right now. "
"8470460","8471100"," You know that, right?"
"8477300","8482600"," So even if spies are going to rip higher later, you're going to be looking for the trapped calls"
"8482600","8486040"," holders to get out first, right?"
"8486200","8489800"," You don't enter when the trapped call holders are still trapped."
"8489800","8491800"," And this really wasn't one of those..."
"8492960","8496140"," This really doesn't look to me like one of those..."
"8497360","8502140"," This doesn't look to me like one of those, you know, we're selling the market for 20 minutes, then"
"8502140","8503640"," we're right back into it again, moments."
"8504280","8505500"," It doesn't look like that to me. "
"8508360","8510580"," You really wanted to see a bid come into the market today."
"8511100","8512120"," You wanted to see the look above."
"8512680","8514080"," You wanted to see call expansion. "
"8514400","8515160"," We didn't see any of that."
"8515720","8517580"," We saw major hedging going on."
"8519900","8524040"," At some point today, by end of day, I'll release on Twitter. "
"8524440","8529760"," If I remember, I'll release where all the hedges are so that if you're playing earnings, you can"
"8529760","8533720"," see your favorite tickers if they're included in those hedges."
"8547280","8550600"," Yeah, not great for IVB as moneymakers have been relatively safe for a while."
"8552140","8554840"," Yeah, I like a blood stun to stay in here. "
"8555700","8556960"," You'll see attrition, right?"
"8558580","8560980"," If I had to guess, you'll see attrition at some point today."
"8562840","8565140"," What are some of the other tickers you guys wanted me to look at?"
"8565760","8566580"," I saw someone here."
"8568080","8568920"," Yeah, Paul's long. "
"8570080","8573100"," Yeah, Paul, Paul can probably stay long."
"8573340","8575580"," If you're trading futures, you can stay long here."
"8577320","8579440"," This is a nice snapback that's taking place. "
"8581260","8584040"," As a collar put..."
"8585100","8587080"," I can't touch it on the call side."
"8587180","8587760"," I can't touch it."
"8589500","8590340"," Too risky. "
"8591120","8592340"," There'll be too much burn."
"8594260","8596420"," You guys wanted Mara to next, right?"
"8597500","8601700"," There'll be too much options burned for my tastes."
"8611140","8614020"," Let's see, doing Mara next. "
"8618560","8621480"," The options burned will be real today if you're a call buyer."
"8623120","8625200"," You can trade the bounces, I guess."
"8626060","8627820"," Like this snapback move right here, you can trade. "
"8628840","8630600"," But you're talking about being in and out."
"8630820","8634620"," You're talking about not a lot of premium in those rips right now."
"8636860","8642620"," We're going to get this Mara up here or what?"
"8657130","8658430"," Hero indicators still. "
"8658730","8661190"," Do you remember earlier in the week when I told you guys you see the Hero indicator?"
"8662230","8665550"," And even though the price is going up right now, you see the Hero indicator is negative."
"8666510","8668670"," You see more sellers than buyers right now."
"8670870","8674010"," Yeah, I don't trust this at all. "
"8676050","8680850"," Mara bashed in to support down below here at 29.74 looks like."
"8684350","8688030"," So we'll take a look at Mara and see if this helps anybody out."
"8688890","8689890"," This is a nice sign right here. "
"8689990","8690570"," It's good to see."
"8691270","8698270"," Firm support at $29.54. We'll see where the real money is in Mara."
"8698270","8701690"," I think that is the real note. "
"8702170","8708270"," The real money in Mara is at $25.22. So be conscious of that."
"8708410","8714590"," We have large sellers above at $31.38. Support seems to be at $25."
"8717290","8720510"," Your next level of support on Mara below that. "
"8721010","8723270"," That looks like firm support for now for Mara."
"8724010","8724230"," $25."
"8724630","8725770"," People are willing to buy it there. "
"8725770","8729870"," You got almost double the sellers that you do buyers on Mara."
"8735440","8740580"," You got shorts covering down at $4.68. Nice, a nice short squeeze here happening."
"8743260","8745380"," You guys think there's rejection above here?"
"8745480","8746540"," Do you guys think we trade higher?"
"8748700","8751260"," Let's see if my spreads sold or not. "
"8767660","8770960"," All right, so it's $11.30. I'm probably going to take a break here."
"8772120","8773860"," I see some calls coming in."
"8774160","8776840"," You got all light calls. "
"8777520","8782960"," You're like spy one, January 19th, 472c at $134."
"8785640","8788840"," Qcom coming in one, January 21st."
"8788940","8793760"," January 21st, 195c, but it's like 55 grand. "
"8794980","8797180"," People are tasting the waters right now."
"8797180","8803640"," Apple, $172.5c for $232,000."
"8809130","8810770"," I want to see what you guys think about the market. "
"8811830","8812950"," You guys want to see Roblox?"
"8814490","8815530"," I'll show you Roblox."
"8816390","8816830"," I got you."
"8822690","8823070"," RBLX. "
"8825370","8826830"," I got you guys out there."
"8827690","8829510"," I'll stick around for the next little bit here."
"8829590","8830970"," I'm just going to do tickers you guys want. "
"8832230","8833710"," I'm not going to wear it."
"8837090","8837510"," XLNX."
"8837730","8838690"," I'll check that one out next. "
"8845090","8846370"," Willie's flat on MES."
"8848410","8850410"," I'll check out Roblox right now for you, brother."
"8850650","8850890"," I missed that. "
"8851050","8853310"," I missed that shout out."
"8867460","8872160"," Saying that the buyers saved NDX at this point."
"8874060","8877120"," Yeah, we're going down more today in Vasqua. "
"8879120","8879960"," We're not done."
"8881280","8882260"," Market is soft."
"8886780","8887640"," Market's not strong. "
"8887860","8889160"," That wasn't the bounce we were looking for."
"8889300","8889920"," I can promise you."
"8891780","8894160"," PLTR, I'll do that one next after Roblox. "
"8900650","8904290"," Captain Ron, is that really PL and P-A-T-R-A?"
"8908290","8909830"," Yeah, I like XPI still."
"8910610","8911950"," I'm still a fan of XPI."
"8911950","8913110"," I got nothing against XPI. "
"8915430","8917330"," I think that trade's still on."
"8924670","8925710"," Scale a little bit."
"8925910","8927270"," Yeah, you get finding some support here. "
"8928270","8928750"," 8761."
"8931350","8933690"," You want to have tight stops here, okay?"
"8934010","8936210"," So your tight stops would be 8565."
"8936530","8937570"," You break through 8565. "
"8937990","8940810"," It's selling the news down to 80 bucks on Roblox."
"8943390","8949850"," PL and P-T-R-P-L."
"8956760","8958540"," Planet Labs, okay. "
"8963660","8967820"," XPI just had calls come in, $300,000, February 18th."
"8969840","8970940"," It might be going up here."
"8971820","8975140"," In all honesty, that could have just been hedges. "
"8979030","8983970"," That could have just been hedges and then wanting to buy the dip or they wanted to buy the dip"
"8983970","8984670"," for us to go up."
"8985550","8987210"," I'm not really anti right now."
"8987210","8988550"," I was going up from here on this buy. "
"8990550","8992330"," Even if the market is soft right now."
"9000320","9003500"," I probably should have bought a call spread down there at 468, too."
"9004620","9005320"," And I didn't. "
"9007600","9010860"," Like a straddle and a straddle."
"9010860","9012480"," A spread straddle."
"9016280","9020800"," You guys are asking me to play penny stocks on book map. "
"9023100","9025640"," You guys are killing me, $5."
"9027020","9028520"," You're at support on PL."
"9030580","9031520"," You get one. "
"9033020","9035300"," I'm not doing two today for P-T-R-A."
"9035820","9036820"," You guys are killing me."
"9037680","9038760"," P-T-R-A. "
"9038900","9039520"," What does this one cost?"
"9040340","9042000"," You guys got me penny pumping?"
"9043880","9046440"," Penny pumping stocks on book map."
"9046860","9048080"," You guys are killing me."
"9049760","9053620"," See that bounce off that Wall Street bet stock yesterday?"
"9054440","9055880"," Sound like 1034 or something. "
"9056180","9057540"," DM or DS, whatever it's called."
"9058220","9058360"," SD."
"9063760","9066500"," Buy the dip, $9 on P-T-R-A. "
"9067140","9073600"," Sell the rip, $11.78. Roku."
"9076660","9078000"," Okay, so."
"9088120","9093300"," Roku sellers above at 473, 27. "
"9095890","9102670"," Support shaping up at 468.09. More sellers than buyers."
"9103910","9107210"," Nasty, nasty negative hero on this."
"9109450","9111630"," Like, straight nasty on Roku. "
"9115250","9117030"," I don't want to say to you on Roku either."
"9117230","9117910"," You want to do what the truth?"
"9118810","9119390"," We're going down."
"9119750","9121650"," Or it looks like it right now. "
"9121750","9123130"," You really want to see some real calls."
"9124270","9126530"," This is not healthy for Roku."
"9127590","9129010"," Do I think that you pull a plug on it?"
"9129190","9129590"," I don't know. "
"9130250","9133930"," I would say to you, if you're going to take the risk on and say, fuck you, we're going up"
"9133930","9136850"," higher, then just put some protection on."
"9137790","9138510"," That's the spy."
"9139450","9140890"," Yeah, I think the spy's going down. "
"9141190","9142290"," The spy's going down, man."
"9143890","9145070"," I don't care what anybody says."
"9149800","9151000"," Well, I'm wrong about Roku. "
"9152080","9152860"," You guys are right about Roku."
"9153640","9154360"," Roku, great."
"9154540","9159160"," Support down below 175.45. You are correct. "
"9159440","9159700"," You bounced."
"9160460","9160900"," Good job, Roku."
"9161300","9164080"," I trust Roku more than I trust the spy right now. "
"9166060","9166500"," Hilarious."
"9167200","9168180"," I like this trade."
"9168940","9169600"," Called out Roku. "
"9170480","9170800"," George."
"9171500","9171600"," Okay."
"9171980","9172300"," Good job. "
"9173880","9176680"," I like Roku more than I like spy right now."
"9177680","9178760"," I like this a lot."
"9179600","9180560"," It's a nice trade. "
"9182460","9183780"," It's a great trade, by the way."
"9183840","9184440"," It might take this trade."
"9186320","9187780"," Matter of fact, I'm going to take this trade. "
"9188660","9194760"," Oh, man."
"9194900","9195400"," I like that trade."
"9195580","9196260"," A fuck ton. "
"9201960","9206680"," Hey, George, let me take a look for you a little bit lower here and see if there's anything that"
"9206680","9207720"," we can't see, okay?"
"9209020","9210280"," This could be a good trade, brother."
"9215120","9215480"," Okay."
"9215620","9217200"," So you have another support at 170. "
"9218860","9221560"," So you're going to ask yourself, we're at 173 right now?"
"9222060","9222120"," 178."
"9224340","9225400"," It's a tough one, bro."
"9226440","9229900"," You know what I would say to you is put a call spread on it right here?"
"9230240","9230740"," Like in the money. "
"9231680","9234300"," Like right here, right where we're at, 178, put a call spread on it."
"9235060","9237120"," You could make the call spread like 170."
"9239900","9242120"," And then you just have tight stops below 169. "
"9243020","9243960"," This is actually a good trade."
"9244200","9245340"," I like this better than the spy trade."
"9246180","9246960"," I like this a lot. "
"9248960","9249880"," I like this."
"9250040","9250140"," Sorry."
"9250320","9250780"," Tap my mic. "
"9252520","9253940"," I like this trade a lot."
"9258570","9263690"," You've got slightly more sellers than buyers, but it's not that bad."
"9264070","9266630"," And your hero is negative, but it's not that bad. "
"9267630","9272750"," Find out when their ER is put a call spread that's in the money after their ER, like a week"
"9272750","9274970"," or two, and they would probably print nicely."
"9275390","9276090"," I like this trade a lot."
"9277250","9278130"," Good job, George. "
"9281530","9282470"," I like the Roku trade."
"9283210","9284270"," And you know what I also like about the Roku?"
"9284270","9289150"," Well, the only thing I don't like about the Roku trade is let's say they buy Viacom."
"9289810","9291770"," Viacom will go through the roof and Roku will dump. "
"9295110","9296430"," Greetings from Greece, George."
"9297190","9297750"," Good job, brother."
"9298350","9301410"," George, I want to give you one just one note, OK?"
"9303510","9308070"," Angie, any guys that are interested in Roku, I want to give you guys one word of warning, OK?"
"9308730","9318710"," There is some expectation this year that there will be mergers amongst legacy TV companies"
"9319650","9326770"," that have books of programming, right?"
"9327270","9328810"," They have movies they've made in the past. "
"9329050","9330770"," They have TV shows like Viacom, right?"
"9331330","9332650"," They have a lot of movies they've made."
"9332870","9334370"," They have a ton of TV shows they've made."
"9334370","9337210"," And you get companies like Roku that want to grow. "
"9338290","9344290"," The only negative I can see about Roku is if in this year they say, hey, we bought Viacom."
"9344630","9346030"," You're going to see Viacom rip."
"9346510","9349770"," You're going to see Roku just burn, like straight burn. "
"9350870","9356070"," So I might say to you that you should start researching companies that look like they're going to"
"9356070","9357150"," be sold off this year."
"9358890","9363490"," Think about the ones that are going to get absorbed and maybe invest in those companies."
"9364450","9366950"," Rather than the companies that might buy them. "
"9368210","9373270"," You're looking at a transition where Roku is trying to grow, Netflix, Disney."
"9373610","9375190"," Disney is trying to do their own in-house programming."
"9375590","9379750"," But you're going to see some of these companies want to absorb classic TV. "
"9382520","9387360"," So I might be hesitant to taking along on Roku and maybe logging like Viacom."
"9390420","9393320"," But other than that, their chart looks great."
"9406970","9408370"," So that's the only thing in Stadia. "
"9412820","9419360"," Is that the Roku trade looks great on paper, but the Viacom trade is probably the better trade."
"9420180","9422580"," And let's see where Viacom is at right now."
"9424140","9427080"," 470 is the, I think it was not 470. "
"9428280","9431820"," 170 is the, looks like the bottom of Roku."
"9433360","9435900"," So let's look at Viacom real quick."
"9441830","9443530"," Like Viacom is ripping right now. "
"9443570","9444470"," It's at 35 bucks."
"9445130","9449310"," But if Viacom ever trades back down to like $29, take that trade."
"9449870","9454790"," Just buy stock or buy like 10 cents outside the money calls, expiring every three months. "
"9455350","9459350"," And just keep buying them, keep buying them, keep buying them until it's announced that someone"
"9459350","9460170"," bought the company."
"9462530","9468850"," And that's probably the, it's probably the more, probably the, the trade that's going to print fat."
"9475100","9476120"," Can I look at who?"
"9476660","9477440"," I mean, I got to go back. "
"9481730","9482810"," That's interesting too."
"9483150","9486130"," If Comcast were to absorb the Roku, that would be a big move too."
"9487290","9496690"," So Roku would would, if that's the truth, if that's really rumored, then, what would I say?"
"9500190","9504630"," Yeah, Roku would rip at that point if they got bought by Comcast or absorbed by Comcast. "
"9505370","9507570"," I don't know that Roku would do that though."
"9507770","9515610"," Maybe Tesla fighting for $1,100 bottom on Netflix trading there."
"9515670","9518290"," June, I keep saying I'll do Netflix for you guys and I haven't. "
"9519450","9521290"," Oh yeah, I'm not letting go of my puts."
"9521830","9523790"," I've got credit call spreads."
"9524750","9526850"," So none of these moves mean anything to me. "
"9528450","9529450"," They don't mean nothing."
"9530290","9536070"," If you guys look on Twitter, you can see how my structure is."
"9537390","9541710"," So my structure on my puts, NFLX. "
"9542190","9548930"," So the way that my puts are structured, we could go to like 482."
"9549950","9552890"," We could tag 482."
"9554210","9555910"," And I'll still print. "
"9556630","9558270"," I'll print 100%."
"9563410","9568370"," My calls are my bearish position is doing very well right now."
"9569210","9575870"," So all I'm concerned about is time passing and that we're not above 482. "
"9576210","9577130"," What is it for?"
"9577310","9577970"," I don't know what it is."
"9578690","9585570"," I think I've got those 476 or 478 by January 26th."
"9587430","9591010"," So do I think we're going to be above 478?"
"9593190","9596990"," The day before FOMC and I doubt it. "
"9600170","9601250"," I doubt it."
"9603440","9605720"," Thank you, Lucas, for the tip."
"9606780","9608440"," I appreciate your support. "
"9614450","9621980"," My take on spy short term is that you have to look at it from this perspective."
"9622300","9623600"," Why don't you guys understand some?"
"9624100","9625460"," There's like two ways this happens."
"9627350","9628460"," Or three ways. "
"9628760","9630020"," I'm going to give you all three versions."
"9631780","9632980"," Hedges were put on."
"9633440","9639700"," We quickly sold down and then these banks are longing the market for ER. "
"9640580","9642360"," That's version number one."
"9643360","9644700"," Version number two."
"9645100","9648260"," So you'd like, you'd want to see a lot of calls following those hedges. "
"9648800","9658900"," Version number two, they hedged the market and we've destroyed so many calls at this point that"
"9658900","9668600"," we're now waiting for these bag holding bulls to at least sell out of their positions which"
"9668600","9670580"," they're more than likely starting to do right now."
"9671780","9676540"," You know that there's a bull right now out there that's like we just traded back up to 471."
"9676720","9677820"," I'm just going to cut my losses. "
"9678660","9679620"," That's what they're going to do."
"9679920","9682160"," So now you're seeing calls roll off the market."
"9682680","9685300"," Meanwhile, in the background, you've got put buyers rolling in. "
"9685920","9689580"," And the effect is that we continue to sell down at least into close."
"9690060","9691060"," Now today, right?"
"9691740","9693700"," So then let's look at the next point, right?"
"9694360","9695640"," It's today as Wednesday, Opex."
"9696220","9698540"," So you've got Thursday and Friday. "
"9698540","9701240"," Where do we go from now until Thursday and Friday, right?"
"9701540","9702880"," Kind of shakes everything up."
"9705290","9712450"," And then your next thing you have to think about is if you're still bullish, we'll see that option"
"9712450","9721050"," four would be when we sell the market down and we immediately come straight back up."
"9721690","9725990"," We're not in that situation because what you would have seen would be like heavy selling for like"
"9725990","9729750"," 15 minutes and then an immediate rip back up to where we started. "
"9730270","9734630"," We have those moments happen every three months or so in the market and people will panic sell."
"9735250","9736470"," And it's like a fishing expedition."
"9736910","9738130"," Forex traders know about this. "
"9738750","9740210"," But this doesn't look like that."
"9742730","9743870"," So you can trade."
"9743910","9749170"," You can day trade the rips and sell or you can buy the dips. "
"9749750","9750490"," Sell the rips."
"9751530","9754370"," But until all these call buyers are washed out."
"9754370","9755910"," Because I can tell you right now. "
"9755970","9759830"," I know if one of you guys out here are listening right now and if one of you guys were"
"9759830","9768010"," just naked in calls at 47320, tell me right now that you're not going to try to sell out of"
"9768010","9772590"," your calls right where we just were at 471, 88, 48."
"9773010","9773750"," I know the psychology."
"9774330","9775950"," I got the psychology books right over here. "
"9776430","9777330"," I got one for you."
"9777330","9777870"," I'll show it to you."
"9815730","9817970"," I don't know where that book is. "
"9818170","9819270"," My daughter took it from me."
"9820370","9823050"," But I've got a book about how people act, right?"
"9824690","9830750"," So anyways, in this book that I have, it talks about how someone out there will say to you, oh"
"9830750","9831370"," no, I'm long."
"9832230","9839690"," In reality, their calls are dead and they're just they're just hoping that we get to a point where"
"9839690","9841010"," they can sell out of their calls. "
"9842810","9845590"," It's just like market psychology thing that goes on out there."
"9855770","9857190"," So you'll see bulls panic."
"9858290","9865630"," And then you'll have another set of bulls that won't sell right here, will sell down again and"
"9865630","9866390"," they'll panic sell. "
"9866770","9868110"," And that's where you seek capitulation."
"9871450","9873630"," That's what I think is going to happen in the close today."
"9873630","9883630"," So if you wanted to go long again, if you're feeling bullish, the real trade is probably end"
"9883630","9886870"," of day, right at the bell, if I had to guess. "
"9888650","9891530"," If you're bullish, I'm bullish still the market."
"9891930","9894730"," But I'm not going to go long here until end of day."
"9896230","9898210"," I want to see what happens into the close. "
"9901470","9905450"," Yes, there's Josh sold my last few spy calls for break even."
"9908530","9912090"," Yeah, VICOM is the best media play this year period and a story."
"9913490","9915410"," You got a Dixie dump going on right now. "
"9915610","9916330"," That's good to see."
"9919550","9920730"," Yeah, I can look at Baba."
"9923030","9924770"," I'll bring up Netflix real quick for you guys. "
"9927470","9930110"," Anyone out there that tells you to, I saw, I read it."
"9933250","9933930"," I did."
"9934170","9935550"," Yeah, people make a long here. "
"9936030","9937490"," There are going to be people that go long here."
"9938690","9944430"," I read a story or watched a video yesterday from CNBC saying that these guys were saying that"
"9944430","9945150"," everything's okay."
"9945630","9947670"," You can go long for ER season. "
"9950160","9951280"," That's just not the case."
"9951360","9959120"," I've traded many, many ER seasons where just technically the charts were going to sell off just"
"9959120","9962260"," because of technicals, like where we were in the chart."
"9963180","9964580"," We were going to sell off and we did. "
"9964980","9966120"," And we had great ER season."
"9966780","9968760"," We had great guidance for the next ER season."
"9968960","9972780"," But technically that year in that ER season, we were ready to sell off. "
"9975850","9979890"," You've got some nice support here on Netflix where we are at 535."
"9981050","9981790"," Consolidation, right?"
"9982930","9987230"," You've got real support down below the smart money is at 501 on Netflix."
"9997280","10001220"," Yeah, over trading is the traders worst nightmare. "
"10003820","10009180"," Yeah, and I commented on that on Twitter yesterday because I was a little pissy at CNBC."
"10012300","10015820"," Oh, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've studied Wyckoff."
"10017420","10020700"," I don't prescribe to any trading system. "
"10021840","10024580"," I don't, I can't subscribe to Wyckoff."
"10024580","10028480"," I can't subscribe to, I mean, you'll see, you don't want to see real Wyckoff then?"
"10028780","10029660"," I see it in Bitcoin."
"10031500","10035880"," I see it in Bitcoin because Bitcoin doesn't trade to anything in my book. "
"10036580","10038400"," Like, no, it doesn't trade to the spy."
"10038620","10038960"," I'm sorry."
"10040380","10042000"," No, it doesn't correlate to spy. "
"10043660","10047900"," So traders are applying Wyckoff principles to Bitcoin, which is bizarre."
"10049000","10052220"," But it makes sense because people apply Wyckoff principles to the market."
"10053480","10055040"," There's some credence to it. "
"10055380","10059940"," Like I look at it as, it's like a third or fourth layer for me to look at Wyckoff patterns"
"10059940","10062160"," because I know some traders trade to that pattern."
"10062740","10064360"," Same thing goes for Elliott Wave."
"10065240","10067580"," I know that traders trade based on Elliott Wave. "
"10068200","10070900"," So they'll trade based on their expectations in Elliott Wave."
"10071720","10077480"," But for me, it's all about price, time, real buyers, real sellers."
"10078040","10079020"," Where is the real money at?"
"10080920","10083280"," We saw that example take place this morning, right?"
"10084180","10086920"," I started talking to you guys about that this morning, right?"
"10087080","10088100"," Where's the real trade at?"
"10088480","10091900"," We tapped out at 473, 20 this morning. "
"10092300","10095620"," And no matter what, anybody else is out there telling you, I'm out here telling you, Hey, look,"
"10096040","10097440"," this is really what's going to happen."
"10099760","10101380"," And that's what happened, right?"
"10101780","10106040"," So I talked about this yesterday in yesterday's video, how I structure everything, right?"
"10106040","10110940"," Do traditional, traditional candlestick charting, traditional old school charting."
"10111340","10113380"," Then I layer that with volume profile, market profile. "
"10114220","10117680"," Then I layer that with volatility and gamma."
"10118840","10123860"," And then I layer that with market news and sentiment and also stuff."
"10124120","10126680"," And then I layer it with book map during the day, right?"
"10126840","10132100"," So I have to do all this due diligence and all these layers to get to where we are in"
"10132100","10132680"," the trading day. "
"10136680","10140020"," So that I keep my money that you guys keep your money."
"10140460","10143100"," They protect your wealth, right?"
"10143220","10143960"," We grow your wealth."
"10146060","10149580"," So the spy still has looks like some sellers have disappeared above. "
"10149940","10151600"," This is a good to see right here."
"10151660","10156860"," If you're a bull, it's good to see these sellers have disappeared above at 473, 41."
"10157600","10159600"," So on the spy, that's a good sign. "
"10163480","10168480"," Buyers are starting to step in here, but you still have real negative hero indicator down here."
"10169800","10175140"," The sellers might be have swooped down now and are attacking here at the VWAP."
"10176880","10177920"," Not a safe place. "
"10178820","10183260"," I'm not ready to log in the spy right now at all."
"10186950","10188710"," Joe Donut hit the nail right in the head."
"10191870","10193790"," Yeah, Jason knows all about this. "
"10194210","10195430"," Costco trading, baby."
"10196270","10199030"," Buy it wholesale and sell it retail because I know."
"10199590","10201910"," I know for a fact that these bulls are going to get. "
"10201910","10204230"," I know that these bulls that bought, you know, it's just like a bear."
"10204390","10206090"," You guys, if you guys don't time your trades, right?"
"10209760","10211100"," Here you go in Nvidia."
"10213280","10214420"," 276 major support. "
"10215160","10220480"," You got in a bounce right now on 279, but you got more, or you got more buyers than sellers"
"10220480","10220900"," here."
"10221940","10223100"," Nvidia might be due for a pop."
"10224900","10227260"," But I want to be buying calls cheap, right?"
"10227980","10229300"," I don't want to be buying calls expensive. "
"10230600","10231980"," How do we buying your bags?"
"10233280","10234820"," I want to buy your capitulation."
"10237160","10242540"," Now, 284, 289, 298 on Nvidia."
"10243160","10251050"," I think we all know that kind of maybe some intraday support here where we are. "
"10252330","10258490"," And I would suspect if we don't get a bid, you're getting a bid right now on Nvidia."
"10258490","10261010"," But if you don't get a bid, expect us to sell down to 275."
"10263850","10266970"," I'm not ready to enter anything right now in this market. "
"10267570","10269850"," I see too much grinding, right?"
"10270070","10272310"," And the options chain, you guys can look at the options chain."
"10272890","10278950"," Or you guys should study the options chain right now so that you can tell when you actually take"
"10278950","10279790"," along or short."
"10279790","10287150"," I know when it, sometimes you guys will say, hey, my calls are, we're going up and my calls are"
"10287150","10287830"," not going up. "
"10288090","10290550"," Or we're going down and my calls are going up."
"10291070","10293570"," So you can see when is actually the best time to buy."
"10293830","10299470"," And so if the here indicator is not healthy on the spy right now, not healthy at all. "
"10304800","10305480"," Not healthy."
"10305640","10306980"," I have a hard time buying the spy right here."
"10309420","10310960"," I don't need to make a trade every day. "
"10317560","10319460"," But Costco makes their memberships."
"10320320","10326800"," I think Jason was making a soliloquy breakdown."
"10327060","10329480"," I mean, bro, you're a boomer. "
"10329820","10331440"," Yeah, I'm a bull."
"10331620","10332440"," Just so you guys know."
"10334640","10342520"," The sellers are gone at 4.73, but it looks like they're right on 4.70. Looks like the sellers"
"10342520","10345800"," swoop down from 4.73 and they're sitting right on top. "
"10345960","10346560"," You can see it here."
"10347120","10347840"," You guys want to see."
"10348660","10350300"," There's some supply above here. "
"10350540","10354480"," 4.71 is a nice thick red beam up here of sellers."
"10355440","10356780"," They're going to try to sell this down."
"10357100","10357780"," They might not win. "
"10358300","10362320"," There are some buyer stepping in as well down below at 4.70. A little battle going on."
"10363640","10365000"," So I'll leave the spy up for you guys."
"10365080","10365580"," I'm going to take a lunch. "
"10365760","10366180"," I got to take a break."
"10366180","10367180"," I'm going to take a potty."
"10367500","10368280"," Go potty break. "
"10369060","10370320"," I'm going to go Tinkles."
"10376680","10380600"," Yeah, as Lou, I'll do BCRX for you real quick."
"10381840","10382560"," What's BCRX?"
"10383820","10385300"," I don't think I've ever traded this. "
"10390730","10391970"," I'll throw that one up for you."
"10392110","10393410"," I've never seen you post before."
"10393410","10395230"," So I got you covered, bro. "
"10397730","10399670"," It's tough too for this to work."
"10400250","10404130"," This program doesn't do so well on..."
"10405170","10406310"," This isn't good."
"10407610","10409290"," We got more buyers and sellers here. "
"10410190","10412610"," We got some heavy resistance above it, 1791."
"10413750","10414870"," Heavy resistance at 1978."
"10416230","10417630"," Heavy resistance at 2499. "
"10419970","10422230"," This below here is not safe."
"10422230","10423730"," I want you to know that."
"10424830","10431390"," If your buyers disappear here at any point, let's say that you get a rug pull, you can fall"
"10431390","10431790"," heavily. "
"10432630","10433510"," Be conscious of that."
"10434230","10437910"," If you want to take it north, if you're bullish on it, take it to 1789."
"10438730","10440710"," You do have more buyers and sellers slightly more. "
"10441470","10442350"," It's like even Steven."
"10443310","10446470"," But if at any point bad news comes, this will sell."
"10454140","10455300"," I'm just going to take a break, guys. "
"10455300","10456640"," I got to go to the bathroom."
"10466950","10467430"," Right on."
"10467750","10468470"," Good job, Paul. "
"10468850","10470130"," Way to save it, Paul."
"10478420","10479720"," Yeah, BCRX is..."
"10479720","10484580"," There's more buyers and sellers, but there's no wall below, right?"
"10484740","10489020"," There's no support where a bank's saying, hey, I'll buy you right at 10 bucks, no matter what"
"10489020","10489620"," retail does."
"10492780","10493960"," So Roku's up, right?"
"10494160","10496280"," Yeah, on a small time frame, Roku looks great. "
"10496920","10497640"," It's on local support."
"10498740","10505820"," The only thing you want to be scared of is if there's any news saying that they're going to buy"
"10505820","10507200"," a company, it won't be good."
"10509720","10510980"," Invest was bringing up. "
"10511040","10511680"," You're welcome, Zulu."
"10512680","10515360"," Invest was bringing up BMY as a possible short candidate."
"10517200","10518640"," Yeah, please like and subscribe. "
"10519240","10524880"," If I saved your accounts at all today or made you any money today or yesterday, I gave you guys"
"10524880","10526440"," fair warning on that drop today."
"10526800","10529360"," Like, subscribe if you're a poor trader, a new trader."
"10530020","10533820"," If you made money today, please support the channel with anything you can. "
"10534160","10538180"," It helps me to pay for these services, the time that I put into this for you guys every day."
"10538880","10540300"," You guys saw it this morning, right?"
"10540700","10545680"," So I'm here prepared for you, letting you know where the danger is live."
"10546560","10547700"," The upside too, right?"
"10548260","10552160"," So we catch the butt, we catch the upside, we catch the downside together. "
"10553560","10560240"," I don't know how many subscription services out there that are free or paid that'll give you a"
"10560240","10561960"," warning before anyone else in the market."
"10561960","10563120"," I don't know many."
"10563740","10565700"," I don't know many traders that know that either. "
"10566100","10566720"," A few."
"10567620","10568300"," Very few."
"10575230","10577010"," Thanks Chas for the shout out, brother. "
"10582280","10584060"," Some of you guys know what's up out there."
"10584460","10590140"," I know some of you guys have paid for subscription services and I know they don't do, because I've"
"10590140","10590800"," paid for them all."
"10591160","10597500"," That's how I got here is I paid for every subscription service out there and I was pissed off that"
"10597500","10601080"," I couldn't get actionable trades or intelligence. "
"10602320","10606860"," I always get like a video or a stop-in for one trade, but I never had a guy there"
"10606860","10610700"," just saying, hey, you know, watch out at this moment."
"10611260","10612880"," We're in a real high-risk situation here."
"10613320","10616020"," Or hey, they have a chance of gapping up at this point, right?"
"10616540","10618480"," Keep pivot points in the market. "
"10620280","10622040"," So we're going to look at BMY next."
"10625150","10626410"," We're going to come back to the spy."
"10626530","10628070"," I want to show you something to the spy here, okay?"
"10628910","10629630"," Just a minute. "
"10632570","10633630"," It's like a BMY."
"10634090","10635450"," Yeah, BMY is a nice candidate."
"10635850","10636710"," It's another one right here. "
"10636870","10638110"," It's a great candidate for a short."
"10639070","10641330"," You got more buyers than sellers here, right?"
"10641710","10645130"," But you would take a short on this at $66 all day long."
"10646670","10648570"," Take a short at $66 to $70. "
"10649050","10650530"," It's got nothing below it."
"10650910","10651830"," It's clear skies below."
"10651830","10655610"," Here's some ice below it, $60, but that's not real support. "
"10657850","10658470"," Excuse me."
"10663940","10667480"," You can see the buyers are down below here at $468 on the spy."
"10668280","10669360"," It's got good support there. "
"10669480","10669960"," That's good to see."
"10670260","10670840"," I like seeing this."
"10671360","10672620"," This is building on the spy. "
"10675200","10683020"," I'll probably be looking for some form of capitulation by bulls, and then I will enter the trade as"
"10683020","10683240"," a bull."
"10686990","10688630"," Cody, I appreciate the tip."
"10689910","10693550"," My wife is accumulating everybody on PayPal. "
"10693670","10697470"," That's tipped so that I can give shout outs to you guys at the end of this week."
"10698350","10700650"," And Cody, if you tipped a buck, I appreciate it."
"10700790","10703170"," If you're too poor to tip me, don't tip me anything, bro. "
"10703650","10704710"," Just like and subscribe."
"10709750","10712310"," Joel Botts by puts it behind this morning."
"10713450","10713890"," Nice. "
"10716010","10716830"," Yeah, I like Roku."
"10717250","10718790"," I can't say that I don't like Roku here."
"10718790","10724030"," My only thing to say about Roku is you can take the..."
"10724030","10726610"," Roku is at a spot where you take the long. "
"10727910","10729570"," What do you do, though, in that long?"
"10730110","10737490"," If you want to set a news alert, if you hear any breathe, breath, of Roku buying something, that's"
"10737490","10738250"," going to trigger a sell."
"10738710","10740690"," Outside of that, you're good to go right here."
"10741110","10744070"," Anywhere from $179, or is it $179 out of $170?"
"10744950","10746610"," Wherever that mark was in that ticker. "
"10747790","10749370"," Anywhere from $171, $179."
"10749930","10750810"," Throw some call spreads on."
"10750930","10751330"," You're good to go. "
"10754740","10757500"," If you see Roku, you might want to get out of your Roku calls right now."
"10758060","10762460"," That was a good little run, but I'd buy some calls at $170 on Roku all day long."
"10766040","10766800"," I'm going to take a break. "
"10766940","10768600"," I'm going to leave this up for you this morning."
"10769640","10770500"," Well, I take a break."
"10771380","10777160"," I'll leave this buy up for you so you can see where the buy, the dip is here. "
"10777940","10779440"," Well, you guys, see this here."
"10780000","10782500"," You can see that some of it is disappearing down here."
"10782580","10783500"," See this support?"
"10784260","10784840"," It's dipping. "
"10788220","10788700"," Okay."
"10789440","10790520"," I'll check back on you guys."
"10793340","10794300"," Zach Burton. "
"10795580","10796520"," Thank you very much."
"10798280","10802700"," Zach Burton slapped that Donate button, you dirty dog."
"10803600","10804620"," Winky face. "
"10805180","10807980"," Slap that subscribe button, you dirty dog."
"10810260","10812460"," Thank you very much for the support, bros."
"10815560","10817000"," Yeah, congrats, Jill. "
"10819780","10821020"," Yeah, I like trading."
"10821240","10826900"," I traded SE for a year."
"10827540","10832000"," That stock used to trade like a printer. "
"10833660","10836720"," That stock traded one channel for like a year and a half."
"10837240","10839340"," SE is a banger if you don't know how to trade it."
"10841440","10842260"," Oh, here we go. "
"10842320","10843100"," We're printing puts again."
"10844160","10845580"," Make it go burn to the clothes."
"10845880","10847180"," Give me some capitulation bulls. "
"10852680","10856060"," You guys can just look up an economic calendar and a Google search."
"10857560","10862100"," There are economic calendars that give you the main ones, and then there's some economic calendars"
"10862100","10865700"," out there that give you detailed around the world economic calendars."
"10866560","10872380"," I think the market, I think Mark are investing.com is pretty simple and basic and straightforward,"
"10872860","10874780"," and market watches is very in depth. "
"10881480","10885860"," All right, I'll check back in and just a bit of cowboy bros like bras."
"10886300","10887100"," I don't know what to say."
"10888320","10890280"," Because I know those females listening in here too. "
"10892700","10894920"," Yeah, SE is a great, a great printer."
"10894920","10901040"," There's got to be like a Chinese sweatshop or boiler room that trades that are some."
"10901240","10903400"," There's something in China trading that stock. "
"10907750","10908870"," Oh yeah, hutch."
"10910610","10911630"," Capitulation, bro."
"10913710","10914230"," Capitulation. "
"10916530","10917730"," Stock market psychology."
"10923100","10924100"," All right, I'll be back."
"10925180","10925700"," Take a lunch. "
"10945840","10946920"," Oh yeah, you're right."
"10947040","10947500"," It's not China."
"10947500","10948320"," It's Singapore. "
"10949860","10951160"," You're totally right."
"10951660","10952300"," It's sorry."
"10952460","10954280"," I forgot all about that. "
"10954440","10954880"," And then you're right."
"10954960","10955760"," It is national pride."
"10956480","10957820"," I totally forgot all about that. "
"11035130","11035610"," Rearray."
"11035990","11036850"," Thank you for the tip."
"14392220","14393640"," All right, I'm back from lunch. "
"14393680","14394320"," Had some burgers."
"14394900","14397760"," We have nice little snapback, which is good to see."
"14398980","14399820"," Only issue. "
"14400040","14402900"," Hopefully if any of you guys played the snapback on Tesla."
"14403960","14410080"," The calls that were going to 1100 at the open this morning are not the same price as Tesla calls"
"14410080","14411480"," to 1100 R right now, right?"
"14412100","14413340"," You'd really need to go up another."
"14415100","14418540"," You need to go up more to break even at this point, I would think. "
"14418940","14419740"," So we'll take a look at Tesla."
"14420780","14422100"," See if we're going to trade higher."
"14428510","14434170"," A little Tesla, but no Tesla bulls are probably wondering if we're going to sell off here or"
"14434170","14435270"," continue to trade up. "
"14444190","14446670"," It's going to take just a minute for it to load up."
"14455960","14469200"," I don't"
"14469200","14470880"," know why Tesla's loading up here."
"14477800","14478780"," That should work better. "
"14491680","14493480"," Try to help out Tesla gang here."
"14498280","14500300"," This is nice to see right here."
"14508000","14509300"," Just a minute here. "
"14512140","14517380"," See if we can see if the sellers are moving up a little bit on Tesla here."
"14520780","14523480"," You've got a great hero indicator on Tesla."
"14524440","14529140"," You've got way more buyers than sellers here on Tesla. "
"14529140","14534360"," We're at $10.99. Let me on paper or on the chart, it looks like it's going to sell off"
"14534360","14534940"," button reality."
"14535900","14537180"," It's not looking that bad."
"14538320","14547720"," $11.05, $11.10. Smart money's down here at $10.80. We'll take a look and see if there's any"
"14547720","14549380"," expectation of us trading much higher. "
"14558050","14561090"," I think this morning we had $11.50 on the chart."
"14561990","14562610"," I remember correctly."
"14564710","14566290"," We had a wall above. "
"14566830","14571570"," See if we can bring it up there and just see if that wall is still there."
"14571750","14573750"," This wall is still here."
"14574570","14576970"," $11.50 is maintained, which is nice to see. "
"14579430","14584250"," Let's see if we can see above $11.50 and see if there's any other real wall of sellers above"
"14584250","14584490"," it."
"14584650","14585230"," Maybe at $1,200."
"14586810","14587670"," There it is right there. "
"14588370","14590090"," This would be the expectation."
"14590650","14600470"," The call wall is probably at $11.93.36. Right here you have some light resistance"
"14600470","14604850"," at $11.50. That would be the expectation that we go that high."
"14606130","14608030"," I don't know if there's more sellers above that. "
"14608150","14610110"," We could check if you really wanted to."
"14622610","14625330"," This is what you are live right now."
"14625330","14634230"," I've got some resistance above here at $11.03. You've got $11.08. I measured a move this morning"
"14634230","14641550"," on a traditional chart to $11.38. Then we checked the book map this morning. "
"14641870","14645630"," You're going to call this R1."
"14645950","14646970"," This is R1."
"14647170","14651330"," Resistance 1 is $11.05 to $11.10 or so. "
"14651930","14654230"," If you're still bullish here where we are on Tesla."
"14654230","14655850"," You take your winnings here."
"14656190","14662650"," You wait until we trade above $11.10.91. You'd want to find support above here. "
"14663370","14669850"," Then you take another long trade to $11.50. Then once you got to $11.50 you would get out"
"14669850","14670530"," of that trade."
"14671410","14673210"," You would take it to $1,200."
"14674830","14676270"," We can look higher above. "
"14678090","14681310"," When I take trades on anything in the stock market, I take it towards."
"14682210","14685170"," Let the banks do the work over."
"14686430","14689010"," Here's a prime example right here. "
"14690690","14694010"," Let's say we're trading up on Tesla at $1,200."
"14694790","14697050"," You don't want to be in the middle."
"14697310","14698010"," Not the middly. "
"14698090","14700550"," Not the diddle in the middle that you hear, Mr. You hadn't talked about."
"14700970","14704650"," Even when you come to support a resistance, you don't want to be diddle in here either."
"14705070","14707650"," You want to be diddle in here as we're going somewhere. "
"14707650","14711250"," Once you get in here, your options get ground up."
"14711450","14713270"," It doesn't matter if they're weeklies or monthlies."
"14714490","14717070"," We're going to look a little bit higher here and see if there's any more sellers. "
"14718210","14719010"," There shouldn't be."
"14719290","14720290"," $12.40 I think."
"14721730","14731510"," $12.50. You'd call this $12.50 mark equity buyers that are still trapped above. "
"14737710","14740370"," Then you've got the price target of $1,200."
"14740370","14743750"," You want to realize that that's probably the call wall above her as well, right?"
"14743950","14745070"," $12.50 is the call wall."
"14745370","14750250"," It's hard to get to that call wall unless you see the call wall will get raised to like $1 "
"14750250","14750710",",300. "
"14750990","14753090"," You get like a ton of calls at $1,300, $1,400."
"14754010","14758010"," I haven't looked to see if any of those calls have come in yet for ER."
"14759990","14763910"," I know that any of you guys, I know for a fact unless you double down at the bottom of"
"14763910","14769650"," Tesla today that your calls are not the same price even at the ceiling here, right?"
"14769650","14774590"," If you're looking at a classic chart, the move up to $1,100 at the open and then down and"
"14774590","14777070"," then back up again, those calls are not the same price. "
"14777330","14779190"," You need to have more buyers stepping in."
"14779830","14780370"," This isn't bad."
"14783670","14787030"," $2.4,000 is a good start for Tesla. "
"14788630","14790330"," This is good hopes right here."
"14790890","14792310"," The key here would be this."
"14792450","14799010"," If you're a Tesla bull, you try to un-f yourself at $1,100, right?"
"14799010","14803670"," After taking another long, if you're bullish, you're going to wait to take another long above $1 "
"14803670","14803930",",112. "
"14806030","14809070"," You'll see some grinding and some support being made here."
"14809410","14811470"," You want to see this develop this whole area."
"14812290","14816130"," Then you would jump in and ride the lightning up to $1,150. "
"14816990","14817910"," Get out at $1,150."
"14818270","14821030"," Ride the lightning back up again to $1,200."
"14821890","14826190"," While you're doing this, you're going to be looking for call structure that's way higher than $1 "
"14826190","14826630",",200. "
"14826630","14831510"," You want to see call structure in the $1,300s, $1,350, $1,400."
"14831910","14833210"," That's how you get much higher."
"14833630","14840270"," You'll never ever see any stock squeeze higher without the call structure much higher. "
"14840990","14842910"," You need to see the expansion of calls."
"14843570","14853310"," You guys can go through bar chart and just look at just"
"14853310","14854890"," the Tesla calls for today."
"14854890","14858770"," You can get a feel for where they're plotted. "
"14859130","14864150"," I think you're going to see me as well or somewhere else, CBEO or something."
"14864350","14870570"," We'll show you the dot plot of where all the call concentrations are on Tesla."
"14870790","14878110"," But this is a good place to take your profit and then wait for a buy above or re-enter"
"14878110","14881690"," again down below at 1080 and ride it up once more to $1,100. "
"14882370","14884250"," Jump back out and take it up again."
"14884390","14886710"," Keep playing this if you're a Tesla bull."
"14888010","14890150"," Keep buying these dips and riding it up. "
"14891350","14895350"," Let the banks always do the work at support and resistance levels for you."
"14897930","14900350"," To run on subscribe from here, we're going to take a look at the spy."
"14901090","14902910"," I think the spy is in that similar situation. "
"14903410","14904590"," We did the snapback move."
"14905190","14906610"," I think that just completed itself."
"14908230","14909370"," Let's take a look at the spy. "
"14911370","14913290"," Yeah, so spy had it snapback."
"14913790","14922050"," The top of that was 471.88. So my trade was what I sold calls at the open this morning."
"14922790","14923550"," I bought some puts. "
"14924310","14925490"," I bought some put spreads."
"14926630","14927530"," I didn't close them."
"14927950","14930750"," In my view, I think we trade down still. "
"14931950","14936850"," I wanted to eat some lunch, so I didn't trade that last move, that last bounce down below."
"14937290","14939130"," I thought it was too risky for my blood."
"14939390","14942530"," I've made it too much money to want to trade the spy on that move. "
"14943390","14945490"," I can see that some of you would want to make that trade."
"14946690","14950150"," I am interested to know if any of you took that trade with options."
"14950910","14954130"," Did they get ground to dust on the way up there or did you make some money?"
"14955270","14956230"," I'm not sure what you did. "
"14956650","14961570"," My expectation though, into the close, is that we're going to see this number again."
"14961570","14968590"," You're going to see my view 471 maybe, 470 before the end of the day."
"14969230","14970350"," Possibly even lower. "
"14970890","14974650"," We could possibly do a deep sell down into the close."
"14976130","14978830"," Bulls will get super scared and that might be a nice bottom to buy."
"14980130","14981570"," We might trade up from here as well. "
"14982170","14983190"," I haven't been paying much attention."
"14983390","14986830"," I had a cheeseburger and a half a cheeseburger."
"14986830","14991980"," I shared one with my daughter for lunchtime here. "
"14992880","14996860"," There's still a mixed bag of spy calls coming in."
"14997240","15000880"," It's not really saying on one side of the other if we're going to run high from here."
"15002280","15005440"," I see some calls coming in for ticker EEM. "
"15006300","15007340"," It's Echo Echo Mike."
"15010260","15013320"," 53C expiring on February 18th."
"15013760","15015220"," Twitter has some calls coming in. "
"15015220","15017320"," VIX calls are coming in right now."
"15017400","15018920"," Some spy puts are coming in big ones."
"15019540","15021680"," You have some substantial spy puts coming in. "
"15022020","15026660"," That would be the implication is just from looking at a chart every day for the past 10 years."
"15029340","15030900"," This looks like a trade's down in the close."
"15031120","15032960"," I could be wrong, but 9x out of 10. "
"15034020","15037840"," 9x out of 10 we're going to trade down into this close."
"15039280","15044440"," Enough times that I wouldn't risk trying to buy a rip into the close."
"15044440","15048740"," I want most of my trades to always be winners. "
"15049180","15051200"," Let me know in the chat if you picked up."
"15051540","15054100"," Let me know in the chat right now if you picked up any calls."
"15054520","15059560"," Not contracts and futures where you buy an actual shares or stock. "
"15060220","15065740"," I want to know if you bought call options and actually made the money on that snapback."
"15066000","15068140"," Sometimes they grind it on the way up."
"15073860","15075120"," I see what you guys are talking about here. "
"15075880","15076720"," Let me read through your stuff."
"15077460","15078200"," Spy, please."
"15078600","15078860"," Spy, close. "
"15079160","15079980"," Then a trend on the 5."
"15080640","15081860"," VIX is starting to run up."
"15082120","15084920"," Cap, there were orders for $500,000 CNSPX."
"15085380","15089120"," Hey, thanks for that update on the $500,000 CNSPX. "
"15089360","15090220"," That's good to see."
"15092460","15093340"," June expiry."
"15093760","15094900"," Thanks for the heads up. "
"15095540","15099080"," I just bought some $470 P month expiration on the jump into the open."
"15099820","15100820"," Good job in that one."
"15102160","15104640"," Followed trend to $473 then the flag. "
"15105480","15106900"," Low is only $470 now."
"15109040","15111460"," Chase, I want you to pay attention, Chase."
"15111680","15116700"," I want you specifically to open a paper trading account on Webull right now. "
"15117700","15118760"," Forget trading cash."
"15119160","15123340"," Open a paper trading account and I'm just going to give you specific trades."
"15124200","15126080"," I want you to track those paper trades. "
"15126720","15130560"," The reason why I want you to track them is because I want you to feel like this is what"
"15130560","15135620"," a winning trade looks like so that you know when to be entering and closing so that when you're"
"15135620","15138500"," entering a trade and it doesn't feel like that, you get a feel, right?"
"15138800","15143540"," Rather than getting a feel for losers, I want you to get a feel for winners, okay?"
"15143760","15149460"," So I'll give you specific trades to take on so that you're consistently feeling like this feels"
"15149460","15153560"," right because the weird thing is that winning trades tend to not feel right."
"15154200","15155220"," They tend to feel wrong."
"15155920","15158100"," They're the opposite of whatever you're thinking in your head. "
"15162260","15163680"," And specifically for you, Chase."
"15163860","15167860"," If anybody else out there that's listening right now, if any of you guys are new traders out there,"
"15168120","15170060"," let's say you're winning like 50% of your trades."
"15170500","15176560"," If you're not winning 70% to 90% of your trades out there right now, I want you guys"
"15176560","15181160"," to open a fucking paper account and just follow some of these trades. "
"15181520","15186120"," When I say to you, don't be like questioning me or any of that kind of stuff, just say like"
"15186120","15191300"," when I say take this trade or take that trade, take that trade because I want you to understand the"
"15191300","15193380"," feeling of I'm in the right trade right now."
"15193380","15199700"," Because I know that sometimes for a long time when I was losing a lot, I got into the habit"
"15199700","15205440"," of feeling like the trade was right, but it was the wrong trade right and I was losing money and"
"15205440","15209580"," I didn't know what it felt like to be in the winning trade because once I started to learn how"
"15209580","15212340"," to do the winning trades, I felt unnatural."
"15212960","15214940"," It was like an unnatural feeling about taking that trade. "
"15215800","15217080"," It wasn't how my mind thinks."
"15217320","15220860"," It was the complete opposite of where I should be taking that trade."
"15227800","15228780"," Yeah, you guys are fine. "
"15229100","15230000"," Just paper trade it."
"15230120","15230760"," I do trust me."
"15230820","15238680"," I've lost so much F in money in this market over the years from, it's not habits. "
"15239420","15244560"," It's this weird thing where you win a bunch and then you start to lose and somehow you're like,"
"15244640","15247160"," well, you start to question yourself, you're like, wait a minute."
"15247680","15251080"," Should I just take the opposite trade every time now of whatever I'm thinking?"
"15251500","15254840"," You start to think like that and you just get all discombobulated in your head."
"15255320","15261600"," When in reality, you just need to be entering trades that work and then how is your mind thinking"
"15261600","15262480"," in that time frame?"
"15262900","15266920"," You start to remember how you're thinking at that time and then you start to understand the feeling"
"15266920","15268340"," of them in the right trade. "
"15268400","15269120"," It starts to change."
"15269320","15273060"," The brain pattern starts to change to match up to those trades."
"15275410","15277370"," And you can see down here, we've got a spy. "
"15278750","15284470"," More buyers down here at 468.03. That's a concern to me as well."
"15284470","15288150"," You know, we're talking about dip buyers down here at 470."
"15288330","15292390"," It's looking like the support is falling out on the spy over here, okay?"
"15293850","15302050"," So it's concerning here to see, I'm concerned here to see this right here. "
"15302190","15303850"," It looks like this support has gotten lower."
"15304750","15305190"," See that?"
"15306590","15308810"," 468.02. I don't like that."
"15310090","15313790"," I don't like the sellers stepping in right now on the spy. "
"15316660","15318880"," This is like a classic setup right here."
"15321460","15323920"," Look at the chart pattern for today, classic setup."
"15325220","15332360"," When we fail, right, if we fail somewhere on the spy chart, let's say we run up in the morning"
"15332360","15334420"," and we fail at some point. "
"15334980","15338520"," We hit a top or whatever and we trade down."
"15338860","15340780"," This is a classic setup for that to happen."
"15340780","15344020"," Furthermore, today is January 12th. "
"15344080","15349060"," If you go back into any other OPEX month, right around the 10th, we start trading down."
"15349740","15354960"," We trade down right into the Thursday before OPEX, which is next week, like a whole week of"
"15354960","15355140"," selling."
"15355960","15360960"," Then we rip stupid high, like 1.5% to 3% high. "
"15361140","15364320"," We'll even trade sideways possibly into this next week."
"15365500","15368960"," You know, as a matter of fact, there might be a really nice trade here."
"15368960","15375780"," If any of you guys out there that have some time in the market trading, there might be a really"
"15375780","15385580"," nice condor or fly to trade into next week possible, like from now into Friday"
"15385580","15385960"," maybe. "
"15387280","15390420"," There might be a nice trade, like thank you for playing Bulls."
"15390740","15391760"," Thank you for playing Bears."
"15392780","15397080"," We're going to burn all of your calls and puts and theta gang is going to step in. "
"15397080","15399620"," This looks like a classic theta gang setup to me."
"15401710","15403430"," If there was one, this is it."
"15405090","15414930"," Kind of bounce around between 4.73, 4.68. You can just kill murder calls and puts from"
"15414930","15415670"," now into Friday. "
"15416030","15420370"," I bet theta gang is out there looking at this right now saying they're getting greedy."
"15426960","15427660"," It is."
"15428040","15428900"," It is blood stun. "
"15428900","15430520"," I know."
"15432360","15434580"," You guys know what I'm talking about."
"15435220","15437020"," It's not that we don't trade down later. "
"15437980","15439240"," It's that just look at it."
"15439320","15441480"," Just look at today's single day chart and spine."
"15441780","15442940"," What does this remind you of?"
"15444660","15452620"," I'm going to bet you that you should go out there and watch other people's videos tonight and"
"15452620","15457140"," they're either going to tell you that we're going to trade sideways or sideways and down. "
"15462520","15465340"," Yeah, my is as time passes on put spreads."
"15465400","15466280"," That's the other thing."
"15468600","15470780"," If you're in like any kind of spread that's a put. "
"15471760","15475400"," As time passes, they just keep increasing in value."
"15475680","15478620"," I could care less where we trade as long as we don't trade above."
"15479900","15482800"," Four seven or you guys I posted the swing. "
"15482800","15486740"," You can see the swing that that's all I need for those to print."
"15487000","15488040"," They'll just sit there in the background."
"15490040","15494600"," If we don't trade above or if we trade to 482 and then swing down, I'm in the clear. "
"15495300","15496120"," We'd have to trade this."
"15496320","15498780"," We'd have to trade like 482."
"15499100","15500060"," Then we'd have to trade. "
"15500140","15502240"," We'd have to melt up from now into FMC."
"15502700","15503760"," I don't see us."
"15504360","15510960"," I don't see us going into the FMC meeting with everyone being on edge about rates and tapering. "
"15512240","15515380"," I just don't see it like we're talking this January FMC."
"15516420","15518240"," They're ramping up the taper into March."
"15518340","15519900"," They're going to be as bearishes. "
"15519980","15521100"," I mean, that's what they're going to be."
"15521940","15522660"," We know that."
"15522820","15523500"," I know that as a bull. "
"15523700","15524740"," You guys have to know that."
"15525160","15526460"," Even with the R season."
"15529420","15530680"," You guys want to buy volatility?"
"15531220","15535120"," Buy volatility into FMC. "
"15536260","15536920"," This is guaranteed."
"15537380","15538120"," You're going to get guaranteed."
"15538140","15540120"," You're going to get our volatility guaranteed. "
"15540420","15543600"," Everybody's going to be talking about tapering into FMC meeting."
"15544340","15545680"," There's just no way around it."
"15548460","15550860"," I think we do go to 500 by June. "
"15551040","15551800"," I agree with that statement."
"15552540","15555700"," Those SPX calls will probably print even if we trade down."
"15556180","15557160"," They'll print fine. "
"15558660","15564700"," But they're going to talk about some of those hedges are like dated for like mid February dated"
"15564700","15565320"," from March."
"15566380","15570920"," I dated for this whole period from now into March."
"15570920","15578920"," I know some of you guys noticed as we get closer to ERs, you'll see individual tickers move. "
"15579520","15581640"," But you'll see the indexes kind of start trading sideways."
"15583500","15584900"," They become range bound."
"15585660","15587260"," They don't participate a ton. "
"15587620","15588680"," They participate a little bit."
"15589340","15594620"," But I don't like trading the indexes often with puts and calls when we come into ER season."
"15595540","15596200"," Too dangerous. "
"15596500","15601360"," You'll see like spy trade down because of Amazon or trade up because of Amazon."
"15603120","15607280"," It's better to probably trade tickers, individual tickers into ER season."
"15608080","15609840"," And this is setting up like that right now. "
"15611300","15612640"," And so that's the next question, right?"
"15612780","15615220"," Do we come into a capitulation move into the close today?"
"15616300","15617660"," It's 1.30 in the afternoon."
"15621560","15622860"," We're trading down now."
"15623040","15623600"," We're trading sideways. "
"15625280","15629620"," Tagged 4.73. Then tagged 4.68. We're right in the middle of it."
"15629620","15631080"," Dittoed in the middle, right?"
"15631240","15632300"," Isn't that what Mr. Ian says?"
"15632780","15633820"," No, didloon in the middle?"
"15638020","15638960"," Right on, right on."
"15639120","15640020"," Yeah, Theo trades is cool. "
"15642480","15644300"," No, stop with the wake off cycle."
"15644960","15645300"," Seriously."
"15647220","15648980"," You guys talk about wake off cycles. "
"15649320","15650500"," You guys talk about..."
"15651520","15654100"," You guys talk about wake off cycles and Elliott Wave theory."
"15654880","15655740"," It looks great on paper."
"15656820","15660300"," It looks great on paper until you have to trade it. "
"15660300","15663420"," I don't believe anyone that trades it."
"15664140","15664700"," None of them."
"15665340","15668480"," I just don't believe them because I know that you lose money. "
"15669140","15669760"," I've done it."
"15670060","15671920"," I've done Elliott Wave trading."
"15672200","15673180"," I've done wake off trading. "
"15674160","15677360"," Wake off trading kind of works on Bitcoin right now, surprisingly."
"15678400","15680620"," But I think that's because it is trading on its own."
"15681100","15684660"," So people are trying to apply trading patterns to it. "
"15686080","15690000"," But there's so much randomness in unknown news for the stock market."
"15690800","15693800"," That you can't trade it to an exact science enough to win."
"15694240","15694760"," In my view. "
"15695280","15696920"," I know that a lot of people disagree with that."
"15697540","15699880"," I know that a lot of people get pissed off when I say that."
"15700020","15700300"," I understand. "
"15700780","15702320"," And I respect them getting pissed off."
"15703200","15703820"," We disagree."
"15704920","15705720"," I don't..."
"15705720","15707700"," I trade based on a lot of other..."
"15707700","15710420"," I use it as a tool, but I don't trade..."
"15710420","15711180"," Hey, I'm Elliott Wave. "
"15711320","15712140"," I trade Elliott Wave."
"15712980","15713380"," I don't."
"15714520","15717360"," I lost money trading Elliott Wave, so I can't do it. "
"15719140","15720460"," Yep, never did it in the middle."
"15723890","15725370"," Yeah, I think that we did..."
"15725370","15727190"," I think it applies well to Bitcoin."
"15728130","15736370"," I think that classic trading methodology applies very well. "
"15736530","15737830"," It's very accurate too on Bitcoin."
"15738290","15738570"," Anycoin."
"15739750","15741330"," Because you can't really base it on anything. "
"15741870","15742430"," You need a benchmark."
"15743270","15745210"," And that was the big question for a couple of years, right?"
"15745610","15747770"," How do we benchmark trade crypto?"
"15748850","15751430"," And it didn't react like anything else, right?"
"15751890","15752910"," So it's like, how do you trade it?"
"15753330","15754410"," And so what do you do?"
"15754490","15758210"," You have to apply classic trading patterns to it."
"15758210","15761010"," And it actually starts to work well for Bitcoin. "
"15762050","15767190"," I know there's a group of you out there that think that it's been matching the spy better than it"
"15767190","15768110"," ever has in the past."
"15770150","15772050"," I've seen that fail too many times."
"15773370","15775430"," So for me, it's not accurate enough. "
"15775430","15780070"," And I like to see it trading on something recognizable."
"15780990","15786210"," But if you want to see randomness in the market, any of you guys that are Elliott wave"
"15786210","15792590"," practitioners, I know you guys go back and have to say shit, we have an extension of this or, you"
"15792590","15800890"," know, I'm not trying to disparage saying, well, I had to recalculate this move afterwards or we"
"15800890","15802050"," didn't anticipate this."
"15802850","15806190"," But that's the part about the market that for me, I lose too much money. "
"15806930","15811710"," I've made too many bad trades knowing that I'm knowing that this is going to happen."
"15812570","15814190"," And I really just want the real money flow."
"15820600","15826140"," So I like, I like, yeah, no, I'll trade Elliott. "
"15826320","15829020"," I use Elliott wave, but I don't trade it."
"15829120","15833140"," I don't use it for, I don't make any decisions based on it."
"15833520","15835500"," I just know that the other people are trading it. "
"15835720","15837660"," I know that there's software out there that trades it."
"15837660","15840380"," I know there are hedge funds that use Elliott wave exclusively."
"15840800","15842320"," So I have to respect that stuff. "
"15843080","15848000"," I look for, you know, anyways, we talked about this ad nauseam at this point."
"15848520","15850220"," I think I brought it up like five times."
"15850220","15851840"," I talked about it like for an hour yesterday. "
"15854320","15860620"," So anyways, for today, not in any trades other than a put position."
"15861480","15865660"," I hope that some of you were that were in calls, second call positions that you're able to get it,"
"15865840","15871820"," you know, you did have a pretty decent chance there either on the spire and Tesla or whatever"
"15871820","15872540"," stocks you're in."
"15876100","15878060"," There's mixed flow coming in right now. "
"15878140","15878840"," There's XLE puts."
"15880480","15882900"," There's Las Vegas Sands puts coming in."
"15883060","15886920"," There's spy puts, Vicks calls, Twitter calls, gold calls. "
"15888000","15892240"," M.A.R. has calls, BP has calls, while XLE has puts."
"15892820","15895600"," Okay, maybe they're just the natural gas trade is on."
"15895760","15895980"," I don't know. "
"15896380","15900700"," We have Tesla calls coming in for 1105 expiring January 14th."
"15900760","15901620"," That doesn't do it."
"15902360","15910480"," Like you can't see as a half million dollars coming in right now for January 14th, 1105 calls. "
"15911160","15912420"," That doesn't cut the mustard."
"15912660","15918100"," You really want to see like 1200, 1300 calls coming in for millions of dollars."
"15918820","15922980"," We got some QQQ puts coming in February 25th, 380 P."
"15923760","15928620"," We got spy calls coming in 471 for January 14th. "
"15928700","15934120"," I mean, these things work well for day trading, but if you think we're moving up to like 478 or"
"15934120","15940100"," 500, unless we see those calls, we don't see that expansion above, which are my camera on for you."
"15940820","15943100"," I'm moving my hands here trying to explain things."
"15946500","15954560"," If you don't see an expansion of the calls, let's say we're trading here today, right?"
"15954560","15955660"," We're trading. "
"15956400","15961300"," And instead of seeing expansion in calls, you're seeing expansion in puts."
"15963100","15969700"," And so your roof on calls gets lower and lower and lower, and then we wind up trading within this"
"15969700","15971220"," lower area, right?"
"15972000","15980080"," If you see any stock in an ETF, if the max calls are seen on Tesla's 1100, you're not going"
"15980080","15981940"," to trade 12 or 1300 ain't going to happen."
"15981940","15988700"," You need to see calls instead of at 1100 at 1300, and you can see how you get the expansion"
"15988700","15992080"," and contraction trading area, right?"
"15992200","15992540"," A range. "
"15993220","15998220"," Even if we trade outside of the implied range for that day, for the month and for the three months,"
"15998260","16003780"," you're going to see this expanding contract based upon how bullish and bearish we are."
"16005120","16007580"," So, and right today was not a good day for that."
"16007700","16012300"," Today is not a day where we saw the call expansion for earnings reports. "
"16013440","16020740"," We saw though lots of hedging down below, and that scares me being a bull."
"16022020","16028380"," So my point would be that I wait for the spy, wait for stocks to settle."
"16029080","16035980"," Let's say I wait for 468, and at 468 I know I can't go to 480, but I know that"
"16035980","16039940"," I can probably go to 476, probably 475. "
"16041040","16044080"," So maybe my trading area is now 468, 475."
"16044560","16047760"," As a day trader, you can trade within that area, okay?"
"16049380","16054920"," And when we're at the top today, you're buying put spreads along with the hedges to protect that"
"16054920","16057680"," downside while taking longs in this market."
"16060880","16066260"," So I'm going to, we'll take a look at, we'll take a look at GLD real quick. "
"16066780","16068940"," There's a lot of calls coming in on GLD right now."
"16068940","16071980"," I don't like trading gold, but I know some gold bugs out there."
"16072200","16074160"," I know some gold bears out there too. "
"16074800","16080440"," So we'll check out the gold ETF, or I don't know if it's an ETF, but I know that they"
"16080440","16081900"," trade real physical gold."
"16088780","16091860"," The gold calls coming in are January 14th, 172."
"16092880","16094280"," It is trading up currently. "
"16095820","16106180"," There is resistance above though, if you are a gold bug, there's resistance above at 170.94. You've"
"16106180","16107580"," got more buyers than sellers."
"16109720","16114180"," And you've got a pretty decent tarot indicator on gold."
"16115220","16118680"," On GLD, not gold, but the GLD ETF. "
"16120000","16121080"," I think it's an ETF."
"16121220","16124860"," I think it's like not an ETF, but an ETF."
"16128190","16129890"," They accumulate gold. "
"16133910","16136470"," It mirrors the gold market, gold commodity market."
"16137430","16140650"," So yes, your sellers are at just above here."
"16140750","16141110"," They're not far. "
"16142710","16144890"," So I don't know why people are buying gold right now."
"16146150","16147670"," 170, where's the sellers at?"
"16149830","16153110"," 170.94. That's a sketchy trade."
"16153650","16156730"," Like if I didn't have book map, I don't know that I'd take this trade. "
"16162930","16166050"," Gold's been going up for one, two, three, four days."
"16167150","16176050"," And you have resistance sellers at 170.94. Does anybody really think it's going to green-barred up"
"16176050","16176170"," here?"
"16176310","16176490"," Maybe."
"16177390","16178090"," It's possible. "
"16179550","16180770"," But it's looking like there."
"16180930","16184570"," It looks like they're trying to find some bag holders here."
"16185470","16186970"," Let's see if we can see anything above it. "
"16189610","16190870"," I don't like this trade either."
"16192610","16193810"," No, I don't like trade at all."
"16194490","16196270"," And that's just something happening we don't know. "
"16196670","16197090"," It's possible."
"16198430","16199510"," This is firm resistance."
"16200650","16202690"," I might actually make a nice short, to be honest with you. "
"16205610","16207730"," I'm interested to see how this trade works out."
"16208390","16211810"," Because I'm seeing a January 14th."
"16215150","16215590"," 172C. "
"16217270","16217950"," Two days."
"16220910","16221650"," That's a tough trade."
"16225330","16229850"," I've seen some FCX puts coming in January 21, 42P. "
"16235200","16236940"," And I'm doubting that gold trade."
"16238460","16241500"," I think that's like somebody long gold for a bunch of money."
"16242100","16250540"," And they want to use that 60 grand to just finish out their position, using calls to maximize their"
"16250540","16251140"," gold position. "
"16253680","16255260"," Yeah, 468 down here."
"16260220","16261880"," Let me know in the comments what you guys think."
"16263200","16265760"," Yeah, they always do get excited at the tops, don't they?"
"16267660","16269600"," Yeah, gold does look weak to me as well. "
"16275890","16277890"," Yeah, I use the..."
"16277890","16283150"," If you guys ever want me to, I can post every day the implied move."
"16283890","16285630"," I know the implied move on the daily."
"16286730","16287630"," I check that every morning. "
"16291240","16292200"," That's a winky."
"16292300","16294020"," I like Roblox winky."
"16294180","16294940"," I want to see that too. "
"16296160","16298780"," If you guys want me to give you the implied move every day, I can."
"16299160","16300460"," I can give you the implied move."
"16300780","16305580"," And I have a website that shows the dot plot. "
"16306800","16309500"," So I'll see if I can drag that out for you guys."
"16309640","16312520"," I'll post a link on Twitter if I can find it."
"16313220","16316120"," That shows the dot plot of where all the options are at. "
"16322560","16323400"," Let's look at..."
"16323400","16325020"," I don't like..."
"16325020","16328040"," I don't like..."
"16329020","16331400"," Spy until 468 or so."
"16332840","16333360"," 46832."
"16333680","16335120"," I will probably buy that dip though. "
"16338220","16340460"," I'm going to look for a reaction and see what's going on."
"16341400","16341600"," Look at this."
"16341760","16343260"," I love Roblox. "
"16343400","16345720"," Roblox in the FRM every time I bring their chart up."
"16346960","16348580"," That shit's always bashing around."
"16351760","16352800"," I love Roblox. "
"16352800","16361670"," I love watching how Roblox and FRM trades just wild."
"16371500","16374840"," You know, it's a bunch of boiler rooms that are just trading against each other."
"16380320","16384060"," We'll look at Roblox next because it looks like it's going to fall off the face of the earth too. "
"16385279","16385720"," RBLX."
"16390240","16391580"," And I like Roblox here."
"16393040","16393300"," I do. "
"16394419","16395040"," We're close to it."
"16395160","16395860"," Let's say..."
"16395860","16396520"," How about this?"
"16397099","16399400"," If Roblox sells off into the bell..."
"16400180","16402060"," Dips below it's current trend."
"16402619","16404860"," It's in a channel right, a three day trip channel right here. "
"16405460","16407200"," Let's see if Roblox sells off into the close."
"16407820","16409960"," And you might grab one more dip buy down here."
"16410540","16411419"," I think it has great support. "
"16411680","16412119"," I like Roblox."
"16413040","16419720"," You got some major buyers down here at $80.30. Looking like some buyers stepped up currently."
"16420640","16423300"," Looks like they're either disappeared or they've moved up. "
"16424180","16425619"," You got more buyers than sellers."
"16426279","16428220"," You have some weak put flow on it."
"16428220","16429419"," You can see some put flow right here. "
"16430180","16431580"," These are put options."
"16432220","16433460"," The red triangles are put options."
"16433599","16435080"," The green triangles are call options. "
"16436000","16437779"," That's what the hair indicator is showing."
"16438640","16444160"," Let's look at the hair indicator on Roblox and see if we're overall negative or positive."
"16447300","16448840"," I don't like seeing this right here. "
"16448900","16449619"," You guys want to see something?"
"16450540","16452300"," We'll look at this at a larger timeframe."
"16452619","16453419"," Let's look at..."
"16453419","16456419"," If you guys have a book map and you have hair indicator..."
"16457540","16464640"," If you scroll back in time for the day, you can get a feeling for where the price is heading."
"16466220","16469360"," You can see where the price is heading. "
"16469980","16475020"," I don't necessarily care for the hero on this right now."
"16475960","16477439"," I think we see weakness in the close."
"16477919","16482520"," It could be wrong on this, but I do think we see some weakness in the close. "
"16482520","16486160"," I would be interested, though, in picking up some Roblox again."
"16486939","16489660"," I like it down here in 80, 75, 78."
"16490480","16491119"," I like it. "
"16491380","16492439"," Where's the big money at?"
"16497020","16498180"," You guys know when it rips."
"16498320","16498640"," It rips."
"16499540","16500320"," It gets stupid. "
"16502200","16503700"," This ticker is a printing machine."
"16504439","16506759"," Roblox is AFR arms printing machine."
"16508040","16509439"," It's like 86 bucks. "
"16511300","16515419"," $80.35. Clear skies ahead, man."
"16516140","16520380"," If Roblox gets a kickass ER, it's going to frickin' rip."
"16521060","16522980"," It hasn't been pumped up for its ER. "
"16524419","16525060"," Not really."
"16525660","16528099"," It's been pumped up, but I don't think it's done."
"16529200","16532599"," I like it as a long ownership trade. "
"16533340","16536119"," I'm hoping to buy Roblox between now and March."
"16537419","16539960"," I bought it before, and I want to buy it again."
"16543560","16544619"," I like the stock. "
"16544619","16548099"," I still like the stock."
"16551140","16556320"," Another thing to notice about Spy right here is you'll hear a lot of futures traders."
"16557160","16562560"," They'll tell you that when they see stuff like this, that eventually the price, if the price can't"
"16562560","16567800"," go up on its own, that eventually the price will come down to where the buyers are. "
"16568740","16571800"," To a common, common is among futures traders."
"16571800","16577939"," They look for setups like this because unless they see this big power move up, they're looking to"
"16577939","16578400"," take a trade."
"16579240","16585860"," Unless they see the buyers step in here, you'll have a tendency for the price to move down to where"
"16585860","16587360"," the actual supply is. "
"16591939","16594660"," It's always good to follow futures traders, globe X traders."
"16595320","16601040"," They have some really good insight into sure thing trades, right?"
"16602080","16607840"," Or select some rules that they have that are easily applicable to the cash market and worth"
"16607840","16608340"," studying."
"16615770","16619410"," Let's take a little bit farther look out at AFRM. "
"16620650","16621610"," See what it's doing."
"16622070","16623590"," The AFRM is on a cliff right now."
"16626570","16628150"," So I don't like AFRM right now. "
"16628970","16629490"," Not at all."
"16631369","16632430"," I don't like it at all."
"16633050","16634730"," It's very dangerous right now in AFRM. "
"16636349","16637970"," It's dangerous even below 70."
"16639130","16641770"," I'd be wary if I was in AFRM right now."
"16642270","16645910"," You got more buyers than sellers here on AFRM, but I don't like it. "
"16646830","16648009"," It's not the best setup."
"16648990","16650930"," You got sellers at 90 bucks."
"16652509","16655130"," So you got another 10 bucks you can move up on there. "
"16655790","16657110"," I just don't like it."
"16660250","16661529"," I don't like this setup at all."
"16663830","16665230"," It's like if they're hiding something. "
"16666550","16669130"," You got clear blue skies below here."
"16670430","16672369"," You got some support at 87 bucks."
"16673770","16675110"," More support at 65. "
"16676189","16678810"," Looks like the buyers are stepped right in on it right now."
"16679090","16680930"," Like they're actively supporting it."
"16681050","16682029"," Yeah, here it is right here. "
"16682669","16685509"," So you got active buyers supporting at $80."
"16686189","16687990"," I guess you could take a long in AFRM here."
"16688550","16693150"," I would have a tight stop at 79.93 if you break through this. "
"16694770","16696490"," This is all the supply right here."
"16697029","16701410"," You're on a tight rope right now with AFRM."
"16702490","16705810"," This is a great trade, but a dangerous trade. "
"16716960","16718759"," Some of you guys are more cowboys than I am."
"16721119","16722880"," My thought is that we sell off in a close."
"16726099","16728460"," It's smelling and walking and looking like a duck. "
"16783810","16784690"," I apologize."
"16784950","16785990"," I had to duck out for a minute."
"16786670","16789050"," My daughter came downstairs to ask me some questions. "
"16790290","16791850"," Let me know what you guys think in the chat."
"16791990","16793250"," I'm looking at the chat right now."
"16799680","16801060"," Yeah, I didn't like. "
"16801360","16802000"," Yeah, I love."
"16802220","16805240"," I've got some Mark Metervini books here."
"16806020","16806680"," Love them. "
"16815840","16817620"," Can I look at El City again?"
"16819700","16820740"," I'll take a look at that."
"16823890","16826890"," Didn't we talk about yesterday at the store yesterday?"
"16827470","16832310"," We talked about how there was a wall of sellers hiding above."
"16858620","16860900"," Yeah, Joe Donut was eating like crazy. "
"16861760","16864600"," Eating these really crazy shrimps and fries and stuff."
"16865660","16866480"," He's having lunch."
"16867360","16869200"," Chatted him up for a minute on lunch today. "
"16872480","16877060"," For 70 P's or just pinging between negative and positive."
"16880540","16882980"," Yeah, I'll take a look at the Q-com chart."
"16883800","16884900"," I'll look at El City. "
"16885880","16890560"," I think yesterday we were talking about how El City was just sitting right at a sell zone."
"16891220","16893840"," And we've looked at some charts today that had that same look, right?"
"16896850","16897850"," You can see him, dude."
"16898070","16899110"," Wall of sellers above. "
"16899410","16899730"," Look at this."
"16902070","16905390"," You are critical support right now on Lucid."
"16907210","16908610"," This is critical support. "
"16910230","16910830"," Elevator down."
"16911110","16912170"," You guys want to see where that is."
"16912450","16912730"," I don't want to. "
"16912930","16913870"," Oh, it's not that ugly."
"16916430","16919950"," I know that some of you guys really like this ticker."
"16920010","16921370"," I never want to see how ugly it can get. "
"16922510","16923290"," Thirty bucks."
"16926890","16928250"," So what would I say to you?"
"16928770","16930330"," I would say this."
"16931610","16934350"," I would say that you just tagged. "
"16936030","16936970"," Critical support."
"16939290","16943410"," If you're in puts, I'd say take your money and run right now."
"16944190","16945590"," I would say pick it back up. "
"16946930","16948370"," It's going to be some volume."
"16948370","16949750"," I'm sure you get some volatility here."
"16953370","16960830"," I'd say pick it back up below $44.15. Run it down to $42 if you're short this stock. "
"16962950","16968330"," It's rough because this could trade down to $30."
"16970090","16971410"," That's kind of shocking to say."
"16972210","16974610"," I don't think it trades down to $40 to $30. "
"16976190","16977790"," But man, it's got a pin on it."
"16978550","16979770"," Pin out a hell on it."
"16982930","16984170"," I'm going to know you guys think about it. "
"16984390","16985450"," LLC ID right here."
"16994140","17000900"," So Captain Ron's saying his theory is that LLC ID is being pumped with positive news from the"
"17000900","17006700"," Saudis right now so the share price doesn't dump into the lockup so they can sell higher."
"17007520","17009640"," Yeah, I'm wondering right now. "
"17009720","17011180"," I mean, we're crashing through right now."
"17011780","17014160"," LLC ID is dumping right now in this."
"17016500","17018480"," LLC ID has risk. "
"17018980","17019740"," I want you to know that."
"17021980","17023620"," There's no diamond hands in this one."
"17024700","17029460"," I want to warn you right now that LLC ID right now has a chance and a risk, a real"
"17029460","17031180"," risk to trade down to $30. "
"17032380","17033720"," Whether you believe it or not."
"17035840","17037720"," I'm not bearish on on Lucid."
"17039340","17041300"," I'm showing you where the money is, right?"
"17044020","17052620"," You've got 80 or you've got 805,000 sellers on the CBD versus 346,000"
"17052620","17055040"," buyers. "
"17055680","17058080"," And what you're looking for is a capitulation move."
"17059120","17061140"," You're going to look like capitulation down to like $30."
"17061140","17065820"," Anywhere from 30 to 40, let's say, you end up getting a capitulation move. "
"17066600","17070560"," You get panicked bulls and they just start selling out of their positions."
"17071700","17072820"," And it rains in the clothes."
"17073040","17074080"," It's happening right now, guys. "
"17077080","17078320"," What's happening right now?"
"17082880","17092460"," $43.95. Clear skies below to $43.06. I'll show you guys some better numbers here, some targets."
"17095280","17106780"," Some support at $42.10. Let's"
"17106780","17107400"," give me a tough one."
"17108920","17110440"," For Lucid, Lucid holders. "
"17113540","17115380"," This is tough for Lucid holders."
"17116060","17118600"," Got a lot of stakeholders selling out right now."
"17118600","17125160"," A whole bunch of stakeholders selling out of LCID. "
"17131890","17138270"," And the last capitulation moment was at $33."
"17140730","17143050"," So we know we can trade down to $33."
"17145690","17151190"," And that was only what five trading days ago, right?"
"17152590","17153470"," January 6th. "
"17153870","17155110"," We make a capitulation move."
"17159460","17162680"," This looks like whoever drove it up has taken some profit."
"17164180","17165780"," Now, there are some things to note here. "
"17167800","17169740"," $42.93 on a candlestick chart."
"17170640","17171920"," We can look at that one."
"17173280","17178580"," A candlestick chart, you're going to look for a bounce at $42.93. That's what this support level is"
"17178580","17178960"," right here. "
"17180840","17182400"," You expect a bounce here."
"17183260","17192160"," Next one's $39.40. Let's see if there's some support at $39.40. Let's see if anyone's waiting down"
"17192160","17192680"," below there."
"17193280","17194520"," You get some support building up. "
"17194640","17195240"," This is good to see."
"17195460","17196740"," This is all starting to change here."
"17197320","17199640"," You are seeing some buyers step in right now. "
"17200480","17202240"," Not a ton, but some."
"17202500","17203800"," You get some buyers here at $42."
"17205700","17207820"," Looks like they're coming a little bit lower. "
"17212610","17214150"," And then again at $40."
"17214430","17215270"," That makes sense."
"17216710","17226430"," These are both, you know, if you're a look at a consolidation range between $48.40, you might not"
"17226430","17227110"," trade down to $30. "
"17227470","17227750"," How about this?"
"17227890","17235350"," I'll give you a expected capitulation move in Lucid to $4,206."
"17235350","17237570"," $42.88, somewhere in there."
"17239710","17244450"," You'll break through that $43.93. It'll be like two seconds you're down here and then you're back"
"17244450","17244850"," up again. "
"17246550","17248030"," Sell the world is probably $40."
"17248510","17249970"," So I take that back on $30."
"17258940","17259860"," Now it's interesting. "
"17260200","17265220"," I have a close family friend that works for Lucid."
"17268480","17270320"," And he says he's never stolen."
"17272400","17275920"," He believes fully in the concept in the car company. "
"17276680","17277800"," He said he never stolen."
"17279400","17281140"," He said he's in it for the long haul."
"17304660","17306560"," But I don't think the banks do that. "
"17306660","17309300"," I think the banks take the money and run."
"17311160","17312540"," Maybe the Saudis or whoever."
"17321270","17322970"," Let me see you guys are writing over here. "
"17324510","17325910"," You'll follow up with you guys."
"17329790","17330230"," Qcom."
"17330390","17331450"," I'll look at Qcom right now. "
"17337070","17339630"," That's some nice consolidation on Qcom, isn't it?"
"17342070","17343530"," I like that consolidation."
"17354120","17355980"," Talk about a great place to trade."
"17356280","17357200"," Qcom trades like Amazon. "
"17357820","17358400"," Excuse me."
"17360260","17363740"," Qcom trades like Amazon buy every one of those dips."
"17375610","17377630"," That's such an easy trading plan in Qcom. "
"17379370","17381450"," That you could just trade Qcom be wealthy."
"17382890","17385890"," Every time it tips to 173 buy."
"17390240","17391640"," See what it looks like at 173. "
"17393180","17395980"," It just must be like bank money there at all times."
"17413200","17415780"," A resistance on Qcom at 189."
"17417400","17417920"," 192. "
"17419140","17419660"," 194."
"17421140","17421660"," 199."
"17423340","17424520"," That makes sense, right?"
"17425220","17429840"," I bet you when they start selling here, they reappear down below here 173. "
"17430660","17431720"," Right here you can see the line."
"17432960","17434260"," Is that red line right there?"
"17435400","17437180"," Is that red line that appears and disappears?"
"17438900","17440320"," You guys see it on the screen?"
"17441540","17442840"," Is that red line up here?"
"17444540","17447840"," 174.20. It's a great trade."
"17448220","17448720"," I like this trade. "
"17449540","17454300"," You guys can set like a snap a line in your charts."
"17454920","17457700"," Set an email alert to your email address or your phone."
"17458760","17461220"," Every time it bounces down here to 174 buy it. "
"17464010","17465210"," Talk about easy trading."
"17468170","17478020"," Yeah, the"
"17478020","17479580"," channel is amazing on Qcom."
"17481500","17482180"," Amazing. "
"17483140","17486120"," Uh oh, spy is so boring."
"17488180","17492420"," Printed like 1,200% into the open today."
"17492920","17495900"," Printed 6 or 800% on the other side of my calls. "
"17497480","17500220"," Then the puts were killer today as well."
"17500540","17501480"," It's two sick moves."
"17505020","17506860"," A hero is above where?"
"17507080","17507580"," You mean on the spy?"
"17510100","17513420"," You guys want to see the hero indicator on the spy?"
"17516400","17517660"," You guys want to see the real deal?"
"17519620","17521500"," So you got to do it by time, right?"
"17521620","17523100"," We talk about time all the time, right?"
"17523840","17526540"," What does the hero indicator say for the entire day?"
"17527540","17530080"," Now, do you see the difference here what I'm talking to you about?"
"17533440","17536020"," I'll show you the hero indicator over the course of the day. "
"17536680","17537540"," Do you see this right here?"
"17538380","17543780"," Remember when I tell you like the price of spy might be one thing, and yet the hero indicator is"
"17543780","17550820"," telling you something completely, a completely different story than what the price of spy says it"
"17550820","17551040"," is."
"17552080","17553100"," All right, do you see this?"
"17553980","17557580"," This is an example that I've talked about in the past, and if we finally have one."
"17558980","17560660"," You've got crazy puts coming through. "
"17561160","17566720"," You're probably going to see, if any of you guys subscribe to spot gamma, I guarantee you that"
"17566720","17572920"," they're going to release a daily note and they're going to show you this hero indicator for the"
"17572920","17578320"," day, and they're going to say this is all hedging, and we didn't see fall through and call flow."
"17578320","17583080"," I bet that's in tonight's notes by like 5 p.m. I bet you see this."
"17583960","17585460"," You'll hear that from them. "
"17586580","17589640"," So when you want to know why I'm not taking calls, it's right here."
"17590400","17591360"," That's why I'm not taking calls."
"17593160","17593880"," Too risky. "
"17615180","17618060"," Nothing's adding up to take calls on the spy for me right now."
"17626400","17633200"," We're going to look to see if the spy reacts on this support at 468, where I am."
"17633720","17637480"," I'm looking to see if we get a reaction at 468. "
"17638300","17644640"," If we trade through 468, then we know that we're going to trade lower, right?"
"17645160","17652020"," We'll look to see if the support is removed at 468, and if we're going to trade lower."
"17656690","17659250"," You saw the snapback play."
"17659250","17661690"," You guys should look at a one-day chart in the spy. "
"17662210","17664190"," You see the first fall, right?"
"17664650","17671850"," You see the snapback trade, and you can actually compare the peak of the snapback trade to the"
"17671850","17672550"," original fall."
"17673610","17676070"," And you'll see that first dip we have, right?"
"17676590","17678430"," We traded right up to that first dip."
"17679110","17682190"," We capitulated sideways, capitulated some more. "
"17682890","17687550"," Then we traded back up, a little bit of sideways movement, moving slightly up, and you're starting"
"17687550","17692950"," to see the bulls realize that we would have to go to like 480 for their calls to print."
"17693690","17696090"," So they're going to capitulate into the close."
"17697710","17698490"," That's my guess. "
"17701780","17704360"," And the next question becomes, what's our new trading range, right?"
"17705960","17707140"," What's the top now, right?"
"17707340","17709640"," Let's say it was 476, 475."
"17710660","17715480"," When we talked yesterday about everyone's going to tell you, I said GSA, people are going to say"
"17715480","17715860"," it's 480."
"17717100","17719660"," The reality is, the most it'll be is 478. "
"17720320","17721560"," More probable, 475."
"17723160","17727420"," And then when we hit this wall above here this morning, we see all this hedging coming in."
"17728100","17730880"," We know now that that number is out the window, right?"
"17731040","17734100"," We know that the wall is probably now 473. "
"17735980","17736260"," At max."
"17737540","17738260"," It's probably 470."
"17739820","17742300"," We're starting to cross back into a volatility area. "
"17742300","17744700"," None of this stuff says bullish to me."
"17747180","17748560"," I hope my puts didn't."
"17748680","17750020"," I still had an order in my puts. "
"17750640","17751560"," I hope that they don't sell."
"17752300","17753860"," I'm going to take my sell-out order off, I think."
"17763780","17765580"," I'm going to cancel my sell order. "
"17766260","17770840"," I just want to see how ugly it gets."
"17772480","17775380"," Is this going to get effing ugly around here in a little bit?"
"17781040","17781840"," Brad Armitage."
"17786020","17787800"," You want to know something about your..."
"17787800","17789600"," You got 128 naked calls here. "
"17790000","17792160"," What do you have, Brad?"
"17795220","17796340"," For calls, brother."
"17799900","17802100"," Can you tag me with what you've got for calls?"
"17802420","17803600"," Because you're already selling off right now."
"17805040","17806940"," You should have taken the profit and ran, man. "
"17808180","17809740"," Shit, I wish I had seen this from you."
"17812620","17814360"," We'll look at Tesla right now, brother."
"17820540","17821960"," Shit, I wish I caught that. "
"17823520","17825460"," We talked about Tesla earlier, right?"
"17825820","17827540"," Did you miss me talking about Tesla earlier?"
"17828060","17828740"," If you weren't in the stream."
"17830500","17833420"," We'll bring up the Tesla chart right now for any Tesla gang out there."
"17833840","17836180"," There is a little bit of support here in Tesla. "
"17836840","17838300"," We're going to see if this is real or fake."
"17843000","17847780"," I have the same thought process, though, in Tesla that I have on spy."
"17851480","17856180"," What happens is Tesla bulls realize that they have to double down. "
"17856420","17860700"," If they don't double down in the calls, when we first rode up to 1100, right?"
"17861200","17861600"," You get the print."
"17861940","17864840"," Let's say in the money 1100 call this morning."
"17865420","17866440"," Let's say it was worth 100 bucks. "
"17867480","17872600"," When you fall down and then ride back, ride it back up, you don't have as much volume inside of"
"17872600","17874080"," that call to go to 1100 bucks."
"17874300","17875820"," You're losing premium on that."
"17876360","17879380"," Then, because of time, you're losing more premium. "
"17879660","17885180"," If you were in the original 1100 call, you needed to go to like 1150 or something to just break"
"17885180","17885540"," even."
"17885880","17887340"," Not even start making profit."
"17888540","17893020"," You end up being upset down unless you double down, triple down at the first dip, right?"
"17894580","17898940"," You've got bulls that realize this, that they're not going to print. "
"17899680","17900440"," They start to panic."
"17901440","17904560"," We're going to look to see where support is on Tesla right now."
"17908960","17914040"," Although I do believe in the Tesla trade, I don't think that Tesla is going to fall. "
"17916020","17918420"," There's some negative gamma right now or not negative gamma."
"17918620","17922000"," That negative here indicator is more sellers than buyers right now."
"17922000","17927400"," If I had to guess this is capitulation move on, Tesla. "
"17929180","17930940"," What are your dates, man?"
"17932340","17932780"," 128."
"17934740","17936160"," I like 128 calls."
"17937320","17938680"," Are you green or upside down in them?"
"17941900","17942820"," When did you buy them?"
"17942900","17943300"," I need more information. "
"17944240","17946140"," I need to know when you bought your calls."
"17952280","17953480"," Hey Brad, you still there?"
"17966180","17968740"," Is it really as a firearm doing that right now?"
"17974600","17975880"," Yeah, there it goes, right?"
"17977860","17979080"," Bye-bye, a firm."
"17981740","17983040"," Bye-bye, roblox. "
"17985180","17990740"," A little bit of basing on and I'll lose it, but I'm going to expect some more selling."
"17997260","17998140"," How's hood doing?"
"18000320","18001580"," Any capitulation hood yet?"
"18008300","18009540"," It's not doing too bad."
"18010700","18013400"," It's good to see when you, you know, I want you guys to see something else too. "
"18013980","18019620"," So all this nastiness today in hoods holding up, that's interesting to see that means that the"
"18019620","18021640"," banks aren't willing to cut themselves out of it yet."
"18025280","18026560"," Is Brad still in here?"
"18027000","18027940"," Anyone know if Brad's around?"
"18038340","18039940"," Thank you, Jill, for the tip."
"18040120","18041340"," I appreciate it if you're still here. "
"18051040","18060660"," Yeah, so Henry, I want you to look at, so Henry, that's a good point, Henry, but still anyway, you"
"18060660","18061040"," look at this."
"18065460","18075420"," So I want you to look at, you have to look at the calls that were coming in"
"18075420","18078300"," this morning on Tesla, right?"
"18079060","18086440"," But until it hit 1100, and then once it's sold down, the call structure changes."
"18108180","18112640"," I don't know if that means anything, so I want to show you guys right here. "
"18112640","18115210"," Hold on."
"18120590","18123010"," And Tesla's ripping back up to 1100."
"18123710","18124470"," Hilarious. "
"18124970","18125370"," Love Tesla."
"18127810","18128570"," Monsters."
"18133470","18135010"," Let's see, I'm bringing this back. "
"18142760","18144100"," We can load this up."
"18147400","18150320"," Tesla just bashing up to 1100."
"18151600","18152780"," It's a sicko bill. "
"18153060","18154820"," I love Tesla bulls."
"18155560","18156120"," They don't care."
"18162490","18164150"," Tesla bulls do not care. "
"18169760","18171460"," Let's see if we break through here."
"18172080","18173960"," Let's look to see if there's more targets above."
"18183130","18190830"," Yeah, same place, 1150, 1105, 1109. "
"18193310","18196270"," We still have that ultimate target of 1200."
"18197130","18204950"," I want to know when Bradbot is the Tesla calls."
"18212250","18213610"," 1159, 1225. "
"18214650","18236280"," I love Tesla"
"18236280","18236600"," gang."
"18237520","18238620"," They don't care."
"18239240","18240760"," They don't care about anything. "
"18241720","18245740"," They're like the savages of the stock market."
"18246740","18247920"," They just grind."
"18251340","18257160"," I'm going to put a price target of 1250. "
"18261690","18263570"," Tesla gang just doesn't care."
"18274880","18278480"," You will have a squeeze opportunity here."
"18278880","18287320"," If you are able to break through 1100 here, where did I measure it at 1138 or something?"
"18289840","18297260"," So if you break through 1111, measure it again. "
"18299300","18300980"," Guys are monsters."
"18320080","18321560"," Yeah, 1138."
"18328620","18332510"," I want that line. "
"18351460","18361440"," I'd be interested to see if a trade is up to 1138, because that would carry spy"
"18361440","18362120"," into the close."
"18371780","18376040"," Every time I take these Tesla trades, if you guys, I end up losing my shirt."
"18378500","18379560"," Give away everything I made. "
"18380420","18383360"," Yeah, it's bottoming out the spy, too."
"18383360","18386940"," I love it."
"18387040","18389360"," I love the Tesla trades with spy now somewhat. "
"18390440","18394820"," It's way more than it used to use the trade with IWM back in the day."
"18402500","18404300"," Let's get a little bit closer here."
"18417420","18419220"," Good heads up on that Tesla trade. "
"18425580","18427540"," Who said something about Tesla earlier?"
"18441160","18446580"," Did Henry Abanto, Henry A, he called that stuff out."
"18446840","18447540"," Right on, brother."
"18463700","18464840"," Amazon is stalling. "
"18469260","18471660"," Did its ripping right now or smashing through."
"18473580","18475840"," Tesla's just ripping through right now."
"18476640","18478920"," Hero indicators turning green right now. "
"18479340","18480500"," It's at 600."
"18481200","18483380"," It's flipping green right now as we're talking."
"18486520","18491760"," Your next target above is 1109 110. "
"18495180","18496340"," Where's Brad?"
"18518280","18521700"," We'll get this even more granular if you're in calls right now."
"18526800","18528120"," Hero indicators turning green."
"18528280","18533060"," We just smashed through three huge levels of resistance on Tesla. "
"18533060","18538760"," The bulls are targeting the rip through 1109 next, 11010."
"18591220","18593800"," A little bit more granular here."
"18600360","18601520"," That's a nice one right there. "
"18602920","18605480"," Hero indicators up to 1200 was that 300."
"18609330","18611750"," First price target or the next price target."
"18612070","18613810"," You might have some settling here. "
"18614390","18616630"," It is 217 in the afternoon."
"18620030","18622090"," Next price target 1109 110."
"18623570","18625290"," The bulls are gangsters. "
"18656150","18661770"," Seeing some more Tesla call flow coming in January 14th, 1120."
"18665560","18667240"," $357,000."
"18688900","18691820"," Natural gas is just killing everybody. "
"18692800","18700840"," UNG is just peaked out at 1619 with more calls coming in."
"18703860","18712040"," Which is insane."
"18716880","18718500"," Look at UNG real quick. "
"18720000","18724380"," You guys are going to be paying like triple for your gas bills this winter."
"18726400","18728780"," The blue skies on this one too."
"18729660","18731280"," They get some sellers in there now. "
"18731420","18733240"," But look at how many people are in the gas trade."
"18733820","18734280"," It's insane."
"18741590","18742790"," Everybody's in the gas trade. "
"18743670","18745870"," 329 on the UNG trade."
"18746650","18748310"," 283 on the buy side."
"18750630","18753070"," It's just green bar and it's straight up into the close. "
"18756250","18757670"," There's no sailing here."
"18762000","18771800"," It's just pure like just print it."
"18777360","18780460"," We're just we're green barring it up on UNG. "
"18782660","18787640"," Someone just placed a quick $35,000 on 18C."
"18788360","18790680"," Expiring January 28th, they don't even care."
"18796570","18798150"," I think that's United Natural Gas. "
"18808790","18811310"," This is nice to see on Tesla here."
"18812850","18817090"," It's nice to see this support here in Tesla at 1102."
"18817410","18818950"," You want to be breaking through 1108. "
"18819590","18824790"," If you break through 1108, next stop is 1120."
"18825670","18827250"," And then I think we're at 1150, right?"
"18827250","18829070"," That was what we saw earlier."
"18830790","18832250"," Yep, there it is right there. "
"18834890","18835450"," 114854."
"18838720","18843060"," If you can break through 1100, or excuse me, 110."
"18850160","18853340"," Tell your friends to buy like 1200 C's. "
"18854040","18856460"," And you'll see us at 1150."
"18876010","18876990"," Yeah, thanks, Julie."
"18876990","18877750"," I appreciate it. "
"18878170","18878690"," Really do."
"18880510","18881630"," Ritesh, how you doing?"
"18882350","18885130"," Yeah, I took off as well for the most part of the day."
"18885250","18886590"," I've made enough good trades. "
"18886770","18887830"," I don't need to over trade today."
"18888550","18892890"," There was a snapback trade on the spy and started to sell off."
"18893130","18896090"," And then out of nowhere, Tesla just keeps consolidating. "
"18896270","18896710"," Nobody cares."
"18897370","18899590"," This is the usual shit with Tesla on ER."
"18900190","18906950"," Whatever the run-up happens, whether it's after ER or before ER, Tesla's in full swing. "
"18907190","18910330"," Tesla doesn't care if the market sells down to 150."
"18911170","18916330"," You'll see Tesla like $2,000 in the market could be burning down in a dumpster fire."
"18917150","18919110"," And of course, Tesla bulls just don't care. "
"18920090","18923010"," They're trading it like we're trading natural gas right now."
"18923590","18924450"," They just don't care."
"18925490","18927390"," They're looking for 1150 right now. "
"18927390","18934090"," They're trying to break through this 1,100 mark currently."
"18934650","18936270"," We'll get it on a more granular level."
"18937930","18943830"," There's lots of heavy Tesla calls coming in right now, even though the market is negative for all"
"18943830","18944550"," intents and purposes. "
"18945250","18948670"," It's actually stopping the spy from trading down into the closing bell."
"18950940","18951840"," They just don't care."
"18952640","18953540"," Hero indicator was negative. "
"18953800","18954520"," It's turned positive."
"18954520","18964100"," We've got 517,000 buyers, the 359,000 sellers flipped on a dime and just started ripping north."
"18970330","18973350"," There was a ping on UNG there just for a moment. "
"18975450","18979610"," And this isn't on a chart anywhere, but I did a measured move."
"18980050","18988470"," If this does flip shorts, it should take us to, I think it should take us like 1138."
"18989870","18997630"," Even if we don't get to the 1150, we should have a big enough squeeze here to get that high"
"18997630","18998490"," somewhere. "
"18998870","18999670"," Give me a second."
"19001110","19002230"," Maybe 1124."
"19006170","19012910"," Let's try for 1124 to begin and see if they can get flipped here. "
"19017100","19018560"," There's some ice above."
"19019200","19022280"," So 1120, 1119, excuse me."
"19022960","19028020"," If you can break above here, your measured move should be to 111940. "
"19030480","19031720"," And that was that test."
"19031960","19037660"," We had that Tesla call that came in for 1120C for $350,000."
"19039200","19040480"," Just a few moments ago. "
"19041100","19042860"," It came in at 217 PM."
"19042860","19044940"," This guy is getting paid right now."
"19055610","19071200"," I don't"
"19071200","19071200"," know. "
"19086990","19089510"," Just monster moves right now on Tesla."
"19090370","19092350"," Just murdering people."
"19092350","19093670"," I mean, look at this. "
"19093930","19097670"," Almost 25% more buyers than sellers."
"19098010","19098590"," Almost there."
"19100190","19105030"," We had like 23, 21% buyers or more buyers than sellers here. "
"19105310","19106810"," Here are indicators off the charts."
"19109440","19110700"," Bulls won 1120."
"19111540","19116740"," If they can't get 1120 and you make a support level here at 1100, this is a very powerful move"
"19116740","19119100"," for Tesla right now to be trading this high. "
"19119320","19126380"," And then if you can at least find support here anywhere between 1100 and let's call it 1100 here"
"19126380","19129240"," and 1110."
"19129560","19131040"," It's very, very bullish for Tesla."
"19143540","19147680"," We'll carry it on a conversation with Quinn in Twitter right now. "
"19150100","19151340"," Talking about you."
"19166600","19168840"," Talking about Quinn on live stream."
"19169300","19171420"," Joe Harper is jumping back into the bunch. "
"19171420","19174560"," Oh, here come all the Tesla bulls in."
"19174740","19178200"," They want to hear the live play-by-play action on Tesla at this point."
"19178800","19180160"," Joe Harper is in here. "
"19180320","19185600"," Tesla 1111 is where today's upward trend line has bounced all day."
"19187540","19189340"," What's up with Spine?"
"19189500","19190480"," Why is it pumping again?"
"19191120","19191620"," It's not pumping."
"19192600","19194920"," It's getting propped up by Tesla. "
"19195400","19197260"," Tesla's holding the market up right now."
"19197700","19198880"," It's pretty wild to see."
"19200640","19202160"," Absolutely cool as shit. "
"19206340","19211260"," Tesla's like old Tim Apple here doing the job that Apple can't seem to do."
"19211760","19214260"," Holding up the entire market, ripping it up."
"19214660","19216620"," I do want you to trade right now. "
"19217320","19221380"," I do want you to pay attention to spy as you trade Tesla."
"19222460","19227640"," We'll look to see if there's any resistance on spy because that can sometimes match up with Tesla."
"19228540","19236400"," It's great to see Tesla finally really trading with a really trade in here with the spy, right?"
"19236620","19237980"," Being an integral component. "
"19238740","19242620"," If you're any guys, remember back in the day, it used to trade all by itself."
"19243520","19247280"," It would be shorted by smaller indexes and IWM."
"19248320","19251280"," It is good to see Tesla moving the spy around. "
"19255090","19258030"," Yeah, there's no sky above on spy right now either."
"19258030","19260610"," So Tesla has free rain to do whatever it wants."
"19261450","19263030"," That's the thing about Tesla right now. "
"19263150","19263530"," It can."
"19264170","19268590"," So it has the potential to move the spy around to rough house the spy."
"19271590","19272250"," We'll let it down. "
"19272370","19273550"," It has the potential to do that."
"19275730","19280330"," Now up 4% in the day, tagging at 110945."
"19281530","19285290"," It really wants to break through here to get to 1120. "
"19285290","19288170"," There's another target above it, 1150."
"19288610","19291250"," And there's an ultimate target above of 1200."
"19292030","19293430"," I don't know if you get that today. "
"19294530","19299210"," But if you make some calls, if in each of the Tesla bulls are out there, you guys want to"
"19299210","19303830"," be talking to your friends and telling them to be buying like 1300 C's or something."
"19304650","19311170"," It expands the call range on Tesla so that you can get to the 1200 to get to 1200."
"19311170","19313610"," You can't be buying 1200 calls. "
"19314150","19316190"," You got to buy like 1300 calls."
"19316590","19317870"," That gets us to 1200."
"19320320","19321720"," Yeah, so 1145. "
"19322200","19324000"," We got down here 1120."
"19325520","19326040"," 1150."
"19328080","19328600"," 1160. "
"19329380","19332500"," And then reality or look, this is the ultimate prize right here."
"19333580","19335480"," You want a moon shot that you want to."
"19336020","19338920"," You want a gun for it's like 12 right here. "
"19338920","19340140"," 1200 bucks."
"19340520","19342020"," But you can't buy 1200 C."
"19342480","19344100"," You got to buy like 1300 C."
"19344440","19345980"," Just throw a bunch of cash at it."
"19346520","19348000"," That's what SoftBank does. "
"19350440","19352460"," That's how SoftBank gets us up there."
"19353320","19355280"," They buy way outside the money calls."
"19356960","19358620"," The wall holding the underlying. "
"19360820","19362440"," That's how the bags do it."
"19362840","19364000"," How the hedge funds do it."
"19367280","19368860"," So tagging out here at 11. "
"19369260","19369360"," 11."
"19370000","19370260"," Oh, nine."
"19370440","19371020"," Let's look and see. "
"19371740","19374680"," I like this structure underneath here at 1100."
"19375240","19378300"," We'll get a little more granular here and see what's up here."
"19378460","19379240"," The cater is off the charts. "
"19379480","19383800"," You still have lots of lots of sellers being absorbed here."
"19389440","19395100"," You want to see if you get a nice bounce here at 11.02. What I see if we're able"
"19395100","19397120"," to to to maintain this area here."
"19397120","19400680"," The longer we grind here, the more this becomes support. "
"19400900","19402740"," We turn this into a support area of support."
"19403260","19406320"," This is very dangerous for bears if you turn this into a support area."
"19411280","19412120"," Oh, shit. "
"19412920","19413600"," I'm in trouble."
"19415180","19415860"," Quinn's here."
"19420140","19421440"," Not about feed, right?"
"19425100","19425620"," Spies. "
"19426520","19431100"," Elmerino's calling out resistance on spy at 471.16. Sorry."
"19431300","19431620"," Sorry."
"19431960","19432460"," I swear. "
"19432460","19434360"," Quinn, we were talking nice about you."
"19436460","19437800"," I promise, brother."
"19438400","19438900"," Everybody. "
"19439260","19439840"," Quinn is here."
"19441940","19443620"," Are we seeing calls bottom spy?"
"19443860","19444300"," Good question."
"19444420","19445440"," We'll take a check right now. "
"19446540","19449220"," And I'll take a look back at spy as well right now."
"19453140","19455540"," Yeah, I'm seeing heavy spy calls coming in."
"19455900","19458900"," So after that, after those that that that Tesla call. "
"19459060","19465800"," So you know that Tesla call that came in for 11.20. I'll let you know what I see here"
"19465800","19466620"," for spy calls."
"19467120","19471240"," January 21, 478 C, $200,000."
"19471640","19475960"," January 21, 478 C, $120,000. "
"19476480","19479780"," January 21, 478 C, $108,000."
"19481000","19485900"," January 21, 478 C, $386,000."
"19486620","19490820"," Spy, January 14, 472 for $92,000. "
"19491760","19495160"," Spy, January 14, 471 for $200,000."
"19495620","19499160"," It's really nice seeing these 478 calls, to be honest with you."
"19499900","19506440"," When I see calls like that, when I see bulls believing in 478 and 500, 480, you'll start to see,"
"19507120","19508500"," we'll become more bullish. "
"19509140","19511280"," That is a good sign heading into the close today."
"19511880","19512760"," It's a nice switch."
"19512760","19519940"," Although I do see some TLT calls for January 28 for $800,000. "
"19520840","19522200"," That's not good to see."
"19522640","19524460"," I don't like seeing TLT."
"19524740","19527200"," I want to smash TLT down at all times. "
"19534990","19535690"," So what do I got to do?"
"19535910","19541490"," I got to be below 478 and 476 to print for the 26th."
"19542930","19543830"," Where is Quinn?"
"19544570","19546050"," Quinn wants Bitcoin down."
"19546050","19548410"," So Quinn, did you?"
"19549750","19552090"," Quinn will cut off his leg if you buy Bitcoin. "
"19552730","19553030"," That's hilarious."
"19556010","19556770"," That's how hilarious."
"19560300","19561220"," Yeah, let me see. "
"19561500","19562940"," Let me get a second here."
"19563200","19564360"," I'll bring up the Bitcoin map."
"19565820","19566940"," Hang tight here. "
"19567600","19569780"," I got to see what my Bitcoin connection is."
"19571460","19573460"," I'll bring up the Bitcoin map right now for you, brother."
"19576560","19577760"," Give me just a second. "
"19581020","19582180"," I got you covered."
"19585750","19588050"," Yeah, Tesla's carrying the market right now."
"19588950","19590750"," Tesla just does not care. "
"19595030","19597510"," I'm getting kicked off my other..."
"19598470","19600470"," I'm going to find something out here."
"19600650","19600790"," Hold on."
"19601050","19601370"," Book map. "
"19605190","19606630"," Free Bitcoin feed."
"19614020","19626180"," For some reason I don't have it loaded on this"
"19626180","19626700"," instance."
"19651390","19654610"," Yeah, what's the crypto data feed that's free for Book map?"
"19655470","19656390"," Does anybody know out there?"
"19656770","19660570"," For some reason I don't have it on this instance of Book map, but I'm running. "
"19670900","19672980"," These Tesla bulls just don't care."
"19674680","19675920"," Don't care at all."
"19678020","19679320"," Need to add a feed. "
"19689680","19691480"," No, I need not that feed."
"19692440","19693420"," CX is IQ."
"19693980","19694860"," Is it IQ feed?"
"19695100","19695940"," I think it's IQ feed. "
"19697640","19698680"," The IQ feed."
"19699860","19700340"," Okay."
"19702400","19702880"," Connections. "
"19705500","19706540"," Let me see here."
"19707580","19707900"," IQ feed."
"19709140","19712120"," I don't know why I'm getting weirded out with this IQ. "
"19712480","19714800"," I don't know why the IQ feed's not working for my Bitcoin."
"19716980","19721120"," Hey, what I'm going to do, Quinn, is I'm going to take a picture of it for you and send"
"19721120","19724160"," it to you where the real supports are end of day today."
"19724360","19724440"," Okay. "
"19724720","19728340"," I'll send it to you after 4 p.m. I apologize."
"19730440","19732980"," Do you think it's Gdax Henry?"
"19737990","19739030"," Is it Gdax?"
"19739230","19739710"," Maybe it is."
"19742910","19744270"," I'll remove that connection. "
"19745390","19746170"," Add connection."
"19749170","19750430"," I think it's Gdax."
"19755150","19755830"," Nope. "
"19756410","19757890"," I don't want rhythmic."
"19758790","19760030"," Remove the connection."
"19760370","19760630"," Okay. "
"19762070","19763690"," Let's see if it's Gdax."
"19770580","19771560"," Yeah, baby."
"19771740","19774240"," Let's see if we can get Gx feed. "
"19774840","19775260"," Gdax."
"19775680","19776440"," Oh, yeah."
"19777400","19778340"," Who called that out?"
"19778620","19780080"," Who called out Gdax out there?"
"19780240","19780440"," Rand?"
"19781780","19782620"," Call that out. "
"19782700","19784160"," There's a couple guys called that out, right?"
"19784840","19786380"," Who called out Gdax Justin?"
"19787100","19792840"," Justin called out Gdax Henry called out Gdax."
"19795080","19796740"," Hutch says he's fading out."
"19796880","19798800"," The test level is on spy right now. "
"19801000","19801480"," Terrible."
"19801860","19803660"," He looks like Quinn's got a friend here."
"19806540","19807740"," All right, Quinn. "
"19807800","19808100"," You ready?"
"19808640","19810400"," Quinn, didn't we call the $40,000?"
"19811000","19816060"," Didn't we call $40,000 a bounce the other day on this book map?"
"19817220","19818180"," I swore we did, bro."
"19819620","19822460"," I swore we called out the $40,000 bounce."
"19823240","19823380"," All right. "
"19823520","19824360"," So let that one load."
"19824840","19828100"," We'll come back to in just a minute."
"19828920","19832140"," Tesla bull saying you ain't fading shit today. "
"19833360","19835220"," You ain't fading shit."
"19835940","19837820"," We're getting above 11 to 11 10."
"19838220","19839540"," We're going to 11 15. "
"19839920","19841880"," Oh, it looks like the sellers have come down a little bit."
"19843140","19844860"," Sellers are pouring down from above."
"19845640","19846360"," They're all angry. "
"19846700","19847180"," They're stinky."
"19847180","19848520"," They're coming down."
"19848600","19851080"," They were at 11 20 and now they're now they're coming down. "
"19852500","19853700"," They got poopy diapers."
"19854240","19855160"," Got chains are diapers."
"19855760","19860340"," Got a little bit of sellers coming down here at 11 14, but the big boys are up at 11"
"19860340","19860920"," 20. "
"19861980","19863120"," But it doesn't matter."
"19863640","19864520"," Look at these bulls."
"19865260","19866820"," These bulls don't care. "
"19867400","19868800"," Hero indicator off the charts."
"19869460","19872720"," You got buyers absorbing sellers."
"19876020","19879320"," We're going to let the book by our Bitcoin load right now. "
"19880300","19881260"," You leaked it, Quinn."
"19882080","19884040"," But do you remember when you and I are looking at it last week?"
"19884660","19889520"," Do you remember when you and I are looking at Bitcoin and the and Bitcoin showed that showed that"
"19889520","19891060"," support level at 40,000?"
"19891440","19905460"," And you're sure that shit attacked it, didn't"
"19905460","19905460"," it?"
"19905460","19907400"," A bunch of secret bears in here."
"19910680","19915080"," I'm out here getting short this morning and the bears are too afraid to get short with me. "
"19915340","19916640"," Some got short with me."
"19916820","19919060"," They made some sick bank this morning."
"19919880","19922320"," Bears are just waiting to sell this shit this morning. "
"19924080","19928020"," Bears just in the background being like, is he going to call it or no?"
"19928760","19929900"," Are we going short or no?"
"19931300","19933400"," But we made some good money going short this morning."
"19937180","19938080"," What do we got here?"
"19938200","19941380"," Look at the bulls are just stepping it up."
"19942380","19944600"," Let's see if we can style Quinn out here. "
"19946200","19948560"," Got to load so much information here for Quinn."
"19950000","19951460"," It's never that easy, is it?"
"19955100","19956760"," It's like Bitcoin doesn't want to load."
"19957200","19957900"," Okay, Quinn, you ready?"
"19960340","19962480"," That's what you want to see Quinn, my brother. "
"19963500","19964800"," Quinn, you've got sellers."
"19964800","19966940"," Hiding at $4425."
"19967760","19970240"," Sellers hiding at $45,500. "
"19972760","19974600"," Do you have any trap buyers above?"
"19975640","19983280"," There's all your trap buyers Quinn, $48,000, $47 or $5,000, $4725."
"19985100","19986080"," Bears love seeing this shit."
"19988440","19990360"," Bears want to see where everything is. "
"19991260","19992560"," Bears want to know what's up."
"19996720","19998360"," Looking down below, right?"
"19998500","20000060"," We're going to look down below in here."
"20000900","20002920"," You've got a light support on Bitcoin. "
"20004720","20007660"," You know, the bottom here on Bitcoin has moved up."
"20007840","20012760"," It's got, oh, it's got $40,000, $39,000, $39,000."
"20013100","20014620"," This is different than before. "
"20014840","20018060"," There's a light support here at $41,000."
"20019880","20021380"," You want to go deeper, Quinn?"
"20022880","20030080"," You want to see where, like, oh, that's the, there's the grand prize right there, right here."
"20031100","20031420"," Ready?"
"20032180","20036220"," Price target, Bitcoin, $38,046. "
"20037280","20040640"," Give me one ping, Quinn, one ping only."
"20041660","20047460"," There you go, there's another juicy one, $36,000 on Bitcoin."
"20048640","20051360"," You know the Bitcoin, oh, there's a bad boy down there. "
"20053100","20054100"," $35,000."
"20054740","20057380"," Another algo trigger, way down there."
"20058160","20060040"," Quinn's getting all fired up right now. "
"20060140","20064400"," He's going to pause this video, go back and start marking all this shit down."
"20065200","20066820"," And he's going to launch the torpedoes."
"20072900","20075240"," So Tesla's got some nice support building here. "
"20075560","20078080"," When you see a structure like this building, this is good for Tesla."
"20078760","20080660"," We all know that Tesla can trade crazy."
"20080660","20083280"," You can lose 100 points in a day and gain 100 points. "
"20083700","20086280"," But this is very solid heading into the close right now."
"20087640","20089200"," Good to see this move right here."
"20090400","20100660"," Trading down right now you want to see, you want to see if Tesla can hold this $11.06. You"
"20100660","20105440"," want to see if Tesla gang has the balls to hold this. "
"20105600","20111300"," If they don't hold this, if you guys want to know where the next support is for Tesla, see this"
"20111300","20111680"," right here."
"20112760","20122140"," This support disappeared and it raised itself up to $11.06. Good to see."
"20122480","20127980"," If we start selling off into the close or if you're afraid as to where we wind up tomorrow, you're"
"20127980","20135220"," looking at the real money is down at $10.80, $10.70, $10.65. And I'm assuming this run came"
"20135220","20136520"," from that $10.50 mark. "
"20139070","20140110"," That they're down here."
"20147320","20151360"," $10.65. So it looks like, remember this major support down here at $10.50?"
"20151660","20153120"," Looks like it's moved up a little bit."
"20153560","20156420"," Like this sitting up here now at $10.68. This is all nice to see. "
"20157080","20158720"," $10.80. This is really nice."
"20159160","20160300"," I like this a lot."
"20161120","20165760"," Because remember they were down at $1,100, $1,120. "
"20165760","20171060"," Then $10.50. And you're starting to..."
"20171060","20173100"," Oh, we lost the GDAX connection."
"20174260","20175480"," We've probably gotten in trouble."
"20175720","20177200"," Maybe I wonder if..."
"20177550","20182220"," I wonder if PAMP just cut me off from the GDAX feed. "
"20185060","20186020"," Go Tesla."
"20189960","20192860"," Time frame, when that possible, $38,000 Bitcoin."
"20192860","20195480"," You get the Bitcoin bears in here. "
"20196020","20197140"," Get them all fired up."
"20197680","20203240"," Get the Bitcoin bears on fire inside the feed of like 5,000 viewers."
"20209960","20212160"," Quinn, huge buyers at zero. "
"20213160","20215080"," What was Quinn saying yesterday?"
"20215740","20217560"," Quinn was saying..."
"20218420","20220860"," Quinn was saying yesterday..."
"20220860","20224980"," We'll launch the digital dollar and you burn your..."
"20224980","20230120"," No, you burn your dollar bills live on a cam feed or something on your phone, right?"
"20230480","20237060"," You take your dollar bills, you burn them on your camera phone, and then the government will give"
"20237060","20239380"," you digital dollar bills."
"20241580","20242620"," I love it."
"20244060","20245080"," I love it. "
"20249440","20252100"," I demand for $68 before the bell today."
"20253460","20255800"," Demand for $68 on the..."
"20255800","20256240"," on the spy."
"20265180","20268840"," Look at Euro Boomer stepping in, just giving up Tesla bills. "
"20269880","20271020"," Spy bears are hungry here."
"20271500","20272220"," I know, me too."
"20272400","20273080"," I'm a super hungry. "
"20273620","20275220"," I want my F in 468."
"20276200","20277580"," I want that sell off into the clothes."
"20278820","20279300"," Bad. "
"20280300","20281260"," I'm still short here."
"20283140","20284780"," So, I'm usually the..."
"20284780","20287540"," I'm usually a bull here and I'm still F in short."
"20288640","20289980"," I want my blood. "
"20290600","20291600"," I want my fat."
"20296100","20301280"," Can you need code on phone to ensure the bill and you be burned then burn live on phone video?"
"20304680","20309640"," I have nothing against Bitcoin bros and Bitcoin Maxis as Quinn calls them."
"20311100","20312340"," Yeah, Quinn has an F."
"20312600","20313220"," It's technical. "
"20315100","20317520"," But I do fear."
"20317880","20322680"," The one thing, the fear that I have is, you know, you can see like middle America."
"20323660","20325120"," You can see like the government. "
"20325320","20328280"," You can see some, you know, they'll roll out a..."
"20328280","20330860"," I forget what his name is, but the guy that really hates Bitcoin."
"20331140","20334280"," They roll his ass out one day and, you know, they just scare you."
"20335140","20342500"," And it's like, you have 60 days or 90 days to turn your Bitcoin over to the digital dollar. "
"20342500","20347480"," And you know you'll see like half of America flip just on that right there alone."
"20349160","20350020"," And just panic."
"20350200","20353320"," Panic seller Bitcoin by the digital dollar. "
"20353820","20355720"," It would be something stupid and insane."
"20357740","20359280"," And that's really all they have to do."
"20359420","20360580"," That's really all they have to do. "
"20361140","20363040"," You know, and you'll just panic enough people right away."
"20363520","20365020"," You crash Bitcoin like crazy."
"20365720","20366060"," You'd be insane. "
"20371450","20373190"," Oh, we got to head and shoulders in the one minute."
"20373770","20374530"," Peter Schiff."
"20375610","20376390"," Peter Schiff. "
"20376650","20377790"," Everybody's pumping Peter Schiff."
"20379570","20380270"," Love it."
"20380930","20382950"," Turn the bulls and the bears for one day. "
"20383550","20385010"," Make them all a bunch of sickos."
"20391080","20393080"," Am I going to get my 468 or what?"
"20397000","20398500"," Give me my 468 minimum."
"20398720","20399240"," That's all I want. "
"20399440","20400380"," Just want a 468."
"20401040","20401460"," Want that?"
"20401800","20403480"," Oh, I do want you guys to see this, okay?"
"20404000","20404620"," This is important."
"20409780","20413880"," Looks like the buyers are disappearing down here or they did buy the dip on spy. "
"20415580","20417500"," Is there some call flow coming in right now?"
"20418700","20420620"," Well, you guys see this down here."
"20423680","20424480"," This is important."
"20428840","20429280"," Goddamn. "
"20430360","20433480"," I wonder if we have to sell my puts and buy some calls in the close here."
"20435300","20438420"," This is an interesting turn of events right now on the spy."
"20438420","20440700"," I do want you to see that. "
"20442440","20443560"," Wait a minute here."
"20444280","20445460"," Be close to look here."
"20449360","20450660"," Wait a minute here. "
"20451820","20453280"," You guys see this right here?"
"20456500","20459980"," Looks like these buyers are stepping in on the spy."
"20460220","20460440"," They are."
"20461100","20462900"," So just a heads up right now. "
"20463180","20471460"," If you are a spy bear, that it looks like those buyers stepped right up from 468 and they're"
"20471460","20475040"," currently got a buy program going on on the spy right now."
"20497210","20499650"," Sweet made some quick profit on my spy puts."
"20500470","20502350"," So I am no longer short right now. "
"20505010","20509750"," There is a buy program on right now."
"20509810","20512690"," I don't know why there is, but there is a buy program right now on the spy."
"20514190","20516710"," There are currently some spy puts coming in. "
"20517190","20519690"," There are some VIX calls coming in right now."
"20520270","20524810"," There are some calls coming in on AAL right now, but I must warn you if you are a bear"
"20525490","20528630"," that I don't know if you're going to get screwed into the close right now."
"20529130","20529430"," I'm unsure. "
"20531050","20535090"," I closed my shorts because I don't want to get caught up in this one."
"20535170","20536250"," Take the profit and run right now."
"20536870","20538110"," Speak conscience of that. "
"20538330","20541410"," I was expecting us to sell off into the close on the spy."
"20542070","20543990"," But I'm unsure at the moment."
"20546560","20548160"," I'm getting some mixed messages here. "
"20558780","20565180"," I might end up taking some calls at some point here, either now or at the bell."
"20566200","20570300"," So if you guys want to pay for trade this out there, I'll have something for you."
"20571720","20574320"," And we've got really mixed messages, right?"
"20574500","20576380"," The hero indicator is showing negative on the spy. "
"20577420","20580280"," But I don't like seeing this right here."
"20580280","20583720"," I don't like seeing the buyers stepping up."
"20583720","20584500"," You can see them. "
"20585200","20587240"," See back here on the left-hand side here?"
"20587240","20587760"," Are these buyers?"
"20589000","20592300"," They swooped right up and stepped right in here."
"20595190","20601650"," And so that makes me wonder about where the dip is below if the buyers have disappeared from 450."
"20605730","20606750"," They're now higher. "
"20606990","20608110"," They're now at 4th."
"20608430","20608810"," Wait a minute."
"20609850","20612910"," Now they're still down here, but a lot of these buyers have stepped up. "
"20631400","20633440"," And the buyers swooped right in there for a minute."
"20640260","20641020"," I agree with that."
"20641220","20642620"," VIX-18 is the new 13. "
"20644560","20645840"," Yavin or I was cash."
"20647000","20650180"," I sold my calls and then I picked up some put spreads."
"20653280","20655680"," Hey, those Alex, those 480Cs. "
"20656140","20657200"," When did you pick them up for?"
"20658820","20660360"," When are they expiring?"
"20666320","20667180"," Yeah, hutch."
"20667240","20667820"," I got your brother."
"20669280","20670260"," One of those four. "
"20670400","20674240"," I don't think we'd go to 480, but someone thinks we're going to 478."
"20674940","20676240"," Where's those calls at?"
"20679660","20681760"," We're those 478s."
"20682620","20685200"," 128, 121, 478. "
"20685720","20687620"," I don't believe that for a frickin' second."
"20689480","20690600"," Let's see that shit."
"20694020","20695300"," They're still in them too. "
"20696300","20706280"," Somebody's in January 21st, 478C at $1.05. $1.04. That's"
"20706280","20706400"," insane."
"20709580","20711160"," We got some news I don't know about."
"20721510","20724770"," So you made a good entrance and you'll be out at 15% or 15% yet. "
"20726330","20728750"," Bump my puts to 26 cents to get the fill."
"20729330","20730990"," Yeah, let me know what you guys are trading into the close."
"20732090","20734070"," We're coming into the three o'clock hour right now. "
"20734110","20735110"," We've got eight minutes left."
"20736990","20739110"," I don't know what you guys are doing into the close here."
"20741210","20743530"," And it looks like we got a buy program kicking in. "
"20744590","20749970"," We still have more sellers than buyers, but this that we saw that support."
"20750710","20752890"," You guys see this support over here, right?"
"20753130","20760510"," We had buyers sitting down below here at 468 and they literally swooped up and tagged."
"20761250","20766090"," So when I see a move like that, you know, these guys right here. "
"20766230","20767210"," See these guys right here?"
"20768110","20771750"," These guys were much lower and they came much higher."
"20772550","20775230"," And so I want to know why, okay?"
"20776770","20778270"," Just like that it changed."
"20795900","20798460"," You got Tesla bashing around up here. "
"20799660","20803000"," And I never like Tesla like doing this into the close as ever."
"20803360","20804920"," I hate it."
"20805760","20808360"," I like when they rip up into the end of a close or they sell down. "
"20808580","20809600"," They never seem to just trade."
"20810040","20812720"," How many times does Tesla trade sideways into a close?"
"20814140","20814560"," Ever?"
"20816200","20820140"," Well, I guess sometimes they're doing the lows, but never on the highs."
"20825780","20827080"," What are you guys staying over here?"
"20832460","20836600"," By January expiration makes sense to me and then tank it into FOMC. "
"20837380","20843520"," Yeah, Winky, maybe they're putting the 21 date on there just to give them some intrinsic value on"
"20843520","20843940"," those calls."
"20846680","20850740"," You know what I'm saying, Winky, maybe they're pulling the 21s to deal with some sideways action."
"20852980","20854480"," Then tank it in FOMC. "
"20857420","20859580"," Well, he's in for 65 cents."
"20862900","20865760"," My 480 C's will die worth us so we don't gap up."
"20869880","20870900"," Oh, we're gapping. "
"20871580","20872520"," We're on a buy program."
"20874440","20877320"," You're probably going to have to sell them though sooner."
"20879260","20882300"," I'm not going to expect for 78 today. "
"20883120","20884000"," I think that's happening."
"20884000","20884980"," That ain't happening."
"20891250","20892410"," But either way, right?"
"20892610","20893390"," It doesn't really matter. "
"20894170","20898170"," So we're either going to be trading up into the close or going to be trading down into the close."
"20899210","20901630"," Let me see where the bots are at."
"20904130","20904810"," Oh, yeah. "
"20905710","20907910"," You know the bots are on still."
"20908270","20910570"," The bots are still on 472s."
"20910570","20914950"," So maybe we close out the day at 472. "
"20923240","20925460"," Look for us, the tag 472."
"20926280","20927420"," Close to it."
"20935080","20937240"," Winky's saying 474s Max Payne. "
"20937780","20940540"," We have a bunch of call spreads on 472."
"20941340","20942000"," Whole bunch."
"20946300","20950480"," Whole bunch of call spreads expiring at 471. "
"20950480","20950900"," 471."
"20953760","20956800"," Where are the call spreads expiring on the spy?"
"20958860","20963620"," Got them expiring at 470 and 472."
"20965140","20966700"," So they want to print those, right?"
"20967000","20969980"," The banks want to print their spreads no matter what happens today. "
"20974290","20976430"," Lots of American airline calls."
"20977030","20978090"," Lots of BA calls."
"20979530","20980350"," Jet blue calls. "
"20981490","20982990"," Into the close today."
"20984530","20987090"," Did BA sell off today in Jet Blue?"
"20988190","20989010"," Jay Blue?"
"20990490","20991510"," Jay Blue?"
"20993510","20994790"," Ooh, I like that trade."
"20995470","20998210"," So just to heads up, guys, in all this panic, right?"
"20998770","21000870"," Someone's buying Jet Blue calls. "
"21001870","21002910"," And it's sold off."
"21003930","21005170"," So Jet Blue, right?"
"21005830","21006530"," This is actually a good trade."
"21007130","21014150"," If you take this trade, date them longer out, because they tend to screw you on these trades on the"
"21014150","21014290"," airlines. "
"21015130","21016630"," You have to date them like a month later."
"21018190","21019730"," So make them like March 18th."
"21020370","21021590"," Jet Blue, 16C. "
"21023190","21026810"," $74,000 expiring February 18th."
"21027550","21029790"," Jet Blue, February 18th, 16C."
"21029790","21031350"," $74,000. "
"21031770","21040190"," American Airlines, January 14th, 19C and 18.5C, 15 grand and 22 grand each."
"21040690","21041350"," Respectable."
"21042210","21048150"," BA January 14th, 217 and a half C for 75 grand. "
"21048330","21053290"," You guys know how these like BA trades like BA and Disney will trade down all day long?"
"21053850","21055730"," And then they bought them out at the bell."
"21055730","21061210"," And then the next day they rip like 1.5% until like 9.32 in the morning."
"21062110","21063770"," And then everybody takes their money and they run. "
"21076980","21077660"," Look at that."
"21078060","21079460"," Tesla just doesn't care."
"21080860","21090740"," 11.13. 11.12. Light resistance above at 11.20. Next target above 11 "
"21090740","21094940",".50. 11.4868 to be exact. "
"21094940","21098340"," You guys need to buy like 1200 C calls."
"21098560","21099140"," How much does those cost?"
"21099960","21101220"," Tesla 1200 calls?"
"21104110","21105830"," Tesla, Tesla."
"21109850","21112990"," Earnings date is on the in between the 21st. "
"21113990","21115590"," Oh, yeah, look at that, dude."
"21116830","21123370"," 1200 C, only $1.87 for January 14th."
"21123890","21128310"," $1.87. You buy the 1300s. "
"21129010","21130430"," Nobody's even buying them."
"21130630","21132930"," They're 28 cents for the 14th."
"21133910","21135310"," Nobody's even buying them. "
"21135590","21137150"," You guys got no balls, no moxie."
"21139770","21141130"," January 21st."
"21141290","21144130"," 1200 C already 12 bucks. "
"21144830","21145130"," Whoo!"
"21146570","21147250"," Expansive."
"21149050","21151670"," 1300 C, $3 a piece."
"21154030","21155030"," Tell you what. "
"21157410","21158570"," Man, I like that."
"21158790","21160230"," I like that 1200 C."
"21160890","21164530"," It's only $1.88. It's kind of cheap."
"21165890","21166570"," What do we got?"
"21166830","21168130"," Two more days to put on 100 points. "
"21172720","21175000"," Imagine putting on another 100 points on Tesla."
"21175580","21176920"," Not even 80 points."
"21177680","21179320"," Throw another 80 points on Tesla. "
"21180240","21180820"," Ready for this?"
"21181020","21187050"," If you throw another 80 points on Tesla, who will you make?"
"21189790","21195170"," Make something like 10 bucks, like 500%."
"21196830","21199810"," You need like a whale to come in, like a soft bank to come in."
"21202230","21204870"," You like soft bank can just rip at 1200. "
"21213560","21215300"," It's pretty degenerate, isn't it?"
"21215900","21220700"," Hot, hot, hot."
"21222320","21224580"," He's coming to generate Captain Jim James."
"21229260","21230420"," There's still hope, right?"
"21230580","21231280"," We got one more day. "
"21231540","21232300"," Like we got Thursday."
"21233120","21233820"," We got Friday."
"21239860","21241060"," Problem is that. "
"21243820","21249020"," Problem is that, like, let's say they, let's say they, let's say they murder us on Thursday because"
"21249020","21249840"," there's no OPEX."
"21250860","21252580"," Although Thursday's are usually good days."
"21252840","21255940"," Thursday's are usually pretty solid runner days. "
"21256740","21257580"," Look at this."
"21257680","21259000"," Look at this spy."
"21259760","21260620"," Look at these dealers. "
"21260940","21262740"," They're just wrecking everything into the clothes."
"21263480","21264440"," The dealers are scumbags."
"21266860","21268200"," Look at this right here. "
"21268980","21270140"," The dealers are savages."
"21272420","21273540"," Straight savages."
"21275040","21276540"," Dealers are like no more playing. "
"21277640","21279000"," Casino closed early."
"21280080","21281420"," We're going to take all your money."
"21284680","21285980"," Casino closed, buddy. "
"21287000","21288300"," No casino for you today."
"21290620","21292540"," We're going to put, they're going to park it, right?"
"21294200","21297420"," Probably going to park this bitch right between 470 and 472."
"21298360","21303320"," Some of the calls are dealers are like, they're going to pay these spreads off. "
"21304060","21305420"," No messing around."
"21307180","21311560"," A bunch of degenerates trying to play with our calls and puts into the clothes."
"21314420","21315200"," Scram kid. "
"21324520","21325560"," It's all our money."
"21326280","21328120"," We're taking our cut from the spreads from the banks."
"21328920","21332180"," A bunch of degenerates from Wall Street Bets can't take our money. "
"21333060","21333800"," We're smarter than you."
"21341940","21343440"," These guys are savages."
"21345180","21351560"," Watch them try to park this shit to like 470 just below and in the last minute they wrap, rake"
"21351560","21352600"," it up to 472. "
"21354440","21356680"," I'm interested to take one of these trades here at the end."
"21357580","21363020"," Even if I only hold it for like a minute or two, right before the bell, do not ever hold"
"21363020","21366420"," a zero date in past the bell ever, ever, ever."
"21366540","21367560"," Well, I guess you can sometimes. "
"21368240","21371700"," They can print somewhat, but I don't ever do it too dangerous."
"21374680","21380580"," So it's 3 p.m. Banks stepped in and so the market makers stepped in and said, no, we're not"
"21380580","21381960"," going to 472 now."
"21384180","21389580"," They said they're going to park it like Sully parks the plane in the Hudson River and that the last"
"21389580","21392320"," minute when no one's paying attention, we're going to run it up, I think. "
"21394320","21396140"," I'm getting some calls ready."
"21406460","21410060"," They burned those 472s there like 26 cents."
"21410780","21418220"," Now they're down to like 13 cents each, stripped them of 100% of their value or 50% of"
"21418220","21418620"," their value. "
"21420140","21422760"," So I might try to sneak in these calls here."
"21426020","21431240"," So I'm buying a rack of, I'm going to buy a rack of 472c."
"21445790","21455490"," So if you look at the January 12th, 472c, do not buy them right now. "
"21456050","21458190"," But they're at like 12 cents."
"21458350","21460870"," They're at like 26 cents just 10 minutes ago."
"21461610","21463530"," So they just raked them down to nothing. "
"21463530","21468590"," But I want you to look at the corresponding side on the put side."
"21469830","21473910"," The 470ps are worth 49 cents."
"21474510","21476270"," Now they're worth 53 cents. "
"21477190","21481990"," And so there's a concentration of the column put side."
"21482410","21487810"," I just want you to pay attention to the money flow that's pouring into the put side right now at"
"21487810","21488690"," 470c."
"21498360","21504220"," Excuse me, 470c and 470p, the put side. "
"21505160","21508780"," And then I want you to watch the chain on the other side on the call side."
"21509580","21511420"," And you can see these calls are just being murdered."
"21512100","21512840"," They're at 12 cents. "
"21513140","21514080"," Now they're at 8 cents."
"21515940","21517560"," And look what's increasing in value."
"21518460","21523220"," The put side, 470p just keeps going up and up and up in value. "
"21527380","21528780"," They're at 48 cents."
"21529060","21530420"," Now they're at 55 cents."
"21530840","21532760"," They're at 58 cents for a minute. "
"21536880","21538340"," And just watch that options chain."
"21540720","21552360"," And you"
"21552360","21554520"," start to get a comfortable with this option chain."
"21554660","21558080"," You want to see it like go down to 5 cents, 6 cents. "
"21559420","21562760"," Slam that buy button and it comes back up to 10 cents."
"21562940","21565700"," You make 100% profit and you sell them on a flip."
"21566340","21567860"," You might hold them for like 30 seconds. "
"21569620","21575580"," Look to see 472 come down to like 6 cents or so, 8 cents, 5 cents."
"21576460","21581540"," If it happens for a brief moment, sometimes you can go in buy them for 5 cents by a rack."
"21582320","21585540"," And then you sell them right away at 9 or 10 cents. "
"21586820","21588000"," That's 100% trade."
"21605490","21606970"," I might buy a rack myself."
"21607730","21608210"," Hold on here. "
"21611060","21612560"," Nope, not quite yet."
"21635570","21637970"," This is degenerate behavior I'm doing right now."
"21640360","21641160"," Just patience. "
"21643360","21644940"," Now they're killing the put side."
"21645140","21646340"," They're at 58 cents."
"21646580","21647220"," Now they're down to 46. "
"21656100","21656500"," Patience."
"21658720","21664400"," If they don't park this right into the clothes, if they try to run it up to 470, 472 or"
"21664400","21667040"," anything like that, I might be able to make a quick run on it."
"21677490","21679150"," Bob Walsh, buy a rack. "
"21682820","21684780"," No, no, don't buy them at 10 cents."
"21685020","21686860"," Any guys out there buying at 10 cents?"
"21687520","21688540"," You guys are crazy."
"21690580","21692660"," Cap might want to hold off until I sell. "
"21694360","21694820"," That's 100."
"21695160","21696440"," Buy them at 100 apiece."
"21697280","21698780"," You can only buy 300 at a time. "
"21700200","21701400"," Oh, yeah, I'll look at Tesla right now."
"21702440","21703280"," There you go."
"21706700","21707880"," There's a Tesla feed. "
"21713200","21714720"," Tesla's killing it into the clothes."
"21717140","21718480"," Come on, give me that dip."
"21719400","21720760"," Give me that dip on the spy. "
"21721360","21723220"," Give me like that 6 cent call on the spy."
"21726180","21727200"," Tesla's just chilling."
"21728360","21729700"," It's not selling off into the clothes. "
"21733480","21734560"," Just hanging out."
"21736640","21738700"," There goes your dip buyers down below at 1080."
"21739920","21740660"," Come on down. "
"21741300","21742720"," Come on down, spy."
"21743300","21744860"," Maybe spy sells off into the bell."
"21745400","21747460"," Maybe we were right all along where they are going to sell it down. "
"21751940","21753020"," Maybe they do sell this."
"21753240","21754740"," Maybe they do sell it down into the bell."
"21757980","21761500"," I'm going to have to switch over to Friday calls. "
"21762280","21763300"," I hate when Thursday."
"21763300","21768720"," You guys ever see when Thursday just bleeds and we burn the place down or we burn the place down"
"21768720","21769120"," on Fridays?"
"21769640","21770420"," That's terrible too."
"21777950","21779290"," Wouldn't that be hilarious, Winky?"
"21780910","21784030"," If the market closes with those in the money and they do the exercise?"
"21790530","21795470"," We make some legitimate trades, but then we get degenerate with our winnings and lose it all. "
"21796270","21799270"," We place DJ and trades in the last five minutes of the bell."
"21802640","21809540"," When a bunch of money is normal, like upstanding, like monical wearing, tuxedo wearing, traders and"
"21809540","21813320"," investors and then we come around at the end of the day and we're like, hmm."
"21814380","21816560"," We've got some zero dates expiring today. "
"21817400","21821460"," I wonder if I can get them down to like three cents and they'll trade up to 10 cents in"
"21821460","21821980"," five minutes."
"21825480","21831240"," I sneak in and steal the bank money from them."
"21837200","21838920"," They're going to try to park this, aren't they?"
"21840900","21844840"," Yeah, it's really weird. "
"21845040","21851060"," They used to crash the VIX clockwork on Fridays."
"21851720","21857140"," And recently it's like flipping a coin."
"21862400","21864180"," It's been like straight flipping a coin. "
"21866800","21869460"," Yeah, it's been tough to find."
"21869960","21874220"," They're really like they're dumping the market at least on Thursday and Fridays now."
"21875740","21879560"," Like if we don't dump on Thursday, it's coming on Friday in my view. "
"21879560","21882000"," It used to be pretty consistent."
"21885900","21887620"," Yeah, I went and bought nothing yet."
"21889380","21890460"," It ain't looking good. "
"21893800","21899060"," So watching ES prints the end of day at the money and Q ES in a triangle."
"21905510","21908190"," Tesla bulls are kind of trapped and committed at this point."
"21911110","21913670"," Let me look at the flow and see what they're talking about. "
"21913930","21914530"," Oh, shit."
"21916010","21922010"," AMC March 18th, 23 p 1.4 million dollars."
"21923190","21926110"," Let's talk to you guys about some of the flow coming through. "
"21927290","21934510"," QQQ 390 C $73,000 kind of inconsequential DT."
"21935270","21937230"," Remember we talked about DT this morning?"
"21937970","21939650"," Remember, remember good old DT?"
"21940410","21943650"," We brought that was one right off the bell this morning, right?"
"21943830","21944270"," Dynatrace."
"21945090","21948110"," We have more calls coming in on Dynatrace. "
"21950620","21952760"," More calls coming in on Dynatrace."
"21955280","21957460"," Someone keeps buying the Dynatrace dip."
"21957980","21960040"," Those are follow ups too. "
"21960560","21960820"," Ready?"
"21961100","21962160"," So this is a neat one."
"21963020","21965500"," We've seen a lot of Dynatrace calls coming in."
"21965500","21968220"," They ripped in the middle of the afternoon today and then sold off. "
"21969040","21976780"," But they have some more calls coming in May 20th, 65 C for $239,000."
"21978280","21987500"," Palantir, Palantir, they're trading one January 20th, 22 C for $118,000."
"21987500","21996600"," We've got some Donkey Kong calls February 18th, DKNG, $125,000 C."
"21998100","22002720"," But they don't really score high in the algo that the DKNG calls. "
"22008740","22013560"," If you're a bear out there, there's some high algo score puts on."
"22016410","22017250"," Where did I see that?"
"22020890","22023530"," Where did I see those puts or high algo score?"
"22024490","22028770"," Did they disappear?"
"22031410","22040730"," XME X-ray, Mike Echo, January 28th, 45.5 P, $239,000."
"22042630","22043570"," XME. "
"22046910","22049590"," Watching more airlines calls coming in."
"22051550","22055970"," Got FCX coming in, calls 136,000."
"22056690","22059030"," For February 18th, 45 C."
"22060550","22060810"," JetBlue. "
"22061750","22066670"," More calls January 20th, 22 C for $38,000."
"22067470","22070710"," AMC, that's a golden ticket on 23 P."
"22071930","22073570"," It's got to piss off the apes."
"22075430","22080020"," It's got to piss off the apes. "
"22082820","22085380"," The owner of AMC loans out his share."
"22085500","22087500"," The owner of AMC owns his shares of $3."
"22088760","22090660"," He's just loaning him out for people to short. "
"22093900","22098340"," Never understood the bedmates between GME and AMC."
"22104240","22106080"," I'll bring up the AMC chart for you guys."
"22106660","22109300"," Some of you guys have some ape friends out there. "
"22109300","22111320"," So we'll take a look at that for you guys."
"22111540","22112640"," I do have a soft spot."
"22112640","22114060"," I don't trade this stuff anymore. "
"22114900","22117160"," But I do understand you guys want to see."
"22118120","22119420"," I know you guys want to know."
"22122440","22124260"," I got some good friends that like that stuff. "
"22124980","22126580"," So I'll show you guys AMC."
"22127680","22129920"," You had a golden ticket come in for puts at 23."
"22131040","22132340"," The intent is to pin it. "
"22135450","22137070"," I'll show you guys where the buy the dippers are."
"22139090","22141070"," Where your real support is right now."
"22142350","22143110"," Okay, ready?"
"22143830","22149410"," So see down here $6.84. I think that's the owner of AMC if I had to guess. "
"22157440","22160660"," All kinds of sellers above right now are pinning action."
"22162580","22172300"," Right now you're looking at 22.08. 22.08 and then"
"22172300","22177520"," 20.06. Pass that along to your Wall Street bet friends."
"22178340","22178940"," Okay. "
"22179760","22184560"," 22.08 and 20.06 on AMC."
"22194400","22197520"," And there was just a lot of money put on AMC."
"22201700","22204140"," Tesla's just kind of rattling around doing its thing. "
"22204820","22208200"," Making its ER run so they can sell bags too."
"22208660","22212140"," You'll see all the positive news coming out on Tesla at some point."
"22212760","22217000"," Hit like 1150 or 1200 banging news to come out. "
"22217220","22219520"," All the old school bulls will sell all the new bulls."
"22220160","22221960"," New bulls will be bag holding."
"22230400","22243100"," You know"
"22243100","22243320"," what?"
"22253830","22255170"," I'm going to wait for the bell. "
"22255550","22257690"," I'm probably going to throw away some money today."
"22258470","22262810"," I'm probably going to buy shit."
"22262950","22264630"," Should I buy more calls into the clothes?"
"22274900","22276380"," Commodities are blooming. "
"22277580","22279600"," Commodities are a great trade right now."
"22279900","22280380"," I like commodities."
"22282900","22290020"," AMC numbers are $20.06. That's your hard support. "
"22290860","22292760"," And was it $20.06?"
"22293180","22293920"," I think it was $20."
"22294740","22298340"," Was it a $22.08?"
"22299640","22302420"," $22.08 is light support."
"22303180","22306120"," You can call that like S2 and S3. "
"22307040","22309700"," So S1 right now is the rear right on S1."
"22310080","22317740"," $22.86, S2 is $22.08. And $20.06 is S3."
"22318340","22320860"," You had a golden ticket put option come out. "
"22322360","22329070"," They just bought $1.4 million expiring on March"
"22329070","22338120"," 18th on AMC."
"22340100","22341800"," I like commodities right now."
"22353710","22358090"," But if they lose 1,200 C that we're going to buy up or $0.20 already. "
"22360110","22363370"," Yeah, I haven't bought any calls yet."
"22363510","22364010"," I bought nothing."
"22365730","22371450"," I'm cash gang right now closed out my short positions, closed out my lungs from this morning. "

"22381080","22387040"," I like, what's the, what's the Vanguard value?"
"22389800","22391200"," What's the Vanguard value?"
"22393380","22397160"," You know, that guy from, you know, it's funny too, is that Vanguard value trade and that ETF. "
"22397900","22400660"," There was a guy, there's a famous guy from New Mexico from Albuquerque."
"22401420","22403220"," He was talking about that shit like a month ago."
"22404440","22406620"," And I blew him off and I never should have. "
"22406720","22407440"," I lost a lot of money."
"22407640","22414920"," I even, I even downloaded or bookmarked that guy's video and wanted to trade that."
"22414920","22416680"," And I didn't trade that Vanguard fund. "
"22416680","22417700"," I was kind of pissed to myself."
"22418880","22420020"," I'm not picking that up."
"22431560","22432800"," Yeah, he was a golden ticket. "
"22433360","22435740"," You guys are talking about the put, the golden ticket puts on AMC."
"22438300","22440660"," Yeah, hey, Zeus, I'll show you CLF."
"22442580","22447260"," Are you talking about futures CLF or the cash market?"
"22448560","22462230"," I'm talking about oil, not oil. "
"22463310","22467330"," Which one is CL, CLF is, is that oil?"
"22468110","22469070"," I'm looking for here."
"22473890","22474690"," I'm getting tired here."
"22474770","22476010"," It's late, late, late in the day. "
"22484510","22486190"," More buyers than sellers on CLF."
"22489380","22494820"," If you're, if your buyers disappear, hey, Zeus, you're liable to fall down pretty steep, right?"
"22494820","22496640"," Get some by the difference of $20."
"22497500","22498880"," You want to be careful. "
"22499720","22507940"," I would pick this trade up once you get above $23.39. Take it to $25.83. Wait until you"
"22507940","22508560"," get over here."
"22518740","22520320"," Yeah, Cleveland Cliffs, Cliffs."
"22521300","22522060"," I like Vale too. "
"22524320","22525400"," CLF is a metal bender."
"22526300","22526640"," Steel bender."
"22528880","22531260"," Hotch is diamond-handed and puts right now. "
"22531260","22533720"," He wants to see that sell-off right into clothes."
"22541310","22542430"," Chop, chop, chop."
"22542770","22543010"," I agree. "
"22545090","22547250"," Some TQQ puts."
"22549250","22555950"," January 14th, $193,000, 152.5 P."
"22562390","22564930"," TQQQ puts puts."
"22581700","22582220"," Ooh. "
"22582940","22587500"," Quinn's asking if he, if he, if he, does everybody think that Cleveland Cliffs will make it to the"
"22587500","22588400"," playoffs this year?"
"22593360","22595680"," Do-boy capital still diamond-handed."
"22596100","22599720"," I know these bears, these bears are, I agree with them."
"22600260","22602400"," They are convinced we're selling off into this bow. "
"22602820","22604640"," I don't, I don't technically disagree with them."
"22604640","22609900"," You know what I don't like about technically what I don't like about the spy chart right now?"
"22611100","22612820"," Is the channel that we're in."
"22613420","22620460"," I don't like, I really want to see us sell down to like 468.84 into the bow. "
"22621360","22626140"," And then I'd buy that call, I'd buy calls if we sold down to that number."
"22627020","22636680"," If we sell down to four, here, if we sell down to 468.78. Or lower, into the bell, I"
"22636680","22637180"," will buy calls."
"22638520","22643620"," And I want some, one of you bears out there to scream at me not to buy the calls at"
"22643620","22645960"," the bell and tell me that we're going to doom and gloom. "
"22648400","22650680"," Because if you don't scream at me, I won't buy the calls."
"22656920","22658420"," Oh yeah, what's up in Vasco?"
"22658500","22659160"," Good to see you brother."
"22663020","22664500"," Spy is a heavy pennant. "
"22665180","22666820"," Ooh, I see that pennant too."
"22667660","22668980"," I see that heavy pennant."
"22670840","22675560"," We're going to sell down to 468.78. Or lower, into the bell. "
"22682210","22684390"," Yeah, this is the typical setup, right?"
"22684910","22685910"," We all know this setup."
"22686150","22687730"," We sell off into the bell in these days."
"22688430","22691630"," I mean, this is like, this is, if you took a snapshot of today. "
"22692150","22694130"," Shit, how many times have we seen these setups?"
"22695450","22700130"," You know, you ping off at the bell or later in the morning and then you drop down huge."
"22701990","22708050"," Right, you do the, you do the cash back or that cash back, you do the snap back trade."
"22709090","22712410"," Then we just kind of murder everything into the bell on an OPEC stay. "
"22713270","22718450"," And then you see this like huge capitulation right down into four o'clock."
"22720290","22721470"," Everyone's freaking out."
"22721850","22723730"," Everyone's afraid, panicking. "
"22724330","22728480"," I don't know if that happens today, but I've seen it a lot."
"22731680","22733460"," So let's see what happens now."
"22734720","22738340"," Or you're going to get the, or the market makers don't want to play with us anymore. "
"22740000","22742720"," They don't want to play with the bears and they don't want to play with the bulls anymore."
"22745600","22746740"," Too much volatility."
"22753340","22755160"," Give me a hit, brah. "
"22757560","22760640"," Yeah, you're a bloomers correct."
"22761560","22767640"," If you wanted to be patient here, you wait for 450 and grab those calls all day long."
"22769540","22770760"," All day long. "
"22774230","22776310"," Oh, you got Johnny Boy stepping in."
"22777070","22778310"," Don't buy calls."
"22784980","22786180"," Let's see what happens. "
"22786180","22788580"," It looks like they're parking it, doesn't it?"
"22793740","22795040"," Yeah, Willie smoked meat."
"22795380","22796140"," He's got it right."
"22796460","22797260"," Feels like summer. "
"22797820","22799360"," Dude, I don't know what we're going to do this summer."
"22800120","22803360"," I'm going to have a live feed of me snoring in the corner of the office."
"22804020","22805560"," I'm going to have to put up like a hammock or something. "
"22806620","22809300"," You just hear me snoring half the day away."
"22809860","22813240"," Some summers on Twitter, like people just fade out."
"22813660","22816560"," So I'll go over and say something to him and they'll be like, oh, I'm sorry, man. "
"22816660","22817280"," I just woke up."
"22817960","22818320"," I was sleeping."
"22823010","22824110"," Yeah, I don't mind that. "
"22824390","22825870"," I don't mind the sideways trade."
"22828910","22830950"," Parking it until bulk capitulation."
"22830950","22831590"," I agree with that. "
"22833270","22836310"," You just need a little bit more time for these bulls to get out of their trade."
"22838550","22845350"," If we traded sideways for a year, the bulls and the bears would get fat as fuck."
"22847010","22848050"," We get fat. "
"22848530","22851850"," We would make so much money if we traded sideways for a year."
"22852430","22854750"," Because you know what your tops and bottoms are."
"22855630","22856370"," We'll get fat. "
"22856610","22857130"," I'll retire."
"22857930","22860250"," If we traded sideways for one year, I would retire."
"22861210","22862870"," I would never, ever have to trade ever again. "
"22863970","22865490"," That would be the end of life for me, I think."
"22867310","22872290"," Like the way we've been trading since September and November has been outstanding for a trader."
"22872930","22874210"," It's been some of the best trading in years. "
"22876010","22877950"," Like, how do you trade meltups?"
"22878750","22880310"," How do you trade meltups as a bull?"
"22880310","22884530"," As a real trader, you can't trade them because you don't know when they're going to fall."
"22885590","22888110"," How do you time a meltup for the fall as a bear?"
"22888530","22889190"," You can't."
"22890550","22896070"," Like, I know when we melt up and shit that I know lots of traders that just stop trading. "
"22897090","22898110"," You just don't even bother."
"22899850","22904930"," Like, you'll trade the setup and then as soon as you break out of that setup and start doing, you"
"22904930","22905630"," know, weird shit."
"22905970","22907510"," You just don't even get involved anymore. "
"22908850","22910710"," Like the past three months or so?"
"22911250","22912850"," All these expanding megaphones?"
"22913610","22915810"," Like, this shit's been banking."
"22917570","22918070"," Banking."
"22928200","22931060"," Johnny Boy is saying last eight weeks, best two months ever. "
"22931380","22931560"," Yeah, dude."
"22932020","22937220"," If you're a trader, this is the easiest environment that you could ever have or ever ask for."
"22937860","22939660"," It doesn't get any easier than this. "
"22943290","22944090"," I mean, think about it."
"22944090","22948130"," If you're a bull and we rip from like, let's say we rip from like 470 to 480."
"22949330","22953050"," We're at the top of a megaphone and then we just rip another hundred points. "
"22953690","22955430"," Like, how do you know when to get out of those calls?"
"22955770","22956270"," You don't."
"22956690","22958230"," You don't know when to get out of those calls."
"22958710","22959750"," You can't tell me that you know. "
"22960550","22964110"," You can't tell me that you would have taken the trade outside of that megaphone for another hundred"
"22964110","22964370"," points."
"22964890","22966750"," I mean, people do it, but it's dangerous."
"22967930","22970510"," And as a bear, how do you even start to short that shit?"
"22970710","22971230"," You can't. "
"22971230","22976050"," And it just like, it just ends up squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and squeezing."
"22976890","22978990"," But like right now, everybody's getting fat."
"22979270","22981390"," You can't say that everybody's not getting fat off these trades. "
"22983690","22986010"," Trading both sides, knowing when it's going to bounce."
"22987210","22988430"," And the shit's like clockwork generally."
"22992340","22994060"," You're going to put CVLT in there?"
"22995500","22997100"," Yeah, Willie smoked me to greed. "
"22997560","22998520"," A bigger megaphone, please."
"23005570","23006630"," Like, how do you, how do you not?"
"23008050","23010750"," How do you guys not like this trading zone?"
"23011150","23012010"," It's almost perfect."
"23013930","23015390"," As a trader, it's banging. "
"23017030","23021710"," As an investor, you really want the market to sell off so you can buy some cheap stock."
"23022650","23024390"," And you can run it up for a year or two."
"23024910","23027970"," But as a trader, this stuff's been nothing less than epic. "
"23029510","23029810"," What is this?"
"23030510","23031230"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"23032010","23033670"," Spy calls are almost down to seven cents."
"23035570","23037590"," Just whittle them down, market makers. "
"23041760","23043980"," Market makers just grinding these calls."
"23055690","23059090"," Have some spy calls being bought, apple calls being bought."
"23060630","23063010"," K-web, I don't trust K-web ever. "
"23067800","23069740"," Small bids, though, 28 grand."
"23072240","23077980"," January 14th, 177.5C. On the spy calls, there are 471s."
"23079320","23080660"," We're like $300,000. "
"23082300","23083740"," Expiring on January 14th."
"23086160","23090100"," I don't like buying spy calls right now until the bell."
"23090820","23094200"," Real shenanigans go on between now and the bell on weeklies. "
"23095160","23096060"," Two week out calls."
"23097160","23099680"," Be careful of buying any weeklies right now until the bell."
"23100760","23102820"," There's a lot of funny stuff that goes on. "
"23103320","23107600"," A lot of grinding happening right now on the options side of the trade."
"23110040","23112080"," Market makers are getting their blood right now."
"23124760","23126200"," You know, it might be a nice trade. "
"23126420","23128280"," Tomorrow is on the opening bell of Spy."
"23128980","23132060"," Just buying those condors or butterflies."
"23137060","23138060"," I'm just looking at that today. "
"23146100","23147480"," Unless we gap up tomorrow."
"23151400","23152920"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"23154320","23156160"," Yeah, I can't mess with China stocks anymore. "
"23156280","23156500"," I'm done."
"23163960","23166060"," Are you really going bull rest of the week?"
"23166440","23167300"," No, I don't think so."
"23167760","23168680"," Do you know what I think we do?"
"23169520","23170700"," I think we trade sideways. "
"23173320","23174480"," I think we're range bound."
"23187180","23188980"," You guys want to know what I think happens tomorrow?"
"23194170","23195370"," What do you guys want to know about?"
"23195630","23197090"," What do you want to know about tomorrow, Quinn?"
"23197210","23199050"," Do you want to know about?"
"23205910","23208290"," Which events do you want to know about Quinn tomorrow?"
"23220990","23223290"," Yeah, I don't think if I had to guess."
"23225250","23227730"," By playing to flip some zero dates near the bell. "
"23228390","23229510"," Okay, so."
"23231330","23232370"," Here's my concern."
"23232430","23232790"," Okay. "
"23233610","23235410"," Open yourself a chart."
"23237590","23240690"," Open yourself a chart that is what is this?"
"23242170","23243070"," Open up a."
"23245330","23246790"," Open up a one month chart."
"23248010","23249410"," On the spy itself. "
"23249410","23250410"," Even if you trade in futures."
"23250670","23251590"," Just open up a one month."
"23251990","23254190"," Well, I guess the future is probably a better chart to look at. "
"23254810","23257130"," Because it gives you a better view of what's going on in the market."
"23257150","23258110"," I'll go up the futures chart."
"23259270","23260090"," Let's start there. "
"23260410","23261070"," Let's talk about this."
"23262210","23263490"," So I always start."
"23265850","23268030"," I always try to take that larger view, right?"
"23270690","23275350"," I like E.S. because it shows expanded training ranges when I'm planning. "
"23276890","23278270"," We'll talk through how I do this."
"23288900","23290360"," Well, let's just look where we are."
"23291380","23291620"," Okay. "
"23293040","23294220"," We hit a nice."
"23294640","23295660"," We know that we had it."
"23295720","23298500"," We struck of gorgeous bottom on the spy. "
"23299420","23299560"," Right?"
"23299760","23301460"," We struck four, five, eight, six."
"23302360","23306140"," Now I know that there are people out there saying we're going to have another little mini"
"23306140","23306460"," correction."
"23307880","23308440"," Okay. "
"23308640","23310020"," So if you're bearish here."
"23310840","23313760"," Bears will tell you that we'll test once."
"23314300","23315120"," We'll test twice. "
"23315840","23317440"," And then we'll test a third time."
"23318140","23320000"," So your third test would be."
"23320700","23323260"," I think Master Wu said 460. "
"23324640","23326460"," That he was expecting a 460 retest."
"23327580","23328140"," Plausible."
"23329000","23330360"," We did have that sell off today. "
"23331320","23333240"," That seemed to be a third bounce."
"23334060","23336400"," Maybe we may be in futures tonight."
"23336500","23338740"," We ripped down into 460. "
"23339260","23342940"," Some like death spiral into Thursday."
"23343500","23345820"," I guess that's possible."
"23346640","23347640"," We've done that before. "
"23350840","23352940"," So that that's one side of the trade."
"23354940","23355780"," We are."
"23357120","23359580"," Above currently the volatility trigger. "
"23360980","23362320"," On ES, right?"
"23363020","23364680"," We're above 4,700, right?"
"23368680","23369980"," We're at 4,750."
"23372560","23375040"," If we trade up from here into the bell, right?"
"23375480","23377180"," It's not good for the bear case."
"23378200","23385620"," So if you're a bear here, you want to see us trade below 4,700 into this bell. "
"23386640","23388760"," You want to see us slip underneath it."
"23390220","23392700"," Because that that lends us to more volatility."
"23393920","23396060"," That adds volatility to the market. "
"23398020","23399120"," Did we make?"
"23399640","23401940"," We made a new new high today, right?"
"23402640","23404320"," We have a higher high today from yesterday."
"23404740","23406880"," We have a higher low from yesterday, right?"
"23407520","23408220"," So that's all bullish."
"23410040","23414580"," So as a bull, you're looking for us to close higher. "
"23414580","23420100"," If it's a bear, you're definitely looking for us to close lower than 4,68,94."
"23420960","23427420"," You want to see that because all the normal traditional indicators say that we go up at this point"
"23427420","23427980"," tomorrow."
"23430400","23433220"," You've seen some call expansion later in the day. "
"23434220","23440040"," If you're looking at the flow, you're looking, we had really horrible flow, really horrible hedging"
"23440040","23441660"," in the beginning of the day."
"23442800","23449180"," We had 12 million inputs on the queues, 12 million inputs on spy."
"23451820","23454780"," But I've also seen FCX with stupid calls. "
"23455300","23457980"," Why trade the spy if we can trade FCX?"
"23459800","23462200"," UPST had stupid calls come in on it."
"23462300","23465240"," So I could trade that instead of the spy and not have to call a decision."
"23468760","23477920"," Spy had insane call buying after 11 a.m. And it's continued into 3.36 this afternoon. "
"23478180","23479600"," So maybe I'm splitting the day in half."
"23480900","23483940"," And then I've got the market makers that don't want to make this chip move."
"23484260","23486660"," Like the market makers, you got theta gang. "
"23487720","23490460"," We're like right in that middle trade area right here."
"23492360","23493600"," So what do I think we do?"
"23496340","23503800"," I'd really like to see us trade down to 4.68. And then I grab some calls."
"23507020","23508760"," So I don't know that I have a play at the moment. "
"23517000","23517440"," CVLT."
"23519940","23521300"," And then over the spy."
"23522560","23526380"," So let me know what you guys have for a plan in two tomorrow. "
"23527140","23528420"," And sometimes I don't take a trade."
"23529320","23531440"," So I might not take a trade into the close today."
"23532760","23536280"," We got more sellers than buyers on CVLT. "
"23536920","23537600"," Buy the dip."
"23538460","23538920"," $66."
"23545560","23548780"," So if I don't get the price that I want on the spy into the bell. "
"23550140","23552060"," Then I don't know."
"23552680","23553920"," I'll take a peek at the."
"23558510","23560430"," Let's look and see what we can see here. "
"23561150","23566430"," See if we see any by the dip forming for tomorrow on."
"23568370","23575290"," Looks like the by the dippers have moved up from 4.50. Looks like they're now moved up to 4 "
"23575290","23586200",".50 and 4.56. All"
"23586200","23588800"," that negative hero is coming from that hedging this morning."
"23589980","23593220"," Let me know what you guys are doing or contemplating doing into the bell. "
"23594460","23596660"," I will say this if we close above."
"23598020","23602540"," 4.70. It's not a positive thing for the bulls or for the bears."
"23603660","23610060"," If you're a bear you want to see us close below 4.70. It's important for bears. "
"23610980","23612340"," You want to see us slip underneath."
"23612940","23616780"," I'll look at the market profile right now too."
"23621160","23622160"," The volume profile. "
"23625240","23626840"," See what that looks like heading to the close."
"23632510","23634890"," I don't know if I'm ready to take a trade on the spy."
"23637190","23638170"," What are you guys thinking?"
"23638650","23640610"," You guys going along with on Tesla through this?"
"23645360","23646600"," Oh yeah, Desperado. "
"23646720","23648980"," We printed fat on those 4.70s, didn't we?"
"23649840","23651920"," And the 4.72s printed fat too."
"23660440","23661880"," Yeah, we got PMI tomorrow."
"23662380","23664060"," We've got what's her name is. "
"23664740","23667720"," Lane Lane Laney or is it Lane Bernard or Brainard?"
"23668260","23670640"," She I think gets her confirmation tomorrow."
"23671520","23672220"," Lael Bernard."
"23675400","23679360"," That's at 10 a.m. Maybe we sell down into 10 a.m. and then we rip. "
"23684910","23686310"," We got claims tomorrow."
"23686570","23687910"," We got continuing claims tomorrow."
"23689050","23691130"," We've got the PPI, the producer price index. "
"23691470","23691830"," That's important."
"23692550","23693390"," That's all volatile."
"23693890","23695370"," You know, claims initial claims and claims. "
"23695950","23696810"," PPI is volatile."
"23698690","23701630"," Lael Bernard should be should be soft handed for sure."
"23701930","23703030"," He'll soft hand her. "
"23703530","23706390"," And you got Mean Old Tom Bark and coming out at 12 o'clock noon."
"23707090","23715900"," And you got Mean Old Charles Evans coming out at 1 p.m. Lael Bernard is known as a soldier"
"23715900","23717900"," or whatever she's told to do."
"23719320","23721900"," It doesn't matter if it's a Republican or Democrat in power. "
"23722760","23725920"," She's I recall that she is neutral."
"23726920","23729400"," She works at the whim of the whoever's in power."
"23741550","23746890"," Maybe bears are thinking that Lael Bernard or come in and act like she's a boss or something. "
"23746970","23747850"," She can't do that."
"23747910","23750370"," I don't think that's appropriate at the moment."
"23753430","23755170"," You see this moving up right now?"
"23755650","23758650"," This is going to be a big, big, this is going to be an important thing for. "
"23758650","23761450"," I want you to get our least in terms of the."
"23763510","23764930"," At least in terms."
"23768130","23768310"," Of. "
"23770750","23772070"," Volatility in gamma."
"23782240","23783600"," Close that stuff up."
"23791600","23797390"," In terms of gamma and volatility. "
"23798890","23800490"," We're at a pretty important place."
"23809960","23812540"," If we slip under it's it's bearish."
"23814620","23816320"," And I do want you to know on ES. "
"23817420","23819920"," We are at the top of a significant iceberg."
"23822760","23825020"," I see why that trade is being taken on."
"23827360","23829100"," Value area low is time. "
"23829300","23830980"," We broke through value area low today."
"23831840","23834360"," On the 15 day 10 day 15 minute."
"23837100","23838500"," That's in the one hour hold on. "
"23839580","23840760"," At the time wrong here."
"23841440","23844600"," Look at the date and time price or time axis."
"23852570","23853930"," Give me a second here. "
"23859950","23863610"," Yeah, we're in some pretty good support on the on the ES right now."
"23865070","23867370"," You'd have to have some heavy selling in tomorrow."
"23869710","23873970"," They're probably good to 47 six or seven six zero. "
"23875050","23876050"," I think we're bullish."
"23878470","23880470"," I'm looking at the volume profile right now."
"23882030","23883710"," And we're looking pretty pretty bullish here. "
"23899520","23901640"," Or at least volume profiles saying we're bullish."
"23904770","23906950"," I'd looked out at the hourly I looked at in the 15 minute."
"23907590","23909130"," We're at the top of a giant iceberg. "
"23909790","23912850"," You need some really serious negative news to sell us down further."
"23920100","23925280"," And the 472 C's that are expiring today and the 12th."
"23925280","23930180"," Now worth 13 cents 14 cents 15 cents. "
"23937220","23938920"," All those shitty calls."
"23939580","23940900"," They're going up."
"23944900","23946000"," You guys see that?"
"23946780","23952000"," Remember the remember the shitty degenerate trade?"
"23953020","23956100"," 472 C expiring today. "
"23957100","23958320"," It's up to 15 cents."
"23958520","23959620"," Now it's down to 12 cents."
"23980810","23987710"," Yeah, what I call them at five or six cents. "
"23987970","23989890"," They went 300%."
"23993340","23995980"," I said buy and put a put an order in for five cents."
"23996560","23998800"," They went to 15 cents at one moment. "
"24003730","24006070"," That's a 200 or 300% trade."
"24011990","24013730"," That's a DJ and move for you."
"24013830","24015430"," That's an old school Wall Street bet trick. "
"24020280","24021100"," Harbor trash."
"24031870","24034630"," Yeah, I think you can easily trade to two."
"24035110","24038210"," You can easily trade before you get into any trouble right here. "
"24038250","24041230"," You can trade to four seventy five eight point eight one."
"24041770","24042370"," In all honesty."
"24049400","24052880"," And those calls will probably print even fatter here in a minute. "
"24053720","24055680"," Now they're down to seven or eight cents."
"24059000","24061300"," Probably get a nice fat quick rip in the close."
"24064920","24069720"," They were down to like three cents or two cents or something five cents. "
"24070520","24072420"," And they ripped up to 15 cents."
"24072800","24074000"," Now they're down to six cents."
"24076750","24080650"," If you see it hit like three cents now, now that you saw it go down to three cents. "
"24081350","24083410"," You're looking for them to hit three cents again."
"24084030","24086630"," And then you run them back up to like five or ten cents."
"24092750","24094030"," Don't buy them at like 10. "
"24095070","24097090"," You want to be selling them hopefully at 10."
"24097090","24100950"," Because the range goes down as we head into the bell."
"24101650","24106270"," So if you can buy them at like two cents selling them a four cents or five cents. "
"24107870","24114060"," You make hundred percent plays like two three times."
"24123460","24125380"," Come on four seventy two."
"24155160","24157260"," Don't trust them at six cents right now. "
"24160590","24162210"," You want to see them down at like three again."
"24191350","24192530"," This is very bullish."
"24192730","24199900"," I want the bears to know this at the moment. "
"24199960","24202540"," Unless we have a sell the news in the last five minutes."
"24203440","24207360"," That the market is in a slightly bullish context here."
"24208300","24211320"," I want to see us close above four seven one four. "
"24212100","24212780"," And here we go."
"24212780","24213540"," We're ripping now."
"24214780","24217780"," If you're a bull, you want to see us close above four seven one four. "
"24225880","24228820"," Four seventy two is an hour fifteen cents again."
"24268340","24273060"," Four seventy two's have been down to like six cents, three cents, five cents, eight cents."
"24273820","24275860"," They're just printing hundred percent prints down there. "
"24294280","24295600"," Yeah, this is pretty bullish."
"24297720","24298760"," Contextually overall."
"24299660","24301860"," This is a bullish development into the close. "
"24302600","24303820"," We could sell down tomorrow."
"24304260","24304520"," Wait a minute."
"24304620","24305300"," What do you guys see this?"
"24305300","24308480"," I mean, we've got jet blue calls. "
"24308820","24310760"," S P X U E."
"24311160","24314550"," 12.5 C for for February 25th."
"24315320","24316680"," We've got X calls."
"24316900","24323280"," You guys are talking about materials June 17th, 24 C golden ticket, two point one million dollars. "
"24323880","24325080"," Ready X."
"24326600","24328700"," June 17th, 24 C."
"24330300","24332540"," Two point one million dollars on X."
"24334700","24338680"," Spy calls January 14th, 40, 71 C."
"24340440","24347200"," United Airlines, 47 C on January 14th, American Airlines, 18.5 C."
"24348900","24354360"," Jet blue calls coming in again January 20th, 22 C."
"24355460","24359140"," I don't like seeing this these S P X U calls."
"24362850","24367410"," There's some QQQ puts coming in at the moment right now."
"24375280","24382180"," And those four 72 C's expiring today are now up to 17 cents. "
"24384720","24386680"," Do not hold those into the bell."
"24387180","24389440"," Do not hold them past three fifty nine."
"24389960","24391140"," Take profit. "
"24397190","24399230"," They're up to 18 cents now."
"24413020","24416380"," Do not hold calls expiring today after the bell."
"24417120","24417660"," Ever. "
"24434140","24435280"," Okay, dad."
"24436520","24437320"," Mateus."
"24437760","24438980"," Damn you, Mateus. "
"24439560","24440120"," Damn you."
"24441620","24446900"," Okay, so I move into Spy tomorrow is a tough one."
"24447760","24452540"," I can't call this one for you guys. "
"24452940","24455820"," I'm probably going to wait on the sidelines on this."
"24455820","24463640"," If you really wanted to degenerate, or not degenerate, but a safe call, I'd say grab four 75 C's"
"24463640","24464560"," expiring on Friday."
"24466380","24469460"," And I would have some put protection of some kind. "
"24470400","24477560"," So kind of spread by the spread for expiring on the 26th, right?"
"24477820","24478320"," For FOMC."
"24480240","24481500"," Grab another spread."
"24482960","24484480"," Just just this protection. "
"24486080","24492260"," And then you buy some calls expiring on Friday for four 75."
"24493380","24496200"," Only problem is if we trade sideways, get in there."
"24496280","24496860"," It's going to suck. "
"24497680","24504080"," If it takes us if it takes us from today into Friday to print for 75, it's going to really"
"24504080","24504960"," fucking suck."
"24511430","24516330"," Okay, so DJN101 is saying probably a red date tomorrow, to be honest."
"24522120","24523200"," I doubt that. "
"24523980","24526820"," I would bet that we trade sideways."
"24529120","24530140"," The best trade."
"24530540","24535860"," The best trade is probably going to be a fly or a condor at the bell tomorrow. "
"24536700","24537760"," That's my best guess."
"24540100","24544180"," Right out of the right side of the bell tomorrow within the first five minutes."
"24544680","24545860"," Slam on a butterfly. "
"24547340","24551880"," And we're going to we're going to trade right near that right between right between that implied"
"24551880","24553380"," range into into Friday."
"24554320","24559280"," Whatever we wind up tomorrow morning, we'll trade within that range into Friday."
"24560820","24561740"," That's my bet. "
"24564180","24568100"," More FCX or FCK or excuse me, FCX calls coming in."
"24568460","24569400"," Easy trade, right?"
"24573460","24574680"," HPQ coming in."
"24575420","24576560"," Only 12 grand though. "
"24577560","24579500"," 40c January 14th."
"24590750","24591670"," Yeah, I'm probably going to."
"24597230","24602070"," Yeah, we should do a class on the options class on you guys all sign up for options. "
"24602390","24604410"," AI will do some basic spreads."
"24609240","24612060"," I'm probably going to not buy anything here."
"24612300","24614060"," If I see something after the bell, maybe. "
"24615160","24618500"," But I'm probably going to wait until the open tomorrow."
"24618860","24621740"," Like some days I can see where it's going and some days I can't."
"24622160","24623660"," I'm not confident right now. "
"24627440","24628360"," The VYN."
"24629240","24630660"," What are you guys thinking about tomorrow?"
"24631620","24632640"," I think we trade sideways."
"24633760","24634440"," I'll be honest. "
"24634620","24635320"," No matter where we open."
"24635620","24637900"," I think if we open down tomorrow, we trade sideways from there."
"24637900","24640520"," I think if we open up tomorrow, we trade sideways from there. "
"24650500","24657040"," The only thing that I can tell you about tomorrow for sure is that all the traditional indicators"
"24659440","24665560"," say that if we close above 41, 14, 4, 1, 0, and 4, 700."
"24668500","24670400"," That we are above the vol trigger."
"24672440","24674740"," If we close above 47, 1, 4."
"24676060","24678060"," And we close above 47, 0."
"24678440","24680560"," No matter what anyone says, we're above vol trigger. "
"24681480","24687680"," And I don't have to say to that, you know, on ES at least."
"24688320","24692300"," And then, you know, we had a higher low today."
"24692400","24693520"," We had a higher high today. "
"24694540","24696620"," We didn't close with a lower low."
"24697000","24700260"," Like us not closing below the low of the morning is bullish."
"24701360","24704180"," So you got to look back here at 11 o'clock, right?"
"24704180","24706300"," We tagged 468, 90. "
"24707500","24710660"," You want to see us close lower than that number."
"24710880","24713640"," All the different things that traders talk about."
"24714060","24717420"," We didn't hit any of those bearish signs, right?"
"24717560","24719180"," These are like old wives tales, right?"
"24720120","24723780"," At the end of the day, we didn't close lower than the low of the morning. "
"24724760","24725940"," Yeah, everything is chopped."
"24728320","24729200"," There's no juice."
"24729560","24730240"," I agree for us. "
"24730240","24734480"," We could end up hitting 475 on Friday and you'll all be worthless."
"24735140","24738040"," Like you want your calls won't print, your puts won't print."
"24738580","24740020"," We can day trade at live tomorrow. "
"24740220","24742820"," We'll just do like small trades throughout the day."
"24743840","24746300"," But like everything here is pointing towards."
"24746780","24748280"," We had a big hedges coming on. "
"24749360","24753460"," We got we got a whole bunch of shit that didn't match a bearish."
"24753880","24756080"," It doesn't match a bearish story."
"24757280","24760040"," You're like we've got way get higher high. "
"24760700","24763260"," We've got a close."
"24763520","24765300"," We have no lower low close in the day."
"24765620","24768060"," We have no lower low close in the previous day. "
"24769720","24774480"," I can't say to you that everything is adding up to anything positive."
"24774480","24776320"," It's nothing that I'm going to tell you."
"24776600","24778940"," Yeah, I'm sure in this trade is not. "
"24782480","24785280"," I would say stick to individual tickers right now."
"24788780","24790360"," Yeah, there's no juice for us."
"24790520","24790800"," I agree. "
"24795410","24796110"," I agree."
"24796690","24798470"," And if anything, this is a bullish close."
"24799130","24800350"," So that's the truth. "
"24802610","24805370"," So you wait for the open tomorrow to set a condor."
"24806490","24809710"," You guys want to be set in condors and butterflies typically."
"24810590","24812310"," Like on a Thursday or a Friday. "
"24813610","24814790"," Both are good days."
"24818370","24820450"," Yeah, of course, sideways makes the most sense."
"24820630","24822350"," There's no real sense of urgency or direction. "
"24823270","24826610"," You might get a little pump tomorrow by a brainer being."
"24827070","24828650"," They're not going to rip rain or tomorrow."
"24829570","24831090"," They're going to welcome or with open arms. "
"24835140","24836280"," Yeah, you all have a great night."
"24836480","24837240"," Have a great night, Paul."
