"79600","80820"," Oh, thank you, monkey."
"82080","83720"," Good morning to you. "
"85060","85460"," Beargang."
"86740","89120"," Euroboomer, did you actually end up getting paid last night?"
"89280","90620"," I watched futures briefly."
"91600","94680"," And I saw it just going up and down, up and down, up and down. "
"95560","99000"," Did you end up holding all night long into the six o'clock hour this morning?"
"99520","100100"," Good morning, Jill."

"114300","119040"," So we're going to take a quick look as we open up this morning so we can see where the"
"119040","121260"," real levels are at this point, right?"
"121700","122400"," Good morning, Frederick."
"122600","123180"," Good morning, Dougie. "
"123220","124580"," Good morning, Al, Angie."
"125240","126160"," So wait one second here."
"126200","127280"," I got to tell you guys that I did. "
"129139","130600"," So I'm going to talk to you guys about."
"132940","134240"," It's a wild open right here."
"134960","136120"," I mean, look at this right here. "
"136120","140240"," I have to check something I might have to take."
"140680","146650"," A son of a bitch."
"147250","150810"," Oh, just sell them. "
"151590","152250"," Hold on."
"152350","156710"," I'm trying to sell out of some puts that I bought at the last minute yesterday."
"164480","165000"," Sweet. "
"166960","168480"," I just sold some puts."
"171460","173040"," Hold on one second here."
"173560","175620"," I want to be able to watch to see what's going on. "
"176480","177080"," All right."
"177280","183240"," So right off the bell, I do want you to see that there was a bounce this morning at 40."
"185040","186320"," See where it's at here. "
"189280","191800"," So, of course, the stock market looks wild right now."
"191960","193860"," Even book map looks wild right now."
"196340","197820"," So we'll have a little chat. "
"198100","202160"," So yesterday, I don't know how many people stayed on with us here."
"202700","203960"," Until 4 15."
"204420","206140"," I think Euroburn Bloomer was here. "
"206260","208020"," Good morning, Omar, P.E. John."
"208580","211100"," Good morning, Scott, Quantum Leap, Starlight, Fisted."
"211700","214100"," Good morning, Ironsense, or Ions. "

"218460","220060"," Good morning, Azul, Pinky. "
"220500","221620"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"221740","221920"," John."
"222040","222360"," Good morning. "
"222780","222920"," Josh."
"223200","223520"," Good morning."
"224040","224440"," Morning, son. "
"225160","225920"," Good morning, Dougie."
"226020","226560"," Good morning now."
"226780","227560"," Good morning, Angie. "
"227640","228340"," Good morning, Light Productions."
"229200","230700"," Morning, everybody that's out there."
"230900","234920"," So I just sold some puts that I bought at 4 14 yesterday. "
"236640","238600"," I don't want to talk about that real quick."
"239200","240680"," Good morning, everybody that's out there."
"241280","242300"," Yeah, I've still got calls. "
"242460","243180"," I haven't closed them."
"243640","245640"," And they expire today, so we'll see what happens."
"247880","251260"," There is some sellers above here at 4 6 4 4 3."
"251880","254260"," So we'll see if we get a rejection above here. "
"257390","259329"," Let me let us know in the chat real quick."
"259450","260170"," Good morning, hot, hot, hot."
"260390","261089"," Morning, Paul. "
"261250","262350"," Good morning, YT, Arm Boy."
"262890","263890"," Guacad, good morning."
"264490","265390"," John, good morning. "
"267850","271650"," Okay, so we'll start watching this right off the bat here, okay?"
"271910","276950"," We do have more sellers than buyers currently at the moment, right off the bell."
"277790","280870"," The hero indicator off the bell is positive."
"282350","287530"," Looks like we've got a long litany of sellers above here. "
"288570","290270"," We have a lot to talk about this morning."
"292750","299190"," Some of you stayed with me yesterday after the bell, and what I wanted to talk about was what I'm"
"299190","300910"," going to show you this information later."
"301650","308910"," But after the belly yesterday, this is interesting too, because the the SG morning report this"
"308910","312710"," morning is not absolutely but it's very inaccurate. "
"314070","322470"," And I'm not sure quite why they didn't catch this yesterday, but after the bell at about 4 10 in"
"322470","327090"," the afternoon, we had major hedging coming through on the spy."
"328530","335770"," Someone had placed the hedge of 10 million dollars, I think it was 10 plus million dollars on the"
"335770","337230"," spy early expiry."
"337850","339090"," I want to say it was February 18th. "
"339950","342310"," Well, I'll take a look at it and see what it is."
"344940","348460"," But there was hedging done yesterday at 4 10 p "
"348460","356400",".m., major"
"356400","359000"," hedging."
"359820","363480"," Last night, so I went to bed late last night, scratching my head gone. "
"363760","364420"," This is interesting."
"365300","369180"," I would have figured that dealers would have sold futures and they didn't."
"369980","371680"," But they did sell them this morning. "
"372380","376480"," I did grab a small portion of position of puts."
"377640","380260"," They just sold at this moment, but I'm still my cause."
"380320","383920"," The calls are wrecked, but that's fine because we'll talk more. "
"384060","385640"," I want to talk about that this morning as well."
"387620","391960"," Because yesterday I saw someone talking about how they'll be wrecked if we don't go up this morning"
"391960","397660"," about how much percentage of your trading account you should be trading stuff like that."
"397900","398820"," We talk about that at times. "
"398960","402920"," We're going to talk about it again this morning because I want to grab more."
"403080","404320"," I'm going to grab more longs again."
"406280","410980"," And after we open up here, once the market settles down, I'm going to turn book map off for just"
"410980","411380"," a minute. "
"412560","415740"," Because I want to go through the stock market."
"415980","417380"," So I read a story this morning."
"417900","418500"," It was a couple of things. "
"418860","424980"," First off, Citigroup, tell me Citigroup didn't sell off exactly how we talked about it selling off"
"424980","425300"," yesterday."
"426500","430020"," Kick ass earnings still sold off in the middle of the night."
"431380","432600"," That was sell the news, right?"
"433400","436220"," So did it matter if they had good earnings or not?"
"436800","437080"," Hell no. "
"437700","438720"," Hell no, it didn't matter."
"439320","444720"," And the market was up this morning at 6 a.m. I just took a look and it didn't sell"
"444720","446560"," off until 6.30 or something like that."
"449260","456880"," So I'm wondering if that hedging was a part of the sell off at 6 a.m. Now the news"
"456880","459720"," stories that I read this morning are all over the place. "
"459720","462480"," I've got I've got Spock gamma telling me one thing."
"463500","470840"," I've got I've got a news story saying a completely other thing that doesn't match up either to"
"470840","471700"," what's going on."
"472780","474040"," I did yesterday. "
"474460","476740"," I didn't get a chance to check out Mr. Yen's video."
"476820","477940"," I'm going to do that."
"478080","481120"," Someone recommended I watch Mr. Yen's market rant video. "
"481500","483240"," I haven't had a chance to watch it, but I will."
"483620","484360"," I promise I will."
"484680","487860"," I haven't been watching them lately, but I will watch that video. "
"489520","492240"," But I do want to talk about where we actually are in the market."
"492240","496840"," I want to talk about what's going on in the background because I did do some research this morning."
"497140","503540"," I was stuck last night working on the discord, but this morning I did some quick looking at stocks. "
"504300","504920"," It's really odd."
"505400","507600"," You know, Tesla."
"508180","513440"," I read this story this morning from what I read this story from. "
"514440","515799"," It's a shitty news source."
"515799","517179"," It's investors business daily."
"517679","522760"," But they said this morning, you know, Dow Jones futures signals market sell off to continue. "
"523540","524040"," Right?"
"525540","529380"," And they let me they just trash like they trash Tesla this morning."
"529900","535820"," And I want to show you guys some of the stocks that I look at to see where we really"
"535820","536160"," are."
"536440","538240"," You know, I'm looking at their they ripped Tesla. "
"538380","540280"," They just like Tesla's horrible."
"540620","541600"," It's the worst stock ever."
"542980","544480"," It's a part of the market crash. "
"544480","546260"," You know, I'm looking at Tesla."
"546560","549020"," Well, right now Tesla's already up to 1023, right?"
"550240","555020"," When we when you see hedges like that come in yesterday at 4 10 p.m. You typically see a"
"555020","557140"," dip in the stock market almost immediately."
"558520","568080"," So that was a planned hedge move by some hedge funder bank yesterday at 4 10 p.m. And the"
"568080","571100"," impact wasn't felt in the market until this morning. "
"571440","573540"," That's actually what took place last night."
"573540","580660"," And so you saw the dealer selling this morning at 6 a.m. This had in my view, this had"
"580660","582360"," nothing to do with where we are right now."
"582600","585860"," You see Tesla just ripping off right now as high as they can go. "
"586220","588940"," You know, it's crazy because I'm watching this this morning."
"589420","590560"," I'm reading this this morning."
"591560","595980"," And I'm left from my ass off because I'm like, man, if I had $10 million to buy a shit"
"595980","601720"," ton of puts at 4 10 p.m. Of course, the market's going to dip on the open tomorrow morning"
"601720","603000"," or in the overnight at some point. "
"603000","604600"," Which it didn't in the overnight."
"605120","610000"," So that's what the dealers did this morning at 6 a.m. So I'm going to try to explain this"
"610000","613320"," and show you the map this morning and how what happened."
"614780","619760"," Now, spot gamma did say if they saw if we saw continued hedging today, you would see further"
"619760","620200"," downside. "
"622400","625760"," To me, this was just as we've done this many, many times in the past."
"626080","627760"," We do it in the on the upper moves."
"627980","631000"," We do it in the lower moves where we wind up trading down. "
"632240","634780"," To get that last little bit of profit."
"634780","636200"," That's really what it is."
"636540","637700"," It's profit making. "
"638600","640180"," Tesla's now up to 10 40."
"640640","643220"," And this is a this is why I'm watching Tesla at this moment."
"644460","647300"," Because the news stories on the other hand this morning. "
"648060","650060"," We're signaling market doom and gloom."
"652260","655900"," And I'm watching the market from a couple of perspectives."
"656840","660980"," You know, I'm seeing Tesla just yesterday at 11 15. "
"660980","662020"," Right?"
"662120","663520"," It's at 11 15."
"664660","666380"," Is its price yesterday, right?"
"666920","672100"," It's it hasn't even hit a low from just four days ago."
"672660","674920"," So it's low four days ago was nine 78. "
"675600","677220"," So how is this a market crash?"
"677280","677780"," Right?"
"677960","678460"," That's number one."
"678780","684280"," And then the other low that it had was back on December 21st at 886."
"685860","693040"," So then I'm looking at like a Tesla to say, are we in a market crash situation at this point?"
"693140","694500"," Like I'm using bellwethers. "
"694800","698460"," Like is this stock actually signaling a market crash?"
"699760","700980"," And I'm not seeing it."
"700980","702840"," I'm not seeing it right off the bell this morning either."
"703380","705440"," So there's some concern from my end, right?"
"705720","713340"," And the reason I'm saying this is because on the other hand, I'm looking at stocks like SQ, right?"
"713840","715380"," I'm looking at I got a whole bunch of them. "
"718340","719940"," I'm looking at stocks like SQ."
"720980","722700"," Here's a great one to look at."
"722800","725240"," If you compare Peton, right?"
"725900","735160"," Peton is just starting to sell down to its March May lows of 2020, which is what I want to"
"735160","735860"," see out of SQ. "
"736300","737740"," I haven't seen that yet out of SQ."
"738280","742020"," I didn't even see it last night in the sell down this morning in SQ."
"742020","747040"," I wanted to see SQ just like capitulate down to the depths of hell. "
"747480","752740"," I'm looking for DKNG to sell off to the pet pits of hell."
"753180","759360"," I'm looking and meanwhile, we're actually selling off the cyber security cloud shit that they tried"
"759360","764000"," to pawn off on people back in November, December saying that was the trade of 2022."
"764740","768640"," So I'm looking for like a firm to sell down to nothing. "
"769060","771120"," Data data dog to sell down to nothing."
"771500","773340"," Elsa to sell down to nothing."
"773920","775460"," Shopify to sell down to nothing. "
"776340","780120"," Even Roblox, I don't want them to sell down to nothing, but I'm expecting more."
"780800","783740"," I'm expecting C, like SC, that trade."
"783920","787580"," I traded SC for an entire year and all it did was print. "
"788360","793160"," But I want SC to come back to like, I've got some tags on SC."
"794860","796680"," Like you want to know where I want to see SC?"
"798620","801020"," I want to see SC at like $55."
"802940","806820"," So if we're in that market crash situation right now, where is it?"
"808760","810600"," If we're if we're in this situation. "
"812700","816160"," Well, I got to look at my calls and see how bad the damage is."
"817960","818440"," Oof."
"818440","818920"," Ooh. "
"819480","823100"," I still have some hope left in my in my 470 C's."
"823420","824100"," Believe it or not."
"826380","828340"," So that's really what I'm looking for. "
"828800","829540"," I want to see."
"829960","837440"," I don't want to see a manufactured sell off this morning at 6 a.m. down to down to 460."
"837740","839100"," I want to see like 455. "
"840020","840680"," I want to see 450."
"841660","845460"," I really want to see like damaged under the market."
"845800","849100"," I'm looking for that between now and March at some point. "
"849500","851440"," I don't want it to take until May or June."
"851980","856520"," And so I'm looking for specific stocks to really sell off hard."
"856880","859080"," I want to see like Apple start selling down. "
"860380","863500"," I want to see that rates really do matter."
"864100","867440"," I really want to see that bond buying is going to end."
"868240","869460"," But I'm not seeing that in Apple. "
"869460","870740"," I'm not seeing it in Tesla."
"871360","875700"," I'm not seeing it where I'm not seeing the ultimate sell down in SQ."
"876240","878580"," I'm not seeing the ultimate sell down in SE. "
"879140","882860"," And so I'm looking for these 2020 trades to be done with."
"883280","884460"," And they're not done with yet."
"885160","887480"," They're not done taking profit yet. "
"888520","890300"," These tickers have not sold off."
"890700","893500"," The ones that have been propping up the stock market have not sold off."
"893920","897940"," This article this morning saying NQ is in the middle of a 10% correction. "
"897940","900660"," I'm like, where is the 10% correction in Apple?"
"901660","903000"," I'm not seeing that either."
"904680","907360"," So now I'm still in my calls."
"907560","909780"," I exited my puts right off the bell this morning. "
"910340","912060"," I bought some puts at the last moment."
"914300","916600"," Yesterday, because yesterday at four o'clock in the afternoon."
"917560","919980"," We yesterday at four P or at four 10. "
"920700","922740"," We watched a few of us were still left on the channel."
"922900","928100"," We watched some put hedge walls coming in like last last five minutes or so of the market."
"929080","932340"," So I did save myself some money this morning by putting that slight. "
"932720","936160"," It wasn't even as much as what I think."
"936160","940840"," I might make four 70 calls for four or for 28 cents was my average."
"941420","942780"," And they're down to 10 cents. "
"942940","943840"," Now they're down to nine cents."
"944920","945580"," So I'm going to hold those."
"946000","947520"," Hopefully we get a snap back this morning. "
"948460","954000"," If you are still uber bearish and you disagree with what I'm talking about happening this morning"
"954000","955420"," or over in the overnight."
"955920","957540"," If you want to believe the news articles."
"959480","964120"," Then you you know you take the short again at four sixty four fifty one. "
"965600","968860"," And I'll show you where you're looking for targets if you're bearish."
"969940","976240"," So to me this looks more manufactured than than any kind of anything that's being said in the news"
"976240","976800"," of this morning."
"977540","981220"," And it is funny to see SG not talking about what took place in the market. "
"981220","982680"," I'm going to close yesterday as well."
"985520","986220"," Excuse me."
"986640","987300"," So you get a."
"988660","991260"," Next target before forty nine thirty six. "
"991840","993000"," And then for forty."
"993600","995400"," This for forty was not here yesterday."
"996180","997680"," This came from that hedge. "
"998100","1000880"," I'm going to take a look this morning and see if they closed."
"1001680","1004040"," That position that they took out at four ten."
"1004640","1005920"," A lot yesterday at the bell. "
"1005920","1019020"," So anyways"
"1019020","1024119"," that's my take this morning on the market and why we went down as deep as we did at six"
"1024119","1028480"," a.m. Any of you that's just joining us and did weren't here right at the."
"1029220","1033780"," At the when we when I signed on this morning you might want to pause and go back and listen"
"1033780","1035280"," to my posit on this."
"1036180","1038280"," Because I haven't heard anybody talk about this this morning. "
"1038680","1041160"," I haven't heard anyone out there."
"1041540","1042800"," No news stories I haven't heard."
"1042800","1044460"," I haven't heard any. "
"1045260","1046700"," Anything in social media."
"1058250","1059370"," All right."
"1063390","1066670"," Hey I'm going to check these these puts and see if they're still on. "
"1078820","1079680"," Two eight."
"1112700","1114420"," Yeah and they're gone this morning."
"1114960","1118000"," So those puts that were placed at four twelve p.m. yesterday. "
"1118000","1119360"," They are gone."
"1119720","1122680"," They have cashed them out and they just left the market."
"1123740","1130740"," So there was I think ten or twelve million dollars in a huge put position on expiring on February"
"1130740","1133040"," 18th and they're gone this morning. "
"1134480","1139920"," They were they were here this morning or they were here yesterday for three minutes before the"
"1139920","1143780"," close of the bell and they've closed them out as of this morning."
"1143780","1150880"," So further reaffirms the same the same conversation that we were having when I first came on this"
"1150880","1151140"," morning."
"1151800","1152980"," Very smooth move. "
"1153600","1157220"," Whoever put those on out there if you do any guys know the bank to put those on last night"
"1157220","1157740"," congratulations."
"1162560","1168300"," Anyone that was here yesterday for that stuck around for the bell and remembers this happening"
"1168300","1169160"," yesterday as well."
"1169920","1173360"," And I'll post those puts this morning on Twitter for you. "
"1176850","1178650"," So my calls are up eleven cents."
"1179430","1180710"," Maybe I should double down on them."
"1191820","1193860"," Yeah get it out go to the beach. "
"1198320","1203260"," So I guess the question becomes at this point is do we reject off this four sixty four number."
"1203820","1208960"," We've got it here at four sixty four point forty four."
"1210020","1214920"," And if you're bearish if you if you're watching if you're reading the news this morning I guess"
"1214920","1218960"," you'd have to take out of the bearish stance for this was a raid kind of a thing. "
"1220260","1223580"," But I'm looking for more capitulation from specific stocks."
"1224060","1229420"," I'm looking for the stocks that are holding up the market to crash and I'm looking for capitulation"
"1229420","1234020"," in the stocks that were driven up in that trade for two straight years."
"1234020","1241940"," I also looked at yesterday the stocks that were the biggest gainers yesterday and so I was looking"
"1241940","1242860"," at the airline stocks. "
"1243080","1245540"," I'm interested this morning to see how well they're doing."
"1260180","1267820"," I want you to check out Hawaiian Airlines H.A. and look at them they sold off this morning but"
"1267820","1277130"," they've been on a track since December 2nd."
"1287310","1295160"," So take a look at Hawaiian Air and put them on a I think I have them on a three"
"1295160","1295680"," month chart. "
"1304110","1311530"," There's a nice pump going on smaller airlines not quite the United Airlines American Airlines and"
"1311530","1312630"," companies like that."
"1319300","1325400"," No you know it's really it's not a so Chase just said when you get capitulation it will be too"
"1325400","1332280"," late and in all honesty my market outlook right now is what we're looking for XLF."
"1332820","1338220"," Market outlook right now is where is the bottom to invest for 2022. "
"1339140","1348840"," And so what you're looking for is what I'm looking for is again we're back to"
"1348840","1355720"," you've got the indexes that are way up here that are being propped up by just a few stocks right."
"1355720","1361980"," And then you've got this this stealth correction that's going on down below and you're really"
"1361980","1368160"," looking for the last of these stocks to get whacked and then the four to six stocks to come down"
"1368500","1370720"," and have them all kind of match up again right."
"1371420","1373180"," And so that's what really what you're looking for. "
"1374380","1379080"," Other than that you can only risk or you can only hedge for a tail risk event that would sell"
"1379080","1386920"," us down to 400 350 200 150 something like that outside of that though you really are just looking"
"1386920","1393440"," for that last moment of capitulation and you're looking also for those four to six stocks to come"
"1393440","1399480"," down drop the indexes down so they both meet and then you know where bottom is for 2022."
"1400180","1403340"," And that that is not what took place yesterday nor this morning."
"1406090","1410910"," So my little pissed off I want for 50 as a matter of fact the puts that I bought were"
"1410910","1412570"," four fifty fives. "
"1413110","1416650"," And they were like eighteen cents or something like that into the clothes yesterday."
"1417370","1422750"," So I really wanted those to print and I really want us to have that capitulation moment at some"
"1422750","1423050"," point."
"1423430","1427850"," I don't know if it comes at the end of the tail end of earning season or if it waits"
"1427850","1429850"," until after ER is completely done. "
"1430190","1434130"," Maybe like the last week or so of major ER releases."
"1438450","1446790"," All right so let me check to see some of your comments this week as you guys."
"1451260","1453920"," It was neat to see how city groups sold off. "
"1456440","1459120"," Let me see if I can get a add on for you."
"1485100","1488640"," Looks like there's some support down here at thirty four thirty eight."
"1489060","1494900"," It has disappeared but still make a note of this on your charts if you're watching XLF. "
"1496820","1499660"," You've got a lot of ice above at forty four."
"1502880","1504200"," Hang tight here."
"1506100","1508260"," It was forty four eighty or something. "
"1511060","1513920"," Got a lot of ice above at forty two thirteen."
"1514800","1516160"," Make note of that one as well."
"1527520","1534860"," And then you'll also make note that of the sell offs that took place in the bank ERs that took"
"1534860","1536400"," place overnight and yesterday. "
"1536660","1542580"," You'll also see that that will impact the next round of bank reporting."
"1543260","1548720"," Though it doesn't always impact what actually happens in those ERs."
"1548900","1555140"," We have seen in the past you'll see like Nvidia have a great ER or Netflix will have a great"
"1555140","1557180"," ER early in earnings reporting season. "
"1557180","1560020"," You'll see the stock blast off."
"1560720","1565180"," And then the expectation is well the next tech ER is going to do the same."
"1565600","1568080"," So you'll see a ramp up at that point the following day. "
"1569020","1571360"," Yet those those ERs will sell off."
"1571780","1579360"," So I wouldn't I wouldn't correlate bank selling off to the next round of bank reporting doing the"
"1579360","1579660"," same."
"1580080","1582220"," They can often go the opposite way. "
"1582760","1585780"," Although there will be impact the following day."
"1585780","1586040"," Right."
"1586300","1593480"," So if you're if you see the initial impact the following day as you'll spook bulls in bank ERs that"
"1593480","1595160"," haven't taken place today. "
"1596280","1600720"," That might do it be a nice setup for a long into their ERs."
"1601020","1605300"," So you might want to be looking at some bank ERs if they sell off today."
"1605680","1608400"," If they sell off this week from from bull panic. "
"1609480","1611000"," That haven't reported yet."
"1611000","1616160"," They might be a nice long in actually into their ER due to bull panic."
"1616820","1618520"," So we'll look at XPI next. "
"1619180","1621240"," Let's see in much here on on XLF."
"1622260","1624360"," There's a little bit of support down below here."
"1624700","1629300"," Hero indicator is negative on on XLF. "
"1629320","1630740"," It's really not the best."
"1632900","1635660"," Spider to be looking at on on book map."
"1636160","1637220"," We'll check XPI next. "
"1637220","1641460"," And then I'll go through and check your favorite stickers or tickers that stickers."
"1647160","1652900"," And we're going to look at spy real quick and see if there is rejection or if we blast through"
"1652900","1653200"," here."
"1662920","1664320"," For 6450 right. "
"1667820","1669740"," Yeah returning to the scene of the crime."
"1670780","1671760"," This morning."
"1679060","1679900"," Yeah, hell no. "
"1680040","1681640"," I haven't sold those zero dates yet."
"1682320","1682920"," Hell no."
"1693510","1697150"," The week is like by the cucumber dip. "
"1701690","1704770"," Coin please need to know where to finally exit the door here."
"1704950","1705170"," Thanks."
"1705290","1705390"," Yep. "
"1705510","1707110"," I'll do coin for you."
"1707750","1710530"," I think I meant to do coin the other day and I didn't."
"1713260","1717300"," So I'll do coin next because I think I said I would do coin and I didn't. "
"1719100","1721260"," XPI is just bashing around here."
"1722460","1725000"," More buyers than sellers on XPI."
"1726020","1728760"," By the dips down here at 95 it looks like. "
"1734820","1737840"," Have some nice ice below at 95 bucks."
"1739000","1740780"," Look up coin next."
"1742360","1763480"," Going to"
"1763480","1768200"," be watching here to see if we break through the sellers on spy real quick. "
"1769760","1773400"," If you are uber bearish if you're believing the news stories that are out there."
"1773640","1777420"," This is your opportunity to begin to re short the market."
"1785080","1786860"," This would be the tag right in here. "
"1789120","1790200"," If you're uber bear."
"1808390","1809510"," Let's take a look at coin."
"1810030","1811470"," Was I laughing about coin yesterday. "
"1815060","1818380"," Was I saying don't I think I was I think it was just a general statement."
"1818660","1819580"," It was more of a."
"1820180","1821900"," Of a don't tell me your bags."
"1822040","1822780"," I don't want your bags. "
"1826480","1827000"," Okay."
"1828300","1831940"," So huge support down here in coin at 200 bucks."
"1834480","1835000"," 21089. "
"1836000","1839020"," 215 41 and 221 11."
"1839400","1841100"," I think Quinn's going to be pissed off at this."
"1842560","1845800"," Clear skies above on coin might be a nice trade this morning. "
"1845800","1846740"," You're already up to 231."
"1848540","1851300"," Got crazy buyers on coin this morning."
"1851800","1852620"," Crazy buyers. "
"1853300","1855560"," You guys might want to be watching coin this morning."
"1856100","1857360"," It's a v-wop right now."
"1857400","1862300"," It's sitting right on it at 227.56. Nice. "
"1862480","1863460"," Nice shout out in coin."
"1864500","1865060"," All right."
"1865360","1867200"," 250 is your price target. "
"1868160","1870180"," Possibly even 262 30."
"1873100","1877400"," I got to go back real quick and see if my calls are dead dead or if I'm going to."
"1877400","1880640"," I'm going to make my money back at least on my calls or not. "
"1884540","1888700"," Cody saying that Q comms off to a great start."
"1888900","1890280"," So we'll do Q Q comm."
"1892200","1893480"," I'm going to stay in my calls. "
"1893580","1894380"," I'm not giving them back."
"1895120","1900700"," I'm going to make the money off that last minute goes last minute puts and then at least save my"
"1900700","1902300"," my my cop my."
"1902300","1903940"," Call F D's. "
"1907530","1908970"," So put Q comm up."
"1909070","1910850"," Let it give it a few minutes to load up here."
"1913670","1923010"," We have by the dippers and the CVD buyers group is starting to overwhelm the sellers here at this"
"1923010","1923270"," moment. "
"1923270","1924530"," I think we break through here."
"1926170","1929050"," I think we're going to trade up those puts are gone this morning."
"1929650","1933370"," So I'm a little hesitant to start re shorting the market at this point. "
"1940210","1941290"," And I'll bring."
"1945580","1948420"," Sorry my voice after a week of broadcasting is brutal."
"1949540","1953680"," I'll have to be quiet the entire weekend for my throat to heal up. "
"1955160","1958540"," I will bring up Tesla next for you after Q comm."
"1963910","1966530"," And we'll look to see what I'll take a look at the options."
"1968150","1970530"," Yeah, it's the same same story with Q comm, right?"
"1970530","1972950"," Rip to one ninety one. "
"1973430","1977290"," Looks like we have more sellers at one ninety five today."
"1977910","1979470"," One ninety four thirty three."
"1979950","1983270"," Normally we see sellers at one ninety one ninety one. "
"1983570","1985990"," I'd still be careful you see this ice above here."
"1986850","1992670"," You might see these sellers sneak back in today on Q comm right around that one ninety one area."
"1993150","1997350"," Even though it's showing a higher number up here at one ninety five you could possibly take it"
"1997350","1997550"," there. "
"1998690","2001970"," The VWAP right now is currently sitting at one eighty five."
"2002730","2005130"," Looks like the sellers are higher than they were before."
"2005610","2008510"," It still looks like the same old story right with Q comm. "
"2010150","2012790"," By the dips down at one eighties or one seventies."
"2012870","2014990"," Sell the rips up here one eighty nine ninety."
"2015710","2017490"," See this little bash that just happened. "
"2018410","2022450"," First round of sellers stepped in one eighty eight eighty seven."
"2023890","2030890"," The VWAP's down at one eighty five two nine one eighty nine eighty two one ninety."
"2031130","2031530"," Same area. "
"2031550","2033370"," It looks like there's the same sellers above."
"2033970","2034690"," Trade it up."
"2035150","2035930"," Take profit. "
"2036530","2038130"," Look for another dip buy in Q comm."
"2039250","2042870"," And then next after that we're going to look at Tesla next."
"2043130","2044250"," We'll put Tesla up here. "
"2044970","2048710"," So I know the Tesla gang wants to want to wonder if there should be scared or not."
"2049389","2050670"," I'm not scared on Tesla."
"2050670","2057350"," I really want to see Tesla break their localized support going back the past month which they did"
"2057350","2057929"," not do. "
"2060230","2066090"," I want to see them break a trend and I'm not seeing I need to see that trend break."
"2067130","2073150"," And by not seeing that trend break it's of concern right for the bear case."
"2073150","2083150"," I want to see the bloodbath in the in the retail"
"2083150","2084870"," favorite speculative growth stocks. "
"2085350","2089730"," You know it's still not answering the question about brainard yesterday either."
"2089770","2094330"," You're like the brain like I get what brainard is saying and I get that it's being used for a"
"2094330","2095130"," market reaction."
"2095690","2099050"," And then yesterday at five p.m. after market close. "
"2099990","2104150"," I saw news articles flooding the market saying that."
"2104150","2107950"," They that the Senate wants to request big tech."
"2108790","2112850"," To about over the January or June or I don't remember what that was but. "
"2113270","2116030"," The insurrection plot shit that took place the White House."
"2116670","2120890"," Just saying that they want big tech to have Senate hearings again."
"2121470","2125770"," And earlier in the day I was talking to markets and mayhem live on air about it. "
"2126350","2128510"," Is like are we looking for the are using."
"2129330","2133950"," We lose using rates and some other news stories to dump the market."
"2134790","2139370"," More so than it really impacting because I'm like man if the rates really were going to impact the"
"2139370","2139630"," market. "
"2140270","2141190"," Or if."
"2142270","2144450"," Tightening was going to really impact the market."
"2144850","2148710"," Man I swear you would see a you would something you would see a death spiral. "
"2149130","2151650"," If if we were going to stop bond bond purchases."
"2151650","2155630"," So we did sell off above here at four sixty four."
"2156030","2159230"," Four sixty four or four sixty four ninety nine four sixty four. "
"2159550","2160750"," Excuse me four sixty five."
"2161530","2163650"," And we've bounced off slightly down below here."
"2164130","2167930"," The WAP right now on spy is four sixty one ninety four. "
"2172340","2173640"," We're going to get Tesla real quick."
"2174620","2176660"," And sure enough we had news articles yesterday."
"2177900","2180960"," We had news articles yesterday and on Tesla. "
"2180960","2182720"," Not Tesla Facebook."
"2183380","2185500"," I think Microsoft Apple."
"2186440","2194760"," That came out around five p.m. So I guess this is the stuff we have to watch for right"
"2194760","2197980"," every time we hear the that news used in a negative light. "
"2198560","2201860"," It'll just be used to dump these stocks right slowly trade them down."
"2202360","2208260"," Because they're not getting the effect or impact that they're looking for from saying rates are"

"2235620","2237460"," to sell down these big tickers. "
"2237460","2242250"," So Tesla's on VWAP right now 1028."
"2243110","2248150"," Still that same support at one thousand and nine ninety it looks like we have more support firming"
"2248150","2248390"," up."
"2248910","2254190"," If you guys are scared about your Tesla will look lower and see where the next by the dip area"

"2334780","2339420"," Give a big drop down to eight hundred and then down here seven fifty. "
"2339940","2341540"," You know eight hundred looks like a nice level."
"2341600","2343440"," I keep saying this seven fifty number down here."
"2343580","2347200"," It's more than likely going to be like eight hundred if the market sells off. "
"2347880","2350320"," Feel that market sell off between now and March."
"2351260","2352560"," It's probably somewhere down here."
"2353820","2354960"," After he is done. "
"2356660","2362140"," We'll have these news stories coming out saying that we don't expect growth to sustain itself."

"2397000","2401660"," You'll see Mike Wilson will drag him back out and he'll say something to you like well. "
"2404340","2410920"," We expect decent profits in tech this year and then you'll see a bounce market will bounce."
"2412520","2418240"," And then you'll see you know we'll go for Tesla go from seven fifty to two thousand in the year."

"2444700","2447200"," Like the bulls hate me and the bears hate me. "
"2447660","2449180"," The bears are like no dammit."
"2449600","2451700"," We're selling down because it's the end of the world."
"2452320","2454380"," And then the bulls are like we'll never sell down. "
"2454380","2459260"," And in reality it's just you know accumulation and then profit taking."
"2459940","2463040"," And then do it all rinse and repeat until you break it all."
"2463520","2473500"," Oh yeah so I'm staying long in my my lungs if I can if I can. "
"2474080","2476940"," What I'm going to look for on my lungs is."
"2477680","2478660"," I really need."
"2479660","2483200"," I really need our our spy to. "
"2484120","2494000"," Make a move before eleven a.m. And sometimes as late as one p.m. Because"
"2494000","2496720"," the market makers will just strip any value off."
"2498320","2500440"," Of fd's at some point this morning."
"2502160","2505200"," So I'm going to look I'm going to try to get another bounce out of this. "
"2506960","2509020"," If not I'll just cut my losses here."
"2509020","2513040"," Yeah I'm already down to eight cents they were up to like twelve or thirteen cents at one point."
"2513440","2515580"," So the market makers are already stepping in right here. "
"2516160","2519160"," And trying to skim profit out of the market."
"2520380","2521900"," No matter where we're sitting right here."
"2522000","2526180"," So I'm going to look for one more push above if we can break above forty six four fifty. "
"2526740","2527540"," I'll stay in."
"2528000","2530420"," If you can't break in here I'm just going to take cut my losses."
"2531140","2533540"," And I'll try to re enter again at some point. "
"2534260","2537420"," Maybe now we're at the two two o'clock three o'clock hour."
"2537500","2538800"," Possibly at the four o'clock hour."
"2542940","2544580"," And I'm going to scroll back through here. "
"2544980","2549280"," And I will go back above to find out some tickers you guys want to be seeing."
"2551400","2555000"," See what I can find out for for shout outs you guys were given this morning."
"2557200","2558360"," So I did Q come. "
"2558860","2560220"," I'll do our K for you guys."
"2562420","2564480"," Saw a bunch of people asking about our K."
"2579030","2582330"," Yes or congrats to the Bears Bears made great money off that trade."
"2582990","2583970"," Or I hope you did. "
"2585730","2589390"," I made some money and puts yesterday not what I was hoping to make."
"2589490","2590590"," I only made like a hundred percent."
"2591990","2595030"," This morning my puts made only like fifty percent. "
"2595190","2596750"," I was a little too far outside the money."
"2598450","2601950"," I was hoping for a bloodbath this morning like straight up bloodbath."
"2606840","2609620"," Yeah, so right here at this four sixty four thirty nine. "
"2610140","2611420"," If we can break through here."
"2611480","2612860"," There's a lot of calls coming into the market."
"2614060","2619040"," The there were more sellers than buyers more sellers than buyers this morning. "
"2620040","2622520"," But the buyers are coming up right."
"2622960","2627920"," You've got a the ratio of buyers to sellers is getting stronger."
"2628280","2631540"," And I'm assuming at some point bears will take the money and run. "
"2633280","2634700"," We are going into a weekend."
"2635380","2636900"," I would be hesitant."
"2637300","2640880"," I'm going to think about some FTS but I'm always hesitant of buying FTS. "
"2642020","2646060"," Either direction puts or calls when you have three days off in the market."
"2646360","2647600"," We're closed for three days."
"2647800","2649160"," I'm going skiing this weekend too. "
"2649820","2652400"," So hopefully you guys can get out there and have a wonderful weekend."
"2654460","2658000"," But I'm always concerned with the theta burn over the weekend."
"2658000","2661100"," If you're going to buy puts or calls unless we do a gap. "
"2661100","2666260"," A serious gap down or a serious gap up over the weekend and you're looking like serious."
"2666320","2668440"," You're looking for like fifty to a hundred points minimum."
"2669960","2672040"," For any side of those to print. "
"2672940","2678380"," Then I would say take spreads definitely take spreads and also look at the E."
"2678500","2679260"," I posted yesterday."
"2680420","2681920"," E hours for the rest of the month."
"2682420","2687540"," Take a look at E hours that are that are happening on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. "
"2687540","2692320"," And how those might impact your positioning into the end of day today."
"2696980","2698260"," So I want to bring up RK."
"2708450","2709870"," So the RK crowd is looking. "
"2710130","2712610"," We've got some ice above here at eighty two eighty one."
"2712990","2714270"," Be conscious of that."
"2715170","2717790"," I still want to see RK like sixty five bucks. "
"2719010","2721250"," I'm a buyer at sixty five dollars or so."
"2721510","2725690"," I think we will see sixty five dollars before end of spring time."
"2726910","2730050"," You also have yeah it's eighty three eighty two eighty six. "
"2730850","2731410"," On RK."
"2732450","2734830"," And I'm a fan of what I should say that."
"2736730","2740790"," I think the selling down of RK is more natural than it seems. "
"2741870","2747530"," They have to make negative news about Kathy and trash Kathy to bring RK down to sixty five bucks or"
"2747530","2747770"," so."
"2748530","2753950"," But it wouldn't shock me to see these same news organizations flip their script."
"2753950","2758910"," As soon as I start to hear the more as soon as I start to hear the really bad RK"
"2758910","2759210"," news. "
"2760110","2762290"," I want to be hearing like it's going to go bankrupt."
"2763030","2763730"," That kind of stuff."
"2764130","2766350"," Then I'm going to look to start taking longs in RK. "
"2768050","2772010"," Otherwise the book maps really not showing too much information."
"2772650","2775750"," You have more buyers and sellers right now on RK."
"2776150","2779070"," I can add the add-ons and see if it works. "
"2783400","2786240"," I'm not a net or a Kathy Woods hater either."
"2786580","2788680"," I just think it's a matter of taking profit."
"2789800","2795420"," So whenever I hear the negative news I don't interpret it the same way. "
"2796100","2797560"," Here indicator is positive."
"2798280","2801940"," Looks like the next batch of the next round of selling more than likely is at eighty two ninety"
"2801940","2802280"," two."
"2802920","2806980"," If the bulls think they can take that they can beat this eighty two ninety two. "
"2807700","2809640"," You got more sellers above eighty three bucks."
"2810500","2813660"," It is good to see that there are no sellers above here."
"2814360","2816640"," We're almost at that capitulation level. "
"2816640","2822640"," You've got another round of bag holders above at serious bag holders above at eighty nine eighty"
"2822640","2823060"," two."
"2823320","2825760"," This is really the group right here you want to see sell."
"2827260","2829040"," You want to see this group right here. "
"2829960","2834280"," Finally have some capitulation of those last diamond handers."
"2834780","2836120"," Those brick handed bulls."
"2838940","2843060"," We'll look below to see why I keep saying sixty five bucks. "
"2843860","2846280"," We'll see if that's a real number or not right now."
"2847460","2850460"," Let's take a look below and see where the real real banks are at."
"2850600","2851800"," Where do the banks want to buy RK?"
"2852860","2854880"," I don't believe that they don't want to buy it. "
"2855020","2856860"," I just think that they have a different number than we do."
"2857900","2862020"," We have a stop here at seventy five seventy five eleven."
"2868180","2870560"," Right here is some nice supported seventy bucks. "
"2871420","2872320"," And this seems about right."
"2872820","2873460"," You see this right here."
"2874180","2875080"," Like seventy dollars. "
"2876020","2878320"," So if you're a bull on if you're like a long term."
"2878900","2879800"," Our cable."
"2882260","2883220"," You're going to be waiting. "
"2887720","2890520"," This is the this is that seven fifty level on Tesla."
"2891300","2893400"," I don't know what this I don't know that I get this this year."
"2893980","2896160"," Maybe for a brief moment sixty six fifty. "
"2896780","2904170"," Looks like the real support on on RK is roughly seventy bucks."
"2904910","2908710"," Somewhere in here I'm looking for this event to take place down the road."
"2909390","2910890"," Sometime between now and March. "
"2922820","2925740"," Well you're trying to get all the tickers you guys are calling out."
"2928320","2935100"," TQ you're going to do TQ what's TQ TQ or TQ QQ or TQ QQ QQ."
"2935840","2937600"," Is there an actual ticker TQ?"
"2938340","2938940"," No. "
"2940380","2941580"," You bastards."
"2944580","2946580"," Yeah Emmy was scary wasn't it?"
"2947740","2948540"," I took a look at me."
"2949220","2954620"," I looked at Emmy this morning to the that I was looking through my stocks that I'm watching. "
"2954620","2956080"," We'll check Emmy for you."
"2959200","2960900"," And me was at a nice bottom yesterday."
"2961860","2963200"," I looked at that this morning. "
"2966920","2968560"," By the dip five oh one."
"2973450","2974290"," Gorgeous support."
"2974950","2978230"," You've got some ice above at five seventy seven six nineteen. "
"2979450","2980490"," Looks like they're weak though."
"2980490","2982410"," Six ninety six is a nice price."
"2984010","2985510"," Where the real seller's at. "
"2986850","2990410"," Real sellers on Emmy are at nine fifty one."
"2991030","2992270"," That's a really nice trade."
"2993450","2994650"," I like that trade yesterday. "
"2996830","2998050"," We'll look at Uber next."
"3010270","3012270"," That was a ticker for Brad Kessner."
"3012810","3013270"," Brad Kay. "
"3017990","3022170"," Lots of support firming up down here at four sixty now on the spy."
"3023010","3026510"," This this band has tightened up a little bit down here for sixty."
"3027110","3030730"," Here indicator is good on the spy. "
"3031430","3033550"," Just grinding through these sellers above here."
"3034170","3035450"," Looked like these are late bears."
"3035770","3039890"," Maybe if I had to guess these are bears that are wanting to jump in short. "
"3040250","3041210"," Take it down to four fifty."
"3041710","3042610"," Drink in the Kool-Aid."
"3043630","3044610"," Late to the party. "
"3044610","3047910"," I'm going to expect that we trade sideways here and grind out these sellers."
"3048990","3050110"," And make our way higher."
"3054400","3055140"," Look at Uber. "
"3055840","3058520"," Uber is just smashing and bashing down below here."
"3059680","3060720"," This might be a good one."
"3066130","3067310"," I like the Uber trade. "
"3067810","3069430"," I've traded Uber this year a few times."
"3071150","3073230"," Uber's had some very I like Uber right here."
"3074010","3075770"," It's got some negative gamma on it right now. "
"3077150","3079330"," But it is bashing down here on support."
"3080030","3081810"," You are looking for about fifty bucks."
"3082290","3083990"," You've got some sellers at forty six. "
"3084850","3086130"," Forty five seventy five."
"3087190","3090570"," If the bears were really to take charge here in Uber."
"3092070","3095170"," This is another ticker that I'm watching for January to March. "
"3102650","3104150"," I don't know if it can go much lower."
"3104950","3106750"," This will be worth the watch here."
"3107350","3110270"," Uber's really worth the watch here because all the buyers. "
"3112830","3116470"," You've got very light buyers down below at thirty five bucks."
"3118150","3121770"," But right now Uber seems to be, this is a really nice leap of trade."
"3122430","3124030"," It's a really nice, I like this trade a lot. "
"3124710","3125090"," I like Uber."
"3125510","3126510"," I can't say that I don't."
"3127290","3130890"," I'm not saying that Uber can't dip down below forty bucks either. "
"3131550","3134110"," But I do like this trade generally for where it's at."
"3136480","3138820"," Even if we were to sell down, I still like it."
"3140480","3142600"," I don't think Uber goes down to ten bucks maybe. "
"3143380","3144640"," But I don't think it does."
"3145040","3146080"," This is like Peton."
"3146520","3148240"," It's close to its bottom. "
"3148880","3150080"," Not quite in its bottom."
"3150380","3152600"," I think Peton can trade down like ten bucks."
"3154020","3156640"," But I don't think that Peton is the same as Uber. "
"3159260","3160840"," I don't think they're the same company."
"3161360","3162960"," I don't think that Peton's growth."
"3164680","3167520"," Will in any way be the shape or form be the same as Uber. "
"3167880","3169500"," Or it's relevant to the general public."
"3170340","3171260"," So I kind of like Uber here."
"3171640","3172660"," Or even more so than Peton. "
"3174300","3175160"," And that's where it too."
"3175240","3177400"," I can't really compare Peton with Square either."
"3178980","3182600"," I'm looking at Peton trading where I want SQ to trade. "
"3183640","3186980"," But Peton's not the same company as Peton either."
"3188400","3189140"," That one's good."
"3190440","3192160"," And then we'll see what else you guys are doing. "
"3193720","3194840"," I did Tesla for you."
"3195240","3195880"," Good morning Joe."
"3198100","3200420"," Your wife's boyfriend I'll do ASO for you next. "
"3201360","3204520"," Sorry I'm a little bit behind this morning and doing tickers for you guys."
"3205880","3206720"," How are you Joe?"
"3208320","3213020"," Joe last night I was down the rabbit hole again."
"3215600","3217480"," Joe's been on the rabbit hole working on the website. "
"3217920","3219740"," Looks like some people have found it already."
"3221020","3223100"," Some internet sleuths have found the website."
"3226390","3227770"," And man discord. "
"3228690","3230210"," I've got like webhook issues."
"3230930","3233490"," I've got I was trying to put you guys to find this funny."
"3233790","3234910"," To me out there we'll find this funny. "
"3234910","3235810"," So."
"3237070","3240390"," I was putting in a bot right like a server bot."
"3241590","3246790"," And the server bot asks for you know do you want to ban certain words. "
"3247670","3250530"," I'm like well I don't really want to ban the F bomb."
"3250810","3252050"," I don't want to ban the S bomb."
"3253070","3255330"," But I can ban people that use it excessively. "
"3255630","3258430"," So like if you just say fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck."
"3259310","3261330"," You know it'll it'll just delete your message."
"3263570","3268690"," If you use all caps for more than 70% of what you're typing it'll ban not ban you. "
"3268710","3269890"," It'll just delete the message."
"3270590","3272890"," If you use too many emojis you can put a ban."
"3273030","3274590"," Not a ban but a delete message on that. "
"3275230","3276510"," Some of that stuff seems okay."
"3277590","3279150"," But I don't ban anybody that's going to swear."
"3280590","3285010"," But then of course my wife is like nope there are some swear words you don't want in there. "
"3286930","3291290"," And I'm like oh yeah there probably are some drill derogatory words you don't want used."
"3293030","3295170"," And there's no list of those those words."
"3295730","3297130"," And I don't know all those words. "
"3297510","3299870"," So I'm trying to Google search those words last night."
"3301630","3305650"," And no one no one has a list of those words because I can't remember them."
"3305710","3306350"," I don't know what they are. "
"3306770","3313210"," But it's interesting that how the bots work for discord because they're often built for so I"
"3313210","3314550"," finally find a list last night."
"3316890","3321670"," And if it tracks like what kids use for derogatory words."
"3322810","3326830"," And their craftiness to beat negative word filters. "
"3328130","3335270"," So that was an interesting experience last night to try to find words that are derogatory to put on"
"3335270","3335810"," a ban list."
"3336070","3338490"," Once you don't ever want to hear anyone saying or talking about."
"3340970","3343590"," My mother would wash my mouth out of fight. "
"3343650","3344590"," I ever said some of these things."
"3344950","3346430"," It was horrible to look these words out too."
"3347430","3349030"," And then you're like oh yeah I can't have that word. "
"3349430","3350690"," I definitely can't use that word."
"3350690","3352850"," I don't want to be the word police either."
"3353290","3359230"," But you know there's just some things that are destructive to anybody. "
"3360530","3362730"," But that was a really terrible thing not to get out and do yesterday."
"3363070","3370050"," And then the other thing on discord that I went through yesterday was I was having my wife go"
"3370050","3377510"," through yesterday and test different subs out or channels out to see what abilities she had and"
"3377510","3378090"," didn't have."
"3378870","3380450"," And I've got her using this. "
"3380630","3382710"," I've got this old computer that I've got her using."
"3384390","3387150"," And in one of the voice channels I was having problems."
"3387670","3391370"," And it wound up being the actual computers fault and not discords. "
"3391790","3395230"," But that took me like an hour to try to figure out technically what was going on."
"3395670","3398670"," I feel like I'm like I'm 50 or 60 years old here."
"3399030","3401930"," You're an old man trying to figure out the underbelly of discord. "
"3405460","3406900"," But this court's coming along."
"3407360","3415540"," I worked out a nice stockpot yesterday and put it through the paces last night for unusual options"
"3415540","3416100"," activity."
"3416740","3419700"," Stock charts a bunch of different command lines. "
"3421060","3424340"," And I haven't built the channels for that stockpot yet."
"3424560","3432280"," But you should have the ability to have the ability to be able to bring up certain charting"
"3432280","3435560"," options, unusual flows, all kinds of different stuff."
"3435820","3441140"," And then I'm able to post some flow from flow. "
"3441280","3441880"," I'll go in there."
"3443000","3447400"," I'll be able to post a bunch of stuff on Twitter and have a channel dedicated to that kind of"
"3447400","3447640"," stuff."
"3448540","3450000"," And I'm almost ready to get. "
"3450220","3454580"," I almost have the audio channels up and ready to go to host guys like markets and mayhem."
"3455100","3456960"," We can host people on this show."
"3458000","3461160"," Any of you guys out there that ever want to do a guest spot or talk. "
"3461160","3463780"," And we could probably even at some point."
"3464740","3469660"," Do an audio show with all of us live streaming on YouTube if you want to."
"3469740","3470940"," I don't know if everybody was into that. "
"3471060","3473460"," But that's some people are wallflowers."
"3474600","3475140"," Okay."
"3475260","3478720"," So ASO support 38 to 37. "
"3480220","3482280"," Got more sellers and buyers out."
"3482440","3484460"," I'm not really bullish on ASO right now."
"3484460","3489140"," You have sellers, some firm sellers above at 43. "
"3490440","3490960"," 44."
"3491160","3495650"," This looks like a bearish stance right now."
"3495670","3497630"," You got and more sellers above at 49. "
"3498690","3500230"," This looks like localized support though."
"3500350","3501030"," I'll give you that."
"3502250","3504110"," Localized support at 37. "
"3506390","3512280"," I'm concerned that this isn't a larger band of buyers."
"3512600","3518150"," And this looks like it could sell down deeply."
"3519150","3522570"," It could have a capitulation move down to like $34. "
"3523250","3524250"," If you can handle that."
"3532100","3536800"," It'd be slightly wary on slightly wary on ASO."
"3554160","3555000"," LVS. "
"3557980","3560000"," I've been tracking LVS too."
"3561180","3564400"," It was interesting watching."
"3564840","3566340"," I've been watching DKNG. "
"3566340","3571520"," There's a talk out there that one of these online gaming companies is going to go under."
"3572300","3575000"," Like my first thought says maybe it's pet national gaming."
"3575800","3579260"," And I'm like, man, what if it's one of the ones that we don't think is going to go under?"
"3581860","3582260"," Yeah. "
"3582580","3583500"," We're going to look right there."
"3585840","3586800"," So look at LVS."
"3591850","3593270"," The LVS is on a negative. "
"3594810","3596550"," Get more buyers here in LVS."
"3598410","3601790"," Or bashing off of some resistance above at $44."
"3604930","3606470"," More sellers than buyers. "
"3607310","3609010"," Lots of call buyers in LVS."
"3611110","3612430"," It's an interesting one."
"3613510","3614490"," I like it where it is. "
"3616790","3620550"," Let's see if there's any kind of a deep capitulation move again left for LVS."
"3621550","3623430"," Looks like 35 bucks is by the dip."
"3624630","3625770"," $41 by the dip. "
"3629150","3629810"," Set an alert."
"3629990","3630990"," If it doesn't come, you missed it."
"3631130","3635030"," But if it does come, if once again, you get another sell down. "
"3635870","3637230"," 35 bucks is the by the dip."
"3638130","3642230"," If you're already in it, $35, you're at your first resistance level."
"3643570","3644890"," You can see it right here, right?"
"3645310","3648990"," Massive resistance between $43 and $46. "
"3650750","3653510"," I'll look above here and see if there's any price targets above."
"3655680","3656390"," I don't see any."
"3656910","3657370"," Yeah. "
"3657810","3658650"," I like LVS here."
"3660430","3664850"," I just have to wear out all these sellers between here and $46."
"3665530","3668050"," If not, you come back to 35 to try again. "
"3673260","3674060"," All right."
"3674780","3675580"," I did XLF."
"3675760","3676440"," I did XBI. "
"3678660","3679660"," Let's see here."
"3681600","3684480"," Amazon paid well today."
"3685300","3686020"," LOL, huh?"
"3686760","3688660"," I didn't, I missed the must have missed something on Amazon. "
"3689480","3690000"," I'll do Amazon."
"3690380","3690740"," Next, you guys."
"3690840","3691260"," I'm going to do Amazon. "
"3691760","3693020"," I see three Amazon's here."
"3696000","3696860"," I ain't tight."
"3699660","3701880"," I'll look at, let me look at Amazon for you guys. "
"3705600","3706320"," Amazon ZN."
"3709740","3710100"," Subscribe."
"3714480","3715800"," Anyway, go and ski in this weekend. "
"3716800","3720380"," We're going out hiking, biking, surfing, sailing."
"3721660","3723820"," Got two buddies already away on vacation."
"3733860","3737500"," Let me check Flow Algo this morning to see if anything's coming up for you guys. "
"3742120","3748120"," Seeing X calls, X-ray calls, February 18, 29C."
"3750360","3752480"," Seeing some airline puts this morning."
"3759570","3762150"," TQQ calls came in this morning. "
"3763570","3764890"," Those are kind of late now."
"3765190","3765850"," Test the calls."
"3767350","3770530"," Spy calls, Ford calls, F."
"3772170","3772950"," Lots of Ford calls. "
"3777190","3780050"," Seeing a mixed bag on airline calls this morning."
"3782130","3782470"," CVX."
"3784050","3787490"," I like that January 28th, 135C. "
"3788290","3790530"," Win, W-Y-N-N."
"3791030","3792430"," That's a gambling stock."
"3792950","3794430"," January 28th, 98C. "
"3795410","3797350"," Lots of wind calls coming in this morning."
"3798010","3798930"," I would target wind."
"3799170","3800330"," We're going to look up wind right now. "
"3802210","3804430"," UCO, U-C-O."
"3805150","3807110"," January 21st, 110C."
"3807710","3808910"," That's another high algo score. "
"3809450","3812870"," So look up UCO and we'll look up wind really quick."
"3817320","3821380"," When I interject before checking your tickers after Amazon for a moment."
"3823560","3826480"," Here indicator is negative on Amazon. "
"3826880","3832120"," We have more, we have more set, way more sellers and buyers this morning on Amazon."
"3833780","3836200"," It's coming right back down to that 3,200 left."
"3836960","3838260"," All the dip buyers love. "
"3841550","3842950"," Let's see if we can take a look and see."
"3845870","3850250"," We'll check and we'll check and see if there's actually still support down here."
"3850250","3854610"," The bulls love buying this 3,200 level. "
"3857200","3859260"," XLE calls coming in this morning."
"3859840","3861580"," BA calls coming in this morning."

"3867480","3869440"," All those tech calls came rolling through."
"3871240","3872720"," No, hold on."
"3873100","3878460"," Baidu had calls coming this morning, 160C for April 14th on Baidu. "
"3879080","3880760"," I like that call expansion."
"3886670","3890650"," We've got some VIX VXX, VIX puts coming in."
"3892390","3896610"," Yep, so you get support down here at 3,200, 3,150. "
"3903350","3905930"," Let's see what the next level down is."
"3907010","3912730"," It looks like 3,150 and 3,120 is some serious support for Amazon."
"3913190","3913890"," I expect that. "
"3915550","3917310"," Let's look at wind real quick."
"3917310","3920190"," I want to see if wind is just ripping today or not."
"3925240","3926880"," Why so many calls on wind?"
"3928960","3930020"," What was the other one?"
"3930820","3932300"," I'll check X as well. "
"3932960","3935460"," There's massive calls coming in on X right now."
"3936500","3937020"," Massive."
"3937720","3940280"," All February 18th, 29C. "
"3945080","3947260"," What was the other one that I saw down here?"
"3951300","3953080"," I'll check Ford."
"3958270","3960770"," There's one down here that looks really nice."
"3963630","3964210"," Yuko. "
"3965730","3969250"," I'll check Win X and Yuko."
"3969590","3971230"," You see, check them too."
"3974250","3977490"," Win X Ford Yuko. "
"3979550","3981090"," Bring those up on your charts."
"3981090","3983490"," Win X Ford and Yuko."
"4006450","4008870"," The wind calls are 100 C's. "
"4018280","4019760"," Lots of resistance up here."
"4020660","4023060"," A lot of grinding to get to 100 C here."
"4023940","4027260"," Lots of resistance at 95, 98, 100. "
"4038360","4042760"," By the dip, you've got 70 bucks, 81 bucks."
"4042760","4046410"," It's going to be a tough one right here."
"4046910","4047910"," Might be a VWAP trade. "
"4049710","4054370"," But you do have buyers overwhelming sellers this morning on win."
"4054890","4056430"," That's good to note at least."
"4057230","4060150"," You've got double the buyers as you do have sellers. "
"4060790","4063430"," I could rip up to 100 bucks, maybe 96, 98."
"4064950","4068770"," Maybe you hold it to $97 if you're in win."
"4070090","4071590"," We're going to look up X next. "
"4072930","4073770"," Then Ford."
"4096020","4099359"," Take a look into the closer look at the spy."
"4106830","4108250"," It's a better look at spy, right?"
"4109729","4112210"," You have buyers overwhelming sellers on the spy right now. "
"4113290","4114670"," Positive hero indicator."
"4115609","4116590"," We'll bring up the hero indicator."
"4117350","4118529"," Expand it a little bit so you can take a peek. "
"4123160","4124800"," See what the hero indicator is doing."
"4126340","4129460"," We've got some slight divergence here on the hero indicator."
"4130160","4134040"," We've got a 1035, even though it's showing positive. "
"4136359","4137840"," I'm stabilizing a little bit."
"4139040","4140920"," It was this where this little dip took place."
"4142880","4144479"," We'll monitor spy. "
"4147140","4148340"," Hold on here."
"5476180","5476660"," Shit."
"5477040","5478840"," My microphone was off. "
"5479780","5480380"," Goddamn it."
"5480680","5481160"," Oops."
"5481460","5482620"," Sorry for saying goddamn it. "
"5483180","5485220"," I've been talking for like the past 20 minutes."
"5485300","5486760"," You guys can't hear a goddamn thing."
"5487200","5488780"," My chat was locked up too. "
"5488840","5489540"," I couldn't see anything."
"5490280","5491840"," I couldn't see what you guys were saying."
"5492280","5493580"," I just went through a whole bunch of charts. "
"5494280","5494760"," Hilarious."
"5498220","5498700"," Hilarious."
"5499560","5500040"," Yeah. "
"5500300","5502900"," So my chat was."
"5503540","5504520"," Like frozen."
"5505080","5506920"," So I was like way above in the chat. "
"5507580","5509240"," And I couldn't see shit."
"5509760","5511580"," And all I see now I'm scrolling through it."
"5511640","5513400"," I see all these like red warning signs. "
"5514180","5515080"," This is hilarious."
"5518220","5519200"," Too hilarious."
"5520460","5521820"," Let me scroll back up again. "
"5522660","5523260"," So I had the."
"5524000","5524980"," So I had the."
"5526400","5527500"," Mike was off. "
"5528020","5529500"," And the chat was stuck."
"5530480","5533360"," So sometimes OBS streamlabs does a good job."
"5533500","5534560"," And sometimes it does not. "
"5538100","5540280"," Did you guys hear me say that I'm going skiing this weekend?"
"5540820","5544640"," Hopefully you guys are all out there surfing, hiking, biking and skiing."
"5548700","5549980"," Hope you guys heard that part."
"5550880","5551340"," I'm going skiing. "
"5551520","5551740"," Oh yeah."
"5551940","5553320"," Everybody's going skiing this weekend right on."
"5555900","5557860"," Joe Harper saying it's going to snow here on Sunday. "
"5558080","5559640"," I missed the whole bunch where you guys were saying too."
"5560140","5562880"," I just curled back up and I see all the shit you guys were texting."
"5563860","5565080"," Karaoke sounds like a blast. "
"5566820","5567280"," Yeah."
"5567380","5570380"," Joe Harper if it's going to snow where you are definitely going to shut the city down."
"5573000","5573460"," Ooh. "
"5573540","5576160"," Doughboy capital is going flying to Canada."
"5576280","5577020"," It goes cat skiing."
"5577640","5578920"," I love cat skiing. "
"5579840","5580500"," Love it."
"5587060","5588000"," Yeah, Jason."
"5588160","5589760"," I'm not a fan of unusual whales. "
"5589760","5591040"," I'll go."
"5591480","5592780"," You know, it doesn't hit everything."
"5593560","5596440"," But it definitely is more focused. "
"5598620","5599060"," Yeah."
"5599280","5600060"," UCO is oil."
"5602280","5603980"," I just went through a bunch of tickers. "
"5604300","5605540"," I'm not going through them again."
"5605780","5606220"," Sorry guys."
"5612070","5612510"," Yeah. "
"5613370","5614630"," So when was weird."
"5614970","5618290"," I don't know if you guys heard me talk about when I don't like the wind chart."
"5618690","5621350"," I don't like any of the charts that I showed earlier. "
"5622610","5626010"," There's a lot of flow coming into these tickers, but I don't like where they are."
"5626750","5627930"," I talked to some."
"5628150","5631230"," It's kind of funny because I was talking for the bears out there. "
"5631610","5633790"," You guys do need to hear that part of the conversation."
"5634650","5637270"," There was some hedging that came in today."
"5639630","5643130"," So all the consumer cyclicals, the consumer defensive stocks. "
"5644450","5648250"," We haven't seen any hedging activity coming in on those tickers."
"5648630","5649710"," They came in today."
"5649710","5652050"," So you saw Kroger puts coming in. "
"5653610","5655590"," Saw some retail."
"5656430","5657890"," Let me bring these back up for you guys."
"5660070","5661730"," Saw Kroger puts come in today. "
"5662070","5666190"," This morning at 6 a.m., I was looking up the Kroger chart because it's been going up since."
"5668110","5668550"," 2019."
"5671280","5674220"," And I was interested because Kroger went up yesterday. "
"5674600","5676220"," It had a huge move the other day."
"5678530","5681230"," Kroger, I think yesterday was up like 14%."
"5681910","5684070"," But I'm expecting Kroger to come down. "
"5684370","5687970"," It never traded down since since 2019."
"5688250","5691970"," It actually got pushed up really high in March 2020."
"5692290","5693730"," So the Kroger trade. "
"5694110","5697150"," I was looking at that because of how high it was up yesterday."
"5700170","5701370"," Just cranking."
"5702630","5705650"," And we saw Kroger hedge come in for March 18. "
"5707510","5709570"," 98p for a million dollars."
"5710420","5712490"," And if you follow its trend line all the way up."
"5713090","5716010"," I'm looking for Kroger to trade down to at least 43 bucks. "
"5716710","5719830"," And it showed major support on Kroger at 43."
"5721590","5728310"," Seeing hedging come in on consumer defensive and retail stocks right now currently."
"5728930","5734930"," Expiring on March 18 makes me think that you're going to get that capitulation move that we're"
"5734930","5737090"," looking for into March at some point. "
"5737830","5740970"," And so you're seeing it on on on on KR."
"5741470","5743250"," And then you're also seeing on XRT."
"5744530","5747310"," XRT is showing support at 80 bucks. "
"5747350","5755410"," But if we break through by price target for XRT is 71.33. So our million dollars and puts come"
"5755410","5758970"," in for March 18 on XRT and KR this morning."
"5759790","5764690"," I haven't seen any other hedges coming in on all the bulls that are hiding out in these defensive"
"5764690","5765390"," stocks."
"5765390","5769490"," But we are looking for that for that kind of hedging coming into the market. "
"5770010","5775510"," So you'll find all these bulls are hiding out inside of consumer defensive health care."
"5776190","5782170"," And you know the small corner of the market and you really want that last capitulation move to"
"5782170","5786390"," include the sell off of the retail defensive stocks."
"5787070","5788470"," Consumer defensive stocks. "
"5789490","5791550"," Material stocks any of that kind of stuff."
"5791550","5795490"," Also I looked at X this morning for that retail trade."
"5795990","5799290"," The retail calls that came out on X this morning don't look promising. "
"5799710","5801330"," Just looks like retail FOMO."
"5801710","5803370"," I don't like the trade in UCO."
"5804390","5805990"," Unless it pulls back to 98. "
"5806970","5810370"," I don't like the trade in when either."
"5812320","5816120"," I don't like the trade in who was the other one that I looked at this morning."
"5817440","5819060"," I think there's one more. "
"5819060","5823660"," All right so we'll get past all that for right now."
"5824140","5825200"," And we'll look at."
"5828420","5829300"," Yeah I'm muted. "
"5830920","5832680"," No sound is because I was muted."
"5836810","5838370"," Now I'm going to scroll back down through here."
"5839650","5841410"," The air is coming out. "
"5841590","5842770"," I got the sirens coming out."
"5844550","5845070"," Hahaha."
"5845810","5846330"," Hilarious. "
"5848470","5852190"," Yeah so Winky I was talking I was probably muted here Winky."
"5853370","5855090"," Massive puts coming in."
"5855090","5856890"," So the day traders they buy. "
"5856990","5860510"," They're buying 182 P on QCOM."
"5862670","5864130"," I have to go through all of this."
"5864250","5866070"," I can't believe that was muted on all this shit. "
"5866750","5868390"," I talked about QCOM when I was muted."
"5873720","5874900"," So QCOM right."
"5875200","5878520"," Right on time day traders take 182 P."
"5879260","5881820"," Expiring on January 14th. "
"5881920","5885240"," Run it back down to 180 170 and then pick it back up again."
"5888600","5893800"," Cup mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute mute."
"5894300","5894740"," Mute. "
"5898400","5899700"," Willy smoke have a great day."
"5899900","5900920"," Yeah I'm going to be bailing myself."
"5901240","5905200"," I'm looking for a place under the day trade at some point but I'm going skiing this weekend. "
"5912320","5915080"," He's given a lot of good information right now to know exactly what to do."
"5928190","5930870"," XRT ticker not needed better be just delisted."
"5935370","5937670"," Paul saying he's long MES at some point. "
"5937770","5938730"," That was probably a long time ago."
"5948390","5950390"," If you're taking hostage by the bears."
"5952510","5954270"," Bob I'll bring Bob up real quick. "
"5954510","5956490"," I saw that somebody wanted the Tesla chart."
"5957010","5958850"," They didn't want me showing Tesla porn anymore."
"5958970","5963530"," So we'll look at Tesla briefly and we'll do some Tesla porn for the bulls that are sad today. "
"5967930","5971150"," Okay you ready for the Tesla porn Tesla bull porn."
"5971150","5973130"," I know the Tesla bulls want us to porn."
"5975010","5977890"," Get negative gamma coming in or negative not gamma. "
"5978290","5980150"," Negative hero indicator on Tesla."
"5981110","5982370"," More sellers than buyers."
"5982770","5983270"," It is the weekend. "
"5983550","5984370"," People are going to take profit."
"5985230","5988170"," You're going to see some bulls that are going to get scared heading into Monday."
"5989810","5995810"," Apparently there are some hedges coming in though in retail and consumer defensive for March 18th. "
"5995970","5997410"," That does sound logical to me."
"5998450","6008310"," I posted on Twitter last week that I think Mike Wilson on MS said don't worry everybody."
"6009090","6010030"," It's ER season. "
"6010550","6011790"," The market should be fine."
"6012450","6017150"," I posted on Twitter I said I've seen many ER seasons where we've just sold the whole market as just"
"6017150","6018050"," from a technical perspective."
"6018390","6022910"," We've sold the whole entire market as we've released ERs. "
"6023110","6025770"," So I thought that didn't make any sense to hear him saying that."
"6026650","6028570"," Do I think that we're selling the market right now?"
"6029030","6031410"," Oh yeah I think from now into March we do."
"6031710","6035270"," I think we've already talked about that we've sold out in the March but I don't think that that"
"6035270","6038190"," stops us from going up at the same time. "
"6038530","6043370"," To see unreasonable rips up to 480 or 500 are certainly on the table at this time period."
"6043790","6047270"," That those large megaphones how we're trading within those large megaphones."
"6047570","6049790"," I don't think that's something we just keep rolling on. "
"6049870","6052830"," Well I think we do kind of keep rolling over at some point."
"6052830","6056050"," I'm hoping for that huge capitulation into March."
"6056090","6057410"," I hope it doesn't take until June. "
"6058890","6060590"," But I still haven't seen the signs of it."
"6060970","6062670"," We are seeing some of the signs of it though."
"6062930","6069310"," Seeing that Kroger position does show signs that they're going to come for the bulls hiding out in"
"6069310","6070110"," defensive stocks. "
"6070690","6073250"," So if you're a bull and you want to see some bull porn."
"6074130","6075730"," You want to see company X get announced."
"6075990","6077250"," You want to see a stock split get announced. "
"6078190","6079850"," So we already know about 1100 right."
"6079990","6081450"," That's been a big one everyone's been looking at."
"6082310","6088750"," Everybody likes the idea of the call wall on or they don't like the idea of the call wall on"
"6088750","6089370"," Tesla. "
"6090070","6091030"," And this is a big problem."
"6091610","6094510"," Someone was wanting me to show the upper ranges."
"6096450","6099970"," When you don't have call structure above like 1200 here. "
"6100330","6103130"," You won't see resistance levels way above."
"6103710","6109590"," You're not going to see like a seller at 1500 or anything like that."
"6109590","6111830"," You're going to see an actual call wall above. "
"6112770","6115130"," You see some up some up here at 1250."
"6118380","6120080"," You're going to see really light sellers."
"6120380","6123260"," You see some guy some guys living in a hermit hole somewhere. "
"6123640","6126680"," You know he's probably got one or two likes you got some guy."
"6126760","6129080"," You got some these are like the ultra bulls up here."
"6129560","6131400"," This is like the Mac. "
"6131600","6132980"," Why would I want to say Gary Black?"
"6133280","6135880"," But you got some ultra bulls that are like."
"6136340","6138100"," I ain't selling till 1300."
"6140680","6142380"," I ain't selling till 3000. "
"6142700","6144700"," I've got a I've got a sell order of my Tesla."
"6144940","6145740"," It's at 1300."
"6147640","6148520"," 14 1500. "
"6148960","6150160"," Got another markup here."
"6151020","6151460"," 1350."
"6153120","6154340"," We'll bring it up for the bulls. "
"6154500","6154920"," Make them happy."
"6155420","6156180"," Get them all excited."
"6161460","6162420"," Look at that 1400. "
"6162840","6163640"," How's that looking?"
"6165760","6166960"," How's this looking up here?"
"6167440","6168620"," So looking sexy for the bulls."
"6169080","6171220"," You guys want some bull porn for Tesla today."
"6172840","6173700"," So 1400. "
"6174840","6177340"," We've got we've got a Jim Bob up here."
"6177440","6179580"," He's like I ain't selling until 1450."
"6180000","6187660"," Look at that 1450 sexiness, right?"
"6189300","6190080"," I like it. "
"6190160","6192280"," You got 1450 and one guy goes, you know what?"
"6192900","6194160"," 1450 is not good enough."
"6194760","6197360"," I'm setting my cells at 1467, baby."
"6202570","6203750"," Up above 1400. "
"6204250","6207790"," We've got we've got the we've got the traders or the investors that have been told."
"6207790","6212110"," If they don't want their shares being used for shorting activity."
"6213010","6214770"," So you got like some guys like, you know what?"
"6214870","6219890"," I'm just going to set my my salad 1500 so they can't borrow my shares. "
"6221130","6223210"," It's an old wives tale, by the way."
"6224650","6230310"," Someone I think they used to purport that if you if you set your if you set your your stop"
"6230310","6232670"," losses at like 1500 1600."
"6233730","6240440"," That the brokers can't use your shares to short sell. "
"6240880","6242880"," I think I've heard that said before in the market."
"6243180","6245660"," I don't know if people still still purport that bullshit."
"6246000","6246320"," Look at this. "
"6246360","6247780"," You got a real ultra bull up here."
"6248240","6248640"," 1600."
"6248640","6252620"," Look at that massive 1600. "
"6253540","6254460"," Ball is a stale."
"6255120","6255880"," It's like I ain't selling."
"6256280","6257640"," It's like we're going to 2000, baby. "
"6258220","6259340"," We got a stock split coming."
"6263540","6265520"," Oh, look at the ultimate price target."
"6268780","6269200"," Ooh. "
"6273390","6274850"," This is where Elon's hanging out."
"6275370","6277490"," He's a guy in town until 1690."
"6279150","6280370"," That's all black up here. "
"6281250","6285110"," There's like no ice, no blue, no nothing, no noise."
"6285850","6287010"," Just hanging out up in the moon."
"6287190","6287930"," This is Mars, right?"
"6289030","6289450"," 1690. "
"6290090","6292250"," Like it's all fired up if you're if you're an uber bull."
"6294110","6295330"," You guys want to see 1700?"
"6299930","6301090"," You guys want to see it?"
"6302110","6303490"," We're getting all you getting all you."
"6303630","6303990"," Oh. "
"6306950","6308050"," Look at that."
"6309050","6309530"," 1800."
"6311970","6312450"," 1800. "
"6312830","6313690"," Look at that."
"6314210","6316610"," The elusive 1800."
"6316850","6318930"," Look at that sexy beast up there. "
"6322290","6322770"," Yeah."
"6322810","6322910"," Yeah."
"6322970","6327250"," I know it's a I know it's a wives tale, but I know that I know that the traders like"
"6327250","6331130"," all here investors become with all this other whack bullshit. "
"6333070","6336810"," They don't, you're crazy is they don't have to, they don't actually have to short tesla directly."
"6337650","6339430"," There's no point in short and tesla directly."
"6340830","6343870"," You short it through smaller funds. "
"6347470","6349210"," I shouldn't tell you guys this stuff."
"6350770","6352190"," Easiest way to short tesla."
"6352570","6354410"," So 1900 looks like a 2000. "
"6356670","6365150"," Easiest way to short tesla is through smaller ETFs that have a large."
"6367090","6368190"," There we go, baby."
"6368770","6369330"," 2000. "
"6370310","6371390"," Holy grail."
"6371470","6371950"," We're up above."
"6372870","6373730"," I like them apples. "
"6375050","6381010"," Easiest way to short tesla is to go into a small ETF that has a low float."
"6382350","6383870"," And give you push around easily."
"6385250","6387390"," But they control a shit ton of tesla stock. "
"6388310","6390470"," And you go in there and you short that thing down."
"6390710","6392010"," You just drive it, just pin it."
"6392930","6394470"," Just pin it, pin it, pin it. "
"6394570","6398650"," It's cheaper for hedge funds to pin these."
"6399950","6403610"," Pin these small ETFs that control a shit ton of tesla stock."
"6404430","6405270"," I got a video on this. "
"6405830","6408930"," I was done by a video that was done on this."
"6408930","6415030"," I see span video or something like that where there's a professor giving a talk about it."
"6415070","6420390"," A bunch of reporters were there and they were asking about how, like, why does tesla trade the way"
"6420390","6420810"," that it trades?"
"6421810","6423930"," If I can find it, I'll post it on social media. "
"6424970","6427110"," It's like an hour long or something, two hours long."
"6430250","6438190"," And it's very dangerous to, by the way, when hedge funds do this, it's how they get blown up in"
"6438190","6438530"," the background."
"6438530","6444530"," If you didn't know how hedge funds get blown up, it's from shorting in that manner. "
"6446370","6450450"," It leads to them sometimes when you see, if they're not prepared for a rip."
"6450650","6454670"," Like if tesla just said tomorrow, hey, we're announcing company X and we're going to split the"
"6454670","6455310"," stock 10 ways."
"6456370","6458090"," You'd see some hedge funds blow up. "
"6458610","6463790"," Not from directly shorting tesla, but from shorting these small hedge funds."
"6466920","6468740"," Which, of course, is always fun to watch."
"6469260","6472100"," It's always fun to watch a hedge fund blow up in my view. "
"6473000","6474300"," Okay, so we did the tesla thing."
"6474860","6475540"," I'm going to get out of there."
"6475580","6476580"," I'm going to get serious again. "
"6478840","6480980"," We'll take a look at the spy, see if it's bouncing around still."
"6481980","6484180"," It's kind of floating around sideways, just eating."
"6485100","6487320"," Tesla's going to consume puts and calls today. "
"6488160","6488780"," Thank you for playing."
"6489420","6491480"," You have to make a plan for what you're going to do at the end of the day."
"6493990","6495510"," Let me see if I got any value left in my. "
"6495890","6499250"," Yeah, so now my four seventies are worthless at this point."
"6499450","6500450"," I don't even think I can sell them now."
"6502070","6502850"," Let's see if they'll sell. "
"6504950","6506130"," Yeah, they're not even selling them."
"6506590","6509630"," So I'm going to see if I don't think they're I can even sell them now."
"6509790","6513450"," So I even lost even last thirteen cents on those calls. "
"6514910","6517150"," I had a thirteen cents and they were."
"6517270","6518330"," Oh, nope, they did sell."
"6518630","6521570"," So there is some still some hope that we hit for 70 today. "
"6525230","6526350"," But I don't think that they sell."
"6530150","6530790"," So we'll see."
"6530790","6534110"," We'll see if we can sell or salvage anything this morning. "
"6534110","6535830"," I did make some money on some puts though."
"6536070","6536970"," I did at the belly."
"6536970","6538870"," So after the belly yesterday, buy some puts. "
"6538910","6545230"," So I did save some money on on spy this morning on my losses on spy."
"6546390","6550450"," So we're really wasn't too bad of a loss overall on that trade."
"6550930","6555090"," And I'm going to take that trade again more than likely at the bell today on the spy. "
"6555470","6558930"," What I'll end up doing here is I'm going to end up taking."
"6559690","6562390"," More F D's on the spy."
"6562810","6566030"," Maybe even on IWM or QQ's this time. "
"6574110","6577090"," Yeah, I didn't end up holding him problem with Friday."
"6577210","6583190"," Normally, especially Friday specifically is if you don't get rid of your ship by like eleven thirty"
"6583190","6583630"," in the morning."
"6583990","6586150"," All the trading is done for the day typically. "
"6586390","6589310"," Sometimes we'll sell off or we'll go crazy high on a Friday."
"6590730","6592390"," But I'm going to be looking for some."
"6592990","6597830"," I don't want to wait for this grind of the puts and calls to be done on the spy. "
"6598030","6603490"," And then I'm going to take a position at some point either at the bell long or short."
"6608880","6610420"," Fridays typically trade is done."
"6616790","6621350"," It's all a bunch of people that blew up their accounts trying to save their accounts on Fridays. "
"6621850","6623630"," A bunch of retail traders that are trying to."
"6628310","6631890"," Trying to salvage something or whatever it is they try to do when they blow up their accounts."
"6636860","6637420"," Okay. "
"6649720","6650840"," January 18."
"6658220","6661240"," And spot camera did make one comment this morning."
"6661320","6666380"," I did read their AM report and they did say that we have. "
"6668000","6669540"," Let me see if I can bring it up."
"6676100","6679900"," I'm going to post this on I don't know if I'm going to post probably shouldn't."
"6683270","6684930"," So January 21. "
"6687310","6694750"," There is a large call gamma position rolling off on January 21."
"6697530","6698170"," Massive."
"6698370","6701350"," It's the largest one rolling off from now into April. "
"6702050","6705470"," Not that not that we won't get larger call positions into April."
"6706890","6712510"," But for right now we have a major call position rolling off on the 21st."
"6712850","6717590"," They are implying on spot gamma that it could be negative for the market. "
"6720590","6723370"," Let me see me receiving and read exactly what they said about this."
"6727040","6728560"," They say they've made these comments."
"6728820","6730520"," I don't think I've ever I've maybe I might have missed them. "
"6730560","6735440"," I don't read the I don't read the spot gamma report every day in the AM and PM."
"6735440","6739080"," They sometimes get a lot right and sometimes they don't or sometimes they're."
"6739660","6741840"," They're too too sided on their on their position. "
"6742000","6746440"," They'll give you the bare side and the bull side, but they're not definitive and what their take is"
"6746440","6746720"," on it."
"6747540","6748500"," When they don't know."
"6750380","6752580"," So let me read this off to you though this morning. "
"6753020","6753880"," They said this morning."
"6758250","6759570"," Yeah, so let me start with this."
"6759570","6764230"," They said in the last several sessions interest rate concerns ease which led to a quick rally and"
"6764230","6765230"," many of those oversold names. "
"6765230","6767850"," However, yesterday's fed rate comments by brainer."
"6767930","6770270"," Is it brainer?"
"6770330","6770750"," Lainie Bernard."
"6773320","6775900"," The tech and meme selling resumed in similar fashion. "
"6776980","6781040"," To early January tech selling, but little index hedging."
"6781420","6787720"," So when they said little index hedging, we did see those puts come in at yesterday at the bell, but"
"6787720","6789460"," they were quickly taken off this morning."
"6790460","6792840"," Should that index hedging demand increase?"
"6792840","6797700"," It would likely lead to a large spike in implied volatility and a large decline in markets. "
"6798260","6799280"," Now it is interesting."
"6799620","6803960"," I haven't seen yet today the major hedging that he's taught that they're talking about."
"6804540","6810740"," We'll look for that hedging today into the close and even into 4.15 pm to see if when those"
"6810740","6811940"," arrive if they arrive. "
"6812560","6820160"," My bigger concern this morning though is where the hedging is taking place today is not in tech or"
"6820160","6820740"," in."
"6821720","6826440"," Like, you know, like a speculative growth stocks, meme stocks, retail stocks."
"6826760","6830240"," The hedging that we're seeing today is where a lot of the bulls are hiding. "
"6830700","6833160"," I'm seeing it in tickers like Kroger, right?"
"6833340","6835320"," You don't want to see hedging in Kroger."
"6835640","6839100"," If you see it in Kroger, then you know that that is the implication."
"6839800","6845740"," That between now and March 18th, we're going to sell the market down and there's a lot of white and"
"6845740","6849960"," black papers out there that talk about how you have to trade volatility as a hedge. "
"6849960","6850840"," Excuse me."
"6851180","6856360"," If the long volatility instead of longing the traditional stocks that you can hide in like a"
"6856360","6858580"," Kroger, can't hide in a Kroger anymore."
"6859160","6863600"," Those days are over where you can hide in a Kroger if the market sells off completely. "
"6864760","6868820"," When you liquidate the market these days, it does liquidate everything."
"6869260","6871300"," And I believe in that take as well."
"6871860","6874440"," And so we are seeing those hedges come in this morning. "
"6875000","6879020"," So just be conscious of that as we trade the rest of the day away."
"6879020","6881180"," If some of you guys don't know it, take it off this morning."
"6882240","6889740"," But for some of you out there, I do want you to realize that there is hedging coming into the"
"6889740","6890000"," market. "
"6890000","6891920"," It's not where you'd expect it right now."
"6892820","6897140"," And when you do see that hedging coming into the market, people are placing bets that we do sell"
"6897140","6897880"," down, which we should."
"6898380","6899520"," Every year we sell down. "
"6899980","6902860"," There's not a year that we don't sell down in January to March."
"6903300","6905420"," It's typical, it's common, it's the norm."
"6905420","6908020"," So you're going to expect to see this hedging coming in. "
"6908260","6909380"," We are seeing it this morning."
"6911080","6912500"," So I'll continue on with what they said."
"6913040","6918540"," They said we've made, we've also made several comments in regards to January 21st, January Opex"
"6918540","6920620"," being of significant size. "
"6921200","6922460"," I don't remember those comments."
"6922660","6926380"," Maybe they were made, maybe they were made that they would raise the market up while they were"
"6926380","6926680"," important."
"6927520","6930260"," That we've seen, we've seen call hedging. "
"6930400","6932480"," That's why we're at 480 or whatever, or we're at 480."
"6932480","6937720"," This Opex is not a major index event, but holds very large, deep in the money."
"6938340","6941060"," Single stock positions, as shown in the chart below. "
"6941520","6946780"," We show something north of 125 billion in notional call delta is expiring."
"6947240","6952100"," Initially, we would assume that this would lead to single stocks coming for sale into and around"
"6952100","6953640"," 121 Opex."
"6954240","6958480"," For this reason, we've been watching for volatility into and around Opex. "
"6958480","6960100"," I think we've already talked about that."
"6960240","6963520"," We know that there's always volatility every month into Opex."
"6964160","6966080"," We expected every single month, right?"
"6966400","6971980"," We talked about how on the 10th and 12th of January that we should expect to trade down in the"
"6971980","6973980"," market leading into Opex. "
"6974940","6981120"," We know that typically we'll trade down deeply into the Thursday of Opex and spike crazy high on"
"6981120","6981540"," that Thursday."
"6982000","6985600"," We've talked about that on this channel every day ad nauseam for two weeks, right?"
"6985840","6987020"," Three weeks, I think we've talked about it."
"6987920","6991880"," But this time, I guess, we have, like, this time is different. "
"6992420","6998280"," You have a large call position, an unusually high call position, expiring this Opex."
"6999640","7003160"," They also go on to note that they'll provide a full analysis today."
"7003680","7006840"," But given the volatility, we're flagging this for you all day. "
"7007080","7007500"," All right, whatever."
"7007980","7009640"," Anyways, what does that mean?"
"7010340","7017620"," I don't know what that means, but maybe it means that we have a more amplified slowdown than we"
"7017620","7022560"," normally do at this month's Opex because of the $125 billion rolling off."
"7023360","7028740"," We talked earlier this week about where the call wall is, right?"
"7028880","7032380"," The absolute gamma on calls are we talked about?"
"7032720","7036320"," We talked about do we think it's going up to $500?"
"7036840","7037160"," No. "
"7037920","7040080"," Do we think it's going up to $480?"
"7040440","7040840"," Remember this conversation?"
"7041300","7042260"," Do we think it's going up to $480?"
"7044160","7048460"," If you think it's possible or going to $480, we won't actually trade there, right?"
"7048540","7053700"," We'll probably trade around $478, $475, and then lower, right?"
"7053820","7063060"," We also talked about if we're only going to trade to $480, or excuse me, $478, $475, $470, then you"
"7063060","7066580"," need the expansion on the downward side so you can get a better trading range, right?"
"7066580","7074840"," You have a trading range, you're at $500, then your expectations lowered to $480, then your"
"7074840","7075800"," expectations lowered."
"7076520","7082340"," Or you know that your real trading range is like $475, $478, so then you'll see the bulls start"
"7082340","7086760"," buying calls that are in the money instead of buying $480s and $500s."
"7087220","7093020"," Like if we're only going to $475, I'm going to buy $470s, and so now you've got this concentration"
"7093020","7095500"," at $470, right?"
"7095500","7102480"," You've got this huge call gamma rolling off into the 21st, and it'll be replaced with, instead of"
"7102480","7107700"," an expectation of $500, being left with an expectation of $470, right?"
"7108040","7112840"," And then you've got savvy put buyers coming in and call sellers coming in, and they're saying,"
"7113020","7123520"," well, I'm going to sell a shit ton of calls above $470, right?"
"7125680","7127440"," I don't know, $460, let's say. "
"7127680","7135560"," You'll start to see it move down from $500 to $460 to $480 and $450 or $440, and hopefully you"
"7135560","7138440"," get it down to, let's say, $460, right?"
"7138520","7139140"," It would be the next level."
"7139280","7145680"," You say, well, I don't know if we're going above $470 now, so I'll buy some $465 calls, I'll buy"
"7145680","7146660"," some $460 calls."
"7146660","7154100"," Your wall then becomes $470, and you've got more put buyers stepping in, trying to buy the $440s,"
"7154200","7155520"," $430s, $420s. "
"7155780","7161660"," You start to see that trading range start to trend down until bulls say to themselves, let's say"
"7161660","7163320"," now you're trading down to $440."
"7164640","7166360"," Let's say at $440, right?"
"7167220","7171660"," And your trading range, your implied trading range, right?"
"7173440","7179840"," You're down here at this $440 and $400, and you're looking for a moment where bulls say, oh, you"
"7179840","7180920"," know what, this looks cheap again."
"7181580","7187800"," We're at $400, our top is $440, but I'm going to buy some $450 and $470 and $480 calls. "
"7188520","7191840"," And that starts to raise that, raise that trading range up."
"7192000","7197740"," And until you see that, you're not going to see that our trading range hover higher, you're going"
"7197740","7204540"," to see it slowly come down until we hit a bottom of bull saying things are cheap again."
"7205480","7213000"," So from my perspective, I've got my eyes on all this dog shit, not dog shit, but all these trades"
"7213000","7214820"," that took place from March, 2020. "
"7215280","7219480"," You're looking at SKUs, you're looking at PayPal's, you're looking at, I've got a list of them,"
"7219560","7219580"," right?"
"7219760","7220780"," I can list them off to you."
"7220780","7222200"," I'm sure all of you know about these stocks."
"7224970","7231350"," You've got the P-tons, the DKNGs, the Rivians, the Fubos, the data dogs, the Affirms, Elsids,"
"7231650","7235410"," Shopify, Roblox, SC, Snap, Now, Bill. "
"7236050","7236870"," You guys know them, right?"
"7237070","7239070"," You guys know all these stocks."
"7239310","7240870"," I don't have to list them off to even hood."
"7241130","7246410"," Even surprisingly hood is one of those stocks where I want to see it at $13.60. I want to"
"7246410","7249210"," see SQ trade down to its bottom number. "
"7249210","7253850"," So I'm looking for those, so what am I looking for for the market to sell down to the point"
"7253850","7255990"," where as a bull, I can say I'm buying this."
"7256530","7263490"," I'm looking for those stocks to trade down to either their trend line, their base trend line to"
"7263490","7269810"," where it meets up today, where I'm looking for capitulation down to below or to tap where the 2020"
"7269810","7272970"," March trade was, because that's where the banks got in these trades."
"7274270","7278490"," I'm looking for the indexes to slowly sell down, right?"
"7278610","7282610"," I want to see the indexes come down to match up to the other stocks that have been sold down"
"7282610","7282950"," already. "
"7283450","7289370"," And then as a last part, I'm looking for all the cyclical stocks, all the stocks that every hides"
"7289370","7292090"," in to be shorted, right, actively."
"7292510","7295550"," And we just, we're seeing those today to March 18th."
"7296390","7300770"," And so you're looking for all these parts to start to match up so that we can take a position,"
"7300910","7301930"," an actual long position. "
"7303110","7308930"," Now, with all that being said, that doesn't mean that you're, if you're a bull that you say, oh, I"
"7308930","7309690"," don't buy anything."
"7310290","7315370"," It means that you have to know where the trading range is, the implied range, where the column put"
"7315370","7315850"," walls are."
"7316490","7318270"," You buy those bottoms and trade them up. "
"7318590","7320270"," You sell the rips and trade it down."
"7320810","7326890"," And you trade this entire zone down until we find a place where bulls and banks say, okay, we're"
"7326890","7329870"," ready to put some dry powder into the market."
"7329870","7332670"," Even myself, I don't own any stock out there. "
"7332990","7335810"," I sold my, all my stock positions were sold by September."
"7336550","7342270"," I even mentioned and commented that Apple would probably go to all-time crazy new highs, 190, way"
"7342270","7343350"," back in September on video."
"7344270","7345410"," And of course it did. "
"7346290","7351750"," But, you know, I guess the question it is is, or the question is, do we sell straight down from"
"7351750","7353290"," now into March 18th?"
"7353670","7356070"," And you can't just, I don't trade that."
"7356070","7362230"," I don't trade, I prefer to trade sell the rip and buy the dip all the way down into the"
"7362230","7362450"," end."
"7362890","7369230"," And if we have any crazy capitulation moves, usually the best trades are on the call side because"
"7369230","7371490"," the puts are one for one generally. "
"7371950","7378990"," They do print sometimes 500%, 1000, 3000%, but they tend not to print like a call prints."
"7380030","7382050"," So I still hang on the call side of things."
"7382550","7383650"," I'm still a bull in this market. "
"7383650","7389510"," And the only thing that I haven't done yet that I'm kind of pissed off at is I haven't bought"
"7389510","7390350"," my market hedge."
"7391430","7392870"," I meant to buy it."
"7393030","7395250"," We didn't get as how we got real close. "
"7395870","7398630"," And I might be missing my chance now to buy my market hedge."
"7398990","7400670"," I should have bought it yesterday at 472."
"7400850","7405790"," I was hoping that we would trade up to like 475, 478, so I could grab that hedge. "
"7406390","7410550"," But I'm expecting at this point, I'm going to look for one more rip in the market."
"7411250","7416150"," If we can get one more rip in the market, I'll put that hedge on it's hedge includes like a"
"7416150","7416910"," strike."
"7417190","7419390"," It's a put back spread. "
"7419830","7425470"," It's when you're selling, you're selling to some two puts and then you're inside the money and then"
"7425470","7427690"," you're buying away outside the money put."
"7428330","7429290"," And I'm buying the mat."
"7430610","7435170"," 406, I think, 352 something like 250 and 150. "
"7436530","7438910"," And I'll roll those every three months for the next year."
"7439670","7444130"," And that deals with the bear side of things, the market doom bears."
"7444610","7448670"," And I'll just trade the market up and down as we head down into end of March. "
"7449330","7455130"," And then I'm looking for that defined bottom that I expect for the market to take longs into the"
"7455130","7455690"," end of the year."
"7458610","7459670"," So that's where we are today."
"7460490","7465370"," All we're going to be doing today is watching for market hedges being put on where they're being"
"7465370","7465910"," put on. "
"7466410","7469210"," And then we're going to look to take a position to Tuesday."
"7481940","7485420"," Pod POD has calls coming in."
"7487220","7493780"," April 14th 50c one or 14.2 million dollars. "

"7523260","7524530"," PDD got that wrong. "
"7525030","7526730"," PDD I'm old."
"7527410","7528210"," I can't see shit."
"7529370","7538470"," PDD so it's in duo duo Inc American depository shares. "
"7541450","7549950"," PDD 14.2 million dollar call 50c for April 14th."
"7551840","7561200"," And they're selling off currently too."
"7565090","7567270"," Ooh interesting trade. "
"7569110","7576710"," So pin duo was a trade that started on March 18th 2020 shocker."
"7577190","7580610"," It was at 36 dollars and 23 cents."
"7581550","7585650"," It traded all the way up to two hundred and twelve dollars. "
"7587870","7593850"," Trade it all the way up to two hundred and twelve dollars on February 10th of 2021."
"7594970","7600510"," I bet in March I bet in December that CNBC said this is the future PDD."
"7601390","7604490"," And then then began to sell it down for an entire year. "
"7605030","7607750"," So it did just bounce at 47 28."
"7610700","7612240"," And it bounced on."
"7614780","7617820"," January looks like January 5th or something. "
"7618020","7619320"," It bounced."
"7621820","7623060"," Let's see here."
"7623920","7629780"," And it bounced here on January 5th at 47 11. "
"7631040","7633100"," It's selling down today currently."
"7633560","7637060"," But that's a pretty large call position."
"7638240","7639600"," 15 million in calls. "
"7640460","7647340"," Looks like somebody wants to save it from the typical sell down."
"7647520","7648020"," I don't know why."
"7648360","7649320"," Maybe somebody knows why. "
"7651760","7654660"," Look at these calls and why they put why they place this bet."
"7655440","7661700"," I'm assuming this is a cheap way to buy shares that this that this trade is not really intended."
"7665390","7667370"," Not really intended to make money. "
"7667550","7668770"," It's more to buy cheap shares."
"7669890","7674730"," So PDD April 14th."
"7675890","7677650"," The calls weren't cheap either. "
"7677870","7683110"," They were $14.20 for 10,000 shares."
"7684810","7688550"," I'm assuming that this is going to be they're going to let these."
"7689630","7691610"," They're going to execute these. "
"7693810","7694930"," When it comes time."
"7695210","7696730"," So they're buying them at the 50 strike."
"7697850","7701310"," So they're able to buy a stock for cheap. "
"7701750","7702630"," If it goes up."
"7705400","7706820"," Yeah, 10,000 calls."
"7707440","7710720"," They're at $13.60 is the ask right now. "
"7710960","7712160"," Where do they buy these for?"
"7713160","7714140"," I like this trade too."
"7715880","7723340"," They bought them for $14.20. 14 million."
"7724240","7725420"," 14.2 million. "
"7725740","7726320"," So PDD."
"7735920","7737200"," We'll track this one."
"7739760","7741120"," I'm interested in this trade. "
"7742700","7743900"," I'm going to set alert on this one."
"7745260","7750010"," I wonder if there's some news on PDD."
"7759570","7761750"," Maybe this is a buyback for the company. "
"7771880","7773700"," Let me see you guys are texting right there."
"7773780","7774840"," I missed a bunch of what you guys are saying."
"7777240","7779400"," Okay, so Munger and Dalio are in. "
"7779660","7781140"," Someone knows something with Chinese government."
"7781400","7783740"," Paul, make a scroll back up missing all everything you guys are texting."
"7784840","7788120"," Let me start at the top here. "
"7788920","7790600"," I have 449 expiring today."
"7791360","7793120"," What's that what that likely means?"
"7793520","7794040"," Do we just reverse?"
"7794280","7795160"," Are we still selling rip?"
"7796060","7796900"," Test the catching a bid."
"7797220","7798260"," I'll bring up test for you guys. "
"7802490","7803010"," Unsubscribe."
"7804630","7805490"," Bring up Tesla."
"7808010","7809030"," No, I think it's more. "
"7809330","7811410"," I mean, you figure they have to burn all the calls down, right?"
"7811730","7812930"," And then they have to burn all the puts."
"7814390","7817230"," Sometimes they'll keep printing puts on a Friday."
"7818050","7823170"," But typically what they'll do is they'll burn both sides of the market. "
"7823790","7828930"," They'll print the spreads into the clothes and we're done for the week."
"7830490","7836110"," Other than that, it becomes panic from retail traders that need to make money or something."
"7837730","7839450"," So we'll bring up Tesla for you guys. "
"7840010","7840830"," Let that load up."
"7842430","7842870"," UVXY."
"7843270","7844430"," I'll bring up UVXY for you. "
"7844630","7845570"," Oh, here we go."
"7845750","7846730"," I got one of those bots."
"7849390","7849970"," Excuse me. "
"7850990","7853430"," I got to report a bot for child abuse."
"7862250","7863710"," What am I doing here?"
"7866650","7870050"," Where are the comments section to kill the spot?"
"7872930","7874790"," I found where those Russian was."
"7876110","7877970"," Got dang Russian bots. "
"7878930","7880250"," I got to find out how to fight these things."
"7881270","7887990"," I started searching for it yesterday and I ended up going back down the rabbit hole."
"7888170","7890050"," Somehow I'm missing that Russian bot in here. "
"7891570","7892530"," I missed him."
"7895250","7896430"," Where's that Russian bot?"
"7899750","7901030"," I missed him."
"7901590","7905930"," I'm going to try to do it on OBS, see if I can get this Russian bot in OBS. "
"7906990","7907470"," Nope."
"7908470","7910130"," I'll keep my eyes out for Russian bots."
"7911510","7911810"," Yep. "
"7912190","7912510"," Pinned out."
"7912750","7913090"," Chinese."
"7914490","7915370"," Oh, is it Chinese?"
"7917070","7918950"," If it's Chinese, then fuck that trade. "
"7920390","7922010"," I'm not down with any Chinese trades."
"7923030","7924170"," They just pump money."
"7925650","7926950"," My answer is hell no. "
"7927150","7929370"," Do not trade PDD if it's Chinese bank."
"7930350","7932830"," I'm not down with trading Chinese stocks personally."
"7933890","7935150"," I've been burned too many times. "
"7941410","7942710"," That's a good point right here, right?"
"7943250","7946730"," So someone's saying, yes, they don't see it as insider trading."
"7947850","7948830"," Matt's making a good point."
"7948830","7952750"," I don't know about the reason for the calls on PDD, but China's different insider trading laws. "
"7953250","7956770"," The person giving the information gets in trouble, not the people who trade profit from it."
"7956910","7957670"," That makes sense too."
"7958430","7960090"," I used to live in Asia. "
"7961370","7964710"," So there's this whole thing where they like to copy shit."
"7964910","7968150"," It's looked positively upon to copy things."
"7969350","7970690"," This falls in line with that. "
"7970870","7973970"," It also falls in line with how the markets and trade in China as well."
"7974760","7979950"," You basically have like two sessions in the Asian markets."
"7981720","7983390"," Nice little spy bounce. "
"7986600","7988560"," Expected to emerge from reeducation also."
"7988760","7989800"," Really adding zalas for CCP."
"7993180","7993760"," BBIG. "
"7994030","7995580"," I'll look BBIG up for you too."
"7995900","7996880"," You guys want to see BBIG?"
"7997300","7999560"," I haven't done these stocks at all."
"8000740","8002380"," I haven't done BBIG in a long time. "
"8003480","8005080"," So we'll subscribe to that one real quick."
"8006140","8007480"," DBS Bank got an upgrade."
"8010850","8013610"," A robot and YouTube comments here. "
"8015110","8015550"," Botsky."
"8015970","8018530"," Yeah, I brought my chat on YouTube."
"8018910","8020990"," I couldn't scroll deep enough back to find him. "
"8022470","8023430"," China number one."
"8023430","8023930"," Yeah, exactly."
"8024230","8024590"," Oh, he's back. "
"8024690","8025330"," Is he back again?"
"8026150","8026210"," No."
"8028420","8030540"," Yeah, I tried to scroll back to find that Chinese bot."
"8031140","8034220"," I'm going to have to find a program to fight the bots. "
"8034220","8036000"," Maybe I just got another one."
"8038180","8039300"," I'll check Microsoft next."
"8040180","8041040"," What's the backstory?"
"8042600","8043740"," What's the backstory?"
"8044540","8049400"," Hop in more words to hop into foreign. "
"8050400","8054660"," If you can give me more words for your question."
"8056900","8063630"," Give me the default view."
"8064630","8067250"," That Russian bot just come back in here again. "
"8067250","8075620"," Son of a bitch."
"8075620","8076400"," There he is."
"8076520","8077420"," The little fucker. "
"8078200","8078780"," All right."
"8079220","8081000"," What am I reporting you for today?"
"8081820","8083500"," Unwanted commercial content or spam."
"8083840","8084400"," Nah, too easy. "
"8084860","8086680"," Pornography and sexually explicit material."
"8087260","8088300"," Nah, not quite."
"8088900","8089200"," Child abuse. "
"8089440","8090020"," We did that one yesterday."
"8091180","8093080"," Hate speech or graphic violence."
"8093420","8093820"," That's a good one. "
"8094440","8095220"," Harassment or bullying."
"8096640","8098620"," We'll go with child abuse again."
"8098860","8099220"," There you go. "
"8099880","8101300"," We'll report you for child abuse."
"8102460","8103520"," That's a nasty one."
"8105640","8106440"," See you later. "
"8107200","8108360"," Bye bye Russian bots."
"8110620","8112980"," Yeah, China's equity market is a giant pump and dump."
"8113180","8115480"," And the patch will look exit scam for copy company founders. "
"8115940","8116720"," 100% agree."
"8117720","8119500"," Yeah, the Russian bots are funny."
"8120980","8122200"," It's tough trading China. "
"8122460","8122680"," It's weird."
"8122900","8129180"," You know the problem with at least in the US markets, the problem for me is that if you see"
"8129180","8129900"," flow come in."
"8129900","8133480"," If you see somebody buy a $50 million in Apple. "
"8134560","8135600"," Apple calls today."
"8135980","8136640"," Apple's going up."
"8138910","8139490"," No matter what. "
"8139750","8140990"," You see $50 million in outputs."
"8141390","8141910"," Outputs go."
"8142030","8142650"," Apple's going down. "
"8143570","8148770"," But you see like $50 million come into a K web on like a Friday when it's burning."
"8149710","8152750"," My only thought right there is God dammit."
"8152850","8156150"," I'm like some official in China is propping up K web right now. "
"8156610","8158030"," Just so it doesn't crash and burn."
"8158450","8159730"," But this is not real money."
"8159730","8163130"," It's just like funny money to prop up K web right now. "
"8163270","8166410"," So you can't really trade that $50 million trade in K web."
"8166830","8172230"," You just can't trade China stocks or specifically China ETFs."
"8172290","8174570"," You can't trade them with the with the thought. "
"8174810","8176530"," Oh, you can trade China stocks."
"8176550","8182110"," I'm saying you can't trade some of this money that flow that comes in and say, yeah, look, I can"
"8182110","8187810"," directly correlate $50 million in the stock coming in at this moment because it's going up."
"8189230","8190650"," You reported them to Brad. "
"8190970","8198400"," And I've got I've got some friends and I've got some discord friends that trade China."
"8198740","8201100"," They actually trade that in that the Hong Kong market."
"8201620","8203139"," And they love it. "
"8203340","8206200"," They love trading it and they love actually trading that market."
"8206559","8208940"," And then the role into the US markets."
"8212200","8215639"," Paul is out half of his embassy Emma MES long at VPOC. "
"8218719","8221280"," Yeah, Tesla's that Tesla's running right now."
"8221520","8223540"," You've got some minor resistance above it."
"8224440","8225120"," On Tesla. "
"8226440","8227680"," I'm looking right now."
"8227799","8229240"," I want to see that."
"8229340","8231100"," Did that Uber trade take off this morning?"
"8231440","8233780"," There are some Tesla calls on on board right now. "
"8234120","8237520"," You've got retail traders trading it for 10.55 across the board."
"8238240","8240340"," Lots of interest at 10.55 on Tesla."
"8243500","8246240"," Looks like the day trade day traders are trying to get us up here. "
"8246600","8248540"," They can see us going to 10.50 right now."
"8249820","8254440"," So day we day trader knows all the levels he's going to 10.50. They got it."
"8254580","8255580"," You guys got to take. "
"8255740","8259840"," If you guys are day to day trading like this, you guys got to make the calls like 10.70."
"8260660","8262580"," I thought that was like old school day trader stuff."
"8262780","8265459"," Like slightly outside of the money from where you want it to be."
"8266040","8267820"," Because it's never actually going there. "
"8268520","8270139"," You just want on the print just enough."
"8270740","8272680"," I always hear that too from trader or from investors."
"8273040","8275180"," They're like, well, you didn't get your print. "
"8275240","8278600"," You didn't actually hit 10.70. And I'm like, we never wanted it to."
"8278940","8283000"," We just wanted to get to 10.50. Because that prints 200%."
"8283719","8288760"," We don't really care if it gets 10.70. We just want to make sure it gets to a distinct"
"8288760","8290100"," area. "
"8290959","8296180"," So if you're day trading this, I'll give you an exact mark here close overnight."
"8296440","8297740"," There's a little bit of ice above here."
"8298480","8303260"," There should be a little bit of resistance here at 10.44.74. And you are looking for 10.49 "
"8303260","8307680",".58. It has a target. "
"8309700","8310860"," Look at BBIG."
"8311500","8313400"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"8313840","8315459"," Hero indicator and a $3 stock. "
"8316760","8320260"," And it's going to pimp out the Wall Street betters in the hair."
"8322280","8329700"," We've got $3.95. Currently sitting at $3.95. We look like we're at localized support on BBIG."
"8331200","8335540"," $3.41 is the big buy on BBIG. "
"8335540","8345440"," Our price targets above are $4.44. $4.45. $6."
"8347200","8348540"," I got you, bros."
"8348660","8348980"," Don't worry. "
"8351340","8359299"," And if you are a super duper big baller on Wall Street bets, you're going to be telling everybody"
"8359299","8366740"," that we're definitely going to $7.86 with a potential of $9.72. And if we're going to get crazy"
"8366740","8367540"," out there, right?"
"8370760","8380709"," If you want to start your own subreddit, forget $9.80. We're looking for $12, $15,"
"8381510","8382610"," and $20."
"8382850","8384830"," We want 400% on BBIG."
"8385910","8387330"," Big monies above $20. "
"8393270","8394430"," Tick high of day."
"8394750","8395470"," So we'll check out tick."
"8402060","8402880"," Yeah, I've traded big. "
"8403360","8405200"," BBIG, I traded back in the day, too."
"8405600","8410920"," When I was trading all these stocks, it was a very good ticker."
"8411020","8411720"," I'm not going to say it. "
"8411780","8414280"," You could sell puts on BBIG right now, actually."
"8414680","8417700"," If you sell puts right now on BBIG, you'd probably make some change."
"8417960","8419600"," Probably make some definite money. "
"8421020","8422060"," Some change in the pocket."
"8426910","8427290"," Oh, wait a minute."
"8428130","8428750"," Tick high of day. "
"8428970","8430910"," You must be talking about something else."
"8431430","8434410"," Made back on NIO and XPevo and touch again."
"8439500","8442080"," What I'm hearing is that my week's profit into it. "
"8442360","8444420"," Yeah, actually, be honest with you."
"8444520","8445940"," We were just looking at the BBIG chart."
"8446140","8451340"," You could probably sell some, like, $2 puts, $3 puts, and make some serious money. "
"8452180","8454380"," I shouldn't say that, but it looks true."
"8457440","8458640"," It looks true in that chart."
"8461560","8462680"," You got Joe Harper in here. "
"8462720","8464580"," He's got a little bit of hope for Spy today."
"8465260","8466820"," Joe Harper is diamond-handed."
"8466820","8470360"," I did sell my 470Cs for, like, a penny. "
"8470940","8475000"," And the fact that they executed means that the market still believes that that's going up."
"8475940","8481460"," Because when they don't execute, they're telling you in the background, sorry, buddy."
"8481980","8482440"," You're screwed. "
"8486180","8488180"," I probably should have held those a little bit longer."
"8489060","8493400"," They're now up to $0.04. So I sold at a loss of $1 penny."
"8493420","8497380"," I should have held them to $0.04. Those 470Ps. "
"8498020","8503480"," I should have sold those at $0.13. But it doesn't matter."
"8503740","8503940"," It's a loss."
"8505100","8508300"," I'll take the L and move on. "
"8509780","8511200"," Take the L and move on."
"8511420","8517900"," Actually, it's funny, those 470Cs went from one penny to $0.04. So they went up 400%."
"8517900","8519180"," The moment I sold. "
"8520280","8522220"," The market makers are probably like, fuck them."
"8522240","8522560"," He's gone."
"8522560","8524780"," We can now raise the price up again. "
"8528320","8530220"," The weight is out of the market."
"8533060","8534800"," That fucking asshole bull."
"8535400","8536280"," Fuck that guy. "
"8545710","8546930"," Oh, Randall's still."
"8547430","8548770"," Randall's still diamond-handed."
"8551040","8555100"," Oh, Kirk's saying Cap just got back from my job interview at Burger King. "
"8555580","8557180"," My 475 calls for 121."
"8557880","8558280"," For 121."
"8558380","8559340"," Can they recover?"
"8560180","8560960"," I don't know. "
"8560960","8561880"," I think so."
"8564880","8566940"," Dude, seriously with the Russian fucking bots."
"8567160","8568140"," What's up, motherfucker?"
"8570550","8572030"," I'm going to find out how to get rid of the Russian bots. "
"8575280","8577480"," Anybody know a way to get rid of the Russian bots?"
"8582810","8584510"," Remove, put this user in timeout."
"8585330","8586270"," Maybe it's just better to remove."
"8586650","8586910"," I don't know. "
"8587450","8588830"," Hide this user on this channel."
"8588950","8589470"," That might work better."
"8592810","8594790"," This user's messages will be hidden. "
"8595390","8596430"," That might work better than reporting."
"8597410","8599310"," You know that YouTube sucks at this."
"8602640","8604300"," So that's a Russian bot. "
"8606940","8608180"," Cowboy here with a new baby."
"8609600","8612180"," You sold yesterday for $0.95. Yeah, I sold calls."
"8612620","8614600"," I sold calls at the open yesterday. "
"8615060","8616080"," Right at the open."
"8616860","8617480"," Made bank."
"8618000","8618940"," Bought puts yesterday. "
"8619340","8619800"," Made bank."
"8620580","8621920"," Well, that bank made good money."
"8623840","8625260"," I should have held those puts. "
"8625720","8627640"," If I had held, because I bought those puts at what?"
"8627880","8630480"," $0.38 or $0.56 or something stupid like that."
"8630480","8633020"," And I held them to the first rip."
"8633380","8634500"," We sold back down. "
"8634640","8636520"," I was off through and discord shit."
"8637060","8639380"," And then I sold out of those puts."
"8640200","8643000"," I think we've rode up a little bit more and then sold off into the clothes. "
"8643380","8646460"," I bought two racks of calls yesterday."
"8646700","8648100"," Both FDs expiring today."
"8649040","8649920"," First set burned. "
"8650600","8651280"," Second set burned."
"8651560","8656300"," And I could have saved the second set this morning from the winds, from the spy."
"8656300","8659880"," I bought after the belly yesterday. "
"8660560","8661920"," But I just let those burn this morning."
"8662400","8663120"," I'm fine with that."
"8663580","8664520"," Clean up my trades. "
"8664640","8665780"," My trades are all cleaned up now."
"8666300","8670080"," I've got four 75 C's that are worthless."
"8670480","8671000"," Just sitting here. "
"8671060","8671900"," I can't even execute them."
"8676300","8677280"," Not a Russian bot."
"8677560","8678720"," Jess is saying not a Russian bot. "
"8679360","8679860"," Hello comrade."
"8681500","8682320"," Yeah, we're trading."
"8685460","8690960"," Yeah, I asked Quinn about some stuff about a bunch of questions for Quinn. "
"8690960","8692460"," He said they would try to help me out."
"8694550","8696830"," Yeah, you're not seeing the bots because I'm deleting them."
"8703550","8707090"," Yeah, as Lou is saying, it only says psychobly or something. "
"8709070","8714530"," I asked that guy yesterday if he could say something that I could interpret."
"8716270","8718550"," And I didn't get a response from him."
"8719750","8725930"," Let's see if they're with the Russian to English. "
"8727590","8728570"," See what he said."
"8729310","8730510"," Maybe he's saying something."
"8731910","8736290"," Oh, it translates to bitch fucking. "
"8738030","8739050"," Bitch fucking."
"8740290","8741790"," So this is these are the Russians."
"8742090","8747470"," So if you are Russian and you're still listening into this podcast from Russia right now. "
"8748970","8753870"," If you're Russian and you're listening into this podcast right now, I want you to know that I'm a."
"8754130","8754530"," Oh, you."
"8754730","8755170"," Yep."
"8755730","8760450"," So if there are Russians that can understand English listening into this podcast right now from"
"8760450","8763070"," Mother Russia, from Ruski, right?"
"8763430","8763870"," Ruski. "
"8764370","8769270"," If you're one of those guys out there and you're listening right now and you only speak Russian and"
"8769270","8774650"," you're trying to spam this feed, I want you to know that I was a United States soldier."
"8777410","8779910"," And for 12 years of all things, right?"
"8779910","8786310"," And I just had a buddy of mine tell me a story recently about how you met up with some"
"8786310","8787770"," U.S. soldiers in Syria."
"8788570","8790430"," I was at two tanker units, right?"
"8790550","8792050"," U.S. and Russian soldiers met up. "
"8792450","8794970"," And I heard that there was a large fistfight."
"8795270","8796670"," It really wasn't reported in the U.S. news."
"8797250","8798950"," And I want you to know if you understand English, right?"
"8799350","8801050"," That I heard we kicked your fucking teeth in. "
"8801830","8805370"," And I wish I was there to kick your teeth in."
"8807810","8809930"," Oh, Psycho Blat is a gamer meme."
"8811410","8816730"," Sporky's like, Sporky's like, I got all the, Sporky's like, you fucking boomer. "
"8818210","8819730"," It's a gamer meme cocksucker."
"8821250","8822530"," Good job, Sporkay."
"8822970","8823930"," Keep us in the loop, brother. "
"8826690","8827790"," He knew something."
"8830870","8836290"," Yeah, he had like a, he had like a, Yeah, Russian chicks are hot, right?"
"8836650","8838230"," Yeah, like Russian chicks are super hot."
"8840730","8842490"," But again, that was a true story. "
"8843070","8846610"," There was a big ass fight amongst a bunch of American and Russian soldiers."
"8847130","8849970"," Russian soldiers didn't feel, didn't, didn't do so well."
"8850730","8851950"," It didn't fare well in that fight. "
"8853030","8855430"," I wonder if I can find that fight and post it somewhere."
"8856150","8859370"," I think it was talked about in a couple of newspapers."
"8860110","8864850"," It was like 30 guys involved, like 30 against 30. "
"8866590","8868750"," Oh, hey, Robert, thanks for the tip, brother."
"8872470","8874970"," Robert L, thank you for tipping this morning."
"8875450","8876270"," I appreciate it. "
"8876710","8878230"," Julian, thanks for subscribing."
"8878550","8879710"," Protrader, thanks for subscribing."
"8880610","8881590"," Betty Mac, thanks for the tip. "
"8882490","8883230"," Brad, thanks for the tip."
"8883870","8885770"," I want you to, let's take up, just take a moment right here."
"8885930","8887370"," If you could please support the channel. "
"8887630","8891750"," If you're a new trader, if you're an old, or if you're a new trader, a trader that's always losing,"
"8892350","8898470"," hopefully you can come and listen to these live streams so that you're not blowing up your"
"8898470","8903990"," accounts, so that you're learning how to put on the right kind of risk, and that you're making"
"8903990","8905230"," money in your trades mostly."
"8907910","8909950"," I'm doing these live streams every day."
"8910890","8914950"," I think I started with a half hour recorded video. "
"8915650","8917110"," I used to just type this stuff out on Twitter."
"8917110","8918270"," I guess it was started there."
"8918610","8923870"," I moved into some videos, and then it morphed into a live stream that I thought would be an hour"
"8923870","8927590"," a day, and now it's morphed into kind of a show, right?"
"8928290","8930930"," That'll last all day long, or has been lasting all day long. "
"8931350","8934130"," It's very expensive to produce this content."
"8934830","8940170"," I'm spending a lot of time outside of normal market hours trying to get some better stuff for you"
"8940170","8940330"," guys."
"8940670","8941830"," We have a website coming out. "
"8942170","8943650"," I've been recording training classes."
"8944690","8947430"," We've got a Discord that's being launched right now."
"8947550","8948150"," We're just working. "
"8948510","8950650"," Actually, Jodota was in it last night."
"8951090","8954910"," We're going to look at the website together and the Discord today together."
"8955710","8957990"," You'll start to get all your ER stuff. "
"8958130","8959090"," You'll get your levels every day."
"8959190","8960730"," Matter of fact, you didn't get your levels from me this morning."
"8961330","8962490"," I didn't have the time to get to that. "
"8963150","8964470"," But you get in this live stream every day."
"8964910","8969590"," If you're making money, if you're becoming a better trader, if you're getting out of actionable"
"8969590","8974910"," market information that you're not finding in other places on social media, that's why we started"
"8974910","8976930"," this channel was twofold."
"8977330","8980410"," One, because most private subs are very expensive. "
"8982310","8984130"," They cost a lot of money."
"8984390","8987850"," You typically don't get actionable information in those subs."
"8988370","8989790"," I've been a member of those subs. "
"8990070","8991350"," I've paid for classes myself."
"8991950","8994930"," I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars doing this stuff."
"8997210","9000470"," It's rarely that I've found great subscriptions out there. "
"9000710","9005330"," It doesn't matter if it's a class or a room or usually the rooms where people are assholes."
"9005810","9007030"," We're not assholes around here."
"9007670","9012910"," Sometimes the flow services, someone was just commenting on how difficult it is to trade against"
"9012910","9014090"," another flow service. "
"9014610","9015690"," I've paid for all of them."
"9015930","9017590"," I know which ones are great, which ones suck."
"9018750","9019790"," Same thing with the sub. "
"9020010","9020570"," It's a free sub."
"9021390","9025870"," Hopefully we can provide the same or a higher level of content that most subs are providing out"
"9025870","9026050"," there."
"9026310","9026970"," It's all free. "
"9027510","9032350"," We ask that if you aren't making money from the sub to please tip what you can."
"9033410","9036350"," If you feel like you want a tip, if you can't, if you're poor, don't bother."
"9036710","9042310"," Just like and subscribe and stick around so we can continue to bring you great content. "
"9044170","9048650"," As time moves forward, the subs only have been going on in this form for like two or three weeks."
"9048650","9051890"," I think it's been growing really fast."
"9052570","9055450"," I really appreciate the support that you're all showing out there. "
"9056730","9060870"," I've got a list of people that have donated on PayPal and not on YouTube."
"9061290","9063270"," There's a little donation button in the description of YouTube."
"9063950","9067250"," I have a pinned donation button on the Twitter handle. "
"9067350","9068430"," It's at Captain's Alpha."
"9068910","9073070"," If you're not a member of that Captain's Alpha, please follow over there."
"9073950","9078470"," I'm trying to keep the bots out of that Twitter handle right now. "
"9078910","9082130"," I just want to say thanks for showing up every day."
"9082510","9083270"," It means more than anything."
"9083570","9087350"," Seeing all you guys here listening in every morning, it really does mean a lot to me. "
"9087570","9088730"," It blows me away."
"9088970","9089470"," It really does."
"9089910","9093670"," I'm probably going to mute the channel at some point in the next few minutes because I'm going to"
"9093670","9098390"," print off a sheet for people that I know that some people donate on PayPal and not on YouTube. "
"9098910","9102310"," I can't see your name unless I pull that sheet down and list you guys off."
"9102310","9104090"," We're going to crack a bear today."
"9104470","9105110"," You know what I'll do?"
"9105330","9107270"," I'm going to do a shot of whiskey with you guys today. "
"9107730","9108950"," I'm going to go pour a shot of whiskey."
"9109970","9115770"," That's $11.59. I'm going to mute just the volume here and the video of my face."
"9116830","9120770"," I'll leave the screener up for Tesla and Spy. "
"9121870","9123150"," I'll come back with..."
"9123150","9124490"," We'll have a whiskey in the afternoon."
"9124970","9125970"," It's up on Friday, right?"
"9127510","9130370"," I'll leave up the Spy for right now."
"9131430","9132430"," Let's do a shot of whiskey. "
"9134070","9135190"," It was a great trading week."
"9135390","9135830"," We made money."
"9136010","9136650"," We lost some money. "
"9136790","9137390"," I made more money."
"9137530","9138990"," I made way more money this week than I lost."
"9139450","9141670"," Like, ridiculous more money than I lost this week. "
"9141930","9143550"," I'll keep buying these dips."
"9146430","9146910"," But let's take..."
"9146910","9148090"," Let's have a shot of whiskey today."
"9149290","9152770"," I'm going to print out a list of anyone that donated on PayPal this week. "
"9153490","9155570"," I give all of you guys a shout out for this week as well."
"9158030","9158750"," You guys..."
"9158750","9159730"," Well, talk about some other stuff."
"9159730","9160470"," Do you guys want merch?"
"9160710","9162210"," I don't know if you like merch or not. "
"9162710","9164870"," Someone was saying I should have some merch."
"9164990","9166290"," I don't like merch, personally."
"9168830","9172370"," If you guys do, I have some funny..."
"9172370","9174630"," I was a Wall Street member for 10 years. "
"9176130","9178430"," Some of that merch I see out there on Twitter and shit."
"9178630","9179090"," That shit sucks."
"9179450","9184390"," No offense to anybody, but there's some way better sayings out there than people put on T-shirts"
"9184390","9184830"," and hats. "
"9185650","9187830"," And some of them you wouldn't even know unless you were a trader."
"9187830","9189990"," So, like, they'd be like undercover kind of stuff."
"9190470","9192090"," You could put it on a PADR T-shirt. "
"9192430","9194810"," And no one would notice unless they were an actual trader."
"9195590","9198350"," It wouldn't be vulgar, but it would be vulgar."
"9198630","9199670"," You know, it's like vulgar, but not vulgar. "
"9200850","9204930"," Or it's a slight towards bag holders or, you know, anybody."
"9205810","9208250"," It would be something that only a trader would know."
"9208810","9209710"," Only an investor would know. "
"9210410","9212170"," But I don't know if you guys want that stuff."
"9212430","9212950"," I'm not..."
"9212950","9215870"," I wasn't really interested in making that stuff, but let me know."
"9215870","9219050"," If you like, hey, I would prefer to have something for money or whatever. "
"9219570","9220110"," Let me know."
"9223490","9224430"," Yeah, I'll get a..."
"9224430","9225390"," Yeah, I like that idea."
"9225630","9226510"," The Coosie T-Chrone. "
"9226930","9228030"," I like the Coosie, brother."
"9230820","9231700"," I like the Coosie."
"9231900","9232820"," You know what I didn't even think of that. "
"9236430","9237150"," I can't..."
"9237150","9238030"," Yeah, tell a story."
"9238190","9239530"," Yeah, I'll tell a story about the Captain Jim logo."
"9241810","9243290"," Yeah, we could do some of what FDs. "
"9243630","9244390"," I got some funnier ones."
"9244910","9245530"," I got a whole list."
"9246370","9247830"," I've kept a bunch over the years. "
"9248270","9250290"," I have a bunch of notepads that I save."
"9251130","9252570"," You know, like there's some..."
"9253310","9257510"," Yeah, I've got all the jokes about way back in the day."
"9257630","9258450"," I've got all the nickel jokes. "
"9258610","9259830"," I've got all the gym grammar jokes."
"9261790","9262930"," Yeah, I'll check out INTC."
"9264090","9265790"," I'll check out INTC for you, brother. "
"9267890","9268610"," No worries."
"9269750","9270910"," If you like, subscribe."
"9271850","9273390"," Please support the channel if you can. "
"9274010","9276770"," It does take a lot of time for me to get this stuff out to you guys."
"9277250","9279030"," It's gonna get more streamlined over time."
"9279170","9279910"," I believe that it will. "
"9280130","9283210"," The more that I roll this stuff out, it's gonna get easier to do."
"9283370","9286810"," But for right now, it's not taking a lot of work to put this stuff out there."
"9287070","9288990"," It costs a lot of money to produce this information. "
"9291580","9292940"," I have to write all that down someday."
"9292940","9295480"," I have to figure out right now how much is costing, because it's expensive."
"9298040","9300540"," But it's not something that I'm concerned about right now. "
"9301820","9303840"," All right, so INTC, right?"
"9304580","9306000"," We've got more buyers than sellers."
"9306380","9309340"," We've got a positive hero indicator on INTC."
"9309760","9310220"," Excuse me. "
"9310220","9312800"," The hero indicator is at 1140 positive."
"9313280","9319640"," We've got buyers, 493,000 to 429,000 on the south side."
"9320620","9324540"," Your price target today on INTC is 5644. "
"9325400","9329860"," If you're going to diamond and brickhand that shit, you're looking for 5692."
"9330520","9334260"," If you're one of those crazy bulls that thinks nope, we're crashing through these levels of"
"9334260","9334460"," resistance."
"9335440","9339120"," The big bad boy above is 5976. "
"9342900","9347360"," And if you're going to get really psycho bullish today, you're like, nope, INTC is going to the"
"9347360","9347540"," moon."
"9348780","9349840"," I'm going to tell you it's not."
"9350500","9352840"," It's probably going to be going to like 6053 at max. "
"9353240","9359420"," If you want to squeeze it above, which I don't ever see INTC squeezed too often, it's possible to"
"9359420","9362740"," buy the dip on INTC as 4896."
"9363420","9366820"," Or if you're getting bearish in INTC and you're like, hey, I want to take a short at some point."
"9368940","9373060"," You are going to be looking for some major resistance above here at 5943. "
"9373600","9376460"," You're going to be looking to sell it down to 4804."
"9376900","9380220"," If you're a bear out there, you should be listening me in that same context, right?"
"9380780","9382240"," And I'm showing you the bull side."
"9382840","9383760"," Just do the reverse. "
"9388120","9389420"," UVXY must have missed it."
"9389740","9390260"," Hold on here."
"9391160","9393140"," I'll do UVXY right now for you guys. "
"9395080","9399580"," Yeah, if I miss a ticker and I want you guys to all know that if I miss a ticker"
"9399580","9406320"," for you out there, I have, I don't get pissed off if you just, if you just like spam me."
"9406700","9408000"," It's like, hey, you missed UVXY."
"9408360","9409380"," You missed UVXY. "
"9410300","9411720"," I've been waiting for it all morning long."
"9412560","9412840"," Let me know."
"9413000","9416760"," The only thing that I ask for you to do is if you hit me with like 30, 40 tickers"
"9416760","9419120"," in the chat, I can't get to all of them. "
"9419680","9420440"," This is not going to happen."
"9422610","9423610"," We move on to other things."
"9424290","9425230"," Oh, we got a little bounce here. "
"9426350","9429790"," Let's look at our UVXY of a bounce here at 1284."
"9431450","9434750"," You have more sellers than buyers on UVXY."
"9436930","9438590"," And you have a negative flow. "
"9439990","9442570"," So lots of put buyers, right?"
"9442830","9444270"," We got lots of put buyers on UVXY."
"9446770","9451090"," We've got more sellers of UVXY than we have buyers."
"9452730","9460850"," If you are Uber bearish and want to buy some calls, I guess my assumption is that's what you're"
"9460850","9461050"," thinking. "
"9461710","9463290"," We're going to get Uber bearish."
"9463650","9467290"," So your price targets are $13.92, $15."
"9468850","9475070"," You're by the dip on UVXY right now is $10.44. And if you want to get really bearish, you"
"9475070","9476010"," guys want some bear porn. "
"9476830","9477770"," It's not that high, man."
"9477770","9482510"," It's like, yeah, we got $14.90, $15 down here."
"9483030","9488030"," The real by the dip on UVXY is $10.60. I'll show that to you guys once more. "
"9490710","9495630"," And we are crashing through some form of support here or selling down below."
"9496370","9497970"," You guys can take a snapshot of this."
"9498050","9499990"," You have more sellers than buyers on UVXY. "
"9500230","9503570"," This implies that the spy is going up just as a side note."
"9504050","9507790"," Sometimes on Fridays, you'll see us sell down the VIX into the clothes."
"9507790","9509490"," This is implying that we are. "
"9509710","9513910"," I haven't looked at the EVXY chart or the VIX chart yet this morning to tell you if I think"
"9513910","9514750"," we're going up or down."
"9514930","9515750"," I can look right now, though."
"9515950","9519090"," If you want someone else's opinion, you want to backtest your thought, your ideas. "
"9520110","9521590"," Let's see what other people think of your ideas."
"9523830","9524230"," Yeah."
"9525710","9529190"," If you're going to ask me, let's see. "
"9531990","9533750"," It's going to be a bigger chart for VIX."
"9542090","9543250"," I don't know."
"9547440","9550920"," We can even bigger chart for the VIX than the 15 minute of the VIX. "
"9556090","9558690"," Let's see if we can extrapolate anything out of the VIX."
"9566250","9571110"," The VIX is showing a bullish."
"9572290","9573050"," What's it called?"
"9573890","9576610"," Here it is called as an old school charting thing. "
"9577430","9580770"," I can just make some shit up, but it's getting very bullish."
"9581430","9587630"," I don't know that it's going to be bullish today, but I would expect by the 21st."
"9588890","9589810"," I'm going to expect. "
"9589810","9593930"," If you want the true feeling, you're going to see the VIX come down."
"9596470","9599690"," Base out here into next week, and you're going to see a ripper."
"9600750","9604170"," I'll post this chart right now on Twitter. "
"9604890","9607350"," If you're a VIX, I'm going to post it on at Captain's Alpha."
"9608130","9610110"," What my expectation would be and where the VIX goes."
"9610950","9613810"," It's very bullish, but it's not bullish today. "
"9615510","9622590"," It's very bullish, actually, though, into the 21st, which makes sense with that spot gamma note."
"9623310","9625990"," What I was talking about is spot gamma."
"9626170","9626890"," Did you guys hear all that?"
"9627590","9628710"," What I talked about on spot gamma?"
"9636450","9640650"," Let me know in the chat if you guys heard what I said about spot gamma. "
"9640650","9643170"," I talked about spot gamma for 10 minutes."
"9643630","9644790"," I want to make sure you guys all heard that."
"9645530","9646050"," It was important. "
"9646530","9647350"," Very important here."
"9648110","9649670"," Important to your market outlook."
"9653900","9662240"," If you heard me talk about spot gamma, like 10 minutes about the call gamma rolling off on the 21st"
"9662240","9663940"," of January, tell me if you heard it. "
"9666890","9669250"," No, VIX does not bullish in my view."
"9669750","9670810"," I could be wrong on this, of course."
"9671630","9672610"," Everybody has their own opinion. "
"9675900","9678780"," I'm posting it on at Captain's Alpha right now."
"9679180","9682860"," That's what I think happens heading into the 21st on the VIX."
"9687030","9688570"," OK, so that was the OK, Paul. "
"9688750","9689650"," So you need to hear this, Paul."
"9690010","9691250"," I know you need to hear this."
"9692630","9692990"," 100%. "
"9692990","9697090"," OK, so we're going to talk about this before I get a shot of whiskey, before I get drunk here."
"9697370","9699110"," Not drunk, but, you know, get a drink."
"9699790","9701850"," Have an afternoon lunch like the big boys do. "
"9703370","9708830"," All right, so we're going to start at the top."
"9711510","9716490"," It's important for you to listen to this morning or this afternoon heading into the afternoon hour."
"9716870","9718210"," Critical that you hear this. "
"9721750","9724170"," We did not see hedging yesterday."
"9725750","9732310"," And even in the SG note this morning that they released, they noted that we didn't get any hedging"
"9732310","9732630"," yesterday."
"9733090","9734150"," But we actually did. "
"9734710","9741770"," We got hedging at four o'clock, 412, 410 PM, $10 million or something on the spy."
"9742490","9747250"," The dealers didn't hedge that those puts in the overnight."
"9747550","9748610"," They did hedge them this morning. "
"9749010","9752070"," That's where that selloff came on this morning."
"9754150","9756950"," Now, we also saw hedging today."
"9757370","9760190"," I'm going to say this stuff before I read the SG note. "
"9760950","9764970"," And they would talk about in the SG note today if we see hedging today and we are."
"9765570","9768830"," We're not seeing it, though, in speculative growth stocks in the spy."
"9768830","9776010"," We're seeing the hedging in areas of the market that you want to see hedging for the market to sell"
"9776010","9776630"," down hard. "
"9777650","9780190"," You're seeing it in Kroger."
"9780490","9784070"," You're seeing it in that retail ETF that I talked about earlier."
"9784330","9785430"," I think it was XRT or something. "
"9786330","9788530"," That's important for the bear narrative."
"9789350","9794130"," Now, I'm looking today for more hedging on the spy, speculative growth."
"9794870","9797290"," Those kind of stocks as we head into the 21st. "
"9797290","9803370"," I want to make a note about what SG noted this morning, which is important and relevant."
"9805490","9809050"," They said the flows yesterday, this is quote, right?"
"9809690","9812950"," The flows yesterday were fairly neutral on S&P and the Qs."
"9813030","9817470"," We saw most of the options based pressure coming from cost selling in single stocks, which makes"
"9817470","9817770"," sense. "
"9818130","9819410"," We know we're not going to $500."
"9819890","9821270"," We know we're not going to $480."
"9822130","9824830"," More than likely, we're only going to trade up to $475, $478. "
"9824830","9829490"," We know that our trading levels are coming down in the market, right?"
"9829930","9831210"," This is similar to what the flow."
"9831730","9837270"," This is similar to what we saw earlier this month, where our index model didn't show heavy hedging,"
"9837650","9841090"," but there was strong song call selling in tech leaders."
"9841590","9844650"," This was sparked by concerns around interest rates. "
"9846310","9849710"," Rate increases that led to sector rotation out of tech into financials."
"9849910","9854270"," Based on this, we think a lot of the flow was driven by tech stock selling from a more macro "
"9854270","9855110","-focused players."
"9855630","9860470"," In other words, it was single stock selling the track down the index as indices. "
"9860810","9865150"," We never saw the S&P term structure shift back to our backward dated state, which would indicate"
"9865150","9866190"," major hedging demand."
"9867050","9870650"," In the last several sessions, this is where it's important."
"9871330","9876490"," In the last several sessions, interest rate concerns eased, which led to a quick rally in many of"
"9876490","9877270"," the oversold names. "
"9877270","9884370"," However, with yesterday's Fed rate comments, the tech and meme selling resumed in similar fashion"
"9884370","9887970"," to early January, tech selling but little index hedging."
"9888530","9893110"," Now, that part there, right, but little index hedging, we actually did see index hedging yesterday."
"9893350","9894810"," It was at the end of the day. "
"9895030","9899970"," Those trades were closed this morning, but they were used as a push."
"9900430","9902390"," We do that on the call side as well, right?"
"9902390","9908110"," We do that push when cash market can't raise this up to look above."
"9908650","9911270"," Same thing happened yesterday is closed. "
"9911710","9917490"," If you were hung around yesterday in this podcast, we watched them come in."
"9917830","9927820"," We stayed around until 4.15. Now, with that being said, should that index hedging demand increase,"
"9928520","9933560"," it would likely lead to a larger spike in implied volatility and a large decline in markets."
"9934680","9938060"," What they're stating to you is that you want to be looking today. "
"9938060","9944040"," If you're a market participant, it is important for you today to pay attention to any hedging"
"9944040","9945080"," activity that comes in."
"9945700","9948520"," I talked about XRT, I think, and I talked about Kroger."
"9948960","9952900"," We're going to review some more of the hedges that are coming in today and where they're focused on"
"9952900","9953220"," the market. "
"9953860","9955940"," I want to talk about the implications to the statement here."
"9957480","9959940"," Now, should we see hedging demand increases?"
"9960820","9964720"," There'll be a large spike in implied volatility and a large decline in markets."
"9965360","9966140"," We're looking at the VIX. "
"9966300","9969720"," I just posted a VIX chart showing you should see some settling in the VIX."
"9970180","9972400"," I'm going to write a large spike heading into the 21st."
"9972560","9975840"," I'm going to explain why I posted the chart like that. "
"9977040","9983140"," Now, we've made several comments in regards to 121, January 21, OPEX being of significant size."
"9984200","9989120"," Now, when they made that comment on SG and SPACM, I don't remember those comments."
"9989720","9993220"," What I do remember about those comments is when those calls came in. "
"9993880","9996620"," We knew that we could trade higher, and we did."
"9996700","9999920"," We traded up to 478, I think, when those calls came in."
"10000020","10001760"," We had an expansion of range in the market. "
"10002860","10004880"," So maybe that's what they're implying in that comment."
"10006580","10009620"," But I haven't heard anything negative, and I don't read SG every day."
"10009620","10012160"," I don't read it in the morning in the afternoon every day. "
"10012440","10016280"," I read them sometimes, but maybe they had mentioned them, whatever, and move on."
"10017140","10022720"," But this OPEX is not a major index event, but holds very large, deep in the money, single-stop"
"10022720","10023360"," positions."
"10024200","10031080"," As shown in the chart below, we show something north of 125 billion and notional call delta is"
"10031080","10031600"," expiring. "
"10032280","10037800"," Initially, one would assume that this would lead to single stocks coming for sale into and around"
"10037800","10038620"," 121 OPEX."
"10039360","10040860"," But we already know that, right?"
"10041120","10042440"," Well, generally speaking, we already know that."
"10042580","10044520"," Every OPEX, we know we sell down. "
"10044800","10048960"," We talked about it last week or the week before we said, if you're not out of your calls by"
"10048960","10053680"," the 10th, expect us to trade down into the Thursday of OPEX this month, right?"
"10053780","10054680"," We've talked about that, right?"
"10054860","10056540"," When do we expect the markets to sell down this month?"
"10056820","10060200"," Of course, it's on the 10th and further out, right?"
"10060940","10063560"," There's a little bit later this month, but we know it's coming."
"10064060","10065340"," All the bulls should know that it's coming."
"10065340","10072080"," It comes every single month, but they're making a note that because this call delta is rolling off,"
"10072400","10074880"," that it could be amplified, okay?"
"10075520","10081900"," So if you have more call delta rolling off this month on into OPEX than normal, you're already"
"10081900","10085040"," going to get more volatility and already get deeper selling down. "
"10085320","10089500"," If more hedging comes in on those single tickers, where are those calls are?"
"10089960","10091760"," So if all these calls are on Apple, let's say, right?"
"10091760","10096100"," All those calls are on Tesla, all those calls are on your favorite tickers, and then you see"
"10096100","10099380"," massive hedging on these tickers leading into OPEX."
"10100100","10106100"," Or the expiration of those calls that call delta into OPEX, you could see a quick move down in the"
"10106100","10107640"," indexes and those single stocks."
"10108280","10110300"," So you're kind of like doubling up on selling the market. "
"10112120","10117720"," Now we haven't seen those put hedges yet in those major tickers, but I don't know that we even need"
"10117720","10120640"," to see them for us to even trade down significantly."
"10121740","10125460"," Okay, so now then they're making it, that's that statement, right?"
"10125740","10126680"," Large decline in markets."
"10127360","10131640"," Initially, one would assume that this would lead to single stocks coming to sale in two and around"
"10131640","10132820"," 121 OPEX. "
"10133180","10136720"," For this reason, we've been watching the forevolatility into and around OPEX."
"10137340","10141260"," A full analysis will be done today, but given the volatility, we're flagging this for you all day"
"10141260","10141720"," long today."
"10142460","10149520"," Okay, so anyways, what their point is that you might see this hedging show up in apples, Teslas,"
"10149720","10154240"," misfits, whatever tickers that you see out there, Amazon, anything holding up the market. "
"10154720","10160760"," It would double amplify a larger sell down into the 21st or maybe the 20th."
"10161500","10162660"," Let's say, excuse me."
"10163160","10164660"," So you see this large sell down. "
"10165520","10167960"," So far, as of yet, we haven't seen that hedging come in."
"10168460","10173320"," But to note is that we are seeing hedging coming in where all the bulls are hiding in these"
"10173320","10177160"," cyclical, in these consumer defensive stocks this morning."
"10177160","10182800"," And I'm going to review these hedges that are coming in today as we, when I come back from lunch"
"10182800","10184680"," here, not really lunch, but I'm going to go get a whiskey. "
"10185360","10187040"," I'm going to grab the list of people that have donated."
"10187700","10190640"," I'll come back and we'll track these hedges that are coming in."
"10191120","10197320"," And surprisingly, we're not seeing them on Apple yet, but we are seeing them in these places that"
"10197320","10201900"," let's say you let the call delta roll off into OPEX. "
"10202300","10209040"," So you already have some selling happening in the market, and then you start to see another hit in"
"10209040","10211320"," other sectors of the market at the same time."
"10211900","10213460"," And that would scare a guy like me."
"10213560","10215220"," If I was a guy like me, I'm looking for that. "
"10215560","10218400"," I'm looking for, let's say, Kroger to sell down."
"10218540","10227900"," I'm looking for, you know, anything that's like John Deere, Home Depot, any of those, any of those,"
"10228100","10232260"," like I'm hiding in these financials, you're hiding in financials, you're hiding in energy, let's"
"10232260","10232460"," say."
"10232460","10237920"," And if you start to see that hedging activity coming in, you see this call delta rolling off. "
"10238460","10242760"," And you already know that the bulls know that we're not trading higher than a certain number,"
"10243020","10243060"," right?"
"10243480","10245200"," The bulls are saying, well, we're not going to 480."
"10245700","10246760"," We're not going to 500."
"10247340","10254140"," You start to see that call, you know, when you're, you know, if you have calls out here at 500"
"10254140","10259660"," and you got puts down here at 460, and then you're saying, well, you know, we're not going to 500,"
"10259660","10262360"," so I'm going to only buy calls to 480, right?"
"10262660","10264380"," And then I'm going to buy some puts down here to 450. "
"10265280","10267640"," And then we go, ah, you know, this morning it's Friday."
"10267760","10269140"," We're trading down here at 460."
"10269720","10274060"," I'll just buy it in the money, 460 calls instead of 470s now. "
"10274680","10279340"," And you got bears saying, well, I'm going to buy some 445s and 450s, right?"
"10279520","10280440"," Or 400s."
"10280620","10283880"," You start to see our trading range when we've been seeing it, right?"
"10284060","10286120"," We knew that we're not trading out above a 500 anymore."
"10286120","10289560"," We know we're not trading at 478 anymore or 480. "
"10290300","10296280"," And now we've got bulls saying, maybe we'll start trading at 470 on a high and 460 is the bottom."
"10296820","10298100"," And you got bears saying, oh, maybe it's 450."
"10298880","10305260"," And you'll start to see our implied moves in the market trade down from now into March. "
"10305540","10311580"," Even if we're trading within this range, you'll see it start to move down into that March period,"
"10311580","10311840"," right?"
"10312060","10315420"," Until market participants say, ooh, you know what?"
"10315420","10321020"," Spy looks cheap or Apple looks cheap or Tesla looks cheap or, you know, whatever, Amazon looks"
"10321020","10326260"," cheap or, ooh, you don't ask you, is trading down at 50 bucks or whatever it is, you know, 30"
"10326260","10326880"," bucks or whatever."
"10327420","10329100"," Whatever ticker it is that you like out there."
"10329820","10336800"," And until we reach that level, we're going to continue to sell down and our range is going to"
"10336800","10339120"," continue to move down in the market. "
"10341600","10347900"," So while that's happening, you're also going to get big movers out there."
"10348000","10348460"," You're going to get sharks."
"10348760","10355260"," You're going to get hedge funds, banks that know when to enter the market to amplify these moves. "
"10355740","10362380"," So if you've got a range, let's say, let's just say it's 460 now and 450, right?"
"10362880","10364460"," And let's say we're trading up at 460."
"10366600","10370700"," They're going to know how to amplify and move higher and know how to amplify and move lower."
"10371200","10373780"," They did that last night into today. "
"10374420","10381620"," And so as we move into the 21st, let's say you're planning your bank or your smart algo, quant "
"10381620","10385580","-driven kind of a firm or whatever, a HFT, whatever you are, and you're saying, okay, this is what"
"10385580","10385920"," we're going to do."
"10387580","10390760"," We're going to set this up so we know we have all these calls rolling off."
"10391140","10392080"," They're already helping us. "
"10392640","10396600"," We already know the market's going to trade down heading into OPEX."
"10396600","10400540"," So we'll start by hedging consumer defensive stocks."
"10401480","10405280"," We'll make those drop alongside the major indexes into OPEX. "
"10405480","10406200"," So panic everybody."
"10406760","10410100"," We'll start trading everything down to like, let's say 460, maybe 450."
"10410960","10415880"," And then we'll hit them with major hedging on Apple, Amazon, Tesla. "
"10417340","10420060"," And that's how you make that of that implied range."
"10420080","10424040"," That's how you swoop down even lower than, let's say, a 450."
"10424040","10427260"," So let's say we're trading down to 450 into OPEX. "
"10427460","10431360"," Or let's say we trade up now, we trade down into OPEX to 460."
"10432600","10437920"," Once more, you can manipulate the market to trade down even deeper."
"10438280","10440260"," 450, 440 somewhere in there. "
"10443680","10445000"," You guys understand all these concepts?"
"10447120","10449720"," Am I losing some of you out there with these concepts or no?"
"10452220","10452920"," You guys don't care?"
"10453260","10454400"," You guys are like, fuck it, whatever."
"10454940","10455960"," Trade whatever's in front of me."
"10457840","10458900"," NQ needs to defend. "
"10459400","10459680"," Okay."
"10465850","10467650"," B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A."
"10469150","10469950"," Yeah, what's this?"
"10470570","10472390"," What's Voor N-G-O?"
"10472770","10473530"," What does that mean?"
"10476610","10477990"," Yeah, I'll just buy the dip. "
"10478250","10478850"," That's what Eric's like."
"10481450","10482930"," Eric's like, I'll just buy the dip."
"10484490","10494530"," Okay, so let's look at, um, let's look at Voor"
"10494530","10494870"," G-O. "
"10494870","10496210"," What does this say?"
"10496370","10500190"," NQ has seven closed bloop below 100 day."
"10509180","10513960"," Yeah, so that's more than likely what's going to happen into OPEX."
"10514340","10522410"," I want you guys to be aware of that because I want you to be aware of that because there"
"10522410","10526930"," are some market players trading that trade into OPEX. "
"10527950","10537370"," And if S-G is reporting that, then I want you to know that you'll probably have Discords talking"
"10537370","10537910"," about it."
"10537990","10539770"," You'll probably see it talked about on Twitter."
"10540330","10541830"," You'll see it talked about in trading rooms. "
"10542030","10542670"," Yadda yadda yadda."
"10543870","10545990"," Okay, so support on spy."
"10546330","10547190"," Nothing's changed on spy. "
"10547990","10549030"," Are you going spy?"
"10561930","10567570"," I guess the Voor N-G-O might be someone was one of these guys out here who knows all"
"10567570","10569670"," the lingo for gamer speak."
"10570210","10570730"," Maybe it's one of those."
"10571630","10572550"," So there goes spy. "
"10575180","10576340"," Yeah, big boiler room."
"10576420","10576600"," Exactly."
"10576820","10577420"," Willy smoked me. "
"10578360","10580460"," The big boiler rooms are planning that."
"10582040","10584740"," But that still doesn't mean, oh, okay, wait a minute."
"10584820","10588460"," Your wife's boyfriend is saying B.A. like 10 times. "
"10589140","10590200"," Now 20 times."
"10590900","10595160"," B.A. B.A. B.A. B.A. Okay, so Boeing Boeing Boeing."
"10602810","10603950"," We'll do Boeing next. "
"10613380","10615060"," So B.A. is coming up right now."
"10621190","10622750"," Am I getting this B.A. or no?"
"10623370","10624110"," It's happening or what?"
"10637280","10637720"," Okay."
"10639040","10648720"," We already did B.A. We're trying on Boeing here. "
"10651720","10654040"," Big rip through support."
"10654500","10657180"," Our resistance here back here at 222."
"10658620","10659580"," Ricocheting off. "
"10660800","10675730"," 223.92. More buyers and sellers on B.A. You're"
"10675730","10675970"," holding."
"10676350","10676730"," What are you holding?"
"10676950","10679050"," 222.223 C's."
"10685240","10686780"," Quadri-Quadwitching and OPEX are. "
"10688300","10689700"," OPEX is a part of quadwitching."
"10689920","10692140"," Quadwitching is not a part of OPEX."
"10692920","10693800"," Or I guess, I don't know. "
"10693880","10694660"," I guess it's a part of it."
"10695080","10696540"," OPEX is a part of quadwitching."
"10703960","10705380"," And there's the three witches. "
"10706480","10707600"," There's other witches too."
"10707700","10708380"," It's not just quad."
"10717460","10719340"," I don't want to say to you, your wife's boyfriend. "
"10719340","10721520"," It looks like you're at some serious resistance here."
"10721880","10724400"," If I was a bear, I'd be taking the short position here."
"10727200","10730200"," You do have slightly more buyers and sellers. "
"10731960","10734360"," There has been a lot of call flow into airlines."
"10736340","10737620"," Even this morning there is."
"10739700","10745140"," If I had an expectation on B.A., maybe it is bank longs that are trying to get. "
"10745700","10747980"," This might be a nice ride up for you, your wife's boyfriend."
"10748420","10755760"," If banks haven't seen the print that they're looking for on B.A., maybe they'll try to trade it up"
"10755760","10756180"," to $250."
"10756840","10759240"," This might be a nice trade still. "
"10761220","10762800"," Not bearish on B.A. right now."
"10764520","10768280"," You ever notice when they kill a market, they try to pump up some stocks?"
"10769720","10771240"," They don't come down any farther."
"10771760","10773620"," They might be doing that here on B.A. Brother. "
"10779330","10781250"," XRT is trashed on all time frames."
"10782070","10785890"," XRT has, I don't know, a million dollar put on it right now in the money."
"10787330","10790470"," And it's never come down since 2019. "
"10791430","10793950"," XRT needs to be shorted into the ground, in my view."
"10795370","10796690"," I'll check PayPal for you."
"10797730","10799230"," Mother-in-law, which is the worst. "
"10801610","10810280"," I like the idea of B.A. trading up."
"10810280","10815180"," I like the idea of banks getting out of their longs in B.A. before the market sells."
"10816940","10818280"," I'm still bullish here. "
"10818920","10822640"," I would take your money and run if it was me, your wife's boyfriend."
"10823040","10827100"," But at the same time, I can see the logic behind thinking that B.A. goes up."
"10829880","10833600"," I can see it, I can see it, unless we sell the market and they haven't done it at that"
"10833600","10834400"," point. "
"10835300","10837240"," But you know that the banks are greedy."
"10837240","10838440"," Yup."
"10848450","10849050"," Simultaneously. "
"10851510","10853890"," So SQ and PayPal, we'll do those next."
"10858940","10860080"," Are you shitting me?"
"10860900","10864380"," Trading rooms are still telling members to buy the fucking dip on DKNG."
"10866340","10866940"," Goddamn. "
"10870040","10871520"," Fucking trading rooms, man."
"10877410","10886730"," I saw, I'm not going to name a name, but one of the famous YouTubers, man, I saw one of"
"10886730","10888110"," his videos pop up in my feed."
"10888250","10889730"," I didn't even watch the whole thing. "
"10890470","10892450"," I couldn't bring myself to watch it."
"10893090","10898910"," And it was talking about buying the dip on some of these fucking stocks and I'm like, I'm like,"
"10899070","10900330"," what are you telling people?"
"10901050","10903370"," Like, you got to put risk on now and I'm like, no."
"10905030","10906390"," Not in these stocks yet. "
"10910350","10913410"," I was, I don't know why he was saying that to people."
"10914150","10916750"," Like, you would day trade and stuff, that's one thing."
"10917850","10919950"," But this guy was telling you to like invest. "
"10921030","10929850"," I was like, I don't know."
"10929850","10931370"," I was in today's support, 130."
"10932210","10932890"," I likey. "
"10933510","10935830"," More sellers though than buyers on SQ."
"10936570","10939690"," We're going to talk about SQ real quick, because we talked about it yesterday."
"10941070","10951590"," So if you're a bull, and the implication is that every year, we trade down, right?"
"10952210","10956910"," At some point, if it ain't happening in January and February, it's happened in July, right?"
"10959050","10964690"," Where is bottom for SQ?"
"10967760","10970040"," And we're getting pretty damn close to it. "
"10972380","10976460"," It's pretty damn close."
"10977160","10979200"," It's got to look below down here."
"10983080","10984700"," You got a hundred bucks here. "
"10985680","10987040"," 90 bucks back here."
"10988280","10988840"," $120."
"10995220","10996300"," One, two. "
"11000000","11002960"," Let me look and see where I've got a buy set up for the SQ."
"11011180","11019580"," So SQ, my buy is ready for it."
"11019580","11020940"," That's where I want to buy SQ. "
"11024100","11029760"," Between now and March, I'll show you where I want to buy SQ."
"11035550","11036590"," So 90 bucks."
"11037970","11038890"," Call it right now. "
"11039090","11041990"," Mark that in your chart, 91, 55, and $100."
"11042550","11043550"," That's my buy zone right here."
"11047100","11049760"," We are at some pretty significant support right now. "
"11049760","11053160"," When you can't deny that this is not significant support here."
"11055140","11057220"," I'm not going to deny that it's significant support."
"11063340","11064500"," Got 130 bucks. "
"11065380","11067260"," It's fallen substantially."
"11070380","11075640"," It just touched 130 bucks, but all I'm looking for is capitulation."
"11076620","11085400"," I want like that last diamond handed SQ bowl to sell his soul and give me his shares. "
"11086080","11086500"," They're cheap."
"11090850","11092150"," That's how bad I am."
"11092370","11095250"," You guys, I'm like, I'm a bull, but I'm a cheap ass bull. "
"11099750","11101750"," Yeah, dollar cost averaging is stupid."
"11102410","11103410"," In my view, it is."
"11108600","11112360"," I'll post the settings for, I'll post the settings for. "
"11118470","11120670"," There's an accumulation dispersion phase, right?"
"11120830","11123690"," We all know that you got to look for when the banks got into stocks."
"11124550","11126490"," These banks want to take profit."
"11127590","11130150"," And not only do they want to take profit, this is where it gets tricky. "
"11132940","11137540"," So the banks want to take profit that we don't retail doesn't move stocks."
"11138200","11139760"," And we influence it to an extent."
"11140760","11143400"," We influence the news and all that kind of stuff out there. "
"11144260","11147860"," But the banks influence these stocks moving, okay?"
"11149060","11153600"," And they push them up, then retail, get involved, be out of whatever, right?"
"11153800","11155020"," And we see the stock go up."
"11155560","11158800"," Then the banks want to take profit in these trades."
"11159700","11164340"," And then you have to figure they want to be in at a better price than you are. "
"11164400","11165960"," They always want to be ahead of you."
"11166680","11168500"," So they're going to eat."
"11168760","11173320"," So let's say they take their profit, they're going to then reassess this company and say, okay, is"
"11173320","11175820"," SQ going anywhere after this trade is done?"
"11176120","11178500"," Is Peton going anywhere after this trade is done?"
"11179260","11182980"," If they think, no, Peton's really should be like a $10, $30 stock or whatever. "
"11183320","11183580"," Okay."
"11184020","11189420"," Now if they think, well, P, well, square though is going to be wrapped up in people's lives, then"
"11189420","11190260"," they're going to say, okay."
"11190820","11195460"," So what we're going to do is we're going to ultra short this thing down for capitulation, make"
"11195460","11197500"," everybody feel as though it's going to crash, never come back. "
"11197660","11200860"," We're going to release all these news stories that SQ and block sucks."
"11201020","11201840"," It's never come back."
"11202480","11205460"," We have some dirt underneath the rug that we haven't told anybody about. "
"11205900","11207320"," So release some bad press on SQ."
"11208240","11209620"," We'll dump it down real fast."
"11210240","11214580"," It might take one week, might take three days, might take a month, might take a day. "
"11215220","11217200"," And they drop it as deep as they possibly can."
"11218560","11223400"," So let's say they don't rebuy Peton when it falls, but they do rebuy SQ or some other ticker, it"
"11223400","11224140"," doesn't matter what it is."
"11224980","11227420"," And then they're in it, some dirt cheap price. "
"11228020","11231280"," And you've sold now, you've capitulated, you've listened to all the bad news."
"11232180","11233680"," All of a sudden SQ swoops back up."
"11234760","11241480"," And let's say you capitulated out of 130 bucks and it's down at 90 bucks, let's say, right?"
"11241680","11245760"," But it moves from 90 to 150 before you even have a chance. "
"11247440","11248820"," It's like swoop down, swoop back up."
"11248820","11256040"," It's back on its original trading trend line from two years ago."
"11256280","11260840"," Not the one that's straight to the moon, but the trend line that it had before 2020. "
"11262120","11263200"," But you're out, right?"
"11263760","11264420"," You're screwed now."
"11265220","11270580"," And so that's what some of the, that's what some of the dark cost average traders are saying."
"11270980","11272440"," That's what some of the pumpers are saying. "
"11273240","11275680"," But in reality, what happens to an investor in a trader?"
"11276040","11278460"," The reality is they buy here at 130."
"11279200","11282940"," We sell it down and they capitulate, lose all their money and they buy back at a 150."
"11283560","11286980"," So you have like what the pumpers are telling you to do and we have that the reality is for"
"11286980","11290660"," most people, is that they do the opposite of what they should do. "
"11291580","11293720"," So do I think that you buy here at 130?"
"11293960","11296440"," No, I think that you wait for 90 or 100 bucks and you buy there."
"11296680","11298460"," You'll feel better about yourself, you'll sleep better at nighttime."
"11304150","11305570"," I'll do PayPal next after SQ. "
"11316720","11318280"," And then, you know, if I had 90 bucks."
"11320320","11324100"," Like SQ as an example, if I buy it at 90 bucks, I'll sell puts all day long."
"11325400","11327560"," All day long as I'll put, so sell puts for the next year. "
"11338940","11341640"," And I don't think all tickers are coming back from that 2020 trade either."
"11342080","11347020"," I just think that I've got a list of stocks that I think are coming back, have the potential to"
"11347020","11349000"," come back, even if they're not always profitable."
"11349840","11351880"," Do I think Roblox is not coming back?"
"11352780","11355620"," I think you're fucking smoking crack if you think Roblox is not coming back. "
"11356620","11357580"," Smoking fucking crack."
"11361460","11365200"," If an article is born, they were like, well Roblox doesn't turn a profit."
"11367460","11369720"," And I'm like, you're smoking crack if you think Roblox is coming back. "
"11369880","11372160"," That's like saying, I don't know."
"11372220","11375620"," It's like saying, oh, I guess, you know, we did see AOL go bankrupt, right?"
"11376200","11378500"," We saw pets, pets.com or pet smart or whatever."
"11379220","11380060"," Pets.com go bankrupt. "
"11381340","11382940"," But do I think Roblox is going bankrupt?"
"11383480","11384100"," No fucking way."
"11387590","11389610"," You got to put risk on in this market at some point."
"11390270","11392210"," And I'm putting the risk on in Roblox. "
"11397240","11398600"," Somewhere you have to put risk on."
"11399440","11401720"," Unless you're buying like, I don't know, Clorox bleach."
"11402260","11409520"," If you're buying Clorox bleach, you're in the wrong fucking, you're in the wrong fucking, I don't"
"11409520","11413440"," know, live stream, right?"
"11414160","11415760"," Because you have to put some risk on somewhere. "
"11416280","11422220"," Unless you're trading Clorox bleach and, I don't know, Arm and Hammer, Arm and Hammer fucking bacon"
"11422220","11423300"," soda or some shit."
"11424620","11428420"," I think Roblox is a better bet than Peton."
"11429200","11431680"," You guys think Peton is a better stock than Roblox?"
"11432600","11433540"," I doubt that. "
"11435980","11436460"," Shit."
"11436680","11440160"," To some extent, I think Roblox is a better ticker for the metaverse than Facebook."
"11441480","11451480"," I think Facebook reminds me more of AOL when it comes to their dealings and where the metaverse is"
"11451480","11455560"," going to be versus, you know, if you're looking back, you had to look back at AOL and you're like,"
"11455560","11457060"," is this the future of the internet?"
"11457560","11458020"," Fuck no. "
"11458740","11460740"," Google was the future of internet back then."
"11461100","11461900"," Even I remember that."
"11462620","11467180"," Google was blowing away AOL and how that happened was the web browser. "
"11468640","11470380"," It was the simplicity of Google basically."
"11471480","11473720"," The cleanness of it, the speed of it."
"11474980","11480560"," So when I look at Roblox and their openness, right, the openness of Roblox. "
"11480560","11483880"," There's a couple of other tickers that, and they're user base."
"11484280","11486120"," You got billions of people using Roblox."
"11487160","11487560"," Billions. "
"11490320","11491840"," Same things going on with PayPal."
"11492480","11493380"," Great support here."
"11494280","11495780"," Should make a bull feel comfortable. "
"11496260","11497500"," Do I think you can day trade this probably?"
"11497900","11499340"," Probably day trade this up to 195."
"11502620","11503800"," By the dip is at 170."
"11506120","11508860"," By the dip is from right where we are to 174. "
"11509720","11511360"," You're real by the dip is at 170."
"11511940","11514140"," And then if you guys want to see where I think it's going."
"11517810","11519090"," I don't think it happens today though. "
"11520150","11521030"," I'm bullish."
"11521310","11523190"," I don't mind buying dips right now still."
"11523830","11527550"," But I do think that we have a fair chance of trading down deeply. "
"11529710","11530550"," Where's that number?"
"11533330","11533770"," 150."
"11534790","11536730"," Right now it's saying it's at 170."
"11538450","11540630"," But maybe this might be the dip for this. "
"11540630","11541990"," This might be the deepest PayPal goes."
"11542370","11543030"," I could see that."
"11544130","11547090"," I'll give the benefit of the doubt on PayPal over square. "
"11548010","11548910"," As this being the dip."
"11549410","11550330"," That's not a bad."
"11551590","11552310"," It's not a bad. "
"11552490","11553610"," I think PayPal's a bad."
"11553750","11555150"," I think PayPal's a shit company."
"11555950","11557010"," But I think they make more money. "
"11557690","11559950"," And they have their fingers in everything more than square does."
"11561010","11563530"," So yeah, let's call PayPal 170."
"11564410","11566310"," I want to buy PayPal 170. "
"11568880","11573840"," Maybe dollar cost average like the pumpers say down here to 165, 160 and 150."
"11574740","11578300"," But generally PayPal is probably closer to a bottom than square is."
"11581410","11584290"," You guys want to see it on a more granular level. "
"11584530","11585970"," You guys want to see above what you're looking for?"
"11586730","11586990"," On square."
"11587610","11588230"," I'll show you that too."
"11592820","11593260"," Here you go. "
"11598420","11598900"," 192."
"11601140","11602120"," That's your price target."
"11603120","11605360"," This looks like a pretty big wall here. "
"11605360","11606660"," 192 to 200."
"11606960","11609780"," This looks like, you know, bulls don't believe we're going higher than this."
"11609780","11610800"," This makes sense too. "
"11614700","11615980"," I like PayPal as a company."
"11616060","11616560"," I want to own PayPal."
"11620900","11621860"," Didn't I just do PayPal?"
"11630010","11634470"," Yeah, your puts should be getting someone's making a note that outside the money puts are getting"
"11634470","11635190"," wrecked right now. "
"11636010","11636470"," That's a sign."
"11636810","11637910"," I think we still go up again."
"11640910","11643230"," I think AOL was the future in the 90s. "
"11643890","11647930"," I remember AOL being it was it was like the late to mid 90s."
"11649190","11651810"," It was like 92 to 96 or something."
"11663430","11670180"," You're welcome on B.A. I'll go back to spy here right arms back on spy right now. "
"11670420","11672420"," This is all grinding that's taking place right now."
"11676030","11678550"," Give me a look at CDNA for you."
"11681910","11683890"," Yeah, I like I like SQ. "
"11683990","11685090"," I just don't like it like I like PayPal."
"11686110","11686770"," I'll do pen."
"11688530","11689770"," Yeah, all you guys have a great week. "
"11690950","11692150"," Hey Brad, good to see you brother."
"11701200","11704200"," So Wilson Chan is asking is there a spy trade today?"
"11704820","11706200"," Do you guys want a trade right now?"
"11706300","11706860"," I can give you a trade."
"11708520","11709100"," Wait a minute. "
"11713040","11714920"," You guys want to know what the spy trade is today?"
"11715500","11716320"," I'll tell you what it is."
"11718260","11719460"," I'll tell you exactly what it is."
"11719580","11724120"," You're going to hope and pray that spy trades up to like 465 today into the bell. "
"11725240","11727680"," You're going to buy some put spreads for OPEX."
"11729400","11731020"," That's the trade today on spy."
"11732660","11734120"," You want to know what the trade is in spy?"
"11734320","11734840"," That's what it is. "
"11735100","11735940"," You have to wait for it."
"11739880","11741760"," So more uber calls coming in."
"11741980","11743640"," Been talking about uber all morning long. "
"11744590","11752900"," Uber Uber Uber February 18 47.5. Next thing DKNG."
"11753800","11757140"," Massive put cut or call puts coming in on DKNG."
"11757880","11767360"," Massive massive puts March 18 22.5 puts right 1.3 million dollars. "
"11767640","11770520"," Huge trade against DKNG."
"11774420","11777080"," Uber all day long calls all day long."
"11777360","11779320"," INTC had calls all day long. "
"11782760","11783960"," INTC 41460C."
"11784320","11785540"," That's a trade to take."
"11787740","11792980"," INTC 60C 414 1.3 million dollars. "
"11793040","11794200"," I think we called that one earlier."
"11796400","11797500"," Next trade for today."
"11800840","11801760"," I'll say it again. "
"11804480","11808360"," DKNG March 18 22.5 P."
"11812020","11814240"," We'll bring up uber next and see where it's sitting."
"11815880","11820420"," And yeah, you're looking to you're looking to re hedge a position on spy again today."
"11821160","11823780"," Into the close for OPEX next week. "
"11827390","11835390"," If you are going to hedge into OPEX next week, I would take the Friday or Monday, which would be"
"11835390","11842490"," the 21st or 24th on puts."
"11843250","11850150"," And that is so just in case we trade higher on that Thursday, you don't get wrecked in your puts."
"11851270","11857370"," There's a fair chance that the Thursday of this week's week, let's say we're burning down to the"
"11857370","11860030"," pits of hell this week on the spy. "
"11860550","11864750"," There is still a chance that we will swing higher at some point."
"11865770","11873450"," So if you're uber bearish, you're going to be looking to take a position today, expiring next week"
"11873450","11878710"," at some point on Friday or Monday after this upcoming next Friday or the Monday after."
"11882430","11885710"," Yes, crazy puts or crazy calls coming in an uber right now. "
"11887900","11891380"," And I like that trade, even though we're crashing down here in the support area."
"11891380","11899980"," Even though we have more puts than calls, if you can find a position on uber at like $40"
"11899980","11909610"," and by 47.5c. Regardless of where it's trading right now, there is massive"
"11909610","11910850"," call flow coming in."
"11911150","11912810"," Probably an insider knows something. "
"11913270","11917610"," I don't know what they know about uber, but there's a lot of money flow in uber right now."
"11918390","11921030"," A whole lot of money flow in uber right now."
"11923560","11931040"," If you look at a traditional chart, I guess you're waiting for uber to hit, I don't know, $28, $34"
"11931040","11931920"," or something. "
"11932600","11936920"," We can look below and see if there's even more buyers down at the $30 or $40 level."
"11938260","11940420"," There's $39 right there."
"11941480","11943540"," There's $38 right there. "
"11944080","11950380"," Maybe if you're uber bearish, you're thinking that we're going to trade down an uber to $33."
"11951100","11952040"," We'll look at that level."
"11954390","11956610"," $37, there's a lot of support there. "
"11959670","11962930"," $36, I guess if you're a bull and you want to be super duper safe."
"11966610","11968270"," $35 has major support."
"11968850","11970210"," Let's look at $33 and see. "
"11970890","11972270"," So $34 right?"
"11972810","11976070"," This is the place where some of the bears think it's going."
"11976730","11977070"," I'm assuming."
"11978070","11981570"," Bears think it's going down to $33 or $34 or $32. "
"11982450","11988110"," So $34 bucks if you want to be super duper safe, but there is massive, massive call flow coming in"
"11988110","11988390"," on uber."
"11988950","11989690"," Just heads up on that."
"11992740","11994340"," And right here $32. "
"11996060","12001680"," And you can see in the chart, if you look right here, you can see how this green wave stacks"
"12001680","12002100"," up."
"12002840","12005800"," So you've got a little bit of buyers here to $32."
"12006800","12008380"," From $33 to $32. "
"12008640","12010760"," Then you got $32 to $32 right here."
"12011240","12013900"," And you get $22,500."
"12013900","12017240"," So this is your buy the F&DIP on Uber. "
"12021600","12025020"," But there are massive call flow coming in on Uber right now."
"12025780","12026540"," I don't know why."
"12035140","12038240"," Uber Ears on February 9th. "
"12045960","12046800"," Here we go."
"12047000","12047940"," Look at one of these guys."
"12052300","12053280"," They got the Russians. "
"12054320","12055280"," They find this other Russian."
"12056060","12059920"," I'm going to find out how to get rid of Russian bots."
"12062160","12062980"," Russian bots. "
"12065760","12067040"," On YouTube chat."
"12067540","12068980"," That should cost money, right?"
"12072340","12074180"," I'm going to get rid of Russian bots."
"12078740","12080380"," Russian web brigades. "
"12081120","12086480"," Russian bots are state sponsored, anonymous internet, political commentators, and trolls."
"12088080","12088640"," Ooh."
"12096370","12098150"," So I'm going to have to look up on how to get rid of them. "
"12098770","12104330"," Anyways, if you're a Russian propagandist out there, lick my balls, lick them."
"12104530","12105370"," Lig my balls."
"12105970","12111540"," All right. "
"12112980","12114200"," Lig my balls."
"12120730","12121950"," Okay, so we're on Uber."
"12123390","12124370"," Crashing down through. "
"12125230","12126350"," Got more sellers than buyers."
"12126870","12128570"," Got a negative heroin indicator on Uber."
"12129370","12130670"," Got lots of calls coming in. "
"12130810","12132330"," Lots of dip buyers on Uber."
"12133030","12138230"," If you look on a traditional chart, it's a pretty bullish chart setup."
"12138790","12144290"," We are at the top of the channel trading down right now. "
"12144650","12148450"," I'm assuming that bears are thinking that we're going to trade down to for another bounce down"
"12148450","12152070"," below over here down at the $32 level."
"12152770","12157910"," I do want you to also realize though that the reason all these calls are coming in is because it"
"12157910","12160970"," is sitting on a pretty major support level here."
"12160970","12164930"," Back, we bounced here in September 8th. "
"12165210","12171470"," We bounced just slightly below traded, just slightly below but recovered here on November 30th."
"12172010","12177470"," So if you're wondering why we're bouncing here and why we probably won't trade down to $32 because"
"12177470","12178970"," bulls are betting that we're going up here."
"12179250","12180370"," This would be the third bounce. "
"12186050","12187190"," Task manager."
"12188010","12188330"," Discord."
"12190790","12191530"," And task. "
"12191530","12192170"," Get out of it."
"12192270","12192530"," Discord."
"12193510","12195190"," Discord's are freaking out right now. "
"12196650","12197770"," Yes, there's Uber."
"12203270","12204270"," Legima balls."
"12210590","12211170"," Legima. "
"12215390","12219410"," Trading the Qcom 190P one quarter has been working well today."
"12219610","12219710"," Yeah."
"12220310","12225250"," The Qcom puts were coming in like crazy. "
"12225250","12226950"," Look at how it touches like."
"12227290","12228990"," Hotches like I hate you day traders."
"12229650","12230690"," Hates day traders. "
"12232810","12234270"," RWM is dumping again."
"12236030","12237690"," Heavy puts on DKNG."
"12238050","12238710"," Heads up out there. "
"12239190","12245330"," If you are a DKNG bull that we're looking for hedge flow today."
"12245790","12248350"," We're seeing some spy puts coming in right now."
"12248730","12250610"," A little bit of spy calls, but mostly spy puts. "
"12250610","12255950"," I saw some talking briefly at a discord that I'm in."
"12258080","12260040"," I've seen some oxy calls."
"12260260","12261240"," OXY calls. "
"12261580","12262700"," Energy trade still on."
"12263420","12265100"," So if you want to be long, something be long energy."
"12265600","12266000"," XLE. "
"12266500","12266780"," Oxy."
"12267880","12271000"," There's a bunch of easy tickers you can look up to trade cash market."
"12272460","12272940"," DKNG. "
"12273900","12274560"," We'll look that one up."
"12276400","12278080"," That is 318."
"12278080","12280760"," 22.5 P."
"12281360","12282700"," Almost $2 million. "
"12305520","12308040"," And they were on my charts this morning."
"12308180","12309700"," I was looking at DKNG as well."
"12313970","12314970"," They're on my list. "
"12315530","12317850"," Do you guys want to know what I want to buy DKNG yet?"
"12319670","12321670"," My list for DKNG."
"12321950","12332390"," My buy zone for DKNG is $13.98. And $10.79. That's"
"12332390","12333790"," where I want to buy DKNG."
"12337450","12347390"," So we're bouncing off DKNG right now at 22.64. This looks like it's due"
"12347390","12347870"," to hedging. "
"12350370","12351590"," To be expected."
"12354610","12357610"," More minor support down below here at $22."
"12358290","12363570"," I bet you some of the bulls really hate me on DKNG. "
"12365710","12368470"," So we're crashing down right now in DKNG."
"12369430","12374430"," You've got 22.07. Then you've got $20."
"12376790","12381030"," But my buy zone is way down below way down here. "
"12383450","12385370"," Another support level at $18."
"12388270","12390190"," Let's see if we ever get back down to $13."
"12390510","12391950"," Because that might be wrong in this too. "
"12393410","12394490"," It looks like $15."
"12394970","12399430"," So I'm calling it at $13.98. So I'm going to raise mine up to $15."
"12404420","12406480"," And I want to see a sponsor $15. "
"12409580","12412140"," Yeah, so mark that in your chart $15."
"12413140","12414480"," There's a little bit of wamp."
"12414720","12415740"," Then I have that second. "
"12415900","12418540"," My second one is at $10.79. But it probably is at $12."
"12419320","12420560"," So I'll raise my bottom buy zone."
"12421440","12421620"," $12. "
"12423320","12425580"," I do want to talk to you guys out there briefly."
"12425780","12426700"," I'm going to go get a whiskey now."
"12427200","12427980"," I'm going to take a break. "
"12428340","12433160"," Now what I want to talk to you about is when we do these tickers, you should just be setting"
"12433160","12434040"," charts for yourself."
"12434620","12439680"," If you have anywhere from 100 to 300 tickers, you can pay for ticker alerts, right?"
"12440560","12443300"," You guys should never be chasing stocks out there."
"12443960","12446440"," Let's say like right now, we just did hood the other day. "
"12447240","12448860"," We just did Donkey Kong, right?"
"12450320","12455220"," What you do is you just set alerts at bottom for all these stocks."
"12456400","12458340"," Let's say you have a rolling average of stocks."
"12458340","12459700"," Let's say you have 100 stocks. "
"12460520","12463340"," Let's say then you build up to 200 or 300 stocks."
"12464360","12470340"," What you do is instead of falling in love with a company, you'll have an email alert or a text"
"12470340","12475360"," alert that comes to you and you'll get an alert and it says, hey, guess what?"
"12475760","12479120"," Take our XYZ and just hit your buy zone."
"12480100","12482980"," And that makes you know that now you're not chasing stocks. "
"12483980","12486360"," You don't care about charting them anymore."
"12487500","12490460"," And you just find out, well, why is Donkey Kong down it?"
"12490960","12494680"," You know, why is Donkey Kong down at 15 bucks?"
"12495400","12497400"," You can check all the news that's out on it."
"12497600","12503360"," If the news is just bullshit, if it's just where it's trading down to because of where it should be"
"12503360","12505980"," trading at, you can enter that trade, right?"
"12506080","12507400"," If you feel confident, then you have it. "
"12507880","12511500"," You've now disregarded dollar cost averaging."
"12512420","12517220"," Let's say DKNG ends up trading up to $50 and you miss that stock."
"12517880","12521160"," Well, it doesn't matter because you've got 300 others that you could have bought into. "
"12522080","12527080"," And now you have made successful trades more times than not, right?"
"12527800","12534400"," Because for every DKNG that you're buying that sells down, you're missing one that you could have"
"12534400","12535120"," bought at the bottom."
"12537400","12542420"," So I want you guys to understand how we do this, I guess, or how we do it here."
"12548000","12549100"," Yeah, I have the list. "
"12549300","12551280"," My list has been growing and changing."
"12552180","12555540"," And most of this list is what we've been discussing on this channel."
"12556860","12557640"," We could do it. "
"12558560","12560660"," I'm skiing tomorrow and Sunday."
"12561440","12565440"," I tried to do something on this past Sunday, but I couldn't get to it."
"12567540","12568200"," It's coming. "
"12568640","12569840"," I know I've said it's coming."
"12570400","12576900"," It doesn't really matter right now that it hasn't come, though, because this list is dependent upon"
"12576900","12581220"," these actions taking place, which it looks like they're happening."
"12582020","12584020"," Okay, so DKNG, we're going to get rid of this one. "
"12584440","12585060"," I'm going to go get a whiskey."
"12585720","12588340"," You guys get yourselves a bear or a water."
"12588960","12591820"," You can roll up a doobie if you are legally able to smoke weed. "
"12592860","12594280"," Grab a line of cocaine if you're in Columbia."
"12595380","12599700"," If you're in Amsterdam, grab some Molly some ecstasy."
"12600940","12604100"," If you're in Southeast Asia, grab an opium pipe. "
"12604900","12609540"," If you're in Utah, grab a National Geographic with some naked chicks in it."
"12610580","12618300"," If you're in California, grab me a, I don't know, a kale sandwich or something."
"12618960","12620120"," At least living in Cali. "
"12621060","12623080"," If you're in Texas, grab some brisket."
"12623960","12626500"," If you're in the South, grab some oysters on the half."
"12627820","12634060"," If you're in New England, get a shitty attitude together so you can tell me I suck, but that you"
"12634060","12635900"," love me in that weird way. "
"12636220","12638480"," If you're in the Midwest, just be quiet and sit down and listen."
"12641460","12645040"," If you're in Alaska, put your bear suit on."
"12646160","12647020"," I'll be right back. "
"12653180","12654760"," I'm going to go grab some bourbon."
"12654980","12655600"," I'll be right back."
"12655600","12658560"," I'm going to leave the feed up for you on spy. "
"12660060","12666530"," Oh, that sucks."
"12666770","12668110"," You can't illegally smoke weed."
"12671420","12673140"," I'll be right back 15 minutes. "
"12674940","12676020"," Right on Robert."
"12678900","12679840"," Grab a bear."
"12681460","12684600"," If you're in Dubai, I don't know what to say to you. "
"12685260","12687640"," I've got some friends that spend a lot of time in Dubai."
"12688240","12697860"," Hopefully, you can find some beautiful women and some great food, and find some friends to hang out"
"12697860","12697980"," with."
"12698040","12701400"," I used to have some great meals with some Saudis. "
"12702240","12703620"," I used to go and eat dinner with Saudis."
"12703960","12704300"," It was amazing."
"12705460","12706680"," Talk about, you never leave. "
"12707160","12708780"," It's like Acede with Russians, too."
"12709300","12710300"," In the Russians, you sit around."
"12710580","12711460"," You sit with a Russian family. "
"12711720","12712620"," They make these big, huge spreads."
"12713480","12714220"," Saudis do the same thing."
"12714500","12715100"," Big, huge spreads. "
"12715780","12716800"," Use your fingers."
"12717000","12717960"," Eat all these great foods."
"12718840","12722460"," If you're from Saudi Arabia right now, grab some food. "
"12724220","12725400"," Make some tea."
"12729140","12730040"," Grab a banana."

"12759330","12760490"," What have I got for Jersey?"
"12761130","12762750"," What is that ham sandwich called?"
"12762990","12766110"," I forget the ham sandwiches that I used to eat in Jersey from the deli. "
"12767750","12770330"," If you're from Jersey, grab some..."
"12771830","12775010"," What's that green..."
"12775010","12776730"," Grab a shot of Yaga Maista."
"12777330","12777950"," If you're from Jersey."
"12782570","12783610"," I've had some great meals. "
"12783770","12784790"," I've had some really close friends."
"12785650","12786130"," Sweden."
"12786790","12789550"," Pump some techno and some tech house. "
"12790310","12791710"," Grab some mo..."
"12791710","12792530"," You guys..."
"12792530","12793710"," Sweden's got it all, right?"
"12794110","12794990"," Sweden's got all the drugs."

"12817050","12819990"," You guys are just shit faced 24 hours a day."
"12820890","12821410"," Cleveland?"
"12823050","12824110"," Ahhh, shit."
"12824410","12825790"," Grab your chili and pasta. "

"12839870","12840670"," Too funny."
"12841210","12841810"," All right, I'll be right back."
"12841950","12842510"," It'll be five minutes. "
"12842670","12843230"," I'll be right back."
"12843650","12843910"," Five minutes."
"12845450","12847350"," Five minutes, boys and girls. "
"12847690","12847870"," Hold on."
"12848250","12849910"," Freezing my balls off to get put the heat on."
"12850670","12852190"," I turned my heat off this morning. "
"13938800","13947900"," I just want to step in real quick briefly and say that we're seeing some more flow coming in right"
"13947900","13948200"," now."
"13950700","13954500"," Watching lots of spy puts come in for 60p expiring today."
"13956000","13959500"," PayPal puts that small puts position. "
"13959680","13962940"," It's only 40k, but it is for today, 175."
"13964140","13966760"," Parts of the market look like they're selling off."
"13967340","13969300"," They're curling over right now. "
"13970540","13975340"," It's autumn seeing some calls on IWM."
"13976420","13978480"," January 14th, 212c."
"13979060","13980780"," But lots of puts across the board. "
"13981040","13981740"," AMC, Tesla."
"13983820","13984360"," LCID."
"13984740","13985240"," Elsid, right?"
"13985680","13987100"," HYG call our puts. "
"13987980","13988740"," Seeing puts on PD."
"13990320","13994680"," And oddly enough, there are more airlines calls coming in at this time."
"13995120","13998000"," Airlines have been looking like they're teetering on the edge. "
"14000850","14003070"," I'm looking at Hawaiian airlines right now."
"14003070","14004990"," I've been liking this trade for a little while."
"14006070","14009550"," And I can't tell if airlines are bullish or bearish here. "
"14010070","14013230"," Let me know in the chat what you think about airlines if these go up."
"14013770","14016870"," The market's looking like it's kind of on an edge, a knife's edge right now."
"14018070","14019090"," I'll be back in just a few minutes. "
"14061560","14066020"," I'm going to load up Sono for a winky face."
"14067580","14076100"," We'll still keep on, we'll keep on the spy until we see what happens."
"14077420","14082040"," All the flow that I'm seeing coming in on spy is day trader shit. "
"14082460","14084760"," They're buying, they just bought a bunch of 460Ps."
"14085520","14086540"," They expire today."
"14087920","14091580"," Maybe you've got some bulls that'll capitulate into the clothes. "
"14091580","14097460"," I'm assuming that's the hope from day traders is that they think that bulls will lose all hope into"
"14097460","14098180"," Friday clothes."
"14099520","14101580"," I can't tell you if that's going to happen or not."
"14103120","14107880"," Because I am seeing some airline calls coming in, which is kind of bizarre, in the midst of all"
"14107880","14108740"," these spy puts. "
"14111660","14116140"," If you want to see what the target levels are for spy, if we break through right here."
"14116960","14119160"," Someone was asking for a spy trade earlier."
"14119160","14125470"," Your price target, if you bearish is 45631. "
"14127370","14135450"," You have a little bit of resistance above at 457.95. You see this white line here is turning into"
"14135450","14136050"," a yellow line."
"14136810","14140050"," It's showing that some bulls are stepping up to buy that dip."
"14144830","14145870"," We'll get it closer here. "
"14145990","14146970"," We know where our levels are."
"14148310","14153170"," We're going to get in on, I want you to pay attention to the red line."
"14153330","14158030"," You know, if there are orange or red, the thickness of the lines and the buy in south side here"
"14158030","14158490"," where we are. "
"14162170","14163570"," And give me a minute on Sono."
"14163670","14164790"," I'm going to chart it out real quick."
"14274150","14280070"," Take note that currently a spy has a lot of dip buyers stepping in at the moment. "
"14281370","14283550"," Hair indicator is still positive right now."
"14283550","14292650"," And you'll also note that if you look at underlying stocks, they are in a bullish wedge across the"
"14292650","14292910"," board."
"14350640","14351960"," Price targets below. "
"14352240","14354560"," We'll get some more firming up happening down here."
"14358640","14360840"," We've got some ice at 458 to 89."
"14361820","14363620"," Real price targets, those probably 450. "
"14366380","14367260"," Let's take a look."
"14368700","14371200"," A little bit of ice at 458, 79."
"14371820","14374920"," A little bit more ice at 458, 03. "
"14377380","14380500"," Looks like some buyers are stepping up here or disappearing."
"14382000","14383080"," 456, 24."
"14384280","14387300"," If you're bearish right now, I would take the 456Ps. "
"14390280","14391540"," Why are you just staying in the 4?"
"14391740","14392580"," I shouldn't say that."
"14392660","14394980"," If you're going to do zero dates, then stay at the 460."
"14395840","14402340"," As that's where you'll find the most interest without the market makers taking the value. "
"14402340","14406100"," If you take them down at 456, the grinds, they'll just burn them out."
"14408740","14410480"," It is firming up down here as well."
"14477470","14481190"," Also note that there are lots of Apple puts coming in right now. "
"14481250","14482790"," Some Tesla puts as well."
"14483670","14488410"," So if they can't break spy, if they break Apple, that will do the job as well."
"14488410","14490510"," And Apple's sitting on a cliff right now. "
"14490910","14492710"," If anyone's not paying attention to it."
"14493710","14495950"," It's just kind of sitting out there in the middle of nowhere."
"14497070","14501110"," It is out of pretty firm support right now where it's sitting. "
"14501930","14505990"," But if that's support were to break, it would be hell or high water for the market."
"14722720","14724520"," Okay, let's look at Sono real quick."
"14725540","14726820"," Price target is $29. "
"14727480","14729540"," There is some calls out there for $29."
"14730980","14740600"," The one real issue is that you have put structure on February 18th at 25p."
"14742400","14745200"," And that's why we're looking for 25 bucks down here. "
"14745680","14750140"," You have a more interest on the put side of Sono than you do on the call side."
"14751160","14755980"," Now, Sono can be, one good thing about Sono is that it can be moved around."
"14756560","14758700"," It can be easily be manhandled. "
"14760340","14762200"," We did have a bounce down here at support."
"14762780","14767200"," I don't dislike the idea of trading up to 29 bucks."
"14768040","14773280"," The safe trade though would be to see these puts print at some point. "
"14775160","14777740"," Down here at 25 and then buy the ripped 29."
"14779780","14783340"," The expiration on those puts is February 18th, right?"
"14784720","14793480"," They're already in the money at $1.12. The implication would be that we trade up 29 bucks leading"
"14793480","14794180"," into ER."
"14795120","14798160"," And then no matter what, some people are going to take profit at some point. "
"14798340","14805560"," So let's say you see Sono's trade up 29 bucks and then trade down to $25 after ER."
"14806160","14808300"," So this is similar to the city group trade, right?"
"14808660","14812740"," From yesterday, no matter where we trade up, eventually those puts are going to print."
"14813460","14818240"," So the safest trade is probably the $25 trade from February 18th. "
"14818480","14820900"," They probably get them for March 2 rather than just February."
"14822740","14823840"," Buy them for March."
"14823960","14827060"," You just do a put spread to $25. "
"14828040","14830320"," And they probably end up printing at some point."
"14833780","14835360"," Now, chart on Sonos."
"14835920","14837360"," You want to know where I think it's going to be?"
"14838860","14840940"," I was looking at it earlier just a few minutes ago. "
"14846620","14848140"," Where is the Sono chart?"
"14867640","14871360"," I mean, the trade on Sono is probably down at $20 mark, right?"
"14871480","14872160"," You probably know that."
"14873020","14874260"," So we'll look lower."
"14874600","14875820"," Let's see where the banks are at least. "
"14876760","14879100"," Let's look at it from the perspective of if the market's sold."
"14881120","14882500"," Where do the banks want to buy it?"
"14936400","14943820"," So it does look like psychologically $20 would be $20 is going to be a psychological place for"
"14943820","14944360"," Sono."
"14947120","14953960"," I'm assuming that those puts are relying upon Sono trading down to $20 into February. "
"14954280","14955420"," I don't know if it'll get there then."
"14956200","14959660"," The safer, the short trade would be $25 in March."
"14961420","14962900"," Let's see if we can trade it down. "
"14963220","14964640"," Have a nice reaction down here at $20."
"14966000","14967820"," That's still a big move for Sono."
"14967920","14969400"," I realize that that's not really. "
"14971380","14972500"," That's asking a lot."
"14974880","14976100"," We are in ER season."
"14976820","14978340"," It's a little bit of an overlooked stock. "
"14978540","14979880"," It's not like a ton of people are trading it."
"14980160","14982140"," You have more sellers currently than you do have buyers."
"14985810","14987670"," This isn't easily manipulated stock. "
"14993710","14996490"," I would look for a dip into next week."
"14997390","14998890"," Let's see if you can buy that dip at $25."
"14999430","15001150"," A moment those puts are printed. "
"15001870","15004110"," It looks like they were almost printed a couple of days ago."
"15005170","15007890"," You have some bullishness to that aspect of it."
"15010040","15011360"," But they're not going to want to print that anymore. "
"15013180","15015220"," That's a tough one to call for you."
"15015920","15016720"," I will tell you this."
"15016920","15018980"," If you're longing it right now, you know where to sell, right?"
"15019800","15020520"," Selling at $28. "
"15020840","15023540"," If you're in stocks, you want to be able to sell at $29."
"15024720","15027480"," In the after hours, pre-market or whatever."
"15029120","15031020"," And look for this to get out of here already long. "
"15031740","15037380"," If you're looking to take along, I would wait for it to hit $25 before ER."
"15038480","15043360"," If it doesn't hit $25 before ER and you want to take along, I'd wait until we trade down to"
"15043360","15045320"," $20 if we have a market sell off."
"15054780","15059780"," Let's look quickly at Apple and see if this will tell us anything about where we are in the market. "
"15069840","15071380"," That same kind of thing, right?"
"15071520","15072980"," You guys need to be aware of this."
"15073760","15076060"," Well, you guys pay attention to Apple right now."
"15076160","15079120"," You've got light sellers above here at $200, right?"
"15079800","15080960"," You've got $180. "
"15083600","15085440"," $285 is where the real sellers are."
"15085560","15087040"," And they're really firming up, right?"
"15088200","15089720"," You have light support down here at $170."
"15090300","15091620"," Light support down here at $150. "
"15092700","15095640"," One thing you need to be concerned about is it's like musical chairs, right?"
"15096520","15105220"," As the timing takes place, as burning seasons are getting closer and wrapping up, even if you see a"
"15105220","15108960"," quick short squeeze, are you in stock or options?"
"15109300","15111480"," Because if you're in options, you're not going to get paid."
"15113410","15116850"," It'll be an excuse for banks to sell out of their positions, right?"
"15117470","15122730"," Any good ER right now is a good reason for a bank to sell down their position."
"15125170","15131670"," So as the wall is tightening down on Apple here, I know there's this. "
"15132050","15136730"," Sometimes I trade contrarians saying, you know, I take the opposite side of the trade."
"15139850","15142110"," But as the runway goes away, right?"
"15142250","15146870"," As we're burning, eating up runway heading into March, as we're eating up the runway and the"
"15146870","15153090"," tapering, as we're eating up the runway in some rates to be announced at some point, you know that"
"15153090","15158010"," we've got FOMC that's going to be a volatility event."
"15158710","15161590"," You know that OPEX is going to be a volatility event. "
"15161970","15164690"," You know we've got calls rolling off on the 21st."
"15166210","15175970"," That's not to say that these don't create conditions for huge short squeezes,"
"15176510","15178810"," but do you get caught in this as the real question?"
"15180190","15183210"," And that goes for bears to an extent as well."
"15183710","15188770"," If you're not exacting and you're selling the rip, even as a bear, you might want to be waiting. "
"15188770","15193710"," You might miss a trade down, but you might want to be waiting for any day that we spike up"
"15193710","15195410"," to be going short."
"15196190","15198130"," It's like the itch to go short right now."
"15198930","15200350"," It may or may not sell off. "
"15201010","15204550"," If you wanted to guarantee it's going to sell off, it's going to be any time that we squeeze"
"15204550","15205850"," between now and March."
"15208280","15210740"," Because I think those plays are still here too."
"15213280","15217140"," So I think you're looking for every time we rip, that's the short. "
"15217580","15224480"," Anywhere in the middle here is dangerous as a trader, as an investor, and even as a bear."
"15227040","15230600"," So I don't have to say to you on Apple either, but this wall has come down."
"15231580","15233580"," We do have to understand that and respect that. "
"15234500","15243000"," And as this wall comes down farther and farther, it sets up the squeeze, but it also sets up at"
"15243000","15243440"," any moment."
"15243880","15247480"," If you see a wave, just like a cascading, we talked about that."
"15247600","15249280"," The cascade of puts and hedges coming in. "
"15251880","15254140"," We'll sell it the snap of a finger over here."
"15254680","15256480"," That's Apple and any other stock like it."
"15258440","15259220"," Is it pretty good?"
"15259500","15262160"," It's a pretty good bellwether stock to be looking at right now as well. "
"15262780","15264100"," Because you know all the bears are getting in on this."
"15264720","15266340"," They know they know they know."
"15266980","15271540"," There might be a contrarian trade there with the everybody knows it's going down. "
"15276090","15278890"," But it's a hard trade to make."
"15279330","15283830"," You're looking for like the Fed to come out and say we're not tightening."
"15284090","15285650"," We're not raising rates. "
"15288470","15293150"," All the news is stacked against the market at some point as we head into March."
"15295270","15297090"," And I want you to be aware of that if you're a bull."
"15300040","15303560"," That doesn't mean you have to turn full bear, but it does mean if we spike up in here at"
"15303560","15305060"," any point, you see us trade up to 180. "
"15306460","15310840"," You see us trade up to 190, 185, 190, 200, anything like that."
"15311660","15312420"," Let's sell the rip."
"15312760","15314460"," This is a perfect sell the rip setup. "
"15315520","15323590"," If there was one, if there was like I'm going to only take certain trades, these are perfect setups"
"15323590","15327110"," for sell the rips as of right now for where we stand in the market."
"15330810","15333210"," This is your final attempt at long and M2K."
"15339700","15341580"," No worries, we can look at we can look at hood again. "
"15343920","15345320"," Yeah, I'm still waiting in Vasco."
"15347660","15351440"," Yeah, I don't think we see 13 maybe we'll see lower than 1350."
"15351760","15354560"," I'm looking for that 1360 as well on hood. "
"15357830","15358950"," But I'll check it again."
"15359050","15361690"," I checked it this morning, but I'll check me again and I'll check hood again."
"15362330","15363870"," I want you to see this setup here. "
"15364310","15366270"," I want you guys to all understand this setup."
"15367470","15368930"," This is not the bullish setup."
"15369550","15371330"," This doesn't mean though that it can't squeeze. "
"15372290","15372910"," Here's a can."
"15373070","15375590"," This is not the bullish setup."
"15375770","15379230"," This is the, we're going to eventually trade down Apple. "
"15379690","15380530"," The runway's getting shorter."
"15382410","15384350"," Unless some seriously good news comes in."
"15385190","15386050"," You won't see the squeeze. "
"15387130","15393350"," But if you're a bear to in this position, I guess you could just take some bear put spreads and"
"15393350","15394030"," they would probably print."
"15394690","15400490"," If you're looking for best positioning, you know, you know, as a bear positioning matters more"
"15400490","15404830"," sometimes because you're only getting, you're not getting the same print as you do on calls."
"15405790","15409770"," So it's more important for where you position on these trades. "
"15411350","15412630"," And bears are not afraid right now."
"15413970","15415310"," And bulls are actually afraid."
"15416750","15417690"," And for a good reason. "
"15418830","15421230"," Okay, we'll look at hood and then we'll look at Emmy."
"15423210","15426570"," Is it the price didn't change on hood?"
"15426750","15428510"," I thought I looked at hood right at the open."
"15429110","15429930"," So I'm tracking it close. "
"15430130","15431510"," There's a bunch of stocks I'm waiting for."
"15445880","15447960"," And I'll be looking to enter a trade at some point today."
"15448500","15451360"," I just, I don't think I'm ready for a trade until end of day. "
"15452280","15454060"," More than likely I won't take a trade until."
"15457410","15458550"," Find out what's going on."
"15462370","15465030"," Like to the bears just straight up load on. "
"15465950","15470010"," Or is it just retail loading on or we see hedging by end of day?"
"15471170","15479850"," I was really concerned seeing the hedging on the consumer flight stocks."
"15492580","15497620"," Looks like we're down to 1290 on the dip bars."
"15497740","15507450"," We'll check it one more"
"15507450","15507750"," time. "
"15508630","15510090"," This is the line we're watching."
"15511070","15515830"," We want to see where this line stays, where this line is, where it moves to."
"15516570","15518490"," We want to see that big pitch lace move. "
"15519770","15522490"," And we're going to buy what these guys down here, where these guys are."
"15529530","15530670"," And we'll know it when it happens."
"15534150","15536530"," That could be play of the year for some of you out there. "
"15537970","15541830"," If you guys are looking for a play of the year, it's probably watching hood."
"15544470","15545770"," Another one was Viacom."
"15545930","15548110"," We've been talking about that since before Christmas. "
"15552910","15553930"," Another play of the year."
"15557550","15558910"," You could just focus on that."
"15559030","15562610"," You could just not trade and just watch hood until it happens. "
"15563970","15569540"," And you'd make enough money to not have to worry."
"15570140","15572460"," You could just buy the stock and just sell puts on it all year long."
"15576360","15578040"," They're still hovering around this 460. "
"15580400","15583080"," Buyers absorbing sellers, lots of call buyers stepping in."
"15585240","15589800"," But it does come up point in a, it comes to a point where you can't take the contrarian trade"
"15589800","15591500"," where like everybody's loaded up and puts."
"15592380","15595920"," You think I'm going to take the contrarian trade and then all of a sudden the wall of hedges come"
"15595920","15596520"," down. "
"15596980","15599700"," And when that happens, you can get some trouble."
"15609480","15611880"," Have some ice down below at 451."
"15613800","15616620"," Your ultimate by the dip is 402. "
"15619790","15623890"," Some ice above at 568, 613, $7."
"15624210","15626770"," You know that you're looking for a much higher number."
"15627030","15629150"," It's 10 bucks because your first stop. "
"15631680","15637760"," I like having a lot generally speaking, like the ME trade."
"15639160","15640660"," 15 bucks is way out."
"15641280","15642640"," A lot of ice in between. "
"15644160","15646940"," Looks like most sellers are up here around 10 bucks."
"15648100","15649100"," I still like that trade."
"15649560","15650740"," Even if you have to sit on it for a little bit. "
"15651380","15652620"," I like, you know what I like?"
"15652680","15655340"," I like ME a lot better than I like buying SQ right now."
"15658820","15662820"," I like it a lot better than a lot of the stocks I see on the YouTube pumpers telling you"
"15662820","15663080"," to buy."
"15664160","15664860"," To be honest. "
"15669980","15672560"," Would mine sitting on ME over sitting on?"
"15673060","15675260"," I don't know."
"15675400","15676500"," There's a whole list of them."
"15676760","15678240"," Even Peton works out right now. "
"15678940","15681320"," I'd rather take that ME trade than the Peton trade."
"15684980","15686380"," This is a good sign."
"15687100","15695460"," The buyers are moving up from 4.56. Call wall is still not wall, but you know, inter-day. "
"15695600","15696700"," Call wall is still kind of the same."
"15697260","15698080"," It's come down a little bit."
"15698140","15700140"," A little bit of tightness going on in Spy right now. "
"15701240","15702840"," A little decision-making time."
"15703060","15703460"," Maybe coming up."
"15710460","15714440"," I think the key is to watch to see if more hedging comes down today or not. "
"15715160","15719900"," And we're probably going to have to watch it right to 4.15. See what the plan is for Tuesday."
"15724460","15725140"," Boomer stock."
"15725140","15726060"," Hype. "
"15726600","15728320"," Might be time for Alsud puts."
"15734340","15736180"," F-T-C-H golden ticket."
"15737040","15737680"," 30 bucks. "
"15737880","15737940"," Yeah."
"15738020","15744260"," I'm not paying attention right now to what's going on on the flow at the moment."
"15746900","15747860"," I see some. "
"15748940","15749340"," Yeah."
"15749460","15750960"," It's just general risk of version."
"15751640","15753380"," I do see some nice calls. "
"15753900","15758220"," T-218-28C."
"15761180","15762880"," I think that's AT&T, right?"
"15766470","15768170"," I always mix these up."
"15769890","15771130"," Like T and C."
"15771430","15772530"," I always mix them up for some reason. "
"15774830","15776430"," I'm going to move my mic here for a minute."
"15947320","15947880"," Goddamn it."
"15947920","15948540"," I'm muted again. "
"15949540","15951340"," Thank God I'm watching you guys this time."
"15952180","15953760"," Let's talk about this one once more."
"15954920","15955340"," Keep. "
"15955700","15955880"," Okay."
"15956940","15957340"," So."
"15959920","15961080"," You guys can hear me, right?"
"15964120","15965060"," Can you guys hear me?"
"15968500","15969360"," Yeah, I'm getting close. "
"15969480","15970440"," I got my whiskey here with me."
"15971600","15972240"," All right."
"15972240","15974580"," So we had some AT&T calls come in. "
"15982780","15985060"," Can you hear me?"
"15985200","15987900"," Did you guys get my Emmy?"
"15994070","15994870"," All right."
"15994930","15995830"," You guys, did you guys get me?"
"15996090","15997910"," Did you guys get me when I talked about Emmy?"
"16000440","16001280"," Thank you very much."
"16001280","16002020"," I appreciate that. "
"16004860","16007280"," This afternoon we have markets in mayhem joining us."
"16007380","16008980"," We have an VSCO here as well."
"16015020","16017560"," Rally in T equals death for everything. "
"16019400","16021960"," So you guys talked about you guys here."
"16022040","16023140"," We talked about AT&T calls."
"16023140","16025320"," So we had AT&T calls. "
"16025740","16025860"," All right."
"16026000","16026340"," Number one."
"16026980","16030280"," I like the Emmy trade better than I like the SQ trade. "
"16031180","16032480"," I think you guys heard that part."
"16032860","16033420"," Moving on."
"16033960","16034460"," AT&T. "
"16034660","16036100"," A lot of call flow coming in right now."
"16039160","16042140"," What I like about the AT&T trade is that it's not SQ, right?"
"16042360","16043160"," It's not speculative growth."
"16043960","16051180"," I like this setup where the calls are for 28C February 18th. "
"16052400","16054000"," This is the 28 number, right?"
"16054560","16055440"," 2750, 28?"
"16056320","16059300"," Your call wall in AT&T is much far, not sorry."
"16059400","16060680"," I'm showing you guys the wrong part of the chart."
"16063050","16065630"," The call wall on AT&T is actually at 30. "
"16066070","16070570"," So it's not like you're trying to get from 27 to 28."
"16070970","16072710"," You have room to fly above here."
"16073390","16079570"," Get a little bit of ice above at $28 and some more at $28.98. I'd look be a buyer"
"16079570","16081710"," of those calls for February 18th. "
"16081710","16084010"," If we can trade down to $26."
"16085270","16086710"," I'd snap a line at $26."
"16087770","16091610"," If you see the market makers take the juice off those calls. "
"16093250","16096790"," Maybe you'll see the buyer put some more money into them."
"16097650","16100890"," That would give the rocket fuel that you need to get up to that $28 mark."
"16101870","16103610"," You don't have to worry about $30 above. "
"16105270","16106370"," I like this trade a lot."
"16107210","16107830"," The AT&T trade."
"16107830","16118660"," What are"
"16118660","16119840"," we going to talk about here?"
"16121360","16125280"," You guys can see what's going on here. "
"16128160","16135960"," More sellers being consumed on the Spyage."
"16137480","16139780"," Sellers have moved down from above."
"16140680","16148260"," They moved down from $4.64.75 to $4.62.60. They're looking for a reversal here. "
"16153830","16155130"," I finished my lunch."
"16155290","16156370"," I turned my heat on."
"16156430","16157690"," I turned my heat off last night. "
"16158350","16159210"," I was so hot."
"16159350","16160390"," I woke up in the middle night so hot."
"16160870","16162150"," I turned my heat off. "
"16162290","16163010"," I was so pissed off."
"16163290","16164490"," I forgot to turn it on this morning."
"16165170","16168130"," I'm in the middle of this podcast and I'm like, my house is starting to freeze. "
"16169410","16170910"," I went and turned my heat on full blast."
"16172710","16176470"," I got an apple, but I'm not going to eat it online with you guys because I'll sound like a"
"16176470","16177590"," horse or something."
"16179090","16180490"," We'll save the apple for later. "
"16182370","16185790"," In its place, I did get some whiskey."
"16187250","16189230"," It's $1.57. It's late enough."
"16189530","16191690"," I can start having our liquid lunch. "
"16191910","16192310"," It is Friday."
"16194070","16195350"," I still don't have your names."
"16195590","16203350"," I sent my interns to get the names off PayPal Donators so I could give some shout outs today. "
"16204090","16204810"," They're still not here."
"16204810","16207550"," Let me yell at my interns real quick."
"16242820","16243720"," Please, thank you. "
"16244900","16247000"," My interns are my homeschooled kids."
"16248880","16250120"," Of course, I did the yell."
"16250360","16255400"," I'm not the yell, but the deep voice to see if my daughter heard me. "
"16256660","16260800"," I know people say they don't do that, but I do sometimes."
"16264100","16266900"," First, I want to give a shout out to Zio Parco."
"16267700","16268500"," Zio Parco. "
"16269000","16271360"," Z-I-O-P-A-R-C-O."
"16271500","16272380"," Thank you for the tip today."
"16272540","16273000"," Appreciate it. "
"16275650","16276750"," Thank you for supporting the channel."
"16277670","16279370"," It says he's made some money off this channel."
"16279490","16279890"," That's outstanding. "
"16280130","16280750"," I always like to hear that."
"16281710","16285170"," Can you print out the PayPal donations, the names?"
"16285610","16288390"," They don't know who donated this week and I want to thank them."
"16289130","16289750"," Thank you, Lovey. "
"16297770","16299370"," I'll check B.A. right now."
"16302690","16305030"," A virtual intern."
"16305510","16306810"," My interns are my children. "
"16307330","16316350"," I have two daughters that we homeschool or I homeschool or we try to homeschool."
"16317470","16317990"," It's not easy."
"16318950","16319590"," Poor interns. "
"16320130","16321330"," I pay them well though."
"16322010","16324990"," Believe it or not, you got some of your donations I gave to my daughters."
"16325470","16325970"," I did. "
"16326650","16338520"," I think my"
"16338520","16341820"," oldest daughter compiled the list for me the last two weeks ago."
"16342560","16344120"," I think I gave her 20 bucks or something."
"16350570","16351250"," Thanks, Douglas. "
"16351570","16352010"," Appreciate it."
"16353410","16354310"," It's good to be here."
"16354530","16356070"," I want to give a toast to all you guys out there. "
"16356070","16360490"," I have the list coming right now of names that I can't see."
"16360650","16362870"," Some of the names I can see and some of the names I can't see."
"16364270","16368490"," If you donated, yes, I do teach them the market. "
"16370090","16371090"," I have two daughters."
"16371470","16373970"," I want them to be financially independent."
"16374550","16377550"," I want them to never worry in life for themselves. "
"16379590","16381470"," I don't care what they do with their lives."
"16381730","16383509"," I don't care what they are, what they're doing."
"16383509","16390529"," I want them to have the ability to take care of themselves. "
"16397210","16398930"," Expect more of themselves."
"16399270","16401490"," They both are honors students in school."
"16402689","16403610"," They work their butts off. "
"16405810","16407710"," Make you cry, work their butts off."
"16408650","16409470"," They blow me away."
"16411450","16414029"," I think part of it has to do with that we're there. "
"16414189","16418590"," I know some people disagree with that, but when you're there for your children and you have the"
"16418590","16423590"," ability to be there for them, I know that they can't do that, but if you can be there for"
"16423590","16429210"," them, you're like a teacher cares, but does the teacher really care if your kid's learning math or"
"16429210","16432230"," learning English or reading all those kind of things?"
"16433790","16434790"," Thank you, Invesco."
"16436830","16438770"," Invesco, I'll be out there to see."
"16438770","16439590"," I hope you are too. "
"16439810","16442270"," Markets in Mayhem, I hope you're out there having a good time."
"16442750","16447770"," Markets in Mayhem, if you're still in here, if you want to get a glass of water or whiskey."
"16449150","16450270"," Thank you, Jay Cahill. "
"16456990","16462550"," You're able to, you know, it's that one-on-one stuff."
"16462710","16467029"," You guys remember in school, when you get one-on-one time for a teacher, it means the difference in"
"16467029","16467490"," the world, right?"
"16469880","16476300"," It's the difference between are you sure you understand this concept or you don't?"
"16476660","16479860"," And if you don't, do we talk about it?"
"16479900","16480320"," Do we read it?"
"16480560","16482759"," Do we do the problems on paper?"
"16483060","16484520"," Do we live it out in real life?"
"16485720","16488300"," Getting that time is irreplaceable."
"16488500","16490599"," I remember that from my teachers in school too. "
"16491380","16495180"," I went to a Catholic private school and yeah, I learned a lot."
"16495300","16499520"," It was like forced into me, but I never really learned quite like I did when I had those special"
"16499520","16499960"," teachers."
"16500660","16503700"," And I get like that one teacher that spent the time teaching you something. "
"16508000","16509939"," No one selling Roblox for a loss."
"16512080","16513540"," Best trader in human history."
"16514380","16517200"," Yeah, you know, we posted that shit all last summer, right?"
"16517460","16519919"," A bunch of us on Twitter did. "
"16520279","16523060"," You know, these guys never lose their trades ever."
"16524800","16526360"," And I did hear it great."
"16527040","16527619"," I forget who it was. "
"16527779","16531040"," The guy that has the, I forget his name, but there's a guy on Twitter."
"16532240","16533220"," Everybody likes him."
"16533279","16533720"," He's a great trader. "
"16534000","16536119"," He makes great comments, great posts."
"16536700","16540279"," He uses the dude as his profile picture."
"16541919","16544020"," He made a point that I really liked. "
"16544099","16544840"," I think he was him."
"16544980","16549619"," He said, let them trade whatever they want in the Senate."
"16549939","16551660"," All politicians, let them trade whatever they want. "
"16554020","16560099"," But force them to make their trades public the same day within like an hour."
"16560099","16561680"," And you just automate it."
"16562800","16566099"," There's like an automated posting that goes straight to a website. "
"16567160","16572439"," And if Nancy Pelosi buys Roblox, you know, at 10 a.m. you know, by like 11, 12 o'clock."
"16572939","16574880"," And it's for everybody has access to it."
"16575160","16581099"," So it's not like any hedge funds getting any sooner than you are unless they make an office and tie"
"16581099","16587270"," in a internet connection closer than everybody else. "
"16587450","16589029"," They used to do that with trading with the stock market."
"16590110","16594590"," But if you just made it public, public knowledge right away, then fine."
"16594790","16595369"," I'm fine with that. "
"16597439","16597800"," Exactly."
"16598180","16599020"," Live trade with members."
"16604200","16605240"," Big Lebowski, man. "
"16605380","16605860"," I love that movie."
"16608259","16610119"," You're on Schweitzer this weekend right on."
"16610619","16611560"," I'm skiing this weekend. "
"16611720","16613160"," I hope you guys are all able to get out this weekend."
"16614000","16615640"," Spend some time with family friends or even alone."
"16615919","16616599"," Just get out of the house. "
"16619119","16620140"," Yeah, the Pelosi discord."
"16620800","16621580"," That's the thing, man."
"16621700","16623759"," It's like there's BA calls coming in right now. "
"16623759","16625180"," So your polite wife's boyfriend."
"16625640","16626500"," Here you go, brother."
"16628360","16631240"," Just smashing through levels up here on BA. "
"16631779","16633419"," Guys are just killing it today."
"16635619","16641640"," We're talking about BA earlier that the bullish context of this trade is that the banks are not out"
"16641640","16642419"," of BA yet."
"16643279","16645220"," Like let's say they're wrapping up all their trades. "
"16645779","16647560"," They still haven't gotten paid for BA."
"16648140","16650759"," So they want it at a set price before we saw the market."
"16661650","16662710"," Yeah, follow them both. "
"16663070","16667349"," You guys, if you guys don't follow these guys, follow markets in mayhem, follow investment."
"16667730","16668710"," These guys know how to trade."
"16668910","16671369"," These guys have a whole ton of stuff going on. "
"16673070","16673910"," So here we go."
"16674230","16678169"," We're going to do two toasts today if I can ever get those other names in here, like Jake's name."
"16679390","16683730"," We'll do another toast, but for right now, hope you guys all have some food in front of you. "
"16684349","16685450"," Water in front of you."
"16685849","16687650"," Coffee, espresso, whatever you drink."
"16688990","16689369"," Whiskey. "
"16690009","16693950"," If you're in the Netherlands or Sweden and you get all those fine drugs."
"16695610","16696509"," If you're in Canada."
"16698630","16700189"," I hope you're shit faced. "
"16700430","16702290"," I bet all the English people are shit faced currently."
"16702810","16703910"," It doesn't matter what time of day it is."
"16704470","16705710"," So here's a toast to all of you as traders. "
"16706710","16707770"," It's the chairs to retail."
"16708410","16709210"," Chairs to 2021."
"16710050","16712169"," Chairs to a great year ahead of us. "
"16712630","16713650"," No matter where the market goes."
"16714490","16715730"," And thank you for all of your support."
"16716349","16716890"," 100%. "
"16717790","16719710"," Retail traders have to stick together period."
"16724740","16725099"," Whoo."
"16729140","16729240"," Whoo. "
"16733349","16734770"," Spin up a dooby."

"16776850","16782570"," I think it's the, not the double bourbon, but it's called a, it's whatever their big bourbon is"
"16782570","16782990"," that they have. "
"16783270","16783830"," Can't fire bourbon."
"16786130","16787370"," Wow, my nipples are hard."
"16788050","16788150"," Whoo. "
"16789050","16790570"," Let's talk about bringing the fire on."

"17093210","17095510"," Still seeing a lot of airline calls."
"17095850","17098230"," Like DAL has lots of call flow right now."
"17100090","17102590"," To February 2nd, 43C. "
"17103010","17104450"," Still more BA calls."
"17104930","17106150"," United Airlines calls."
"17106730","17108690"," Check out Hawaiian Airlines too. "
"17109470","17111570"," They've been kind of under the covers, right?"
"17111690","17113290"," No one's talking about Hawaiian Airlines."
"17116740","17118460"," Check out some of the smaller carriers."
"17120560","17128000"," I like that Hawaiian air has been trading up since December 1st. "
"17128140","17128880"," It's right on support."
"17130300","17133720"," Now I get the hiccups."
"17136580","17142820"," You know that ticker that Russia ticker from the small. "
"17143640","17146200"," It's running up ripping all day long today."
"17146800","17149940"," You see the other one that I was like, fuck that ain't trading Russian socks."
"17151000","17152580"," Been printing all morning. "
"17160600","17163540"," And PDD, the other one that we were like, nope, we're not trading China."
"17164140","17165520"," It's been trading down all day long."
"17169180","17170700"," So I guess a mixed bag on that stuff. "
"17172480","17177800"," And we talked about XRT taking the puts on XRT this morning."
"17178260","17180100"," And it's been trading down all day long."
"17180100","17187810"," With the fingerprint on XRT, Kroger has not yet given up. "
"17189950","17195230"," Although it is starting to, you know, look like it might, it looks like it might rip a little bit."
"17196090","17199010"," The other short, the first short was XRT."
"17199550","17205870"," It looks prime to drop Kroger has not quite dropped yet. "
"17207150","17209350"," But there is a large hedge on Kroger."
"17209350","17224850"," I'm going"
"17224850","17227750"," to look real quick at Airbnb into the clothes here."
"17229630","17239570"," Delta Airlines, DAL, February 4th, 43C, high algo score, loads of DAL calls coming in"
"17239570","17240030"," right now. "
"17240730","17250170"," One, two, three, four, so look up DSCA, D-I-S-C-A, lots of calls coming in."
"17250170","17259810"," April 14th, 37.5 and 42.5, big monies on 37.5 for DSCA,"
"17262480","17264280"," BA still has calls coming in."
"17264840","17266020"," You could trade jets too. "
"17266780","17274060"," Let's take a look at jets real quick and I guess a couple of questions, right?"
"17274260","17277820"," We got markets and mayhem is here and Vescu is here."
"17278120","17284840"," Let's ask those guys, are you guys short over the weekend, flat over the weekend or long over the"
"17284840","17290700"," weekend and if you're short long or flat, if you're short or long, are you taking some kind of a"
"17290700","17293880"," spread or are you taking naked options?"
"17296240","17305640"," Also more T calls coming in right now, January 14th, 26.5, so we're seeing follow through on T"
"17305640","17314540"," calls and hey, markets and mayhem, one other thing for you, I think I can"

"17321100","17330970"," maybe, you guys want to get in Vescu and"
"17330970","17343460"," markets and mayhem on here on a channel, I can probably do that yesterday,"
"17343740","17345160"," I couldn't but I think I can today."
"17355100","17358360"," I like having those guys live, I don't know if I can but I can try. "
"17359820","17373930"," Desktop audio, let me see what this does, all right,"
"17374290","17381530"," give me a second here, what I'll do is, let me see, what I'm gonna do, oh yeah, look at"

"17728390","17735530"," speaker, yes, you are now a speaker, I figured it out, I've had some headphones on from my end so"
"17735530","17745510"," I can listen in, sure, I will be right back, so I will try"
"17745510","17755440"," to keep y'all entertained in Jim's brief absence here, all right, so I think markets and"
"17755440","17763340"," mayhem can hear me, but I can't hear marks and mayhem, oh no, it's not good, let me get some,"
"17763340","17775890"," let me get some headphones for, I need a sound monitor, okay, one"
"17778420","17785000"," second, so getting, I think if I can get in Vesqua, I have,"

"17853700","17859920"," you, so we are waiting for Jim to get on, I'm gonna try to just start talking a little bit"
"17859920","17864100"," about what I'm seeing on my screen, kind of like a recap of what's going on, so I hope it"
"17864100","17885100"," helps y'all, index"
"17885100","17891460"," today, I kind of feel like if handbrake above 5560, we could confirm intradable flag and brake"
"17891460","17895500"," higher, but if it can't, you know, we could still get faded down and retest on these levels of"
"17895500","17900260"," grinding, it kind of seems like it's starting to happen a little bit here, and I apologize for my"
"17900260","17904740"," voice, I swallowed something and it went down the wrong pipe yesterday, so I'm still a little iffy"
"17904740","17911180"," sometimes, in terms of sectors, this is a day where there's not much green participation, right,"
"17911300","17919880"," you've got oil, gas, semiconductors, hacks, and regional banking got a bid, and then that's really"
"17919880","17926840"," it, in terms of factors, value, small cap value is down the lease, mid cap growth is down the most,"
"17927400","17932420"," so there's a little bit of risk off, but it's not strong because you still have, you know, high"
"17932420","17938980"," beta is still outperforming low volatility large cap, and what that means is there's, you know,"
"17939060","17945320"," high beta large caps are down less than low volatility large caps, which just shows there's a risk"
"17945320","17950620"," appetite, people aren't rushing into defense, still a bid in financials and energy, and you know,"
"17950720","17954380"," you still see a little bit of a bid in some of the other areas of the market, it's not"
"17954380","17955660"," just a complete sell off."
"17958100","18038240"," In the growth proxies, can"
"18038240","18041820"," you hear me markets?"
"18045500","18051200"," Well, you know what the problem is, is that I look from logging in on another computer, kicks me"
"18051200","18051740"," off here."
"18052920","18055340"," I'm going to kick you back on over here, okay?"
"18056440","18079900"," All right, all"
"18079900","18086520"," right, let's see if markets of mayhem is back on again on this channel, kind of, sorry, Mark, it's"
"18086520","18086700"," good. "
"18088020","18090180"," Testing, testing, can you all hear me now?"
"18101720","18112840"," Testing, testing, I"
"18112840","18114820"," can hear myself, so it sounds like I'm through."
"18119580","18129560"," All right, I am back, and you can hear me"
"18129560","18129840"," okay?"
"18188900","18194140"," Yeah, yeah, I don't, I just wanted to make sure Jim can you can hear me."
"18194240","18197240"," Okay, I'll kind of start going through my market recap again a little bit. "
"18198340","18201880"," So, Brett is not amazing, as you can imagine."
"18202160","18206300"," So I'm not muted right now, but I don't have a, sorry to interrupt, I don't know where you guys"
"18206300","18206720"," are talking."
"18207600","18208500"," Oh, no, no, no. "
"18208600","18212780"," I have a monitor set up to listen into markets in mayhem."
"18213880","18216400"," It's, it's wonky right now how it's, how it's set up."
"18216460","18222660"," It's not quite ready for me to have a, a speaker on the, and this setup right here, but I"
"18222660","18224740"," will have that this week very soon. "
"18227400","18231140"," So, there's a possible, I hope I'm interrupting, I apologize."
"18231900","18236180"," When markets of mayhem is done, if somebody could just text inside the chat box."
"18238630","18240310"," All right, so I'll pick it up from here. "
"18240510","18242190"," So, and we'll sort that out."
"18242290","18243750"," We'll, we'll get that going."
"18244290","18250590"," But yeah, so Brett, this is kind of halitosis like the, the New York Stock Exchange has nine"
"18250590","18252270"," advanced 24-decliners. "
"18252910","18254170"," So, pretty nasty there up volume."
"18254490","18257010"," Just shy of a billion, down volume, just shy of two billion."
"18257710","18259870"," So that's two to one down on volume two. "
"18260530","18263170"," That's pretty widespread selling on the New York Stock Exchange."
"18263870","18265830"," Now, it's actually a little better, but it's still pretty terrible."
"18266250","18273410"," 15 advances to 20, I'm sorry, to 33-decliners up volume 1.3 billion, down volume 1.7 billion. "
"18273670","18275870"," So, pretty nasty internals across the board."
"18276050","18279930"," But we are, you know, if you think those are bad, you should see where we were at the lows"
"18279930","18280370"," of the day."
"18280550","18281570"," It was quite a bit worse. "
"18282470","18286630"," I don't know what I cut off in particular on my sector stuff, but I think you guys probably heard"
"18286630","18290250"," that oil and gas, semis, tech, regional banking has a bid."
"18291390","18296450"," So, you know, those are, those are where we're seeing money coming in on the S&P 500 level,"
"18296450","18297050"," basically."
"18297730","18299890"," Small caps, a little bit more of a mixed bag. "
"18301190","18305470"," You do still see demand for high-grade debt and junk debt."
"18305870","18309170"," And, you know, a lot of people are saying, and I'm just going to put this out there as a"
"18309170","18309410"," thought."
"18309730","18311310"," It's not a car on the market. "
"18311490","18313330"," It's more just an observation."
"18314350","18319490"," But we've got a really strong bid that continues in some of these sectors, right?"
"18319790","18323730"," And a lot of this stuff is high beta, like these Energy's financials, industrials, materials."
"18324210","18328570"," That's been the theme of late 2021 and early 2022. "
"18329010","18332090"," And it doesn't show any really signs of, of lighting up in a meaningful way."
"18332190","18336790"," You see, you know, crude oil is making new highs for the year."
"18337070","18341110"," And it's, looks like it's going to retest last year's highs in October, November. "
"18342090","18345770"," So you've got, you do have a lot of different kind of consequences happening."
"18345770","18348870"," They're saying, no, it's, it's not that this is the end of the bull market."
"18349390","18350890"," At least that's what I'm seeing. "
"18351150","18355470"," It's saying more that we're going the late cycle, that later cycle plays are more in favor."
"18356530","18362550"," And I think that's important to consider, because, you know, you do have some bid in the"
"18362550","18367310"," defensive's, but the debate that you have in utilities today is actually, it's, they're getting"
"18367310","18367970"," sold down."
"18368650","18373030"," Well, you actually have a 1.73% gain in oil and gas. "
"18373550","18378510"," So that's not telling us that market participants, the institution saying, Oh God, you know, we're"
"18378510","18379470"," going to a new bear market."
"18379470","18381650"," Fed's going to overshoot, economy's going to tank."
"18382230","18387750"," What they're saying is, you know, the Fed's policy is pulling that late cycle, kind of like"
"18387750","18395050"," cyclical part of the economic cycle forward further, but it's solidifying that yes, indeed, you"
"18395050","18399610"," know, real rates are probably going to go positive, that the old curve is probably going to"
"18399610","18402610"," steepen, even if it does so in a bearish way, like it has recently. "
"18403450","18408130"," And you're going to see funding costs increase, but you know, they're doing that because ostensibly"
"18408130","18412090"," interest rates going higher is supposed to be a vote on a stronger economy, right?"
"18412770","18415950"," We did get some interesting data that kind of contradicts that view, though, today, didn't we?"
"18416570","18418630"," We got that horrible retail sales."
"18418870","18420250"," We got nasty consumer sentiment."
"18420810","18425250"," We got a lot of kind of indicators showing that, you know, the consumer, which is two thirds of the"
"18425250","18426630"," economy, really isn't participating. "
"18427090","18432210"," And if you follow me on Twitter, you know, one of my themes for late 2021 was that the consumer"
"18432210","18438550"," had kind of peak in terms of their economic participation, at least, you know, for this cycle,"
"18438830","18443270"," unless something meaningfully changes with Fed and consumer savings rates and the amount of debt"
"18443270","18448030"," that the bottom 60% are taking on and sort of that the cost of things that they're buying probably"
"18448030","18449210"," not going to be so great."
"18449210","18451710"," And if you look at that retail sales number, you factor for inflation."
"18452390","18453970"," Real retail sales were down a lot more. "
"18454370","18455630"," So I just want to put that out there too."
"18456290","18457410"," Will oil correct?"
"18458010","18458830"," You know, it could."
"18459430","18463550"," If we do see a meaningful slowdown in the economy, then yeah, absolutely. "
"18463890","18464590"," You could see oil correct."
"18464790","18469710"," One of the things that's helping oil run is the lack of elasticity and supply, but you are seeing"
"18469710","18471890"," more supply coming on at these levels."
"18472490","18475970"," So, you know, one thing in a commodity complex, a lot of traders like to say is the cure for"
"18475970","18482870"," high prices, high prices, because once prices go high enough, you have more elasticity and supply. "
"18483230","18484150"," You've got more exploration."
"18484490","18485830"," You've got more resources being tapped."
"18486290","18487450"," You've got more rigs being deployed. "
"18488370","18491390"," And so that tends to increase the amount of supply that's out there."
"18491930","18498010"," So I think that, you know, that's that's kind of what you're seeing at this point above 80s."
"18498110","18500010"," There's going to be a lot more activity in the oil path. "
"18500490","18501910"," And that should add to supply."
"18502310","18508870"," Now my thesis, and of course, I can be horribly wrong about anything I say, but my thesis for 2022"
"18508870","18516050"," is one of slowing economy, tightening liquidity, and a slowing velocity of inflation."
"18516850","18520250"," I do not mean that prices are going down on consumer goods. "
"18520890","18524110"," I mean the rate at which they are going up will slow."
"18524870","18527750"," And that's an important distinction because these things are not the same, right?"
"18527910","18532250"," You know, the Fed said transitory, what they really meant is that the rate at which prices are"
"18532250","18534870"," going up won't always be going up that fast."
"18535010","18536030"," That's really what they meant. "
"18536410","18541410"," I know it's it's not clear and it's pretty bizarre Fed speak, but but definitely keep that in mind,"
"18541570","18541670"," guys."
"18542390","18548710"," So in terms of where do we go from here, you know, we got some pretty soft macro, you know,"
"18548710","18553110"," not just this, but some of the some of the manufacturing data was pretty soft."
"18553370","18555910"," We see the Atlanta Fed downwardly revising GDP. "
"18556830","18562030"," So we do see some indicators that, you know, 2022's economic trajectory is not very strong."
"18562690","18567070"," And you already see China rolling over and their central bank becoming more accommodative."
"18567070","18572730"," And they were some of the first, you know, China got the COVID sickness, not only in their"
"18572730","18575770"," population, but in their markets and their economy first. "
"18576370","18578310"," So their central bank was the first to ease."
"18578430","18579530"," They're also the first to tighten."
"18579730","18584290"," Now they're going back to easing and they weren't tight for that long, maybe less than a year. "
"18584950","18588870"," I don't know that the other central banks are even to have that long play around with the idea of"
"18588870","18589070"," tightening."
"18589250","18591550"," They kind of lost some of their window of opportunity."
"18591810","18593490"," So I'm going to break it down in this way. "
"18593890","18595410"," And I'm not saying it's going to happen this way."
"18595410","18597390"," I'm just saying these are the risks that the Fed is running."
"18598270","18602650"," The Fed does not have any levers it can pull to slow inflation other than reducing demand. "
"18603250","18607250"," They can they can slow down the economy's growth by raising the cost of capital."
"18607750","18612130"," They can slow down the economy's growth by reducing the price of assets."
"18612610","18614170"," It slows down business activity. "
"18614690","18617010"," It reduces economic activity as a result."
"18617270","18618210"," There's a buffer impact."
"18618490","18623350"," So these policy changes take six to 18 months to take effect, right?"
"18624070","18629530"," So the problem is that even though the Fed probably doesn't want to main goal the market or the"
"18629530","18635550"," economy, they are politically being pressured by both the Republicans and the Democrats do just"
"18635550","18640650"," that because the legislation and the president apparently think that the Fed is solely responsible"
"18640650","18641290"," for inflation. "
"18642130","18643570"," Now that's complete nonsense."
"18643990","18644610"," Do they play a role?"
"18644810","18645030"," Absolutely."
"18645310","18648870"," I mean, look at the price of housing and the Fed's buying mortgage back securities and artificially"
"18648870","18653990"," dropping those rates and causing a lot of people to buy too much house and ostensibly at too cheap"
"18653990","18655610"," of a price for the risk they present. "
"18656190","18656950"," So that's an issue."
"18657350","18658910"," But is that the whole inflation issue?"
"18659090","18659190"," No."
"18659410","18663730"," I mean, there's definitely more demand coming online from fiscal policy. "
"18664390","18669310"," You know, these sort of helicopter drops of money we had during COVID combined with a lot of just"
"18669310","18672010"," different supply chain congestion, right?"
"18672610","18675930"," And so when you factor that and the Fed, some of the Fed speakers including Powell have actually"
"18675930","18676770"," been honest about this."
"18676790","18681370"," They said the Fed can't fight supply chain inflation that there's very little they can do that they"
"18681370","18684190"," have some tools but those tools aren't really meant for that."
"18684670","18687010"," So you've got to kind of take that into context. "
"18687170","18693890"," And then the other side of it, you have a debt super cycle that's over 40 years old is increasingly"
"18693890","18694850"," leveraged in fragile."
"18695450","18698450"," There's over 150 trillion dollars of global debt that keys off the 10-year note."
"18698830","18701430"," You've got 30 trillion dollars of US government debt. "
"18701650","18705290"," If you price it in a two-year 10-year, the US government with 30 trillion dollars of debt is"
"18705290","18709070"," paying 600 billion dollars a year in interest."
"18709650","18710990"," That's not even the principle on that debt."
"18711730","18714450"," The DOD budget being 740 billion dollars in 2021. "
"18715410","18720090"," If you go to a 3% on a normalized rate for US debt, that's 900 billion dollars a year."
"18720190","18721430"," That's forced austerity territory."
"18721930","18723610"," So how far can the Fed really normalize?"
"18723670","18726610"," There's really the question because everything is much more leveraged. "
"18727310","18732830"," Debtors are reliant ever more on increasingly accommodated policy because they can't tolerate"
"18732830","18733610"," higher interest rates."
"18733830","18739110"," But the amount of debt that keys off the 10-year, you start going up 10-20 bips on a"
"18739110","18741530"," 10-year, it actually costs billions of dollars of losses."
"18741790","18743990"," And that gets magnified as those rates get higher. "
"18744250","18748750"," Higher rates in these lower prices, all these tools that are bound to the movement of that 10-year."
"18749250","18750050"," So that's a big deal."
"18750490","18754550"," So the Fed's caught between a rock and a hard place because they can't over tighten. "
"18754950","18758290"," And even if they do, it's not going to have the kind of impact that they're being pressured to"
"18758290","18758570"," create."
"18759370","18764170"," And on the other hand, they have to be cognizant of that debt super cycle because if a deflationary"
"18764170","18767610"," credit collapse happens and they can't get ahead of it, it's kind of game over."
"18767730","18769610"," I mean, that's going to be a very long brutal recession. "
"18770210","18772990"," And it's going to be very difficult for central banks to rebuild the sentiment game."
"18773210","18775430"," I mean, half of it is the narrative and rebuilding sentiment."
"18775430","18778390"," And the other half is the delayed impact of policy kicking in. "
"18779010","18786750"," So just want to kind of help you guys have a heads up because this is a very interesting juncture."
"18786870","18788710"," There's never been a time in human history like this."
"18788750","18790510"," And in terms of do they need to normalize though?"
"18790990","18793570"," Yeah, I mean, they need to give the appearance of normalize. "
"18793670","18796490"," And look at the trajectory of Fed funds rate over the last 40 years."
"18797330","18800310"," Like basically it's lower highs and lower lows, right?"
"18800650","18804570"," Look at the trajectory of the 10 year, 20 year, 30 year yield over the last 40 years."
"18804990","18806670"," It's basically lower highs and lower lows. "
"18806910","18809810"," So you have this 40 year cycle of ever decreasing costs of funding."
"18810250","18811790"," You can't just reverse that all of a sudden."
"18815640","18824060"," If you do, there's going to be a very violent awakening in credit markets that kind of usurps the"
"18824060","18824680"," global economy. "
"18825200","18830500"," So I would just say that at this point, you know, the UK House of Lords, they did a study"
"18830500","18831900"," on global central bank policy."
"18832620","18837700"," And what they found was that in the entirety of QE's known existence, which is really in modern"
"18837700","18846080"," times, really 21st century tool, yes, that no central bank had ever fully normalized their policy"
"18846080","18848180"," after engaging in QE, not one."
"18848600","18852340"," And so the Fed is kind of saying, we're going to try this again, but no central bank has ever"
"18852340","18853720"," done this and we don't really know what we're doing. "
"18853980","18856420"," So you got to look at this in a very nuanced view."
"18856540","18859220"," There's no guarantees as to what the Fed is going to do."
"18859320","18860620"," On the one hand, they tend to overshoot. "
"18861020","18863720"," On the other hand, if they do, it's going to have profound consequences."
"18864660","18865760"," Jim, are you able to hear me now?"
"18871530","18873130"," So that's kind of my stick."
"18873390","18877110"," I mean, I think we need to continue to monitor econometric data. "
"18877450","18880410"," We need to see how that might influence Fed policy."
"18881170","18885610"," And we need to be cognizant that this is a fluid situation that nothing is set in stone."
"18886110","18892430"," And so far as the rate hike cycle, their balance sheet run off, and to some degree, how"
"18892430","18894010"," aggressively they taper. "
"18894630","18899250"," Because if the economy does material, they're going to have to take a U-turn or all the work they"
"18899250","18901310"," did and all this policy is going to completely unravel."
"18901650","18902790"," And yes, addiction is hard to break."
"18902930","18903790"," This is a liquidity bubble. "
"18904170","18904750"," Let's be clear."
"18904950","18906910"," This is not a natural bull market."
"18907370","18908430"," This is a liquidity bubble. "
"18908610","18910810"," And it has been since at least the great financial crisis."
"18910990","18914630"," You had evidence of that going into the dot-com bus as well, but that was a liquidity bubble."
"18914790","18915730"," But this is absolutely profound. "
"18916150","18920390"," I mean, you're talking about tens of trillions of dollars of central bank liquidity, flooding the"
"18920390","18923730"," system in early 2020 and April 2020."
"18924230","18925570"," There's never anything like that."
"18925650","18928710"," Every time there's ever been a recession, they come in slowly. "
"18929070","18931330"," A little rate cut here, a little rate cut there."
"18932070","18934910"," We got to QE in the great financial crisis because how extreme it was."
"18935050","18940630"," This time they just unleashed 12, 14 trillion dollars of global central bank liquidity. "
"18941650","18943470"," And there's really never been anything like that."
"18943590","18950190"," And so when that velocity of liquidity was spiking in early 2020 through very early 2021,"
"18950610","18951490"," everything had a bid."
"18951670","18956130"," If you put a floaty toy in a pool and you start filling that pool with water and the water"
"18956130","18960690"," is that liquidity, that floaty toy is going up because all that liquidity is pushing it up. "
"18960810","18963290"," It's sort of like all these different stocks floating up."
"18963850","18967990"," Well, when you start to taper, what you're doing is you're cutting off the bigot to the pool."
"18968170","18969250"," So it's not rising as fast. "
"18969850","18971070"," And the market can tolerate that."
"18971210","18977090"," There's been plenty of times when you see tapering happen, that it doesn't have a real negative"
"18977090","18980590"," impact on equities that they're able to make new all-time highs after some turbulence."
"18981070","18987810"," But what really scares the market is aggressive rate hikes and balance sheet runoff because that"
"18987810","18989890"," materially tightens liquidity conditions. "
"18990290","18991670"," So at that point, you're draining the pool."
"18992050","18994030"," Now the floaty toy is going back down to the bottom."
"18994390","18997610"," That's sort of a symbol of all these different risk asset prices. "
"18998550","19003150"," So that's one of the things that you really got to pay attention to as a sort of dynamic to"
"19003150","19003270"," this."
"19003490","19009670"," This was not a liquidity-driven bull market with the economy being the primary driver."
"19009910","19013350"," This is a liquidity-driven bull market with liquidity being the primary driver. "
"19013810","19017690"," The economy is so much in the backseat that when you get bad data, it's actually good for the"
"19017690","19018030"," market."
"19018800","19020610"," You know, how perverse is that?"
"19021250","19024650"," Typically bad data is good for the market because the market is saying this is going to give the"
"19024650","19026690"," Fed pause on tightening."
"19027370","19033470"," So we've gotten to the situation where the markets so far detached from economic data that the"
"19033470","19039030"," primary feedback loops that kind of push prices higher are things like the abundance of liquidity,"
"19039630","19042570"," the availability of funding and cheap rates. "
"19043190","19048910"," And then a lot of fixed income and bonds basically being return free risk."
"19049030","19051130"," You've got negative real yields."
"19051230","19052130"," So you're paying the whole debt. "
"19052370","19053090"," So why would you do that?"
"19053350","19055050"," So it pushes risk further up the curve."
"19055770","19056910"," Well, now you have all that reversing."
"19057590","19060630"," Now you have the real yields starting to go closer to positive territory. "
"19061410","19064550"," And you have liquidity starting to add out of the system."
"19065070","19066450"," And so it's inverting some of that."
"19066610","19068530"," So that's what the market is starting to price in. "
"19068630","19069930"," That's why there's some more volatility."
"19070810","19075430"," And if the Fed does actually do quantitative tightening, that is the end of the bull market."
"19075610","19078390"," Like if they actually do it and they go all the way through, I don't mean if they pause and"
"19078390","19078570"," reverse. "
"19079170","19082350"," I mean, if they actually really sell down their balance sheet, that will end the bull market."
"19082530","19084670"," I don't think they're going to do it because I don't think they'll be able to do it."
"19084990","19086190"," But I could be totally wrong. "
"19086230","19086910"," We'll see what happens."
"19087110","19088370"," So that's kind of my recap."
"19088650","19089430"," I want to hand it back to Jim. "
"19089570","19093110"," I didn't mean to hijack his YouTube just wanted to try to give you all a sense of what I"
"19093110","19093250"," think."
"19093450","19094150"," Yeah, I can hear you."
"19094370","19094790"," I can hear you. "
"19094910","19095270"," Can you hear me?"
"19097170","19097570"," Okay."
"19098670","19099070"," Oh, good."
"19172080","19181990"," Yeah, I mean, I agree in a sense that like when we're analyzing how things are"
"19181990","19184750"," moving, we're seeing a market that's going late cycle. "
"19185010","19186150"," There's still a bid for high beta."
"19186150","19188930"," There's still a healthy appetite for risk in certain sectors."
"19189750","19196150"," I believe that it's one of the one of the scenarios I assign a higher probability to is that the"
"19196150","19198610"," Fed can't do anything close to what they've said. "
"19198790","19200210"," And there's a reason for that too."
"19200750","19204970"," And one of the things that we've talked about my friend and that I talk about on Twitter is that"
"19204970","19210550"," like half the policy objectives that the Federal Reserve has are completed through jaw boning."
"19210830","19211930"," They just talk about it. "
"19211990","19213810"," They float trial balloons through the Wall Street Journal."
"19214050","19215990"," They get a bunch of speakers out there with various point of views."
"19216330","19220990"," And then they look at how the market reacts and they look at how the commentary is about it from"
"19220990","19221490"," different banks. "
"19221710","19223730"," And then they kind of decide how they're going to shape their policy."
"19223730","19227850"," And it's all this kind of like, it's like a process that's very fluid."
"19228210","19232010"," So when they say with certainty, anything's going to happen, you already know they're they're being"
"19232010","19232610"," insincere. "
"19325700","19332180"," Hey, Jim, I'm hearing from people in the YouTube that they are not able to hear your mic."
"19334670","19335350"," It does."
"19335530","19337170"," I wish that they made this stuff easier. "
"19337310","19341450"," It's not like podcasting and collaborative conferencing is like a new thing."
"19341450","19342110"," We're in 2022."
"19342530","19344210"," There should just be a button you hit. "
"19344310","19345790"," And it's like broadcast to everyone."
"19346170","19347090"," All the audio on my computer."
"19347270","19348890"," This is like, this should be the simple technology. "
"19348930","19349730"," What the fuck?"
"19349910","19350230"," Sorry."
"19350530","19351030"," Excuse me."
"19351170","19353530"," What the heck is wrong with the technology?"
"19353790","19354530"," They can't do this. "
"19357660","19358080"," Okay."
"19360970","19368510"," All right, guys, thank you for your patience."
"19369010","19369850"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"19370910","19372510"," Yeah, thanks everyone for your patience."
"19372650","19373230"," We'll get it sorted."
"19373750","19375030"," Jim's got this under control. "
"19375270","19378710"," We just, you know, we're giving technology a hard time because technology deserves to have a hard"
"19378710","19378910"," time."
"19379570","19384590"," But, you know, ultimately, this is this is a market where, you know, it is essentially playing"
"19384590","19385530"," chicken with the fed."
"19385670","19389610"," They say don't fight the fed, but then you got to also be able to to know well, is the"
"19389610","19390330"," fed being honest?"
"19390570","19392910"," Are they telling us what's actually going to happen?"
"19393490","19397450"," Or are they just kind of testing the reaction of the market for some of the things that we're"
"19397450","19398330"," talking about, right?"
"19399030","19400370"," And I think that that's one of the things. "
"19400530","19401710"," Yeah, OBS is a good system."
"19401770","19403870"," That's certainly something that that we should look into."
"19404010","19404650"," That's a good point. "
"19405210","19409270"," And there's other ways that we could probably broadcast this to you."
"19410050","19416250"," So, so look, ultimately, we got to see what price and time tell us."
"19416510","19420670"," That's really the, the abstractor of truth, right?"
"19421510","19428710"," Price and time, on charts, technicals, but ultimately how patterns resolve, the market's telling"
"19428710","19434930"," us, you know, with the fractal geometry of price and time, what is right and what is wrong?"
"19436750","19440310"," And that's especially true on a really big index like the S&P. "
"19440870","19445650"," Like an individual stocks, you can have enough noise that it distorts a chart and you might not be"
"19445650","19446610"," able to get the same kind of signals."
"19446910","19453390"," But when you start talking about an index is as deep and as liquid as the S&P, that could"
"19453390","19456730"," be a completely, you know, that's going to be a completely valid signal most of the time."
"19457370","19459630"," So, you know, you can look at it a variety of ways. "
"19459810","19463350"," You can look at moving averages, you can look at momentum oscillators, you can look at things like"
"19463350","19464170"," itchimoko cloud."
"19464470","19468750"," That's what I like to use along with full stochastics and volume shells."
"19469450","19473570"," But ultimately, you know, right now, the S&P is still in an uptrend. "
"19473770","19475730"," It's, it's not as healthy as it was."
"19475870","19477630"," The NASDAQ is threatening its uptrend."
"19478070","19482870"," And of course, as you can guess, the Russell 2000 has just been kind of garbage quite a long time. "
"19483250","19485030"," Everyone's almost forgotten about that dumpster fire."
"19485190","19486770"," It's probably the short leg of most people's trades."
"19487510","19490630"," At some point, it's probably going to rip up 6% in a day and smash a lot of those"
"19490630","19490810"," people. "
"19490990","19491930"," But who knows when that's right?"
"19492490","19496210"," Kind of got to preview that Jackson hole when everyone was short the Russell, the ETF was out of"
"19496210","19499590"," shares, then it ripped up 3% higher when Powell came out wearing his Dove suit."
"19500510","19505210"," So, can you guys hear Jim now?"
"19522050","19522810"," Can you hear Jim?"
"19526270","19527130"," Let us know in the chat."
"19532670","19532930"," Yeah. "
"19536330","19540750"," They said no, they're saying no, no, no, no, no, no."
"19541230","19542450"," Lots of nose coming in."
"19546750","19551110"," Do you want to, do you want to go back to the way we did it on signal last time?"
"19561010","19562490"," Yeah, we should catch up this weekend. "
"19600670","19600950"," Right."
"19608760","19609100"," Right."
"19618150","19618370"," Yeah. "
"19627380","19627380"," Yeah."
"19628880","19629340"," Yeah."
"19629700","19630120"," I agree. "
"19643720","19643920"," Yeah."
"19644440","19650220"," I don't, I think that, and what Jim's saying is essentially that the reaction in the market is not"
"19650220","19657320"," what people would expect if indeed the Fed was going to engage in this aggressive tightening regime"
"19657320","19663860"," of accelerated taper three to four rate hikes and running off the balance faster than they did 2017"
"19663860","19664740"," to 2019."
"19664740","19667360"," Like that's apocalypse for risk assets. "
"19667800","19672300"," So, you know, that's what Jim's saying, you know, that the market's not pricing that in."
"19672500","19674120"," And I agree 100%."
"19674120","19678180"," Like if you look at the terminal rate for Fed right now, you know, the terminal Fed funds rate"
"19678180","19685080"," that's being priced in by Fed funds futures is like 1.75% or just under 2% last time"
"19685080","19686140"," I checked it. "
"19686560","19689060"," So that's discounting the Fed's resolve."
"19689420","19693640"," If you look at, you know, what's happening in the treasury markets or the twos and fives, they're"
"19693640","19695220"," not selling down as hard as you would expect."
"19695220","19697940"," The Fed's really saying they're going to do three to four rate hikes. "
"19698560","19702500"," And you just don't see the kind of blowout, like high yield spreads tight."
"19702940","19704100"," They're really tight."
"19704520","19710000"," And that's not what you would see if, you know, liquidity conditions were expected to materially"
"19710000","19711900"," become constrained, right?"
"19712400","19715780"," So you just see a lot of different things, like another thing I see, and this speaks to exactly"
"19715780","19718400"," what Jim was saying, you skew, put skew. "
"19718840","19719500"," Where is it?"
"19720180","19721240"," Where's the hedging?"
"19721840","19722560"," There is none."
"19723280","19724540"," And that's really weird."
"19725420","19729560"," Like you're going, yeah, you go and you look at the put skew and you just like, no, put skew,"
"19729880","19734560"," it's levels that's like very complacent, but also just like a fearless market. "
"19734560","19735760"," You look at vol, vol's cheap."
"19736000","19741160"," I mean, yeah, the VIX is above 20, but it's 20.29. It's down on the day."
"19741840","19742700"," Think about that. "
"19743280","19744920"," There's no fear in this market."
"19745100","19745600"," No one cares."
"19746220","19747840"," People are not buying bonds either. "
"19748020","19749300"," Where's the fear in bonds?"
"19749760","19753200"," Well, you know, no one's buying, but people are selling their thirties and their tens and their"
"19753200","19753700"," fives today."
"19754240","19755940"," Not like aggressively, but they're fading them."
"19755980","19756680"," There's no fear there. "
"19756960","19758460"," There's a epic bid in the dollar."
"19758620","19759260"," It's nothing incredible."
"19759900","19761660"," And then gold and silver are getting thrown out too. "
"19762060","19764560"," You know, you got a little bit of a vid and crypto, nothing to write home about."
"19764560","19767620"," So this whole idea, like, oh, God, we're all going to die."
"19767640","19769180"," So all your stocks, it's nonsense. "
"19769760","19772780"," If that was true, then you would see a bid in defense of like utilities."
"19772880","19773900"," You see a bid in bonds."
"19774380","19779240"," You'd see low beta, low volatility, large caps being kind of the leader on the way down, meaning"
"19779240","19781400"," that they're losing the least or maybe even have a bid. "
"19782060","19785840"," And you know, you'd see a completely different market dynamic and put skew in volatility."
"19786480","19788360"," So sentiment is not trashed."
"19788660","19790500"," You know, people are not scared running for their lives. "
"19790700","19794540"," Now, one thing I'll mention about that is if they do start buying a lot of hedges, that's going to"
"19794540","19795700"," be very market negative."
"19796060","19798820"," You're going to put a lot of pressure on the market if they do actually get scared."
"19798820","19800260"," So we do need to keep that in mind. "
"19801000","19805360"," But right now, you know, this seems like a market that's trying to grind out a bottom today."
"19805820","19809620"," If you look at the NASDAQ, it's the strongest and rates are going up."
"19809840","19812680"," So that relative strength is telling you something there as well. "
"19813120","19819120"," There's demand in Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Taiwan, semi, Intel, Qualcomm, like all this stuff"
"19819120","19823200"," in the NASDAQ, you know, it's either flat or getting bid up if it's a pretty big component."
"19823840","19825680"," So to me, that's not that's not a vote of world."
"19825920","19829720"," I mean, and this is right before three day weekend or an hour before three day weekend, Mondays"
"19829720","19830100"," closed. "
"19830620","19836080"," If there was this big consternation about risk over this three day weekend, what's going to happen?"
"19836520","19840800"," You would see more hedging, more selling, you would see, you know, you saw some pre market, I think"
"19840800","19843160"," they shook some, some people out on those bank earnings."
"19843740","19845560"," But like, this is not a market."
"19845760","19846860"," It's like going off a cliff. "
"19846860","19852280"," This is a market that's trying to figure out if it can start to grind higher in my opinion."
"19852280","19855840"," Now, of course, we could come in on Monday and limit down and because something happened over the"
"19855840","19858080"," weekend, there's no way to tell what the future is going to be."
"19858220","19859580"," But people aren't positioning for doom. "
"20021340","20022040"," Yeah, I agree."
"20022340","20022660"," I agree."
"20022780","20022980"," There is. "
"20023240","20023960"," There definitely is."
"20024240","20027560"," And you know, sometimes it could be the exact opposite of what it appears because we don't get to"
"20027560","20029300"," see all the counterparty positioning and stuff."
"20029500","20031180"," But yeah, it's going to be very interesting to dissect. "
"20031480","20032160"," I look forward to it."
"20032160","20034580"," Oh, yeah."
"20060090","20060790"," Yeah, there. "
"20060850","20062310"," And there was that there was the bank earnings."
"20062430","20063490"," So it's perfect timing for that."
"20063650","20100020"," Some folks probably knew about those bank earnings too before it's a"
"20100020","20100120"," good. "
"20104720","20109700"," Yeah, I mean, that's been the pattern in earning seasons prior for smaller companies."
"20110140","20114280"," So we could certainly see that become a pattern for some of these larger ones that are, you know,"
"20114360","20116340"," arguably priced to perfection, like Apple."
"20142060","20142540"," Yeah. "
"20143620","20149360"," Yeah, there's definitely growing potential for a rug pull and then for the Fed to make a big U-turn"
"20149360","20151160"," and really just screw both sides."
"20156870","20157210"," Yeah."
"20157510","20158330"," And that would be the market. "
"20159090","20160090"," That would be the market, right?"
"20160250","20161950"," Can you guys hear Jim through my setup at all?"
"20162150","20165490"," Like I kind of pipe the speaker through through my headphones."
"20165810","20166670"," Can you hear that at all?"
"20170100","20172060"," So try to make it loud enough that you could hear him."
"20175840","20176340"," Let me know. "
"20176420","20177440"," Jim, say something too."
"20187970","20189270"," Well, I could do that if you want."
"20192350","20192690"," Okay. "
"20198510","20198870"," All right."
"20199010","20199230"," All right."
"20199410","20199410"," Cool. "
"20199630","20200150"," We'll cap it here."
"20200250","20200370"," Copy."
"20201390","20202770"," Let's, let's plan to catch up. "
"20203050","20207370"," You know, maybe after market or this weekend or whatever works best and we go through all this and"
"20207370","20211310"," then get this going so everyone can enjoy the conference having a panel on."
"20214760","20215880"," All right, man, you too."
"20324000","20325560"," Check one two, you guys hear me now?"
"20327710","20329830"," It kind of sets, it kind of messes with. "
"20330230","20333600"," I think tight here."
"20345470","20346190"," Check one two."
"20379030","20379730"," You guys hear me?"
"20390600","20391260"," Yeah, I'm on. "
"20391380","20391860"," I'm back, huh?"
"20393180","20394040"," All right, good, good."
"20400650","20402510"," I may be canceling Netflix on this news."
"20402510","20404110"," It was only up five bucks when I signed up. "
"20407250","20412320"," Yeah, it's a, it's on the back end."
"20412440","20418640"," I know it seems like, I know it seems like from what you see on camera out there that I"
"20418640","20423280"," just plug this stuff into a YouTube channel and broadcast."
"20423960","20432280"," But there is a whole engineering side in the background of mixing and scenes and sources and audio"
"20432280","20432840"," captures. "
"20433420","20440400"," And then when I went through markets and mayhem's discord, you end up losing all those captures and"
"20440400","20445520"," then have to recapture his stuff on mine."
"20445800","20446260"," It's complicated."
"20447720","20452460"," And so I have to host through my discord is the plan. "
"20452760","20454780"," That is the plan, but my discord is not open yet."
"20454860","20455540"," It should be open soon."
"20456060","20457560"," So it'll be easier to host people. "
"20458000","20461620"," And if any of you out there want to be on the show at some point, we can always have"
"20461620","20462280"," you guys on here."
"20462760","20469120"," As soon as they get, as soon as they get this, we got 760,000 more than there are currently"
"20469120","20470900"," set to be sold on MOC."
"20471300","20471960"," It is an imbalance. "
"20474690","20475650"," Paul's done for the day."
"20475690","20476690"," Have a great afternoon, Paul."
"20477170","20478090"," Good to see you, brother. "
"20479310","20483530"," Is something been some good day trading on ES today and the spy?"
"20487470","20489090"," Let me look at this real quick."
"20519400","20520120"," It's really weird."
"20520260","20521480"," I've got Marvel. "
"20533610","20538350"," Yeah, it's a great guy out there too."
"20538470","20540350"," I know like Paul, I want to have him on the show."
"20540550","20541370"," I want to have Joe on. "
"20541370","20542870"," I want to have invest on."
"20543110","20545570"," I want to have a bunch of other people on in this show."
"20547510","20548410"," Even new traders. "
"20548530","20552210"," If you're a new trader having you on as well, it always gives insight to other people."
"20553850","20555090"," We've all been there, right?"
"20555510","20558250"," Everybody's been a new trader at one point, new investor at one point."
"20559050","20569850"," So we'll have a bunch"
"20569850","20570670"," out to you this weekend. "
"20571970","20575430"," I'll have you come through and I'll have you walk through the discord and tell me what I'm doing"
"20575430","20581230"," wrong and doing right because yesterday I was working on discord and some of what I did was right"
"20581230","20582270"," and some of it was wrong."
"20582490","20582910"," It was clunky."
"20583130","20590570"," You know, you have to like before you release something for public consumption, you want it to not"
"20590570","20594550"," have, I know the publicly sees certain parts of what you're doing. "
"20594930","20599450"," They don't see the backside engineering of what it takes to get things out there so that it's"
"20599450","20600050"," smooth enough."
"20600990","20605610"," Even when things fail on the or on this type of equipment, things fail all the time."
"20605910","20612690"," So even you wouldn't believe how hard it was just to get the stream set up to stream with only"
"20612690","20618350"," a short delay, like 30 second delay took me like a week to figure out exactly what what it took"
"20618350","20627710"," to put out a stream of 60 frames per second, 1080p had to had to rearrange the the"
"20627710","20629250"," GPU in my computers. "
"20629310","20632170"," I had to I've got a bunch of different displays set up."
"20632770","20636150"," I have to use the specific wiring, right?"
"20636530","20637810"," I have to use USB 3."
"20641520","20642360"," Yeah, I love discord."
"20648510","20649590"," You don't have to have ideas either. "
"20649750","20650950"," You just talk about what you're doing, right?"
"20652210","20656370"," Yeah, Sporky says he put a shout out in the and DM, so I will check that."
"20656750","20664210"," I haven't had a time to check DMs. I've been I've been being pulled specifically with this stuff is"
"20664210","20669070"," I've been consumed by the work that goes into trying to get this up and running. "
"20669410","20670990"," It'll all go away at some point."
"20671110","20672470"," So I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel."
"20672810","20677310"," I know that at some point it becomes kind of plug and play, but to get to that plug and"
"20677310","20681170"," play, there's a lot of back back and work that needs done. "
"20685690","20687830"," Yeah, mostly due to the Wall Street, that many a discord."
"20688370","20697610"," Hey, Sporky, I was in the Wall Street bat discord prior to the prior to when they did they shut"
"20697610","20698050"," it down?"
"20699290","20701290"," Or did they do they make it private?"
"20701770","20704170"," You know if they made it private, I might still be a member of the discord."
"20705630","20707170"," I'm on another handle that I have. "
"20718130","20719010"," Take it easy, Chris."
"20720690","20721790"," Yeah, market to may."
"20721930","20722130"," I'm today. "
"20722270","20724750"," Give me a shout and talk about it."
"20733980","20738040"," Viacom was ripping there for a minute and then bounced right off 36."
"20739060","20741140"," People were buying 40 C's on it. "
"20741780","20743760"," I doubt we get up to 40 C maybe."
"20744940","20748080"," Viacom seems like it's trading a lot like Qcom."
"20750170","20752810"," It is very bullish though in its stance right here. "
"20753410","20754890"," It wouldn't surprise me to see it."
"20755390","20757190"," To see Viacom rip higher."
"20757530","20759690"," If you look at Viacom, it's in a very bullish stance. "
"20759950","20767030"," One, two, three got like 15 trading days of in three taps above it on Viacom right now."
"20767030","20772390"," So a lot of traders are buying 40 C's on Viacom."
"20773310","20775170"," I think they're 36 cents. "
"20777470","20781650"," 40 C expiring January 28th on Viacom."
"20781750","20783590"," They're looking for a squeeze right now into the close."
"20788670","20790270"," Yeah, I can check to see if L is at resistance. "
"20805710","20808410"," Yeah, Jess, I'll bring up Tesla for you as well."
"20809090","20810110"," I'll check Netflix too."
"20817100","20822940"," Vix is at the low of the Yeah, this week's been very good overall. "
"20823460","20827840"," It's kind of a dud for me this morning, but I've had a wonderful week."
"20827960","20829580"," I can't complain about this week."
"20831120","20834420"," I've bought in and out of Viacom over the past month or so two months. "
"20839060","20840760"," What do I put stops when opening a position?"
"20841680","20842700"," It depends."
"20843180","20848780"," I have to do some videos for you guys on stops, when to hold, when to fold, when it doesn't"
"20848780","20849440"," matter anymore."
"20851800","20858400"," Johnny five saying a big TLT call block just came in 99.15 million that is not good for tech. "
"20862960","20865900"," Yeah, so Viacom's looking for a push into the close."
"20867840","20869460"," KR is starting to fail."
"20883170","20884870"," Vix is kind of doing its thing, right?"
"20885030","20886330"," Some sideways stuff here. "
"20887210","20894730"," Vix looks like it's, you know, I guess you could, you could say that Vix is bouncing around in"
"20894730","20895150"," here, right?"
"20895510","20897550"," Consolidating, but it's looking pretty weak right now."
"20898910","20900210"," And that's my expectation."
"20900510","20909840"," Expectation is that, is that Vix slides down, soups down, sells off into the close"
"20909840","20915140"," and markets mayhem was talking about, you know, what the plan is for next week. "
"20916300","20916840"," Can you be short?"
"20917220","20924400"," Can you be long into Tuesday and you really are looking for an all honesty for today."
"20926160","20929420"," You're looking for what happens."
"20931340","20934140"," You're, you need to see hedging come into the market today. "
"20934660","20935260"," It is critical."
"20936120","20940780"," You're either going to see weakness into next week or you're going to see a solid market."
"20941380","20943060"," I'm going to repeat this to you. "
"20943140","20943260"," Okay."
"20943460","20944880"," I want you guys to understand this out there."
"20946440","20948940"," It's a, there's more buyers and sellers on lows. "
"20949980","20951160"," It's a boomer stock."
"20952900","20954680"," Your resistance above at $62."
"20957580","20959260"," No one's really trading it right now. "
"20961810","20962950"," By the dip is 58."
"20963150","20964150"," You're kind of diddling in the middle."
"20965330","20967630"," Your next resistance above is $64. "
"20972070","20978730"," You got a little light resistance above at $61.93. So I do want you guys to understand that I"
"20978730","20985250"," want, I need to let you guys, you guys got to hear this again as we move it."
"20985370","20986590"," So it's $3.17. Okay."
"20989960","20991380"," You guys got to fully understand. "
"20992260","20993600"," You've got earning season."
"20995700","21002400"," Perfect time for an excuse to sell even great ERs."
"21002560","21004780"," You saw it yesterday with, with Citigroup, right?"
"21004960","21011320"," We talked specifically about Citigroup, how it would trade and it did it to the T."
"21011960","21016160"," It traded exactly how we anticipated it trading into today. "
"21016920","21017720"," To the T."
"21023130","21032820"," So if you look at the ER tech names, the"
"21032820","21039580"," names have been run up when they report, are they going to sell off?"
"21043850","21045570"," Unless they have some news we don't know about, right?"
"21045730","21049310"," Like company X, an Apple car, something like that."
"21049410","21055690"," You're probably going to break ahead, break a break above here on Netflix, big rip on Netflix right"
"21055690","21060150"," now, crashing through some resistance at $5.35, $31."
"21061190","21069600"," You might be asking what is above here, if Netflix can make this run, there's no stopping above,"
"21069760","21070300"," just so you know. "
"21070800","21071820"," Get clear skies above."
"21072320","21081870"," A little bit of ice, around $5.39.86. Take a little bit closer look."
"21086230","21096400"," Got a little bit of ice above here, right here, $5.39.84. All"
"21096400","21099300"," right, you guys put the piece of paper, if you got a piece of paper and a pencil at home"
"21099880","21104120"," or a pen, get a piece of paper and a pen and just write this stuff down. "
"21105880","21110980"," Okay, so this morning we're looking at Apple and I'm talking to you about Apple."
"21111120","21113120"," I said this is the perfect setup for a bear."
"21114480","21116040"," It's not the setup for a bull. "
"21117160","21122280"," At the same time it being a perfect setup for a bear, it's also a perfect setup for a squeeze."
"21124620","21129800"," So what happens if Apple squeezes, bears have a bad bad positioning."
"21132600","21139760"," That would mean that if you're a bear, you want to be waiting for it. "
"21139780","21145120"," It also sets up for let's say there's a great ER on Apple and it squeezes to 190 or 200"
"21145840","21150760"," in the after hours and you're stuck in calls."
"21151660","21157500"," What if they squeeze up Apple to 190 just before earnings and you can't get out of your calls and"
"21157500","21158580"," they sell it down the day before."
"21159260","21163200"," So there's like a lot of weirdness in where we are in these stocks. "
"21165000","21167920"," ER is a perfect time of the year, especially this year."
"21169160","21174960"," I know it's like this time is different but it is the perfect time this year to set up sell "
"21174960","21182080","-offs on stocks that have run up very high where their guidance for their future earnings might not"
"21182080","21182640"," be as great."
"21183940","21189980"," The next thing you have to think about right this next point down and that is that we have $125"
"21189980","21193920"," billion in call delta rolling off on the 21st. "
"21197040","21201480"," Next thing you write down is that we've got OPEC's 21st."
"21202120","21207100"," Next thing that you write down is that we have an FOMC meeting coming up."
"21208340","21214280"," The next thing that you write down is that you've got tapering right, the grass of tapering, you've"
"21214280","21215300"," got rates. "
"21216900","21224720"," The next thing that you have to write down is that you're starting to see hedging in places that"
"21224720","21225820"," you shouldn't be seeing it."
"21225940","21232140"," You're expecting to see it in the spy and in the cues, big tech."
"21232740","21234620"," You're not really seeing it right now at this moment. "
"21236140","21242380"," There was hedging taken out the last couple moves down we have we've had and those are still out"
"21242380","21249160"," and about and open but if they start hedging in places you're not looking for it and you have all"
"21249160","21256500"," that call delta rolling off, you have some events coming up and you have the fed talking about"
"21256500","21258120"," talking about doing this stuff."
"21260830","21268550"," Is it a setup for higher prices that we don't see coming or is a setup where you're not seeing"
"21268550","21276070"," the fear in the market like you should and they'll just be an excuse to sell the market kind of"
"21276070","21277390"," like leaving everybody bag holding."
"21280640","21285920"," You know the hedging on Kroger today gives a date of February the 18th. "
"21298740","21300280"," That whiskey is strong."
"21305340","21306740"," Looks like somebody's locked in the calls."
"21307680","21309540"," Looks like Joe Harper's locked in calls. "
"21315280","21316620"," Yeah, volatility crush."
"21319370","21321590"," I posted a chart of the VIX right going down."
"21339490","21340350"," I posted it on Twitter. "
"21341110","21342910"," Let me look at my Twitter VIX post."
"21344290","21347050"," Let's see if that's what's happening right now in the VIX."
"21375580","21376520"," Does this look right?"
"21383400","21389450"," I still haven't heard Mr. Yen's rant yet. "
"21389630","21390910"," I'm gonna listen to it today."
"21391390","21394350"," I had it queued up yesterday and I did not get on it."
"21394810","21398830"," I haven't been watching him because I don't want him to, I don't, I used to listen to Mr. Yen"
"21398830","21405710"," but I'm afraid that he's gonna influence me and I don't want to be influenced by anybody right now. "
"21417380","21424400"," Yeah, so I posted on Twitter that VIX should fall off today or into Monday and then we should have"
"21424400","21426420"," a nice fat rip into VIX next week."
"21427040","21432660"," Matter of fact, even the yellow arrow that I have is exactly on the 21st."
"21433240","21441280"," It's scaled by my yellow swooping, my yellow swooping a Twitter post is actually too scale. "
"21447000","21449540"," Cat please pump forward over 2519."
"21461010","21462930"," Let me see if I can report this guy."
"21478550","21480650"," Have you ever talked to Mr. Yen?"
"21481630","21482770"," Briefly once I did. "
"21487690","21489410"," I've spoken to him briefly once."
"21489830","21490790"," I try to leave him alone."
"21493590","21503500"," I try to leave Mr. Yen alone because I know he's sick and you"
"21503500","21504580"," know he's the greatest of all time. "
"21504800","21508700"," I've asked him for some help in the past and he's helped me out in the past as well."
"21514260","21515220"," I like him a lot."
"21515700","21517080"," I trade a lot like him. "
"21517760","21520200"," My trading often mirrors a lot of what he does."
"21522040","21522480"," I'm not exact."
"21523300","21527440"," We disagree sometimes but my trading is similar to his style. "
"21533520","21534740"," Hey, you should get a rip into clothes."
"21535240","21536840"," There's no reason why it shouldn't rip into clothes."
"21547280","21556320"," I don't want to poke the bear. "
"21559400","21561260"," Yeah, I like Mr. Yen a lot."
"21561840","21563420"," I like his trading style."
"21564060","21565760"," I like the simplicity and how he trades. "
"21566740","21568260"," I like that he keeps it simple."
"21575300","21576420"," Well, he's like me."
"21577320","21581420"," Publicly, everything looks simple and then in the background it's not near simple. "
"21581940","21588660"," Because once you know Captain or Mr. Yen enough, you know that he puts a lot of work into where"
"21588660","21589960"," he thinks we are in the market."
"21590440","21596380"," There are simple indicators that I use often but there's tons of work in the background that you're"
"21596380","21599060"," doing to get where you are in your market stance."
"21602720","21603880"," So same thing on the spot today. "
"21604720","21605400"," We're trading sideways."
"21605780","21606460"," Another sideways day."
"21607600","21609100"," Another consolidation day. "
"21609160","21614160"," I guess your question to the close here is what is the market thinking heading into the close?"
"21618130","21620950"," Watching huge Uber calls at this point."
"21621050","21628430"," We've been talking about Uber since the beginning this morning and Uber is just Uber ready."
"21629430","21639130"," 520, 45C, $400,000, Uber, 520, 45C, $500,000, Uber,"
"21639470","21644450"," $727,000, 45C, 520. "
"21645850","21654690"," So the Uber calls, if there were calls and we got TQQ calls coming in, $200,000, $9.2 million"
"21654690","21658630"," on 318 TLT-143."
"21659770","21661030"," That is not a good sign."
"21663300","21667120"," Uber, another call just call another set of calls came in. "
"21667420","21669360"," May 20th, 45C."
"21669840","21672680"," We've been talking about Uber since when?"
"21673240","21674200"," 9am, 930?"
"21676060","21678460"," Haven't stopped talking about Uber all day long."
"21682110","21686230"," Someone asked earlier for a spy trade and I told them the Uber trade. "
"21687010","21688670"," So why do we get this big Uber trade?"
"21689130","21689650"," I don't know why."
"21689930","21691750"," We just bounced below here at 40 bucks."
"21692770","21694110"," So now they think we're going higher. "
"21695490","21700230"," So I don't know if this is the catalyst to send Uber higher at this point or not."
"21701310","21702710"," I'm interested in this trade."
"21703770","21707310"," Is this a real bounce on Uber into the close or we're just not paying attention?"

"22821540","22822840"," I want to see if Viacom."
"22823020","22831400"," My fear on Viacom is that someone's buying the calls to push it up into the bell and then they're"
"22831400","22833460"," going to take their equity out of Viacom. "
"22836110","22836750"," Come on there."
"22836830","22838350"," Give me the Viacom ticker."
"22838390","22839110"," Let's see Viacom. "

"22856640","22857420"," You got 37. "
"22857900","22861420"," Looks like the sellers are coming down from above on Viacom."
"22861740","22863940"," So they might not get quite to 40 bucks."
"22864500","22866460"," You might want to pull the plug here at some point. "
"22867080","22873520"," Looks like the sellers are coming down to meet the price target up here."
"22873680","22875680"," The price target was that that's 40 bucks."
"22876440","22878140"," That's the price target on Viacom. "
"22878500","22880940"," Looks like some sellers are moving on down over here."
"22881020","22881600"," They don't like this."
"22882180","22883580"," They're stinky peeps right now. "
"22884380","22885460"," They're trying to do a rejection."
"22886020","22891400"," It would be neat too to see Viacom gap up on Monday because you would see huge short covering right"
"22891400","22891880"," off the bell."
"22899810","22901710"," Any plays over the weekend?"
"22903900","22905000"," You guys are sickos. "
"22908380","22910640"," Well, we have 10 minutes left."
"22911180","22919420"," Let me bring up on my end see what we have for ER reports happening after the bell today and"
"22919420","22920660"," into Tuesday real quick."
"22928050","22938440"," I want to see what we have in the docket for after the bell, before"
"22938440","22938940"," the bell. "
"22949650","22950290"," Okay, you ready?"
"22950690","22952850"," So before market open on Monday, we've got GS."
"22954770","22956290"," We've got Charles Schwab."
"22960440","22966540"," We have Petz Med, but Petz, P-E-T-S, but I haven't seen anything on them. "
"22967240","22969580"," We've got JB Hunt on Monday too on Tuesday."
"22969740","22970240"," That's a good one."
"22971600","22973200"," That's a good one to buy a stock in. "
"22974520","22975640"," I haven't checked their chart."
"22979380","22981880"," We have all kinds of banks on Monday, Tuesday."
"22982800","22984200"," Where's XLF at right now?"
"22985440","22987940"," We got a rack of banks. "
"22988500","22991080"," Uber's just blasting off right now into the bell."
"22991800","22993680"," Uber's just going to town right now."
"23000740","23002740"," XLF is catching a bid into the bell. "
"23002980","23004700"," Be conscious of that."
"23005340","23008980"," So XLF got beaten down and right now it's catching a bid."
"23010860","23012840"," This could be right into the bell here. "
"23013440","23014860"," Might be a nice trade for Monday."
"23015560","23021040"," If you want along the market into Monday, banks have done very well."
"23022460","23027300"," I know that we sell off the banks after this last one, but if you wanted to play the contrarian"
"23027300","23037260"," play over the weekend, let's have a look at XLF and see if anybody's in calls or puts. "
"23041460","23045420"," We got a bunch of puts sitting on XLF for Wednesday."
"23048960","23050560"," This is a good trade though, ready?"
"23052420","23057560"," January 28th, XLF 42C 18 cents."
"23058120","23061680"," There's a couple thousand contracts out there. "
"23062220","23070580"," There is a pin on XLF until Monday or Tuesday, but the moment that pin releases, those calls should"
"23070580","23070840"," print."
"23071720","23075160"," So if you want to trade for Monday or for next week, my trade would be XLF."
"23077080","23080120"," January 28th, 42C 18 cents. "
"23082950","23085410"," That's my trade for the close today."
"23095400","23099300"," Only other thing I'm going to be looking for here today is I'm just going to be watching into the"
"23099300","23102160"," close and see if there's any hedging coming in that we don't see."
"23102640","23104880"," Anything last minute that we're not made aware of. "
"23110270","23112210"," I don't like that that TLT."
"23113050","23117730"," If you expose yourself to XLF, XLF is ripping into the closing bell as well."
"23118410","23124450"," What I don't like about TLT is that it could impact parts of the spy and all of NASDAQ. "
"23126250","23129930"," I'd be playing individual tickers at this point and maybe staying away from the indexes."
"23133380","23135320"," I'm seeing some Tesla calls into the bell."
"23136020","23137360"," They're dated just for today. "
"23138160","23140380"," January 14th, 1035C."
"23141680","23148450"," They bought those at 3.48 p.m. I keep seeing UAL calls."
"23149190","23150810"," No, UAL is not done well. "
"23151030","23153470"," None of the airlines have done well, but the CAFLO has been huge."
"23154610","23158130"," The CAFLO on the airlines have been monster today."
"23158730","23166310"," Even though B.A. printed, the CAFLO on UAL today was monstrous. "
"23166730","23168270"," Someone knows something that we don't know."
"23168530","23169430"," I don't know what that is."
"23171110","23173690"," It's in a kind of a bullish stance right here. "
"23173990","23174950"," This isn't a bear flag."
"23175710","23180830"," I forget what this is called, but UAL might be a nice trade as well."
"23182210","23184850"," Someone knows something that we don't know about UAL. "
"23186150","23188850"," Unless it's just, I don't think it's just retail."
"23189370","23192150"," They're getting January 21st, 48C."
"23203920","23206100"," MQ, look at MQ right into the clothes here. "
"23206880","23208760"," MQ, they caught a bid."
"23209460","23211000"," They slammed off 1293."
"23211580","23214120"," Someone bought like a million dollars in calls on MQ. "
"23218630","23221910"," They got February 18th, 15C."
"23226480","23227500"," They didn't get a million."
"23227680","23228620"," They spent a couple hundred grand. "
"23229080","23232540"," That's still a lot of money for a fifteen dollar ticker."
"23233160","23234180"," They must know something."
"23250580","23251920"," Spy is now green. "
"23255540","23258080"," At the bell, Spy has turned green for the day."
"23274050","23275350"," Thank you, Stealing your tendies."
"23284190","23286450"," Bears are in full rage mode right now. "
"23286770","23288710"," They are just loading up on puts."
"23289750","23292030"," Hair indicator is turning negative at this moment."
"23292870","23295790"," I don't think that that implies what the move is on Tuesday or Wednesday. "
"23296910","23301410"," I think puts can get kind of screwed on Tuesday as well, just from the theta burn."
"23301990","23304290"," But I do want you to be aware that there's a lot."
"23304590","23308470"," There is heavy put buying into the bell right now on the spy. "
"23312800","23314520"," Bears are raging pissed off."
"23315200","23322400"," Bears don't want to see us move up 50 points on the yes or on spy on this Friday."
"23329140","23330800"," This is not part of the bear narrative. "
"23334750","23339850"," And if you look on where, if you open a chart in a monthly, spy looks very bullish."
"23339850","23344850"," Into the close right now, if you're looking at this chart, this chart does not look bearish at all."
"23345750","23347110"," It looks very bullish. "
"23351000","23358500"," We did not sell down today to forty five six seventy five, which is what bears would have wanted."
"23360600","23366530"," We basically hit trend, right?"
"23367930","23371130"," So nothing is saying here that we're uber book bearish."
"23373710","23377910"," If you're, I mean, this is what we're talking about with markets to mayhem this morning. "
"23379050","23380790"," You guys couldn't hear half what I was saying."
"23380790","23381970"," And I'm telling markets to mayhem."
"23381970","23389250"," I'm like, you know, for all of this action here, you still on the monthly have a higher low today. "
"23390170","23393270"," You still have a higher low on the monthly today."
"23396170","23400610"," No matter how you're looking at it, you have a higher low."
"23401710","23404270"," I'll look at it on the yes and see if I see something different. "
"23432120","23435820"," You know, as far as technical indicators go, we bounced off."
"23436220","23440460"," I had this like dotted white line down here going back to shipping."
"23442440","23445280"," This thing goes back all the way to October 21st. "
"23448010","23449630"," It goes back the entire year."
"23453480","23461900"," And we tagged an entire year at the bottom of the or back to 2020 back to March 25th."
"23462340","23464520"," We tagged a major support line today. "
"23466690","23468730"," So bears want to see us fail here."
"23468730","23470930"," There's no two, no two ways about it."
"23471310","23477630"," This is like the last support trend channel line that we're on right here on Friday. "
"23479850","23482150"," It's kind of like that do or die moments in the market."
"23501420","23504180"," The other channel that I've got's been running since March of 2020."
"23504300","23506320"," I can show it to you guys where I'll post it right now. "
"23509250","23511150"," This channel has been running since 2020."
"23514170","23528850"," The other than the other than the we had that one moment in March where we had it's"
"23528850","23533150"," kind of a messy chart, but it tags up nicely too."
"23533470","23534290"," It tags up nicely. "
"23539230","23546230"," Other than that one capitulation move back in March 2020 with that one capitulation move, it tags"
"23546230","23547810"," up beautifully to write where we are today."
"23548990","23556210"," So again, even if your book bearish today, they said no, we literally took it to the pin."
"23556570","23558870"," We went slightly below the pin went down to 4606. "
"23559870","23562070"," But the pin was basically 4608."
"23563170","23564890"," We ricocheted right off it today."
"23568480","23571080"," And we ricocheted off it on January 14th as well. "
"23573320","23578480"," So we're still, I mean, I want to say this, I don't want to discourage bears, but in the general"
"23578480","23581740"," picture, we have not broken bearish yet."
"23583160","23585280"," We did not get major hedging today."
"23587020","23591740"," We got some major hedging in where the where the where the scared bulls are hiding. "
"23592180","23593540"," We saw some of that today."
"23594320","23602280"," But we have not seen the follow through that the bears are looking for in no way, shape, or form."
"23605030","23606510"," Piton just got some calls. "
"23607190","23612770"," They got February 18th 30c $300,000 riot got some calls."
"23613670","23616990"," January 14th 20c or 40 for 40 grand."
"23617310","23626510"," American Airlines January 21st 61.5c. I got a high algo score trade ATVI"
"23626510","23633110"," January 28th 71c $33,000. "
"23633450","23635850"," IWM has more calls coming in on it."
"23636410","23640510"," January 14th to 12c for half a million dollars."
"23642670","23648850"," This all of this IWM call flow helps right now for the calls that are coming off the market on"
"23648850","23649770"," the 21st. "
"23650790","23657490"," I just did IWM right now just heads up on IWM got another call just came in January 14th to"
"23657490","23662790"," January 14th to 12c a million dollar call on IWM."
"23664590","23667710"," This does not fit the narrative of the market crash."
"23668710","23669610"," It doesn't. "
"23678450","23681890"," You're expecting to see negative hedging today."
"23682770","23686810"," And instead we're seeing expanded call flow today, especially on IWM."
"23687830","23696880"," And that could be geared towards earnings, at least to prop up the market during earnings maybe. "
"23697460","23700120"," But we're not seeing the negative flow that we should be seeing today."
"23701100","23707830"," If you're bearish, yeah, I like ATVI too."
"23716220","23718100"," I got to listen to what Mr. Yen saying. "
"23722300","23723500"," I didn't get to see the video."
"23727360","23731720"," And that's the thing that that's the thing that market markets and mayhem and I are talking about"
"23731720","23738540"," is I don't you know for all the for all the posturing for the markets crashing."
"23739340","23743500"," I just I'm not seeing it like I'm looking for things to happen and they're not happening. "
"23746840","23752180"," I guess you never see a market crash coming but boy they telegraphed that it was coming."
"23752380","23758460"," They told us it was coming but we're not seeing the moves that need to happen for the market to"
"23758460","23762300"," actually go down to the levels that they're talking about."
"23772560","23774400"," This market has not rolled over. "
"23776200","23777420"," Today would have been the day."
"23781410","23783890"," It was a very critical moment down below here on the spy."
"23784710","23789610"," If you look on an ES chart for the year and you snap a line underneath it back to March,"
"23793640","23796560"," today was the day that the bears had the chance to push down below. "
"23799510","23803390"," I guess you can claim that we have a lower high back or we had to we had we hit"
"23803390","23810210"," 479.80 then we kind of rolled over here on the 20 on the on the 12th spy rolled over."
"23810410","23811090"," Yes rolled over."
"23811690","23814850"," I guess a bear could say that it will continue to roll over from here right. "
"23814990","23817950"," You might hear bears say I will go up on Monday to our Tuesday Wednesday."
"23818650","23826130"," We'll start selling down into into opex and that called out the roll off."
"23827110","23829570"," But there are calls coming into the market right now. "
"23830790","23838410"," Which goes against the calls rolling off on on the 21st."
"23840260","23847240"," My assumption is you're going to hear bears say that we're going to roll up and get rejected around"
"23847240","23852540"," 468 and that will be rolling over some they're not going to give you a date."
"23852720","23857460"," They're going to tell you it's going to happen next week sometime Friday Monday Tuesday like the"
"23857460","23860200"," 21st 24th 25th. "
"23860420","23861640"," That's what they're going to claim to you."
"23862780","23864260"," That's what I would claim if I was a bear."
"23866610","23873750"," But overall in this contextually nothing here has said or even implies that the market's going"
"23873750","23874090"," down. "
"23875050","23876870"," These all look like normal moves."
"23877190","23879070"," Everything here looks like normal moves."
"23881200","23886320"," Had an all time high back on November 5th. "
"23886320","23894740"," Had an all time high back on November 16th."
"23895540","23898360"," Made another all time high on December 28th."
"23899320","23903000"," Made another all time high back on January 4th. "
"23904200","23905340"," Swooped back down."
"23905640","23907420"," We've touched now one, two, three."
"23907960","23915800"," This today is the fourth touch down below on a trend line going the entire year. "
"23917100","23920860"," So the prudent thing to do down here is to take along."
"23921580","23927320"," And all truthfulness it is to take along to 485."
"23931190","23933070"," That's what this looks like on paper. "
"23933750","23940930"," Looks like you take looks like you take this up to 485."
"23941150","23942690"," Even if you don't believe it's going there."
"23943450","23947450"," The chart for two years says that you take this to 485. "
"23952480","23953440"," That's what it says."
"23959130","23963510"," So I'm going to stick around with you just to check and see if there's anything coming in that we"
"23963510","23963930"," don't see."
"23964690","23966010"," We've got a few more minutes left. "
"23966690","23969310"," I want you guys to all have a wonderful afternoon and a wonderful weekend."

"24018200","24020780"," If you guys look on a two-year chart right now, right?"
"24021600","24022040"," Nothing."
"24022340","24027060"," If you scale out nothing like nothing in an overall picture."
"24029720","24034400"," I'm not saying this is the time where we don't crash the market but I'll tell you what if you"
"24034400","24036240"," bought the dip today, right?"
"24036960","24043380"," It's the same dip that's been bought basically since two years ago. "
