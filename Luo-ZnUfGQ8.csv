"63150","64370"," Check 1-2."
"71630","72350"," Good morning. "
"73690","74550"," Just a second here."
"78050","90360"," Hope you"
"90360","90980"," all had a great weekend."
"103820","105540"," Go right into it this morning. "
"106340","107720"," To me, just a second here."
"109380","111500"," I'm going to throw an ad in, so I apologize."
"111920","113540"," I should have done that earlier, but I didn't. "
"114860","120840"," I'm going to throw in just the beginning here."
"121400","122720"," All right, subscribers only."
"123780","124460"," Any duration. "
"126200","126680"," Save."
"128300","130580"," A bunch of wonky stuff I'm going to do here."
"130740","132100"," I'm running a little bit behind this morning. "
"136540","138200"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"139040","140260"," What is going on?"
"140880","141780"," It's like really weird."
"141780","144980"," I can't get top comments to go to any comments. "
"149560","150440"," Okay, whatever."
"150780","151280"," That's what it is."
"151780","152320"," There it is. "
"157750","158990"," News comments saved."
"159270","161050"," There's a ton of stuff I'm going to do in the background here."
"163570","168390"," What else is weird is that comments aren't coming up in the stream yet, and I don't know why that"
"168390","168950"," is either. "
"170150","171510"," Let me check that."
"172290","173470"," See what's going on with that."
"174230","175950"," Okay, it says it says it says it's above it. "
"176090","185530"," So we'll see if comments show up in the always show"
"185530","186230"," messages."
"187570","188130"," Hide delay."
"188510","189510"," I don't know what hide delay means. "
"194490","205340"," Save messages, turbo badges, chat box."
"205640","206340"," Let's see if that works."
"207160","216820"," I don't know why chat's not coming up. "
"217100","217820"," All right, we'll see why."
"221100","223840"," Still having some issues this morning, and I don't know why."
"227580","231500"," All right, so there's a little black box over here on the left hand side. "
"231700","236820"," Can you guys see comments on the left hand side of your screen for that black box is?"
"237940","246480"," I guess we'll let it keep doing its thing and see if it's a team clean hide delay."
"246640","247340"," Always show messages."
"248680","252460"," Hide delay, chat delay, same with message animations. "
"254180","256220"," I don't fucking know what I'm doing wrong here."
"258060","263000"," Text color is white font size background color."
"266580","267480"," Oh, there you go. "
"270220","271060"," Hold on here."
"271900","273060"," All right, hold on here."
"273900","275260"," Let me see what I'm doing wrong here. "
"285500","288900"," We got some chat box action going."
"289140","290920"," It looks like I got chat box action going."
"291160","292700"," Now, let me look at a bigger thing here. "
"294600","295740"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"295900","296820"," That looks like some chat box."
"296980","298580"," I can be wrong there, but it looks like it's rolling. "
"300400","301600"," Tell me I'm doing this right."
"303200","305320"," I think I got the chat box up."
"312380","313980"," Looks like a chat box rolling. "
"315140","318940"," We'll see how that thing works out this morning, see if it works or not, because I know some of"
"318940","323360"," you are not on a device where you can actually see the chat."
"324480","325860"," We'll see if this chat box works."
"327600","330040"," It looks like it's not rolling on my end. "
"331580","332500"," Hide delay."
"333040","334340"," I don't know what that means."
"335880","337260"," Always show messages. "
"339300","339900"," Close."
"341520","343140"," We'll see what this does."
"344160","354720"," I don't know exactly what's going on here with this stuff, but I've"
"354720","357320"," got a news ticker for you. "
"359900","361060"," Just some changes."
"361540","364900"," Some things aren't up and running yet, but they will be at some point."
"367420","370080"," But there'll be a chat box now that you can see. "
"371980","377660"," If you're at home watching on a TV and not understanding the context of what we're talking about,"
"377660","380080"," maybe in an office or something like that."
"380500","386510"," You should be able to see that text box."
"386510","388830"," Let me log out of some of this stuff here. "
"393760","397660"," You also see a scrolling ticker, hopefully, on your screen this morning."
"398720","403680"," If you see any news down there that you would like to have me click on, I can do that."
"404080","410360"," In here, I can click on a news headline and read it to you in stream. "
"411980","414780"," I'm working on some bots in the background, but I'll be honest with you."
"414880","418100"," I kind of suck at writing bot script."
"419520","424800"," Even the videos I've watched, I think half of them don't know what they're doing or they don't know"
"424800","425200"," everything. "
"425220","427520"," You kind of have to be a bot master or something."
"428820","430740"," It's kind of like a domain for people."
"431280","432760"," So we're working on that in the background. "
"433380","440680"," I've been down like six rabbit holes this weekend that I did well on, and then I went down another"
"440680","443460"," six rabbit holes this weekend where I totally failed."
"445260","446360"," So I don't know."
"447060","453760"," I feel if you're a programmer, or I don't know if you do any kind of like development. "
"454980","458680"," Now I know why it takes you guys like six months to get something done."
"460000","461320"," I'm like, yeah, I'll have it done by the weekend."
"462280","464080"," Weekends like I'm just scratching the surface. "
"470420","472540"," You're working on the bots right now, Winky?"
"473960","476180"," Yeah, I think I gave Winky the power."
"477620","479340"," I was like, I just like, fuck this, Winky."
"479480","479900"," It's all yours. "
"482620","484560"," I think I gave Winky the power like the power."
"484680","485480"," He should have all the power."
"485640","488580"," He's really like when my house start dating my wife. "
"491260","493200"," Call my dog a different name or something."
"494700","497140"," Dog starts answering to Winky and no longer to me."
"499560","501380"," Yeah, we'll tell you about the Hendricks level this morning. "
"503880","505400"," So this morning, a couple of things."
"505800","506660"," Let's start the morning off."
"506840","508580"," First off, I hope you all had a great weekend. "
"510000","513039"," Matter of fact, we'll go back to I'm going to bring up Twitter real quick."
"513320","518570"," We're going to talk about Twitter and my annoyances with Twitter."
"519970","521370"," That's one of those this weekend too. "
"524210","527070"," It's trying to onboard some other moderators."
"528010","529690"," Some people trying to help the launch of the website."
"529690","536010"," Some partners in the background on Twitter, like onboard them, and it was a disaster. "
"537810","538870"," Hold on one second here."
"553440","554460"," All right, so."
"556940","558720"," That was a disaster in and of itself. "
"560860","565220"," Any kind of like JSON stuff, any kind of web hooks, like Twitter's."
"565580","568300"," Twitter's a philosophy right now about to implode in itself, I think."
"571320","572480"," Ask chat GPT. "
"573100","574580"," Chat GPT doesn't okay."
"576880","579340"," Okay, jobs by is bouncing right now."
"580140","581580"," I asked three. "
"582700","583920"," We're going to talk about Twitter though."
"584180","586380"," And there's an important reason we're talking about Twitter this morning."
"586520","586860"," Here you go. "
"586980","588500"," You got a bigger screen this morning too."
"589340","591060"," Over here, larger screen in front of you."
"593150","594370"," If at any point the. "
"595390","597130"," The scroller looks kind of wonky."
"597210","597510"," Let me know."
"597590","600230"," I can change the hertz from 30 hertz to 60 hertz. "
"602370","604490"," And we're going to talk about Twitter briefly here."
"604710","609940"," Let me see if I can show any of this on."
"610580","612080"," See if I can do this for you here. "
"614160","616280"," I don't know if I should bring it over or."
"619760","622240"," Let's talk about my last two posts on Twitter."
"624020","625520"," I don't even get this up here or not. "
"625680","627060"," One way or another, we're going to get it up here."
"628900","629260"," So."
"629640","631520"," I don't know that's not. "
"636840","638740"," It's going to be a little weird for me to."
"640760","643040"," So on this, uh, this is on February 16th."
"643060","643880"," This is very early tomorrow. "
"643880","645600"," It was like three o'clock in the morning or something like that."
"645640","646980"," The night before I was up with Chaz."
"647560","650000"," And I'm like, I'm trying to run through right now and see anything. "
"651420","652840"," So basically it was on the 15th."
"654220","659160"," SPX does not, uh, uh, price does not reflect momentum, uh, momentum."
"659980","663120"," Which is flashing five to six down sessions beginning today or tomorrow. "
"663120","664580"," We got those down sessions."
"665320","669060"," A update of conditions change, which they haven't."
"669060","673020"," But highly unlikely high risk of long without a hedge. "
"676100","678160"," Turn this, turn this shit off."
"678580","680840"," Uh, one to three month out."
"681060","682280"," Now calls are cheap and hold value. "
"682280","683780"," Well, not financial advice."
"684060","685200"," Just starting market signals."
"686940","690140"," This is kind of the key as we started to roll over was this post. "
"690740","695400"," My next post after that outside of you guys getting levels and live streaming."
"695580","696120"," That kind of stuff."
"696120","699520"," Talked about SKU, uh, as well, but that was it. "
"699660","700560"," That was really it."
"700700","704900"," Then the last post after that, uh, was support was just tagged at four or five."
"705100","707640"," There's a small gap above at four, six, four, seven. "
"708460","711320"," With negative and mental coming down on the five minute right now there."
"711860","716640"," Their polls would need to hold 407 to trade a squeeze higher to 410, which is unlikely."
"717520","718820"," Now this took place on Friday. "
"719860","721640"," We didn't get to 410, right?"
"722420","725880"," Uh, this was, I believe I posted this on Thursday or Friday."
"725880","727240"," Or Friday morning or something like that."
"728300","733320"," Um, and you can kind of see the yellow dotted lines, blah, blah, blah. "
"733640","741860"," Uh, bears want to close under 404.47 for the next leg down to 39721 with capitulation, low targets"
"741860","747000"," of 395.58. Now you're seeing that play out this morning, right?"
"747400","752500"," Uh, I'm going to show you this morning, the open in Friday's close, not Friday's close, but the"
"752500","754460"," first part of Friday morning."
"754880","757260"," And what bears wanted coming into today."
"757980","759820"," I want to click on the screen right here. "
"759900","761200"," This is before it all happened, right?"
"761660","763940"," This is actually before the bounce on Friday here."
"764620","767180"," Then we had that failure to close above, right?"
"767300","771760"," We knew going into Friday clothes that, uh, we didn't get above 410, right?"
"772240","773700"," Uh, there was, it didn't happen."
"773780","776860"," We have 409, I believe, after hours and SPX was kind of cool. "
"777340","779000"," We ended up selling below this morning."
"779640","783500"," Yeah, and this is for the next leg down, this portion of the trade."
"783500","786260"," So, you know, we're two, well, it's Tuesday morning. "
"786360","790920"," I keep saying Monday, uh, but we're looking for this next leg, uh, lower here."
"791440","795300"," 395, 396, 397 ish."
"796200","798540"," And this is the last post that I had left you with. "
"798660","801760"," I haven't, uh, posted anything else other than that."
"801760","806560"," So, so as far as we know at this point, uh, nothing has changed, right?"
"806980","812680"," It's been the same, uh, since at least the 15th, uh, believe it was the 15th or 16th."
"812680","815000"," They were on the 21st at this point. "
"815420","818520"," So I often get asked questions like, Hey, you know, where are we going?"
"818800","819540"," What's going on?"
"820120","822600"," Um, this is all kind of crazy, that kind of stuff."
"822780","826000"," But these are the last two posts, uh, that I've left you with."
"826000","829940"," And so even you as a trader or a dip buyer, uh, Friday was a pretty good dip. "
"829940","833440"," But on Friday, uh, let's take a look at Friday here."
"834260","839300"," We didn't, we didn't get the clothes on Friday underneath that 405 404."
"839300","840500"," You can see right now, 444. "
"841320","848460"," But one cool thing that did take place, uh, was that they, that the, the sellers degraded this"
"848460","850340"," level that was here, right?"
"850480","856720"," So this grind level 404 easily broken underneath this morning and then traded under."
"857460","859860"," Uh, so what do bears have to do today?"
"860580","864180"," Uh, pretty much all they have to do is hold this zone here, right?"
"864180","870480"," And we know, we know about, uh, selling into the minutes as well, the Fed minutes, which I believe"
"870480","875100"," are tomorrow unless they have some, yeah, tomorrow and Wednesday at the Fed minutes here, right?"
"875660","880560"," So bears only need to have turned this support into resistance."
"880780","885340"," And now hopefully to this morning, they should be able to do the same kind of a thing. "
"885860","890900"," Now there are some gaps above here that I don't, I'm not sure if these got closed yet this morning"
"890900","893180"," or not, but I was up at like four or five o'clock this morning."
"893180","894020"," I was up here."
"894120","895520"," I was doing all kinds of shit last night. "
"895540","896140"," I didn't go to bed."
"896700","898320"," So I slept in this morning."
"899120","901720"," We'll go to a one hour real quick and see if those gaps are still there. "
"901920","902920"," I think they were there this morning."
"903580","903780"," Yeah."
"903880","905680"," So they closed all these gaps above here. "
"905780","906720"," They're gone now, right?"
"907520","911980"," Looks like we traded up close those gaps that were left behind at some point."
"912440","916380"," I guess you could say that we'd have a gap still to close up there."
"916460","921140"," We could put an H line in, uh, for Jason Hendricks of a man, Jason right here. "
"921140","925660"," If you wanted to do a little, a little, a little H line above here."
"926600","928620"," Uh, we'll come back to the one minute chart."
"929860","931740"," See how high that is right there. "
"932720","933900"," Right up in here."
"934200","936440"," I guess you could say that that gap wasn't closed."
"936720","937740"," They'll try to pull a technical. "
"938000","941820"," This got closed in pre market, but we'll put an H line in there."
"942460","944280"," This morning, so we'll just write H line above."
"946600","950720"," Uh, but generally speaking, right?"
"950720","955080"," We've got the minutes tomorrow and let's you want to see this here. "
"955320","961640"," Sellers want to stay under S one right for the move lower to three ninety six."
"961680","966700"," I'll show you the rest of that, um, uh, where that target is down below."
"968400","970660"," Heading into tomorrow, right?"
"970900","976640"," So my point being here is that, uh, we don't really need to grind through this at this point. "
"976640","983060"," If you're a bear at least or a seller, if you want to buy a good dip, uh, you'd hope"
"983060","989620"," for some kind of, uh, either closure or failure above somewhere in here and then some kind of"
"989620","995340"," continued selling or panic down into the minutes over here and then threats and social media."
"995600","1001280"," I think last week on the 15th or 16th, we talked about how you're going to hear bears talking about"
"1001280","1001940"," a market crash."
"1001940","1006360"," And sure enough, over the weekend, I got an email from a sub seller. "
"1007180","1010980"," That was like, if we break 400, uh, the markets going to crash."
"1013040","1014140"," Oh, it's kind of bizarre."
"1014660","1015780"," Uh, this is a, you know, a major. "
"1016440","1023700"," My assumption is at this point, this person was either paid or is short and wants the market to go"
"1023700","1024000"," down."
"1024700","1029700"," Uh, so I don't know if that's the case, but I was slightly scratching my head over that."
"1029700","1034619"," Uh, that take on the market heading down here. "
"1034980","1038720"," Into tomorrow's, I was a little, that was a little shocked at that."
"1039180","1043160"," Um, one, because you need a velocity type move."
"1043500","1046200"," And I'll show you in previous examples when we get a velocity type move. "
"1046640","1051740"," How that happens, and it's actually usually takes some time, usually takes more than."
"1052440","1053980"," Uh, one session."
"1053980","1059800"," Uh, it takes a lot of, um, uh, breaking, breaking reasons or breaking support. "
"1060500","1062960"," Uh, and then some violence moves higher."
"1063580","1066420"," Uh, and then we finally actually break through that last support."
"1067720","1071600"," It's not, it would take an event outside of the minutes. "
"1072040","1078000"," In my view, at least, at least historically, even last year, would take something larger than just,"
"1078000","1080060"," we start trading down below 400."
"1080740","1083120"," We just start blasting two levels like it's nothing."
"1083500","1086880"," Uh, you kind of need more than just, yeah, it just happens. "
"1087080","1088260"," It doesn't ever just happen."
"1088660","1093080"," You can actually go back on every crash in previously looking, uh, not every crash."
"1094180","1096260"," You can look back on most every crash. "
"1096940","1100120"," Uh, and there's a reason that is happening in behind the scenes."
"1101000","1103580"," Uh, that you can actually look at and say, look, we have a chance of a crash."
"1104480","1109140"," Uh, the only time I've seen a, we've only seen two historic, two or three historically where, uh,"
"1109140","1111900"," uh, they were events that were unknown, uh, to the market. "
"1112120","1118260"," These are events like 9-11, uh, where it doesn't show itself, uh, pre and previous charts."
"1119520","1122900"," Let me see if I can get a bring up something here for you."
"1126420","1126860"," Sweet. "
"1127800","1128440"," All right."
"1128900","1129980"," Well, I got to make that smaller."
"1131940","1136790"," Let me, uh, let me mute that right there. "
"1137330","1137490"," Too big."
"1137490","1137650"," Okay."
"1138950","1142190"," So we're going to take a look here on, uh, the spy. "
"1144530","1149930"," Uh, just for your morning here and we're going to take a look at, uh, the one minute here."
"1151430","1153150"," And we're just going to take a peak here."
"1154130","1155970"," So that you're all not panicking out there. "
"1157330","1159610"," And, uh, you want to stay above the one minute."
"1159810","1167050"," You know this as a, uh, as a bull or bear for above the one minute, the, uh, bulls are"
"1167050","1167850"," now in charge."
"1168890","1170750"," They're fighting for it right now. "
"1171350","1173610"," Um, so you want to be seeing."
"1179340","1183460"," Uh, the bulls want to win, uh, 40201."
"1184220","1186240"," If they don't win for 201. "
"1187060","1190480"," Now I'll make another in the background what, what you're not looking at."
"1190540","1191780"," I'll put a little box over here."
"1192500","1194840"," For a target scratch that. "
"1195160","1195600"," I'll see it here."
"1196620","1197060"," 40202."
"1201220","1203120"," Right here, bulls need to win that. "
"1204100","1205560"," Um, so you go higher."
"1205800","1206000"," Okay."
"1206220","1209320"," They need to win that for, or, or, or O two zero two. "
"1209640","1211580"," Uh, next leg down."
"1212060","1215860"," If we, if the bulls do not win that, I'm going to get put one more above here."
"1216100","1217120"," It's 40281. "
"1218580","1220260"," Let me draw a little box here."
"1225000","1225960"," Right here."
"1227020","1227500"," Okay. "
"1229100","1234620"," Now if the bulls can't get above these two levels right here, uh, if we're underneath the one, as"
"1234620","1239900"," long as we stay underneath the one and four, one and five minute, uh, we remain bearish."
"1240800","1246840"," And the bears want to tee off on these and have a target down below of 39748."
"1248720","1252540"," Uh, so I'll let me give a, uh, now you probably don't get exactly here. "
"1252540","1255060"," Uh, usually you come a little bit above it."
"1255260","1260440"," We're going to go to a natural stop point of, uh, 400 as, as target one."
"1261380","1262220"," Right here. "
"1263760","1268060"," And then target number two being 398 just below it."
"1270580","1272680"," Right down here, 398."
"1274700","1275580"," Right there. "
"1276140","1279500"," Two nice fat targets for our bears to get to this morning."
"1280080","1283680"," Uh, and we'll, I'll draw these out for you on the regular."
"1283680","1286460"," So you can see, uh, where they are. "
"1287040","1290160"," I mean, just a second here, you can chart this on your own chart."
"1290820","1294080"," Um, so we got 400 down below here."
"1297780","1299800"," And 398 just below it. "
"1304920","1306320"," Kind of see this stuff here."
"1307080","1310640"," And let me look at one other thing here in the background with the other, bring it back to the"
"1310640","1311360"," regular chart here."
"1316540","1318120"," Mainstream live, baby. "
"1319200","1319840"," All right."
"1325870","1327250"," All right down here."
"1328510","1333450"," So we know currently the one minute chart that the bears are in charge to this white line right"
"1333450","1333690"," here. "
"1334070","1335610"," You already know that the."
"1336530","1340610"," Oh, I'm going to bring some ship back up for you."
"1342810","1343670"," Where's the book map?"
"1344270","1344830"," All right, right there. "
"1345950","1347330"," Need to get a larger monitor."
"1351720","1354540"," There's one to stay in charge of this yellow box right here."
"1356620","1359020"," They want to stay in charge right here as well. "
"1360680","1362240"," 4842 somewhere down in here."
"1362920","1363400"," Right there."
"1365880","1366680"," So right there. "
"1366880","1367280"," This is both."
"1367440","1370020"," This is bears in charge price targets down below."
"1371520","1373100"," Have a nice fat one right here. "
"1373160","1375580"," This yellow box and then another fat one right down here."
"1383100","1385780"," You guys want me to make this smaller so you can see it, maybe."
"1387040","1388660"," With that helps you to see it better. "
"1388860","1389480"," There's S three."
"1390000","1394090"," There's S two right there."
"1395750","1397590"," That should work itself nice for you. "
"1411020","1412040"," Good morning, everybody."
"1412240","1413100"," How y'all doing this morning?"
"1413860","1416800"," You see what I can read from you in the comments."
"1427280","1428580"," Estile holding up nicely. "
"1429700","1435560"," As we come down and tag that 396 if you are an estile calls, you probably do want to take"
"1435560","1436280"," the money."
"1436880","1442160"," There is a part of velocity here and I'm looking at it in the background right now."
"1442200","1444300"," We'll see if we are losing velocity. "
"1445320","1447340"," Let me just check and see if we are."
"1468160","1470200"," This might actually be bottom right here."
"1471660","1473920"," Might be grabbing some calls here in just a moment. "
"1474620","1475940"," Just a second here."
"1478950","1480910"," Might be trying to buy this right here."
"1483410","1491050"," So if you are an estile calls, the estile relies upon downward movement to the market. "
"1491370","1494990"," When we begin to lose velocity heading on the downside."
"1495590","1501130"," So if we start to bottom out here slowly, you'll see estile lose value."
"1502090","1508730"," Now if we can blast down here today or tomorrow, but preferably down to the 3.98 today, it would"
"1508730","1510310"," be a good place to take profit. "
"1510850","1519350"," Either 25% off here of the estile calls and then maybe the difference down here at 3.98 at"
"1519350","1519850"," some point."
"1520570","1525130"," I know I was talking with someone on Friday that was saying that estile still hasn't been cranking,"
"1525530","1527290"," but they are looking beautiful this morning."
"1528430","1530230"," So they are actually doing quite well right now. "
"1533720","1534640"," So you'll look at them real quick."
"1536920","1541440"," So she gets a nice print off them down here at some point either today or tomorrow."
"1541860","1548120"," But just notice that if we start to roll higher at any point, that estile will begin to roll back"
"1548120","1551060"," down and you'll lose all the money that you made on those calls. "
"1556310","1557190"," Morning coffee."
"1557810","1558630"," Second round."
"1561490","1562850"," Second round of morning coffee. "
"1581870","1583710"," I was watching USO this morning."
"1583930","1586890"," I was watching oil today to see if there was a dip to buy an oil."
"1587970","1591150"," Oil on the market breath is almost at zero. "
"1591150","1593950"," It's one of the lowest readings right now."
"1596500","1596820"," All right."
"1596960","1598960"," So let's see what you guys are seeing. "
"1599080","1604920"," Now that I got a larger screen here, I kind of make this bigger so you can see it on"
"1604920","1606300"," a better chart here."
"1611400","1612020"," All right."
"1612040","1613960"," Let's go to the live chat here. "
"1615220","1619180"," And I've missed everything you guys have said so far."
"1622720","1626120"," The Hendrix slide is too strong to be defeated by conventional weapons."
"1626760","1628180"," Dude, that is awesome sauce. "
"1632130","1633630"," Dude, winky right on, brother."
"1633950","1635290"," I'm going back to the start of the chat, man."
"1635390","1636170"," I'm going to read through it all. "
"1638170","1639650"," Dude, right on, winky."
"1640570","1640970"," I didn't winky."
"1641130","1641770"," I didn't know, man. "
"1642070","1646510"," There was like the bot had like ways to give people points."
"1648050","1654390"," I was trying to figure out how to give people points where like you read a line of command where"
"1654390","1659730"," if they, let's say they do a dollar sign in three letters or four letters, you could like inform"
"1659730","1668710"," them that they have to make a post like spy current price and then where it's going, like current"
"1668710","1670090"," next or something."
"1670750","1672430"," Now next or something like that. "
"1672970","1681450"," And then let's say we're at, let's say we're at 40131 and they say we're going to 400 that we"
"1681450","1687570"," can go back with the bot and give award them points so we can find out who's given good alpha"
"1687570","1691850"," and counter alpha to the stream and then show the points that they've earned."
"1692930","1698090"," And I'll try to figure out some kind of a way for them to gamble it off with each other"
"1698090","1703190"," or you can like the magic eight ball or a slot machine or something so they can gamble that money."
"1704490","1706430"," Like fake dollar bills or something. "
"1707670","1709610"," Maybe I can give a winner once a week."
"1710710","1711410"," Some merchandise."
"1712370","1714290"," I worked on some merchandise this weekend. "
"1714550","1715450"," I have some merchandise."
"1717190","1719970"," I may, I've got three or four merchandise pieces."
"1720930","1723330"," If you want to see them, I'll try to show them to you guys this morning. "
"1724030","1724750"," They're kind of funny."
"1727110","1728270"," So we can figure something out."
"1728370","1728930"," We'll talk about it. "
"1729110","1729790"," I guess at some point."
"1730510","1731690"," A good job in the new bot, Winky."
"1734700","1735160"," Yeah. "
"1735320","1736400"," I gotta move ahead and move some stuff."
"1737280","1739900"," Do you see about a bit there continuous sell off?"
"1741670","1744230"," I hope the fuck that we sell off to 396."
"1744770","1749670"," A criminal spokesperson here says that Russia's main goal is to ensure that nuclear parity"
"1749670","1750930"," continues to be respected. "
"1751930","1753810"," If so, who was asking?"
"1754270","1755590"," Kamarata alone was asking."
"1756410","1757730"," I'd really like to see us."
"1758390","1765590"," Well, what do I think is going to happen to Kamarata alone saying do you see us, it's slowing to"
"1765590","1765890"," a yes. "
"1766130","1766590"," I see this."
"1766970","1767830"," I see a slowing."
"1768190","1770170"," I see that this is probably a Bible dip here. "
"1770810","1773010"," I know it doesn't show it right now, but it probably is."
"1775110","1779610"," And you're probably going to get the usual bullshit, right?"
"1779770","1782390"," You'll get the usual bullshit into the minutes."
"1783690","1787450"," And then you actually, you sell the minutes then you buy after the minutes are done. "
"1788470","1789810"," The hope would be we get 396."
"1789810","1796690"," If we could get lower for like a capitulation move and that's the other part of this is that"
"1796690","1806250"," frustrated me with totally frustrated me with this nonsense as being sold is in the"
"1806250","1808350"," best world in my world."
"1809210","1816890"," I like buying shit cheap, so I would love, love, love, love to see some kind of dip even below"
"1816890","1817190"," 396. "
"1817190","1821410"," If he'll blast it down like another 70 points for like five minutes."
"1822510","1826170"," I'm game on on that because we'd be we'd finally be oversold."
"1826950","1829830"," There'd be no choice but to buy a dip at some point. "
"1830050","1830490"," We're not yet."
"1830710","1833230"," No choice but to buy a dip at some point."
"1833450","1834630"," There'd have to be something that we don't know. "
"1835730","1841410"," So if we can actually get anywhere down here, you know, for like whether this is today or tomorrow,"
"1841410","1847730"," then have some kind of quick fast blast down to buy the by the dip."
"1847890","1850930"," I'd be stoked down here because I'm safer."
"1851170","1859410"," It's safer for me to I miss actually missed the last dip to truly buy was in December and we're"
"1859410","1864670"," now in February 21st when we have bought tips but not with with not with weight. "
"1865050","1871730"," And so if there's any chance for me to get that trade on, I'll be all over that trade."
"1871730","1875230"," So I welcome this to some extent."
"1878520","1879400"," It isn't moving. "
"1879820","1882960"," Nothing in this channel is financial advice, consult your own financial advisor."
"1883640","1884640"," Thank you for that one too."
"1884760","1884920"," Winky. "
"1885160","1886120"," You're the man, bro."
"1887640","1888920"," S3 kind of holding for now."
"1889140","1889460"," I was moving. "
"1889680","1889860"," Good morning."
"1890000","1890440"," Good morning."
"1890620","1890780"," Torque. "
"1890860","1891400"," How are you?"
"1893600","1894400"," Good morning."

"1898140","1899080"," I'm an excuse. "
"1899540","1900600"," High is 12 watts by."
"1901960","1902920"," 486 puts."
"1904060","1905300"," March 3300 puts. "
"1905960","1906840"," What do we got here?"
"1908520","1909240"," 14 lot."
"1909360","1910800"," March 21 SPX calls."
"1912080","1912840"," 16 lot. "
"1913080","1913720"," 17 March."
"1913980","1914520"," Exel of puts."
"1915080","1915780"," How how?"
"1916580","1917040"," Capital you put on?"
"1917200","1917980"," Will you put Jim Kramer?"
"1918960","1920100"," I can't put Jim Kramer on. "
"1922100","1922760"," Big move."
"1923000","1923920"," This is not financial advice."
"1925260","1926200"," What do we got here?"
"1927160","1927780"," Oh, yeah. "
"1928100","1931500"," So, Winky, you can put the links in here now too, right?"
"1932400","1939240"," You should be able to do links and grant people the opportunity to put links on for like 30 seconds"
"1939240","1941240"," or 60 seconds or something."
"1944120","1944920"," See what that is."
"1945880","1947340"," Am I sure I want to leave YouTube?"
"1948420","1948600"," Yes. "
"1948760","1951340"," EKPM, so that spoke person says I agree with you."
"1951680","1952640"," Oh, hell yeah, brother."
"1952900","1954940"," Progress has been made in resolving the Northern. "
"1955360","1955580"," Nice."
"1955940","1956580"," Nice, Winky."
"1956580","1956700"," Thank you. "
"1956760","1957340"," I saw that link."
"1957460","1963840"," That has been very clear that there are still substantive issues that need to be resolved with the"
"1963840","1964100"," EU."
"1964860","1966920"," And UKPM's tonight spoke person. "
"1966920","1967660"," Yeah, this is all Winky."
"1967820","1971420"," Winky is doing all this cool stuff for resolving talks with the EU."
"1972080","1977220"," And says, I hope Putin reconsiders decision to suspend Russia's participation in a new start to"
"1977220","1978160"," nuclear arms treaty. "
"1979180","1979840"," Hell yeah."
"1986040","1990180"," You might have mentioned that Twitter is a problem."
"1990320","1991200"," Yeah, Twitter is a problem. "
"1992480","1997980"," Twitter is Twitter is a fucking disaster right now."
"1999300","2006600"," So, USO is catching a bit right now."
"2006600","2012660"," If you're looking for something about here, it might be in oil this morning. "
"2012840","2018600"," It's pretty much the most oversold sector within the S&P 500 this morning."
"2019700","2022740"," You probably have questions about meta this morning as well."
"2023700","2025520"," We'll take a look at meta at some point. "
"2025820","2027300"," Let me see meta in the background here."
"2028140","2029900"," See if it's worth buying a dip here in meta."
"2035350","2035910"," Oh, yeah, dude. "
"2036110","2038250"," Meta's about to squeeze face off right now."
"2040150","2041110"," Meta's about to rip."
"2042430","2044510"," So, let's go over and take a look at meta real quick. "
"2050590","2051710"," I would be interested."
"2054050","2055909"," This is beautiful on meta right here."
"2055969","2056710"," I want you to see this. "
"2058489","2060730"," One, two, three tests on meta."
"2061730","2064989"," If meta can get above 174.40 here."
"2070389","2078429"," Could see meta squeeze above 174.72, 174.76 on meta. "
"2078929","2080750"," Just like this nice squeeze back here."
"2081710","2083489"," You could see another one coming up."
"2086389","2088250"," Man, I like meta here definitely. "
"2090030","2092590"," Some of you are the one to get risky on meta."
"2099640","2106960"," Right where price is right now 174.46. If we're able to break above that, there could be a buy"
"2106960","2109180"," here with some tight stops on meta."
"2109940","2113920"," So, currently, right where meta is right now, it's looking very squeezy. "
"2114180","2115280"," But you see this right here."
"2115420","2120040"," I want you to see how we sold down off of this red line right here."
"2120140","2120980"," This is the five minute. "
"2120980","2124820"," You want to make sure of course that we don't do that again, right?"
"2125020","2128960"," You don't want to see us squeeze up and then start to bloodbath down."
"2130100","2135460"," What you want to see is some consolidation and then the one minute come screaming higher and carry"
"2135460","2137840"," that above."
"2138200","2148100"," So, I'd be looking for a run higher and then a check and go on"
"2148100","2148940"," this green box. "
"2148940","2151200"," So, where are we out here in meta?"
"2151440","2156500"," 174.75. We'll go over meta for you right now."
"2159450","2160970"," So, just meta real quick."
"2163990","2165010"," Here's the meta right here. "
"2166230","2169350"," I would like to see, we'll just draw this in so you can see it."
"2173240","2173780"," Right here."
"2177220","2178640"," We guys know how we do this, right?"
"2179620","2189020"," I want to see this move down here, right over there. "
"2191610","2192290"," Right there."
"2192350","2193210"," It's kind of what I want to see."
"2194010","2194990"," Probably a buyer. "
"2195950","2197090"," Probably I'll be a buyer."
"2197470","2198990"," Probably pick up some calls here."
"2209780","2211200"," I'm a buyer above here. "
"2211460","2214480"," So, if you're watching meta and you're like, I want to jump in meta and trade meta."
"2214500","2215620"," I want to make some money."
"2216400","2220200"," You're just waiting for a price to trade above. "
"2221520","2230860"," 175, but you don't want to jump in until it checks this 174.80. You want to make sure you"
"2230860","2234040"," have confirmation to take the trade higher."
"2234900","2240320"," So 174.60 or sorry, 174.25ish on a recheck of the five minute."
"2240580","2244680"," If they can produce that, I'm all game on this trade right here. "
"2244920","2246640"," So, keep your eyes on meta here."
"2247060","2248780"," You don't want to be buying meta down here."
"2249660","2252680"," You don't want to be buying meta when it closes the gap. "
"2253380","2259540"," Just right now, you want to see if meta can come up here and start to squeeze higher just like"
"2259540","2261720"," this squeeze before the opening bell this morning."
"2262780","2265660"," We'll keep an eye on this one as time passes."
"2269270","2271030"," Right back to the spy for you here. "
"2283680","2284620"," Right down there."
"2286140","2286740"," All right."
"2286820","2287660"," What else you got going on?"
"2287780","2288320"," Stacy Friedman. "
"2288640","2288940"," Good morning."
"2289240","2289560"," How are you?"
"2290740","2292220"," Chase still bearish."
"2293700","2294400"," That's hilarious. "
"2295100","2295640"," That's a good one."
"2297200","2298340"," I like that one."
"2304320","2305620"," We're at my shop target. "
"2305780","2306480"," We'll take a look at the shop."
"2306760","2307540"," Let me write that one down."
"2318700","2320680"," Yeah, I'm interested in oil this morning too. "
"2321280","2321640"," Morning."
"2321800","2321920"," Very."
"2322340","2322780"," How are you doing?"
"2324500","2324860"," Panic. "
"2326500","2328780"," Yeah, you know, and that's the problem too, right?"
"2328960","2333400"," Winkie is all you want is like the top called over."
"2333580","2337560"," Well, you want to, you don't want to hear like someone saying the market's going to sell."
"2337740","2338420"," The market's going to sell. "
"2338420","2339300"," The market's going to sell."
"2339440","2341180"," The market's going to sell every day."
"2341340","2344200"," You want to hear when we're rolling over and you want to hear when the bottom is. "
"2344900","2351640"," You don't want to constantly be barraged by top collars or bottom collars."
"2351640","2353200"," You don't want to be either side of that."
"2353600","2355240"," I was thinking about that last night. "
"2355400","2358260"," I was like, I was thinking last night."
"2358260","2360340"," I was like, man, I don't know who has it worse."
"2361140","2368400"," I don't know if the garbage that bears are fed or the garbage that bulls are fed. "
"2370220","2372480"," Which side of that coin is worse?"
"2374240","2375160"," I can't tell."
"2375400","2385200"," I know I saw a short seller ST made a post about how much traction he gets with bearish posts"
"2385940","2390600"," and how you gain followers and view counts with those posts."
"2392600","2401660"," I was trying to decide this weekend if it makes you more money as a content provider to always just"
"2401660","2402640"," say, fuck it. "
"2403360","2404780"," I'm going to sell doom every day."
"2405220","2406520"," I don't care if I'm right or wrong."
"2407720","2410780"," But that is the consumer of doom, especially if you're bearish. "
"2411220","2420160"," The consumer of doom is a more difficult to find out when the actual rollover is."
"2420160","2421480"," How deep does it go?"
"2421960","2422700"," Where do I take profit?"
"2423960","2425160"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"2425620","2429320"," I think it might be more difficult for a bear than it is for a bull. "
"2432570","2434030"," I think it might be."
"2434910","2436510"," Because I think that sells, right?"
"2436670","2436910"," Sizzle."
"2438270","2441630"," Or blood cells rather than the actual rollover. "
"2441850","2451050"," As far as I can tell, you've been calling for a crash since May or June of 2022."
"2453010","2459990"," And then each time we have a bottom, we get told, you know, at the bottom we're told it's going"
"2459990","2460710"," to crash right now."
"2460770","2464590"," Then we're told it's going to crash and it keeps going up and up and up and up. "
"2465770","2467250"," Tops are irrational."
"2467890","2473970"," Even in my own trading when I'm buying put spreads, I have to put even more time."
"2473970","2482990"," And even then, just price-wise, it's hard to, not as successful as I am buying a call spread on"
"2482990","2483610"," and oversold. "
"2483970","2487330"," Because that capitulation move, you're like, yeah, we're fucking done here."
"2489070","2493490"," Like, you know, like when you're at the top, when you're at the top, it can take you two, three"
"2493490","2500630"," iterations of two, three iterations of rotation before the market actually rolls over."
"2503820","2505560"," We should get some cool shit. "
"2505820","2511660"," I think Wiki is able to do some cool stuff where you guys will get, you guys will get, I"
"2511660","2517520"," think you guys will be able to find out how long someone's been a viewer, how long someone's been a"
"2517520","2523540"," member, you'll be able to find out how good someone's track record is by"
"2523540","2533300"," saying people for their quality of their"
"2533300","2534380"," comments, that kind of stuff."
"2534960","2538900"," And there should be some band-up banning, but you can't say these words."
"2539140","2539720"," You can't say this. "
"2539820","2540400"," You can't say that."
"2540780","2547720"," You can't spam the chat with, you know, 50 cap locks, messages and stuff like that."
"2549990","2551090"," What are you guys doing here?"
"2551210","2553370"," Yeah, people that just joined the stream for the first time. "
"2554290","2557770"," New subscribers, people that donate, that kind of stuff will all be highlighted."
"2557770","2563190"," I got some mugs for it."
"2563270","2563410"," Oh, dude. "
"2563530","2563690"," Hold on."
"2563750","2565390"," We go back up here and see what you guys are saying here."
"2569670","2572250"," Doing great since I showed up the red box and Friday right on John. "
"2576030","2576890"," Congrats, John M."
"2577290","2577790"," Right on, brother."
"2582050","2582590"," Oh, man."
"2582690","2583410"," You guys are awesome. "
"2583770","2583850"," Stream."
"2584110","2586070"," Thanks, Wiki, for the follow Captain James."
"2587770","2589050"," Vic, she's a rising baby. "
"2592920","2593280"," Oh, dude."
"2593520","2594500"," Troy, you should have hit me up, man."
"2595440","2596760"," You should have totally hit me up. "
"2596760","2600700"," Hey, do you want to go see the Red Sox, man?"
"2601020","2602500"," Detroit, opening game or what?"
"2602920","2603220"," Troy."
"2603900","2607580"," If you have a chance, hit me up in the chat."
"2607780","2610860"," I haven't bought socks tickets or Detroit Tiger tickets yet. "
"2611540","2613240"," You want to get some seats and go out, man?"
"2613620","2614960"," I'll totally hook up with you, brother."
"2616000","2619980"," We can go out with, I think the first game's on Thursday and then Saturday, Sunday."
"2621540","2625180"," We can catch some seats and head downtown and hang out. "
"2625180","2626700"," I'd love to meet up with you, man."
"2628680","2630080"," I appreciate it, Winky, bro."
"2633160","2635620"," John, you're more than welcome to repost whatever you want. "
"2637820","2642460"," If you have any problems reposting, no news, just let Winky know."
"2642620","2646940"," He can make exceptions for trusted people in the stream."
"2648380","2650200"," I'm sure Winky knows that you're trusted. "
"2651820","2656720"," If you have any problems, if any of you are trusted members of the stream, if you've been here"
"2656720","2665640"," since day one, and you have issues, try to contact either myself or Winky and DM and say, hey, I"
"2665640","2670280"," usually post this and I'm getting blocked and we'll try to get you guys what you need."
"2676240","2677040"," Chairman Z."
"2678060","2679120"," Way to the poo."
"2682880","2684080"," You got to be kidding me, dude. "
"2686610","2687330"," Are you serious?"
"2688430","2688910"," 16k?"
"2689890","2690370"," What?"
"2694710","2697410"," So Peter Zell saying I should move to Twitch."
"2698830","2703290"," Tomorrow or the next day, if I have the chance, we will be simulcasting on Twitch."
"2704630","2706850"," We're going to try to build out Twitch in the background. "
"2707230","2712370"," You'll start seeing me on Twitch and YouTube on a simulcast."
"2713850","2719250"," In the next couple of days, the basic package is there."
"2720090","2722230"," So you'll see a simulcast on both. "
"2724480","2726060"," Thanks for asking, Peter."
"2728700","2730280"," Do you guys see the merch?"
"2731260","2733480"," Do you guys want me to show it to you?"
"2733780","2734940"," It's kind of fucking funny."
"2735820","2737840"," I got a Mike Murray hat for people. "
"2739680","2745360"," It's got a little thing in the side that says MB and it's got an outline of them."
"2745940","2747440"," I think it's on the left-hand side."
"2747440","2751000"," And then the front, it says you don't know how short I am. "
"2752400","2753840"," It's almost looks like a supreme."
"2754200","2760060"," I don't know if I have the right lettering font, but I want to do it with supreme lettering font."
"2760400","2761700"," So it's like a Mike Murray hat. "
"2764110","2766630"," And then I've got a couple others done."
"2766790","2772710"," I don't know if I should show you guys just yet, but they're not like Captain Jim James stuff."
"2772870","2778410"," It's like market stuff so that you guys can wear them anywhere. "
"2778410","2781230"," And I've got some smart people stuff."
"2782130","2784190"," That's what I like to call it smart people stuff."
"2786070","2792930"," Like gamma formulas or not formulas, but functions like gamma functions that are written out. "
"2793990","2795550"," But it doesn't say what it is."
"2795730","2800190"," So if you're like a nerd and you're walking down the street and someone knows what a gamma function"
"2800190","2803930"," is, they'll just be like, ah, yeah, I know what that is."
"2807050","2808150"," So really cool. "
"2808290","2809230"," It actually looks really nice."
"2809870","2812250"," And it's not like it's not merch."
"2812490","2814150"," It's like Captain Jim James. "
"2814530","2817910"," It's just like kind of neat stuff that some of it's like really undercover."
"2818290","2819010"," I got a bear koozy."
"2820490","2822410"," I got a bear koozy that's out there. "
"2822730","2826550"," I think it's I think it says it's got Wojack."
"2828110","2835750"," And he's all fucked up and it says it says I've been waiting or I've been waiting for the car."
"2835750","2835930"," I'm like that. "
"2837070","2837930"," It's really cool."
"2845070","2845750"," Oh, dude."
"2845890","2848370"," Rocket ship mugs with a crusty mano lobster in the front. "
"2848370","2848750"," Hold on."
"2848890","2849250"," Hold on."
"2849890","2850730"," Rocket ship. "
"2851550","2852030"," Mugs."
"2854710","2855190"," Crusty."
"2856050","2856530"," Lobsterman. "
"2859250","2859730"," Lobsterman."
"2863620","2864340"," All right."
"2864480","2864840"," Here we go. "
"2867510","2867750"," Yeah."
"2867810","2868150"," We got chat."
"2868370","2869030"," Man's going on. "
"2873090","2874550"," We got some cool shit going on."
"2875830","2879750"," That bids for six month bills total four spot nine billion dollars."
"2881680","2882720"," Coach K, my brother. "
"2882960","2883440"," How are you, man?"
"2884040","2885940"," Thanks for watching this program last month."
"2886000","2886840"," I appreciate it."
"2889140","2893100"," That bids for three month bills total six spot one billion dollars. "
"2895240","2895820"," Yeah, man."
"2896020","2897860"," Just I'm on a trade right now."
"2897900","2900500"," I'm just chilling waiting for waiting for a nice little. "
"2900660","2904220"," Whether we grind down lower here or we start to roll higher."
"2904700","2907480"," If we can get above this white line, we're still bearish here."
"2907480","2908900"," Do you see this white line right here?"
"2910320","2913840"," This is going, this is for coach K."
"2914460","2915720"," So you see this white line right here?"
"2916360","2919380"," If you want to get bullish at any points, you want to see. "
"2920640","2921660"," Here, I'll just show you."
"2922540","2923900"," It's just like every day, right?"
"2924520","2936040"," If you want to get bullish here and buy a dip, you're looking for, you're"
"2936040","2939400"," looking for something like this, but then you're looking for price to trade higher."
"2940460","2947060"," So you want to see price come above the one minute, come above the five minute and then test that"
"2947060","2948200"," one minute and come higher. "
"2949080","2954460"," So if you want to take that trade right there, it doesn't matter if this happens here or if it"
"2954460","2955400"," happens down here."
"2956420","2958240"," If it happens down here, it doesn't matter."
"2958340","2963800"," If you're looking for that trade to go higher, you're waiting for this kind of a setup right here. "
"2964660","2966300"," And it will show itself at some point."
"2966300","2968420"," It doesn't matter how much we sell off."
"2969420","2972940"," But until that happens, there's no bull trade on spy right now. "
"2975650","2976450"," It's a good morning, brother."
"2978600","2981240"," How to connect the bots API services to look shit up?"
"2981360","2981740"," Yeah, dude."
"2982440","2984920"," There is API services, Winky. "
"2985660","2986440"," There is."
"2986780","2987740"," And I'll try to find."
"2988540","2992820"," I was reading about API services last night. "
"2993360","2997640"," I'll try to find the link on that, like a paper on that for you, brother."
"3003850","3005770"," I was reading about API."
"3006490","3011370"," And I was also reading about web hooks for the bots. "
"3011650","3012990"," Supposedly you can do web hooks as well."
"3013310","3018170"," So I'm assuming that would be an API with web hooks and then command line and you can get whatever"
"3018170","3018810"," data you want."
"3021720","3022760"," Dude, Winky is the man. "
"3023680","3025900"," I talked to Winky outside of the stream all the time."
"3026280","3027260"," The guy is Hela Smart."
"3028700","3029420"," Hela Smart. "
"3036340","3038220"," Today's gigantic gamble would be goog."
"3038400","3040080"," Capsy scotas pending news bomb."
"3040940","3044080"," Maybe we can get a Hagerty to drop some info on that. "
"3045840","3049760"," Lord Zach and Dr. Williams self-blaying off tens of thousands of freeloading coders."
"3050280","3051380"," He kept the sensors."
"3055110","3056010"," Let me see here. "
"3060970","3062230"," We can see things catch up with me, guys."
"3063970","3065610"," So we haven't done discord yet."
"3065770","3067130"," We're working on discord right now. "
"3067750","3071150"," So you should see the bots."
"3071690","3073330"," We're trying to revamp discord as well."
"3073590","3074490"," We're just not there yet. "
"3075350","3081730"," We're trying to get to the discord so that I can start to let people back into the discord so"
"3081730","3082990"," people have a better experience."
"3088280","3090320"," Dude, you guys don't see cocaine in the background."
"3090900","3091900"," I moved to Michael J."
"3092140","3092460"," Barry shit. "
"3093320","3094840"," You guys don't see Michael J."
"3097020","3098240"," Barry in a more prominent place."
"3104830","3106550"," So here, hold on a second here."
"3109710","3110610"," Let me see here. "

"3895150","3896090"," Captain speed pick."
"3896270","3898410"," It's got 36% of bits at high. "
"3898930","3901930"," So the six month bits of cover, two to 71, two to 71."
"3901930","3904090"," New apply Tesla and medical ones are here."
"3904830","3908330"," The US sells $53 billion of six month bills. "
"3909030","3909270"," Nope."
"3909470","3911110"," So Tesla's not a buy."
"3911350","3912370"," Met is not a buy either. "
"3912830","3914550"," Tesla or Meta never got above."
"3915250","3915830"," It wasn't looking."
"3916010","3918510"," So Meta never got above 175. "
"3918830","3919870"," It traded below."
"3920070","3921330"," It was rejected on the one minute."
"3921730","3923210"," Let's take a look at Tesla real quick. "
"3923830","3925250"," We do a market update for you guys."
"3926170","3928030"," So yeah, Tesla's not a buy here."
"3928030","3929150"," A lot here. "
"3930690","3931990"," No reason to buy Tesla."
"3932210","3934850"," Oh, maybe Tesla might be a buy here soon."
"3935810","3937150"," Let me take a look at Tesla real quick. "
"3940400","3941800"," You know what?"
"3941980","3942960"," I don't like Tesla either."
"3944100","3945440"," Let's take a look at Tesla real quick."
"3946560","3947680"," You guys want to see Tesla?"
"3953210","3954970"," Let me see me bring Tesla for you guys. "
"3958340","3959360"," Okay, so Tesla."
"3960340","3961700"," Let's have a look at Tesla here."
"3962840","3965380"," See if we can bring this down a little bit more. "
"3965380","3967760"," Oh, that's much better."
"3970760","3971380"," Excuse me."
"3972160","3974240"," My throat still hurts from last week. "
"3976940","3978540"," So let's just take a look at Tesla here."
"3988580","3989920"," So we had a look down below here."
"3990040","3991740"," This is the way to see the white. "
"3993340","3995420"," The way to see the white that's down below there."
"3995880","3999140"," And it still hasn't come into a bottom at all yet."
"3999920","4001540"," If you look at that white here. "
"4002320","4003220"," This way right here."
"4003280","4005840"," It still hasn't bottomed out currently."
"4007080","4010620"," And furthermore, just on Tesla, looking at Tesla here, right?"
"4011840","4015840"," We've been attacking this orange line right here, right?"
"4016020","4016580"," This is your weekly. "
"4016860","4019300"," This is a very emotional place for bulls."
"4020360","4024360"," They want to buy or bulls and their view wants to buy the dip here."
"4024360","4032260"," But the fact that we've run a ground of this, you can see right here on, let's see here. "
"4032260","4037560"," We broke above here on February 8th, right?"
"4038220","4038940"," Rejected above."
"4039800","4041180"," Rejected above again."
"4041680","4042640"," Retested down below. "
"4042960","4043880"," Retested down below."
"4044760","4046400"," Market conditions are still weak."
"4047120","4048940"," We also have above on Tesla. "
"4048940","4056120"," This is where we talked about if we were still in a corrective pattern on Tesla."
"4057140","4060960"," Where sellers would come into the market to sell Tesla."
"4062520","4066320"," And we knew that people would take profit like even myself, right?"
"4066580","4069280"," You take profit on Tesla or you hedge Tesla. "
"4070200","4071180"," So you only have a choice."
"4071240","4072100"," You only have one choice, right?"
"4072180","4075260"," Or if you bought down below at 100 bucks, 120, 130."
"4076040","4078020"," That you'd be hedging here, right?"
"4078020","4085420"," So if you weren't a buyer of Tesla down at $100 or $130, this doesn't concern you. "
"4085680","4087280"," Nobody cares about top buyers."
"4087800","4091060"," Nobody cares about bottom sellers either, right?"
"4091220","4091500"," Nobody cares."
"4091900","4092580"," I'll be honest with you. "
"4092580","4101140"," If you're a trader investor and you're a bottom seller or you're a top buyer, regular traders and"
"4101140","4102500"," investors don't care about it."
"4102520","4103240"," You'll be honest with you."
"4104380","4112460"," So if you're looking for what did you do back here and even back over here, you took profit from"
"4112460","4116680"," your bottom buying of Tesla or you hedged Tesla. "
"4117080","4122140"," So if you're a hedger of Tesla, you're making tons of money, right?"
"4122340","4124340"," If you stayed long on Tesla, you're making tons of money."
"4125340","4131479"," If you're looking for a bottom to buy on Tesla, we talked about Tesla prior."
"4131479","4133540"," I'm going to make this screen larger for you. "
"4134380","4138279"," Is this the place to buy Tesla currently?"
"4138840","4143500"," On an intraday, this is getting weaker here."
"4143580","4144899"," This weekly is getting weaker."
"4145899","4152680"," So if you're just intraday, if you're looking to buy Tesla, just like Meta earlier, you want to see"
"4152680","4156340"," Tesla break above some key levels here. "
"4156340","4160680"," So I'm going to show you two things if you're a dip buyer on Tesla."
"4162040","4166920"," So you want to get above, let me look at this slide this over here just a little bit."
"4169540","4172779"," You want to get above two zero one and some change. "
"4173640","4176979"," You can probably trade it to two zero three seventy."
"4178859","4181340"," But even then, it's not really worth it."
"4181340","4187439"," It's not really worth maybe it is for you the worth the trade to trade this might be worth it. "
"4187800","4195300"," But the reality is you want to see Tesla trade higher than this two oh one and two oh three."
"4195460","4201360"," And believe it or not, you want to get above right here."
"4202640","4204520"," You want to get above two oh five. "
"4204740","4206340"," So is there a trade for five points?"
"4206560","4209580"," Maybe is this the bottom for Tesla?"
"4210400","4215580"," It's not showing that it's bottom and we're still selling that we're still selling the news above."
"4216780","4222460"," Now, if you're able to get above these three levels right here and put some work together in here,"
"4222600","4226000"," you could possibly make another attack for that 220 above here."
"4226380","4230940"," But the truth is in a higher time frame, even for today and to tomorrow. "
"4232840","4237620"," I'd love to buy Tesla at 181 maybe."
"4238600","4239200"," That's right."
"4239240","4240400"," I'd like to buy Tesla 181. "
"4241880","4243660"," I'm not really interested here."
"4243740","4243940"," 197."
"4244700","4245680"," I have no interest here. "
"4245820","4247660"," And I'll show you on a larger time frame what I'm talking about."
"4249660","4252080"," Like where my interest lies on Tesla."
"4253960","4263760"," And I'll just delete where my interest lies here in Tesla is is multifold here. "
"4264140","4266120"," Now, this is an hourly chart on Tesla."
"4266120","4268840"," And I'll show you why I'm not interested in this."
"4269540","4274860"," You can see we traded above this major resistance here and the sky is the limit up here, right?"
"4275760","4277740"," You can kind of see that the sky is the limit here. "
"4278080","4283280"," To be honest, I'd really like to see Tesla come down here by a dip, right?"
"4284200","4286560"," But even this trade right here is still a small trade."
"4287220","4290020"," All this in here is volatility, right?"
"4290280","4291940"," I don't need any of this noise down here."
"4291940","4299540"," I would really like to see the price of Tesla get bought and then see some kind of consolidation"
"4299540","4303240"," above 220. "
"4303880","4305180"," I mean, that's really what I want to see."
"4305700","4307680"," I'm really am a buyer above here."
"4308000","4310400"," And that's not even in the consolidation. "
"4311360","4316080"," It's the next trip higher is where I'd like to be a buyer on Tesla."
"4316360","4319040"," Otherwise, and I'll explain why to you here."
"4319040","4327660"," Because otherwise, if we trade below, if price trades below on Tesla here. "
"4328740","4331040"," So this is the yellow line."
"4331140","4331960"," This is the orange line."
"4332080","4333440"," The blue line comes back down here. "
"4333980","4336160"," And price actually holds below right here."
"4336680","4338420"," So price actually holds down here."
"4339280","4341180"," The correction is not over on Tesla. "
"4341820","4344440"," I'm actually going to be looking for Tesla to trade down and test."
"4346300","4350140"," Possibly the $95 in the day that gap never got closed."
"4350760","4355000"," And then $65 is below there, right?"
"4355240","4357600"," So I'm actually a buyer much lower on Tesla. "
"4358560","4362360"," So if price can get above here, sure, I'll buy Tesla."
"4363040","4364420"," We can take the market higher."
"4365200","4369560"," Maybe we can trade 430 something like that on SPX and spy. "
"4369840","4373500"," But if we don't get up there, it's just a matter of going down again, right?"
"4373500","4379440"," And you guys have had my outlook in the market now for some time."
"4379620","4380800"," We're talking months here, right?"
"4381840","4390700"," So Tesla, all by itself, Tesla, my view on the market on Tesla hasn't changed."
"4390760","4394340"," None of it's changed since day one. "
"4394620","4402660"," So just looking at Tesla, right?"
"4402660","4405160"," But you saw the basic outline of Tesla."
"4406380","4409540"," I'm trying to buy dips on a market turn."
"4410000","4412000"," I'm trying to turn from bearish. "
"4412400","4414800"," So I started getting bearish in late 2020."
"4415320","4418280"," I'm on fin to it and I'm like, I'm selling out of all my stocks."
"4419260","4421260"," 2021, I only traded the spy. "
"4422720","4424820"," 2022, we sold the market, right?"
"4425380","4427840"," We thought they were going to sell it November, September and November."
"4428480","4430280"," They didn't do it until December, January."
"4430940","4433080"," They started selling underneath the market. "
"4434280","4438100"," 2022 was the sell the market stance, your bearish stance in the market."
"4439040","4444300"," As we came into the end of 2022, you start to look for that last leg down."
"4444920","4447880"," It doesn't matter if it happens first quarter of 2023. "
"4448340","4454200"," It doesn't matter if it happens in the summer with maybe the debt ceiling is what they use as an"
"4454200","4454520"," excuse."
"4455100","4460580"," Could be December, September, October, could be January of 2024."
"4460880","4466120"," So if that's the viewpoint that we're going to trade sideways and up to the right, we're going to"
"4466120","4470100"," be in the trough and we're looking for that last capitulation move down. "
"4470520","4475320"," If you're asking me as a testable, what I'm looking for is I'm looking for two things."
"4476520","4478520"," I'm looking to only buy major dips."
"4478700","4480460"," So I'm looking for like $65. "
"4481440","4485860"," I'm looking for $95 to add to a test position."
"4486860","4492440"," If I'm looking to take Tesla long again, I'm looking for right now, currently, price-wise, I'm"
"4492440","4496280"," looking for above, I'm looking for above, we look over here."
"4497240","4501500"," I'm looking for above 221 right now. "
"4501680","4502200"," That's the truth."
"4503480","4505680"," For me to be buying Tesla, that's what I'm looking for."
"4505680","4512040"," At the end of most bear markets, we have this trough and then we have a capitulation inside of that"
"4512040","4512260"," trough. "
"4513260","4516380"," So for me, that's when I get bullish on Tesla again."
"4517340","4527000"," For me to get bullish on Tesla, right now, I'll give you the numbers one more time."
"4528460","4536600"," For what you look, I'll give you actual price targets here and I'll give you just a second here. "
"4540090","4541590"," So Tesla price right here."
"4541650","4551390"," If Tesla can get above 201.32, you can trade that to 203"
"4551390","4561170"," in some change, like 203.36. And then 205.61. I'll"
"4561170","4565980"," click over there so you can see it right here."
"4567060","4568400"," And you can see it right here. "
"4570160","4572120"," So you can mark this off for yourself."
"4572800","4575680"," You need to stay above 201 in some change."
"4576800","4581780"," You can then trade it to 203.51 and I would not be caught dead in here. "
"4582680","4591020"," And then you've got 205.65. But truthfully, if you're looking at this right now, this is just"
"4591020","4596260"," another place for teeing off."
"4596800","4600520"," It's just another place to be teeing off and selling down for sellers."
"4600960","4605320"," Sellers are in charge here at 255 in some change. "
"4606620","4612040"," If you want to trade this and not take on all this risk, you'd be looking for trade above."
"4612040","4614100"," Matter of fact, a bunch of squeeze above this."
"4614680","4623660"," Let's say you squeeze above 206.60. There'll probably be some time that it'll take for a move"
"4623660","4625200"," higher from this to that 220. "
"4627020","4630500"," Or back above again to 220."
"4631200","4635020"," It's a 221.30. This is the meat of the trade in here."
"4635520","4641580"," And this is where bulls get caught, right?"
"4646240","4649200"," Let me see if I can switch back to the main stream here quickly and easily. "
"4655290","4656850"," Put that back there for you."
"4662520","4665180"," Yeah, so I've got a shirt with that too."
"4665500","4672720"," I've got a chart, but it's not coming out nicely on a shirt as of yet. "
"4672720","4673920"," I have to do a better quality."
"4676840","4677780"," You don't buy a Tesla."
"4678840","4679880"," Let me talk about this every week. "
"4681120","4682260"," It's always the same."
"4682260","4684480"," It's always the same."
"4684560","4685180"," It's always the same. "
"4685360","4687160"," It's like you buying Tesla."
"4687420","4688460"," No, no, no."
"4688840","4689160"," You buying Tesla?"
"4689380","4689580"," Yes. "
"4690100","4691120"," I don't think you should buy a Tesla."
"4691360","4692100"," Well, I am."
"4694180","4694920"," What are you doing?"
"4694980","4695560"," I'm selling Tesla. "
"4696200","4697820"," Or buying a hedge against Tesla."
"4698080","4698780"," Why are you doing that?"
"4699060","4699440"," We're going up."
"4699620","4700360"," I'm like, no, no. "
"4701580","4702360"," I'm probably selling here."
"4705570","4707390"," So spy winning the one minute currently."
"4708430","4710870"," Maybe a quick fast trade on the spy here. "
"4711970","4719270"," Let's see if we can get a trade higher here to 401.59. I'm going to look for some calls"
"4719270","4719650"," here."
"4725170","4726030"," I'm going to excite here."
"4735720","4737920"," Look at how juicy cheap these calls are. "
"4742620","4744120"," I'm looking at 401s."
"4744920","4746480"," Sorry, 401s are a dollar too."
"4748180","4749220"," Hold on a second here. "
"4755050","4756810"," So I'm going to sum 401s."
"4756930","4758070"," They're $1 currently."
"4759270","4761330"," We'll see if we can hold above here. "
"4766490","4768730"," Just keep my eyes on spy in the background."
"4780900","4787700"," 401.69. Yeah, 401.69 is where I'm looking to take this trade."
"4790680","4791700"," That's right here. "
"4792620","4795540"," So I'm going to change this one here."
"4796680","4802080"," I'm going to put a box above 401.69. Right there."
"4810600","4813680"," Some long on spy right now. "
"4814680","4817000"," You can speed up your playback here."
"4817980","4824680"," I'm going to price target above 401.69. I have long calls."
"4827570","4835950"," PT.401.69. Save right here. "
"4843350","4843990"," Baby arms."
"4844610","4845390"," Die bears die."
"4846110","4849310"," That's a good one too. "
"4855510","4857090"," Let me see what you guys are posting here."
"4858770","4860370"," Yeah, that's how it did really well."
"4862250","4863730"," Yeah, I'm on calls right now. "
"4864270","4865090"," Hit that like button."
"4865210","4865850"," Appreciate it, Avery."
"4866670","4867150"," Hey, very. "
"4874860","4876440"," No, I'm taking the money right up here."
"4877060","4878180"," I'm taking the money right here."
"4878600","4882940"," PT.401.69. I'm in 401c's. "
"4897730","4902500"," And if anything, I'm looking for a role here afterwards."
"4902500","4905520"," And we're looking for a squeeze higher."
"4906080","4907760"," Roll back down and then a retest. "
"4908240","4910120"," Maybe try to buy one more here."
"4910960","4912620"," If we can trade above here."
"4913720","4915600"," And the white line can match up. "
"4915920","4917620"," So I'll show you guys what I'm looking for here."
"4919400","4921100"," I'll draw in crayons for you."
"4924700","4926360"," You're looking for this right here. "
"4929150","4930610"," You're looking for this right here."
"4931650","4932350"," Hold on."
"4937140","4938840"," I'm looking for that right there. "
"4942420","4944160"," Let me get this right here."
"4945100","4946040"," Right there."
"4947080","4951200"," And then I'm looking for price to continue higher on this white line. "
"4952440","4954760"," Squeeze up, recheck."
"4954980","4958060"," And if it stays above here, I'll take a second set of calls right here."
"4958640","4964320"," Now, if we start to sell off in this white line right now, right, I have to have stops down"
"4964320","4964860"," below here. "
"4964980","4965560"," Does that make sense?"
"4967480","4969280"," The stops right here for my trade."
"4971840","4978120"," If these sellers come back in and try to do a tag lower, right, tag that bottom down below here"
"4978120","4980560"," at 400, I'll get stopped out of my trade."
"4980820","4981360"," Does that make sense?"
"4982480","4984340"," A second trade is above right here. "
"4984480","4985340"," First trade is right here."
"4985640","4988480"," Actually, I think I bought down there, but we're not."
"4988560","4989260"," Maybe I bought right here. "
"4989380","4989740"," Can I remember?"
"4990820","4991540"," Does that make sense?"
"4993200","4996360"," Now, if we begin to roll over here, I want to show you what that looks like."
"4996360","4999400"," See how right here?"
"4999500","5000060"," We traded higher."
"5000940","5002180"," Rejected, sent lower. "
"5002880","5003540"," Traded higher."
"5003800","5004920"," Rejected, sent lower."
"5005800","5006960"," Rejected, sent lower. "
"5007200","5009340"," And they're going to try to send this down one more time."
"5009560","5014340"," So if they get underneath, if they get underneath, there's nothing you can do."
"5014480","5016280"," Now, there's one thing going here for bulls. "
"5016940","5019320"," You can see this one minute coming up."
"5019800","5022320"," You can see this one minute coming up as well."
"5023480","5026440"," So just be careful this last capitulation move lower. "
"5027320","5029620"," You might have to re-add down below here."
"5030580","5033140"," Right down here is where the capitulation move would be."
"5057700","5059100"," Yeah, that's where the safe trade is. "
"5059280","5062440"," I mean, the safe trade is the one over five crossover."
"5062940","5065340"," I'm just trying to take trade between the one and the five right here."
"5065980","5067100"," Just that trade right there. "
"5067940","5070080"," I'll buy some more calls down here, too, if I need to."
"5070160","5071140"," You take four minutes to cleverly."
"5071240","5071660"," I'll buy 400. "
"5072040","5073920"," That's what continues between teams."
"5074460","5076020"," We remain laser focused on."
"5076020","5079040"," Finding a solution that works for the people of Northern Ireland. "
"5079280","5081820"," There's like, I want to get underneath this 400 so bad."
"5082340","5084060"," I want to get way down here."
"5084780","5086120"," I want to sell that 396. "
"5089080","5091300"," Please, please, please sell that 396."
"5100160","5102200"," Yeah, it's interesting that he's in Poland, right?"
"5103020","5108000"," Isn't that where Russia said they're going to invade Mexico?"
"5114120","5121240"," Yeah, I think there's a squeeze here."
"5121320","5122900"," I think we're coming into it at some point. "
"5123180","5123720"," It could be wrong."
"5123860","5127580"," There's still more selling here."
"5127860","5133340"," If I have to add, I will, but I'd like to see. "
"5135520","5138480"," I think this is somewhere bottom here, 400 somewhere in there."
"5138760","5140360"," I think there's one to see."
"5141220","5145560"," If you squeeze higher, at least some kind of clothes under here. "
"5145620","5145940"," It'd be good."
"5146480","5147940"," Productive for tomorrow would be nice."
"5148740","5149420"," Something like that. "
"5163930","5166590"," Yeah, I've got a month 401c's right now."
"5171510","5172850"," Closer to being in the money."
"5176070","5178030"," Closer to not losing my ass in that trade. "
"5179290","5180570"," Closer to not being reprised."
"5180830","5181230"," Good questions."
"5184190","5189470"," Higher chance if I add to them that they'll be a push by Algos at some point. "
"5190510","5194410"," So if you see Algos on 404, they might move up the chain at some point."
"5195070","5196010"," And they'll help me to go higher."
"5196330","5201130"," So if you see Algos on 404, they might move up the chain at some point. "
"5201130","5201990"," And they'll help me to go higher."
"5203310","5204950"," So if we tag down here, 400, right?"
"5205250","5207610"," Let's say you tag to the capitulation move down here."
"5208430","5212550"," And then you've got your high price target of 401 right here, right?"
"5214350","5216050"," A better chance of making my money. "
"5216050","5221130"," The farther we get away from 402, the farther we get away from actually coming in the money to 402,"
"5221250","5221630"," right?"
"5222170","5225510"," If we trade down here, 402 starts to look like it's unachievable."
"5226110","5227810"," So a lot more room to have to make up."
"5229110","5230150"," Something closer in the money. "
"5234740","5235200"," Yeah, exactly."
"5235500","5236360"," That's a basic answer, right?"
"5237000","5237820"," I don't have to un-fuck myself."
"5238480","5241780"," I don't have to re-position myself. "
"5246880","5247300"," That's somewhere near."
"5247400","5247900"," We're slowing down."
"5253040","5254240"," Bears do want to get under 400. "
"5254560","5255840"," Here's that 400 mark right here."
"5256540","5259340"," If bears can close today under 400, it'd be great."
"5260720","5262440"," I would really like to see. "
"5263280","5264260"," There was S1."
"5265200","5267440"," So we broke under the 404, right?"
"5267620","5269100"," So bears, good job completion."
"5270440","5274760"," You know, on the best end would be for bears to, well, not the best end, but. "
"5275820","5278240"," Bears would really like to get underneath here, right?"
"5278540","5280660"," Close under this in the day, but I doubt it."
"5280740","5281820"," I think you get a squeeze higher."
"5282540","5284120"," Maybe the sell off into the bell. "
"5285260","5286860"," Some kind of squeeze in there."
"5288100","5289860"," And then a failure by bulls."
"5290480","5291220"," And then we trade underneath. "
"5291700","5292480"," I'd love this."
"5292600","5293660"," If we can get this close today."
"5294500","5296520"," I'm picturing things so stronger than anticipated. "
"5296940","5298900"," Chinese recovery will benefit."
"5299320","5300880"," That would be, that would be prime."
"5301380","5302480"," Because we all know what happens, right?"
"5303260","5304060"," Come into like that. "
"5304180","5306760"," We sell the minutes and then we squeeze the fuck out of the market."
"5310220","5311680"," Bears know how that happens, right?"
"5312100","5313900"," They're like, I'm fucking short into the minutes."
"5314680","5316760"," We squeeze up like 70 points. "
"5319430","5320850"," And you're like, fuck."
"5327200","5330860"," Is the red bar and book map strong support?"
"5331120","5331700"," No, fuck no."
"5332380","5335360"," The only, the only strong support you need to know here is this. "
"5335660","5336140"," Here I'll show you."
"5337940","5343990"," The only strong support you need to know is I'll show it to you."
"5346290","5347010"," It's ratings. "
"5347330","5351550"," It says, I do not see as strong rebound in China's growth as in 2021."
"5351550","5356210"," Because of tighter global one or two policy all way on demand for Chinese exports."
"5356670","5361410"," So the only strong support you need to know about here is right here. "
"5362050","5363810"," See a line that's strong support."
"5364150","5364450"," See that?"
"5364930","5367130"," This orange line is strong support down here."
"5367970","5370490"," This is a very emotional level right here. "
"5371230","5371750"," 39734."
"5373070","5377330"," And I put this here because you don't tend to see us trade right into it."
"5377330","5381690"," Russian foreign ministry says Moscow will continue to comply with constant. "
"5381970","5382750"," I don't want to listen to them."
"5382810","5384170"," There's no need listening to people talking."
"5384890","5385970"," It means nothing. "
"5388430","5391170"," Sometimes you'll come down here and you'll tag it to a T."
"5391810","5396650"," But we don't, we're not, if we were in the minutes right now and we blasted down here, I would"
"5396650","5400950"," tend to be like, yeah, we'll probably hit 397 right now."
"5400950","5402930"," But where we don't have minutes until tomorrow."
"5404890","5407930"," You'll, you'll tend not to slam into it. "
"5408510","5409390"," You need like an event."
"5409870","5411650"," You need like a reason to slam into it."
"5411690","5413370"," Otherwise it's, it's pretty key support. "
"5414270","5416510"," So do I see us coming down here right now?"
"5416670","5417150"," Probably not."
"5417630","5419570"," Do I see us coming down here tomorrow?"
"5419950","5420430"," Fuck yes."
"5420730","5425690"," I think yesterday on Fintuit for last night in Fintuit, I was like, it wouldn't be caught dead down"
"5425690","5428050"," at four or three ninety six. "
"5428770","5430430"," I was like, it wouldn't be caught dead short down here."
"5430430","5433950"," I would be taking profit down here."
"5434970","5441270"," And then if we broke through finally three ninety six, I'd be like, fuck yeah, it's game on again. "
"5441630","5443250"," Warm money for the downside down here."
"5443890","5446570"," This is, this is leg number two."
"5448980","5450380"," So this is leg two right here. "
"5452060","5454420"," This is leg one up here."
"5457200","5457420"," Right."
"5457460","5460500"," So the first leg down, this is the second leg down. "
"5460500","5463820"," And you have to trade each one independent of each other."
"5464220","5467220"," You've got two different, two different trades here."
"5468880","5469820"," Well, you see it. "
"5469940","5470780"," I'm right about to get rid of this."
"5471960","5475800"," All right, we can leave the line there, but there's two legs here."
"5478090","5478250"," Right. "
"5478450","5480170"," You've got this leg down right here."
"5481230","5484090"," I'm just gonna make this on a larger time frame here."
"5488190","5491330"," This will make you, this will give you some idea. "
"5491630","5492810"," This is not really chart right here, right?"
"5494570","5496390"," So here's your first leg down right here."
"5497190","5497930"," Mission complete."
"5498950","5501990"," So if you're a bear and you're like, yeah, I want to get this down here. "
"5503630","5506870"," You know, this was the move right here, right?"
"5507330","5510760"," This was the move, right?"
"5511300","5513700"," And there's probably still some more juice down here."
"5514760","5515680"," Into the minutes."
"5517320","5519060"," But I wouldn't be caught dead down here, right?"
"5519420","5521100"," You'd want to take your money and run. "
"5521660","5522140"," Right."
"5522280","5523280"," See, blast down here."
"5523360","5523940"," Take your money and run. "
"5524920","5529260"," If we break down below here, it should be with some velocity."
"5529840","5532440"," I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have, I'm meant to make a post about this."
"5532560","5534500"," This morning, I was fucking sleeping. "
"5535560","5542620"," But if we break below, and this support at 396, usually one of two things happen."
"5543820","5547600"," We either get a loss of velocity when we go back up."
"5548420","5551000"," If we can't make a new high, we'll then blast down below. "
"5552200","5554400"," This is a great trade for bears right here."
"5554840","5555520"," Take ass trade."
"5556640","5563120"," If we blast through with velocity at any point, let's say blast through with violence. "
"5563880","5567640"," We almost always come back and retest and then make the real move down."
"5568440","5573620"," So if you miss this part of the trade, if this is what happens, you just be waiting up here"
"5573620","5574600"," for this to happen again."
"5575540","5577000"," You get a massive rejection. "
"5577940","5580000"," So I'll show you three trades, okay?"
"5580780","5585500"," As we get done with this trade here, as this trade ends itself, there's three trades."
"5590390","5592990"," There's where we don't have velocity in the downward move."
"5593570","5597030"," If we come back up, find real rejection at like 404. "
"5598350","5602670"," If we can't get a new high and close all these gaps above, we'll blast back through down here."
"5603310","5605270"," This is the next, one of the next bear trades."
"5606930","5609710"," Another bear trade that would be coming up would be. "
"5611090","5613590"," We blast through with velocity way down here, right?"
"5613750","5615010"," You're like, shit, I missed the cap."
"5615730","5619770"," You just wait because it's going to come back up like this and then blast back down."
"5619910","5620970"," This is the real money here. "
"5621730","5623010"," This is the danger one."
"5623110","5624590"," This is where it may or may not work."
"5625870","5630370"," Three out of ten times it might work, but you're just guessing down here. "
"5633070","5636970"," How you would know if the downward trade was over, this is trade number three."
"5637670","5644210"," This is where we blast down here briefly and we actually make some kind of a new high from"
"5644210","5648430"," previously right here and hold it and we would continue higher."
"5648810","5650210"," This is what, this is like the Tesla trade. "
"5650410","5651430"," Hey, I'll take it at 220 and higher."
"5652270","5654990"," This is where you get long again as a Tesla bull right over here."
"5655970","5662170"," This is how you know you could put a short on right here and a stop just above. "
"5663450","5665570"," And you'd be like, fuck, I got stopped out."
"5665690","5666850"," The bulls have the ball again."
"5667130","5667590"," Does that make sense?"
"5667870","5668690"," That's where the bulls get the ball. "
"5669410","5677830"," But otherwise, we're coming into today and tomorrow, the first leg being completed down on the spy"
"5677830","5678270"," here."
"5681790","5683650"," And you never want to be a part of that group, right?"
"5683770","5693050"," You never want to be a part of, you never want to be a part of sellers or buyers, like"
"5693050","5695390"," top buyers, top sellers, any of that kind of thing."
"5695950","5704970"," You always want to be, you always want to be like starting the trade days before and wrapping up"
"5704970","5706090"," the trade somewhere down in here. "
"5707450","5713450"," And then you wrap the trade somewhere down in here and then somewhere around 396, 395ish."
"5714610","5719770"," And then you, what you do is you end up waiting for the break below that 396 for the next"
"5719770","5720310"," leg of the trade."
"5727740","5728800"," Hey, Rod, how are you, man?"
"5732710","5734010"," Sorry, I'm able to give you a call, Rod. "
"5734850","5736710"," I haven't called anybody over the weekend."
"5737190","5746310"," I've been stuck in, not computer, some computer development or some software development, some code"
"5746310","5750050"," development, but all kinds of developments underneath the surface."
"5754800","5755780"," No, no, I'm still long. "
"5757000","5757820"," I'm long here."
"5759060","5760000"," I'll be long here."
"5760000","5761640"," I'll take long here. "
"5762060","5763980"," I'll even add to a position down here."
"5766450","5767850"," I'm long for a squeeze here."
"5775400","5776960"," I'm long as fuck here. "
"5778680","5780280"," I'm long, all day long here."
"5783620","5784700"," I'll give you a shot, Rod."
"5786160","5788020"," I just haven't had the time. "
"5788700","5797590"," I did spend, I did spend, I went to, I felt like somehow, I think it was Friday."
"5797590","5802070"," I found myself at this like hipster bowling alley."
"5802850","5804930"," Dude, what is up with that plant with those places?"
"5805970","5807370"," I went to a hipster bowling alley. "
"5809420","5810460"," It was great."
"5811920","5814960"," But dude, it was like 400 bucks when I was done."
"5815760","5816460"," It wasn't cheap. "
"5818060","5819140"," It was super expensive."
"5819600","5820240"," The food was great."
"5822160","5823000"," The booze was great. "
"5823180","5825620"," They don't drink hard liquor anymore."
"5825620","5827740"," I had some bourbon."
"5828400","5830540"," It was really good. "
"5831620","5833520"," The bowling was ridiculously expensive."
"5834580","5839520"," They kind of run the time and money scam, not a money scam."
"5839820","5842540"," They run the bowling scam on you. "
"5843140","5846080"," You like ordering food, then you're bowling."
"5847120","5848980"," Every hour of bowling is like $70."
"5850340","5853300"," Then your food gets like two hours to get your food. "
"5854140","5855720"," Then you're like, well, I don't want to rush eating."
"5857960","5859100"," So they get you."
"5860240","5861580"," It's not like old school bowling. "
"5862020","5868200"," Go to the shitty bowling alley and you pay like 10 bucks an hour per person or something like that."
"5873700","5875960"," So yeah, so I don't know."
"5877260","5878160"," Bowling was wild. "
"5878540","5882980"," We met, so there was a really cool guy next to us, our group of people, and they were real"
"5882980","5883520"," bowlers."
"5884860","5890000"," They have all the technique down."
"5890300","5891520"," How do you hold the ball with the fingers?"
"5894840","5896200"," They take it seriously. "
"5897780","5899080"," We all suck at bowling."
"5899320","5900000"," I suck at bowling."
"5900860","5902720"," My youngest daughter is very athletic. "
"5903980","5904700"," She had no problems."
"5905000","5906020"," She walked up to this guy."
"5906320","5908160"," This guy had a demon slayer shirt on. "
"5908160","5914280"," My daughter loves anime, manga, whatever."
"5914560","5916740"," I don't know how to pronounce it, but that's the stuff she likes."
"5920840","5924740"," She's like, oh, she's introduced to herself. "
"5925220","5926560"," My daughter just turned 10."
"5927300","5928420"," She's still very young."
"5928640","5929360"," She's still nine. "
"5931260","5932840"," She's like, I really like your t-shirt."
"5934040","5935080"," He just gushed."
"5935560","5936320"," It was like a grown man. "
"5936320","5939340"," And she's like, and you're a really good bowler."
"5939720","5941080"," Could you ever give me a few pointers?"
"5942000","5944480"," And so this guy showed her like four or five pointers."
"5944800","5947700"," Like, to me, I was like, I couldn't do any of that shit. "
"5948700","5953300"," And dude, she was like, put kicking out, holding the ball correctly."
"5955720","5959740"," The ball's spinning all the way down the lanes and then makes a strike."
"5961220","5964200"," I'm like, you got to be kidding me. "
"5965780","5968960"," And so she was like a professional, like, five minutes."
"5970280","5974560"," And so the guy kept me afterwards was like, dude, his daughter's got natural talent, man."
"5975320","5977720"," And I'm like, dude, I gotta maybe start taking her bowler. "
"5978780","5979940"," She was really good at it."
"5980200","5981960"," So I don't have to say, it was awesome."
"5983720","5986260"," And then we did, we did some hiking with the dogs. "
"5986780","5991500"," Went on a nice long afternoon hike one day this weekend, which is really nice."
"5991760","5992920"," And then we went to dinner a few times."
"5993800","5995820"," We had beef short ribs, which was delicious. "
"5995980","5998640"," We had a small pasta company."
"5999360","6000140"," Makes all their pasta."
"6000580","6001160"," They had a tortilla. "
"6001800","6003100"," And I had some buccotini."
"6004040","6006340"," I didn't have it with a, with a kachui puppy."
"6006660","6011180"," I had the, had some veal meatballs and a pomodoro sauce with it. "
"6011260","6015380"," And it was like a summer jarred."
"6015380","6017960"," Like bell jar tomatoes and stuff."
"6017980","6018480"," It was wild. "
"6019980","6025600"," Like if you make a good spaghetti sauce, like from like your garden vegetables or whatever, I don't"
"6025600","6027940"," know where they got them, but it was banging."
"6028880","6029860"," It wasn't cheap."
"6030080","6031340"," It wasn't cheap pasta. "
"6032600","6037680"," You know if you get spaghetti and meatballs and it's like 35 bucks, it better be good."
"6048520","6050620"," Oh, dude, I got something for stanks too."
"6051520","6054000"," Oh, dude. "
"6055620","6056060"," Yes."
"6056800","6058880"," Winky kept the stanks thing that I wrote."
"6060440","6061540"," You're awesome, Winky. "
"6063880","6066980"," They were like, you can name points, whatever you want."
"6067180","6068240"," And I was like, we're not doing points."
"6068540","6070720"," We're doing stanks, like stonks. "
"6076060","6077500"," You're earning stanks now."
"6078100","6083740"," Well, it says like you can do points where you can do like, I was like, gosh, I do stonks."
"6084120","6085680"," I'm like, fuck that will do stanks. "
"6092150","6093330"," Dude, you're awesome, Winky."
"6098640","6099800"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"6101620","6103140"," I love Suvi, man. "
"6103820","6105380"," I fucking love Suvi."
"6106300","6107640"," I used to have a circulator."
"6108680","6110100"," I had a circulator that burned in a house fire. "
"6110100","6111120"," I had a beautiful circulator."
"6112700","6113960"," I love circulators."
"6114940","6115160"," Love them. "
"6117220","6118100"," Primo, what up, brother?"
"6121050","6122030"," A stanky leg."
"6124650","6125430"," Yeah, I love them."
"6126490","6128490"," I think we're going to get a capitulation move here. "
"6129190","6130710"," I'm hoping that we either get a bottom."
"6131330","6132710"," We're going to start bottoming out here."
"6133010","6135630"," Or we get a quick move down in a blast fire. "
"6136950","6137690"," One or the other."
"6146550","6148210"," Yeah, I want to see this tag above here."
"6158920","6164060"," What do you guys think of the scrolling, you guys like that?"
"6164060","6172480"," Or would you prefer what I'll do is I didn't get a chance to see the best"
"6172480","6175600"," RSS feeds. "
"6175760","6177660"," I'll try to get some ticker feeds."
"6178720","6179900"," I need to check out."
"6180100","6188980"," I need to check out RSS feeds that show ticker data. "
"6191600","6195580"," It might take me a week or so to find the right RSS feeds."
"6207760","6208480"," Nice, dude."
"6209300","6210600"," Yeah, you guys will earn points. "
"6211620","6213000"," Just so you guys know, you guys will."
"6213340","6216340"," I think we have some gambling games, too, that don't cause this."
"6216540","6217580"," None of this is money-based. "
"6217820","6220880"," I want you guys to understand that there's no money-based in this."
"6221520","6223240"," We just give you fake money."
"6224020","6225580"," You guys can bet against each other. "
"6226440","6229100"," You guys can do some really cool shit."
"6229720","6230720"," You can do cool shit."
"6231920","6233240"," It's like right where you are right now. "
"6233360","6238340"," You can actually bet each other for points and be like, yeah, we're going up or we're going down."
"6240420","6242860"," And you can wager the number of points."
"6244720","6248620"," And then there's like a slot machine, gambling, that kind of stuff. "
"6249180","6253700"," And what I'll do is I'll make a prize once a week or once a month or whatever."
"6254680","6259740"," And whoever has the most points after a month or whatever, I'll send something to."
"6260120","6263480"," I'll send you guys like a mug or a hat or something like that. "
"6264200","6265800"," I'll see you guys get a prize."
"6268020","6268500"," Something."
"6270020","6271320"," I'll figure something out to send you guys. "
"6276340","6277480"," Yeah, minutes are tomorrow."
"6279040","6280220"," Yeah, minutes are tomorrow."
"6280620","6281680"," We should sell into the minutes, right?"
"6282000","6282800"," Normally we sell the minutes. "
"6283820","6285980"," You'll hear all the garbage out there and all the."
"6287120","6290940"," You next by the meeting, sell the minutes almost almost like clockwork."
"6291340","6294220"," 70% of the time you sell the minutes, you buy the meeting. "
"6300880","6302060"," Chief master steak."
"6307890","6309270"," Well, that was my take on it."
"6309330","6314410"," I was like, so he is saying someone is going to earn a ton of points, then lose the prize"
"6314410","6315210"," to a gambler. "
"6315430","6316750"," And that's what I was thinking about."
"6316870","6317950"," I was like, I bet you."
"6318930","6322490"," The way this sub is the way that this YouTube channel is. "
"6322790","6327350"," One of you guys will be like, I'm kicking them out and I'm going to let it all ride on"
"6327350","6327630"," betting."
"6328270","6332730"," I don't know betting me that I'm going to fade the cap one day and I'm gone."
"6332930","6333390"," You're at zero. "
"6335630","6337270"," Some of you might never win."
"6339350","6341110"," A bunch of dirty gamblers."
"6346730","6347170"," Nice. "
"6348370","6350130"," Oh, it's a betting has opened."
"6356540","6358420"," Each day in shorts knows how to do this."
"6360160","6362580"," Each day in shorts like betting the whole bank on it. "
"6366190","6367610"," Ooh, seven days to Vegas."
"6368290","6368590"," All right."
"6372770","6375170"," Yeah, I should keep you entertained when it's slow and stuff like that. "
"6380360","6386510"," Now trading four hundred and ten four hundred point twenty three."
"6387290","6389050"," So we can tag that four thousand."
"6390980","6392500"," Yeah, we can work out in the background. "
"6393800","6394980"," It doesn't work today."
"6395120","6395720"," We'll figure it out."
"6398290","6399390"," We're going to buy more points. "
"6399990","6403370"," What we'll do is I think at some point we can give you."
"6404330","6405930"," At some point we can give you."
"6407910","6412630"," So there's a bunch of stuff like we'll give points to depending upon how long you've been here. "
"6412630","6416190"," You'll get like twenty thousand points or something or ten thousand or five thousand whatever."
"6416410","6416770"," Fuck it is."
"6417630","6420930"," If you're like a new subscriber, you'll get like five hundred points. "
"6421470","6424590"," If you're if you like the channel, you'll get so many points."
"6425310","6427650"," If you do a super chat, you'll get so many points."
"6427650","6429310"," If you donate, you'll get so many points. "
"6430370","6433130"," I think like a donation, you get like twenty thousand points or something."
"6434350","6436350"," I think we have to work on all that shit in the background."
"6438090","6440470"," So there's like a bunch of work down here to do. "
"6444670","6445030"," Yeah."
"6446890","6448930"," Yeah, newbies will get some newbies will get some love."
"6449490","6450870"," If you're a new subscriber, you'll get some love. "
"6451330","6452130"," It's really a long time."
"6452390","6453150"," I feel like a long time."
"6453990","6455930"," And then what's cool is there's commands. "
"6456890","6460070"," So if somebody comments, you can check how long they've been a subscriber."
"6460890","6463070"," Like if they've been a subscriber for a year, two years."
"6464270","6465350"," They've been a subscriber for a day. "
"6465910","6468570"," You can actually see how long someone's been a subscriber."
"6468870","6472270"," You can see you can track like by day, by month."
"6473290","6475190"," How long, how often someone comments. "
"6476090","6478110"," Do they take part in the chat or not?"
"6479110","6480090"," That kind of stuff."
"6480850","6481350"," It's kind of cool."
"6492600","6493520"," You stinks. "
"6496140","6496480"," Yeah."
"6496780","6501180"," If you guys want to know how to do commands, I'll get you a maybe winky at night."
"6501380","6505280"," At some point can put out a document that you guys can write. "
"6505280","6509660"," You know what I'll do is you know where the see the chat rules down here."
"6510540","6511380"," I'll make a."
"6512680","6514680"," I'll make a like a box."
"6515920","6520680"," That gives some of the command prompts so you guys can see them and I'll roll. "
"6520840","6523440"," I'll roll them in and out so you guys get familiar with command."
"6523820","6531620"," So you guys understand what you can do like some of the shit that you can do."
"6537320","6541160"," For each one, you'll get points for each one for Twitch, YouTube. "
"6544670","6545590"," I trade with these things."
"6549250","6551950"," Yeah, this is all included with Twitch and YouTube."
"6554130","6555070"," It's all included. "
"6557370","6558810"," It's just a matter of designing it."
"6565390","6566510"," He's stinky shorts."
"6575220","6576000"," Too funny. "
"6583030","6583990"," That's just wild."
"6590540","6591520"," Yeah, I'm holding calls."
"6592460","6593940"," I'm going to add down here too if I can. "
"6593940","6597800"," In a matter of fact, I'll add 10 right now."
"6602330","6604690"," Now I'm 20, 20 contracts long."
"6614750","6616210"," 20 contracts long now. "
"6619600","6621420"," There'll be some changes coming too."
"6621740","6624700"," So I was talking with Hey Chaz."
"6626320","6630240"," And he was saying that I should take breaks first so I can take a leak. "
"6631600","6633840"," But it gives people a chance to catch up."
"6634720","6638960"," He was saying that sometimes people will leave the stream or drop in the stream."
"6640340","6642720"," So if I take a quick break, like 15 minutes. "
"6644840","6648140"," Throughout the day, it gives people a chance to speed up the playback."
"6648840","6650240"," Find out where we are in the market."
"6651400","6657500"," And then so they feel like they're in the feel or think that they're have caught up to where we"
"6657500","6658080"," are in the broadcast. "
"6658520","6660360"," So some people can't join us all day long."
"6660360","6662520"," So let's say it's like you're not here at 9 30."
"6662640","6663480"," I'm not here at 9 30. "
"6663720","6664960"," It's like 12 o'clock or something."
"6665800","6667900"," Then it's like one o'clock or three o'clock."
"6668080","6671100"," It just gives people a chance to see where we are. "
"6677780","6680020"," Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff coming you guys' way."
"6681140","6686100"," You guys should be seeing changes and improvements."
"6687600","6689680"," The developers are working in the background hard. "
"6689980","6694880"," We have a developer that is trying to develop a bunch of tools for you guys."
"6696100","6696760"," Gangster tools."
"6697080","6698960"," I've never seen tools like this anywhere on the internet. "
"6699500","6699900"," Anywhere."
"6700040","6701380"," I've never seen any of these tools anywhere."
"6702480","6705400"," You guys are going to your minds are going to be blown by these tools. "
"6721880","6723200"," The betting has been closed."
"6729200","6733340"," And you'll get discord invites will be automatic in the chat at some point."
"6733540","6736000"," They'll come out every hour or three hours or something. "
"6736200","6737800"," They'll be an auto post in the mod."
"6746160","6747500"," There's a bunch of cool stuff."
"6748000","6750460"," You guys will see the you guys will see the command prompts. "
"6750460","6753560"," We'll write something up and we'll rotate them in and out so you guys can see."
"6754700","6755980"," You'll have discord invites."
"6756080","6757740"," It'll have all kinds of cool stuff. "
"6764660","6766580"," Yeah, there'll be tools in discord."
"6769180","6770560"," There'll be bots in discord."
"6771420","6776760"," But generally speaking, most of these tools you probably want to use on the website. "
"6777120","6778160"," Hopefully it's a companion piece."
"6779360","6781540"," We're going to be paying for real-time data."
"6782380","6785640"," So you should be able to go to the website, leave it open on a screener. "
"6786640","6789980"," And we got some really cool stuff alerts and stuff like that."
"6792420","6797400"," So you can see where bottoms are, where clusters are, all that kind of stuff."
"6804290","6805610"," I will have referral. "
"6806710","6807990"," How about this legend?"
"6808410","6810930"," Just give it one day and I'll get you a referral link, bro."
"6812570","6814750"," So the other things they worked on in the background."
"6816690","6818370"," I'm trying to self-fund. "
"6819510","6820930"," Trying to self-fund."
"6822610","6824910"," The launch of this stuff, it's very expensive."
"6825490","6827110"," Like the data cost 15k a month. "
"6827330","6827770"," It's like not cheap."
"6828650","6829290"," It's very expensive."
"6829850","6837110"," So I'm trying to make this seamless where you, where if you don't want to pay for subscription, you"
"6837110","6838210"," don't have to get by. "
"6839190","6842170"," So the weekend I worked on an Amazon thing."
"6842490","6847310"," So I'm going to review some books, this shit that I actually read or believe in."
"6847770","6849150"," And then I have some meetings. "
"6850830","6853330"," With book map and tasty."
"6854970","6858010"," So I'll put some links if you guys ever sign up for stuff."
"6858470","6860490"," It doesn't cost you anything more than normal. "
"6861050","6865990"," I'm going to put up some Amazon links so you guys, if you can support me."
"6866730","6869670"," You just click on it, even if you're not going to buy the book that I'm talking about."
"6870870","6876630"," And then if you make normal purchases, they give like an affiliate marketing thing. "
"6877190","6878070"," I don't know much about it."
"6879150","6880330"," My wife was helping me with it."
"6880410","6882390"," So we can have no fucking clue what that stuff is. "
"6882910","6885230"," Especially if you don't tip, you're like, fuck that."
"6885270","6885690"," I don't like tipping."
"6886550","6888570"," If you hate advertising, that kind of shit. "
"6890470","6892590"," The just clicking through an Amazon link helps."
"6893510","6894750"," It helps me a ton."
"6895030","6897870"," So it helps to get the tools out to you guys too. "
"6899390","6901790"," And dude, you know, there's another part of this, right?"
"6902030","6906170"," There's like there's somewhere around like 10 people working in the background."
"6906690","6911410"," And at some point, I have to give them an honorarium at some point."
"6911750","6914210"," You want to keep them interested for all the hard work they do. "
"6920680","6923420"," Hey, Diamond, when did you not get the confirmation email?"
"6923580","6924600"," When did you sign up on the website?"
"6925460","6926520"," Was that like this week?"
"6927760","6929140"," So you didn't get a confirmation email?"
"6929320","6930420"," You know, I told me that was Chaz."
"6931260","6933360"," Chaz told me there was no confirmation email."
"6935560","6937080"," He told me that too this week. "
"6937220","6940040"," I got to tell me that there wasn't, which kicks out the bots."
"6941720","6943320"," So I'll look back in on that again, man."
"6946200","6947140"," Thanks for saying something. "
"6950640","6952160"," I thought we addressed this last week."
"6952260","6953060"," So I'll look at it again."
"6954280","6955440"," Thanks for saying something, man. "
"6962230","6963810"," You've been in marketing for 20 years."
"6964890","6965130"," Yeah."
"6965310","6965550"," All right. "
"6966150","6967710"," Hendrix, I got, I was going to contact you."
"6967750","6968730"," I just haven't had the time, man."
"6969570","6977300"," I've been trying to find five minutes to, I've been trying to get in touch with you, but I just"
"6977300","6978040"," haven't a chance. "
"6982120","6982460"," What are promotions?"
"6982760","6984100"," I don't know what promotions tabs are."
"6990220","6992240"," They're actually on saying check promotion tabs."
"6992240","6993340"," I don't even know what those are. "
"7004070","7006010"," I don't know what female promotions are either."
"7006210","7007310"," I don't know what any of that stuff is."
"7009210","7019170"," If, uh, oh, yeah, I see that the email went"
"7019170","7022470"," to promotions tab or even, even to. "
"7022750","7024650"," So what's weird was it's hard."
"7024870","7029750"," So we just had to scale up to a new email service so that we don't get stuck in spam"
"7029750","7030310"," folders."
"7030910","7032370"," It gets very expensive. "
"7043760","7044480"," Yeah, you can see."
"7044700","7045520"," Do you guys want to see?"
"7045660","7046620"," So just a couple of things."
"7048380","7056060"," Um, do you see, do you see how the velocity of the move is starting to curve is slowly, do"
"7056060","7056600"," you guys see this?"
"7056820","7057860"," You don't even need to see the velocity. "
"7058660","7061180"," So do you see how the curve is slowing here?"
"7062260","7063640"," The curve is slowing."
"7065080","7067740"," It's a little bit, let's see how the curve is starting to flatten here."
"7068640","7071740"," Uh, now you can still see a quick little blast down here, right?"
"7071860","7074700"," The capitulation move, um, for the leg higher. "
"7076380","7076800"," Something like that."
"7077760","7081900"," Uh, but you can all, you can already see that you can already see that this is rotational."
"7082900","7084720"," Um, from, from my perspective, it is. "
"7085220","7087260"," I'll look at the velocity for you in the background now."
"7089570","7095830"," Uh, velocity is turning up on the five minute."
"7097090","7097710"," Right here. "
"7100600","7103180"," Uh, we're bottoming on the hourly velocity right now."
"7103360","7105720"," We're at the very low end on the, on the hourly velocity."
"7106620","7109560"," Uh, five minutes cranking right now, starting to turn up. "
"7109580","7111320"," We're going to get, we're going to get a squeeze higher at some point."
"7112160","7113140"," It's a matter of time."
"7115640","7116980"," I'm waiting on the early bar. "
"7117740","7120180"," That's how 12.25 bears got five minutes here to."
"7120720","7124560"," There's pretty much have five minutes here to squeeze this one last blood bath down."
"7126390","7128110"," They got five more minutes, man. "
"7146710","7149510"," Five more minutes bears got five minutes."
"7151270","7153050"," Come on bears, you can do it."
"7153430","7154650"," You got five minutes, bro. "
"7154810","7155830"," You got to get underneath that 400."
"7156630","7158010"," You ain't got no more time."
"7160120","7162760"," It's 12.26. You got four more minutes. "
"7165400","7167540"," Our early velocity is turning up to the upside."
"7183360","7185280"," Let me read off some news headlines to you."
"7185520","7187520"," I'm probably going to take a potty break here in just a minute. "
"7189520","7196560"," 12.27. We've got nice, uh, news coming out all morning."
"7197000","7197740"," Uh, that's being used."
"7199380","7199660"," Hold on. "
"7199760","7200180"," Let me take a look."
"7201280","7204960"," You have all kinds of good, foreign relations kind of dumping all morning."
"7214060","7216360"," There's no real negative news out there, right?"
"7216720","7218400"," So you're going to have to make shit up. "
"7219900","7227980"," Uh, when you don't have bad news, bad economic news, you roll out, uh, the, the foreign news,"
"7228040","7228280"," right?"
"7228620","7230880"," Or foreign diplomacy news, right?"
"7231060","7231440"," Stuff like that."
"7232440","7239480"," Uh, all morning long, like, uh, VP Harris talking about, uh, inflation reduction acts with Francis,"
"7239980","7240640"," President Macron."
"7243210","7244990"," I'm looking through some of this stuff. "
"7244990","7248770"," I'm like, I don't even, the news is so slow, it's kind of disgusting here."
"7250050","7252170"," Uh, February 21st."
"7252330","7262330"," We've got effective funds rate 4.58% February 17 versus, uh, 4.58% to February 16th. "
"7264080","7269360"," We've got a US January national median home price for existing homes."
"7271080","7274900"," $395,000 up 1.3% from January 2022."
"7276220","7280680"," On that note, on that topic too, uh, it was kind of funny. "
"7280820","7286980"," I was reading, uh, or I was reading a CNBC C story about the housing crash that's happening right"
"7286980","7287300"," now."
"7288340","7292280"," And when can people expect the housing market to turn around?"
"7292940","7296140"," And I was like, man, this impacts like, I'm like, this impacts like."
"7297300","7299020"," 1% of homeowners. "
"7300580","7305160"," I mean, if you look, if you're a home buyer, I don't know who this, if you're a home buyer"
"7305160","7307620"," out there, but I'm going to tell exactly what happened here."
"7310270","7312790"," Home prices have been going up."
"7313690","7316890"," For a decade like this, right?"
"7319730","7320530"," And then COVID came. "
"7321890","7323150"," And they went like this."
"7326610","7333100"," So literally, if you bought a house, if you bought a house like a decade ago."
"7333580","7335720"," And the housing markets come down to like here. "
"7340050","7345330"," So like anyone that Bob back here is like, what do they, why do they keep telling me that there's"
"7345330","7346050"," a housing crash."
"7348970","7351370"," You could literally come all the way to fuck back down here."
"7352510","7354410"," And most people are fine. "
"7355030","7357490"," Like most like most people."
"7357730","7361110"," If you bought before COVID, you're like, you're like up here."
"7361490","7362350"," You're like somewhere in here. "
"7363030","7364470"," So like none of these people care."
"7365410","7366530"," They just don't care."
"7366750","7367010"," They're up. "
"7368470","7369590"," In a huge way."
"7371690","7373870"," I always like when they're like, there's a housing crash."
"7374150","7380230"," I'm like, dude, I was buying houses that are, I have some houses that I own that are up thousands"
"7380230","7381190"," of percent. "
"7381690","7384050"," I have some that are only up a few hundred, but."
"7385710","7386410"," I don't know."
"7386850","7388130"," I always like it. "
"7388450","7390610"," I was reading CNBC and I'm like, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"7391330","7395730"," I'm like, you're talking about like $600,000 houses that are now worth a million fucking dollars."
"7396510","7398990"," $500,000 houses are like million bucks right now. "
"7400090","7403970"," Like you couldn't expect that to go up to 800,000 after a decade."
"7404050","7406250"," I'm like, you're like, it's doom and gloom."
"7406470","7407590"," I'm like, I don't think so. "
"7407850","7411190"," I don't think most homeowners, not all, but most."
"7413820","7416260"," I don't think everybody bought after rates went up."
"7416400","7418680"," I think most people bought way before rates went up. "
"7419180","7420620"," That's why there's a shortage, right?"
"7423000","7424420"," Before before COVID."
"7431440","7434620"," Like anyone that held anyone that owned a house during COVID."
"7436300","7442560"," Like into COVID and then couldn't afford the prices after COVID, there's still stupid up on their"
"7442560","7442920"," homes. "
"7443840","7444400"," Stupid."
"7446080","7449760"," Like there was a, there was a, there was like gangbusters pre COVID."
"7450780","7454740"," So I don't know, I don't understand the whole housing crash thing. "
"7456740","7457920"," It's just stupid."
"7459660","7463680"," Like, like what you need to see for people to be truly upset."
"7463680","7466940"," I mean, they do take double and triple and quadruple mortgages. "
"7468240","7470280"," Against their properties, but most people."
"7472600","7477040"," When you, when you look at how long, if they've owned like a decade, if they've owned five plus"
"7477040","7477400"," years."
"7478720","7479520"," They don't care. "
"7480400","7481380"," They could care less."
"7494960","7497060"," Yeah, I don't think it, I agree with you, Winky."
"7497060","7502800"," Like I think that, well, my brother-in-law just bought a, he sold a house. "
"7502800","7504600"," He was in and bought a house with high rates."
"7506600","7509860"," I want to say three months ago or six months ago somewhere in there."
"7510440","7511080"," He didn't care. "
"7512160","7515600"," He had, he had bought his last house."
"7517020","7518600"," I think 10 or 15 years ago."
"7519360","7524340"," And he was like, dude, he's like, I'm so, he's like, he's like, I'm like, my house is gonna have"
"7524340","7525900"," like 10 times in value at this point. "
"7527420","7531860"," He bought his house from not 10 times, but he bought his house for like a hundred thousand, maybe a"
"7531860","7532760"," hundred thirty thousand."
"7533100","7538160"," And when he sold it, he's, I think he sold it for six hundred thousand dollars or something."
"7540880","7541920"," You know, like. "
"7543680","7546080"," He was like, what do you think about me paying the rates?"
"7546300","7549100"," I'm like, like, what do you care?"
"7550820","7556200"," Like, you just made like four or five hundred percent on your, on your original buy, like."
"7557060","7558100"," You can't go wrong."
"7559740","7561100"," We're, we're, we're gonna do to you. "
"7568120","7572760"," How do we, what's the bad dream scenario for bulls?"
"7573520","7575020"," Who wrote that chase?"
"7576460","7579600"," Hey, chase, who wrote the bad dream scenario for bulls?"
"7581000","7582140"," Where did that come from?"
"7588510","7590150"," Who wrote the bad dream for bulls?"
"7592500","7593100"," Who wrote that?"
"7602030","7605280"," The bad dream scenario?"
"7605500","7606480"," That is the fucking dream."
"7609080","7612060"," The fucking good dream as we trade the three ninety six."
"7613880","7615000"," That's the good dream. "
"7616380","7618240"," How is that bad dream scenario?"
"7620180","7621660"," Is it really Spock, Emma?"
"7622400","7623100"," What are they fucking crazy?"
"7623560","7625360"," Do they go in more bananas over there than usual?"
"7630720","7632640"," They got to be going bananas over there."
"7633520","7635020"," That's like the best dream ever."
"7646880","7654320"," The bad dream scenario?"
"7659390","7661850"," Oh, sweet summer child. "
"7666970","7667850"," Oh, boy."
"7677230","7687120"," So we have the, so we have the because we start breaking four hundred four thousand say"
"7687120","7688860"," it's tomorrow than crash or big dump scenario."
"7689320","7690880"," Alright, let's talk about the last two weeks. "
"7692520","7694780"," Let's take a look at the last two weeks real quick."
"7696020","7698220"," Something been talked about for the last two weeks."
"7701080","7702440"," Alright, last two weeks. "
"7702740","7702940"," Okay."
"7704640","7706260"," So let's look at the last month."
"7711720","7714300"," Ah, what's this over here February ninth?"
"7714940","7718400"," I think this February ninth, right?"
"7719200","7721100"," Second, third, fourth, fifth. "
"7721480","7722400"," This is the ninth, right?"
"7726570","7727410"," So we've got that."
"7727550","7732010"," We've got prices not seen since February ninth two weeks ago."
"7732990","7736430"," This is the part where if you're short, you got completely fucking ran over. "
"7737350","7740530"," This is the other part where you got completely ran over again."
"7741310","7743070"," This is the part where you were wrong again."
"7744210","7746270"," Then we, then we came down here. "
"7748630","7750150"," So what did they call it on there?"
"7751130","7752150"," Bull's worst nightmare?"
"7754350","7756810"," Let's go back and look at the bull's worst nightmare."
"7759430","7761110"," Yeah, I don't see any worst nightmare."
"7761370","7765490"," I just see like, I see we went to 420. "
"7766090","7767230"," Alright, let's take our money and runner."
"7767470","7767790"," Let's hedge."
"7768330","7768930"," That's all I see. "
"7769650","7773670"," And then I see hell yeah, bring it down second by a dip down here."
"7775030","7778790"," Hit me at that 396 second blast off again up here."
"7780590","7782470"," So I guess that best case. "
"7784190","7787650"," If you're not best case, but what you really want is you want to buy 396."
"7789210","7790830"," With some stops down below."
"7792450","7795370"," And I don't know you lose a dollar, did you?"
"7795890","7797350"," You made all this money here. "
"7797510","7798490"," You made all this money here."
"7798550","7800170"," You put some more risk on the market here."
"7800530","7806790"," If it starts to sell down below here and we want to hit this 380 or something like that. "
"7807830","7808230"," Sweet."
"7808790","7809630"," I'll put a short on."
"7810570","7811230"," I don't know. "
"7811430","7813650"," I don't know how that works out."
"7814350","7816050"," I don't think this is the bull's worst case."
"7816250","7818530"," I think that this is the bull's best case. "
"7818530","7822470"," I think that you buy that dip down there."
"7823190","7825350"," Even if we sell it down later on."
"7826770","7828090"," If this rolls over here. "
"7829410","7829850"," Yeah."
"7830330","7832970"," This would be the failure for bulls up here, 405, 406."
"7834250","7835790"," Both bulls regain this up here. "
"7836830","7838070"," I don't know what you'd say to that."
"7839050","7839890"," If you trade 430."
"7841250","7842330"," You can measure that. "
"7843270","7843810"," I don't know what."
"7844050","7846330"," I think bull's best case is to buy this down here."
"7847170","7847950"," Not worst case. "
"7849830","7850690"," That's how I see."
"7851230","7852310"," That's how I see things."
"7853010","7854650"," Bull's best case is down here. "
"7855970","7857070"," I could be wrong on that."
"7859990","7861710"," If we sell here."
"7863430","7865210"," It's just the same as usual, right?"
"7865390","7867750"," You want to buy a 360 down below and send a March. "
"7869570","7871290"," And then dog cost average, even below it."
"7871370","7872370"," 3,200 if you have to."
"7873650","7874570"," This isn't a bear. "
"7875170","7876730"," To me, I don't see this as bearish."
"7877630","7879750"," I see this as where do I buy a dip?"
"7880690","7882370"," I haven't seen that since when."
"7883630","7884950"," Oh, yeah, let's look at it. "
"7886290","7887210"," That over there."
"7887370","7888070"," That's like June."
"7888330","7888730"," That's June. "
"7891010","7891710"," That's October."
"7893130","7893930"," That's December."
"7894890","7896430"," Now we're just sitting right over here. "
"7897490","7897810"," I don't know."
"7897870","7898170"," I don't know."
"7898570","7900250"," Let's say bull's best case. "
"7901370","7902630"," As they buy here."
"7903690","7905810"," Or no, the best case might be 3,200."
"7906830","7909990"," It's probably bull's worst case in a dip to buy, maybe. "
"7910350","7913800"," I don't know."
"7914900","7917260"," Bull's best case is probably 3,200."
"7918820","7921180"," Their next best case is 3,600. "
"7923400","7925720"," Or they could just run this up to 430 up here."
"7927380","7928700"," Just blast this up higher."
"7930400","7930900"," Roll this over. "
"7932960","7934080"," Blast that up higher."
"7935380","7935980"," Roll this one over."
"7936940","7937620"," Something like that. "
"7939480","7940640"," Maybe we're wrong."
"7945420","7946220"," Something like that."
"7953860","7956280"," Yeah, baby, sellers want to stay underneath this. "
"7960300","7961780"," We're not even talking about the timing."
"7964380","7964900"," Are we?"
"7965660","7966880"," I couldn't imagine."
"7969000","7972600"," I couldn't imagine like. "
"7974120","7976560"," What are there?"
"7977860","7979480"," Where's the book map shit?"
"7980860","7981500"," There."
"7985780","7994080"," Couldn't imagine like if you were short, like couldn't imagine being short, like 380 or something."
"7994400","7998840"," And you're just sitting here and you're just like you're just short at 380 supposedly. "
"8000520","8001160"," Asteric."
"8002640","8004040"," You weren't short at 345."
"8004960","8006140"," You weren't short at 360. "
"8007480","8009940"," I couldn't imagine being us being here right now."
"8011480","8018020"," And just like just like pleading with yourself like please close under 396 so I can just unfuck"
"8018020","8018380"," myself."
"8018660","8019380"," I wonder. "
"8020440","8021480"," I'll be honest with you."
"8021580","8021940"," I wonder."
"8024250","8024670"," I wonder. "
"8025850","8031600"," I wonder how many south side are like."
"8032780","8035080"," All we're going to do is try to get down to 3,800."
"8035920","8038880"," We'll tell them we're going to 3,600 or 3,000. "
"8039840","8041740"," Just long enough we don't fuck myself."
"8043380","8046060"," So I could just sit down for a minute and take a breather."
"8048580","8050960"," I don't care if we get to 3,600 or 3,000. "
"8051060","8051900"," I just went on fuck myself."
"8052700","8054480"," Get down to like 38, 20 or something."
"8055780","8056180"," And then boom. "
"8056960","8057640"," Get out of the market."
"8058880","8059800"," Something like that."
"8060600","8061220"," Some kind of insane. "
"8062120","8071150"," Because I'm assuming the 3800 crowd is like we're going to 3,000."
"8072350","8073150"," I don't forget."
"8073330","8075670"," I know a lot of social media forgets but I don't forget. "
"8078360","8080580"," Because I remember the target was 3,000."
"8081460","8084160"," So now it's like okay listen this is what I'm going to do."
"8084720","8085800"," Fuck 3,000. "
"8086220","8087760"," I'm going to tell them we're going to 3,600."
"8088580","8090700"," And then the moment we hit 3800 I'm out."
"8090880","8091580"," I promise I'm out. "
"8092420","8093680"," Bulls do that shit all the time."
"8094440","8096080"," On the upside bulls do that shit."
"8096220","8097740"," They're like okay I'm going in a million dollars. "
"8098300","8098960"," It's like a top."
"8100580","8102840"," And they're like I'm going to go on social media and tell everybody."
"8102840","8107400"," Let's say it's like Tesla at 1,000 when they buy the thousand bucks. "
"8108100","8109220"," I'm like I'm going to tell everybody."
"8109780","8110900"," We're on my upside down now."
"8110920","8112140"," We're now trading 900 bucks. "
"8112900","8115920"," And I'm going to tell every fucking bull I know we're going to 1,200."
"8116620","8123480"," And all they're waiting for is for that double test, that double top."
"8124100","8126380"," Then we get to 1,000 and they're like I'm out of here. "
"8127620","8128680"," I'm like woo."
"8129580","8130360"," I'm break even."
"8131720","8135320"," Meanwhile these other bulls are like yeah we're going to 1,200 and they get trapped. "
"8148840","8150540"," Some kind of nonsense like that."
"8157540","8158140"," Supposedly."
"8160920","8161520"," Reportedly. "
"8162860","8166800"," Let's say if I make 10,000 posts they'll probably forget."
"8168940","8174180"," If I make a thousand posts and I call the top again, it'll work this time."
"8178040","8178920"," I promise. "
"8180700","8183440"," I'm like what fucking broker is going to carry that shit."
"8186060","8187220"," And puts are cheap dude."
"8187340","8189220"," Someone was asking me. "
"8189420","8191660"," I think Superman was asking me something yesterday and I was like."

"8194600","8197260"," You normally if we're selling the market. "
"8198320","8199860"," It's so expensive to buy puts."
"8200400","8201680"," Right now they're fucking dirt cheap."
"8201840","8203900"," All in the last week they were rock bottom. "
"8208139","8209700"," Estile was dirt cheap right."
"8209940","8211400"," Estile was stupid cheap."
"8213459","8214600"," Stupid stupid cheap. "
"8214940","8215799"," Estile was that."

"8363540","8365440"," This is GME."
"8372440","8374900"," Ooh AMC is looking super. "
"8376840","8378540"," Looks like AMC already squeezed."
"8382379","8384680"," So AMC looks like it already squeezed."
"8385180","8386760"," So my PME is turned right now. "
"8397140","8399100"," BBBY is bottoming right now."
"8403240","8406040"," So there's GME right there 21 30 or so."
"8406800","8409000"," Anything above is take the money and run. "
"8411840","8412440"," BBBY."
"8414880","8415840"," Oh yeah."
"8420680","8424500"," If at any point BBBY can get above 164. "
"8435780","8437140"," 178 will be the target."
"8438440","8439620"," We'll come back and look at these."
"8444240","8446960"," This is BBBY passed a trade above. "
"8449380","8453860"," 164 and hold it and you'll get your squeeze to 178."

"8517840","8518600"," UNG."
"8523770","8524530"," UNG. "
"8524530","8531630"," You see this velocity slowing down on the downside on UNG."
"8532950","8535350"," Needs to get above 728."
"8536550","8537810"," Don't know if it'll happen but if it does. "
"8539310","8541430"," If UNG does get above 728."
"8542590","8543830"," If it can get above here today."
"8544610","8546730"," Like seeing this slowing velocity to the downside. "
"8547230","8548470"," If it is able to get above."
"8553550","8554070"," 780."
"8556030","8560200"," So right here. "
"8560300","8560860"," Big one here."
"8565120","8565900"," Right there."
"8566440","8569840"," Get another tag down below for this garbage down here. "
"8578020","8579700"," Keep your eyes on UNG."
"8581620","8584040"," You can't be a buyer until you're above here."
"8584640","8585480"," Buy or above. "
"8587660","8588500"," 730 or so."
"8588960","8592080"," From the top of the hour I would like you to see some more auctions for the US."
"8592080","8597540"," To the US selling 42 billion dollars in two-year notes with a private cover of 2 to 94. "
"8598000","8602420"," It starts the bloodbath at down United buyer but if it does work its way back up here."
"8602560","8604400"," We also see the US selling 30."
"8604580","8606420"," So the tag would be two week bills. "
"8606880","8611520"," A private cover seen at 2 to 87 with the prior high yield of 4 spot at 47%."
"8612000","8616300"," Looking to some analysts notes ahead of the two-year notes auction in particular here."
"8616300","8622120"," They say that positives for the sale include outright yield and strong demand for recent offerings"
"8622120","8622980"," in the tenor. "
"8623400","8627300"," The negatives include rising expectations for a fed rate increase in June."
"8627900","8630220"," Assuming moves in March and May as well."
"8630880","8634200"," We're also looking to the primary dealers positions in the two to three-year sector. "
"8634740","8641660"," It were net long 961 million dollars in the weekend in February 8th versus the average net short of"
"8641660","8644780"," 201 million dollars over the past year."
"8644780","8648160"," So quite significantly more than the average there in net longs."
"8648600","8653620"," We're also looking to CFTC positioning data which has been delayed since early February in"
"8653620","8657220"," connection with ransomware attacks on financial firm eye on trading in the UK. "
"8657840","8660440"," So no CFTC positioning data is available on this."
"8661900","8663760"," I'm up on my calls at this point."
"8664140","8665580"," I'm up 10 cents on my calls. "
"8667780","8668920"," I've got 20 contracts."
"8669300","8673900"," I bought a dollar and then I bought at a 70 support cents or something."
"8688700","8689340"," So I'm doing good. "
"8690680","8692620"," Winning trade so far for the day."
"8710130","8712210"," I've got 401c's right now."
"8712290","8714390"," I'd really like to see this 401 get tagged. "
"8715630","8718030"," I'd like to see bears hold."
"8721160","8722960"," What number do I want to see bears hold?"
"8723360","8728060"," I want to see bears hold past one at least."
"8728940","8733620"," If sellers can hold this, I'd like to see sellers. "
"8734280","8739800"," Well, I think sellers want to hold S2 on their minds they do."
"8741560","8743980"," They want to hold this and tomorrow for 396."
"8746000","8748800"," But I think sellers can hold this up here. "
"8748980","8754420"," I think sellers can hold 404 somewhere in here and still get the 396, 397."
"8754540","8757760"," This is probably like the probably like game over for the bears."
"8758380","8764580"," You know, we don't want to see bears don't want to see us trade above 404. "
"8765640","8766620"," That kind of stuff."
"8767040","8770900"," So I'll give the bears like 404 somewhere up up there is like a top."
"8772780","8774100"," They want to hold this, right?"
"8774360","8778280"," They want to hold somewhere in here to at least get that 396 down below. "
"8780620","8783660"," So my first target is just right here 40169."
"8784560","8789680"," The second target above is S2 of course and see it coming down right here."
"8791680","8798400"," But if we even if we go up here, I'd be willing to grab some puts for 396 down below"
"8798400","8802380"," somewhere in there. "
"8813680","8815650"," Remember we trade it before it happens always."
"8817660","8825820"," I could care less if you're a if you're selling bottoms or buying tops or any of that kind of"
"8825820","8826040"," stuff."
"8827580","8830700"," I have no interest in late news. "
"8831180","8831580"," I only want."
"8832680","8834360"," As it's happening, not after."
"8840360","8845980"," Yeah, so James D says, I wish Captain had a signal that showed if he was long or short in"
"8845980","8846660"," the corner of the screen. "
"8846800","8848100"," People have to leave and come back."
"8848560","8855660"," So James, I do have a widget that is going to come up on the screen that shows and I'm"
"8855660","8856900"," long and short and what I'm in."
"8857620","8860340"," It's not up on the screen yet, but it's I have one. "
"8860340","8866020"," It just hasn't been I just haven't put it up on the on the live stream yet, but you will"
"8866020","8867480"," get you will be getting that."
"8867860","8869080"," I do have that."
"8871570","8875890"," Well, I was going to wait now to the top of the hour again, the US due to sell $42"
"8875890","8880610"," billion in two-year notes and $34 billion in 52 week bills. "
"8881070","8884010"," Looking over the prior auction results for the two-year note sale."
"8884370","8889370"," Private cover was two to 94 with a prior high yield of four spot one, three, nine percent."
"8889370","8895110"," And for the 52 week bills, the private cover was two to 87 with the prior high yield of four"
"8895110","8896270"," spot four, seven percent. "
"8897230","8899290"," There's a just be careful air if you're long."
"8899330","8901130"," There could be one more touchdown below."
"8901490","8904810"," See this 400 and we talked about 400 being the level. "
"8905790","8909910"," Sometimes you'll see like the robots will want to get underneath 400."
"8909910","8911790"," So they see the little pin that pin drop."
"8912170","8913150"," Then we go higher. "
"8913550","8914510"," So just be careful of that too."
"8915650","8916590"," Say break 400."
"8918110","8920050"," They didn't get to break 400 right now. "
"8920110","8921190"," It's a very important level for bears."
"8925300","8926280"," But you'll see that."
"8926560","8929160"," So what happened was this weekend, I had to. "
"8929300","8931280"," So you guys want to know what happens behind the scenes."
"8932560","8935740"," I had I was looking at a ticker like so this ticker scroll right here."
"8936840","8938880"," Is kind of a low impact kind of a thing. "
"8939740","8942940"," But to get real time data in the stream is not easy."
"8943760","8950140"," And there's this program I can use that'll do a green screen on a different."
"8950960","8953340"," A green screen on a different display. "
"8954160","8956300"," And then I can do a display capture."
"8957120","8958860"," That makes it look like CNBC."
"8960260","8963720"," So like if you're like watching CNBC and you see all this like stuff going. "
"8965500","8968900"," And I can put in that that ticker stream."
"8968900","8971300"," Not this not this simple one."
"8971500","8973000"," It's like a stripped down version. "
"8973780","8978060"," But I can have like a lower third where it'll show what trades I'm in."
"8978320","8979860"," It'll update what trades I'm in."
"8980440","8982420"," When I've closed them when I've opened them. "
"8982900","8984000"," The price that I paid."
"8984800","8986860"," The price that I close at all that kind of stuff."
"8995890","8996370"," Yeah. "
"8998370","8999330"," Like an octagon."
"9000830","9007230"," Do you guys remember that move?"
"9008650","9009890"," It was bad ass."
"9010050","9012510"," They had like a bunch of ninjas with different colored ninja suits on. "

"9022970","9023890"," I've got 20. "
"9025150","9027070"," Twenty four oh one C's."
"9027570","9030890"," I think I bought it like a dollar and then I bought it like seventy four cents."
"9031770","9032630"," Added to them. "
"9036340","9038720"," So I'm just looking for a for retracement here."
"9038840","9041200"," Some kind of relief rally of some kind of the day."
"9046970","9047870"," Do you remember that?"

"9062730","9064290"," I want to go right around the woods with like a red."
"9064650","9066470"," Like a blue ninja and a white ninja."
"9068210","9069890"," I was all over that shit as a kid. "
"9070090","9071950"," Like a lone wolf McQuade."
"9072730","9076110"," I was into what I think that shit."
"9076110","9077250"," Like show Kazuki. "
"9079030","9079930"," Enter the ninja."

"9867820","9870580"," Into the mid to late 60s."
"9871960","9876460"," Comedians would make records like small records of stand up in small clubs. "
"9876500","9877580"," Not not stuff on TV."
"9878720","9879760"," And they would circulate."
"9880160","9882700"," So if you shut up to a to a stand up comedy hour. "
"9883040","9886300"," You go in there and get like a 45 and people would pass them off to each other."
"9886860","9892240"," And so you'd get like the stuff that you couldn't see on a TV show or on a radio show."
"9893820","9895940"," I don't I guess it would be like. "
"9897680","9899160"," It's tough to relate to today."
"9899460","9901960"," It wouldn't be like anything produced that you get right now."
"9902700","9905460"," You know what it would be like I used to go into comedy clubs in LA. "
"9907640","9911020"," And so in LA which really cool like one of the good parts of LA."
"9911520","9912780"," Is because it's industry."
"9913400","9914520"," It's like an industry city. "
"9915440","9916420"," There's a lot of bad parts."
"9916620","9917340"," Things about LA."
"9917600","9917840"," No offense. "
"9918100","9920080"," Any Los Angelenos out there."
"9920300","9922700"," But one of the cool parts of LA is."
"9924620","9925380"," Wherever you live. "
"9925600","9927160"," There's usually a local comedy club."
"9927360","9929480"," They call you like your local your local comedy club, whatever."
"9929640","9930560"," They're usually shitholes. "
"9931740","9933260"," And if you go there every week."
"9933860","9936440"," Now they have stand up nights that are brutal, right?"
"9937000","9942000"," Amateur hours and Samites people like famous comedians will run new content there."
"9943360","9944620"," Sometimes really late at night. "
"9945020","9948260"," And if you go regularly, sometimes you'll get a real comedian will come in."
"9948900","9950700"," And they know it's a shithole."
"9950980","9953340"," And they know that this is I don't know if they do this anymore. "
"9953620","9955260"," Maybe the age of cell phones they can't."
"9955360","9960500"," But before the age of cell phones, this was in the early 2000s."
"9960980","9963500"," You could go there and you would catch a famous comedian. "
"9963500","9967060"," And they would run or run."
"9969120","9970720"," Not content, but I guess."
"9971620","9974380"," I forget the word for it, but jokes for you. "
"9975180","9976740"," Some of them hit some of them didn't."
"9976840","9979740"," But it was hilarious because these guys were still really good at the craft, right?"
"9980080","9981300"," These women really good at their craft."
"9982660","9987360"," And they would they would just run shit by you for one, two, three hours. "
"9987580","9988040"," It was amazing."
"9989600","9992340"," Some of that maybe similar to that to an extent."
"9992920","9993640"," Yeah, material. "
"9993900","9994360"," That's what it is."
"9994460","9994700"," New material."
"9998240","9998720"," Yeah. "
"9999200","9999320"," Yeah."
"9999660","10005200"," I like comedy story and the laugh factory, but I'm talking about like the shitholes."
"10005480","10008040"," And there were some real shithole clubs. "
"10008380","10010080"," I'm trying to think of some of the places names right now."
"10010180","10011040"," I'm not a caring member."
"10011440","10012920"," But there were some real dives. "
"10017490","10017970"," Yeah."
"10018090","10019390"," Comedy sellers famous too."
"10020170","10022130"," Comedy sellers like legendary though. "
"10023530","10025130"," I mean, do you remember the time when."
"10025750","10026750"," Remember the time?"
"10026850","10031330"," Who was the guy that who was the guy that tried to break the longest stand up?"
"10031330","10033570"," I think it was Richard Pryor's longest stand up or something like that."
"10034210","10037150"," And so then Dave's fall came in and broke that record. "
"10038070","10039690"," That was at the comedy seller, I think."
"10040410","10041630"," Dave's probably been out for like."
"10042450","10044970"," Few years and then and then came back late one night. "
"10051830","10052710"," Oh, no kidding, huh?"
"10054190","10056890"," Yeah, there are some real dives that you can find that aren't done."
"10056970","10059650"," Anyone's radar and they'll come in and run new material."
"10063690","10066330"," But you saw Lewis CKE at the seller. "
"10069670","10070830"," I met Bill Hicks once."
"10071390","10072130"," I met Bill Hicks."
"10072130","10074010"," I was in the Federal Reserve facility. "
"10075350","10076470"," I met Bill Hicks once."
"10077830","10078670"," Yeah, it wasn't tough."
"10078850","10080150"," Paul wasn't trying to break the record. "
"10080430","10080950"," Someone else had."
"10081350","10083130"," Someone else had broken it intentionally."
"10083130","10085490"," And so he went back in to take it away from, right?"
"10090980","10091280"," Yeah. "

"10294400","10297360"," James Wall is asking for next support levels for Amazon and Google. "
"10297600","10298420"," We'll take a look at those for you."

"10337100","10337760"," here, man."
"10344840","10354000"," So Google could squeeze to 93.86. And then 96.21. Watch both of those. "

"10390340","10399000"," Just the normal stuff, 85.19. And then 83.20. You'll get no more bearish on Google above"
"10399000","10400820"," 105."
"10402100","10404180"," So if Google, currently it's about 105."
"10404900","10409260"," If Google gets above 105, you could try to restort it there. "
"10409400","10414920"," But if it consolidates there and moves higher, the market will go higher."
"10417220","10417520"," Let me see."
"10417680","10420580"," Let's find anything lower than that in just a minute here. "

"10537200","10537640"," You're a bear."
"10538640","10543160"," We break 3.96. If you're out there right now and you're tuning in."
"10544800","10545960"," I don't care who you are. "
"10547120","10552220"," If you're, whoever you are out there, you're ready for some lower targets."
"10553300","10558320"," If you're a bear, we break 3.96 with conviction and velocity."
"10560600","10569510"," You're looking for 3.31.67. 3.31 "
"10569510","10573610",".67 on spy. "
"10574250","10578310"," I did spy, I did Amazon, and I did Google."

"10609640","10616120"," then the target below that would be, I know someone out there is going to write all this down. "
"10617940","10627460"," Target below that would be $62.62. So you can kiss $95 right in the butt."
"10628260","10629880"," It'd be 141."
"10630600","10634060"," And then 62.62. Almost exact. "
"10635460","10641460"," 62.60. You'll still retest the hundred bucks down below $101 or whatever, but your target below"
"10641460","10646620"," would be $62.62. That's true."
"10660020","10661080"," It's fine, Lambs word."

"11671520","11675560"," I can't believe how crazy microcenter is."
"11676900","11683580"," And then when you go to the, when I go outside, just dropped off three computers there and it was"
"11683580","11686440"," 70 bucks just to look at them for each one."
"11687200","11692060"," And I still have, I still have the other tower that has to go down there to be fixed. "
"11692640","11694200"," And that's going to cost another 70 bucks."
"11694380","11695600"," So they already got me for 400."
"11711440","11713440"," 40 shop best buyer microcenter. "

"11849130","11852830"," $66, $70 on meta for a low. "
"11854310","11864190"," So if meta ends up breaking, you get a sell below $151, $151, $150 flat, and then a price"
"11864190","11865270"," target of $70."
"11865830","11873290"," Meta's pretty much there with Tesla in terms of if you get a continuation on the downside of meta,"
"11873890","11874610"," it's brutal."

"12704000","12705800"," Jim wants to buy the dip down here, 395."
"12707160","12708900"," So are you bearish here or bullish here?"
"12709120","12709440"," I want to know. "
"12715320","12716200"," 111 votes."
"12716780","12718540"," I'm going to give you guys two more minutes to answer."
"12723710","12725230"," Are you bullish or bearish here?"
"12726210","12727750"," I'm always fascinated by the answers here. "
"12729030","12729830"," I'm always fascinated."
"12732770","12734510"," You give me your answers, I want to know."
"12736490","12737710"," 130 votes right now. "
"12737730","12738250"," I'm doing pretty good."
"12739050","12741230"," I'm going to close it up here in about another minute or so."
"12741430","12742930"," So if you're listening in right now. "
"12744210","12745670"," Are you bullish or bearish here?"
"12747270","12747890"," Be honest."
"12749730","12756230"," I think this is a very good place for you to look yourself in the mirror."
"12759390","12760410"," Okay, how did 30 votes?"
"12760570","12761610"," I'm going to wrap up the question. "
"12761610","12762990"," Bring it really quick and simple."
"12764690","12767550"," Because I want to get a taste of who's out in the audience right now."
"12770770","12771590"," I'm going to end the poll. "
"12776620","12778020"," Oh shit, I did yes or no."
"12778320","12778460"," Fuck."
"12779400","12780560"," Okay, so you're bullish here. "
"12780700","12781720"," 35% of you are no."
"12782920","12785100"," I guess I asked the question the wrong way."
"12785820","12786560"," There's here no. "
"12786940","12789160"," So I know I'm like, what is the fuck that question?"
"12789420","12790660"," I guess I should have said bullish or bearish."
"12791000","12791860"," My bad, I fucked that up."
"12791940","12792680"," I'm not going to ask you again. "
"12793440","12794780"," But here's what my point here."
"12794960","12795900"," How do I fuck that up?"
"12796880","12797740"," So here we go."
"12798820","12799560"," There we go. "
"12799800","12800580"," We're making this really simple."
"12802260","12802700"," So."
"12804980","12806920"," Let me make this really simple. "
"12813760","12816340"," Okay, so we're going to review this one last time."
"12816440","12817260"," This is the last time."
"12818560","12819540"," Okay, let's look at this. "
"12820260","12821500"," Do you see price here?"
"12823140","12824960"," This is the S&P 500, okay?"
"12826220","12827840"," This is when the price was at 414."
"12831260","12834860"," Sorry, 14147.661, right?"
"12835660","12841860"," And so I'm telling you that the next five to six sessions are going to be down five to six"
"12841860","12842260"," sessions."
"12842800","12844640"," So here I'm bearish, okay?"
"12845240","12846100"," I want you to see that. "
"12846240","12847340"," You see that I'm bearish there?"
"12847520","12848520"," It's very bearish here."
"12849500","12851280"," I want to sell this down, okay?"
"12852220","12853740"," I'm trying to sell this down."
"12854460","12855100"," See what I'm saying?"
"12856140","12858240"," I'm trying to sell it down right here, okay?"
"12859080","12860820"," There is day, right?"
"12861900","12863020"," There is day, right?"
"12865540","12866820"," And then right here, right?"
"12868720","12870500"," We started actually selling down. "
"12870640","12871840"," You see how we're selling down here?"
"12873380","12874900"," You see how we sold down right here?"
"12875900","12878480"," And then if you see my arrow right here, right?"
"12878480","12880600"," I said, oh, we're going to go up to like 409."
"12881340","12882760"," You see 409 right there?"
"12883560","12884560"," Did we trade 409?"
"12885160","12886380"," We did on Friday, right?"
"12887420","12893020"," So then I'm like, yeah, I'm bearish down here to somewhere down here, 397, 395, right?"
"12893300","12893840"," Somewhere down in here."
"12894220","12894620"," You see that?"
"12895620","12897820"," So as we get down here, right?"
"12899200","12902100"," This is actually where the last post was right up there, right?"
"12902900","12903860"," So bearish. "
"12904580","12905420"," You see that?"
"12906560","12907000"," Bearish."
"12910560","12916040"," So oftentimes I'll get asked as we come down here, and people will tell you that I'm very bearish"
"12916040","12916540"," here, right?"
"12918140","12919960"," And I'm not bearish down here."
"12920040","12922420"," I start to look for a trade higher. "
"12922660","12923040"," You see that?"
"12923600","12924660"," So if that trade higher?"
"12925760","12926740"," Rejection on 404."
"12928060","12930300"," And then another trade higher, believe it or not."
"12930520","12934880"," Looking for another trade higher to take short above here, if you can get it. "
"12935040","12935520"," Does that make sense?"
"12936300","12941800"," So as we trade down here, right, you start to take your money and run as you come down here."
"12941920","12942700"," You see that down there?"
"12943720","12946140"," So when you're like, why is cap buying calls down here?"
"12946200","12949340"," It's because we sold this above, right?"
"12950940","12954640"," We sold this down here, and we sold this down here."
"12955380","12958340"," I can't be, I'm not going to join you with puts down here. "
"12959100","12967880"," So even if, even if we squeeze down below here, right, the capitulation move down here, even if we"
"12967880","12972480"," bloodbath down here, I'm looking for this squeeze higher, this giant squeeze."
"12973800","12982740"," So if you were not bearish at 414 or 420, if you were bearish for three months, right, you're"
"12982740","12984320"," probably losing these trades."
"12984460","12990420"," So as we come down here, if we come down even here, I'm looking for the calls there. "
"12990560","12993960"," I'm looking for a capitulation move and a squeeze higher in here."
"12993960","12996000"," So I'm not looking to get trapped in here."
"12997300","12999380"," Hopefully that answers the question for you. "
"13000680","13006280"," And if you just scale out, if you scale out just a little bit, I'm a dip buyer down in"
"13006280","13008660"," here, not a market seller down here."
"13009120","13009840"," Does that make sense?"
"13012920","13014120"," So maybe that helps."
"13022670","13024230"," Yeah, here's another good one. "
"13024570","13028910"," So Stephen Van Meters said the machines are selling under 4025, so it could be ugly."
"13028910","13034250"," You know, Stephen, I like Stephen Van Meters, but Stephen Van Meters couldn't hit a fucking side of"
"13034250","13036490"," a barn to sell the market."
"13040030","13045550"," Stephen Van Meters couldn't hit a fucking side of a barn to sell a market. "
"13046250","13048650"," So when you're down here, you're looking to buy a dip, this is my point."
"13053890","13054590"," Zero dates."
"13060200","13063460"," Yeah, so you're looking for dips to buy down here, not shorts. "
"13063460","13068180"," And if you are looking for shorts down here, you'll likely get burned at some point."
"13068420","13070620"," It's very risky to go short down here."
"13074880","13080120"," Yeah, I'm not going to argue with people like that with Stephen Van Meters out there. "
"13080200","13082060"," I can't argue with people trying to sell this market."
"13082980","13085840"," They are mostly wrong, 97% of the time."
"13086060","13089920"," And then by the time they're screaming and saying, look, I was right, it's the time to actually"
"13089920","13090580"," long the market. "
"13100750","13103570"," You guys are always in the wrong side of shit, man."
"13110240","13111120"," Exactly, exactly."
"13111740","13113460"," The time the show was mid last week, not here. "
"13114820","13116580"," I could care less about the next five minutes."
"13116840","13118100"," I care about the next day or two."
"13128660","13131880"," Yeah, I got no, I got no, I know how these things go. "
"13132520","13135220"," You squeeze like this fucking high in like five minutes."
"13137740","13139460"," And you'll be chasing that above."
"13139820","13142040"," You'll be in the chat saying, should I go long here?"
"13143200","13144340"," We have that on Friday. "
"13144620","13147980"," You can go right to Friday's broadcast, right?"
"13148720","13151540"," There are people that were like, should I take a long here at 409 in the clothes?"
"13151780","13152720"," And I'm like, you fucking crazy?"
"13153660","13154340"," Fuck no."
"13163990","13166170"," Bull's first bearish depends on time frames."
"13180450","13184370"," How do I handle the tendency at the market dumps quickly, but grinds up slowly?"
"13184670","13187490"," It doesn't tend to, or I guess, I guess what you mean. "
"13188910","13190850"," Maybe you're inferring something about gamma."
"13192110","13194350"," We're for negative gamma will squeeze higher."
"13194670","13196290"," If we're in positive gamma will grind higher. "
"13197190","13199270"," We're in negative gamma, so we should have a squeeze at some point."
"13203790","13206810"," Yeah, you should have, you should have shorted on Friday into the bell."
"13207810","13209150"," Or at least got put spreads. "
"13209750","13210650"," I think we talked about that too."
"13213700","13214580"," Yeah, I know it was Friday."
"13223150","13227870"," Yes, I think that's the only, the only issue here is when you're trying to short a top. "
"13229850","13231050"," You try to short the top."
"13231210","13234210"," When you're trying to get a bounce off a bottom, you start looking to buy bottoms."
"13248060","13251420"," Yeah, no, we were just long into 409. "
"13251480","13252200"," That was it."
"13253260","13254280"," Just long to 409."
"13255100","13256600"," I just showed you a fucking chart. "
"13256860","13257080"," Didn't I?"
"13257200","13258380"," That's like fucking a week old."
"13259240","13260540"," Failing 410, right?"
"13261000","13261760"," That was like a week ago."
"13262760","13266260"," I think that's actually, I think that charges exactly what the market has done. "
"13267300","13268620"," That's the only post I've made."
"13268740","13271080"," I haven't made any like, yeah, we're going up from here."
"13271320","13273280"," This is the bottom, any of that kind of stuff. "
"13276620","13278840"," Seriously, just stop with the doom."
"13279560","13282500"," Dude, I swear it, you sound like, I kid you not."
"13282720","13286700"," Some of you fucking bears sound like some of these fucking bulls, man. "
"13287220","13288740"," You guys blow my mind."
"13289380","13291380"," Like, I hear bulls say the same bullshit."
"13292220","13294840"," I had bulls telling me we're going up above 220. "
"13295820","13298140"," And they were all smoking crack and they all got trapped."
"13299220","13300660"," The same bullshit happens with bears."
"13301740","13305020"," Same, like, you guys need to be like, you guys need to be. "
"13305700","13307420"," Learn how to time markets better."
"13307620","13308780"," I got to be honest with you."
"13315480","13319960"," Yeah, no, I'm just looking for a debt to buy. "
"13320180","13321820"," I want to buy 395, 397."
"13323540","13324720"," Any of this stuff here."
"13325200","13327060"," There's one a standard 400 to get 396. "
"13329760","13330600"," You guys are insane."
"13330600","13333120"," I don't believe that."
"13333240","13335120"," I don't believe half of you make money in this market. "
"13335120","13335960"," I just don't."
"13336100","13337000"," I gotta be honest with you."
"13350380","13351660"," Everybody needs a dark period. "
"13368370","13370030"," Come on down, baby."
"13370730","13371950"," Come on down."
"13379660","13380020"," Yeah. "
"13389040","13390640"," Yeah, I'm just looking to buy a debt down here."
"13390680","13391760"," Anywhere I can buy a dip, I will."
"13401690","13402910"," I got a piss now. "
"13403330","13404690"," I get a pee really bad."
"13405290","13407190"," I do this with you guys every day where I got to take a piss."
"13408130","13408690"," And then I don't. "
"13410130","13411610"," Every day is like doom day."
"13413650","13416910"," Every day is where you're like, uh, every day is where you're like."
"13418750","13421610"," Every day is doom day where you're like, oh, the market's going to burn. "
"13428000","13433450"," Oh, you'll keep these animals in our day."
"13433590","13434070"," I know, dude."
"13434510","13435450"," Hold on a second here. "
"13437530","13439730"," I gotta, I gotta build a more position here."
"13450220","13451100"," Oh, yeah."
"13459620","13461060"," I think it's time for it to get a piss. "
"13470660","13472560"," So that's first target right there."
"13473940","13475360"," And next target's a 397."
"13478440","13479880"," It's right here next target. "
"13479880","13482760"," I don't know if I want to get this one here or buy this one right here."
"13503020","13504460"," I'll be right back in one second."
"13505120","13506620"," Like five seconds, I'll be right back. "
"13686220","13687340"," All right, I'm back, baby."
"13693110","13694090"," Hold on here."
"13695130","13696830"," I got something special lined up here. "
"13697150","13697870"," Hold on a second here."
"13699970","13701490"," I got something really cool for you."
"13704270","13705350"," Bull capitulation, baby. "
"13705690","13713650"," $3.99.03. We're going to do, um, I got something special planned for the bears today."
"13714670","13716210"," I've been working on this all weekend."
"13716810","13717890"," Just give me a second here. "
"13727060","13727820"," Hang tight here."
"13727900","13728500"," I got something for you."
"13735050","13736290"," I don't know if I can do that. "
"13736490","13737410"," Well, I'll show you this."
"13740010","13744250"," So I got this specifically for the bears and I haven't been able to show it, but I'm not going"
"13744250","13745690"," to put any music on just yet."
"13746550","13748830"," I've got a, let me see how I've got this song. "
"13749030","13749570"," Hold on a second here."
"13752640","13753360"," Hold on."
"13753520","13755460"," I think it's, I think it's on my Twitter. "
"13761000","13762360"," Hang tight, hang tight."
"13762440","13763100"," I was sitting in play this."
"13768750","13771710"," One of the, one of the followers of the show. "
"13778240","13779200"," Wait a minute."
"13780140","13780960"," See if I can see it."
"13790910","13798950"," Let me, uh, who sent me?"
"13799330","13800090"," Was it Dojo?"
"13800230","13800970"," Mania that sent it?"
"13803150","13803810"," Oh, yeah. "
"13804030","13804390"," Here it is."
"13804550","13804630"," Ready?"
"13807330","13810070"," Let me, I'm going to play this in the background because I got something cool for the bears."
"13813430","13814350"," Bear with me here. "
"13817860","13819040"," Oh, that's it right there."
"13834260","13835420"," Can you hear this out there?"
"13839590","13849720"," I think you guys can hear this."
"13856890","13858570"," That's what my bear is out there. "
"13880440","13882440"," This is a courtesy of the band."
"13882660","13885460"," Yes and no friends of the program."
"13885460","13889780"," He's known as Dojo mania on Twitter. "
"13890620","13896620"," He goes by the handle at d-o-j-o-m-a-n-a-n-i-a."
"13897380","13898720"," He's out of New York City."
"13911190","13914490"," He made this song song for the bears this week for us over the weekend. "
"13914490","13922180"," Can we get down here and get this three ninety-eight?"
"13922340","13922780"," It's the question."
"13923120","13924220"," Can we get down there?"
"13927780","13931140"," Three ninety-seven, it's three ninety-seven eighty-seven."
"13933690","13936550"," Three ninety-seven twenty-five is another place too. "
"13936850","13939210"," Three ninety-seven twenty-five right down in here."
"13939690","13941250"," Can the bears get down there?"
"13960710","13964130"," Why did I decide to override the white and red and white rule?"
"13964350","13964830"," I didn't actually."
"13965230","13967630"," So I bought my first set of calls I bought was right here. "
"13969150","13970090"," I bought those."
"13970970","13973930"," Told you about this rollover possibly happening right?"
"13975750","13978610"," Looking for some capitulation by bulls down here."
"13978810","13979630"," And what am I trying to do?"
"13979670","13981070"," I'm trying to buy a dip down here right?"
"13982090","13984250"," I want to trade this squeeze higher. "
"13984630","13985870"," Trade a squeeze higher."
"13986350","13987370"," Trade a squeeze higher."
"13987530","13988510"," I didn't even get my hands on. "
"13996160","14000460"," Chase man, you should have sent me this like five days ago bro."
"14003390","14006090"," Oh dude Dojo mania is in the house right now man."
"14006090","14007110"," I'm playing your damn bro. "
"14034970","14036370"," Waiting for months for this."
"14041450","14045910"," I've got 401 still and I'm about to add some more."
"14046450","14048110"," If we can get down here just a little bit more. "
"14048290","14050050"," I'm going to grab some more calls for the belt too."
"14054180","14055120"," There you go Dojo."
"14055220","14056100"," I played your damn bro. "
"14068470","14069690"," I was trying to keep it low in the background."
"14070030","14072670"," People say that they don't like the music too loud in their offices and stuff."
"14073730","14074810"," Yeah, that's plenty loud up. "
"14074910","14076310"," I turned it down in the background."
"14077550","14078350"," It's rock on."
"14087370","14089750"," Alright, so I just added some 400 C's. "
"14090510","14098750"," I've got a 3401 C's and I've got a 400 C at 34 cents and 10 pack of those."
"14099690","14102210"," And if I have to I'll buy some more right down here."
"14102370","14106070"," If we get down here to this low at some point today on zero dates. "
"14108440","14109100"," Did I play it man?"
"14109680","14110340"," I played it dude."
"14110340","14111860"," I thought that shit was jamming."
"14112160","14114200"," I listened to it earlier on Friday. "
"14114500","14117020"," I think there's your Friday and then you made another version of it."
"14124280","14127300"," Dude seriously stop with the collapsing now."
"14128140","14129440"," Stop with the collapsing. "
"14133610","14134890"," Stop with the collapsing."
"14140580","14141660"," You guys are crazy."
"14142160","14143880"," Anyone that says that is like. "
"14149230","14151250"," Let me bring this back up again."
"14151250","14153770"," So there's for the there's for the bears."
"14154350","14155630"," You got your disco ball. "
"14156150","14158530"," Every time we have a nice market capitulation moment."
"14158590","14161010"," I'll always break up the disco ball for the bears."
"14161530","14161970"," Congratulations. "
"14172490","14174450"," This is where the collapse comes in."
"14175430","14176850"," I thought the collapse is at 400."
"14177570","14179510"," I thought we were like having a collapse here. "
"14179950","14181970"," I thought we were going to the depths of hell at 400."
"14182270","14184330"," I thought that was called yesterday by a spot gamma."
"14185150","14186890"," That market collapse was at 4000. "
"14200080","14201180"," Market collapse."
"14201900","14203140"," We called it today."
"14203800","14207000"," Fucking those guys call market collapse fucking five days a week. "
"14229940","14233660"," I can't wait until I can't wait until Winky gets the."
"14234320","14236440"," I can't wait until Winky gets the."
"14236780","14243520"," I can't wait until Winky gets the counter alpha. "
"14243520","14245160"," When he gets that shit up."
"14245300","14247600"," Wait till you guys see what your."
"14247740","14249060"," Wait till you guys see what your. "
"14250440","14252720"," Wait till you guys see what your win rates are."
"14253700","14256360"," Some of some of y'all out there are going to be shocked."
"14257640","14259340"," Usually the lot of swans in the room. "
"14272170","14282280"," I know"
"14282280","14283020"," how you guys lose."
"14283380","14284200"," We already know like."
"14284320","14286020"," So Winky and I are already talking about it. "
"14288380","14289980"," We already talk about it in the background."
"14293570","14297110"," We usually hear the biggest screamers at bottoms and the biggest screamers at tops."
"14298890","14300470"," It's fairly easy to see. "
"14307010","14308450"," Oh, the Mike Wilson calls."
"14308910","14310490"," My God, dude, Marco has."
"14310850","14311590"," Marco has. "
"14311810","14314350"," Marco hasn't been right in like 20 years."
"14317350","14319850"," Mike Wilson's been calling for a rollover since."
"14320350","14322930"," Well, people are like, well, he said we're going to squeeze up in December. "
"14323210","14325750"," I'm like, yeah, that was after we started going up."
"14338480","14339580"," I use a."
"14339900","14342020"," I've got a tool here that shows call buying company."
"14342020","14342620"," You want to see it?"
"14346860","14347760"," I use a."
"14348180","14348920"," I use a."
"14350100","14351060"," A skew. "
"14352060","14352540"," Ratio."
"14361860","14362920"," Yeah, I'm bullish here."
"14363920","14366400"," I'm bullish here and I'm also bullish on tomorrow. "
"14366520","14367540"," I want to see."
"14369060","14371200"," I'm bullish here and I'm bullish down here too."
"14371800","14374880"," I want to buy this dip on the minute on the minutes tomorrow. "
"14374880","14379740"," I don't care if it's that 385 or 382 or 394."
"14379880","14381960"," I'm waiting for this dip buy down here for."
"14383600","14384340"," Well, shoot out. "
"14384440","14386520"," You guys want to see how I have a waiting for it?"
"14387040","14388220"," I'll show it to you right now."
"14389980","14395440"," Why I'm waiting for a dip to buy or why I've been waiting for a dip buy."
"14395740","14396500"," I'll show it to you right now. "
"14403060","14403880"," Give me just a second."
"14404020","14405140"," As a matter of fact, this is the."
"14407910","14410150"," This is the box that I drew for you earlier right here. "
"14416220","14417640"," I'm going to do this for you this morning."
"14417840","14419020"," You see it right there?"
"14419900","14422620"," I'll do that one for you this morning right down there."
"14426800","14427720"," I'll show you. "
"14427940","14429640"," Let me show you something down here."
"14435950","14436630"," Give me a second here."
"14439010","14440550"," I'll show you how I missed one of the. "
"14441750","14442790"," One of the dip buys."
"14460480","14461260"," Let me just second here."
"14495330","14497530"," I just need a minute here to get all this stuff up. "
"14508560","14511520"," I actually got some decent price acceleration today."
"14513580","14514640"," Hold on here."
"14525650","14528470"," I got some good price acceleration today. "
"14530490","14531910"," So here's the spy."
"14534210","14539490"," This is good price acceleration so that it downside bears want to see this."
"14539490","14540270"," They want to see. "
"14542490","14543670"," Price acceleration."
"14544010","14546010"," We haven't seen that in some time."
"14547090","14548930"," So if you're looking for. "
"14550650","14551910"," Matter of fact, this was a."
"14552170","14553550"," This was two big ones right here."
"14559040","14559860"," So I missed."
"14560220","14562420"," I got this dip buy down here. "
"14564660","14568300"," I got this one just fine, but I wound up missing this one right here."
"14568480","14570020"," So this one here ended up missing."
"14571480","14575140"," I wasn't able to grab call spreads on this trade right here. "
"14575140","14578100"," And we just blasted down."
"14578320","14581240"," You see that blast down and then was right back up, right?"
"14582720","14584460"," I didn't grab anything here."
"14585020","14587480"," I grabbed this one back here, but this was back in December. "
"14590580","14591720"," So I missed this one."
"14591760","14593520"," This was the one that I was pissed off at."
"14594880","14595640"," That I missed. "
"14596900","14600060"," I didn't take this trade either with call spreads."
"14600420","14602160"," I didn't buy any of that and I should have."
"14603160","14606880"," But now down here where we are, what's interesting is. "
"14607680","14610780"," We sold off today and we're not showing."
"14612300","14613460"," We're not showing."
"14614020","14617340"," We were seeing price acceleration to the downside. "
"14617460","14620620"," We're not seeing the market at zero at this point."
"14621820","14626500"," We've made some good progress down here, but still not where it needs to be."
"14627960","14631020"," So if you just look down below here, let me see if they can. "
"14633280","14635400"," I think that's all of it."
"14635520","14636360"," Make sure I get this right."
"14637740","14639100"," Can you see all that?"
"14639320","14640260"," Yeah, you can see all that. "
"14644860","14647600"," You got communications at 40%."
"14648820","14649700"," CND 35."
"14650620","14651480"," CNS 63. "
"14652600","14655240"," ENE energy at zero."
"14655860","14657480"," Finance is at 40%."
"14658260","14659700"," HLT is at 40. "
"14660100","14662080"," So we still have more room to run down below."
"14663020","14664540"," I and D's at 67."
"14665760","14667120"," MAT 37. "
"14668280","14673000"," The real estate area is 23 techs at 46 still on tech."
"14673840","14678500"," So tech still hasn't dropped its pants down here at 46."
"14678500","14680300"," Utility is still holding at 40. "
"14680680","14686720"," So we still haven't really seen true capitulation yet for the bulls."
"14687680","14690060"," We want to see more capitulation down here."
"14693280","14699580"," I'm interested to see if they can break below that 396 now at this point. "
"14700600","14706540"," What bulls wanted to see was less capitulation today and actually more tomorrow."
"14706540","14715800"," So we've got more today and price at least, price velocity in the way down, but not in breath yet."
"14716460","14718160"," So bulls are still holding on here. "
"14720560","14725660"," What I really like to see is bulls sell more and they haven't sold as much where we are right"
"14725660","14725920"," now."
"14726420","14727720"," So you probably haven't hit bottom."
"14728200","14730300"," This probably isn't at bottom yet. "
"14731240","14736240"," See how it says total 429 or 39%."
"14736240","14739580"," I always like to see is that like 21 if possible."
"14740380","14742220"," Like right around 21%. "
"14742220","14747160"," And so we're not quite there yet on capitulation for bulls at least."
"14748540","14751500"," Bull capitulation is usually right right around 19%."
"14751500","14752660"," We're pretty bearish there. "
"14753300","14755460"," 19%, 21% somewhere in there."
"14756280","14757780"," So I'm not still not seeing it."
"14758760","14761040"," I would like to see it at least by tomorrow. "
"14761760","14765780"," Some kind of a bloodbath down to these 393, 395."
"14766440","14770960"," Even if we were to blast down to the 80s, would make me happy as well."
"14771460","14776980"," You know, if you're a bear, you want to see like the rejection on 396 somewhere up in here, but"
"14776980","14777820"," still not seen it. "
"14778120","14780820"," Still not seeing the capitulation by the bulls down there."
"14780920","14786320"," There's still long this market, which I'm not surprised at either because puts are cheap, right?"
"14786960","14788360"," Puts are dirt cheap up here."
"14788440","14790900"," Long calls on an S tower were dirt cheap. "
"14791620","14795480"," So we're not still not seeing the capitulation by bulls in the market."
"14797080","14798480"," At this point, right?"
"14802910","14807290"," So we'll end up seeing one of watching this and seeing if we can get back down here into tomorrow"
"14807290","14808730"," for the minutes."
"14812520","14816280"," That's right down here, that 396, 395 area down here. "
"14817280","14825040"," If you want to be bearish down here though, if you are bearish down here, you want to see that"
"14825040","14830100"," break down below and the capitulation move down here."
"14830900","14835640"," But otherwise, this is all implied move down lower."
"14836740","14842980"," And to be honest with you down here, I'm actually trying to buy a capitulation dip with call"
"14842980","14847660"," spreads down here at some point. "
"14847880","14855880"," So put that back up for you."
"14858240","14863300"," Remember that people in stream earlier telling you that the market's going to crash here too."
"14863420","14868640"," I want you to remember that you've got people that will try to tell you in stream that we're going"
"14868640","14868880"," to crash. "
"14869620","14873600"," But at tops, we also have people telling you that we're going to, like last time people say we're"
"14873600","14874620"," going to 430, right?"
"14875260","14880280"," So you kind of ignore those people and you try to buy a dip and then you try to sell"
"14880280","14881060"," tops when you can."
"14888380","14894540"," You'll always hear, you'll always hear like, you'll always hear your lat, late comers screaming at"
"14894540","14895340"," bottoms and tops."
"14896400","14897580"," That's usually how it goes. "
"14914510","14920310"," Now we just sell minutes and then we buy, we sell the minutes we buy the, sell the minutes by"
"14920310","14921590"," the meeting always."
"14925260","14932200"," You're not going to see Vicks go crazy unless we trade outside of our implied range either."
"14932200","14941120"," So you need to get underneath that for that 395, 396, 397 to start to see Vicks start ramping up. "
"14941740","14944100"," Hopefully it'll be a moment where you get a capitulation down there."
"14945140","14950680"," We could get like, if we could get tomorrow like half a day of just bloodbath to 382 or something"
"14950680","14951240"," might be stoked."
"14952340","14954660"," Or a quick, quick rip down below would be nice too. "
"14976390","14978710"," Yeah, Dan Niles is a famous shorter."
"14979590","14984230"," When I'm, I actually, I usually trade, usually by the bottoms of Dan Niles."
"14985750","14988750"," I'm usually a big Dan Niles, I'm a big Dan Niles fan. "
"14989610","14993250"," He usually screams bloody murder that we're going to burn the market down."
"14994150","14999270"," And then three days later he comes out and says we're bearish here but I bought the bottom because"
"14999270","14999810"," we're oversold."
"15000590","15002110"," He's a big oversold buyer. "
"15008590","15010410"," And I think 6% is kind of low."
"15011290","15012750"," I think it might even go higher than there."
"15019370","15019790"," He does. "
"15020010","15024310"," He comes out usually, so what he'll do is he usually predicts really bad shit and then like three"
"15024310","15024890"," days later."
"15025350","15029110"," You can usually tell when you're near bottom because Niles will be like, he'll come out and just be"
"15029110","15030470"," like, it's bearish as possible."
"15031350","15035910"," And then like three days later he comes on CNBC and he goes, well I'm still bearish but we bought"
"15035910","15037950"," that bottom because it's oversold. "
"15038470","15043690"," And that's typically where I'm buying all spreads right around there."
"15047650","15049810"," Yeah, we all know Dan uses MBI."
"15050090","15050950"," We all know he does. "
"15051350","15053970"," I've been talking about that shit and stream for a year now, right?"
"15054170","15058610"," Two years about how Dan Niles comes out and they're like two days later, three days later."
"15059090","15062710"," He's on fucking CNBC and he goes, well I'm still super bearish."
"15063130","15066130"," But he's like, but I bought the fuck out of that bottom down there. "
"15079720","15080340"," It's true."
"15080560","15081520"," It's fucking true."
"15083380","15085000"," I don't know what more you want me to say. "
"15087890","15089870"," It's always like 15 minutes of rage."
"15095250","15096710"," Oh dude, how did that happen?"
"15099760","15102180"," Hold on, hold on, we're getting adult dating chats."
"15102860","15103540"," Hold on a second here. "
"15104720","15106300"," Hold on, let me get in there and fix this."
"15107520","15109760"," I thought I had subscribers only."
"15111930","15113710"," Maybe I don't have subscribers on. "
"15114950","15116350"," I did it kind of late today."
"15119560","15120560"," Let me look and see."
"15120760","15122960"," Maybe I don't have just subscribers can comment. "
"15124600","15127940"," Oh you know what, maybe the bot is overriding Winky."
"15128860","15134380"," Maybe the bot is overriding, oh you have to be a subscriber to comment."
"15137980","15139160"," It might be the bot. "
"15143380","15148080"," Remember people were in this stream just a few minutes ago telling you to sell this market here."
"15150340","15151800"," So I need to remember this."
"15152500","15154660"," We do this every fucking time. "
"15156780","15160080"," I'm up now on my 400 C's, I'm up 100%."
"15161220","15163480"," My 401's are coming back to life."
"15165260","15166680"," Jesus fucking Christ. "
"15166680","15171260"," I can't fucking believe how this goes."
"15175350","15178970"," I'm up 100% almost on my 400's."
"15179210","15185790"," I'm pretty much flat here at this point between the 401's and the 400's. "
"15186490","15188930"," Let me look at details."
"15196900","15205360"," I think Ty Winky, I'll look into it from my side man."
"15207160","15217050"," Yeah, so I've got only subscribers can comment Winky,"
"15217330","15219130"," but that's from YouTube side. "
"15219350","15228840"," I think that the override comes from the stream lab side where they do the, like we're, like I"
"15228840","15235970"," think that stream lab's mod, the stream lab's bot allows anyone to comment without being a"
"15235970","15236310"," subscriber."
"15238250","15242150"," And then once they join, they get their free stinks and stuff like that."
"15272410","15274150"," Who's the stream lab's that it's only feds?"
"15282730","15288350"," Now, I think what it is, it's, we've never had, we've never had a Russian bots here for a while. "
"15288510","15296470"," I think what it is is we didn't have Russian bots when we didn't have Russian bots when YouTube was"
"15296470","15297310"," running the stream."
"15298110","15306350"," And now we've assigned the running of the stream over to a new bot from stream lab."
"15306570","15310550"," So I'll just go, I think Winky or I'll just go in afterwards and we'll just look at it. "
"15310610","15316410"," I think that the YouTube bot, I think the stream lab's bot allows non-subscribers to comment."
"15318670","15333170"," So what you have to do is, what you have to do is, is you have to, what you"
"15333170","15337390"," have to do here is, I think what we have to do is make everybody a subscriber."
"15338170","15344090"," So when they subscribe, they just get some points and shit and then that's how it has to be made. "
"15352260","15354160"," Yeah, you saw that right, right, right, John?"
"15359600","15359920"," Okay."

"17356600","17362340"," We're doing this right now captain I don't know if this is right now, and I could care less if"

"18772630","18781090"," you're bearish here I Think I don't think I'm one of the some I'm one of I think once we"
"18781090","18788170"," slip under if we get enough velocity on the downside If we slip under that 396 We have a chance"
"18788170","18792270"," for a crash We have to we have to get it with velocity."
"18792730","18801270"," There's like a there's like a big part of there's like a big part of Hey, let me This was"
"18801270","18804010"," my only bone that I had to pick with here. "
"18804110","18811430"," Let me show you some The only bone that I had to pick with Well, I too bone I have"

"18825030","18837290"," I am I have"
"18837290","18846210"," a bone to pick though a price Or with the numbers on price I have a problem with it And"
"18846210","18852890"," then I have a problem with velocity, so Here's my here's my take on that stuff you want to see"
"18852890","18862750"," so It's kind of a garbage charge to be looking at right now When you"
"18862750","18865330"," see this big blue line right here, right?"
"18867930","18875870"," When we get caught underneath it If you don't see velocity on the downward move here We have a"
"18875870","18880450"," tendency to squeeze major squeeze higher, okay?"
"18881650","18887770"," Same thing down here, right start to make our way back climb ourselves back above same thing"
"18887770","18893870"," happened down here That we climbed ourselves up Same thing up here, but really needs to happen for"
"18893870","18902070"," bears is they need to break below this 396 With conviction they like need to break this They need"
"18902070","18911550"," to turn this into some kind of resistance here until they do that Until they do that right there's"
"18911550","18920770"," no crash scenario crash scenario here they need to like tee off of this Right that"
"18920770","18929090"," 3300 that 3600 but even so like You got to understand that When you're like you guys have to"
"18929090","18934590"," understand that even with that even if we go down to those lows I don't know what the wind is"
"18934590","18935130"," here for bears."
"18935290","18942270"," I'm trying to try in my mind here to try in my mind here to You know if you look"
"18942270","18945930"," back in three years is this is this the last leg down here?"
"18948550","18955010"," You know if it is I've done quite well here I bought tesla hair I'll buy tesla hair again So"
"18955010","18962890"," I'm trying to figure out what the game or the endgame here is like what is a market crash What"
"18962890","18969230"," is a market crash we're at 345 over here So is that an actual market crash?"
"18969730","18978730"," I don't know I'm trying to figure out what the like you hear people saying stream saying Right now"
"18978730","18981590"," chase just said we'll get a market crash down here. "
"18981710","18982890"," It's like what is market crash?"
"18984170","18986330"," Is it a 3200 3300?"
"18987710","18992550"," That doesn't sound like a crash to me This looks like we're trading sideways, right?"
"18993770","18998790"," As a matter of fact if you hit 430 you're likely going to see 440 or 460, right?"
"19000250","19007990"," So I don't know I'm assuming that bears are going to say this is The mark I don't know last"
"19007990","19008930"," market crash though."
"19008930","19014290"," I'm trying to figure out what a bear is saying here And if this is last market crash for they"
"19014290","19017070"," step in To buy up before you even get there."
"19017310","19018350"," They just say fuck it. "
"19018450","19021470"," That is the crash The buyers just step in and buy it."
"19021590","19028330"," The timing doesn't sound right to me It doesn't I Really like to see the market crash happen end of"
"19028330","19033170"," year You'll probably hear people you had Mike Wilson say this would be the last leg down the bear"
"19033170","19033490"," market."
"19033810","19035530"," So what does that mean for?"
"19036830","19038330"," What does that mean for bears?"
"19039490","19041230"," Does it mean that Mike Wilson's wrong?"
"19041810","19049810"," I don't know I Don't know the answer to those questions unless we're there Unless we trade there"
"19049810","19055130"," and we're fucking trading 400 right now We're not trading fucking 345 we're trading for fucking"
"19055130","19059230"," hundred people like we're getting mark crash like bro We've been crashing since fucking June. "
"19059290","19066570"," It was like we're just you're pointing out numbers like you're pointing out numbers of 3600 I'm"
