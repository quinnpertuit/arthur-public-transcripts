"75890","76570"," two, my check."
"91780","93000"," Check one, two."
"94500","113370"," You guys"
"113370","114090"," doing out there?"
"129449","131190"," Oh, yeah, what's going on out there?"
"131290","133490"," You guys ready to do this, baby?"
"134930","136550"," Oh, I see Chad right now. "
"138310","138790"," What?"
"139230","140970"," What is going on out there?"
"143190","144710"," Good morning."
"145670","147150"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"147410","147890"," This is kind of weird."
"148430","149470"," I haven't seen this setup yet. "
"150990","152430"," Oh, yeah."
"152850","155570"," Good to see all of you in here right now."
"155790","156130"," Go, boy. "
"156270","157010"," What's going on?"
"158350","159130"," Hold on here."
"159210","160330"," Let's see what we got going on here."
"161190","162930"," Hold on here. "
"163670","165510"," We got market opening in one minute, right?"
"168550","175230"," We have a bother with the morning brief, or we go straight into the opening bell here."
"175350","177050"," Let's just go to the main screen right now."
"178330","179350"," Switch right over. "
"179470","179730"," Here."
"179910","180930"," Turn that off."
"182550","184550"," What are you guys doing this morning?"
"186430","187690"," Turn all this up. "
"187770","188790"," We'll come back to that later."
"191310","193330"," Just one quick second here."
"196910","199490"," You're all looking for that squeeze higher this morning. "
"207430","218620"," Let's see Hold"
"218620","218920"," on here."
"218940","219920"," I'm getting phone calls."
"220000","221900"," Phone is blowing up right now. "
"268700","269500"," All right."
"269680","270800"," I apologize for that."
"271300","272700"," That was Joe Donut. "
"273040","275960"," He was just confirming that he'll be on the show this morning."
"276740","278240"," So let's do a quick."
"279280","281000"," It's been a while, right?"
"281180","281540"," It's been a while. "
"282440","283760"," It's going to take a moment here."
"284000","287940"," Let me see what's going on over on Twitch really, or what's the other..."
"287940","288140"," Oh, yeah."
"288200","288520"," It's Twitch. "
"289240","291560"," Let's go check out what's going on in Twitch here really quick."
"292600","294920"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"295040","295800"," How are you all doing?"
"297720","298380"," No, no. "
"298480","299980"," We're not doing any ads right now."
"300080","301180"," Turn those ads off."
"301380","304480"," We're all doing incoming ad break on Twitch right now. "
"304740","306040"," We're doing that right now."
"306260","307400"," Turn those ads off."
"307780","309080"," Start turning the ads off. "
"310080","311560"," Let's start turning the ads off."
"312040","312320"," Okay."
"312480","312920"," So here's the deal. "
"313240","316000"," Let's get a little quick market brief out of the way."
"316000","317000"," Turn the ads off."
"317000","318260"," Just on price right now. "
"319520","320120"," Hold on."
"320200","320780"," I got to turn this."
"320920","323160"," I can hear me in the background, the volume's on. "
"323980","325740"," I'm going to get all this stuff ready to go."
"326640","327380"," Good morning."
"327540","328840"," I'm going to get swear. "
"331620","332820"," I miss all of you."
"332940","334820"," How are you all doing out there?"
"335980","336600"," I really do."
"336700","345980"," I miss you guys more than you know. "
"345980","346480"," I'm going to get back as well."
"346680","352220"," You know, three years and no real breaks either."
"352540","356520"," We looked back at all the live streams we've done around here and it was insane. "
"357760","361700"," You know, most of these shows they go off or they don't do eight hours a day or six and"
"361700","362740"," a half, eight hours a day."
"363420","366520"," Or they don't just don't do it."
"366620","368240"," If they do it, they take big breaks. "
"369760","371680"," People that do live stream that much."
"371680","373700"," So this is our first one."
"374040","376800"," So it's kind of like a hotel, you know, or an airplane. "
"377240","381200"," Well, maybe not Boeing, but you take a break."
"382200","384420"," You vacuum the carpets."
"384420","385520"," You change the shades. "
"386920","390840"," You upgrade some of the equipment and that kind of stuff."
"392060","393080"," So that's what we did."
"393120","399080"," We took some time off and we tested a bunch of new stuff and tried to do some work on"
"399080","399400"," the show. "
"399400","400980"," This looks kind of crazy right now."
"401160","410080"," You can't really see too much here, but if you switch over to something like that right there, you"
"410080","413060"," can kind of see that there's a bunch of lights on the wall back there."
"413360","419100"," I got like fog machines and class two lasers and a bunch of other stuff that you guys are going"
"419100","422580"," to be able to control from the chat at some point. "
"422580","425380"," It's not quite finished yet, but what was that?"
"425840","427340"," Was that a screen transition?"
"427820","429800"," It wasn't a screen transition, wasn't it?"
"431000","431760"," Oh, yeah."
"432020","432380"," Look at that."
"432740","433180"," Ooh. "
"434880","435320"," Ooh."
"436540","437340"," What was that?"
"438800","439820"," That was saucy."
"442180","443900"," You know, I got to do something here. "
"443980","444260"," Give me a quick."
"444360","446260"," I got some I keep getting disconnected here."
"447500","452780"," So I might have to switch accounts to the other pro account down there. "
"453480","453960"," Sorry."
"454080","454960"," I can already see we got issues."
"458870","460250"," What's going on out there?"
"460430","461410"," Stop resubbing. "
"463510","464810"," What are you doing out there?"
"464970","465670"," What are you dropping that?"
"465990","466330"," What's that?"
"468670","473550"," Keep getting someone just logged in from a different device."
"473550","475950"," I don't know what's going on here with trade and view."
"477070","478190"," Hold on one second here. "
"478250","479750"," I've probably got something I've got to do here."
"482450","484410"," Let me see if I can do this over here."
"485590","487670"," Anyway, so here's the deal this morning. "
"488650","490810"," We'll do real quick synopsis here."
"492890","496590"," So we are sitting on the pivot point this morning."
"497750","505050"," Now, just so you know here, if you haven't seen this before, we do have a couple of things. "
"505210","505910"," I have a pivot point."
"507830","513429"," I was thinking about gamma on my time off."
"514870","517090"," Someone asked me to explain gamma to them. "
"519150","523610"," I made a crude comment and they didn't take too kindly to it."
"523750","528830"," I said, you know what I like about gamma is it's a nice reference point."
"529250","531170"," It reminds me of pivot points. "
"532430","534290"," You can have traditional pivot points."
"534490","536590"," You can have Fibadacci pivot points."
"538390","541910"," People got their hands around gamma and they were able to sell it as a concept. "
"543550","545510"," It's just another pivot point in my view."
"546970","552190"," We don't really like that comment, but it's kind of powerful to say that."
"552310","553750"," He said, well, can you explain it to me?"
"554810","555910"," If it's that simple. "
"557750","563130"," I said, you know, I had gone down the gamma rabbit hole for a couple of years, at least a"
"563130","563710"," year or two."
"563870","564890"," I was all over a fin to it too."
"564970","566390"," I think going like, this is awesome. "
"567350","571150"," What I found was that I was wrong a lot still, or something."
"571810","575890"," I get real money buying, a real money selling that would overpower the gamma market, right?"
"577050","579970"," You'd have dealers stepping in and I would not know."
"580530","582850"," Why is a dealer coming into the scene right now?"
"584050","587030"," Retail sentiment coupled with real money selling, right?"
"587670","588890"," All these different factors, right?"
"589250","591650"," Events, dealers chasing, stuff like that. "
"591910","593810"," I get caught on the wrong side of trades."
"593810","598410"," So I started to use gamma as more of a pivot, right?"
"598630","599470"," Where are we with gamma?"
"599890","601110"," Where's price in relation to gamma?"
"601630","602910"," We're heading up, we're heading down."
"603330","604430"," It's fairly simple, right?"
"604550","607230"," You're going to run some resistance for some support. "
"607810","612270"," Now the crystal ball becomes, does that support hold?"
"613610","615310"," Does that really break through that resistance?"
"616110","619850"," You know, regardless, most times we still bounce on it."
"620870","623370"," Sometimes we blast right through, but it's not that common."
"625510","632070"," And, uh, pivot, traditional or Fibonacci, all reminders. "
"632610","635990"," So, when I were talking and he was like, what does it mean to you that it doesn't mean anything?"
"636170","636730"," I said, well, it does."
"638170","647310"," I said, pretend in your field of vision, you know, time trading, you can layer"
"647310","654290"," in your mind, you know, a layer of gamma, a layer of traditional pivots, a layer of Elliott wave, a"
"654290","659730"," layer of this, a layer of that, and you can see through all of them at the same time, that"
"659730","663490"," it starts to give you a cleaner picture of where we're heading, right?"
"663570","666610"," As you bounce up and down and back and forth between all of these pivots."
"667130","672330"," And if you're aware of all those things, it makes consuming gamma a little bit easier. "
"673490","678370"," It's like, you know, to me I call it dumbing things down, but it's not always like that."
"678370","683930"," So, right here is a, is a, uh, pivot table here, right?"
"684670","687670"," I've got these set to traditional and not Fibonacci."
"688150","690690"," That's these lines to this yellow line, this white line. "
"692170","697790"," And I had a friend tell me, uh, did you know that people pay for pivots?"
"698210","700210"," I was like, no, get the fuck out of here."
"700590","705030"," He's like, I'm telling you, people pay five bucks a month just to get pivots from people."
"705510","706410"," I was like, that's insane. "
"706630","709030"," That's like a foundational concept in trading, right?"
"709650","710070"," It's foundational."
"711770","714690"," There's no way they'd be paying five bucks a month for pivots."
"715490","716990"," So I was told, yes, that's true. "
"717210","718030"," So I was like, well, fuck it."
"718110","719730"," I'm going to start giving away for free every morning."
"720570","721210"," So we did. "
"721770","723350"," Uh, we gave him away free every morning."
"723470","726970"," And then my, uh, uh, uh, I think his name's Perf."
"727350","727750"," Bevel. "
"728030","733210"," I'm not hacking his name, but he did a post about gamma and, uh, how to do your own gamma."
"733690","734570"," So I started doing that."
"734570","736750"," I was doing it with my daughter. "
"737450","742150"," And, uh, asked her if she would, uh, help me post levels every morning, pivots every morning on a"
"742150","743610"," handle called Captain's Alpha."
"744230","744730"," So we did."
"745410","746530"," Let's get it every morning. "
"747130","752870"," And, uh, I was like, man, let's start making videos."
"752890","755670"," And we started doing live streams and we're giving away all the stuff for free."
"756430","759430"," And my promise was always to keep it free forever. "
"760010","769930"," Uh, so, uh, from posting Excel pivots every morning at Captain's Alpha, we now"
"769930","774070"," offer, uh, an expanded every morning."
"774150","779150"," You get your levels and your pivots every morning now for free for the entire market, not just of"
"779150","781810"," nine or 10 or 11 symbols."
"782570","785010"," You know, it can seem like such a basic, simple, stupid thing. "
"785750","787910"," Uh, what, why do levels matter?"
"787910","789030"," But they're foundational."
"789670","794910"," If you were to have just a chart up with nothing on it, uh, it would, might not be intuitive"
"794910","801130"," for people to look at in previous time frames for, uh, moments of interest, right?"
"801610","805310"," Or where we pivoted the day before, the week before, the month before, the quarter before."
"807150","810910"," And, uh, the significance of those things and how important and foundational they are. "
"811390","813950"," How important and foundational they are to, to learn gamma."
"814730","818910"," Uh, early away for Fibonacci retracements or extensions."
"819870","823890"," Uh, all that stuff is foundational to, uh, pinpoints. "
"825070","831110"," And, um, the previous days highs, the previous days lows, the previous weeks highs and lows gaps,"
"831350","832050"," all that kind of stuff."
"833170","834410"," So I'm really grateful."
"835630","839690"," Well, that not only is that not ended, but it's expanded. "
"839690","843850"," And it's free for as long as that site, the website is up forever."
"844410","846230"," We're going to add a couple more tools on there too."
"846310","848150"," We've got two or three already in the fires of big ones. "
"848950","851310"," Uh, to always help a retail trader out."
"851510","854330"," The second thing would be live stream, always on."
"855210","856390"," You guys like that, right?"
"857270","858550"," And, uh, I like it too. "
"858810","862510"," It keeps me busy, keeps me, uh, you know, working, all that cool stuff."
"863170","866750"," And I've formed a lot of friendships with you people out there over the years."
"867250","868950"," Uh, those friendships matter to me. "
"869230","873410"," As a matter of fact, while we weren't live streaming, I was in a development discord for the past"
"873410","873890"," few weeks."
"873890","875810"," And we were in there all day long together."
"876290","876750"," And it was awesome. "
"877390","880350"," Uh, these are my friends, these are the friends that I've made over the years."
"880350","884430"," And it was really nice to work, uh, next to these, uh, friends of mine."
"885610","886930"," The last part is the discord. "
"888270","890430"," Oh, look at that drop on cues, baby."
"891170","893930"," Uh, so the last part was the discord, right?"
"894130","895230"," We're trying to keep that for free."
"895230","897230"," That we haven't been successful with. "
"897830","902690"," Uh, you can't, you kind of pushed into doing a paid model and the safety of our community."
"902910","907530"," And the people that are in there, uh, helping out day in, day out, stuff like that."
"907870","914410"," So we're going to relaunch with, um, a paid entry level membership. "
"914530","914770"," Okay."
"915010","917110"," It's, uh, 30 bucks if you pay it for the year."
"918770","924350"," And it covers way more than just now the discord and the chat, but it doesn't include the chat, the"
"924350","924670"," discord. "
"924670","930270"," Uh, includes, uh, trigger charts every morning for like, I don't know, nine or 10 or 12."
"930930","934550"," Things we got like a, we have like a discord with like a bunch of premium bots in there."
"934630","936950"," I think trade ticks, unusual wheels, bunch of other cool stuff. "
"937550","943390"," Uh, we have dedicated 24 hour live support and it's not open to anybody to get in there anymore."
"943490","946470"," No more nefarious people, no more scammers, no more bots."
"946770","951290"," We had actually, we had actually abandoned the last discord and started brand new and rebuild it. "
"951290","954990"," From scratch, uh, past a couple months here."
"955170","957690"," So we're very excited about that as well."
"959390","962610"," Now, I feel like a cap, I never, I'm never paying for nothing. "
"963050","966690"," Uh, you're going to get your levels still every morning, your live stream every morning."
"966690","973290"," And if you want to only chat, you can go to Amazon prime gaming, sign up there to chat."
"973990","975870"," And you get your chat in your live stream. "
"975990","979350"," The only thing that I can offer you anymore is I can offer you a free discord."
"979350","980270"," We tried that."
"980410","983230"," We had, uh, thousands and thousands of members. "
"983530","984850"," I mean, we were cutting back."
"985410","990250"," If you weren't active in a month, we cut you back, but we were at like two, three, four, five"
"990250","990650"," thousand."
"990770","994630"," Then we'd cut down a thousand and we'd add another thousand and cut down another thousand. "
"994630","995150"," It was crazy."
"995670","999690"," So, um, I hope this is a better iteration."
"999690","1001730"," You guys have a much better time there. "
"1001810","1003990"," And I'll be there spending more time with you."
"1004410","1005650"," Uh, so I'm going to have it up."
"1005650","1009350"," It's up right now in my, my, uh, in front of me and I will be in that discord. "
"1009950","1013390"," Uh, letting you know what my trades are and what trades are coming up and that kind of stuff."
"1014090","1015490"," Uh, rather than here on stream."
"1015710","1017390"," So I'll be hanging out with you guys in there as well. "
"1018130","1018670"," What else?"
"1023140","1023980"," Good morning, Chase."
"1024380","1024839"," How are you doing?"
"1025700","1026640"," Good morning, Matt."
"1026839","1028180"," John Hagerty. "
"1029040","1030000"," What's going on, baby?"
"1030680","1031300"," Groundhog day."
"1032500","1033660"," Floyd's garage here."
"1034540","1034960"," Brandon Lucas. "
"1035339","1035700"," Good morning."
"1037000","1038180"," Stacey F's in the house."
"1038400","1039099"," Andy Nelson. "
"1040000","1041500"," What's going on, Andy Nelson?"
"1041960","1044400"," STT Voyager in the house this morning."
"1045020","1046300"," Cannot be helped here."
"1046880","1047520"," Hey, dog. "

"1084620","1085020"," It's 30 bucks."

"1120640","1120940"," Anywhere."
"1123020","1126440"," We're trying to get same moderators, new moderators. "
"1126440","1127500"," Wherever you guys want to do."
"1128160","1134080"," There is a thing down here that explains exactly what you want to be doing."
"1134260","1139540"," You want to be getting into the Discord and contacting Bork or sending him an email so you can talk"
"1139540","1140100"," to him. "
"1141420","1149580"," Because we're tying chat to our membership, we had to remove moderators and then reinstitute them."
"1149580","1153500"," And I think some of you are more VIPs than mods as well."
"1153680","1157820"," I know that some of you guys do alpha inside of our chat. "
"1158200","1160460"," So get in touch with Bork McGork."
"1161100","1167660"," Reach out to him via either YouTube, Twitch or inside the Discord or via email or whatever on the"
"1167660","1167900"," website."
"1171380","1172580"," What else do we have here?"
"1174880","1175740"," Dibang, good morning. "
"1175940","1176240"," How are you?"
"1178180","1179500"," What else do we have this morning?"
"1179500","1181940"," I think we should give away some memberships."
"1184120","1187540"," Alright, so we are on the hourly trigger."
"1187980","1190300"," We are below the pivot point right now. "
"1191200","1197080"," We have dip buyers stepping in on NVDA currently at 772-73."
"1198500","1202380"," SPX on the gamma side of things down in the bottom left hand side of your screen."
"1203940","1208240"," If you take a peak here at this 19 million here, this little green line. "
"1208240","1210680"," That is market support."
"1211100","1215480"," So the buyers are stepping in right now on market support."
"1215820","1221000"," If they lose that support, I would expect us to trade much lower here. "
"1221220","1224800"," We're talking about probably closing this entire gap down below here."
"1225360","1227520"," Let's see if we can switch over there really quick."
"1230340","1234360"," So just on this gamma down here on the right hand side, I want you to see this. "
"1234900","1237520"," You see the dip buyers are stepping in right now."
"1237520","1242820"," If they lose that support, we will likely close this entire gap down here to the down side on the"
"1242820","1243860"," gamma flip, okay?"
"1244100","1246700"," Maybe squeeze back up and find out if we're going to hold support."
"1247520","1249820"," So just keep your eyes on SPX this morning. "
"1249980","1250660"," Hold on there."
"1250940","1255680"," Keep your eyes on SPX this morning and see if these dip buyers are successful."
"1256120","1258780"," If they are, how do you know and how do you trade it?"
"1259440","1261200"," So we're going to go back to the main screen here. "
"1262760","1265240"," And you're going to know if this holds."
"1265240","1267560"," This is where your support and your buyers are, right?"
"1267780","1268900"," We're going to trade above this."
"1269360","1271240"," You can take a long. "
"1272040","1272800"," Hold on here."
"1273260","1274140"," I'm freezing here."
"1275740","1279560"," So just in here, if you're a long trip, if you're a bull, right?"
"1279820","1287220"," You're trying to buy above this 50687, close the gap or close the previous eye back here. "
"1287700","1291460"," And then come back down and retest that for another move higher over here."
"1291460","1296220"," If this is lost down here, we're going to go lower and close a bunch of gaps down below."
"1296680","1297580"," So just keep your eye here. "
"1297660","1299320"," You shouldn't be long here if you're a bull."
"1299840","1300760"," You can be."
"1301020","1301780"," I wouldn't recommend it. "
"1301920","1304700"," I let the price action show you the way this morning."
"1305260","1307940"," If we begin, though, to sell down, right?"
"1308100","1312380"," You're looking for a break of this prior low right here, okay?"
"1312980","1314060"," So just right back here."
"1314160","1319300"," If you start to see us reject, if you start to break down, we can look for an opportunity to"
"1319300","1323100"," buy some puts or short the market, sell S&P 500, whatever. "
"1323640","1324500"," So right now, you don't do anything."
"1324700","1326900"," You just kind of sit on your hands and watch this price action."
"1329560","1331940"," Watch those dip buyers step right in an NVDA. "
"1331960","1332600"," They don't even care."
"1332800","1334740"," They're just like, look at this chart down here."
"1334800","1335920"," They're just like, this is a half hour chart. "
"1336600","1337840"," The buyers are like, it's all mine."
"1338040","1338420"," We're doing it."
"1342200","1342860"," Hold on here. "
"1342940","1343440"," What do you guys get?"
"1346620","1347340"," H-bomb."
"1347520","1348160"," Good morning, brother."
"1348300","1348920"," Good to see you. "
"1351600","1352420"," All right here."
"1354580","1355500"," Everybody's here this morning."
"1355660","1356640"," You got everybody in the house. "
"1360880","1362080"," What's going on this morning?"
"1362180","1363540"," It's good to see everybody out there."
"1364280","1364800"," All right."
"1364980","1367640"," So let's take a look at a couple of things. "
"1367740","1367960"," Got a idea."
"1368260","1368620"," We in the."
"1369460","1370260"," Oh, yeah. "
"1370580","1371720"," We're in the policy right now."
"1371740","1372640"," I'm going to go inside the."
"1372640","1374580"," I'm inside the discord here. "
"1374640","1375500"," Let me check out the discord."
"1378160","1380000"," I'm going to get inside the general chat."
"1383020","1383700"," Everybody's in here. "
"1383860","1384220"," Yields."
"1384300","1387440"," Yields to the moon was the first person in the discord this morning."
"1390120","1392520"," David AMS is inside the discord this morning. "
"1392800","1395240"," Is he going to trade inside of the pro trader chat?"
"1395540","1396780"," Or is he going to trade the general chat?"
"1397620","1397920"," Oh, dude."
"1398100","1399640"," He's hanging out in the general chat this morning."
"1400240","1401360"," Good morning, Aldi. "
"1401480","1401900"," How are you?"
"1408600","1409420"," Oh, it's adding."
"1409560","1410040"," I got it wrong."
"1410900","1411820"," Hold on a second here. "
"1413540","1414240"," All right."
"1417800","1418300"," Let's see."
"1418340","1418960"," We can do here. "
"1419080","1419720"," Give me a quick second."
"1425380","1426560"," See we can do here."
"1430970","1431450"," Let's see. "
"1431530","1432330"," We got going on here."
"1436890","1438250"," I'm going to check this out here."
"1438450","1439690"," Go from here to here. "
"1443170","1444170"," Oh, I got some good."
"1444310","1444890"," Here's a nice one."
"1447030","1447630"," All right. "
"1447650","1448190"," You guys ready?"
"1450230","1453070"," What are we going to do here?"
"1454130","1454510"," Let's do."
"1455170","1457230"," How do I do this so I don't?"
"1457430","1459330"," I'm going to do this so I don't."
"1459330","1460610"," Let me see what I can do here. "
"1462630","1463250"," All right."
"1465610","1467190"," I hope I got this right."
"1468050","1471190"," I think that's what I think it is. "
"1472290","1472870"," All right."
"1472990","1475410"," The first, I'm going to read it off to you."
"1477510","1478070"," Let's see. "
"1478150","1478750"," You can be fastest."
"1480470","1482370"," I only have five of these."
"1483810","1484970"," I got five of these. "
"1484970","1493090"," This is, I believe, an annual subscription for five people."
"1494810","1496650"," An annual subscription for five people."
"1496870","1499470"," I hope I didn't get this wrong because I wasn't breaking everything. "
"1501890","1503930"," This is a subscriber level."
"1505070","1505870"," Year subscription."
"1507090","1508570"," subscriber level, year subscription. "
"1509490","1515250"," So you want to go sign up for a subscriber subscription and have that code field open for you."
"1515650","1518110"," I only have five though, so it might not work after five times."
"1519050","1519850"," The code is. "
"1522850","1526730"," A as an alpha, nine, one, zero."
"1527390","1528670"," C as in Charlie."
"1528950","1532890"," Oh, he's a capitalized, by the way, capital A nine, one, zero. "
"1532890","1537090"," C, D, two, zero, A, zero."
"1537750","1538470"," See if that works."
"1541210","1542550"," See if that works. "
"1542770","1543870"," See if you can sign up for a year."
"1544410","1548290"," Let me know if you're successful in the comments or if it worked at least or not."
"1551790","1553890"," So there's five year long. "
"1557110","1558490"," I think it's a year subscriber."
"1559390","1564250"," I think that's what it is."
"1565830","1567270"," We'll find out if they work or not. "
"1567350","1568270"," They might watch them not work."
"1568570","1569850"," Again, they'll get screamed at."
"1570430","1571330"," Pitchforks have come out. "
"1576020","1577740"," What else do I have here for you?"
"1578820","1579580"," Is that pro?"
"1579840","1580180"," I don't know."
"1580280","1580640"," Is that pro?"
"1580760","1581420"," I don't know what it is."
"1582720","1583800"," I think it's subscriber. "
"1587620","1588720"," What else do we get here?"
"1589140","1590640"," And I'll have some more for you later."
"1591500","1595120"," I'll get some more codes for you guys later this morning."
"1596980","1600980"," If it works for any of you, just let me know in the chat, be like, it works. "
"1601840","1602380"," I got in."
"1603020","1617200"," Oh, I"
"1617200","1622020"," was just told that the Twitch is no longer honoring the Amazon Prime membership for chat."
"1623540","1631950"," I'm trying to find out here. "
"1632550","1633710"," Someone was asking that question."
"1634630","1636770"," It could be the new bot that we have in the chat."
"1636770","1640870"," One of the problems we have, or not problems, but an issue we're having right now is we've got an"
"1640870","1641270"," issue. "
"1641370","1643870"," We've got some bots running the chat now."
"1644570","1648970"," And I think that was part of the reason to remove VIPs, mods, and reset everybody."
"1650210","1653670"," Plus we didn't have enough slots available for VIPs and mods. "
"1654630","1655850"," So to go back and reset everything."
"1660730","1661670"," My bot is perfect."
"1661930","1662270"," Leave it alone. "
"1665970","1666810"," Did anybody."
"1668390","1669150"," Did anybody."
"1669570","1673250"," Did any of the thing that somebody said they used their prime this morning right on?"
"1673670","1680350"," Did anybody try that code that there was anybody successful trying that code?"
"1681330","1683230"," Here I'll go in the discord in the general chat. "
"1683450","1684510"," See if anybody's joining us."
"1685430","1687050"," Oh, here we go."
"1689170","1690670"," We got people in the discord. "
"1691250","1691970"," Heck yeah."
"1706460","1709040"," Big balls is in the house this morning in discord."
"1709640","1710420"," It's up big balls. "
"1711040","1712680"," I don't know."
"1712760","1713940"," Mobile's here this morning."
"1714400","1716060"," What's going on, baby?"
"1719340","1722560"," David MS checking in that he's long in queue right now in that dip by. "
"1722800","1726620"," If you look down below right now, you can see NVDA has the dip by going on."
"1726980","1729080"," Bull stepping in right now to buy the dip."
"1745340","1746340"," See if they can read some. "
"1746460","1747040"," Hold on a second here."
"1747140","1748320"," We got to turn that off there."
"1749800","1751400"," Turn that off over there. "
"1752920","1754860"," We got a new music too for you guys."
"1755180","1756720"," We got a whole bunch of stuff for you guys."
"1763570","1769050"," We got some people saying that they're subscribers but are not in the discord yet. "
"1773450","1776670"," Let me get some white glove support for you right now."
"1776670","1777530"," Hold on a second here."
"1797160","1800400"," Oh yeah, we got Joe's in the chat helping white glove service. "
"1800400","1802100"," Joe in there with his white gloves on."
"1802700","1803540"," Joe's like there."
"1803720","1804300"," Come on over here. "
"1804780","1805560"," Have we met before?"
"1805780","1806480"," Let's be friends."
"1807420","1808620"," You guys don't know Joe donut."
"1809620","1813940"," He's been an integral part of all of this since day one. "
"1813940","1819420"," So we started this because we were tired of seeing retailers get smoked through."
"1821960","1824200"," Since day one, he's the guy that said do this."
"1824700","1830420"," And then we said we want to make this more permanent. "
"1830960","1832680"," Is there any way to make this more permanent?"
"1832980","1834800"," And sure enough, sample the solution."
"1835840","1836760"," We got Bork in the house."
"1836920","1838220"," We got we got Q here. "
"1838620","1839560"," Who else is here this morning?"
"1845010","1846070"," Oh, John Haggotty."
"1846230","1846510"," Puck it up."
"1846710","1848530"," Puck up the lack of consumer confidence report. "
"1849550","1851170"," You guys buying the dip right now?"
"1853250","1855010"," It's been a while since I've been back here."
"1855830","1856670"," I see you guys."
"1856850","1858850"," So I got a bunch of crazy stories for you guys. "
"1859310","1863510"," It's like I got people on like been to it that just found me for the first time."
"1864470","1865570"," You're like you're a bear."
"1866030","1866950"," I'm like no, I'm not. "
"1867270","1869270"," I'm like I got people on my show."
"1869950","1870350"," Hold on."
"1870550","1872290"," I got to do one quick thing. "
"1874450","1874990"," Hold on."
"1875430","1878710"," I got like I got crazy stories for you."
"1880150","1883810"," I guess we got to do the I guess we got to tell people that were streaming today, right?"
"1886110","1887010"," Hold on here. "
"1887090","1888370"," I guess we should tell people that were streaming."
"1888810","1890290"," Nobody even knows they were streaming."
"1891270","1891990"," Hold on. "
"1892710","1894450"," It's like I got people out like people."
"1894550","1897030"," I just found like that guy's the biggest bear in front of it."
"1897030","1897930"," I'm like, oh, no, I'm not. "
"1898070","1900190"," And then like this guy, this guy that I'm like."
"1900190","1902650"," I got to get back to streaming like three weeks."
"1902650","1903190"," No streaming. "
"1909610","1913900"," We only get that one right there."
"1914120","1915140"," This one over there."
"1919970","1921310"," Post that one right there. "
"1922670","1923550"," Damn, there it goes."
"1923930","1924370"," It's up."
"1924570","1924650"," It's on. "
"1924810","1925830"," It's on into it now."
"1933540","1936240"," Let's get back in the discord and see what's going on."
"1936240","1938760"," Who did Dave just dropping bombs inside the discord right now. "
"1940020","1943340"," Joe Nattolo is in the house discord right now."
"1958440","1962600"," Look at that dip by right now on Q is here."
"1984300","1992440"," I'm going to go through the benefits of becoming a subscriber, what you have available to you. "
"1993220","1995080"," So let's go over some of that right now."
"2007590","2011550"," So if you look at, there are a quick second here in me."
"2014010","2015230"," Let's take a look here. "
"2016650","2021150"," So on the supporter level, if you're going to be a supporter, it's 30 bucks a month if you sign"
"2021150","2021670"," up for the year."
"2021770","2025530"," I think it's 300 for the year, 380, something like that, 360."
"2026010","2028030"," You can get one month free or something like that. "
"2028870","2035290"," What you get for that is you're going to get market updates written from me every morning and night"
"2035290","2038030"," if needed, a post."
"2038470","2040270"," You'll get one if needed."
"2040510","2043690"," So if nothing changed or something like that, you may not get a market update. "
"2044270","2050290"," But you'll get one written by me on spy and cues every morning and night if required."
"2052190","2054790"," That is posted on the website under market updates."
"2056610","2062170"," If something changes, let's say I say, yeah, this is what the expectations are for up and down and"
"2062170","2065610"," it goes kind of wild or something goes to the moon and I'm like, oh, we're going to crash. "
"2066090","2069090"," You'll see me update that day or evening after the close."
"2070370","2075550"," The next thing that you get is you get trigger charts on the website."
"2076310","2079429"," And I think that's nine or 12 trigger charts. "
"2080050","2089449"," So if you want access to the triggers and the velocity, there's a page with links to a manipulative"
"2089449","2094929"," chart that you can manipulate with the triggers on them for a bunch of tickers."
"2095250","2099970"," Those are updated twice a day in the morning and at the end of the day, I think before the"
"2099970","2100210"," close."
"2101530","2105950"," So if you want access to triggers and I'm not available for you. "
"2105950","2108130"," It's middle of the night and you're like, I don't even know where anything is."
"2108870","2110970"," You're going to be able to have access to that."
"2112110","2117270"," The next thing you're going to get is access to the AI scanner for our T3 scanner. "
"2118450","2121190"," So we have a spec growth scanner."
"2121550","2128290"," When those spit out a ticker for you, you can check those against the triggers if you'd like."
"2128290","2133570"," There's an expanded scanner for the pro trader, but you get that. "
"2133970","2137690"," The next thing that you get is access to our basic discord."
"2138690","2140870"," So you have basic discord and we have a pro discord."
"2142090","2144410"," Basic discord, you're going to get access. "
"2144890","2145670"," Ready for this is crazy."
"2147250","2148850"," You're going to get premium bots."
"2149410","2153930"," I think right now we have the BB bot in there and then we have some other bot, but we"
"2153930","2155270"," pay for premium bots. "
"2156170","2158130"," From traditicks, unusual whales."
"2159610","2163730"," I think we're looking at a couple of those or we're looking at a gamma bot, but I think unusual"
"2163730","2165230"," whales does it pretty well, I think."
"2166230","2169350"," So you have premium bots, just not alone should have you signing up. "
"2170690","2173270"," You also get access to Twitch for chat."
"2174710","2177330"," You also get a daily pivot indicator."
"2177970","2180590"," So I know I told you that you get free pivots every morning. "
"2181050","2182350"," You're also going to get an indicator."
"2182890","2184650"," So that's this thing right here."
"2185130","2187370"," See these lines and these numbers right here?"
"2188970","2191110"," So you get access to that indicator. "
"2191490","2192530"," That indicator is pretty cool."
"2192650","2193730"," You can set that indicator."
"2194510","2200350"," I have a training video that's getting released today about it, but you can set it to traditional"
"2200350","2202130"," pivots, Fibonacci pivots. "
"2202530","2206150"," You can move the numbers to the right a little bit if you want."
"2206330","2207590"," You can change a bunch of shit on it."
"2208270","2210030"," So you get that indicator as well. "
"2211050","2217550"," The next thing that's launching today is we have an educational video series, like a basic"
"2217550","2217870"," training."
"2218630","2220270"," I think it's like 20 or 30 videos."
"2220270","2222290"," Binky is posting those today on the website. "
"2223210","2229270"," So it'll give you a step-by-step process into how to use the triggers and a step-by-step"
"2229270","2231430"," process in how to use the pivot indicator."
"2233230","2237230"," So that's everything that you get for the pro-trader level."
"2238610","2244750"," You're going to get access to premium discord and you get direct access to the trigger team. "
"2245410","2248770"," So we have professional traders in there where I shouldn't say that."
"2249030","2255810"," We have traders in there that are there to help you throughout your entire day."
"2256090","2261510"," So if you're a pro-trader and you want the quietness of a professional environment, that will be"
"2261510","2262530"," available to you. "
"2263590","2265630"," You get the T3 indicator suite."
"2266250","2272430"," So you actually get to get the trigger system and you get to just walk away with it."
"2272530","2273950"," Do your own thing on trading view. "
"2275730","2280530"," You also get not only the market updates every morning, but you're going to get pro updates."
"2281710","2285090"," So you get like expanded posts from myself."
"2286010","2291350"," That's going to include forecast charts, SPX gamma for S&P 500. "
"2292050","2295390"," You're going to get Elliott wave charts from me on an hourly basis."
"2295790","2298790"," You're also going to get Elliott wave charts from me on a daily basis."
"2299630","2306090"," For I think SPY, Q's, Tesla and VDA and oil or at least XOM. "
"2307350","2311670"," That's throughout the entire week and then a Sunday special and all that kind of stuff in written"
"2311670","2312090"," briefs."
"2314590","2317750"," You also get access to the T3 bull bear alert bot."
"2319510","2324190"," And then you get all the other stuff that I talked about from the subscriber level. "
"2325090","2328630"," So depending upon what you want here, there should be something for everybody."
"2330330","2333070"," I think the premium bots alone are worth the price."
"2333250","2334470"," I think those are gangster. "
"2334590","2338410"," They're not cheap, so I think that's a deal all on its own."
"2347670","2348890"," Hey, good morning, Evan."
"2349050","2349370"," How you doing?"
"2349390","2349810"," Evan Harrington. "
"2350550","2351530"," It's going to be back, man."
"2351930","2352410"," Good to be back."
"2356460","2358560"," If you're not up right there, of course, you can see it. "
"2365480","2367500"," HYG, a little lagging this morning."
"2368040","2369480"," Vicks, though, dropping off slightly."
"2371620","2372840"," Looking for a dip by this morning. "
"2373020","2375340"," Let's take a look at Tesla at some point and see where it's at."
"2376120","2378700"," T and X kind of just chilling over here, rolling over slightly."
"2380920","2382480"," NDX bleeding a little bit here. "
"2383060","2384260"," Dip by her stepping in."
"2386180","2388820"," They failed here to get a new high on that rip."
"2391200","2392620"," Not a good sign for bulls. "
"2394460","2396940"," Looks like they got a nice little pump, but not a new high."
"2397260","2399580"," So we'll watch this and see what happens with NDX if this fails."
"2408940","2411460"," I'm going to read to you some of the news this morning as well. "
"2437810","2439670"," NDX with a failure on a new high."
"2439810","2440810"," That's never good to see."
"2441070","2448030"," Even so, though, if you're bullish here, this is still the place to buy a dip. "
"2448330","2453770"," Even if you're a bull, you buy the dip and put a stop underneath the blast through you and trigger"
"2453770","2454350"," that stop."
"2454690","2457550"," But wait for it to come back up to seal the deal to the downside."
"2458110","2458910"," If you guys know what that means. "
"2472480","2478720"," Our levels for ES and Q available on the website, so we had to get a second data plan."
"2479080","2481580"," So all you guys know, it's like the solar levels."
"2481580","2482880"," I had to pay for that data. "
"2483360","2484920"," The free levels that are on the website."
"2485440","2486640"," We have to pay for that."
"2487480","2496600"," And we forgot that the data package is separate for futures and Bitcoin. "
"2497760","2500220"," So that data package was either bought."
"2500360","2503260"," I think it was bought last night in the middle of the night at like one in the morning or"
"2503260","2503940"," something like that."
"2503940","2510860"," They're working on getting you those levels for futures should be on today at some point if it's"
"2510860","2512060"," not already on right now. "
"2528000","2529160"," To pay for it."
"2529220","2530360"," Make the second daughter do it."
"2538000","2539140"," I read that. "
"2548420","2549040"," I read that."
"2549040","2550760"," Or are you guys able to sign up?"
"2551060","2552040"," Let me know in the chat again."
"2552140","2552980"," Maybe you already did. "
"2553180","2554120"," Say something in chat."
"2554360","2555040"," Say the code works."
"2556020","2557920"," I'm in somebody out there. "
"2558040","2558700"," Tell me they got in."
"2559900","2560600"," Hey, Andre."
"2562300","2563020"," You're awesome too. "
"2566540","2568240"," Did you get in using the code?"
"2568240","2570500"," Did anybody get in using the code?"
"2572200","2573500"," I don't want to make sure we're not great."
"2575040","2578080"," We're like, okay, we'll turn it on quietly and see if anyone signs up."
"2578180","2578860"," We don't break anything. "
"2580980","2585300"," Okay, so the code was only good for five people, I think."
"2585620","2586820"," So someone said they got in."
"2588300","2589920"," Someone said they got in though, right?"
"2591240","2593900"," Okay, so somebody did get in. "
"2594540","2597060"," It looks like some people got in."
"2597740","2598960"," Someone's saying that it did work."
"2600600","2602080"," I got more coming for you guys. "
"2602200","2603700"," We're not done with the codes here."
"2608140","2609020"," Could not be helped."
"2609240","2609980"," Thanks for signing up. "
"2613460","2615560"," All right, so that code is now dead."
"2615900","2616640"," So don't try it anymore."
"2617400","2618840"," The code is dead now. "
"2621720","2623100"," Where is the code, please?"
"2624940","2626740"," Ireland just said, where is the code?"
"2630940","2631880"," There is a."
"2638140","2639800"," There are more codes."
"2641020","2641860"," How about this?"
"2642740","2643980"," I got one for you, okay?"
"2644640","2645540"," You guys want the next one?"
"2646300","2647340"," I got the next one for you."
"2648340","2650120"," Should I do the next one right now or not?"
"2652920","2654240"," You guys want the next one?"
"2655020","2656180"," You guys want the next free code?"
"2659440","2660900"," Beat pick code, please. "
"2663520","2664940"," All right, next code."
"2667140","2668680"," Oh, Joe says no weight."
"2670380","2672460"," Joe knows that I'm going to be like, I need more codes. "
"2672720","2673260"," I need more freeze."
"2680600","2681160"," Too funny."
"2690560","2691440"," All right, here we go. "
"2691560","2692080"," Let's go here."
"2692180","2692820"," Hold on one second here."
"2697390","2698550"," Oh, let's take it here. "
"2701250","2702330"," What do I got going on there?"
"2702550","2703290"," I got them in the wrong place."
"2705610","2707130"," Am I in the wrong place?"
"2714260","2714980"," Hold on here."
"2719520","2720600"," I got a good in there. "
"2720880","2721680"," I got to check this out."
"2724900","2729000"," Hold on one second here."
"2767990","2769230"," What do we got going on here?"
"2782330","2783110"," I'll say this. "
"2784550","2785990"," I had a code."
"2786730","2788370"," There's a code that I had."
"2789450","2790550"," If you can find it. "
"2791310","2795090"," There's a whole bunch of free memberships."
"2795710","2796310"," It's hidden."
"2796490","2797210"," You just got to find it. "
"2797550","2801150"," If you can find it on your own, you'll get in."
"2809280","2810260"," What do we got there?"
"2838430","2839650"," Yeah, there's a challenge."
"2842750","2845430"," The add the code during the checkout process. "
"2845430","2850330"," There should be a little line to add the code for the free memberships."
"2853370","2853890"," That's right."
"2854390","2855990"," It's all national treasure now. "
"2856630","2857490"," You got to find them."
"2857610","2858330"," You have to find them."
"2865400","2866740"," Let me take a look at. "
"2867000","2868380"," Give me one quick second here."
"2868440","2869580"," Let me read you guys something here."
"2869740","2870180"," Oh, nope. "
"2870320","2870960"," I went the wrong way."
"2871280","2871820"," Wrong way."
"2874220","2876100"," I'm going to get back in the discord here. "
"2881580","2882840"," Hold on one second here."
"2888780","2890640"," I'm going to read something to you this morning."
"2900640","2901660"," What do we have here?"
"2905130","2908070"," The higher for longer narrative stays intact. "
"2908070","2914950"," Despite relatively poor data and a 19.4% drop in non-defense capital goods orders, traders are now"
"2914950","2918290"," looking forward to consumer confidence in a seven-year note auction."
"2919010","2924050"," Consumer confidence is a CD consumer confidence is at 10 a.m. That already happened."
"2924270","2930370"," And then we got the seven-year note at 1 p.m. Gamma is the same. "
"2931030","2934830"," 5100 is the most prominent long gamma strike and likely will limit any upside."
"2934830","2937350"," Well, the downside support is rather limited."
"2938230","2939630"," We saw that this morning, right?"
"2939750","2944930"," We're talking about if the buyers can't hold where we are right now, that we will likely go down"
"2944930","2948390"," and close that gap to the downside in SPX. "
"2948630","2950890"," So the buyers are still here right now trying to buy that dip."
"2953670","2957770"," We know that there is no real floor underneath, right?"
"2957970","2959370"," Then we'll close that gap to the downside."
"2959850","2961290"," So I've got that for you so far. "
"2963610","2965870"," What else we got going on here this morning?"
"2967770","2974750"," I noticed that analysts this morning are also calling for $5.30 for $5,300 in SPX barclays this"
"2974750","2980970"," morning raising the S&P 500 target to $5,300 on tech leadership and resilient economy."
"2982970","2985390"," There are some Elliott waivers out there."
"2985690","2986370"," I'll tell you this. "
"2986370","2990950"," There are some Elliott waivers out there that have us going way higher."
"2991710","2993930"," Way, way higher this year."
"2996090","2996730"," 5300?"
"2997410","3001670"," How about 6,000 as a possibility into March?"
"3001810","3002570"," I know that sounds crazy. "
"3004090","3004550"," Possible."
"3006690","3013790"," Now, I think last week was JPM, I think last week, before I raised their estimates to $5.20, right?"
"3014590","3015290"," Or $5,200."
"3016310","3019530"," You might find them raising those estimates into next year. "
"3020430","3023830"," I posted on Twitter a PE ratio."
"3024830","3028990"," You want to click on that PE ratio chart that I posted."
"3030450","3038950"," And we're about to eclipse both the run in the 80s to 87 and then an early 90s run. "
"3038950","3047950"," And we're now looking at a run from 1995 to 1999, which was an insane bull market."
"3049850","3057010"," You want to see 6,000, you'd want to see a successful back test of 5,000."
"3058270","3063990"," I also shared a chart on the website on the JPM caller. "
"3066210","3073650"," And that defense of that 5,000 level is going to be a big deal for bulls holding 5,000."
"3074530","3076570"," Everything seems to suggest that as well."
"3077230","3084330"," So for that thesis to hold true, if we back test and hold that 5,000 in any way shape"
"3084330","3091190"," or form, even if we correct and come back to that 5,000 and hold that, we are or we"
"3091190","3092510"," want to entertain the conversation. "

"13447780","13456780"," actually work this is real and it makes sense I understand the logic they are timing business"
"13456780","13464860"," cycles applying their tools at certain inflection points of the business cycle right we're saying"
"13464860","13473360"," hey inflation is running high hey it's been seven years in this cycle or ten years in this cycle so"
"13473360","13480360"," they apply their tools are they really make an impact or not have it's hard to prove do they happen"
"13480360","13486920"," to coincide with these things not normal business cycles happen possibly does that make sense so I"
"13486920","13494260"," start a business I don't know let's say I start a restaurant right I think it's 97 I think it's"

"13501660","13508400"," then the last 30% they don't last too much longer like five to seven percent 20-year restaurant is"
"13508400","13514280"," like three percent of restaurants right but you have a normal cycle is my point behind businesses"
"13514280","13521200"," and so you have an average that comes out in businesses in the US these fed people apply their"
"13521200","13528040"," tools and my point here being that if Cohen happens to coincide or not doesn't really matter they"
"13528040","13536020"," don't have to actually stop or cut rates they have no reason to there's nothing in public saying"
"13536020","13545300"," that they should cut rates so do I see a rate cut right now no and to that point we've"
"13545300","13552660"," had some hot prints come out here recently right on short of time frames and inflation you we still"

"13612060","13616740"," this place I was like you got to be fucking kidding me and it was a mad house in there"

"13623120","13627920"," you know the unemployment rate is wrong people are just working two or three jobs that might be the"
"13627920","13634140"," case that might be the case people are working two three jobs you might be having a hard time out"

"13646120","13653420"," doing that right now and that is the key difference here is that you have a job you were able"
"13653420","13662500"," to get more work and continue to make these wheels turn the cogs turn so I don't see why the"
"13662500","13669640"," fed would cut rates right now I don't think that they need to we really need to see blood in"
"13669640","13675400"," the streets in the economy in out in public you want to see like you're not joking here you want"

"13698460","13704240"," see when you start to see stuff like that something's probably broken you see a bank popping on"
"13704240","13711400"," CNBC if you see like a JP Morgan out there asking for donations one day that's a that's an issue"
"13711400","13718660"," you know what I mean you want to see things in your real life that are concerning no not the"
"13718660","13723840"," threat of war with Russia not the threat of this or credit card debts as high as it's ever been"
"13723840","13733560"," these mortgage guys were pre-pack or repackaging bad debt into into high rate loans this was this"
"13733560","13738020"," past about three months ago no they couldn't write loan they weren't writing mortgages they're out"
"13738020","13742960"," there rewriting bad debt for people uh they're giving them rate like still like you got a credit"

"13748220","13752620"," that so they repackage it into that so these people are still paying them it's my point they've"
"13752620","13757480"," been giving extensions on the debt they've taken the bad debt that they've taken and so it's not"
"13757480","13762740"," that process won't continue just that we're not there yet as the point and that's the best"
"13762740","13768820"," repulpiration why would the Fed cut rates today we have not achieved two percent year over year"
"13768820","13775240"," inflation have we Jimmy can you ask can you answer in the chat have we achieved two percent year"
"13775240","13781700"," over year inflation i'm going to say no did i miss something because i don't think that we have for"

"13788120","13794300"," if the Fed was going to cut rates now right they have already proven that they are a new Fed"
"13794300","13802400"," to some extent there were two key things that shocked me the first one was when they said that they"
"13802400","13810900"," would that they would be honest before they make decisions they would telegraph i think the exact"
"13810900","13816500"," verbiage was they will telegraph before we ever get to a rate decision what will happen or change"
"13816500","13823840"," language over time before that happens but and they have done that they've been pretty honest"
"13824400","13830260"," there's been no surprise i got your moment so far from the start even right now i haven't seen"
"13830260","13835940"," anything it's been crazy you know surprise we got you we just burned everybody down at the ground"
"13836480","13840760"," told you weren't going to raise rates we did and that kind of stuff so i don't see why the"
"13840760","13850240"," Fed has a reason if you have a if it in my viewpoint the Fed wants inflation"
"13850240","13858240"," to bounce around just nice and gentle sideways like ride that two percent just above it maybe slip"
"13858240","13862980"," below two percent and ride down below they want to see that jobs those jobs numbers those"
"13862980","13871200"," unemployment numbers steady like the less volatility in uh in direction of those things uh though"
"13871200","13877800"," the the market goes off and does what it wants to do you know people out there talk about are"

"13888100","13892880"," soft landing we were promised they've already when they were telling you we could have a soft"
"13892880","13899380"," landing that time period's already taking place right now um does that make sense i don't know if"
"13899380","13904060"," it doesn't but anyways we have no velocity and inflation no velocity and unemployment get no slam"
"13904060","13909100"," down and slam up you know that stuff i don't see why we if you guys think right now that"
"13909100","13914700"," we're getting rate cuts tell me why in the chat i want to hear your thesis here i've heard a"
"13914700","13923840"," bunch of thesis's as to why they should cut to me that thesis that is pushed in public"
"13923840","13933240"," like we just listened to on CNBC all of those thesis's not just rates but those thesis's are geared"
"13933240","13942600"," more towards gambling in the stock market right then it has to do with reality so think about that"
"13942600","13950880"," when you're pushed a story is this real or am i long i-w-m right is my old man"

"14159740","14165240"," side of this if you watch how the numbers come out then they get revised you can see that they're"
"14165240","14172100"," they're massaging the numbers we have accounts and books uh well people that work for the fed that"
"14172100","14178580"," say hey look i've got a phd in in this statistical modeling and i worked for the fed for five"

"14322800","14333840"," want to show you guys this really quick what my point is behind this so"
"14333840","14342920"," this right here is uh bill this is the PE ratio uh for s&p 500 you can look at"
"14342920","14348940"," this on pro trader do it yourself whatever you want to do but one of the key points here is"
"14349500","14357180"," the PE ratio is this white line right here you see that white line that horizontal line you see"
"14357180","14363800"," this white line right here that's where we are currently in the PE ratio what we're doing is we're"
"14363800","14372220"," eclipsing uh two time periods right now this is the 1987 crash we're already above it and we're"
"14372220","14381740"," about to eclipse the 1989 until 1995 uh peak as well in PE ratio so here and here"
"14381740","14389880"," see that right there then what is that what is that setup for us it's taught and now we got"
"14389880","14397560"," a nice pullback right here right and then a push higher and this is between the 1995 and the year"
"14397560","14407480"," 2000 so let's take a closer look at this just so you can see"
"14407480","14412560"," it here then i want you to see this here we got a little pullback right here come back up"
"14412560","14420200"," here retest down below right and this huge leg up this is into uh 1999"
"14420200","14427540"," right here pull back down and this is where we had the big crash above here so my other point"
"14427540","14435520"," here is you can see current prices right here whoop how do we get that push up to 52530 correction"
"14435520","14442200"," and then a giant move up and end of the year right there just keep your eyes on that i"
"14442200","14452100"," don't see seeing all this stuff i seeing all this stuff i i'm not sure that um whereas bearish is"
"14452100","14458180"," some may think we can be this could be a top but looking at these PE ratios they've been doing"
"14458180","14463380"," this shit these guys have been doing this shit since 1978 like in the 50s and 60s but a great"
"14463380","14472720"," tax code and then they started to change the tax code to favor people with wealth by 1978 into 1980"
"14472720","14479560"," when Regan was uh our president right there was this whole transformation uh you can see it"

"16480840","16485820"," best school districts they're going to run to the best school districts because the houses housing"

"16625640","16631119"," not requiring them already to do it's kind of a headscotching over all this you know it's really"
"16631119","16637580"," funny to me i just went yesterday i had like a day from hell driving hours to go to a"
"16637580","16647580"," uh fbla state fbla meeting so it's uh the future business leaders of america for those of you"

"16659960","16666400"," it um but the uh the fbla is is basically you know these kids do tests and and compete in"
"16666400","16670520"," you know one of the biggest ones was business math you know so they're going in there and showing"
"16670520","16676939"," that they can take the balance sheet of a company and show you it's uh you know it's profit and"

"16778040","16783700"," ones on my target list and it's and it's the public school is there but man it's different and i"
"16783700","16789020"," mean they're the types of things they test on now you know how to build how to how to market"

"20466250","20474910"," our website not from twitch not from youtube do you know why it's not because uh it's not because"
"20474910","20481550"," we like it's not because we want to do our own thing it's because we watch uh we've watched how"

"20495430","20501330"," taking their fees well whoever twitter's taking their fees once you're into their their into their"
"20501330","20508830"," garden you can't escape it and then eventually eventually that should turn into where you can't"
"20509410","20515930"," even jump in and be a part of that growth of that garden so reddit is very similar to that"

"20539790","20546990"," working knowing that in the future they'll likely be closed doors like twitter will close its door"
"20547670","20553390"," youtube will close its door uh twitch will close its door and where do we go what do we do"
"20553390","20560470"," then if we're not in their garden so i think we have to pre-plan for that uh possible eventuality"
"20560470","20566550"," you know in five ten years or whatever does that make any sense i don't know if i'm making any"
"20566550","20576410"," sense saying that but that was our meeting this past week my looking for investors uh no uh i'll be"

"20631390","20637430"," of that shit uh never done any of that stuff i could have monetized this years ago and didn't all"
"20637430","20641090"," right i could have gotten a lot of followers too by doing fucked up shit never did any of that"

"20697340","20704540"," a this sounds crazy but i would love to um i i don't that happens but either become a brokerage"

"20710080","20715580"," assholes what they did to retailers but uh that's a pipe dream that's like way over there that's"

"20721220","20725960"," we were able to launch a better product than robin hood that'd be fun i know that sounds crazy but"
"20725960","20730580"," you got to look at it and say i was a possible to do that for retailers uh that would"
"20730580","20736660"," be that'd be fun to do it'd be nice to like do that not and not take a cut off"

"20747700","20762090"," but we have to figure it out it's plausible yeah i"

"22514160","22522400"," can't guarantee it i'll tell you one thing if you're long uh you cut your lungs below this half"
"22522400","22527200"," hour an hour trigger down here otherwise uh maybe you think they're going to pin it but i think we"
"22527200","22533400"," squeeze up and i think we're going up you want to know i think we're bullish this week again let's"
"22533400","22539420"," prove it otherwise even if we close that gap down below still bullish this week even if we roll"
"22539420","22552960"," down and close it still bullish i'm bullish here you want to know still bullish"
"22552960","22559700"," on this week i'd like i think i'd need to see like the gap closed down below i need to"
"22559700","22564640"," see the gap closed down below and then some kind of rejection off the hourly trigger then i would"
"22564640","22570660"," start to get bearish but other than that i'm bullish on the week i want to i want to see"
"22570660","22588810"," i want to let me show it to you today i go to spx here uh"
"22588810","22598010"," bottom right screen so right here okay okay ah shit look at between things all right let me turn"
"22598010","22606130"," this off right there and there's your target right there right you've got your gap closer down"
"22606130","22615390"," below here let's show you this so here's your gap closer right down here right oh you can kind of"
"22615390","22625330"," see that alone show it right there so you got your people that want to close your gap right we're"
"22625330","22630830"," probably if we're going to close the gap we'll up likely thursday right so we're going to close the"
"22630830","22637110"," gap down here some shit like that i'm looking for it on thursday not pouring no news anything like"
"22637110","22643770"," that okay now you've got buyers pushing up down below here we know there's demand we know there"
"22643770","22649110"," needs to be a reason for that demand to go away right but we also have we also have a"
"22649110","22658630"," ceiling right now above and that ceiling is at 5100 okay so watch right here hold on so"
"22658630","22668770"," you get a ceiling right now you get sellers trying to sell you down right they're right up here you"
"22668770","22674530"," can have known demand right here and we likely on thursday have some volatility they can send us"
"22674530","22683090"," lower right so you should be a dip buyer down here right you've got your first dip by right here"
"22683090","22689510"," now as we slam up in here they'll sell it back down we'll keep buying it and then eventually we're"
"22689510","22695130"," going to get some volatile news likely thursday where we hit this bottom and close this gap down"
"22695130","22701350"," below now if you want to get super bullish right you want to get super bullish you'd need to see"
"22701350","22709850"," price get above 5100 consolidates and beat this previous high right here to go and attack 5200 to"
"22709850","22716970"," the upside so none of this has happened yet right and this bull this becomes bullish if we get the"
"22716970","22723550"," new high back here right whatever pullback that is something like that then this becomes bullish"
"22723550","22731190"," structure so until then right you're just buying the dips to smash into this resistance above at"
"22731190","22737130"," 5100 and you're likely going to get some volatile news into thursday that draws us back down to"
"22737130","22744970"," close this dip likely not guaranteed but likely but even so even saying that right even saying all"
"22744970","22752230"," of that i'm still bullish there so if we close this gap down below i'm still looking for a dip"
"22752230","22758550"," buy to go even higher again okay so if you have a chance at any point this week if this"
"22758550","22766030"," gap gets closed i'm a buyer there does it make sense uh for that target of 5.25 to the"
"22766030","22773970"," upside so what i would need to see to get bearish like truly bearish would be the bloodbath down"
"22775390","22783030"," right you get the bloodbath down you come back up here and the hourly trigger rains down and begins"
"22783030","22790350"," to sell you down if i see anything like that right there on this gap closure then i'm going to"
"22790350","22795910"," start getting bearish we're going to be like oh shit here we go blast down new low boom boom boom"
"22795910","22801890"," and start closing a bunch more stuff down below doesn't make sense so i need we need this to happen"
"22801890","22808930"," for extended bearishness need that need that rejection on the hourly trigger or we need to get"
"22808930","22817610"," above here for the extension of 5.25 excuse me so until then this is just consolidation buy the"
"22817610","22823510"," dips sell the rips up here buy the dips sell the rip this is the finger trap right in here"
"22823510","22827610"," and then if we can buy a dip down there we do if we can get above we buy above"
"22827610","22851960"," and get really pulled up above there does that answer any questions for any of you yeah"
"22855580","22861720"," i don't see any selling into the clothes i see squeezed into the clothes i do it's right here well"
"22861720","22866860"," we squeeze up we probably got to continue into the after hours too i'm not seeing it right now so"
"22866860","22872120"," so i do i would expect i will say this though if we go up in the overnight i would"
"22872120","22877640"," expect to sell in the open oh they'll say that to you as well so if we squeeze up the"
"22877640","22883980"," 5100 on spx into the overnight then we were likely going to sell that on the opening bell tomorrow"
"22888270","22897550"," that's right down here so if you see futures blast up here whoop right there i would expect sellers"
"22897550","22907530"," to come in on the opening bell tomorrow hey last fun zone how's it"
"22907530","22917980"," going yeah"

"22932060","22937600"," that we're like free to do whatever we want what do they call it the window of weakness right it"
"22937600","22941480"," doesn't mean we're going to be weak this means there's a window there so that's not really in play"
"22941480","22951450"," right now we have a pin on 5100 for opx right now tell chase just tell"
"22951450","22967140"," chase tell them explain another we have a pin on the market the 5100 we"

"22993210","22997910"," every time we slam into it we'll sell but we'll come right back to it again i'm going to simplify"

"23002630","23010170"," back down market will be supportive any any any kind of uh like any kind of like gap closing down"
