"21900","22500"," Morning."
"22600","23320"," How are you?"
"46300","47320"," Good morning out there."
"47420","47740"," How y'all doing?"
"47740","48540"," Just getting set up here. "
"48740","49220"," Couple seconds."
"90200","99140"," All right, good morning."
"101660","103040"," Got a couple quick things to do here. "
"110780","114320"," And then I got a couple quick things go right into here."
"115880","116780"," Good morning, everybody."
"117260","118520"," How y'all doing this morning?"
"120140","124320"," We have got one quick thing to do here. "
"131420","133300"," And we'll look at this this morning."
"134020","136320"," It's a good night so far to hold overnight."
"137780","146000"," Though I saw some people noticing there was there was a gunshot in the market this morning. "
"146000","147380"," You can see it right there in the chart."
"148600","154470"," And that was a reaction from the daily."
"157930","161500"," From the daily gun, right?"
"161820","163360"," I am like a shot this morning. "
"165300","170380"," And we're going to take a look at it."
"172460","176200"," And we're going to staff some lines here so you can see it."
"176280","177540"," First off, just starting out this morning. "
"178500","179620"," Just so you can see."
"180580","182080"," We've got a pre-market high here."
"182260","184740"," We've got the clothes over here and down below here. "
"184800","185660"," We've got the pre-market low."
"186420","187480"," Sometimes we're at the bell."
"189080","190800"," I've got some I got a bunch of puts out here. "
"190920","193660"," So I got to deal with those here in the next couple minutes."
"193660","194760"," Don't eat minutes or so."
"194760","196840"," You're not going to have me with you here for the second of the bell. "
"197400","201800"," Sometimes I'll come back down and test this pre-market low."
"203260","205400"," If we green bar it up, we'll come back down here."
"205660","208920"," Now we'll take a look at where I expect us to go off the bell briefly. "
"209420","213940"," We'll look at it just so that you have some idea where I think we're going to go off the"
"213940","214120"," bell."
"215300","218540"," I am not one that is known for."
"218840","225920"," So let's say I'm holding calls right here, right?"
"226380","229460"," And I even expect we're going to go up here holding calls. "
"230100","235620"," I will still take the money and run and look for an entry for that rip higher."
"236400","238980"," I never lose some."
"239520","244100"," But you know, for me, money made, like every single day, I'm going to take a look at it. "
"244100","251440"," So every time I hold overnight on a 0-8, up or down, the longer I hold, the more risk"
"251440","252100"," I take on."
"252380","253880"," It's a directional trade, right?"
"255660","263700"," Let's not say I win 70% of these, just by holding them, hoping myself up to new risk, like"
"263700","265560"," rolling the dice the second, third time."
"265840","267120"," We're gonna talk about that today. "
"267220","272640"," We're gonna talk about the 0-8 gamblers and who they are and are they us, which I don't think"
"272640","275100"," that they are, but we'll talk about it."
"275520","281900"," And maybe some of you might be because I do see some people on social media that remind me of"
"281900","282260"," gamblers."
"282820","289020"," And we'll talk about what to look for, how to identify that this morning as well as it being a"
"289020","289240"," Friday. "
"291140","292620"," We'll review this kind of stuff."
"293460","298040"," And as a matter of fact, I was talking to a buddy and some of you guys out there know"
"298040","300020"," how I make most of my money in the market."
"300840","304820"," And then what I do to day trade, what my day trading rules are. "
"307140","308580"," Some of you don't, but some of you do."
"309160","312020"," Now, we'll go over that this morning, if you have a moment."
"312660","314640"," And we'll take a look at something here. "
"314800","321100"," I'm gonna close some stuff up and just give you a a brief look here, okay?"
"321900","322780"," As we open."
"325300","333280"," Now, as we open here, we've got kind of close here, right?"
"334340","336300"," We've got the pre-market low below."
"336840","342160"," I believe that at a pre-market low here. "
"343400","344500"," We'll get rid of this one."
"346860","348320"," And we have a pre-market high."
"349160","350160"," Let's see if I can look at this. "
"353730","369510"," 408.32. 405.01. So that's 405, not 43, but 405.01. The"
"369510","373990"," charts from Trading View don't do the best job."
"375710","378990"," I don't know, maybe some of the data I'm not paying for or something."
"379930","381470"," And then we've got 408.01 up here. "
"382650","383470"," We have that right there."
"384210","384910"," Just check that again."
"386810","395590"," 408.32. So we've got way up here. "
"404750","406790"," Now, what do I think happens off this bell?"
"407010","408230"," We've got four minutes left."
"409470","410630"," I think we squeeze higher."
"411810","413410"," Off the bell, I think we squeeze higher. "
"413690","415570"," I'd like to see a squeeze higher off the bell."
"416490","420830"," Come back down, catch this, and then make that run in failure on 410."
"421530","423990"," We could just start running right off the bell as well. "
"423990","424810"," We'll find out."
"425730","429270"," I think Jenny Marcus said something and double cap crimping or something."
"429670","431510"," People are noticing this off the bell. "
"432590","436530"," And now that the funny part is now that Marco has said something and prior to that some other"
"436530","439190"," people had said some stuff, cats out of the bag now, right?"
"439710","443570"," You know that your intent is to say don't, it's just like Mike Barrie, right?"
"443750","445210"," He shouldn't come out public and say sell."
"445910","447570"," He just kept his mouth shut."
"448070","450430"," Probably sold, but now you've got the cat out of the bag. "
"450990","453170"," We've got zero to call buyers in the market."
"453170","456350"," And so now you're going to have everybody out there trying to buy fucking zero dates."
"456990","457710"," So whatever. "
"458110","464750"," If I was going to be scared of that because you're going to get an unintended consequence of, hold"
"464750","484040"," on a second, I had"
"484040","488380"," to get ready for a, I don't get, I don't get fucked over over here."
"489520","494920"," Ain't to blab my mouth off and end up getting torched."
"498570","501130"," So if I had to guess here, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to. "
"501190","502590"," So right here, just coming in the bell right here."
"502650","503930"," See the one minute here."
"506310","507030"," 406 36. "
"508730","509090"," So."
"512409","513130"," 406 36."
"518390","519370"," Right off the bell. "
"527190","528210"," The two minutes left."
"528530","529870"," We can stay above this right here."
"533740","536400"," We should, we should run higher off the bell. "
"540240","542180"," We'll see watching these two right here."
"542960","545180"," I'm going to snap some lines in for you this morning."
"545340","546280"," Your levels for you. "
"547540","551790"," I'm going to fucking limit sell this shit."
"553150","555950"," Um, get a minute 21 left."
"557290","560870"," What I'll do is I'm going to snap your lines for you this morning right now. "
"568110","569530"," You've got President's Day over the weekend."
"569710","572610"," Normally I'm skiing this weekend and I'm not working on websites."
"573110","574110"," So I got nothing going on. "
"574150","575730"," If you guys have vacation this weekend, congratulations."
"576590","576970"," You're going to go skiing."
"577090","578870"," As a matter of fact, snowing here too, and I'm not going skiing. "
"580450","583510"," At 10 a.m. we've got a index of leading economic indicators."
"584290","585250"," That's the only of all that I can see."
"585330","586830"," There's probably some speakers at some point. "
"587810","588590"," 50 seconds left."
"592180","595940"," And I'll start posting some, some of my levels for you here."
"597060","598840"," Point is four nine 78. "
"612330","613610"," And I'll panic you here."
"613750","616190"," I'm like, get done, get done, get done, get done before the bell."
"618470","619210"," There's your pivot. "
"634940","635880"," Just a second here."
"638620","639460"," This shit did."
"642480","643740"," I told 172. "
"645600","646480"," Not that good."
"650960","651620"," Fucking puts."
"651900","652260"," Don't pay. "
"656410","658890"," I got made more money on the top of that."
"658970","660610"," We're trading below the five in it right now."
"661530","662390"," I'm going to post it. "
"662490","665370"," We've got the gap to close down below here."
"665610","667890"," And we've got four six four four zero five zero one."
"667890","672710"," On your first support, it's four zero six 64. "
"678120","679020"," Right there."
"679160","679700"," That's one."
"682060","684280"," That's two down below is. "
"687100","689560"," 40501 right where this line is right here."
"691200","693780"," We'll put this slightly lower down here."
"694480","695320"," So you can see it. "
"697540","699460"," And then down below there we have."
"702580","704420"," Four zero one eighty seven."
"709000","710280"," Right here to S three. "
"726050","726830"," That's two."
"727050","728610"," Some horse trade and going on right here."
"746580","748840"," And we've got this high above here. "
"749040","750360"," Probably want to tag that at some point."
"750480","752540"," But nice to see us actually close this gap."
"753380","754440"," Then I close this gap. "
"758300","759040"," Pairs pivot."
"775000","776980"," This is the one to show you."
"777460","780600"," For your futures, extend losses, bring crude down by three dollars a barrel. "
"782400","783300"," Four eleven."
"785200","786020"," Forty one."
"787300","788840"," I'll show you some cool this morning. "
"789400","790280"," You got to ask the question."
"791220","793760"," Well, yesterday, I've been having to ask the question a lot lately."
"794500","797880"," Not just yesterday for four fourteen fifty five. "
"799620","801120"," Four fourteen fifty five."
"808610","810410"," And we're going to address it this morning."
"811310","812390"," Four sixteen eighteen. "
"816370","817530"," Applied move is lower."
"818590","820030"," I don't see us go."
"820250","820990"," There's going to be an attack. "
"821190","821790"," Well, there's a couple things."
"822010","824150"," Number one, they're going to try to make an attack for four ten today."
"824250","824530"," It's guaranteed. "
"826010","827090"," Do they get there?"
"827730","830150"," The only thing that could probably make that happen would be."
"831430","833490"," Zero day buyers come out for tech."
"834630","837830"," Other than that, I think it's a trap for bulls. "
"839030","839150"," Above."
"841850","847520"," I think the big bulls get so used to Fridays being face rippers."
"848640","849600"," And sellers know this. "
"850640","851560"," We'll find out."
"852440","854380"," I'd be looking for a failure above today."
"855860","856660"," Let's see here. "
"856800","857540"," This is four eleven forty."
"858360","860520"," Love to see a failure above today by."
"860520","863060"," By buyers, right?"
"863240","863940"," They buy in here. "
"864800","866600"," And there's some kind of a failure above."
"868140","871100"," And then we close on a low again on the end of the day."
"872060","873140"," We'll see if that happens. "
"873780","875300"," I'm going to expect call buyers to come out, right?"
"875520","876600"," Call buyers are going to try to get out here."
"877280","878720"," Try to make some money early in the morning."
"880440","883080"," And we have this previous high above as a target right here. "
"883860","886520"," We'll talk real well out as we usually do the H line above."
"887040","888580"," We have the H line right here."
"896480","897340"," There it goes. "
"898640","903800"," And I want you to also see this one little bit of resistance here."
"906270","908150"," I'm going to show you this on the."
"911580","915940"," We're now trading above that first field lines for a bullish at this point. "
"916420","917520"," I want you to see this here."
"917720","920820"," This is at four oh six ninety three."
"921460","923860"," Pay attention to that four oh six ninety three. "
"925340","926100"," Right here."
"933570","937430"," Pay attention is why it's not showing, but this should be your while your first point of resistance"
"937430","939550"," is here your second point of resistance is here."
"946140","946740"," Excuse me. "
"946940","947560"," I need some water."
"949100","950480"," I haven't drank my water this morning."
"956820","958100"," I was so tired last night. "
"958120","958640"," I fell asleep."
"959880","961280"," In a chair last night."
"961820","963380"," I didn't go to bed last night. "
"963460","966620"," My wife threw a blanket over me like a small like throw blanket."
"968380","972340"," We'll give it four thirty this morning because I was so so beat up and worn out."
"976420","977580"," I'm going to go green here. "
"981220","981960"," Snap a line."
"982280","982820"," See if we can get up."
"983820","984260"," Snap a line. "
"984460","985940"," See if we can get up to the H line above here."
"992680","995180"," And there's one other thing I want you to see this morning."
"995180","997640"," Before I put up the book map, I want to show you one other thing here. "
"1000080","1000480"," Yes."
"1000580","1002100"," I didn't clear all these drawings off here."
"1010530","1014830"," I'll do one more thing here in the background. "
"1016150","1020110"," And the breath is not down yet either, but it is come down a ton."
"1020810","1025670"," So one positive thing is that breath has come down substantially."
"1026290","1031609"," If we hadn't seen breath come down, it would be a little more fair full for price below. "
"1032030","1033250"," We'll take a look at that today as well."
"1039960","1041900"," So you guys can see where breath is."
"1044520","1046540"," And I got something really cool for you today. "
"1050340","1051660"," You know what, we might go down here."
"1052060","1054040"," We're pretty weak on the five minute right now."
"1055000","1058720"," So we're making a reversal here to the downside and close that gap floor. "
"1059720","1060580"," Let me see here."
"1063280","1064740"," Looking at some stuff in the background."
"1080000","1082080"," Bring this over real quick before we go anywhere. "
"1083300","1085460"," Oh, here's the five minute down below right here."
"1086620","1088540"," And we make it down there and tag this."
"1091800","1096940"," So if we can get some downside moves down here, like this down here. "
"1097500","1098320"," Come down here."
"1098880","1100300"," Try to tag this down below."
"1102220","1103960"," Set 40501 right down in here. "
"1105000","1105960"," See if we can get down this."
"1106900","1109080"," And see if we can grab a buy down below here."
"1110460","1111700"," Make our way higher. "
"1111920","1113660"," We've got 409.89 above here."
"1114720","1116560"," We'll see if the buyers step in or not."
"1118160","1120140"," And look for a dip by opportunity. "
"1120840","1121440"," Kind of wild, right?"
"1122100","1122600"," Right away."
"1122840","1124540"," You can see that they're trying to buy the dip down here."
"1126660","1127380"," Over there. "
"1132430","1135650"," I wouldn't mind buying the dip down here, but I want to buy it."
"1135730","1136950"," I want to buy it like right here."
"1137810","1139350"," Some looking to be a buyer. "
"1142370","1144350"," Looking right down here to be a buyer."
"1147330","1151910"," It might leave me behind, but if I can get this down here, I would love to take that trade."
"1156180","1158000"," Love to take that trade down below. "
"1159020","1160480"," We'll see if we can get it down there."
"1160480","1162460"," We can grab it and run this higher."
"1169360","1170800"," This helps right here for you guys. "
"1176350","1177910"," And I've got a couple of things I've got to do this morning."
"1177970","1179470"," I've got to buy some baseball tickets."
"1180310","1182530"," I've got to buy some Red Sox tickets this morning. "
"1185590","1188130"," The Red Sox tickets go on sale this morning."
"1188430","1191470"," So I've got to get my opening day tickets and all that kind of stuff."
"1208220","1214990"," I've got 20 minutes until Red Sox tickets go on sale. "
"1222940","1224240"," Alright, let's say hi to you guys."
"1225240","1230760"," Red Sox tickets, zero dates, game."
"1232360","1234720"," I've got market press for you to look at. "
"1237220","1239840"," Oh, and I've got intraday stuff for you to look at."
"1241480","1242860"," You guys want to see some cool?"
"1243860","1245100"," We'll do that right now."
"1252100","1253520"," Let me show you something really neat. "
"1257000","1258240"," So let me put down the."
"1259880","1261080"," I've been asked about skew."
"1261800","1265140"," You got you really can't see like so you're going to see like an implied. "
"1266860","1270800"," You'll see like the implied move every day on the on the stock market."
"1270820","1273060"," It's hard to they don't really calculate."
"1274420","1275680"," Like so in the morning, right?"
"1275840","1276100"," What happens?"
"1276380","1279840"," So in the morning, what I do or my my daughter does is she goes to. "
"1280480","1281400"," The CME."
"1282740","1284980"," And she gets the CME numbers."
"1286940","1290020"," And the CME numbers are calculated at the end of the day. "
"1290700","1291540"," The prior day, right?"
"1291660","1292140"," Night time."
"1292480","1294080"," You can get the numbers, but they're kind of weird."
"1296280","1298200"," They don't they're not really calculated well. "
"1298500","1302240"," And then in the morning, if you can get the numbers, if you can get the numbers, like nine 30,"
"1302540","1305400"," they're much better for the gamma models for the day."
"1306460","1307140"," But they don't."
"1307260","1310920"," So when you see gamma models, they don't really show the intraday, call and put buying. "
"1313540","1314940"," So people are always wondering."
"1315260","1317760"," So at nighttime, it's hard to read skew."
"1318200","1322180"," Gam in my view with models from the from the previous night. "
"1322340","1327320"," And then the next day, the best models seem to be like after nine 30, if possible."
"1328620","1331520"," You've seen me sometimes asked for them in the morning."
"1331520","1333540"," You'll see me sometimes ask my daughter. "
"1333720","1336760"," Hey, can you run some run those gamma models for me again?"
"1338120","1343400"," You'll see people on social media say, this is past past six months or so."
"1343500","1343540"," Right?"
"1343640","1344020"," People say."
"1345160","1345680"," The. "
"1346900","1348240"," Well, what is it called the."
"1351960","1352480"," The."
"1353160","1356220"," Hold on here. "
"1356520","1357440"," I'm going to have any."
"1362340","1362860"," Yeah."
"1363080","1364780"," Max Payne indicators aren't working. "
"1365460","1367420"," You'll also notice sometimes."
"1367420","1371080"," Some of the gamma stuff that you see won't."
"1371260","1375940"," It has a hard time predicting when we have real money selling, real money buying in the market when"
"1375940","1376920"," real sellers come in. "
"1377480","1379960"," This is when the options market gets overrun."
"1381200","1383680"," The options market controls about eight to nine percent."
"1385660","1386760"," Of the stock market. "
"1387980","1392140"," And sometimes, and then you get the banks that are trying to control the options market to control"
"1392140","1392860"," the stock market."
"1392860","1397900"," And sometimes you get run over by by by real events, right?"
"1398080","1399700"," You get run over by real buying real selling."
"1401680","1407060"," So it appears that that's been rescheduled to nine forty five am eastern sign. "
"1407400","1409240"," Surely expecting comments from that phone."
"1409380","1412760"," Oh, it looks like they're going to try to try to fudge the numbers this morning, huh?"
"1417330","1417810"," Okay."
"1418050","1419830"," And so my point though behind that is. "
"1421570","1423510"," And you'll get this indicator soon."
"1425190","1425970"," But you can."
"1426730","1428770"," Is that on the actual give a."
"1429430","1431510"," I don't know what's going on with my. "
"1433830","1435070"," The background here."
"1436210","1437410"," Having a hard time."
"1437790","1438710"," What's going on here?"
"1441090","1449110"," You can see those sometimes on intraday call and put buying is. "
"1450470","1451690"," I'll show you this here."
"1452590","1456370"," So what you can see here is intraday call buying."
"1457150","1460090"," If you follow up to pull Mr. Yen and. "
"1461090","1462490"," You can see right here."
"1462650","1463710"," Watch my cursor right here."
"1463830","1463930"," Right. "
"1464170","1465250"," You can see actual."
"1467690","1470490"," On the intraday, at least one minute chart."
"1472030","1475050"," And actually see where call buying starts down here. "
"1475090","1476190"," Now this is counterintuitive."
"1477150","1481750"," You see the you see the line going up right here, but you can see the call buying that's not"
"1481750","1482770"," shown on your charts."
"1483970","1487670"," And you can actually see the ramp that takes place after that call buying. "
"1488190","1489630"," You can see it again right here."
"1490370","1491050"," Call buying."
"1492510","1492590"," Right. "
"1492870","1493010"," You can."
"1493190","1495190"," This is the last trade they made yesterday."
"1497910","1498850"," Remember this yesterday?"
"1499790","1500370"," I'm not sorry. "
"1500510","1503170"," This was the this was the last trade yesterday right here."
"1505510","1509610"," And then did you remember when I was buying calls down here and there were puts being bought not"
"1509610","1510890"," calls to see this right here."
"1512050","1515250"," We rolled it over instead right to see the divergence right here. "
"1516170","1517230"," Where the rule came."
"1519830","1520310"," And."
"1521610","1524670"," Came up here where we closed calls right here. "
"1525230","1529590"," And I was like $1.25. You actually see that there was lots of put buying in here."
"1531710","1534170"," This is where the by the dipper stepped in yesterday."
"1536570","1537710"," This was into the close. "
"1537710","1540850"," So we had lots of buying in here into the close."
"1542270","1542390"," Right."
"1542630","1543250"," It didn't matter. "
"1543390","1544530"," We kept selling down right."
"1545870","1549150"," And right here you can see call buying right here."
"1549150","1550290"," You can see call buying. "
"1552780","1554460"," See call buying right here."
"1555090","1557400"," Right on this bottom down here call buying coming up."
"1557780","1561540"," So you can actually see the intraday zero date call buying. "
"1563460","1567220"," If you can't see it on other model other modeling."
"1568320","1570100"," Right down here is where I want to be a buyer."
"1571120","1573740"," So we look in here and see if there's going to be any call buying. "
"1573840","1575900"," I'm really looking for it in the background."
"1581880","1584080"," There's some interest down here to buy calls."
"1585600","1587740"," But the five minute is very weak right now. "
"1595060","1597000"," Here's S2 S3 is above."
"1600230","1601250"," I have S3 right there."
"1601330","1601990"," There it is right there. "
"1603690","1604490"," There's S3."
"1613460","1616740"," I'm going to move my monitor over here so I can get a better better view on it."
"1623580","1624560"," I've still not seen it. "
"1628330","1629210"," 13 minutes left."
"1629450","1632050"," I've got to put you guys on a hold because I've got to buy some tickets."
"1634070","1634930"," Good morning, everybody. "
"1635090","1635530"," It's out there."
"1640830","1641710"," Still bearish here."
"1642570","1644210"," So right where we're touching right now. "
"1644210","1645550"," I want to show you we're touching here."
"1648680","1653840"," See that pen that's right right there on the daily lots of inconsistent data in the economic"
"1653840","1654500"," conditions."
"1656760","1661580"," That pen strike almost the perfect pen strike down below. "
"1662860","1665640"," And you see this crossover right here is bearish."
"1666220","1669480"," Bear is going to take one more stab at it over here and try to come down."
"1669620","1673360"," Fates by men says your guess is as good as mine is what happens next in the economy. "
"1673660","1674780"," I'm trying to make a bloodbath."
"1675040","1676940"," I don't know that they get it here."
"1677220","1679920"," They're trying to the cross over right above right here. "
"1680780","1683200"," You can see the five minute curling back up right here."
"1683780","1686700"," I will see if they can maybe do it maybe a double bottom down here."
"1686980","1687960"," I will see if they get it. "
"1688560","1693000"," Fates by men says unusually low unemployment is a great cross over right here."
"1695260","1698560"," We're going to see if the bears can get at least one more drop on here."

"1713400","1716780"," This is recent numbers are not consistent with us bringing down inflation to our goal. "
"1716780","1721160"," You had K-pop tickets."
"1721580","1725480"," We did just go to get inflation back down to our goal."
"1726300","1727740"," We did just go see. "
"1729560","1734700"," We're in this K-pop where children are in the K-pop thing right now."
"1735940","1743320"," You know teenagers are young like my teenager and then I've got a young daughter that looks up to"
"1743320","1743720"," the teenager."
"1745060","1746860"," They're in the fan club shit. "
"1746860","1748860"," So we got to like the Cape."
"1749140","1754880"," We got to like Korean stores, Korean cafes, Korean this, Korean that, Japanese this, Japanese that"
"1754880","1757900"," and my wife grew up in Japan believe it or not."
"1759260","1761600"," And I lived in Korea. "
"1765080","1767180"," It's all K-pop stuff right now."
"1767480","1773120"," We went to a K-pop or I didn't go where kids went to a K-pop show and I"
"1773120","1776040"," don't know what we have planned right now."
"1776860","1777400"," K-pop. "
"1780880","1784320"," Just retesting right now that same lower level down here."
"1784900","1787060"," We'll draw it in so you can see it on your charts."
"1788140","1790340"," Now this is that this is the daily trigger right now. "
"1791440","1793100"," I'm trying to be a buyer here if it holds."
"1798680","1803440"," That's moments as we need to continue rate hikes until we see more progress to just repeat that."
"1803740","1807260"," That's moments as we need to continue rate hikes until we see more progress. "
"1810360","1813180"," One minute is trying to scream down here and blast through it."
"1813640","1815860"," You'll see the one minute coming all the way down here."
"1817200","1818880"," Trying to push this down underneath. "
"1824060","1826360"," Starting to see some call buyers step in right now."
"1831830","1833210"," And there we go."
"1833590","1838870"," We've got 50,000 410 C's for 24 cents in the market. "
"1839450","1839870"," Shocker."
"1841030","1841750"," I wonder who that is."
"1841890","1843470"," You think that's a retail trader buying those. "
"1844130","1844890"," What do you think Bob?"
"1845230","1846550"," Those 410 C's."
"1851030","1856430"," I'm not going to guarantee it, but I bet that they moved to like 407 or 408."
"1858050","1859710"," I'm going to bet that they move up later. "
"1862440","1864180"," And that's what I my ball in here is 408."
"1882840","1885040"," Yeah, you should see it."
"1885940","1888960"," It's what so I started doing the summer concerts. "
"1890520","1893100"," And it's all women and in daughters man."
"1893240","1894520"," It's all like women."
"1894740","1895400"," And kids. "
"1896340","1900520"," And I don't know like you go to these concerts and they're like open air stuff."
"1901480","1903480"," And it smells like teenage girl."
"1904060","1909260"," Like everybody's got perfumes on and just smells really bad. "
"1909820","1911560"," I'm sure those young boys will be the same way."
"1911660","1912980"," Young kids they do."
"1913560","1914660"," They're experimenting, right?"
"1915860","1922020"," So then I went to one concert, Eric Nam or something indoors. "
"1922100","1923040"," And I was like, that's it."
"1923100","1923320"," I'm done."
"1923320","1926020"," And I was like, I can't do this anymore. "
"1926440","1928160"," So my wife's been helping out with that."
"1928360","1929120"," I'm like, I can't do this."
"1929680","1933900"," And of course, if my if my daughter's leave me for like five minutes, if they go to the bathroom. "
"1935400","1937080"," And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like the."
"1938440","1939580"," I look like the creep."
"1939920","1941380"," I look like the old creep guy. "
"1941800","1944000"," You're like, why is that guy standing alone over there?"
"1946220","1947060"," What's he doing here?"
"1947220","1947620"," Is he a furry?"
"1948140","1948620"," Is he a furry?"
"1950320","1952940"," Like what's his what's his kink?"
"1954620","1956140"," You know, don't kink shame that guy."
"1956420","1957920"," It just happens like that music."
"1959500","1960420"," They kind of stuff. "
"1962790","1964070"," So I get more than all of you out there."
"1965130","1966910"," Let's go through your chat and see what's going on."
"1967050","1967770"," Good morning, Garrett. "
"1968390","1968750"," Superman."
"1970210","1970870"," Matthew meta."
"1971130","1971510"," Jimmy Berry. "
"1972610","1974450"," Six month T bills at five point four."
"1974550","1975010"," That's not good."
"1975870","1979590"," Once T bills get up there at five percent becomes just a Jimmy's point. "
"1979590","1980830"," Now that it becomes safer."
"1981930","1983310"," Or at least that's what well."
"1984210","1989710"," Well, so if you're a bear, you want to tell people, Hey, man, put your money in a savings account. "
"1989910","1992390"," And you have safe safe five percent, right?"
"1993330","1998030"," But the truth is that inflation is so high that the real realize gains."
"1999210","1999950"," Or what?"
"2000210","2000550"," Three percent?"
"2000750","2002010"," Maybe that best."
"2002590","2004770"," Now, of course, that would be the implication that. "
"2004770","2007110"," That would leave the implication."
"2007330","2009630"," Hold on a second here."
"2013100","2020640"," That would be an implication that you'll do better in the savings account with your money than the"
"2020640","2023260"," risk that you would make in the stock market, right?"
"2023320","2028760"," Because the risk in the stock market for 10 percent gains, something like that in a year. "
"2029680","2031920"," And you weigh that against five percent gains."
"2033100","2034340"," What becomes the better option, right?"
"2034500","2035380"," But that would be a bear case."
"2035380","2039460"," Try to sell the market rate, try to push that case to sell the market down. "
"2040340","2044860"," But with that bear case of wanting to push the market down, how valid is that?"
"2045020","2050639"," Is it valid for, you know, until we hit a bottom or is it something where the market's going to"
"2050639","2052179"," straight down to one dollar or something?"
"2052699","2053480"," I think that's the difference."
"2054639","2061100"," You take it with a grain of salt and you know that it's being pushed to get the market lower"
"2061100","2063320"," to a lower price."
"2063320","2064139"," So I don't know. "
"2064199","2066440"," I feel like that works to an extent."
"2067179","2071739"," But not for, I think it's just a news of the day kind of a piece."
"2071900","2075880"," A good good job of making that point, Jimmy. "
"2076440","2077020"," Good morning, Brian."
"2077900","2083400"," We bow and we bear and Winky is asking if we're bow and we're bearing derivative yields."
"2083719","2084040"," Good morning. "
"2084360","2084800"," Where we roam?"
"2085260","2085540"," Good morning."
"2085880","2086460"," Cam H."
"2086620","2086960"," Good morning."
"2087239","2089320"," Good morning. "
"2090659","2093100"," My derivative yields asked by somebody puts at the bell."
"2093280","2093900"," I always do."
"2094360","2099020"," I always sell my calls and puts anything overnight I sell right at the bell every time. "
"2099480","2102460"," I've back tested it too many times and gotten burned too many times."
"2103400","2106020"," If they would have printed this morning, it doesn't matter to me."
"2106880","2108740"," I just take my money and run every single day. "
"2109520","2110020"," No matter what."
"2110840","2111520"," No matter what."
"2114380","2115960"," That's a rule that I have. "
"2119140","2121800"," Are you serious?"
"2122040","2123380"," There's a train derailment there to Troy."
"2125120","2126120"," I didn't know that."
"2140770","2141750"," That's not near me. "
"2142030","2142270"," Good."
"2143650","2144590"," We're now five minutes away."
"2144590","2145910"," That's a very far away from me. "
"2145970","2149970"," I'm the release of the US leading index change month of a month for cost monaster spot."
"2150170","2152010"," Three percent prior minus zero spot."
"2152010","2152470"," Eight percent. "
"2152850","2154750"," I haven't got any text on my phone either."
"2154750","2155390"," I'm probably."
"2156550","2157850"," An hour and a half. "
"2161480","2163100"," We see how far away that is from me."
"2172900","2173720"," You know what though?"
"2173860","2174720"," That wind blows my way."
"2177220","2178380"," I was looking at this morning. "
"2178500","2179260"," Thanks for saying something."
"2182600","2184020"," You did the new picture in the background."
"2184460","2185360"," I got to move it closer. "
"2186720","2188020"," Soldier puts morning all."
"2188580","2189380"," Dixie moving up."
"2189380","2189900"," Good morning. "
"2190960","2192000"," What is the H line again?"
"2192400","2198060"," H line is going to be the high lows from pre-market and the overnight."
"2198740","2200820"," I haven't looked to see what the overnight lows were yet."
"2206820","2207400"," Did you get here?"
"2209230","2210490"," I don't count into the weekend. "
"2210670","2211450"," I'm going to ask you yesterday."
"2211590","2211830"," It's up."
"2212710","2218330"," Wildcat can check the volume and calls and puts like a short call down there knocking red socks. "
"2220490","2221170"," Very smart."
"2221310","2221830"," We're by Tesla."
"2222530","2223330"," Don't worry. "
"2223750","2225450"," Nobody's watching the socks this year."
"2226470","2227090"," Miss David."
"2227290","2229090"," Oh, you guys are really ripping on the other socks. "
"2229330","2229590"," Aren't you?"
"2231920","2233480"," We see what you guys are saying down here."
"2234120","2236460"," You guys as good as minus what happens next in the economy."
"2237340","2239200"," Break of 40-50 is key level. "
"2240660","2241440"," Marco buying."
"2243480","2246280"," I'm going to see the Robin Hood alert about high volume tech differential."
"2246920","2246960"," Nope. "
"2247120","2247680"," Didn't see any of that."
"2253390","2256210"," Can't forget any gains or tax too."
"2256390","2258750"," So 5% is really 5% coming up. "
"2258830","2258950"," Yeah."
"2259090","2259670"," I agree with that too."
"2263090","2266010"," But out only if one third of my short positions still holding. "
"2266410","2266450"," Yeah."
"2266570","2267870"," I'm looking to reenter short, John."
"2267870","2274660"," I want to enter somewhere in here. "
"2275900","2276820"," If I can."
"2277320","2283700"," I want to enter short somewhere in this vicinity right up here."
"2285240","2288900"," I'd like to start another position up here. "
"2289700","2291320"," But it could go as high as this 410."
"2291680","2292940"," They're going to try for today."
"2306120","2307760"," I'm still hung over off cheap line. "
"2307920","2308280"," Bad idea."
"2308660","2309540"," Good morning, everybody."
"2309540","2314340"," I haven't looked at the implied downside move yet, but I will. "
"2315300","2316620"," Take a look at it right now for you."
"2334020","2339920"," Implied move for today is 40172."
"2341580","2344020"," Upside target, 40733. "
"2348440","2349720"," Cheap anything, headache city."
"2352980","2354060"," You have the derailments."
"2354160","2356200"," I think they're just focusing on it right now. "
"2356880","2358340"," I think the derailments are normal, aren't they?"
"2359200","2362940"," I've heard some people say they're not as normal because they've sold or they."
"2363240","2365520"," In the last union negotiation."
"2366620","2367520"," They were trying to pass. "
"2368880","2373380"," A rule where they didn't need as many people to check the switching tracks any longer."
"2373760","2376060"," And then the other thing they've done is they've."
"2377020","2381620"," Limited the number of conductor conductors, but I guess engineers they need on board. "
"2382160","2382840"," As well."
"2383180","2389890"," I don't know."
"2389890","2391350"," Maintenance and oversight on the road. "
"2396800","2397640"," I'm in a trade."
"2397800","2398600"," No, I'm looking at."
"2398900","2401340"," I want to get some 408 C's here. "
"2401420","2402280"," So I'm just watching them."
"2403220","2405600"," To grab a bottom here."
"2412600","2413280"," It's poor. "
"2413660","2414440"," What are you guys saying here?"
"2416750","2417710"," I'm trying to go."
"2418450","2419370"," Oh, yeah, John."
"2419610","2420410"," These are all these. "
"2420790","2421490"," Yeah, John."
"2421650","2421950"," Fuck."
"2422090","2423110"," No, it's not a good time to go short. "
"2423310","2423670"," These are all."
"2424290","2425630"," These are like top chasers."
"2425810","2426210"," We're on a peak. "
"2427830","2432070"," All these, all these put buyers down here are top chasers are like flip."
"2432250","2433710"," If you focus in verse, these are all the."
"2434630","2437690"," The people that didn't buy puts are now trying to buy puts here. "
"2437690","2438470"," I think we're going down."
"2439350","2441790"," I have no interest in buying puts down here."
"2442210","2443230"," Zero just calls. "
"2447540","2448020"," Go waiting."
"2451900","2452700"," Got some."
"2459200","2460360"," Just waiting here. "
"2461140","2464440"," If you're looking to buy calls, you can wait for."
"2465300","2467280"," The trade above the one in five minute."
"2467860","2468700"," Take it right here. "
"2468800","2470520"," If you like, I just grabbed some."
"2470680","2472460"," I grabbed some for 51 cents."
"2474780","2480000"," I can get a nice rip. "
"2480460","2480900"," Higher here."
"2481740","2484620"," I got the 408 if you're wondering."
"2490780","2492260"," I haven't looked at the live news yet. "
"2492440","2493200"," And I think we're swam."
"2496680","2497040"," See this."
"2499460","2500460"," Yeah, Johnny come lately. "
"2500660","2501360"," It always is."
"2501360","2501980"," Oh, shit."
"2502400","2502820"," All right. "
"2502900","2503080"," Hold on."
"2503120","2503640"," I'm going to buy my tickets."
"2503900","2504680"," Thanks for saying some. "
"2507000","2507320"," Yeah."
"2507380","2508820"," Four minutes left until I can buy tickets."
"2508820","2509780"," Thanks for saying something. "
"2510160","2510480"," Winky."
"2512640","2513080"," All right."
"2513100","2514280"," So I think I've caught up to the chat. "
"2514420","2515780"," I've missed some of what you guys have said this morning."
"2515780","2517680"," But good morning to all of you that have shown up at this point."
"2520250","2521050"," Can you add it?"
"2521330","2522250"," One fifth a minute. "
"2522290","2523730"," Wouldn't that be the perfect place to add?"
"2523890","2527830"," What's your one in five minutes set to cap the red and white lines, rearwards or sheet to their"
"2527830","2528090"," employees?"
"2528690","2530030"," I think they've gotten worse, right?"
"2533360","2534280"," They got four minutes."
"2534280","2537220"," Now trading $0.57 on 408C."
"2543450","2545550"," There is some work to be done here by bulls. "
"2546490","2547770"," They want to get above."
"2549610","2551230"," It's going to take some time here."
"2551890","2556450"," What you want to see happen here is to draw this out better for you. "
"2557070","2563370"," What you want to see happen here is for bulls to get somewhat bullish on the day."
"2564050","2564910"," They want to see."
"2567340","2567980"," Damn it. "
"2570660","2572940"," They want to see this red line cross underneath."
"2573660","2574420"," They want to see price."
"2576060","2580320"," You posted the U.S. trading index change month over month for January reports on the feed for those"
"2580320","2580660"," interested. "
"2581240","2582060"," Climb up here."
"2582960","2585540"," Retest the one minute and then make a move higher."
"2585860","2588300"," That's what you're looking for for as a bull is the retest. "
"2588580","2592540"," And then as you make the move higher, you jump in, take the long side of this trade."
"2593280","2596000"," I'm going to show it to you on a five minute chart real quick."
"2598200","2602500"," And so you can see trend is still only pauses right now or we move this way. "
"2602720","2604300"," So you guys on a five minute chart, right?"
"2605580","2610160"," On a five minute chart, we know that trend is down, right?"
"2610360","2611620"," You can see the white line."
"2611880","2613020"," Remember the crayon gang, right?"
"2613700","2617000"," White line underneath the red line is bearish, right?"
"2618520","2622000"," White line underneath is bearish or sorry."
"2622780","2624820"," White line above is bullish, right?"
"2625580","2627380"," White line above is bearish, right?"
"2629260","2631860"," Let's look at this at a larger timeframe here. "
"2632500","2633860"," So you can see what I'm talking about here."
"2634980","2638260"," White line is above or bullish when white line is below or bearish."
"2639040","2640300"," Same thing is held true, right?"
"2640520","2641740"," White white line above is bullish. "
"2642960","2644860"," White line below is bearish, right?"
"2645280","2648260"," So we're coming into this confluence again right here."
"2649760","2652720"," And, you know, our bears want to hold on to this right here, right?"
"2652720","2659480"," Bulls do not want to see, or bears, sorry, I'm fixing up my words here."
"2661240","2663340"," So bears don't want to give this up, right?"
"2663800","2670760"," And if they do give this up, they get this cross here and you see price start to climb above. "
"2671760","2672900"," You take the long trade."
"2673500","2674720"," Well, man, god damn it."
"2685970","2686370"," Okay. "
"2687110","2690950"," If you see the bulls that take over here could be a run, right?"
"2691070","2692350"," So you take the long trade here."
"2692970","2696250"," If it crosses under, you take the short trade, right?"
"2704890","2713160"," Now trading 62 cents on 408 C's."
"2716180","2717680"," And we'll look for that cross in here. "
"2717840","2719360"," You can see, we'll stay in the five minute right here."
"2720220","2721740"," You can probably take some off right here."
"2722340","2723480"," There'll be some volatility in here. "
"2723480","2725700"," There'll be volatility again at 4, 676."
"2726040","2728760"," We'll move this one down so you can see it right there."
"2729940","2733900"," There's going to be a snap and a little one right here so you can see it on each time"
"2733900","2734620"," frame here. "
"2739550","2740410"," Get rid of these."
"2741210","2742010"," Get rid of these."
"2743670","2744690"," And we'll look at the one minute here. "
"2746770","2747390"," You can see it."
"2747830","2748710"," See the one minute here."
"2749070","2750370"," Probably going to check back over here. "
"2751450","2751990"," Come back up."
"2752190","2752990"," Get another check here."
"2753930","2754210"," Target above. "
"2754210","2763720"," Now have 70,000 calls on 407 C and 70,000 calls on 406"
"2763720","2764440"," C."
"2766020","2768240"," Some big call buyers in the back here."
"2778410","2781430"," I'm going to show you something in the background here too."
"2784760","2787120"," So do you see these call buyers stepping in down here?"
"2787480","2789500"," Do you see how it's showing the call buyers?"
"2793450","2794370"," See right here. "
"2794510","2796870"," All these call buyers stepping in on the intraday."
"2801390","2803150"," This is where you can actually see them."
"2804510","2806070"," Does this prove that we go up here?"
"2806250","2806390"," No. "
"2807010","2810430"," You want to see momentum come higher and you can see momentum coming higher right here."
"2813290","2814890"," I was on five minute momentum."
"2825480","2828960"," Remember that we have some vol at 10 and then they delayed it. "
"2829140","2831580"," It looks like I need to see a consistent decline in inflation."
"2837630","2840470"," Feds Bowman says we need to continue to rate hikes until we see more progress."
"2840750","2844510"," The recent numbers not consistent with you up with us bringing down inflation to our goal. "
"2845390","2849290"," Also says we are not seeing we need to see in terms of inflation and the numbers are erratic."
"2849950","2850810"," They're not erratic."
"2851310","2852410"," They fucking timed it wrong. "
"2852990","2853690"," That's what they did."
"2855720","2856360"," That's what they did."
"2856640","2859620"," They stepped in when they shouldn't have, not stepped in when they shouldn't have. "
"2859720","2866960"," They should have removed money from the system slowly over time and let the economy play out."
"2868020","2871100"," We can't blame them because it's not like we've done anything like that."
"2871620","2877380"," I thought the moderation of inflation before the last meeting meant that we might be seeing the"
"2877380","2878500"," beginning of this inflation. "
"2878860","2881060"," The most recent data has been surprising."
"2881680","2885620"," Jobs data for January does not indicate we are slowing the economy says Feds Bowman."
"2887520","2890320"," The last time we've done anything like this was probably the GFC. "
"2890680","2892120"," We get started in the 70s."
"2892420","2894540"," This dream is sponsored by to the way."
"2894620","2902460"," The closest maybe the closest point would be. "
"2902460","2911360"," And the GFC to like we don't have the same problems as the GFC and the COVID crisis that we"
"2911360","2911560"," had."
"2916990","2921190"," Bowman had a correction of I thought the recent moderation inflation meant we were on the verge of"
"2921190","2922050"," disinflation."
"2922050","2923890"," However, the most recent data has been surprising. "
"2924370","2929970"," And Feds Bowman says the recent data indicates that our actions have yet to be effective and that"
"2929970","2935390"," we need we need to raise rates until we reach a sufficiently restrictive level that we're not there"
"2935390","2936410"," yet on interest rates."
"2936410","2937890"," Just repeat that last one."
"2938030","2941430"," So recent data says that indicates that our actions have yet to be effective. "
"2941570","2944710"," We need to raise rates until we reach a sufficiently restrictive level."
"2945030","2947730"," Just seems we're still spending at a high pace says Feds Bowman."
"2948170","2950030"," Yeah, they kind of. "
"2951250","2953610"," Well, I'm so frustrated at this point with the Fed."
"2953770","2954110"," It's like."
"2955270","2959270"," We have natural cycles in our business cycle and it's like stepping in on them. "
"2959530","2961530"," They created a new business cycle."
"2962190","2962950"," Later shortages."
"2965330","2969910"," And there were people that, you know, pissed away their money, but there are other people that"
"2969910","2972510"," didn't and they're like, Oh, no, no, I'm going to turn this money into more money. "
"2972510","2974150"," And so they're trying to step in."
"2975190","2980310"," And stop that some kind of a some kind of a mutated new business cycle."
"2980810","2982770"," And so that you know what their impact has been. "
"2983530","2986010"," It's worked, but it hasn't worked like it like it should."
"2987410","2989810"," So I'm frustrated with the Fed right now."
"2990570","2991710"," Generally speaking overall. "
"3000090","3002990"," It's moment does that that there is a lot of uncertainty going forward."
"3003190","3006050"," Geopolitical tensions could also impact energy prices."
"3008600","3010360"," I think we've got that's what we've got is the. "
"3012910","3016350"," The Monday we've got nothing scheduled for money were closed on Monday."
"3018410","3020250"," Heads up if you're making summer plans."
"3020270","3022150"," So this is what I usually make my summer vacation. "
"3022150","3028390"," So they're going to continue to raise the funds rates is necessary, says we haven't finished yet"
"3028390","3029730"," and we haven't beaten inflation."
"3031290","3035790"," If you've got a, if you're making summer vacation plans, make sure that you're looking at the fed"
"3035790","3038790"," or the market calendar for the summary of some really wonky holidays."
"3039470","3046010"," Fourth of July falls on like a Tuesday and the markets open till 1 p.m. On the third, I"
"3046010","3047090"," believe on the Monday. "
"3048570","3051650"," On Monday, so we're closed on Monday, President's Day weekend Tuesday."
"3051910","3056890"," We've got the PMI flash manufacturing class flash on services and manufacturing."
"3057110","3058610"," We've got existing home sales Wednesday. "
"3058910","3060150"," We've got the FMC minutes."
"3060330","3062250"," We know we sell into those minutes."
"3062990","3066090"," So that's February 22nd Wednesday Thursday. "
"3066850","3069490"," We have some more of all on claims."
"3070450","3070870"," We have GDP."
"3071850","3074990"," They've got Boston speaking at 10 30 that morning, 10 50 that morning. "
"3074990","3079370"," And then Friday, we've got consumer consumer spending and personal income."
"3080050","3088010"," So, so core PCE, PCE index PC as much of an impact on the market recently due to those cut"
"3088010","3094150"," with those costs actually being passed along to the consumer or not is really more important."
"3096830","3102010"," We look on the, I think that's all I got so far for the rest of the month or at"
"3102010","3103930"," least until the 24th for economic calendar. "
"3107630","3111530"," Bloomberg saying Ken Griffin scored $4 billion in wild hedge fund this year."
"3113290","3117070"," Blackrock said hedge fund star seeks $1 billion after 12% loss."
"3120360","3123860"," Extreme bets fueled $11.4 billion fortune. "
"3124320","3124860"," That's all Bloomberg."
"3133980","3135460"," What else do I see here?"
"3136020","3136620"," This is funny."
"3136820","3140000"," I see US stocks fall as Fed rate hike warning sink in. "
"3140140","3140680"," That's not true."
"3141520","3144820"," Natural gas features extending their loss to spare time around 5%."
"3144820","3154780"," That's not the reason why the Tesla recalls more than 60,000 cars due"
"3154780","3158880"," to full self driving crash risk over the year download. "
"3160460","3164220"," I always like this how they, I always like how they're like, oh, that's it."
"3164860","3166100"," Like I asked my wife last night."
"3166180","3169380"," I'm like, did you get a recall notice or something where you have to bring your card out?"
"3169640","3170300"," No, nothing. "
"3170660","3172380"," So just no more nonsense."
"3174000","3175120"," What else?"
"3176500","3177420"," They love that."
"3177620","3181360"," It's funny to how that news drops as Tesla goes down. "

"3635280","3637760"," So this is my preferred trade here. "
"3647670","3649930"," So I thought that don't have negative on the day."
"3657600","3659720"," And that is this line right here."

"3663760","3666280"," Gonna be this red line right here coming up."
"3667720","3669680"," And then a trade higher right here. "
"3678260","3679680"," That's a winner off the day."

"3714040","3714500"," Sell the minutes."
"3715180","3716220"," Buy the meetings, sell the minutes. "
"3717120","3717640"," Buy the meeting."

"3721320","3722600"," I'm not in that trade right now. "
"3722840","3725720"," I'm flat, but they are just traded 90 cents per second there."
"3726360","3727980"," I want nothing to do with this up here."
"3730440","3730880"," Nothing. "
"3731460","3733220"," I want this trade right here and that's it."

"3817920","3819340"," Where were the puts out at the open this morning?"
"3827550","3828330"," I'll look right now."
"3828710","3829030"," I'm going to look. "
"3830090","3834050"," I'm looking to the market series also noting treasuries of raising their declines with the 10-year"
"3834050","3843870"," yield to the day's low around 3.83%. 404 C's were 26 cents, right?"
"3844450","3844830"," Or no."
"3846070","3848990"," 404 C, 404 P."
"3851140","3854120"," Where were they on the open this morning?"
"3855340","3857300"," They were like two bucks or something, right?"
"3858160","3859080"," Something like that."
"3869350","3870250"," Nice, good job. "
"3873890","3875370"," Is that what they are now, Winky?"
"3876150","3881110"," What was the 404 P in that trade this morning?"
"3882010","3883310"," Was it up 800% or something?"
"3894440","3895120"," You're not at them."
"3897750","3899590"," That was part of a swing trade."
"3899790","3904830"," That was part of a, wasn't that part of a strangle?"
"3914970","3916770"," We'll look on the five minute chart real quick. "
"3920730","3922450"," Remember, this is what I'm looking for."
"3922590","3924710"," I'm looking for this red line to come down."
"3925450","3926790"," I'm looking for this white line to come up. "
"3926930","3927550"," But I don't see it."
"3928450","3929330"," Not long here."
"3933290","3939430"," I want to see price come up here. "
"3940450","3942150"," And I want to take this trade right here."
"3946400","3949540"," We'll take a look at what's going on in the background."
"3958970","3960870"," Again, some walking is going on right now. "
"3963770","3966590"," This is we're coming into a trigger right now to go higher."
"3968910","3971930"," We want to see this cross over here."
"3974010","3977250"," So I'm going to do is I'm going to, you know what I can do?"
"3977370","3978410"," I can just switch back and forth. "
"3978450","3978990"," This is awesome."
"3979930","3981710"," I don't know why I wasn't thinking of doing this."
"3981710","3987690"," So we're going to, we're going to wait and watch and see if this white line crosses over the red"
"3987690","3988210"," line here. "
"3989310","3990670"," Keep our eyes right on this."
"3994050","3996290"," We want to see this white line cross over."
"4003080","4007380"," We do not want to trade underneath, we don't want to trade underneath 40587. "
"4010000","4012000"," And I'm going to set up my next trade right now."
"4021290","4023970"," I'm looking at 406 C's."
"4024350","4026510"," I'm not in them, but I am. "
"4026710","4028150"," Look, there are $1.36 right now."
"4028270","4031530"," There's 115,000 contracts on them."
"4032890","4034470"," No, I don't want that fucking many. "
"4036610","4041050"," Right now they're $1.37. And we're going to watch."
"4043150","4046230"," See how the call buying is leveling off here."
"4047970","4049670"," See how you have call buying down here. "
"4050270","4051010"," It's leveling off."
"4052150","4053810"," I'd like to see it swoop back up."
"4054990","4058450"," You'll also see momentum is slowing slightly down there. "
"4058630","4060150"," So we're just going to ease up here for a minute."
"4060470","4061390"," So let this play out."
"4064360","4074270"," And so you can see"
"4074270","4075070"," it here in the five. "
"4078080","4079300"," See it here in the one minute."
"4081580","4082840"," So they just moved down."
"4083560","4085540"," So that, so this is humans, right?"
"4086100","4087600"," You're telling me this is humans, right?"
"4087840","4090360"," We've got 117,000 contracts that run 406. "
"4091180","4092240"," They're now on 407."
"4092740","4093480"," They just moved over."
"4095140","4097680"," So I'm back on a lower strike of 407. "
"4106540","4108479"," I want to take this so bad and I'm not going to."
"4109819","4111180"," I want to see the cross first."
"4111520","4112439"," Oh, no, no, no, no, no. "
"4112720","4113580"," I almost fat fingered."
"4125470","4126210"," There's patience here."
"4137960","4139160"," Is my stream laggy?"
"4139240","4140420"," I don't know if it is. "
"4140680","4142140"," Let me turn some shit off in the background."
"4144420","4146260"," And slow some of this data down there."
"4146340","4146680"," I've got running. "
"4147920","4156040"," I want to see this white line come above the red line."
"4156220","4156920"," So I'm looking for."
"4179319","4181399"," 47 is now trading 96 cents. "
"4181660","4182140"," I'm not in them."
"4182180","4182800"," I'm just watching them."
"4182979","4185359"," Just keep my eyes on 407 C's. "
"4185880","4187600"," They're 94 cents right now."
"4187620","4191120"," I'm just going to watch the price fluctuation in the options chain."
"4192020","4193700"," As this plays out down here. "
"4193700","4198040"," I'm starting to see a cross right now."
"4202550","4212460"," Got my finger on the by now trade 92 cents."
"4213960","4215520"," 93 cents. "
"4218030","4219580"," 90 cents getting cheap."
"4229930","4231260"," 87 cents right now."
"4234160","4237240"," Still have buyers on those tickers. "
"4241180","4242700"," 84 cents."
"4243680","4248120"," Seeing more comments from feds bark and excesses savings and fiscal spending and employers already"
"4248120","4250920"," know this may be offsetting the impact of the Fed increases."
"4251500","4254540"," Says I feel on inflation at the US is making slow progress. "
"4255020","4258560"," Now it's not taking that much signal from the recent growth and retail stage."
"4258620","4260360"," A few seasonal adjustment issues."
"4260880","4262560"," So I support 25 points. "
"4262980","4263120"," Point path."
"4263380","4268640"," I have an ability to respond to data and says a controlling inflation will require more rate"
"4268640","4269080"," increases."
"4269080","4270980"," How many we'll just have to see. "
"4271500","4274000"," And barkin also says absolutely segment."
"4274440","4279500"," Absolutely segments of the economy where inflation is slowing some like food and utilities where"
"4279500","4280300"," that is less so."
"4282860","4287700"," Again just from feds barkin there as he supports 25 faces point path as it offers less flexibility"
"4287700","4289200"," in responding to data. "
"4289740","4291480"," So I was Richmond Fed President barkin."
"4291560","4293900"," He spoke to reporters after speaking earlier today."
"4301660","4303800"," I'm going to get stopped out of the secondary tell. "
"4306490","4308250"," This stream is sponsored by ticks."
"4308470","4309330"," Right ticks."
"4309530","4312930"," Right allows you to actually hear water flowing futures for example. "
"4313350","4314190"," White line."
"4314190","4315850"," Free trial there ticks."
"4315950","4316150"," Right. "
"4316290","4318710"," Dot trade 99 cents."
"4320370","4320930"," Dollar."
"4322070","4323130"," Dollar one. "
"4324470","4325370"," Dollar two."
"4339640","4341460"," Just take the dollar to be happy."
"4345700","4347380"," Because we are rolling over here. "
"4352560","4353620"," See if I get a fill here."
"4353860","4354300"," There it goes."
"4354300","4355400"," I just sold dollar two. "
"4362240","4364180"," Trading dollar three dollar four right now."
"4365140","4367000"," We'll switch back over so you can see it."
"4369060","4372240"," Making a move higher right now to attack this previous high above. "
"4373700","4374660"," On the one minute."
"4375940","4377440"," We'll get a five minute really quick."
"4379260","4380460"," There is the five minute. "
"4383260","4385640"," Pulls want to see the crossover above."
"4387500","4389340"," Get rid of these so you can see it here."
"4390140","4391960"," Watch the white and yellow red lines. "
"4393980","4394640"," Right here."
"4394940","4396520"," And I'll probably be another buyer down here."
"4396640","4398180"," We can get right. "
"4398300","4399540"," But this is the same thing right."
"4400140","4404040"," So on this white and on this white and red line right here."
"4404080","4404740"," I want to see the cross. "
"4405540","4406900"," I want to see the blast above."
"4407200","4408060"," I want to see the consolidation."
"4408080","4409220"," I want to see the leg higher. "
"4409560","4411020"," This is the this is like I'm all committed."
"4411260","4412380"," I'm all in all day long."
"4413220","4413900"," Trade above. "
"4414920","4416580"," We'll see how this plays itself out."
"4416740","4418140"," Those are not out trading the dollar 10."
"4419280","4421240"," Some people like to call me captain. "
"4422480","4423660"," Captain paper hands."
"4424300","4425140"," I forget who it is."
"4425200","4425620"," It calls me. "
"4425700","4426260"," I think it's winky."
"4427320","4430160"," He is like a captain paper hand."
"4430340","4430680"," Something else. "
"4430780","4431520"," I forget what it is."
"4435840","4444910"," The other thing you want to be looking for here is that we every one minute."
"4444930","4445550"," We get a new high. "
"4446010","4447370"," Well, it'll show strength."
"4447930","4450690"," So on this trade higher, you want to see a new high right here."
"4450690","4453510"," You want to see a new high over four oh seven and change. "
"4454370","4456150"," Have it come back down and retest."
"4456150","4456890"," It's one minute."
"4457070","4457930"," So right here, right. "
"4458870","4461550"," On this touch right now, this is going to tell you."

"4476850","4479990"," So right now we should trade above four oh seven. "
"4481770","4485910"," So I want you to watch this as it plays out this test off the one minute."
"4486290","4488010"," You want to see this get a new high."
"4488190","4489350"," This is going to show if we have strength. "
"4490070","4491630"," If polls have strength, they're not."
"4492850","4495370"," If they get above this four zero one."
"4496290","4497290"," Four zero one. "
"4498390","4499230"," Zero three."
"4500430","4503470"," So you want to see a new high above four zero four zero."
"4503470","4504130"," Sorry. "
"4504330","4504810"," Excuse me."
"4505130","4507610"," Four zero seven zero three."

"4520760","4523140"," We'll see if they the bulls get their new high."

"4551400","4551840"," Yeah."
"4552340","4553040"," These are all rules."
"4553320","4554700"," These are all back tested rules. "
"4555880","4557960"," They work most of the time."
"4560200","4562460"," If you want to know where the bulls back is broken."
"4563440","4564560"," It's three ninety six. "
"4565960","4567420"," That's where the bulls back is broken."
"4568200","4569460"," You want to know where that is."
"4571260","4571920"," It's lower. "

"4583160","4584220"," But for today."
"4584800","4588040"," If we were to if we were to start having our zero date meltdown. "
"4589340","4591480"," We were to start having our zero date meltdown."
"4592780","4596160"," You would want to see today three ninety five and three ninety six kept broken."
"4596820","4600200"," And then especially with velocity and then you would have a valid statement. "
"4601840","4604540"," So if you want a valid statement for bulls back broken."
"4604940","4608080"," It is break three ninety five three ninety six with conviction."
"4608660","4609920"," Like you blast through that. "
"4610320","4611360"," And then you hold it."
"4611580","4614140"," If you did that and you said we just broke the bulls backs."

"4724540","4726560"," How do I, I forget how to do this stuff. "
"4727720","4728660"," Settings, maybe."

"4732240","4734620"," How do I, how do I mess with the moderators?"
"4735980","4737780"," I don't know how to mess the moderators."
"4740170","4747450"," Let me see if I can give the, give the moderators a crazy, crazy, um, powers. "
"4747450","4751640"," Uh, I don't know how to do that."

"4754620","4755040"," Anybody know?"

"4792930","4795310"," They ought to put that fucking compressor on."
"4795550","4796190"," I haven't done it yet. "
"4796290","4796990"," The crypto exchange."
"4797170","4799830"," Binance.us has no plans to exit the country."
"4801390","4806510"," The, um, let me see where the comments are, or where the moderator powers are. "
"4808190","4811470"," You have to, or I do this here."
"4812850","4813570"," Personalization, maybe."
"4814970","4819630"," Um, so you're going to get what you're going to get is you're going to get. "
"4819790","4823230"," Each line is going to have a floating, like tell you what it is where it's going."
"4824190","4828190"," It's got, you're going to also get a white paper that tells you what every, all the lines mean."
"4828570","4830570"," You're going to get what it's going to tell you what mental means. "
"4831070","4833650"," Um, so it's going to, it'll all be there."
"4834210","4837230"," You're going to get alerts that say where this or that, all that kind of stuff."
"4837710","4839310"," So we're working on it over time. "
"4839310","4841250"," This is like the next one or three months you get."
"4841650","4845990"," We started it last week and, um, you're going to get it within the next one or three months."
"4846990","4847690"," It's going to be banging. "
"4853010","4855730"," The, um, how do I do settings here?"
"4855990","4857990"," I got to check about community, maybe."
"4858590","4859190"," Here we go."
"4859390","4859730"," Here we go. "
"4860930","4861290"," Okay."
"4862130","4863410"," See who the moderators are."
"4865310","4868490"," See what we can do with moderators, like managing moderators. "
"4868970","4869130"," Okay."
"4869270","4870750"," Now you can add magic marks for channel."
"4870750","4873950"," Oh, yeah. "
"4874210","4875250"," Add a managing moderator."
"4885400","4887100"," Oh, we're, we're, we're holding out here."
"4887860","4888900"," Hold on a second here. "
"4893240","4894100"," Where is Winky?"
"4898470","4902490"," Winky face says no."
"4902670","4903370"," Oh, is that him?"
"4903490","4903790"," There he is."
"4903990","4904150"," Boom. "
"4905450","4906050"," Managing moderator."
"4906390","4907690"," Who else wants to be a managing moderator?"
"4908050","4908310"," Anybody?"
"4909830","4910830"," Thinky, are you in here?"
"4914280","4915620"," Who wants to be a managing moderator?"
"4925040","4926520"," I'll piss off the even mods."
"4930320","4933100"," So the lines change every day. "
"4933240","4934960"," The problem here is that the lines change."
"4935340","4941060"," They're not moving averages, so I have to adjust them every day so that they do for you guys on"
"4941060","4941680"," a public stream."
"4943180","4944560"," What comes with this power?"
"4945840","4947340"," There's different moderators. "
"4947780","4950760"," So I just made Winky, hold on, Winky."
"4951600","4953180"," Just Jason want to be a managing moderator."
"4954420","4957240"," So we'll start with Winky and see who else wants that power. "
"4957380","4960600"," So right now, Winky, you're here every day, 24 hours a day."
"4960720","4961080"," You never leave."
"4962620","4966860"," You and I talk after stream every day, totally at the late hours of the night. "
"4972330","4975950"," So you did right on stage."
"4976170","4976570"," I'll take a look."
"4976730","4977170"," I didn't see it. "
"4977590","4978010"," I'll look, Chase."
"4982600","4984060"," So, Winky, you're now a moderator."
"4988350","4989290"," You welcome, Scott. "
"4989590","4990130"," No worries."
"4993670","4994810"," You guys all want power."
"4994930","4995890"," I'm going to make everybody a moderator. "
"4997470","4999070"," Just have like a gang of moderators."
"5002460","5005420"," We probably will need a gang of moderators at some point, won't we?"
"5006060","5008460"," We'll probably need a gang of moderators at some point."
"5010240","5012740"," Let me ask that question again later, not at this moment. "
"5013040","5017860"," But if any of you guys there are long-term followers, I'll put you on the moderator list."
"5018500","5021720"," Because if this starts to grow to a point where it gets out of control, we're going to probably"
"5021720","5023960"," need 10 or 20 moderators."
"5026200","5028640"," OK, so hopefully you took your profit. "
"5029260","5030520"," Hopefully you took your profit here."
"5030620","5031820"," We've got a trade book down below."
"5032160","5033400"," We've got another trade above here. "
"5034280","5035900"," I said I'm a buyer down here, right?"
"5036600","5040520"," I want to see if, now you can see right here, I want to show you something here."
"5045510","5050560"," OK, traded this up right here, right?"
"5050760","5051360"," Took the money and run."
"5052180","5053040"," Took this money and ran. "
"5053320","5055700"," I told you to expect a new high."
"5055700","5058800"," Come back down and check the one minute, right?"
"5058980","5061660"," Sellers came in here and they're like, fuck you, we're not getting in."
"5061820","5062420"," You're not getting in. "
"5062620","5063020"," Screw you."
"5063480","5064280"," Stop you out."
"5064460","5065120"," I want your buyer. "
"5065800","5066680"," We screwed you over."
"5066860","5067260"," Ha, ha, ha."
"5067400","5067540"," Right?"
"5067700","5068700"," I'm not long right now. "
"5070960","5073020"," Now, what I'm looking for here is two things."
"5073860","5074600"," I want to see."
"5077500","5080340"," I want to see us come up and regain this one minute. "
"5080400","5084540"," If I don't see this regain of the one minute, I'm not going to take along here."
"5085040","5087620"," At the same time, there's one other thing that I'm looking for."
"5087720","5089640"," I'm looking for this bearish cross over here. "
"5090220","5091760"," So there's a bearish cross forming."
"5092120","5093520"," Does it mean it's going to be a bearish cross?"
"5093820","5095840"," No, but I can react to it."
"5096480","5100400"," I can look for this move here and I can look for this move right here. "
"5102800","5107200"," And if this bearish cross actually means anything, price will follow it, right?"
"5107400","5108880"," So I'm going to be paying attention to it."
"5110780","5116620"," Right up here and watch to see if they start teeing off on this for lower lows or to check"
"5116620","5119380"," this low back over here, any of that kind of stuff over here."
"5120700","5123420"," So currently at this moment, what am I looking for, right?"
"5123960","5125560"," I'm looking for, if I'm a bull, right?"
"5125680","5129720"," I'm looking for price to regain the one minute here, which it has not done yet. "
"5130640","5134440"," And I'm also looking for this retest down below at 40420."
"5135380","5139040"," Maybe they'll try to just peek in the algorithms and try to give you an extra penny down here."
"5139460","5141600"," Sometimes it just wants to check this low at 40480. "
"5141600","5143620"," So you have 40480 to look at."
"5144560","5149360"," So we're going to look at 40480, 405 or excuse me, 40598."
"5151600","5152440"," So 40598. "
"5152920","5154080"," I'm going to show you where that is."
"5154560","5159300"," We're going to draw some more boxes right in here."
"5160640","5162200"," I want to see price get above. "
"5162520","5163900"," Now I'm a buyer above, right?"
"5164800","5169080"," And then the other thing that I'm looking for is, are the bears in charge and do they want to"
"5169080","5169540"," get lower?"
"5170160","5174980"," We know that the algorithms love to get a new low, right?"
"5175240","5175540"," On the day?"
"5176540","5177720"," Just to say, ha ha."
"5178900","5180080"," I'm just joking on that."
"5181720","5182920"," No, that's just to say, ha. "
"5183420","5189680"," There's probably later in the day where they're like, the algorithms are like, algorithms are like,"
"5189880","5190480"," no, no, no, no."
"5190580","5193920"," You're feeling above and then we're coming back down here to get the new low at the end of the"
"5193920","5194840"," day, just to let you know."
"5196380","5196780"," Right. "
"5196780","5201340"," So, so we've got this one down below here, the double check."
"5202960","5205120"," The double bottom is the bulls like to say."
"5206240","5213920"," And then the other one we're looking at right here is the same area right here, 40482. "
"5215460","5217260"," And so 40482."
"5218280","5220640"," I'm going to put another box down here for the bears."
"5222600","5223000"," Right here. "
"5224760","5226380"," They're all bear targets down below."
"5237480","5239080"," Two bear targets down below here."
"5239760","5241960"," Bears want to see this white line right here. "
"5242060","5244140"," This is the one minute chart on spy of the 27."
"5245540","5250640"," And they want to see bears want to take this down right here."
"5251840","5253160"," They want to tee off on this. "
"5253940","5255540"," Run this down right here."
"5255700","5257400"," This is their path that they're looking for."
"5258360","5261800"," The sellers are looking for and they're looking for this crossover right here. "
"5263020","5264140"," Oh, the five."
"5266600","5268200"," And the one right there."
"5268360","5269900"," This fucking thing doesn't work well. "
"5270500","5274460"," Windows 11 is not happy with this drawing tool."
"5274500","5275580"," I got to get a new drawing tool."
"5276440","5277900"," That's what that's what a bear wants. "
"5278220","5278920"," What a bear wants."
"5279180","5279820"," What a bear needs."
"5280920","5282540"," What a bear wants to do. "
"5282660","5284020"," I don't care right now."
"5284280","5287360"," The only thing I'm looking for is for price to go above for."
"5290800","5292400"," Oh, six or so. "
"5295320","5296080"," Late bear."
"5296260","5297640"," They put buyers alike."
"5297920","5298320"," Fuck you. "
"5298480","5299180"," We're still short."
"5303020","5305800"," See how the call buyers have leveled off down here."
"5306000","5307060"," You can see him with my cursor. "
"5308740","5309180"," Right."
"5309280","5310460"," Call buyers have leveled off."
"5311160","5312080"," I want to see. "
"5313480","5316180"," I want to see this red line come down here."
"5316860","5318280"," And then I want to see it from the US."
"5319220","5323380"," US has successfully concluded recovery efforts of the South Carolina. "
"5324120","5325560"," Off South Carolina."
"5325580","5326800"," That did right here."
"5327400","5330340"," I want to watch this round off right here. "
"5330560","5332420"," And then I want to tag that right there."
"5332720","5332980"," Bam."
"5333760","5335140"," Start blasting off again. "

"5360190","5362810"," I'm going to check to see if they move higher."
"5369960","5371860"," See that nice ramp coming up right now. "
"5373260","5375260"," I still have no interest in this."
"5376160","5377440"," This could be a bull trap."
"5377600","5379140"," My not be, but I have no interest in it. "
"5379720","5386430"," I want to make sure that there's no bull trap going on right here."
"5386430","5387730"," That's where I want to be a buyer."
"5388230","5390030"," I don't want to be in here and watching this nonsense. "
"5390870","5391570"," Come up here."
"5391770","5392610"," Reject back down."
"5393090","5393430"," Bam. "
"5393650","5394390"," Get your double bottom."
"5395730","5397130"," Meanwhile, I should have bought down here."
"5397710","5407560"," I want to see if they can catch a new load down here. "
"5407840","5409420"," That's 404 19."
"5437670","5441290"," If I had to guess right here, this is late fares to the party."
"5441470","5446390"," I'm not positive on this, but you got to know something too that I want you guys to see something. "
"5448130","5450530"," So there's something else going on in the background."
"5450530","5451730"," It's going to take work here."
"5452210","5457420"," So if you're a bear, I want to show you something down below. "
"5459700","5461840"," So I do want to show you this if you're a bear, okay?"
"5463930","5472460"," So I want to see what bears are doing, right?"
"5472660","5474380"," I'm a buyer above here for this move higher."
"5475700","5477620"," You want to maybe wonder why I'm a buyer here."
"5477860","5478620"," Explain it to you. "
"5480240","5482800"," Now, this is pretty big support here for bulls, okay?"
"5483940","5487680"," Bears need some velocity on the downside."
"5488140","5491020"," Some momentum on the downside to break through, okay?"
"5492240","5494380"," So they need velocity, momentum of sellers."
"5496860","5500040"," And they need strength to get through this yellow line. "
"5500380","5505680"," So do they get through this yellow line possible, but they really need time on their hands."
"5506200","5507340"," So they need to stay here."
"5508260","5509620"," Sort of downward move. "
"5510020","5510740"," Let's start the baseline."
"5511500","5513380"," Let's just start with check number one, okay?"
"5513920","5515120"," The bulls need to understand."
"5516820","5520420"," I don't know why bulls can't hear this, but they don't want to hear it. "
"5522720","5525280"," We're in a rotational phase in the market, okay?"
"5526540","5531360"," And so we're trying to sell the market down to rotate out of the market and possibly rotate back in"
"5531360","5531700"," the market."
"5532380","5535980"," So the bears are in charge right now, whether you know it or not, okay?"
"5536400","5537380"," Now we can squeeze higher."
"5537380","5544220"," We can squeeze up the four away to whatever, but as time passes, as time passes, if bulls aren't"
"5544220","5545260"," able to get up here, right?"
"5546420","5549620"," And time, this is just like where we're in a bull stance, right?"
"5550480","5552060"," Same thing as when we're in a bull stance. "
"5552720","5556300"," The longer we stay in here, right?"
"5556480","5561640"," The more time it gives bears to, um, to set or to gather sellers."
"5561640","5564120"," Like, I need five sellers over here."
"5564220","5565200"," Five sellers over here. "
"5565280","5566380"," You know, 10 sellers over there."
"5566480","5567740"," Can I get another 50 over there, right?"
"5568540","5569840"," So you start getting more and more sellers."
"5570680","5578400"," And the more sellers that you get as time passes, and if price hasn't gone up to at least attack"
"5578400","5587940"," this four, four, zero, zero, nine or whatever, what happens is as more time passes, there's a high"
"5587940","5591020"," risk and chance of the market actually selling off down lower. "
"5591020","5600970"," Now, with that being said, with that being said, um, with that being said, if you do"
"5600970","5605410"," get the velocity in the downside move, the momentum in the downside move, the next target below is"
"5605410","5608110"," this 397 right here, in 395."
"5610210","5611810"," This is the last leg of the trade."
"5612090","5613830"," I post this and I kept this off this morning, right?"
"5614470","5618910"," Fire is going to attempt to take us higher, fail to do so and take us down at some point. "
"5619510","5623190"," Um, you need to have this support here breakthrough, right?"
"5623850","5628270"," Uh, and like, you know, I'll be in stream and I'll say to you, uh, bulls show us, you know,"
"5628430","5629070"," lift the dress up."
"5629230","5630350"," Bears lift your dress up."
"5630510","5631070"," Show us what's underneath. "
"5632030","5632230"," Right?"
"5632350","5633030"," Let it all hang out."
"5633730","5634090"," Right?"
"5634250","5636030"," And this is where that capitulation phases."
"5636250","5640010"," So when you hear me say bear capitulation and you want to hear me say bull capitulation. "
"5640770","5642730"," This is the first bull capitulation right here."
"5643290","5645730"," And then your second bull capitulation is down below."
"5645730","5646570"," Right?"
"5646710","5647110"," So you've got one. "
"5647430","5649590"," Let me say bear capitulation, right?"
"5650230","5651710"," That's our bulk, a bear capitulation."
"5651770","5656210"," If this chart was upside down, um, this is when we would blast down here for it."
"5656210","5659690"," So if I say full capitulation, that means we're breaking down here. "
"5659690","5661190"," We're going to get down to this next level."
"5662510","5662950"," Okay."
"5663290","5664810"," So right now if you're a bear, right?"
"5665010","5665950"," You've had your first win. "
"5666290","5667450"," This is your first W."
"5668370","5670830"," Your second W is going to be down here."
"5671430","5671970"," Second W."
"5671970","5675190"," And then your next one is below this level."
"5675770","5676130"," W."
"5676590","5682910"," Now normally how you can tell if a level, if you're a retailer, how you can tell if a level"
"5682910","5687330"," is really weak is not breaking below just a little bit like that. "
"5687690","5694430"," You need to see like, you really want to see like a blast through and then a rip higher."
"5695730","5695910"," Okay."
"5696350","5697730"," And that means that support has been broken. "
"5698250","5700010"," When you do this kind of stuff right here."
"5700730","5702350"," It's not bearish yet."
"5702830","5704170"," It's more like rotation. "
"5705030","5706150"," You need more help."
"5706510","5707690"," We're likely going to do this."
"5707890","5712250"," Now if they have more time, uh, we can break these breaks and go to the left. "
"5712510","5716210"," I told you that was on Northern Ireland."
"5716410","5718010"," I thought you'd get your last move."
"5718650","5720010"," Quick time is coming days. "
"5720030","5721990"," There's only five Twitter."
"5722930","5725490"," So we count the hours off while we count the half hours off."
"5725990","5727150"," And let that kind of stuff. "
"5728070","5734390"," Now otherwise what this looks like to me is time for sellers to sell the positions and wait to"
"5734390","5738970"," reposition higher at four, nine, fifty three or just underneath it like four, nine, four, seven or"
"5738970","5739130"," whatever."
"5739390","5743690"," And I'll tell you what, if you're a bear, uh, and you're like, I'm just balls deep short."
"5743870","5744230"," I don't care. "
"5744410","5744730"," Fuck you."
"5745130","5745990"," You better take it."
"5745990","5750770"," You better take it by three, ninety eight or so because I warn you, don't fuck with this stuff"
"5750770","5750990"," here. "
"5751190","5752590"," Uh, not on the first attempt."
"5752610","5753150"," I wouldn't."
"5753150","5759250"," Uh, this has been, this right here has been building since, um, January of. "
"5760910","5761470"," Twenty twenty two."
"5762370","5763970"," Not to be trifled with down here."
"5765210","5766450"," Not to be messed with. "
"5767270","5771630"," Not to be messed with just when you get down here, you take the money."
"5772050","5774050"," If you're a bear and you want to get below this."
"5774970","5778810"," Uh, you take your money and run and let the algorithms do the work for you. "
"5778910","5780650"," Let the hedge funds do the work for you."
"5781370","5784130"," And the hedge funds will be like, bop, bop, bop, bop, sell them through here."
"5784510","5787210"," And then you pick it back up, like comes down, blast higher. "
"5787790","5791890"," And then you know you can get down underneath to three ninety four and you're probably looking at"
"5791890","5793090"," through thirty sixty down below."
"5793990","5798050"," Uh, but this isn't, this isn't, this is like when I, what, tell bulls this shit, man."
"5798650","5801050"," Um, remember, I was telling Tesla bulls, Mike, come up to it. "
"5801170","5803710"," This is like this, pretend this is two twenty fun Tesla."
"5806010","5806790"," Pretend this is Tesla."
"5811110","5815210"," Or like do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. "
"5815210","5817310"," Again, I'm like, these sellers are up here, bro."
"5818210","5822250"," And they're going to swoop down and feed right into you like, no, man, that ain't happening."
"5822250","5823070"," And it's like, wham. "
"5823310","5824670"," And you're like, oh shit, what is that?"
"5825210","5826010"," Wham two fourteen."
"5826890","5828450"," And you're like, look, Cap, look up to seventeen."
"5828990","5830910"," Wham down to two, two, two hundred, right?"
"5831770","5834230"," And these are all these sellers above just waiting for your ass. "
"5834470","5837250"," So the same thing holds true, uh, for the bears."
"5837530","5837710"," Okay."
"5838090","5840170"," There are, there are buyers waiting down here. "
"5840850","5841770"," Like a shark."
"5843210","5843930"," A big old shark."
"5845030","5847650"," There's a bunch of programmed buying down here. "
"5848610","5851570"," You don't want to mess with it until we break through it, if you're a bear."
"5852250","5852970"," Because they're here."
"5853230","5854090"," They're like right here. "
"5854610","5856250"," They get the big jaws open."
"5856570","5857570"," And they get their big teeth open."
"5857890","5859910"," And they're thinking, they're thinking, don't worry. "
"5860110","5861810"," This is my buying opportunity right here."
"5862330","5863270"," You know, little bubbles coming up."
"5863570","5866390"," They got to go for air every once in a while and make stupid bets above. "
"5867150","5867850"," You know, like bubbles."
"5868090","5868930"," They're not quite a shark."
"5869210","5870030"," They're like a fake shark. "
"5870950","5872010"," But they're down there."
"5872230","5873910"," I want you to know if they're down here and they're waiting for you."
"5873910","5877490"," They're like, I want that fucking 396 so I can buy it so I can go higher. "
"5878030","5879650"," No, it doesn't mean this holds forever or whatever."
"5879790","5881170"," But just be aware of where you have it."
"5881250","5881390"," Okay. "
"5882970","5885410"," Is that a crayon drawn for you or what?"
"5895650","5898270"," Lots of more aggressive call buyers coming in right now."
"5898530","5899630"," Put sellers call buyers."
"5900950","5901650"," In the house. "
"5908570","5911550"," Bears looking, losing some momentum at this point."
"5912610","5914550"," Let's take a look down here and see what's going on."
"5916730","5918650"," We're going to take a look down here when the one minute start. "
"5920670","5922310"," Got your bear targets down below."
"5923930","5925930"," We didn't trade above the one minute up here."
"5926110","5927270"," We got the crossover right here. "
"5927350","5929070"," Bears crossover, right?"
"5930230","5932530"," So now I'm actually looking to be a buyer down here."
"5932630","5935090"," I'm going to look down here and see if I can get something down here."
"5938510","5941170"," I might even be a buyer right here and an adder down below. "
"5945180","5946640"," Do some adding down here."
"5954820","5956340"," I'm going to be an ad bro down here."
"5958900","5961540"," If you're like, if you live dangerously, I'm not going to be. "
"5962360","5963780"," I'm not going to buy her here."
"5965900","5967020"," This is an example."
"5967120","5968100"," This is an aggressive buyer. "
"5970700","5972560"," I'll show you what an aggressive buyer looks like."
"5973200","5974520"," It stops down there."
"5974580","5975700"," That's an aggressive buyer here. "
"5975840","5976660"," They don't fucking care."
"5978260","5980700"," Personally, I'm probably a buyer right here."
"5981580","5982660"," An adder down here. "
"5983880","5985180"," I'm probably right here."
"5986800","5987980"," I'll wear a mat right there."
"5996490","5998070"," Bears crossover right here on the one minute. "
"5998870","6000130"," Bears looking to take it down."
"6000130","6001230"," Get a new low in the day."
"6011010","6011770"," Hold on here. "
"6011870","6012770"," I'm going to do something in the background."
"6013230","6014310"," I just saw Binky."
"6019300","6020660"," Now I can't find my moderator. "
"6024420","6025740"," I need to add Binky as a moderator."
"6028880","6029880"," Where is that shit at?"
"6031540","6032100"," See that?"
"6032220","6032660"," I just had it."
"6032840","6034840"," Now I lost it. "
"6044300","6045040"," It's really cool."
"6045300","6049600"," I just hit 400,000 views."
"6050540","6050800"," Pretty cool. "
"6051740","6053220"," Jesus, 400,000."
"6053240","6053900"," That is insane."
"6054140","6054820"," Thank you, everybody. "
"6055360","6058880"," I just crossed 4,000 subscribers, too."
"6059020","6059320"," That's insane."
"6060400","6061260"," I appreciate everybody. "
"6063780","6066240"," And if you guys have been here since the beginning of..."
"6067060","6067780"," Thank you."
"6070410","6072170"," I'm kind of blown away seeing that right now."
"6075380","6075760"," Wow. "
"6081170","6081570"," That's great."
"6081790","6082050"," No, no."
"6082970","6083630"," That's insane. "
"6094420","6095760"," I don't even make a..."
"6096480","6097740"," You guys are insane, though."
"6103600","6104000"," Whew."
"6109180","6110020"," You guys are..."
"6112760","6113640"," Thank you very much. "
"6118030","6118830"," Appreciate all the viewing."
"6123440","6123960"," That's insane."
"6134380","6135500"," I don't know how to get..."
"6137900","6139720"," I need to figure out how to make Binky. "
"6140840","6141980"," A moderator here."
"6142300","6144760"," Now I'm like, I was just in there."
"6144940","6145740"," Now I'm not in there. "
"6148600","6149320"," That's wild."
"6162550","6163090"," Okay."
"6168800","6169820"," This is really weird. "
"6177680","6180840"," I just had another copyright claim, but then none was found."
"6181540","6182080"," I know."
"6183020","6184900"," I get trolls trying to copyright shit. "
"6186100","6186820"," Okay, whatever."
"6188200","6188900"," Fuck them."
"6191330","6193270"," Let me see if they can do something background here. "
"6204380","6206400"," So we tagged this box down below."
"6206600","6207440"," I'm going to delete this one."
"6209240","6210360"," So you can see it. "
"6210480","6211260"," I'm not a risky buyer."
"6211520","6212320"," I'm not buying up here."
"6212500","6214100"," So I'm down here waiting. "
"6214580","6216100"," I'll leave this one right here for you."
"6217460","6218340"," But I'm not a buyer."
"6218540","6219400"," I'm a buyer down here. "
"6220740","6222200"," I want nothing to do with it."
"6222520","6224020"," I'll take a buy up here, though, still."
"6224280","6225260"," If we get back up there. "
"6225680","6227140"," We don't get down here to this buy."
"6227480","6228280"," I'm not going to take one."
"6231520","6236380"," How do I get into..."
"6240600","6242560"," I don't know how I get into moderators again. "
"6242560","6242760"," Whatever."
"6242940","6243940"," I'm going to turn this off for now."
"6244540","6245320"," Focus back on you guys. "
"6248480","6249620"," You have to maze, dude."
"6249960","6250780"," YouTube settings are weird."
"6251120","6251640"," You get down one. "
"6252360","6256020"," You think you're going the right place and you're going to have to go another place."
"6256440","6258820"," The regular menus are kind of weird."
"6259460","6260840"," You can't get there from here. "
"6260960","6263300"," You have to go all the way back and then circle back down another path."
"6266840","6268280"," Do I think it was a DDOS attack yesterday?"
"6268720","6269780"," Well, so this is what happened."
"6270180","6275580"," So two days ago, at nighttime, I was having internet connectivity problems. "
"6275580","6282060"," And then yesterday in the morning, I was having internet connectivity problems with you guys doing"
"6282060","6282540"," a live stream."
"6282760","6283580"," So what I did was..."
"6284460","6286280"," First I tried to just run the stream again."
"6286840","6288840"," So what I did was I turned the stream off. "
"6289140","6292600"," I reset my IP address and then I have an AZUS router."
"6293580","6298720"," And it offers me to turn on DDOS protections and some other protections."
"6299460","6299980"," Two or three others. "
"6300260","6300960"," I put those on."
"6300960","6306620"," And then when I when I started the stream, no more problems."
"6307540","6310940"," I went through my logs to see where that stuff was coming from. "
"6311420","6316580"," And most of the logs said they came from Hobbit, Harry feet, porn pick site or something."
"6317680","6318180"," But I don't know."
"6318300","6319980"," I don't know how the attack was coming. "
"6320760","6323780"," But I have been in some meetings with people."
"6324780","6329960"," I've been in some meetings with people behind the scenes that have my IP address."
"6329960","6336020"," So by doing a modem reboot, now people will have my IP address. "
"6336660","6342620"," So I think it might just be contacting people on the outside and stuff like that."
"6342700","6346100"," I probably have to start using signal more often and stuff like that."
"6346780","6350080"," If I've known you for a long time, I probably have no worries. "
"6350360","6357820"," But if I haven't known you for longer than three months or six months or something, I probably need"
"6357820","6358100"," to."
"6358100","6359640"," And one other thing too."
"6359880","6361400"," There's a note to any of you out there. "
"6362220","6366340"," You'll never you'll never like I'll never just."
"6366880","6372040"," I have to make a new rule at some point soon where I'll never contact you unless I contact you"
"6372040","6373880"," publicly first on Twitter or something."
"6374360","6378140"," So like you'll never get a text or they'll never get a DM for me on Twitter. "
"6379820","6382960"," Unless I speak to you on Twitter, public."
"6382960","6386780"," So if I see you on public Twitter and I'm like, Hey, man, how you doing?"
"6388220","6391180"," Or I'll just say to you, Hey, I'm going to send you a DM."
"6391620","6394140"," Otherwise, if you get an unsolicited DM for me. "
"6395260","6401040"," Or I didn't speak to you publicly, you can send me DMS. Just if I send you a DM, you"
"6401040","6402160"," should know that I know you."
"6402260","6406280"," If I don't know you publicly on Twitter, like on the Twitter front page, but I'm not like that's"
"6406280","6406540"," funny. "
"6406860","6407640"," I'm going to send you a DM."
"6409600","6415280"," Don't don't ever respond to anyone claiming to be me on fin to it."
"6415380","6417860"," Y'all never ever contact you and ask for anything. "
"6418340","6420280"," I'll never ever ask you for money."
"6420980","6422300"," Nothing crazy like that."
"6422900","6424520"," You'll never ever see me do that shit. "
"6425160","6431120"," You'll never see me DM you for like, I don't know, dick pics or anything like that."
"6431280","6431640"," I don't know."
"6431880","6434980"," You'll never get anything sketchy from me in the background. "
"6438780","6440060"," Yeah, that's all I would say."
"6440520","6441720"," And we have people in the background."
"6442120","6443320"," So that's another thing. "
"6443420","6447620"," If anyone ever contacts you, if I ever contact you and say, Hey, everyone to be in the show, you'll"
"6447620","6451920"," eventually get a DM from someone that works with me."
"6453280","6455240"," You'll actually get a DM from Pinky."
"6455460","6460580"," I don't know if you know him or not, but if you do or don't know Pinky, you'd actually receive"
"6460580","6461900"," more information from him. "
"6463940","6467840"," And the people that I work with are your wife's boyfriend, Pinky, Pinky."
"6468020","6470140"," I mean, I should put that note out."
"6470300","6470760"," There's people now. "
"6476120","6480140"," Maybe I should write a list of who I work with so that you guys know who's in the group"
"6480140","6480500"," or whatever."
"6484310","6485410"," I like Jason Hendrix."
"6485570","6486470"," I just really put a list together. "
"6486690","6488070"," So you guys know who everyone is."
"6488650","6489590"," I'm publicly at least."
"6491910","6494790"," Yeah, when he doesn't have Twitter, but he works within the discord. "
"6496050","6497850"," And he works heavily on YouTube."
"6501600","6504280"," I trust the bounce here, but I'm not in it."
"6504540","6505240"," I need to see. "
"6506160","6509800"," I trust this bounce, but this is what I like to see here."
"6509820","6510420"," See this right here?"
"6510960","6512040"," I want to show you guys something here."
"6512220","6515140"," I want to show you something that's setting up that's kind of nasty here. "
"6516220","6521520"," This doesn't mean it's going to happen, but I never like to see this cross right here."
"6523020","6524500"," Maybe when you guys know what this means."
"6524960","6526140"," What do you probably does?"
"6526360","6526720"," See this right here?"
"6528820","6530520"," See that white line over the red line?"
"6530520","6540510"," I don't like seeing the or I don't trust this because oftentimes it'll"
"6540510","6541190"," be a bull trap. "
"6541450","6543050"," I'm going to show it to you before it happens."
"6545310","6550290"," This is where the red line crosses over the bears on parrot."
"6550390","6551890"," We'll do this color because bears aren't parade. "
"6553470","6554770"," We'll do this one right here."
"6554870","6556110"," You see something like that, right?"
"6558530","6561730"," And this will be priced right here."
"6562310","6564570"," What you see is a bull trap right here. "
"6564710","6567470"," We'll fucking bloodbath this right down here."
"6567770","6567910"," Okay."
"6568830","6570930"," Just like pure bloodbath right there. "
"6571610","6575330"," So for me at this point, I want to see price get above here."
"6578050","6581490"," I don't I'm not willing to I'm not messing around in here."
"6582190","6585530"," I don't want anything to do with that. "
"6587790","6589310"," So we'll wait and see."
"6593330","6593890"," We'll wait."
"6594030","6595270"," We'll wait and watch this unfold. "
"6595590","6595850"," What?"
"6595910","6596230"," What?"
"6596330","6597090"," Nothing to do with this."
"6603600","6605240"," You mean the crew mates were saying?"
"6606580","6606980"," Yeah."
"6607160","6607660"," The King cow. "
"6608200","6609680"," He knows what this setup is right here."
"6611360","6612960"," King cow knows what this setup is."
"6613160","6614160"," It's very bearish. "
"6614500","6618640"," Well, it's not it's not guaranteed to be very bearish, but it can become very bearish very quickly."
"6622150","6623290"," Hell yeah, the crew mates."
"6624590","6625030"," Yeah. "
"6625130","6625330"," Hell yeah."
"6625490","6626090"," The deck team."
"6631750","6634090"," This has become pretty nasty really quick. "
"6634870","6636270"," Who knows the King cow?"
"6636430","6637110"," He knows what's up."
"6637850","6639810"," King cow knows exactly what's setting up here."
"6639910","6641030"," King cows probably sitting there going. "
"6641670","6643750"," If it happens, baby, we're doing it."
"6648490","6649290"," Yeah, we are."
"6649850","6651050"," It's setting up bullish here. "
"6651230","6654110"," I just need some time doing this double check down here."
"6654650","6657750"," I'm going to take along here if this if this works itself out."
"6658390","6659390"," I'll take along here. "
"6659510","6660050"," I'm with you guys."
"6660350","6661410"," Just patience here."
"6661430","6662170"," Just have some patience. "
"6663510","6666090"," Have some patience because I know there's some bears here that are like."
"6666730","6668310"," I know what the bears are doing right here."
"6668370","6668910"," The bears are like. "
"6669290","6670570"," I'll tell you exactly the bears are doing."
"6670690","6672470"," They're just like fucking we're going to bloodbath this shit."
"6673290","6674070"," Bears right here. "
"6674190","6677030"," I tell you right now bears are like I'm going to get right in on this."
"6678810","6681570"," We're going to we're going to we're going to destroy the bulls on a Friday."
"6683750","6684770"," Now I was in the army. "
"6686170","6687230"," I was a soldier."
"6687710","6691430"," I was a soldier for four years and then I was a soldier for eight years."
"6693090","6694630"," I made a dumb mistake. "
"6695790","6699690"," Join the army to pay for college and then I rejoined the army."
"6700130","6701190"," I was like I'll join the re."
"6701250","6702350"," Well, I was going to join the art. "
"6702530","6703530"," Well, just crazy part was."
"6704450","6708150"," I was going to join the army National Guard and I went colorblind."
"6709030","6710630"," And I was a combat armed soldier. "
"6712310","6714970"," And I got I got a crazy story for you."
"6715450","6716270"," Oh, maybe I've told."
"6716430","6716870"," I don't know told. "
"6716990","6718230"," I'm not going to tell it now, but."
"6719650","6721770"," Just prior to 9 11."
"6723010","6725250"," They weren't taking prior service soldiers at all. "
"6726470","6727570"," I don't know if you believe this."
"6727690","6728530"," And that was a true story."
"6730510","6731870"," True true true true. "
"6732750","6733850"," They weren't taking sold."
"6734050","6735170"," This is how crazy was right."
"6735170","6736530"," It's how stupid I was. "
"6738110","6743570"," So I had gotten out of the army and they weren't taking prior service soldiers."
"6743570","6744470"," And I was like, I'm bored."
"6744650","6745310"," This would be so fun. "
"6745430","6746590"," I could join the National Guard."
"6747410","6749330"," You get to blow shit up and tell people what to do."
"6752630","6754550"," You know, they so much fun. "
"6756070","6757030"," Go on the weekends."
"6758390","6758970"," Drink beer."
"6760210","6761730"," All kinds of fun stuff, right?"
"6762450","6764690"," Join the Army National Guard is not the reserves. "
"6764990","6767750"," The Army National Guard, I mean, there's a bunch of guard people out there."
"6767830","6769590"," They're like, it's a serious service now, man."
"6770530","6774630"," But back then, the Army National Guard was a fun time. "
"6774930","6777070"," Like because you had state and federal government."
"6778210","6780690"," And so the Army National Guard would have fun, right?"
"6780810","6781210"," It was a blast."
"6783410","6784950"," So I was like, I'll join the guard. "
"6785190","6789510"," And I fucking failed a colorblind test."
"6790830","6795630"," They had been like color deficient, but I eventually had been legal or for them colorblind."
"6799490","6800550"," And this is crazy. "
"6800950","6802170"," This is how it started was this."
"6802310","6802830"," I couldn't get in."
"6802930","6803890"," They weren't taking prior service. "
"6804670","6806770"," So I'm like, what do I have to do to get in?"
"6807750","6810150"," And they're like, though I got denied."
"6810450","6813610"," So I went back to my original recruiter and I was like, Hey, look man, how the fuck you getting"
"6813610","6814430"," me and I have to get in."
"6815510","6817190"," This reminds me of something. "
"6817370","6821950"," This is like 2000, like early 2000, I think sometime in early 2000."
"6823270","6826970"," And so I get in the, I get in the, I get it."
"6827250","6827490"," I get it. "
"6827650","6827790"," All right."
"6827970","6828610"," I don't get it."
"6828710","6830430"," My original recruit is like, Hey, I'll get you in. "
"6830910","6834070"," Because what you have to say that you're, you've never been in the Army before."
"6834350","6836190"," And then you go to like S 11 or something."
"6837290","6839670"," At the end of your, you have to go back through basic and the IT. "
"6840490","6843290"," Or I was, oh, sit the first time, but this would, this would be."
"6843470","6847610"," Brown's is microm says we are working hard to address inflation reduction act concerns."
"6848490","6851750"," And they're like, he's like, you're going to have to say that you have no prior service. "
"6851770","6856210"," And then at the end of your training, you'll, at the end of your training, you'll, and matter of"
"6856210","6856750"," fact, I think it's changed."
"6857070","6857190"," No more."
"6857270","6857690"," Oh, sit anymore. "
"6857850","6860290"," It is a new term board or some shit, but time."
"6860350","6863070"," They're like, he's like, you have it in the Army."
"6863070","6864790"," He's like, then you tell them later on that you were. "
"6866530","6867930"," So I'd go down to maps or whatever."
"6867970","6868530"," I'd take my maps."
"6868710","6869010"," I fail. "
"6869350","6872370"," And then I get told you can't go in the Army National Guard camping combat arms."
"6873630","6874890"," I'm like, fuck, what am I going to do?"
"6876030","6881130"," So I go back and I go back to my recruiter, of course, and he's like, he can go in"
"6881130","6883590"," the Army National or the Army Reserves."
"6884770","6886710"," And take a, a rear position. "
"6886810","6887830"," So I'm like, all right, fuck it."
"6887830","6888150"," I'll do it."
"6888250","6888530"," No problem. "
"6889490","6890730"," It can't be that big of a difference."
"6891730","6892690"," So I joined that."
"6892690","6897750"," And Macron says that he and the U.S. Vice President Harris will discuss IRA concerns. "
"6898390","6900910"," I joined the U.S.A.R. so I go back in right now."
"6901070","6903110"," I pretend that I'm not a, I have no prior service."
"6904150","6906070"," I'm in hold under some shit like that. "
"6906270","6908510"," I figured, I figured out hold under and hold over our anymore."
"6908810","6909490"," Hold over our anymore."
"6910610","6911230"," Here we go. "
"6911530","6912230"," We're lying this up."
"6912410","6916410"," So I'm watching this right here for, for some weakness in the bears right now."
"6917190","6920110"," And seeing if I can catch a crossover on the upside here. "
"6922510","6923650"," And so I go."
"6924170","6926110"," So I'm watching for this right here, right?"
"6926590","6928270"," If I can get this over here, I will."
"6928450","6929290"," This is shaping up. "
"6929390","6930510"," I might be a buyer up here."
"6930970","6932230"," I'm going to become a buyer up here."
"6932330","6932510"," I might. "
"6932850","6933950"," They're teasing me right now."
"6934490","6936990"," These bears are like, this is where the bull trap is."
"6937870","6938910"," Bull traps right here. "
"6939250","6942550"," Now, I'm not saying this is a bull trap, but this is a bull trap forming."
"6943270","6946570"," This is where you take along right here and they just blast your ass down."
"6946570","6948090"," We tag right here. "
"6948490","6949210"," And you're fucked."
"6949970","6950210"," Right?"
"6951130","6951610"," So."
"6953170","6954290"," And you're totally fucked. "
"6954370","6955310"," I'm still a buyer down here."
"6955450","6957270"," I'm not pretty much trusting this bullshit at all."
"6957730","6958690"," The buyer right here. "
"6959890","6961250"," I don't trust this at all."
"6962730","6964270"," There are my stops down here."
"6964610","6965790"," I'm betting it's down in here. "
"6966350","6966590"," So."
"6968150","6970010"," Let me move this above higher here."
"6971690","6973430"," I'm betting these bears are up here. "
"6973530","6974690"," Just waiting to pounce on me."
"6975790","6976190"," So."

"9934700","9939040"," a normal fluctuation if they can't do it in options market They can't do it with real money selling"
"9939040","9943560"," they're going to blame it on some kind of bullshit that they make up So just be honest just be"
"9943560","9948560"," or just keep the idea that Heading into march 17th. "
"9948560","9955840"," They likely want to keep it underneath 4060 at a minimum And if they if we go down to 3600"

"11646200","11654790"," I know there are people on fin to it That are screaming about it right now Now there's a problem"
"11654790","11660190"," here So this is what i'm trying to tell you about if I was the Fed president Fed president wants"
"11660190","11666630"," to see us Come down here But not get velocity too much right now."
"11666630","11673570"," They want the velocity, but then but not like not down here So they got to talk the market down"
"11674670","11679190"," And then we'll talk the market back up and we'll talk to market back down and we'll talk to market"
"11679190","11687450"," back up until they choose to to cut The flora from underneath you now in that time period You're"
"11687450","11694210"," buying dips right Just looking for lows Then you'll DCA the last one and that's where you get your"
"11694210","11694510"," trough."
"11694830","11696410"," That's where you get your your bottom of your trough. "
"11696550","11703850"," So over here You're actually in your trough Then you have that one capitulation moment now in this"
"11703850","11706790"," capitulation moment that goes down really not like that's not 360."
"11706790","11717470"," It's lower but Maybe that does a better job of it We're in this trough down here And"
"11717470","11721390"," you're gonna have one major capitulation moment at some point whenever that happens if it's there"
"11721970","11728930"," Here doesn't matter the only thing I'll warn you of is when that happens You don't fucking sell You"
"11728930","11737470"," actually add Now this you're just adding up here But if you get panic and people are telling you"
"11737470","11742170"," publicly not to add you add down here no matter what You're also going to hear bears tell you why"
"11742170","11747850"," bother or DCA down here There are instances where we don't ever come back down here and do this"
"11747850","11757510"," stuff many of them There are many many instances of us not doing this this last move down A prime"
"11757510","11765570"," example is a Prime example is 2020 we actually went down I think 10 percent one day two days went"
"11765570","11771210"," down like 10 percent And they were bears screaming they were like see we haven't hit bottom."
"11771270","11774870"," We haven't had our capitulation moment yet That wasn't the capitulation when we're still going down"
"11775510","11780670"," And we just left bears behind often running and that's kind of where we are right here right now"
"11781410","11789950"," They don't want to see us Just start cranking higher Does that make sense they want in down here"
"11791210","11795210"," Now we might go down there and get it But you know if you're just down here adding as a"
"11795210","11799970"," retailer in 10 years you're more than likely going to look back on this You need to remember me"
"11800490","11808510"," You're going to say he was right Out of these lows You add if there is a capitulation moment We"
"11808510","11812230"," don't like 10 years time you're going to be like fuck yeah I don't know what you should add. "
"11812350","11816250"," I can't give you any advice on when you buy the dip This isn't a financial advice at all."
"11816310","11822570"," This is just Showing you what they're thinking I don't think you should buy the dip."
"11822770","11826970"," I think you should have do your own due diligence, but You should look back on the history and see"
"11826970","11853260"," what that we'll see what it is so that you know what you're talking about That makes sense That's"
"11853260","11858900"," what all the screaming is about That's what all these these bankers are doing these bankers don't"
"11858900","11863320"," care about you These bankers don't want the market to get out of control They don't want to get run"
"11863320","11868600"," over And the Fed doesn't want to get run over either You know j-pow wants to talk this mid"

"13379730","13385910"," Um is what they're looking for If they can't get this they at least if they even if they tag"
"13385910","13391630"," it that a minimum bear wants to be down here and stay under here Uh for hopefully that that 396"

"13448670","13455470"," able to put this together and get underneath this convincingly to me Uh, hold on the bear is able"
"13455470","13459730"," to get underneath this convincingly to me Uh, to me this is just all noise."
"13459950","13460970"," This is grinding up people. "
"13461190","13466110"," I want nothing to do with this Uh, but I don't mind shorting this underneath if the bears can get"
"13466110","13471850"," under here with convincing I'll take that short with them, but I'm not I'm not gonna take that"

"13491850","13496390"," a four dollar putt and it's fucking 10 cents And then I never I'm like upside down on the trade. "
"13496650","13502610"," I'm like not timing this right And the real reason for this too is Uh, as we begin to roll"
"13502610","13506030"," over you want to jump in here Don't want to be jumping in right here."
"13506290","13511930"," This is the moves already been made So for me at least I don't want any to do it Um"

"13524290","13524970"," fast here."
"13524990","13529870"," We're going to run through get your pen and papers out get no peta whatever you need to do ung"
"13542400","13551440"," Look at all that bearishness on ung Now ung Uh, you know, I like ung, but I don't like it"

"13561040","13566680"," minute on ung You guys have uh, this red one right here on the one minute. "
"13566860","13567680"," This is right now."

"13593860","13594900"," So i'm not even gonna look at this any further."
"13595100","13601920"," There's no point Um, you need to see a crossover here for you to even begin to get bullish At"
"13601920","13609220"," any rate currently if it does cross but if today it crosses above $7.76 Um at this moment your"
"13609220","13613260"," next trade is $8.18. I don't even want to look at this chart because it's not even worth looking"
"13613260","13618400"," at Um to be honest with you the best trade is above with a three trigger. "
"13618700","13624020"," So we're not even at the three trigger yet Uh, to me, it's a dead ticker At the moment I"
"13624020","13629060"," really want to see like the three triggers so that it really blasts up So i'm not a fan it"
"13629060","13633580"," has work to do in my view you might get a small squeeze for like 20 30 cents But for"

"13697250","13704710"," flat i'm a buyer at 200 flat on cat It's gonna be an emotional trade right here for for bulls"
"13708940","13716880"," I this is showing me too that Uh, the Dow is probably going to fall more than S by then"
"13716880","13722560"," spy No, that's what it shows me I'm not a buyer here in cat."
"13722740","13734640"," Even if it goes up not a buyer uh, zim Must"

"13748540","13757860"," higher to 25 bucks um hasn't happened yet Nothing's changed with zim right Here's your cell down"
"13757860","13767670"," below right here Uh still consolidating Right"
"13767670","13769650"," down here just consolidating right here."
"13769730","13772870"," That's all i'm seeing this as Uh for a leg higher."
"13772910","13778410"," It's holding up very well at this point I will tell you that so zim is holding up very well. "
"13778610","13785490"," It looks like it's being bought by hedge funds Uh to disprove that would be to uh a buy and"
"13785490","13789690"," hold below 20 bucks Unzim I like it like taker."
"13789690","13794470"," I like the stock I don't like buying it right here."
"13795010","13803250"," I'd like to buy it down here Momentum is still coming up on zim Momentum is still coming up still"
"13803250","13809350"," bullish Seems to get a good reaction off of uh 20 bucks right now. "

"13816850","13829520"," It's doing a good job snow Barris was all fuck on snow I"
"13829520","13844760"," shouldn't be but I am now Currently in snow I'm"
"13844760","13849900"," barris Price started down below of at least 150 On uh on snow."
"13850060","13852440"," Is it coming into a dip buy in snow?"
"13852940","13855620"," I don't know. "
"13855700","13862110"," Let me check and see I mean it looks like it's gonna get dip bought here and try to make"
"13862110","13862610"," a fight higher."
"13862710","13866090"," I'm afraid of snow What am I afraid of is in snow right here?"
"13866390","13876320"," We'll talk about snow here more depth Look at snow just fucking snow looks"
"13876320","13884240"," like snow looks like it's lost two of its props Uh, you want me to get bear or bullish on"
"13884240","13884780"," snow, right?"
"13886240","13895120"," I know you do uh tough place for snow like um We'll go on a larger time frame here Gotta"

"13906440","13908580"," So snow like see this right here. "
"13908700","13915080"," This isn't good for snow Uh, but even so even saying that Uh, people want to buy dips down here"
"13915080","13928260"," like 117, but the truth is probably at a hundred bucks Uh, let me see here Uh, most"
"13928260","13935260"," sure it makes bigger point straight line Uh snows and it can currently it's showing its in"
"13935260","13935640"," consolidation."
"13936460","13944640"," I bet you I bet you're gonna get Uh at least the dip buy at 100 Um, I wouldn't be"
"13944640","13953300"," shocked to see snow that 100 bucks Uh, what what invalidates this for me on snow though is, um, not"
"13953300","13958360"," a valid this would be tight stops on this one Uh, if you don't get like if you don't get"
"13958360","13967240"," a reaction on 100 bucks, it's tight stops below because it could begin a next leg lower Um It could"
"13967240","13971920"," could be a consolidate and then just start making its blood bath down Just be careful of snow."
"13972080","13978600"," I like snow the ticker of the company, uh, but I'm probably a buyer at 100 bucks With that said"
"13979880","13992620"," With that said my all my bearishness that I have with that said I'll get bullish again on snow I'll"
"13992620","14003260"," get bullish again snow if it breaks above Breaks above and holds Not just play pops its head up I'd"
"14003260","14008540"," be a buyer of snow at 165 bucks right now and I would trade it to um 203 be the"
"14008540","14018170"," first place Right there and uh, this next place would be a sell for me probably 220"
"14018170","14029900"," flat Somewhere up in there And"
"14029900","14033300"," I'm not like if this is you know, you guys give me tickers. "
"14033400","14038140"," They're just like tassel It's gonna be the same fucking this is the same shit as tassela Not"
"14038140","14045000"," bullish on on snow right here until it shows me Until it shows me consolidation that the markets"
"14045000","14051260"," moving higher than 220 like the actual stock market Right like we come up here."
"14051460","14051980"," We come up here."
"14052060","14052560"," We come up here. "
"14052640","14060480"," We start showing So if you like pull on snow man, like I don't say to you like um It"
"14060480","14066900"," needs to be it needs to be like uh, it needs to be like showing me shit Like it needs"
"14066900","14072200"," to be like boom big moves higher outside of that I don't want to hear it like they don't they"
"14072200","14077340"," say it's the same as every other tech stock Until until you get some big moves higher in the market"
"14077340","14084480"," in general I don't want to hear it like I honestly don't and I I don't think 100 holds I"
"14084480","14090180"," think if we have a plunge and I'll tell you this about snow If they're traded off 100 bucks If"
"14090180","14095680"," it's let's say that trading to snow up 100 bucks, you better be available to buy like 50 60 30"
"14096300","14098760"," 10 If we get that plunge down."
"14098900","14105340"," This is one of those tickers High beta ticker that will turn into a high beta ticker It's one of"
"14105340","14111800"," these ones that um is that danger for that last plunge So like you might see the spy go only"
"14111800","14114420"," go down at 3000 But you'll see fucking snow go to like 10 bucks."
"14114720","14121020"," So this is a very dangerous stock right here in my view You know like i'm willing to buy tesla"
"14121020","14129900"," at 60 45 65 45 uh if tesla went to 10 bucks it wouldn't wouldn't shock me so uh full"
"14129900","14138200"," disclosure if you're trading snow Not for a minute would it shock me not from it wouldn't blink it"
"14138200","14148590"," wouldn't be like oh I didn't see that coming High beta stock so be careful on snow So Uh, try"
"14148590","14151750"," I would like date trading it or weekly trading it. "
"14151750","14159690"," I'd be looking for 100 bucks down here And if we if we hit 100 bucks, let me know Uh,"
"14159950","14160790"," it's tough one man."
"14160910","14168670"," Snow is a tough one in my view Not financial advice not a recommendation to buy or sell any of"
"14168670","14180240"," this stuff, but for me It that I mean that ticker to me looks like it needs reprising so The"
"14180240","14181300"," same thing over here, right?"

"14192320","14201920"," bucks And uh, I think it can come up here, but again, you've got like a sell above here You"
"14201920","14211080"," know this you maybe add this to your list Of tickers you want to own on the last capitulation You"
"14211080","14219680"," know like $100 $60 $40 Uh, it can be traded higher here Uh with tight stops, right?"
"14219940","14227300"," You can you can buy it here at 200 bucks with a stop underneath it But the moment you break"
"14227300","14228600"," 200 bucks, it's on man."
"14228760","14232680"," It's on my Kong and this this ticker too Like a lot of these stickers are gonna look the same"
"14232680","14239080"," the market tends to move The same but not always like you see like Tesla lose more value than the"
"14239080","14249160"," rest of the market And this is one of them is another one um Fire again above like It's"
"14249160","14252860"," I don't like saying this stuff because I know bulls are like I hate you for this for saying this"
"14253860","14257520"," Um, the truth is There's another high beta stock to some extent. "
"14257800","14263520"," I love in phase Uh, joe donut follows me and we were so we were trained into end phase when"
