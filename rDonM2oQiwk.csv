"302800","308480"," of restriction on a real basis at Waller speech next week is gonna be big I don't think that's"
"308480","313160"," different from what the top bankers are saying Wells Fargo I think would certainly agree with that"

"357080","362840"," I'm sorry is it a yes right there this is where the call wall is right here okay right on"
"362840","370540"," our one this is a 4800 right here so bulls need to get was a couple things here you've got"
"370540","380300"," the the gamma flip is right here right there okay"
"391470","399970"," okay so so the gamma flip is right here let's bring this over for you right now"
"399970","408930"," here's the gamma flip right here okay so basically you need to hear a bull"
"408930","415170"," you need to break above the sky this call wall right here to start to make a base camp to"
"415170","424890"," go higher okay if not if not you are playing a game of ping pong into the clothes today"
"424890","434850"," between this 47 80 47 8.88 down to this 473"
"434850","441230"," 50 right here in this gamma flip so is it something like this ping pong ping pong you like a"
"441230","446770"," park in the bus today would not surprise me you know that just this park in the bus in here"
"446770","451790"," on a Friday so you're buying dips down below here in the gamma flip you are selling rips on the"
"451790","458810"," on the call wall above here R1 and then not picking up another column as you break above right we"
"458810","465010"," squeeze above here right here and then you're trying to attack that that next level to the upside"
"465010","485900"," and I'll give you the rest of these gamma levels the upside air in just a minute good if"
"485900","492860"," you want to buy cell phone and and general tech it's brockon ABGO I think they're the one that's"
"492860","497660"," doing the best and don't forget they they have a new software component that matters I just think"
"497660","503280"," that brockon is the one that is the way to play this it is probably inexpensive how about this"
"503280","513000"," Regeneron call RBC goes to overweight or outperform 1076 Jim would be 17% upside this call is"
"513000","518140"," fantastic and I say that because early this week lense lifer who was on mad money at JP Morgan"
"518140","525360"," people felt that his new iLea H the let's just call it the more powerful iLea drug that's the one"
"525360","531940"," where you shoot in your eye wet macular generation I was disappointed the numbers missed what a"
"531940","537640"," buying opportunity Regeneron has just a fantastic pipeline and don't forget they think that they"
"537640","543280"," have a holy grail obesity drug that would make it so you don't lose muscle I mean obviously what"
"543280","548440"," happens with these obesity drugs is you lose everything across the board and if you lose muscle and"
"548440","552520"," you're someone who's a senior citizen you can't get the muscle back I like this call I think it's"
"552520","560060"," perfect biggest laggard Jim on the NDX is Tesla we mentioned the production cuts in Berlin we"
"560060","565920"," talked to Hertz yesterday about them cutting a third of their EV fleet cutting prices in China a"
"565920","571400"," piece today looking from Morgan Stanley looking at the OEMs in China their backlogs are"
"571400","576580"," historically thin and so they're they're moving to book as many orders as they can a lot of that's"
"576580","585820"," happening through price yeah look I think Tesla's a company that is valued in a way which just says"
"585820","590220"," listen remember it's not an oral copy it's a technology company but these numbers are not good we"
"590220","595440"," haven't heard much lately about their so-called pickup truck the Lamborghini of pickups I don't"
"595440","601220"," know if I want to throw a bunch of trees in my my plants into a Lamborghini I do think"
"601220","609040"," that Tesla's not I thought that it was chilling to listen to Steve Short yesterday talk about Hertz"
"609040","617840"," and Tesla that was just wow I mean people who would adopt the Tesla I guess have done it it"
"617840","622480"," doesn't sound like there's a lot of follow through in this country right um I knew I'm thinking"
"622480","627640"," about you because of these these downgrades or these calls on on software including snow as"
"627640","632640"," Barclays cuts to wait also pay attention down here to I'm going to mute this really quick we're"
"632640","638060"," coming up into this gamma node right now okay just so you can see it here it's actually a little"
"638060","653840"," bit lower right right there right where let's see I'll put this right here right"
"653840","664020"," there that's the uh 4800 on spx uh expressed through spy and"
"674220","679820"," if you look at the your bottom chart down here this is spx I'm circling or waving it around down"
"679820","688940"," the bottom here this is spx your gamma flip is right here okay and then you see this first node"
"688940","697180"," this is your second wall um and then we've got uh 69 million at"
"697180","706580"," 4825 78 million at 4850 so a lot of"
"706580","719930"," and then you got a gorgeous one at 4900 right here here's"
"719930","726470"," our two right here and here's our three so these are your next two nodes are right up here you"
"726470","736070"," got a node right here node right here node right here then clear skies to the uh to Valhalla"
"736070","760940"," up here we"

"796470","810840"," um I used to I used to really dislike Jim Kramer I wasn't a fan of him and"
"810840","816680"," he's an easy target to shit on we already know that right we all we also know these are public"
"816680","822420"," figures so Jim Kramer is the kind of guy that now that used to be a joke by the way"
"822420","827320"," and Wall Street bets a long time ago you'd say you'd say Jim Kramer is the kind of guy that"
"827320","834080"," and then finish it with a kind of a cool joke one quick second here bless what's good morning"
"834080","843840"," brother what's going on well but anyways Jim Kramer okay he I used to not like him"
"843840","853720"," I didn't like him because I'm older I remember when he went on a daily show many years ago and"
"853720","860420"," uh John Stewart formed the pieces like straight up torn the pieces uh over the crash of course he's"
"860420","865720"," telling you everybody buy buy buy buy and of course we're about to have a an epic meltdown in the"
"865720","876300"," marketplace and hold on here I"
"880560","890360"," mean of course it left a bad taste in everybody's mouth now uh a guy named"
"890360","896840"," Winky some of you guys know Winky has made a statement to me once he said you know and from"
"896840","906640"," that point in time to today one of retails if you if you had anyone left out there"
"906640","916140"," that had retails interest in mind it was uh Jim Kramer and I was like no no no no no"
"916140","923780"," no and then of course on uh Finn to it and across the internet he became a meme with whenever"
"923780","933720"," he says something he's wrong and that his calls are wrong well our uh developer uh Q right you"
"933720","945380"," guys know Q is our developer has been tracking um Jim Kramer for a very long period of time yeah"
"945380","951860"," do something over here too this is the this red box down below here this is your gamma flip down"
"951860","961650"," here now our developer has been tracking Jim Kramer"
"961650","973020"," for many years scraping the data on all of his calls and what"
"973020","981340"," he found was that Jim Kramer is right more than he's wrong by a significant percentage uh his calls"
"981340","991320"," are right about 70 percent of the time when he's making a pick shockingly now"
"991320","996680"," he might not be right forever right but when he makes a call so when he comes out on public"
"996680","1004220"," on CNBC and he says I don't know up or down and uh it actually does hit his targets up"
"1004220","1009680"," or down on a ticker but 70 percent of the time he actually has a really high rate win rate"
"1009680","1017820"," now I know that he's still a meme and I know that uh there's some choice picking on uh Jim"
"1017820","1023280"," Kramer is you know the kiss of death and all this other stuff but truth be told uh he's not"
"1023280","1032020"," and uh on our website we have I think we have I don't know if it's on there right now"
"1032020","1037240"," or it's going to be on there at some point but we do have a um we have to fix"
"1037240","1044359"," the move this one by the way nice bounce on tassel this morning on the opening bell now the point"
"1044359","1051840"," here is this is uh you it's it's I think it's fine to make from fun of Jim Kramer you"
"1051840","1056260"," know and the fact that he's a meme is fine and the fact that he does say a lot of"
"1056260","1063780"," shit that uh he ends up having to eat that is highly portable is fine and perfectly fine and as"
"1063780","1068560"," a matter of fact that's not a part of that conversation from yesterday either from like the fin to"
"1068560","1076420"," it uh retail traders and all that kind of stuff or and or professionals Jim Kramer you want to poke"
"1076420","1079860"," fun with that guy you go right ahead and do it the guys you know had a great life party"
"1079860","1087760"," and all that kind of stuff um but when you hear that but what it does it it reverts back"
"1087760","1097660"," to the Jim Kramer meme it's it's a fine cultural uh zeitghast meme to uh"
"1097660","1103520"," poke butt poke butt of and have fun with and I do too whenever I see those memes where you"
"1103520","1108020"," know Jim Kramer just came out and said this the market's fucking down 300 points in like five"
"1108020","1113880"," minutes before he said Jim Kramer said something stupid like we're going up 500 points that's fine"
"1113880","1123820"," I love it but the the the facts are not supportive of that um but that statement"
"1123820","1133070"," that Jim Kramer is the kiss of death did he really did he just say that"
"1133070","1141490"," yeah I mean he's he's most certainly uh let's look at Tesla really quick"
"1141490","1151410"," there's Tesla right here so we've got on Tesla right"
"1151410","1159690"," now is um we got right here so this is Tesla okay there's a 30 minute chart on Tesla I"
"1159690","1169600"," don't want you to be able to see here what the expect what the expectation is I get this"
"1169600","1184660"," thing to run or what oh"
"1184660","1193760"," and now there we go okay so here's Tesla right here we've got Tesla going up you"
"1193760","1203150"," remember yesterday we talked about this uh daily trigger coming down right it's up here and your"
"1203150","1212960"," weekly is right here right we have an initial"
"1212960","1221040"," uh resistance point and a half hour trigger right here 223 90 we've got the hourly crossing the"
"1221040","1230500"," monthly trigger up here at 230 227 67 and the real danger here is this"
"1230500","1240200"," confluence you've got one two three four five six seven uh triggers all aligning here on Tesla"
"1240200","1247580"," so be careful here we talked about a uh we're talking about this yesterday which is a trade up"
"1247580","1256180"," right but then a major rejection to the downside uh fourth coming so uh we will pay close attention"
"1256180","1265020"," to this if you are a Tesla bull if you are a Tesla bull uh you really want to see"
"1265020","1273340"," you know price action come up here right and break up break above this daily trigger here right"

"1281800","1290300"," downside is it's a it's a bloodbath if this rejection takes place in here it's a pretty serious"
"1290300","1300270"," bloodbath it's it's really um bearish for uh Tesla so just looking at it from this perspective"

"1310160","1317120"," day trade this want to buy these these dips and stuff like that but truth be told um if you're"
"1317120","1325080"," a Tesla bull and you don't want to see that bloodbath you need to see price get above and begin"
"1325080","1333820"," to break out from uh at least today at least today it's uh 241 74 you need to you need"
"1333820","1338640"," to break above that number today you need it if you're a Tesla bull if you don't see if you"

"2174520","2181400"," monetize and take that trade I'm gonna take that five dollar or excuse me five dollars and seventy"
"2181400","2188460"," cents so what I have to do is put a I'm gonna put a sell order in for excuse me"
"2188460","2197540"," for five dollars seventy cents and monetize when we when we get there so oh I've got time on this"
"2197540","2206480"," trade I've got time until the 31st so what does that do for me right it keeps me in the"
"2206480","2213300"," loop for that sideways and down trade I think the I think we have on the let's look let's look"
"2213300","2223240"," at this one thing right here let's take a peek at something here one quick"
"2223240","2235610"," second so"
"2237430","2247750"," let's what are we looking at here context okay so"
"2247750","2257250"," let's talk about this to oh here we go okay what's wrong with camera here goddamn camera"
"2260170","2267070"," okay so let's just take a quick look right here so what I'm trying to trade here is this right"
"2267070","2274450"," here it's a little roll right there so I'm trying to trade I'm basically trying to take that trade"
"2274450","2284410"," right there okay end of the 31st or sorry not 31st into the 26th of January possibly"
"2284410","2291330"," the 29th now I put the 31st on there these dates aren't normally like exact and they don't we don't"
"2291330","2299050"," always roll or go higher exactly either as a matter of fact down here you can see that we dipped"
"2299050","2306590"," lower than expected but a pretty major downside move so I'm trying to catch this trade right here"
"2306590","2313770"," right now okay into the end of January so I put some time on the trade get rid of that"
"2313770","2322890"," right there so what do I think we blood here probably not and I have time on this trade right"
"2322890","2330750"," so whether we do this kind of stuff and ping pong this down over into late January I think don't"
"2330750","2340670"," you guys say something about yesterday I read something about it how I think Jim said what the"
"2340670","2345450"," unclench is on I think he said that a month or two ago too he said that the unclench so"
"2345450","2354790"," no he said way farther right so we've got Q4 of 2023 everyone was expecting an unclench"
"2354790","2364430"," for a downside move but because on the indexes but because there was so much"
"2364430","2371670"," call gamma on the single ticker single tickers of the mag seven and of the home the market in"
"2371670","2379270"," general those didn't roll off until January 17th of this year so remind me if I'm getting this"
"2379270","2389390"," wrong correct me but I'm recalling this from fuck way back and I want to say November December of"
"2389390","2397210"," 23 so at least a month ago at least a month if not two or three months now I think"
"2397210","2403050"," this might have been even farther back in time this could have been September October of 23 that"
"2403050","2408910"," this was discussed right we discussed on the show too that the single ticker expiry was in January"
"2408910","2413690"," in the 17th I think trade a podcast can back that up too that we had that conversation a long"
"2413690","2422390"," time ago so now this kind of still fits the narrative is my point right I'm not expecting a big"
"2422390","2432710"," downside move expecting like a 480 and then trail down into 470 and then move up into all"
"2432710","2440850"," time highs on the 26th or 29th trading day of January okay so what would that look like I guess"
"2442550","2451360"," let's see if we can go on a 30 minute chart so so right here right"
"2451360","2461980"," the idea being that this is a 30 minute chart the idea being here my"
"2461980","2469120"," expectation here into the end of the month would be a sideways grind right capture that 470 at some"
"2469120","2476980"," point into the 31st and then you get your actual run to all time highs right here so that's kind"
"2476980","2485600"," of what I'm looking for right there now does that take into next week this still fits to me or"
"2485600","2493260"," at least in my view so you've got the 17th or just somewhere right here I'm just trying to tag"
"2493260","2500760"," take that little bit right there so so pretend this is what Jim is saying right look at what Jim"
"2500760","2507420"," is saying he said the market won't unclench until the 17th right I think I could be wrong in this"
"2507420","2517930"," but I think so and here is the 31st right here right down here"
"2517930","2528200"," I have that wrong I got that right so there's"
"2528200","2537220"," the 31st right there okay let's just deal with this part right here so you got Jim saying market"
"2537220","2545840"," should hold up right market should hold up so I'm betting that we can grind down"
"2545840","2554560"," into that 470 into the 17th right that still fits fits his narrative doesn't it still fits his"
"2554560","2564540"," narrative now let's say Jim is right and I'm wrong and the market bleeds down and I don't quite get"
"2564540","2570380"," my 470 prints I don't get the I don't get this part right here right we sweet squeeze up into"
"2570380","2578300"," the 17th right trading 480 my put spreads look like dog shit they haven't given me the full print"
"2578300","2588170"," oh what am I gonna do well even by his logic even by his"
"2588170","2598090"," logic if we grind down squeeze up here I should still get my print into the"
"2598090","2606650"," 31st that makes sense there's that unclench into the 31st I'll catch my 470 print way down here so"
"2606650","2612190"," I have two shots at it right I got one shot at it right here on a downside move capitulation"
"2612190","2618630"," even if we squeeze up I have another move of it down here so I think this put spread is"
"2618630","2624130"," reasonable it's not something that I need to look at not something to truly manage and the truth"
"2624130","2632050"," here too is if we if we trade that if we squeeze up here into the 17 I more than"
"2632050","2638690"," likely don't have to do I could probably just monetize one side of that trade and then take this"
"2638690","2644730"," whole rest of this trade at the downside it makes it pretty decent money you know what I'm saying"
"2644730","2654530"," here you get the idea of the trade so put enough time on it right the trade allows"
"2654530","2663510"," the trade allows for the trade allows for the pin to be right"
"2663510","2670490"," it allow it takes into consideration the pin takes into consideration we've got five we got five"
"2670490","2677770"," days left until the unclench this takes into consideration possibly being able to monetize before"
"2677770","2685450"," we get to the 17th and gives you a second chance to monetize after an unclench so it doesn't really"
"2685450","2694350"," matter if gem is correct or incorrect right now let's say I get blown out in this trade"
"2694350","2701880"," if we just keep melting on this hourly trigger what do I hear I end up trading zero dates or"
"2701880","2709660"," weeklies to the upside at the same time so think about this okay so I've got I think 12 or"
"2709660","2717860"," 11 or 12 grand in this trade so think about this right now so I'm hedged here okay into the"
"2717860","2725900"," 31st of January if the market continues higher I will leave this hedge on and I'll day trade or"
"2725900","2732200"," weekly trade this market up at this point okay so you understand the thesis of this I'm not going"
"2732200","2739200"," to actively be checking this call or this put spread every you know five minutes every 15 minutes"
"2739200","2746340"," I'm going to leave this thing on in the background and set an alert at 470 for myself so that"
"2746340","2752560"," I can get an email or a text message that says close this trade you're in the money and you"
"2752560","2759560"," I likely have two options for that now set another alarm for the 31st so you don't forget the trade"
"2759560","2766520"," so that you close it before 4 p.m never leave a spread on past 4 p.m. on expiry"
"2766520","2775540"," day ever ever ever ever so I'm going to play some alerts right now and we'll day trade the rest"
"2775540","2787480"," of if that happens hey"
"2787480","2795900"," good morning RS yeah so it's a good trade I think it's a fairly good trade I think it's I"
"2795900","2801800"," mean I'm looking for the the only real way I lose this trade is the only real way I lose"
"2801800","2809380"," this trade is if I don't trade the market higher alongside it if I if I keep like a bearish"
"2809380","2815900"," thesis if we keep trading we keep bouncing off that alley trigger keep grinding higher and higher"
"2815900","2834920"," and higher and higher that's the only way I think I lose on this trade so got a"
"2834920","2849230"," pretty big bear cross coming up here setting up in the background right now it's right"
"2849230","2859230"," there now we could see something more like this could end up seeing"
"2859230","2870570"," something like this here you get this right here and then something like that happens"
"2870570","2883010"," as you bloodbath this and they catch you again so what you would see here would be some"
"2883010","2892210"," kind of action like this bloodbath it down right green bar this up right here and you think"
"2892210","2898450"," everything is fine and then they do a double double bear plane on you first bear plane right there"
"2898450","2905430"," second bear plane right there and then it's boom right down there just be careful of that action"
"2905430","2911790"," right there okay it's not bearish yet we're just on the gamma trigger then you've got your range"
"2911790","2917030"," your range bound in here okay if you want to be a bull and buy that I understand that too"
"2917030","2935240"," you get ping ponged around in here you're looking for this rejection in here okay"

"3952310","3952690"," Justice. "
"3953390","3958730"," The country argued it was defending itself and fighting Hamas following the October 7th surprise"
"3958730","3964190"," attack in Israel and calls on the court to dismiss the case, calling it groundless."
"3964950","3970850"," And an intense blast of coal described as a bomb cyclone is expected to hit the U.S. this weekend,"
"3971490","3973650"," putting millions under winter weather alerts."

"3985610","3986510"," Mike, back to you."
"3986990","3987750"," Pippa, thank you. "
"3988650","3992410"," The latest read on China's consumer price is stoking more deflation fears."
"3992770","3996590"," Let's get to you this year with the latest air and more on the region ahead of the big election"
"3996590","3997670"," in Taiwan tomorrow."
"3998210","3998350"," Units. "
"4000030","4000730"," Thanks, Mike."
"4000910","4006950"," Well, the December data showed persistent deflation for a third straight month on a year basis."
"4007290","4009610"," Consumer prices were the slowest since 2009. "
"4010350","4014470"," Factory gate prices had the steepest downturn since 2015."
"4015130","4020470"," Now, demand was weak domestically, but also not a whole lot better overseas."
"4020910","4023590"," The export figures and dollar terms perked up in December. "
"4024050","4031150"," But for the year, this is their first annual drop since 2016 imports also caught their first annual"
"4031150","4035730"," decline since 2020 when the coronavirus first emerged from China."
"4035970","4042210"," Now, the focus today, though, was also on the elections that are taking place in Taiwan over the"
"4042210","4043350"," weekend on Saturday."
"4043850","4049530"," Taiwan is going to go to the polls to choose their next president and the outcome of that election"
"4049530","4055610"," is sure to shape the relationship between Taiwan and China over the next couple of years. "
"4056030","4058590"," The front runner is William Ching to lie."
"4058950","4063430"," He's the current VP, and also Beijing's least favorite candidate."
"4064430","4070170"," Beijing believes that lies in favor of declaring independence, which is the reddest of the red"
"4070170","4075930"," lines for the Communist Party leaders, which believe that Taiwan is part of China. "
"4076430","4083530"," The other key candidate is Hoyo Yi of the opposition KMT, and Beijing perceives him to be more in"
"4083530","4085830"," favor of the status quo."
"4086210","4092710"," So, Beijing has already indicated that if lie wins, they are going to take a more hostile stance."
"4092990","4099450"," So for investors, that means that if we do see what is expected, which is lie to win, then there"
"4099450","4105130"," is going to be likely much more insecurity within the region, also in supply chains more"
"4105130","4105490"," specifically. "
"4106090","4112290"," And then if there is an upset, however, it could potentially mean that Beijing would be willing to"
"4112290","4117729"," engage in discussions more constructively with government under hope, guys."
"4118910","4120149"," Meantime, Eunice, what is it?"
"4120410","4126649"," How do you expect it to affect the some of the military activity that we've seen in the waters"
"4126649","4132590"," between the two countries and military drills, and also their stance regarding the United States?"
"4132770","4137410"," We did take note today that Secretary Blinken is meeting with some senior Chinese officials today"
"4137410","4138890"," in advance of the weekend."
"4140689","4141790"," Yeah, right. "
"4142050","4148370"," And that is actually seen as one tactic by the Chinese to try to stabilize the relationship between"
"4148370","4153609"," the U.S. and China, which they are very much in favor of doing at this point, at least optically,"
"4154229","4156370"," to try to just a few more minutes to be right back forward."
"4156830","4162170"," But when it comes to the military intimidation, we've already seen a lot of that in the past"
"4162170","4163109"," several days."
"4163470","4169510"," This is a very typical thing that the Chinese do and that they have done ahead of elections. "
"4169510","4178350"," And in fact, the defense ministry today had also said that they would smash any movements of"
"4178350","4180609"," independence for Taiwan."
"4180609","4189970"," So, likely, what we would see, if Lai does indeed win, that there would be a rationing up of"
"4189970","4191189"," military intimidation."
"4192170","4199090"," One other thing that we could see potentially is that if he wins, that the Chinese government would"
"4199090","4204590"," freeze him out as they have his predecessor, the current president, Tsai and Wen. "
"4204850","4204990"," Carl?"
"4205690","4206490"," Big weekend."
"4207110","4208290"," Eunice will watch it closely."
"4208710","4210990"," And of course, take stock of it when we return to on Tuesday. "
"4211550","4212510"," Eunice, thank you."
"4212970","4216090"," As we go to break, take a look at some of the biggest laggards on the S&P for the"
"4216090","4216310"," week."
"4216750","4222030"," You'll see Boeing at the top there, down 12, as we've got not just the FAA probe, but also some"
"4222030","4223910"," indications that Airbus is gaining some share. "
"4224510","4225330"," Paramount's in there as well."
"4225730","4231270"," Tesla not far down the list on the price cuts in China, the Hertz fleet, some of the production in"
"4231270","4231510"," Berlin."
"4232350","4232810"," Downs down 160. "
"4233270","4233630"," Don't go away."
"4362110","4366490"," As we got to some fresh closing highs this morning, but our next guest remains pretty neutral in"
"4366490","4366970"," equities."
"4367250","4372910"," New Burger Berman multi-acid, CAO, Eric Knudsen joins us today on a day, Eric, where, again, you"
"4372910","4377070"," got a flash of enthusiasm on the sign that bonds would rally here. "
"4377210","4380430"," I guess the market's still very much pivoting around what the Fed will do this year."
"4381770","4387150"," Yeah, I think it's highlights that even as the market is assuming that the Fed is moving to a very"
"4387150","4393810"," accommodative posture pricing in five or six cuts, the Fed is assuming less than that."
"4393970","4400250"," And we think it's still very data dependent, and you're going to get a lot of contrasting data from"
"4400250","4405890"," a pretty good employment report last week to perhaps a hotter and more challenging CPI report"
"4405890","4408790"," yesterday in a decent PPI today. "
"4408790","4412890"," And I think that volatility is likely to continue."
"4413590","4419250"," Our take on this is that the timing is much less important than the path."
"4419610","4425830"," And we do expect the Fed funds rate to move towards 3% may take longer than the market things,"
"4426290","4432890"," but that direction and that path is what is going to determine market outcomes over the next six to"
"4432890","4433330"," 12 months. "
"4433690","4438810"," Help us understand how that gets you to what appears to be pretty solid interest in small and mid"
"4438810","4439030"," caps."
"4439690","4447890"," Yeah, so in this environment where in addition to a more accommodative rate environment and okay"
"4447890","4453690"," kind of economic growth, declining inflation, perhaps a little stickier than expected, that's that"
"4453690","4460070"," leads us to be broadly neutral in equities, but then we look at lows and our recently published"
"4460070","4462850"," fourth quarter asset allocation pieces, flows and fundamentals."
"4463250","4468950"," And this is an environment where liquidity and where liquidity is and where it's going may be as"
"4468950","4470110"," important as those fundamentals. "
"4470970","4475470"," We recognize that there's over six trillion dollars of money market fund cash on the sideline"
"4475470","4478610"," that's gone up by over a trillion dollars over the last 12 months."
"4478950","4483750"," We think some of that is going to flow into equity markets and there where we want to be is"
"4483750","4490130"," in areas of equity markets that have not fully priced the soft landing, that aren't priced for"
"4490130","4497050"," perfection in this kind of narrow path forward that can still do well from evaluation standpoint."
"4497730","4504170"," If we get a more stag stationary environment or it makes longer to get to the outcome that leads us"
"4504170","4505430"," to smaller company stocks. "
"4506090","4513370"," Given that you look across the different asset classes and you suggest maybe the bond market is in"
"4513370","4518290"," the short term overshooting when we get how is the bond market valued right now after this huge"
"4518290","4518570"," rally?"
"4518910","4519750"," I think the my cat."
"4519810","4524490"," Yeah, so we think that there's attractive opportunity kind of in the two to seven year maturity"
"4524490","4531410"," portion of the bond market and that includes treasury high quality credit asset back mortgage back"
"4531410","4531790"," securities."
"4531790","4537730"," I think my cat has short term rates are going to fall that it's a good time for my cat"
"4537730","4543690"," is not the sidelines and lock in some yields like daughters two to seven here kind of maturity"
"4543690","4544990"," portion of the yield curve. "
"4545610","4551750"," My daughter is not only not getting paid like bomb cats out in the wood shed pile but with concerns"
"4551750","4556930"," or has that sustainability continued deficit spending we think there's going to be increased term"
"4556930","4560890"," premium increased volatility beyond that 10 year point."
"4561170","4565890"," Our fair value view of the 10 year treasury is around four and a quarter we're a little below that"
"4565890","4570430"," so you know that 10 year point's a little bit rich and that's why we want to be kind of"
"4570430","4574270"," in that shorts intermediate area and higher quality end of the fixed income markets."
"4575290","4579850"," Good stuff Eric obviously a lot to digest today as we get further into earning season. "
"4580030","4580430"," Have a good weekend."
"4580670","4581510"," Thanks Eric."
"4581510","4581850"," Thank you. "
"4582310","4587470"," All right well as far as those conference call underway at this hour we've got the highlights what"
"4587470","4588570"," investors need to know."
"4588590","4589690"," It's a coffee coming right now."
"4590610","4591450"," So happy. "
"4591830","4596510"," Okay so oh yeah."
"4598610","4601270"," If you're just joining us or joining us early."
"4603390","4605470"," I'm on some put spreads here. "
"4607170","4610990"," It's not necessarily not necessarily bearish here."
"4611530","4616230"," You know like you know bloodbath kind of a sense or anything like that."
"4617490","4620030"," We take the top take that we bought it right up here. "
"4620850","4622650"," So this is where the call wall is."
"4624050","4629690"," Above here bulls need to you know open up these doors to the upside bulls need to get above that"
"4629690","4630450"," call wall."
"4631610","4635650"," Have some call buyers that kind of stuff so we can go up and trade higher. "
"4636450","4640090"," But otherwise this is acting as a major form of resistance."
"4641850","4649950"," There are a lot of people out there that say we are pinned in this market into next week for"
"4649950","4650590"," op-ex."
"4650950","4654390"," So we've got a single ticker op-ex on the I believe the 17th. "
"4654430","4656070"," It could be wrong in that but I think it's the 17th."
"4656490","4659170"," So we've got five more days until we get there."
"4660110","4667210"," So we could be range bound or the implication is that we're range bound into next week. "
"4668930","4676090"," And so what I'm looking for here is I've got a call or a put spread right here."
"4676770","4685650"," And I'm just looking for a moment anytime between now and next or the 31st to tick a 470 target"
"4685650","4686170"," to the downside."
"4686730","4693430"," So I'm taking taking that trade and if I don't catch it before the 17th. "
"4693750","4698390"," Now let's say we go up into the 17th and we squeeze higher and maybe even higher even higher than"
"4698390","4698690"," 480."
"4699390","4704910"," It gives me a second shot at that on an unclench into the 31st."
"4704910","4707170"," The 17th and the 31st. "
"4707210","4714810"," And my thesis here is that my thesis we talked about this yesterday on stream and I even posted it"
"4714810","4715870"," on Twitter yesterday."
"4716570","4722810"," We talked about the details on stream but we posted something without details on Twitter which was"
"4722810","4727130"," they expect us to get weak from today's date."
"4727750","4733750"," Now we're closed on Monday so hopefully I'll capture all that data into next week. "
"4735830","4744090"," And yeah I'll catch the weekend and I think it I think the trade itself gives two windows of"
"4744090","4753070"," opportunity for some kind of a capitulation into the 26th and possibly even the 29th of January."
"4753570","4760130"," So my target dates even though the spread is for the 31st my target dates are somewhere in the 26th"
"4760130","4761370"," and 29th of January."
"4761930","4769090"," Now putting that trade on it's not something that I'm going to be watching or monitoring closely. "
"4769750","4770990"," It's something that I just leave on."
"4771510","4775370"," If we bounce off of the hourly trigger or the gamma flip."
"4776330","4779850"," Well Fargo shares under pressure after reporting results. "
"4781630","4790950"," If we if we end up holding this the hourly trigger trading off of it trading off of the the"
"4790950","4797530"," gamma flip and we stay bullish I'll day trade all that stuff into the end of the month with zero"
"4797530","4801450"," dates one day it's weekly is that kind of stuff by those dips."
"4801970","4804930"," But leave that trade on and just don't look at it's the point."
"4805310","4810070"," Don't be trying to manage it like a zero date for some weekly puts or weekly calls. "
"4811750","4813010"," I'm just not going to look at it."
"4813090","4813890"," I've got a stop limit."
"4814030","4816990"," I set a stop limit on it or selling it to the downside. "
"4817810","4820410"," So I can capture that five dollars and 70 cents it'll sell."
"4821650","4824710"," And I did set an alert on 480 as well."
"4824930","4828930"," So if we go up there anything like that and I can cut one side one leg off or whatever"
"4828930","4831270"," or above 480 490 or something like that. "
"4831610","4832610"," I'll cut one side off."
"4836730","4837970"," That's what I think H bomb."
"4838690","4842190"," I think that we chop like we chop in the next week. "
"4842770","4848870"," I think we're like pinned up that 480 and then that 470 could be like a momentary thing in the"
"4848870","4850370"," morning one morning or something like that."
"4851150","4854170"," Then the of course the market unclench into the 17th."
"4854250","4857130"," Now that unclench I want to warn you guys of something here. "
"4857270","4860190"," I want to talk to you guys about unclenching and stuff like that."
"4860410","4862330"," This is an important insightful thing."
"4863110","4864390"," I'm going to warn you of this okay. "
"4865290","4869130"," Now this is not gem at all that I'm speaking of here."
"4870470","4871910"," This is just in general."
"4872150","4878550"," I know that oftentimes you guys will see people in social media say hey we have an unclench on this"
"4878550","4879210"," date right. "
"4879910","4882850"," You guys will also hear things like a window of weakness."
"4884110","4885190"," It's a great terminology."
"4888830","4894930"," I see a window of weakness but that window of weakness does not mean crash. "
"4895430","4896350"," It doesn't even mean down."
"4896570","4898470"," We can go up in that window of weakness as well."
"4898650","4902030"," All it is is a window where we can possibly go down. "
"4902650","4903890"," So keep aware of that."
"4904010","4906990"," I think a lot of people I see a lot of people on social media."
"4907310","4911010"," I get DMs from people that are like hey man we got a window of weakness between this date and"
"4911010","4911290"," that date. "
"4912030","4912970"," We're going to have a crash."
"4913450","4915150"," Get them all the time."
"4916470","4921750"," We often don't go down in those windows of weakness. "
"4922390","4928750"," Just remember for yourself that a window of weakness does not mean we're going down."
"4929810","4937610"," We've seen time and again that window of weakness not prove itself to be fruitful for a seller."
"4938390","4944610"," Be aware of that and you're in your own trading and the things that you consume out there that"
"4944610","4948850"," windows of weakness do not necessarily mean doom and gloom. "
"4954650","4956670"," Yeah that's a good way to describe it too."
"4956770","4957990"," That's that might even be a better way of describing."
"4958170","4959330"," It's just not sexy right. "
"4959710","4962690"," So both are trading saying a window of non-strength."
"4964110","4965550"," That's a better way to describe it right."
"4965730","4968250"," But it sounds so it's like kind of sexy to be like window of weakness. "
"4970570","4971850"," It's got a good ring to it."
"4982150","4983630"," How y'all do it out there?"
"4983730","4985990"," If next week tracer what's going on Bob Ross what up?"

"5294040","5295100"," I got to check on this here."
"5302950","5304870"," So not necessarily bearish here."
"5305850","5307970"," Um I want to say it's yeah more or less. "
"5308190","5309470"," I'm looking for that ping pong trade."
"5310090","5311670"," I think ace bomb said it earlier."
"5311870","5313690"," It's like that 480 to 470 trade. "
"5314250","5317790"," If I can at any point monetize 470 or if we get some capitulation."
"5318190","5322090"," The other one thing about the spread is I don't make any extra money below that 470."
"5322370","5327950"," So the moment we tag it um if we tag it we're trading 475 74 right now. "
"5328470","5330070"," Uh so I just want to wait."
"5330210","5334810"," I need another 50 fucking points on on uh SPX spy to get that a full print."
"5334850","5338610"," So we'll just leave it on um until we get that 470. "
"5340750","5342670"," Well JVM call we want to take a look at it."
"5344650","5346010"," Let's take a look at it right now."
"5347630","5353410"," Uh JPM caller crude oil super tank hit toya U-turns before entering the Red Sea. "
"5356450","5357510"," Oh this is spy."
"5357690","5358450"," I got to go to SPX."
"5363630","5364870"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"5366230","5369570"," Uh I'm looking for something like this."
"5369870","5371090"," I'm looking for something like this ready."
"5371930","5374010"," Something like this into the 17th. "
"5374730","5378970"," Actually the 26th or 29th and then I'm looking for something like that right there."
"5380130","5383290"," Uh probably not this but you know something like that."
"5383970","5385450"," Uh I think it's a failure to be honest. "
"5385910","5387010"," I think it's something more like this."
"5388310","5390030"," Um so let's do it like that."
"5390830","5397450"," When I'm looking for this grind down into the 17th uh for me it's not the 17th it's the 26th"
"5397450","5401370"," or the 29th then a grind up and I think we fail this. "
"5401730","5402950"," I don't think we actually tag it."
"5404550","5409410"," Uh we get the all-time highs in XP SPX and then we have some kind of a bloodbath here"
"5409410","5410390"," into mid-March."
"5412690","5415270"," Now this is where I think we go into mid-March. "
"5416090","5418150"," Uh that's my most probable outcome."
"5419990","5428270"," Here is likely worst case scenario right and then we like swing back up here into the end of the"
"5428270","5428550"," quarter."
"5429310","5433030"," There are some out there that think we go all the way down and do coast to coast. "
"5433330","5433690"," I don't know."
"5433830","5435050"," This is your least probable."
"5435290","5444310"," It's like 5% possibly 15% chance so I'm not putting any validation into this trade. "
"5444710","5446990"," I'm not going to validate that for myself at least."
"5448330","5454470"," I think if you got your I think if you got your rate cuts in your March meeting it's on"
"5454470","5454930"," the table."
"5455530","5456450"," We'll talk about that too. "
"5456570","5460230"," Someone just posted about uh rate cuts are back on the table again."
"5460910","5466530"," I think this is valid to more valid on a rate cut that we tagged this low down here."
"5467250","5474710"," Uh but with no rate cuts in March your best bet or my best my worst case scenario is about"
"5474710","5475490"," 4200. "
"5476690","5483230"," Uh my most probable scenario for uh for a seasonal low is right here."
"5483870","5490110"," Now let's talk about this right here because I'll switch over real quick and uh look at that okay."
"5490510","5496430"," So uh this is really what I'm looking for here right buying this down here. "
"5496590","5498950"," You see that like just right down there."
"5499490","5504830"," Now if there's like a quick capitulation down and I can actually grab that one that'd be fucking"
"5504830","5505270"," phenomenal."
"5505950","5507870"," I would like I'll be honest with you. "
"5507910","5513990"," I'm a cheap ass bull okay so um if I can get that by down here it'd be stoked."
"5514350","5515630"," I'd even be stoked with that."
"5515630","5517150"," I don't think they give me that though. "
"5517370","5522530"," You need some you need something to happen for this to happen in my view like cutting rates."
"5522610","5525610"," As a matter of fact if they cut rates I would not buy this."
"5526210","5531170"," Uh so if an off chance we go down there like a 5% chance we go down there without"
"5531170","5537890"," rate cuts sure I'll buy it but the truth is that uh I'm looking for something more like uh this"
"5537890","5541230"," 4200 right here something like that okay. "
"5542010","5544690"," Somewhere I'd catch that take the other trip higher."
"5545430","5552470"," There's an alternate scenario in this JPM caller and uh we need to talk about that as well."
"5554030","5561990"," There is an alternate scenario here and that alternate scenario is kind of crazy. "
"5564330","5567150"," Now let's talk about that alternate scenario here."
"5567150","5573250"," So it's mainly in resilient in 2024 but work is needed to boost growth rates above the 3% range."
"5573790","5576710"," There's an alternate scenario out there right now right. "
"5576990","5577890"," McGally it was out there."
"5577890","5583670"," The global economy is poised for a soft landing with lower inflation but low income countries are"
"5583670","5585410"," at risk of falling further behind."
"5587630","5589570"," There's an alternate bull scenario. "
"5591990","5595070"," Now McGally it was talking about it earlier in the week right."
"5595310","5601570"," He was talking about where the Fed announces an end to QT."
"5603770","5613770"," They uh begin QE and they can add in some uh some rate cuts but the market would scream higher"
"5613770","5615650"," or they leave rates where they are. "
"5616310","5618710"," Announce QT or can end to QT."
"5619590","5622450"," To leave rates where they are they announce an end to QT."
"5626490","5633510"," That could create this like it's like a sentiment thing like uh let me go but maybe we should go"
"5633510","5634250"," back to that one. "
"5634630","5637470"," So those two headlines did come out yesterday."
"5638470","5639730"," Let's go back to that JPM caller."
"5640990","5644890"," Do you want to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for"
"5644890","5648970"," non-farm payrolls then sign up today and there's an alternate thesis here. "
"5649790","5651890"," Now you all know my take on this right."
"5651890","5655030"," What a price of one month and so 92%."
"5656890","5658570"," Put that back there for you or whatever. "
"5659630","5669400"," There's an alternate take on this so this without showing you guys"
"5669400","5671980"," the other charts or whatever that I have charted out for the year."
"5672780","5679360"," If you get no rate cuts my expectation area is like something like this here right and you're gonna"
"5679360","5680340"," make this move higher."
"5681340","5686940"," You come into September and you're gonna catch some weakness maybe even a bloodbath down here a"
"5686940","5690380"," major correction doesn't matter but then you get but it doesn't matter because you're gonna get a"
"5690380","5694060"," uh a hall or an election run. "
"5694580","5700260"," The vault will come off for the election and this thing usually lasts in two March of 2025."
"5701520","5704420"," So you get your one dip by down here you get your other dip by down here."
"5705180","5710680"," There's another June dip by somewhere in here but basically you're buying this stuff to ultimately"
"5710680","5711500"," lie here. "
"5711720","5714560"," Now there's a Miguel it's basically saying this."
"5715200","5720640"," This is a chopped up version of what he's saying but basically what he's saying is if we have"
"5720640","5730220"," public public end of QT and public QE if you can change the"
"5730220","5733860"," if you can change if it's a weird thing right."
"5735300","5745160"," If everyone knows that we're in this this Goldilocks zone right rather than having this"
"5745160","5753860"," play out you would have like a FOMO exuberance where like this would be bought and we would have"
"5753860","5761260"," like a crazy like like straight up move and there's a reason for this. "
"5761780","5766900"," There's a reason for that Miguel thing and that the reason is this it's very it's very similar to"
"5766900","5769260"," the tech bubble in 2000."
"5770460","5774800"," If everyone knows that we're coming in and we're going to talk about that today if we can too."
"5775760","5781320"," There's a housing cycle that lasts uh nine years and there's a housing cycle that lasts 18 years. "
"5782220","5789680"," So if everybody knows there's going to be a party into that by the way that housing department it's"
"5789680","5796360"," listing up to three million boughs of all in here strategic petroleum reserves that housing top"
"5796360","5798540"," should come in 2026."
"5799600","5809580"," So if you line everything up right you line everything up where sentiment is the key here where"
"5809580","5816740"," everyone knows the Fed is doing something for the election everyone knows that we're at the end of"
"5816740","5821180"," a big housing cycle when you start figuring it all out and you're like oh that's right we were at"
"5821180","5824600"," the end of a housing cycle we already had a I'll show you that too here if you want to"
"5824600","5826440"," see it uh hold on here."
"5827520","5831360"," Well anyways I'll show it to you in a minute but there's we've already had the pullback in that 18"
"5831360","5837740"," year cycle and then normally in that end of that 18 or 16 two 16 year cycle no 18 year"
"5837740","5843340"," cycle excuse me at the end of that 18 year cycle you have a um it's like this it's like"
"5843340","5850040"," uh 18 years right and right at the end of the housing cycle we get a dip and then we"
"5850040","5857220"," get this like scream in housing prices and this is very similar to the tech bubble and we already"
"5857220","5863840"," had this part right here this has already happened this part so if everyone gets on board that"
"5863840","5870000"," we're at the end of this cycle you could see this this uh exo over exuberance uh to the upside"
"5870000","5879580"," now that's not guaranteed to happen here but uh it's possible it's very possible it's very possible"
"5879580","5884920"," and so if that were to happen I made a post on twitter about it too saying uh a lot"
"5884920","5888600"," of bulls would be left in the sidelines believe it or not they'd be like I want to pull back"
"5888600","5896540"," I want to pull back and they just watch it just fucking melt up into 2020 five six uh to"
"5896540","5902140"," some like a crazy exuberance I don't know I know some of you know this but some of you probably"
"5902140","5908480"," don't when we were in that tech bubble at the end they were having days like one day wake up"
"5908480","5918120"," and we would be up like three four five six seven percent in a day like straight up so if"
"5918120","5924660"," you get enough people on that trade it's a possibility but it's still a slim possibility it's like"
"5924660","5932080"," the bare thesis uh we're gonna get rake cuts right now uh that we're not gonna end QT we're gonna"
"5932080","5938240"," get rake cuts they're not gonna introduce QE until the bloodbath happens all that shit uh so it's a"
"5938240","5944240"," it's an outlier but it's possible as a point it is it is possible I'll give it to the bulls"
"5944240","5950860"," that they do have a chance of that happening uh it's probably even a better chance it's probably"
"5950860","5959560"," even a better chance than the crash scenario for where we are in a soft landing scenario uh that"
"5959560","5967500"," the bulls could have that so is is it there yeah or is it possible yes it is and I'll"
"5967500","5971760"," give it more to the bulls on I'm gonna give it more to the bulls right now and there's a"
"5971760","5975560"," reason for that okay I'm gonna show you guys something really quick I'm gonna do something cool for"
"5975560","5982560"," you guys hold on one second here I'll show you guys a couple cool things hang tight one second here"
"5982560","5992450"," hold on man hold on one second here I keep a little space heater in my office like my office"
"5992450","5999290"," is uh has HVAC but I keep a little space heater this thing is awesome it like my I can't"
"5999290","6003470"," keep it next to me keeps me all toasty warm and stuff but it's a little too hot right now"
"6003470","6009850"," too hot so I'm going to show you guys a couple things here in this scenario okay what I'm when"
"6009850","6012910"," I'm talking about this scenario we're going to talk about right now so give me just one quick"
"6012910","6022800"," second and here's another fascinating part even my friends like I got friends"
"6022800","6028760"," yeah I'm in this real estate group uh I don't use Facebook but I'm I do use it for two"
"6028760","6034200"," things they use it for marketplace and I use it for a real estate investing group and I use it"
"6034200","6039620"," for burning man I have a burning man a regional group that I'm in and then a real estate group"
"6039620","6044600"," that I'm in and I do I do buy and sell stuff on Facebook from time to time that's all"
"6044600","6051480"," I use Facebook for anymore so on Facebook there's a group of investors okay these guys have been in"
"6051480","6059040"," here with me I've been there I think since 2014 or 13 this group and this group has grown these"
"6059040","6066080"," guys have grown to in amazing ways now these guys are all talking about this cycle end and they're"
"6066080","6075120"," all getting ready to sell into strength into 26 for a roll down into 2028"
"6075120","6084040"," okay and the idea here would be you're in a cycle of buying cheap property and you rent all these"
"6084040","6089640"," properties out Airbnb landlord whatever it is you're doing and then what you do is you unload into"
"6089640","6096120"," this market where this exuberation period comes in you unload into these people and then when this"
"6096120","6101640"," crash actually happens this housing crash actually happens I'm like here here's the house and"
"6101640","6107100"," here's a rental for you it's two hundred thousand dollars you pay for it and then I come back in"
"6107100","6113340"," six months or a year and I find you upside down getting torched right and I come back and buy"
"6113340","6118680"," it back from you for like 100k or something like that does that make sense so we're going to look"
"6118680","6133660"," at that housing cycle really quick there's"
"6133660","6140220"," a nine-year cycle too if you don't already know that I'm going to show you this cycle I'm going"
"6140220","6160690"," to show you an example of this cycle really quick here this"
"6160690","6171220"," is a good one right here I think I"
"6171220","6185490"," have I thought I had this let me see if I got this here somewhere where is that right"
"6185490","6195040"," here not wrong one hold on that isn't it where is it"
"6196680","6206860"," there is that cycle why am I not showing it here where"

"6393910","6401410"," december of 19 get your pens and papers out at home it's snap a screener of this you got a"
"6401410","6410070"," soft landing took place between december of 1965 and september of 1966 that soft landing lasted one"
"6410070","6417930"," year right lasted one year uh say have about a year so when you hear people say things when you're"
"6417930","6424650"," on fin twit right and you hear people talk about uh we might get a soft landing we might get"
"6424650","6430130"," a soft landing we might get a soft landing we might get a soft landing right and then this whole"
"6430130","6435570"," year passes and you're gonna get like someone like Jerome Powell will come out and say something to"
"6435570","6443390"," you like hey to a reporter stop using that soft landing so when you're when you're hearing people"
"6443390","6448670"," ask if there's a soft landing when you hear people on fin twit when you hear people on the news"
"6448670","6457750"," when you hear people on CNBC asking if we are if we actually have a soft landing right uh all"
"6457750","6466030"," this time is passing while they're asking that question this is the soft landing when did it begin"
"6466030","6475050"," for us it began july july 26th i think 26th or 29th i'm wrong i'm wrong in that but it's"
"6475050","6483290"," within a few days july 26th was the last rate increase that we had so if this one right here"
"6483290","6489090"," is a year you come back in july of next year and you'll be still asking if we're in a"
"6489090","6496430"," soft landing and not have traded that entire soft landing now this soft landing right here lasted"
"6496430","6504530"," how long a little bit longer than a year right and this soft landing right here was roughly a year"
"6504530","6511290"," so what can we pause it from history soft landings last on average of one and one and a quarter"
"6511290","6519550"," years we can also pause it at this point that we have not raised rates so we are in the"
"6519550","6526950"," soft landing right now make sense you guys all tracking that but what's the other fascinating part"
"6526950","6534170"," about these numbers here now and that is what there is to get rid of all that get rid of"
"6534170","6541130"," all that what else is we can we pause it from this that in between every soft land or excuse"
"6541130","6550270"," me every without sorry that historically after every soft landing there we are followed by a"
"6550270","6559620"," recession right hundred percent of the time right so we've got a year and a half our year and a"
"6559620","6568500"," quarter average for the actual soft landing historically we follow our recession follows but"
"6568500","6576900"," there's some other thing that's fascinating with this and that is in this period between the soft"
"6576900","6586900"," landing and the recession so the period between this here and this right here and check out the"
"6586900","6595960"," dates there the soft landing ended in 1966 September right and the next recessionary period did not"
"6595960","6602200"," begin here for another year and a half or year and two months on this soft landing right here that"
"6602200","6612040"," ended in August of 84 the next recessionary period did not begin for how long two three"
"6612040","6619080"," years right and then this one right here this is the big boy right here where it ended in February"
"6619080","6628840"," of 1995 and we had a we had an obscene obscene move into the next"
"6628840","6636520"," recessionary period so what is that that's like a window right do you see it now there's a window"
"6636520","6646140"," in between a soft landing in a recession guess who controls that do you know i'll tell you who it"
"6646140","6654620"," is it's the fucking fed in the treasury department there's this moment in here there's a moment in"
"6654620","6664020"," here where the fed fully controls where we go this is the this is the period that i'm taught that"
"6664020","6672300"," i talked to you about where this is the period what a second error where i talk to you about"
"6672300","6679800"," what happens in there and when i talk to you guys about the when i talk to you guys about"
"6679800","6687820"," the largest or excuse me when i talk to you guys about the time where the fed will commit the"
"6687820","6697060"," most broad where they will massage their numbers where they will try to manipulate the yield curve"
"6697060","6704260"," where they will fudge the inflation numbers where they'll fudge the jobs numbers where they'll"
"6704260","6713080"," fudge the unemployment numbers the velocity in this stuff is actually in the period leading up to"
"6713080","6719420"," that window during that soft landing the end of that soft landing and into that window phase of the"
"6719420","6726300"," stock market now you can go back and clip that stuff and at home i want you to snap some"
"6726300","6733980"," vertical lines on your own charts do some homework over the weekend snap some vertical lines where"
"6733980","6741020"," those periods are the snap a line on the start and end of a soft landing snap another line on"
"6741020","6745560"," the beginning and end of the recessionary period and then i want you to see what the performance"
"6745560","6754700"," was during the soft landing and then that window and here's the fascinating part i also want you to"
"6754700","6762820"," put on a chart at home i want you to compare that to inflation unemployment and the fed funds rate"
"6762820","6772540"," when you compare the rate of inflation the unemployment rate the fed funds rate against those"
"6772540","6782200"," periods right it's fascinating what it shows you now that doesn't mean this happens"
"6782200","6792040"," this time but if we're looking back on historical examples pre-prior examples we have some"
"6792040","6801340"," potential for not only a bull run this year but it being up to the fed how long that extends"
"6801340","6812180"," in that window so if we can pause it right now that the soft landing began in late july right"
"6812180","6821880"," of 2023 it should last until when at least one year right or at least historically"
"6822700","6832620"," into july possibly even the end of the year of 2024 we also"
"6832620","6842580"," can pause it that the next recessionary period does not begin right away right we"
"6842580","6847000"," have three examples year and a half i think it was year in two months uh two or three years"
"6847000","6860040"," and then five years now knowing those things knowing that a housing cycle is ending this market"
"6860040","6870690"," can go up and not only can it go up they can have some obscene upside moods so when"
"6870690","6875510"," you're out there being a bear and you're like uh you know we're going to crash uh fucking february"
"6875510","6886830"," fucking 15th or it's january 15th or march 15th uh i i'm not anti that but"
"6886830","6896550"," historically you might be waiting a little longer than you anticipate you might be waiting until a"
"6896550","6906550"," minimum october december of this year possibly 2026 january"
"6906550","6916330"," and maybe even longer 2830 no i don't think you're going to last that long as a bull"
"6916330","6925910"," that's the the way outside of the curve thing but you know when when you're hearing this stuff in"
"6925910","6934710"," on cnbc on bloomberg on thin twit or whatever uh i i don't know i i think i'm agreeing i'm"
"6934710","6939870"," in agreement with this stuff i'm like yeah i get it yeah i get that i understand this yep got"
"6939870","6946270"," it that's a little uh archaic but i think i got it but that guy over there is not committed"
"6946270","6951050"," to any of this shit but uh he's he's definitely dropping that shit in public right he must be a"
"6951050","6956190"," reporter or wanting a job as a reporter or some the other guys must have ome or something some of"
"6956190","6960530"," the guys probably just fucking record our repeating shit that he's picking up on the news and"
"6960530","6965230"," sounding like it's a smart guy but does that have anything to do with the cash market probably not"
"6965230","6973430"," or at least historically it doesn't so"
"6973430","6983210"," uh from prior historical examples um we probably got at least another year and here's the fucked up"
"6983210","6992070"," part uh of course we're all watching uh the consumer right bob on main street"
"6992070","7000770"," right is like mary with the landscape in business and uh joe donut and i are watching credit card"
"7000770","7008430"," debt right we're watching bad debt with high rates right people are just high rates high rates bad"
"7008430","7016130"," debt that just a cummer mary the landscaper right now is with an a high rate environment is taking"
"7016130","7025550"," on crazy fucking debt with high rates 20 30 percent but guess what i found out guess what i found"
"7025550","7033430"," out they can't they're debt to income ratio right they're they're debt to income ratio they're bad"
"7033430","7042950"," credit all that shit they can't refi with a hellock they can't refi to a low interest consolidation"
"7042950","7049690"," package of that bad debt and this ain't good debt this ain't the debt that uh like i buy a"
"7049690","7055570"," house and my house is going up 10 percent every year kind of debt where that's good debt right"
"7055570","7060830"," appreciating assets this is these are people that are spending fucking credit card money it's 20"
"7060830","7067070"," percent 30 percent and they're like what am i i'm going to go zero percent for myself think they"
"7067070","7073050"," can't but guess what they are doing they're refinancing their house is enrolling that dog shit debt"
"7073050","7081370"," into this these uh new pet repackaged loans now they're debts at uh eight percent nine percent so"
"7081370","7086210"," it's better than 20 or 30 but it's still eight or nine so they what what does that mean it"
"7086210","7095050"," means they bought themselves some fucking time so yes mary the landscapers fucked but she was also"
"7095050","7103670"," given a lifeline she was also given a lifeline for a little bit more time which is gross so if"
"7103670","7111890"," you're a bear yeah you're right but they were just extended right now so when they weren't so when"
"7111890","7116270"," these mortgage writers when they write mortgages they couldn't because the rates were high or the"
"7116270","7123110"," or the impression that rates were high was out there no one's selling no one's buying rates already"
"7123110","7129550"," nine percent all that kind of stuff right okay so they're not buying what are they doing they're"
"7129550","7134230"," taking the shit debt and they're putting it into this other shit debt that's still shit debt just"
"7134230","7142170"," repackaged it bought them some more time so is the consumer fucked probably not GDP still going up"

"7478760","7486240"," we're at one of those tops so that Ford PE was at like 20 30 47 insane 50 60 it's"

"7507680","7516200"," let's buy 4200 it's probably down there isn't it somewhere on that line isn't it so i have wishful"
"7516200","7523100"," thinking for 4200 we've already traded the market sideways for how many years we actually started"
"7523100","7532840"," cutting the legs off the markets in December of 2020 December of 2020 we were cutting spec growth"
"7532840","7542700"," we worked our way through the entire market from then until October and even some more now right we"
"7542700","7551220"," finally cut the legs off of regional banks in 23 right they've been underneath the surface coming"
"7551220","7560760"," back that whole entire covid trade under the surface then they came out for the um debt for the uh"
"7560760","7569100"," debt the debt bonds on uh the blue chips right they finally took those out and so what are we"
"7569100","7573220"," ramping for or what are we doing all this for right right here the past three years right two years"
"7573220","7582580"," three years for one more run up they bought the fucking dip in October of 23 they bought the dip"
"7585360","7594180"," underneath the surface of the market the big bad boys the ultra wealthy they bought that fucking"
"7594180","7601760"," dip in October if you were able to catch another one of those dips in March or June they're likely"
"7601760","7608980"," still fucking long and they likely know about the soft landing period they likely know about the"
"7608980","7615520"," window before the next recessionary period they likely know about the housing cycle and what do"
"7615520","7624920"," they want do you know what they want they want that one last cocaine field run"
"7624920","7634880"," that one last ramp they want it they want it they want it they've had it they've had it they've"
"7634880","7642320"," had it since 1978 you can literally see how they get every one of those short-term debt cycles they"
"7642320","7650580"," ramp that end of it right the market makers are all happy right they sold all this oh they bought"
"7650580","7656180"," they sold all this shit when it was really low and they want that one payment at the top so"
"7660120","7666800"," no matter what you're hearing in the news more than likely these guys want a fucking party one more"
"7666800","7676740"," time and they haven't party yet i'm sorry the 4800 and that's not their party their party is"
"7676740","7685560"," higher so is there a chance of us trading 6 000 fast fuck yes absolutely absolutely"

"7696760","7703540"," you can see it easy is easy peasy you can see it they're fucking long in that trade that ain't"
"7703540","7712960"," you and i it's not me i don't have 60 million dollars 4 billion dollars 10 billion"

"7731510","7740850"," all know what they do you stand back you gawk as it happens you're too scared to take to buy"
"7740850","7749150"," it right i'm just waiting for a pullback and it blasts up there and then eventually you jump in at"
"7749150","7753610"," the top eventually right that happens all the time we know it happens with investors sideline money"
"7753610","7760850"," bob on main street you guys remember 2000 and 2008 everybody had a fucking take on the market the"
"7760850","7768330"," guys your shoe shiner remember that one that was from 1930s right remember that story my shoe"
"7768330","7773810"," shiner knew more about the market than i did i knew that was the top same shit happened in no"
"7773810","7781470"," in 2000 2001 same thing happened in 07 and 08 so before that happens is what we're talking about"
"7781470","7789050"," right we're talking before that we get there and so you hear doom gloom this that's right markets"
"7789050","7798250"," done for and the store the story they're telling doesn't really match any historical example it"

"8040770","8047350"," we'll keep we keep watching it keep watching it you're gonna flips down here your s1's down here"
"8047350","8054430"," bulls do not want to lose this for the environment right now you want to be buying the gamma flip"
"8054430","8065930"," and selling the call wall to the upside up here okay that's what you're looking to do so"
"8065930","8074830"," you're a dumb money trader you're you're a cash market trader the regime right now is sell this by"

"8158120","8166340"," eight hundred you get all like we're on the next level no you need on this side to reject and"

"8358680","8386750"," down brother good question legend thanks for asking well you"
"8386750","8391990"," know what that means right legend we likely sell into that earnings don't we if you're you know"
"8391990","8396250"," your test of your test trader you're selling we're either we're either ramping into earnings on"
"8396250","8402170"," Tesla we're selling into earnings right and then you wait like a week after that's the same with ba"
"8402170","8409070"," right you wait and you like you get you trap like trap put or call holders doesn't matter you wait"
"8409070","8415550"," until the first major expiry when someone's trapped a bull or bear once the once do you wipe out"
"8415550","8421150"," all those all those calls or puts then they ramp it back up or ramp it down so you could"
"8421150","8426970"," be looking at what not not necessarily but generally speaking if you're selling into an er then you"
"8426970","8431710"," get that one little capitulation after the er and they come back after that expiry wash out all the"
"8431710","8435770"," speculators and then they bring it back up or they bring or they roll it down one of the other"
"8435770","8441370"," if you ramp up into one of these decimal things you know we sell usually right sell the er sell"
"8441370","8476740"," the news yeah"
"8476740","8482960"," we need minus 25 trust me I was I was talking to Joe last night and I'm like Joe I'm"
"8482960","8487940"," like I want you to look at every single bull run in Tesla go back in history every single one"
"8487940","8494300"," there's no example of us not going back down like going to zero below on daily on tesla and then"
"8494300","8498680"," like ramping back up again every time we do that because of that cycle we hit the daily low on"
"8498680","8506400"," the bellow every single time Hey legend thanks for gifting a tier one subscription brother"
"8508980","8584140"," appreciate that man appreciate that brother yeah"
"8584140","8590660"," what am I hiding uh it is on purpose so the reason that the bellow is here is because we're"
"8590660","8597060"," on a one-minute chart and I do not trust may I kind of trust the bellow on a day"
"8597060","8602960"," trading chart but I tend to place my trades on a 30-minute chart that's why I switch back and"
"8602960","8607840"," forth if you guys want me to move it I will I can move it hold on we can move"
"8607840","8614220"," that hold on one second here let me one second you know what I'll do is I'll I'll reef I'll"
"8614220","8620200"," resize this tomorrow for you I cover it or I cover it down here because I don't want you guys"
"8620200","8624380"," to uh but if you guys want to do that we can do that is that better for you does"
"8624380","8631800"," that help you want to see that bellow but you can you can use this bellow on a one-minute"
"8633600","8642220"," uh it works on a day trading basis you want to see it then it works on a day trading"
"8642220","8647300"," you can actually see the roll right there so you guys can't see that right now you can actually see"
"8647300","8657160"," the roll down here but it's cleaner on the indexes specifically on a half-hour basis yeah"
"8657160","8667160"," we'll leave it up for you I personally even so"
"8667160","8671680"," like I trade the one-minute chart sorry trade the one-minute chart with the triggers but I always"
"8671680","8675860"," constantly go back and watch the 30 minutes because I'm looking for the bigger cycle looking for"
"8675860","8682440"," that I'm looking at day trade bullish on a one-minute basis but using a 30-minute time frame"
"8682440","8714340"," velocity that I can leave it up for you it does work yeah"
"8714340","8717840"," I can move it I moved it for you it's not it's move it's below the time and the velocity"
"8717840","8724100"," man it works it's not it's not as clean especially on an index it's not as clean the cleanest I"
"8724100","8729780"," find on the indexes for uh in this and the velocity and 30 day and the 30-minute velocity I"
"8729780","8736420"," like let's talk about much stuff here so and I've got a trading program in this but now you can"
"8736420","8743980"," use the velocity on a one-minute basis if you're a futures trader it works really well a zero-date"
"8743980","8752020"," trader one-date trader not as well not as clean so what I'm looking for for me personally is a"
"8752020","8760320"," 30-minute velocity on a one-minute chart and then I'm looking for that I'm looking for that like uh"
"8760320","8766680"," like I'm looking for some trump cards on my side if you're playing like Wist or something like a"
"8766680","8770620"," card game or something like that where you have some uh Chicago or not Chicago what's the other one"
"8770620","8777040"," people play spades they have trump cards I want that extra little oomph in the back back end to"
"8777040","8784100"," validate that trade higher or lower doesn't matter so I personally like 30-minute time frame now"
"8784100","8788500"," there's other time frames too if you got like a one-day time frame and start looking at um"
"8788500","8798480"," monthlies quarterlies six month uh fractals and and velocity you can see um you can"
"8798480","8803660"," actually time market crashes we'll go into that we've talked about that on the show in the past but"
"8803660","8811600"," probably need to talk more what you can see historically on higher time frames uh and with a lot"
"8811600","8815520"," mostly with velocity well it triggers and velocity"
"8815520","8823560"," at a going down"
"8823560","8833440"," in a divergence created in price uh in price versus velocity on higher time frames like a"
"8833440","8841600"," monthly quarterly six months so you see like velocity dropping off those higher time frames and"
"8841600","8846480"," price going higher when you when that divergent starts you know you're at a major top in the market"
"8846480","8852960"," you actually predict a crash and the other cool part on those higher time frames is you can predict"
"8852960","8866520"," the targets on the triggers to the downside which is really cool that is"
"8866520","8873380"," the magic sauce that is the magic sauce that's the that's the freaky shit right there and actually"
"8873380","8879200"," like if we had a crash you could you could give like three targets and say this one this one"
"8879200","8882540"," this one we're going to hit one of these three right here and each time we hit one of them"
"8882540","8888640"," we'll know to close and then look for the roll down for the next target you can actually uh give"
"8888640","8893320"," those projections what's really fascinating too is when you give those or what's really fascinating"
"8893320","8899520"," about it is that when a guy like uh mike wilson comes out and he gives the target like when"
"8899520","8908560"," he gets all bared up and he's like our downside our downside expectation for uh the next quarter is"
"8908560","8915120"," whatever number it is it falls right in line right in line with where those targets are so they're"
"8915120","8920340"," they're the same people looking at that same shit they're using those same targets that we're using"
"8920340","8946770"," here comes"
"8946770","8956680"," the blood baby come on give me that just give me that blood down here be like friday blood i'm"

"9173460","9179000"," SPG now you know what how about this i'm going to do it in the background that i'll switch over"
"9179000","9184100"," to a different screen and i'll set it all up for you because often it takes away from what's"
"9184100","9190900"," happening right now so what i'll do is in the background i will do that okay so give me two"
"9190900","9195460"," seconds i'm gonna turn on the uh CNBC and i'll work on that chart for you is that work cool"
"9195460","9200820"," and jim labenfall but first let's get a check in the markets at noon eastern uh the down down right"
"9200820","9205800"," now about a half a percent pulling back from its record high the S&P we are on record close"
"9205800","9211220"," watch right now the number to watch is $47.97 but as you can see it is fractionally lower than"
"9211220","9216700"," NASDAQ uh moving to the downside looking like it could break it's winning watch out here boys and"
"9216700","9222660"," girls 10-year treasury right now back below 4 percent at 3.95 something we continue to watch after"
"9222660","9227800"," that cooler than expected PPI report we'll talk much more about that later but our focus right now"
"9227800","9232740"," is on earnings and on the banks uh best place to start i think might be JP Morgan's broad ownership"
"9232740","9237760"," here joe i'm going to start with you uh record full-year earnings record for your revenue"
"9237760","9242540"," investment banking revenue up 3 percent year over year what was your take my take is there's JP"
"9242540","9246300"," Morgan and then there's the rest of the banks and that's the story that is the way it has been"
"9246300","9253300"," for the better part of the last 12 months it's the reason why i own JP Morgan the JOT ETF"
"9253300","9258360"," we've been underweight financials for the last year it is so disappointing to see what the other"
"9258360","9264260"," banks are reporting relative to the strength that JP Morgan is reporting seven consecutive quarters"
"9264260","9272320"," of record net interest income and there was no conversation about net interest income declining at"
"9272320","9277540"," JP Morgan like there was at Wells Fargo Wells Fargo said net interest income could be down nine"
"9277540","9284620"," percent in the coming year while Wells Fargo's expenses rise so disappointing for all the other"
"9284620","9290820"," banks i'm a little bit surprised at city i thought the near-term momentum that city had i thought"
"9290820","9296220"," in fact you'd see some buying demand surface you're not seeing that basically if you're stepping in"
"9296220","9302200"," and buying city you're believing that CEO jane frasier's comments about 24 being a turnaround story"
"9302200","9308540"," that that in fact could be correct but Bank of America trading revenue declines for fixed income 5 "
"9308540","9314000",".8 percent these other money center banks are just not delivering what JP Morgan is delivering on"
"9314000","9317380"," yeah i think you might have a city group believer down there on the other as a desk but i'm"
"9317380","9321180"," going to talk about JP Morgan a little bit longer with Brenda what was your take on the quarter and"
"9321180","9325660"," also the comments from Jamie diamond kind of on one hand saying the economy strong on the other"
"9325660","9332120"," hand really spelling out a lot of geopolitical issues and macro issues well i think on jimmy had"
"9332120","9337800"," jimmy diamonds comments it's not unlike what we've heard from him over and over again where he's"
"9337800","9344000"," expressed concern over various components of a macro environment or geopolitical environment but"
"9344000","9347900"," when we look at the results from the bank we look at the results about in his commentary about the"
"9347900","9352340"," consumer they continue to be positive i mean one thing we also heard on the conference calls that"
"9352340","9357560"," they're seeing the consumer normalize in their words and you know that means there's not as much"
"9357560","9363080"," excess savings there but the consumer is still healthy but i think that's something to keep an eye"
"9363080","9368780"," on because that's going to flow through to overall consumer spending and we'll see if we're able to"
"9368780","9373500"," keep up with a year like we had last year where consumers really did spend a lot on things like"
"9373500","9380220"," travel but i think overall we are pleased with the quarter pleased with the commentary but not"
"9380220","9385840"," surprising to hear Jamie diamonds you know cautious comments because we've heard that over and over"
"9385840","9390620"," again what did you make of jp morgan and all fairness bank of america as well saying if not for"
"9390620","9396500"," that fdic special fee our results would have been this is that meaningful to you as an investor i"
"9396500","9403300"," think it was you know it's it's part of business in the current environment it's known and you know"
"9403300","9408140"," it's a you know a function of the banking crisis that we had early early last year so i think"
"9408140","9414180"," we can move on and and move forward and and so if not not terribly surprising and certainly doesn't"
"9414180","9419640"," change our view of jp morgan although say that is our only exposure to banks is jp morgan so jim"
"9419640","9426160"," you own jp morgan you also own city group revenue miss eps of 84 cents sign and clear if that's"
"9426160","9430800"," comparable to estimates in september jane frasier said she's reorganizing now we know it's at least"
"9430800","9436580"," 20 000 layoffs billion dollar charge related to severances my my good friend houston from cmbc.com"
"9436580","9442980"," litany of charges yeah but it frankly expected and when i say expected why do i say that it's"
"9442980","9448780"," because the stock trades at a 60 discount excuse me 40 discount to tangible book value so the"
"9448780","9453640"," street already understands that whatever book value is it's got to get knocked down by charges and"
"9453640","9457880"," frankly in that scheme of things the size of the charges that we're talking about are actually"
"9457880","9463860"," minuscule okay so that if you actually got city group up to tangible book value you would see"
"9463860","9468800"," something like a 30 percent share appreciation from here maybe 40 percent you know joe i hear what"
"9468800","9473800"," you're saying and i don't argue against it about jp morgan versus everyone else for a few months"
"9473800","9477980"," now i've tried to recharacterize this i don't want to say for a second that city group is competing"
"9477980","9482200"," with jp morgan they're light years apart i mean you go look at the wealth management business you"
"9482200","9486200"," can look at the investment banking business city groups a different story it's a restructuring"
"9486200","9492880"," story and let's face it this is a restructuring that has been overdue by almost 25 years going back"
"9492880","9498240"," to when sandy wile built this behemoth and it got way out of hand jane frasier is the first person"
"9498240","9503060"," who has actually taken a scalpel or maybe it's a machete to getting this bank to the right size"
"9503060","9507920"," she's taken a lot of steps in that regard i think she's making great progress and for city group"
"9507920","9512900"," what you're really looking for here is where are expenses headed they're headed down that's in the"
"9512900","9517700"," guidance was the quarter great no the quarter was bad and had all the sort of charges but the year"
"9517700","9522600"," ahead you're looking at expenses coming down and that's what investors in city group want to see it"
"9522600","9528780"," so are you buying are you buying city group for the turnaround story which evolves over the course"
"9528780","9534280"," of 2024 are you buying city group because you believe the turnaround is something that's going to"
"9534280","9539180"," be sustainable and you could own this the way you could own jp morgan for multiple years yeah again"
"9539180","9543300"," i don't want to make the comparison to jp morgan we're just we're just talking about light years"
"9543300","9548040"," definitely on a time you're thinking through ownership time i do think it's sustainable to answer"
"9548040","9551940"," your question right these are permanent expense cuts just the way they by the way some of the"
"9551940","9556160"," charges right we're international charges because they're shutting down operations in places like"
"9556160","9560960"," russia in the next year here and a half they're going to spin out the banamax operation these are"
"9560960","9565680"," things that do take time but once you do something like spin out the banamax operation you're not"
"9565680","9570460"," going to bring it back in so it is sustainable and the key here joe just a the key here"
"9570460","9575200"," is tangible book value you're treating it 60 percent of tangible book value that's too low but if"
"9575200","9580920"," you're getting leaner as a company is there enough revenue growth from the business because yes"
"9580920","9585420"," just think about this one second i was surprised to know this city group shuts its meanie business"
"9585420","9590280"," city group shuts its distress debt business yeah i know you don't want to make the comparison to jp"
"9590280","9595400"," morgan but as an example jp morgan's actually investing in those businesses so on the other side of"
"9595400","9600180"," all leaner city is there enough growth yeah no this is a great question so in addition to not"
"9600180","9604680"," comparing the two you got to know what city groups focus is it's on cash management it's on"
"9604680","9610560"," treasury solutions for corporations it's on security servicing it's not on doing investment banking"
"9610560","9615240"," and advising one company over acquiring the other and look the muni business and i know this for my"
"9615240","9621260"," family history has been tough for decades it has been tough for decades so it seems like the"
"9621260","9625060"," underlying question here is do you believe in jane frasier's leadership we'll have to wait and see"
"9625060","9629140"," uh city shares in the red right now but jenny i want to come over to you uncharacteristically quiet"
"9629140","9632780"," i know you don't own any of these big banks uh but what did you make up this kind of"
"9632780","9638420"," noisy start to earning season one big i want to ask you about bank of america big consumer bank uh"
"9638420","9643280"," they said net interest income decreased by five percent due to higher deposit cost and lower"
"9643280","9648120"," deposit balances what does that say to you so i'm thinking two things listening to this one the"
"9648120","9652300"," reason i was so excited to start to hear the bank's earnings is thinking about what they're going"
"9652300","9656980"," to tell us about the consumer and the health of the consumer and it's interesting too because as"
"9656980","9660900"," we've been talking about the consumer i keep thinking that there's there's different consumers out"
"9660900","9665560"," there right there's like the high end consumer and they're doing fine there's all there's lower end"
"9665560","9669880"," like we need to be real it's bifurcated so that's why you see things like american express holding"
"9669880","9675800"," up 30-day loan delinquencies they're like really low things like discover much higher and i think"
"9675800","9680060"," it's interesting listening you all talk about jp morgan versus city i know we haven't talked much"
"9680060","9684380"," about wells yet but there's big differences in the in the customers of those banks and in the"
"9684380","9689240"," prospects of those banks so what i'm really listening for are things like layoffs because you know"
"9689240","9693840"," what layoffs however you cut it are kind of bad for society they're bad for the unemployment rate"
"9693840","9700000"," they're bad for american for american you know consumers so i'm looking for those i'm looking at to"
"9700000","9704740"," your point exactly you know the decrease in net interest income why is that happening it's because"
"9704740","9709300"," like there's weakness out there so i think it's very insightful from a macro perspective but then"
"9709820","9713900"," there's another broader thing too which is how are these earnings get how are we getting to these"
"9713900","9718460"," earnings because again don't forget we're just in fourth quarter and so fine if they made their"
"9718460","9724040"," numbers that means 2023s s&p earnings are kind of signed sealed and delivered but what the outlook"
"9724040","9730380"," is is really important and so when we see decreases at nii and we think all right well to get"
"9730380","9737540"," to analyst expectations for 2024 we need s&p earnings to grow by about 12 percent this is very"
"9737540","9742680"," insightful because what they're saying so far is like yeah we made earnings but there's not so much"
"9742680","9747400"," growth ahead and so i think that worries me a little bit as we think out to the year ahead"
"9747400","9751760"," can we really get that 12 percent growth that we need you know or is it going to be lost"
"9751760","9756700"," i think that we will grow off of 2023s earnings collectively not just banking but i don't think"
"9756700","9759820"," we're going to get to that 12 percent i think it'll be interesting to see where we end up so"
"9759820","9764040"," i'm looking at this as much more of a macro insight than individual bank you know hard to believe"
"9764040","9767500"," we didn't even talk about Wells Fargo really those shares down three and a half percent but we're"
"9767500","9771520"," going to hear a lot more about the big banks next week the CEO is a bank of america jp"

"9803040","9809120"," perhaps as soon as March the producer price index came in below expectations at minus zero i mean"
"9809120","9814040"," that blood baby inflationary pressure up the supply that's so in blood here prompting economists to"

"10072990","10077990"," know if if the fed doesn't want that cut in march i think you were saying that that chair Powell"
"10077990","10083930"," at a press conference will will walk it back and i don't know in january but don't you expect that"
"10083930","10089270"," next week you'll get some fed speakers saying hey guys no no no no 81% is not where we're"
"10089270","10093930"," going here or we in the blackout period i mean i think the feds if they don't want to cut"
"10093930","10099630"," march they got to put this out there right now i don't i don't think they have to i think"
"10099630","10105010"," that i think the fed is happy for the market to price something three months ahead of time i think"
"10105010","10109690"," what the fed cares about is where expectations are going into the particular meeting where the cut"
"10109690","10116090"," is expected and what i'm suggesting jim is that you know the the world today is not the world that"
"10116090","10121070"," we're going to have going into the march meeting and if you suppose and it's a big suppose and a"
"10121070","10127050"," big if there that if you have these kind of inflation numbers going into that march meeting it's"
"10127050","10132230"," going to be hard for the fed not to acknowledge that cuts are imminent remember if you think of it"
"10132230","10141010"," as a two and a half percent nominal or sorry long-term funds rate the fed is really really tight"
"10141010","10146670"," here relative to the underlying inflation rate and joe the reason it matters is not for guys"
"10146670","10153990"," necessarily in the stock market it's the folks doing the financing that care that's basic uh just"

"10343940","10348300"," target raised by truest i know you're overweight more broadly when it comes to megacap techniques"
"10348300","10353720"," yes we're not over overweight all the megacap tech names we're picky and where we have our"
"10353720","10357640"," overweights but i will say if we look at the fundamentals and their contributions to earnings"
"10357640","10362660"," growth it's pretty phenomenal especially in the fourth quarter not to be really short term about it"
"10362660","10367500"," but if we look at fourth quarter earnings estimates if we strip out the megacap eight stocks"
"10367500","10373020"," earnings expectations are actually for a negative year-over-year growth rate for the q4 so i think"
"10373020","10378340"," that's right i agree with that too that these and stocks are really huge contributors to overall"
"10378340","10384940"," earnings growth and i think that's important also many of them are tied to the the evolution of ai"
"10384940","10391760"," which is important we can't ignore it but that is a new wave of innovation coming our way and so"
"10391760","10395880"," i do think it's important to have some exposure but i do agree with Jim that i think we are"
"10395880","10400980"," going to continue to see a broadening of participation in the market especially from areas like"
"10400980","10407260"," small and midcap but i think we can't ignore the the strength of tech and the need to in our"
"10407260","10412860"," view continue to have some exposure to that part of the market if we think"
"10412860","10423240"," about"
"10423240","10427120"," their actual businesses and the role that those businesses play not just in the u.s but globally"
"10427120","10432040"," like from that business perspective they'll maintain our leadership for the rest of you know our"
"10432040","10437800"," natural lives from the stock market leadership i think it's impossible for me to make any case"
"10437800","10443460"," where they would where they would maintain and this is a really important to us the magnitude of"
"10443460","10447460"," their performance leadership that they've shot in the past and so Steve and i were getting into it"
"10447460","10451540"," last week right because he was talking about microsoft and like you know it could kind of plateau"
"10451540","10456820"," in my opinion what do you think is behind it what do you really think microsoft could return next"
"10456820","10460100"," year and he's like it should be at the market or better and i was like you know what fair"
"10460100","10463560"," enough i'm not going to keep arguing with you on that and so i think as we think about the"
"10463560","10469960"," mag seven overall or the mag eight i think that's probably how we should reframe and think okay you"
"10469960","10473900"," know it's not likely that they're going to be up 62 percent again this year like they were last"
"10473900","10477560"," year but if they perform kind of in line with the market that's great and there's a really"
"10477560","10481380"," important thing to think about here too which i bump into with a lot of my clients so well you"
"10481380","10486360"," all know i don't own any of these except for except for um meta in our just one growth strategy"
"10486360","10493620"," we have tons of clients who have very large positions in microsoft apple google amazon why because"
"10493620","10498060"," they've owned them for years when they moved their accounts over to gillman hill they have like"
"10498060","10503800"," zero cost spaces so if you're thinking about selling microsoft or google or amazon and you've got"
"10503800","10508320"," say like a million dollars worth of these stocks which people do and the cost space is essentially"
"10508320","10513400"," zero you need to say to sell that stock i need to expect it to go down by 23.8"
"10513400","10517660"," because that's what the capital grains tax rate would be at that point and so that puts this"
"10517660","10523300"," incredible foundational floor under the continued ownership of these for a long time so when we"
"10523300","10528280"," think about them going forward it would be very very hard to envision a mass sell off but at the"
"10528280","10532380"," same time when we think about our portfolio the thing i used for my final trade last week was"
"10532380","10538540"," active right a small cap company that sorry mid kind of small cap company that's make they make um"
"10538540","10544840"," the harnesses for wires for EVs right but it trades at 14 times earnings with 25 percent earnings"
"10544840","10549240"," growth ahead it's hard for me to imagine that that doesn't have performance leadership in the"
"10549240","10554300"," coming year so that's where i'm struggling like mag seven can be fine it's probably stupid to sell"
"10554300","10560300"," them if you have huge capital gains but the magnitude of leadership on a performance basis i can't"
"10560300","10563840"," get to anything that would justify it Joe i know you on microsoft you're saying don't move too far"
"10563840","10568860"," away from these mega cap names you got to keep moving on the show though everyone has it has a"
"10568860","10573480"," specific discipline i run an equally weighted strategy we're all looking for a broadening out of"
"10573480","10577640"," the market but you have to acknowledge it has not happened so far year to date and it's a reason"
"10577640","10582480"," why the market is so choppy allowing the algos to be in control all right coming up next here on"
"10582480","10587260"," half we're hitting more of today's big movers that includes delta united health and docuassign we"
"10587260","10759860"," got ownership in all of these names we debate those trades half-time back in just two minutes down"
"10759860","10764320"," 200 points welcome back to half-time report let's hit some committee stocks that are on the move"
"10764320","10769040"," we're starting with delta airline shares lower despite beating on earnings the company going"
"10769040","10774560"," guidance for the year Jim you just added delta earlier this week yeah this um share price movement"
"10774560","10780960"," is absolutely a head fake it is an outsized response that i expect to be reversed and here's why"
"10780960","10787040"," first off free cash flow last year two billion they're guiding to three and a half billion at the"
"10787040","10792000"," midpoint for this year so three and a half billion that's you know pretty sizable 75 percent"

"17233450","17237150"," seen here to start the year Is the market has kind of retracted a little bit?"
"17237870","17242290"," Is that a co not collapsing but a deflating a little bit of evaluation?"
"17243310","17245150"," No, because I think we're most of that P."
"17245290","17250430"," Expanded again It was really concentrated in the markets to just really your big tech firms right a"
"17250430","17254170"," lot of the other areas are actually still under value Like the energy for example trades like 11"
"17254170","17255190"," time forward earnings."
"17255290","17255670"," Thanks. "
"17255870","17259370"," Yeah by far the cheapest out there right now And I think there's a lot of opportunities and"
"17259370","17264770"," investors can look at where they you don't have these largely stretched valuation So I do think"
"17264770","17269570"," investors should still own your apples and your googles your Microsoft in your videos But I think"
"17269570","17273450"," there's a lot of other areas that are cheap evaluations You can consistently add money to maybe"
"17273450","17278110"," even take profits and be be rotating out into you know It's interesting I'll tell you about that if"
"17278110","17282490"," you look at the way that it Moved in the children in terms of the market in the last half"
"17282490","17287270"," of the year a lot of that multiple expansion that we talked about was because of these Lower"
"17287270","17292330"," interest rates as people either saw interest rates go lower or have the expectation that the Fed"
"17292330","17296750"," was going to cut as soon As March that played into the multiple discussion, which is why you can"
"17296750","17303610"," justify higher multiples What if that gets derailed is there actual multiple contraction this year"
"17303610","17309070"," if interest rate don't play along or is there something that has multiples moving independent of"
"17309070","17314050"," what that narrative around interest rates So I actually wonder though if that was as much of a play"
"17314050","17319010"," into some of the multiple expansion as was is all of the speculation of artificial intelligence and"
"17319010","17323030"," What that's going to lead to in future earnings and that is where I think some of that's going to"
"17323030","17327130"," come in I think you're already starting to see that where suddenly everyone is so excited about"
"17327130","17330750"," what this is going to do to Productivity in the future and I think there's something to that but"
"17330750","17334070"," now with this year They're saying okay, how much is that actually going to affect earnings here in"
"17334070","17334650"," the short term?"
"17335230","17339850"," I think that was actually a bigger effect to a lot of the earnings multiples the nature it's coming"
"17339850","17342630"," down Which I don't think has been fully realized yet, and I think that's what we're going to start"
"17342630","17347530"," to see here You mentioned banks being really Remarkably cheap at this point, but let's talk a"
"17347530","17352590"," little bit about that and whether you see that as a sector that is Highly investable moderately"
"17352590","17357010"," investable and and of course we're going to have Brian Moynihan on here in just a moment So if"
"17357010","17361310"," you've got any thoughts on Bank of America now's the time Yeah, it gives me fascinating the year"
"17361310","17364690"," already has to say and I think especially what they're saying on the consumer, right?"
"17364850","17370450"," everybody really looks to JP Morgan when Jamie diamond reports there and so far they really haven't"
"17370450","17374510"," seen the issues with the consumers that a lot of people were expecting to see I mean generally"
"17374510","17379510"," they're still in good shape and bank earnings maybe have actually not hit their expectations But a"
"17379510","17381430"," lot of those were for some one-time cars."
"17381430","17385890"," They're charging us exactly I'm the ones today strip those out and actually a lot of them beat"
"17385890","17389350"," expectations So I don't think this is necessary as much of a concern as people should be worried"
"17389350","17393570"," about Especially interest rates start to come down this year We actually could start to see lending"
"17393570","17396790"," activity pick up which could help the banks I think that's gonna be interesting You know there's"
"17396790","17401590"," been so much of a discussion about and rightfully so because these mega banks are the focal point"
"17401590","17406090"," of kicking off earnings season But we you know it was maybe just a little over a year ago that"
"17406090","17411330"," we saw the Silicon Valley Bank signature bank issues the smaller regional Banks in America got all"
"17411330","17417750"," of the attention Is it perhaps an opportunity now to revisit that smaller mid-sized bank trade and"

"18195790","18200710"," reposition and renegotiate the next leg up if it resolves to the upside Does that make sense?"
"18200950","18205270"," You'd have to like break this previous high right here Come back down and then boom you're off and"
"18205270","18211030"," running again right there to the upside Makes sense and you can do that three times one two three."

"18869450","18874350"," think what's interesting with the setup for banks, right is that you know, we do have a slowdown in"
"18874350","18881230"," economy But you know The the push and pull of this quarter and earnings is if we are still thinking"
"18881230","18886450"," about a soft landing You know, the forward curve doesn't really make a lot of sense with six cuts"
"18886990","18893230"," So I think we're getting some you know more severe Nii guys and maybe it might be reality as we've"

"19002810","19009110"," stock that Will likely outperform its peers In more of a stress situation."
"19009450","19015050"," So to brian's point they can hold on to nii a little bit better in a in a You know,"
"19015230","19018170"," six cut environment Part of it's because of deposit growth. "
"19018170","19022750"," The other part of it is because of a higher beta on its liabilities But I also think with bank"
"19022750","19029630"," of america where we get more constructive as we think Um, there's a safer play on credit So if the"
"19029630","19034630"," economy turns a little bit more challenging, we think they would outperform on the credit side"

"20145690","20152150"," Now on book map we have some weakness here and we also have more lows It looks like showing itself"
"20152150","20158870"," to the downside and I am long calls here on zero dates on the day So my thesis is not"
"20158870","20162870"," working out and I never took well it did work out, but I didn't take the money and run So"
"20162870","20168270"," i'm caught down there I'm gonna likely have to try to DCA into this close above now."
"20168330","20175090"," I'm going to switch over here To let me switch over this one quick thing right here We're going to"
"20175090","20179110"," switch over to a couple things here Let me see and bring this up. "
"20179290","20182270"," Okay, so we're going to look at my screener here."
"20182310","20192330"," I think Cap screen, okay, so here's a seasonality chart for 2020 24 So"
"20192330","20198990"," far we are following it pretty closely So does it isn't it is it guaranteed that we're going to go"
"20198990","20201230"," up here and roll down here and then go up here?"
"20201430","20204090"," No We actually have an example right here."
"20204290","20210630"," We had an outsized down move right didn't quite follow history But it is coming back end to trade"
"20210630","20216650"," and to play and but it over time it is looking pretty close right And you can see as we"
"20216650","20222230"," come into this close right here today to expect some weakness into next week Another rip higher and"
"20222230","20223090"," then a move down. "
"20223610","20229170"," Okay, we're right here Then there's your all-time high run and then we get a corrective behavior"
"20229170","20237790"," into march So for myself for next week What i'm looking for is something like this So we come back"
"20237790","20239170"," into monday now."
"20239310","20241790"," I don't know if we hold straight right here into monday, right?"
"20242110","20246310"," Or not monday, excuse me tuesday Right Excuse me come into tuesday."
"20246530","20253310"," It's flat and then we make our way down over here Now, I know this goes against what um some"
"20253310","20259310"," of your friends out there are telling you people that you trust I realize that um, I know I think"
"20259310","20267850"," uh gem right now or Gem right now is saying do not expect weakness in the market until the 17th"
"20267850","20274690"," That's right here Do not expect weakness in the market until the 17th, right?"
"20275930","20281350"," now If you scale out a little bit you scale out just a little bit, right?"
"20282350","20285970"," And you can see this parking motion that's taken place, right?"
"20286430","20291210"," They brought price where they want it all way up here Down up down up. "
"20291370","20292150"," What does this look like?"
"20292730","20300310"," Looks like parking it right market brings up price And they're going to park this bad boy into the"
"20300310","20301110"," 17th."
"20301110","20303970"," So the weakness that i'm looking for right now, right?"
"20305390","20308270"," Weakness that i'm looking for doesn't look so weak does it?"
"20309570","20311170"," Does not look that weak is it?"
"20311550","20316310"," So the weakness the put spread that I have on is telling you we're likely going to trade for 70"
"20316930","20323870"," as the target into op-x Now, let's say we don't trade for so say op-x."
"20324030","20328790"," It's actually up here at 480 or something like that Right now if we get the unclenching on the"
"20328790","20336330"," 17th, I'm going to at least be hoping to be paying that into the 30th over here, okay?"
"20337050","20342590"," So for me and what i'm doing here is i've got a put spread on for next week So this"
"20342590","20350770"," is my expectation into next week That we are going to sell off into tuesday We are going to grind"
"20350770","20359310"," down And park the bus into op-x You might excuse me You might have another day or two of"
"20359310","20365790"," up here Consolidize your brake underneath Bull's get all creepy or bull's try to pull it back up,"
"20365970","20366050"," right?"
"20366670","20372890"," Get the confirmation to the downside leg over here And we get even more burr now. "
"20373030","20379190"," I don't know if this put spread is going to pay me Well, it's been pay me, but I don't"
"20379190","20385510"," know if it's going to pay me like the full of 570 bucks Of here it might not right might"
"20385510","20387470"," might squeeze up here in op-x, right?"
"20388150","20395190"," So I have some time on this on this trade so that I can get that Print down here Or"
"20395190","20401070"," I can get that prints later on down here when the when the unclench comes in on the 17th Now"
"20401070","20408150"," stating all of this saying all of this to you For next week and into the end of January and"
"20408150","20415610"," one other thing here too would be this We got to talk about something important here There's"
"20415610","20422410"," something else we have to talk about here Now this here we should make a big run to all-time"
"20422410","20426950"," highs But there's something important to say here."
"20427150","20433170"," There's a trap in here for bulls, okay There's a pretty big trap in here for bulls and I want"
"20433170","20441950"," to talk about that with you right now if possible And that's going back to the 11th of January So"
"20441950","20444470"," right here, do you see where my cursor is right here?"
"20444570","20445330"," You see this right here?"
"20445430","20455430"," There's a trap in here for bulls So I'm walking into my thesis for I'm walking into my thesis here"
"20455430","20458570"," for op-x and for the end of the month, right?"
"20459210","20460810"," And I'm like yeah, everything is honky-dory."
"20461010","20466910"," I'm hoping to get a print here or get a print down here The real problem here is that this"
"20466910","20468550"," gamma flip that's over here. "
"20468750","20475730"," Let me just write that in There's a like a bull trap in here for a lot or I guess"
"20475730","20479450"," that's lack of a better word or that is the right word But there's a bull trap in here with"
"20479450","20486950"," a gamma flip So What does that mean to me as a bull?"
"20487870","20493890"," I'm hoping for this turnaround up here and what can happen to me is this Come down here."
"20494010","20494430"," We come up here."
"20494490","20494910"," Come down here. "
"20495010","20495850"," And I'm all bold up."
"20496350","20502830"," We're under the gamma flip here And I'm thinking we're gonna go to the moon And they roll me right"
"20502830","20509890"," down over here So this is a cause for concern And we end up getting that low and another low"
"20509890","20512570"," in February like blood right bad news over here."
"20512570","20518470"," This is like a I'm thinking we're gonna go to all-time highs and come back down into march for"
"20518470","20524970"," a low And there's actually a really dangerous moment here in the market once we get underneath this"
"20524970","20531750"," gamma flip so If you are looking to if you are following me on this trade and you're like yeah"
"20531750","20536970"," cap Probably get that what I would say to you is Do not buy this right here. "
"20537230","20543490"," This is a no buy for a bull Unless we get above this gamma flip once again, so you'd have"
"20543490","20549770"," to wait until we come up climb above the gamma flip if it is right here You don't want to"
"20549770","20556050"," see any development of new put walls to the downside And you want to see us start climbing higher"
"20556050","20561390"," again and maybe even break these highs before even start getting long for that all-time high So"
"20561390","20567970"," just be aware of the trap that's being set for bulls in here Now, I don't know what Andy's out"
"20567970","20568430"," there saying."
"20568650","20569790"," I don't know what Jim is saying."
"20569970","20574930"," I don't I think I follow those guys Sometimes I see their stuff and I'll comment or read it or"
"20574930","20577510"," whatever So I don't know what the basis is for you guys. "
"20577830","20584050"," I don't know what they've sang out there But i'm telling you that there is a setup here with this"
"20584050","20589250"," gamma flip Uh a trap for bulls where you think it's going up and they're going to drop you down"
"20589250","20589670"," over here."
"20589690","20595530"," It's gonna be a bloodbath So just be careful of this into not next week But as we head down"
"20595530","20602030"," into this over here if you're a bear i'd be really concerned too If we do roll this down into"
"20602030","20608830"," next week Uh, you're going to hear bears telling you that the crash is coming Uh on our op-ex"
"20608830","20613530"," i'm going to tell you that I don't believe that It makes more sense for us to go to the"
"20613530","20618630"," 31st as well end of month Because they still have end of month stuff even though you have op-ex"
"20618630","20622630"," over here You still have end of month stuff that needs to close a bunch of spreads and shit They"
"20622630","20627270"," need to close So I would be really wary of as a matter of fact this line up here should"
"20627270","20637170"," go like this This oh wait a minute just throw that in the trash This line actually likely"
"20637170","20647250"," goes back up some point Right back to where we were for op-ex right up there So"
"20647250","20653470"," let's say if you're a bear right and yeah, we're like doing doing doing sound You're likely going"
"20653470","20657630"," to hear some asshole not asshole some asshole Yeah, some asshole on youtube and some asshole on"
"20657630","20662450"," fucking fin to it Couple of assholes on bloomberg and on fucking wall street journal and CNBC"
"20662450","20666970"," telling you crash You're going to try to get all crash business over here and then you're going to"
"20666970","20673050"," be waiting So if there is a crash, it's likely after the 31st bloodbath down here and there is a"
"20673050","20676590"," bull trap here to be aware of But don't get all crazy down here."
"20676770","20678490"," You're like if you're selling this down here. "
"20678610","20684570"," Don't be like, yeah, you know Uh, i'm fucking balls deep on crash puts down here when in reality,"
"20684930","20689690"," it's like a week down the road Okay, so just be aware of that there is a setup here for"
"20690370","20698430"," um Bulls to get really royally fucked Uh, it likely does not uh likely doesn't begin the real true"
"20698430","20704090"," fucking infurbles does not begin until probably after the 31st That's the highest probability."
"20704390","20705710"," Can it come before in here?"
"20706190","20711290"," Yes But i don't see it happening Uh, i don't so i don't see it happening in the time period"
"20712070","20717830"," Uh that trap for bulls playing out as soon as bears might think that it is So if you're a"
"20717830","20723630"," bear put your blinders on at some point Trade that down wait for this and your your real true entry"
"20723630","20728190"," is probably somewhere in there Okay, probably like right over here in the first or something like"
"20728190","20735850"," that heading into february if it's going to happen If it's going to happen my thesis at this point"
"20735850","20741130"," stands Uh weakness down here more weakness continued weakness into the end of the end of the end of"
"20741130","20749630"," the month Squeeze back up And my thesis is still to the upside so i'm still on upside all-time"
"20749630","20755050"," highs on spx Not e well not we probably get them on es and spy because we've already had them"
"20755050","20764650"," but specifically a all-time highs On spx and then a real real correction When we get that"
"20764650","20770510"," correction It's going to be violent Uh, and you got to be ready for it and there's something else"
"20770510","20775490"," here too if we know we're getting a correction They can say yeah, you know what fuck that we're"
"20775490","20782790"," just going to start selling And another thing about this, uh, gamma flip here You get those real"
"20782790","20788550"," money flows in here you get like you get institutional commercial traders They could just say fuck"
"20788550","20792970"," you and your all-time highs and spx and we just start heading down So be really careful of this"
"20792970","20798390"," in here mechanics of this Now saying all of this for an expectation for next week, right?"
"20798950","20804170"," As long as we stay above the hourly trigger and above the gamma flip the bulls are still in charge"
"20804170","20809910"," here So for all my beard up bearishness into next week and the end of the month I'm going to"
"20809910","20815330"," tell you that um if we if we bounce here in this gamma flip and start heading higher I will"
"20815330","20820390"," ride that shit right up if we bounce off the hourly trigger and keep going higher I'll ride it up."
"20820570","20824170"," I'll ride it up off fucking screen So be aware of that too. "
"20824410","20828930"," So you've got two different things here You've got the extreme bullish or bearishness to the"
"20828930","20834930"," downside Be aware of it, but don't get crazy with it Same thing for the bulls if you're if we're"
"20834930","20840490"," bouncing off the gamma flip and we're bouncing off the hourly trigger and we're making new highs"
"20841060","20848150"," Continue to trade this stuff up even with your thesis or my thesis or whatever Price action still"
"20848150","20856270"," rules always remember that you will never stay in this market If you cannot adjust to a break of"
"20856270","20863030"," your own thesis when you see people out there in public And they're like hey, I'm a bearish here Or"
"20863030","20863430"," I'm bullish."
"20863610","20864470"," Oh, I'm gonna say I'm bullish."
"20864970","20866170"," I'm bullish here, right?"
"20866430","20872310"," And I'm always buying Tesla no matter what Uh on highs lows, no new highs, whatever Don't fucking"
"20872310","20877210"," be that that's not real those people aren't real that they're fake or they got no money So if your"
"20877210","20885250"," thesis or my thesis gets broken be able to adjust to that thesis break Into next week and beyond"
"20885250","20889650"," but this is what I've got for next week This is what I think happens next week This makes sense"
"20889650","20897130"," and actually this still fits some of these other people's narratives For the 17th down here that"
"20897130","20900370"," parking job And you can kind of see it back here. "
"20900470","20901190"," This is familiar, right?"
"20901330","20905350"," You guys know what this is right here It's when they they're parking the fucking bus for the end of"
"20905350","20907910"," the month end of the quarters You'll see this kind of action."
"20908090","20914030"," So for the end of January This is what it looks like my expectation for op-x is a parking"
"20914030","20920850"," of the market at 470 You should see them park it like fucking 470 and like 13 cents or something"
"20920850","20929070"," like that Into Third or excuse me into the 17th at 4 p.m 4 4 70 so we maybe"
"20929070","20935870"," even lower like right down here Come on here Isn't that right down there Right there A little bit"
"20935870","20938550"," more a bit more and this isn't selling is it?"
"20938550","20943550"," This is like normal this if you look back in time This still fits the thesis of some of those"
"20943550","20952430"," guys out there Any questions on this specifically do you have any questions Let me see main screen"
"20952430","20958810"," here You guys can you guys get snaps or snips of that or whatever See, why does the chat go"

"21645890","21646050"," talking monkey."
"21646250","21653580"," I can't do that shit man Uh cap how do I deal with large losses?"
"21653800","21656120"," I have a hard time moving on and let it affect my future training."
"21656260","21657000"," Do you have any tips?"
"21657880","21663500"," um For large losses One, I don't trade a lot all of my accounts. "
"21664160","21670920"," So what i'm trading is percentages one two three four five Uh, the other thing is uh my trade today"
"21670920","21677560"," that i'm losing i'm also in put spreads today So I have a hedge on my on my mischievous behavior"
"21677560","21678520"," right now, right?"
"21679080","21683160"," So here that's another thing to think about right do you have put spreads on while you're taking"
"21683160","21689560"," zero trade or zero day calls right now uh, but for big losses Uh the way that i've dealt with"
"21689560","21695680"," that in the past because I have taken major losses and when I take major losses one time i"
"21696500","21698920"," Destroyed a desk down to a little bit bitty pieces."
"21698980","21703820"," That's no joke like I really did Told my wife and kids are too my kids were young They told"
"21703820","21708280"," to leave with the kids and I took an oak desk a beautiful oak desk down to fucking small firewood"
"21708280","21711880"," not joking Another time I went outside and I kind of fucking tree down."
"21712060","21716500"," That's not a joke Literally went outside and cut a fucking tree down in the backyard. "
"21716500","21725680"," I'm not joking Uh, so when I take those losses Uh, huge losses Um, I get really angry."
"21726120","21735700"," I have a really angry moment Uh, like really angry Uh, huge, uh, then I have a feeling"
"21735700","21745500"," of, um, that i'm a fucking loser Uh big time In the past When I took the biggest"
"21745500","21753960"," losses, I've taken three major losses Uh, those three major losses, I stopped trading for Uh, one"
"21753960","21760840"," to three months somewhere in there one to three months Stop trading Fully nothing don't do anything"
"21760840","21768860"," Uh, and that seemed to help me Uh, just stop trading Uh, take a break and a fucking breather Uh,"
"21769040","21774240"," and then of course the last part is to go back and find out Fundamentally the mistakes that I'm"
"21774240","21781180"," making that I blow up accounts on Um, and then the last part would be Uh, I did eventually learn"
"21781180","21786920"," to move money out of the stock market So that I'm constantly funded if I do blow up now."
"21786980","21789540"," I haven't had a blow up In some time. "
"21789580","21793320"," It's been a few years at least Uh, I got all bared up."
"21793480","21798920"," I think in, uh, no, I don't know what it was I got all bared up once in a 2019"
"21798920","21806580"," or 2020 And I thought we were gonna have a crash and I went pretty fucking heavy and hard On"
"21806580","21812060"," that, uh, Kool-Aid and I lost, I went down that fucking, I took it to zero Um, but I"
"21812060","21817200"," haven't ever, I haven't done that since then so Uh, but I did have to look back and find out"
"21817200","21826000"," the fundamental fuck-ups that I make Uh, in my trading for big losses That's true."
"21826480","21833420"," That's all that's true Um Um, and the stepping away from trading is not a bad thing either Uh, I"
"21833420","21840180"," don't want, if you guys need ever need to take a step away from trading Don't hesitate to Okay,"
"21840500","21850030"," like just do not have These months, so I didn't buy, all right, ready for this I'm still sitting in"
"21850030","21856870"," 477s I did not buy the strike higher I sit and open right now. "
"21857150","21859850"," I have an open order right here For 50 contracts."
"21860210","21860630"," I didn't do 100."
"21860790","21864650"," I have a 50, but I didn't, but I didn't, but I didn't buy them Those are up to 55"
"21864650","21865630"," cents right now. "
"21866010","21871410"," Those are like 25 just a minute, a few minutes ago I'm at nine cents right now."
"21871650","21875870"," Uh, I'm in for a total of about 27 cents On calls right now."
"21876090","21878110"," That's what I'm in in for right now right roughly there. "
"21878190","21883390"," I bought it I think 34 and then I bought it 25 so whatever the difference is there 27 or"
"21883390","21886370"," 29 or something like that somewhere in there Maybe it's higher."
"21886530","21887430"," Maybe it's 30 cents."
"21887610","21893110"," Maybe I'm lying to you So we'll see what happens into this close right now And I never executed the"
"21893110","21897070"," second last part of that trade on this higher strike, so We'll find out what happens. "
"21897210","21906610"," So um On a losses right You're gonna take loss just uh if you're a new trader right when I"
"21906610","21913670"," was a young trader I remember things like there were something stood out to me trading size I went"
"21913670","21919030"," through the motions of like trading 500 bucks trading 1,000 bucks being scared train 5,000 being"
"21919030","21927250"," scared train 10,000 15,000 20,000 Uh, and then eventually I started training real size And uh, I"
"21927250","21927830"," got beat."
"21928090","21928870"," I got really destroyed."
"21929050","21936170"," I got destroyed from about 30,000 dollars to about 100,000 dollars Uh, now I blamed it on"
"21936170","21942130"," everything and I still to this day believe some of that Uh that that they watch who what you're"
"21942130","21942970"," training what you're doing. "
"21942970","21945530"," They package you Uh, these order flow things."
"21945530","21949330"," I think there's like packaging like this guy is doing this and then we package all this shit over"
"21949330","21951670"," here We add this stuff where we need to add it."
"21951710","21958070"," There's or there's like a software that does that Um, so I don't trade that size anymore Uh for me"
"21958070","21963330"," personally, but my point here is now you get scared as you trade more size and stuff like that I"
"21963330","21968710"," did like pull back what i'm trading size and stuff like that Same thing applies for large losses if"
"21968710","21973790"," you have large losses When that happens you need to go back and look and see what's working what"
"21973790","21980170"," did work what doesn't work And move back into that system or find a system Uh where where where you"
"21980170","21984330"," where if you don't like hey, I look back at all my trading history and none of that worked Then"
"21984330","21990790"," you have to learn a system that does consistently, uh pay you you have to have that Um, so you"
"21990790","21997550"," have to have that you have to find a way To find a system that consistently Uh, you can make"
"21997550","22001590"," money from so an example on this I day trade, right?"
"22002490","22011270"," But for me, I also trade overtray or uh for a trade oversold bounces With call spreads And I get"
"22011270","22015850"," I get yelled at for that too people are like why don't just buy zero dates or a weeklies down"
"22015850","22019810"," there You're going to make way more money Uh, but when I've back tested those systems, they don't"
"22019810","22026210"," consistently pay So I need a consistent way to always keep myself funded if I do blow up for me"
"22026210","22032730"," personally So I do the call spread thing I buy uh stock On major lows. "
"22032950","22035650"," I buy stock that gives me more money too, right?"
"22036190","22040290"," And i'm not losing it Well, you know I don't realize those losses unless they go down even deeper"
"22040290","22046830"," and i'm looking for like real good deals On those stock on those uh underlying the stock itself or"
"22046830","22052110"," shares Um, and then I fuck around day trading because i'm a goddamn gambler, right?"
"22052850","22057070"," Uh, if I won't whereas if I was only in a place one or ten trades a year, I'd be"
"22057070","22060410"," fucking rich But you know what we do, you know what we all do it, right?"
"22060570","22063990"," You get on cmbc You get on fin twit you get on wall street pet stock twits, whatever it is"
"22063990","22068850"," and you have to be involved in the market So that's what I do with day trading Uh, I fuck"
"22068850","22073070"," around in the market and I matter of fact I used to not day trade as much as I do"

"22084190","22089650"," Well, that's two sides to this I used to be a really good day trader because I only traded 10"
"22089650","22097130"," trend days You guys being here with me I started trading more than I ever did and that it was"
"22097130","22106030"," a double-edged sword So my win percentage is lower now, but I've become a better trader So I'm kind"
"22106030","22110490"," of paying for a better day trader education Uh in this process."
"22110830","22115570"," I don't know where that leads me to in the future Um because I've never experienced this in my"
"22115570","22115790"," life. "

"22132110","22138010"," I'll have to reconsider right now I'm generally up about 15 to 30 percent day trading at the end of"
"22138010","22144570"," a year But I was way way higher way higher Uh before I was streaming So it could be over"
"22144570","22145270"," trading too."
