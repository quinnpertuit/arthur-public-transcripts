"5260","7200"," Alright, let's see if this works."
"13490","14630"," See if you guys can hear me."
"14870","15850"," I've got a new setup this morning. "
"18130","19410"," You guys hear me?"
"30090","31729"," Check one two, check one."
"48770","50530"," Alright, so I've got a new setup this morning."
"51330","59970"," Try to hook up multiple monitors so that I can day trade easier. "
"62430","67830"," Right now I've got trying to run off just a couple monitors but now I've got five setup."
"69010","70030"," Good morning everybody."
"72870","73650"," Let's see everybody. "
"74490","85800"," One nice thing is that I can turn off YouTube on another"
"85800","88060"," monitor here and just go through streamlabs."
"90000","93980"," Morning Liz, Rateesh, Jasmine, Omar, Dan, Angie, Ricardo, Liz."
"94780","95400"," We got Robert. "
"95920","96500"," Good morning everybody."
"100240","108320"," Alright, so this morning I do have the hero indicator working over here."
"109180","110440"," This is the spy feed. "
"111560","115440"," We'll be checking the spy feed today and those are a few things we'll do."
"117260","121920"," We are going to check on the overall market health today."
"124840","131180"," Now I want you all to realize or make a note this morning that. "
"133780","143680"," A spot gammas claiming I think it's four, seven, five, four, seven, five,"
"143680","144060"," zero."
"144720","147620"," I think spot gammas claiming that's support."
"154950","158150"," Maybe adjust your charts today if you're trading. "
"159910","168280"," If you're going to day trade to the spy today, I'm going to adjust your charts so that I think"
"168280","170260"," I've got mine set to four, seven, five, zero."
"171080","177820"," I've got four, seven, six, point three, nine, four, seven, eight, point seven, six, and four,"
"178120","179460"," eight, zero, zero."
"181200","183400"," So that should be the trading range today. "
"186120","191520"," I'll read it off one more time to you four, seven, four, point nine, seven."
"191780","193640"," That's basically four, seven, five, zero."
"195480","205380"," Four, seven, six, point three, nine, four, seven, eight, point seven, six, and then four, eight,"
"205440","205860"," zero. "
"205860","208340"," And that's what I'm going to look at to be day trading."
"211360","216920"," If I trade some spy today, actively trade some spy today, I've got two, I'll put up my brokerage"
"216920","218240"," here and see what I got going on."
"220240","226860"," So I've got some spy calls and I've got some spy puts. "
"227560","234130"," I've got some puts as a hedge at the end of the day yesterday."
"235030","243830"," In case we did experience some weakness now into Friday, as the time whittles away as time moves"
"243830","244170"," on."
"246500","251520"," I was wondering this morning, I think I asked somebody on Twitter earlier this morning if they"
"251520","258959"," thought that they would, if that traders would front run weakness in the market looking towards"
"258959","262120"," banks hedging on Friday or Thursday. "
"262120","266220"," I did have that concern."
"266480","268300"," I was like in some lucid moment this morning."
"268340","272680"," I thought to myself, maybe they'll front run weakness. "
"275160","276480"," People will panic early."
"277460","282720"," Because everybody knows right that there should be some weakness between Friday and Monday."
"285760","293160"," What do I have for put so the puts that I have are about January 3rd for 60 P's. "
"293380","295860"," They were slightly down into the close last night."
"296540","298560"," Not enough, not significant enough."
"299100","301860"," I probably should have made them short, made them short, short or dated. "
"303120","308880"," But I was, I had just gotten home with my kids and I was like, I just wanted to throw"
"308880","311780"," something on just in case."
"312600","316140"," And so we're just trading sideways in the spy at this moment where you guys can see there was a"
"316140","317980"," bounce on the spy."
"321800","322740"," Turn this off. "
"322860","325020"," Sorry, I got some alarms going off just in case I don't."
"325780","327140"," Get on here with you."
"327660","330440"," I'm interested in Tesla this morning. "
"331040","333560"," And possibly trading Tesla today."
"333880","338040"," You saw that bounce off of close to one or to 11 20."
"338580","340540"," That's where resistance was yesterday. "
"341640","345620"," Was at that 11 20 and you can see this morning before we open up."
"346560","349000"," That's moved down to."
"350320","358940"," To 1100 the supply of sellers has moved down so which is interesting. "
"361950","365970"," As you remember yesterday the dip by was at 10 70 and 10 80."
"368780","374260"," And yesterday also the wall was really at 11 20."
"374420","376760"," So you can see that there's a press this morning. "
"377440","381500"," At the bell you can see that there's a push down, right?"
"382080","383060"," They're going to try to that shorts."
"383080","385040"," I'm going to try to make a move into this morning."
"386860","389560"," Just be conscious of that as we open. "
"391600","396180"," Though the sellers and buyers are quite close to each other right now we are it's illiquid still in"
"396180","396720"," pre market."
"397080","403060"," The market really doesn't mean that much at this time, but you can see that there's a wall of"
"403060","404480"," sellers waiting for the bell."
"404480","409620"," On the open now sometimes when I when I day trade the Tesla. "
"410260","412180"," I'll be looking for a day like today."
"412740","415480"," It seems like the news is getting better for Tesla."
"416340","418480"," So and we are in somewhat of a."
"420500","423800"," Of a bearish. "
"425480","429780"," The last three days the slow move up we could have a little bit of weakness here at the open."
"429780","435360"," Now if we did have weakness in the open though it's it's sort of like back when we day trade"
"435360","436620"," I think we day traded this."
"440440","444780"," Back on December 21st or maybe it was back on. "
"446910","452650"," It goes back on December 14th we day traded it and what happened was you saw the you saw people"
"452650","453550"," trying to cover shorts."
"454330","461590"," So I'm hoping that this morning that there are some shorts that will try to try to push down."
"462970","463990"," Tesla briefly. "
"465570","469090"," Then flip ball and ride it up for 70 or 100 points."
"469570","473890"," I don't know if that happens right away this morning when we make a straight up."
"474250","478390"," You can you never can tell you can see the buyers are stepping in right now. "
"481030","487790"," But if you if you see this big dip in Tesla this morning it might open itself to a nice"
"487790","488410"," day trade."
"488410","490890"," So I'm interested in day trade in Tesla today."
"491170","497090"," There's a bunch of great news out there for Tesla right now and if there's panic among shorts they"
"497090","498290"," will try to dump it. "
"498650","503590"," I know that they'll try to so they did try to this morning once we came in I think it"
"503590","504850"," was 4 a.m. they started right."
"505170","510810"," Yeah right at four o'clock we went we went straight up to resistance they tried selling it down."
"511230","515610"," We have seen this too many times that it reminds me of one of those days right. "
"515610","519030"," You start out really strong in the morning look like you're going to be weak at the open."
"519350","525350"," You dump opening bell and then the first 15 20 minutes we grab that bottom you can make 70 to"
"525350","528790"," 90 points by midday or 100 points or so."
"529090","532250"," And we trail off a little bit and everybody panics everybody but top. "
"532650","536110"," I don't know if that's going to happen this morning but I'm watching for it to happen."
"536510","539150"," So if it does happen this morning I want to keep tests on the feed."
"539770","543730"," There's just too much good news coming in right now if you were a call seller right now you would"
"543730","545450"," be doing two things right. "
"545610","550010"," You'd be trying to dump them out and trying to dump Tesla with all this good news coming out."
"550510","557510"," If you're short if you're a short seller or if you're short if you're short the Tesla you don't"
"557510","558230"," want it to go up."
"558890","564830"," And as we head into Friday previous years we've had very good Christmases or holiday rallies for"
"564830","565050"," Tesla. "
"565490","571430"," Sometimes they start after the first of the year the shorts will win but even when the shorts do"
"571430","573870"," win this week into the third of January."
"574550","580050"," It's still usually a very positive this time of year for Tesla so you just have to find where"
"580050","580850"," you're buying in."
"582590","588830"," Yesterday the buy-in was at 1080 1070 we had some buyers at 1090 yesterday that bought that the"
"588830","591350"," 1090 dip at the end of 1080 1070. "
"591870","596530"," And it's still up for buying yesterday at 1090 if anybody got it at 1090 yesterday."
"597250","601370"," So I'm interested in Tesla to see what it's going to do this morning."
"601870","605350"," And even if it doesn't if we can't trade it we won't trade it this morning. "
"605810","608710"," We'll watch it to see if we can trade it if we can't trade it though."
"608950","614590"," We'll watch the flow this morning to see if any flow comes in that we can trade."
"619610","624370"," And if let's say spy trade sideways one more day that you know I do want to let you guys"
"624370","629170"," know that the longer that we trade sideways on the spy and the market in general. "
"629570","633170"," As we head into Friday the market will grow weaker."
"633170","635870"," So no matter and that that's true."
"636090","641170"," So what will happen is really they got a day or two of consolidation a nice wedge will spring up. "
"641690","647770"," And if nothing takes place between now and Thursday the risk becomes greater that we begin to look"
"647770","648110"," below."
"649230","651150"," So I'll be be conscious of that."
"651490","658950"," It's why I threw the hedge on yesterday I didn't like the idea of the passage of time and try"
"658950","660290"," and spy trading sideways. "
"661750","663930"," We do have the hero indicator today."
"665810","672470"," So we will if we stay on the spy or on Tesla for the entire day today we should be"
"672470","677710"," able to figure out if if anything's happening if we see the hero indicator going up the opposite"
"677710","678170"," direction."
"680030","683830"," We'll take a look you know you can this kind of way right here you see this in pre-market"
"683830","685230"," we really didn't see this yesterday. "
"685230","689990"," You see this nice see this nice band of support down here at 45."
"690690","697990"," We've got support right now at 47 6.76 on the spy because you see all these waiting buyers down"
"697990","698230"," below."
"698750","703110"," My assumption is that the day traders want to buy this and run it up to 480 today. "
"706910","710710"," And we did have a lot of positive calls into close yesterday we had the cues a lot of buyers"
"710710","715570"," of of the cues a lot of buyers of spy plus individual tickers."
"716150","717110"," Good morning everybody."
"720220","726980"," Yeah we've got some crazy interest we have 30 a 30% increase in options on Tesla Tesla gang knows"
"726980","732460"," for sure that this time of year there's usually window dressing right. "
"733200","736020"," We want some window dressing on Tesla before the 31st."
"736380","740180"," You know that the banks are wrapped up in Tesla that they're going to want to take some profit and"
"740180","745600"," be here and that's that's what everyone's banking on heading into the first does it happen now does"
"745600","747200"," it happen on the 31st I don't know."
"747200","753620"," But we're going to watch it today because it's going to be an interesting day for Tesla next couple"
"753620","753860"," days. "
"753960","759700"," I'm interested I don't know if you guys are interested in Tesla but I'm certainly interested in any"
"759700","766720"," of the tickers like Tesla Apple Amazon anything the banks are wrapped up in it's end of the year."
"767540","773040"," Are they going to I don't think that they're going to sell out of those positions before the 31st I"
"773040","774400"," think they want it to look good in their books."
"775100","779400"," They might want to make other tickers look bad in their books for the tax loss harvesting. "
"780140","784500"," But when you look at a ticker like Apple I'm finding it hard to believe that they're going to want"
"784500","790680"," to dump Apple the day before the end of the year maybe anything's possible in this market we all"
"790680","791140"," know this."
"791700","800160"," But my my thought process is you've had three days we've had we came up on on Tesla we came"
"800160","805240"," up on the 23rd and then it's been consolidation on Tesla for three days it's looked slightly"
"805240","805880"," bearish."
"806240","811920"," But for that for three days of consolidation for all of this these option contracts that are being"
"811920","816120"," taken out and a lot of them are outside of the money and a lot of them are nicely dated"
"816120","817380"," into January February. "
"817980","823140"," We've got some outside the money calls as well on Tesla that I'm interested in watching it it could"
"823140","824280"," be a good day for Tesla."
"825260","828860"," And there could be some some short panic and some."
"830720","836560"," Just some general panic lens volatility to the stock and spies look in the same way too something"
"836560","843600"," you get to figure spy came up on 27th and it's been two days of consolidation for spy it hasn't"
"843600","844100"," gone down. "
"844100","851040"," If we were to stay sideways trade sideways into Thursday Friday I expected down day but if today"
"851040","856740"," you know you've got two good days of consolidation it's possible we could trade up to 480 maybe"
"856740","859800"," trade down into Friday it's possible we could trade down right off the bell here."
"860620","866000"," Things come swooping back up on Friday too so I'm just interested to see where we're at today I'm"
"866000","867040"," sure you guys are as well."
"868780","874340"," Yeah Tesla's got a bunch of different catalysts coming up they've got they've got positive"
"874340","882000"," catalysts coming up all next month into February and they you can see some of the news is turning"
"882000","883020"," positive on Tesla. "
"884300","889420"," And if you've been trading Tesla or if you pay attention to Tesla every day you know that if you"
"889420","893300"," try to year round you know that there's some expectation of movement here."
"893300","898920"," You can see it in just the option chains but there's some expectation that we move maybe they and"
"898920","903540"," sometimes as you know they'll burn a lot of these high interest calls and then they make the move"
"903540","903900"," after."
"904480","909800"," So I'm not really concerned if it happens today or if it happens beginning of next week but I'm"
"909800","911600"," going to expect some type of a move. "
"914050","917970"," I want to catch that movement it happens you guys all want to to assuming as well."
"919030","925690"," Let's look at the Tesla feed real quick see if there's any interest building and you can see down"
"925690","931110"," here you can see buyers are starting to step up as they move into the last five minutes."
"931110","934490"," Matter of fact we just had an influx of buyers on Tesla. "
"935770","937170"," You guys are watching this."
"942860","944420"," I'm interested in Tesla right now."
"950980","952900"," Let's see I've got tasty works up. "
"953360","963170"," I want Twitter up to for the news and I want new squawk up"
"963170","983560"," treasury yields"
"983560","984160"," are rising."
"999800","1002340"," Yeah the exercising of stocks is good news."
"1002340","1006520"," You see buyers stepping in here already pre-market right now. "
"1007500","1013340"," There's going to be some panic and fear out there if you're if you're a short Tesla right now it's"
"1013340","1017320"," not I mean we might still go down but I wouldn't be taking a short on Tesla right now."
"1017420","1019640"," I wouldn't I wouldn't be shorting in any way shape or form."
"1020640","1026520"," I don't short Tesla but if I was shorting Tesla and you had the right conditions to short Tesla. "
"1028240","1030000"," Other than what it looks like on a chart."
"1033160","1038280"," I'm going to expect that charts are going to try down on FM F themselves at this moment."
"1038280","1039819"," This is a critical point for Tesla. "
"1045500","1047040"," So what are we seeing on spy here."
"1047280","1049360"," So I just talked to you guys about spy."
"1049740","1051300"," If you want to day trade spy today. "
"1055460","1059500"," I'm looking at a day trade spy from four seven five zero."
"1060380","1062500"," Would be the BTFD."
"1064260","1068480"," The by the depth is four seven six point three nine. "
"1069600","1076740"," And you trade it up to four seven eight point seven six or four eight zero."
"1077700","1084500"," I would become or start to become bearish today on spy if we traded below four seven five zero."
"1085200","1088960"," Not full bear but that should be support today. "
"1091140","1097520"," And it would also be considering if we stay range the longer we stay range bound on spy."
"1098680","1103320"," The greater the chance that we trade down into Thursday and Friday on spy."
"1104500","1111740"," I was looking at spot gamma put out a dot plot this morning of where all the interest is. "
"1112620","1118280"," On the spy right now and we're not really getting the traction right now it seems like."
"1118900","1123540"," We're not getting the traction that we want we're getting traction on individual tickers in the"
"1123540","1123860"," market."
"1125850","1132350"," But it seems like people are waiting for that JPM caller or whatever GS is going to do. "
"1132930","1136770"," Whatever the big big banks are going to do for and they haven't done they haven't done what they're"
"1136770","1137470"," supposed to do yet."
"1137470","1139090"," So everyone's waiting."
"1139690","1141350"," It's a big waiting game right now. "
"1141570","1142530"," It's like Mexican standoff."
"1144980","1145560"," And that's fine."
"1145720","1147300"," I can wait with them you guys can wait with them. "
"1148740","1153260"," But I can't be bullish or bearish at this point I want to see I think everybody wants to see"
"1153260","1156360"," what the big banks are doing for the next."
"1157420","1161080"," Three months with the plan is for the for the next three months."
"1162580","1173110"," What do you guys think about that you guys"
"1173110","1174530"," want to see the spy feed real quick. "
"1179000","1181640"," You guys want to see the spy feed when we open or do you want to see the."
"1183220","1183700"," The."
"1185480","1186600"," Testful feed as we open. "
"1188440","1190120"," A little more granular."
"1190360","1194080"," Yeah, I just see buyers down here in the spy."
"1194540","1196740"," These buyers are just waiting to buy the dip and run it up. "
"1197340","1206320"," So the buyers right now on the dip by are currently at 476.76. And they're moving up right now."
"1214720","1217980"," You can see that these buyers moved straight up into this area here."
"1217980","1225580"," Do you see this hero indicator down below here see this purple line down below. "
"1226440","1234900"," This purple line is showing you if more calls or puts are being bought on the ticker or on."
"1235740","1236800"," The index."
"1237340","1243420"," So this big swooping pattern right here this big purple swooping pattern is showing you. "
"1244600","1247500"," If we have more more calls or more puts."
"1247500","1252460"," And when the hero indicator is going up."
"1253320","1257080"," The with this hero indicator is going up and showing you. "
"1260660","1263700"," If we have more calls more puts whatever if you see the hero indicator."
"1263720","1267940"," Stay up in the price of spy is staying flat or down."
"1268720","1273120"," It would indicate that the market is lying and that we're actually going to go up. "
"1276980","1279820"," All of these little rectangles that you see are these."
"1279820","1283820"," These are diamonds I guess mountains."
"1284580","1286000"," These are options. "
"1286920","1288240"," They're not equities."
"1289020","1293760"," So you're actually looking at options being taken out on the market."
"1295220","1299240"," And you can see that spy is going up right now. "
"1305470","1308630"," I can make let me make these a little bit smaller so that."
"1310150","1313210"," You can see the bubbles for the equities underneath."
"1315470","1319070"," Size of largest icon make that 50. "
"1321920","1323000"," Small icon."
"1329620","1330180"," There."
"1333410","1335990"," Maybe that'll help you guys so you can see all the bubbles. "
"1336850","1340510"," And then you can see the options trades as well."
"1340790","1343110"," So now you're watching equities and options."
"1343890","1346010"," See this hero indicator going down. "
"1350960","1354180"," Keep your eyes posted on the right here on the right hand side."
"1354800","1357400"," See how the hero indicator is."
"1358380","1361520"," You've got this purple glowing over here and then you've got. "
"1362360","1364700"," If the hero indicator is positive."
"1365440","1368100"," It means that the options are positive right now."
"1368220","1370480"," The options are winning or calls are winning. "
"1371400","1375520"," And then left hand side here you can see the equities being purchased."
"1375520","1378980"," And you can see that we have more buyers than sellers in the spy right at the open."
"1378980","1383200"," And now we're going to switch briefly to Tesla. "
"1391730","1393850"," And as expected you'll see Tesla."
"1393950","1396890"," We've got way more sellers than we do have buyers right off the bell."
"1397690","1401850"," You can see the hero cumulative is negative 1100. "
"1402350","1405050"," See how the hero indicator down here."
"1405110","1418400"," I'll turn this one to me adjust this one to 50."
"1423860","1426940"," We'll change this to that magenta or whatever color. "
"1427500","1429320"," So it's the same across the board."
"1436360","1444280"," I don't know why that hero color is not different."
"1444720","1445420"," Let me check that again. "
"1446500","1447780"," You can figure add-ons."
"1448380","1448600"," Oh no."
"1449900","1451480"," Make this one green. "
"1457170","1457470"," Line green."
"1459690","1460090"," I sell."
"1464080","1465640"," Let's see if that works. "
"1466380","1467320"," We're back to green and red."
"1468020","1469620"," Where is the line color?"
"1471760","1473320"," So icon hero indicator."
"1475360","1476360"," Where is the line color?"
"1476660","1477320"," I sell vertical. "
"1478040","1479260"," I don't know what I'm doing wrong here."
"1479640","1480400"," Doing something wrong."
"1481040","1488420"," Anyways, you can see weakness in Tesla at this point. "
"1494180","1497100"," You can see the hero indicator is down on Tesla."
"1498940","1501060"," This is not positive right now."
"1501200","1503120"," It doesn't really mean as much right now. "
"1503600","1508320"," It will mean a lot more as the hero indicator swings to this left here."
"1508320","1516410"," But you see the difference in Tesla's price right now and spies price right now."
"1533180","1539980"," And I just want to give you guys an update that MU has multiple call options coming out on it"
"1539980","1540440"," right now. "
"1542220","1543000"," So look at MU."
"1553000","1554240"," MU is doing MU."
"1561390","1573160"," There's multiple call options 1231 100 318 105 1231 95 1231 94. "
"1581400","1588240"," Do you see the do you see down here the hero indicator is super high right now?"
"1588240","1590340"," It sits at the top top of the bar up here."
"1592140","1594840"," You see that the buyers are."
"1596840","1598280"," Stupidly outnumbering. "
"1601500","1604780"," It's like 1.1 million buyers to."
"1606740","1609960"," 240,000 sellers on MU."
"1610420","1611720"," So take a look at MU. "
"1611720","1621460"," And I would say that yeah the price target at MU"
"1621460","1625180"," is well it looks like they tagged 95 right bounced off."
"1625760","1631420"," Above here they destroyed some of the sellers up in here but the ultimate target would be 100."
"1631860","1633460"," So maybe wait for a dip on MU. "
"1637800","1640500"," It looks like the buyers are relentless here too doesn't it?"
"1643180","1648780"," There's a small band of buyers down here at 93 24."
"1649360","1652940"," If you can capture dip on 93 24 that would be a gift."
"1655930","1656990"," I'm going to get rid of that MU feed. "
"1657090","1658530"," Do you guys have all that information on MU?"
"1659590","1660510"," MU is cranking."
"1664140","1667300"," It looks like buyers are stepping up here at 94 04."
"1668000","1670800"," The next band is down below at 93 28. "
"1673850","1674450"," You can go deeper."
"1674970","1676810"," It gives us a smart money anywhere down here."
"1686560","1688820"," Some buyers down at 90 89. "
"1689540","1690460"," It looks pretty aggressive."
"1692180","1694040"," I think it might be a nice play right now on you."
"1721240","1729000"," Dip buyers stepping in on Tesla same place 10 75 10 85 10 90 running it up. "
"1729140","1733240"," This looks like boiler room stuff to me on Tesla."
"1733520","1736360"," Looks like straight boiler room stuff."
"1747980","1757620"," Nvidia has a bid this morning 278,000 in calls right at 930 they've got 1231 at 310 and 315"
"1757620","1758960"," and 320. "
"1759080","1763420"," Calls for December 31st and January 7th."
"1763580","1764820"," Facebook's catching a bid."
"1765180","1771460"," Netflix, Walmart, Apple, Disney, VOD and KO. "
"1773260","1774820"," I'll have bids on them."
"1783100","1786400"," Lots of puts coming in on DKNG and Donkey Kong."
"1788060","1788740"," DraftKings. "
"1789880","1795640"," They've got puts to man they don't like you know what's weird."
"1795640","1805420"," Someone on CNBC was talking about one of the online betting sites being either being"
"1805420","1809760"," shorted in the ground and closing that they're losing money but nobody knows."
"1810580","1822890"," Everyone was saying it was a 10 national gaming but it's like a DKNG deal DraftKings. "
"1824570","1831650"," There was some commentary that one of these online betting companies is going bankrupt and it's"
"1831650","1832830"," unknown right now."
"1839380","1842560"," I'm telling like DKNG is already down at 25 bucks."
"1843940","1849720"," It's already been shorted into the ground and it's got still has massive massive flow coming in"
"1849720","1851000"," against it. "
"1851740","1854180"," I wonder if does anybody know anything about DKNG?"
"1855580","1856420"," I'll show you spy."
"1860320","1862200"," There's a nice action on spy by the way."
"1862900","1868260"," You've got spies going up just if anyone wants to know you can see that the heroin decay is high. "
"1868660","1872660"," You can see that the equity buyers are through the roof on spy."
"1873640","1878220"," So you might get a print on the Tesla Tesla car in spy calls this morning."
"1881650","1887930"," I already gave you guys the by the dip numbers and the sell the rip numbers on spy right. "
"1892710","1896190"," The first resistance is going to be 47876 and then 480."
"1897770","1900110"," This is really nice action right here on the spy."
"1901590","1902690"," It's going to go up. "
"1903470","1907370"," You see how much more action there is today on spy versus yesterday?"
"1910610","1912250"," What do I mean by boiler room stuff?"
"1913070","1915210"," So no it's not pumping up."
"1915550","1921120"," So there are companies that you can get hired at."
"1923420","1924960"," Oftentimes it's remote work now. "
"1925380","1926600"," You can actually do it from home."
"1927000","1929080"," You can apply to these companies and work from home."
"1929360","1935140"," But there used to be office spaces where you'd have young traders and they'd put them on an office. "
"1935320","1936540"," They'd put 20, 30, 50 guys."
"1936900","1937840"," Not like you see in movies."
"1938100","1941420"," These are professional houses and all they do is trade one or two tickers. "
"1941620","1945340"," They trade Apple all day long or they trade Tesla all day long."
"1945920","1949720"," And on slow days there are easy setups."
"1950000","1957840"," You just day trade 5, 10, 20 minute, 40 minute setups on tickers right?"
"1958500","1959900"," It's like if I'm only trading Apple. "
"1961260","1968320"," Oftentimes when Apple doesn't have news to move it, if you trade Apple often you can see the hand"
"1968320","1973980"," of, I guess you could call them professional traders, but they're just young traders out of college"
"1973980","1974880"," out of finance school."
"1975400","1980980"," They get interviewed, they're put through a training program and then they find a system that works"
"1980980","1981400"," for them."
"1981540","1987280"," And if they can paper trade and make money consistently, they're put on a specific stock and that's"
"1987280","1988180"," all you do all day long. "
"1988220","1990760"," You just trade that one ticker all day long."
"1991220","1997040"," And you'll notice that when you, you'll notice those patterns inside of specific tickers."
"1997040","2002120"," You'll notice them inside of Apple's and Amazon's and Tesla's spy. "
"2002600","2003240"," Same thing in spy."
"2003240","2011680"," Sometimes I make a lot more money on slow days on spy than I do on days where spy moves"
"2011680","2015680"," because you can use classic setups."
"2016840","2026370"," I guess you'd call it classic charting setups can sometimes"
"2026370","2028290"," yield great results on the spy. "
"2028290","2036520"," If you're, or ES, if you're just day trading on a nice slow, slow moving day, hold on one second"
"2036520","2036960"," here."
"2039720","2083139"," I'm going to"
"2083139","2084300"," get this Tesla feed up."
"2087550","2089550"," You've got nice supply on Tesla now. "
"2090170","2091909"," Still have heavy sellers on Tesla."
"2108840","2111240"," Someone's saying that Nvidia is dumping out there."
"2111360","2112200"," You guys watching Nvidia. "
"2112200","2112420"," Nvidia."
"2125320","2125800"," Oof."
"2126280","2127300"," Nice dip on Nvidia. "
"2132930","2133810"," It's funny too."
"2133950","2135630"," What were they saying on yesterday on CNBC?"
"2137050","2140950"," They were saying that you should buy Nvidia, right?"
"2141270","2142310"," That was what they said yesterday."
"2142930","2143550"," Did you guys hear that?"
"2145090","2146170"," They were like, buy Nvidia. "
"2146610","2146890"," Did you guys?"
"2147070","2147850"," Did you guys see that?"
"2148410","2150830"," Did you guys see that news from CNBC yesterday?"
"2150830","2154090"," They were like, buy semiconductors."
"2159980","2161200"," They said, give up Tesla."
"2161540","2163380"," Don't buy Tesla and buy semiconductors. "
"2164420","2166480"," And there's semiconductors just dumping."
"2174960","2178800"," You guys keep your eyes on the NASDAQ right now."
"2179260","2180440"," It's looking kind of bearish. "
"2183820","2185940"," We're going to take a look at the queues real quick."
"2185940","2195900"," I want to see if there's anything under the surface that we're"
"2195900","2196280"," not seeing."
"2216320","2218000"," Or is this just a fake out?"
"2230440","2232540"," Be real careful in tech this morning. "
"2241600","2242640"," See what's happening."
"2244100","2244920"," Now we're good."
"2245440","2245740"," Tech's fine. "
"2246940","2247820"," Scratch that."
"2249780","2251600"," So tech right now."
"2252320","2255420"," NASDAQ looks very dumpy, right?"
"2255420","2261700"," On the surface, it looks dumpy, but it doesn't look dumpy here on what I'm looking at. "
"2262640","2263500"," So that's interesting."
"2264140","2267880"," So right now, if I was trading NASDAQ, if I was trading the queues, I'd probably be buying some"
"2267880","2268080"," puts."
"2269380","2271700"," And I don't want to be buying puts right now. "
"2280300","2282200"," It looks like some more sideways shit."
"2284120","2292600"," So if you guys look at the QQQ's, right?"
"2295540","2297180"," It's showing buyers at 400."
"2298280","2299220"," That makes sense. "
"2299960","2303500"," But then those buyers could disappear and you end up dumping the 396."
"2304560","2306120"," I guess it does look kind of dumpy."
"2308400","2313100"," I'm going to put some, I'm going to snap some lines on 400 and see what happens. "
"2319400","2321040"," The queues look like it's going to dump down to 400."
"2321820","2324520"," And it looks like those buyers might disappear down to 390."
"2325500","2331000"," On here it says 398, but I'm betting that it's down at 396 is more legit. "
"2334710","2335110"," Nope."
"2335350","2336350"," There's no support at 396."
"2337710","2338570"," It's a little bit. "
"2340550","2342850"," 394 hundred is looking like where that's where it's at."
"2343890","2345290"," So I snap the line on 400."
"2347430","2349630"," We'll see if they stick around or if they disappear. "
"2355150","2356150"," And this is the same thing."
"2356250","2361390"," If you guys are watching right now, this is the same action as yesterday, right?"
"2361390","2364010"," You got buyers down here, 400, you got sellers above at 405."
"2366630","2368210"," It doesn't look like a lot. "
"2372590","2375690"," Tesla just bounced off the 1080 buy zone down below here."
"2376270","2377410"," Buyers didn't disappear."
"2378590","2379470"," Same story. "
"2380410","2381970"," Buy at 1080 to buy at 1070."
"2385660","2387880"," There's no real sellers until you get to 1100."
"2389840","2391240"," You get some stepping in. "
"2393560","2398060"," But you do have some negative flow coming in that's not showing up on flow."
"2398060","2406030"," And you definitely have some sellers hiding above on Tesla."
"2406030","2407770"," So I don't think Tesla's ready either. "
"2410360","2412120"," MU is cranking, by the way."
"2412700","2413860"," I talked to you guys about MU."
"2414660","2416460"," MU is just blasting off. "
"2416660","2420660"," It just ripped through the first resistance at 95."
"2423880","2425040"," Well, we're going to take a look at MU."
"2439580","2441280"," You guys watching MU out there?"
"2441880","2444780"," MU is just a straight shot to the moon. "
"2444780","2460610"," It's looking"
"2460610","2461070"," to see."
"2474740","2475500"," It's a nice play."
"2484700","2487400"," Hero indicator is off the charts on MU. "
"2487780","2489100"," Just want you guys to know that out there."
"2489740","2490960"," So we looked at five."
"2491200","2491680"," We looked at Tesla. "
"2492520","2495360"," Hero indicator is blasting off on MU."
"2496120","2498160"," Your big resistance is at 100."
"2498820","2500120"," We just bounced off 95. "
"2501120","2503180"," We're consuming sellers right now."
"2503260","2504040"," You can see down below."
"2504260","2510440"," We've got almost three times the amount of buyers as sellers on MU. "
"2512700","2514600"," MU is worth watching still."
"2515200","2515980"," It's up two bucks."
"2520590","2522230"," We're going to keep it on MU here for a minute. "
"2522630","2524610"," I'm going to grab a trade here at MU."
"2528480","2533000"," I'll post the call flow on Twitter right now for MU."
"2533280","2536000"," So if any of you guys don't have that call flow, I'll show you what's out there. "
"2574440","2575960"," That flow camera right enough, the bell."
"2580160","2582280"," Is there some news on MU that we don't know about?"
"2607960","2614200"," After strong earnings release, micron technology stocks looks to extend its rally."
"2614880","2615340"," All right. "
"2615540","2615980"," I guess so."
"2616900","2618860"," I really like to see something better than that."
"2623300","2627580"," Micron declares a 10 cent quarterly dividend. "
"2631750","2633270"," I was just 10 seconds ago."
"2649210","2650690"," Some heavy flow into Micron."
"2653420","2655260"," Micron is just ripping right now. "
"2655340","2656960"," It's about to consume every single seller."
"2659930","2661070"," Micron's straight ripping."
"2672270","2674290"," You're looking to break through here. "
"2676430","2680110"," 95, 92 and 96, 07."
"2681090","2686730"," You guys can break through 96, 96, 08 or so."
"2686830","2689030"," It's clear skies to 97. "
"2693550","2694370"," Light resistance."
"2697940","2699060"," Yeah, that's it."
"2699560","2703580"," You got some resistance above it, 97, but then it's light resistance. "
"2703900","2705680"," But you got almost clear skies to 100."
"2706820","2710660"," So you guys want to let people know on Twitter or whatever you guys talk to out there."
"2711380","2712360"," Let me use looking strong. "
"2712720","2713240"," Very strong."
"2719580","2720540"," Strong to 100."
"2731400","2732820"," Like you guys can see this right. "
"2733200","2735520"," This is three times the number of buyers of sellers."
"2736440","2739600"," The hero indicators off the charts."
"2760470","2761590"," My audio keeps breaking. "
"2761850","2762770"," Can you guys hear me right now?"
"2763650","2764310"," I'm going to do a check."
"2764750","2766170"," Angie, tell me if you can hear me."
"2766750","2768530"," Check one, two, check one, two. "
"2772440","2773760"," You guys hear me?"
"2779580","2780520"," Big time shop?"
"2784530","2785170"," Damn it."
"2806300","2807260"," Lots of buffering."
"2807920","2808500"," Goddamn it. "
"2808940","2809800"," Sorry for swearing."
"2813490","2816250"," Let's see if I can run this off of a, hold on one second here."
"2816490","2817530"," Let's see if you're still getting buffering. "
"2861340","2863500"," Can you guys hear me now or no?"
"2872000","2874160"," You'll have to turn it off today."
"2876140","2877720"," Is it still buffering?"
"2880460","2882160"," It doesn't look like it's buffering from my side."
"2886890","2887810"," Give me just a second here. "
"2888230","2889630"," It shouldn't be buffering any longer."
"2907180","2908920"," Jamie and I can see the live chats."
"2915650","2919570"," But I, I gotta put a headset on it and think so. "
"2919670","2921050"," I can listen to my voice."
"2963810","2964130"," Yeah."
"2964330","2965970"," So I'm in 100 calls on MU. "
"3006900","3008280"," Can you guys hear me right now or no?"
"3011320","3013060"," So that's where it's not lagging on my end."
"3013560","3015420"," Are you sure it's still lagging right now at this moment?"
"3018650","3019750"," Let's see if I can reset this."
"3073240","3074300"," Can you guys hear me right now?"
"3076780","3077840"," Right into the mic check right now. "
"3077900","3078700"," I want to see if you guys hear me."
"3079120","3080320"," This is my cursor going around."
"3080720","3081960"," Does that look like it's lagging to you?"
"3092180","3093060"," Good morning, Joe. "
"3093280","3093540"," How are you?"
"3094500","3096100"," Are you guys getting lag right now?"
"3102660","3103060"," Tesla?"
"3112410","3115750"," Let's see if you guys, a Tesla feed up and running here."
"3142020","3146680"," You see all this negative hero over here on the right hand side on Tesla?"
"3152230","3152890"," Is it better?"
"3153850","3154610"," Okay, you guys can hear me now."
"3157060","3160200"," So I had a bunch of monitors hooked up to one laptop. "
"3161180","3164420"," Wanted to see if that would work this morning, but you can tell that's not working."
"3165520","3168120"," I had four monitors hooked up."
"3170100","3171960"," I probably should have done that. "
"3174060","3178880"," So I'm plugged a bunch of monitors and I just have the one monitor with the."
"3180320","3181320"," Book map feed."
"3188250","3188770"," Right on. "
"3189030","3190290"," So I'm in some."
"3191050","3193890"," If I don't know if you got what you if you guys were tracking or not."
"3194930","3196170"," I'll revisit this. "
"3196270","3196490"," Okay."
"3196810","3198710"," So I'm going to go over this one more time."
"3198710","3206050"," I'm having some issues myself right now and I think I'm not sure if it's the feed. "
"3206610","3207430"," If it's the internet."
"3208950","3210270"," I might be having some lag."
"3210450","3213350"," I might be having some internet issues at the moment. "
"3216030","3218090"," I think it might be my internet connection."
"3218830","3220590"," I don't think it's my I don't think it's my computer."
"3221170","3222130"," I've got a banging computer. "
"3222470","3226070"," I think I think it has to do with the internet because you can see that my."
"3226890","3229430"," My feed is slowing down as well here."
"3232110","3235250"," But what I'm going to do is I'm going to sign off here and I'm going to call. "
"3235330","3236390"," My internet service provider."
"3236970","3238810"," Find out what the fuck is going on."
"3238830","3239450"," Sorry to swear. "
"3240350","3242730"," But I want to talk to you guys briefly about."
"3244370","3244990"," M you."
"3245130","3245350"," Okay. "
"3246730","3248070"," I want to show you M you right now."
"3249490","3251870"," I'm used heroin indicators off the chain."
"3251890","3252170"," Okay. "
"3252270","3252810"," It's off the charts."
"3253470","3255090"," The buyers are off the charts."
"3255150","3257850"," You've got three to one buyers to sellers on. "
"3257850","3259690"," You announced the dividend."
"3259970","3260170"," I guess."
"3261930","3266470"," My expectation would be that we break through and drive towards 100 at this point. "
"3267050","3271130"," The 100 calls for I think there were 40 cents or something a little bit ago."
"3271670","3273570"," They're now 47 cents."
"3274230","3279330"," So look into 100 sees expiring on 1231 on. "
"3279470","3279730"," You."
"3280630","3284250"," Looks like you've got some resistance right where we're at."
"3284250","3289610"," You've got a little bit more resistance at 97, but the price target is definitely 100 at this"
"3289610","3289870"," point. "
"3290210","3291970"," You guys seeing this down below here."
"3292990","3296650"," And I got to call my internet service provider and find out what the F is going on."
"3308200","3310080"," So let's talk about spy real quick. "
"3310360","3312960"," I'm not sure if you all of you guys have been tuned in since the beginning."
"3313500","3314780"," So on the spy."
"3315080","3315240"," Okay. "
"3315400","3319560"," This is the summation on the spy is that you've got the same."
"3321040","3322020"," Consolidation on spy."
"3323060","3323520"," Your. "
"3324760","3331120"," Support is that four seven or four seven five zero and four seven six point three nine."
"3331700","3337260"," And the sell the rip is four seven eight point seven six and four eight zero zero."
"3338580","3343020"," The longer that consolidation takes place on the spy, the weaker it'll become. "
"3343720","3350160"," So if we become let's say we don't trade up from now into Thursday, Friday, you'll see weakness"
"3350160","3351220"," heading into Friday."
"3358870","3360690"," You guys should have all that for spy."
"3365070","3367250"," Individual tickers that are moving this morning. "
"3367270","3369590"," The first one you should be looking at is M you."
"3375240","3379180"," Micron XLF look at XLF for one twenty two forty C."
"3385510","3389750"," XLF just had four orders come in for January twenty first."
"3418900","3420220"," Yes, this is really weird. "
"3420320","3425000"," I just had a Tesla call come in for twelve thirty one for eleven hundred."
"3426720","3432860"," See, but it's weird because you've got a half million dollar bet on eleven hundred C for Tesla."
"3433700","3440100"," Yet if we don't if so if Tesla doesn't expand with calls above eleven hundred. "
"3441160","3446480"," And on farther out dates like you need calls for like twelve hundred thirteen hundred fifteen"
"3446480","3450400"," hundred and all these calls that I'm seeing are within the."
"3454530","3459090"," The upper so if all the calls are coming in at eleven hundred, you're not going to get a push"
"3459090","3459650"," on Tesla."
"3460930","3461890"," Which is what we need. "
"3462010","3463670"," We need calls that are outside the money."
"3465270","3467390"," We're up at ten seventy five now in Tesla."
"3469250","3471950"," But still you really you want to be watching. "
"3473940","3479080"," You want you want to be watching calls on Tesla that are way way not in the money."
"3479340","3482820"," You want them outside the money and I'm not seeing those calls right now in Tesla."
"3483560","3489000"," So I'm not sure I would even be buying the dip in the money unless you're seeing more calls coming"
"3489000","3489320"," out. "
"3491320","3493700"," On outside the money and farther date it out."
"3493840","3494700"," We're just not seeing that."
"3494920","3502560"," All I'm seeing right now on on the spy on IWM on the cues on big tickers is a whole"
"3502560","3506800"," bunch of people buying in the money calls that are dated for the thirty first. "
"3507860","3509780"," And those calls will end up dying."
"3510580","3514580"," So you're being sold calls that are in the money that aren't going to produce anything."
"3514580","3523460"," And it's because people are uncertain as to what's going to take place leading up to the hedging on"
"3523460","3524920"," Friday and then Monday. "
"3526160","3531120"," So what what does that produce is it produces a pinned market that doesn't move."
"3531860","3535680"," And what will happen as we lead into Thursday Friday is panic."
"3536380","3538320"," You'll see people saying my calls aren't moving. "
"3538740","3543520"," They'll start to begin to sell their calls and the market will start to trail down looking below"
"3543520","3544140"," for support."
"3545820","3547940"," So it's kind of concerning."
"3549580","3551160"," It's somewhat concerning. "
"3552280","3559880"," You can see the Tesla hero the hero indicators going up because this is considered a bottom here at"
"3559880","3560600"," 1070."
"3561100","3563280"," But I'd still be concerned here with Tesla."
"3565800","3575520"," I'd be concerned with not the entire market, but I'd be concerned"
"3575520","3576320"," with. "
"3584660","3589100"," You've got everybody thought this is the interconnected thing we were talking about the other day."
"3589520","3594520"," But we're saying if everybody knows if everybody's trading apple and everybody's trading Tesla and"
"3594520","3596780"," everybody's training the same tickers the same ETFs."
"3597480","3601260"," And if everybody knows that it could be weakness on Friday. "
"3602540","3607460"," And everybody knows that we should only go to forty eight hundred then no one's going to be buying"
"3607460","3609560"," four ninety calls five hundred calls."
"3610140","3615060"," You've got all you have all these people out there saying we can't go to five hundred and then"
"3615060","3617320"," you've got everybody waiting on JPM heading into Friday."
"3617320","3620380"," What ends up happening is everyone's buying the same calls. "
"3620720","3625440"," Everyone's buying the same tickers and they're all in the money."
"3626720","3630760"," And so we get no movement and I'm looking at the flow right now and flow."
"3630760","3637840"," I'll go and there's some great flow on other tickers like XLF has some great flow and you have some"
"3637840","3645680"," great flow and video has by the dippers but it's nothing big. "
"3646760","3650300"," Walmart's got some interesting flow but Walmart moves kind of slow."
"3652180","3653800"," ASO has some flow on it."
"3654300","3662100"," But again you're talking about if everybody's buying calls for four seventy eight and four eighty"
"3662100","3663780"," we bought those like a week or two ago. "
"3664440","3671420"," So they're being unloaded on unsuspecting bulls right I think they're smarter than everybody else."
"3672020","3678960"," So the concern at this point would be that you'll trade will trade sideways into Friday and then"
"3678960","3680000"," panic will ensue."
"3680420","3684800"," You'll have front running of bulls saying you know what I'm just going to get out and you'll have a"
"3684800","3686420"," slow drift down into Friday. "
"3688850","3692250"," Maybe you guys think that they could run the right track with that or no."
"3704410","3709470"," Now see I you know we're going to have to do chase you're going to when you chase when you"
"3709470","3718350"," ask these questions you need to log off YouTube go back and watch just last night's video and what"
"3718350","3719390"," consolidation means."
"3719530","3725630"," What consolidation patterns are or you need to do your own search on YouTube at this point as to"
"3725630","3730330"," what consolidation is because it's a very basic understanding. "
"3730330","3732310"," It's very very straightforward."
"3733110","3739310"," When you consolidate when you trade sideways you have short consolidation periods they can last"
"3739310","3742530"," anywhere from one to let's say three five days."
"3743170","3748630"," And they're usually waiting for news or for a direction in the market right when you consolidate"
"3748630","3754750"," the longer that it takes to consolidate the more chances are that you trade lower does that make"
"3754750","3755030"," sense. "
"3755030","3760650"," So if you're if you're consolidating for a brief period of time you start to drift down but it's"
"3760650","3766750"," usually not that deep but as time passes the consolidation will turn into a downward movement."
"3767150","3772050"," Does everybody understand that concept that feel like I'm explaining the same concepts over and"
"3772050","3772290"," over."
"3776940","3781840"," I don't think that everybody understands what consolidation means or the impact of consolidation"
"3781840","3789350"," over time or what looking above and looking below means and then look at going the other direction. "
"3790150","3796210"," So like so if you're consolidating over a 15 minute period right you'll have a slight drop in a"
"3796210","3800290"," stock price let's say and then it'll move on higher right."
"3800890","3806310"," If in that consolidation phase you don't see volume kit what's low volume and then it kicks in"
"3806310","3807650"," you'll go higher right."
"3807990","3813570"," If you begin to consolidate for longer periods of time if you consolidate for one day two days"
"3813570","3817310"," three days four days five days right. "
"3817310","3824250"," It'll start to trail down does that make sense until you find actual support."
"3824250","3832420"," I don't think you guys don't think all you all you guys understand what consolidation is."
"3839040","3840900"," So it just rip off that pin. "
"3842520","3844400"," Let's put the spy back up."
"3850050","3851170"," Get rid of Tesla."
"3867780","3869880"," I think I got to write this stuff out for people. "
"3891100","3896380"," So when you consolidate so let's look at spy real quick if you guys open up on your own charts"
"3896380","3898220"," open up a five day chart right."
"3899700","3905780"," Do you guys have to do all of you have support resistance lines to trade the spy."
"3911340","3917760"," Maybe put out some numbers this morning we put out four seven five zero four seven what was this"
"3917760","3926320"," one that I put up four seven six three eight four seven eight point seven six and then four eight"
"3926320","3928580"," zero zero right. "
"3929060","3936480"," And if you were to look at five day chart on spy we came up on the 27th."
"3936480","3944470"," Then you have the 28th and today's the 29th when you come up and you do not automatically reject."
"3947180","3952180"," You're looking for then would then what would happen would be a consolidation phase right where"
"3952180","3953020"," you're observing sellers. "
"3954260","3958960"," You're looking for support to step in to make your next move up."
"3960700","3963800"," You want to see rejection one to three times."
"3964940","3968560"," If you don't break through on your third attempt we look below. "
"3970900","3971560"," Does that make sense."
"3972260","3976620"," And if you consolidate for too long you tend to trade down over time."
"3977300","3985360"," So so and then you've got as we move forward into Friday we're looking for buyers to step in with"
"3985360","3993360"," options contracts that are higher than in the money above 480 and not all expiring on the on Friday"
"3993360","3995180"," does that make sense to everybody out there. "
"3995180","3996960"," So you guys all tracking this."
"4003470","4005450"," Yeah it does make sense to some of you guys."
"4009640","4012560"," So on so my point to you out there is that. "
"4013520","4018320"," I point to out there is that if you're looking at the market so we've got runway right the runway"
"4018320","4026500"," began on Monday on the week the trading week and you've got everybody that knows that there can be"
"4026500","4028020"," weakness on Friday into Monday."
"4028020","4031220"," Everybody that knows that we can't go above 4800."
"4031840","4035680"," So everyone's buying inside inside the money or in the money calls. "
"4036320","4040740"," All these calls though we purchased a week or two ago remember when we bought all these calls."
"4041240","4047100"," We printed all this money in these calls and now they're being sold to top buyers."
"4047100","4054520"," When these top buyers shouldn't be buying for 78s and 480s they should be buying for 90s 5000s"
"4054520","4056700"," expanding the call wall above. "
"4057380","4063700"," But the flow is not coming in even this morning the flow is not coming in on the spy it's"
"4063700","4070620"," not coming in on Tesla above you need to have people believing we're going higher for the market to"
"4070620","4071180"," move higher."
"4072100","4077200"," So if you don't see that call flow coming in you end up trading sideways."
"4078320","4083720"," When you're trading sideways with no call code flow coming in what will happen is all these calls"
"4083720","4086100"," will expire worthless on Friday. "
"4087180","4093970"," I guess my I guess my spy my spy puts are probably printing right."
"4094370","4095130"," So look and see."
"4096090","4096970"," Hold on here. "
"4099109","4100330"," Nope they're not printing."
"4100930","4109390"," My spy puts are they were down they were down 5% yesterday or no no they're down so it"
"4109390","4110689"," says 1% today I think."
"4111350","4114750"," But my spy calls aren't I mean my spy puts aren't doing well at all. "
"4115569","4118229"," So everybody's screaming dumping this and dumping that."
"4119010","4120890"," So my spy head still isn't printing."
"4125109","4128510"," So there's still no movement anyone that's claiming there's movement right now. "
"4129569","4132990"," My spy puts are not printing so I don't know what anyone's talking about."
"4133490","4134609"," The moon is falling."
"4135229","4139670"," All this is right now is just sideways movement you guys often understand that. "
"4140950","4146880"," This is this is all this is right now just sideways movement."
"4157100","4157819"," There's no."
"4159240","4160060"," There's no doom"
"4160060","4170260"," and"
"4194870","4194870"," gloom. "
"4194870","4196590"," There really isn't much happening in the market."
"4198920","4201340"," And there is some concern on on Tesla."
"4202020","4205780"," You know if you're not seeing Tesla calls coming out that are that are much higher you're not going"
"4205780","4206120"," to see. "
"4210350","4212450"," You're not going to see movements in Tesla."
"4217260","4220580"," And there is some switching right now to puts on flow."
"4220580","4228200"," I'll go I'm seeing some Apple and spy puts BB BY INTC QQQs. "
"4230270","4234470"," I see some pins calls pins 1231 36 calls."
"4237770","4242730"," So if you're looking at hopefully my hopefully my spy puts a print the hedge of print."
"4248760","4250540"," So you've got so you've got. "
"4251380","4255260"," So already at Wednesday right so you have Monday Tuesday we're in Wednesday."
"4255360","4258720"," You're not seeing any call flow in the past three days that's outside the money."
"4258960","4260660"," There's nothing above. "
"4261540","4265660"," Like so there's no there's no calls above 480 on the spy."
"4266200","4268380"," You've got no outside the money calls on Tesla."
"4268380","4270060"," No outside the money calls on Apple. "
"4270800","4274460"," You've got everyone's playing the safe trade into Friday."
"4275380","4278240"," Top buying thinking they're going to get rich when in reality."
"4279100","4284740"," If you can't get people thinking we're going to go higher through New Year's and into the third. "
"4285320","4287540"," What will happen is the market will just trade sideways."
"4287600","4289260"," They'll say thank you for playing."
"4290180","4292700"," And we might we might trade down into Friday. "
"4293460","4295580"," And then you'd see a new a new week ahead."
"4295580","4301160"," You'd see people waiting for JPM to tell you which way the market is going by their collar."
"4303490","4307210"," And if you really wanted to I guess you could play some butterflies into. "
"4308150","4310610"," You can play a butterfly for today."
"4311250","4312050"," The expires today."
"4312870","4317010"," You could play a condor as well on the spy that would probably pretty well. "
"4317590","4319370"," Matter of fact I'm going to look at a condor."
"4319970","4323170"," See if I can get a get a butterfly to trade today."
"4323170","4329150"," I don't know if I can get one on a zero day. "
"4329350","4330990"," Even on Friday if I can get in one."
"4351240","4353660"," It's like I do is just try to butterfly and be done."
"4375680","4379880"," Yeah for iron condors right now four seventy two four seventy three. "
"4380420","4383680"," And a four eighty four eighty one is sixty two bucks."
"4384800","4388060"," And it pays thirty eight for an expiry of the thirty first."
"4388900","4393660"," You probably wouldn't want this better times of the data by them. "
"4393660","4397180"," Like opening the day the opening of the day is probably the best time to buy this."
"4397540","4402800"," But if you close it before the close on Friday might be able to capture twenty percent thirty"
"4402800","4403500"," percent on it."
"4405330","4407570"," I'd be afraid of a sell off in the Friday close. "
"4411820","4417380"," But the spread so wide you're talking you'd be in the money as long as we didn't trade below four"
"4417380","4418220"," seventy three."
"4418940","4424750"," Four seventy two something or trade above four eighty."
"4426070","4428570"," The way the way the column structure is right now. "
"4430390","4434370"," In the market it seems like everybody seems to know where we're going."
"4435630","4439890"," No one's willing to put any risk on the market going up and no one's willing to put any risk."
"4440570","4441790"," On the market going down. "
"4449990","4453530"," If you if you got if any of you guys have a flow out you can see that."
"4454350","4456110"," There are some tickers with."
"4456110","4460530"," With twenty twenty two calls like individual stuff. "
"4461010","4467110"," But if you're looking at all the all the all the popular tickers like Neo get twelve twenty twelve"
"4467110","4469150"," thirty one twenty eight call twenty eight sees."
"4469690","4473170"," Like I don't think those are going anywhere anything that's expiring in the thirty first."
"4474050","4475290"," If it's in the money. "
"4476430","4478190"," Have struggling to see it print."
"4486430","4490090"," I'm going to bet that the theta gang is going to take all of the all of the fomo buyers"
"4490090","4490550"," money."
"4499910","4500810"," Well you know what. "
"4505290","4508050"," Trying to think of where did I call hood at."
"4508630","4512630"," Did I call hood at I think I asked once would you like to see hood at."
"4513270","4515930"," I need to look look up what I what I."
"4517350","4518210"," Training you. "
"4523140","4533470"," I I charted"
"4533470","4534010"," out hood."
"4537210","4538270"," Not too long ago."
"4541210","4543670"," And I hope I didn't get I hope I didn't get rid of it. "
"4544830","4547230"," How deep I thought hood would go."
"4547230","4556560"," Oh look at that I did charted out."
"4557040","4557540"," Nice. "
"4559890","4561050"," I did chart out hood."
"4573660","4575820"," Makes you wonder if Robin Hood is going to go bankrupt."
"4577140","4578360"," They're training down. "
"4578640","4584120"," So I so my my bottom on Robin Hood my by zone and Robin Hood I had at ten dollars."
"4586500","4590520"," And my by the dip level is at fourteen ninety eight."
"4591160","4595180"," And it's now down to sixteen eighty five. "
"4596020","4600380"," So we're getting close to my by the dip on hood."
"4600700","4602080"," I just had it just broke through."
"4603400","4605860"," It's heading into any guys looking at hood right now. "
"4606320","4609260"," Let me check that back on you guys on YouTube."
"4618150","4619130"," Is mayhem here."
"4624790","4626750"," Okay, so let's you guys want to look at some stuff. "
"4627330","4628350"," Let's look at some stuff."
"4628690","4629330"," Look at spy."
"4630750","4634150"," You guys are all panicking on spy and we'll look at Tesla again. "
"4634150","4641860"," And we have more buyers and sellers still on spy right."
"4642560","4645000"," Just consuming buyers on the spy."
"4647740","4650380"," I'm in some calls from you to one hundred. "
"4650840","4654040"," And you guys want to see Tesla again."
"4658760","4659660"," So we'll look at Tesla."
"4684020","4686700"," It's going to take just a second for all this to come in. "
"4695110","4696450"," It's going to be just a minute here."
"4702980","4704640"," Are my spy puts printing."
"4706080","4708480"," So I charted hood out recently. "
"4708920","4713140"," I made a post on either made a video on hood or I made a post on hood."
"4714500","4716920"," And I think I posed the question."
"4718080","4720640"," Does hood trade down to. "
"4722140","4724760"," This hood trade down to ten bucks."
"4725600","4727660"," I think I asked if anyone believe that it would."
"4728240","4730640"," It just ricocheted. "
"4731860","4734200"," Just ricocheted off 1668."
"4735200","4738120"," It's my buy zone on hood is like 15 bucks."
"4739240","4741360"," So I don't know if we actually trade down to that 15. "
"4742200","4743520"," But I have to admit."
"4744260","4747000"," Even though I hate Robin Hood more with a passion."
"4749030","4750590"," It is starting to look juicy. "
"4757460","4759400"," It is starting to look juicy now."
"4761530","4763270"," I never thought I'd say that about Robin Hood."
"4764870","4766570"," I still want it at 10 bucks. "
"4766570","4774430"," Because you guys know that when they IPOed Robin Hood."
"4774890","4780610"," They were probably selling their first tier Robin Hood stock owners at like five bucks."
"4781170","4784830"," They're like six bucks and seven bucks and eight bucks and nine bucks. "
"4785850","4789050"," And they're probably all still under an agreement not to sell."
"4789810","4794650"," You know that Robin Hood you know with some kind of nasty dirty."
"4795890","4796930"," IPO program. "
"4800240","4802460"," Or maybe there's some news that we don't know."
"4802920","4806020"," I mean I want to personally I'd like to see it trade down to like a dollar."
"4807960","4810360"," But I am getting greedy down here. "
"4810940","4815400"," My I'm happy with owning Robin Hood price is ten dollars."
"4816100","4818200"," And my by the debt price is fifteen."
"4819420","4821160"," In red 1691. "
"4824550","4826130"," I might have to buy some Robin Hood."
"4826250","4828030"," We're coming close to be buying some Robin Hood."
"4828730","4831410"," Maybe out there thinking about buying Robin Hood right now. "
"4831990","4834250"," I know it's such a stock tone."
"4835370","4843290"," But I think it'll print in a couple of years fucking Robin Hood."
"4844330","4845710"," What a what a fire. "
"4848600","4850620"," Yeah my puts aren't printing on the spy."
"4851740","4855920"," If I'm going to guess about that if I'm going to guess about the market overall right now."
"4856540","4860080"," Is that there's okay so you got to think about the market. "
"4860080","4862000"," You got to think about trading week is like a runway."
"4862640","4866960"," You got a plane and you're trying to take off or you're trying to land right."
"4867840","4873760"," And this week the runway is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. "
"4875700","4879500"," You've got everybody that knows that we're not going over 480."
"4881640","4886860"," You've got probably got bears out there that are thinking that there's not enough runway so"
"4886860","4888400"," eventually it's going to sell off into Friday."
"4889000","4892080"," You've got bulls that know to expect the JPM collar trade. "
"4892480","4895300"," You can see the collars coming in."
"4895400","4898060"," You can see the hedging coming in the market."
"4898240","4900160"," There were some earlier hedging this week for 435. "
"4901040","4902180"," It was from a smaller bank."
"4903820","4909320"," But they're expecting the big banks to come out with their stuff on Thursday Friday."
"4909760","4911280"," We're already on Wednesday right now. "
"4911780","4916540"," There's no outside the money calls coming in on anything that's on anything that everybody trades"
"4916540","4918720"," past December 31st."
"4919140","4924040"," So everybody's like I'm going to buy inside the money dip buy on the Tesla right now or an apple"
"4924040","4926860"," right now or an Nvidia right now or whatever."
"4927640","4931380"," And so because you don't have that breadth right you're not going to have that breadth in the"
"4931380","4931720"," market. "
"4932460","4936380"," Everything that everybody's buying right now is just stuff that we bought last week."
"4936800","4939160"," So they're buying our calls back from us I guess."
"4940240","4941880"," So what does that mean for us. "
"4941880","4947760"," It means that you should probably probably be trading iron condors butterflies into Friday."
"4948520","4953900"," Or you should have been trading them on Monday or even yesterday for an expiration of today."
"4955320","4960920"," And what will happen is this is if you let's say we had if we had a bit in the"
"4960920","4962600"," market we would go up this week. "
"4963260","4965700"," And probably sell off into Thursday Friday."
"4965700","4971820"," But due to everyone and their sister knowing what they what where the levels are."
"4972200","4976420"," My assumption is that you'll just get we'll just get front run with sellers. "
"4976780","4978900"," You'll just get a panic that'll start earlier than Friday."
"4979200","4983600"," They'll probably begin at some point later today into Thursday Friday."
"4986330","4990070"," And that would mean that you've got too many calls to sell to get rid of. "
"4990470","4992250"," I can look at the options chain right now."
"4992470","4996450"," I bet there's I bet if I look at the call structure for spy it's stupid."
"4996450","5006320"," Yeah, you've got 91,000 for"
"5006320","5007700"," 78 C's. "
"5008620","5015100"," For today for Thursday you've got 50,000 for 80 C's."
"5024630","5025450"," It's kind of funny."
"5027660","5028060"," To be honest. "
"5049370","5050150"," You've got flow."
"5050330","5051830"," I'll go is not really showing much."
"5053030","5056770"," There's just everything's in the money everything expires this week. "
"5071390","5075970"," There's some nice January 21st American Airlines AAL puts at 18."
"5078940","5083580"," Food to FUTU has some January 21st 30 P."
"5087070","5088150"," That's kind of small."
"5088330","5090190"," It's too small for me to trade. "
"5100240","5103940"," Everything's 1231 and like all the other big tickers that you guys like."
"5104420","5105180"," I like to trade."
"5105880","5108580"," It's all like it's all December 31st stuff. "
"5110580","5113360"," So you end up getting as you become range bound."
"5120200","5124580"," Into Friday and the market makers, the dealers, they're just going to they're going to murder all"
"5124580","5126040"," these calls into Friday."
"5127600","5129160"," Check out what you guys are saying on YouTube. "
"5132240","5134520"," It's exactly my resistance to down trend levels."
"5135280","5136540"," It's my name is Robin Hood name."
"5138850","5140970"," Shamed by juicy hood, juicy turd. "
"5141750","5142310"," What up, homie?"
"5142570","5143510"," Hey, Mark, it's a mayhem."
"5143790","5144070"," How are you?"
"5146550","5147190"," So markets and mayhem."
"5147550","5148590"," Hopefully you can hear all this. "
"5148770","5149930"," Good to see you in the feed."
"5150740","5151270"," Hey, buddy."
"5151470","5153410"," This morning, this is where we're watching. "
"5153750","5155770"," So we're watching MU this morning."
"5156290","5157310"," It had some early movement."
"5157910","5159790"," There really wasn't much resistance above. "
"5161110","5164690"," You can see that the bulls are consuming each other out here."
"5165890","5166910"," There's no rail."
"5167250","5170770"," There's no bid in the market to go any higher than. "
"5172330","5174110"," Directed at specific tickers."
"5174610","5175770"," So you're not seeing like."
"5176690","5183290"," You're not seeing other than individual tickers and some bid coming into tickers into next year. "
"5184170","5187130"," When you look at the indexes, everybody is."
"5188890","5190870"," The indexes and the big tickers."
"5191010","5196830"," Everybody's buying in the money calls that expire Friday, which, as you know, offers no expansion. "
"5198110","5200970"," To the market and no one's buying puts either."
"5203110","5205970"," So there's no put buying and there's just call buying in the money."
"5205970","5215860"," I think I love"
"5215860","5216280"," you guys. "
"5219010","5219730"," Good to see."

"5227550","5229130"," So I've got the Tesla feed up for you right now."
"5229370","5231550"," You guys should be concerned on this hero indicator. "
"5232190","5233510"," Do you guys see this hero indicator?"
"5236030","5238270"," It's at minus 10, five, four, zero."
"5238650","5240130"," That's pretty negative on Tesla."
"5241430","5241570"," Okay. "
"5242230","5244050"," Now it needs to be much higher than this."
"5244630","5246230"," And you still have substantial self."
"5246230","5246430"," Yeah. "
"5246530","5246610"," Yeah."
