"2060","2980"," Let's see."
"15960","18000"," See if we're back on again."
"19240","20780"," Back on again. "
"24180","32360"," It's funny, I was just talking about how I just signed up for fiber."
"39100","40800"," Just signed up."
"41620","42460"," Save. "
"47470","47890"," Okay."
"51950","53310"," Oh, and the rude again."
"57710","58430"," Yeah, it's funny. "
"58590","60230"," I was just, I see some of your here."
"60450","60850"," You know, it's funny."
"61030","63349"," I was just talking to. "
"65410","70950"," You guys a few minutes ago, I now have fiber available to me."
"72370","74730"," So the difference with."
"78600","80940"," Oh, I got something I got to do here in the background. "
"84660","85920"," Yes, yeah."
"88020","90320"," Uh, one of the things that."
"91000","91840"," Drivers. "
"93880","96620"," That sucks about Xfinity is."
"98360","100840"," The choke upload."
"105520","109220"," Not choke, but it's not really truly fiber. "
"109760","112860"," You don't get the same, uh, clinical upload speeds."
"113500","114360"," Yeah, I'm back."
"114920","116000"," I still got you guys covered here. "
"116520","117420"," Then go nowhere."
"120060","124660"," But, uh, Xfinity internet really sucks balls."
"127220","129160"," Uh, it's really bad. "
"129160","134710"," A couple of things I got to do."
"139040","140380"," Share, click that."
"146020","146720"," Hold on here. "
"146860","147740"," A couple of things I got to do here."
"155120","155720"," Copy that."
"170700","174960"," And, uh, I went, maybe they were listening in when I said that when I, when I started talking,"
"175260","177920"," everybody started talking about, uh, I'm going to switch to fiber. "
"179180","180720"," They've got maybe they were listening."
"182440","185540"," And they're like, we're just going to cut your stream off right now."
"188370","189970"," We're going to kick you right in the teeth. "
"194600","196820"," See, uh, post that."
"197740","198180"," Okay."
"203080","205960"," Um, close that up, close that up. "
"208680","211380"," Make sure you get all this back up and running here just fine."
"213100","213540"," Sweet."
"213740","214500"," We're back on again. "
"215420","216100"," Yeah, it's weird."
"216280","224020"," I got up for, uh, got to take a leak and then, uh, it came back downstairs to change."
"224120","225220"," I was going to actually change. "
"226380","228880"," Uh, a scroller here that says I'm on break."
"232460","233980"," Uh, still bleeding right now."
"235640","237060"," The market's still bleeding. "
"238400","239680"," So I'm switching to fiber."
"241540","243360"," It's, uh, it's less expensive."
"246320","251040"," It gets, uh, the matching upload speeds, which is going to make a huge difference. "
"252320","253020"," It's a gig."
"253820","254960"," So I can't complain."
"256120","256920"," Less expensive. "
"257519","258040"," Say it again."
"260220","261400"," Which is always welcome."
"261720","265060"," And then I can, I can tell it's funny to go to, uh, can't swear. "
"265280","266440"," I'm trying not to swear as much."
"266440","269580"," But you guys know what I'm going to tell you, XFINITY, right?"
"270920","272580"," Here are the bane of my existence."
"273720","282090"," Always have been, you know, VIX is just kind of messing around right now. "
"282170","283310"," It's not really doing anything."
"284910","285550"," It's blow."
"285730","286690"," It's one in five minutes. "
"287670","291650"," Uh, this could lead to a relief rally here right now."
"291830","294810"," So if you are, so I'm long, uh, puts right now."
"295790","297650"," I'm thinking about closing them out. "
"297650","302370"," I'm at 98 cents right now and puts this looks like garbage."
"304850","307910"," Uh, one minute's looking like it's going to go down."
"308570","312030"," It's like right here just looking at this without knowing anything in the background. "
"312350","313410"," This looks kind of bearish."
"316070","319910"," I mean, I really want us to get down to like 410, 408."
"320810","322790"," Any of these targets down below here. "
"325940","327060"," Even 41066."
"327640","330220"," Like just give me a race to move."
"330220","331760"," This isn't even the move. "
"338380","340000"," You know, this isn't even the move from yesterday."
"340440","342640"," So this, this, this, uh, H line right here."
"344140","346060"," This is just the low from yesterday. "
"347240","351440"," Like, uh, or yesterday Friday before we closed the day."
"352340","354660"," This is, uh, the low of the day."
"355940","359220"," So this is the previous low, I guess on Friday. "
"359500","360680"," This is the low of Friday."
"363540","369620"," Um, we're not asking for too much here."
"375150","378370"," So I'd like to close these puts out if possible at some point. "
"385760","387920"," Bears haven't had much follow through, right?"
"388400","389960"," You can see that this is supportive."
"390320","397460"," Even if we go down here, if we go down here, go down here, go down a 408, you can"
"397460","399600"," see the market's still very supportive here."
"399940","403680"," So I would temper your expectations if you're a bear. "
"410100","412700"," You know, not a trend down day in any way, shape or form."
"421720","423980"," So if you wanted to close your puts there, I don't blame you."
"423980","427920"," Uh, the market is supportive. "
"436640","438500"," Hey, uh, cheap here."
"438700","440200"," Thank you very much for supporting the channel."
"440200","440940"," I appreciate it. "
"443040","448140"," I try to find, uh, if you, if you support directly through PayPal, every Friday, I try to give a"
"448140","448900"," shout out to you guys."
"465050","467030"," Probably going to get a decent squeeze out of this."
"467150","483600"," If you want to get some calls, I'm flat"
"483600","484160"," right now. "
"490720","505540"," If you're looking for the next roll over, look for"
"505540","507320"," it back on that hourly trigger again."
"512929","514169"," Somewhere up in here."
"519120","522140"," We're going to get long on some puts that somewhere up in here. "
"531130","532650"," Just dog day trading."
"548320","554200"," Kind of hoping here that we get this bigger move down right in here."
"554440","555220"," Somewhere right in here. "
"565770","567550"," I still want to make head sodas."
"568270","569230"," I'm going to get in trouble for that."
"570930","575220"," It tastes good though. "
"577580","579000"," I don't drink soda."
"579240","580860"," That's like pure sugar."
"581580","589310"," Oh, that's fire. "
"600640","603680"," We'll take a look at some, uh, reports going on."
"603780","606520"," We've got more bank reports after the close today."
"606980","608660"," We've got JB Hunt reporting. "
"610380","614340"," We have some stuff to talk about a bunch of stuff we haven't talked about yet."
"617740","619440"," I'm going to post something for you."
"619440","621640"," I'm going to put a bunch of talk about here. "
"621840","624300"," I'm going to get a bunch of stuff out there."
"637270","642450"," Now, if you like to produce content, I have something for you."
"643370","647230"," If you want to seem like you're, you know what you're doing. "
"649970","651850"," Let me see if I can find this here."
"674580","675840"," I can't complain here too."
"675980","677500"," This is like 100% trade for me. "
"677720","679660"," Or close to, I think it's like an 80% trade."
"679660","683480"," I can't complain here."
"691350","693270"," What am I looking for here?"
"694090","699890"," Why is it not coming up?"
"713070","713950"," Right here. "
"714150","716590"," So squeezing right now."
"721380","724360"," So I'm going to post a link for you guys."
"727560","729040"," With a caveat here. "
"729500","729920"," So."
"730800","731740"," Hey, biggie."
"731820","732240"," Thanks, man. "
"733520","734400"," Appreciate it, brother."
"739180","742420"," I'm going to post the link for you guys to read through here."
"745300","749440"," Now I'm going to, I'm going to preface this and I'm going to tell you. "
"750740","753240"," There's 900 comments in that post."
"755440","762060"," What is the key in that post is that I just gave to you."
"762140","763600"," Open that up in a screener at home or something. "
"764440","772440"," What's key in that post is you have a lot of people commenting that work in the film and television"
"772440","773200"," industry."
"774880","780500"," And so this isn't like you and I saying, yeah, TV shows suck and movies suck."
"781440","785000"," These are below the line. "
"787430","790890"," Production staff commenting on the union."
"791830","795490"," The writers guild of Hollywood of California."
"796410","798530"," And they are openly discussing. "
"799790","801190"," The writers strike."
"802250","805190"," And it's impact on film and TV."
"806010","812610"," And there's some neat stuff in there too about the rise of social media streaming services. "
"813250","817590"," Why TV show seasons are canceled after season two."
"818330","819490"," And then also."
"820890","821930"," Stuff like that. "
"822030","824270"," That's all cool stuff, but the really neat stuff."
"824790","826130"," Has to do with."
"828190","828830"," Seasonally. "
"830530","832250"," For seasonally speaking."
"833450","839070"," A lot of movie filming and a lot of movies and TV shows are the season is ending right now."
"840170","841490"," And with discussion. "
"842330","844270"," Discussion taking place on."
"847790","850190"," Or there's discussion taking place on."
"850990","852250"," That's multi fold. "
"854150","855630"," It talks about."
"856590","863550"," How there are no new productions starting for TV or movies like they would normally begin a new"
"863550","866150"," season or starting or planning a new season."
"866690","869710"," That a lot of writers and other. "
"870870","874610"," Services are don't have work lined up for the summertime."
"875030","877850"," That a lot of productions are not starting."
"878530","879530"," We might have a."
"879690","881150"," A dearth at some point. "
"881630","882130"," We're not a dirty."
"883350","889310"," Now we had less production movie TV show production during COVID could be entering that again and"
"889310","890430"," they discuss historically."
"891070","893370"," That there was one comment talking about how. "
"894110","898070"," There used to be 10 soap operas on TV that went down a four or five during the last writer"
"898070","898490"," strike."
"898990","902830"," They also talk about the timing of the last writer strike versus the timing."
"903270","904390"," This writing strike. "
"908840","914460"," That they're not Hollywood is doing well right now in terms of timing the strike."
"915020","915960"," But it does discuss."
"916860","918300"," Over time what will happen. "
"918960","919800"," We'll see it."
"919980","921320"," We'll see a time period."
"921980","923840"," And movie and TV production will be a lag. "
"924060","926500"," We will be missing movies TV shows."
"928220","931120"," Coming to you to consume."
"933060","935340"," And there was also discussion if other. "
"936040","938160"," Services would go on strike with the writers."
"939200","940920"," But it might be something worth."
"942080","945500"," Looking back on the last writer strike that we had. "
"946460","952760"," And it's impact on the stock market with TV companies right like time of streaming companies."
"953760","960220"," You're talking about like the paramount and Hulu and Apple and Netflix and."
"961620","965000"," And NBC ABC CBS Fox. "
"967560","972480"," And then movie movie publicly traded movie companies so."
"973320","974200"," Disney."
"974940","980880"," And you could probably work out some kind of a I haven't done it yet. "
"980880","983780"," So I'm going to give it to you guys if you want to do it on your own."
"985520","987680"," And you can you want to time it with."
"988860","992040"," When it's actually going to impact when you're going to see this. "
"992800","994120"," The point here would be."
"994760","997840"," Maybe in the next three months you're not going to if there's a strike."
"998400","999240"," And the next. "
"1006400","1008300"," Hey thanks and I appreciate it."
"1010220","1011600"," I appreciate that Anna."
"1013140","1015880"," Anna just said a cap about a half an hour ago. "
"1015880","1021180"," I went into the discord asked in the education section got answers and help I needed."
"1021700","1023300"," And some very good guidance."
"1023319","1024440"," This is the best platform. "
"1024760","1026460"," Thanks cap and your great team of mods."
"1027140","1030640"," I have to give all that credit to the moderators there putting out."
"1031180","1032880"," A ton of time. "
"1034839","1038200"," Yeah when I started trash and Comcast they were like they were like."
"1039000","1039359"," Delete."
"1043960","1044400"," Thanks. "
"1044599","1044920"," Molly."
"1049900","1051380"," I'm looking for another role up here."
"1055460","1057560"," I'm looking for a role or so we're not done going down. "
"1059760","1061220"," My view we're not done going down."
"1061660","1064860"," The seller is going to step in somewhere in here."
"1065920","1067560"," They're not they're not far behind. "
"1067760","1069900"," They're like right here right here right here."
"1072300","1073580"," Not so much right here."
"1074520","1075880"," But they are up here somewhere. "
"1084000","1088420"," My point though is you should it's it's a fascinating read on its own."
"1088420","1093100"," So if you want to know why TV sucks and movies suck."
"1093980","1097020"," There is some truthfulness. "
"1099720","1103780"," Exposed in that in that that post that I just posted to you."
"1105280","1106700"," Which is that."
"1107800","1112140"," Streaming services like Netflix are eating the lunch. "
"1113240","1116380"," Prime broadcasting broadcast TV."
"1117160","1117880"," And movies."
"1119900","1126100"," Appetites from consumers or consumers are changing. "
"1127520","1129640"," Due to the last writing strike."
"1132180","1136240"," Where you'd have people that consumed let's say state time soap operas and mass."
"1136240","1140220"," They don't anymore right they they got reduced to four four soap operas. "
"1140300","1141900"," And now it could get even worse."
"1143220","1146680"," They also these major content providers also."
"1147780","1149940"," Didn't pay any mind to YouTube. "
"1150480","1151080"," TikTok."
"1152030","1152800"," What have you."
"1153120","1156740"," And so you just have the tastes people's taste and then you've had COVID of course. "
"1157060","1157760"," Everybody's at home."
"1159980","1162100"," So people's tastes are changing."
"1162100","1168660"," And you get writers that leave you have content creators that create their own make their own"
"1168660","1170120"," studios make a lot of money. "
"1171300","1174560"," Able to create content of quality content that's out there."
"1176660","1182600"," Believe it or not you'll see reviewers writers actual writers producing their own content on"
"1182600","1183300"," YouTube now right."
"1184700","1187940"," So you have a paradigm will shift going on. "
"1189560","1191620"," In this end in all of this."
"1193180","1200040"," And there's some brevity and truthfulness being told by the by the below the line workers in that"
"1200040","1202720"," in that post that I just get linked to you."
"1202840","1206240"," So fascinating read all around but then the implications. "
"1208100","1209300"," And how that impacts."
"1210080","1214720"," A whole bunch of stuff right whole bunch of how you what you consume out there who's in control of"
"1214720","1215320"," what you consume."
"1216540","1222940"," It's impact on all these publicly traded companies and how they'll be valued as time goes on. "
"1224600","1226060"," And how do they make their money."
"1227100","1228940"," Are they able to make any more money."
"1230260","1234160"," So anyways it could be a fascinating read that could lead to. "
"1238480","1238920"," Possibly."
"1242310","1245890"," A degradation of a lot of stocks that you are beloved to you."
"1253010","1254850"," Yeah they're talking about a I too. "
"1255090","1257830"," They talked about a I in that in that post as well."
"1259250","1264130"," I forget who it was somewhat was a drink that was talking about a I was all pissed off because"
"1264130","1265770"," a is being created it was kind of."
"1266030","1268590"," That's another fact that leads into the conversation I was reading. "
"1269230","1269930"," I read."
"1271310","1276550"," Three discussions this weekend about a I and I found it fascinating because."
"1277750","1278510"," You've got. "
"1279510","1281210"," It reminds me of."
"1282250","1283150"," I'll be honest."
"1283510","1290190"," It reminds me of a teenage boy trying to get laid for the first time and not use a rubber. "
"1291290","1296390"," That's what it reminds me of because you've got some people being honest they're like."
"1297210","1302330"," Yeah I'm using a I'm using chat all the time chat GPD using it to write scripts that was in"
"1302330","1302770"," that stuff."
"1304310","1307930"," So I have some a writer was like I have a bunch of dead scripts. "
"1309170","1314210"," That I I'm not making any any for progress on some feeding them into."
"1314870","1318390"," Chat GPD GPT with with structure."
"1319550","1321130"," With mathematical equations. "
"1322290","1327630"," And it's spitting out a better script to me that I then work on some more and it's becoming a"
"1327630","1328830"," better script that's scary."
"1330470","1332810"," That's scary that just opens a bunch of complications."
"1332910","1340410"," Then I was reading some a story from actual people that are using chat GPT to write essays. "
"1341070","1342710"," They're like fuck yeah I'm using it all the time."
"1342710","1345850"," It gives me good structure I can then break it there."
"1345970","1349390"," People are like well just repeats itself if you ask it for a thousand word essay. "
"1350050","1356670"," Yeah but if you only ask it for for for for for an outline and then you actually ask chat"
"1356670","1357130"," GPD."
"1358030","1361890"," Smaller and smaller ideas within that larger outline."
"1362230","1363670"," It actually does work quite well. "
"1364910","1369030"," How I relate this back to any young boy trying to get laid for the first time is."
"1369770","1378030"," Then I read another discussion where someone was like jet jet GPD sucks and it'll never do what"
"1378030","1380490"," it's supposed to do or it's not quite there yet."
"1381270","1386370"," And I'm like oh this is like this is like defending something that you've never had before because"
"1386370","1391150"," I'm like yeah a year ago you didn't have access to this right three years ago it was just being"
"1391150","1391570"," discussed. "
"1392550","1397670"," The truth is it is being used quite well right now and there's a argument that you know no one's"
"1397670","1401310"," using it in no one's using it with success and there's all these antidotes."
"1402170","1404750"," The truth is it's being used everywhere right now."
"1405710","1409870"," And some people are more successful than others and how they're using it right now. "
"1410870","1416470"," And you already see voices deep fake voices deep fake videos."
"1419450","1422870"," So this stuff will move really fast we know that right."
"1423390","1429510"," We know it's going to move faster than any argument against it being implemented. "
"1431030","1435530"," So that's what I mean is like baby is baby it's fine but you don't need to work on them"
"1435530","1439910"," baby we can we don't need that we should try to try sex we only have one life."
"1440530","1445010"," Like all this argument is like reminds me I'm like an 18 year old kid with first girlfriend."
"1446970","1448950"," It's not that bad nothing bad could happen. "
"1457990","1458390"," Yeah."
"1464540","1465620"," Yeah I agree with that winky."
"1477380","1483660"," You know it's funny I went into chat GPT and I was fucking with him one day and I was"
"1483660","1488800"," like I'm just gonna I'm like I'm just gonna open a bunch of accounts and ask who's the best trainer"
"1488800","1491820"," ever and it's Kevin Jim James and just try to teach him that. "
"1493420","1497060"," Because it's like I can't answer that I was like who's the best trainer ever and he couldn't give"
"1497060","1498500"," me an answer or she whoever it is."
"1499080","1501700"," I was like maybe I can just fucking steam roll this thing."
"1503360","1505280"," I'm assuming companies are doing that. "
"1506020","1511900"," If I was Coca-Cola I'd be like how do I find out how to make chat GPT say the"
"1511900","1515460"," best soda ever is Coke or Budweiser whoever."
"1518380","1522080"," How do you steam roll AI to give you a preference."
"1530310","1532470"," So that discussion's in there I think it's fascinating. "
"1541000","1547140"," Yeah the funniest part too about this whole thing is I guess maybe I'm not describing it well"
"1547140","1547360"," enough."
"1548200","1554320"," It's hilarious to see like there's like this there's like there's like there's people out there"
"1554320","1555120"," that know better."
"1555120","1563580"," They're like they're like a chat GPT and AI in general is being used to game the system. "
"1565260","1573040"," And there's a there's a huge group of people like a cacophony."
"1573320","1576400"," I'm assuming some of this is paid for."
"1577080","1583580"," But there's a huge cacophony of arguments saying no it's not that bad. "
"1583580","1585060"," This is the 18 year old boy."
"1585940","1587600"," It's never going to be like that."
"1587980","1589000"," Everything's going to be fine. "
"1589280","1593980"," There's even people out there like why should there was one guy yesterday who said well why"
"1593980","1594840"," shouldn't we use it."
"1595720","1597520"," It only make things better right."
"1600420","1610340"," And I disagree with that 100% if you are out there and you're like if you're not a good"
"1610340","1614660"," writer and you're using chat GPT to make you a good writer. "
"1615680","1618080"," What it removes is serendipity."
"1619700","1625420"," And that is what a key thing about any AI general AI."
"1627260","1630220"," Serendipity is a fascinating thing. "
"1631420","1636080"," And it only humans have access to serendipity."
"1636080","1643620"," And that's part of the reason why AI is being released to you so that it can experience"
"1643620","1645120"," serendipity."
"1646040","1654320"," So the idea here is as twofold would be AI only has access to the information that's provided to"
"1654320","1654500"," it. "
"1654760","1661420"," It does not have access to a library somewhere with a book that has never been uploaded to the"
"1661420","1661760"," internet."
"1661760","1669000"," It is hoping and begging or the writers of these programs are hoping and begging that someone out"
"1669000","1676520"," there has read this book that's never been transcribed to the internet so that someone will tell"
"1676520","1678320"," that that AI about that book."
"1679480","1681200"," That's one part of serendipity. "
"1681620","1690340"," The second part of serendipity would be let's say I go to a library and I'm looking up the color"
"1690340","1690740"," red."
"1691920","1698600"," And the librarian introduces something to me like hey you might be looking up the color red but if"
"1698600","1700820"," you ever looked up the sound of red."
"1701840","1703900"," Not the color but the sound of red. "
"1705860","1709700"," I stumbled upon this down the road right at serendipity."
"1710380","1716460"," Maybe that person went to the library to look up the color red because of course the information on"
"1716460","1717480"," the internet is topical."
"1718940","1728820"," So you travel to England and they have all the best books from the 1300s about the color"
"1728820","1729120"," red. "
"1729300","1739250"," So you go there and you take a wrong turn and you wind up in this book section that's"
"1739250","1740710"," next to the color red section."
"1741610","1747850"," You find some other book that it has gives you an epiphany to talk about a different track than the"
"1747850","1748350"," color red."
"1748710","1749210"," Does that make sense?"
"1750330","1756850"," And then you start to apply the color red to the sound of red and that's serendipity. "
"1758390","1762370"," Let's say you're researching the color red and you get into a car accident or you're walking across"
"1762370","1764730"," the street from that library and you get run over but you live."
"1764730","1770430"," And you start you get on a different path in the color red though that's all serendipitous moments"
"1770430","1779730"," that AI can't do and it's only access to that is right currently is for"
"1779730","1782950"," you to input that information to it."
"1784250","1788810"," And that is one of the key ways and reasons that makes the human race fascinating. "
"1789990","1799760"," How we discover things that we normally might not discover that some of the beauty of art right"
"1799760","1807170"," some of the beauty of science is what we trip and fall into by mistake."
"1807450","1812230"," That doesn't mean you don't need math or high math or math can't figure a lot of this stuff out."
"1812770","1815670"," But some of this stuff can't be figured out without experience. "
"1818050","1819510"," Experience is key here."
"1820510","1825590"," And so there could be a dearth of fake intelligence."
"1828250","1836430"," Where it's good enough but it isn't still isn't peak right so you have a dearth of a lot of"
"1836430","1839050"," writers out there's let's say they're writing scripts for TV. "
"1840750","1846230"," You know uniqueness there's like uniqueness to the human form there's uniqueness to the human"
"1846230","1846590"," voice."
"1847590","1850170"," Like singers like Drake was talking about right."
"1854130","1857890"," It's interesting that that conversation I was reading about and it's like. "
"1858490","1862110"," You know if you go out there if you if you like music and you go to some of the"
"1862110","1862970"," great music capitals."
"1863530","1870710"," And you listen to music that's not produced that you consume on Apple or your local radio station."
"1871990","1876430"," You'll find vast different music out there right like a whole swath of it. "
"1881060","1885100"," Whereas like you know like AI is going to kind of you know it's going to kind of be the"
"1885100","1886540"," same shit over and over again."
"1890290","1891870"," There's no serendipity to it."
"1901600","1903680"," Yeah I don't think it's not that it doesn't help you. "
"1904100","1906980"," I don't I'm not trying to like."
"1908100","1909160"," Be like yeah."
"1909520","1910640"," TPT sucks. "
"1910800","1915300"," I think it's there as a good touch and a good way to help teach you stuff and all that"
"1915300","1915600"," but."
"1916620","1918160"," There is an entire class."
"1921100","1928540"," Of higher profits an entire class of consume more an entire class of this is the answer. "
"1929900","1931740"," There's an entire class of randomness."
"1933800","1935260"," That can't account for."
"1940840","1941440"," Yeah. "
"1961760","1965140"," Yeah David G is saying that's that's a very fair point."
"1965900","1968640"," To make AI better than a fish show no chance."
"1969500","1973720"," I mean what it would take for that to happen David would be some some. "
"1974840","1978220"," Crazy changes right to chat to be able to create that."
"1978760","1983420"," When you're at a fish show live any of you ever if you guys are bent to like any kind"
"1983420","1989080"," of real concert I guess would not just be fish but some concerts more prevalent than others where"
"1989080","1995080"," you have the feeling of that moment right just the right time right place right moment."
"1996860","2003260"," It's like when Prince is a good example he was at a Super Bowl and it started to rain. "
"2004060","2009680"," As he was singing purple rain right he could have electrocuted himself to death and it was like"
"2009680","2011320"," right moment right time."
"2011900","2017580"," Took into all this stuff it's just like it's like anything right right song right time right place."
"2020420","2025020"," And it made a difference it was it made an impact and fishes like that when you go to a"
"2025020","2025460"," fish show. "
"2027320","2030820"," White stripes some of their most early performances same thing."
"2031840","2036200"," The right feel of something right if you're inside if you're like came at this."
"2036420","2041060"," I met a festival in this right moment right time of the day or night. "
"2043830","2049090"," And you have this explosive moment of emotion and you get the band and the singer and they're all"
"2049090","2052929"," in the same same wavelength as people that are consuming that stuff."
"2053230","2059150"," You can't replicate that stuff can you can't be replicated moment the Berlin wall came down the"
"2059150","2060909"," moment where World War two ended."
"2061929","2070429"," That can't be replicated you can't make you can't like you know those moments in history. "
"2071530","2076469"," Nine eleven when that when the moment of that the nine eleven happened I'll never forget it for the"
"2076469","2077090"," rest of my life."
"2078449","2080030"," Never forget it for the rest of my life."
"2081070","2084790"," How do you relate that to chat chat GPT you really can't. "
"2126890","2132090"," Yeah, see that's the I still have a problem with that though too like the chat GPT it says they"
"2132090","2133570"," say it's just facts but."
"2135150","2136330"," Facts are weird."
"2137690","2142830"," If any of you out there are scientists if anybody's watch this program right now would death could"
"2142830","2144630"," probably definitely chime in. "
"2145550","2148230"," You're like your core understanding of mathematics."
"2149850","2155130"," Anything actually like you think you know something about something that you know people are like"
"2155130","2160410"," people are like hey the scientists will be able to explain this better than I can but."
"2162330","2166550"," Oftentimes someone with a bachelor's degree will say something like. "
"2167330","2173890"," Remember when we were told in school that the the pilgrims discovered America and then we found out"
"2173890","2174610"," that wasn't true."
"2174610","2181050"," Or that Christopher Columbus didn't discover America right and I know that even I know that but"
"2181050","2183950"," then you start to go higher in education levels."
"2184690","2190210"," And you find out that that's not true this but this isn't true this isn't true this isn't true and"
"2190210","2190930"," this isn't true. "
"2191970","2194790"," So then again it's what is facts if chat GPT."
"2196230","2198750"," Has some bias towards what you can understand."
"2201230","2207010"," It isn't going to try to say well I mean what what's the decision making in terms of what's a"
"2207010","2208230"," fact and what's not a fact. "
"2210500","2217720"," Is my question if chat GPT was only going to tell you facts then likely you wouldn't understand"
"2217720","2219160"," most of those facts."
"2220760","2226020"," Without an IQ of like 130 likely you wouldn't understand them."
"2234810","2237350"," Yeah I saw MS Cranken bro. "
"2238010","2241570"," I saw MS Cranken I didn't see BAC Cranken but I did see MS Cranken."
"2242210","2243450"," I saw Cranken early this morning."
"2245650","2247130"," Congrats on that MS trade. "
"2256520","2259020"," Yeah chat GPT is biased 100% it is."
"2260560","2264480"," And not only that the people that are behind it I would want to."
"2264660","2271400"," You can't say that you're not going to introduce the human experience into preference for chat GPT"
"2271400","2271880"," either. "
"2273320","2283140"," You can't tell me ever that if I created an AI that I wouldn't try to insert something"
"2283140","2284220"," to my own benefit."
"2286420","2288620"," That always comes out down the road."
"2290600","2293840"," I'm going to also bet that if you I'm going to also bet that if you were to look at"
"2293840","2299880"," any AI coming out of a different country is going to have its own biases 100%. "
"2302540","2312400"," Building a base now"
"2312400","2313760"," on Z Spy."
"2316360","2319440"," If you're a bear out there you like this isn't no base."
"2320160","2321480"," We're going to roll this over here. "
"2324300","2325000"," See that roll."
"2326420","2327480"," Bears see it."
"2337250","2338750"," Bears just waiting right now. "
"2339850","2341450"," They want that bloodbath to start."
"2342970","2344070"," See it right there."
"2351280","2352880"," Here comes the blood. "
"2354360","2356280"," There comes the blood baby."
"2357880","2359120"," Make it rain."
"2361860","2363480"," Make it rain bears. "
"2376430","2379270"," It's it's it's logic to you."
"2379930","2381150"," Is my point."
"2384210","2389530"," You should ask a scientist ask anyone with a much higher like degree than yourself. "
"2390290","2393110"," What its understanding of topics are."
"2395090","2398070"," It's your impression that it's your impression is that it's logical."
"2446280","2452480"," Someone who speaks on this is very well is I think the guy from the founder of Wired talked about"
"2452480","2453040"," this extensively. "
"2477700","2479320"," We've got a scientist on Twitch."
"2488240","2494660"," And also related to another great way to relate this would be if you're an RN in a hospital you"
"2494660","2497460"," know what you need to know for what you do right."
"2497460","2502700"," And you speak to an ER doctor and they know what they need to do it to be an ER"
"2502700","2503140"," doctor. "
"2503580","2509220"," And then if you were to speak to a researcher they're going to know a different level that's not"
"2509220","2515240"," applicable to what an RN does but has a different explanation for something scientific."
"2516640","2517440"," Does that make sense?"
"2523840","2526980"," You know the creator of CHATGP has said that it interviews that it's biased."
"2526980","2528180"," It should be. "
"2530710","2531850"," It should be biased."
"2532670","2538470"," And then and then you're and then you as the consumer of it what the information that you're"
"2538470","2544790"," looking at from it or from it to give to you is probably roughly based on your own intelligence."
"2545750","2546710"," Does that make sense?"
"2547990","2554690"," You're going to be fed information that you can understand because you're not asking questions from"
"2554690","2557810"," a level of education or even intelligence. "
"2558650","2560990"," To know how to ask for those answers."
"2564160","2565260"," So does it make you smarter?"
"2565740","2566100"," I don't know."
"2566260","2567100"," I mean some and some things. "
"2567340","2570560"," Yeah, it should like can you teach me French is a great example."
"2578260","2580500"," Yeah, could you imagine if it answered questions?"
"2580760","2581360"," Well, that's when it come."
"2581740","2583240"," That's the other question too, right?"
"2583420","2586800"," Could you imagine if it answered questions about what we should do about the Colorado River. "
"2589060","2593880"," It opens the door to what a lot of a lot of people are fearful about AI, right?"
"2593880","2597960"," When it begins to make its own decisions or you allow it out of the box to make its own"
"2597960","2598300"," decisions."
"2620400","2625300"," Yeah, the argument though that it's like it's like Anna spaghetti saying something on YouTube said"
"2625300","2626680"," it's not a replacement for intelligence."
"2626760","2628240"," It's an aid like any device. "
"2630200","2635340"," It's being used and it'll be accepted though at some point, right as intelligence or you at the"
"2635340","2637520"," moment you can't understand if it's intelligent or not."
"2639680","2640900"," Here's a here's a fair point."
"2642240","2649360"," If I can get it to write a song that sounds like a Drake song, does that make me intelligent?"
"2650520","2654520"," Is the question right or do I sound intelligent if I made that song probably?"
"2658220","2660340"," Is it good enough to sell probably?"
"2661520","2663060"," Good enough to record probably. "
"2668840","2671660"," Yeah, Google is not a good a good answer."
"2672280","2673820"," Google is very topical."
"2674640","2682400"," The amount of information on Google the amount of information truly on Google is like 1% of the"
"2682400","2683380"," information in the world. "
"2685600","2686960"," It's very small minute."
"2688740","2691460"," Google is a fascinating thing to even bring up."
"2693520","2699680"," The world of knowledge the world of knowledge and Google goes like one scraping the surface. "
"2700340","2706800"," Matter of fact, the entire content of Google is about 1% of knowledge in the world."
"2707280","2707880"," It's very small."
"2708200","2714380"," It's why it's being released right now because these creators of AI know they have to get more"
"2714380","2717740"," experience and more knowledge that is not on Google. "
"2723000","2724420"," What is it Sam Altman?"
