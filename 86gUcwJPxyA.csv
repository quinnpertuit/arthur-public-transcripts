"86gUcwJPxyA","282560","284020"," I"
"86gUcwJPxyA","284020","286880"," Don't know where futures are opening today"

"86gUcwJPxyA","295360","296840"," How about I just wait on that stuff"
"86gUcwJPxyA","296840","302480"," You know, you guys want to know how we open up futures if I had to guess if it was a normal month and a normal year"
"86gUcwJPxyA","302480","309920"," I would say that we open up green and I'll get into that later. I think we might even be green this week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","311080","314640"," Shockingly and we'll look at the chart and talk about it a little bit"
"86gUcwJPxyA","314640","319920"," I think we're green and it was funny because you know futures have been open and everyone's saying and it's gonna"
"86gUcwJPxyA","319920","326200"," Be red and it was it turned green right eventually overnight futures went green. I think we're green this week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","326520","330480"," It it was odd because I wasn't scaling out on my charts"
"86gUcwJPxyA","331040","335080"," Last Friday until the end of the day and when I looked at the charts again"
"86gUcwJPxyA","335920","343480"," There's you know, it looked like any month any year you would be buying a you would have been buying that bottom and mass and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","344200","348240"," There would have been many market participants. We didn't have as many market participants on Friday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","348680","351920"," We'll go through some of the technicals and that stuff as we move forward"
"86gUcwJPxyA","351920","357080"," There is going to be volatility and well, at least that's what people think that there will be some volatility this week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","357520","360800"," But I first wanted to start with this article here in the Wall Street Journal"
"86gUcwJPxyA","360800","364280"," They seem to put these articles out every three months six months or a year"
"86gUcwJPxyA","364400","369840"," But if you guys haven't had a chance to read it yet, it's worth the few key points and nuggets that are in here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","370240","376080"," and basically what they're saying is that hedge funds are following day traders across social media and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","376920","382760"," I noticed it in my feed on Twitter. I ended up making the captains at captain's alpha feed and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","383520","385520"," even in that feed I found"
"86gUcwJPxyA","386560","389720"," There are some hedge fund guys in there. I know that there are people that listen to this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","390360","393340"," broadcast or at least follow the ad captain's alpha and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","394240","395840"," scrape"
"86gUcwJPxyA","395840","401600"," Where we're trading and it made me like think all weekend long because all I kept thinking about was men"
"86gUcwJPxyA","401600","404720"," you know, all these guys gonna do is hear us on a live stream or"
"86gUcwJPxyA","405680","413200"," See where the flow is being directed. They're probably tracking all the flow software out there and it peaked this article specifically peaked my interest because"
"86gUcwJPxyA","414560","423240"," This past week I took a look back into all the new flow that came in and there were it seemed like the hedging that was made was"
"86gUcwJPxyA","424280","427840"," Some of it slipped through so you could get a look in glass view into"
"86gUcwJPxyA","428320","431200"," the hedging that's taking place in parts of the market and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","432160","436080"," We looked at tickers that had hedging that slipped through right we had xlk"
"86gUcwJPxyA","437520","441320"," And we had kr or xrt and kr specifically"
"86gUcwJPxyA","442280","445400"," Kroger and consumer cyclicals ETF"
"86gUcwJPxyA","446160","452720"," Had large block trades slipped through what really peaked my interest was it seemed like some tickers last week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","453000","459680"," Had hedging put on but that funds were trying to mask or hide that hedging and if you read this article"
"86gUcwJPxyA","459680","461680"," That's what it talks about in here talks about"
"86gUcwJPxyA","462560","468560"," Banks and hedge funds trying to get a leg up on traders or not short traders"
"86gUcwJPxyA","468560","473720"," I don't believe that part, but they are trying to infiltrate and trade like retail traders"
"86gUcwJPxyA","473760","475760"," So if you get a chance look at this, okay?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","476640","480120"," We're gonna go to the next point and let's take a look here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","481360","483360"," So these are the early release"
"86gUcwJPxyA","484000","489660"," Numbers for tomorrow from spot gamma now these don't match up to my levels that I have right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","489680","493180"," Now to some of my levels. I want you guys to realize out there that I give you guys"
"86gUcwJPxyA","493640","499200"," Support resistance levels with pivot points most days of the week. Those do not match"
"86gUcwJPxyA","499200","504640"," Those are traditional support resistance numbers. I blend those with these numbers here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","505040","510320"," So if you haven't seen this information, you can always come back at the end pause the video and take a look"
"86gUcwJPxyA","512120","516720"," Another thing that I did this weekend was I started to look at some finviz screeners, okay?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","517560","525720"," And I was looking through my finviz screeners this weekend for this is an oversold chart. This is a bounce. This is considered a bounce screener"
"86gUcwJPxyA","526880","527720"," and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","527720","531720"," One of the interesting parts of this bounce screener was I started to look at it from"
"86gUcwJPxyA","532960","534960"," charting perspective"
"86gUcwJPxyA","534960","535920"," and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","535920","540040"," The scary thing that I noticed was that a lot of these charts have not"
"86gUcwJPxyA","540520","543640"," This is typically a typical year a typical month"
"86gUcwJPxyA","543640","551160"," I can use this screener to find where a bounce would be and I'm a little shocked at the failures that I've seen in this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","551600","552720"," bounce screener"
"86gUcwJPxyA","552720","555720"," I'm not seeing like where I can buy a bounce here, but I'm seeing"
"86gUcwJPxyA","556400","561000"," actual failures within this screener, which is not"
"86gUcwJPxyA","561800","564560"," Not good right on the or at least on the surface"
"86gUcwJPxyA","565240","567880"," When I see these stocks like Meg here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","569000","571280"," failing within these screeners"
"86gUcwJPxyA","572240","578600"," I'm trying to do research on to what to look for right which stocks I'm gonna be looking for from now into March"
"86gUcwJPxyA","578600","582400"," and I'm quite shocked as to some of the"
"86gUcwJPxyA","583400","589400"," failures that have taken place within traditional charting lines usually you can you can get a few"
"86gUcwJPxyA","590320","595800"," tickers to find in here further or there was a ton of tickers in here usually might have"
"86gUcwJPxyA","595800","600640"," 25 50 60 I have some others to show you here as well, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","600640","605480"," So this one right here. This is one of my favorites. This is a stocker screener that I use"
"86gUcwJPxyA","607000","613720"," That I'll use it I use four tickers that are being moved by banks currently so they're in an uptrend"
"86gUcwJPxyA","614480","617400"," They've got great sales growth quarter over quarter"
"86gUcwJPxyA","618000","624680"," They're beating everything right there. They're up that day. They're above their 50ms sma. They're above their 20 sma"
"86gUcwJPxyA","624680","629880"," It's typically like MP. I think right now shows a nice little chart. We can look at MP real quick"
"86gUcwJPxyA","631320","634680"," But usually I've got a nice beautiful channel coming up. There's a nice reversal"
"86gUcwJPxyA","636080","637080"," Something like this, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","637080","639520"," But normally I'm just catching the reversal"
"86gUcwJPxyA","639960","644000"," Normally, it's just starting to turn for me and instead of catching knives"
"86gUcwJPxyA","644000","650120"," I use this screener to look for stocks that are turned now in a regular week regular month"
"86gUcwJPxyA","650120","653880"," I can come I can pop this thing up once a week once every three days"
"86gUcwJPxyA","654680","659400"," and I'll get anywhere from five to ten tickers to trade and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","660320","666120"," It proves very fruitful. You know, I use these all last years. I post a bunch of tickers on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","666680","672280"," I post a bunch of tickers on Twitter and had no problems right now. I'm down to two tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","673160","677320"," So this whole weekend I'm doing all this research right. I'm just checking out stocks checking out stocks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","677640","682240"," I've got this one here. This is a this is my ugly. This is my my knife catcher, right and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","682240","686440"," And right now I've got 313 stocks on here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","686440","691920"," I should normally have no more than a hundred hundred and fifty at max. This is a very bare bones one, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","691920","693920"," And this next one over here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","694560","701400"," This is as bare bones as it gets the scary part about this is this is as basic as it gets price below 200 ma"
"86gUcwJPxyA","701800","704680"," SMA 4,230 stocks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","704680","709840"," I never see that never never never so the point that I'm trying to make too is that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","710800","716520"," many stocks out there right now are in that stealth correction that we have and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","717760","723320"," In that stealth correction that we have going on right now. There is a thought from people that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","724400","728240"," You know where we are in the stock where they s&p 500 is right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","728920","734920"," That it's do or die right that if any of these stocks go any lower than where they are right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","734920","737640"," So a lot of these stocks are actually at there"
"86gUcwJPxyA","740120","742120"," starting point at this point"
"86gUcwJPxyA","742480","744480"," from March of 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","745360","747360"," I want to show you one briefly"
"86gUcwJPxyA","747800","750600"," This is an interesting one. I'm gonna leave yes real quick"
"86gUcwJPxyA","754720","757440"," And I got a wayfare real quick just want to show you a wayfare"
"86gUcwJPxyA","760000","765000"," And what I'm talking about here now not all stocks are here. We know that like squares not quite there yet"
"86gUcwJPxyA","765640","768200"," Let's just let's take a look at like wayfare. Okay"
"86gUcwJPxyA","769200","770840"," And"
"86gUcwJPxyA","770840","775400"," You know it wayfare started to craft blood or dump back here in April of 2019"
"86gUcwJPxyA","776440","783440"," And this is March 2020 and it's just above where it should kind of be going back to March 2020 and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","784080","788040"," What's interesting about this ticker specifically is what we're gonna talk about tonight"
"86gUcwJPxyA","788040","792520"," and that's a report that spot gamma has been harping on for the past week or so and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","792520","798600"," And now they released some information over the weekend about what to expect and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","799600","803480"," Surprisingly wayfare is one of the tickers is one of these tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","804000","807720"," Zillow is one of these tickers as well. I want to show you Zillow as well"
"86gUcwJPxyA","808240","810400"," and there's a reason for this and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","811760","813760"," Zillow is a prime example"
"86gUcwJPxyA","813880","819480"," so Zillow back here this was this was Zillow back in February of 2020 and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","819480","825920"," Zillow climbed right like crazy now we can use all the news in the world the good the bad news about Zillow or whatever"
"86gUcwJPxyA","827200","831760"," Now we're gonna talk about here is spot gamma was saying along the lines of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","832480","836200"," this expect volatility this week into February 1st and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","837400","844040"," When you're looking at tickers that have large large option volume falling off of them"
"86gUcwJPxyA","844600","846600"," they didn't want to put a finger on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","847440","855440"," On which tickers had call volume which tickers had call volume that was just a long call over over a long period of time to buy stock"
"86gUcwJPxyA","856760","864080"," What what parts of the this call volume was actually shorting stocks and one of these tickets the camp was was was Zillow"
"86gUcwJPxyA","865360","870440"," And what's interesting about Zillow is the options that are falling off are"
"86gUcwJPxyA","871840","873840"," reminiscent to an extent of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","874840","876840"," GME back in"
"86gUcwJPxyA","877840","881360"," December, excuse me January and February of 2020 and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","882680","888320"," When you we're gonna go through this discussion that spot cam has because spot camera brings up the big tech companies and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","889240","893880"," That you've got someone like Nancy Pelosi that might have calls in a company like let's say Microsoft"
"86gUcwJPxyA","894280","900080"," That she takes over three or six months and she she catches them in for stocks. Let's say right or"
"86gUcwJPxyA","900080","906480"," Or are they just long calls that they're not going to execute take profit on and rug pull this week?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","907120","910560"," But then there are other tickers that are similar to GME"
"86gUcwJPxyA","911000","916200"," Zillow is one of them and we're gonna go through some of these tickers later on so you can have a look at them"
"86gUcwJPxyA","916240","921200"," But I think the implication is that some of the high flyers have been high flying to this point"
"86gUcwJPxyA","921840","923840"," might have a chance to"
"86gUcwJPxyA","924440","926440"," start to trade down and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","927000","928600"," tickers that are"
"86gUcwJPxyA","928600","937080"," So or have been shorted since this one's been shorted since February of 2021 might have some capitulation moments, but actually might"
"86gUcwJPxyA","938440","940200"," Squeeze as well"
"86gUcwJPxyA","940200","945920"," There may be a squeeze opportunity in here heading into the first of the year and so we're gonna go through this right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","945920","947520"," We're gonna look at"
"86gUcwJPxyA","947520","952080"," Well, we'll first look at you know the fact all of all these my fingers scanners are saying"
"86gUcwJPxyA","952240","956160"," You know that there's the stealth correction in this market right here, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","956440","959160"," You've got bears saying well the market's gonna crash"
"86gUcwJPxyA","959800","965760"," Right, which I don't like to believe because it's it's kind of like you're being forewarned by everybody and their sister"
"86gUcwJPxyA","965760","970920"," Everybody out there knows that we're gonna crash and you have some of this stuff. That's already taking place"
"86gUcwJPxyA","971920","973920"," so maybe the indexes are weak and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","974240","980080"," What's interesting is in January of 2020 in January of 2021 the indexes were weak"
"86gUcwJPxyA","980520","983840"," Yet a whole ton of stocks that were beaten down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","984240","988880"," Just fired off during this time period and crazy crazy all-time highs"
"86gUcwJPxyA","989120","994520"," And I wound up I traded GME in this time period and this looks like a GME to me one of the tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","994520","996800"," That looks like a GME to me in that time frame"
"86gUcwJPxyA","996960","1001080"," So we're gonna go through right now and just look cuz I know everybody's been talking about this. I think on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1001520","1003520"," on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1005080","1009160"," Social media and you know Spock Emma did put out a video today. I think in the afternoon"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1009880","1015400"," Addressing this not in as much detail and they were very wishy washy in trying to say this will work"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1015400","1018960"," This will not work if they have to write they can't say this is what's going to happen"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1019960","1025520"," But the event is that this Friday and the 21st are deep in the money calls worth billions of dollars a set to expire, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1027080","1031240"," Their value is being essentially equivalent to shares of stock referred to as Delta 1 position"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1031800","1038880"," Most of these calls are purchased in 2021. I've participated in a massive stock rally over the last year. Okay, so"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1039240","1044120"," I wanted a key in on this which stocks have participated in a massive stock rally"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1044200","1049120"," We know that Tesla did at one point, right? We know that Apple did we know that Microsoft did"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1050120","1057160"," The participants he talks about is people like Nancy Pelosi very wealthy people big investors big banks and"

"86gUcwJPxyA","1060720","1065600"," But the potential impact is that regardless of these investors individuals straight trading strategies"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1066360","1072840"," That SG's models indicate that the net options Delta set to expire in the 21st is over 125 billion dollars"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1073040","1077280"," Their base cases at this expiration of these deep in the money calls are a catalyst for volatility"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1077520","1082320"," It was expanded stock price movement higher or lower notice that they're not giving a"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1083440","1086260"," definition as to what's moving higher what's moving lower"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1086880","1093080"," The ability to assign a direction to this volatility is dependent upon how one assumes these investors are positioned"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1093120","1102520"," That's a key point right there, right? How are these investors positioned? Are these investors going to execute their their positions and now own stock?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1102920","1108520"," Are these investors going to cash in their call they're deep in the money call?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1109240","1110520"," options and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1110520","1113480"," Just take the money and run right because we know that that will"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1114600","1121120"," Be get will reduce the call the call hedging that needs to take place right on that individual ticker that ticker can drop"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1121440","1122880"," right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1122880","1128480"," And if they're scared, let's say these guys are scared right and they're thinking the same thing that all of the media is talking about"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1128600","1131520"," They're you know got everybody out there saying we're gonna crash when a crash when a crash when a crash"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1131800","1134360"," So why would you be executing your calls for?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1135120","1139880"," Stock unless you know what's going to happen in the stock market and we don't know is retail traders, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1140800","1146800"," So there's a couple things you're looking for you're looking for when these if these calls are executed"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1147400","1153440"," For for stock for physical stock and they're not sold that would be a tip of the cards that the market is not going anywhere"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1153440","1159200"," That maybe Nancy Pelosi knows more than us and that she knows that apples can continue to go up or Roblox going to continue"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1159200","1161200"," But whatever the fuck she's in right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1161200","1163200"," Now if they are not executing"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1164000","1169280"," These call options. They're just taking the money and run you're gonna see the stock market start to trade down at some point"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1170040","1173760"," Now if the boat then this would lead into the first of February"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1173760","1178680"," We're gonna go into this. I'm gonna show you some examples of this happening in the past at the bulk of these options"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1179160","1186480"," Could vary which could vary by ticker when a ticker by ticker basis are held like my investors and our assumptions that there are options"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1186480","1190160"," dealer or short these calls and turn the deals likely hedges these short calls positions"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1190720","1192720"," through owning shares of the underlying stock and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1194720","1197200"," Offsetting long-call options that K long dull the positions"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1197520","1203320"," Conversely if these investors are net short calls and dealers would own long calls and may in turn short the underlying shares of the hedge"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1203760","1208880"," But as impossible to know the long-shore position equivocally are our belief that the buggles calls are long"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1209360","1215240"," That dealers are interned long shares of stock as a hedge. Therefore when these call positions are closed or expire"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1216000","1218800"," Dealers will need to sell their long stock hedges, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1218800","1221720"," So dealers will start selling these positions"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1222120","1228560"," Further is true that deals could have a position of these delta hedges cover to these copies causes exercise in which case short shares"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1228720","1232000"," Will be delivered to offset long hedge positions, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1232160","1237760"," So some of the names of the other in player Apple misfit Amazon Tesla Facebook and Google"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1238600","1241880"," And then they're going to say consider the ramifications of ETFs like arc"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1242120","1247440"," This well-known fun holds many of the stocks just had to have large compositions expiring, right? Basically they're saying"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1249840","1252680"," Expiration link hedging flows could worsen the ETF's performance"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1253280","1260280"," Now we have previous similar instances comparatively at this chain where I will pexas us is a similar size to January 2021"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1260360","1262360"," We're going to look at this here in a minute, okay?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1262360","1264360"," We see the size of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1264440","1271320"," Genera expirations as a function of strong stock performance and the growth of options trading however while 22 and 21 hold one"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1271480","1273480"," greater than 100 billion"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1273680","1280160"," There are major outliers for previous years for instance in January of 20 of 2020 there was 1 billion in delta expo"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1280160","1285760"," or less than 1 billion in delta expiring now if you look back on 2020 of January of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1286680","1288120"," 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1288120","1290120"," Even though it was less than 1 billion"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1290600","1296080"," The effect in the in the S&P 500 was the same. It was just smaller"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1296640","1301400"," the the the volatility was smaller, but even the pattern was the same as"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1302360","1304360"," in January of 2021"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1304680","1306680"," very similar, okay and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1306680","1310360"," That this is regardless of the fall that we had in March 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1310520","1315440"," Just the whole move was the same looking back at the performance of toward January 2021"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1315680","1319120"," The SMB closed flat from January opex to February 1st"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1319360","1327480"," But had a large trading range of nearly 4% the days after expiration led to the infamous a period of peak GME media Armenia"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1327480","1333880"," We're gonna we're gonna look at January in the S&P 500. We're gonna look at GME at the same time period"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1334440","1337760"," and it brought margin calls to Melbourne capital, right and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1338720","1340720"," capital calls to Robinhood"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1340960","1346800"," Shit it all right was involved in all this it is therefore very tough to isolate any option specific impact"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1346840","1353640"," But it's certainly possible the large expiration added to the volatility now. They don't really leave us"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1354080","1361040"," Spock Everly doesn't leave you with any other information. They're very vague to me at least in how do I interpret this?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1362120","1367320"," Now I did post on Twitter a list of all these stocks that have huge"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1367720","1373280"," Options expiration this month on the 21st leading in the 20th the first thing we're to look at is we are going to look at"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1374240","1376240"," the ES back in"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1377800","1382520"," January of 2020 we can look at 2022 and we'll look at a"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1384440","1389500"," I'll show you 2020 now. I don't want you to be getting all weirded out by let me see here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1389960","1391960"," I think it's a three-month chart"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1392960","1397160"," I don't want to get all weirded out by what took place in March of 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1397680","1400880"," Thereafter and say well, that's gonna happen this year either"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1401760","1404780"," Because it's not we we don't have COVID this year"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1405280","1408480"," And it's COVID didn't just begin this year, but we're gonna look back on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1408920","1415080"," Both of these dates and I want you to just see the similarities even though we had"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1416200","1418040"," notionally less"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1418040","1420040"," explorations but very similar still"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1421040","1424160"," So we're gonna look at January real quick of 2020 I"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1425320","1427920"," just wanted to back test it more than one year and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1429800","1433960"," It was very similar. Okay, so we ended up from January 20th"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1434440","1438880"," See if I can bring this one up. This was the Monday of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1439800","1441560"," Martin Luther King January 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1441560","1444440"," I ended up trading upright and then at the end of the week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1444440","1448520"," We end up trading down into the first of the year into the second of the year right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1448520","1454800"," So we trade it up slightly and then down let's say Thursday Friday into the last week of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1456560","1458000"," February and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1458000","1460960"," It wasn't as pronounced as it was in 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1461520","1467160"," But we do have something similar and you can see here. This is the this is the Martin Luther King week of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1468080","1473040"," 2020 we actually traded up. Okay, and this leads up into this leads up into"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1473840","1478640"," From Monday. This would be Monday trading up into Friday. I believe the 20"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1479120","1481120"," this is the 21st, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1481720","1484680"," And we're at the 17th today. Let's go look"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1486160","1492200"," And yeah, 21st ends up being or the 20th 21st right here ends up being that Thursday Friday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1492200","1500000"," So we kind of look we kind of peaked out on that Thursday and a day traded down into Friday and then with sideways into"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1500560","1506960"," Next week and then we we crash down. Okay, and we did the same thing in 2020 into the into the February 1st"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1508240","1514120"," Very similar action and if you look back on January 1st in 2020"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1515160","1517160"," We had lots of volatility, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1518120","1521560"," Lots of price movement in the S&P 500"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1522280","1525120"," Now all this on its own really doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1525920","1532080"," But I remember this time period and what I what what fascinated me about this time period was that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1535040","1541120"," Every I remember at this time period that Twitter specifically was all about the S&P 500 and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1541840","1544840"," all about the doom and gloom all over the market and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1546520","1553160"," In reality what ended up taking place was GME was going on and there was just a very small number of people"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1553640","1558880"," Wrapped up in GME and it became a little ridiculous, right? What took place with GME now?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1558880","1561280"," We're gonna look real quick at Tesla last year"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1561760","1566040"," And we can we can look on your own and why you look up Tesla when you look up Apple"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1566840","1570080"," Microsoft all these companies that that spot gamma mentioned and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1570840","1572840"," Let's look back in January"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1573760","1575440"," this time period"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1575440","1577440"," right of opex and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1577680","1582120"," If you look at this time period of opex last year, this is of 2021 right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1583160","1585160"," and we traded up on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1586320","1592520"," Tesla and then we immediately sold off and you can see we sold down into the 29th and we continue to sell down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1593480","1597600"," Into February right right right into March. Okay, and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1598280","1601680"," Then I want you to look at what what actually happened in GME now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1601680","1606080"," I'm not saying or implying at all that we should be trading GME into this week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1606240","1610760"," But there are a lot of stocks this year that are looking a hell of a lot like GME"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1610760","1612760"," and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1612800","1614800"," Remind me a lot of GME"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1615280","1619360"," That are on that list and here is January 19th of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1620760","1622760"," 2021 and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1623240","1625240"," It was it was wild"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1625480","1633080"," It was wild and it kept going up and up and up into the 28th of January. So we're on the only 17th right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1633640","1638480"," So you're talking about stocks that have been we can go look further back, right? If you look further back on GME"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1639120","1640480"," it actually"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1640480","1643480"," Follows somewhat of the playbook of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1644280","1646280"," stocks that were"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1646840","1651560"," This is the playbook for GME and it started back here in January of 2019"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1651760","1657600"," It was shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted and shorted"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1657600","1660120"," and I remember the moment when I was down like three bucks and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1661040","1663040"," it was just shorted into the ground and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1663040","1669520"," And part of the whole conversation back then was look when in a short something not to forget the synthetic shares"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1669520","1675640"," And look bullshit that all the eight nation and all those people talk about but it just gets so ridiculous at some point"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1676240","1683240"," That's and they're at their their their options are expiring in this January opex, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1683960","1685960"," That there's this brief moment"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1685960","1692840"," Where these stocks could move higher or move lower and you saw in January 21 in January of 21 on major tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1693320","1698280"," That's big players had had had pushed up all year long"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1699080","1702480"," And then you say saw all these tickers that have been beaten down for a year or two"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1702920","1706520"," Start to pop up and if you remember in 2021"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1707200","1711000"," The GMGE squeeze ended up squeezing a bunch of other stocks around the market"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1711000","1714280"," It started to happen across the market and other tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1714280","1718520"," And so I think this is some part of the implication that they're talking about now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1718520","1719840"," This might not happen, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1719920","1725920"," We know this might not happen, but this to me is part of what's going on in the background of this conversation is"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1727400","1731000"," Do you end up seeing maybe S&P go up this next week?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1731480","1734840"," And then it starts to sell down and off into the end of the month and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1735880","1740760"," Meanwhile, we're not paying attention to tickers like Zillow, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1743440","1749680"," So let's look at let's look briefly before we get to the S&P 500 we're gonna we're gonna end up looking at"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1749840","1753200"," And let me let's get it. Let's go to yes for back to yes real quick"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1753200","1758760"," And so what their point is that they're trying to say is this I don't know if this is spot gammas point"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1758760","1761320"," But this is the point that I'm inferencing is that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1764480","1767200"," You know you might see some kind of a swoop up here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1769160","1774440"," Wouldn't it wouldn't shock me to see you know some kind of some kind of a swoop up here, right and"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1775600","1778320"," Then we trade sideways and we start trading down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1779280","1781440"," So we see here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1783920","1785920"," We move this over here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1787680","1789680"," Let me delete this here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1789680","1794880"," You guys wanted a better time frame. It wouldn't shock me not knowing not nothing about these people these banks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1795360","1799160"," Shocks me so I guess the point would be you would start trading up, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1799520","1801040"," You get to a certain point here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1801040","1805240"," Maybe you don't break it all time new high and you start trading sideways into the end of the month, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","1805520","1807920"," Then you start trading down here, right?"

"86gUcwJPxyA","1934120","1938400"," And I'm questioning myself. Why is someone bought buying relentless calls on uber?"

"86gUcwJPxyA","2061680","2070320"," But there are specific ones that have absurd amounts of volume coming off of of Delta coming off of them"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2071440","2075040"," And that that's my point is it's not every one of the growth sucks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2075680","2077680"," You like z is unusual"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2079440","2085200"," Jamaya you've got 185 percent rolling off exp 180 percent"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2085920","2092400"," S. R. N. E. I mean crone right 168. I would never play crone five. I would play five"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2097120","2102480"," You're a crop too tight to read the left side of the screen. Oh, I see where they're saying hold out a second"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2102960","2104960"," Is that better"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2107680","2113120"," Sorry about that. I have to try to keep my I have to try to keep my credentials hidden on the screen sometimes"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2122880","2125680"," So I'm saying that growth will rally or bounce if spy"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2126160","2132560"," Okay, so yeah, so what I'm saying is that you might see a lot of these"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2136480","2143760"," Yeah, there is no takeaway. Okay, so what I am taking away from this mass Tesla's going to have massive earnings"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2146160","2148240"," Yeah, it's not so much the tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2148800","2154640"," It's not so much all the tickers that are beaten up. It's that specific ones have a bunch"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2155440","2159520"," Of options delta coming off them in this following week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2166880","2168880"," Is that better for you where we roam"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2173440","2178240"," Yeah, there's no takeaway from the report cap they pretty much saying some stocks could go up and some stocks could go down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2178880","2182960"," Yeah, I thought the same thing until I saw the flow coming in on uber on friday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2184960","2187680"," So it looks like they're targeting some stocks to go up"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2191520","2196400"," Or do you guys think that we're just gonna boom into burning season"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2203120","2209120"," So that's what we're gonna do. So what I'm gonna do is this okay is I'm gonna I'm gonna chart out some of these tickers with you real quick"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2209120","2215360"," Tesla's gonna go down and got it. Yeah, I don't think Tesla's going down. I think Tesla's going up"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2215920","2218800"," I think that most of the S&P is gonna be going up this week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2222000","2226720"," I think that's uh, I think though that once these options"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2228560","2230560"," Are executed or expire"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2232400","2238880"," Try agree trying this report the flows makes sense. Yeah, so we're gonna chart some of these out right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2239680","2241680"," We"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2241680","2247200"," We're gonna we're gonna chart some of these out if you want to and what I'll do is I'll set alerts on these tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2247920","2254400"," This week and what we'll do is we'll pay attention to them as the week unfolds now. I'm gonna trade the s&p 500"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2255920","2259040"," Yeah, last year's Tesla did have solid earnings and it did sell off"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2263360","2265360"," Yeah, so"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2265760","2270080"," So my my thought to you is this more my my my my positive is this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2271680","2278320"," My point is that I think that the market does go up this week into thursday friday. I would"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2287440","2290880"," My thought would be that we trade up into this week into into into thursday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2290960","2298640"," And then we trade sideways and start to roll over as the earnings season kicks off in the large earnings dates pass us"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2300240","2302960"," Well also in deposit that as the market begins to roll over"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2303600","2305600"," You guys should have some of these tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2306160","2310400"," On alert on your trading software. You guys need to get yourself if you don't already have"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2311040","2316080"," Legitimate brokerage out there. I don't care if you use like think or swim or I don't know weeble"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2316160","2322080"," Is like as basic as it comes right trading view anything like that. You can set alerts"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2322800","2327840"," On these tickers to see if they're going to my assumption would be that some of them are going to trade down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2328320","2330320"," heavily into opex"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2330560","2335280"," Maybe that capitulation movie you're looking for like a zillow and then you'll see"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2335920","2338240"," Uh an absurd rip on these tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2339040","2341760"," So you can set an alert down. Let's say on zillow"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2342480","2344640"," uh below and above to break"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2345200","2347120"," Uh the resistance channel, right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2347840","2355920"," And they might be some lucrative plays when I wound up playing gme last year. I made I was buying options for"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2357360","2358240"," Oh"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2358240","2360240"," $2.00 $3.50"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2361440","2364000"," And then I was cashing them out for 5060 bucks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2364880","2366880"," It was absolutely wild"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2368640","2370640"," Max pain is down at 810 thoughts"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2371600","2376960"," I think some some may rip and some may dump big rip snow. Maybe kept them watching the apple comparison"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2379360","2382720"," Gonna buy my puts back think or swim is good can set alert and press"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2382800","2385440"," Yeah, if you're if you've shorted at any of these companies"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2386000","2389840"," You might have a like a great opportune moment for the next week or two"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2390320","2395120"," Or excuse me, maybe let's call it into thursday. You might have great opportunity and some of these stocks have been beaten down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2396000","2398560"," But I would be scared after thursday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2400640","2402640"," You"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2404000","2407760"," Well, the reason why I think these stocks are going to rip is because"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2408640","2412800"," When you look at a stock like z versus a tesla"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2413520","2418720"," You can see that tesla and the question is the hedging that took place in the background"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2419760","2421680"," which stock had"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2421680","2424400"," Hedging that drove it into the ground and which stock had hedging"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2425120","2430560"," Where they were buying the buying the actually the actual underlying so you can see that tesla"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2431040","2433520"," The the hedging was done by buying the underlying"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2433920","2436800"," So once there's no more hedging required"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2437440","2441360"," And if the long calls are deep in the money the year long calls"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2442000","2444480"," If those are not executed for stock, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2445040","2448400"," You're going to get double selling on a tesla whereas"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2449120","2452320"," on a ticker like let's say zillow"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2452960","2457920"," The shorting of that stock will end even if it's for a brief moment"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2462960","2467680"," Yeah, I think that they have a high chance of ripping I think that I think that anything high on this list"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2468400","2470400"," Has a high chance of selling off"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2471280","2474400"," And I think unless I guess your positive would need to be"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2475360","2480080"," Is a is a Nancy Pelosi going to let's say let's say Nancy Pelosi had year long"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2480960","2483360"," Stock options in tesla and they're deep in the money"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2484240","2486400"," do you think that a cathie would or a"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2487520","2489520"," or a nancy Pelosi is going to"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2490640","2496160"," Uh, turn the convert those into those options and to start act physical shares of the company"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2496640","2498640"," Or they're going to take their money and run"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2499200","2501360"," Uh because of seasonal weakness in springtime"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2502240","2504240"," That would be the question"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2504240","2511520"," Yeah, we we have a prime example. I mentioned before"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2513520","2519360"," I mentioned before that you noticed it happened in city group on thursday. I think on wednesday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2520080","2523680"," I told you guys I said look they've been pumping up city group for this long period of time"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2524480","2526640"," You more than likely see some weakness into the close"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2527360","2531520"," If you see great earnings, you'll see this the stock just ripped to new levels, right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2532320","2537040"," Uh, anyone that was long in this stock and shares took profit before the opening bell"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2537040","2539040"," It ended up selling down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2539040","2541760"," The the morning of earnings who went down to the depths of hell"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2542400","2547680"," So if you were a day trader, you kind of got uh, you got your pants pulled down, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2548560","2552160"," You kind of got screwed in that whole entire play. You could really only be in"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2553040","2553760"," Uh"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2553760","2556720"," Some sort of put spread you couldn't be in just uh puts"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2557520","2559920"," Because of the interest going away from that stock as well"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2559920","2566640"," So then actually played out exactly how we thought it would and the city group would be a prime example of what to expect off of other stocks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2567280","2572720"," That have gone up all year long. Let's say an apple or a misfit even though misfits down right now like an apple or a misfit"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2573120","2575120"," Uh or a tesla"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2576800","2581040"," They can roll up to the they can roll to a future date, but there is a brief moments where"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2581760","2583920"," You know, this is what happened with gme, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2583920","2586800"," This is exactly what took place with gme and they can roll this out"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2587360","2594240"," Um, but some of these stickers they may not have rolled it out or there may be in renewed interests if there is a short covering"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2594800","2598560"," Uh in the stock. So let's say zillow has a short come from covering moment"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2598960","2605920"," The stock starts to jump up and retail jumps on that ticker. It's it's the same thing that um, whatever his face from"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2607360","2609440"," Uh, whatever that banker's name was talked about"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2610000","2611840"," Uh, what happened to him, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2611840","2616240"," That short squeeze that short covering squeeze ends up turning into a retail squeeze"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2616960","2620000"," And the stock just rips higher and higher and higher and higher"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2620160","2622400"," Another one of these two to look out would be viacom"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2622960","2627760"," We talked about viacom back in december and that's exactly what's taking place in viacom"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2628160","2630000"," It just keeps ripping right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2630000","2633200"," So we'll look at a few of these and see what your thoughts are"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2633920","2639440"," I'm going to set some alerts here with you you guys can log off now if you want to what i'm going to do is i'm just going to"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2639840","2641840"," Uh chart some of these tickers out for you"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2642320","2644320"," I'm going to set some alerts on my end"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2644800","2647920"," So that while we're live streaming this week into next week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2648480","2651760"," If they start to trigger any of these alerts either on the downside"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2652240","2656400"," For capitulation or once they trigger if the time and date"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2656800","2658400"," Uh adds up correctly"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2658400","2664080"," We'll look for some sort of a short covering and we'll we'll set some more alerts for that to take place"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2664480","2665920"," So that we can shift"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2665920","2668720"," Let's say we start let's say we trade up for just a few days here into thursday"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2669200","2673200"," And we need something to trade into end of week or into next week"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2673760","2679120"," Uh, this might be a great lineup of stocks to be paying attention to and I don't think we're the only people"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2679520","2681280"," They're going to be paying attention to these stocks"

"86gUcwJPxyA","2797360","2799200"," The high volatility that's expected"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2799760","2804720"," And we start to bounce around down here or even in here if we can even get as deep in here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2804720","2810480"," I'm interested in seeing how deep this is one of the most shorted stocks in the market where you guys know wafer"

"86gUcwJPxyA","2863760","2865760"," Right here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2872800","2876960"," And this is something should have put this on w, but I didn't"

"86gUcwJPxyA","2888800","2890800"," Just rack some money"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2897760","2903040"," This is similar to how you would how you would chart all of these out if you chart all of these tickers similar to this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2903520","2905520"," the ones that have been beaten down specifically"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2906560","2910240"," You're gonna be waiting and watching to see if there's any sort of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2910240","2912240"," Of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2913120","2915120"," Response at these levels"

"86gUcwJPxyA","2931680","2933680"," Yeah, imagine buying wafer at 350"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2936240","2938240"," It's pretty wild right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2939120","2942880"," And wafer wafer i think has always been one of the most"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2947680","2949440"," Shorted stocks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2949440","2953760"," But it wouldn't shock me to see us trade down massive right to see a 50 point dump"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2954480","2957760"," Down here in wafer even a hundred point dump none of this would shock me down here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2958080","2960080"," And even if we don't hit this these numbers now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2960880","2962880"," Just having these available"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2963120","2965120"," gives you the opportunity to look for"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2966080","2970080"," When they tag you'll look for some sort of consolidation when you get an alert"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2970480","2972800"," You know look for some sort of a consolidation in here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2973600","2976960"," Right and you want to see this this sort of a thing happen"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2977600","2981440"," Trading up and you can start to take it long again. That doesn't mean that's going to happen with wafer"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2981600","2983440"," But if you do enough of these"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2983440","2987840"," Uh, you will find them tag or tag below eventually, right if you don't see"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2988480","2991360"," If you see like a wafer, let's say we let's say we tag down here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2991840","2993360"," So we keep going down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2993360","2998080"," You're going to get an alert here boom you get an alert and you're going to check wafer and see if it does this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","2999040","3002240"," Right and you're going to start to pay attention to it if it crashes down again"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3002880","3005040"," Starts doing this kind of a nonsense"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3005040","3009520"," Then it crashes down here and you start to see it go like this and you're like, oh, it looks like we've got"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3009920","3012080"," Uh, we finally got rid of some of these sellers, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3012720","3015840"," You'll see a trade above and as soon as it does something like this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3016320","3018560"," You would take this long right here. Does that make sense?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3018720","3020720"," This would look like a good long at this point"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3021200","3023200"," Starting to make that nice turn"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3023200","3025200"," You do enough of these tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3025200","3028000"," And uh, you'll feel catch one into this year"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3028560","3029840"," Now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3029840","3031920"," This is a long time frame, right? This is in the june"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3032720","3036400"," So i'm going to be paying more attention to say wafer"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3037040","3041680"," Now in case it was to come down in spike. Let's say it was to come down here and just go straight north"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3042400","3047040"," Be more interested in this move right here. I'm going to have to check to see if the volume increases"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3047600","3051680"," On this move, right? We started to see a big green bar big reversal of some kind"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3052320","3053680"," um"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3053680","3055680"," Okay, we'll do the next one"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3056400","3060160"," We think we did uh, I think we did z already, but we'll look at z"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3062720","3064720"," We already know about uber"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3066160","3072160"," I think did i already do z? Yes, he already did z it's a prime candidate to me. This is a fierce move down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3072720","3074480"," Over here if we were to see"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3074480","3076560"," See zillow come down into this"

"86gUcwJPxyA","3634480","3637040"," So if you can see a nice capitulation move on blink"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3640160","3642400"," See if we can look at this on a smaller time frame"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3642400","3644400"," So"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3650720","3655280"," It's almost looks like a you got one two three four"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3656240","3658240"," We traded slightly lower"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3659360","3662960"," People want to buy it down here at 13 bucks or so it's a good one"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3664480","3666480"," All right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3666800","3668800"," We got peton which I hate"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3669440","3671440"," I personally think peton's gonna be a"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3672400","3674400"," max a ten dollar stock"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3674800","3676560"," but"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3676560","3681840"," The number of calls coming out in it looks like it's more of a hedge fund play"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3684640","3687920"," It looks more like about money and not believing in your shitty tickers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3690320","3694240"," So we're gonna put blink here or whatever that blink we're gonna put"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3694240","3696240"," It"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3699680","3703600"," Let's just look back see where it started start back here at 32 bucks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3705680","3707680"," So it's tagging right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3707680","3711200"," I saw a lot of blink calls this week and i'm like why am I seeing blink calls?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3711200","3715040"," This is the reason why but I think blink trades down to like 10 bucks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3716000","3717680"," but"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3717680","3723440"," To not pay attention to peton not blink. I think peton trades down to 10 bucks or so"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3724240","3729120"," But to not pay attention to it down here in between 30 and 20. This is like hood, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3729680","3732160"," Well, it's not a hood in any way shape or form"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3732720","3737600"," But if it tags down here at 10 bucks or three bucks or two bucks, it's still worth paying attention to"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3738320","3740320"," as it trades down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3740560","3743920"," If there's a capitulation moment there might be a move a move higher"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3748400","3750400"," And I don't believe in peton at all so just"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3751280","3753520"," Take that with what it's worth"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3755360","3757360"," It's more of a squeeze play"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3760160","3762160"," Uso long versus peton short"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3764880","3766880"," Yes futures up and going right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3769600","3772640"," Do you look at futures? I haven't even looked"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3781360","3787920"," Futures even open yet but they're open till six or they open early because it's a day off"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3791760","3793760"," And only they're open yet maybe"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3795520","3797920"," Doesn't like they're open yet very flat"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3800560","3805360"," I can't see my clock here. All right, let's move on a few more"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3806640","3808640"," We're gonna look at space"

"86gUcwJPxyA","3814880","3817600"," Raging galactic the darling of the internet for a long time"

"86gUcwJPxyA","3823680","3825680"," This is one that I want to really pay attention to"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3828240","3830240"," It's gotten so beaten down"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3830880","3835040"," And then you've got you've got banks out there. You've got ray dahlio telling you"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3836000","3838000"," That this is doom and gloom, right"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3838000","3840640"," That it's never coming back ever again in the future"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3841520","3843520"," And you get space down here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3844320","3846320"," 10 bucks"

"86gUcwJPxyA","3865040","3866720"," That's what i'm looking for"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3866720","3872480"," All i'm gonna be looking for is so what i'll do is i'll check all these on their volume each day if they're up in the morning"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3873040","3877600"," I mean space went to 60 bucks now. I don't think this space has anything happening"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3878560","3883760"," To make them go to 60 bucks ever again, but I do think that at some point shorts are gonna cover in here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3885600","3887600"," I'm gonna look at five next"
"86gUcwJPxyA","3887600","3889600"," And"

"86gUcwJPxyA","4003520","4008000"," wore out the last sellers, but in my mind, I think we have one more capitulation move"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4008960","4011360"," Almost positive you have a more capitulation move here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4021280","4027120"," As someone asked what my dotted lines are this is where I think when you trade within a range"

"86gUcwJPxyA","4312480","4316640"," We can do or did I do uber? I don't know if I did uber so this week we had a bunch of calls coming in uber"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4320320","4324960"," Just kept coming in and uber kept selling off and selling off and selling off and selling off and selling off"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4325120","4327840"," I'm like, why is why are so many calls coming in on uber?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4328960","4332080"," Like what is happening here on uber we keep getting calls"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4332960","4336400"," So we traded up. Let's say this is baseline right get this in yellow back here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4337360","4341600"," All right, there's an outlier event got lots of consolidation here we trade up"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4342880","4345200"," Right and we we met with sellers"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4345840","4349120"," So we started to trade down and then we have bag holders here, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4350000","4353280"," Trade above you think it's gonna get above but no got more bag holders"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4353840","4356240"," Just selling it down found some support trade it up"

"86gUcwJPxyA","4361920","4363920"," finally broke through"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4364880","4368480"," Trading sideways here a little more consolidation need a little bit more oomph"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4369120","4372000"," Trade it up still didn't get and i've got people trying to get out here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4372320","4376800"," I'm going to assume this is more paranoia in the market market's going to sell off doom and gloom kind of shit"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4378320","4381120"," And so my my assumption went on friday is like man"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4381120","4384160"," We're going to keep selling down here until we find some support"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4384560","4388960"," So i'm still looking for even though there were calls but still looking for 38 bucks"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4389440","4393280"," 38 36 bucks and possibly even heading down to this 28"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4394160","4399040"," Now there might be one more line you could put in down here as an outlier event right here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4402160","4404160"," Wait a minute"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4405280","4407280"," That kneeled trash can"

"86gUcwJPxyA","4415120","4417520"," I do really like this you kind of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4418320","4423200"," So you've got sellers here, right? Let's see get all these all these bullshitters up here that are now trapped, right?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4424080","4426720"," And they're just hoping that you trade higher which happened here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4427520","4434160"," Happened here happened here. Yeah, i'm going to expect it to come down somewhere in this fair area here even though there was all that call buying"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4435360","4438400"," Expectation is that trade down here somewhere"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4441440","4443440"," You're going to see something like this"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4447120","4451200"," At least to hear i want this move right here if i can get it"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4451680","4454480"," I want that move right there. It's a 20% move"

"86gUcwJPxyA","4474320","4476320"," Look at look at pen"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4476560","4479920"," Supposedly one of them are going to go bankrupt and that's going to get shorted into the ground"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4480720","4482720"," That was the implication"
"86gUcwJPxyA","4483840","4485840"," Which one do you guys think it is?"

"86gUcwJPxyA","6396400","6397600"," I know that the"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6397600","6399360"," News says that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6399360","6402560"," Zoom will never make money people going back to work, but that's not the truth"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6403520","6405520"," So anywhere from 154"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6407280","6411120"," See 154 kind of like it right now too"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6423760","6425760"," You"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6436400","6438400"," A little bit closer"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6440800","6443280"," So it's at 159 or something right now"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6445520","6447520"," This is gonna be a good one to watch"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6448720","6450800"," I'm gonna do get rid of that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6453520","6455520"," Get rid of that"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6457280","6459280"," I'm gonna my alerts gonna be on this right here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6462160","6464160"," Wanna see zoom"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6475440","6477440"," Set the alert right here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6477840","6480400"," So I can catch an alert on this on this down channel"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6480880","6482880"," It breaks or touches it and breaks above"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6484080","6488880"," I'm game for this one if not my price target for zoom is one 10 96"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6490160","6492160"," It'd be slightly higher"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6494240","6496240"," Doesn't shock me"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6497120","6498480"," Maybe here"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6498480","6500480"," 133 it would be first stop"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6501120","6503120"," Second stop 110"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6503680","6510240"," But I'll set the alert because if it breaks above here and starts to turn at any point it's a great play to take take on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6510480","6512480"," Okay, that's what I've got for tonight"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6513120","6515120"," Zoomie hours on"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6515280","6517280"," something 28"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6518240","6520240"," 228 and 40 days"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6520320","6524560"," Yeah, I think I can trade down from here. Are we gonna easily get down 110 bucks?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6525360","6527360"," I don't I don't see why not"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6527680","6530800"," I don't think we get as deep as we did in 2019"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6531440","6535600"," I think this is the area for zoom to consolidate"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6536960","6538720"," And I like zoom to be honest with you"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6538800","6542080"," I know that google teams and is popular out there"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6542640","6544640"," You've got this whole like"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6544640","6548800"," People that aren't in teams that use zoom there's a whole bunch of people that don't use zoom or excuse me"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6549200","6551200"," Don't use google teams"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6551200","6554320"," And I think they have a niche. I don't think they're ever gonna be google teams"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6555280","6557280"," But there's a definite niche"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6557600","6560160"," I don't think that they go bankrupt their earnings are outstanding"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6561200","6563200"," I don't think that they're"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6563200","6565200"," I don't think they're quite like on the level of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6568720","6573280"," I don't want to compare them to another company. I like zoom. I don't like their valuation"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6574320","6576320"," You know up here at 500 bucks or whatever"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6577520","6579920"," But if you look pre-covid"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6581120","6585040"," You know they were this is pre-covid back here and they were valued in a hundred bucks then"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6586160","6588160"," uh for the future of"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6590000","6596240"," Working remote, right? I think back here if I remember there was some thought that they would they were competing with google"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6597200","6599680"," Uh with teams is that google is that microsoft?"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6599680","6601760"," I don't i might be saying google when it's microsoft"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6601760","6605920"," But it's microsoft teams and microsoft teams just kind of took over or whatever"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6606400","6610240"," My wife uses microsoft teams who are whatever the fuck companies is them"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6610720","6615360"," They have huge integration in companies and I think zoom's kind of drop the ball in that aspect"
"86gUcwJPxyA","6616000","6618000"," But they still have a place out there"
