"280","520"," All right."
"680","1620"," Let's see if this works now."
"5650","6130"," Okay. "
"23200","33100"," Just a second here, we'll get back to, uh, we'll start"
"33100","34960"," this over one more time here."
"59840","60940"," Let's make sure that I'm here."
"61260","62060"," Can you guys hear me?"
"62960","66980"," Yeah, you know, you see that Linus tech tip stuff yesterday too. "
"68720","70160"," And hang tight here."
"72000","74380"," Or did you see the Linus tech tip stuff yesterday?"
"75220","76960"," We're going to take this one and delete it."
"79140","81160"," Delete forever, yes sir. "
"82700","84740"," We're going to delete that forever."
"85120","88920"," We're going to make that enlisted maybe."
"90080","90500"," Public. "
"91280","92280"," I'm listed."
"92740","93260"," Save."
"95120","96480"," We're going to give you just a second area. "
"96640","97520"," A couple of things we've got to do."
"99500","100100"," Done."
"100700","100900"," Save. "
"104420","106480"," I just reset everything."
"110540","113630"," See here."
"114310","115890"," We will not be thwarted on a Friday. "
"115890","119350"," I apologize for that for the moment here."
"122110","123790"," It's, uh, sometimes."
"126930","131330"," Just save that in there. "
"131710","131850"," Edit."
"132090","133170"," Come on, baby, do it."
"133470","134290"," Give me a right back up there. "
"135450","136550"," Any duration."
"137290","139850"," This actually gives people time to get back in here again too."
"141670","143450"," Save and then, uh. "
"145490","146050"," Copy."
"153420","153980"," Tweet."
"155740","156620"," Send now. "
"157400","157960"," Okay."
"159180","160560"," Let's take our back on here again."
"161080","162960"," Back up and running and apologize for that. "
"165220","165880"," Hey, buddy."
"168940","169340"," Okay."
"169380","173760"," I'm going to delete this one right here. "
"175620","176020"," Delete."
"178460","180480"," Just make sure I get everything going here in the background."
"182340","183760"," We back on Twitch too. "
"184140","184760"," Yeah, good morning."
"184960","185320"," How are you doing?"
"185920","186900"," But had bangers."
"187140","194640"," What's going on, brother?"
"194640","195100"," Back on again. "
"195720","196340"," Nice."
"198520","199800"," All right."
"201400","202700"," Back on again. "
"203460","205820"," I kid you not."
"207420","209620"," Like the technical background stuff."
"209840","212080"," It's never ending. "
"213100","213780"," It literally is never."
"213940","216840"," The crazy part is, is that I opened up my task manager."
"217600","220740"," And I found like 18 instances of streamlabs running. "
"221080","224320"," I don't know if it was part of the processes when it got cut off or if it was."
"225880","227560"," Streamlabs is a disaster sometimes."
"228240","228860"," Uh, whatever. "
"229620","232420"," They reset my modem and my router at the same time, just in case."
"233200","236640"," Just try because I was downloading porn late night last night."
"237300","238740"," Uh, Hobbit porn. "
"239580","241980"," Hobbit, Hobbit, uh, ankle porn."
"242120","245060"," I have been expanding my, uh, expanding my, uh."
"249400","250420"," I don't know. "
"258680","259079"," Okay."
"259399","263460"," So, uh, a man of culture."
"266100","269360"," So I just get back over to this, uh, the spy chart real quick. "
"269500","270620"," We're going to show you a couple things here."
"277280","279380"," Uh, so just trend wise, right?"
"281240","282560"," Uh, just see if I can."
"284360","285200"," Hold on here, me. "
"297170","297910"," Okay, hold on."
"298030","298390"," This is going to help."
"302860","303620"," This is going to help. "
"305960","310720"," Actually, let me, uh, remove all the drawings here."
"312080","312400"," Okay."
"313980","316040"," Nice little squeeze going on right now, by the way. "
"317980","321040"," Um, this is what I want to show you here."
"322660","324980"," Because we all trade on different timelines."
"326860","331060"," And we all trade, like some people trade on, uh, they ask me questions, like you bearish or you're"
"331060","331260"," bullish. "
"331980","335700"," We'll ask you things like that and they'll say, and then they'll, you know, like we trade a one"
"335700","337340"," minute chart, sometimes a five minute chart."
"337900","341420"," Uh, they have to kind of pull back a little bit and see where we are in the market, right?"
"343100","344760"," Now this right now is a 30 minute chart."
"344880","348100"," I like this chart because the stock market tends to trade. "
"349100","354180"," On an hourly, uh, but on the half hour, the 15 minute, right?"
"354420","357680"," But it's like nine 30 until 10 30, 10 30 to 11 30."
"357880","359560"," So like the hour, I like the hour for trend."
"359700","362400"," I actually like the, uh, for like a super trend for our chart. "
"362660","364040"," I like that a lot as well."
"364600","368960"," Uh, but I'm looking at a chart, uh, for, for trend for over a period of time."
"369460","372500"," And deciding what, uh, tool you're going to use. "
"373300","376480"," In whether we're bearish or bullish."
"377800","383360"," If the market is supportive to buying, uh, or we have squeezes, but we're selling rips."
"384200","386540"," I tend to follow this, the yellow line right here. "
"387000","388400"," Uh, this is your daily trend."
"389780","397880"," And, uh, markets tend to, uh, when they're above or below, uh, prices below, we're trending down"
"397880","399980"," for prices above or trending up."
"399980","407200"," Uh, and oftentimes you'll get great interaction off of the hourly and the daily. "
"407780","409960"," And this is the green line right here is the hourly."
"411200","414360"," And you can actually kind of see sometimes too when we're bottoming out."
"414600","416700"," Very simply, even without looking at velocity. "
"417500","422960"," You can just, you can start to see a bottoming process and then on a negative and a topping process"
"422960","424720"," up here on positive, right?"
"424880","425560"," You can kind of see that."
"425560","430560"," Um, some kind of a bottoming process here, some kind of a topping process here, right?"
"431780","436800"," And you can also see, uh, when you start to get some confirmation once you're above, right?"
"437500","442280"," Um, and you like confirmation that you get to squeeze higher to a positive, uh, aspect."
"442540","447060"," And then you have some kind of a confirmation that you're going to continue to go up, right?"
"447540","451020"," You know that you can buy these dips on the hourly, right?"
"451020","456340"," So if we fall back to, uh, let's say we're above the daily and we, now, as a matter of"
"456340","458300"," fact, the spy right now sucks really bad. "
"458420","459300"," That's peace sucks, right?"
"459700","464440"," Whereas if I show you the Q's chart or if I show you a big tech chart, uh, how, how"
"464440","467060"," a ticker looks more bullish than other tickers."
"467060","473880"," I've shown you Tesla versus Apple Tesla versus Nvidia and what a healthy stock looks like versus"
"473880","475520"," something that's not as healthy."
"476200","482200"," And so just this green and yellow right here, uh, kind of gives you a perspective of where we are,"
"482200","483360"," uh, in trend. "
"484940","491200"," And just right now for the S&P 500, you can see that we're selling off of that daily, right?"
"491780","495800"," We're taking the opportunity to have a topping process going back back over here, right?"
"495960","500660"," We had this nice little run up here and we sell down and they're selling down and they're"
"500660","502580"," attempting to still sell down here."
"502580","503120"," You see that?"
"504580","509340"," And we're looking for some kind of a bottoming here to break above trend."
"509920","512340"," This daily and become bullish again. "
"512860","514179"," And even into yesterday's close."
"515080","516200"," Uh, we were closing yesterday."
"517020","518679"," Uh, I was asked, hey, you bullish or bear share?"
"518780","522179"," And I was like, yeah, it's really not a place for us to trade, uh, into this close. "
"522580","526040"," Well, no, well, I guess the last 15 minutes, like, yeah, we're going to squeeze up right here, but"
"526040","531280"," can't really take a trade with confidence, uh, as a bull until you get above there."
"531280","535720"," And you can kind of see how that played out, uh, into this morning's open, right?"
"536560","541140"," Futures and what we talked about this yesterday to the close, uh, that futures trade is going to"
"541140","543060"," look to be selling off of this in the overnight."
"543060","545020"," And that's what they did this morning, right?"
"545900","549840"," And so even right now, uh, this is a few things that we're looking for. "
"550680","551780"," So are we bottoming?"
"552200","553540"," Is the market bottoming?"
"553860","556680"," What is this price matter in this market bottoming process?"
"558100","559980"," And we'll take a look at it right here."
"559980","561120"," This is a 30 minute chart, right?"
"561180","562480"," It's going back into August."
"563100","564480"," All the way back into August here. "
"564840","566300"," And so we have a lower low here."
"566400","572200"," This is back on, um, October 17th, I think, somewhere in the 20th, I think the 17th was the big,"
"572280","572860"," or it was September."
"573560","575680"," In October, then we've got, uh, December here. "
"575980","577600"," We don't quite have a low yet."
"577960","580020"," So it's like a higher low, higher low, higher low."
"580060","583000"," So on a larger time frame, uh, this is kind of bullish, right?"
"583960","586300"," Uh, we have a low here, right?"
"586440","587920"," We got a high, new high, right?"
"587920","588820"," We got a higher low. "
"589160","590320"," We got a new high here."
"590460","592880"," We haven't quite gotten a new low down here."
"593040","595400"," So a longer time frame, it's still kind of bullish. "
"596300","600900"," Uh, the S&B 500 is still kind of bullish regardless of what you like to say or what bear"
"600900","603100"," likes to say, or even a bull likes to say."
"603280","606540"," It's still overall over time, uh, bullish here."
"606700","609800"," And you know that people want to get a low in the market right now. "
"610120","612240"," You hear people out there saying they want to get a low in the market."
"612500","614660"," You can see sellers trying to sell this market here."
"614660","617060"," We're going to go, go into some cycles in this. "
"617480","619300"," At some point this morning, we're going to talk about cycles."
"619840","621300"," And this is what it's all leading into is cycles."
"622640","625780"," And we haven't quite seen that bottoming process yet down here, right?"
"625900","626900"," You can actually see in velocity. "
"627880","628820"," This is just a daily."
"629560","631380"," Uh, you can see it's nice bottoming down here."
"631520","632860"," You can see it's nice bottoming down here. "
"633180","635380"," And you're kind of looking for signs of that right now."
"635880","638940"," Uh, over here for this part of this cycle, you kind of bottom out."
"639160","640720"," We also know that we're coming into April. "
"640980","643260"," This is one of the strongest months in the entire year."
"643740","645840"," Where you think March is strong."
"646320","652100"," You're actually looking for a bottom in March and April, um, traditionally to, uh, buy into"
"652100","652320"," strength. "
"653340","655900"," Uh, and then we can come in and it's usually becoming a cycle in summer."
"656340","658280"," That's kind of like a slow, slow thing, right?"
"658520","659700"," You take naps in the summertime."
"660180","664640"," Uh, you'll notice people that people at day trade are like, not enough in the middle of the day. "
"665220","667520"," Uh, looking for an entry, a buyer saw this market."
"667960","669580"," And so you kind of expect that."
"669580","676360"," Now what we're going to layer that over to with, um, cycles and debt cycles and some of the signs"
"676360","677560"," that we're seeing out there. "
"677800","681420"," And we're going to talk about the Fed as well and how they're impacting that right now."
"681920","684020"," Um, and you know, do we get this?"
"684200","686460"," I've been asked about the JPM caller."
"686880","687600"," JPM caller. "
"687600","689840"," We've got two actual magnets."
"690280","691580"," Well, potential magnets."
"692120","694680"," We've got a magnet above at four zero six zero. "
"694900","697480"," And then we have a magnet down at like thirty six hundred or something."
"697480","702660"," And the more that we trade up here, the less that magnet impacts on the low down here at thirty"
"702660","703220"," six hundred."
"703580","709560"," Uh, we tend to, we'll tend to want to actually, uh, be attracted to that four zero six zero on"
"709560","709860"," high. "
"710300","711980"," Uh, maybe trade sideways here."
"712340","715940"," And if you start to see this bottoming process take place, I'm going to show this on another chart"
"715940","716440"," here too."
"716920","718440"," Um, why price here?"
"719180","721400"," I'd be wary of a downward move at this point. "
"721760","725160"," And even if we get a downward move here at this point, let's say we get a bottoming."
"725740","729500"," Uh, and I'm going to show you back in some other, some previous bottoms."
"729980","733040"," Uh, you might get some kind of a deep bottom at some point. "
"733560","735320"," Uh, and it could be very fast."
"735360","738840"," Like, uh, if you're long a stock, I would not sell in that moment."
"739060","743460"," If you saw like a two or three day, uh, plunge here for a moment, I would not sell. "
"743780","747880"," I would stay in your position because it's likely going to swing right back on high again."
"748160","751320"," I wouldn't be something permanent likely, probability wise."
"752020","754120"," Uh, but I don't see a probability of this even happening. "
"754120","760340"," I doubt this happens, but if it does, uh, we have some kind of brief moments in the next month"
"760340","760700"," or two."
"761780","762880"," I don't even know if it's two."
"763080","765980"," I would say the end of this month into June or into April. "
"766560","768600"," You may, but it may not happen."
"769240","771940"," Uh, now, now remember that I say this here."
"773200","775180"," That's important that you remember that I say this here. "
"775420","779420"," And I'm going to show you a couple of other things here that are important for you to, um, to"
"779420","779940"," look at here."
"780540","781580"," Uh, so hold on a second."
"781580","782900"," I'm just going to find this here. "
"784220","790720"," Uh, cycles, uh, YouTube unnamed."
"792320","793180"," No blow to layout."
"794060","796060"," I'm going to find out a layout here for you. "
"797960","800260"," All the Macarean need and BI."
"800520","801500"," We're going to look at a couple of things here."
"804500","805200"," See that again. "
"805480","808700"," So, so on the first off on the, on the, on the market breath, right?"
"810820","811260"," Daily."
"811720","813040"," We're going to do an auto here."
"814820","818520"," And I want to show you, uh, just market breath here. "
"819080","819700"," Just briefly."
"819760","821140"," We're going to look at a couple of things here."
"821800","823080"," We're only a market breath here. "
"823340","825260"," And I want you to see this low down here."
"825340","828620"," This is back on, uh, Monday the 13th March."
"829040","831080"," You're always looking for a spring low to buy. "
"832060","833580"," And we had a low here."
"834100","835920"," It was a higher low back on March 13th."
"835920","837320"," And we got all the way down here. "
"838040","841280"," Uh, way down here in market breath."
"841880","844780"," And, you know, it's not like we can't come back down here."
"846020","847320"," Uh, maybe retest. "
"847720","851500"," But my point here is that even if we retest here, what is that retest?"
"851680","852440"," Is it down here?"
"852940","855560"," Uh, three eight four zero."
"855560","856840"," This is a yes, by the way."
"857380","858140"," Three eight four zero. "
"858800","860600"," Uh, three, three eight maybe a retest."
"860840","862640"," And then we're go, we're off and running for spring time."
"863020","866260"," So just price wise, I'm questioning how deep we go. "
"866260","871100"," If there was a quick plunge here, I'd be holding just to continue for that continuation higher."
"871520","873160"," But even with breath here, it's rare."
"873320","874540"," Sometimes we will get oversold. "
"875080","877600"," We will get oversold to some crazy low."
"878180","882460"," But just right now, I'm not seeing that low, that real low price we were talking about."
"882840","885560"," And that magnet is not really affecting the JPM caller. "
"886080","890700"," And we have to look for the JPM caller where it says on the 31st that comes out in next"
"890700","891160"," week, right?"
"891160","898360"," So we'll find out where the, where the market is going to be hedged to, uh, or, or in volatility"
"898360","902220"," crush to where banks want to see the market trade to."
"902660","908060"," And, um, you know, you might say that color doesn't hear people all the time in social media, like,"
"908300","909540"," JPM caller doesn't matter."
"909820","913680"," The truth is that they place that trade and it's not a large trade, but other people follow that"
"913680","913940"," trade. "
"914860","920180"," Another banks also try to limit volatility in the market through the options market on hedging."
"920800","924620"," Uh, they don't like, uh, volatile markets, believe it or not."
"924720","928700"," You think that they do hedge funds do, but not, not prime banks. "
"928800","930700"," They like that sideways and up slowly over time."
"931940","934680"," And so this is kind of lending itself to that, that idea."
"936420","938940"," Another thing that I want to, you'll want you to pay attention to here. "
"939000","940200"," We're going to go back to SPX."
"942580","945900"," Another thing that I want you to pay attention to here is."
"949640","950120"," Okay. "
"950500","954920"," Another thing that I want to pay you to pay attention to here is, um, we'll close this up here."
"956480","961200"," Another thing that I want you to pay attention to here is, um, hold on here."
"963040","964480"," Just one second here. "
"998160","998640"," Thanks."
"998920","998940"," Okay."
"998940","999440"," Okay. "
"999460","1000420"," This is SPX."
"1003980","1007380"," Another thing I want you to think about here is so the, here's the, these three yellows here."
"1007520","1011240"," This all has to do with, uh, quarters that we have, like, have coming down the road. "
"1012600","1015100"," But I want you to pay attention to something else here."
"1015160","1017420"," And this is, uh, the SPX."
"1018960","1023220"," And, uh, price percent oscillator price, uh, momentum oscillators. "
"1024240","1027140"," And as we're coming into this end of quarter here."
"1027140","1033740"," Uh, you're going to be expecting, you can kind of start to see some kind of a bottoming here."
"1034680","1036900"," And there's some kind of a bottoming here as well. "
"1037440","1039079"," And you've got a new quarter coming out."
"1039480","1043560"," And, you know, you could have this moment that you're trying to find a bottom into the 31st."
"1044099","1046540"," Uh, look for some kind of a move higher. "
"1047160","1050100"," So you have this bottoming here into the end of quarter."
"1050720","1053700"," And then some kind of an idea that we're going to be going up here."
"1054240","1057480"," Uh, into, uh, the next quarter. "
"1058460","1061360"," Whether that, whether that's 420, 430, 440."
"1062320","1063860"," Uh, there's some, some high projections here."
"1064040","1066440"," Right, best quarter of the year we should be coming into right now. "
"1068910","1070850"," Okay, my phone is blowing up this morning."
"1071930","1075310"," Uh, so we should be looking for a bottom to buy."
"1075550","1076370"," And here is my point. "
"1076670","1079190"," And you can see that with just the motions of the market."
"1079950","1084970"," Um, and I want to show you this too on some other time frames here in a weekly time frame."
"1084970","1090170"," Uh, this right here is scaring me on a weekly. "
"1091070","1092910"," And this is, this is where we're coming up here."
"1093030","1094690"," We have nice big push up here in a weekly."
"1094990","1095770"," And this is SPX. "
"1096250","1098210"," And then do we actually roll down?"
"1098470","1100530"," And this is the, that moment where I'm scared of."
"1100690","1103090"," This is the one where I'm like, man, do we get that bleed off."
"1104290","1106430"," Into this quarter instead of coming up. "
"1107030","1107250"," Right."
"1107390","1109210"," So the daily saying, yeah, everything is good for."
"1109770","1113790"," Uh, everything is good for, for, uh, for. "
"1114640","1115790"," Two, two."
"1116730","1120010"," But weekly saying, ah, there's still risk down below here."
"1122670","1124350"," And so that risk still presents itself. "
"1125310","1129850"," Uh, so as we're coming into this new quarter, I want you to be paying attention to."
"1130270","1136770"," Uh, what the JPM color, color is signaling to you for Q two."
"1137870","1139340"," In, uh, in 2023. "
"1140230","1145270"," Uh, does this get negated, negated here by the caller or does the caller saying, yeah, you know"
"1145270","1146670"," what, we might actually come down here."
"1147530","1151550"," Uh, so just on a weekly basis, this, this still lends me some concern."
"1152070","1156410"," On a monthly basis, there's still some concern here, right?"
"1156910","1159870"," So just looking at a monthly basis on PPO PMOs. "
"1160370","1163730"," Uh, there could still be some bottoming to take place in here."
"1164250","1164770"," You see this?"
"1165190","1166150"," So the daily looks fine."
"1166430","1170530"," The month of the daily looks fine, but the weekly and the monthly is saying, ah, there's still some"
"1170530","1173770"," risk to the downside here in Q two, two, three. "
"1173770","1177010"," And we know the Fed is kind of putting a damper on that, right?"
"1177170","1178270"," They threw a wrench on this thing."
"1178330","1178890"," We're going to extend."
"1179590","1180970"," Um, and we fucked up. "
"1181070","1184150"," We're not fucked up, but we're, we're sloshing money around the system."
"1184150","1186150"," That could impact this weekly and monthly."
"1187090","1188890"," Now I want to show you this too. "
"1189530","1218040"," I want to show"
"1218040","1218720"," you something else here."
"1218720","1220180"," This is a SPX still."
"1221320","1223580"," I need to, I need you to see this with me. "
"1238940","1242380"," So just looking at just, this is SPX right here."
"1243980","1246320"," And we're on a weekly chart right now."
"1246400","1248780"," We're going to move to a 30 minute chart. "
"1257910","1260950"," And I want you to watch something with me on this 30 minute chart."
"1261090","1264470"," I want you to see that the, this is the daily velocity."
"1264470","1267130"," Daily velocity is looking like it's bottoming. "
"1267210","1270510"," This is showing you that we're hopefully at a bottom on daily velocity."
"1271010","1272490"," We're going to make a move higher from here."
"1273070","1274210"," This is weekly velocity. "
"1274470","1275870"," It's actually beginning to improve."
"1276250","1280850"," This is going against what PPOs and PPMs are saying."
"1281090","1284030"," But the monthly is not improved as of yet. "
"1285570","1287490"," And this is the one that's concerning me."
"1288230","1291810"," As price goes up here, I want you to see that price is going up."
"1291910","1292610"," It's back in October. "
"1292610","1298670"," Price is going to new highs, lower lows, higher highs, and higher lows here."
"1299330","1306650"," But velocity is waning on the downside over here on the monthly, which is still showing us."
"1307710","1309970"," We're coming into the month right now is why I'm saying this. "
"1310130","1314770"," As we close out this month, I'm interested to see if velocity ends on the upside."
"1315690","1321390"," If we pin to that 4000 or if we actually start pinning lower into the end of this month, I"
"1321390","1322850"," don't want to see velocity."
"1325350","1329650"," I don't want to see velocity continue to drop lower here. "
"1330630","1333370"," On higher timeframes like down like this."
"1333610","1337670"," And the reason I'm saying that to you is because I'm going to show it to you at the lead"
"1337670","1338110"," up here."
"1341210","1346870"," This is December of 2021 right here. "
"1347750","1354250"," And you can actually track back in this is October, I believe September right here."
"1354610","1358850"," You can actually track right here when we were at a peak of velocity on the monthly."
"1360030","1364690"," You can actually see velocity coming down before price came down. "
"1365170","1366490"," Watch how it comes down here."
"1367310","1372870"," And it actually even though sweet a price divergence while velocity was heading down."
"1377950","1382690"," And it's telling you that the banks are not buying any of this. "
"1383150","1386990"," That price is being supported by no liquidity in the market."
"1387790","1393550"," And as we head down into into right now, we're heading down, down, down, down."
"1393550","1398190"," But we're not below the zero line into negativity yet, but we're heading down there, even though"
"1398190","1399770"," prices coming up now. "
"1400470","1402450"," Velocity is trailing off."
"1402730","1405070"," So there's a divergence still in velocity."
"1405850","1411950"," And the divergent says a divergent still in velocity to the market and price. "
"1413070","1416670"," Now, so underneath the market, there's a liquidity crisis."
"1417530","1419770"," And you can actually see it before it happens."
"1419770","1421590"," So this still is here. "
"1421890","1427610"," This risk to the market to the downside is still presenting itself."
"1428550","1434470"," At least on these charts that they can see that higher timeframes monthly is weaklies are all"
"1434470","1435130"," really bad."
"1436290","1437550"," And they're not improving. "
"1438070","1442350"," We had a little bit of improvement here, but price is not falling and is a bull."
"1442550","1449930"," You need to see price follow and improvement begin on higher timeframes and not seeing that outside"
"1449930","1451210"," of like daily stuff."
"1451710","1456210"," And a weekly you're seeing it starting to see it on weekly stuff, but not on the monthly. "
"1456210","1460930"," So and that February close was not good for velocity over time."
"1461430","1465430"," And it's not good ending into this month right now."
"1465670","1471170"," So if you're a bull or a bear, you want to really pay attention to two things heading into the"
"1471170","1477390"," end of this month, which is that JPM caller and our closing price on an end of month and where"
"1477390","1478410"," we wind up there. "
"1481640","1483520"," Hold on, I'm going to move some of this stuff over here."
"1484920","1486700"," Hold on, then we're going to get into the cycles."
"1490410","1494470"," Now, if you want my take on where we where we close this month on the end of next week,"
"1495110","1501270"," we really want to see that pin on SPX specifically near 4060. "
"1501630","1508130"," I want to see SPX in there on end of month on the 31st of this month for 060 on"
"1508130","1508430"," the close."
"1510170","1510650"," Absolutely."
"1511030","1516790"," And then I want to see the JPM caller come out with a hedge that's somewhere around 42430 somewhere"
"1516790","1517470"," in there, minimum. "
"1518010","1525510"," Matter of fact, minimum would be four or four twenty four four two zero zero for SPX."
"1525990","1531490"," If I start to see a range that's much much much much lower, that's going to take into account that"
"1531490","1538410"," liquidity crisis that we're having in the markets right now."
"1538410","1543910"," For the next quarter, it's your due diligence out there, whether you're a bull or a bear to be"
"1543910","1551910"," hyper aware of what that JPM caller is to where prices at the end of the month and where the"
"1551910","1554570"," expectation on the market is for the next quarter. "
"1555270","1557170"," And that's going to lead us into cycles."
"1558650","1560410"," That's going to lead us into cycle."
"1560570","1561750"," And I think we get this pin here. "
"1561810","1563970"," You can see we're not selling down in the depths of hell."
"1563970","1570550"," Right now looks like the market should be bought up into a pin on the 31st for 4060."
"1570950","1577930"," You could see moments, of course, of re-hedging in the market where we see weakness into the 31st. "
"1579010","1584710"," Usually large size trades will come in on the 31st and you'll see like a blast down for 45 minutes."
"1584890","1586610"," You know, people are like, don't trade this day."
"1587510","1591530"," You'll see blasts coming into into indexes specifically. "
"1592170","1594370"," I wouldn't be shocked to see that in tech briefly."
"1595310","1599510"," But tech to me, we're going to talk about why tech's going to be strong into the next quarter."
"1600290","1605730"," We're going to talk about why we have some issues and SPX and spy and why we're seeing the"
"1605730","1608130"," mechanics of the movement of spy the way that it is. "
"1610510","1614810"," And in my point here is that what is the low, right?"
"1615050","1618090"," I guess that's the big question out there is the low on spy right now."
"1618610","1623170"," I guess this is the low on spy down here or even down here and maybe we go up into"
"1623170","1625270"," 4060 into the 31st."
"1625270","1629670"," And even if we get a hedge on the market, it doesn't blast down to down here to 389. "
"1630210","1633170"," But this might be the low into Q2."
"1635770","1640610"," And it's important for you to look at these cycles on higher timeframes because in the background,"
"1640610","1643150"," things still look like dog shit."
"1643410","1643610"," They do. "
"1644210","1648090"," The weekly is improving, but the monthly still looks like dog shit."
"1649130","1650450"," And this could be the same."
"1650630","1652690"," I posted this on Twitter a week ago. "
"1652910","1655750"," I said, you hedge the market and you trade it up."
"1656390","1658870"," But we might still need a hedge is my point here."
"1659330","1664950"," As we get into the 31st, any kind of positioning that you have of size, because I'm talking of"
"1664950","1667910"," friends that are like, Hey man, I'm sized in six figures. "
"1668070","1669270"," I'm a size in seven figures."
"1670130","1674930"," My friends are like, I've hedged in for five figures, six figures, stuff like that."
"1676110","1681450"," And so this is important to people that make their livelihoods doing this. "
"1682230","1685590"," As we head into this being a Friday, not saying in the last week, I think it's kind of important"
"1685590","1686610"," for us to review this stuff."
"1687770","1691770"," We're going to talk about cycles, sector cycles and stuff like that."
"1691950","1698730"," I think, I think, you know, I wish I wish I had some time to have asked Mike Silva to"
"1698730","1700830"," come on the program to talk about this stuff. "
"1701250","1705630"," Because I think he's been like, he's been doing a series about this stuff over the past couple"
"1705630","1705850"," weeks."
"1706590","1709610"," So I'm going to give him some credit here on this for sure."
"1709970","1711370"," And then also we're going to talk about it. "
"1712830","1714450"," Let me see, I'm bringing up here in the background."
"1716010","1717570"," We're going to look at some cool stuff today."
"1725380","1727080"," And we're also going to be using this. "
"1730540","1733360"," We're also going to be using stock charts.com."
"1734740","1735980"," You guys know stock charts."
"1735980","1737020"," You guys know Larry Williams."
"1737400","1739200"," You guys know Mike Silva out there. "
"1740100","1744320"," I'm going to play this in the background and we're going to look at as I play this audio in"
"1744320","1746160"," the background sector rotation analysis."
"1747680","1752520"," Sector rotation system attempts to link current strengths and weaknesses in the stock market with"
"1752520","1757360"," the general business cycle based on the relative performance of the nine sand sector SPDR ETFs."
"1758180","1762640"," Once you have identified the strong and weak sectors, you can then compare the results to a"
"1762640","1767540"," theoretical business cycle chart and, hopefully, determine the part of the business cycle the"
"1767540","1768140"," market is in. "
"1768680","1773280"," That information, in turn, may help you predict which sectors will strengthen in the coming weeks"
"1773280","1773800"," and months."
"1775280","1776300"," The business cycle."
"1777160","1782280"," The graph below shows the idealized business cycle and the intermarket relationships during a"
"1782280","1783500"," normal inflationary environment. "
"1783500","1787900"," This cycle map is based on one shown in the intermarket review by Martin J."
"1788160","1790920"," Pring, www.pring.com."
"1791540","1793480"," The business cycle is shown as a sine wave."
"1794040","1798860"," The first three stages are part of an economic contraction, weakening, bottoming and strengthening."
"1799560","1804260"," Stage three shows the economy in a contraction phase, beginning to strengthen after a bottom. "
"1804900","1809860"," As the sine wave crosses the center line, the economy moves from contraction to the three phases of"
"1809860","1812840"," economic expansion, strengthening, topping and weakening."
"1812840","1817960"," Stage six shows the economy in an expansion phase, starting to weaken after a top."
"1820180","1824780"," Stage one shows the economy contracting in bonds, turning up as interest rates decline. "
"1825440","1830520"," Economic weakness favors loose monetary policy and the lowering of interest rates, which is bullish"
"1830520","1831140"," for bonds."
"1831140","1835340"," I wanted to look at this stage two positive in the economy and the stock."
"1838520","1847860"," Stage one shows the economy contracting in bonds, turning up as interest rates decline. "
"1848900","1856380"," Now we know that the Fed futures fund rate, we know that the bond market is telling you, no matter"
"1856380","1862520"," what the Fed is saying, they're going to start ratcheting back rate."
"1863740","1867880"," Economic weakness favors loose monetary policy and the lowering of interest rates, which is bullish"
"1867880","1868540"," for bonds."
"1868840","1869940"," We're going to look at TLT today. "
"1871100","1873840"," Stage two marks the bottom of the economy and the stock market."
"1874000","1877800"," Key point here marks a bottom in the economy and the stock market."
"1878440","1881240"," So on a weekly time frame, everything looks fine. "
"1882100","1885700"," On a daily time frame, everything looks fine for Q2."
"1887780","1891240"," On a monthly time frame, though, it's not looking so good as it."
"1891440","1894940"," On a monthly time frame, it's not looking as healthy. "
"1895580","1897940"," This kind of looks like stage one so far, right?"
"1898560","1902000"," And we're possibly looking forward into stage two."
"1902180","1905560"," Stage two marks a bottom in the economy and the stock market."
"1906140","1909900"," We're not going to look at stage three at this moment, four and five. "
"1910120","1911980"," We are going to look at stage six marks."
"1913620","1918020"," Stage six marks the deterioration in the economy as the business cycle prepares to move from an"
"1918020","1920580"," expansion phase to a contraction phase."
"1920580","1925340"," Stocks have already been moving lower and commodities now turn lower in anticipation of decreased"
"1925340","1927720"," demand for deteriorating economy. "
"1928700","1933760"," You remember a week or two ago, I was like, hey, when you see a month ago, I was like,"
"1933900","1934860"," I was bearish on oil."
"1934920","1936040"," I'm bearish on oil here."
"1936960","1939400"," And I'm like, and people are like, I'm bullish on oil. "
"1939580","1941040"," You need that for the S&B 500 to go up."
"1941100","1942140"," And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no."
"1942680","1943860"," We're at the end of this shit. "
"1944020","1945780"," You're going to see commodities just nose dive."
"1945940","1948060"," And we saw oil just blast down."
"1948400","1953260"," Another key point here is you saw financials blast down. "
"1954920","1958640"," And you've seen the TLT right by a dip comes up."
"1958760","1961300"," Go back down by a dip goes back up comes back down."
"1961460","1964840"," And you're looking for that last part of TLT to blast north, right?"
"1964840","1966560"," That's that key point, right?"
"1967040","1969600"," That would mark the bottom, right?"
"1969680","1970420"," That's stage two. "
"1971100","1972560"," The marks the bottom, right?"
"1973780","1976120"," And then we're going to look at sector rotation here."
"1976280","1981680"," Unsurprisingly, the business cycle influences the rotation of stock market sectors and industry"
"1981680","1982100"," groups."
"1982800","1986880"," Certain sectors perform better than others during specific phases of the business cycle. "
"1987860","1994500"," Knowing the stage of the business cycle can help investors position themselves in the right sectors"
"1994500","1995840"," and avoid the wrong ones."
"1996800","2000560"," Now, you've seen real estate just get annihilated, right?"
"2001720","2009000"," You've seen utilities did kind of well, but you've seen like, you've seen XLP, it's kind of"
"2009000","2010080"," floating sideways, right?"
"2010920","2015820"," Whenever we're in a crash, fear or scare, you see them kind of get bumped up again and you see"
"2015820","2017260"," some risk put on in tech."
"2018320","2020260"," You've seen financials get wrecked. "
"2020260","2025120"," And what are you seeing over here is tech being bought."
"2025420","2027080"," And we focus here on S&P 500."
"2028480","2029880"," Discretionary being bought. "
"2030420","2032680"," Communication services being bought."
"2033160","2035660"," We don't see industrials yet being bought doing."
"2036440","2038480"," Industrials look like they're on a cliff, don't they?"
"2039280","2041360"," Like they have a little bit more to go down, right?"
"2041860","2044000"," So as you saw, financials get wrecked. "
"2044840","2049460"," Maybe, I don't know, maybe industrials are fine, but it looks to me like it has a little bit more"
"2049460","2050199"," bottoming to do."
"2051219","2053440"," Now, the key point here is financials, right?"
"2053639","2056860"," Big question here is, do we buy financials here?"
"2057560","2063000"," And they're not quite in the point of buying them because we haven't hit a bottom in the market,"
"2063000","2063280"," right?"
"2064040","2068480"," We're going to actually expect financials to underperform for a period of time."
"2069040","2074340"," Whether it be three months or six months or nine months, they would probably underperform until the"
"2074340","2076260"," full market starts to rise. "
"2076260","2082540"," You'll actually see overperformance by technology, discretionary, commercial, communication"
"2082540","2085739"," services, and then lead into industrials."
"2085840","2089260"," That would mean that right now, you should probably be watching industrials."
"2090239","2093600"," We're not there yet, but the next one to three months start watching that. "
"2093719","2097440"," And also, be aware, we probably haven't hit a bottom yet in the market."
"2098340","2101820"," Okay, we still probably haven't seen the S&P 500 at a bottom."
"2101820","2111640"," And we will probably see some kind of divergence between some of these sectors here and the S&P"
"2111640","2111940"," 500. "
"2112280","2118940"," We as a channel might need to shift to focusing on consumer discretionary, technology,"
"2119740","2125260"," communication services, and then be eyeballing industrials and materials later on and be looking"
"2125260","2127440"," for this bottom over time in the S&P 500."
"2127440","2132960"," Maybe showing the S&P 500 and logging some of these sectors for the next month or two or three."
"2133340","2135780"," And I want to talk to you about financials specifically here. "
"2136600","2139860"," And I want to show you why I'm talking about financials today, okay?"
"2140660","2142140"," So I want to start with this."
"2142300","2143320"," I'm going to move this over here."
"2143420","2147820"," And I want to talk to you about, let me see if I can bring this up again here. "
"2150770","2152050"," Get rid of these two here."
"2152390","2155910"," And I want to show you, I'm going to trash all of these drawings here."
"2159130","2160530"," I'm going to go back to a daily. "
"2162490","2164030"," I'm going to show you some stuff here."
"2170340","2171740"," Okay, so this is the S&P 500."
"2172760","2174280"," Let me see if I can delete some of this stuff. "
"2174980","2175740"," Moving average."
"2176860","2178580"," Yeah, man, we have some basic stuff here."
"2179140","2181280"," And people say that COVID doesn't matter. "
"2181640","2182980"," You can actually follow this."
"2183380","2186640"," I'll bring that chart, but that stock charts thing back up again for you."
"2186640","2190540"," But just even just even COVID, people are like, this doesn't matter. "
"2190620","2191200"," It actually does."
"2191700","2196120"," We still followed what actually happens in every cycle."
"2196120","2197400"," It was just going to sped up timeline. "
"2198180","2200260"," So I want you to look at XLF here."
"2201920","2203980"," Let me see if this do this on a new pane down below."
"2205600","2208020"," And I want you to pay attention to something closely here. "
"2209040","2210160"," I want you to see."
"2212140","2212920"," No, no, no."
"2212920","2217570"," I want you to see something here. "
"2217670","2224390"," I want you to see that XLF at this bottom under performed for a period of time."
"2225810","2227110"," Until late cycle."
"2227610","2230410"," I want you to see this because I want you to also see. "
"2232350","2234970"," Let's do the cues in a new pane."
"2236510","2238430"," I want you to see this here."
"2238630","2243250"," I want you to see that you see an under performance from XLF over here, right?"
"2243250","2247270"," And then once we get into the peak cycle, XLF just rips and takes off. "
"2247810","2253130"," So if we focus on XLF, if we are at a bottom, it is some kind of a bottoming process."
"2254370","2261970"," You would see, you would end up seeing XLF maybe under performed next three to six months."
"2262230","2264830"," It will rocket ship, but it's going to under perform. "
"2265450","2268170"," You're going to see consolidation and then eventual rip."
"2268790","2270850"," So should we be paying attention to XLF right now?"
"2270970","2271550"," I don't know."
"2273350","2275630"," Do I think you can buy a bottom here in XLF?"
"2276850","2277290"," Yes. "
"2277710","2282170"," Do I think your expectation should be I'm going to start printing money right now?"
"2282510","2283210"," Probably not."
"2285170","2287810"," You can see this tick March to April of 2020."
"2288010","2290090"," And you can actually look back into other times. "
"2290470","2294690"," You can look back into 2008, 2008, 1986, 87, whatever, whatever you want to look."
"2294990","2296890"," 2018, 19, doesn't matter."
"2297310","2300290"," You're going to see XLF in this late cycle. "
"2301130","2303930"," Under perform and then kick in down the road."
"2304510","2309630"," But I do want you to see here that what did over perform, right?"
"2309750","2311490"," I know you don't want to be this guy."
"2311730","2312330"," I know you're out there. "
"2312430","2314590"," You're like, I don't fucking want to become a tech bull again."
"2315270","2317070"," But tech does over perform."
"2317470","2320050"," And we're already seeing tech over perform. "
"2320570","2323830"," You're already seeing tech over perform the S&P 500."
"2324490","2327970"," Like you're talking about a duck walking like a duck talking like a duck and that kind of stuff."
"2327970","2330410"," And you're asking yourself, what's over performing?"
"2331030","2332370"," And we're seeing it right now. "
"2332650","2336570"," You can actually see how our cues are over performing."
"2336810","2340450"," You can actually see how the slide some others in XLY XLC."
"2340890","2342770"," Let's look at XLY and XLC. "
"2344330","2344890"," XLY."
"2346590","2348190"," This is consumer discretionary."
"2349330","2349870"," Hold on here. "
"2351810","2352930"," Hold on a second here."
"2355670","2358930"," Okay, move it to a different move to a new pane below, new pane below."
"2360770","2362630"," And look at XLY, right?"
"2363230","2363610"," Performing. "
"2366230","2366610"," Right?"
"2366890","2372190"," This XLF is in the, XLF is in the orange, but you're seeing high performance from XLY."
"2373770","2375170"," Let me see if I can get rid of that one."
"2377010","2379550"," You can see, let me see if I can do XL. "
"2379550","2387010"," So XLC, communications, new pane."
"2388570","2390170"," And I want you to see this one right here."
"2390250","2395570"," See this high performance coming out while XLF kind of laggards sideways, right?"
"2397430","2402030"," And we're seeing, we're already seeing signs of that right now inside of this market. "
"2402990","2406530"," See how XLF is turning down and see how XLC is turning up."
"2406650","2407890"," All right, this is XLC turning up."
"2407890","2409930"," You're seeing cues turn up. "
"2410150","2413890"," You're seeing XLY turn up, pipe rod, XLY over here."
"2413890","2414550"," We're doing the same thing."
"2415830","2418530"," And we still, is this bottom?"
"2418750","2421090"," This still leaves us with, is this bottom?"
"2421310","2424470"," Because we are seeing XLC, tech turn up. "
"2424830","2426050"," Is this bottom in the spy?"
"2426350","2427450"," I think there's still risk here."
"2427750","2432230"," There's still risk to a lower low and spy itself."
"2432830","2434630"," But this could be bottom at the same time. "
"2434630","2443730"," So maybe we take this trade into Q2 for a long for spy, maybe SPX to go to 420, 430,"
"2444230","2446470"," 440 with a nice fat hedge on that trade."
"2447190","2451610"," That if I was going to take that trade into Q2, I'd be saying, hey, if I'm going to put"
"2451610","2457490"," 30 grand on, I'm going to put $30,000 on SPX going to 430 or 440."
"2457930","2462290"," Maybe I should shift that over to tech going higher instead of SPX. "
"2463610","2465670"," So I can get max gain on that trade."
"2465970","2469210"," I know some of you are like, we're going to short NVIDIA to the depths of hell."
"2469870","2472390"," But you might see tech outperform. "
"2472870","2478430"," And if you're going to put some risk on in the market for max gains, it's probably tech and not"
"2478430","2478710"," spy."
"2480470","2485770"," If you wanted max gains, higher probability if we are in this place that tech is going to over"
"2485770","2486090"," perform."
"2486090","2490830"," If the market actually crashes, I would maybe put a hedge on spy. "
"2491490","2497150"," So long queues, long queues short spy for Q2."
"2497970","2501850"," And I know this sounds insane to even talk about this because you might be like, hey, man, how can"
"2501850","2506630"," Apple be at 160 bucks and you're talking about trying to find a dip for Q2 on Apple?"
"2507190","2508190"," I know that sounds insane."
"2508350","2509130"," Maybe it's not Apple. "
"2509230","2509990"," Maybe it's just the queues."
"2510270","2511210"," Maybe it's just NDX."
"2512250","2515190"," At least I'm kind of looking for that max gains. "
"2515770","2516470"," I'm trying to capture."
"2517270","2518370"," Not that one there."
"2520840","2523700"," Maybe we actually haven't seen the end of XLC. "
"2524060","2528460"," Maybe XLC just keeps ripping higher into June, July, August, September."
"2529700","2533440"," While we're trying to figure this bullshit out in SPY."
"2533700","2536840"," And if the market crashes in this moment, I've got that protection for me on the downside. "
"2538320","2539480"," Because I'm trying to say it to you."
"2541880","2542680"," So, Q2."
"2544800","2547580"," I think the risk is still there for a major low. "
"2548380","2550380"," Probably still in some kind of a bottoming process."
"2551260","2555740"," If the hedge ever comes off spy, sure it'll squeeze to monster highs."
"2556160","2556860"," I don't disagree with that. "
"2557700","2559060"," But I don't think we've seen the end of it."
"2559140","2562900"," I don't think we've seen the end of XLF having to consolidate over time."
"2563340","2564680"," And maybe not joining into the party. "
"2565400","2566060"," If there is a party."
"2567200","2568960"," So maybe it's, yeah, I think that's what it is."
"2569040","2572160"," I think it's kind of like a, if you're going along something that's probably going to give you the"
"2572160","2575200"," best bang for the buck, probably tech for Q2. "
"2576000","2582920"," And it's probably, if you're going to hedge the market, it's probably either spy or some"
"2582920","2587500"," combination of spy or Dow Jones industrial average."
"2588380","2589660"," It's so high right now, right?"
"2589960","2591820"," It's the most easily shorted."
"2591820","2597140"," But I don't think we're done with SPY on the downside or where there is risk. "
"2597360","2599840"," It's mostly on the downside to spy."
"2600320","2602960"," And I've seen divergences in the past."
"2604100","2606200"," I'm not going to bring up the right now and get back to the market. "
"2606440","2610940"," But I've seen divergences in the past and bottoming processes where the spy does under perform."
"2611840","2612980"," As a matter of fact, you see you."
"2613080","2618560"," I just showed you the spy underperforming tech even when we hit bottom back here in 2020. "
"2619380","2624520"," You've seen a tech just for perform against even the spy in that bottoming process."
"2624740","2628760"," You might like to slow grind up and spy and you've got tech just blasting forward every single day."
"2630720","2636300"," So pay attention to that as we come into Q2 and Q3. "
"2636460","2643600"," You could see continuation here in the spy itself of sideways by dip cell rips"
"2643600","2649620"," by dip cell even into Q2."
"2651020","2652480"," That's sideways and up trade."
"2653260","2656700"," Trade trade one band up above and one band down below. "
"2657140","2658960"," Maybe get one low in the spy down at 360."
"2659480","2659880"," Woo hoo."
"2660220","2661480"," Market's going to burn in reality. "
"2662480","2665060"," You've got tech just flying for a quarter or two."
"2667000","2671100"," If you don't mind trading day trading the SPY for like fuck that cap."
"2671700","2675340"," I'm a smooth trader day in day out, baby. "
"2675440","2675860"," I don't care."
"2675860","2676960"," That's fine too."
"2677080","2682260"," But there are people out there that are looking for the direction of the market into this year. "
"2683440","2688040"," And we have one other thing we haven't looked at here yet, which is which is which is TLT and"
"2688040","2688500"," TLT."
"2689020","2693600"," You know, it's still TLT is still walking, talking like a duck, right?"
"2693780","2699800"," It's still I mean, I'm looking at TLC TLT here and it's just it's looking like it, right?"
"2700080","2701080"," Buy a bottom, sell the top."
"2701240","2704180"," Buy a bottom, sell the top and it's looking pretty bullish today, isn't it?"
"2705020","2708780"," The open today is looking like, hey, man, I want to rip faces off. "
"2709380","2710840"," I want to go up there and just smash."
"2712280","2712680"," Right."
"2712860","2713420"," And that's that. "
"2713560","2716500"," Well, that's that key indicator on the week on the monthly timeframe saying."
"2716840","2720700"," Yeah, there was still some risk to we haven't seen the lows on spy yet."
"2721040","2724060"," It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it's at least there in the background. "
"2733460","2738160"," So just I would say pay attention to that as we head into end of quarter."
"2738160","2746760"," Pay attention to what I'd be fascinating to see what JPM thinks about the risk to what the bottom"
"2746760","2747180"," is."
"2747340","2752960"," If JPM's like, yeah, we think we're going up and sort sideways enough or we think 360 is the bottom"
"2752960","2756220"," or we think 380 or even 400 or 4,000. "
"2756580","2758720"," 3,800 or 4,000 is the bottom."
"2759020","2764000"," That will give you some insight into when it's a very smart people and what their their thoughts"
"2764000","2768140"," are on risk into this market on that monthly going forward."
"2768140","2769440"," The next three months. "
"2772080","2774840"," Yeah, I saw that emergency meeting today with Yellen."
"2775260","2776960"," I saw that."
"2778380","2779980"," I saw that emergency meeting. "
"2782360","2787900"," No, you know, any of those, I'll tell you honestly, I don't give a flying off about any of the"
"2787900","2791540"," little hedges that come out during the quarter."
"2791800","2793460"," I only care about quarterly hedging."
"2794180","2796900"," Always every start and end of every quarter. "
"2796900","2798280"," Those are the big boys."
"2799100","2800740"," Those are the ones that I care about."
"2801040","2802120"," I don't care about the. "
"2802500","2807760"," I mean, I've tracked those hedging, but hedging that that end in like the following months."
"2808200","2812040"," But the quarterly to me is this is like the moves of the market."
"2812360","2817180"," So I'm looking for the 31st of March to see what comes out. "
"2818300","2821060"," That's the key and those that's what you want to be looking at."
"2822100","2823580"," Or at least in my experience."
"2824960","2826380"," Those are the ones that matter. "
"2827780","2830760"," They give you a they give you a little eyeglass into."
"2833620","2838580"," The the with the banks want the market to do they get run over on the top and down."
"2838700","2839940"," I agree with that that happens. "
"2840720","2844680"," They get run over, but you do want to see what their positioning is."
"2851970","2857260"," I hope that answers."
"2857540","2860080"," I said this was specific to someone was asking me this morning. "
"2860840","2862880"," A very close dear friend of mine."
"2863120","2865860"," It's in the stream right now that I care about."
"2866080","2870100"," Asked me this morning to what the my thoughts were in there. "
"2870340","2875360"," England's man says the Bank of England has got quite a way towards an appropriate level or monetary"
"2875360","2875940"," tightness."
"2876200","2880180"," So just to repeat that, Bank of England has got quite a way towards an appropriate level of"
"2880180","2881000"," monetary tightness."
"2881600","2886840"," If you're looking for how to find this chart that I showed you, you just go to Google and type"
"2886840","2888880"," in sector cycles stock market. "

"2920280","2921120"," Paul going to continue."
"2921540","2923680"," These are things that we don't know right J."
"2923800","2927380"," How we thought we were getting two more rate increases. "
"2928100","2930400"," That was the thought process right thought process."
"2930400","2931860"," We're going to get two more rate increases."
"2933340","2934280"," And we're done. "
"2936560","2938000"," You've got everybody out there."
"2938060","2939800"," Everybody is saying, no, no, no, no."
"2939820","2940460"," He's way done. "
"2940740","2942580"," He's cooked like no matter what he's saying."
"2943280","2945640"," And there was there are people that were trying to say."
"2946420","2950480"," Look at this look at this brief moment of the meeting where he said we're probably done raising"
"2950480","2950800"," rates. "
"2951260","2957380"," But then when he was exiting, when he was actually exiting his, his, uh, presser, he said, as he"
"2957380","2957800"," was walking up."
"2957920","2959520"," He's like, we ain't done raising rates."
"2960760","2961280"," So. "
"2962260","2963560"," I take it from that."
"2963640","2964040"," Well, you will."
"2964240","2965300"," For 25 basis. "
"2965320","2971240"," So far as the state, what he's doing inflation expectations expectations had started to moderate to"
"2971240","2971900"," just repeat that."
"2972240","2977420"," Bank of England's man says my vote for a 25 basis point rate rise this month was partly because"
"2977420","2979580"," inflation expectations had started to moderate."
"2981600","2986820"," He also said that his plans is the February retail sales data are pretty robust. "
"2988340","2996580"," He also said inside of his is some key points in his press or was the credit crunch will probably"
"2996580","2997800"," do the job for us."
"2998260","3001160"," People tried to rope him into saying that I mean, people really wanted to."
"3001240","3004600"," They're just like, they were just like, I want to say it's like a pretty bad word, but. "
"3005560","3010880"," You know, they're just trying to get him at any moment to say we're done raising rates, trying to"
"3010880","3012340"," go them into it, go to them into it."
"3012800","3014600"," They tried to go to them into it with the credit crunch."
"3015460","3018840"," But he did harp on some specific things, two key things. "
"3019420","3022280"," He said, yeah, the credit crunch might do it, but he said two key things."
"3022440","3025080"," He said, we want maximum employment."
"3026200","3030540"," And when he said that, he meant, and this is what I posted on Twitter saying you got to pay"
"3030540","3034460"," real close attention to employment numbers unemployment numbers. "
"3035740","3037820"," Because as long as they keep people employed."
"3037820","3044860"," And if he can continue to raise rates as long as people are working, so people are working and he"
"3044860","3045820"," can raise rates."
"3046720","3050180"," He knows that the economy is not going to crash at that point. "
"3050580","3054800"," So he may be trying to extend the time that he has to keep working."
"3054800","3056460"," He's trying to buy himself some time in there."
"3056940","3063080"," As long as people are working and paying for the supporting support of this of banks and then"
"3063080","3064940"," likely commercial real estate. "
"3064940","3066920"," We know that's probably number two."
"3067680","3073900"," And we already saw on that chart financials crash, we know that REITs are getting blasted down down"
"3073900","3075300"," to the depths of hell right now."
"3075800","3077260"," You're probably going to have to see. "
"3078160","3083980"," If you look at the real estate sectors, especially the commercial ones, they're getting blasted to"
"3083980","3085100"," the depths of hell."
"3085320","3092380"," At some point, you are going to see a crisis moment in commercial real estate."
"3092380","3094840"," Almost 100% assured. "
"3095060","3097400"," They're probably talking about that in that meeting right now."
"3097700","3101480"," Even though they're claiming it's about banking, it's probably about commercial real estate."
"3103280","3106860"," I'm going to gander that discussion is in that close meeting. "
"3107440","3111460"," And they don't want you knowing about England's man says this further to go before the tight"
"3111460","3112660"," conditions in the UK."
"3121320","3124020"," JPM Morgan, Morgan analysts on douche bank."
"3124220","3128620"," We believe that recent CDS widening is related to one way trades of derisking by all market"
"3128620","3129120"," participants. "
"3135620","3139800"," Bullard said today's situation is vastly different from that of 2007, 2009."
"3139920","3141480"," I agree with that statement too."
"3143000","3145880"," The timing of everything is all janky right now. "
"3146280","3147320"," Time is all over the place."
"3149080","3151320"," Not nothing is like COVID."
"3151980","3154380"," That's the one part about the COVID COVID. "
"3155280","3157180"," Time frame that's really fucked up."
"3157840","3161960"," We were not applying tools the right right time frames here."
"3175850","3176990"," Yeah, I'm bullish. "
"3177650","3183330"," But I'm so wheezy saying thanks caps cycles are very important Larry Williams, Tom Bauer, bullish"
"3183330","3184870"," Q2, according to their recent bids."
"3184870","3188050"," I haven't watched Larry Larry Williams, most recent stuff at all."
"3188530","3190770"," Jake Bernstein too, but no one has a crystal ball. "
"3190990","3192210"," I think it's not that we're not bullish."
"3192490","3193610"," I'm bullish on Q2."
"3193930","3196970"," It's identifying what to be most bullish in. "
"3197630","3201890"," And a lot of the noise out there right now is I'm going to short the fuck."
"3202030","3204330"," I'm going to short the fucking NVIDIA into the ground."
"3204970","3209490"," And I'm like, man, this reminds me of every bottom that I've seen in the past where. "
"3211370","3216330"," There's give back every last dollar they have trying to short what looks like the juiciest short."
"3216950","3220950"," They get back every fucking dollar they made as the market went down and they don't actually go"
"3220950","3221970"," after the S&P 500."
"3222590","3224310"," They end up going after like tech. "
"3224550","3227070"," They're like, I'm going to smash Apple to the depths of hell."
"3227330","3229670"," I'm going to smash small caps to the depths of hell."
"3229670","3230290"," I'm going to smash. "
"3231090","3235050"," I'm going to smash, you know, then video any all these companies."
"3235050","3239670"," It's like, whoa, you could probably short this market, but probably not what you think you can"
"3239670","3239930"," short."
"3240790","3241810"," This is my point here. "
"3253860","3255900"," I don't think I think that bulls will miss this too."
"3256140","3260800"," I think bulls, I think bulls are even like looking at NVIDIA as an example and saying that shit"
"3260800","3261540"," can't go up anymore."
"3261540","3262580"," And I'm like, I don't know. "
"3262860","3263500"," I think it might."
"3264340","3266820"," I think there's going to be some viable dips on NVIDIA."
"3267140","3271620"," I don't mean like you buy the top on NVIDIA by like the last two tops we have. "
"3271720","3274580"," I'm saying like, there's probably buyable dips on these companies."
"3276660","3277820"," Now, there's probably buyable dips."
"3278040","3279660"," We can actually look at some of them right now. "
"3279780","3280660"," We'll look at NVIDIA specifically."
"3284480","3288880"," And here's my point on this is, let me see if I can get this one up here for you."
"3291640","3292980"," To my point, I guess. "
"3303180","3309160"," To my point here would be, let's look at, I mean, just look at this."
"3309320","3310260"," This is spy, right?"
"3310720","3311960"," It's not looking that healthy, is it?"
"3312840","3313580"," This isn't looking healthy."
"3314040","3317900"," Just kind of consolidating around daily monthly weekly triggers. "
"3318860","3319420"," And let's look at it."
"3319500","3321480"," Let's look at something else that doesn't look too healthy."
"3322320","3323620"," This just doesn't look healthy. "
"3324880","3325660"," And here we go."
"3325880","3326940"," We got Tesla."
"3328460","3329820"," Not looking too healthy, is it?"
"3330440","3331120"," This is a tech company. "
"3332540","3333520"," High beta stock."
"3335100","3335540"," Consolidating."
"3335820","3336400"," Can it become healthy?"
"3336940","3337020"," Sure. "
"3338140","3341880"," Can Tesla start to look like early stages of NVIDIA?"
"3341880","3343080"," Sure, it can."
"3343360","3344060"," But is it there now?"
"3344340","3344820"," Fuck no."
"3345300","3347880"," Is it something that you're going to be putting tons of risk on for that?"
"3348120","3348540"," Hell no. "
"3349300","3354060"," You want the work done for you to then put real money into that trade higher on Tesla."
"3354800","3355800"," Like real money, real risk."
"3356300","3357620"," Real I make my living this way. "
"3357740","3363580"," I pay for my wife, my kids, my houses, my debt, my college loans, my not wanting to work a"
"3363580","3364940"," real job kind of stuff, right?"
"3365620","3366600"," So do you do that with Tesla?"
"3366820","3367020"," No."
"3367020","3377510"," But if you're looking at like NVIDIA or you're looking at an apple, look at"
"3377510","3378590"," how beautiful that looks."
"3379810","3380390"," It's gorgeous. "
"3380770","3381210"," It's healthy."
"3382570","3382830"," Right?"
"3383030","3383610"," We're above the monthly."
"3384050","3384730"," We're above the weekly. "
"3385250","3385930"," We're above the daily."
"3386690","3389310"," We're teeing off on the daily, right?"
"3389590","3393310"," And on intraday we're teeing off on the hourly on NVIDIA."
"3393790","3395510"," So does that mean that NVIDIA doesn't pull back here?"
"3395730","3395850"," No. "
"3396070","3396990"," NVIDIA can pull back here."
"3397490","3398110"," But I'll tell you what."
"3398110","3403910"," It would not shock me to see NVIDIA get bought down here in the daily. "
"3404610","3408550"," It would not shock me to see NVIDIA get bought down here, right?"
"3408710","3411110"," It's in continuation in NVIDIA, right?"
"3412070","3413310"," So that's my point on tech."
"3413590","3418250"," So I'm fascinated to see where the real money can be made."
"3419090","3424390"," I'm going to assume here too that a bunch of bulls were too scared to take this trade here. "
"3424390","3426910"," I'm going to bet in the real world."
"3427390","3430530"," Some of you guys may be like, yeah, no, I've been long NVIDIA since the bottom."
"3430750","3432470"," I bought it right down here and I've been long since. "
"3433030","3434630"," Matter of fact, I sold just right here."
"3434710","3440350"," Truth is, I'm going to promise that like 90% of bulls did not ride this entire thing up."
"3441110","3444870"," And they'll probably be scared of riding it up into Q2. "
"3445690","3453670"," So I'd be focused on this, watching this closely, watching stocks like NVIDIA, apple, any of the"
"3453670","3460870"," safe tech trades into Q2 for maybe some of the outstanding performance into Q2."
"3461230","3462470"," Maybe not the spot."
"3478330","3483630"," Anyone that's questioning this, I'm going to say likely has never been through. "
"3484570","3489930"," Maybe, maybe you bought the bottom of a COVID, but anyone that has been in the bottom."
"3491110","3495510"," Oh, wait, 19, 18, 19, 20, 20."
"3496210","3497170"," I don't know. "
"3498430","3499550"," All kinds of."
"3500710","3501610"," They have the."
"3505550","3508610"," Probably don't have any experience buying bottoms. "
"3508930","3509070"," So."
"3510810","3511790"," I've heard all those arguments."
"3512030","3517730"," I've heard these arguments in the past with these, the comic regarded tech bulls. "
"3519910","3521750"," But in fact, it just rips."
"3521910","3525510"," It just keeps going up and keeps going up and keeps going over performing."
"3525910","3528690"," You should, I want you to, if you're a bear out there, wait a look at when you see over"
"3528690","3530350"," performance in certain sectors. "
"3530750","3533570"," We're going to go deep dive yourself on sector performance."
"3535490","3536650"," And it's fascinating."
"3552140","3553560"," You know, I'll be honest with you too. "
"3553960","3556940"," So cob cobweb said it's hard out there for bulltards."
"3557380","3558180"," I got to say something."
"3558420","3560340"," I am not even enjoying the idea. "
"3560340","3561300"," I was this morning."
"3561580","3566740"," I was like, I don't want to become a, I don't want to become a tech bull again."
"3567040","3568700"," I'm like, I'm tired of becoming a tech bull. "
"3568880","3569980"," I'm like, I don't want to be that guy."
"3570320","3572220"," I'm like, I can't, I want to shoot myself."
"3572500","3577240"," I can't say that, but I want to take myself outside and whack myself in the head because once those"
"3577240","3578300"," people come out of the closet. "
"3580280","3582540"," They're more annoying than the Bitcoin bros."
"3583560","3586160"," Or as annoying as the Bitcoin bros."
"3586900","3587900"," If we go into that cycle. "
"3590960","3592040"," Because it does."
"3592200","3596060"," It just gets bought and it goes up and grinds higher and higher and higher and higher."
"3607750","3612230"," The Bank of England's man says financial conditions said into rate decisions. "
"3616620","3617940"," Take a look at the VIX real quick."
"3618220","3619680"," We'll go back to day trade in here."
"3619800","3622240"," Man says financial conditions fed into the rate decision. "
"3633220","3634340"," Take a look at the VIX real quick."
"3634500","3634840"," Hold on a minute."
"3640630","3642810"," We get a little bit of weakness here in the spy. "
"3648900","3651740"," Let's take a look at the spy on a multiple time frames there."
"3654420","3656100"," There's crossover right now in the spy."
"3658360","3660220"," Higher lows so far in the one minute. "
"3663740","3665840"," There's cross right now in the five minute though."
"3666620","3668900"," I'm just teeing off from above here."
"3678390","3682770"," There's crossover on the 15 minute. "
"3703750","3706610"," We'll tag some lines in here for you."
"3724930","3725270"," Just hang in here."
"3737140","3738820"," The S3 down here is another one. "
"3738960","3740320"," I'm not going to shell it but it's down there."
"3741500","3743940"," Maybe I guess we'll put it just slightly higher than it."
"3744520","3745700"," There's another one down here. "
"3756570","3758030"," Harley's looking pretty bearish, right?"
"3758150","3759310"," You see that bear cross right there?"
"3759990","3760950"," Let's look at the trend here."
"3761670","3762610"," I want you to see this here."
"3763230","3764410"," Here's your bearish cross right here. "
"3765370","3766570"," This is what's showing for you."
"3767330","3767890"," From the background."
"3768230","3769450"," I want you to see the bearish cross over. "
"3771270","3772110"," Right there."
"3775600","3776380"," So Harley trend."
"3777160","3778600"," The cross took place in the overnight. "
"3780400","3782080"," You can see it coming down right here."
"3783500","3786880"," I'm going to expect weakness and say end on them into Monday as well."
"3788160","3790180"," We have some targets down below. "
"3791720","3795980"," I'm going to give you some targets here in the low into Friday into Monday."
"3801900","3804520"," Harley's telling you that we're bearish here."
"3805160","3807080"," Let's see if I can get some of these down here. "
"3809300","3809660"," That one."
"3813070","3813970"," That one."
"3815530","3822520"," You already tagged this one right here. "
"3822660","3823460"," Kinda sorta."
"3823700","3824000"," Kinda."
"3842820","3843780"," PT one. "
"3844180","3845340"," It's good to take a couple of days."
"3846140","3846340"," Oh yeah."
"3851470","3853050"," PT one right down here. "
"3855310","3856190"," There's this one."
"3878310","3886260"," You can see it right there."
"3887760","3888960"," Let me show you this right still. "
"3890660","3905090"," You can"
"3905090","3906270"," get some exact targets down below."
"3913800","3914760"," PT two."
"3924830","3925530"," Just a second. "
"3925590","3926170"," I'm going to check all these."
"3926350","3928030"," Make sure I got them almost to the T here."
"3959860","3960780"," PT three. "
"3961920","3963060"," Right there in the spot."
"3967570","3968950"," Some other stuff down here."
"3969170","3974050"," There's PT four PT five at a three eighty three seventy three three five twenty six. "
"3978960","3980540"," Three eighty one oh seven."
"3981400","3982780"," That's that's three right here."
"3984560","3986100"," Three eighty oh five. "
"3986560","3987380"," There's a downside."
"3988580","3990460"," PT three four PT four."
"3996910","3999290"," This probably will extend into Monday though. "
"4000190","4003170"," PT four likely Monday not guaranteed today."
"4005450","4007470"," I'll leave these towards the end of the day over here."
"4012120","4013500"," PT five though. "
"4013720","4017040"," If we can get this it'd be nice because if we can get the VIX up here, it'd be a"
"4017040","4020720"," nice dip to buy into end of month and."
"4023340","4024220"," PT six."
"4031360","4033960"," Right there six five four three. "
"4034820","4034860"," Oh."
"4037280","4038260"," Fun summer here."
"4038520","4039340"," I fucked it up but whatever. "
"4039600","4040000"," It's close enough."
"4040060","4048170"," It's close enough."
"4049230","4051530"," If you're looking for a place to tee off in the market. "
"4081600","4083000"," Back to a five minute chart."
"4084100","4084980"," Right in here."
"4089340","4090860"," This is where the sellers are. "
"4091900","4092920"," The swellers are up here."
"4093580","4094040"," This red box."
"4095279","4097899"," And the weak sellers are right here. "
"4100140","4101180"," Call these weak sellers."
"4126770","4128090"," These are the swellers baby."
"4128390","4129710"," These are the strong swellers up here. "
"4129930","4131310"," And there's a gap to close above here."
"4132029","4134990"," Wouldn't be shocked to see this get closed before we started heading our way down."
"4135109","4136970"," It was a nice nice nice little gap right here. "
"4137750","4140050"," We call these guys the Jim bros."
"4141710","4144770"," These are the dudes who don't work out their legs."
"4146630","4149090"," They haven't learned to do full body exercises yet. "
"4150550","4153310"," They're just like they're just like short everything."
"4153970","4155130"," Short to the depths of hell."
"4162020","4163120"," Swellers are up here. "
"4163960","4167850"," If you want to get bullish here."
"4168810","4171470"," If you want to get bullish you need to see lots of work."
"4171630","4173689"," I'm going to show you where the trap is here right now. "
"4173850","4175010"," I'm going to show you where the trap is here."
"4178649","4180930"," So you see something like this go up."
"4184450","4186130"," You see something like that come down. "
"4187750","4188689"," You'll see price."
"4191710","4192490"," Trade up here."
"4194070","4195530"," You'll get a rip confirmation. "
"4195530","4197190"," You'll be like yeah I'm all set here."
"4197230","4198470"," I'm going to take a long and then boom."
"4198810","4199950"," There it goes right down there. "
"4200530","4204190"," So anything like this is a trap for bulls."
"4204870","4211350"," You can't even take along here without not only this here but a blast up higher."
"4212170","4213570"," And recapture at least the hourly. "
"4214170","4216930"," So something over three nine three ninety four twenty seven."
"4217470","4218510"," Something like that."
"4218770","4221310"," You'd be safe for a trade to three ninety six. "
"4221670","4226810"," And even then all this you've got all this volatility up here to get above the daily trigger for a"
"4226810","4228810"," safety trade above three ninety six and change."
"4229990","4235950"," So this is all set up right now for trapping a bull into the clothes today for today and Friday."
"4244510","4245530"," And right up here. "
"4246070","4249910"," I'm almost going to guarantee or not guarantee but I would guarantee if we even get up there."
"4250510","4253410"," You'll be thinking that we're going to close this gap and be all bullish."
"4253590","4255110"," They're just going to roll the shit right down on you. "
"4257290","4260070"," So we'll set this up where we got this set up for the rest of the day."
"4260070","4264110"," I'm going to read some of the chat here and see what you guys think about what I've had to"
"4264110","4264690"," talk about today."
"4264750","4270210"," It's kind of kind of a sloppy presentation because it's up the cuff but it's something for you to"
"4270210","4271070"," look at over the weekend. "
"4271350","4271590"," Right as well."
"4271730","4272610"," Leave you to the weekend."
"4273030","4273970"," I want you to think about this. "
"4274230","4279850"," The global crisis stemming from recent stress is low and sees a 80% chance of the financial stress"
"4279850","4284230"," abates and discussion shifts back to inflation and the lower probability of that will come in a"
"4284230","4284570"," recession."
"4284570","4288190"," If it's but also if the economy looked weak, if that will react."
"4288750","4294070"," If it's but also is the point of developing macro prudential tools was to address problems that's"
"4294070","4297090"," that through specific responses, not monetary policy. "
"4297330","4298830"," That's but also is most recent."
"4299250","4302690"," It will have to ratchet up more as financial stress of base."
"4303170","4304270"," The economy remains strong. "
"4304710","4309050"," So also they're teeing off down here at 391 flat."
"4309050","4314350"," So bears, if you're looking for a if you're looking for a quick, fast reversal, it could come"
"4314350","4315990"," really fast right here and you get PT one."
"4320320","4321860"," I'm going to want you to think about this over the weekend. "
"4321860","4325540"," I want you to if you're going to be put in size in this market now for the next quarter."
"4326040","4328940"," I want to be thinking about a few things."
"4328940","4330760"," I want you to be thinking about it to the Senate quarter. "
"4330920","4331940"," Just chew on over the weekend."
"4332180","4336880"," Think about where the where the market will likely wind up into end of month."
"4337640","4344160"," The fact that there will probably be opportunities into end of month to place a trade. "
"4345520","4349560"," They'll probably be weak parts to the market on that date specifically."
"4350400","4354020"," So if you want to take a log in the market, you might get a nice week, week moments."
"4354800","4355940"," I want you to think about over the weekend. "
"4356700","4362820"," What's the most probably but probable most bullish part to the market for Q two."
"4363280","4372020"," I want you to think about also not quite putting risk on in size without some kind of a cheap"
"4372020","4374660"," hedge for Q two."
"4375020","4377980"," And it doesn't have to be on tech like I'm in a short fucking Nvidia. "
"4378100","4384880"," I might be like, yeah, maybe I'll be looking for a bottom of the spy as a market hedge."
"4385640","4386540"," Or maybe it is."
"4386660","4389980"," Maybe you are riding up an NQ and shortened NQ along the way. "
"4392060","4398300"," But I've seen divergences and past bottoms where spy is like NQ's just keep going and spy is like"
"4398300","4402800"," having having like problems catching up."
"4408500","4411660"," Let's read the I'm going to read the comments here and see you guys are talking about the comments."
"4412180","4416110"," See you guys are saying here. "
"4417370","4421090"," Emerson, I didn't see your I didn't see your comments."
"4421090","4424370"," If you're in here, if you're in here, if you're in the tolls in here."
"4425310","4428650"," If Hagerty's listening to you guys in there, your private discord that you got out there. "
"4428730","4429550"," If you need you guys are listening."
"4430930","4431970"," I didn't see your car."
"4432070","4435130"," I saw your names, but I didn't see your comments in the first video from this morning. "
"4435130","4437590"," But I just want to say thanks to all of you guys for being a friend over the years."
"4450820","4451440"," Swellers, baby."
"4459320","4463900"," Yeah, another thing too about banks would be this doesn't always happen. "
"4464980","4465900"," I didn't mention this."
"4466660","4471940"," Whenever I see selling into an ER, because this was brought up to me as well."
"4472080","4475100"," Whenever I see selling into an ER, Tesla's a famous one, right?"
"4475760","4478460"," They either buy into the ER and then dump it. "
"4479700","4483140"," Or they sell directly into an ER and then they buy it."
"4485080","4488520"," So if you're seeing banks and we talk about banks here oftentimes, right?"
"4488620","4495880"," I'm like, hey, man, they're buying into where we're at low."
"4496380","4501560"," And they're like, pay attention to them buying into your season or selling into your season. "
"4501620","4506340"," You can actually, before you get there, see if they're selling into an ER season or buying into an"
"4506340","4506840"," ER season."
"4508560","4511860"," That tends to remain into your seasons."
"4512120","4513300"," That's how you get to sell the news. "
"4515120","4515800"," Mantra, right?"
"4516040","4518980"," You get to sell the news if it's going up or sell the news if it's going down."
"4520180","4525980"," And the scary part about selling into an ER is sometimes when you're selling into an ER, you get"
"4525980","4531160"," that last capitulation into that ER, even if the news is good."
"4531480","4535000"," And then after the options market is gone, then it takes off. "
"4539090","4540190"," What are you guys saying here?"
"4540810","4544690"," Tommy Thornton told me in an email that Paul Tudor Jones recommends Short Tech as well."
"4545690","4546810"," Basically, the movie was crowded and overdone."
"4547110","4548710"," I don't agree with that statement at all. "
"4550790","4552890"," The very least better to target oversold sectors."
"4554110","4559570"," Historically, I'm going to warn any of you reading these comments right now in chat to not"
"4559570","4563270"," historically at least do not follow that advice."
"4564210","4565770"," Do not follow that advice. "
"4565890","4572410"," Historically, you do not chase beating down sectors, sectors these next three months."
"4573170","4574450"," They will flounder."
"4575750","4577370"," They will not overperform. "
"4579210","4581970"," You can check that on StockTarts.com."
"4581970","4584170"," You can look at the historical evidence of this."
"4584550","4589370"," Now, it may be one off where they do overperform, but historically, they do not."
"4591030","4593650"," The probability is not on your side on that trade. "
"4601060","4602580"," You chase overbought sectors."
"4602960","4606300"," As a matter of fact, you chase the fuck out of these overbought sectors."
"4607200","4608800"," That is historically what you do. "
"4609340","4613460"," And you watch sectors that are up and coming soon."
"4614220","4620680"," As I showed you on StockTarts.com, you watch, I believe, XLI and some other sectors for when they"
"4620680","4622840"," have hit their bottom or their rate to take off."
"4624920","4632200"," At least historically, that has proven itself time and time and time and time again. "
"4640890","4644710"," Inevitably, probability-wise, everything says to chase that stuff."
"4644710","4649790"," So you guys are staying here."
"4650270","4651950"," Tesla new low, 188. "
"4652390","4653850"," Nick has the same blood."
"4656330","4657190"," Young Jim Bros."
"4657510","4659090"," That's all you got to change the name, don't I?"
"4659830","4662590"," I forgot that we changed the actual name of Jim Bros. "
"4662950","4665710"," I forgot Young too."
"4666070","4666650"," You're right."
"4666890","4667950"," Hold on a second here. "
"4670010","4671350"," My bad, my bad."
"4672050","4674170"," We got to get that into the lexicon, don't we?"
"4674450","4675130"," Young Jim Bros."
"4681410","4682770"," More than Dan Breslin, how are you?"
"4684890","4685930"," Oh, let me see here. "
"4687710","4688490"," Thanks, Binky."
"4689470","4691010"," Yeah, you guys can do this on your own."
"4691110","4692270"," You don't need me. "
"4692610","4693610"," And I'm going to tell you something."
"4693870","4695010"," I'm not a financial advisor."
"4695790","4699010"," So don't be taken when I say as financial advice. "
"4699350","4704670"," I want you on your own to do your own due diligence, read up on this stuff, and more than"
"4704670","4708350"," likely consult someone in finance, a financial advisor."
"4708690","4712510"," It doesn't matter of fact, when you do consult that financial advisor, I want you to show them this"
"4712510","4718510"," stuff and say, hey, look, historically, I should be chasing tech here."
"4718630","4719490"," Is that true or not?"
"4720710","4723790"," Because you want to get their answer and find out if they know what they're talking about. "
"4724050","4727310"," You know, financial advisors, it's funny too."
"4727390","4733490"," You don't have to actually be a financial advisor in some states to give financial advice, which is"
"4733490","4733770"," crazy."
"4734930","4738070"," You know, people have their own. "
"4738370","4740110"," They want to get fees from you too, right?"
"4741090","4749130"," But my point here is you should take what I say to you, educate yourself over the weekend, and then"
"4749130","4754310"," go get your financial advisor and ask them these questions for her and see what they have to say."
"4756590","4763190"," You know, you get like some guy on, not chase or anything, but you get people who did chase quote"
"4763190","4763490"," here."
"4765010","4767390"," Because I love chase dropping intel for us. "
"4768130","4770010"," So chase saying Tommy Thornton, right?"
"4770530","4772230"," And Paul Tudor Jones."
"4773930","4777370"," You know, if you're going to short tech, I can see that trade."
"4777530","4781990"," I can see the trade of short tech on the highs, but I wouldn't be short and tech looking for"
"4781990","4784290"," like a blast down to the depths of hell. "
"4784850","4786530"," Is my point, I guess, that I'm trying to make."
"4786690","4787570"," Maybe I'm not being clear."
"4788370","4789570"," I'd be long tech. "
"4789790","4793470"," I'd be I'd be like supportive dip buying on tech personally."
"4795370","4801210"," Supportive dip buying and I'd be really risk or it'd be really like eyeball and S&P 500 is sketchy."
"4808870","4809770"," Hey, good morning. "
"4809970","4810730"," Casey LAS."
"4810730","4811270"," How are you?"
"4811530","4812850"," Casey LAS seven."
"4813490","4814110"," Good morning. "
"4816720","4818120"," Welcome to the to the show."
"4823340","4824060"," Yeah, I'd be."
"4824160","4828380"," I definitely because it scares me all the time is you've got people out there. "
"4828380","4833220"," They're not not like chasing me, but you got people like they come on Fintuit or they go on to"
"4833220","4836540"," CNBC and they have to sell books, right?"
"4836740","4839840"," Like I got to sell a book and I got to sell a program and I got to sell a"
"4839840","4840260"," service."
"4841040","4845440"," And so I'm going to tell people, yeah, short tech to the depths of how tech's going to crash."
"4847980","4852720"," So you don't have to be careful as to what people are trying to sell you out there. "
"4853200","4854320"," What's what's their motivation?"
"4855420","4861160"," Like a financial advisor's motivation is not going to be the same as Peter Schiff."
"4861480","4863420"," Peter Schiff is not your financial advisor."
"4864040","4865440"," Peter Schiff is trying to sell books. "
"4867560","4868520"," Does that make sense?"
"4873170","4874890"," Take that into consideration."
"4898280","4899940"," Yeah, you should see continuation of this."
"4900120","4905060"," You should see continuation as my expectation here is that spy is like. "
"4905060","4910400"," If we were looking at a one year, like this rest of this year chart, expectation is here is that"
"4910400","4916920"," spy like trades like this, and you're going to get like a peak, like 430, 440, 460."
"4917580","4923840"," You're going to get some lows, you know, 380, 360, and then maybe that last little crut that you"
"4923840","4927620"," like when you're in the trough and you get that last little, the last little dip down below."
"4928300","4930200"," You're 2800, 3200, something like that. "
"4931180","4932960"," You're in the trough and you get the last capitulation."
"4932960","4937320"," But meanwhile, you're going to see some other sectors outperform while that's happening."
"4937640","4940280"," And we're extending this trough and spy right now. "
"4940580","4941800"," That's the whole j-pow thing."
"4941900","4944800"," It's like everything was all lined up, right?"
"4945000","4946180"," Even though it didn't sound right."
"4947100","4948960"," I think we all knew that timing was wrong. "
"4949100","4950040"," We talked about that in the stream."
"4950240","4951360"," We were like, man, the time is wrong."
"4952100","4955160"," We're like, I don't see this should happen for a few more years. "
"4955460","4956540"," Remember we talked about Mary, right?"
"4956700","4957320"," They're landscaper."
"4958380","4959880"," Like, man, Mary's not all fucked up yet."
"4960920","4962060"," Mary's going to take some time. "
"4962100","4962720"," She's got a new truck."
"4962780","4964740"," She's got a new pay down alarm mortgage."
"4965600","4968200"," She's got a new trailer, new lawnmowers. "
"4969100","4970060"," What does she care?"
"4970680","4975060"," She's got demand for a lawn speed mode."
"4976260","4980160"," It's not like Mary's coming into the end of a real true cycle."
"4980920","4983000"," It's been that COVID's been like a crunch cycle. "
"4984060","4989600"," So Mary hasn't had like a decade of polluting herself."
"4989600","4992060"," And polluting her credit and polluting her overspending."
"4992460","4994680"," She probably went out and bought the new truck. "
"4995020","4996120"," Paid that her mortgage."
"4997140","4999340"," You know, bought some lawnmowers brand new."
"4999920","5005420"," I think a poster when these guys said that her bullet maybe said it. "
"5005820","5008400"," Like, you know, it's all fun."
"5008500","5010120"," The whole thing is fucked up right now."
"5010240","5015000"," So we're applying tools when we're expecting Mary to kind of like be at the end of the life of"
"5015000","5016720"," the truck and her lawnmowers and life. "
"5017100","5021380"," And instead of reinvesting in her lawn care company, she was partying in Las Vegas."
"5022900","5025600"," She broke her leg and didn't recover from it."
"5025840","5026700"," Like all these kinds of things. "
"5027940","5029400"," And so we're not quite in that."
"5029600","5030840"," We're on the right part of the cycle."
"5031320","5031960"," I think that's what J."
"5032100","5032460"," Paul sees. "
"5033480","5034540"," I think he's like shit."
"5035220","5036860"," He's like timing's not right."
"5039420","5050040"," Yeah, I'm"
"5050040","5053740"," not I'm not saying that you buy I'm not saying that you buy a video today. "
"5053760","5056880"," I'm saying I'd be looking for buys to be looking for dips to buy."
"5057100","5058980"," I want you guys to realize the difference."

"5064360","5068960"," Or even a sector when you're when you're supportive sector, you're looking for dips to buy. "
"5069780","5073140"," When you're an unsupportive sector, you're looking for rips to sell."
"5073140","5078260"," This is a key point that gets lost in the conversation."
"5079440","5079920"," Right. "
"5080060","5080640"," There's a conversation."

"5227620","5238360"," Look at the GME squeezing higher to currently $22.75. It"
"5238360","5239620"," is at a point of resistance. "
"5240360","5241480"," It is worth watching though."
"5241880","5247140"," It just came off of a one, two, three beautiful trigger right here."

"5291640","5292900"," You just get the squeeze higher. "
"5293860","5301020"," And then you'd want to see the hourly, the minute and the five minute come up and extend this trade"

"5302600","5308800"," You could see like a brief push higher here, but you want to see this confirmation for higher"
"5308800","5309160"," highs."
"5309160","5316820"," So if you're not in GME, you'd want to see a retest of $22 "
"5316820","5323840",".80 successful retest before you get involved in a long hair or a pullback. "
"5324680","5328160"," And check a retest on a low here."

"5425190","5425910"," Definitely developing. "
"5426270","5427470"," One, two, three trigger."
"5429250","5431010"," Might get a squeeze on BBBY."
"5433010","5433970"," Oh, look at that dude. "
"5434130","5435370"," That thing squeezes big time."
"5436830","5440090"," If this, whatever the hell this squeezes, it's going to be a monster ripper."
"5440410","5441090"," It's going to be a phaser. "
"5442050","5442610"," Look at that."
"5444410","5444770"," 137."
"5449190","5450550"," I don't think you get up here though. "
"5450630","5452110"," I don't think you get up to three or four bucks."
"5452110","5457410"," But whenever this thing is done and it starts ripping face, it's going to be, it's going to be"
"5457410","5457910"," explosive."
"5458630","5460830"," I wonder if this happens into end of quarter. "
"5461630","5463190"," I wonder if this starts squeezing here."
"5464370","5464990"," End of quarter."
"5466570","5468610"," Now, the play would be dead below. "
"5474180","5477740"," 81.8195. That is looking juicy, man."
"5478880","5479600"," This is good."
"5479740","5485080"," I bet you the BBY folks are foaming at the mouth right now. "
"5486940","5488540"," To say the least."
"5490300","5492960"," M.C. It's looking better."
"5493180","5494220"," M.C. is looking like it. "
"5494740","5496480"," You might want to monitor M.C. too."
"5499140","5505960"," To be interested if it can hold a retest of a, it has to retest and start making its way"
"5505960","5506280"," higher."
"5506560","5510320"," You need to see retest higher. "
"5510900","5512420"," If it breaks below here, man."
"5516780","5518280"," BBY looks the sexiest to me."

"5535020","5536240"," Let me look at BBY in the background."
"5537940","5540760"," GME is looking face ripperish too, isn't it?"
"5542860","5544360"," We'll look at a gas next."
"5545040","5547500"," Yeah, BBY looks like it wants to rip some faces off. "
"5550100","5550660"," GME."
"5551800","5552360"," BBY."

"5570460","5570900"," Look at it."
"5571160","5572220"," BBY has gotten murdered. "
"5574500","5580580"," If BBY can never get above 0.9295 and like hold it."
"5581440","5584580"," Oh, I bet those bulls want the revenge on BBY."
"5585960","5588000"," How's a gas doing?"
"5588460","5589540"," How's a natty gas doing?"

"5616760","5619480"," You got a gap on high to close to it."
"5619480","5622740"," You got a gap close at 774 on UNG. "

"6486940","6487880"," Just heads up out there. "
"6488800","6493380"," If BBY holds price where it is right now in the one and five minute come up too."

"6512620","6515640"," You can see this is the last line of defense on the hourly for the bears."
"6515640","6518200"," Bears have to step in here. "
"6518280","6522240"," If they can't step in, we're going to start squeezing here on the spy as well."
"6523020","6525280"," So young Jim bros got taken out, right?"
"6526560","6528640"," Last defense here for sellers."

"6675060","6677240"," Or he read that comment and he didn't know what it meant."
"6681560","6682740"," Let's look at the Spyro quick. "
"6682920","6683720"," Let's get ES2."
"6683820","6685520"," I know we got futures traders out there."
"6685640","6686260"," Let's take a look here. "
"6687620","6689720"," All this coolishness right now in the market."

"6709640","6710200"," Let me know."
"6710340","6711120"," There might be a trade here."
"6711260","6714600"," There might be like, if we can break through, if book map shows, we're going to smash through it,"
"6714720","6715940"," maybe smash this one right here. "
"6716500","6716960"," That's possible."
"6717540","6718780"," Let's take a look and see what's going on."
"6718980","6720900"," What's going on the background on the Spyro?"
"6723470","6725370"," And then right here, you can see it, right?"
"6727010","6733250"," You get the Spy trying to smash above here to the hourly trigger at 39398. "
"6734010","6739970"," And then above, you've got 395.95. 55, my bad."
"6742550","6746270"," 395.55. This is the weekly trigger here at my cursor is."
"6746870","6756530"," And you have the daily trigger, 395.04. Dude, bulls want to get above this, man. "
"6756970","6758850"," Bulls want to like, end this quarter."
"6759870","6761770"," End this quarter at 4060."
"6762690","6763770"," Let's look at SPX and ES. "
"6765510","6766790"," And see what that is."
"6767050","6767930"," Oh, yeah, man."
"6771250","6772050"," GPM caller. "
"6775070","6775870"," Oh, bulls."
"6776810","6782790"," If you want the bull thesis, you guys even see this on your end."
"6782890","6784470"," Let me let me bring this a little bit closer. "
"6784710","6785190"," I don't know."
"6785450","6786770"," You're like, make this a little bit closer."
"6786970","6787830"," Yeah, let's go a little bit closer. "
"6788490","6792990"," I mean, that ain't blind, but 4060."
"6793810","6794190"," Where's that?"
"6804750","6806190"," Oh, it's not here, is it?"
"6806190","6807790"," It's way up here."
"6809310","6810970"," Ooh, right. "
"6811210","6812350"," Dude, look at that."
"6814230","6819030"," Bull thesis for the end of quarter."
"6823800","6826640"," Bull thesis for the end of quarter. "
"6828660","6830780"," Bulls like cap."
"6831040","6832780"," Show me the 31st, baby."
"6835500","6837180"," Let's go on a 15 minute chart here. "
"6840450","6842790"," Bull's like, bull's like cap."
"6842950","6843310"," We got a week."
"6848620","6849960"," We get time cap. "
"6853310","6854350"," Bull thesis."
"6858050","6859610"," Get back over there."
"6861530","6864010"," They're like, but cap, we got time, baby. "
"6864270","6866950"," They're like bull thesis."
"6867850","6869370"," That's the actual target captain."
"6870510","6873070"," Like Jim, you don't know what you're talking about, bro. "
"6873690","6875810"," This is, this was the low cap."
"6878420","6879720"," This is where we're going, baby."
"6880060","6883360"," Boom, boom, and boom, and they're going to print those. "
"6883560","6884520"," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"6886120","6888560"," The bull, whoa, whoa."
"6890800","6892340"," We're going to do cap right here. "
"6893080","6897270"," I don't know what's going on here."
"6897770","6898030"," Okay."
"6898670","6899950"," That's pretty bad. "
"6902390","6904170"," It's pretty bad right there."
"6904990","6906030"," It's pretty bad."
"6908210","6910110"," I don't care what you say cap. "
"6912740","6914040"," We're tagging it, baby."
"6914800","6917000"," We're magnet in the 4060."
"6918000","6919380"," We're smashing in fashion. "
"6920980","6927380"," Cap, not only that, when the next JPM collar comes out, they're going to have the high price at 430"
"6927380","6931100"," or 440, and they're going to have the low price of like 370, baby."
"6931580","6934140"," The bulls are saying is the bull thesis right here."
"6935460","6937700"," Brushin' off the sellers coming into the market here. "
"6937820","6939300"," They're like, yeah, we're not doing this cap."
"6939500","6940140"," We're not doing this."
"6942080","6947680"," You got bears out there and fin to it saying, how many days left until the 31st to get that"
"6947680","6950000"," magnet at 3,600?"
"6951500","6953640"," So last night I went through fin to it. "
"6955800","6959900"," See, here's your targets for SPX anyways."
"6959900","6965420"," I went through fin to it last night, and I'm like, I'm going to look up the JPM collar, and"
"6965420","6973620"," then I'm going to look at it like a week ago, and then 14 days ago, and then like five"
"6973620","6975060"," days ago, and then like a day ago."
"6975560","6981100"," And I see all these posts and people are like, well, we got 14 days left to hit 3,600,"
"6981660","6982360"," plenty of time. "
"6983080","6984260"," Then we hit like nine days."
"6984600","6986200"," People are like, oh, we got like nine days left."
"6986500","6988960"," There's still plenty of time to get down to 3,600. "
"6988960","6991000"," And then, of course, I'm reading the most recent ones."
"6992140","6996140"," And they're like, we got five more sessions left."
"6996300","6997200"," We can get it done. "
"6997620","6998480"," Six more sessions left."
"6998600","6999180"," We can get it done."
"7000600","7002200"," But time's burning, baby. "
"7007460","7008120"," Time's burning."
"7008260","7008880"," Watch these sellers."
"7009100","7010880"," The other trying to tee off on SPX right here. "
"7011020","7011340"," They're trying."
"7011380","7015560"," These hourly sellers are coming into play right now, trying to push down on spy."
"7023570","7027070"," Always trying to track that sentiment on JPM caller. "
"7027730","7030390"," You've got ES tagging the hourly."
"7031270","7035430"," If you have a bullish thesis on ES, that's that's ever source."
"7035870","7036870"," Fucking ever source. "
"7037790","7040710"," Must be like the second most looked up stock on trading view."
"7043670","7048030"," Yeah, or ES now trading into the hourly to the pin strike right now."
"7048030","7051830"," Pin strike on ES 397650. "
"7053530","7058990"," For the bullish thesis to continue, you want to see the one, the five, the weekly push above and"
"7058990","7065230"," trade to three nine eight five seven five, and then above here to three nine nine point or three"
"7065230","7069570"," nine nine point zero point seven three nine nine zero point seven five."
"7071630","7076370"," We want to see some kind of some kind of like the one minute, the five minute just coming up"
"7076370","7082190"," and giving some support to this week or this week this monthly season up weekly monthly push higher"
"7082190","7084630"," to try to get price up here and squeeze up."
"7085530","7088630"," Let's call it 3984 flat on ES. "
"7091540","7093380"," Just squeezing up there."
"7099900","7103160"," A dip by an ES 3962 75."
"7105940","7107140"," 3962 75. "
"7111520","7113000"," Swellers trying to step in."
"7113100","7114720"," This is where the real sellers are, right?"
"7115220","7116660"," We know where the fake sellers are."
"7116800","7118160"," We know where the real sellers are. "
"7118240","7120460"," You can see that big old red wick right here."
"7120920","7122920"," They were like, they were like, no, bro, we're right here."
"7123740","7125800"," We did like leg exercises, bro. "
"7125880","7126760"," You ain't getting up there."
"7131840","7133200"," We're getting getting up there, dog."
"7133420","7134040"," We ain't doing it today. "
"7134340","7135160"," It's Friday, man."
"7135240","7135840"," We didn't go on vacation."
"7136320","7137100"," We worked our legs on. "
"7137180","7140100"," We worked legs on Fridays telling you no, man."
"7140100","7141640"," We didn't take, we don't take Fridays off."
"7141940","7142700"," What are you crazy?"
"7148260","7150440"," Young Jim bros, they take Fridays off. "
"7151960","7152880"," We hit the gym."
"7152940","7154580"," We hit the gym every single Friday, bro."
"7154700","7155780"," We'll do legs every Friday. "
"7166620","7167420"," Five minute chart."
"7167640","7168140"," Let's go to the one minute."
"7171620","7173620"," And not too, not too crazy here. "
"7173620","7174180"," 1208."
"7176680","7178540"," Right at 12.03, we got a new high."
"7180760","7186860"," So they got their new high at a new high for the bulls was at 12.03. So they don't"
"7186860","7189500"," actually have to get anything until 1215. "
"7190320","7194020"," They can start another, another, another attempt for a new high up here."
"7198530","7199650"," We'll just stay in the one minute."
"7199790","7200550"," You guys like trading it. "
"7200750","7213960"," So we have"
"7223470","7226690"," a retest of the one minute right now."
"7226690","7227710"," On the one minute, we have a new high."
"7228610","7230450"," Come back down and retest the one minute. "
"7230670","7234890"," This will be the second test down below at 39162."
"7236230","7241970"," Bulls will need to get a reaction or either hold the one minute or get a reaction in price on"
"7241970","7244590"," the five minute right down here."
"7245430","7248810"," And they'll need to get a new high and close this gap above here. "
"7253600","7254960"," You can see the gap above."
"7254960","7257080"," It's all shaded in this gray area."
"7259520","7262720"," If you're looking for a death by, it's down below at 39162. "
"7264020","7268140"," Or if price can regain the white and yellow line on the one minute chart."
"7281460","7284120"," This isn't the, so I want you to see this."
"7284440","7291790"," Someone said, can you update the daily triggers right here?"
"7292090","7292590"," You see it?"
"7293210","7294710"," And this is the hourly below it. "
"7295530","7298230"," So these two, I should change these boxes here."
"7298450","7299070"," Wrong color."
"7299850","7300750"," Just make this white. "
"7301290","7302390"," We'll make this white too."
"7306070","7308430"," They are in their correct places right now."
"7309210","7310810"," Someone asked me to update the colors. "
"7310990","7311550"," You can see it."
"7311730","7313370"," Here's the hourly trigger right here."
"7315010","7315870"," It says it. "
"7315990","7317050"," I should show this to the side."
"7317190","7317990"," But here's your hourly trigger."
"7318490","7318850"," Here's your pivot. "
"7319170","7319370"," Hold on."
"7321770","7322710"," There's your hourly trigger."
"7322710","7324810"," Here's your daily trigger above here. "
"7326750","7331210"," I should probably just be using white boxes for where the sellers are."
"7334700","7336180"," I'm using yellow and red."
"7336520","7337860"," Like weak sellers is yellow. "
"7339240","7340340"," Big sellers are red."
"7340740","7345580"," But in truth, they should probably just be white at this point because it's mixing up the color"
"7345580","7348260"," scheme, isn't it?"
"7348740","7349540"," I agree with you on this."
"7355920","7356700"," Fair point. "
"7364770","7367350"," Every day is like day with a bad hip."
"7369770","7372150"," Big sweller sellers coming in above."
"7372470","7373530"," They're just like roar. "
"7390460","7392300"," Yes, still pretty bullish here."
"7393100","7395740"," Yes, yes is squeezing right now."
"7398460","7400220"," Even though spy is selling off. "
"7401400","7403040"," This is a very good."
"7403040","7405160"," This is a very good lesson for you out there."
"7405280","7408560"," If you're trading ES right now, or if you're not, I guess if you're a cash market trader. "
"7411520","7418620"," You can actually see the active hedging in spy versus ES."
"7422080","7425380"," Cheap puts for hedge funds in ES and in spy."
"7437150","7438290"," What are you asking for?"
"7438650","7447630"," V.O.R.B. UNG just got smacked down like it was nothing along with spy. "
"7448870","7450410"," Let's look at BBY."
"7450490","7451230"," Did they get smacked down?"
"7451390","7454470"," BBY is still the strongest out of them still holding up right now."
"7455350","7458930"," BBY didn't get smacked down like UNG did with spy. "
"7461730","7462950"," Let's look at that GME."
"7463050","7464070"," Did it get smacked down or no?"
"7466250","7472470"," Yeah, so GME got the smacked out above at 23.36, retesting the previous high."
"7473530","7478910"," Of all of the tickers, it looks like BBY is the strongest most currently. "
"7481130","7486830"," HYG into Friday showing you still weakness here in HYG."
"7487950","7494880"," Diverging from price on spy currently showing you risk off."
"7497820","7499820"," Nvidia smacked right down. "
"7501060","7502240"," You got bears."
"7502520","7504600"," Bears just piling in the tech right now."
"7504780","7506140"," Bears like boom. "
"7507000","7507100"," No."
"7509340","7510020"," Boom."
"7512360","7515400"," Bears like I'll ride these things into the depths of hell. "
"7515400","7516720"," I don't care if they go to zero."
"7516720","7517520"," I'm short in tech."
"7520720","7521960"," Nvidia is zero. "
"7527840","7534060"," So we're going to go back to a five minute chart here and just take a peek."
"7534660","7537060"," Let's take a look at a five minute chart on Nvidia."
"7537880","7538820"," Still not done here. "
"7539060","7540080"," Trade's not dead for the bulls."
"7542040","7543160"," Still not dead here."
"7544120","7547760"," I'm going to show you two different ways for this for this trade to work itself out. "
"7547820","7552320"," Like I showed you earlier on the five minute at least there's two ways for this trade to work"
"7552320","7552620"," itself."
"7552620","7555540"," I'm going to show you both ways you've got."
"7564780","7566620"," Man, we're building these right now too. "
"7568340","7570320"," You'll see either a bull trap."
"7572520","7574320"," And that's where we get the confirmation."
"7574960","7575520"," Dammit. "
"7582630","7583190"," Dammit."
"7583650","7583930"," Dammit."
"7584310","7584830"," Dammit. "
"7585070","7588910"," You get the confirmation on price here and this is actually where you get the roll."
"7589670","7591590"," It's where you get the bloodbath over here."
"7592230","7594550"," The second thing you'd be looking for here. "
"7596230","7597370"," That's just clear it all."
"7602320","7603260"," Option two here."
"7603540","7603660"," Hold on. "
"7603660","7619480"," And this is"
"7619480","7619980"," the bad one."
"7620120","7621040"," This is the one where things get ugly."
"7621960","7626140"," This is where price just immediately reverses and goes down. "
"7626480","7627520"," You just get a roll here."
"7629520","7630600"," Comes back up here."
"7630780","7632540"," Gets the rejection and starts heading lower. "
"7633240","7633940"," That's option two."
"7634840","7638440"," And then after that, that's the ugly one man."
"7638560","7640880"," That's the one where we just start blasting down on the depths of hell. "
"7641860","7643140"," That one's gross and disgusting."
"7644700","7646500"," Almost a pin strike on the early above."
"7647380","7653820"," The bullish case here is that we've weakened the swellers up here. "
"7654740","7656700"," And that would be where we come back down here."
"7656920","7662160"," We test and we start blasting through these sellers and start moving up into the weekly above here"
"7662160","7662520"," to the close."
"7667730","7669950"," Just looking at tech here. "
"7671230","7674410"," I'm not going to give this to the bulls in the close so far."
"7675270","7676970"," Or at least this like big giant squeeze."
"7677230","7677950"," I'm not seeing it maybe. "
"7678670","7681050"," But seeing tech as weak as it is right now."
"7682310","7683790"," It's kind of limping along right now."
"7686030","7688470"," So we kind of need tech to help us buy out. "
"7731090","7733170"," See you guys are saying inside the stream chat."
"7748460","7749440"," You're doing here."
"7751580","7752800"," See what I got going on here. "

"8758380","8759380"," have a zero date. "
"8762340","8765920"," And Fridays are typically zero dates for those stocks."
"8766500","8769280"," So like UNG, today is a zero date for UNG."
"8770240","8776420"," So like you get zero dates every day on a spy, but you don't get them on some tickers. "
"8777040","8782800"," So where you'll see like a ticker underperformed during the week, once we come into, sometimes it's"
"8782800","8791520"," end of quarter, end of month, end of week, you'll see those tickers explode, either on the up or"
"8791520","8792100"," down side."
"8792840","8797940"," So let's say a ticker's been going, let's see if I have single date opaxes."

"11007950","11010230"," Bulls holding on or bears holding on at the moment."
"11010570","11011370"," You can see him selling. "
"11012250","11014090"," See the crossover still there right."
"11014910","11015870"," See the cross right here."
"11017070","11018030"," White over red. "
"11019230","11020750"," Sellers stepped in here successfully."
"11021570","11022710"," They're trying to do it again right here."
"11026310","11027750"," Still trying to push down right now. "
"11027750","11031210"," So far bears still in charge of the day."
"11031350","11032010"," Boring as fuck."
"11032310","11032970"," Friday's nip. "
"11033350","11035610"," It's a rare case that Fridays are like this."
"11036050","11036690"," It's not normal."
"11037730","11040730"," I was talking to you earlier briefly about maybe buying some calls. "
"11042070","11045350"," I wouldn't go crazy out of the money like three cents or 17 cents."
"11045670","11048050"," But like slightly out of the money 30, 40, 50 delta."
"11048670","11051330"," And some puts 30, 40, 50 delta somewhere in there. "
"11051930","11052910"," And you can trade both sides."
"11053530","11054530"," Take whatever way we are breaking."
"11055510","11056470"," We might trade sideways. "
"11056470","11057790"," We are coming in and a quarter."
"11058310","11060010"," But it doesn't always happen here."
"11060590","11062890"," We're going to return to the seat of the crime here. "
"11063270","11065110"," We're going to return to the seat of the crime up here."
"11066250","11068170"," Reset shorts for next week for bears."
"11069170","11069530"," Possible. "
"11071130","11072170"," Being entertained at least."
"11073850","11075070"," The one minute chart right now."
"11078150","11080190"," And the longer we spend here, the more bullish it becomes. "
"11080270","11081290"," We want you to realize that too."
"11081350","11085450"," If you're just joining us for the first time, the more time we spend sideways here, the more"
"11085450","11086410"," bullish we actually become."
"11086410","11090730"," You guys are allowing the one minute and the five minute to this red line and this white line. "
"11090970","11095070"," The more time that we spend here, the more bullish we actually become."
"11095270","11096010"," We want you to realize that."
"11096590","11097330"," So hold on. "
"11099230","11107110"," If we spend time here in a day and you see us spending time here, then price is above the"
"11107110","11109830"," white line and prices above the red line."
"11110530","11111990"," And we spend a lot of time here."
"11113170","11117250"," These two are going to push up price and you will get a squeeze. "
"11119170","11122190"," It will start to actually squeeze pretty violently to the upside."
"11124370","11126190"," So at least the SPX will spy will."
"11126850","11127010"," Yes. "
"11128210","11129830"," And we're watching it happen right now in real time."
"11130010","11131850"," So we're getting there."
"11132250","11133870"," It's getting squeezy. "
"11134150","11134410"," Again."
"11136810","11137910"," Very squeezy here."
"11138690","11140370"," So put your seat belts on, boys and girls. "
"11148580","11150360"," Getting squeezy once more here for the bulls."
"11152320","11153300"," It's now 114."
"11155180","11156060"," Bulls want to get. "
"11156360","11157120"," The time is here."
"11158680","11159240"," We have a failure."
"11159460","11160320"," So we got to do how I hear. "
"11160640","11161380"," We got a failure here."
"11161680","11162280"," That's not bullish."
"11163520","11166360"," So we could see one more roll coming down over here. "
"11168140","11170500"," Try to get that support and get up here and get that squeeze going."
"11171100","11173840"," Surely expecting results from the federal versus repat facility."
"11177280","11179260"," Want to squeeze, see the squeeze like right now. "
"11180620","11182740"," Like right on the 15 minute where that we're on right now."
"11182860","11185780"," If we don't see it, we'll probably see a roll down into the 130 hour."
"11186020","11187240"," And then maybe you get that squeeze higher. "
"11193450","11195090"," Keep that right there for you."
"11203810","11206250"," Let's go on Twitter and see what their ship posting."
"11211130","11212210"," Cocaine bear says. "
"11213430","11215890"," Cocaine bear says I put the high and hiker."
"11216790","11218110"," He's not on fin to it."
"11218310","11218890"," This is the movie. "
"11223190","11225710"," Looks like he's weighing in on the stock market now."
"11228710","11229450"," Andy constant."
"11230250","11230890"," I was making a post. "
"11231070","11232410"," He said I was asked a question."
"11233210","11236950"," Under what conditions will the Fed do actual QE and buy treasuries?"
"11236950","11240990"," Mortgages and maybe other assets assets."
"11241290","11246210"," It's simple when 0% fed funds proves to be ineffective in offsetting a deflationary recession"
"11246210","11246530"," depression. "
"11246870","11248350"," It will do QE again."
"11248590","11249710"," That's absolutely true."
"11251090","11254250"," But he also makes a very good point. "
"11254270","11255590"," He said not a moment sooner."
"11256030","11256790"," I agree with that too."
"11258850","11259670"," That's a good one. "
"11259770","11260570"," He really does a good."
"11260870","11264690"," It is a really good job of saying things plainly."
"11270150","11271230"," What else do I see here?"
"11272810","11273690"," I'm fin to it. "
"11292110","11292710"," The consumer."
"11293310","11293950"," How long was she?"
"11294330","11294910"," Keep hiking."
"11296750","11299590"," Yeah, if you're a long time bully, you probably want to see us keep hiking too. "
"11302270","11304230"," If you're a young person, you want to see us keep hiking."
"11304870","11305090"," You should."
"11305910","11307190"," I guess unless you don't care. "
"11307730","11310630"," Unless you don't mind paying a bunch more."
"11310630","11312530"," I mean, that is another answer too, right?"
"11313910","11319590"," Another answer is that we don't ever complete our hiking cycle and then we just pay more."
"11320150","11323770"," Part of that, we talk about that in stream that we're just buying time. "
"11324110","11326050"," But they won't actually ever be able to beat inflation."
"11326650","11331570"," So what like their plan C is spend enough time."
"11333070","11339570"," Spend enough time for you to spend enough time for you to accept higher prices. "
"11339570","11344430"," So if their tools don't work, you'll just accept it."
"11345190","11345990"," Higher prices."
"11347170","11349130"," And you probably will in a lot of stuff anyways. "
"11350110","11355130"," We know that companies can only raise prices every decade or two or we have major events."
"11362800","11363960"," What else do I see here?"
"11374820","11377180"," Looks like some people are posting about GME."
"11383730","11386210"," Sunrise trader is making a great post right now. "
"11386250","11387710"," He said he made a cool post."
"11387870","11392710"," He said, sometimes I find a chart that on a quick glance looks great."
"11393670","11398130"," So then I run it through a series of questions, including risk versus possible reward. "
"11398830","11400990"," Many times the homework stops right there."
"11401210","11401410"," Agreed."
"11408620","11413800"," So Douglas Fuller is saying zero stocks in the Aztec 100 are in the Webby power trend. "
"11414340","11417120"," Number two in S&P 500 is FSLR KR."
"11417700","11421100"," Number two, I'm a watch list FSLR LNTH."
"11421640","11423400"," You know, that's a fair point. "
"11423760","11426640"," So like you're looking at, you're not seeing the spy squeeze up, right?"
"11426880","11434120"," But really, if you see sub sectors screaming higher, you see XL U screaming higher, XLP screaming"
"11434120","11434660"," higher today."
"11435580","11442700"," You might get just enough of the in Aztec holding its pants up to help the S&P go higher,"
"11442700","11448860"," which I want you to look on book map and you see we're back to the rug pull again."

"11453820","11454840"," This is the rug pull."
"11455000","11457500"," See it gone and price just blast lower."
"11458600","11464060"," Seeing a quick bear flag, but a big bear airplane forming right now. "
"11464320","11467000"," We don't like seeing price down here if you are a bull."
"11467600","11469120"," I'm not going to draw it out for you guys."
"11469260","11470280"," I've already seen it so many times. "
"11470360","11470720"," That's enough."
"11471100","11472640"," You should be able to pick this out on your own."
"11472640","11477060"," And identify a bear airplane forming at least on the one minute. "
"11477120","11479080"," Let's look in the five minute and see if you can see it some more."
"11479860","11480900"," Not quite there yet."
"11481540","11484540"," On the five minute chart at least, this doesn't look as bearish. "
"11484840","11491420"," If you guys trade the Jedi Marcus white paper, then this is a potential dip by still four on the"
"11491420","11491860"," five minutes."
"11491860","11492980"," We haven't seen it here quite yet."
"11493440","11498700"," Although we know that the hourly, the 15 minute is showing a bear airplane still in play. "
"11499380","11501720"," So we'll keep it on the five minute right here and just see what happens."
"11503320","11506200"," This is the dip by reposition a K bull trap area here."
"11508100","11513580"," We want to see price stay above 39246 for the case to go higher here. "

"11528460","11530160"," HYG is on some support right now."
"11530300","11538860"," I want to see HYG stay above 7354 for a squeeze here."
"11554190","11555470"," I am long again here. "
"11556770","11562050"," Not the best positioning, but I'm going to see if we can get some action on the upside here, at"

"12016580","12022760"," And when I want you to be aware of your new follower, I want you to see something here as"
"12022760","12030300"," this line comes up and crosses the green line and the white line crosses here."
"12032830","12033790"," Not the yellow line."
"12033910","12039650"," The white, the red and this green bar that represents, I can't, this isn't an EMA so I can't put"
"12039650","12040070"," it on here. "
"12041610","12048210"," But when all these, when we get this cluster here, it forms an emotional response to the market."
"12048710","12054610"," So in the closer and closer we get the more emotional the erratic the price will act."
"12055330","12063850"," So my point here is as long as price stays above here, it should rip faces up here. "
"12064550","12070790"," Now if price starts to break below, you want to have some stops or whatever, whatever kind of risk"
"12070790","12074550"," off you're trying to take here because this can get violent to the downside as well."
"12078650","12081750"," Oh, yeah, ooh, right there."
"12084130","12086310"," Exploratory to the upside right now. "
"12087790","12090290"," We've got the doctors now in the office."
"12091270","12092690"," He is now knocked on the door."
"12094650","12095290"," Excuse me. "
"12096970","12099790"," May I enter the office right now?"
"12100190","12101550"," And so you're like, yes, doctor."
"12103150","12107170"," And you're like, uh, Mr. Mr. Furryhead."
"12109170","12112450"," Dr. Dr. Bullish here. "
"12115050","12116970"," We're going to need to examine you."
"12118330","12125830"," And Dr. or patient, uh, Harryhead is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"12130100","12133080"," Dr. Bull is putting on the gloves. "
"12134980","12139220"," And he goes over to the desk and he grabs his pump."
"12141080","12143460"," He squishes that at it a few times."
"12144400","12145520"," He's like, damn it. "
"12147460","12148740"," We're all a lot of lube."
"12152320","12156040"," Takes a look at his gloves and he's like, we're just gonna have to make do without."
"12159970","12164130"," So he asks Mr. Harry test to, uh, take a seat on the examination table. "
"12166990","12171050"," And he warms up those gloves, gets them nice and sticky."
"12171830","12176050"," Like, you know, and you have like, uh, latex gloves, they're just before they start to melt, they"
"12176050","12176810"," can get a good grab."
"12179010","12184010"," And we're going to start to probe here and see if everything is okay up there. "
"12195460","12197900"," So I got to get some, I got to get some latex gloves."
"12198540","12201280"," Uh, I'm gonna make a note of that."
"12201480","12206100"," Add latex gloves to the, uh, add latex gloves. "
"12207220","12210360"," For the examination process, latex gloves."
"12212000","12218760"," Uh, when I probably get some pump lotion, I'll pump with some lotion on it."
"12221920","12228380"," Maybe I'll get like a box of sand and I'll like, I'll put the latex gloves on, then I'll lube"
"12228380","12231040"," them up and then I'll dip them in sand on stream. "
"12235340","12238440"," I'm starting the examination process here."
"12239540","12247200"," You'll feel some slight pain, uh, but it won't be as bad as, as if I had had my, uh,"
"12247400","12248900"," my nails unclipped at this point."
"12249960","12252720"," Uh, just, just, I'm gonna hold on here. "
"12253880","12254920"," I'm almost in."
"12256840","12257560"," Here we go."
"12260000","12261020"," Here we go. "
"12261600","12262520"," See how easy that was?"
"12262980","12263640"," Nice and easy."
"12265140","12266460"," Uh, just give me a moment, sir."
"12266600","12271660"," I'm gonna call in the, um, some, uh, some help here. "
"12271940","12273940"," I'm gonna call the one in the five minutes."
"12274040","12277000"," It'll give me a hand here to just make sure we have found everything."
"12277840","12279640"," Make sure there's nothing we haven't missed at this point. "
"12280580","12282960"," Uh, can the one in five minutes please come join me over here?"
"12283520","12290140"," Uh, I need you to hold down the patient here as we, uh, do some more probing."
"12292860","12302620"," Oh, wait a minute, what happened there?"
"12309220","12310440"," Well, I lost something here."
"12316920","12318620"," Ah, relaxing clap. "
"12321120","12323820"," I'm gonna just do some probing, some quick probing here."
"12324600","12334560"," Uh, do you mind, uh, assistant just, uh, showing us on"
"12334560","12338340"," the x-ray table, if there's anywhere above where you need to go?"
"12341040","12344560"," And we can see now, uh, we have some places to look above."
"12369480","12371760"," If they have found the gerbil they've gone too far. "
"12387260","12392880"," 1-800, uh, one last second here."
"12393540","12396680"," I got, I got, I got, I got some, I got some, uh, you guys won't, I don't do any"
"12396680","12398900"," ship, I don't do as much ship posting as I used to."
"12400500","12402460"," I do it, but not, not as much of these. "
"12402600","12404060"," We're making some ship posting real quick."
"12442140","12443540"," Oh, yeah, there it is."
"12444000","12446200"," There is a little ship posted on FinTwit. "
"12447940","12453300"," Now trade 73 cents on 395Cs as we probe the patient."
"12467710","12468670"," Now probing."
"12475250","12476570"," Hey, uh, what do you got here?"
"12476770","12478770"," Maverick Eyes is new to the program. "
"12481170","12484110"," Maverick Eyes, well, you're looking out here on the left side of your screen."
"12484230","12484430"," Let me see."
"12484650","12485650"," Is that where, was this where I am?"
"12485730","12486810"," Is it my left hand side of the screen?"
"12487590","12488410"," Can you answer me that?"
"12499550","12503270"," This is, uh, just posted on FinTwit the trading pattern we're in right now. "
"12503970","12510380"," We're now in this trading pattern right here on FinTwit that I just posted."
"12514770","12515600"," Okay."
"12517270","12518770"," Current trading pattern. "
"12569850","12575180"," I love Fridays."
"12576020","12579500"," After a long week, I missed, I missed Twitter, man."
"12579800","12580380"," I miss it. "
"12589200","12590960"," Let's chase you like that one, don't you?"
"12599540","12604580"," Well, we've got someone asking in the, uh, so Maverick Eyes is saying, hey, I'm new here as the"
"12604580","12605520"," options day trading."
"12605880","12607100"," Was this options day trading?"
"12607320","12607680"," Yes, it is."
"12608780","12609420"," Can you explain?"
"12609620","12611120"," We're looking out on the left side of the screen. "
"12611700","12613540"," Uh, you know, the hand that I lifted."
"12613840","12613980"," Okay."
"12614140","12617040"," So Maverick trading, um, this is liquidity. "
"12617800","12620640"," Now, this is by sell orders, standing orders in the market."
"12621440","12627840"," Uh, and the colors represent, uh, the number of, the number of buyers and sellers, the strength of"
"12627840","12630680"," buyers and sellers, the ones that are at least showing themselves."
"12631360","12635080"," There are some other tools here that can show hidden orders for buy and sell. "
"12636140","12640160"," And we're looking for, uh, we're looking for, this is the ES chart."
"12640160","12645940"," It gives a, ES gives a really good representation unlike, uh, cash market, standing in buy and sell"
"12645940","12646220"," orders."
"12646480","12646900"," I want to say that. "
"12647260","12648000"," Good question."
"12648620","12653240"," Uh, what it's doing is it's going to tell you where, where true buyers and sellers are."
"12653960","12656100"," And we're looking for liquidity above and below. "
"12656280","12658540"," Do we have more sellers above, more buyers below?"
"12659120","12660340"," Where's the smart money at as well?"
"12660340","12663200"," Like where are the smart buyers at where the smart sellers are at?"
"12664380","12669380"," Uh, and then, you know, you'll see classic, you'll see traditional charting with pivot points."
"12670320","12671540"," You'll, oh, there we go."
"12671720","12674100"," See that big red, see that big yellow bar just popped open. "
"12674280","12675580"," That was hidden liquidity above."
"12676880","12681460"," And so you're looking like, let's say you use pivots for your support and resistance levels."
"12681860","12685260"," Let's say you use bands or any kind of tools that you have for yourself. "
"12685600","12692400"," We're using this as one tool amongst many, um, to show how strong resistance or support is in the"
"12692400","12692660"," market."
"12693600","12700480"," We layer this, uh, with velocity and momentum, um, in the market, in liquidity, in the market, in"
"12700480","12701100"," other other ways."
"12701460","12703800"," And then, uh, pivot points in previous trading history. "
"12704420","12707260"," If you want to know more, I would recommend that you join us."
"12709620","12711860"," I would recommend that you join us in the discord."

"12729280","12730580"," It's free to hop in there."
"12731340","12732360"," We don't charge anything."
"12736080","12739940"," And, uh, there are some great, uh, long time, we've got professionals in there too. "
"12740040","12741340"," We've got professional traders in there."

"12744220","12745740"," We have, uh, all kinds of education and stuff. "
"12746300","12750760"," I do want to say to you though, uh, one thing that, uh, if you ever going to trade with"
"12750760","12757420"," the live that I prefer that you pay for trade it, uh, or you become familiar, uh, with, with what"
"12757420","12760820"," we're doing here rather than just pop it in a stream and being like, yeah, I'm going to trade with"
"12760820","12761140"," this guy."
"12761400","12766100"," I would recommend that you never take trades that I take, uh, for multitude of reasons and that you"
"12766100","12770240"," would definitely seek out the advice of a financial advisor as I am not one for you."
"12770880","12776460"," Um, so, but if you want to hang out, uh, if you're, if you're tired of, uh, sometimes I find"
"12776460","12780740"," that, uh, uh, traders are only available certain, certain hours of the week. "
"12780740","12781720"," They're not there every day."
"12782360","12788280"," And then I find that, um, also you'll find live streams where you find people that are just"
"12788280","12789780"," bragging like, hey, you like my jet."
"12789840","12790620"," You like my Lambo. "
"12791320","12793740"," Um, people won't tell you what their positioning is."
"12793740","12795260"," So they always look like they're winning."
"12795940","12797400"," You'll see me win and lose here. "
"12798180","12800640"," You'll see like the light, the real life of a day trader."
"12801260","12805880"," Um, not a, not a fake life or bullshit or coming out afterwards and telling you what I was a,"
"12805980","12807880"," a winner on and not telling what losers are."
"12808740","12813800"," Um, and I try to keep it, uh, uh, not as technical either. "
"12813800","12819100"," So we're just kind of hanging out, uh, rather than, uh, me speaking where it's something you don't"
"12819100","12819340"," understand."
"12820240","12825960"," Um, you can go, everybody has their, I felt like when I was learning that I was in a routine,"
"12825960","12826320"," right?"
"12826940","12831880"," So I'm reading books, um, listening in to someone teaching me something, like options, industry"
"12831880","12834120"," council was a great place to learn how to trade options."
"12834840","12835400"," Uh, it's free. "
"12835680","12837000"," You don't have to pay anybody for a class."
"12837760","12840160"," Uh, options industry council offers a full suite."
"12840560","12844680"," It's a nonprofit that's supported by, um, the exchanges. "
"12845480","12850060"," Uh, I think the CME actually supports, uh, that, that training for you."
"12850060","12851060"," So you can actually get that there."
"12851520","12853340"," It's a good, uh, good resource for you. "
"12854860","12859340"," Um, so you're never going to hear me like talk to in a way that you might not understand and"
"12859340","12862020"," try to simplify concepts for you that you might want to learn somewhere else."
"12864240","12866600"," And then, uh, what else did I say to you?"
"12867800","12870700"," If you're, uh, what else did I say to you on this topic?"
"12871520","12872080"," That's about it."
"12873560","12874740"," Join us in the discord, man. "
"12879300","12880640"," Hey, thanks, Maverick, guys."
"12885080","12889900"," Thinking it's like, uh, I don't want to say it's like Joe Rogan because, uh, maybe old school Joe"
"12889900","12894180"," Rogan, um, just chatting."
"12894920","12898280"," Uh, and then inside the chat, you'll find traders and they'll talk about their positioning. "
"12898780","12902560"," Uh, you'll also find people in the chat will drop, uh, news."
"12902920","12907300"," You'll, there's a guy named Chase Winter and he reports what other people are doing out there."
"12907820","12910980"," Uh, so you'll see him, uh, dropping, dropping some good knowledge bombs. "
"12911120","12914940"," You'll find, uh, real traders are trading and they'll put their positioning."
"12915240","12920260"," I'm, uh, opening, closing their positions on different, multiple time frames."
"12920260","12924840"," Right now we're trading a, uh, right currently we're looking at a one minute chart right here, but"
"12924840","12932900"," we do cycle through one, five, 15 minutes, uh, one hour charts, uh, daily charts, that kind of"
"12932900","12933120"," stuff. "
"12933480","12936280"," I'll, at the end of every day, I'll tell you what I expect in the coming days."
"12937540","12941720"," Um, how I'm positioned into a close, uh, all that kind of stuff."
"12944670","12945590"," Thanks for asking, man. "
"12949280","12949980"," And welcome."
"12950440","12955000"," And as a matter of fact, uh, one last thing Maverick guys I'd say to you is that a lot"
"12955000","12958420"," of communities are kind of, uh, rough and this one's not."
"12958660","12963520"," So if you're looking for a place, uh, to join, join in a, join, just raise your hand and say"
"12963520","12964000"," I don't know anybody. "
"12965260","12968900"," Uh, if you're on Twitter, you can ask people for their Twitter handles."
"12969120","12973700"," If you're looking for some people to join as a community, you want some friends, um, something like"
"12973700","12973880"," that."
"12973880","12977440"," Uh, don't hesitate to stick your hand up and say, Hey, I'm new here. "
"12988560","12988920"," Yeah."
"12988920","12991720"," You'll never get DMS from me asking for you for money."
"12992100","12993240"," Uh, I wanted to warn you of that. "
"12993320","12997040"," If you ever get an email asking you to pay anything, you'll never get that from me."
"12997820","12999080"," Uh, you'll never get me."
"12999600","13003100"," Um, you'll never get like, uh, sexual offers for me. "
"13003240","13006120"," You'll never get any kind of weirdness from me."
"13006280","13006920"," None of that stuff."
"13008720","13009160"," Yeah. "
"13009320","13010220"," So don't ever expect it."
"13010620","13016150"," I don't know what's going on here with the book map right now."
"13023120","13024800"," Getting some, uh, a lesson here. "
"13027810","13028970"," Getting some walkiness."
"13037450","13039370"," I'm gonna say I'm gonna do something in the background."
"13051180","13052060"," Yeah, still there. "
"13052740","13062660"," It's an artifact that's, uh, part of a little"
"13062660","13063500"," bit of weakness right now."
"13063580","13068160"," Some seller stepping in above at the pivot point at PT one tagged PT one, at least."
"13068420","13069620"," We maybe got there close enough. "
"13069780","13075440"," We still haven't ground out or taken out some of this, this gray area above is a gap that was"
"13075440","13079520"," left behind, still haven't taken it out, still holding on to the one minute right now."
"13080460","13083400"," Now the five minute proved itself over here."
"13083980","13086660"," And what I don't like, so we got the new high on the five minute here. "
"13086660","13091520"," So I want to show you came back down."
"13091700","13092940"," We retested the five minute."
"13093060","13093400"," It was good. "
"13093920","13096400"," Retested the five minute once again, got a new high."
"13096760","13097460"," That's positive."
"13097980","13098780"," Coming back down. "
"13098940","13104120"," This is showing you the not quite weakness, but just not the thrust that we need to get up."
"13104120","13108000"," It looks like it's going to be trying to do this bullshit here into the close."
"13109060","13113700"," We're not seeing any kind of conviction, uh, to the upward downside into this bell. "
"13114160","13118920"," Uh, this might be, we might be having some kind of a pin, uh, into this close."
"13118920","13120860"," Maybe there's some, some spreads out there."
"13120900","13123520"," They're trying to hold on to, uh, into this bell. "
"13123640","13125240"," Maybe somebody's got a bunch of three ninety threes."
"13125680","13127220"," I'm kind of scratching my head on that."
"13127320","13128480"," Or they don't want something to print. "
"13129220","13133020"," They don't want fourth out 400 or 4000 to print into this close."
"13133200","13138120"," They don't want three ninety to print something like that into this bell."
"13138320","13139600"," This is unusual for a Friday. "
"13140140","13143800"," As you all know, usually even Fridays, well actually I shouldn't say that."
"13144200","13149940"," Normally on a Friday, you get your first move, uh, by by 10 30 11 30 in the morning."
"13150720","13152020"," Usually a pretty major move. "
"13152140","13153820"," We had a nice move down in the overnight."
"13154480","13160980"," Uh, we usually are done though by like 11 30 or so days over usually on on, uh, spy typically"
"13160980","13162100"," for years, right?"
"13162940","13168220"," Uh, but this recently Fridays, not recently, like recently the past year Fridays have been big"
"13168220","13170320"," mover days in one direction or the other."
"13170760","13176160"," Uh, and I mean big, like this isn't a big move up on a Friday or a big move down"
"13176160","13176660"," on a Friday. "
"13176980","13178360"," 50, 70 points at least."
"13179240","13180940"," Uh, sometimes a hundred points in any direction."
"13181720","13183980"," Uh, we just, we're just not seeing that on this Friday. "
"13184540","13190040"," Uh, this is actually more typical, uh, of a Friday action in the normalized market, believe it or"
"13190040","13190260"," not."
"13190680","13192740"," Uh, so Friday today it's been kind of a bore."
"13193020","13198280"," So we've been in here trying to entertain ourselves, uh, with all kinds of stories and stuff like"
"13198280","13198580"," that. "
"13199080","13202740"," Uh, but otherwise this is, this is a real slow trade and day here."
"13203340","13207180"," Now it looks like people are closing out, uh, positions around the market today."
"13224940","13225740"," Let me see here. "
"13227500","13228760"," There's not much going on."
"13229320","13230460"," Uh, this is also Friday."
"13230740","13234160"," So, uh, normally we have a drink together on Fridays. "
"13234520","13235800"," So today we're gonna have a bear."
"13236140","13237840"," It's, uh, 149 in the afternoon."
"13239340","13243000"," And we also on Fridays typically have a talk about what to expect for next week. "
"13243960","13244780"," Uh, so we will start that."
"13244960","13250360"," We'll probably start with looking at, uh, what's going to take place or what to expect for next"
"13250360","13250660"," week."
"13251560","13257260"," Some, some ideas into next week, uh, into the coming weeks on the S on SPX. "
"13257260","13261480"," And then we'll do a brief outline on, uh, tech."
"13262960","13267740"," This morning, if you're just joining us or recently joining us this morning, I went over, uh, what,"
"13267740","13276900"," what I'm, what I'm expecting into Q two, uh, dependent upon where we close on the quarterly expiry"
"13276900","13277740"," on the monthly."
"13278760","13280020"," That's on the 31st. "
"13280180","13282080"," And then what comes out for the JPM caller?"
"13283200","13287940"," Uh, so I want to see what the caller is in the 31st."
"13288120","13291740"," I want to see what the closing price is on the 31st."
"13292320","13294920"," I was going to make a decision as to my positioning for the next quarter. "
"13295820","13301220"," Uh, but we'll look into next week and see what we'll look at the economic news available to us next"
"13301220","13301500"," week."
"13302140","13305340"," The range that we trade are probable trade for next week."
"13306120","13308380"," And then we'll have a bear together at the end of the day. "
"13309340","13312460"," Um, yeah, we'll see what happens here."
"13312920","13318520"," And we talked earlier too about maybe a fly into, um, into quarterly expiration."
"13318720","13322860"," Normally the market starts to be range bound as we head into quarterly expiry as well. "
"13323440","13328440"," Like month end, I should, I should be more clear here into month ends."
"13328580","13329480"," We'll take a look at that right now."
"13330560","13332800"," So we got a lot, we got a lot to take care of. "
"13332860","13336340"," If you're looking for this to, to sell off here, I'm not seeing it just yet."
"13337140","13338340"," Uh, the trend is still up."
"13339360","13341340"," I'm expecting to try to buy this right here. "
"13342000","13345120"," Uh, I've got a trade on right now long and into the close."
"13345500","13348220"," If we do break below here, I make this crossover."
"13348900","13350000"," I'll close that trade. "
"13350680","13354620"," I don't know that I'll take a put trade here, maybe, or maybe I'll leave that I might even leave"
"13354620","13356080"," these calls on and add some puts."
"13356600","13359980"," Uh, depending upon if you have a break higher or break lower to this bell, then you can take a"
"13359980","13361460"," two sided trade and make it a strangle."
"13361880","13364680"," I'm going to start a straddle, not a strangle into the bell. "
"13365240","13370560"," I would be a loser here if we trade right into this close like this with that trade."
"13374790","13375830"," So let's take a quick look."
"13376370","13379210"," Now, if you're a bearish here, uh, your crossover is forming. "
"13379630","13381990"," If we do, I'll show you what the crossover looks like."
"13381990","13382930"," This is a one minute chart."
"13383910","13385910"," Um, let's look at both real quick though. "
"13385990","13386830"," Actually, let's close this up."
"13386950","13387930"," Let's look at a five minute real quick."
"13393050","13394270"," Still not bearish yet. "
"13394850","13397150"," Just come back down and test this one more time again."
"13398430","13400310"," Uh, just a slow grind up."
"13400330","13402690"," So a five minute right now, still bullish. "
"13406230","13408110"," Still bullish nonsense, believe it or not."
"13408350","13411970"," Um, on a higher time frame, a 15 minute and hourly were bearish here."
"13412350","13413710"," So I'll show you the 15 minute. "
"13414610","13418870"," Uh, seller is still above trying to tee off, positioning possibly for next week."
"13419130","13420130"," I don't know why that is."
"13420650","13423830"," Uh, I don't see bloodbath into quarter ends typically. "
"13424550","13426090"," So I don't know how anyone else is."
"13426710","13427930"," You got one on me out here."
"13428070","13433250"," If something I haven't seen too often would be like a major bloodbath into the last week of the"
"13433250","13433450"," quarter. "
"13433730","13440490"," If I'm wrong on that, let me know because I usually see pinning actions, uh, into what I recall is"
"13440490","13442630"," always that a quarter end is, is painting."
"13443050","13446770"," As a matter of fact, I'm going to mute the book map real quick and just show you here."
"13447550","13450090"," Uh, you can see it right here, right?"
"13450350","13451050"," You can see like that. "
"13451050","13456290"," To me, what looks like painting action into the, into next week, some kind of nonsense like this,"
"13456950","13459590"," that minimum, something like that right there."
"13460190","13465530"," Even if we trade higher into this balanced area above, it's not looking like crazy town to me."
"13466110","13468390"," Uh, for, for quarter end. "
"13468830","13474190"," It looks like positioning by large, uh, fat institutions trying to get their prints printed."
"13474810","13478450"," Uh, not, you got dealers that don't want certain prints to print."
"13478670","13480550"," Dealers aren't going to want to print 3600. "
"13481190","13484830"," Dealers aren't going to want to print, uh, fat print above 4060."
"13485350","13490990"," Uh, so just parking this, parking this pig right into, in my view, parking this pig right into"
"13490990","13491650"," quarter end."
"13492350","13494370"," Uh, so what else we got here?"
"13495330","13495850"," Let me see. "
"13496070","13499390"," It's looking, uh, we do have a bearish cross here."
"13499470","13500330"," I want you to be aware of that."
"13500450","13502850"," There is a bearish cross into Friday today. "
"13503730","13506870"," So we're going to get SPX and we're going to just cover next week."
"13508770","13514090"," And we're going to look at, um, we're going to look at the options, what, what the options market"
"13514090","13521540"," is pricing in to, uh, next week's trading."
"13522400","13531500"," And we already know that we have, we already know that we have, um, let's see here"
"13531500","13535580"," to be and take a look at the put call ratio as well. "
"13539210","13542270"," Yeah, I'll tell you what, if I take a week off, that would probably be next week."
"13542790","13546930"," If I take next week off and we'll trade this range all next week, likely."
"13547490","13550210"," If you're going to take a week off vacation, it's probably this week too. "
"13550950","13554730"," If you're going to wait a week to put a position on for the next three months, probably wait this"
"13554730","13555650"," week out and just hang out."
"13559250","13560710"," They become yawned fast, typically."
"13561270","13562750"," Uh, put call ratio rate today. "
"13563170","13565130"," Uh, this calculation is based upon yesterday."
"13565650","13568950"," It's at 0.77, uh, though it's on the uptick."
"13569230","13572670"," So we're going to expect like a bunch of bearish shit heading into next week. "
"13573110","13575310"," That could drive us higher, believe it or not."
"13575410","13581190"," Now, matter of fact, I'm watching this right now and I'm watching more bearishness, uh, bearish"
"13581190","13584530"," trades right now with the past couple of weeks into today the 23rd."
"13584910","13586890"," It started back on the 16th. "
"13587350","13588710"," Uh, so right in here."
"13590450","13592950"," Uh, do we're going to squeeze up?"
"13593230","13597970"," I think we're going to, I think we're going to force a 46 because we just got bearish trades,"
"13597970","13601330"," bearish trades and expect more bearish trades in the end of quarter."
"13602390","13607950"," Uh, trying to re retard the market down, trying to pin this market down, but it could end up having"
"13607950","13609630"," an opposite effect and push desire. "
"13610550","13611310"," Hold on a second here."
"13611390","13613490"," We're going to get some water losing my voice already in the week."
"13619930","13621830"," Now, you know what the call ratio is?"
"13621890","13623510"," You know, it's on the, on the up and up coming up. "
"13630270","13632750"," Uh, one week, let's look just into this week."
"13635900","13643670"," So into the 31st, 401 55."
"13652430","13653370"," Hold on here. "
"13669390","13670590"," 401 63."
"13679450","13680870"," March 22nd."
"13682210","13684630"," Yeah, it's pretty close to where we are right now. "
"13688370","13689630"," Let's get rid of this for a moment."
"13690730","13695830"," So the options market for next week has got us priced in right here."
"13696870","13701870"," So an SPX, uh, not trading above four zero. "
"13702310","13705010"," Uh, let me get a more, more exact number for you here."
"13707870","13713590"," So right now the options market has SPX, um, max top 404631."
"13713590","13719350"," So I guess maybe I am a little bit on Andy's side, but I'm still going to say we can"
"13719350","13719990"," trade up there. "
"13720010","13721610"," We got a gap to fill above two."
"13722330","13725150"," Um, let's get rid of this one here."
"13725610","13730190"," And then down on the downside risk for at least priced in for next week. "
"13732050","13733410"," 384 92."
"13739670","13741590"," 384 92."
"13743010","13743990"," Right here. "
"13746830","13749050"," So let's look at this for a minute for next week."
"13749710","13750870"," This is 331."
"13750870","13758490"," Uh, if we're going to, if, if we squeeze up into the spell here, maybe to get more liquidity to"
"13758490","13764610"," head down into next week, uh, it might be a good trade up here into next week to grab some"
"13764610","13770290"," kind of liquidity in a Friday, uh, with maybe a put spread that you can maybe monetize at some"
"13770290","13772570"," point into Friday. "
"13772870","13775590"," If there's weakness as we, uh, re hedge the next quarter."
"13776590","13779350"," Uh, so this is a good, good data position into next week."
"13779470","13785370"," If you want to position in some kind of a spread, um, upside risk to currently right now up to"
"13785370","13792110"," a 404 61 is actually a nice place to also grab some kind of a fly on the end of"
"13792110","13792610"," week, right?"
"13793130","13796150"," Something way up high here and then something way down low down here. "
"13797410","13803170"," I try to capture this kind of nonsense that you're going to see into quarter end over here."
"13803430","13807530"," I don't have any expectation that we crash, uh, into Friday."
"13807790","13813570"," I think it's a, it's a, a tail risk, but not, not something to expect here. "
"13813830","13816950"," Now that doesn't mean we're not freed up to crash after."
"13817170","13823850"," If, if, if, you know, the, the, the, the JPM positioning in their hedge is going to possibly panic"
"13823850","13828470"," the market or, uh, make the market think we're going higher as well."
"13828490","13834910"," It can have an effect on, on, um, sentiment, uh, but this is our range and we're right in the"
"13834910","13835790"," middle of it right now. "
"13836150","13838890"," Right in the middle of our range heading into a Friday here."
"13840730","13847590"," Uh, so theta games probably happier, like super happy here being in the middle of our implied move"
"13847590","13848210"," for next week."
"13850270","13854150"," Now our three month, we are seeing range expansion. "
"13855790","13861010"," Uh, so into, into, um, at least June."
"13867370","13869310"," Let's look at, uh, July."
"13871770","13876270"," So into quarter end of Q three, we're looking at, uh, target above a four, 22. "
"13876570","13879230"," I'm paying interest in 2022 target."
"13879530","13882270"," 58 spot, eight billion dollars in 2022."
"13882510","13885890"," So just in your, in your spot, nine billion dollars in 2021. "
"13886190","13891890"," And the fed said they were returned 76 billion dollars to the treasury in 2022 and 109 million"
"13891890","13894510"," billion dollars in 2021."
"13895670","13902770"," So in your planning, when you're planning next week for quarterly OPEX, currently we're this kind"
"13902770","13904830"," of this, I mean, this, this shit doesn't mean anything."
"13904970","13908810"," I'll be honest with you because you get the collar come out and it's going to tell you something"
"13908810","13909290"," different. "
"13909290","13911190"," It could change the options market."
"13912070","13919610"," Like long projections on, on, um, on, um, on how the, how the options market is priced or implied"
"13919610","13921230"," for the move can change."
"13921230","13927290"," That says good asset capturing turned to 19th income at 16 spot, six billion dollars by the end of"
"13927290","13927810"," 2022. "
"13928010","13930270"," Does somebody been doing dishes there all day long?"
"13931110","13937790"," So, uh, you know, like the, the implied move in the market changes, right?"
"13938150","13942790"," Uh, so it's only as good as the paper that it's written on and you need other information to the"
"13942790","13943170"," tick."
"13943570","13949870"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"13950190","13955290"," Currently the market is pricing in a move to 420 and I'm going to move the downside to four, uh,"
"13955470","13957570"," 360 for the next three months."
"13958230","13962310"," So, uh, that gives you any insights maybe into next week. "
"13962870","13963830"," Now there it is."
"13972610","13973010"," Yeah."
"13973130","13974750"," And I like the idea of a spread into next week. "
"13974950","13980330"," I like the idea of, if you're bearish here, I like the idea that I like the idea of, I"
"13980330","13985270"," like the idea of your bearish here that you could like withstand this crap here and come down here"
"13985270","13986890"," possibly during hedging."
"13986890","13994610"," Like if you get blown out as a bear and you start seeing those violent moves down into, um, into"
"13994610","14000410"," the actual end of month, you could probably salvage those things, uh, at least get a print on them"
"14000410","14001870"," if the move doesn't go your way."
"14002050","14003710"," And the best trade is probably a theta trade. "
"14004110","14005070"," I'll be honest with you."
"14005150","14011650"," Maybe someone that trades, uh, sells or buys flies out there and the regular can, can, can lean in"
"14011650","14014670"," and tell me if I'm right or wrong on this heading into the next week."
"14014890","14020110"," Maybe when you guys can, uh, jump in the chat and tell me what your thoughts are here because we're"
"14020110","14021070"," kind of right in the middle here. "
"14021370","14023170"," It's kind of like a wet dream for a theta gang."
"14023690","14026110"," I think this is a wet dream right here for theta gang."
"14030550","14032130"," Uh, so there you go for next week. "
"14032990","14037410"," Uh, you can, if you're looking for something to sell or buy, it's on the high, it already took"
"14037410","14038870"," place on the 22nd."
"14039310","14040870"," Sellers came in and sold down below."
"14041650","14047090"," Uh, if you're looking for a dip to buy, bull's probably hoping that we got down here to 382 so"
"14047090","14050790"," they could buy this dip up into at least, uh, o-packs, but right in the middle right now. "
"14051870","14052510"," Come on here."
"14053830","14054690"," Didn't blow it up."
"14058050","14058970"," Play the music. "
"14060110","14063390"," I got, play the music text from like three people today."
"14063890","14067730"," Uh, so just right here, and you see the bear playing here."
"14068330","14073270"," Uh, but there's also squeeze, squeeze potential here because squeeze up in a Friday for more, like"
"14073270","14076550"," if more sellers want to come in, we squeeze up in here and then they just come in and try"
"14076550","14080590"," to like at least sell this down into, this is a beautiful trade right here, right?"
"14080710","14081970"," Into, um, next week. "
"14082170","14084350"," So if you're a bear, you might, you know what?"
"14084430","14086950"," I'll be honest, if you're a bear, you probably want to see a squeeze today."
"14087230","14090950"," Unless you, unless you took this short above at four, zero, four, six."
"14092070","14094210"," I don't, you probably took profit here already. "
"14094790","14099170"," Uh, there's probably another entry for you above into Friday."
"14100090","14101810"," Uh, at least on SPX, okay?"
"14103670","14105590"," Uh, let me know in the chat a couple things."
"14105810","14109210"," Let me know in the chat if you think, oh, dude, are we squeezing again?"
"14109670","14110070"," Hell yeah. "
"14112110","14113950"," We back to squeezing again in the bell."
"14115630","14118470"," Look at that retest on the five minute head and higher."
"14119990","14121850"," Um, yes, that's my take. "
"14122010","14126730"," My take is, if you're, if you're already closed out your shorts or you took the profit and ran this"
"14126730","14132350"," morning, uh, your bear, some bears are probably out there looking for a better high to sell off of,"
"14132510","14133130"," the tee off of."
"14133630","14135050"," Hopefully we get that on the close."
"14135410","14140650"," I'll tell you this, if we trade up here, anywhere up here into this close, I'll probably be looking"
"14140650","14142490"," for a put spread into next Friday. "
"14143810","14146230"," So kind of an easy put spread that I just hold on to in the next week."
"14148030","14150670"," This might even be your only chance right here in this daily trigger."
"14152490","14155710"," Not the hourly, excuse me, this is the hourly trigger, but you get the hourly and the daily to look"
"14155710","14160510"," at somewhere up in here into this close, not a position into next week. "
"14161110","14166570"," Now as far as, uh, what my thoughts are in the next quarter, I laid that all that out, I"
"14166570","14168190"," laid all that out earlier in the broadcast."
"14168870","14174430"," What my take is in the market, um, into quarter end, not quarter, but next quarter."
"14174470","14176570"," But it's all data dependence on next week. "
"14177230","14181690"," You know, I'm not going to say to you, uh, you have, I see like JPM come out with like"
"14181690","14191230"," a, like a 460 or 4600, uh, high side call spread and they've got like 3800 as their low side."
"14191990","14193470"," You know what we're going to be doing, right?"
"14193910","14197150"," And you probably see a reaction of the market on Friday to some shit like that."
"14197750","14202090"," We probably actually get out and hit 3800 first, then go up there, but you know, this is all"
"14202090","14206850"," dependence upon, uh, how we close the month, the price that we close the month is important. "
"14210650","14216760"," I don't know what is going on with this, uh, there we go."
"14217880","14219320"," All right, there we go."
"14222420","14225900"," And I'll be honest with, if you're a trader out there, if you're an investor out there, a trader"
"14225900","14229540"," out there, this does me no good, right?"
"14229720","14230900"," You guys won't show up next week. "
"14231080","14233940"," But if you were to take a week, I wouldn't blame you next week."
"14234220","14234720"," I really wouldn't."
"14241320","14244460"," I'm reading that, Johnny, Johnny, John Haggard. "
"14244520","14245640"," I'm reading your text right now, brother."
"14249350","14256610"," So, you know, like into next week, you could position yourself for the week, but not day, train it."
"14256710","14260490"," I mean, you can day trade it, but you could position yourself for an easy week next week. "
"14261230","14265970"," And then you're basically just consuming data, talking to people on social media, talking to people"
"14265970","14271690"," with Discord, finding out what their takes are on their positioning for the next quarter, and wait"
"14271690","14274030"," what they think is going to happen."
"14276010","14282130"," I would, as of right now, as of right now into into next quarter, what I would say to you"
"14282130","14288410"," is, I'm at this point likely going to be positioned unless something changes."
"14289490","14296330"," For a strong Q2 with some risk of failure in the market. "
"14297530","14300430"," Some kind of risk of failure that we don't know about or don't see."
"14301290","14307270"," So be a pro, I'll be appropriately hedged for that stuff with some size, cheap stuff, but needless"
"14307270","14312270"," to say, some kind of ratio spread of some kind for the quarter."
"14312690","14316030"," I'll probably place on at some point on Friday. "
"14316850","14325440"," Yeah, you know, I didn't even think about that."
"14325560","14327540"," There's a bunch of what we should talk about that stuff too."
"14327760","14329440"," So if I'm missing something, let me know. "
"14330000","14332020"," But we do have some volatility, right?"
"14332280","14336360"," We've got a debt limit ceiling in Q2, Q2, we've got debt limit ceiling."
"14337720","14347420"," So try to pair that up with that volatility up with whatever the Lowe's are planned for their"
"14347420","14347720"," caller."
"14350680","14352180"," What else did someone post in here?"
"14353680","14368490"," They said, yeah, if"
"14368490","14371410"," you like trading ranges right now, we're in a low on breadth. "
"14371930","14377250"," So everything says up, everything says up in this market for the next quarter."
"14380570","14390460"," Yeah, you know my take on"
"14390460","14392060"," tech, I think it's going to remain strong."
"14393260","14395420"," But there's some unknown stuff, right?"
"14395420","14400660"," We've got commercial real estate is looking really sketchy. "
"14402240","14403740"," Really, really sketchy."
"14404640","14407740"," I'm going to expect that to be a vol moment in Q2."
"14409520","14411560"," I'm going to expect that to coincide. "
"14412600","14413260"," And then we've got the minutes."
"14413840","14415020"," We usually sell the minutes."
"14416060","14416920"," We usually buy the meeting. "
"14418520","14419940"," So plan accordingly with that stuff."
"14422300","14423980"," We've got the debt ceiling limit, right?"
"14423980","14424660"," Debt limit ceiling."
"14426680","14429360"," Anybody else have any vol events that are known coming down the road?"
"14429740","14431060"," Like real ones, ones we know?"
"14446270","14447190"," Yeah, man. "
"14447870","14449610"," There's definitely a bailout coming."
"14450010","14452090"," There's a guy on Fintuit that I follow."
"14452510","14456050"," He's been following him for a few years. "
"14456670","14466650"," He's a Canadian real estate commercial, real estate commercial, and this guy"
"14466650","14468290"," has been on point for a couple of years."
"14468470","14469190"," This guy hasn't missed."
"14469450","14472590"," He's like, they're not doing this and they're going to do that. "
"14472730","14473350"," They're not doing this."
"14473890","14474850"," And this guy's a Canadian."
"14475730","14477670"," And he's been nailing it for a couple of years. "
"14477830","14478410"," I forget his name."
"14479210","14479930"," Older guy."
"14481610","14483730"," Not an old guy, but kind of like middle aged. "
"14495210","14496830"," Yeah, male pecs in June quarterly."
"14497570","14499410"," Yeah, that's what we're talking about right now, right?"
"14499570","14500910"," Is the quarterly opecs in June."
"14511150","14514150"," We talked earlier this morning too, and I want you guys over the weekend. "
"14514850","14519330"," If you guys are serious about this as being a profession for yourself, if you take this shit"
"14519330","14523650"," seriously, I want you to get on that stock charts.com website."
"14524490","14525510"," I want you to look at that."
"14525770","14526850"," What I told you was Google search. "
"14527170","14529010"," What did I say it was a sector."
"14529750","14532210"," Here, what I said, I said a sector rotation."
"14534050","14537590"," I forget what I said, you have to go back to the video and find it, but I'll try to"
"14537590","14539290"," post it if I remember inside the discord. "
"14540070","14541530"," You guys need to discuss that stuff."
"14541910","14546970"," I want you guys to understand the complexity of and what signs to be looking for, right?"
"14548090","14550050"," Like, why was I bearish on oil?"
"14551770","14552270"," Right?"
"14552430","14554250"," I'm like looking for signs of the market."
"14554450","14561750"," Where is it on sector rotation in terms of business cycles, right?"
"14562010","14563970"," So that you guys are all on point with that stuff. "
"14564810","14567350"," And if you disagree, I understand that you disagree too."
"14567350","14570010"," You don't like to take what I say as gospel."
"14571430","14576590"," And I like when there's contra or counter arguments against me. "
"14577290","14583330"," So don't like listen to what I say and say that what Cap's saying is the spoken word of truth."
"14584390","14588030"," Make sure you go into people that realize what people are providing you."
"14588150","14592250"," Some people provide you with data, some people provide you with news, some people provide you with"
"14592250","14597630"," their opinions, some people provide you with their positioning for this stuff, right?"
"14597730","14598770"," And wait all that stuff together. "
"14599050","14602330"," And then the last thing I would say to you was consult a financial advisor."
"14608610","14610730"," Yeah, it's a sector cycle stock market."
"14613680","14614380"," Thanks, Rowlett. "
"14624510","14626210"," Yeah, I remember what we talked about this morning."
"14626430","14627710"," What will actually be bullish?"
"14628230","14632110"," What's your best bet to make profit on?"
"14632350","14633690"," What are you buying dips on?"
"14633930","14634970"," What are you selling rips on?"
"14635490","14636410"," All that stuff is important."
"14637990","14643810"," Are we going to see continuation of consolidation in finance as a question mark?"
"14644070","14645490"," But historically, we know what it is. "
"14646070","14648750"," Now to come back up to retest that early trigger again."
"14649510","14650810"," More probing going on above."
"14655090","14656570"," Yeah, I think you can stay bearish. "
"14656730","14662630"," I think what you do, I think if you are, I think right now if you are a serious investor"
"14662630","14668390"," and trader that you're looking for another place to knock down the market."
"14669010","14674310"," Into next week, probably looking for some place to knock down the market today or tomorrow."
"14675110","14681190"," And I would be sitting on my hands if I was a bull or a bear and spend next week"
"14681190","14682750"," consuming what's out there. "
"14682850","14689750"," Matter of fact, we should probably donate a portion of our each day next week into discussing"
"14690690","14693750"," what's being discussed out there for the week."
"14693750","14699110"," So like donate a part of our day to, if we have a nice slow day or sideways action of"
"14699110","14701930"," the market, maybe we follow what the news is saying more closely."
"14703170","14705230"," Consume of what's somewhat on fin to it. "
"14706410","14711210"," And try to have some discussions inside the stream for positioning."
"14711210","14713030"," Because this is some serious shit, right?"
"14714390","14715850"," Into the next quarter, right?"
"14716030","14719390"," I don't want to be positioned wrong or not protected and you don't want to be either."
"14721170","14727730"," So probably instead of maybe making money every day, all times every day, day trading, we'll just"
"14727730","14734030"," at least try to get a handle on some, like a baseline. "
"14734530","14738890"," Oftentimes in this stream, I feel like we're all on different pages."
"14739530","14744750"," Even if we disagree, but to have like a baseline, hey, let's talk about this over this next"
"14744750","14745170"," quarter."
"14746150","14748050"," Let's revisit this over the next quarter, right?"
"14748050","14757390"," Now we talk about things each quarter and they like grow as the quarter goes on, right?"
"14758070","14760950"," Whether they're proven or disproven or they're broken. "
"14762170","14767350"," Did anybody expect the regional bank crisis a week ago?"
"14767770","14768970"," You guys remember, right?"
"14769110","14770990"," It was like a Thursday or something, Wednesday or Thursday."
"14771850","14774870"," And we're all like, what the fuck is going on here?"
"14775290","14776610"," I don't think it mattered if you're a bull or a bear."
"14776610","14781490"," By that Tuesday, it had been like everybody traded through the weekend, even though they didn't. "
"14781890","14786190"," Like, it's like we did five straight days, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, went right into"
"14786190","14788450"," Monday and Tuesday and it felt like a week had passed."
"14790210","14795530"," Squeeze and I are to close those gaps above at 394, 36, 394, 50."
"14803620","14807240"," Yeah, Uncle JBJ is saying that I'd never heard of SBB. "
"14808300","14810140"," And that led into a silver gate, right?"
"14810420","14811280"," It started with silver gate."
"14812020","14817040"," We did a program, do you guys remember any of the people that are here every day?"
"14817740","14823900"," I did a program on Silver Gate and had Quinn on and Quinn and I are in here talking and"
"14823900","14830280"," whenever we had a conversation and we had an interview and before anything had started to leak into"
"14830280","14835160"," other parts of liquidity, right?"
"14835380","14837820"," And we're like, hey, does this have any, do you remember in that stream?"
"14838160","14840760"," That stream is inside of YouTube."
"14841240","14846700"," You can find it and we did a discussion and we, and what was the, what was the last question"
"14846700","14847440"," that I had for them?"
"14848760","14852660"," And I said, is there any risk to the greater market?"
"14852880","14854440"," Is there any risk to the banking system?"
"14855380","14859220"," We talked about that before, a week or two before it happened, right?"
"14860140","14860960"," Do we see anything?"
"14861360","14866820"," Is there anything that anybody sees out there and nobody publicly at least was willing to admit"
"14866820","14872200"," that there was a panic out there, right?"
"14873000","14878180"," But there was panic and then it was bleeding into low and behold VCs, right?"
"14878320","14883940"," VCs are using crypto and it's bleeding off into regional and crypto banks and they're not telling"
"14883940","14885920"," you they're panicking but they are behind the scenes. "
"14890470","14891670"," You guys get what I'm saying?"
"14893650","14899790"," So maybe we'll spend some time next week as the quarter tweez and I are now not trying to form"
"14900310","14906310"," the more time we spend here, we've got the one in the five minutes, the white and red line are"
"14906310","14907170"," making their way up."
"14907170","14913210"," We now have a cluster forming on the hourly and on the five minute and the one minute."
"14913390","14922930"," So you go three trigger cluster and the more time we spend here, the more you start to melt"
"14922930","14928450"," up, believe it or not, at the worst case, melt up into that daily trigger. "
"14929370","14931270"," You can see the supply zones above us."
"14932630","14934130"," So yeah, maybe next week, that's what we do."
"14934970","14935770"," Take everybody's input. "
"14936390","14939950"," Listen to Winky, one of our best stock traders."
"14940850","14948770"," He's one of our best stock traders and Winky takes very seriously his positioning into each"
"14948770","14949050"," quarter."
"14949850","14953170"," I mean, this for what his positioning is. "
"14953510","14961230"," John Haggerty is a big time swing trader and he takes very seriously what he's swinging for the"
"14961230","14961670"," next quarter."
"14963030","14965110"," There's all kinds of people in here, right?"
"14965210","14969370"," I'm not listing everybody but there are people who take this shit absolutely seriously."
"14970190","14975530"," They have real large money on the line so we should probably dedicate next week. "
"14976090","14980970"," Maybe we can Winky to spend in half an hour or something on the show talking with."
"14981090","14985230"," Maybe we can schedule him on the show if he has some free time available next week."
"14986630","14987530"," We'll talk to Winky. "
"14987630","14991410"," Maybe we can have John Haggerty on for half an hour an hour and see what his thoughts are."
"14991550","14993990"," Maybe we can get my Mero in here one day next week too."
"14994470","14998590"," I'll talk to Chaz and see if he can coordinate or Binky. "
"14998830","15004150"," See if Binky or Chaz can coordinate having those three on at some point next week and see what"
"15004150","15006270"," their thoughts are on next quarter."
"15026340","15027860"," Vic's selling off right now."
"15030100","15032080"," Vic's just grinding lower right now. "
"15033760","15034940"," Vic's looks right now."
"15035300","15036780"," Vic's is very bearish right now."
"15037220","15037980"," Just heads up to you. "
"15038260","15039180"," Vic's is very bearish."
