"L2ciyhZCwrM","0","9280"," Hey, traders, Kevin Jim James here with your daily brief for the week of August 23, 2021."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","9280","13360"," We are going to get started right away with the economic calendar that's upcoming for"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","13360","14360"," this week."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","14360","20240"," We have PMI numbers coming out on Monday, new home sales on Tuesday, durable goods on"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","20240","21240"," Wednesday."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","21240","26560"," And then we've got good old initial claims and continuing claims coming out on Thursday"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","26560","27560"," over here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","27560","31880"," And on Friday, we've got a whole bunch of inflation stuff, personal income, consumer"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","31880","37440"," spending, the PCE, and then we've got the consumer sentiment index out of the University"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","37440","38440"," of Michigan."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","38440","45120"," All of this lines up with the Jackson Hole Symposium that begins on Thursday, Friday,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","45120","47720"," to lead into a lot of volatility this week."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","47720","51000"," The volatility gang is kind of banking on this."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","51000","56360"," We did have some other news come out towards the end of last weekend over the weekend that's"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","56440","61120"," putting a slight damper on this volatility that we're expecting, and especially on the"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","61120","63960"," plans of dumping this market completely."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","63960","68720"," The one thing I want to talk about quickly is if you're a new trader, seasonally, this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","68720","72240"," is when we start to close our long positions."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","72240","77560"," We start taking longs in March and May, and we hold them through the summer months into"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","77560","80120"," the end of August and September."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","80120","81880"," We start to de-risk."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","81880","84280"," So you're going to hear two things happening."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","84440","89120"," First, the bears have to be right at least once a year, if not twice."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","89120","93040"," So they are going to start to talk about market, doom and gloom."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","93040","98440"," They're going to talk about how this is the top and how we're going to have, I don't"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","98440","101600"," know, the face ripping, Armageddon."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","101600","104680"," You'll hear that every single year right around this time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","104680","106240"," So they have to be right."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","106240","110680"," They'll say this is what proves that I'm right, and then you'll fall into the bear trap of"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","110680","112760"," we're going to decline further."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","112800","117800"," Now, you'll also start to hear bull saying, is this a bull trap?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","117800","123960"," And the reason you're hearing that is because longtime investors want the market to go"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","123960","124960"," down."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","124960","131600"," So we've always spoken here about de-risking ourselves from the market at this point."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","131600","137360"," You should have no more long stock positions than big tech and companies like that that"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","137360","142680"," have gone up all year long, especially companies that have gone up all year long."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","143640","147560"," So if you are still in those positions, I don't know what to say to you at this point."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","147560","149800"," I got nothing else to say to you."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","149800","157880"," Even myself, it would be nice to see tapering rate increases coupled with a seasonal decline"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","157880","160680"," in the market so we can wrap them both up at once."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","160680","165840"," We won't get a Black Swan event next year or the year after so that we can buy cheap"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","165840","168440"," and go long once again, once spring comes."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","168440","172160"," So I think that's what the bull trap might be talked might be about."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","172160","173160"," That's two-sided."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","173160","177160"," You've got bulls that want the market to go down and you've got bears that want the market"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","177160","178160"," to go down."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","178160","180760"," Now, the only issue in this is timing."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","180760","185560"," The banks, the institutions do not want you to make money."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","185560","187920"," They want themselves to make money."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","187920","192080"," So if you're a bear, you have to time the market to climb."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","192080","193640"," Does it happen all at once?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","193640","194640"," Probably not."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","194640","200480"," Will they have moments where it springs back up to catch people wanting to go long?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","200480","206000"," And also, is there money to be made in there or do people not get the gains they were"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","206000","207000"," promised?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","207000","211560"," So if you were a long apple and you said, I left too early, I went up to 170."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","211560","215200"," There was still too much risk for you to hold into 170."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","215200","217840"," The prudent thing to do would be to sell out of that position."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","217840","224200"," Well, that doesn't mean you can't play the runs between now and when the market actually"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","224200","228760"," declines and that will lead us into some other talk."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","228760","235440"," You know about Kaplan coming out and saying that he was open to more quantitative easing."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","235440","238800"," This isn't good for the bear narrative."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","238800","244000"," And especially if bears are short, let's say they've been short for the past month or so,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","244000","251080"," we might go another month with the market being up and that could destroy positions for bears."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","251080","254360"," And that also gives money to the market makers, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","254360","257520"," It feeds another run up to the last of the bulls that are in the market."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","257560","260400"," So you have to consider these things as we move forward."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","260400","266800"," We also have Yellen coming out and stating that she backs reappointing Chair Powell in"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","266800","269040"," February for another term."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","269040","274680"," This does not bode well for any bear or bull that wants to see or any bull that wants"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","274680","280320"," to see a market decline with tapering and rate increases now."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","280320","286280"," This actually furthers the bear case that we could go into the stratiferic numbers in"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","286280","291760"," the future, setting us up for some sort of a black swan event that actually proves"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","291760","298200"," the bear thesis if we continue to go up or don't have both moves at the same time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","298200","301040"," Now you may ask why are they doing this?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","301040","305400"," You know, shed fair Powell, he wants to leave on a good note."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","305400","311800"," Let's say we even get tapering or rate increases, you probably wouldn't get them until he's"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","311800","316600"," leaving office and the next president or next chair is saying, hey, I'm going to deal"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","316600","318040"," with this mess, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","318040","320600"," So Chair Powell leaves when everything is great."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","320600","325400"," The next guy comes in knowing that everything is shit and then he or she gets to look great"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","325400","326560"," down the road."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","326560","328960"," So you have everybody with a great legacy."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","328960","333640"," No one wants to be the chair if they're going to get thrown under a fucking bus."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","333640","339480"," So these are not good signs for anyone that is de-risking and wants to get long in spring"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","339480","340480"," time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","340480","346600"," All the longs want to get out of this market and want to get deep discounts on pricing"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","346600","347600"," in spring time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","347600","351800"," So we have to consider this news as well as we head into the seasonally down time of"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","351800","353400"," the year."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","353400","355960"," Now nothing has changed."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","355960","364520"," I did these charts, the RUT, ES, and NQ, I pre-made today because I have to go into"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","364520","367880"," a thing that we're launching, we're going to try to turn a hundred bucks into a hundred"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","367880","368880"," keg."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","368880","371480"," I'm going to keep this quick in the indexes."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","371480","376800"," Literally nothing has changed and since every video I've made in the past two weeks, it's"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","376800","378240"," all come true."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","378240","380080"," So here we are."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","380080","384760"," We already know that we're playing within this red and white triangle right here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","384760","388760"," I've actually color-coded this stuff today to make things kind of easy."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","388760","390960"," You know, we're playing within this triangle right here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","390960","393560"," We know that there's high demand down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","393560","402400"," We are expecting IWM to sell off first and IWM can sell off before the decline of spy"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","402400","403400"," and NQ."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","403400","405680"," Be aware of that as we move forward."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","405680","408680"," If you're taking, this is an easy place to take a short, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","408680","413680"," You take this short down, you always want to be closing your shorts or closing your puts"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","413680","418840"," that you've purchased and waiting for further confirmation for legs down."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","418840","422360"," Now if you play futures, yeah, you can grab your short."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","422360","427600"," You can grab short up here, but if you're in cash market, you're not going to be buying"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","427600","432800"," and holding your puts over through this red line until you get confirmation."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","432800","438440"," You have to allow the market to take breathers as we make further declines."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","438440","444440"," It was not really that unexpected that we were going to find a bounce on Friday."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","444440","449200"," Now with this news that's telling us, oh, there's still hope, you'll probably hear"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","449200","452720"," news like this as we move forward down the line."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","452720","457720"," I would expect it to go down, come up, go down, come up and go down."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","457720","463440"," So you have to kind of keep these things in mind with your trading strategy and exactly"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","463440","466000"," what you're buying and how long you're holding for, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","466000","470520"," The risk that's involved, how long you're going to hold them for for those kind of things"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","470520","471760"," to print."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","471760","474880"," So I made this line here in yellow and this line in blue."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","474880","481360"," I am bullish above and I am bearish below this red line here for further market decline."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","481360","483720"," And this should work for you for this entire week."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","483720","488400"," And we can take a closer look here, let me see if I can get a little bit closer here to"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","488400","491400"," give you an idea of what we're looking at."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","491400","496000"," So we're looking for bearish below 2082."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","496000","501920"," We're looking believe it or not for bullish above 2173 to bounce yet again off of this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","501920","504720"," hard resistance at 2220."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","504720","510760"," Now we could even possibly trade above this so that when the banks are ready to get short,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","510760","512800"," they get a better position."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","512800","517600"," Start to think about who's running the show here and retail not running the show."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","517600","521200"," They really don't run the show in making profit."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","521200","528400"," I'm not bearish until we're below this number 211.1 or as time goes on and it increases."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","528400","531600"," And these are some hard resistance lines in here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","531600","535360"," And I'm looking for in futures and futures will tell you a little bit better on this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","535360","536360"," where we head."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","536360","540760"," But let's just say we gapped down in futures and still bounced off this line."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","540760","544720"," I'm going to look for demand down here to push this back up tomorrow."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","544720","549120"," Now if there's no demand and we keep selling down the moment we get trapped down below"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","549120","552280"," here, I'm going to start to take another short position."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","552280","559120"," If we bounce down here and come back up to this 2140 or 2146 and it doesn't make it above,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","559120","561200"," I'm going to try to go short coming down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","561200","564800"," But the same thing holds true moving up over here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","564800","570040"," Now some of you are trying to grab that holy grail where we dropped 20-30 points."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","570040","571520"," And I do get that."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","571520","576080"," You want to grab that long, that short that's going to come straight down here, it was right"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","576080","577080"," up here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","577080","582240"," So you should be looking forward again right up here once again until this box tightens"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","582240","587880"," and tightens because you'll start to get more panic as we travel down over time into this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","587880","589320"," zone down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","589320","595280"," You will eventually get people saying, shit, I have to sell my longs in whatever XYZ small"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","595280","597720"," cap that's been going up all year long."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","597720","601160"," Let's look at ES over here, I did the same thing down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","601160","604640"," This is all bare doom and gloom down here, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","604640","609280"," I'll put one more, I'll put one more bare doom and gloom so you don't actually wear"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","609280","611880"," to get bearish down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","611880","614600"," That's probably somewhere in here, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","614600","617960"," So we'll get a little bit closer in this chart that you know you have bears that are"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","617960","625000"," calling, this is 412, but they're probably calling for like 403-406 somewhere down deeper"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","625000","626680"," in here over time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","626680","628800"," Do I think we get down here right now?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","628800","629920"," I don't."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","629920","636880"," I think we might get down there in March if we start to taper and we start to raise rates."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","636880","641840"," But as long as that carrot is dangled, if the carrot is dangled about stimulus or no"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","641840","647920"," tapering or no rates being raised, you won't see this number and it'll raise higher."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","648400","653840"," Until they actually do it or even make a statement that's truly hawkish and they made"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","653840","659160"," a hawkish statement in the FOMC me a minute, but they rolled that back with their actions"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","659160","663960"," in the press releases that they had this past week."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","663960","666440"," You need to keep that in mind as we move forward."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","666440","671120"," You also need to keep in mind that this bid that we got into the market on Friday morning,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","671120","673680"," this was no small bid."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","673680","675120"," This was a big bid."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","675120","677520"," Does that mean that you go in and you buy spy here?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","677520","683960"," I'm not talking about calls or FDs or anything like that or spreads over time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","683960","684960"," Call spreads over time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","684960","690760"," I'm talking about, are you buying the actual spy share, a share of spy and saying it's"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","690760","691760"," going to go up."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","691760","696440"," It is going to go up over time, but no, we're going to have a market decline from now until"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","696440","697680"," March."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","697680","703200"," But the question is, how does that impact you right now when you're going short or buying"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","703240","707280"," puts and how does it impact you if you're taking longs here?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","707280","712320"," So we have to get a little bit closer here and start to think about what's happening."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","712320","716440"," So tomorrow you're looking for these two white lines right here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","716440","722600"," You're looking to go bullish above or bearish below, probably somewhere down here below"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","722600","724960"," this blue line or this white line."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","724960","730760"," Now, the reason I'm saying this is because if they're giving us a nod on Friday that"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","730760","735400"," we're going to take this market up for another two weeks or until the next OPEX,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","735400","740520"," right, they're going to want a liquidity grab down here to go longs with whoever bought"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","740520","741680"," down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","741680","747520"," So you will see them try to dump this to get us to shoot up into September one last time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","747520","750200"," What does that mean for you as a bear?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","750200","754960"," That means that yes, you should have sold out of your shorts or your puts down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","754960","760120"," You should wait for a top above to grab more to come back down to the next level as we"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","760120","762640"," decline over time."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","762640","766440"," Now futures tonight, we will have a weekend gap here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","766440","771800"," They're going to try to fill that gap above and there's a couple other gaps up in here"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","771800","775600"," they might try to fill at $44.75."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","775600","779640"," So if you're bearish, you're going to be looking to see what happens into the open, do we break"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","779640","782680"," above or we find some support down here?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","782680","784800"," And you know when support's coming in."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","784800","786400"," We talked about this last week."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","786760","793320"," Hey, if you see 8 million, if you see a couple 200,000 buys come in, but then you see 8 million,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","793320","801680"," which we saw down here on the 19th and we saw again down here on the 20th, you know that"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","801680","803240"," there's some pork growing."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","803240","808400"," If you see it go sideways over here with no volume, chances are we're going down."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","808400","814360"," But if you see that volume smack come in, 8 million, 20 million buys, we're not going"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","814360","815360"," down."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","815360","817400"," So what are the things you need to consider?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","817400","821040"," And everyone's saying this is looking bearish or like a bull trap."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","821040","825980"," I think it is a bull, I think it is a bull trap overall, but you have to play the market"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","825980","831160"," that's in front of you and you have to time when you go short once again."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","831160","836880"," And to think that you were supposed to go short down here is just pure fucking insanity, it's"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","836880","838440"," pure insanity."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","838440","841640"," To buy puts down here is pure fucking insanity."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","841640","848720"," They burned off like 80% of the value of monthly puts down here and this move here and"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","848720","854800"," then this move back up and down and here and back up here ended up just tearing through"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","854800","855800"," put positions."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","855800","859680"," So when you're listening these bears talk about the doom and gloom and the drop that's"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","859680","865000"," coming on Monday, that's because there are bears that are holding positions that are"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","865000","870760"," getting burned to the ground, if that makes any sense to you."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","870760","875160"," When people know that we're going down, there's not as much money to be made."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","875160","880600"," You want this to come back up to make bulls feel good about their positions to then buy"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","880600","882960"," cheap to go short again."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","882960","889000"," So keep that in mind as we move forward this week, I am bearish, I'm beginning to get bearish"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","889000","895040"," below this white line below four, three, four, five, I'll get short again and I am bullish"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","895040","900680"," about starting to get bullish above four, four, six, four, four, six and most definitely"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","900680","903680"," bullish above four, four, seven, five."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","903680","909320"," The key on Monday is to be looking for more follow through down here to go bullish and"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","909320","916080"," for a sell off down and below these not the or at least this white line down here or this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","916080","921120"," red line right here and this white line right here, four, three, four, four and four, three"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","921120","924600"," or four, three, seven, seven, somewhere in this area here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","924600","931680"," You want to see continued selling down here before taking a bearish position."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","931680","937560"," Then looking at NQ, same thing, none of this has changed, we've talked about them propping"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","937560","943560"," up NQ to keep spy up into the middle of September."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","943560","947920"," All of this is played out, these are the same, I rewrite these charts every day or every time"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","947920","951680"," I make a video and nothing has actually changed."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","951680","956960"," This was a great short down below here, but we did find some more demand down below."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","956960","962440"," We will put one more line in up here now that we know that we've got some demand down here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","962440","966480"," We've talked ad nauseum about the 14,800 level."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","966480","972880"," We've said again and again that we are not bearish until we are, we break below and hold"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","972880","980280"," below 14,800 and yet again we did not break down below and hold the came back up retested"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","980280","984800"," to 14,800, 61 and we screamed higher over here."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","984800","989960"," I do have some fear that this is where the bull trap is, that we're going to trade within"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","989960","994480"," this zone down here and break above and possibly much higher."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","994480","999960"," I think that all signs point to NQ going higher, I think this is where the trap is."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","999960","1004720"," You can play day trades in here and you're going to look in pre or in the futures tonight"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1004720","1010960"," to see where it comes, let's say it places itself down at 14,962 and to open, this could"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1010960","1017360"," still swing higher and you could also see it come up here to 15,159 in futures and then"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1017360","1021320"," sell off down trapping bears for one more push up."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1021320","1024040"," So this is a very dangerous time frame queue."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1024040","1027800"," So what would I would say about it, about the queues as I'm going to look to be bullish"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1027800","1035520"," above somewhere above 15,111 for continuation and I'm not bearish until we break below this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1035520","1037480"," 14,770."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1037480","1042880"," So you could day trade this entire area in here until you get confirmation to actually"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1042880","1051680"," take a long position going up or confirmation below to take a really heavy short into NQ."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1051680","1056160"," But this still fits the narrative that we're going to drag this thing out."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1056160","1059320"," They're going to make sure that they bleed every bear and they're going to make sure"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1059320","1066480"," they trap every bull before this market goes into a real decline."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1066480","1068560"," Now on to the good stuff."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1068560","1074600"," We're going to roll into a challenge that I wanted to start, which is how to turn $100"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1074600","1078280"," into $100,000 safely."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1078280","1082720"," And I know a lot of you guys are building your accounts and one of the best ways to"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1082720","1088240"," build accounts is to take risky trades that you can double, triple, quadruply your"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1088240","1089240"," money."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1089240","1093400"," I know that out there some people say when you're building an account that if you have"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1093400","1098440"," a job you'll just take a certain set amount of dollars each week and you'll let it ride."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1098440","1101840"," Now there's always a lot of risk in following that program."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1101840","1106280"," I've seen a lot of accounts get blown up trying to grow accounts that way."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1106280","1112800"," One of the safest ways that I've kept my accounts funded is through spreads, through"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1112800","1115640"," any kind of fatedgang strategy."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1115640","1121040"," When I make these risky trades, when I place these FD trades, they're risky."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1121040","1124280"," I lose money all the time playing these trades."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1124280","1129040"," And how I keep my account funded is typically through seasonality, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1129040","1134640"," When springtime comes I'll start getting long in the market and when my account starts"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1134640","1139520"," taking hits, be more conservative in the plays that I take, right?"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1139520","1144720"," And fatedgang makes money regardless of what bulls and bears make."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1144720","1149920"," They have data strategies really do help you keep your account funded."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1149920","1158760"," They are a slow way but a more or I shouldn't say that's the best way to grow your accounts."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1158760","1161120"," There's less risk associated with that."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1161120","1164920"," So we're going to take a look at 12 stocks and this leads me into this too."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1164920","1168840"," I showed all of you guys how to buy the fucking dip."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1168840","1177120"," I showed you guys how I've done multiple videos on individual shit meme stocks and why they're"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1177120","1179600"," going to continue to decline."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1179600","1185240"," I've never explained to you great stocks to buy that are on the rise."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1185240","1191920"," So if you want to trade easy and not always be looking for a dip to buy, there are stocks"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1191920","1198480"," out there that are trending up that are very easy to buy into on their way up."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1198480","1204400"," Typically they do have great PE's, their ER's are outstanding, they haven't gone full meme"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1204400","1208080"," yet and they haven't really been put in the public's radar yet."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1208080","1211640"," You've got banks that are buying into these companies and then eventually you'll hear"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1211640","1216560"," about them in the news after they've already gone up huge."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1216560","1220520"," So we're going to talk about these stocks and then we've already talked about signing"

"L2ciyhZCwrM","1290680","1294200"," Now I know you're not going to believe that but I'm going to show them to you."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1294200","1298280"," I've already charted out coin here, I should have deleted this, I thought I had deleted"

"L2ciyhZCwrM","1300560","1308000"," So you know you've got from May until August 19th you've got a trend, an upward trend for"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1308000","1309000"," coin."

"L2ciyhZCwrM","1314880","1319320"," there is a line of demand down here for coin to go up."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1319320","1324120"," All these companies in this list, IPO'd within the past three years, they didn't have"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1324120","1330440"," crazy IPOs that made the stock overvalued, their PE ratios are all, they're trading"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1330440","1335840"," Webull with their PE ratios and their ERs have been outstanding."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1335840","1341160"," I implore you to do your own due diligence, trading these stocks as always."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1341160","1346400"," This is not a recommendation for trading and financial advice but if you check these stocks"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1346400","1351480"," out, these are some big boys that are under most people's radar."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1351480","1356040"," There's a couple that people know about but I'm going to tell you that at least eight"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1356040","1360640"," to ten of these no one is trading and no one is watching and eventually you're going to"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1360640","1365280"," hear news about how you should buy these stocks when they're already overvalued."
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1365280","1371240"," I did some basic support and resistance lines here, these are easy entry and exit points,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1371240","1376840"," you know we're trending up in coin, we know that the chance of coin coming down is not"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1376840","1382680"," that risky right now, we're also going to look at bill.com and initially when you look"

"L2ciyhZCwrM","1426680","1432280"," so let's say you picked up bill.com and it trades out of its range, you'd sell here"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1432280","1438000"," and wait for one big dip down below, now if it stays trading within this trading range"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1438000","1443240"," here right, we're looking for it to come back down, set an alert on your favorite charting"

"L2ciyhZCwrM","1764320","1771760"," little bit of consolidation, but we took this nice move above right here, so we're not going to"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1771760","1776480"," stay down here any longer, the question is where do we stay, we had a little bit more"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1776480","1785520"," consolidation and a peak above, so we're going to be buying anything below, below where we're at"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1785520","1793440"," 6903, any drops below 6903, you've got all these banks that did all this hard work for you,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1793440","1798800"," this stock is going up, let's get closer in this one, this is bullish here, this is all bullish"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1798800","1805040"," context, when you see moves up higher like this, this isn't a retail trader pushing this up,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1805040","1809920"," I'm going to check the chains on these two, the options chains, and see where everyone is long"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1809920","1816160"," in here, but if this gets any kind of dip down here, if we have a weak market in early September,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1816160","1821120"," this is all going to be huge buying opportunities coming up in the next couple of weeks, so apple"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1821120","1828080"," love it is on my radar, CFLT, same thing, you saw this same move down right, these are all"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1828080","1833440"," started to look familiar right, you see this huge move up, who do you think moved this stock up,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1833440","1840560"," do you think this was retail traders, this isn't, this is banks going long on these stocks, when you"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1840560","1847280"," start to see these banks going long on these stocks, they want to get prints off them, not 100%"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1847360","1854080"," prints, they want to get 300, 400% prints, so if you see this move up in here, this is 10 bucks,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1854080","1862000"," right, banks are all in right around 50, they want to get 100 bucks, they really do, they want to get"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1862000","1869600"," they want to get 75, 100, 150 dollars, in this beautiful consolidation in here, right, this does"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1869600","1875360"," not look bearish to me, this looks bearish to me, you can see the bearish move right, it played itself"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1875520","1884480"," nicely, eventually we jumped over, found support and started our run back up, you've got sellers"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1884480","1889600"," hiding up here, you've got maybe a few more sellers but they've been mostly been exhausted at this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1889600","1894640"," point, you're going to be looking for all time highs in this stock, if I can get any buy-ins down"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1894640","1900880"," below at 50 bucks, anything down here I'm going to buy them, and then we've got verb biotechnologies"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1901360","1907120"," another beautiful same pattern, right, do you think this was all retail traders? No,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1907120","1910400"," you've got to move up here, we'll show this move up,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1914960","1920640"," you've got to look for some more consolidation to see this nice sideways movement, then a boom move"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1920640","1926640"," up, and you're going to look for the same thing down in here, you want to look for some sort of"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1926640","1931920"," move down here, possibly lower, and we're going to grab some call spreads on this at some point,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1932720","1938000"," I'm going to add these every week, every week I should be able to come up with five to 10 of these"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1938880","1945520"," to be buying into, looking for strong moves up like this, these are great stocks to be getting"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1945520","1951360"," long in, especially on any pullbacks, and even if we only find one out of every 12,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1951760","1958240"," it's not going to matter, it really isn't going to matter, so we have the same move"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1959840","1967840"," over here with XM, you see this beautiful consolidation, right, this upward move, we came down"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1969840","1975520"," the same upward move, we came down, could possibly be another rounded top, and then another shoot"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1975520","1984960"," above, right, so we're going to look for some sort of consolidation phase"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1986640","1992560"," down in here, you see that nice consolidation phase, starting to come together for you,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1993440","1998880"," you see they moved it up once, twice, three times, they're telling you they want to be above,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","1998880","2004000"," anything below down here, we're going to buy a spread and go long on this, then we have agrify,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2004080","2011040"," same setups, none of these are all bullish stocks I'm showing you, all stocks no one wants to tell"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2011040","2016000"," you about, you can see that the move started somewhere down here around 12 bucks, they're all"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2016000","2021920"," on board somewhere up here at 26, they're looking to get some profit up in here, they've only made"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2021920","2028480"," so far 50%, so there's still a move left in this stock, we're going to look for a more support or"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2029440","2038160"," buyers down here to push this stock up to all time highs, live it, another beautiful stock,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2038160","2045920"," let's take a look at this one, bullish in context as well, this one's ready to make a move,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2046560","2052960"," see this nice big move up, we come down, shoot back up, you could also say oh we've got sellers"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2052960","2057040"," above, you have to really watch out for this area, this is really all you're looking for,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2058000","2063840"," you're just looking for this move above, one more drop and then a shot straight north, nothing"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2063840","2071280"," about this is bearish, none of this, they bought in at 17 bucks, they made a move up at 21, it took"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2071280","2076240"," some profit, came back down, they're going to try to hit it one more time for more profit,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2076240","2082640"," g-nog, let's take a look at this one, some of you guys know g-nog because of this move up, this was"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2082720","2090720"," not retail, this is because the banks know that it's going up, now oftentimes when we make these moves"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2090720","2101760"," up there will be a pullback, sometimes when we come up this fast right interest will leave"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2102400","2107760"," where people will take profit and we'll push back down, but we haven't seen that in g-nog and that"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2107760","2115200"," is a sign that they don't want it coming down, now if you're a bear you can play this for a buy"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2115200","2120480"," in for liquidity grab for the next move up, this is a possibility that you can play this down,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2121120","2128480"," now I'm going to set alerts at 1730 and 1583 for a giant move up on g-nog, so this one I'm watching"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2128480","2135280"," very closely because of the consolidation that's taking place here, you're not finding sellers on"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2135280","2139920"," g-nog, so I'm going to look again, set an alert here for anything below 1885,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2140960","2148000"," look for a buyer, buyer is definitely down below at 1728 or 1583, this one will be news dependent,"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2148000","2153440"," if you see negative news come out it might try to drop it to grab some liquidity and move this"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2153440","2159920"," stock up once again, that's all I've got for you, look forward to a play by tomorrow, we should start"
"L2ciyhZCwrM","2159920","2164960"," playing this game and we'll see if we can get 100 grand, hopefully we can get it before the"
