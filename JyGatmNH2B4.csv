"1740","2380"," Are we there?"
"2540","2920"," I think we're there."
"3960","5580"," Check won't be there yet. "
"12400","14040"," I've got a bunch of stuff that I've been here."
"19990","20390"," Check."
"34030","40440"," Check won't be there"
"40440","49480"," yet. "
"51110","62820"," Check won't be there"
"62820","62820"," yet."
"75360","78100"," Check won't be there yet."
"78100","80740"," Check won't be there"
"80740","90820"," yet. "

"182400","184420"," two and a three over here. "
"185400","189640"," There, there, there."
"190420","191920"," Good morning."
"192060","192860"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"193900","194460"," Welcome. "
"195960","199320"," Let me, I got a couple things I got to do here."
"199320","202420"," Here, live stream."
"203780","205840"," SPX Spy. "
"206640","209160"," Yes, yes, or hold on here."
"210160","211780"," Yes, then Q's."
"212580","213500"," Look at Tesla today. "
"214860","216620"," GME and AMC."
"216620","219920"," Oh, live stream."
"220920","222080"," See here. "
"223400","227120"," Then we've got a live stream up on this."
"237560","242760"," I need to start streaming on Twitter."
"243700","253640"," I wonder if, you know that we're supposed to start multi streaming and close that. "
"254680","256959"," Maybe that'll make Elon happy."
"259399","261600"," See if I can live stream up there."
"263100","265660"," Now, we've got a couple things to look at here. "
"266120","267180"," All this doom and gloom, right?"
"267460","269620"," Sell the news right on open here."
"271820","273180"," Let's take a look down here."
"273300","274460"," Look at that blasting down. "
"275740","276600"," Let's see here."
"278760","284960"," You know, 475 C's are still worth the ones for today are worth two dollars and 61 cents."
"285460","287140"," They probably opened this morning. "
"287460","291840"," I didn't look to see what they opened that should have, but I think that they're likely about three"
"291840","293700"," bucks or something like that in the open this morning."
"293700","297300"," So if you did hold calls into this morning, congratulations."
"299200","302400"," I got to put some levels in here for just a second. "
"303160","305660"," Well, we're going to talk about what to expect today."
"305980","313120"," Now, there should be some form of an unclenching of single ticker issues this morning."
"313380","323180"," So the idea here being you have a large amount of calls, some"
"323180","332460"," gamma and calls specifically that are on single tickers that are deep, deep, deep, deep in the"
"332460","332680"," money. "
"334580","340260"," And what's the effect here on our market?"
"341000","346140"," All these tickers were from Q4 in 2023."
"346600","352080"," That isn't all the call gamutants in the market, but on or on indexes, but on single issues,"
"352700","355220"," there's a ton of it rolling off today."
"355880","361340"," Now, I want to put a put spread on for the 31st. "
"361460","369640"," I thought the 30th, but yesterday, Andy Constand reached out and said, you want to own the vol into"
"369640","370960"," the actual 31st."
"371080","376300"," And so I think the point might have something to do with also have might have something to do with"
"376300","385560"," finding out or owning that ball, not necessarily through the event or through the"
"385560","391020"," event that's coming up on the end of the month, but riding into that event and getting rid of it"
"391020","392120"," before we get there."
"392360","397340"," So just accumulating that expected volatility into end of the month. "
"397520","404400"," Now, I don't know if that means I should be buying the VIX, possibly not a put spread, but it"
"404400","405120"," looks to me."
"405300","415080"," For me, from my perspective, I don't think basically early February."
"415760","416620"," That's my thesis. "
"416940","417680"," I'm sticking to it."
"418580","423140"," Now, I can't trade it with real money until I get some confirmation here."
"423320","427500"," So what am I looking for to place that trade?"
"428100","429840"," And right now we're on trend, right?"
"430000","430900"," This is the half hour trigger. "
"431500","432480"," This is the hourly trigger."
"433360","442620"," I can't take that trade with confidence unless price were to break below hourly trend"
"442620","447680"," and then confirm that we're reversing hourly trend."
"448140","452640"," So that would be what a break in price of the hourly trigger. "
"453480","458420"," I don't care how far down it goes, but I do care about the rejection above right here."
"459360","460360"," And then a new low."
"460800","465980"," So if that happens, if I can find that any kind of entry like this today, I will be Johnny"
"465980","468520"," on the spot with some put spreads. "
"468520","472440"," Now, I possibly could take them right here right now."
"472720","474620"," I was thinking about doing it just on the opening bell."
"474900","477240"," Be like, yeah, I'm where I am to get a pretty decent price. "
"477500","481820"," I can probably absorb a push even higher for that roll down anyways."
"482800","490120"," But you know, it being, being off X, I would not be shocked to see price go even up into"
"490120","490960"," the end of the day today."
"491260","492600"," Nothing would surprise me today. "
"493200","497380"," So my plan here is to either get some confirmation."
"498520","500360"," I can take that trade with confidence."
"501500","506820"," And if not, I'll be looking for some kind of high with some nice high on the rest of today. "
"506960","508940"," I mean, we do get the SPX all time high today."
"509760","510480"," That'd be kind of nice."
"511039","515760"," Matter of fact, that would be really nice for the idea of a roll down and then an even higher"
"515760","519880"," high in a week or two or a couple weeks. "
"521100","524600"," So we'll watch this and monitor this as it happens this morning."
"525320","527960"," I got to put change these levels up though quickly."
"528180","531140"," So, well, give me a few seconds here to just catch up. "
"532440","533960"," Is my stuff on this morning?"
"534380","534980"," Wait a minute here."
"535120","536240"," My voice sounds weird."
"536780","537740"," I'm losing my voice too. "
"542800","543760"," I wonder."
"545580","546020"," No, that's working."
"546780","546780"," Okay. "
"546780","546780"," Okay."
"550080","551440"," Give me one quick second here."
"555760","557700"," One quick second here. "
"559640","561380"," What am I looking for?"
"563180","564000"," There we go."
"565380","566560"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"567080","569380"," Are you all, let me ask you some questions out there."
"569540","573240"," What are you, what's your all position, position positioning into this morning?"
"573900","576000"," Are you looking to get long here this morning?"
"576260","580060"," Are you 475-32?"
"587000","589180"," Yeah, see, I'm feeling the same way about this. "
"591500","598680"," I'm just putting up the levels right now and I'm feeling the exact same way as the levels they're"
"598680","602800"," feeling here, which is there's your pivot, right?"
"603840","609160"," And I'm kind of looking for that below the pivot trade, right?"
"609960","613580"," I want to get underneath this pivot to place that trade."
"613940","616140"," So, until that happens, it's likely not going to."
"616480","622830"," 42, 42, 7."
"627140","638220"," Close enough for me, hand grenades and horseshoes, 479 "
"638220","639420","-96 for R2. "
"640140","642760"," And then R1 is 478-23."
"650060","651600"," So, there's your upside targets."
"652000","655080"," That's without STX cell or whatever that's supposed to be up there. "
"655720","657920"," And then, what do we got there?"
"659140","660600"," I guess we'll delete this one right here."
"662060","663520"," We have your pivot right here."
"663740","665260"," We're going to get underneath this pivot for sure. "
"665900","667740"," It's the plank here for bulls."
"668360","673740"," If we can get underneath this pivot and get some rejection going on, you guys see that right there,"
"673940","674000"," right?"
"674300","677740"," Something like that or I'll be able to drop better right here."
"677980","686160"," So, if I'm looking for something like this, a break of the hourly trigger, if that takes place, I'm"
"686160","689980"," then going to be looking for a retrace above and a rejection. "
"690860","695820"," If we can get below just this point right here, I am on that trade no matter what anyone out"
"695820","698360"," there is saying on FinTwit."
"698440","708220"," There's a lot of, there's a lot of, or in my view at least, there's a lot of, how should"
"708220","708700"," I say it?"
"708940","711160"," 7 or 473-59."
"719150","720790"," There's a lot of mixed messages. "
"721310","722430"," It's not just FinTwit either."
"722690","728710"," I saw some mixed messages on some of the news reporting that I saw yesterday."
"730070","740230"," It was all surrounding yield curve, rate cuts, what"
"740230","741170"," do rate cuts mean?"
"742530","748130"," I don't know if I, maybe I did post this two days ago, but if I didn't, I was going"
"748130","749210"," to post it, didn't. "
"749310","763080"," Maybe I didn't do it because I don't"
"763080","763680"," do it."
"764200","769560"," Someone made a great comment or a post yesterday about, we started the year with seven rate cuts."
"770040","771100"," Now we're down to like four. "
"772920","775400"," You know, and how quickly it changes, right?"
"777020","784620"," And, or your thesis or, you know, a few drop or a raise in price of SPX, how that impacts"
"784620","793960"," your, whether we're going to get rate cuts or rate, rate cuts, continue to pause or more rate"
"793960","794440"," increases."
"795040","800160"," And of course, you see the Fed in the little presidents, whether they're voting voters or non "
"800160","804460","-voters, you watch them and how they're acting."
"805520","812220"," And, you know, one day it's like, or even in the same interview, it is, well, I anticipate at least"
"812220","813420"," a few rate cuts this year. "
"813600","814580"," When do you anticipate them?"
"815740","818920"," No earlier than fall though, and it's data dependent."
"819800","820760"," It could be later."
"822280","826740"," Then the conversation continues and then about 10 minutes later, the little Fed president's like,"
"827120","834760"," well, we, you know, we could start cutting as soon as springtime, you know, so it's like, Neil's"
"834760","840020"," all over the place with the, of course, they're intentionally doing that, right?"
"842160","844860"," You got to soak up that soft landing time. "
"846060","854900"," It's like, we got a whole year here, and we're going to soak up our soft landing."
"855880","863000"," I think what is it that the actual soft landing periods last roughly one and a half years from the"
"863000","865280"," last rate hike somewhere in there."
"865320","868920"," Then there's a window in between that and the next recessionary period. "
"870720","872540"," So they're hamming it up right now in my view."
"872800","875560"," And I think some other people made some comments about that as well."
"879720","887900"," And I think Joe came out and said, you can stop using that word. "
"889600","890740"," What do they call it?"
"892920","894700"," Was it wasn't a transitory?"
"894980","897520"," I think it came out and said you can stop using the word transitory."
"898140","902300"," So now we're waiting for them to come out and say to one of the reporters, you can stop using"
"902300","903900"," the word soft landing."
"904520","905660"," It already happened, right?"
"910240","910640"," Right. "
"910780","911320"," Here we go."
"914630","915730"," Cues coming down to check."
"915890","918310"," It's a half an hour trigger and hourly trigger. "
"919370","927490"," Also another note here too, on your screen or down below here, we've hit our upside target"
"927490","927890"," yesterday."
"928930","934190"," And then we started to make a run for 4800 SPX."
"935110","943330"," And we also watched this right here, this candle yesterday on stream. "
"943370","945190"," We're watching this one right here."
"945630","949550"," And that one kind of gave us the indicator indication that we were going to blast up."
"950490","954610"," As soon as we slammed down here yesterday, I was like, oh, we're going all the way up, aren't we?"
"954870","964190"," And we tagged or we barely missed that gap, this gamma level by what?"
"966890","971610"," 4799.38. Geez. "
"972350","979570"," So we missed, we missed 4800 this morning by, you know, point one tick."
"979570","979630"," Okay."
"981610","991190"," And meanwhile, we've been like slow, like low grade edged or edging SPX"
"991190","998350"," for for an all time high on SPX for pretty long time now, right?"
"998710","1004750"," We've actually swung up there a couple times and rolled as well, trying to get that all time. "
"1004930","1005990"," It's like a tease."
"1007770","1010130"," But trust me, like I love SPX."
"1011030","1016950"," So there's like, I know there's a group of us out there on FinTwit that are have been watching this"
"1016950","1019510"," for months on end. "
"1019790","1022550"," Are we going to get the all time high or not on SPX?"
"1023730","1025810"," Looks like we're robbed of it this morning."
"1027250","1029050"," Yeah, I remember the transitory comments."
"1031490","1035210"," Everybody was like, transitory, transitory, not transitory, transitory. "
"1035810","1040329"," And then you're like, Jerome's like, okay, you can stop using it."
"1049000","1050240"," Okay, so that's done."
"1052020","1053680"," What else we got going on this morning?"
"1053800","1056260"," Let's see what else we, oh, dude, I didn't put the stream up, shoot. "
"1058120","1059660"," Hold on, I got to do the stream here."
"1059940","1065980"," I thought I posted the stream on FinTwit, but it looks like maybe I didn't."
"1066440","1067740"," Did I or did I not?"
"1071160","1072060"," No, I did post. "
"1072300","1072840"," Okay, cool, cool."
"1073120","1073760"," I did post it."
"1074580","1076660"," All right, close that right there. "
"1078220","1081340"," And we'll put CNBC live on in just a few moments."
"1082720","1087160"," Let me get some new levels here for SPX and see what it says."
"1087880","1089400"," Is anything magical going on?"
"1093050","1101470"," If anything has changed, it would be fascinating to to see the gamma picture next week. "
"1101490","1103850"," Doesn't look like anything's changed as of right now."
"1104210","1104930"," Oh, wait a minute."
"1105090","1105590"," Hold on here. "
"1107350","1113650"," Gamma flip is at 4760 on SPX."
"1114750","1122310"," So if you want to get really bearish where it's below the hourly and half hour, it's just above the"
"1122310","1125250"," hourly and half hour trigger on SPX."
"1125470","1126310"," So just be aware of that. "
"1129010","1137850"," And if you're looking to get bearish, you need to get underneath 4759 or 4760."
"1138230","1142810"," Let's just call it 4760 on SPX."
"1147690","1150770"," So 4760 is what we're looking for over there. "
"1151590","1158160"," That's three right there."
"1164860","1167120"," Yeah, SMCI, right?"
"1167560","1172200"," Did I see everybody talking about, so this morning I'm on social media and I'm like, oh, it's where"
"1172200","1174300"," Jonah's talking about SMCI."
"1174300","1178060"," A whole bunch of people out there talking about SMCI this morning. "
"1179440","1180700"," You want a quick second?"
"1180860","1181720"," I got some more stuff here."
"1182560","1183560"," Watch this here."
"1190220","1192160"," Goosell be saying what?"
"1192360","1194800"," The Fed is not facing an imminent threat from the labor market. "
"1195520","1199000"," If inflation progresses, I got to start back here with Gooseby."
"1199500","1200840"," I'm going to read you some stuff this morning."
"1201500","1203720"," Gooseby inflation data will dictate the rate path. "
"1204240","1204780"," Oh boy."
"1205320","1210380"," If we continue to make good progress and inflation, we need to factor that into policy rate."
"1211220","1211980"," Real restrictive. "
"1212380","1216680"," This matters to me as inflation comes down and opens the door for rate cuts."
"1217400","1217800"," Yep."
"1218260","1218640"," Yep. "
"1218780","1219100"," Absolutely."
"1219640","1222280"," Good price inflation back to normal levels."
"1222920","1227160"," There is surprising progress on services inflation as well. "
"1227440","1227960"," That's bullshit."
"1228640","1230880"," We need to see more progress and housing inflation."
"1231740","1235840"," That's not going to happen until 26 or shouldn't happen until 26. "
"1238000","1247020"," What else we got here from him or markets should be focusing on economic data."
"1247660","1249960"," Yeah, yeah, go on, go on."
"1253180","1256380"," If inflation reverses, could merit rate hikes?"
"1256680","1257260"," That's bullshit. "
"1257780","1259200"," Well, not."
"1259800","1266280"," So they should be saying if inflation, we should get rate hikes or pause or hikes."
"1266960","1272740"," But if we slam down into two percent, you're going to without a doubt, even if it's brief, you'll"
"1272740","1274480"," have the Fed come out and say mission accomplished. "
"1276480","1281500"," Now, if that we get that bounce off mission after mission accomplished, they are usually cutting as"
"1281500","1281740"," well."
"1283540","1286620"," The Fed is not facing an imminent threat from the labor market."
"1286620","1289960"," The next thing Goolsby said. "
"1290700","1293200"," That's all I got here in Goolsby this morning."
"1318660","1319900"," Yeah, I would not be."
"1320080","1321760"," Well, I could see someone taking it. "
"1322080","1322680"," So from"
"1322680","1346600"," my"
"1346600","1346600"," own perspective."
"1364240","1364660"," Hope not losing my stream here."
"1364660","1365300"," I'm not sure. "
"1365680","1366760"," I might be losing my stream here."
"1366900","1367240"," It's possible."
"1368020","1370860"," I've got some stormy weather coming through. "
"1370960","1373280"," We've had continuous snow the past three or four days."
"1373940","1378520"," I just had a reset on my one of my screeners here that was kind of wonky."
"1378660","1379400"," So just heads up. "
"1390520","1391940"," Yeah, I'm wondering right now."
"1392060","1393300"," Give me one quick second here."
"1402880","1404760"," Put around a speed test here in the background. "
"1425990","1427010"," It says I'm good."
"1427130","1431790"," It says I'm at a 500 normally because this is a plugged in."
"1431790","1432250"," Oh, there we go. "
"1432290","1432990"," I'm back up to six."
"1433890","1436030"," That's like 67680."
"1436950","1438170"," So I should be good to go. "
"1439330","1440410"," I should be a gig."
"1441690","1445970"," So 680 is not great, but it's not 100 megabytes."
"1446910","1448190"," Well, well, well. "
"1448570","1450230"," Tesla, Tesla, Tesla."
"1451870","1453970"," What's going on with Tesla this morning?"
"1461250","1464210"," Tesla with a five minute cross right now looking for a back check."
"1464510","1467130"," Let's think of a Tesla really quick and see if they can go up. "
"1468150","1470230"," First, we're going to stop in with Tesla this morning."
"1472270","1478220"," It looks like we have a one in five minute cross coming up here."
"1478380","1479600"," Oh boy. "
"1481240","1482000"," Here's Tesla."
"1484080","1485740"," Now we're not there yet."
"1486480","1487960"," We're going to talk Tesla here. "
"1488560","1496040"," You got shit tons in the money puts deep in the money puts on Tesla."
"1497300","1499340"," Now, do these get monetized?"
"1500320","1504420"," And once they get monetized, what happens?"
"1505940","1511100"," So you guys know that you guys want a simple way to think about this."
"1512760","1519760"," When hedging comes out of the market from banks, banks are tied to not disrupting the market. "
"1520460","1528500"," So what they'll do is they'll place a really bad trade or what looks like a negative trade that"
"1528500","1529520"," could impact the market."
"1529720","1535780"," So what the what these dealers do or that dealers these banks do is they will sometimes pad market"
"1535780","1542140"," with calls or puts to try to not disrupt the market."
"1542140","1551500"," But as the day wears on that gamma will roll off. "
"1552100","1558080"," And as soon as they've been crushed, let's say put on some bunch of zero day calls will swing"
"1558080","1559500"," higher than the end of the day."
"1560000","1564380"," They'll be like an impact towards the end of the day and the market will grow go up."
"1565240","1567720"," So I'm wondering about these putts, right?"
"1567920","1568840"," You don't always putts in the market. "
"1569100","1570180"," Well, what's going on right now?"
"1571040","1572140"," Something's going on right now."
"1572560","1574180"," You see that liquidity leave in the market here?"
"1575300","1576260"," Watch this right here."
"1578180","1579680"," It's watching this right now. "
"1581780","1583480"," Am I losing the power here?"
"1583620","1583920"," Internet?"
"1587710","1588650"," Something's going on."
"1592930","1594550"," This is news breaking."
"1594830","1604750"," We're actually going to have a 78.8, 78.8, high than 4.5,"
"1604910","1610010"," 72.1, existing home sales, 3.7, 8 million, 3.7, 8 million. "
"1610150","1610550"," That's right."
"1611130","1611910"," Pumping, baby."
"1612530","1618290"," Housing market should rip faces off for the for the next like year or two. "
"1618370","1619950"," It's really like a vertical straight line up."
"1619950","1620530"," 3%."
"1620530","1623950"," 1 year inflation, 3.1. So I'm going to try it. "
"1624390","1626350"," Housing is just like vertical right now."
"1626490","1628650"," Straight up vertical right now."
"1635030","1636330"," No, we're lower. "
"1636990","1637730"," Oh, I'm wrong."
"1638290","1644050"," Shit forecast was 3.8. They came in at 3.78. Well, maybe it's just Detroit that's happening in"
"1644050","1646290"," University of Michigan sentiment."
"1646290","1650590"," Preliminary 78.8 forecast 70.1. That's good. "
"1652730","1654750"," Although it's showing red on my side here."
"1654770","1657250"," I got two red boxes popping up right now."
"1671620","1673980"," Yeah, what's the deal with Dave Portnoy yesterday?"
"1674260","1675340"," I kind of missed all that. "
"1675800","1679400"," Does someone want to give me like a explain like I'm 5 on Dave Portnoy?"
"1680420","1682260"," People are getting saucy on him yesterday."
"1683460","1685300"," People are all over the place in their opinions too."
"1685300","1686660"," I don't know exactly what the story was. "
"1693990","1695110"," What else we got here?"
"1697670","1705830"," U.S. existing home sales actual 3.78 million forecast 3.83 million previous 3.82 What else do"
"1705830","1714470"," I got here?"
"1714690","1732680"," Another headline, University of Michigan Prelim actual 78.8 forecast 70.1 previous 69.7 Bond"
"1734250","1737230"," traders focusing on profit taking on steepers for now."
"1737710","1742450"," Bond curves are reversing their earlier steepening with new evidence suggesting that markets have"
"1742450","1750090"," overpriced the speed and depth of potential rate cuts bear flattening may gain momentum as"
"1750090","1751570"," investors take profits today."
"1757250","1758790"," So all right, so Tesla, right?"
"1759010","1761690"," We've got a bunch of puts rolling off Tesla today. "
"1761910","1767690"," So what you're looking for here is Mississippi, you know, but they don't really need to."
"1767810","1770910"," But what I really want you to see here, well, yeah, we can hold on a second here."
"1771330","1772130"," Let's go over there. "
"1773350","1775990"," So Tesla, okay, there's a one minute chart on Tesla."
"1776230","1777670"," What can you tell from this chart right here?"
"1778950","1783750"," You can tell that Tesla is just teeing off on the half hour one hour, right?"
"1784050","1784690"," BAM, there's one."
"1784990","1786690"," BAM, there's two BAM, there's three. "
"1787830","1792470"," So when I talk to you guys about confirmation, this is going down or up."
"1793950","1795970"," You can see this confirmation, right?"
"1796330","1798490"," To the downside, right?"
"1803850","1805810"," Same thing here, same thing here."
"1806250","1808810"," And this looks like the same thing right now on Tesla. "
"1809490","1814970"," So what I'd be looking for to take a long trade on Tesla would be for price."
"1816330","1818970"," So let's take a look at just this part of Tesla right here, okay?"
"1819050","1820190"," We got this previous eye here."
"1821470","1824370"," This tick was higher than this previous high right here. "
"1824410","1824770"," That's positive."
"1825090","1826230"," I'll give a check mark to that."
"1827890","1834290"," But I'm looking for some kind of a reversal above the hourly trigger, right?"
"1834490","1836630"," That would mean that we squeeze up higher. "
"1840920","1842960"," All right, maybe tag this one right here."
"1843060","1843880"," That'd be nice to see."
"1845820","1849760"," Right, then we come back down and this is where the key part is here. "
"1850920","1855500"," Coming back down and bouncing, right?"
"1856000","1856000"," Holding."
"1861030","1862690"," Come back down right there, right?"
"1863630","1867970"," And then watch some kind of a one in five minute turn above here."
"1870350","1871830"," Right, one minute's coming up. "
"1873310","1875350"," Have what looks like the demand up here."
"1875610","1876330"," Holding now."
"1878010","1879110"," This stuff, right?"
"1879630","1883710"," And then trying to get long here to make a trade to the upside. "
"1884350","1886410"," And what's that upside target up there?"
"1886550","1887110"," That's pretty big."
"1887810","1904680"," So we'll"
"1904680","1907480"," just keep watching this if this takes place at any point this morning."
"1908080","1910600"," We'll come back to Tesla and keep an eye on it. "
"1910960","1913200"," Until then, no trade."
"1913540","1919460"," No long trade on Tesla unless we start to break above and hold the hourly trigger."
"1920120","1923100"," If that does happen, it could be a nice race to the top. "
"1931750","1933090"," Sorry about that."
"1936570","1939230"," We're right back over here on spoos."
"1952940","1955040"," This is the pre-market. "
"1956100","1957080"," Let's see here."
"1959140","1961040"," No, they got that gap right there."
"1962860","1964140"," That gap is fine. "
"1964900","1966740"," There's a small gap right there."
"1966980","1967700"," Tiny a small."
"1968040","1969500"," I don't even see that gap right there. "
"1971300","1977880"," A tiny gap down there."
"1978780","1991390"," A little tiny"
"1991390","1992150"," gap down here."
"1998380","2000420"," Bork saying, I've got a flight to catch. "
"2000520","2001360"," I won't be around much today."
"2001760","2003000"," If I eye good luck on your trades."
"2003200","2003680"," Everyone happy Friday. "
"2003680","2004100"," Happy Friday."
"2004100","2005640"," Bork, titties brother."
"2011560","2013500"," Let's see what everybody's saying in the chat this morning. "
"2013620","2014500"," Let's say hello to everybody."
"2014920","2020100"," Morning, Hireshi, Andre, Andre, Adrian, Adrian, excuse me, B Frank 81."
"2020820","2021700"," Bliss, what's going on?"
"2021860","2022680"," Stacey, what's going on?"
"2024120","2025120"," Akshay, Patel, good morning. "
"2025480","2027140"," Nathan Dornmush, good morning."
"2027320","2027840"," Obie, good morning."
"2028320","2029180"," Kim, good morning. "
"2029240","2029900"," Sunday never ends."
"2029900","2039800"," Dragon Wolf, Hutch, Pepcat, Jack Baker, where we roam, will really want to"
"2039800","2041600"," take call spreads and tassel up to the DT."
"2041920","2043060"," Not sure if it's too early though. "
"2043220","2044620"," We've given an overall overall market."
"2045080","2047840"," Where we roam, we just went over, right?"
"2047940","2051420"," You can't take that trade unless you get above the hourly trigger with a back test, successful back"
"2051420","2051639"," test."
"2052139","2054199"," So do not take that trade unless we get above. "
"2058350","2062630"," Bliss would say, and I plan to take the money in my 40 season, the bell, but then they tanked"
"2062630","2062989"," in the open."
"2063150","2068870"," I'm still holding them and actually looking for a rip on data at 10 a.m. Sold out of SMCI"
"2068870","2069989"," called too early today."
"2070050","2070810"," Someone hold me. "
"2071969","2075070"," Dave Porty announced he was restarting his day trading stream."
"2075310","2078350"," Can you cope with the competition from his excellency?"
"2078590","2078889"," Oh shit."
"2079010","2081550"," I didn't know he was day trading live. "
"2083010","2086230"," What do you want me to say about Dave Portnoy, you made a comment."
"2086489","2090409"," I didn't know that that he was starting his day trading stream back up again."
"2091929","2093330"," What do I think about that?"
"2098090","2098910"," I'll be nice. "
"2099950","2100470"," How about that?"
"2104150","2105750"," I'm going to try to be a good guy."
"2106690","2108930"," I didn't know he was starting up his day trading stream."
"2111230","2112910"," What would I say to that?"
"2117460","2123200"," I'll just be, I prefer to say no comment because I don't want to disparage anyone. "
"2124140","2134000"," I'm most certainly not going to entertain what I've seen in the past from Davey Boy doing"
"2134000","2134340"," that."
"2137920","2138640"," Why is it?"
"2138740","2140460"," I guess why is he starting it back up?"
"2141320","2142340"," Let me know in the chat."
"2142500","2146700"," What are you guys thoughts on Dave Portnoy starting up his day trading again?"
"2148640","2150440"," You don't think you guys want my commentary?"
"2150600","2152420"," It's not nice either to disparage anybody. "
"2152700","2153480"," I won't say anything."
"2153620","2154220"," But how about you guys?"
"2154460","2157600"," You guys say whatever you want about that."
"2157960","2158560"," I didn't know that. "
"2159780","2165280"," I saw people talking about him yesterday and about some of the things about him."
"2165340","2170120"," I was like, but I wasn't piecing it all together that he was actually day trading live again."
"2170400","2171300"," But I didn't know that. "
"2172160","2173380"," What do I think about it?"
"2174440","2176660"," Let me ask you to find out what you guys are saying about it."
"2182040","2183920"," A guy just lost his stream in New York."
"2184620","2186820"," I had a brief interruption for a moment. "
"2189720","2191800"," We'll crash the comms grid."
"2193320","2196240"," Yeah, I'm with you on this Sunday Never Ends."
"2200990","2202750"," Yeah, I didn't know that about it. "
"2202830","2208910"," I saw the same stuff, but I didn't know exactly what was going on with the same stuff."
"2209050","2211150"," I did see the discussion about that."
"2212430","2213350"," You're out of those calls?"
"2216530","2221590"," Yeah, I don't like doing that because I don't want somebody doing it to me, right?"
"2223170","2224830"," You know, I would say this to you guys. "
"2225290","2226750"," I will say something about this."
"2228650","2230010"," I'll make a statement on it."
"2230790","2231550"," I'm not nobody. "
"2231750","2233470"," Nobody gives a fuck what I'm going to say, right?"
"2233870","2234950"," But I'm going to make a statement on it."
"2236470","2245050"," Because I have actually made a statement about this on Fintuit in the past on a similar side of"
"2245050","2245470"," this topic."
"2245670","2246450"," I'll say this to you. "
"2249590","2252870"," When we went through the COVID trade, right?"
"2253250","2257970"," I watched a lot of retail people."
"2257970","2262450"," A lot of people that never traded or invested in their lives come into the marketplace."
"2263570","2270510"," And the washout was epic. "
"2287690","2290550"," Now, the washout was epic."
"2291490","2296090"," There were moments on Fintuit where Fintuit grew really quiet."
"2297270","2304590"," As that washout progressed, it actually started in November, December of 2020. "
"2304590","2308030"," A lot of people think it started later, but it didn't."
"2308150","2309630"," People started getting washed out."
"2310590","2315070"," I remember at the end of the year, let me pause this for a minute here. "
"2316870","2319970"," I remember at the end of 2020, it was like November, December."
"2320910","2322250"," I was talking to Horace Lover-Fatt."
"2322430","2325350"," I think he had 500 subscribers, something like that. "
"2326050","2327650"," And he came from Wall Street Bets."
"2328210","2338070"," And we're chatting and we're talking about divesting of spec"
"2338070","2340370"," growth into the end of the year."
"2340730","2350690"," Focusing on the blue chips that still had a fucking"
"2350690","2354570"," bond, I think it was bad debt bond issuance or something like that. "
"2354730","2356930"," There was like a apple and a few others."
"2357590","2359830"," And the index is starting to shift into the indexes."
"2360850","2364730"," So then in 2021, we focused on blue chips. "
"2364730","2371330"," And then, of course, moved it right into when they eventually transitioned into just the indexes,"
"2371330","2374090"," trading just the indexes as legs were cut off."
"2374410","2384390"," But I do remember that November, December, CNBC for the new year was pumping, rolling your"
"2384390","2393490"," spec growth trade from, this is in December of 2020, rolling your spec growth trade into like ArcG"
"2393490","2394730"," and the like."
"2395770","2399770"," These smaller Arc ETF type spec growth stocks. "
"2400410","2406970"," One fact, what happened was they fucking sold into all these people into the end of the year of"
"2406970","2410090"," 2020, and then it progressed into 2021."
"2411770","2413970"," Progressively got worse and worse and worse and worse."
"2414370","2423650"," Now, at that time, or not that time, but down the road, and I believe later, later late 2022, after"
"2423650","2430170"," masses of people got washed out of the market, you'll see claims that people just had to go back to"
"2430170","2430390"," work. "
"2430870","2436690"," But the truth is, people got people got so lapped, new investors, new traders."
"2437670","2441490"," So just back when I'm trying to bring this back to Dave Portnoy."
"2441630","2451190"," So one of the things that frustrated me the most was that there are so many people that"
"2451190","2456450"," the tight gets that a new person in the market comes to the market and wants to trade their"
"2456450","2457450"," favorite ticker. "
"2458190","2464590"," Plot stocks, meme stocks, get back at demand stocks, whatever it is, whatever it's floating your"
"2464590","2470090"," boat, fucking silver because you think the world's going to end, whatever it is, whatever floats"
"2470090","2475630"," your boat, it's usually what makes, it's usually an emotional thing for a new investor or trader,"
"2476370","2476490"," right?"
"2477150","2481090"," So you have this huge influx, people are like, I fucking love this goddamn stock because I don't"
"2481090","2482170"," know, it's going to change the world."
"2482610","2485050"," And they have no idea that it's going blind, right?"
"2485310","2493090"," So when we started doing this here, we started what we're doing here because of that."
"2493690","2500990"," I noticed so frequently that people didn't have basic tools, basic, just basic fucking investment"
"2500990","2510210"," trading tools that they can apply to any stock or and to try to lure some of these people, believe"
"2510210","2516670"," it or not, over to the indexes so that they can learn how to trade something, invest in something"
"2516670","2519110"," that is consistent. "
"2520330","2522010"," You can make a career out of it."
"2522470","2527430"," Now you can take money from doing this and buy your favorite shits.shitco out there or your"
"2527430","2528930"," favorite spec growth or whatever."
"2529870","2537410"," But truly, if you look at, if you were to look in the landscape of anything like Wall Street Bets,"
"2537690","2541890"," Stock Twits, Spin Twit, Yahoo, Bessage Boards, Usenet, doesn't matter. "
"2542330","2548690"," Going all the way back, if you see all the old investors and traders are, they're typically trading"
"2548690","2554410"," the indexes, trading the indexes year over year, decade over decade."
"2555350","2563170"," If you were to look up the most highly traded symbols, it's likely going to be spy, choose some"
"2563170","2566270"," form of that or one of those products."
"2567390","2571870"," You're going to see some memes and you're going to see some of the blue chip tech stocks, right?"
"2573150","2580270"," As a matter of fact, so anyways, at that time I was like, well, let's start teaching new traders,"
"2580330","2581150"," basic tools. "
"2581830","2587010"," So when they go into a trader and investment, they plan that entire trade out and start to finish."
"2588250","2590990"," And they can use these tools that have a high rate of win."
"2592790","2599330"," And so if you have those basic tools in a toolbox, you're less likely to get washed out. "
"2600630","2605930"," Try to lure people by using like bull and bear terms so we can teach them about supply and demand."
"2606910","2608530"," Just basic entry level stuff."
"2609270","2612450"," And that's what I noticed or noticed then too. "
"2612810","2621990"," And I tried books to pick people's brains"
"2621990","2624210"," to watch YouTube videos."
"2624670","2625490"," You name it."
"2626190","2631690"," Audio, I've used to listen to or matter of fact, options profit or actually the options industry"
"2631690","2637450"," council used to just play or download and play their videos over and over and over again. "
"2638390","2646190"," And there was a piece that was missing and that was the actual doing this with somebody else that's"
"2646190","2646910"," done it before me."
"2647650","2654030"," And so I spent some years with mentorships, like people mentoring me live in person to put it all"
"2654030","2654270"," together."
"2655690","2659810"," So that I at least had some basic tools to survive. "
"2661990","2666390"," And I think Portnoy is a good example of that, right?"
"2667190","2674790"," I don't necessarily have a negative or bad take on Dave Portnoy, but you know, when you reach like"
"2674790","2684370"," that, you can really fuck shit up for people without them having a baseline understanding"
"2684370","2687990"," of the mechanics of the market."
"2689310","2690930"," So I wish him well."
"2691890","2697430"," And in his endeavors of day training every day, I would say to you that if you are going to"
"2697430","2703630"," begin to watch his live streams, that anything that you've learned here would apply to anything"
"2703630","2706090"," that you watch in his day training. "
"2706470","2714210"," I hope that a lot of you that love that stuff like trading memes, trading Tesla, trading save or"
"2714210","2720390"," whatever it is that you're you can take anything that you've learned here and apply it to say save"
"2720390","2723170"," if he called that ticker out yesterday or whatever."
"2723630","2729110"," And that's our whole goal here was to just provide tools to you that you can take and always have."
"2729510","2734510"," You can always come back to the cues, come back to the spot and apply those same tools to a"
"2734510","2736430"," ticker like save or whatever that's out there. "
"2736750","2743090"," So I hope that in this time period that people like that that were pushing all that stuff the last"
"2743090","2751430"," time that we've created a class of trader and investor in that time period since people began to"
"2751430","2753290"," get washed out right past two, three years."
"2753830","2759870"," So we've had some time with enough of you that that shit doesn't phase you at all."
"2760210","2763490"," You can actually go there and be like fuck yeah, I'll watch the important way and I'll fucking"
"2763490","2764410"," trade save with them. "
"2764550","2767690"," Oh, that broke down or broke this rule that I have."
"2768410","2771950"," So you know, not just blindly following these guys."
"2772610","2773050"," Make sense?"
"2774010","2775010"," Does that help or no?"
"2775010","2781950"," So I have faith in you guys that if you were to go there and hang out with Dave that"
"2781950","2786410"," you'd probably do a pretty dang up job regardless if save rolled. "
"2787370","2791030"," You'd likely see that roll as it happened, right?"
"2791250","2795390"," So if you're like, all right, Dave just said buy save and I bought save and I watched the save"
"2795390","2796970"," begin to roll down and break down."
"2797710","2800270"," I knew where to cut my losses regardless what Dave was saying."
"2801510","2809350"," If Dave tells you to buy ticker next symbol, XXT 54 and it ends up going up and you make"
"2809350","2815550"," bank on that, you'll likely be able to navigate both of those situations to profit and reducing"
"2815550","2816910"," your losses. "
"2818290","2822710"," So yeah, I got no problem with Dave being out there doing his new thing and not that he gives"
"2822710","2829530"," a fine fuck about me, but I know that the last two years combined."
"2830110","2831930"," I think last two, oh, that's good."
"2832010","2836750"," If we did three years combined, we've reached over a million traders or something like that. "
"2836910","2841110"," It's insane, unique traders that have come to the stream."
"2841330","2846590"," So I think we're doing a good job to stem that washout."
"2847870","2848750"," So yeah, I'm fine. "
"2848990","2849250"," It's good."
"2851630","2860310"," Yeah, I don't think that was true though in the past though, limit buyer."
"2861850","2863910"," I watched the blood man. "
"2864990","2872730"," I watched it happen and I watched it get worse and I watched people delete their accounts in my"
"2872730","2876510"," DMs. Some of the DMs that I used to get from people would make my eyes bleed."
"2877450","2881450"," To be honest, be fully, fully, fully honest. "
"2885050","2885850"," Yeah, all right."
"2886030","2887210"," Oh, hell yeah, nice man."
"2887350","2887570"," That's cool. "
"2889770","2893250"," So yeah, I would say if you want to go watch Dave Porter, please do."
"2894350","2900270"," I'm not anti-Dave Porter in any way, but I think that we've done a good job with whoever didn't"
"2900270","2908010"," get washed out this last cycle to make a stronger base of traders and investors so they can go off"
"2908010","2914830"," and learn whatever they want to learn, whatever, arcane or that's so tarot stuff they want to learn"
"2914830","2915250"," out there."
"2916050","2916730"," Yeah, so I'm proud. "
"2917010","2917170"," I'm good."
"2917630","2917870"," Happy."
"2923470","2924470"," Should get them on. "
"2925670","2930310"," You know, I don't think I would ever, you know, I'm a nobody and to be honest, I want to"
"2930310","2931390"," stay kind of a nobody."
"2932310","2934330"," I don't want someone saying something about Joe Rogan yesterday."
"2934330","2937950"," I'm like, I don't want to, I wouldn't ever do what I was going to show you to be invited. "
"2938170","2940910"," And I wouldn't, probably wouldn't want to talk to Dave either or anyone else."
"2941650","2942550"," I like our group."
"2942730","2943850"," It's like the perfect size. "
"2944470","2945590"," Our group is perfect."
"2947870","2951010"," I don't want to be a firm or a pumper or a dumper and that stuff."
"2951470","2952770"," So hang out with you guys every day. "
"2952870","2953030"," Seriously."
"2954170","2954710"," That's the truth."
"2955430","2957850"," You know, I don't think like, oh, he's just being self-depressatory. "
"2958530","2959290"," Absolutely not."
"2959950","2961470"," I want to be with you guys."
"2961950","2962450"," Small group. "
"2962830","2964290"," You guys, this is like perfect."
"2967130","2968170"," That's a kick-ass group."
"2968330","2969010"," Hey, what's up, Deja?"
"2969170","2969810"," Good to see you, man. "
"2971130","2971990"," Good to see you, brother."
"2973710","2975910"," So we're sitting on the half hour trigger right now."
"2976050","2978910"," Just as an update parked on the half hour trigger. "
"2980210","2982870"," The gamma flip is at 4760."
"2983670","2987850"," There has been no break of trend, so no put spread yet for me."
"2988750","2993930"," There is a little bit of a rug pull setting up here, but I'm sitting on my hands at this"
"2993930","3001210"," point until I see more progress for any kind of confidence in a downside move. "
"3001830","3004350"," I'm going to show you guys why I'm looking for this."
"3004470","3005290"," You guys want to see why?"
"3005910","3007770"," Some of you probably know why I'm looking"
"3007770","3016690"," for that little boy, dude."
"3018910","3020590"," So we should take a look at this. "
"3023070","3025570"," Let me see if I can switch over here."
"3027610","3028130"," Soap."
"3029610","3031950"," This is our SPX seasonality calendar. "
"3032930","3040450"," Now, I want to talk to you about seasonality because we can divert, diverge completely from"
"3040450","3041070"," seasonality."
"3041070","3045970"," We can actually make that break to the downside, and you can kiss all this away."
"3046250","3046570"," It's possible. "
"3047750","3052850"," Now, this is a seasonality calendar that takes into account a presidential election as well."
"3053570","3057630"," So we have not diverged at this point."
"3058450","3062870"," Okay, so the first key point here is, hold on, let me get rid of that. "
"3063330","3066950"," First key point here is this can mean nothing, okay?"
"3067190","3068750"," That's your first rule of a seasonality calendar."
"3070130","3079190"," Your second rule of a seasonality calendar is even if we stay in line, we can make outsized moves."
"3079670","3084190"," We can always do something like this instead where we don't actually go down. "
"3085430","3091110"," We can even roll down and go a little bit deeper than we expect it, right?"
"3091890","3094610"," So they're not always exactly consistent."
"3095310","3103470"," As a matter of fact, let me see if I can get a quick second."
"3104010","3105210"," I'm going to switch over here. "
"3105490","3106050"," Let me bring this."
"3106230","3111470"," I don't want to, I can't show you all this because or what I'm getting there because it's the"
"3111470","3117570"," behind the scenes dashboard of my expectations for this year that is still not been released."
"3118130","3119170"," I'm going to show you a part of it. "
"3119350","3121070"," I've shown you parts of this in the past already."
"3121370","3122630"," So give me a quick second."
"3122810","3123650"," I'm going to show you something here. "
"3128820","3130400"," Now, but something that I saved."
"3132500","3134980"," What I got here, private posts."
"3136900","3138940"," We're going to look at this private post here. "
"3139220","3144840"," I'm going to show you guys last year seasonality calendar and how it looks or how it looks."
"3149340","3150100"," Yeah, cool."
"3150520","3151240"," So this will work. "
"3152240","3155100"," Can I show all of this without getting any trouble?"
"3155280","3156160"," I hope I can."
"3158280","3160120"," I think I can."
"3161420","3162940"," But I'll get in trouble showing this. "
"3163240","3171740"," Okay, so this is the seasonality calendar from last year for SPX and NDX."
"3172580","3177020"," And you can see right here that we somewhat followed it."
"3177140","3178500"," Not exactly, but somewhat. "
"3179760","3184560"," As a matter of fact, one of the key places, this is, let me show you a NDX here or"
"3184560","3185340"," SPX."
"3186140","3191100"," See the high here was early on SPX, right?"
"3191860","3192140"," Boom."
"3192300","3193460"," It's pretty close, right?"
"3194180","3195240"," But look at this one right here. "
"3195400","3203620"," On NDX, we had the high and then we rolled down and the prediction was that we make the high"
"3203620","3204560"," later in time."
"3204820","3208400"," So you see how it didn't quite match up in time, right?"
"3208620","3209260"," We expected it."
"3209460","3213200"," We expected the high later in time, but we got it earlier in time. "
"3213200","3214120"," That was earlier."
"3214720","3215700"," The expectation was later."
"3216220","3219800"," Now it still follows to some extent, right?"
"3220260","3221480"," Spread out over time. "
"3223460","3224720"," Spread out over time."
"3224980","3227220"," It's not so bad, right?"
"3227660","3228100"," Not so bad."
"3228260","3231140"," So does it mean that we're going to follow this exactly?"
"3231760","3232180"," No. "
"3232520","3233780"," There's no expectation of that."
"3233980","3240900"," Another thing to look at on this seasonality calendar is there's a, this is just today right here."
"3241040","3242120"," So, right?"
"3242240","3242840"," So we're down. "
"3243240","3244240"," We're expecting to move up."
"3245900","3249140"," And then another down move into the 31st over here."
"3249380","3252020"," So I'm looking for that 31st rolls my points. "
"3253380","3256420"," Okay, so let me show this to you again here, right?"
"3256960","3265440"," I'm looking for the roll into the 31st, which is down over here."
"3265600","3266640"," So right here."
"3268820","3270400"," That's the 19th session. "
"3271180","3273000"," That comes into the end of the month."
"3273880","3280260"," And then I'm looking for that big move to the upside into mid February around, around Valentine's"
"3280260","3280880"," Day."
"3282560","3284640"," So that's why I'm looking for that. "
"3285100","3293640"," That's why I'm looking for today specifically to catch a roll to the downside into the 31st on this"
"3293640","3294620"," unclunching today."
"3307770","3308890"," Yeah, I've got the cat."
"3309010","3309470"," I've got the cat. "
"3309590","3310010"," That's the calendar."
"3310290","3311450"," I got the calendar dates, right?"
"3311770","3318070"," So today is the day out of the unclunching should lead to it's not quite huge downside."
"3318150","3319930"," NDX actually should trade sideways. "
"3321450","3323370"," Spy should have more meaningful downside."
"3324430","3331770"," And then we rock and roll on the 31st, which happens to coincide with tech earnings."
"3333370","3340250"," Tech earnings really ramp towards the 30th, 31st, 1st, 2nd, 3rd of February. "
"3342070","3344090"," It's like a consolidation period."
"3344410","3347530"," You'd have like tech trading sideways and up like ping ponging."
"3348390","3355750"," And then you'd have SPY or SPX just kind of trading sideways and slightly down, which still"
"3355750","3358110"," eventually resolves to the upside. "
"3359650","3360350"," You get what I'm saying?"
"3360550","3369710"," So if we can stay up here today at any point, trade 4,800 taking like a 4,850, 4 "
"3369710","3376470",",700 or 4,750 or something, put spread for some kind of a sideways and down action that I can"
"3376470","3378090"," monetize into the end of the month."
"3378450","3383890"," It also lends me protection in the end of the month if there is more significant downside action."
"3384970","3386010"," I have that protection. "
"3386750","3387710"," And I'll still trade it up."
"3387850","3392310"," If we trade up or something like that, I'll leave that put spread on, maybe cut a leg off and"
"3392310","3397010"," trade zero dates all the way up if we don't actually have that pullback into the end of the month."
"3397970","3400770"," Now, there is something here to discuss. "
"3403510","3404790"," Well, that is important."
"3406350","3408190"," We have an important something important."
"3408550","3412790"," Oh, although also above, we've got 4825 or 4."
"3413090","3413890"," Let me show you that up here. "
"3415650","3417870"," Right up here is the next level, baby."
"3419190","3422690"," And we'll move this one here."
"3422690","3424170"," That was the upside target. "
"3425490","3426990"," So put that one right there."
"3428170","3432590"," Now, there's something else we have to discuss here because we're all over the place on what we"
"3432590","3433930"," expect that pullback to be."
"3435610","3438150"," I think everyone's making a valid point. "
"3438490","3441770"," If I speak to someone that someone will be like, well, I expect 440."
"3442510","3445590"," I'm like, yeah, that looks right and they're reasoning sounds logical to me."
"3445870","3447290"," Someone else is like, we're going to get 460. "
"3447550","3449130"," I'm like, that guy sounds right too."
"3450150","3455930"," I see other people out there saying things like, we're going to 4,100 or we're going no lower than"
"3455930","3457090"," 4,700 cap."
"3457610","3461110"," Everybody's making good points out there as to how deep the role is going to be. "
"3462450","3465230"," So I got to put some validity into some of that."
"3465530","3471850"," But there is something that we can probably parse that has kind of worked for me in the past."
"3472690","3473970"," So let's take a look at that really quick. "
"3492140","3495360"," We're going to take a look at cycles here."
"3496100","3501820"," Now, I like to put on PMI and PMO with this market breath indicator."
"3503600","3509380"," Let's see if we can find out who makes this here. "
"3512060","3513440"," Can I see who makes this here?"
"3513840","3515460"," How do I find out who makes this thing?"
"3516940","3526340"," Anyways, this indicator down below is the market breath indicator from Iceman"
"3526340","3527060"," Ran."
"3530200","3536120"," Then what I find fascinating right now, oh, I only use this on a daily basis, like a day chart."
"3536660","3540300"," So set your time frame, time series time frame to a daily. "
"3540960","3549440"," I don't use this on any of the time frame just one day and I'm always looking for divergence in"
"3549440","3552180"," divergence in breadth."
"3554820","3555820"," So that's over here."
"3556940","3564420"," I was looking for divergence in breadth and price. "
"3565720","3574660"," So as we're losing breadth is price coming down in a meaningful way, right?"
"3574780","3580000"," So then when we get this last little bit down here, you get that last little push to the downside."
"3581760","3589740"," Or are we not getting that follow through on price as we get lower breadth, right?"
"3590240","3595360"," When we don't get that, I'm going to show you what happens, okay?"
"3595920","3598800"," When we don't get that, it's right here."
"3599580","3600800"," Here's an example of it. "
"3602100","3602900"," You see it?"
"3604340","3610580"," So we're coming down, grinding, grinding, grinding, but then we pull our asses out and boom, make"
"3610580","3611960"," up giant move to the upside."
"3612980","3618340"," You can actually see right here, we got some, we got some violence down here that was good to see,"
"3618540","3618660"," right?"
"3619440","3623940"," Got a little pump up here, but then boom, more downside and boom, there we go, right?"
"3624100","3630180"," Some follow through, follow through on the downside here, okay?"
"3631040","3634720"," So currently we're looking more like this, aren't we, than we are this."
"3636460","3639720"," And this is kind of making the same statement here. "
"3639840","3643960"," It's saying, even if we do pull down cap, it's not going to be as bad as you think it"
"3643960","3644100"," is."
"3645560","3655380"," So maybe 460 at the worst possible that it's only 470 in this rotation here."
"3655500","3661620"," You can see something like this, we start heading right up here and we don't get any constructive"
"3661620","3664760"," downside move in the market. "
"3666480","3673240"," You don't get a capitulation in the rotation, right?"
"3673280","3676400"," You don't get a market liquidation, a sector liquidation."
"3677180","3685480"," You make a successful rotation from risk on to risk off sectors and then back into risk on again."
"3687300","3692220"," So I'd be weary, I'm not weary, I mean it's possible we could trade 460, possibly we could trade"
"3692220","3698980"," lower 4,400, 4,200, but right now market breath is saying no to that. "
"3699500","3707380"," It's showing to limit your downside expectations here in whatever this unclench is."
"3717670","3719850"," Here's spoons again, this is SPY."
"3727250","3732910"," So there's some hints or indicators out there saying, and if we don't start accelerating in price"
"3732910","3740470"," to the downside, we might just trade sideways slightly down and then boom, we're making a run for"
"3740470","3742110"," it to February. "
"3742730","3745510"," And we've got tech ERs right on that first."
"3746210","3755700"," So we're not getting that right as of right now, we're not getting a liquidation phase."
"3755700","3757060"," This rotation is the point. "
"3758900","3767520"," Normally get down underneath 30, get like minus or you get to like 30% bullishness in stocks and"
"3767520","3767960"," then they rotate."
"3768460","3774800"," If they don't do that, we start breaking down to 20, you start to see forced liquidations and"
"3774800","3777300"," sectors and we're just not seeing it right now."
"3781410","3783750"," See a market breath indicator, it's free. "
"3784170","3785490"," It's on a trading view."
"3786930","3791550"," There's a couple PMO and PMI indicators that are free on trading view as well."
"3791750","3796590"," You can look for those three combined really lend some insight on the underneath part of that"
"3796590","3797190"," breath indicator. "
"3802710","3804510"," Chase, you're a short man right now."
"3805470","3806430"," Not me, man."
"3808470","3809370"," Not me, dude. "
"3810030","3811270"," You think you get squeezed out?"
"3811450","3814970"," If we make that run to the upside, Chase, where you get squeezed out, where you do maintenance,"
"3814970","3815730"," what will you do?"
"3822910","3828390"," Do you think there's a chance to squeeze you out, Chase, in February, from that positioning or no?"
"3833630","3834850"," Yeah, so there's like this."
"3835290","3840870"," What can happen is this, we can rotate, well, you'll help others money rotates from sector to"
"3840870","3842230"," sector in the market."
"3842230","3845090"," So you have the S&P 500, right?"
"3845650","3848390"," It has all these sectors make up the S&P 500. "
"3849630","3859490"," Money flows from sector to sector and sometimes when we're rotating, if money"
"3859490","3865190"," is exiting the market, we'll get too low and it'll trigger CTA selling."
"3865990","3873790"," If we don't trigger that CTA selling though in that next rotation, money's not exiting the market,"
"3874930","3877990"," we will consolidate sideways and then begin to rip higher."
"3878330","3880230"," We won't even make any significant downside moves. "
"3880870","3884790"," Right now, we're not triggering any of that selling at this point."
"3884990","3893150"," So until that happens, we can't trigger a liquidation."
"3899380","3901580"," So you did get short yesterday, Scotty. "
"3902600","3903860"," I'm still waiting here."
"3904020","3909860"," I'm like, yesterday we broke above on Gama and then slammed down and held it."
"3909920","3913200"," I was like, yeah, we ain't buying any kind of put spreads yet. "
"3913780","3915780"," They're going to try to make a run to the upside."
"3916240","3917640"," They're trying to do it again right now."
"3918340","3922100"," I wonder if I should just put them on right now, Scotty and join you. "
"3922300","3922840"," Should I start a position?"
"3923780","3927960"," Let's take a look at some together really quick."
"3927980","3928600"," Hold on, brother."
"3933810","3935490"," I'm interested, Scotty. "
"3938130","3939310"," Let's take a look and see."
"3942110","3947640"," I haven't even looked at him yet this morning, but I'm going to look at him right now."
"3949840","3952400"," Looking at 45, 470s, right?"
"3957010","3958330"," Let's look at bearish. "
"3959870","3961330"," Put spread will make it simple."
"3962470","3963970"," I'm not going to get crazy here."
"3968130","3970830"," 31st, 485. "
"3971650","3974450"," Let's take a peek at that strike and see what that's looking like."
"3976150","3978390"," Risk $668."
"3983030","3992280"," Get $67,000. "
"3993000","4001560"," My God, for 100 contracts, 67 grand."
"4008290","4010830"," Every contract, 670 bucks."
"4012150","4012630"," That's dude. "
"4012870","4014010"," So fucking expensive."
"4014470","4017690"," Looks like somebody else is already buying puts."
"4021060","4022800"," That's not really helping me here. "
"4023500","4026440"," I got to be below 478 30 to hit profit."
"4028060","4030220"," 478 30 to hit profit."
"4035400","4039120"," And to really start maxing profit, I got to be under 470. "
"4041060","4043000"," Let's raise this up a little bit."
"4043690","4046640"," Let's raise this up a little bit."
"4046700","4047080"," What's 475?"
"4049820","4050440"," 485475. "
"4050760","4051420"," That's not too bad."
"4054100","4055740"," This one's not too shabby."
"4056520","4062000"," I only need to be in profit below 4 or max profit below 475. "
"4065520","4066580"," What is for?"
"4067260","4069920"," It's actually pretty juicy."
"4073580","4074220"," 45, 480."
"4074480","4075080"," Let's look at that one. "
"4077840","4079500"," Uh, 45, 4."
"4079780","4080660"," Ooh, I like that one too."
"4082920","4083700"," That's a good one."
"4085840","4086680"," Doesn't pay a ton. "
"4086840","4087300"," Let me show you this."
"4087420","4088320"," Let me show you guys this one."
"4090740","4097040"," This is by January 31. "
"4098819","4102080"," 45, long put, 480."
"4105420","4106540"," Short put."
"4110100","4113080"," And it's in profit below 480. "
"4115500","4118439"," Now this is going to be more of a time trade, right?"
"4124740","4126720"," I like the idea earlier."
"4127000","4129500"," I was thinking 470, but I don't like it anymore."
"4132760","4135140"," Cost 600 bucks to contract 650. "
"4135819","4137140"," It pays 856."
"4138620","4139040"," 857."
"4140040","4141779"," I might have to just buy some puts here. "
"4143359","4145740"," I may not be buying a put spread."
"4147760","4151100"," I may be switching my take here."
"4154380","4156420"," I'm going to look at the options chain here. "
"4156540","4157100"," Hold on a second here."
"4161720","4162460"," Yeah, I'm not."
"4162979","4164660"," I would sell call spreads. "
"4165260","4166620"," I want to take a look at something here."
"4166740","4166960"," Hold on."
"4181590","4189729"," You know, like 470s for the 31st are $1.31. That's pretty juicy. "
"4189990","4190550"," That's pretty pricey."
"4191370","4191710"," That's expensive."
"4202850","4205050"," February 16th. "
"4211190","4212550"," They're $3."
"4221830","4225390"," I'm going to buy just buying some puts, but they're pretty expensive."
"4227090","4227930"," I'm going to wait. "
"4228870","4229190"," Keep looking."
"4229950","4231470"," Yeah, selling call spreads be nice."
"4232350","4235390"," Or just selling some OTM stuff would be nice too, right?"
"4239210","4240950"," Yeah, I don't like that trade right now. "
"4241810","4242890"," I don't like the price of that trade."
"4247460","4256100"," Yeah, I was going to I just looked at the options chain for February 16th to monetize on the 31st."
"4259860","4261920"," I wouldn't hold them to the 16th. "
"4261920","4267560"," I just buy them from now and then I don't all I can not get the theta burn."
"4278760","4279660"," Yeah, that's for meta."
"4281020","4282740"," I should probably look at meta too, huh?"
"4283480","4289430"," Yeah, I got I can't take that trade right now. "
"4289530","4289870"," I'm looking out."
"4290270","4297670"," I'm not seeing a trade right now that I like for the price of the cost of it on spoons"
"4297670","4298190"," right now."
"4300310","4306670"," So it sucks about like puts you know what sucks about puts on the spy specifically. "
"4307130","4312670"," SPX is kind of better, but spy don't like I feel like it's I have to do it that day."
"4315850","4319150"," They're like built to fucking just get they're built to suck."
"4324820","4327000"," Spy puts are like Johnny on the spot. "
"4336490","4337850"," What are you in Scotty?"
"4337950","4338210"," Are you in?"
"4338430","4341350"," Are you actually short or are you in spreads?"
"4342010","4342870"," What's your positioning?"
"4348810","4349510"," They are."
"4350210","4356250"," They're not built the same so they're not built to act the same way as calls."
"4356570","4357130"," You know that right?"
"4362190","4363810"," Yeah, they're not built. "
"4364350","4369890"," Are you so Scotty, are you actually short or are you long puts or what are you here?"
"4370630","4371130"," Did you sell calls?"
"4371610","4372010"," Did you write calls?"
"4372210","4372450"," What'd you do?"
"4379440","4380640"," Where is he right now?"
"4380700","4381820"," I saw him in the stream earlier."
"4389710","4391530"," Oh, you're probably gonna have to roll."
"4393030","4394370"," Yeah, I'm going to buy puts. "
"4394590","4396550"," I'm going to buy him for a February 16th brother."
"4397330","4404290"," Put spreads or I wanted to do 100 pack of put spreads today, but 69,000 dollars."
"4406010","4411110"," I'm like I'm looking at 100 pack and I'm like like call spreads. "
"4411930","4413130"," We already discussed that right?"
"4413370","4415470"," B-shaped usually pretty easy to time."
"4416930","4420450"," I'm not getting fucking blown out on 70 grand to fucking put spreads."
"4420770","4421490"," No fucking way. "
"4423170","4429990"," So I'm going to need to see some I'm going to need to see some confirmation to get shortish or"
"4429990","4432630"," short through being long and short."
"4441060","4443520"," Oh, they expire today 477 P."
"4448240","4449200"," I've called man."
"4449360","4450360"," I think they're going to park this. "
"4450940","4456980"," My fear too here is that they pin this shit in the bell and then we fucking creepy crawl it"
"4456980","4460600"," and then you're like supposed to buy for like 414 this afternoon by some puts."
"4463760","4465520"," That's my like big fear today."
"4466400","4467660"," There's like sideways. "
"4469240","4474620"," Run it up into the bell and then you're supposed to like place a fucking put spread at 414 in"
"4474620","4475020"," the afternoon."
"4483580","4491830"," Hold on here."
"4493830","4495070"," Ooh, what do we got here?"
"4496570","4497490"," A copy?"
"4505690","4507710"," That's the term structure show and we look. "
"4510750","4512850"," I'm looking right now at the term structure brother."
"4520190","4524090"," You see that creep over there on the on January 22nd."
"4525410","4527130"," You see that creep over there?"
"4527130","4529170"," Uh, prayer podcast. "
"4531710","4532590"," That's new, right?"
"4532770","4534010"," That wasn't there yesterday, was it?"
"4537350","4538150"," 2-2."
"4538390","4541330"," There's there's February right there, February 16th."
"4542290","4544590"," So I got to try to catch this window right here. "
"4545410","4548210"," Yeah, this is making me look like I got to wait until the end of the day."
"4554160","4555640"," Now you're saying push it out in May."
"4555840","4557200"," I see this out in May 2, bro. "
"4559280","4564600"," Or I see April 30th into June 21st."
"4569840","4571140"," Let me take a look right now."
"4591910","4593950"," Still kind of expensive out there, man. "
"4598970","4600210"," I'm looking right now, traitor."
"4609250","4610770"," Yeah, I'm looking at it right now."
"4616800","4617620"," Hold on, brother. "
"4636490","4638010"," Looking right now here."
"4638230","4638450"," Hold on."
"4664800","4665760"," Ooh, that's nice. "
"4666940","4668440"," All right, I like this better."
"4676530","4678070"," I do like this better."
"4684730","4685550"," Fair podcast. "
"4685890","4687210"," I'm going to take a look at the edit here with you, brother."
"4687870","4689410"," This is all time stuff, too."
"4696700","4698760"," Here's May 17th. "
"4700700","4703540"," This is 478, 450."
"4715220","4716340"," 485, 470."
"4724020","4725320"," This is juicy. "
"4725620","4726240"," I like this one."
"4726980","4730060"," That one's pretty nice, and there's a lot of time on this."
"4738940","4740160"," I like that trade. "
"4744400","4745240"," I like that."
"4745340","4746700"," I like this trade right here."
"4750080","4751000"," I'm going to keep. "
"4751160","4753640"," I'm going to monitor this trade as the day moves on."
"4753820","4763800"," It's May 17th, 2024, 45p, 470p, so"
"4763800","4766000"," buy a 45-foot."
"4766820","4773800"," Sell a 470-foot, cost is $528, but the gain is $971. "
"4775500","4776480"," I like that."
"4776760","4777500"," I like that trade."
"4778960","4779960"," I like that trade. "
"4780100","4780540"," That's a good trade."
"4781420","4783460"," That's making me happier just looking at that."
"4786080","4792040"," My question becomes, do we ever get back down into this 480, or do we hold 480 from here?"
"4796090","4797690"," Let me look at something else here. "
"4799410","4801030"," 490, 480."
"4804070","4805450"," That's not too bad either."
"4806770","4814890"," Okay, so you're in profit under 488, and then 480"
"4814890","4818690"," max profit. "
"4819470","4820650"," I like this one."
"4822530","4823770"," I like this one a lot."
"4825210","4826490"," I'm going to leave that one up. "
"4826670","4833430"," That's a 490, 480p in case we do hit that 500 target."
"4833430","4838090"," It gives me until May 17th to tag that."
"4838390","4839590"," It's 100% trade almost. "
"4840870","4842330"," A little bit more than 100% trade."
"4845110","4851370"," I like them because I like them because I don't use them a lot, but I do like having that"
"4851370","4851830"," exposure."
"4854130","4857590"," I do like having that exposure when we have pullbacks. "
"4859510","4865490"," I know there's a lot of bears here that get blown out, so I do a lot of day trading"
"4865490","4870730"," on the show, so I kind of like the idea of showing some other stuff on the show, and so"
"4870730","4877780"," I'm looking at this right now, and I'm like, if I'm underneath 45, I'm starting to make money."
"4878620","4885420"," So if we made a run to 500 or 5,000, do I think we'd roll down 150 points between"
"4885420","4889120"," that point and May 17th would be the real question."
"4903630","4904530"," Boiler room, Bob. "
"4911850","4912670"," Trade podcast."
"4913010","4913450"," Take it easy, brother."
"4913650","4914110"," Have a good day. "
"4927630","4929810"," I went to enter until I hit 5,000."
"4930050","4930370"," Fuck no."
"4932070","4934450"," I'm looking at the upside consequences. "
"4935350","4936330"," Hold on a second here."
"4936670","4937470"," Hold on a second."
"4937570","4939410"," We got who's just asked that question. "
"4939470","4940210"," Who is that person?"
"4941310","4945350"," To clarify, you wouldn't enter until we hit 5,000."
"4945570","4945710"," No."
"4946650","4955130"," I would enter now, enter now, right, or today or something, and be able to withstand the trip to 5 "
"4955130","4955630",",000. "
"4956090","4957150"," That's my question."
"4958090","4959090"," Does that make sense?"
"4959730","4965130"," So if my thesis is, we're going to have some downside movements into the end of the month, and"
"4965130","4968850"," we're going to have a really nasty correction into mid-March."
"4970210","4971910"," And the trade goes against me. "
"4973290","4975610"," Let's say we ramp up into 5,000, right?"
"4976370","4981450"," And does it come back down before the expiry below"
"4981450","4987370"," 485?"
"4987850","4991970"," All right, I'd need it to come below 45, 47 at some point."
"4994230","4998350"," Let me go back to over here and explain this better to you."
"4998890","5000190"," Uh, more simply. "
"5002190","5003330"," Here's the chart again."
"5006030","5011050"," Whatever I'm taking a trade, I'm always looking at, hey, this is my thesis, right?"
"5011370","5012690"," Yeah, fuck you outta make all this money."
"5013630","5016550"," And what if a price actually goes against me?"
"5019390","5022990"," Well, I got to start day trading calls, right?"
"5026150","5029030"," And, oh, my put spreads look like shit. "
"5029550","5030190"," Oh, no."
"5030750","5031270"," What did I do?"
"5032870","5033390"," Right?"
"5033830","5035230"," This is my thesis."
"5037870","5043010"," But then we hit that seasonal weakness in March, this February 14th up here. "
"5043790","5046830"," Doesn't at least come back down there for a moment."
"5047870","5048690"," Because what would that mean?"
"5048950","5049930"," I could trade all this up."
"5050570","5052030"," I could trade all that up. "
"5053110","5057190"," And then circle back around and monetize my put spread."
"5058270","5058990"," Does that make sense?"
"5059970","5062110"," So I'm looking for my thesis trade."
"5063030","5068150"," And if it goes wrong, does it at least come back into some semblance of not getting blown out?"
"5070330","5071270"," Does that make sense?"
"5071670","5071870"," Or no?"
"5073410","5074430"," Who asked that question?"
"5074630","5075170"," Oh, it's a good question. "
"5077170","5077830"," Yeah, yeah."
"5077830","5078490"," Oh, it's okay."
"5078570","5078910"," It's a trader. "
"5079490","5080350"," Hold on a second here."
"5091260","5092460"," It's a trader, Moxie."
"5092580","5096820"," Do you get what I'm throwing down now?"
"5102210","5103050"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"5103970","5110370"," So every trade you take, you try to think about what's your thesis, right?"
"5112870","5113910"," Entering at the right place."
"5115430","5115870"," Right?"
"5115990","5116570"," What does that mean?"
"5118250","5119210"," Entering at the right place."
"5119410","5119910"," What does that mean?"
"5121490","5128150"," That means if, uh, if we're going down, right?"
"5128550","5133090"," If we're going down, I'm entering puts here, right?"
"5133730","5134510"," Not right here. "
"5135550","5137670"," You know, because I'm like, ah, they're burning my puts."
"5138150","5138410"," Ah, fuck."
"5138550","5139310"," They're back in the money again. "
"5139790","5142530"," Kind of want me entering here, right?"
"5143010","5143990"," Woohoo, making money."
"5144830","5146930"," Not, uh, up just a little bit."
"5147050","5147830"," Woohoo, making money. "
"5151230","5152910"," So that's number two, right?"
"5153130","5153450"," Timing."
"5153790","5161370"," And then number three is, if the trade goes against me, where do I, uh, DCA?"
"5161610","5162790"," Where do I cut my losses?"
"5163730","5164010"," How bad?"
"5164210","5165810"," How much pain can I stand in that trade?"
"5167470","5168630"," That kind of stuff."
"5168950","5170730"," What's my like worst up case scenario?"
"5171670","5174450"," Worst up case scenario is probably 5,000, right?"
"5175410","5176230"," Or 500. "
"5177310","5178510"," Or close to it."
"5178670","5181550"," It's like 49 something, you know, an SPX."
"5181870","5186330"," And that's where the, uh, that's where the, uh, top end of the JPM collar is too. "
"5198240","5199120"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"5199120","5202180"," I traded my, my, uh, trader moxie."
"5205710","5207450"," All right, so Twitch here. "
"5210690","5214130"," Yeah, like what can you, and I was asking Chase that earlier."
"5214550","5216770"," Chase said that he's maxed short right now."
"5217730","5222990"," So my question to Chase was, how do you mitigate an upside move to 5,000?"
"5223410","5224330"," No pullback. "
"5224670","5226170"," We just go fucking to 5,000."
"5226910","5228450"," Do you do the maintenance on that?"
"5228610","5231250"," Even if you are writing your thesis, uh, do you trade it up?"
"5232170","5234430"," Do you put cheap outside the money calls in that trade?"
"5236210","5237730"," So that's going to chase here earlier."
"5238290","5242950"," If you had a, not just the thesis, but what's your counter trade to that?"
"5276000","5277780"," What's been going on with Mr. Yen?"
"5278000","5278540"," Is he all right?"
"5279540","5282140"," I haven't seen him on, uh, on Twitter. "
"5282960","5284120"," What was he saying on Twitter?"
"5289650","5291570"," Can I please do Tesla now?"
"5291690","5292610"," Yeah, we can look at Tesla again."
"5295810","5296810"," What's going on, Kamal?"
"5296970","5297390"," How you doing, man?"
"5298770","5299570"," How you doing, brother?"
"5301110","5309260"," A short term, you go long and, uh, longer puts run."
"5309420","5312520"," Jimmy, on my side, I'll let the longer puts run. "
"5313080","5314760"," Yeah, that's not sticking the same thing, Jimmy Barry."
"5314940","5315280"," Good to see you."
"5315400","5316180"," Good morning, Jimmy Barry. "
"5329600","5330800"," He's been working on NQ."
"5331680","5333560"," Is, does he, uh, bearish right now or no?"
"5334560","5336180"," I thought it wasn't he bearish at one point."
"5336320","5340140"," I thought he said that, uh, I thought I heard him say that he was bearish at one point on"
"5340140","5341540"," Twitter like a couple weeks ago. "
"5357600","5360000"," Man, Tesla's looking weak right now, isn't it?"
"5360540","5362420"," Rejection above on the hourly trigger."
"5364040","5365800"," I'm watching, I'm watching Tesla right here."
"5365940","5369160"," There's no dip buy trade yet on Tesla. "
"5376240","5378500"," We're at minus 29 right here."
"5379940","5381840"," So we're not at minus 50 yet."
"5384600","5386380"," So I got no trade here on Tesla. "
"5393260","5395020"," Yeah, Joe, I'm looking at Tesla, man."
"5395080","5395600"," I'm not seeing it."
"5397700","5400060"," There is some cool we should look at though on Tesla. "
"5401160","5403640"," It goes by squeezing on up again."
"5406560","5408640"," Still watching these put spreads here."
"5408800","5411240"," They're at 450 right now for 548. "
"5412780","5420560"," I should put a stink fit in it like 425 or something on that trade or go higher up in"
"5420560","5422740"," strikes go like 490 500."
"5423280","5428200"," We look at 5000 or 500 490."
"5430440","5432240"," It's actually not a bad trade either. "
"5433340","5438240"," Put spread for 45490 for May 17th."
"5438260","5444040"," It costs 627 626 and pays 370."
"5445060","5446500"," I'm going to look at that one too. "
"5447780","5450060"," That one pays below 493."
"5465010","5466150"," He's bearish on NQ."
"5467590","5469570"," You said, wait a minute, I'm trying to see what you guys said. "
"5470050","5471450"," He's been up all night trading now."
"5471530","5472930"," Oh, he was up all night trading NQ."
"5473170","5475110"," Well, last night was he up trading NQ last night?"
"5478090","5480610"," He is bearish or he is the goat. "
"5480810","5481570"," He is the fucking goat."
"5481810","5482650"," He's a fucking man, dude."
"5483290","5485290"," I watched this show for years. "
"5485430","5486610"," Got guys amazing."
"5504530","5505710"," It's live, baby."
"5506750","5507510"," It's live. "
"5509150","5510210"," It's in real time."
"5522670","5523710"," YEN up all night."
"5525290","5527090"," YEN up all night. "
"5527670","5531290"," I remember the, I wish I was like, was that a USA network or something?"
"5531930","5532830"," What was that?"
"5533230","5533850"," Something up all night."
"5533850","5537150"," I remember that jingle back in the day."
"5546800","5550440"," We get a version of it that's going to be real time too embedded on the website. "
"5551900","5552980"," It's going to be pretty awesome."
"5563810","5565770"," Look at that SPX wall."
"5566050","5567490"," We're just breaking through it right now. "
"5568330","5569490"," See this wall right here?"
"5570370","5571990"," Just smashing and bashing right here."
"5572090","5573830"," But to squeeze and break through this wall."
"5575410","5576810"," You want to see that right there?"
"5576810","5578210"," Can you see that on your screen?"
"5578390","5579410"," Hold and bring this down for you. "
"5582410","5583830"," Keep your eyes right here."
"5585090","5587130"," Are we going to get all time high on SPX?"
"5590510","5591650"," You guys know where that is?"
"5591730","5592290"," This is all time."
"5592430","5594090"," Let me get to gash show you guys all time highs. "
"5598140","5600360"," It's at 418 16 or something, right?"
"5601060","5610950"," I think that's all time"
"5610950","5611750"," highs right there."
"5619560","5620920"," All time high, baby."
"5620920","5624080"," If you're going to break all time highs, your mind is going to break it with like a whale, right?"
"5670970","5672890"," Be all time high is one more time. "
"5684060","5685380"," Yeah, that's where it is up there."
"5697180","5699560"," Climb in the wall of worry right now."
"5705950","5709270"," Got a nice full cross back test on the half hour trigger. "
"5710890","5712150"," Target to the upside."
"5713990","5714870"," 479 40."
"5729840","5731660"," Got a nice full cross right here. "
"5731660","5735200"," Got a nice test here of the half hour trigger."
"5736680","5740220"," We can get up here and tag that and slam right in that one right there."
"5765660","5768020"," Look at Tesla not joining in at all. "
"5768340","5769920"," Tesla looking extremely bearish here."
"5782850","5784610"," GME looking pretty bullish here."
"5784790","5788710"," GME, if it holds 1430, it's constructive. "
"5789050","5790890"," I'll call it constructive at this point."
"5792830","5794790"," GME looking constructive here."
"5803160","5805360"," AMC just grinding along. "
"5805620","5807340"," It just needs to stay on this path."
"5808060","5817640"," If you're looking for a dip on AMC $4.36, I'd say it could even come down to"
"5817640","5818400"," 428."
"5820060","5829960"," As long as you don't breach and break and reject $4.28. Let's see if I got that right"
"5829960","5833660"," and maybe hold on hold on a second. "
"5833820","5834940"," I could clean that up a little bit."
"5845530","5855530"," Maybe clear on that $4.18 as long as you don't break $4.18. Trend is $4.36"
"5855530","5856790"," on AMC."
"5863860","5865440"," SPX blasting now. "
"5866780","5870740"," It's trading above its call while at $4,800."
"5871560","5875380"," Trying to trade all time highs again at $4,8, 18 and some change."
"5884090","5888530"," Goldman Sachs is seeing limited impact on the dollar from the Fed's QT policy. "
"5888530","5893090"," According to Goldman Sachs, changes in the Fed's bounce sheet have the greatest impact on the bond"
"5893090","5898310"," term premium, which has far less influence on the dollar than interest rate policy."
"5913480","5915240"," Squeezing up now to the top there."
"5917700","5922680"," And this red bar right here is likely R2, so we can even extend all the way up past that"
"5922680","5924600"," yellow bar that I have up there. "
"5938120","5942140"," Even if there is a reversal, this is looking pretty open, pretty valid to get up there."
"5966110","5968950"," I got the bullish music I found and I thought I deleted it."
"5969290","5970510"," I played some yesterday. "
"5972950","5974450"," I played some yesterday, Josh."
"5976390","5978150"," No need to ever short the market."
"5981430","5983510"," How is the market breath indicator down?"
"5983810","5986090"," I ran over the market breath indicator earlier, Chase. "
"5987110","5989430"," It's not a good sign for Bayer's brother."
"5991150","5996110"," So when you see them, a lot of people out there seem to say that price isn't following market"
"5996110","5996430"," breath."
"5996630","5997610"," That means crash is incoming. "
"5997950","5998950"," That has not been the case."
"6000110","6009810"," It has led to consolidation and lowered expectations to downside and then a continuation"
"6009810","6010910"," to the upside, bro."
"6012070","6016230"," It's not on your side right now that that market breath indicator is not on a Bayer's side for"
"6016230","6018870"," significant downside moves. "
"6021690","6025990"," The R3, by the way, is up here right here."
"6028210","6028690"," 48282."
"6044030","6048430"," Truly expecting comments from Fed's daily as she appears on Fox Business News. "
"6063120","6064260"," 620 for 380."
"6088220","6092440"," Man, I'm not going to do it, but I got to tell you, just at this moment right here."
"6093960","6100740"," At this moment right here, I was like, I just want to slam the fucking buy button on puts for"
"6100740","6101640"," the 31st. "
"6103220","6104320"," It can't though."
"6108520","6121010"," Like just"
"6121010","6124690"," at that moment, I was like, I should just fucking buy fucking puts right here."
"6125190","6127090"," Like in the money for the 31st. "
"6127090","6132070"," It could be breaking my own rules."
"6155500","6157640"," Look at that beautiful thing up there."
"6159560","6162020"," That little level way up there right there. "
"6164280","6166560"," I've got this bad boy up here."
"6167060","6169480"," Don't want to fuck around without filling that shit up there."
"6174490","6177910"," See that one right there, ain't messing around until that shit gets filled in. "
"6177910","6178470"," No way."
"6186360","6188240"," No way, I'm messing with that one."
"6195330","6196910"," GME, let's have a look at that. "
"6200090","6203090"," GME still constructive here, looking good for a nice turn."
"6204710","6206570"," Take a look at Tesla really quick in the background."
"6206990","6207810"," See if there's anything there. "
"6208050","6208570"," Oh, Tesla."
"6208890","6210890"," Oh, what are you doing, Tesla?"
"6214310","6215190"," Oh, Tesla."
"6229620","6230980"," Oh, Tesla, Tesla. "
"6243270","6244470"," Come on, Tesla."
"6249730","6251830"," You're getting fucking logged out."
"6252350","6253390"," What the fuck are you doing?"
"6280270","6281810"," Uh, Tesla. "
"6292200","6293380"," Can't believe I'm doing this."
"6293820","6294560"," I'm long, Tesla."
"6296760","6298320"," I'm long, Tesla here. "
"6300860","6306060"," I got some calls now for, uh, January 26th."
"6307880","6309500"," Please, Lord, forgive me."
"6315040","6316320"," No, fuck me. "
"6317900","6319920"," I got some Tesla calls."
"6320320","6321500"," I got some exposure here."
"6329030","6330430"," I got Tesla calls. "
"6330670","6332450"," Please tell me to fuck this up on Tesla."
"6332450","6342240"," I got some"
"6342240","6342740"," exposure."
"6359130","6360990"," Who's that Joshua Tesla?"
"6363670","6372630"," No, I grabbed, um, I've got, uh, 235 C's for January, uh, 26th. "
"6374270","6376470"," January 26th, 235 C."
"6377650","6379150"," And I should not be buying these here."
"6383930","6402860"," Let's see"
"6402860","6403540"," what happens here."
"6403900","6404600"," I'm watching it closely. "
"6406380","6409640"," I've got it open on a, on a screen or below you can't see."
"6426080","6433790"," I'm watching this flattening of the hourly here."
"6437430","6444930"," So I'm a little early here, but I'm slightly early here. "
"6446190","6454790"," I shouldn't, I shouldn't be taking this trade, but if we start blasting down, just cut them loose."
"6489160","6491080"," Are you following me and I wouldn't?"
"6491820","6493180"," I, I'll be honest with you."
"6493220","6493560"," This is real. "
"6493760","6494540"," I'm not fucking around yet."
"6494680","6495860"," Do not follow me on that trade."
"6498140","6503500"," You want to see a price above, at least above 210. "
"6508590","6510050"," I'm going to say no to you."
"6512330","6513530"," I'm being serious there."
"6513710","6514510"," Don't, don't do that. "
"6516590","6519370"," It's, it's like a very risky thing that I'm doing right now."
"6523310","6524370"," I'm being serious."
"6525210","6526650"," I'm not joking here. "
"6534400","6536560"," Scott said he sold his puts for a loss."
"6537460","6538940"," Did you lose that ton on him, Scott?"
"6539340","6543320"," Or why did, uh, tell us about your management in the chat?"
"6543320","6548280"," Like, let's say pretend, you don't have to tell us exactly what you paid, but did you pay a dollar"
"6548280","6549760"," and then sell him a 10 cents?"
"6550480","6554920"," Did you pay a dollar or pretend, I don't know what you paid, but like, you know, could you buy"
"6554920","6557020"," them for a dollar and sell them at 60 cents?"
"6557180","6557760"," You have a ripboard."
"6558380","6566060"," You're going to pull or did you, um, did you not just say it sometimes when I lose a trade,"
"6566760","6570360"," say I think a dollar trade and it goes down to 10 cents, I'll just leave them on. "
"6571400","6575740"," Other times I'll leave them on and I'll buy higher strikes or lower strikes."
"6576480","6582640"," Uh, and if we do end up going in the direction that I originally planned, uh, then try to monetize"
"6582640","6583260"," all that stuff."
"6584000","6587320"," I try to like flip green roll, basically rolling. "
"6590500","6594140"," You paid a dollar 20 for 50 and 80 cents for 50."
"6594380","6596180"," How far down are they though now?"
"6598420","6599420"," That's not too bad."
"6599860","6600620"," That's not too bad. "
"6601680","6602740"," Oh, it's not zero."
"6602820","6603400"," It's not a penny."
"6604620","6606880"," You see, I do have on this stream. "
"6607060","6612120"," I've had fucking trades go straight to goddamn zero on this on this stream because I'm so fucking"
"6612120","6613260"," angry when it gets that low."
"6614160","6616240"," I'm just like, well, fucking now it's 10 to 10 cents."
"6616260","6618140"," So smiles, I'll just leave them on. "
"6618300","6620380"," Let them go to zero in case something else that crazy happens."
"6672610","6673970"," Let's take a little test really quick."
"6673970","6686810"," I think you're"
"6686810","6686990"," fine. "
"6687090","6689530"," Scott, I think it's, I think you did great trade management, man."
"6691050","6692510"," I think you did great trade management."
"6692750","6694010"," Plus you can get closer in the money too. "
"6694330","6695550"," Uh, I think, I think that was good trade."
"6695770","6699430"," Even with the loss, even with the L, I think 36 cents is not so bad."
"6700550","6701650"," Uh, I think it did pretty good. "
"6702730","6703410"," Seems reasonable."
"6707960","6709480"," So let me show you got our hair."
"6709880","6710660"," We need a tassel here. "
"6718190","6730880"," Um, what"
"6730880","6735000"," I'm watching here is there's somewhat."
"6736580","6739440"," Problem here is that, well, I like this structure here."
"6740720","6742620"," I like how price is rounding. "
"6743280","6746860"," I like how there's a slowing of the hourly trigger."
"6748360","6753040"," I like this squeeze and I like this squeeze, but we're not able to get above right now."
"6753640","6757560"," So I'm in some calls here to try to see if this happens at the end of the day. "
"6758340","6760620"," You know, get attached that turn."
"6761380","6763340"," I don't know that I want zero dates."
"6763680","6768820"," So I took 126 and they've got an ER coming up. "
"6769040","6772400"," So I'm hoping to grab some of that ER premium."
"6777190","6778430"," They're cheap anyways."
"6778930","6782390"," So now the problem is we start rolling the shit down. "
"6784930","6787270"," Well, I got no thesis down here."
"6787450","6788770"," It's all skull and crossbones."
"6790510","6792890"," I got zero thesis below here. "
"6793570","6799530"," What I should be doing that I'm not that I haven't done is I should be looking for this action"
"6799530","6799990"," here."
"6800430","6801350"," It should be."
"6801890","6805710"," I should be looking for basically for that. "
"6807950","6809570"," You know, something like that, right?"
"6810470","6812470"," You know, something with a turn going on."
"6817190","6818530"," Seriously, stop that."
"6819190","6820790"," Oh, god, killing me. "
"6821510","6822030"," All right, fine."
"6822150","6822810"," Is that what you want to do?"
"6824010","6827250"," This is it this looks this is not right, but you get the gist, right?"
"6828570","6831210"," That I want to see this I want to see price above."
"6834130","6835870"," This is the safe trade right here. "
"6836690","6840690"," Waiting price to sit above this hourly trigger, but we're not there yet."
"6840690","6842550"," So I shouldn't be taking this trade."
"6843210","6845710"," I'm lucky to get likely going to get stopped out of this for taking it. "
"6845850","6847190"," So early until this happens."
"6850350","6854770"," Well, I'm only up a penny right now, so I'm not doing so hot in this trade right now."
"6856830","6858650"," Okay, I don't want to get rolled in this trade. "
"6865360","6866740"," Playing a game of chicken here."
"6871580","6872580"," It's very risky."
"6888500","6891060"," All right, so I'm sitting in a Tesla trade right now. "
"6891180","6892200"," I'm not in anything on spy."
"6892900","6898060"," I'm looking for an entry into put spread for the 31st."
"6898320","6899200"," Still haven't found that yet. "
"6905200","6906500"," So I got no dice there."
"6908380","6910900"," Yeah, 235 into ER."
"6913320","6914260"," 86 cents. "
"6914480","6915540"," How much think those things will be worth?"
"6921940","6926380"," I got some put spread set up here on spy."
"6926600","6927300"," I haven't bought them yet."
"6927680","6930300"," They're 600 there are five long put 500. "
"6931420","6933940"," And short put 490."
"6935780","6944500"," So 500, 490 costs right now is currently $620, pays $380, dated for May 17th."
"6946220","6948800"," I bet I'm going to put those on at the end of the day. "
"6949040","6953440"," If I had to guess like taking a shot in the dark, not thinking about anything, then I'll be able"
"6953440","6955820"," to place those at like four o'clock in the afternoon or something."
"6978920","6980660"," I think that's a great trade."
"6981040","6981820"," I mean, think about that. "
"6981980","6985460"," How many trades do you take that don't print 50% or 60%?"
"6986520","6990300"," I think that put spread trade is fairly a fairly good trade."
"6990640","6992160"," Everybody likes action, right?"
"6992420","6993980"," Everybody wants the cocaine fueled trades."
"6994900","6999300"," And this one right here though that put spread right there is kind of like the boring trade, right?"
"6999420","7000420"," You place it and forget it. "
"7003080","7004840"," Come on, maybe hold this one minute trigger."
"7005400","7007800"," Hold this one minute trigger here on Tesla."
"7009160","7011940"," Come on, hold it, hold it. "
"7015800","7019700"," We're retesting the one in five minute right now for more blood to the downside."
"7022420","7025280"," If we can't hold this one minute trigger, I'm going to cut this trade loose."
"7040700","7042300"," That would be a new low too. "
"7042820","7089040"," I'll be looking at trade 207.90 currently at 209.27. We"
"7089040","7090560"," should look at that right now."
"7090880","7092940"," I wanted to show you guys something about Tesla here."
"7094840","7096500"," Well, we're going to talk Tesla really quick. "
"7096860","7097760"," How do I do this?"
"7098520","7099240"," Hold on here."
"7103680","7104640"," Unnamed Tesla."
"7118390","7120110"," Let me go over here and do this. "
"7120850","7128490"," Here's a Tesla chart, a volume chart, I'm going to delete this volume chart and just show you"
"7132630","7135090"," something here in Tesla's daily chart on spy."
"7137490","7139710"," And what do I want to show you on Tesla?"
"7139710","7149980"," So, same price"
"7149980","7150480"," and scale."
"7151340","7151980"," Does that work?"
"7160830","7162830"," This is probably a good way to show it. "
"7163050","7163790"," Nope, hold on here."
"7168130","7170210"," This one might be not too bad right here."
"7170290","7171010"," It's a good way. "
"7171170","7172750"," Oh, hold on right there."
"7177510","7180190"," Tesla can have divergences, right?"
"7180530","7181630"," So this is Tesla and spy."
"7184250","7188610"," You see like the outsized down move on Tesla. "
"7188970","7190190"," The orange is Tesla by the way."
"7190250","7191530"," You see the divergences."
"7192950","7195450"," But then Tesla comes screaming back. "
"7196810","7198410"," Like nothing ever happened."
"7198890","7200290"," So it's like an outsized down move."
"7200490","7201450"," Same thing down here, right?"
"7201970","7202810"," Outsized down move. "
"7203870","7205210"," But then it screams back."
"7206330","7209750"," And we have another divergence right here, right?"
"7209750","7211670"," Where you see spoos going up."
"7211950","7214970"," And you see that I have virgins and spoos or in Tesla. "
"7215390","7218530"," So the idea here would be do you get that squeeze back up?"
"7221570","7223270"," That's my only thought here on Tesla."
"7223550","7225650"," It's my only thesis that I've got here for the bulls."
"7225910","7227730"," If I had a thesis for the bulls, that's it. "
"7227930","7228290"," That's it."
"7229870","7231310"," Now there's a problem with that thesis."
"7232470","7233550"," But you know what the problem is?"
"7234370","7238270"," The last little bit on Tesla tends to be a fucking blood bath. "
"7238770","7239950"," I mean like a blood bath."
"7240170","7244530"," Like we're going to rain down to 160 straight line down at the depths of hell."
"7245730","7247850"," And then you get that sideways and ramp. "
"7248290","7252630"," It already reminds me of a UVX or even VIX."
"7260010","7263310"," So how many times have I traded?"
"7265790","7267930"," How many times have I traded VIX?"
"7267930","7268850"," I don't trade VIX anymore."
"7269230","7270870"," But how many times have I traded VIX?"
"7276940","7278700"," How many times have I traded VIX?"
"7278920","7281160"," And I've been directionally right. "
"7282360","7285100"," And I've been spoofed in the options chain, right?"
"7285580","7288100"," Or we get there and by the time we get there, it's worthless."
"7288880","7290280"," Just took all my money in the options chain."
"7290800","7292920"," We hit the target and I got nothing. "
"7293160","7293860"," I might like zero."
"7299640","7300580"," Yeah, pure pain."
"7308620","7309760"," Still sitting in these calls. "
"7310760","7311740"," We'd have to lose."
"7312120","7312620"," I've got a top."
"7312940","7321140"," So I've got a, I wrote a, I drew in a box down here at 20780,"
"7321920","7323760"," 20796. "
"7325800","7327380"," We start breaking that up."
"7327500","7327720"," I'll cut loose."
"7327980","7328600"," That's my stop. "
"7330120","7331660"," Probably shouldn't have said that publicly."
"7336200","7338980"," That's my stop basically on Tesla."
"7339760","7347840"," I'm going to play, I'm going to play, have a stand off here with put holders"
"7347840","7350880"," on Tesla. "
"7355050","7357310"," What's the success rate of my Tesla call?"
"7358150","7359130"," A hundred percent."
"7361190","7362450"," Literally a hundred percent."
"7363270","7365870"," A hundred percent. "
"7367110","7368710"," But I haven't made a Tesla call yet."
"7368710","7373450"," So I'm waiting for minus 50 on a Velo."
"7373630","7374410"," We're not there yet. "
"7375090","7379150"," A hundred percent on Tesla."
"7380030","7381090"," Not a single L."
"7381410","7382230"," Wasn't that fucked up?"
"7386430","7388290"," But this isn't a Tesla call."
"7388510","7390370"," So this is just me putting some risk on early. "
"7391270","7393410"," I'm trying to time it before it happens."
"7393850","7397510"," I need minus 50 for that call on daily Velo on Tesla."
"7398090","7399430"," To make that a valid call. "
"7402370","7404970"," Like if I was like I'm breaking my rules right now."
"7405850","7406730"," Good question."
"7406870","7407550"," Who asked that question?"
"7408030","7408550"," A green man. "
"7410270","7411430"," A hundred percent man."
"7411650","7416890"," If we hit minus 50 or more on daily velocity on Tesla, I'm buying that fucking dip every time."
"7417230","7418050"," Every single time. "
"7419330","7420690"," Every single time."
"7444970","7452570"," I'm coming back down here to test 4800 on SPX here."
"7466350","7468550"," HYG just looking like dog shit. "
"7468930","7472270"," Divergence and XYG by the way."
"7473590","7475210"," HYG showing bearishness."
"7476930","7482950"," It disagrees with the price of Spooze right now. "
"7483670","7484690"," Vicks getting murdered."
"7485810","7487350"," Tesla just putting around here."
"7496980","7499800"," Now's Zach with a little bit of a roll going on on a one minute basis. "
"7501140","7502640"," T and X looking bullish right here."
"7503960","7505720"," Watch out for a downside move."
"7508640","7512000"," Down three pennies on a Tesla trade for their ER. "
"7551720","7554260"," I'm going to get stopped out soon on Tesla here."
"7555580","7565600"," Not quite there just yet, but I do not want to see a new low going back to 438"
"7565600","7566440"," this morning."
"7623150","7624670"," Just watching here in the background. "
"7624770","7626230"," Just watching this Tesla trade."
"7664820","7666640"," Down six on that Tesla trade."
"7668240","7672540"," Sitting on January 26th, 235C. "
"7724740","7726060"," These sellers, man."
"7726300","7727700"," It's 11.42 in the afternoon."
"7727700","7734840"," We get the start of a one hour period from 11.30 to 12.30. These fucking sellers are coming"
"7734840","7736960"," out for blood on Tesla right now. "
"7766310","7770910"," Looking to see if they get the new low on the 438 buy this morning."
"7847740","7850980"," I'm being given a chance to exit here before a blood bath."
"7873060","7875760"," Just half our bear or bar right here, man. "
"7875900","7877460"," They are trying right now."
"7878420","7882220"," Looking at a 30 minute basis, there's a huge reversal candle here."
"7883160","7887120"," One, two red candles in decision. "
"7888360","7890660"," And then another red candle here."
"7890740","7891860"," It's pretty fucking bearish."
"7892500","7893960"," I'm trying to make a new low right now. "
"7936700","7937820"," Still long Tesla."
"7943840","7944360"," Good morning."
"7944460","7944900"," How's everybody doing?"
"7945020","7946140"," How are you doing out there recovering alcohol?"
"7946140","7947500"," How are you doing?"
"7950540","7956280"," Yeah, they're running a stop on me right now. "
"7956400","7958460"," They're trying to stop me out right here."
"7960120","7962080"," You can see the stop hunts right now."
"7962420","7964080"," This is all stop hunting action. "
"7967500","7972080"," I'll cut loose if we break for the low at four o'clock this morning."
"7975390","7977190"," See if those buyers are still there."
"7990980","7991800"," Almost there. "
"7994380","7995680"," It's this bar right here."
"7995800","7997020"," Watch us test this right now."
"7999100","8000260"," See that right there?"
"8000560","8001820"," See that blast down right there?"
"8003200","8004840"," Watch that big red bar. "
"8006840","8008700"," They're pulling people's stops right here."
"8020760","8022700"," I just added another 10 right there."
"8066520","8068660"," 11 47 13 minutes left. "
"8069100","8072600"," Bear is getting a new low on Tesla on the day."
"8073160","8075860"," It's pretty fucking bearish not looking good here for Tesla."
"8076500","8080760"," Trading 207 on the low 207 55. "
"8082600","8086500"," It's not looking good for bulls here at all getting that new low."
"8086660","8087580"," It's pretty bearish here."
"8090710","8091610"," Damn Tesla. "
"8093710","8095970"," We'll look at nasty here in Tesla."
"8096550","8099300"," Full rejection on the hourly trigger above at 212 18."
"8102430","8110510"," New low on the day on Tesla back to minus 30 on Tesla. "
"8112810","8114710"," I think I'm in the right track here though."
"8115150","8115970"," I'm going to leave these on."
"8116210","8121590"," I'm not going to focus on this right now. "
"8123270","8125270"," I think I might leave these on."
"8126090","8129770"," I don't know that I'm believing any of this price action here still."
"8130430","8133550"," I believe it, but I think we're still reversing to the upside. "
"8135070","8136710"," I think these stay on."
"8139730","8142070"," And I don't like the fucking new low though."
"8145670","8147930"," Definitely do not like the new low here. "
"8150570","8152750"," It's all screaming fucking super bear."
"8166530","8169170"," It's still long added another 10 pack on there."
"8169750","8173110"," So I'm just going to hang tight on this and I'm not going to do anything else. "
"8173190","8174090"," I'm just going to sit on my hands."
"8187570","8193410"," Yeah, I'm not I was I was pretty bearish on Tesla up until this moment, but on Friday here I"
"8193410","8194170"," want to see all these."
"8194389","8201910"," I want to see them close these puts as the day progresses here and not hold them fucking hold them"
"8201910","8204830"," direct into close but they might do that. "
"8204850","8209490"," I'm hoping that some of that gamma comes off at least into the bell and into the end of the"
"8209490","8210150"," day here in Tesla."
"8210549","8213910"," Some kind of an unclench on like you I'm looking for the unclench on spoos."
"8214150","8216930"," I'm also looking for an unclench on Tesla as well here. "
"8217490","8220350"," It's been so fucking it's been shorted into the depths of hell."
"8233100","8238700"," Yeah, so I'm I'm looking for a crazy high this quarter."
"8240280","8247080"," I'm bullish on the quarter making a high, but I'm looking for it to start in the beginning of"
"8247080","8249760"," January, not not today. "
"8249920","8252299"," I'm expecting it in the middle of January or February."
"8252340","8253059"," Excuse me."
"8253740","8254820"," I'm bullish here. "
"8255180","8264120"," So so ready."
"8265340","8267799"," I'm bearish after today."
"8268700","8275660"," For consolidation, okay, some bearish, but I am overall bullish for a move higher into February"
"8275660","8276660"," 14th. "
"8278280","8279299"," Does that make sense?"
"8280260","8286340"," So I'm trying to get a put spread into the close today to protect the downside for the next couple"
"8286340","8289080"," of weeks and then I'm looking for a ramp to the upside."
"8289580","8294500"," Now, meanwhile, tech should trade sideways, no meaningful downside move."
"8294959","8301660"," That's why though I'm expecting a little bit of weakness into the 31st and then I'm looking for a"
"8301660","8303639"," ramp to more than all-time highs. "
"8304280","8312420"," I'm looking for like a nice, a nice, meaningful rip, possibly to five thousand quarter five."
"8312580","8315059"," We're not there, but slightly lower than it."
"8321400","8324240"," I guess you got to ask me on what time frame I bullish and bearish. "
"8324719","8326280"," And what am I bullish and bearish on?"
"8337440","8343780"," I'm looking at Tesla chain right now because I'm long, but that's not a bad idea, bro."
"8348299","8351360"," Like pin the close, grab some put spreads."
"8352139","8358959"," I'm thinking here like long Tesla and if there's an unclunched into the close, it goes up, but it"
"8358959","8359980"," could get pinned too. "
"8359980","8364959"," They could pin Tesla right in a, like they pin Tesla today and then when the move comes on Monday."
"8372219","8372900"," Not much."
"8373020","8374299"," I got much for you guys today. "
"8394330","8395810"," Are you got a poll today, Joe?"
"8397530","8398990"," I didn't see that poll, man."
"8399190","8401370"," So Joe Donut posted a poll in Twitch."
"8402310","8404390"," When do you typically exit a trade and profit?"
"8405630","8406930"," That's a good question too. "
"8406930","8412850"," You know, it's really weird is like spreads, we drink some coffee here."
"8417430","8421650"," That's a good question, Joe asks, so like spreads?"
"8423750","8432030"," A lot of the time I end up taking profit at 50% of whatever the profit should be."
"8432310","8434870"," So it's like a dollar trade for two dollars. "
"8435190","8436270"," I try to get out of the dollar."
"8436270","8439410"," If it's a dollar trade for four dollars, I try to get out of two dollars."
"8442030","8449610"," Not always, but a lot of times I'll be in profit to like 50% in the beginning of the"
"8449610","8449850"," trade. "
"8451110","8456550"," And then I don't see the other 50% until the end of the trade."
"8457530","8464650"," It's like time-based profit and I could make better or trades that pay quicker before you ever get"
"8464650","8465490"," to the expiry."
"8468450","8474050"," Sometimes I'll hit like 100% profit before you ever get to the time part of it, but a lot"
"8474050","8475890"," of times that's not the case. "
"8476250","8481270"," So I like to exit at 50% if possible."
"8482070","8482910"," It's a good question, man."
"8485580","8487440"," Spoons turning around on the upside right now. "
"8488300","8491220"," Jimmy Barry was out there telling you to buy 26 cent to 480 calls."
"8493280","8495740"," We're not telling you to, but telling you how cheap they were."
"8503780","8506020"," You turn on CMBCC what they're saying. "
"8521900","8525640"," Yeah, Jimmy Barry popped in and said 480 of C's were 27 cents."
"8525860","8526920"," Spiced it in last week's high."
"8527100","8528200"," If they can hold, we're going up. "
"8528900","8530480"," Must be the weekly high from last week."
"8530700","8532320"," Yeah, 480 looks great, man."
"8532520","8535680"," The gamma on 480 is being established at least. "
"8537040","8538600"," Morning, David AMS. How are you?"
"8538600","8539040"," How are you, man?"
"8539240","8540020"," Happy holidays, brother."
"8540020","8541560"," How's that holiday coming along?"
"8566400","8571740"," Do I have a daily max on how many day trades I do?"
"8572100","8572240"," No. "
"8573000","8573720"," Fuck no."
"8576400","8582140"," Do I limit the trades that I take on a day trading?"
"8582560","8582580"," Never."
"8583040","8584280"," It's a really bad habit. "
"8585480","8588600"," It's a habit that's built to make you fail."
"8589380","8592960"," If I enter the wrong side of a trade, exit."
"8594920","8597660"," I try to think before I place any trade. "
"8599240","8601340"," No, I don't always adhere to my own rules."
"8602720","8610700"," There's a part of my trading that where my experience or time and market takes over and says, nope,"
"8610960","8613900"," I'm going against my rules and my tools."
"8615660","8617920"," I can lose, though, that way, too. "
"8618200","8619980"," So there's a lot of risk doing that."
"8620240","8623800"," But time and market, sometimes I will stay in a trade."
"8623940","8627800"," But let's say I take a trade and it's going against me. "
"8628220","8637160"," I have already pre-planned where those cuts are made, where I take the L, where I DCA."
"8637620","8641660"," What I don't do is stay in a conviction trade."
"8643400","8645720"," What I don't do is stay in a conviction trade. "
"8647420","8653780"," If it begins to break through my DCAs or where I'm supposed to be cutting that kind of stuff."
"8657500","8666020"," What you're saying to me reminds me a lot of what happens to people that are under what is it"
"8666020","8670080"," called there when you haven't spent a long time."
"8673580","8678460"," The under $25,000, well, how many trades you can take in a day rules?"
"8679480","8685180"," Those are built from their perspective, so that you take a trade that you've planned out. "
"8685880","8690860"," But in reality, if the trade's going against you, you should get out anyways, right?"
"8691900","8693360"," Your PDT rules?"
"8693660","8695100"," Yeah, exactly, PDT rules."
"8695580","8698160"," PDT rules are in theory good."
"8700340","8707560"," But I oftentimes you'll meet someone that's like, well, I'm under PDT, so I'm going to stay in the"
"8707560","8707780"," trade. "
"8709060","8711220"," Fuck no, burn that account."
"8711600","8713160"," PDT rules and go somewhere else."
"8713740","8715100"," ACH or money somewhere else. "
"8718420","8720460"," I don't know, I think I'm tasty."
"8720780","8724960"," I was told you can trade a cash account on tasty, multiple cash accounts."
"8725680","8728500"," So you break PDT rules, you can jump into account. "
"8729320","8732920"," I wouldn't stay in the trade."
"8733960","8737920"," Capital preservation amongst every like rules period."
"8739120","8740320"," It's like rule number one. "
"8740980","8743420"," Capital preservation rule number two."
"8744220","8751020"," Make sure that capital preservation is always making or beating inflation 5% right now."
"8751660","8753040"," It's rule number two. "
"8753720","8760900"," Rule number three, only trade profits from any monies that you're making from principle or capital."
"8761960","8763860"," Never ever trade that capital."
"8764540","8770520"," Rule number five, it always rules leading up into the actual trade. "
"8774420","8776520"," I thought there are PDT rules on cash."
"8777800","8778960"," I can be wrong in that."
"8779060","8781860"," I think you get flagged if you take too many pd. "
"8782060","8783540"," I think you get flagged still."
"8787420","8788480"," Yeah, raise your back."
"8788680","8791540"," So there's no limit to how many, my point here, raise your back is. "
"8792260","8796700"," When I when I turn in my taxes every year, it's a fucking mess."
"8798120","8799920"," I've I've traded on this show."
"8800860","8803460"," I've made on the show 30 trades, 40 trades in a day. "
"8803960","8808920"," Like adding to positions, exiting positions, 30 trades in a day."
"8811160","8811540"," Seriously."
"8815140","8820940"," Still long here, trade 81 down 5 cents on tassel right now. "
"8827770","8828910"," I'm serious."
"8831030","8833610"," So I've printed it out before for my time."
"8833610","8839190"," I've actually literally I've actually printed out my trades at the end of a year. "
"8839730","8840130"," You ready?"
"8840270","8840670"," I'm not joking."
"8842770","8844070"," That thick of paper."
"8846930","8852010"," I've done that like printed out my whole year of transactions. "
"8853250","8855630"," It's like a thick fucking thing."
"8855750","8858410"," A book that's not joking at all."
"8865990","8866970"," It ain't pretty. "
"8868510","8873010"," Dude, I've got stories like so I got stories."
"8874890","8880990"," My so my my our family personal banking about twice a year."
"8881530","8888050"," The boys down there try to get my wife to talk me into coming down to have them manage my"
"8888050","8893530"," money and then my wife begs me and I show up and they're they're like sharks. "
"8894070","8895230"," I kid you how this how it goes."
"8895510","8899330"," I go in the office right and there's like they have desks."
"8900050","8904410"," There's like a you don't really get a private cubicle if you're in the if you're in the pit. "
"8905330","8910650"," They have like a semi private desk and these guys all have their series 7 or whatever and my wife"
"8910650","8910990"," will drive."
"8911270","8912810"," I kid you not my wife drags me down there."
"8913170","8919510"," I sit down and my wife my wife has some of her money managed and they sit me down and"
"8919510","8925670"," they're like like literally like so you like to invest in the stock market. "
"8925870","8927470"," How your wife's been telling me about this."
"8931410","8932730"," Are you licensed?"
"8933730","8933810"," No."
"8936590","8942210"," Do you want to show us your history and see if we can work on it with you?"
"8942310","8942790"," I kid you not. "
"8942950","8944410"," This is like how these conversations go."
"8944410","8949870"," Meanwhile, I've been having these conversations right with a financial advisor."
"8950130","8950870"," I show you not. "
"8951330","8958450"," I watch the other ones hovering around like making passes by the desk."
"8959710","8964470"," Guys like literally like drinking a cup of coffee and watching me from across the room."
"8965190","8965950"," It's true story. "
"8972290","8977430"," And I already know that about I was talking to a buddy I was saying to Joe done it the"
"8977430","8981850"," other day and I'm like they already know that you're like pulling money in and out and stuff."
"8981890","8983150"," They're watching all your shit."
"8983330","8984290"," They know what you're doing. "
"8986470","8990570"," Like I'll ACH money into that account ACH money out of that account."
"8991390","8992530"," They know what I'm doing."
"8992870","8994030"," They know where the money's going. "
"8997090","8998450"," This fucking true story."
"9000890","9003270"," So now I don't go as much as I used to."
"9003890","9005350"," I used to humor my wife. "
"9006070","9009990"," I'm assuming at this point I'll get a call this spring."
"9011390","9013250"," You're doing it wrong Mr. James."
"9018390","9019890"," Has any of you ever encountered this?"
"9020070","9026370"," Have any of you brought your has anybody in this stream ever been asked by their banks financial"
"9026370","9027770"," advisors to come on down?"
"9028750","9031690"," Have they ever asked you to provide your investment history?"
"9032730","9033230"," Anyone?"
"9033490","9034210"," Am I the only one?"
"9042670","9044510"," I'm paraphrasing you're doing it wrong. "
"9049970","9051750"," You got a flag for two minutes."
"9051950","9053610"," I've gotten that letter too."
"9054470","9061770"," Matter of fact another buddy showed me a screenshot of his bank telling him they were concerned"
"9061770","9064690"," about him and I was like I've gotten one of those before. "
"9064990","9068590"," It was for it was for trading on a prime bank account."
"9076370","9078390"," Your behavior is disturbing."
"9079470","9080350"," Yeah it is. "
"9084020","9086160"," Oh yeah my tax guy doesn't say anything."
"9086800","9089480"," We joked about it a few times but now it's just regular."
"9091000","9092800"," My tax guy with no problems. "
"9097580","9099880"," My tax guy has laughed at me too."
"9101700","9103160"," Some of my worst losses."
"9103640","9104020"," Oh yeah. "
"9112790","9114550"," Hold on I'm gonna give you an update right now."
"9115290","9120210"," David AMS I'm going to read some what David AMS is saying."
"9120310","9122330"," If you're on Twitch here this is an update for you guys. "
"9123130","9125190"," This is a friend of what we do here right."
"9125350","9128650"," This is a guy that works inside of the discord guy that works with our community."
"9129650","9138130"," His name is David AMS and he is saying I have some levels above I want to see on NQ. "
"9139270","9141350"," For a few hundred points to go."
"9143610","9147230"," Personally trading ranges not holding longs over the weekend."
"9148230","9150930"," Potential thank god it's Friday set up forming. "
"9154760","9159140"," He's also saying 17 400 on NQ is the target."
"9160880","9164580"," Oh Jared King Rumbald saying I get the bank invite every year."
"9165040","9166420"," Yeah I wasn't showing up to him. "
"9166480","9170600"," My wife was they started pushing my wife into talking to me in person."
"9170600","9173440"," Like my wife like we need to sit you down and have an intervention."
"9176840","9180940"," David AMS saying but for now I closed my lungs at 267. "
"9183760","9187000"," So David giving us an update on his upside expectations on today."
"9187140","9192260"," The pinning action into the clothes which is what I'm afraid of is some kind of a pinning action"
"9192260","9197740"," into the bell and then like grabbing a put spread at like 412 or some shit."
"9200720","9202900"," Like parking the fucking bus on a Friday. "
"9206280","9215250"," I'm with David on that and I'm looking for those fucking that fucking put."
"9215710","9220590"," Like goddamn fucking put mark or gamma on the market just roll the fuck off on Tesla and the"
"9220590","9221150"," clothes here."
"9222990","9225470"," Like we'll print your puts we're going to print them lower. "
"9226170","9230990"," If I was a dealer that's what I'd be saying right there's no more downside risk."
"9230990","9233950"," I'm going to start annihilating those puts on Tesla."
"9235370","9237910"," That's that's my thesis here in Tesla today. "
"9238050","9240870"," So I don't know when or if that half actually happens or not."
"9242130","9243670"," It might happen on Monday."
"9244850","9246990"," So maybe it's Monday that I get paid. "
"9251740","9253260"," Hey what's going on trainer podcast?"
"9253580","9253840"," How you doing?"
"9257120","9259180"," We were just talking about our tax accounting."
"9260580","9261540"," Tax bookkeeping."
"9263780","9267560"," Financial advisors trying to drag us in the office nobody in this stream. "
"9268560","9274600"," Not a single one of you has ever gotten an email from your prime bank saying we're concerned about"
"9274600","9275440"," your trading behavior."
"9276240","9282360"," None of you had a financial advisor trying to get you to at least let them manage some of your"
"9282360","9282600"," money."
"9283800","9285340"," Never really one with this. "
"9290890","9292770"," I guess I'm the only one with this."
"9297590","9300910"," Yeah rocket surgeon saying I've had a transfer of funds in my brokerage account."
"9301390","9304130"," And I have data because I used on some funds on a zero data close. "
"9304190","9304590"," Nice."
"9309110","9309670"," That's cool."
"9309890","9313010"," Momo is saying he has an FA that he leaves me alone as I need him. "
"9314510","9318990"," I think it's a good thing to have a financial advisor if you like if you're thinking about trading"
"9318990","9322970"," or investing and bouncing off whatever your thesis is off your financial advisor."

"10447120","10454800"," there's a reason for that and explain why okay you shouldn't be following my trades so the reason"
"10454800","10463560"," you shouldn't be following my trades is because you're likely not following all of my trades so"
"10463560","10468480"," you're like a lot of times you can follow just one or two of my trades you have a loser"

"10514700","10523200"," you see putting on your own risk on the market"
"10523200","10531140"," and managing your own risk on the market so i want to say that to you guys i'm posting right"

"10588180","10594980"," down six cents do you get what i'm saying there uh i want you to be taking your own trade"
"10594980","10601640"," so that you can manage you have to think about uh what your risk is what you're willing to risk"
"10601640","10608240"," uh you'll have to take into consideration for you like you're your own individual you should be out"

"14213370","14216370"," some time We've touched on it briefly."
"14216670","14223670"," We used to touch on it a lot And uh, we talked about like if you if you understand anything"
"14223670","14232830"," about distribution the theory Uh wack off wack off wacken off theory that kind of stuff Uh it"
"14232830","14244710"," matters If we get the all-time high and spx Turn this down here It"
"14244710","14254590"," matters If we fail to get the all-time high Or if we do get the all-time high"
"14254590","14260150"," and then just back check Rather than checking the entire trough behind us if any of you understand"
"14260150","14268590"," this stuff on a more macro level Um, this is very positive for bulls Now we can still roll down"
"14268590","14274390"," and reject and go way lower to the bottom of the trough there are examples of that happening But"
"14274390","14279890"," when you get all-time highs like this, uh, there's an expectation that we're going to add a minimum"
"14280330","14289870"," Trade much higher and then come back down and retest the this level right here This becomes Uh a"
"14289870","14296310"," level that we back test Uh, and then we start to back test the trough behind us And it begins"
"14296310","14303070"," to give begins to give a much larger clearer view Uh on which distribution model is ahead for us. "
"14303130","14309250"," There are likely some bears out there right now Uh that are that are into that kind of stuff and"
"14309250","14319710"," are questioning Uh what the path for it is for us for price right now in sp500 I'll"
"14319710","14324950"," get you guys a little thing here you can how about on your own If you understand the basics of"
"14324950","14330370"," this theory, um Uh, let me see if they can show you the basics of it."
"14330610","14336390"," So with number on the on the first part here Uh, you have distribution, right you have like an i'll"
"14336390","14340110"," do it really slow you get tend to pretend this is an all-time high in a stock ticker, right?"
"14341810","14344610"," And uh, you have the the distribution phase."
"14344910","14350390"," Let's say down here Uh, and then you come back up here and you never want to have that uh,"
"14350550","14355850"," uh, failure here You really want to have well actually that I should step back a little bit I'm"
"14355850","14360470"," trying to i'm really hacking this up right now on the fly here Uh, you have the bottoming action"
"14360470","14360710"," here. "
"14360710","14367110"," This is your trough Uh, then you come back up here and you never want that failure here Uh, you"
"14367110","14371930"," end up getting usually a second leg down over here So what you really look you're really looking"
"14371930","14377750"," for if you're a bull is you're looking for the break above That's your first good sign Uh, the"
"14377750","14382610"," retest which this would be called a touch and go And you're just off and running you never look"
"14382610","14389230"," back on this trough Uh, usually you'll retest that trough if you fail the all-time high and even"
"14389230","14394910"," make it leg lower possibly Uh, so usually we should blast way high up here once we get that all "
"14394910","14401570","-time high now when we back test this oftentimes even if we fail this Even if we fail this, uh,"
"14402050","14406730"," this part right here we come up here blast up And if we even if we do back test and"
"14406730","14412470"," fail it we never really come back down the full way It's like right here that we come back down"
"14412470","14417370"," then we fight and fight and fight to get back up and continue up into the right And it also"
"14417370","14426890"," sets up the modeling for, um, uh for, uh, wack off distribution models So I will uh, I will"
"14426890","14436810"," post you a link for you on your own To review And you"
"14436810","14442530"," tell me what you think Because I've already written my yearly expectations using those models."
"14442770","14447170"," I'll show you my models Uh, and what I think about it here in just a minute."
"14447230","14456170"," So I'm gonna first post this to you Uh, here we go I'm gonna post the link to, uh, simplified"
"14457110","14458470"," Uh, this is just simplified. "
"14458850","14468790"," I believe it's from stock charts calm You can review that I'm gonna I'll show you what model"
"14468790","14473930"," I think we are in Now we didn't make all time highs when I wrote this report, uh, but I"
"14473930","14478390"," did say this is what I think which model I think we're in Uh, it's not the model the model"
"14478390","14486530"," that bears want to see They don't want to see this model this model is, um This model predicts that"
"14486530","14494230"," we don't crash until like 26 or 20 um 2026 if we Are actually doing this right now."
"14494230","14515320"," So It's not it's not bearish How"
"14515320","14520040"," long before we retest I don't know I just strap in on some zeridates and the money If they go"
"14520040","14530240"," if they flip down I'd fucking jump higher and keep trading you're gonna make bank Yeah, whack"
"14530240","14540120"," off models Come on tesla baby testing out trading"
"14540120","14550380"," a dollar oh one Come on tesla reverse Tessa"
"14550380","14551400"," and i'll come back to test."

"14559000","14563420"," is weakening the reset or the resistance On that hourly trigger is weakening. "
"14564000","14569700"," So i'm hoping for a squeeze above a break above and a hold above Trying to make a move to"
"14569700","14576900"," the upside right now and tesla spoos just melting up climbing the wall of worry trying to establish"
"14577480","14583720"," Uh, right if you got big over here real quick So right over here you can see this gamma level"
"14583720","14589380"," right here, right You got to see that gamma level 80 million gamma level right there, right?"
"14589960","14600580"," And we're trying to trade Squeeze all the way up here and trade 4850 And just"
"14600580","14605720"," melt straight to the top so as long as we're above this yellow box right here We are rock and"
"14605720","14617700"," roll to the upside of the mint and from a momentum perspective What i'm doing here main screen Am"

"18690870","18696310"," I'm bearish into the 31st No, not a not a bunch, but I am bearish. "
"18696710","18703630"," I'm looking for a consolidation move slightly sideways and down and spy and i'm expecting a"
"18704390","18713410"," respecting a cues to bounce around sideways with defined top and bottom Sideways action for cues"
"18713410","18720050"," spy to be sideways and slightly down I'm not looking for the crash that everybody else is looking"
"18720050","18729610"," for and I understand I from a thesis point of view respect uh The idea that we're coming into a"
"18729610","18730450"," correction now."
"18730550","18737790"," I understand And the thesis is behind that I agree with Or I agree that it's valid those statements"
"18737790","18739130"," that are being made right now."
"18739530","18746810"," I agree that there's an unclenching I agree that there is a window of weakness Um, I don't agree"
"18746810","18754430"," though that the window of weakness always translates the downside moves Uh, I also know that"
"18754430","18761130"," there's a rotation going on successfully from market breadth And we're not in any kind of a"
"18761130","18768710"," liquidation phase in this in in these sub sectors of the s&p 500 complex as of right now So"
"18768710","18775450"," i'm going to lean towards consolidate and have some slight pain Uh into next week. "
"18775470","18784990"," So personally uh for me I have to construct a trade right for that thesis And so what i'm looking"
"18784990","18788710"," at is um I'm saying to myself."
"18788930","18794050"," Yeah, you know what, uh, I think we still pull back into the 31st at the minimum if we crash"
"18794670","18803350"," or doom I can cash in, uh, uh, conservative put spread right Uh, what's another thing that I can"
"18803350","18803530"," do?"
"18804070","18810430"," I can open up a ratio spread That way if we blast up to 5000 and q1 I'll get paid"
"18810430","18816670"," at least something on my bearishness Right, let's say we just start running right now into february"
"18816670","18817370"," 14th."
"18817390","18818810"," We don't even pull back just gone, right?"
"18820990","18825290"," Uh, uh, racial bear ratio spread would pay off the trade I might not make a bunch. "
"18825490","18830830"," They were like five percent of the trade if i'm wrong in my bearishness Right, what's the other"
"18830830","18831250"," thing i can do?"
"18832010","18841710"," Uh, i'm trying to open at the close today Uh put spread that's for five at 500 And, uh, 490"
"18842290","18851230"," 500 490 put spread for may 17 Pays like 60 70 percent If we start racing to the downside, i'll"
"18851230","18858450"," close it and get more aggressive with puts It feels great having that hedge on if we go up because"
"18858450","18870630"," I can trade it up with confidence Um, so that's where i'm at right now I was tesla doing I"
"18870630","18878250"," I am not in a put spread right now n-o-t good question I am trying to put a"
"18878250","18881350"," put spread on Uh, I have it set up here in the background."

"19250180","19251580"," I'm going to get a prince either way."
"19251860","19260920"," I have a very high probability of being paid on this trade And I don't care about market direction"
"19260920","19267080"," as much as some trades do do I This trade you don't care if we go up to 500 if"
"19267080","19271940"," you know it's come back down in the correction later on anyways Now if we were if we aggressively"

"20473070","20482550"," is right here Okay, uh, so we're actually right here So i'm expecting a roll down For the beginning"
"20482550","20488830"," of february and then i'm expecting a big Been larger move up into the middle of february and i'm"
"20488830","20497650"," looking for a constructive, um correction into middle of march So just for me what I am doing now"
"20497650","20507810"," that there is a difference here Um And what to expect this week out of ndx So,"
"20508190","20518050"," um ndx seasonality Is looking more Neutral and um instead of more down it's looking"
"20518050","20518830"," like this, right?"
"20519190","20526750"," This is actually today's move saying yesterday's move is right here Okay Uh, but ndx not so much"
"20526750","20532850"," right just sideways a little bit of down and then boom So i'm going to expect this for next week"
"20532850","20539910"," or this week coming up i'm going to expect my expectation here Doesn't mean we trade there it can"
"20539910","20549870"," be wrong But my expectation personally my expectation Is at the close of business today"
"20550550","20557950"," And we come into next week You're going to be waiting for inflows for the month of february in my"
"20557950","20565590"," view We're going to grind down into the right And we're likely going to see a lot of pain or"
"20565590","20569910"," we'll see big nice squeezes We'll see individual tickers squeeze and trade higher."
"20570310","20577530"," We'll see some blast down We'll likely see a little bit less action in the indexes that are that"
"20577530","20579270"," hold Does that make sense?"
"20579850","20586150"," So you might see like spy squeeze up before close then come back down Uh during the next bit next"
"20586150","20589810"," day next session Do you understand where i'm coming from here?"
"20589890","20596410"," So like trade it sideways let uh er's begin and start You might have a great update you might have"
"20596410","20602570"," a great down day great update great down day Then we get out and into the end of the month"
"20603370","20611890"," And we're going to get the big tech earnings And we're going to in my view Trade the the indexes"
"20611890","20617850"," are going to move to the upside So from my close here today wherever we close here today my"
"20617850","20625410"," bearishness Is not maybe your bearishness my bearishness is more consultative and not um"
"20625410","20632230"," distribution not corrective Uh, so i'm just going to take it in the money Uh put spread let me show"
"20632230","20642830"," you another thing here So the other idea here is this Let's"
"20642830","20648670"," say i'm wrong in this put spread right Uh here we'll just put it on spx let's say i'm wrong"
"20649430","20659390"," captain was wrong Right captain was wrong We're not doing any of this we're just"

"20671090","20677900"," gets paid right there It makes sense i don't even need this i just need this right here the big"
"20677900","20682360"," rollback down here I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to roll back down even in this"
"20682360","20689780"," scenario Heading into middle of winter so for me Um in the closed today i'm going to get a put"
"20689780","20698170"," spread i'm going to look to uh get capture uh print on it Uh i'm going to try to get"
