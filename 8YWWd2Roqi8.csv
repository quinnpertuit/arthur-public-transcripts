"54660","55380"," Morning, Jafar."
"56100","57200"," Not a suit, good morning."
"58260","59160"," Make a good morning. "
"59940","60780"," And just these wee truss."
"61540","62400"," Belgian, Nick."

"66200","66860"," Morning, X."
"68720","69580"," Morning, Captain, Ron."
"69840","70240"," Your wife's boyfriend."
"70760","71740"," There's some working early this morning. "
"72280","73680"," Hell, yeah, I went to sleep last night."
"73940","74380"," Morning, Gil."
"75040","75340"," Hi, Gil. "
"75520","76900"," Morning, I don't know if you're interested in replacing anything."
"77240","79020"," It should be a material teal wind to either die."
"79620","84700"," I ended up skiing Saturday, Sunday, worn out, slept all my long last night, woke up early. "
"85400","85880"," Good morning, Lucy."
"86020","86660"," Good morning, leaky face."
"88480","89680"," It was so good, you guys. "
"89880","90540"," That was a jag."
"90640","91780"," I didn't say you were a jag-ass."
"92660","92700"," I didn't say you're a jag-ass. "
"92700","94100"," I didn't say you're a jag-ass."
"94100","94640"," I didn't say you're a"
"94640","109000"," jag "
"109000","109000","-ass."
"109000","110240"," Tyler, GP, Mark. "
"110600","111060"," How's everybody doing?"
"112140","113340"," They're always doing well today."
"114920","119600"," PSCO, partner, supply partner, list, software, aging, integration, solution, single, Sierra,"
"119880","120260"," Charlie, Oscar."
"121740","122380"," All right. "
"122660","123480"," Yeah, we're getting everybody in here."
"125560","126340"," Hell, yeah."
"126920","126920"," Tesla. "
"128080","130460"," That's going to piss off, Winky today, saying Tesla."
"132300","135860"," I haven't read that story yet about good morning, Gil, Harbor."
"136370","137440"," I haven't read that story yet. "
"137560","139920"," It's more than that Tesla's been shipping cars without parts."
"141020","141760"," I don't see."
"142140","142660"," Good to see you. "
"144400","145240"," Good morning, everybody."
"145580","147460"," All right, we're going to go to the live stream here."
"148760","149660"," We're going to switch over. "
"149720","150360"," Good morning, James."
"150580","151100"," Good morning, Joe."
"151300","151660"," Yeah. "
"151720","155900"," John Deere, DE-Quine, majority of the leadership in Cressel Electric, Delta Echo."
"156900","159600"," All right, so we see that we see if I can have good morning chance soon."
"159600","162580"," The completion of the transaction announcement in December. "
"163200","165180"," I think, Tyler, let me see if I can turn this down."
"165780","168840"," We're going to get some before we start listening to my partner here."
"169560","170800"," Good morning, Sparky. "
"171000","171620"," Good morning, bulls."
"173000","177360"," Good morning, Vegas, Dylan, Detroit EV, Juice, good morning."
"178240","179020"," Everybody's doing well. "
"179340","180700"," Okay, we'll be quick this morning, okay?"
"181200","182300"," We're going to get a half an hour until we open."
"182940","183380"," Good morning, HP."
"183720","186720"," Hope everybody's had a great night where we got some sleep. "
"187480","189620"," Hope nobody bought that dip into the overnight."
"191720","192860"," Because it did an apron."
"193640","194920"," We got some thing of her in this morning. "
"196720","200180"," You know, I figured it would sell off, actually, in the overnight, and that is really what we, the"
"200180","203420"," conversation is this morning is we did not sell off overnight."
"203960","208500"," Last night was a prime opportunity to sell the market."
"209240","210320"," It's a perfect setup. "
"210460","213120"," We've done this many times in the past low liquidity environment."
"213120","214100"," You can swoop right in."
"214300","215100"," You don't need any news. "
"215140","216700"," You just sell this market straight down."
"217240","221860"," And there's still a chance of that this morning that we could sell the market down off the bell or"
"221860","223140"," at least to a support level."
"223420","226680"," Now, I haven't read the Spark yet this morning. "
"227640","233340"," I started reading the first paragraph of it, but it's interesting because it sets up to the same"
"233340","237460"," levels that I posted this morning on Twitter, like 4 a.m. or something like that."
"237540","239060"," It's the same same shit, nothing different."
"239660","242800"," But it's important because today they didn't do it. "
"242840","245820"," They didn't do it last night in the overnight, right?"
"246560","250600"," And so the bears have something that they need to do this morning."
"250620","253740"," They need to commit this morning at the cash open and sell this market down."
"254000","259899"," If they can't commit to it and get to certain levels, right, there's a fair chance as we head"
"259899","265720"," towards February 18th and as these puts start to lose their value that we're going to spring up and"
"265720","266220"," trade higher. "
"266940","269540"," Now, I don't think that we trade higher to all-time highs."
"269780","272700"," My viewpoint is still ultimately bearish right now."
"273080","276300"," If not somewhat neutral to bearish on the market. "
"277320","281240"," If we trade it over 4,600, sure, we can take a bullish stance and trade up to all-time"
"281240","281480"," highs."
"281940","285980"," I don't see the reasons why would we get that they hadn't shown themselves yet as well, would trade"
"285980","286640"," up to all-time highs."
"287240","292000"," But this still fits the narrative of, let's say we trade up to 456 or 460, we reject and then"
"292000","295600"," we trade back down and revisit those lower lows, right?"
"295720","298200"," Those four twenties, four thirties, stuff like that. "
"298320","301100"," We hammer out a second bottom in the market."
"301520","304120"," So just be aware of that as we head into the nine o'clock hour."
"304500","309680"," Yesterday I talked to you guys, we're going to briefly go through the economic calendar, right?"
"309840","310620"," It's kind of boring today. "
"311600","313000"," Today is Tuesday, the eighth."
"313720","315700"," We've got the small business index that already came out."
"315760","318520"," We've got trade deficit, real household debt, not much news today. "
"319160","322920"," We've got Michelle Bowman and Loretta Master tomorrow."
"323420","325200"," I think one's kind of bearish in one."
"325400","330520"," I think Loretta Master is neutral and then Bowman might be slightly more bearish. "
"330640","332900"," And of course we've got whatever he wants to know, right?"
"333160","334020"," CPIs on Thursday."
"335580","338440"," We're anticipating that those are going to be bad, some bad numbers."
"338760","341380"," That's good in a way that we already know they're going to be some bad numbers. "
"341720","349040"," We all know that this market heading into inflation numbers on Thursday."
"349720","354440"," So that is one positive for the bulls, because even if they're going to sell this market off, they"
"354440","355660"," might they might pump it up, right?"
"355780","357580"," They do this just like they're doing a PTON right now, right?"
"357700","359980"," They pump it up and they drop the market later on."
"360640","365640"," So keep that in mind as we head down or head through Tuesday and Wednesday here into Thursday on"
"365640","366560"," Cat Captain's Alpha. "
"367340","368940"," I posted a by the dip type situation."
"369740","371420"," So we're going to look at the spot gamma report."
"372200","373660"," I promise that we would do that together. "
"374540","375420"," So this is for today."
"376120","380520"," If any of you guys remember is the spot gamma."
"381620","382680"," I appreciate it. "
"382880","383960"," There's a link down the description."
"384340","386080"," I'm not associated with them in any way, shape or form."
"386780","388200"," We'll talk about that later to it. "
"388320","389980"," We'll tell it that kind of stuff later on."
"390300","392920"," But I'm not associated or affiliated in any shape way or format."
"392920","394940"," I'm not paid by spot gamma in any way, shape or form. "
"395540","399480"," And if you want, if you don't even want to get this stuff, most of us here either have it"
"399480","402020"," or we discuss it at nauseam, you don't have to pay for this."
"402240","403940"," I use this every single day."
"404700","409720"," And most of the traders in here have some concept of what's going on with spot gamma's positioning"
"409720","411720"," day in and day out. "
"412080","412980"," So for this morning, right?"
"413120","414460"," It says futures are narrow overnight lows."
"414960","416060"," You guys read the stuff right now."
"416060","416620"," I think that you can. "
"417120","418680"," I'm going to see if you guys can see this, okay?"
"419260","420280"," So this is their daily note."
"420280","423000"," They write this every single morning and in the am and in the pm."
"423780","426480"," Futures are narrow in a lows of 4470 after quiet overnight session. "
"427220","430480"," Kim index registers at .7, which implies high volatility for today."
"430740","439220"," Resistance is at 45 hundred and then 4530 to the downside received support at 4458, 4445, 4400."
"439580","444400"," The chart that I posted to you this morning at four a.m. has the same numbers within a tick"
"444400","444720"," or two. "
"445300","448560"," While this drift lower does indicate we're in a regime of more negative gamma, we think that it"
"448560","450140"," will take some time right over here."
"450900","457100"," It will take some force to push markets away from 45, 450 on spy, 4,500 as shown below."
"457660","461920"," There's a lot of both call and put gamma tide to that 4,500 strike. "
"462800","463820"," That's a key point, right?"
"463960","465780"," Well, drift lowered lower, right?"
"465980","468160"," Does indicate that we are in a regime with more negative again."
"468280","472280"," We think that it will take some force to push market away from 4,500, right?"
"472420","474620"," That there's a pin almost at 4,500."
"475060","480060"," So even if we trade down below, we should try to trade higher into that 4,500. "
"480400","482900"," Now, without even reading any further on, right?"
"482900","486820"," That's the key to this is that you are going to be looking for, like we've been talking about,"
"486920","486980"," right?"
"487080","487620"," All week long, right?"
"487960","489040"," The bulls have to step up."
"489220","493600"," They have to start trade, have to start making bets that are higher, but we're not even 4,600."
"493920","497400"," They need to make bets like 4,700 for us to get to 4,600. "
"497700","502060"," They need to be placing bets that are further down the road, like one month, three months, five"
"502060","507160"," months down the road with big money trying to expand the market, right?"
"507340","508380"," Trying to expand where we trade."
"509600","513620"," Now, while this drift, this drift lower does indicate we're in a regime of boring negative gamma."
"513960","516440"," I think it'll take some force to push the markets away from 4,500. "
"516780","520840"," As shown below, there's a lot of there's a lot of both call input gamma tied to this 4,500"
"520840","521240"," strike."
"521760","525400"," Calls positive gamma are predominantly above and puts a volatility inducing negative gamma"
"525400","526780"," predominantly below, right?"
"527300","528860"," So that's another tell."
"529100","534640"," It's telling you that bulls aren't buying shit that's outside of outside of inside the money. "
"534740","541220"," It means that bulls are buying like calls on the spy that are right at the money for today or"
"541220","542500"," tomorrow expire, right?"
"542600","544520"," bulls aren't saying, yeah, you know what, I'm going to buy some weeklies."
"545020","545980"," I'm going to buy some monthlies."
"546420","549960"," We know that the VIX is high, so you can't really swing this stuff, right?"
"550280","553060"," So everybody's like trading, day trading, day trading, day trading. "
"553380","554820"," It's all that's going on in this market."
"555120","559320"," And so it's all it's good for this markets only good for us entering in the morning and getting out"
"559320","559820"," at night time."
"560960","565100"," Health strikes above remain fairly small in size for both the SPX and spy. "
"565360","567660"," I'll put some spikes for main significant, right?"
"567780","569420"," This is all the hedging that's inside the market."
"569860","572700"," This is where people are telling you that that market isn't being hedged."
"572700","577280"," It is fully hedged into 18th of February, fully hedged into 18th of March. "
"577820","584340"," Bears need to to almost waterfall and cascade more puts to get those puts to print, okay?"
"584500","585560"," And they're not doing that."
"585840","587480"," And if they're not going to do that, right?"
"587620","589140"," We're not going to trade down there either."
"589960","594340"," Well, this data shown below only goes back or less or equal to them. "
"594340","599860"," One year, this chart implies we're still a ways from large call strikes, blue dots building, which"
"599860","601520"," brings positive gamma and low volatility regimes."
"601620","602420"," We already discussed that."
"603140","607900"," On this point, we know that the brief, put strike in QTQs is also predominant, right?"
"608820","611620"," And we'll watch as a key downside level in the Qs. "
"611820","615780"," Now, the key about this point right here, right, is as we're trying to trade the spy or you're"
"615780","617500"," trying to trade your favorite ticker."
"617900","620160"," Remember yesterday, we were looking at Tesla, right?"
"621320","622460"," Tesla 50, right off the belt."
"622680","624460"," And you know that it ain't going higher than 950. "
"624460","625460"," I'm going to tell you right now, eight."
"626000","629000"," So it needed to trade up slowly over the course of the day."
"629040","629440"," And it didn't. "
"629520","631420"," It just went up and took money and ran."
"631560","632520"," And then we started trading down."
"632820","636200"," But this morning's set up for the Qs is better than yesterday. "
"636780","640560"," A lot of the Qs this morning, I'm looking at them before we open here, and they're looking better"
"640560","642840"," this morning than they were right up the gate."
"643000","647940"," So we'll see if we'll see if the bulls just come out, slam it up high, take their money and"
"647940","649320"," run before in the first half an hour."
"649720","654360"," Or if the Qs trade down, if the Qs trade down right off the belt, there's a there's a fair"
"654360","654680"," point. "
"655000","659360"," It's like, I think Tesla was at like 905 earlier, if it trades on like 880, that's going to trigger"
"659360","660460"," day traders to step in."
"660560","666740"," It's going to give the room that's needed for Tesla to trade up, let's say from 880 to 950, 935,"
"666920","670980"," 950 that put an extra 80 200 points on the board, the day Tesla."
"672440","676500"," So our point here is that even while markets were somewhat quiet yesterday, the volatility"
"676500","678920"," potential remains are mainly due to large positions. "
"679400","681820"," As an old yesterday view, Python volatility is very valued."
"682180","687320"," And so we'll take real buying calls or stocks to put markets up out of this negative gamma"
"687320","687960"," position, right?"
"688080","688800"," We already discussed this."
"689100","691800"," We're not sure of an imminent catalyst to initiate risk on. "
"692260","694640"," And this is a key point right here this morning, right?"
"695320","700120"," Is that what I'm highlighting right here is that there has to be some news in the market that we"
"700120","701260"," don't know about this morning."
"701580","707420"," It has to be something that's positive in an outlook perspective not the guard."
"707780","708760"," There's nobody out there, right?"
"708840","709860"," The guard's not going to change this. "
"710280","713900"," European markets closing in the afternoon is not going to change this."
"713980","718500"," You need something in the market that's going to give bulls this feeling that we're going higher."
"718720","720620"," Now, that doesn't mean we go to 47480. "
"720940","723220"," We just need them to make those bets that we're going that high."
"723700","730460"," And barring that exogenous or genus trigger positive fed headlines, key points, right?"
"730460","736180"," Markets remain vulnerable to a shift higher in IV, which pushes into negative gamma-dealer"
"736180","736380"," position."
"737160","742000"," In that scenario, IV or high shift in IV or a VIX greater than 25, we see the S&P"
"742000","746980"," positioned for a quick move down into 425 and cues into 340. "
"747340","750520"," This is a key thing to be looking at, okay?"
"751280","752920"," Key thing to be looking at."
"753360","756380"," So if the IV gets greater than 25, we talk about 23 number."
"757700","761280"," If we're going to sell this market, so it is key for you if you're going to be day trading. "
"761520","767200"," Don't think that just because we're day trading another market, right, with zero dates that we"
"767200","769860"," impact the market, we don't, okay?"
"770200","770700"," We don't."
"770960","773760"," So even though we're trading that, right?"
"773940","777720"," It doesn't mean that the VIX can't go up, right?"
"777800","781240"," So if we see the VIX go up today above 23 seats to go to 25, we're going to see"
"781240","782380"," the markets start to sell down."
"783120","785460"," 425 is on the table, at least, okay?"
"786340","787760"," Then 340 on the cues. "
"788280","790920"," So don't be out there being like, oh, you know, we'll create the news ourselves."
"791120","793560"," We're going to buy ourselves a month out, three month out, 480 calls."
"793860","795140"," Don't do any of that crazy shit. "
"795540","800920"," We need to follow what the market is doing, and right now the market is deeply hedged, and any bad"
"800920","805680"," news that comes out can drive that VIX up and start to sell down this market."
"805880","806900"," So be conscious of that."
"807100","811340"," That's why we're day trading this market right now just because of this specific stuff right here. "
"811560","814800"," And we're going to pay attention to any positive news that comes into the market."
"814800","815880"," That's market moving."
"816120","820820"," It'd probably be something, if there is some news, it'd probably be some kind of a de-escalation"
"820820","824560"," with Russia, possibly, something that we don't know about in the market. "
"824560","829740"," I don't know what that news is outside of whatever that hot topic is right now being, I think"
"829740","831940"," Russia is the only thing that I can think about."
"832260","839200"," Maybe it is CPI on Thursday, but you know, the jobs that came out on Friday of last week, they"
"839200","840180"," still sold the market down."
"841020","841900"," So maybe it's that. "
"842240","843920"," Maybe it's on Thursday, we actually go up."
"844060","844800"," I'm not sure on that."
"846160","848800"," Other than that, it gives you some levels, some volatility triggers. "
"849300","851860"," There's a whole bunch of stuff that they'd give you further on down below."
"852520","857340"," They show you where all the vol and gamma levels are, and they typically will..."
"857340","862500"," I have a script for trading view that I can upload their levels out every day."
"863120","867820"," I used to do that every single day, and now I just read the numbers here, and then I compare"
"867820","870380"," it to what I have done on my own. "
"870920","872120"," So we're gonna get rid of the spot camera report."
"872260","877120"," At this point, you can pause this, go back to it if you want, and that pretty much coincides with"
"877120","878480"," these levels down here, right?"
"879260","887740"," We've got this support level here that is at 44.67. I think they had it at 44.50. So"
"887740","892100"," somewhere down in here, if we slip down below right here, this is that 4,500 mark."
"892300","893420"," You've also got the 44. "
"893700","896480"," I think it's 4400 to drop that down there."
"896940","900700"," I've got this other level down below here, and we'll show you the rest here."
"901440","903500"," And it all matches up to my own charting, right?"
"903640","907500"," So if I see stuff matching up to my own charting, if I see the spot camera's matching up to"
"907500","913380"," this, if I see that the icebergs on market profile, volume profile, or match up to this stuff, I'm"
"913380","916380"," checking for known economic news that's coming out for today, right?"
"916500","918000"," It starts to look like what they're saying. "
"918420","919160"," It's almost the same shit."
"919240","920720"," Am I making any mistakes in my charting?"
"920960","922380"," And I'm not right, 4400."
"922740","926980"," And then the last solid dip kind of a thing is down here at 4400, right?"
"927420","930520"," This is actual bottom down here, supposedly, that they claim. "
"930720","932680"," Sometimes when we sell the mark, we get lower than this."
"933280","935260"," Now we can make this a little bit bigger here, right?"
"935780","938080"," Take a look and see what that's all about, right?"
"938560","940020"," That's their little red line down here."
"940440","945280"," And you can see that would be if we were to slip down into this level right here, right?"
"945400","947420"," That would be a nice little slip down of 4400. "
"947420","950200"," To be honest, we can really go even lower, right?"
"950580","953100"," We've got one touch here, another touch here, another touch."
"953340","956760"," We kind of miss this touch here, but we actually can go much lower."
"956920","960040"," This is 430 over the course of days into Thursday. "
"960540","962600"," This is what the bears want is way down here."
"962700","969040"," They want to see us move all the way down here heading into this to be the 10th, right?"
"969600","971400"," And two and two more days shocker."
"971560","977940"," It matches up perfectly to to CPI data, right?"
"978120","979320"," We have some ugly CPI news. "
"980140","982080"," We'll put this one out here too."
"982880","985540"," We can see where this megaphone pattern is."
"986140","990780"," This is kind of where this is kind of where the bears are hoping we can sell this down and"
"990780","995920"," keep selling down into CPI. "
"995920","996560"," We'll end here."
"997280","1000120"," Possibly even go lower into, let's say we have a bad CPI."
"1000120","1000980"," We trade down here. "
"1001400","1004880"," And then we are looking at OPEC, so we continue to trade down to that 420 level."
"1005300","1006560"," Don't forget these two touches here."
"1006620","1010200"," One, two, and we get this third touch down here and then rip higher. "
"1010540","1014840"," So we need a failure here for the bears to get what they want to get trading down lower."
"1015480","1015840"," Okay."
"1016160","1019440"," And then the last point would be, yeah, I was going to look at the, I was going to look"
"1019440","1023800"," at the charts for ES, but I think this is all you need for today. "
"1024599","1033359"," If you want to, I think I posted what I was looking at on for today on Twitter this morning,"
"1033359","1039119"," but if you guys want me to post another chart that's updated, I can for the open today."
"1039440","1041160"," So this is my game plan for today, okay?"
"1041740","1045319"," So my game plan for today is, I'm hoping that we don't do a green bar straight up."
"1045640","1047740"," We could just a few scenarios, right?"
"1047880","1048840"," We green borrowed off the open. "
"1049100","1050720"," We've got what, 15 minutes left."
"1051220","1054980"," If we green borrowed up off the open, there's two scenarios here, okay?"
"1055400","1060840"," The first scenario would be that we, let's see if I can, you know what I'll do?"
"1061560","1063180"," I'm going to cut and paste this."
"1063740","1069360"," I'm going to show you guys a big cut and paste this real quick. "
"1070560","1073000"," And I'll do some chicken scratches here for you."
"1075140","1077120"," What are some scenarios for today?"
"1077540","1081180"," Okay, so some scenarios say, right, would be we green borrowed straight up, right?"
"1081580","1082120"," We reject."
"1082720","1083980"," Okay, we start trading down. "
"1084740","1086840"," That's a very common one, right?"
"1088680","1089460"," Pull on here."
"1091380","1096040"," customize this, make it yellow, okay?"
"1097060","1098900"," We're going to do this thing with W right here."
"1101620","1103880"," So your first chance right here is that we trade up here. "
"1104120","1104820"," It's automatic rejection."
"1105240","1107780"," Even if it's just a little bit, we come up green bar, start rejecting."
"1109280","1110000"," That's first thing. "
"1110080","1110980"," I don't like seeing those, right?"
"1111760","1113600"," Now there's, you'll look at it."
"1113700","1117960"," It'll green bar for like five minutes, let's say at max, five minutes straight green bar down."
"1118820","1119960"," That's, that's bearish, right?"
"1120620","1124380"," The next thing would be that we're looking for is that we just start melting up today, right?"
"1124520","1125500"," We just start doing like this. "
"1126120","1131160"," Okay, if you start seeing this, it'll take like, you'll know within 15 minutes to half an hour that"
"1131160","1132540"," it's not this green bar and then rejection."
"1133060","1136900"," That would be a melt up shorts covering and we're heading north here, okay?"
"1137380","1138740"," I don't think that's happening either."
"1139000","1143280"," What I think is going to happen is that we might green bar it up briefly, but then we're going"
"1143280","1145300"," to trade down to one of these levels and then take it higher. "
"1145600","1147400"," It could be here, it could be down here."
"1148120","1152260"," If we start to break below this channel right here, right?"
"1152560","1159060"," This is at 4,400, and I would also look at 4,399, I believe, just below here."
"1159460","1163160"," We start to break below these levels, that's where you're going to get bearish. "
"1163280","1166100"," If you're a bear right off the bell, you could probably try to grab something."
"1166380","1171200"," My expectation is that we either green bar it up and start trade down to find some support, some"
"1171200","1173100"," buyers take this higher today, okay?"
"1173460","1176040"," That's my, that's my thought process for taste."
"1176180","1180560"," I'm going to let us open this morning right off the bell and see if we can catch some support"
"1180560","1183480"," down below and stay inside of this channel here today. "
"1183980","1189820"," Stay at this support down below here, one, two, and maybe three right here or down here at this"
"1189820","1197240"," major support at 4,400 and trade this up to at least 4,500 and pay attention, pay attention to"
"1197240","1202580"," see if if we have new call flow coming in that can send us higher to break through this resistance,"
"1202580","1202940"," right?"
"1203440","1207380"," We know about this resistance here, we know about it here, we know about it here."
"1207980","1212020"," So if the bulls don't step it up right here and the bears don't pile back in, we're going to"
"1212020","1218480"," try to trade this up into 4,560 at minimum, not this 4,500, 39, we're going to try to"
"1218480","1224160"," get through all this volatility, try to trade this up into 4,560, if not 4,600 at some point"
"1224160","1225540"," tomorrow, okay?"
"1225700","1231040"," So that's the key for today is where are the key pivots, hold on a second here, key for today"
"1231040","1233040"," is where are all the key pivot points, right?"
"1233460","1238080"," We want to be looking to see if we have bullish or bearish context and what we do off the"
"1238080","1239640"," bell this morning, okay?"
"1239700","1243480"," So we want to see what this reaction is of the bell, do we straight green bar it down?"
"1243660","1248360"," Let's say we start trading down right away, if we start to find like we start to see like one,"
"1248860","1253840"," start to see some shit like this, break through here, break through here and that's like one, two,"
"1254820","1255100"," three, right?"
"1255300","1259900"," We got a nice big rejections here, we'll take this north, okay?"
"1259980","1264220"," If it starts to dribble down in here, we're going to look to then get bearish and pick up some"
"1264220","1266580"," puts and start taking this train lower today."
"1267060","1269280"," You guys get me to this morning, you guys understand?"
"1274740","1278780"," Maybe country right here with the market doesn't have to do anything, get over trade your account. "
"1279060","1282180"," Do you guys understand all this this morning?"
"1285350","1288930"," I'm off at the third at the third digit, 44, 45, 44."
"1290290","1293870"," All right, so what I'll do is I'm going to post to you guys, I'm going to post you guys"
"1293870","1295830"," on Twitter levels for you this morning, okay?"
"1297590","1302970"," There we go, right off the bell, we're going to see what the initial reaction off the market is."
"1303230","1308110"," We know we've got two days until, just heads up to you guys, we only have two days until CPI,"
"1308530","1309290"," we've got Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"1310110","1314590"," Okay, we're going to see if we trade this trade Tuesday down here, look for a dip to buy to"
"1314590","1319510"," take this north or to get super, uber, duper bearish and start driving this down lower this"
"1319510","1319750"," morning."
"1320130","1325450"," If you were a bear and you want to take this down for the initial up market open, we'll look"
"1325450","1327330"," to see this green bar fake out."
"1327610","1329930"," If we see the red bar fake out, we'll start taking this north. "
"1338170","1339110"," What's going on this morning?"
"1339170","1339930"," How are you guys doing out there?"
"1344440","1345160"," Good morning."
"1345340","1348620"," I don't know, I missed a bunch of what you guys are saying up here, trying to scroll through."
"1348880","1351840"," Let me turn on the equity markets, the global equity news as we open the market. "
"1351840","1354000"," You're listening to trade the new."
"1354020","1355020"," We've got nine more minutes left."
"1358330","1361810"," All right, let me scroll through these news, news pieces and see if there's anything worth"
"1361810","1362710"," listening to here. "
"1371530","1373430"," Amazon expand healthcare offerings."
"1373510","1374950"," Amazon came up with some wacky stuff yesterday."
"1374950","1381910"," Did you guys see, did you guys see them saying they're going to pay their employees more because"
"1381910","1383750"," their stock was down?"
"1384970","1386710"," They're giving options to people. "
"1387050","1387950"," Food hog did well."
"1388370","1388890"," I like hog."
"1389430","1390590"," I thought hog would do well today. "
"1391350","1392270"," Sorry, Davidson, it did well."
"1398840","1403640"," Yeah, I think today is a key to be watching the VIX and then Paul is making a good point."
"1403640","1408180"," Bonds be watching yields today without a doubt. "
"1408400","1409440"," Yields is another one."
"1409740","1410440"," Make sure to keep."
"1410620","1414220"," Matter of fact, I should put a HyG up on my charts today. "
"1423200","1426280"," I've got a who else I have got XLU in my charts as well."
"1426300","1428860"," I want to see if that's any kind of a leading indicator."
"1430160","1430560"," HyG. "
"1432280","1437400"," I want to be watching HyG this morning."
"1437700","1439600"," Okay, so I'm going to turn this off here."
"1439660","1447580"," I'm going to get you guys rolling with a book map this morning and good morning, everybody. "
"1450570","1452430"," Yeah, oil yields are make a break."
"1452470","1452910"," It was awesome."
"1453070","1454790"," It was weird to see energy just keep ripping. "
"1455450","1458450"," I know the energy stocks don't always follow oil."
"1465240","1466320"," Enron Chairman's hilarious."
"1469000","1472220"," Is Enron Chairman, is that, that's the Twitter handle, right?"
"1472220","1473940"," He's cool as fuck, I think. "
"1476220","1477160"," Good morning, Joe."
"1481100","1482860"," I'm missing half what you guys are saying out there."
"1483120","1483700"," I'm out of the loop. "
"1486040","1486840"," Good morning, Steve."
"1487080","1487480"," Good morning, Jess."
"1487820","1488400"," How's everybody doing?"
"1489320","1491740"," Jess, can you be looking by that dip this morning on Tesla, brother?"
"1491940","1495800"," If we can get Tesla down like 880, brother, if we don't sell this market this morning, there might"
"1495800","1497700"," be some some money in Tesla today, bro. "
"1500560","1501460"," There's a chance of it."
"1502200","1503740"," Let's keep an eye on Tesla this morning."
"1504400","1505320"," Good morning, Benny Mac. "
"1505460","1505720"," How are you?"
"1506180","1507020"," Everybody's doing well."
"1507520","1508740"," 30, 180 of you here?"
"1509440","1510280"," Yeah, you're a rumor."
"1510680","1511300"," TLT calls. "
"1511880","1514340"," I want to keep an eye on TLT as well."
"1514880","1518600"," There was some TLT news yesterday as well from Europe, right?"
"1519640","1520740"," Good morning, Mary."
"1521660","1524120"," On the guard, but I don't know if it was the guard. "
"1524260","1526320"," I forget who that news came in from yesterday."
"1528840","1530040"," Check the settings here."
"1531620","1532420"," All right, all right. "
"1532500","1532700"," Hold on."
"1532880","1533360"," That's not available."
"1534500","1536080"," We're looking for DX feed. "
"1537400","1538040"," Good morning."
"1538280","1539720"," Morning BTCCK."
"1540120","1541080"," Good morning, Sam. "
"1541560","1542220"," Sam, how are you?"
"1543380","1544620"," Connections are reconnected."
"1545640","1546760"," Let's buy this morning."
"1548760","1550320"," I think there's some money to be made today. "
"1551080","1553420"," I think that there's some money on the up or downside."
"1553740","1556680"," We're going to make a move for the next two days, I think, into CPI."
"1558580","1561080"," I don't know, you know, it's of all the big caps. "
"1561660","1563340"," It's the only one that I'm unsure of right now."
"1567120","1567860"," It's coming in."
"1567960","1568860"," It's coming to the open right now. "
"1568860","1573140"," We get six minutes left, and Facebook's finding a bid off the open so far."
"1578320","1579660"," Configuration add-ons."
"1579780","1580340"," We're going to put on. "
"1582420","1584000"," If you're a bear out there, too, right?"
"1584560","1587620"," If we trade up, I wouldn't be going on here."
"1589160","1590220"," Why is my jar file?"
"1590920","1591900"," I want my jar file."
"1597140","1602640"," Don't be too concerned, because if we do trade higher, or if we don't trade down the levels that"
"1602640","1608900"," you're looking for right now, we need more information on the market to find out what's going to"
"1608900","1609180"," happen. "
"1613950","1619670"," If the seller is still above here, right before the bell, 4470, we're in conscience of this before"
"1619670","1620510"," the opening this morning."
"1621350","1624610"," I still have that steady stream of sellers above."
"1625030","1626330"," We didn't wear out the sellers. "
"1626730","1627530"," We know they're there."
"1632910","1637130"," Less than five minutes left, four minutes, 30 seconds left to open this morning."
"1637210","1639430"," Let's see how far what the delay is. "
"1639510","1641270"," The lag is on the stream this morning."
"1648970","1649770"," Maybe a second here."
"1649810","1650970"," I'm trying to set my own stuff up here. "
"1661750","1665930"," I'll give you guys a bigger screener on Twitter right now as well, so you can see this in a"
"1665930","1666910"," bigger time frame."
"1670750","1679490"," Give you a smaller day trading chart, and I'll give you a close the larger time frame."
"1685310","1689270"," Smaller time frame on just a five day chart, maybe. "
"1703780","1712220"," Some comments from the UK's department of the DMO's chief steam in saying that the backdrop for"
"1712220","1715460"," bond market conditions remains volatile."
"1716200","1721610"," That's not good news, not good news."
"1722930","1725900"," One day chart. "

"2670800","2677900"," They should be like the 450 C's or $1.39. They should be like 60, 70 cents somewhere in there. "
"2678460","2680140"," They're now down at all 40."

"3024940","3029420"," Didn't matter if we were going up or if we were going down, it doesn't matter, right?"
"3029920","3034020"," But on the uptrend, you could buy here, let's say, right?"
"3034660","3035920"," And you would follow this trend. "
"3038480","3038920"," Right."
"3039000","3043140"," Over the course of a month, you could buy some calls here and they would print after a month like"
"3043140","3043400"," here."
"3044240","3046980"," Same thing on the downward side, something like that, right?"
"3047120","3047520"," Nice and gentle. "
"3048940","3052980"," Well, now what you end up having is you have the same slope, let's say."
"3052980","3056700"," On the minute now, to the expected polish and the center bank rate decision, it's like to raise by"
"3056700","3061560"," 50 basis points to 2.75%. Now we're doing this right here."
"3064240","3072040"," And what you're doing is you've got high frequency trading firms that computers and robots that are"
"3072040","3075440"," eating all the intrinsic value are these options as we head up. "
"3076300","3082420"," So due to that, you're not able to trade over a length of time, like one to three months out,"
"3082420","3086460"," let's say, same things going for on the downward side."
"3087120","3089540"," And that has to all has to do with computers."
"3090500","3091200"," Don't be blaming. "
"3091600","3093040"," Don't be blaming day traders for this."
"3093040","3094900"," Don't be blaming retail traders for this."
"3095240","3102640"," All that shit that's being talked about is because of high-frequency trading for firms, basically"
"3102640","3103580"," robots and computers. "
"3105020","3109680"," I hear that argument out there that it's day traders, retail traders that are doing this, but the"
"3109680","3118820"," reality is 50 basis points as expected to 2.75%. Oh shit, that's that is mixed."
"3119820","3121380"," Okay, you guys need to know this."
"3122080","3127740"," So Poland Central Bank raised their base rate by 50 BTS. "
"3127740","3130120"," The other rates also going up 50 basis points."
"3131280","3132060"," Who else is?"
"3135990","3137290"," That's actually pretty big news."
"3140000","3140900"," Warning out there. "
"3141760","3149640"," So if Europe is raising their rates by 50 BPS, the idea would be that it's happening there."
"3149740","3150880"," It's going to happen here as well."
"3151540","3158600"," There are some spy puts at this point, February 9th, 446 P, 467,000 dollars. "
"3163440","3164520"," Yeah, you could buy any dip."
"3166700","3167740"," I'll go into that more."
"3167980","3169700"," I'll go into that whole concept. "
"3170460","3176520"," Another time I've talked about it before on Twitter, but not as in depth as I should."
"3178080","3180160"," About why we can't do certain things."
"3180360","3181400"," This was pre 2020. "
"3181740","3188740"," It's like pre 2020 is whether by you could find out a direction of a spy for like one month"
"3188740","3191520"," and be like, I know we're going down for a month on the spy."
"3192040","3197200"," Buy some puts and they would print like buy a month out, three month outputs, they'd print by some"
"3197200","3199580"," month out, three month out calls on any tick or two."

"7722250","7726750"," Okay, so the issue, I mean, there's a bunch of issues."
"7726750","7731330"," First issue is you're trying to anyone that's anyone that's locked in."
"7732490","7736230"," Or being a bag holder still, just like any kind of a stock, right?"
"7736230","7737790"," It's it's fine right now. "
"7738170","7740270"," But just pretend it's like SQ as an example."
"7740490","7743070"," Any stock that's selling, right?"
"7743190","7743990"," You want sellers in?"
"7744150","7744830"," You've got a steady supply."
"7745290","7746010"," They're bag holders. "
"7746370","7747910"," They're trying to get out of their position."
"7748330","7749790"," Distribution trying to get out."
"7750470","7755310"," So we need to wear these sellers out to trade higher than where we are right now. "
"7757310","7759850"," So like we talk about right trade from zone to zone."
"7760250","7764070"," Once we encounter resistance, we let the banks do the work for us."
"7764070","7769050"," You want to see a bank step in and trade us higher than this four fifty or four forty nine,"
"7769050","7769530"," I would say. "
"7770690","7773630"," For us and then you would pick it back up and trade it higher from there."
"7779630","7782990"," And you're looking at four forty nine."
"7784270","7786430"," Was it four forty nine twenty or so?"
"7786750","7788570"," Oh nine four forty nine eleven. "
"7790510","7795290"," And then if we break above that channel, right?"
"7795290","7797150"," We get super bullish at that point."
"7797750","7801090"," IWM calls coming in February ninth two oh three C."
"7801430","7804990"," Let's look and see if IWM has any of these same issues as Spy does."
"7805810","7813880"," I think Spy's got a major issue, right?"
"7814520","7816320"," We know that the bear is going to step in here. "
"7816320","7821820"," They're going to work this on weakness on sellers above."
"7823740","7826820"," We do have more buyers and sellers today."
"7826820","7834020"," And another positive thing is our hero indicator has not been positive for all week for past five"
"7834020","7834920"," to seven trading days. "
"7834960","7840780"," We haven't had positive or a positive one here."
"7842340","7852260"," We haven't had positive hero indicator at all, which is good for Spy."
"7852260","7857580"," The next question would be if IWM can lift up the Spy above and over. "
"7858100","7859600"," And IWM looks better."
"7859960","7862720"," See, this looks much better than the Spy chart."
"7863460","7865960"," We're currently trading at two oh one ninety three. "
"7866480","7871200"," A slightly negative hero indicator."
"7872280","7874020"," But you can see on the dome over here, right?"
"7874160","7877000"," All these buyers are overwhelming sellers so far."
"7878020","7881520"," You get some nice support building on IWM. "
"7881520","7885760"," IWM can lift up the Spy regardless of the number of sellers."
"7888440","7893540"," So you're going to be looking for if IWM can break above this two oh three twenty."
"7893900","7895820"," Very bullish for all the indexes. "
"7897640","7901690"," I want to see what the reaction is here."
"7902150","7908550"," If IWM conforms or some kind of a support heading into ERs, this could be very bullish for the"
"7908550","7909290"," market in general."
"7910470","7914690"," Even though the higher hero indicator is negative here, assumption is going to be that the hero"
"7914690","7917890"," indicator is negative because of profit taking. "
"7918650","7920170"," This is still very positive here."
"7920970","7923410"," We're going to see if IWM can hang on to it."
"7923930","7926730"," Hang on to the market and lift up in market as a whole. "
"7940670","7941550"," This is all nice."
"7941950","7943010"," This is all good to see right here."
"7948820","7951820"," I'm going to turn to M.R.N.A. and I'll see you in this new supplier. "
"7951980","7956240"," Give me with the Columbia for an additional 10.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine."

"7969510","7973530"," I always love the MNR and the Pfizer pumps always out there."
"7973530","7978930"," Okay, so we're coming back to attack once more resistance on spy. "
"7979650","7981730"," There are some more calls rolling in."
"7981990","7992110"," We've got IWM February 9th, 203 C, $107,000, NCLH, February 11th, 23 C, $22,000, Rivian"

"8015430","8019890"," The key here at this moment is we're not seeing a wall of puts come in. "
"8020270","8025030"," So we are looking to see if we can break above."
"8025430","8028430"," We've been trying to break this resistance for some time."
"8030250","8032930"," Still not seeing the bears really show up at this point. "
"8033470","8034330"," We'll see what we'll see."
"8034450","8036130"," We're not seeing that negative hero indicator."
"8036890","8041590"," This is more bullish than it's been in previous and previous trading sessions. "
"8045080","8046220"," We'll see if we can get through here."
"8046420","8048560"," And if we can, we'll pick this back up and run it up higher."
"8049420","8057860"," Remember earlier to we had the Tesla by the dip moment down at the 89900. "
"8058040","8060460"," So we'll look at Tesla and see if it can break above here as well."
"8063740","8067700"," Tesla let Tesla roll load up."

"8674890","8677090"," A little bit of a dip. "
"8677270","8677790"," Just the heads up."

"8680470","8685350"," Okay, maybe just localized, you know, profit taking, as you'd expect. "
"8691620","8702940"," Not seeing the bears as of next"
"8702940","8708380"," key level for the spy to break through is going to be 44979450."
"8709020","8711080"," This is all ice here, right to 453."
"8711820","8715080"," You want to see us build a break above this to have that clear skies move. "
"8715720","8720960"," You'll really start to see some short covering above 45375."
"8722940","8725020"," View ops down here, 44717."
"8732830","8734330"," We'll look down here. "
"8735110","8736170"," Just keep our eyes on this."
"8741840","8744800"," All right, so now they get back to your chat."

"8749800","8751100"," This is going a little bit higher."
"8754890","8755870"," Sorry, I wasn't reading. "
"8756290","8760010"," I can't read sometimes when I'm making moves in the market."
"8762050","8763670"," Okay, snacks and BA calls."
"8766010","8767810"," Yeah, as you break above here. "
"8769050","8769790"," It's not."
"8770150","8774950"," So one good thing is that we have broken through the major resistance at this point."
"8776290","8777310"," Like major. "
"8777690","8784210"," Deutsche Bank, they are CEO of reiterating their target of 8% ROTE for 2022, saying ECB will have"
"8784210","8785210"," to raise interest rates."
"8785610","8788410"," CEO Deutsche Bank, Delta Bravo, Kilo trading in Germany."
"8788410","8796150"," Looks like we looked like we looked like we tagged almost to the pin where like if you if you"
"8796150","8803710"," were to snap a line on yesterday at the high on on 450 90 and then the original high way"
"8803710","8810090"," back five trading sessions at 458 12 looks like we just we just slammed on it, right?"
"8811050","8812650"," So I've got our first resistance. "
"8812930","8814230"," We're going to grind through these sellers."
"8814650","8817450"," If we can get above here, we will continue higher."
"8830780","8832660"," I'll bring up I'll bring up Amazon next. "
"8838320","8838760"," Tesla."
"8840460","8841540"," You guys want to see Tesla?"
"8843740","8844880"," You want to see the Tesla?"
"8845720","8847220"," Jess, did you buy the dip today?"
"8848100","8848100"," I"

"8865070","8867030"," know if Jess is here kind of floating around."
"8867230","8868650"," Hopefully you guys bought the dip in Tesla. "
"8871680","8878080"," Price target in Tesla as we've stated this morning, 939, 950."
"8878360","8881580"," But remember that sellers do come down at that 935 level."
"8882460","8883780"," Well, it's a traffic in here. "
"8886020","8895120"," We'll let up Amazon next for all these faithful followers, savages, a bunch of pirates."
"8897540","8904560"," I think tight here, we'll load up the Amazon."
"8906100","8907380"," Okay, let's see the VIX break. "
"8907560","8908740"," Yeah, VIX is important to break."
"8909160","8910500"," It's a lot to ask the small craps."
"8910500","8910980"," Yeah, I agree. "
"8911340","8912700"," But small craps looks better."
"8913260","8914680"," You know, the thing is underneath the surface."
"8914780","8916660"," It looks like small caps is lifting up the market. "
"8917680","8920200"," Uber Lyft with earnings for them over the next couple nights."
"8920200","8922040"," Yeah, didn't I bring didn't I show Lyft earlier?"
"8922940","8925280"," I didn't show a Uber yet."
"8929120","8936680"," The video feed froze in for anyone else to know if the video feed is frozen for you, then I"
"8936680","8945780"," would say lower some I'm running this at a at HD, like a bunch of frames per minute. "
"8945780","8950420"," If it's freezing on you, that would mean that you should turn down the quality of the feed on your"
"8950420","8950680"," end."
"8954590","8959830"," Yeah, so on your end, if it's slow for you, it means that I'm sending you too much information."
"8965230","8966570"," Yeah, book maps not frozen. "
"8967770","8971750"," So the feed is good going out on my end."
"8973150","8979670"," So just turn, look on your like your settings and turn it down because I think I'm probably pumping"
"8979670","8981190"," too much information here or something."
"8982370","8988450"," At least by 2.42, VIX coming back above now. "
"8989250","8990690"," Just getting out of sneak peets."
"8990790","8991730"," That's right sneak peets."
"8996720","8998440"," Jess owns the call float in Tesla. "
"9000520","9003340"," Yeah, let me just check real quick and see if I'm missing some here."
"9004340","9006220"," No, it's it's working fine on my end."
"9006780","9008480"," I'm positive it's working on my end. "
"9009160","9013340"," So if you guys are getting frozen screen, what you do is just go out of your settings and you'll"
"9013340","9015660"," see that I'm streaming in like 1080p HD."
"9016280","9019540"," Just means that your download speed is not is not accounting for that."
"9024180","9029160"," All right, saying likely reverse here, rejecting the other 20 ma for our bouncy of 50. "
"9029480","9033600"," Yeah, this is um, we are at the space where we are at the place."
"9034320","9040160"," We are at the place where we should get a rejection here, but I will say to you, you've never"
"9040160","9044800"," had this week past five days, right, five train sessions, you've not had your listening to trade"
"9044800","9045520"," indicator."
"9046860","9049400"," We've not had more buyers and sellers. "
"9049760","9051180"," So I just want to be aware of that."
"9051300","9052720"," If you're a bear out there, okay, at this moment."
"9054220","9056640"," Oh, it does not mean we don't reject here. "
"9056740","9063320"," It does not mean that we don't reject off for 53 or 456 or 460 for you to get truly"
"9063320","9064880"," uber duper bear or bullish."
"9065200","9067180"," You have to break above for 60."
"9067820","9072000"," Otherwise, all the LA wave weirdos are saying that we'll come back down and revisit lows. "
"9072740","9079440"," We'll hit like 460 or lower like we call it 446, 460 and then we'll trade lower to a lower"
"9079440","9084700"," number that would invite the CPI numbers to be negative for OPEC."
"9084860","9087480"," So we trade back lower down below."
"9089680","9094460"," Remember, we talked all week long that bulls can't give it up here. "
"9094560","9100080"," If bulls give it up here, we trade way lower like 413, 415 somewhere down in there."
"9103660","9104540"," We keep talking about that."
"9104680","9106240"," This is do or die for the bulls. "
"9109640","9111820"," And maybe it comes in small caps."
"9112380","9116460"," It looks like small caps is probably who's going to have to do it, right?"
"9116660","9126280"," You lose the oomph from big caps reporting and then small caps winds up lifting up all markets."
"9129730","9131570"," And we're breaking through right now. "
"9131610","9135910"," There is resistance here going back five trading sessions."
"9136550","9140850"," And if we can break above this, it's bullish in the short term for shit, sure."
"9155980","9161120"," You will start to see squeezes happen if we continue to trade higher here. "
"9161600","9171390"," A little bit of ice"
"9171390","9171990"," above here."
"9172750","9183690"," Be careful of this right here at 449.94 .450."

"9459450","9460590"," My I'll make a good point, right?"
"9460810","9462270"," 10, 15 minutes after Euro close."
"9462830","9463990"," Often the turning point lately."
"9469380","9470040"," Oh, yeah. "
"9470280","9470780"," There we go."

"9478020","9479100"," You didn't hear with me, bro?"
"9482860","9485860"," You're going to get evil and you're going to, yeah, I know your room was like, I'm just waiting for"
"9485860","9489760"," 455 so we can, so we can, uh, hey, what's up, Barrow?"
"9491220","9494040"," All the bears piling in so they can see if it's time to start shorting. "
"9497720","9498540"," How's everybody doing?"
"9501380","9503720"," All the bears starting to show up now, like we're at 450."
"9505300","9507000"," Best spy pump room, baby."
"9512520","9517320"," So if you're, if you're paying attention that comes off this morning at 5.30 in the morning or 6"
"9517320","9520280"," a.m., uh, I know who was paying attention. "
"9520480","9521380"," Euro Boomer was."
"9521800","9522840"," He was paying attention."
"9523320","9529360"," He was paying attention this morning. "
"9532140","9533140"," Good morning, Miro."
"9533580","9534560"," Yeah, we traded up, bro."
"9534780","9535260"," We traded up to 450. "
"9537000","9537920"," I've got some call expansion."
"9538460","9542540"," February 9th, 452C, $62,000 and spy just rolled in."
"9543100","9545320"," A whole bunch of BAC calls just killing it. "
"9546060","9547840"," Tagging above it, 450 right now."
"9550880","9552120"," Is there my boots?"
"9553040","9553780"," Why you pumps by?"
"9559440","9562580"," Got that spy ripping action over here at 450."
"9563560","9566800"," Probably not the place for you as a retail trader to add a call. "
"9567180","9568400"," Add calls here at this 450."
"9569680","9570860"," Probably not the place."
"9571760","9572960"," Doesn't even want to trade higher. "
"9573560","9576700"," Probably not the place for you or I to rent calls."
"9578100","9587800"," But we are ready to QQQ February 11th, 58C, spy, February 9th, 452C,"
"9588400","9591100"," looking for the pump, looking for the pump."
"9599010","9600250"," Looking for the pump. "
"9601410","9603150"," We're going to see if we can break above here."
"9606040","9607540"," I mean, I will say this, right?"
"9607740","9609960"," We're going to say this before any other day."
"9610520","9615440"," Last five trading days, it has not looked this bullish at any moment. "
"9617280","9619160"," It is 11.38 in the afternoon."
"9619220","9623780"," It could be like we traded sideways, roping some bulls and spending some more money."
"9624200","9626960"," A million US dollars, a little above the consensus estimate. "
"9629720","9631060"," Trapped some bulls up in here."
"9633660","9636380"," Apples get all kinds of good news coming out today."
"9637500","9640720"," Apples to offer better benefits to part-time retail workers. "
"9641580","9646460"," Going to offer sick leave, vacation time, parental benefits, retail store employees."
"9647900","9652680"," More calls coming in on Apple February 18th, 172.5C, $190,000."
"9653900","9656620"," Open bunch of calls coming in, open all day long today. "
"9657180","9663680"," February 25th, 10C, rack them up for a half million dollar split across a bunch of blocks and all"
"9663680","9665820"," block trades on open."
"9669660","9672800"," So let's see what happens around here to be in trade this higher."
"9679210","9683530"," I do want to point out that 450.99 was the high from yesterday. "
"9689240","9692040"," You'd say that that's where shorts are laying in wait."
"9692580","9699000"," So if we trade to 450.99, you would start to squeeze bears."
"9699120","9703680"," They are going to want to step in once more if they're at that break even actually at break even"
"9703680","9706700"," with fees, probably somewhere around here at this point. "
"9713860","9716440"," With the apple slaves in China, they get more time off."
"9716780","9719960"," Yet they said that they removed all those nets in China."
"9720680","9730380"," Yeah, we've got to resistance above"
"9730380","9743070"," here at 450.44 and then 450.99. I'm"
"9743070","9744290"," going to put some music on right now. "
"9746150","9750670"," The bears are definitely getting itchy right now without a doubt."
"9751670","9755430"," If they got the exact top four, we got out right around here, right?"
"9755430","9761630"," I think we got out yesterday right around 450.47 or something."
"9763390","9768290"," I don't remember exactly when we got out of our lungs yesterday, but this is when you know day"
"9768290","9770870"," traders were selling yesterday, if you guys are going to recall, right?"
"9771610","9773430"," We're selling this right around here yesterday. "
"9774570","9776570"," The bears stepped right in and took over."
"9777490","9779750"," It's be constant so that if where we are in the market."
"9782450","9785050"," This is not the place that we did live in, if you're a bull. "
"9785470","9790090"," And trust me, if you sell your calls right now, you're not the bank selling their calls."
"9790230","9792770"," We want to see the banks stay in here and take it higher."
"9794410","9799110"," I want you to see down below this little bit thicker cell area right here. "
"9799230","9802210"," Over showing you a little bit lighter on the call side over here."
"9803750","9806070"," We'll look at the hero indicator."
"9807210","9810310"," It's coming down a little bit, starting to break slightly lower into the cell side. "
"9812770","9819530"," That doesn't mean that we don't go up, but it does mean we're not movers and market shakers, right?"
"9820550","9821530"," Take our money and run."
"9829830","9830910"," Oh yeah, I like belief strings."
"9848080","9850000"," Yeah, get out of the calls if you can. "
"9850080","9850860"," Nothing we don't trade higher."
"9851080","9852920"," Just take your money and run, right?"
"9853280","9854360"," And then just take a look at the market."
"9855060","9859290"," All right, here we go. "
"9859390","9861190"," How that's like I'm adding the shorts now."
"9861610","9862330"," It's sickos."
"9865190","9867850"," UAL calls every 1845C. "
"9868390","9871110"," Still lots of calls coming in on tickers under 30 bucks."
"9871350","9877110"," I mean, something fifth, they're going to 50 and 50 and under right now, but calls all day long"
"9877110","9882530"," across the entire market at night of UM on tickers held in IWM just that alone."
"9882530","9886870"," Just the premium kick on IWM is lifting all markets this morning. "
"9895850","9899730"," I'm going to say that I don't think we sell off today."
"9900310","9905650"," I think it's going to be more of consolidate trade higher, consolidate trade higher."
"9906430","9909230"," That's what it looks like, my honest opinion. "
"9910150","9911850"," We'll look at Amazon real quick."
"9918520","9920340"," And don't listen to what I have to say."
"9923000","9929780"," But this does look somewhat different than the past few trading days. "
"9930700","9931540"," I'm unsure."
"9932600","9938920"," This could be a computer buying to raise the market up because of all the money coming in a bit"
"9938920","9939700"," into small caps."
"9943270","9952150"," You can see Amazon has some heavy resistance at 3198, but also some support here at 3178. "
"9966360","9968980"," All right, so I'm probably going to do is I'm probably going to take a break here."
"9969440","9971300"," I'm going to take a just let out a yawn."
"9971460","9972080"," That was a long morning. "
"9973540","9979940"," AMC calls February 11th, 17C, $23,000, $21,000, pretty decent algo score."
"9983540","9991680"," 3170 is the support, the intraday support on the Amazon war buyers and sellers on Amazon"
"9991680","9994480"," 3200."
"10012620","10014800"," Lots of blue sky though above Amazon here. "
"10015460","10018440"," If Amazon breaks through this 3200, watch out airs."
"10019180","10022980"," So we're right back where we were yesterday, basically, on the market."
"10025720","10030740"," If I don't even get lifted up by all this money coming into it, it'll lift all the whole entire"
"10030740","10031400"," market up, right?"
"10031540","10032200"," You guys, I'll get that. "
"10038580","10041380"," If you're a bear, you might want to wait a minute."
"10045660","10047000"," Be careful on shorting here."
"10049320","10055860"," I'd be looking towards IWM as a as, hey, do we short here or not?"
"10064260","10065280"," Do we lean in here?"
"10067960","10070380"," I don't know what I'm about to break through right now. "
"10070860","10073280"," And there's not a lot of shorts on IWM."
"10074000","10076440"," There is on spy, but on IWM, there's not."
"10078880","10088780"," End calls, talk about pen earlier, February 11th, 49C, $67,000, spy calls, February 9th,"
"10089120","10093560"," 445C for a half million, Las Vegas Sands calls. "

"10183980","10186720"," lots of consolidation and they're coiling right now as well."
"10187400","10196780"," They haven't participated as much today, but it is interesting to keep an eye on B.A. Also of note"
"10196780","10206100"," would be the minor resistance levels at 450.47 and 451.01 or 0.99. These are yesterday's resistance"
"10206100","10208640"," levels on the spy."
"10234080","10236300"," It's all traffic here to like 453. "
"10237660","10239560"," You guys want to see where the traffic is?"
"10243500","10245800"," So this is all volatility here, right?"
"10246120","10252120"," Goes to 454.70. Let's see how much whiter this is right here."
"10252880","10256280"," 451.15, you'll start to squeeze higher."

"11080660","11086240"," But we are pin striking at 450.47. This is a place where bears or where shorts, right?"
"11087300","11092540"," There, let's say the best short took short yesterday right around this zone."
"11093180","11103140"," 450.47, 451.01. They're going to have to unwind their shorts here or load up even"

"11190690","11193330"," We do have bonds, right?"
"11193790","11197230"," There could be some weakness between like 12.30 and 1."
"11198050","11199730"," Or even at the 1 o'clock hour. "
"11200650","11204830"," The bond market could be a trigger to sell a little bit this afternoon."

"12620780","12628520"," The German finance minister is sending one to reach 60% that's a GDP in the second half of this."
"12628620","12629500"," Yeah, I don't think you'll do it either. "
"12631680","12632640"," I like India."
"12632640","12633720"," India loves gold too."
"12651840","12653600"," Yeah, I want to talk to you guys about Ford. "
"12653900","12655760"," Do you guys want to hear it?"
"12655800","12658100"," Do you guys know everything that's going on with Ford and GM right now?"
"12658840","12663060"," So I'm living and I moved to Michigan to buy in flip houses."
"12665860","12675540"," And there's this huge railroad in downtown Detroit that's being converted to EV development."
"12676040","12680380"," And they actually have one of the longest roads in the U.S. with EV charging on it right now. "
"12680500","12687820"," A long road, I think, where they're testing, the company is testing, charging EV cars as they"
"12687820","12688060"," drive."
"12690180","12695520"," There's a publication in Detroit called Crain's Business Daily or something Crain's Detroit."
"12695780","12696460"," I'm not sure what it's called. "
"12696600","12698140"," It's part of Crain's anyways."
"12698140","12706080"," And they did an article this week about the EV business here in Detroit and Ford is looking for..."
"12706080","12711520"," It's because he's going to say, iterating, they'll do what's necessary for their 2% inflation goal."
"12712960","12714160"," I don't know how much this is public. "
"12714600","12720860"," I don't think it's not public, but there's a non-infamous..."
"12724060","12727980"," Ford's not emphasizing EV as being part of Ford."
"12727980","12728880"," They're going to spin it off."
"12729440","12734380"," And they're building this railroad in Detroit to be an EV, a center of development for small"
"12734380","12734740"," companies. "
"12735480","12738140"," So one of the things about Ford and GM is that they've..."
"12738140","12743800"," They're watching more spy calls come in February 9th, 450C, 251,000 dollars."
"12744660","12747160"," So he's looking like a company like GM or Ford."
"12748080","12749420"," Everything used to be in-house. "
"12749740","12757460"," And now it is like a shell of a company and then they have lots of engineering firms and just"
"12757460","12762080"," small engineering firms that surround the city of Detroit that build all these parts and develop"
"12762080","12764700"," all these parts for Ford and GM vehicles."
"12765580","12774820"," And so they're trying to build that same kind of a system with attracting EV developers into the"
"12774820","12775780"," Detroit area currently."
"12777760","12782500"," And they're talking about spinning off EV from their main company. "
"12782740","12792250"," If this is Ford specifically, into development and attracting Ford companies."
"12794650","12796170"," Oh, so I didn't even see this."
"12796330","12798110"," 21-year-hours ago, I guess, Fortune now. "
"12798610","12802690"," I knew that we were talking about this yesterday but it was the talk in Detroit right now that the"
"12802690","12805750"," Ford CEO has just made a convincing case to break his company up and go full EV."
"12807330","12807690"," Yeah."
"12808030","12808970"," So that's already out and about. "
"12809270","12810390"," I don't need to talk about that then."
"12810490","12811210"," I'll just stop talking."
"12812430","12814290"," It's a big talk though in Detroit right now. "
"12814290","12819770"," And we have a bunch of engineering schools here in Michigan and he's talking about wanting"
"12819770","12829310"," engineers to shift to software engineering degrees rather than mechanical engineering degrees."
"12831050","12837030"," And so they're talking about trying to make Detroit a hub of EV development."
"12843890","12846410"," Which has been an argument that I've had years ago, right?"
"12849590","12858410"," If Ford and GM actually take it seriously that they would have a real go at the EV market. "
"12865580","12867200"," But it looks like it's made the news yesterday."
"12868000","12870860"," So this is all pointless information to be vain to you guys out there."
"12880560","12882860"," I'm gonna try to look for a conversation that was in about this. "
"12883520","12884200"," So it just heads up."
"12884360","12886080"," Lots more calls coming in right now."
"12886400","12887960"," Apple calls by the buttload. "
"12888610","12894020"," Gut AMD calls 916-22-180C, $600,000."
"12894320","12897520"," JPM calls, February 11th, 160C."
"12898180","12903500"," IWM baby, February 18th, 205C, $1.5 million. "
"12908260","12911160"," VIX is gonna fall off a cliff right now."
"12915310","12917190"," Market's getting a huge bid."
"12917650","12919450"," If you are bearish, be careful here. "
"12920510","12923110"," Could start to see some major squeezing take place soon."
"12928420","12929840"," I don't think it's a rug pull."
"12930220","12933280"," This looks so far as I'm looking at it right now. "
"12933980","12935500"," This does not look like a rug pull."
"12935560","12939680"," This looks like it's going to push back bears."
"12939840","12941640"," I think that nobody's seeing it coming. "
"12941640","12943400"," It's coming from IWM today."
"12944340","12946060"," IWM will lift the market up."
"12951180","12952620"," It's tough to say right here. "
"12953100","12956020"," I realize that we're at this point where it's dangerous."
"12956720","12961840"," Facebook calls, February 11th, 225C, $299,000."
"12966090","12969810"," We are in a perfect spot for bears to step in currently. "
"12972090","12975910"," For some resist, I mean, we're getting so close to 451-01."
"12976350","12980130"," At the same time, we could really start squeezing at this point as well."
"12982830","12984590"," This that we've been squeezing all day. "
"12984590","12990350"," This is at this melt-up that you've seen from pretty much from right around 447-68."
"12990790","12992490"," Has been a melt-up all day long."
"12993030","12994470"," You could see it continue at this point. "
"13002860","13008680"," So we're looking at call expansion on IWM specifically, which does move all markets."
"13014970","13017750"," 118,000 contracts on 450C."
"13018550","13021250"," They're up to $2.60 now. "
"13034000","13044000"," It spies up to 450.74. This is the do-or-die for bears in terms of any shorts"
"13044000","13045280"," that came out yesterday."
"13046100","13056000"," Full retracement of yesterday at 450.90. 451-01 looks like 450.99. The pin"
"13056000","13057040"," strike was on yesterday."
"13062560","13065220"," Tagging on 450 is 74 currently. "
"13067260","13069460"," Light sellers above right here."
"13069760","13071740"," 450-103 looks like light sellers."
"13078480","13080000"," Take a look at the Hero Indicator. "
"13081520","13084380"," I'm bringing my camera back online here."
"13084700","13085660"," You guys can see me or not."
"13086480","13087620"," You guys can see me?"
"13087760","13088120"," Okay, cool. "
"13089380","13090580"," So 450..."
"13091140","13099240"," We have a little bit of ice above here, 450.98. We'll look higher and see where the price target"
"13099240","13099740"," above is."
"13101520","13108520"," Still in this volatility zone, we'll expand or contract the whole market."
"13108800","13109560"," Just take a look and see. "
"13113540","13115880"," That same ice volatility here."
"13116700","13119020"," Raised up a little bit to a 455."
"13119520","13121100"," It was slightly lower, I think, earlier. "
"13139430","13148060"," Price target above is $4.60.87. You can see back here at $12.34. Looks like buyers stepped higher"
"13148060","13155420"," at $4.45.85. Back at the $12.30. I'll still be conscious of the bond auction."
"13156520","13157500"," Comes up in 20 minutes."
"13162750","13165590"," Should see a melt-up effect at this point or a squeezing effect. "
"13166170","13167490"," More spy calls coming in."
"13168290","13170070"," February 9th for 4C."

"13318220","13325140"," 451.11. When we get to 450.20 is my question. "
"13325740","13327620"," Get a big fat yellow line up there for it."
"13329820","13331060"," Can we trade up there?"
"13337530","13338790"," 460 is your target."
"13339490","13340230"," That's what you can see. "

"13722920","13725900"," So I'm going to look for a tag here and we'll take some more calls on Spy. "
"13731080","13735000"," I mean, I thought today is that we trade up to 452, 453."
"13735460","13739580"," If we can get the call expansion, which we're seeing right now in the market, that we should see"
"13739580","13740060"," that today."
"13741140","13746300"," Now, if we start to, it's $12.47. So if we start to roll over between 1 and 2 PM,"
"13746720","13750040"," we expect another run up into the bell. "
"13751380","13753620"," Or we call it would mean there's two choices, right?"
"13753800","13754860"," We trade right in this area."
"13755720","13759100"," We cool off into the close and we trade higher into tomorrow."
"13761720","13772710"," And the price target above for me is probably $4.56 or $4.60. Yeah,"

"13774050","13775650"," No worries, Coop, I got your brother."

"13789300","13789920"," I just want to go back."
"13790080","13790380"," Oh, yeah."
"13790580","13791900"," Look at that Roblox smashing, bashing. "
"13793300","13798680"," That's a way to see the sellers that are kicking in on the Spy real quick."
"13799020","13802060"," Okay, we did have a nice big red bar above here."
"13802580","13803920"," Some sellers stepping in. "
"13804480","13809140"," Here are indicators going down on the Spy right now currently, even though we have more buyers than"
"13809140","13809360"," sellers."
"13811400","13812820"," So get it Roblox real quick."
"13815360","13817260"," More buyers than sellers than Roblox. "
"13817580","13819460"," I love this ticker, by the way, just like Jimmy Kramer."

"13825470","13828950"," Trade at $64.16, a little bit of resistance above at $65. "
"13830090","13837290"," Price target above, $69, just keep your eyes on this one here."
"13837370","13839850"," You can take the trade to $65, pick it back up to $69."
"13840630","13847830"," A little bit more resistance at $70, but $69 sneakers are in here sneaking around. "
"13848630","13851090"," And $75 is the next price target."
"13852570","13854730"," Real sellers are above at $80 though."
"13855350","13856450"," Look at this Dom right here. "
"13856450","13858350"," This is where the real sellers are, $80."
"13859790","13863150"," I want to know where to buy the dip on your bait bait."
"13863410","13867490"," You're basically on the dip bro, you're $62, pretty decent support. "
"13869850","13871630"," $60, I'm very bullish here."
"13872170","13877990"," And just so you can see the real buyers are at $60 on Roblox."
"13878670","13880130"," What was the next one you were asking for?"
"13881090","13883210"," Well, you said you were asking for Roblox. "
"13883410","13884010"," What was the other one?"
"13885510","13886850"," Well, then I put him in over here."
"13887050","13890650"," MU, MU."
"13893390","13895110"," Winky, you're going to trade this with me, brother?"
"13899630","13900790"," Reduce MU next. "
"13902190","13904550"," Nice support kicking in right here on the spy."
"13905390","13907430"," This is on the 21-day support."
"13909370","13912810"," Let's scroll this down and see where there's any other buyers down below. "
"13914590","13915510"," Just traffic."
"13918650","13919530"," Just traffic."
"13926060","13935480"," Some puts again on AMC 225, 15.5, Donkey Kong calls January 20th, 50C for $67,000"
"13935480","13936200"," NCRs. "
"13936520","13938240"," And I don't even still catch it a bit right now."

"13947790","13950850"," $83.92, more sellers than buyers."
"13951210","13951870"," Careful on MU. "
"13953530","13955270"," This is not looking bullish."
"13955590","13961250"," It could trade higher, but for all intents and purposes, if you aren't able to be through the $83 "
"13961250","13964870",".84 mark, your next target of about $83."
"13965530","13968090"," You got traffic from $84 to $85. "
"13969610","13970990"," Next move hires to $88."
"13972030","13974430"," We'll look at it on a bigger scale here."
"13981040","13986120"," It's not really big traffic, actually, the bigger scheme of things or real sellers are above. "
"13986800","13987720"," Price target above is $200."
"13988680","13989640"," It's MU to $100."

"14036350","14037550"," Starting to trail off. "

"14042090","14054230"," Let's take a look right here at $12.41, $12.41. That"
"14054230","14055070"," was kind of match up."
"14057390","14062170"," See if we can see this hero indicator flip a little bit. "
"14070700","14072380"," I'm missing a bunch of what you guys are saying."
"14073720","14081290"," It was on smashing $3,200."

"14103360","14107280"," Like he's been loading puts over a $4.51. Thanks for the heads up, Winky. "
"14109180","14110140"," Only it's a bad play."

"14119220","14120220"," Or whatever that is."
"14120380","14121120"," Yeah, $40,000. "
"14121200","14121880"," It's now lower."
"14125520","14133480"," I'm going to wait to see if that bond auction comes in for the threes at one o'clock."

"14408440","14409780"," Yeah, BP had some great flow today. "
"14411420","14412520"," I feel like a BP."

"14462000","14464720"," calls for summertime or start of summer."
"14465100","14470480"," So the BP calls today that I saw were June 17th, 40C for a million bucks. "
"14471120","14475360"," So the time right, I've got multiple accounts that I trade on."
"14476220","14482460"," And I'll put calls out for, let's say, June, and I'll put them on an account where I don't check"
"14482460","14482940"," them every day."
"14483220","14486420"," So they're out of sight of the mind for the general fluctuations of the market. "
"14490230","14498570"," And then I'll just check back and see if there's still interest in those calls."
"14502810","14504630"," There's no here indicator for this ticker."
"14506270","14510110"," I'll just check to make sure that there's still interest in the positioning that I have farther"

"14812280","14814180"," I don't know, 51% of a lot at the high."
"14816200","14816960"," Realistic 20."

"14827800","14832660"," The day the government doesn't show up is gonna be a bad day. "
"14842170","14843950"," Yeah, XLF ain't doing shit right now."
"14843970","14844690"," It's going up, isn't it?"
"14845390","14861870"," I miss"
"14861870","14862970"," what you guys are saying up here."
"14863030","14863970"," I'm trying to scroll through. "
"14872560","14874760"," Oh, it's on CNBC, the BP flow."
"14886190","14893840"," Yeah, it's the only central bank saying that they're now considering how much or how to mitigate"

"14917850","14920010"," Yeah, it's not a bad bond auction."
"14920490","14922450"," They showed up today for sure."
"14923330","14925330"," So 52 was what it was prior to. "
"14925550","14934840"," Today was 51.5. It's definitely more money in the market."
"14935440","14938460"," Watching right now, lots of bid come in on IWM."
"14938680","14944300"," And once again, American Airlines calls May 20th, 22C, AMC calls. "
"14948610","14950830"," You'd see a cliff drop right away."
"14954210","14957990"," You see if I can click on this and get some more information on the bonds today."
"14958550","14962390"," Basically, you're looking for, you know, if TLT starts cranking, you're going to start to see the"
"14962390","14963150"," market rollover. "
"14963510","14965290"," So I'm watching TLT right now."
"14965370","14967110"," It looks like it's getting a slight bid."
"14967570","14968230"," It's not a big one. "
"14969770","14975390"," You start to see sometimes there's direct and indirect correlation on TLT, but you are seeing a"
"14975390","14977570"," little bit in TLT that should roll over."
"14979210","14982490"," That should roll over tech."
"14983330","14986290"," Which unpack tech and roll tech over slightly. "
"14987690","14989950"," Sometimes there's convergence on TLT and spy."
"14992210","14994790"," But currently it's correlating quite well."
"14998580","15003420"," Some of a bond auction comes about to typically just look at the TLT and see if it catches a"
"15003420","15004060"," bid moves up. "
"15004540","15008920"," And if it does, you'll see a rollover in the queues and in the spy."
"15022670","15031160"," It calls on spy February 9, 451 C for $400,000, 378,000, I guess."
"15040110","15040490"," Let's see. "
"15051730","15053410"," Slight bump in the road so far."
"15057300","15062400"," Price target below would be for remember that from earlier today."
"15063340","15069340"," We have more AAL calls, by the way, August 19, 1922 C $66,000. "
"15069840","15074380"," If we do roll over here, remember from earlier today, that number that we talked about originally"
"15074380","15078120"," this morning, I think that was $4.49 or something."
"15078940","15079440"," Let's take a look at that."
"15079660","15080960"," We'll bring that back up here. "
"15081760","15084500"," That was where the original resistance I think was."
"15095100","15096320"," Yeah, it's not VWAP."
"15104120","15106200"," Let's see if we can find anything down here. "
"15109760","15112560"," Sometimes we can find out where the buyers are hiding."
"15114320","15115480"," What's this right here?"
"15121160","15121720"," Nothing."
"15127130","15128610"," I was in here. "
"15128890","15131070"," It was like $4.49.07 or something."
"15138310","15144070"," Let's VWAP $4.48. Let's see if we can find any hiding buyers down below."
"15151490","15153030"," That's the original right there. "
"15161350","15167490"," I swear it was slightly down like $4.49 or something earlier in the broadcast."
"15169150","15170710"," It's down here, right here."
"15171990","15175750"," $4,8.95, but I don't think we, I don't know. "
"15178010","15181510"," I don't see him down below."
"15184170","15186370"," I see him still right where we are."
"15191750","15198610"," I'm going to take him in a try and buy this dip and there we are. "
"15199430","15205930"," $4.33 or down like $1.06. The last pump they were down like $90."
"15206490","15208370"," I think about them for $0.92 or something."
"15214380","15215200"," You can throw some money at it. "
"15230380","15232020"," $1.12 in the afternoon."
"15240840","15242180"," I'd like to buy those."
"15242340","15242900"," I'd like to buy some. "
"15243060","15247660"," I'm interested in the $4.53s expiring on February 9th."

"16478650","16482630"," I will average in to 2 if we dip lower to 2."
"16483270","16486890"," And I'm going to look for the trade to go to 453 in the bell."
"16488490","16491710"," My stop loss is this channel below. "

"16576119","16580740"," We're in a bullish context for today and probably tomorrow."
"16582000","16587200"," So if you see the post that I've made this morning, we're either going to top out around here, up"

"16605820","16608580"," Today, yesterday we traded up right up to the top of that channel. "
"16609160","16612680"," So I'm bullish on the market for today and probably tomorrow."
"16612960","16619900"," And I also thinking about this in the perspective of when where do they want this market to be,"
"16620000","16621580"," when if we get a bad CPI number."
"16625060","16626320"," So we'll see what happens here. "
"16626560","16630340"," The hero indicator is now off the charts, it's up to 16,000."

"16956730","16961970"," Um, but I can see that it's like right there."
"16962230","16964950"," Like you can, you can grow a business out of this shit. "
"16965610","16966890"," Like sell classes to people."
"16967110","16968150"," We sell this to sell that."
"16969690","16971170"," It's all kinds of stupid shit. "
"16971170","16977210"," The stock is going down and we're all like, if I'm buying, I don't know, square with you and you're"
"16977210","16978330"," buying square with me."
"16978650","16979870"," And the square has a bad day."
"16980430","16983650"," We cry together on stream together. "
"16984190","16985730"," You know, that kind of stupid shit."
"16987310","16991850"," And then, uh, meanwhile, I'm selling you pilot pens."
"16992330","16997930"," You know, I'm just making money on, uh, all kinds of other shit than actually investing in trading. "
"16998610","16999410"," It did so fucked up."
"17001170","17001890"," It's eye opening."
"17002450","17003990"," I'll, I'll give you that eye opening. "
"17004190","17004710"," I'll show you guys."
"17004790","17006050"," You guys want to see the emails sometimes."
"17009190","17010630"," Just weave shit in casually. "
"17012590","17017430"," I'll show you guys the, uh, yeah, the bourbon makers, I'd fucking take that."
"17017610","17024530"," So I'd take that, uh, I'd take that, um, I'd take that, uh, sponsorship."
"17025170","17027570"," Like a bourbon sponsorship all day long. "
"17028230","17030450"," I wouldn't even, I would, that one, I would take it a minute."
"17030450","17035710"," But it's like, uh, it's like these, it's like these, they want me to, I'll show you guys the emails"
"17035710","17036270"," one of these days."
"17036830","17038490"," So you can see what some of these fucking guys are making. "
"17039550","17041410"," Fun guys are making my, making bank."
"17042230","17043710"," Selling all kinds of stupid shit."
"17044730","17046750"," But whatever, they never doing it. "
"17047650","17048870"," Maybe, I don't know."
"17049590","17050290"," I don't think so."
"17051550","17054350"," I think I'm gonna have to hand off the sub to somebody at some point. "
"17055310","17056750"," My, my, I had a second thought."
"17056830","17058530"," I was telling Joe donut earlier this morning."
"17059090","17062610"," I was saying that, um, I was saying it would be super fucking cool. "
"17063490","17064870"," This would be super fucking cool."
"17065190","17066690"," So like, I don't do any advertising."
"17066910","17067510"," I don't do anything. "
"17067890","17070090"," Like nothing with Google, nothing with YouTube."
"17071190","17072150"," None of that shit."
"17072310","17073610"," I don't do anything with any private companies. "
"17073750","17076870"," Private companies contacted me like every week and getting contacted."
"17078030","17079270"," And I'm saying no to all of them."
"17079470","17080130"," I don't even respond. "
"17080930","17084030"," But, uh, what's crazy, what I was talking to Joe about doing."
"17084910","17086990"," I was like, I should buy a fucking house here."
"17087550","17093090"," So when I, I moved to, I moved to Michigan to buy, uh, cheap houses and then renovate them and"
"17093090","17093550"," flip them. "
"17094150","17096590"," Or turn them into Airbnb's or rentals and shit like that."
"17097150","17103730"," So like I moved here and I'm like, I didn't know a bunch about, like I've done, like, I've done"
"17103730","17105430"," like labor when I was younger."
"17106110","17107770"," I could go to college and shit. "
"17108250","17109470"," Buddy's father was a roofer."
"17110350","17112010"," Another buddy's father did this."
"17112790","17119710"," So I'd spend like a, uh, a winter holiday or a summer helping my buddy's parents out or whatever. "
"17120270","17124010"," I never did any kind of construction work in my life."
"17125590","17128710"," And, uh, start buying houses here."
"17128830","17130210"," I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. "
"17131630","17136590"," So the first thing that I did when I moved to Michigan was, uh, start, I bought a house and"
"17136590","17139970"," started doing the work, but I hired some guys to help me with it."
"17139970","17144090"," Uh, some, just like a handyman to help, to help me with that kind of stuff."
"17144370","17149210"," And they taught me how to build a house, like how to demo a house down and nothing, build it"
"17149210","17149730"," up from scratch. "
"17151230","17153130"," And so I've done a bunch of those here in Detroit."
"17153590","17159770"," And I was like, man, it'd be kind of cool to like, uh, buy a house and flip it while"
"17159770","17162570"," trading live every day."
"17164830","17166990"," Inside all of these local guys are super cool. "
"17167570","17169110"," And another thing would be kind of cool."
"17171570","17175090"," Some kind of an alternative to, uh, yeah, this old day trader."
"17176010","17182150"," We solely, we totally fucking different, you know, do interviews with, with, uh, with, uh,"
"17182810","17184230"," construction guys and shit like that. "
"17185250","17187590"," Watching some BTU calls come in again."
"17188650","17191650"," BTU February 18th, 16C for $12,000."
"17192350","17194610"," We had a little bit of weakness and open. "
"17195310","17199310"," Looks like some more holes are stepping in open February 25th, 11C."
"17200570","17202390"," Some bears are getting all fired up."
"17202490","17208090"," They just bought, uh, February 11th, spy February 11th, 446 P for $231,000. "
"17208610","17213270"," Bears are like, take me home, take me home, sell it into the clothes."
"17213510","17218290"," Bears right now, if you're looking at the spy, all they want is to see the spy just burn to"
"17218290","17218950"," the depths of hell."
"17219610","17220430"," That's all they want. "
"17221670","17222550"," Sick bastards."
"17226740","17228060"," Yeah, that would be cool, wouldn't it?"
"17228760","17229940"," Like, it would be totally cool."
"17231960","17233600"," Well, I'm not watching you guys right now. "
"17233600","17234180"," Let me scroll up."
"17236120","17237140"," I think it'd be super cool."
"17237340","17239880"," Like, would I do a P done sponsorship?"
"17240380","17240600"," No. "
"17244860","17245980"," It'd be kind of cool, right?"
"17246360","17247720"," Like, I know it's really weird."
"17247860","17249720"," They got this, uh, I got to tell you, this is really cool."
"17250940","17255180"," There's this, like, story that they tell in Detroit, that they tell the whole country, they're"
"17255180","17259520"," like, oh, Detroit's a, you guys watch videos and shit on, uh, on YouTube. "
"17259900","17265480"," Like, Detroit looks like a bomb, bombed out husk, and it just, it just isn't that."
"17266040","17270040"," It's more of a play to attract new business and investment into the city."
"17270480","17272340"," So they're going to play that card as long as they can. "
"17272780","17277520"," But the city has come a long way, a long way in investment."
"17278320","17283740"," And the homes here were, I mean, they were, they were giving homes away free here at one point, but"
"17283740","17289340"," you used to be able, and I guess once a year you can, you can buy houses at a auction."
"17290220","17294380"," For fairly cheap, anywhere from, like, I think 500 bucks for a, for a shit dump. "
"17294640","17298580"," But you can pay upwards of 50, 60, 70, $100,000 for mansions."
"17299080","17300900"," The mansions used to go for like 1500 bucks."
"17301100","17303260"," Now though, now they go for like 50, 60, 100 grand. "
"17305020","17306760"," 150 grand, depending on how old they are."
"17306900","17312700"," But we could totally buy a house and, uh, what we could do is, I was thinking about this, this"
"17312700","17313540"," is a crazy thought."
"17314140","17314520"," Totally crazy. "
"17315580","17319500"," But what I could do is, we could, um, see the beers want this down here."
"17319600","17321500"," They want this 445, 443 or so."
"17321800","17323280"," Um, I don't know that they get it, dude. "
"17323840","17326120"," Bulls are stepping in with a, here indicator is bull."
"17326260","17327640"," So you got to have to warn you bears right now."
"17328900","17331620"," You got to warn you, bulls are stepping in. "
"17332920","17333820"," But it'd be super cool."
"17333820","17334900"," Like we could buy a house, right?"
"17335600","17339840"," Or I could buy a house and we could do the rehab on it."
"17341100","17342000"," Buy a cool house. "
"17343580","17345980"," You guys could like name rooms or something."
"17347720","17354840"," And, uh, I don't know, I wonder if we could like turn it into something like, maybe we could do"
"17354840","17356800"," something like a donut of, it's like donation."
"17356940","17362340"," Like, maybe you could turn into like an office, a house, a nice old school house, turns like an"
"17362340","17364580"," office space for, or donate it to. "
"17365000","17372580"," There's a, there's some, there's some, uh, some stock market, gurus, they're not really gurus."
"17372820","17381060"," There's, there are a couple, like not hedge funds, but I don't know, like finance related startups"
"17381060","17388320"," and Detroit based on, uh, helping people to trade, helping people learn how to invest."
"17388900","17389460"," I have to look them up. "
"17389540","17390440"," I don't know their names right now."
"17390520","17395260"," I've got my head, but I bet you could do like an outreach program for locals to learn how to"
"17395260","17395540"," invest."
"17396880","17399020"," I don't, I haven't thought about it completely. "
"17399900","17401460"," I feel like donate the house for some."
"17401640","17402300"," It'd be super cool."
"17402720","17403400"," It's a thought process. "
"17406810","17408450"," The basement of the bears feel at home."
"17411390","17417420"," I mean, it'd be cool."
"17418240","17421420"," Do you like, uh, flipping houses in Detroit, it's like one of the best. "
"17422940","17424880"," So, there's a reason why you flip houses here."
"17425040","17426340"," I'm going to tell you why right now, okay?"
"17427180","17429820"," Because, you know, you go, you go flipping houses in nice towns."
"17430700","17436360"," Like, I had no bunch of guys that do this, they do it in like, um, Cleveland and Minnesota, Dayton,"
"17436580","17439020"," Ohio, a bunch of different, uh, up and coming places, right?"
"17440660","17447220"," And, uh, the do is, uh, well, I stay, I say, I don't, I'm not friends. "
"17447420","17451260"," I do the slum lords or the flippers and that kind of stuff, but I feel like really trying to"
"17451260","17455160"," make a difference in the community and make a change in the community, right?"
"17455320","17461280"," You hire local people, uh, always hire local people, and then you build the house, uh, the prop"
"17461280","17464320"," properly, not just some bullshit, uh, flip, right?"
"17465180","17466520"," And you can do really well with it."
"17466640","17473960"," The best part though is to, the key behind this is, uh, if you are, uh, you want to become"
"17473960","17478540"," a real estate investor, let's say you go to a place like that's, let's say you have like Phoenix is"
"17478540","17480180"," a really hot market right now, right?"
"17480780","17483740"," Their houses are selling in multiples over what they should be."
"17484080","17487420"," If the market ever dumps, you can get fucked in those markets, right?"
"17487420","17489160"," You're like buying a house for 300 grand. "
"17489500","17492460"," You're, you're pimping it out selling a five, six, seven hundred thousand dollars."
"17492820","17494020"," If the market ever dumps, right?"
"17494500","17496540"," You're sitting upside down in a mortgage on that house."
"17496820","17499660"," You're going to get burned and that happened in the last housing crisis. "
"17500260","17505300"," But if you buy a house for cash and you can turn into a rental, you don't know anybody, any"
"17505300","17505860"," money on it."
"17506320","17510160"," And if the market ever goes bad and then you can't flip it or you can't turn into an Airbnb"
"17510160","17512960"," or something, you can at least turn into a rental, right?"
"17513180","17516940"," You've got nobody coming after you, uh, for that money, uh, on that house."
"17517900","17524100"," There's a lot more danger, uh, and a lot more risk in, uh, housing markets that are way overvalued,"
"17524520","17527960"," uh, when, when housing markets turn around. "
"17528760","17530380"," And the cost of entry is cheap."
"17530620","17535060"," Like you're talking anywhere from like a thousand bucks to fifty thousand dollars and then those"
"17535060","17539220"," flips typically cost anywhere from thirty thousand to fifty thousand dollars."
"17539920","17543980"," Right now to try to get a house, you can get some houses for like fifteen to thirty thousand. "
"17544720","17548460"," If you're not at the auction, like fifteen, usually get a good deal for like fifteen to thirty"
"17548460","17548700"," grand."
"17549440","17552240"," Uh, then somewhere between thirty and fifty at max."
"17553120","17559380"," And you can turn it for 160, 170, right now, 180,000. "
"17560120","17561820"," And that goes up as well."
"17562580","17563320"," You can buy houses here."
"17563940","17564980"," They have a million dollar homes in Detroit. "
"17565340","17567360"," Detroit's a, uh, a really coming up place."
"17572450","17573490"," Heh, heh, heh."
"17573910","17574710"," Have Jim's kept living. "
"17575790","17576370"," Denver's nuts."
"17576570","17580310"," Yeah, I used to live in, I used to live in Colorado when it was a sleepy town."
"17581050","17583470"," It was dirty back in the early two thousands. "
"17591950","17596090"," Yeah, I don't like, uh, there's a whole different, there's different classes of flippers."
"17596450","17600190"," There's like, um, hey, there's all kinds."
"17600510","17603650"," There's like, there's foreign, there's foreign entities. "
"17604710","17609150"," There's people from outside of the US, uh, that'll fund it."
"17610650","17614130"," And then you'll get like, uh, you'll get a broker, not a broker, but you'll get a guy with a"
"17614130","17615650"," real estate license in, let's say, California."
"17616170","17620010"," He goes around all these places and he'll buy a bunch of different properties in depressed areas. "
"17620590","17625410"," Uh, and then he'll buy like shithole and then he does a shitty job renovating it."
"17626050","17627690"," Puts a renter in it and they don't fix anything."
"17628050","17628550"," It's really bad. "
"17628710","17630390"," These guys are real bad, not nice people."
"17631070","17633610"," Um, then sometimes you'll get people there."
"17634190","17637850"," First, second, third houses they buy, they just don't do a legit job. "
"17638390","17639490"," Uh, they just flip them."
"17639810","17644470"," I tend to own my houses now, uh, rent them out as Airbnb's."
"17645270","17647070"," And I usually take them down to stud. "
"17648450","17649530"," Uh, get rid of anything."
"17649890","17651490"," If there's any lead paint, get rid of all that shit."
"17652270","17653990"," Uh, all new pipes, all new electrical. "
"17655250","17656050"," Nothing updated."
"17656530","17657790"," Now that bullshit with updating."
"17659530","17660570"," There's all kinds of scams. "
"17660890","17667850"," Like the scams that I see in real estate flipping are, or is talking like, yeah, not 90%, but like"
"17667850","17669610"," 70% bad news."
"17670510","17673250"," I got to have a Facebook group, right?"
"17674030","17677570"," And you'll see all these guys, they'll have like a real estate, they'll like, you know, like get a"
"17677570","17679570"," real estate license, start flipping."
"17680050","17684370"," And they'll tell you things like, uh, they'll say, you know, make sure all your guys have licenses. "
"17685890","17688170"," But in reality, you get your own builder's license."
"17689330","17694250"," Uh, they'll tell you they won't tell you like, uh, you know, you get what you deserve, that kind of"
"17694250","17694510"," nonsense."
"17695490","17699510"," Uh, but then they don't want to pay a licensed guy to do the actual work. "
"17700850","17702590"," You know, they don't want to pay flippers, typically."
"17702710","17703730"," You don't want to, they want it."
"17703730","17706850"," They'll tell everybody, yeah, make sure you're hiring only licensed guys. "
"17707190","17709230"," And then in reality, they're not hiring licensed guys."
"17709450","17710010"," I can afford them."
"17710370","17713590"," You just can't afford to pay licensed guys to do work for them. "
"17714610","17716130"," They kind of learn that stuff to sell."
"17716430","17719490"," So it's reiterating the common goal is to prevent war in Europe."
"17719890","17720230"," Uh oh. "
"17721410","17723030"," The common goal is to prevent war in Europe."
"17724650","17725710"," Market needs a catalyst."
"17728280","17732980"," There's all kinds of nonsense in this stuff, but uh, it's weird, because you meet these guys, some"
"17732980","17737380"," of, you know, some of these guys tell you that they want, uh, licensed guys, and they can't afford"
"17737380","17737540"," them. "
"17737620","17741480"," Then you go check on their flip that they're doing and it's the disaster, the work they've done."
"17742180","17748880"," The best thing to do is always find, uh, like an older contractor that's licensed to oversee your"
"17748880","17749160"," work."
"17749720","17753340"," And then accumulate really great workers over time, pay them really well. "
"17754160","17761820"," Then you get, you get your own, uh, builder's license, again, inspection from the city or you get"
"17761820","17766920"," out of the, to the engineering department and you get, uh, requirements for whatever part of the"
"17766920","17770780"," town they're, they're asking you to take some places, want you to do different things, depending on"
"17770780","17772020"," where you buy these houses."
"17773920","17775500"," Then you get someone to oversee your work."
"17782700","17783920"," Yeah, renting is where it's at. "
"17786240","17787340"," Yeah, this is where I paid ads."
"17788860","17790860"," Yeah, Brooks, you're having a, you hit used to flip too."
"17794330","17795150"," Yeah, two times. "
"17796530","17798450"," Yeah, there's a lot of bad flippers out there."
"17798630","17800830"," There's a lot of, there's a lot of shady shit."
"17801830","17803750"," I've seen all kinds of stupid shady shit. "
"17804010","17808610"," I've seen like, uh, I've got friends that buy houses that don't live here."
"17810430","17814990"," And they'll have, they'll have to contract a real estate agent here in Michigan, or in Detroit or"
"17814990","17820350"," whatever, and they'll intentionally not show them certain houses because they're not getting enough"
"17820350","17821170"," money on the commission."
"17821810","17823030"," So they'll tell them there's nothing available. "
"17823910","17825670"," They'll tell them like, place the shit hole or whatever."
"17825870","17828310"," All kinds of, I see so much shit for that stuff."
"17828530","17830110"," It's, there's so much trash. "
"17832210","17833330"," I'm not from this background."
"17833350","17834730"," So I'm like, yeah, this isn't me."
"17834950","17837790"," I actually moved here because of my first deal. "
"17837790","17842550"," I bought a house site unseen and I was lied to by the real estate agent and the sellers."
"17843310","17846970"," And I flew in to take a look at it and they were trying to fuck me over."
"17847970","17851310"," The first property I was going to buy are already done already renovated. "
"17852030","17852830"," That was the first house."
"17853630","17861050"," And I flew in to check it out and I lost a 15 grand or something on the deal."
"17862690","17868970"," They could sign the, send the purchase of sale agreement, put, put us some money down on it. "
"17869790","17874330"," I flew out on a, I flew out on a lark and sure enough, I was getting taken for a"
"17874330","17874530"," ride."
"17875290","17876610"," So you kind of have to be here for it too."
"17877390","17879690"," That's my recommendation is you always be here. "
"17880430","17881110"," You know what you're getting."
"17882650","17886790"," See the turn here in the spy here indicates off the charts."
"17888430","17889930"," You're looking bullish. "
"17896330","17897830"," It's not looking bearish right here."
"17898830","17908190"," I dip my toes back in here again and see what happens."
"17914430","17916670"," I'm going to try to buy some more calls here in a moment. "
"17919750","17922870"," Look, it's looking more bullish than it's looking bearish."
"17923030","17931810"," There is, there is some ice up here at 450 91, some sneaky bears hiding in here."
"17931810","17933270"," Let's see them hiding up in here. "
"17939210","17940010"," See right here."
"17940670","17942390"," Do the supply of sellers hiding above?"
"17943190","17943830"," You're right here."
"17953350","17955370"," Yeah, I'm just going to buy whatever price I can get them out. "
"17957750","17960390"," I think I just got, I think I just got taken for a ride."
"17962930","17964150"," Okay, so what am I in at?"
"17964670","17965150"," That's my question."
"17971710","17975210"," Yeah, so I'm on some, I'm on some 450 threes. "
"17975990","17979470"," Once again, we'll see if we can ride this up."
"17980250","17984970"," We could sell off here, but we'll get some Netflix calls coming in, some spy calls coming in."
"17985490","17986650"," We'll see what happens here. "
"17987050","17988190"," I'm willing to risk some money here."
"17991210","17994010"," We want to take the risk that we trade up into the bell here."
"17994210","17996530"," It's 158, we'll know if we reverse. "
"17997010","17998370"," We have the Hero Indicator."
"17999150","18000610"," Let's look at that too, right?"
"18000770","18001830"," So we've got the Hero Indicator up."
"18002110","18006130"," It was down to like 5,000, 4,000, 5,000. "
"18006250","18008010"," It's now up to 24,000."
"18008490","18009910"," There are more buyers and sellers."
"18010750","18013450"," I don't know what else you need to be bullish here into the close. "
"18017950","18020410"," So I'm back in some, hey Jason, good to see you brother."
"18020650","18020930"," How you been?"
"18028130","18028730"," Yeah, dude."
"18029690","18032450"," There's a few things, like Airbnb, right?"
"18033230","18034530"," So a couple of things. "
"18035010","18041270"," So you don't, I don't know what shouldn't say this shit, but I hate rent to people."
"18042450","18045010"," I don't like renting to rich people or poor people."
"18045270","18045830"," I shouldn't say that. "
"18046190","18051290"," But I like to rent to people that have a license for something, like a mechanic that has to keep"
"18051290","18054350"," a license or a nurse that has to maintain a license."
"18054990","18056690"," I like working class people."
"18056850","18060810"," They're my best tenants, working class people that have to keep a license of some kind. "
"18061030","18061870"," Like they have to go to work."
"18062390","18063070"," They have no choice."
"18063650","18064770"," They want to do this work. "
"18065130","18066490"," They've put time and effort into it."
"18067230","18069950"," I don't like rich people either though, rich people, scammers."
"18071030","18073310"," Like people with money won't pay their rent. "
"18075610","18077430"," I used to like Section 8 a lot."
"18079870","18084630"," But then the best I've had is Airbnb because you're not holding a renter."
"18085210","18087170"," They have different rules for Airbnb. "
"18087550","18091690"," You can kick people out, which is always nice to kick people out, right?"
"18091950","18093110"," Not be holding to anybody."
"18093490","18097710"," But that has its own problems because you have to either take care of a lot of stuff or you"
"18097710","18098970"," have to hire people to take care of stuff."
"18099490","18102050"," I mean, the taxes and the fees, they can be expensive. "
"18102850","18107190"," And then a friend that does some let's go pump it by."
"18107790","18108410"," Pamp it."
"18109050","18110030"," Pamp us into the clothes. "
"18111830","18112570"," So just heads up."
"18112710","18113850"," I am in calls right now."
"18114690","18115930"," So we'll see if I get burned. "
"18116650","18118870"," We'll see if we can trade this up."
"18120130","18122590"," 27,000 on the heroin indicator right now."
"18123770","18127270"," Should encounter some kind of volatility around $45.91 or so. "
"18127930","18128710"," And we'll see."
"18129170","18131670"," Now we've got a lot of bears on board right now."
"18131670","18136190"," So if we have some capitulation by the bears, we'll move up swiftly. "
"18141500","18143340"," Yeah, it's bizarre like working class people."
"18145000","18148040"," It's not that I hate poor people at all."
"18148340","18149040"," I've been there. "
"18149340","18151180"," So it's not that I hate poor people."
"18151340","18152720"," It's that poor people struggle to pay rent."
"18153120","18154280"," You know, it's not their fucking fault. "
"18154460","18156400"," I can't blame a poor person for not being able to pay rent."
"18156960","18158660"," I can't blame a person that works."
"18159620","18163560"," Makes 50 grand a year and has kids or a wife or a husband or something. "
"18164360","18168340"," You know, or just divorced, you know, with all kinds of problems that come along with it."
"18168700","18172060"," It's, you know, it's hard."
"18172280","18173180"," It's hard to be poor. "
"18173580","18174300"," It's not fucking easy."
"18176380","18178520"," But do the rich people the worst?"
"18179180","18181520"," They're the biggest non-pairs of rent out there."
"18181580","18185100"," If there was like a class of people that don't pay the rent, if they're paying rent, it's rich"
"18185100","18186680"," people in my experience. "
"18188060","18189420"," Your experience might differ."
"18190840","18193840"," But someone that has like work hard, they have a reason to go to work."
"18194080","18194660"," They've got kids. "
"18195040","18201540"," They've got a, they're the only provider, married couple, anything like that where they have to"
"18201540","18201700"," work."
"18201880","18202800"," They have to pay off a car."
"18202940","18206740"," They have to pay off kids and all that kind of nonsense. "
"18206880","18209440"," They typically do a good job of getting their rent paid."
"18211360","18212880"," Those are just real experiences."
"18213180","18216760"," Not shouldn't say that stuff because you can't discriminate against people. "
"18218780","18219860"," If they have a preference."
"18228430","18228830"," Yeah."
"18230390","18232250"," Yeah, so a VIX is being sneaky in the background. "
"18232550","18233710"," I wasn't paying attention to the VIX."
"18236470","18238450"," Yeah, it is being sneaky in the background, isn't it?"
"18243110","18244350"," Good eyes and that VIX."
"18249210","18255630"," If you had like a, if you had like a, maybe just bought like a big house and just rented"
"18255630","18258030"," out rooms for Airbnb, that's profitable. "
"18258810","18260950"," Oh yeah, VIX is peeking its head up, isn't it?"
"18262430","18263990"," VIX is sneaking in the background."
"18266390","18270510"," Got more calls coming in by February 9th, 452C."
"18271370","18271930"," Netflix. "
"18272350","18272650"," Are they called?"
"18272830","18273150"," Is that already?"
"18273550","18274370"," I might already have."
"18275270","18279030"," Netflix, February 11th, 405C for $250,000."
"18279930","18281350"," Lyft just came in. "
"18282190","18285090"," February 11th, 45C, $87,000."
"18287170","18288950"," Those came in at 2 o'clock."
"18289110","18291490"," It's 203, which a few minutes ago. "
"18295610","18299370"," So we'll see here if we, we'll see here if we break above."
"18300090","18300930"," We're going to be looking."
"18301190","18302410"," There were some sellers up here. "
"18303290","18307690"," Keep our eyes on these sneaky sellers."
"18307950","18308470"," They're hiding above."
"18308630","18313330"," They were hiding above right up here for 50, 88 or so. "
"18314030","18316910"," We'll see if we break through and above."
"18317790","18321350"," If we can get some capitulation of the VIX or if we're going to get rejected here."
"18354230","18354910"," It's not easy. "
"18355190","18361360"," There's like, there's like, if you're going to buy, I want you guys to know if you're ever buy a"
"18361360","18366120"," house, a flip or a renovate or live in, live rent free, live mortgage free."
"18366860","18370820"," More calls coming in the spy, February 9th, 41C, $37,000."
"18371260","18372780"," I always recommend that you get involved in it. "
"18373220","18375560"," Get involved in the process and start to the finish."
"18376580","18377860"," Someone's always trying to fuck you out there."
"18378060","18383740"," It doesn't matter if it's a real estate agent or if it's a builder or it could be the city,"
"18383980","18388500"," the county, someone's always running, trying to get money out of you at every leg of the way. "
"18388980","18392880"," And if you know what it's like, if you guys have always been working in offices or whatever, it's"
"18392880","18395760"," super cool to take on a job."
"18396280","18400860"," If you have a contractor, especially like a single guy or a single woman that's doing their own"
"18400860","18403500"," thing, that's one to teach you along the way."
"18404820","18406260"," Yeah, spy calls moving up. "
"18408020","18410180"," Cranking, spy calls cranking right now."
"18411360","18416940"," Looking for some resistance at $4.50, $9.98. Probably going to cut them loose up here soon."
"18418440","18428760"," Those spy calls are going to have to $1.9, $1.10. Get"
"18428760","18429480"," involved in the process. "
"18431440","18432920"," It's good for you to get involved in the process."
"18434280","18435760"," It's good to not have to pay a mortgage."
"18438220","18440000"," Feels good when you don't pay a mortgage in a house. "
"18441660","18442460"," Nothing like it."
"18443780","18453830"," Spy calls up to $1.11 briefly, $1.10, $1.11. Yeah,"
"18453930","18454910"," $50K is poor here."
"18456250","18461750"," I lived with CLT is making a move. "
"18462730","18463390"," Fix is spoofing."
"18464170","18467750"," You know, Kobe, I lived in a really nice place."
"18467950","18469190"," They lived in Park City, right?"
"18469870","18471350"," And we were making six figures. "
"18471970","18475090"," We were making not high six figures, but decent six figure salary."
"18475830","18479890"," Salaries are making combined, probably like 180,000 a year."
"18480470","18484590"," We were only working six to nine months a year, but we were poor. "
"18485130","18487190"," We had one child, and we were poor."
"18488270","18489090"," Paycheck to paycheck."
"18490310","18491890"," So it was a really nice place. "
"18492110","18494730"," It was like living in San Francisco or LA or something."
"18495130","18495850"," We have a brother-in-law."
"18496910","18500810"," They were living in San Francisco making high six figures, and they were poor. "
"18500810","18503790"," They had a rent to like a three-story or five-story walk-up."
"18504070","18506190"," They're paying like $6,500 a month in rent."
"18506750","18507350"," Some stupid. "
"18508050","18509450"," They had plastic furniture in their house."
"18510830","18512170"," This was pre-COVID stuff."
"18512710","18514610"," Like, right when we didn't even have the inflation we have now. "
"18517810","18521990"," Like, and so I lived out west, and I didn't like the rat race anymore."
"18522790","18531750"," I was living in the western U.S. where prices are very high, and I didn't want to live with"
"18531750","18532890"," everything on credit, right?"
"18533490","18536730"," Credit for your vehicles, credit for your home, credit everywhere, credit everywhere."
"18537450","18538290"," Maxed out everywhere. "
"18539710","18542890"," And I always see older friends of mine."
"18543270","18547750"," They can have an accident, or they get sick, and it's bankruptcy, right?"
"18548450","18549550"," You don't see those people."
"18549990","18552070"," We put them away in a closet. "
"18552810","18553930"," Don't talk about those people."
"18554830","18556270"," And they're losing everything."
"18556270","18566150"," And so I just wanted to have something for myself that, for my kids, for myself, so that I"
"18566150","18567190"," would have wealth. "
"18567790","18570570"," Real wealth is different than people think it is."
"18570810","18576550"," Now those calls are up to $1.14. Real wealth is different than what people think it really is."
"18577610","18578890"," You don't lose real wealth. "
"18579010","18579850"," It stays in your family."
"18580810","18584510"," It never goes away unless you're like the last person alive, unless you give it to somebody or"
"18584510","18584670"," whatever."
"18584670","18586670"," Unless you max it out for credit. "
"18587410","18591010"," Real wealth, real wealthy people, they own stuff outright."
"18592790","18596890"," Like that old Nantucket red wealth, not that new money wealth."
"18598830","18601790"," And it's hard to buy things and own them outright that don't depreciate. "
"18602090","18602790"," It is not easy."
"18603770","18608330"," It's so hard telling you, like when you're in the grind all day long."
"18609530","18611550"," But then when you flip to like, I'm going to buy something to own. "
"18612510","18613190"," This is not easy."
"18615510","18618310"," It is a challenge all day long."
"18627810","18636850"," Yeah, definitely Jason. "
"18641350","18647510"," Oh no, so I'm from Park City, so you can get a shithole for like six, seven hundred thousand"
"18647510","18647990"," dollars."
"18648510","18650590"," Most houses at Park City are millions."
"18651950","18653690"," Millions and millions of dollars. "
"18657750","18659270"," My video feed is frozen."
"18659690","18660710"," I think I'll look at it here."
"18662890","18664330"," No, it's not frozen on my end. "

"19152250","19153310"," Definitely to be expected."
"19168250","19173470"," Jason's saying that the 450-30 area is around 50% mark between January high and low seems"
"19173470","19173970"," important."
"19176730","19179790"," And he says he's originally from a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. "
"19180570","19183030"," At this point, the market only bad news is going to save the market."

"19230090","19230450"," Hold on."
"19231070","19233670"," Jason, did you check out spot camera report from this morning?"
"19235070","19244820"," They were saying that, uh, they were saying that, um, we"
"19244820","19250980"," shouldn't trade higher than 450 today unless we get call expansion in the market. "
"19250980","19253100"," We've had some call expansion in the market."
"19255400","19258520"," Also in the spot camera note this morning just heads up to everybody out there."
"19258520","19267380"," If we don't get call expansion in the market, we will then trade down back down to that lower"
"19267380","19268320"," trading range. "
"19270220","19271440"," Like a magnet."
"19272660","19281960"," We will trade back down to currently it looks like we'd trade back down to 442 or so unless we"
"19281960","19283440"," get further call expansion."
"19283440","19290180"," But it does look like today we got further call expansion in the form of IWM. "
"19300120","19300800"," What's her?"
"19302280","19303320"," What's her accent?"
"19303660","19304320"," I don't know her accent."
"19309320","19310160"," Is that New Zealand?"
"19327150","19331090"," All of a sudden like a Tesla, a Tesla bull just runs on stage with a cape on."
"19332250","19332970"," Streaks naked. "

"19382130","19383030"," I sold my calls."
"19383630","19384070"," I thought I did. "
"19385810","19387350"," Oh, I was still lucky."
"19391690","19399170"," Yeah, so Spock everyone's saying if we don't get call expansion above 450, we'll trade to 450 then"
"19399170","19400970"," trade back down to the lower trading zone."
"19404860","19405800"," Is she Kiwi?"
"19413700","19415860"," I missed him when you guys are going back up. "
"19424830","19426410"," I didn't miss what you said Jason."
"19433510","19436250"," I didn't catch Bob, Bob Caddles said."
"19438050","19444510"," Spock everyone said that if we don't get call expansion further out from 450, that we will trade or"

"19495120","19496220"," Which is no bueno."
"19501310","19502570"," All right, so cop back up."
"19503330","19504710"," Oh yeah, we are trading down again. "
"19506850","19508130"," Why are we trading down?"
"19508490","19509670"," Because we get a speech right now."
"19509770","19510110"," That's why."
"19512330","19514270"," The moment you're here with anybody talking. "

"19537790","19539770"," Yeah, anything over 2 percent is danger. "
"19540470","19540990"," Danger, danger."
"19542650","19543410"," 2 percent."
"19543530","19544970"," We're talking about 2 percent for months now. "
"19545610","19546670"," We don't want to see 2 percent."

"19739560","19740540"," It was the one-year anniversary."
"19741400","19742780"," And I like him or dislike him."

"19810510","19812210"," This is key support for SPY."
"19813270","19823030"," Okay, this is at 448.67. Bulls do not want this to break for a continued move higher into tomorrow. "

"20320180","20322680"," See if we can get some prints on Tesla or not."
"20323320","20324580"," See if there's a bid that comes in a Tesla. "
"20326720","20328760"," The inherent decay is back up to 8,000."
"20329940","20331260"," We'll see if this sticks or holds."
"20333820","20335900"," Let me get a trade into the bell or not. "
"20341750","20344830"," I can't believe Biden said Tesla if that really did happen."

"20358290","20363090"," Slide down that, slide down that channel on top of it. "
"20364030","20366490"," Maybe a slight dip below it at some point today."
"20370730","20372770"," Let's look at the VIX and see if it's ugly or not."
"20373250","20374970"," And the VIX is still elevated at this point. "
"20376810","20378170"," It's still looking kind of bullish."
"20378530","20383150"," If you're looking for another dip buy, a real dip buy on the VIX."
"20387790","20390610"," Probably up around 22.41 if it gets rejected. "
"20393530","20395190"," The indicator is still going up here."
"20395710","20399470"," Even with this light rejection, bears are going to try to lean into it."
"20401250","20402190"," Let's see what happens. "
"20405450","20409130"," I bought some calls here on this channel so let's see what happens."

"21451420","21453460"," And you can see the buyers down below at 448, 10. "
"21454200","21456140"," The seller's above 450, 87."
"21459100","21460940"," I got to change my marks so that I know."
"21463640","21464560"," How long to hold?"
"21465980","21467480"," Got no wind to hold them. "
"21468480","21469760"," No wind to hold them."
"21470320","21471500"," No wind to walk away."

"21508650","21510290"," It's wild, too, watching this, right?"
"21510290","21511330"," We had this low of 420."

"21516590","21518970"," Right in the middle, slightly high. "
"21520170","21523710"," Makes you wonder if they want to put it right up 440 for OPEX."
"21539590","21540850"," Makes you wonder if that's the plan."
"21542250","21543370"," I can open OPEX 440. "
"21546610","21549090"," Hair indicators up to 13,005."
"21550530","21551730"," The buy program's still on."
"21552210","21553790"," We'll find out more at the three o'clock hour. "
"21553790","21556070"," We've got like three more minutes left to find out what's really up."
"21562060","21563460"," It would kind of suck, right?"
"21563580","21565440"," They park it right at the club, right where we are."
"21565960","21567960"," Just like sideways, straight into the four o'clock. "
"21570820","21571800"," Time to place your bets."
"21572500","21575740"," Not really seeing any flow right now on the..."
"21579700","21580760"," Oh, I missed this one."
"21581900","21582960"," Some Facebook puts. "
"21590610","21591630"," We'll see what happens here."
"21592610","21597150"," Here's my question, is that we sell off every day, so I don't know if we sell off into the"
"21597150","21597650"," clothes today."
"21601460","21604060"," I don't like that we sell off in the clothes every single day. "
"21604080","21605860"," I always feel like that they switch it up."
"21606040","21606240"," We're back."
"21607440","21608180"," You know, trapping. "
"21614510","21615630"," I think it's a trap."
"21616510","21617210"," It's a bear trap."
"21617970","21619330"," I'm not positive on that, but I think it is. "
"21619910","21621310"," Hair indicators now at 10,000."

"21632540","21634580"," Where did I have my sell the rip was on?"
"21635380","21637820"," Where I sell it is that at 471, something. "
"21638580","21641280"," I think below 471, 92 or so."
"21642340","21643160"," Somewhere in there."
"21644520","21645240"," I'll sell it. "
"21648590","21650350"," Otherwise, I'm staying in and going nowhere."
"21651470","21654710"," I have a feeling that we go the other way, and this is just a trader feeling."
"21655650","21660770"," Every time we sell off this clothes every single day, and it's like, you know, it's that one time"
"21660770","21661390"," it doesn't work. "
"21664390","21667770"," You know, it's like works, it works, it works, it works, it works, it works, then all of a sudden"
"21667770","21668290"," it doesn't work."
"21669450","21674130"," And like you're scared the three times prior, you're scared to take those short, and the one time"
"21674130","21676510"," you take the short, you end up getting fucked."
"21684010","21684970"," Thanks for the heads up, Willie. "
"21685970","21686610"," 449-5."
"21690080","21690620"," Yeah, right?"
"21690820","21691300"," I got it."
"21691320","21692960"," It's like literally right in the middle of the range. "
"21694480","21697940"," Look at that choppy sea, diddling in the middle in."
"21701190","21703110"," And right now, market maker is taking my money."
"21703750","21706050"," We have moved, and market maker is taking my money right now. "
"21709250","21710370"," Just grinding them up."
"21713810","21715670"," Messray, 430 in a day, baby."
"21719070","21720670"," Does Facebook already down to 195?"
"21723270","21724190"," Down to 217. "
"21724450","21725450"," We can look at Facebook if you want."
"21726030","21726930"," You guys want to look at Facebook?"
"21727570","21731030"," I think yesterday it was, we'll get Tesla too real quick, if they got a bounce."
"21735430","21738010"," Yep, Biden finally saying okay to Tesla. "
"21739370","21740150"," Here's a fair point."
"21748540","21751020"," Same story on Tesla, not too much, right?"
"21751200","21757100"," But I dipped down to 900, 980, and then you were at Zapatite, traded higher."
"21758920","21759920"," Not much going on there. "
"21760500","21762120"," Let's look up, will you guys want me to look at?"
"21762200","21762560"," Yeah, Facebook."
"21762840","21763300"," Let's see Facebook."
"21765560","21771500"," I think that was my take on Facebook, is that the big by the dippers were down at 200. "
"21775730","21776930"," Maybe they've moved, sometimes they move."
"21777950","21778950"," So we'll see where they're at."
"21782050","21784290"," It's probably good to update every day on that stuff, right?"
"21784610","21785390"," From Facebook specifically. "
"21794020","21796700"," There you'll move, there's sales girls by removing the staring chips."
"21801190","21804730"," Yeah, I don't know if the buy program is on or sell programs on with the check, but usually they"
"21804730","21805230"," drop the news."
"21805390","21810570"," Sometimes trade the news usually gives it early, earlier than anybody else, but I'm not seeing,"
"21811890","21812750"," let's say I missed it. "
"21812950","21813890"," I was upstairs for a minute."
"21815210","21815710"," Wasn't here."
"21819450","21820710"," Oh, let me see if I see anything. "
"21822250","21825510"," PETA on reportedly, hardware chief to leave the company as part of the restructuring."
"21825850","21826130"," I love it."
"21826450","21826890"," Restructuring. "
"21827510","21827930"," Bullshit."
"21829610","21833530"," I don't see anything on the MOC buy or sell side yet."
"21834510","21837150"," See if you guys, you guys, any guys out there see anything on it?"
"21840390","21841110"," That would help. "
"21857750","21859190"," MNDT at 1837."
"21861830","21875450"," Yeah, I don't think I don't think that I, oh,"
"21875570","21877950"," I'm going to watch my shit here at 44812."
"21879230","21879790"," We'll see. "
"21880030","21881250"," We'll see if we get a dump or not."
"21882950","21884290"," There's a really trying here."
"21894690","21896410"," Not watching much flow right now. "
"21906910","21908030"," It does suck too."
"21908090","21909230"," Today is not an OPEC stay."
"21913950","21916910"," Usually on an OPEC stay, they move it to where they want it to be. "
"21921470","21925750"," White House just reiterating that they remain on track to announce their Supreme Court nominee by"
"21925750","21926590"," the end of this month."
"21933290","21938510"," Which, uh, yeah, I want to watch PETA on earnings today."
"21939270","21940670"," This isn't earnings I want to watch today. "
"21940830","21941170"," I want to watch."
"21943130","21948050"," I'm interested in PETA on N-phased, Polay, Lift, Spirit, possibly."
"21951190","21952790"," You guys interested in all those?"
"21957260","21958800"," Yeah, zero dates move much better. "
"21959760","21961600"," I got to wait for Facebook to load up."
"21962260","21962780"," Address."
"21963080","21964680"," It takes a moment for it to kick in, brother. "
"21969920","21970840"," It's a good Facebook."
"21979310","21983710"," Okay, let's do a little bit in-depth Facebook."
"21985730","21991850"," So earlier in the week, it looked like the support was at 200. "
"21994650","21997010"," Looks like it's setting on some major support right now."
"21998810","22000270"," We'll take a look at Facebook."
"22001970","22002950"," Take a minute for it to load up. "
"22004410","22005410"," Yeah, that's where they are."
"22005650","22015450"," But down here at 201.40. Right, there's minor support here at 211.19. Got lots of buyers"
"22015450","22016030"," down here."
"22016610","22018790"," Like any kind of accumulation between here and 200. "
"22019710","22023330"," You know, for a longer time frame, right now looks plausible."
"22026510","22027470"," We'll take a look below."
"22031760","22032200"," Yeah. "
"22032200","22041840"," Yeah, this does look like a, you know, 215.205. I mean, you kind of split in hairs here."
"22043940","22045420"," You can just get some leaps here."
"22045840","22047460"," This is where all the support is on. "
"22049660","22053560"," You got 190, 180, 150."
"22054420","22057160"," This is looking deep into the book on Facebook."
"22058220","22059660"," I think right here, right?"
"22059760","22061680"," You want to see where absolute bottom is, 150. "
"22061680","22071240"," I mean, just, you know, just what a few months ago, right?"
"22071340","22075460"," It was trading at some stupid 385 or something, right?"
"22078060","22084060"," So, I mean, not that I'm one that's like, eh, you should dollar cost average, but I mean dollar"
"22084060","22088800"," cost averaging Facebook for like a five year hold up between 150 and 215."
"22089520","22090440"," Not so bad."
"22096870","22101150"," I guess if you really like risk averse, you could just set two, set two lines. "
"22101370","22102250"," Let me set four lines, right?"
"22102450","22109490"," Set a line at 216, 210, 210, 190, 180, 150, right?"
"22109890","22117070"," Just make a plan and say I'm going to buy 5% here, 10% at 210, 5% at"
"22117070","22122430"," 200, and then 5% at 180, and then, you know, 50 or 60% at 150."
"22124550","22134440"," And I'm, you know, I'm anti Facebook right now, but"
"22134440","22139840"," at the same time, if you're looking for an entry into Facebook, it's not that hard of a ticker to"
"22140940","22145820"," to start to plan to buy a dip on, right?"
"22147630","22149930"," If it turns up, you can start to average in."
"22150250","22155570"," If it doesn't, you can start at like 5% buy right here, 5% buy at 210, 5%"
"22155570","22163790"," for 10% buy, let's say at 200, 10% buy at 180, and then a 50% buy and"
"22163790","22167030"," data 150 on it, on a really bad day in the market. "
"22168010","22173150"," If you're a Facebook bull, and you'd probably be doing quite well."
"22174650","22179330"," If it even got that low, and if it starts to break higher and starts to stabilize and trade"
"22179330","22182970"," sideways and consolidate, then trade higher and higher, and you didn't miss anything."
"22184750","22190310"," If all these like, I mean, if you were talking about Apple versus Facebook, I'd take the investment"
"22190310","22192790"," in Facebook over Apple just based on numbers. "
"22202660","22204380"," I'll watch them park it here right into the close."
"22204800","22206100"," I left my ass off, they did that."
"22209890","22211250"," It's 3.08 PM. "
"22212990","22219810"," I'd say there's some sell side activity, even though I haven't seen anything on the imbalance."
"22220350","22221890"," Anybody seen anything on the imbalance yet?"
"22225350","22228070"," Yeah, function in the universe is a long way off."
"22228230","22228630"," So I agree. "
"22228830","22230050"," I mean, all the other shit behind it."
"22235550","22239850"," Are you shitting me by and called Tesla, the nation's largest electric vehicle manufacturer?"
"22246110","22247590"," I'm missing some of you guys just talking."
"22253480","22260320"," Yeah, the, you guys know we could talk about this shit for days on Facebook, and there's such a"
"22260320","22261020"," clusterfuck. "
"22262380","22269740"," No, it's, yeah, my assumption is going to be that so right now we're at 47.8 on the buyers,"
"22270280","22272620"," buy side and 46.5 on those sell side."
"22273920","22276260"," So it's more buying than selling right now."
"22276460","22278720"," The here indicator is off the charts bullish. "
"22284980","22287020"," It's looking more even Steven than anything."
"22287600","22291860"," And I think someone above was talking about this earlier that we're right in balance right now."
"22292000","22292780"," We're at in balance. "
"22295160","22297160"," We are trading higher currently on the spy."
"22301670","22302370"," Here it is."
"22302570","22304110"," Someone in here is giving some good and good intel. "
"22304310","22305290"," There's a whole bunch of you guys in here."
"22305390","22306030"," Just as a heads up."
"22306150","22307910"," Any guys in here dropping knowledge and shit?"
"22308250","22309510"," Badasses, all of you. "
"22310270","22314030"," Like, I can't believe how pimp the information is that comes in here on the chat."
"22314370","22315590"," Like the chat is rad."
"22317670","22320990"," Oh, oh, oh, is that, is that, is that's why I'm trading higher?"
"22321970","22323310"," I'm trading higher on the spy. "
"22324630","22325330"," I hope it, baby."
"22325970","22327950"," I think I got the options was doing it."
"22328750","22330290"," Talking about some of that stuff. "

"24089880","24094580"," different times from now to March so while we're worried about the entire market they're still"
"24094580","24098960"," buying any companies that they've gotten knocked down right they're probably not buying Apple right"
"24098960","24103300"," now but they're gonna they are at some point if them if let's say Apple falls and they get to"
"24103300","24109320"," buy Apple they will so you should be identifying tickers at this point the market where you're like"
