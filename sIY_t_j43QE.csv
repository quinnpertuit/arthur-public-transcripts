"100770","102510"," There's some sellers at this level here. "
"103190","108330"," You can see that some of the sellers that were above it 480 swoop down into the fray."
"115950","117550"," I'm actually by the step right here."
"118190","120910"," I am going to buy the step right now. "

"218600","226700"," Okay, so I'm in at 73 cents on 1229 480c on the spy."
"231290","233330"," I like seeing what I'm seeing here."
"254880","256459"," Let's make a nice straddle too. "
"264020","265360"," Grab more cheap puts."
"266080","272140"," Hold the calls to 480 and then sell for profit and then just hang on and roll into more puts"
"272140","273660"," on 460."
"276220","277040"," Anybody watching?"
"279220","279980"," Oh, yeah. "
"280340","281060"," You guys are all here."

"310870","312090"," I grabbed that dip. "
"314270","320910"," Unless I see any dips down here and we're still up with by side over here."
"321310","322050"," Unless this changes."
"323550","325370"," I'm long the spy to 480. "
"338280","341260"," I wanted to quickly show you guys Netflix that Netflix feed."
"343320","344820"," That's 620 number."
"345300","346720"," This is where they're targeting this. "
"346940","348080"," This is a nice trade right here."
"349380","352780"," Someone took a took a 620 trade on Netflix."
"353740","359300"," It was for January 21st. "
"362210","368190"," Was a $1.8 million 616 call for a hedge, right?"
"368830","378280"," And then someone else placed a shorter dated Netflix call."
"378460","378820"," Would they trade?"
"381680","392190"," Yeah, someone else traded for $1.8 million January 21st 620c on Netflix."
"392650","393310"," I like that trade. "
"395640","396480"," I like that trade a lot."
"401970","403650"," And you guys are going to look at IWM."
"406800","407620"," Yeah, I like. "
"407620","408160"," Hey, King."
"408360","408680"," How are you?"
"409140","409520"," I like."
"410500","412340"," So I love IWM right now. "
"412700","419460"," You guys got to place your trades on IWM with spreads or with one to three month dated naked"
"419460","419920"," options."
"421180","422140"," The moment."
"422700","423380"," Hey, Matt. "
"423780","424740"," So the moment that."
"425860","429240"," The moment that that the hedge comes off IWM."
"429960","431020"," The moment that you start. "
"431020","431760"," Start."
"435360","437760"," Short covering on IWM."
"438400","443200"," The moment that you see you see the news talking about buying into small caps right now. "
"443540","444560"," It's everywhere, right?"
"445320","450500"," And the moment that you flip over that over that I think I showed you a level to be looking"
"450500","451080"," for, right?"
"451540","454100"," The moment you're over to 28 it's game over for the bears."
"455660","461720"," The moment that happens and I haven't seen any hedge flow that's put put oriented on IWM."
"462380","468140"," So as soon as this stuff rolls off unless we see that put flow in IWM as soon as this"
"468140","469920"," stuff rolls off, it's going to be a massive squeeze. "
"472760","477020"," You guys want to look at Amazon next you said when I'm breaking this thing again."
"477480","479440"," I'm going to keep loading tickers on here."
"479440","489600"," So I've"
"489600","491580"," got the best internet I can get. "
"491980","494560"," It's through Comcast, but I don't have the business internet."
"495060","499580"," So I have to call those guys and get make sure I've got the jack jacked up feed."
"501180","502200"," Crazy feed. "
"503020","505920"," I don't have fiber here."
"514559","516059"," Same situation on Amazon."
"517580","520580"," You're testing, you're testing shorts right now. "
"523680","525400"," You've got clear skies way above."
"525620","528100"," If you do have more sellers than buyers on Amazon."
"529840","531980"," That'd be a buyer at 3380. "
"532520","533940"," Let's take it to 34."
"538650","541550"," You can snap that as a support as a major support."
"542410","545470"," You can see that's where the buy side is down here. "
"548340","549880"," Buy sides at 3380."
"552400","554400"," You can see the south side's 3450."
"555220","556040"," You can sell it. "
"556140","558620"," There's there's active buying right now right at the money."
"563800","564920"," Check the Tesla feed."
"566280","567840"," See what's going on with weirdo Tesla. "
"575980","577000"," Oh, look at you."
"577820","579480"," Joe's Joe's printing, huh?"
"583840","584880"," Is Joe scared?"
"585040","585840"," He's not or he's not printing."
"586060","587040"," He bought that 1090. "
"596030","597210"," This is pretty neat on Tesla."
"597550","601650"," See in this, you can see we've got lopsided side on Tesla."
"602190","611350"," I'm assuming this is the dealers and market makers buying Tesla stock for those positive call"
"611350","612130"," hedges. "
"612710","617370"," So Joe, you've got the you've got the house on your side right now."
"617370","620270"," If you can hear me out there."
"626500","627860"," Ram processor power. "
"628140","629520"," I've got a pretty good processor in here."
"629920","632340"," It's not the best, but it's, it's pretty good."
"636690","646360"," Yeah, I've got a I've got an Intel core 15 on this one that's running Tesla reversal underway, huh?"
"647220","648120"," It doesn't look like that. "
"648360","648660"," Maybe."
"649460","650460"," I guess you could be right."
"650460","653140"," I do want you to know that. "
"653420","658820"," I don't know if you guys understand that when futures are bought, not futures."
"659260","659260"," Sorry."
"660780","667440"," When you guys understand that if I make really big bearish bets. "
"669200","673400"," That the market makers will sell their positions, right?"
"674340","677760"," And you guys know that when big bullish bets are made."
"678380","681140"," That the market makers will buy positions."
"681560","688240"," So if you're looking at the options flow right now on Tesla, it's really big call flow. "
"691290","694210"," Just be wary of that if you're a bear at the moment."
"698130","699710"," It's assumed that this is happening."
"701050","702130"," Good morning, Magnus. "
"702390","702690"," How are you?"
"702850","703510"," How are you?"
"704510","704930"," Desperado."
"706850","707530"," Start link."
"708110","710110"," Yeah, I just need to get the business class because I'm running. "
"710510","712110"," I'm running a ton off this stuff."
"712290","712530"," I'm running."
"713270","714790"," I've got other computers running right"
"714790","723450"," now. "
"723450","726910"," And I've got land set up on this computer."
"727150","731470"," So I think it's more and I had a critical failure inside of book map."
"731750","734390"," I don't think it came from the computer. "
"734530","736270"," I think it came from actual book map."
"736710","738290"," I've had book map crash in the past."
"740300","742140"," So I'm bullish on Tesla right here. "
"744980","749460"," Looks like the dealers are done buying future or buying shares of Tesla."
"749940","751740"," You're looking for more call flow to come in."
"754220","755660"," Roku's still getting a big bid. "
"755820","757120"," Spy's still getting a big bid."
"757920","764100"," Oh, one guy just bought $400,000 of 1231 1050 puts on Tesla."
"764920","767540"," Another guy just bought $1 million hedge. "
"768420","773560"," Against Tesla, one January 21st 1000 puts for $1 million."
"774480","775280"," I didn't see that."
"775760","777280"," I just did just see that. "
"778620","781840"," So they're going to try to pin Tesla into the into January."
"785430","787730"," A pinning action on on Tesla."
"787790","788650"," They're tempting to do. "
"788950","797780"," Let me see if they can bring up the hedging and the signature on that Tesla."
"798700","801660"," Put flow does not look like it's matching either."
"801940","802740"," Let me look here. "
"804440","806760"," Yeah, see that there's still bigger bets on."
"807160","811780"," You still have much larger bets on Tesla than you do on against Tesla right now."
"811780","817780"," So I'm going to post this to the Twitter feed so you guys can see it. "
"817980","821960"," Any of you guys that don't have this information can get it."
"829040","830660"," It's definitely not neutral."
"831060","835600"," It's four to one in favor of hedging calls on Tesla. "
"836160","837900"," We'll put it up so everybody has it."
"874370","876030"," Hedging both sides on Tesla."
"877610","881210"," And it's still the most bullish stock right now at this point. "
"882250","885470"," Roku has stupid flow $1.6 million."
"886530","890230"," Call flow on 33 calls or 33."
"891290","896870"," Alga or quant calls. "
"897250","900290"," You know, we're all cool is probably going to be the player for today."
"901450","902110"," I was to guess."
"903830","908250"," Roll cool beer runner and video beer runner in the short term. "
"912210","915330"," Roblox Disney is another good one."
"916140","917150"," Facebook's not a good one."
"917870","919310"," Spy's another good one. "
"922520","926780"," You've got big, big hedges against you guys are bears out there."
"926860","928080"," You want to chase some some money."
"930540","931360"," Ticker. "
"932100","936320"," Tango echo Charlie Lima T ECL."
"937160","944140"," It's has January 21 99.72 strike."
"944570","947380"," Puts for $3.7 million. "
"950620","953730"," Tmo 1228."
"954540","958310"," 550 P puts for $1.1 million."
"960370","963050"," The meme of the apes are going to like this. "
"964390","966950"," BB BY puts."
"968090","974830"," Three of them for January 7 and January 21 at $17 and $16."
"974830","983140"," Big money trying to knock BB BY down. "
"984480","990640"," Next one is F.I.N.X. Fox trot India November x ray."
"991260","996440"," F.I.N.X. for February 18 42 puts."
"997800","999580"," For almost a million bucks. "
"999580","1008100"," P.I.N.X. not going to be included in the group of beaten down tech."
"1008900","1010260"," I was hoping they were going to go up."
"1012410","1019490"," They've got July 15 July 15 puts for $700,000 at 35. "
"1020290","1021170"," That sucks."
"1022990","1025609"," P.I.N.X. just getting ragdolled."
"1026069","1029750"," I got to look to see if that's a hedge because it's going up or if that's. "
"1029910","1032030"," Oh, dude, my spy calls are going up."
"1033930","1034369"," Hells."
"1034490","1035510"," Yes, spy calls. "
"1036349","1036790"," Print."
"1045240","1047099"," So what other bear shit we got in here?"
"1047480","1049400"," I know I got to take care of you bears out there."
"1051140","1053360"," That's the bear hedging that's coming in right now. "
"1053700","1055500"," I want to see what's going on with pins."
"1055780","1058140"," I thought pins might, it might let pins up."
"1058820","1059300"," Nope. "
"1059640","1063100"," It's telling you to eat a bag of whatever on pins."
"1063620","1064280"," I really want to see."
"1064480","1071060"," I mean, I hate pins, but you know, $30, $37 bucks, $35 pin. "
"1071320","1072500"," They're going to pin pins again."
"1073580","1074980"," They're going to ragdoll it."
"1080630","1081790"," Dude, right on. "
"1081970","1084630"," That was a nice little spy ride right there."
"1085330","1087410"," Okay, so let's talk about something here."
"1087850","1089850"," Let's just ease up on the market for a moment. "
"1090050","1095600"," It's $10.30. I'm still looking for 480 on the spy."
"1096040","1098740"," It looks like everyone's looking for 480 on the spy right now."
"1099000","1100460"," You can see the buy side is winning. "
"1100920","1102300"," Even if we're making dips here."
"1103800","1108720"," You want to be buying dips right now unless the, unless the buy, unless the sell side comes into"
"1108720","1109300"," the market."
"1109780","1110840"," I'm going to have to take a break here. "
"1111020","1112380"," I'll leave the feed up for you."
"1112680","1116280"," I do want to talk to you guys about now come back and pop through."
"1116820","1117460"," You know what?"
"1117520","1120540"," I'll put AMD up for you guys so that. "
"1120540","1123160"," And I'll put, I'll leave Tesla up."
"1123400","1125340"," I'll put AMD up because it looks pretty good."
"1125400","1129280"," And I'll put Roku up because those two are looking like runners today. "
"1133870","1135330"," But what I want to talk to you guys about."
"1136230","1141950"," Yeah, it's weird when I, when I unsubscribe from a, from a feed, it's tripping up book map right"
"1141950","1142170"," now."
"1142190","1143150"," I don't know why that is. "
"1143610","1146670"," I think I'm having some issues with book map itself."
"1149090","1158990"," So I want to talk to you guys just the moment about, about where we are in the market."
"1160150","1162410"," So just have this on your mind right now. "
"1162490","1162610"," Okay."
"1165170","1168850"," We, we got pinned in the video this morning."
"1168850","1171510"," Talk to you about where we pinned at four, seven, eight, zero. "
"1172150","1176590"," And what that means is we're going to, we didn't bounce off it."
"1176590","1177290"," We didn't reject."
"1178230","1181550"," And now we're going to try to attempt to consume sellers. "
"1182110","1185850"," You can see right now that we're still above on, on buyers right now."
"1186270","1187630"," And that's why we're pinning."
"1187630","1191360"," And we're going to take a look above. "
"1193600","1196440"," So the expectation will be that we pin around here."
"1197140","1198700"," Once we get rid of all these sellers."
"1199500","1203800"," We should move higher to 480 and take a look higher to see if that's where we're going. "
"1204180","1209820"," If we are rejected at 480, 483, 4825, anything like that."
"1211900","1213580"," We will start to trade down."
"1213740","1219180"," I want you guys to be aware of that. "
"1220600","1226800"," If you start to see sellers overwhelm the buyers that you're going to be looking for your support"
"1226800","1229380"," levels that you have to dip by."
"1230560","1232380"," And so maybe aware of that as you move forward."
"1234000","1237000"," And that's the longer we stay pinned here. "
"1237420","1239880"," Let's say we stay pinned at this four, seven, eight, zero."
"1240480","1243320"," And we stay here for a long period of time."
"1243840","1246160"," One, two, three, four days, anything like that. "
"1246160","1249740"," Trading days, you will see us begin to trade down."
"1251300","1253420"," Let's be conscious of that as you move forward."
"1256000","1262560"," You guys also know that I've always expressed to you to be protecting yourselves at these moments. "
"1263360","1266600"," So you saw me, I had a small hedge two days ago."
"1267160","1268600"," I had a small hedge last night."
"1269300","1273520"," Even though it was in a long, I was in a bunch of longs yesterday when I was holding a"
"1273520","1273720"," hedge. "
"1274280","1279800"," Or let's say Friday into Monday and then Monday I held just the hedge into today."
"1280180","1285700"," It was cheap and it didn't cost me, it ended up costing me one penny to hold that hedge and"
"1285700","1287360"," I'll take that insurance all day long."
"1288260","1290040"," Now I'm long right now without a hedge. "
"1290700","1296520"," But if we stay around here, if I start to see, you can see that you were at 778 and"
"1296520","1302040"," 675 if we start to rotate there, I will throw a hedge on and still hold those calls here."
"1304110","1306390"," I just want you guys to be aware of that as you move forward."
"1306930","1310490"," You should be hedging yourself in this market at these levels all the time. "
"1310990","1315990"," And these are one of my rules and these, when I don't break a try or don't tend to break"
"1315990","1320530"," these rules and it tends to work out more times in my favor than not."
"1321150","1326250"," So if someone's just all along right now in this market, it's still dangerous."
"1327170","1332270"," We can still trade way way way way way down to 453. "
"1332590","1333210"," No problem."
"1333790","1335630"," Okay, even if you're bullish here."
"1336150","1341070"," I'm trying to pass this stuff on to you guys so that you guys understand these concepts. "
"1341970","1347690"," You got some of you guys out there lose money and you want to add some of these tools to"
"1347690","1349430"," your tool blocks for where we are in the market."
"1351050","1352370"," Guys, I'll get the get in this."
"1352510","1353750"," I'm not looking at the chat. "
"1356380","1357280"," Yeah, T-Crown."
"1357440","1360020"," If you've got a ticker that you're interested in, let me know."
"1360840","1362860"," I just saw your, your, your post. "
"1363700","1364300"," T-Crown."
"1364440","1367600"," If you want to, if you want to post some ask for me to look at a ticker, I can."
"1371590","1372850"," Spy call is getting murdered. "
"1373130","1375230"," Not why I bought, not, not sure why I bought."
"1375370","1375890"," I'm bearish here."
"1375950","1378510"," It looks sketchy too close to 480 where it can dump. "
"1379410","1380570"," I don't understand hedging."
"1381330","1385370"," There's a difference between hedging and put buying or call buying."
"1385370","1388930"," You'll see call hedging and you'll see put hedging. "
"1389350","1391750"," Normally you'll see them at tops and bottoms."
"1393010","1398730"," If we're at a top and you're seeing more call hedging than put hedging, that would infer that we're"
"1398730","1402630"," going up because the put or the call wall is being raised."
"1403350","1410270"," You'll have market makers and dealers that need to buy equities in case we go up. "
"1411250","1416270"," I have to do a video on this on a blackboard or something where I can make it really easy"
"1416270","1417350"," to understand."
"1420740","1425080"," So you want to be watching options flow while you're watching equity flow."
"1447460","1450640"," And Zatbi, please check out Facebook. "
"1451600","1455040"," Okay, so Facebook RCLKLAC."
"1468160","1470380"," So I'll start looking at some other feeds right now."
"1470440","1473800"," I'm going to go through Netflix, Tesla, and AMD once more for you. "
"1473800","1476980"," And then I'm going to delete these and then I'll go into these other these other shout outs."
"1478440","1480420"," I use my for options flow."
"1480540","1481200"," I've tried them all. "
"1481640","1484760"," My favorite is flow algo."
"1485200","1487760"," It takes some time to get used to, but it's the best."
"1487860","1489680"," It's the most directed flow that I've seen. "
"1504920","1507080"," Okay, let me kill some of these feeds."
"1511760","1513600"," Yep, Netflix price target 620."
"1514340","1515100"," I like that trade. "
"1517720","1518940"," You saw the flow come in."
"1519360","1521420"," You saw the call hedging come in for it."
"1526380","1531100"," Still have more sellers than buyers on Tesla down here at the bottom right hand side. "
"1531440","1533500"," You're sitting on the supply zone at 1080."
"1534120","1535760"," You've got further supplied out at 1070."
"1538520","1540920"," Call these cheap Tesla bulls down here. "
"1541440","1546300"," And what is nice to see above is that you've got some clear skies now to 1120."
"1546780","1550220"," Before you had lots of resistance at 1100."
"1550340","1554140"," So you can see sellers are being worn out here. "
"1554140","1557260"," So you've now got clear skies to 1120 on Tesla."
"1557740","1559880"," That's actually firming up to become much more bullish."
"1560540","1561820"," I like Tesla right now. "
"1563880","1566200"," And then we'll look at AMD next."
"1571880","1576920"," We'll be looking for AMD to we have where it looks like we're getting some more some more profit"
"1576920","1578740"," takers on AMD."
"1587850","1590090"," Yeah, Rinkle Dinkle book map is it, man. "
"1590490","1595450"," If you start to tie together one one note to make before we put these stickers up."
"1596250","1597830"," See, we're starting with."
"1598810","1601270"," I'm starting with volume and market profile. "
"1602990","1607650"," Then I'm moving on to gamma levels volatility levels."
"1610960","1614620"," Then I'm charting traditional charting right scene."
"1614760","1618340"," If all three of those are matching up, then I look at the market sentiment. "
"1618920","1623380"," I look at the market sentiment and I'm looking at retail sentiment."
"1625540","1630820"," I'm looking at a news that's coming out that the economic news, things we know that are coming."
"1632060","1637560"," And then the final piece of the puzzle is, of course, when the day comes to trade it, you're"
"1637560","1645020"," looking to see if the money shows up in the equity market on book map and tied in with an"
"1645020","1647220"," option flow software. "
"1647220","1649800"," And the hero indicator helps with that as well."
"1650480","1655660"," But the order flow, the excuse me, the flow, I'll go usually proves tying all that stuff together"
"1655660","1659980"," with flow, I'll go on book map, even if it hasn't printing right now at this exact moment."
"1660540","1663360"," It's working towards printing in time. "
"1664580","1669840"," And the only thing I'm looking for for that trade to fail would be to see the buyers disappear."
"1669840","1676620"," Some kind of news event, and you can use trade the news, you can use news squawk pay for any"
"1676620","1677260"," of those services."
"1678080","1679680"," AMD is like a banging right here. "
"1680200","1681720"," This is beautiful to see right here."
"1683820","1685680"," AMD is a great, great ticker."
"1686560","1695420"," And so I'm going to go back and see here what you guys calling up. "
"1696760","1698360"," Guys are caught pens."
"1698660","1700060"," I already did pens for you."
"1700500","1705020"," Kat, please check out Facebook KLC K L A C."
"1706080","1708040"," We'll do a Facebook next. "
"1714000","1720750"," And then we'll do a Facebook subscribe."
"1745210","1746190"," Take a look at Facebook."
"1754840","1762040"," You can snap lines in your charting right 345 347 decent support at 348. "
"1762800","1765840"," You've got sellers above at 353 355."
"1770310","1774250"," You actually see it firming up above here 355 360."
"1775250","1778270"," And then clear skies to 375 on Facebook. "
"1779470","1784470"," You've got more still more sellers than you do have buyers on on Facebook."
"1785730","1788730"," Next one KLC RCL."
"1789350","1790510"," Look at RCL next. "
"1792330","1794310"," You guys watching this feed real quick."
"1797290","1810270"," You can also see the buyers down here at 345 340 330 335 325 RCL."
"1832250","1836290"," What are you guys talking about out there that your premium is getting murdered?"
"1837210","1838790"," You guys need diamond hands. "
"1839390","1841330"," I don't know what you guys are talking about."
"1843500","1844780"," Premium is getting murdered."
"1857500","1858200"," Guys are crazy. "
"1859300","1860600"," Guys are animals."
"1863220","1865040"," Guys are hilarious."
"1869240","1869700"," Premium. "
"1870320","1874320"," I've seen the premium on my calls get straight wrecked."
"1875940","1876720"," Well, I don't know."
"1876880","1883600"," I bought my calls here at 73 cents on spy and I'm in the green. "
"1888460","1889480"," Ooh, this is nice."
"1890980","1891960"," Who's in RCL?"
"1893340","1895400"," Whoever's in RCL is a smart guy."
"1896000","1896820"," That's a nice trade. "
"1897640","1899520"," RCL you've got clear skies to 100."
"1900660","1901380"," Good job."
"1902780","1905380"," You've got more buyers than sellers in RCL. "
"1905860","1907000"," That's a nice trade by the way."
"1907600","1908700"," Whoever took that trade congratulations."
"1912770","1914070"," That's an outstanding trade. "
"1917160","1918000"," It's a really nice trade."
"1919100","1921340"," So your price target in RCL is 100."
"1923680","1925220"," You've got more buyers than sellers. "
"1925600","1926840"," That's the real true feed."
"1935880","1937260"," You guys see that RCL?"
"1937960","1940040"," What's the next ticker that was called out?"
"1940880","1942220"," K-L-A-C."
"1943600","1944860"," K-L-A-C. "
"1945020","1946000"," RCL is a nice trade."
"1946220","1946460"," Good job."
"1946600","1947300"," Whoever's in that trade. "
"1952970","1954190"," K-L-C-A."
"1954630","1955650"," K-L-A-C."
"1959800","1965620"," You guys aren't asking me to do tickers that are like, like penny stocks or anything, are you?"
"1969260","1969780"," Nope. "
"1973890","1975940"," Another nice trade like K-L-A-C."
"1976700","1978060"," Good job on this one."
"1981390","1982910"," It's kind of hilarious looking at this. "
"1983130","1984730"," You've got no buyers and no sellers."
"1986090","1987810"," It's like a Mexican standoff."
"1994390","2000250"," Your price target on K-L-A-C is 450. "
"2001390","2003270"," You have more buyers than sellers."
"2003630","2007830"," You're up almost 25% more buyers than sellers."
"2008370","2009530"," That's another great ticker. "
"2009530","2010830"," Good job on that one."
"2013620","2019240"," It does look like the buyers are a little standoffish, or they're just grinding all these sellers"
"2019240","2019840"," right here."
"2020940","2022860"," Your price target is definitely 450. "
"2025240","2026460"," That's a nice trade too."
"2027000","2029720"," You guys have caught out some banging tickers this morning."
"2038490","2039470"," What do we got here?"
"2039710","2040130"," Elsid. "
"2040950","2042590"," Yeah, you guys need some diamond hands."
"2046110","2051510"," So when you guys are panicking out there, looking at candlestick charts, and I'm not panicking here"
"2051510","2054730"," watching the book map, it's a whole other level."
"2055449","2057429"," It's not a completely different level, okay?"
"2057969","2060989"," So I've got no concerns here so far on the spy. "
"2064239","2065520"," I'll look at Elsid for you."
"2070290","2071449"," We're just grinding here."
"2071630","2076870"," If you guys are going to get bearish out there, you really do need to, you should get a piece"
"2076870","2081170"," of paper and write down the things that I tell you about looking to be bearish. "
"2081469","2086330"," What signs are you looking for at support and resistance levels to be bearish?"
"2086650","2091130"," What signs are you looking for to be bullish on support and resistance levels?"
"2091690","2096670"," Maybe I'll just write them down myself, like a top 10 list of things that you're looking for."
"2097170","2099550"," They hold true for both bulls and bears."
"2100410","2102370"," You're looking for a reaction. "
"2102890","2105090"," If we're on a bottom, you're looking for a bounce."
"2105090","2107910"," You're looking for those big hammer candles."
"2108690","2117390"," If you bounce on support, or if you don't break straight through support, that's not a bearish"
"2117390","2118010"," sign. "
"2118650","2126330"," If you are heading up to, let's say you ricochet off the bottom, that's a bullish sign, right?"
"2126910","2128970"," It's that big hammer candle that bounce off."
"2130290","2137220"," If we hit support and we start grinding there, that's very bearish, right?"
"2137640","2138220"," Does that make sense?"
"2138800","2140300"," You're continuing the bearish play."
"2141060","2147120"," If we are heading north, let's say we're heading towards resistance and we ricochet off, that's"
"2147120","2147660"," bearish. "
"2148000","2155040"," If we slam into resistance and we don't move, that is a consolidation phase where we're going to"
"2155040","2161060"," absorb the sellers and attempt to look higher and above to see if we're going to take it higher."
"2162180","2165640"," Now, we're looking for call flow for that to continuation of that."
"2166460","2171320"," I haven't seen any bearish put hedging come into the market on the spy. "
"2171980","2174520"," There's nothing indicating that we're going down here."
"2174860","2180700"," Over time, it could become more dangerous, but right now this just looks to me like we're grinding"
"2180700","2182120"," through sellers."
"2182940","2186300"," Also, we have more buyers than sellers down here on the right-hand side. "
"2186720","2189200"," There's nothing here saying that we're bearish."
"2189200","2194620"," If I'm looking at a candlestick chart and it looks on the candlestick chart like it's bearish, how"
"2194620","2200080"," many times do I come on Twitter and post to you guys, hey, do you see that bear flag right"
"2200080","2200340"," there?"
"2200680","2201840"," That's actually a bull flag."
"2202380","2205700"," Sometimes I come on Twitter and say, hey, do you see that bull flag right there?"
"2206120","2207260"," Well, that's actually a bear flag. "
"2207380","2208040"," It's going to fail."
"2208700","2210680"," You know those things by having this feed."
"2211220","2216280"," You know that whatever flags are setting up with traditional charting are sometimes false. "
"2217160","2217720"," Does that make sense?"
"2218460","2221560"," So this is that last piece to that puzzle."
"2224760","2230740"," Now, if you're a bearish right now watching this feed, you just keep your eyes down here in this"
"2230740","2231700"," bottom right-hand side."
"2232020","2239400"," If you see a huge increase in bearish selling, even if it's lower than the bull side, or if you"
"2239400","2247800"," see a decrease on the buy side and just a steady sell side, these are indicators that I'll show you"
"2247800","2249260"," if we're actually going to reverse. "
"2259410","2260970"," Yeah, Joe, absolutely."
"2263750","2268850"," It'll stop you from stopping out on both sides, on the bear trade and on the bull trade."
"2269690","2275590"," If the trend is we're in positive gamma right now, believe it or not, I think all the signs point"
"2275590","2277470"," towards we're still bullish at this moment. "
"2278390","2284790"," And if you are getting bearish right in this bullish context, you should be long this market with"
"2284790","2285490"," just a hedge."
"2286850","2287950"," That's what you should be."
"2288290","2294910"," If we're at the bottom right now, right, you'd be bearish, but you'd have that call hedge in case"
"2294910","2299050"," we flip back up, right, to save yourself from being in a bad position. "
"2300150","2302690"," You know, all this stuff is in the inverse as well."
"2303350","2305770"," So you guys have to switch this back and forth."
"2305790","2312470"," And you guys have to be able to switch back and forth, bullish or bearish or stay out of the"
"2312470","2317750"," trade until it becomes bearish if you're just a bear or if you're bull, just a bull, right?"
"2319310","2320870"," That's the whole thing about knife catching. "
"2321450","2325150"," You know, if you're a bull and can only take the bull trade, you have to know where to catch"
"2325150","2327730"," knives and where not to catch knives."
"2328810","2330970"," So if you're a bull and you're like, I can't buy a hedge."
"2331250","2332530"," I don't feel right buying a hedge. "
"2332770","2334810"," I don't know how the mechanics of it."
"2334910","2336630"," This isn't the place for you to be long."
"2338410","2344350"," The place for you to be long, if you were only bull, was way down at $4.48, $4.50."
"2345250","2348210"," Because you had no risk heading up here once we reversed. "
"2352370","2353690"," I think that has gravity today."
"2354170","2354430"," Yeah."
"2354790","2358590"," We're putting here looking for the market for direction or doing two things. "
"2359270","2361330"," Right now you can see that we're consuming sellers."
"2361970","2365270"," That takes time in a low volume day like today."
"2365330","2367030"," It takes time to consume those sellers. "
"2367930","2370690"," We're also looking for the hedges to come out in the market."
"2371770","2372490"," You look."
"2374270","2377570"," You're also looking for those for the JPM caller. "
"2378670","2381610"," You know that the absolute gamma wall right now is at 480."
"2382370","2382810"," Right."
"2382970","2385370"," You know that the absolute gamma strike is 480. "
"2385810","2390330"," So you need to see more calls coming into the market at higher numbers."
"2390870","2392650"," 480, 490, 500."
"2393390","2396610"," You really want to be seeing those placed into January, February, March. "
"2397270","2399370"," It doesn't matter if we're actually going there."
"2399370","2403510"," You just need to see them there so that we can actually get to 480."
"2407370","2408770"," No, I don't. "
"2408850","2411010"," I'd have to look at the call structure in RCL."
"2411690","2413950"," I don't like to recommend trades to people."
"2413950","2416230"," I'll tell you what my trades are. "
"2419020","2424990"," If I was going to buy RCL, when's their earnings date?"
"2425550","2426610"," Anybody know their earnings date?"
"2429540","2431800"," Let's look RCL earnings date."
"2441550","2446040"," So expected earnings date."
"2449000","2451980"," Says that the report date is February 1st. "
"2455000","2455200"," So."
"2462370","2465850"," Oh boy, RCL has got all kinds of hedging up."
"2466170","2468230"," RCL could definitely squeeze. "
"2468690","2471490"," I got to check to see what the."
"2476810","2480930"," I mean, there are some 100 calls in RCL that the bid is like two cents on."
"2482860","2483640"," That's interesting. "
"2483640","2491860"," So you've got interest at 90 C for January 21st at 62 cents."
"2498070","2499990"," Yeah, you've got, you can go to 100 for sure."
"2500110","2501570"," Is any good news for RCL?"
"2502170","2503530"," You easily see 100. "
"2510990","2513910"," If RCL pull the rabbit out of their house, out of their ass."
"2517470","2523620"," I mean, even if you lost that play, seems like, seems like there's."
"2524840","2528620"," Seems like there's some Ivy built into March for RCL. "
"2529900","2532140"," But damn dude, there's some really cheap calls."
"2534240","2538220"," You have to go through the options chain and see where there's interest in RCL."
"2544910","2547330"," You see here decent sellers trying to push down. "
"2547570","2551570"," But when sellers fell, it's more fuel, the upside still pinning yet we're still paying."
"2551750","2553150"," Rob understands what's going on."
"2553530","2556110"," The biggest issue is I have a belief in stock price will get somewhere. "
"2556290","2557170"," However, my timing is off."
"2557830","2560150"," I think best pass the buy a strike where you think it'll pass."
"2561170","2562390"," I'm not here for your trades. "
"2564670","2567610"," If you're not planning how you read and trip it to the tools wherever your levels, et cetera, is"
"2567610","2567890"," valuable."
"2568430","2568890"," Yeah, Rob."
"2570450","2572910"," I think I think a lot of you guys need to see. "
"2573890","2576110"," Watch some of my previous videos."
"2576470","2580770"," I need to start organizing them so you can see how I even start this whole process."
"2581290","2585010"," Because I start this process way, way back, looking at a one-year chart. "
"2585930","2589370"," I literally, I literally start at just looking at a year chart."
"2589950","2595950"," looking at, if I had just taken like nine or ten trades in the bull side, ten or twelve trades"
"2595950","2599830"," in the bear side that I would have been a 100% trader for this past year."
"2600470","2606450"," And this works in previous years as well, that you start basically right there. "
"2607190","2613550"," And I should have organized these things like watch this one first, watch this one second, and how"
"2613550","2617510"," you build the narrative in your belief structure and where we're going."
"2617950","2625930"," You can literally look at a stock or let's say a spy chart over the course of five years, break"
"2625930","2630730"," it down to one year, break it down to a month, break it down to a week, then a day,"
"2631210","2634690"," write down to what you're trading for your hypothesis."
"2635990","2641130"," And then of course you're moving all the way through the volume profile, the market profile, you're"
"2641130","2644390"," working through traditional charting techniques, the news, all that kind of stuff. "
"2644930","2648810"," And then you're moving into the poor moment that you're ready to place a trade for that day."
"2649630","2654310"," And you should be as informed as you possibly can, because what are you doing ultimately, and this"
"2654310","2656910"," market is putting risk on, right?"
"2657230","2663230"," Ultimately, you're making a decision, I'm bearish, I'm bullish, I am theta gang, I think we're"
"2663230","2666770"," going sideways, I'm neutral, neutral gang."
"2667790","2671190"," So, you know, you're gonna win and lose some, some of them you win tons. "
"2671870","2675470"," You know, some of these trades we've won thousands of percent on."
"2675850","2683310"," Do I think that us going 478 to 480 is going to print 100% or 300% I don't,"
"2683430","2685590"," you know, that trades over at this point."
"2686010","2689990"," If you guys are looking for the 3000% trade, I can tell you what it is. "
"2690710","2697390"," It's that you buy penny puts right now for $0.6 for every"
"2697390","2703870"," expire, you buy burn them to the ground over the next week or two."
"2704430","2706050"," And I guarantee one of those sets will hit."
"2706650","2710870"," You'll end up at the most spending a dollar to $3 in that trade. "
"2711390","2713070"," And I'm sure there'll be weakness at some point."
"2713570","2717290"," It's not guaranteed, but there's probably a 70, 80% chance."
"2719790","2722610"," And if we do get that weakness, those should print nice and fat. "
"2724900","2726980"," Oh, Apple's ripping."
"2730540","2731720"," You guys are hilarious."
"2732640","2733540"," You guys are hilarious. "
"2734000","2734760"," I love the drama."
"2737970","2739050"," Let's look at Elsid."
"2745440","2747280"," Not too much going on in Elsid. "
"2747740","2748820"," More sellers than buyers."
"2749980","2752960"," This is what, if you're an Elsid trainer, here's what you guys need to know."
"2759130","2763710"," So, you've got this, this is what's called the smart money is down at 30 bucks. "
"2767170","2770650"," You've got just low resistance above at $40."
"2771110","2772030"," Not a whole ton of resistance."
"2778890","2780450"," Have a buy order at 30 bucks. "
"2781030","2783830"," And you've got a lot of people buying right now at 35."
"2787990","2789090"," Does it go up from here?"
"2789390","2790010"," I have no idea."
"2791830","2794050"," This one's more difficult to take a look at right now. "
"2794510","2796590"," I'd be looking for more buyers to step in here."
"2798510","2799410"," I'd call it flat."
"2807990","2810530"," I'll do IWM and then I'll do a Neo. "
"2817330","2825070"," You know, it makes me wonder right now if you know how you saw people losing money."
"2825450","2829530"," This is weird because you start to see us at these levels and you see if Bitcoin is going down"
"2829530","2839340"," right now, that could be more covering from hedging, forest hedging on the downside and"
"2839340","2843840"," possibly some short hedge funds that have money tied up in Bitcoin."
"2844360","2847180"," I know that would shock some of you out there to know that. "
"2857150","2857790"," Ooh, Neo."
"2858210","2858830"," Good job, Neo."
"2861260","2862240"," Neo's got lots of buyers. "
"2863800","2865440"," You guys want a price target on Neo?"
"2877370","2878930"," Got clear skies to 45."
"2881690","2891960"," Your intraday support levels are 28 bucks, 29 bucks, 29.54. You've"
"2891960","2897820"," got resistance at 30.19, heavy resistance at 30.97. But above you've got clear skies."
"2898540","2902500"," And you've got double the buyers then you have sellers today and Neo. "
"2903020","2907320"," Neo's chart looks a lot nicer than Elsid's do does and Lucid."
"2907680","2908620"," I'll give you that."
"2910020","2913080"," I like the Neo chart better than I like the Elsid chart today. "
"2914780","2920640"," You guys can always pause these videos and go back then reset then recycle your feed and you'll be"
"2920640","2921640"," live again with me."
"2926340","2927860"," I'll check on IWM."
"2931630","2932870"," I'll do IWM next. "
"2938770","2943470"," Yeah, the one thing you got to understand about IWM, you guys, you guys have to understand an IWM"
"2943470","2945030"," is heavily shorted right now."
"2945870","2946890"," Heavily shorted."
"2947250","2948310"," It is a dangerous play. "
"2948770","2954310"," I think even in the video this morning I told you that when I enter IWM this next round that"
"2954310","2957970"," I'm going to probably end up burning some calls to the ground doing it."
"2958610","2960610"," You have to be aware of that."
"2961070","2962790"," That it's a dangerous play. "
"2963490","2965130"," That it's being actively shorted."
"2965670","2967510"," That the calls are cheap right now."
"2968990","2972850"," So any calls that I do buy there are naked not naked calls or naked puts I guess. "
"2975430","2979650"," Any call let's say I buy some single calls on on small caps."
"2980510","2984490"," The only thing worth buying is going to be dirt cheap."
"2985630","2986630"," Nothing that's in the money. "
"2986770","2989290"," I wouldn't I wouldn't trade in the money call on IWM right now."
"2991570","3001030"," You have to wait to see if these if these shorts get flipped by hedges rolling off into the 31st."
"3004430","3005490"," Let's look at IWM. "
"3006050","3006910"," Yeah, this is the same thing."
"3007710","3009250"," Just huge grinding right here."
"3010030","3011730"," You guys see this in IWM right?"
"3012750","3015350"," This is these are good numbers for the bulls here. "
"3016150","3023670"," You've got support down here at $22.91. You've got the cell supply side over here at $2.24. Just"
"3023670","3024830"," a big grind in IWM."
"3031750","3032970"," You guys want the truth?"
"3033950","3037810"," I it's on my short list for 2022 to buy."
"3039270","3043850"," I don't want to say that but it's on my short list for 2022. "
"3047030","3048170"," ArcG, ArcF."
"3048950","3055050"," I got to see I'm looking for some weakness still in our K and all the arc funds I'm looking"
"3055050","3058370"," for still a little bit more a little bit more weakness for a buy."
"3058990","3060010"," I hope I don't miss that trade. "
"3062990","3067110"," I hope that that trade comes to me where I want to buy it."
"3076700","3079660"," Yeah, so let's look at the arc K trade right now real quick."
"3085980","3088140"," Let's look where the smart money is. "
"3088200","3089220"," Let's look where everybody is."
"3089280","3090780"," Let's look at a bigger scale here."
"3093190","3099030"," So we know we've got we've got a wall right now at $125.1.30 on our K."
"3100170","3101830"," The current price is at $96. "
"3102770","3105490"," The smart money is feeding this at $90."
"3109620","3111920"," See this where the smart money is down below here."
"3113600","3120300"," You can see that arc is still being pinned not pinned but so you've got you've got trapped buyers. "
"3120800","3121860"," You've got trapped funds."
"3122160","3123940"," You've got trapped long only funds."
"3124500","3129100"," You've got Kathy Woods believe it or not that's probably still selling out of her positions. "
"3130020","3134700"," I know you guys love Kathy Woods but she sells just like everybody else she takes profit."
"3135800","3138500"," It's probably big shorts on our K still right now."
"3138920","3141780"," You can see a set see a still see a steady a steady supply. "
"3142240","3148200"," They are being worn out at what this 100 level here and I do think that our K is going"
"3148200","3150400"," up in 2022."
"3151120","3154440"," I would like to own it somewhere down around 75 or 90 bucks."
"3156260","3164620"," I'd like to see the market and some kind of weakness either on January 3rd or after earning season. "
"3164980","3169220"," I'd like to see maybe the market dump down and then get some nice buys in our K."
"3169740","3171340"," But our K is on my shortlist for this year."
"3171780","3179080"," Our K.R.G. I did a whole spiel a whole talk on Kathy Woods and Dark."
"3182510","3185170"," You know you've got people out there that hate it hate Kathy Woods. "
"3185670","3188130"," They had no problem buying Kathy Woods when it was going up."
"3188470","3189610"," Nobody had a problem buying it."
"3190050","3195470"," And when people tell you stories that oh look Kathy Woods funds are failing this year or whatever"
"3195470","3198050"," that has more to do with the other side of the trade. "
"3198430","3199030"," They're all short."
"3199570","3201530"," Our K going to you guys don't believe that."
"3201710","3203450"," They sell out of their positions as well. "
"3203970","3207930"," These people that were long in our K.R.G. R.K.F. all these different funds."
"3208430","3208910"," Same with Square."
"3209410","3212050"," Same with any of these companies they're selling out of except for some of them. "
"3212350","3218330"," You'll see companies like Pins they're not participating in this in this trade right this this"
"3218330","3218970"," bullish trade."
"3219590","3226670"," You'll see that they are being actively shorted because that COVID trade is over."
"3228940","3233300"," But some of these funds and some of these tech stocks you're going to see them rip. "
"3233800","3237900"," The ones that are really beaten down that have potential for the future they're going to rip into"
"3237900","3238480"," 2022."
"3239500","3248230"," And I'm putting together some research for this weekend for a Sunday for Sunday."
"3248230","3253630"," I'm going to do a live stream with a forecast for 2022. "
"3254450","3260050"," And we'll track it over the year and see how I do against everybody else."
"3261350","3263610"," I think I think I got a shot at it."
"3266130","3268690"," It's not it's that egotistical to say that shit. "
"3269630","3271390"," But I don't know if it is or isn't."
"3277540","3277860"," Yep."
"3278020","3280020"," So we're still in it for 480 on the spy. "
"3287330","3287650"," Okay."
"3289110","3290950"," I am going to take a break here guys."
"3291110","3291790"," It's 11 14. "
"3292510","3293830"," I got out of an hour and a half ago."
"3296270","3298450"," I'll do PR and T real quick and then I'm done."
"3299730","3300610"," I got to take a break. "
"3301670","3303230"," And I got some calls sitting here."
"3303270","3305250"," I got a I haven't even looked at the calls."
"3305450","3306230"," Look at you guys. "
"3310450","3311870"," Let me check my calls real quick."
"3313990","3316170"," Are they getting grind ground to dust?"
"3316390","3317890"," Yeah, they're back down to 63 cents."
"3320450","3321330"," No worries. "
"3326590","3327250"," I don't know that spy."
"3327990","3329610"," What was the one that you wanted me to?"
"3335310","3337370"," Wanted me to look at PR and T."
"3342010","3342690"," Let's see."
"3343130","3344630"," Tesla down Amazon up. "
"3344870","3350520"," We take a look at that PR and T for you and T."
"3351520","3351520"," Subscribe."
"3352480","3354800"," Yeah, you guys just look up what a pin is."
"3355340","3359340"," Go to like invest Investopedia and they'll discuss what a pin is to you. "
"3361130","3362770"," What it refers over time."
"3368350","3369810"," You guys want me to look at print."
"3370790","3373070"," You guys are having me chase $30 stocks. "
"3376250","3377730"," You got more sellers than buyers."
"3379710","3384190"," You've got supply of you've got you've got bag holders above at 50 bucks."
"3385530","3387610"," You want to seek a pitulation from them. "
"3389110","3390350"," It's an intraday chart."
"3390910","3399510"," This book map doesn't really do well often with watching tickers like this with with a low volume."
"3400390","3407050"," But if this helps you, your price targets 50 bucks or you're hoping that the sellers come down to"
"3407050","3408930"," you at 34 bucks and you can absorb them. "
"3409450","3412730"," Right now, you don't have enough buyers to absorb sellers right now."
"3413430","3421630"," If the sellers came down to me, you at 34 bucks, the stock price would crash with the with the"
"3421630","3422810"," lopsided volume right now."
"3425650","3427250"," So I'll leave the spy up for you. "
"3428150","3430910"," I'm going to leave this up with the volume off or whatever."
"3431770","3438530"," And unless you see some kind of a change here, if you want to get bearish on spy today or"
"3438530","3444210"," the market as a whole, you are looking for a chip, you know, a flip here, right?"
"3444410","3447010"," Or you get a watch for that shift to the south side."
"3447530","3449610"," Otherwise, we're grinding higher. "
"3450290","3452690"," I hope this all helps you guys this morning."
"3455180","3457740"," Yeah, I'm not, I don't know enough about print."
"3458720","3465340"," I so what for me, I want you guys to know for me, I was in Caffee Woods until last"
"3465340","3466340"," end of last year. "
"3466780","3472620"," And I sold out of Caffee Woods because I know how these guys operate."
"3472760","3473660"," I know these banks operate."
"3474020","3478780"," I know that what they're telling everybody to go long in ArcG and ArcF and the last year. "
"3478780","3481120"," ArcG still had some juice left in it."
"3481420","3483400"," In reality, all they're doing is selling you bags."
"3483760","3486180"," They're doing that right now with a lot with a lot of small caps. "
"3486960","3489380"," And I'll go into that and that that we do this live stream."
"3489440","3495240"," I'm going to talk to you guys about where everyone is saying the trade is into this year."
"3495620","3497720"," And all those stocks have been pumped up. "
"3498040","3499360"," You guys look like Home Depot."
"3499960","3502440"," It was totally pumped up from September until now."
"3502760","3510500"," And they're telling you to buy to the trade into 2022 in that it'll continue for three years is in"
"3510500","3514500"," real goods, the inflation trade, the real money trade. "
"3515260","3516640"," And I'm not buying it right now."
"3516880","3519160"," It smells like bagholding to me for 2022."
"3520060","3527020"," I do not trust any of these hedge funds that come out on TV, CNBC, any of these rinky dink"
"3527020","3532840"," fucking boiler room, fuck heads telling you what their forecast is. "
"3532840","3533920"," You should go back."
"3534180","3539280"," Go back every year to like do a Google search and search December."
"3540540","3550180"," Or you'll do you'll do the number two, do like December 2021 and then search forecast or stock"
"3550180","3550820"," forecast. "
"3551320","3553700"," And you'll see a bunch of articles come up by hedge funds."
"3553920","3554800"," You'll see it for every year."
"3555060","3556640"," You do it for 2020, 2019. "
"3557720","3561460"," And all these hack jobs come out and they pay for some time on CNBC."
"3562300","3564020"," And they're telling you what you should be buying."
"3564380","3566460"," And then look what happens for the entire next year. "
"3566820","3570820"," They sell down that shit that they just sell it sell it to bag holders."
"3575620","3576100"," All right."
"3576180","3577820"," I'm done calling tickers at this point. "
"3579940","3589470"," Mario, I'm going to put up Tesla for you because I know you guys are wondering someone was saying"
"3589470","3590250"," Tesla was down."
"3593970","3595250"," I love my Tesla gang."
"3595570","3596430"," I love my Tesla gang. "
"3596570","3598170"," So I'll bring up Tesla for you."
"3619290","3620850"," Yeah, nothing's changed here in Tesla."
"3620850","3625130"," So this is crash and right or ignore and continue. "
"3627440","3630200"," My memory allocation settings are set too low."
"3631000","3631340"," Okay."
"3632960","3635180"," So I need to set my memory higher. "
"3635900","3638880"," Okay, so right now it's nothing's really changed on Tesla."
"3639260","3639920"," Same story."
"3640680","3643040"," Support 1080 1070. "
"3644060","3648880"," Your price target has moved up from 10 from 1100 and 10 to 1120."
"3649320","3649980"," Nothing's changed."
"3655830","3657690"," Yeah, you guys have a wonderful day. "
"3657790","3658910"," Me and you take it easy, my brother."
"3661800","3662240"," Wonder."
"3662460","3663180"," Listen to Joe. "
"3663380","3664600"," I wonder if we just trade down now."
"3667520","3667960"," Okay."
"3667960","3671140"," So you guys got what I'm telling you about Tesla right now. "
"3671440","3672460"," Same support levels."
"3672640","3673240"," Nothing's changed."
"3674100","3677920"," These are better support levels than anybody else is going to give you out there on the Internet's. "
"3678220","3681640"," You've got the real deep by the dip, I guess, at 1050."
"3682140","3684140"," But your price target is 1120."
"3684400","3686240"," You guys know we go through this every few days, right?"
"3686740","3689220"," And I'm telling you guys where the price target is. "
"3690120","3691240"," You end up getting there."
"3692920","3699320"," You guys should know that if you want to, let's say you guys are in a Tesla call right now"
"3699320","3699980"," and you're spooked."
"3700560","3701260"," You guys are panicking. "
"3702240","3707160"," Does anybody out there remember what I tell you to do when you want to hedge a Tesla call?"
"3709070","3711770"," I tell you guys to buy spy puts, right?"
"3712050","3712570"," Spy penny puts."
"3713570","3717490"," So you guys are making these fat trades, right?"
"3717950","3720130"," You don't even buy, you don't even buy in Tesla puts."
"3720390","3722270"," You want to be buying dirt cheap spy puts. "
"3724030","3726090"," So you hedge your long trade on Tesla."
"3728630","3731570"," You say, let's say you say to yourself, oh, what if Tesla fails here?"
"3732390","3732790"," Okay."
"3733210","3736730"," So if Tesla fails, then you know that spy is going to start to fail, right?"
"3736730","3738790"," So where are the supports on the spy?"
"3739470","3743170"," So if the supports on the spy are down at, let me take a look. "
"3745960","3749620"," You know, you've got support on the spy at 475, right?"
"3750420","3753840"," You know, you've got, let's say you were to check, let's see what you look below."
"3754620","3764800"," You got to look for previous low, which is 468, 461."
"3765280","3771460"," So you could buy some 460 puts, a day or two out for like six cents. "
"3772620","3776740"," You know, you just load up on some of those and that'll protect your trade in Tesla."
"3777380","3780020"," It costs you nothing for where Tesla is actually going to go."
"3780840","3782300"," You guys, I'll understand that. "
"3788430","3790790"," You guys, and I'm looking at spy right now."
"3790890","3792010"," It looks so bearish, doesn't it?"
"3793030","3795310"," It's looking so bearish on the spy right now."
"3795890","3797250"," Let's see if any flows coming through. "
"3802630","3805790"," I bet the bears are foaming at the mouth right now."
"3808830","3810030"," Yeah, look at this spy."
"3810710","3820490"," A spy call just came through January 7th, 485 for $437 NVIDIA January"
"3820490","3823370"," 21st, 345 call. "
"3824510","3825590"," It's a nice call."
"3825810","3826390"," I like that call."
"3826390","3831050"," Roku January 7th, 265 call. "
"3831670","3834710"," It's a great call to Apple calls up the butt."
"3835310","3841690"," Like we got Apple calls, if stacks of Apple calls, stack of stacks of Apple calls, stacks of spy"
"3841690","3842050"," calls."
"3842690","3845150"," What does that tell you about spy that it's going down right now?"
"3845410","3848430"," No, it's telling you it's going up. "
"3861450","3863070"," All right, let me take a look."
"3867090","3870110"," Everybody wants to see that spy dip right now."
"3870790","3872350"," Everyone's like, come on down spy. "
"3875790","3876610"," Come on down."
"3876730","3878190"," You bear should load up right now."
"3896210","3905510"," You guys have all your price targets, 47569, 47448, and you've got 47209 and"
"3905510","3929290"," 470.48. Now"
"3929290","3930490"," I'm about to buy here. "
"3930830","3931710"," I'm about to buy some calls."
"3932170","3942170"," I'm about to add to that position, add to the spy"
"3942170","3942630"," position."
"3955390","3956610"," 53 cents. "
"3965140","3967000"," If I can add 30 cents, I'd be happy."
"3971610","3973750"," If I can add 30 cents, I'll add another 300."
"3974050","3975070"," I'll add three racks. "
"3995040","3997660"," You guys can see that the sellers came down from 480."
"3998500","3999100"," I think they did."
"3999740","4000740"," They look above here. "
"4004120","4005100"," Nope, they're still up there."
"4007610","4008930"," They're still up there at 480."
"4012240","4013620"," Looks like some of them came down. "
"4013900","4014840"," This is turning yellow now."
"4017560","4020340"," And they're still being absorbed here."
"4022670","4024970"," You can see how this is turning yellow and red. "
"4025510","4027610"," See how deep red this is turning right here?"
"4028450","4031850"," These are some sellers that are coming down from that 480 mark."
"4040280","4045240"," And you're seeing the buy side start to slightly disappear over here on the spy."
"4046520","4048060"," You've got bears leaning in. "
"4050290","4052630"," You can see the bears here."
"4052850","4054470"," You see this movement right here."
"4054470","4058550"," You've got almost a million sellers, 981 on spy. "
"4059490","4062090"," And then they're creeping up on the on the bulls right now."
"4062250","4062670"," This is nice."
"4063790","4065050"," Give me a good dip buy. "
"4065470","4077530"," I want"
"4077530","4078530"," a good dip buy here."
"4110380","4111240"," I'm going to buy that."
"4116810","4126640"," So let me know right here from what you're"
"4126640","4127120"," looking at. "
"4127180","4132080"," Do you think that we dip here any farther or if we had higher at this point?"
"4132840","4135040"," Let me see what you guys are thinking right now."
"4135520","4137340"," So I just added more at 50 cents."
"4140180","4142180"," I just added more at 50 cents. "
"4142580","4146140"," If I'll do one more dip buy if I can get it down at 30 cents."
"4146880","4149760"," That'd be my preference, like 20 to 30 cents."
"4156649","4158750"," Yeah, I'll repeat the supports on spy. "
"4160649","4161630"," Thanks, Ty here."
"4162310","4163649"," Matter of fact, I'll get you even."
"4164290","4171109"," If you guys, if you guys look at my video from this morning, I show you the supports on spy"
"4171109","4171790"," in the video. "
"4172149","4176290"," You can just go through, pause it and snap lines on your own charting software."
"4182080","4186560"," So I bought at, I have to go back and look and see where I originally bought."
"4187700","4190100"," My first buy was at 73 cents. "
"4190720","4192420"," And then I just added at 50 cents."
"4192859","4195880"," Another rack or I just had three more racks of 50 cents."
"4196420","4200960"," And then I'm hopefully I can buy more at 30 cents at some point. "
"4201840","4208600"," Now, if once I get into that third round, if we break below 30 cents, I would sell and cut"
"4208600","4210420"," my cut that cut my long side loose."
"4228140","4229860"," And we're up, we're already up on those."
"4255440","4257900"," So I'm holding, what am I holding right now?"
"4258800","4263480"," I am holding December 29th 480C. "
"4267430","4270050"," My first buy in was at 73 cents."
"4270230","4272190"," My second buy was at 50 cents."
"4282030","4282490"," Yeah, it sucked. "
"4282930","4287590"," So this computer that I'm running this live stream on, I haven't switched, think or swim over to my"
"4287590","4288350"," other computer yet."
"4288890","4294770"," I need to switch it over so that I can check on the volume and market profile while I'm trading."
"4295250","4302730"," I still have some, some mood, some, I have to switch some software from computer to computer so I"
"4302730","4305050"," can run book map live stream on this computer specifically. "
"4310510","4313230"," Yeah, my hope would be that I could buy more at 30."
"4314230","4316070"," That would be the last dip buy for me."
"4323870","4329850"," I like the idea of one more day left on if I'm looking for options there, if I'm going to"
"4329850","4335910"," day trade or hold a trade overnight, I like to them to be roughly 20, 30 cents if they can"
"4335910","4337830"," be if we're dip buying. "
"4339490","4344140"," But if not, I'll take the ride up."
"4351230","4354430"," All right, I'm going to take a break."
"4355490","4357490"," I got to take, I got some stuff with my kids I got to do. "
"4358590","4364010"," If we come to a pivot, if we start to sell off at any point today, I'll come, I'm going"
"4364010","4365230"," to leave this live stream up."
"4365710","4373750"," What I'll do is I'll jump back on, I'll come back downstairs, I'll pop my, my microphone in and"
"4373750","4375150"," we'll make a trade."
"4375690","4378790"," Right now though, you guys just want to be paying, the only thing you guys need to be paying"
"4378790","4382310"," attention to right here is buyers and sellers. "
"4383210","4389290"," Okay, you want to know where the if you see supply leave, you're looking for this 480."
"4389770","4397450"," If these sellers up here swoop down, if you see, show you this better here, if you see these"
"4397450","4400970"," sellers swoop down, you'll actually see this line move down."
"4401570","4408070"," If you see here on this right hand side of the screen, if you see big red bands and this"
"4408070","4413490"," turns like a light blue or it turns black or anything like that, then you're going to see heavy"
"4413490","4414430"," sellers coming in. "
"4414570","4418530"," You're also watching the bubbles as sellers enter the market right here."
"4420330","4425430"," You guys keep your eyes on this, you guys go back into my daily brief, I set, I give you"
"4425430","4432370"," guys, I give you guys intraday support levels, I talk about them being intraday and then I give you"
"4432370","4437730"," the hard support levels in terms of volatility levels and gamma levels."
"4440890","4442110"," All right, I'll check back in. "
"4442330","4448550"," Thanks for everybody for tuning in this morning and I'll be checking in with you guys probably at"
"4448550","4453810"," the three o'clock hour somewhere in there, unless something changes today."
"4458800","4460700"," I got to take care of something with my kids."
"4461820","4462680"," Let me take a look at this. "
"4487460","4488940"," Okay, I'll talk to you guys later. "
