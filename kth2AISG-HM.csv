"kth2AISG-HM","621280","623280"," I think it was Main Street loans"
"kth2AISG-HM","623800","631320"," And it was it was absurd and absurd conversation Jerome Powell is actually looking out for the regular guy out there"
"kth2AISG-HM","631640","635400"," Because the Senate's like why aren't you giving loans to these people on Main Street?"
"kth2AISG-HM","635880","638200"," And he's like we should just give him free money like"
"kth2AISG-HM","638720","641040"," None of these people are gonna pay this money back to you"

"kth2AISG-HM","651400","655680"," Just give it to the guy on Main Street to if you know if you really want Main Street to survive"
"kth2AISG-HM","655680","658800"," And if you're a small business owner, you know, they don't want Main Street to survive"
"kth2AISG-HM","659640","662880"," At all they want they want corporations to survive"
"kth2AISG-HM","664160","669320"," So that was kind of humorous to to see how how that conversation went down"
"kth2AISG-HM","671040","673040"," You guys remember that I think that was during covid"
"kth2AISG-HM","674400","677720"," During some Senate hearings it was just bizarre to listen to"
"kth2AISG-HM","678600","682200"," And you know, of course then you've got other other Senate hearings where you have"
"kth2AISG-HM","683280","687000"," Some politicians or you know, all these politicians buy tech stonks"

"kth2AISG-HM","706920","708920"," So, you know, it's a lot of brow beating"
"kth2AISG-HM","710600","712600"," Amongst friends"
"kth2AISG-HM","712640","719240"," For an audience almost like their children not right. It's like it's like it's like my wife maybe say to me"
"kth2AISG-HM","719240","721240"," I'm going to admonish you in front of the kids and"

"kth2AISG-HM","773240","775240"," For most of the public"

"kth2AISG-HM","5916100","5919940"," so the fed has raised interest rates eight times over the last year in what"
"kth2AISG-HM","5919940","5923780"," has been the most extreme rate height cycle"
"kth2AISG-HM","5923780","5929220"," in 40 years the fed's goal is to slow inflation and your tool"
"kth2AISG-HM","5929220","5932660"," raising interest rates is designed to slow the economy"
"kth2AISG-HM","5932660","5936900"," and throw people out of work so far you haven't tipped the economy into"
"kth2AISG-HM","5936900","5938820"," recession but you haven't brought inflation"
"kth2AISG-HM","5938820","5944340"," uh-oh we know that reason for that is that other things are also keeping"
"kth2AISG-HM","5944340","5947940"," prices high things you can't fix with high interest rates"
"kth2AISG-HM","5947940","5951140"," things like price gouging and supply chain kinks"
"kth2AISG-HM","5951140","5955060"," and a war in Ukraine but you are determined to continue to raise"
"kth2AISG-HM","5955060","5958340"," interest rates so i wanted to take a look at where you're headed"
"kth2AISG-HM","5958340","5962820"," in december the fed released its projections on the state of the economy"
"kth2AISG-HM","5962820","5968420"," under your monetary policy plan according to the fed's own report"
"kth2AISG-HM","5968420","5972180"," if you'll continue raising interest rates as you plan"
"kth2AISG-HM","5972180","5974820"," unemployment will be give me to say i think quick break"
"kth2AISG-HM","5974820","5979300"," breakers late by the producer more than a full point higher"
"kth2AISG-HM","5979300","5983860"," than it is today chair pal if you hit your projections"
"kth2AISG-HM","5983860","5986900"," do you know how many people who are currently working"
"kth2AISG-HM","5986900","5991460"," going about their lives will lose their jobs"
"kth2AISG-HM","5991460","5995860"," i don't uh i don't have that number in front of me i will say it's not"
"kth2AISG-HM","5995860","5999940"," it's not an intended consequence it's well but it is and it's in your report"
"kth2AISG-HM","5999940","6002740"," and that would be about two million people"
"kth2AISG-HM","6002740","6005860"," who would lose their jobs people who are working right now making their"
"kth2AISG-HM","6005860","6009460"," mortgages so chair pal if you could speak directly"
"kth2AISG-HM","6009460","6014660"," to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today"
"kth2AISG-HM","6014660","6018820"," who you're planning to get fired over the next year"
"kth2AISG-HM","6018820","6022020"," what would you say to them how would you explain your view that they need to"
"kth2AISG-HM","6022020","6025940"," lose their jobs i would explain to people more broadly"
"kth2AISG-HM","6025940","6030340"," that that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of"
"kth2AISG-HM","6030340","6034420"," this country badly all of them not just two million of them but all of them"
"kth2AISG-HM","6034420","6038100"," are suffering under high inflation and we are taking"
"kth2AISG-HM","6038100","6041220"," the only measures we have to bring inflation down"
"kth2AISG-HM","6041220","6045300"," and putting two million people out of work is just part of the cost and they"
"kth2AISG-HM","6045300","6049380"," just have to bear it well they will will working people be better off"
"kth2AISG-HM","6049380","6054100"," if if we just walk away from our jobs and and inflation remains five six percent"
"kth2AISG-HM","6054100","6059300"," let me ask you about what happens if you do this since the end of world war two"
"kth2AISG-HM","6059300","6063460"," there have been 12 times in which the unemployment rate has increased"
"kth2AISG-HM","6063460","6066820"," world war two baby percentage point within one year"
"kth2AISG-HM","6066820","6072020"," exactly what you're aiming to do right now how many of those times did the"
"kth2AISG-HM","6072020","6077460"," move on the day avoid falling into a recession"
"kth2AISG-HM","6078420","6082500"," you know it's it's not as black and white is very very in the numbers"
"kth2AISG-HM","6082500","6085060"," it actually is pretty black Alan Blaine has written a book on this"
"kth2AISG-HM","6085220","6088980"," and there have been 12 times 14 minutes left for the bears get a new low"
"kth2AISG-HM","6088980","6092740"," increase in the unemployment rate in a year"
"kth2AISG-HM","6092740","6097300"," that's exactly what your Fed report has put out as the projection"
"kth2AISG-HM","6097300","6100900"," and the plan based on how you're going to keep raising these interest rates"
"kth2AISG-HM","6100900","6105780"," how many times did the economy fail to fall into a recession after doing that"
"kth2AISG-HM","6105780","6109460"," out of 12 times it's like one point like one person one point"
"kth2AISG-HM","6109460","6113540"," exactly right let me see if I measure that again then the question becomes"
"kth2AISG-HM","6113540","6116180"," we've got two million people out of work"
"kth2AISG-HM","6116180","6121140"," can you stop it yeah it's like point people um history"
"kth2AISG-HM","6121140","6125060"," six one point zero one percent on this low right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","6125060","6129380"," this four hundred point two one percent move down one point zero one percent"
"kth2AISG-HM","6129380","6133540"," once the economy starts shedding jobs it's kind of like a runaway train"
"kth2AISG-HM","6133540","6138820"," it is really hard to stop in fact in a little bit left for the bears to get a"
"kth2AISG-HM","6138820","6141780"," new low that the other one can't get a new low off this one"
"kth2AISG-HM","6142020","6145060"," so why you guys see this from the from the bear side"
"kth2AISG-HM","6145060","6148900"," unemployment when you trade this one minute here they have to get a new low"
"kth2AISG-HM","6148900","6152900"," if they don't get the new low it shows uh it shows weakness in the bear"
"kth2AISG-HM","6152900","6156180"," move lower so see the new there's no new low right"
"kth2AISG-HM","6156180","6158980"," here so the next 12 minutes if we don't see one"
"kth2AISG-HM","6158980","6163860"," down move over if you reach your goal and two million people get"
"kth2AISG-HM","6163860","6166740"," 12 minutes left for the bears be a new low if they can't get the new low this"
"kth2AISG-HM","6166740","6170580"," is it that is bottom like in 11 out of 12 times"
"kth2AISG-HM","6170580","6174580"," that unemployment has risen 12 minutes left for bears"
"kth2AISG-HM","6174580","6179220"," it keeps on rising and then we've got two and a half million people out of"
"kth2AISG-HM","6179220","6182340"," work we've got three million people who get laid off"
"kth2AISG-HM","6182340","6184660"," we've got three and a half million people who got"
"kth2AISG-HM","6184660","6188100"," that's passed as a fourth but five percent unemployment rate is still"
"kth2AISG-HM","6188100","6193060"," well better than most times historically which is the lowest in 54 years and"
"kth2AISG-HM","6193060","6196420"," we actually don't think that we need to see a sharp"
"kth2AISG-HM","6196420","6199540"," or enormous increase in unemployment to get inflation under control"
"kth2AISG-HM","6199540","6202580"," i'm looking at your projections do you call to"
"kth2AISG-HM","6202580","6205860"," laying off two million people this year not a sharp increase"
"kth2AISG-HM","6205860","6209220"," and i would say four and a half you guys realize this is an argument about"
"kth2AISG-HM","6209220","6213060"," modern monetary theory right under the surface you guys all get that up"
"kth2AISG-HM","6213060","6215380"," you guys all understand what they're doing right here four and a half percent"
"kth2AISG-HM","6215380","6220020"," unemployment talking about using rates to limit most of the time growth"
"kth2AISG-HM","6220020","6223700"," you know 75 years in other words you don't have a plan to stop a runaway"
"kth2AISG-HM","6223700","6226260"," train if fundamental change in policy"
"kth2AISG-HM","6226260","6231140"," gambling permanent fundamental change in policy and there's a pile of data"
"kth2AISG-HM","6231140","6235380"," showing the price gouging and supply chain we know that we we know there were"
"kth2AISG-HM","6235380","6238500"," too greedy to allow that you cling to the idea that there's"
"kth2AISG-HM","6238500","6241220"," only one this is looking like a bottoming here"
"kth2AISG-HM","6241220","6245860"," no new hot no no low right now four zero four zero zero zero point two two"
"kth2AISG-HM","6245860","6249700"," this looks like bottom at the moment it's getting close we got 11 minutes left"
"kth2AISG-HM","6249700","6252820"," for bears to get a new low they want to get a quick reverse to"
"kth2AISG-HM","6253460","6257860"," this last 10 minutes they want to get a new low down here if they can't get it"
"kth2AISG-HM","6257860","6261380"," uh it's gonna reverse and go hire mayor so i might as well ask it so so to give"
"kth2AISG-HM","6261380","6264260"," some context here my family comes from Appalachia"
"kth2AISG-HM","6264260","6267860"," uh particularly my grandparents grew up in southeast Kentucky"
"kth2AISG-HM","6267860","6271140"," now do i believe that we're going to have that monitor that or that or that uh"
"kth2AISG-HM","6271140","6275300"," change in policy i don't i don't think that we're i think we're too greedy now"
"kth2AISG-HM","6275300","6278900"," to study the the right i don't buy it for a minute i think someone will run against"
"kth2AISG-HM","6278900","6282420"," it and you'll see us go right back 20 i was reading a story this morning"
"kth2AISG-HM","6282420","6285860"," right so there's a lot before the whole in central Appalachia uh that"
"kth2AISG-HM","6285860","6290580"," i was reading a story this morning before the uh before we opened up this morning"
"kth2AISG-HM","6290580","6295780"," and uh some smart guy said you know what they have to do is"
"kth2AISG-HM","6295780","6299540"," let people accept five percent inflation for soft landing"
"kth2AISG-HM","6299540","6303380"," and i was like that's what they're gonna do i'm like as time passes uh we used to"

"kth2AISG-HM","6307060","6313700"," that you would see you would see uh they want time to pass so that you accept"
"kth2AISG-HM","6313700","6318500"," some inflation as permanent and we see that every"
"kth2AISG-HM","6318500","6323060"," decade or two uh for the scam to go on for the fraud to continue"
"kth2AISG-HM","6323060","6325940"," that's what they want to do so as you begin to accept"
"kth2AISG-HM","6325940","6329700"," higher prices um you'll see you'll see just a reversion"
"kth2AISG-HM","6329700","6334100"," back to what we used we've always done right now so this is a fundamental"
"kth2AISG-HM","6334100","6336900"," argument at least publicly in this hearing"
"kth2AISG-HM","6336900","6342020"," about do we revert back to 1950s 1960s or uh do we"
"kth2AISG-HM","6342020","6345380"," do we turn the cocaine back on the cocaine uh"

"kth2AISG-HM","10394900","10399300"," white line down here okay and you're going to be looking for i'm going to tell you exactly what"
"kth2AISG-HM","10399300","10405940"," you're looking for here okay you're coming into a four trigger cluster right now there is a daily"
"kth2AISG-HM","10405940","10411060"," trigger an hourly is actually an hourly hourly trigger right here show to you above"
"kth2AISG-HM","10413540","10424340"," 40276 right here there's an hourly trigger right here it's green"
"kth2AISG-HM","10426820","10430740"," so right there there's an hourly trigger there's a daily trigger there's a five-minute"
"kth2AISG-HM","10430740","10434740"," no one minute right here that's what you're going to be going to draw this out you can"
"kth2AISG-HM","10434740","10438900"," snap this for yourself snap picture of this whatever you want to do and i'll show you what"
"kth2AISG-HM","10438900","10447380"," you're looking for here okay you get the red line right here and you get the white line"
"kth2AISG-HM","10447380","10453700"," matter of fact it's really cool is this tool that we have uh has predictive uh trigger lines like"
"kth2AISG-HM","10454100","10464100"," they lead before price gets there you want to see the green line come underneath believe it or not"
"kth2AISG-HM","10464100","10471140"," oopsie you want to see the green line come underneath right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10473860","10475220"," and you want to see the yellow line"
"kth2AISG-HM","10475220","10486260"," right here get underneath right here and you want to see price"
"kth2AISG-HM","10489780","10496020"," get above right here now price can come right here it's right around there like right in there"
"kth2AISG-HM","10496020","10503140"," if this develops and price can get above right here it should be a squeeze a huge squeeze"
"kth2AISG-HM","10503220","10509780"," so a lot of money in here if that happens now until that happens you can't take the trade"
"kth2AISG-HM","10510580","10515220"," you're going to watch this consolidates it'll trade down to the one-minute price needs to stay"
"kth2AISG-HM","10515220","10519860"," above it the one-minute this yellow white line needs to get above the red line needs to take"
"kth2AISG-HM","10519860","10524180"," price above the daily and the hourly trigger that's right over here i'm going to show it to you"
"kth2AISG-HM","10524980","10532580"," here in just a moment so you can visualize it right here for yourself so you see right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10532580","10536980"," so that gunshot move right here and this is called a four-trigger cluster"
"kth2AISG-HM","10539860","10544020"," the one-minute's kind of weak though right see how this one-minute velocity is coming down"
"kth2AISG-HM","10544020","10547460"," so the one-minute's kind of weak here uh five minutes not so good"
"kth2AISG-HM","10548020","10554180"," hourly is kind of like hourly's rough right here uh so the the best trade of this"
"kth2AISG-HM","10554180","10558580"," the best trade in here uh is to allow price to lead higher"
"kth2AISG-HM","10559460","10565540"," and allow all this stuff to catch up allow this to get underneath and allow this to get underneath"
"kth2AISG-HM","10565540","10570020"," and then it becomes an explosive move higher and that's where you get your clothes above right there"
"kth2AISG-HM","10570980","10577460"," to see if i can mute the um so we got to mute the book map here so you can see it"
"kth2AISG-HM","10579140","10584900"," um and you want to see this is a close called a four-trig cluster area one two three and four"
"kth2AISG-HM","10585460","10589380"," and uh you need this white line here in price to stay above it"
"kth2AISG-HM","10590340","10594820"," and you need these other these other triggers to get underneath price these can get underneath"
"kth2AISG-HM","10594820","10600740"," price it gets very explosive uh you can actually get a nice giant squeeze in the market so we'll see"
"kth2AISG-HM","10600740","10605860"," we'll see how this plays out into the clothes uh some people might think this is the top it might"
"kth2AISG-HM","10605860","10612180"," not be these kind of clusters here can lead to giant moves higher so we'll look and see if we can"
"kth2AISG-HM","10612260","10616100"," actually trade higher i'm not sure this is going to happen but if this does develop over the course"
"kth2AISG-HM","10616100","10622980"," today uh you could see a squeeze into the clothes so we will look at it we will look at it and we're"
"kth2AISG-HM","10622980","10630580"," not going to guarantee this uh but we are going to look you've got the pivot line above 40532 and"
"kth2AISG-HM","10630580","10637220"," you can actually squeeze higher than this um not guaranteed uh this so this here is just an"
"kth2AISG-HM","10637300","10643700"," hourly trigger but uh you know to get 40532 might be on the table uh you can possibly even get"
"kth2AISG-HM","10643700","10649780"," 406 uh that's even a possibility believe it or not there's a little bit of uh see the scene of"
"kth2AISG-HM","10649780","10658340"," the crime back here it actually extends to the day before at 40668 uh so we'll look to see how"
"kth2AISG-HM","10658340","10666580"," this opens up uh we're going to put r1 as uh pt2 uh we'll do this as a bar that means pt3 so we'll"
"kth2AISG-HM","10666580","10676020"," write um let me see in a second here we're pt3 above i think that would be pt3 if this develops you"
"kth2AISG-HM","10676100","10680900"," gotta we gotta we gotta let this play out uh pt3"
"kth2AISG-HM","10684180","10684740"," right there"
"kth2AISG-HM","10688180","10691940"," uh we'll do a pt2 more likely right there"
"kth2AISG-HM","10695860","10697060"," we'll make that one yellow"
"kth2AISG-HM","10699460","10704340"," right about there even just a failure of this actually makes a little lower like right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10704420","10705380"," there's your pt2"
"kth2AISG-HM","10709300","10711700"," that's gonna be a tough one man i think that's pt3"
"kth2AISG-HM","10712900","10717300"," 40532 that's right man i think i think the one above it's gonna be difficult"
"kth2AISG-HM","10718900","10726980"," but it's there at least pt2 pt3 failure to close right here somewhere in there that's with the"
"kth2AISG-HM","10727620","10733940"," the sellers are at for today at least um these sellers appear kind of weak the real sellers are"
"kth2AISG-HM","10733940","10737620"," up here at rr3 r1 at least we know this is where the real sellers are above"
"kth2AISG-HM","10739300","10744340"," and um we know that the bull the bears want to stay under here we know well you know the bears are"
"kth2AISG-HM","10744340","10748260"," down here now right we know the bears came down here they sold this shit down they sold it down"
"kth2AISG-HM","10748900","10755540"," and they sold this down uh so you know can we get up here maybe we get up there to the"
"kth2AISG-HM","10755540","10760900"," end of the day possible possible you need to see what this you need to see what this does right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10760980","10766260"," this is this is going to matter um for the rest of today if you can get above this zone right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10766260","10773060"," if bulls can get price above uh four zero two fifty or something like that it should start"
"kth2AISG-HM","10773060","10779220"," squeezing pretty violently up to the upside uh so we'll see if this works itself out if we do get"
"kth2AISG-HM","10779220","10785220"," that squeeze higher be aware if you are a bear at least uh that there is the possibility of a"
"kth2AISG-HM","10785220","10790260"," giant squeeze forming right in this zone right here now bears need to keep the pressure on"
"kth2AISG-HM","10791060","10794420"," uh if they don't keep the pressure on here it's going to get it's going to get whippy"
"kth2AISG-HM","10797300","10800900"," it's going to get whippy really fast so just be just be careful of that if you're a bear"
"kth2AISG-HM","10802900","10807300"," and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take a break uh i'm going to take a five-minute break"
"kth2AISG-HM","10807300","10810180"," fifteen break if you're going to take a piss or something like that or you're going to get a"
"kth2AISG-HM","10810180","10816180"," sandwich ham sandwich a sammy uh there should be some work that needs to be done in here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10816980","10820820"," uh some kind of some kind of work so it could get violent here's my point"
"kth2AISG-HM","10821540","10825620"," uh and if you do end up going up it's going to be a blast off like rocket ship kind of thing"
"kth2AISG-HM","10827220","10830820"," do i think that there's still shorts the market fuck yeah they're right here they're right"
"kth2AISG-HM","10830820","10835940"," fucking here uh the next place that there is right here the next place there is right here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10835940","10840020"," and the big place that they uh jumped in on was yesterday right remember we were sitting up there"
"kth2AISG-HM","10840020","10845460"," yesterday like that's by a bunch of puts and see where price goes uh so you guys already know"
"kth2AISG-HM","10845540","10850500"," that we're in the down move down move right now is complete until tomorrow i don't think this"
"kth2AISG-HM","10850500","10858820"," senate hearing is going to be that big of a deal tomorrow but um like not as big i think the bigger"
"kth2AISG-HM","10858820","10866020"," thing tomorrow is adp and then jolt and british book mostly jolt and adp uh trade balance is"
"kth2AISG-HM","10866020","10871380"," important ish uh but then claims are really important on thursday and the employment"

"kth2AISG-HM","10877460","10883140"," you've got volatility set up for the rest of the week so uh we could get really squeezy here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10884020","10889380"," we know that this pivot is for negative uh negative gamma in the market but above it we're in positive"
"kth2AISG-HM","10889380","10895460"," gamma so you know if we get to the pivot at least that wouldn't surprise me today uh maybe a high"
"kth2AISG-HM","10895460","10901540"," target of four zero five three two if we can get above uh all this consolidation down below here"
"kth2AISG-HM","10903460","10909620"," let me take a quick break um quick break for you and you can see where support is down below uh"
