"113720","115760"," Check one to heck."
"120080","120580"," Yeah."
"121300","122340"," People starting to roll in. "
"129380","130380"," We got here."
"130800","132960"," Customization subscribers."
"136680","137640"," See you. "
"138380","141080"," Gotta make sure that I'm ready for the open here."
"143240","145520"," I don't have my brokerage open."
"153870","162420"," What is going on?"
"162580","163380"," This is one of my brothers. "
"170320","171040"," Yeah, baby."
"171180","171560"," Good morning."
"172100","173160"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"173960","175000"," Let me just a second here. "
"176660","177420"," How are you doing?"
"177580","178680"," Dirty dogs doing out there?"
"196120","197340"," Two is out there right now."
"197420","198960"," I'm going to start reading the chat this morning."
"200200","201900"," How are y'all doing out there this morning?"
"202060","202780"," Everybody doing all right?"
"203400","204300"," Where's Chase Winter?"
"205780","208180"," We're talking about this yesterday, right?"
"210480","211060"," I mean. "
"211060","214080"," We're talking about this yesterday at the bell, right?"
"214900","219960"," Every day we go through what we expect for the next day and then the week and stuff like that."
"220060","221280"," Of course, you know plans change."
"222300","223600"," Netty gas is up this morning. "
"223800","225260"," They don't have a reason for it being up."
"225400","229880"," Someone was asking about netty gas yesterday into the bell and I figured it was going to go down"
"229880","230300"," some more."
"230940","231580"," It's not. "
"231860","232060"," You can."
"233840","235640"," Let's look at boil this morning real quick."
"235840","236700"," I was looking at it earlier. "
"238880","241040"," It's banging up 3.4% here."
"244960","247440"," It's got a little little bump this morning."
"248920","252360"," It's coming off slightly, but that happens sometimes with natural gas and oil. "
"254500","255880"," Good signs here."
"256339","260320"," We'll try to get some more information as to why I got a bump and maybe maybe it does get"
"260320","261040"," pushed up today."
"261200","262380"," Maybe this this holds. "
"263100","264580"," We did have some previous demand here."
"264740","265700"," I mean, I'm not going to give it."
"266020","267100"," I'm not going to say no to it. "
"267780","270540"," I was looking for 2340 1701, but."
"271320","274720"," You know, there was demand here prior early December."
"274920","276180"," There's real risk here though. "
"276480","278840"," Historically, you'll see a roll over at some points."
"278940","280760"," Just be careful with netty gas."
"282960","285200"," Just seasonally, it starts to roll at some point. "
"285880","286680"," So be careful with it."
"288340","291120"," And we're going to go over to SPY, baby."
"292900","294400"," We're going over SPY. "
"295900","296340"," Oh."
"299280","300480"," Look at the hash."
"303340","304220"," There's some. "
"304480","305040"," There's some."
"306660","312100"," You know, there's going to be a promise of a promise land of us going up before I read you"
"312100","313240"," what you guys are saying in the comments."
"313960","316180"," I want to talk to you about something about yesterday. "
"316860","319320"," And you can see this right here, right?"
"320880","322220"," I want to."
"322600","323260"," There's a couple things."
"323600","324220"," I haven't found out. "
"324360","326000"," I haven't read where gamma is this morning."
"326000","329100"," I'll work on this as the market opens."
"329120","329800"," I'm going to have to. "
"329800","332020"," Just a couple of things."
"332320","334080"," There could be a spike up on the bell, right?"
"334160","334940"," Sometimes that happens."
"335300","335880"," And then a reversal. "
"337040","338000"," For a dip to buy."
"338960","343180"," They can also sometimes be a dip right off the bell and then we move higher."
"343740","347820"," If we start to sell off the bell, we're going to be looking for 382 50. "
"348280","353180"," We had some supportive move there, but in truth, you're looking back here."
"353180","357180"," Where this close was for a dip by if you can, right?"
"357420","358440"," So if we can trade down here."
"359200","362300"," And then you get the promise land, maybe by Christmas up here. "
"365700","367240"," So let's be careful of that."
"367920","369540"," You guys know my feelings on."
"369640","370800"," You guys know my feelings on. "
"372240","374800"," Zero dates, directional moves overnight."
"375360","379180"," And you know, they can blast right up off the bell, but I'll be honest with you."
"379180","382740"," I've got train rules and you guys know what my train rules are on directional moves. "
"384160","385660"," There can be a moment or two."
"385780","387980"," You might want to wait for it depends if it's set to tell right away."
"387980","390440"," Sometimes it clicks the price you want. "
"390540","391220"," You got to get right out."
"391860","397840"," If it's going to blast up, sometimes it'll not show you the real price and then it'll blast up."
"397940","399340"," So it could be like 15 seconds. "
"400060","402300"," You should know right off the bell where we're going here."
"402520","409160"," If you didn't take this trade yesterday, you're looking for it."
"409160","413220"," I'm assuming foamables are like, I'm going to buy this dip and I'm going to buy this dip. "
"413480","415100"," Please don't run, run straight up."
"416560","420940"," If it does gap up, I'm going to expect it to at least at least gap up to the previous"
"420940","423520"," eye and pre market and then sell down."
"423760","425580"," So keep that in mind here, right?"
"427040","428900"," Those are holding overnight that don't care. "
"429060","430320"," They're like, you know, fuck it."
"430400","431660"," I want to hit our two right off the bell."
"432600","433460"," I get it. "
"433560","434560"," You guys do whatever you need to do."
"435900","436740"," I know what I do."
"436840","438860"," You guys know what I do on directional moves. "
"440240","445240"," If you decide to take the gap up and it doesn't gap up, I'll tell you something else that happens."
"445520","453400"," Sometimes off a bell, we will sometimes off a bell will actually sell off and then it gaps and"
"453400","453780"," tags."
"453780","459740"," So if you get caught in that, sometimes holding will get you what you want up here anyways, or"
"459740","467260"," leaving gap even higher, then it'll come back down and you'll get your heart, you'll get your, you"
"467260","469160"," know, your holiday rally for today. "
"469440","472860"," Now, is there a chance that we could sell off the bell and this is it?"
"474220","474660"," Sure."
"474980","477460"," But, you know, let's look at the hourly here, right?"
"478040","481180"," We know we're teeing off of here, right?"
"484820","489760"," So, you know, we're looking for, you know, a return to this 20, you know, for, you know, for, you"
"489760","493420"," know, for continuation stop losses underneath, right?"
"493540","496780"," If it starts to trade under, you know, that we're going to reverse here at some point, right?"
"497220","503040"," So we'll keep track of the 20 me on the one hour for trend and see, you know, and see"
"503040","507660"," what this means, how far it goes, how long it goes, entries for anyone that's not long right now"
"507660","509860"," that wants to take a long into the 23rd."
"509860","511000"," 20 days we got left here. "
"511320","511919"," Not many, right?"
"512140","512299"," Two days."
"512940","513600"," You got two days left."
"515080","517760"," So, we'll keep watching this as day unfolds. "
"518539","521039"," If you're a bear and you want to short this, right?"
"521600","523260"," You know, you're looking for that hourly trend change."
"523600","524780"," That's basically what you're looking for."
"524980","525900"," You don't need time all this. "
"526480","530440"," You just need to grab this underneath here and start selling it back down to Thursday, Friday,"
"531220","532680"," Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, whatever it is."
"534480","537560"," If Chase is in the house, I don't know if he's here right now, but I don't know if any"
"537560","541500"," of you are here right now that we're here yesterday into yesterday's bell, but if you were here"
"541500","542840"," yesterday into the bell."
"544000","548520"," And we were talking about doing some strangles and straddles and the last minute, I'm like, you"
"548520","548740"," know what?"
"549120","549960"," It's fucking holidays. "
"550400","554740"," I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, all right, Chase."
"555240","556000"," Let's do this."
"556320","557620"," And boom, baby. "
"558340","558640"," Boom."
"558880","559880"," Actually added some more."
"560640","561880"," I was in the phone with Joe yesterday. "
"562320","565480"," After this rollover, I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to DCA this."
"566480","567080"," I did."
"568940","571060"," So I do say DCA down in here somewhere. "
"572140","573340"," I'm some kind of happy this morning."
"573940","577140"," Okay, so let's see here."
"577300","580960"," Well, you guys want to go in the one minute and see around the one minute right here, so we'll"
"580960","581800"," see what's going on. "
"583480","586020"," We'll bring up BookMap for you so you can see what's up."
"591220","595980"," And I wouldn't really trust BookMap in pre-market either."
"596200","597300"," We only have two minutes left. "
"597760","599140"," We got a gap down below here too."
"600320","603280"," But I wouldn't really always trust BookMap in pre-market."
"603460","606920"," They're not usually supportive in pre-market. "
"606920","610200"," When we hit cash market, rug pull."
"611040","612940"," Sometimes you'll see resistance on BookMap."
"613460","616880"," We hit cash market, rug above pull. "
"617240","622920"," So it would be very wary of what BookMap tells you early in the morning."
"623220","626200"," So as we open the bell, I will take care of it."
"626480","627440"," You know you got Sarah Gamma here. "
"628660","632520"," We are in positive Gamma, so we'll put this right here for now."
"633240","638060"," And then I'll check the Gamma levels when I have a chance."
"638500","642880"," I'm going to try to take some profit at some point off the spell, so I don't want to lose"
"642880","644320"," all my money. "
"649580","650280"," So good morning."
"650460","651680"," Happy holidays to all of you out there."
"653640","655060"," Let's see what you guys are saying. "
"655200","656700"," We got at least a minute here, right?"
"657020","660680"," So I'll go through the chat this morning."
"660680","664720"," And good morning, kid time."
"664920","665300"," Chase Winter. "
"665520","666400"," Good morning, my brother."
"667180","667600"," Robin."
"667600","668140"," Good morning. "
"668340","668720"," Wean Lam."
"669080","669480"," Good morning."

"673540","673580"," Garrett."
"674240","674240"," Matthew. "
"675120","675980"," Johnny Moog's baby."
"676780","677000"," Pinky."
"677260","677460"," Nick S."
"677860","678140"," Ross walks. "
"678440","678640"," Pinky."
"678740","679020"," I apologize."
"679180","680500"," I wasn't able to call you last night. "
"680880","681360"," I was whooped."
"681640","682660"," I was so tired last night."
"683540","683800"," Legal honesty. "
"684980","686640"," Thanks, Chase, for hitting that like button, brother."
"687120","690660"," Thanks for asking people to hit that."
"690660","690980"," Good morning. "
"690980","691380"," Good morning."
"691380","691800"," How are you?"
"694500","695040"," Thank you."
"695100","696960"," Good time for the shout out on that stuff last night. "
"696980","697520"," Tony Cheese."
"697680","697980"," Good morning."
"699420","700540"," Good morning, RS. "
"703280","703940"," Ryan Morris."
"703940","704420"," Good morning."
"704540","705140"," Robin Dean. "
"705620","706160"," Tony Cheese."
"706960","707520"," Pinky face."
"707520","708180"," Good morning, my brother. "
"708240","708800"," How are you doing?"
"711500","711880"," Nike."
"712000","712780"," We don't see for the open."
"713220","714520"," I haven't even looked at it, Nike. "
"715640","716780"," Will he smoke meat?"
"716940","717220"," Good morning."
"722900","727020"," Let me see you guys saying Vicks got crushed yesterday at Barris and golfing on the daily baby."
"727400","727660"," Palm. "
"727680","728160"," Good morning."
"730120","731060"," We can pop."
"731420","733160"," Chase is saying bad crops, weather war. "
"733740","737120"," I see some prominent Elliot who were saying that this really could go to 440."
"737840","738660"," No shit, huh?"
"739660","740100"," Will."
"740260","740660"," Will. "
"740720","741040"," Shelts."
"741140","741380"," Good morning."
"741420","741820"," How are you?"
"742660","743780"," Which time we got left here?"
"744560","744840"," Hold on. "
"744920","745840"," I got to check this real quick."
"746040","747120"," We only got 10 seconds left."
"747220","747800"," We just second here. "
"754700","756140"," One second, baby."
"756140","757020"," I"
"757020","776220"," love"
"776220","776780"," free money."
"776780","783780"," Thank you. "
"809900","811680"," Little bit of pump right off the bell here."
"823060","825860"," See if we can tag at least this previous high here."
"827740","828920"," See if we can do it. "
"829040","830760"," This pre-market high is right here."
"838440","839660"," Are they going to do it?"
"839760","840160"," I sold."
"840420","843180"," I took my money and ran just to heads up any of you out there. "
"846780","848840"," Got a small gap down below here as well."
"849140","849900"," I want you to see this gap."
"851460","858180"," It's 33.1.75. There's a small gap above as well. "
"858660","868620"," Tiny one right here at 33.82. See what you guys"
"868620","869020"," are saying."
"875410","876390"," Holy shit."
"876490","877110"," Good job, Winky. "
"878590","882510"," Winky's banking right now on Nike."
"883690","885310"," Never leaving cap."
"894730","896650"," Let's see. "
"897390","899910"," I thought legal honesty."
"900150","903150"," I thought it was just the final numbers."
"904750","910390"," Isn't Friday's data just the final numbers, not actual new numbers?"
"910950","911710"," Let me know in the chat. "
"912270","912990"," Good morning, Nicholas."
"917290","923050"," Yeah, my YouTube channel qualifies for membership."
"923370","924510"," Should I do a membership, Winky?"
"924510","931430"," Winky is stoked this morning. "
"931830","933810"," He was talking about Nike yesterday."
"934770","935650"," He must be pumped."
"941490","945390"," Winky, do you want me to do memberships on YouTube or something or what do you want me to do?"
"954990","955730"," Yeah, Winky. "
"956110","958290"," Winky's a gangster when it comes to stock picks."
"958790","959770"," Straight gangster."
"968810","970190"," I see what you're saying. "
"971090","972890"," Bloomberg charges like $0.99 a month."
"973150","976170"," Chat with maybe a way to add some value to users, et"
"976170","984490"," cetera, in the future."
"984490","988490"," I'm trying to find a way to pay for all of this. "
"989710","993770"," I'm trying to find a way to pay for all of this where you guys don't see it."
"995870","997690"," So I'm trying to work with."
"998570","1001830"," I'm trying to set this up so that there's some SEO stuff with Google. "
"1001830","1011130"," Google has this, they have a heart on for like, they want to see everyday live streams and classes"
"1011130","1016830"," and all this other nonsense, not nonsense, but they want to see this stuff easily SEO to cross a"
"1016830","1017050"," website."
"1017890","1020710"," So Twitter is like, I like Twitter and all that."
"1020970","1021450"," I love Twitter. "
"1021690","1022010"," I love Discord."
"1022510","1029170"," But Google is like, if you go through Google as your your daddy or whatever, it can sometimes be"
"1029170","1029470"," seamless."
"1030210","1036230"," I don't know if I'll be able to do that, but we're trying in the background to just keep everything"
"1036230","1038250"," open and free at all times. "
"1039810","1041230"," And so it's seamless."
"1044030","1045109"," But I get what you're saying."
"1045869","1049950"," Oftentimes you'll see people on Twitter, they'll have like a patreon. "
"1051550","1053390"," And then they, everything's behind a paywall."
"1053690","1055350"," It's just the easiest, simplest thing to do."
"1056350","1059190"," But you're still on their platform and stuff like that. "
"1059330","1060710"," You're on, you're on patreon's platform."
"1061150","1062250"," You're on Twitter's platform."
"1062730","1064750"," You're like, always dependent upon somebody else. "

"1088610","1091050"," Yes, that it's members only on Fed Day and stuff like that."
"1091170","1093210"," Yeah, that's a fair point to Winky."
"1093510","1094150"," I like that idea. "
"1094470","1099430"," That's the one thing about Fed Day and stuff like that is we can do member only."
"1099590","1100610"," I like the idea of that too."
"1101630","1102810"," Yeah, I get what you're saying, man. "
"1103290","1107450"," Like 99 cents and then specific days, it's just members only."
"1108010","1111970"," Or maybe it's just a day or two week or I won't rip it or something."

"1143530","1146350"," They don't care."
"1154410","1156970"," I was going to start. "
"1157610","1161390"," I built a Twitch page and some other page."
"1162030","1167370"," I think Facebook or something and in the background, I can stream to all these different platforms"
"1167370","1170190"," that haven't started yet, but we're going to start."
"1170710","1171970"," So there'll be. "

"1212830","1215210"," Being under that stick is kind of the worst thing in the world."
"1217030","1218930"," I have I have straight torched accounts."
"1220230","1221450"," Like big ones. "
"1223950","1226610"," Yeah, that's a rough rough rough thing."
"1227210","1228010"," Torturing an account."
"1229710","1231090"," The psychology of it is crazy. "
"1233590","1238230"," The psychology of it's like I've ended up feeling like I'm the worst person in the entire world."

"1254010","1259430"," They like ropey in and then the swift reversal and that's where you should have bought."
"1267250","1272310"," I want to see if we would gap above that 383 78."
"1275270","1277330"," We'll snap it on the line right there. "
"1279510","1280650"," That's like right there."
"1292490","1293970"," I have blown up like 10."
"1298970","1299710"," Good morning, Guru. "

"1309190","1310410"," What does the on stand for?"
"1319430","1322030"," He has a gap right here at a three to three 77. "
"1322430","1325750"," There's the previous high right here."
"1334070","1339770"," Came right off of this pre market bounce and trying to make our way higher right now."
"1349550","1350990"," Let me make sure that. "

"1357830","1358130"," morning."
"1358910","1360750"," They said that they didn't know why it was up."
"1362610","1366370"," I'm going to assume that if they didn't have a reason why nanny gas was up that. "
"1369430","1374110"," It was just a squeeze more than a news driven rise in natural gas."
"1379390","1380610"," AMD is ripping this morning."
"1380730","1381090"," I like AMD. "
"1381810","1382730"," It's one of the first."
"1386990","1393210"," It's one of the first tickers that I ever learned how to consistently trade on."
"1393850","1399290"," If you're a new trader, AMD is one of the best new trader communities. "
"1400030","1405370"," If you get involved with AMD traders, it's very consistent usually whether it's going up"
"1405370","1412710"," or down."
"1412710","1414170"," Let's take a look at Tesla real quick."
"1420510","1421770"," This right real quick. "

"1448490","1450470"," So the gap is right here. "
"1451010","1453730"," This is where the gap is on on Tesla."
"1454770","1457050"," I was talking to Joe in the belly yesterday."
"1458510","1462050"," As a matter of fact I told you guys if I told you guys if we hit one thirty six"

"1463190","1464730"," Just give me a shout out on Twitter."
"1467110","1471930"," So the gap is actually down below one thirty six oh seven but I was talking to Joe donut yesterday."
"1472670","1476350"," And I said I was like I don't want to say this on Twitter to somebody I was talking on"
"1476350","1477190"," Twitter yesterday. "
"1479050","1482550"," And oh yeah baby."
"1483210","1484070"," There's the tap."
"1484950","1486350"," There it is right there. "
"1486950","1488330"," That's the gap fill right there."
"1488470","1489750"," That's the full gap fill on Tesla."
"1491130","1495290"," I was talking to Joe and we were talking about what's the average buy in for. "
"1496870","1501070"," He asked me he said what do you think people are in for Tesla on average and I said 200"
"1501070","1504330"," bucks and he goes one ninety five or one ninety six."
"1504330","1508430"," Oh yeah look at that tap."
"1508950","1514170"," Look at some calls right now on Tesla hold"
"1517660","1527340"," on"
"1527340","1536280"," one thirty nine. "

"1540460","1544320"," So he said one ninety sorry I said 200 he goes one ninety six."
"1545360","1547640"," And how the conversation had arisen was. "
"1549360","1551880"," How the conversation had arisen was."
"1553100","1557280"," I was discussing the split so we are right now."
"1557280","1563100"," And the number of people that had purchased shares available on Tesla. "
"1566000","1572300"," Has grown right or the number of shares available has grown since where we are right now here."
"1573020","1576080"," So the float back there again."
"1576280","1579720"," Yeah the float back there is much smaller than above here. "
"1580780","1582280"," So if you start seeing."
"1583400","1588840"," So dude at Jeff James I want to do that almost a perfect strike down here."
"1589700","1590840"," Look at that. "
"1591100","1593560"," Oh perfect."
"1594860","1599820"," So we were talking about and I was like no we start heading lower on Tesla here."
"1601000","1606200"," You've got like all these buyers above and not that many buyers below. "
"1606200","1613060"," So you could really start seeing a heavy and hard move down to these lower numbers."
"1619900","1620780"," Oh look at that."
"1620960","1623320"," They tagged it right in cash market unreal. "
"1624340","1626720"," Tesla now moving higher one thirty eight forty eight."

"1639020","1640760"," Just tag just slammed it."
"1640860","1641660"," This is like algorithm."
"1641940","1643380"," This is all alga stuff right here. "
"1643820","1646640"," They couldn't get it done yesterday so they came in and did it today."
"1647200","1649260"," This is the entire this is the entire."
"1650080","1651240"," See if we can look at. "
"1654320","1656400"," Is the entire move right there."
"1657420","1657960"," There it is."
"1657960","1660220"," You want to see it for posterity sake. "
"1662280","1663680"," Look at it right there."
"1664340","1667180"," Look at that the whole move."
"1667880","1669180"," There's a little bit down here. "
"1669320","1671920"," It's a little bit down there but see that little."
"1672240","1673520"," So you can show this to you."
"1676320","1677500"," It's right here. "
"1681640","1682680"," Right there."
"1683380","1684760"," One thirty six oh seven."
"1685440","1687620"," They just blasted right through it right there. "
"1687620","1689960"," And look at that."
"1690980","1692140"," They nailed it."
"1694540","1695320"," Right there. "
"1695440","1696240"," Here's a push right here."
"1696260","1697020"," Push right here."
"1697240","1697840"," Push right here. "
"1698460","1700300"," Now that that's not really a push right there."
"1700460","1701780"," We don't we have like three right there."
"1702660","1703940"," We got gaps below. "
"1704360","1705760"," You want to see where the gaps below are."
"1707120","1709220"," And Tesla will we'll slap them in there."
"1714160","1716060"," See guys have some reference points. "
"1718360","1719960"," Oh there's one right there."
"1723200","1724620"," Put this one in here."
"1727240","1730840"," Go away back baby way back on Tesla for gaps. "
"1732500","1733360"," One here."
"1737560","1738620"," Here's another one."
"1748100","1748840"," Right there. "
"1748920","1751020"," That's eighty one dollars ninety five dollars."
"1751240","1753560"," I mean you do you're not talking that that long ago."
"1758260","1759800"," I don't see any gaps there. "
"1762740","1764800"," Those are the two lower gaps down here."
"1767380","1772080"," So ninety and I think I was saying ninety six dollars but maybe I'll change to these two gaps right"
"1772080","1772300"," here."
"1772300","1778320"," And we're rocket shipping on on on Tesla right now. "
"1778780","1779800"," Just blasting."
"1780180","1781860"," So there's the tag you finally got it."
"1781900","1784200"," So we talk about this often in the live stream right we say. "
"1784980","1788580"," The algorithms want to come down and hit key areas."
"1789240","1793100"," And you're seeing that get hit this morning on Tesla right."
"1803760","1805360"," Then the algorithms hit it. "
"1805620","1811580"," So good job on Tesla getting rid of that that tag that erases the entire gap on Tesla right now."
"1814460","1815820"," One two pump."
"1816540","1817920"," It's a nice set up for bulls. "
"1818820","1822840"," Whenever you see what I was paying attention to Tesla if I had seen this right here what I bought"
"1822840","1823480"," that in a heartbeat."
"1825020","1827160"," It's a perfect bull set up right here."
"1832300","1834480"," Now I wish that I wish I had traded spy. "
"1838280","1842240"," You know a little face ripper right now on on Tesla so I missed this trade."
"1843040","1845740"," I'm a little upset about missing this trade but whatever."
"1851620","1852580"," Shit happens. "
"1861940","1867060"," You get a nice you get a nice little rally out of this gap is now closed on spy."
"1880720","1883320"," Oh yeah that was a great place to buy calls down Tesla."
"1884340","1885780"," That's just all that is the computer. "
"1886000","1889840"," It's just a computer that wants to hit that lower number close that gap up and start heading."
"1890480","1896260"," There was no bearishness on that on that opening bell that all that is is just numbers in the"
"1896260","1896620"," background."
"1897500","1899900"," Cleaning up the mess down below that didn't happen yesterday. "
"1906000","1910120"," So my upside target on Tesla is you guys want to see an upside target on Tesla."
"1911820","1915280"," I think it was I think I had it at one."
"1916520","1917900"," Hold on a second. "
"1919260","1921860"," Trying to see what I had for an upside target on Tesla yesterday."
"1922420","1923340"," Into the bell."
"1925760","1927240"," Wait a minute give me a second here. "
"1934400","1940580"," So you know you're going to expect at least 169 ish as time passes you might it will come down"
"1940580","1948260"," every day but so yesterday was 169 off the bottom and then today it's going to be 167 58 is"
"1948260","1948960"," an upside target."
"1948960","1951280"," Believe it or not."
"1951740","1953700"," I know you're not going to believe that but that is true. "
"1955220","1957880"," What we'll do is there's something out."
"1958040","1961440"," So when I said when I was on Twitter yesterday I said buy Tesla much to show you why I"
"1961440","1961820"," said that."
"1962300","1964160"," You guys want to know why I said that yesterday I'll show you. "
"1968460","1969480"," So let me clear."
"1969480","1974200"," He chose chief Ted Ross says he's concerned about increasing COVID cases in China."
"1975380","1976280"," Give me a second. "
"1976400","1977780"," I'll explain to you why."
"1979060","1980840"," I'm going to delete all the drawings on Tesla."
"1981940","1985020"," And the reason reason I what I had done was I had measured. "
"1986520","1989780"," This move down here yesterday or here."
"1990180","1990800"," Wherever it was."
"1991540","1996080"," I had measured this move down yesterday and it was a hundred percent. "
"1996080","2002100"," The top of the hour do you get the release of the US conference board consumer confidence for"
"2002100","2008980"," December forecast 101 on the prior 100 spot to the range of 105 to 98."
"2009420","2014820"," You also get the US existing home sales November data forecast for spot 2 million."
"2015900","2020440"," So this was this move was the largest move. "
"2021680","2024800"," That had taken place on Tesla the entire year."
"2024940","2025620"," So I had measured it out."
"2025740","2026160"," It was exact. "
"2026580","2027360"," It was like a hundred percent."
"2027580","2028300"," So I was like oh no."
"2029020","2033900"," I was like this is a computer that's selling selling exact on Tesla. "
"2035100","2040100"," So what we'll do is we'll take a look at some some places."
"2042040","2043860"," See if they can do a one hour maybe."
"2047739","2053760"," So this whole move here was almost an exact 100% of the biggest move on Tesla. "
"2054540","2056880"," So I was like this is too close to a place."
"2057480","2058239"," It's almost the exact."
"2063170","2064870"," It's almost exactly the move. "
"2065150","2065929"," Hold on a second here."
"2083790","2086389"," One, two, three, four."
"2087250","2088590"," You're going to call that maybe a move. "
"2090710","2093389"," It was a little bit of a retracement in here."
"2101240","2102660"," That's really it right there."
"2102940","2105260"," I don't know if you're going to call that a true retracement. "

"2528650","2530130"," So this is zero gamma right here. "
"2530190","2530810"," We're gonna turn this yellow."
"2531270","2531870"," So it matches."
"2533230","2542870"," This is zero gamma right where we are right now Eight four"
"2542870","2547610"," six four six, so what about a buck off roughly a buck off?"
"2548670","2558210"," So Positive gamma is 10 seconds somewhere up here"
"2558210","2560670"," roughly here on spy. "
"2560850","2562150"," I'm trying to calculate this for spy."
"2562390","2566310"," This positive gamma is up here I'm gonna assume it's coming out of this anything above this area up"
"2566310","2571570"," here Any positive one hundred and eight spot three one hundred and eight spot three that's higher"
"2571570","2577250"," than the forecast of one hundred and one US existing home sales of four spot zero nine million four"
"2577250","2581930"," four zero nine million lower than forecast for spot two million existing home sales change minus"
"2581930","2586310"," seven spot seven percent minus seven spot seven percent that is lower than the forecast of minus"
"2586310","2591390"," five spot one nine per cent to look into the market some upside movement in US stocks here and the"
"2591390","2595330"," dollar also seeing some upside movement as well as seeing a little pick sorted outside."
"2598590","2599210"," Hold on here. "
"2599270","2603190"," We meet this for you or let me pause this for you so you can see where negative gamma is"
"2603190","2608910"," negative gamma is also noting the US November national medium home price for existing home to three"
"2608910","2613790"," hundred seventy thousand seven hundred which is up three spot five percent from November 2021"
"2632510","2641930"," negative gamma down here zero gamma red down here and then positive gamma is somewhere so three"
"2641930","2643410"," nine positive gamma right"
"2643410","2658390"," now"
"2658390","2661730"," is Oh shit so it's even even lower."
"2669540","2675160"," So noting the prior revisions here consumer confidence prior vice to one hundred and one spot four"
"2675160","2676860"," from one hundred spot two."
"2677920","2681920"," I'm trying to do the math in my head right now to get you guys an SPX. "
"2690180","2692780"," Let's look at it on an SPX chart so you can see it."
"2699560","2704780"," And this is one year in consumer inflation rates expectations at six spot seven percent in December"
"2704780","2708860"," versus seven spot one percent in November according to the conference board a little bit lower to"
"2708860","2714520"," repeat that US one year consumer inflation rates expectations at six spot seven percent in December"
"2714520","2716860"," versus seven spot one percent in November."
"2717860","2724850"," Zero gammas right here and rate seven nine. "
"2726650","2732270"," We'll expansion right now in gamma today."
"2733570","2735170"," Just blasting off right now."
"2740710","2742590"," Just face ripping. "
"2771050","2776870"," Yeah I get an SPX zero gammas three eight four seven point one zero nine."
"2777750","2785970"," Me and then negative gammas thirty eight hundred flat and then positive gammas thirty eight and"
"2785970","2788090"," it's seventy nine thirty seven."
"2800670","2804770"," Well Chris is saying what happened I thought you might want to make the two displays in yellow"
"2804770","2808890"," green smaller for your stream yellow green. "
"2809230","2810550"," What are you guys talking about."
"2815690","2818950"," Now you're welcome Chris Chris what are you talking about here are you talking about."
"2821250","2825650"," We have posted out the US consumer car right here December twenty twenty two reports on the feed"
"2825650","2830110"," this part right the part down bullets is holiday rally or this part right here. "
"2831490","2837750"," Oh yeah so just so you guys know for my screener right the bottom the reason why this is closed"
"2837750","2841970"," off is because of the display resolution."
"2843070","2848590"," You guys wouldn't see the entire you guys wouldn't you guys wouldn't see the entire script you"
"2848590","2849250"," wouldn't be able to see."
"2850510","2855770"," The entire screener it's the it's the native resolution of YouTube versus my somebody my screen is"
"2855770","2856250"," really wide. "
"2857470","2859570"," It's more it has more to do with that than anything."
"2868090","2872510"," And then we do so because of that what I would have been a black screen or you wouldn't have"
"2872510","2873370"," seen enough."
"2874190","2880010"," I cut off information at the top and then when I cut that information off and just show it was"
"2880010","2882370"," so it's not discussion says I'm a speaking here. "
"2882370","2888590"," So I've got my screen right and then there's like a Google stuff at the top and a bunch of"
"2888590","2889890"," crap at the bottom you don't need to see."
"2890330","2896930"," So I try to capture just the part of the display for the for the chart."
"2898130","2904970"," When I do that it leaves the space at the bottom so I typically try to post upcoming events so"
"2904970","2908650"," people are aware of them on that little green box. "
"2910010","2913490"," But if you you know what I'll do is I'll try to look at it again today and see if"
"2913490","2916490"," I can get it to fit the screen better and if I can I will."
"2920570","2922650"," Let me work on that in the background some more."
"2929310","2930750"," Let me write that down hold on. "

"3345140","3346040"," Good to be with all of you guys. "
"3346820","3351640"," This is the first two holidays that we've spent where people have come to visit us."
"3351640","3352360"," So it's kind of neat."
"3352480","3354600"," We usually travel for holidays to share. "
"3354720","3356880"," We did Thanksgiving alone."
"3357040","3359080"," We had some family and friends stop by."
"3359300","3366100"," We visited in laws for the, I think it was the next weekend or the weekend before I can't remember. "
"3366440","3372730"," So this is the first year that we're doing kind of the home thing and it's been, it's been good."
"3372850","3373190"," I'm happy."
"3373470","3374830"," I'm very happy with this holiday. "
"3375250","3383450"," I feel like every holiday it's, it's brutal like traveling or having people or playing and all this"
"3383450","3384550"," other nonsense in this year."
"3384690","3385490"," It's been real nice."
"3386890","3391130"," I thought that I was getting rough this past week because I was doing a bunch of stuff with my"
"3391130","3397150"," wife to prepare for our own children and stuff, but it's been an easy holiday this year. "
"3397330","3397970"," So stoked."
"3407500","3408020"," Right on."
"3408080","3408960"," Yeah, it's good to have you guys here. "
"3409080","3409720"," Good to be with you guys."
"3412940","3414140"," I think in a small retrace."
"3415420","3417960"," Yeah, I'd like to see, well, so we're in a supportive. "
"3418660","3421040"," So the spy is supportive right now."
"3421200","3429100"," So you can see that VWAP here is VWAP right here."
"3429200","3432640"," You're going to, I'm going to look, I'm going to hope to see if we can get one more push"
"3432640","3433080"," up here. "
"3445780","3447120"," It's the same as always, right?"
"3447380","3448860"," We're at a resistance point here."
"3449500","3450180"," We teed off."
"3452480","3452880"," Right. "
"3453720","3455840"," So there's a couple of things you're looking for here."
"3456500","3460420"," You're looking for consolidation, another leg higher, believe it or not."
"3463300","3465640"," If we break, this is the usual stuff, right?"
"3466060","3470100"," We consolidate in this line and we should make another leg higher here. "
"3470540","3471420"," Markets are supportive."
"3472880","3481300"," If we come back down, you want to be looking for this blue line or this is where this is"
"3481300","3484520"," a roughly where the five minute big blue line is."
"3484520","3486040"," So there's a couple of places for you to make entry. "
"3486820","3488240"," One, two, and three."
"3488820","3490340"," You can DCA in there if you want."
"3492560","3496020"," You know that we have had this resistance above here. "
"3497140","3497880"," From yesterday."
"3506240","3508760"," We know we're going to get FOMO trades today, right?"
"3508920","3511100"," We know you're going to get FOMO's trying to jump on board."
"3521280","3526200"," They may also check that I usually check the options complex too and just to see where the dealers"
"3526200","3527380"," think we're going to go today. "
"3527380","3534140"," So right now you've got, you know, three to five C's or eighty nine cents, ninety cents, three to"
"3534140","3535560"," sixes or fifty cents."
"3537660","3542460"," You know, they're telling you that, yeah, we might get up here to three eighty six, but the reality"
"3542460","3545320"," is we might come back down retest and then make a plug higher."
"3545860","3548040"," Try to keep your eyes on options complex. "
"3548460","3558120"," They can sometimes be some crit some tea leaves into where the expected move"
"3558120","3560920"," is in the next five to fifteen minutes or so."
"3571680","3572340"," Where do they go?"
"3572480","3573560"," Where do they go for the gap bill?"
"3573700","3575280"," I think that they are going for the gap bill."
"3575500","3576320"," I think we're talking about the yesterday. "
"3576360","3580240"," He said you're going to see the attempt for the gap bill above."
"3580240","3584080"," I think it's that three ninety six and it'll probably fail."
"3585680","3586860"," And then we'll come back. "
"3587020","3588180"," That's what that's where the bears are waiting."
"3588980","3592580"," I heard some bears are waiting like right here."
"3592580","3593920"," This is where the bears are waiting. "
"3595640","3596860"," Like professional bears."
"3597940","3598640"," Now retailers."
"3600860","3603160"," That there were some professional bears waiting up here. "
"3607880","3610580"," But, you know, this is this is where it's at up here."
"3611740","3613020"," And that's where the gap is."
"3614020","3617280"," And there's another gap above it I believe right here. "
"3621280","3622360"," Let me see if I can."
"3624640","3627660"," Put this on a one hour chart here."
"3630200","3631780"," Yeah, there's another gap up here. "
"3632520","3633620"," It's not showing but."
"3634140","3634380"," Hold on."
"3635940","3638220"," Probably not showing because it only shows three gaps. "
"3639120","3641340"," But there's a gap above here."
"3643140","3644420"," Right here is a gap."
"3645220","3647000"," There's a gap right here 3D. "
"3647000","3651000"," The fair and great index forty nine hundred fifty two."
"3651140","3653240"," The crypto fair and great index three eighty eight."
"3653560","3654980"," So close this gap. "
"3655760","3657180"," And there's a gap right here."
"3657340","3659880"," It says the gap is above at four thousand but it's lower."
"3660080","3660800"," It starts like. "
"3662400","3664040"," Three ninety six forty five."
"3665160","3666520"," So there's a gap up here."
"3667020","3670240"," I don't know why it's not showing up here fully but there's a gap right there. "
"3672100","3674580"," There's two gaps one gap right here one gap right here."
"3674600","3676320"," So maybe we close the first gap right here."
"3686070","3688630"," So you can see that right here twenty three percent. "
"3689430","3692510"," And then the fifty percent retracement and sixty one."
"3692930","3697450"," So fifty percent retracement up here and this is the sixty one percent retracement right here."
"3697850","3699690"," So twenty three is like our three. "
"3700570","3701050"," Right."
"3701430","3701630"," So."
"3704630","3705890"," Come down to. "
"3709280","3711080"," And here's our three right here."
"3711240","3714220"," So maybe a attempted fail a failed attempt to a gap close."
"3714980","3716320"," You fail that one. "
"3718260","3723500"," And but this is the twenty three percent and then the two gaps above are I believe thirty eight"
"3723500","3723840"," fifty."
"3729830","3731750"," Just huge moves on spy right."
"3732490","3733590"," Huge reversal on spy. "
"3734810","3736170"," Monster reversal on spy."
"3770340","3771880"," Happy holidays to you."

"3877260","3880140"," We'll draw a little line in here just so we can see it on the one minute."
"3889390","3892450"," See if we can catch a bounce off this if we can even get down there. "
"3892550","3893650"," I don't know if we can get down here."
"3894090","3894930"," It'd be nice if we did."
"3895170","3896330"," It doesn't look like we are. "

"6585020","6591520"," one-hour chart on Tesla and you're gonna be looking for a coiling here and then a move higher on"
"6591520","6601160"," Tesla if you look at a 20 ma on Tesla on a one-hour you'll see the same look on"
"6601160","6607340"," a rip high I don't know when Tesla or if Sire could be today could be tomorrow but there should"
"6607340","6616220"," be a rip higher in Tesla you're trying to pound down nothing's changed on Tesla same same same move"

"6632720","6639000"," you can well we're gonna get a one-hour chart okay I make it's real simple so you see this"
"6639000","6647560"," blue line here right this is the 20 EMA and you can see this first red candle right you see"
"6647560","6653720"," this first red candle down here and you got a long red wick hair you've got bears trying to step"
"6653720","6658560"," it and tell you know we're going down we're going down we're going down right you know we hit 136"
"6658560","6664760"," eight or 135 80 so basically the 136 0 7 that we wanted to see robots came in tagged it"
"6664760","6670880"," in the open and now you're seeing this coiling here right and so you're like okay cap what are we"
"6670880","6675740"," doing here all right we're just gonna sit here all day long and not join in the party I'm gonna"
"6675740","6684020"," show you previously when we've had roll or it's right here I want to see this move higher here okay"
"6684020","6691160"," and what I'm gonna try to show you here is you see this slam right this is all computers right"
"6691160","6696220"," we know that algos we know that the bears and the bulls or algos we know that all all trading"

"6701460","6708280"," it's the same you know not the same but it looks the same right so you can see right here"
"6708280","6713340"," that compression right and you can see this cool what you'll say this is a fight between the bulls"
"6713340","6717600"," and the bears but the reality is this is all compressing in here right for a move higher in the"
"6717600","6724480"," end of blasting off here kind of coincides with Christmas right so one two three this is called a"
"6724480","6730160"," three-bar trade if you don't don't know what those are the three-bar trade three-bar bull trade one"
"6730160","6740060"," two three right and usually you're looking for a retracement trade right"
"6740060","6744400"," so we're down here in a retracement trade we're saying well how high is it gonna go we've got some"
"6744400","6749420"," shit to deal with here we've got to get above this one hour this is the same one right this"
"6749420","6754500"," is that one hour you're looking at if you really want to you can wait for the move higher on"
"6754500","6759280"," the one hour you can wait to enter the trade until we're above it but it's definitely shaping up"
"6759280","6767040"," like like a coiling for this explosive move higher and so the next question becomes where does it"
"6767040","6774460"," go cap and we give some price targets we've got this 150 above here we got the 159 above here"
"6774460","6784220"," and close this up 160 58 is the one that i'm really looking at here this is the 50"
"6784220","6792180"," retracement 168 here and so i'm expecting this i'm expecting some kind of explosive move higher so"
"6792180","6795740"," you got to hang tight if you're a tesla bullman you got to have patience if you're a tesla bull"
"6796300","6803020"," you're gonna lose money if you're a tesla bull that's what it's all about just kidding oh look at"

"6889060","6894060"," is positive gamma all this is all positive gamma but this is where we get like super bullish i"
"6894060","6896780"," don't think we're going to get super bullish think when we're rolling here somewhere we have some"
"6896780","6906700"," kind of a failure somewhere in here there's going to be a failure in here almost 100% sure you'll"

"7525250","7530690"," trading underneath the one minute ema though this is uh positive for the bears so you see this blue"
"7530690","7535810"," line that's going up this will be the first time today except for the open that we've traded under"
"7535810","7548380"," uh the one minute uh 21 ema so bears are starting to get a little bit of for"
"7548380","7555840"," a minute there i thought it was long calls and it wasn't uh so there this is productive for the"
"7555840","7564180"," bears right uh on a one minute time frame very productive for bears this is the this is the uh"
"7564180","7569320"," five minute time frame here right so on the one minute time frame we've got productivity for the"
"7569320","7577380"," bears trying to get down uh and see what happens down here we'll switch over briefly to the five"
"7577380","7582680"," minutes so you can see it so you can see the five minute right here we actually get some curl"
"7582680","7595260"," going on so we'll move this over because"
"7595260","7601580"," the five minute chart bears very productive right now trying to get down on this five minute ema"

"7670920","7680680"," in uh 21 day uh exponential exponential moving average and on the five minute chart so his point is"
"7680680","7684420"," is, I'll show you here, get rid of this."
"7684940","7691280"," His point is that if you're trading, if we're above the, I'm gonna make this short and sweet."
"7691860","7696480"," If we're above the 21-day EMA, it's bullish, right?"
"7697360","7701440"," So you take the bullish trade above the 21 EMA. "
"7703620","7710340"," If we, let's say here we had slipped below, let's say you took the bullish trade here, right?"
"7711700","7713400"," And the trade actually went against you."
"7713880","7720260"," You'd stay in the bullish trade, then pick up the bearish trade, make your money down here, and"
"7720260","7725180"," then exit the bullish trade once it, once it recovered back on the 21 EMA."
"7726220","7727960"," So it's a two-sided trade. "
"7729740","7732720"," So right here, this is where it is right now, right?"
"7732860","7735900"," You're gonna be, if you're a bull, you're looking to pick this trade back up right here."
"7736860","7739900"," You set your stop losses right here if you wanted to."
"7740420","7745000"," If we started to break below this trade, you'd pick up the bear trade, but it's a two-sided trade,"
"7745220","7746660"," and it has an edge. "
"7747420","7752520"," The trade has, the trade has an edge, small edge, but it's like a 30% edge or something like"
"7752520","7752680"," that."
"7752800","7753680"," There's a white paper on it."
"7755000","7763260"," We've posted it before, maybe some of you guys, if you have that link to it, maybe you guys can"
"7763260","7764000"," post it in the chat. "
"7765060","7766760"," Make sure you follow him on Twitter."
"7767680","7772860"," He's someone I've been following since my, when I first came on Twitter, he's a, I have a lot of"
"7772860","7773500"," trust for him."
"7774760","7776740"," He's an old school market maker, a pit trader. "
"7778460","7785100"," His, his, his pick card was, I think it was JM77."
"7786020","7787580"," If I have that right, it could be wrong on that."
"7794980","7797300"," So I'm gonna go back, so this is a one-minute chart, right?"
"7797540","7798860"," So I'm gonna go back to the five-minute chart. "
"7799340","7807680"," I'm trying to trade the one-minute, so what I'll end up doing is I'll place and update this every,"
"7807860","7814120"," every 15 minutes, half hour or so, but I'll put, where I think the five-minute EMA is."
"7814780","7818940"," I'm sure there's a way to get this on the one-minute, but just for now, for you guys, it's"
"7818940","7819540"," sitting here, right?"
"7819780","7823900"," And I'm gonna switch back to the one-minute, and I can see it just sitting here."
"7824720","7826560"," So I'm gonna make a five-minute or one-minute trade. "
"7827080","7828980"," I know I'm below the one-minute down here."
"7829060","7831200"," I wanna see some kind of interaction down here."
"7832300","7834520"," Yeah, see if I can trade this, pick this back up. "
"7837230","7840070"," Make a quick 20, 30, 40%, 100% trade."
"7842330","7848050"," I'm gonna be watching BookMap to see if it's supportive, the dome and the order flow, right?"
"7855360","7865660"," And just heads up to on the, on the cumulative on BookMap, we"
"7865660","7866880"," are plateauing a little bit."
"7866880","7869700"," We could see the selling of calls and buying of puts here. "
"7870360","7875800"," So just notice that the cumulative, see the graph down at the bottom, left-hand side of your"
"7875800","7876040"," screen."
"7876700","7878340"," There's some plateauing going on."
"7885950","7887730"," I'm going to see this right here, okay?"
"7888250","7889570"," Hold on, I'm gonna switch over right now. "
"7892110","7895230"," We're sitting here, mute this, hold on a second."
"7896210","7906080"," Okay, so I just want you to see, a little bit of plateauing going on up here, okay?"
"7906380","7907480"," So I just want you to see this."
"7907480","7908380"," This could be indicative. "
"7909480","7911540"," Now the heroin indicator will show you this as well."
"7911820","7917220"," And this looks a little indicative of consolidation, maybe selling calls, buying of puts."
"7918020","7923060"," It's just be conscious of this plateau, you know, range-wise, we're at the top of a range, right?"
"7923660","7925880"," We're stretching higher on an intraday. "
"7927860","7929480"," Still have more buyers and sellers."
"7930520","7932220"," Plus we could still be in consolidation here."
"7938000","7939780"," Just a second second switch back over here. "
"7967730","7977290"," Oh, no, if the Tesla coil, I would not be surprised to see it be range-bound between one,"
"7982170","7986510"," 141-26 in that 136-07 range."
"7988470","7989950"," And then see an explosive move higher."
"7990110","7993350"," You can always combat this by taking a call spread too. "
"7994790","8002290"," You can take a call spread on Tesla for a week out and then buy some fire outside the money"
"8002290","8002590"," puts."
"8004070","8007830"," He like 20 cent puts on Tesla down to like $96."
"8009170","8010450"," There's your trade right there. "
"8010590","8011850"," It's very simple, very straightforward."
"8014360","8020580"," If you break out above 141-46, you know you can cut the put side of your call spread and"
"8020580","8024800"," you know you can cut the, you can just burn the 20 cents or whatever on the puts."
"8026200","8030880"," If you guys are taking a directional trade on Tesla, pretty standard thing. "
"8037060","8042040"," Tony Cheese is like, I'm driving the Millennium Falcon today cap, balls deep, baby."
"8043260","8045200"," Be careful of trap buyers up here."
"8045380","8047040"," So you might have a bull that's up here, right?"
"8048100","8051840"," You'll see a move higher and then it'll fail and come back down. "
"8052940","8056320"," So you've got these buyers here hoping that we go higher, we don't, right?"
"8056460","8057060"," They trap them in."
"8058560","8062040"," Bulls will end up taking like 70% of what it will."
"8062040","8064140"," Let's say we're at a dollar here and now it's at 70 cents. "
"8064520","8065000"," Just an example."
"8065760","8067760"," And then they'll drop it right back down over here."
"8084520","8084940"," Yeah. "
"8086180","8090500"," You know, Tesla's, it has all the signs of this being a bottom."
"8090840","8093360"," And it says it's a bottom and it should coil."
"8094200","8096260"," It should take anywhere from one to three days. "
"8097780","8099900"," But it'll, it should make an explosive move."
"8102740","8104520"," And then the other thing about Tesla would be this."
"8104760","8106680"," So let me bring up Tesla real quick for you. "
"8107360","8111440"," So what you do is this would be the trade plan for Tesla."
"8111720","8111840"," Okay."
"8114200","8118640"," So let me mute this for you. "
"8118700","8123880"," So if you wanted to enter, let's say a Tesla trade, I got an options trade, hold on a second"
"8123880","8124040"," here."
"8129930","8131990"," So you see this range here, right?"
"8131990","8132070"," Okay."
"8139360","8147570"," So anywhere here at a low, you're going to be looking to pick up a call spread, right?"
"8148830","8152930"," And then you buy some dirt cheap puts on Tesla. "
"8153830","8159760"," And we'll look at the, I'll give you an exact number if you want it."
"8159820","8160000"," Okay."
"8160840","8166100"," So you have panicking for, for just protection, right?"
"8167300","8176880"," So you do like a weekly zero day to the next expiry, zero dates down to 123. "
"8178200","8178720"," Right."
"8178860","8179640"," So 123 P."
"8187640","8189260"," I'll set this trade up for you."
"8190620","8192500"," For how I would set this trade up. "
"8194379","8203950"," So yeah, perfect."
"8206370","8215610"," So like 125, 125 P for the 23rd is 27 cents."
"8216450","8217209"," So let's just go. "
"8217309","8218830"," Let's just go with December 30th."
"8220990","8229469"," And a 110, I don't think you'd get there, but like a one, a 125 P on the 30th is"
"8229469","8230750"," $1.53, right?"
"8231010","8232510"," So I'd probably do the 23rd."
"8233250","8240830"," Um, something dirt cheap, like maybe 126, 126 P that's our, that's S three on Tesla. "
"8241530","8247830"," So I do like a 20 cent put down here just in case it rolls, in case this breaks the"
"8247830","8256629"," other way to protect the trade, then I would put in a, uh, a call spread expiring either on the"
"8256629","8257770"," 23rd of the 30th."
"8258450","8263389"," I would, I would do the call spread in the money up to, uh, one, what did I say?"
"8263389","8264450"," The top is 169."
"8264629","8270270"," So you could just do an in the money call spread between 136 and 141. "
"8271049","8271850"," You could do it a little bit higher."
"8271870","8277910"," You could go used to get a 23% retracement here of 150."
"8278670","8281230"," So 149 you could do right where you are. "
"8281410","8283730"," 138 to 149 C call spread."
"8284610","8293170"," Some dirt cheap, uh, dirt cheap, uh, insurance on it for 20 cents, 30 cents, somewhere in there."
"8293610","8298610"," And the expectation is going to be that on an hourly chart, this is the one hour chart, right?"
"8299889","8304469"," The expectation is going to be that at some point we're going to have an explosive move higher, uh,"
"8304610","8307850"," into the 30th right here, right over there. "
"8308770","8310170"," So we're going to expose the move higher."
"8310330","8312290"," And all I needed to do is get above right here."
"8313730","8315990"," Makes sense if the trade goes against you, you've got insurance. "
"8316690","8318530"," If the trade goes against you, you'd also cut it."
"8318549","8321170"," You'd also cut the call side of that spread, right?"
"8321430","8324770"," And just, and then maybe just start adding more puts on tests on Tesla."
"8325469","8329129"," Now, if you're like, well, I want to be even more conservative than that cap, then here you go. "
"8329430","8336330"," You wait for the one hour 20 EMA to prove itself, right?"
"8336590","8340990"," And you pick the trade up right here on the hourly on Tesla."
"8341490","8342030"," Does that make sense?"
"8342910","8345850"," This is the one where you throw risk on, you know, you're above it."
"8346270","8348889"," There's some spots here where they could throw it, throw it back at you. "
"8349930","8353510"," But if you want that cheap, nice, cheap trade, and if you look at that, see where they throw it"
"8353510","8359670"," above here and they hammer you, you're only looking for this trade to print to right here."
"8360670","8364690"," So there's a high likelihood that you're going to get what you're looking for out of this trade"
"8364690","8366170"," that I gave you originally."
"8366830","8368809"," If you guys pause this program, go back and look at it. "
"8369469","8371010"," The trade that I just set up for you."
"8372290","8373930"," I think this is bottom, man."
"8374530","8376190"," This is your double bottom right here. "
"8378889","8380049"," And there it is right there."
"8382879","8388140"," Tesla, we need more, we need, you need a retracement here to get more selling on Tesla if you want."
"8388440","8393880"," If you're bearish, you don't want to be, you don't, this, your thesis, your thesis shorting Tesla"
"8394400","8399800"," shouldn't be, your thesis shorting Tesla shouldn't be. "
"8409580","8412500"," We're going to, you can see that move right there, right?"
"8412720","8414240"," You can see that move right there, right?"
"8414660","8418840"," Your thesis on Tesla shouldn't be, yeah, fuck it, I'm going to enter short right now."
"8419960","8421080"," Does that make sense?"
"8421620","8424800"," Because if you do that, I can show you what happens is that we get a retracement."
"8425640","8428980"," And I already measured this against previous down moves. "
"8429260","8432260"," This is, this is way, way, way stretched here."
"8433360","8436980"," So your thesis would be that you have some kind of retracement."
"8438940","8442200"," You're going to look for them to tee off at some point up here, make sense?"
"8443840","8447720"," And then if you want to be a bear, I would be like, yeah, anything up here, I'm willing to"
"8447720","8448760"," short this down, no problem. "
"8449740","8450160"," Make sense?"
"8450780","8455540"," It's just, you have to take risk out of this market and there's, there's a trade in there, right?"
"8455880","8458420"," If you wanted to be short, this is the meat of the trade."
"8459700","8463560"," Most bears are, most computers aren't like, yeah, we're just going to fucking keep doing this."
"8465860","8469660"," So just as a thesis, right?"
"8471400","8477080"," And let's say your thesis is wrong, you know where to cut your, your lungs, right?"
"8477400","8478240"," You know it's down here. "
"8478740","8482040"," So you should be always doing some kind of nonsense like this, right?"
"8482540","8486960"," So you have high probability of that trade printing for you."
"8487740","8489260"," Can things go wrong against you?"
"8489660","8489740"," Yes."
"8492640","8499200"," But like if we were up here and you're telling me, you know, we just went from 167 to 198"
"8499200","8502120"," and you're like, hey, Cap, I'm going to go buy some calls here. "
"8502140","8502720"," We're going to 250."
"8503040","8506120"," I'd be like, you know, like it's kind of a risky trade up there."
"8506780","8509500"," You know, trend is down and we just retraced. "
"8510240","8513640"," And now you're telling me, this is like when bulls tell me they're going to take a trade right"
"8513640","8516520"," here, I'm like, I don't know, it's getting kind of toppy here."
"8517140","8519580"," And this is, I don't know, it's getting kind of bottomy here."
"8519740","8520020"," Make sense?"
"8524420","8526880"," And you know, you're going to take risk in this market no matter what. "
"8527040","8528340"," You know, there's nothing that I can say."
"8528580","8530440"," You know, there's nothing that anyone else can say to you."
"8533100","8535920"," Like that can be, you know, like it's guaranteed it's going to work. "
"8536220","8540420"," But you know, if I'm telling you, this is probably the, if you were to tell me, if you're, if"
"8540420","8544360"," you and I were standing in a room and you told me, the trade is down from here in Tesla."
"8545460","8550440"," I would guarantee that if we traded that nine times or 10 times, I guarantee I'd smoke you."
"8551220","8553740"," It's smokey, it's smokey, it's smokey every time. "
"8554700","8556420"," It's smokey every single time here."
"8557620","8562440"," I'd beat you, I'd probably beat you nine, seven to nine times out of that trade."
"8562640","8563660"," I know I'd beat you on that trade. "
"8566070","8566810"," Know I would."
"8569420","8570720"," 100% I know I would."
"8573390","8575010"," This trade's probably a week long trade. "
"8575350","8581190"," So look for a nice little place to buy a bottom down here and take that trade higher."
"8581190","8583750"," I know I would."
"8584050","8590670"," I'm 100% I'm 100% positively sure that I'd beat you on that trade nine times out of 10. "
"8590790","8592950"," Even in even the worst bear market ever known in history."
"8605430","8608410"," I don't care if we, I don't care if we, I don't care if we crash today."
"8609110","8613450"," 20% you probably back that next day to where you were. "
"8619550","8622590"," I also, I also know this is a bunch of shit here."
"8622590","8629270"," So like if it, if it crashed today 20%, you'd probably get a, a retrace within two days."
"8630110","8633250"," Uh oh, you guys are, any guys trade the crash in 2020?"
"8633850","8635710"," I think most of the money is made on the retraces. "
"8637270","8640350"," Now you're like sitting in positions for long, long, long periods of time."
"8640510","8641070"," They got too expensive."
"8641390","8642710"," If you got out, you couldn't get back in. "
"8643630","8647150"," You have like contracts or like 20, 30,000 dollars a contract."
"8652310","8657250"," So, anyways, my point that I'm trying to make to you is you have a place to cut long on"
"8657250","8657490"," Tesla."
"8657810","8662710"," If it goes below, you have a place to enter a range to enter on a bottom on Tesla. "
"8664190","8665430"," I'm going to call a spread."
"8666190","8669610"," You're probably going to take two or three days to get it to move higher."
"8670330","8671230"," So you have to have patience. "
"8671830","8673530"," Can't be on, can't be on social media."
"8673710","8674650"," Listen to people talk to you."
"8675310","8679090"," I'm telling you that Tesla's going to go to zero tomorrow, stuff like that. "
"8681790","8684670"," So if you want that long Tesla trade, that's where it is."
"8684830","8686330"," You know where to cut your losses on it, right?"
"8687070","8693850"," You know, anywhere below that 160, uh, or 136, 07 is your, your stop loss."
"8694270","8695830"," You're already in puts on the call spread. "
"8696070","8699630"," So you're already making money on the put side of it."
"8699630","8706970"," And you've got your parachute, uh, 20 cent puts that if we start, if it starts getting ugly and we"
"8706970","8712290"," have a market crash, your 20 cent puts are probably going to go to like, I don't know, 20 bucks"
"8712290","8713250"," or something stupid."
"8716150","8717990"," So I don't know what else to say about that. "
"8731290","8734330"," What I was at the right because I'm because I've been wrong so many times."
"8735610","8739770"," Because I've made stupid trade, stupid trade so many times I've lost so much money."
"8743470","8751590"," I've made so many bad decisions that I try to protect my trades and make sure they have a very"
"8751590","8754190"," high probability of printing. "
"8764060","8765940"," Yeah, there's no real, there's no way to lose that."
"8766040","8770040"," I don't think there's a way to lose that trade to be very, maybe a sideways move into end of"
"8770040","8771360"," year would lose, you'd lose that trade."
"8772920","8774540"," But even then you only need it. "
"8774640","8779000"," You'll need time to pass on that call spread and to get above the current trading range."
"8779400","8779980"," That's all you need."
"8780180","8782640"," Time to pass, get above the current trading range. "
"8782860","8783140"," That's it."
"8784420","8785440"," That's what that trade is."
"8789760","8790440"," Does it make sense?"
"8790440","8795380"," So your trade, as long as you get above that R1, you get that 149 or whatever it is, 148. "
"8796520","8800960"," As long as you're above there at some point in days or passing, that call spread is going to print"
"8800960","8801460"," for you."
"8809720","8816860"," And I most certainly would not, would never take a butterfly and spy rate or a tussle right now."
"8817080","8818880"," Too much risk of an upside explosive move. "
"8820580","8821360"," Too much risk."
"8822080","8824700"," I doubt tussle trade sideways into the 30th."
"8825940","8827000"," We'll track that trade. "
"8827640","8828780"," You guys want to track that trade?"
"8829620","8832300"," You guys want to paper trade it and see if it prints or not?"
"8832760","8833540"," Just paper trade it."
"8835620","8836460"," And see if it prints."
"8838720","8843500"," It has a pretty high probability of printing no matter which direction we go. "
"8851220","8852900"," Let's take a look at the five-minute chart."
"8864850","8866050"," A little bounce here."
"8867330","8871890"," We're always trying to hold on here to the 20, 21 EMA of the five-minute. "
"8879010","8880190"," Yeah, I've lost so much money."
"8880550","8882910"," You guys have no idea how many bad trades I've made."
"8884450","8888330"," So one of the best ways you can learn how to trade spreads is by staying in them almost to"
"8888330","8889410"," the bitter end when you're losing. "
"8890230","8892690"," And you'd be like, oh, now I know how to, I know how to function now."
"8893630","8898590"," You can read about it, but when you're in a bad trade, you can, you can real, real fast, you'll"
"8898590","8907740"," figure out here, stop, lost the prayer, dug him."
"8910580","8913660"," Yeah, you can wait to take that trade too. "
"8913740","8916700"," This isn't like something where whatever your risk profile is."
"8916700","8920100"," If you're like, hey, I want to see a move above the one hour."
"8920380","8923680"," Dude, I understand that trade 100% wanting to wait until you're above it. "
"8924420","8925360"," Completely understand it."
"8926320","8931020"," If you want some confirmation that we're going to trend change on Tesla, you don't have to take"
"8931020","8932260"," that trade right now at this moment."
"8934280","8935620"," You have to manage your own risk. "
"8936060","8937800"," You have to decide if you're going down."
"8938720","8943940"," I just think looking at Tesla right where it is right now, the probability is for an upside move."
"8945300","8946200"," It's a high probability. "
"8965390","8967350"," Here's our two and our one."
"8983260","8984300"," Let's see here."
"8985820","8989940"," We got the first top here on our three. "
"8990620","8998990"," If we were to have a pullback here on spy, sorry, started here, right?"
"9001550","9008750"," $3,364, $3,383 or $0.17 on puts right now."
"9014090","9020730"," $3.85 or $0.54. We have a high probability of coming into R2."
"9040210","9042350"," I want to see if this holds right now. "
"9046550","9051070"," Dealers have a $3.35 p at $0.50 for right here."
"9056450","9058630"," I'd like to see a pullback to R2 if we can get it."
"9059250","9061950"," Then come right back to VWAP and be happy. "
"9069750","9071670"," I think I'm looking for VWAP down here."
"9071910","9074010"," Chase at $3.85 right down here, brother."
"9075230","9078130"," I want to see this nice R2 and then maybe another. "
"9078450","9079170"," I don't know if we'll get it."
"9080370","9081770"," Maybe we trade sideways here."
"9082050","9083810"," I'd like to see at least the cool enough. "
"9085630","9091540"," I'd like to see a move down here, maybe something like that, then I move higher."
"9093700","9095960"," I wouldn't even care if we came down here today."
"9097140","9098820"," We have two more days left, right?"
"9103720","9108600"," Yeah, so price started down below $3.85. They're $0.50. There's some really cheap ones. "
"9108860","9117040"," There's $3.33 is at $0.19, but I don't know if they're saying that's a hard one."
"9128110","9130130"," I'm going to drop what you guys want to get bearish here."
"9131030","9133070"," Blood blood here. "
"9133290","9136610"," Intel breaks up graphics chip unit to speed up effort."
"9137830","9142270"," Break below the big blue line."
"9145210","9146910"," There's a big blue line right there. "
"9157200","9158300"," Look at that, beautiful."
"9159160","9162300"," When you look at that right there in the five minute."
"9165660","9167440"," You guys want to make a red?"
"9170280","9171780"," You guys are going to thicken it up for you. "
"9173040","9174620"," You're going to do that right there."
"9174980","9175740"," Is that what you're going to do?"
"9182870","9184230"," Should we give a little bit of a..."
"9185090","9186710"," Let's see if the bear is a little bit at all."
"9189370","9191010"," Is that what the bear is looking for right there?"
"9193350","9196550"," Is that what the bear is looking for right there?"
"9196910","9197430"," Is that what they want?"
"9199310","9200470"," Is that what the bear wants?"
"9201030","9202130"," Just bring it on down. "
"9206550","9207630"," Oh, no, we want that red."
"9214060","9215020"," What else we got here?"
"9215140","9215800"," Oh, yeah."
"9224470","9225850"," You guys know how this goes, right?"
"9230330","9231430"," You guys want to make it nasty?"
"9232950","9234370"," You guys want to make it nasty?"
"9239240","9240200"," Hold on there. "
"9243560","9247420"," Hold on, I got some bears."
"9252540","9253880"," Is that the cross or death?"
"9262810","9266570"," No, no, no, no."
"9266570","9267130"," No. "
"9267130","9271870"," So, no, we don't want that, do we?"
"9274310","9275150"," Who wants that?"
"9275510","9276390"," Does the bears want that?"
"9276570","9278530"," I should get like a graphic that's like a cross."
"9284260","9286800"," We'll just need to pull it out of their ass right here to stay on trend."
"9292020","9293920"," Or else we're getting, we're getting blood. "
"9297520","9299340"," You know, are we seeing anything like this, do you?"
"9299620","9300820"," Like, come back up here."
"9301240","9302800"," You want to see that kind of a thing into the clothes?"
"9303920","9305520"," You want to see that, do you?"
"9309260","9310600"," Then the evil, wouldn't it?"
"9313380","9314200"," Right there."
"9316620","9318680"," You're watching this right here to tee off. "
"9319640","9322260"," Come back down, try to capture that and then blood."
"9323780","9325120"," That'd be nasty, wouldn't it?"
"9328420","9329340"," Then the evil."
"9333200","9335100"," We're in the dance club right now for the bears. "
"9356980","9358860"," The bears are getting saucy now."
"9360100","9361680"," The bears got it set up."
"9363840","9365300"," We're in a changed hair to the blue. "
"9366820","9368060"," We're going to start with blue."
"9370620","9394520"," Do, do, do,"
"9394700","9395420"," do, do, do."
"9409580","9411620"," Let's change this to a green line here. "
"9416840","9418400"," This is what the bulls need to get above."
"9418920","9422360"," The bulls need to get above that green line right there."
"9426780","9429810"," The bulls need to save it. "
"9431410","9434010"," This is the don't diddle line right here."
"9434450","9435390"," You want to be diddling here?"
"9438630","9440790"," This is like the indecision kind of a place here."
"9440790","9444750"," This is when you, when, when you hear, I think Brian Watts talked about not diddling the middle. "
"9444950","9447690"," This is one of those places, you know, diddling there."
"9448810","9450470"," You can break up here easily."
"9451250","9454490"," You want confirmation if you're a bull to go up higher here. "
"9455030","9458610"," So if you're on a, let's say you're just out there doing your thing."
"9463860","9465120"," Right here, let's see."
"9467740","9468740"," That works right there. "
"9468900","9472380"," Okay, so like right here, you don't want to be diddling in here."
"9473200","9477760"," Because if there's a move higher, this is where you would want to take a long call."
"9478460","9480440"," Anything below here is, is evil. "
"9480880","9482480"," Like this, we start breaking down over here."
"9484820","9486740"," Always in this, this, this area here."
"9487000","9489520"," You can actually do a, a straddle here too. "
"9490520","9492420"," Cut one side loose if you don't want to pick a, pick a direction."
"9493560","9494420"," Pick an OTM call above."
"9495400","9496300"," Pick an OTM put below. "
"9498660","9500500"," We'll take a, I'll take a look around the market right now."
"9501000","9501920"," See where we're actually at."
"9506270","9508010"," Yeah, I missed the ends of a fucking G."
"9508290","9509490"," I like to make fun of them on Twitter. "
"9510630","9511370"," But I like them."
"9511930","9512290"," I always have."
"9518000","9520900"," The guys out there trading every day puts on, on YouTube. "
"9521580","9522760"," You got no, no beef with that guy."
"9524100","9524820"," None zero."
"9526100","9527680"," You have people on Twitter all the time. "
"9529160","9531820"," Uh, trolling, but you don't know what they're actually doing in real life."
"9532760","9537180"," My fuckers could just be angry at life and, uh, or collecting fees or whatever the fuck it is"
"9537180","9537540"," they're doing."
"9540320","9542220"," And you got Mr. Ian out there just doing his thing. "
"9542500","9545860"," So, yeah, I don't care if you're, I don't care if you're a bull or bear or whatever."
"9546060","9549520"," If you're out there doing your thing every day, I have mad respect for you."
"9549580","9552160"," If you're out there putting yourself out there, you're on Twitter or something. "
"9552320","9554280"," You like him long here or I'm short there."
"9554940","9556460"," I don't even care if the trade goes against you."
"9556800","9557320"," In fact, you're doing it. "
"9559420","9560100"," Power to you."
"9562720","9563560"," It's not, it's not easy."
"9564400","9569440"," Um, let's take a look around the market real quick or I'm going to look, we look around the"
"9569440","9571100"," backside of the market here and another screener. "
"9572320","9572980"," Hold on here."
"9575540","9578140"," I just just want to take a look around and see what's going on."
"9578500","9579720"," I'm going to check Dixie right now. "
"9590040","9595340"," The pound falls zero spot nine percent to one spot two zero seven three the lowest level since"
"9595340","9596320"," December the first."
"9597640","9599680"," Uh, Dixie's shown a little bit of support here."
"9599680","9603540"," You know, a lot of buyers down below in that coil and kind of a thing on Dixie right now. "
"9603800","9605360"," I'm on a five minute turn and Dixie."
"9607640","9609240"," And what the fuck is that?"
"9610000","9610260"," Okay."
"9611580","9612860"," This could break either way. "
"9613220","9614920"," Like Dixie could break up or down right here."
"9616460","9617960"," We look at a larger timeframe."
"9620720","9625480"," Last time we broke below, but you know, we're on trend here to go down. "
"9626180","9629460"," Uh, to keep selling Dixie."
"9629940","9632160"," There's some decoupling in Dixie right now."
"9632520","9633420"," There's a previous high. "
"9633540","9634960"," It could be looking for though on the bare side."
"9635760","9637120"," Dixie's not really telling me much."
"9637420","9639140"," Let's see if we can see any divergences out there. "
"9639180","9640100"," We're going to look at HYG."
"9640940","9643040"," I'm not showing you guys HYG, but I'm looking."
"9644060","9646960"," I'm not showing you this on chart right now, but in the background, I'm doing it. "
"9646960","9647920"," You should be doing the same thing."
"9649340","9651540"," Uh, HYG is bullish trying to reclaim trend."
"9651540","9655480"," Uh, yeah. "
"9655860","9657740"," HYG is still trying to reclaim trend here."
"9660860","9662080"," Let me check J and K."
"9664400","9667620"," Same thing with the J, J, Y, K, J and K, excuse me."
"9669420","9674900"," Still blows context overall on J and K trying to read just state, try to get back into trend. "
"9676040","9677040"," Let's check out the VIX."
"9677040","9682380"," Uh, we got the, what's going, I didn't check VIX today."
"9684280","9686040"," VIX at 31.65 elevated. "
"9687700","9690860"," Uh, there's a, uh, Volmageddon coming up on VIX."
"9691440","9693340"," Some people calling for VIX to go to 100."
"9701000","9702520"," Uh, I get the wrong ticker here. "
"9705800","9707520"," VIX now down below it."
"9707760","9709060"," Uh, let's take a VIX real quick."
"9709060","9710760"," Yeah, VIX is at 1994. "
"9711840","9721630"," Uh, we've seen VIX get, get bought in the past down, uh, 1880."
"9726280","9731240"," 18.95. So Vol's been really, really selling off here, right?"
"9737660","9738880"," Check VIX real quick again."
"9739380","9744100"," A lot of being patted on, uh, VIX 1994 looks like they're trying to rebuy that back up and send"
"9744100","9744620"," it up higher. "
"9748770","9750170"," It's all looks legit here."
"9750450","9751790"," Let's take a look here at 1213."
"9753510","9754630"," Uh, hold on here. "
"9757320","9758800"," Yeah, VIX can go down again."
"9759200","9760580"," There's no reason why VIX can't go down here."
"9761360","9763440"," No reason why VIX can't go down. "
"9768910","9770150"," 1213 we sold off."
"9771130","9771570"," Keep around."
"9772090","9775190"," Could get a cell signal at a close on spy. "
"9776390","9778690"," I don't know when that is if that's on Friday."
"9779890","9786290"," Uh, if that's today, but, uh, be conscious of, look at spy on the 13th of December and the VIX"
"9786290","9790450"," on the 13th of December and 12th do a comparison chart on that one."
"9794130","9796270"," And then, uh, what else we're looking for here?"
"9796790","9797150"," Not shy. "
"9801050","9801930"," TLT XLF."
"9802070","9806910"," I'm going to take a quick peek at XLF looks like it wants to, wants to consolidate a little bit"
"9806910","9807150"," more."
"9809410","9810670"," XLF can come down a little bit. "
"9812010","9813590"," Take a look at XLF real quick."
"9814250","9815370"," Let me bring this back down here."
"9818410","9820250"," Uh, XLF. "
"9824270","9828630"," You know, XLF's got some gaps to fill down here and could consolidate."
"9828710","9830790"," You could see some intraday weakness on the spy."
"9831810","9832210"," So. "
"9836640","9837860"," XLF's kind of telling you."
"9840280","9847540"," Yeah, you want to see some kind of started trade below down here, teed off down here, teed off down"
"9847540","9850760"," here, got a gap to fill down below on XLF."
"9851680","9857300"," You know, if it stays above the big blue line, you go higher, but it's, you know, it's kind of"
"9857300","9860160"," due for, you know, some kind of consolidation here. "
"9863930","9868090"," Um, J and K."
"9868470","9870470"," I don't, I've got different instances of this stuff."
"9872190","9876210"," No, so I don't, I'm like, I'm looking at this from a different perspective, from a different"
"9876210","9877230"," perspective somewhere else."
"9878570","9882710"," And, you know, J and K is not, I think I got to fill down here on J and K."
"9882850","9885710"," You could have some intraday weakness, maybe, and then an attempt higher. "
"9886950","9889090"," That shows you a Friday, I guess, here."
"9889510","9893090"," And then Vix is kind of showing you some kind of a bloodbath coming up at some point."
"9894450","9900820"," Uh, yeah, so. "
"9904930","9911410"," Maybe some intraday weakness on the spy and then if you get, if you get, um."
"9912750","9916790"," See, we are, I think right now you're looking for some kind of weakness and spy intraday."
"9917610","9921810"," Could get something like this in the tomorrow, but then I would expect some kind of a blast up by"
"9921810","9923910"," Friday and then maybe Monday we sell it off. "
"9925150","9929590"," By Monday, if you're wrong on that, but that's what that's what the, um."
"9931850","9933210"," That's what the markets saying."
"9933470","9937870"," If you think I'm wrong on that, uh, let me know in the chat. "
"9941330","9942050"," Just consolidation."
"9942670","9944270"," I don't know if this is true distribution."
"9948190","9949830"," Like we're going to depths of hell kind of stuff. "
"9951150","9955910"," As I just hear in comments from Ukraine's agriculture ministers, there's 2022 corn harvest seen"
"9955910","9961770"," falling 22 to 23 million tons from 41 spot 9 million tons in 2021."
"9962010","9968130"," This is a 2022 to 23 wheat exportable surplus seen at 16 spot 3 million tons."
"9968950","9974590"," At the same time frame with a grain exportable surplus seen at 49 spot 2 million tons and coming"
"9974590","9976190"," from Ukraine's agriculture minister. "
"9976770","9978710"," As we'll keep this five minute chart up here."
"9979550","9980510"," Some intraday weakness."
"9981490","9984990"," If you want to be we're below that we're below sort of five minute. "
"9985850","9987770"," Sorry, I'm getting the 25 minute here."
"9990900","9998610"," So we are below the five minute on the EMA right here, right?"
"9998770","10000130"," So just be where we're here."
"10000230","10001550"," You've got the first cell down here. "
"10002850","10007190"," Trapped some bulls and we're going to have some price targets down below three to five."
"10008790","10010850"," And possibly even 20 day low."
"10011110","10013030"," I lost down around the entire move. "
"10013250","10015690"," One percent down here somewhere."
"10019680","10022100"," I think this would send XLF back as well."
"10028010","10029530"," So keep that up right there. "
"10029790","10031050"," I'll leave on the five minute chart minute."
"10031050","10040210"," XLF you're probably looking for 33 34 flat."
"10040390","10040750"," How about that?"
"10042550","10043930"," No 34 sorry. "
"10046460","10047600"," Just a second here."
"10059250","10060710"," Just a second here."
"10062050","10066670"," Keep an eye on XLF at like 33 to. "
"10068250","10069930"," Somewhere in there at 33 to."
"10079690","10082130"," On the closing bell would be 33 89."
"10086640","10087440"," On XLF. "
"10088020","10089040"," See if you can get down below."
"10089240","10091040"," It's still on Vwap right now."
"10091180","10091300"," So. "
"10092700","10093960"," Sitting on Vwap right now."
"10097320","10099220"," And XLF looks like they bought Vwap."
"10099400","10100240"," So we'll see what happens here. "
"10101660","10102340"," Not really."
"10102520","10106080"," I'm not really impressed either way right now on spy."
"10107140","10108140"," It's that same area. "
"10108320","10109680"," It's sitting right here."
"10110640","10111620"," And I just don't like."
"10111920","10114100"," I don't ever like trading in here. "
"10116340","10118840"," I don't ever like this move here."
"10118980","10119840"," It could break either way."
"10121500","10122820"," So I am flat right now. "
"10123140","10124100"," Let's see what happens in here."
"10130400","10131140"," Yeah, Chase."
"10133380","10134600"," I feel you, Chase. "
"10136140","10138200"," So you guys are saying Yahoo is always bearish."
"10138200","10139140"," Showings by Apollo group."
"10139160","10141440"," Actual Danny think that's a fade. "
"10141540","10142520"," Usually try and fade main."
"10143200","10145700"," Stream media was Yahoo bullish or bearish."
"10146080","10148120"," And past there is some correlation leak. "
"10148860","10150900"," Pick gains and dump around of expiration or vice versa."
"10151240","10151360"," Yep."
"10152080","10152860"," Yeah, there's some. "
"10153380","10154740"," There's a guy on Twitter that I trust."
"10155620","10156880"," A VIX guy that I trust."
"10157180","10157660"," Not always. "
"10158300","10159220"," He said VIX would dump."
"10159660","10160080"," Always."
"10160440","10162320"," I think said VIX would dump into VIXpiration. "
"10162840","10164520"," But there's another guy that I trust that said."
"10165800","10166780"," Volmageddon is coming up."
"10166860","10168120"," We should hit 100 on VIX. "
"10192730","10193810"," I'm still trading with it."
"10193910","10194950"," It's range on Tesla though."
"10195070","10200650"," Tesla's got that range of 136 and 136.08 or whatever. "
"10201270","10203490"," 138 or 135.80 still within range."
"10213380","10215480"," What's going on with so Robert saying."
"10219020","10220640"," I'm seeing something shut right now. "
"10220800","10221100"," Can you get."
"10221380","10223360"," I don't know what I haven't read the chat fully yet."
"10224700","10225440"," How about this?"
"10225760","10227040"," Can I ask you guys to just. "
"10228940","10230360"," It's the holiday season just."
"10231140","10232180"," Easy real quick."
"10233220","10234960"," And just try to get along for a moment. "
"10236040","10237300"," I haven't seen what was said."
"10239640","10243280"," What's the so there's someone's Robert what's going on with Robert."
"10244500","10245160"," You're right bro. "
"10247240","10249280"," We like Robert Robert spent here for a long time."
"10249720","10251280"," But he's spamming chart and stuff."
"10251700","10252920"," He tried to keep the. "
"10254900","10256800"," Repetitive posts to a minimum of possible."
"10262710","10263930"," No, I think you're weak."
"10264110","10264830"," You're doing fine. "
"10264830","10265530"," We can just relax."
"10269950","10270950"," You're doing just fine."
"10271050","10271250"," We can. "
"10271890","10272750"," I can't read."
"10272930","10274310"," I haven't read the chat that high up."
"10279200","10279600"," Okay. "
"10280340","10281460"," So let's."
"10281620","10281860"," So."
"10281860","10284040"," When we look at the apple chart right. "
"10284400","10285740"," I'll show the apple chart one more time."
"10286620","10287180"," No worries."
"10289180","10291940"," But you always go back in the broadcast to and check that chart right. "
"10293320","10294960"," But we'll look at the apple chart real quick."
"10304760","10305840"," Yeah, we can take it easy man."
"10305940","10307400"," If you are checking out, take it easy brother. "
"10310560","10311420"," I hope you don't."
"10315820","10316620"," Okay, hold on a second."
"10322310","10325270"," Yeah, I don't want to see if I don't get to you. "
"10325770","10326570"," How about this?"
"10326870","10328230"," If you guys really want to see something."
"10329890","10331510"," I will see a super chat."
"10332610","10334510"," Okay, we just send like a dollar or something. "
"10334890","10337330"," I will see those those do pop up right in front of me."
"10342760","10344200"," So if you really want to see something."
"10344420","10346000"," So I can't always read the chat. "
"10346200","10348220"," I have to trade myself and I'm doing work in the background."
"10353570","10354010"," Yeah."
"10354010","10356450"," So like this is start with a baseline here. "
"10356550","10356690"," Okay."
"10357510","10359330"," Try not to spam the chat ever."
"10359330","10362630"," Try not to be like say something once or twice or whatever. "
"10363830","10367190"," You shouldn't have to spam it 10 times anything 10 times."
"10368290","10372290"," If you really want to get my attention, it's not that I'm trying not to pay attention to you."
"10372350","10373970"," If you do a super chat, it pops up. "
"10374090","10374850"," It's like a big bubble."
"10375770","10377550"," So it grabs my attention."
"10380030","10385190"," You can always mute the broadcast and go back and check places where I've reviewed a chart with"
"10385190","10385390"," you. "
"10393430","10396570"," So I'll put winky that I'll do is I'll put these rules."
"10396710","10398090"," I'll put these rules up and winky."
"10399210","10401850"," I'm not mad at Robert either. "
"10402170","10403770"," I don't want you guys to think I'm mad at any of you."
"10404370","10405590"," So what I'll do is this."
"10406090","10410750"," So ask once or twice or like ask once five minutes later, 10 minutes later. "
"10410930","10411890"," When asked again, that's fine."
"10414070","10416150"," If I can't get to it, I can't in my end."
"10417170","10421990"," I've got I'm looking at the charts that you're seeing up here and then I'm trying to trade myself. "
"10424430","10427210"," And I'm trying to make sure there's nothing bad happening in the background."
"10427770","10430570"," I don't want you guys to get caught in anything really bad up here or anything."
"10431010","10434090"," If you guys are long or something, I don't want you to get caught. "
"10434390","10437650"," I don't want to bear to be in a put position here and get caught."
"10438510","10440030"," So I'm trying to do that kind of work too."
"10441070","10444790"," If you don't know how to do it, you can get a snipping tool for Google or for Microsoft. "
"10444990","10447710"," If you have Microsoft Windows type in snipping tool."
"10448630","10452990"," You can always just snap a screenshot, right?"
"10453650","10454990"," Pause the video where you like it."
"10455150","10455830"," Snap a screenshot. "
"10456710","10459710"," Put it on your own charting."
"10461290","10465650"," And then you just rejoin the stream, refresh the page and you come right in back into the live"
"10465650","10466150"," stream again."
"10467910","10469630"," I'm not trying to make money off of you either. "
"10469890","10473850"," Let the super chat just happens to be you can do like 50 cents or something or 25 cents."
"10475050","10477790"," But that's the only way that I can see it if I'm paying attention to other stuff."
"10481630","10483090"," Hey, Emerson, how are you, bro?"
"10492040","10494660"," Yeah, it's built into Windows so you can just take snaps. "
"10495160","10496780"," We'll take a look at Apple just to clear it up."
"10497020","10498000"," I don't want to make anybody upset."
"10500040","10500880"," I got you, Robert. "
"10501060","10501500"," I like him in."
"10501700","10502860"," I got no issues with your brother."
"10503580","10507160"," But I think he's got a point like and people in the chat want to don't want to see stuff"
"10507160","10507840"," get spammed. "
"10508280","10511300"," I don't mind you guys spam when it's going the way we want it to go and stuff like that."
"10511860","10512820"," That kind of stuff."
"10514020","10516440"," So it's kind of like a, you know, it's a weird line. "
"10523620","10524240"," Yeah, no worries."
"10524440","10525100"," I got what you guys are saying."
"10525280","10526060"," I understand that too. "
"10526360","10528000"," They're asking things over and over again."
"10531100","10532720"," So we'll just take a quick look at Apple."
"10534400","10536320"," So let's just talk about something here. "
"10536320","10536560"," Okay."
"10537460","10541340"," So if you're trading Apple, you can trade it against NDX, right?"
"10541560","10546800"," All the other sectors, Dixie bond or, or, um, HYG."
"10547440","10549440"," You can trade it against VIX, right?"
"10550720","10556040"," And you should always be using spy as well because spy is going to give you the direction of the"
"10556040","10556640"," market, right?"
"10556820","10562140"," You've got out the whole together as a group as long as there isn't a decoupling of Apple to SPX. "
"10562800","10566000"," The spider complex, then you're going to want to be checking spy anyways."
"10566960","10569420"," And so just, just as a matter of point here."
"10570020","10571840"," Uh, this is a no man's zone, right?"
"10572580","10574040"," This is, this is a no man's zone. "
"10574560","10576600"," You want to take the trade below or take the trade higher."
"10577300","10580840"," I'm not going to assume without even looking at Apple that that applies to Apple as well."
"10582800","10583220"," Okay. "
"10583620","10588580"," And I'm going to assume that this top right here in spy was pretty close to wherever Apple was."
"10590320","10590680"," Right?"
"10590820","10592020"," So we'll take a look at Apple real quick."
"10593160","10594140"," Uh, hold on here. "
"10595580","10597020"," I hope you're still there, Robert."
"10600260","10601920"," And, you know, same thing, right?"
"10602100","10603900"," We've got our one, our, our three up here."
"10604020","10605700"," This is a big range for Apple today. "
"10607260","10612720"," Came up, didn't quite hit our three, but we knew, we know that in spy, we hit a general top"
"10612720","10613300"," up here, right?"
"10614700","10617100"," Uh, we know we were in a supportive market right now."
"10617160","10619920"," You know that we're in some, like some positive gamma."
"10620920","10622280"," So it's not quite solid rip. "
"10624220","10624660"," Right?"
"10624880","10626100"," You know that Apple's come up now, right?"
"10626200","10627480"," It's now resting on our two."
"10629000","10629440"," Right?"
"10629580","10631660"," You're going to want to at least another attack up here to our three."
"10633460","10635420"," Here is your VWAP on Apple. "
"10636660","10641220"," So if you wanted to reenter a trade for Apple, you take it here on VWAP."
"10643080","10645640"," Or above the EMA is the five EMA."
"10647000","10647440"," Right?"
"10647700","10649100"," We're now testing this five EMA. "
"10649100","10651540"," You could take this trade right here."
"10652220","10655220"," And then what you do is you set a stop loss right here, right below."
"10655940","10660960"," And if you're like, oh yeah, cap people tell me on, on the internet all the time that, uh, never,"
"10661100","10664640"," never set stop losses because, uh, you'll lose or something, right?"
"10665460","10668640"," You can wait for, you can wait for confirmation. "
"10668940","10670920"," This is there your five EMA or your 20."
"10671160","10674740"," You can wait for this to make that take that trade higher, right?"
"10674920","10675920"," So you wait for it above."
"10676340","10680660"," I already told you this is not the place, uh, to be taken long Zorshirts, right?"
"10680800","10682120"," This is the did one in the middle thing. "
"10683140","10685160"," So if you were like, oh, I'm a blow one thing along here."
"10686520","10688140"," You want to see some constructive work."
"10688700","10691600"," If not, you get to see yourself position for puts here. "
"10692220","10694200"," And you wait for the, for the drop below."
"10695020","10699540"," And then you start taking this put down, uh, to the next level, which is what?"
"10699540","10699680"," All right."
"10704200","10705660"," Here's your R one right here. "
"10708320","10709220"," Here's your R two."
"10709780","10710640"," And here's your pivot."
"10714650","10716650"," So it's like a bunch of ways to look at this. "
"10716770","10718110"," You can look at this in the perspective of."
"10720210","10723230"," Wait for the move to show you if it is, if it's up or down."
"10724370","10727830"," The next thing you could show you, you want to see something constructive for a move higher. "
"10728730","10731770"," Or something constructive for a move lower, right?"
"10731770","10735750"," Uh, if you didn't want to wait and you're like, not on a wake cap."
"10735910","10738090"," I, I, I have a, I have a, I have a bearish."
"10738370","10739590"," You're like, I'm bearish here, cap. "
"10740790","10744990"," Uh, what you do is you, you, let's say you enter a put position here and you're going to look"
"10744990","10747150"," for a stop loss above, right?"
"10747450","10747970"," Could be right here."
"10748510","10749230"," Could be right here."
"10750270","10752010"," Uh, does that make sense?"
"10752470","10753770"," Or you're waiting for a move higher. "
"10754090","10756250"," Take that, that move lower here, right?"
"10756750","10759990"," So if you're positioned here, you have your next stop loss above, right?"
"10759990","10762770"," Uh, so that you can take this move lower."
"10763350","10769990"," So like two, two, three different ways you can look at, um, constructive moves, higher constructive"
"10769990","10770810"," moves lower."
"10771290","10773030"," And where you shouldn't be right now, right?"
"10773970","10775530"," Shouldn't be didlin in here. "
"10776210","10779930"," This is kind of where the place to where they, where they grind options down."
"10782610","10786070"," That's another reason why you want to be in for the move, the directional part of the move."
"10786070","10792870"," Uh, this is just an example, but in here, you could see like an apple call, let's say it was"
"10792870","10793310"," a dollar. "
"10795030","10797050"," And let's say it started a dollar right here."
"10797230","10798090"," Let's say the move is up."
"10799870","10803930"," You could see that call go from like a dollar to like 50 cents, right?"
"10804790","10807870"," And then you'd get the move higher and it might go to 86 cents. "
"10808090","10808550"," Does that make sense?"
"10809190","10813270"," See the dealers in here, market makers in here actually reprising options, right?"
"10814030","10819170"," And especially where as time decay, theta kicks in, you're going to see the price of options over"
"10819170","10820410"," time go down, right?"
"10821350","10823430"," So even if it's going up, it's still going down."
"10823770","10829050"," So you want to be grabbing the bottom part of that option so that it, so that you get a"
"10829050","10830730"," print off it, right?"
"10830970","10834690"," So in here, you might see this, you might see that grind in here."
"10835350","10836950"," Does it make sense to you?"
"10837270","10838810"," And that works for puts as well, right?"
"10839210","10840410"," What's the same thing happens?"
"10840630","10845130"," You have the theta burn, especially on like a weeklies or dailies. "
"10845850","10849210"," So you need to grab this top over here and not in here, right?"
"10849470","10849690"," You don't know."
"10849870","10850750"," You don't ever want to be."
"10851490","10852110"," Make sense?"
"10852570","10853570"," Well, I guess you'd want to be down here. "
"10853910","10855310"," I'm going to put the same concept."
"10859030","10859750"," So that helps."
"10860010","10861710"," So I don't know what to say to you on apple right now. "
"10861770","10864970"," Looking around the market, it looks like it needs to cool off a little bit."
"10866670","10872490"," I would suspect here, if you want my best guess, that we're going to trade back down to 133.71."
"10873870","10874670"," Or you know what?"
"10875030","10882270"," I'd like to see a retracement done apple specifically, maybe to right here."
"10883230","10883770"," So what is that?"
"10889360","10893160"," 134.75. I'd like to see at least the push lower here a little bit. "
"10894180","10894960"," So I hope that helps."
"10896220","10901900"," If you want this on a large time frame, you've already got, I mean, let's look at a large time"
"10901900","10902140"," frame."
"10902300","10903560"," We hit 23%. "
"10904660","10905040"," Right?"
"10906620","10908900"," Normally when you see retracement, you'll see this come up."
"10909360","10909520"," We'll hit."
"10910400","10910780"," Right?"
"10910940","10911720"," We got a little rollover. "
"10912660","10916180"," And if we're going to go up and hit that 38%, it's usually something like that."
"10918100","10922100"," And I don't know if it's time frames correct here, but it's usually something like that."
"10922100","10927460"," And then the bears will come in and try to sell this and sell this and sell this right here. "
"10930160","10931480"," How far down does it go?"
"10939110","10939970"," Like right there."

"10944030","10947050"," You can see the one hour trend coming up, right?"
"10950430","10955950"," So, you know, like 133.45. That's my price target. "
"10956490","10957010"," Change my price target."
"10959290","10961950"," 133.71. I'm going to tighten it up a little bit for you."
"10966160","10969200"," Somewhere in this R1 right down here. "
"10969480","10970120"," That's what I'm looking for."
"10970200","10973740"," I'm looking for retracement to R1 to pick this trade back up to stay in trend."
"10974720","10975380"," That's my answer. "
"10975940","10977500"," 130 right now."
"10977560","10979140"," It's going to change, of course, as time passes."
"10979860","10983720"," I'm looking for that retracement right there on Apple. "
"10984520","10985520"," I hope we get that."
"10986460","10989300"," I feel better about a trade off."
"10990660","10991880"," Wherever this winds up. "
"11002150","11004450"," And there's a zero gamma line in Spy right there."
"11006350","11009510"," So zero gamma retracement of 3D3, maybe, on Spy."

"12450040","12452820"," All the money is built into this their gimbal."
"12453320","12455980"," So if you were a cruise ship what you probably do is."

"12468950","12470610"," That's all about the gimbal always."

"12570260","12571960"," So if you if you look at."
"12573280","12577980"," They tried like four wheelers at one time and all the cattle would go running down the down trees"
"12577980","12580940"," and hide amongst down trees so you couldn't rust them up. "
"12581500","12583940"," Say to go back to horses so even today."
"12584680","12588220"," With all of the technology today they still use horses on the ranch."
"12588840","12589880"," To rust up cattle. "
"12591160","12593640"," They will use four wheelers and stuff but not for."
"12594300","12595280"," Going cross country."
"12597160","12598060"," Still use wagons. "
"12599900","12600760"," To graze cattle."
"12601680","12606540"," We go out there and we'll go out there in the springtime and all the calves that have issues have"
"12606540","12607660"," medical issues after they're born."
"12608180","12610220"," They can't brand and pull their balls that cut their balls off. "
"12611020","12616040"," We'll go out there and try to help with the cattle to brand and cut their balls when they're like"
"12616040","12616700"," 200 pounds."
"12617460","12618500"," You get a couple guys in there."

"12631020","12631840"," Stronger than a linebacker."
"12637280","12638040"," You go out there. "
"12638140","12639440"," These guys are real cowboys out there man."
"12639580","12644480"," These guys and the cool part was trying to tell you was they still have test ranges out there for"
"12644480","12645200"," for jets."

"12650320","12650520"," nowhere. "
"12650720","12653760"," They're Russian like fake Russian missile silos silos."
"12654780","12658960"," You'll see these jets come down and do fake strafing runs."
"12659860","12660800"," It is so badass. "
"12661800","12662920"," It's so badass."

"12677630","12678950"," Rocky Mountain oysters."
"12684090","12685970"," Yeah, there's no real setup on spy right now."
"12685970","12687210"," This is kind of like a waiting game in here. "
"12687970","12689170"," There's no trade in here."
"12691910","12692990"," Absolutely no trade in there."
"12702410","12703710"," Yeah, you can lack a Montana moon. "
"12704190","12704770"," Fucking nowhere."
"12711980","12716020"," Yeah, so Estile, I don't want to re-entry an Estile until the retracement is done on spy."
"12717360","12720420"," I'm waiting for the retracement to be over and spy to enter Estile again. "
"12724170","12725190"," That's right outside of Yellowstone."
"12726590","12728190"," Man, I love teetons."
"12729050","12730230"," I love teetons. "
"12732510","12733970"," Yeah, it's still early for Estile."
"12745260","12746680"," Estile is a little early right now."
"12746760","12747240"," Not quite early. "
"12747740","12748720"," I was thinking about re-positioning."
"12748780","12749860"," We should talk about dasto too."
"12751960","12758140"," I'm looking for the spy retracement and there's a second leg down right now in spy coming. "
"12759300","12764860"," Or at least that's what market breath is saying that there's another leg down for spy coming."
"12765200","12766780"," I'm looking for some specific dates, right?"
"12766920","12769980"," Like 23rd to 30th to enter that trade."
"12770700","12773000"," I'm looking for spy to retrace into that time period. "
"12773460","12776460"," You might not happen, but that's what I'm looking for for the next leg down."
"12779580","12781480"," And I'll close that part of the trade."
"12781980","12784400"," I think at the weekly moving average roughly there. "
"12787040","12789520"," So I think that's where that trade takes place."
"12789520","12790780"," I think the spy goes up."
"12791920","12795280"," I think they're going to tell you we're going to 400 or something, 4,000. "
"12795840","12796700"," 400 I'm spy."
"12797320","12798120"," They're going to tell you we're going there."
"12798220","12799740"," Tell you we're going to 440 or something. "
"12801040","12802020"," And they're going to roll it right over."
"12803300","12805640"," They'll get the breath down nice and deep oversold conditions."
"12807600","12812720"," And then we'll go down, hit up with the weekly moving average. "
"12812960","12814680"," I'll close that estile trade."
"12815880","12820360"," And I'll look for a break and hold below weekly moving average to get really nasty on it."
"12830610","12831710"," Yeah, be wary though. "
"12831870","12833950"," There's a lot of bidding on futures right now, but."
"12834630","12838430"," You also have that standing sell order of three almost 400 contracts right above."
"12838890","12839670"," Right where we are. "
"12842190","12844770"," There's a standing order of sell contracts right here."
"12845650","12846530"," Pretty big one."
"12854560","12855260"," Testes blasting. "
"12859350","12860830"," So I started blasting."
"12864270","12865530"," Oh, look at that, huh?"
"12867170","12868230"," Look at that hot sauce."

"14566250","14568310"," Let's get, we'll just leave this on the five EMA."
"14570810","14572510"," Get rid of this so you can see it better. "

"14656830","14659330"," I don't want to get caught underneath this if it goes the other way."
"14678910","14683270"," Tesla here touching its VWAP and five minute EMA."
"14691480","14718320"," Testing VWAP right now. "
"14740310","14743950"," Tesla's starting to break below VWAP and five minute EMA."
"14805160","14807400"," They're really trying to test my stops right here."
"14815700","14816720"," I just got stopped out. "
"14824900","14826620"," I got stopped out big on that one."
"14827560","14828920"," Let's get the one minute here."
"14831080","14832160"," I got stopped right here. "
"14834840","14836480"," That's where I took the stop right here."
"14845440","14846740"," Right on there."
"14847340","14848380"," That's where I got stopped out. "
"14849000","14855540"," We're at 385.94. I took a 10 cent loss on that one."
"14856120","14856660"," One here."
"14857360","14869550"," I threw it"
"14869550","14870010"," up and over. "
"14870850","14874570"," The sellers came right back down right here and threw it right back down."
"14875570","14877530"," Price started down below 385."
"14884710","14887010"," Tesla's now below VWAP on the day. "
"14887010","14891750"," Down below on the five minute chart on the file, the 21 EMA."
"14892550","14894930"," It'll look for a lower low on Tesla as well."
"14897170","14900710"," Let's see what happens here. "
"14901170","14902530"," Probably going to start coming down here."
"14904070","14908520"," Let's see here."
"14923400","14924580"," That was hairy. "
"14925440","14926540"," That was sweating bullets there."
"14929260","14930320"," That's Santa coming."
"14933120","14934040"," That was hairy. "
"14935000","14936860"," Yeah, right in here is where I got stopped out."
"14937500","14939060"," Right where this line is right here."
"14939140","14939740"," I got stopped out. "
"14939960","14941900"," As soon as he broke, as soon as he pushed below here."
"14942660","14943100"," I triggered."
"14943340","14944220"," So the bear's going to want to. "
"14945180","14946520"," The bear's going to want to keep."
"14949400","14952160"," You know, they got a tee off right on this blue line, this ADMA."
"14952460","14956440"," You could see a retracement here to the to the eight. "
"14957260","14960500"," And they want to hold this right here and try to get a lower low here to 385."
"14964410","14965250"," That was spicy."
"14966070","14967210"," It's super spicy. "
"14970980","14972320"," Super, super spicy."
"14973480","14974680"," I was like, we're going up here or not."
"14974920","14975820"," Tesla just broke below. "
"14976080","14977080"," It's a five minute."
"14981670","14982290"," We'll see."
"14982510","14984630"," We'll see if this retracement, how high this retracement goes. "
"14989300","14993080"," See if the bears can tee off on this on this 21 EMA."
"15003420","15006770"," That was nasty."
"15007150","15010010"," I was like sweating there for a minute. "
"15016880","15018820"," Yeah, Santa Riley is still intact."
"15019340","15023260"," So, Santa Riley is still intact right here."
"15023420","15026780"," Actually, Santa Riley is intact down here at 383 14. "
"15027520","15028440"," I'll show you that real quick."
"15028740","15033340"," So, if you guys want to know where Santa Riley intact is, it's down here in the hourly."
"15039350","15042390"," If you guys want to know where Santa Riley is intact, it's right here. "
"15042790","15043950"," So, to see this blue line right here."
"15046130","15051970"," So, you want to see this blue line keep creeping up and then eventually grab and just for some"
"15051970","15052410"," continuation."
"15055190","15057990"," So, 21 EMA on a one hour. "
"15059370","15061130"," Now, we broke above it yesterday."
"15062870","15063750"," Smashed above."
"15064490","15065630"," Smashed above here. "
"15066810","15070690"," And then you want to maintain that trend."
"15071990","15076590"," So, Santa Riley is intact right now currently at this moment at 383 17."
"15077470","15079590"," You want to track this as we move forward as well. "
"15080770","15082890"," Got some just sellers coming in right now."
"15083170","15084110"," Proper taking distribution."
"15089120","15089680"," Looks like distribution. "
"15091200","15093540"," Somebody looking for 383 to buy down below."
"15093540","15094720"," Hopefully we can get down here."
"15095020","15098500"," I took this trade right here to see if we'd break above, but we're not. "
"15098660","15099580"," It doesn't look like we are."
"15100180","15101460"," So, I'm going to stay waiting."
"15101740","15107280"," Now, I'm going to stay down here and looking for a rebuy down below on 383 14. "
"15109240","15111640"," If I miss this, if we go up here, that's fine."
"15112160","15118140"," I'll miss that trade, but for now, for what this looks like right here, I'm going to hope that we"
"15118140","15120200"," can get down here so we can pick up the trade once more."
"15121600","15123240"," I was sweating there for a minute. "
"15123440","15124880"," I was like, are we going up there or not?"
"15129900","15131540"," And they're going to try to tee off right here too."
"15131620","15132960"," You can see them teeing off right on."
"15141500","15144040"," So, we'll do the, we'll do the bear line here now. "
"15153290","15154510"," No, no, I don't want to do that."
"15158530","15160070"," We'll put the bear line back up."
"15160250","15161770"," It looks like they're getting validated here. "
"15165250","15167910"," We'll at least entertain the thought of retracement down here."
"15175160","15176200"," We'll keep that right there."
"15184210","15187220"," It feels like cold this year. "
"15187320","15187880"," We've been making bank."
"15188260","15189180"," This has been a great trade."
"15191400","15193780"," We're not, anyway, we have a former seller rep. "
"15193920","15195000"," We're in by the dip here."
"15195280","15200240"," So, yeah, I want to make a buy if I can."
"15201460","15202900"," I bought this right here. "
"15205160","15207920"," I bought this somewhere in here."
"15208060","15211860"," I bought this trade up and we're right back into that."
"15212020","15214800"," We're right back into that consolidation distribution zone. "
"15216980","15220020"," We're right back in that area of which way are we going?"
"15221000","15223920"," But, you know, a failure is your second failure above here."
"15224320","15224960"," I don't want to see."
"15225200","15226580"," I don't like seeing like that second failure. "
"15226740","15229500"," The failure here, the failure here lower, lower high."
"15231300","15233100"," More than likely, we're going to end up looking lower."
"15234520","15236460"," And we know that the trend is here. "
"15236920","15239840"," So, if we can get back down in here, this is the safer trade as a bull."
"15240480","15241820"," That doesn't mean we don't trade higher here."
"15242100","15247500"," I'm just letting you know that, you know, you go up looking for supply. "
"15248760","15250160"," We looked up for some supply."
"15250740","15253180"," So, at some point, you're going to be looking for where is demand."
"15254140","15256360"," And they're going to want to find out where demand is. "
"15256620","15258560"," You're not seeing a big volume spike right here, right?"
"15259340","15261600"," You're not seeing a big demand line right here."
"15262060","15264840"," So, you have supply here, supply here."
"15265300","15267500"," You've got demand here, but how strong is it?"
"15268260","15272840"," If it's not strong, it's more than likely going to loop back down to where we where known demand"
"15272840","15274040"," is, which is down here. "
"15274740","15277860"," So, your first place you're going to look is here and your second place you're going to look is"
"15277860","15278520"," down below here."
"15279040","15280980"," We know that the bull trade is down here."
"15281800","15283640"," We know that the bear trade is below here. "
"15284660","15285200"," Does it make sense?"
"15285200","15287220"," Supply demand, supply demand."
"15289700","15295440"," If you wanted to pick this trade up higher, you really want to see, you really want to see"
"15295440","15298280"," constructive move above here for this trade to go higher."
"15299540","15303520"," Until you see that, probably not the safest trade. "
"15306950","15307670"," It's dangerous."
"15309090","15309370"," It's spicy."
"15310430","15312650"," We're in a spicy place in the market right now. "
"15317290","15318910"," We're in a very spicy place."
"15331020","15332820"," Do they work on a time frame?"
"15333060","15333800"," Sometimes they're too bad."
"15334140","15337860"," Well, like in an intraday trade, you'll see sometimes like a."
"15338620","15343920"," You're looking for looking for like areas of resistance and support and then you're looking for,"
"15343920","15346640"," you know, one, two, move higher. "
"15347920","15350880"," I'll give a bull like one, two and three, maybe."
"15350880","15356840"," And then higher as like something like this, two, higher and then maybe the pullback for three."
"15357540","15362380"," And then I'm also looking for supply zones, right?"
"15362620","15365860"," And what a bear will do is like we'll sell off down here. "
"15368240","15371360"," What a bear will do is they'll try to trap bulls in here, right?"
"15371560","15375080"," So you get the rejection one, two tries, right?"
"15375360","15377660"," And then by the third one, you're heading lower."
"15378300","15381080"," This is all this right here is high traffic."
"15381460","15383520"," Very dangerous straight in here as a bull or bear. "
"15384740","15385860"," Very, very dangerous."
"15386240","15389060"," You pick the wrong way and it ends up going the wrong way on you."
"15390840","15392980"," So you'll see that an intraday chart. "
"15393180","15394340"," You'll see it on a daily chart."
"15404670","15406170"," Still in traffic right now."
"15417300","15418960"," Bull still trying right now. "
"15419120","15421140"," Bull still trying to break out above here."
"15425030","15426650"," But this looks like more like short squeezing."
"15426910","15433240"," So I think the safe, I think the safe, I just got torched on like 10 cents. "
"15433240","15434840"," So I'm like, yeah, I don't know."
"15435400","15439340"," I'm like, I'll wait until it proves itself that it's going up to jump in that trade again."
"15447310","15448970"," Maybe get some more constructive above. "
"15449150","15449730"," I'll jump on it."
"15499160","15505560"," So you got a, let me see, you got John Kicklider says, how many headlines have we seen out there"
"15505560","15513200"," associating this bounce in US equities to a true recovery and confidence beginning about, I want to"
"15513200","15514380"," make a comment about this guy."
"15516420","15525360"," He's saying, how many headlines have we seen out there associating this bounce in US equities to a"
"15525360","15526860"," true recovery and confidence. "
"15527140","15528040"," I haven't seen that."
"15528200","15531640"," Maybe you guys have a narrative trying to set up a narrative here."
"15532520","15535360"," They say in beginning of a long term bull trend. "
"15535640","15537980"," I don't think anyone thinks we're in a long term bull trend."
"15538440","15539940"," So there's like strike number two."
"15540440","15541780"," This guy's got a bunch of followers too. "
"15543930","15549030"," I think he's, I think he's on the, I think he's got, I think he's part of like, he's got"
"15549030","15549910"," 80,000 followers."
"15550730","15555770"," And then so his next point is the start of a Santa Claus rally question mark."
"15556190","15557130"," Yeah, absolutely. "
"15557370","15558050"," It is."
"15558650","15562730"," It's a retracement rally in the stock market that is anticipated."
"15563910","15569010"," To be clear, I think it is a reflection of fitting liquidity and a move back into range is what"
"15569010","15569410"," he's saying. "
"15570090","15573650"," So I'm kind of like scratching my head over what he's saying here is tweet."
"15577880","15580900"," So I'm kind of scratching my head on what he's saying in his tweet right there."
"15583640","15584920"," Maybe we should, maybe I'll ask him. "
"15584980","15585820"," I'll ask him right now publicly."
"15664080","15665220"," So I'll ask him publicly."
"15680520","15684160"," I never liked when, I never liked when these people, I never liked when news people or. "
"15685300","15688140"," The collectors make fucking wild posts on."
"15689360","15690120"," On Twitter."
"15691140","15694460"," I always want to know what they're, what they're actually what they're doing here. "
"15694720","15695040"," Are they short?"
"15695280","15695940"," Where do they get short on?"
"15696720","15697780"," Where they're sitting short?"
"15698460","15699600"," Are they short from the top?"
"15699800","15701620"," Do they per time it perfectly at four fourteen?"
"15703920","15704960"," Acquiring minds want to know."
"15705640","15706780"," Probably not going to answer that question."
"15706960","15707140"," I bet. "
"15707700","15709360"," If I had to guess he's not going to answer that question."
"15709920","15721420"," I was not"
"15721420","15722500"," not guaranteed."
"15722820","15723960"," Sometimes he's answering me in the past. "
"15724860","15726480"," So I want to see if he answers me now or not."
"15736960","15738120"," Probably not going to get an answer."
"15750380","15764810"," Sure. "
"15813260","15814140"," That's what I want to know."
"15815140","15815940"," I'm not going to get it."
"15816400","15817620"," I guarantee it's going to be. "
"15817920","15818660"," I guarantee it's"
"15818660","15829720"," going"
"15843450","15844030"," to be fucking."
"15870650","15871110"," I'm not going to get it."
"15874010","15874870"," What do you guys do?"
"15875030","15875690"," I'm not reading your tweets. "
"15876810","15878910"," Is this is, is Tesla twerking?"
"15879290","15880930"," Tesla is twerking, isn't it?"
"15907020","15907540"," Nothing."
"15907920","15908520"," No response."
"15909280","15909600"," That sucks. "
"15910580","15911380"," I always like a response."
"15911760","15913240"," I always like to hear what the word is."
"15924430","15926110"," They're never going to tell you. "
"15958770","15960330"," Come on down and pop it down here."

"21072740","21082220"," should see futures get sideways or sold It all kind of leads it leads up to a a opening low"
"21082220","21092120"," tomorrow Looking into these comments it does say in the ECB's forecast and in hours"
"21092120","21098540"," too We have a very rapid reduction in inflation throughout 2023 It comes from values close to 10"
"21098540","21103800"," percent in the fourth quarter of 22 To values around three percent of december of next year So"
"21103800","21106940"," again comments from ECB sentino in the full speech here jay, sorry. "
"21106960","21114620"," I'm just saying the same thing Cheap put department they're dirt cheap."
"21114820","21123580"," We look for tomorrow Yeah Yeah It's what am I looking for?"
"21123680","21125080"," Let's look at what I'm looking for for tomorrow."
"21125180","21134960"," Let's look for Yeah, I'd really like to see this pullback here"
"21134960","21136580"," see that see that move. "
"21136700","21143140"," It's a great move I really like to see this like Even if it's rated high into the close."
"21143700","21149680"," I'd really like to see that like I'd really like to see that I can't say guarantee it's gonna"
"21149680","21155540"," happen, but then I really want to see Uh, my my buy zones lower too, right?"
"21155980","21157140"," Uh, where's the one hour?"
"21157340","21167290"," Let's look at the one hour real quick Yeah, so it's right here So you know,"
"21167330","21173350"," you could have been missing this move if if so there's a couple of things here, so You could"
"21173350","21180810"," attempt to buy like after the bell in here for a move higher before it happens And you're gonna see"
"21180810","21185850"," you're gonna see one of these two moves tomorrow because it's setting up right now for the for the"
"21185850","21192930"," hourly to intersect with the economic news tomorrow Kind of a dangerous place right here for bulls"
"21192930","21198530"," and bears Um, this might be some where you pick up the trade or short the market at 8 30"
"21198530","21204090"," I would I might say stay flat until at least 8 30 tomorrow Uh, but if you're a cash market"
"21204090","21210810"," person only you might miss it too So maybe you can grab a call spread in like 415 or something"
"21210810","21215130"," but you figure This is my buy area."
"21215350","21219390"," It's gonna intersect right with the news tomorrow at 8 30 So there might not be a cash market trade"
"21219390","21225090"," for you here Uh And you can you know if you have bad news you can pick up the trend"
"21225090","21233070"," down If it's a good news, maybe we can catch the trend back up But I would say if you're"
"21233070","21236410"," a bull here Uh sit in your hands until tomorrow. "
"21237110","21247090"," That's my take I'm gonna look to be trading this tomorrow at r2 Um We"
"21247090","21248270"," might miss this trade, right?"
"21250690","21255290"," But I want to see a pullback I'm saying that for a while now, right?"
"21255450","21258610"," I want to see a pullback into Uh tomorrow."
"21258950","21264210"," So if you're a bull, I would say sit in your hands Or you could buy a possibly a A"
"21264210","21269930"," call spread in here or something and then some a bunch of cheap puts for tomorrow So you could burn"
"21269930","21279530"," if the news is good If the news is bad Right back to zero gamma minimum 383 382"
"21282420","21284300"," Those are still pretty high price for tomorrow."
"21284300","21293900"," They're like 39 cents and 26 cents They're priced in some weakness in tomorrow for sure"
"21296080","21299020"," Um I think that's my take on tomorrow. "
"21299400","21303240"," I really want I really like buying you know, you like buying stuff like this, right?"
"21305580","21312900"," Really like buying stuff like this really like buying stuff like this Right, you know, I don't"
"21312900","21321680"," really want to buy that do I Really rather buy this right here Rather like some kind of weakness"
"21321680","21328200"," into the open And then and chase that and if it rolls here, I'd really like to catch that right"
"21328200","21328900"," down too, right?"
"21329000","21332360"," If we start continuing down here tomorrow, it's a banging move, right?"
"21334120","21343900"," Maybe you get the double bottom Um, so High probability I think is"
"21343900","21353880"," the best trade It's probably sitting on your hands till morning High probability trade"
"21353880","21355700"," and you can see it right here, right?"
