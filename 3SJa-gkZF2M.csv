"66330","69630"," Uh, we're getting a bounce right now on..."
"69630","75050"," We're getting a bounce right now on, um..."
"75590","81250"," on the half hour trigger but someone's just asking to see someone asking in the chat right now."
"81830","86690"," Catch it about on the half hour trigger right now but we'll talk about it."
"86770","91710"," We'll look at it at it here in just a minute so let me just one quick second. "
"92010","92790"," There's no rush here."
"93250","99350"," If you're already short you should catch the bounce and get a rejection above."
"99610","100370"," We'll look at it right now. "
"101850","102510"," Hang tight."
"104470","105510"," What are you going to do here?"
"105890","106270"," I'm going to leave."
"106530","115630"," I'm going to keep out the Russian sex bots and stuff but keep those people out and then here"
"115630","119230"," we'll go right over it so it'll hold on here. "
"119710","124990"," Alright so you're seeing a bounce right now if you look on the top right hand side of your screen"
"124990","131150"," you're seeing the bounce on the half hour trigger now so this is something if you have the tool I'm"
"131150","135990"," going to talk to you about this okay so just because you bounce on the half hour trigger does that"
"135990","142290"," mean does that mean that you buy it and continue on price still needs to be above the one in"
"142290","146090"," five minute trigger okay so if like so you need to get above that."
"147010","153070"," Yeah I guess you could take a five minute trade or something like that but you need to get above"
"153070","157010"," to be bullish you get above the one in five minute trigger so price needs to be above the one"
"157010","165010"," in five minute even if it slams down on the half hour hour daily doesn't matter so hey good morning"
"165010","171570"," everybody how is everybody fucking doing this morning I swore in the first five minutes today was"
"173630","181770"," outstanding as a really as a matter of fact this whole week's been good and I'm very happy covid"
"181770","191250"," gone which is good to see hold on here give me one quick second here we got a bunch of"
"191250","199530"," stuff to go over today busy day they're busier than it might even seem so we will go over a"
"199530","204130"," bunch of numbers so what you should see happen here is you should see a bounce off the half hour"
"204130","212370"," trigger if you're bearish you are looking for a continuation to the downside and a rejection up"
"212370","219910"," here okay to slam back down slam into that hourly trigger and then continue to make our way down"
"219910","225210"," the other thing that you're looking for is I'm going to switch over here it says to lower rates"
"225210","229710"," you'd need to be confident inflation is headed back to two percent and we got a lot of talking to"
"229710","235270"," do here like so yesterday I read or hello we'll go over the wee bold chart really quick just split"
"235270","245070"," chart right now and if you're gonna look at SPX right so here's SPX let's take a quick peek at"
"245070","252450"," SPX over here had this gorgeous squeeze up here right whoo-hoo went all the way up and we want"
"252450","258149"," to come back down and bounce off of four five seven five to build up what we need to get"
"258149","267190"," up there and trade that 4600 now we pulled back right to the 45 75 and we're underneath it right"
"267190","273290"," now so what we don't want to see is we do not want to see the squeeze up break underneath"
"273290","281390"," and begin to reject here in this 45 75 because that will likely lead to more downside to come or"
"281390","286190"," at least to close this gap down below here so you see this big fat gap right here that needs"
"286190","291030"," to be closed doesn't need to be closed but it should be closed you don't see a lot of gaps"
"291030","299250"," on we turn the shit off you don't normally see a ton of gaps on SPX you will sometimes see"
"299250","306510"," gaps on SPX but it's very rare you'll see them on spy more frequently not so much on on SPX"
"306510","312570"," so this gap likely needs to be closed the high probability of it and then and then what we'll do"
"312570","319830"," is we'll look for a trade so I'm expecting at this point for this for this gap to be closed"
"319830","326410"," let rest this gapage down here and you can actually see the gapage over here and spoons or spy"
"326410","333570"," excuse me so it not surprised me to see all this be gone okay for a pullback and to close"
"333570","341630"," up all of those gaps to the downside so is there a trade here for you unless you're in put"
"341630","346370"," I had some puts a few minutes ago I actually sold this right here oh wait you can't see that"
"346370","350690"," I sold that I basically sold this right here for a brief bit but then I had put the show"
"350690","356850"," on so I got to fucking close this stuff and then get with you guys so what we'll do is"
"356850","362990"," I will this one's on one minute chart right here on the bottom let me see I can bring this"

"710820","717280"," he said let me see what he posted this morning we find Jedi Marcus this morning and see what he"
"717280","728090"," posted he made a very valid point and his point was let me see what he wrote here he"
"728090","738090"," said what he said my five dates SPX 4800 calls are going to pay off"
"738090","746230"," and I thought that was fascinating because not those fascinating because even I don't know if he"
"746230","753610"," means this but I think that he does and his point is that you don't really have a lot of"
"753610","760550"," time to get to 4800 do you face brought this up yesterday to chase chase brought up a point hey"
"760550","764930"," thanks for subscribing everybody if you guys are having a great day do you saw it here repost my"
"764930","772230"," links link or my post to the stream today see your friends can come watch the show and not come"
"772230","777210"," back in chase right like Chase and be like hey are we gonna keep going up when we're up there"
"777210","783250"," or down there or whatever so he made a good positive this morning I don't know if he meant this"
"783250","788830"," but I think he did he's a very smart man he's an old-school pit trader and his point this"
"788830","794590"," morning was my five-day SPX 4800 calls are going to pay off and the point that I think he"
"794590","803070"," was trying to make was if you don't get up to 4800 pretty fucking soon right pretty soon maybe not"
"803070","811270"," five days but pretty soon you might not get that 4800 before the market really begins to roll into"
"811270","816610"," the next year so I thought that was a great post from him this morning it only got 17 likes"
"816610","821450"," and I'm like people don't pay attention out there and I really like that post to be made this"
"821450","828630"," morning about I really like that post to be made this morning about 4800 is I think that thesis is"
"828630","837390"," basically the same thing that other people have stated which is you only have so much time as a"
"837390","844150"," bull so let's say we hit 460 and start rolling down let's say close all the gaps at 440 and"
"844150","848970"," stuff you really have the time to let's be slapped for 60 we start heading down you actually have"
"848970","854350"," the time even into the beginning of the year to get to 4800 and Chase mentioned that yesterday too"
"854350","859390"," and I tend I'm starting to tend to agree with these guys like you kind of have to keep running"
"859390","864090"," you kind of put the other 200 points to the board get 4800 and you're off and running if you"
"864090","871990"," don't you kind of saying well well you I guess we're not getting 4800 you might catch it in the"
"871990","878010"," new year but the this lead this segues into the next part I'm going to tell you which is small"
"878010","885750"," caps should outperform into March of this upcoming year and if they're outperforming you might not"
"885750","892530"," see that performance the 4800 that you're looking for out of spy unless or S&P 500 unless they"
"892530","897170"," actually do that now I know he made that post this morning in just but at the same time it"
"897170","903230"," brings up the question mark of hey if everybody out there's calling 4800 then you should see that"
"903230","909710"," you know you only got you only got four weeks to see that 4800 so we either got to stick"
"909710","915510"," around 4,600 to get there or we have to start making that March up to 4,800 into end"
"915510","923170"," of year now I don't think I don't think that you're I don't think that I"
"923170","932070"," don't know if I care if it goes to 4,800 I'm more interested in performance"
"932070","939490"," into March and not being panicky about the markets into March so we're going to talk about the IWM"
"939490","945610"," the small caps the rot the RTY smalls today we're gonna we're gonna have a conversation about it"
"945610","953690"," today and see if see if we can gain the insight into the expectations"
"956280","965700"," sorry got another new one of these new cats with me now how you doing buddy coming in to say"
"965700","974690"," hi you guys want just just took some profit here"
"974690","982070"," on some 45s I'm looking for a bounce and then a bloodbath here in just a moment just one quick"
"982070","989810"," second air was so that up I just took profit just now for 28 cents so I'm gonna try to"
"989810","999570"," jump back in here in just a second get a better positioning so I think that small caps trade"
"999570","1006010"," if you're gonna take the trade for the end of rate and create we're gonna talk about rates today"
"1006010","1013730"," too I was I was flabbergasted yesterday after the show I went down the rabbit hole on what the news"
"1013730","1021590"," was the shit they were shoveling out to people yesterday I read all of the speeches and I took a"
"1021590","1026730"," lot of it is double-talk I read all the speeches yesterday that came out and then I read the"
"1026730","1033210"," news on those speeches and I was like what the fuck are they saying right now I was like I"
"1033210","1044480"," was like what I read was just pure garbage hold on a second here scratch"
"1044480","1051450"," that I didn't sell I never got a fill so I'm still sitting here and puts I apologize I didn't"
"1051450","1061080"," catch that I didn't get that fill hold on a second here I'm still long on 455 P so I"
"1061080","1067600"," will I read all the all the quotes yesterday and then I watched the news and I was like this"
"1067600","1073820"," this is they're out of their fucking minds they're pushing this this narrative right now of cutting"
"1073820","1082640"," rates it's not the thing well I shouldn't like the narrative not whether we cut rates or not or"
"1082640","1087800"," when we cut rates even if we're betting that we're gonna cut rates in the springtime that doesn't"
"1087800","1093980"," make it fucking so right just just betting that doesn't mean anything it still brings up the the"
"1093980","1102540"," the question that hasn't been answered yet which it and what's that question I gotta sell this shit"
"1102540","1112000"," hold on here maybe I'll just stay on fuck it I'll just stand them so"
"1112000","1121100"," the thing the the Fed only has so many tools you don't have yields paying"
"1121100","1127940"," and what does that mean if you don't have yields paying and how do they how do they continue their"
"1127940","1134620"," operations it would only be through rate increases so I'm here scratching my head on all of this"
"1134620","1139360"," and even if they are going to cut rates so even let's say even I'm saying let's say I'm saying"
"1139360","1146440"," that to you if they do cut rates let's say they do cut rates we normally still have a major"
"1146440","1154160"," fucking role that comes out of this and it usually gets front run a couple months in advance so I"
"1154160","1158740"," think they will be cutting rates personally heading into summer and fall chasing into winter of"
"1158740","1168260"," 2024 I just don't know I don't like I guess the what it's how we're interpreting it is"
"1168260","1175500"," inaccurate if we even if we do cut rates in a matter of fact in my own view if you're"
"1175500","1180920"," a bull like if you like if you don't want the bull run to end you would probably do better"
"1180920","1190480"," with a you probably do better with a rate environment and not rate cuts I would caution"
"1190480","1198160"," you I would caution you if you believe that we're going to have rate cuts a pause and rate cuts"
"1198160","1204760"," I read this morning to rake that's next year I would be very wary and scared of a major role"
"1204760","1211320"," from that event if that's the truth and we'll be able to see if it happens before it happens but"
"1211320","1217180"," if it happens I'd be pulling the plug on everything you own the market and then re-entering after"
"1217180","1223940"," that after that takes place there's a high probability that you'll get a major roll down and if"
"1223940","1229400"," they're calling for rate cuts in springtime that would mean that they're gonna front run that that"
"1229400","1236040"," process that would mean in December they're correct December you would see the roll start early if"
"1236040","1243480"," that was true it's usually about a two months three months in advance you'll see two three months"
"1243480","1253340"," in advance you'll end up seeing we'll end up seeing that major role take place if you don't believe"
"1253340","1259340"," me I'll try to post some of this stuff on Twitter so that it's permanent the examples of that"
"1259340","1269280"," happening so you can see it oh shit we're fucking bouncing here come on man"
"1269280","1274020"," I don't want to I don't know if I should just leave these on or I know we're gonna squeeze"

"1280620","1286240"," reversal red candle straight down I can get better positioning I wish I had a position I wish I had"
"1286240","1292060"," my position right here that's what I meant to take was that candle right there I ended up catching"

"1299420","1305060"," have made like five or six cents or something so I'm kind of stuck here for positioning for Captain"

"1598780","1608160"," 268 there are some other places to look for for above we've got 276 and then"
"1608160","1617980"," 293 the real major thing here for if you're a Tesla bull the real major thing here is that you've"
"1617980","1626000"," got all of this volatility right here this is not easy to get over my first my initial reaction"
"1626000","1632340"," here is we're gonna put this on a daily to show it to you why I have these here and"
"1632340","1640070"," what why these bars are here and where these bars you know what I want to point out a couple"
"1640070","1646050"," things to you see this right here see that little that little tick that top tick right here this is"
"1646050","1651310"," where these sellers are back here right they're gonna come in and sell you down this next group of"
"1651310","1658050"," sellers is up here right and they're gonna try to sell you down as well now you do have another"
"1658050","1662170"," little bar right in here you get that little top tick that's where sellers stepped in as well so"
"1662170","1668370"," you've got a ton of fucking you got a ton of like traffic to get you have to like bust"
"1668370","1673290"," through and bust through and bust through and I think you can break through it I just think that"
"1673290","1680130"," it's a matter of I think it's just a matter of here's your other one up here and you've got"
"1680130","1684750"," one more way up here let me show it to you get one more way up here that's what all"
"1684750","1690750"," these little lines I make it make these bigger I guess for you guys out there there's one there's"
"1690750","1699790"," another one and then here's another one right here make that for we got this one right here"
"1699790","1709740"," and we got this one right here tap that one or no that's what price is right"
"1709740","1716460"," now so the idea here is that you're gonna need and I think someone just said the call wall on"
"1716460","1721740"," Tesla is a 250 I think someone said the call was a 250 so you're gonna need more call buying"
"1721740","1726620"," to command and stuff like that more puts the command to fuel that run up higher and you're gonna"
"1726620","1732660"," probably need some news to really break above and you're likely going to need the event to be the"
"1732660","1738820"," catalyst for that so this is what I would say to you as a this what I would say to"
"1738820","1743880"," you as a when you have a you have actually have a bull cross happening right now you have the"
"1743880","1750300"," daily trigger crossing the hourly trigger right now on this is very positive by the way for and"
"1750300","1755400"," that's what this bar is right here too is that that big cross that you have right there the point"
"1755400","1764220"," of trying to make you those you likely need news driven news for us to actually smash up here and"
"1764220","1771980"," what I think that news will or can be is going to be the event I think the event is"
"1771980","1778200"," the I got a kitty at my feet right now sitting on my foot is sitting on my foot right"
"1778200","1783260"," now I don't know I don't know cats or assholes but these cats are babies they guess they like me"
"1783260","1791000"," for some reason the idea here is those most of their events are not during market hours you have"
"1791000","1796260"," the event during at least one market hour and then you at least have the ability to horse trade"
"1796260","1806020"," equities or even some of the 23 hour or 24 hour a day indexes that you can trade synthetically for"
"1806020","1813980"," those tickers or for that ticker specifically so I think for you to get up here I think for you"
"1813980","1821320"," to get up here the big the big takeaway here is let me show you this here the big takeaway"
"1821320","1830840"," here is this okay look to buy to look to buy 244 right now 244 245 right and I would"
"1830840","1836300"," also say to you that me I'm going to tell you something here right now if you're a testable write"
"1836300","1845920"," this shit down trend to the upside lies at 244 54 244"
"1845920","1855580"," 54 if you hold that number this trade to the upside is still alive okay the only way you're going"
"1855580","1865420"," to get that trade to pay or print is unknown news from Elon listen to me closely unknown news from"
"1865420","1875360"," Elon okay like I can't stress it enough I told you guys this whole or yesterday I"
"1875360","1882940"," think I told you guys that if you were to trade 10 tesla events you might miss this one but"
"1882940","1886720"," nine out of 10 or seven out of 10 it would have been better for you to wait until after"
"1886720","1893280"," the event now this event is unique normally those events are after market hours this one happens to"
"1893280","1900420"," be during market hours I'm going to expect that this event is during market hours due to Australia"
"1900420","1908180"," just waking up England or Europe being able to trade it the US being able to trade it they probably"
"1908180","1914840"," know that this will have a market impact just like earnings when you have earnings companies will"
"1914840","1920900"," do after 4 p.m. earnings if they have high expectations if you see a company that normally does"
"1920900","1928960"," after the close earnings and they switch to a morning earnings usually not a good thing so my point"
"1928960","1933320"," here is that I think that they're going to drop something on you I told you I think that is"
"1933320","1938420"," they're going to claim that you're going to get you're getting FSD four or five level four level"
"1938420","1945140"," five of FSD now I don't believe that's real it's going to be like it's going to come out shock"
"1945140","1949680"," the market to the upside and that it's going to be further discussed and you're going to find out"
"1949680","1954320"," down the road that that's three to five years away and that's what it is about three to five years"
"1954320","1961300"," away if you don't already know that so I would say to you if that doesn't happen or some news"
"1961300","1967960"," that we don't know comes out on that on that on that Tesla event you're not going to see those"
"1967960","1973200"," prices up there you might see them you may see them in a couple weeks and you might not see"
"1973200","1978780"," them if the market even rolls over this could be a tease here so the only thing that I could"
"1978780","1985400"," tell you on this would be the only thing that I could tell you on this would be the crude"
"1985400","1991640"," thing to do would be to wrap it up before you get to the event like wrap up your lungs"
"1991640","2000960"," sit on your hands and wait until this expiry is over until this next Tesla option expiry is over in"
"2000960","2008120"," case there is good news or maybe trade it by owning the underlying or maybe trade it where you have"
"2008120","2014860"," a lot of fucking time on those calls and do call spreads do not just own fucking calls you can"
"2014860","2022260"," I shouldn't say that because when Tesla split that both both last time's Tesla split I did own"
"2022260","2029400"," calls but those only printed because there was renewed interest the following day there was more"
"2029400","2034940"," call buyers stepping in to keep the IV high on those calls so just be wary of it if you're"
"2034940","2043260"," a Tesla trader Tesla bull on that move and how you structure your trade and you have a ton of"
"2043260","2048520"," volatility up here that I want to you know to get up here you're going to need news you need"
"2048520","2053380"," news driven you need all these shorts to come off need all these sellers embarrassed to come off"

"4380870","4389430"," they can take you can compile every holiday rally every year and deduce that it comes out um when"
"4389430","4397750"," it comes out but i'll be honest with you every year if we get a holiday rally for q4 and"
"4397750","4407590"," maybe potentially even into q1 of the of the next year the following year um it can"
"4407590","4414870"," be whenever right the holiday rally can be the point i'm making to is that the holiday rally uh can"
"4414870","4422750"," happen at any time uh so we're going to look at uh seasonality here and we're going to chat"
"4422750","4434130"," seasonality and hold on a second here i'm going to bring up the seasonality chart hold on spx"
"4434130","4443880"," we're going to look at seasonality i think hold on here and it's not really the best"

"4452940","4459220"," switch over really quick so if you go over to this is um if you go to this screen right"
"4459220","4465960"," this is spx seasonality we'll go through spx seasonality um let me see if i can bring up yeah i"
"4465960","4471240"," can't bring up uh wm but what i want to show you here is uh but i want to show"
"4471240","4480770"," here is this is current price the light green this is seasonality right what to expect and you can"
"4480770","4484390"," see they're coming into that point we're beginning to roll down right so if you're like looking"
"4484390","4491710"," right here we're beginning to roll down into the beginning of december right you see that here and"
"4491710","4498650"," then you get a late december rally up into end of month okay so i want to talk to you"
"4498650","4504030"," guys about this really quick squeezing up right now on on spy now i want to talk to you briefly"
"4504030","4508370"," about this um i'm going to i'm going to mute this really quick so i'm going to mute my camera"
"4508370","4514430"," and all that so you can see it um put that right there okay so i want to talk to"
"4514430","4520650"," you about seasonality on spy okay we're going to start with spy we should start to see even if we"
"4520650","4526930"," go up and get an all-time high we should still see some bearishness into the end of month okay"
"4526930","4532170"," so i want you to see that here okay i want you to look at this all right and start"
"4532170","4540700"," to see you got four days left and then start to blast down okay so if you if you're looking"
"4540700","4545820"," at this from the perspective of like the next four sessions or so we can go up again we can"
"4545820","4550980"," go down but then you should see a roll into about mid december now if you go back over here"
"4550980","4559040"," into january uh so if you look at the last sessions right of the year uh we tend to begin"
"4559040","4566200"," to turn to the upside right into the end of the and then we have some continuation into the"
"4566200","4572780"," beginning of the year first week maybe even into the 30th session first second week and then maybe"
"4572780","4579480"," even into the 33rd session of the start of the year the only thing that i'll tell you here is"
"4579480","4586180"," that uh the only thing i want to comment on this is if you're looking to make this buy towards"
"4586180","4595340"," the middle end of december on spy or even ndx they tend not to outperform if we get that they"
"4595340","4602060"," if we tend not to outperform like you do on small caps in an environment where we're possibly going"
"4602060","4611460"," to cut or pause and cut rates so there's that there's that caveat cut rates pause rates okay so if"
"4611460","4620580"," you're looking to sell the market into mid december you probably want to sell spoos or tech"
"4620580","4629100"," okay and then come in the middle of december and uh and pick that uh trade back up again if"
"4629100","4634300"," you think if you're more comfortable with that trade i think your better trade is uh i wm or um"
"4634300","4640880"," the rut right for out performance in that time period but you can do whatever you want uh out there"
"4640880","4646960"," and i think that i wm does better this year because of pause or ray cuts now saying all that"
"4646960","4652720"," shit right there right we have that looming forty eight hundred on the board how do we get forty"
"4652720","4659000"," eight hundred if we're not going to follow this seasonality over here right so if we have this"
"4659000","4664560"," thesis if we're like okay we we're gonna so you listen closely if you think that if you're with me"
"4664560","4671380"," and you think we should begin to get bearish into the first of the month december right and start"
"4671380","4677860"," to send this down into the middle of december we we are positioned for that trade and we already"
"4677860","4685280"," know that if price stays above the hourly trigger right and then you guys want to you guys probably"
"4685280","4689360"," want to see seasonality for ndx too i'm going to show that you show you that next here's nazdak"
"4689360","4694160"," seasonality as well same thing slow grind down in sideways and then you get your end of the year"
"4694160","4700400"," move up so if you think if you think personally if you're like oh or i guess if you think"
"4700400","4704360"," hey cap i don't think we go down at the beginning of the summer because people are talking about"
"4704360","4708200"," that right there's bulls out there talking about that the only caveat that i would say to you on"
"4708200","4714760"," this would be as long as price stays above the hourly trigger on both tech and sb 500 keep trading"
"4714760","4721600"," it up to that forty eight hundred okay so if you're a bull we're sitting right now on uh we're"
"4721600","4727180"," sitting right now on the hourly trigger as long as we stay on this hourly or above this hourly"
"4727180","4736060"," trigger you can still trade that trade take that trade trade that trade of uh we're going to forty"
"4736060","4740820"," eight hundred to the end of the year okay so i'll leave you with that caveat if we begin to"
"4740820","4748500"," reject off the hourly trigger if we begin to reject off that hourly trigger i want you to if we"
"4748500","4753040"," begin to reject off that hourly trigger right we go we go below it right then i want you to"
"4753040","4757800"," like uh listen to me if you're a bear out there you know this if you're a bull okay if"
"4757800","4765100"," we begin to sell off underneath that hourly trigger into this monday uh get your fucking bear suits"
"4765100","4769720"," on into the middle of the month at minimum maybe even the third week of the month of december and"
"4769720","4773160"," i'm going to prove this point one more time to you here okay i want to show you one other"
"4773160","4782620"," thing really quick i posted this on"
"4782620","4789620"," i posted this on uh on fint witt this morning and i want you guys to look at this okay"
"4789620","4798740"," with me so seasonally and the jpm caller right tells us something is amiss"
"4798740","4807360"," okay so if we look at uh previous examples now this is history right not guaranteed history doesn't"

"4889550","4896070"," the year it would it would be a fair assumption to say hey I looked back on the last four"

"4918150","4923270"," squeeze up maybe get another day or two of upright then we come back down and blast down into"
"4923270","4928070"," middle of december and then there's your holiday rally right there whoop into the end of end of the"
"4928070","4935490"," end of the year you see that you see what i'm saying here so this is the the hype this"
"4935490","4941530"," is the probability of what's going to happen is it guaranteed no can we go up to uh just start"
"4941530","4950230"," ripping up into 4800 in the year sure but it's unlikely the more likely path is going to be that"
"4950230","4956530"," we go up here to 4600 come back down try to squeak do a squeak out there's your eczema's or"
"4956530","4963070"," your holiday rally right and then maybe you get that that uh first few weeks of january and you hit"
"4963070","4970470"," your 4800 up here does that make sense so just be conscious of this as the rest of the rest"
"4970470","4978770"," of the year plays out and into q1 of 2024 then you get your 4800 and you get your front"
"4978770","4984850"," running of rate cuts and all that kind of stuff another caveat to understand about this is that we"
"4984850","4991890"," have a fed rate decision on december 11th and 12th so you know we have a fed rate decision on"
"4991890","4999430"," december 11th and 12th that could be something where you get an actual rate increase and the market"

"5006010","5015990"," if you get no rate increase in december on 11th 12th that would be the fifth uh no"

"5021530","5028910"," a rate increase in december 11th 12th historically we do not ever raise rates again so if that's"
"5028910","5036610"," the case you could then see that be the trigger on the 11th to squeeze up that 480 for liquidity"
"5038330","5047750"," to sell a roll uh that should come in about two months it should take about two to three months"

"5055810","5061610"," with two cuts into next year it would probably take about two months to get that roll down started"

"5138360","5146200"," sitting in puts right now i only lost two pennies so i'm not too hot too angry um so the"
"5146200","5155720"," idea here is that you're going to expect okay weakness in the market below the hourly trigger"

"5163810","5170090"," expect heading into the first of december into the first like after monday or i think it's monday"

"5186340","5191260"," be given that last day because of the first on friday it's into the week right but i would expect"
"5191260","5200380"," for weakness to begin on the first possibly monday instead and i would expect that weakness to last"
"5200380","5209980"," into about the 11th and 12th for joron pao there is a caveat the price needs to be below the"

"5216660","5223920"," maintains above the hourly trigger we will continue to trade it up in the short term no big put"

"5234700","5238680"," trigger you're going to say to yourself expect to be weak into about the middle of the month of"
"5238680","5247160"," december and then we come into that joron pao the rate decision right uh we're going to listen to"
"5247160","5252380"," see what they what he has to say and if he gives you a rate increase you're likely going to"
"5252380","5259920"," get some uh short term uh blood in the marketplace two three four days something like that and then"
"5259920","5266300"," you'll get your out you'll get your end of the end of the year holiday rally if joron pao does"
"5266300","5273060"," not give you an increase there is a high probability that the market will seek out liquidity to the"

"5306880","5311980"," shit i still got puts on there she calls on i was panicking there but maybe i should have been"

"5916990","5925910"," guys all understand all of this so far okay good i did post and pin this concept on my twitter"
"5925910","5930930"," handle so if you go to twitter i've got a pin right there you can just review it right there"
"5930930","5937010"," everything i just went over here with you i just posted a very simplified version on twitter it's"
"5937010","5942790"," like crayons you can just read it it might not be the exact date but in and around there you"
"5942790","5949830"," should see those actions take place so i did post it on twitter uh for you it's very simple i"
"5949830","5953570"," will trade this with you so it's not like you're it's not like you're gonna have this information"
"5953570","5960250"," and not expect us to be looking at this in the future as we approach those dates as we approach"
"5960250","5965550"," the first the 15th uh the end of the month of december and then we come into the new year"
"5965550","5971670"," uh i'll keep you updated and when we go to the Jerome Powell's uh rate decision we will adjust"

"5977530","5983200"," you think that we're done raising rates uh or do i want to even ask that do you guys think"
"5983200","5988480"," that we're getting a rate increase in december or not that's the big question do you think we're"
"5988480","5995140"," getting a rate increase i'm just going to get rid of this right now we'll we'll deal with we'll put"
"5995140","6000640"," that up later if only if we get above that red bar and we'll put that box up there right"
"6000640","6017470"," there how"
"6017470","6026970"," probable is the chance of more downside uh until we have a formula for this until"
"6026970","6034450"," that thing right here turns green see that positioning so that says short till that thing turns uh"
"6034450","6042830"," till that thing turns green only then can you take a long call with confidence like a high so like"
"6042830","6049050"," a high probability it's the only time you can you can take with high with a high probability like a"
"6049050","6059160"," high like this i want i want i want i want i want i want"
"6059160","6089480"," i have"
"6089480","6095600"," a video that goes over how you know if you're like so there's like a 30 probability here of being"
"6095600","6100460"," right as a bull like because we're above the one minute trigger but the probability increases to"
"6100460","6114620"," about 70 to 90 percent um once that box turns red uh green kstg"
"6114620","6124020"," i want to say here pstg you guys have any other tickers you want me to look at"
"6124020","6139630"," we'll look at a gme here in just a minute i'll"
"6139630","6146010"," see what you guys are saying here i'm missing so many what you guys are saying uh rivian i'll do"
"6146010","6153730"," rivian right now r i vn all right that's enough upst uh that's four i got four tickers that's a"
"6153730","6161970"," lot let me look at uh youtube i may be anything but i think i question all right you guys"
"6161970","6168990"," are requests on youtube if fed does raise it does that mean the fed would keep more control it's"
"6168990","6178170"," a good question um if you are a um"
"6178170","6187250"," if i want if you're a bull historically if you are a bull right a continue as long as we"
"6187250","6193090"," raise rates and hold hold and raise or i should say that i'll let me rephrase that as long as"
"6193090","6198850"," we raise rates as a bull we should trade sideways and up with normal pullbacks it should look like"
"6198850","6207010"," this it's what it should look like just uh just like this grind grind grind pullback grind grind"
"6207010","6214350"," grind grind pullback grind grind grind pullback as long as we're raise or raising rates or holding"
"6214350","6224030"," with the potential to raise rates uh we should do that historically if uh the banks"
"6224030","6231010"," know that they're going to cut rates not you and i if they know that we're done raising rates which"
"6231010","6237010"," we don't know right we do have some historical things to look at what historically if they don't"
"6237010","6242150"," raise a fifth time fifth rate decision they never have in the going all the way back to 1890 they"
"6242150","6248030"," never have so we're we're going to rely upon that to say if they don't raise rates we're likely"
"6248030","6257790"," done with this rate cycle so if we're done with the rate cycle traditionally what happens is we"
"6257790","6265230"," will get a liquidity grab and then over the course of about two months we will start to trade down"
"6265230","6272170"," and test a bottom find out where bottom is and i will show you that later today those historical"
"6272170","6280450"," examples uh now the question of if we're going to raise again or not the question of if we're going"

"6324510","6331010"," to make that high uh we should go back down and believe it or not revisit at least um at"
"6331010","6335350"," least the 3500 or so right around that 3500 we should go back and revisit that if we fail to"
"6335350","6344830"," make the new high is it possible they've been doing that since at the end of October traditionally"
"6344830","6350390"," no if you guys know anything about uh wake off or wake off we normally have a trough and we'll"

"6361870","6367530"," down uh it's the only we'll uh the only other two examples outside of those two examples would be"
"6367530","6371590"," World War II uh i think now that might be it to World War II i think was the last"
"6371590","6377670"," time we've had that example uh no the great depression i apologize four examples in history of uh"
"6377670","6383550"," of having that uh check go all the way down the trough is normal and then the second leg through"
"6383550","6390090"," the trough that'd be breaking below 3500 and getting like 2800 and you know something cool if you"

"6432810","6439090"," sometimes we have a quick squeeze that our immediate roll down if bulls do have the if bulls are"
"6439090","6444630"," still demanding here and we come all the way up here and we actually get above you will see us"
"6444630","6450210"," start to consolidate here and i will get bullish again and we will see that bull cross up here and"
"6450210","6460130"," we'll take a long over here you're getting"
"6460130","6463670"," the tool by the way it leads me to ask someone here and see how soon i get supposedly i"

"6562330","6572750"," good it's good daily chart i"
"6572750","6578550"," like the ticker i like that it's a i don't know anything about um what their ERs have been but"
"6578550","6583490"," i'm going to assume they're good they're getting a little long right now i'll tell you that this is"
"6583490","6588430"," they're a little bit long in the tooth here on their weekly uh they're monthly there's a little bit"
"6588430","6593990"," of selling going on the background that you can't see you can actually see it right here they're"
"6593990","6597570"," selling up but it's still not bad this should still come up this should still come up right here"
"6597570","6603790"," you still have bullishness likely for multiple weeks you have some highs back here to check i want"
"6603790","6609790"," you to check this one out right here get some highs here to look for highs here and also right"
"6609790","6615310"," here and likely some kind of a move up in here right there you can see you'll have a little"
"6615310","6625290"," bit more to go now so bullish here on pstg now price target uh 50"
"6625290","6634710"," bucks right there price target and i'm going to expect a big pullback on that trade"
"6634710","6640190"," uh if you're looking for fundamentals i'd have to check out their fundamentals with you or on the"
"6640190","6644230"," side and see if they're beating all their ERs and that kind of stuff if there should be some"
"6644230","6648690"," continuation i'm going to assume that they have year-over-year good sales that kind of stuff"
"6648690","6652610"," quarter over quarter they're probably i don't know who this company is pure storage i'm going to"
"6652610","6656650"," also assume that they're making hand over fist money they're not development or anything like that"
"6656650","6662890"," so i think it might have heard of these guys but anyways the point on this trade would be if"
"6662890","6668950"," the buy-in down here was at 10 bucks i would expect a mark-up of 150 percent to 300"
"6668950","6674810"," percent on this company on pure storage i have i don't know any other fundamentals off just talking"
"6674810","6680110"," to you guys about it but the initial target would be that 50 bucks up here and as long as"
"6680110","6689050"," price stays above let's talk about price really quick um or where to buy the dip for this run let's"
"6689050","6695690"," check this really quick you're able to come back down there they like that monthly trigger they"

"6785220","6787800"," uh 35 bucks"
"6787800","6797760"," you will see a break at any point of"
"6797760","6808710"," 35 bucks you have a high probability of going all the way down to 30 bucks right down there so"
"6808710","6818330"," trade is dead under 35 dollars that's pstg the next one we're going to look at is uh"
"6818330","6831960"," gme uh so"
"6831960","6839180"," gme is coming into its weekly trigger if you're if you are a bear uh so see gme up here"

"6851390","6859770"," going to come back down to 15 bucks so if you're a gme bull automatically i'm going to expect a"
"6859770","6866370"," role here on gme who come over here and start sending this down"
"6866370","6876170"," and then hopefully this daily trigger will help you out if at any point gme breaks"
"6876170","6883890"," below 15 dollars the trade is dead uh so if you like i i know don't tell me about how"
"6883890","6890630"," much you uh gme is going to fucking thousand dollars um so if if at any point you break price"
"6890630","6897910"," below 15 dollars we're gonna head start heading down again on gme okay so be very careful here um"
"6897910","6903950"," as a matter of fact i'll put it i'll show you here all the examples of what happens when you"
"6903950","6913290"," get too greedy this stuff right here you want to see what that monthly is way up here so that"
"6913290","6922770"," pullback on gme if you're super bullish here right i'm going to expect the squeeze up pullback"
"6922770","6931430"," patch the daily trigger here the hourly trigger and then x target is 25 dollars up here okay"
"6931430","6943470"," so right now gme uh i'm going to do here i'll just i'll draw this on a better way squeeze"

"7814010","7819990"," guys are saying you know what are you saying right now the problem with Rivian is sellers seem to"
"7819990","7826570"," have a large can and they can fire when they want to drive it back down they really do not"
"7826570","7834430"," like a near eighteen dollars on Rivian um we'll check back you know and check Rivian for you uh"
"7834430","7839070"," i'll tell you that where i showed you that hourly trigger if we get underneath it that's your your"

"7852170","7856650"," see if the buyers are stronger than the sellers here if they can squeeze this up or if they get"
"7856650","7864820"," rolled down or if they just get rolled and we head to back down to the downside it's kind of"
"7864820","7872450"," the place right here you're going to find out what happens right now this is the this is the houry"
"7872450","7878490"," bullish or bearish you want to see a back check on you want to see this cross right here maybe"
"7878490","7892660"," a back quick liquidation break and then a push higher move that"
"7892660","7912030"," over for you hey"
"7912030","7921080"," you're welcome Stacey if i can get to PLTR and AMD i will you know what you know a lot"
"7921080","7926820"," of these tickers you guys are talking about i want to talk to you guys about some uh so a"
"7926820","7933320"," lot of the tickers that you guys bring up to me what i would recommend that you do right is"
"7933320","7938260"," uh you know i want to tell you guys something like the reason i'm bringing this up is not nothing"
"7938260","7946120"," negative or anything when you guys are trading tickers like AMD okay they're they're a really good"
"7946120","7954620"," example and we just had an example of AMD i think on their Q2 uh i think it was AMD's"
"7954620","7961080"," Q2 but i correct me if i'm wrong but i think it was Q2 or Q3 kind of a Q2"
"7961080","7966920"," Q3 maybe Q2 of this year i think it was AMD it was either AMD or it was um i"
"7966920","7973740"," think it was AMD it's like AMD i think sold off on their er report it's either AMD or it"
"7973740","7980920"," was um or it was um i feel um Nvidia but i think it was AMD i think what they"
"7980920","7988640"," did was they sold off on their er and then like three days later uh they announced AI remember that"
"7988640","7993920"," i think it was Q2 or Q2 it was Q1 and then they just fucking went to the moon right"
"7993920","8000900"," like boom to the moon they're a good example for my what i'm trying to say to you but uh"
"8000900","8007100"," more to the point would be this a lot of the tickers that i get requested on the show are"
"8007100","8016440"," tickers that usually run with the market so if you if you're asking me to chart something for you"
"8016440","8021680"," that trades with the markets it will likely continue to trade with the market it's why it makes up"
"8021680","8028440"," the s&p 500 the uh nq ndx right it's why it makes up the NASDAQ 100 uh so i"
"8028440","8033980"," want you to think about that this your favorite stock so if your favorite stock is trading with the"
"8033980","8042000"," market right and you're trying to trade that individual ticker with the market it's kind of"
"8042000","8051940"," pointless right so i'm going to give you two points here the first one would be why bother trading"
"8051940","8060280"," individual tickers and taking on that individual risk when you can trade an index and uh beat the"
"8060280","8067080"," mark or beat everybody else with just investing in an index does that make sense to you so if you"
"8067080","8074220"," are trading one individual ticker right that trades with the market you might as well take the risk"
"8074220","8081000"," off and uh spread that risk around many tickers does that make sense to you hopefully it does okay"
"8081000","8089320"," so if you want to trade or have an edge on the greater market like have an edge over spy"
"8089320","8095080"," or have an edge over iwm have an edge over the queues what i would recommend for you to do"

"8102000","8111840"," don't know if it's that don't deserve to sell"
"8111840","8121400"," off that are a part of the rest of the market so an example would be this if queues are"
"8121400","8130940"," going up right and one day of that week you see AMD uh trade against the"
"8130940","8141140"," S&P 500 or the unless"
"8141140","8147180"," it was something fundamentally wrong with that ticker even if you have to wait so if you want an"
"8147180","8154820"," edge to beat the market the greater market in every morning or once a week maybe every Friday you"
"8154820","8159160"," every Friday in the morning at 8 a.m you get your Cheerios out you get your great nuts out"
"8159160","8167160"," you get your cocaine out you do whatever you're gonna do and you review tickers that are part of"
"8167160","8175600"," the S&P 500 or the or NASDAQ big players like AMD or even small players and uh you you"
"8175600","8183180"," look for tickers that are unusually down and maybe you pick those up to trade the reason i'm making"
"8183180","8189340"," that statement is because if you and 10 other people ask me to chart out five tickers that follow"
"8189340","8195120"," the greater market i'm basically charting out the same ticker aren't i so and if you want to beat"
"8195120","8201100"," there's no no reason to want to trade that ticker individually unless it's outperforming queues or"
"8201100","8209740"," outperforming S&P 500 to get to gain an edge to beat the S&P or or NASDAQ so my"
"8209740","8217020"," recommendation here would be to have some kind of a tracker out there for a ticker so that you can"
"8217020","8223139"," beat the market the inverse of that some tickers do beat the market like in videos beating the"
"8223139","8228500"," market performance right now it's even beating the queues right some of the magnificent five and"
"8228500","8233420"," seven are doing the same thing the other thing that i would say to you would be rather than trading"
"8233420","8238440"," those individual tickers and just saying uh fuck the spy or fuck queues and you're like i don't"
"8238440","8242719"," want to do that i like these companies and stuff like that wait for them to have some kind of"
"8242719","8247860"," a bad news where the rest of the market's going up and it's going down on the other side of"
"8247860","8255280"," this too would be we do a stock picking here and i'm always looking on down days for stocks that"
"8255280","8261020"," are still up on those down days um if those tickers are still up so you want i want you"
"8261020","8266320"," to know this right here so you're going to see this backtest on this bullish cross here so you're"
"8266320","8271480"," going to see this test if this test is successful we should squeeze straight up if the test is not"
"8271480","8278870"," successful we're going to roll this ship straight down to the depth so um so but the idea here"
"8278870","8284370"," would be this if if you have a basket of stocks that you like and uh they trade with the"
"8284370","8288629"," market wait for a bad day or a bad week for that ticker if they have nothing fundamentally wrong"
"8288629","8293450"," with them try to pick those tickers and not just uh hey everybody's trading this or everybody likes"
"8293450","8298950"," this or that or whatever the other caveat would be that one ticker we looked at i believe it was"
"8298950","8307290"," PSTG outstanding ticker to be trading it's probably what probably it looked like it um it launched"
"8307290","8312930"," in under three years it looks like it's being accumulated by by hedge funds regardless of market"

"8318850","8328660"," greater market does that make sense yeah vulture trader and"
"8328660","8334500"," winky does the same thing so like winky's a good example because he's like well why bother trading"
"8334500","8340320"," individual tickers if i can just try if i can just buy the spy on a major low right i"
"8340320","8347160"," have greater exposure i have less risk if meta dies one day or if tesla dies one day right i"
"8347160","8351959"," can just buy spread the spread the risk around uh but if you really want to make a dent you"
"8351959","8357879"," really are looking for those uh uh the the symbols that make up or the tickers that i should say"
"8357879","8364520"," the tickers that make up that uh that index and wait for it to have some kind of a um"
"8364520","8370260"," some kind of a like falling out for a week or two or a month or whatever and uh you"
"8370260","8374780"," buy that ticker on the lows you buy them when they're down the dumpster fires and you will then"
"8374780","8388460"," outperform uh the greater market make sense okay yeah yeah it"
"8388460","8393620"," hasn't happened in a lot recently but uh it does happen a lot oftentimes i get people ask me the"
"8393620","8398700"," same tickers like hey can you chart apple can you chart mess misfit which is microsoft can you can"

"8406900","8411040"," fucking same and when they're not the same that's when you maybe we can compare a couple of these"
"8411040","8416220"," charts maybe we should do that when we're done with this right here to see if we squeeze up uh"

"8428770","8437490"," yeah i don't well maybe i should overlay the magnificent seven or five and you can actually look at"
"8437490","8444270"," how they track the market but then how they have uh blast downs and that's when you should have"

"10938790","10940970"," cutting in early 2024?"
"10941490","10946910"," Probably not, but I think the messaging will shift from hawkish holds Hey, we didn't hike today,"
"10946950","10952130"," but we could to you know a world where more if it's it's like a dovish hold Things are moving"
"10952130","10957470"," in our direction, but it's about enough confidence before we start cuts and and for us that means"

"10985750","10992250"," I think relative to where markets are we think inflation comes down but a little more slowly And"

"16777130","16782450"," It hasn't but was it not robust the first time It was it was but I think we're we're approaching"
"16782450","16787290"," it differently and I just don't want to Uh, it's it's just not something I feel other than saying"
"16787290","16790210"," that we're aggressively pursuing Succession. "

"16810870","16813450"," for a second because one of the things you did and I want to get your thinking and just"
"16813450","16820250"," understanding how you think about it Uh, you went on television over the summer Sun Valley and you"
"16820250","16825210"," put out a lot of things on the table You said, you know, we're thinking about selling ABC and the"
"16825210","16825830"," linear channels."
"16825850","16830110"," We're thinking about finding a partner for ESPN We're in the midst of trying to figure out with"
"16830110","16830290"," hulu. "
"16830550","16835090"," You've now resolved that You talked about some the creative channel you put everything out there"
"16835090","16840250"," Um, and by the way the folks at ABC just just up this way almost had a heart attack when"
"16840250","16846350"," when when they uh when they heard all this What was your thinking in terms of just take us inside"
"16846350","16853030"," the thinking of saying that all All out a lot of CEOs try to wait until they have each deal"
"16853030","16861150"," done I Spent a year since I came back fixing a lot of problems that the company has had and"
"16861150","16865730"," dealing with a lot of challenges Some that were brought on by decisions that were made by my"
"16865730","16871330"," predecessor Some that are just basically the result of a tremendous amount of disruption in the"
"16871330","16878030"," world and in our business including dealing with the business model that those linear channels have"
"16878030","16888030"," rested on have Has succeeded on top of for decades and sometimes when I When I'm looking for kind"
"16888030","16895250"," of a reaction to my own thought process I like to test that process in public particularly In ways"
"16895250","16901370"," that I might be able to actually get a reaction from the investment community so my thought was at"
"16901370","16907770"," the time that I would Essentially be public with some of that thought process I think what I said"
"16907770","16913410"," about the media networks at the time was That everything was on the table and they might not be"
"16913410","16918850"," core to our company if I think I think I went that far And I that was a means of"
"16918850","16924310"," my saying to wall street or the investment community That our heads were not in the sand about the"
"16924310","16929650"," challenges that those businesses were having I did not want to get accused of being kind of an old"
"16929650","16936170"," media executive We're a company that had already shown an ability to basically Adapt to new"
"16936170","16936670"," circumstances."
"16937190","16941610"," So I wanted one convey that and to see what the reaction would be would it be applauded?"
"16941890","16947450"," Would it not I did not say they were for sale the coverage of what I said said they were"
"16947450","16952750"," for sale There's a theme here by the way a little bit Just in terms of what it's being easy"
"16952750","16957830"," for sale and what is being and what is accurate No, it is not for sale, but like all of"
"16957830","16962610"," our assets we constantly are evaluating What is their value to the company today?"
"16963350","16964870"," What could the value be tomorrow?"
"16964870","16966130"," Is it a growth business?"
"16966390","16970550"," Is it a business that but you like the business don't track And there's been a big question about"
"16970550","16974990"," the linear linear channels What we've discovered in this process, which has been unbelievably"
"16974990","16981330"," rigorous at the company and involves a number of executives who are managing those businesses We've"
"16981330","16988450"," determined a few things one that They can be run more efficiently With some difficult choices you"
"16988450","16994010"," mentioned cutting over seven billion dollars in cost we can do that Second they can be run in"
"16994010","16999730"," partnership with those businesses that sit atop the new business model Which is streaming and they"
"16999730","17005950"," there are means of aggregating audience of advertising cost Of basically Agriating audience"
"17005950","17012170"," reaching more and different people and so we actually through this process of being more public"
"17012170","17017910"," about What might happen or what could happen and really rolling up our sleeves and figuring out is"
"17017910","17019090"," this something we should do?"
"17019270","17022290"," Should they be divested should they be kept if they are kept?"
"17022830","17028230"," How should they be run and actually they're being run much more efficiently today than they were in"
"17028230","17030750"," july when I made those comments Let me ask you a different question."
"17031050","17035930"," You ultimately bought Hulu from Comcast Yeah, but you said the following you said there are seven"
"17035930","17039810"," or eight platforms in the stream business alone That are in general entertainment that's a tough"
"17039810","17044890"," business to being competitively and it's not our strongest suit When I came back when I came back"
"17044890","17051570"," to the company And the company had been through a difficult time partially because of covid and the"
"17051570","17056370"," balance She wasn't as strong then it is much stronger now Then I would have liked it to have been"
"17056370","17062290"," I asked the question Do we write Comcast to check for what could be nine billion dollars or should"
"17062290","17063630"," we consider selling it to them?"
"17063630","17069330"," Is the business Unique enough valuable enough to us long term for us to write them the check and"
"17069330","17075230"," buy the whole thing or the opposite And I created a rigorous process Determine what is the right"
"17075230","17076390"," answer to that question?"
"17077130","17081910"," I worried that there was In general entertainment programming unlike Disney and Pixar and Marvel"
"17081910","17087950"," that it's not as differentiated Maybe not as valuable But then through this process determined that"
"17087950","17093630"," owning the whole thing had real value Because partnering that business with the other branded"
"17093630","17100110"," streaming businesses Plus could actually create a huge opportunity for us And thus we decided to"
"17100110","17102150"," keep it that and sell it Let me ask you about that IP. "
"17102450","17108610"," You just mentioned Pixar and Marvel and all and and some of these other things Very recently as"
"17108610","17113630"," you've seen because you get the box-up numbers every weekend A number of these films have not"
"17113630","17119990"," performed they have not performed the way they used to people question the creative magic at Disney"
"17121250","17123050"," You can look at the marvels."
"17123210","17129010"," I'm curious why you think that disappointed you could look at wish um Indiana Jones, what do you"
"17129010","17129130"," think?"
"17129330","17129750"," What's what's happened?"
"17130050","17133330"," Well, I think you have to look at it a couple of ways First of all, I think the movie"
"17133330","17141510"," movie business is changing actually um box office today is about 75% of what it was pre-covid I"
"17141510","17147810"," think we have conditioned the audience to to expect that These films will be on streaming platforms"
"17147810","17153890"," relatively quickly And that the experience of of accessing them and watching them in the home is"
"17153890","17159630"," better than it ever was One easier to access in terms of the technology Two just the just the"
"17159630","17166630"," visuals You know better sets in in your living room than than before And a bargain when you think"
"17166630","17171510"," about it streaming Disney Plus you can get for seven dollars a month That's a lot cheaper than"
"17171510","17176690"," taking your whole family to a film So I think the bar is now raised in terms of quality about"
"17176690","17182810"," what gets people out of their homes Into movie theaters some of it is just being part of basically"
"17182810","17188330"," the social wave Certainly barbie and op-and-himer did that for two other studios And so I think"
"17188330","17193930"," that's one thing second in our Particular case and specifically about those films some of those"
"17193930","17199490"," films they were not as good They were not as high in quality not everyone that you mentioned as"
"17200230","17205170"," Some of their predecessors our films and as they should have been particularly in this environment."
"17205230","17205990"," Why do you think it was?"
"17206970","17212350"," Well, the marvels was shot during covid there wasn't as much supervision on the set so to speak"
"17212350","17217790"," where we have executives there Really looking over what's being done day after day after day And"
"17217790","17222530"," that was a result of in mostly of covid, but at the same time we increased our output tremendously"
"17222530","17229630"," to feed The streaming platforms too much by the mistake Definite mistake the quality needs"
"17229630","17231490"," attention to deliver quality. "
"17231710","17237870"," It's not doesn't happen by accident And the quantity in our case diluted quality and marvels"
"17237870","17242390"," suffered greatly from that So there are different reasons and not be I'm the first I've been very"
"17242390","17248110"," public about it saying in back I would say right now my number one priority is to help the studio"
"17248110","17255910"," turn around creatively now Let's also put it in perspective We set the bar so high Year after year"
"17255910","17261170"," after year we had the best performance in the business probably for a decade And I'm not sure"
"17261170","17266710"," another studio will ever achieve some of the numbers that we achieved with Multiple I mean we got"
"17266710","17270850"," to the point where if I filmed into a billion dollars in global box office We were disappointed"
"17270850","17276170"," that's an unbelievably high standard And I think we have to get more realistic a couple of the"
"17276170","17281590"," films you mentioned By the way, which is interesting about kind of the new world order Did okay at"
"17281590","17282290"," the box office?"
"17282730","17287410"," Elementals a good example about 500 million at the box office by the way to some studios That would"
"17287410","17290510"," be a gigantic hit when disney is a 500 million dollar film."
"17290750","17296550"," It's a it's a failure Which is interesting, but then it went on it went on disney plus had massive"
"17296550","17302450"," consumption So that said something Maybe people didn't perceive it was the kind of film they needed"
"17302450","17307510"," to see in the theaters But they certainly when they discovered our disney plus enjoyed Let me ask"
"17307510","17310010"," you about this about franchises and the value of ip."
"17310390","17312790"," I don't think actually most people I have ever read this letter. "
"17313010","17318150"," So i'm going to read aloud if I could This was a letter written in 1966 by walt disney the"
"17318150","17321130"," man himself It was two months before dying from lung cancer."
"17321330","17326570"," He was this heavy smoker And he wrote this to shareholders about what he said makes us tick here at"
"17326570","17331610"," the disney organization Said many people have asked why don't you make another mary poppins?"
"17331930","17334310"," Well by nature, I'm a born experimenter to this day."
"17334430","17338130"," I don't believe in sequels I can't follow popular cycles. "
"17338690","17341750"," I have to move on to new things There are many new worlds to conquer as a matter of fact"
"17341750","17346570"," people have been asking us to make sequels ever since making mouse first became a star We have"
"17346570","17352250"," bowed only on one occasion to cry The cry to repeat ourselves back in the 30s though three little"
"17352250","17357670"," pigs was an enormous hit and the cry went out give us more pigs I can not see how we"
"17357670","17362190"," could possibly top pigs with pigs But we tried and I doubt whether any one of you reading this can"
"17362190","17366610"," name the other cartoons in which the pigs appeared We didn't make the same mistake with snow white"
"17366610","17371210"," when it was a huge hit the shot went up for more dwarfs top dwarfs dwarfs Why try?"
"17372010","17374450"," Right now we're not thinking about making another mary poppins."
"17374530","17379930"," We never will Perhaps there'll be other ventures with equal critical and financial success But we"
"17379930","17385710"," know we cannot hit a home run with the bases loaded every time we go to the plate We also"
"17385710","17391050"," know the only way we can even get to first base is by constantly going about and continuing to"
"17391050","17397110"," swing What would waltz think now I'm going to talk to him later."
"17397330","17405590"," I'll maybe I'll let you know I actually think about that a lot we about five years ago We put"
"17405590","17410850"," waltz back office back together again It's taken of everything including the order of the books on"
"17410850","17415690"," the shelves and we decided kind of as at a respect for him We would just return it to what"
"17415690","17420790"," it looked like then interesting you mentioned he was a smoker It's filled with ashtrays wherever"
"17420790","17424910"," you go There's an ashtray and every once in a while I go in not to smoke by the way"
"17424910","17429150"," I don't smoke but I go into his office Just to sort of sort of feel the presence. "
"17429350","17434650"," I know that sounds a little weird but it's kind of a nice way to relax and and Appreciate the"
"17434650","17440350"," legacy of the company and the first thing you really realize if you study waltz is that walt was"
"17441550","17445330"," Unbelievable at adapting to change First of all, he loved technology."
"17445330","17451010"," He loved to use technology And he also knew that the world was not a static place That was true"
"17451010","17451730"," for his team parks."
"17451990","17456670"," That was true for his movies for television everything that he did He was a true innovator and"
"17456670","17461950"," innovator is someone who never stands still now when that quote I think you would want to get me"
"17461950","17467410"," read it to me and I think we had just done the sequel to very tough Wow, this is good"
"17467410","17474410"," timing I think I don't want to apologize for making sequels. "
"17474910","17480650"," Some of them have done extraordinarily well And they've been good films too I think you have there"
"17480650","17486070"," has to be a reason to make them you have to have a good story And often the story doesn't"
"17486070","17490890"," hold up to if there's not as strong as the original story that could be a problem But it just"
"17490890","17496150"," has to have a reason you have to have a reason to make it beyond commerce There has to be"
"17496150","17500570"," it has to there has to be an artistic reason to make it And we've made too many."
"17500990","17505270"," It doesn't mean we're not going to continue to make them We're we're making a number of them now"
"17505270","17511590"," right as a matter of fact Including to some of our best films, but we will only greenlight a sequel"
"17511590","17516690"," if we believe the story that the creators want to tell is worth Do you think then you can make"

"17787630","17793650"," consumer without sacrificing margin So that's how we characterize it as winners can be subjective."
"17794470","17800350"," I think on the other hand There were some laggards for the data in our check um In that included"

"17866870","17871230"," or does it mean that maybe these retailers have stuff left to do for the rest of the season?"
"17872430","17876890"," Yeah, I mean it's a great point on where the consumer stands and I think this is the first time"

"18171550","18177190"," We had this tweezer I want to show you this tweezer right here just four technicals. "
"18177190","18182470"," So can't appear right squeezed up here And this is pretty bullish right here, right?"
"18182730","18190110"," Come back check for a squeeze up And when I want to point your point your attention to is when"
"18190110","18198210"," we drew these bars over here earlier today that When we we squeeze up right back over the hourly"
"18198210","18205050"," trigger Come back down confirm the hourly trigger Right and the expectation pretend none of this"
"18205050","18208950"," has happened yet Say and just make that maybe black or something like that."
"18208950","18218980"," I don't know I Just pretend oh no, sorry Here Come"
"18218980","18230080"," on Pretend uh none of this is here None of this is here either and all this right here And"
"18230080","18234900"," none of this action is here yet Okay None of this action is here."
"18235020","18241470"," Well, this is what I want to show you The reason that we put these the reason that we drop"
"18241470","18245450"," these bars here This is any time frame one minute five minute half hour. "
"18245870","18253650"," This can be two monthly doesn't matter what bars you're looking at what does matter is That when"
"18253650","18258610"," you have the recovery up here, right on any trigger Right we come down."
"18258870","18259990"," We we come back."
"18260210","18267030"," We actually retested the half hour trigger Immediately when that happens you put these bars up"
"18267030","18275570"," right here or I do And the reason being is you're looking to see if buyers still have interest So"
"18275570","18281830"," the expectation would be that you squeeze up and you make you can make just that little high right"
"18281830","18288030"," there Even if it comes back And then makes that little high right there or if it just goes straight"
"18288030","18293230"," up and makes the new high That's showing the demand is there to go even higher. "
"18293610","18300710"," Okay Now If you remember earlier when we had this uh tweezer here and then this tweezer here and an"
"18300710","18307950"," immediate reversal to the downside This is telling you automatically that buyers are not here and"
"18307950","18314990"," if you look at the further Such uh price action in here You can see that there's no demand right"
"18314990","18319170"," no demand no demand no demand and we're like hey We're waiting for beige book right."
"18319250","18322370"," What does beige book do beige book is a neutral?"
"18322510","18324510"," It's not hawkish not bullish."
"18324650","18331530"," It's nothing And the hedge stays on the market and the buyers have disappeared It's very important"
"18331530","18332710"," to see that buyers. "
"18333370","18337890"," This is this was it right here This was the moment where you knew that the demand to go up"
"18337890","18343050"," left the market And then when beige book came out and it was a neutral there was no reason to"
"18343050","18346350"," go up here And there was no reason to blast down over here."
"18346510","18351670"," It's just neutral right And you don't have demand at this point to do anything and what's going on"
"18351670","18355730"," into the clothes here Just drag down right drag down."
"18356010","18356970"," Nobody wants to buy anything. "
"18357410","18362390"," Nobody wants to play in the market The moves were made for the day and the dealers like this as"
"18362390","18367590"," well The dealers already have to pay out the puts of the calls And they want nothing more than to"
"18367590","18372330"," destroy all of this destroy puts even though you get a put print down here Not like you would have"
"18372330","18374010"," you got a big blast down here, right?"
"18374010","18378810"," They killed a bunch of the premium in the puts these puts were pretty expensive over here So even"
"18378810","18383350"," if they pay down here, they're not paying what they would have paid back here Does that make sense"
"18383350","18383730"," to you?"
"18384170","18389210"," So you can see that action and now we're trading all the way down to this close over here If"
"18389210","18395610"," you had seen This trade come up and catch that first one even if it pulled back It wouldn't have"
"18395610","18401150"," mattered it still would have sick or it or it still would have lent A hint that we're going to"
"18401150","18407290"," continue to go higher and higher and trade all this stuff back here So you're seeing the will of"
"18407290","18413630"," buyers leaving the market here Just watch how the will and this clothes is down to nothing here"
"18414110","18420450"," Now, I'm not expecting much to happen into this clothes on this gamma bar You'd really have you"
"18420450","18426430"," need real money selling To get some kind of like real true bloodbath you might get a little bit of"
"18426430","18433070"," weakness down here Right, but it'll squeeze right back up to that 45 50 So any kind of weakness in"
"18433070","18439130"," here on this gamma bar is going to be short-lived unless you get real money selling real money"
"18439130","18444510"," selling Is what you're looking for for this here to stick Big big big selling."
"18444710","18451770"," So anyway I'm not expecting too much now into this close You see hyg pulled back there to the gamma"
"18451770","18458810"," bar You also saw dixie squeezing higher and you actually see for the first time in some Sometime"
"18458810","18463990"," vix is starting to at least bottom If you if you were to go in a five-minute chart on"
"18463990","18466910"," vix You can see a flattening action on vix."
"18467130","18472670"," So this actually looks kind of bullish for our bullish for vix and bearish For bullish for vix and"
"18472670","18474990"," bearish for s&p 500. "
"18475470","18477090"," So maybe we'll see a little bit of blood tomorrow."
"18477170","18483510"," It's possible Apple coming right back down to its squeeze right down to where we closed yesterday"
"18483510","18489090"," So the big squeeze and apple all the way back down dixie looking bullish right now ndx coming down"
"18489090","18496510"," now below 16,000 I think it's trading 984 but I don't have one minute chart that's still flat at"
"18496510","18503490"," 16,000 So just keep that in mind as we come into this close here No trade forming to this"
"18503490","18503670"," bell."
"18503870","18508590"," I don't want to take any trades here I don't see anything here into this close that is I don't"
"18508590","18513570"," see anything in this close that is uh, oh, I turned that off I'm gonna put that might put that"

"18520000","18525660"," That's like yeah by the like buy this close for a squeeze up tomorrow Anything like that it would"
"18525660","18530500"," be it would not shock me at all to see this shit get pinned With a hedge on the market"
"18530500","18536880"," for the news to drop you you could trade this in futures tomorrow Uh before the bell at 8 30,"
"18537060","18542200"," but otherwise I'm not going I'm going to expect a flat overnight just sideways into overnight"
"18542940","18545840"," Anticipating uh that that news that's coming out tomorrow."
"18545860","18550760"," And I'll be honest with you guys I'm not expecting any bad news tomorrow morning."
"18550900","18555000"," I'm not expecting anything like doom and gloom on friday and none of that kind of stuff It's gonna"
