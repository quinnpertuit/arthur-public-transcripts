"3894780","3899200"," And more than likely though price doesn't uh, go straight down So even though it's breaking through"
"3899200","3900300"," right now, maybe it does."
"3900460","3904860"," I don't know maybe it's that much of a sell but Uh, normally you'll get a prite or a whole"

"4131170","4137720"," have more probably have more down to go Yeah, not in the five minute. "
"4138080","4144200"," So Uh, we could have a snapback rally, but there's there's a good potential of so just heads up out"
"4144200","4150020"," there if you're both Probably so probably getting a snapback rally right here Uh, not snapback"
"4150020","4150240"," rally."
"4150479","4151880"," I would call it more of just a snapback."
"4152080","4159340"," So likely gonna get a snapback at this moment So i'm trying to watch this here, but Uh, bears have"
"4159340","4161439"," a good chance of taking this much lower. "
"4161580","4167979"," So um Damn it fucking color this fucking thing."
"4168279","4175399"," I hate fucking windows 11 right now Um The could bears still have a fair chance on the hourly at"
"4175399","4182540"," least Uh to get one more tag lower at least one more tag lower So if you're a bull, this"
"4182540","4189399"," is probably not the dip for you to buy You could possibly buy this from right now to Uh, wherever"
"4189399","4194560"," this white line is this one minute, but bears Look, this doesn't look like the book the dip to buy"
"4194560","4202020"," for bulls just to heads up Uh on the at least on the hourly until Probably 11 30 bears are"
"4202020","4208020"," probably in charge here Uh, so don't be buying this dip thinking it's going straight to the moon"
"4208020","4213540"," like this is the dip to buy And we also have this uh, this this low right here that hasn't"
"4213540","4223540"," been tagged yet We'll tag this one right here The low of the day To"
"4223540","4233860"," watch out for this one at 409 52 But"

"4238340","4245210"," some momentum on their sides Uh to go to go further down here That's so much in the five minute"
"4245210","4258200"," on the hourly they do Chase,"
"4258460","4259500"," what do you mean you lost your job?"

"4297110","4306840"," a bearish day Or they get the bearish day, but they want the bearish week"
"4315280","4317640"," Now you want an apple price target of the lord of the downside?"

"4324880","4330180"," Let me give you a target on the low for apple Uh, a low side target for apple would be"
"4330180","4334060"," 145 93 Uh, but likely it's higher."
"4334300","4337520"," It's like 147 ish on apple."

"7998240","8008200"," to you right now Now one of the things that we're not seeing is price"
"8008800","8017900"," Uh, we're not seeing price here Uh, follow breadth down and I want you to wait and see what I'm"
"8017900","8024660"," what explain to you quickly what i'm talking about here Um So you can see this little dip right"
"8024660","8032880"," here and Can make this a one point Okay, so if you just look here, you can see follow my"
"8032880","8038300"," cursor down and you'll see that uh breadth came down breadth came down and price wasn't following"
"8039200","8049180"," And uh my point here and price not following doing there this out things this Fairs really"
"8049180","8049920"," need acceleration."
"8050360","8051160"," They're not getting it right."
"8051300","8056520"," They're not getting down with price acceleration Uh, so just not getting this we say and change"
"8056520","8061340"," this back to a different color here And they need this like if you're a bear you need to see"
"8062040","8071080"," You need to see price acceleration at some point And by not seeing price acceleration Uh, it's it's"
"8071080","8078700"," uh, it's still bullish right Um, so you need to see some kind of price acceleration on a downside"
"8078700","8087260"," move And And we're not seeing it in the example in the past is uh, that that means we have"
"8087260","8094920"," less volatility overall Um So if you look back here Uh, when we had these we had we had huge"
"8094920","8103880"," price acceleration Uh as breadth went down right, uh, so price Uh, velocity on a downward move. "
"8104000","8109620"," We're not seeing Uh, even right now we're not seeing it Now you're actually seeing dip buyers"
"8109620","8117320"," stepping in right now in the market Uh, currently they're trying to buy this dip right now And uh,"
"8117440","8122720"," to see some of that price velocity on the downside Uh, bears really want to see this this some key"
"8122720","8128480"," places for bears to look out for I'm gonna give you two of them right now Uh, what bears are"
"8128480","8138420"," looking for um And they're looking to break, uh 40351, uh, we'll write that we'll we'll"
"8138420","8150620"," do a, I'll do a small 40351, it's right in here This"
"8150620","8152200"," is the car like in trade, right?"
"8152620","8159120"," Bears bears need to Uh get underneath this 40351 right here."
"8159180","8169900"," That's step one And then bears need to get under 39730 It's"
"8169900","8171180"," not really that far down."
"8171700","8175580"," I'm not to be honest with you That says Jim really wants to buy this right here. "
"8175940","8189000"," It's like 39730 Um on a five day chart We can look at this here 39730"
"8189000","8195559"," and 396 like I say that I want to buy this down here To be truthful with you a bear"
"8195559","8204540"," needs to, um See some price acceleration like one to three days down here need to get underneath"
"8204540","8212320"," this 403 right They want to not just tag this right But they want to get underneath like with"
"8212320","8219500"," velocity they want to get push right like bloodbath down Right with price, uh going faster than"
"8219500","8225520"," breath And then hold underneath this 396 for another move lower This is where the real big bear"
"8225520","8232219"," trade is down here Is like a break and hold of 396 Uh, and then even it doesn't matter because"
"8232219","8237219"," as long as as long as the um Uh all this bear stuff can come to spare momentum come down"
"8237219","8242440"," and meet back up with it Down below they can get lower pricing like that 3600 and stuff like that"
"8242940","8248959"," Uh, but it's not showing itself right now Right You guys remember when we you guys I know most of"
"8248959","8253040"," you guys at this point at least we're in the bear market of 2022 right I mean look at this"
"8253040","8253840"," movement right now."
"8253840","8263219"," We we know We know that when we're in a bear market or at least bearish behavior This is bearish"
"8263219","8272600"," behavior, uh, but not like Uh 2022 you guys remember 2022 is like right it was like no breath Are"
"8272600","8275959"," not breath with a D But like for a bull there was no breath."
"8276040","8281660"," It was like I mean this was like fucking nine to 1130. "
"8281799","8288540"," It was like wam Wham and then wam right and then once given one more one more slam into the"
"8288540","8291020"," clothes Then we wake up the next morning too, right?"
"8291780","8296480"," You guys already remember this stuff right we think blast down we take out 403 like it was nothing"
"8297180","8305240"," You get one little breather into the clothes and then we beat down at 396 Open next day right get"
"8305240","8313750"," a little breather Get a little breather and then uh It'd be down down below 396 with conviction,"
"8313750","8323740"," right It would just be down down down down three straight days of it sometimes took"
"8323740","8330440"," five if it took five days The other fucking two were like sideways and underneath known resistance"
"8330440","8337240"," or known support that was turned into resistance Uh, so if you're a bear, that's what you want to"
"8337240","8342860"," see You're looking for that behavior Uh of the market right now."
"8342959","8349280"," So far we haven't seen it Even on our ugliest days since october Uh, we haven't seen it right"
"8349799","8350959"," Remember there was some days."
"8351120","8354860"," I think in this way like right do you guys remember in like october in december?"
"8355080","8362230"," We'd have like a bloodbath And that's my point here is Now, let's say you see a bloodbath, right?"
"8363270","8365610"," Let's say you see this bloodbath down to this 396. "
"8366389","8372230"," Let's say we just bloodbath it down Right straight down So as a barrier like oh, yeah, we go to"
"8372230","8373549"," this close and wake up tomorrow morning."
"8373730","8378830"," We should bloodbath it some more And we're still not seeing that velocity priced down and then the"
"8378830","8385709"," continuation of velocity on the downside Um, like momentum, right?"
"8387690","8393750"," Selling right relentless selling Um So you really need what you are going to be watching for that"
"8393750","8394150"," as a barrier."
"8394170","8397210"," You don't want to be seeing Uh, this kind of stuff. "
"8397590","8404490"," I mean you want to see this is bearish, but not bearish Like Uh chases saying chases like I need"
"8404490","8405070"," to be down 20."
"8405150","8407730"," We need to be down 20 right now Right."

"8416110","8425210"," under for I think it's 406 zero That's all they need to be under So it's not like they need"
"8425210","8429310"," to be under I mean they would like to be at 3600, but there's no need for them to be"
"8432450","8439930"," Like their their heads doesn't require that to happen Uh, and even icons trade over here Uh, he"
"8439930","8447670"," doesn't need it to be at 3000 or 2800 Anything like that either And if anything, this is just"
"8447670","8448070"," though."
"8448230","8450010"," This is a magnet for the market, right?"
"8451690","8453410"," About to stop it from going any higher."

"8607030","8616390"," 30 currently 395 62 Um, and then uh from there you want to hold underneath there to try to get"
"8616390","8621470"," those really low numbers That's the big trade right down to 360 or three or three three zero six"
"8621470","8630830"," zero Um, right now those right now, uh, that momentum is coming up like a shark underneath Uh, so"
"8630830","8633010"," bears aren't getting any any leverage here, right?"

"8714380","8724020"," Now this chart is a x nx Uh Think conspicuous Chart but it's really neat"
"8727800","8737620"," I'm gonna mute my camera real quick here And I want to show you guys some neat I So if"
"8737620","8744400"," you look closely at this chart it kind of looks like a chart you're familiar with To me what I"
"8744400","8755100"," see here is um I see something really neat here It's almost looks to me So"
"8755100","8765340"," if you're if you're looking at uh this spy It's kind of It's kind of looks like uh january of"
"8765340","8784070"," 2021 or 2022 excuse me And uh Here"
"8784070","8794620"," let me show you this one here kind of neat And"
"8794620","8801410"," I want to show you this part of it right here I want to show you this part of it"
"8801410","8807350"," right here and the reason i'm saying this because Um, you see how they get the new new high new"
"8807350","8814030"," high right Start grinding higher grinding higher looks like cup and handle almost right And then"
"8814030","8820370"," you're grinding higher that at some point you start going sideways you blast down Dip by back up"
"8820370","8834200"," right and you can actually see something like this You can actually see something like this You"
"8834200","8841940"," can actually see something like this play out multiple times this year Until they finally announce"
"8841940","8850280"," rates uh Being a cut or pause or their front run the last of the rates and then you see"
"8850280","8856280"," the last blast down Okay, so i'm going to look at this chart because this chart's really"
"8856280","8856700"," fascinating. "
"8856900","8862400"," Um, so like a whip wick off kind of a thing And what's really neat about this is it almost"
"8862400","8871700"," looks like a spy chart so The idea would be see this see this one right here It's kind of"
"8871700","8877180"," like this one right here, right And you had the fed rate decision And you see you had the favorite"
"8877180","8878280"," the fed rate decision."
"8878580","8882780"," They said no, we're gonna keep uh keep adding or we're not done yet with rates, right?"
"8883260","8888400"," So it's like oh fuck it then we're gonna keep going up And we'll do it again and we'll do"
"8888400","8889740"," it again grind up."
"8889760","8890460"," We'll do it again. "
"8890700","8894200"," We'll grind up We'll do it again until they announce those final rates then you get that last blast"
"8894200","8901660"," down Right Some kind of something like that, right Um, so you could actually buy these are all"
"8901660","8904720"," bible dips and then the last bloodbath down here."
"8904940","8911320"," So let me just show it to you One more time so you can see it See how you get"
"8911320","8916300"," this one right here and then you get the last bloodbath This is your trough, right?"
"8918360","8923620"," You have your trough down here Some of you guys follow me on at captain's alpha I talked to you"
"8923620","8928520"," about the trough and then the capitulation move that eventually takes place at some point Not"
"8928520","8933840"," always but oftentimes you'll see that one quick capitulation move So if you're buying the dips down"
"8933840","8941080"," here The one key point I would talk to you about if you're buying these dips down here Right And"
"8941080","8947040"," you're like well, we're not in a bull market yet And we might get We might get this one last"
"8947040","8952300"," rip lower mike wilson talks about this right Because I confirm my belief we're gonna get that one"
"8952300","8957200"," last rip down below The only note that I made on that cat captain's alpha that people especially"
"8957200","8965600"," bears don't want to talk about Is that you can buy this stuff down here Right you can buy this"
"8965600","8972780"," stuff down here And you can hedge above Right you hedge this make some money on your hedge on your"
"8972780","8978840"," on your lungs that you have down here And My people have been to it will be like well, yeah,"
"8979040","8979500"," but what about that?"
"8979860","8981980"," You should have waited until you timed it perfectly."
"8982360","8983220"," I'm like number one. "
"8983540","8991520"," No one times shit perfectly You got bears out there that call fucking roll over what for 16"
"8991520","8996380"," straight months until they finally get one Meanwhile, they were wrong the entire time, right?"
"8997280","9002860"," Um So my point though is this is that if you're buying these dips down below along the way The"
"9002860","9008220"," bottom that's the bottom of the trough but the trough itself And then you're hedging the tops above"
"9008220","9012820"," with hedging To make some money right so you make some money on this one you make some money on"
"9012820","9019320"," that one You make some money on this one Uh, the key point though here is this Is that last"
"9019320","9024620"," capitulation moment that you have this last bloodbath whenever that takes place Whether it's in"
"9024620","9032300"," march whether it's in july whether it's in december Uh, the time frame on it is very brief So if"
"9032300","9037920"," you were buying all these dips down below here, right and you have that one capitulation moment the"
"9037920","9043340"," time frame look at the time frame in this this is uh So if you'd been buying all this back"
"9043340","9050880"," here Right you have that last capitulation moment this time frame in this one is uh may sixth to uh"
"9050880","9058300"," May 20th And even on the spa you can look back in history And you would have just all along"
"9058300","9066160"," been buying this stuff Right buying this stuff Uh, sunk calls put buying head just making money on"
"9066160","9069760"," the headside And just like that two three years later."
"9069760","9077520"," You never you never actually lost anything so Uh, even in here as a matter of fact, you could have"
"9077520","9083220"," added down here right and got a dca down here and been just fine Uh and traded this all along"
"9083220","9088890"," the way And so that's kind of where we are in the spa right you kind of like When you"
"9088890","9098830"," look at the spa Or spx See how it kind"
"9098830","9103530"," of looks like the same kind of a thing over here Right kind of seeing that same kind of a"
"9103530","9109890"," thing right you kind of seeing that idea that we grind up here push back down grind up here push"
"9109890","9115230"," back down and you might get that one last bloodbath down here But all along the way if you've been"
"9115230","9123230"," buying these dips buying these dips Right and you're hedging above here Even if we have one quick"
"9123230","9128170"," rip up to 4600 doesn't really matter You're just hedging you're buying these dips all along the"
"9128170","9128410"," way."
"9128470","9135690"," You have to change your um, you have to change your your stance from uh bearishness to Even if it's"
"9135690","9145470"," a low like even if it's a low over here Here 3100 32 200 3800 really 2800 Doesn't really matter"
"9146390","9151410"," Doesn't really matter as long as you're as long as at some point So you get the ugly over here,"
"9151650","9151670"," right?"
"9152250","9156930"," Doesn't really matter the only because especially if you get that last little blast down It's"
"9156930","9159310"," typically it's typically quick. "
"9159350","9160130"," It's like boom."
"9160490","9160870"," Boom."
"9161150","9161890"," You're backed up again. "

"16038210","16047330"," the uh hourly here We would have uh, it wouldn't be as Uh bullish right now."
"16047410","16049810"," We didn't did we we stayed above here. "
"16049830","16056950"," We held the one held the one recheck the five And then came back up to check on high again"
"16058270","16067810"," Now but to that point though as we're trading this one minute And You see that Uh, the one minute"
"16067810","16069610"," is not rolling over down here, right?"
"16070230","16079250"," It gives time for momentum from underneath to come up Right more momentum is coming from underneath"
"16079250","16088470"," and uh, so the more time that's fought for uh, the more time that gets fought for Uh, this is"

"16111970","16114670"," the bottom right as your as your as your trigger, right?"
"16114830","16119870"," You got to move higher off the green You got to move higher off the green And right here you"
"16119870","16123970"," got to move higher off the green And so the more time that you buy this green line is coming"
"16123970","16126430"," up And this red line is coming up."
"16126490","16131230"," So you're going to get a reaction at some point and it's likely going to be higher Uh, not lower,"
"16131590","16131730"," right?"
"16132030","16137010"," As long as we stay above the one the five and the green line And so the longer we stay"
"16137010","16143490"," here Right, you see how what the reaction was the last time remaining now for the takes release"
"16143490","16148870"," from fetch Williams Since the time came down just the reaction of the red was we're going higher So"
"16148870","16154610"," even if we even if we don't come down here Uh, you're going to eventually see this red come up"
"16154610","16158330"," and you're going to see this blue come up And then you're going to force price higher until we"
"16158330","16163010"," until we meet sellers We know we had sellers above here earlier at 41350. "
"16163130","16167670"," We had sellers above there were known sellers back here at 415 35, right?"
"16168090","16176650"," We know what the implied move is uh heading into tomorrow so So with all that said, right Uh the"
"16176650","16179790"," 41350 we know that there's some sellers here, right?"
"16180990","16190110"," Or we we kind of knew that there were some sellers right here Right weak sellers 10 seconds You"
"16194490","16195430"," know they're right here."
"16195510","16196850"," They don't want to give this up, right?"

"16277520","16285000"," right here Okay, so they've got strong buyers at 4 11 15 Uh, and then you've got these this news"
"16285000","16289400"," broadcast saying oh we're weak right now in the market But you really not so you can't see it on"
"16289400","16295980"," this chart, but there are strong buyers hiding down below right now And you know that the sellers"
"16295980","16318500"," here are weak and you know that the sellers above are strong at 4 15 50 These"
"16318500","16323240"," are strong sellers above these are weak sellers down here and these are strong buyers down here now"
"16323240","16329540"," We just had some fed comments right And we know these strong buyers are here now if these strong"
"16329540","16334060"," buyers disappear right this the drug poll goes away And we're left with weak buyers."
"16334580","16338460"," We'll start blasting through Right, but they're not gone at the moment. "
"16338640","16339280"," They're just right here."
"16339480","16343780"," They're actually buying all of this up right now These are strong buyers down here."
"16343860","16351280"," I'll show you where they are Uh, they're sitting right here I want you to see them right here Can"
"16351280","16357260"," we know what the reaction is when we get down here Now that we squeeze higher we squeeze higher Uh,"
"16357320","16362680"," so the longer that we spend over here Uh, we have weak buyers and we're looking for a reaction off"
"16362680","16366860"," of this green line Now if the if the buyers disappear right here, right?"
"16367020","16368580"," We'll start to bloodbath this down. "
"16368680","16369380"," Does that make sense?"
"16372280","16378780"," Excuse me So right here you're gonna expect buyers to step in strong ones right where we are right"
"16378780","16385180"," now I think that's that maybe being extended here is the S&P 500 down to almost a spot four"
"16385180","16392419"," percent now four eleven fifteen Right, so four eleven fifteen is where these strong buyers are"
"16392419","16392820"," right here."
"16392900","16397460"," You expect these guys to step in Earlier, they're way down here."
"16397680","16399099"," They're way down here. "
"16399320","16399380"," Now."
"16399619","16404680"," They're right here Are ready to buy right so if you're like, okay, I know that there's all right or"
"16404680","16411439"," at least assume That there's strong buyers just below me Uh, so your question would be would you"
"16411439","16414000"," have a sell and if you had a sell where would it be?"
"16414460","16418840"," It's looking to an analyst note by Just looking to the market moves for today's session again a"
"16418840","16423700"," note from analysts here To your stock mix and the two-year treasury yield added more than 10 basis"
"16423700","16428340"," points after day to show that inflation does remain elevated As the CPI came out hot this morning"
"16428340","16433119"," In the aftermath two federal reserve officials warned that the remedy could mean higher interest"
"16433119","16439080"," rates for longer But one policymakers suggested that the finishing line might be in sight It's also"
"16439080","16444119"," citing these swap contracts which showed investors now give near even odds for a quarter point rate"
"16444119","16450099"," hike in the fed's june meeting Following similar hikes in march and may to the rate sensitive to"
"16450099","16455300"," your yield rose past four spot six percent It has surged this month driven by a blowout job support"
"16455300","16461080"," and Fed officials making it clear that they intend to push rates toward five percent if not higher"
"16464340","16466840"," Well, I was thinking I got someone sent me a text."
"16467360","16480619"," I'm an attorney to text me right now I want to make sure that I'm in the I want to"
"16480619","16533800"," make sure that I've got this right Just"
"16533800","16534279"," sitting here. "
"16534580","16543580"," So when you're looking at this chart over here, right You're looking at this chart over here,"
"16543820","16543840"," right?"
"16544040","16549040"," You can tell you've got strong buyers here You've got okay buyers here and you've got weak buyers"
"16549040","16554480"," above here Is the point that I'm trying to make to the you know where the sellers are above already"
"16554480","16558520"," where you're assuming where the sellers are So if you didn't have these strong buyers, let's just"
"16558520","16562140"," say these guys were gone Or that or that line wasn't there."
"16562480","16564640"," Let's just say this wasn't a line right here, right?"
"16564980","16567759"," You would know that you'd have to have your cells here or here."
"16567919","16568500"," Does that make sense?"
"16569080","16575740"," So because if these strong buyers are way down here Finish down here If you knew that these strong"
"16575740","16583080"," buyers were actually down here Right, you would know that this dip right here would fail Down to"
"16583080","16583279"," here. "
"16583279","16583960"," Does that make sense?"
"16584619","16589860"," So you would actually fail that the dip buy would would fail down here Uh, and you would have you"
"16589860","16595099"," would lower your cell you would lower raise your cells up here Because you already know you've got"
"16595099","16596419"," strong buyers right here."
"16596599","16599240"," Your your cell trigger is lower."
"16599439","16606439"," Does that make sense Weak buyers here Right weak buyers here, but you know that the strong buyers"
"16606439","16607540"," are not down here. "
"16607540","16610759"," You know that they're right here Makes sense."
"16611200","16616119"," So if you didn't have this these strong buyers that you knew about or assuming are there Uh, you"
"16616119","16617800"," would you would have a cell much higher, right?"
"16617960","16622259"," You'd have your cell on this white line You'd have your cell on this red line Right because you"
"16622259","16628740"," already know that these buyers are here Right, it tells you that you can go lower Uh, then where"
"16628740","16634400"," those strong buyers are your cell would be down here makes sense And you know that you have weak"
"16634400","16639980"," sellers still above so no longer that you spend here The longer that you spend on this white line"
"16639980","16648480"," and this red line here So the more time it gives you To force these buyers higher and higher and"
"16648480","16650759"," higher So they're sitting right here."
"16650759","16651439"," Does that make sense?"
"16652619","16655960"," So I know this dip is not going to get sold. "
"16656259","16657060"," Does that make sense to you?"
"16657560","16664279"," Oh, there you guys understand all this And the longer time we're spending here the more time I know"
"16664279","16668320"," that it's going to take for these strong buyers to get here and I already know that this test down"
"16668320","16672880"," below We'll get bought no matter what the news is saying no matter what the new squawk is saying"
"16673460","16674000"," None of that."
"16674259","16678439"," I know that this thing going nowhere but they're here right now And you can actually see that in"
"16678439","16683660"," real time that these strong buyers were here That this dip wouldn't fail."
"16684220","16686300"," Okay, this dip didn't fail. "
"16686500","16692939"," We knew it wouldn't fail And we knew that this would get bought So when you're making a decision of"
"16694040","16695300"," Shit, are we gonna sell here?"
"16695460","16695779"," Oh shit."
"16695919","16702060"," This looks like a bear flag here You actually know that it's not a bear flag you actually know that"
"16702060","16709540"," the buyers were back here moving up higher and higher And now they're hiding right here Okay But we"
"16709540","16713340"," do know that these sellers are weak right because we know where the we know where the previous"
"16713340","16718060"," sellers are right here's the previous sellers We already we already took a dent out of them, right?"
"16718279","16722820"," We already we already got rid of some of these sellers and our next big block of sellers is up"
"16722820","16724560"," here somewhere So it could actually be right here."
"16724720","16731500"," You should make the big case that strong sellers are right here Makes sense And the longer that we"
"16731500","16737360"," spend here with strong buyers, they're gonna push And they're gonna push and they're gonna push"
"16737360","16743119"," until they consume the weak sellers or the strong sellers come down Or they'll push until we get up"
"16743119","16749540"," here To these two groups meet buyers and sellers That makes sense You guys all understand in that"
"16749540","16756259"," so some people are asking a text message We kind of cool to have this labeled like this right like"
"16756259","16765869"," weak buyers strong buyers Strong sellers weak sellers that kind of stuff You guys understand"
"16771009","16779570"," How do I know there's strong buyers on another screener on my side here I can see them On a"
"16779570","16785190"," tool that I have in the background that we've been developing I can see where they are on the on"
"16785190","16790770"," the chart As a matter of fact, they have just moved up again. "
"16791210","16800340"," So the strong buyers are now Another right here They're sitting right here still They just moved"
"16800340","16804480"," all the way up over the past half an hour and the longer time that you give these The longer"
"16804480","16810100"," time that you give the strong buyers here's an example Earlier the strong buyers are right here"
"16811780","16816540"," They weren't right here right so right here the strong buyers were not right here."
"16816540","16824200"," They were down here still And if we when we had sold here Right if they were able to get"
"16824200","16831260"," through we would have blood out does that make sense, but we didn't We held the one minute and what"
"16831260","16838240"," that shows that we actually have strong buyers right here too right And now that's the thing about"
"16838240","16845000"," having like two or three fighters up here And you have more and more fighters coming to join And"
"16845000","16849840"," now they're right here and I got four fighters Right you know weak buyers, but you got strong"
"16849840","16854600"," buyers and weak buyers now together And they're not going to give this up Right and these sellers"
"16854600","16859280"," right here have already been worn down above here So these these weak sellers that we know are"
"16859280","16863160"," right here are going to get they're going to get destroyed at some point Unless these strong"
"16863160","16864040"," sellers have come down."
"16864180","16869420"," We just don't see them right So we're going to we're going to trade higher here And look to take"
"16869420","16876120"," out these weak sellers until we can get up to 414 Make sense so I know I can buy this"
"16876120","16881120"," dip right here where this looks to like your classic loop charting Uh, you might be like, oh, yeah,"
"16881220","16887980"," we're gonna we're gonna bleed out right here Right, we're gonna Gonna go like this and that's gonna"
"16887980","16892380"," be the bloodbath down here some kind of nonsense like that Sometimes you do right sometimes you do"
"16892380","16897220"," sometimes you don't but if you already know that they're here waiting Uh, this makes a great dip by"
"16897220","16901960"," a great ad place to add Right, so let's say you were long right here and you wanted to add"
"16901960","16906900"," down here and you know that they're sitting here Great place to add to a position to go higher too,"
"16907000","16925110"," right to join these strong buyers Makes sense Magic"
"16925110","16930070"," indicator says that they're strong buyers right here now you know what else is cool about this too"
"16930570","16939710"," Is that these strong buyers They'll sometimes come up like this And then sometimes they go like"
"16939710","16950050"," this Can actually see them going away Um, so if they go away, I'll know it Do"
"16950050","16951170"," I see them go away?"
"16951490","16954610"," They'll start coming down just like this believe it or not and you'd be like, oh shit where we"
"16954610","16954790"," going?"
"16955330","16961710"," And that's showing that price is going up while support is weakening So even though price is higher"
"16962170","16966070"," You're gonna think that you're you'll know ahead of time that it's gonna fail because these these"
"16966070","16975970"," strong buyers have disappeared Right now they haven't disappeared still there Big buyers have"
"16975970","16983790"," now moved up And the strong buyers are down below Now does that mean we closed at a high here?"
"16983950","16984610"," I don't know yet. "
"16984970","16989130"," I'm still sitting in calls right now They're grinding them the fuck down on me right now I'm a"
"16989130","16990150"," little pissy about this."
"16990450","16995090"," This is the dealers And the background and they're trying to burn all the calls they possibly can't"
"16995090","16999390"," even if they go up here into the close Now so if we get on a high here, I'm probably"
"16999390","17005130"," gonna sell At flat at some point right we're gonna come back up and see these weak sellers above"

"19027740","19030880"," to be made if it can't be made we'll probably roll over here This does look like they're gonna"
"19030880","19039800"," trade it sideways into the bell at least looks like it But the truth is here There's probably We"
"19039800","19046940"," have some vault tomorrow, but not really until thursday It wouldn't surprise me to see us trade"
"19046940","19053320"," sideways through through wednesday It wouldn't surprise me to see right now a bunch of theta gang"

"19071460","19077060"," wide butterfly And what they'll do is they'll capture that They'll capture that through tomorrow."
"19077060","19081880"," There's a high probability not guaranteed, but but a couple things there's a couple things Uh,"
"19083040","19084180"," there's well first off. "

"19098020","19104380"," There's there's a far out chance That because we have such a tight trading range that we could get"
"19104380","19112220"," something unexpected tomorrow Uh that would send us outside of our expected range tomorrow So In"
"19112220","19117620"," reality, there's like a wide butterfly in here that that seems rational into the closed tomorrow"
"19117620","19122420"," until we get a some range expansion on thursday Uh, the other thing that you could do is throw"
"19122420","19128200"," lotos at a high that's unexpected tomorrow And maybe at the bell you could throw 420 seas And like"
"19128200","19129160"," 404 peas."
"19129600","19135660"," I don't know what they cost right now I'm assuming that they're dirt fucking cheap So let's look at"

"19142340","19143540"," No one's expecting it now."
"19143700","19151300"," I wouldn't say by 10 cents, but you could also do like a 407s Uh for 26 cents you could"
"19151300","19155580"," also take on 420s for like 10 cents."
"19155680","19161020"," That's William says the big worries that high inflation gets embedded in Expectation do like 418s"
"19161020","19162100"," feel like 29 cents. "
"19162140","19166120"," That's like a 60 70 cents trade Uh now that's a total lot."
"19166260","19166480"," Oh, right?"
"19166680","19167880"," That's not I don't think for a minute."
"19168060","19174300"," We're trading above this range tomorrow Uh, but it is something to consider for so because"
"19174300","19175660"," sometimes we do trade out of range, right?"
"19176520","19181120"," Tomorrow would be a great sense of the trade out of range And it fully affects the news, right?"

"19194520","19201280"," heading into thursday's Uh numbers that are coming out Uh, so the likely most likely trade I'm kind"
"19201280","19206800"," of wide butterfly and tomorrow if anything If if the news isn't bad tomorrow, it's probably good"

"21154540","21162420"," Well, there's two ways to look at the bond market Look at the bond market right now, so we're gonna"
"21162420","21171940"," get 62 Uh, so hyz You know, just remember something we're not as a bull. "
"21172120","21175460"," I'm not here to I As a bull."
"21175660","21178800"," I'm not here saying we're buying fucking the underlying of tesla here."
"21178920","21184500"," All right, so I'm not saying that at all English inform But let's look what the bond market says"
"21184500","21190520"," about tesla Because i'll show it to you right now what it's saying The bond market is bullish right"
"21190520","21190820"," now. "
"21190960","21195860"," Okay You see how it's trading above it's one minute and it's five minutes."
"21195880","21202980"," It's actually bullish right here uh, and this this probably corresponds quite well with Uh, where"
"21202980","21204020"," tesla's going right?"
"21205220","21208640"," Uh, so if I wanted to buy tesla again, what am I looking for?"
"21210100","21218640"," Uh, the the fact would be that i'm looking right now for a price above hyz of 75 70 Right,"
"21218780","21223900"," so you probably see h not you're gonna see this But if you did see hyz Trade above 75 70"
"21223900","21229360"," and hold it and start trading higher It would probably be a safe bet to buy tesla there wouldn't it"
"21230620","21235540"," That makes sense to you guys Um, and you're looking for your first down day if you're a bear you're"
"21235540","21245300"," probably looking for a rejection of 75 07 of hyz Your next one Uh, is 75 40"
"21245300","21254200"," and your next one right now is 75 66 Yeah, so it's not completely bearish It's bearish above here"
"21254200","21258300"," We've got lots of sellers above trying to knock this thing down But truly if you wanted a second"
"21258300","21264600"," leg in the stock market Uh, you'd be looking for a break above this stuff here a hold and I"
"21264600","21270320"," I would guarantee that's the second leg in the market Right now if we we jacked here and we started"
"21270320","21276340"," selling it down the question becomes how far do we sell it down Uh, what price this is right here,"
"21276360","21276540"," right?"
"21276720","21282640"," You could probably figure that out couldn't you bet you could uh, look at hyz I bet you could look"
"21282640","21289540"," at the hyz And find it's uh, find it's next the find spies next low if we reject here."
"21289720","21299320"," So chase on your own uh, look for Look for, um, this low right here and this low right here"
"21300400","21304600"," And look for rejection point Looking at the early mark from first four balance. "
"21304780","21312180"," It's currently sitting at 47 chart Or not 47 That's 396 politics us to the south side by 47 million"
"21312180","21316500"," to the south side for the early mark on closing balance But that's 396 right there if I had to"
"21316500","21330380"," guess We"
"21330380","21332100"," look at uh, let's look at that."
