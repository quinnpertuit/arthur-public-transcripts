"5950200","5960170"," fact Uh, here's a word of warning not warning, but Uh It is more bullish if we"
"5960170","5968050"," squeeze above And actually hold right here If we begin to squeeze immediately higher, it's less"
"5968050","5975850"," bullish over all down the road Uh, you want to see a nice clean break above Wait for the one"
"5975850","5980770"," in five minute to come up above And then take it to our return to the scene of the crime"
"5981530","5986610"," Some of you will disagree with me on that, but historically that's the best way to do it If we"
"5986610","5992210"," just monster start monster squeezing Uh, to the upside, it's usually we come back and blast right"
"5992210","5998650"," back through that Uh, hourly trigger and it's not choosing not bullish Unless you like to see that"
"5998650","6004210"," nice clean break above you like to see momentum come from up underneath and then carry us up into"

"6011670","6016530"," higher and higher Uh, that will violently come back down and usually break back down through the"
"6016530","6022510"," hourly trigger So we're looking for that nice clean break above and uh, consolidation Above the"
"6022510","6027650"," hourly trigger right now In the background i'm going to work on this stuff for you And we're going"

"6101220","6110840"," and you're looking for the um This white and green Or"
"6110840","6120020"," white and red to carry you up as you go Uh nice slow and orderly and what will happen here"
"6120020","6128800"," is, um What happened here is that the Uh, hourly trigger will follow you all the way up this box"
"6128800","6137520"," right here Will follow you all the way up and lens support So that when you come up here To"
"6137520","6145980"," this previous high right if it rejects So you come up here right whoop It rejects it'll actually"
"6145980","6153140"," hold And then we'll start making new highs Uh oftentimes not oftentimes, uh, but if we start to get"
"6153140","6160400"," explosive moves to the upside like this Will actually crash back down through the hourly Begin to"
"6160400","6164200"," wake up make our way, uh back down to retest that daily trigger."

"6199200","6206100"," covering Or if this is actual demand in the market coming up, uh, with price does that make sense?"
"6206660","6215540"," So are we just short covering right now or is there demand Actually moving up With price, okay Uh,"
"6215600","6221220"," so you want to see if that what that is is this just short covering Is this actual demand moving"
"6221220","6221980"," up with price?"
"6222820","6225040"," Uh, and what is more bullish, right?"
"6225180","6226220"," Short covering is not bullish."
"6226480","6226720"," Is it?"
"6227340","6234240"," That's just a relief rally until they begin to sell this shit back down on the depths of hell And"

"7186140","7195540"," So right now you can see that apple is testing Uh, it's daily trigger right here Um, now it's Uh,"
"7196060","7203180"," hourly trigger and half our trigger is turning sideways It's not going straight down any longer And"
"7203180","7209760"," there is some uh, there is some bottoming here On this stuff one thing that is concerning to me, of"
"7209760","7217640"," course is uh daily velo going to the downside Uh, some kind of souping motion On their earnings Uh,"
"7217880","7223720"," so what does apple need to do to keep the price where it is It's not good enough for apple"
"7223720","7231380"," to meet their expectations It's not good enough for apple to uh, beat slightly Apple needs to"
"7231380","7232420"," there's two things here. "
"7232420","7238920"," So if they beat their earnings slightly You're likely going to see a moment where people that own"
"7238920","7243740"," the underlying after the close that they're Uh, so you could see that squeeze higher in apple on on"
"7243740","7250420"," a good report Uh, but then if their guidance is not, you know, something crazy Uh, you could see"
"7250420","7261890"," apple easily begin to sell off to a new low down here Uh, so there's"
"7261890","7269350"," there's some cause for concern here into this into this uh close today If you were long apple Uh"
"7269350","7276090"," from back here in march or december or What have you it's time to take the money and run even"
"7276090","7277610"," if you get a good er, right?"
"7278450","7285570"," So you have only have a 3% Um, an implied move of 3% today On apple up and"
"7285570","7287130"," down right where we are right now."
"7287250","7290730"," So, um, that's cause for concern, right?"
"7291510","7301310"," Then an implied move of 3% and 3% Is Uh, right where we sold up"
"7301310","7309070"," here Right where supply is So if you get a good er from apple After the bell they're likely going"
"7309070","7311150"," to try to sell into you Do you understand?"
"7311590","7318070"," So in apple specifically if you get a good report If you get good guns Uh, there are sellers"
"7318070","7324130"," waiting above here after this bell to sell into you Stalker, right?"
"7324410","7331630"," 3% expected move on apple and they're you're gonna run right into in a supply here Um, so you"
"7331630","7339860"," need to know that about apple Uh, that they're going to try to sell down into you Up here, uh,"
"7339960","7346680"," and that is what's priced into Uh, the move for today You also have a move to the downside on"
"7346680","7354480"," apple of 3% And that kind of puts you with that swooping motion down below here Uh, so if"
"7354480","7360940"," you're looking to act if you've exited apple already if you're long apple Uh, you are looking to"
"7360940","7367960"," believe it or not by 185 70 Uh, so if you're looking to get back into the market and you're"
"7367960","7372220"," like, hey, we're going to continue higher Uh, but if we're going to continue high, we have a great"
"7372220","7379600"," reason here We have a great reason here on apple to um, so we had this nice big sell off"
"7379600","7384720"," right had this nice bloodletting And who wins here?"
"7385760","7393200"," Let's talk about who wins here in apple If apple has a good er, I can exit right Bye-bye"
"7394720","7397880"," If apple has a bad er Right."
"7398040","7403400"," I already took the money and ran And come back down here and get a sweet dip by too long"
"7403400","7410280"," apple into end of year Uh, not a bad deal for people right to buy apple, uh, at 185 There's"
"7410280","7416720"," probably some of you out there that are like, nah, nah cap Um Um, 185 is not low enough So"
"7416720","7424260"," if apple misses Their er, their price target to the downside Not withstanding, this will take some"
"7424260","7433200"," time This could take a couple weeks, but their downside target 174 78 You get that 174 78 you will"
"7433200","7442320"," see 425 on the s&p 500 Uh, what's my take on what i'm expecting out of apple today It's"
"7442320","7443400"," fucking apple. "
"7443400","7451020"," I'm going to swear for you right now It's apple It's apple Uh, I think after their bell this shit's"
"7451020","7459600"," going to scream higher Uh, it's definitely going to trade 196 after this bell I expect apple to"
"7459600","7467180"," have a great report And I expect apple to go up after this close here today And I expect large"
"7467180","7472720"," holders of apple to attempt to exit Around 4 15 in the afternoon 6 o'clock in the afternoon."
"7472720","7476820"," I think that's what they're going to try to do to you Uh, so I think apple does go up."
"7476960","7482760"," I'm bullish here on apple and their, uh, close here today How long that holds for?"
"7483280","7483700"," I don't know. "
"7484020","7491280"," I don't think it holds Uh for much longer unless you get a Unless you get a um Some kind"
"7491280","7496440"," of big news But I mean big like, uh, we're launching this right now."
"7496440","7502240"," They're not known for that Uh, we're splitting our stock would work for me too Um, but they"
"7502240","7504140"," announced the stocks with something like that."
"7504160","7509140"," That would be a big deal Uh, but but otherwise think about apple right here. "
"7509260","7515480"," They're kind of priced in Uh, if we're going to price in ai for them Uh Like they had had"
"7515480","7518680"," the announcement for ai these fucking banks want to get in at a lower price."
"7518680","7527960"," So Uh Ultimately price started on apple 185 and some change Yeah, they went either way if you get"
"7527960","7533640"," caught in this If you're a long apple here and you get you get caught in this Uh, I don't"
"7533640","7538720"," think that I would say he would be just just hang out just stay long test or not Tesla Stay"
"7538720","7540460"," long apple and still comes back up there."
"7540640","7542040"," I don't think apple's done. "
"7542340","7547260"," I think I don't I don't think they announced this this ai stuff In an earnings call."
"7547400","7548500"," I think they do it in an event."
"7549600","7559280"," Um, but Um, I think ultimately over time, uh, apple is one of those companies that uh, is not Done"
"7559280","7559680"," growing. "
"7560020","7565400"," I don't think that they're done growing as a company and uh, whatever that is cars ai."
"7565440","7567880"," I don't care Um, they're a powerhouse."
"7568320","7571700"," Um They are a needful thing that people have in their lives. "
"7572580","7577900"," Um, so Uh, I don't want to say any on that on that topic I know there are bulls out"
"7577900","7579300"," there that want to buy 182."
"7579600","7580700"," They want to buy 175."
"7581480","7589790"," They're just begging for it Let's get in at a lower price for that move with ai So there's apple"
"7589790","7590330"," right there. "
"7590430","7590930"," There's your expected."
"7591290","7596350"," Uh, you have your expected moves on apple and then my prediction for apple Um, my prediction for"
"7596350","7600850"," apple is that it does go up after the bell Uh, that it does go up there and try to"
"7600850","7605370"," trade that uh, that upside target But I think there's going to be some profit taking either"
"7605370","7612490"," sometime tonight or into friday and into next week on apple's earnings Next thing we're going to do"
"7612490","7622380"," is amazon And You"
"7622380","7628660"," can see the same kind of a walk the plank type thing Uh, what is fascinating about amazon here is"
"7628660","7634120"," they're just beginning to become bullish Um, they have been clawing their way back."
"7634840","7645180"," Um, Now I do have more concern here on uh, on on amazon than I do on Uh On"
"7645180","7646100"," apple believe it or not. "
"7646220","7651220"," So amazon, I have more concern I don't like seeing us come back down to the zero line on the"
"7651220","7657580"," daily trigger on amazon Um, I do have some concern that someone's going to want to buy this down"
"7657580","7666140"," below at 117 Um They are losing a lot of their momentum Uh right now on amazon."
"7666400","7676150"," So for me I would really like to buy amazon down below at 118 118 I'd like to buy"
"7676150","7686200"," amazon if possible You've got another price target down below here on amazon of 123"
"7686200","7702060"," and some change I'm going to give you an upside target right now Do"
"7702060","7711780"," you do it be baller to see, uh, open up the limb It would be baller to see Apple"
"7711780","7719620"," just break through in this earnings and smash 200 But it never happens with them a bit like they're"
"7719620","7726260"," not that company for me You know, it's like for them to be that company for for apple to be"
"7726260","7736210"," that company for me Uh For for apple and whatever"
"7736210","7745880"," apple for me has made me like money the second day It's always like a stock split And amazon"
"7745880","7755700"," has a five point eight percent move Uh much larger swing Uh priced in for"
"7755700","7755940"," it."
"7756120","7763540"," So we're gonna take a look at where amazon is sitting five point eight percent That's right there A"
"7763540","7772700"," little bit lower So we'll move this down right here And"
"7772700","7782650"," then to the upside Same same setup as apple right see that same setup as"
"7782650","7791290"," apple Um Um Let's see exact same setup as apple no difference here All these sellers up here are"
"7791290","7797430"," looking to take profit On amazon looking to take profit even if you get a great er they're going to"
"7797430","7802250"," look to take profit up here today at the close Uh after the bell so i'm going to expect any"
"7802250","7808910"," good any good any good report on amazon apple Uh they're going to sell into you on that report The"
"7808910","7811690"," same thing is going to go for apple as amazon. "
"7812150","7818610"," So if you're looking for stink bids down below on amazon Uh the implied move down below is 12324."
"7819090","7820790"," I would be looking for lower."
"7821030","7833290"," I'd be looking for uh 118 possibly even 115 Uh on apple for on amazon for a pullback We'll"
"7833290","7843210"," look at uh coin next And i'll put these up for after the bell so we can watch them Now"
"7843210","7853970"," i'll put them on weebl for you and we'll watch these reports as they come in coin"
"7857180","7871600"," coin coin coin Here support here Boyman,"
"7871600","7873160"," that's all really light too. "
"7873160","7873580"," Isn't it?"
"7873920","7894980"," It's all looks like squeezing here coin"
"7894980","7909940"," base, um 8.3% implied move So right there"
"7913810","7924210"," I don't know man Uh if you're a coin base bull You better pope and pray That"
"7924210","7934150"," you get a good uh er here Um hope and pray They"
"7934150","7938010"," priced in an 8.3% move on coin base."
"7938010","7947530"," I'll tell you this I like this ticker the most so far Because I don't believe you're getting an 8 "
"7947530","7949210",".3% move."
"7949650","7958250"," I think you're going to get an outsized move Uh, I think you break I think if you get a"
"7958250","7967970"," bad er on coin base, I think it's easy To trade 7784 or 75 excuse"
"7967970","7973590"," me I think it's easy for you to trade 75 and I also think it's easy for you to trade"
"7973590","7983110"," 70 bucks That er on on on coin base, uh, outsized move expected $70 Trade 91 60"
"7986350","7996250"," They have better have a really nice a really nice er because if they do they could trade 110"
"7996250","8006330"," I like this trade I'm interested in like a, uh, three maybe a two or three expiry"
"8006330","8012550"," out Uh way out way out way of tm calls and puts and then let's one side burn or just"
"8012550","8021350"," hold both sides until they both print I actually like this trade like a 76 p and a 110 See"
"8021850","8026010"," Uh, and I bet you bet you one side would pay for the other side. "
"8026010","8032350"," Let's take a look at that trade Uh, I think you're going to get an outsized move on, uh, coin"
"8032350","8053000"," base Next one we'll look at is, uh, sq Sq,"
"8053360","8055240"," uh broke below today."
"8055560","8065480"," It's daily trigger Um, I really like to see sq even if they get a"
"8065480","8065840"," good earnings."
"8066480","8080100"," I like to see sq trade down To 69 some panic, uh, and then trade higher here Something"
"8080100","8080720"," like this. "
"8080820","8090740"," I actually think sq has, uh, underperformed Uh, I like sq like a panic trade and then I like to"
"8090740","8094660"," ask you for a swing trade um Almost right away."
"8094680","8104460"," So I like sq I'm going to bet that they just meet earnings"
"8105700","8113920"," That's the only thing about sq is they just they just hit earnings No, they'll have a sell off and"
"8113920","8131280"," there'll be a great dip bite out here Talk"
"8131280","8138380"," about a talk about a plank to walk though Um, I'll tell you what man if you're a bear out"

"8187680","8193520"," why you wake I'm like, I'm weak because I want to see if this downgrade is real or not Uh,"
"8193959","8198000"," and I wanted to see if we started blasting down before the below the deli level if that shit was"
"8198000","8204200"," real You would have blasted down below that deli level like nobody's business Uh, so we're gonna"
"8204200","8212780"," we're gonna look today at SQ Coinbase apple and amazon for the close Um, we're gonna go back over"

"8241480","8249879"," a bloodbath Right there And then tag this and tag that down there to the to the deli trigger I'm"
"8249879","8251520"," gonna keep our eyes on this one right here."
"8253600","8255559"," Let's see if this confirms right here."
"8255719","8268520"," So let's turn it to a red Right here We'll see if the bears can hold on to it Yellow"
"8268520","8278400"," right there But it's fascinating i'm watching"
"8278400","8284180"," uh apple and amazon and i'm like I'm like type of walk in the plank like If you've got the"
"8284180","8291260"," downgrade And then if you were to combine that with bad earnings from apple and amazon Uh, that"
"8291260","8295000"," would signal to me, uh, the attempt at a correction in the market. "
"8295260","8303860"," That's what i would expect Um, so i'm fascinated to see I'm fascinated to see what this close is"
"8303860","8309879"," today Uh, if they actually get this correction in the market, that would that would be enough for"
"8309879","8322150"," me Um Would be bad earnings on apple and amazon Your"
"8322150","8336330"," long, uh, coin shares Let me look at a coin really quick one more time Um From"
"8336330","8342549"," 89 your long coin shares Um, I just put a stop limit to the down and upside on it No,"
"8342709","8347830"," I like I wouldn't nick tell people what you're gonna do, but I would have a stop I'm like i'm"
"8347830","8355090"," gonna assume here that I'm gonna assume here that they're gonna try to trigger $80 so i'd be under"
"8355090","8361030"," 80 bucks on that Um If they do try to trigger it's gonna be right below 80 bucks if they"
"8361030","8380459"," start stop hunting on coinbase Uh, I"
"8380459","8383139"," like the outside move on coinbase the up and down move."
"8383299","8385100"," I'm not really bear sharing coinbase."
"8385260","8394730"," I just like the I like the The idea that coinbase could trade outside of its implied move Like I"
"8394730","8404390"," think I think coinbase can easily trade 72, um I do And I think they can easily trade That 110"
"8404390","8407110"," no problem and they're not priced in for that move. "
"8407210","8419020"," So I think coinbase has like the ability to Be that out performer Um in either direction Oh,"
"8419080","8419820"," I didn't do Airbnb."
"8419860","8422380"," Did I let's go back and do Airbnb my bad."
"8422660","8426180"," I forgot about Airbnb I said I would do that one. "
"8426340","8428280"," So we'll do that multiple put five charts up."
"8428320","8430860"," I'll do six for the for the clothes."
"8431180","8441040"," I'll do uh all five tickers and spy Let me do uh a b&b Ab"
"8441040","8449200"," nib We're gonna do ab nib next same kind of a setup now this one. "
"8449240","8461220"," I'm bullish on I'm actually bullish here Hold on a second Let me uh switch over I"
"8461220","8474330"," am bullish on Airbnb I'm bullish I'm actually bullish here In"
"8474330","8478570"," my view they're either going to get a they're either going to get a really good at ER Or they're"
"8478570","8479710"," going to get quickly bought up."
"8479890","8484130"," So of all these charts right here If you want to know what which one most bullish on probably"
"8484130","8501160"," Airbnb Probably Airbnb I hate"
"8501160","8505000"," this because every day I do these with you And I dig do pretty well."
"8505120","8510640"," I'm like 90% winner in these Pics every day like 90% even Starbucks came back. "
"8510940","8517800"," I was like that's bullshit and Starbucks did come back Paypal might cut that shit right then then"
"8517800","8522160"," in there cut that shit But like uh my pics have been pretty good."
"8522380","8529780"," So Airbnb is probably my pick If I had one that had the best potential for a bull move to"
"8529780","8540280"," the upside I am bullish here uh on Airbnb believe it or not I am I"
"8540280","8550440"," see the risk to the downside here I think it would be quickly bought up too I"
"8550440","8555160"," don't think this one gets down to its weekly trigger Uh, nope."
"8555400","8562560"," I don't think it gets down to its weekly trigger So it's at 140 bucks, right?"
"8562820","8569600"," I think you'll be lucky to get I think you'd be lucky That's a 6.9% move I'd be"
"8569600","8576440"," selling puts on this I would I'd be selling puts on this one Um Apps to fucking lily I'd be"
"8576440","8585640"," selling puts on this one They have an implied move of 6.9 to the downside Uh, and I would"
"8585640","8593880"," be I would say um If Airbnb sells off I would be look if they have like a decent if"
"8593880","8600500"," they have a decent dr today And they were to sell off This is like a Starbucks candidate Uh, you"
"8600500","8605640"," just go to the open buy it and it's probably going to rip faces off Uh, not print any of"
"8605640","8614460"," those puts Uh, so I am actually pretty fucking bullish on Airbnb So if you get a decent Er on"
"8614460","8620660"," Airbnb But it doesn't meet expectations like you beat everything but you don't you like nice beat"
"8621480","8629360"," barely barely barely doesn't beat high expectations And by open it'll start ripping faces off So"
"8629360","8631820"," keep an eye on this one because it has a great ER. "
"8632100","8637440"," It's going to go up If it has a if it has like an okay, we're we're we're we're um,"

"9499170","9499930"," places, right?"
"9500150","9505790"," I have a problem with that Uh, I also have a problem with, uh, airbnbs and places where there is"

"9512070","9518730"," Airbnb from those places And most of those places have restrictions on airbnbs Like park city Utah,"
"9519130","9524310"," there's a restriction on airbnbs So to say that's not being addressed is kind of not true either"
"9524950","9528590"," Uh, in most places, like you can't have an Airbnb, did you know that?"

"9545490","9550450"," Uh, British Columbia in general, Seattle Um, Portland, it's a problem, right?"
"9550610","9557870"," I agree with that too Um But also people that are asking to live in some of those places It's"
"9557870","9562590"," odd because the person, oftentimes the person that's asking Well, there's no affordable housing in"
"9562590","9570770"," New York City Right, there's no affordable housing in Los Angeles Uh, in Santa Monica There's no"

"9611330","9616030"," school for free Or college for free or university for free And couldn't afford it in this state"
"9616030","9621910"," That's very expensive So yeah, you might not get to live in, um, Santa Monica, California But there"

"11103270","11109650"," profit Uh, and look forward to the wrapping up of earnings season and then coming into the end of"
"11109650","11116190"," summer and fall Uh, so those two things right there should weigh on you to some extent Uh, we know"

"11132290","11132910"," any good earnings. "
"11133230","11139090"," This is where the sellers are if apple were to go up and rip some faces off We know that"
"11139090","11140750"," the south side is waiting above here."
"11140990","11147650"," Uh, where that where that red That red bar is we also know we got a bounce down below in"
"11147650","11152530"," the daily trigger We kind of parked the market right here in this daily trigger down here So we"
"11152530","11158490"," know there is some demand down below here Uh, this is not to be trifled with this is a major"
"11158490","11164310"," signpost area down here at this 440 I think was 447 in some change we had as a target."
"11164390","11172950"," We hit 447 37 to the downside Now bears are looking for uh continuation to the downside, right?"
"11173690","11178490"," Uh, they want to see this market fail They in their view that we're setting up. "
"11178610","11185270"," So the bear case here Is that we go into these these earnings today Uh, they're ugly and nasty,"
"11185270","11185950"," right?"
"11186210","11196550"," We begin to reject off of the uh, hourly trigger at 454.51 Uh begin to trade below 448 And"
"11196550","11204350"," confirm the move lower Uh, that lower move is significant to the downside So we're gonna get a 15"
"11204350","11209850"," minute chart right now for that significant move and I want you to see that gap down there Uh, that"
"11209850","11216950"," gap is huge I want you to see it down here Uh, way down here, right a price target for"
"11216950","11220030"," this First leg down is going to be 440."
"11220990","11229050"," Okay, so I'm going to draw a white box down here for you for 440 Right down in here."
"11229170","11237750"," Okay Actually bring this a little bit Maybe even maybe even get a little bit of a sweeter deal down"
"11237750","11246950"," here Try a 438 And 437 Okay I'm gonna make that white here because"
"11246950","11254690"," I want to show you something about Uh, where the actual bottom is And it's not right here at this"
"11254690","11255290"," white box. "
"11255430","11261190"," This is kind of like a midway point We would likely trade all the way down to the weekly trigger"
"11261750","11263590"," Let me show you how deep that is right now."
"11263590","11269530"," Okay, just so you're aware of this So if the bears had their way here Hold on a second here"
"11271030","11280890"," For the bear thesis to play out You are looking for a bad earnings Wrapping up earnings"
"11280890","11290030"," to trade below this 448, right But hold on here And begin to make our way down here to this"
"11290030","11297750"," 436, 437, 438 zone Uh, and even if we have an up move here to begin to make our way"
"11297750","11307110"," down to Uh 426 Calling that takes us probably puts us at that time"
"11307110","11314390"," Probably puts us at 430 on spy And 432 Zero on es."
"11314830","11321010"," Okay, because this orange box will raise up at some point But I would expect that bloodbath to the"
"11321010","11321210"," downside. "
"11321430","11326150"," That's the bear case So if you're a bull out there or if you're a bear out there, you are"
"11326150","11332810"," looking too short Uh, this 451, 452 Uh to start slamming down this market."
"11333030","11340010"," Okay, that's your that's your bear case If you're theta gang neutral gang theta gang Uh, you are"
"11340010","11349850"," looking for us to spend some time consolidating between this 448, 450 And this previous high"
"11349850","11358110"," up here at 459 So about a 90 point consolidation Uh for us to gain what we need to actually"
"11358110","11366090"," go higher and slap The jpm caller that everybody likes to forget about nobody wants to talk about"
"11366090","11371670"," that jpm caller to the upside We have not hit it yet Um, so if you're theta gang Uh, and"
"11371670","11376090"," you think hey, you know what we're in the middle of august rates august third Uh, we're likely"
"11376090","11381430"," going to trade this thing sideways for a few weeks before we even attempt To make a run into the"
"11381430","11390750"," beginning of september To vahala up here at 466 465 Then you might say, yeah, you know, it's going"
"11390750","11395890"," to take some time in here We're going to tease the bears with that crash Right, and you're going to"
"11395890","11399610"," be able to trade this sideways for the next week or two and then we're going to make this up"
"11399610","11407590"," into the end of august Uh and finally slap that ask up there on the jpm caller If you are"
"11407590","11414410"," a bull I have to warn you of something here Okay, if you are a bull, we do not need"
"11414410","11424170"," to hold up here the trade above But you do Need to get up here And close this"
"11424170","11430010"," gap It is okay for you as a bull for us to trade back down to make that run higher"
"11430790","11436370"," What you do not want here if you are a bull is any kind of rejection on this hourly trigger"
"11437250","11443110"," I'm telling you something here If you're a bull and you think we're going higher not going to"
"11443110","11452410"," correct You must break above the hourly trigger You don't have a choice You must go back up above"
"11452410","11458930"," and close some of these gaps up here Even if we roll back over You must do that you must"
"11458930","11468090"," form a base of interest and buying Here to make that next leg higher In that correction for the"
"11468090","11473110"," bears just to bring this back to the bears really quick If you get that correction as a bear Do"
"11473110","11474990"," you I think they're rolling the market over there?"
"11475370","11481330"," No, and even if they do roll the market over there You are going to see the yellow line the"
"11481330","11487530"," the trigger roll down with price So if we see that yellow line rolling down with price I will let"
"11487530","11491390"," you know if i'm like hey, this might be the actual top I will let you know if I see"
"11491390","11495350"," that yellow line if I see that yellow line going up straight ahead That means it's just a"
"11495350","11495550"," correction."
"11496210","11502410"," So we'll pay close attention to that for you if you're a seller If this does at any point turns"
"11502410","11505350"," into the top of the market And it's not a correction. "
"11505610","11506630"," We're going to roll this stuff down."
"11506890","11512950"," You will likely have at least one opportunity To unfuck yourself from this market."
"11513170","11520210"," And so here's a key point here Let's say this is the top of the market and price does get"
"11520210","11528190"," up here You're not done bulls You still have to hold above the hourly trigger If we begin to roll"
"11528190","11534310"," off that hourly trigger That is going to be your signal to exit this market right there Okay, so I"
"11534310","11540450"," mean very very hyper like bulls have a lot of paying attention to do Paying attention to do to the"
"11540450","11547950"," market right now If you want to know what my take on the market is here Uh, my take in"
"11547950","11553930"," the market here for myself personally Is I am a bull I am a bull. "
"11554130","11559930"," I want to see the market get above 452 do I think the market can get above there?"
"11560090","11565610"," Yes, I do And do I think the market can get all the time as yes, I do Uh, do"
"11565610","11568890"," I think we're getting a full pull back to 425 right now?"
"11569190","11573610"," I think you're out of your fucking mind I think you're gonna get that in september october."
"11573850","11579210"," I think that's when you get your big roll I think you get your second big roll in february Uh,"
"11579350","11584830"," so I don't believe and i've got puts in this market I don't believe you that we're going down to"
"11584830","11590610"," 425 right now Uh, you better hope and pray if you're a bear that you get some terrible earnings"
"11590610","11597530"," today Uh, you need some real bad news for this market to unload this fast I think we're going to"
"11597530","11606390"," be rangebound trading sideways and up for consolidation Uh consolidate this area right here For a"
"11606390","11614990"," larger move higher to slam up and trade That jpm collar to the upside Uh, now my view will change"

"11621030","11625830"," stuff the market like I don't know standard port comes out and says something nasty Or we start"
"11625830","11627850"," getting really bad earnings that kind of stuff."

"11634690","11640770"," going to expect to be trading this Uh for consolidation for enough will to go to the upside between"
"11640770","11650530"," 448 for 50 and 459 for 60 Probably for the next coming weeks Next couple two three weeks something"

"13280260","13281640"," But we had no idea."
"13281960","13288220"," I mean, I had no idea that s&p 500 would close down 1.4 Elena did you know because"
"13288220","13294380"," it's like you kind of read the market's mind yesterday morning I had no idea but accidentally I"
"13294380","13301200"," just said, you know, we are overdue for a correction You know, there hasn't been a 5% correction if"
"13301200","13307500"," the s&p 500 since the banking crisis in march We've been out for five consecutive months. "
"13307800","13314260"," It may be time for a breeder So it's not necessarily a big risk of event You know the most"
"13314260","13320080"," equity indexes are in the red But we are not talking about you know, just a total market"
"13320080","13326020"," capitulation Yes, then we just parts of the market are doing more for example for all of those"

"13334360","13340760"," since November yesterday and it's down another 1% today So some of the shtages parts of the market"
"13340760","13350660"," actually more precious than some of the strongest parts than the s&p 500 for example Because I"
"13350660","13355780"," know you follow the options space so closely as well Is there anything going on when it comes to"
"13355780","13362800"," options that can give us a clue as to what we're seeing in the equities market overall today What"
"13362800","13369960"," is happening is the options traders are Putting war emphasis on tomorrow's jobs are born and on"
"13369960","13378160"," next with CBI reports back Earlier this year these two events were more or less a non-eventful"
"13378160","13383680"," volatility traders So what they did was they bought protection both upside and downside and then"
"13383680","13388540"," they did not end up needing that protection So they said to themselves a wide bother but right now"
"13388540","13395000"," it's a different environment We may aspire into bigger sell-off things may follow you another"
"13395000","13400360"," couple of percentage points from this level So they do need more protection and that's what they"
"13400360","13408000"," are doing They're buying more protection ahead of tomorrow's event and ahead of next week's CBI But"
"13408000","13413380"," Alex if that does happen if we do you see some sort of pullback in the s&p 500 There's"
"13413380","13418100"," so much dry powder on the sidelines There's so many people who've missed out on this rally because"
"13418100","13421860"," it happens so quickly in such a short period of time Are they gonna just jump back in?"
"13422320","13422720"," Exactly."
"13422900","13426520"," So as Alina said there is more focus right now on the macro if you look at the last couple"
"13426520","13431240"," of days There's nothing really that has changed the bulk case soft branding optimism is still"
"13431240","13435540"," intact We're still nearing peak rates, but of course it depends what we see from that jobs report"
"13435540","13440420"," tomorrow That's really good to determine how investors are feeling about the rest of the year But"
"13440420","13445240"," you know, even if we do get a jobs report that renews worries about where interest rates will go"
"13445240","13449920"," One of my sources jhat feels over at infrastructure capital partners I know he's a friend of the"
"13449920","13451240"," show and he comes out often He's great."
"13451420","13455500"," He was telling you that he thinks that so many people have missed out on the rally that they might"
"13455500","13460040"," see the pullback as an Opportunity to step in them into the market and get some of their cash off"
"13460040","13463800"," of the sidelines So we won't get this arm to get in type of sell-off that a lot of"
"13463800","13466820"," investors are worried about because they see it as an opportunity Exactly. "
"13467280","13471300"," So they'll start to pile in the ones that have missed out on the rally that have been you know"
"13471300","13475660"," sitting on cash We'll say okay the market is you know going through a correction now is a good time"
"13475660","13481780"," to buy stocks So i'm curious then about when we know that the pullback or the profit taking is kind"
"13481780","13486440"," of wrapping up What are your sources telling you about that and what does that sort of start to"
"13486440","13491520"," look like Yeah, so I mean of course people are seeing this volatility is a good time to do some"
"13491520","13497460"," profit taking City groups flows data show that positioning along positions on the s&p 500 suggested"
"13497460","13502620"," that profit taking risks was You know something that people were kind of expecting You know,"
"13502660","13507120"," especially ahead of some big events that we have we have the tech earnings today and the jobs"
"13507120","13512060"," report tomorrow So before they get those reports they kind of wanted to lock in their gains this"
