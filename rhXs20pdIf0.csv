"66630","68890"," All right, so good morning everybody."
"69170","70130"," Welcome to the last dream."
"70550","73810"," I will be on at 10 a.m. I've got a few small things you got to take care of"
"73810","74250"," with my kids. "
"74390","75230"," I'll be right back."
"75850","80950"," But you will be seeing you'll at least have the book have book map up for you this morning and"
"80950","84550"," the chart is charted out for today."
"85070","89070"," Be conscious of this blue line here this morning. "
"89890","92810"," I don't know what I don't know if I should make this or this green line."
"92930","94690"," I'm not sure if I should make this green or yellow."
"95710","96610"," This was the green line. "
"96610","99550"," From yesterday that book map support that we had yesterday."
"99650","100550"," I don't know if you can see that."
"100790","103110"," Hold on a second here. "
"104830","108270"," So this was that this was that close that we had yesterday."
"108270","110390"," Maybe I should extend this red line."
"112860","116280"," So when we came in yet or we we closed out yesterday. "
"117060","122460"," The market this became a pin into cash again today."
"122460","122820"," Okay."
"123580","133320"," So this three this three ninety five nineteen this zone down here is going to act as a pivot"
"133320","133900"," point. "
"133900","137380"," A pivot point technically today is three ninety seven twenty six."
"137780","143140"," So you're going to give measures extending the cons tenure yield rises to three spot seven five"
"143140","143660"," percent."
"143860","146760"," Make sure you let people know that make sure you let people know that this morning. "
"147340","147740"," So."
"148660","152740"," So this zone right here I want you to realize that the real pivot point is three ninety seven"
"152740","153380"," twenty six."
"153820","157180"," For you to get bullish we need to trade above this. "
"157780","158600"," This morning."
"158600","162940"," The cost as I can't anticipate how much rates need to climb."
"163620","166960"," Here's the gap to close off of the open this morning. "
"167260","168800"," Now I do want to warn you that."
"168940","170780"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"171320","175680"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear order flame futures for ex and stock instruments. "
"176180","176900"," Hang tight here."
"176920","178860"," Free trial at Ticksright.com."
"179600","186000"," So it's probable that we bounce off the bell here and try to close this gap above today."
"186000","189880"," But I do want you to be aware that if we reverse off of this pivot. "
"191860","194420"," The overall trend is down right now."
"195140","202340"," It would be nothing for us to attempt to make this trade higher bounce off the pivot and then start"
"202340","202980"," moving lower."
"205160","207160"," I would say to you that. "
"209060","210820"," Let me say I put this on here real quick."
"211280","212180"," Just a second here."
"213760","218260"," There's going to be a magnet down below here for three ninety. "
"220320","223280"," Possibly even lower to three eighty six three eighty three."
"224260","229680"," And that's the lower band of that down channel that I was showing that we've been we've been"
"229680","232740"," talking about that the bottom end of that down channel for the past week."
"232740","235020"," Like last four or five trading sessions. "
"235540","237800"," We've talked about three eighty three eighty five."
"238420","241360"," But there should be some kind of a magnet down here as well."
"241980","243580"," Let me see if I can write this in here. "
"244000","245420"," There's some kind of a magnet does it."
"245480","248080"," Just be careful of that."
"249260","253460"," Be careful of the mantra of close the gap above. "
"256480","259899"," If everyone's trying to close the gap it seems like everyone's trying to close the gap."
"259920","260839"," They're not going to close it."
"260839","262380"," They won't. "
"262780","265020"," So this is a magnet down here."
"265200","266020"," So just be careful."
"266260","270840"," This might my thought is off the bell that we're going to trade this straight up and try to close"
"270840","271660"," that gap above. "
"273440","275360"," Here's that gap we're talking about here."
"279200","282940"," That everyone seems to want to close reset shorts that kind of stuff."
"283220","290820"," So I'm going to expect that gap to get close today. "
"290820","291940"," Or right off the open bell."
"292500","295460"," And then we slam into the pivot point and start trading lower."
"296720","298480"," Still use this zero gamut. "
"298620","300640"," This is basically it's not quite there again."
"300760","304520"," But this is going to decide which way we go today is this little green and red box."
"304780","304960"," Okay. "
"305800","308900"," Is that going to be very supportive or it's going to leave."
"309080","311200"," If you see we start trade below this this point here."
"311800","312640"," We're going down. "
"312820","312960"," Okay."
"313100","316220"," And you're going to have a price target down below 390 possibly even lower."
"317840","319960"," To 384 33 35. "
"320100","320700"," Believe it or not."
"321140","323160"," So just be conscious of this zone here."
"323360","328340"," You don't want to be caught below this and being bullish today. "
"328480","328680"," Okay."
"329240","331740"," And I do think we close the gap today or tomorrow."
"331840","337520"," If we don't close this tomorrow, it might be a nice trade to pick up even just a call spread"
"337520","339340"," for Wednesday to close this gap. "
"339740","342600"," That way you don't even have to worry about where we head to get here."
"342600","346100"," If we trade down and back up and swoop up to grab it."
"346980","349480"," But at Wednesday at some point it might be a nice trade. "
"350380","352740"," To consider putting on like a two day spread."
"353880","354780"," Let me see here."
"356120","359580"," And you can see that we're trying to get you can see right on book map that we're trying to"
"359580","361240"," bounce into some support down here. "
"362180","363780"," So we'll see if this support holds."
"364180","366640"," So even even the opening belts looking like."
"366640","370400"," You know, there could be this, you know, grind down, kill all these options. "
"371480","373860"," Maybe even step it down and you get to rip to your gap."
"374280","376500"," So look for an opportunity down here to take long."
"377260","380840"," Be careful of all the mantra on on Twitter and fintuit. "
"382880","387200"," And trade like you normally trade regardless of all the noise that's out there."
"387280","388660"," That's the only thing I can say to you guys."
"390100","392780"," When you're listening to people on Twitter and fintuit. "
"393640","394740"," So good morning to you."
"396680","397520"," Good morning to you."
"397600","399420"," I'll be here at a note at 10. "
"399560","400740"," No, no, no, no later."
"401520","402380"," I've got my kids."
"402540","404280"," I'm trying to get them into school right now. "
"404360","405280"," My wife's busy in a meeting."
"405720","407680"," I just need about just need about 10, 15 minutes."
"407820","411700"," I can get them started and I will be right back to trade with you in a minute. "
"411720","413100"," 20 left until opening bell."
"414100","417080"," Let everybody know about the zero gamma, the magnet down below the pinpoint."
"418360","418960"," And the gap above. "
"419700","420580"," And I will be right back."
"420720","422000"," Let me see if I can make this bigger for you."
"427440","428240"," There we go. "
"428820","429400"," All right."
"429400","726920"," I'll be right back to Italy"
"726920","730600"," prepares a 50% wind full tax on energy firms, excess gains."
"913950","914550"," All right. "
"914610","915110"," I'm on with you."
"915210","915850"," Hold on a second here."
"916390","922100"," I'm going to turn this thing off. "
"927760","928880"," Good morning everybody."
"929060","929520"," How y'all doing?"
"933020","935020"," I'm going to get this camera on for you."
"943580","945180"," Camera gets all touchy fairly. "
"948240","949360"," Let me just take it here."
"958040","958920"," Come on now."
"970520","971380"," Just take it here. "
"980180","981100"," All right."
"981240","981540"," Let's go."
"983980","984820"," Let's see if this works. "
"985500","985720"," Okay."
"988480","990860"," Got like map testing and stuff I'm looking at."
"992520","997140"," You got kids that tell you how good they are in school and then you want to make sure they're"
"997140","998140"," actually doing well in schools. "
"998400","999000"," We have state tests."
"999240","1000240"," We hope we homeschool our kids."
"1002140","1002980"," Good morning everybody. "
"1003200","1003620"," How y'all doing?"
"1004120","1004480"," Yeah."
"1004660","1004800"," That's right."
"1005000","1006100"," Dad's in the house this morning. "
"1007020","1008260"," Where's my, where's Josh to?"
"1008420","1008600"," Oh, yeah."
"1008740","1009580"," Josh, you are in here."
"1013780","1014420"," All right. "
"1014700","1019420"," So we kind of see we're in this rough place right now, right?"
"1021200","1023420"," We'll take a look just at book map real quick."
"1025220","1027420"," Let's let's exit the screen, go over to book map."
"1030000","1033660"," Shit, I got to, let me close that right there. "
"1035880","1039839"," Now, let's take a look at book map real quick and a larger, larger scale here."
"1054140","1060780"," Now, you just take a look down below 3947."
"1061820","1063500"," It's basically 395, right?"
"1064800","1068300"," Uh, looking to, to climb above here. "
"1069200","1070280"," For a move higher."
"1070460","1070780"," There's one."
"1070860","1071760"," There's some concern here. "
"1072340","1074920"," I'm not seeing any targets that are really high."
"1075160","1077180"," Are you seeing target targets that are really high?"
"1077320","1077560"," I'm not."
"1077740","1079740"," I'm seeing, you're seeing like some of these. "
"1080900","1082600"," Sell orders disappearing up here."
"1082740","1083180"," That's a concern."
"1085700","1089960"," I said with that 4000 level and that's to close the gap above. "
"1090180","1091180"," You really want to see those."
"1091940","1095000"," You want to see like a target up here and we're not seeing it."
"1095260","1096580"," And look what's appearing down below. "
"1099790","1102290"," That's 3925 down below."
"1103830","1108950"," So if you think about if you're, if you've got book map open wherever you are and however your"
"1108950","1110910"," settings are, there's concern, right?"
"1112590","1115530"," I'm looking for a target above or a target below."
"1115530","1118290"," I'm looking for a place for the market to go. "
"1118630","1119610"," So when we open in the morning."
"1121030","1124270"," This isn't always the case, but I'm looking in the morning."
"1124370","1126050"," I want to see where the targets are. "
"1126690","1129450"," Do we have, do we have more sellers above?"
"1130470","1132450"," Do we have more buy orders below?"
"1133930","1139650"," And the market, not always, but has a tendency to want to go to that place."
"1140750","1142270"," So there's some concern this morning."
"1143210","1144530"," About this target below. "
"1144990","1147110"," You get this target right where my cursor is down here."
"1147750","1149130"," You can see it right down here."
"1151460","1153780"," You get slightly more sellers than buyers. "
"1154240","1155440"," This is right off the open here."
"1155620","1156920"," Does that mean we don't go up here?"
"1157060","1161340"," No, it just means I'm wary of buying the open here at this point."
"1161620","1164560"," I don't like the idea of there being a target below still. "
"1165200","1166420"," And no target above."
"1166800","1169260"," And even if we do trade higher here, where is higher?"
"1169260","1172460"," I'm not seeing any sell orders that unless they're hidden."
"1174840","1177080"," I'm seeing sell orders at three ninety nine. "
"1177300","1179120"," That's about where where the top is."
"1181530","1184030"," Three ninety three thirty nine eighty five."
"1186390","1189950"," So, so even if we trade higher here, right?"
"1190750","1193930"," It looks like the way is down at some point. "
"1211730","1213090"," So, absolutely, there's some concern."
"1213650","1217690"," So, we're going to look at what we'll do is we'll look around the market, see where everything is,"
"1218450","1220410"," and see if you can find any kind of a direction here."
"1221030","1221430"," There's concern. "
"1221770","1222610"," I've got some concern here."
"1223870","1228770"," Definitely have some concern of a trap down below or some kind of a slight move higher to attempt"
"1228770","1231170"," to close the gap and then it rolls straight down here."
"1234710","1237090"," It's not it's nothing that I want to trade. "
"1238130","1238890"," I'll leave it there."
"1240830","1242010"," It's not that I want to trade."
"1242170","1242670"," I don't like that. "
"1242690","1245870"," I don't like that this magnet down below that's sitting down here."
"1246050","1251370"," There's if this wasn't here and you saw a big sell order much higher."
"1252330","1253870"," There's some coming in right now. "
"1253930","1254530"," There's a little bit."
"1255190","1259350"," You can see on book map three nine eight five is coming in, but that's still not that high."
"1259570","1261330"," That's like up here. "
"1263720","1268420"," You really want to see you really want to see some sell orders on high to get to close the"
"1268420","1268600"," gap."
"1273460","1274560"," Let me see if I can bring up."
"1276340","1278140"," You guys want to see a market profile this morning. "
"1280860","1282500"," Kind of see the demarcation point."
"1282620","1283240"," Give me a second here."
"1283640","1284760"," I'll see if I can bring it up. "
"1301660","1306860"," Yeah, I think this is a five day 15 minute check and make me check the settings on it."
"1313740","1315600"," This is a five day 15 minute chart."
"1315620","1318460"," It seems like we're sitting here right in the right of the top of a shelf. "
"1319040","1323260"," I think this might have been the argument yesterday and weekly timeframe that we would pin here."
"1323340","1327320"," This is a value area low for this move higher here."
"1327500","1328500"," That makes some sense. "
"1328780","1332300"," Let's look at a 15 day sitting into a 15 day 15 minute or something."
"1350110","1354330"," You know, and on a 15 day time period, this looks ugly, right?"
"1355190","1357650"," We start slipping below here."
"1357990","1362310"," Our next node down below is 392. "
"1366480","1371880"," On a yes, which is 3907."
"1373020","1374320"," It's somewhere up here."
"1376680","1377820"," It's right about here. "
"1380320","1383720"," Hold on, I'll show it to you on the main stream."
"1383720","1385760"," That's where this magnet is right here."
"1387560","1388500"," Right down here. "
"1390160","1394260"," That would bring us down to that value area low down here."
"1398600","1403560"," So basically it's saying to you at that minimum, you're going to get, you know, some kind of a move"
"1403560","1405360"," down and higher."
"1405800","1408720"," There's also bids down here to buy. "
"1410640","1415940"," If we start breaking this, though, if we start breaking this area here, it gets nasty, right?"
"1416120","1418880"," You can see how nasty and how light everything is."
"1419080","1421580"," We're talking about that on a larger timeframe too."
"1421720","1433390"," I was telling you about if we start breaking these levels here, we'll back to"
"1433390","1434210"," book map real quick. "
"1434390","1434910"," Hang tight here."
"1435850","1443850"," So if you hang tight here, boys and girls, we're going to pause this book map."
"1444050","1450490"," We're going to look on a five day, right?"
"1450930","1451510"," Hold on. "
"1458820","1460800"," Yeah, maybe it's easier to look on the one month."
"1463140","1464620"," And you can kind of see this."
"1465480","1467520"," You see this magnet down here, right?"
"1469720","1470940"," Where my cursor is. "
"1475000","1479700"," That's saying that is so addictive."
"1482160","1483820"," But just this zone down here, right?"
"1483920","1485720"," You can see this is the end of that node."
"1488300","1494240"," And if you break through that node, right, of support here, it's a far way down. "
"1496000","1504000"," If this is that overall trend that we're in, do you get that brief bloodbath?"
"1511060","1513640"," You get some kind of a bloodbath right down here."
"1517580","1519440"," Do you make this like super green or something?"
"1519840","1524360"," Just, you know, just in case you get that bloodbath down, you break through."
"1524620","1525760"," And this is kind of it right here. "
"1525840","1528160"," It's kind of last stand for bulls."
"1528360","1529340"," They start grinding through this."
"1529340","1531020"," Are we coming to Wednesday and grand through this?"
"1531500","1532880"," It would be nothing for us. "
"1533000","1533980"," It would be nothing for us."
"1534100","1536600"," If we like, let's say we start at some point, let's say it's Wednesday."
"1537200","1541720"," Say we start grinding through this last level here and bear power comes out. "
"1541820","1544060"," It would be nothing to just straight plunge down here."
"1545480","1551160"," I probably want to buy that too, but, you know, just be aware and conscious of this from that, from"
"1551160","1551880"," that market profile."
"1553460","1557460"," That was a five and a 15 day, 15 minute profile. "
"1558240","1559800"," Just be conscious of it."
"1560300","1564500"," We got a bunch of single prints down there way down here that want to get cleaned up."
"1567720","1570380"," You guys tracking along with that kind of stuff with me out there. "
"1571440","1573420"," And we'll take a look around the market too."
"1573600","1578280"," We'll blast around and see what's going on opening the day opening up."
"1578980","1580140"," Take a look at the VIX real quick. "
"1583840","1586000"," And a little bit of a gap down below here."
"1588960","1590820"," But you can see that support, right?"
"1591100","1592960"," Got this nice little juice down here."
"1593700","1595400"," Or I had that buy come in down here. "
"1596560","1599880"," Gap to fill here, but we have some more support here, right?"
"1600420","1603580"," Got this downtrend coming down over here, right?"
"1603680","1604380"," You want to see this?"
"1604520","1609340"," So maybe we get the, maybe we get this push up on the VIX and a rejection to fill this"
"1609340","1609580"," gap."
"1609940","1610500"," That would be nice."
"1611460","1613080"," So we'll keep an eye on VIX up here. "
"1613080","1619780"," We'll write down a notepad somewhere or you want to be looking for some kind of rejection up here"
"1619780","1623720"," around 2262 or so on the VIX."
"1624220","1625880"," Hopefully you get a rejection, fill the gap."
"1626320","1629880"," That would give that gap fill on the on spy SPX. "
"1631340","1634440"," And then the continuation higher back into trend."
"1635640","1639520"," I'd be watching this early morning today, see what goes on with this."
"1639520","1646060"," If you start to see the VIX breakthrough and consolidate for a move higher, that's where we start"
"1646060","1647680"," getting nasty and ugly in the market. "
"1649720","1650680"," Look at the Dixie."
"1658440","1661120"," Talk about this bear town, really the Dixie."
"1661560","1662340"," Jesus Dixie. "
"1663520","1664340"," Oh my God."
"1664520","1666040"," This is this bear town up here, right?"
"1668800","1671180"," This is the money shot for the bears up here."
"1673400","1675300"," And this is supportive, right?"
"1675560","1676540"," The dollar has been supportive. "
"1676800","1678300"," We didn't get what we wanted overnight."
"1679780","1680540"," See this?"
"1680800","1682380"," Let's go to the one day here."
"1683440","1686220"," There's an important key point to be checking this. "
"1687000","1689340"," You really want that."
"1690280","1696020"," You really want that."
"1696020","1698260"," You guys know about dollar liquidity, dollar shortages. "
"1698740","1701720"," And I don't know if you know this from some of you probably do, but."
"1703440","1707600"," There are foreign governments panicking, basically, and ramping up the dollar."
"1708440","1709920"," They're doing it during the daytime. "
"1710180","1711400"," They're doing it at the close of their markets."
"1711440","1712240"," They're doing it overnight."
"1712640","1713780"," Confidence read forecast. "
"1714120","1716800"," One hundred prior one hundred and two spot five."
"1717280","1720440"," The range of one hundred and three spot nine to ninety seven spot five."
"1726660","1731140"," You know, and what they're doing is they're supporting the US dollar. "
"1731320","1735220"," You really, you can't have a rally when we're supposed to be rolling over."
"1735380","1737880"," We're like, Hey, we're way the fuck over bot."
"1738080","1739480"," It's time to pull back a little bit. "
"1740000","1743580"," You're not going to get, you're not going to get a melt up rally with the dollar failing."
"1743940","1745420"," So it's just not going to happen."
"1746060","1749120"," So I mean, rarely you'll see some other outside instance. "
"1752320","1753480"," H Y G, right?"
"1754660","1756180"," H Y G lost that close."
"1756440","1756660"," Yes, sir."
"1756760","1759300"," And H Y G market was being bought into the bell. "
"1760300","1762780"," Fucking bond market into the bell was dog shit."
"1763200","1764080"," Pure dog shit."
"1765500","1767620"," Got a beautiful gap down here that needs to be closed. "
"1768100","1769260"," Bears want this gap closed."
"1769960","1774040"," If there was even an argument for a move higher in the market, but you'd at least want to see"
"1774040","1775900"," some kind of gap closure down here."
"1776660","1778500"," And then a resumption higher. "
"1779680","1783420"," And you could then start arguing, Hey, we're going to start moving the market higher."
"1783460","1787380"," Right now, we're almost like negative gamma starts, right?"
"1787940","1791420"," Star, never negative gamma regime, right?"
"1792440","1794680"," You can see that we're buying futures right now."
"1794740","1796820"," You can see we're selling the cash market right now. "
"1800670","1802270"," Well, there is a gap above here."
"1802530","1804630"," That VIX man, you see this gap here."
"1806170","1807690"," See this nice gap right here?"
"1811170","1815450"," It could be an argument with the VIX to at least have an intraday push up higher. "
"1816650","1819870"," With what this looks like, at least a least H Y G in a 15 minute."
"1822160","1823280"," Close this gap here."
"1823420","1823980"," So I can't say. "
"1825540","1827820"," On a smaller timeframe that."
"1829280","1830380"," There's a chance for."
"1831300","1832540"," The market to go higher. "
"1832540","1835640"," And then we have this gross."
"1836760","1837400"," Look at Jankay."
"1837500","1839300"," Jankay is like fuck you H Y J going nowhere. "
"1840200","1842840"," We're closing this gap down here right down to 90."
"1845160","1849180"," But you know, J and K I guess it stayed on trend."
"1850180","1851300"," Still in trend mode. "
"1853740","1855940"," Kind of some opposing opposing thoughts."
"1857360","1860260"," But go back to, um, see, uh."
"1862440","1864040"," Oh, yeah, that's nice to see oil. "
"1864640","1865600"," Oh, hell yeah."

"2874440","2875520"," How to use them when to use them?"
"2880240","2880600"," Yes. "

"2930460","2933220"," Did you enter here or did you enter here, right?"
"2933360","2935100"," So there's like that layer of."
"2935900","2938120"," The direction that you actually entered the right spot."
"2938300","2941360"," If you entered in the wrong spot, but it's still going up to then let's see. "

"2984780","2985320"," heading higher. "
"2985640","2986260"," Right, does that make sense?"
"2986640","2990380"," So you want to be you want to have a defined path and to where you're headed."
"2990860","2993800"," And a defined time frame for how long you're long."

"3102800","3104300"," Does that make sense to you guys?"

"3161440","3164440"," adding 20 contracts, then you're adding 30 contracts on top."
"3164980","3168720"," Now you're like 50 contracts and then you start coming up to this area here and you're going to"

"3288720","3291420"," You must, over time, learn that stuff."

"3388480","3395560"," And it was, they ended up announcing a split on their ER and it pulled in this shit on the"

"3403820","3411380"," I closed everything the next morning after the year. "
"3411680","3416060"," Bailey agrees with Bank of England's pills for you at the Bank of England is not a fan of ending"
"3416060","3417300"," reserve remuneration."
"3419360","3421520"," And that was like trader discipline, right?"
"3421820","3424200"," Matter of fact, I went to a mentor and said, what do I do?"
"3424500","3425260"," I was in panic mode."
"3425720","3426440"," I was freaking out. "
"3428060","3435400"," It was like my first like large win on size or something with like an ER trade."

"3459920","3466120"," And I'm to this damn grave, I took the money, but had I held that shit because it just kept"
"3466120","3466580"," going up."

"3471220","3473200"," percent like thousands. "
"3473580","3478460"," I should have kept out holding, but I was afraid of the resetting of those options."
"3478880","3480880"," But they would have torched them and then repriced them."
"3481860","3484880"," So you got to have your rules for when you trade my point behind that is have your rules for"
"3484880","3494820"," trading that you feel most comfortable with regardless of regardless of you know"

"3666700","3671920"," I was like, man, I will talk about my rules for fucking zero dates and overnight holding."
"3674120","3678400"," Of calls and shit because I got a bunch of rules because I fucked them up so many times. "
"3679100","3683360"," And yesterday that if you had I didn't buy that bottom, but if you had bought that bottom and wrote"
"3683360","3686180"," it into the bell fucking I would have taken the money and ran."
"3686720","3688660"," That shit went up like 40 fucking percent."
"3688900","3691100"," It was free fucking money for anyone the bottom. "
"3692860","3698220"," I always like the I always like holding the like death into the bell like if we bleed right red"
"3698220","3700460"," bars down at the last minute of the bell."
"3700980","3701900"," Sometimes I'll buy that."
"3703400","3706060"," Sometimes the way we bounced into that bell yesterday, man. "
"3706220","3709000"," I was like, fuck that you take that 40% fucking bounce."
"3710140","3711640"," That's as good as the holding overnight."
"3714820","3716360"," Let me see what you guys are talking about. "
"3718980","3721360"," Yeah, we're trying to grind this up higher."
"3721480","3722500"," We could get a squeeze out of this."
"3722560","3723340"," We're going to get a reversal. "
"3723920","3727460"," What this is going to turn into is a come back to flat on."
"3727460","3729320"," I wasn't paying attention."
"3733020","3734820"," I'm back to flat on my calls. "
"3735420","3742320"," So we're getting here is some kind of a roll over."
"3745420","3751300"," But even in here, if we can break through here, like this is this pivot point right here."
"3751720","3755280"," If we break above this, it's going to be a fucking blast north. "
"3757160","3759000"," It's going to it's going to it's going to fucking rip."
"3759920","3763100"," You can like set up your set up your."
"3765500","3768760"," Set up your rocket ship memes for Twitter right now. "
"3769700","3773720"," And if we if we move right here, if we make this move right here, it's going to be a"
"3773720","3774240"," fucking fate."
"3774360","3774840"," It will be fat."
"3774960","3775480"," It should be fast. "
"3776220","3778300"," If it happens, let's claim it."
"3778300","3778860"," It's going to happen."
"3779340","3782000"," Just letting you know that if we do grind right here. "
"3785890","3787490"," It's going to be a fucking rocket ship."
"3791440","3793240"," So this is when you say tight stops."
"3793320","3794880"," This is the place for tight stops. "
"3796580","3798440"," Because they could red bar straight to hell."
"3799900","3801580"," Come back to a dollar three."
"3801920","3802160"," Yeah, fuck. "
"3802320","3802380"," Yeah."
"3803160","3804780"," Buy my fucking calls, man."
"3808660","3812180"," Not by my calls, but put some premium on my calls by buying calls here. "
"3812180","3812900"," Not you."
"3813180","3813780"," Not if you're listening."
"3813960","3816240"," I'm talking about the fucking general public. "
"3820980","3821920"," That's what I want to see."
"3822020","3824760"," I want to see a bunch of fucking FOMO fucking bulls."
"3826500","3828940"," Pushed up the price of premium on these fucking calls. "
"3830640","3834720"," And I want a bunch of shit ton of puts being bought to rocket fuel it up too."
"3835240","3839040"," I'm watching all these fucking these fucking bears are buying so many fucking puts."
"3839780","3840640"," They're going to put rocket fuel. "
"3840640","3841480"," Let's move up higher."
"3841500","3841880"," Hopefully."
"3854070","3855670"," What do you guys want to know?"
"3855850","3857070"," I'm missing what you guys are saying. "
"3861680","3863020"," Yeah, I can turn the volume up the news."
"3863640","3864020"," Absolutely."
"3865620","3867080"," Big on news volume is a pyre. "
"3872320","3877140"," Yeah, you should have a plan for where to cut, where to add, and where to."
"3877740","3879920"," You have a plan of like I'm going to increase my size."
"3880600","3881460"," Am I going to cut?"
"3881600","3882160"," When am I going to cut?"
"3884100","3887380"," You can put little blocks on your trading, trading app like right here. "
"3887740","3888980"," You should have a defined."
"3890240","3892000"," This is how much I want to make off this trade."
"3892640","3894420"," This is where I want to hold this trade to. "
"3894780","3898440"," You can set alerts on your trading apps for price targets if you're in a."
"3898760","3902020"," But if you don't even want to have a sell, a sell order, you could least have like."
"3902720","3907040"," Hey, I want this stock A to go from $10 to $20."
"3907040","3913080"," Set an alert, please on 1750 and set an alert below the 10 that I bought it at at $8. "
"3913600","3918080"," At least you can go back and check to see if it's going your way."
"3922080","3923640"," Thank you, England's Bailey says."
"3923780","3928200"," I want to observe what happens because of current guilt sales before deciding the scale of the"
"3928200","3929080"," following year's program. "
"3929580","3931140"," Yeah, we're going back up right now."
"3932080","3932700"," We're squeezing."

"3953000","3955400"," Hell yeah, burr baby burr. "
"3961020","3961840"," That's a fair point."

"3967000","3967720"," Good question, Jess. "

"3975210","3975470"," Absolutely."
"3976930","3977290"," Oh, yeah."
"3978990","3981310"," Yeah, I do. "
"3981690","3981950"," I do."
"3981950","3983650"," I did."
"3983810","3984390"," You know, it's fine too. "
"3984490","3987070"," As oftentimes when I don't want to trade, that was the day I should have been trading."
"3988070","3988670"," Oh, yeah."
"3988890","3989230"," Look at that. "
"3989550","3991290"," Oh, yeah."
"3991430","3992750"," Watch out for a reversal up here."
"3992870","3993870"," You see this tag above. "
"3994050","3995110"," You might want to take some off."
"3995230","3995870"," So here's a."
"3997250","3998150"," Here's pro trader."
"3998790","3999330"," Pro trader. "
"3999630","4000450"," As you come up here, right?"
"4001250","4002850"," So you've got this initial move higher."
"4004070","4005130"," The squeeze coming up right."
"4005250","4009130"," We could ping and then start this kind of a thing, right?"
"4010370","4011990"," So you have two choices, right?"
"4012170","4014490"," You can just leave them on until you think where we're going. "
"4015010","4019850"," Or you're going to take it off and then reenter for the second leg, reenter for the next leg."
"4020490","4021590"," You guys understand what I'm saying?"
"4022030","4022530"," Let me go look here."
"4023910","4029770"," So my calls are now at $1.14. And I got to reset all this. "
"4034240","4035220"," Just a second here."
"4036260","4036660"," Okay."
"4038840","4041360"," So I just sold for $1.13. Okay. "
"4042500","4047300"," So now I could get a little bit more off of this, but you figure if let's say we're moving"
"4047300","4047580"," higher."
"4048660","4050420"," For me personally, I like the directional move."
"4050640","4052460"," If there were zero dates, I would have definitely pulled them off. "
"4053300","4057080"," But you want to be like, you want to have defined clear where you're going, right?"
"4057500","4057900"," Take your money."
"4058700","4060100"," And then reenter the trade."
"4061440","4062680"," On consolidation, right?"
"4062820","4064180"," You'll draw a snap a little line wherever. "
"4064900","4066780"," Wherever we top off here."
"4067160","4070740"," And then you'll reenter for the next leg higher if you believe in that next leg higher."
"4070880","4071340"," Does that make sense?"
"4071940","4074400"," And we'll go through this trade today right now as we're doing. "
"4074620","4075540"," We'll go through this trade."
"4076400","4078800"," I can't be in fucking calls while fucking."
"4078900","4079720"," I'm trying to tell you guys. "
"4080780","4081180"," Okay."
"4082240","4085920"," So let's take a look right here."
"4086040","4086200"," Okay. "
"4088840","4090300"," So we'll look at this right here."
"4090960","4092120"," See this little area right here."
"4092660","4094160"," I want you to see where this happens. "
"4094360","4094460"," Okay."
"4095600","4099319"," You're going to set a little line wherever we end up bouncing."
"4104020","4106840"," You're going to put this in place once we ricochet off the top here. "
"4107640","4109540"," And you're going to see some money come off the market."
"4109899","4111140"," Let me get rid of this for a minute till it happens."
"4113279","4114040"," You see that?"
"4114380","4114819"," You see that?"
"4115040","4117420"," You get your fucking rocket chip memes, motherfuckers. "
"4118060","4119439"," Put your fucking rocket chips meme."
"4119660","4122180"," Put your rocket chip meme on fucking meme on fucking Twitter."
"4122180","4126220"," And say, at Captain Jim James or whatever the fuck my thing is. "
"4126359","4129240"," Jet Jim Jame 988 133 or whatever it is."
"4129960","4130700"," Tag me."
"4131300","4132819"," Put a rocket chip on there. "
"4138160","4138680"," Good."
"4140740","4141700"," Dirty dogs."
"4142660","4144800"," Pin strike right there on the pivot point, right?"
"4145399","4147340"," Look at that pin strike right on the fucking pivot point. "
"4148560","4149859"," I like them fucking apples."
"4149859","4157779"," I like that shit."
"4162100","4162819"," Look at that. "
"4163000","4163439"," Swing."
"4167880","4169800"," Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing."
"4170880","4172140"," Beautiful trade right there. "
"4173680","4175859"," Now you're going to be looking for, what are we looking for now?"
"4178020","4179399"," There's our one above, right?"
"4179560","4180200"," Our one's up there."
"4180200","4186420"," So we're going to be looking for one here."
"4189000","4192020"," See if we can reenter the next trade, trade higher. "
"4192340","4196780"," Pounds of four spot one, two, five percent, twenty, twenty seven gilts on December 6."
"4197200","4198580"," 3 9 9 0."
"4199320","4205240"," That is somewhere in here."
"4206680","4208420"," You know, we'll do see this right here."
"4212940","4214380"," Maybe it's up right in here. "
"4216020","4217880"," So let this consolidate a little bit."
"4218580","4219660"," We move this over."
"4219940","4220140"," Hold on. "
"4220760","4226100"," The UK DML also to sell two spot two, five billion pounds of one spot one, two, five percent,"
"4226280","4228980"," twenty, thirty nine gilts on December 6 as well."
"4232160","4233640"," So now what are we looking for?"
"4233760","4236220"," We're looking for a little bit of consolidation."
"4236220","4239500"," And then the next pump higher. "
"4240720","4244620"," So if this consolidates, I'm going to be looking for another leg right around here."
"4245740","4246180"," Okay."
"4249020","4252860"," Would you guys take your fucking money off the table and put it in your fucking pocket. "
"4261690","4263390"," Next those numbers from your handle."
"4263590","4268630"," Yeah, you know what I should have done was, when I first signed, what I did was I didn't know"
"4268630","4269590"," I could have Captain Jay."
"4269590","4270850"," Jim James at Captain James. "
"4271430","4275310"," I like when I was signing up, they just nailed me with that fucking name."
"4275650","4280190"," Just noting that the Bank of England did not know what was going to be in a former UK PM"
"4280190","4280890"," Trust's plan."
"4287500","4289500"," We're looking for some consolidation here. "
"4293700","4295380"," And hopefully another pump higher."
"4297160","4298860"," Just keep grinding it higher now."
"4311950","4313670"," Hopefully don't get stuck in this range. "
"4314030","4314570"," This would suck."
"4315390","4317710"," This would blow if we did this nonsense."
"4319310","4321730"," Like ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong. "
"4322050","4323210"," That would fucking blow."
"4345110","4348830"," See if you can find some consolidation here for another move."
"4352600","4353840"," I'll try to re-enter with you here. "
"4355460","4377990"," I'm going"
"4377990","4380470"," to move myself over here so I can see what the fuck I'm doing."
"4399370","4401510"," Yeah, it really doesn't want to let us above, does it?"
"4402970","4404090"," So what are we looking for here?"
"4404470","4405650"," We don't want to see two things."
"4406010","4411610"," We don't want to see, we don't want to see this go on for like 10 fucking minutes. "
"4411950","4415290"," Sometimes it works out, but we don't want to see a lot of consolidation."
"4416050","4421570"," You want to see like a couple bars for a minute or two, a green bar starting for the next"
"4421570","4422010"," leg up."
"4424030","4426850"," There is, you can see that red bar underneath us. "
"4427010","4428630"," So it looks like we're getting some support here."
"4428750","4429670"," So we'll check this."
"4431090","4437250"," Thank you, England says they sold 346 spot, 4 million pounds of gilts at the sale window for long"
"4437250","4439070"," dated and index linked gilts. "
"4440390","4444510"," We're right at right around 113 right now, 112 on that."
"4444650","4446070"," Matter of fact, let's go back to September 29th."
"4446990","4448530"," We'll get a little more risky here in this trade. "
"4450770","4453150"," Yeah, and they're either doing the same bullshit they did the other day."
"4453370","4458350"," They're actually, we've now we have 118,000 puts on 395P."
"4458630","4463070"," So it looks like they're going to rocket fuel the market up by loading up and all these putts. "
"4464230","4464950"," How do I get out of this?"
"4465230","4467050"," Why am I in different calls and different dates?"
"4468230","4469270"," Clear all this shit up."
"4472410","4472850"," 399."
"4474370","4475690"," Let me look and see above. "
"4478750","4479450"," They're going to want to."
"4479530","4485010"," Bank of England says they received bids worth 480 spot, 5 million pounds at the sale window for"
"4485010","4487070"," long dated and linker gilts."
"4487790","4491910"," Looks like they want you to buy the 397s, which I don't want to fucking buy for 82 cents. "
"4492910","4494470"," Hmm, I don't like that."
"4496610","4498390"," They're fucking trying to tax right now."
"4498390","4500630"," Be careful here because there's a."
"4503530","4509890"," Dealers are like they're trying to tax for this trade and you don't want to be paying 88 cents on"
"4509890","4510410"," a zero date. "
"4510410","4511890"," We're in in the money call right now."
"4517190","4519410"," You're only paying like 60 cents or something."
"4521970","4523170"," 70 cents maybe. "
"4525310","4526630"," Kind of scummy."
"4527570","4528310"," Let me see."
"4528470","4529150"," We'll start with five. "
"4532930","4534110"," Fucking dealers, man."
"4535310","4536690"," It's like discount fucking."
"4557470","4558930"," I'm still flat right now. "
"4562890","4564270"," Yeah, I bought Wednesday's calls."
"4565030","4567230"," I didn't want to hold on here."
"4567790","4569010"," They're still 85 cents. "
"4569250","4570590"," I want to pay the 85 cents for him."
"4571190","4572130"," I want to pay like 70."
"4572570","4573130"," I should have bought him. "
"4573130","4574530"," I'm not buying him."
"4578550","4579770"," I want to see a quick dip."
"4580870","4582050"," I don't like 85 thing calls. "
"4582970","4584110"," I was on Wednesday calls."
"4584350","4585390"," Now I'm on Tuesday calls."
"4585690","4586370"," I'm looking at 397s. "
"4587730","4588530"," They're too pricey."
"4588850","4589190"," They're 85."
"4589730","4590550"," Oh, they're 87 now. "
"4590810","4591630"," I didn't buy them."
"4592530","4596750"," I want like a quick rip down to like 60 or 70 cents and then I'll buy them and kiss"
"4596750","4597690"," my ass and those calls."
"4599110","4603530"," And the reason I'm saying that is the reason I'm saying that is because three 98's one dollar"
"4603530","4603850"," below. "
"4605470","4607950"," So the three 98's are only 43 cents."
"4608090","4611710"," That's a huge disparity in call prices."
"4612110","4616710"," So basically the dealers are telling you is a really good fucking chance that we go up to 397,"
"4616710","4618110"," which we're already above right now. "
"4618670","4623810"," But they're like, ah, there's no fucking chance they're going to three 98, which is right here."
"4624510","4625630"," Tiny little gap right here."
"4625690","4632610"," So you see this little gap back here from is this tiny, tiny little gap right here. "
"4632610","4636170"," They're probably just print the print the 40 cents calls, maybe to 60 cents."
"4638150","4640390"," And the 80 cents calls might get you 10 cents."
"4640690","4641370"," So it's right here. "
"4642330","4645130"," But the trying to tell you is that we're going to roll it right near somewhere."

"4651710","4654790"," Be very wary of a role somewhere right here."
"4656030","4658070"," And maybe it's a fast move then over."
"4658950","4661670"," Looks like it looks like a small trap for reprising. "
"4669360","4670560"," Yeah, I like the gold."
"4670760","4671460"," You know, it's funny too."
"4671480","4674260"," If you like the gold trade, that means you think the market's going up, right?"
"4675580","4676620"," I wonder about that. "
"4676740","4680380"," I sometimes I hear bears talking about the gold trade and I'm like, does that imply that the"
"4680380","4681080"," market's going up?"
"4682420","4682980"," Or no?"

"5254980","5255300"," Good job."
"5255540","5256960"," I didn't like my setup. "
"5264850","5267430"," My calls went from like forty five down to forty two."
"5269470","5273810"," I think I want to prefer to have a bottom at like forty two or a forty one cents."
"5274410","5278190"," I'm not happy with, wasn't having the trade. "
"5317730","5318150"," I'm not happy with the trade."

"5320830","5323170"," I think we're going to get a fuel rally up here today. "
"5323390","5326570"," We've got I'm seeing more and more puts come in."
"5326730","5329250"," You normally like to see zero eight puts come in at that size."
"5330210","5331990"," It's been fueling a move higher. "
"5334970","5336230"," It's a slow move higher."
"5336430","5337090"," This is like a grind."
"5337090","5337630"," Thank you. "
"5337630","5342710"," England's Governor Bailey says long dated and index linked guilds purchases in September and"

"5361780","5362600"," Yeah, you're right. "
"5362780","5363060"," Chunk bonds."
"5363300","5364300"," Chunk bonds looks great."
"5365440","5367180"," H.Y.G. is pointing the way higher. "
"5367360","5371620"," We've got a gap to fill above on H.Y.G. It's starting to grind to that gap right now"
"5371620","5375960"," in H.Y.G. Bonds markets telling you at least positive for a little bit."
"5376140","5379060"," We did get that rejection on the VIX up at twenty two fifty seven."
"5379860","5385360"," Looks like you want to be probably closing calls once the VIX hits somewhere around twenty one"
"5385360","5386220"," sixty seven. "
"5386880","5389020"," Two one six seven look for a bounce."
"5391660","5399240"," It's trying to we can look at VIX real quick if you want, but VIX is trying to it came"
"5399240","5399560"," up."
"5399900","5401840"," Let me see if I can bring VIX up here. "
"5407270","5410230"," Because we just you know it's funny because we talked about this earlier."
"5412740","5418560"," We're going to briefly We're going to do something briefly."
"5419420","5424720"," So we talked about VIX earlier and you know like this VIX trade fifteen minute. "
"5426420","5430740"," Remember earlier we talked about the rejection above here."
"5432440","5438000"," So right off the open I said to you a VIX looks strong until we get up here."
"5440060","5443740"," You guys can always go back, but I was like hey you're going to look at VIX up here. "
"5443920","5445100"," We want to see VIX reject."
"5447300","5453260"," It's kind of like resting bitch face here, but you want to maybe see the gap closed and then a"
"5453260","5454540"," swing higher."
"5455480","5457080"," But this was that quick trade. "
"5458220","5460840"," So you're going to see VIX attempt to settle here."
"5462000","5463060"," Bears want that move higher."
"5464280","5466760"," Bulls want the gap filled down below. "
"5468040","5468980"," For the move higher."
"5469700","5472660"," We did see the rejection at least here like we're looking for."
"5473540","5475120"," This is good to see bullish. "
"5476220","5480920"," That means we have sellers on the VIX trying to dumb the VIX down."
"5482420","5484000"," Released intraday it is bullish."
"5484400","5485900"," So we'll see if this holds right here. "
"5488140","5490640"," Again bulls want to see that gap filled down below."
"5497150","5500110"," HYG pushing up to some cell to a cell area here."
"5500210","5502890"," You can see the resistance here on HYG. "
"5503070","5505130"," So you might have a pause in the market right here."
"5506150","5508970"," Although you do want to see this gap get filled eventually."
"5509630","5515090"," That would be the VIX breaking down and the HYG filling the gap above. "
"5517170","5518310"," See if that can happen."
"5520590","5522030"," We'll take a look at Dixie real quick."
"5524970","5526370"," Where's the Dix baby. "
"5531320","5532540"," Look at that Dix."

"5564990","5565470"," 10678."
"5567170","5568270"," This is not good."
"5579040","5580060"," What time is it?"
"5580160","5580760"," Is it 1130?"
"5580940","5581780"," Are we getting Euroclothes?"

"5692380","5694420"," I don't like this line going down here."
"5694600","5695120"," This is ugly. "
"5695460","5696640"," See this consolidation line?"
"5697160","5700100"," We could go right back down to fucking get go."
"5700100","5701160"," The start."

"5810410","5811990"," I said, I want to buy those at 60 cents. "
"5812890","5814010"," I think they were down there for a minute."
"5835190","5838110"," See if we can get like a, uh, let's take a look at this real quick."
"5844020","5846280"," I'm not necessarily bearish right here. "
"5846480","5851660"," Like I like the idea of like one, kind of a two, kind of a three, and then move higher"
"5851660","5852040"," maybe."

"5859290","5860570"," You know, something like this. "
"5861950","5863950"," Definitely what the bulls want to be hoping for."
"5866710","5874890"," Uh, if you're just looking at cash market, one, two and three, then maybe you move higher."
"5877630","5881550"," If you're not really considering all this shit that goes, that was going on over here. "
"5882550","5887570"," Unless some guys like to just plate or just trade using the actual cash market."
"5890150","5891190"," So keep an eye on this."
"5892430","5894550"," I'm interested in this and kind of a trade here. "
"5897450","5898330"," Maybe like this."
"5900230","5901630"," See where this goes right now."
"5909020","5915520"," To the US after sale, $45 billion in four week bills on December 1st, settling on December 6th. "
"5916100","5916700"," Right there."
"5916800","5917540"," See if we can buy that."
"5920480","5921860"," See if we can get it down here. "
"5924300","5925800"," We make, make another move higher."
"5927000","5928840"," I don't think we're going to get that cheap, but if we can."
"5930180","5931460"," I will take the trade. "
"5933260","5934040"," Hold on."
"5963860","5965520"," Bull's trying to hold VWAP here."
"5968460","5971840"," Uh, man, look at these fucking sellers, man. "
"5972480","5973700"," A fucking book map."
"5974400","5976480"," I need like a shit ton of put buyers to come in."
"5985300","5986640"," Let's see what you guys are talking about here. "
"5986820","5989080"," BB, BB, BBY."
"5990780","5994860"," Seeing decent volume on Apple think here is a good entry for 397."
"5998560","6001460"," Well, you're coming looking at your NQ shorts. "
"6004140","6005700"," Let's look at an NQ real quick."
"6010020","6011780"," Something going on in the queue that I don't see."
"6029640","6030880"," I'm not seeing a."
"6036380","6037400"," I don't know. "
"6037480","6045660"," I'm looking at."
"6052700","6055840"," They're trying to close that gap down below on an NQ."
"6057220","6058440"," I can see the logic here. "
"6059640","6060480"," Someone's bringing up."
"6060740","6062080"," Let's get an NQ real quick."
"6064340","6065680"," Or NDX, I guess. "
"6069220","6070440"," I'm going to say in that they're."
"6077020","6078760"," What do you want that gap held down here?"
"6080100","6081300"," You want this down here."
"6081440","6082320"," Don't show me a mute. "
"6085600","6088720"," I'm going to assume that they want this gap held down here."
"6095240","6096960"," I think that's the target, right?"
"6098700","6100280"," Start closing this gap down here."
"6121910","6123370"," What's the plan down here for?"
"6124910","6126110"," What's the plan down here, friend?"
"6126290","6127230"," So if you close. "
"6128570","6130930"," Let's say you close or start grinding the gap down here."
"6131050","6133930"," We know we've got some push buyers here."
"6136650","6139490"," Get some strength and this strength down in here. "
"6139670","6140750"," I don't know if you close all this."
"6141450","6142090"," You might."
"6143670","6146090"," I'd be more interested in. "
"6148930","6150790"," Closing just that right there."
"6157540","6158920"," Just the white part of this."
"6162340","6164360"," There's a giant fucking gap right here, huh?"
"6165480","6166500"," There's support in here. "
"6166640","6168140"," There's demand somewhere down in here."
"6168960","6169880"," There's some demand."
"6172880","6175020"," There's like unseen demand down in here. "
"6175580","6182360"," I don't know if you get this fold."
"6182540","6185980"," If you think this is a gap, I'm going to bet that some of this gap is fake."
"6187940","6188880"," I like that trade. "
"6190220","6192680"," I can't say I don't like this trade coming down in here."
"6193560","6195720"," I'm filling that gap or partial gap."
"6195980","6196380"," It would be nice. "
"6198840","6201700"," I'd be interested in buying a long hair on tech."
"6204280","6208280"," It'd be interesting if it breaks through and starts grinding through and filling the entire gap"
"6208280","6208720"," down here."
"6214530","6216410"," See how maybe we're going to get some weakness in the spot. "
"6216730","6217330"," Good call out."
"6217470","6218230"," Whoever called out a."
"6219170","6221350"," Whoever called that NDX on chat."
"6224130","6225450"," Oh, yeah, we got a bloodbath. "
"6229940","6231500"," That's strike down below there."
"6232980","6234860"," That strike on 36202."
"6237700","6240020"," Good thing that fucking wasn't long calls. "
"6240060","6241440"," These fucking gangster bears."
"6242900","6245640"," This fucking gnarly fucking bears, huh?"
"6247240","6248700"," This fucking bear is crazy."
"6251480","6252460"," Look at that. "
"6253700","6255140"," Blast right down."
"6255980","6262560"," Look at that nasty blast right down."
"6262680","6263580"," How much it calls right now?"
"6265740","6267840"," The 397 is now 30 cents. "
"6268100","6269420"," They're not even 60 anymore."
"6272280","6274360"," I'm going to probably buy some calls here."
"6277020","6279120"," We can trade this up for VWAP. "
"6282990","6284190"," You had to just see that."
"6288280","6289360"," Did you see the."
"6291340","6294080"," We got the rejection above the rejection right here. "
"6294080","6295360"," I was long calls here."
"6296140","6299000"," And I didn't like the the weakness of them."
"6299140","6300440"," So I closed some calls out here. "
"6300480","6303840"," We ended up fucking rolling started fucking around VWAP."
"6304040","6306220"," We traced this out down lower."
"6307600","6311660"," And that was the target right slammed right down off that line down there. "
"6312260","6313220"," Just fucking."
"6316120","6317700"," Liquidity reset down here."
"6317980","6319400"," Look at that. "
"6321240","6321820"," Nasty."
"6324820","6325860"," Just fucking."
"6326140","6330140"," What do you got to fuck a bunch of fucking bunch of fucking boiler rooms trading today?"
"6332460","6333860"," Look at that nasty. "
"6334540","6336060"," Talked about this move down here."
"6336140","6339120"," If it starts back here down there down there."
"6339140","6339920"," There is oil minister. "
"6340220","6340740"," Counting here."
"6341100","6341760"," Counting here."
"6342020","6346600"," A day by 3 December for refurbished port. "
"6346880","6347620"," Harcourt refinery."
"6348200","6350500"," Probably another probably another rip here."
"6351140","6353440"," One more and then a move higher. "
"6353840","6354480"," Let's see."
"6354620","6356300"," This looks like a trade range at least."
"6356960","6357900"," Something like that. "
"6362160","6362960"," It is through."
"6363420","6364740"," Just through right back over."
"6365280","6368280"," Ticks right allows you to actually hear water flame futures. "

"6373460","6375300"," Let's take a look and see if there's lower targets."
"6375300","6376200"," See we'll look lower. "
"6376800","6377300"," So you've got."
"6378020","6379740"," If you're if you're bearish here."
"6379740","6383720"," That NDX that NDX trade someone's in short. "
"6384540","6385080"," Let's look."
"6387660","6388900"," Hold on if I can do this."
"6391620","6392480"," What I'm in here. "
"6393720","6396900"," If someone says they want to see the gap get filled down below here."
"6397500","6399200"," This is where the magnet is down at 390."
"6399860","6402080"," So we've got some gamma magnet down here 390. "
"6403260","6404960"," So bears are looking."
"6404960","6408080"," So we're below VWAP at this point."
"6408760","6411160"," Let's say they close that gap down below. "
"6411240","6413000"," They want to see this 390 50."
"6413740","6414760"," We'll take a look at."
"6415020","6417240"," We'll see if we can. "
"6429380","6430360"," You've got some lower."
"6430580","6432400"," You've got some lower targets down below."
"6432800","6433900"," Firming up on book map. "
"6436340","6437480"," So we'll see if."
"6438220","6439020"," Show this all."
"6441200","6443380"," We have this lower magnet down below 390. "
"6444200","6445240"," See if they can get it."
"6451280","6456780"," Now Jerry's all minister also says they expect to end importation of petroleum products from about"
"6456780","6458320"," third quarter next year."
"6458760","6463560"," Bank of England's Governor Bailey again says that when we launched guilt purchase program in"
"6463560","6464040"," September. "
"6464240","6467880"," We were within an hour of having a severe problem in the guilt markets."
"6469340","6471340"," It's breaking right through right here."
"6476690","6478130"," We got some targets below. "
"6478290","6480350"," We've got targets below of 3925."
"6480350","6482810"," If this breaks."
"6483190","6487170"," The two OPEC plus sources say the group could consider further oil output cuts. "
"6487570","6492410"," So again, we did hear something along these lines yesterday hearing now from two OPEC plus sources"
"6492410","6495270"," say that the group could consider further oil output cuts."
"6495770","6499350"," You've got targets down below of 3925 and 3900."
"6502170","6503590"," Right down in here. "
"6505590","6506650"," Somewhere in here."
"6514210","6517690"," You know what I always love about these live streams is that you can see if I got my call."
"6517870","6518990"," My balls caught or not. "
"6527900","6532610"," Good thing I didn't have my balls caught in that."
"6532690","6535030"," How many we do that should stream all the time that were."
"6536330","6537350"," I don't like this. "
"6537670","6546310"," Get me out of here."
"6546310","6546970"," A million dollars per day."
"6548330","6550130"," Get some buyers step it in right now. "
"6552550","6553290"," Watch the."
"6555770","6556610"," Watch the."
"6557590","6559590"," The bottom right hand side of book map for. "
"6560250","6562730"," Get a little bit of buyer stepping in right now."
"6568320","6570060"," Almost neutral and buyers right now."
"6570220","6573280"," We'll check the five minute and fifteen minute here see if we get. "
"6574200","6575960"," Some actual dip buyers are not."
"6576560","6578740"," and the volume bar is not quite yet."
"6579940","6580960"," We're not quite there yet. "
"6590980","6592440"," 300,000 on the one minute."
"6610520","6611900"," This looks like it's stepping down."
"6611900","6616440"," The oil minister says we hope to meet the OPEC quota by May next year. "
"6617000","6617960"," I'm going to meet this for a minute."
"6618600","6619920"," We're probably looking lower."
"6619920","6624020"," I'm, you know, there's problems. "
"6624200","6629860"," So we've got this zero gamma hair and the moment we break through it like this, it's very negative."
"6630180","6631620"," We are below VWAP as well."
"6631920","6637720"," We will have a tendency to come back to it, but there is by orders coming in at a lower"
"6637720","6638120"," price. "
"6639660","6642660"," And we've got a magnet down below at 390."
"6644280","6648880"," So you could get your bear suit on here and try to see if we can tag some lower numbers"
"6648880","6649320"," down here."
"6649320","6654640"," I don't expect we trade lower than S2 or somewhere in here, but I would like to see this trade"
"6654640","6655240"," on S2. "
"6655440","6660780"," Let's look at it on a larger time frame here and see we're breaking through."
"6662700","6667920"," I mean, to see this break below, we're out of channel now, just taught this middle, this weekly"
"6667920","6669360"," channel."
"6669700","6674080"," And we're looking for these lower numbers down here, 383, 384. "
"6674740","6679480"," This would be a beautiful target down below here as well, which closes this gap in the S&P 500."
"6680220","6683820"," And then someone brought up the NDX weakness."
"6684580","6686300"," So here's the NDX weakness right here. "
"6687240","6690680"," I think I think they want to see this, at least this part of the gap that closed."
"6691640","6693460"," I'm unsure about the green below."
"6694160","6697340"," Like they want to at least see this get closed or this get closed. "
"6698120","6703160"," I'd be wary of this being sketchy as, you know, are there still buyers here or not?"
"6703160","6704300"," We saw buyers here."
"6706200","6707320"," See buyers here."
"6708500","6712600"," I think the assumption would be that at least buyers will at least step in at least at this level. "
"6713440","6717260"," But there's some kind of like, there's some buying here and there's some more push here."
"6719360","6722740"," It looks like they, yeah, maybe you could close the entire gap, maybe."
"6727300","6728380"," Let me see here. "
"6737560","6743030"," I'm not completely sold on this being the bottom though, for the day at least."
"6746610","6747810"," Not with that kind of a roll."
"6749470","6751430"," They see how they rolled that right over right there. "
"6753130","6755230"," Just said, fuck, no, we're selling this down."
"6755770","6758150"," So if you're a bull out there, what do you take from this?"
"6758350","6758930"," You're taking that."
"6759150","6760330"," There's sellers up here, right?"
"6761290","6761950"," They threw it down. "
"6762090","6762430"," It didn't work."
"6763290","6764270"," Bull's tried to come back."
"6764470","6765830"," They didn't have what they needed. "
"6766610","6767130"," You didn't see it."
"6767890","6768710"," It's still not."
"6768830","6770710"," We're not still not seeing the level. "
"6771030","6774970"," Like we need to see like 200,000 puts, zero to eight puts."
"6775030","6775970"," We're not seeing them close there."
"6776950","6778370"," 177,000 now on puts. "
"6780810","6785710"," So you want to see, when you start seeing like the 180, 220,000, you'll start to see us go"
"6785710","6786130"," back up."
"6787510","6789170"," You see the bulls didn't have it here."
"6789890","6790930"," Traded it straight down. "
"6791290","6792830"," There was kind of a giveaway earlier."
"6793750","6799830"," You could see that giveaway when we started looking at this, if you're, hold on a second here."
"6802590","6807110"," So we originally made this one here and it was like, yeah, I think it was up here. "
"6807110","6808070"," And I was like, that's not right."
"6808350","6810290"," And then we extended it before we even came down here."
"6811450","6812850"," And we did roll over. "
"6813070","6815470"," You saw the weakness in the market as we rolled over here."
"6817130","6818110"," Slammed right down."
"6820750","6824210"," And man, you see new bids are coming. "
"6824370","6825250"," You can look on book maps."
"6825450","6827070"," See that big yellow bar coming in down below."
"6827710","6830910"," What it's telling you is that you've got some stink bids down here. "
"6831790","6834990"," Not stink bids, but just there's now buy bids down below, right?"
"6835190","6835750"," I want it cheaper."
"6836890","6844650"," So 3925, which is right here, right at S2."
"6844970","6846450"," So you've got some bids looking. "
"6847070","6850130"," There are some bids saying, hey, if you come down here, I'll buy some calls."
"6852250","6854770"," Whether they do buy those calls there or not, doesn't matter."
"6854910","6861030"," It matters that there are there are bids now coming to the market trying to tease and coax the"
"6861030","6862510"," price of spy down here. "
"6866130","6867310"," So we'll see if it does."
"6868870","6870190"," You can probably get some puts there."
"6870430","6870910"," That's pretty good. "
"6872750","6879170"," Maybe not right here, but do that throw right over."
"6879450","6882050"," That was nasty move right there."
"6883010","6883830"," Nasty move. "
"6891520","6893260"," We'll try to let's bring this."
"6893520","6895060"," Bring this magnet up here."
"6895300","6903600"," So 392.5 is was that 38?"
"6904660","6905780"," Yeah, that's right here. "
"6906440","6907200"," Might even be lower."
"6907880","6908320"," It's magnum."
"6908340","6909020"," I'd have to go lower. "
"6915410","6915890"," 3948."
"6919920","6920960"," So 391."
"6921640","6922920"," There's a magnet down here. "
"6923080","6927160"," It's like 39123912."
"6930440","6931680"," It's right here at S2."
"6932340","6933120"," Slightly higher. "
"6933240","6933800"," It's like right there."
"6935360","6937260"," There's a definite fucking magnet down here."
"6951940","6958120"," So right around 2 p.m. I'm going to end up leaving stream and watching the USA game today. "
"6958500","6960380"," I'll leave the stream up and running for you."
"6961740","6967340"," But at 2 p.m., I'm going to watch the U.S. I want to see Ariane get fucking stomped."
"6967960","6972540"," I hope we stomp Ariane if you're from Texas. "
"6974180","6975560"," If you sell propane."
"6978600","6980440"," So we got a price target down below."
"6980620","6983080"," We're looking to see if we can get down here. "
"6985400","6988660"," And then we'll look to see if we follow this track."
"6989060","6994800"," So this will extend this all the way down right there."
"6996340","6997540"," That's a vicious move. "
"6997760","6998240"," Look at that move."
"7001430","7003030"," We'll see if this goes down here."
"7004630","7005330"," Nasty move. "
"7005550","7006190"," It continues down."
"7018630","7020310"," Gay bears are in the house today."
"7020830","7022430"," And that's spelled G-E-Y. "
"7024110","7028470"," They get the rainbow flags out flying their pride."
"7029870","7036380"," Yeah, I wasn't in calls."
"7037060","7038000"," I closed calls up here. "
"7038520","7044960"," I closed calls right here."
"7044960","7047800"," You guys didn't catch me and shit."
"7049700","7050980"," He almost did. "
"7051140","7051960"," You fucking had me."
"7052560","7055020"," I can smell it burning on my ass."
"7058240","7059980"," Pay me bulls I wanted all. "
"7060660","7066200"," Here we go trading lore now."
"7066820","7068840"," 390, 39352."
"7070680","7071800"," Hell yeah bears. "
"7073540","7075600"," Let's see some let's see some bear pride."
"7076780","7078340"," We got 39352."
"7079560","7081380"," We got a magnet down below here. "
"7081460","7082960"," Let's see if they can blast through here."
"7086770","7087510"," That's two."
"7088050","7089690"," We're looking at 391. "
"7091510","7093090"," 70 maybe as a price target."
"7093530","7094010"," 391."
"7094150","7099630"," I could be running off by a few pennies on that but 39 in spy it's probably 39172 somewhere right"
"7099630","7099910"," here. "
"7101630","7102190"," 391."
"7102410","7103490"," I don't have that right."
"7104050","7112150"," It's like a dollar 30 difference I think right now between ES and between ES and spy. "
"7113110","7117550"," I think it's like 39172 basically S2."
"7117930","7119210"," This is S2 down here."
"7121250","7124630"," Keep your eyes on this level down here as you make our way down. "
"7130860","7142730"," We'll open up spy a little bit and see this"
"7142730","7144550"," down below if you watch my cursor down here."
"7150200","7152280"," See if the bears can hold on the whole way down."
"7153160","7154640"," Down in hand the whole way down. "
"7156630","7157750"," So we tagged S1."
"7161400","7162980"," Bears one S2 real bad."
"7168760","7174960"," Yeah that's the chase is bringing up something we talked about this morning was that if you break"
"7174960","7176520"," if you start breaking that S2. "
"7178580","7180600"," We were looking at the market profile this morning."
"7180720","7185760"," If you start breaking S2 it's fucking single prints all the way down."
"7189100","7191660"," Single prints all the way the fuck down. "
"7192660","7194180"," 383 here we come."
"7202830","7206870"," Should we make this line red to get the bears all pumped up?"
"7207750","7211570"," I think I'm all look at that big red line."
"7212350","7213630"," Oh look at that. "
"7216850","7218530"," Let's turn some bears on."
"7219950","7223530"," Blood red candles to the depths of hell."
"7224150","7225270"," Send me down there cap. "
"7226250","7228670"," We should probably change the length of it though."
"7229370","7230550"," We want an actual target."
"7231570","7232490"," Right there. "
"7233990","7235170"," Blood red captain."
"7240190","7241270"," My zero dates."
"7241530","7243930"," My zero date 390p's going back to life. "
"7244810","7246810"," Looks like we're going to tag somewhere down here."
"7247050","7249470"," 361 72 is where I suspect."
"7250510","7251450"," Not our 71. "
"7251930","7253350"," I don't know if I have this exact exact."
"7253570","7255110"," It's like within a fucking 10 pennies."
"7255780","7257710"," I think it's 39172. "
"7261630","7265970"," Don't don't quilt me on like a fucking 10 penny target."
"7268720","7270120"," Blood red bar is kept."
"7271620","7274580"," Should we change the we'll change the color to blood red. "
"7276380","7278000"," We don't want pink red and fusion."
"7278480","7279560"," We want blood red."
"7281500","7285340"," So if you're a bear what you want to do is you want to see a rejection and then the"
"7285340","7287760"," move down here in just this big old tag. "
"7288940","7293620"," If you didn't get on the bear train yet and you're looking for some entry you want to see this"
"7293620","7294460"," move right here."
"7294620","7295800"," You want to see a rejection."
"7296960","7300920"," You got a whole line here for us to get the rest of the move. "
"7301760","7303580"," We want blood."
"7304320","7307740"," Big giant blood."
"7310820","7313660"," Blood rain from the top over here. "
"7317270","7317830"," This is terrible."
"7320450","7321590"," Blood depths of hell."
"7323330","7324750"," Bear is going to hold this right here. "
"7325430","7325910"," This is the truth."
"7326110","7327070"," I'm not fucking around this one."
"7327730","7328690"," If we get a bounce here. "
"7328830","7329610"," Bear is going to hold this."
"7329870","7330450"," Take this down."
"7330850","7331510"," Slam down on this. "
"7331570","7332410"," That's two if they can get it."
"7335520","7338660"," Let's see if we can see if that happens."
"7340560","7344520"," I'll get rid of this red bar so you can trade this and not have to look at red bar. "
"7345640","7347300"," The bears want to be holding this right here."
"7348440","7349020"," Right there."
"7349860","7350740"," You want to hold that. "
"7360910","7361770"," You in here Joey."
"7362690","7363750"," Joey harbors in here."
"7365150","7366490"," Joey if you're in here right. "
"7366810","7368510"," If I could close some calls like right here."
"7369170","7371890"," Somewhere in here I close some calls and was like I don't like this."
"7372750","7373270"," Fuck it. "
"7373390","7377310"," Then we went looking around the market and I came back and it was already fucking her getting all"
"7377310","7377610"," angry."
"7378090","7378830"," Like Jesus."
"7379330","7384610"," Someone called out N.D.X. and was like I got an N.D.X. short and I want to"
"7384610","7387150"," fucking murder fucking murder tech right now. "
"7387550","7388210"," He's like a blood."
"7388410","7390230"," He's like a blood wish inside of the chat."
"7400820","7402720"," If I see no red fine played B."
"7405960","7407820"," Yeah, I'm probably going to watch the game like to. "
"7407960","7412780"," I'm hoping that so what I'm hoping is that whatever moves made today that the market just gets"
"7412780","7417040"," quiet at 2 p.m. I'll leave the stream up and running for you but I mean how can you"
"7417040","7418320"," not watch USA today?"
"7418960","7419340"," Come on."
"7419380","7420240"," It's like every four years."
"7420440","7421780"," I mean I can't stand guitar. "
"7422200","7422600"," Fuck them."
"7423000","7428240"," Fuck by FIFA too but you know I like a couple of picks."
"7429140","7429480"," We did. "
"7429620","7430960"," We're doing like a round robin format."
"7430960","7432340"," My wife and I and the kids."
"7433080","7434620"," Like what's your favorite team?"
"7435340","7437460"," And then of course what's your pick to win?"
"7437460","7441760"," And then each round we're picking each round and count points that way as well. "
"7444120","7445520"," There's one to hold this up here."
"7445680","7446660"," There's two spots for entry."
"7447140","7449500"," So if you're taking profit here in S1 you're looking for S2. "
"7449940","7452040"," There's two places to reenter for another short."
"7452280","7453700"," If you want to be here you want to be right here."
"7454360","7457500"," So these are these are your two places to enter the next leg down if we get it. "
"7458640","7463300"," If you are thinking that's bottom as a bull you want to be checking a you want to be checking"
"7463900","7464860"," and we'll check it right now."
"7465000","7465240"," We'll look."
"7465520","7471340"," So you want to look on a five-minute chart right and you're just looking for some volume. "
"7472320","7477320"," You've got 1.25 million and 180,000 on a five-minute chart."
"7477900","7479440"," You want like a three to five million."
"7479840","7482200"," You see on the 15-minute you're not quite seeing it yet. "
"7482480","7487120"," You'll be seeing dip buyers come in here but you really want to see like a hammer candle like three"
"7487120","7488140"," million five million."
"7489080","7494960"," Now every we might go up here we could we could blast hire and you say cap the three million"
"7494960","7495880"," five million didn't work."
"7495880","7496840"," It's not a question of that. "
"7496840","7499820"," It's a question of a question of rules right."
"7499940","7504120"," So you place a rule and you say every time it hits three to five million hammer candle I can"
"7504120","7506040"," confidence usually by that bottom."
"7506240","7510240"," So you might miss some great trades but you want high confidence trades right. "
"7510680","7515060"," So if you're going to take a bottom by you're looking for a base to build here."
"7515420","7521980"," You're looking for three million volume buyers here and then you're looking for five million on a"
"7521980","7522560"," 15-minute."
"7523280","7526300"," So you're just looking for these like every check mark box right. "
"7526420","7527040"," What am I doing next?"
"7527200","7527700"," What am I doing next?"
"7528800","7531120"," People are asking about stops earlier on Twitter."
"7531340","7532180"," People are asking about rules."
"7532940","7536580"," People are asking about rules about zero dates holding one dates overnight. "
"7537540","7539040"," What are your rules for that kind of stuff?"
"7540880","7542460"," So I don't think this is bottom yet."
"7542640","7545920"," I don't think this is enough volume in this little area right here."
"7546940","7548360"," So I want to see more volume. "
"7548640","7549480"," I want to see more volume buyers."
"7549600","7552620"," Now the other thing you can check is the dome right or the order flow or the order book."
"7553320","7556280"," You can check the order book on you know you can do it on take a swim. "
"7556520","7560020"," I think we believe it has an order book you can look at but the bottom right hand side of"
"7560020","7565240"," the bottom down here you kind of want to see more buyer step in and then sellers."
"7567480","7571940"," And right now you've got more sellers than buyers right so any any trade higher we said this"
"7571940","7572660"," earlier this morning."
"7573160","7578520"," Jess asked he said hey if there's more more sellers than buyers and Tesla's going up what does that"
"7578520","7578920"," mean cap?"
"7579380","7584740"," And I said hey I said that typically means that we're in a short squeeze but we're not in an"
"7584740","7586380"," accumulation phase right. "
"7586620","7588180"," We're not buying for a move higher."
"7588800","7594300"," We know that the biggest moves higher on low volume but we do want to see that initial volume grab"
"7594300","7597260"," to form some kind of a base."
"7597580","7599500"," We are starting to roll it over real quick right now too. "
"7600080","7602580"," And we also have some bids much lower right."
"7602760","7608840"," You see the bids in the market on book map down at the magnet down at 3925 and there's probably"
"7608840","7618630"," one even lower so we'll look lower on book map real quick and see that"
"7618630","7621930"," down below see that 3900 down there that's starting to form up."
"7622470","7624790"," This is telling you this is telling you right. "
"7625630","7635220"," So when they talk about stepping down the market it's talking about you've got like so let's bring"
"7635220","7635540"," this in."
"7635820","7640300"," So you got hold on let me get rid of this book map permit."
"7640700","7647120"," You guys see book map right but what book map is telling you is that you've got some standing"
"7647120","7650960"," orders coming in the market recently coming into the market saying hey I'll buy this down here"
"7650960","7651240"," right. "
"7652420","7656720"," So the markets you know the market wants to go up and down depending on where the buys and sells"
"7656720","7661520"," are more but more buys or more sells above than buys below it's going to head up there to get"
"7661520","7663320"," get sellers sent to the market."
"7663560","7668120"," You have more buyers down below it's going to want to head down here right."
"7668360","7673860"," And so when it heads down here let's say you're filling all these buy orders and then more buyers"
"7673860","7682180"," show up down here it has three and there's no sell orders higher up here it will continue to move"
"7682180","7687840"," down this is called stepping down the market right and you'll see us step this market down now one"
"7687840","7689520"," level at a time it's mechanical. "
"7690860","7695660"," Some people say there's stink bids but this is all algorithmic selling right they'll sell to a"
"7695660","7700480"," level they'll put more buyers it more buy orders down here as soon as they get down here right"
"7700480","7705440"," they'll remove those buy orders and you'll see this big yellow bar red bar come out come in on book"
"7705440","7710480"," map even lower and they'll step down each each level now do I think we get below us today I"
"7710480","7716940"," don't know maybe maybe maybe not I'd prefer to see us get down below these levels or break"
"7716940","7722440"," breakthrough on Wednesday when pop a bear power comes out supposedly maybe he knows something that"
"7722440","7729680"," we don't know so if you bear same place right you're looking for looking for a reentry here reentry"
"7729680","7737200"," here for the roll over to this next level down we'll see if we get it and we're going to"
"7737200","7741460"," take a walk around the market right now let's look at the five minute one more time see if we're"
"7741460","7748690"," getting a base interest or the volume down here we're going to 15 minute"
"7750520","7761660"," it's not that good they had three million cells down here this isn't"
"7761660","7771820"," bad in a five might"
"7771820","7781820"," be a small long trade in here small three minute five-minute trade maybe I'm not buying that"
"7781820","7792070"," shit though fuck no another"
"7792070","7797650"," way you can tell in here if this is the bottom is another good way to just check on the"
"7797650","7801610"," if you're like hey I want to buy let's say you're like pick up normally I would buy this right"
"7801610","7806910"," here one cool thing would be to look inside the options chain if you start to see the options gain"
"7806910","7814470"," some serious premium it'll be another like not primary indicator that this is some kind of a trade"
"7814470","7826180"," higher oftentimes you'll see oftentimes if this is not a bottom you'll see you'll"
"7826180","7832200"," see this move this leg higher to here or even to here and let's see about a call it like"
"7832200","7837480"," let's look at some call let's let me look at some actual calls so let's see about like uh let's"
"7837480","7842740"," say you're looking for this trade right here it's 395 so you buy some 395 C's they cost right now"
"7842740","7852100"," 53 cents if you start seeing them go from like 53 to like 50 59 or 60 cents in here"
"7853640","7858880"," or maybe they and then they lose value and then they go from 50 they max out at like 60"
"7858880","7862760"," cents in here something like that's showing you that no one's interested in this part of the trade"
"7863300","7869260"," if you start seeing these 50 cent calls going like 50 cents 60 cents 70 cents as we're moving up"
"7869260","7875040"," to these levels it's showing you that there's real interest in buying for this leg higher so that's"
"7875040","7881220"," why i watch options chains uh to see if if we're getting actual like a real this is a real"
"7881220","7889040"," this is just a short covering or is this a real a real true bottom does that help i don't"
"7889040","7902400"," know if that helps or not um and let's look um see"
"7902400","7915620"," if we can move this see"
"7915620","7926390"," if that helps let me know what you think in the chat yeah"
"7926390","7930230"," i'm not i'm not interested i mean we could trade this for five we could do it five-minute trade"
"7930230","7934710"," here we could do a five-minute trade for this level right here we could do a five-minute trade"
"7934710","7940090"," for this level right here and then we could keep keep taking that trade higher but not on stream"
"7940090","7949940"," right now i don't want to i don't want to trade that on stream with you guys you can"
"7949940","7954300"," trade it on stream or you you know you can trade it i don't want to trade it with you"
"7954300","7974850"," guys live yeah"
"7974850","7980930"," i want to see i think jade markis was talking about that uh so just some guy brought up a"
"7980930","7990030"," point uh there's an argument being made out there right now that uh the moment i think i don't know"
"7990030","7993810"," if i have this right or not but i think i think he was saying or someone out there was"
"7993810","8001530"," saying uh that after month then you might see a ramp so if you're looking for that December trade"
"8001530","8010850"," you might be looking for it on December 1st well for that long trade you're looking for a monthly"
"8010850","8019060"," end opex uh well i don't want to trade it live it's a really it's a really fast trade i"
"8019060","8025980"," i trade this sometimes like i'll trade these bumps up i'll trade this right here and then if we get"
"8025980","8030120"," above here i'll trade this live right here this is more for you to do in your own i don't"
"8030120","8035160"," want to do it live because the delay in time in this the you have to be really fast in"
"8035160","8041300"," these trades um sometimes they don't produce a lot they only produce pennies two three four pennies"
"8041300","8046720"," five pennies stuff like that and i'm not interested in people getting shaved for three four five"
"8046720","8056390"," pennies on a live stream you're talking about"
"8056390","8062390"," you're talking about you're having to be really fat a really fast trader there aren't that many"
"8062390","8072270"," there aren't that many fast traders if you wanted to trade higher i mean there are"
"8072270","8078910"," three places right you took you you trade this level right slam you trade that one and then you"
"8078910","8083990"," trade that one higher guess there's another place up here there would be to be your vol zone right"
"8083990","8093350"," here but uh i'm not interested in trading that with i'm not just not the safe trade would be you"
"8093350","8098650"," know you wait for this wait for that and you wouldn't actually take the trade until right here"
"8098650","8114180"," that's the safety trade if you're bullish here some confirmation that you're going higher and"
"8114180","8117720"," even then look at that rejection right off the pivot point you guys see that rejection right there"
"8117720","8127020"," off that pivot to trade that right up right there a pinged pivot and they said fuck you know damn"
"8127020","8143420"," straight down i almost pin strike up there this"
"8143420","8147680"," is where the beers want to this is where the beers want to start start a position the beers have"
"8147680","8152600"," two places to start a position so if you're a bear right what do you do here let's let's help"
"8152600","8158300"," bears out from it so let's say you missed this trade here as a bear it rolled too quickly um"
"8158300","8162720"," if i if i was taking a put or a short position i would want to start position here a"
"8162720","8171180"," small position let's say get like five five puts right uh or a short here right and i would have"
"8171180","8176080"," these would be the two levels that i'm looking for somewhere in here if you start if we start to"
"8176080","8180860"," trade above here you know you have a stop loss right up here all right you don't want to be"
"8180860","8187160"," seeing this move higher now there is there could be uh there could be an argument made for a bear"
"8187160","8192520"," to say well i'd start a small position here cap i'd add to my position here cap and then this"
"8192520","8198860"," pivot point would be my stop loss above uh you get like five contract not well the es mini you'd"
"8198860","8203620"," be like you know a contract or two another couple of contracts and then up here you'd be looking"
"8203620","8210020"," for that that move down so this would be risk tolerance what kind of risk uh you're trying to take"
"8210020","8216000"," on because you are bearish up into this pivot point anything below is pivot is bearish anything"
"8216000","8225680"," down here is super bearish i think it helps bears out or not some bears that are"
"8225680","8232420"," conservative would say i'm not going to take any short position until we're up here so my first"
"8232420","8238120"," position my first short is up here you know so i understand all that if you're a bear and that's"
"8238120","8243740"," how you trade this would be the most conservative or whatever you did this every time you probably"
"8243740","8248580"," get that that's how that got thrown over over here you know like really conservative that's where"
"8248580","8254459"," the first one happened um you know if you're like i'm just gonna slam it down every time i get"
"8254459","8258379"," up here if i miss a trade i miss it but at least i got this this beautiful payday over"
"8258379","8273120"," here if you're aggressive bear you like right there cap that's where it's at you"

"8345340","8351180"," trade outside of a pivot point like self capital levels on pivot points uh support resistance to"
"8351180","8355520"," for trade with and range uh if we start to break out we'll start looking at the ascotastic"

"8364580","8369740"," market profile and then book map into the whole entire mix so we'll look to see where the single"

"9819190","9828650"," looking at it from the perspective of like job home and shelter and uh way to get to work there"
"9828650","9834430"," are people out there yeah if you if you live through like oh if two thousands are eighty six eighty"
"9834430","9840930"," seven or sorry eighty seven eighty eight or i don't know even earlier or uh two thousand or two"
"9840930","9845670"," thousand seven two thousand eight there's one fascinating thing that takes place uh during a market"
"9845670","9851510"," crash and uh that is that people keep their cars they'll lose their house they'll lose their wives"
"9851510","9857010"," they'll lose their kids they will fucking sleep in their car so they can go to work every day even"
"9857010","9865860"," they got a shitty job uh and so everybody's you know everyone wants to point and look towards the"
"9865860","9871400"," housing as you know where's it gonna be where where's the where's the break gonna be in the economy"
"9871400","9880020"," i'm so fascinated right now with uh thinking that it's possibly in the auto industry and not"
"9880020","9886580"," necessarily new car market but the used to new car market that there could be a way where used cars"
"9886580","9892640"," cost too much money you trade in though isn't that good and the new car price is a lot of"
"9892640","9897980"," reach and you're so like there's one thing to be upside down in a vehicle in order to get in"
"9897980","9907920"," that next little touch up here we also have more buyers and sellers still right now um so we've got"
"9907920","9911360"," some accumulation going on in the market we'll see if this holds up coming into that second"
"9911360","9917400"," resistance point and the first one right here in my cursor is the second one right now and we do"
"9917400","9926980"," see some accumulation uh this does not look like a short squeeze usually you'll see a squeeze up"
"9926980","9934520"," like this and you'll still see more sellers than buyers so topically it it looks like some"
"9934520","9941400"," accumulation here uh but the thing that i'm looking at like they're like you go you buy a car let's"
"9941400","9945140"," say you buy a car for ten thousand dollars and they always tell you you drive it off the lot"
"9945140","9951780"," and it loses two thousand twenty percent of its value right and then uh three four five years later"
"9951780","9956080"," you're going to turn it in and it's lost forty to sixty percent of its value you've done the good"
"9956080","9962900"," up keep on it you've taken it for checkups and all that kind of stuff I think like I felt"
"9962900","9966840"," like a no seven oh eight oh nine somewhere in there things were getting a little ridiculous was"

"10004360","10009380"," we're not negotiating the sticker price oh and we're going to slap down lots that are slapping"
"10009380","10014320"," another twenty five thousand dollar mark up on their truck there's this like real really weird gray"
"10014320","10019280"," area where if you get a guy or a woman or whatever they have a job that's making i don't"

"10030960","10038080"," 120 000 140 000 and it comes time where the trucks getting old and they want to turn it in"
"10038080","10044800"," and then new and then that new price that shit is still going on and then they'll use market uh"
"10044800","10049920"," there's no buyers for that truck even though it's got a high use sticker value but there could be"
"10049920","10055520"," this moments where it's like holy fuck i'm upside down to forty thousand dollars in my truck i've"
"10055520","10061660"," lost my house lost my wife and kids i got repairs on it they're through the roof i wonder if"

"10143860","10153520"," just some guys talking about it right now you know i don't know uh"
"10153520","10158920"," so we have we have a lot i'm telling you right now we got an accumulation ramp you look down"
"10158920","10162000"," you look down that bottom that chart right there that green and red side there is accumulation"
"10162000","10168500"," going on right here i told you earlier if you wanted to take this trade you trade the levels you'd"
"10168500","10174020"," be disciplined at all times you could trade this level you could trade this level and then you"
"10174020","10179120"," could look to trade this level um can we roll over here yeah you start putting stops on if you"
"10179120","10182720"," take a position here and you want to take this next look you have stops on right here for a"
"10182720","10186860"," roll right so if we start rolling below it uh your audio position right so if you have a long"
"10186860","10191640"," bias here i have a long bias here let's look around the market too we'll see if we should have"
"10191640","10195860"," a long bias but if you have a long bias here we've had two tags right perfect tags you had"
"10195860","10205280"," a tag right here tag right here right we got a tag right here right came up slammed up and"
"10205280","10209840"," tagged right here right so let's think like i got a long bias here cap we've got accumulation going"
"10209840","10214560"," on i'm gonna buy this so you can buy this you buy some but you look for a place for"
"10214560","10221780"," accumulation look at this gonna close the time frame you're gonna look for some accumulation here a"
"10221780","10227700"," little bit of this kind of thing for the move high right so you're gonna say all right cap i"
"10227700","10233040"," want to i want to buy this move higher so you're gonna look to enter at the right place so"
"10233040","10241500"," probably right here right so you're gonna want to be buying calls somewhere right here you want to"
"10241500","10246220"," have to you want to have at least at least in your mind uh if we get one more quick"
"10246220","10251700"," dip and rip i can stay in or add to my position so you're gonna probably use this yellow line"
"10251700","10259700"," as your stop loss if you have that long bias okay you want to make this trade higher if you"
"10259700","10266740"," think we're blasting through and how long do you take that trade well if we bounce right away if we"
"10266740","10270360"," bounce right away here i'd have a price target about right here right right where this where this"
"10270360","10276760"," vwap comes in right take your money hopefully you can trade the next leg up over here if uh you"
"10276760","10281440"," break if we break down right here you can say i'm going to add to my position twice right and"
"10281440","10288760"," you'll still have that same that same spot right about there okay uh hold on a second let me drink"
"10288760","10297240"," my coffee let's say you're considering this trade you're like okay i'm considering this trade cap i"
"10297240","10302200"," want to take this trade cap all those grind into place i want to want to take this long we'll"
"10302200","10310900"," really quickly look around and see is this is this trade setting up or not here goes that bounce"
"10310900","10320020"," off ndx ndx setting up a flag this looks like a bull flag this does not look like a um"
"10320020","10326780"," bearish let's say it wants to go up it's got some room to go up at least right that's positive"
"10326780","10336720"," for you we'll take a look at uh junk bonds junk bonds telling you the moves up and see"
"10336720","10343340"," that right positive for you got a little bit of a push at bonds telling you're going up here that's"
"10343340","10350240"," positive for you it looks like we get a roll here this looks this looks bullish i mean it looks"
"10350240","10356960"," like you can get a roll here maybe we'll get a nice little roll again get this stuff coming up"
"10356960","10366680"," here maybe it maybe you got a short little spurt in the spy let's take a look at dixie"
"10366680","10373040"," and dixie man this fucking day we want this to come down i mean dixie could help you coming down"
"10373040","10380060"," here at least maybe till four pm see the four pm right here maybe we get a little bit of"
"10380620","10388000"," push into the bell kind of bullish seems like the seems like the uh the crystal balls that"
"10388000","10395600"," everybody uses uh so you're getting some you're getting some uh you're getting at least some"
"10395600","10400400"," information saying you guys can't see that shit huh i should have muted all this i want to say get"
"10400400","10406440"," it we'll go back and look at it one more time it's like ndx right there's a 15 minute chart"
"10406440","10413920"," ndx get a little bit of a at least a small bullish flag on ndx right this is kind of"
"10413920","10419340"," helping your helping your thought process out right so could we at least at least trade it up here"
"10419340","10426660"," sure ndx looks like it can trade higher that's positive for you taking along here we'll take a look"
"10426660","10433520"," over at uh what was the next one we looked at junk bonds junk bonds is telling you the way"
"10433520","10438180"," is up right how far away up is junk bonds possibly at least to the close here maybe even extended"
"10438180","10442680"," into the close here right so that's telling you little bit of positive it's a bounce here going on"
"10442680","10451920"," junk bonds hyg same kind of a thing right found some support looking to close this gap above we do"
"10451920","10456340"," have some resistance above here this is a kind of a danger zone right here it might be a place"
"10456340","10462380"," to stop and then make the next leg to close this above here this gap above on hyg so it's"
"10462380","10472000"," it's kind of positive vix right we we came up here right came up here rejected just rejected again"
"10472760","10476420"," so there might be a little bit more room or the way it might actually be down for the vix"
"10476420","10481720"," for temporarily at least that's on your that's kind of on your side too so you get all these all"
"10481720","10487880"," these you get dixie right that's like a dixie it's in this channel it's respecting this channel but"
"10487880","10492620"," dixie has a little bit more room than it could get on right so there's some stuff on your side"
"10492620","10497800"," for a push higher so if you quickly run through the market take a look at everything the market's"
"10497800","10506140"," telling you come back into the spine you say hmm when you see the accumulation you say yeah you"
"10506140","10515400"," know what cap well there's a chance there's some there's some other indicators out there they're"

"12292840","12297340"," like one third eleven thirty or something then we'll start rolling it back down and like like one o "
"12297340","12303960","'clock we'll start rolling back down we didn't get it so the more we go down we should close it"
"12303960","12308800"," at some point you keep doing this bull shit just down and down you leave that gap up there if"
"12308800","12318600"," this if this lasts into if this lasts into tomorrow and like j-pow comes out i you i know"
"12318600","12327380"," bulls are going to be just begging to close this gap at some point just begging again for it it's"
"12327380","12340210"," just going to be too juicy not to deny we see"
"12340210","12348380"," that the bears can uh bulls can hold this here man bulls are looking fucking weak as shit bulls are"
"12348380","12355540"," not doing it rejection again someone was talking earlier about turning this into resistance so this"
"12355540","12360060"," support man you don't want to see this happen and you want to see consolidation you don't want to"
"12360060","12367060"," see rejection off of this uh off of this made this is a major shelf right i shouldn't say zero"
"12367060","12377740"," gamma zero gamma should i should just write that but that should just say shelf on it that's what"
"12377740","12395240"," it is bears"
"12395240","12402180"," trying to fucking totally turn this into a fuck you were going down i want a 15 day bloodbath"
"12402180","12412170"," that's what the freaking bears are saying no it's not well not only is"
"12412170","12416430"," it not a v-wap but i mean you figure we've been trading under v-wap now for two days"
"12416430","12424750"," right now three days so i know figure from friday basically friday close into today we've been"
"12424750","12430610"," under v-wap and not only under v-wap but you know a longer time period let's look at a"
"12430610","12439310"," longer time period so we we do start getting more bullish start seeing these moving averages right"
"12439310","12443090"," you start seeing this blue one up here is 200 i mean you're talking about a huge fucking gap up"
"12443090","12448670"," here to close really come back into even if you reject off it just when you start trading below"
"12448670","12453890"," this stuff right when you start trading start seeing this blue line up here right the more we trade"
"12453890","12458930"," down and away from it the more it wants to come back to it so it's more and more bullish"
"12458930","12462930"," as we trade away from it the more you forget the v-wap at this point and this is going"
"12462930","12469210"," back into friday here right start trading down here you start stretching sometimes you'll hear guys"
"12469210","12473850"," call this stretching you keep stretching and stretching the more that you stretch away from moving"
"12473850","12479950"," averages so the larger the whip saw up is going to be does that make sense so it gets more"
"12479950","12488800"," and more bullish the more we trade down you know so at some point there's going to be a slingshot"
"12488800","12496760"," effect that no seller is going to be able to fuck with is it was it down here there is"
"12496760","12503720"," it even lower is the question you can say whatever you want I mean once some once in a while"
"12503720","12509860"," we have we'll have like a day we lose 500 points in Nasdaq or the Dow or whatever fucking I"
"12509860","12516900"," shouldn't say 500 points the Dow 500 points in a day but if you have the more we start stretching"
"12516900","12522600"," down lower if we reject here let's see I'm making another leg lower at some point we're going to"
"12522600","12567950"," get a violent fucking hammer candle it's going to fucking fly yeah"
"12567950","12572090"," like I like the idea of trading a v-wap on intraday well you start stretching out and moving"
"12572090","12581740"," averages on them on a five days or you know ten days you start getting to extremes like nine days"
"12581740","12585760"," you remember it's like nine days are in extremes sometimes eleven or twelve will be over extension"
"12585760","12595460"," but you start stacking these days up down days well fucking promise you you're gonna see a"
"12595460","12628910"," nasty whipsaw yeah"
"12628910","12636090"," 394 area was the was the springboard yeah we saw one of those days last week right we sold off"
"12636090","12642110"," like bloody hell into the close fucking went up like 200 points for something insane it was like"
"12642110","12646710"," 150 points 200 points like the next morning right off the bell we didn't see that off this bell"
"12646710","12655490"," though you know the bear it bulls are kind of fucking weak here it's that it's not all that"
"12655490","12664330"," volatility on Wednesday Thursday rightfully so we get some but nasty numbers coming out not nasty"
"12664330","12676270"," but potentially nasty numbers coming out on Wednesday Thursday oh"
"12676270","12683760"," yeah I scalped like a I scalped live here all the time I scalped all the time here do you"
"12683760","12691870"," ask anyone in the stream I'm always scalping I love scalping I usually make a I usually try to make"
"12691870","12697550"," like a one to three month trade my bread and butter and then I try to scalp trade as of"
"12697550","12705650"," late at the past I think I stopped trading most of my overnight holds on zero dates well"
"12705650","12715230"," I think maybe summer time spring time no last winter it was last winter I stopped doing overnight"
"12715230","12723410"," zero zero day trades but this whole year it's been mostly like um um me to my trades are I'll"
"12723410","12735720"," share me to my trades I'll just"
"12735720","12743100"," use like a I just basically is a breadth a breadth indicator a price percent oscillator and I'll"
"12743100","12751700"," I'll buy those huge dips and I'll buy the I'll sell those huge tops all year long with a spread"
"12751700","12757440"," and that's where I get me to the most the most of my money comes from those I have lost"
"12757440","12767280"," one big I did lose one big trade this year and then I zero date scalp mostly one date"
"12767280","12777960"," zero date scalp some role"
"12777960","12787290"," in the VIX right now I think as we get more volatile"
"12787290","12794770"," as the market becomes more volatile it's it's challenged trade these markets for sure just to come"
"12794770","12806250"," it's become harder and harder and harder past hmm past two years I've"
"12806250","12817640"," been condensing and condensing condensing my trading hold"
"12817640","12870260"," on here I"
"12870260","12874580"," use futures too so I used to trade futures I don't like being awake all night long now I only"
"12874580","12882280"," use futures on a long long to the few things so some rules we talk about this frequently so puts"
"12882280","12888420"," are only built for one-to-one trades okay they're not built to hold value they're very directional"
"12888420","12895240"," they're only built one-to-one calls are built to go along the market you first you had stocks in"
"12895240","12899340"," the market then you had calls you know there weren't even puts you couldn't even buy puts years ago"
"12899340","12908580"," old man stuff not this way before my time then they built puts as a hedge for your long positions"
"12908580","12917880"," now they're never constructed to make tons of money now futures I used to trade futures"
"12917880","12924600"," for like I had like a couple years I traded futures contracts but I don't like being up all night"
"12924600","12929480"," long and I don't like to get not the gambling but like the access to at 24 hours not 24"
"12929480","12939160"," hours but two portions of the day like nighttime daytime then I'd be up all stupid fucking hours so"
"12939160","12948540"," now I still have a futures an account I'll hedge longs or shorts in futures market if I'm holding a"
"12948540","12955720"," position overnight I just use it as a tool now now that doesn't mean you can't make money off puts"
"12955720","12960800"," I like I like puts in form of spreads I used to trade the wheel I used to trade flies"
"12960800","12965040"," all that kind of stuff you said complicate my trades and I used to try to make just right now"
"12965040","12973140"," for me I like to buy big dips in the market and sell big tops in the market with some"
"12973140","12977480"," time on it and then right now I've been reduced to basically trading zero dates and one dates"
"12977480","12985640"," directional moves scalping and it's paid out very well make way more money way less time way less"
"12985640","12991140"," like worrying about my positions we've talked in the past about how algorithms have come into"

"14027740","14035920"," past but um you can manage your spreads you can create a spread over time just buy it by calls"

"14057660","14063680"," um and there are times where and i'm not gonna this is my point behind it the reason i'm saying"
"14063680","14069440"," this to you is this is because there have been times when a spread's gone your way not a spread"
"14069440","14076080"," if let's say an oversold conditions you buy it you'll see repricing throughout the life of that uh"
"14076080","14085800"," that call and there's a there's a there's been time so when i when i've checked that we have back"
"14085800","14091900"," tested this there are times when we continue to roll lower so if you're in this super oversold"
"14091900","14097820"," condition and let's say you buy your let's say like fuck a cab just gonna buy calls and hold them"

"14145260","14149900"," uh for like large size moves that i'm looking for to make like a hundred percent or two hundred"
"14149900","14154720"," percent or three hundred percent with big money i'm in and i'm out i'm done i make them money and"

"14161780","14169180"," explaining this well enough it's better for me to explain it with a back test on previous examples"

"14194620","14198580"," ton of time on them i've got to where i bought it at where the price i'm trying to sell"
"14198580","14207600"," it at um it takes some of the uh some of the work out of what you're doing"

"14228280","14238940"," trade as close to perfect as possible without having to get too crazy with managing it and probably"
"14238940","14247680"," the biggest part of managing that trade is um is uh though though having less management of it is"
"14247680","14256030"," the scariest part of that trade it's very it can be a very um stressful trade it's not for"
"14256030","14265970"," everybody but the win rate on it is very high you could see"

"14535000","14539880"," consistent i'm talking like nine good trades like nine"
"14539880","14552080"," you should minimum seven to nine that's a high rate and"

"14648710","14655770"," make it every single time but you it has to be you back test that shit like eight nine ten"
"14655770","14664930"," times then do it again previous five years previous five years go back ten years 15 years 20 years"
"14666110","14672530"," you can see where the problems are so if you do fuck it up once or twice out of like"
"14672530","14677290"," ten trades if you timed it wrong once or twice that time trades then you can go back and just"
"14677290","14685250"," tinker on when you're timing now you're just working on timing at that point right you do you"
"14685250","14694110"," master that shit over five or ten years town is game changer game changer it"

"14746930","14759730"," a big why baby bb why yeah we'll do"
"14759730","14762950"," a video on that again i've done them in the past i gotta i gotta record one of those videos"
"14762950","14771010"," and just like post it so it's always there so it's like a direct someone to it it's pretty simple"
"14771010","14775730"," man it's not fucking hard this isn't rocket science what it is is that you've got you know you got"
"14775730","14781270"," people out there and no offense no no no hate towards them none of that stuff but people have to"
"14781270","14785390"," create a product for you to buy and a system for you to buy and they it's constantly having to"
"14785390","14790750"," improve upon shit and they get this new idea or this always works but there are simple fucking ways"
"14790750","14796570"," and no you can't you can't sell that it doesn't make good conversation it gets kind of boring right"
"14797210","14802610"," to say just buy super oversold conditions even when the market's going down you can buy them"
"14802610","14807030"," doesn't it doesn't matter so the funny part about that trade is it doesn't matter if the fucking"
"14807030","14811810"," market is trending down over years or up over years or sideways over years it doesn't make a"
"14811810","14820510"," difference fucking doesn't make a difference when we reach oversold conditions that there's these"
"14820510","14826570"," fucking machines buy it and that i think that was was that night it was a flash crash in 85"
"14826570","14833030"," or whatever we had no might have not been the flash crash it might have been just 87 crash there"
"14833030","14841670"," was supposedly this is like the beginning of computers they had the code wrong i'm kind of like"
"14843030","14849070"," kind of like shading this in right now there's probably better facts out there but now this"
"14849070","14854550"," computerized buying that kicks in at some points there's always some kind of a market because"
"14854550","14873790"," they've they've not had a market at certain points in our computer trading specifically it's"
"14875930","14882590"," right there this fucking killing me here i'm gonna kick out the robinhood traders so we can make a"
"14882590","14894310"," move 230 yeah"
"14894310","14901490"," there's a we'll make a video i've done videos in the past where i've actually marked every single"
"14901490","14911290"," instance of oversold conditions and shown where like a month call spread would"
"14911290","14920170"," print in where you would have needed a three month there's where they fail is typically where you"
"14920170","14925550"," think there's actually going to be or there's actual true risk of a market crash if you don't put"
"14925550","14931970"," enough time on those call spreads like i think it's three months you would have a win rate of like"
"14931970","14941290"," it's it's a win rate of you roughly lose three out of a hundred something like that the crazy part"
"14941290","14945850"," though too is if you're in the middle of that trade that one that you lose it's not three out"
"14945850","14949210"," of a hundred i think you lose like i want to say it's three out of forty or thirty trades"
"14949210","14957130"," or something like that maybe it's like some i forget what it is now but um and this is only"
"14957130","14966490"," on the long side the the fucking put spreads man even in a bear market the fucking put spreads"
"14966490","14977230"," can still be a problem the most consistent is the long side of that spread i've"
"14977230","14980190"," been y'all i've had people yell at me and be like well cap you missed all this money we"
"14980190","14984530"," could have made and i should have just bought zero dates or not zero dates i should have just"
"14984530","14990470"," bought OTM calls like a month out that all makes sense but i've tried to i've tried to back test"
"14990470","14997130"," that trade and there's been failure points uh high enough failure points that you might win like"
"14997130","15002090"," eight nine out of ten in the year and then one year you might have like two or three fucking"
"15002090","15007330"," huge failures and this is like size size on your account like you can't blow your count up like"
"15007330","15016210"," that i've done that too i've blown up accounts man it's fucking sucks i dismantled the desk once"
"15016210","15021930"," doing that i told my wife and kids to leave i was like tell my other kids and leave and"
"15021930","15029310"," then i fucking took like a thousand dollar desk and broke it down into little pieces i'm serious"
"15029310","15037150"," like that was stupidest fucking things ever done you'll learn i promise you if you haven't learned"
"15039270","15048850"," you will you will i promise you will torch down a fucking a a big account eventually anywhere"
"15048850","15056650"," like one to three to five times where you'll go back to work well you'll learn your lesson there's"
"15056650","15062510"," only there's only a few um there's a few things that i'll do it to you if you're like y "
"15062510","15066570","'all do that i'll learn down the road i'll learn down the road eventually eventually eventually"
"15066570","15070010"," you'll do is you lose enough money and you'll stop trading for like three to six months and you're"
"15070010","15078270"," gonna stay away from trade and then you're gonna start back testing finally trading methods and all"
"15078270","15086310"," your fucking mistakes and try to find something consistent and say no matter what i'm fucking"
"15086310","15102570"," trading this you eventually learn it's"
"15102570","15108510"," tough to grow a one thousand dollar account there are ways to grow but uh i feel like a thousand"
"15108510","15115430"," dollars twenty thousand dollars it can be it can be a real challenge um to grow a small account"
"15115430","15124430"," there are ways to grow small accounts that's one of the ways to grow a small account everybody gets"
"15124430","15129450"," greedy start account gets bigger accounts gets bigger and you're like i'm going in with size on"
"15129450","15138670"," some risky shit yeah and you guys know"
"15138670","15145830"," if any of you guys have a sizable counterpart in the market long enough you know about all the you"
"15145830","15150690"," know about having to learn how to trade size how to feel comfortable as you increase size then you"
"15150690","15159050"," go from size to not size anymore i used to think that fucking dealers knew that i was coming to"
"15159050","15163730"," the market i'd be in there trying to buy like fucking fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand"
"15163730","15170050"," dollars a weeklies and shit fucking fucking spy would go straight down and i'm like was it just me"
"15170050","15177230"," or was it another bunch of guys at the same time all buying this shit then i tried to hide"
"15177230","15182210"," my trades now i'm just too small mostly it's like mostly small trades outside of spreads it's like"
"15183950","15190330"," in big in big turnover moments i'll put spreads on so i don't stick out big volume moments so i"
"15190330","15196890"," just hide in amongst the pack but uh you'll know you'll learn all this shit the longer you trade"
"15196890","15206590"," and uh it takes time in market it's all time in market shit it's like this love-hate"
"15206590","15216030"," relationship all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna probably scat uh scat out here it's one three in the"
"15216030","15219770"," afternoon i get ready for this game i'm gonna grab a bear or a set bear or something so here's"
"15219770","15227670"," a deal um you guys want to take on tomorrow i'll give you a take when we close um book"
"15227670","15236550"," map for just a moment do you guys what i think is going to happen um let's just look at"
"15236550","15241890"," uh it's like a one month chart here okay i don't slop it right now i need to clean this"
"15241890","15252830"," up let's just go with some knowns okay what's the matter if you're a bull or a bear we"
"15252830","15256390"," know we've got volatility the next two days okay i want you to see that we've got some volatility"
"15256390","15265750"," we have one more chance of volatility down into friday or even you could look at it if we've got"
"15265750","15273650"," some bad news tomorrow would be a pump a market pump so if we're able to recover this today into"
"15273650","15286110"," tonight at least let's just pretend this is some kind of resistance here um you"
"15286110","15290590"," know just up in here this pivot point that's right here let's already cover this today and tomorrow"
"15290590","15296730"," and we get some vol into the event of course now we got news in the morning too so we"
"15296730","15301070"," could sell this off at eight thirty in the morning but that's what we're looking for i would i"
"15301070","15306690"," would expect to pump it i want to expect to pump into the close today well i'm gonna be honest"
"15306690","15313250"," with you i expect to pump into the close okay i'm gonna expect some kind of pumping the close the"
"15313250","15317010"," reason being is because the volatility of the news before the open tomorrow and then the vol that"
"15317010","15322750"," comes in later in the day either whether we trade it down or into j-pow tomorrow i think you"
"15322750","15328990"," get the pumping the close today i do but we have some volatility tomorrow we also have volatility"
"15328990","15333750"," on fucking thursday and then it's gonna probably bloodbath it's a high probability of a bloodbath"
"15333750","15339290"," that bloodbath thing is down as a bull what you should be looking for uh you want to buy a"
"15339290","15343910"," dip man you want to buy something fucking down here i'll be honest with you you want to buy that"
"15343910","15348330"," this is like what you want to buy you want to buy something like that you want to buy it"
"15348330","15353730"," down here you want to buy it down here you want to buy it with some safety now bears are"
"15353730","15358650"," bears are hoping for that volatility now there's a there's a thought process here that why do we"
"15358650","15363430"," have calls that are so expensive is that the news is going to be great tomorrow uh there's a lot"
"15363430","15367910"," of reporters out there saying nope we're just trading down here we're going to get this super blast"
"15367910","15372250"," up uh tomorrow so if you want to put some money on you want to put like ten percent of"
"15372250","15379050"," your money on on this move you could you could put some call spreads that have time on them so"
"15379050","15386950"," we come back up later and hit up uh personally i want to be buying uh this book map supply"
"15386950","15393210"," bull trap up here you want to be buying fucking put spreads on highs right so even let's say you"
"15393210","15398470"," miss this move and you let's say like i didn't trade this and you miss this you want to be"
"15398470","15407070"," buying fucking bear shit on highs and fucking bullshit on lows right remember that so we're up on"
"15407070","15412670"," highs up here you buy fuck you buy with confidence right we start trading down in here you want to"
"15412670","15418250"," buy with confidence where is it at it's down here we already broke this trend i've already broken"
"15418250","15427030"," that trend so the the look is down that is where the look is uh you know you might not"
"15427030","15432250"," get every trade you might not take every trade so but you want a high confidence in those trades"
"15432250","15436810"," right the more we stretch down here the more there's a there's a chance of us going up the more"
"15436810","15441330"," we squeeze up higher the more there was a chance we come down always consider that when you're"
"15441330","15446950"," taking the trades that you're that you're looking for extremes in the market what someone could"
"15446950","15450810"," call this an extreme down here like we're already starting to hit extreme i'll agree with that but"
"15450810","15459210"," this is more extreme right so uh so start to think about this stuff when you're taking trades uh"
"15459210","15465490"," where the risk is i think the risk today into the close specifically into the close for volatility"
"15465490","15470910"," is for us to trade this up at least into the bell maybe maybe into like two three forty five"
"15470910","15477070"," or so um and then we can start getting some uh some imbalanced shit for the south side down"
"15477070","15483710"," anticipation of tomorrow but there should be a move higher um should be the probability of it"
"15483710","15491500"," trading higher into this bell um so yeah that's my thought process if you want to think what i want"
"15491500","15495680"," to know what i think i think we get vol into the next three days i don't think it's practical"
"15495680","15499440"," i think we get vol in the next few days i think uh vix is setting up for the vol"
"15499440","15502900"," into the next couple days i mean you look at the you look at vix it's setting up for it"
"15502900","15508400"," right you've got all these indicators telling you uh they were setting up for some volatility you"
"15508400","15512680"," know in a mix of good and bad news you even got the uh vix here i mean look at"
"15512680","15523550"," the vix how can vix is telling you right that we're at a low and to expect some volatility that's"
"15523550","15530410"," what it's telling you it's it's it's it's it's reading that this is coming so yeah we can go up"
"15530410","15537790"," but i'd rather be fucking up here right now if we were up here i'd rather say to yeah you"
"15537790","15544410"," know what the chances are i'm going to 45 rare the better chances that we go down here right so"
"15544410","15550110"," when you start talking about probabilities and probably where we're going probably going up in"
"15550110","15559210"," volatility the next three days uh so though there's probably a pump in the bell today it's probably"
"15559210","15562430"," going to be a pump in the bell today you won't go straight up and straight down i'm going to"
"15562430","15569070"," expect some kind of for today uh some kind of uh some kind of a squeeze higher even if it's"
"15569070","15575010"," just to hear me maybe get the 396 and then we come back down to this level again could be"
"15575010","15579770"," something like that something like this move higher and then close it out down here could be"
"15579770","15586230"," slightly higher this pivot point bears want to be holding this no matter what into wednesday"
"15586230","15593510"," thursday friday i want to hold all this area here and then you know it's always better some of this"
"15593510","15599190"," is better to wait to react so if you're feel like shit which way do i pick for wednesday thursday"
"15599190","15603770"," friday some is better to see what the initial reaction is trade take the other side or take trade"

"20134740","20140940"," pay attention to this as as it trades the one fair that you would have in this trade would be"
"20140940","20146920"," as we come into the bell uh you let's say we hit that three o'clock hour right you get"
"20146920","20153040"," this you get this big buy right here and the one the one fair would be come in right uh"
"20153040","20158660"," you get your one two three or you want to pretty move higher and then at three p.m. they'd"
"20158660","20162740"," start selling the market down on you this would be like the rug pull trade so there's a there's a"
"20162740","20166560"," bad trade to this so what i would say to you is this is that uh you're going to look"
"20166560","20171520"," to enter this trade uh the safe way to enter this trade would be to look for one one to"
"20171520","20177680"," two to three taps uh so i'd be looking for somewhere around in here some i'd be looking for the"
"20177680","20183040"," second tap somewhere my cursor is we're looking for the second one down here and then maybe a quick"
"20183040","20189800"," liquidity grab down below something like that and then you grab that trade higher right there um"
"20189800","20194880"," that's what i'd be looking for now it might just often run without you because of this big green"
"20194880","20200740"," bar this big volume grab right here um and it can be a fake out so when you're looking for"
"20200740","20205180"," this so if i was looking for this i'd be so i'm gonna do i'm gonna show exactly what i'm"
"20205180","20208960"," looking for this might go this might just blast straight out but this is a trade where you can't"
"20208960","20217160"," miss it it's it's that it's that powerful now i'd be looking to move this over here and i'd be"
"20217160","20222220"," waiting down somewhere down in here you can see it down here too right it's already come down one"
"20222220","20227260"," actually this could be a little larger time frame one two three you got one two and this might be"
"20227260","20233180"," your power move right here uh hold on me let me mute this mute book map real quick this could"
"20233180","20237500"," actually be your power move there's your one there's a two years three that could be a monster move"
"20237500","20246580"," higher now i'd be looking for somewhere down in here i'd be looking for a quick roll"
"20246580","20253500"," and then boom it's powerful fucking move up into the close just keep your eyes open in this trade"
"20253500","20263100"," right here and of course on these big trades like this big power move there's always like the rug"
"20263100","20268780"," pull there's like a guy back here there's like the guy from the bedroom hedge fund and he's just"
"20268780","20274580"," looking to just yank out the buyers right here and trap you going down so you have to have some"
"20274580","20279880"," stops somewhere in here like you're looking to buy this and you don't want it to go below that"
"20281640","20287000"," would make it the safest would be to buy right here and not have stops below over here but it"
"20287000","20291260"," might just take off that was a pretty big move right here so i can't say that it's not just"
"20291260","20296020"," gonna take off and start running but if you want the safety of the trade it's somewhere down below"
"20296020","20304960"," i'm going to fucking power move to the top but i'm impressed that it stayed i'm impressed that it"
"20304960","20312700"," stayed in here while i've been gone it's pretty much a blueprint for what to uh take spec so"
"20312700","20322250"," somewhere down in here on this s1 see if you can catch this on a down move for a trade"
"20322250","20332230"," higher does that help yeah you might just see the power"
"20332230","20339130"," move up it might just blast off it's pretty powerful move you're gonna it's pretty pretty part no"
"20339130","20347520"," one's buying here to not see it print something and the key is can you get in lower there's"
"20347520","20352100"," probably some people with money that want to take it the one i'm jumping on the trade usually it's"
"20352100","20359920"," not always one time you know you want to see like you want to see where people get in you"
"20359920","20365920"," want to like keep time of in the market you want to keep time of um you know someone bought"
"20365920","20372040"," down here someone bought down here they took some profit and they're trying for a second move down"
"20372040","20379760"," here to get some more profit so i mean yeah okay you guys you guys get it you guys don't"
"20379760","20387870"," need me good luck in this trade higher we'll see if it moves into the bell it's it's a power"
"20387870","20397840"," move without a doubt captain of the crayon baby yeah"
"20397840","20403960"," this is a buy down here this is a fucking buy there's no low volume fucking sell or anything this"
"20403960","20412730"," big giant green bar is a green bar is a fucking going up so use volume charts it's gonna it"
"20412730","20418230"," should blast off if not if not right here somewhere down here someone's gonna grab some liquidity"
"20418230","20422350"," and rip it higher you know you got a big player you got like a hedge fund or something that"
"20422350","20426490"," bought this and they want to make sure that it's going up higher they'll jump right back in and buy"
"20426490","20436380"," more they have they have deeper pockets all you're"
"20436380","20439680"," trying to do is grab one of these down here if it happens you want to be able to grab"
"20439680","20445820"," one of these down here because as a matter of fact this cross right here you want it to be"
"20445820","20457990"," like you might want it to be like something like this that's not like golden cross area i know"
"20457990","20467450"," golden crosses are um moving averages but i use these crosses all the time and they they tend to"
"20467450","20477450"," maybe they call it a captain jim james cross you"
"20477450","20483130"," take the crumbs with that one yeah this is a pretty easy trade right here you're seeing that when"
"20483130","20486350"," you ever see something like this not always but you can see it right here you can see it right"
"20486350","20490830"," here you can see it right here you can you can just see it on a volume bars you can't"
"20490830","20500080"," see it with the book map up but you can see this this volume right big volume spike in green"
"20500080","20506840"," bars then a decline in volume and you get to move higher right to a big volume bar right decline"
"20506840","20512240"," in volume and you're looking for that last move up so there's like two moves you get the big volume"
"20512240","20516620"," bar and then you get a decline in volume and then the move actually happens today people say things"
"20516620","20525160"," like um big volumes are going up it's actually the declining volume on a green volume bar where the"
"20525160","20533820"," where the move actually happens so like finer details of oh and these moves happen"
"20533820","20543790"," yeah i mean you can you can take the trade you can you can trade whatever you"
"20543790","20549770"," like you know how to set up sets itself up as though as you're looking for the safest trade so"
"20549770","20556910"," the safest trade is down here or even down here and at least one two three so you'll see like"
"20556910","20563710"," a one two move higher one two three move higher if you get a one two one two three and"
"20563710","20567830"," it doesn't move higher if you start seeing it stall right here that's where you'll see your failure"
"20568910","20576110"," so if you start seeing a stall on a second or third uh consolidation that's when you know you're"
"20576110","20584910"," turning into distribution now you'll start to see that that moves stall not every time but enough"
"20584910","20590170"," the enough that you can pinpoint when we're stalling or we're gonna blast we're gonna roll over"
"20590170","20598270"," like remember so remember up here well um we guys remember earlier today when we were up here we"
"20598270","20603530"," made this move and i was like man i don't fucking like this we're stalling out in this move and"
"20603530","20607810"," we ended up rolling over so you don't want to want to see that like push and then stall and"
"20607810","20612510"," even this right here was enough even this right here was enough to show you that we were stalling"
"20612510","20619390"," right we're just stalling so it's the first consolidation bar there was there was no two"
"20619390","20627290"," consolidations one consolidation and deep declining declining but we've got time against us um so"
"20627290","20632710"," you want you want to see like you want to see boom bought it move up higher boom maybe that"
"20632710","20638110"," then where i am ramming home and so you're looking at target if you can target sometimes the only"
"20638110","20647470"," two moves then then you get the rip that was a pretty powerful buy down there so someone is likely"
"20650030","20659890"," someone is likely um forcing this to print all"
"20659890","20664270"," right i'm gonna go back to the game hopefully you guys are watching it's a pretty kick-ass game u "
"20664270","20669470",".s didn't show up last match man this match they they decided to play a foot stall against people"
"20669470","20673950"," they must have figured out that aran didn't have the best players that aran was trying to play"
"20673950","20679530"," world cup soccer u.s just reverted back to like old school foot stall which is kind of rad playing"
"20679530","20687230"," like small court boom ball not boom ball like a man a man three on three crazy crazy like fast"
"20687230","20694190"," fast paced young man soccer young blood soccer it's like college basketball it's nice to see"
"20694190","20701290"," because they don't have a hitter but a strap a big striker but that's okay they're uh they're"
"20701290","20712750"," definitely looking good today oh man tasco the new low of the day that's"
"20712750","20719770"," right yeah yeah i see the possible future i try to i try to when i trade most of my"
"20719770","20727050"," trades are trading habits revolve around probabilities what what what's the what's the probability"
"20727050","20731370"," of this happening so it seems like i've magic ball but i don't it's just a matter of looking at"
"20731370","20735310"," the entire map and saying what's the probability of this happening so sometimes it goes against me"
"20735310","20743410"," but i you know you want to take high probability trades high probability um paths for the for the"
"20743410","20752910"," um you know we did this yesterday we did this we did this no way down right we tried to"
"20752910","20760340"," buy dips yesterday but at the same time we were aware that you know we were aware i i deleted"
"20760340","20764820"," it today but do you remember when yesterday when we we started drawing this out earlier in the day"
"20764820","20771200"," and we drew this whole entire thing out right to the bottom remember i i i put a 394 down"
"20771200","20777060"," here and we had that we we tracked this all day long yesterday right this large trend and you"
"20777060","20781760"," should be doing that you should be like hey where are we going where are we headed when do we"
"20781760","20787660"," get pulls breaking out of this um and so same same kind of a deal today no no difference it's"
"20787660","20792840"," on a track to see where we're going watching for that reversal we got that reversal earlier you can"
"20792840","20799140"," see the reversal in here right coming down coming down now we're getting a reversal right there's a"
"20799140","20803760"," trend reversal right here you can see the trend reversal we wanted that trend reversal yesterday we"
"20803760","20814750"," didn't get it uh so we're getting it today and you're going to see that get picked back up we're"
"20814750","20818610"," seeing that play out right now dips are being bought we're trying to push it up dips are being"
"20818610","20828650"," bothered we're trying to reverse trying to head higher into the close right here uh"
"20828650","20834290"," what's the probability i think i think the likelihood i think i said this earlier today likelihood"
"20834290","20839730"," was that we trade up and then we we sell it down into the bell um something like that that's"
"20839730","20845490"," what i would expect uh can we sneak it up that now yesterday we didn't sneak it down but we"
"20845490","20850950"," do always have that probability of possibility uh that you move make this move higher or you come"
"20850950","20856650"," back down for some support and then towards the bell if we start if we do if we go early"
"20856650","20863070"," low sometimes you'll see that little sneak up right into the bell uh so you'll see some of that"
"20863070","20875310"," sometimes as well uh low"
"20875310","20885300"," probability of getting above here uh so the high the high probability is 396.91 though that's a"
"20885300","20895100"," low probability high for the close low probability high of the close is 396.90 likelihood if"
"20895100","20904960"," you want likelihood right there 396 uh but that still includes more than likely a sell-off at"
"20904960","20912440"," some point if we hit it we really want to buy is really want to buy this really want to"
"20912440","20919960"," see this like something like that that's the fucking move right there but i doubt we get it that"
"20919960","20927080"," was a giant green bar back here you'd have to have an imbalanced sell side after three o'clock"
"20927080","20934720"," there actually it is 310 so if you start listening into uh financial juice to come out and tell you"
"20934720","20939180"," if we're in a sell side or buy side imbalance see the sell side imbalance watch out for the move"
"20939180","20944520"," down lower catch you guys all tomorrow uh we're gonna go back to watching the game good luck for"
"20944520","20950260"," the rest today nice trade right here beautiful trade uh looking for one more trade into this bell"

"21029130","21035470"," i was here i wanted like 415 i think and for an extension and then here i wanted it at"
"21035470","21042810"," 406 and i didn't get it so i think i might have one more chance i'm hoping that i don't"
