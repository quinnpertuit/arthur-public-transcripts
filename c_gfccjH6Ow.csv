"8150","9390"," Check one two Mike."
"33330","34210"," Check one. "
"58840","60680"," Good morning, everybody."
"60860","61620"," How y'all doing out there?"
"70510","73550"," Yeah, everybody's piled in right now."
"73570","74510"," We're not good to see everybody. "
"75470","76970"," How y'all doing out there?"
"77850","78890"," Happy morning to you all."
"79150","79410"," Happy Thursday."
"81410","82690"," All right, let's get right in. "
"82850","84510"," Whoa, we've got about something new over here."
"85510","86590"," Before I'd let this continue."
"86730","87550"," Part of it does go back. "
"87550","88110"," Let's not forget."
"88410","91070"," There was a different CEO for a number of years."
"91450","92490"," Good to do. "
"92590","96030"," You just want to be in the matchable board and you want to keep it and you want to you"
"96030","99170"," may want to criticize the board and that down a little bit in the background there."
"99390","100770"," Success in succession."
"100990","103050"," Good morning to all of you. "
"103850","108170"," So we had a stabilizing market yesterday, right?"
"109350","114870"," And we had one last little dip down to 470 and then we rolled right back up into close and"
"114870","116630"," we are up this morning."
"121310","125090"," And hopefully I think I've posted to you."
"126510","128669"," We should get a print right here, right?"
"129389","133630"," We're in the money 100% on that trade right now, right?"
"134530","136890"," So you take that trade off here. "
"137390","140630"," You don't know."
"143230","143950"," Hold on here."
"146010","150050"," You take the trade off here because we can't make any more money. "
"150470","153590"," I guess we get cut one side of it off, but you should be taking the money and running."
"159470","160110"," Hold on."
"160190","161710"," We got a couple of things we got to do here. "
"161790","162890"," I got to do a couple of quick things."
"163290","167990"," Hold on one second here."
"168150","169790"," I got one more thing to do here in my end. "
"169790","172150"," They got to make sure I'm good, but what I'm supposed to be doing here."
"176770","177910"," There we go."
"181170","182750"," And this is what else we got here. "
"184610","186010"," Turn the comments."
"186350","192310"," So it's our most recent first state and the stock has just been nothing but a horse."
"192310","193690"," I'm going to miss them here. "
"193830","194390"," Something here."
"194510","194990"," I'm missing them."
"195310","198790"," I got it all. "
"199130","201490"," I'm missing my thumbnail for a second."
"202690","204090"," newest comments first."
"204630","206190"," What's going on?"
"206350","207210"," Good morning, my brother. "
"210830","213070"," We have some issues this morning."
"213270","214310"," We're going to talk about them."
"215530","216770"," Not quite issues. "
"217230","220390"," We're above the gamma flip at the moment, which is good."
"221790","223490"," We turned this down for a minute here."
"223710","230030"," I want to show you guys a couple of quick things here. "
"230170","233490"," Now these levels, I was pushing the levels where I want them."
"234010","236890"," I had to make a try."
"237070","238510"," I had to close my trade. "
"239970","249390"," I'm running a little bit behind at the moment, but regardless of where the levels are, I do want"
"249390","253690"," you to look specifically at price action."
"255730","258430"," And we're in a crossing environment here, right?"
"258829","260510"," So, or price."
"260810","263310"," I should say V shape recovery. "
"265030","266490"," The bounce right."
"266650","267410"," We're now up here."
"268470","272970"," And price has crossed above the hourly trigger. "
"273590","277030"," The half hour trigger needs to cross higher."
"278070","284030"," And also when you see that half hour crossing the hourly, we typically will come back down and do a"
"284030","287210"," back check on trend to the upside."
"287210","287770"," Okay. "
"289830","291910"," And you want that confirmation."
"292830","295910"," That doesn't matter where we squeeze to or how high we go."
"296390","299170"," You're always looking for that back check at some point. "
"299170","306290"," And I always say this to bulls and bears, both of you guys, generally speaking, I don't care if"
"306290","310810"," we're going down or if we're going up the initial move though, right?"
"311150","317230"," So the initial move above the hourly trend or the initial move below the hourly trend."
"317770","319330"," You want that back check."
"320190","320350"," Okay. "
"321130","325670"," And that back check signifies, especially on an hourly basis."
"328530","331530"," Now you can do this on a daily basis, weekly basis."
"332470","334170"," One in five minute basis, right?"
"334350","339850"," You know, Jerry Marcus is out there and he trades that one in five minute trend, right?"
"341810","345730"," So on this hourly trend, at least you're looking for that back check. "
"347250","350810"," And you need it for a continuation mostly, right?"
"351030","353150"," So it's not like your squeeze isn't great and all that kind of stuff."
"353150","355550"," But you are looking for some kind of a back check."
"355830","362270"," And oftentimes you'll see them when you see two triggers crossing. "
"362810","366150"," It ends up acting like a magnet for that back check."
"366390","369370"," So we'll see if we get that back check or not."
"369590","372910"," Or if we just park it and you see the cross come up here. "
"373070","374750"," You see this gray cross here."
"375850","377650"," We just start running at some point."
"377910","377930"," Okay. "
"378490","380710"," But I like to see that back check."
"380710","383110"," Now coincidentally, same time."
"386010","386550"," Excuse me. "
"390520","391960"," Now at the same time, right?"
"393460","396180"," Now, I need to do all this again, but whatever."
"396420","397180"," I'll do this in a minute."
"397360","400800"," But the key point here is that here's your gamma flip right here. "
"402980","406880"," And it just so happens to lie right where we are on SPX."
"408400","409720"," So we do want that."
"409840","413620"," I want to see that, you know, that just that back check on gamma flip and where do we head"
"413620","415420"," next will be the next question, right?"
"415560","416220"," Where are we going, cap?"
"417100","419520"," Where are we going into Friday and stuff like that too, right?"
"420200","422220"," So we got a target for the upside here. "
"422620","424940"," 47, 75, 14."
"426880","433000"," So 47, 75, 14, 93 on SPX at least."
"433540","435500"," And that's just that top of the key right here. "
"435600","437720"," We talked about that top of the key yesterday, right?"
"438580","440880"," Remember, I drew these in for you yesterday."
"440880","447640"," So on the main screen back here, we're just looking for we use our normal tools that we use, right?"
"447820","449880"," Guys, we use how many times we go over this stuff."
"450240","452220"," Every day we're in here talking about the stuff, right?"
"452320","457020"," It's like, it's like, here's a new tools, here's a new tool, that kind of stuff, right?"
"457560","459360"," We talked about this one back here yesterday. "
"460920","462780"," And lo and behold, where are we at?"
"463420","465620"," We talked about this one yesterday, right?"
"466040","468180"," Lo and behold, here we are, here we're at."
"468580","469020"," Tap it up here."
"469780","470320"," Nice little sweep. "
"471480","474780"," So we're going to get rid of these at this moment or move these up now, okay?"
"475800","478600"," And we know where support lies, right?"
"478700","481180"," So we know that support is right here on this green area right here."
"481800","482420"," This is support."
"483000","483560"," Hold on. "
"484680","486520"," This is support right here and this is trend."
"487240","492220"," Okay, if we're going to continue up and then we took out our previous pivot points."
"492820","494600"," So we're going to start to look at the next pivot points, right?"
"496280","497840"," We'll drop this one up here. "
"499580","500580"," We're right about there."
"501420","502540"," Drop this one right here."
"503560","504580"," And we'll add another one in. "
"504820","505300"," How about this?"
"505400","506800"," We'll take this one from the other day."
"508100","509060"," Put this one."
"509960","511000"," Ready to tag that one. "
"513240","514520"," One more up there."
"516799","518059"," Just put those up there."
"519280","520240"," Really simple, right?"
"520559","520980"," Not too hard. "
"526220","531280"," And so if you're looking for some targets for upside targets, you got them, right?"
"531500","531960"," You got support."
"532240","532720"," You got targets."
"533640","539280"," You know that if we roll down below, that will be below positive gamma again and then we'll start"
"539280","542240"," flipping to the bare side for a downside move. "
"542340","548140"," You got one more target right here for a back check, I guess, if you really wanted to say we're"
"548140","549100"," still bullish, I guess."
"549980","554300"," Could come all the way down to this pivot and come back up, but we don't want to go down"
"554300","554680"," to the downside."
"556060","561180"," And I don't expect that role into, personally, I don't expect that role until we get into the"
"561180","561440"," weekend. "
"561480","565020"," So I'm not looking for extreme bearishness or anything like that."
"565140","568840"," But I am looking for sideways and down into next week."
"568840","571100"," We'll talk about that at some point this morning. "
"571720","576180"," It doesn't necessarily have to happen, but I would like to see."
"576400","577760"," I mean, I'll be honest with you guys."
"578280","583040"," If we're going to make, or if we are going to make a run this year, if the thesis is,"
"583620","585240"," we're going to get a seasonal low. "
"586240","590780"," My expectation is that earnings come in, if they've been trading up, right?"
"590960","591600"," They get a great earnings."
"591960","592740"," They're going to sell the news."
"593140","595000"," They take the monetize, right?"
"596460","602440"," You're going to be looking for other companies to get a major low on their earnings, believe it or"
"602440","602660"," not. "
"602940","606300"," And some blood into this spring."
"607560","612820"," Who wants to buy a ticker on a high, right?"
"612820","616320"," To buy for a bull run for the rest of this year."
"616520","621900"," So my expectations for earnings this season are either take the money and stuff that's been run up"
"621900","628800"," or some capitulation to the downside for tickers out there that really isn't as bad as you might"
"628800","629060"," think. "
"629140","631840"," It's more just a setup for the rest of the year."
"632080","635200"," So keep that in mind at this point where we are."
"639820","641660"," We'll chat more about that this morning. "
"641660","650820"," We'll talk more about that this morning, but I would keep your, I guess, my thesis here on earnings"
"650820","658420"," season for this year specifically is to, if you've got five, ten, fifty, hundred, whatever your"
"658420","664480"," favorite tickers are and they've been underperforming, it's not necessarily a bad thing."
"664920","669860"," They've been underperforming if you're of the thesis that we're going to have some form of a bull"
"669860","672360"," run into that election season at the end of the year."
"673180","676720"," You should always welcome weakness in tickers. "
"677560","678500"," If that's the case."
"679500","681200"," So we're getting into that more."
"681340","682380"," We have to go over earnings. "
"682840","686820"," I didn't go over the bank earnings and miss that or that."
"686900","687840"," I didn't have the time to do it."
"687900","691700"," We're going to look at the earnings for this year and a lot of your favorite tickers and stuff. "
"691860","695180"," I think we have the time today to get to some of those tickers."
"696700","699500"," Right now, just come back down and back check that hourly trigger."
"700560","704920"," We'll see if we can actually get the touch down there and find out are we bullish or not. "
"707920","711660"," Let me set up the levels for you this morning because none of these are accurate at this time."
"711860","713000"," The point I think is right."
"714240","717560"," 471.65. Put that down there. "
"718580","719320"," One quick second here."
"719900","720440"," Set these up."
"721400","723160"," 471.65. 471. "
"734480","735840"," There's your S1."
"736560","737440"," Support one."
"737540","748470"," Then we have 468.73. Here's"
"748470","750090"," your second support right here. "
"750490","757810"," And then down below we got 467.59. Right there."
"757870","758270"," Close enough."
"760670","764530"," And then above we've already blasted through our one. "
"765350","768670"," And that's sitting at 473."
"768670","769070"," 43."
"772550","783100"," We got"
"783100","783960"," our two right here. "
"784800","793080"," 474.57. That's your R2."
"794160","805720"," And then your R3 for today is 476.35. Up"
"805720","805940"," there."
"806140","806760"," Docker right. "
"807800","809640"," That looks appropriate to me as well."
"811480","813220"," Looks appropriate up here as well to me."
"813320","814720"," I don't think we're ever getting back to that 4800. "
"815900","816740"," Well not ever."
"817060","819820"," But I don't think we're getting back to that 4800 today or tomorrow."
"820440","821500"," Personally I don't. "
"821840","824920"," I think that we do."
"825300","826960"," And some of you all think that we are."
"827180","829620"," But for me I don't think that we are. "
"830940","834700"," Let's also take a quick look at the 30 minute chart here."
"835660","837720"," And just so you can get some context right."
"837840","840040"," Just just get some context here. "
"848100","850580"," It's a nice little context right here right."
"850940","851720"," So you can see this."
"853880","855640"," One, two, three. "
"855740","856520"," Nice blast up."
"856780","857040"," Whoop."
"857500","858300"," Daddy I love you. "
"858800","858840"," Right."
"859260","859760"," Come back down."
"860100","861020"," Slam into that daily trigger. "
"861880","862900"," Right back up here."
"863540","864260"," Talk to you about."
"864660","868240"," Talk to you about coming into this on Friday and being told no. "
"868240","870560"," We're right back down again."
"870660","870880"," Okay."
"870880","872040"," So just be aware of that. "
"872200","874580"," They're going to try to sell you here right now where we are today."
"874980","875780"," But I don't."
"875780","876460"," I don't know if it is. "
"876620","877580"," It's either today or tomorrow."
"877720","880160"," They should commit and try to sell this right back down again."
"881120","882260"," Matter of fact yesterday. "
"882780","886140"," When I talked to some of you guys and there's some lower targets down here."
"886460","888540"," But there's a giant move coming up here."
"888880","890960"," And I don't know where this is here. "
"891640","893020"," Where this dip is going to be to buy."
"893920","894880"," We'll talk about that as well."
"894880","898400"," Where we think it is and where we think we're going and we should have one more. "
"898580","899640"," One more squeeze."
"900740","906300"," I'm going to call it a squeeze because this squeeze should result in a big down move."
"907980","911660"," Into late March 21st, 20th of March, something like that. "
"912320","915400"," Pretty significant correction coming up."
"915740","916980"," In the springtime."
"917440","920580"," Should now it doesn't mean that it's guaranteed that's how it's going to go. "
"921420","926940"," But we're going to we're looking forward with a plan to that and we'll trade what's in front of us."
"927760","931140"," You know we do it day by day by price action of course but."
"932500","933440"," We are at least. "
"933940","935760"," Hey this is what we think is going to happen down the road."
"936160","936440"," It's wrong."
"937240","938380"," We'll adjust to it right. "
"938600","940060"," But we're always thinking ahead of it."
"940400","943280"," I saw someone yesterday on fin to it."
"943920","947100"," Bring up how shocked they are. "
"949380","955740"," And how many people don't have a plan how they enter trade how they exit a trade that goes against"
"955740","959320"," them how they exit to they double down is their thesis right the timing is wrong."
"960540","962720"," Your entire trade being planned out right."
"963160","968280"," We talk about that here frequently don't we spend a lot of time on matter of fact I think two"
"968280","971880"," days ago or three days ago we are three sessions ago that we were together. "
"972680","976640"," That I laid out trade we start to finish right."
"976980","982280"," I was like we're going to do this this this this this this and the moment that it fails we"
"982280","985460"," know to exit our trade right it's not going the way that we want it."
"985820","991340"," And if we take this trade what's our percentage of winning from the point that we take that trade. "
"992000","997100"," Like here's that we have a 30% chance or 15% chance 30% chance 60% chance 80"
"997100","998540"," plus chance to make money."
"999440","1005560"," At different places and why are that why are we at 15% why are we at 30 where where's"
"1005560","1007000"," the fail points in that trade."
"1010600","1014360"," So we're going to go over earnings today at some point. "
"1014920","1021440"," We're what waiting for a check a back check here on the hourly trigger to confirm if the move is"
"1021440","1023780"," higher into Friday now from my perspective."
"1023780","1027339"," My price target on Friday was 475."
"1028660","1034200"," I think that is top for this week at least personally I could be wrong there. "
"1035040","1039400"," We could bounce off this hourly trigger and trade for 80 or whatever but."
"1040520","1041440"," I'm on team."
"1043079","1049020"," I'm on team park the bus into the end of the week somewhere around that 40 47 50. "
"1051980","1057080"," 4750 and down to 4,700 and then a slow bleed out into the end of the month."
"1057760","1059300"," That doesn't mean we'll have some cool trades."
"1059600","1061160"," We'll have some cool trades in this earnings season. "
"1061320","1064500"," We have some fun this earnings season but that's what I'm expecting here at least."
"1067680","1069740"," All right let me just check these one more time here."
"1070700","1072320"," That looks right there for me. "
"1077040","1080020"," All right so I'm going to go over a few things with you we're going to I'm going to catch"
"1080020","1080940"," you up to the market."
"1080940","1084660"," And we're going to have a quick chat about the market for today."
"1085200","1087660"," I'm going to read some notes to you this morning. "
"1090100","1091400"," One quick second here."
"1094720","1097600"," Let me check gamma this morning too by the way."
"1099240","1103460"," I'm going to make sure that we're the same on gamma this morning make sure I'm not telling you one"
"1103460","1105360"," thing in the game pictures change. "
"1106140","1109540"," So I talked to you about the gamma that's rolling off into this Friday."
"1110240","1113480"," It's about half of the call gamma that's in the market."
"1113840","1118620"," There is another you know the the call game that's running off the market. "
"1118620","1122280"," The market is still developing call gamma though to the upside."
"1123240","1126880"," So we'll we'll wait and see how that works itself out."
"1129720","1131040"," Put that in there. "
"1131640","1132380"," Yes we're good."
"1132620","1134200"," Oh no the gamma flip is slightly lower."
"1136940","1141820"," It's 47.50 or 47.48 or something. "
"1146360","1150040"," 47.49 so just below 47.50 on SPX."
"1150680","1151560"," It's gone down slightly."
"1152440","1154020"," I'm going to leave this up for you right now. "
"1154120","1156160"," Look the bottom right hand side of your screen."
"1157880","1158900"," Look down here."
"1159640","1164140"," This is your gamma flip right there. "
"1165660","1170220"," We're just going to check and see the behavior on that flip see if it holds or not."
"1174460","1175420"," Let me bring that."
"1175680","1176740"," I thought I had gamma flip. "
"1176960","1177420"," Yeah here we go."
"1178240","1179400"," I'm going to move this over."
"1180920","1182960"," Here's the SPX gamma flip right here. "
"1192740","1195100"," We're going to see if that holds right there or not."
"1195100","1202600"," And also note two we have a gap on SPX down just above the five minute trigger."
"1203080","1209260"," So it is possible you could see like a quick break down below and then a recovery. "
"1209500","1212620"," So it might not bounce exactly off of right here because I'm just looking at this."
"1213140","1217400"," I'm looking at this gap that needs filled on SPX small gap down there."
"1225240","1226400"," Oh yeah, I sold right. "
"1226600","1228320"," I was I was 100% of the money."
"1228780","1230780"," So 475 was top for me."
"1230960","1232900"," So I was out right on the open this morning. "
"1233420","1234720"," And I didn't say something about it."
"1234820","1236700"," I think when the stream came up that I was closing them."
"1236840","1238620"," So I closed them or whatever. "
"1240380","1241160"," Good question."
"1246060","1247800"," Let me read some stuff to you."
"1248560","1253400"," Feds Raphael Bostick the voting member of course says he doesn't expect the fed to start cutting"
"1253400","1255460"," rates until the third quarter. "
"1256600","1259540"," Until the third quarter according according to Bloomberg."
"1260020","1260520"," So key three."
"1261320","1262520"," They want to start cutting. "
"1264120","1264800"," That's bizarre."
"1265920","1266760"," That's not bizarre."
"1267020","1267740"," You know what the truth is. "
"1268480","1269780"," We talk about it right."
"1270680","1272260"," We're not getting any fucking cuts."
"1272260","1276600"," And they're going to fraudulently report fraudulent numbers. "
"1276960","1280620"," It's the highest point of fraud and from the fed."
"1281600","1287580"," And they're going to massage the numbers and they're going to massage the inverted yield curve and"
"1287580","1288320"," get used to it."
"1289700","1292860"," If you want to know when they're going to likely cut if they were going"
"1292860","1302240"," to cut. "
"1302780","1305220"," Volatility into the election we should drop into September."
"1306420","1308520"," And they're talking about cutting at that point."
"1308940","1310540"," And then that ball is going to kick off. "
"1311180","1313220"," The market's going to moon."
"1313640","1314780"," It's going to straight fucking moon."
"1316420","1318520"," So I don't know if I see those cuts at that point. "
"1319800","1321700"," And it doesn't answer the question either."
"1321940","1322640"," Like here's another thing."
"1323120","1325540"," When you guys hear about when you guys hear about. "
"1327800","1330140"," Like Hey, what does bag holder mean?"
"1330420","1330500"," Right?"
"1330700","1335180"," There's a whole story behind like bag holder is not something that was just made up."
"1335260","1338480"," It has to do with the bag being empty being filled along the way."
"1338520","1341660"," And then people convincing each other that there's still room in the bag. "
"1342400","1343720"," You become the bag holder."
"1343980","1344480"," It's not empty."
"1344800","1345620"," It's actually full. "
"1346720","1346900"," Right?"
"1347160","1351700"," You guys understand that concept that when you hear about a bag holder, the bag is not empty."
"1351780","1354780"," The bag is fucking full and the last person thought there was more room."
"1355680","1356760"," Left in that bag. "
"1357140","1360940"," But they can fit a little bit more in until the next person that there's still a little room and"
"1360940","1361560"," even it's a lie."
"1362940","1369960"," And so when you hear things like when the fed cuts rates, it means they broke something but they"
"1369960","1371580"," haven't told us or we haven't seen it."
"1372300","1375640"," So when you hear that talk out there, it's normally in a high. "
"1376480","1383000"," We're normally cranking on a high plateauing, not like in the depths of hell and we're chasing it"
"1383000","1383240"," down."
"1383240","1389220"," They start that rate cutting to begin to roll over and they chase with more rate cuts as the market"
"1389220","1391540"," rolls over and down to the downside."
"1392040","1393720"," That's about 80 to 90 percent. "
"1393840","1394800"," Oh, no, I shouldn't lie."
"1395060","1400740"," It's about 80 percent of the time if you look in a back check history on rate cuts."
"1401520","1405700"," Now, there's some other ways for the market to go up during rate cuts. "
"1406660","1413160"," But we haven't seen anything, at least from the Treasury Department to validate that."
"1413160","1417260"," That we don't roll on rate cuts."
"1417780","1426620"," So if we're looking for rate cuts in Q4 or Q3 or Q4, I'm going to say probably fucking not. "
"1426800","1427860"," You're probably looking for a high."
"1428360","1429860"," We'll likely get that high from the election."
"1430640","1433080"," And that high can last from December. "
"1433780","1435560"," We finished in December and then even into March."
"1435960","1438500"," So we're just cranking up there and you want to see a rate cut."
"1438640","1440260"," It would make logical sense. "
"1440260","1447520"," It would be going against, going against plebs, people out there saying, what are they talking"
"1447520","1448160"," about rate cuts?"
"1448340","1449680"," We should be raising rates."
"1449860","1451540"," Look at how high the SPX is, right?"
"1452780","1458460"," So it should go counterintuitive to what you think should happen when we get those rate cuts."
"1458980","1467900"," And that, hence, that is where you come up with, if the Fed is cutting rates here, something must"
"1467900","1468380"," be broken. "
"1468380","1471620"," Because the market is up, right?"
"1472200","1472720"," Does that make sense?"
"1475400","1475760"," Okay."
"1482800","1483160"," Okay."
"1483340","1483960"," So what else we're going to read?"
"1484460","1487660"," Houthi is one that they are now in a direct confrontation with the US and UK. "
"1489040","1490680"," Let me ask you guys a question about that."
"1490900","1499340"," Do you think that there's any risk to, for lack of a better word, terrorism from the Houthis with"
"1499340","1502500"," US targets that are not tankers?"
"1502820","1507560"," I haven't heard anyone speaking about that on public and I'm questioning that as well."
"1508920","1515720"," If we're beginning to invite, if we're beginning to invite some form of terrorism, too, there's an"
"1515720","1518360"," expansion of war going on in the Middle East. "
"1519200","1520380"," We all know, right?"
"1520580","1524520"," There's a tent, like, like, come on, drag me into this stuff."
"1525660","1533240"," You saw the Houthis in Iran are changing, or Pakistan in Iran exchanging fire, which is kind of"
"1533240","1535420"," funny because they're hitting each other's terrorist camps."
"1535880","1540540"," It's kind of crazy because I don't know if that's been confirmed enough for the middle of the night"
"1540540","1540920"," last night. "
"1541020","1545620"," They were saying that they're not really, I guess they're attacking each other, but not quite."
"1547940","1551400"," But there's an expansion to some extent, right, of tensions in the Middle East."
"1552240","1556080"," And I always wonder about what's not being said. "
"1556360","1563460"," Is this increasing risk to an event may be happening to the United States' citizens?"
"1563700","1570700"," You know, every three to five years when we don't have something crazy happen, you start expecting"
"1570700","1573100"," something crazy to happen that's unknown to the market."
"1573500","1574800"," We're kind of around that."
"1575680","1579020"," We're starting to, like, hit that moment, right?"
"1579020","1581380"," Then, like, we had COVID was the last big one. "
"1581940","1586360"," So, you know, they tend to happen, like, something unknown to the marketplace."
"1587200","1589420"," The risk rose as time passes."
"1589780","1594300"," So I'm watching that on the back burner, but it's still not meaning anything. "
"1594540","1595780"," It's not meaningful at this point."
"1596700","1598240"," But people are aware of it."
"1598240","1599800"," I'm assuming that you're aware of it as well. "
"1600660","1610620"," I feel he fed manufacturing was negative 10.6 versus negative 7.0. Negative 12.8 was prior initial"
"1610620","1611600"," jobless claims."
"1612400","1616120"," It was 187,000 versus 207,000."
"1616400","1619240"," Expected was 203,000. "
"1621060","1622680"," What else we got here this morning?"
"1624280","1626820"," I think that's all I got for you right now at this moment."
"1628060","1629000"," Economic calendar."
"1630300","1633100"," Today is Thursday, January 18th. "
"1633420","1637540"," For the rest of today, we have Bostik speaking at 12 o'clock today."
"1637760","1639400"," So be aware of that 12 o'clock hour."
"1640480","1644720"," And then on Friday, we've got consumer sentiment of the preliminaries, and then we've got existing"
"1644720","1645340"," home sales. "
"1646140","1648020"," Those are both 10 a.m. tomorrow."
"1648700","1654240"," At 1 p.m. we've got Michael Barr and then Mary Daly speaking at 1 p.m. and 4.15"
"1654240","1655620"," p.m. respectively."
"1657100","1660120"," We've got nothing scheduled for this 22nd. "
"1660260","1660580"," That's Monday."
"1660800","1662000"," Nothing scheduled for Tuesday."
"1663040","1666620"," Then Wednesday, we've got some that we start getting hit with some big data next week. "
"1666920","1669680"," Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we've got serious data coming in."
"1670140","1671860"," PCI, GDP."
"1673080","1676880"," We've got durable goods, PMI, Flash, all that kind of stuff. "
"1677120","1679840"," So we have a busy week coming up next week."
"1681480","1683960"," I still want to see that a little bit more of that bounce."
"1683960","1685520"," I don't think we're quite done here yet. "
"1685680","1691360"," So a little bit more."
"1691440","1692460"," A little bit more to come here."
"1692860","1695560"," Let me read what you guys are saying in the chat right now. "
"1695740","1696440"," Go through the chat here."
"1697260","1698000"," Good morning, everybody."
"1698160","1698740"," Good morning, Harushi. "
"1698980","1699440"," Can not be helped."
"1699680","1700000"," Don boy."
"1700460","1700780"," Binky. "
"1700880","1701440"," How are you doing, brother?"
"1701660","1702680"," Sorry, I haven't gotten back to you."
"1702720","1703540"," I'm crazy busy."
"1704160","1704820"," Stacey F."
"1704980","1705220"," Good morning. "
"1705460","1705800"," Blisswits."
"1706040","1706500"," I love you, brother."
"1708060","1708780"," Rocket Surgeons. "
"1709180","1710020"," Steve M1M1."
"1710520","1711340"," Large Stock Pass."
"1717440","1717980"," Good morning. "
"1718820","1719520"," She came."
"1719920","1722540"," She came out of Princess King."
"1722780","1723560"," I should just call you Kim. "
"1724220","1724600"," Come out."
"1724740","1725060"," Good morning."
"1725160","1725560"," How are you?"
"1725720","1726180"," I'd be crypto. "
"1726500","1727000"," What's going on?"
"1729180","1730960"," Uh, and these events are random."
"1730960","1732640"," How you have more faith in the system than I."
"1732780","1733820"," You know, I don't really have."
"1734880","1735820"," It's a good question. "
"1735820","1736960"," Like do I have faith in the system?"
"1737640","1739060"," Uh, I don't."
"1740060","1742140"," Uh, I don't have faith in the system."
"1742780","1747120"," Uh, I have faith in. "
"1747120","1748660"," What they have to do."
"1749060","1749460"," Maybe."
"1751060","1752040"," That's about it though. "
"1752140","1752940"," Until they break it."
"1753700","1755560"," You know, and they do break it."
"1756340","1759620"," Uh, they intentionally break it even when they know it's broken. "
"1760280","1762300"," Uh, like if they're like, hey, we know it's broken."
"1762300","1763740"," At least that's just, let's break it then."
"1764120","1765880"," You know, it's like a, um. "
"1767360","1767780"," It's like a."
"1768940","1770680"," It's hard to, it's hard to explain."
"1771640","1775260"," Uh, like, let's abuse it as much as we can, right?"
"1775260","1776140"," We've broken it."
"1776240","1777420"," Just abuse the fuck out of it. "
"1777640","1779760"," Every time it breaks, we'll come in and fix it again."
"1780620","1782380"," Remember when they were sitting on the court steps?"
"1782600","1784740"," George Bush was sitting on the court steps."
"1785260","1786940"," You guys know the story behind all that, right?"
"1788100","1789660"," And this is 0708. "
"1790440","1795100"," Uh, there was a moment where US corporations would not make payroll."
"1796360","1800220"," Uh, literally like McDonald's, Walmart's, across the country."
"1800680","1801940"," We're not going to make payroll, right?"
"1802400","1807460"," And, uh, we needed to pass a bill, a spending bill in the Senate. "
"1807660","1816820"," The Senate said something paraphrasing here, but, uh, you know, that, uh, there was, they said we"
"1816820","1818160"," need money like, like today."
"1818620","1822920"," The Senate was like, we can't pass a bill in three days or even one day or one day, let"
"1822920","1823920"," alone three days, right?"
"1824500","1828640"," And, uh, I think Bush was getting like whispered in his air like we need to pass this bill today."
"1828640","1830680"," Uh, so there's money available. "
"1831640","1833600"," It's gonna have rights in the streets of America."
"1834420","1840220"," Uh, so they, they'll break shit to my point here is that Wall Street will break shit and, uh, just"
"1840220","1843220"," come to the fucking steps of the Senate and say we need money today."
"1844080","1846640"," And that's how ruthless they are, right?"
"1847580","1848240"," Absolutely ruthless. "
"1849020","1851700"," Uh, it's, it's like the quest for greed."
"1854140","1860000"," You watch the, uh, three are, uh, Kendall, uh, Kendall, uh, Doc Baker, uh, uh, Doc."
"1860460","1861920"," Or they're, uh, speaking thing. "
"1862100","1862820"," That was wild, right?"
"1863840","1869440"," And a note on that video too, or that wasn't a video, it was an audio from, uh, spaces, uh,"
"1869640","1872380"," from way back, not way back when, but I think it was six months ago or some."
"1873200","1874620"," Uh, think about the context."
"1875840","1881680"," Could've been longer than that, but think about the context of when that, uh, in that interview"
"1881680","1883640"," took place on now at 10, 15. "
"1883980","1885800"," Uh, Thurston howl said he listened to it."
"1885800","1889500"," God is due to be speaking at the low economic forum panel in Dabbos."
"1890140","1894060"," So that, um, that interview took place when. "
"1895100","1901460"," You had some very, or lots of insiders bond insiders, market insiders."
"1903420","1907920"," We're, uh, pushing a narrative of the fed and treasury department."
"1908860","1915240"," Uh, not proceeding. "
"1917280","1919720"," With the amount of QE ever again."
"1922350","1925950"," Uh, that they have, that they provided in the past and the amounts of QT."
"1926850","1929610"," Uh, they had in the past that there would be this, like. "
"1930270","1936230"," This moment of no more, no more greed, I guess, or I don't know how you explain it, but."
"1936230","1942670"," Try to tone down the volatility of the marketplace over, um, higher time frames."
"1943430","1946310"," And these guys, of course, they're like, they're out of their fucking minds. "
"1946510","1948570"," They're lying to you 100% the whole system would collapse."
"1948670","1951190"," These aren't like regular traders, right?"
"1951430","1953670"," Like these guys are, or especially like, uh, Doc Baker guy."
"1954310","1958670"," The guy was like a president of, uh, like the United States bond association or bond trader"
"1958670","1960670"," association or something like that. "
"1960750","1962910"," That guy's a, that guy's legit real, real guy."
"1962910","1969750"," So that was a fascinating conversation, especially in the face of what was being pushed on public."
"1973150","1974910"," I didn't see the, uh, Cat William stuff. "
"1975890","1978830"," Uh, homie, let me, let me bounce through the chat here and say good morning, everybody."
"1980390","1983690"," Uh, go over to Twitch really quick."
"1983830","1984050"," Good morning. "
"1984210","1984310"," Twitch."
"1984450","1985330"," How are you all doing out there?"
"1985450","1985710"," Green man."
"1985850","1986130"," Good morning. "
"1986910","1987730"," JT limit buyer."
"1994190","1994310"," Twitch."
"1994770","1995250"," Vengeful. "
"1995370","1995630"," Silent."
"1996230","2003450"," By the way, if you want to chat here, uh, if you're watching on YouTube or on Twitch, if you"
"2003450","2006610"," want to chat, we, so we started charging five bucks for the chat."
"2007590","2009890"," Uh, it was mostly to keep out scammers. "
"2010930","2017230"," Russian bots, uh, hit and run commenters at tops and bottoms in the market and keep our alpha"
"2017230","2017930"," cleaned up."
"2018290","2021370"," Now, um, there is a way to chat for free."
"2021370","2026410"," There is, there is an option, but it's that one extra step to keep the bots and the scammers and"
"2026410","2027090"," all that out of there. "
"2027350","2034870"," If you are watching on YouTube, you can watch us on Twitch and, uh, subscribe via Amazon Prime"
"2034870","2035250"," Gaming."
"2035910","2038970"," It's free to you and you can chat on Twitch."
"2039350","2043430"," If you haven't used, I'm not them trying to push people from YouTube to Twitch, but, uh, Twitch,"
"2043610","2047030"," Twitch's interface is very, very nice. "
"2047030","2050710"," You can, like, remove the windows while you're doing other stuff."
"2050969","2053370"," Just listen on your phone while you're doing something else."
"2054230","2057290"," Uh, and also it's natively in real time. "
"2057750","2065750"," YouTube has a native delay where you have to speed up the live stream at key moments, uh, to be"
"2065750","2066310"," real time."
"2066850","2068150"," Twitch though is, is real time."
"2068310","2068949"," It's like second. "
"2069230","2070969"," It's like from where I am to where you are."
"2071070","2073989"," It's like one to three seconds, uh, delay."
"2073989","2076830"," So, uh, you can chat via Twitch if you like. "
"2077330","2081810"," If you didn't, if never used Twitch, uh, I never used Twitch in the past."
"2082510","2086650"," And so of course it's like bumbling and the first time you use it and you're like, I don't know"
"2086650","2087230"," if I want to do that."
"2087350","2090590"," I like, I'm comfortable with YouTube, uh, stay on YouTube. "
"2090889","2095550"," But if you want to chat, you can always, uh, I don't know, maybe mute and have the show on"
"2095550","2096290"," in two different places."
"2096530","2099330"," Watch it on YouTube and then just chat on Twitch, something like that."
"2099410","2101170"," There is an option, a free option though for you. "
"2105880","2106800"," Worryness, how are you?"
"2107600","2110400"," Uh, what do I think of AMC in its current state?"
"2111780","2112500"," Uh, AMC."
"2113500","2114560"," Uh, I'm not a fan of the CEO."
"2115340","2118520"," And I know he did the CEO admitted years ago. "
"2119220","2120840"," Uh, years spent four or five years."
"2121040","2125540"," He was sitting in his shitty office and he's got probably rent controlled in New York."
"2125860","2128280"," And he was like, what did he say?"
"2128280","2131300"," He said, I've got shares at a dollar 50 or 60. "
"2131800","2137240"," I think that's his, uh, his, um, uh, total, total cost right in shares."
"2137920","2141400"," And I think he even admitted like I'll loan them out to him ever to short it down to the"
"2141400","2141580"," ground."
"2141800","2142820"," So I don't think that guy cares. "
"2143680","2145600"," Um, we'll talk about AMC in a moment."
"2145800","2147000"," We'll talk about GME too."
"2147140","2148440"," There's a lot going on in GME. "
"2149900","2151800"," Uh, matter of fact, we're going to write some of this stuff down."
"2151920","2152240"," Hold on here."
"2153540","2154680"," Cause we're going to talk about ER. "
"2155220","2157320"," We're going to talk about AMC and GME."
"2157860","2159240"," Uh, GME specifically."
"2160540","2162400"," Has got me scratching my head here. "
"2170150","2171490"," Uh, so worryness."
"2171530","2173130"," We'll talk about both of those this morning."
"2173570","2174190"," Fair town sheriff. "
"2174390","2174690"," How are you?"
"2175990","2176770"," Uh, trader podcast."
"2177190","2177670"," What's up, brother?"
"2179210","2179650"," Yeah."
"2179890","2181090"," Oil has to pump at some point. "
"2181290","2182450"," Uh, absolutely."
"2182850","2183230"," I agree with that."
"2183330","2183470"," David. "
"2187490","2188750"," Yes, trader podcast."
"2189390","2191630"," Uh, give me, um, trader podcast."
"2192470","2194610"," Can you want to come on to the show?"
"2194970","2198170"," Even if it's just audio and we'll talk about that list this morning. "
"2198710","2200130"," We could probably do that first."
"2201110","2202950"," If you don't want to do a, um."
"2204150","2206010"," If you don't want to do a video. "
"2206930","2208610"," Uh, do you want to jump on the show?"
"2208730","2210070"," Let me just chat briefly or no."
"2210490","2211610"," Uh, let me know the chat, brother."
"2212830","2213570"," Green man. "
"2213730","2214430"," Thank you for subscribing."

"2241590","2242910"," I'm going to chat in streams. "
"2243390","2245410"," Pork just made it super easy for you."
"2246430","2252770"," So inside of you, inside of Twitch, Pork just showed a link to on how to sign up to chat"
"2252770","2253470"," for free."
"2256190","2256870"," Thanks, Pork. "
"2257030","2257690"," I appreciate that."
"2260920","2262180"," Uh, sweet trader podcast."
"2262520","2263320"," What, when do you want to do it, man?"
"2263420","2264060"," You want to do it right now?"
"2264680","2265780"," What's a good time for you?"
"2266960","2270500"," Uh, drop a time inside of the chat now. "
"2271460","2271860"," Set it up."

"2297170","2298390"," So what are you looking for here?"
"2298470","2299990"," If you're a bull, do you know what you're looking for?"
"2299990","2300930"," That's before."
"2301150","2301230"," All right."
"2301330","2302770"," So prepare podcast will be five seconds. "
"2303290","2306550"," If you're new to the stream, what are you looking for here?"
"2306690","2307010"," Do you know?"
"2309470","2312270"," You've got an intraday basis, small pivots, right?"
"2312450","2313450"," You got this pivot here."
"2314110","2315590"," You got that pivot right there."
"2315750","2317470"," And you got that pivot right there, right?"
"2318830","2324510"," Uh, if we are going, if we are going to get a reversal of the upside, you're looking for the"
"2324510","2326890"," one minute trigger and the five minute trigger to flatten. "
"2326890","2331110"," And then you're looking for a cross to the upside of that stuff, right?"
"2331430","2338240"," So you got, you first of all, you've got your, uh, you got your back check that looks like it's,"
"2338260","2339400"," it's, it's working here."
"2340000","2342540"," And then you're looking for a cross here, right?"
"2344200","2346100"," Of the red line, that's the five minute trigger."
"2346280","2348520"," And then we've got the one minute trigger here cross here. "
"2350140","2350520"," Right."
"2350800","2351920"," And that, what is this right here?"
"2352000","2353040"," That's a bull cross, right?"
"2354600","2356140"," On a one and five minute basis."
"2357420","2357480"," Right?"
"2357480","2358880"," Bull cross, one and five minute basis. "
"2361280","2363260"," We're looking for price to do what?"
"2364280","2368340"," We're looking, we're actually watching to see if there's good will from buyers here, right?"
"2369980","2375820"," So I'd really like to see just the tip, right?"
"2376040","2376720"," We like to see that."
"2382560","2386660"," Come back down here, test that cross, right?"
"2388160","2389920"," That cross becomes successful."
"2391300","2393500"," And we're then looking for the next tip, right?"
"2393920","2394240"," Right there. "
"2394380","2395120"," Just a little break."
"2395500","2397340"," It doesn't have to, but we like to see it, right?"
"2397960","2399620"," The will of buyers, right?"
"2399800","2401380"," Demand is strong here, right?"
"2402560","2404840"," You tag that second one."
"2405340","2406920"," Come back down right here. "
"2408060","2413880"," And we know after this here and that here that the market is, or the buyers are showing up, right?"
"2414740","2417080"," This would be your big buy right here as we go along."
"2417080","2419300"," Your percentages get better and better."
"2420020","2424000"," 15% chance, 30% chance, 60% chance. "
"2425000","2425780"," And then boom."
"2426700","2427540"," You're up here, right?"
"2427700","2428620"," Now you're tagging this one."
"2429460","2430520"," Come back down right here. "
"2430580","2432920"," And this is your 95% winner right in here."
"2433940","2438800"," That's where you, if you've done this one, two, three, you're going to start having higher and"
"2438800","2440700"," higher percentages for us to go up here."
"2441200","2443640"," So your most consistent money is right in there. "
"2444520","2447660"," Okay, so we'll watch how this plays out and see if that happens."
"2448060","2449760"," Now, so this is the plan, right?"
"2450560","2454160"," If it goes against us, what are we looking for, right?"
"2454820","2457880"," Like a failure of demand, right?"
"2458060","2463000"," You can see, if you see failure demand, start to break down here, reverse here to the downside,"
"2463000","2463600"," right?"
"2464740","2468860"," Your pain is in here, your stops are actually up here, right?"
"2470020","2473040"," So let's say you're taking along here, like I'm along right here, Captain."
"2474780","2476120"," But then price fails. "
"2476960","2478380"," Liquidation break, you're panicking."
"2479020","2480960"," You're like, I'm cutting my calls here, Captain."
"2481380","2482420"," It wouldn't ruin reality. "
"2482800","2486980"," You should have waited to come back up with a failure here and the closing the door in a bowl."
"2487300","2488940"," That's where your downside is right there."
"2495300","2496300"," Okay, trader podcast. "
"2496580","2497580"," Let me just two seconds here."
"2498260","2500940"," Trader podcast, can you do me a solid and, oh, you know what?"
"2501420","2502740"," I'll just do it on Twitter DM."

"2504880","2505940"," We want a quick second."
"2507160","2508480"," I'm going to set this up here."

"2535620","2539120"," I'm marking it and I don't get you on camera here. "
"2539120","2541740"," It does say that anecdotal data is key to go."
"2541840","2543420"," It's a key guide for policymakers there."
"2543740","2548420"," So again, send your link to your DM's brother releasing an essay today for the Philadelphia Fed,"
"2548780","2550420"," not commenting on monetary policy. "
"2550680","2552920"," It says that anecdotal data is key."
"2553220","2554600"," All right, there's a link, my man."
"2558260","2558720"," Boom. "
"2559660","2560580"," Save that."

"2640360","2641140"," Fair podcast."
"2641420","2641660"," Are you here?"
"2642900","2643820"," Say something, brother. "

"2677340","2681200"," The dollar seems to be retracing its pump from this morning."
"2681420","2682400"," So I like seeing that. "
"2683080","2687200"," But what I really wanted to talk about is opx and opx is coming tomorrow."

"2694960","2701600"," you know, whoever has talked about how this is a pretty big opx that's coming up tomorrow."
"2701980","2704980"," The reason it's really big is because. "
"2706540","2711520"," Every year when for single stocks new options get opened, they get opened for January."
"2712080","2714280"," That's the longest one you can usually open for."
"2714360","2715680"," So if you go look at any of the. "
"2716260","2719320"," Of the tickers, you'll see that there's a January."
"2720000","2721420"," Option for 2025."

"2722640","2724820"," These long positions get opened."
"2726120","2729340"," Usually, you know, 10, 15 months in advance."
"2730420","2732320"," And when these expire. "
"2733500","2739700"," They lead to a lot of gamma in these individual stock pickers getting."
"2740900","2741740"," Removed."
"2741960","2747160"," So what you see on your screen right now is a list of. "
"2747700","2749640"," 25 of the top."
"2750420","2751260"," Experience."
"2751840","2753840"," For tomorrow's opx. "
"2754240","2756480"," So let me explain what I mean by that."
"2757960","2764080"," So these tickers, like, for example, NMM, which is Navios."
"2764600","2766660"," They are a shipping company. "
"2767280","2771260"," Now it is trading close to its call wall at 30."
"2772380","2778620"," And about 88% of all calls, which are in the money or at $30."
"2779800","2780700"," Expire tomorrow. "
"2781580","2782540"," Now, what does that mean?"
"2783180","2789620"," So when calls are in the money, the market makers have to hedge against that."
"2789940","2790540"," Right."
"2790740","2795920"," Tomorrow, when those calls get either assigned or they get rolled to the upside. "
"2796840","2799040"," What's going to happen is all that sticky gamma."
"2799880","2803540"," All the hedging that the market makers have to do."
"2804280","2805640"," For these tickers. "
"2806100","2806840"," Goes away."
"2806840","2810000"," So they can sell the underlying that they have been forwarding for a while."
"2810200","2816580"," That's leads to a lot of weakness in these tickers is what the theory goes. "
"2817000","2820600"," Now people can buy more calls between today and tomorrow."
"2820780","2823680"," Create like a gamma position above the call wall."
"2824200","2827420"," And we might continue to stick up here or go a little bit further up. "
"2827780","2828200"," But."
"2829200","2835160"," Because like in a lot of these cases, you see more than 50% of all calls."
"2835160","2839700"," Get evaporated tomorrow or expire tomorrow, not evaporated. "
"2839920","2840660"," That's the wrong word."
"2840880","2841620"," They expire tomorrow."
"2842380","2843580"," And because they expire tomorrow. "
"2844580","2847120"," Going into next week and the week after."
"2847500","2851120"," Before banner and charm really start like, you know, doing their thing."
"2852420","2856500"," You're going to see weakness in some of these names. "
"2857100","2861640"," Now, there's a couple of names on here that I do want to tell people to be."
"2861640","2865380"," A little bit careful of because this is only an equities list."
"2865720","2868260"," Fxy, which is number seven over there. "
"2869120","2870320"," Is the yen."
"2871100","2875000"," And the yen trades in multiple markets, not just the spot ETF."
"2875980","2877940"," So that's something to kind of think about. "
"2878320","2880160"," You know, you might not want to short the yen."
"2880540","2884300"," Or if you want to go ahead, but know that that is an incomplete picture."
"2884740","2887100"," Just because this is only showing equities and calls. "
"2887100","2888660"," Expiring for equities."
"2889140","2893980"," Similarly, number 15 is GLD gold gold trades in multiple ETFs."
"2894180","2899080"," It trades in spot markets trades in futures markets. "
"2899560","2901220"," So that is something to kind of think about."
"2901600","2903200"," You know, you might not want to do that."
"2903440","2905600"," I would personally. "
"2906460","2909940"," Draw your eyes to number 22, which is meta."
"2910840","2914060"," Meta currently is 373 last I checked."
"2914920","2919120"," And that is very close to its call wall at. "
"2919900","2927020"," 375 and a significant amount of call volume expires on."
"2928240","2930240"," I'll tell you exactly how much."
"2935210","2939830"," 49.98% of all calls and meta expire tomorrow. "
"2940750","2943610"," As opposed to 4.7% of puts."
"2943610","2945910"," So that is something to think about."
"2946090","2947370"," If you are going to. "
"2949450","2955190"," If you're going to think about shorting mega caps, like that's the one that like I am personally"
"2955190","2955870"," looking at."
"2956050","2957350"," I'm also looking at."
"2958730","2960330"," Chipotle Mexican drill. "
"2960930","2963890"," Because that is very close to."
"2966310","2967710"," That's very close to."
"2969510","2971270"," Exbury and like very close to the price. "
"2971810","2974830"," And about 36% of all calls."
"2975630","2977670"," Expire on there, but these are in the money calls."
"2977970","2979490"," So it makes it a lot more interesting. "
"2980950","2985870"," So that's kind of what a lot of people have been looking at when they talk about that."
"2986030","2988850"," There's going to be weakness because this is a big expiry."
"2989150","2990710"," This is a bigger expiry. "
"2991390","2997730"," This year, then the 2023 gen expiry was, and that was the largest on history on record."
"2998050","3000850"," So this is now the largest single stock."
"3001590","3002810"," Exbury on record. "
"3003350","3005070"," So yeah, that's kind of like what I wanted to."
"3007450","3008530"," Wanted to talk about."
"3008870","3010510"," And yeah, so here's the other thing too. "
"3010590","3011750"," I see somebody's talk to me."
"3011810","3012750"," Bork is talking about."
"3013910","3015490"," Two poor for Chipotle though. "
"3015650","3017150"," Yeah, you can sell call spreads."
"3017790","3020030"," That's a lot more doable to make some money."
"3020030","3025570"," You could sell call spreads, let's say at 2350 and 2355 or something. "
"3026230","3033310"," And that's going to cost you $500 in premium, but you might be able to collect, you know, a nice"
"3033310","3034910"," 30, 40% return on that."
"3035470","3040570"," So yeah, so that's some of the ways to think about what you're doing."
"3040570","3043550"," But anyways, these are the places where we would see some weakness. "
"3044210","3047350"," A lot of these are also things that have done well, like RCL."
"3048270","3049690"," RCL is Royal Caribbean."
"3050630","3053590"," Booking.com, you know, they've kind of been on a tear. "
"3053710","3054410"," These two tickers."
"3054590","3058850"," So you kind of want to like, you know, reflexively short them as well."
"3058910","3060470"," But now is the time to take your shot. "
"3062580","3068240"," Do any questions in the chat if you are on YouTube or on Twitch?"
"3069300","3073660"," If you guys want to give a shout out to the Trader podcast, that deep fake master, right?"
"3074060","3074720"," I saw that comment."
"3074720","3079340"," You guys have any questions on some of the tick or maybe you have a ticker out there that you're"
"3079340","3085560"," looking to short as the scammer rolls off single tickers into the end of the week here."
"3085740","3087960"," Any questions about your favorite ticker out there?"
"3088440","3090380"," I have my spreadsheet open in front of me. "
"3090640","3092800"," I can look up any tickers."
"3093100","3096960"," Yeah, if somebody lists them, I can tell you how much is expiring."
"3098120","3098520"," Sweet. "
"3098540","3102480"," So if you have a ticker, you want to find out if they are near their call wall."
"3102480","3108520"," And if they have a bunch of their calls rolling off the market into Friday."
"3109940","3115280"," And you're interested to find out if there will be an attempt to short that ticker list them in the"
"3115280","3115480"," chat. "
"3116620","3117560"," Okay, Tesla."
"3118220","3118980"," That's the first one."
"3119880","3120220"," Let's see. "
"3121000","3127380"," Tesla's call wall is 240 and there's 51% of call volume expiring."
"3128440","3129360"," Ooh, tomorrow."
"3132340","3137840"," Water boy is asking does this hold for the inverse say if puts are deep in the money, then calls. "
"3139240","3140040"," I really."
"3141080","3145760"," Directs that ideally theoretically, yes, that's what that means, but there's not a lot of in the"
"3145760","3149560"," money puts for a lot of these tickers."
"3149560","3151920"," I can look at SMCI. "
"3152500","3155440"," You've got AMD MBLY."
"3155460","3157000"," I love MBLY."
"3157280","3160360"," They got torn down last last year. "
"3160460","3163080"," Call wall is at 350 and."
"3166340","3171660"," Next expiration call volume percentage, which is tomorrow is 52%."
"3172320","3175000"," But out of all the call. "
"3175890","3178880"," Only 30% is expiring on SMCI."
"3180160","3181300"," On SMCI."
"3181820","3182960"," That was for Doug Fuller. "
"3183820","3184260"," Yeah."
"3184440","3185160"," And then move Lee."
"3186800","3188140"," Yeah, I'm being a lot. "
"3188560","3190160"," Yeah, I like."
"3190940","3191880"," It's a whole job."
"3192140","3192440"," Yeah, mobile. "
"3193480","3194900"," Call wall is at 30."
"3196100","3200220"," And 56% of all the call volume is expiring."
"3200220","3208290"," At home, if you want right now, as you get into the next tickers, do yourself a solid here. "
"3208470","3213030"," We don't this is I don't believe this is on public, but what I want you guys to do is"
"3213030","3214830"," get out your get out your."
"3215850","3217250"," Snipping tools at home."
"3219030","3225030"," And if you want, take a quick picture of this list that's in front of you right now. "
"3227310","3229690"," Then also we also have AMD."
"3231370","3233110"," Right now, right?"
"3233310","3233710"," Where do you do that?"
"3233750","3234090"," What or no?"
"3234410","3235090"," We didn't move."
"3235290","3237530"," And I am looking at GoDaddy. "
"3238030","3238490"," It's 20."
"3239030","3239390"," It's."
"3240270","3241170"," It's 2%. "
"3241170","3241930"," How much?"
"3241930","3242790"," 2% is expiring."
"3242890","3244510"," 2% is expiring calls."
"3245350","3247110"," So go Daddy should not much. "
"3247530","3249910"," Go Daddy should not get impacted too much by that."
"3250210","3251190"," And then AMD."
"3252790","3255470"," I suspect this is going to call wall was at 150. "
"3255830","3257630"," It's already blown past as call wall."
"3258510","3264990"," And 56.57%. So all this data is from last night."
"3265830","3269390"," So I just want to tell people that it's all from last night. "
"3270070","3274930"," And given how much like where AMD is right now, I'd expect even more."
"3275510","3277690"," Weekly to have come in."
"3277910","3281430"," So more calls would be expiring, but it's about 57%. "
"3281430","3282350"," For AMD."
"3283050","3283510"," BA."
"3284310","3284490"," Sure. "
"3284670","3285310"," I'll look at BA."
"3290030","3299970"," So 33% of call volume is expiring, but only 10% of all call."
"3300310","3301430"," Is expiring. "
"3304130","3309010"," And interestingly, 33% of puts are also expiring."
"3309770","3311070"," Oh, no kidding."
"3311570","3312430"," Yeah. "
"3313150","3316550"," So it's pretty evenly balanced for Boeing."
"3317230","3319370"," Now, I just got a question."
"3319610","3320990"," Captain, do you want me to answer this?"
"3321150","3324510"," Because I could kind of get into a little bit more. "
"3324630","3326250"," All right."
"3326490","3329070"," So the question is from stretching walls."
"3329070","3334310"," Any additional insights on SPX or NDX that add any depth to what taps been saying about call and"
"3334310","3334750"," put walls. "
"3336230","3342790"," So I, if you see on my Twitter yesterday, I posted a long thread about volatility."
"3343890","3346610"," And like, I talked to Chum Carson."
"3347110","3348110"," I talked to all signals. "
"3348910","3350410"," I talked to options depth."
"3350870","3356370"," We, I tried to amalgamate all of the stuff that they are talking about to get a better"
"3356370","3358190"," understanding of how I want to position myself."
"3358730","3364030"," So what I've been looking at is the implied volatility across SPX. "
"3365570","3372170"," And what I'm specifically looking for is there more put demand than there is called demand."
"3372910","3382430"," And so far, what I'm seeing is that going into February 9th and February 16th, our spot is right"
"3382430","3384010"," now at 4755."
"3385130","3394750"," The IV right now is more than 1.5 standard deviations higher than what it has been in the last"
"3394750","3395350"," two months. "
"3395350","3404110"," So statistically, there is more demand for puts right now because of"
"3404110","3408410"," the perceived weakness and people want to hedge."
"3408830","3411190"," Now, when people want to hedge, that could mean two things."
"3411350","3416570"," It could be downside speculators that are buying stuff or there's money in the market that is"
"3416570","3417570"," trying to protect itself. "
"3418310","3422210"," So I don't think we are going to get a big crash."
"3422810","3424310"," That's my current working thesis."
"3424310","3429250"," Because vol is getting more expensive. "
"3430130","3433050"," That means dealers can come in and sell more vol."
"3433510","3436010"," That has been the story for the last nine months."
"3436590","3445710"," We've been systematically writing puts seven days out, 30 days out and gaining delta from that. "
"3445890","3447950"," I mean, people haven't collecting data from that."
"3448390","3450610"," And that kind of puts a floor under the market."
"3450610","3453310"," It had gotten, IV had gotten solo. "
"3453770","3455570"," It was a 12.5 handle."
"3456330","3459430"," And at that point, it doesn't even make sense to sell volatility."
"3459950","3463690"," So we were not, people were not selling volatility as much. "
"3463810","3467570"," And that's why we kind of saw a bit in volatility, the last two, the last two or three days."
"3468530","3476610"," So what I'm trying to say here is once IV rises, it makes sense for dealers to sell."
"3477510","3479610"," But there is a lot more demand right now. "
"3479610","3482110"," So I don't expect there to be a big crash."
"3482830","3488870"," What I expect is if we're going to get a downside move, it's going to be stair stepped down with"
"3488870","3491810"," an occasional rip in the middle that you sell down as well."
"3492250","3498150"," You know, something we saw in late 2020 to week might see something similar. "
"3498610","3501670"," Now, well, that's a nice bear candle."
"3503210","3507050"," So anyways, that's my current working thesis."
"3507050","3510070"," I am cautiously optimistic to the upside. "
"3511810","3519390"," But I am very cognizant of the fact that, you know, there is overhanging macro."
"3520110","3524310"," And this is a window of weakness as chem cars on likes to say."
"3524610","3525650"," And we're in the middle of it. "
"3525730","3531070"," And both of those can cause things to, you know, slide down."
"3531270","3533090"," But I don't think it's going to be a big slide down."
"3534950","3537230"," So, yeah, I hope that answers your question. "
"3538350","3540090"," What does Coney look like?"
"3540630","3540830"," Okay."
"3542350","3547730"," YouTube's asking some questions about coin, docu, Etsy, Mara."
"3548170","3548530"," So coin. "
"3549370","3549850"," Coin."
"3549990","3550110"," Sure."
"3550350","3551050"," Give me one second. "
"3551270","3554290"," I think we're going to show just a bit of love to the YouTube crowd really quick."
"3554870","3555350"," For sure."
"3555870","3557710"," Fifty-two percent of call volume expires. "
"3558850","3559850"," Thirty percent of call volume."
"3560390","3562870"," Fifty-two percent of call volume."
"3565170","3567610"," And 43 percent of the put volume. "
"3568510","3570010"," So that neutral."
"3571030","3571950"," Almost neutral."
"3572210","3576130"," And it's, you know, it's call wall is in 165. "
"3576650","3577750"," It's put wall is at 135."
"3579250","3583290"," I wouldn't expect it to slide down that much further."
"3583370","3585350"," They should kind of act as support. "
"3585750","3588190"," You know, the 130 to 135 region."
"3589570","3590850"," All right."
"3590850","3590910"," Okay. "
"3591270","3592130"," So coin."
"3592630","3592990"," Docu."
"3593150","3593230"," Yeah. "
"3593410","3593690"," Sure."
"3593890","3594590"," Give me one second."
"3596590","3597310"," Is. "
"3600910","3601990"," Twenty eight."
"3602150","3602690"," Twenty eight."
"3602790","3604530"," Twenty eight point five percent call volume expiring. "
"3604530","3606710"," And forty percent of put volume expiring."
"3608070","3609290"," For docu sign."
"3609610","3610330"," Etsy. "
"3616580","3620520"," Eleven percent call volume expiring and."
"3621940","3625740"," Eleven percent almost same in put volume expiring."
"3626080","3626340"," So. "
"3627040","3627840"," Not too much."
"3627840","3629300"," And it's not too much there."
"3629360","3630460"," And it's call wall is at 80. "
"3630820","3632000"," And it's put wall is at 74."
"3633460","3634000"," Yeah."
"3636760","3639740"," Bitcoin stocks are pretty popular right now. "
"3640120","3640580"," Okay."
"3641780","3642020"," Let's see."
"3643460","3644740"," Put wall is at 22. "
"3645720","3646740"," Call wall is at 30."
"3646740","3649700"," Fifty six percent of call volume expiring."
"3650220","3652880"," And fifty seven percent of put volume expiring. "
"3653120","3653840"," So about the same."
"3654760","3660380"," What else we got here is what Camel is asking, would that imply weakness for AMD tomorrow?"
"3662060","3663500"," I would suggest so."
"3664080","3665380"," It would look like that. "
"3665960","3669940"," But, you know, all the semis are kind of pumping right now."
"3670800","3675280"," But I would suspect given how it's at all time highs."
"3675820","3680280"," Right before one of the biggest off X is does not make me feel. "
"3681480","3683260"," Terribly bullish at this point."
"3683920","3684900"," To purchase AMD."
"3685820","3687140"," How about I say it like that?"
"3687360","3688160"," It's a good way to say it. "
"3688680","3688940"," Yeah."
"3689280","3690380"," And don't I want you guys up."
"3690540","3693140"," If you're watching right now, I'm listening to trader podcast. "
"3693860","3694720"," At this moment."
"3695200","3698980"," You know, the thing about this is we're presenting information to you."
"3698980","3699360"," It's not. "
"3699880","3702920"," Hey, this is going to happen or that is going to happen."
"3703820","3708100"," Oftentimes, the Twitter mob and twin mob likes to go out there and just like burn people to the"
"3708100","3708320"," ground."
"3708840","3712660"," You go find their profile and they add nothing to the conversation. "
"3713400","3718860"," So take this not to take up as a grain of salt or anything, but take it as another piece"
"3718860","3720640"," of information for your decision making."
"3721380","3725540"," And your education that you're doing on your own thesis out there."
"3726400","3729340"," We have also have pinky asking about FDX. "
"3729560","3730920"," He's been asking about FDX."
"3731440","3731460"," Yeah."
"3731460","3734760"," I like by the way, for what it's worth. "
"3735080","3738400"," I really like FedEx and the turnaround story they've got going on."
"3739180","3743920"," And FedEx 10% of its call, sorry, 22% of its call volume expires."
"3745320","3748760"," And a 9% of its put volume. "
"3749540","3753740"," And it's call wall is at 260 and it's put wall is at 245."
"3754840","3756480"," So it's kind of right, right in the middle."
"3756480","3763640"," I would expect there would be more secular secular things that might move. "
"3764960","3767840"," FedEx than just options positioning."
"3768240","3773180"," Now, remember like this list that I showed you is like where I would expect options getting removed"
"3773180","3778900"," to impact the stock most than other things."
"3778900","3785120"," There's, you know, I have all 3200 stocks on here and my spreadsheet and their positioning on"
"3785120","3785360"," there. "
"3785480","3788820"," So, you know, it's not a little bit of work."
"3789180","3793060"," I'm fascinated that you're bringing that up because pinky has brought that up as well."
"3793360","3798720"," What you're talking about with the secular or the news surrounding or the environment surrounding"
"3798720","3799820"," FedEx and UPS. "
"3800720","3806820"," Pinky, we might have to have you on man and talk about some of your thesis is on FedEx right"
"3806820","3807080"," now."
"3807080","3812160"," I'm fascinated that trader podcast is bringing up the same stuff that you have on FedEx."
"3815580","3819440"," So big, if you're hearing that, if you want to come on at some point and just chat about FedEx"
"3819440","3821880"," or UPS, we could do it today if you want to. "
"3824420","3825700"," Okay, so let's go back over to."
"3825840","3828960"," It looks like we got a bunch of questions done on YouTube on."
"3829200","3832600"," Let's go back to Twitch really quick to what those guys are saying. "
"3835080","3836600"," Work, you want what?"
"3841640","3842320"," Lily."
"3843240","3846200"," So, yes, Sam wants to look at a lot why."
"3848320","3850660"," They increase the prices yesterday. "
"3850700","3852620"," So that's, that's bullish, right?"
"3855040","3858900"," 32% of the call volume expires and."
"3861140","3863320"," 51% of the put volume expires."
"3865460","3873180"," This would also feed into the fact that if tech is going to get rotated out of because, you know. "
"3873720","3877800"," Keep on taking profits, because it's been up so much the last year."
"3878860","3882560"," Rotation into health care would kind of support this too."
"3882740","3888000"," Anyway, so I believe in the, I believe in a large rotation into health care. "
"3888600","3889120"," Yeah."
"3889400","3890040"," I'm long."
"3890280","3893620"," Especially equipment's health care equipment, but. "
"3894740","3896140"," Well, yeah, no, that makes sense."
"3896800","3900740"," So let's go back to a little why it's call wall is at 650."
"3901520","3903120"," It's put wall is at 625. "
"3904920","3910540"," The largest gamma band outside of those two, so which will act as like support is 630."
"3911400","3916800"," 32% of call volume expiring 52% of put volume expiring tomorrow."
"3919140","3923400"," And so actually, I could put this into numbers. "
"3923940","3926100"," Almost 5 billion in call delta."
"3927100","3928540"," Is present."
"3929940","3930740"," On. "
"3931460","3931860"," L."
"3931960","3932220"," Y."
"3932840","3934140"," And that's going to like impact."
"3936500","3940360"," How the stock responded might not pump immediately, but I would definitely."
"3940720","3943640"," I could see a pump in its near future next week. "
"3944520","3946200"," So I have another question for you here."
"3946780","3948040"," Chair podcast would be."
"3948820","3949780"," Or not question. "
"3950260","3951400"," This is for."
"3951940","3952460"," Let me see."
"3952560","3953860"," I'm bringing this up here for everybody. "
"3957170","3960330"," So this is in line with."
"3961170","3963750"," All these, all these single ticker expiries."
"3963750","3969970"," You also can see the gamma on SPX rolling off. "
"3970610","3973430"," For a culmination into Friday of 180 million."
"3973670","3976830"," You got 50 million 42 20 today."
"3976930","3977230"," That's Thursday. "
"3977690","3977790"," Right."
"3978150","3980990"," But then Friday at the big bad boy here minus 180 million."
"3980990","3986190"," This is invariably half of the call gamma on the market expiring this Friday. "
"3986970","3987670"," Mm hmm."
"3987670","3988110"," Mm hmm."
"3988670","3991710"," And you know what's really interesting about that to cap. "
"3992570","3998690"," We were in such high positive market gamma that that's what we kept seeing."
"3998850","4000550"," We kept seeing like all dips getting bought."
"4000990","4004730"," If we rally too hard during the day, we saw mean reversions down. "
"4005150","4009030"," That's very characteristic of positive gamma regimes."
"4010210","4015470"," When you get a negative and so we even though we've lost all this gamma, we are still positive"
"4015470","4016590"," gamma in the market."
"4017250","4020610"," So markets are still the positioning is still somewhat supportive. "
"4020610","4026630"," Of the indices specifically SPX and that's kind of what we're seeing yesterday."
"4026710","4029350"," It got to just above neutral."
"4030630","4035810"," It had lost shed a lot of a lot of it's a positive market gamma on SPX. "
"4036070","4037570"," We got just above neutral."
"4037850","4041530"," So still slightly positive and now we're seeing supportive flows come in today."
"4041610","4042650"," It's what we're seeing today. "
"4043330","4046290"," And the thing is."
"4046290","4053170"," I think you said this once and it resonated with me so deeply that I say it all the time."
"4053650","4056630"," All time highs are made with volatility. "
"4057570","4058290"," Mm hmm."
"4058990","4065730"," So what we're seeing if we tomorrow when a lot of this gamma flips off, like goes off, right, we"
"4065730","4072090"," will be negative gamma territory, which by definition means volatility is going to be higher."
"4072090","4076370"," We are going to either get big rips or we're going to get big dips. "
"4076950","4077550"," Right."
"4077670","4079730"," That's what everybody is like looking forward to."
"4080130","4083730"," Now that to me, given where we are, like around 475. "
"4085090","4090610"," You know, we're within a percent and a percent and a quarter of all time highs."
"4091110","4095910"," So that's what like really like has me thinking a little counterintuitively."
"4096689","4099590"," As opposed to all the tumors on fin to it. "
"4099590","4107229"," I honestly think we could make all time highs and keep running till Valentine's day."
"4107830","4109250"," I really think so."
"4109410","4109810"," I agree. "
"4111130","4117830"," And if we if we do and then Valentine's day is where I would be like, okay, this is kind"
"4117830","4124229"," of the point where I, you know, step off the gas a little bit, think a little bit more about,"
"4124229","4131729"," you know, the downside or just sitting on the sidelines with cash, collecting money in my money"
"4131729","4135470"," market account and then just buying the dip when that happens."
"4136090","4138290"," So there's another tool I'll show you."
"4138290","4139630"," It's a very naive tool. "
"4140310","4142149"," And I generated every night."
"4142790","4144430"," I like my man."
"4144729","4145430"," I got to be honest. "
"4147090","4152649"," I, uh, for a long time, I complicated my thinking."
"4152649","4159290"," I got like, go down the rabbit hole, learn so much stuff, and did more disservice to me than just"
"4159290","4161529"," understanding the basic mechanics of how the market moves."
"4161850","4164149"," So you did show, tell them about it. "
"4164490","4169810"," I'm going to, I'm generating it right now, and I'm going to send it to you because it's going to"
"4169810","4173850"," be a picture of IDM and then you could probably pull it up."
"4174229","4179390"," You are correct, by the way, the 14th of February would be the top of the market for a major"
"4179390","4185069"," corrective move to the downside in to March 21st, February 14th, March 21st."
"4185310","4185970"," Good job, bro. "
"4186609","4187250"," Right on."
"4187790","4188810"," I like you."
"4189450","4189950"," Always have. "
"4190090","4190950"," I know you like me."
"4193210","4194170"," Always have."
"4196190","4196870"," All right. "
"4197110","4202130"," I just sent you a picture of a chart I got here on your Twitter DM."
"4202710","4202850"," Okay."
"4203630","4207770"," I think tight here will be download this really quick. "
"4217430","4218610"," One quick second."
"4218850","4219870"," I'll bring this one up next."
"4228040","4229760"," This is so odd. "
"4229760","4230680"," Hold on one second here."
"4237260","4239940"," Having some formatting issues from."
"4241780","4242820"," Hold on to do this again. "
"4251470","4252590"," Where's our right Bradley?"
"4253070","4253670"," I see you."
"4254090","4254410"," I'm sorry."
"4254730","4256070"," I did not see that earlier. "
"4256310","4257630"," Let me pull that up."
"4258310","4259090"," The apple."
"4260250","4266110"," It's call wall is at 187.5. It's put wall is at 180. "
"4267430","4270850"," Next expiry call volume is 44% and next."
"4272390","4274750"," Put volume is 45%."
"4275930","4276610"," All right. "
"4276970","4277150"," Yeah."
"4277330","4277450"," Okay."
"4277550","4279650"," So this is a really naive tool that's on screen right now. "
"4279670","4279930"," I want to."
"4280770","4283810"," I use, I use this tool in stock charts all the time."
"4284370","4285010"," Oh, you do?"
"4285370","4285430"," Yeah. "
"4285570","4287270"," Actually, so this is like I create."
"4288170","4288650"," Yeah."
"4288970","4288990"," Similar. "
"4289230","4295510"," So what it is, what I do is I take 101 year 101 day look back."
"4296130","4296410"," Right."
"4296410","4300870"," And the black line is an index it to 100. "
"4301750","4306830"," And so the black line is the current price action over the last 100 and one days."
"4307510","4308110"," Including today."
"4308710","4312990"," And what you see what I do is I go back to 1940. "
"4313690","4315630"," And I look for."
"4316470","4320150"," I look for all series time series."
"4320990","4322770"," That are 101 days long. "
"4322770","4325250"," That have that are highly correlated."
"4325510","4328610"," So the correlation cut off that I have is point 93, which would."
"4328930","4330510"," Which is considered pretty high correlation. "
"4331250","4334010"," But then it generates a whole bunch of."
"4334530","4338210"," You know, time series that correlate with this."
"4338310","4343970"," But then what I do is I will I run what's called a Granger causality test. "
"4344650","4349570"," Granger won the Nobel prize in economics for his work on time series data."
"4349570","4353910"," He came up with this wonderful test, which you can take one time series."
"4354670","4359890"," And compare it to another time series and say if time series a predicts time series B."
"4360330","4362830"," With any sort of statistical significance. "
"4363790","4364010"," Right."
"4364630","4368130"," So what it then does is it spits out."
"4368610","4370450"," Well, after I run this says it spits off. "
"4371210","4372950"," A bunch of them that pass."
"4373710","4378190"," At, you know, at 0.05 level, but I run."
"4379450","4381630"," This with a very tight threshold. "
"4382130","4389390"," My P value that I look for is less than 0.00001, which means that these series."
"4389830","4393050"," Are in one in 1000 chance of predict."
"4393350","4397650"," These out of all the series, these series have a one in 1000 chance. "
"4397770","4400370"," Of predicting and these are these are correct."
"4400890","4405050"," So what you see here and the way I read this chart, the black line."
"4405670","4406330"," Is now. "
"4406730","4411310"," And if you look at the historical chart, you see like there's a whole bunch of correlations."
"4411690","4412830"," Look at that green line."
"4413230","4414790"," 0.95 correlation. "
"4415670","4416090"," Right."
"4416530","4419730"," And it kind of like grinds up and then we kind of get a little dip."
"4420510","4423430"," And then it continues to grind up into the end of the year. "
"4425270","4434150"," Now, conversely, look at the brown line, which is almost 0.95. And we're and that kind of just, you"
"4434150","4435890"," know, chalk trade, chalk trade down."
"4436370","4437450"," Into the end of the year."
"4438470","4439610"," Now these are trading days. "
"4439930","4441290"," So this is not calendar days."
"4441450","4442230"," This is trading days."
"4442810","4446570"," And if you believe like I do that, no matter what happens. "
"4446970","4451410"," Human nature and human psychology remains constant over time."
"4451910","4452390"," Despite."
"4453870","4458550"," All the new products, equities, you know, options that are available. "
"4459150","4460970"," Price action should remain similar."
"4461690","4466530"," This is a really cool chart to seeing what are the possible outcomes in the market."
"4466990","4467770"," That we could follow. "
"4468610","4471310"," And right now, I don't have a call to make."
"4471530","4475110"," And this is why I said we are cautiously optimistic of us going up."
"4475670","4480190"," But I'm also cognizant of the fact that we could go down because right where we are. "
"4480190","4483050"," We are at an inflection point into tomorrow."
"4483690","4487590"," So either we start the grind up or we start to chop down."
"4489310","4492870"," Yeah, that's fascinating to see right here that this is that one out, come up here. "
"4493030","4494150"," And then we have this other up."
"4494670","4499950"," You have a pretty pretty quick or pretty thick and clear all this stuff here."
"4500050","4505310"," So we have a pretty clear delineation here, right of like a move up. "
"4505310","4508430"," And then we've got this move here to the downside here."
"4508430","4509970"," It's a little bit of an action here."
"4510090","4512190"," The sideways grind up into the end of the year. "
"4512270","4513730"," We also know the elections are coming."
"4514210","4517930"," But I see what you're saying at this inflection point is almost clear as day, right?"
"4518470","4520550"," Or at least where we start to get right in here."
"4520630","4525270"," We start to get a decision on market direction for the year. "
"4525870","4530830"," You know, what else would be fascinating here would be to maybe bring on David AMS at some point to"
"4530830","4531490"," look at this chart."
"4532290","4538910"," As he tracks the same stuff going back multiple years trying to find out where that manipulation"
"4538910","4539850"," takes place."
"4540390","4543990"," And this is likely that we're coming into that moment right of that manipulation. "
"4545430","4549610"," You guys know how you look at a chart on a weekly basis or a one week basis."
"4550250","4551350"," Look at a five day chart."
"4552070","4557190"," And you guys hear about all the time about turn around Tuesday manipulation Wednesday. "
"4557530","4559350"," What the fuck Wednesday you'll hear."
"4560070","4565130"," And then you'll see monetization on Thursday and then we sell out on the trade for a weekly trade."
"4565650","4569370"," You can do that on a monthly basis, a three month basis, a one year basis. "
"4570470","4572750"," And it all correlates on every time frame."
"4573010","4576670"," So it doesn't matter if you're looking at a year chart, three year chart, five year chart, a one"
"4576670","4578730"," week chart, even an intraday chart."
"4580090","4585870"," As a matter of fact, this morning, David AMS spoke about sweeps up on high this morning in the"
"4585870","4587150"," marketplace and pre market. "
"4587150","4589870"," And this is a similar concept."
"4590370","4594130"," If you're trying to grasp what this means on a yearly basis."
"4595010","4597390"," I could continue to try to podcast where else you got brother. "
"4598570","4604210"," Well, these are the these are some of the tricks in my bag that I have right now that I'm"
"4604210","4604710"," willing to."
"4605130","4607170"," Yeah, comfortable with sharing."
"4607570","4613150"," You're in the you're coming on board for the trade trade trigger network. "
"4613190","4614070"," Aren't you the."
"4615310","4620990"," Supposedly, I was I mean, it's talking to trader podcast in the background and we can get him on"
"4620990","4621550"," board here."
"4622970","4626070"," More frequently, but even if it's in written form or something like that. "
"4627090","4627530"," Right."
"4627670","4627770"," Right."
"4628030","4628030"," Yeah. "
"4628210","4631770"," No, that'd be happy to, as I said, I'd be happy to contribute to the platform."
"4632150","4633810"," I think it's it's."
"4635030","4637770"," It's important for people to understand one thing though. "
"4637810","4639050"," It is good to get information."
"4639590","4642030"," It's good to look at information, but the trade is yours."
"4642030","4643030"," That's right. "
"4643030","4644510"," The trade is yours."
"4644850","4649750"," You make it your own when you press that by trigger or when you press that cell trigger."
"4650470","4654530"," It is your own and these are some of the tools like I look at. "
"4655230","4659170"," Like, for example, like I personally miss the trigger a lot."
"4659730","4661990"," I have cobbled together something for myself."
"4670210","4671170"," Oh, dude. "
"4671170","4674050"," TV right now in DMS. I'll get it to you right now."
"4674250","4674430"," Done. "
"4675390","4675970"," All right."
"4676210","4677630"," Let me let me send that over."
"4678630","4679310"," Done, dude. "
"4679990","4680830"," Do it right now for you."
"4684190","4684590"," Gotcha."
"4685350","4685750"," Done. "
"4686070","4686130"," Yeah."
"4686590","4686710"," Yeah."
"4687030","4687310"," Thank you. "
"4687490","4688150"," I appreciate that."
"4688250","4691590"," I personally love the trigger because you know what?"
"4691770","4692690"," I have a script too."
"4692850","4695070"," Let me let me share that and I'll be. "
"4696710","4698350"," It's kind of private right now."
"4698410","4700430"," So people talk about it a bit."
"4700570","4700810"," Yeah. "
"4700810","4700910"," Yeah."
"4701990","4702690"," But anyways."
"4704550","4705470"," We'll come back to it. "
"4705870","4706230"," Yeah."
"4708270","4710030"," I don't know if there's any other questions."
"4710310","4710770"," I'm happy to. "
"4710950","4711050"," Yeah."
"4711150","4712430"," If you guys have any questions right now."
"4713890","4714830"," You guys want to. "
"4716330","4720330"," I'm really first of all, thank you for coming on and spending your time with us."
"4720410","4721630"," You know, we always appreciate that."
"4722050","4727650"," And I have been talking to trader podcast in the background for last month or two, trying to get"
"4727650","4730270"," him on board to join us on the team. "
"4730950","4736270"," And there's a bunch of other guys out there that some heavy hitters out there that are supposed to"
"4736270","4742530"," get to join the trade trigger network and give them a place to for you to interact with them."
"4742530","4745390"," And maybe you guys like being on Wall Street."
"4745390","4746970"," So then you like to go to Twitter for this. "
"4746990","4748590"," You like to go to YouTube every night and watch video."
"4749210","4753490"," And then you can hook up with retail traders and find out what they're thinking."
"4753490","4757510"," You know, I don't want to call it safe space, but a place for them to lay out some of"
"4757510","4763990"," their stuff and that they can do it without getting torn to pieces or shit on or any of that"
"4763990","4764470"," kind of stuff. "
"4764670","4764810"," So."
"4765810","4767250"," Trade podcast is in."
"4767970","4770410"," We're working with them right now hoping to get them on board here. "
"4770550","4772070"," You guys, everything you want to say to get a podcast?"
"4773290","4774170"," What do you guys got?"
"4777300","4779800"," Matter of fact, let me get you his handle right now really quick."
"4781380","4784720"," And I'll get you his exact handle and you can follow him."
"4785220","4786840"," He's got 7,000 followers. "
"4787080","4789020"," It's criminal that he doesn't have any more followers."
"4789680","4794640"," And I'm sure he'll follow you back to he's not that he's a he's like he's a regular guy just"
"4794640","4795220"," like you and I."
"4795420","4797320"," So here's his Twitter handle right here."
"4801390","4803010"," He always lends good insight. "
"4803190","4804130"," He always that lends him."
"4804310","4806190"," I want to say something about trader podcast."
"4806770","4812670"," And I don't know if you know this trader podcast, but I appreciate why follow him closely because"
"4812670","4816050"," when someone says something on to it. "
"4816050","4823450"," I always noticed that trader podcast is always there trying to lend to the conversation whether he"
"4823450","4824990"," agrees or disagrees is irrelevant."
"4825610","4827870"," But he's there trying to be constructive."
"4828450","4832550"," And so if you follow him on fin to it, you're going to see how he weaves his way in"
"4832550","4838270"," and around some heavy hitters out there and trying to enrich the conversation that's going on. "
"4838270","4841030"," So do yourself a solid follow him trader podcast."
"4841350","4844770"," I just just posted his handle in the stream."
"4845910","4846390"," Thanks. "
"4846650","4847350"," I appreciate."
"4847690","4850170"," I appreciate the support man."
"4850350","4850950"," It's a great quality. "
"4850950","4853630"," And your crew there like vault signals is amazing."
"4853630","4854470"," I like him."
"4855010","4856710"," A whole bunch of the guys that you run around with. "
"4856850","4857450"," I think are amazing."
"4857870","4863810"," So yeah, it's so for me like there was a big fundamental shift in the way I started looking at"
"4863810","4865330"," the markets in the last couple of years."
"4865330","4870330"," And I moved away from fundamentals. "
"4870890","4870950"," Yep."
"4872950","4876630"," Because yeah, I just moved away from that."
"4877030","4879570"," I did a lot more use a lot more TA. "
"4880410","4884310"," And then, you know, I have a statistics background."
"4885310","4886090"," I enjoy statistics."
"4886350","4887510"," I'm one of those nerds that does. "
"4887510","4895310"," Tell about the idea behind how statistics and probabilities can really help you in the cash market"
"4895310","4895990"," as a retail trader."
"4896450","4900270"," Well, yeah, because so the way I look at it stock markets."
"4900930","4903610"," I'm sorry, like I have cleaners in the house right now. "
"4903930","4905110"," The cleanings that you hear of acting."
"4905110","4905970"," I'm so sorry."
"4909410","4912150"," So probabilities and statistics. "
"4912150","4914510"," I'll help you understand the world around you."
"4914710","4919330"," Like, you know, it helps you become a little bit more intelligent towards reading the newspaper."
"4919650","4924670"," It helps you become a little bit better at gambling and stock market is gambling than there is. "
"4925110","4929850"," So places where people make fun of probably in statistics, right?"
"4929850","4932050"," Or they say that they don't matter."
"4932290","4933270"," They're not applicable."
"4933790","4939230"," But you just said the stock market is a place where it can treat you probably in statistics. "
"4939830","4942150"," Statistics can treat you very well."
"4942830","4945090"," If you're this is an environment like baseball, right?"
"4945150","4948830"," If you're batting a 300, you can make it in the Hall of Fame, right?"
"4949030","4953090"," And the stock market can do some of the same stuff for you, too, if you train appropriately to"
"4953090","4953510"," that, right?"
"4953710","4955470"," You're like, I'm looking for a 300% banger."
"4956410","4957870"," And I only hit that three out of 10 times. "
"4958070","4959070"," You're going to do quite well, right?"
"4959070","4959690"," Right."
"4959830","4965850"," Renaissance does exactly that their percentage is 51% of successful trades, but their profitability"
"4965850","4967150"," factor is over 10."
"4968070","4974270"," So, you know, they're better than a coin flip, but each of the trades is extremely asymmetric. "
"4974610","4979190"," So it ends up paying them quite a bit like each of those, the ones that like hit."
"4980430","4986690"," Instead of running at 10 trades and making 30% on 10 trades, losing one in the air buy in"
"4986690","4990550"," is probably, you guys know what I'm talking about, likely, but that's running the wheel strategy."
"4992170","4994970"," You get that one heavy loss and you're out of pocket. "
"4995210","4997630"," That's plus your taxes and the cost of the trade."
"4998330","5002270"," And you're kind of up on the year, like 10, 15%, 30%, something like that."
"5002450","5010150"," But just that one hit is a major hit to you out of those trades where if you bang three"
"5010150","5019350"," or five out of the park out of 10, then you're looking at asymmetric like 300% banger, 500%"
"5019350","5020730"," banger, 1000% banger. "
"5021810","5023470"," You're going to beat it all day long, right?"
"5024050","5024430"," Right."
"5024670","5024750"," Right."
"5025210","5025210"," Exactly. "
"5025930","5027990"," And so be harder."
"5027990","5028930"," Your question."
"5032730","5036830"," This is not a zero DTE strategy for topics. "
"5037570","5040270"," So that is, that will play out into next week."
"5040870","5044290"," So I would give myself three times as much time."
"5044290","5048090"," So a month out is ideally what I would say, you know. "
"5048770","5050070"," Were you speaking to right now?"
"5051150","5054070"," Be harder 12 on Twitch."
"5055830","5061930"," Says his expiry strategy, take a week out or to be used tomorrow's zero date."
"5062170","5064090"," You're saying not zero dates, right?"
"5064590","5065510"," Yeah, not zero dates. "
"5065790","5067850"," This is this takes time to play out, right?"
"5068110","5069230"," Yeah, it takes time to play out."
"5069270","5073490"," And also you've got the dealer, usually on, especially on events like ER, you've got dealers that"
"5073490","5074970"," will wipe the boards first, right?"
"5076370","5080610"," And paint on until that until that first expiry is done."
"5080890","5089250"," So if you're trading an individual ticker on ER, you already know there's a run up phase, right?"
"5089470","5091470"," People are either selling it down or they're buying it up. "
"5092270","5095690"," Then you've got the event phase part part of the part of that trade."
"5095790","5096750"," That's the event."
"5096750","5101970"," Sometimes we will blast up or down and dealers are forced to chase that move. "
"5102150","5102630"," It's that quick."
"5102630","5109130"," But generally speaking, you'll get top and bottom side expected move tag and then they crush that"
"5109130","5111990"," next expiry and then the real trade happens after."
"5112230","5113210"," Does that sound right or no?"
"5113910","5121030"," Yeah, no, that's kind of how it depends, you know, it depends on how much stuff is in the money"
"5121030","5124010"," that's getting rolled out or getting assigned. "
"5125090","5130730"," And so the dealers can like, if it's like, they got to remember like in December, like the December"
"5130730","5136450"," off text and video got taken to the cleaners, just because there was just so much call gamma that"
"5136450","5142710"," expired and in video that complex I had tweeted about it, like leading up to the December off text."
"5143410","5145270"," And, you know, it was around the 500."
"5145770","5150550"," It was from like from like 450 to like 525. "
"5151470","5156350"," So you're also positing that doesn't matter what the news is and some of these stickers."
"5158170","5165270"," That roll off the money call gamma is going to or it's going to still force price down right or"
"5165270","5165530"," up."
"5166770","5171130"," It's going to force price down for the most part because it's like the ones I shared, they're"
"5171130","5172310"," mostly call heavy. "
"5173490","5177230"," Yeah, or put heavy in the money."
"5177350","5182910"," Yeah, so like, for example, one of the other people just asked, did I talk about GME?"
"5183070","5184050"," I pulled up GME."
"5184450","5186130"," GME's call wall is at 16. "
"5186510","5187730"," It's put wall is at 15."
"5189110","5193690"," And it's next expiry call volume is 32 and a half percent."
"5194050","5199470"," But the next expiry put volume is 47%. "
"5199470","5202610"," So that's a put heavy expiry."
"5202890","5204350"," What what expiry is that?"
"5204430","5205870"," If you buy my asking, you're going to go look it up."
"5208050","5211570"," It's it's the one that's coming up tomorrow off X."
"5214150","5216710"," So they've got a huge puts rolling off tomorrow. "
"5217430","5222110"," They've got huge puts doesn't mean that they can't get rolled into like more deeper Hindu money"
"5222110","5224470"," puts or or more out of the money puts."
"5224470","5226670"," Wow, this is a nice bloodbath."
"5226850","5228910"," We've got going on Vix is sorry. "
"5229530","5232490"," The Dixie is on a rampage right now."
"5232990","5235670"," The meeting take a look here."
"5236610","5239110"," Tesla rolling down even harder right now. "
"5239150","5240910"," Tesla not liking this at all."
"5241350","5245830"," No, Tesla's kind of given up everything from pre market."
"5247810","5254230"," I'll buy in the one sixty one ninety five's and one sixties is where I plan on buying Tesla. "
"5256190","5257530"," This is not the time."
"5258590","5259770"," Let me take a look here."
"5260290","5267330"," Having some lagging Tesla now trading to 10. "
"5272270","5273890"," Now is a quick roll down."
"5274110","5275270"," I'm not too concerned here."
"5275410","5281990"," There's I'm on a one minute chart on NASDAQ looking for a trade back to 16 eight fifty five. "
"5283930","5286790"," We also have a cross coming up right now on SPX."
"5288150","5291750"," You can see the five minute triggers crossing the hourly trigger right now."
"5292490","5293950"," I'm going to have to buy this actually. "
"5294730","5301410"," Yeah, you have the cross taking place right now on the half hour and hourly trigger on the spot."
"5302010","5305510"," You guys see the cross happening down here."
"5308210","5309550"," Yeah, it's a higher low. "
"5310730","5312450"," There you go."
"5312450","5312790"," Nice call."
"5313530","5315810"," I'm still not bearish here at all. "
"5318910","5323650"," Now, and then the thing, the only thing is that one o'clock in two hours, we've got a 10"
"5323650","5324690"," year auction."
"5325090","5326050"," Yeah, we have a 10 year coming up."
"5326270","5328370"," So right there, you see the cross taking place down here. "
"5329070","5333970"," Yeah, and the 10 year auction is also only 18 billion in treasuries."
"5334150","5336570"," What's really important also towards the end of the month."
"5337290","5341230"," To think about guys is we get the QRA announcement. "
"5341750","5342430"," It's right."
"5343750","5353450"," And that kind of feeds into like my February 14th market pop because of election"
"5353450","5353970"," season."
"5353970","5360330"," I honestly don't think that Janet Yellen is going to go heavy coupons again. "
"5360490","5362130"," She's going to do the same twist she did."
"5363710","5371230"," Yeah, if she reduces the coupon issuance, the equity market and the bond market should rip like"
"5371230","5372210"," parabolic, right?"
"5373750","5375790"," Yeah, if she reduces coupon it."
"5376010","5376810"," That's what you're looking for. "
"5376870","5380370"," If you guys are out there right now, so who was asking who was asking about that the other day?"
"5380830","5381550"," Was it."
"5383090","5387090"," See here, who was asking about this earlier in the week was."
"5388110","5394120"," What 20 you guys was asking about this earlier in the week. "
"5394900","5396960"," Someone on YouTube was asking about it."
"5398740","5400060"," Earlier in the week, so."
"5400700","5403840"," Let me see who was that because I thought he was here earlier. "
"5405060","5408140"," I think it was Camille that was asking about it earlier in the week."
"5408720","5410120"," So Camille, you're basically looking."
"5410540","5413660"," You want to see if you want to see it now, this doesn't. "
"5413960","5415060"," I want to say something clear here."
"5416320","5419920"," If you've got the stock market that's expected."
"5421420","5425680"," Let's see come up here right have a March low come up here for summer run come back down for"
"5425680","5426320"," September low. "
"5426800","5427780"," And then up here."
"5429180","5434760"," This thesis would be like the blast down right that's like great cuts that kind of stuff."
"5435320","5437000"," A market event something like that. "
"5437240","5440100"," We don't know about front running rate cuts something like that."
"5440260","5440780"," Whatever that is."
"5440920","5442020"," Okay, that's that downside move. "
"5443740","5450860"," This QRA announcement would mean something more like this like violence to the upside."
"5451360","5456160"," Maybe some large pullbacks of course mixed in, but it's not this nice slope."
"5456180","5458420"," It's not this downside, but something like this. "
"5458940","5461500"," And that would only be if I write this down at home."
"5462340","5464500"," If you're looking forward to this now."
"5464860","5469160"," Did I Marcus made a point that it coincides with a bunch of tech earnings to. "
"5470880","5477500"," But you are looking for yelling yelling Jenny Ellen to reduce coupon issuance."
"5478560","5480680"," That's that's like the line right there."
"5480680","5483960"," If you're looking for that parabolic move now we'll say something. "
"5484380","5487920"," If there's only like a five to 15% chance of that happening."
"5488420","5491300"," It's not really a there's not really a large chance of that happening."
"5491940","5498120"," But it is there because if they if they did this right and they proceeded to make cuts. "
"5498120","5503200"," You would not see the role in the stock the roll over in the stock market that's anticipated."
"5504020","5509780"," Once they do begin to make cuts with unemployment rising and inflation are bouncing off 2% and"
"5509780","5510840"," going straight vertical."
"5511300","5514160"," That whole thesis would be washed away. "
"5515260","5520160"," If that does happen on the point is it 31st trader podcast or is it."
"5520500","5521520"," We don't know."
"5521660","5524300"," I think it's going to be the 30th of the 31st. "
"5524480","5524680"," Okay."
"5524960","5525620"," Somewhere in there, right?"
"5525620","5526160"," Yeah."
"5526280","5526380"," Yeah. "
"5526580","5529520"," I didn't know the exact date, but it's somewhere in there and we'll know."
"5529880","5532120"," And if it's like more more."
"5532760","5534140"," Shorter dated treasuries. "
"5534700","5536580"," So that would be that's what's called a twist."
"5536860","5538020"," If they do that."
"5538700","5543500"," We have the market is going to like it's going to essentially be a loosening of financial"
"5543500","5544080"," conditions. "
"5544240","5546500"," You're going to see mortgage rates start to drop."
"5547240","5549720"," And you're going to see the market just take off."
"5549720","5552980"," So do that before they make cuts. "
"5553700","5554960"," And we know about it."
"5555940","5559880"," No, so the thing is it takes away the the cut."
"5559900","5561460"," It takes away the march completely. "
"5562300","5564560"," And then because the thing is."
"5565020","5567240"," So there's two competing artists, right?"
"5569700","5576320"," Does Jerome Powell do the cut in March to basically be like, I am not beholden to Biden."
"5577540","5581360"," Because if he does it later, if he does it later, it's going to be like, Oh, this is political"
"5581360","5581780"," pressure. "
"5582080","5582400"," That's right."
"5582460","5584900"," But if he does it right now, it's not political pressure."
"5584960","5586520"," It's because the time is appropriate. "
"5587460","5589440"," Now, so that's one narrative, right?"
"5589660","5591500"," Like that we get the rate cut in March."
"5592380","5594400"," For why we would get a rate cut in March."
"5594960","5599240"," Now, the other narrative is financial conditions remain good. "
"5599500","5601000"," We are seeing inflation go down."
"5601180","5602580"," We don't need to do a cut right now."
"5602580","5609340"," And that would only happen if there is a somewhat loosening of financial conditions by this. "
"5609940","5612240"," If we don't get."
"5613020","5614700"," A twist in the Q."
"5614880","5619700"," And it comes out 60, 40, like it usually is supposed to."
"5621620","5626140"," Then in my opinion, what we see is. "
"5627680","5631840"," The owners on the Fed to cut rates in March."
"5632480","5635940"," So either way, I think the anticipation starts to come in."
"5637440","5639280"," Keep an eye on the. "
"5639740","5642220"," Do you notice that it has a bad much of a topic of conversation?"
"5642980","5644120"," Like I haven't seen."
"5644580","5650180"," I've only seen two, three real discussions going on in this Q.R. I haven't seen many people"
"5650180","5650940"," speaking about it."
"5651560","5655340"," Yeah, people are hedging their, you know, watching what they say. "
"5655560","5658440"," They don't want to be off sides on this, right?"
"5658700","5659840"," And the other thing is also."
"5660300","5667520"," That's a key point, too, is that I think Jedi was making yesterday, not that you can't short it."
"5667680","5669160"," Just I wouldn't be shorting it. "
"5669220","5671880"," I'd probably be sitting on my hands until that data comes out, right?"
"5672300","5672620"," Right."
"5672940","5673600"," Like that's the thing."
"5673680","5678040"," And then the thing is it's going to be such a crowded trade so quickly. "
"5678040","5681380"," Because everybody's going to short yields."
"5682100","5688180"," If you get the bullish Q.R.A. from Janet Yellen, where it's mostly just short data treasuries."
"5688900","5693280"," Because, you know, as a country, we can absorb short dated. "
"5695620","5696500"," Um, issuances."
"5696960","5704300"," We, you know, absorbing 30 year at 5% is a lot harder than absorbing 5% at 6 months."
"5704980","5709900"," You know, so that's, that's kind of like, like, that's my thinking. "
"5710260","5717720"," As I said, like, I, I like to think of myself as somebody who's not smart as Michael Berry."
"5718340","5723260"," So I find a lot of, so I find a lot of."
"5723260","5724460"," It doesn't matter. "
"5724720","5731340"," I just find it myself to be in a much happier mental position when I'm buying the dip."
"5732200","5733520"," Then I'm trying to short a towel."
"5734520","5737240"," You know, Joe, I were talking about that yesterday. "
"5737660","5740560"," That's how hard difficult that it can be for."
"5743020","5745220"," Timing selling rather than buying."
"5745520","5751020"," I mean, I guess it's not so bad on an inch day basis, but generally speaking, it's easier to be"
"5751020","5752980"," a by the dipper, right?"
"5757660","5764400"," Um, yeah, I mean, I just, there's a survivorship bias in the market. "
"5764740","5765880"," Let's talk about that."
"5766060","5768060"," You can just say anything anytime you want."
"5768260","5768340"," So. "
"5768960","5772500"," Yeah, so there's a, there's a survivorship bias in the market."
"5773440","5777080"," Non-performing assets are removed from the S&P 500."
"5777080","5779840"," And performing assets are broadened. "
"5780260","5781560"," That's why the market always goes up."
"5783740","5788000"," And it's really important as an investor as an, as a trader."
"5790460","5792560"," To think about it in that way. "
"5792820","5797400"," Yes, we might go 10 years sideways, but the market goes up."
"5798060","5802280"," You know, you have to find other strategies to generate alpha."
"5803520","5809540"," And whether it be stock picking, whether it be call over writing or put underwriting, you know, you"
"5809540","5811880"," can generate alpha, like multiple ways. "
"5812200","5814080"," And it's up to you to do that."
"5814300","5816020"," But in general, the market goes up."
"5816560","5820140"," I mean, just zoom out and look up and to the right. "
"5820500","5823160"," I think when you like to talk about that too, sometimes."
"5825800","5827780"," Or as well, I should say."
"5828060","5828060"," Yeah. "
"5828340","5828580"," Yeah."
"5828760","5833460"," So it's, it's, to me, like, it's a lot easier being a dumb bull buying the dip."
"5834180","5837760"," Because it pays off a lot more than timing the top. "
"5838580","5843880"," And putting enough leverage into it to pay off because we don't go down in a straight line."
"5844280","5847780"," We can go up in a straight line, but we don't go down in a straight line."
"5847980","5852480"," That's, that's, we had that exact conversation yesterday with our Joe had that exact conversation"
"5852480","5855980"," with us yesterday on a phone call. "
"5855980","5862580"," This exact conversation about difficulty about being a bear in a bowl and then this and tied into"
"5862580","5863720"," what you're saying right here."
"5865040","5865520"," Right."
"5865680","5870720"," Like, even if you, the screenshot that I sent you, right, you see the brown line, right?"
"5870980","5871980"," It goes down. "
"5872540","5875140"," Put it like chops up and goes down."
"5875480","5880020"," So if you are, like, you know, doing a state, a straight Vega trade."
"5880800","5884100"," Or you're doing a, so look at the brown line. "
"5884340","5885840"," It does not go down in a straight line."
"5885960","5886660"," It's going down."
"5886860","5887860"," It goes down significantly. "
"5889520","5894060"," But well, and there's a saving grace down here, too, that eventually comes back up again, right?"
"5894060","5895420"," You're wrong."
"5896720","5898700"," And you're just DCing down here."
"5898820","5905340"," You're still going to, I always like watching people say, like, the SP 500 is under performed for. "
"5905820","5910420"," They always see people say things like, if you had bought the SP 500 and hold of 10 years, it"
"5910420","5912100"," didn't produce shit for you."
"5912220","5914520"," But what they don't tell you is the compounding dividends."
"5915840","5921820"," What that pays over, over 10 years, it outperforms most of the market, right?"
"5922820","5923260"," Right. "
"5923260","5925580"," I see your comment, Ritra Mantra."
"5925840","5927600"," And, you know, it is a good point."
"5928020","5930400"," It went down straight for two weeks, but then what happened?"
"5931760","5933720"," That's my counter to your argument. "
"5934020","5934140"," Yeah."
"5934420","5935440"," But then what happened?"
"5935860","5940740"," And we were, so we were, we had this exact conversation yesterday, Joe and I, right?"
"5940900","5947460"," And I was like, the worst part is on this is if you're looking at 10 trades or 100 trades."
"5949040","5953820"," So if the safest one is going to be just buying the S&P 500 on a dip, on a"
"5953820","5954720"," major dip, right?"
"5955180","5957920"," Even if it goes down for six months a year or whatever, right?"
"5958180","5959920"," And you don't think it's something a little bit more risky. "
"5960660","5965880"," And you're like, you hear people out there say, well, if you just buy these zero dates every day on"
"5965880","5972120"," an SPY or Q's and over a hundred trades or a thousand trades, you're still going to be a winner."
"5972120","5978800"," There's even safer ways, but that can give you a higher wins, right?"
"5979140","5983400"," Spreads, like spreads, like any major dip in the S&P 500 of the Q's."
"5983480","5987020"," If you were to buy a call for it with enough time on them, especially in oversold conditions,"
"5988080","5992400"," you're pretty much a guaranteed winner nine out of 10 times. "
"5993460","5996720"," Twenty, twenty eight out of 30 times."
"5998020","5999380"," Let's talk about that really quick."
"5999800","6000960"," Let's see if I can bring this up. "
"6001640","6004100"," Explain or you keep talking trade, pop back pass."
"6004240","6005880"," I'm going to bring something up for these guys to see."
"6008100","6008500"," Gotcha. "
"6008500","6009160"," So, yeah."
"6010900","6011940"," That's great retro mantra."
"6012340","6013320"," I'm glad you took that short. "
"6013520","6014720"," I'm glad it paid out for you."
"6015220","6021000"," So let's talk about cycles maybe."
"6021220","6022020"," Let me see if this is it. "
"6024750","6033610"," By the way, I also want to say cap and I before December quarterly op X him and I were"
"6033610","6034330"," on a phone call."
"6035470","6039490"," And I said that the caller is going to get blown this time."
"6039950","6042910"," And, and I just want to say this cap, I was right. "
"6043530","6044770"," The caller got blown last quarter."
"6045210","6047390"," Oh, yeah, totally, dude."
"6047570","6047850"," Totally. "
"6049070","6051430"," Totally got popped, which is rare, right?"
"6051610","6052130"," We know it's not."
"6052130","6054330"," It's what it's one in 17 times."
"6054330","6054730"," It's happened. "
"6055090","6055930"," It's not."
"6055970","6057410"," It's not common, dude."
"6058050","6064610"," Yeah, but, but all the other positioning like was screaming at me at that time that we are not"
"6064610","6067630"," going down to 45 15. "
"6067930","6069210"," There was too much support."
"6069370","6075550"," There was too much call gamma sticky call gamma sitting there, which would just allow for me to"
"6075550","6076950"," version on a longer time frame."
"6076950","6080710"," But anyways, I don't think that's going to happen this time. "
"6080830","6082250"," So I think we're range bound this quarter."
"6082450","6084790"," So this is going to be a rough quarter."
"6085290","6087030"," We're going to talk about something quickly here. "
"6087670","6092150"," Some larger timeframe with trader podcast is talking about."
"6092310","6092390"," Okay."
"6093570","6098300"," So I want you all to know out there. "
"6098560","6101880"," Now, this doesn't mean you shouldn't be a feel more comfortable shorting."
"6101920","6103540"," You feel more comfortable selling the market."
"6103540","6104380"," I understand that. "
"6104860","6110360"," If you have a high rate, wouldn't success rate on selling the market, then you should stay doing"
"6110360","6110700"," that, right?"
"6110880","6111620"," That works for you."
"6111820","6112420"," Stay doing that."
"6112760","6116200"," His point is that it's easier to be a by the dipper. "
"6116320","6117440"," Now, I want to show you guys some here."
"6117560","6121040"," This is when we had a, and this is in relation to what he's saying here."
"6122160","6124580"," Let me meet my camera real quick. "
"6125160","6126980"," Get rid of that web frame right there."
"6127860","6130060"," Now, and Dan Niles is a big time bear."
"6131140","6131680"," Okay. "
"6132680","6136120"," And he'll say things like he'll say things like right here."
"6136820","6138480"," He'll say the market's going to crash."
"6140080","6143000"," But I bought the oversold bounce down here. "
"6143560","6145340"," Now, this is market breadth."
"6145680","6145900"," Okay."
"6146460","6149800"," And I'm going to, this is an easy way to describe what we're talking about here. "
"6151000","6156380"," So I want you to see, I want you to see this topping action in breadth right here, right?"
"6156880","6160120"," But what you end up having is more squeezing action, right?"
"6160320","6165180"," Where this is rotation, believe it or not in other sectors before you actually get your roll down"
"6165180","6165940"," the road, right?"
"6166920","6173240"," So it's kind of hard to see where the top is unlike bottoms."
"6173460","6177880"," When you get down here and you get these bottoms, you tend to still have this upside almost"
"6177880","6178740"," immediate action."
"6179500","6181440"," Same thing down here, right?"
"6181600","6186420"," Same thing down here, same thing down here, same thing down here, right?"
"6186700","6192980"," So the idea being the idea behind this thesis is even if you're just just looking at market breadth"
"6192980","6194880"," from a market breadth perspective. "
"6195620","6203280"," And if you were to get into a market capitulation moment where we're at 21 30 to 21 over here,"
"6203320","6204480"," you see this total over here."
"6205200","6210060"," You have a capitulation phase that blasts us down."
"6210160","6211160"," Let me change the color over here. "
"6212780","6218600"," It's easier to time a dip by as we come down, you're like, oh God, this is terrible down here,"
"6218760","6218860"," right?"
"6219400","6221040"," We're blasting down, right?"
"6221160","6222180"," We have this one moment boom."
"6222700","6227060"," If you were to buy a call spread down here, you would have made money, even if we had continuation"
"6227060","6229020"," to the downside for a roll."
"6230120","6234420"," Even if you had this right here, whoop, all we up here, you'd already be selling out at that point"
"6234420","6236620"," from taking that dip by down below here. "
"6237300","6240080"," So this is where this is one of the trades that I run here."
"6240740","6248240"," Every time we have every time we're coming down inside of capitulation moments in the market on"
"6248240","6252120"," breadth, I will put on a call spread down here, right?"
"6252120","6254380"," Now, sometimes we'll continue higher afterwards."
"6254660","6256400"," I really don't care about that part of the trade. "
"6256520","6258520"," I care about just that one part right there."
"6258920","6264680"," If I run that trade here, run that trade again, right down here, run this trade one more time, I"
"6264680","6269860"," could have survived the entire pullback in 2023 or 22."
"6271040","6272180"," I could have survived that. "
"6272280","6274300"," I didn't even have to sell this whole market down."
"6274460","6278860"," Didn't even have to get involved in any of this nasty down move that took place."
"6278860","6283500"," Now, what I've made more money in the downside, fuck yeah, but we're talking about win rates,"
"6283760","6283860"," right?"
"6284000","6289580"," I won, I won, I won, I won again, I won again, I won again, I won again, and I"
"6289580","6291300"," won again over here and again over here. "
"6292200","6294460"," So, this is the fascinating part."
"6294840","6299960"," The reason I'm saying this is what this call spread is, this is a good one right in here, right?"
"6299960","6306140"," So, you take that trade right there, so I'm boom, I'm long, and I'm out regardless if we go up"
"6306140","6307980"," or if we end up rolling above here."
"6308100","6310640"," It's not just that one part of that trade right there. "
"6311380","6315120"," An example here too would be, let's say I take the trade right here, right?"
"6315740","6316540"," We're squeezing up."
"6317280","6320680"," I take the money and run once my call spreads in the money."
"6320920","6321680"," Do I care about any of this?"
"6321860","6322780"," Nope, do I care about this?"
"6322780","6325300"," Nope, I care about this next one over here. "
"6325680","6326120"," Makes sense?"
"6326400","6327080"," So, I took that one."
"6327580","6330000"," People say, yeah, but you lost all this money over here, Captain."
"6330540","6336220"," But the truth is, if I only take six of these trades, ten of these trades a year, and they're"
"6336220","6339180"," all winners, I'm still beating you likely. "
"6339460","6345260"," You're still losing your money and day trading, you're trying to time quote unquote, you're trying"
"6345260","6348620"," to do this, you're trying to do that, you kind of got this right, you kind of got that wrong."
"6349120","6356620"," So trading less, only taking the money in that near sweet, the high probability trade, that 80%"
"6356620","6356900"," trade."
"6357280","6360300"," And if I put enough time in that trade, we continue down even more. "
"6360780","6362220"," I'm more than likely still going to print."
"6362500","6365520"," So maybe if I take that call spread, right?"
"6365660","6367420"," And I'm only looking for two or three hundred percent."
"6367420","6372760"," If I cost me a dollar, I want to run that trade for three bucks, and I'm going to exit"
"6372760","6375020"," that trade likely at $1.50 or two bucks. "
"6375460","6377240"," I don't need to stay in it for the full course."
"6377600","6379040"," I don't need it to go to a certain number."
"6379680","6382560"," And I'm only placing just that trade, just that one. "
"6382740","6387060"," And then I wait for the next, and I sit on my hands until the next time for that trade"
"6387060","6390500"," to come to me to make my money, right?"
"6390500","6396980"," Where I'm digging around doing, I'm digging around doing weeklies or monthlies or zero dates or any"
"6396980","6397700"," of that kind of stuff."
"6397940","6400100"," You have to find something like that for yourself."
"6400780","6407960"," If you're watching the show right now, you have to have some part of your investing trading life"
"6407960","6416520"," where you can reliably go back in time and say, I know this fucking trade works nine out of ten"
"6416520","6417080"," times. "
"6417680","6420580"," Now, I might only get that trade once a year."
"6420900","6422280"," I might only get it three times a year."
"6422560","6426820"," Whatever that trade is for you, you got to use that as your bread and butter. "
"6427140","6428960"," And I'm all in in that trade, right?"
"6429220","6433200"," Not only, but you know, I'm heavy fucking hitting on those trades or investments."
"6434460","6436900"," So you keep yourself always in this market."
"6436900","6438340"," You don't get blown out of this market. "
"6439060","6441340"," Hey, Cap, I need a couple of minutes."
"6441340","6442080"," I'll be right back."
"6442080","6443220"," Yeah, yeah, no worries, man. "
"6445320","6446260"," All right here."
"6448670","6454950"," Let's take a quick look at what you guys want to go back to that really quick."
"6455030","6456270"," I'm going to talk to you about this trade. "
"6456950","6458370"," I've used to discuss it often."
"6458410","6461450"," I used to discuss this trade often."
"6461890","6463470"," I don't do it as much as I used to. "
"6464430","6468590"," Now, some people, I'm not going to name names, Bill."
"6470790","6471930"," Jill Nutolo."
"6474070","6479610"," Some people, especially great traders, they go full in. "
"6480630","6482630"," They don't have to do a call spread like I do."
"6483310","6486930"," They're like zero day calls, weekly caught that they literally load up."
"6486930","6489730"," They're like, I bought some monthly calls, some weekly calls. "
"6490070","6495590"," I bought some three month calls, and then I zeroed in the fuck out of those capitulation moments in"
"6495590","6495990"," the market."
"6497190","6499410"," Now, we're going to look, you guys want to look again?"
"6499650","6500290"," I'll look again."
"6500530","6500870"," Hold on here. "
"6502810","6506550"," You want me to explain this trade better to you while our trader podcast is away?"
"6511510","6512230"," Where's cycles?"
"6512890","6512890"," Okay."
"6514070","6515090"," We'll bring up cycles."
"6515090","6519110"," So this is a cycle trade right here. "
"6519250","6519410"," Okay."
"6519950","6522210"," Now this uses market breadth."
"6522850","6528510"," This tool here is, I believe it's called the market breadth indicator by Iceman Rand. "
"6528990","6533430"," I don't know if I have that right or not, but you can get it on Fintuit or on trading"
"6533430","6533850"," view."
"6534570","6543370"," It's a heat map, basically, that shows the accumulation rate of sectors within the S&P 500."
"6543370","6553310"," And then distribution or rotation and then distribution inside of the different sectors in the S "
"6553310","6553870","&P 500. "
"6554350","6561130"," Now, if you're looking over here, there's actually inside of this inside of this"
"6561130","6568530"," indicator over here."
"6568530","6573230"," You can actually go inside of it and it describes to you what each one of these sectors are."
"6573390","6578210"," You see utilities right now is that 3.3. Let me say, let me make this larger here. "
"6580310","6590210"," So you can actually see right here, utilities are at 3.3, text at 40.6. This actually can tell"
"6590210","6594670"," you if tech is overbought or even oversold."
"6595850","6597830"," And you'll see the sector by sector."
"6598510","6601790"," And you can actually track where the rotation is as well. "
"6602510","6604470"," And then once the market comes, oh, hold on here."
"6609640","6612220"," Give me one quick second here, boys and girls."
"6623740","6627060"," When to time a trade based on breadth. "
"6627720","6632300"," So if you were to just track this right here, if you're just tracking this right here, there's two"
"6632300","6633540"," fascinating parts to this."
"6634040","6635720"," Or there's more fascinating parts to this too."
"6635720","6640660"," Are we getting acceleration to the downside while breadth is going lower?"
"6641900","6646780"," It actually implies that we're going to go up from here and not have a huge crash. "
"6647720","6652060"," If we have de or if we have acceleration of price to the downside."
"6653900","6656120"," Right before we get down here."
"6656920","6663120"," We would know that as this is coming down, we're likely going to see continued violence to the"
"6663120","6663520"," downside. "
"6663520","6667400"," If you see market breadth coming down and price is not following."
"6668060","6673760"," You tend to see limited downside before the next run to the upside."
"6673760","6674440"," Does that make sense?"
"6674700","6676240"," That's where we come down here. "
"6677040","6677340"," Right?"
"6677660","6682680"," We're at zero and you're not getting the violence to downside that you're anticipating."
"6683140","6685120"," As a matter of fact, that's it's right about there, right?"
"6685820","6686840"," And you get your next run."
"6687380","6693280"," Matter of fact, we can look at this right now on this right here. "
"6693280","6696100"," So just by looking at what we're looking at right now, right?"
"6697020","6698600"," Let me see if I can bring this up really quick."
"6701950","6702510"," Hold on here."
"6703990","6708850"," I'm getting a little walkiness going on here with a 30 minute chart. "
"6713460","6715680"," And let's just look at this right here, right?"
"6715820","6718940"," You've got this initial concentration back here."
"6719720","6719820"," Right?"
"6720840","6721240"," You got this."
"6721420","6723240"," This is what the bears want down here. "
"6723340","6726060"," They want to come down here and blast and clean all that up."
"6726060","6727840"," Are they going to get that or not?"
"6728240","6730220"," Breath is telling you probably not."
"6730740","6732720"," At least for this run right here, right?"
"6733360","6738960"," So if we switch over to the Webull chart right here, right?"
"6739200","6741220"," The question becomes how deep does it go?"
"6741800","6745700"," The bears want all of this erased down here. "
"6746840","6748380"," Are they going to get all of this?"
"6749660","6752480"," So far looking at breath, it's telling you no."
"6752820","6753920"," They're not going to get that."
"6753920","6759060"," But the most you're likely to see is this move down here before you get that nice next run. "
"6759700","6761420"," Does this all make sense to you?"
"6761540","6763620"," I'm going to show you this again one more time."
"6763840","6766080"," I'm going to show you this area right here, right?"
"6766260","6769680"," Now we're not seeing the acceleration to the downside that you're looking for."
"6770260","6775420"," And breath is almost at the bottom again. "
"6775820","6777820"," So let's look at the trigger screen."
"6778660","6782440"," And are we seeing the acceleration as breath goes down?"
"6782440","6784740"," Are we seeing the acceleration of the downside?"
"6785180","6787440"," No, you'd expect it to already be about here."
"6788180","6794220"," You'd expect price to already be there so that this last little leg would translate to boom down"
"6794220","6794500"," here. "
"6794500","6796160"," Clear all this out right here, right?"
"6798420","6804900"," So you just heard trader podcast saying I'm thinking that this bottom is not going to be as deep as"
"6804900","6805920"," other people are thinking."
"6805920","6813240"," And that's how you get your last move up before that correct corrective March bloodbath in here,"
"6813240","6813980"," right?"
"6814100","6817620"," So this run right here is likely to take place."
"6818280","6819400"," You want to know the date. "
"6819420","6824080"," It's January 30th to be exact January 30th."
"6824160","6826720"," You're going to expect to be buying a dip down here wherever that may be."
"6827080","6833240"," And we're positing that's probably here and right here and not down here. "
"6833240","6836900"," Possibly get down as far as right there to close that gap right there."
"6837400","6839540"," That's for 4450 somewhere in there."
"6840480","6844420"," But you'd likely also see breath bouncing around on zero. "
"6844880","6847540"," And how often does breath stay down there at zero?"
"6847900","6848920"," Not often at all doesn't."
"6849000","6849760"," It's like a V shape."
"6850640","6854980"," We get way more V shapes than we do on rotational tops. "
"6856660","6857320"," That's right."
"6863220","6870680"," And go back to a main screen here for everybody to pay attention here."
"6873300","6875480"," We got our three to the upside right here. "
"6876320","6879040"," One quick second here when I close that out."
"6881120","6883380"," And let me let me download these really quick."
"6884780","6885700"," What do we got here?"
"6885860","6886060"," You want the. "
"6888020","6889540"," What do you got here?"
"6889760","6890540"," You got a option."
"6890960","6893700"," Is this an option option chain here?"
"6893820","6894760"," You want that one first or no?"
"6895300","6897120"," So that's actually a fixed stripe matrix."
"6897440","6898640"," And yeah, let's put that on. "
"6898840","6899500"," The fixed stripe matrix."
"6899740","6900460"," And what's the next one?"
"6901180","6902560"," The other one is the term structure."
"6903760","6904160"," Okay. "
"6904200","6904660"," I see."
"6904800","6905680"," I see the term structure."
"6908840","6909240"," Here. "
"6919140","6922280"," I see a fixed term matrix and then we've got the term structure below it."
"6922820","6923200"," Right."
"6929170","6930570"," Let's bring this. "
"6932870","6933590"," Here."
"6933850","6934590"," Let's talk about that."
"6934590","6935690"," Yeah, let's switch over to a."
"6936510","6938030"," So they can see this. "
"6938530","6939710"," The numbers don't matter."
"6940050","6940410"," Okay."
"6940870","6941830"," The numbers don't matter. "
"6942230","6945710"," And so, so what this chart is showing."
"6946350","6949810"," Is the SPX fixed strike matrix."
"6950770","6954190"," Which means the this shows the IV. "
"6955850","6958450"," At every single strike."
"6958730","6962470"," That's close by within five minus five plus five percent."
"6962790","6966650"," So the screenshot that I'm showing the cap is showing right now for me. "
"6967010","6968570"," Is showing that now."
"6969830","6971210"," The narrative has been."
"6972050","6972570"," That. "
"6973490","6974090"," Yeah."
"6976110","6976710"," Exactly."
"6976750","6979550"," And this is actually reflected on this chart. "
"6979830","6980910"," By the way, this move cap."
"6980910","6982390"," I see it."
"6982390","6983170"," I see it right here. "
"6983650","6983950"," Yeah."
"6984390","6986550"," So red means that IV."
"6987310","6989050"," Sorry, volatility is well supplied. "
"6989490","6993850"," That means dealers are willing to sell options at a cheaper price than they have been."
"6994090","6995350"," The 60 day look back."
"6996070","7000350"," So wherever you see red, that means there's a lot of options. "
"7000650","7002030"," There's plenty of supply of options."
"7003090","7003470"," Right there."
"7004030","7006990"," And what you see green means that there is more. "
"7007950","7008810"," Put demand."
"7009390","7012270"," At these strikes and at these expirries."
"7014900","7016720"," Then dealers are willing to supply. "
"7017420","7019360"," So that's why IV over there."
"7019720","7020360"," Is rising."
"7020800","7023040"," And if you look at it, if you look at the dates. "
"7023800","7027280"," Those dates are the beginning of the month when the QRA is supposed to be."
"7027540","7027780"," Yep."
"7028200","7028380"," And then it's. "
"7028640","7035020"," They're February 1st all the way up into the 16th of February and then it wanes into the 30th and"
"7035020","7036320"," 15th of the mark."
"7036320","7036580"," Yep."
"7037020","7039380"," So dealers don't want to sell puts. "
"7040200","7045260"," Right there because that means that they are bracing for a downward move at that time."
"7045480","7047380"," Right now they're willing to sell puts."
"7048120","7049540"," And that's why we're seeing red. "
"7050180","7054320"," So this is supportive in the short term and then medium term."
"7054500","7056900"," It shows that IV is rising."
"7057520","7061020"," Now, if you go to the second chart that I have on there, which is the turn structure. "
"7080010","7088230"," So what you see here is the key line is the current IV, the current volatility turn structure."
"7089030","7094510"," Going out till March and gray was yesterday's turn structure."
"7094830","7095590"," So you can see. "
"7097130","7098290"," From yesterday."
"7100290","7105010"," Going out in time IV has come down across the chain."
"7105450","7108150"," Do you see that how it's lower. "
"7108150","7114890"," And this gray, this bluish gray cone that you see is average IV is the."
"7115550","7120310"," Is the 10th to 90th percentile IV on a 60 day look back."
"7120670","7124190"," So we are towards the 90th percentile, but we had blown. "
"7124390","7124730"," That's 22."
"7124910","7125230"," Hold on here."
"7125370","7125710"," Hold on a second. "
"7125850","7126270"," We're on place."
"7129640","7130080"," Continue."
"7131100","7134740"," But yeah, so anyways, what this is showing like so the first. "
"7134740","7136520"," You got it right."
"7136760","7137860"," You got it right."
"7138040","7138360"," You got it right. "
"7138700","7142720"," So IV is dropping across the term structure."
"7143880","7148520"," And that means that is supportive because dealers are willing to sell puts."
"7149320","7149680"," Right now. "
"7151240","7155280"," So dealers are short negative gamma is what that shows."
"7156020","7159400"," Which means it has a positive gamma effect on the market."
"7161510","7165810"," And you see certain areas where there are spikes as tap is pointing up. "
"7165990","7167530"," And those if you look at the dates."
"7168150","7171270"," Those are around your inflection points that we expect."
"7172590","7174330"," When the PCE comes out. "
"7175010","7178350"," When the FOMC is going to happen."
"7178550","7182550"," It's fascinating too because you're like 122 that is heading."
"7182870","7185310"," This is the next down moving to the end of month right here, right?"
"7185870","7186150"," Yeah. "
"7186370","7188650"," So basically it's saying what that is actually showing is IV."
"7188650","7192190"," So they're saying they don't expect that down move on Monday."
"7193690","7194630"," They're selling it. "
"7194710","7198330"," And this is why this is what Jim Carson talks about is wall."
"7198990","7201430"," Well supplied in the market right now."
"7202230","7206290"," If it is well supplied, we are not going to see a flash crash. "
"7206290","7208150"," We might see a stair step down."
"7208630","7213950"," Now they can bring it down even more because if you see like how much space there is left on"
"7213950","7216950"," that cone, they can bring down that wall even more."
"7217570","7220330"," Basically what he's saying to you here is on this chart is. "
"7222230","7224450"," Everyone's saying, well, we're going down here, right?"
"7224870","7228570"," That in fact it's going to be right up something like that, right?"
"7229230","7230650"," That's what everybody's saying."
"7230830","7230990"," Yes."
"7232010","7237770"," And I am saying that no, we're probably not going to dip down that low. "
"7238210","7244430"," So what do you think the what would you what would you surmise as."
"7244430","7247590"," So we're looking at a 30 minute basis here."
"7247950","7253370"," I'm assuming here that not assuming, but you can see this is that part that we were just"
"7253370","7254230"," discussing, right?"
"7254410","7254990"," There's an expectation. "
"7255930","7258730"," You're a bear that you want to see all this wiped out, right?"
"7259470","7261570"," We were looking at this on that Webull chart earlier."
"7262190","7263890"," They'll get that closure down here."
"7263970","7267910"," We're not seeing the acceleration to the downside, right?"
"7268450","7271750"," We're not seeing like we should already be like here, right?"
"7271750","7273610"," For breath where it is. "
"7273830","7274910"," We should already be here basically."
"7275610","7277010"," So breath continues to the downside."
"7277010","7282570"," You get that last blast down and you're also looking at this chart right here. "
"7282670","7284650"," That's telling you, no, don't expect that, right?"
"7285650","7294090"," So I'm 1.22. So if this was you pay your podcast, whatever this aspect of"
"7294090","7301370"," weakness that's anticipated or breath and weakness that's anticipated, you expect any of this down"
"7301370","7301630"," movie."
"7301630","7305250"," Are you expecting to come back down and test this on the 30th?"
"7305770","7309610"," Are you expecting for us to just be kind of muted?"
"7310090","7314990"," I think we start instead of any of this, we're just going to start heading up to the upside."
"7315910","7316310"," Yes. "
"7316590","7323330"," So it kind of depends on what happens today, again, at 1 o'clock and then, you know, Biden is"
"7323330","7324690"," speaking, he's going to take credit."
"7324990","7325950"," He's going to pump the markets."
"7327350","7332030"," So, you know, the jobs number, the market did not want the jobs number to be that hot. "
"7333110","7333550"," Right."
"7334270","7336110"," And he's going to come out and take credit."
"7336430","7341190"," He's been quiet too long and, you know, Trump has been taking all the oxygen on the campaign trail. "
"7341970","7347370"," So Biden has to come out swinging and he's going to basically talk about, talk about that stuff."
"7347830","7349090"," And that's going to pump the market."
"7349090","7358030"," And then tomorrow, honestly, like given the strength in semiconductors, you know, I don't think"
"7358030","7367250"," if tomorrow is mega green, I will, I will probably open a put spread. "
"7369330","7373890"," Because I do not like seeing IV drop down that low."
"7374490","7378070"," I would like the chart, the second chart, the term structures chart I showed."
"7378790","7382470"," Kind of want to see IV right around there, like, don't move up, don't move down. "
"7382890","7386970"," That's equivalent to a 10 to 12% IV right now."
"7387330","7388810"," And I'd rather just have it stay there."
"7389410","7395510"," If IV starts moving up, that means dealers are not selling as many puts, that is a danger sign to"
"7395510","7395670"," me. "
"7395670","7402870"," So, and if you go back to the first chart, the term matrix fixed term fixed like matrix, you kind"
"7402870","7407470"," of see that dealers are right now for the next few days, they are selling puts."
"7408290","7415870"," So I am okay with where we are right now, because when when puts become scarce to buy or they"
"7415870","7419050"," like become more expensive to buy, that becomes an issue."
"7419390","7421530"," That that's that's danger in the market. "
"7421530","7425210"," So right now you see it's all red, right."
"7425690","7429590"," That means dealers are selling IV is lower than where it was in the last 60 days."
"7430710","7431270"," So that's it. "
"7431730","7439430"," So that's kind of like where I'm trying to say like, you know, 4,700 strike, which is 50 points"
"7439430","7442010"," down 60 points down from where we are for today."
"7442190","7442810"," You know, that's losing."
"7443110","7446290"," And even like on the 22nd, they're selling puts there. "
"7446430","7448650"," They don't think we go down to 4,700 on Monday."
"7451140","7451960"," What do you got here?"
"7452820","7453180"," Okay."
"7453480","7453860"," Hold on a second. "
"7454040","7455260"," I got a couple of things you got to do here in the background."
"7455480","7456000"," Continue on."
"7456280","7458400"," We got people chatting and talking in the chat right now. "
"7458400","7459040"," A trade podcast."
"7459340","7460840"," We want to look at Twitch or YouTube."
"7461440","7462900"," Yeah, I am looking at Twitch. "
"7463920","7465260"," You'll have to help me with the YouTube."
"7466220","7467340"," How about you?"
"7467500","7469500"," You look at Twitch and I'll look at YouTube right now."
"7470060","7470340"," Right. "
"7470620","7473440"," You all think market up or down for bond auction."
"7473760","7475340"," It seems to be up the last two times."
"7475380","7476780"," I'll be delayed for the last one. "
"7476780","7479400"," So spaceman, that's a really good question and it dot."
"7481460","7484280"," The David AMS. This is trader podcast, brother. "
"7484840","7485160"," Sorry."
"7485300","7486240"," Then you I didn't mean to interrupt."
"7486240","7486700"," I apologize. "
"7487280","7487940"," No worries."
"7488660","7490080"," Spaceman zero zero three."
"7490280","7497200"," So nobody knows what the anticipation is unless you are a bond trader and your, your desk has told"
"7497200","7498660"," you what the anticipation is. "
"7498840","7501720"," Is it going to be a well subscribed auction or not?"
"7502120","7504100"," But they won't share that information out in public."
"7504100","7511780"," So what you do is at one o'clock, you wait for the tweets to come out as to what"
"7511780","7512480"," the tail was."
"7514020","7517080"," And then you go look at Andy Constance Twitter. "
"7517620","7518020"," That's right."
"7518160","7519120"," What he says."
"7519320","7520340"," What grade he gives it. "
"7520540","7521980"," The A minus C minus."
"7522780","7524160"," Explain these guys."
"7524400","7525420"," What explain this to these guys. "
"7526020","7529360"," Why you follow Andy Constance right now in a simple way."
"7529820","7530220"," Okay."
"7530380","7532040"," So with the with the grading system. "
"7532560","7532920"," Right."
"7533180","7533200"," Okay."
"7533300","7536640"," So Andy Constance is a pre famous. "
"7537980","7544160"," Yeah, like he was he was involved in a lot of stuff that you read about in books."
"7544820","7547580"," There used to be a Solomon brothers before they went defunct."
"7547580","7551200"," And well, he's a legend. "
"7551420","7552260"," He's a legend."
"7552960","7553400"," Yeah."
"7553400","7553440"," Yeah. "
"7553660","7553780"," Yeah."
"7554040","7556640"," And you know, like everybody, like, here's the thing."
"7556980","7560760"," You people can point out bad trades that he's made even I can point them on. "
"7561020","7565820"," But he's had more bangers than he's had bad trades and he has survived in this market without"
"7565820","7567640"," blowing up all these years."
"7568180","7570460"," So that deserves respect."
"7570760","7572360"," And I will not stand for people. "
"7572360","7574800"," You know, disrespecting Andy Constance."
"7575020","7575280"," That's right."
"7575360","7578220"," Because he made a bad call or whatever. "
"7578460","7580280"," And he's was time away with us."
"7581080","7582980"," Yeah, he doesn't convince me like."
"7583820","7588440"," He has been one of the nicest people to educate me about bonds. "
"7588840","7594720"," Like I have asked him like I had like 400 followers of a small account and I like just went"
"7594720","7595320"," into his time."
"7595320","7597360"," Okay, please explain."
"7597920","7600520"," Why do you do these gradings and what the criteria is?"
"7600680","7605260"," So if you go look at his grading system, you'll see if you go on his timeline, you'll see his"
"7605260","7605720"," greatest system. "
"7605920","7606980"," He looks at a lot of stuff."
"7607480","7610940"," He looks at how fat the tail was, how well it was subscribed."
"7611200","7611660"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"7614100","7620400"," And so I don't necessarily agree completely with his grading system, but I don't have to, but he's"
"7620400","7621220"," more right than wrong."
"7621220","7626240"," And what I found is if he gives something a grade of C or above, the market takes that positively."
"7626900","7627980"," The market absorbs that. "
"7628700","7634600"," So if he gives it a grade of C or above the market, cash market takes it positively."
"7635800","7636100"," Yeah."
"7636900","7645180"," It usually, but usually generally, but the number one thing I pay attention to along with Andy's"
"7645180","7649080"," grading is that I will look at what the tail was. "
"7649080","7655640"," And if it is a big fat tail on the auction, which means that certain amount of bonds were not"
"7655640","7659900"," sold at the rate that they wanted to sell them and they have to offer them at a higher rate."
"7660300","7663720"," The market does not take that well."
"7664240","7669020"," So a fat kale is what we don't want to see at one o'clock today. "
"7669820","7672080"," I hope you understand that."
"7672080","7673720"," Greg Radley, I will put his."
"7674040","7675800"," I just put him in just now. "
"7676280","7677640"," So if you're out there, right?"
"7678560","7681100"," And you don't already follow Andy Conston."
"7681960","7683320"," He's on fin twit."
"7684580","7690080"," This guy's famous man, like he legitimately on Wall Street. "
"7690240","7691200"," This guy's known man."
"7691380","7692120"," He's trusted."
"7692520","7694840"," You don't like you go to him for an answer. "
"7696220","7697180"," The market."
"7697680","7699560"," I'm going to tell Andy he's going to."
"7700260","7701360"," I just said a bunch. "
"7701500","7702340"," I'm going to tell him right now."
"7703140","7704760"," Sending a bunch of you follows your way."
"7706080","7708740"," Yeah, I love Andy and he takes time. "
"7708880","7710040"," Andy Conston is."
"7711900","7713940"," He's the straight man and."
"7715100","7716160"," And Jimmy Jude. "
"7716920","7718040"," Two man."
"7718660","7721700"," Jimmy Jude is is the foul mouth."
"7722280","7724380"," Like he's the Deadpool of markets. "
"7724380","7727100"," Like he makes jokes and he is."
"7728800","7731560"," Raunchy AF, but you know, it's."
"7732180","7737400"," It's a good time talking to those guys and they're very, very generous with their time too. "
"7737620","7739880"," So if you ask a sharp question, they will answer."
"7739880","7743220"," I just follow and absorb knowledge from them."
"7744260","7747520"," The other guy, I'm going to post his name here right now too. "
"7747720","7749060"," His name is Jimmy Jude."
"7749800","7751020"," I love Jimmy Jude."
"7751820","7752140"," Yeah. "
"7754400","7757100"," So here's his if you're not already following him."
"7759150","7760970"," I'll pop that guy in there too."
"7761630","7762110"," Right. "
"7762930","7763430"," So anyways."
"7764950","7767270"," Yeah, is there anything else you want me to talk about cap?"
"7767530","7769210"," I mean, I think this is great for a day, man."
"7769910","7770370"," Yeah. "
"7771130","7772150"," Well, thank you for having me."
"7772290","7773290"," I really appreciate it."
"7773570","7776830"," I appreciate the exposure as well. "
"7776950","7779270"," And I hope people and chatter on the stream."
"7779590","7786250"," Like, you know, I wouldn't say learn something new, but you know, I brought something to the"
"7786250","7790990"," forefront that they were perhaps ignorant of or did not know that you could even like look at these"
"7790990","7791230"," things."
"7791770","7793630"," So I hope that is helpful. "
"7793810","7794450"," Do me a solid."
"7794610","7796810"," If you're watching the show right now, would you guys give me a solid?"
"7796950","7799850"," Matter of fact, I'm going to put a chair podcast in there too."
"7800670","7801950"," I should have put him in there. "
"7804170","7805750"," Give me a solid if you're out there."
"7805950","7811230"," Can you guys give me a quick favor really quick if you're watching the show right now?"
"7811230","7812230"," Shit, I did that wrong."

"7817060","7827210"," Yeah, that's"
"7827210","7829850"," going right to the 475 and rejecting twice."
"7831570","7832370"," That's OK."
"7834930","7842010"," The expected move today was 0.63%. And I think we are over that. "
"7842790","7844390"," No, we still have some upside left."
"7844390","7845350"," Do me a solid."
"7845570","7852030"," If you're watching the stream right now, can you guys like and retweet the tweet that I just made"
"7852030","7856450"," about following dance spring and Jimmy Jude on Twitter?"
"7856830","7858030"," Just make sure it gets out there. "
"7858170","7864250"," Make sure those guys are getting followers from young traders, young investors, that kind of stuff."
"7864910","7873550"," So if you're in the stream right now, do you mind just liking that tweet and retweeting it?"
"7878850","7879370"," Appreciate it."
"7879470","7882770"," Give me a solid out there on on 10 to it. "
"7887220","7888940"," Yeah, he's on a break right now."
"7889760","7890960"," Andy Constance has been a break."
"7891160","7899980"," He has popped in though he's every once in"
"7899980","7911600"," a"
"7911600","7911600"," while, he'll pop in and try to give it. "
"7913580","7916280"," Smart guys, and you got the fin twit mob, right?"
"7916420","7919040"," They like to pour the gasoline like fucking fire on fire."

"7924300","7930120"," like everybody who puts up who puts themselves out there and, you know, give the read on the"
"7930120","7930500"," market."
"7931040","7932440"," They might not be right. "
"7932620","7935160"," They might not be wrong, but like they're taking a stand, right?"
"7935360","7937860"," They're putting they're putting themselves out there and that deserves respect."
"7938900","7939260"," Yeah."
"7939380","7941220"," Do we want these people gone or something?"
"7941440","7942600"," Like that's my big questions. "
"7942840","7944860"," I was like, do you want you like what would it like?"
"7945460","7948600"," I feel like going to these guys like I think some of them do it like that they sometimes they"
"7948600","7951620"," do it wrong to like Jim has been a block happy."
"7952620","7953560"," Rightfully so, right?"
"7953820","7956560"," And you know, like I got blocked by Jim at one point."
"7956640","7958080"," Then he blocked him. "
"7958160","7958600"," He blocked me."
"7958660","7963560"," And then someone asked if he was like, I don't just like Jim in any way, she performed and he"
"7963560","7964120"," unblocked me."
"7964120","7965620"," And I am blocked him. "
"7965780","7966920"," And of course, I like him too."
"7967040","7973800"," And I like Andy and Jimmy and all those guys, you know, these guys are just adding to our"
"7973800","7975100"," experience, right?"

"7993200","7998600"," of highlights some of the more esoteric trades that come through."
"7999340","8003320"," He he understands positioning well, he's been a market maker."
"8003800","8009300"," So if he sees something like he's the one who alerted me to the VIX trade. "
"8009300","8013400"," And that was his handle out there for you guys too, for vault signals."
"8013840","8016060"," Yeah, vault signals is good."

"8064570","8067330"," Anyways, questions out there."
"8067830","8073550"," If there's any last requests for stocks to look at for their options expiry, I'm happy to do that"
"8073550","8074050"," right now."
"8074710","8075330"," Before I leave. "
"8076470","8078470"," Mike Silva comes on the show all the time."
"8078630","8079850"," I have a great respect for him."
"8079870","8082270"," He gives great technical analysis. "

"8107320","8107880"," Yeah."
"8108220","8108380"," Yeah."
"8108700","8110760"," So I have a, I have a theory. "
"8111040","8112280"," What's that?"
"8112940","8116560"," I have a theory about why he's so anti Bitcoin right now."
"8116600","8118300"," You tell me what your theory is."
"8118300","8127080"," My theory is, okay, yesterday we had $2 billion in inflows into those ETFs yet, yet Bitcoin price"
"8127080","8127700"," went down. "
"8128220","8134880"," Why are, why is money going into these ETFs and Bitcoin price is stuck between 42 and 43 K?"
"8135260","8136420"," Why do you think that?"
"8138060","8140620"," I, I, it's a rhetorical question."
"8140980","8141620"," Here's what I think."
"8141640","8144060"," I'm trying to open up a background here. "
"8144160","8144440"," Hold on."
"8144440","8144820"," Okay."
"8147170","8152830"," So the question is, why do you think there's all these inflows into the new Bitcoin ETF?"
"8153590","8155870"," Yeah, but Bitcoin price is not rising. "
"8156190","8157050"," It's not rising."
"8157210","8158630"," We'll be the thesis behind this."
"8159290","8167870"," They're basically my, my theory is that traditional finance is loading up on these ETFs and then"
"8167870","8174330"," they'll rip the price of BTC because they already held a bunch of BTC when they got approved. "
"8175170","8182490"," So they're basically allowing their friends to get on the boat before they roll it out."
"8183230","8186030"," So that's, that's my theory."
"8186870","8188950"," There's a diamond's behind some of this or no?"
"8189730","8195370"," Well, JPM is involved in the couple of the ETFs. "
"8195910","8201690"," And that's why I think it's really funny that Coinbase is getting shellacked because, well,"
"8202090","8208549"," Coinbase, there was a lot of options positioning, like going into two weeks ago, like when it hit"
"8208549","8215809"," like 180 or so, 190 or so, like it was like, it was, it was, it was cooking under a"
"8215809","8216590"," lot of calls."
"8216889","8221090"," And then all those got like monetized or like sold and dealers brought them back."
"8221270","8226209"," So dealers could sell the underlying, but I think it's just really funny because where Bitcoin was"
"8226209","8231930"," three weeks ago and where Coinbase was three weeks ago, it seems to be going at a discount right"
"8231930","8232190"," now. "
"8232190","8233990"," Especially with the ETFs going off."
"8234430","8242750"," So I think Jamie coming out and trash talking BTC is just, he's trying to talk his book right now."
"8242809","8246469"," He wants the price low so he can buy more ETFs into their funds. "
"8249790","8253030"," Anyways, somebody has an XBI and I don't."
"8253049","8258090"," Okay, I am, I would not look into that because that's an index level product."
"8259790","8261889"," And there's a lot of shit codes in it. "
"8262030","8265530"," If there's a shit go inside, I don't want me to look at, I could do that."
"8266290","8272510"," But just generally 28% of call volume is expiring and 24 or 20% of put volume is expiring"
"8272510","8273250"," on IWM."
"8273610","8274469"," But that doesn't mean anything. "
"8274690","8276030"," It's a very liquid index."
"8276610","8281230"," This is specifically what I'm concerned about is it's a single stock expert."
"8281490","8283309"," It's the biggest one in history. "
"8284030","8291410"," The single stocks that have the or going to have greater the greatest impact or impacts that you"
"8291410","8292510"," can actually see, right?"
"8293090","8302850"," Yeah, so carvana, call wall at 50, put wall at 40, call volume expiring is 36 "
"8302850","8306430",".5% and put volume expiring is about 30%."
"8306430","8311030"," And I would say that that's somewhat weaker, but it's already been weak for the last three, four"
"8311030","8311250"," days."
"8311910","8317690"," So, you know, I wouldn't feel comfortable making a call about carvana. "
"8318430","8320150"," And carvana also has this other thing, right?"
"8320309","8321730"," Like it's a highly shorted stock."
"8322469","8331270"," So any sort of bid to cover in the market where you see like IWM, like just ripping, you will"
"8331270","8335170"," see carvana basically lead the charge because it's, you know, king of the shit code."
"8335170","8338670"," So JPM, I haven't, what a boy, I haven't said that. "
"8339170","8340530"," Let me look at JPM."
"8343850","8350430"," 44% of call volume expiring and 30% of put volume expiring, call walls at 175, put wall is"
"8350430","8359190"," at 167.5. So, to me, and it's risk reversal is like really low and IV rank is really, I"
"8359190","8366730"," don't, I don't see a downside as much in JPM from options positioning."
"8367049","8374450"," It could be like secular news that brings them, that brings KRE and XLF down, but I don't see"
"8374450","8375709"," anything specific for JPM. "
"8378990","8381250"," AMD missed AMD did someone get that."
"8382010","8382650"," Sure."
"8382850","8383370"," I look up AMD. "
"8383969","8388490"," AMD put wall 120 call wall 150."
"8388890","8390010"," It's way above that."
"8390010","8396190"," So I don't have, I don't have as lagging right now due to, so I don't have to ramp on"
"8396190","8398510"," the anticipation of rate cuts. "
"8399210","8404810"," So if there's anticipation of rate cuts, you'll get the amplification effect on IWM."
"8405190","8408030"," The moments that anyone thinks that there won't be any rate cuts."
"8408570","8411790"," That's where you see IWM start lagging and not. "
"8411790","8417370"," So there's, there's a nuance thing over there too that I want to highlight cap."
"8417570","8421490"," I was reading society general's economist report."
"8422710","8429950"," And they had something very interesting to say they said, even though rates might get cut. "
"8430710","8439570"," There are a lot of companies in IWM that are free cash flow negative and they do not have good"
"8439570","8440610"," balance sheets."
"8441230","8447570"," And they are still going to have a hard time finding funding."
"8448130","8451670"," So the rate cuts might not help them as much and that got me thinking. "
"8451670","8461470"," So I want to highlight a different ticker, similar basket, IWM, which is your growth small"
"8461470","8467730"," and mid caps, which might benefit because a lot of them when I like personally looked at the"
"8467730","8470650"," components of that a lot of them have good balance sheets."
"8470650","8474650"," Or do you think the stock growth stuff that we show in the show that has like good year over"
"8474650","8481170"," year profits, real, real money for real products launched the first last three years, great"
"8481170","8481530"," guidance."
"8482330","8482890"," Right. "
"8483350","8493190"," And so IWM long IW or short could be a good pair trade if you anticipate rate cuts."
"8493830","8496890"," So that should outperform IWM by itself."
"8497650","8499450"," Is what the thinking would be. "
"8501590","8509910"," But again, but generally, as you said, you would expect as rates get cut smaller, small, medium cap"
"8509910","8517690"," businesses are going to feel some relief and investors should technically support them to the"
"8517690","8517970"," upside."
"8522760","8524560"," Heber, it's a great question."
"8524820","8529380"," What's your view in China stocks like Baba and Neo, I am currently in the red. "
"8530040","8536160"," Full disclosure, I have June call spreads on Kweb."
"8536680","8541380"," I have 27 slash 32 C's on Kweb."
"8542040","8548760"," And that is, I am generally bullish China because I think she needs. "
"8550760","8555740"," She's trying to take steps to like fix some of the economic problems they have."
"8555960","8558080"," They might just, you know, print a bunch of money."
"8558540","8564580"," They're also meeting today with us counterparts to talk about trade between us and China. "
"8564820","8565580"," So trying to."
"8569630","8569990"," Yeah."
"8570250","8571170"," Oh, yeah, stretching balls. "
"8571290","8571490"," You're right."
"8571690","8571990"," I'm sorry."
"8572070","8573070"," I might have flipped those around. "
"8576410","8578730"," So, yeah, anyway, so I am."
"8579050","8579810"," Give me one second."
"8579990","8582030"," I have to take a break here. "
"8582130","8582690"," I've got a cat."
"8583010","8583190"," That's."
"8584730","8586270"," I have a cat that's knocking. "
"8586830","8587790"," Give me one quick second."
"8589630","8592250"," Or you if you want to chat with the group, can you chat?"
"8592450","8593990"," Well, I just give me one quick second."
"8593990","8594250"," Sure. "
"8594610","8595270"," For sure."
"8599670","8601530"," Are you, are you still there?"
"8602030","8602730"," Yeah, I'm here."
"8603030","8603490"," Can you hear me?"
"8603710","8604270"," Yeah, I'm here. "
"8604570","8606910"," So read the chat and see what these guys are saying here."
"8607250","8608430"," Yeah, I got you, man."
"8608670","8609910"," Did I mix this XBI?"
"8610270","8612350"," Yeah, no, you did not because I did not look it up. "
"8612370","8613630"," Let me look up XBI."
"8619560","8620940"," Call walls and 95."
"8622200","8623160"," Put wall is at 90. "
"8623420","8624720"," It's below its put wall right now."
"8625380","8630420"," But call volume expiring is only 7% and put volume expiring is 36%."
"8631920","8635060"," So yeah, that is actually kind of bullish. "
"8635420","8637580"," I've been, I own XDI stock."
"8637940","8638580"," I've owned it for."
"8639440","8640620"," I want it since November. "
"8641340","8643260"," So I am very, very happy with that position."
"8643500","8644580"," I plan on holding it."
"8645420","8654420"," I've also said in the past that XBI is the ultimate indicator of risk on in the market because it"
"8654420","8655920"," is highly speculative biotech. "
"8656940","8662360"," And if money is going into biotech means money is going to go to NDX, NDX usually follows XBI."
"8662820","8666100"," It didn't do that last year, but usually it follows XBI."
"8666760","8671810"," So we looking at an intraday bear flag forming. "
"8672770","8673510"," My chart."
"8674830","8684680"," I mean, it could be, but I see more of a bonking against"
"8684680","8693200"," the big fat gamma at 475 on five, which is also the volatility trigger."
"8693720","8698860"," So above that, we should see supportive flows like really kicking above 475. "
"8699340","8701920"," That's why we keep bonking our head against 475 and getting rejected."
"8704730","8706830"," I've got these young cats, man, these kittens."
"8707570","8707970"," Yeah. "
"8708330","8711010"," And they are, they don't leave."
"8711810","8714130"," So I had the other day at the cats in the office."
"8714130","8716570"," The cats came in the one cat specifically came in the office. "
"8717310","8719570"," And she's just walking by me going, I'm going to knock those."
"8719750","8721290"," I matter of fact, they still have lights in the ground now."
"8721450","8724610"," She's they're like, I'm going to knock these lights off that light off. "
"8724750","8726750"," I'm going to knock that quote light in the court."
"8726930","8730710"," And the kid, they're like pop looking at me going, I'm going to break this lamp over here."
"8733050","8733450"," Leave. "
"8734690","8736390"," I don't normally have cats."
"8736570","8736930"," We have cats."
"8737930","8741330"," You have anything on a counter anywhere or on a shelf anywhere. "
"8743070","8743870"," Yeah, anything."
"8744150","8745570"," They're just like knocking that over."
"8745850","8747630"," Yeah, they just want to hear that noise, man. "
"8748030","8750210"," They just want to hear that the crashing noise."
"8750570","8752310"," Oh, it's sitting up here."
"8752490","8754050"," Oh, it's going to look so much better on the floor. "
"8754330","8755490"," You get a boss right there."
"8755710","8755790"," Go."
"8755970","8759250"," Can you even have a boss at home with the cat, I guess?"
"8759530","8759770"," I don't know. "
"8759770","8760030"," Yeah."
"8760490","8766190"," So I had two cats for 14 years that both passed away within two months of each other."
"8767730","8774610"," Yeah, man, like I had to basically be very, very careful of not leaving any food out, not leaving"
"8774610","8778370"," anything that could be through all the objects. "
"8779010","8779370"," Yes."
"8779870","8780050"," Yes."
"8781050","8786830"," And, you know, yeah, anyways, now I feed a neighborhood cat, like who do you?"
"8787090","8789710"," I don't know. "
"8789710","8790830"," I live in a really nice neighborhood."
"8791130","8791650"," So I'm really surprised."
"8792030","8795190"," There's like a, like a stray cat and, you know, like it comes in. "
"8795190","8797350"," The stray cats, right?"
"8798150","8798150"," Yeah."
"8798890","8801090"," So anyways, it's kind of funny."
"8803550","8808510"," And a work saying that all of his house plants have been consumed. "
"8809410","8810210"," Oh, man."
"8810850","8812010"," I know that feeling."
"8813930","8819690"," We, we, yeah, that's. "
"8819690","8825630"," And a work is actually, I started growing catnip in a planter."
"8826470","8831210"," And that, you know, prevented them from eating other plants because they gave them something to"
"8831210","8831370"," eat."
"8831590","8832370"," Yeah, that's good. "
"8832490","8832610"," Yeah."
"8832930","8836370"," And that just kind of gets them stoned and they just, you know, they should just chill."
"8836770","8838510"," We grew, we grew like this. "
"8838730","8840330"," We're having a little bit of liquidation break here."
"8840450","8843850"," We went up growing this really tall grass."
"8844430","8847450"," Like a maze in our backyard for the dogs to go through. "
"8847790","8849110"," It's like pussy willow type stuff."
"8849530","8853170"," But then we planted catnip as the base cover."
"8853990","8856270"," And our cats love it. "
"8857570","8860910"," Love the catnip in the yard, but we don't do it inside."
"8861090","8862030"," I should probably grow some inside."
"8862890","8863370"," Yeah. "
"8864030","8864830"," I mean, it's just weird."
"8864990","8865310"," It's easy."
"8865790","8866550"," It's easy. "
"8866870","8868270"," And, you know, it's easy for men."
"8869390","8869870"," Yeah."
"8870170","8871070"," I've got some catnip seeds. "
"8871370","8872630"," So we're going to try that now."
"8872630","8875370"," I think I have a bag of potting soil in my garage."
"8875690","8877950"," So maybe we'll do that for a winter. "
"8878130","8879710"," And I've got LED grow lights, man."
"8880590","8882490"," I know why you live in Michigan, man."
"8882650","8887490"," I think what are you guys in Michigan, right?"
"8887630","8888430"," Is it you or Bork?"
"8888630","8891770"," Or, I know you're in Iran rapids, aren't you?"
"8892430","8893430"," Yeah, for the most part. "
"8893630","8893630"," Yeah."
"8893950","8893990"," Right."
"8901810","8902610"," Right on. "
"8902610","8903110"," Yeah."
"8903330","8904750"," This is this is support."
"8904830","8905450"," It's holding. "
"8905710","8905830"," Okay."
"8905990","8908950"," Anyway, it's I'm not in any intraday trades."
"8909210","8910170"," I am in a spread. "
"8910750","8911950"," I'm just sitting and chilling."
"8912610","8914090"," I'm in the same spread as you, Cap."
"8914490","8915550"," I don't know if you sold or not. "
"8915730","8916090"," I sold."
"8916410","8918770"," I was pretty much in the money by the time we opened this morning."
"8918770","8919110"," So. "
"8919510","8919790"," Yeah."
"8920370","8920370"," Yeah."
"8920830","8921010"," I'm. "
"8921350","8923490"," Are you in the seven and the 75s or no?"
"8924010","8924270"," Yeah."
"8924850","8928330"," And are you going to close or whatever you you come up or no?"
"8928870","8929890"," Yeah, I think so."
"8930050","8932110"," Unless, you know, like I go below my. "
"8933490","8933890"," CB."
"8934790","8939110"," And then I would consider selling because you don't want to trade to go red, you know, even $10"
"8939110","8942170"," positive trade is a positive trade in my book."
"8942710","8943110"," So. "
"8943590","8943750"," Yeah."
"8943850","8948970"," And as we get closer to the, they started to trim the trim on that spread to start to get"
"8948970","8953810"," eaten up, even if a lot of the curve would go down and then only if you close the money"
"8953810","8956270"," with the print less, like the minutes of the close."
"8957230","8957670"," Right. "
"8957990","8962290"," And 475 as you have marked on your chart is like a big gamma bar."
"8962970","8963030"," Right."
"8963210","8966010"," I do expect price to kind of go towards that. "
"8966950","8969510"," Where's the end of the day and the reason it's a very simple."
"8969670","8970050"," Right here."
"8970070","8970470"," Here's that. "
"8970650","8972410"," He's talking about that gamma bar that's right here."
"8972510","8973590"," This is the one that he's talking about."
"8973690","8974730"," He wants to see that last. "
"8975390","8977170"," A little tag up there by Friday."
"8977850","8978290"," Right."
"8978650","8979950"," And this is not that one. "
"8980090","8983330"," Like on 475, like I think you're like way too high."
"8983330","8984130"," I've been talking about."
"8984630","8986910"," Oh, gotcha. "
"8988010","8989610"," Yeah, that's your 4800."
"8989850","8990830"," Like what number is that?"
"8991110","8991650"," Oh, sorry."
"8991730","8995370"," This is a 4775 on SPX. "
"8995390","8995570"," Okay."
"8996190","8996230"," Yeah."
"8996530","9002410"," So that's, that's, that's, that's, there's decent gamma there, but I'm talking about this 475 on"
"9002410","9003310"," SPY. "
"9004010","9006870"," That's the volatility trigger on."
"9008530","9008970"," Yeah."
"9009090","9010330"," This is your tag right here. "
"9010330","9010810"," Yeah."
"9011190","9012750"," So we kind of got a tag earlier."
"9012830","9014450"," We bonked our head against it twice. "
"9014910","9016330"," Now we're getting a liquidation break."
"9016730","9019050"," I would expect this to get bought up."
"9019070","9021890"," And it's just kind of funny. "
"9022130","9026710"," We're seeing more because we're under 475, which is the volatility trigger, you're going to see"
"9026710","9029810"," more intuitive volatility up and down."
"9030210","9035330"," So we're just seeing some down and, you know, we should see equally fast."
"9038390","9039050"," Recovery's. "
"9039570","9041210"," So let's kind of the thesis."
"9041610","9045690"," I still think as long as we're like closing up a 475, I'll stay in that spread."
"9046870","9048400"," I don't have many. "
"9049950","9050930"," Open positions."
"9051710","9052530"," I am most."
"9053530","9057230"," Like 60% cash in like my play account. "
"9057870","9060590"," My gamble folio, which is my gamble folio."
"9060910","9061350"," Yeah."
"9062770","9064490"," And I'm just waiting. "
"9064490","9067430"," I'm waiting to buy dips is what I'm waiting to do."
"9067850","9070010"," Right here and see if we see any beginning."
"9071110","9073750"," So a little bit of a little bit of a stick bed down here. "
"9074950","9076690"," Yeah, maybe another three, four points."
"9079870","9080710"," Yeah, there's."
"9082230","9083650"," Let me move this back over here. "
"9088730","9090550"," So I'm going to use down here."
"9090870","9093990"," Use breaking below their one and five minute trigger right here."
"9096010","9096450"," Yeah. "
"9100320","9103180"," We had 130 yet or is it just, oh, it's 12 o'clock."
"9103320","9104100"," It's not even one 30 yet."
"9104420","9109060"," No, it's one o'clock is when we in an hour, we get the auction. "
"9109640","9111400"," So the dollar is also rising."
"9111500","9112340"," That's the thing."
"9112840","9114880"," And I think that's what's causing this. "
"9116740","9118100"," Repricing right now."
"9118320","9119740"," It's what I do with a nice roll on it."
"9119900","9123540"," And I had a confirmation on a bear playing to the down seven or one minute trigger. "
"9124860","9127240"," And the X has a gap they've left down below."
"9127920","9131980"," The gap is to 16, 7, 48, 39."
"9133400","9136820"," Tesla still bleeding out right now. "
"9138060","9139620"," T and X had a little rip there."
"9140360","9142680"," Little snorkel cane Vicks looking."
"9143000","9145120"," We might actually get some significant downside here. "
"9145200","9146860"," We've got a bear cross right now in the one minute."
"9147420","9149100"," One and five minute on spy."
"9149420","9150360"," You can see it right here. "
"9150860","9152740"," So you get the cross right there happening."
"9154740","9155840"," We're sitting at support."
"9156600","9157680"," Nice little relief. "
"9157860","9159460"," Nice little relief pull back here."
"9161000","9163360"," And Vicks looks great to the upside right now."
"9163580","9167160"," Not not confirmed at the moment, but it's looking like it. "
"9168340","9173700"," If you are in zero dates here and you get in torch, you're likely going to get another chance here"
"9173700","9175940"," to exit in case it does roll to the downside."
"9179190","9180370"," Yeah, I'm flat right now, man."
"9180470","9180810"," I'm in nothing. "
"9180810","9184750"," I got I took my money and ran this morning and I'm just sitting here waiting."
"9185470","9189910"," And if anything, I'm going to wait for whatever that upside target is and try to grow."
"9190090","9194010"," I think I want some put spreads into the next weekend. "
"9194490","9199330"," Yeah, I like to get something in the end of the month that's like in the money ish on a"
"9199330","9199630"," high."
"9200770","9205050"," Hoping on Friday's close that there's at least close or the open."
"9205290","9207990"," It's either going to be open, I believe, or the end of the day. "
"9207990","9213250"," And then I can grab that put spread for expiry of the 30th of January."
"9213570","9220270"," Yeah, I'm going to be looking at positioning that develops in the next like, you know, like"
"9220270","9223990"," tomorrow as well within the mag seven."
"9225850","9228030"," Because that's going to be the barometer. "
"9228270","9231120"," So Tesla, as you know, is the one that's underperforming."
"9232150","9234070"," Amazon has been performing well."
"9236210","9239550"," Apple basically erased all of its weakness. "
"9241230","9242250"," It's such a crime."
"9243090","9246490"," I like, you know, second of January, you get the first downgrade."
"9247050","9250210"," Then two days later, you get the second downgrade. "
"9250710","9251350"," It hits 180."
"9252290","9257350"," Like, you know, yesterday, you know, it's like 180.02, you know, like, I think it's like touch"
"9257350","9257630"," that."
"9257770","9261950"," And I was just like, Oh, man, another downgrade and the market is cooked. "
"9261950","9266670"," And this morning, an upgrade, potential 25% upside."
"9267130","9270910"," And I was just like, okay, this is, this is a crime."
"9271710","9278850"," You know, they just washed out everybody that got bearish on apple because they saw 180 getting"
"9278850","9286110"," slammed and then price not being able to recover above 182.5. Let's look at that 30 minute here on"
"9286110","9287170"," Tesla. "
"9295950","9297170"," You know, Tesla, man."
"9298090","9299810"," Don't quote me on this here."
"9300030","9309880"," But the thing that bothers me about Tesla here is, the"
"9309880","9313540"," thing that bothers me here is on this run right here, you got buyers, right?"
"9313720","9318420"," Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, being told no on all this stuff right here. "
"9318600","9323840"," I'm assuming that there's going to be some kind of a group that thinks the next trip is right here."
"9324120","9331220"," But I'm personally afraid on this next like January to March run, maybe you get that."
"9331620","9335800"," But then that mark, this is the real low down here sometime in that mid March. "
"9337780","9340000"," There can be an argument that."
"9341740","9347100"," The can be an argument that you might get like that, that you would that run that we're talking"
"9347100","9347840"," about in there."
"9347920","9349060"," I guess I can make that bigger. "
"9349820","9350340"," Maybe."
"9351980","9353460"," But dude, like."
"9357340","9360400"," That would be an incredible run. "
"9360600","9361280"," If that happens."
"9361680","9362020"," Yeah."
"9362840","9363600"," Where's that?"
"9364040","9365140"," This here could go. "
"9367470","9371370"," This here could actually go way down here to."
"9372310","9372910"," 165?"
"9373690","9373870"," No."
"9375070","9376910"," 77 to set $78. "
"9377710","9381810"," Are we going to reprice Tesla from a tech company to a car company again?"
"9382250","9384410"," I think we're going to close the gap down."
"9384550","9387210"," There's a giant gap where this yellow bar is right."
"9387210","9390270"," You know, there's a possibility of like we get the run. "
"9391030","9396490"," In a February and maybe you get tagged that red one, but then there's like a major bloodbath"
"9396490","9396850"," coming."
"9398090","9405610"," But whatever this is, whatever, if it's here, if it's here, if it's here, it does lead to some"
"9405610","9406410"," significant."
"9408590","9409150"," Yeah. "
"9409990","9412310"," Yeah, Tesla goes down there."
"9412630","9417150"," All the equity, all the tracking functions here too."
"9417470","9417570"," So. "
"9418850","9421310"," All the ETF tracking funds."
"9421790","9423870"," Tap if it goes on to 80 bucks."
"9424770","9426050"," They're going to sell. "
"9427250","9428450"," Spy so hard."
"9429170","9430430"," Because they're tracking that internally."
"9430770","9435190"," They don't buy spy, but they buy the components and equal weighted. "
"9436010","9439190"," And spot and Tesla is a big part of spy."
"9439510","9441150"," I want to show you this here."
"9441430","9442290"," I want to show you this. "
"9442290","9443510"," So this part."
"9443930","9445390"," I agree with what you're saying."
"9445850","9449110"," Or I normally would, but I just want to direct your attention to this right here. "
"9449690","9452210"," And then I want you to look at this right here."
"9453510","9455450"," We do SPX or spy."
"9464810","9465750"," A lot of second here. "
"9467410","9469250"," Hey, we'll look at it for a hold on a second here."
"9469390","9471110"," Well, let's give me one."
"9472250","9478440"," I just do something new, maybe. "
"9479560","9480560"," New layout."
"9483740","9485240"," Tesla here, right?"
"9485780","9495780"," And I want to"
"9495780","9498320"," draw your attention to October."
"9501970","9502310"," Of. "
"9503910","9508390"," This is when this is when we got the bounce in spy."
"9508950","9510190"," It's October."
"9511050","9512670"," And then spy started turning. "
"9513150","9515990"," And you'll notice that that last little leg right here."
"9516590","9519370"," Tesla went down and did not follow the market up."
"9519810","9521430"," Do you get what I'm saying here?"
"9521710","9522450"," Yeah, I see. "
"9522670","9525050"," You see that last little bit down there."
"9525930","9529130"," Main on correlate directly with SPY."
"9529370","9530770"," So you get the small dip and rip. "
"9530770","9531590"," You come down here."
"9532710","9536010"," Well, I guess you get the small dip here and then you get that rip."
"9536270","9538090"," Then you get that that March low. "
"9538880","9542750"," And you might not see you might not see Tesla quite follow up."
"9542910","9546470"," It might just fucking consolidate and then blast down."
"9546770","9551970"," It might not join in on this next rip is my point that I'm trying to make here. "
"9552410","9553530"," You get what I'm saying?"
"9554010","9554830"," Yeah, I do."
"9555990","9559090"," So there's a chance here that Tesla."
"9559410","9563190"," My point here is if spies going up here. "
"9563190","9567630"," And you might just see Tesla kind of like do its fucking thing."
"9567630","9569930"," And then it joins in for that March low down here."
"9571950","9576990"," I don't like saying that because it's going to piss off our or we have a lot of testables here. "
"9579520","9581020"," But you disagree, right?"
"9581140","9582860"," You think that Tesla's going to join in the party?"
"9583560","9584020"," Because what you're saying?"
"9584480","9588600"," I don't know."
"9589020","9596440"," No, I honestly don't have to."
"9596440","9598860"," I'm trying to find the 165 on Tesla. "
"9600840","9603540"," You know, you say this is that what time I missed that last part."
"9603560","9605560"," 165 on Tesla."
"9606260","9612280"," I would see like, I would see a fair amount of risk to award. "
"9613420","9615360"," In that area."
"9616120","9616500"," But."
"9618180","9623900"," You know, I could see what you're saying to, you know, the old adages, all gaps must be filled. "
"9623900","9632520"," And if Elon continues to basically, you know, be like, give me 120 more billion inequity and make"
"9632520","9635780"," me charge a Tesla, otherwise I'm like, you know, taking all this stuff."
"9635940","9636700"," We're just a car company now, right?"
"9637420","9637700"," Yeah."
"9637900","9641000"," So if it's just a car company, then it should get treated like a car company. "
"9641260","9648420"," If it's a tech company that's that happens to make cars, that's a much different proposition than"
"9648420","9650740"," it deserves that premium in multiple."
"9650740","9653620"," And that's where fundamentals actually matter, right?"
"9653820","9661100"," Fraud, no longer a growth company or a growth company or, you know, another thing, another one"
"9661100","9664760"," that's fascinating about Tesla specifically right now, they have a significant quick take from you"
"9664760","9665580"," than putting it in the spot."
"9665640","9666720"," You don't have to answer this. "
"9667200","9673320"," I've been going down the rabbit hole of some of these Chinese car manufacturers and they're trying"
"9673320","9679560"," to now assemble in the US and put some of these cars on market here in the US."
"9680120","9680520"," Yeah."
"9680760","9681500"," They're killing it. "
"9682100","9682500"," Yeah."
"9683320","9684880"," You know, you don't need to go with that back."
"9685220","9686020"," You're from Detroit. "
"9686400","9687120"," I mean, you live in Detroit."
"9687400","9688880"," You understand the car thing, right?"
"9689140","9689220"," Yep."
"9689840","9690280"," I have a lot of friends. "
"9690280","9692340"," How the Japanese cars come here?"
"9692640","9693020"," Say again."
"9693560","9695240"," How did the Japanese cars come here?"
"9695420","9696640"," We did not let them import."
"9696640","9702500"," We had huge taxes on Japanese imports because they were eating the lunch of American companies. "
"9702580","9702860"," That's right."
"9703220","9707640"," And so the so Toyota said, Hey, you guys in Detroit?"
"9707900","9708860"," Do you want to partner up?"
"9708860","9711720"," And make cars together?"
"9712260","9714700"," The first car was a disaster that they made together."
"9715060","9722060"," But that allowed them to get a foothold into Kentucky, into Ohio, and start putting in car"
"9722060","9722980"," manufacturing plants. "
"9723640","9725940"," And they did it in the heartland where labor was cheap."
"9726600","9727700"," China is following the same playbook."
"9729260","9731780"," It's following the exact same playbook. "
"9731780","9734960"," I'm like, I know that I'm always the guy."
"9735040","9738420"," It's like Elon welcomes competition and wants to see this happening."
"9738420","9739440"," He might not survive it. "
"9740060","9741540"," He's even made that statement, right?"
"9741740","9745360"," Well, like most car companies don't survive just normal operations."
"9747220","9748900"," They go bankrupt all the fucking time."
"9749060","9751620"," It's the norm for a car company. "
"9752020","9753380"," But I'm with you on this."
"9753500","9754740"," Like there's a real threat here."
"9755100","9759240"," If I don't believe that Elon's going to remove that stuff from Tesla. "
"9760040","9764680"," But I think it's a play to get Tesla cheap that he can buy as well to help pay Twitter,"
"9764880","9765460"," in my view."
"9766120","9768020"," But there is some real risk to Tesla."
"9768960","9770360"," I don't think it's American. "
"9770680","9771880"," I think it's Chinese."
"9772660","9774400"," I think there's actual risk to."
"9775200","9775640"," Yeah. "
"9775860","9776400"," No, I don't."
"9777760","9778640"," I agree."
"9779260","9781700"," Have you been to China recently?"
"9782340","9784220"," I haven't been there in over a decade. "
"9784220","9785360"," All right."
"9785620","9792600"," So about three years ago, I went to China and I did like a three week long tour of China."
"9794060","9797740"," And part of it was work, part of it was, you know, pleasure. "
"9798520","9801380"," And they were building all these highways, these brand new highways."
"9802080","9808900"," And I know it's really fun and involved to make fun of China and, you know, their empty go series."
"9809580","9810580"," But I will tell you this. "
"9811320","9815120"," They're highways were really interesting because they're putting in."
"9816240","9819260"," Sensors and magnets while they're building the highways."
"9819320","9819880"," Yep. "
"9820140","9823700"," Because that helps in automation of driving for us."
"9823740","9827540"," Us bureaucracy is way behind the curve right now, right?"
"9827780","9829940"," And this is why I always have said that."
"9830980","9831840"," Right, right. "
"9832220","9833180"," We need another Eisenhower."
"9833780","9838080"," We need another guy to basically say that, Hey, highways are important for national security."
"9838080","9838880"," Yes. "
"9838880","9839760"," Are we going to build them?"
"9840700","9844640"," And build them for that self driving, right?"
"9844780","9847900"," Our roads are built for non self driving."
"9848100","9849420"," They're built for a human driver."
"9850060","9850440"," Right. "
"9850720","9852120"," Our stop signs are stop lights."
"9852380","9857060"," Everything involved in our roadways are built for to go against."
"9858380","9859060"," Self driving. "
"9859920","9860480"," Right."
"9860480","9868340"," And so I am not at all surprised that there is an ascendancy in Chinese eating manufacturers."
"9869400","9873480"," So way, man, by the brute force manufacturing. "
"9874420","9879660"," Like where it's taking time for Tesla to do the money and all and just no one's on this."
"9880400","9884060"," But in China, they're like, Oh, you want to like reinvent manufacturing for EVs?"
"9884560","9885560"," We'll do it in six weeks."
"9886660","9887140"," Yeah. "
"9888620","9889880"," Throw everybody at it."
"9890800","9891880"," Throw everybody at it."
"9892020","9893100"," The government under right to low. "
"9893280","9893440"," Yeah."
"9893580","9893740"," Right."
"9893840","9894680"," It's a whole time thing, man. "
"9894960","9895240"," They don't care."
"9895540","9896920"," It's money away."
"9897640","9898120"," Yeah. "
"9898320","9900320"," It's, I mean, we did that too."
"9900740","9901340"," At one point."
"9902240","9904700"," I always remind people of Kodak. "
"9905320","9905960"," It's crazy."
"9907140","9907620"," These two."
"9907920","9908040"," Yeah. "
"9910200","9910260"," Yeah."
"9910820","9911720"," Well, the trains."
"9911720","9913560"," They stole all that tech. "
"9914220","9915360"," That was not homegrown."
"9916220","9920300"," There was a couple of German manufacturers that took them to court."
"9922040","9922920"," All of their. "
"9923680","9925160"," Do you think any of it's really their tech?"
"9925360","9927280"," I think they steal most of it or some of it."
"9927500","9930180"," And then I have met some fantastic."
"9931560","9932700"," Scientists and engineers. "
"9933640","9934400"," From China."
"9934800","9936720"," So I do not want to."
"9938780","9939180"," Yeah. "
"9939340","9939540"," Yeah."
"9939780","9939840"," Yeah."
"9940320","9941620"," People don't look at this. "
"9941760","9942760"," You know, you know this, right?"
"9943040","9943100"," Yeah."
"9943100","9947520"," The child does not look down on replication of other thoughts, either."
"9947600","9947860"," Oh, yeah. "
"9948000","9948340"," No, no."
"9948560","9950080"," It's a very simple ethos."
"9950680","9951040"," Yeah. "
"9951160","9952200"," It's a very simple ethos."
"9952480","9954480"," You do everything you do to be successful."
"9954880","9957760"," And if that includes by hook or by crook, that is fine. "
"9958020","9960080"," Because if you don't do it, I'm just doing it."
"9960280","9962200"," It's added into your like ham smart."
"9962600","9963820"," It's like they're dumb or anything. "
"9964020","9964580"," They're smart people."
"9965060","9969220"," But if someone else has done any of this work, we want access to it as well to further it."
"9970260","9973300"," Whereas the US is like, no, or maybe Western. "
"9975300","9977420"," Society is like, oh, this person owns this."
"9978820","9980760"," Concept for a set amount of time."
"9981300","9985500"," Or you can't use it or replicate it or it's great your own methodology, right?"
"9985880","9988020"," Or this monetization of it. "
"9989260","9989620"," Right."
"9990300","9990340"," Yeah."
"9990700","9993260"," So by the way, if you're a bull, this is where you buy the debt. "
"9993260","9993460"," Yep."
"9994440","9997480"," If you're if you don't know that, we're on the gamma flip right now."
"9997560","9998420"," This is where you buy the dip. "
"9998600","9998920"," You're a bull."
"9999640","10003540"," If we start to break below the gamma flip and reject off of it, you're selling the rip."
"10004620","10005580"," Fairly simple, right?"
"10005920","10007420"," Above the gamma above the gamma flip. "
"10007480","10009360"," When we come down into it, you buy the dip."
"10009840","10013220"," If we go underneath it and start rejecting, you're starting to sell the rip from there."
"10014620","10017620"," You know, it's kind of like a simple crayon rule. "
"10019320","10020560"," For you, just heads up out there."
"10020560","10024420"," If you're like, if you're scared right now of buying the dip here, even if you put a stop"
"10024420","10025060"," underneath it."
"10026260","10030520"," Now, maybe that dip that you're buying is the pivot down below here, but just be just be conscious"
"10030520","10034900"," that if you are a bull, this is the place where you're looking to enter a trade. "
"10037420","10040320"," It might be after you get above this bear cross or something."
"10040380","10041780"," You can use that if you want."
"10041860","10046140"," I'm not saying buy a dip here either, but this is the general area where you buy in a debt. "
"10047320","10047720"," Right."
"10048780","10052900"," Let me check one other thing that I have access to."
"10056560","10056920"," So. "
"10058440","10059040"," Right."
"10059340","10059900"," You're a bear."
"10060080","10060720"," You're looking for. "
"10061760","10066460"," The break of the gamma flip and then a rejection to take that short right there, I guess."
"10067140","10068100"," We're not there yet."
"10068360","10069200"," So the. "
"10071260","10076420"," So the most active put right now is 10 points below us."
"10077340","10079600"," I can check if there's some calls right now, too."
"10080120","10080520"," Yeah. "
"10081200","10084600"," And I can check that on spot as well."
"10085260","10090640"," But the most voluminous contract."
"10091680","10092440"," Is. "
"10093680","10096060"," Is 25 points above us."
"10096400","10097180"," That's the hot call."
"10097520","10106540"," 25 points above us 38,000 plus in call volume at 4770. "
"10107680","10108160"," Yeah."
"10108440","10109820"," Work saying that too right now."
"10109980","10110080"," Okay. "
"10110440","10110500"," Continue."
"10110620","10110960"," Keep talking."
"10111780","10114180"," No, I mean, that's just positioning wise. "
"10114380","10117900"," Like that's what I see right now happening in the market."
"10119800","10122740"," Works making a comment here saying home grown or not."
"10122900","10124700"," They build on top of existing tech and seem. "
"10126280","10128960"," To make leaps and strides by being more open."
"10130260","10131160"," Yeah, there's."
"10131580","10132640"," I agree with you, Bork. "
"10133440","10134080"," There's some."
"10134080","10139600"," Well, it's like such a fucking complicated mess talking about China right with."
"10140200","10141880"," Like they're what's open. "
"10144790","10150250"," You still have like state run or interference and where profit goes."
"10151290","10155790"," Like the hand and that reinvestment of that tech and all that stuff, whether that's good or bad."
"10156110","10156650"," I understand. "
"10157850","10158990"," I get your point to."
"10159710","10160170"," I should say."
"10161910","10164550"," So my trading strategy is very common share. "
"10164830","10166010"," That's a good way of saying it."
"10166010","10169730"," H bomb saying the Western government is built on exploiting the many and protecting the individual"
"10169730","10171510"," who happens to invent something."
"10171630","10172430"," That's a good way to say it too. "
"10172990","10173330"," Yeah."
"10176080","10177200"," But that's what needs to be."
"10177700","10178380"," Thanks, Camille. "
"10178820","10180200"," Hey, it looks who's in here."
"10180380","10183040"," Vol signals and vol signals is here today."
"10183200","10184340"," We were pumping you up earlier. "
"10184340","10185120"," Vol signals."
"10186140","10187700"," He's on YouTube right now."
"10188380","10189440"," He's on YouTube, man. "
"10189440","10191940"," So vol signals is here in the audience right now."
"10192240","10192720"," Vol signals."
"10193000","10193940"," We were pumping you up earlier. "
"10194120","10194940"," I apologize, man."
"10195240","10195800"," We're talking."
"10196120","10196980"," We're talking good about it. "
"10197120","10197460"," He deserves it."
"10197740","10198540"," He deserves it."
"10198720","10203120"," He is seriously the amount of knowledge that man has dropped on me. "
"10203560","10207380"," Like in the last two, two and a half months and being so supportive."
"10207380","10209860"," Like I cannot pump him up enough."
"10210540","10212000"," This is podcast, by the way. "
"10212480","10213000"," Sarson."
"10213000","10213640"," Yeah."
"10213800","10214240"," So yeah. "
"10214340","10215340"," Trader podcast is here."
"10215400","10215760"," Vol signals."
"10215920","10218520"," If you're here right now, Trader podcast is in the studio with us today. "
"10219160","10223160"," If you guys don't know who he is, we get dropped his name in the chats on both Twitch and"
"10223160","10223720"," YouTube earlier."
"10224280","10225560"," He is here right now."
"10225620","10228520"," Let's see what he has to say about the market from a gamma perspective. "
"10229140","10230360"," He's saying buyer beware."
"10231220","10232220"," Mind your timing."
"10232740","10235600"," Should have some stick stickiness through tomorrow. "
"10236040","10237200"," Am op X at least."
"10238700","10239700"," What's going on, man?"
"10240000","10240580"," Good to see you brother."
"10241500","10241980"," Yeah. "
"10242120","10242940"," We're pumping you up, dude."
"10244140","10245660"," Of a Twitter podcast."
"10245860","10247280"," We're going to talk about Vol signals one more time. "
"10247420","10248900"," Maybe rehash it a little bit while you like him."
"10249240","10249700"," Yeah."
"10249880","10249960"," Yeah. "
"10250280","10254060"," So, uh, Vol signals is has been."
"10254520","10262540"," So you can follow him on Twitter at, at, at Vol signals and, um, he's been, you know, really"
"10262540","10267860"," instrumental in highlighting some of the big trades that have happened over the last year."
"10267860","10269980"," Like he was the first one I know that. "
"10270380","10271640"," You know, alerted."
"10272140","10274740"," Pretty much all of Fintuit to the."
"10275340","10277700"," I broke her interactive brokers will. "
"10278160","10281720"," You know, this is a retail trader with a lot of scratch."
"10282120","10288620"," Because they're using I wrote, uh, interactive brokers and they routinely put in."
"10289220","10294420"," Millions of dollars into SPX spreads one way or the other, or sometimes straight. "
"10294420","10298000"," It puts a straight calls and they have pretty much."
"10298780","10306020"," Um, you know, dictated where the market ends up going, whether they're dictating it or whether, uh,"
"10306240","10310180"," you know, they are really good at recognizing a pivot and capitalizing on it."
"10310300","10313040"," Cause they've had an incredible hit rate. "
"10313380","10318500"," So, Vol signals was the first one to highlight that and, and many, many other trades."
"10319320","10321600"," That I have seen he has his own discord."
"10321600","10328120"," Um, and it is full of intelligent people who trade volatility. "
"10329080","10334280"," Uh, and some good, some really sophisticated strategies and, you know, eco."
"10334820","10336440"," Money from this market."
"10336700","10338360"," I know he himself was in a bank trade. "
"10339780","10342460"," And, um, yeah, I cannot."
"10342880","10347380"," And the amount of knowledge he's dropped on me on Twitter on explaining how."
"10347380","10352020"," The interaction of dealer positioning market structure. "
"10352640","10358400"," And price action can provide an edge one way or the other if you're taking a position."
"10358720","10363680"," So I cannot say enough good things about Vol signals."
"10364260","10365420"," And I'm glad he's here. "
"10365660","10366000"," He deserves."
"10366560","10370960"," And he's got some bangers in here that reinforce what we were talking about earlier in the show."
"10371480","10375540"," Uh, he's saying the, uh, this window here corporate buybacks closed for now. "
"10375540","10378520"," CTA triggers dragging up near the money as momentum fades."
"10379240","10381100"," This is like a dealer negative gamma."
"10381880","10386860"," Uh, he's saying you have a January long gamma rolling off and behind it. "
"10386980","10389380"," There's a lot of quote unquote traditional hedging."
"10389760","10395920"," Think JPM caller type stuff through March concentrated and also arguably June."
"10396840","10400700"," Uh, watching for sentiment to get spooked if we keep getting bounced off the highs. "
"10401420","10404820"," Uh, trade podcast is the local celebrity in the discord."
"10404960","10405580"," Hell yeah."
"10407640","10411900"," We're going to get ball signals on the show here at some point too and get his voice on the"
"10411900","10412700"," stream at some point. "
"10413180","10414600"," Try to schedule him to stop in."
"10415140","10416080"," Uh, trade podcasts."
"10416320","10417420"," You want to, I need to take a break. "
"10417560","10418200"," I got to go potty."
"10418760","10423200"," Um, do you want to wrap this up or say anything else or, um."
"10423900","10424900"," Yeah, let's wrap it up. "
"10425180","10426200"," Um, I, I."
"10426200","10430540"," Anybody out there questions for him want to thank him for coming on the show and spending his"
"10430540","10431160"," morning with us."
"10431700","10434480"," Uh, this is the time he's still here right now."
"10437120","10438440"," I think they've heard me enough. "
"10438700","10440140"," I am not as exciting as you are."
"10441820","10442220"," So."
"10443300","10446320"," Anyways, yeah, people right now, they're thinking inside Twitch inside. "
"10446640","10449660"," Uh, we got John, John H for timing in on yelling."
"10450540","10451140"," Old yellow."
"10454140","10458360"," Yeah, man, I want to thank you for coming on this morning and, uh, given that detailed analysis and"
"10458360","10459000"," ball signals. "
"10459000","10463680"," The saying some of the same stuff are all the same stuff that we're talking about all morning here."
"10464380","10467240"," Uh, so ball signals, let me ask you a question."
"10467340","10469940"," Are you expecting you're in the stream with us right now?"
"10470420","10476440"," Uh, do you expect, um, some of this weakness to restart again into Friday and Monday heading into"
"10476440","10477340"," the end of January?"
"10477980","10483020"," Uh, and if so, or you're expecting, um, any kind of significant downside move or it's a more like"
"10483020","10484160"," 470 ish. "
"10484160","10489100"," Um, or is it possible to hit that 464 50 the downside?"
"10493960","10495800"," Yeah, definitely ball signals, definitely."
"10496820","10504600"," Uh, maybe we can have ball if you've had time tomorrow, man."
"10504860","10508300"," If you want to come on for a Friday tomorrow, probably a good day to have yawn, actually. "
"10509020","10514480"," Uh, as we have two minus 290 or something like that for a fall on single tickers fall off tomorrow"
"10514480","10515140"," or SBX."
"10515140","10518000"," I think 290 m or something falling off tomorrow."
"10520980","10522040"," Let me get him on the show. "
"10522220","10522760"," We'll have to ask him."
"10524650","10525030"," Yeah."
"10525310","10526710"," Um, I'll reach out to him. "
"10526710","10527370"," I'll talk to him."
"10527590","10527790"," Cool."
"10527870","10530450"," And I'm, and I'm needle him to, to get on the thing. "
"10530570","10535150"," He might be not keen on sharing his voice, but, um."
"10535530","10537590"," Yeah, he's also saying he's got a, I think it would be a break."
"10538270","10539090"," 4675 on the S."
"10539290","10542550"," We have risk to run to 4400 until Henry versus. "
"10544090","10544470"," Yeah."
"10544470","10544550"," Yeah."
"10545230","10549590"," Yeah, he did somebody out like there's a big trade that came in. "
"10549850","10551990"," I think yesterday that reflected that positioning too."
"10552070","10554770"," I saw the VIX trade and the V VIX stuff."
"10555330","10559610"," Uh, there's a lot of people out there betting on that VIX. "
"10560770","10561190"," Right."
"10563910","10567110"," As I said, one of the best things you can do for an intraday trader."
"10568610","10570930"," Is you can look at VIX, VIX. "
"10570930","10574470"," But what I have right now on my screen."
"10574770","10577050"," Let me check my DMS, I guess."
"10577710","10582670"," As the, uh, the, the, I have spy on and I have Dixie. "
"10583090","10584610"," That that's what I'm looking at."
"10584910","10588850"," And I think the dollar and yields are running the show."
"10589510","10590050"," Right now. "
"10590090","10594050"," And that's why I think the next, you know, 30 minutes with the 10 year option."
"10594790","10599630"," We'll determine if he flushed today or if we basically go and retest."
"10599630","10600410"," All right. "
"10600410","10601510"," So we're not going to hold you this."
"10601610","10606250"," Do you think we're squeezing that, uh, the T and X to the moon right now so we can flush"
"10606250","10606730"," it or no."
"10609460","10610260"," Bloodbath and coming. "
"10610540","10617960"," I can't make a call because it all really depends on how well that, uh, that that auction goes."
"10618280","10622040"," If that auction goes well, we're squeezing everywhere out of the market today."
"10622720","10623800"," Everybody's in a big cover. "

"11524660","11525640"," for it first where you have. "
"11526060","11533580"," I have a ETF DBB this is a base metals ETF the contrarian idea being everybody thinks inflation is"
"11533580","11538080"," coming down in a linear fashion what if it goes back up what if we see a resurgence because the"
"11538080","11544280"," Fed cuts too soon and add on to that what if housing doesn't collapse like people are expecting it"
"11544280","11549060"," to and come out of inflation as mortgage rates fall I think you see more demand for housing which"
"11549060","11550760"," drives things like copper prices."
"11551400","11556580"," So this ETF and just metals in general aside from gold has done pretty poorly this year was pretty"
"11556580","11560720"," poor at the end of last year so watch it for maybe a little pop higher but to be clear"
"11560720","11564900"," this is a satellite allocation in a portfolio this should not be your entire alternatives"
"11564900","11566440"," allocation keep it tiny."
"11566800","11568260"," Good qualifier for DBB. "
"11568520","11569160"," What do you got Bill?"
"11569380","11574880"," I promise this was not played at all."
"11575940","11581240"," Platinum and Palladium and to your point they were bludging last year this thing was down 25% last"
"11581240","11581540"," year."
"11582080","11587020"," I'm looking at a resurgence in China I think that as well if you look at the China exports of"
"11587020","11590360"," autos they're going to dethrone Japan that's what the call is here. "
"11590740","11594060"," If China picks up we're going to see platinum and palladium I mean they're using Cadillac"
"11594060","11595820"," converters I think it's just really crush."

"11601800","11605820"," just started the year off very very poorly so you're looking at it here as really I think a good"
"11605820","11606140"," entry."
"11606480","11610620"," Now if you're going to get into commodities you have to understand the volatility of commodities"
"11611060","11614900"," even if it's an ETF of commodities so make sure you know what you're doing if you're buying this"
"11614900","11618180"," there's going to be a lot of volatility behind it but it's something that's bludgeoned and I think"
"11618180","11621740"," there's a good reason for turning around I mean even just like infrastructure in the U.S. to start"
"11621740","11625840"," the spending that's just going to keep going around and I think China's going to be the cornerstone"
"11625840","11626220"," here. "

"11632220","11636540"," Well coming up the committee's got more portfolio ideas for the year but first Mike Santoli will"
"11636540","11639780"," join us with his midday word halftime report back right after this. "
"11787220","11790880"," So in some of the time now we do the 10 year tips so the U.S. selling 18 billion"
"11790880","11795930"," dollars of 10 year tips for the private cover of two spot three two and a prior high yield of"
"11795930","11797110"," two spot one eight percent."
"11797710","11811570"," With his"
"11811570","11816570"," midday word you still got the NASDAQ leading in the S&P positive but it does seem like we've lost"
"11816570","11818790"," a little bit of wind from the sales of the market here today."
"11819090","11820350"," Is it treasury yields Mike?"
"11820530","11824910"," Yeah of course some days pretty much moment to moment the market tells you what it's paying"
"11824910","11830430"," attention to so the highs for the morning in the S&P 500 were made just as the 10 year"
"11830430","11834830"," treasury yield started that run up to four fifteen it's just like a you know so just taking a look"
"11834830","11839070"," at the preview for this option the positive for the sale include large anticipated monthly index"
"11839070","11845490"," extensions potential for near term upside pressure on inflation from trade disruptions and the Fed"
"11845490","11846790"," shift towards rate cut. "
"11847210","11852990"," So other negatives include its increased size and somewhat rich valuations on the U.S. G."
"11853270","11858730"," Morgan strategist the primary dealer positions in tips to six to eleven years was net long two spot"
"11858730","11861830"," eight seven billion dollars in the weekend of January 3rd."
"11861830","11865630"," A third spot six billion average net long over the past year."
"11865850","11870710"," After a sprint to two year highs at the end of last year but getting a little bit of anxiety"
"11870710","11874390"," in there as below the surface you're seeing some deeper pullbacks. "
"11874930","11879170"," All right thank you very much Mike for joining us and keeping us on track coming up next trade"
"11879170","11879490"," school."
"11879770","11884250"," It's in session that committee debate some of the most unloved stocks and which ones could be good"
"11884250","11885970"," bets for the year ahead half time is right back."
"12042230","12044390"," We're back on half time time for trade school. "
"12044590","12048370"," Josh you're breaking down some of the most unloved stocks in the NASDAQ 100."
"12048710","12051270"," This is where you get to explain and teach us what you're thinking."
"12051670","12057710"," So the general idea is in any huge market rally there are always going to be companies that have"
"12057710","12058270"," been left behind. "
"12058750","12062910"," A lot of people are saying to themselves like all right the NASDAQ's up fifty percent last year."
"12063110","12063570"," What do I do?"
"12063990","12065970"," How do I buy a stock that just went up a hundred percent?"
"12066130","12070310"," It's really hard to do and sometimes it's worth doing that but not always."
"12071170","12075870"," On the flip side sometimes it's worth looking at some of the stocks that have not participated. "
"12076330","12078450"," Where they got that rug just set up right now."
"12078590","12079370"," How do you see that rug?"
"12079590","12082130"," The first is these are severely impaired."
"12082470","12086810"," So far from this time now we're going to be paying attention to the US selling 18 billion dollars. "
"12087410","12091530"," Private cover is two spot free suit and a prior yield of two spot one eight percent."
"12091750","12096010"," They can change in most cases that might all of a sudden resonate with investors."
"12096770","12102730"," So we looked at the worst performers in the NASDAQ 100 and we were looking for names where they"
"12102730","12106190"," were either in technology consumer discretionary or healthcare. "
"12106810","12112130"," They were sort of in growthy areas and which ones are maybe worth a second look."
"12112290","12113630"," So I picked out a few."
"12113630","12115670"," I think Illumina is really interesting. "
"12116050","12119450"," It's healthcare technology diagnostic equipment."
"12119930","12121890"," There was an activist fight with Carl Icahn."
"12122010","12123870"," It's just been a total basket case. "
"12124270","12127390"," But I think it's worth a look because healthcare has been lagging."
"12127870","12131650"," If healthcare turns up this is the type of stock that could get rediscovered."
"12132630","12133730"," I took a look at Siri. "
"12134270","12136670"," That's the one that's down the most out of the NASDAQ 100."
"12136930","12142710"," It's down 92 percent and of course the whole thing is reliant on people continuing to pay"
"12142710","12142950"," subscriptions."
"12143810","12145290"," It's been a really challenged business. "
"12145730","12147850"," The only thing they have that's specialist Howard Stern."
"12148370","12154810"," Howard Stern is probably on not just the BAT9 but maybe the BAT2 of his radio career."
"12156590","12160710"," But again, what could change at a company like Siri?"
"12160890","12166410"," So I just think it's the type of thing where if you see the market up huge, just recognize there"
"12166410","12167870"," are companies that have been left behind. "
"12168370","12170090"," You probably don't want to own all of them."
"12170090","12175250"," But probably there were a few names in there where something is not being appreciated by the market"
"12175250","12177150"," and you maybe uncover a gem."
"12177490","12179070"," So that's the idea behind the hatefully. "
"12179390","12179950"," Very interesting."
"12180210","12181870"," And PayPal though also on your hatefully."
"12182350","12186010"," I mean it's one of the worst stocks in the history of mankind as we all know. "
"12186090","12186550"," And I know."
"12186550","12187390"," So I could not be there."
"12187490","12189450"," And we had a very interesting conversation about the early. "
"12189650","12192610"," We'll stick with us because final trades are coming up on halftime."
"12195730","12199190"," Tomorrow Scott Wopner live from the American Express."
"12199730","12202770"," Exclusive interviews with the CEOs of American Express. "

"12206890","12208730"," Tomorrow only on CNBC."
"12210750","12321430"," I'm sure"
"12321430","12322950"," they expect to need 10 years of solution. "
"12323230","12324610"," One issue to do at the top of the hour."
"12360520","12361340"," Three thirty first."
"12363700","12364900"," We're back on halftime. "
"12364900","12366500"," It's already time for the final trade."
"12366740","12367700"," This hour flew by Liz."
"12367940","12368440"," You get to go first. "
"12369020","12370320"," Health care this time."
"12370580","12374880"," At least until election season kicks into high gear and polling starts to drive volatility."
"12375380","12376320"," But you get some growth. "
"12376560","12377720"," It's not as interest rate sensitive."
"12378180","12379540"," And they were a legged last year."
"12379580","12381600"," One issue 10 year tips yield about one spot. "
"12381740","12385520"," Eight to five percent before the eighteen billion dollar auctions to just repeat are there."
"12385880","12389360"," One issue yield around one spot eight to five percent."
"12389360","12389940"," Ten year tips. "
"12389940","12391920"," A lot of the tax law selling and window dressing."
"12391920","12394580"," It's about to retest that level here."
"12395000","12395860"," I think it'll hold. "
"12395860","12396740"," I'm in the stock."
"12397060","12398240"," Relatively recent purchase."
"12398640","12399020"," You carry. "
"12399620","12400120"," I'll go fast."

"12413000","12413420"," Got it."
"12413540","12414200"," That does it for halftime. "

"12455180","12458500"," And it is not just because former President Trump is back in the picture. "
"12458960","12462420"," It is because deep things are also a part of the picture."
"12462840","12465240"," And they are getting more and more sophisticated."

"12470980","12474120"," Generally positive Tyler but losing some steam right now. "
"12474260","12477040"," It's a bit mixed in terms of the overall picture with the major indices."
"12477040","12479020"," The Dow industrials currently at about 100 points."
"12479500","12481200"," One quarter of 1% declines there. "
"12481280","12482320"," 37,168."
"12482540","12487760"," The S&P 500 that broader measure is up about one-tenth of 1% so modest gains here."

"12547760","12553020"," The second worst performer in the S&P 500 today as of right now is Discover Financial Services. "

"12658020","12659400"," This is going to be a lively conversation."
"12659760","12660140"," I'm sure."
"12660140","12662420"," Let me begin with this. "
"12662640","12667420"," It says in my description of about Ben Axler that you're an activist short seller."
"12667840","12668100"," We agree."
"12668640","12673420"," Forensic financial researchers, certainly that, who has dedicated his career to exposing financial"
"12673420","12679720"," schemes is MSCI with a blue chip background and heritage of financial scheme. "
"12680260","12680860"," And if so, why?"
"12681300","12686700"," Well, I think the company clearly is trying to create shareholder value and increase its stock"
"12686700","12687060"," price."
"12687060","12692520"," Now, where we think they've gone wrong is through expensive acquisitions that we think haven't"
"12692520","12693940"," lived up to the expectations."
"12694940","12701000"," We think they're repurchasing their stock at an industry high 17 times revenue multiple. "
"12701560","12704420"," We think that money should be dedicated more to dividends."
"12705360","12710520"," And, you know, we think that to the point about it being a mature struggling company, that they're"
"12710520","12715420"," engaging in aggressive accounting and financial reporting to project an image of growth, where we"
"12715420","12720060"," think, ultimately, they're going to struggle to meet expectations as the industry transforms and"
"12720060","12721220"," their solutions become more compromised."
"12721600","12722840"," These are operational largely. "
"12723260","12725400"," Let me, let me, that's my characterization, not yours."
"12725800","12730840"," Operational issues, how the company is being run, what it has done in terms of acquisitions, how it"
"12730840","12732900"," is handling share repurchases versus dividends."
"12733360","12736660"," And so these are legitimate criticisms, I'm sure, from where you sit. "
"12737080","12738240"," But is it a scheme?"
"12739120","12743100"," Well, I think every company operates a scheme to improve their share price, right?"
"12743100","12748900"," But I think where we believe that management is being aggressive in terms of how they're portraying"
"12748900","12752840"," their growth, how they're portraying their margins, and how they're depicting their revenue."
"12753320","12760060"," So, for example, in our report, we noted we've seen some aggressive revenue recognition policies on"
"12760060","12761900"," non-recurring revenue items."
"12762480","12767080"," We also have issues about the cost allocations and whether or not the margins and certain segments"
"12767080","12767460"," are increasing. "
"12768520","12774640"," One of the bones you have picked with the company, as we talk about revenue recognition and things"
"12774640","12780300"," like that, is the fact that the chief accounting officer left about six months ago, am I right on"
"12780300","12780440"," that?"
"12780980","12786980"," Has not been replaced, is being, the job is now being functionally covered by the chief financial"
"12786980","12790440"," officer, you think this is bad."
"12791240","12793460"," Yeah, so we do have concerns about the government."
"12793460","12795180"," And the comptroller has gone, right?"
"12795320","12796000"," There's no comptroller. "
"12796180","12796400"," Correct."
"12796740","12798900"," So there's some governance improvements that we think could be made."
"12799380","12803260"," Look, we credit the CEO who's been with the business since 2007. "
"12803360","12804740"," He's created a lot of value."
"12804740","12805440"," He's also the chairman."
"12806140","12810960"," But we think as the companies and markets and customers change that the company needs some change"
"12810960","12814280"," at the highest level at the CEO level. "
"12814380","12818540"," In addition, we believe the company should split the CFO and chief accounting officer roles."
"12818980","12819580"," That's a concern."
"12819580","12825040"," We also have a concern about the audit engagement partner who is not explicitly a financial service"
"12825040","12828380"," or technology expert is a chemical and industrial expert. "
"12828640","12833360"," So we think there's certain things they should do to improve the governance and the competence in"
"12833360","12834920"," the company's financial reporting."
"12835120","12840920"," Governance, operations, another thing you draw attention to from your point of view is what you"
"12840920","12843480"," call nepotistic tendencies."
"12845680","12852640"," And nepotistic, I guess, in personnel decisions in terms of acquisitions and other things. "
"12852820","12859480"," Explain where the nepotistic factors have come into play and why they've been injurious to the"
"12859480","12859680"," company."
"12859920","12860040"," Right."
"12860340","12862280"," So MSCI, what does it stand for?"
"12862520","12865080"," Morgan Stanley Capital International. "
"12865080","12873340"," I just heads up here that I just bought for 60 cents, 475 C for tomorrow."
"12874260","12875540"," 475 C."
"12877160","12880600"," Not releasing the terms, the payments of what's being made to these individuals."
"12880600","12887140"," So we're calling on the company to be more transparent and explain why there is a pattern of deal"
"12887140","12890660"," making nepotism like alliances with these individuals. "
"12891400","12893480"," Probably not the best place for me to do it this far."
"12893820","12900340"," Let's see how it goes here to get rolled down some more allegations sent in a letter yesterday to"
"12900340","12904660"," Wayne Edmonds, who's the independent board chair and audit committee chairman at MSCI."
"12906500","12912680"," Just close the gap on SPX report called that MSCI is a struggling company misguided. "
"12912680","12916360"," We view MSCI as one of the highest quality franchises in our coverage."
"12916740","12921900"," We believe the report mischaracterizes MSCI's leading market position and under appreciates its"
"12921900","12923760"," high return subscription based model."
"12924100","12929340"," We highlight spruce points recent track record with other high quality multiple business services"
"12929340","12932460"," stocks with average performance of positive 73%. "
"12932460","12936600"," 38% out performance versus market since the short call."
"12936980","12941700"," What they are fundamentally saying there is that they don't agree with your assessment of MSCI."
"12941920","12947600"," And oh, by the way, just to pound pound you a little harder, when you've made short calls in the"
"12947600","12949620"," past, the stock has done the opposite. "
"12949860","12950780"," It has gone up, not down."
"12951260","12952460"," Well, we disagree with that."
"12952520","12956120"," I mean, you look at our recent track record of S&P 500 short campaigns. "
"12956120","12961060"," Last year, we called short on Xylem within a month, the CFO and CEO resigned."
"12961600","12966900"," We've had a lot of traction in some of these large cap companies and we're looking very much at the"
"12966900","12967220"," numbers."
"12967580","12967580"," Okay. "
"12967980","12969920"," So, you know, our report is very fact based."
"12970280","12974080"," You can look at the client retention rate of MSCI across their segments."
"12974420","12974780"," They're all declining. "
"12975520","12976560"," The organic growth is declining."
"12977380","12981180"," The company is making changes to their risk factor language and the 10K."
"12981940","12983520"," Talking about client defections. "
"12983680","12988560"," We even did a survey about 1% of their clients and are finding that the customers are pushing back"
"12988560","12990560"," on abusive high price increases."
"12990940","12991940"," So we beg to differ there."
"12992060","12994900"," Other shorts you've had lately, A.O. Smith and Generac. "
"12995060","12995940"," Let me ask you this."
"12996560","13001780"," You're critical of the amount of share buybacks at the companies."
"13001980","13004760"," Is that a fair characterization of what you're doing?"
"13005520","13010420"," Are those share buybacks, do you believe, driven in part?"
"13010420","13016900"," By the fact that executives at the company are heavily compensated with stock. "
"13017340","13018800"," You hit the nail on the head."
"13018980","13024140"," So one of our issues here is that management long term incentive compensation is being tied to"
"13024140","13026880"," cumulative revenue and a just DPS."
"13027300","13028200"," Well, what's the problem here?"
"13028700","13032360"," The company does not give explicit guidance on their revenue or just DPS. "
"13032360","13034780"," So investors are operating in a vacuum."
"13034980","13040400"," Management's paying on numbers and yet they're not disclosing what these metrics are to understand."
"13040800","13043160"," We talked about that ticker this morning. "
"13043160","13046160"," We used the buyback in a way that increases earnings per share."
"13046400","13050920"," So one can think of it as they're essentially buying their potential ability to hit the targets."
"13051820","13056380"," And they will adjust out modifications to the debt in terms of adjusted use. "
"13056560","13060200"," But why not adjust out the repurchases in the adjusted DPS?"
"13060200","13061700"," So that's our main criticism."
"13061800","13063660"," So let me ask you one."
"13063800","13064360"," We have to go. "
"13064660","13066380"," But how the hell do they make money?"
"13067540","13069140"," Well, they have an index business."
"13069400","13074720"," Would they license those indexes to funds and ETFs and what do they have?"
"13075020","13075060"," Correct."
"13075080","13075260"," Yeah. "
"13075400","13077140"," So they have an index business and analytics business."
"13077320","13080500"," But their core growth driver recently has been their ESG ratings business."
"13080860","13082260"," That's been growing about 20%. "
"13082260","13087060"," And where our real concern is that that growth driver business is starting to slow as there's ESG"
"13087060","13088060"," pushback and more competition."
"13088060","13095020"," So the ESG rating a company will pay them to rate the company on ESG metrics."
"13095420","13101100"," Is that like the way S&P might charge a company to go in and give it a bond rating?"
"13101360","13102280"," That's absolutely correct. "
"13102500","13104180"," That's their highest value ESG business."
"13104480","13105740"," And that is under more pressure."
"13106120","13106300"," Interesting. "
"13106600","13108200"," Thank you so much, Ben Axel."
"13108460","13109300"," We appreciate your time."
"13109780","13115680"," And obviously we have a standing invitation out to MSCI and their executives to join us to comment"
"13115680","13117400"," on this call. "
"13117400","13118220"," Thank you very much."
"13118340","13119400"," Thank you very much, Ben."
"13119760","13125120"," Market probabilities for a March rate cut coming down a bit, now sitting at 57%. "
"13125120","13130140"," Our next guest agrees with that sentiment, saying a cut that soon would be too aggressive."
"13130640","13133300"," You see some choppiness ahead for the markets in several areas."
"13133440","13134480"," I'm up a penny right now. "
"13134540","13138120"," To strike on the strike on amid the pullbacks."
"13138400","13139280"," That'll pay right now."
"13139280","13142980"," Let's bring in Matt Orton, Chief at Market Strategist at Raymond James Investment Management. "
"13143500","13144240"," Matt, welcome."
"13144400","13144940"," Good to have you with us."
"13146260","13147500"," Great to be here, Tyler. "
"13147680","13153700"," You don't argue with the fundamental thesis that the Fed is likelier to loosen rates this year than"
"13153700","13154740"," not, right?"
"13154980","13159380"," But you just are questioning whether the timing in March is too soon."
"13161020","13162460"," Yeah, that's absolutely right."
"13163100","13166980"," It's clear that the Fed has hit the peak that we're going to be cutting rates this year. "
"13166980","13172360"," The problem is the market got really, really aggressive, Tyler, in pricing and rate cuts."
"13172820","13178380"," Pricing in six rate cuts at the start of the year and putting up to an 80% probability that"
"13178380","13179940"," we're going to get a cut in March."
"13180340","13184540"," But at the same time, you have an economic backdrop that's pretty darn positive. "
"13184540","13185960"," You have strong jobs growth."
"13186640","13193400"," I think the trajectory to get to consistent 2% inflation target is not as easy as everyone thought."
"13194240","13198860"," I've been telling a lot of our clients that we've got to go through some normalization first. "
"13199360","13201300"," We're seeing that play it a little bit this week."
"13201340","13203040"," I think there's still more room to go."
"13203380","13207440"," But at the end of the day, the fundamental backdrop supporting earnings growth and supporting a"
"13207440","13210440"," broadening of the market is still very much in place. "
"13210840","13216020"," So what I say is use downside opportunistically to diversify and set your portfolios."
"13216560","13220320"," And if you've got cash sitting on the sidelines, rates are going to come down."
"13220320","13225200"," So have a plan and start to execute that plan because there's plenty of interesting areas in the"
"13225200","13225500"," market. "
"13225780","13229440"," I guess one of the things that I may be full of it here, Matt."
"13229620","13231440"," And you can instruct me if I am."
"13231620","13234040"," And I admit I'm full of it more often than not. "
"13234840","13239520"," Is the idea that there's a little bit of a roll, but not quite still strong right here."
"13239620","13240000"," Right, Johnny?"
"13240460","13245740"," This tonnage sitting there in money market funds and indeed money did go into money market funds"
"13245740","13248600"," over the last year as rates rose."
"13248600","13253280"," And the returns on those funds became more palatable, more more enticing. "
"13253700","13255820"," Come on, T-N-X roll, baby."
"13257140","13259320"," Passless still blasting down here."
"13259760","13259960"," Leave. "
"13260620","13263180"," The VIX trade in $14.79 right now."
"13263200","13264600"," A big rise in equities."
"13264820","13266380"," Tell me I'm wrong to be skeptical. "
"13268200","13268720"," No, Tyler."
"13268980","13273640"," I think you're right to be skeptical because you've always seen me leave those short-term"
"13273640","13273920"," instruments."
"13273920","13274360"," Yeah. "
"13274800","13281080"," What I would say is you have to think about why $1.2 trillion went into money market."
"13281080","13283300"," Man, they're going to roll H-Y-V down here."
"13283480","13286100"," H-Y-V gets saucy right now. "
"13286440","13287820"," Dixie looking kind of weak."
"13288580","13290180"," H-Y-V looking weak."
"13290360","13291420"," Dixie looking weakish. "
"13291840","13294840"," And then another big part of that was rates are continuing to increase."
"13294840","13296880"," Nasdaq bleeding, T-N-X strong."
"13297640","13302140"," I can get five or four or five percent to last money in a safe place. "
"13302140","13307820"," And that doesn't sound too bad to me after an era when I was getting zero percent."
"13307820","13308500"," I don't know what to do."
"13309360","13312020"," I'm going to put a stop here in case I get rough. "
"13312220","13314040"," But then look at what has changed now."
"13314300","13319920"," So those who went into those money market funds who were overweight, they missed out on the capital"
"13319920","13324880"," appreciation component that you can get both with respect to fixed income and equities."
"13325500","13327260"," And a lot of them said, OK, at five percent. "
"13327440","13328300"," It might go a little bit higher."
"13328300","13328840"," I'm going to wait."
"13329120","13330800"," And now we went down to four percent. "
"13330800","13332740"," And so I think there's."
"13332740","13333680"," I got to stop, Elise."
"13333960","13337260"," The eight one comes, parties take 618. "
"13337620","13340560"," And I think at the same time, $2, $3, $4 billion that's just worth sitting there."
"13340580","13341440"," Who are there?"
"13341500","13341640"," Who are there?"
"13342180","13345160"," Or the I need income part of the equation?"
"13345860","13346960"," They can get that in stocks."
"13347240","13348440"," They can get that in bonds now. "
"13348600","13349600"," And as rates are coming down."
"13350140","13355600"," I believe you're going to see that money start to move, especially when the economic picture is"
"13355600","13357020"," still pretty benign and solid."
"13357020","13361680"," I don't want to let you go without a quick thumbnail on a couple of the stocks you like they"
"13361680","13367140"," are contrarian in some cases though One of them the first one I'm going to mention I'm hearing a"
"13367140","13374540"," lot of buzz about lately And that is UNH of the big health care company XBI and biotech L3 Harris"
"13374540","13375760"," defense and small caps. "
"13376040","13377100"," Why do you like these?"
"13377960","13384400"," Tell me what you really like health care is a great opportunity to play because your health care"
"13384400","13392000"," put the DTFs out there that have Down for two straight years It's just like bloodbathing the race"
"13392000","13401120"," all of their games It's because they missed expectations Pretty badly and the outlook isn't that"
"13401120","13406480"," positive whereas you have a UNH that's growing it, you know, 13% earnings You're over here."
"13406480","13411780"," Yeah, I reposted that from Andy constant on Twitter So my profile is great."
"13411880","13417560"," I would be using this downside to build more of a position there and XBI Even though biotech Tyler"
"13417560","13422640"," has had such a big run and people might be reticent to put money to work there Take a five "
"13422640","13428300","-year chart of XBI and look at the destruction that has happened In the environment where rates"
"13428300","13429180"," started to move higher. "
"13429760","13434620"," We know from our conversation earlier rates are going to come down this year PNX rolling over right"
"13434620","13439420"," now, especially down market cap has picked up and should continue to accelerate PNX bleeding"
"13439420","13444580"," There's a lot of patent clips coming up and so you're seeing a lot of pharma companies be much more"
"13444580","13446860"," inquisitive And I think there's a lot of room to run."
"13447040","13451660"," So don't play the binary event play XBI to get broad exposure Gotta leave it there Matt."
"13451660","13452480"," Thank you very much. "
"13452480","13453040"," Matt Orton."
"13453280","13456080"," We appreciate your time today Raymond James Thank you."

"13833510","13838910"," I'm a dip buyer here to head to the upside, right If we bounce right here, I'm still a dip"
"13838910","13840670"," buyer right here, right bull."
"13840910","13845410"," I'm a bull down here Um Is my point i'm not a bull up here."

"13867030","13867550"," Do you know what i'm saying?"
"13867870","13872930"," Now if we we now if we do reject here if we're like, uh, you know what cap Uh, this"
"13872930","13874490"," was your dip and I buy it."
"13874610","13881050"," Yeah, I bought it here Perfect trade we come up here and then we reject the downside Uh, i'm going"

"13882530","13888750"," I'm going to stop being a dip buyer and turn into a rips or a sell the ripper Um And"
"13888750","13894070"," as a matter of fact close we get into friday the more The more crispier it's going to become More"
"13894070","13899830"," dangerous it is to be doing this because I know it's some point here that as that gamma rolls off"
"13899830","13906290"," and those single tickers expire That we're going to end up getting We're going to end up getting um"
"13907090","13913830"," Some some window of weakness risk to the downside Uh, so right now just parked right here sitting"
"13913830","13914970"," around seeing what's going on. "
"13915110","13915790"," That's why I bought it."
"13916010","13917390"," I shouldn't have bought it It was risky."
"13917830","13918410"," It's cheap though. "
"13918450","13924410"," It's like for tomorrow Down to pennies right now and uh, let's see what happens if we get below"
"13924410","13938550"," like 50 cents 40 cents something like that I'll cut it loose Become a seller I"
"13938550","13942870"," Am I'm with the I'm with the uh, I'm with like if you're a bull It's kind of it's like"

"13946210","13947450"," Actually, you can see right now."
"13947550","13953810"," We're turning into so you can see the sellers stepping in right here Trying to start a breakthrough"
"13953810","13965430"," support The rug pulling this right now we may get some blood right now I Remember"
"13965430","13970510"," like when you're buying all you guys remember something when you're out there buying like, um A lot"
"13970510","13974610"," of you guys buy like the run already happens then you're buying the top and you feel good."
"13974610","13975510"," It feels good, right?"
"13976030","13977970"," This doesn't feel good to me buying here. "
"13978430","13983570"," It goes like it goes against your grain To buy it if you're even if you lose it doesn't feel"
"13983570","13989390"," like I should buy it if I should see some Um progress before I buy so it's pretty risky what"
"13989390","13993110"," I'm doing right now Are they gonna rug pull us?"
"13993210","13998190"," I don't know I feel more coming the other side of my my lizard brain there Tells me that if"
"13998190","14002270"," if I am going to put this risk on in a risky environment, I'd rather do it here than as"
"14002270","14009890"," we're fucking uh, straight green barring it up I feel most like I don't think that's like a inverse"
"14011750","14020170"," relationship Exactly, Joe best trades often feel the worst And I can lose this easily Uh, like none"
"14020170","14024970"," of the none of the things that we use around here to buy a dip with confidence I'm buying a"
"14024970","14034120"," dip with no confidence right now Yeah, we can still swing down a little bit more Uh, it's always"
"14034120","14035080"," risky down here, right?"
"14035240","14046100"," Or so you're always like panicky or not you but me Deep fakes for the election Uh, I"
"14046100","14051840"," don't think we're quite there yet, but we will be We will be the real fear here."
"14052020","14058720"," I gotta tell you guys that the real fear here If you had a real fear for this election It"
"14058720","14067720"," is, um I was talking about this briefly the other day I'm going to tell you guys what the uh"
"14069620","14080220"," Real danger is out there right now I was on google news You"
"14080220","14090200"," can do this yourself It's so fascinating So I was on google news And in the bottom"
"14090200","14098860"," of google news on a desktop during chrome chrome browser and you look at google news At the bottom"
"14098860","14108760"," of their news They have a section where they try to debunk fake news and"
"14108760","14117300"," I Sometimes I click on those articles because they look kind of sketch to me Even though they're"
"14117300","14125340"," used to prove what a false statement or a false news article was what's fascinating is I clicked on"
"14125340","14127760"," some of these articles over the course of about a week."
"14127780","14135900"," This was about a month ago or so And I was like man, why are they citing and you know"
"14135900","14142300"," what it had to do with it had to do with um it was something to do with palestine and"
"14142300","14152220"," um Palestine and Israel when the it was like rockets or bombs or whatever"
"14152220","14162160"," artillery that was claimed to have hit a parking lot or a hospital in gaza And uh, there was a"
"14162160","14170400"," lot of discussion over um Um When it was found out that israel did not I guess they've proven that"
"14170400","14179540"," israel did not Uh actually bomb that parking lot Uh did the new york times or washington post ever"
"14179540","14185420"," make a correction Uh in that thesis that they were pushing to sell newspapers, right?"
"14186180","14192280"," And uh, no, I don't care about what the yes or no or anything surrounding that I cared more about"
"14192940","14201320"," Uh, what google news or google news specifically how they would address it And so They asked the"
"14201320","14206200"," question down inside of that google news thing about that incident saying after it was confirmed"
"14206200","14210880"," that israel hadn't done that Uh, they said they had they posed the question. "
"14211260","14218120"," Um Did the washington post or the new york times actually say that israel did this Now they were"
"14218120","14225700"," citing Some news sources that looks kind of sketchy to me Right, so I was went down the rabbit hole"
"14225700","14233920"," on this and I'm trying to research who the writers of these articles are And you can't assign them"
"14233920","14240580"," to real people Uh, so they've got like fake reporters Now as i'm reading the articles i'm going to"
"14240580","14247420"," myself man all this looks it's passable It's all passing the mustard The mustard test, but then"
"14247420","14251900"," there's this little part where i'm like, man, that's not passing the mustard test The uncanny"
"14251900","14259240"," validness how this article is written And so what I found most fascinating was a lot of these, uh,"
"14259540","14266800"," written language model ais that are being used to write news stories for you They're citing, uh,"
"14267280","14276540"," factual information But it's like dated information or not really relevant Uh to the news that's"
"14276540","14283380"," being reported And what's fascinating about that is uh, you can be telling the truth about a"
"14283380","14291180"," subject Um, that's sightable Uh, but really isn't the truth in whatever they're reporting or"
"14291180","14299680"," irrelevant to what they're reporting Um, or even current data Right, so some of this data that"
"14299680","14304320"," they're using i'm like, yeah, an example would be this if this is a prime example I'm gonna give"
"14304320","14310940"," you a simplified and or explanation what i'm trying to get across to you If you go to, uh, if"
"14310940","14318620"," you right now where to go and read a lot of these stories about Detroit, Michigan Uh, they use a"
"14318620","14325300"," lot of and there's a lot of ai too writing a lot of articles, uh, about, uh, mission specifically"
"14325300","14334000"," to trade michigan, uh, and they cite data That is a decade plus old To build a thesis and then"
"14334000","14341100"," write a fucking essay about it And you start to realize that, um Or you're starting to question"
"14341100","14345540"," who's the writer And, uh, are they using more current data?"
"14346320","14350300"," Are they using data that's coming up the fred immediately or are they using like census data?"
"14350720","14354480"," Are they using data that's, uh, five years old 10 years old?"
"14355100","14359720"," And while trying to make their point about something being horrible or good or whatever i can"
"14359720","14365480"," assure you That if you if you search current data, matter of fact, same, we see just in a story"
"14365480","14373980"," on, uh, the housing Uh markets we're booming here booming like 10 percent 10 percent Prices just"
"14373980","14380220"," cranking cranking month by month boom boom boom going up if you were to travel to Detroit right now"
"14380840","14386720"," Nothing is like it was 10 years ago or five years ago So if you're a human The expectation would"
"14386720","14392660"," be to be looking for more current data So though the data in that story might be accurate, it's"
"14392660","14400740"," based it's only accurate because they're basing it upon a stale data Uh, so anyways, I think that's"
"14400740","14406780"," probably a bigger risk to The election season forgot the deep but maybe down the road the deep"
"14406780","14409900"," banks will be an issue Oh, yeah, baby."
"14410180","14414900"," Oh It's happening right now."
"14415380","14424600"," So The so the point i'm trying to make to is this you can get, um, ai Uh, let's see"
"14424600","14434960"," the prevalence of ai citing data that's accurate or truthful but not necessarily uh"
"14434960","14442000"," accurate to pushing the narrative Or pushing the or not necessarily accurate to what's factual for"
"14442000","14448740"," right now Um, so you can be pushing a narrative out there Against or for any candidate out there"
"14448740","14457760"," and use Use like facts that may that might not be actually true um Or relevant to what's being"
"14457760","14467180"," pushed out there So so to conclude My my thesis here is that if you want to"
"14467180","14473800"," circumvent Uh Fact checkers whether it's like snopes or circumvent. "
"14474380","14476200"," Um, I don't know."
"14476360","14481120"," There's a bunch of the difference like Fact checking groups out there."
"14481200","14483200"," There's finchwet fact checkers out there, right?"
"14483980","14488660"," There's uh all kinds of fact checking you can actually instead of just lying with point blank"
"14488660","14494840"," fucking falsities You can just you can actually find actual facts to still tell the story you want"
"14494840","14502240"," to tell That would that would beat those fact checking websites So I think that's the real problem"
"14502240","14505100"," as we come into This election season. "
"14505260","14507060"," Am I making any sense saying that?"
"14507760","14515000"," So rather than Pushing a deep fake or pushing a deep or a or a false statement or something"
"14515000","14515560"," unverified."
"14515560","14522700"," You just find facts that are that would beat Uh, it's just it's just like a A virus beating of"
"14522700","14523740"," anti-virus software."
"14524460","14534250"," You're just finding a way around this to say no, we're right in what we're saying Yeah, yeah Yeah,"
"14534330","14540810"," then you got barred making itself so shut up right and setting itself So I think that's the next"
"14540810","14546690"," step for this election specifically Uh, you can you can actually just not you're not even fudging"
"14546690","14546950"," facts. "
"14547310","14552770"," You're just Siding facts that are might not be relevant but would pass the mustard test as being"
"14552770","14571390"," factual Trading 74 cents right now on 60 cents spy calls for tomorrow boys and girls Are"

"15798300","15803520"," measure it and see if it's a larger move or not Uh, but we've got what's really relevant that looks"
"15803520","15808740"," like it's really relevant here is this weekly daily Velo But weekly velocity seems to be a driver"
"15809220","15811760"," If I were to look at the like how does this ticker trade?"
"15812240","15821200"," It looks to me like uh weekly velocity is is a big one for um For moves for Abercrombie and"
"15821200","15827840"," Fitch Anytime you're down here you're buying a dip right Uh from there you can have an extension to"
"15827840","15828640"," the upside, right?"

"15858920","15864800"," That's kind of concerning Now, even though this is concerning on a daily basis, you still don't"
"15864800","15871360"," short You still do not short They say like don't short at dull market, but you never ever short"
"15871360","15872820"," anything that's on trend, right?"
"15873460","15876020"," Something that's blasting off like this is now."
"15876080","15883320"," We do have the call wall above Uh at $100 Uh, we also have a bunch of calls expiring Right"
"15883320","15889320"," not a ton but some Uh, so it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility to see some kind"
"15889320","15896140"," of a pullback or even some kind of a vwop check down here That's $66 Uh, you are going to"
"15896140","15901820"," expect though that dip to be bought at 89 97 Although you're you see got like PT one would be"
"15902360","15910920"," 89 97 PT two would be uh, 80 bucks PT three is 66 Uh, oh seven Now we do have"
"15910920","15916160"," some examples of the down days and it reverses right trying to short that not working right trying"
"15916160","15921620"," to short that Not working right so how do we find out when to short this stock if that's what"
"15921620","15925420"," you're asking or if we're going higher or whatever We're going to look at a different time frame. "
"15925600","15929760"," We're going to look at a 30 minute time frame This is the one that I like to take swing"
"15929760","15934860"," trades on Now we have a series that we have declining velocity and the daily velocity that looks"
"15934860","15935120"," good."
"15935140","15942340"," I like that Um, I do like that to to short this stock but what are we looking for to"
"15943080","15947180"," Short this ticker or Continue on trend in this ticker."
"15947200","15947460"," Okay. "
"15948220","15952420"," Uh, so we're going to get down a more granular granule Level here."
"15952540","15957260"," We're going to get out to a one minute Uh, basis why we want to go on the one minute"
"15957260","15966420"," basis because It's not good enough to just have price blast down is it You bounce up here and"
"15966420","15970720"," you're fucked if you try to short so what I would say to you would be two things You're looking"
"15970720","15974120"," for a cross of the half hour over the one hour trigger."
"15974340","15981940"," We got that Have we had a confirmation yet though Uh, we had a confirmation yet though on doom and"
"15981940","15985580"," gloom on this ticker No And what does that look like?"
"15985720","15990680"," We've always said up or down if we blast through the hourly triggered for a trend reversal You"
"15990680","15999020"," still want that confirmation For a true trend true trend reversal Okay, we haven't had that yet. "
"15999160","16001620"," So if you're trying to short abacromion pitch."
"16002060","16010400"," I would prefer to see price come back up and reject And right now we're just back to our previous"
"16010400","16013140"," low down here Right, we got a new low here."
"16013320","16017300"," That's a good sign for bears Uh, your next if you don't want to know where your next stop is"
"16017300","16027230"," it's uh right here That's your next stop right there And I would"
"16027230","16030230"," personally because we tagged this previous low. "
"16030250","16035030"," I'd personally like to see Uh, this ticker if you wanted to short it right there."
"16035170","16040250"," That's the better short right there To me at least because it's a real trend reversal and that"
"16040250","16050170"," would target 90 bucks somewhere down there so For me at least for trend reversal, I'm"
"16050170","16057930"," looking for a rejection to move down As of right now, uh, this stock is still bullish and is not"
"16057930","16061010"," shortable in my viewpoint until this happens."
"16061450","16067610"," So Uh, my thesis number one at this point, even though we're at the top up here at the call"

"18001480","18002440"," Spoons upside target."
"18002680","18003460"," If it squeezes."
"18003880","18008280"," It's off the fucking charts like four eighteen four twenty four eighteen, maybe. "
"18008820","18009360"," I don't know."
"18009440","18013700"," I don't think we get there, but that's that."
"18013820","18015040"," Oh, I got that wrong. "
"18015140","18015380"," Hold on."
"18015460","18015700"," Hold on."
"18015780","18015920"," Whoa. "
"18016020","18018500"," I'm going a little."
"18019540","18022780"," Four sixteen thirty four sixteen thirty three something like that."
"18024200","18029780"," If that happens, but what is Biden on?"
"18029940","18031020"," Should we put him on right now?"
"18031600","18032520"," Should we have him on the background?"
"18032520","18033580"," See if he tries to. "
"18033980","18038580"," Someone was saying in street or is it a trade podcast made in stream that he's been getting beaten"
"18038580","18040060"," up past couple of weeks."
"18040200","18043100"," Iowa Cox says and he's probably going to try to come out swinging."
"18066910","18075570"," Some more data out of litter as US high yield funds see one billion dollars of inflow in the week. "
"18076010","18079750"," Luca now officially is the US Senate passes the stop gap spending."
"18079750","18083230"," And then go ascending the house for final passage."
"18084770","18086330"," Y'all done pissed off. "
"18086490","18089650"," Go Biden bears to the house now for final passage."
"18145280","18147360"," Look at that right now, man."
"18147680","18149400"," Pain trade is on. "
"18170100","18171100"," Joe donut."
"18171280","18175880"," If you're out there, close your fucking call spreads."
"18177360","18179880"," I had Joe donut asked me earlier on a chat. "
"18180140","18180360"," He goes."
"18181120","18181600"," He goes."
"18181620","18182840"," I didn't close all my call spreads. "
"18182940","18183760"," What should I do or not?"
"18183820","18184220"," What should I do?"
"18184400","18185480"," He's like, we ever go."
"18185640","18186820"," Not even knows that was just."
"18186980","18188020"," I didn't have a close on a call spreads. "
"18188060","18188560"," I'm like, don't worry."
"18188640","18189360"," We're going back up there."
"18191200","18192400"," I got to call him right now. "
"18192420","18194900"," He said, I love you cap."
"18197720","18198420"," He texted."
"18199780","18202840"," Close your fucking close your fucking spreads. "
"18247430","18248430"," Dude, I love you, Bork."
"18253960","18255340"," Let's take a look at book maps."
"18255520","18256340"," See where those sellers are. "
"18256440","18256700"," I see that."
"18256820","18256980"," Sorry."
"18257120","18257840"," Let's take a look. "
"18258220","18258540"," Close your look."
"18258840","18263860"," We got here seeing reports as well that the house is set to vote later today, a head of a"
"18263860","18267880"," weekend deadline for the stopgap funding bill to a government shutdown."
"18268360","18270340"," Yeah, I've got like topping right here. "
"18270460","18274140"," I've got topping somewhere in here."
"18274940","18278020"," There's a, there's a, there's an STX cell above here."
"18282890","18284670"," Let's take a look and see heads up. "
"18285970","18288470"," If you're out there right now, okay, heads up right now."
"18288490","18289230"," You see this right here?"
"18289310","18290750"," We're hitting that gamma wall right now."
"18291550","18293330"," See that upside target right here?"
"18295070","18298330"," Now, if we do break above your next target is 4800. "
"18299270","18303150"," So that's going to be your STX cell on the main screen here."
"18303150","18306510"," So this would be your STX cell or RTX cell or whatever."
"18309190","18310990"," We're in there somewhere else. "
"18311270","18312310"," It's probably lower than this."
"18314350","18314910"," 4773."
"18316010","18316550"," Two bucks lower. "
"18317710","18320370"," Two bucks and change lower probably probably right here."
"18329710","18331950"," That's your next target somewhere in there right there."
"18392190","18400430"," I got a mirror, a mirror is chiming in saying next target above is 48 or 480 on SPX. "
"18402430","18405010"," 480 on SPX, mirror chiming in."
"18405570","18406470"," Hold on."
"18417560","18419500"," Maybe we can get mirror on here. "
"18420560","18421980"," We're forming a base right now."
"18422020","18422640"," Do you see that base?"
"18422640","18423140"," We're forming."
"18425680","18427300"," Let's see if we can get mirror in here on. "
"18427420","18428400"," He'll kill jumping on YouTube."
"18431900","18434560"," Mirror is a pro if you don't know already."
"18435160","18436080"," You guys don't know it. "
"18484230","18485930"," I asked mirror if you come on and say hello."
"18486230","18487650"," Maybe we can get him on the stream here and say hi."
"18488990","18491370"," Look at him trying to form another fucking base here. "
"18492810","18494610"," The ice saying go long here to 480."
"18495110","18496930"," He's saying we can keep going up here."
"18498170","18499590"," We'll see if that's real or not. "
"18500950","18503050"," Maybe it's just a shit post on Twitter."
"18522130","18525010"," We got a big key saying look for some grinding here."
"18526650","18527830"," 242 in the afternoon. "
"18551270","18551970"," Oh wait a minute."
"18552070","18553850"," I think he might have given it a heads up."
"18553910","18554790"," He might be here. "
"18557130","18560510"," I want to know from arrows that last 45 minutes of the day."
"18560670","18561730"," Last 20 minutes of the day."
"18562410","18563870"," He can usually give a dude. "
"18564070","18565270"," Like marrows a bad ass."
"18565550","18568530"," Like he'll be like take her or go long."
"18568750","18570050"," He won't say exactly. "
"18570370","18571690"," We're about to take the hedge off."
"18571830","18572370"," And I'm like sweet."
"18573230","18574070"," Here we go. "
"18577150","18578550"," Here we fucking go."
"18597970","18599130"," Tang is saying."
"18599930","18601170"," Tang says breaking news. "
"18601430","18604830"," Houthis are now training a blue whale to attack and sink US warships."
"18605510","18607030"," Beware of Houthi and the blowfish."
"18607450","18608450"," I think that was a good one. "
"18609130","18610050"," No, that was a funny one."
"18654890","18663110"," Seeing now Brent crude futures settling up $17.10 a barrel, which is up $1.22. Or one spot five,"
"18663110","18664430"," seven percent on the session."
"18679570","18683550"," Take your train from macro headline risk with financial use price. "
"18684130","18687270"," Now only $99 a year for our real time service."
"18690510","18692250"," I got a dray."
"18692870","18696730"," The on the moon is saying a lot of volume just came in on SPX 4760P. "
"18697190","18698910"," Not sure if buys or sells."
"18700430","18701990"," Just heads up to you guys out there."
"18736140","18737760"," Yeah, you know, it's a good point. "
"18738140","18740840"," AG traders saying cheap puts for tomorrow."
"18743480","18746080"," I am looking for I will say something to you."
"18746100","18747820"," I want to say something to you guys out there. "
"18747920","18748100"," Okay."
"18748600","18749220"," This is important."
"18750900","18755140"," I am looking for an entry on puts somewhere up here. "
"18755520","18757000"," Not too far from where we are."
"18757000","18761560"," Like anywhere from here to 480, 478 or 75."
"18762580","18765420"," Not a bad idea to take a put spread up here. "
"18765820","18766960"," This is like the start."
"18767740","18768940"," I'm going to write that out."
"18769100","18770060"," I'm going to put that into it. "
"18911610","18913630"," So I guess that point here is this."
"18915550","18917570"," Anywhere from here to about 478."
"18918330","18919190"," Somewhere up in here. "
"18922440","18923720"," Somewhere up in here, right?"
"18923920","18926260"," Anywhere from like you just start thinking about it."
"18926740","18929000"," Anywhere from up in here to here."
"18930180","18936060"," You're looking for some kind of a put spread for end of January. "
"18937540","18938820"," Just be aware of that."
"18938900","18939100"," Okay."
"18939700","18942060"," Doesn't mean you have to take it now but start thinking about it. "
"18942080","18942300"," Okay."
"18942300","18945860"," What we're going to do here on the stream is we're going to bring up a trade."
"18946900","18949000"," We're going to bring up that trade right now. "
"18949540","18950660"," So let's look at."
"18952560","18953860"," What should I bring up here."
"18958300","18960140"," Let's take a look at. "
"18960920","18964320"," I'll bring up this we will."
"18968030","18969650"," And just down here."
"18971830","18972910"," Let's take a look at Webull. "
"18973010","18974330"," It's a 30 minute chart on Webull."
"18975710","18977530"," I got the 30th over here."
"18977630","18978930"," Here's January 30th. "
"18979850","18979970"," Right."
"18980270","18982390"," So let's look at it from this perspective here."
"18982570","18983550"," Let's go over to this here. "
"18987390","18989450"," Webull chart, trigger screen."
"18990410","18991250"," That's the right one."
"18992130","18992450"," Okay. "
"18992730","18993590"," So just over here."
"18995170","18998650"," I'm not anti a big giant squeeze here."
"18999010","18999730"," This is something else. "
"18999730","19001950"," Not anti a big giant squeeze here."
"19003270","19004950"," But somewhere in here."
"19006110","19009150"," Here's a 479. "
"19009410","19010650"," Here's 481."
"19010810","19011010"," Okay."
"19011150","19013270"," So for anywhere from where we are right. "
"19013550","19013950"," Oh, I see there."
"19015970","19018370"," Right where this yellow line is right here, right?"
"19020350","19021690"," Anywhere in here."
"19024130","19025330"," Anywhere in this zone. "
"19030200","19031900"," I want to take."
"19033940","19036500"," Some kind of a trade into the 30th."
"19038280","19039180"," Down here. "
"19041040","19048300"," Now you've got you got you got a ball signal saying he's really fearful of the risk to the"
"19048300","19049140"," downside, right?"
"19050800","19051700"," And I am too."
"19052320","19053620"," I understand that risk."
"19054040","19055020"," Where does that risk lie?"
"19056480","19059180"," That risk lies underneath the gamma flip. "
"19060700","19061440"," Right here."
"19062500","19065540"," Now currently we are above the gamma flip, aren't we?"
"19066440","19070100"," So for me, I'm not going to put that much risk on."
"19070220","19071580"," I'm not going to take like a put spread. "
"19072160","19074400"," And have it dated for down here."
"19074840","19076460"," So I got to do it a little bit more in the money."
"19077000","19077760"," Does that make sense?"
"19078680","19079960"," So you got 480 here. "
"19080760","19084780"," And you've got the you've got the gamma flip down here, right?"
"19084780","19087520"," That was at 472, 470."
"19087960","19089640"," I think that makes for a pretty decent trade."
"19090640","19095800"," So like a 480, 470 has a much higher probability of printing. "
"19097800","19098320"," Right?"
"19098580","19100080"," Has a much higher probability of printing."
"19102280","19103740"," Something like this here."
"19104280","19110180"," Even if my thesis is that we go down here or even if the signals are saying this possible that. "
"19110520","19114140"," And you've got a trader podcast saying don't expect any of this, right?"
"19114360","19117320"," That he doesn't think any of the dip is going to be anything like that."
"19117460","19121620"," So just in here, we're kind of following that right now, right?"
"19121880","19122240"," See that?"
"19122440","19124540"," Like following that whole thing right there, right?"
"19125140","19126040"," So somewhere in here."
"19126640","19127980"," Trying to capture this right here. "
"19128620","19128920"," Right?"
"19129360","19132460"," 470 even seems a little out the wall right there."
"19132580","19134560"," So 474."
"19136480","19141100"," So let's take a look at a 48474 put spread. "
"19142600","19143980"," And we'll take a look at it."
"19144200","19144920"," And what can we do here?"
"19145440","19146900"," We can do what can we do here?"
"19147280","19150580"," We can do we can trade the market up as it goes up."
"19151540","19157120"," But we could also put some kind of like some kind of a way to make a trade here, make"
"19157120","19163040"," some money or we do like 480 to 470 or 460 and we'll find out where it prints. "
"19163620","19165600"," So give me a second here and I will bring up."
"19166940","19169600"," I'm just going to bring something up here so we can look for a trade."
"19172420","19173500"," A quick second here. "
"19180180","19181840"," So we can find a trade together."
"19199790","19200630"," Can we do this?"
"19201750","19203930"," Can I go to the old way they did this on the site?"
"19214380","19214740"," Okay."
"19216940","19220120"," So you see this, you see this previous high back here, right?"
"19220260","19221700"," That's 477, 478. "
"19222500","19225740"," We got 480 up here, expected moves coming up for spoons."
"19226800","19228200"," This looks pretty bullish right here, right?"
"19228440","19229640"," It's pretty fucking bullish right here."
"19231700","19235140"," And I'm not going to look as low as 470, maybe 472. "
"19235700","19240480"," So we'll see a bearish and we're going to do a put spread."
"19240480","19246480"," And expiry, I'm going to look for January 30th."
"19252960","19256940"," And there's 480 right there, right?"
"19258620","19260920"," And then for where am I in the green?"
"19261460","19261800"," There's 470. "
"19263140","19266000"," Watched over here what it costs when I get paid here, okay?"
"19269480","19270600"," So what do we got here?"
"19271840","19273460"," You're in the money 480 maybe?"
"19277210","19279950"," That's actually not so bad right there either, 485."
"19288220","19289280"," What about a 470?"
"19294320","19296260"," It's not too bad of a trade right there, is it?"
"19296600","19298880"," It costs 788, pays 712."
"19299440","19300280"," It's not great, not bad. "
"19301200","19303280"," Now I would have to be by the 30th."
"19305080","19310600"," Even if we squeeze up here, I just need, you know, if we're up here like this, right?"
"19313760","19317200"," Even if we squeeze up here, all I need to do is be down here to be in the money."
"19317380","19317720"," You see it?"
"19318820","19319480"," That minimal. "
"19319640","19320740"," I'll try to take that money."
"19320940","19323700"," Anything down here, I'll be 100% right?"
"19324240","19325680"," Actually below here, I'll be 100%."
"19325680","19326740"," But let's take a look and see. "
"19330720","19331620"," Something like that."
"19331800","19332180"," You see that?"
"19333320","19337940"," Now I'm going to buy this trade right now or purchase this trade right now, more than likely not."
"19338140","19341440"," What I'm going to do is wait for price to get up here. "
"19341640","19347900"," I want price to be somewhere around this area right here, like 480 to place this trade."
"19348500","19352680"," So when we get up to 480 up here, or if we do get 480, I'm going to be looking"
"19352680","19356100"," to place this trade and have a bottom of 470."
"19356600","19360600"," So 485, 470, somewhere in there. "
"19361260","19365680"," Not place the trade until we get a rejection and a confirmation to the upside."
"19367240","19369580"," So we'll just go back to the main screen right here."
"19371340","19374620"," And see where this yellow box is and this red box is. "
"19375520","19376640"," This is 478."
"19377560","19379000"," So anywhere up in here."
"19380120","19384260"," I can start to think about think about for an SPX. "
"19384260","19388280"," If we're at 4800, start placing a 485."
"19389420","19390700"," For 70."
"19391140","19392100"," So 485. "
"19392600","19396060"," I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to put this on."
"19396600","19397580"," Then to it."
"19408770","19410850"," For 4800 on SPX. "
"19415070","19416110"," To place."
"19418850","19419890"," It puts bread."
"19423430","19425390"," Or what is it plus 45. "
"19431540","19437430"," But I have that right."
"19437550","19438990"," I think I think tell me if I got this wrong."
"19441330","19443290"," Let me do this again. "
"19443530","19444350"," Hold me one quick second."
"19446250","19447830"," It's a plus 45."
"19450210","19451130"," Long put. "
"19486640","19487260"," 70."
"19496630","19497830"," For 130."
"19507390","19509330"," Let's take a look one more time at. "
"19511950","19513230"," Yeah, somewhere in there."
"19575750","19577690"," All right, so I made that public."
"19761150","19840500"," Oh, chips"
"19840500","19841460"," were the new railroad. "
"19841460","19842080"," I don't know."
"19842180","19842860"," We have to figure out."
"19842920","19844240"," Pay pals out there. "
"19844420","19848420"," We're going to make an announcement that we get a reaction on that with PayPal or no."
"19849680","19850160"," Bizarre."
"19850400","19851800"," What's PayPal doing right now?"
"19853020","19854500"," Does it make sense to you?"
"19854640","19856720"," Are you bracing for anything worse?"
"19857080","19863780"," And do you agree that the bond market itself is in a zone where stocks can still be okay?"
"19864900","19869400"," Yeah, well, I think it makes sense that we're in a little bit of a risk off phase here with"
"19869400","19869800"," the markets. "
"19870020","19872360"," Obviously, you guys have talked about risk off the markets."
"19872360","19874820"," But look, we're reprising."
"19875320","19876720"," We're risk off the markets. "
"19877060","19877180"," Okay."
"19877280","19881200"," The last year, Mike, about how six cuts was way too optimistic."
"19881200","19881880"," Oh, fuck. "
"19882100","19882720"," There we go."
"19882760","19886880"," That's why I think you're seeing some of the elevation in the yields."
"19887140","19888720"," And so I think it's okay for you. "
"19888740","19889760"," We're risk off in the markets."
"19889780","19890120"," Okay."
"19890840","19893200"," It's more aligned with what the Fed expectation. "
"19893620","19894500"," Holy shit."
"19894540","19896780"," Financial conditions index."
"19897620","19900340"," She's getting blown the fuck out right now, isn't she?"
"19900560","19904520"," And that index, you've got geopolitical issues going on. "
"19904920","19907280"," We're risk off right now."
"19907620","19908880"," We're short the fuck out of the market."
"19909060","19911240"," We're getting squeezed currently as a monsoon to see right now. "
"19911340","19913040"," Fuck it."
"19913040","19915220"," We need to bring that down."
"19915640","19918620"," And we've seen it come down a little bit and set a little bit of a low bar. "
"19919040","19923480"," I also think it's important, Mike, to know that I think buyers are."
"19923480","19924980"," We're fucking risk off right here."
"19924980","19926140"," We're fucking back short. "
"19933780","19935380"," We're getting squeezed right now."
"19935460","19937400"," I'm on CNBC right now trying to push my own."
"19938920","19942980"," Plus, you've got that expires in a few weeks. "
"19943180","19944620"," Maybe that'll be a little bit of a tail."
"19944820","19950080"," I want you to know that I'm getting squeezed right now and they gave me a spot on CNBC so"
"19950080","19953420"," that I can tell you guys, please stop squeezing me."
"19953420","19954220"," You're all up trend. "
"19954580","19960740"," You're looking for around 50% of the names and ordered in the S&P to hit 20 day lows."
"19961060","19964080"," Right now, we're about 36, 37% of the names."
"19964580","19968800"," So people may be waiting a little bit, waiting for a little bit more of a pullback on this"
"19969500","19971160"," revaluation that we're having in the market. "
"19971700","19973620"," And then we'll see some maybe positive momentum."
"19974220","19979400"," Yeah, I mean, for sure, the indexes outside the S&P have already seen a little bit of some of"
"19979400","19983960"," those oversold conditions, tactical potential dip buying opportunities in the Russell, things like"
"19983960","19988520"," that start to develop, but maybe not quite a real fat pitch at the moment."
"19988620","19994600"," I just want to get into the Fed expectations and kind of the cash on the sidelines type argument. "
"19994900","19995420"," Just a little bit."
"19995920","20001380"," Victoria, you said that maybe six rate cuts, which is on a given day, what's priced into the Fed"
"20001380","20003400"," Fund's futures curve, is a little optimistic."
"20004220","20009140"," I would say that's probably pessimistic based on what the economy might have to do to get us there. "
"20009640","20015920"," I also can't find an actual living, breathing human being who is saying, yep, I fully expect six"
"20015920","20016340"," rate cuts."
"20016680","20020920"," So it seems to be a little bit of an exercise, you know, what if might happen down the road"
"20020920","20025420"," at the end of the year that might cause the Fed to have to really open up the easing gates"
"20025420","20029060"," as opposed to people investing today's dollar based on that assumption."
"20030300","20034140"," Yeah, part of the problem here, obviously the markets were priced to perfection, right?"
"20034140","20039100"," And they had those six expectations and they're based on the dot plot that we had previously. "
"20039440","20041380"," And they got, you know, the market got ahead of itself."
"20041740","20047200"," So I think it's reprising that, but where I think some of the misunderstanding is the Fed, in my"
"20047200","20051140"," opinion, is not afraid that they're not restrictive enough at this level."
"20051460","20053880"," I think they believe they are in restrictive territory. "
"20053880","20055000"," They have said that."
"20055260","20061040"," I think what the Fed is afraid of is reigniting inflation when you've got potential supply chain"
"20061040","20066280"," issues that are going on because of what we're seeing in the Red Sea and the extra cost that is"
"20066280","20067640"," costing companies for that."
"20067860","20071240"," Because the consumer remains resilient, we saw retail sales. "
"20071740","20073040"," The demand is still there."
"20073300","20078460"," You've got a layer of that consumer, even though we're seeing the whole company."
"20078940","20080600"," It's still pretty supportive. "
"20080800","20084260"," We saw the weekly jobless claims number today below 200,000."
"20084640","20089300"," So I think the Fed's fear would be a reigniting of inflation."
"20089300","20091220"," So they want to take it very slow. "
"20091560","20094340"," Bostic said, look, maybe third quarter of this year."
"20094780","20097780"," I'm thinking probably at the June meeting where you get a new dot plot."
"20097980","20100200"," Perhaps that's when they start easing a little bit. "
"20100500","20102240"," But that's where the Fed lies right now."
"20102260","20105940"," And I think the market is making its way to kind of meet the Fed in the middle on this."
"20106260","20108660"," Yeah, we see what some of what Bostic had to say today. "
"20108660","20111680"," Of course, Atlanta Fed President, Rafael Bostic speaking."
"20111880","20115080"," He says third quarter is his working assumption, but he pulled the forward from the fourth quarter."
"20115300","20119280"," He's also essentially saying, look, let's not lock ourselves into a certain level. "
"20120380","20124500"," So we have to essentially preserve a little bit of flexibility and see what comes."
"20124720","20127140"," But it seems like they're pretty confident that inflation's going to happen."
"20127140","20128020"," I love you too, guys, Molly. "
"20130200","20133200"," I'm struggling for the right words to describe how I feel about this competition."
"20133460","20133700"," You'll find them."
"20133880","20134740"," I do find them. "
"20135080","20136020"," I have found them."
"20136360","20138140"," I gave you four minutes to come up with the right words."
"20138420","20143280"," Listen, listen, this idea, I couldn't agree more with what you said. "
"20143640","20145180"," There's no living in human beings."
"20145180","20151280"," The market, there's binomial outcomes that get priced into the Fed fund futures market, which"
"20151280","20154220"," itself is a liquid and you shouldn't really draw too much information from it."
"20154420","20156420"," But no one thinks they're going to cut six times. "
"20156500","20159440"," And this idea that Fed members keep coming out and telling."
"20159440","20160360"," Oh my God."
"20160380","20162140"," As if that's new information. "
"20162580","20163520"," Completely reject that."
"20163820","20166680"," There's no human being actively trading who thinks they're going to cut six times."
"20167220","20169460"," I disagree with a whole portion of what the Tory just said. "
"20169620","20172380"," Not because it's wrong per se, but for other reasons."
"20172380","20176380"," But I will take issue with one specific thing that lets this idea that there's quote unquote cash"
"20176380","20176880"," on the sidelines."
"20177600","20179060"," First of all, there's no cash on the sidelines. "
"20179420","20180360"," It's always in something."
"20180880","20181960"," I think we would all acknowledge that."
"20182240","20186200"," But more importantly, the amount of money in money markets went straight up. "
"20186360","20188200"," The entire time the market went straight up."
"20188300","20189460"," There was no limit."
"20189640","20194280"," There was no governor on equity market appreciation because more money was going into the market. "
"20194460","20199860"," And the idea that somehow that money coming out of mutual funds will somehow reignite the market to"
"20199860","20201060"," a degree that we haven't already seen."
"20201060","20202500"," I would take issue with that as well."
"20202700","20203340"," Fair enough. "
"20203580","20210640"," But clearly, there is a sense in which you need to have confidence that the economy is going to"
"20210640","20212280"," hang in there and earnings are going to come through."
"20212560","20215780"," Whether that means people take money out of their money market funds or not."
"20215920","20220320"," Whether it means they just remain invested in stocks and ride it or allow their equity allocations"
"20220320","20221260"," to go higher, Joe. "
"20221560","20226640"," So I think the question really is, whatever the Fed might do and whatever it might do it, can we"
"20226640","20230160"," take heart in the unemployment claims below 200,000 today?"
"20230160","20231440"," Maybe it's a fluke on weather."
"20231960","20234000"," The retail sales reported yesterday."
"20234340","20237660"," B of A saying, actually, maybe it was overstated by seasonal factors. "
"20238140","20243220"," To me, the concern would be if you think all of this really encouraging data is a complete head"
"20243220","20247560"," thing and it's actually we're actually decelerating faster and the Fed's not going to be there to"
"20247560","20247940"," catch us."
"20248280","20252480"," Well, if that is the case, then it's very clear to me that in terms of..."
"20252480","20253620"," When's the ass face coming in?"
"20253720","20254200"," He's coming in."
"20254480","20256840"," I don't know if the DM him and try to get him on. "
"20257020","20258020"," I got to set him up, make sure."
"20259300","20261720"," We know what we're talking about on the stream, stuff like that."
"20262020","20264700"," I don't want to surprise anybody on the stream. "
"20265880","20266940"," So I got to set it up."
"20267080","20270900"," I'm going to talk to Binky and see if we can line up getting him on the stream and then"
"20270900","20272580"," do a pre-interview with him."
"20273580","20275640"," So he's prepared to talk and stuff like that. "
"20275840","20277320"," I hate bringing people on the stream."
"20277800","20284760"," And in other areas of the S&P sectors as well, you can find..."
"20284760","20289300"," So like back in the day, I tried to bring people on the stream and the either didn't fail felt"
"20289300","20290940"," uncomfortable or we didn't have a plan."
"20290960","20294920"," So it's always good if possible to have some kind of a..."
"20295780","20298520"," It's not a script but like, hey, we want to ask you these questions. "
"20299100","20301280"," Are you comfortable or want to answer those things?"
"20301780","20303340"," You want to do research, that kind of stuff."
"20303500","20306980"," So I'm not like Johnny in the spot like, hey, come up the top of your fucking head and give"
"20306980","20307720"," me some answers here."
"20307840","20308940"," It's not cool to do that to people. "
"20309780","20312300"," Dude, when I first started streaming, it was brutal."
"20312300","20319500"," I got to prepare every day to stream and at least have an awareness of what is there so that"
"20319500","20321780"," if you ask a question, I have to kind of be prepared."
"20322680","20326760"," So I try to do that with a guest on the stream unless they don't ask to or they want"
"20326760","20331140"," us to talk about specific, pre-talk about specific things and just let them have full rain to do"
"20331140","20331660"," whatever they want. "
"20335330","20335770"," I will."
"20337270","20338250"," Hold on, I'll ask them."
"20346660","20347620"," I will ask them. "
"20347840","20348980"," So I don't like setting people up."
"20349080","20349480"," It's not cool."
"20350980","20356180"," And I think some, I think that a lot of people are afraid to be interviewed because of that. "
"20356300","20360120"," They don't realize that or like they're, I think, and I think it's a natural thing."
"20360360","20362160"," Like, hey, somebody asked me to do this show."
"20363800","20365000"," I'm not going on there. "
"20365060","20366240"," I can look like a fucking fool, right?"
"20366440","20367980"," I don't want to look at a fucking fool in front of anybody."
"20368540","20372460"," They might not be aware that you always do a pre."
"20373080","20377320"," It's not a screening per se, like you can or can't be on the show, but it's like a pre "
"20377320","20380300","-screening though when you like meet with people and you say, okay, what do you want to talk about?"
"20381420","20385040"," We write out a bunch of bullet points and then we come on the show, we do a discussion and"
"20385440","20388020"," they're prepared and they won't get any whammies for me. "
"20388140","20391740"," I'm not here to shit out anybody or have them fail."
"20392320","20394340"," I want them to look like a fucking superstar when they're here."
"20394600","20394740"," Always. "
"20396020","20400580"," They're taking time out of their day to be on a show with, you know, a large audience."
"20401460","20405760"," And so I want to make sure that they feel comfortable through the entire thing."
"20408120","20409780"," I wrote that down bull for trading. "
"20416150","20418770"," That would be crazy beyond the Joe Rogan."
"20418990","20420510"," I don't know if I could, I'd probably freak out."
"20427360","20428000"," You ready?"
"20428480","20436780"," 4.75 traded 60 cents and now is trading $2.10. Almost was a 300% trade, 40% trade"
"20436780","20438020"," somewhere in there. "
"20438020","20439820"," Just fucking cranking right now."
"20441000","20442540"," Fucking cranking right now."
"20443940","20445740"," We're absolutely cranking right now. "
"20447860","20449660"," Who gets too much hate?"
"20449940","20450740"," Ask face does."
"20451680","20453160"," Dude, I'll tell you what."
"20453320","20454520"," I want to tell you guys again. "
"20454640","20455780"," I'm going to make this short and sweet."
"20456560","20463680"," If you see people shitting on people on Fintuit, the person that's doing the shitting on, at least"
"20463680","20468860"," go and find out if they add anything to the community, either in posts or responses."
"20469960","20475720"," Now, if they do and they're giving some critique or whatever, they don't like somebody, I usually"
"20475720","20477000"," leave those people alone. "
"20477640","20484960"," But if they have like a history of adding any kind of benefit to Fintuit, I will leave that."
"20485120","20487420"," I won't block them or mute them or anything like that."
"20487420","20493920"," Now, if they don't, if I find somebody's shitting on anybody on Fintuit, and I go into their post"
"20493920","20499800"," history or even just response history, and they're just constantly shitting on people or it's"
"20499800","20504740"," constantly after the fact, shitting on people or like once I blocked somebody yesterday. "
"20505140","20510420"," Now, he didn't say anything to me, but he was in my feet a lot and I was following him."
"20511140","20517140"," So, I went, I scrolled over his name and I noticed that he'd unfollowed me."
"20518060","20519780"," So, I clicked on his profile. "
"20520460","20520960"," He had low follows."
"20521840","20528640"," I clicked on his profile and his post history was all after the fact negative."
"20529100","20533220"," Anything that went wrong, he commented on it or made a post about it after the fact. "
"20533740","20539740"," He had nothing before the fact and then in his response history, he was just shitting on people all"
"20539740","20540360"," over Fintuit."
"20541200","20543340"," Everywhere, it didn't matter who it was."
"20543560","20547180"," It was like on a bash like fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. "
"20547480","20548540"," So, I blocked that guy."
"20548840","20552660"," That guy, that guy lends zero value to Fintuit."
"20553520","20557400"," So, if you ever see that, even if you don't, even if you disagree with somebody, you can be, like"
"20557400","20561820"," you can either don't talk to him or do what everyone do, but if you see people doing that in"
"20561820","20566740"," Fintuit, I tend to block them or defend that person on Fintuit. "
"20566740","20569120"," But, well, there's a flip side to this though too."
"20570220","20571200"," There's a flip side to this."
"20572120","20576780"," There are some people that will shit on you and they actually bring you followers. "
"20577360","20583140"," So, if you get like somebody with like 1,000 followers or 5,000 followers or 10,000 followers or"
"20583140","20588540"," 20,000 followers, 100,000 followers and they shit on you, don't block them."
"20589120","20590940"," They actually bring you followers."
"20591820","20595000"," So, you want those people to be like fuck yeah shit on me. "
"20595000","20596980"," Take a big giant shit on top of me."
"20597180","20601480"," Then repost it on your stream, on your feed."
"20601900","20603380"," You're like yeah, this motherfucker hates me. "
"20604340","20607780"," And they will actually bring you followers that want to hate on you."
"20608000","20608760"," So, you'll get good followers."
"20627200","20628260"," No, they don't. "
"20628680","20630260"," CNBC wants nothing to do with me."
"20632260","20633440"," I don't think they like me."
"20634380","20638400"," They might like, there's a couple of people there that I follow and they follow me back, but I"
"20638400","20639620"," don't think they like a guy like me. "
"20640820","20642680"," I'm like the guy that they don't want to know."
"20657790","20660670"," I don't think that'll ever happen, but if it ever did, I'd probably decline."
"20661330","20661830"," I'll be honest. "
"20662410","20663590"," I've got to think about that for a second."
"20663670","20664210"," I'll probably decline."
"20666770","20668450"," I'll probably decline that offer. "
"20668870","20671650"," I don't want, there's something here but to talk about too."
"20672590","20673990"," I was thinking about this past week."
"20674410","20677310"," I fucking hate having 20,000 followers. "
"20678170","20679670"," I think I have 20,000 or something."
"20679890","20680510"," I fucking hate it."
"20680510","20683270"," I noticed about a month ago or something. "
"20683950","20688690"," I was like, man, everything I say means something to some extent to even if it's only a little bit."
"20689510","20690910"," And I don't ever want to have that."
"20691250","20696550"," If you have high follows, people expect anything you say is in stone and we're going to burn you"
"20696550","20697490"," the ground if it's wrong. "
"20698110","20698890"," They don't know if you're shit."
"20699010","20701190"," I've mixed a lot of shit posting with real stuff."
"20701870","20707330"," My handle is built around this whole thing that you have to follow me down the rabbit hole. "
"20707330","20710630"," You've got to go to the discord, go to the website, go to the fucking live stream, go to the"
"20710630","20711170"," fucking handle."
"20711430","20712770"," Then you've got to go over to the private handle."
"20713130","20713670"," All that shit. "
"20713850","20717330"," You've got to follow all of it to really know where I'm at on stuff."
"20718610","20721510"," It's coming to a point now where I can't do that anymore."
"20721990","20722550"," It sucks. "
"20724030","20732290"," At some point, you're going to see a watered down, you can't mix any of this stuff."
"20732290","20739450"," I'm hoping to move all that, all the legit stuff over to trade the trigger, that handle, and then"
"20739450","20742510"," just make Captain Jim James just a shit posting handle."
"20743150","20748790"," We have a nice low follower count, a thousand people, two thousand people, and just put out the"
"20748790","20750510"," straight shit right there. "
"20751050","20753690"," Straight face Captain Jim James all day long."
"20753690","20758730"," And maybe just I get kicked to the curb by the rest of Fin Twin on my regular handle or"
"20758730","20759370"," something like that."
"20768000","20769340"," Yeah, it's hard on Twitter. "
"20769720","20772820"," The more followers you get, the worse your experience becomes."
"20773440","20774280"," Do you guys know that?"
"20775140","20776540"," There's a real sweet spot."
"20776960","20783700"," Like a hundred followers to just about a thousand followers is a real fucking sweet spot. "
"20783700","20788460"," It starts to degrade from there until about ten thousand followers."
"20788960","20792820"," The moment you hit ten thousand followers, you start to really feel like I don't like this."
"20792960","20793480"," I don't like this. "
"20793960","20802100"," At twenty thousand, I noticed that I really have to start raining in who I am on that persona on"
"20802100","20802540"," Fin Twin."
"20803060","20806640"," And I've slowly been raining it in over time."
"20807460","20810900"," And eventually it'll likely have to become something like that. "
"20811520","20818980"," That kind of sucks because you know, there's like this view of who you play or there's like too"
"20818980","20824900"," much of an audience with certain expectations and they don't know the whole context of your"
"20824900","20825400"," conversation."
"20825400","20827300"," They're not following every post you make."
"20827960","20831740"," They're not you maybe you get reposted and then they're like, what's this fucking guy saying?"
"20832000","20834240"," They're not following you everywhere else. "
"20834240","20836080"," So that's a more consistency."
"20837460","20838720"," I'm not really a fan of it."
"20838780","20839400"," I'll be honest with you. "
"20839400","20845660"," I'm not really a fan of having followers on Fin Twin right now."
"20846060","20847460"," And I'm still getting them right now."
"20848500","20851720"," So I don't know what to do where I'm at right now with followers. "
"20852680","20855560"," The same thing goes for like, I mean, like it goes for anything."
"20856260","20862480"," You have like people that have high follows with, you know, like comedy on the market."
"20862980","20865200"," You don't want like, why are you getting serious right now?"
"20865200","20870420"," All I want you to do is post funny memes or, you know, like all I want out of you"
"20870420","20871460"," is this specific thing. "
"20872900","20878620"," So you kind of, no matter what your straight face is, if it's comedy, if it's shit posting, if it's"
"20878620","20885500"," anger, if it's doom, it's a full on bull, bull tired, right?"
"20886160","20889620"," Then they expect you to always be doing that when you start to get more followers."
"20891020","20896120"," And if you deviate from that, you get, you get real like anger thrown your way."
"20901160","20902260"," Yeah, I agree with that too. "
"20904140","20905560"," I agree with that to be harder."
"20909950","20910870"," What up, Goliath?"
"20912170","20912950"," What up, brother?"
"20915070","20915770"," What do you say?"
"20915930","20916750"," Yeah, yeah, switch accounts."
"20917090","20917890"," That's what I've been right. "
"20918070","20920230"," People have recommended to me to create an account."
"20921410","20924050"," Goliath is saying to make an alt account."
"20924470","20928990"," And I've talked, I haven't done it, but I want to do an alt account and just tell some of"
"20928990","20930410"," you, like, this is my alt here. "
"20930610","20934210"," It's not completely fucking separate, right?"
"20934570","20937130"," So you guys know that it's actually me, like the real me."
"20940450","20940870"," Boom."
"20945090","20948510"," And I'll tell you what, truth be told, right?"
"20950550","20956250"," About 50% of this audience here knew me when I had no followers, like none. "
"20957490","20959330"," You guys have been my friends since day one."
"20959410","20960550"," I've been your friends since day one."
"20960650","20961770"," I'll always trust you guys. "
"20962010","20962790"," I want you to know that too."
"20962890","20967770"," If you're in this stream here and you knew me when I had no followers, I will always trust you"
"20967770","20970950"," guys because I knew you before, right?"
"20971150","20972130"," You guys know me before."
"20972550","20974130"," We like each other because of who we are and stuff. "
"20974770","20980570"," I'll always value and keep those friendships close to me forever."
"20985410","20986490"," Yeah, John."
"20990650","20997930"," Yeah, Goliath is saying that he's on his alt account more than he is on his high follow account. "
"20998310","21003190"," If you guys out there have high follow accounts that you have alt accounts on so you can just kind"
"21003190","21003690"," of be yourself."
"21008590","21009250"," H bomb."
"21009430","21010530"," I've known you since day one. "
"21010790","21011250"," Fuck you."
"21019830","21021270"," Right on trading pennies."
"21021450","21021990"," Yeah, man. "
"21022110","21024990"," He's like a fucking horse lover."
"21024990","21027650"," Fat and I used to fuck around and hang out on fin twit, dude."
"21028130","21028390"," Right?"
"21031510","21032830"," What does that guy have now?"
"21033030","21035590"," Like 40, 50,000 followers or something stupid like that?"
"21041590","21044910"," Just like, you know, hanging out fucking chilling. "
"21045850","21047950"," You don't need, you don't need to be honest with you."
"21048010","21049290"," You don't need fucking a thousand followers."
"21049690","21055250"," Like you're like one of the greatest parts of fin twit is like a small group of followers. "
"21055670","21056270"," You follow them."
"21056270","21061130"," They follow you and you guys just have like the conversations that you fall into inside the"
"21061130","21061970"," comments of posts."
"21062910","21063570"," They're fucking awesome. "
"21063570","21065250"," I think they're great."
"21066610","21070870"," Like that you'll see like these just monster threads, these crazy inside jokes."
"21070870","21076790"," Like I think that's one of the one of the best qualities of fin twit is finding a group, a"
"21076790","21079890"," core group of friends and you're all shit posting with each other. "
"21079990","21081090"," Nobody's watching you."
"21081190","21083530"," Nobody cares what you're saying in that chat."
"21083810","21086270"," There isn't like fucking a thousand people watching the conversation. "
"21087590","21091810"," It's like, you know, you might think out there that it's a shitty place to only have a hundred"
"21091810","21094050"," followers is like the best place in fucking fin twit."
"21094550","21098730"," That's why I follow people with low follow counts, because I know that there's people with gangster"
"21098730","21101190"," shit out there and no one's following them."
"21101370","21103450"," So I'm like, I want to watch what the fuck they're talking about. "
"21103910","21107830"," I follow people with like sub 100 followers all the time, all the time."
"21109490","21113610"," I love like carrying in like opening the door and be like, what are you guys doing in there?"
"21120240","21121100"," Well, all right."
"21121380","21121940"," So we breached. "
"21123200","21124980"," Just, I got to post some fin twit."
"21213260","21232970"," Yeah, you"
"21232970","21234170"," want to hold this right here."
"21235950","21238450"," You want to hold this right here. "
"21249200","21251480"," There's a gamble level right here in the screen box."
"21259710","21264430"," You don't want if we if we break at any point below that green box right there, we will roll."
"21264430","21264910"," Okay. "
"21265090","21270270"," So the screen box must hold if you're watching that upside target and next level baby stuff down"
"21270270","21270550"," here."
"21273200","21275440"," So you want to be able to hold this down here."
"21275600","21277660"," You do not want to lose this level. "
"21277660","21279840"," And solidize down right here."
"21280100","21281600"," Fun assets fall to five spots."
"21281860","21283560"," Nine at six trillion dollars on the weekend. "
"21283780","21284660"," It January 17th."
"21285660","21293960"," So I'm going to remove it so you don't see it."
"21294000","21297580"," It's kind of clogging up the stream here, but you want to hold this right here. "
"21320840","21323340"," Disney investors are stinky right now."
"21323660","21355470"," Do you want"
"21355470","21359850"," to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for non farm payrolls?"
"21360390","21365910"," Then sign up today and get our special offer or financial use pro for years worth our service for"
"21365910","21368890"," the price of one month and say ninety two percent."
"21372070","21373250"," We're playing right there. "
"21373350","21373790"," Yeah, we're playing."
"21380830","21382150"," Early marks on closing balance."
"21382470","21384170"," Three hundred and eleven million to the bar side. "
"21391570","21395290"," When people use screen names allows for a lot of freedom and intellectual exploration."
"21395610","21396210"," I agree with that too."
"21396210","21400710"," We are losses, but still underperforming to start the year with the Russell two thousand down"
"21400710","21401850"," nearly six percent. "
"21401850","21405130"," Our next guest sees a bullish set up building in those charts."
"21405430","21406270"," Jeff to grab is the founder."
"21406470","21410650"," Yeah, I used to know man and for markets when he had no follows too. "
"21411010","21412330"," I used to be really close with him."
"21412450","21413870"," He's coming on the show too."
"21414730","21418250"," We have to schedule him, but he wants to be on the show as well at some point. "
"21418950","21420790"," We couldn't connect over the holiday."
"21421870","21422790"," He's on the list."
"21422790","21422910"," He's on the list. "
"21423010","21423450"," Greater podcast."
"21424890","21426330"," Yeah, I think we can."
"21426670","21427910"," People that want to come on the show. "
"21428150","21433810"," Last year where we had really impressive and you know, almost unprecedented."
"21434290","21435170"," We used to have trader."
"21435410","21438550"," We used to actually have mayhem on every morning. "
"21438550","21439830"," We first started the show."
"21439930","21440930"," Do you any guys remember that?"
"21441390","21443750"," We just have them on once a week or something like that."
"21443810","21444810"," So obviously there was. "
"21444970","21446110"," Well, once we could stop in."
"21447170","21448750"," So that helps set the stage."
"21449030","21449430"," Then we had. "
"21449430","21451010"," We're going to talk AMC."
"21452590","21455570"," And we got to talk GM at some point, don't we?"
"21456050","21458270"," We still haven't talked AMC and GME."
"21459830","21464270"," Jimmy, I haven't looked at AMC in a while, but last night I looked at GME. "
"21464990","21468170"," And I'll do it like GME is."
"21469230","21473730"," On the same track that Tesla is very, very bullish setup."
"21473730","21479470"," So, you know, we kind of look at this as a gift because oftentimes you'll just get a consolidation"
"21479470","21484050"," without really any type of meaningful price pullback in this, in this instance, we actually. "
"21484170","21485150"," We're probably we're going to wait."
"21485390","21485930"," I have four PM."
"21486190","21487930"," I'm going to look at AMC and GMC with you. "
"21488050","21488750"," I'm putting here."
"21488870","21489570"," I have four PM."
"21489930","21493710"," The charts that have pulled back have not structurally damaged themselves at all. "
"21493930","21495190"," They're back to their pivot points."
"21496070","21497130"," They actually look pretty good."
"21497330","21501050"," So if you're interested in looking at AMC and GME, we're going to look at it. "
"21501050","21505710"," This critical, critical levels that that jeopardizes the trend."
"21505910","21507110"," It all looks very orderly to us."
"21507570","21507830"," Right. "
"21508030","21512750"," So any essentially big picture you say we're playing by bull market rules based on how the market"
"21512750","21516750"," sort of proved itself to a degree last year with those momentum and breadth signals."
"21516950","21519010"," And what does it mean for the global markets?"
"21519210","21525370"," Because I also am interested that you felt like non US indexes have maybe you look a little riper"
"21525370","21526810"," for new money."
"21527610","21528730"," They're more sold. "
"21529030","21530030"," So you can make that case."
"21530110","21531710"," Speed is it all up?"
"21531790","21532710"," Probably not as strong."
"21533110","21535910"," Trade $2.30 right now for that squeeze higher. "
"21536190","21537610"," What set the ball you're on."
"21538170","21543870"," But all things considered when you look at the strength of the trends globally really with the"
"21543870","21547810"," exception of the hang sandwiches Hong Kong and in China."
"21548430","21550910"," The global trends are actually in very, very good shape. "
"21550910","21555410"," I mean the Japanese chart which I've been in this business for more than 30 years."
"21555630","21559010"," Japanese started to look good in 30 years since I've been in this business."
"21559390","21561390"," So it now looks very, very good. "
"21561790","21567270"," So I think it's easier to make a case or to at least have the foundation for a bull market"
"21567270","21572750"," domestically when we see similar patterns and similar trends globally."
"21572750","21577010"," And I think that's a big part that frankly, I don't think enough people are paying attention to."
"21577070","21579610"," They talk about the US market but they don't really look outside the US. "
"21580390","21584510"," And in many instances, you know, talk about European banks or European REITs."
"21584710","21590570"," They're actually stronger than what we have here in the States and those usually bode well for at"
"21590570","21591950"," least a good foundation."
"21592050","21597910"," It's not just some idiosyncratic move out of the US that we're trying to keep alive and fan the"
"21597910","21598150"," flames. "
"21598850","21600410"," It really is more global in nature."
"21600410","21601730"," So there's global heat out there."
"21601850","21603930"," I think that's good news for the S&P. "
"21604270","21608970"," And obviously one of the reasons that the US has managed to stand above the rest of the world is"
"21608970","21612850"," the dominance of a big tech, one description or another."
"21613210","21618730"," Has there been a reason to question whether tech and related stocks remain in a leadership"
"21618730","21619270"," position?"
"21619510","21623530"," Everyone seems to want to bet against the 493, against the Magnificent Seven."
"21623810","21624390"," Does that make sense?"
"21625410","21629570"," I mean, look at some point it does, but that's kind of what's saying you're one day closer to"
"21629570","21629870"," dying. "
"21629870","21633710"," I mean, you know, that's a true statement, but it doesn't really give you a lot of a lot of"
"21633710","21635230"," comfort or information."
"21636210","21638270"," Look, the relative trends are still good."
"21638750","21644530"," The data that we look at that gives us some indication of when we want to start fighting those"
"21644530","21644850"," trends. "
"21645570","21651310"," Basically, risk adjusted type of returns are not so excessive as to suggest that trees are growing"
"21651310","21652090"," to the sky there."
"21652310","21656710"," So I'm a little shocked by it, frankly, but the data is the data and still so that they're more"
"21656710","21656950"," there."
"21657750","21661070"," I think we might get, I mean, if we want to get cute with this, I think if we go"
"21661070","21666710"," back and look at the 1995 parallel when the Fed cut rates and really kind of engineered the last"
"21666710","21667350"," soft landing. "
"21668410","21673890"," What we had was tech actually did well up until the first rate cut, and then it kind of went"
"21673890","21678390"," by the wayside as other things started to dominate, like banks as an example."
"21678930","21683050"," And that might be, I don't think it's the perfect playbook, but that might be a twist here that"
"21683050","21687830"," things are very good as the eyes are on the Fed to cut rates sometime"
"21687830","21697310"," in the spring."
"21698230","21699390"," That's one that we're circling. "
"21700150","21703690"," I see, on Vixxin, a five-minute chart, I've got a double bear cross."
"21704850","21707150"," I'd be watching out for a squeeze into the close."
"21707530","21708110"," Someone was out there. "
"21708310","21712670"," What TNX is waking up, I see that Tesla waking up here."
"21717670","21719470"," You think Tesla's going to turn here?"
"21719630","21722390"," I see that bounce on Tesla in the middle of the afternoon."
"21727310","21730530"," They tend to flock together, forget the pun about it, being an aerospace name. "
"21731170","21733850"," But those charts generally are good charts."
"21734210","21738170"," So we like to look for opportunities within good industry groups."
"21738830","21746570"," The big, huge base really in Boeing, kind of coming back from the max 737 problems that they had,"
"21746630","21748850"," obviously, was a nice breakout. "
"21749290","21749830"," It looks great."
"21750090","21750750"," It's in enough trend."
"21751310","21754930"," What we really try to do is find names that are oversold in up trends. "
"21755310","21759070"," We call those optimal entries for our clients, and we alert them to those."
"21759450","21763650"," We started getting some of those signals back last week, but what we really look for is that hook."
"21763870","21768090"," Some type of momentum to say that the downside being recognized and probably fleshed out. "
"21768190","21770790"," I think today is actually a very good example of that."
"21771010","21777590"," So optimal entry for us in Boeing, it held support, which is essentially 180, and we think it's"
"21777590","21778830"," going to resume the trend to the upside."
"21779750","21780770"," Jeff, great to catch up. "
"21780930","21781430"," Thanks so much."
"21782010","21782410"," Thank you."
"21782570","21782810"," See you later. "
"21783130","21783610"," All right."
"21783770","21783970"," Up next."
"21784430","21786690"," We're tracking the biggest movers as we head into the close. "
"21786910","21788730"," Kate Rooney standing by with those, Kate."
"21789090","21789530"," Hey, Mike."
"21789730","21789790"," Yeah. "
"21789930","21794770"," So if there are calls from Morgan Stanley and sending two stocks to charge in opposite directions,"
"21794770","21799490"," into the close, we're going to tell you which stock is jumping 8%, and which beaten down name is at"
"21799490","21800010"," a four-year low."
"21800190","21801370"," That's all when we come right back."
"21846380","21847920"," Three thirty seven right now. "
"21978980","21983020"," Early marks and closing balance, still sitting at three hundred and eleven million to the bar side."
"22003430","22007870"," Oh, here comes that fucking ram macro headline risk with financial use pro."
"22008410","22011630"," Now only $99 a year for our real time service. "
"22015550","22020650"," We're bouncing retesting the gamma support down below an SPX right now."
"22020970","22024870"," So the OCC Fed and SD on your eye on this right here."
"22024970","22025890"," Keep your eye right here. "
"22025950","22026170"," Okay."
"22026310","22029630"," So we call it the Bell S&P up about three quarters of one percent right here."
"22030230","22034630"," This is the four, seven, seven, five level right here. "
"22034850","22039530"," Hey, we're going to start with our shares or jumping after the analyst at Morgan Stanley."
"22039530","22043750"," Upgraded the statute over way, the investment firm cheering on the rent-to-car company's decision"
"22043750","22048870"," to sell about 20,000 electric vehicles from its fleet and says that should help boost the stock."
"22049030","22049810"," And then you got plug power. "
"22050290","22053070"," Down after the fuel sale company announced new financing plans."
"22053270","22057030"," It does plan to raise more than a billion dollars by selling new shares in that new round of"
"22057030","22061890"," financing would dilute existing shareholders and represent a massive part of the company's existing"
"22061890","22063930"," $1.5 billion market cap."
"22064110","22064750"," Mike, back over here. "
"22065010","22066190"," All right, Chris Rooney."
"22066490","22066770"," Thank you."
"22067950","22068990"," 30 soon, Kate. "
"22069450","22070070"," Still ahead."
"22070630","22071570"," Your regional bank rundown."
"22072010","22074690"," Several reporting earlier with more on debt tomorrow morning. "
"22075030","22077750"," We'll hear from a top analyst with all the key themes and metrics."
"22077750","22082430"," We're reading into this Dennis U.S. regulators on preparing to introduce a plan to a plan to"
"22082430","22087290"," require banks to happen to the Fed's discount window at least once a year in order to reduce stigma"
"22087290","22089650"," and until vendors are ready for troubled times."
"22172760","22174320"," Congratulations, Joey Donut. "
"22176000","22180540"," Joey Donut sold half of 479 C for tomorrow with 82% profit."
"22180720","22181120"," Hells."
"22181240","22181640"," Yeah, brother. "
"22182620","22184180"," Money is money, man."
"22189670","22190990"," Congratulations, Joe."
"22191850","22200290"," I know, I know, I know. "
"22201330","22204230"," You're trading safe with with Capit, Joe."
"22205530","22208410"," We buy the actual bottom and let the weirdos."
"22209870","22211130"," Get trapped in the tops. "
"22225310","22226530"," Joshua L, I see that."
"22229090","22229790"," Nice, Josh."
"22262230","22263890"," We do the creepy crawl up the wall here. "
"22264010","22264750"," Is that what you guys are picking?"
"22264750","22270970"," I want to show you guys this here on Webull here, okay, on this level down here."
"22270990","22272790"," This is not looking good for bears here."
"22274350","22275630"," We've got the upside target. "
"22275750","22280450"," We hit that, but then above we've got the next level by it."
"22280530","22281150"," I'll tell you what."
"22281350","22286630"," When you see shit like this down here, when you see some confident like that. "
"22286730","22289150"," If you break this previous high, you know what that means, right?"
"22290470","22292830"," Straight the fuck up or at least in cash market."
"22294130","22300530"," After cash market, they're probably sell futures, but just be aware of this bounce here."
"22301130","22304330"," Pretty fucking bullish, so we'll see if they can break it. "
"22304470","22309070"," What you want to see is this green bar."
"22309250","22312870"," You want to see it just slightly higher like right above right here."
"22313310","22315450"," Come back down and then boom to the upside. "
"22316670","22319150"," We'll watch this and see if it actually happens or not."
"22319150","22326370"," Be aware that momentum will leave the market after the close and then you're going to get dealers"
"22326370","22328350"," selling into you at night time."
"22329230","22334330"," We should have dealers in the overnight selling into the overnight here, so we'll see. "
"22334670","22337010"," But there's a little bit of finagling into Friday."
"22337550","22342690"," They might try to ramp it up and to print their op-ex stuff."
"22344250","22347850"," But just be aware that after the close that you're losing the momentum to the upside. "
"22347850","22348930"," That's the key thing."
"22350070","22351910"," What up, duckhand, Dougie?"
"22352870","22353770"," What up, bro?"
"22358510","22360130"," What up, duckhand, Dougie?"
"22362190","22363190"," That's been a good day."
"22363270","22363510"," I'm stoked. "
"22363770","22364270"," I made money today."
"22364370","22364790"," I'm happy."
"22365550","22368210"," I made money in the open, made money on a fucking zero-date trade. "
"22368670","22370790"," It was the only trade that I fucking took today with you guys."
"22371450","22372450"," And it was the right trade."
"22372790","22374950"," So fucking outstanding day today. "
"22374950","22376810"," I had a trader podcast on."
"22377170","22379330"," The vault signals was on this morning in the chat."

"22383670","22386610"," I want to see Mero in the chat blowing us up down here."
"22391770","22393370"," Do me a solid here if you can. "
"22394210","22397590"," If you want, I'm going to give you guys some free stuff here if you don't already have it."
"22398170","22400770"," We have a handle called at Captain's Alpha."

"22454910","22456270"," Here's a Discord invite. "
"22466220","22467800"," Then we've got what else?"
"22468840","22475720"," You can also, as we are launching, you definitely want to sign up on the Discord and sign up on"

"22511730","22513010"," I send them out only when needed. "
"22513390","22519910"," So I also make posts on that website that are exclusive as well for people that just sign up."
"22520310","22520930"," What else we got?"
"22521750","22523110"," We got anything else we can give away?"
"22523310","22523570"," I don't know."

"22556350","22558930"," Apple up, say 3.2% right now."
"22558930","22561050"," It's the biggest upside contributor to the S&P."
"22562170","22563010"," Give me a saw. "
"22563210","22563650"," Well, that's not anything."
"22563770","22564130"," That's what I forgot."
"22564410","22569590"," So if you could, please, if you're on YouTube, can you please like the video and possibly make a"
"22569590","22573650"," comment in the comments section down below, not the side one for the live stream. "
"22573710","22576230"," But just in the comments, be like, I hate fucking Jim James."
"22576230","22576730"," He sucks."
"22577610","22578590"," Something like that. "
"22579070","22580430"," Whatever you say, it doesn't matter."

"22625530","22629510"," I think also Bork has a link to it on how to chat for free."
"22630210","22632110"," So there is an option for you to chat for free here."
"22632330","22633030"," Always will be. "
"22634110","22635630"," If you want to sign up that way."

"22642330","22643270"," I didn't know that."
"22643310","22644370"," What's surprising about that?"
"22644370","22644850"," I didn't know that."
"22644930","22646230"," Thanks for the heads up on that, Andre. "
"22646850","22648050"," Just the like would work."

"22653790","22656450"," Squeezing on up to the top. "
"22657530","22658710"," Squeezing on up."
"22660890","22662110"," Here's the upside target."
"22662110","22663050"," We already hit it, right?"
"22664070","22665210"," And then we got what?"
"22665410","22666650"," We had the back test on gamma. "

"22669510","22670550"," Where are we going?"
"22672870","22678350"," As we go up here, if you're long calls, it's three fifty when we got nine minutes left."
"22678390","22681530"," As we squeeze up in the belt and creepy crawly up the wall."
"22683710","22685350"," Remember to monetize. "

"22702870","22704790"," The capture QRA risk."
"22705830","22708110"," That doesn't matter what QRA does. "
"22708530","22710010"," Just the risk associated with it."
"22710030","22712390"," It's a trend that's now becoming much clearer."
"22712730","22715970"," Medicare patients are having more electric surgery procedures. "
"22715970","22719490"," Humana now warning that each fourth quarter medical loss ratio."
"22719730","22723010"," That's the percentage of the premium that's spent on medical costs."
"22723390","22725510"," Well, top ninety one percent. "
"22725510","22728770"," That's two hundred and forty basis points above consensus."
"22729370","22734190"," And as a note, insurers M.L.R. rarely top eighty nine percent."
"22734470","22740190"," Meantime, Humana is blaming it on high inpatient costs as well as outpatient surgeries. "
"22740490","22743530"," The same as what we heard from United Health last week."
"22743530","22748930"," But unlike UNH, Humana says this is hitting its full year twenty twenty three."
"22750390","22754710"," On top of that, the insurer also warned that it's a higher attrition. "
"22755170","22758830"," And lower new member growth during the Medicare open enrollment season recently."
"22758830","22764270"," And now projects twenty twenty four Medicare membership growth will be up just one point eight"
"22764270","22764730"," percent."
"22765330","22769310"," Which is below the industry average that we're looking at for this year. "
"22769870","22774530"," All right, yeah, and this move obviously has ripple effects across the sector birth."
"22774590","22775130"," But thank you."
"22775470","22776750"," So Joe, does it change anything?"
"22777010","22781110"," I mean, it seems like higher utilization is something that maybe we can think about being front"
"22781110","22783750"," loaded into last year before premiums go off. "
"22783750","22786110"," As we close, if you are a bull."
"22792740","22794000"," Then ladies and gentlemen."
"22799200","22816450"," On to"
"22816450","22817790"," the code of day boys and girls. "
"22819770","22851620"," Oh, wow."
"22862160","22865320"," Jared, thank you for subscribing on the website, brother."
"22866580","22868400"," Thanks for coming in, member. "
"22869440","22870580"," Be frank, baby."
"22870880","22871260"," What's up?"
"22872280","22873140"," 40 max."
"22873540","22873860"," What's up?"
"22874940","22875920"," Sorry, old man. "
"22876100","22876280"," Tiger."
"22876540","22876840"," What's up?"
"22877080","22877200"," Check."
"22877600","22877960"," Camp 2000. "
"22878720","22879280"," What's going on?"
"22881200","22883620"," Oh, signals becoming a member."
"22884340","22886920"," George Pavlogos became a trainer."
"22886920","22887700"," Be harder. "
"22888000","22888300"," 12."
"22889000","22889940"," Antimax wins."
"22890740","22893140"," Jaystep, by the way, tens, health care. "
"22893340","22894400"," Let me back to back."
"22895640","22896240"," Perfect."
"22897820","22899520"," You know, California. "
"22900520","22901060"," What's up, brother?"
"22902020","22902620"," Spaceman."
"22903060","22903280"," Alex."

"22904660","22905260"," Greenman."
"22905720","22907280"," Johnny on the spot, baby."
"22908200","22909880"," Revival back and on. "
"22924060","22944620"," We have 1000"
"22944620","22946820"," people signed up on the website, Julie."
"22947540","22949060"," Go to your brother."
"22973950","22975690"," A thousand people signed up. "
"22975970","22977010"," Jesus Christ."
"22997430","23000130"," Well, we've heard this music in a while, haven't we?"
"23006430","23008090"," Well, let's see what else we got here."
"23012930","23014930"," And, oh, there's a good one right there. "
"23015810","23017450"," This one a long time either."
"23018230","23019670"," Three minutes left until market close."
"23020630","23022490"," What are my expectations for tomorrow?"
"23023010","23024710"," A market in higher?"
"23026470","23029990"," This is the beginning of the place that you look for, right?"
"23029990","23031070"," We talked about that. "
"23031570","23040290"," Anything between the upside target and the next level, baby."
"23041750","23045350"," Start looking for a put spread in the money."
"23045970","23049630"," Expiring on January 31. "
"23050510","23052630"," Don't go crazy to the downside on it."
"23053310","23055190"," Just slap it on, leave it on."
"23057630","23062950"," I think tomorrow is the day to place the trade, but if you are going to place it today, probably,"
"23063090","23064450"," probably going to print out of that. "
"23068490","23070670"," I want to thank you for coming to the show today."
"23070970","23075230"," After the bell, we're going to review AMC and GME."
"23076730","23099530"," Oh, I"
"23099530","23099810"," remember. "
"23100190","23101370"," We haven't played this in a while."
"23101570","23102010"," Hold on here."
"23102190","23102790"," We're going to try this one out. "
"23106140","23107080"," Which one is it?"
"23107340","23109480"," I think it's the E Jimmy Jams or something like that."
"23111400","23112300"," This one."
"23112580","23113520"," There we go. "
"23113680","23115840"," We haven't played this one forever."
"23161850","23162950"," I shouldn't say that."
"23163010","23163830"," I'm going to delete that one. "
"23189550","23199350"," This is the"
"23199350","23199830"," same guy."
"23201010","23202790"," You guys remember this song?"
"23203170","23203990"," You haven't played this shit forever."
"23215630","23216590"," 4pm, baby. "
"23218030","23220110"," I'll catch up with all of you tomorrow."
"23221050","23222190"," 930 in the morning."
"23223110","23224310"," Friends of you wear those. "
"23224570","23225410"," I want to stick around."
"23225750","23227130"," Look at GME and AMC."
"23227610","23228270"," I know for sure. "
"23229510","23229990"," AMC."
"23232510","23236570"," Our GME definitely needs a look at that."
"23236930","23238150"," It's looking sketchy. "
"23238210","23238990"," It's just like Tesla."
"23241810","23242550"," 930, baby."
"23254730","23255730"," Alright, here we go. "
"23256110","23256550"," 4pm."
"23257030","23259870"," If you're going to exit the show, I'll see you all tomorrow."
"23260550","23261790"," Thank you for showing up today. "
"23262090","23266270"," I appreciate all of the alpha that we see in the chat every day."
"23266770","23268550"," Really, truly appreciate that."
"23268730","23269850"," You guys are fucking awesome. "
"23270110","23270610"," Everybody in the chat."
"23271230","23272170"," Thank you for being here."
"23272310","23274450"," If you watched rebroadcast this stream. "
"23274750","23277790"," If you're in another country and you're watching this in a rebroadcast."
"23278130","23278210"," Hello."
"23278890","23281410"," If you're in a discord right now in a rebroadcast. "
"23281930","23283210"," Thank you for joining us."
"23283490","23285630"," I've had people say they rebroadcast us elsewhere."
"23286070","23289990"," They've contacted me via email and inside the chat they say, hey, Cap, is it okay if we stream?"
"23290470","23293370"," So if you're out there watching us, thank you very much for tuning in every day. "
"23293870","23297470"," I will see all of you tomorrow for the rest of you wear those out there."
"23298710","23300150"," We're going to get a little intimate."
"23302630","23304450"," We're going to take some serious looks here. "
"23305410","23307350"," We're going to put a straight face again."
"23308150","23316450"," And the reason for that is because of what we need to take a serious look specifically at some"
"23316450","23320450"," tickers that people are very emotional about, right?"
"23321230","23323350"," So we're going to go over to the trigger screen here."
"23324270","23327610"," And we're going to take a peek at first GME. "
"23329650","23331550"," And why did it peak my interest?"
"23331550","23336550"," First of all, I was on FinTwit briefly yesterday."
"23338150","23340270"," I was like, I was like, I got to go."
"23340570","23341750"," And then I came back on FinTwit. "
"23342270","23344450"," And I was going through because I suck."
"23345550","23346290"," I do."
"23346390","23352350"," I really suck because I don't have enough time to be inside the notifications. "
"23353610","23357550"," I get so many notifications that I burn like an hour just doing that."
"23358210","23359230"," So I'm like, fuck this."
"23359330","23361890"," I'm going to check my notifications more frequently. "
"23362350","23363530"," And then my DM, same thing."
"23364090","23367450"," 20 DM's a day, 20 DM's a day, 20 DM's a day."
"23367530","23370170"," And it's really hard to do follow up. "
"23370330","23372150"," So I've been trying to do more follow up recently."
"23372730","23374390"," And someone asked yesterday about GME."
"23374850","23379870"," They said, when squeeze, they said, when is squeeze on GME?"
"23380250","23382130"," Now, they said this yesterday, right?"
"23383330","23385390"," And this today is the 18th, right?"
"23385390","23390310"," And we got the 18th, 17th right here in the squeeze today on GME. "
"23390830","23392890"," Nice little squeeze, right?"
"23393190","23395590"," And I said something about violence coming for GME."
"23396470","23399330"," And why is there violence coming for GME?"
"23401690","23402930"," And what does it mean?"
"23403150","23404010"," And you can see the squeeze."
"23404350","23405730"," So we had this squeeze right here, right?"
"23406550","23410730"," And then we had this big squeeze right here with this giant squeeze today, right?"
"23411670","23412370"," On GME. "
"23412370","23414630"," Why is violence coming to GME?"
"23415150","23416110"," What does it all mean?"
"23416870","23419590"," And why is it important right now in GME?"
"23420490","23421510"," Why does it matter?"
"23421770","23425930"," And we're going to show you, I'm going to show you in a larger timeframe what matters here with GME"
"23425930","23427710"," and why it matters, the importance of it."
"23428390","23432870"," And I felt like this person that I talked to yesterday and sent to it, I was like, we got"
"23432870","23433550"," some violence coming."
"23434990","23439470"," And it's very similar in nature to Tesla in some way. "
"23440410","23446990"," So we're going to go first start out with a daily chart on GME."
"23450290","23451830"," And why does this matter?"
"23452970","23455110"," And I'm going to show you right here why it matters."
"23455490","23460630"," I want to show you historically for GME, where some real problems lie here. "
"23461110","23462490"," And I'm going to point out the first one."
"23463290","23464510"," And that's right here."
"23465410","23469770"," When you get these crosses, right, you get this daily and weekly cross-negative. "
"23470490","23473410"," And then you get a weekly and daily cross of the monthly."
"23474570","23478490"," You see some real downside violence in the ticker."
"23479090","23480290"," Keep it really simple here. "
"23480890","23481790"," Really fucking simple."
"23482070","23482150"," Okay."
"23483010","23485110"," Same thing that will happen right here. "
"23485290","23485410"," Okay."
"23486230","23488370"," And it was really, really bad."
"23489050","23492230"," I remember when this happened, it was fucking ugly. "
"23492590","23494710"," I was a member of Wall Street, that's when that happened."
"23494710","23498170"," So there's two examples, okay, of this happening."
"23498930","23501230"," Two prior examples, one and two. "
"23501710","23504930"," And what does that mean for right now is the question."
"23506990","23508310"," It's happening again."
"23510170","23520130"," Now it hasn't happened yet, but price and the daily trigger took place"
"23520130","23520730"," right here. "
"23520730","23525270"," And we have a blast down right here, bouncing blast down right here."
"23525270","23530670"," And now sitting on the six month trigger."
"23533410","23536750"," That's cause for concern on itself. "
"23537230","23538530"," It's major cause for concern."
"23538930","23540850"," Doesn't mean the bear share on GME."
"23541610","23546470"," I personally would like to see this bounce and hold on the six month. "
"23547250","23548950"," If you're a bull, you got to hold this."
"23548950","23549910"," You have to."
"23550290","23554210"," And there's some violence coming from above right now. "
"23554370","23556970"," We've got the monthly trigger."
"23557310","23558130"," This is that bear."
"23558950","23564570"," This is that when prices below that bear and you've got the weekly cross right here. "
"23565150","23569570"," And now you're looking at a cross to the downside of the six month trigger."
"23570490","23571010"," Okay."
"23571190","23573210"," Now I'm not saying we're there right now, but I am. "
"23573370","23573730"," We aren't."
"23573790","23577770"," We bounced and we bounced to get in ricocheted, but I'm scared of it."
"23578530","23578790"," Okay. "
"23579030","23580790"," This monthly comes down right here."
"23580970","23583710"," You get the you get like an eight trigger compares cluster."
"23584430","23587870"," And it could be it could be brutal for GME. "
"23588230","23590630"," Now my calling for that brutality and Jimmy."
"23591350","23592310"," Not so fast."
"23594990","23596190"," Looking down here. "
"23596910","23598070"," We had it back here."
"23598170","23598590"," You see this?"
"23599670","23601530"," We have the start of it right here."
"23602390","23604970"," And this weekly is getting a little long in the tooth. "
"23605550","23610250"," You'd need the great alliance of all this stuff at the same time, but I want you to see this"
"23610250","23610630"," right here."
"23610750","23610930"," Okay."
"23612330","23613750"," Bad news right there, right?"
"23614150","23617070"," We have a little bit of that starting right now. "
"23617730","23620910"," Not quite there yet, but it doesn't look good."
"23621690","23622170"," Okay."
"23622390","23624650"," So this here is a warning shot across your bow. "
"23624710","23628590"," If you are a GME bull."
"23629270","23629750"," Okay."
"23629990","23631510"," There's a little cannon back here and there's a."
"23633250","23636670"," The cannon ball right here telling you to be careful here. "
"23637610","23639350"," In a pretty significant way."
"23639630","23643290"," Not all know if that means GME is going to declare bankruptcy."
"23644570","23647830"," A lot of you out there are going to say, Oh, we just need to close the gap down here. "
"23647890","23649250"," Cap and it's going to run again."
"23650690","23651090"," Right."
"23651470","23651910"," Come down here. "
"23651990","23653690"," Close the gap and then it's going to be another squeeze."
"23656430","23657230"," For GME."
"23657450","23660590"," So what I want to talk to you guys about here say a little blip down here. "
"23660590","23661590"," It's really nothing."
"23661750","23665530"," Is it a little squeeze really too much?"
"23665530","23669970"," Is it so we're going to look at a 30 minute chart here on GME."
"23676370","23678970"," And I don't like this rejection here. "
"23679070","23680910"," Do you see all this rejection right here in the weekly?"
"23681810","23683290"," Sellers are coming down on you in the weekly."
"23683510","23689810"," They're coming down on you in the daily and they're confirming more downside to come prices."
"23689810","23692850"," It looks like it's above the hourly right now. "
"23692970","23697070"," But this brings true volatility to the stock as my point to the downside."
"23697990","23700010"," And I guess it could be upside too."
"23700570","23701890"," So this is what I'm going to say to you. "
"23705510","23709530"," You're at a place right now with price on GME."
"23710690","23713990"," Where it is critical that you get above this monthly trigger here."
"23714670","23715310"," It is critical. "
"23716430","23719770"," It's not good enough that you get above the daily trigger, the weekly trigger."
"23720350","23723430"," None of that stuff is important enough."
"23723550","23725170"," But I'm going to show you why here at a large time frame. "
"23725270","23726910"," It's not the six month is not showing up here."
"23727290","23728650"," But I'm going to post it right here."
"23728770","23728910"," Okay. "
"23729770","23731530"," You're on a bull plane than a bear plane."
"23731970","23734170"," But on this $13 right here."
"23735810","23737630"," That $13 right there. "
"23737790","23737890"," Okay."
"23739110","23741310"," 1333, 1336 stuff like that."
"23741510","23742410"," Is that still showing now?"
"23747210","23749310"," So I'm going to say this to you if you're a GME bull. "
"23749970","23751950"," You cannot give up that $13."
"23751950","23754650"," You fucking cannot give this up."
"23759830","23760450"," Cannot. "
"23762330","23763790"," Give this price up."
"23766440","23767240"," You cannot."
"23767980","23771900"," If you do and you break that six month trigger down here. "
"23774310","23778910"," If you break that six month trigger and you start to have that daily trigger."
"23779750","23780910"," That weekly trigger."
"23782130","23784910"," And where's that monthly trigger right there. "
"23787370","23791150"," You have the confluence of all of this stuff heading down."
"23792310","23793950"," All of this stuff heading down."
"23794190","23795310"," All of this stuff heading down. "
"23797090","23799110"," You can't deal with a rejection here."
"23799350","23800870"," You can't deal with a rejection here."
"23801090","23806870"," You can't deal with a rejection here because it's going to be a fucking blood bath to the downside. "
"23807450","23807890"," I mean it."
"23808690","23810650"," We're talking like 80 cents."
"23812370","23812850"," Possibility. "
"23814410","23815650"," Really bad stuff."
"23816070","23817470"," Now some of you going to think to yourself."
"23818130","23818830"," No cap. "
"23819090","23823150"," All it's going to do is go down to going to close this gap down here when I do another"
"23823150","23823490"," run."
"23824130","23827090"," So in your view, you're likely probably telling yourself."
"23827690","23828450"," No cap. "
"23830110","23831910"," We're going to slam down here."
"23832630","23834250"," It's going to be often to the races."
"23835210","23837030"," I tend to disagree with you on this. "
"23838170","23840730"," The momentum that's coming down upon your head."
"23841390","23845530"," Down here is likely going to seek a new low."
"23847490","23851810"," And I think the low was the low at 60 cents or 80 cents or something like that. "
"23851990","23852610"," Way back in the day."
"23852670","23853230"," Where was it at?"
"23853750","23854210"," Find out."
"23854550","23855030"," I can't remember. "
"23855190","23855830"," It's been a long time."
"23860690","23861610"," 68 cents."
"23863730","23865730"," So I don't know if that's forecasting. "
"23867370","23868610"," Something really bad."
"23869610","23870210"," Clear bankruptcy."
"23870210","23873250"," And you see this right here. "
"23873370","23874690"," This is your yearly trigger."
"23874990","23875850"," You see this right here?"
"23876790","23878130"," To that trigger right there?"
"23880330","23881530"," That's your yearly trigger."
"23885620","23886660"," That's my target. "
"23888880","23890840"," This is your prior target right here."
"23894030","23894910"," That's two cents."
"23896070","23896870"," Two pennies. "
"23899730","23901930"," You understand the point that I'm trying to make you here?"
"23905880","23907960"," So there's either bankruptcy coming."
"23910460","23911300"," It's possible."
"23912120","23913380"," We're getting that read. "
"23916230","23917730"," You cannot give this up."
"23918830","23919750"," I guess you can."
"23920010","23921710"," Some of you probably think you can down here. "
"23922290","23923830"," I don't like seeing this down here."
"23924290","23926290"," And I don't like seeing this down here either."
"23926810","23930510"," And I don't want to see GME at 60 cents or two cents. "
"23931610","23933150"," That says bust."
"23933150","23939960"," So if you're GME bull, it doesn't mean sell."
"23941220","23945100"," It means something, though, too, if you're our GME bull. "
"23945820","23949000"," If you are along the underlying on GME, I'm going to give you a warning."
"23951140","23952380"," If you want to hold."
"23953360","23954440"," HDOL, right?"
"23954720","23954960"," HODL. "
"23956560","23960140"," It might behoove you to have some protection here."
"23962100","23963860"," And I'm going to put it to you this way."
"23964420","23974150"," If you protect yourself with some really fucking bad puts or cheap puts"
"23974150","23975090"," that are worthless. "
"23977830","23979290"," Joe Donut used to tell me this."
"23980090","23984330"," If the world is going to, if we're going to have a nuclear war, go long."
"23985810","23987250"," And you might say, why go long?"
"23988550","23991230"," Well, because the worst that can happen is we're all gone, right?"
"23991930","23993190"," You weren't going to get paid anyways. "
"23993550","23994610"," You're not going to owe anybody any money."
"23994610","23996250"," You're not going to need your money."
"23997230","23998210"," You don't need it. "
"23999010","23999890"," World's blown up."
"24001190","24006790"," So if you're long already, if you're a GME bull, I might take some protection out."
"24007770","24016450"," Like penny puts that only prints if we trade $4.98. It's like a $5 put. "
"24019660","24026400"," Now, if we do bounce here, if this is the actual bottom, cannot give up this price, you're not"
"24026400","24029320"," going to care about those puts."
"24029920","24034940"," Or if they burn, you're not going to care because this is the place that should be the bottom."
"24035300","24037540"," This should be the bottom. "
"24037700","24038500"," You get what I'm saying here?"
"24039280","24041900"," So this is the bottom for GME."
"24043320","24046660"," The way down from here is a fucking mess."
"24047560","24048720"," It is a hot mess. "
"24049460","24051220"," So this is the place to buy GME."
"24051220","24054100"," Or if you've held to this point, don't fucking sell."
"24054600","24056080"," Throw on some outside the money puts. "
"24057000","24057940"," Date them out far."
"24058280","24064040"," I would date them out for at least a month and a half past mid-March."
"24064400","24066300"," So I'd take those for like May or something. "
"24068100","24072300"," And then I would monetize them on the seasonal low for the stock market in mid-March."
"24074240","24077000"," Or let them burn if we never go down there."
"24077000","24078440"," But this is a point. "
"24078740","24079540"," This is a place."
"24079880","24086260"," I got to say this because some of you know me from James Rowland, right?"
"24087520","24090260"," And some of you guys have seen me in James Rowland's Discord."
"24091140","24094020"," Some of you guys have known me pre-GME. "
"24094720","24095900"," There are people on fint with it."
"24096080","24098160"," Know me from pre-GME."
"24098960","24100220"," Some of you out there know me. "
"24100220","24102320"," And you guys have seen me trade."
"24102440","24103160"," Luck and coffee."
"24103880","24105060"," You've seen me trade. "
"24105220","24106300"," You've seen me trade."
"24106920","24107480"," Hurts."
"24107960","24108860"," You've seen me trade. "
"24109540","24110580"," Everything out there."
"24110700","24111780"," Any meme stock out there."
"24111980","24114240"," And I got to give you a fucking warning here. "
"24115900","24120920"," If that bad thing happens, it's horrible."
"24122200","24125380"," The last leg down is horrible."
"24126900","24130500"," And you see people just get fucking destroyed. "
"24131920","24136040"," And I remember I think it was hurts, but I could be wrong."
"24137160","24140820"," I did a show inside of James's Discord."
"24141720","24145580"," And we talked about, you know, ride this and pump that and buy this and all this other stuff. "
"24145700","24150160"," But we also had a conversation in that stream where, or that discussion where I said, you know, if"
"24150160","24154040"," we get below a certain price, get the fuck out and run."
"24154040","24155280"," And that happened."
"24155940","24158060"," You know, and people got fucking annihilated. "
"24159200","24163480"," So I got to do that fair warning to you as a GME bull."
"24163620","24164860"," It's not probably not what you want to hear."
"24165460","24166200"," Probably not. "
"24168220","24170740"," You know, it's probably going to piss some of you off and stuff like that."
"24171420","24172640"," But I need you to have that warning."
"24172820","24179480"," So I need you to know that there's a wave of momentum coming down on the price of GME. "
"24180460","24182560"," Vicious momentum coming down up top."
"24182760","24183900"," It couldn't lead to a squeeze."
"24184780","24187260"," It can lead to a new new life for GME. "
"24188460","24190220"," But I want you to be aware of it."
"24190260","24190420"," Okay."
"24191240","24192800"," So some key levels for you. "
"24193280","24197860"," I want you to understand some key levels here for GME before you leave the stream here."
"24199480","24203300"," And your key levels are $13.49. It's a key level."
"24204880","24218130"," Your next key level is $15.71, $16.83, $18.72. And"
"24218130","24224870"," then currently $22.96. So this will likely be about 20 bucks at some point. "
"24226470","24233550"," I really, really, really, the life of me want to see price above $20."
"24236070","24241890"," If you want to see the next three to four months, I want to see the next three to four"
"24241890","24247150"," months, I want to see price fight and break above the hourly trigger."
"24247950","24249710"," I'm going to draw it out for you right here. "
"24249850","24249930"," Okay."
"24250030","24251090"," I want to show you what I want to see."
"24251210","24251430"," Okay. "
"24252070","24252910"," The next six months."
"24253130","24258210"," I want to want you to know what I want to see out of GME from right where we are."
"24261950","24265030"," And there is no answer below here. "
"24265030","24267050"," I got to impress that upon you."
"24267070","24268290"," You're a GME bull, right?"
"24268990","24276890"," I don't fucking want to hear your voice if you break this fucking $13.50 and reject there."
"24277390","24278790"," I don't mean break it for a minute either. "
"24278970","24282010"," I mean, you break it and you begin to reject it."
"24282410","24285490"," If you do that, right, you have no voice from me."
"24285750","24287850"," I don't want to listen to you talk about buying a dip. "
"24288590","24289750"," It's really fucking bad."
"24290990","24293750"," This can't impress that upon you anymore."
"24293950","24294110"," Okay. "
"24294650","24300490"," So right where we are right now in GME is pretty much the place where you buy the fucking dip."
"24300650","24300850"," Okay."
"24301510","24305350"," This is your last chance is my point. "
"24305910","24307950"," What I'd really like to see here is this."
"24308330","24312830"," I'd really like to see this is one, two, and three."
"24313370","24315890"," I'd really like to see something like this, to be honest with you. "
"24319010","24320350"," Right up there below that."
"24320510","24321490"," Right up there below that."
"24321750","24323690"," I'd really like to see a squeeze up there. "
"24323830","24326630"," It's 22.96 and then come straight back down."
"24328390","24330450"," I'm explaining it better for you here in just a minute."
"24330550","24330690"," Okay. "
"24331530","24337530"," One, two, and three and then some consolidation."
"24338170","24340370"," And that's all I want right there."
"24341330","24342310"," That's all I want. "
"24343310","24344750"," Now, this could take a while."
"24345430","24348910"," You could be down here fucking digging around until you get underneath."
"24354100","24355680"," You could be down here for a while. "
"24355900","24356260"," You start."
"24356460","24357800"," Oh, let me get some of this stuff right here."
"24361670","24363130"," Here's the daily trigger right here. "
"24374120","24374460"," Right."
"24374640","24375880"," You want to see that break above."
"24380350","24382370"," You want to see this weekly trigger come underneath. "
"24385790","24387250"," And you really want to be seeing price."
"24387290","24391230"," You want to see you want to see constructive price here."
"24393130","24393530"," Right. "
"24393670","24395370"," It's good enough to get that squeeze right there."
"24396270","24397430"," Come back down here."
"24397550","24398210"," Start to consolidate. "
"24398930","24401190"," You get the half hour trigger."
"24401650","24402890"," We get the hourly underneath you."
"24402970","24405730"," You get the hourly trigger underneath you here. "
"24406530","24413390"," You get yourself a nice three trigger bull cluster on a weekly, a daily and an hourly basis."
"24414050","24416090"," And you rip some fucking faces off up here."
"24417570","24418690"," You know what I'm saying here?"
"24419130","24421750"," So this little thing's not, we're not here yet, are we?"
"24422530","24427370"," So I really want to see some constructive upside price on GME. "
"24428710","24429970"," Roughly about $16."
"24431030","24432010"," Right around $16."
"24432870","24436390"," If you come back to me and say, pick up at $16 and holding. "
"24437130","24441710"," I don't care if we're bouncing around in here like this, but if it's holding $16."
"24443310","24446430"," We'll start talking about attacking this $23."
"24448310","24448910"," Okay. "
"24448910","24457710"," And the other bigger to a bigger point, if you can get some of this monthly trigger down here and"
"24457710","24460290"," you can get that squeeze that I'm talking about here, right?"
"24461030","24462830"," Get that, that happening, right?"
"24463470","24466590"," You get up here, you're able to squeeze up and hold your pants up."
"24467410","24469670"," And then you're able to squeeze above that monthly trigger."
"24470110","24474370"," Even if we break back down and we need some time for the daily trigger to get up here. "
"24475250","24479770"," But that daily trigger and catch price, then get us above that $20."
"24480550","24484930"," We'll be in business for GME for bulls."
"24485970","24488590"," But there's a lot going on in here is my point. "
"24489250","24497630"," There's a lot of expected, in my view, expected volatility here for GME."
"24498770","24501370"," So if you're a bull, we'll go back to it again, right?"
"24501630","24502410"," I own GME."
"24502410","24503150"," What am I going to do, Cap?"
"24503470","24505470"," I'm going to put some crash puts on. "
"24505630","24505950"," They're worthless."
"24506590","24511830"," The first like penny or five cent puts you have for that time period, you throw those on."
"24512950","24515930"," And then you start getting fucking hungry for upside targets. "
"24517690","24520730"," You start saying I'm going to buy the dip here and protected to the downside."
"24522950","24526230"," I'm not going to get aggressive, but I'm going to start out building a position."
"24527150","24530570"," You get above the daily and the weekly. "
"24530570","24536530"," And if we're successful underneath prices successful on the weekly and daily, start getting more"
"24536530","24537970"," aggressive with buys."
"24538910","24540370"," Take this up here."
"24541310","24546570"," And then if we come up and we if we come up above the monthly trigger and you've got all"
"24546570","24553690"," these clusters underneath you, this momentum and you're turning momentum around on yourself, we"
"24553690","24555210"," could have a party on our hands. "
"24556110","24560090"," I mean a fucking party, but you get the six month."
"24560570","24562930"," You get the quarterly."
"24563450","24565910"," You get the weekly, the daily, the hourly. "
"24566810","24568750"," And you turn this on these sellers."
"24570130","24574830"," You could have another fucking major squeeze on your hands like you did back in 2020."
"24575790","24584290"," If I would never be caught dead short, dead short with price above those triggers. "
"24587130","24591530"," And with a consolidation back test in a new high, I would never be caught there."
"24592230","24596370"," And if you do get caught in that right there, I dare these hedge funds."
"24596590","24597890"," They will get fucked up. "
"24599010","24600810"," I mean serious fucked up."
"24601010","24601890"," They will get wrecked."
"24603030","24607230"," So you're either looking at a at a bankruptcy or you're looking at a major squeeze. "
"24608370","24610830"," Forming on GME."
"24613010","24615410"," You guys understand I'm coming at with this stuff."
"24618740","24620000"," I'm telling you. "
"24620840","24622620"," We're at a point here, right?"
"24622920","24627100"," Where you're we're triggering soon."
"24627680","24630060"," A pretty vicious downside move."
"24632820","24635980"," Or a pretty vicious upside move. "
"24636100","24637760"," I don't think there's any in between here."
"24638680","24640900"," I don't personally think there's any in between."
"24641600","24650120"," I think in between this level here, right here, in between this level, this is probably 20 bucks. "
"24651040","24654000"," In between here and here."
"24655120","24657560"," You're going to see some fucking violence if we go up there."
"24658300","24660760"," You might find a little bit of consolidation in this zone. "
"24661160","24664740"," But if we get up here, you're talking about a nice, sexy move."
"24664740","24669300"," And then you're just selling puts on all of this underlying that you bought."
"24669980","24670580"," Does that make sense?"
"24673140","24674620"," So there's a plan here. "
"24676200","24680100"," We start doing this turn here, right?"
"24680800","24683000"," This is just like a one minute chart on spoons, right?"
"24684120","24685100"," Do you see it in here?"
"24686300","24692240"," If you do this, then you start selling all the OTM puts, OTM puts, OTM puts on a huge underlying"
"24692240","24692780"," position."
"24696110","24699030"," Let me know your thoughts here on GME."
"24699230","24699890"," Do you think it's heading?"
"24700250","24701930"," Let me ask you a serious question in the chat. "
"24702150","24703250"," Do you think it's heading to bankruptcy?"
"24704370","24706830"," Because the signs right now are saying that it is."
"24711500","24713700"," I'm asking you guys some serious questions here."
"24713820","24713900"," Do you?"
"24714080","24714800"," Oh, a serious question. "
"24715220","24715960"," Tell me in the chat."
"24717640","24719680"," This is screaming bankruptcy."
"24725770","24729690"," The price action right now is screaming bankruptcy. "
"24729690","24730370"," D listing."
"24732530","24737810"," Not like a, not a two to under two dollars for a warning or anything like that."
"24737890","24739610"," It's screaming to me bankruptcy. "
"24740550","24748290"," So I don't know if that's true or not, but this is a place for you as a, you're like"
"24748290","24749430"," a long-term GME holder."
"24749910","24751710"," Start some protection, throw protection on."
"24756330","24757590"," I've heard that too, right?"
"24757750","24760650"," I've heard that same thing that they need to do this and they need to do that and they haven't,"
"24760710","24760870"," right?"
"24760870","24766150"," And they stopped, there was, they just stopped doing something else recently too, right?"
"24766330","24767990"," They were, do they stop doing NFTs or something?"
"24768810","24770250"," There's something that they stopped recently. "
"24773480","24775400"," Like this is bottom basically for you."
"24775460","24776440"," This is bottom for you."
"24777260","24778240"," This is your bottom. "
"24778400","24779720"," If you're a GME bull, this is your bottom."
"24780900","24781300"," 100%."
"24782540","24787120"," If this is not your bottom, I don't know what to say to you. "
"24788140","24789760"," The downside is ugly."
"24798630","24801110"," Now I'm wondering what your thesis is are here."
"24801570","24804050"," And I did see Roaring Kitty make some posts recently. "
"24805010","24810690"," I think Roaring Kitty even knows, I think even he knows that this is the place."
"24811590","24813390"," This is the last stand right here."
"24816120","24818400"," I saw Roar, I think I saw, yes, maybe that was it was. "
"24818540","24821560"," I got a text message or DM, I got a comment."
"24822720","24827800"," And then I responded to that person and I saw a tweet from Roaring Kitty and I think he knows"
"24827800","24828340"," that too."
"24829160","24833340"," This is your line in the sand for lack of a better answer. "
"24838290","24839650"," So I'm interested to know."
"24839970","24845530"," Now saying all of what I just said to you, you have to be very careful of the rejection."
"24845870","24848170"," This rejection, when they have one right here, you see that rejection?"
"24850190","24851370"," So how would this play out?"
"24851610","24852970"," Do I'm going to show you how it play out?"
"24853810","24855710"," I'll show you how it play out to the downside. "
"24860510","24861650"," You would lose this, right?"
"24862270","24864270"," You would hit your target down here."
"24866190","24874110"," But the scary part is that the scary part about this, how it plays out is your monthly would come"
"24874110","24874490"," down."
"24880850","24887380"," And you'd have a fucking bloodbath on your hands. "
"24888440","24892500"," And that's where the death nail comes right down there."
"24892500","24895280"," And you get that."
"24895520","24897080"," Dude, I rarely see this. "
"24897900","24902400"," I only see these things on tickers that are going to zero."
"24913320","24915340"," Let me see if anyone's commenting in YouTube here."
"24918940","24919440"," Thanks Adrian. "
"24923570","24926350"," I see a squeeze even in the downside move."
"24926750","24927750"," So what we'll do is this."
"24928850","24934570"," I'm going to reach out to James Rowland and see what his take is on this. "
"24936470","24938550"," Because I know James watches it very close."
"24938550","24945050"," They'll ask him on public if he'll come on the show and find out what he thinks."
"24947170","24949790"," Because we start giving this up. "
"24952310","24954150"," And you're talking about really fast moving."
"24954730","24959550"," There's some consolidation zones, but there's some really big moves in there along the way."
"24960410","24963290"," And I don't want to be sitting here, like with your saying in March, right?"
"24963290","24966490"," I don't want to be sitting here in March or June or September. "
"24968870","24971030"," And we're talking about bankruptcy."
"24982030","24983210"," What are you guys saying here?"
"24983490","24987290"," The good, no debt extreme cost cutting in tons of cash on hand."
"24989610","24992510"," Agreed with that though that he can invest in his discretion. "
"24992790","24995750"," I have no all those points already, but we've known that for how long now."
"24996550","24997650"," How long have we known that?"
"24998230","24999210"," Long time, right?"
"25001070","25003330"," The bad, there's still no short, long term strategy."
"25003710","25004550"," I agree with that one too. "
"25004630","25006470"," He's had some time to do that too, hasn't he?"
"25014610","25016470"," They need to do something to generate more money."
"25016770","25017070"," I agree."
"25017330","25018550"," And I think time is running out. "
"25018710","25021710"," There's another problem here, but there could be a takeover."
"25023310","25025610"," There could be a board takeover."
"25026210","25027170"," They want to buy it cheaper. "
"25028090","25032950"," If they're going to fall through with that investment, maybe that's what it is."
"25033490","25041430"," They want price at $0.60 at $0.08. That's possible for an M&A or some kind."
"25046020","25047220"," That's a good .2, Sam. "
"25047400","25049740"," They need to buy a Unity or a company like that to transition to mobile gaming."
"25054420","25060320"," Yeah, if you want that reverse, you know, if our C has that, I know he's got that grand vision."
"25060320","25061360"," He's got a bunch of cash on hand. "
"25061500","25066880"," Maybe it's a matter of getting the price low enough they can take it private to execute that."
"25066880","25069540"," That plan has not materialized, right?"
"25077090","25077590"," Okay."
"25078610","25079250"," All right. "
"25079530","25083750"," AMC said we do AMC."
"25084090","25084850"," We're going to do it right now."
"25090750","25092250"," Now I want to show you AMC. "
"25097430","25098470"," You see that right there?"
"25100810","25102590"," What did I say in stream?"
"25102590","25111030"," I said trade is dead below 8.12, right?"
"25112070","25116470"," I'm trend break of HT, right?"
"25118290","25119490"," That happened."
"25120730","25122470"," And where is that now?"
"25123670","25126190"," It's in full capitulation mode."
"25127350","25128830"," What is it trading right now?"
"25129780","25134470"," $4.43. This is where GME is. "
"25135430","25137850"," Is the last time I talked about AMC."
"25139930","25140790"," You fuck this up."
"25142610","25144330"," And it's blood. "
"25144910","25146050"," Straight fucking down."
"25147570","25149310"," And that's what's happened, right?"
"25149550","25156930"," It's lost 100% of its value or 50% went from $8 to $4 fucking dollars."
"25158190","25160330"," And do you know where the next target is?"
"25160890","25166440"," 0.0004 cents. "
"25169300","25170460"," Not good, is it?"
"25172440","25178800"," If you're tracking me now, I think this, I think that, I think this, I think that."
"25179840","25181000"," And what's happening?"
"25181180","25182420"," You're just hanging out down here."
"25184540","25185780"," See what I'm getting at here?"
"25185780","25190560"," And you're coming into another test here in AMC right now. "
"25191860","25192900"," This is good."
"25194680","25197820"," And I'm going to show you the AMC trade next."
"25203560","25206640"," Your next check is coming up right now, right?"
"25206960","25207120"," See it?"
"25225500","25227220"," Kind of a wonky-ass looking line. "
"25228240","25228900"," I'm not going to lie."
"25231260","25232180"," So, hun."
"25234540","25238360"," One, two, three, four days from now. "
"25240220","25241760"," Four days from now."
"25243220","25248220"," One of the good things for you is you're above the hourly trigger."
"25249000","25254720"," You have a three-trigger bull cluster and you have a cross of the half-hour trigger coming above. "
"25254720","25259490"," So, right here."
"25269730","25270770"," Expectations."
"25304420","25312380"," GME expectations are to see the AMC by the 24th of January. "
"25313120","25323100"," Price target, $5.26. I think you break above that $5.26. I'm going to give"
"25323100","25334970"," a target of $5.50. You must stay on trend if you"
"25334970","25336690"," at any point break trend."
"25337490","25339170"," Do you know what the next target is?"
"25357430","25366630"," $2.50. If at any point trend breaks,"
"25367210","25377210"," you start doing this goofy shit down here."
"25377910","25379870"," You're going to bounce. "
"25384990","25386790"," So, right?"
"25387150","25387490"," Oh, wait a minute."
"25400330","25403010"," Break back up and right back down here."
"25403970","25404850"," Something like that. "
"25406710","25417510"," So, if you're an AMC, current price target, $4.58, come back down, retest $4.30. Next"
"25417510","25427230"," target, $4.78, $4.48, $4.92, $4.70, $4.07, and then blast up here to $5.49."
"25435630","25436750"," Do or die here?"
"25445050","25451150"," After $2.50, you'll end up, well, you target $5, or no, $5.50. Then you go to $1.00,"
"25451470","25455710"," then you're going to go to $0.60, then you're going to go to $0.30, and then you're going"
"25455710","25456050"," to go to $0."
"25461020","25463940"," And we already know the CEO owns it right down here."
"25464200","25465760"," This is where the CEO owns it down here. "
"25469450","25471890"," I think it's $1.60 or $2.00 somewhere in there."
"25472190","25472990"," Correct me if I'm wrong."
"25473710","25475390"," That's where this asshole is right down there. "
"25484700","25488180"," There's your $2.00. There's your $1.60 right there."
"25490860","25494660"," Let me know in the chat what you think about AMC."
"25496580","25498680"," Do you want to take a snapshot of that?"
"25499500","25507180"," This here, if you break here down, break here down, break here down, break up here, down. "
"25508960","25510260"," Down, down, down, down."
"25510820","25511960"," You have to stay on trend."
"25515970","25520790"," We'll talk above $5.27. We'll have a chat. "
"25520790","25530420"," If you can get above this, $5, if you can at any point"
"25530420","25538200"," establish a foothold above $5.30, you will trade"
"25538200","25543800"," 15 bucks up here."
"25546020","25548360"," You get above here?"
"25548360","25549080"," Ooh, moon shot."
"25551600","25560700"," Get above $5.30. You'll trade 14 then it'll be that 13 mark, 13 bucks or so. "
"25563520","25565800"," You must get above this right here."
"25569320","25575420"," You need to stem the tide of selling and start doing this shit right here."
"25577060","25582580"," Tax, consolidate, tax, consolidate, attack, consolidate. "
"25583480","25586760"," That's into the end of the year for AMC."
"25587600","25588980"," Price target end of the year, 15 bucks."
"25592180","25594220"," We're, yeah, no, hold on a second, 15. "
"25594420","25595300"," No, it'll go higher than 15."
"25596040","25602220"," It'll probably go $35 PT end of the year."
"25607510","25611030"," Can not lose this trend here or it's going to be a fucking bloodbath. "
"25612530","25614230"," It'll be a fucking penny stock again."
"25622350","25624030"," I think AMC is done."
"25625430","25627470"," I'll be honest, I think AMC is done. "
"25630730","25633390"," No, there's a nut done."
"25634010","25638190"," AMC can survive down at two bucks for fair value."
"25638670","25641230"," It's not fair value, but that's where the owner owns it. "
"25641230","25649430"," So I could become a sub $10 trader for a long time for months, years."
"25651870","25654410"," You know, I know that because then you're looking at."
"25662190","25663430"," See this right here?"
"25666590","25668270"," This is months right here. "
"25672310","25673470"," That's 2026."
"25678380","25679960"," 2026, 2030, 2040."
"25680460","25684300"," If you're even going to do that, just be really careful on this ticker. "
"25686320","25687320"," Super hella careful."
"25689300","25691320"," And I don't care about all that stuff back there."
"25692180","25694560"," Because it goes to fucking zero if you keep going any lower. "
"25701750","25703250"," It's got to be wild, the dilution."
"25706030","25708150"," I got to be straight with the on both of these."
"25709930","25712790"," AMC looks more like doesn't look like bankruptcy. "
"25713310","25715070"," AMC more or less looks like."
"25715490","25716670"," Take it back to the dot."
"25716910","25717930"," Do you remember something too?"
"25718130","25719950"," I got to say something else here. "
"25721850","25725930"," GME, there was a mechanical reason why it should squeeze forever."
"25726730","25729370"," It was very similar to Volkswagen."
"25731170","25732990"," When Volkswagen did that shit. "
"25733210","25735170"," I think it was 1987 when Volkswagen did that."
"25735170","25737870"," There really wasn't a reason for AMC to squeeze though."
"25738310","25743590"," AMC for a long time was very low, very low, you know. "
"25745030","25745930"," We're not low."
"25746190","25747330"," We should look back over here, right?"
"25747870","25751310"," It started out up here at $111, right?"
"25752250","25753610"," Went lower and lower and lower."
"25755910","25760870"," And the CEO claimed that he was in for like two bucks or something. "
"25761050","25762970"," So that must have been pre IPO."
"25763710","25764250"," You got what I'm saying?"
"25764250","25767890"," So there are people out there that actually own this company at a very low price."
"25768670","25771070"," Pre IPO, or pre IPO, I'm assuming here. "
"25772110","25777070"," And like, you know, when you have IPO company and it's like IPO and 50 bucks."
"25777850","25782210"," Trades immediately down to six bucks, five bucks, whatever that is."
"25783250","25788810"," I wouldn't be surprised to see that trade down to where all those original owners own it. "
"25789390","25793490"," And then it trades back up again, like two bucks to $10 somewhere in there."
"25793490","25795570"," $10 to $20, that kind of stuff."
"25798390","25799270"," I think they're better. "
"25799490","25801190"," I agree with you that their fundamentals are better."
"25801390","25803470"," AMC's fundamentals are better."
"25803750","25805190"," But what else is wrong with AMC?"
"25805650","25808810"," They own a bunch of shit that people don't see anymore, right?"
"25809450","25810810"," There's like a there's like a destruction. "
"25811750","25819470"," Whether you know this or not or agree to this or not, there is a fundamental change in how we"
"25819470","25822430"," consume entertainment in this country."
"25823950","25830590"," Gone are the days of movies being the center of entertainment for a family in this country."
"25831850","25832930"," In a movie theater. "
"25834250","25836930"," No one, none of these kids have any attention span."
"25837650","25842090"," These kids, matter of fact, you go to, if you go to Twitter, Twitch, not Twitter, Twitch, YouTube,"
"25843130","25843210"," anywhere."

"25883690","25887110"," How do they, they're almost in the bone of GME to some extent."
"25887310","25888950"," They're not there yet, but they're almost there."
"25889630","25891330"," A lot of Hollywood is there too, right?"

"25915340","25915900"," entertainment."
"25916940","25918480"," So it's not that AMC can't survive. "
"25918860","25925480"," It's that it's either an MMA or it's going to have to adjust to that new environment."
"25926680","25929700"," And I really don't think the tentpole thing is going to fly."
"25931160","25937300"," I think it's like the tentpole movies they're making for the entire world to consume. "
"25938320","25941800"," They're going to fly, but they're not going to fly like we expect them to fly."

"25988390","25991690"," I apologize for being so sour and dour on these two tickers. "
"25992850","25994330"," But GME's got to do something."

"26001030","26001110"," AMC. "
"26002430","26007270"," I likely see it going back, not back to pre-pandemic levels because it never was that low."
"26007270","26011810"," I expect it to be priced in for where the principal owners are."
"26012070","26012450"," That's $2. "
"26013330","26014450"," Roughly right around $2."
"26015270","26016750"," And that will be its zone trading."
"26017630","26018630"," Two to $10 to $20. "
"26019130","26020830"," It'll be the new life for that ticker."
"26022090","26023910"," GME looking like bankruptcy."
"26024910","26027330"," I have even worse outlook on GME right now. "
"26028190","26034630"," Or some kind of takeover by the board to execute a plan that they've been talking about forever."
"26035930","26036730"," Something there."
"26037350","26038650"," Now I hope that there's a turnaround. "
"26039590","26042550"," But I got to see it before you believe it."
"26043490","26047550"," You need to see price regain these things to get bullish to get in these tickers."
