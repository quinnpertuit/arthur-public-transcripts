"nSkgrWVD1dU","7000","9000"," Check 1-2."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","12000","14000"," Check 1-2."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","21000","23000"," Go on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","30000","35000"," Check 1-2."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","35000","37000"," Check 1-2. We live. I don't know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","37000","39000"," We live this morning, you guys see me?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","39000","42000"," We're having some issues all week."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","55000","56000"," Think God is Friday, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","56000","58000"," Good boy, hey, hey, what's going on?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","58000","61000"," I can't see you, but, Harry, thank you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","61000","83000"," MUSIC"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","85000","88000"," What up, Johnny Moogs? What's going on out there?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","89000","92000"," Where's John Dickus?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","96000","99000"," If you're out there, John Dickus, good morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","105000","107000"," How's everybody doing out there? I can see you now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","107000","109000"," I got y'all out there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","110000","112000"," We're gonna get this show rolling here in just a moment."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","112000","114000"," Look at him trying to doom us up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","115000","121000"," This is actually a good sign before the open, uh, section of, uh, yeah, we're gonna go clearing this all out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","121000","123000"," This actually looks pretty good."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","124000","126000"," I know you guys are probably panicking right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","129000","131000"," Go beat panic. It's Friday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","135000","137000"," Mirror is always bearish."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","138000","140000"," That's why we're good friends."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","140000","143000"," He works well as a salary, I work well as a buyer, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","143000","150000"," A buyer out there, but, uh, so this morning, uh, we'll go over to the, we'll go over to the trigger screen really quick before we get into the market brief."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","150000","153000"," Let's see if we can get over there really quick."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","154000","160000"," So this morning, uh, we'll go over to the, we'll go over to the trigger screen really quick before we get into the market brief."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","160000","163000"," Let's see if we can get over there really quick."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","163000","166000"," So this actually isn't too bad right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","166000","171000"," I actually don't mind this. So we're in pre-market right now, right? It's 923 in the morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","171000","175000"," And, uh, so this is the close yesterday, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","175000","177000"," This whole part right here is the close."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","177000","180000"," I always hate these squeezes into the bell, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","180000","181000"," Because what do they like to do?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","181000","183000"," They like to, they like to get into the cash market."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","183000","187000"," And you think you're going up and they come right back down and knock out that what?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","187000","188000"," That pivot."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","188000","191000"," So they're doing this in pre-market right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","191000","194000"," So I'm not necessarily bearish here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","194000","198000"," Um, someone asked them the, on the discordor for buying, uh, calls or anything, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","198000","200000"," We're like, no, you got to be above, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","200000","203000"," It's going to be price one minute, five minute hourly."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","203000","209000"," And all this doom right here, I'm not actually, I actually prefer to see these pivots taken out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","209000","213000"," Uh, early in the morning before we even get to the open."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","213000","215000"," Uh, and the reason, what's the reason for that?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","215000","219000"," Uh, because I really want to go up there and touch some of these higher up pivots, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","219000","222000"," I want to get way up there and start, start messing around."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","222000","224000"," So don't be too concerned at this moment."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","224000","228000"," I guess you could be, but I wouldn't be buying puts here on the opening bell."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","228000","231000"," I'd actually be looking for a rip off the opening bell this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","231000","235000"," So you got six minutes left. Uh, yeah, this isn't going to hold for this thing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","235000","237000"," This isn't going to fly for me, at least."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","237000","242000"," Uh, but we'll see what happens if we start selling right off the bell this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","242000","244000"," Uh, we'll follow it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","244000","248000"," The one thing that I'm going to say to you though, is that if we do start selling off the bell, uh,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","248000","253000"," that I would never trust that like this is the bell right here that we're going to start going like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","253000","257000"," Um, I always want to see like this is not cash market."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","257000","261000"," Because it's all fake market, fake, fake market."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","261000","263000"," Okay, always remember that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","263000","266000"," Um, this is all fake market. So it's very dangerous."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","266000","269000"," It's not that you can't keep selling off the opening bell."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","269000","274000"," It's that it's a fake ass market before you get to nine o'clock or nine 30 in the morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","274000","277000"," And oftentimes enough of the time."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","277000","281000"," Not every time, but enough of the time you're going to be a loser."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","281000","285000"," Um, in cash market with these kind of moves. It's very similar to,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","285000","290000"," uh, if you see a gap up, right? You see a gap, but we gap up and you, we open the opening bell."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","290000","292000"," You guys know what I do, right? You guys have known for years, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","292000","294000"," If we gap up overnight, what do I say?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","294000","297000"," Now you take the money and you might get a little more gap on the opening bell,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","297000","301000"," maybe a little bit. So you might get a little gap here on the opening bell,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","301000","304000"," but most of that shit gets erased."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","304000","308000"," You rarely don't come back to, um, clear all that shit up,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","308000","310000"," but I don't mean leaving gaps behind."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","310000","313000"," I'm talking about stuff like this specifically."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","313000","316000"," Um, so just be careful here. We've got a nine 25."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","316000","318000"," You're a bear here, anything like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","318000","320000"," Uh, just be careful here with all the doom and gloom."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","320000","323000"," You're likely going to see a squeeze up my take right here. You ask me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","323000","326000"," You're going to come right back up here on the opening bell this morning. Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","326000","330000"," And, uh, clear out, clear all this nonsense out. This is somebody."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","330000","335000"," This is like one person selling one fucking contract, uh, right before the open here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","335000","337000"," This is not like a bloodletting or anything."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","337000","341000"," We'll talk about it to you some more. Uh, if you, hopefully, if you have not,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","341000","343000"," I'm going to say this to you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","343000","347000"," If you have not, uh, this morning at this point,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","347000","352000"," read the market brief for today, but I mean all of it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","352000","355000"," Don't be like, I didn't read it. Cap. You didn't do it. Cap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","355000","358000"," I only watched the show. I only follow you on Twitter."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","358000","362000"," You got to read that. Those market briefs, uh, those two things."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","362000","364000"," You got to read the market. If you're going to be a part of this community,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","364000","366000"," you got to read the market briefs at minimum."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","366000","370000"," You don't have to read all the pro stuff. I think that you should because I think it's even better,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","370000","376000"," but you got to read the market briefs because it shows you where I'm at after the close into the morning open."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","377000","384000"," If anything changes, especially if the market brief, let's say I read a market brief and I'm like, yeah, we're going to be up 100 points tomorrow."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","384000","389000"," And we're down 200 points. You got to check those market briefs because we have to adjust."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","389000","395000"," Uh, to that, to those things, those eventualities, right? Those eventualities always happen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","395000","399000"," So you got to follow along and I got to make this clear."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","399000","404000"," If you want to ever know my thesis on things or where I'm at."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","405000","412000"," Market brief is from, uh, after the close or until market open."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","412000","419000"," Uh, the rest of my thesis is on stream. When I'm here on stream with you, you get the rest of my market thesis."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","419000","426000"," And then at the end of the day, I always spend at least five minutes, sometimes longer, but I spend five minutes with you on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","426000","431000"," What do I think is going to happen into tomorrow? Not the shit posting on Twitter."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","431000","439000"," Not the, uh, I don't know. You find me somewhere talking on a phone call or shooting the shit with somebody or anything like that. You guys know where I stand at least."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","439000","447000"," Um, and the last part that has to do with that is, um, you should always know something about me crystal clear."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","447000","453000"," Uh, you will meet trolls out there, not that that's happened or anything, but you will meet trolls out there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","453000","458000"," Uh, that'll attack people and say, you said this or you said that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","459000","464000"," And there ain't no way that I will ever be a mentor to you ever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","464000","473000"," And say to you, uh, you make yourself a thesis and you follow it through to the end because if you do, you're going to blow yourself up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","473000","483000"," Uh, one of the key lessons is to, uh, be able to adjust to the reality and market that's in front of you. So, uh, be clear on that for yourself too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","483000","489000"," Don't ever fall into those traps on social media where you see trolls out there where they're good or bad."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","489000","495000"," You can see someone that's always like, uh, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, right? Or, hey, you were wrong there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","495000","500000"," It's always going up or whatever. You can see it on the flip side too, right? You said this was going up and it's not."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","500000","506000"," So it doesn't matter if it's like a bull or bear troll, but stay away from that shit because it's cancer."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","506000","516000"," When you consume that shit all day long, it begins to impact your decision making ability and your flexibility as an investor and as a trader."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","516000","525000"," Um, and I've done that. When I was younger, I would consume that stuff, right? Because it can make you feel good, right? That negativity."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","525000","532000"," Uh, it's easy to fall into that trap. Um, especially, you know, a great way to describe this is going to be."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","532000","543000"," Uh, you know, you like get hurt in life or kid or something when your child. You will, um, someone will slight you or someone will say something that you don't like."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","543000","556000"," And, uh, or anything that's against your, um, something for you that you either hurt over or hurt. Like somebody says, Hey, Captain Jim James, where's glasses."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","557000","570000"," And, uh, and let's say I'm sensitive on that topic. And I get hurt. And so then, uh, two other people start making fun of that person that, um, made fun of me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","570000","577000"," It's very easy to go. Well, I'm going to go with those two people over there and we're going to make fun of that person that made fun of me, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","578000","585000"," Um, but that's poison in life. It's poison and trading. Uh, and especially with your money that's important to you. So just be careful on that. Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","585000","591000"," Um, be careful on that whole like thing that you find out there in social media. So, all right, here we go."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","591000","595000"," Come on, I gotta get this door open. It's really hot."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","595000","601000"," Now it's nine thirty, right? You see the bloodletting that's coming down and watch. Let's see what happens here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","601000","607000"," This is the nine thirty bell and you're going to see that this gets bought right up. You should be should get bought right up. I don't think that it's going down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","607000","613000"," And let's take a look at the, uh, let's put the pivots up for you and we're going to do a quick market brief. Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","615000","617000"," Where are they at right there?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","617000","622000"," So this is S one right here, right? Just below the, uh, the pivot point for the day."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","622000","629000"," Uh, you want to see if we do get any kind of rejection above. If you are, are a trainer."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","629000","635000"," You want to look for two things. If you're a bear, you're looking for a rejection right here, though. I don't think you're going to get it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","635000","644000"," I would be looking for rejection above. So if you're a seller, this is the place right here in cash market to be selling above at five thirteen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","644000","647000"," Five thirteen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","647000","650000"," It's a nice open by the way."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","650000","658000"," You can watch that go up anyway. So price target upside price target right now is going. I'm going to put this on here for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","659000","664000"," Upside price target right there. Five thirteen thirty six."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","664000","673000"," And I make sure you read that market brief. If you hadn't read it in the overnight, I did write it out and some of this is playing out that's in that market brief right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","673000","679000"," So go out, go on there and read that market brief. I'll leave that to the side there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","682000","685000"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","686000","694000"," All right, I'll be right. Not right back, but I'm going to switch over right now to the market brief."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","694000","699000"," I love this too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","699000","703000"," Dude, I don't know if we I don't know if we watch CNBC."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","703000","709000"," I don't know if we I don't know if we keep CNBC on just to make fun of it, but I really like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","709000","715000"," I really like so we're an op-ex right we're an op-ex and this is what they run with."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","715000","718000"," Markets in turmoil."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","718000","726000"," S and P opens lower on inflation concerns pause and then be in video rally."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","726000","735000"," I don't even know if you call it a rally, right? The fucking shit's been fucking straight fucking bar and up for like two years."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","735000","742000"," Peter podcast had a great point out it yesterday. He was like, he's like, dude, I've been in fucking NBA for like fucking two years."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","742000","745000"," He's like, I don't know what these people are talking about."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","745000","754000"," So I did find this funny this morning. You got a big red red red red thing above here and says doom and gloom on op-ex of all days."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","754000","757000"," Okay, he didn't run with op-ex, huh?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","757000","772000"," You ran with you ran with doom and gloom. I couldn't even imagine being an intern at CNBC because they only have like they probably have like a file folder system with like three packages."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","772000","778000"," What is it today, boss? We're going with doom today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","778000","783000"," Okay, so we've got here Friday's biggest animals calls. We're not going to get into that this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","783000","794000"," This is by the way, CNBC pro. Goldman is making a big call to clients to hedge for a market decline. Here's what it recommends."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","794000","800000"," So this is news from this morning and it's making the front page of CNBC."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","800000","808000"," This was inside of your brief, though, last night. I didn't get it from here, but I want you to be aware of it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","808000","811000"," And if you don't know what this is right here, this headline."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","811000","821000"," Goldman, this is an important headline here. Goldman is not saying to you that there's going to be a market decline in any way, shape, or form."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","821000","828000"," Though this headline reads like that, right? This headline kind of portrays to you that a decline is coming."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","828000","835000"," And that's not so much the guaranteed case. More that's coming down the road."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","835000","843000"," There's an opportunity for decline. I can't say that there isn't going to be a decline, but I can't also say there isn't going to be a run higher."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","843000","850000"," What is expected, though, from this statement right here is a bumpy road ahead."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","850000","853000"," So what is a bumpy road, I guess, would be the question."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","853000","858000"," So just here, I can make it very simple for you. It's very simple."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","858000","861000"," So if we have, let me do it a different way."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","861000","868000"," So if we have, we know the markets go up, right? We can posit that, right? The markets go up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","868000","875000"," And we can also posit that there's no, I mean, I guess, no, I know some of you guys understand this, but a lot of you don't, right? I shouldn't draw it like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","876000","883000"," So normally the markets, when they're stable, they actually don't go up in a vertical."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","883000","887000"," They kind of go up slowly."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","887000","896000"," And there's a nice rhythm to it, right? Just like this, right? Well, supposedly, theoretically."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","896000","903000"," So when you have a market that has no volatility and then we're coming into next week with volatility expected, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","903000","908000"," And even the vol surface is becoming more volatile as we head into today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","908000","913000"," Into our into today, it begins to increase. And then by Monday, it really starts to ramp."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","913000","918000"," It doesn't come down until Friday. If you don't know that, that's in the market brief, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","918000","928000"," So what is a, what's, what's, so we have, we have three phases, right? We've got low volatility, bull market, right? Positive gamma."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","928000","936000"," Then we have volatility. And then we have sell the rip bear market. I don't know, negative gamma, all that stuff, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","936000","941000"," So we got like three different, three different really zones, almost like a, this isn't neutral either on gamma."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","941000","946000"," That does another one, I guess, would be neutral gamma, but we can have volatility expected volatility."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","946000","952000"," It doesn't necessarily imply down, but it does imply some violent moves, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","952000","956000"," You could be, you could be tooling right along up here, like do, do, do, do, we're just heading up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","956000","961000"," Everything is cool. No expect, we are expecting, let me do it this way."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","961000","972000"," Hey, I'm expecting like, expecting this to be bought and then boom, right? Straight down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","972000","979000"," But then it comes straight back up again, right? You could be up here, you could be up here going, yeah, we're going to roll down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","979000","986000"," And then boom, straight up. You understand what I'm saying with this? So you have this no volatility."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","986000","993000"," We're not negative gamma, but we do have these moves that are outsized and out of expected range."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","993000","1000000"," And that is the key point here. So you could be the bear trying to sell this and you get your face ripped off."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1000000","1004000"," You could be the bull trying to buy this and you get your face ripped off."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1004000","1010000"," It's a very simple way to explain what's expected next week is just this little crayon chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1010000","1015000"," Fairly simple, right? Doesn't mean we're going up, doesn't mean we're going down. We could go down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1015000","1025000"," We could even staircase this down with volatility next week, but it's not necessarily, it's not necessarily, though, that we're heading down, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1025000","1032000"," It's not like trend is down. We could even staircase this down, but it's still not trend being down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1032000","1040000"," It's like these drops. I try to relate it to, I try to relate it to, um, I try to relate it to like an air."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1040000","1045000"," If you've ever been in an airplane with turbulence, you'll be flying at 20,000 feet. They'll be asked my Ferris pressure."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1045000","1051000"," Let's say of, I don't know, I don't fucking 10 parts out of 100 and then all of a sudden it becomes eight parts out of 100."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1051000","1055000"," That goes back 10 parts out of 100 and eight parts, 10 parts and you're just bouncing, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1055000","1061000"," You ever feel that when you're on a, I don't know if you're ever taking a flight for in turbulence, but everything is smooth."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1061000","1065000"," And then boom, drop. And you come back up, everything is smooth, boom, drop."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1065000","1074000"," Same thing happens when you're in a boat, right? If you're in rough weather, if you've ever sailed or had a motorboat and you've encountered a squall, things can get wild."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1074000","1079000"," You're just going along, everything is up, down, up, down, right? Then all of a sudden boom, your boat drops."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1079000","1085000"," Um, it's very scary. Um, so anyways, that's that. Okay. So you have that inside your market brief."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1086000","1092000"," UBS reveals the most and least preferred some semi conductor names, giving one 70% upside."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1092000","1095000"," I started to read that yesterday and I was like, I don't know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1095000","1103000"," I was like, I don't know. Look beyond envy. They're all like, every time I read this shit here, right? From CNBC, stuff like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1103000","1110000"," Reminds me of dumping every time. Every time, like, Hey man, take your money out of Nvidia and go over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1110000","1116000"," Or anything, anything, take your money out of RK because rolling over, put it in ArcG."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1116000","1122000"," Uh, then they sell that on you too. So just be wary of any kind of headlines like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1122000","1126000"," It's, it's like, it's like two or three companies and that's it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1126000","1130000"," Two on spec, you know, this, this is a lesson for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1130000","1135000"," They're like three companies doing real AI. The rest of them."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1135000","1139000"," Like, like literally lying to you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1139000","1144000"," There's only a couple companies, two or three companies out there that actually have the ability."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1144000","1152000"," To make the jumps and leaps that these other companies are doing. This is like an exclusive thing. You might not want to believe that, but it really is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1152000","1160000"," You need money and you need scientists and you need tons of computing and manufacturing power."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1160000","1169000"," So I mean, I realized there's a way to run with this. I realized that there's a guy out there or girl out there with like a three person team that's like, we're going to be the next biggest thing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1169000","1173000"," The truth is specifically this industry."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1173000","1180000"," You want to be with who's got the power, the money and the infrastructure for that growth."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1180000","1181000"," Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1181000","1183000"," Right off our CNBC this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1183000","1186000"," Next thing is going to be financial juice."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1186000","1195000"," We've got on the opening bell this morning. We've got MMS MMO imbalance 2.4 billion to the south side. We've got industrial US industrial production year over year."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1195000","1200000"," Minus 2.3%. No, don't forget we got Michigan sentiment at 10 a.m. this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1200000","1203000"," Another 20 minutes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1203000","1211000"," We've got US industrial production month over month. Actual point one percent forecast zero percent."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1211000","1219000"," Previous point one percent revised point five percent US manufacturing output month over month point eight percent."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1219000","1222000"," The forecast was what?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1222000","1225000"," Forecast is point three percent, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1225000","1231000"," Take the fund rate of five point three three percent and was one of the thing that we're talking about the effective fund, effective funds rate."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1231000","1234000"," The future funds rate right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1234000","1238000"," After yesterday's data blasted down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1238000","1248000"," So in the idea here is that the idea here is that the idea here is that the future funds rate is gambling."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1248000","1253000"," Okay, it's it's not real at all. There's nothing real about it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1253000","1258000"," And people use it and quote it and say, especially when they stand on it, they're like, this is going to happen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1258000","1265000"," It's it's not ever going to happen. It fluctuates up and down and it likes to go to extremes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1265000","1269000"," And it's for making money, not for predicting."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1269000","1273000"," I guess it's for people use it predicting, but it's not really there for that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1273000","1280000"," And yesterday they're basically trying to price in only two rate cuts this year, not three."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1280000","1283000"," Like was it was was the thought process."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1283000","1290000"," So you have to ask yourself, you have to look forward and ask yourself, why is that being priced in?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1290000","1295000"," And why are people saying that? And we discussed this already earlier in the week."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1295000","1303000"," I don't know if you remember this. We looked on Monday, I believe, at the all the all the macro that you need."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1303000","1309000"," And we I told you we have we have the hand over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1309000","1318000"," I was like, I was like Jerome Powell wants inflation and unemployment to go like this up a little bit down a little bit down a little bit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1319000","1324000"," Right. And I said to her this week, I was like, look, it's so simple."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1324000","1330000"," You don't need to complicate this stuff. They've sent unemployment up, right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1330000","1333000"," And literally last week."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1333000","1337000"," So stupid, like, then they had like inflation down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1337000","1342000"," So we were like, why do you, what do you think's going to happen with inflation? And I said, Oh, it's going to be up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1343000","1348000"," They're going to report inflation up this week. It's that fucking stupid."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1348000","1354000"," The fraud that's created right now in the economic data is comical."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1354000","1359000"," It's like one report slightly up, one report slightly down, one report slightly up, one report slightly down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1359000","1365000"," And this week in particular, we were due for an up report inflation and we got it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1365000","1374000"," And now we've got both up at the same time. And guess what happens when we get those two up moves, those slight, not velocity, just slight."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1374000","1379000"," We get what? They said it earlier Monday. We get some down, right? That usually follows that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1379000","1388000"," But is it crash or burn? Is it not three rate hikes this year? No, no, no, not at all."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1388000","1392000"," And you're going to likely see the next two reports come out and guess what they're going to show."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1392000","1399000"," Take a guess. The unemployment rate is going to come down slightly and inflation is going to come down slightly."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1399000","1406000"," Now, if that doesn't happen, we see more velocity will be scared of it, but it's not it hasn't been doing that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1406000","1421000"," So you have to kind of stick with what's been happening. We have many examples of this in the past where the fed will manipulate when we get down here to try to slow the velocity of unemployment, the velocity of jobs,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1421000","1428000"," and the velocity of inflation. So in their view, as long as they do that, the markets are safe."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1428000","1441000"," If you begin to see inflation slam down and bounce off 2%, if you begin to see ramping in unemployment, if you begin to see jobs available slamming down, there is cause for concern there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1441000","1447000"," But that is not what's happening right now. It's not what happened last week or the month before or whatever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1447000","1454000"," There's a true manipulation going on in the market right now by the fed in the treasury department until they lose control of it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1454000","1460000"," So when you're seeing statements out there by people saying, hey, look, we're only now pricing in two rate hikes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1460000","1467000"," It makes me think of, okay, let's get to an extreme then. Let's slam down small caps as deep as we can get it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1467000","1473000"," Why though? Not because there's fair of that actually happening. So we can get a better price. Does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1473000","1484000"," So these are people that accumulate and distribute all day on every timeframe over a year, over six months, over three months, over a month, over a week, over a day, over five minutes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1484000","1489000"," So think about that instead of what doesn't mean anything."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1489000","1494000"," And I really do want you to know that like it's accumulation and distribution."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1494000","1501000"," It has not all the rest of its bullshit. And even when something is real, that the market really doesn't know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1501000","1504000"," You never see hold or at least price hold."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1504000","1518000"," It's like if the market really doesn't know something happens, I don't want to say these things, but if there's like an unintended unknown, you know, I don't want to say like a terrorist attack or something like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1518000","1523000"," You'll oftentimes see the market blast down on some really unknown news and then come straight back up again."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1523000","1529000"," You'll even see good news. That's truly unknown. You'll see a blast straight up and it won't hold."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1529000","1537000"," If the banks know it's coming, it'll blast up and hold. If the blast down on news and the banks already knew about it, it'll hold down there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1537000","1543000"," But usually you'll see the retracement almost automatically so that they can position properly for it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1543000","1548000"," You understand what I'm saying here? That's the manipulation that goes on in our marketplace."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1548000","1553000"," U.S. export prices month over month actual point eight percent."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1553000","1566000"," Excuse me. New York Fed manufacturing actual point minus twenty point nine month over my actual point three percent Goldman Sachs CEO Solomon CEOs tell me, let me start back down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1566000","1573000"," Think tight here. Solomon saying 2023 was a year of execution. I'm optimistic about 2024."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1573000","1583000"," The U.S. economy is more resilient than expected inflation may prove stickier than many anticipate the Fed has room to ease if conditions decline."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1583000","1589000"," And that is another topic of conversation. This part right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1589000","1607000"," And this is where I agree with trader podcast. I'm not on the month over month inflation, but we are starting to come into that part of rate hikes where you are going to start to look at taking a little bit of gas off, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1607000","1622000"," No more no breaks. All gas. Just a little bit off right now. And to that point, volatility was just in a newsletter where he was discussing Jerome Powell and what he had to say about Jerome."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1622000","1628000"," I don't expect Jerome to reverse course on like he's super hot."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1628000","1637000"," He doesn't have a history of doing that. There's no history of Jerome doing that anywhere in his career. He goes like ham."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1637000","1645000"," He gets more and more dovish for a long period of time. He overdoes things. We know that, right? He raised rates too fast."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1645000","1657000"," He, no, he delayed raising rates too, didn't he? He let the economy run hot, right? He does that. And then he slams the hammer down when he shouldn't, right? Max rates."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1657000","1672000"," So to think that Jerome's going to be at any point like not one or the other is probably inaccurate, at least historically inaccurate from his past experience."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1672000","1682000"," So I'm not expecting super hot Jerome to come out at this FMC be like, here's 50 BPS. He said he's not I'm not adversarial. The Fed is not adversarial."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1682000","1695000"," We will telegraph this stuff to you. And if anything at this Fed meeting, I would expect him to become even more dovish, even if he doesn't cut rates for language to change out there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1695000","1701000"," Okay, so we got going through, get through all that right there. Then we've got, um, what else do we have here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1701000","1710000"," Scared overnight financing. Oh, here we go. Solomon still inflation may prove stickier than anticipated. So I read this. I think he said this yesterday too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1710000","1719000"," I don't think this was from this morning. It says it was from 816, but I thought this was from yesterday. I thought I read this yesterday. So even just look at this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1719000","1729000"," Just mixed messages here from him, right? Just mixed messages. So I'm not expecting that from Jerome at all, like just just simple."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1729000","1742000"," Maybe maybe slightly more dovish. The US economy is more resilient than expected. He says, and he also says CEOs tell me consumer economic conditions are tougher."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1742000","1753000"," You don't need him to tell you that. We already know that it already is, but you guys are all still working. So that does matter, right? You guys all still have jobs. Some of you have two jobs, three jobs or whatever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1753000","1759000"," We are beginning to lose right now. Five, ten. Some doom and gloom out there on S&P 500."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1759000","1771000"," Well, we do have today on the 15th. We go scroll down. We have a 10 a.m. the consumer sentiments of preliminary. I guess I did. I say that it was Michigan sentiments. So we have consumer sentiments."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1771000","1781000"," Preliminary is at 10 a.m. today, but next week we've got a huge week coming up. We've got home builder confidence at 10 a.m. on Monday. We've got housing starts and building permits on Tuesday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1781000","1788000"," All the bad news on that stuff came out already for the winter. And then we've got the big one here right Wednesday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1788000","1796000"," At 2 p.m. We've got the FOMC rate decision. We have the Fed Chair Powell conference. Actually, let me circle back up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1796000","1804000"," I believe in the 19th, we have, I don't know, I think on the 18th, we've got SMCI inclusion in the."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1804000","1812000"," Inclusion on the S&P 500. And then on Tuesday, we have the NVDA event. And then on Wednesday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1812000","1822000"," We have FOMC and we have a Vickspiration. Vickspiration is fun. I don't know if you know a lot about Vickspiration, but we're going to put a post out about it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1822000","1827000"," It can be a lot of fun. And then believe it or not, the day before is a lot of fun."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1827000","1835000"," And Vickspiration. And then on Thursday, we have jobless claims, Philly Fed manufacturing survey PMIs."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1835000","1842000"," Existing home sales. And then Friday, nothing scheduled, right? But we do have something scheduled on Friday. We've got a end of month flows."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1842000","1853000"," And that's a lot of fun too. If you don't know how much fun that is, JPM collar, right? And what's fascinating about end of month flows are in quarter flows."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1853000","1862000"," You guys know it's fascinating about it. It's not just JPM. You get all kinds of people out there placing their hedging for the following quarter."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1862000","1876000"," And larger position makers. What do they do? Well, they don't disturb markets on a, well, they don't do that in general, but in a concentration of it in one day."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1876000","1891000"," So if a bank does not want to disturb markets, doesn't matter if the markets are in decline or if they're on an incline, they still do not want to disturb the normal flow of the markets all at the same time."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1891000","1902000"," So what does that mean? It means if I place a bearish bet, JPM does a bearish seagull, I think. If I'm wrong on that, let me know, but I think they do a bearish seagull."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1902000","1910000"," So if they're placing this bearish bet, what do they do when they place it? They place it in the morning. They buy a shit ton of zero day calls."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1910000","1917000"," That's what they do. Bunch of them, like tons of them. So those zero day calls come out, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1917000","1922000"," And the thesis here is that the dealers hedge against that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1922000","1931000"," Markets are slightly stabilized or at least going wherever they're normally going, but as the adult the rules off, the data rules off those calls."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1931000","1943000"," In the end of the day comes around, no matter where we're going, we tend to get a ramp into the end of the day. So we'll take very close attention to that as well, especially if you're a bull."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1943000","1953000"," No matter what happens on end of month, you're looking for that ramp into the end of the day. That's usually very profitable. You can make a ton of money on it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1953000","1961000"," So what does that what does all this mean? It means that next week. Hold on here. Did I do this right? I did this right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1961000","1967000"," We're going to switch over right now to the main screen. I'm on break right now, which I was."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1967000","1972000"," What does that mean for your next week? It means that we have volatility, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1972000","1980000"," Into next week. It begins on Monday and does not end until Friday, and you can see the weakness right here. Look at this doom and gloom right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1980000","1995000"," So in the last night's market brief, I said to you, if we lose 514, right? You lose 514, I think 30 something at any point to begin to hedge for the weekend, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","1995000","2002000"," You see traders see buyers leave the market. Any of that kind of stuff that you begin to hedge."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2002000","2015000"," I also talked to you in that market brief about on highs. Whenever we hit 518, 520, any of that kind of stuff that you are hedging for those drops in volatility next week."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2015000","2022000"," So whatever an extremes to on a low. So for a low, don't be scared. If we're at a high, don't be scared."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2022000","2032000"," You're buying dips on ranges that are much larger than normal. Does that make sense? So if we're really in a high, you're going to hedge 10 cent puts for the week for next week, next Friday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2032000","2039000"," If we're in a major low, you're going to buy those calls down there for an upside squeeze."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2040000","2045000"," No, so I'm wrong here. I got this wrong right here. We didn't come up at all. We failed on the one minute trigger right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2045000","2049000"," Whoop, they got us right there in the one minute trigger."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2049000","2061000"," So we're down below S1 right now. Target to the downside, 50775. Let me check the back, check the back stuff down here because I deleted all this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2061000","2066000"," I cleaned all that. It looked like a mess this morning. Right down there's one. Whoop."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2066000","2076000"," There's one buy bar right there. And here's your next buy bar right down there. Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2076000","2084000"," What's your next buy bar? And I've got calls on today, too. I've got a 20. I've got 50. I got a check, but I think I have 50."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2085000","2095000"," Five 20 C's for today's expiry. They were like six cents or something. They don't mean it. They don't cost anything. They're like fucking tiny, tiny, tiny."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2095000","2100000"," Let's see if we can take a trade here. I'm interested in taking one. Lots of doom here, huh?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2100000","2104000"," Five, 10, zero, three right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2109000","2112000"," You know what is nice though? I'll say this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2112000","2117000"," I've got this pretty big. I've got a pretty decent sized put spread in the market."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2117000","2122000"," And I just need the market to be below 525. Like 525 for 500."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2122000","2132000"," At expiry, I get full pay. If it goes down before expiry, I had this fucking thing on for like fucking a month."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2132000","2139000"," Like if we get in the front end of it, if I got below like 495, which we didn't, we like would hit 495."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2139000","2145000"," That was up like 50% or some shit like that, but I needed below 495 to get like full max pay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2145000","2152000"," But now the time has passed. All I got to do is standard 5.25. I'm going to get the full print. So I'm pretty happy here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2152000","2158000"," My calls are fucking one penny right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2158000","2162000"," Hold on one second here with you. Hink that with me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2170000","2173000"," I'm still having problems with tasty trade, man."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2173000","2202000"," Alright, I'm sitting on 511c. I haven't body yet."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2203000","2213000"," But I have a 25 contract sitting on 511c. They're costly. They're 95 cents right now. They're pretty expensive."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2213000","2221000"," Let's take a look at this and see if we can catch a, catch a reversal here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2221000","2225000"," See what happens here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2232000","2237000"," I'm going to make some money on a Friday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2237000","2241000"," What do we got here? SQ. We got SQ up this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2241000","2247000"," While we wait, I'm going to put up, so I'm going to check some of these bottom charts here for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2247000","2252000"," Happy Friday, by the way, out there. It's been a pretty good week."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2252000","2255000"," Should I write SQ or should I write block?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2255000","2260000"," There we go. SQ. Let's check a SPX gamma right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2260000","2263000"," Let's take a look at something here. This is fascinating."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2263000","2268000"," Remember the gap that was left unfilled down here? See that gap down here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2268000","2271000"," See this price right now? Look at this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2271000","2278000"," So you see all this? We got a green wick down below with a push. We never put, hold on here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2278000","2281000"," But I got to change this. Let me change something for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2281000","2286000"," I said that I would update the gamma this morning for you, so I will do that right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2286000","2291000"," Let me get the gamma profile for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2291000","2298000"," I'm going to read something else for you this morning. I'm going to give you guys another market brief here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2298000","2304000"," Change the gamma for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2304000","2310000"," You guys want to take a snapshot of this here in a moment? You can."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2310000","2314000"," Oh, nice. Really nice."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2314000","2318000"," So the gamma flip has moved up this morning. It's at 5150."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2318000","2321000"," This is the loosening of gamma on the market. I want to show you this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2321000","2323000"," Let's go down there and take a peek at it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2323000","2329000"," Bottom right inside. Move this over for you right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2329000","2331000"," Let's take a look at this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2331000","2337000"," So there's a new gamma profile, right? We talked about half the gamma rolling off the mark."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2337000","2339000"," Moving off the marketplace."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2339000","2341000"," And there's some structural changes today. Ready?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2341000","2343000"," Call wall has come down now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2343000","2346000"," And now sits at 5180."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2346000","2350000"," All right, this is gone now. We don't need this because the gamma is rolling off."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2350000","2352000"," All right, so that goes away."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2352000","2355000"," You got this is just saying that's picks gamma."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2355000","2359000"," You've got a gap to fill down below here. We still have a gap to fill down below here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2359000","2361000"," We still have a gap to fill down below here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2361000","2363000"," We never filled that gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2363000","2365000"," It's right over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2365000","2368000"," Maybe I move this around. This should be nicer over there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2368000","2370000"," Right there. There's that gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2370000","2372000"," Maybe we fill this gap. It's possible."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2372000","2375000"," But here's the most fascinating part."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2375000","2377000"," So this is your call wall, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2377000","2379000"," And this is going to be your new support."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2379000","2381000"," So right here is support."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2381000","2383000"," Maybe I should write it better."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2383000","2385000"," I shouldn't say support because you're going to be like,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2385000","2387000"," cop, those support broke."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2387000","2388000"," Local support."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2388000","2391000"," All right, local support right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2391000","2394000"," That's your local support. This is going to be now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2394000","2398000"," So right now we're going to find out we're in the middle of pile right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2412000","2414000"," Hold on. I'm going to try to execute this trade here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2414000","2417000"," This is the middle, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2417000","2422000"," The gamma flip is above at 51.50 right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2422000","2426000"," I'm going to watch this because I want to buy this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2426000","2432000"," What I don't want to get done is I don't want to get trapped in this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2432000","2434000"," And that's the real buy down there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2434000","2437000"," But you can't see it. Hold on a minute here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2438000","2440000"," Figure screen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2440000","2442000"," We're going to jump back to this in a minute."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2442000","2447000"," What I don't want to do is buy this and have it come right back down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2447000","2449000"," And that was the real dip buy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2449000","2451000"," So I'm watching this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2451000","2453000"," And I want to buy that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2453000","2457000"," Okay, so I want to buy 50775."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2457000","2460000"," But I'll tentatively watch this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2460000","2465000"," So if this can, if this can head higher, bounce around and start to turn,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2465000","2467000"," I'll take a trade right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2467000","2470000"," If we blast down here, I am definitely buying that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2470000","2474000"," So that's that 50775."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2474000","2479000"," I got a trade set up at 511, but we'll move that trade to a different strike"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2479000","2483000"," if we get down here to this 50775."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2483000","2485000"," So we're going to keep watching that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2485000","2490000"," I'm going to switch back over to the gamma, gamma screen down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2490000","2491000"," You put this up for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2491000","2495000"," If you want to take a snapshot of this, so that you have it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2495000","2497000"," Let me move my cursor."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2497000","2502000"," If you want to take a snippet of this, or if you want to."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2502000","2504000"," Yeah, that's local support."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2504000","2507000"," And this is real support down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2507000","2510000"," Let me put all of this up for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2510000","2512000"," There you go."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2512000","2514000"," I'll take a snap of that right there if you want."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2514000","2516000"," And look at that gap down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2516000","2518000"," Look at that juicy."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","2528000","2530000"," This is the sexy one right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2530000","2534000"," Let's do this one right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2534000","2537000"," Oh, yeah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2537000","2540000"," We'll make that one gray too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2540000","2541000"," Oh, yeah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2541000","2544000"," Bears do like, oh, I love it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2544000","2547000"," Close that gap cap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2547000","2552000"," Can I copy that copy paste?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2552000","2556000"," Oh, yeah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2556000","2561000"," All right, gap the fill."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2561000","2564000"," All right, bear."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2564000","2567000"," Oh, fuck."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2567000","2572000"," Yeah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2572000","2576000"," We'll put that one right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2576000","2579000"," Oh, no, I got to bring it to the front."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2579000","2581000"," Bring the front."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2581000","2582000"," All right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2582000","2583000"," Now, snip your finger."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2583000","2585000"," Snap your finger."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2585000","2587000"," Now, snap your picture."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2587000","2591000"," Flip that at home for yourselves."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","2593000","2597000"," Oh, fuck yeah, cap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2597000","2602000"," Okay, we're going to switch back now to the main screen."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","2835000","2837000"," We're going to review New Zealand."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2837000","2838000"," We're going to review Europe."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2838000","2844000"," We're going to review Japan and then we're coming into the US closed for the quarter."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2846000","2849000"," Still no trade from here. Just watching this down below."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2849000","2851000"," Got no trade down below."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2851000","2856000"," I'm going to leave the SPX gamma chart up for you just so that you can see it here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2856000","2859000"," Right down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2859000","2861000"," So you can watch this this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2861000","2863000"," I'm not going to go through."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2863000","2868000"," I'm not going to have to cycle through all of these different charts this morning because it is OpEx."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2868000","2870000"," I want you to be able to see where all of this stuff is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2870000","2873000"," So right down here, keep your eyes on it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2874000","2875000"," First line of support."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2875000","2876000"," Do you see it down here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2876000","2881000"," This is where these buyers were right back here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2881000","2884000"," These buyers don't look like they're here any longer."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2884000","2887000"," So we're going to look for this gap to get filled to the downside."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2887000","2888000"," You see it right here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2888000","2891000"," This gap should get filled here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2891000","2893000"," Look at how weak the response is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2893000","2896000"," Let me go back down here and show you this SPX screen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2896000","2900000"," And watch this right here with me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2901000","2903000"," Do you see how you've got?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2903000","2905000"," This is a 30 minute chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2905000","2908000"," You see how from here to here this week is beautiful."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2908000","2910000"," Showing you the buyers are showing up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2910000","2913000"," Do you see that here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2913000","2915000"," Not so much, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2915000","2916000"," Do you see this here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2916000","2918000"," Right down there, the push down, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2918000","2921000"," So they're pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2921000","2923000"," And what are they pushing for, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2923000","2925000"," Where's the next group of buyers?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2925000","2926000"," Right down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2927000","2929000"," So fair chance we continue to go down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2929000","2931000"," We're going to slide this over."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2931000","2932000"," We got a gap to fill, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2932000","2935000"," That's at 5092."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2935000","2937000"," You might get that this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2937000","2938000"," It's possible."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2938000","2939000"," So we'll leave this up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2939000","2941000"," This is 509."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2941000","2947000"," And that's relatively, relatively right about here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2947000","2949000"," Right where we are."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2949000","2951000"," Right about this area here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2951000","2955000"," So if we get one more little push down and try to buy that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2956000","2959000"," Close that up for you right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2959000","2961000"," See what happens here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2961000","2963000"," Watch out for a check back above."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2963000","2965000"," Watch out for a five minute check."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2965000","2968000"," But I would still be wary of that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2968000","2970000"," Still be wary of that happening."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2970000","2971000"," Five minute check back."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2971000","2974000"," And then possibly this rest of this down move down here to clear all that up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2974000","2976000"," Clear that gap down below."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2976000","2979000"," Let's keep our eyes on it here and watch."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2979000","2981000"," If I do see this happen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2982000","2983000"," I will be long."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2983000","2985000"," I'll show you exactly what I'm looking for."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2985000","2986000"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2986000","2987000"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2987000","2988000"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2988000","2991000"," Then some kind of a move up right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2991000","2997000"," So if I see that move up, I will begin to get long right in here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2997000","2999000"," So that's where I get long."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","2999000","3000000"," So that happens."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3000000","3001000"," No trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3001000","3004000"," We're going to try to make some money today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3004000","3006000"," So let's see if I can make some money."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3006000","3007000"," Close out Friday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3007000","3008000"," Really well."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3008000","3009000"," So you guys get out there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3009000","3010000"," I'm watching right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3010000","3011000"," If you guys get anything you want to add."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3011000","3012000"," If I didn't see a lot of your chat."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3012000","3014000"," So trying to like pay attention to the data for this morning and getting all the stuff"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3014000","3015000"," out to you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3015000","3016000"," Yes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3016000","3017000"," RGF is going to zero."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3017000","3018000"," Did they have their did."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3018000","3021000"," Did RGF have their ER yet or no?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3021000","3022000"," I was in a conference."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3022000","3023000"," So I want to talk."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3023000","3024000"," Let's talk about RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3024000","3025000"," So I had some private conversations about RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3025000","3026000"," I was in a conference."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3026000","3027000"," So I want to talk."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3027000","3028000"," Let's talk about RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3028000","3030000"," So I had some private conversations about RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3030000","3031000"," I was in a conference."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3031000","3032000"," I was in a conference."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3032000","3033000"," So I want to talk."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3033000","3034000"," Let's talk about RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3035000","3040000"," So I had some private conversations about RGF, but not public."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3040000","3041000"," They have not yet."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3041000","3043000"," I'll have that conversation now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3043000","3046000"," I've had these private conversations about RGF with people."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3046000","3050000"," I didn't want to have it on stream because I don't want to impact the price of RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3050000","3054000"," I'm afraid that if anything that I do will have an impact on it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3054000","3056000"," So I bought RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3056000","3058000"," The start of Q one."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3058000","3061000"," And I said, I will hold it for the quarter."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3061000","3063000"," When I said that, the price spiked."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3063000","3066000"," And I was like, fuck, that's not good."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3066000","3068000"," I said it on Twitter."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3068000","3073000"," And so I didn't make any more real commentary on it too much other than what I'm adding and stuff like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3073000","3075000"," Because I'm like, ah, it's kind of low."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3075000","3076000"," It's not quite low."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3076000","3077000"," It's actually not a low float stock."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3077000","3079000"," But I don't want to impact the price of the stock."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3079000","3083000"," So I held it for the quarter because I wanted to see an MNA take place."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3083000","3088000"," Now the price has continued to decline since then."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3088000","3090000"," And I've been asked by people, should I buy more?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3090000","3091000"," And I said, fuck no."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3091000","3092000"," And I never recommended to buy it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3092000","3093000"," People were buying it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3093000","3094000"," The America is recommended to me to buy it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3094000","3096000"," And I bought it on a recommendation."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3096000","3097000"," So I bought it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3097000","3098000"," And I was like, you know what I'm going to do?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3098000","3103000"," I'm going to hold it for the quarter regardless because I don't want to be accused of anything nefarious."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3103000","3107000"," So when I hold it for the quarter, then we are at the end of the quarter right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3107000","3110000"," And it is going into, it's going really low."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3110000","3114000"," And the reason it is is because of what was stated before."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3114000","3117000"," There was an activist investor claiming that the company is going to take it private."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3118000","3120000"," Now I was on hopes of an MNA."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3120000","3123000"," There are some options here with RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3123000","3126000"," RGF could reverse stock split."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3126000","3134000"," If that happens, you would see a sentiment, very positive sentiment, but it's usually short-lived."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3134000","3139000"," So if you ever see, if you see them come out in their ER and say we're doing a reverse stock split."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3139000","3143000"," And you see everybody going woohoo, it starts to blast up again."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3144000","3147000"," Do not believe that it's going to hold forever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3147000","3149000"," It'll be a short-lived thing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3150000","3152000"," You might care people say it's going bankrupt."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3152000","3154000"," It should not go bankrupt."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3154000","3159000"," I went and reviewed their stuff and they had consolidated all their debt really well."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3159000","3162000"," And so I don't see bankruptcy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3162000","3167000"," What I do see from the price action is it really fucking looks like taking it private to me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3167000","3170000"," If it does go private, that is really bad."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3170000","3176000"," If the C-suite takes that ticker private, they want the cheapest possible price."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3176000","3178000"," And that's what the action looks like."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3178000","3184000"," And also, there was Q3 and Q4 massive buying of RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3184000","3185000"," That's why I bought it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3185000","3190000"," There was massive, massive insider buying, massive institutional buying of that ticker."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3190000","3193000"," And so I was like, God, they're going to get an MNA coming."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3193000","3194000"," Definitely."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3195000","3199000"," And they dumped all of it through Q1."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3199000","3202000"," They just kept dumping it and dumping it and dumping it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3202000","3205000"," So I'm assuming that someone knows something."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3205000","3210000"," If I had to give a percentage into what I think is going to happen,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3210000","3219000"," it's probably 40% chance or 60% chance of taking it private, but that high 60 to 70%."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3220000","3230000"," There's a now 30% chance of some kind of a reverse stock split for MNA."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3230000","3232000"," The MNA has gone down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3232000","3236000"," Bankruptcy, 10%, 5%, very small chance."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3236000","3237000"," So I'm upset about RGF."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3237000","3238000"," I still own it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3238000","3242000"," I was going to add some to it this week at 50 cents."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3243000","3250000"," And I actually told a couple of guys that are in that trade with me that there's no fucking way that I'm adding to it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3250000","3254000"," I'm afraid that they're going to take that company private, which sucks."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3254000","3260000"," The worst part, too, is they're going to pay me for what they do as a deal as that stock."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3260000","3264000"," And I will have to probably eat a bag of dicks on that one."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3264000","3270000"," And I'll have to wait to get paid, too, so we kind of pissed."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3271000","3272000"," Do I pay for trade?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3272000","3274000"," No, I don't pay for trade anything anymore."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3274000","3276000"," No hunch is either."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3276000","3279000"," I took that risk intentionally for an MNA."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3279000","3282000"," So a couple of years ago, I took a couple of years ago."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3282000","3290000"," I don't do it anymore, but I used to have trade paramount on the MNA that they'll get an MNA."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3290000","3295000"," And I think three times in a row, I made 400% on those trades."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3295000","3298000"," 300% on one of them, 400% on another one."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3298000","3304000"," So like paramount, all the streaming companies were discussing consolidation."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3304000","3309000"," They blasted down a bunch of these companies, and I'm like, dude, we're coming into MNA season."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3309000","3313000"," And they started talking about that shit happening, and that shit just ramped."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3313000","3324000"," So I always, every year, like Q1, I look for companies that have good, either good fundamentals or they're making something real."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3324000","3329000"," And their stock has gotten destroyed for a takeover bid."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3329000","3330000"," And this one I lost."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3330000","3333000"," Normally, I don't lose too many of these, but this one, I think I'm going to lose."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3333000","3334000"," I don't know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3334000","3336000"," I still own it, so I'm not selling it either."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3336000","3337000"," It just stays there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3337000","3339000"," They either take that shit private or I stay on it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3339000","3343000"," So then I'm in for about $1.30 if you want to know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3343000","3344000"," $1.20."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3344000","3347000"," No, I have it over there, but it's like $1.30 or something like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3347000","3349000"," So I don't pay for trade anything."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3349000","3352000"," So but I have in the past, I have paper traded."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3353000","3354000"," It doesn't, it's not the same."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3354000","3355000"," There's no, there's no same with it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3355000","3356000"," So."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3360000","3368000"," S or gamma lab tweets saying S pick sporting negative dealer gamma in balance now trading in a tone with large zero day gamma concentration."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3368000","3370000"," Yeah, I'm about to go long here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3370000","3371000"," So I don't really care."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3373000","3374000"," I'm about to go long right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3375000","3378000"," Did you guys get the Tesla chart from me last night?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3378000","3380000"," So supporters should have gotten that chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3380000","3384000"," I want you to know that that Tesla chart is a one day year long chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3384000","3391000"," So there will be, there will be on your intraday stuff is going to look a lot different than that chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3391000","3392000"," I wanted to be aware of that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3392000","3399000"," I wanted to say that in the post last night, but it didn't have any time I was fucking dead, dude."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3399000","3400000"," Yesterday morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3400000","3402000"," So but that chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3402000","3404000"," I'm liking that chart, dude."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3404000","3406000"," Pretty much."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3406000","3410000"," I didn't say this in the market brief last night either, and I should have."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3410000","3414000"," I'm watching Tesla and I W M for the ramp."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3414000","3418000"," The ramp and whatever we expect to actually cut rates."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3418000","3422000"," Whenever that turnaround comes around in those in those stocks and in that index,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3422000","3428000"," it's going to be a front running of the rate rate cut expectation trade that's coming."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3428000","3431000"," Dude, I want this right now, man."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3431000","3433000"," I'm fucking starving for this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3433000","3434000"," Look at this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3435000","3437000"," I want that bad."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3439000","3440000"," Not yet, though."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3440000","3441000"," I don't want to see this happen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3441000","3443000"," I don't want to see like, yeah, everything's awesome."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3443000","3445000"," We go down there and that's the real bounce down there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3445000","3448000"," So still sitting on my hands, not doing anything at this moment."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3448000","3450000"," No trade jet for me today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3453000","3455000"," That's the triggers look bad."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3455000","3457000"," Nvidia back alive."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3457000","3458000"," Shaq."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3458000","3459000"," Thanks for saying something."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3459000","3460000"," They go over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3460000","3461000"," Hold on a second."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3462000","3464000"," Dude, my cat last night, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3465000","3467000"," Came into my office last night."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3469000","3470000"," And like destroyed it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3471000","3472000"," Came to my office this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3472000","3474000"," I'm like, what the fuck is going on in here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3475000","3478000"," Like ripping drapes down, like literally ripping drapes down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3479000","3481000"," Like I got monitors, a skew."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3484000","3486000"," And like went, went full ham."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3487000","3489000"," Mia, let me move some of this over so you can see it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3491000","3493000"," I'm going to just get, I'm going to get rid of some of this here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3493000","3495000"," I want you to visualize with this in your mind, okay?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3498000","3500000"," So I can just watch this trade as develops."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3507000","3509000"," We've got a HYG turning around to the upside."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3510000","3511000"," Dixie's looking pretty good."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3511000","3512000"," Not too bad at dollar 343."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3513000","3516000"," I know like, so Dixie is at a bottom, even though that it's at a top."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3516000","3518000"," I like to see Dixie right around a dollar."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3518000","3519000"," If you guys don't know, this is simplified."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3519000","3521000"," You guys, you guys want a simplified way to look at Dixie."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3523000","3526000"," You want to see Dixie at about a dollar three for normalcy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3526000","3528000"," Or I do right now, but a dollar three."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3529000","3532000"," I never want to see Dixie at a dollar four as a bull."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3532000","3533000"," Let me rephrase all of this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3534000","3538000"," If you don't want to see Dixie at a dollar four or as a bull,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3538000","3539000"," let me rephrase all of this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3539000","3542000"," If you guys don't track, you're a young trader, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3542000","3544000"," I'll give you a simple way to watch Dixie."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3544000","3546000"," That's the Dixie, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3546000","3547000"," It's the dollar."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3547000","3551000"," So right now, you want to see, or right now if you're a bull,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3551000","3557000"," you like to see the Dixie top out at about a dollar three and change."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3557000","3559000"," That signifies a bottom in the market."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3559000","3563000"," If you begin to see dollar four, dollar five, run."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3563000","3565000"," That's really bad for equities."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3565000","3566000"," Right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3566000","3570000"," If you begin to see Dixie roll down off of about a dollar forty,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3570000","3574000"," dollar fifty starts coming down, you start buying dips."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3574000","3577000"," So that's about like the bottom for you as a bull."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3577000","3581000"," If you start, if you start seeing Dixie go down to a dollar,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3581000","3585000"," start closing your lungs and watch out because it's going to blast up"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3585000","3586000"," that dollar three range."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3586000","3588000"," And then a dollar is really low."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3588000","3590000"," To be like a dollar ten would be nice."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3590000","3593000"," That range, like a dollar ten, dollar thirty somewhere in there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3593000","3594000"," Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3594000","3597000"," And the Dixie right now is got two tops on it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3597000","3600000"," It's about a dollar, or a dollar three point forty one."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3600000","3602000"," So it's getting a little long in the tooth right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3602000","3606000"," We've got a gap above on HYG that you want to see closed out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3606000","3609000"," Now as Zach trying to claw its way back right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3609000","3610000"," Vicks."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3610000","3612000"," I'm going to show you a little bit more about it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3612000","3614000"," HYG that you want to see closed out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3614000","3617000"," Now as Zach trying to claw its way back right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3617000","3618000"," Vicks."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3618000","3620000"," Did it close the gap or no?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3620000","3623000"," Vicks has a little bit more gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3623000","3626000"," It's leaving behind at fifteen twenty seven."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3626000","3631000"," Tesla still bleeding trading a dollar six or a hundred sixty one dollars."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3631000","3635000"," SMLR looks like it's turning around right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3635000","3637000"," And that's all I got to be right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3637000","3638000"," Fuck dude."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3638000","3640000"," Those calls are now a dollar six."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3640000","3643000"," They were ninety five cents a few minutes ago."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3643000","3648000"," Little bit of premium coming into Tesla calls right now or spy calls right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3648000","3650000"," Dollar six they were trading ninety five cents."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3650000","3651000"," Just a moment to go."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3651000","3653000"," Don't want to get trapped in here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3653000","3656000"," Don't want to get pulled into any kind of a roll over and down here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3656000","3659000"," So I'm not going to take this trade just yet."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3659000","3662000"," I'd really like to wrap up a Friday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3662000","3663000"," Happy as fuck."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3663000","3665000"," For a bunch of money in my pocket."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3666000","3668000"," Yeah bag of dicks."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3671000","3672000"," Oh dude Jimmy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3672000","3676000"," So my wife woke up this morning with a sore throat."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","3693000","3697000"," I've got did I got someone claiming that they're a fucking owner and shit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3697000","3700000"," I got some wack shit going on in the background."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","3701000","3702000"," So."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4007000","4009000"," I am not doing it without."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4009000","4015000"," I'm doing it with a with a road bike, but I have what I haven't built it yet."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4025000","4026000"," And it's not because I can't."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4026000","4028000"," It's because of my knees."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4028000","4029000"," So I am."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4029000","4031000"," I am riding an electric bike this year."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4031000","4033000"," I want to enjoy myself."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4033000","4037000"," I want to ride from town to town and not be feeling beaten up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4037000","4040000"," And I want to enjoy each town and have a good time."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4040000","4043000"," So if you are interested in that ride."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4045000","4047000"," If you're interested in that ride."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4048000","4050000"," I'll make a channel in the discord today."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4067000","4068000"," We can do it together."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4073000","4074000"," I'm not either."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4074000","4075000"," So that's another thing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4075000","4076000"," I'm not a road bike."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4076000","4077000"," So I don't."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4077000","4078000"," I don't ride."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4079000","4080000"," I've got a."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4080000","4082000"," I've got a quiver of bikes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4082000","4087000"," But most of my concrete riding is like a city bike."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4087000","4089000"," So I've got a city bike."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4089000","4092000"," I ride a city bike a lot."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4092000","4093000"," Because I am in Michigan."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4093000","4096000"," But I'm mostly a single track kind of guy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4096000","4099000"," And I like the loopy loops and the roundabouts and all that stuff."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4099000","4100000"," I'm not a downhill guy anymore."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4100000","4101000"," I can't do it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4101000","4103000"," And I like lift service."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4103000","4104000"," I'm older."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4104000","4105000"," I like lift service."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4105000","4107000"," But if I can pump."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4107000","4109000"," On a loopy loop single track."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4109000","4112000"," Like enduro, but enduro, but you know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4112000","4114000"," That's the kind of mountain bike I like to do."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4114000","4116000"," Single track, beautiful, sexy like mountains."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4116000","4117000"," I like."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4122000","4123000"," Where else?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4123000","4124000"," Southern Utah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4124000","4126000"," Not Moab, but the other one."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4126000","4128000"," I feel that place called."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4128000","4129000"," Anyways."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4129000","4131000"," That's my kind of riding style."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4131000","4132000"," Now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4132000","4133000"," I'm not a road biker."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4133000","4134000"," So I'm like, I don't."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4134000","4135000"," A lot of guys get enjoyment."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4135000","4136000"," I just road biking."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4136000","4137000"," I understand the concept."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4137000","4138000"," I've ridden in pack."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4138000","4140000"," I've ridden a pack road before."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4140000","4141000"," But I'm not good at it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4141000","4143000"," I enjoy watching a Tour de France, but."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4143000","4145000"," I will never be that guy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4145000","4148000"," Daniel biking is crazy as fuck."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4148000","4149000"," I got."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4149000","4150000"," So I got a great."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4151000","4152000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4152000","4153000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4153000","4154000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4154000","4155000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4155000","4156000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4156000","4157000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4157000","4158000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4158000","4159000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4159000","4160000"," I got a great."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4160000","4165000"," One of my close friends is a professional downhill rider from Park City, Utah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4165000","4168000"," And I don't know how he does it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4168000","4170000"," It's fucking crazy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4170000","4172000"," I can't do it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4172000","4173000"," I can't."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4173000","4176000"," To know that these guys were like full."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4176000","4180000"," These guys were like with dirt bike riders where they have like body armor."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4180000","4181000"," They get."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4181000","4184000"," They get spine spinal cord protection."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4184000","4186000"," They get all kinds of wild."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4186000","4187000"," They look like a dirt bike rider."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4188000","4189000"," Downhill riders."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4189000","4190000"," But it's insane."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4190000","4194000"," Like you get killed easily downhill riding easily."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4194000","4195000"," Oh shit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4195000","4198000"," If you do the right single track, it's dangerous as fuck to you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4198000","4200000"," Just some single track out and like Moab."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4200000","4201000"," Super sketchy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4201000","4205000"," Like you just look down the sides of these trails and it's like 600 foot drop."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4205000","4206000"," Straight down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4206000","4209000"," You got a trail that's like 12 inches wide."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4209000","4216000"," Get my like around."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4216000","4218000"," Well, that's the other thing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4218000","4220000"," So NorCal Joe just said something."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4220000","4221000"," Come on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4221000","4222000"," Get your like run."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4222000","4226000"," If you do come on this ride with me, I will be dressed like super trash."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4226000","4228000"," I will have a banana hammock on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4228000","4230000"," I will have like her on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4230000","4234000"," I will have like the full one piece fucking suit and it's going to be ugly."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4234000","4243000"," I'll have like, I'll have my butt pads on and my butt lubon and I'll be lubing up the"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4243000","4245000"," butt hole and all that stuff."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4245000","4248000"," I'm going to go full bike."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4248000","4250000"," I'm going to go full dork."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4250000","4253000"," I'm going to get an idiot."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4253000","4255000"," So I'll make that channel right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4255000","4258000"," If you are interested in that ride."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4258000","4263000"," I am bringing a I am bringing RV."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4263000","4267000"," I don't know that I'll sleep in it, but there'll be a hopefully a bit shower and electricity."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4267000","4271000"," If you will need to charge bikes generator, all that kind of stuff."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4271000","4273000"," And I'll sleep outside with you if you want."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4273000","4275000"," If you want to go cheap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4275000","4279000"," If you like just get your you can have it says two ways to go."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4279000","4281000"," I'm still watching this over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4281000","4283000"," There's two ways to do it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4283000","4286000"," I don't recommend being a bandit, but you can."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4286000","4288000"," A ton of that race is bandit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4288000","4289000"," It's about it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4289000","4290000"," Sometimes they admit it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4290000","4295000"," Sometimes they don't, but like about 30% of that rate or that ride are bandits."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4295000","4300000"," That means you don't pay anything and they don't know that you're there, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4300000","4301000"," Look at that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4301000","4304000"," Nice support forming right here on book map."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4304000","4308000"," So I might just buy this shit or no."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4308000","4310000"," Should just buy this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4310000","4311000"," I'm so teased right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4311000","4312000"," Take risk."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4312000","4314000"," So anyways, you can go bandit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4314000","4323000"," If you don't go bandit, it's very cheap relatively to get a pass or become a certified rider or whatever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4323000","4326000"," But then from there, it can get very expensive."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4326000","4328000"," And that's the issue, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4329000","4334000"," If you pay for like a sag wagon to bring your gear, that kind of stuff, that gets a pricey."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4334000","4340000"," So if you ever want to meet up there, like drive your car there or fly in and throw your shit inside the RV."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4340000","4342000"," If I have the room, you can put it in there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4342000","4344000"," And if you want to go cheap, you can."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4344000","4349000"," And you go from town to town and you do some crazy stuff, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4349000","4350000"," You go to a town, they have music."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4350000","4353000"," They got like super slides and backyard slippery slides."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4353000","4358000"," And they got, you know, pet the animals and big bands and dancing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4358000","4363000"," If you take an electric bike, it's like riding a motorcycle, dude."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4363000","4364000"," It's so easy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4364000","4366000"," It's too easy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4366000","4369000"," Gap to fill up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4369000","4370000"," You can see this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4370000","4372000"," Let's see the little mini gap right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4372000","4375000"," So little mini gap needs to be filled."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4375000","4377000"," Let's even catch that fill."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4377000","4378000"," It's right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4378000","4380000"," Here's the gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4381000","4388000"," See if we can get that gap fill up top."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4388000","4391000"," See what happens here in this test, the one minute trigger."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4391000","4396000"," So if you want to go, I'm totally down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4396000","4399000"," I'm an easy person to get along with in real life."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4399000","4402000"," I don't know how you know me here on the stream, but in real life."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4402000","4403000"," I like to have a good time."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4403000","4408000"," So if you want to like go do a bike ride with me, I'm pretty easy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4408000","4411000"," You got to get along with as long as you like to have fun."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4411000","4412000"," Nothing too crazy."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4412000","4414000"," I don't do anything illegal or anything like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4414000","4416000"," But you like to have a good time."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4416000","4418000"," Go for a bike ride."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4418000","4422000"," Look like a dork and make friends and meet people from all over the world."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4422000","4423000"," It's a blast."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4423000","4424000"," Any of that kind of stuff like that's a blast."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4424000","4426000"," You make friends for life."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4426000","4428000"," And you'll see people that you know from other places."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4428000","4431000"," Like you'll be like, oh, dude, I met you once at this bike festival."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4431000","4433000"," Dude, I met you once over there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4433000","4435000"," Dude, I met you at this other place."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4436000","4438000"," All those people, all those people show up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4446000","4447000"," I'm going to make the channel right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4447000","4448000"," Hold on a second."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4448000","4449000"," I'll make the channel right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4451000","4452000"," Let's see."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4452000","4454000"," Mark's going to be mad at me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4456000","4458000"," He's into like, what is this guy doing?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4460000","4461000"," Let me see if I can make a channel here."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4463000","4465000"," We got to have some fun out there, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4465000","4467000"," I'm going to mix this with a little bit of fun."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4468000","4470000"," Create a channel text."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4471000","4473000"," Rag-bry."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4478000","4479000"," All right, here we go."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4479000","4480000"," Oh, shitty."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4480000","4481000"," There he is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4481000","4482000"," I'm in trouble."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4482000","4483000"," I'm in so much trouble."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4484000","4485000"," Pork's here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4485000","4486000"," I'm doomed."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4488000","4489000"," I'm busted."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4490000","4491000"," It's going to be."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4491000","4492000"," Oh, should I call it?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4492000","4493000"," Oh, butt grease and bikes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4493000","4494000"," That's what I'm going to call it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4495000","4496000"," That's even better."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4496000","4497000"," Rag-bry."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4498000","4500000"," Should we call it team?"

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4877000","4886000"," So I bought the Chinese motor and the Chinese battery from Ali Baba."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4886000","4888000"," And it wasn't too bad."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4888000","4890000"," So a couple of things on bikes here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4890000","4892000"," You can rent bikes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4892000","4896000"," The second thing on bikes, you can get like an old beat up."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4916000","4918000"," There's another cool thing too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4918000","4920000"," If you're like serious about it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4920000","4922000"," Bikes direct."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4922000","4928000"," Is like a Taiwanese bike manufacturer that makes bikes for famous bike companies like high end shit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4928000","4932000"," Like five, six grand, 10 grand, 15 grand bikes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4932000","4934000"," It's something like a thousand bucks."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4934000","4936000"," So you can get a road bike."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4936000","4941000"," I think on bikes direct for like 300 bucks, 500 bucks, something like that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4941000","4944000"," Get yourself a motor and you know, you rock and roll."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4948000","4952000"," You know, if you look at, so if you look at the bikes on bike direct, they're exact copies."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4952000","4957000"," They're the same fucking bike as like specialized, like exact same bike."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4958000","4960000"," Oh, yeah, dude."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","4965000","4966000"," Kick ass."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4969000","4970000"," It's in Iowa."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4970000","4972000"," You, it's a ride across Iowa."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4972000","4976000"," It's the longest bike ride across America."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4976000","4981000"," It's the, it's the, it's the biggest like organized bike ride in the United States."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4981000","4983000"," So I want to put on my bucket list to be done with it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4983000","4985000"," I feel like I did this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4985000","4987000"," So yeah, I'm going to do it this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4987000","4989000"," I'm going to do it this summer."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4989000","4990000"," Iowa."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4990000","4992000"," It's spelled R-A-I."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4992000","4996000"," No, R-A-G-B-R-A-I."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4996000","4999000"," And if you want to get involved, or if you want to at least find out something about it,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","4999000","5001000"," there's a rag-brag community on Reddit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5001000","5005000"," And there's even a larger community on Facebook."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5005000","5011000"," I'm not a Facebooker, but they supposedly have a really large community on Facebook as well."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5014000","5016000"," Yeah, so this is another good one."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5016000","5020000"," So Brawl in the Mall is saying very, two very important things."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5020000","5022000"," One, make sure that you get sized."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5022000","5027000"," Even if you buy it on Facebook marketplace, get yourself sized at a bike shop."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5027000","5029000"," So that you know what size you need."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5029000","5032000"," And the second most important, well, you got one, two, and three."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5032000","5034000"," I mean, then four maybe."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5034000","5036000"," Correct size cost you nothing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5036000","5041000"," Get yourself a used saddle."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5042000","5044000"," So that's your butt seat."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5044000","5045000"," And make sure it's of quality."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5045000","5048000"," Now, some saddles can be very expensive."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5048000","5049000"," So do some research."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5049000","5055000"," You can get quality saddle for cheap, or a used quality saddle, expensive saddle, really cheap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5055000","5059000"," But your ass is like number two, hands down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5059000","5061000"," You do not want your ass to be hurting."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5061000","5064000"," Number three would be handlebars."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5064000","5069000"," For long rides, you will probably want multiple positions."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5069000","5072000"," And the last part would be what?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5072000","5080000"," Some good shammies for your butt, again, back to your butt."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5080000","5081000"," Yep, that's right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5081000","5082000"," Des Moines Register."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5082000","5083000"," That's right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5083000","5086000"," Register is rag-ry."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5086000","5088000"," You already have an expensive hobby."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5088000","5090000"," What is that binary dragon?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5090000","5094000"," What is it?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5094000","5095000"," Yeah, a good fit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5095000","5096000"," Definitely."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5096000","5098000"," The fit is key."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5098000","5099000"," Oh, that is expensive."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5099000","5104000"," That is expensive."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5104000","5106000"," You got your first telescope."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5106000","5108000"," So that telescope last fall."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5108000","5110000"," Where do you live?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5110000","5113000"," You don't have to say exactly what state you live in."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5113000","5120000"," Do you have dark sky where you live?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5120000","5123000"," That's sensitive bits."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5123000","5125000"," Oh, nice dude."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5125000","5127000"," Hell yeah."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5128000","5132000"," Canada has got a bunch of dark sky, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5132000","5134000"," Are you up in Quebec?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5134000","5135000"," Are you up in Montreal?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5135000","5136000"," Where are you at?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5136000","5137000"," Sherbrooke?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5137000","5138000"," Newfoundland?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5138000","5139000"," Where are you at?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5139000","5141000"," I used to date a girl up there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5141000","5145000"," A date a girl in Montreal for three years."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5145000","5148000"," Yeah, I see the rip too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5148000","5156000"," I see the rip."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5156000","5160000"," Your target's right here, the screen bar."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5160000","5162000"," This is where the spoons..."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5162000","5163000"," Oh, we're good."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5163000","5167000"," We just closed the spoons gap right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5167000","5168000"," So the gap is now closed."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5168000","5170000"," I thought the gap was above."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5170000","5171000"," It's actually right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5171000","5173000"," I got that wrong."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5173000","5174000"," This is the gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5174000","5179000"," It's getting filled right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5179000","5180000"," I apologize for that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5180000","5185000"," I thought it was higher."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5185000","5190000"," The gap is now filled on SPX on the intraday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5190000","5195000"," I used to have a nice telescope when I lived out west."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5195000","5197000"," I used to go to the New Mexico sky."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5197000","5199000"," It's like an upside down ocean."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5199000","5201000"," I don't have one here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5201000","5204000"," And there's a big dark sky park, I guess, in Michigan."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5204000","5207000"," I don't know a lot about Michigan."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5207000","5211000"," I don't know the five finger bullshit, but I don't understand it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5211000","5212000"," But there's a dark sky park."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5212000","5219000"," I want to go, I haven't been."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5219000","5220000"," I see it right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5220000","5221000"," The gap is right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5221000","5222000"," It's already been closed."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5222000","5225000"," It's right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5225000","5227000"," See it?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5227000","5231000"," This is the gap I'm talking about, I should say."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5231000","5236000"," Then we have the bigger gap, and that's right up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5236000","5238000"," That'll see any gap here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5238000","5241000"," That gap is closed."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5241000","5257000"," We're starting at $0.95, so now $1.25, $1.27."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5257000","5260000"," Just note here that this is where resistance is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5260000","5265000"," We should make that yellow or yellow, not green."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5265000","5275000"," It's not big, but a little bit of resistance."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5275000","5278000"," Let's see what happens here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5278000","5283000"," I'm going to remove the pivots for the moments that you can see, where the hourly trigger"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5283000","5284000"," is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5284000","5289000"," That's the target on the upside."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5289000","5291000"," Maybe you mean this gap right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5291000","5293000"," You're talking about this gap?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5293000","5296000"," All that bullshit there, all that scam, scam, scam dump?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5296000","5299000"," Yeah, I guess you could call that a gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5299000","5301000"," I would too, I'd call that a gap."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5301000","5307000"," You're right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5307000","5309000"," $5.11 is now trading."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5309000","5312000"," $1.40 right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5312000","5317000"," They were at $0.95, so they're about 50% right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5317000","5318000"," I'm not on them."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5318000","5337000"," I didn't take trade, so."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5337000","5339000"," $1.48 on that trade right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5339000","5340000"," $0.95, so $1.48."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5340000","5341000"," I didn't take it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5341000","5343000"," I'm looking for a little back test here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5343000","5361000"," Let's see if I can jump on this trade with you in just a minute."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5361000","5366000"," Oh yeah, I think we can go to $5.18 today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5366000","5369000"," What bears are looking for here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5369000","5371000"," Maybe I could just ask the question."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5371000","5378000"," If you're a bear, and on the Discord this morning I mentioned it to somebody else, I said,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5378000","5380000"," if you're a bull, you want price?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5380000","5383000"," Hold on, I do this like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5383000","5387000"," It's a good learning lesson right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5387000","5388000"," Trigger screen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5388000","5389000"," Okay, good learning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5389000","5395000"," I got a learning lesson for you, okay?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5396000","5398000"," So on this hourly trigger right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5398000","5399000"," Hold on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5399000","5400000"," Let me show you this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5400000","5404000"," It's a good lesson right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5404000","5410000"," So on this hourly trigger, there's two things I want you to know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5410000","5416000"," The more time we spend underneath it, the more bearish it becomes."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5416000","5419000"," And sustained bearishness."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5419000","5423000"," Sustained."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5423000","5428000"," The faster that we go underneath it, the more violent it is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5428000","5432000"," The higher probability that we come straight back up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5432000","5435000"," Okay, so those are some key points."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5435000","5438000"," That is for the upside too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5438000","5443000"," So let's say we come up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5443000","5444000"," Right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5444000","5446000"," And we squeeze."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5446000","5450000"," I would expect price to immediately drop straight back down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5450000","5452000"," Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5452000","5458000"," I prefer to come up and solidate for three hours."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5458000","5462000"," That's wrong."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5462000","5465000"," And this would become a sustained move higher."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5465000","5466000"," Make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5466000","5469000"," Hopefully it does."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5469000","5472000"," So I do expect this to come up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5472000","5476000"," No matter what this overreaching thing is, I expect this to come back."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5476000","5479000"," I do expect to come back all up to the hourly trigger."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5479000","5480000"," Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5480000","5482000"," It's not all the time, but I expect it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5482000","5483000"," Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5483000","5485000"," It's like 70% of the time."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5485000","5488000"," It's pretty, pretty hot."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5488000","5493000"," Now, regardless of you're a bearable."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5493000","5501000"," What a bull here in this particular case does not want to see is we come back and we reject."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5501000","5505000"," If you see that, it is very bearish."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5505000","5516000"," In the discord this morning, I was asked a question and I said someone said to me this"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5516000","5519000"," morning, are we buying calls?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5519000","5522000"," And I said, do we have price?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5522000","5526000"," One minute, five minutes and hourly trigger?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5526000","5530000"," And then I said, and also have we back checked it yet?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5530000","5532000"," And we didn't have any of those conditions."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5533000","5538000"," So I was like, well, without those conditions, we can't take a fucking call."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5538000","5540000"," And the same thing applies here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5540000","5547000"," The bears, they want to get a rejection, the confirmation trade to the downside."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5547000","5550000"," And the same would hold true for the bear, the bulls."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5550000","5556000"," So if we squeeze up here, the initial squeeze is not the trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5556000","5560000"," It's that second consolidation."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5560000","5565000"," When you start coming up here, it's proving to you that we're going higher, that the strength"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5565000","5567000"," is here for the upside move."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5567000","5571000"," This is where your percentages get better and better and better."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5571000","5580000"," And you get a sustained move, like you're talking like one to five days of a sustained move here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5580000","5583000"," And so the same thing applies for the downside."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5583000","5584000"," There's no difference here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5584000","5587000"," It's the same whether you're a bull or a bear."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5587000","5592000"," So if you're a bull or a bear, you're watching for whatever this turns into."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5592000","5595000"," Even if we go up right now, which I'm going to hold on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5607000","5609000"," Dude, I'm having severe problems here with trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5609000","5611000"," I can't take a trade right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5612000","5614000"," My tasty is fucked up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5617000","5619000"," I got a frozen tasty trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5626000","5629000"," I still have a, I'm sorry, I can't take a trade with you guys."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5642000","5644000"," All right, so I'm having problems this morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5651000","5652000"," All right, I'm a man."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5652000","5654000"," I mean, I'm not in, but I got."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5661000","5662000"," I may not be trading today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5662000","5663000"," I need to find a new broker."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5676000","5681000"," All right, so if I was to take a trade right now, I'm going to show you what that trade is."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5684000","5687000"," I'm looking for the back test pack on a cross for a bull trade right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5693000","5700000"," I'm going to draw this out better for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5700000","5701000"," Hold on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5703000","5705000"," See, can't fucking win."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5707000","5710000"," It's like right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5716000","5717000"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5723000","5726000"," There would be my trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5726000","5728000"," I'm not trading right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5728000","5737000"," I've got tasty traders like not like one click of work and then four or five clicks don't"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5737000","5738000"," work."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5738000","5739000"," So whatever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5744000","5745000"," Let me go over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5753000","5760000"," So I, so I, I trade zero dates sometimes with risk, but just not a ton."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5760000","5762000"," It's not a ton of money."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5771000","5773000"," I'm missing some of you guys are right in there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5773000","5775000"," Is this screen freezing on you or no?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5783000","5786000"," A trades B trade solves all that confusion."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5786000","5788000"," No, I tell you guys in every trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5789000","5790000"," So let me draw it up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5790000","5792000"," I'll make it really simple for you guys want it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5792000","5793000"," We'll do it right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5794000","5795000"," I say it every day."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5795000","5797000"," So Turkey saying there's some confusion here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5797000","5798000"," I'll just draw it out for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5798000","5799000"," Make it simple."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5799000","5800000"," Snap this at home."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5800000","5801000"," Okay."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5801000","5802000"," Make this really simple."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5807000","5809000"," How do we do this?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5810000","5811000"," Like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5816000","5817000"," Just like this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5817000","5819000"," Oh, let's go to a, let's go to the trigger screen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5819000","5820000"," Right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5824000","5826000"," Maybe I'll, I got to snip this myself."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5826000","5827000"," Hold on."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5832000","5833000"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5833000","5834000"," Real simple."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5835000","5837000"," I thought I have an educational business."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5837000","5839000"," Maybe I need to make this educational video."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","5946000","5947000"," F."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5947000","5953720"," Now, why do I say D&M?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5953720","5954720"," That's do not follow."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5954720","5955720"," Okay?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5955720","5962400"," So if you ever see me take a trade right here, let's say I take 10 contracts at 10 cents."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5962400","5964560"," That's $100, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5964560","5967000"," What do you think $100 is to me?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5967000","5970520"," It's probably different than what it is for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5970520","5979360"," So if you have a job that pays $1,000 a week, and you're trading 10% of your accounts right"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5979360","5983880"," here, you have no business in here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5983880","5986040"," Why is that?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5986040","5998920"," This trade to turn to the upside has about a 15% win rate right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","5998920","6001760"," This trade right here is to continue up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6001760","6009880"," We're talking about taking this trade to get to up here, 15%."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6009880","6016160"," You'll see some people trade this and leave the trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6016160","6019720"," So they'll start the trade right here, and they'll exit right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6019720","6021320"," They'll do it on futures too."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6021320","6023720"," They'll take just that part of the trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6023720","6025400"," Does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6025400","6031920"," So if you're watching me on stream, and I do this on stream and I don't tell you, why"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6031920","6034360"," don't I tell you that I'm taking that trade?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6034360","6039520"," Because by the time I look at the strike, by the time I tell you, by the time you're"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6039520","6049120"," copy trading me, I'm in and I'm out and you're just taking the trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6049120","6050440"," So I stopped doing that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6050440","6055920"," I used to do that on the show, and you guys would stay long and get blown out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6055920","6059280"," So now I don't tell you about that trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6059280","6065360"," This one right here is about 30%."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6065360","6071800"," We had problems with people copy trading me, that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6072280","6083960"," That trade is only good, or wherever they'll pry or pry or like a, you'll see like a nub"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6083960","6084960"," rate."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6084960","6088880"," Oh wait a minute, hold on here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6088880","6098360"," Usually this is like a point of interest right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6098360","6104840"," So this one right here is at about a 30% win rate, 15% win rate for this conclusion"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6104840","6107960"," up here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6107960","6109400"," This is a do not follow."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6109400","6124360"," That one has about a 45% win rate, maybe even 60, I give this one about a 60%, you could"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6124360","6129440"," possibly assign about a 60% win rate here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6129440","6140520"," Now this one right here has a probability of about 70, ready for this?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6140520","6150400"," 90% win rate, I guess that zero sucks right there, it would be larger, okay?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6150400","6156640"," So if you're trying to or attempting, which you shouldn't be anyways, you said it again"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6156640","6163120"," very clearly, you should not ever be trying to copy trade me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6163120","6167160"," You do not ever take my trades, I already know that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6167160","6172520"," I already know that you don't ever follow me in all my trades, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6172520","6174640"," I already know what you do out there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6174640","6178320"," You take the trades that you're like, I'm going to make a million dollars today."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6178320","6180920"," And you're like, ah, cap, I'm not doing that trade with you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6180920","6183720"," Ah, cap, I'll jump on it at the top, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6183720","6188440"," So there's all those issues and there's the timing that's an issue."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6188440","6192160"," So if you're watching me on stream and then there's another issue, how much are you putting"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6192160","6193160"," in?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6193160","6194160"," Are you trading 50,000?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6194160","6195160"," Probably not."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6195160","6196160"," Are you trading 5,000?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6196160","6197160"," Probably not."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6197160","6198160"," You're trading 1,000, probably not."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6198160","6199160"," 100 bucks?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6199160","6200160"," I don't know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6200160","6201160"," I don't know."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6201160","6202640"," I don't know what you're trading with me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6202640","6209960"," I know for a fucking fact that on Wednesday, that probably 80% of you did not follow me"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6209960","6210960"," down."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6210960","6216680"," And I know for a fact, 80% of you didn't follow me up into the clothes on Wednesday."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6216680","6220600"," And I know that I've never, I've never, a fact that a ton of you said, I'm taking the"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6220600","6221600"," money here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6221600","6224120"," I know for a fact, somebody took it after we got above the hourly trigger."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6224120","6227760"," So all of you out there have your own trade plans, the point that I'm making."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6227760","6231400"," And all of you out there need to manage your own risk."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6231400","6236320"," So here you can snip this at home, I want you to snip this, snip this at home and watch"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6236320","6237760"," this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6237760","6244800"," So right here, if you were ever going to follow me in a trade, where do you think the best"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6244800","6247520"," chance of you following that trade is?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6247520","6248520"," Right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6248520","6249520"," Right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6249520","6250520"," And why is that?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6250520","6252160"," You've got the initial role here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6252160","6259160"," You've got the confirmation of the cross right here and you've beaten your prior high."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6259160","6267200"," Once you've beaten your prior high, any pullback, and this is trend day, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6267200","6270880"," This could last all day long, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6270880","6273640"," You would take that trade right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6273640","6276000"," Does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6276000","6279640"," A stylist, I need a stylist."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6279640","6280640"," That's true."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6280640","6284040"," Let me clean this up a little bit because this is an important, this is an important lesson"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6284040","6292360"," here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6292360","6299160"," So if you are, I shouldn't say this because it can get me in trouble."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6299160","6303160"," I don't think you should ever follow any of my trades and you don't take trades with"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6303160","6304160"," me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6304160","6306600"," You guys don't trade futures with me in the overnight."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6306600","6308200"," You guys don't always trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6308200","6311640"," You guys, I'm not here sometimes when I close a trade in the morning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6311640","6315000"," You guys aren't here with me at 4.15 if I put a trade on overnight."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6315000","6318040"," Sometimes I'll tell you, hey, I put on some overnight calls or something like that if"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6318040","6319040"," I'm not on stream."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6319040","6323800"," But you guys need your number one, you take your own trades always."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6323800","6328360"," Number two though, if you are going to take a trade with me, I say this all the time but"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6328360","6332400"," I don't always get to show you when I say, ah, yeah, I'm not going to do this or I am"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6332400","6333920"," not going to do that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6333920","6336520"," You are going to see some of these trades."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6336520","6342760"," You'll see somebody say to you something like, um, you get an orange or something, you're"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6342760","6343760"," a yellow."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6343760","6350680"," You'll see see people enter trades on the show right here, they'll enter here, stay"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6350680","6357280"," long and all of this will happen and they'll be screaming, woo hoo, I made all this money."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6357280","6364600"," If it fails here and goes down, they disappear, does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6364600","6366760"," So they'll say to you this here, this is awesome."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6366760","6373760"," And then if it goes against them because they have low percentage wins, right, they'll disappear"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6373760","6377040"," or they'll say, oh, cap, I got fucked up, I'm burning."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6377040","6380400"," So if you're ever going to follow me in a trade here, ever."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6380400","6386800"," So if you see me, if you see me take a risk, you'll hear me in stream say to you, I'm taking"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6386800","6390600"," calls right here but I don't trust what's going to happen."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6390600","6393680"," Do not follow me on that trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6394120","6396120"," Does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6396120","6404440"," If you were ever going to even consider following me on a trade, your entry is here and I'm"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6404440","6408800"," going to make one big statement here right now, okay?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6408800","6416800"," If you follow me or try to copy trade me, which I do not recommend that you do, this"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6416800","6419720"," would be the place right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6419720","6425080"," And I realize you guys are hearing while this is happening, you guys are hearing people"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6425080","6432120"," in the chat screaming and yelling and they're making money and everything is awesome."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6432120","6439440"," So you get excited and you jump in and you roll yourself down over here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6439440","6443320"," So right here is where you take that trade."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6443320","6449920"," Is that work or no?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6449920","6454720"," No, no, that's why I'm writing it."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6454720","6455720"," Yeah, I got you brother."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6455720","6456720"," That's why we're here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6456720","6457720"," This needs to be said, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6457720","6459320"," I think it needs to be said."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6459320","6464480"," So Rick right here, hold on, I'm not joking around there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6464480","6469440"," I mean, clip this at home, like literally clip this right here for I'm going to clip it"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6469440","6470440"," myself."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6471440","6473440"," I'm not going to post this shit right inside the fucking discord."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6473440","6474440"," This is important."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6474440","6475440"," Hold on a second here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6475440","6478440"," I'm with you, Tarky, 100% brother."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6478440","6479440"," I put that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6479440","6480440"," You know what I'll do?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6480440","6481440"," I'm not going to post this in the discord."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6481440","6482440"," I'm looking at it right now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6482440","6490800"," I'm like, I'm not posting this shit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6490800","6496280"," So right here and look what happened right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6496280","6510240"," Let's see what happened right here, right here, right here, right here, right, launch"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6510240","6513120"," right there, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6513120","6514480"," You see it?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6514480","6517720"," Are you above the cross?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6517720","6519400"," Now let's look at this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6519400","6520400"," I want you to look at this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6520400","6524560"," I'm going to leave this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6524560","6525560"," I want you to look at this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6525560","6529200"," I'm going to bring this back up for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6529200","6530200"," I bring that up for you."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6530200","6531200"," Let's see."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6531200","6533240"," I'll put that right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6533240","6534640"," Now I wasn't looking at that chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6534640","6548920"," I couldn't see it was hidden right here, make that smaller right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6548920","6549920"," Now let's look."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6549920","6553600"," Let's examine this right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6553600","6555160"," Where are we in this chart right here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6555160","6558520"," Do you know?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6558520","6562680"," Someone in the chat tell me where we are in this chart."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6562680","6563680"," Are we?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6563680","6565600"," We're right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6565600","6567600"," Watch my cursor."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6567600","6569600"," Oh, shit."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6569600","6572040"," God damn it."

"nSkgrWVD1dU","6578840","6579840"," I guess I got to put this away."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6579840","6580840"," Hold on here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6580840","6581840"," God."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6581840","6582840"," Hold on a second."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6582840","6583840"," Sorry about that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6583840","6584840"," Give me a second."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6585840","6591840"," God, I paint this thing."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6591840","6593840"," Come on now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6593840","6596840"," Come on now."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6596840","6597840"," Right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6597840","6598840"," Let me mute this."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6598840","6601840"," I'm going to mute this just briefly for a second."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6601840","6603840"," Where's the chat?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6603840","6604840"," Get rid of that."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6604840","6605840"," All right."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6605840","6606840"," It's right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6606840","6619720"," Where are we in the course of this chat right here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6619720","6624560"," So we are right here, aren't we, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6624560","6631440"," You see how you've got a 15% chance of a winner here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6631440","6636680"," Right here, you have a 30% chance on the rip right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6636680","6639920"," And what's happening right now, do we have the cross yet?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6639920","6640920"," No."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6640920","6644040"," So that's a 30% winner right here, isn't it?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6644040","6645760"," That's a 30% winner right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6645760","6650520"," Now, for me personally, I'm going to tell you that that's a liquidation break, but so when"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6650520","6656120"," I'm on stream and I say to you, hey, I'm going to set a trade up right there."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6656120","6657440"," And we're like right about here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6657440","6659480"," I'm going to set a trade up right in here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6659480","6661840"," What am I looking for to enter that trade?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6661840","6664840"," This one right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6664840","6665840"," Or this one right here."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6666320","6668240"," So are we there right now?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6668240","6669240"," No, are we?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6669240","6671640"," We're not there right now, are we?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6671640","6673640"," So let's see how this trade plays itself up."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6673640","6676520"," So what are you looking for?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6676520","6679360"," We're not there yet."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6679360","6685360"," I think this actually recovers, but you're looking for to beat this prior high right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6685360","6687920"," We haven't done that yet, have we?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6687920","6690120"," Remember I talked about that just a minute ago?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6690120","6694800"," You want to see the breaking of the prior high"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6694880","6699000"," and then breaking this one right here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6699000","6704040"," You take that one long, but of course, if I'm taking risk here or if I'm taking risk"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6704040","6711840"," here, right, I'm taking risk right here on known buyers, you have to get out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6711840","6714000"," You have to get out."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6714000","6718520"," And then if you're taking this long for this and you get trapped, what are you doing here?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6718520","6720680"," Talk about this all the time too, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6720680","6724920"," I took this one, this has a 30% chance of a win, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6724920","6729840"," If this blasts down on you, what do I say to you in the show?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6729840","6733880"," If it goes against you, what do I say to you?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6733880","6744760"," If your stops are here, you execute the stop up here, right?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6744760","6750800"," And then you reposition yourself, whether we go higher or roll down, breather a short"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6750800","6751800"," or an upside move."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6751800","6753800"," Does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6753800","6758720"," Let me go back, we'll open up the chat again, so not open, but let me get the chat going"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6758720","6761720"," so I can read what you guys are saying."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6761720","6771080"," I bring the chat up, sorry, let me get some water in me."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6771080","6787160"," Say something in the chat so I can get the chat rolling here, there we go."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6787160","6795240"," All right, I can see, that's good, that's good, something, that's good, that's good, it's"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6795240","6796240"," going."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6796240","6807160"," Okay, so dissecting, dissecting that, is any of that clear or unclear, first question."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6807160","6814880"," Second question is, the second question would be, or do you want me to, I just clipped it,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6814880","6823000"," I'm going to save it, and what I'll do is I'll make it cleaner, I'll make it look better."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6823000","6831720"," I did a, on the, on YouTube, I have a video about this, yeah, so I have a video about"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6831720","6838080"," this on YouTube, where you can watch it right through step by step."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6838080","6850160"," Yeah, I agree with that, I agree with that 100%, let me just save this really quick, because"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6850160","6856880"," I'll post this chart or pin it in the discord, okay, so that's good, so, and this is going"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6856880","6862080"," to be the last part of this conversation, this is the most important part of this conversation."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6862080","6867920"," This is the critical part, I think maybe this is what Turkey McNugget is getting to."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6867920","6873880"," When you are watching these trades, right, you are assuming that risk, you are assuming"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6873880","6878160"," the risk of a 15% chance of a win."
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6878160","6883680"," So if you are going in with 10 contracts, I don't know what that 10 contracts is for"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6883680","6892200"," you, is it 0.1% of your account, is it 0.5, are you adding as we go up, we are on a trend"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6892200","6896400"," day, and we are going all the way up and up and up, and you are adding like hundreds of"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6896400","6904560"," contracts, you are making 20 grand, 30 grand, 50 grand, or are you doubling down, are you"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6904560","6911960"," making 50,000 on a Wednesday, and then coming back and trading 300 bucks, or are you taking"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6911960","6914720"," that 50 grand and going in 100 grand?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6914720","6925360"," I don't know what you are doing, so I don't know what to say to that, cool, I will make"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6925360","6938640"," a post in Discord today, let me write this down, I will make a post in Discord today"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6938640","6947680"," with that, now I want to show you guys one other thing, this is the last one, why not"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6947680","6953640"," just take the 70% trades on stream, I do, I take them on stream all the time, I took"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6953640","6957000"," them on Wednesday, I took two big ones, you guys didn't, or some of you followed, some"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6957000","6966680"," of you didn't, is it dumb, okay here is another good question, James Valdez is asking a question,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6966680","6971720"," that is very important, you can actually buy, I don't know how much money you guys have,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6971720","6978400"," so James Valdez, if you have money, if you have actual money right, the better way to"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6978400","6987560"," trade this would be to buy, spy, you actually buy the spy, are you ready, I will show you"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6987560","6992520"," the best way to trade this, you want to know the best way to trade this, the best way to"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","6992520","7001880"," trade this system is, you buy the spy right here, you literally buy 100 contracts, you"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7001880","7009680"," never sell those contracts, you understand that, you never sell them, and you short every"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7009680","7015640"," time you're underneath the five minute trigger, you close your short, and you buy more spy"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7015640","7023080"," contracts right there, but I don't know what your count size is, so you would buy the spy,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7023080","7035920"," and then you short it, but I don't know what you guys don't have that ability, and you can"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7035920","7040600"," do this on every time frame, you can do this on, let me show you a different time frame here,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7040600","7046840"," so let me give you another one here, so let me give you an hour time frame, do we have some"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7046840","7056240"," good fucking shit here, so let me show you a different time frame, let's look at an hour"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7056240","7066320"," time frame, it's a one hour time frame right, it's a very similar thing isn't it, so you've"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7066320","7070920"," got the, you've got the, well I'm gonna drop down me, and I'm gonna, that's not gonna do it well,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7070920","7083160"," yeah it doesn't work either, so if you're here to copy trade and make money and not learn how to"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7083160","7088320"," trade right, we can do something here if you want, we can do it, we can make a vote of it,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7088320","7093560"," because last night I was in a, last night I made a market brief, on the, on the market brief last"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7093640","7100640"," night I told you in the market brief last night that next week we're going to switch to, from"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7100640","7108160"," zero dates to a slower trade, so let me show you this here, so you've got the, you've got the"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7108160","7114760"," cross right here, do you see it, you have the back test right here, do you see it, and then you"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7114760","7122480"," have sustained upward price movement, do you see it, you got that right there, if this was a one"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7122560","7128600"," minute chart it would be the exact same structure, does that make sense, do you see how your win"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7128600","7135840"," rate goes higher, so in last night's market brief at the end of it I said to traders, I said next"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7135840","7146120"," week in particular we're gonna switch to, we're gonna switch to a slower trade, so next week when"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7146120","7151080"," we come into next week right, we might take one or two trades, maybe three, four, maybe three"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7151080","7155560"," or four, but I doubt it, I think it's gonna be like one or two trades next week, and in that"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7155560","7161600"," market brief last night I said to you, we're gonna focus more next week on things that you're"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7161600","7167080"," interested in, trading styles that you're interested in, all that kind of stuff, tickers that you're"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7167080","7172360"," in, I think I said ticker symbols and strategies that you're interested in, and I said in that"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7172360","7180360"," market brief you're gonna be looking for outsized moves to trade, so for next week in particular"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7180360","7187400"," we're gonna switch to a chart like this, and when we do we'll put a trade on, right, we'll put a trade"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7187400","7193960"," on, and we're just gonna watch it for like a week, three days, four days, five days, we're not gonna"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7193960","7200360"," trade in two days, zero dates, and we're gonna do two quick things when we do that, okay, it's gonna"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7200440","7208360"," be a fascinating, it's gonna be a fascinating experiment, we're gonna put on a trade and watch"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7208360","7214200"," it, right, we're gonna watch it, just do its thing, and then we're gonna pop busy ourselves with"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7214200","7223320"," other things, and I want to see what your thoughts are on that live stream, it's gonna be all week"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7223320","7228760"," long, and I want to see what your thoughts are on that live stream, and the reason for that is"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7228760","7235880"," because this live stream in particular involves a lot of traders that don't trade all the time,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7236440","7242120"," and they come in and they go throughout the day, and so they're looking for hey I'm taking along"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7242120","7246440"," here, I'm taking a short here, just want to see what you guys are doing, and then they disappear,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7247800","7251000"," so next week if you have the market brief you can read it, it's at the bottom,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7252120","7257400"," we're gonna sit here next week, and I'm fascinated to see what the reaction is from the"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7257400","7262600"," audience to that, because we're gonna be discussing a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do except"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7262600","7265800"," for that trade, does that make sense?"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7272600","7277800"," Yeah, so Uncle JPG is asking that, if you're a part of the discord, or if you're a member,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7277800","7281960"," supporter, we're gonna place one or two trades next week, we're just gonna sit here and watch"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7281960","7286600"," the trade work, that's it, that's all we're gonna do, we're just gonna sit in it all week long,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7286600","7292440"," and then we're just gonna talk about a bunch of other shit, and I'm interested to see how it goes,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7292440","7297400"," because I think I'm not positive how it goes, I think a bunch of people are gonna show up like"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7297400","7301560"," what the fuck are you guys doing in here, we're just gonna watch this trade go,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7304520","7308520"," are you going to post a live price of said trade, I remember you wanted to do that with"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7308520","7314280"," long spread strategies, yeah I was advised not to do it, I was told that I could be held liable"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7315160","7323400"," for financial advice, and that's, I was told not to do that program, I was advised by my"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7323400","7333240"," attorneys not to do that on public with you, yeah like a family, absolutely, hold on here,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7336440","7343000"," I was advised not to, do you know the reason why, because you'll say Captain Jim James told me to do"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7343000","7350760"," this, how can I access the discord, okay so discord, let's go back over here, let's go to one minute chart,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7356840","7362280"," and here's the other thing, I should have wrote, I'll put this on the post, so when I write,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7362280","7369000"," when I draw these out for you, so see this right here, when I draw these out for you, do you know"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7369000","7373320"," why I draw these out for you, I said this earlier in the week too, but we're gonna highlight it"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7373320","7386040"," briefly right now, so this is not a projection, this is are we breaking above or below resistance,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7386040","7393160"," so when I put, see this right here, and when I put this up here, why am I putting this up here,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7393160","7401480"," do you know why, I want to see if price goes there to indicate to me if we're strong or not,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7402600","7413480"," so if we fail this or do we go above it, and both, both tell me a piece of information,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7414200","7421160"," are the buyers strong or are the buyers weak, if the buyers are strong you will take out this prior,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7423480","7431000"," this pivot point right here, if they're strong you'll go above it, and you know that that next"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7431000","7437960"," trade is going to be powerful, these buyers right here have lots of strength, does that make sense,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7437960","7445560"," and then you take that trade and boom you're off and running, so are buyers strong here right now"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7445560","7449400"," or not, right, I thought we were coming back up, right I said to you, I think this is gonna give"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7449400","7456680"," us a way to go up, it didn't, but what else did this offer for you, a way out, so if you're buying"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7456680","7464120"," this dip on a 30% win, and we go down, and we come back up before we start heading down,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7464760","7471960"," you even have an easy exit right here, do you see that, there's like an exit for you, right there,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7471960","7486280"," go up here, down, and I think we're gonna go like this, straight down there,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7486280","7502120"," right there, let's watch that right there,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7509640","7514200"," it's helping you to see them as a probability and not direct projection,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7514200","7520840"," yeah I'm trying to, what I'm trying to do for you is give you in my brain what I'm seeing,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7520840","7526520"," so when I trade I don't actually draw this shit, I just look at it and go, I got a fucking 30%"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7526520","7531480"," chance of winning this fucking trade, I got a 15% chance of winning this trade, I got a 70%"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7531480","7537400"," chance of winning this trade, if I put 10 contracts on at 10% or 10% win it starts turning up,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7538040","7543960"," I'll put 20 contracts on, if it turns into 45% I'll put 30 contracts on, if it turns then it turns"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7543960","7549720"," into a 70% win rate, I'm over here fucking hammer in the buy button, 300 contracts, let's do it,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7551160","7556200"," and as we begin to roll the same thing, start taking the contracts off and then I start to"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7556200","7566120"," deleverage myself to runners, am I buying puts on this next confirmation of retest one, no my"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7566120","7571000"," account is down right now, I tried to buy calls or set up calls and I came and set them up,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7571880","7576280"," my tasty works is not working, I've reset it twice now at this point,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","7578280","7583320"," need to need to close on tessel over 163 and could get a $3.7 pump,"

"nSkgrWVD1dU","8105640","8112520"," all right, hold on, let's go back to this"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8118280","8122600"," let's watch this play out together, oh hold on"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8127800","8130520"," let me make this one red, we'll put doom on this one"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8131480","8137240"," right there and right there, we got the biggie, you need to make a note of this fucking video dude"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8138920","8147560"," let's see what happens, and where is the trade dead here, if this trade reverses, where is it"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8149400","8156040"," and this, you know what sucks about this too is this is bears, like sellers don't get these"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8156040","8163960"," moves like buyers do, or sustained moves like this, so where do sellers lose here right,"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8163960","8168040"," because if we're looking at this from the perspective of flattening out of the one in five minutes"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8168040","8172680"," it's like I'm actually kind of bullish here, now what do we need to know about this if we are bullish"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8173960","8176040"," wait a minute, hold on I'm gonna get rid of this so you can see it"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8178440","8185080"," so see this prior high right here, so I can draw this out, if I was gonna do risk management"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8187000","8193720"," right, I would go right from here, I would say if we got a new high, if we got a new high"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8196600","8202760"," right, be looking for this, I think put this, that and then that right there"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8204280","8211000"," in my brain I would be going right there, see it, get the new high, back down"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8211880","8219160"," I'd be watching for this right here, back up that way"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8221560","8228120"," and something like this right here, that's kind of fucked up looking but you get the gist"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8230200","8234120"," does that make sense, so my stops are going to be"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8234840","8244360"," if I think about that in my brain right, if I think about my brain I'm gonna write"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8245000","8249720"," in my brain I'm gonna say my stops are right here, stops on being short right here"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8256520","8258440"," I'm gonna execute the stop though"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8264440","8268440"," right here"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8277320","8283320"," so your stops right here, it goes against you, execute the stop right here, you got it"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8284040","8290280"," that's right here"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8299240","8300840"," and see, you can see it"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8313320","8333960"," so there we go right there, let's see what happens"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","8343880","8354520"," you might get one more tick up here, you might move up, I missed this one right here, you might get one more here"

"nSkgrWVD1dU","9107360","9109360"," We're not going up anymore"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","9109360","9111360"," So let's look at this and see how this plays out"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","9111360","9113360"," Oh I'm still pretty"
"nSkgrWVD1dU","9113360","9115360"," I'm still pretty good here though"
