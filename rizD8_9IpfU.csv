"19660","22320"," I would no need to have it that hard."
"24640","25240"," Look at that. "
"26100","29920"," I think that's the plan."
"30060","31380"," That's why I must be doing is turning it down."
"34180","35140"," Good morning HP. "

"39320","39780"," Good morning brand."
"41720","44080"," Yeah, PPI is hot."
"45140","47320"," Not having that much reaction at this moment. "
"49260","52720"," There's a couple of other numbers that came out that might help mark it up a little bit."
"53120","53800"," Good morning GP."

"66220","67400"," Right on, right on. "
"71010","72090"," Everybody's doing well this morning."
"74890","76570"," Top of the morning to you Corey."
"78270","79610"," Get everybody in here this morning. "
"79710","80230"," We got a lot too over."
"80890","83110"," I didn't start early on Sunday or Monday."
"83110","89270"," I had a long Sunday and then Monday morning I had to do some stuff with my children for Valentine's"
"89270","89750"," Day. "
"91010","92470"," So today we're going to go through that stuff."
"92730","94030"," HP good to see you."
"94210","95410"," San good to see you endless research. "
"96810","97430"," Good to see you."
"98130","99990"," You got to get some other numbers all over those."
"101530","103250"," Low feet good to see you. "
"103650","105030"," Good morning West Boyford."
"105190","105450"," How are you?"
"105630","113090"," Good to see you brother."
"114770","115730"," Oh boy. "
"116270","117590"," Good morning Mr. Brown."
"118650","119950"," Where's our guy from yesterday?"
"120450","121190"," Is he showing up today?"
"121290","122350"," The Jimmy Jim James guy?"
"122970","123450"," Where's he?"
"125670","127130"," Is this shit on fire this morning?"
"128289","128289"," Probably."
"131090","132210"," I can't win. "
"133130","135270"," I don't think any of us can win right now."
"136390","137570"," We'll go over actually."
"139330","140390"," Good morning Dio. "
"140610","141650"," We're going to go over to."
"143490","148590"," We're going to go over to why we took, why would take spread yesterday to."
"149050","150430"," We're going to talk about everything this morning. "
"150570","151990"," It actually takes a good example."
"153790","155110"," Yeah, PPI was hot."
"156010","157590"," Damien, Damien, how you doing brother?"
"157990","159390"," Did you trust me?"
"159390","159930"," What did you do?"
"159970","160970"," Close your shorts perfectly. "
"161490","162850"," Buy some lungs into the today."
"163370","164570"," Is that what you did this morning?"
"166870","168490"," We're going to address that right now."
"172710","174190"," Hold on here in this morning. "
"181190","182250"," Is he here?"
"182250","185830"," Oh, yeah."
"186470","187030"," There he goes."
"188130","188570"," Okay. "
"195210","195650"," Damn."
"197090","199570"," That was quick as quick as quick as could be."
"204370","205030"," All right. "
"205130","205490"," Here we go."
"205610","206350"," We got everybody, right?"
"207230","208230"," There we go."
"208970","209630"," All right. "
"209850","210710"," So this is what we're going to do."
"210790","211030"," Okay."
"212090","213750"," We're going to have a little conversation this morning. "
"214770","219050"," And the first we're the conversation that we're going to have this morning."
"219950","221330"," Turn that off right there."
"224330","224990"," All right. "
"225290","226410"," Everybody's doing well this morning."
"226690","226850"," All right."
"226910","231810"," We're going to have a conversation because this is the second time that we've had people in stream,"
"232090","232150"," right?"
"232590","235550"," And we're going to talk about something real quick. "
"235550","236350"," Take two seconds."
"237250","241410"," If you want to trade your day and not follow along this channel, go follow somebody else or do your"
"241410","241850"," own thing alone."
"241850","248390"," If you're going to come into the channel and impact the thoughts on our trading days here, I'm"
"248390","249050"," trying to make money. "
"249190","253630"," Other people here are trying to make money and we don't need you."
"254010","254990"," You know, that's the point."
"255050","256810"," If you got to be constructive, be constructive. "
"257110","259209"," And I want you to be constructive and offer different viewpoints."
"260209","264330"," But if you're going to come in, poison a stream, stuff like that, you can get jacked in this"
"264330","264550"," market."
"264970","267510"," And this morning is a prime example of that. "
"268890","274730"," I'm getting jacked in exactly getting jacked inside of the market and just having one overwhelming"
"274730","275930"," viewpoint on the market."
"276230","279110"," So the bandhammer is just out for that kind of stuff."
"279230","283090"," Anything that's like just straight nonsense, you're going to get instant bandhammer at this point. "
"283230","284690"," Anybody that's like constructive, I'm good with that."
"285290","286290"," You can trade against me."
"286390","287010"," You can trade with me. "
"287010","288070"," You can disagree too."
"288610","292070"," But if you're just going to come in and speak nonsense the morning shit like that, you're going to"
"292070","292630"," get fucking banned."
"293170","297490"," And that's the end of it. "
"297490","301310"," Because we traded higher overnight, which is a big move, right?"
"301430","309270"," We had shorts come off in the overnight based upon news that maybe Russia is pulling back its"
"309270","309570"," troops."
"310150","313430"," That's the predicate for why the markets went up."
"313930","319150"," I also checked CNN this morning and they were basing it upon something completely fucking"
"319150","322870"," different, not at all on the Russian news. "
"322870","328710"," I don't know if that's because they're trying to sell the Russia fair campaign or fair story, but"
"328710","332770"," it is shocking to see how different news organizations preface."
"332990","338350"," And this is funny because CNN was talking about the markets this morning specifically and was"
"338350","342410"," unwilling to give credit to whether the Russian news is good currently."
"344470","347530"," So that's as quickly as it is, right?"
"347530","349610"," Yeah, absolutely, right, boyfriend. "
"349990","351430"," There's like just no more nonsense."
"351550","352450"," I can't have it in the morning."
"354010","354790"," Can't have it. "
"355390","356150"," Can't have it."
"357490","359050"," You know, there's another thing too."
"359490","364030"," There's anyway, I'll talk about that later, but I just can't have it because what happens is it"
"364030","364810"," poisons the stream. "
"364830","365570"," It poisons me."
"366190","369930"," It poisons what I'm thinking about trying to trade in this market."
"371010","374250"," And I mean, that's the basic basicness of it, right?"
"374250","378170"," When you're poisoning the thought process and the rest of the week, I know there are people"
"378170","383410"," yesterday that a weekly calls that got paranoid and cut them loose from what went on in the stream"
"383410","385910"," earlier yesterday and cost people a lot of money. "
"386650","387790"," So that's the concern."
"388110","394690"," We're going to talk about, we're going to talk about, we're going to, yeah, the tell was Russian"
"394690","395210"," ending drills."
"396190","397230"," Supposedly, they're still there. "
"397390","398270"," Supposedly, they still haven't left."
"398430","402150"," And another thing too, we're going to talk about the stuff that I posted yesterday about how to"
"402150","404450"," take short positions, right?"
"404590","405990"," Now this can be long and puts too."
"406430","411670"," But when you're taking a short position that you put on put spreads, right, in the money, put some"
"411670","415330"," time on them, we can trade it down or up as it rolls over. "
"415870","421070"," And we can also trade it up higher, right, with zero dates, one dates, weeklies, whatever."
"421990","423390"," And today's a prime example."
"423830","430310"," So if we traded it down yesterday into four, three, five, zero, and then we traded it, oh, I stayed"
"430310","430630"," flat. "
"430810","432110"," I didn't take anything in the bell yesterday."
"432670","435630"," I couldn't decipher if we were going up or down overnight."
"436510","442290"," But the key being is that the key about this is that this market can switch on you in a"
"442290","442590"," second. "
"443030","447290"," So if someone's saying to you, you know, just bear, bear, bear, or just bull, bull, bull."
"448290","449430"," Now this market's going to fuck you up."
"449730","451630"," There's no way around it right now. "
"451690","452690"," It's just what it is."
"453590","455010"," It's just what it is."
"457230","457630"," Scam. "
"458270","459770"," It is a scam."
"460010","463110"," The news is a scam right now, 100 fucking percent."
"463650","464790"," So we're going to move into some stuff. "
"464930","465750"," It's 840 right now."
"466170","467390"," I hope you guys are all having a great morning."
"467690","470290"," Any of you that went long into the close yesterday, congratulations. "
"471650","473450"," You should have a nice fat pay this morning."
"474850","476170"," We'll go over the numbers too."
"476250","482170"," I think some of the numbers were good, relevant to COVID bad numbers that we had. "
"483370","483810"," Yeah."
"484190","489550"," So if any of you guys have any calls into today, congratulations."
"490630","491890"," So I want to let you guys know that. "
"494060","494500"," Yeah."
"494640","501040"," So we're going to talk about how we structure our protective puts, how we trade the market up and"
"501040","503620"," when it rolls over again this morning."
"503960","507500"," We're going to do some charting together so that we can look at some. "
"508220","510300"," So we're going to look at some stuff here."
"510860","514620"," So first, let's take a look at earning whispers, right?"
"516039","519620"," We've got this morning today is the 15th, right?"
"520020","522100"," So today's Tuesday we have Mary at this morning."
"522799","527300"," We have Roblox today, so we'll keep an eye out on Roblox. "
"527440","529260"," They will look at hip or a quick map on that."
"529680","530300"," We'll look at Airbnb."
"531000","531980"," This is for today, right?"
"532160","532180"," Yeah. "
"532280","533260"," We got Airbnb today."
"533680","534500"," So we'll check them out."
"534940","536140"," I'm interested in Viacom. "
"536280","536820"," They're up this morning."
"537340","538680"," Then we've got Shopify."
"538820","540580"," I know that your wife's boyfriend's interest in that trade. "
"541060","543440"," We got Crocs on the open tomorrow as well."
"544100","547440"," Wix, Wix did really well during COVID."
"547520","549700"," I guess people started a bunch of online businesses and stuff. "
"549980","553900"," We've got AMC networks, then Nvidia, some heavy rockers this week, right?"
"554420","560080"," We've got Palantere, Roku, we got Sunrun that I'm in as well personally."
"560080","567000"," So the next few days shouldn't be exactly selling the market just for the interest in some of these"
"567000","568600"," larger companies that are rolling through."
"568960","575240"," Cisco's a big company rolling through Quantum Escape, Matterport, Marathon Oil, DoorDash, Fastly. "
"575560","579960"," There's a whole list of companies, Generac, Craft Hines."
"580480","581820"," These are companies Walmart."
"582320","583860"," They at least hold the market up, right?"
"584360","585460"," Dropbox, Yeti. "
"586440","587880"," So these companies hold the market up."
"587880","589460"," The market should stay up."
"589580","592200"," We've got John Deere on Friday as well. "
"592560","595880"," So we've got some heavy hitters in there that should."
"596240","599980"," Oh, the Russians did what they said they were going to do, and not all the crap speculative by the"
"599980","601600"," U.S. government media is shocking exactly."
"602320","604380"," The crazy part too is in the Russian news. "
"604700","605220"," They haven't left."
"606280","610880"," They've just gone back to their bases right where they are."
"611340","615880"," So they were trading in a, it's called FTX or something like that, right?"
"616000","620700"," A field training exercises, and they went straight back to their staging ground. "
"620840","621640"," So they haven't left the area."
"622180","624260"," Everything right now, in my view, is a scam."
"624500","629900"," At any moment, they could just bring on more bad Russian news and use it as an excuse to drop"
"629900","630300"," the market. "
"631420","632580"," So we've got that this morning."
"633060","635240"," Economic news, you guys already know about some of this stuff."
"635240","639520"," We had to produce a price index for an empire state manufacturing index. "
"639800","648140"," We do have some more volatility tomorrow on Wednesday with retail sales, import price index."
"648560","649620"," Talked about that yesterday."
"650140","651720"," We've got claims, continuing claims on Thursday. "
"652620","658120"," Now, for today, I want to go over real quick on the, let me see."
"658120","663540"," The February Empire Manufacturing Index, right?"
"663620","670300"," It's 3.1 versus 12.0. New orders, 1.4 versus minus 5.0 prior."
"671420","674800"," New shipments, 2.9 versus 1.0 prior. "
"675380","678880"," Prices paid, 76.6 versus 76.7 prior, not too bad."
"679560","682800"," Employment plus 23.1 versus 16.1 prior."
"683680","688220"," This is a good one because these numbers were jacked up during COVID. "
"688680","693160"," So that might be, might be used as an excuse to be holding up the market, even though we had"
"693160","695480"," hot, hot data this morning."
"696220","699180"," Let me see the, let me see the PPI numbers here."
"703450","704690"," See if I can get the rest of that. "
"704810","706710"," I'm not getting that information right now for some reason."
"706710","707390"," I don't know why."
"707770","709590"," But those did come in slightly hot today. "
"710150","715170"," Let me see, expected at 8.30. I'm not showing the actual numbers here."
"715670","722770"," But we can see it here that the PPI, the actual was 1.5% in the, in the median"
"722770","725730"," forecast, only 0.5. That's pretty freaking hot, right?"
"726270","727490"," That's not a good number."
"728190","730250"," But we'll see how that impacts today. "
"730610","731530"," I don't think it's going to impact too much."
"731530","733950"," We'll get a dip and then a dip to a buy."
"735330","738430"," Next thing we're going to go to is the spot cam report for this morning. "
"738890","741870"," We've got a futures of rallied sharply to 4456 on news."
"741870","743950"," That Russia is returning some troops."
"744450","747230"," Well, we aren't qualified to comment on geopolitical events. "
"747830","752370"," We would state the headlines like matter more when gamut is sharply negative, right?"
"752730","753810"," That's the key this morning."
"753870","756470"," And that's the key that Winky was saying, right?"
"757850","762030"," The headlines are mattering more than the actual truth is what's going on."
"762290","764190"," We don't know if they're actually invading or not. "
"764490","765830"," We know that they haven't left."
"766010","768750"," They haven't put any of their tanks on any trains to ship them out."
"768750","775170"," We know that there's other evidence out there stating something completely different than the"
"775170","776650"," Russians have wrapped up their exercises. "
"777690","783270"," Also this morning, there is still, I was looking on the, I was looking at a map that does real "
"783270","791330","-time flight information on a map, and there's still no flights over Belarus, a nice portion of"
"791330","796270"," Russia on the border of Ukraine, and there's minimal flights still in Ukraine this morning."
"796270","797630"," So nothing's really changed."
"798150","804230"," All the flight patterns are still circling that area currently, so no one's truly bought that story"
"804230","804850"," at this point. "
"805670","813150"," On that, though, our volatility estimate is in line with yesterday's 1.3%. One standard deviation"
"813150","820270"," move open to close resistance is still at 4500, right?"
"820270","822590"," So 4500 and 4520."
"823250","824470"," I believe 4520."
"825630","835390"," Actually, you know, 4520 actually lies outside of that consolidation zone between 450 and"
"835390","836590"," 400. "
"838730","842170"," To boilize it, 4450 and 44400."
"842270","843510"," We'll chart this out."
"843670","844690"," We're going to chart this all out. "
"845270","846350"," I'm going to show you guys how I chart."
"846590","847750"," I do this at least once a week."
"847750","852370"," I do this so you guys can see how I build my week out for how I trade the week,"
"852390","855250"," and then we wind up with book map. "
"855470","858670"," And someone we had a comment yesterday saying, I don't think book map works."
"859410","865170"," So I don't think that that person tunes in, at least on Mondays or Sundays, when we go through how"
"865170","867810"," we plot out our week, or at least how I plot out my week."
"868710","870050"," So we're going to go through that this morning. "
"870670","878790"," The current gamma buildup seems heaviest at 440 on spy, 4400 on SPX and 450 on spy."
"879270","884130"," In this range, the market is quite fluid and driven by negative gamma, Vanna flows."
"884790","891470"," So if it's driven by negative gamma and Vanna flows, that means anything that's not normally"
"891470","892030"," trading the news. "
"892190","895690"," Right now we're trading the news because of negative gamma and Vanna flows, right?"
"895990","899710"," Anything that anybody fucking fights in this market is going down."
"900250","903990"," Any kind of scrap of fucking good news, market is going up, right?"
"904190","904810"," Doesn't even have to be true."
"905270","908130"," This has to be something thrown out there in the news because there is no good news. "
"908270","911210"," There is no really good news out there for the market."
"911570","917490"," So they'll take anything and there's so much bad news that any time anything comes out that's"
"917490","920390"," horrifying that we already know about, the market's going to dump with that as well."
"921170","925930"," While the headline was enough to enter the slipstream higher, a reversal back down is just as easy. "
"926910","929410"," Keep that in note as we trade today."
"929770","932950"," Okay, I want to keep this part of the note as we trade today."
"933510","937750"," However, as we approach Friday's OPEC, we think that the trading range tightened back down around"
"937750","943830"," the 4500 area through tomorrow and extended rally fueled by declining implied volatility and put"
"943830","950510"," the cake, pushed the market back up into the 55204550 area, which is where we noted heavy"
"950510","951590"," resistance last week. "
"951990","959530"," Currently a measure of equal or less to 25% of SPI SPX QQ gamma expiring, which removes some of"
"959530","961270"," the net negative gamma into Monday."
"962110","966730"," As this is a put heavy expiration, the decay and closing these puts could keep a tailwind and"
"966730","973190"," market through Friday, but it does not remove some lower bound support currently seen at 4375."
"973190","978170"," So we'll write that one down to 4370 into the end of the month. "
"979270","982210"," But now that I think that key is OPEC, right?"
"982790","985150"," 4370, keep that number in mind."
"985530","987850"," Recall this lower bound area idea."
"988310","992610"," Found idea is that essentially markets are currently too well hedged to have a material decline. "
"993910","998470"," And so the point being behind this is that market is completely hedged or it's becoming hedged and"
"998470","1000850"," unless we get huge more put buying."
"1001190","1003810"," And as a matter of fact, yesterday's PM note noted this."
"1004770","1006670"," They won't have too much material decline. "
"1007090","1013170"," I won't bring that now, but anybody read yesterday's PM note from SPOT gamma."
"1013210","1019230"," It noted exactly what we talked about in the stream yesterday, which was that this is the same"
"1019230","1021090"," thing that this is what they're doing every single time."
"1021270","1022950"," We trade up, right?"
"1023089","1024510"," And everybody's loading up on put spreads. "
"1024890","1026490"," They're buying put spreads in the way up."
"1026490","1028690"," And then they're cashing them in on the way back down."
"1028930","1031310"," And then they're loading them up at every level on the way back up. "
"1031490","1035050"," If anybody out there has a SPOT gamma subscription, you can check yesterday's PM note."
"1035310","1041270"," It actually details exactly the same trading system that we're using here on this channel."
"1041970","1042410"," Sorry. "
"1042530","1048010"," So moving on from that, we'll recall this, but it does seem to remove some lower bound support."
"1048530","1049610"," Apparently seen at 4370."
"1050350","1053150"," We're too well hedged to have a material decline. "
"1055110","1057610"," I'll scroll through these levels slowly for you."
"1057770","1063150"," So if you want to ever pause this video, come back and check the support and resistance levels for"
"1063150","1064810"," the major, major indexes."
"1064810","1065850"," You're more than welcome to. "
"1067110","1069530"," You can also check these gamma charts out."
"1070010","1072590"," And we'll move on from here at this point."
"1072730","1075310"," And we're going to move right into ES. "
"1075630","1078950"," We'll chart ES today because this is one thing."
"1078970","1084550"," What you guys to know is sometimes when you chart ES, it doesn't transfer well over to the spy."
"1084890","1088990"," If you're trading the spy specifically, it won't always transfer well. "
"1089150","1093730"," Let's say you're charting the spy and you break through one of your support areas or resistance"
"1093730","1094650"," zones."
"1095110","1097190"," Why did we break through when I charted this perfectly?"
"1097890","1102930"," It's because the charting on ES is a little bit wider due to the ranges that are traded in the"
"1102930","1106770"," after hours and the overnight, or not the after hours, the overnight specifically."
"1107610","1108990"," So we'll get rid of this right here. "
"1109430","1112150"," And we're just going to look at the S&P chart this morning."
"1113730","1117390"," Let's take a look at this on a three month, right?"
"1118570","1120770"," We'll just start here in this three month over here."
"1123290","1126990"," And this is whenever we're talking about that negative channel that..."
"1127850","1131670"," Remember we're talking about this downward sloping channel, right?"
"1131850","1133230"," This is the one that we're talking about. "
"1133730","1137830"," This is the major channel that we're always talking about saying, hey, you know that channel we"
"1137830","1139430"," have to break out of, right?"
"1139910","1140730"," We sold off here."
"1140910","1141470"," We tried again."
"1141670","1142230"," We tried again. "
"1142330","1143490"," We sold off down here."
"1143850","1144390"," We tried again."
"1144990","1147950"," We traded it above it and we said, hey, we're neutral now, right?"
"1148150","1150750"," This is all negative, believe it or not. "
"1151270","1153450"," This right here is neutral."
"1154350","1156690"," And if we start to trade higher, that's when we become positive."
"1156930","1158810"," This is when we become actually bullish. "
"1160330","1166550"," Okay, so I want you guys to realize this level here and know that anything below this is still a"
"1166550","1167690"," negative connotation, right?"
"1167830","1169770"," We have to understand that that's still a negative connotation."
"1170490","1175530"," We know that we have this lower level here on 24th we hit."
"1178610","1181430"," And as we traded up here, we broke through. "
"1182150","1184010"," I believe this was Sunday into Monday."
"1185070","1186970"," Could be wrong and I believe that this was Sunday."
"1187750","1189510"," And then this was the touch on Monday. "
"1190850","1193270"," Then we rechecked it against in cash market."
"1193430","1194130"," This is cash market."
"1194130","1198470"," I believe this was 4 a.m. It could be wrong on this, but this is some at some point"
"1198470","1201550"," early in the morning on Monday right here, right?"
"1201890","1208010"," We traded back up and we've also had a squeeze higher into this zone above, right?"
"1208470","1213490"," So we know below we talked about yesterday, I said to you, we can't trade below. "
"1214350","1215110"," See here."
"1216290","1217310"," We'll bring this lower."
"1218450","1222410"," I said to you, we can't trade below this 45-0, right?"
"1222410","1224250"," I told you yesterday. "
"1226430","1229810"," See if we're 43-5-0, right here."
"1230730","1232650"," So yes, we can't trade below this."
"1232790","1235330"," Now we can trade below this briefly, right?"
"1235470","1237490"," We can trade below here and swing back up. "
"1237750","1239890"," But if we trade below this number, right?"
"1240590","1242710"," And start to sit here, right?"
"1242850","1245670"," This is where you confirm a lower prices, okay?"
"1246710","1251070"," So that's my point behind you when I talk to you about we can't trade below this number."
"1251390","1253490"," Why it's so critical we don't trade below there."
"1253490","1259530"," And we know this looking at book map every day that this is a support level of support. "
"1259710","1260890"," We almost broke through it yesterday."
"1262150","1263710"," We don't want to break through this."
"1263790","1268810"," If we break through this, we are definitely retesting this 4-2-1-3. "
"1269210","1273070"," Call it 420 and possibly even testing lower, right?"
"1273170","1274810"," We shouldn't have to come back down here to test."
"1275410","1278590"," And if we do end up coming back down here to test, we break through this level."
"1279150","1280810"," There's your 400, there's your 390. "
"1281650","1285770"," We've had one, two, three, four rejections up here, right?"
"1286250","1287370"," So we know all about that."
"1287890","1290350"," We're going to also look at that 4,400 level."
"1290890","1293210"," We talked, or Spock M has been talking about, right?"
"1293650","1297230"," We came back down, tested this, traded sideways and down. "
"1297930","1301030"," We know that this is becoming support down here at 4,400."
"1303340","1304760"," Make this slightly higher."
"1312480","1315220"," We've got some discussions going on. "
"1316120","1317740"," 43.82 down here."
"1318560","1320800"," Look at this one we're right about here, right?"
"1322560","1327000"," We're going to take this into a better time frame down here, right?"
"1328620","1332540"," We know that we have some more resistance above here."
"1332540","1336200"," I know some of you guys are going to be like, we've got some more resistance over here, Cap,"
"1336520","1339860"," because we talked about this channel the other day, right?"
"1341100","1342840"," We talked about this one right here. "
"1342860","1344980"," You can see that break above, right?"
"1345300","1345740"," Snapped higher."
"1346180","1347440"," And we're starting to trade down here."
"1347440","1349000"," We've got some light resistance here. "
"1350180","1351480"," I'm going to put this one up."
"1351920","1358770"," There's going to be chartis guys out there going to be like, we're going to be like, let's even put"
"1358770","1360050"," this one down here maybe."
"1360050","1367370"," Redbook retail sales for the first two weeks at 14.3%, 15.4% for the weekend at February 12th. "
"1367510","1368750"," That one right there."
"1370150","1380010"," And we're going to put some, we've got 45, we've got 43.70 down here, 43 "
"1380010","1381450",".50. We'll raise that one up."
"1384590","1385390"," 4,500. "
"1389840","1391280"," We can lower that down a little bit."
"1394940","1404580"," We'll get another one over here for 45.20. Let's see if we can get that a little bit higher."
"1406460","1407900"," Make this one nice and fat and thick. "
"1410500","1412160"," We've got a big fat four up here."
"1417730","1425880"," And we're going to make this one right here nice and fat, right?"
"1426280","1428720"," And then we, so we've got a lower bound down here."
"1428800","1429940"," We've got a higher bound up here. "
"1430000","1431920"," This is our trading zone in here, right?"
"1433140","1435840"," I will snap some support and some resistance."
"1436940","1438080"," We make this smaller."
"1446910","1448350"," Let's see it right here, right?"
"1449270","1451590"," Support, area of support, area of resistance currently. "
"1452170","1455210"," Come back down here, retest this and try to trade higher."
"1455370","1456950"," We'll make this one nice and fat and thick."
"1457530","1459650"," We know that this is the big bad boy over here. "
"1461210","1465530"," And so this should give you your day ahead of you what you're looking for, right?"
"1465790","1466910"," Maybe you're retest down below."
"1467490","1471350"," Trade higher and read and come back to retest this 4, 4, 6, 8 area."
"1472310","1474830"," And try to again attack above here. "
"1475190","1476190"," And I guess that would be the point."
"1476350","1478030"," This is basically what spot camera is saying, right?"
"1478930","1479310"," Trade down."
"1480050","1480930"," Make an attempt. "
"1481650","1482530"," Come back up here."
"1482870","1483690"," That would be the ultimate."
"1484550","1487430"," And to Friday, if we can get something like this for the next three days. "
"1488330","1492790"," And to be aware of negative news at any moment."
"1493690","1497850"," You're going to be looking at any of these resistance points for negative news coming out."
"1498150","1503150"," You'll be like all of a sudden you'll see Biden come out and say some bullshit like or Kirby or"
"1503150","1503970"," whoever the fuck it is. "
"1503970","1508710"," I'm out there and say some stupid like, you know, we're, you know, we got this going on."
"1508810","1512650"," You're going to see some some hot come up in the Fed and say something stupid."
"1512990","1515510"," Or it'll be something some kind of economic news in the morning. "
"1515510","1517850"," We play straight here or right here."
"1517970","1520190"," And you have to be concerned about this, right?"
"1521110","1523330"," So just just be conscious of this chart."
"1523930","1526210"," I'll post this for you on Twitter. "
"1528510","1531350"," And then we see this right here."
"1531350","1534610"," So this should be your easy peasy day trading chart."
"1535190","1537490"," You can see about the half snapback on this. "
"1537910","1540110"," We can also measure this too if you want to."
"1540870","1541790"," You see here."
"1543170","1545130"," I'm going to measuring to a lot of here. "
"1548860","1549780"," We're going to do this."
"1549900","1551300"," I think this one's the price range."
"1556910","1563880"," It's like 1.4%. Right about there. "
"1565140","1565660"," Right."
"1565940","1567600"," So that's the range, right?"
"1568000","1573100"," We swung down and now we're swinging up right to this 1.7% shocker."
"1573180","1577220"," It pretty much matches right where we're headed up here. "
"1577380","1577540"," Okay."
"1577980","1581800"," You guys can see that 1.7% move up as we're looking for."
"1582060","1588420"," We swung low and now we're going to attempt to swing high to this upper bound area above. "
"1589740","1590400"," Make sense?"
"1590940","1593700"," You can put some other if you guys want everyone to snap in."
"1593700","1594740"," Some other support areas."
"1595020","1597060"," We've got one minor one right here. "
"1597520","1597780"," Right."
"1597860","1600340"," We've got another minor one down here you can look for."
"1600600","1606980"," We can look on a book map today and see what's going to take place with this, right?"
"1607340","1609020"," We'll correlate this to book map. "
"1609320","1610740"," And then the last thing I want to show you."
"1610840","1612020"," I'm not going to show you the weevil right now."
"1612100","1613620"," I'm just going to leave that with you when he asks. "
"1613860","1616680"," I need to talk to you with authorities about extending."
"1617220","1621300"," It's a bad loan guarantee scheme by as much as 24 months, really."
"1621920","1623860"," Now I want to show you one other thing. "
"1624020","1626040"," Some other key points of interest."
"1626740","1628160"," And I want you to look at this."
"1628340","1628480"," Okay. "
"1628660","1630940"," You've got a value area lows way down here."
"1631160","1631260"," Right."
"1631680","1632680"," Traded up to it. "
"1633000","1636800"," Got a huge iceberg up here of sellers just hiding above."
"1637500","1639660"," That's between make note of these levels here."
"1639900","1646820"," 4462.04. Next one would be the attack of 4505. "
"1647400","1651280"," And then value area high is 45 or 45."
"1653000","1654280"," Here 456813."
"1655400","1658000"," But notice that we're trading lower here, right?"
"1658800","1660880"," Notice they have resistance above here. "
"1661240","1661820"," We have a night."
"1662000","1664940"," We have light support here, but it's still not huge, right?"
"1665400","1668200"," So we can easily trade back down to this 4416."
"1669320","1671760"," 0.11 easily trade back here. "
"1672180","1677820"," We could easily trade back to 4435.27. And we could easily grind up here."
"1677940","1678800"," Let's say we come in here."
"1678880","1680720"," We buy some calls and boom. "
"1680940","1685000"," We get here with resistance again at 4461 and we end up grinding."
"1685000","1686680"," You end up getting caught inside of your calls."
"1687600","1693440"," You end up getting caught inside your calls and then they hold you from now until Friday. "
"1693960","1695820"," So just be conscious of these levels above."
"1695820","1703020"," We have a lot of work to do to be trading higher than this resistance above currently where we are,"
"1703160","1703300"," right?"
"1703440","1704320"," We already talked about this."
"1704780","1707620"," We charted this chart out on ES. "
"1708900","1710740"," So now that we're done with this, right?"
"1711140","1712460"," You guys see that?"
"1713580","1718800"," So this is a volume profile of the market, 15-day, 15-minute chart."
"1719620","1723040"," I will post in the chat today the script if I can."
"1723040","1724860"," If I can, I'll attempt by the time. "
"1725140","1727960"," If you have a slow time in the market today, remind me, just yell at me."
"1728380","1730780"," And I'll post the script for you guys who you guys can put it on."
"1731020","1731340"," I don't know. "
"1731780","1736500"," The only thing I use, I think, or swim for is volume profile, market profile."
"1737020","1738240"," I can send you that script too."
"1739140","1741640"," I've got a volume profile script, a market profile script. "
"1742100","1747740"," And then I used to use it for news from Ben Zinga, but I don't trade on this platform."
"1748240","1752560"," So I don't use, I don't use, there's a couple of other things I've used it for in the past."
"1752560","1757160"," I use it for some of the scripts that, what's his face, what's out?"
"1759100","1760260"," Fucking Brian Watt. "
"1760820","1762480"," I used to use his scripts on Thinkorswim."
"1763440","1768540"," And then I had to, I made a new account for you guys so that you guys can't steal my"
"1768540","1768840"," shit."
"1769600","1771500"," So I got a new account on Thinkorswim. "
"1771760","1773220"," And I need to get new scripts for this account."
"1774640","1775520"," Does that make sense?"
"1778790","1780290"," It updates constantly."
"1780670","1782010"," It's constantly real time. "
"1782010","1783750"," It's like 15 minutes off or something like that."
"1785470","1793250"," And some guys, if you guys go into the Discord, I think we've created a channel, we're supposed to"
"1793250","1795090"," create a channel for those scripts."
"1795970","1797590"," I think there's a bunch of people with scripts in there. "
"1798190","1802290"," So the zigzag and there's a bunch of other ones that he uses that he's giving out to people."
"1802490","1803210"," He's used to give them out."
"1803450","1807330"," When I used to follow him and he used to give them out all the time. "
"1807330","1811850"," And then he disappeared and he wasn't stingy about it at all."
"1812350","1814610"," But he would put him out and then he would delete the tweet."
"1815310","1818790"," And so he kind of had to be there, Johnny on the spot and get that stuff from him. "
"1819530","1825310"," I know those people inside of the Discord that have a lot of those scripts and they want to curate"
"1825310","1827210"," them because the guy's a fucking awesome trader."
"1827850","1829390"," So we're going to get rid of this one now."
"1830010","1832030"," So this is how we start to look at our week. "
"1832610","1835790"," If today was Monday or Sunday, this is how I layer my week."
"1835790","1837970"," As I'm traditionally, I'm charting traditionally."
"1838950","1840770"," I'm looking at what Spock is saying. "
"1841310","1848310"," I'm looking at the volume market profile, the other data profile right now, but I will get them all"
"1848310","1850010"," put them side by side for you one of these days."
"1851430","1856210"," And then so we're doing those three things and then I'm laying out flow."
"1856210","1857310"," I'll go during the daytime. "
"1858450","1859910"," And so I'm using flow."
"1860090","1865690"," I'll go and the dome on book map through the throughout the data, make informed decisions in our"
"1865690","1865930"," trading."
"1866150","1867550"," And then we're listening to trade the news. "
"1868390","1869950"," So that's how we go about things."
"1870830","1871910"," I tend we do."
"1872110","1873570"," I'll do DD on. "
"1873950","1875670"," We are meeting with the German Chancellor."
"1876110","1879050"," Putin says Germany is one of Russia's key partners."
"1880530","1882670"," I'll do due diligence on specific stocks. "
"1882830","1884210"," I've done videos on those."
"1885390","1892310"," I've done videos on those in the past how I trade stocks that are moving."
"1892310","1894950"," But the banks are moving and then how to catch knives properly. "
"1902170","1908390"," But I don't specifically, this is specifically what we use for trading the spy."
"1908730","1912130"," And if you guys want to know why I trade the spy mostly, it's because of liquidity."
"1913250","1919790"," Oftentimes I'll trade stocks and especially recently, there hasn't been liquidity in the market. "
"1919790","1924110"," I know that some of you know, I haven't even noticed in some of my trades that have gone my"
"1924110","1925490"," way in individual tickers."
"1925610","1930550"," They're still not printing even when directionally they're moving in the direction that I pick."
"1930850","1933310"," There's not enough liquidity in the market for me right now. "
"1933750","1938130"," Trading options often on tickets in this market."
"1938270","1939490"," Sometimes I'll still trade Tesla."
"1940350","1942510"," But a lot of the tickers I'm picking up on. "
"1942790","1947010"," I'm in a trade and I'm stuck in it now for two, three weeks waiting for a print."
"1947010","1953490"," The most liquid index or ticker or index out there for me right now is the spy."
"1953650","1954790"," I can get in and out of trades. "
"1954870","1960550"," I'm not locked in sitting in the background waiting for for more news or more."
"1960750","1964010"," Someone shining the light on Mike ticker hoping that it goes up."
"1967200","1969200"," You guys want to see volume profile on Tesla?"
"1969580","1970660"," You guys want to shout out some. "
"1971460","1973600"," No, you guys want to shout out a few tickers."
"1974660","1976300"," I'll look up whatever you guys want."
"1976780","1979820"," We had like file to fully 905 so. "
"1981320","1982100"," Bust out."

"1994980","1997620"," So maybe that guy will be a turn the volume up. "
"1997860","1998880"," The music was jamming."
"1998880","1999460"," I had to turn it off."
"2001100","2002120"," Good morning, everybody. "
"2002380","2004020"," So here's Teslas, right?"
"2004160","2007040"," You guys want to see volume profile on Tesla last 15 day by the 15 minute."

"2010840","2011800"," Gorgeous support here. "
"2012080","2014040"," And we're right back to 900, right?"
"2014480","2015560"," You guys want to see it?"
"2015700","2017080"," Every day we talk about this, right?"
"2017300","2017960"," Buy it down low."
"2018340","2018800"," Sell it up high."
"2019020","2019660"," Buy it down low. "
"2020340","2020740"," Sell it up high."
"2020840","2022040"," Remember yesterday we talked about."
"2022380","2024620"," Hey, we've got you guys look at the dome, right?"
"2024760","2027660"," You guys are looking at the 100,000 sellers above 900. "
"2028260","2030280"," This is the this is backing it up, right?"
"2030520","2032020"," We talked about this yesterday as well."
"2033760","2034560"," Alright, so hold on."
"2034680","2034880"," Hold on. "
"2035020","2035400"," Easy everybody."
"2035740","2037060"," We'll go through them one at a time."
"2037780","2039520"," You guys are crazy out there. "
"2041880","2042720"," Alright, HLT."
"2044020","2044860"," Alright, HLT."
"2045080","2045780"," We'll look at HLT. "
"2045960","2046380"," This is a good thing."
"2046480","2047280"," We don't ever do this, right?"
"2047460","2048840"," Maybe we start doing this every single morning."
"2049820","2051760"," Okay, you're at your individual tickers. "
"2053659","2054280"," Hilton worldwide."
"2055460","2055739"," Oof."
"2056520","2056940"," Oof. "
"2057739","2058960"," I don't know about that one."
"2060320","2063080"," Where's value area on HLT?"
"2063400","2073300"," 144.89. 144.89. You already want to hear"
"2073300","2074460"," what I have to say about that, do you?"
"2075739","2076980"," You could trade higher."
"2077679","2079380"," You possibly could trade higher. "
"2079900","2082040"," You've got a support level 150, 21."
"2083020","2084639"," By the dip is at 145."
"2085679","2087120"," We should do this. "
"2087120","2088460"," We should do this more often."
"2089900","2091659"," I like AMD right here."
"2091820","2092100"," Look at that. "
"2093920","2095719"," Look at this is beautiful."
"2096440","2098140"," AMD is holding on for dear life."
"2098140","2102280"," And it could trade easily to 118, easily to 122. "
"2102800","2104260"," I think we went over this one yesterday too, right?"
"2104540","2106920"," We had a price start of like 125, I think."
"2107320","2108220"," Must be lower though."
"2108620","2110480"," I'd look for some resistance at 120. "
"2111040","2112240"," I've just called it a flat 120."
"2112780","2114340"," It was a good trade right here, by the way."
"2114900","2115300"," AMD. "
"2116720","2117120"," Apple."
"2117760","2118760"," And then Palantare."
"2120100","2120920"," We'll do a bunch of these. "
"2121140","2122340"," Take 10 minutes out and do some of these."
"2123020","2123440"," Look at that."
"2123940","2124020"," Apple. "
"2124400","2124660"," Wham."
"2124860","2125300"," Trades higher."
"2125880","2127020"," Now it's sitting on some support. "
"2127020","2128720"," Has lots of room to run."
"2128940","2131600"," It's actually bolsters the opinion that Spy can go up."
"2131880","2133040"," We started looking at all these underlines. "
"2133340","2135660"," The queues might have a nice day today."
"2136020","2137980"," Might even have a better day than the Spy."
"2138480","2139860"," Looking for a price target of 171. "
"2141000","2143860"," Let's call it 171-27 on Apple."
"2144800","2146340"," Look at PLTR next."
"2148160","2149360"," You should do these more often. "
"2150100","2152320"," Never thought to look up individual tickers for you guys."
"2152620","2152860"," Oof."
"2153580","2153880"," Rough. "
"2154840","2155660"," Valley area low."
"2156080","2156440"," 1277."
"2157280","2157760"," Point of control. "
"2158140","2158500"," $13."
"2160440","2163120"," It looks like it looks like it's trading down this morning."
"2163300","2166400"," I could be wrong on this, but I think it's on the how it's right here. "
"2166900","2167440"," It's in right here."
"2167520","2168240"," Ooh, yeah, I like this."
"2169080","2170600"," Looks like I got the bump, right?"
"2170760","2171320"," The cold bear bump. "
"2171880","2173520"," And it could be trading much higher."
"2173880","2176060"," Actually, a little bit of resistance at 1365."
"2177120","2179260"," And then a value very high is 1383. "
"2179720","2182600"," But this is a nice structure right here for where you're lying."
"2182600","2186340"," You're sitting on a place where you could trade higher here."
"2186600","2186980"," Good job. "
"2187540","2188380"," PLTR out."
"2189460","2191120"," What else you guys want to do?"
"2191420","2191660"," Uber?"
"2193760","2194020"," Nine away."
"2194200","2194780"," We got a few more minutes. "
"2197750","2198370"," Look at Uber."
"2199130","2199350"," Damn, Uber."
"2200330","2200850"," Damn. "
"2202230","2203270"," Uber's dirt cheap."
"2204490","2206250"," Lots of sellers on high."
"2207310","2208050"," Lots of sellers. "
"2208830","2210230"," We're going to bring Uber out to..."
"2210230","2211830"," Let me bring change the data on Uber here."
"2216620","2217140"," Excuse me."
"2218640","2223160"," You guys want to look 20-day?"
"2223600","2225460"," Let's see if I can change this. "
"2226220","2226480"," I'm tired."
"2228500","2229500"," We'll go deep."
"2231020","2231920"," Time axis. "
"2233200","2234180"," I only have 10-day."
"2234260","2235360"," I thought I had the 15-day up."
"2235660","2236600"," Look at the 15-day. "
"2237440","2238200"," I've got 15-minute."
"2239380","2239440"," Apply."
"2242160","2243540"," It's still really low here. "
"2244760","2246160"," I don't know about Uber."
"2246940","2248080"," Uber looks like it's slipping."
"2248720","2249440"," You want to buy Uber?"
"2251100","2252360"," You want to buy Uber?"
"2253680","2255880"," If Uber trades up today, yes. "
"2256260","2257300"," Take the trade after..."
"2257300","2264440"," If it trades above $35.16, then I would take that trade to $37.08. That's a tough one."
"2264760","2264960"," Tough call."
"2266700","2267580"," Uber's a tough call. "
"2268180","2269060"," AMD POUNTER."
"2270900","2271420"," CPNG."
"2274510","2275030"," CPNG. "
"2275730","2276490"," We'll do this one."
"2278350","2280530"," It's a tough one too, right?"
"2280830","2281890"," CPNG is looking kind of weak."
"2281910","2282930"," We can get some support here. "
"2283310","2286190"," $22, but the value area is $18."
"2287450","2287970"," $18."
"2288630","2293110"," Look for your first level support at $21.08. Maybe some of you guys are looking for shorts here. "
"2294110","2296010"," CPNG, PTON."
"2296250","2297130"," I'll do PTON next."
"2299660","2300460"," PTON. "
"2301060","2302900"," Hold on."
"2304340","2313780"," PTON supports down here at $29.20. Call it $30.53. Lots of sellers above here"
"2313780","2319270"," at $35.62. ABMB."
"2325390","2325830"," ABMB. "
"2326610","2327890"," Nice support here in Airbnb."
"2328710","2331370"," But again, Airbnb is a value area of low."
"2331530","2332930"," I mean, just point of control is down here. "
"2333030","2333250"," $142."
"2334390","2335290"," Just be conscious of this."
"2335330","2337170"," You really need to be trading higher here. "
"2337710","2343350"," These are sellers stepping in trying to sell it down and take profit back down to $143."
"2345990","2346530"," KDP."
"2350720","2352420"," I like KDP here. "
"2352640","2354000"," This is a nice move for KDP."
"2355460","2362160"," You've got traffic up to $38.32. A lot of work to do."
"2362300","2363820"," I do like this structure though. "
"2364400","2372840"," Just know that the buy zone is $37.62 and your sell is $38.71. I have a lot of"
"2372840","2373780"," work to do in this ticker."
"2374980","2375420"," KDP."
"2375640","2376080"," Roblox. "
"2376700","2377140"," RBLX."
"2378300","2380880"," We'll do this until $9.15. I'll do it as long as I can."
"2382300","2383920"," Same thing with Roblox, right?"
"2384720","2390460"," You want to be buying down here at $61 and it's right at where it's sell at, right?"
"2390600","2391700"," That sell is at $69. "
"2392080","2393500"," It doesn't make you can't trade higher from here."
"2394040","2395460"," There's a lot of support in here."
"2395560","2396440"," I like this support. "
"2397340","2399400"," So actually I'm bullish on Roblox here."
"2400620","2401520"," A coin."
"2403900","2405760"," I'm actually bullish there on Roblox. "
"2406260","2409820"," If there's no bad news, you're forming a nice base on Roblox."
"2411000","2412540"," Same thing goes for coin."
"2412880","2414840"," You've got some traffic up here, right?"
"2415080","2415560"," Up till $206. "
"2416920","2419620"," The buy is down at $180 down here."
"2420480","2424940"," You need to be trading this higher to make your next leg up."
"2425780","2428000"," So anything over $206 would be a nice trade higher. "
"2428480","2432460"," Right now, though, you can see that there are sellers looking to push this down."
"2432720","2434000"," I would call this a day trade."
"2434520","2437140"," So $180 to $206. "
"2439040","2439800"," You need better."
"2441480","2442620"," You guys want to see VIX?"
"2443280","2443620"," Oh, yeah."

"2505120","2506600"," Some weirdness going on."
"2508020","2508500"," Okay."
"2508840","2510700"," Amazon is a tough one, right?"
"2511240","2517560"," I would not be taking along here unless you trade above $32.21. This looks like, I mean, this is"
"2517560","2518200"," not good here. "
"2519700","2521560"," You're going to be looking to give half of this back."
"2522220","2530500"," Not guaranteed, but look for support at $300.006. And then down again below at $20.28. I would not"
"2530500","2537640"," be taking this long unless you're above $32.11.79. What's the other one?"
"2537980","2539260"," John, were you asking?"
"2539960","2540400"," Four."
"2540780","2541280"," That's right, brother. "
"2546020","2546780"," Oh, yeah."
"2547540","2549140"," This is a nice dip-eye over here."
"2550920","2556940"," Look for a dip-eye anywhere between $52.61, $53.39. It's a gorgeous chart right here. "
"2557840","2562080"," You can get some kind of a dip right here and another buy to take it higher at $51.57."
"2562900","2564080"," Anything down in here."
"2564200","2565040"," I like this chart a lot."
"2565320","2567000"," This is a very strong chart, John. "
"2568540","2569060"," Riot."
"2572220","2574020"," It's like a riot, the blockchain."
"2574760","2576800"," I'm going to be pissing off a Quinn here. "
"2577620","2579000"," Sitting on some thin support."
"2580820","2582300"," It's trading high right now."
"2582700","2589740"," The expectation would be that it trades down to $15.62. You're hoping that it doesn't trade down"
"2589740","2590280"," here to $13. "
"2590280","2591660"," We have a bad market day."
"2592300","2595000"," Maybe, I don't know, heading into next week."
"2595500","2600840"," If you trade above $18.15, I would say take it for the leg higher. "
"2601320","2604720"," You want to be above $18.17 or so."
"2605220","2611300"," Otherwise, you are going to look for it to slip down to $16.83 and possibly even $15.60 or"
"2611300","2612980"," so."
"2614100","2614580"," BNGO. "
"2620270","2620750"," Nice."
"2621150","2621530"," I like it here."
"2622330","2623710"," I like BNGO here. "
"2624790","2626610"," It's right on value area low, $204."
"2627290","2628390"," I like this trade."
"2632640","2633040"," DNN. "
"2633580","2633860"," Okay."
"2643530","2644470"," I got this one right."
"2644630","2645570"," I don't know if I have this one right. "
"2646270","2648270"," If I have this one right, let me know."
"2649030","2654170"," Value area low is $1.18. It looks like it's going to trade down to at least that area there."
"2655110","2662360"," Third cheap dollar, $1.09. I think we sell at the open. "
"2663040","2663760"," I do."
"2664120","2665900"," I think we green bar it up and open."
"2666420","2669240"," And then I think we come back down, find some support and then we're going to trade up. "
"2669680","2673380"," I think you're going to get at least a couple of days of a couple of green days here."
"2674060","2676700"," I think I'm looking at it right now."
"2676720","2680500"," It's $9.16. I think we're going to test support somewhere down around. "
"2681060","2681760"," I'll give you a number."
"2682500","2688360"," We're going to test support at $441.47. Possibly dip as low as $4."
"2689200","2692720"," Oh, excuse me, $4, $4, $4, $0, $0. "
"2694020","2698940"," If we trade all the way back to $43, $5, it's a buy all day long."
"2699680","2701360"," And we're going to watch the news all day long today."
"2705080","2705420"," Nvidia. "
"2706920","2708000"," Well, you bet."
"2708680","2709300"," It's the Russians."
"2710260","2710520"," HD. "
"2711460","2712460"," I'll do HD for you."
"2713740","2715940"," Put in slots in a breast conference the other live right now."
"2716120","2716400"," Jesus. "
"2717420","2718200"," I mean, seriously."
"2718860","2722060"," The fucking presser is like shut the fuck up with the pressers."
"2722440","2724020"," Nobody wants to hear the pressers anymore. "
"2724200","2725100"," Oh, GT baby."
"2725960","2726320"," GT."
"2726800","2728340"," And Winky said this the other day, right?"
"2728780","2729500"," What did Winky say?"
"2730060","2734080"," Winky said after the sell off, anything down here is a good buy, right?"
"2734780","2738620"," Said this the other day, $15.56. I like this trade. "
"2739040","2740700"," I like this trade even with a bad market."
"2740920","2741680"," I like the good year trade."
"2742480","2744280"," I'm down on the good year trade. "
"2744800","2745940"," Absolutely 100%."
"2746400","2748220"," It's down at value area low."
"2748420","2749460"," We should do more of these. "
"2749920","2751380"," We should pick some tickers."
"2751380","2753000"," We should do these every morning if we can."
"2753140","2756180"," If I can get here early every morning, we'll start looking at tickers like this. "
"2756720","2758900"," And I can actually put more time on these."
"2760000","2762940"," This is a good one to even put a time access on them."
"2763560","2765840"," I can do whatever you guys want, right?"
"2766260","2766620"," 180 days. "
"2767480","2768680"," Let's do like six months."
"2768960","2770620"," Let's do a six month hold."
"2772840","2776180"," Let's do a six month hold on GT, right?"
"2776360","2777560"," Winky called this one out, right?"
"2777740","2779480"," You got over six months or cheapest. "
"2779480","2784500"," You should be buying it as $14.97. But even now it's sitting on value area low."
"2785380","2786820"," So GT, great ticker."
"2787100","2787940"," Good job on that one. "
"2789360","2790500"," We need to do more of these."
"2791620","2795300"," I need to do a 15 minute 15 day is my favorite."
"2795300","2796700"," So time access. "
"2802060","2804100"," I like 15 minute 15 day."
"2804500","2805840"," 10 days is pretty good too."
"2805920","2806980"," 21 days even better. "
"2807660","2808680"," Take a look at the 21 day."
"2808820","2810140"," I'm moving average on these tickers."
"2810920","2811840"," I like GT. "
"2814080","2815040"," Are you guys saying?"
"2819110","2820510"," Oh, see HD."
"2820930","2822890"," I'll do HD next to another good one."
"2826120","2827040"," Deep up. "
"2829170","2830510"," It's trading higher, right?"
"2830810","2834590"," Trying to tag that value area low here, right?"
"2834590","2838290"," $3.4.72 has a lot of work ahead of it."
"2838710","2840190"," So what would this show you right here?"
"2840290","2845530"," This is going to show you that maybe you buy a stock on this one or you buy a long"
"2845530","2846850"," dated call on it."
"2847170","2850750"," You don't even mess in with calls in here on Home Depot, do you?"
"2851190","2853450"," And you've got a ton of sellers above here too. "
"2854070","2856750"," I might be more bearish on Home Depot right now."
"2857350","2858390"," This is a tough one to be looking at."
"2858710","2861830"," Let's look at it on a farther time frame here. "
"2861830","2867220"," We should spend a Sunday doing this stuff."
"2868420","2871560"," And maybe we should spend a Sunday doing something like this."
"2872660","2873620"," 180 days. "
"2875500","2877100"," And see what it's looking like."
"2878120","2879660"," Not so low anymore, right?"
"2881260","2881740"," 289."
"2884040","2884880"," Sellers, sellers. "
"2886760","2888260"," Still trading kind of high right now, right?"
"2888940","2889600"," Over six months."
"2890740","2892180"," You can see that's high."
"2892440","2895140"," Trading lower, lower, lower, lower. "
"2895720","2896540"," Where does it find support?"
"2897760","2900460"," Looks like it's looking for $3.29 minimum."
"2900880","2901640"," That's what it looks like."
"2902300","2906060"," Also look for reaction down here at $3.40. See if it can find some support. "
"2906820","2908500"," Looks like a decent area of support here."
"2908920","2910660"," You're still wearing out sellers above."
"2912990","2913390"," All right. "
"2916010","2917650"," She feels like a gift to me."
"2918170","2919070"," HD has earnings."
"2920110","2922390"," Yeah, I don't think that it doesn't. "
"2922730","2926090"," I'm saying that support lies below."
"2926350","2933190"," It's lying below at $3.38. And then also $3.29. And they're telling you right here that it's going"
"2933190","2934470"," to get dirt cheap even lower."
"2937160","2943660"," Yeah, which is so everybody already supposedly knew about Facebook. "
"2945520","2946440"," That's a good Facebook."
"2946440","2947080"," Oh, yeah."
"2947520","2948560"," Honey on GT. "
"2948560","2950760"," Every sound puts all day long."
"2950780","2953880"," Buy and sell puts all day long on GT."
"2956780","2958500"," Every sound puts all day long on GT. "
"2960000","2960880"," I mean, look at this."
"2960960","2962320"," Look at Facebook over six months."
"2963260","2963660"," BAM. "
"2964500","2966180"," When you think HD can't go lower."
"2967840","2969560"," And you think HD can't go lower?"
"2969940","2971240"," So what are you looking for over this, right?"
"2971380","2973860"," You're looking for you want to get bullish on."
"2974260","2975780"," These are single prints down here, right?"
"2976380","2978780"," Well, I'll show you this on another chart in another day. "
"2978920","2980400"," But you want to get bullish on Facebook?"
"2981000","2984440"," Anything above $2.50 is bullish."
"2985520","2990140"," And we'll look at, we'll bring it on a smaller chart chart."
"2990660","2993340"," I know you guys want to see it like 15 days out. "
"2994600","2996980"," You guys want a long term view on Facebook?"
"2998040","3000000"," Not bullish until over 15 days."
"3001680","3006720"," Excuse me, not bullish until over $2.50. You guys saw that guy, that guy on CNBC saying that they"
"3006720","3007160"," sold Facebook."
"3008360","3009800"," And then they're shorting the market. "
"3009960","3011320"," I'm going to talk to you guys about that as well."
"3011740","3012880"," This is a 15-day chart, right?"
"3013360","3014060"," Same chart, right?"
"3014220","3015600"," Can't get over $2.50, not bullish."
"3016960","3017280"," Very dangerous. "
"3017420","3022260"," That value area low right now at $2.17. Lots of traffic above here, right?"
"3022860","3023920"," Lots of traffic to get above."
"3024220","3024700"," Lots of work."
"3025280","3027060"," Lots of tons of work to get above this. "
"3027300","3030280"," So you wait for this to get higher and you take along from here, right?"
"3030500","3033320"," Straight up to $300, right?"
"3033320","3036800"," Right here, $2.50. Now we're going to talk about something real quick."
"3036940","3042120"," Guy came on, I forget his name right now, but he came on to CNBC yesterday."
"3042520","3043360"," And he made a fair point. "
"3043800","3048600"," He was one of these guys I was talking about where they said they bought the bottom at $4.20."
"3049340","3052100"," And everybody was like, I bought the bottom at $4.20. I bought fucking Netflix."
"3052460","3053120"," I bought fucking everything."
"3053880","3055140"," You guys should long this entire market. "
"3055260","3056560"," It's only retail traders are buying puts."
"3056880","3057420"," Blah, blah, blah, blah."
"3058400","3061020"," That's all I hear all this, all that garbage nonsense, right?"
"3061760","3064020"," And so then they came back and interviewed him yesterday. "
"3064840","3068420"," And they said, well, are you still fucking along the market right now?"
"3068800","3073400"," And he's like, oh, well, he's like, we dumped Facebook after they said their competition was"
"3073400","3073780"," TikTok."
"3073880","3074700"," We've never heard that before."
"3074940","3076680"," That was at like $2.50. He dumped it. "
"3077020","3080060"," It's gone down since, but he's still got his ass handed to him."
"3080280","3084700"," But the funny part was his point on CNBC, let's slip for some reason."
"3085020","3090600"," And this is what yesterday reminded me of yesterday was he said, well, we've got no good news. "
"3090600","3094680"," I just look forward to we know that we've got rates and QT and also the shit coming."
"3095400","3099260"," He's like, so all we've been doing is we get back up to that resistance channel."
"3099320","3100680"," I'm just shorting the fuck out of the market. "
"3101720","3102700"," That fucking simple."
"3103660","3109060"," So at any fucking moment on news, these guys with big money, I mean, big money, they're going to be"
"3109060","3109740"," short in the market."
"3110240","3113280"," Anytime he comes to that resistance level, I want you to know out there, they're going to short"
"3113280","3114020"," this fucking market. "
"3114600","3118140"," Anytime we throw up two, three, four hundred points on the board, they're going to short this"
"3118140","3118400"," market."
"3118400","3121980"," Every chance that they have these hedge funds have, they're going to be short in this market."
"3122540","3124400"," So you have to be nimble in this market right now. "
"3124780","3130840"," If you're going to buy bottoms, make sure you're buying them down at 420 or 435 or even lower at"
"3130840","3132840"," 400 or 290 or whatever."
"3133100","3134000"," These guys want blood."
"3134600","3140560"," They're going to trade it down for blood until they get a fat fat sell off at some point between"
"3140560","3140900"," now. "
"3141180","3143960"," I'm going to call up to now and I don't know."
"3144060","3146400"," I don't know if I don't care if it takes the entire year."
"3146400","3150080"," They're going to short this market down as long as we've got bad news coming out. "
"3150240","3151980"," That's more than likely going to be the entire year."
"3152060","3155740"," So every time we get, these guys admitted yesterday, you let it slip."
"3156620","3161220"," Every time we come up, we throw a few hundred points on the board, we just automatically show we"
"3161220","3161620"," don't even care. "
"3162120","3163820"," We're able to look to see what the news is."
"3164000","3164760"," We're just shorting."
"3165720","3167660"," He also mentioned the oversold conditions. "
"3168080","3172320"," As soon as it's oversold and we're not oversold right now, we're not oversold."
"3172880","3175100"," The moment we're oversold, we buy long."
"3175520","3178820"," In the moment that we fucking move up a few hundred points, we're shorting. "
"3180240","3183440"," That's the key right now."
"3184060","3184880"," That's what's happening."
"3185520","3186920"," We're not in full zone. "
"3187580","3190360"," The hedge funds are not and the banks are not."
"3190760","3191460"," They're in sell."
"3191740","3197140"," So they're going to sell this shit down until all the bad news is out. "
"3197500","3200260"," All the bad news is not going to be out for the rest of the year."
"3201000","3204480"," All the bad news is going to be here until the end of the year."
"3204960","3206960"," So these guys already know they're selling this market. "
"3207220","3208520"," They admitted to, I saw the good guy."
"3208660","3211560"," I've been tracking this guy for months now since like September."
"3212360","3216420"," And he came out yesterday and for some reason, the first time he finally said it. "
"3217020","3221000"," Because those previous interviews have always been previous interviews."
"3221280","3222340"," But oh, no, we're buying the dip."
"3222660","3223380"," Every time there's a dip. "
"3223480","3224100"," We're buying the dip."
"3224320","3224520"," We're buying the dip."
"3224760","3226100"," He let it slip yesterday. "
"3226100","3230640"," That nope, in fact, they're selling the shit out of this until it's oversold."
"3230840","3231700"," They do it every single time."
"3233020","3238720"," And then as soon as it's oversold, they're buying the dip in the moment that they get out of"
"3238720","3239500"," oversold conditions. "
"3239600","3242080"," They're going right back to shorting the entire market."
"3242640","3243560"," So that's what these guys are doing."
"3244260","3244480"," Okay?"
"3244800","3246440"," So be aware of that as we trade forward. "
"3247320","3251380"," If you are a bull, realize that any time negative news comes out, they're going to short the shot"
"3251380","3255820"," of this, especially if we're not a resistance or a major resistance."
"3256480","3257080"," They're going to short it."
"3257540","3259680"," They're going to short it if we're oversold. "
"3259860","3262700"," They're going to short it down until it's oversold."
"3262820","3267660"," So they're going to pound it like a fucking nail into wood as deep as dark as they can get"
"3267660","3267820"," it."
"3268060","3270220"," They could care less about you as a retail trader. "
"3276420","3278280"," Nothing goes down miles that said it."
"3280940","3284780"," Yeah, he hasn't shared it in the last few interviews."
"3285100","3285900"," This past few days. "
"3285900","3287660"," Only the past few days."
"3287960","3290260"," I'm talking about Dan Niles going back to September."
"3291300","3292160"," That is true. "
"3292540","3294060"," I'll fucking show it to you."
"3294360","3301640"," I'll show you his last YouTube video back on January 26th."
"3302020","3305020"," I'll show you his last YouTube video back on January 26th. "
"3305040","3306100"," He wasn't shorting shit."
"3306700","3308200"," He wasn't shorting nothing."
"3309080","3309700"," He was long. "
"3310460","3311300"," He was long."
"3311300","3316200"," He was not saying that he was shorting on a whim on anything out of oversold."
"3316860","3317860"," That's bullshit. "
"3318260","3319340"," That is all new."
"3319980","3322140"," He has never said that he's shorting this market."
"3323380","3323900"," Never. "
"3324880","3325400"," Never."
"3325680","3325880"," Never."
"3327420","3328760"," That is only recently. "
"3331220","3332020"," Only recently."
"3332180","3332760"," Well, you said that."
"3333480","3334400"," But he has not been. "
"3334560","3336960"," Well, he's not publicly said that he's shorting this market."
"3341360","3342260"," What do you got here?"
"3343280","3344360"," Any cheap ones."
"3344540","3345480"," Wait for dip and whim. "
"3345820","3347780"," Made money yesterday and then bought the stock."
"3348260","3350500"," A 15-minute trader on calls fast up and out."
"3350680","3352620"," But hold long on stocks in and out. "

"3358440","3358720"," I don't. "
"3359020","3359420"," I like Uber."
"3359620","3360160"," I've traded Uber."
"3365300","3365700"," Yeah. "
"3365860","3369700"," He said he was big short on SPACs and high evaluation stocks."
"3370660","3377300"," But he hasn't said that he's shorting the market on anything out of oversold until this past week."
"3378220","3378900"," And I'll bring that. "
"3378980","3380300"," I'll get that video for you."

"3389800","3391160"," I'll play those videos later today."
"3392080","3394260"," He hasn't told me that he's shorting the markets. "
"3394580","3395940"," I haven't seen him say that once."
"3396620","3402520"," Until this week was the first week that I've heard heard him say he's just blindly shorting the"
"3402520","3403940"," market straight out."
"3407740","3409280"," But I'll look at that, Thomas. "
"3410180","3410660"," Absolutely."
"3411000","3411480"," 100%."
"3411480","3412080"," Okay. "
"3412200","3414280"," So we've got one minute left until market bell opens."
"3414500","3418020"," We're looking for a move down and then we're going to take this."
"3418120","3419220"," I'm going to take this market long. "
"3429130","3430050"," So we'll add the."
"3430530","3431270"," We'll add the."
"3435440","3435860"," Yeah. "
"3436060","3440900"," And even at the even at the end yesterday, today's yesterday, I said under normal circumstances, I"
"3440900","3442100"," would have bought that clothes with everything."
"3443140","3444460"," And I couldn't."
"3444580","3447440"," I couldn't normally ought to bought that clothes all day long yesterday. "
"3447440","3450380"," But with the bullshit in the news right now, I can't do it."
"3451480","3452480"," I can't buy that."
"3452580","3455540"," I couldn't buy that clothes yesterday with the nonsense in the market. "
"3455980","3457580"," We talked about it into the bell yesterday."
"3458220","3460180"," Can you go long on the market?"
"3461120","3461880"," And I couldn't."
"3461980","3464880"," Normally out of any normal circumstance would have bought that clothes yesterday. "
"3465440","3466860"," But for me personally, it was too risky."
"3467680","3469460"," That news, the news overnight could have been anything."
"3481380","3481580"," Yeah. "
"3481700","3483140"," Dan Niles is a fucking liar."
"3483420","3484140"," Well, he's not a fucking liar."
"3484260","3484940"," I like Dan Niles. "
"3485340","3486360"," I can't say I don't like him."
"3487220","3491380"," What I don't like about Dan Niles is he didn't say before."
"3492220","3496060"," I'll show you the I'll show you the last couple of the like the pivot moments in the market"
"3496060","3499440"," interviews that he's done and what he's saying. "

"3516590","3523290"," Looks like we're looks like we're buying buyers here, but I'm going to be looking for a dipply"
"3525720","3527160"," thing tight here because I want to trade this."
"3532240","3534280"," Or do you guys think we just trade straight up, right?"
"3534560","3536520"," No, no, no, no, just unrelenting. "
"3537920","3538980"," That's possible as well."
"3540000","3543340"," If we trade it straight up, they'll be looking for some for some call flow here."
"3543760","3545160"," See if we can get some call flow. "

"3569730","3572470"," We'll load up IWM, see what's going on in the background."
"3573330","3576870"," We should have looked at IWM's profile earlier."
"3580380","3582920"," We'll see what's up with IWM as well. "
"3585630","3590210"," We'll scroll this out a little bit and take a look, see and see if there's any crazy support here."
"3591490","3596010"," Apple calls February 18th, 175 C, $35,000."

"3612200","3615880"," Look to break above 44519. "
"3617740","3618740"," See if we can trade higher."
"3618940","3620140"," If not, we should be coming back."
"3634180","3638140"," See if we can get a little bit closer here and see where those sellers are. "
"3641360","3647500"," And here they are right here 445.08. And there's some ice fires below."
"3648520","3651420"," A little more sellers coming above here."

"3667950","3672310"," see if we can break above this little bit of resistance. "
"3672710","3675330"," Looks like we've got lots more buyers than sellers here though."
"3681950","3683750"," Is everybody doing good to see you Robert?"
"3689940","3692780"," Wouldn't be surprised to 439 later today."
"3692780","3695500"," We jumped up from yesterday's close in the future and never looked back yet. "
"3695960","3696700"," Often we do."
"3696920","3699060"," So it wouldn't be a surprise to 439 later today."
"3702840","3707580"," How do you adjust your levels after ON session blows them out of the water?"
"3708200","3709020"," Or are they still valid?"
"3709520","3717200"," Yeah, so if you guys see the levels that are posted on Twitter, you'll see that the pivot is still"
"3717200","3720000"," adjusted to whatever the opening price is or should be. "
"3720380","3722580"," Still adjusted for that opening price."
"3723220","3724260"," They stay there."
"3724300","3726240"," I don't move those levels day in day out. "
"3726280","3726840"," They stay the same."
"3727380","3728380"," Same levels every day."
"3729140","3734220"," You got the ones on Twitter show the pivot point inside of the levels that are given. "
"3743050","3745370"," Now we showed the volume profile on Tesla."

"3865400","3867640"," 208 or at least that's the calls are for."
"3868680","3870240"," Look at Tesla real quick. "
"3895170","3899030"," See that huge wall of resistance up on Tesla."

"4216510","4218570"," Price target above is what we thought right?"
"4218570","4219770"," 1,000."
"4221830","4224030"," A lot of work for Tesla to trade higher from here."
"4228070","4229190"," So I keep this on the background. "
"4229530","4231910"," We're going to stay on the spy."
"4247530","4248910"," See what you guys are saying here."

"4267600","4269500"," The hero indicator is positive on the spy."
"4271780","4275620"," Tesla calls February 25th 1000 C."
"4276160","4277440"," Nice call expansion on Tesla."
"4278220","4281740"," The more of that we see the more of a chance that we trade higher. "
"4282860","4286640"," February 25th 1000 C for $151,000."
"4287860","4292420"," XOM calls now we saw some we saw some puts against oil earlier."
"4292420","4293760"," We saw puts where. "

"4318740","4319440"," Anytime brother."
"4320060","4320480"," No worries. "
"4320700","4322440"," I'll keep you guys on track today with Tesla."
"4322500","4324240"," I know you guys want to see Tesla go up today."
"4324580","4327620"," So I will keep it on in the background and I will keep you updated. "
"4327620","4329960"," Because there is resistance here on Tesla."
"4329980","4331260"," We know there's resistance here."
"4331280","4335060"," We know the day traders are buying it down at 850, trading it up to 900. "
"4336040","4339900"," You've got resistance, but you get a lot of traffic here between 9 and 950."
"4340540","4341900"," You really do want to see."
"4342300","4343740"," You want to see call expansion. "
"4344540","4346000"," That's all I can say to you, right?"
"4346120","4348160"," I've been trading Tesla for years day in and day out."
"4348660","4351380"," You want to see, you know, you want to see the $1000 calls."
"4351580","4353160"," You want to see the $1100 calls. "
"4353440","4354560"," You want to see the $1200 calls."
"4354560","4359620"," You want to see Maxi Uber, super duper calls on Tesla."
"4360220","4361700"," It's not that you're going to trade the $1200. "
"4362420","4367920"," It's that you're going to get the dealers to hedge that we're trading a trade in like $1100,000,"
"4368200","4368240"," right?"
"4369060","4370340"," So you want to see that expansion."
"4370640","4372100"," We are seeing it currently right now."
"4372860","4378940"," But I would say to you that if you trade this right here, it's tough to make money in options. "
"4379660","4381560"," It's better to buy over."
"4381560","4383860"," You buy over 950 to not to 1000."
"4384380","4388140"," You buy it at 850 or 900 between 85840. "
"4388540","4389980"," You trade this up to 900."
"4390480","4391120"," Take your money."
"4391460","4395100"," And then you get back in once we break above this volatility area here. "
"4395360","4396840"," I'm not a fan of trading and volatility."
"4398560","4401140"," It's hard money to make, but all the power to you."
"4403530","4409650"," Let the let other walk over other bodies of bulls to get to 1000. "
"4410950","4412690"," I would like to see 950 today."
"4413070","4414610"," Well, without doubt, I want to see 950."
"4419360","4421140"," I'll leave this up for testables. "
"4424520","4428540"," The sentiment of the market currently is 74%."
"4428540","4429680"," I don't know if that's accurate."
"4429960","4430800"," Sometimes it isn't. "
"4431320","4434700"," I'm going to reset this and see sometimes this."
"4436100","4439060"," The put to call ratio is not up to date sometimes."
"4439840","4440300"," Okay. "
"4440980","4442900"," All right, so I'm going to get back to you guys."
"4442900","4446380"," The put to call ratio is very bullish right now."
"4446480","4448300"," We're at 94% bullishness. "
"4448780","4453260"," We've got a 0.177 on the point on the put to call ratio."
"4455000","4461440"," We've got 8,658 puts to 48,963 calls."
"4463060","4464300"," Which is outstanding. "
"4465460","4468160"," I've got very limited put put action this morning."

"5521350","5526750"," I would be, uh, just be cautious for a moment as that news spreads across the market."
"5529220","5529660"," Yeah."
"5529820","5531660"," They've talked about that they were going to do this, right?"
"5532800","5533100"," Yeah. "

"5575920","5580240"," Uh, like, hey, we want to hire you to do this."
"5580500","5582100"," And then they gave them up. "
"5585720","5587460"," Shit like that has been known to happen."

"5731680","5734300"," Those are the markets just pausing right now to get some information."
"5735300","5735680"," I guess. "
"5737140","5739260"," Just take note of these levels if you're testable."
"5739840","5743120"," You're looking for some resistance here at 919."
"5743920","5745840"," A little bit of ice above at 924. "
"5747040","5748920"," Some resistance at 929."
"5749520","5752200"," A free ride into 938, 95."
"5753520","5754900"," Then 944, 21. "
"5755760","5758640"," Some major resistance at 948, 69."
"5760060","5761560"," So it would call what?"
"5761980","5763060"," Break through here at 918."
"5763900","5768320"," You got a little bit of resistance at 930 and then your next target's 950 on Tesla. "
"5768920","5769880"," Look at BA next."
"5778250","5778890"," Who needs to look at me?"
"5778970","5781310"," I was being powerful and not letting down towards NATO."
"5782230","5784070"," Everyone bullish on tech 10 years at two point. "
"5784070","5785790"," Thank you, Ma, for dropping that on us."
"5786270","5788230"," I was like a good bear."
"5788750","5789950"," Ma was a good bear. "
"5790810","5792870"," Ma comes in puts in pertinent information."
"5794270","5795330"," Stuff you need to know."
"5797870","5800910"," I was like a good bear and I like a good bull too that gives you the details. "
"5802550","5805190"," The information that we need and that is key, right?"
"5805730","5807590"," Remind of that for everyone that was bullish on tech."

"5836480","5839240"," That was part of the news that's been out there."
"5840160","5841160"," So what do you do?"
"5841260","5843320"," You blow up an IED, you rest a few people."
"5844120","5846800"," Then you make it look like you're trying not to start a war. "
"5848020","5849280"," Good morning, Invesco, how are you?"
"5851000","5855140"," We'll look at BA and then we'll look at how real X coins moving right on."
"5856140","5857740"," Uber up quite a bit, right on."
"5859400","5860640"," I want to take a look at Uber. "
"5866280","5867540"," Uber was down at 35."
"5868020","5870780"," Now it's up to 35.98. So we'll look at Uber as well."
"5870780","5875110"," You guys got Roblox, Uber. "
"5879860","5885060"," I think that we'll do a BA real quick."
"5890300","5891200"," Smashing and bashing."
"5892180","5900880"," It calls on NVIDIA"
"5900880","5906260"," February 18th, 287.5c. High algo score. "
"5908460","5913180"," WDC February 25th, 56c, $100,000."
"5932530","5934990"," Resistance above here on VA 220."
"5936210","5938870"," Then at 22472 and 22875. "
"5940790","5942130"," See where the real sellers are."
"5945530","5946590"," They're right there, bro."
"5948170","5949210"," They're right where we are. "
"5952310","5952890"," That's a tough one."
"5954770","5957350"," 66,000 sellers here and then above 223."
"5958570","5959990"," Looks like they're feeding from above at 230. "
"5962210","5963870"," 228, 54."
"5965110","5966610"," 224, 25."
"5970250","5974010"," Watching some puts come in on the queues, February 16th, 353. "
"5974710","5976270"," P, $180,000."
"5983140","5984340"," RBLX we'll do next."
"5985540","5986460"," Then we'll do EBR. "
"6007260","6008820"," Spy rolling over slightly."
"6010420","6012320"," Vix had a drop in it."
"6012820","6014860"," Looks like it's trying to close the gap above. "
"6016220","6018640"," The gap above is at like 29 or so."
"6025360","6028680"," Even if it rejects, it's looking to close that gap at 28, 29."
"6034200","6035500"," Looks like a Roblox next. "
"6040760","6042200"," Oh yeah, Roblox is nice."
"6043260","6044340"," I like it."
"6046660","6048940"," I like that support on Roblox. "
"6050000","6051420"," Beautiful chart right here."
"6053000","6054800"," That's 708, 209."
"6055340","6056980"," We have slightly more buyers than sellers. "
"6057560","6059720"," I like it just on the stock."
"6060580","6062040"," No reason not to own the stock."
"6064720","6066080"," Trading higher right now. "
"6066480","6067800"," Way more buyers than sellers."
"6068700","6071740"," Buyers feeding in at $66, $67."
"6072880","6075040"," Hopefully the Uber chart looks just like this. "
"6076180","6077100"," I like it."
"6080020","6080960"," I'll get it Uber next."
"6084680","6085800"," I like that Uber chart. "
"6086960","6088600"," I like that Roblox chart a lot."
"6090020","6091440"," Check out Uber and see what's up."
"6093080","6094380"," I don't think that I didn't like Uber. "
"6094560","6096760"," I just didn't like that the sellers were above on Uber."
"6097580","6099800"," So we'll look at Uber and see if there's sellers above or not."
"6100620","6101500"," That's what I thought it was. "
"6101700","6102420"," Maybe it could be wrong on that."
"6103160","6104860"," Maybe I'm just fucking crazy or something."
"6105940","6107120"," Maybe I made a bad call. "
"6110810","6112110"," Look it over and see what it says."
"6116380","6117840"," Smash it and bash it on Uber."
"6121400","6123080"," I need to hear a row. "
"6127250","6129430"," I've got two daughters."
"6132210","6133670"," My daughters are getting older."
"6134030","6135010"," I'm becoming an old man. "
"6137370","6138510"," I didn't realize that."
"6138510","6141590"," You get to kids and young and then all of a sudden turn around and get an old."
"6142290","6143370"," I guess I'm getting old. "
"6144270","6145590"," I've got two daughters."
"6147150","6149610"," One's a little bit of an older teenager now."
"6154780","6156200"," There's a tough call here on Uber. "
"6157540","6159580"," See it's coming into some resistance above."
"6162040","6163920"," Double the buyers that you do the sellers."
"6164280","6164440"," You know what?"
"6164860","6165500"," I'm wrong on Uber. "
"6166820","6170440"," Looks like the sellers are being absorbed quite nicely here."
"6170440","6173120"," Price target above on Uber changed my viewpoint."
"6174640","6177820"," 42.34. Looks like a grind. "
"6178400","6180680"," I think it showed a grind as well in the."
"6182240","6183580"," I think it showed a grind."
"6184080","6185220"," Maybe call spreads. "
"6186200","6189680"," You have to work through the grinding of trying to get rid of sellers here."
"6190800","6195440"," On Uber, but price target definitely 42.34. Just going to take some time grinding through the"
"6195440","6195740"," sellers."
"6197640","6201760"," These two dollars are at Valentine's Day for them. "
"6202880","6205340"," If you guys know, I don't know."
"6205500","6206780"," My daughters like boys."
"6208780","6210040"," It's definitely a matter of what they like. "
"6210360","6210840"," Boys are girls."
"6212040","6215540"," It's by calls February 16th, 446C, $106,000."
"6217220","6219480"," It's like the market's starting to snap out of it a little bit. "
"6221950","6222750"," See if you can trade higher."
"6224390","6226650"," Anyways, they don't get to interact with too many kids."
"6226830","6228770"," Because all this stupid COVID shit, right?"
"6229430","6230450"," Like everybody's going to be tested. "
"6230730","6231390"," Everybody's wearing masks."
"6231710","6232650"," Everybody's going to wash their hands."
"6233790","6234630"," It can't be here. "
"6234830","6235390"," It can't be there."
"6235530","6236070"," All that kind of stuff."
"6236290","6238070"," Now my kids are finally fricking triple vaxxed. "
"6240110","6241930"," And everybody's safe and all that kind of stuff."
"6242170","6242290"," So."
"6244690","6248650"," We're going to go to a concert this weekend for Valentine's Day. "
"6250820","6253720"," Which is like the concerts where like you're the only dude there."
"6253900","6256340"," It's like a bunch of women and like a bunch of girls."
"6257640","6259000"," Like smells like girls. "
"6259880","6260180"," Like kids."
"6272260","6273100"," No, I'm not."
"6273620","6274380"," I'm super. "
"6276680","6276960"," I'm not."
"6279200","6281780"," I lead my children by example."
"6282060","6282340"," That's it. "
"6282940","6284180"," I don't control them at all."
"6285620","6287040"," I'm doing whatever they want, believe it or not."
"6288180","6292400"," I think the better way to parent is, you know, like saying, don't put your hand in there. "
"6293120","6296080"," You explain to them what happens when you put your hand in there."
"6298480","6303100"," And then if they put their hand in there, you help them along with when they make a mistake, right?"
"6304000","6305240"," I always want to be there for them."
"6305600","6308440"," I don't ever want to be the dad where they're like, we can't tell dad. "
"6309780","6311360"," People will always tell me anything."
"6312700","6314040"," So don't judge them."
"6315520","6316160"," As children. "
"6316440","6319060"," They're both honors who they love more than honors."
"6319060","6322180"," Like one of them is skip to grade at the older one."
"6323700","6325340"," And the other one's on that same track. "
"6326140","6326460"," Great kids."
"6329060","6334640"," But I'm going to take them to a concert and it's going to be weird."
"6335280","6335900"," I'm not going to lie. "
"6336060","6337040"," Yeah, like one of those Beaver concerts."
"6343950","6345250"," Thanks for the heads up, Brandon."
"6349670","6350790"," Yeah, it's going to be nasty. "
"6351110","6351790"," Girls are nasty."
"6352090","6352410"," Kids are nasty."
"6352810","6353230"," Not just girls. "
"6353530","6354330"," Boys are nasty too."
"6355070","6357090"," Boys like slappin' on those."
"6357970","6360850"," They got overpowering deodorant. "
"6361010","6362650"," They got overpowering cologne on."
"6363510","6364930"," They got all kinds of hair shit in their hair."
"6365310","6367030"," And then, you know, they're kids. "
"6367490","6369330"," Like when you become an adult, you realize the kids smell."
"6370550","6371610"," Kids don't believe that."
"6371770","6374070"," But when you're an adult, you look back at a child, you're like, shit. "
"6374770","6375030"," You know?"
"6378590","6379570"," You leave in St. Mary."
"6379850","6380310"," Take it easy."
"6380490","6381170"," Have a wonderful day. "
"6383750","6385790"," But then you get like a whole group of them together."
"6386030","6387630"," You know, you got like 300 kids or whatever."
"6388030","6389370"," So I got to go do that this weekend. "
"6390090","6390370"," All right."
"6390450","6391850"," I'll take pictures and video, I promise."
"6392890","6394310"," It's like some Korean boy band. "
"6394830","6396130"," Some kind of Korean boy band."
"6400500","6402640"," I do want to make one note to you out there."

"6568370","6569210"," Yeah, I'm a weirdo."
"6569330","6571070"," You know how it is, right?"
"6571830","6575570"," Like for some weird reason, if I'm sitting there next to my daughters, or if I'm standing next to"
"6575570","6576790"," my daughters, I'll be like, all right, I'm cool. "
"6577490","6578990"," At least I'm supposed to be here."
"6579090","6580870"," It's kind of like the guy in the playground with his kids."
"6581730","6586610"," When I go to the playground with daughters, you know, they're like, you can't go to the playground"
"6586610","6589350"," and not be next to your kids because they think you're a weirdo in the playground. "
"6590290","6591830"," So I'm going to be the weirdo in the concert."
"6592250","6595130"," We got a boy band concert with like just some old man sitting in the corner."
"6595250","6595690"," It's going to be weird. "
"6598250","6599730"," So because of that, I've got all that paranoia."
"6599750","6602050"," I'm like, I'm like, I've got to make sure that my daughters are on."
"6602130","6604490"," Of course my daughters are like, I want to be around the old man. "
"6605130","6606050"," Leave us alone."
"6607530","6610950"," So I'm going to be relegated to be in the weirdo in the corner of the concert."
"6613350","6614910"," You know, like see a mom at the park?"
"6615810","6616310"," No big deal. "
"6616850","6619890"," See some like Burleigh guy in the park."
"6620170","6620970"," You can put every with your kids."
"6628230","6629030"," Oh shit. "

"6662800","6663760"," We looked at Uber. "
"6663980","6664840"," We looked at Roblox."
"6665760","6667780"," The rest of these I'm going to try to look at."
"6667960","6672600"," I'm going to try to look at them in volume profile and post them for you on Twitter. "
"6672880","6674020"," If you have time."
"6675340","6679120"," More buyers and sellers on spy here indicator positive."
"6682670","6685170"," I saw is pretty much equally matched. "
"6685310","6686530"," Looking for this resistance."
"6686930","6688490"," I'm scared about this right here."
"6689410","6691830"," I want to see like a slap down up here at four, four, five. "
"6693610","6694650"," Veil baby."

"6705110","6708170"," Looks like they're trying to buy some cheap car."
"6708170","6710130"," All our cheap shares on veil. "
"6710410","6710790"," I like it."
"6711350","6711870"," It's bullish."
"6713370","6714570"," Even though it's down the road. "
"6714850","6715110"," It's bullish."
"6719940","6721580"," A lot of consolidation here."
"6721940","6723220"," One key on this is. "
"6724200","6726420"," Foles can't pull it together here to move higher."
"6727560","6728880"," You will see a straight lower."
"6733760","6734900"," So Roblox this afternoon. "
"6737500","6738740"," Yeah, Cody, try to get in."
"6739000","6740000"," Try to pause the."
"6740260","6740960"," I kid you not. "
"6741100","6743540"," Like most of the time if I do these pre-market things."
"6744360","6745380"," They're worth every minute of it."
"6745840","6746960"," So pause the video. "
"6747460","6747960"," Get back."
"6748140","6749640"," Watch that half an hour and then come back live."
"6751700","6754160"," Honestly, most of the time if you're inside this stream. "
"6754680","6756160"," Without that context, it's tough."
"6756440","6757360"," I'm not saying you have to do that."
"6757460","6759360"," I'm just saying it's tough to be in stream. "
"6760020","6765160"," Listen to where we are in the market and not have a pre-context for the day."
"6768830","6769710"," I'm not saying you can."
"6769830","6772250"," I'm just saying that I found that. "
"6772570","6775070"," I found that like people are like where are we at?"
"6775290","6776030"," Why are we saying this?"
"6776030","6776810"," And why do we switch?"
"6776930","6777850"," And why are we over here?"
"6778490","6780650"," And then it leads to frustration for everybody involved."
"6786140","6786720"," No, no."
"6787600","6788900"," Cody, it's no big deal. "
"6789760","6790520"," It's not you."
"6790780","6791080"," It's more."
"6791280","6796960"," What I should be doing is I should be making the video in the morning and then like cutting off"
"6796960","6799120"," the live stream and then doing a second live stream. "
"6799760","6802420"," Like you get your daily brief in the morning, then you get your live stream."
"6803540","6805380"," See where you can play in the background somewhere else."
"6806960","6808640"," We're on for eight fucking hours. "
"6808640","6812660"," Like we're on fucking from nine thirty in the morning until well, right?"
"6812900","6813540"," No, no less."
"6813780","6815240"," We're on a no less than nine thirty."
"6815500","6818200"," Sometimes we're on eight eight thirty in the morning till four in the afternoon. "
"6818540","6819480"," It's a long day."
"6819980","6824700"," So, you know, you're like literally if you stop in for an hour and we're all like, yeah, we're"
"6824700","6829240"," going to the moon and then you stop back in four hours later and we're like, burn it to the"
"6829240","6829500"," ground."
"6829820","6830500"," Burn it to the ground. "
"6831200","6833840"," People are like, what the fuck is going on in there?"
"6834560","6835000"," Right?"
"6835000","6839280"," So you're kind of expecting one thing and you're getting some complete different."
"6839880","6843640"," And meanwhile, all morning long, we've been like, okay, so we're starting here."
"6844120","6846500"," Once we get to here, we're going to do this and then we get there. "
"6846640","6847320"," We're going to do that."
"6848520","6848840"," Right?"
"6849120","6851180"," And so it just gets all weird and discombobulated."
"6851500","6855520"," And then people show up in the middle of the day and they're like, I think I think some people"
"6855520","6857040"," show up but keep pivots too. "
"6857260","6858020"," Just keep pivots."
"6858520","6859320"," Some people just show up."
"6859400","6861540"," They're like, let's find out if he's screaming yelling at people. "
"6861920","6863220"," Let's find out if he's pissed off."
"6863220","6864840"," Let's find out if he's losing all his money."
"6865180","6868180"," Like, just so you get all that action going on as well inside the stream. "
"6869180","6869580"," Right?"
"6870720","6872080"," The wind moon puts right now."
"6872360","6872800"," Burn, burn, burn."
"6875180","6875700"," Yeah, you know what I'm saying?"
"6875840","6876420"," Does that make sense?"
"6876760","6878420"," Maybe like a do the first live stream. "
"6878860","6879620"," Shut it off."
"6880400","6881480"," We'll label it some different."
"6882480","6887300"," And then we'll just do like, we'll have a daily brief and then the live stream, like day trading"
"6887300","6887860"," live stream. "
"6888580","6890200"," So that way you can just get your fill."
"6891020","6891780"," It's separated."
"6893240","6894600"," I'm gonna have to start doing that, huh?"
"6895620","6897120"," Yeah, bipolar bear bull channel. "
"6900290","6902690"," Yeah, it's not your fault, Cody."
"6902770","6903250"," I love you, man."
"6903370","6903950"," You're awesome, dude. "
"6904330","6905090"," I fucking love you."
"6906670","6907490"," I totally understand."
"6909430","6912990"," It's not you specifically either, but there are other people that come into the stream and they're"
"6912990","6916350"," like, you know, why the fuck are you saying this and what the fuck is saying that?"
"6916430","6916550"," Okay. "
"6916950","6917950"," You have some good shit coming in."
"6918570","6923930"," February 16th, 352 C, $396,000."
"6926350","6927150"," QQQs. "
"6928370","6931570"," That's February 16th, 352 C, $396,000."
"6932350","6934390"," Then next up, next we've got QQQs."

"6965280","6966740"," Yeah, they show the best part of the stream."
"6968420","6969600"," UPST reports today."
"6969760","6970200"," Can you take a look?"
"6970380","6984730"," Hell yeah, I can take a look for UPST. All"
"6984730","6985650"," right, here we go."
"6988270","6989650"," UPST bipolar bear."
"6990270","6991010"," So true. "
"6991970","6994470"," Looks like we're trying to make a push above right now."
"6994470","6997430"," Here are indicators getting super duper, duper green, bullish."
"6998810","7000610"," You can break through this resistance. "
"7000810","7001630"," You really need to, right?"
"7002330","7003750"," Can't break through this resistance."
"7004710","7005970"," And Tesla can't move up."
"7007510","7008470"," Apple can move up. "
"7008670","7009230"," Some others can move up."
"7009370","7011690"," We've seen some of those others don't have a bunch of resistance above."
"7011690","7018330"," We want to see the spy smash and bash through through this resistance right now. "
"7020860","7021280"," Come on."
"7021460","7022400"," I want to take a long baby."

"7134480","7136940"," Where is 4,4,6,90 up here?"
"7138580","7141020"," It's not too high yet. "
"7143780","7146500"," Look at 4,4,8,7,0 or so."
"7151200","7153420"," Surprised we don't see more sellers up in here."
"7156860","7158580"," 4,4,8,90. "
"7159720","7161160"," Look at 4,50."
"7162680","7163780"," See what's up there."
"7165300","7166660"," There they are right there, right?"
"7169680","7171140"," 4,4,9,80. "
"7173480","7175000"," Still not really a huge sell."
"7175280","7176720"," Sell the news kind of a thing."
"7177400","7178380"," Even higher than that. "
"7179780","7180720"," There we go."
"7181940","7184340"," Those are the bad boys that are 4,50,22."
"7185040","7187060"," See that huge difference in sellers?"
"7188780","7193620"," This is where the, this is where like the, the, the bulls that are trapped are. "

"7217380","7217900"," 10 and apple."
"7218180","7218780"," Nice. "
"7224150","7230230"," EPTST. EPST. Throw a hero indicator on this one if you can. "
"7232510","7234410"," I hope it's going to work on this one."
"7242990","7245450"," I want to see a wall of calls coming right now."
"7246750","7254190"," Looks like Nasdaq is, is doing slightly better than, I don't know, maybe not. "
"7254330","7256310"," Looks like they're still consolidating as well, right?"
"7257170","7259410"," Nasdaq is looking similar to the spy."
"7261210","7263470"," And Vix looks like it's rolling over slightly."
"7263830","7265610"," They weren't able to quite put it together. "
"7266330","7267490"," Try to close that gap."
"7270460","7271840"," You have more sellers here."

"17034890","17042550"," on uh on our sub All free the one thing that we ask is that if you're a new trader"
"17042550","17050250"," poor trader Uh, you help support the stream by liking and subscribing it's free To do that, uh, to"

"17054250","17055970"," Hey, this is who I am."
"17056010","17065580"," I'm new here and If you are learning how to trade better if you're making money by trading And we"
"17065580","17070400"," ask that you help to support the stream just by donating whatever you can Uh, because these tools"
"17070400","17076320"," do cost money The time and effort that goes into doing the research to do diligence And the reason"
"17076320","17082120"," that we started this whole entire thing was because of the the huge volume of noise out there in"
"17082120","17090540"," the market two reasons Just the cacophony of misinformation misdirection and social media And the"
"17090540","17094600"," second reason would be that I've paid for most subscriptions out there. "
"17094680","17100620"," I've been a member all over the internet Uh, and I've paid lots of money, right 500 bucks 600 bucks"
"17100620","17107900"," thousand bucks a month And I I let the roadblocks are right into or lots of assholes Uh lots of"
"17107900","17112560"," snark, uh Like whoever's running the the trading room."
"17112560","17118040"," They would only show up once or twice a day They'd miss key pivots and I would I felt unconfident"
"17118040","17124480"," in those moments And so I would I felt like I was missing Uh missing something right?"
"17124580","17130480"," I'm like why am I paying these guys a thousand bucks a month to not have uh You know access"
"17130480","17135580"," to them And then to have a bunch of assholes inside of the inside of the group, right?"
"17137060","17139120"," So If this works, it works."
"17139320","17141420"," If it doesn't work, uh, we'll stop it, right?"
"17141660","17146280"," Until it breaks or whatever Uh, we'll just keep doing it and I think the other the third reason"
"17146280","17151640"," that it came out was because uh, there's a lot of people out there that They never tell their"
"17151640","17152220"," trades publicly. "
"17152720","17159120"," I always I always used to post my trades publicly on twitter As I took them, uh Where everybody had"
"17159120","17162280"," hindsight trading and so it's got to piss off at that, right?"
"17162520","17167560"," You got a guy out there with like million subscribers and yet They're just selling you something in"
"17167560","17168380"," the background, right?"
"17169880","17178860"," So that's that's what we do here And it gets crazy in here too Yeah, you can ask al merino"
"17179560","17181000"," It gets crazy in here."
"17181100","17188380"," We'll get wild chick going on we go off tangents We have crazy conversations Uh, we've got a bunch"
