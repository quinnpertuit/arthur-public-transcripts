"6580","9560"," Let's see what we're"
"9560","17700"," going to put on."
"39150","40010"," How are you, Black Friday?"
"40230","40290"," Everybody?"
"40450","40750"," Good morning."
"42310","45390"," Can we just second here and try to get everything up and running?"
"48830","49230"," Okay. "
"49570","60840"," So give me just a second here."
"60840","64220"," I'm going to kind of bring, this is a 15 minute chart just if you guys want to know."
"64820","66720"," Anyone that's here right now, good morning everybody. "
"67800","68420"," Good morning."
"68620","69160"," Good morning."
"69340","69540"," Good morning morning. "
"70920","71960"," Hold on a second here."
"72780","74180"," So we're going to go over a few things."
"74640","82280"," I've got the news up for you this morning to be able to hear the news, this is a 15"
"82280","82940"," minute chart. "
"83640","86900"," I don't know if I can get a nice, maybe I can get a nice five minute chart up, I"
"86900","88620"," can squeeze it all in."
"89400","90620"," Yeah, I don't think so."
"90860","91100"," Maybe. "
"91920","93920"," Let's see if we can get a 15 minute chart in there."
"94540","95800"," There's a five minute chart here."
"95920","96360"," This might help. "
"97640","98300"," Hold on here."
"101220","102840"," Yeah, that's pretty good right there actually."
"105780","107420"," Are you guys want a one minute chart?"
"107680","109380"," We could do a one minute bar chart possibly too. "
"109580","110720"," Let's see what we can get in here."
"114920","117200"," Let's see if we can get a one minute bar chart for the day."
"118860","119440"," This is kind of cool. "
"119560","120240"," We can probably do this."
"121660","122580"," Hold on a minute."
"127130","128789"," That's almost perfect right there. "
"129509","132130"," That's a one minute bar chart for the day."
"132430","134870"," This is our here's our three or two."
"135170","137010"," I didn't put in any of the previous lows. "
"137310","142130"," So in your own charts, you probably want to put on, you know, some previous lows and stuff."
"144490","149770"," But this chart does have at least our support the s threes down the bottom right over here s two"
"149770","151790"," s one pivot points."
"152310","153950"," We're still above the pivot point at this point. "
"155790","161830"," So I'll leave this chart, this paper chart up for you so you can relate it to the book map"
"161830","165350"," chart and see where real support is that kind of stuff."
"165990","168910"," You can kind of see where I cursor is this 400 down here."
"169410","171170"," This is kind of a magnet down here. "
"171890","176030"," So just by looking this morning, it looks like there is, you know, like some kind of a magnet down"
"176030","176450"," at 400."
"179030","181130"," Maybe that's where we get our three today."
"182650","186610"," We certainly don't want to break this line down here. "
"186730","189550"," If you look on book map, you can see that solid yellow line down below."
"190210","195310"," And we can see that have these sellers on book map as well, much higher up here, right?"
"195970","197670"," So I want you to pay attention to that today."
"199750","201110"," I'm going to leave up. "
"201690","205390"," So I have a bunch of stuff I have to do for next week for the stream and for the"
"205390","205730"," newsletter."
"206650","212290"," So we can, I can kind of streamline this stuff and let it, let it come out every week or"
"212290","212990"," not more."
"213070","214450"," Just consistently for you. "
"216450","219850"," So you'll have that done for me from me by Monday."
"223220","226000"," So today, if there's anything huge, I'll stop in."
"226700","232700"," If I have the time, I'll try to stop in and comment if it deserves a comment this morning. "
"235340","236600"," Who else is it going to see?"
"236600","241680"," If you want, I can quickly, well, I'll say good morning, everybody."
"241880","243720"," If you're all joining us right now, good morning to you."
"244180","250200"," So this stream, if ever have something else to take care of on a day, you'll see something similar"
"250200","250560"," to this. "
"250560","253640"," You're going to get a better book map version of book map as of next week."
"254280","256760"," And you're also going to get trade the news as of next week."
"256820","258339"," So you're going to get the best news service. "
"260899","262560"," So remember not here, okay?"
"263840","266360"," So just for today, this is a little be up."
"266980","268760"," You can listen to the news in the background."
"269360","272520"," It'll pop on and off as the news comes on. "
"272700","274160"," I would expect a light volume day today."
"274920","278400"," Just like I expected that too on Wednesday, but we didn't get it."
"278540","285080"," But today, it's a small, short day, only till 1 p.m. They could pin this market sideways right into"
"285080","285760"," the clothes too. "
"286640","289600"," Just to make sure that spreads prints for banks."
"291160","292300"," So be aware of that."
"293440","295840"," And this should correspond quite well right here, right?"
"296420","300600"," It doesn't correspond perfect, but you can kind of see with that for almost a second. "
"300760","302460"," You can get it to correspond better."
"307570","311130"," Yeah, so it's not perfect, but wait a minute, hold on a second."
"316610","324250"," So that S1 is, yeah, it's not going to correspond well. "
"326070","334550"," But you can see down here that 400, maybe paying attention to that, so you can see or it's the"
"334550","335230"," 4,000."
"336310","340870"," And that's right here, the yellow bar at the bottom of book map is right here in S1."
"341290","342350"," Markets look like they're supportive. "
"342750","350870"," The only concern, again, is above up here where my cursor is that you can see all those bars above,"
"351190","351270"," right?"
"352870","362770"," It's at 40.50. And that corresponds to that 40.50 corresponds to"
"362770","370830"," somewhere in here, this R2."
"372710","375450"," Currently, this is where the sellers are, they're right there."
"376530","383910"," The buyers are down below somewhere right here for today. "
"385310","390050"," Now, of course, as you get into those levels, you can see if we break through or break above."
"391850","397590"," But this is generally where it's at right now, just be conscious of that, that this is what it"
"397590","399010"," corresponds to book map."
"399610","402930"," Maybe we ping pong around and move, make a move higher or lower into the close. "
"403230","404130"," But there you go for today."
"405150","406230"," Good morning, all of you."
"408470","409470"," Please feel free. "
"409610","410010"," Good morning, James."
"410270","410470"," How are you?"
"410750","416010"," Please feel free to, if you're going to tune into this broadcast with us today, take the, this is a"
"416010","423350"," good day for you to take the time to meet each other in the broadcast, talk inside the chat, talk"
"423350","428050"," about trade setups that you're interested in and have people here backtest them for you."
"428050","429670"," Don't feel hesitant. "
"430090","437330"," You know, it's okay to be wrong and it's okay to ask, hey, I want to take a put spread"
"437330","438190"," against the market."
"439050","445510"," I thought about taking it right here today, where I thought about taking it once we hit the top of"
"445510","450970"," that channel of the downward overall trend since the beginning of the year."
"451590","457530"," Ask people in chat today what you're thinking about for trade setups and see if they can punch"
"457530","458450"," bullet holes in them. "
"458750","464730"," See if they can say, yeah, but this or yeah, but that, you know, you guys don't want to lose"
"464730","467090"," clout or ego."
"467930","474750"," But why do you care about your ego or clout care about making money that that's the most important"
"474750","478870"," part because in the day, let's say you, your trading plan is wrong."
"480070","483210"," You have a bruised ego, let's say, or bruised aid or something. "
"483830","490450"," If you make money on that trade because someone showed you a better way, that's all that's going to"
"490450","491110"," matter to you."
"491450","496890"," When your ego is put aside and your clout is put aside, the only thing that ever matters is making"
"496890","497330"," money."
"497930","504150"," And if you leave by making money, fuck your ego and fuck your clout and fuck what you think is"
"504150","508010"," your brain is telling you is the right way. "
"508010","516730"," So take the time today, talk to people in the chat, back test in chat, trade setups that you're"
"516730","524010"," thinking about so that so that you guys can try to make better trades, okay, as we head into the"
"524010","530490"," close of this week, there's a perfect day heading into a Friday, short trading day, start bouncing"
"530490","535370"," off your trade ideas with each other because you'll get some pop positive feedback."
"535570","542530"," This group of traders that are here, investors that are here, they want to help each other."
"543090","549730"," I've been in a lot of discords and I've seen so many shitty discords with real fucking assholes. "
"550230","550790"," Sorry for swearing."
"551670","552530"," They have to like see heaven."
"552990","557370"," But our discord, our group, our trading group, they help each other. "
"558230","565210"," So be open to trade ideas, be open to thought processes that can go against what you want to do"
"565210","569210"," so that you can think of all of the pitfalls in your trade."
"569430","573510"," Even if you're like I'm going to stay with my trading plan, at least you have some outside thought"
"573510","578250"," process so that you can look at the speed bumps along the way in your trading plan where the"
"578250","586130"," pitfalls that could arise in your trading plan for when to cut it loose or take profit or to add"
"586130","588930"," more to your position if it leans into your thought process."
"589430","596070"," If you're a new trader and you're tuning into the broadcast, this is a perfect day for you to throw"
"596070","602110"," some stuff up, some questions out there, ask questions, see if someone can help you out so that as"
"602110","607630"," you come along in the next few trading sessions, you can catch up with us and see where we're at"
"607630","611190"," in our trading plan, our trading view. "
"611190","618930"," Just for, I'm going to do a quick review for where I'm at so that you guys can see where"
"618930","627890"," I'm at for the, I'll bring this back, I'll do this because I want to show you where I'm at"
"627890","628670"," with the market, right?"
"629770","637690"," So I posted this on Twitter this morning and we'll look at a monthly chart here and you can see,"
"637950","641450"," you can see if there's a few key things to see on this chart that I'm showing here."
"642690","646810"," Hold on here, I want to clear, hold on a second because I can't see that on your, on my"
"646810","647650"," end I'm seeing some different."
"648270","655710"," Okay, so the key thing for me is that we know that we're in still in an upward trend here. "
"655890","657630"," You have to respect that, okay?"
"659350","662630"," You know we're selling the top of the trend up here, right?"
"662810","664930"," These are the major channel that we're in."
"665430","667690"," So, is it still viable to trade up here?"
"667950","668070"," Sure."
"669430","670490"," What do I want to buy?"
"670690","671570"," I want to buy down here. "
"671790","676550"," See this little green, this little green thing, I want to buy that, but I want to buy down here"
"676550","676790"," somewhere."
"678690","682210"," I'd love to buy the bottom of this and I'd like to buy the bottom of this because there's another"
"682210","686670"," smaller channel, there's another smaller channel within a channel, right?"
"686830","688510"," You see that smaller channel that's in here too."
"689410","691610"," So I can buy in safety down here, right?"
"691750","692770"," I can buy in safety here. "
"692770","694450"," I can buy in safety here."
"695490","699970"," Now if you're a bear, you know that you're already trying to sell this down, right?"
"701070","706850"," With no huge committal, this morning Peru put out a post saying we should, we should buy, we should"
"706850","709930"," ricochet off here and start selling heavy."
"711590","715570"," The government's planned scheming of windfall profit from a, I'm going to pause that. "
"715930","722750"," So, so that was his point this morning."
"722750","729350"," Right up here, we could actually roll over, but still break out up here, I should be, be clarified."
"729810","732690"," There's some real room for up and down in this move up, move higher. "
"734950","741090"," Now, my point though is this, if you're a bearish here, I respect being bearish to here, but then"
"741090","745890"," I'd want you to pull off and check, you'd want to see like, you'd want to see the trade down,"
"746270","752190"," a breakthrough, right, a retest, and then the next move lower, right?"
"752190","758410"," So you'd take that next trade lower, and then with confidence, you'd short the market here into,"
"758410","762850"," you know, December, January, March, whatever, you want to see this break here."
"763590","767730"," Now if you don't see that break and you're a bear and you want to go full on bear, then"
"767730","768990"," your real target is up here."
"769470","773390"," You want to see us trade above to the larger downtrend from the beginning of the year in January,"
"774370","779430"," right, couple tests down here and then take that trade way lower, that makes sense to you. "
"779430","783670"," Or at least take it to here and then jump back at it with commitment down here."
"784270","789410"," So I'd be like a two, I'd be like a two move, right, you'd see one, two or two rejections,"
"789510","794610"," you'd take that move down, get out of your position, and then with confidence short into January or"
"794610","794810"," March."
"795270","799150"," So there's a bunch of different choices that, you know, choose your own adventures here even as a"
"799150","799330"," bear. "
"800970","805390"," If you're a bull, for me, for me taking trades, I always like to win."
"805610","807790"," So I'm not interested in this right here."
"807790","810370"," I'm not interested in this grind up here. "
"810450","816230"," If anything, I'm interested in shorting this down, shorting that down, or buying a dip down here or"
"816230","820130"," buying a dip down here, if that helps you out at all with your trade plan."
"820490","824910"," So for me, I've got nothing for you today in terms of where I think the market goes."
"825610","827950"," Likely the market is down from here. "
"828250","837830"," Even if we, my point this morning in my post was, let's say we squeeze up here, right, we are,"
"837870","841410"," is safer for me than this little bit right here."
"842150","844250"," So I'm not interested in trading this at all today."
"845550","846930"," I want the safety of the trade. "
"847090","851690"," I want to take a trade and be like, yeah, I've got high confidence conviction in this trade."
"851990","861010"," So it's not meeting my high conviction confidence to take this last leg up higher."
"863590","864050"," Okay. "
"864050","869450"," So with all that said and done, we're going to go back to the one day on the one minute"
"869450","869750"," chart."
"871910","874110"," Yeah, we'll go back to a one minute chart of the day."
"875550","882450"," Let's hear about it back in one minute so you guys can get that there for you so you guys"
"882450","883890"," can actually trade this for the day. "
"884190","884690"," There's our three."
"888790","889470"," We're right there."
"889590","891050"," We'll bring back up book map for you. "
"895290","895930"," Hold on here."
"895990","897590"," I got some some funkiness I got to do."
"899210","904690"," And this will show you, at least for today's trading plan, what's going on. "
"904790","910310"," If you missed what I just said, pause the broadcast, go back and just watch what I just talked to"
"910310","916350"," you about and then catch back up, refresh your page and catch back up to the live stream."
"917530","922150"," Let me see if I can get this looking nice for you guys so you can see the actual moves"
"922150","922990"," throughout the day."
"924670","925610"," Right about there. "
"929730","931610"," So you guys, you guys, I'll copy in this."
"933170","937250"," Oh, me, I'm not from Texas, but I have lived down with Texans."
"937610","944070"," I was in the military, so I have a really mixed, I fear it's a context. "
"944450","946750"," It's a syntax to my speech."
"948030","953130"," If I've been drinking, you all sound like I'm from Boston, but I've lived all over the place."
"953350","956450"," So I picked up different, different syntaxes. "
"956670","957150"," I've lived everywhere."
"957630","962330"," I've spent most of my adult life, my profession, I mostly moved a lot from my profession."
"963250","969570"," I was, I would help companies that were failing to not fail any longer. "
"969750","974150"," I would come in as a team and you pay, you pay me to turn your company around or make"
"974150","976430"," sure your company didn't go bankrupt."
"979730","984910"," So Tesla, yeah, I can go over Tesla here if you want real quick, or hold on, let me see"
"984910","990070"," I can bring it up on another instance here and in the background, let me bring up a, hold on"
"990070","994670"," a second here, give me just a second and I'll review Tesla with you."
"999390","1000930"," You guys want to hear Tesla, do Tesla. "
"1003550","1005070"," Team has, we're focusing on Tesla."
"1005410","1011370"," There goes the cell on Tesla, I posted this morning, right, I said, it's kind of funny."
"1016420","1026280"," Okay, so we'll look at Tesla real quick, let me just a second here, just a second, I'll bring Tesla"
"1026280","1026900"," up for you. "
"1029599","1032700"," Okay, so let's look at Tesla on a larger timeframe here, okay."
"1035060","1037640"," So Tesla is in a downtrend, we know that, right?"
"1040430","1045510"," Talk to you about, I talked to you a few times, Larry Williams has said this as well."
"1045950","1052570"," Tesla can decouple from tech and we've seen that decoupling another tech stocks as well. "
"1052850","1058150"," Tech could actually come back and Tesla would continue a downward path into January or March."
"1058680","1067990"," So be careful of being stuck on, being stuck on, Tesla has to follow"
"1067990","1069830"," tech and all that kind of stuff."
"1070090","1076190"," I've posted in the past instances where Tesla has decoupled and you can on your own look and see"
"1076190","1077370"," that Tesla has decoupled. "
"1077670","1082330"," There's only a few tickers left in tech that have not repriced themselves if we do make a move."
"1083130","1086710"," Now, when you see moves like this, right, you see this big move down here, right?"
"1087390","1090190"," And you regain 50% of that move, right?"
"1090350","1093410"," You got another move down if we regain 50% of that move."
"1093970","1098490"," So can Tesla come back to one night and I was talking this morning about maybe 193 down the road?"
"1098870","1102970"," You might catch that 193 on that next move higher, okay?"
"1103470","1108070"," This move might not be done going up, but you're literally looking to buy a bounce down here to"
"1108070","1109390"," take that last bit of the move. "
"1109750","1111430"," So yeah, can we go to 191 more times?"
"1111650","1111750"," Sure."
"1112050","1114090"," Do I think the Tesla's done going down?"
"1114390","1114730"," Fuck no."
"1114730","1119670"," And for Tesla, not to go to be done going down, it needs to break out of that channel and"
"1119670","1123570"," then resume higher for you to get long-term bullish on Tesla again. "
"1123950","1125230"," Know that as a Tesla bull."
"1125630","1131930"," If you're out there saying the retrace is over on Tesla, you can't say that until you break out of"
"1131930","1134630"," the downward trend, consolidate and make a move higher."
"1134890","1135530"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"1135730","1137590"," You can't do it until that happens. "
"1138170","1138510"," Nobody can."
"1138670","1142210"," There's nobody out there with a crystal ball saying it's done with Tesla."
"1142670","1143270"," This is bottom. "
"1143270","1149170"," And if they are saying that the technicals do not agree with you in any way, shape or form."
"1149590","1150810"," So you want to see that, okay?"
"1151850","1156570"," So what I want you to say, so if you're a Tesla bull, what I want you to know is"
"1156570","1160650"," on a smaller time frame here, what are we looking for on a smaller time frame?"
"1161370","1167130"," Okay, we're going to be looking for, we already just broke."
"1167510","1170410"," So this is a five minute chart, it's got a 15 minute chart, right?"
"1170970","1173750"," And this is what most traders trade 15 minute charts, right?"
"1174190","1174910"," So let's look at Tesla. "
"1175490","1177050"," You want to see, right?"
"1177230","1181730"," You want to see, so we have the 600% up here, and then 193 above, let's look at that"
"1181730","1181970"," 193."
"1182430","1184590"," If you want that, see that green line right there?"
"1185490","1187150"," See that 193 over here?"
"1188030","1189330"," We'll wait to see that on the chart, right?"
"1189950","1192570"," We want to see where that roll should come in down the road, right?"
"1192890","1194530"," We're looking forward right now, right?"
"1196150","1198830"," We want to see at least on a 15 minute chart."
"1199550","1200790"," No break of it, right?"
"1200970","1204990"," We want to see, see this white line right here, this green line, this blue line. "
"1205330","1208830"," You want to see some kind of a capture and move higher, okay?"
"1209310","1212730"," This is what you want to see for Tesla gang."
"1213110","1218830"," Now, if you can get over here and keep moving higher, we'll discuss that down the road if Tesla"
"1218830","1222010"," gets back in line and starts to regain itself."
"1222370","1226150"," But for right now, if you're a bull, the only thing you're looking for here is you're looking for"
"1226150","1228810"," some kind of a dip buy, then move into that 193. "
"1230690","1231950"," That's what you want to be seeing."
"1231950","1233050"," This move right here."
"1233470","1242570"," So put your blinders on, don't be listening to people on Twitter and on fucking CNBC and don't be"
"1242570","1246350"," listening to like Tesla Q, Tesla bulls, don't bother. "
"1246790","1251190"," Your next fight is right here, trading this up to 193."
"1251190","1257510"," You want to talk about higher than 193, then you have to retake, you have to break out from this"
"1257510","1261430"," downward trend here for Tesla."
"1261890","1264370"," Until that happens, don't be listening to anybody. "
"1265050","1270170"," And for Tesla bears out there, I wouldn't be huge short here until we get up here."
"1270630","1273290"," If bears really want to be getting crazy, it's over here."
"1274750","1278270"," So right now, the ball is in the bull's court to buy a dip down here. "
"1278750","1281590"," This is where the, this is where the, the ball, right?"
"1281710","1283590"," And so we sold this, the bears sold this, right?"
"1283690","1285190"," Or long sold this."
"1285550","1287530"," And now longs are looking to buy down here."
"1288510","1293470"," If they can buy this down here, the bulls are in charge down, down here for sure. "
"1293630","1295470"," At this moment, bulls are in charge."
"1295990","1300250"," It's a matter of risk for you to buy down here as a bull and trade this up."
"1300930","1301930"," Bears are still not in charge. "
"1302170","1304190"," If you want to know the answer, they're not in charge."
"1304190","1310770"," This is a moment for bulls to buy another dip, run it up, and then it, then for the bulls"
"1310770","1315450"," to take, or the bears to take over, if the bears want to take over, it's definitely up here"
"1315450","1315690"," somewhere."
"1316410","1322430"," Because when the bears want to step in and take over, okay, I call them bears, but these are"
"1322430","1326230"," algorithms and not really bear, not really retail bears. "
"1326570","1328150"," It says all to do with algorithms and banks."
"1329910","1333850"," So in banks in their positioning and where they want to buy the dip and the real dip and all"
"1333850","1334370"," that kind of stuff."
"1334950","1342950"," So just be conscious of Tesla over the, over the coming days and weeks or whatever. "
"1343230","1346570"," And think about your risk appetite, where you want to buy the next dip on Tesla."
"1347610","1348510"," Does that help you guys?"
"1348690","1351390"," If you're looking at Tesla, hold on here."
"1353090","1354290"," Is that helping you guys out there?"
"1356850","1358310"," Hey, Dan, good to see you as well. "
"1359270","1360770"," So I covered Tesla for you."
"1361510","1367790"," So today I have, I'm work today, tomorrow, Sunday, I'm working on getting the stream, getting a"
"1367790","1373650"," better news service for the stream, getting a better version of book map for you guys, the very"
"1373650","1379550"," expensive version, and getting a legit newsletter out to you guys every single week."
"1380510","1385770"," But on by least Sunday, if not Saturday, I'd like to get it out after Saturday, Sunday futures"
"1385770","1391930"," open, so I can get you better technicals heading into the rest of the week for you. "
"1392250","1393510"," It's, you know, it's really weird."
"1393690","1396590"," It's hard with what's difficult to getting a newsletter out."
"1396930","1403390"," The best newsletter you could put out would be after 9am on a Monday, because you've got resets in"
"1403390","1404790"," the Greeks for the week. "
"1406190","1407670"," But people want it on Sunday."
"1408010","1408830"," So I don't know."
"1408890","1411190"," We'll talk about that later on. "
"1412250","1414730"," Down the road, if you prefer, I'll put them out on Sundays."
"1415910","1421710"," And if they're not doing well over the course of a week, maybe we'll shift it to a Monday morning"
"1421710","1422290"," type deal."
"1422750","1424090"," I'll put place markers in. "
"1424310","1430370"," And if we get a wild swing on Sunday futures, either up or down, maybe maybe a, maybe a switch"
"1430370","1435750"," to a month to a Monday update at least every week or something like that, because there are"
"1435750","1438370"," technical things, not technical."
"1438650","1444670"," There are, there's data sets that come out on Mondays that are important."
"1444670","1446730"," For you, for a weekly timeframe. "
"1449820","1450880"," Good morning to all you guys."
"1451080","1452300"," So this is up for you."
"1452640","1456460"," I'm going to put the news back on for you here so you can hear the news. "
"1457460","1461680"," Expect some ramp in what the stream is going to be."
"1461940","1463960"," And we're also going to do a bunch of interviewing and stuff like that."
"1464040","1468180"," We've got interviews lined up coming down the road for you on slow trade days, stuff like that. "
"1468740","1470780"," We guys have your, your levels set for the day."
"1471860","1475340"," You've got where the big sellers are for the day, where the dip buys are on the day."
"1476340","1478000"," This should help you trade the rest of today. "
"1478300","1484780"," And if, if you are just joining us earlier in the broadcast, I went over my view on the markets"
"1485440","1492580"," on a larger timeframe chart, a one month chart to give you a larger picture of, of my thoughts on"
"1492580","1494180"," where the market is, where the market's going."
"1494980","1498840"," That, that should encapsulate for all of you without even having a weekly newsletter."
"1499760","1501740"," That should encapsulate my view on the market right now. "
"1503480","1511480"," And if you have a chance, take a look at my public, Twitter handle, Captain, just Google search me,"
"1511520","1512120"," Captain Jim James."
"1512180","1513960"," They posted about Dixie this morning."
"1514900","1523920"," And that post about Dixie is correlating that we, you know, you got people saying the 2000 crash,"
"1524360","1528080"," 2007 crash, we have way more down to go. "
"1528760","1533000"," And there are other, not just Dixie, but there are other indicators."
"1534200","1538440"," They're more consistent that are saying that we are in a localized bottom."
"1538440","1540340"," That last 350 tap we had. "
"1541520","1546200"," And then possibly another test of 350 and even 3200 into March."
"1546220","1549020"," It's like over a six month period, it might be bottoming."
"1550000","1552360"," And Dixie's Dixie's showing that as well. "
"1553600","1560320"," There's, there's some, and then what's neat about that post about Dixie is, if you see Dixie break"
"1560320","1567100"," any time, break down, any time around this price level we're at on Dixie, it would confirm that"
"1567100","1567340"," bottom."
"1567860","1575060"," If we find huge support here right at 106 or so, it would confirm that we're not bottomed yet."
"1575520","1581940"," Now, there are other indicators I talked to you guys last week about unemployment showing if we're"
"1581940","1585540"," going to roll the market over so you can start getting a toolbox together. "
"1585540","1588780"," I talked to you about if we break 10,000 on NDX, right?"
"1589140","1595020"," So you can make, make yourself on your own time, a little checklist as I roll this stuff out to"
"1595020","1595220"," you."
"1595600","1600440"," You can say, yeah, Cap talked about if we break 10,000 on NDX, we'll see 6500."
"1601040","1606260"," Cap said, look at unemployment figures for when the market truly rolls over. "
"1606740","1610420"," Cap said, hey, look at Dixie and what it wants to hold."
"1610980","1615540"," If it finds support at 106 or if it starts to break down from that 106, what to expect out"
"1615540","1615860"," of the market."
"1615980","1617080"," Start looking at these indicators. "
"1617700","1622920"," We'll add them all up as we head into March and see it should give us some kind of a"
"1622920","1627600"," lead into where on a macro sense where the market's actually heading."
"1628560","1629420"," Make sense, guys?"
"1634460","1635760"," Right on Tony Chase."
"1636680","1638800"," So I'll be tuning in with you guys. "
"1638860","1644300"," If we have any huge moves today, I'll try to get back on live with you guys throughout the day."
"1644300","1646740"," If it's possible, if I have the time."
"1647460","1648580"," Otherwise, have a great Friday. "
"1649420","1652180"," If you can, I would say, don't trade today."
"1652460","1658240"," I would say, get off the internet, take this nice long weekend, recharge your batteries."
"1658640","1664480"," We have the whole month of, we've got J-Pow coming out, we've got the whole month of December into"
"1664480","1667380"," the holidays and to Kwanza and Hanukkah and Christmas. "
"1669240","1674740"," So we've got some, if you were to take a breather today, today and Saturday, Saturday, Sunday is"
"1674740","1675420"," probably it."
"1675960","1677800"," That's a happy Thanksgiving to you out there."
"1677860","1680480"," If you celebrate it, if you don't, happy long weekend. "
"1682800","1685460"," I'll post the Discord link right now, okay?"
"1686160","1688820"," We're all attempt to post the Discord link right now."
"1702550","1708090"," Yeah, so I've run different computers on the stream and on this stream, I don't have a Discord"
"1708090","1708510"," link."
"1709190","1716090"," So what I'll do is on a different computer, I will, I don't know if I can't, what I'll do"
"1716090","1721930"," is on a different computer, I'm going to post the Discord link publicly on Captain Jim James'"

"1730150","1730370"," join."
"1731050","1734090"," It's good for one day, you won't be able to go back and use it in a day or two."
"1734550","1740210"," So I'm going to check out right now, I'm going to post it publicly on Twitter and you guys all"
"1740210","1740770"," have a great weekend. "
"1740770","1743610"," I'll see you guys on Sunday."
"1744310","1749010"," You can see a squeeze is happening right now on Bookman app."
"1749130","1751690"," Hopefully we get that rip higher today. "
"1753170","1758370"," Take it easy guys, guys and girls, whatever, lays they, them, whatever you guys are, whatever you"
"1758370","1760530"," guys identify, I will be checking in with you later."
"1864590","1867850"," All right, I just posted that on Captain Jim James."

"1878170","1881670"," just Google searched me and you'll find me. "
"1882290","1887010"," That's the best way to find me without, there's some, there's some scammers out there that try to"
"1888070","1890270"," pretend that they're me on the internet, they're not me."

"4258930","4259590"," would you just wait?"
"4260090","4261790"," Why would you buy the 59 on the put spread?"
"4263550","4264370"," What is the rationale?"
"4265490","4268050"," There's a good question on that."
"4268630","4270310"," You could do anything that you wanted. "
"4271610","4277070"," You do a put spread on much lower numbers, right?"
"4277970","4283510"," Or the rationale behind that put spread was, well, let's start the beginning."
"4283670","4291450"," So Peru is pretty much saying that we should keep bouncing down off of the 200 day moving average."
"4292050","4295250"," And he was relating it back to 2000 to 2002. "
"4298740","4304640"," And so I went back and looked at the chart pattern for 2000 to 2002."
"4306240","4311520"," And overlaid it over the decline that began January 4th, 2022."
"4313120","4317500"," And so the implication is, and I'm not saying that this can't happen. "
"4318220","4322420"," Even Dixie, if Dixie was the reverse course, we could go into that major decline."
"4323660","4329320"," But some of the arguments that are out there, Mike Bari, perfect example, are stating that we're"
"4329320","4334120"," following what happened in 2000."
"4334740","4340900"," So the implication would be that we're going to crash into March. "
"4342480","4350780"," And it's going to follow a similar pattern to 2000 to the 2000 or 2002 decline."
"4351860","4353340"," That this is not a localized bottom."
"4354080","4361980"," So if we're playing chart patterns or not chart patterns, but candlestick patterns, the bottom is"
"4361980","4364940"," implied to be at about 2,600, 2,500. "
"4365380","4369880"," So if you were to just catch the roll at 405 or so, this is before a market opens."
"4370080","4374180"," So if you were to wait, let's say to put that spread on, and so whatever the top is, and"
"4374180","4385660"," this in this trade higher, let's say it's at 406 or 420 or whatever the fuck it is, so"
"4385660","4387840"," you could still trade that spread down."
"4389540","4397060"," It would be it implies a 28% move down into, I believe, he's saying March. "
"4398060","4406260"," Now the chart pattern shows 2024, I think, as being the that bottom, not March, but his implication"
"4406260","4409440"," was we'll see a bloodbath in 2023."
"4409960","4414680"," So I was trying to relate it more towards or more geared towards what his implication was."
"4414740","4417100"," We're going to have a crash in early 2023. "
"4422950","4424290"," I don't see that happening."
"4425070","4427810"," I'm not I'm not going to take that trade either."
"4429850","4437030"," Or maybe he was implying we go to 3,500 or 3,200, then 2,900 or 2,600, I"
"4437030","4438210"," think it was 2,590. "
"4440290","4444750"," The market's not implying the dealers don't think we're going there in March."
"4445970","4448270"," So that was the only reason I posted that."
"4448370","4449170"," I wouldn't take that trade. "
"4450050","4454530"," I don't I think that the I think that I don't even I don't even think that the mark Mike"
"4454530","4459170"," Barry trade is is the Mike Barry trade like you don't know how short I am."
"4459250","4463690"," He could be short down to 3,500, pull it off and say I got mine, or you know I"
"4463690","4470170"," closed out it'll tell you three months later that he closed out so he can make that statement and"
"4470170","4479830"," kind of be right to an extent to all the down to 3,500 or even 3,200, but the"
"4479830","4485950"," implication is that we crash crash like we're going to have this nasty crash down into 2023."
"4486230","4487590"," I don't think we get to see the crash. "
"4487790","4489310"," I agree with Larry on that."
"4490250","4493670"," I've been stating that for weeks months probably a month though."
"4494310","4495470"," I think I'll lay back to September. "
"4495470","4501930"," October 8th maybe October 8th early September I was saying that timing is not right."
"4503490","4511330"," But I still believe that I still want to see the timing isn't right for unemployment numbers."
"4513390","4515870"," So you kind of want all the ducks to match up. "
"4517350","4525830"," And if those ducks aren't there you kind of the other thing too is you do it is people say"
"4525830","4529190"," it's not bearish if the Fed pauses or Fed lowers rates."
"4529210","4532530"," It is bearish but we haven't seen that yet either."
"4532650","4538030"," So we haven't seen like these major things to say we're crashing that nasty at this point. "
"4539730","4545390"," If anything some of the numbers or some of the data points are saying that this is a bottom."
"4548640","4551700"," You know why it's better than let's say 400."
"4552400","4556600"," Well I think so when you do that debit put spread it starts printing. "
"4559040","4564680"," It'll print some of the it'll print some of the trade from any let's say we trade down a 350."
"4565600","4569840"," It'll let's say as we trade on a 3500 that print it'll still print."
"4570820","4574920"," So the trade prints will keep adding money as we go down and decline. "
"4575460","4579900"," So let's say we stop at 350 or 3200 320 into March."
"4580760","4583380"," You would still be able to capture percentage of that trade."
"4583660","4586220"," You wouldn't capture all of it but you would still be in the green. "
"4586640","4591520"," So that's what the idea behind the spread is as long as we go below trade lower it doesn't have"
"4591520","4593260"," to actually tag 259 either."
"4593600","4597320"," They could just tag like from 3200 to 3500 and it would still print."
"4598060","4599360"," Not a ton but it would print. "
"4600980","4603200"," But this is for the for doomers out there."
"4603300","4607860"," There's a lot of there's some doomers out there that are claiming that the market's going to crash."
"4607860","4610600"," Although I'm not saying that I disagree with them. "
"4611500","4621680"," I'm saying that it's not statistically or in a probability sense the right trade for"
"4621680","4626140"," right now as we head into this key resistance at this downward channel."
"4626360","4632780"," At 11 a.m. Eastern time we get Canadian budget balance prior minus two spot four five billion."
"4633820","4635120"," I'm going to turn that down a little bit. "
"4635400","4641140"," You'd want to see you'd want to trade it to confirmation to the legs to each level right."
"4641260","4643740"," You'd want to see us reverse on the large channel."
"4643780","4647820"," You'd want to break break below then this channel we're in. "
"4648800","4652060"," And then take it down to the bottom of the downward channel."
"4652380","4657460"," And then if you think we're going to like 2,900 or some nonsense like that 2,600 you'd reenter"
"4657460","4658860"," the trade once more at that point."
"4659880","4662020"," You just take it step by step down. "
"4662780","4669220"," And as a matter of fact if you do that right just looking at the decline this year it would"
"4669220","4669960"," make sense right."
"4670220","4675300"," If you were to look at the decline for 2023 or 2022 you would enter the top of the top"
"4675300","4682500"," of the trend you know shorted or by puts and you'd end at the bottom of the channel roughly not"
"4682500","4685480"," the full channel because we haven't hit it exact each time."
"4688100","4692580"," So it's like the it's the meat of the trade in the middle is where the money is at. "
"4692840","4696680"," It doesn't seem like the top of the key or the bottom of the key is where the money is"
"4696680","4696840"," at."
"4697760","4699540"," And it hasn't been like that all this year."
"4699960","4707640"," And I think that's the idea and that brings up another subject which is what does a bear need to"
"4707640","4708320"," make it profitable. "
"4708900","4713660"," So there I'll I'll pause it this I'll pause it this to you hold on a second here."
"4716380","4724080"," Oh because this is just a mind I realize it allows you to actually hear order flame futures forex"
"4724080","4728040"," and stock instruments get a free trial at tickstrike.com."
"4728120","4729720"," Let me see if I bring this up on a different chart here."
"4729800","4733060"," Give me just a second here one more more depth. "
"4742740","4743720"," This is a good one."
"4749420","4760470"," Okay so you have to look at this too from the perspective of we"
"4760470","4767870"," have this we have a pretty significant decline here right."
"4769110","4781700"," And I guess the thought process would be let's"
"4781700","4785640"," say you come up and over and we roll down and retest this 350 that would be like the third"
"4785640","4787320"," time right one two and three. "
"4788700","4794900"," Four you have this last little capitulation move and that's your three right."
"4795780","4801340"," So you'd have that this will be in one being two and then your third one let's say it goes"
"4801340","4802120"," down to 3200."
"4803200","4806060"," That's that that this goes against everything in the bear case. "
"4808240","4811960"," So that's that's positive number one like 3200 is not good enough right."
"4813360","4814260"," Does that make sense."
"4817040","4820100"," But you do get but if you're a bully or like you got my one I got my two I"
"4820100","4823640"," got my three my like this is my and winds up being my capitulation move. "
"4824280","4826820"," Sometimes in March we could actually bring it back here or someone like this."
"4829860","4830780"," Something like that."
"4831640","4837680"," Okay you want two and you're three and this so this is like one thin red bar down and you're"
"4837680","4841440"," off and running but this was your bottom so if you're looking back in time you're like shit I"
"4841440","4844980"," missed that bottom being formed that makes any sense to you guys out there. "
"4845500","4853320"," Now the one problem we're running into as we roll this over is the one major problem for the bear"
"4853320","4856360"," case is this isn't good enough right."
"4857960","4865520"," You need like that death nail in their view they need this you need that because it becomes less"
"4865520","4868980"," profitable right if you had this major decline here."
"4871140","4877640"," This is very profitable here right this major decline so they need this this this other major"
"4877640","4884380"," decline they need more right it's always more more more and that that's for bulls too you know you"
"4884380","4891200"," because what you don't want to do is get bulls thinking about oh this is a bottom because you could"
"4891200","4898840"," just start buying in here and you'd be good until like 2025 let's say and I think that's what my"
"4898840","4904660"," positive is that the timing is not right with companies going bankrupt timing is not right with let"
"4904660","4909530"," me see they can shoot you this way. "
"4910650","4916230"," So if you're attempting for those three levels which you start to do the percentages right right"
"4916230","4923450"," you're like what's the percentage chance we get down here it's pretty good what's the percentage"
"4923450","4929950"," chance or actually I should say this 3,500 was actually like Eastern time we get Canadian budget"
"4929950","4937730"," balance prior minus two spot four five billion this 3,500 was a high percentage trade this was like"
"4937730","4942630"," a like I think it was like back in January we ran the numbers on this it was like a"
"4943290","4953090"," 85% chance it was hitting 350 320 became becomes like a 50% to 35% chance and"
"4953090","4963010"," then you get like 15% chance down here hold on here it is ideally a 15 "
"4963010","4971110","% chance is somewhere down in here and you get a like a three to five percent chance that sorry"
"4971110","4980190"," that you're anywhere below this number which is that how you come down to this 1600 is how do you"
"4980190","4988350"," find that 1600 and this is all based on time two is or this how the bears are buying that"
"4988350","4997150"," 1600 is they're looking for that for this one right here I think it's this one right here"
"4997150","5005250"," somewhere right down there this is what they want this this tag down below if you see this how this"
"5005250","5012170"," is heading down that's why I'm talking to you about this 1600 on spy you guys can see that I"
"5012170","5018710"," don't know they want that bloodbath at the end now the problem here is the percentages go down for"
"5018710","5026070"," that further decline as we as we trade down here and for the chance of it even happening and then"
"5026070","5032870"," you don't want to see bulls get dip buying happy right because they will as we trade down here"
"5032870","5039950"," bulls we want to buy it now just the timing of what's going on in our economy makes you wonder"
"5039950","5047750"," or even Dixie Dixie says we're at a bottom just saying is flashing that we're at but let's just say"
"5047750","5054750"," we get that March that that March buy right then it's a bounce here or even a bounce down here"
"5054750","5065500"," at that 3200 and employment still strong let's say employment's still strong and we've"
"5065500","5072020"," done the damage let's say we've done the damage with we've done the damage in the economy we've"
"5072020","5081080"," done the damage to companies but we're not going to until we actually actually realize"
"5081080","5086560"," that economic destruction and that would take us into 2025 this is what Larry Williams is talking"
"5086560","5093880"," about he's talking about us heading up again into 2025 and then a slow rollover at some kind of an"
"5093880","5102360"," all-time high I don't know if this is this chart's not showing it but I guess in your imagination"
"5102360","5109460"," you could somewhat see a move higher and then in 2025 we actually get the big roll down and you"
"5109460","5116640"," see like you know Jim Bob and Mikey Billy and Mary Sue all lose you know and it's kind of"
"5116640","5121400"," neat too because you'd start to see people's cars I went I was had this thought this week I was"
"5121400","5128680"," looking up a story that had some comments on it about car values and when they're going to let's"
"5128680","5134420"," say you get everybody losing their jobs the housing values have come down enough mortgages have"
"5134420","5138660"," come down people are ready to sell for a new home let's say they've grown into a new home and"
"5138660","5144800"," can't afford it right now everyone's just bought all their homes so let's say three to five years"
"5144800","5149960"," from now people are growing out of them or aging out of them and the housing market's still too"
"5149960","5154780"," high for the buy-in to jobs start to become scarce it's like the timing every time I see this"
"5154780","5161640"," v-cube of the timing right the jobs start to become more and more scarce people are laying off that"
"5161640","5166120"," kind of stuff and they can't afford a car and then if they own a new house and let's say"
"5166120","5171740"," they're going to buy a new vehicle and vehicle prices are still out of control and they're like"
"5171740","5174920"," okay I'm gonna go back and buy this new truck and now I can't afford a hundred thousand dollar"
"5174920","5181020"," truck in my hundred thousand dollar truck that I bought before is now worthless that makes that"
"5181020","5188040"," sense to get that big roll and it's what's crazy is the bears would still more than likely or you"
"5188040","5196500"," know that bear concept would still you get that huge decline they would still not get that doom"
"5196500","5202720"," that's portrayed right that you'd end up seeing and this is what Larry's pointed at the end of his"
"5202720","5209520"," video was right for decades I've heard them talk about this and so it's like out of your grasp"
"5209520","5214340"," right for the next three to five years you end up or the next three years let's say in 2025"
"5214340","5222960"," whatever decline that would be they never act we never actually broke that 3200 level and so this"
"5222960","5229320"," would snatch minus two spot one six billion minus two spot one six billion this would this would"
"5229320","5236380"," snatch out of the hands of bears that full death that full death and destruction that they're"
"5236380","5245220"," looking for and that I think that was the point he was trying to make that Larry was trying to"
"5245220","5251440"," make and I think that's part of the point of you really between now and March you really want to"
"5251440","5258860"," put your blinders onto both bowls and bears that are Perma on this just a continuation but keep"
"5258860","5264750"," your eye on the prize of this is the prize to be looking for as some kind of a reversal"
"5264750","5273430"," coming into March either here or here I'm not really concerned about this right here this happening"
"5273430","5281430"," if it presents itself I'll take it up but I'm looking at some instead of this nasty Perma bear and"
"5281430","5288050"," instead of this nasty Perma bull it's kind of like that middle of the road trade somewhere in there"
"5288050","5294290"," coming into the start of the year and it makes rational sense and you know I would say this if"
"5294290","5301290"," you're if if I'm if I was looking for this kind of a bloodbath down here we still haven't seen"
"5301290","5306790"," what was going to cause that it has to be there it has to be some things happening and those"
"5306790","5312310"," things haven't presented themselves yet so this is about found to change to if those if those"
"5312310","5319710"," things present themselves before we get there sure I'll jump right on I think that's why it's key"
"5319710","5329690"," here to until at least March look for or to trade the levels be prudent in in"
"5329690","5337290"," your what you're stating because right now Mike Barry's saying we're crashing the whole entire the"
"5337290","5341870"," whole system's crashing you know when it does crash like that in the past when it crashes like this"
"5343030","5352010"," there's you have like usually have months to years to get in on this part of this this new trade"
"5352010","5360230"," this new zone lower there's a ton of time there I think that also works itself out with with it"
"5360230","5370090"," with ndx oh hold on a second here it's the"
"5370090","5378350"," same thing on ndx you were looking for that bloodbath you are looking for you know that break of 10"
"5378350","5388050"," 000 right so if you want to start talking about market crashes and market collapses you kind of"
"5388050","5397400"," need this to happen and it hasn't happened yet otherwise you see that and this is a good good good"
"5397400","5402540"," way to look at it too I mean you want to start talking about this you don't know how short"
"5402540","5410080"," I'm shit I am he should be posting that shit like Barry should have post should post that shit like"
"5410080","5416840"," when we're like right here you don't know how short I am he should post that shit like right here"
"5419460","5424120"," you know it's it's not the right place for him to be posting that shit like you don't know how"
"5424120","5431960"," short I am should be like right fucking here he posts that as we start this move lower I think"
"5431960","5438700"," it's kind of fucking nonsense that he posted that shit because that would be the same as you know"
"5439460","5448100"," you don't know how short I am should have been tweeted here right and should be tweeted here does"
"5448100","5453800"," that make sense not fucking right here nobody gives a fuck about that stupid fucking post right"
"5453800","5461500"," here does that make sense so you're in a larger time frame level level not not not right fucking"
"5461500","5471920"," here it's fucking stupid sorry i don't know if they help you guys or not but that"
"5471920","5481850"," gets that gives you an idea of when you hear people post that shit why i mean"
"5481850","5490230"," i don't know why i don't i don't know i'm trying to figure out my brain sometimes why um he'll"
"5490230","5499200"," post that stuff publicly yeah he likes to get free coffee mugs yeah there are always levels in"
"5499200","5505040"," between so when you're looking at it like a five year 20 or 10 year and you're like yeah he's"
"5505040","5511060"," calling for fucking this calling for something that you know you don't call until you go down there"
"5511060","5516700"," you kind of want to like break through that first major level to be you don't know how short I"
"5516700","5526260"," am like come on berry if you were that short uh if you were that fucking short and then the"
"5526260","5536840"," other problem with that statement too is you as a let's do that chart one more time you"
"5536840","5546350"," as like a retail trader uh you as a you as a retail trader"
"5546350","5556150"," if you think for a minute that your broker is going to allow you to let's say"
"5556150","5563450"," even trade down to here and then absorb all this before it rolls down here you're going to get"
"5563450","5566930"," fucking you're going to get margin called they're going to take your everything your house your"
"5566930","5571250"," wife your kids and everything mike barry could go borrow fucking millions of dollars to stay in his"
"5571250","5577270"," position for the next three years if it doesn't work but you as a retail trader then it shouldn't"
"5577270","5584510"," happen so uh use some small some small trader think you're going to call up a fucking prime bank"
"5584510","5591990"," and be like you know just like the fucking movie you know it's always been wrong a lot too but"
"5591990","5598650"," most people are wrong a lot um even even barry's you know if when you look at that actual part"
"5598650","5604190"," what barry became famous for i'm gonna fuck i was wrong on that trade for like four or seven years"
"5604190","5611250"," something like that so think about that time frame that he has and the resources that he has to be"
"5611250","5622130"," right like eventually you'll be right yeah"
"5622130","5628350"," i just didn't like the tweet i thought the tweet was uh thought the tweet was a little too"
"5628350","5637310"," bombastic so um and there's a lot of big big big big follower accounts that are you know there's"
"5637310","5640850"," some big they're big follower accounts that are saying melt melt straight up to the moon you got"
"5640850","5645230"," big follower accounts saying we're gonna crash and like mega crash and the last thing i want to"
"5645230","5649890"," talk to you about that is i think i mentioned it but i didn't i didn't harp on it and"
"5649890","5659550"," that is there's a ratio of potential profit for how much farther down we're"
"5659550","5669310"," actually gonna go to a swing higher does that make sense so so a bank uh"
"5669310","5680160"," what big money is going to look at or"
"5680160","5686440"," it can get greedy and be like well we're gonna go here someday oh wait a minute we probably meet"
"5686440","5694040"," this the big bank can be like yeah we want to be here someday down in here uh but we"
"5694040","5702580"," just had this beautiful you know we just made bank down to here let's say right so let's uh let's"
"5702580","5708480"," do a 50% retracement to raise 60% retracement of the whole move and then we'll send it down"
"5708480","5716680"," later you know a year or two down the road into 2025 see if they're if they're manipulating this"
"5716680","5724080"," market if the fed's manipulating the market if the bank sir here's the bank's fucked up so bad back"
"5724080","5730500"," in 2007 and if they're you know if they're having private meetings with the fed and with the"
"5730500","5734380"," government and saying well you know we'll play balls who don't actually kill the market and have"
"5734380","5743140"," people in the streets with pitchforks and and uh you know torches and stuff we'll play this decline"
"5743140","5750680"," but we want to trade it you know they'll make this initial year move down you'll get a large"
"5750680","5756400"," retracement and then we'll make the final move down to a lower number in like 2025 that would be"
"5756400","5764940"," the manufacturer that's possible we've moved into an attempt doesn't mean they're going to be"
"5764940","5774260"," successful in it but it does mean that uh the application of a fucking Ponzi market would would"
"5774260","5780920"," mean that they're going to try to attempt to never have a 2007 again at least in in in the"
"5780920","5785640"," time where people are still alive that experienced it so yet maybe people that are like 50 to 80"
"5785640","5790820"," years old they're saying well we'll do as we'll manufacture this decline we'll spread it out over"
"5790820","5799220"," three to five years and we'll all play ball to it and you know what I mean so they're like"
"5799220","5803760"," so if they're playing ball on that they might look at an end of year decline here let's say it"
"5803760","5809300"," is down at 3500 or 3200 they might say uh we'll now trade it up and we'll capture this big"
"5809300","5816740"," move higher we'll catch everybody off sides and then we'll dump it again even deeper down to that"
"5816740","5822700"," 2900 level or whatever to that number is 2600 or whatever like in 2025 so you're just trying to"
"5822700","5830540"," think about the big players um how much manipulation uh comes in or is in the market currently from"
"5830540","5837260"," the Fed from banks um from the government in general and then there's some other things we don't"
"5837260","5841800"," know about we don't know how the election is going to go uh with the presidential election you're"
"5841800","5847020"," going to definitely see people coming out to run it reminds reminds me of the 80s with Reagan right"
"5847780","5853800"," if i'm not a republican just you know but let's say the republicans come out with uh it'd be easy"
"5853800","5860000"," for the republicans to run a candidate that's a populist let's heal everything that's heal a rift"
"5860000","5865180"," it's a no-brainer i mean everybody's like yeah it's gonna be just santas it's gonna be trump but"
"5865180","5870280"," the reality is i'm sure there's someone out there some planner that's saying we're gonna run a"
"5870280","5880200"," populist they called trump a populist but he really did divide people if you told uh bob and mary"
"5880200","5885180"," that you know what i'll do is i'll fix the economy and you know we'll do all this stuff you"
"5885180","5895000"," could see a repeat of the 80s and the market's gonna go to the f and moon right so it's"
"5895000","5900520"," a no-brainer that they would they would run something like that that's two years from that right uh"
"5900520","5908060"," that wasn't that run that that runs into uh 2024 so if those elections start ramping up and you"
"5908060","5913780"," start seeing uh even just the hint like if they fucking fart running a candidate like that and that"
"5913780","5918080"," candidate's out there stumping every day saying i'll fix the stock market i'll fix your pensions"
"5918080","5924280"," i'll fix your foreign foreign case you're going to see the banks will attempt to run up uh the"
"5924280","5930660"," market so we've got that we have the end of the war and uh you crane ahead of us still"
"5931160","5936240"," and as time passes that just creeps and creeps on a move higher so we have some catalysts down the"
"5936240","5955230"," road uh for for a nod to a bull run heading into uh 2024 2025 yeah"
"5955230","5957970"," so you guys want to look at what i'm trying to do i'll tell you what i'm trying to do"
"5961530","5968050"," and i'm on a long trade uh hold on i'll bring it up what do i want to see i"
"5968050","5976590"," want to we'll do it right now it's a good time to do it it's fucking slow-ass day do"
"5976590","5986450"," it right now do live uh"
"5986450","5994260"," this is basically what i'm looking for let's uh let's uh let's let's line it up let's set them up"
"5994260","6005280"," let's do it okay let's call this um um okay so"
"6005280","6019370"," this is uh march 31st right i want to buy a spread i put spread well"
"6019370","6024890"," i'm here or let me uh draw some boxes so we can i can publish the album and publish in"
"6024890","6038610"," this i think there's a high likelihood not think and i"
"6038610","6048610"," think there's a high likelihood uh that we let's see this here"
"6048610","6060090"," right and we'll just come back down here at some point between now and march at"
"6060090","6070030"," least here uh wait a minute you guys can't see that give me a second i think"
"6070030","6079930"," there's a high likelihood we come back down here at least to hear and march by march that's the"
"6079930","6087070"," minimum uh so what do i want to do or what i want to do is i want to wait"
"6087070","6099010"," until we hit hold"
"6099010","6122300"," on here let me get rid of that but i"
"6122300","6131740"," really want to do to is i want to buy somewhere at the top up here"
"6131740","6148230"," 412 406 412 somewhere in here oh"
"6148230","6157590"," i want to see somewhere right up in here i want to buy"
"6157590","6167460"," a a put spread"
"6167460","6174980"," and uh let me see if i can draw one up it's tough to draw one up uh without hitting"
"6174980","6184580"," this number here but uh let's just say we did a um 409 for let's say between 406"
"6184580","6194560"," and 412 and a 370p put a date of march 31st on it it's"
"6194560","6200720"," probably march 16th it's probably wherever the um let me look and see where that let me look at the"
"6200720","6219430"," um i want to say i'll get a better date for you let"
"6219430","6229430"," me get the opex calendar you want to tighten it up a little bit i guess uh 2023 opex"
"6229430","6239250"," calendar is march 17th so right"
"6239250","6244690"," there if you wanted to put the 31st on it in case they don't print it until after that would"
"6244690","6253530"," make sense but something like this i'd like to see some just like that uh seem right now bears are"
"6253530","6258710"," saying it's going to happen before december 15th right i think it's going to hit i guess it would"
"6258710","6267870"," print right if we did roll here and go straight down into december 15th and we nailed it you would"
"6267870","6276170"," uh you would print that you would print that um that put spread by december 15th if you were to"
"6276170","6285090"," buy it for march though it would give you the time that you needed to print now if it started"
"6285090","6291810"," hitting already you just close that closed that trade out you can even take more if you want to"
"6291810","6299570"," take more down here open up another put spread here but i think that's a really safe trade and the"
"6299570","6304990"," reason i like the more time on this trade is because uh the bulls bullish bets can be more"
"6304990","6311270"," irrational longer typically than a bearish bets they can usually stay up higher longer but bear"
"6311270","6317730"," bets usually come straight down then we bounce so uh i like more time on put spreads than i do"
"6317730","6324350"," on call spreads it tends to be not always but tends to be more more irrational longer on a bullish"
"6324350","6331790"," bet than on a bearish bet so i think that's a pretty safe bet it's not you know hundred percent"
"6331790","6339090"," guaranteed gonna print but it's fairly fairly good fairly good bet to bet this into march um and"
"6339090","6345110"," you're not asking that much in this trade it's not really that much of an ask to think that you"
"6345110","6356290"," know we're gonna have at least something like this at some point does that make sense or no uh"
"6356290","6362170"," and i would wait for this trade where i'm waiting for this trade until we at least get up let's"
"6362170","6367590"," see that's got the the price is going to change as time passes but it's somewhere up in here right"
"6367590","6377430"," like today it's about 408 if we hit 408 i'm going to put that trade on and the cool"
"6377430","6383510"," part about that trade too is if we break above and make this slingshot higher you're still going to"
"6383510","6387670"," get a roll at some point and be able to print that trade does that make sense so you wouldn't"
"6387670","6392790"," sell this trade you would you would dive in hand it if it went the wrong way against you you"
"6392790","6400110"," would diamond hand it right into march uh and see if this would print into the 31st so it's this"
"6400110","6404310"," is the one these are the trades like with the trades down here the trade the trades up here and"
"6404310","6409230"," the trades down here what you do is you place that trade on a different uh account or a different"
"6409230","6415090"," brokerage that you don't look at and you set sells that you sell set a sell price on it and"
"6415090","6422470"," you just don't fucking look at it set an alert for your um for your email your phone or whatever"
"6422470","6427510"," you don't even look at these trades you just place them and you go about your business you day"
"6427510","6432530"," trade all in here and you just hope that this prints and normally something like this is these kind"
"6432530","6439110"," of trades are the trades that keep your account alive these are the trades that are uh they usually"
"6439110","6444590"," they usually keep you funded so you can make bad bad day trades and risky gambling bets these are"
"6444590","6453290"," your fairly fairly um safe trades fairly now you know it's been fairly safe all year right um now"
"6453290","6457810"," you can be proved wrong you might let's say you win one two and three you win you lose your"
"6457810","6462850"," fourth that still makes you a 70 right 75% of the time so you should have started up here"
"6462850","6468450"," of course but you know it's if there is a turn here it should we should still at least at"
"6468450","6476250"," some point come back down here and you know what we could also look at would be um we could"
"6476250","6486010"," look at a um we could look at um just a simple moving average too"
"6486010","6495270"," and we could change it to a 200 uh"
"6495270","6507450"," let's see"
"6507450","6519010"," they can sauce that up a little bit for you so you can see it better and"
"6519010","6522630"," make that thicker somewhere I forget where to make it thicker but whatever for right now it's"
"6522630","6528790"," that's enough so you can see that this is what uh purr was saying was that we ricochet off he's"
"6528790","6535870"," claiming that before or ricochet off we should see as before we hit this channel so he's he's"
"6535870","6539970"," claiming that right now you should be buying your put spreads today now that's what one of his"
"6539970","6545550"," things he was saying was we should ricochet and that's right where let's see what let's see where"
"6545550","6555310"," that is today that would be right at 404 80 so I'm saying 406 uh so maybe you listen to"
"6555310","6561570"," him and not me if you just start putting that trade on right at 406 or 402 looks like it's"
"6561570","6569650"," 402 48 he's claiming and this is going to change of course 402 47 he's saying put the trade on"
"6571710","6576090"," then we're not even we're not even going to touch the top of this key he's saying we're going to"
"6576090","6580930"," bounce right off of that uh 200 moving average so yeah if you wanted to put it on here it's"
"6580930","6587530"," still a safe trade put it on here and you put it on at a higher rate it's whatever whatever"
"6587530","6594770"," your risk tolerance is for that trade but somewhere in here this is close enough in hand grenades"
"6594770","6602210"," and horseshoes that you're probably going to nail it between now and march and you know spreads"
"6602210","6607670"," once they come into the money you don't need to hold them to close they'll just start printing for"
"6607670","6619000"," you that's what I like about spreads and big trades see"
"6619000","6626080"," you guys are saying uh Twinkies point I'm buying different spreads you like that you're buying a"
"6626080","6632440"," 417 42 you like to keep the buy aside you like to keep the buy aside of a long term"
"6632440","6642320"," spread closely in the money uh I usually go through I usually go through I'll usually run through a"
"6642320","6650640"," bunch of different trades like this trade when I eventually put it on I'll try different strikes"
"6650640","6657080"," and I'll also look inside the options chain and see where all the money is I'll look to see where"
"6657080","6662040"," I'll start let's say I'm interested in certain strikes I'll start going through the options chains"
"6662040","6669320"," for that expiry and see if anyone else is in on that trade and I'll usually you can usually figure"
"6669320","6675900"," out the spreads other people have put out there you'll see you'll actually see like 20,000"
"6675900","6684220"," contracts let's say on 402 and you'll see 20,000 contracts on 350 and I'll try to follow along in"
"6684220","6693750"," that trade I don't trade futures because"
"6693750","6700930"," I used to stay awake all night long my my schedule I would trade futures if I lived in Europe"
"6700930","6708990"," um I the only time that I trade futures now is to hedge an overnight zero-day call I still"
"6708990","6720550"," have futures account I just don't bother trading it unless I'm hedging a cash market position time"
"6720550","6724850"," today if you're interested I'm interested in how you show them whether we're in a trend day or a"
"6724850","6731150"," chop day is there a way to identify that early in the day yeah you can you can usually identify"
"6731150","6739890"," trend days or sideways days right at the open not always um but right just right here at the I"
"6739890","6747210"," don't know you can't see that just the action off of um right here doesn't look"
"6747210","6756830"," like a gap up here I'm going to look for"
"6756830","6763990"," consolidation to move higher to show me the way higher if we just do a straight gap up here and"
"6763990","6769990"," then immediately start to sell it down I'll be looking for a move down for that day and then the"
"6769990","6775130"," setups of course before and learn how many days we're going up there's a bunch of stuff you have to"
"6775130","6782050"," look at like we're doing a three-bar pattern we're doing a five-bar pattern a nine-bar pattern um"
"6782050","6788330"," and that can usually explain as well we in consolidation because we've made a huge move is that an"
"6788330","6793950"," OPEC stay an important OPEC stay and there's a bunch different um reasons we would trade sideways"
"6793950","6803860"," or have a trend day are you going to pay margin for four months and futures no I just think"
"6803860","6811180"," you take a cash market put spread but that's all you do and you you want to do it you"
"6811180","6816260"," want to express that on SPX or spy because it settles the cash and the only other thing I would"
"6816260","6823780"," say on that would be I should have I should I should do an asterisk on this trade always consider"
"6823780","6830120"," um dividend payouts you want to look those up to when you make up when you place a spread you"
"6830120","6837160"," want to be checking see if the underlying you're putting it on settles the cash and the last one"
"6837160","6845180"," would be when one of their dividends announced and uh so that you don't try to close the position"
"6845180","6854060"," you don't want to you don't want to have an open position if you're expecting a dividend in that in"
"6854060","6859280"," the time period you don't want to be closing one because what they'll do is they'll um uh you'll"
"6859280","6865320"," get margin called on your position they'll close they'll close your position good time today so"
"6869450","6878250"," yeah you want to be careful that the least and you so the number one thing is the more liquid"
"6878250","6886150"," a stock or ticker or ETF is the least like the less likely you are to get um your position"
"6886150","6893170"," prematurely closed there's some other things you need to do wish there's a there you know there's a"
"6893170","6898010"," good guide as videos on this and i'll i'll try to find a link to where he discusses it in"
"6898010","6902410"," in depth and i'll post it on twitter because i'm not going to go through it i'm not going to"
"6902410","6907790"," go through it today because i want to be held to specifics without having my ducks in an order"
"6908850","6918850"," there's mostly why i portrayed spreads on the spy though is due to um it"
"6918850","6928430"," doesn't settle in cat it out matter of fact there was uh what what ticker was it there was a"
"6928430","6935690"," a ticker that typically doesn't or are during covid when they canceled dividends um it was great to"
"6935690","6941570"," trade spreads on some tickers i figure which tickers canceled dividends but i've just been a couple"
"6941570","6947430"," of years now but i remember there were companies canceling their dividends i think microsoft not"
"6947430","6951790"," i'm i only think they have dividends i forget which tickers they were but you can all of a sudden"
"6951790","6967460"," trade spreads on tickers without fear of uh having them closed out yeah"
"6967460","6972280"," there's time that there's a reason for diamond hands uh when to have diamond hands yeah disney"
"6972280","6979520"," canceled i remember disney canceled that was good with the lowest risk of you i'll i'll link the"
"6979520","6983880"," video it's the guy that i posted with the blonde hair in the glasses i figured his name he's from"

"7095470","7105470"," dividend dates on uh on sp wire spx and um i try not he doesn't always"
"7105470","7113630"," work but try to close those spreads before you get to those dates or not try and try not to"
"7113630","7124730"," have an expiry on those dates sometimes they don't announce"
"7124730","7130430"," that helps you guys uh and we are coming into that place so we're looking at that that big chart"
"7131730","7137870"," you know you could take a spread here it's not like we're at 402 right now so the 200 a"
"7137870","7142850"," we're right this is the 200 a right so if you were like hey cap i took a put spread"
"7142850","7149230"," into march today or at the end of today like right at the close like that's another thing about"
"7149230","7155770"," spreads when you execute them uh jess what if you guys follow up with jess he's a big tesla trader"
"7155770","7163130"," uh he has a great he DM'd me once his rules for trading spreads and he's got a kickass set"
"7163130","7168290"," of rules so if you can find him i think his name is tesla jess on twitter she came out"
"7168290","7173310"," on twitter just like hey tesla jess say cap jim james told me you've got some great rules for"
"7173310","7178250"," trading spreads and he's got them all typed out and everything and they're they're awesome they"
"7178250","7183710"," tell you uh time of data to start a spread when to close the spread data the weeks to open"
"7183710","7191490"," close the spread um when these are rules that he lives by tesla jess on twitter check him out and"
"7191490","7207450"," uh talk to him maybe he'll share some of his insights on some trading spreads and uh yeah yeah"
"7207450","7211410"," you'll see you'll see your spreads if that's me by a three-month spread you'll see them go you'll"
"7211410","7218470"," you'll it's weird like so i have a friend that um they used to trade spreads with shawn i don't"
"7218470","7224070"," know if he's listening right now he might be listening uh i remember we bought some uh we that's"
"7224070","7230730"," similar setup right there we're talking about we traded some amazon spreads i think we paid like"
"7230730","7237830"," five grand form or something and they will end up going to not zero but like they were worth like"
"7237830","7242130"," fucking like shit you not oh no so we bought them for like five grand they went up to like"
"7242130","7252450"," we have like eight thousand dollars in profit so put in five get back 13 uh"
"7252450","7259770"," and then they went down to like they were worth like two or three grand total at one point uh"
"7259770","7267870"," and then we were discussing the spreads and i was like just hold them until expiring and we'll see"
"7267870","7273810"," what happens and so um we're upside down that we ended up going into expiry like the third day"
"7273810","7279810"," before expiring they went full full on under the money they were worth like thirty thousand dollars"
"7279810","7286970"," or something insane uh but you know the the mental aspect of i should have taken the eight grand"
"7286970","7296150"," when i when i had the chance was which is what the discussion was about if"
"7296150","7303030"," we start uh that people have rules on that i used to have a rule that if my spreads hit"
"7303030","7309270"," 20 30 profit i always closed them i took the money and ran some people say 50% he closed"
"7309270","7317210"," them and there's another reason for that spreads sometimes will gain not always but average they'll"
"7317210","7324110"," gain their first 50% of profit then they won't hit their full potential 100% until the spread is"
"7324110","7332010"," almost in the expiry and people's idea behind this is well if i hit 50% let's say it's a"
"7332010","7339010"," three month spread and you hit 50% profit at a month in you can do new spreads and hit"
"7339010","7344730"," 50% three times for 150% if that makes any sense if you were to stay in that same"
"7344730","7351130"," trade right that three months trade you make your 50% the first month then you end up waiting two"
"7351130","7359730"," months to get the whole hundred percent so the time you had to sit there you could have made 150 "
"7359730","7366970","% instead of just the hundred so you ask spread traders they'll tell you that they take profit"
"7366970","7374030"," anywhere from 20 30 50 and then reenter a new spread even though they have more time on it and"
"7374030","7378450"," they'll do that two or three times instead of just that once and then having a diamond hand in hope"
"7378450","7386530"," that it comes full max once in a while you'll hit it lucky and you'll crank down and max out"
"7386530","7392930"," at that 100% before you ever get to that three month mark that's part of trading spreads i guess"
"7392930","7397010"," the rules you have to write for yourself when you take those trades what i like about those trades"
"7397010","7406390"," is that if you can go into them usually with a lot of money and they're they're statistically safe"
"7406390","7414890"," um personally statistically the bull spreads for me are statistically better even in a downtrend"
"7414890","7424830"," they tend to have like a 90 high 90% win rate on the bull side when"
"7424830","7431710"," they do on the bear side even in a downtrend so i'm not oh i'm not as much of a"
"7431710","7439230"," fan on the put spreads as i am on the uh call spread side on the bull and bull spreads"
"7446410","7454130"," i used to i used to i used to like cut sides loose i used to manage trades i used"
"7454130","7461350"," to trade a lot of condors and butterflies i i i don't feel like i can anymore with the way"
"7461350","7469110"," the market is so for me personally right now at large support and resistance zones i just place a"
"7469110","7476270"," bull or bear trade and then i day trade the rest of the move for the time in that trade"
"7476270","7485210"," that's a whole nother conversation about algorithms and them destroying the markets so i know guys"
"7485210","7492050"," that trade like that i tend not to anymore i felt like it was too complicated it was too too"
"7492050","7500430"," much of pain in the ass it's not complicated it's more um spending all of my time managing trades"
"7500430","7507410"," uh all the power to you if you're managing trades like that uh for me it's it's not for me"
"7507410","7513850"," uh in what i'm doing but i respect that uh that's all trading 100% i used to do it"
"7513850","7520070"," so i just don't anymore just run the wheel i just don't it's just it's just pain in the ass"
"7520070","7530050"," for me i can make more in zero dates typically than you can with with anything but it but"
"7530050","7537770"," you're talking about you know 10 12 15 years in the market you don't have that time in the market"
"7537770","7543550"," it's uh it's hard to make make that money they're safe for trades you'll go through this like if"
"7543550","7548190"," you guys have been trading for fucking i don't know 10 20 years or something you're gonna trade"

"8258870","8276469"," a nice little bull flag up there isn't it there's"
"8276469","8329590"," top up here here this"
"8329590","8352209"," is that four zero five zero right here so i guess the question becomes do"
"8352209","8363370"," we have a trade here i'm going to roll down that's"
"8363370","8375090"," one trade that's setting up the next trade would be a move here and then something like that those"
"8375090","8383150"," are the two trades uh what if you want the bearish trade you're going to want to see a failure"
"8383150","8390190"," in here and then you take that down uh so you're looking for if you if you want to get"
"8390190","8402340"," if you want to buy some puts you know"
"8402340","8408840"," bearish below bullish above watch out for this one right here this is the one that can sneak up and"
"8408840","8412900"," this is the bull just the bull trap is right there but you could probably trade this from here to"
"8412900","8425040"," here and then you want to you know trade each level uh"
"8425040","8431060"," but you don't want to see happen is this and then the fucking reverse right down the depths of hell"
"8431060","8439860"," into the into the fucking close that's that's the one i'd be looking at right now"
"8439860","8449080"," let's see how this works out uh there is some some mechanical problems there's uh 205,402"
"8449080","8459060"," peas uh expiring today 205,000 and it's growing now"
"8459060","8464620"," that shows it's trying to pin the market from going up uh question becomes do the dealers want to"
"8464620","8471580"," pay 205,000 contracts that are 18 cents into the close where do they want to burn them so my"
"8471580","8475980"," my thought process would be that they're going to try to burn them into the bell so my bias is"
"8475980","8481180"," going to be to up into the bell so between 1 and or 12 and 1 o'clock my bias"
"8481180","8487480"," is a move here into the close to burn all these puts that's"
"8487480","8497090"," what max um but if there is a break"
"8497090","8504150"," below for a failure on that if there's a failure in that trade uh i would be i would be"
"8504150","8514050"," buying some puts right about anything below this that we buy inputs it's only an hour"
"8514050","8525410"," left so we buy inputs right there so that bias is long into the bell at"
"8525410","8534590"," 12 p.m. eastern time ecb's the windows will be speaking how do you like that for a bias let"
"8534590","8544520"," me know in the chat if you agree with that we're going into no power our cap"
"8544520","8547940"," think they trade it down i think i just talked about all that right you guys heard my my take"
"8547940","8557700"," on this there's a 206,402 p's out there"
"8559520","8568360"," question becomes do they allow them to print into the bell or don't they the dealers probably want"
"8568360","8582830"," them to expire worthless they're at 18 cents right now is it"
"8582830","8588150"," mike it's the blonde guy with the glasses i'll find the video it came out a couple years ago it"
"8588150","8598290"," might be like a year or two old maybe longer might be like um a couple"
"8598290","8601990"," years old i think you did a couple of videos too i think there's like two or three videos you"

"10101890","10106290"," the market so let's just start with the baseline we've got way too many calls in the market that's"
"10106290","10113250"," why we have a um someone was asking what's going on so let's start the baseline there's a shit ton"
"10113250","10121310"," of calls in the money um they're in the market right so dealers have to get the multinational into"
"10121310","10127630"," the bell and uh you've got call holders that call spread holders that want their calls to print"
"10127630","10137070"," into the bell um so the max pain against those call holders that we trade down to 398 now that"
"10137070","10145730"," could happen after the bell this could happen between 1 and 4 pm not necessarily right now um and"
"10145730","10150410"," then you've got dealers that come in like little tinkerers right like little like little gremlins"
"10150410","10155650"," and you get banks that come in like little gremlins and what they'll do is try to manipulate the"
"10155650","10163370"," market uh to print to a certain number and they already have all this data so right now currently"
"10163370","10168730"," what you're seeing is you're seeing a little gremlin come into the stock market in the options"
"10168730","10176990"," chain and they're adding and adding and adding to their put positions uh trying to either pin the"
"10176990","10182810"," price or bring the bring the price down this could be the dealers doing the same thing uh now you"
"10182810","10187530"," don't know in the background how all this is being expressed you don't know how what the"
"10187530","10193010"," positioning is you can make assumptions as to what the positioning is but there's no guarantees as"
"10193010","10199530"," what the positioning is what they're actually trying to print or not print so this could just be"
