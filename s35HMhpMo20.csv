"s35HMhpMo20","0","7000"," Good morning traders, Kevin Jim James here with your daily brief for Friday, December"
"s35HMhpMo20","7000","8000"," 10th."
"s35HMhpMo20","8000","12760"," I was able to watch Biden speak earlier today that was not a good speech."
"s35HMhpMo20","12760","18680"," That was trying to put lipstick on a pig if there ever was that moment."
"s35HMhpMo20","18680","21960"," I do realize that the price of some goods have come down."
"s35HMhpMo20","21960","27200"," I know that gas has come down, but we know that inflation has already elevated."
"s35HMhpMo20","27200","30400"," We know that last year inflation was 6.2%."
"s35HMhpMo20","30400","34100"," We know that the expected is 6.8%."
"s35HMhpMo20","34100","39320"," Even a 0.6% difference is huge or huge or whatever."
"s35HMhpMo20","39320","41480"," It's just big."
"s35HMhpMo20","41480","47520"," Him coming out to speak today or yesterday or on Thursday infers that tomorrow's numbers"
"s35HMhpMo20","47520","50320"," are not going to be good."
"s35HMhpMo20","50320","52600"," What does that mean for us heading into tomorrow?"
"s35HMhpMo20","52600","59080"," It's trying to break the expectation level before we come into Friday's numbers that"
"s35HMhpMo20","59080","61080"," are not going to be good."
"s35HMhpMo20","61080","65840"," The market responded, but we kind of already knew the market was going to respond in that"
"s35HMhpMo20","65840","66840"," way."
"s35HMhpMo20","66840","71960"," We've already been talking about in previous videos that we weren't buyers until the market"
"s35HMhpMo20","71960","73160"," dipped lower."
"s35HMhpMo20","73160","78960"," We talked about that 4660, 4640 was my number that I wanted to start to buy in."
"s35HMhpMo20","78960","83800"," We also talked about the real juice being down at the 4600 level."
"s35HMhpMo20","83800","86680"," All it really took was a trigger for that to take place."
"s35HMhpMo20","86680","90240"," It came a day earlier than the CPI numbers."
"s35HMhpMo20","90240","95200"," Earlier today, I made some tweets to you asking you to, even if you're going to keep your"
"s35HMhpMo20","95200","101120"," longs on, to at least take on some protection on Thursday, and I hope that you did that today"
"s35HMhpMo20","101120","103480"," to protect your longs into that close."
"s35HMhpMo20","103480","104480"," That close was nasty."
"s35HMhpMo20","104480","109920"," I even tweeted as we started to fall off before it happened that I was looking to buy at"
"s35HMhpMo20","109920","111920"," very low levels at 4460."
"s35HMhpMo20","111920","116800"," We didn't quite get that low, but that was before we even started to drop."
"s35HMhpMo20","116800","121320"," I hope you guys were safe later this afternoon, that you bought some protection later this"
"s35HMhpMo20","121320","122320"," afternoon."
"s35HMhpMo20","122320","125400"," I hope that you exited your longs as we headed into close."
"s35HMhpMo20","125400","129600"," I wound up buying some far dated spreads down below there."
"s35HMhpMo20","129600","130920"," I think they're still safe."
"s35HMhpMo20","130920","132480"," They've got some good time on them."
"s35HMhpMo20","132480","137920"," I probably shouldn't have bought them because later in the day after the close, SG came"
"s35HMhpMo20","137920","139920"," out and put their hero numbers out."
"s35HMhpMo20","139920","143040"," I want to show these to you right now."
"s35HMhpMo20","143040","149000"," This is a chart that shows the normal puts and calls that are purchased in the course"
"s35HMhpMo20","149000","150840"," of a day."
"s35HMhpMo20","150840","157280"," When you see, let's say you see heavy puts coming into the market, that would be normal,"
"s35HMhpMo20","157280","163680"," but we actually saw not only puts, but heavy hedging coming into the market."
"s35HMhpMo20","163680","172760"," Per them, they came in on a high growth speculative stocks, including GME, AMC, and even Tesla."
"s35HMhpMo20","172760","179320"," That is cause for concern as we head forward as they make up a large part of the IWM, the"
"s35HMhpMo20","179320","181120"," spy and the NASDAQ."
"s35HMhpMo20","181120","184280"," This graph line heading lower is not healthy."
"s35HMhpMo20","184280","189760"," This means that the internals like an engine right of the market has some underlying flaws"
"s35HMhpMo20","189760","195560"," in it that the market is taking protection out on possibly rates actually happening."
"s35HMhpMo20","195560","196560"," It wasn't a good look."
"s35HMhpMo20","196560","201040"," I'm going to be honest with Biden saying that the numbers are not going to look good."
"s35HMhpMo20","201040","204800"," Do I think that we drop this market between now and Tuesday?"
"s35HMhpMo20","204800","205800"," Probably not."
"s35HMhpMo20","205800","209800"," Do I think there'll be weakness in this market from this point forward into Tuesday?"
"s35HMhpMo20","209800","210800"," Absolutely."
"s35HMhpMo20","210800","215840"," You're going to see people in these high growth speculative stocks start to close out their"
"s35HMhpMo20","215840","216840"," investments."
"s35HMhpMo20","216840","221440"," You're going to see some panic and speculative growth stocks, I think, as we head into Tuesday."
"s35HMhpMo20","221440","225520"," We're going to get into that right here and some things that you need to be looking out"
"s35HMhpMo20","225520","227520"," for as we head into Friday and Monday."
"s35HMhpMo20","227520","230240"," I want you to see something else here."
"s35HMhpMo20","230240","233520"," This is an article from the December 1st, I believe."
"s35HMhpMo20","233520","235000"," Yeah, December 1st."
"s35HMhpMo20","235000","240680"," This is an article with inflation risk rising, Fed's Powell prepares for a possible pivot."
"s35HMhpMo20","240680","243160"," You're going to see this negative news."
"s35HMhpMo20","243160","247120"," You're going to get hit with this constantly from this point forward due to the speech"
"s35HMhpMo20","247120","249720"," that was given on Thursday by the president."
"s35HMhpMo20","249720","254800"," You're going to see negative news coming up now until Tuesday and that will be the nod"
"s35HMhpMo20","254800","258920"," that you need to look for if you're a bull at this markets going to at least start to"
"s35HMhpMo20","258920","263800"," head lower from now until Monday, maybe it'll flatten out as we get closer, but if you're"
"s35HMhpMo20","263800","268840"," a bull from this point forward, I would be very, very cautious after seeing that hedging"
"s35HMhpMo20","268840","270520"," coming into the market."
"s35HMhpMo20","270520","274200"," Now, let's look real quick at charts."
"s35HMhpMo20","274200","278320"," When I first started making videos, when I first really started making videos for you"
"s35HMhpMo20","278320","284840"," guys, or how I started out was I just did a text daily brief on my Twitter feed."
"s35HMhpMo20","284840","286920"," Then I started making videos."
"s35HMhpMo20","286920","290280"," I started out with just candlestick charts."
"s35HMhpMo20","290280","295320"," I just wanted you to understand that, and then I started to talk to you about positive"
"s35HMhpMo20","295320","297520"," and negative gamma in the market."
"s35HMhpMo20","297520","301320"," I started to explain to you that there are sellers hiding above."
"s35HMhpMo20","301320","303760"," That's where that volatility is at."
"s35HMhpMo20","303760","308840"," Then down below, there are buyers that come up and want to buy the market at a better"
"s35HMhpMo20","308840","309840"," price."
"s35HMhpMo20","309840","314000"," In the previous videos this week, I've told you that I wanted to buy at a lower price"
"s35HMhpMo20","314000","319120"," over here, and I'm constantly being told, no, no, we're going higher, we're going higher."
"s35HMhpMo20","319120","323000"," There was some runway to go higher back here earlier in the week, but there really isn't"
"s35HMhpMo20","323000","324960"," that runway at this point."
"s35HMhpMo20","324960","328080"," Time is not on our side for the FOMC."
"s35HMhpMo20","328080","333120"," Then the speech that Biden gave on Thursday was no help as well."
"s35HMhpMo20","333120","338320"," Then the last part of that process is that we saw more hedging coming into the market"
"s35HMhpMo20","338320","342280"," than we should have for rates to not be on the table."
"s35HMhpMo20","342280","348120"," Up until today, I don't think rates were on the table, but we had fear from major institutions"
"s35HMhpMo20","348120","351800"," and banks, and they began to hedge into close today."
"s35HMhpMo20","351800","352800"," Keep that in mind."
"s35HMhpMo20","353800","359080"," I worked on my editing software to try to hide my credentials, and I'm getting better"
"s35HMhpMo20","359080","360360"," at it."
"s35HMhpMo20","360360","366200"," I wanted to bring up another screener for you tonight."
"s35HMhpMo20","366200","370320"," I wanted to bring up, first I'm going to bring up the IWM for you."
"s35HMhpMo20","370320","373400"," What's important in the item, well, first of all, this is the volume profile, we'll"
"s35HMhpMo20","373400","382360"," start with ES, let's start with ES because of what happened today."
"s35HMhpMo20","382360","386480"," When you guys are all asking me if we were going to go higher, and we were back here,"
"s35HMhpMo20","386480","390600"," so this is Thursday right here, but if you're looking at Wednesday right here, there was"
"s35HMhpMo20","390600","397960"," a possibility if we had rocket ships up, we could have gotten higher on Thursday, but"
"s35HMhpMo20","397960","401800"," we kind of petered out towards the end of the day, and then I was asked, hey, you're"
"s35HMhpMo20","401800","405720"," going to take some call FDs into the close, and I was like, I don't think so."
"s35HMhpMo20","405720","412280"," I really need to see us kind of crater down below here to get this liquidity down below,"
"s35HMhpMo20","412280","417960"," and we didn't crater down below here, so I didn't take FDs into this close on Wednesday"
"s35HMhpMo20","417960","419800"," heading into Thursday."
"s35HMhpMo20","419800","425280"," Now, when we were at this moment in the market yesterday, I tweeted to you to put some protection"
"s35HMhpMo20","425280","426280"," on."
"s35HMhpMo20","426280","431720"," I hope that you guys did, because what we started to do was to sell off as the president began"
"s35HMhpMo20","431720","438520"," to put lipstick on the CPI pig, and we did that right into close down here."
"s35HMhpMo20","439520","443280"," This volume profile is showing you where the buyers are."
"s35HMhpMo20","443280","444280"," Now, this is me."
"s35HMhpMo20","444280","452040"," I wanted to be buying down here at 46.40, and the smart money is down here at 4600."
"s35HMhpMo20","452040","457320"," If the CPI numbers weren't going to be that bad, I don't think the banks would have set"
"s35HMhpMo20","457320","463800"," this market, and you saw liquidity step in before on Monday into Tuesday, so the market"
"s35HMhpMo20","463800","469920"," was looking pretty positive, but from what Biden had said on Thursday, the positivity"
"s35HMhpMo20","469920","470920"," is gone."
"s35HMhpMo20","470920","475600"," The banks, the hedge funds, the institutions, they're going to slap the hedges on."
"s35HMhpMo20","475600","479960"," That's what they did at the end into the close, and they want to make sure that they protect"
"s35HMhpMo20","479960","484360"," themselves, that they make money, and so that's what they wound up doing on Thursday."
"s35HMhpMo20","484360","489320"," You have to be aware of that as we head forward, so even though we're in a positive gamma situation"
"s35HMhpMo20","489320","493240"," right now, that the tides have somewhat turned."
"s35HMhpMo20","493240","498480"," So I want you to think about that as we head into Friday and Monday, and where we are."
"s35HMhpMo20","498480","502600"," You really do need to be putting on some protection."
"s35HMhpMo20","502600","507600"," You really need to probably stop trading if you're a bull into Monday, even if we go"
"s35HMhpMo20","507600","513400"," higher, because there is some implications that are the chances of us beginning the taper"
"s35HMhpMo20","513400","521120"," into on Tuesday have grown at this point by the nod of the hat from banks and institutions."
"s35HMhpMo20","521120","526600"," I want you to show you one other volume profile, and that is IWM, and this is another concern"
"s35HMhpMo20","526600","527600"," as well."
"s35HMhpMo20","527600","532240"," Show you this right here, and you can see that we sold below today rather than higher."
"s35HMhpMo20","532240","536960"," We started to sell off, and we sold below where the buyers were."
"s35HMhpMo20","536960","541880"," Now this right here is a point of control down at 217.74."
"s35HMhpMo20","541880","544200"," You can call it at 218 if you want."
"s35HMhpMo20","544200","550960"," I'm hoping for IWM to stabilize into Friday and hopefully Monday, but if we start to"
"s35HMhpMo20","550960","557200"," get any panic in those speculative stocks, you can start to see real selling in the market."
"s35HMhpMo20","557200","559200"," This is the internals of the market."
"s35HMhpMo20","559200","564040"," The real internals of the market are small caps, and so there's some concern here if"
"s35HMhpMo20","564040","569200"," we begin to sell much lower down here, that it'll start to drop the other indexes."
"s35HMhpMo20","569200","575400"," I'm going to leave you with this heading into tomorrow, that if we do trade sideways at"
"s35HMhpMo20","575400","579400"," some point tomorrow, let's say we have some volatility in the morning and we recover in"
"s35HMhpMo20","579440","583920"," the afternoon, and most of the trading in Friday's is done in the morning, but not"
"s35HMhpMo20","583920","584920"," of recent."
"s35HMhpMo20","584920","591160"," If we get a slow part tomorrow, we can discuss what your plans are heading into next week."
"s35HMhpMo20","591160","593080"," If it was me, I'm a bull."
"s35HMhpMo20","593080","599600"," If it was me, I would be wrapping up any outstanding longs that I have, and then I would be probably"
"s35HMhpMo20","599600","604960"," trying to put some protection on, and possibly even playing this market heading lower into"
"s35HMhpMo20","604960","606200"," Tuesday."
"s35HMhpMo20","606200","611520"," I don't think though that I'll be short into into Tuesday itself, or be holding or be"
"s35HMhpMo20","611520","614720"," long in puts on Tuesday myself as well."
"s35HMhpMo20","614720","617480"," I think that it could go anyway."
"s35HMhpMo20","617480","621160"," I don't think anyone really knows, even though you're going to see this negative news, nobody"
"s35HMhpMo20","621160","625360"," really does know if a raising rates or not, but we're not supposed to know it's a national"
"s35HMhpMo20","625360","630080"," security secret, and if you do get caught releasing that stuff, there's a problem."
"s35HMhpMo20","630080","634360"," But with that being said, let's do a live stream tomorrow, I want to answer any questions or"
"s35HMhpMo20","634360","638800"," any fears that you might have heading into the FOMC this following week."
"s35HMhpMo20","638800","643720"," Hope you have a great training day this morning, and I'll be with you all day long again."
"s35HMhpMo20","643720","645080"," See you tomorrow or see you this morning."
