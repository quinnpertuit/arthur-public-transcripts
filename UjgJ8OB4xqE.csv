"55750","61700"," All right, good morning."
"65140","66560"," Let's see what's going on here."
"72090","76970"," Good morning out of suit, good morning to Taz, James, Chaz, B.D., Dylan, B.K., Tack. "
"77790","78710"," Morning, B.K., how are you?"
"78890","79490"," I haven't seen you in a while."
"80070","81010"," Carly, cowboy starfish."
"81190","81610"," Good to see you. "
"82290","83490"," Flying their style all the way."
"84570","85530"," Maz, Maz, your wife's boyfriend."
"85870","86270"," What's going on?"
"87750","87890"," Nice. "
"89090","93250"," That's getting better in there, your wife's boyfriend, right on NBC, one day at a time."
"96630","98830"," Mac Foster, which turned this down over here."
"100090","103530"," Feeling a little in the weather this morning, I don't know why. "
"103630","106010"," I think I might have ate something that didn't agree with me."
"107930","109570"," My camera's not on either, huh?"
"111550","115150"," Oh, there we go, another down camera day, hold on a second here."
"126220","127100"," Looks like it's working. "
"127960","128580"," All right."
"129880","131860"," Good to see everybody this morning, how are you all doing?"
"134420","135060"," Let's see here."
"140260","141660"," Yeah, I don't have everything up and running. "
"141840","142720"," I think I have everything up and running."
"142720","143300"," I think I have everything up and running right now."
"143340","147200"," I have some issues this morning with hardware. "
"152180","153560"," All right, so we're going to turn this off here."
"156900","158400"," We're going to switch right over to the live stream."
"161220","165820"," And there's not too much going on right now in the market, so we'll take a look real quick. "
"165960","167420"," I posted this on Twitter earlier."
"168460","169560"," And here's your R1."
"169560","172160"," Over here for this morning, we'll go over there. "
"172260","182260"," If you haven't, if you hadn't seen it, your support, or excuse me, support one is down here"
"182260","184980"," at 45, 750."
"186560","190500"," And then support two is down here."
"190520","196580"," We're going to talk about this, what's going on right now in the market because I was on Twitter"
"196580","198680"," briefly checking to see what people had to say. "
"200360","206980"," And this morning, so basically we're going to talk about this because of, so you have a feel for"
"206980","212220"," what's going on in the market this morning, so like below, below, below, over here."
"217280","218740"," Let's wear it again, some feedback."
"220000","221740"," I don't know where that feedback's coming from. "
"224440","226740"," All right, this is our two up here, right?"
"229920","234880"," And we're going to talk, you know what I'll do is I'll bring up the spot camera report."
"236840","241000"," But I just want to give you a visualization of what's happening right now, okay?"
"242060","246420"," Now the bears are expecting some kind of a rollover where we trade down to the depths of hell down"
"246420","246640"," here."
"251720","256680"," You know, that's a expectation, right?"
"257279","258640"," As soon as the rally's done. "
"258899","264740"," And you can remember as if you're a bull out there, a fair in the market, the moment that a"
"264740","269660"," 15 minutes or so into the trading session, the Dow down 50 points or so, the S&P down 15"
"269660","274560"," handles at 46, 15 in the NASDAQ composite of 14,000, 550 down 70."
"276000","278480"," Crew futures remain higher by 4%."
"278480","286360"," The US 10-year yield at 2.405%. It's up about a basis point on the day. "
"287800","293660"," The equity markets outside the foot to 100 remain largely in negative territory led by the Dow."
"294060","294840"," Turn that off."
"295620","296800"," That's not important at this point. "
"297060","301720"," What is important, though, is that we had a regime of fear, right?"
"303340","311880"," When this regime of fear, you know, that started back here in January, it started."
"312400","321480"," A regime of fear, it actually started in January of 2021 for a lot of individual tickers,"
"321880","323540"," especially a speculative growth stocks, right?"
"323920","324440"," Stonks."
"325860","330200"," Started creeping the market back in September, November, but it really kicked in in January. "
"331580","333940"," And any rally was unsustained."
"334400","340100"," Also, any rally that took place, those calls were basically short-lived, right?"
"340260","340780"," They were in the money."
"341140","343260"," They were a day, maybe three days out at max. "
"344560","348120"," And the moment that fear would creep into the market, we would immediately sell off."
"349980","351900"," And there was mass fear in the market."
"352200","354540"," So I wanted to post this on Twitter somewhere, but I didn't. "
"354800","359740"," But anyway, this run here, there's a few things you need to understand and know."
"360940","367540"," And first is that the calls and the buying in the market, they were outside the money calls,"
"367540","368720"," farther dated out."
"369480","371120"," There was a bid put into the market. "
"371400","374420"," Retail traders, believe it or not, didn't partake most of this."
"374840","377420"," We saw some retail traders buying calls past few days."
"378740","380760"," But generally speaking, there's been no FOMO in here. "
"381680","385900"," And you might have bought calls in here, but the majority of retail did not."
"386780","390080"," This was led by institutional longs in the market."
"391280","394720"," You can see why we haven't had any fear sell-offs this whole entire run. "
"394720","397200"," It's because institutions were long in this market."
"398060","400640"," So you have to be aware of that for where we are right now, okay?"
"401540","406720"," So we have calls that are coming into, like a flower, right, into bloom, right?"
"407440","409160"," You've got calls that are bought down below."
"409340","411180"," They're coming into the 460 range. "
"412020","416760"," And what you're seeing right now is you're seeing some profit taking up in here, okay?"
"417760","421360"," And you saw it this morning, I think in Amazon, we talked about it yesterday about Amazon briefly."
"422060","425960"," Many of these stocks that have been coming up, you see some profit taking going on."
"426960","431400"," Now, unlike the previous regime over here, where we had fair in the market, huge fair in the"
"431400","437740"," market, typically what you would see in the past, you would see immediate sell-offs, right?"
"437900","438940"," We'd start borrowing the market down. "
"439080","442220"," People would close out their zero-day, one-day, three-day calls."
"443040","443880"," They were in the money."
"444120","446680"," They were just buying calls and the money, and that was it. "
"448360","451580"," Now, with that said, right now, we don't have that going on."
"452280","453760"," So there is a bid in the market."
"455000","458760"," These institutional investors will be rolling the market. "
"458960","464320"," What they do is they take their profits, they'll bump it back up to 460, take some profit, it'll"
"464320","467880"," slide back down, it'll bump back up, they'll take their profit, it'll slide back down."
"468140","472500"," Meanwhile, they're rotating into other stocks in the market."
"472740","475920"," You saw that yesterday, we spoke about a few of them, like Wingstop, right?"
"476500","481180"," I think this morning I saw a stock, I think Twilio was up this morning. "
"481660","485840"," I don't know if it's still up right now, but you can still see rotation into other baskets of"
"485840","486040"," stock."
"486260","490240"," So try to identify those today and the remaining days ahead."
"491060","496800"," Now, with that being said, we looked at, we looked at, I'm going to show you this, right?"
"496960","497960"," I'll show you this one more time. "
"500400","504860"," With that said, there's a couple of other things you need to understand for why, for why, when"
"504860","506380"," we're here, what can take place?"
"506980","512799"," We looked earlier in the week at the breadth of the market and the breadth was about what it should"
"512799","515200"," be for where we are right now."
"515679","520360"," If more money decides to enter the market, we will actually continue to go up."
"520580","524780"," And furthermore, you don't have the retail FOMO, believe it or not, that has taken place here. "
"524900","530160"," So if there is a dip of any kind currently in the next few days, two, three days, you can"
"530160","533080"," still see dips being bought and the market continue to move up."
"534320","538980"," We're going to talk about that right now because I'm going to show you, I want to show you, let"
"538980","543160"," this load up right here and I want to show you briefly, moments in the market that continue to melt"
"543160","546140"," up and moments where they did not."
"546460","554820"," So where breadth of the market started to roll and yet the market continued to melt up. "
"555500","557500"," And then a moment where the breadth started to roll."
"557500","558500"," I'm going to show it to you right here."
"558980","562380"," You can look back here, this is October 20th, 2021. "
"562960","567280"," The breadth began to roll over, but we continued to melt up here, right?"
"567560","568760"," Hard to time a top in here."
"569040","572040"," It eventually rolled over once the market breadth rolled over here."
"572600","576820"," But you could see technically the S&P 500 continue higher over time. "
"577120","578980"," It's not necessarily going to roll over."
"579980","583580"," And the market breadth go down slightly and other stocks do well."
"583940","586220"," Other components of the S&P 500 do well. "
"586220","588720"," And here's another example over here I'm going to show you."
"588960","593200"," This is one where the market breadth started to roll over, right here."
"594460","597140"," And we actually started to liquidate the entire market, right?"
"597280","599180"," The entire market quickly liquidated. "
"599540","605460"," So here are two different examples of market breadth and different impacts on the market."
"605660","607600"," And you can also see that the breadth stayed up."
"607740","608920"," There's some rotation in here. "
"609220","612060"," So we'll be looking for that in the coming days."
"612600","615540"," So if you're a bear out there and you're like, oh, I can fucking time the top."
"615560","618300"," And I know exactly when the market's going to roll over, it's going to fucking dump. "
"619100","619520"," I'm sorry."
"619680","622080"," I can show you two easy examples here where you can't."
"623840","625600"," So we have to pay attention to the market breadth. "
"625660","628920"," We have to pay attention to, is there a re-bid in the market?"
"629420","633120"," And when the bid in the market leaves, right?"
"633540","635820"," If we're not seeing any more rotation in the market."
"635980","637980"," Right now, there's still rotation in the market."
"638680","641500"," The other thing is that we still have all these calls. "
"641500","644560"," All is call gamma in the market right now."
"645740","650700"," And so when you're looking at that call gamma in the market, none of these calls leave the market"
"650700","651900"," until Friday, right?"
"652080","657020"," So we've got the 30th, we've got the 31st, and we've got the 1st over here."
"657120","657820"," It's the next three days. "
"658940","662920"," And as long as this call gamma stays, it'll wean off over time."
"663140","665020"," So we could do a slow roll over here."
"666200","667960"," If no more call buying steps in. "
"669500","675460"," But at any point, at any point, let's say we're to trade down here."
"676040","677060"," And a dip was bought."
"677280","678300"," It would go up, okay?"
"679620","680740"," Same thing over here. "
"680860","682040"," You can see a dip buy over here."
"682560","687940"," And the reason I was bringing up retail FOMO was my thought process, I'm not sure this is going to"
"687940","688040"," happen."
"688140","690000"," I can't, you know, I don't have a crystal ball or anything like that. "
"690200","696700"," But without that FOMO in the market, I believe that there are a lot of bulls that haven't bought"
"696700","697380"," dips in here."
"697680","699840"," And they're just waiting for that chance to buy a dip."
"700040","704860"," So it's possible retail could step in at some point and continue to pump this market up for the"
"704860","706540"," next few days until the weekend comes. "
"706920","709220"," Now we'll have to take a look and see what kind of calls they're buying."
"709540","715640"," Are they buying calls that are slightly outside the money and into April for these calls that are"
"715640","718060"," in the money, zero, one, three dates."
"719280","721100"," And they're just playing the action for the next few days. "
"721740","723320"," So what does this mean for you as a trader?"
"723320","728080"," It means that you have to be careful the next couple of days of the retail traders stepping in,"
"728180","728260"," right?"
"728640","734060"," Watching out for the sharks swimming around here, looking to be buying dips to send this higher."
"734460","738160"," If you're a bear, you have to be careful of this as well happening."
"738380","742040"," These dips being bought while all this call gamma sits out here. "
"742240","743340"," And what's the effect of that?"
"744760","747240"," When there's call gamma on the market still, right?"
"747820","751480"," It crushes volatility, it crushes IV."
"751480","757240"," So you're not going to put expansion or even market expansion."
"757760","758960"," I should probably reword that. "
"759200","765800"," Meaning that our trading range, right, is not going to expand until time passes, right?"
"766600","769220"," So if we don't see calls coming to market right now, right?"
"769740","774220"," And you're bear expecting this huge move, you're more than likely not going to see any violent"
"774220","779440"," moves down until after Friday, unless some event takes place."
"779440","780960"," Maybe, I don't know."
"781220","782880"," I don't know what could happen right now, right?"
"783000","784600"," The way the news is being used for bullshit. "
"785140","786700"," It could be some negative news on Ukraine."
"787280","788840"," It could be economic news."
"789060","793380"," It looks like we're not paying attention to any of the news cycle unless it fits the narrative. "
"794060","798460"," I'm assured that if we don't get any calls in the market, when you start to see the market roll"
"798460","803460"," over coming into Monday or Tuesday, they'll make up an excuse as to why the fucking markets are"
"803460","803860"," rolling over."
"804340","811840"," And if the same token, if we see call expansion in the market, you'll see some other news used for"
"811840","814060"," why we're continuing up as we head into Monday as well."
"814500","815560"," So just pay attention to that. "
"815820","817260"," The options flow is inside Discord."
"818540","819080"," You can look."
"819900","821940"," I think you can get into Discord right now. "
"821960","823760"," I think I bought a Nitro thing."
"824700","828660"," That's every month that supposedly allows more viewers inside of the options."
"828940","830200"," Well, I didn't know there was a limit on it. "
"830580","832480"," So try to get in there."
"832480","835660"," I think you get 100 or 200 people in there to watch all day long."
"835660","838560"," I'm not sure if it does or it doesn't. "
"838620","841780"," There's some buying this morning on Tesla and Apple as well."
"841900","843720"," Some dip buyers stepping in this morning."
"844920","846580"," So with that being said, right?"
"847100","848540"," With all this being said. "
"849060","851360"," Well, you're in all this stuff over here."
"853760","855880"," With all that being said right now, right?"
"856500","860900"," If you were a day trader, if you were a day trader, you're just looking for dips to buy in"
"860900","861100"," here."
"861100","864620"," If you see any kind of a bump down here, right?"
"864760","866080"," This little channel that we've got here. "
"866340","870240"," If you see a little dip buy down here at S1 or S2, you know these have been bought up"
"870240","870780"," for the past."
"871200","872620"," I mean, how many days have these been bought up?"
"872740","875680"," We got one dip buy down here, another one, another one."
"875980","877500"," And another one yesterday, right?"
"877620","879060"," We even get down low enough yesterday. "
"879740","881800"," This is where I think that FOMO is."
"882620","886040"," I was thinking about this yesterday and I'm like, man, these fucking bulls have been missing every"
"886040","886780"," single one of these dips."
"887360","888800"," And they've just been gunning to buy them. "
"888800","894980"," And seeing this yesterday watching the probe of bears yesterday, not being able to break through."
"895300","898140"," And you saw that third tap went straight up to the fucking moon yesterday."
"898820","901860"," I think the same thing is going to happen for the next few days. "
"902280","905920"," The last point in this is, believe it or not, end of quarter does matter."
"906560","909660"," You may think it matters, may not think it matters, but it does."
"910300","914480"," And you are going to have people out there that want to plug in this microphone. "
"915620","918280"," You're going to have people in there that don't want to see 475."
"919140","920920"," And we're actually not that far away from it."
"921000","923580"," If you're looking at this, right, feeling this from yesterday, right?"
"923680","926080"," We traded high, we traded back down bouncing right now. "
"926360","928760"," We're still in this upward moving channel here."
"929400","932280"," Nothing about right now is saying anything otherwise."
"932800","934580"," And you know, as a matter of fact, right?"
"936080","937720"," If you start looking up here, right?"
"938820","943940"," It's not it's still nothing for us to get up to that 475 heading into. "
"945720","946520"," The 31st."
"946860","947640"," It really isn't."
"947700","951800"," If any of this maintains or any dips get bought up in here, it's still viable. "
"952060","952880"," It's still on the table."
"953060","956100"," Now, I know a bunch of people out there are talking about 466."
"956560","957780"," This is the top over here. "
"958060","959780"," I'll tell you what, if you get this close, right?"
"960580","963120"," And we pull this into the 31st."
"963220","965020"," They wouldn't shock me to see his blast up here."
"965340","966380"," Close that green quarter. "
"967460","969600"," And everybody's given the quarterback slop ass shit."
"971520","972960"," Into the 31st."
"973740","979840"," Furthermore, if you really, really wanted to put the most pain on the bears, that's the price"
"979840","980480"," target up there. "
"980980","983140"," Now, I know people are saying 466 over here."
"983500","984200"," This is the top."
"985240","986740"," And because of what's going on over here. "
"986980","987740"," But we don't know."
"987940","989580"," We haven't seen the calls from the market."
"989600","991100"," We haven't seen calls knocking the market. "
"991820","996480"," You just fucking literally pull shit out your ass and trying to try to tell people what it is."
"996680","998740"," And I don't think you know what it is yet."
"998740","1003760"," I think you have to see what outside forces are working on in this market right now. "
"1004000","1005760"," Heading into the 31st, okay?"
"1006020","1007740"," So we'll play this and be aware of it."
"1008380","1011800"," We'll be looking to buy dips today and watch the flow that comes in."
"1012100","1017640"," I saw a post yesterday by TradyTix about you should take profit now. "
"1018320","1019580"," But they didn't give any reason."
"1019580","1022880"," They showed some of the big bearish positions that came in yesterday."
"1023780","1024819"," You guys have to understand. "
"1025240","1026339"," It's kind of fucking crazy."
"1026339","1029040"," I'm watching that post yesterday with zero contacts."
"1029319","1034099"," And I'm like, these fucking people are posting on fucking Twitter with zero contacts about hedging"
"1034099","1034920"," coming into the market. "
"1035220","1035760"," It's impact."
"1036240","1039300"," Can you actually get that low without continued flow?"
"1040420","1041880"," All kinds of fucking nonsense."
"1042740","1048920"," So I was like, in reality, there's a requirement to take profit here. "
"1049020","1052880"," You can if we bounce back up 462, you can take some profit."
"1052880","1059140"," But in reality, none of that flow that came in yesterday was bearish in any way, shape or form."
"1059480","1062900"," They could set up bearish if no more call flow comes in after Friday. "
"1063040","1064780"," But for today, it means nothing."
"1065000","1067800"," As a matter of fact, the statement from them yesterday meant nothing."
"1068120","1069140"," It meant nothing. "
"1069260","1070120"," It had no context."
"1071420","1075700"," It wasn't none of that hedging flow was followed by put flow on top of that hedging flow."
"1076620","1081400"," The fucking gamma that's on the market right now pins the market no matter what. "
"1081400","1084920"," So I was kind of scratching my head like, oh, I should be taking profit and buying puts today."
"1085260","1086880"," Like the paper posted that last night."
"1087000","1091080"," I'm like, you're fucking puts to be fucking dead today, tomorrow, next day and Friday. "
"1091640","1094580"," And what five fucking days later your puts are going to print get fucked with that shit."
"1094920","1098540"," So anyways, I saw that shit last night and I'm like, how do these fucking people make all this"
"1098540","1098920"," money?"
"1099360","1103200"," Yet they give zero fucking context for the shit they're fucking stoking on Twitter."
"1103580","1109360"," It's almost like they're trying to create a narrative that technically has no fucking bearing on"
"1109360","1110240"," where this market's going. "
"1110940","1111280"," None."
"1112240","1112580"," Whatever."
"1113020","1113200"," Okay. "
"1113280","1116700"," It's my rant on on trading ticks and they're fucking bullshit."
"1117860","1121460"," Anyways, it just stokes crates fear in the market and for in social media and it kind of rubbed me"
"1121460","1122300"," the wrong way last night."
"1122340","1125080"," I didn't want to post about it on Twitter last night, but I was kind of pissy about it. "
"1127880","1128560"," Anyways, okay."
"1128720","1129900"," So we're going to talk about some other stuff here."
"1130000","1130100"," Okay. "
"1132860","1134680"," So we're talking about a few other things this morning."
"1134680","1136200"," So you guys got this information here."
"1136200","1136780"," Go to the spot. "
"1136980","1137380"," Gamma news."
"1137560","1138180"," They were real quick."
"1138260","1144360"," And then I'll turn trade news back on futures acquired old overnight holding just above 4600"
"1144360","1144780"," volatility. "
"1144780","1150540"," This figure remain muted again for today with 46 for 60 call walls."
"1150820","1152440"," Actually, four six to not four 60."
"1152780","1154460"," This is inaccurate right here. "
"1154500","1154920"," That's wrong."
"1155520","1163120"," Four six to please see us a support line at four five seven five four five five zero."
"1163840","1168260"," As of yesterday, should the four sixty spy call while we breach to the upside, we consider the"
"1168260","1171220"," market over bought and look for mean revision back below that area. "
"1171840","1172540"," So here we go."
"1172660","1176520"," So anytime we bounce above four sixty up to four sixty two, right?"
"1176660","1180180"," You'll see profits being taken and then the market push backwards, right?"
"1180900","1187280"," The options market continues to be priced in low volatility in sync with our models stays SPX at"
"1187280","1190300"," money straddles trading near twenty seven dollars point five percent."
"1191380","1195420"," Obviously, the VIX was battered yesterday hitting an intraday low of eighteen sixty seven. "
"1196000","1197360"," Now, a couple of notes on this, right?"
"1197480","1200440"," I heard everybody talking about the fucking VIX is another fucking rant."
"1200980","1201900"," The VIX fiasco."
"1202760","1204920"," We talked about the VIX fiasco before it happened. "
"1204920","1206700"," We knew it was going to happen."
"1207140","1208520"," So it's not like it was a fucking fiasco."
"1209740","1213200"," It would the funniest part too is they're trying to blame the VIX fiasco and where we are right now"
"1213200","1214660"," has nothing to fucking do with it. "
"1215780","1218680"," But the VIX was battered yesterday hitting an intraday low of eighteen sixty seven."
"1218880","1222400"," This suggests that the volatility premium is short dated options, right?"
"1223740","1225640"," There is a diminuis, right?"
"1226240","1228540"," Which reduces VANO level, which means it's inconsequential."
"1228660","1232220"," This is just a multiple fucking Catholic Latin if you're any guys are Catholic out there. "
"1232580","1233660"," That just means it means nothing."
"1234360","1239440"," To this point, our VANO models now show implied volatility as a drag on SPX movement."
"1239960","1242660"," This is implied by the left tilt of this model as shown below. "
"1243120","1248160"," As we recently discussed since February, we've had the mayor opposite plot, which was the result of"
"1248160","1248900"," put heavy markets."
"1249540","1252720"," Markets with thick put positions are quite sensitive to implied volatility."
"1253420","1257320"," Remember here we talked about without continued put flow. "
"1258380","1260160"," We're not going to see those lower numbers."
"1260380","1262380"," So we know that there's a shit ton of puts."
"1262580","1263440"," This is a couple weeks ago. "
"1263980","1264520"," Excuse me."
"1264620","1265240"," There was a couple."
"1265400","1267500"," There was a bunch of fucking puts down at four zero five zero. "
"1268640","1272640"," And the point was we won't get there unless more puts come into the market."
"1273320","1277240"," And we didn't get there because we didn't see that waterfall effect to get us down below."
"1277700","1278920"," After that quick move down below. "
"1279120","1281800"," Same thing on the inverse as a bull, right?"
"1281940","1284220"," You're looking, we have puts above at four sixty four seventy."
"1284940","1285380"," We need more."
"1285760","1288820"," We need more like four seventy and then even for eighty to get us higher. "
"1290700","1293540"," Markets with thick put positions are quite sensitive to implied volatility."
"1293860","1296720"," The change of which is inversely correlated to the market price, two market prices."
"1297240","1299400"," While we look for a little happening today. "
"1300160","1303100"," We do have back to back explorations Thursday and Friday."
"1303540","1305040"," Remember when we talked about this last week?"
"1305120","1308680"," I said, Hey, we got, you know, we got a fucking expiration on Monday."
"1309240","1312660"," We got another one on I think Wednesday and then we have one on Thursday. "
"1312780","1313620"," We got one on Friday."
"1313920","1315180"," We got another one on Monday."
"1315860","1318770"," I'm surprised I didn't bring up the one for Monday as well, but whatever. "
"1319520","1323280"," This is not much of an event for SPX, but we see over 50% of spy gamma being removed."
"1323720","1325040"," This is important here, okay?"
"1326420","1330780"," This could reduce the grip of gamma on volatility right here."
"1331960","1335140"," The grip of gamma on volatility a bit, right?"
"1335820","1339160"," A bit, not huge, but we don't currently see it as material. "
"1340320","1344980"," For now, any selling we think would appear as more as consolidation rather than heavy declines."
"1345640","1351140"," We do not see more market upside until unless those four sixty call walls shift higher, right?"
"1351140","1354160"," That I either saying more calls need to come into the market."
"1354360","1357640"," They're also saying that any dips right now should be bought. "
"1357800","1361060"," The regime right now is not a put heavy regime."
"1361680","1368300"," So you're looking for dips down hit a rebot and it's interesting because they didn't mention this,"
"1368460","1370160"," but the call you're looking for two types of calls."
"1370480","1375440"," If you're looking for zero through one dates, you could see rips in this rally here, right?"
"1375700","1376640"," That are short live. "
"1377120","1383160"," If you see calls that come into the market that are farther dated out, i.e. April and slightly more"
"1383160","1387200"," outside the money, i.e. 480, 475, anything like that."
"1387320","1390300"," We saw some SPX calls coming in at 475 yesterday."
"1390600","1393840"," We want to see more expansion of that for us to trade higher. "
"1394240","1398340"," Now, because we're not in that put heavy, put heavy regime right now, right?"
"1399700","1403720"," If we continue to see calls come in the market, even if they're in the money, we continue to see"
"1403720","1408800"," us be call heavy heading into April, which we are slightly right now."
"1409420","1412780"," You're not going to see the rollovers that you've been expecting."
"1413260","1418300"," You're not going to see, unless we have real money selling come in that we don't see, you're not"
"1418300","1418940"," going to see this. "
"1419580","1421240"," This is not happening right now."
"1421400","1422880"," Now, I do see this happening."
"1423340","1424660"," We're not seeing that right there. "
"1425160","1427720"," Now, do I see something like this happening?"
"1428620","1428680"," Yeah."
"1429000","1431780"," Do I see something like maybe we trade sideways and down over here?"
"1432380","1437740"," But do I think we come down here, bump back up, trade sideways, and then head down towards middle"
"1437740","1438180"," enemy?"
"1438560","1438880"," Sure."
"1439380","1441360"," But this here, right here, it's not this. "
"1441620","1445300"," It's not going to be, we're having a fucking face melting fucking sell-off today."
"1445940","1449460"," No matter what fucking Twitter is telling you, that ain't happening."
"1449660","1450360"," It ain't happening today. "
"1450980","1451660"," It ain't happening tomorrow."
"1452220","1453040"," It ain't happening Friday."
"1453560","1455680"," Unless there's some headline news that we don't know about. "
"1456160","1459520"," We've had every fucking Fed sharing their sister come out."
"1460020","1464320"," This is a joke, but last night I'm like, we got headlines coming out on Bostik last night talking"
"1464320","1466660"," about fucking inflation, right?"
"1466960","1470960"," And finally, people on Twitter are talking about inflation, right?"
"1471080","1472720"," But they're going to fucking try to manipulate it."
"1473040","1475100"," We've been talking about that here for two, three weeks, right?"
"1476160","1477200"," You can see it. "
"1477280","1478000"," We all know it, right?"
"1478120","1480320"," They're going to try to fucking let inflation run."
"1480580","1481080"," We think, right?"
"1481260","1481860"," That's what it looks like."
"1482140","1486740"," Or at least that's the markets calling out the Fed on saying we think they're going to try to"
"1486740","1488880"," massage, manage inflation. "
"1490240","1494020"," We know yesterday the 10s and 2s inverted yesterday, right?"
"1494800","1496020"," I've looked at inversion charts."
"1496900","1499360"," I've seen that shit take a year and a half, two years."
"1499660","1503000"," I'm assuming that some people, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that. "
"1503380","1506240"," To see that the markets might not roll over for a year and a half, two years."
"1507040","1511220"," So if they're pumping this and they're like fucking, if it does roll over, we just pump it again"
"1511220","1512200"," for the next year or two."
"1512500","1514920"," We just abuse it for two more years or a year and a half. "
"1515160","1516420"," It looks like that's what's happened."
"1516420","1517800"," Or at least that's what they're telling us."
"1517800","1520480"," They've been telling us that for the past month, right?"
"1520880","1526040"," I think that's what all this is right here, that they realize that even if a recession is coming,"
"1526040","1527600"," that it's not today. "
"1528040","1530400"," It's more than likely a year, two years down the road."
"1530900","1535440"," As a matter of fact, last night I was talking to a friend of mine last night."
"1536400","1538120"," And I mentioned to him, I said, you know what?"
"1538300","1539820"," I said, several prices are coming down. "
"1540380","1543800"," And his point was, yeah, they're coming down, but it's going to take a couple of years, maybe"
"1543800","1547240"," another year and a half, two years for them to come down completely."
"1547240","1549700"," And that's one of those markets, right?"
"1549820","1556080"," If you really want to pay attention to a market for when we start to truly hit a recession, you'll"
"1556080","1557680"," start seeing fire sales on boats."
"1558360","1560200"," You're not going to see fire sales in cars. "
"1560760","1562780"," You're not going to see fire sales on houses first."
"1563220","1568320"," You'll first start to see those luxury items start to go down in price."
"1568440","1574360"," Now, his point last night was if a boat costs $100,000 and right now it costs $200,000. "
"1574960","1577580"," And so they're giving you a discount to $180,000."
"1578020","1579280"," It's not really a discount."
"1579960","1586600"," He's like, you want to wait until it comes back down to the pre-inflation prices or when there's"
"1586600","1587620"," true panic in the market. "
"1587940","1591840"," And there was a time a few years ago, well, not even a few, like four or five years ago."
"1591840","1595000"," I remember a time when you can get a sweet, you get a sweet deal in a boat."
"1595240","1598700"," As a matter of fact, the market was okay enough that you could still get deals. "
"1599080","1602260"," Like someone maybe that his boat didn't sell for a year or two."
"1602840","1606980"," And you could go in and negotiate a boat that maybe let's say a book for a quarter million dollars."
"1607200","1609880"," You could get it down to like $150,000 because it's sat. "
"1610160","1611760"," It was in the wrong country, wrong place."
"1612360","1613580"," It had never been removed from the water."
"1613800","1614880"," That's how it was fucked up. "
"1615020","1615260"," I don't know."
"1615580","1616410"," You know, it was hurricane damaged."
"1617360","1618840"," Some kind of reason you could get a deal in the boat. "
"1618960","1619800"," Right now that's not the case."
"1620020","1625680"," But now there is whispers and talk around the internet world, right?"
"1626120","1627520"," As a big internet boat community."
"1628620","1631140"," And these people are talking about prices just starting to roll over. "
"1631140","1635100"," So until you start seeing stuff like that happen, we're not in a recession yet."
"1635860","1636180"," Right?"
"1636540","1638560"," The market's not going to crash before that happens."
"1638700","1644320"," You're going to start seeing people get rid of their luxury items before or discount fire sale. "
"1644680","1646460"," Their luxury items before we get there."
"1646820","1649140"," So it was a good point that we had in the conversation last night."
"1649380","1651920"," So in the meantime, this is what we're looking for here, okay?"
"1652100","1656180"," Unless we see massive put flow, waterfall puts coming into the market. "
"1656480","1657780"," You're just looking for some dips to buy."
"1658320","1659020"," They could be right here."
"1659120","1660460"," This is resistance here. "
"1660460","1663860"," The best, the sweet by would be down here at S1 or S2."
"1664440","1670640"," And the other thing you should be doing here is looking for tickers that are up when they shouldn't"
"1670640","1670960"," be up."
"1672280","1672980"," Baba, baby. "
"1675600","1676000"," Right?"
"1676240","1678580"," Oil last night got a bid into the close."
"1678860","1680460"," We talked about USO yesterday."
"1681440","1683980"," We looked at USO and it caught a bid right down here at the bell. "
"1683980","1685080"," We talked about USO."
"1685460","1687100"," It caught a beautiful bid in here, right?"
"1687820","1691180"," And you can see we talked about XLU yesterday."
"1691920","1694160"," And that's slightly up right now, right?"
"1694660","1695500"," Slightly up. "
"1695640","1697300"," It caught up, but it did catch a bid yesterday."
"1697660","1700200"," And it also caught a continued bid at the 7419."
"1701340","1706040"," I probably wouldn't buy this, but if it does have a nice little roll and you can catch a little"
"1706040","1708240"," bid down here, it'd be kind of nice, right?"
"1709620","1711720"," If you can see a nice little bounce down here. "
"1711960","1715780"," If you see XLU roll a bit, it catches a bid down here."
"1716280","1719800"," And you can keep your eyes out in the market today and look for some..."
"1719800","1721360"," I thought I saw Twilio or something."
"1722160","1723400"," I don't know what Twilio is. "
"1726280","1729240"," It's still catching a bid, but it looked like it was catching a bid this morning."
"1729380","1730020"," Maybe it didn't."
"1730400","1731220"," It caught a bid yesterday. "
"1731540","1733040"," I might be talking about the wrong ticker this morning."
"1733640","1737060"," But there were some ticker this morning that I was watching out that was kind of up this morning."
"1737620","1740220"," You can see UU is up this morning, a bid in UU. "
"1740920","1744460"," Let's just keep your eyes open on tickers that are up this morning."
"1745540","1748460"," XLU I think is rolling over a little bit as now it's catching a bit again."
"1749140","1750720"," Let's just keep your eyes on tickers that are up. "
"1751060","1755300"," Keep your eyes on the market, continue to rotate here."
"1756500","1758860"," And before the market begins to roll over you."
"1758960","1763760"," If you keep seeing the rotation in the market, I mean just not technically going to roll over at"
"1763760","1764200"," this point. "
"1764740","1770100"," You can also see this morning that there's not a lot of volume in the market this morning."
"1770480","1772800"," So I'm not going to expect many moves today."
"1772800","1775100"," You can see some support here at 460. "
"1775920","1776900"," We'll look a little bit lower."
"1777440","1780960"," And you can see this volatility heading all the way down here."
"1781460","1785580"," We'll just keep, we can still see the buyers buying dips down here still this morning. "
"1786860","1788200"," 458 still buyers."
"1788740","1794800"," And you'd want to see a break of let's say 458, 457 for your first drop today."
"1796500","1799040"," You get some more buyers down here at 457, 20. "
"1800340","1802780"," 456 seems to be with a big monies that down here."
"1804260","1807480"," Take another look in 455 more buyers."
"1807700","1808900"," There's lots of buyers down in here. "
"1809100","1811500"," So be looking for a dip data buy."
"1811920","1813120"," We'll get back here."
"1813460","1814220"," And we'll look at the spy. "
"1816440","1817680"," Maybe just a second here."
"1820440","1822540"," Yeah, this market's not ready to roll just quite yet."
"1822760","1825600"," So there's buyers in there. "
"1827240","1828600"," So we'll take a look at the spy here."
"1828720","1830840"," And it looks like there's still buyers stepping in here."
"1831280","1835060"," And we'll also take a look at IWM because there could be some rotation out of you. "
"1835140","1835700"," We'll take a peek."
"1836500","1837500"," We'll keep an eye on this one."
"1837580","1839880"," That's not a big, big power move back over here. "
"1840480","1841440"," Now let's keep an eye on this."
"1841620","1844360"," We'll keep an eye on this down here and see if we can find a bid."
"1844660","1846440"," Now otherwise, what would I say to you?"
"1847320","1848620"," What would I say to you?"
"1849060","1855160"," Your best bet if you were to take a trade today is probably an iron condor or a butterfly of"
"1855160","1857480"," some sort, probably a condor or capture the best. "
"1857860","1861820"," You can do daily condors because we've got opexes for the rest of the week."
"1861840","1863160"," You do a condor every single day."
"1863520","1868480"," Try to capture a nice wide spread on these trades in the first 15 minutes of each day. "
"1868580","1870040"," You buy one that expires each day."
"1870440","1875680"," Otherwise, if you're a bull or bear, this might not be the place for you to be doing anything"
"1875680","1876300"," today."
"1876560","1881080"," It might just be a matter of waiting for a dip to come down for you to grab to take"
"1881080","1881840"," higher. "
"1881840","1885940"," So you've got 45, 47 over here and you've got 45 down here."
"1886240","1888640"," You know this buyer is just waiting down here to buy a dip."
"1889300","1893760"," So if you see some profit taken, if you see a slight roll over, we'll grab a trade. "
"1893980","1896520"," But otherwise, there's not much more I can recommend to you today."
"1897260","1899100"," So we're going to tell one last thing here."
"1899620","1902400"," We're going to put trade the news back on before we see how that going. "
"1904320","1909960"," And that would be, there's been a lot of questions about light last night."
"1909960","1910680"," I got asked the question."
"1910740","1911180"," I got asked. "
"1911860","1915760"," I haven't seen legal back and find out the question."
"1915860","1920960"," I was just saying publishing gold and effects reserves stayed on March 31st."
"1922140","1925000"," I'm not going to name names up there because I like the sky too, right?"
"1925280","1926560"," I like everybody out there. "
"1926600","1927480"," I like just like anybody."
"1927500","1935540"," But last night I was told I haven't seen any meaningful progress on your $1,000 to $1,000,000"
"1935540","1936800"," challenge."
"1936800","1940200"," So we have to have a conversation about that this morning. "
"1940500","1945940"," Because one of the first rules that I made for this challenge was do not fucking argue with me."
"1946680","1952020"," And the reason for that is because these trades come out once every month to three months."
"1952620","1955740"," They're not something where we're going to be talking about it every single day. "
"1956600","1958880"," The second issue that we have 15 minutes."
"1958900","1961560"," Look at the weekly d-leaf tooling inventory data."
"1962140","1965460"," Previous in the platform, a draw expected in all three categories. "
"1967480","1968860"," There was some news this morning."
"1968980","1972980"," U.S. White House reportedly considering using Emergency Production Act to develop battery metal"
"1972980","1973400"," supplies."
"1975040","1976320"," That impacts C."
"1977140","1980080"," That's probably why we got U.U. grabbing a bid this morning. "
"1980940","1981220"," Impact."
"1981600","1982160"," So let me see."
"1983500","1983940"," FXI. "
"1984160","1984320"," W."
"1984640","1985080"," R."
"1986420","1986640"," I."
"1986940","1987380"," M."
"1987620","1987660"," G."

"1992340","1992400"," M."
"1992700","1992700"," P."
"1996620","2004320"," The second part is conversation is that I don't want to get in trouble for making these trades."
"2006020","2007680"," I don't want to get in trouble for making these trades."
"2008480","2010960"," I don't want to attract unwanted attention. "
"2011500","2013340"," I don't want to get fated by hedge funds."
"2014240","2016280"," I don't want too many people involved in it."
"2018500","2021660"," that we could create an actual call wall on the market. "
"2022300","2027640"," If we place the trades, if you don't place the trades properly, we could create our own call wall."
"2028080","2032060"," If you look at a, like JPM puts a huge collar on for like $50 million, a lot of people"
"2032060","2033160"," follow that same collar."
"2033740","2036880"," So there are, you know, there are trades out there that are hundreds of millions of dollars. "
"2037620","2041900"," But I have too many people following along with this to become a shit show fast."
"2042820","2046580"," So when I'm being asked questions like that, well, first of all, when we're going to make these"
"2046580","2048199"," trades, they're very rare."
"2048739","2049520"," They're very rare. "
"2050000","2051300"," You're not going to see them often."
"2051520","2058100"," This is a way for you to stay in this market, to be a profitable trader, to make or to"
"2058100","2062639"," have a separate account that you always are making money on so that you can foray into being a"
"2062639","2064219"," degenerate gambler elsewhere."
"2065340","2066440"," So you're not going to see it. "
"2066739","2071699"," You're not going to see announcements from me or talking about it seven days a week."
"2071940","2077520"," You're only going to see as we get closer that we'll start discussing when there's a market"
"2077520","2079360"," liquidation that we can buy."
"2079820","2083340"," We're also going to miss some great trades in this trading plan. "
"2084139","2086139"," So I don't want to hear any shit about that either."
"2086360","2088380"," Like I don't want to hear, hey, Cap, we're going to keep going up."
"2088659","2094239"," Like this is supposed to be a way for you to consistently make money and you have to cut out"
"2094239","2095960"," when it does go against you, right?"
"2096040","2098240"," Or the risk of these trades going against you. "
"2099200","2101880"," And so I think like rule number two is just don't fucking argue with me."
"2101880","2107500"," So if I'm not showing you enough out there, if you're not getting in fast enough, I don't else to"
"2107500","2107920"," say to you."
"2108160","2114380"," The next part of this conversation is just getting you guys inside of this private handle. "
"2114380","2118960"," I have to go through and check every single person trying to get in and make sure that I know"
"2118960","2119540"," who they are."
"2119780","2122360"," I'm not just going to let in anybody off the fucking street."
"2123100","2124140"," No, no hedge funds. "
"2124140","2125720"," I'm trying to keep hedge funds out."
"2125940","2128880"," Bots out and trying to keep people with known profiles out."
"2129600","2131860"," People with like two fucking followers I'm not letting them in. "
"2131900","2134880"," I'm sorry, unless I know you or you say, hey, Cap, I'm so-and-so."
"2135260","2136660"," No, you're not getting in either."
"2136900","2137980"," So I have to know who you are. "
"2138320","2142200"," I have to make sure that your profile, you've either been around for a while."
"2142580","2143820"," You don't have two fucking followers."
"2144120","2145920"," You never made a single post in your entire life. "
"2146260","2149100"," Except for today, once I say this, no, you're not getting in."
"2149720","2150900"," I have to know who you are."
"2151000","2152560"," I have to have some kind of relationship with you. "
"2154000","2156800"," And these trades are very rare."
"2157000","2157700"," They're not every day."
"2157700","2160700"," They're literally once every month to three months. "
"2161180","2162860"," And we're not near a trade yet."
"2163460","2168600"," And the time that it takes for me to gather all this information, let you guys in there."
"2169360","2175340"," And then I have a video, I made a video last night for one of the original founders of this"
"2175340","2175880"," group, right?"
"2177660","2180340"," Chaz actually made him a video explaining it to him. "
"2180820","2181940"," A private video for him."
"2182800","2186500"," I should make it an invite only so you can all can just watch that video."
"2186940","2191340"," But I have to make a video so that everybody understands how to make these trades. "
"2191920","2193320"," Like number one, it's how to make these trades."
"2195080","2198080"," It's how often we make these trades, why we're making these trades."
"2198300","2201380"," Like all the internal reasons why we're doing this. "
"2201880","2205260"," So I still, I still, I have, I did make this video last time, but I gotta make one directed"
"2205260","2206300"," to all of you that are in."
"2207400","2209760"," So that right there is gonna take, I have to do that today."
"2210720","2213280"," Just screening people to get in takes a day. "
"2213700","2215240"," They even deleted yesterday's video."
"2216220","2219060"," Livestream yesterday because it's too public."
"2219060","2220220"," It's too much attention. "
"2220900","2221920"," And I don't want the attention."
"2222300","2223620"," I'm sorry, I don't want the attention."
"2225220","2226980"," And you can't show everybody. "
"2227320","2231740"," So if there's a small enough group that can watch this, they can."
"2232120","2239120"," I don't want to get in trouble for being told like, hey, you told Bob out there that you can"
"2239120","2240660"," make a thousand to a million dollars."
"2241260","2244200"," And to be honest with you, I'd prefer you don't even trade it. "
"2244200","2245580"," You just paper trade it with me."
"2245980","2250540"," It's so that you can at least just learn how to consistently make money in the market and then do"
"2250540","2251080"," it on your own."
"2253260","2257200"," The only comment that I had about that the other day was I know you guys make worst trades than"
"2257200","2258180"," that every day of the week. "
"2258500","2259040"," I do too."
"2259660","2261360"," I'm known to make some shitty trades."
"2261520","2263840"," I'm known to make gambling trades in the market. "
"2264360","2266160"," But that's not the only way that I trade."
"2266740","2270920"," And I know that I've also had comments in the past saying, pick up, I don't want the day in,"
"2270980","2271280"," day out."
"2271400","2273140"," I want something that's like one, three months out. "
"2273740","2274520"," Here it is."
"2275040","2277720"," So this is the way that you trade one to three months out."
"2278340","2280340"," It's not going to be every day. "
"2280860","2282840"," You're just not going to hear it about it every day."
"2283340","2288560"," You're going to place the trade and come back and it should limit sell at some point down the road."
"2288580","2292420"," So even when you place the trade, there's another month sometimes, could be weak. "
"2292880","2295800"," Sometimes it's a month you're waiting for that trade to actually finish."
"2296880","2300140"," You guys here are oftentimes on Twitter about the JPM caller, right?"
"2300280","2302260"," They talk about the JPM caller every quarter."
"2302260","2305780"," Takes an entire quarter for that to play out, right?"
"2306240","2307580"," So it's a long conversation. "
"2308000","2311340"," It's something that takes time for those trades to pay."
"2312140","2314620"," And so just be just, I guess I'm asking for patience."
"2314920","2321620"," Sweden going to be selling one and three quarter billion in 2032 bonds and 750 million crona and"
"2321620","2325160"," 2023 bonds on April 6th. "
"2325280","2325620"," That's Sweden."
"2326520","2328660"," So I guess that point is that I'm asking for some patience."
"2329380","2331600"," I'm asking for some patience while I set it up. "
"2332640","2337620"," Yes, you have to have some kind of a, you have to like either know people here in the stream"
"2337620","2339240"," that you talk to and you interact with."
"2339580","2344080"," You have to like know people at Discord, you have to know people on Twitter or institutions from"
"2344080","2348700"," using foreign software and critical infrastructure beginning 2025."
"2350100","2354900"," You know, if they interact on Twitter or be positive or trying to help people or you're getting"
"2354900","2360460"," help or whatever out there, it just can't be like some rants, no offense that he ran in people out"
"2360460","2360540"," there. "
"2360620","2363120"," It was like a random person out there in Twitter that just created a Twitter account."
"2363800","2370200"," And, you know, he's actually a hedge fund or he just wants the fade or he thinks it's funny because"
"2370200","2374280"," even when I first posted this, I said, you know, this isn't something that's guaranteed to work."
"2374440","2380500"," This, even my first post on this was, look, we'll make this public at the end, well, we'll make"
"2380500","2385360"," this public to show whether it works or not, you know, we'll laugh at ourselves if it works or not. "
"2385680","2391280"," The principle behind this challenge isn't for you to make a million dollars, it's for you to learn"
"2391280","2393940"," how to consistently make money."
"2394540","2396420"," And these trades are actually boring."
"2396980","2403080"," These trades are some of the safest option trades that you can take in this market where a shit ton"
"2403080","2407380"," of you are out there buying fucking zero dates, you're buying weeklies, you're buying just fucking"
"2407380","2407580"," blind. "
"2408280","2414040"," There's a whole subreddit on Reddit devoted to fucking retards buying fucking GME at 300 bucks."
"2414700","2421160"," In no offense, I bought GME, I think, my first time was like $14 and then $25."
"2421720","2427540"," So, and I realized it's a movement and all that, but I don't want to fucking hear about, or I"
"2427540","2434220"," don't want to hear, I guess, about, you know, any grief or if the trade fails either. "
"2434460","2438840"," This is more for, I think I'm only doing this for another year or so, and I want to be"
"2438840","2444200"," able to give something back to the community where you guys learn one of the best tools you can"
"2444200","2447260"," learn, which is how to consistently make money in this market."
"2447680","2453100"," Not just buying the Tesla dip or not just buying the stock as you love it, but I know that"
"2453100","2457300"," a lot of you out there want to change your lives and your struggle."
"2458000","2460160"," And I don't want you to struggle anymore. "
"2460380","2465660"," I want you to be able to make consistent money, know when to buy the market, and then you can"
"2465660","2470700"," go off and fucking piss it all away on zero date gambling calls on the market, okay?"
"2471300","2472400"," So, I guess that's my point."
"2472400","2477000"," Sorry for the rant this morning, but I'm getting a lot of eat, like I'm getting DMs up the ass,"
"2477040","2481580"," I'm getting blasted in comment sections from people I don't even know."
"2482040","2483020"," Like, I don't even know you. "
"2483160","2488140"," I'm like, I don't know why I'm getting blasted in a request to be let in."
"2488520","2493220"," I've only got so many hours in the day, I was working on the Discord last night, after hours, I"
"2493220","2497820"," was working with a long time follower last night, I was working with some other followers last"
"2497820","2498120"," night."
"2498500","2501380"," I was trying to have a conversation with mods that spend their days. "
"2501760","2506760"," We got like four or five kick ass mods that are spending all their time in Discord on YouTube, all"
"2506760","2511520"," over the place trying to help out the community, and then I'm getting blasted in comments like, let"
"2511520","2512520"," me in right fucking now."
"2512780","2514240"," I get it, I get it, I get you wanna get in."
"2514600","2520080"," But I understand, 100%, but just give me some breathing room here, so that I can work through"
"2520080","2523180"," everybody and get you into the trading room, okay?"
"2523640","2524440"," Now, to take these trades. "
"2525380","2529680"," I just wanna make sure everybody that's there is there for the right reasons, everybody's there to"
"2529680","2532880"," learn how to make money consistently in the market."
"2533540","2536360"," This isn't like a joke trade that we're doing."
"2536800","2541760"," This isn't like the normal $1,000 million challenges that you see from some scam, scammer trying to"
"2541760","2544580"," pump your money or take your money from you or charge you for some. "
"2545100","2552620"," This is actually, I made the, I guess that's, maybe that's one of those, like a clickbait title to"
"2552620","2556180"," it, but it's how you actually consistently make money in the market."
"2556180","2562120"," And I think that most of you that learn this system won't even complete the challenge."
"2562360","2567180"," I think that a lot of you will get, I know that when I first started trading, it became, it"
"2567180","2570880"," was more difficult every time I traded more money, where I would get scared, right?"
"2570980","2572140"," And I don't wanna bet $10,000. "
"2572640","2573680"," I don't wanna bet $20,000."
"2574080","2575040"," I don't wanna bet $300,000."
"2575480","2577880"," I mean, some of you out there are like, well, I do it all the time and I'm like, well,"
"2577980","2578420"," how do you do it?"
"2578480","2581800"," And they're like, well, I bought $100,000 in Apple stock or Tesla stock. "
"2582020","2586720"," I'm like, well, that's not placing a fucking $100,000 bet though on Tesla calls, is it?"
"2587020","2588300"," And it's not, it's different."
"2588600","2595240"," So this is more geared to just teach you guys how to consistently make money, know when to buy a"
"2595240","2599040"," market safely, ish, safe, safe, ish."
"2600240","2602860"," And the other thing is, this is a 100% challenge. "
"2603240","2605640"," So we're doing this to build accounts for new traders."
"2606060","2609320"," So we're starting with $1,000, it's 100%, 100%, 100%."
"2609320","2614160"," But under normal circumstances, you would make this trade with like 10% of your account. "
"2614740","2616000"," You wouldn't do 100%."
"2616000","2620420"," You would take, you know, 10% of your accounts and you would make these trades consistently because"
"2620420","2627600"," even over time, I've back tested this and back tested this, it should print like nine times out of"
"2627600","2628740"," 10, 10 times out of 10."
"2629460","2634020"," There's only very rare events where they don't actually print, very rare. "
"2634520","2636360"," We're talking over decades that they don't print."
"2636720","2638920"," So we might have a hiccup along the way."
"2639000","2641840"," If we don't have a hiccup along the way, it should actually print. "
"2641840","2646080"," But I don't even know if we get to the 10 trades because, you know, when I was a new"
"2646080","2650200"," trader, if I made $100,000 or $200,000, I'd be out."
"2650740","2651940"," I'm like, fuck you, I'm out of here."
"2652540","2653700"," I got the lesson, I'm gone. "
"2654660","2655520"," I'll see you next year."
"2655800","2656640"," That's how I used to be."
"2656940","2658440"," I've been there, so I know. "
"2659260","2660540"," So just keep, easy."
"2662060","2663000"," We'll make that trade."
"2664120","2668000"," I'll let you guys in and just give me some breathing room here. "
"2668200","2672820"," So what I'm thinking I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just leave on trade, the news at this point."
"2673380","2679120"," I'm gonna leave on a book map for you this morning because I think this is gonna be kind of"
"2679120","2681100"," a slow trading day, believe it or not."
"2682480","2685660"," And this is gonna be, take profit day for big institutions. "
"2686760","2687860"," You'll come down to a dip."
"2688760","2690520"," You guys have the chart for today, right?"
"2690720","2691420"," For dips to buy."
"2692680","2694140"," If we can get down to one of these dips to buy. "
"2694720","2696060"," Be careful of day traders out there."
"2696160","2701520"," What I think I'm gonna do is I'm not gonna life, stream up with trade the news going, book map"
"2701520","2702300"," going for you."
"2702640","2708280"," If there are any parts of the market where we've got some pivots to watch, I'll jump back on. "
"2708640","2714140"," What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sign off myself and I'm gonna work on getting you guys inside of"
"2714140","2714720"," that handle."
"2714720","2718280"," It's in the government saying they will allow rationing by retailers."
"2719220","2720200"," But it takes time. "
"2720380","2723760"," You know, this stuff takes like, this stuff takes hours and hours, believe it or not."
"2723860","2724840"," I know it doesn't seem like it does."
"2725520","2730120"," If I was just making videos every day, like I made an hour long video or a 45 minute video"
"2730120","2732160"," for you, that is nothing. "
"2732300","2734820"," That shit takes like an hour."
"2735200","2738620"," Like when I put out a, when I, when the morning, when I put out a, like a typed up"
"2738620","2745600"," pre-market report or an end of the day report or anything like that, that shit takes like an hour,"
"2745820","2748220"," two hour, maybe an hour or two of due diligence."
"2749200","2752340"," Three hours max on a really busy day or busy week. "
"2753300","2755060"," Maybe it's three hours every day of the week."
"2755660","2759060"," But when you're live streaming and then trying to run all this other stuff, do this stuff's"
"2759060","2762960"," consuming like, it's like, it's like 13 hours a day right now."
"2763020","2764400"," It's really consuming a lot of time. "
"2764720","2767360"," And I don't mind the time, but it just needs some patience."
"2768720","2770500"," It just needs a little bit of patience in my comment."
"2770760","2772100"," Like the comments and the DMs are wild. "
"2772800","2776660"," Like hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of DMs and comments."
"2777900","2780540"," Just, I'm getting blown up and I can't get blown up."
"2780680","2781000"," It's overwhelming. "
"2782680","2783960"," I'm a delicate flower."
"2785980","2787520"," I'm feeling overwhelmed right now."
"2789800","2791080"," I shouldn't be, but I am. "
"2793100","2798460"," Yeah, Jess, don't worry about it, bro."
"2798600","2799140"," I got you covered."
"2800160","2801480"," There's a whole bunch of you out there. "
"2801600","2803520"," I just want, if I miss any of you out there, right?"

"3260730","3263270"," Maybe they can't get away from it. "
"3263790","3270050"," I think we talked last night briefly about you fall on the rabbit holes of the markets going to"
"3270050","3270250"," burn."
"3270430","3274390"," You fall on the rabbit holes of loving a company or falling in love with a company when there are"
"3274390","3282130"," some really easy basic ways to make consistent money in this business for you to make money in this"

"3288790","3290070"," And you can piss your money away gambling."

"3303270","3310670"," And you know you can place that trade with a 90% confidence rate, 90% confidence rate. "
"3310970","3315810"," Now that trade is not easy to place because there's a lot of stress surrounding that trade."
"3316350","3321350"," And I'll explain that in the video too for you, the stress that is involved in that trade because"
"3321350","3324850"," it's almost like a blind trade that you place on the market."

"3330270","3330830"," time frame. "
"3331290","3333710"," But you know the stress that you would feel into those circumstances."
"3334550","3338190"," You'd be like I should have taken the money and run when in reality you should be diving and"
"3338190","3338450"," handing."
"3338450","3348350"," This trade actually works itself well into the concept of all the buyers show up on tops and"
"3348350","3349910"," all the sellers show up on bottoms. "
"3350170","3353210"," This trade derives from that saying."

"3400590","3401010"," euro."
"3404250","3407350"," And from there we'll start making these trades."
"3408070","3415830"," I have a feeling that after the fourth or fifth trade somewhere in there you guys won't even be"
"3415830","3417350"," interested in the live stream anymore. "
"3417630","3421830"," I have a feeling that if you're actually in that trade I think you're just going to be focused 100 "
"3421830","3423970","% on that year long trade."
"3424630","3427310"," I think we'll just get to that point where it don't matter."
"3428030","3429650"," But I'll explain a bit better. "
"3430830","3434350"," Believe it or not a majority of this move we would have missed most of it."
"3434750","3438330"," We would have had a trade in the move but we wouldn't have been in this entire move up higher"
"3438330","3440230"," because they've gotten our trade."
"3440270","3444630"," Parking thing companies are increasingly convinced that they do have pricing power. "
"3446990","3448170"," And we have another one coming up soon."
"3448830","3452950"," I'll give you any of you that are following along today, right?"
"3453930","3454970"," I did this the other day."
"3455030","3456090"," I'll give you a brief overview. "
"3456650","3457450"," It's very simple."
"3459670","3461910"," We'll just look right now and we looked at it earlier, right?"
"3462130","3462830"," The same thing."
"3463010","3463590"," I'm teasing you. "
"3463670","3465830"," I'm showing you guys every single day, right?"
"3467810","3470050"," I'm starting to bring this trade up every single day for you, right?"
"3471170","3472510"," Or at least every other day or so."
"3474230","3475630"," And just mark a breath."
"3475890","3481110"," All we're looking for is liquidation of all of the smaller, all of the components that make up the"
"3481110","3481610"," S&P 500. "
"3482670","3483670"," And we're not there yet."
"3483910","3486310"," So we're waiting for that next liquidation to take place."
"3486550","3487450"," It hasn't happened yet. "
"3488370","3489430"," We have some time."
"3490370","3491550"," I'm going to show it to you once more, okay?"
"3492090","3493250"," So just down inside of here."
"3493890","3495350"," You can see these marks right here, okay?"
"3496690","3498250"," We haven't had one yet, right?"
"3498250","3503770"," Markin saying that believes inflation will settle next year as the Fed actions take hold and excess"
"3503770","3508330"," consumer savings is spent and the supply chains ease. "
"3509470","3512650"," We can see that this market hasn't rolled over yet."
"3513010","3513890"," So we've got some time."
"3515550","3517650"," These rollovers take some time. "
"3518970","3522050"," It can take a long time for this rollover to take place."
"3522190","3524170"," It could take an entire month for this rollover to take place."
"3524170","3529610"," But we'll get this set up and we will watch the video and we'll keep an eye on when it"
"3529610","3530390"," happens next. "
"3530950","3532450"," And we will buy that dip, okay?"
"3532950","3535070"," In the moment that we see it, we're going to buy it, okay?"
"3535790","3537850"," We start to see these liquidation events."
"3538030","3543430"," We'll start taking these trades and you can take these trades typically in confidence with cost"
"3543430","3543650"," spreads."
"3543790","3548330"," The video will also include how to chart out the trade. "
"3548790","3553210"," It'll also include how to make the place an actual trade."
"3554370","3557170"," And I'm trading this on, I'm starting out with Robinhood."
"3558310","3559990"," I might move it to a different platform. "
"3560270","3561510"," You can do it any platform you want."
"3562490","3565210"," I'm doing this mostly for the new trader out there."
"3566290","3569590"," I know there are new traders that have no idea how to use anything but Robinhood. "
"3569830","3573430"," I fucking hate Robinhood, but I'm doing it for a new trader."
"3573430","3576550"," So I'm not going to, this is a no learning curve kind of a thing."
"3577810","3581430"," This is something that I have to think about a new trader out there. "
"3581530","3583070"," You guys can place these trades anywhere you like."
"3583550","3588350"," Normally I'd use tasty trade, but Robinhood seems like it'll fit the bill."
"3589070","3590230"," At least getting started. "
"3590530","3596990"," None of these trades rely too much upon the execution in the last 15 minutes, half an hour of the"
"3596990","3598190"," close on the Friday of expiration."
"3598770","3602670"," Most of these trades have been placed anywhere from one to three months on them."
"3604830","3608050"," Until they get to get the limit self filled. "
"3608810","3612810"," And we're not we're not probably more than likely not holding most of these trades into expiration."
"3614090","3615390"," The way that they're going to be structured."
"3616390","3617070"," Very simple. "
"3617250","3620550"," The only other thing I'll tell you is whatever trading platform you're on right now, you may want"
"3620550","3620810"," to."
"3622850","3626470"," You may want to ensure that you have, I think it's level three options."
"3626470","3631270"," I think it's level three is where you can trade simple spreads. "
"3632630","3637310"," And sometimes your some some of some brokerages out there will allow you to place."
"3638170","3641810"," Simple spreads and some don't unless you use a."
"3642390","3644690"," I'm not a cash company."
"3645050","3647830"," I'm coming to mind block right now. "
"3649850","3651250"," Whatever it's called doesn't matter."
"3651470","3652230"," I'll think about it later."
"3655120","3660880"," So keep a keep posted if we come into a market pivot position today right here if I see a"
"3660880","3661840"," pivot take place. "
"3662120","3666560"," If I see by the opportunity down here or we're going to break through, I'll let you know."
"3667320","3668580"," I'll step back into the live stream."

"7696240","7699800"," to just slowly roll it over down here and stair step down into the close. "
"7700220","7702820"," That's possible that we could trade down to S1 or S2."
"7703320","7704960"," I'm not anti this happening."

"7710780","7711840"," Some of you may not."
"7712060","7716260"," But this is a moment in the market where it's a good idea. "
"7716420","7721160"," Sometimes I'll talk about watching options streams all day long."
"7722540","7727640"," And what they are inferring or meaning in the background, and this is actually a prime example of"
"7727640","7728660"," something to be looking for."
"7729180","7735200"," So, you know, if I'm just sitting here looking at this chart today, to me it looks like we're"
"7735200","7736380"," getting a rollover moment, right?"
"7736520","7739980"," Markets should continue to stair step down, roll over into the close. "
"7740680","7744480"," And if you're getting like super bearish right now, you're like, well, I want to take some puts"
"7744480","7745060"," right here."
"7745520","7748140"," And I know it's going to roll over and I know they're going to print."
"7749760","7751240"," There's some things that you're looking for. "
"7751500","7757840"," This morning at the start at the top of the morning, we're talking about the gamma impact on the"
"7757840","7760000"," market right now, the pending effect in the market."
"7760400","7763720"," And I talked to you about how you shouldn't expect too much out of the market today."
"7765180","7767300"," Unless you had some headline news, right?"
"7767740","7768400"," Positive or negative. "
"7769220","7771440"," So another way you can check this right now."
"7771500","7774260"," Let's say you were like, hey, I want to pick up some puts here."
"7774900","7776800"," Or I want to pick up some shorts here. "
"7776800","7779260"," I want to start shorting the market here, right?"
"7780120","7784440"," There's a second way to identify if this is actually going to roll over."
"7784500","7786660"," There's an easy way to look and see."
"7786840","7790660"," Now, it doesn't mean we won't roll over or slowly trade down to the course of the day. "
"7791600","7798900"," But if you have some price targets in your head or you want to confirm that there's a good reason"
"7798900","7805440"," for you to bearish here, I think you want to do is take a look on an options chain for"
"7805440","7805960"," today."
"7806900","7808660"," Now, I have it on a different computer."
"7808800","7811140"," I don't have it here where I can slide it over for you. "
"7812300","7813200"," I might be able to."
"7813900","7815260"," Let me see if I can bring it up here."
"7815820","7818280"," Let me see if I can bring up an options chain here in Webull. "
"7819180","7820340"," I might be able to."
"7822100","7822740"," This is cool."
"7823180","7826560"," So, okay, so this is December 30th here, right?"
"7826800","7828320"," Let me see if I can raise this up a little bit. "
"7828740","7831260"," I don't know if I can make this full screen or not."
"7832500","7833680"," Maybe maximize right there."
"7834380","7835640"," This is a good example right here. "
"7836860","7839960"," So, today's expiry is March 30th, right?"
"7841120","7844020"," And this is only, I think this only will do all the strikes."
"7845780","7848880"," And I want to scroll down to wherever in the money is."
"7849120","7850380"," This is in the money right here, right?"
"7851240","7852980"," And I want you to take a peek at something. "
"7853820","7860000"," And what I want you to look at is these are the puts over here, right?"
"7860940","7866940"," And when you start to look down this options chain, you can see 78 cents here, right?"
"7868580","7869880"," Okay, I'm going to bring up something else."
"7869880","7871620"," I'm going to bring up another options chain somewhere else."
"7872400","7873080"," Hold on here. "
"7873500","7874120"," Give me just a quick second."
"7874120","7875480"," I'm going to take a mirror of these."
"7878760","7879760"," Just a moment here. "
"7883120","7884460"," Hold on a second here."
"7887300","7888280"," Just bear with me."
"7889980","7895320"," So, when you're looking at these first part of the chain right here, right?"
"7898130","7901110"," When you're looking at this first part of the chain right here, right?"
"7906680","7908240"," You think the market's rolling over?"
"7908580","7913180"," You can see how much the market makers are expecting a move, right?"
"7913700","7916520"," Pretty much no lower than 458. "
"7919580","7926880"," And they're putting a little bit of credence into 457, possibly 456, but they're only 14 cents."
"7927300","7928600"," These are dirt fucking cheap."
"7929280","7935980"," The implied move down, they're not expecting the market makers are not expecting a move down to"
"7935980","7936360"," 4456. "
"7937640","7940200"," Even less of a chance of 455, right?"
"7940700","7944300"," And we'll look back real quick and see where 455 is."
"7944480","7946540"," I think that's a support number two."
"7947800","7956500"," But the real juice is when you get into a deeper outside the money. "
"7956660","7963140"," When you start to look down here at, let's say 450, right?"
"7963360","7965940"," We can go to 450 over here, right?"
"7966640","7973360"," When we start looking down here and the chances of us trading below 455 are extremely low."
"7973360","7981500"," So when I talk about in stream when I say there's no premium kick in here, right?"
"7982900","7985420"," There's no one's expecting this move."
"7985580","7987160"," Now, I don't expect this move either. "
"7987420","7994940"," Now, on a day where the implied move would be larger than this very small implied move today, you"
"7994940","7997440"," would actually see these options still have some vig to them."
"7997560","8001700"," They would still have, these might be worth like 5 cents or 3 cents or 15 cents."
"8001700","8005760"," It's a big move down to move down from where we are down to 450 in one day. "
"8005820","8009000"," But you'd at least see some more vig in this move down."
"8009500","8014320"," And I've been paying attention to these options down here to see if they're going to grow a little"
"8014320","8014480"," bit."
"8014800","8017180"," And I'm not seeing anything in that move, okay?"
"8017620","8022160"," And so the key behind the point I'm trying to make to is even though the market looks like it's"
"8022160","8025540"," going to roll over, I'm looking down here left to inside. "
"8025740","8028820"," I'm like, boy, 455 is only going to get 7 cents on it."
"8029540","8031680"," Only 7 cents, right?"
"8031880","8033560"," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 strikes away."
"8034020","8036800"," You got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 strikes away. "
"8037380","8041520"," And down here is only 6 cents on a move to 464, right?"
"8041980","8044000"," We know that we probably can't get above 462."
"8045000","8047940"," But you do see a lot of vig in these like 460s."
"8048260","8052640"," You see them in slightly in 461, a little bit in 462. "
"8053820","8055280"," And the same thing goes over here."
"8055280","8059600"," 459, 438, 457 is pretty much our range for today."
"8060100","8062080"," So we can make outside moves. "
"8062080","8065880"," We can have some kind of headline news come out in the day."
"8066420","8073960"," But for today, it's looking kind of like the expectation is that this is our trading area."
"8074120","8075940"," Come up upon the noon hour here in New York City. "
"8076140","8077120"," We've got U.S. Treasury."
"8077300","8079140"," Sitting near the lowest levels of the session."
"8079140","8084960"," 3.35 in the U.S. 10 year, 2.35 in the U.S. 10 year and 2.33 in"
"8084960","8086080"," the two year yield. "
"8086220","8088360"," The U.S. Treasury is implied move."
"8088640","8089960"," 457, 462."
"8090380","8092460"," That was down about 75 points. "
"8092600","8097040"," The S&P is down 21 and the NASDAQ composite is down 88 on the day."
"8097320","8101460"," Crude futures are holding on to gains of about 3.5% in the WTI contract."
"8101960","8103840"," Now we could have something take place, right?"
"8104080","8106440"," That will make us trade outside the stream. "
"8106440","8108840"," We do have some potential more Fed speak ahead of us."
"8109060","8114220"," The FOMC voter George expected to speak at the Economics Club in New York City."
"8115520","8117820"," This is a very small tight range today. "
"8117980","8120540"," Comments expected around an hour's time."
"8121480","8123480"," Can we make larger moves at the end of the day?"
"8123780","8124600"," Sure, we can."
"8125400","8129700"," But generally speaking in the middle of the day, we're not going to expect much more than this zone"
"8129700","8130420"," in here, this area. "
"8130420","8132480"," So let's look here."
"8132560","8135140"," We have 462, 463 possibly, right?"
"8135600","8135640"," Possibly."
"8136660","8139400"," The fact that we probably won't get to 462. "
"8139920","8143720"," And then up here, the fact that we probably won't get below 457."
"8144680","8147980"," Even though I think we've got S2 at 455, right?"
"8148640","8149900"," So we'll get rid of this here."
"8150760","8154680"," And so I tried to take a peek at this stuff and see if there's more of an implied move"
"8154680","8154960"," today. "
"8155120","8155600"," There isn't."
"8155680","8157940"," And you can see here on this chart, right?"
"8157940","8159340"," 455, right?"
"8160480","8161480"," It's way down here."
"8162040","8165020"," And so they're saying to you, it's going to be a fucking hard. "
"8166140","8168260"," Fucking hard to get down here today."
"8169220","8173000"," More than likely, you know, this is probably probably the dip for the day."
"8173300","8178780"," More than likely you might catch this dip here before a bounce on S1. "
"8179480","8180600"," Before you make a move higher."
"8180840","8182300"," Oh, we trade within this zone."
"8182640","8187780"," So if you were going to trade condors, if you were going to trade butterflies, anything like that,"
"8187860","8191900"," a daily butterfly, what you talked about the start today, you're going to be looking at your"
"8191900","8196400"," options chain and looking to see what the implied move is, what they're expecting for today. "
"8197160","8200299"," And you already know that even 462 is kind of out of the way."
"8200540","8206860"," So to see or to expect something more along the lines of this."
"8208700","8211620"," And at max, maybe this into the end of today. "
"8211840","8213620"," That's not really a lot of room, right?"
"8214120","8218900"," They're not really putting a lot of faith into big moves outside of this area."
"8219059","8222700"," Now we can trade outside of this area on these extremes out here."
"8222840","8225299"," But the implication today is that we're not going to see it. "
"8225600","8229080"," And so some of you are probably out there trading right now and you're like, what the fuck is going"
"8229080","8229879"," on with the market?"
"8230600","8234000"," Like why the fuck is the market not rolling over if you're a bear?"
"8234299","8238020"," And why the fuck did this, you know, not bounce up and go crazy at least?"
"8238660","8242400"," But it's just showing that there's not a lot of movement today in the market."
"8242400","8244959"," There's a painting on the market with all the calls in the market."
"8245420","8249920"," There's some profit taking here, profit taking there, profit taking here. "
"8250620","8255780"," And you don't expect to see that this kind of a thing keep happening unless a big comes in or"
"8255780","8258520"," some headline news to make something change."
"8259180","8264879"," So without that stuff happening, this is what you're left with, is just kind of shitting the bed in"
"8264879","8265080"," here."
"8265400","8269920"," Now, if you're going to still want to trade this with calls and putts in here, the only thing that"
"8269920","8276440"," I can tell you is that I would be buying them in the money, like right at the strike, and"
"8276440","8278639"," you can only hold them for brief moments of time. "
"8279360","8282420"," You're talking like 10 minutes trades, five minute trades, 20 minute trades."
"8282959","8284639"," But I know that this moment over here."
"8284639","8292320"," It's every unemployment rate at 4.1%. I know the 4.6% expected retail sales at 5.9%"
"8292320","8294760"," year of year versus 4.4% expected. "
"8294760","8302360"," Sumer prices year to date up 8.9% some Russian data, CPI and wage as well as unemployment and"
"8302360","8305500"," retail sales figures month of February and January."
"8307100","8311180"," So the point that I'm trying to make is let's say you're bearish right now and you're like, Hey,"
"8311340","8315980"," Cap, that move, not, I guess it's going back up now, but this little move right here where it was"
"8315980","8317719"," curling over wanting to roll."
"8318299","8321860"," Or if you're bearish and you're like, Oh, yeah, that was the higher high over here. "
"8321860","8326740"," And, you know, this failed up top here and you can see it just curling, right?"
"8327000","8328740"," And it's going to roll over here."
"8329080","8330440"," You just take a look inside the implied move."
"8330620","8334360"," You can see that there's no premium leaking into the puts. "
"8334959","8340100"," You can see that no, you don't see like one penny puts down to 450 or creeping up to five"
"8340100","8340440"," cents."
"8341240","8347660"," It doesn't mean we get down to 450, but you'd at least see some premium kicking into the put side."
"8347660","8354400"," And if you're not seeing that premium kicking into the put side, it's kind of like a tell in the"
"8354400","8357020"," background telling you, fuck, no, it ain't going down. "
"8357820","8364400"," And you can actually see right now that it reversed instead of rolling over and continuing down and"
"8364400","8370559"," see instead of seeing a premium kicking in on penny options, penny puts, you can tell the market"
"8370559","8374840"," makers already know before you do that it ain't going down."
"8375660","8376360"," Makes sense."
"8377000","8384440"," And even on this rip right here, there's no kick in calls either. "
"8384740","8390120"," So their implication is that any move up will be muted."
"8390280","8392300"," It could be muted on this white line."
"8392560","8394700"," It could be muted just right up in here. "
"8395400","8398560"," But there's no expectation that we're trading outside of this zone right here."
"8398780","8403180"," So whenever you're going to start taking a position, if you can't read it on book map, you can't"
"8403180","8403880"," figure it out here."
"8404600","8405540"," There's no headline news. "
"8405820","8407600"," There's like nothing that can tell you what's really going on."
"8408320","8411420"," Do you like a back check on the options chain?"
"8411840","8413160"," Keep your eye on an options chain."
"8413860","8418740"," Take a peek at it and see if there's actually a rollover taking place here. "
"8419420","8424340"," Or if it's a fake rollover, which this happened to be."
"8424780","8427420"," And see how I timed all this when I was talking to you about it."
"8427820","8429180"," And it turned back around. "
"8430000","8430440"," Okay."
"8430520","8433140"," Seem like a good learning moment for all of you out there."
"8434520","8437100"," You guys dig it and you guys dig it. "
"8437340","8438700"," Let me know if you can dig it in the chat."
"8443660","8445260"," You guys understand what I'm saying here?"
"8446640","8448800"," You guys understand where I'm coming from here?"
"8449260","8456700"," So if you're seeing this roll over here and see this curl and you're like, I'm going to get real"
"8456700","8458080"," bearish right here, right?"
"8458280","8461120"," And you can't figure out or you want some confirmation that's going to roll over."
"8461320","8465400"," You want to be just keeping an eye in the options chain because the options chain is going to tell"
"8465400","8467540"," you before the roll actually takes place. "
"8467600","8472260"," You'll start to see money creep in to the put side for to roll over."
"8472380","8478660"," And specifically, it'll creep into options that are less expensive, like one penny, two pennies,"
"8478920","8479480"," five pennies."
"8479780","8481680"," You don't have to watch the actual in the money options. "
"8481900","8483800"," You can watch a slightly T strikes out."
"8483800","8487740"," You'll see a little creep in there and you're not seeing that creep."
"8488000","8493140"," And that is why we turned around because they already knew that we weren't going down and they're"
"8493140","8494400"," not they're not planning on it. "
"8494420","8494700"," Okay."
"8495920","8502700"," All these high math people that know what they're doing right on right on."
"8503420","8503760"," Okay. "
"8504380","8505140"," So I'll be back again."
"8505300","8508120"," I'm trying to get you guys into the into the handle right now."
"8508760","8510680"," I've been slowly going through all of your profiles. "
"8510680","8519680"," If I miss you at some point today, just reach out to me and reach out to me and"
"8519680","8521640"," we'll talk about it."
"8522180","8523900"," So I'm trying to get through you all the guys right now."
"8524700","8525400"," I'll be back. "
"8526380","8529280"," It was a good learning opportunity and actually worked perfectly."
"8596160","8597140"," Just a blink and sing."
"8597280","8602480"," You made it clear to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince that the Valley US attached to its partnership with the"
"8602480","8602800"," UAE. "
"8603940","8604420"," All right."
"8604420","8605760"," Let's talk about one other thing before I go."
"8605860","8606620"," I'm going to come back on real quick. "
"8606640","8608780"," We're going to talk about some learning today."
"8608780","8611160"," So we're going to talk about some stuff here."
"8612080","8614540"," So I'm going to bring up iron condors. "
"8615140","8615880"," We're going to bring up."
"8617220","8618880"," Time condors and butterflies."
"8620100","8620320"," Just basic. "
"8620740","8623980"," If you're a new spreads trader, this will help you."
"8624180","8624200"," Okay."
"8626200","8626720"," So here. "
"8626880","8627500"," We'll bring this over here."
"8628480","8629840"," And we're going to explain what's going on here."
"8630000","8630060"," Okay. "
"8630320","8634260"," So this is options.ai. I don't trade on this platform, but I use it for quick and dirty."
"8634880","8635580"," Will this work?"
"8635800","8638160"," As a matter of fact, you can usually trade on most brokerages."
"8638320","8640480"," You can trade these for one day, two days. "
"8641960","8643320"," Some brokerages don't allow you to do it."
"8643840","8645140"," We're going to talk about them real quick."
"8645140","8645380"," Okay. "
"8645980","8648020"," So we came into this morning, right?"
"8648980","8654860"," And before we opened, I said to you, we have an implied range this morning of 0.3%. I also"
"8654860","8659480"," said to you that that means we're not expecting a huge move in the market today."
"8659580","8660660"," It should be a slow day trade."
"8660860","8663320"," And if you see me, come on social media and tell you that. "
"8663600","8667480"," And you know that we've got an expiration today, which we do, right?"
"8668200","8669600"," You can posit some things."
"8669780","8673840"," You can say, well shit, if the implied move is tight and small unless there's big news."
"8673840","8676160"," Am I expecting you go through your roll decks, economic news?"
"8676700","8677840"," You go through what's going on with Ukraine. "
"8678120","8680700"," You think to sell, well fuck, there might not be anything happening, right?"
"8680980","8682040"," I don't know if I can trade this here."
"8682560","8684960"," This neutral for today, but we'll pretend that we can."
"8685340","8686060"," So this is for tomorrow. "
"8686160","8687020"," This is the 31st."
"8687160","8692360"," I don't think you can execute the same day neutral trades here, but I know that you can on like"
"8692360","8693000"," tasty trade."
"8693340","8696740"," I don't know if you can on Robin Hood, but I know that some of the better brokerages you can. "
"8697340","8700300"," But we'll do this for the 31st for tomorrow."
"8701620","8703100"," But it would work for today as well."
"8703120","8707300"," As a matter of fact, you could make this trade today on tomorrow's strike, but close it today. "
"8708020","8709400"," And I'm going to show you two different kinds, okay?"
"8710000","8710880"," This is an iron condor."
"8710920","8711340"," It's an iron butterfly."
"8711900","8714760"," And you guys are all like, oh shit, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with an iron condor"
"8714760","8715680"," and iron butterfly, right?"
"8716220","8720300"," Now there are some very easy ways to figure out how to buy and sell to place these trades, but"
"8720300","8721580"," we'll just take a look at them, okay?"
"8722460","8726620"," $62 for $38, $138 for a max gain of $264. "
"8727260","8728700"," Look at both so you can see what they look like."
"8728700","8730560"," This is an iron condor right here, okay?"
"8731260","8732780"," Basic simple terms, right?"
"8733120","8737020"," At the time of expiry, it just has to be within this range right here."
"8737120","8739040"," You can see this max gain in here, right?"
"8739300","8741100"," Slightly less gain if it's way up here. "
"8741180","8743930"," Association of American railroads out with their weekly traffic report."
"8744540","8749600"," Total traffic was down 3.2% to 504.8,000 total units."
"8749980","8754880"," Intermodal was down 6.2% and car loads were up less than 1%. "
"8755520","8760080"," So your implication is that between now and the 31st that we're not going to trade higher than $462 "
"8760080","8767520",".65 and we're not going to trade lower than $465.05. You can make these wings higher and lower."
"8768080","8770460"," You can edit them for 60 bucks to make 40 bucks."
"8770680","8772240"," Now I would probably take this trade today. "
"8772400","8776320"," If this was for today expiry, I don't think we're going to close lower than $455."
"8776760","8781620"," It's possible, but if I'd opened this trade at like $9.30, $9.35 or so in the morning, I"
"8781620","8786080"," bet I would have made most of this trade like 40 to 60% of this trade by like 2,"
"8786180","8786680"," 3 in the afternoon."
"8786680","8790600"," I could just close it down and take my 40% and bounce. "
"8791360","8792460"," So we've got the iron condor."
"8792560","8793960"," Then we've got the iron butterfly over here."
"8794300","8795680"," There's a little bit tighter range, right?"
"8796180","8797340"," There's a little bit tighter range in here. "
"8797460","8797920"," It has to close."
"8798460","8799400"," It has to close within."
"8800320","8801940"," We'll see what this number is. "
"8802320","8806340"," $457.50 and then a little bit tighter, right?"
"8806520","8813420"," $462.65. For today, this might have worked for the end of day today, but it'd probably safer with"
"8813420","8815220"," the iron condor over here."
"8816340","8818100"," You can edit these here, right?"
"8818280","8823140"," You can decide on where you want your calls to be placed and where you want your puts to be"
"8823140","8823400"," placed."
"8824100","8830160"," You can widen it and shorten it and it'll actually impact how much you're going to spend and how"
"8830160","8832200"," much you can make on this trade. "
"8832200","8839340"," So iron condors, butterflies, very simple."
"8839700","8844700"," You can trade these on options.ai. You can make them wider over time."
"8844860","8847480"," But a day like today, it's almost a perfect trade to some extent. "
"8848480","8851260"," You're seeing that play itself out today."
"8851620","8855300"," You're seeing a range play out today where we're just going to trade within it."
"8855700","8857200"," There's an expiry for today. "
"8857840","8861060"," Let's say you had opened one of these this morning down here."
"8861060","8866760"," You just need it to be above this 4.56 on that condor, I believe, was down here."
"8867000","8871860"," So as long as we don't close down here, you could ride this trade all day long until the last"
"8871860","8873620"," 15 minutes, then boom, cut it loose. "
"8874580","8879800"," You can actually cut parts of this trade off as well, depending upon the direction of the trade."
"8880060","8885080"," But just for a basic trader, if you're just like Joe Schmo out there learning how to trade on these"
"8885080","8892240"," slow days, start to do some research on butterflies and condors because they often do very well on"
"8892240","8892940"," ranges like this."
"8893040","8894600"," You can actually see that down here too, right?"
"8895320","8901640"," We were within a range, yet range bound yesterday to an extent, and range bound today. "
"8902040","8904080"," And theta gang is out there just murdering right now."
"8904460","8907960"," They're just straight murdering this market right now while bulls and bears are trying to lose all"
"8907960","8914540"," their money to theta gang as we make our way until we get some headline news or put waterfalls or"
"8914540","8915420"," call waterfalls."
"8915680","8917240"," None of that's come into the market right now. "
"8917880","8921460"," And you can just see this back and forth movement in the market."
"8921780","8929600"," I would don't recommend trading here, but this gives you a decent quick and dirty like, what does a"
"8929600","8931600"," condor going to do for me today or tomorrow?"
"8932660","8933980"," Where should the strikes be?"
"8934380","8938580"," So if you were to execute these, let's say in Robinhood or Tasty or whatever, you can actually"
"8938580","8945920"," change these and see what the implications would be if he did like a 4.55 strike."
"8946280","8948080"," I can't do that one yet until I change the other one. "
"8949200","8954620"," He made it like 4.54. And then you made this one 4.55 down here."
"8956240","8957640"," So you can see what the implications are."
"8957740","8961280"," And you're like, oh, you know, I'll make this one 4.65 up here. "
"8961280","8965240"," You want to make this one 4.64 up here."
"8965560","8971640"," Save the strike and you want to you just want to see it's got 60% 67% probability of"
"8971640","8971820"," winning."
"8972220","8974300"," Your masks max risk is $68. "
"8974780","8979120"," You're only gain your gains only 32, but it does give you a wider area."
"8979200","8984180"," Do you see how wide that area is here for you as long as you trade within this zone, or"
"8984180","8987120"," as long as the market only makes these moves in here, right?"
"8987520","8991140"," Ask yourself as a ask yourself, do you think we're going to 4.65 today?"
"8991140","8991800"," Fuck no."
"8992100","8995220"," Do you think we're going below 4.54 today?"
"8995900","8997060"," Probably fucking not. "
"8997240","9000200"," And you know where I can check to see if the probability of us going down here?"
"9000580","9010440"," I can look in my options chain and see that 4.64 or 4.54 strikes are worth 4 pennies."
"9010980","9014760"," There's a very low chance that we're going to trade that low today."
"9015760","9022880"," So all those probabilities start to add into my thought process, right?"
"9022960","9024020"," This is why I'm going to take this trade. "
"9024380","9027340"," You're talking about having a trade below this area here today."
"9027880","9034020"," We're going to trade all the way down here and close down here like 4.54. Do I think that's"
"9034020","9034480"," going to happen?"
"9034880","9035500"," Probably not."
"9035660","9038220"," Do I think we're going to close below this this channel today?"
"9038720","9040400"," There's a high chance that we don't. "
"9040400","9041440"," We could."
"9041900","9043600"," Anything can happen in a day."
"9043800","9045860"," Do I think that's going to happen today?"
"9046080","9046940"," Probably fucking not. "
"9048280","9049200"," Does that make sense?"
"9050260","9052380"," This is where theta gang's just murdering everybody today."
"9052640","9053800"," They're all printing money right now."
"9056720","9057380"," Hey, Willie. "
"9057500","9058060"," Good to see you brother."
"9061150","9062030"," Hope that helps."
"9067610","9073350"," Seeing some reports here circulating from the Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov appears to be"
"9073350","9075270"," commenting on the recent peace talks. "
"9077170","9081510"," Saying that in his opinion, this is the foreign minister's significant progress can be considered"
"9083870","9088770"," the key readiness to conform to a non-nuclear non-aligned status as well as understanding that the"
"9088770","9092110"," issues of Crimea and Dumbass have been finally resolved."
"9099050","9099950"," Are we getting a peace deal?"
"9113680","9116060"," I don't know if we're getting a peace deal if that news is good or not."
"9120880","9122520"," To see if Bloomberg talks about it. "
"9131170","9133550"," Yeah, I'm not seeing nothing I'm Walter Bloomberg yet either."
"9139180","9141700"," Doesn't make us comments have hit the wire just yet."
"9151210","9152310"," Hey, Willie, how are you?"
"9155690","9157970"," Yeah, peace would probably be with Selva News, Winky. "
"9161770","9163370"," That's a very fair point."
"9166670","9168010"," Two fucking funny."
"9173980","9175080"," That's too funny. "
"9176540","9178960"," This is the rumor since this is the rumor."
"9183440","9184520"," Too funny."
"9190980","9194900"," Yeah, so there's not much going on the market right now. "
"9195540","9201900"," And there are times that are better to execute these trades than there are better times times to"
"9201900","9208140"," take on a condor or a butterfly and close condor and butterfly."
"9208500","9212960"," They are one thing I don't like about those trades is sometimes they take or they're time"
"9212960","9213440"," sensitive."
"9213440","9217700"," I think that's Vega sensitive, but don't quote me on that one. "
"9217860","9221540"," I'm trying to pull this shit out of my ass because I don't trade him as much as I used"
"9221540","9223000"," to, especially how this markets been."
"9223100","9227860"," I haven't been able to trade him often, but whenever you see people come out and say that's that"
"9227860","9232680"," whenever they're starting to tell you that they make it sideways and down, right, paid sideways and"
"9232680","9237400"," that doesn't always work, but that perks up the errors of the traders when you when they're looking"
"9237400","9244700"," for consolidation or a very low volatility days with an implied move that's very, very small."
"9245460","9248960"," And there's no expectation of a move for the next one, one to three days. "
"9249000","9253180"," You'll start to see theta gang start sniffing around for those trades."
"9262200","9267500"," Yeah, I can do something I can go some into implied volatility and the VIX, but it's more"
"9267500","9269600"," complicated than right now at this time."
"9271120","9272640"," And the implications of it. "
"9273960","9279940"," Mostly as a trader, what you really need to know is what the IV is day in day out and"
"9279940","9288200"," how it affects the VIX, the gamma impact on an implied volatility and the gamma regime and then of"
"9288200","9292900"," course, volatility triggers in the market are all basics that can be used."
"9294140","9300780"," As a matter of fact, if you if you don't understand just those basic concepts and you walk around"
"9300780","9304180"," saying, yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to roll the market over today."
"9304960","9306920"," I've seen some of that on Twitter, right?"
"9307060","9310480"," We're going to roll this market over yesterday and today and I'm like, they ain't happening. "
"9311240","9314220"," We just ain't happening without certain things happening."
"9315400","9317980"," You need more triggers for it to happen then."
"9318600","9320280"," Yeah, the market's top ever. "
"9320380","9322320"," It's been 12 straight days up."
"9322400","9323420"," It's not going to do it anymore."
"9323740","9325660"," It's like, no, they definitely can keep going up. "
"9327260","9332420"," You need more, more technical things to take place for the market to actually roll over."
"9332420","9335400"," And that involves IV and the VIX and volatility."
"9335960","9338020"," Actually, the VIX can keep dropping here, believe it or not. "
"9338460","9339520"," The VIX can go lower."
"9339860","9345420"," If you had more bidding coming into the market, you could see the VIX roll farther over."
"9346400","9347040"," I don't think that it will. "
"9347140","9351920"," That's why it's trading sideways because it's just waiting for an implied move."
"9352020","9359820"," It's waiting for lots of put buying or lots of call buying or calls or puts to roll off the"
"9359820","9359980"," market."
"9359980","9366440"," Right now, we're looking at calls rolling off the market as Friday approaches without a continued"
"9366440","9367180"," bid in the market. "
"9370840","9371660"," I'll be back."
"9372980","9379200"," I'm going to go back to going through people's profiles and trying to get them into the trading"
"9379200","9379520"," handle."
"9409680","9415600"," One other note too is just as a heads up that note. "
"9415600","9422540"," There is one underbelly kind of a thing that I am noticing and that is that there's lots of puts"
"9422540","9423920"," coming in on XLU."
"9424340","9426140"," They've been coming in all morning long."
"9426560","9428300"," We had a bid in XLU up here. "
"9428900","9431360"," There could be some roll over here in XLU."
"9431480","9433780"," I don't ever like seeing XLU rolling over."
"9434060","9438920"," This can either imply that the market is going to head up due to a bid in tech and stuff"
"9438920","9439360"," like that. "
"9439740","9444240"," Risk on type or components of the S&P 500."
"9445660","9452020"," It can also XLU rolling over could be an implication that the market is ready to roll over as well."
"9452520","9459920"," I try to watch XLU and XLF for underneath the surface kind of stuff. "
"9460140","9462480"," You can see the small roll over here in XLF."
"9463140","9465840"," You can see the small roll over here in XLU as well."
"9467340","9472480"," These are two that I'm looking for to see if the market is looking like it's rollish. "
"9472940","9474780"," I'm going to roll over on the market."
"9475800","9479580"," Then I'll also take a look at NDX and see if it has a bid in it or not."
"9480560","9481600"," It's the NASDAQ. "
"9481800","9482760"," NASDAQ is looking healthy."
"9483360","9485840"," This is a counter to XLF and XLU."
"9485980","9488600"," Usually the U-commissioning furnace in the market isn't healthy right now. "
"9488700","9490340"," Just looks like it's rolling at this point."
"9490480","9493220"," It doesn't look extremely unhealthy at this moment."
"9493860","9496940"," They have cleared the non-French parts of the CNC. "
"9498000","9502320"," See the market internals."
"9502420","9507440"," If they're telling a different story than what's going on."
"9508260","9511680"," Still a bid, some consolidation of bid in USO at this moment. "
"9512540","9516760"," There's a bid in consolidation in BNO as well."
"9518020","9522180"," Not no moves made yet, but just sideways as well, market wide."
"9537040","9538160"," Quiet day in the stock market. "
"9791430","9796470"," What is saying that President Biden informed President Zelensky today that the US intense revived"
"9796470","9800170"," Ukraine government with $500 million in direct budgetary aid?"
"9915180","9917920"," Yeah, so the puts on XLU there for June."
"9918540","9920260"," There's some puts on XLF right now."
"9921060","9923120"," April 22nd, 38p. "
"9924720","9927480"," XLU June 17th, 70p."
"9928200","9929240"," $69,000."
"9932140","9934980"," XLU June 17th, 70p. "
"9938120","9942520"," Seems like some of the spy puts are for now coming in for April."
"9944020","9948620"," Then some puts on early April 1st."
"9949020","9950360"," Looks like lots of put loading. "
"9951460","9954360"," Some calls on SOFI earlier."
"9957140","9957860"," Take a look here."
"9958000","9960180"," Lots of April, like April 1st. "
"9963620","9964460"," Take a look in here."
"9974880","9977980"," There's a rash of Rivian puts that came out earlier as well."
"9979960","9981260"," I'll take a look over right now. "
"9981340","9986040"," If you guys are watching in Discord, we'll take a look at the number of puts in here."
"9986040","9986820"," There's 6.2 million calls out there."
"9988300","9991020"," It gets 6.2 million calls in the spy. "
"9991500","9993180"," 4.2 million puts on the spy."
"9994400","9997600"," Zoom has one big fat call order."
"10000040","10002660"," 617 105C for $5.3 million. "
"10003880","10005800"," Usual Tesla bulls out in force."
"10006860","10010300"," Apple bulls, AMD, QQQs, Misfit."
"10010500","10012320"," Let's see if we can find it again usual in here though. "
"10012320","10015820"," Nvidia is starting to become very much like Tesla."
"10016920","10023520"," But there's some calls here on IW0819275C for $1.5 million."
"10024320","10025440"," That's unusual flow. "

"10169570","10170550"," They could be wrong about AAL."
"10171230","10173610"," Sometimes they would see mixed these up and winky yells at me."

"10207130","10210470"," You tell me if you like hearing this in Discord. "
"10210470","10219070"," I'll toggle the voice alerts and you guys can hear every time options or option flow comes out."
"10219210","10221410"," You can listen to it in Discord if you don't want to watch it."
"10222570","10224230"," So I'll toggle that on for you. "
"10224450","10226190"," Let me know if it bothers you or bugs you."
"10226370","10228750"," Let me know in the chat of YouTube if it pisses you off."
"10229210","10230530"," I think you can just mute it too. "
"10231370","10238130"," But it should verbally speak the options flow specifically for the day."
"10244360","10245380"," Well, I got it right, Winky."
"10247320","10250980"," I was like, is this Alcoa or is this American Airlines?"

"10252060","10255040"," I'm like, which AA company is this that I'm talking about right now?"
"10258990","10261230"," I've seen that happen before on tickers."
"10261710","10264370"," I forget some of them, but there's a few tickers out there."
"10264410","10270230"," There are so close to other tickers that I've seen people fuck up and bid up the wrong ticker. "
"10272830","10274390"," Discord has a lot of background noise."
"10276290","10277690"," Is it my background noise?"
"10281260","10282160"," Because it could be me."
"10283840","10286780"," Let me see if I can, I don't know if I can mute my microphone. "
"10288460","10289240"," Not the screen."
"10290120","10290400"," Let's see."
"10291980","10293360"," This video chat's not available. "
"10295460","10296740"," There's a lot of you in there today, right?"
"10298020","10299260"," Let me see if I can hear anything."
"10303480","10305560"," I'll listen into the chat and see what you're talking about."
"10308320","10309360"," I'll listen in right now. "
"10311740","10313220"," And see if I can hear anything."
"10316720","10319280"," But when one of these come in, it should it should verbalize it."
"10319280","10323020"," It should be like so five four or April 14th 12 C."
"10324680","10325400"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. "
"10330820","10332220"," It's people with unmuted mics."
"10334640","10335580"," All right, I'll be right back."
"10335680","10342340"," I'm going to go back to trying to approve people in the trading sub. "
"10404600","10406720"," I think so you just heard her voice."
"10407080","10407640"," You just heard the."
"10440320","10448080"," Yeah, if you guys like just by consensus, if you want to hear the AI speak the options flow as"
"10448080","10449560"," it comes out, I can leave it on. "
"10449900","10454540"," If you don't like it, I will mute whatever her name is."
"10456380","10458720"," I don't know, like the Siri knock off or whatever."
"10459240","10460800"," We'll give her a stupid name of some kind. "
"10485010","10486390"," I can't listen to her voice."
"10486570","10487350"," I just like reading it."
"10487650","10491030"," Like if I had to listen to that all day long, I'd like to shoot myself in the head. "
"10493230","10494270"," Yeah, I turned it off."
"10495210","10495570"," It's annoying."
"10496990","10501210"," I think I used to try to listen to it and then it just would fade into the background rather"
"10501210","10503010"," than just reading the flow as it comes through. "
"10510190","10512030"," All right, I'll make a poll in the discord."
"10553960","10555440"," Yeah, I put my mic on it."
"10555620","10562620"," Sometimes I forget to put I have a second microphone that is is inside of the discord. "
"10562820","10566800"," I had people request for me to put my mic for a phone on the discord."
"10567500","10570180"," I guess you can mute me in the discord."
"10570420","10570720"," I don't know. "
"10570780","10574020"," I guess somebody were trying to listen to me in the discord, but they couldn't hear me or wanted a"
"10574020","10577280"," faster audio so they're muting their YouTube."
"10578800","10580020"," I don't know what you guys want."
"10580340","10581640"," I'll mute my mic again. "
"10583300","10584260"," You know what I'll do is this."
"10584500","10594220"," I'm going to I'll take I'll take two polls in discord or on Twitter and ask you guys if you"
"10594220","10596340"," prefer to hear me hear the microphone."
"10597020","10601320"," I guess some people are listening or some people watch me on YouTube and want to hear the voice"
"10601320","10602500"," because there's no delay. "
"10604240","10610400"," Though if you are watching me on YouTube, you can just hit the fast forward button and it'll catch"
"10610400","10611460"," right up to no delay."
"10611660","10614120"," You'll have a zero like one second delay from live."
"10615100","10616180"," You can beat that. "
"10616620","10619020"," I guess we were trying to hear me speak in discord as well."
"10620640","10625120"," So what I'll do is I'll put two polls out later today on Twitter so I can get everybody's"
"10625120","10625640"," everybody's."
"10626920","10629580"," Input on that and then we'll just go with whatever the group thinks. "
"10630660","10632240"," So you guys can meet me wherever you want."
"10632360","10635820"," You can mute me on discord or or YouTube or whatever."
"10636320","10637840"," Just so you don't just see no out there. "
"10638080","10643080"," There's a little if you're watching me on YouTube for the first time and you don't like it delay"
"10643080","10646300"," and the information as it comes out, especially if it's critical or market critical."
"10647380","10651800"," You can just go down to the I think it's the gear icon on YouTube."
"10651800","10655520"," Click on it and you speed up the broadcast. "
"10656000","10661860"," I'll sound funny for the first minute or minute and a half or so and then it'll come into real"
"10661860","10662200"," time."
"10662500","10667280"," Someone was explaining a few some of the smarter people here have explained that YouTube"
"10667280","10674480"," intentionally will delay the live stream by 15 seconds, but you can get it instant as it happens"
"10674480","10678880"," within a minute a second or two as it's broadcast if you just speed it up."
"10678880","10682160"," And then then my voice turns back to normal sounding. "
"10684560","10685940"," Alright, I gotta go back to a."
"10686740","10688340"," You don't know how to turn the voice on."
"10688540","10690880"," I turned the voice off for now to I'll run a."
"10692320","10693220"," I'll run a."
"10696220","10700800"," A poll later on today, but if you want to know how to turn your voice on or how you"
"10700800","10701120"," listen."
"10703980","10708880"," Or how you listen in then you just I think when you join a room you just click on your"
"10708880","10716160"," little icon your name and then it gives you the options of muting yourself or or listening or"
"10716160","10718280"," muting the sounds in the in the room. "
"10719780","10723360"," It's actually kind of funny listening to some people with their with their unmuted mics in there"
"10723360","10725720"," because I've heard all kinds of crazy as conversations."
"10727440","10731420"," And I don't think most people know that they're they've got their mics on so they're just like in"
"10731420","10735800"," there hanging out their families and friends in a chit chat in the background or work or whatever."
"10737320","10742740"," I found it humorous I didn't put it, you know, but I'm sure that it's annoying over time if you"
"10742740","10743880"," have to listen to it all day long. "
"10744920","10748240"," Someone's back and I'm sure some people get embarrassed because they don't even know that they're"
"10748240","10752720"," they've got a hot mic in their house or their office or wherever they're at."
"10752720","10753780"," So be right back."
"10756620","10758040"," 1241 in the in the hour. "
"10758620","10760780"," I'm going to say if I can see anything in news here."
"10763700","10768580"," Only I'm seeing here is a cash carry a dove a non voter saying the yield curve gives you useful"
"10768580","10770580"," feedback on policy versus neutral."
"10773480","10774540"," You see here. "
"10775420","10779840"," You know, you know, I came to saying they had to they have power in place to place new legal"
"10779840","10785500"," powers were enrolled Russian oligarch access to UK aviation and maritime technical services."
"10786660","10793820"," A big one there Biden is saying that he told President Zelensky the US will provide $500 million in"
"10793820","10795220"," direct budgetary aid to Ukraine."
"10795920","10797420"," I think he's already done a couple billion, right?"
"10797640","10799420"," So that's he's just keeps pumping it up. "
"10801200","10803400"," I don't see much more right now."
"10807160","10812520"," Now there were some market internals from earlier at 12 p.m. New York Stock Exchange volume is 287"
"10812520","10813400"," million shares."
"10813400","10816000"," 3% below its three month average. "
"10816220","10817840"," Decliners lead advances slightly."
"10819120","10820020"," Nasdaq volume."
"10821020","10825100"," 2.41 billion shares 14% above its three month average. "
"10825900","10827920"," Decliners lead advances slightly."
"10828720","10831360"," VIX index is up 3.4% to 1950."
"10831880","10832620"," That was at 12 o'clock. "
"10833200","10834600"," It's roughly right there still."
"10834880","10836780"," What's a 1949 currently."
"10838800","10842900"," We'll take I'll try to load up in the background here and see I'll check the breadth indicator here"
"10842900","10845520"," and see if we're getting any kind of a role in the market. "
"10845520","10847640"," It didn't seem like it was much this morning."
"10848880","10849800"," Just more rotation."
"10850480","10854820"," You know, this trade I've heard some people say that this trade you can see the market go sideways"
"10854820","10856620"," and slightly up for the next couple weeks. "
"10856620","10861540"," There's actually two to four weeks left to this trade in the market."
"10864300","10868380"," That that would be soul crushing right to some of you out there if you saw the market trade"
"10868380","10869740"," sideways for a week or so."
"10870360","10876400"," I think the implication would be that you'd see you see something like this right here. "
"10877880","10882400"," If we continue to see rotation in the market, you'd see more of a move like this."
"10884870","10888830"," Sideways move like that or even like this where you have like a down day and some up days like"
"10888830","10891890"," something like this as as the breath declines slightly."
"10891890","10895830"," Rather than this this this peak here where you see this complete rollover. "
"10896010","10897210"," I think that's what people are expecting."
"10897470","10898130"," They're expecting this."
"10898510","10901110"," This nasty like rejection down here. "
"10901890","10903570"," We're not quite seeing that yet."
"10904710","10906490"," As a matter of fact, even if you see this."
"10908970","10912510"," You only change the color here to make this smaller. "
"10914290","10917650"," Something else just pay attention to this is a daily candlestick chart."
"10919910","10925730"," You can see where we are currently even here to see this time frame here rollover."
"10925990","10931410"," You can still see the number of days it takes for this even this roller to occur is one, two,"
"10931750","10936990"," three, four, five, six, seven days for that rollover to even get start to get nasty. "
"10938890","10943810"," So nothing in the market right now is saying rollover or extreme rollover."
"10943810","10948370"," We have that death that that murderous rollover in the market."
"10948650","10952050"," And the last time we even had something like that, that still took seven days. "
"10952830","10955710"," So you know, the people are gutting for today tomorrow Friday."
"10956590","10960410"," This could take a week to see any kind of rollover into the end of May."
"10961930","10964930"," You could still see the market pumping in certain areas. "
"10965890","10973410"," Mean what that trade in the market before we see even a meaningful rollover in the market."
"10973410","10977650"," So you can see it in the past two here because there's many, many examples of it."
"10977830","10979050"," You can see it right here. "
"10979070","10984090"," We kind of went up and then we do this nice little rollover right here, but this great, great push"
"10984090","10984570"," up here."
"10985490","10991150"," So to think that the market is going to rollover meaningfully right now, we haven't seen it yet in"
"10991150","10995350"," the IV or in the volatility."
"11000980","11004200"," In the background right now, I'll take a look at the pen to business and see if it can identify"
"11004200","11005480"," any late afternoon stocks. "
"11006460","11028530"," Maybe I want to keep a lookout for me"
"11033490","11034130"," just a minute here."
"11090450","11094430"," So sometimes in today, I'll show you guys, I'm going to show you guys something I'll use intraday."
"11094430","11096770"," So I divide tickers to try to trade. "
"11096910","11098890"," If you guys are looking for day trades and a slow day, do like today."
"11099810","11102850"," So this is another FinViz screener that I use."
"11103030","11103550"," I use different ones. "
"11104110","11105810"," You guys will see me bring up different screeners."
"11107290","11109850"," So today, performance today up."
"11112310","11113690"," Today's civil moving average, right?"
"11113870","11114750"," Price below SMA. "
"11115370","11117970"," Now the average volume is over 1 million, right?"
"11118130","11119370"," So I want to make sure there's liquidity in the stock."
"11120170","11124050"," The key one to this one, though, is the over 1 for relative volume."
"11124450","11127130"," Relative to what it normally has for volume, right?"
"11127850","11130110"," The current volume, you could also use this as well. "
"11132010","11132790"," I'll scroll through."
"11133030","11137550"," I actually change the price to the highest ticker price, and then I run it down some."
"11138190","11139630"," I'm looking at specific tickers today. "
"11139790","11143070"," You can see some of these tickers are inside our list today, right?"
"11143190","11145510"," You see SoFi in there and Tilray came up in there."
"11145950","11147490"," We saw some flow on Tilray."
"11148070","11149830"," So some flow on Rivian as well. "
"11150530","11151810"," And I'll usually just scroll over these."
"11152210","11153490"," You can see this big move by Crowd."
"11153670","11155370"," I think Crowd's already made a big move today. "
"11155950","11157710"," But upstart's another one to take a look at."
"11159170","11163870"," You got Yeti here, Rivian, Affirm, SAVA, MRVI."
"11164410","11166750"," You can take a look at some of these and see if there's a reversal. "
"11167450","11171830"," This Verbiotechnical is interesting to me right here, VIR."
"11173610","11175350"," MDU is interesting to me."
"11176810","11178310"," Here's another one right here, CNME. "
"11178610","11180690"," It looks like there might be an indecision candle here."
"11181370","11182330"," QS, maybe not."
"11183010","11184450"," PSTH, I like this one right now. "
"11185150","11190270"," So in these intradays, like this one right here, HAYW, interesting, right?"
"11190450","11191410"," It's been consolidating."
"11194530","11195610"," Neo, maybe not."
"11197870","11199470"," SoFi is looking interesting right now. "
"11199590","11202130"," You can see Tilray has already kind of played itself out."
"11202130","11204030"," But Santa, I like Santa here."
"11204510","11206170"," I like the idea behind this one right here. "
"11206750","11208550"," Cook is making a reversal right now."
"11209110","11211710"," And you can make your own, you can make your own Finviz for this."
"11212070","11212890"," Intraday kind of stuff. "
"11213450","11219970"," I'm looking for a turn in the market or looking for greater than average volume."
"11220950","11223050"," I know that little volume days you get bigger moves."
"11223810","11225050"," But we're up for the day, Ray. "
"11225190","11226650"," We're not red, spiced, trade, and sideways."
"11227590","11230230"," So you guys can make one of these charts for yourself on Finviz."
"11230930","11234550"," And you can start to investigate some of these trades in here. "
"11235410","11236830"," And taking a look at a few of them."
"11237810","11241230"," I've been seeing if any of them still have maybe some push left in them for the day."
"11242650","11245270"," I think I'd look at VIR. "
"11249320","11249940"," Excuse me here."
"11250020","11250980"," I'm about to choke on myself."
"11252520","11253620"," MDU looks possible. "
"11257120","11259060"," I like PSTH."
"11260840","11262600"," H-A-Y-W, I like a lot."
"11266440","11267200"," It's so far. "
"11267740","11269260"," You saw calls on so far today."
"11270340","11271640"," And I like this Santa too."
"11273380","11274340"," I mean, cook, believe it or not. "
"11274380","11275480"," I kind of like that one as well."
"11278440","11280120"," So just take a look at those on your own."
"11280740","11285780"," And if you're kind of bored today with nothing to do, there are some tickers you can take a look"
"11285780","11286000"," at. "
"11288640","11290640"," Yeah, and crowd already pumped today."
"11290720","11292140"," Crowd pumped right off the bell."
"11295620","11297820"," Looks like Santa already pumped as well. "
"11298040","11299300"," So you'd have to really take a look at some of these."
"11300700","11302420"," Maybe over some more time."
"11303460","11306300"," But I still like Santa even if I don't like the buy for today. "
"11306580","11307720"," I mean, take a look at Santa here."
"11308860","11315980"," Trading down from $26, right?"
"11316860","11319000"," We can see where the turn came on this."
"11320660","11322540"," At $5 now trading at $8. "
"11323520","11325880"," So you can start to track some of these tickers."
"11326200","11329840"," Create that tracker for yourself."
"11330180","11332600"," If you see another, you can make another buy signal down here. "
"11333100","11334360"," Set an alert down here."
"11334620","11335880"," You know, you create an alert for all these tickers."
"11336020","11336600"," They just went over. "
"11339360","11344700"," And if you start getting alerts on your email or your phone down here, it'll tell you when you get"
"11344700","11347460"," a quick little bounce down here if you want to buy some more of this."
"11348060","11349500"," So I was just looking at Santa."
"11349940","11351660"," Let me get some of the other ones I was looking at. "
"11352500","11354420"," The ones that I was interested in."
"11354740","11356420"," Upstart, UPST, right?"
"11358980","11360300"," Was another one that I was looking at."
"11364780","11365620"," Let's go over here. "
"11368560","11370660"," I like this consolidation down here."
"11370860","11371820"," You should too, right?"
"11372120","11372340"," $75."
"11372940","11374000"," Excuse me, $75. "
"11375060","11378520"," You can see there's been some push here, right?"
"11378680","11380420"," There's some consolidation in here."
"11381400","11384240"," I guess some of you could say that this is a bearish, right?"
"11384320","11385100"," A bear flag here."
"11389220","11389940"," Let's see here. "
"11391720","11395520"," But there might be some consolidation, but the volume's been high on this trade."
"11395980","11398480"," Sometimes you look at this and it's going to have a capitulation move."
"11399120","11401880"," So maybe I feel like, well, that's a bear flag cap. "
"11402060","11402740"," I don't know what to do here."
"11403820","11405620"," We'll see if it trades back down here."
"11405680","11407360"," If it comes back down here, you can grab a dip. "
"11407900","11413680"," You can set another alert down here at $75 or buy any of these dips down below."
"11414140","11416920"," You can see they're trying to wear out sellers above over here."
"11419870","11421130"," Let's see above on this one. "
"11422510","11427390"," They're trying to wear out these sellers to try to come back up to this 200 once more."
"11428090","11431470"," But the upstart, maybe not the best one, but I'll keep an eye on that one."
"11432030","11433130"," Let's look at some others here. "
"11433310","11434030"," A firm made a turn."
"11434870","11436390"," I think I said I liked the SAVA."
"11436770","11438050"," So we'll take a look at the SAVA next. "
"11442430","11443490"," Same kind of a thing."
"11445250","11447090"," Getting some weirdness in this chart today."
"11453110","11454270"," Some consolidation here. "
"11454690","11455130"," Failure, right?"
"11455590","11457050"," Consolidation, failure, consolidation."
"11457690","11459510"," Look, might look for some more failure in this one too."
"11460790","11463850"," We'll take a look at this in a longer time period, $31. "
"11464570","11465730"," Kind of like this chart."
"11466170","11467690"," Kind of like this chart a lot, actually."
"11467830","11471090"," I said I didn't like this chart, but I do, because I like that it keeps getting bought down below"
"11471090","11471410"," here. "
"11473210","11477810"," We've got one move here, one move here, another move here, another move here, another move here."
"11478130","11479270"," Traded below to $32."
"11479970","11482990"," Probably going to be looking for at least another move higher here. "
"11483630","11485030"," So I kind of like this trade too."
"11485510","11486210"," I like this trade."
"11486370","11488910"," It's at $41.80. You can take this trade to $50. "
"11490290","11492330"," It's worked many times."
"11492350","11494590"," It's worked once, twice, three, four."
"11495130","11496730"," Now this will be your number five. "
"11497870","11499910"," It's got a lot of volume on it today."
"11500270","11503070"," So it looks like they bought this and they're looking for another push higher here."
"11503610","11506390"," It looks like you're not going to get caught around the $50 mark. "
"11507570","11508570"," So we'll look at SAVA."
"11508930","11510830"," Let's see, look at that on..."
"11512150","11515010"," We'll look at SAVA on..."
"11515010","11517570"," I don't know if they've got some papers due out."
"11517570","11521090"," That's one thing about some of these biotech or any of these medical stuff. "
"11521290","11522930"," You have to make sure that you're watching the news."
"11531030","11540830"," More sellers than buyers right now in SAVA are more sellers than buyers, excuse me."
"11547110","11552190"," The market line at $33.00 and $40.00 to buy. "
"11552950","11556370"," If they might, maybe they have some news coming out and that's kind of your price target up here."
"11556770","11560050"," You can break through this $43.00. You've almost got clear skies."
"11560610","11566610"," A little bit of problems here at $45.00. But I like SAVA here. "
"11569830","11571630"," Anyways, let's take a look at that stock screener."
"11572170","11572990"," This one right here."
"11573390","11574270"," I'll show it to you one more time. "
"11575010","11578690"," Say it's up below price, below 200-day SMA."
"11579090","11580090"," Average volume is over 1 million."
"11580390","11581390"," Lots of interest in that stock. "
"11582270","11584670"," Relative volume for today is over 1."
"11585210","11586410"," We can even do current volume."
"11587530","11588410"," You can do over 1 million."
"11589230","11590270"," Maybe that'll cut it down. "
"11591490","11592850"," Now you've just got one list here."
"11593570","11594590"," You got Santa's here, right?"
"11594690","11595710"," We talked about Santa already."
"11597010","11599870"," Cook and start looking for turns on these tickers. "
"11600890","11601430"," ATIP."
"11602150","11604630"," I like this right here."
"11605670","11606730"," Push down and the push up. "
"11607490","11609830"," I'm always looking for these failures down here for a rip higher."
"11610790","11614990"," That's down to $1.99. I like that trade too."
"11615450","11615950"," I like that failure. "
"11618070","11620330"," I always like failures and tickers."
"11620330","11621090"," I always like stuff. "
