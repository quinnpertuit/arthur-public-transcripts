"400","6500"," We've completed almost a $28 billion deal, all cash, to acquire the data services company Splunk."
"6600","10840"," Joining us now first on CNBC is Chuck Robbins, he's the chairman and CEO of Cisco, and Gary Steele."
"11340","15540"," The CEO of Splunk was here when you guys announced the deal, now Gary's going to be a part of"
"15540","17180"," Cisco's executive leadership team. "
"17780","18860"," Gentlemen, nice to have you."
"19020","20340"," It's great to be here, thanks for having us."
"20680","25640"," You know, all right, it's part of the company now, so you have some other products out there and"
"25640","28780"," security offerings, for example, I think, AppDynamics, Thousand Eyes. "
"29400","32660"," How do you sort of address potential overlaps, redundancies?"
"33500","38520"," How do you go to market now with your product portfolio, given the ones you previously had, and"
"38520","39420"," what you now have?"
"39940","42040"," Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for having us."
"42720","48640"," We're in a situation where we have very little, we have zero overlap in security, with basically"
"48640","48980"," zero."
"49460","55320"," We have slide overlap in what's called observability, which is basically monitoring the"
"55320","58660"," infrastructure for application performance and those kinds of things, and we've been working really"
"58660","64480"," hard over the last six months to actually address those and build an integration plan. "
"64640","65920"," Gary, you may want to talk a little bit about it."
"65960","70640"," We're actually going to move the Cisco assets into Splunk in that particular part of the business."
"70880","72500"," Yeah, I know I'm super excited about this. "
"72700","78860"," I think the combination of AppD plus Splunk's observability cloud gets us the best multi-cloud"
"78860","79960"," hybrid solution industry."
"80320","85560"," So while there's some really good work that's going to happen, we think we can do a lot for our"
"85560","85840"," customers."
"86120","86800"," What does that mean?"
"86900","88220"," Some really good work that's going to happen. "
"89480","95600"," Simply bringing the AppD capabilities into Splunk, so driving that integration and bringing the"
"95600","100140"," capabilities of AppD with the observability cloud."
"100540","105460"," So customers can monitor their digital footprint and really understand their uptime and ensure that"
"105460","106180"," they don't have outages."
"106780","110340"," Chuck, I want to get Jim in, but just, you know, the bigger picture here in terms of what it"
"110340","115980"," means for the future of cybersecurity observability and how Splunk fits into the vision overall for"
"115980","116220"," Cisco. "
"116740","122680"," Well, if you look at the combination of their data platform with our security portfolio and"
"122680","128100"," particularly with our extended detection and response capabilities, you think about taking the data"
"128100","130580"," platform that they have for the customer."
"131360","135620"," You apply high-end AI-based detection and response."
"136320","141900"," What we believe we'll be able to do is give our customers the ability to identify threats and"
"141900","147940"," dynamically react to those threats in real time because as the bad actors become better at"
"147940","155080"," utilizing AI to launch attacks, we think the real-time correlation of disparate events that"
"155080","159740"," together might indicate a security problem is a critical capability that our customers are going to"
"159740","165300"," need and between our technologies, their data platform, we believe we can actually deliver that to"
"165300","165680"," our customers. "
"165900","166720"," An hour and there."
"166940","167920"," You're the same now, you know."
"167960","168380"," That is true. "
"168560","168660"," Yeah."
"168980","169640"," Hour and hour."
"169840","170120"," Yeah. "
"170300","170800"," Hour and hour."
"171140","172780"," Jim, it just happened in the last hour."
"173000","173340"," It did. "
"173620","173640"," Yeah."
"173820","175600"," The big wire transfer has been completed."
"175980","177760"," Jim, I know you've got a question. "
"178120","178520"," Sure."
"178580","179760"," First congratulations, gentlemen."
"181220","183080"," Successful at putting this together. "
"183240","183880"," I think it's really important."
"184080","185040"," Gary, I'm going to go to you first."
"185760","194800"," What is percentage of recurring revenue to you have and now you're going to be part of the San"
"194800","199980"," Francisco and what will it mean for the compound annual growth rate of the combined companies?"
"201060","206400"," So Splunk brings basically $4.2 billion of annual recurring revenue to Cisco. "
"207360","215380"," We just wrapped up a very good year where ARR was growing 15% and while we generated over a"
"215380","221540"," billion dollars of cash flow on that ARR and I'll let Chuck speak to how that comes together in"
"221540","224140"," terms of the overall ARR for the combined companies."
"224800","225400"," Hey, Jim."
"225600","227940"," It's good to see you and I hope you enjoy being on the west coast. "
"227940","229200"," I'm sure you're going to have fun this week."
"230000","230280"," Thank you."
"230520","234500"," When you look at the combined ARR, I think we're approaching $29 billion now. "
"234660","237460"," So it's a meaningful amount of our business."
"237460","240080"," It's been a journey we've been on since I became CEO."
"240840","244880"," We actually, as you know, achieved 50% of our revenue last quarter. "
"245100","247980"," Came from recurring revenue, which has been another thing that we've been trying to achieve."
"247980","253960"," And if you just do the math on adding, I mean, obviously in the first four quarters, Splunk's going"
"253960","260880"," to be a significant growth driver from a financial perspective and then even beyond that, growing"
"260880","268080"," the $4 plus billion going in the mid-teens on our business, layers of point of growth on just by"
"268080","270080"," that alone, even in the outbound years."
"270860","275000"," And that's without any of the revenue synergies, which were really the things that drove this deal"
"275000","275640"," in the first place. "
"276500","276900"," Okay."
"277060","281640"," So Chuck, in the last time I spoke with you on money, you did talk about activation issues."
"281740","286200"," You talked about the idea that you could be limited this quarter just because there was kind of a"
"286200","289360"," backup in the system from your customers. "
"289820","294460"," Can we make it so that that's not the focal point of the discussion now if this deals close?"
"295440","299400"," Jim, I think we talked a lot about the fact that on the tail end of the supply chain problem,"
"300340","304720"," the customers now are sitting on the inventory that we've delivered and they're trying to get all"
"304720","305180"," that installed."
"305520","308900"," And so they've kind of slowed down their ordering patterns until they get that digested."
"309420","317160"," But I think the reality is that the transition that we've made to ARR and software and the"
"317160","320940"," recurring revenue is not fully appreciated because of that right now. "
"321080","323220"," And I think once we get through that, it will be fully appreciated."
"323600","329980"," We're looking at a company now that has over $20 billion in software revenue, over 50% of our"
"329980","333900"," revenue now is coming from recurring offers and almost $29 billion of ARR."
"333900","338440"," So we think over time it's going to be very positive and we're looking forward to the future. "
"338940","339420"," Okay."
"339560","344700"," You have the luxury now with Splunk of the gender of AI that they have, which is immersive chat"
"344700","345120"," experience."
"345480","346080"," That's now you. "
"346800","348000"," That's one part of the puzzle."
"349060","353700"," I know that Jensen Wong, obviously GTC this week, has his own networking capacity."
"353700","356000"," But somehow you're part of it too. "
"356360","361820"," And could you explain how you, which I regard as having a competitor product, are also you know,"
"362040","362640"," NVIDIA's part?"
"363960","370680"," Well, Jensen approached us as I've talked about it and he basically understands the relationships"
"370680","376160"," that we have with our enterprise customers and our understanding of how they deploy applications"
"376160","377620"," and how they build their infrastructure."
"378420","384420"," And so he felt like we were the right partner for him to actually take his GPUs, create integrated"
"384420","390920"," stacks to help facilitate the simple deployment of advanced AI workloads for our customers."
"390920","393980"," And that's what you're going to see from us over the next three to six months. "
"394000","399060"," But if you look at the Splunk acquisition also, we think that same infrastructure now can power"
"399620","403500"," some of these data platforms that Splunk built over the years."
"404140","410780"," And as we, as you know, the more data you have, the more powerful your AI capabilities are going to"
"410780","410960"," be."
"411100","415920"," And so we think between their data platform and our technologies, we can bring the ability for"
"415920","422340"," customers to the enterprise customer to actually deploy and gain benefit from AI workloads in a"
"422340","423020"," very unique way. "
"423840","429480"," Gary Chuck referred to threats, obviously, as a result of AI in particular with great advancements."
"429760","433040"," I mean, how quickly are things moving in the threat environment?"
"433240","434780"," I'm just curious to get your perspective."
"435220","437540"," Yeah, I think we're in a pretty difficult time right now. "
"437660","442500"," I think the threat actors continue to use advanced technology to design more sophisticated threats,"
"442820","446340"," whether they're phishing related threats or other kinds of sophisticated attacks."
"447140","449520"," The good thing is we're the defenders."
"450000","455260"," All of us are leveraging AI in a very constructive way to better defend the enterprise today. "
"455880","461780"," And so while the stakes get higher, I think we're doing a great job of continuing to defend."
"462120","466540"," And finally, Chuck, let me just send sort of, again, back to sort of Cisco overall."
"467240","472120"," I was only on Feb 14 when you were talking about coming out of the quarter of guidance. "
"472620","473260"," You were cautious."
"473920","478960"," Our customers this quarter, you said, saw more caution than the prior quarter, which led your teams"
"478960","480820"," to express more caution in the forecast."
"481540","482980"," Is that still the case a month later?"
"483280","486280"," Well, we're in the middle of the quarter, but I'd say that the dynamics haven't changed"
"486280","486880"," meaningfully. "
"487060","488860"," I think the good news is the economy."
"489120","490440"," I talked about this a couple of weeks ago."
"490720","493060"," I think the economy is good. "
"493600","494140"," It's not great."
"494240","494600"," It's not bad."
"494880","495400"," I think it's good. "
"495400","500440"," And I think that's what's going to be reflected in our customers ordering over the next several"
"500440","501700"," quarters as we look forward."
"501960","502100"," Right."
"502380","502960"," So unchanged. "
"503400","503620"," Unchanged."
"504420","504680"," I'd say."
"504840","505660"," Guys, thank you both. "
"505920","505960"," Chuck Ron."
"506040","506800"," It's Gary Steele."
"507260","508200"," Both of Cisco. "
"508580","509380"," We are both the Cisco."
"509460","510060"," Yes, we are."
"510340","511740"," And very happy to be part of Cisco. "
"512039","512340"," All right."
"512580","512940"," There you go."
"513559","517140"," Coming up, it's a West Coast edition of Jim's Mad Dash. "
"517360","520659"," We'll count it down on an opening bell as well, which is about six and a half minutes from now."
"520760","521200"," Stay with us."
"521200","523460"," Let's see. "
"693550","699970"," Our first cross-country mad dash of the week, you want to talk a little hurts is what I've been"
"699970","700210"," told."
"701290","702870"," Steve's sure it was very successful."
"703190","705010"," Obviously, you see a photo of Goldman Sachs for a long time. "
"705190","705570"," I couldn't be known."
"705750","706410"," I'm going to speak against here."
"706830","708070"," Then went to Hertz a couple of years ago. "
"708410","713030"," I had a vision that maybe what he could be doing is trading cars because like you traded stocks."
"714530","715810"," Like you traded bonds."
"716290","716790"," It didn't work. "
"717090","721550"," The strategy to be able to make it so you take down him, by the way, he had been the"
"721550","723350"," company had put in big orders for EV."
"723850","729610"," The EVs, maybe he was the first passenger, you tell me, EVs appreciated rapidly, which therefore"
"729610","734230"," made it so that his fleet of Teslas was worth less than he thought."
"734530","736230"," Maybe he thought they gave a go-up in value. "
"736510","738190"," Anyway, so he's leaving."
"738190","743210"," Your West is coming in, former COO of Delta, terrific guy."
"743670","746270"," But it is David, frankly, a defeat. "
"747570","753250"," It was initially very exciting, but the idea that you could somehow make it so you can trade cars"
"753250","758390"," like you can trade stocks and bonds, did not work, and it was not fun for Steven."
"758590","759170"," That did matter."
"759450","760630"," He was hoping to have a great time. "
"761030","763930"," His skill set was not correct in the end."
"763930","766530"," And saw us slowing in EVs, moving on."
"766890","771250"," David, it's a shame because I thought Steve was going to do unbelievably well with this strategy. "
"771550","775930"," I too did not see the decline in value of the Teslas that hurt his company so much."
"776350","776550"," Yeah."
"776830","777750"," Well, you've talked about it. "
"777750","778750"," We have as well, of course."
"778910","786150"," That was a faithful decision to go big in that area and to your point, when the values decline in"
"786150","789030"," the used car market, that had negative consequences."
"789830","794490"," They've had so many different people run this company over the last 10 years, Jim. "
"795230","795750"," Yeah."
"796450","798450"," It's just not work for anybody."
"798990","800470"," Never did go bankrupt, but it stayed. "
"801070","802470"," The stock continued to trade."
"803410","805330"," David, I think it's just a very tough business."
"805830","809810"," And because remember, travel, we've seen cruise ships do very well. "
"810010","811430"," American Express obviously do very well."
"811810","813170"," Hotel change for doing very well."
"813590","816850"," There's an Expedia.okay, Bookings does really well. "
"816850","822530"," Now, this did not take part in the great travel resurgence after COVID."
"822810","827190"," And I think that maybe if you had just focused on that and I've got them trading on cars, it"
"827190","828010"," might have been fun."
"828130","829230"," But that's not what he went there for. "
"829450","831170"," He didn't go there to run a travel company."
"831530","832750"," He went there to do fleet management."
"833190","838170"," That had been a great idea until the fleet depreciated, and then there was just not much of a"
"838170","841030"," strategy for him to, let's say, take advantage of it. "
"841390","844510"," Yeah, the fleet was not managed the way that he'd hoped."
"845030","845370"," No."
"845370","845430"," Yeah. "
"845590","847410"," It didn't quite work out."
"847410","847590"," All right."
"847630","851650"," We got a minute until we get started with trading and the sound picks up, and I can barely hear"
"851650","853090"," you, I'm sure, when that happens. "
"853710","857910"," So tell me what you think the key to this market is this morning before we get started with the"
"857910","858330"," week's trading."
"858710","862070"," I'm actually going to go with the alphabet, because I think it was stunning."
"862430","864070"," If it's true, the Bloomberg story is true. "
"864550","870790"," It makes it so that Apple, which many people thought would fall behind in the race to the next 3"
"870790","871710"," trillion, right?"
"871710","876370"," Because it fell down from Microsoft's 3 trillion, a lot of people felt that maybe Nvidia could pass"
"876370","876570"," it."
"876750","882050"," I think that this says, wait a second, this could be the break-up that Apple needs, and suddenly,"
"882050","886170"," Apple, that is far more round than can be caught with Gemini, which a lot of people felt was in"
"886170","889390"," puffs, clearly not a puffs, maybe a resurgence for both."
"890290","890590"," All right. "
"890710","892150"," We got to talk about that sort of stuff."
"892610","892850"," Oh."
"901200","901320"," Yeah. "
"902860","903520"," What a start."
"912740","918640"," We're going to be talking to the company's CEO, that will be in the next hour at the next hour."
"919720","925080"," You've got to ask Trey, I mean, when some short solo went after him, he burned the guy alive. "
"925880","932100"," Man, the guy is just under like a lot of really bad cuz Max, I'm not kidding, he fired the"
"932100","932600"," guy alive."
"932600","933040"," All right."
"933200","936140"," And that's because he's a great executive, the stock is tenfold. "
"936140","937000"," I'll tell you tenfold."
"937360","938780"," We'll make sure we're talking about it."
"938860","939540"," I'm so serious. "
"939660","940500"," I'm going to have a lot of questions."
"940940","949420"," Over to NASDAQ, that's Greek based ship owning company C3IS, that's what I'm going with, that's"
"949420","949820"," what it says."
"950480","950680"," Who knows?"
"950680","950820"," Who knows?"
"952040","953000"," We have no idea. "
"953540","953860"," We have no idea."
"954080","954820"," So where do you want to start?"
"955040","956060"," Now that we got things open, Jim?"
"956980","960260"," Well, you know what, David, can I just mention this Reddit deal that's coming?"
"960260","961160"," Mm-hmm."
"961580","965420"," Because we don't know who it's going to be placed with, it should come tomorrow. "
"966080","970480"," It's very exciting, just a whole new cohort of people might come into the stock market, but they"
"970480","975300"," are rebels, they're renegades, and they don't like the, a lot of them don't like the big"
"975300","979820"," modernization advertising push that Reddit has made."
"980060","980600"," But you know what, David?"
"981020","984700"," I find that if you're going to be a public company, you have to try to make money."
"984960","986820"," It's just something I've discovered in 40 years. "
"987020","987460"," It's important."
"987460","991000"," You don't see a lot of charities coming public, I don't know if you know that."
"991580","996500"," But Reddit is a company that it's in a crossroads where they've got to make more money at the same"
"996500","1001840"," time they've got to keep the Redditors, and that means they have to keep the people who were, let's"
"1001840","1002560"," say, Gamestoppers. "
"1003440","1008960"," Let's hope that that group turns out and owns the stock and doesn't trade it, and then you'll have"
"1008960","1009840"," a very successful deal."
"1011820","1014620"," But it's not an unimportant IPO though."
"1015500","1019840"," I think it's very important because frankly, we keep thinking that we were going to have a good IPO"
"1019840","1022600"," market when a broken stock came, and we don't. "
"1022900","1026260"," I mean, a broken stock just turned out to be like a, like Mattel, you know, it's like Barbie."
"1027440","1027800"," Jeez."
"1028280","1029579"," Well, remember we all got excited. "
"1029880","1033760"," Yeah, Birkenstock and Kava, which actually hung in there, did pretty fairly well."
"1033960","1038619"," David, may I comment that my wife, Lisa, we did have a big container by the website Wendy's."
"1038780","1040020"," My wife has a pair of Birkenstocks. "
"1040020","1045200"," I think they're 30 times the price of my crocs, but they look exactly the same."
"1046380","1046740"," Okay."
"1046940","1049060"," So you're not a buyer of Birkenstocks, I guess is what I'm trying to do. "
"1049060","1054140"," No, no, and I'm not really a buyer of crocs, but I think the fact is, is my crocs hold"
"1054140","1057220"," up there in the Birkenstock or cool in Birkenstock, but you know what?"
"1057620","1059100"," There's no accounting for taste, David."
"1060060","1060980"," That is the case."
"1061240","1062040"," That is often the case. "
"1062240","1066200"," But Reddit will be an important test, at least, I mean, again, to your point, we have not seen what"
"1066200","1071980"," we thought in terms of the IPOs, that especially given how many companies have been out there"
"1071980","1076920"," waiting for the window to open, how much more open could it be than this period No, no, no."
"1077460","1081580"," I mean, people should be jumping out of the door and thinking, David, just in AI alone, the"
"1081580","1085920"," companies that are going to be speaking at the conference, in video conference, there's got to be"
"1085920","1087180"," 50 that want to come public."
"1087660","1091920"," I mean, unless, did it change, David, do people feel like if you're public, it's, I don't know,"
"1092000","1092640"," it's not fun?"
"1093160","1095580"," I mean, come on, don't people want to make money anymore?"
"1096340","1097000"," What happened to that?"
"1098800","1103120"," I know, I don't, listen, I don't know, given the momentum in the market, given where we came from"
"1103120","1107080"," last year, where the window seemed to be slightly opening at least, and we did get a number of"
"1107080","1112840"," them, are obviously being the most important, perhaps, and certainly a great performer. "
"1113120","1117660"," We've talked about the fact that there are not many shares out, but nonetheless, a great performer"
"1117660","1121880"," one would have thought we would have seen more, and again, to your point, maybe it's a little early"
"1121880","1128300"," in the gestation for some of these companies that are specific to large language models, generative"
"1128300","1132880"," AI, things of that nature, but there are plenty of other SaaS companies out there, Jim, that have"
"1132880","1133220"," been waiting."
"1134120","1138000"," Right, and that's why Burger and Sock are, and we've got to get something going, and I'm hoping"
"1138000","1140020"," that Reddit gets people excited again."
"1140900","1143740"," Right now, it's just once again, people want that 5%. "
"1144220","1148420"," We didn't mention the Fed yet, okay, the Fed, no, let's go back to Nvidia per second."
"1150280","1156140"," Nvidia's done a lot of part, but you heard Chuck Robbins, I mean, everyone wants the halo of Jensen"
"1156140","1156480"," Walk."
"1156760","1161260"," Everyone wants to be associated with it, in part because it's been such a great performer. "
"1161700","1163720"," However, there are already naysayers, David."
"1163860","1167380"," I am hearing people, including people in our network, who are saying, this marks the peak."
"1167800","1173280"," We've got the Fed talking top, we're going to be finishing GTC, we're done with AI, I don't know"
"1173280","1178940"," how can you say it marks the peak if you're talking about a multi-year transition from CPU to GPU,"
"1179400","1182680"," but I know short-termers are saying that this is the peak this week. "
"1183100","1183820"," I'm hearing it."
"1183920","1184820"," I'm hearing from a lot of people."
"1185020","1192040"," There are, but there are also plenty who say that we are just at the very, very beginning, and the"
"1192040","1197180"," amount of compute power that we're going to need is staggering, and I've talked often, frankly,"
"1197380","1202960"," about one of the gating issues, not even being the chips themselves, but the power that is going to"
"1202960","1209280"," be needed to actually have these data centers operating at folks capacity, which is not there. "
"1210100","1215480"," We have the greater bit more button, there haven't been more electricity used for many decades."
"1216060","1220240"," Suddenly, we're having a 5% increase over last year because of data centers."
"1220680","1222340"," Next year, pork has to be 5%. "
"1222340","1223340"," We're going to need solar."
"1223860","1225160"," We're going to be needing wind."
"1226220","1230380"," Nuke, I think you and I both know, is terrific, but it's not going to happen, but we're going to"
"1230380","1235200"," need so much generation that the natural gas business, which right now, natural gas is very cheap,"
"1235520","1240160"," is going to go into high gear, which is why I keep saying this for Nova is very interesting, this"
"1240160","1241960"," GE spinoff that we have in April. "
"1242440","1247160"," I think for Nova could be interesting, and I thought it would be a loser, but the need for power,"
"1247340","1252260"," as you correctly point out, is just humongous, and I know that Jensen's going to be talking about"
"1252260","1257220"," how much heat these generate, they obviously generate less heat than you think, but wow, David,"
"1257460","1262420"," this data center move is making it so our electric grid is being taxed severely, and no one's"
"1262420","1263340"," talking about it, some for you."
"1263340","1269200"," Yeah, you know, I had some interesting conversations, as I think I've said, with those who are in"
"1269200","1275100"," the data center business, and that's what struck me was that that's the key issue, and again, it"
"1275100","1278780"," doesn't, we're going to be having blackouts or anything of that nature, it simply means that if you"
"1278780","1282940"," want to put shovels in the ground for the next data center, you've got to make sure you have a"
"1282940","1287520"," secure supply of power, and that may really begin to be an issue."
"1287740","1292220"," We've discussed that we will continue to get into a prologue, but they have $500 million in data"
"1292220","1292460"," center. "
"1292460","1298500"," A lot of these utilities, and what not, went up, the stock prices went up a lot as though it"
"1298500","1304040"," says years to come in terms of being able to build the capacity that's needed, I mean, was that a"
"1304040","1305580"," justified move in many of those days?"
"1306160","1309980"," No, no, not a justified move, because these companies have to find a lot of way, they have to"
"1309980","1315680"," finance, and obviously rates went up, the stocks are not great buys, I think semper is, the"
"1315680","1321940"," semper's got a lot of very good natural gas, but you know, David, the country isn't ready for it."
"1321940","1325700"," I mean, eating had a meeting last week is owned by my travel trust, they're one of these companies"
"1325700","1330680"," that is done with trying to get the electrification grid going, the federal government obviously"
"1330680","1335960"," spending a lot of money on this too, but we're not ready, we're not ready for the demand, and it"
"1335960","1339260"," is going to be something to see where they put all the data centers because they got to go with"
"1339260","1344260"," the power's cheapest, and right now there's a hunt, one of the reasons why I want to talk to"
"1344260","1349640"," prologue is they have 12,000 acres ready to put new data centers on, it may be the most important"
"1349640","1353560"," thing, look at that, it's not something called worse, that's all data center, you're looking at a"
"1353560","1359480"," data center play, yeah, Virted by the way is the one that you and I know gave Cody, the chairman"
"1359480","1364420"," of Virted is the pure play in terms of what's in the data center, and wow, and then don't forget"
"1364420","1369680"," Super Micro, out of the S&P, I mean, there's a good chart, Super Micro has got a chart, look"
"1369680","1374820"," at that, it all comes back to of course NVIDIA in some ways, Dell is another name, right, I mean,"
"1375020","1379060"," I mean, here are different things about just how profitable they are, servers that go into the data"
"1379060","1384560"," center that have the NVIDIA chips are, but it helps, boy, I mean, look at the move that that stock"
"1384560","1390820"," had after earnings because they have access to the key here, which of course is those H100s."
"1391200","1393800"," Well, David, do you hear bubble, do you hear people talk bubble?"
"1394780","1402300"," Well, yeah, you hear it, you hear it, Jim, but I don't know that the comparisons are appropriate to"
"1402300","1408140"," buy a bubble that you and I both lived through, I reported through it, you invested through it in"
"1408140","1410440"," the late 90s, so this is very different. "
"1410980","1415540"," Well, I mean, Michael Dell, as you know, an incredibly serious business person is making a fortune"
"1415540","1424120"," doing the, a little bit attenuated part of AI, and NVIDIA is able to charge what it can do because"
"1424120","1429420"," it's basically monopoly, but it works, the total cost of ownership is not that bad, it's kind of"
"1429420","1433860"," like a, you got to think about like a car, it forms very well after buy it, but when you"
"1433860","1435440"," buy it initially, it's expensive."
"1436220","1440180"," I just think, David, these companies are making fortunes, and that's why they're stock, well AMD is"
"1440180","1445180"," making fortunes, that's why AMD's chart, there was no NVIDIA you'd say, AMD's greatest stock in"
"1445180","1450480"," history, but we had just many, many companies that are making fortunes in this business and are,"
"1450680","1455160"," I'm going to use the word that, I'm just going to use them, indispensable, these companies are"
"1455160","1455460"," indispensable."
"1457080","1463340"," Yeah, even though AMD is no match for NVIDIA when it comes to actually powering, it's accelerated"
"1463340","1464060"," computing essentially. "
"1464620","1470100"," Well, AMD doesn't have the data, doesn't have the, what you need to learn from, so therefore it"
"1470100","1474640"," doesn't have the inference where you, you ask it something and it comes back with an answer, it's,"
"1474680","1479140"," but it is a chip that's incredibly fast, and so I don't want to say, at least it's who doesn't"
"1479140","1483500"," have something in the game, it's just that you need all the data already in before you can start"
"1483500","1489500"," asking it, and NVIDIA's got just tremendous data, they have, you know, the large learning models"
"1489500","1495500"," that aren't smart, and they know things, and they comb the web and you want to just plug in your"
"1495500","1497140"," questions, you don't want to wait around."
"1498820","1503120"," Jim, I want to come back to really what is the, you know, we've mentioned a number of times, but"
"1503120","1508400"," it's the story powering to the largest market cap companies, and that is this Bloomberg story"
"1508400","1508840"," again."
"1509940","1512080"," Alphabet shares are up almost 7%. "
"1512080","1517980"," Now remember, there's a decent amount of people who are short the stock in part because of the"
"1517980","1525240"," story we've been discussing, which is will they move quickly enough to defend search as it changes"
"1525240","1531300"," from the Google search to what will become the new search, which is you just go to a large language"
"1531300","1537680"," model and use that, whether it's CHACH-EPT or Gemini, which of course is their entrant or co-pilot,"
"1538920","1546220"," or perplexity, which actually allows you to use all of them, perplexity sort of almost like this"
"1546220","1548100"," Google floor or large language models."
"1549040","1553840"," It is possible, isn't it, Jim, you know, again, it's early reporting here from, it would seem to a"
"1553840","1558980"," certain extent from Bloomberg, and I'm just guessing, but it is possible that isn't it that Apple"
"1558980","1560280"," could be using all of them, right?"
"1560480","1564240"," I mean, do you have to sign up an exclusive deal, which is Gemini?"
"1565120","1565500"," That's a great question."
"1565500","1565940"," That's a great question. "
"1566180","1566620"," I don't know."
"1566780","1568980"," They do need to have something quickly."
"1569460","1570440"," I think the Gemini is good. "
"1570620","1573600"," I mean, yes, you can make deals with everybody, but the Gemini is good."
"1573600","1577600"," I just think the problem with Gemini is that what you said, which is it's going to take away from"
"1577600","1582540"," the ad revenue you can search, when I think about Google these days, I was always just hoping that"
"1582540","1586940"," maybe YouTube would take up the vacuum, and Google Cloud would take up the vacuum."
"1587420","1591900"," I think your search has to go down because of all these new different systems, but this makes their"
"1591900","1596120"," search and their AI supreme again. "
"1596720","1597500"," David, this is huge."
"1598020","1602080"," And my challenge just owns it, and we have just been lamenting alphabet for months."
"1603260","1605580"," Well, no lamentation today. "
"1605920","1606300"," Yeah."
"1606480","1607560"," Although again, I would caution."
"1607860","1610120"," Early, nothing says this is going to happen. "
"1610980","1614960"," We've made the point many times when it comes to Apple, they don't have to be first."
"1615360","1619980"," They got 1.2 billion people in their system."
"1620600","1623220"," They oftentimes are not necessarily. "
"1623560","1624400"," They don't like to be first."
"1624400","1629060"," They have a better user experience than anybody else, and that typically wins the day."
"1629060","1629160"," Yeah. "
"1629400","1632540"," At least certainly when you have 1.2 billion installed base, it can win."
"1632540","1632720"," Right."
"1633320","1637020"," With touching 2 billion people, remember you got this great service revenue stream. "
"1637500","1643820"," Tim Cook has always said, look, we are a tech company first with a consumer that loves us and is"
"1643820","1644480"," very satisfied."
"1644980","1649820"," You don't get that satisfaction, which is almost 100% satisfaction, by offering an inferior"
"1649820","1650360"," product."
"1650820","1655080"," But again, I keep going back to that Best Buy conference call where they just shocked me and said,"
"1655200","1659360"," look, the Samsung phone is the hottest phone, and the Samsung phone has a lot of AI. "
"1660880","1661200"," Yeah."
"1661500","1663360"," I know you've mentioned it any number of times."
"1664800","1665860"," Did I bore you with it?"
"1665980","1666480"," I mean, what the hell?"
"1666580","1667240"," I was the only person on the phone. "
"1667240","1667880"," No, I don't have one."
"1668520","1669260"," I haven't used it."
"1669680","1670620"," Well, I was on the disc call. "
"1670720","1671360"," That was a good call."
"1671540","1672540"," You want to talk about that in Powell?"
"1673220","1674440"," That great move under armor?"
"1674640","1677980"," You want to take the hotelier and you can't hurt and bring back the shoe guy?"
"1678360","1679740"," No, I mean, I can talk about a lot of companies."
"1680000","1681080"," What would you like to talk about?"
"1682620","1686980"," You want to talk a little Disney so we can do a point counterpoint on that too?"
"1686980","1689360"," Well, sure. "
"1689940","1694480"," I mean, Jim Stewart with a very big piece in the New York Times, and I think concludes if you"
"1694480","1696480"," get to the end that maybe Nelson would be valuable."
"1697160","1701140"," David, kind of a not that positive article in the Wall Street Journal about Nelson."
"1701240","1702000"," No, I don't have any questions. "
"1702000","1704640"," Completing articles over the weekend, very interesting in the timing."
"1704960","1708500"," As you say, one quite positive I would argue overall in terms of Nelson Pouts."
"1709820","1715400"," And then the journal focusing more on the internal going on at try-in itself. "
"1715400","1720700"," I was surprised the Times did not have any mention of Ed Garden, of course, who helped run that"
"1720700","1721700"," firm for many years."
"1722040","1726520"," Certainly the author of or at least behind many of the white papers."
"1728240","1732800"," No mention at all in the New York Times story, but the journal spent a good amount of time on"
"1732800","1732940"," it. "
"1733640","1739520"," The news this morning, Jim, is that these proxy advisory firms often do play an important role"
"1739520","1739840"," here."
"1740100","1744520"," They advise many of the passive investors, namely the index funds."
"1745140","1747360"," At least on how they should vote their shares. "
"1747740","1750900"," We do have one in so far that I'm aware of, which is Glass Lewis."
"1751440","1752300"," That goes for Disney."
"1753600","1756760"," I've got it here, I think, in terms of their recommendation. "
"1759100","1759880"," And, you know, they will."
"1760080","1761580"," ISS, I haven't seen yet."
"1761820","1763540"," That's still become..."
"1763540","1765260"," both sides have been busy in meetings. "
"1765660","1770960"," As I pointed out last week, of course, Bob Iger making the rounds in Boston and Baltimore and"
"1770960","1777560"," wherever the big institutions are making their case in terms of why Peltz and Rizoula should not be"
"1777560","1777880"," on the board."
"1779020","1785440"," Well, look, I do think that on the one hand you've got a stock that is going down substantially and"
"1785440","1788040"," it's just been miserable of which some of that was Iger."
"1788440","1790320"," On the other hand, you've got a stock that's been red hot. "
"1790780","1792840"," And maybe that's Peltz, maybe that's this competition."
"1793840","1795300"," But Nelson's going to be defeated."
"1795740","1798000"," He'll be defeated by the stock price being up so much. "
"1798000","1801220"," Because people just say, hey, listen, it's fine."
"1801440","1802660"," Maybe they've gotten more focused."
"1803500","1808580"," You know, I come back to it and you say that the white paper that Nelson Peltz put out is"
"1808580","1811720"," really about how the board is dysfunctional, not how the company is dysfunctional. "
"1812640","1816900"," And the board seems to have so many powerful, fantastic people."
"1817140","1819660"," It is a little surprising that they were really bad at succession."
"1820400","1823080"," It is surprising that they were bad at guidance of the CEO. "
"1823860","1827820"," And I think there's this misperception that if you're on the board, it's supposed to be running the"
"1827820","1827980"," company."
"1828260","1829180"," Nelson doesn't run the company."
"1829560","1833560"," He wants the board to be more focused on cost and on what they produce. "
"1834240","1834840"," But you know what I mean?"
"1834980","1835500"," Look at that board."
"1835660","1839340"," It's like, how could they have so many great people and not be more thoughtful?"
"1841000","1843440"," Well, there's arguments to be made."
"1843700","1847880"," Obviously, they are in the midst of a seminal transition in the industry, which they're a part"
"1847880","1849320"," we've talked about it many times. "
"1849800","1852660"," You know, it's easy enough to say you could have done this or that."
"1853780","1854980"," That's a good point."
"1856120","1860780"," You know, when you do compare them to some of their competitors who've been similarly involved in"
"1860780","1863180"," that transition, they look better by comparison. "
"1864280","1866240"," Obviously, they have the parks to help fuel it."
"1866480","1867600"," But not these years."
"1867600","1870560"," When it comes to succession, there's no argument to be made there. "
"1872800","1873820"," They screwed it up."
"1874540","1875300"," I know."
"1875420","1881400"," Jimmy Pitaro, the guy who runs ESPN, is a smart guy. "
"1881400","1884780"," David ESPN, they lost so many subscribers."
"1885140","1888200"," I mean, it's a little bit like the Dutch boy with the dine."
"1888600","1890680"," And yet, they're very thoughtful about what they do. "
"1891320","1893000"," Pitaro's a really good piece about it."
"1893100","1894000"," I mean, really smart guy."
"1894480","1894900"," But you know what?"
"1895060","1897480"," The industry is in top industry right now. "
"1897540","1898140"," You're absolutely right."
"1898400","1899480"," And thank heavens for theme parks."
"1900000","1900440"," Thank you. "
"1900560","1904000"," Listen, ESPN still generates $2.8 billion operating profit."
"1904300","1905460"," And they're a very good company."
"1905660","1906760"," Obviously, it's a cable network. "
"1907300","1910680"," And there are far fewer people out there available to watch."
"1911500","1913360"," Those that are watch us, of course."
"1913820","1914320"," Of course. "
"1914920","1916000"," They watch us on Reddit."
"1916320","1916960"," Oh, no, no, Reddit."
"1917380","1918040"," They don't. "
"1918240","1918360"," They don't."
"1918360","1919100"," They're not on Reddit."
"1920560","1922100"," All right, we'll figure out Reddit. "
"1922620","1926180"," While we do that, let's give you a quick look at the bond market this morning."
"1927260","1928600"," We call it the bond report."
"1929180","1932160"," It's when we check out how surgeries are sharing and what the yields are. "
"1932280","1938220"," You can see right now, we are up across the board with that 10-year at 4.316. The two "
"1938220","1941860","-year note yielding 4.73. We're right back."
"2130780","2131300"," See."
"2145670","2151150"," The last team marked $6 billion to 4-speed helicopter, but just in fact, it's really good juncture. "
"2151890","2155710"," Coming up, a rare look inside the maker of Black Hawk."
"2156490","2156550"," Literally."
"2157730","2161650"," We're going to take the skies in the next hour's walk of the street and see it right there. "
"2332150","2334130"," All right, let's get to it."
"2334210","2336310"," Things have finally quieted a bit here, Jim."
"2336710","2338310"," PepsiCo is the name you want to talk about?"
"2338650","2338810"," Yeah. "
"2339050","2342130"," Up almost 3% on an upgrade by a thaw."
"2342310","2346250"," There's more than one Darrow Wall Street, Darrow Mossenian, who's really one of the best analysts"
"2346250","2347970"," who covers this consumer package."
"2348190","2351110"," Good group, Morgan Stanley, and it's a very cogent upgrade. "
"2351610","2353770"," This is a man who said, look, this company's slowing down."
"2353890","2354630"," It's going to miss his targets."
"2355230","2357190"," Guts, you think, because Ray Mullen McGarden doesn't miss targets. "
"2357470","2357770"," He's the CEO."
"2357770","2358790"," Well, he did."
"2359170","2362290"," And now, Derek comes back and says, it's bottoming. "
"2362570","2363390"," It's about to inflect."
"2363590","2364690"," I really like this call."
"2364970","2369730"," The only reservation I have is that he really doesn't address the GLP-1. "
"2370050","2373270"," We haven't talked about Lily at all today or Novo."
"2373550","2377210"," He's saying, you know, he's basically saying, look, this thing is so cheap and it's going to come"
"2377210","2377430"," back."
"2377730","2382630"," I like the call, but I also want to keep one eye always on what people are doing with the"
"2382630","2385490"," CEO's epics and the Majoros and the Zepbounds. "
"2386150","2386590"," Yeah."
"2386850","2387250"," All right."
"2387450","2388410"," What does that tell you of late?"
"2388710","2390730"," Anything new on the old GLP-1 front?"
"2390930","2393870"," I think people talk about Eli Lilly or Novo this morning. "
"2394390","2394710"," No."
"2395030","2398650"," I think that people are just saying, all right, let's see how big the numbers are."
"2399050","2400990"," Now, we're getting this backlash. "
"2401570","2406670"," Small companies that are picking away at some of what these companies might or may not be able to"
"2406670","2406990"," accomplish."
"2407230","2409070"," I say use any week just by Eli Lilly."
"2409350","2412030"," It's a core position to travel trust and I think it goes much harder. "
"2412490","2413010"," You do."
"2414030","2414390"," Yeah."
"2414670","2418890"," Because I think that hypertension and heart attacks, they're being preventable. "
"2419270","2420130"," Well, you didn't even mention."
"2420130","2421550"," You didn't even mention Alzheimer's."
"2422550","2425010"," Well, I was disappointed that Lily didn't get it. "
"2425190","2426230"," It's Alzheimer's review."
"2426630","2427970"," And then it's going to be a full bore of you."
"2428130","2429750"," And I don't think they thought that would happen either. "
"2430050","2430750"," Let's see what's put."
"2431370","2432730"," That's going to be a very big drug."
"2433010","2436290"," But people are very concerned how much it's going to cost the system. "
"2437330","2438790"," But I thought that they are ready."
"2439150","2439910"," And I was disappointed."
"2440270","2441210"," There's no doubt about it. "
"2441210","2442450"," That was just not great."
"2442630","2443190"," Yeah, but it's not."
"2443270","2445010"," It's not as though it was cast aside. "
"2445030","2446270"," It's just going to take longer."
"2446450","2447310"," They're giving it a little more."
"2447410","2447450"," Right. "
"2447450","2447710"," Right."
"2447930","2450950"," It's just that there was a lot of talk that it would be done by this quarter."
"2451210","2454710"," And a lot of people, you know, the work I do at the American Brain Foundation, everybody I talked"
"2454710","2456090"," to thought that this was a gimme. "
"2456850","2458010"," And not Lily's fault."
"2458150","2458950"," Lily was never promotional."
"2459550","2460210"," But let's watch. "
"2460470","2461130"," You're absolutely right."
"2461190","2461630"," It's not going to."
"2461690","2462750"," It's not going to sidetrack it. "
"2462810","2463210"," It's going to happen."
"2463950","2464490"," All right."
"2464630","2466990"," What do you got on the big show tonight from one market?"
"2466990","2468450"," Our headquarters out in San Franam. "
"2468790","2469110"," Okay."
"2471210","2472950"," They're just a gigantic warehouse company."
"2473130","2475930"," But they have been focused very much on data center. "
"2476130","2477510"," Let's find out how much power they use."
"2477930","2481250"," David CrowdStrike is now the knowledge king of cybersecurity."
"2481710","2484550"," We heard what Chuck Robbins was talking about with Gary Steele. "
"2484830","2486430"," These are the guys that are doing the best."
"2486910","2489830"," 30% revenue growth for as far as the eye can see."
"2489910","2490630"," It's a big company now. "
"2490850","2492650"," And on semi, which is a company that's stumbled."
"2492970","2493070"," Why?"
"2493390","2498330"," Because it's really related to auto, but it's got a solar business that I'm interested in because"
"2498330","2502110"," it converts solar energy into regular energy for electricity."
"2502430","2506850"," And again, David, you're I think you're focused on what's going to happen to the grid and 5%"
"2506850","2509290"," increase in the amount of power we need here. "
"2509490","2510930"," We're just not ready for this country."
"2511250","2511650"," Yeah."
"2511870","2514110"," Well, a story we'll continue to discuss. "
"2514550","2516290"," Jim, have a great rest of the day."
"2516510","2516810"," Thank you."
"2517170","2518870"," I'll see you tomorrow morning. "
"2519050","2523390"," But of course, you'll see everybody else on that Monday tonight coming up right here in the next"
"2523390","2523790"," hour."
"2523790","2525250"," We're ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods."
"2525510","2527150"," He's live from Sarah, a week more. "
"2527190","2527750"," Squawk on the streets."
"2710610","2711170"," Have income."
"2720920","2722020"," Good Monday morning. "
"2722240","2723880"," Welcome to another hour of squawk on the street."
"2723920","2724300"," I'm Sarah."
"2724560","2727940"," I do the David favor live as always from post nine of the New York Stock Exchange. "
"2728040","2729280"," Carl has the morning off."
"2729420","2730040"," Take a look at stock."
"2730720","2736020"," Having higher here in the early session and almost a 12% on the SMB 500 for the NASDAQ of"
"2736020","2739220"," 1.3%. The only groups that are underperforming today. "
"2739220","2740720"," Well, actually, everybody's up."
"2740880","2742840"," But utilities and industrials are at the bottom of the pack."
"2743180","2747380"," Communication services and information technology are really leading the charge. "
"2747700","2749040"," Alphabet is part of the story."
"2749260","2751240"," They are up almost more than 6%."
"2751240","2754200"," Right now, some of the media names are rallying as well. "
"2754500","2756200"," Take a look at Treasuries to kick off the week."
"2756260","2757880"," It's been a story of higher yields lately."
"2758340","2761520"," And the market has brushed that off, continues to do so today. "
"2761980","2765060"," The 10-year yield at 4.3% two-year yield ahead of the Fed."
"2765060","2771780"," 4.732%. So, again, selling bonds yield higher."
"2772180","2773660"," 30 minutes into the trading session here. "
"2773740","2774920"," Three big movers were watching."
"2775360","2780420"," Shows with Alphabet rallying on these reports that in talks with Apple to have its Gemini"
"2780420","2783420"," artificial intelligence engine in Apple's iPhones."
"2783920","2785400"," Much more on that big story coming up. "
"2785760","2788020"," Super micro computer shares keep pushing higher."
"2788280","2791100"," The server maker joining the SMB 500 index today."
"2791560","2796740"," The stock has been riding the AI boom, soaring more than 10-fold over the last 12 months. "
"2796980","2798040"," And staying with the AI theme."
"2798380","2802240"," NVIDIA shares moving higher as well as the company kicks off its developers' conference."
"2802760","2805680"," The stock is up now more than 80% this year. "
"2806300","2809140"," Going into CEO Jensen Wong's keynote speech today."
"2809340","2811240"," We're going to head live to the big event later this hour."
"2811460","2812600"," Ooh, can't wait for that. "
"2813260","2814380"," But first, fresh clues."
"2814720","2816400"," This hour about the health of the housing market."
"2816720","2818100"," Diane Oleg has that for us, Diane. "
"2818760","2824260"," David home builder sentiment in March rose three points to 51 on the National Association of Home"
"2824260","2824860"," Builders Index."
"2825420","2826580"," The street was looking for unchanged."
"2827000","2827460"," So that's a B."
"2827700","2829640"," That is the fourth consecutive monthly gain. "
"2829960","2831900"," And the highest level since last July."
"2832180","2837440"," It's also the first time sentiment has been in positive territory since July 50 is the line between"
"2837440","2838320"," positive and negative."
"2838680","2842560"," The Builders report demand is, quote, brisk of the index's three components. "
"2842900","2848080"," Current sales conditions rose four points to 56 expectations of sales in the next six months rose"
"2848080","2852420"," two points to 62 and buyer traffic increased two points to 34."
"2852960","2858020"," Regionally, on a three month moving average, sentiment rose most in the Midwest and in the West."
"2858240","2863840"," Now the report also said more builders are cutting back on lowering home prices in order to attract"
"2863840","2864260"," more buyers. "
"2864800","2870720"," In March, 24% of builders reported cutting home prices down from 36% in December of last year."
"2871160","2873320"," And the lowest share since July of last year."
"2873320","2876620"," But the average price cut remains the same around six percent. "
"2876980","2881120"," They are, however, still using sales incentives like buying down mortgage rates."
"2881340","2881540"," Sarah."
"2882160","2884320"," So is housing picking back up again, Diana?"
"2884560","2885060"," Where do we stand?"
"2885700","2885960"," Yeah. "
"2886080","2889620"," I mean, it appears to be picking back up despite the fact that mortgage rates have really been"
"2889620","2892280"," hovering around seven percent for the last two months."
"2892360","2897500"," And so the builders are obviously benefiting from the fact that the existing home market has so"
"2897500","2898400"," little for sale on it."
"2898460","2902500"," Now we are seeing more inventory come on to the market because it's spring and we usually do. "
"2902840","2903980"," But demand is still there."
"2904080","2908000"," I think people are starting to get used to the seven percent rate if they can afford it."
"2908660","2909140"," Got it. "
"2909300","2909820"," Diana Olick."
"2909900","2910440"," Thank you very much."
"2911040","2914300"," Kicking off what is going to be a very busy week ahead for the markets. "
"2914300","2919180"," A lot of catalysts, the three main ones, the FED, the B.O.J. and NVIDIA, I think are the"
"2919180","2921700"," biggest, biggest impacts of the market."
"2922000","2922680"," Here's the calendar."
"2922840","2923960"," We got your B.O.J. Didn't we?"
"2924460","2925760"," You were telling us about that on Friday. "
"2925780","2926560"," It's going to come tonight."
"2926720","2927140"," Oh, it's tonight."
"2927960","2929000"," Tuesday is the B.O.J. meeting. "
"2929000","2934040"," Yeah, and it's also exciting for me because on Thursday, Nike and Lulu Lemon both report."
"2934340","2937160"," I don't think they've ever reported on the same day, which is just interesting because they're"
"2937160","2939340"," competitors, but it's earnings."
"2940040","2943320"," It's a bank of, let's talk about bank of Japan because this is a really big deal. "
"2943640","2946960"," So Bank of Japan is set to raise interest rates tonight."
"2947100","2950920"," Maybe they'll push it to April, but increasingly economists think it's going to happen tonight."
"2951980","2956540"," And that would be the first time in 17 years and they would take it from negative point one percent"
"2956540","2957720"," to zero percent. "
"2957720","2960540"," The last man standing on negative interest rates."
"2960540","2965180"," Here's the wage jump in Japan and here's part of the reason why they had these negotiations with"
"2965180","2966140"," the largest trade unions."
"2966760","2971360"," It's called the Shunto on Friday, I believe, and you can see what's happened. "
"2971660","2972340"," We just shot it."
"2972400","2973220"," We got a big increase."
"2973900","2979100"," And that's on top of the fact that their core core, what they call when they strip out food and"
"2979100","2981880"," energy has been above two percent for the last year or so. "
"2982360","2987180"," It's on top of the fact, David, that the Nikkei, their Japanese stock market is at a record high."
"2987620","2989300"," The Japanese yen is at a 30-year low."
"2989580","2990700"," Like now is the time. "
"2991340","2996360"," You had very easy financial conditions there and higher inflation to raise interest rates."
"2996900","3002940"," And it will just be interesting because it is a big change, a fundamental change in the bond"
"3002940","3003300"," market."
"3003720","3005900"," A lot of people say it's priced in already. "
"3006180","3008700"," We've seen Treasury sell off in anticipation to this."
"3008940","3012420"," But one of the biggest central banks and one of the biggest buyers of bonds."
"3013320","3015760"," As you pointed out, a very long period of time. "
"3016700","3019600"," Way before it became fashionable, they were negative."
"3019700","3020180"," They were negative."
"3020540","3022360"," They were buying ETFs. "
"3022460","3022960"," They were buying everything."
"3023300","3027540"," They were ballooning their balance sheet before it became a great experiment."
"3027820","3030580"," Trying to generate some inflation that they finally have. "
"3030780","3031660"," They finally have it."
"3031860","3036000"," And so I think, you know, they've got a dovish central bank governor in Weida."
"3036320","3037860"," And I don't think they're going to be in any rush. "
"3038440","3040360"," And they're going to be easier than the Fed and the ECB."
"3040360","3043640"," And most other central banks still when they raise interest rates."
"3043640","3044700"," But that's one dynamic. "
"3045100","3045220"," Okay."
"3045440","3046020"," The others the Fed."
"3046760","3050960"," And the views are changing a little bit on what to expect. "
"3051440","3055820"," Will Fed Chair Powell sound a little more hawkish than he did the last time we heard from him"
"3055820","3061560"," publicly, which was the Humphrey Hawkins testimony in Congress because it was before the CPI and"
"3061560","3064420"," the PPI reports for February showed some firmness there."
"3064900","3066220"," Stick your inflation prices."
"3066640","3068720"," I don't remember any headlines coming out of either data. "
"3068720","3069260"," Nothing."
"3069420","3071980"," Nothing because he didn't change the script."
"3072360","3074180"," He basically just said we're in we're patient. "
"3074340","3078220"," We're in data watching mode and we like the inflation progress."
"3078560","3083480"," But will he sound a little bit more like, okay, we have to, you know, we've seen a few readings"
"3083480","3088860"," that make us wonder how quickly we can cut interest rates, for example."
"3089160","3090100"," So the odds are changing. "
"3090460","3093100"," JP Morgan went from just over the weekend."
"3093100","3097420"," They were expecting as much as 125 basis points in cuts this year."
"3097420","3101740"," So they've caught up to where the Fed predicted it would be in September. "
"3101760","3107020"," And then that's going to be the big question on the dot plot, which gives you the projections of"
"3107020","3110960"," where each Fed official sees rates going this year."
"3111180","3113680"," The median estimate was three cuts in September."
"3114160","3115620"," They're going to update that forecast. "
"3116320","3121160"," Will they take it to two cuts and signal to the market, which is totally caught up with the Fed,"
"3121540","3123640"," that we're going to take it even slower."
"3123640","3125620"," And will the market care about it?"
"3125760","3128200"," You know, looking at the odds this morning, Fed Fund's future."
"3128320","3132980"," This tells you where the market expects the Fed to be at the end of the year, 4.6. We're"
"3132980","3137500"," at 525 to 550, sorry, 525 to 550 right now on the target rate. "
"3138060","3139700"," So they're expecting around three cuts."
"3140340","3142860"," Well, you know, potentially by the end of the year."
"3143660","3144140"," Will that change?"
"3144560","3148940"," Will it drive treasure yields higher and will equities be able to hang in there still?"
"3148940","3153660"," Because the stock market has been pretty resilient in the face of these rising bond yields. "
"3153700","3156900"," Also inflation expectations in the tips market have been moving up as well."
"3157960","3163820"," Yeah, it has been a resilient market with the S&P of some 8.3% at this very moment."
"3164500","3165500"," We have AI. "
"3166120","3166580"," We have Google."
"3166880","3167420"," We have NVIDIA."
"3168100","3170160"," This is what's dominating the equity market. "
"3170480","3176620"," And it's counteracting some of the potential trepidation that you might see in firmer inflation and"
"3176620","3178380"," higher treasure yields."
"3178740","3181300"," The only other chart I wanted to show was what's happened with commodities."
"3181780","3183140"," It's kind of been this quiet rally. "
"3183380","3185140"," We haven't talked about very much."
"3185140","3188540"," But just in the last few weeks or so, you know oil prices are up."
"3189120","3193180"," Gasoline prices, cattle prices, orange juice prices. "
"3194060","3196720"," Coco is a whole nother can of worms that's stored."
"3197780","3198660"," Copper has risen."
"3198920","3203180"," They've come off the lows that we saw sort of toward the end of the last year. "
"3203180","3205200"," It's nothing not a crazy surge."
"3205200","3209960"," But it's worth watching because this field feeds into the real economy and into inflation."
"3211020","3215920"," Speaking of AI, of course, we do have a big story, at least the markets digesting this morning. "
"3216160","3218700"," Shares of alphabet, for example, up almost 6%."
"3218700","3224400"," This follows reports to the companies and talks with Apple that would have its Gemini AI engine,"
"3224600","3226740"," that is alphabets in Apple's iPhones."
"3227380","3233160"," Steve Kovac joins us now. "
"3233160","3234420"," Apple with so far this morning, Steve."
"3234580","3236180"," Yeah, this is a big and surprising one."
"3236320","3242240"," So the report saying Apple is in talks to license Google's Gemini AI to power upcoming features in"
"3242240","3242480"," the iPhone. "
"3242480","3245600"," That's according to a Bloomberg report that broke overnight."
"3245940","3250880"," Now this comes ahead of an AI announcement from Apple later this year, which CEO Tim Cook has"
"3250880","3253840"," already teased would be a breakthrough for the company."
"3254080","3256340"," Now Apple reportedly going to expand the deal. "
"3256340","3262780"," It already has with Google in search in which Google pays as much as $19 billion a year to be"
"3262780","3265420"," the default search engine on Apple devices."
"3266020","3270580"," It's unclear if Apple's going to be paying Google for the licensing here or if Google would just"
"3270580","3274240"," pay Apple so Gemini can deploy to billions of Apple devices."
"3275040","3279460"," Also, it's a vote of confidence for Google's Gemini, which as we've been reporting, has had a few"
"3279460","3284900"," high profile blunders since it was announced late last year, forcing Google to temporarily remove"
"3284900","3287500"," Gemini's image generation feature. "
"3287500","3292880"," The report also says Apple explored partnering with OpenAI, by the way, that's the same technology"
"3292880","3297540"," that Microsoft uses for its co-pilot product that it's been selling since last year."
"3298000","3302860"," And it's also an admission that Apple hasn't been able to make its own AI model that's up to par"
"3302860","3304600"," with what Google and others have."
"3305080","3308260"," And of course, there's this natural antitrust concern going on as well. "
"3308620","3314280"," Google and Apple are the only two mobile operating system platforms and a partnership like this"
"3314280","3319340"," could raise fresh concerns over at the Department of Justice, which, by the way, is expected to"
"3319340","3322680"," file its antitrust lawsuit against Apple any day now, guys."
"3323080","3329060"," Yeah, important to point out here, of course, this is all at this point still being negotiated"
"3329060","3329920"," according to Bloomberg."
"3330140","3330740"," Things can change. "
"3331060","3335960"," I mean, I do wonder, Steve, is it possible that Apple's negotiating similarly with some of the"
"3335960","3339060"," other large language model operators, so to speak?"
"3339420","3339860"," Yeah, it's possible."
"3339860","3344720"," It could be sort of a platform in the way that perplexity kind of offers you access to all of"
"3344720","3344840"," them."
"3344840","3347600"," That is the perfect example, perplexies that search engine. "
"3347600","3349360"," It's a startup funded by Jeff Bezos."
"3349780","3355600"," It uses all of them, basically uses OpenAI, it uses Enthropic, another startup that's a rival to"
"3355600","3356180"," OpenAI."
"3357100","3361720"," So, yes, you can also see a future in which they kind of stitch together all those different"
"3361720","3362460"," language models. "
"3362900","3367920"," But look, this is really going to come down to what they can show at their developers conference in"
"3367920","3372420"," June, which is when we're expecting to see the details of this AI announcement, Apple has been"
"3372420","3374620"," teasing all along, David."
"3374820","3374840"," Right."
"3375100","3379900"," And they're going to have to really show that they can do more with this AI Gemini technology than"
"3379900","3381420"," Google has already done on its own phones. "
"3381600","3383860"," It could do stuff like erase parts of a photo."
"3383940","3387900"," It could do some live translation between languages and things like that."
"3388120","3391640"," But it's nothing a breakthrough like what Tim Cook has been teasing. "
"3392020","3392500"," Yeah, I know."
"3392700","3393100"," Well, I wonder."
"3393280","3399540"," So, was it your expectation, and perhaps it still is, that Apple was going to have its own product,"
"3399540","3401700"," so to speak, its own large language model. "
"3401960","3405400"," I mean, clearly they have the ability to fund whatever is needed to do that."
"3405580","3405760"," Right."
"3405920","3406960"," And it's not just the own ability. "
"3407220","3409120"," They hired this man named John G."
"3409200","3413140"," and Andrea from Google several years ago in order to run AI."
"3413580","3418700"," So, it's really interesting that if they do have this, by the way, they do have their own large"
"3418700","3419280"," language model."
"3419440","3422100"," They've been putting out research reports and so forth on that. "
"3422400","3428880"," But if they don't feel confident about it, that it can be out there and put a partnership instead"
"3428880","3430260"," of doing something in house."
"3430720","3431000"," Yeah."
"3431340","3433600"," Well, a story that bears close watching. "
"3433800","3437140"," Appreciate your context on it and insight."
"3437320","3437720"," Thank you, Steve."
"3438200","3441600"," We'll stay on it, obviously, given the move in both of those stocks. "
"3441900","3443920"," Apple shares up almost two and a half percent as well."
"3444700","3445100"," Moving on here."
"3445240","3451460"," Proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, is backing Disney's board of directors in a report out this"
"3451460","3452040"," morning. "
"3453400","3455940"," Sarah, it's obviously something we've been following closely."
"3455940","3460220"," I'm sure you read both the New York Times story about Nelson Pelt's quite favorable, I would argue,"
"3460520","3464740"," and the Wall Street Journal story, perhaps not as favorable about his firm, Triann, over the"
"3464740","3465000"," weekend."
"3465220","3466360"," Interesting timing from both. "
"3466800","3467980"," We have been waiting for him."
"3468040","3470320"," We'll continue to get these proxy advisory firms."
"3470440","3475940"," These are the firms that essentially recommend and oftentimes can be influential in terms of how a"
"3475940","3476680"," vote should go. "
"3477420","3483800"," And in this case, when it comes to Glass Lewis, they side with Bob Iger and the management team."
"3483800","3487560"," I think we may have a bit of an excerpt here that we put together."
"3487840","3494820"," They say we believe there exists adequate causes to suggest Mr. Iger's return to the role has been"
"3494820","3500740"," accompanied by an appropriately sober assessment of Disney's recent failings and a correlated"
"3500740","3504620"," series of programs intended to remediate the company's less favorable footing. "
"3505100","3509320"," Under these conditions and absent further developments, we believe investors would best be served,"
"3509320","3510940"," supporting all of Disney's nominees."
"3510940","3512800"," It's a very complicated explanation."
"3514020","3518500"," But ISS will be interesting too, because they usually back in his pipe. "
"3518760","3523100"," They have in the past institutional shareholder services, perhaps seen as still the most"
"3523100","3525360"," influential of these proxy advisory firms."
"3525620","3527680"," Yes, so we'll see."
"3527880","3531540"," We're monitoring if both those guys have been meeting with investors, making their cases over the"
"3531540","3532280"," last couple of weeks. "
"3532720","3535320"," I do wonder how influential you said they're still pretty influential."
"3535320","3540820"," Disney is what they're in the 30% ownership of retail and has a high percentage of retail"
"3540820","3548280"," ownership, not unlike PNG, which was another very close context for Peltz and ultimately he"
"3548280","3549920"," prevailed and ended up on that board."
"3550140","3550380"," He did. "
"3550620","3552380"," I mean, those folks literally came down to."
"3552560","3553440"," They both claim victory."
"3553520","3553840"," They did. "
"3553920","3554460"," They both claim."
"3554580","3555100"," I remember that."
"3555320","3556080"," I remember it well. "
"3556380","3562280"," And obviously Mr. Peltz will use his time on the PNG board to support what he says is the reason"
"3562280","3564140"," he should be on the Disney board."
"3564140","3566320"," But otherwise, it's hard for us to get a sense of how it's going."
"3566820","3569680"," You know, I listen, people close to Disney. "
"3569960","3571920"," Their advisors seem very confident they're going to win."
"3572260","3574400"," But of course, that's what you'd expect them to say."
"3576100","3576960"," So does Peltz. "
"3577420","3577460"," Probably."
"3577760","3578080"," Yeah, I'm sure."
"3578460","3580160"," Well, I haven't talked to Nelson a little bit. "
"3580400","3580840"," Maybe you have."
"3581420","3584500"," As we head to break, here's our roadmap for the rest of the hour."
"3584700","3585860"," Energy rallying this month. "
"3585880","3587760"," The best sector, in fact, from March."
"3587980","3589860"," ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods is going to join us."
"3590160","3591700"," It's the first on CNBC interview. "
"3591700","3594460"," We'll talk about the outlook for oil and the company."
"3594820","3600660"," Plus, it is a red hot stock that's up almost 40% so far this year, up 175% in"
"3600660","3601760"," the past one year."
"3602560","3604740"," The company CEO joins us with his profit picture. "
"3605340","3607480"," And in video, it is front and center today."
"3607740","3610400"," That chip giant kicks off its AI developers conference."
"3610960","3612700"," Jensen Long's keynote speech. "
"3613340","3614180"," We're going to head there live."
"3614600","3616020"," You've got a big show ahead for you."
"3616060","3616440"," Don't go anywhere. "
"3775550","3776390"," Download the app."
"3778650","3780010"," Welcome back to Squawk in the street."
"3780170","3782250"," The world's top energy CEOs. "
"3782550","3785510"," So to speak, companies in that sector gathering in Houston."
"3785930","3788070"," It's called Sarah Week on Brian Sullivan is there."
"3788310","3791870"," He's got a first on CNBC interview with ExxonMobil's chairman of CEO Darren Woods. "
"3791910","3792210"," Brian."
"3793650","3794490"," Yes, David."
"3794690","3795250"," Thank you very much. "
"3795250","3798890"," Amanda, you know well and I know David's got a lot of questions probably about Guyana as well."
"3799110","3800970"," Darren, so we'll kind of tag team this."
"3801090","3801350"," Welcome. "
"3801450","3802250"," Good to see you again."
"3802250","3802430"," Thank you."
"3802590","3803810"," I want to start just with oil. "
"3804050","3804870"," Oil is at 80 bucks."
"3805430","3809630"," It's interesting because there's we always focus on supply."
"3810050","3811010"," Supply supply supply. "
"3811330","3812290"," How much is OPEC pumping?"
"3812390","3813190"," How much is Exxon pumping?"
"3813270","3814130"," How much is US pumping?"
"3815470","3820810"," Are we under estimating demand because just the other day, the IEA which had been more bearish"
"3820810","3825230"," raised its oil demand estimates for this year and next year."
"3825330","3826010"," How do you see demand?"
"3826410","3829990"," Well, I think the amazing thing is even with some of the challenges we're seeing around the world"
"3829990","3836870"," with global economies, the demand for petroleum products, gasoline, diesel, last year gasoline was"
"3836870","3837990"," at all time record highs."
"3838350","3840730"," Crude, as you know, is at all time record highs. "
"3840990","3844050"," And so the demand in my mind is still very, very healthy."
"3844850","3848430"," The margins that we're seeing in our refining business are much higher than they've traditionally"
"3848430","3849910"," been because of that extra demand."
"3850670","3856550"," And I put that in the context of an economy that's, it's not, it's doing okay, but it's not blowing"
"3856550","3857010"," and going. "
"3857250","3861070"," And so if economies around the world start to pick up, I think we're going to see a very tight"
"3861070","3862170"," supply demand balance."
"3862370","3866010"," I think demands are a very important part of the equation and probably one of the most difficult"
"3866010","3868070"," things to predict in our business."
"3868370","3869930"," Supplies, a lot easier to get your hands around. "
"3870270","3871690"," Demand is the more challenging."
"3871950","3876830"," Can you help us understand demand a little bit more because we've got record EV, electric vehicle"
"3876830","3881290"," penetration in the United States, sales, maybe not as strong as some had thought, but they're going"
"3881290","3884870"," up and there's no sign that they're going to fall any time soon."
"3885530","3890730"," And yet U.S. gasoline demand continues to rise as well. "
"3891050","3892450"," How do we square those two things?"
"3892770","3894770"," People want to be out and driving, frankly."
"3894930","3901110"," And if you look at as opportunities to, you know, to get out, see things drive around the country,"
"3901290","3901950"," that starts to grow."
"3902110","3903530"," These miles travel start to grow. "
"3903710","3911770"," And so while EVs are taking a place in that dynamic that doesn't, that doesn't, and itself cap the"
"3911770","3913210"," overall transportation industry."
"3913210","3918830"," And then as you step away from the U.S. and look more broadly, the growth in developing nations"
"3918830","3921210"," around the world is picking up."
"3921350","3923950"," And so we're seeing really high demand in places like India. "
"3924430","3925830"," China's got very healthy demand."
"3926150","3931170"," And so I think you got to break away from the U.S. centric perspective and think globally."
"3931450","3935210"," And when you start thinking about these economies, they're still coming up the economic ladder. "
"3935470","3937090"," And people's prosperity are growing."
"3937270","3938210"," You see more and more travel."
"3938750","3941270"," And I think more and more demand for traditional fuels. "
"3941270","3947730"," Do you think there is a fundamental misunderstanding, even at fairly high levels, about how the"
"3947730","3954670"," energy transition will play out vis-a-vis fossil fuels, in a sense that as the transition occurs"
"3954670","3960350"," toward more electrification, there are some who predict maybe a steep drop-off in usage, but I've"
"3960350","3966050"," seen other models that suggest, like in Norway, record EV penetration, oil and gas use has not gone"
"3966050","3973430"," down at all, that we misunderstand where we might be in 5, 10, 50 years on that curve."
"3973950","3978490"," So I think one of the things, the policy to date, and a lot of the narrative has been very"
"3978490","3983290"," focused on the supply side of the equation, having addressed the demand side of the equation and"
"3983290","3986250"," the impact that price has on demand."
"3986610","3989790"," And so I think as prices come off, demand tends to go up. "
"3989950","3991290"," It's very elastic on the edge there."
"3991870","3999350"," And at the same time, the cost of converting and moving to a lower carbon society, if that cost is"
"3999350","4001390"," too high for consumers to bear, they won't pay."
"4001510","4005930"," We've seen that play itself out in Europe with some of the farm protests, the yellow vest protests"
"4005930","4007630"," a year or so ago. "
"4007830","4013530"," So I think the piece of the equation that's been missing is cost price and the impact it has on"
"4013530","4014490"," people's standards of living."
"4014750","4016190"," Well, how do we balance that out in the States?"
"4016410","4017250"," We can learn from Europe."
"4017250","4021910"," I've been there many times reporting on this for CNBC, and we want a cleaner world. "
"4022030","4023730"," We want a lower carbon emissions."
"4023730","4025730"," We want to reduce ozone in the atmosphere."
"4025930","4028270"," We want to make sure that global temperatures don't rise. "
"4028790","4031590"," But yet to your point, at the ground level, people have to heat their home."
"4031950","4037110"," They've got to turn on the light and they either need to have it work or not go bankrupt from"
"4037110","4037350"," that."
"4037950","4041990"," We're seeing, are we going to start to see or have we already started to see a little bit of"
"4041990","4043870"," a push back here in the United States?"
"4044050","4045510"," In Europe, to your point, they're pushing back. "
"4045750","4047090"," Prices in the UK have doubled."
"4047670","4049430"," Four million people in what they call energy poverty."
"4049950","4052910"," What's the right balance here in the United States?"
"4052910","4057290"," Managing climate goals with making sure families can also afford it. "
"4057470","4061010"," Yeah, I think you're starting to see an evolution where if you go back in time, we were very"
"4061010","4066410"," focused on a very narrow set of solutions, solar, wind, and electric vehicles."
"4066650","4068190"," And that's all that people talked about around."
"4068470","4069350"," How are we going to solve the problem?"
"4069970","4076390"," With the IRA and the focus now on carbon intensity and reducing carbon intensity of transportation"
"4076390","4080250"," in the different sectors, you're now starting to engage the market more broadly. "
"4080250","4085230"," And I think the answer is going to be how to strike that balance is get to a focus on"
"4085230","4091610"," reducing emissions, emissions intensity, and then incentivizing businesses in the markets to"
"4091610","4093470"," produce products that have lower carbon intensity."
"4094110","4100029"," And that then engages all the players and opens up the aperture for as many solutions as people can"
"4100029","4104510"," come up with, helps drive technology in the right place just to start bringing down the emissions"
"4104510","4106590"," and doing it in the most cost effective way."
"4106590","4111630"," So engaging markets through carbon intensity specifications, I think is ultimately going to be a"
"4111630","4113109"," solution that we're going to have to use. "
"4113109","4118450"," I have not been to Guyana, but my friend and colleague David Faber has been to Guyana, so I know"
"4118450","4122590"," there's a lot, I think there's something going on around Guyana with you and Chevron and Hess."
"4122770","4126649"," David, you want to jump in here because you know the situation for the deal side and actually the"
"4126649","4128350"," Guyana side better than I do."
"4128810","4130689"," Well, sure, Brian, thank you. "
"4131010","4132130"," And Darren, good to see you."
"4132350","4137830"," On Guyana, you know, listen, you have a joint operating agreement with Hess, of course, in the"
"4137830","4143350"," operations outside on the shores of that country, and you're asserting a right or first refusal"
"4143350","4145450"," under that joint operating agreement."
"4145850","4147170"," Darren, why are you doing this?"
"4147430","4152109"," And given we haven't seen the language, why are you confident that when you go to arbitration as"
"4152109","4154510"," you are right now, that you will prevail?"
"4156590","4159170"," Well, I think you make the point about the joint operating agreement. "
"4159170","4166310"," So we have a contract that defines the parameters in which that partnership operates."
"4167069","4172529"," This area and the change of control and the rights that the existing partners have with respect to"
"4172529","4174850"," that change in control are spelled out in that document."
"4175210","4178229"," We wrote the document along with Shell back in 2008. "
"4178490","4184470"," Hess joined that venture in 2014 and signed into that document, so we're pretty familiar with the"
"4184470","4187470"," intent and the objectives and the language of that document."
"4188550","4195490"," Remember, David, as you know Guyana is one of the most successful deep water developments in the"
"4195490","4196390"," history of the industry."
"4196890","4201050"," We've played a major role in that as the 45% shareholder in the operator. "
"4201570","4207610"," We want to make sure that the rights afforded us in the JOA are recognized and conformed with, and"
"4207610","4213310"," that's really what this is about, is making sure that one, we have our rights secured, two, that we"
"4213310","4213550"," understand."
"4213950","4218430"," Within this Chevron Hess transaction, Guyana is a piece of it that we understand what the value"
"4218430","4223790"," that that transaction is putting on the Guyana assets, and then it gives us the opportunity to"
"4223790","4228010"," evaluate that on behalf of the company and our shareholders to make sure that we're making a"
"4228010","4231050"," decision that's in the best interest of the company and our shareholders."
"4231630","4237130"," Chevron has made it clear that if you were to prevail in this arbitration and actually have that"
"4237130","4241410"," right of first refusal that they obviously say they do not believe you have, they'll pull out of"
"4241410","4241750"," the deal. "
"4242330","4247190"," So it's not like there's going to be an opportunity for you to buy Hess's ownership stake in"
"4247190","4247530"," Guyana."
"4248230","4254190"," Again, given that, what would be the reason then to pursue this to its conclusion?"
"4255290","4258390"," Is it the potential value down the road for ExxonMobil?"
"4258890","4262370"," Is there option value perhaps that one day you might want to buy Hess?"
"4264290","4269810"," So I would tell you that the horizon that we're evaluating and the opportunity set that we're"
"4269810","4273490"," evaluating isn't limited to just the Hess Chevron deal."
"4273490","4280450"," That is a specific transaction that was developed between Hess and Chevron that frankly circumvents"
"4280450","4284210"," our rights in this and deprizes of the value opportunity. "
"4284890","4287430"," If not this deal, then maybe some other deal in the future."
"4287630","4288670"," I don't know what the future holds."
"4289110","4290730"," We didn't construct the Chevron Hess deal. "
"4291390","4292830"," We're just responding to it."
"4293010","4297710"," And so the question is I think more appropriately what happens down the road in the future, what"
"4297710","4298730"," does Hess decide to do?"
"4298970","4303450"," We want to preserve the options so no matter what, however the future plays out that we preserve"
"4303450","4306670"," the options and can do what's in the best interest of ExxonMobil shareholders."
"4308090","4309410"," How big can it be?"
"4309590","4311810"," If we could close the key to the NYC guys, thank you. "
"4311830","4312910"," I know it's tough to hear."
"4313550","4315330"," Nicely done though, by the way on that."
"4315470","4315930"," I couldn't hear anything. "
"4317370","4320330"," Bluefin, a new discovery in Guyana."
"4321070","4324310"," Just 1.2 million barrels a day potentially by 2027."
"4325170","4326990"," Is that a conservative estimate?"
"4327330","4328950"," If he can get to 1.2 by 2027?"
"4329170","4330830"," Listen, I think we're..."
"4330830","4331210"," Whoever owns it?"
"4331210","4335890"," We're developing it as expeditiously and efficiently as we can. "
"4336150","4341310"," And one of the outcomes of that, one of the consequences of that very expeditious development, one"
"4341310","4346770"," is the Guyana government benefits directly from that sooner, which is good for Guyana and the"
"4346770","4347450"," people of Guyana."
"4348010","4353710"," But at the same time there's a lot of work that we're doing in parallel and trying to understand"
"4353710","4355870"," how big is the opportunity."
"4356130","4358910"," So I would say our understanding of that resource continues to grow. "
"4358910","4360670"," Discoveries will continue to come."
"4360950","4362830"," And we'll continue to evolve our thinking on that."
"4363010","4366030"," So we're just basically given our best estimates of time. "
"4366150","4368370"," We'll update that as we learn more and we develop it further."
"4368850","4370190"," Alright, wrap it up with us."
"4370490","4375170"," You might have heard about this pause that we have on USLNG projects. "
"4375770","4378050"," Got a massive project in Texas."
"4378670","4380170"," Is that full steam ahead?"
"4380670","4380710"," Yes."
"4380930","4381610"," Even with..."
"4381610","4384370"," Is that the pause will not impact your project?"
"4384630","4385950"," The pause will not impact the project. "
"4386230","4386450"," That's right."
"4387110","4388410"," That's a nice clean answer."
"4388530","4389150"," Linda right there. "
"4389210","4391170"," Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil."
"4391630","4392230"," Kicking off."
"4392490","4393130"," Our Sierra Week coverage. "
"4393590","4394390"," Really do appreciate it, Darren."
"4394430","4395070"," Thank you very much."
"4395190","4395730"," Thank you very much. "
"4395730","4395930"," Sarah."
"4396570","4397230"," Alright, Brian."
"4397450","4397730"," Thank you. "
"4397930","4400130"," Looking forward to a lot more oil talk from you this week."
"4400370","4401550"," Brian Sullivan and Darren Woods."
"4401790","4402030"," Up next. "
"4402670","4403930"," Check out this mystery chart."
"4404150","4410270"," It's a consumer related name that's up 40% this year and 175% in the past 12 months."
"4410710","4411770"," We're going to talk to the company's CEO. "
"4412090","4415290"," Find out why investors are piling into the red hot name."
"4415290","4419570"," Plus, a closer look at the U.S. military's latest defense products."
"4420270","4425390"," Our Morgan Brennan joins us live in the sky with a look at what is still ahead on the show. "
"4425550","4426690"," I think this is the first Morgan."
"4428170","4428930"," Hey, Sarah."
"4429190","4429550"," So, I'm excited. "
"4430070","4431190"," UH-60 Alpha."
"4431390","4432070"," This is the Black Hawk."
"4432330","4433430"," Built by Lafayette Martin. "
"4433810","4434250"," Shakorski."
"4434890","4435670"," About 40 years old."
"4436090","4439070"," Also, the most advanced Black Hawk in the world. "
"4439450","4439550"," Why?"
"4440150","4440890"," It's fully autonomous."
"4441750","4442690"," We're about to say to the skies."
"4443070","4444430"," We're going to control the entire flight. "
"4444430","4445690"," On this tablet."
"4445950","4446390"," So, coming up."
"4446530","4447490"," We're going to do a deep dive. "
"4447890","4449210"," On the six billion dollars."
"4449210","4450130"," Of course, the business."
"4450370","4452470"," I'm going to push this button to execute right now. "
"4453150","4454110"," And we have takeoff."
"4454730","4456190"," See, I'm on the side of the screen."
"4458170","4466750"," Here we go. "
"4648720","4650700"," Welcome back to the squawk on the street."
"4650940","4653100"," I'm Contessa Brewer with your CNBC news update."
"4653480","4657560"," A new United Nations back report warns famine is imminent in Gaza. "
"4658200","4663460"," A new report suggests almost half of Gaza's population of 2.2 million people are facing"
"4663460","4668800"," catastrophic levels of hunger as Israel continues to wage war with Hamas in the enclave."
"4668800","4674420"," The most affected area is northern Gaza, which largely has been cut off from aid deliveries."
"4675080","4679720"," The report found almost two thirds of the households there have gone at least 10 days without"
"4679720","4681580"," eating in the last 30. "
"4682340","4686980"," The Supreme Court will consider today whether the Biden administration's attempts to combat social"
"4686980","4690060"," media misinformation violated the First Amendment."
"4690500","4696420"," The administration's accused of coercing platforms to remove problematic posts on issues like COVID "
"4696420","4698060","-19 and the presidential election."
"4698060","4703720"," And Uber reached a $178 million settlement with Australian taxi drivers. "
"4704260","4709500"," Thousands of drivers launched a class action lawsuit against the rideshare company, accusing it of"
"4709500","4714120"," breaking the country's taxi licensing rules when it started operating there in 2012."
"4714880","4718140"," The settlement is the fifth largest in Australia's history."
"4719040","4719260"," Sarah?"
"4719760","4720840"," All right, Contessa. "
"4721040","4721820"," Thanks, Contessa Brewer."
"4721820","4727040"," What we showed you, that red-hot mystery chart before the break, turns out it is Elf Beauty, the"
"4727040","4731480"," company ringing the opening bell this morning here at the New York Stock Exchange, celebrating 20"
"4731480","4731900"," years."
"4732420","4736100"," The stock has rallied over 2,000% over just the past five years. "
"4736420","4738920"," Chairman and CEO, turning on me and joins us now."
"4739640","4743880"," You have presided over this company for the last 10 years of its 20-year public life."
"4744500","4749260"," Why has it been such a moonshot kind of performance in the stock price?"
"4749260","4755780"," Well, I think it reflects our exceptional category, consistent category leading growth. "
"4756380","4759340"," We just finished our 20th consecutive quarter of net sales growth."
"4759600","4761420"," Our third quarter was up 85%."
"4761420","4763180"," We've more than doubled our market share. "
"4763340","4765440"," And I think investors are rewarding us for that consistency."
"4766000","4772680"," Is the growth driven by you entering new stores like Walmart and they've been in target for a while"
"4772680","4775560"," and new channels or something else?"
"4775940","4777600"," You know, we're seeing growth across the board."
"4777600","4781400"," Our number one driver of growth is productivity and the customers we're already in. "
"4781880","4784540"," Our digital business is up over 100% in the quarter."
"4785040","4787520"," Our international business is up over 100%."
"4787520","4789880"," So we're seeing really great growth across the board. "
"4790140","4791440"," And it's really driven by three things."
"4791760","4796680"," It's our exceptional value proposition, our powerhouse innovation, and our marketing engine."
"4796700","4799440"," They're all working together to really continue to propel our growth. "
"4799440","4804440"," People don't realize that it costs $40 to buy what a YSL or Dior lipstick."
"4805260","4807540"," And you're selling it for under 10."
"4808180","4811300"," Yeah, our lip oil is $8 versus a prestige item at $40. "
"4811960","4813860"," And consumers recognize the quality."
"4814320","4817320"," And as soon as we launch it, we never make a direct comparison."
"4817940","4822060"," But the products take off virally because everyone can't believe that they can get that quality. "
"4822060","4823560"," Virally, like on social media."
"4823900","4827580"," All throughout social media and TikTok on the various platforms we're on."
"4827900","4829400"," We have our own channel on Twitch. "
"4830160","4833040"," We're pretty broad based in terms of a lot of the social channels we're on."
"4833300","4837440"," So you're probably not rooting for TikTok to get banned in the U.S., which is under consideration"
"4837440","4838360"," now in the Senate."
"4838700","4841060"," Well, I think, you know, we live wherever our community lives. "
"4841380","4844740"," So if something happens to TikTok, we'll go to where our community is."
"4844840","4846360"," We're the number one brand amongst Gen Z."
"4847040","4851160"," We're growing amongst millennials, Gen X, and it really has to do with this unique engagement model"
"4851160","4853640"," of how we really engage and entertain our community."
"4853900","4855580"," So we'll find them wherever they're at. "
"4855740","4858520"," But would it be a material hit to the business in the short term?"
"4858960","4860440"," No, no, I don't believe so."
"4860620","4862400"," The reason for that is we're pretty broad."
"4862660","4866520"," If you take a look at our strength on Instagram, on Facebook, on TikTok, on Reels. "
"4867520","4869880"," Our platform is quite broad, including our digital advertising."
"4869980","4873360"," So we're not a brand that's dependent on any one platform."
"4873540","4876500"," Are you growing customers, or is it mostly repeats?"
"4876880","4877980"," No, we're definitely growing customers. "
"4877980","4881980"," If you take a look at our brand, just in the last few years, we've doubled our revenue to awareness"
"4881980","4884200"," from 13% to 26%."
"4884200","4888040"," And if you look at where that growth is coming from, certainly our strength in Gen Z."
"4888400","4893060"," But we're also picking up Gen X, millennials as well as now Gen Alpha."
"4893300","4894480"," So we have pretty broad base. "
"4895160","4897180"," We know that the category has been strong."
"4897440","4901180"," I mean, it's been an outlier for other sort of consumer discretionary goods."
"4901440","4901820"," They add target. "
"4902120","4903480"," They always call out grocery and beauty."
"4903820","4905180"," Those are the strong points."
"4905720","4911220"," What happens to your products in this inflationary period that we've had over the last two years or"
"4911220","4911440"," so?"
"4911860","4915040"," Well, I think one of the things that really comes through is our exceptional value proposition. "
"4915520","4918120"," So we have this incredible value every single day."
"4918480","4919700"," And I think that's benefited us."
"4919840","4923220"," Consumers realize they can get the high level of quality at these great prices. "
"4923640","4927460"," And you mentioned, target is our longest standing national retail customer."
"4928100","4928980"," We're their number one brand."
"4929260","4934720"," In the last four weeks, we had almost a 23% share of their entire category, which really talks a"
"4934720","4935500"," strength of alpha. "
"4935500","4937860"," I think the next highest brand was 13%."
"4937860","4940880"," So we feel that bodes well for us for the future."
"4940880","4942700"," But have your prices come up on products?"
"4943160","4944580"," No, we haven't taken our prices up. "
"4944660","4950160"," We've only taken two price increases in our history, one in 2019 in response to tariffs on China"
"4950160","4953940"," goods and one in 2022 when everyone's facing inflationary pressures."
"4954400","4956440"," A number of our competitors recently took pricing."
"4956440","4957400"," We decided not to. "
"4957440","4958600"," We want to hold it for an external."
"4959060","4961240"," Aren't your input cost going up?"
"4961640","4962240"," Not necessarily."
"4962240","4966340"," We have this virtuous circle, just because we have such strong top line growth. "
"4966900","4971360"," It allows us to have leverage in our non-marketing S&A, which in turn allows us to increase our"
"4971360","4974160"," margins and offer credit value every single day."
"4974240","4977300"," You mentioned the tariffs, and you do still do a lot of manufacturing in China."
"4978040","4983060"," So have you gamed out what would happen, say, in another Trump administration, where he has already"
"4983060","4984000"," threatened increased tariffs?"
"4984460","4984700"," We have. "
"4985020","4988920"," We're already carrying 25% tariffs on our goods."
"4988920","4995040"," So if some of those scenarios, if 60% tariffs, we'd use a combination of pricing and our"
"4995040","4996740"," diversification of our supply chain."
"4996880","5000580"," We have been diversifying with suppliers in the U.S., Thailand, Europe. "
"5001240","5004020"," And so we'll use a combination to be able to deal with that if that happened."
"5004360","5006740"," Do you want to move all the manufacturing out of China?"
"5007460","5008300"," I wouldn't say necessarily."
"5008880","5012760"," I would say we have a great advantage in terms of cost quality and speed, but we'll be prepared. "
"5013040","5014220"," We've been around 20 years."
"5014440","5016020"," We're gearing up for the next 20 years."
"5016920","5022160"," I could get, you know, we had, Alex Carp is on bashing the short sellers last week from Palantir. "
"5022280","5024340"," You have had short sellers in your stock."
"5024640","5028100"," You've managed, I guess, to smoke them all out with this performance."
"5028620","5033620"," But what has been the biggest, biggest doubt that you have had to address as the stock has soared?"
"5034300","5037900"," Well, I think, you know, usually you have people who feel like, did I miss the party?"
"5038240","5041520"," The stock is up so much over the last few years, but I've been hearing, I've been seeing over 10"
"5041520","5041740"," years. "
"5041940","5044660"," I've heard that all 10 years, and we continue to perform."
"5044660","5048100"," And I think part of the reason why is we have incredible whitespace."
"5048300","5050180"," We know we can double our market share in color cosmetics. "
"5050840","5054040"," We have two incredible brands in skincare with alpha-scan and auditorium."
"5054400","5055780"," And we're just getting started internationally."
"5056160","5058580"," So we have plenty of whitespace to continue to pursue. "
"5059120","5059880"," Look at that chart."
"5060140","5061600"," Taring, thank you very much for joining us."
"5061700","5063480"," It's great to see you here at the NYSE. "
"5063840","5065560"," Taring, I mean, from ELF."
"5066060","5070240"," After the break, the latest in U.S. military and autonomous technology."
"5070900","5075280"," Morgan Brennan is live from a chopper with a look at, but what is still ahead, Morgan?"
"5076660","5078940"," You guys are just talking about geopolitical risk. "
"5079440","5083240"," As the world has become the more dangerous place that needs more demand for more defense."
"5084280","5086200"," But the battlefield and what's needed is changing."
"5086560","5090620"," As more software, more AI, more economy, comes to the battlefield. "
"5091360","5095720"," So right now I'm inside a Black Hawk helicopter that is autonomously flying."
"5096100","5099320"," We are doing that off of its tablet right here."
"5099660","5100620"," Coming up on the other side of the break. "
"5100620","5105640"," We're going to do a deep dive into Lockheed Martin's $6 billion support speed business which had a"
"5105640","5106440"," critical juncture."
"5106960","5110500"," And what new capabilities like this are going to mean to the future approach."
"5110840","5111160"," Stay with us. "
"5299460","5304180"," While more conflict around the world has led to greater demand for defense products and weapons"
"5304180","5309460"," systems, but a rapidly changing battlefield means some of the longstanding and expensive military"
"5309460","5311820"," hardware is being reconsidered and reimagined."
"5312740","5314920"," Morgan Brennan is taking to the skies."
"5314980","5316220"," You've seen her up there already. "
"5316720","5317860"," And she has that story."
"5318060","5318340"," Morgan."
"5319600","5326690"," For this UH-60 Alpha Black Hawk helicopter, it's not just any Black Hawk. "
"5326850","5331370"," This was fully autonomous which means that the pilots are still under the front of this aircraft."
"5331990","5335690"," They can sit back and basically the computer can fly this helicopter."
"5335690","5338970"," That's what's happening right here on this tablet unmanned. "
"5339350","5340250"," First, a little bit of background."
"5340950","5344230"," Of course, this $6 billion a year business for Lockheed Martin."
"5344270","5346910"," It's 40% of rotary and emission systems sales. "
"5347110","5347910"," That's according to Jeffery."
"5348330","5352630"," It's a direct top line contributor to sales growth for Lockheed overall."
"5353510","5356410"," Now, of course, these next helicopters have actually invented them. "
"5356750","5362090"," It's busy ramping production on the Marines' new heavy legs helicopter and CH-53A."
"5362090","5365770"," But what it's perhaps best known for is a long-standing work force."
"5365930","5367690"," And that is the Black Hawk. "
"5367830","5371790"," The Black Hawk is many variants have been in the service of 45 years."
"5372010","5373630"," More than 5,000 events are delivered."
"5374290","5376270"," Three dozen countries as customers. "
"5376870","5379330"," The largest operator, though, is the U.S. Army."
"5379490","5381730"," That's really where investors have been focused lately."
"5382190","5387030"," After the Army straps plans for a high-profile bay ticket, competition for a new attack helicopter"
"5387030","5388230"," called Ferra. "
"5388230","5394790"," So, of course, they've been competing and were succeeded as a needed win after the company had lost"
"5394790","5401690"," another high-profile Army competition back in late 2022 called Ferra, which is actually to replace"
"5401690","5403750"," and supplement the Black Hawk."
"5404170","5407910"," Now, the Army is refurbishing some of those funds, including back into Black Hawk."
"5408390","5412150"," And it's focusing more of its efforts on a change in battlefield and what that's going to mean for"
"5412150","5413410"," the military of the future. "
"5413890","5416750"," Autonomy is a key part of that, which is why we're here."
"5416750","5419870"," Inside, this Black Hawk is joining me now to discuss all of it."
"5420170","5421510"," Is the President of support?"
"5421730","5422470"," He's Paul Lemo. "
"5422590","5426030"," Paul is great to be speaking with you while we're literally in the air."
"5426570","5428010"," You're doing a great job, priority."
"5429170","5432370"," Yes, I've been pressing some buttons with some expert health care. "
"5432890","5433850"," Why was it so necessary?"
"5434430","5438890"," This capability's been in the works for six years for this specific type of aircraft."
"5439230","5440870"," Why was it so necessary to develop this?"
"5441690","5446690"," You know, when you think about 21st century warfare, you really think about autonomy."
"5447150","5452030"," It underpins a lot of the capabilities that will be on the battlefield in the 21st century. "
"5452830","5454910"," We've been working this over a decade, as you've said."
"5455610","5461510"," And we built a system that's really platform agnostic, meaning it can be put on any kind of"
"5461510","5461750"," aircraft."
"5462210","5464050"," We put it on fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters. "
"5465330","5471410"," And it's a capability that allows the aircraft to either fly without anybody on it."
"5471410","5476570"," And the military might use that in contested, logistic situations where they don't want to put"
"5476570","5480370"," people in harm's way, but they have to deliver critical supplies to the troops."
"5481170","5483430"," It also can be used as a safety feature. "
"5483950","5489430"," It's a capability that will allow the pilots to land in degraded visual environments, which is"
"5489430","5493350"," something that has caused a lot of accidents, particularly for helicopters."
"5494510","5499370"," So do you already have customers for this technology, and perhaps just as importantly, is it a nice"
"5499370","5501450"," to have, or is it a need to have?"
"5501610","5502970"," Does it open up you have used growth?"
"5503670","5505690"," We think it's a need to have for the future."
"5506310","5510310"," And yes, we've been working with a number of different customers experimenting on how this can"
"5510310","5512030"," fulfill their capability needs. "
"5513770","5518850"," So what might have been, how does it speak to where the growth in general punishment supports me in"
"5518850","5519110"," the future?"
"5519350","5525330"," As we mentioned since $1 business for Lockheed, some changes in the Army, not involved in what is"
"5525330","5528570"," called future vertical legs, but money going back to Blackhawk."
"5528850","5529810"," We'll be doing it."
"5530170","5534390"," Yeah, so we're fortunate to have a very strong backlog at Sikorsky. "
"5534870","5539890"," We have three to five years worth of backlog for the CH-53K Blackhawks."
"5540510","5544810"," And the Army has said that with the cancellation of the fire program, they're going to go to"
"5544810","5547170"," another multi-year contract for Blackhawk production."
"5547950","5549770"," So that'll take us out through 2032. "
"5549770","5555530"," And then perhaps most importantly, they're committing to modernizing the Blackhawk to ensure that"
"5555530","5561490"," it's ready for 21st century battlefield, being able to interoperate with everything that's going to"
"5561490","5562010"," be out there."
"5562430","5568170"," And in longer term, we think things like autonomy and hybrid electric aircraft are going to be"
"5568170","5569150"," critical to our future."
"5569950","5575350"," Hybrid electric is certainly something that's coming to aircraft and aviation just as it did for"
"5575350","5575930"," automobiles. "
"5575930","5581350"," And we're going to be at the forefront of that technology and continue to innovate as we have for"
"5581350","5582930"," the last hundred years at Sikorsky."
"5583130","5587570"," So you're getting into the EDTAL game, or at least the hybrid EDTAL game, it sounds like."
"5587910","5588550"," We are. "
"5588890","5594230"," But we're going to stick to what we're good at, which is typically the heavy or medium lift long"
"5594230","5599410"," range type of missions, both for civil government and also for military."
"5599970","5604670"," Paul Lemo, thanks so much for joining me here and taking me off in this Blackhawk."
"5605370","5605930"," Appreciate it. "
"5606130","5606430"," Thank you."
"5606690","5611110"," Guys, the president of Sikorsky, we're going to have more on closing bell over time later today,"
"5611330","5613070"," too, as we continue deep dive into this portfolio."
"5614510","5616430"," Very cool to listen to and watch. "
"5616470","5617650"," Morgan, thank you so much."
"5617990","5620530"," Morgan Brennan from the sky of Connecticut."
"5621450","5624460"," Up next, shares of NVIDIA, 80% so far this year. "
"5624460","5629640"," The tech giant kicks off its AI developers conference today with a keynote from Jensen Wong."
"5629880","5631020"," We're going to head live to the big event."
"5631180","5632440"," Find out what did that stake here?"
"5632960","5634240"," What investors are expecting to hear?"
"5634420","5634860"," Stay with us. "
"5824940","5828300"," NVIDIA kicking off its annual GTC conference today."
"5828500","5830440"," Set to unveil its latest AI technology."
"5830640","5834080"," There's a lot of hope and expectation just given the stock price. "
"5834080","5836800"," Christina Parts and Evelos live from San Jose, California."
"5837560","5839820"," Christina, good morning with a look at what we can expect here."
"5841120","5843640"," Yeah, I'm in a parking lot right now because it is quite early. "
"5843960","5847740"," We're expecting 11,000 people at this big arena behind me."
"5847780","5852280"," That's how big, how many people they're expecting for a two-hour keynote from Jensen Wong."
"5852480","5854360"," You mentioned that. "
"5854440","5856580"," The stock is sort of over 80% in the last three months."
"5857040","5862540"," Shares have been volatile as of late, moving at least 2% out of 8 out of the last 10"
"5862540","5868220"," trading sessions on no particular news, which begs the question, what else can NVIDIA say to excite"
"5868220","5871720"," investors and how much is already priced into the stock?"
"5871940","5875960"," So to answer your question, Sarah, the first thing to expect is any new product updates and"
"5875960","5879360"," announcements, specifically specs of its latest AI GPU."
"5880120","5881440"," How much memory will it have?"
"5881820","5885960"," How does it compare with AMD's latest chip and maybe some details on the price point?"
"5886080","5888940"," Is it actually going to be 30% more than the H100?"
"5888940","5892080"," You know, it's going to be anywhere between 40 and $50,000. "
"5892780","5895560"," The second point is partnerships and collaborations."
"5895940","5899880"," Micron's earnings are out, for example, on Wednesday, but they alluded to a collaboration with"
"5899880","5902220"," NVIDIA, same for Oracle, Broadcom."
"5902540","5905880"," TSMC makes NVIDIA's chips so we could hear more on that partnership. "
"5906180","5910300"," And you could expect, as you can see, a sea of green right now, but sizable moves should NVIDIA"
"5910300","5911160"," have them on stage."
"5912100","5915580"," Lastly, demand sustainability and visibility into 2025."
"5915580","5920400"," Will inferencing, for example, be the next major driver for growth, now that many large language"
"5920400","5921660"," models are trained?"
"5922420","5926720"," And how will that expansion into other sectors like finance, healthcare, government, sovereign"
"5926720","5933260"," wealth funds help keep up the pace of growth and potentially change NVIDIA's total addressable"
"5933260","5936920"," market, which we know Jensen Wong has previously said it's about $1 trillion. "
"5937420","5938180"," So will that go up?"
"5938540","5943700"," So you have this big event, AI Palooza, the Woodstock of AI, the Gossip Pole of AI from the"
"5943700","5945780"," Godfather of AI, all of these terminologies."
"5946160","5952260"," But NVIDIA is now one of the largest or three largest stocks on the S&P 500, so any move"
"5952260","5957540"," or any sharp move in the stock will have an outsized impact on the NASDAQ and the S&P 500."
"5958520","5963300"," It kind of is hard to imagine that there's just so much that the biggest event has become a"
"5963300","5966240"," semiconductor's developers' conference. "
"5966700","5970020"," I mean, I remember when it was Apple, I don't know, does semiconductors usually do these?"
"5970440","5971940"," Because we've never really covered them before."
"5972140","5972460"," He does."
"5973000","5976640"," So this is the first one in five years in person. "
"5976940","5983260"," And previously, no, there was never this amount of attendees, 11,000 here, 16,000 over the course"
"5983260","5983800"," of two days."
"5984100","5985320"," There's no hotels for miles."
"5985900","5987600"," Everybody's walking around with a green lanyard. "
"5987880","5989960"," There's GTC, green signage everywhere."
"5990440","5993240"," It's so I just based off of the few years I've been covering it."
"5993340","5994840"," It's definitely nothing I've seen before. "
"5994840","5999000"," Even AMD was hosted in the same city but did have a much smaller presence."
"6001360","6007980"," Yeah, well, listen, it's not to be unexpected though, given the importance of NVIDIA and the"
"6007980","6009800"," current economy that we have right now."
"6010280","6011960"," Just think about it. "
"6012080","6016500"," I mean, we talk about it endlessly for any number of obvious reasons, right, Christina?"
"6018600","6019340"," Yeah, exactly."
"6019820","6022620"," And I guess the biggest point too is the impact on the markets right now."
"6022620","6025320"," If you're, you know, an investor that's watching like, I don't care. "
"6025520","6026780"," I don't follow semiconductors."
"6026780","6030520"," Well, you got to care because it's probably in some type of index fund you're holding, or it's"
"6030520","6032240"," going to have an impact on the S&P 500."
"6032700","6037240"," It's the third largest point impact for NASDAQ and S&P. "
"6037360","6038840"," So it affects everyone right now."
"6039000","6040580"," Those that are invested in the market."
"6041020","6042040"," Christina, thank you. "
"6042360","6045400"," And a reminder of course tomorrow on Squawk on the street."
"6046400","6047620"," There he is."
"6047620","6050320"," Exclusive NVIDIA CEO Jensen Long. "
"6050580","6055760"," That'll be live in the 10 a.m. hour with Jim Kramer, followed by a two-part interview later that"
"6055760","6057980"," day as well on Mad Money."
"6058200","6058720"," It's going to be good."
"6059000","6059380"," Oh, yeah. "
"6060200","6061460"," Leather jacket and all."
"6061740","6064640"," Check out shares of Hertz on the move."
"6065140","6067420"," They've actually been hammered down around 8%. "
"6067420","6071520"," So he has Stephenshire announcing that he is stepping down after just two years."
"6071660","6075740"," The company says GM's former crew, COO, Gil West will be taking over."
"6075740","6078760"," The change goes into effect on April 1st. "
"6078880","6083020"," I just want to, you know, there's a lot about this being written, being discussed about the failed"
"6083020","6083760"," EV strategy."
"6084500","6086660"," And that's certainly part of it here."
"6087000","6091440"," But from what I've learned, Stephenshire announced that he wanted to resign. "
"6091660","6092460"," It was his own decision."
"6092800","6094540"," He went to the board and they actually wanted to keep him."
"6094860","6096620"," He doesn't own the EV strategy. "
"6096880","6103440"," This company four months before their IPO back in 2021 actually decided to go all in buying Teslas"
"6103440","6105100"," and made a lot of promises about that."
"6105100","6111360"," He did preside over what happened since and leaned in and embraced the strategy, but ultimately put"
"6111360","6117000"," a stop to buying Teslas in 2022 when the demand wasn't there and then had to take a big financial"
"6117000","6121220"," hit when the price has got dropped and it weighed on Hertz."
"6121440","6125380"," So from what I hear, he just decided this isn't kind of the growth story. "
"6125900","6130000"," It's going to take someone who knows operations to just turn it around from here and fix it and"
"6130000","6131120"," deal with some restructuring."
"6131120","6131940"," Yeah."
"6132480","6137860"," A long line of leadership at Hertz gets a lot of quite a trigger to that. "
"6137960","6138140"," All right."
"6138260","6139940"," I will live market coverage."
"6140220","6140620"," Where are we?"
"6140780","6141000"," It will. "
"6141700","6142320"," Continues right."
"6312100","6312580"," See."
"6319920","6322540"," Good morning again and welcome to Money Movers. "
"6322540","6324480"," I'm Sarah Eisen with David Faber."
"6324580","6326500"," Live on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today."
"6327020","6332120"," Economist David Rosenberg on why the market isn't pricing in enough rate cuts out of the big Fed"
"6332120","6332960"," decision on Wednesday. "
"6333420","6339220"," Plus the CEO of Wheaton Precious Metals following strong earnings and with gold near all-time"
"6339220","6339480"," highs."
"6339900","6344320"," Then also that helping to boost the market on a report that is planning to team up with Apple to"
"6344320","6346920"," power AI technology on the iPhone."
"6347200","6351060"," We're going to take a look at what it means for Alphabet pulling a number of AI blunders. "
"6351060","6356180"," First up though, in the markets right now, we're starting the day off pretty strong with the S&P up"
"6356180","6357160"," more than a percent now."
"6357340","6359420"," It's just been pushing higher all morning long."
"6359620","6365240"," The NASDAQ leads up 1.6% thanks to Alphabet today, but also NVIDIA is higher out of its developers"
"6365240","6366100"," conference. "
"6366900","6368540"," We'll hear more about that later in the hour."
"6368800","6373160"," And Treasury yields are higher again, 4.33 as bonds sell off into the Fed meeting."
"6373820","6378820"," Expectations may be the Fed will signal a more hawkish tone on inflation and rate cuts. "
"6378820","6382200"," Let's bring in the CNBC senior market's commentator Mike Santoli."
"6382520","6387040"," Last hour we were talking about why the stock market has really been brushing off higher yields."
"6387320","6392200"," Because there was a time in the not too distant past where higher yields, firmer inflation, spooked"
"6392200","6392640"," the market. "
"6393320","6394540"," And now we've got the AI story."
"6395040","6396040"," I think it's a big part of it."
"6396160","6399740"," How much of the S&P 500 can we recast as an AI play, right?"
"6399940","6404540"," So today you had this nicely timed Alphabet Apple news to say we're in this too. "
"6405140","6406460"," NVIDIA is not the whole story."
"6406700","6407900"," Market grabs on to that."
"6408040","6410620"," Those were two stocks also that were big laggards over sold. "
"6410760","6412500"," So that works as far as it goes."
"6412580","6415680"," But I also think that so far yields are still in the range."
"6415940","6416600"," Yes, they're higher. "
"6417080","6420600"," Last week was a big jump, actually in yields, one of the bigger one-week jumps."
"6421000","6425300"," But it's still kind of below 4.5, 4.4 on the 10-year."
"6425660","6429020"," I think it's still allowing people to say maybe nothing much has changed. "
"6429560","6432140"," And finally, I mean it's because the economy's been relatively strong."
"6432140","6437700"," So yes, inflation expectations and inflation data have been firmer than expected or hoped."
"6438280","6440520"," But it's also coming with a better economy. "
"6440700","6442240"," And I think the market can try to look through that."
"6442320","6447340"," On the other hand, to take away the AI stuff, you really do have a market that's more in grind"
"6447340","6449160"," mode than in soaring mode."
"6449300","6453300"," I mean, over the last month, you've really had kind of a lot of chopping around a rotation as"
"6453300","6454400"," opposed to up up and away. "
"6456560","6458180"," Yeah, but we don't take away the AI."
"6458860","6459460"," You don't have to."
"6459580","6460220"," And we don't have to. "
"6460800","6464540"," You've got two largest market cap companies in the world today that are both up substantially."
"6464900","6467780"," Obviously, alphabet more so than Apple."
"6468100","6470000"," But nonetheless, adding a lot of market that. "
"6470140","6475460"," And for now, all you seem to need is that you're going to be participating in the investment cycle"
"6475460","6476560"," and the rollout cycle."
"6476880","6480480"," And, you know, alphabet's cheaper than it's been for most of its history."
"6480680","6484020"," So you can also make the case that people turned on it a little too much. "
"6484020","6488240"," I am focused, though, on, you know, it's another 50-50 up-down market breath day."
"6488460","6489960"," It's not as if we're buying everything today."
"6490240","6493800"," Energy, not so sneakily anymore, is performing pretty well. "
"6494100","6496040"," Not just the stocks, but crude."
"6496320","6496580"," Yeah, exactly."
"6496900","6499820"," So you've seen this, like, reflation move globally as well. "
"6500180","6501240"," See where that leads us."
"6501260","6501980"," Let's try it in that."
"6502500","6503360"," It's a really good question. "
"6503640","6505980"," I think part of it is just reversion to the mean stuff."
"6506180","6507600"," We are going after the laggards."
"6508080","6510900"," I think global growth expectations have improved in general. "
"6510900","6513020"," So there is a little bit of a demand story."
"6513760","6514760"," And, you know, the..."
"6514760","6515300"," The supply is tight."
"6515300","6519900"," Obviously, you sort of have some awareness of the supply challenges for oil in the near term. "
"6520360","6521060"," I might thank you."
"6521240","6521440"," Good setup."
"6521740","6522280"," Mike Santolias. "
"6522440","6522640"," Oh, wait."
"6522760","6523720"," We're going to stay on the economy."
"6523800","6526940"," Our next guest is still expecting a recession this year. "
"6527520","6528960"," It says all may already be starting."
"6529340","6533200"," Joining us now is Rosenberg Research President David Rosenberg."
"6533840","6535120"," It's always good to have you. "
"6535460","6539320"," You know, David, a lot of people would have thought maybe you would have thrown in the towel on the"
"6539320","6542860"," recession view because it just has not happened and we've seen this persistent strength."
"6543580","6547640"," And the economy, that's been part of the market story over the last year or two."
"6548160","6550140"," Why are you not abandoning that call?"
"6552000","6558080"," Well, because of the memories of 2007 when I was told the same thing and everybody was throwing in"
"6558080","6562640"," the recession towel except for, I think, me and Dick Burner over at Morgan Stanley at the time. "
"6563300","6568500"," So I was quite content in holding my ground in 07."
"6568500","6573480"," And I think that I'm going to be in good stead this time around too."
"6573580","6579260"," I just want to make the point that, you know, everybody seems to think that the economy is doing"
"6579260","6579600"," great. "
"6580440","6584480"," And I just heard Mike Santolias say that we have a pretty good economy in our hands because"
"6584480","6587500"," everybody is reliving last year's fourth quarter."
"6588040","6594400"," But, you know, we got some data last week and with the big downward revisions that we've seen with"
"6594400","6599560"," almost all the economic data over the course of the past couple of months, we have real retail"
"6599560","6602720"," sales so far in the first quarter, there's one month left to go."
"6602880","6609720"," Real retail sales, that's volumes, are running at negative 1.8% annualized in Q1. "
"6609920","6617500"," Industrial production is running at minus 5.6%. You have real sales and production contracting at"
"6617500","6618300"," the same time."
"6619160","6624580"," And historically, when that's happening and lets us in aberration, you have a four times greater"
"6624580","6626820"," chance of being in a recession than in an expansion."
"6627620","6632740"," So just a matter of time before, you know, if the data flow continues the way it has the past"
"6632740","6638420"," couple of months, I think the recession narrative is going to come back, you know, in a fuller"
"6638420","6639380"," view, shall we say?"
"6639760","6644740"," We're definitely watching retail sales on the weakness and even industrial production, but David,"
"6644740","6650220"," both of those data points aren't reflecting where the strength and the economy has been, which is"
"6650220","6651400"," in the services sector. "
"6651400","6656880"," And that's what's been hot on the inflation side, and that's what's been surprising, I think, on"
"6656880","6657800"," the growth side as well."
"6659460","6664360"," Well, you know, that's 100% true that the services side, you know, you have the reopening of the"
"6664360","6670600"," economy, them bumping against, you know, all the stimulus checks being spent, and that certainly"
"6670600","6673340"," provided a lot of impetus for service sector spending."
"6673900","6678940"," But you know, when you go back to the most recent Fed base book and you take a look at"
"6678940","6687200"," what's happening in terms of spending on travel and leisure, accommodation, restaurants, that's"
"6687200","6688460"," really starting to cool off. "
"6689160","6693480"," So I tend to agree with you that in the hard day that hasn't shown up yet, but anecdotally, it"
"6693480","6694320"," certainly is."
"6698000","6703520"," So where do you see recession, I mean, besides in the manufacturing sector and in some of the"
"6703520","6707700"," spending data, where and when do you actually see recession taking shape?"
"6707900","6711820"," I know you always say unemployment is a lagging indicator, but we're still below 4%, and the"
"6711820","6715480"," jobless claims are not lagging, and every week they continue to point to strength."
"6715700","6719620"," So as people have jobs and they get wages, how does that add up to recession?"
"6721040","6727020"," Well, you know, there's a huge dichotomy, Sarah, in almost all the data, and that includes the"
"6727020","6727720"," claims numbers. "
"6728080","6732760"," So the spot claim numbers have remained exceptionally low, and what it's telling you is that"
"6732760","6734620"," companies are not firing people."
"6735780","6738580"," However, look at the backlog of continuing claims."
"6739220","6747080"," They've continued to rise, and what that's telling you was that it's getting tougher and tougher"
"6747080","6748740"," for the backlog of unemployed. "
"6749360","6750640"," To find a new job."
"6751040","6757480"," And keep in mind something else, that we have a bull market in the part-time economy."
"6758400","6762680"," So when you go to the household survey, you're going to see that all the jobs and then some that"
"6762680","6765880"," have been created in the past year have been in part-time work. "
"6766560","6769660"," So if you're trying to answer the question, why the claims remain so low?"
"6769880","6774580"," Well, if you're a part-time employee, and let's say you do get laid off, you're not really eligible"
"6774580","6775560"," for unemployment insurance."
"6776280","6782340"," So there might be just some sort of downward skew happening from that development, but I'm still"
"6782340","6787480"," scratching my head that we would have a narrative, because, of course, people think the stock"
"6787480","6789160"," market and the economy are one and the same."
"6790500","6793340"," And the stock market, it's not been an earnings story. "
"6794260","6798540"," The Ford multiple has gone from 18 a year ago to 21 right now."
"6798660","6803180"," Three points of multiple expansion in a year is a one in 10 event."
"6803180","6811920"," But how can we be talking about a buoyant labor market when there has not been one net new full "
"6811920","6815940","-time job created in the United States over the 12 months to February?"
"6816700","6822240"," How do you square that circle to a narrative that we really have a robust labor market on a hands?"
"6822320","6828160"," I know that's the narrative, but I almost feel like I'm Christopher Columbus in 1492 standing in"
"6828160","6831380"," front of Isabella and Ferdinand trying to tell them, I know the world isn't flat. "
"6832380","6833220"," So I know that."
"6833340","6833600"," I don't know."
"6833720","6835680"," We keep on reliving last year. "
"6835780","6838080"," Last year's GDP growth."
"6839120","6844680"," Two thirds of that 3% growth came from the fact that the fiscal deficit in the context of a"
"6844680","6848880"," sub-4% unemployment rate, the fiscal deficit should have come down last year."
"6849300","6851380"," It expanded 25%. "
"6851380","6854000"," But that's not recurring this year."
"6854140","6857440"," We're running fiscal policy on a set of continuing resolutions."
"6857440","6859720"," There's no fiscal stimulus this year. "
"6860560","6861460"," So that comes out."
"6861780","6862620"," Not infrastructure."
"6863460","6864240"," Not infrastructure. "
"6864440","6866780"," But isn't that still coming through?"
"6867840","6869800"," What the AI craze?"
"6870020","6872660"," No, just the infrastructure spending from the federal government."
"6872980","6875600"," That's what I'm talking about, Sarah."
"6876220","6881660"," We had the biggest number last year in the economy was that the construction of manufacturing"
"6881660","6885240"," facilities in the US was up 60%. "
"6885240","6893200"," And so there's your subsidies for expanding chip capacity in the US."
"6893400","6894180"," That's already started."
"6894460","6896240"," But what was industrial production last year?"
"6896940","6897700"," It was zero. "
"6898360","6900440"," So it's almost like a Potemkin economy."
"6900660","6901840"," We're creating these facades."
"6902460","6908120"," So we have 60% growth in the construction of manufacturing production facilities with no growth in"
"6908120","6909180"," actual industrial production. "
"6909880","6911400"," So interesting dichotomy."
"6911400","6916120"," But that when I said that the two thirds of the growth from fiscal, it was both the actual"
"6916120","6922280"," expansion of the deficit and all the multiplier indirect impacts that gave you that 3% GDP."
"6922680","6925080"," Two thirds of that growth last year was fiscal policy. "
"6925260","6930620"," So here's my final question relating to the market question in the event of the week, which is the"
"6930620","6930840"," Fed."
"6931500","6938860"," If the economy is as weak as you described, why isn't inflation coming down faster and further in a"
"6938860","6943180"," more decisive way, where we don't have to wonder is it now going to be two cuts instead of three"
"6943180","6945200"," cuts and maybe they're going to push that out even longer?"
"6946300","6950440"," Well, you know, again, I don't know why you say that, but I know that's again a popular narrative."
"6951220","6958320"," You know, we've had a couple of months of a roadblock, but nothing losing a straight line, not even"
"6958320","6958620"," inflation. "
"6959140","6963820"," But when you strip the shelter component, for example, out of the CPI."
"6963820","6967260"," And we know that that is a lot suggested."
"6967720","6974160"," I mean, 27% of the CPI, the owner's equivalent rep, which is one question to a sample of"
"6974160","6974500"," households. "
"6975100","6977640"," You know, what can you rent your, what do you think you can rent your house out for?"
"6977980","6985120"," When you strip out shelter out of the CPI, Sarah, the inflation rates running at 1.8. A year ago"
"6985120","6985900"," is running at five."
"6987020","6994100"," The core X shelter is running at 2.2. This time last year was running a 3.7. So are"
"6994100","6998920"," we going to bang our heads against the wall because of monthly gyrations and wiggles in the data?"
"6999120","7000620"," Or do you want to take a look at the big picture?"
"7001280","7005340"," So you strip shelter out of the equation and inflation is already running below target."
"7006420","7009700"," On the CPI, not necessarily on the PCE. "
"7009840","7010720"," It's not weighed as much."
"7011000","7012820"," I think the next big E is March 29."
"7014000","7019720"," Same thing with the PCE, you know, for all the hand ringing over the PPI number last week. "
"7019720","7020120"," Yeah."
"7020400","7024280"," We were just going crazy looking at the month to month gyrations in the data."
"7025000","7028500"," The year of your trend, let's look at the big picture, the PPI, okay?"
"7029020","7029560"," Where's it running?"
"7030140","7037340"," With all the anxiety and angst from last week and as Mike Santoli said in the run up and bond"
"7037340","7043000"," yields, I mean, the year of your trend in the PPI is the grand total of 1.6%. It was"
"7043000","7044900"," 4.7 this time last year. "
"7045400","7048000"," The core PPI is running at 2% on the nose."
"7048460","7050760"," It was 4.6% this time last year."
"7051380","7055300"," So do you want to pay attention to the monthly wiggles in the data?"
"7055600","7060340"," Or just look at the fundamental big picture that the disinflation momentum is still fully intact?"
"7061420","7061840"," All right. "
"7062080","7062620"," It's a view."
"7062840","7063420"," David, thank you."
"7063520","7065700"," We certainly appreciate you coming on to talk about it. "
"7066600","7067060"," Take care."
"7067580","7068760"," It's from Rosenberg Research."
"7070720","7074980"," Well, after notching new all-time highs, gold did fall a bit last week. "
"7075180","7079040"," It was its worst weekly performance since the end of last year."
"7079340","7082820"," We're going to look at that move next with the CEO of Wheaton Precious Metals."
"7083640","7085140"," Plus we'll break down the company's earnings report. "
"7085640","7088720"," It was an increase in its dividend that went along with that as well."
"7089260","7091000"," We're also going to get to Tesla, of course."
"7091300","7093600"," Goldman Sachs is moving its price target on the name. "
"7094040","7094960"," We will share the update."
"7094960","7099160"," Money movers back in just a moment with a Dow up about 160 points."
"7287020","7291360"," So Tesla are up almost 6% so far this morning. "
"7291880","7296320"," Despite Goldman Sachs lowering its price target on the stock by some $30."
"7296960","7299200"," Now it is a $190 price target."
"7299400","7300260"," That's a little above where it is. "
"7300420","7302960"," Production headwinds tied to the Red Sea conflict."
"7303460","7307560"," That Berlin power loss at their plant in Germany a few weeks ago."
"7307560","7310880"," The catalysts as well, specifically impacting its model three pace. "
"7311320","7312360"," Sharers have had a rough start."
"7312520","7314060"," Of course, we've talked about it often to the year."
"7314220","7316500"," Still down some 30 plus percent. "
"7317480","7319860"," But Sarah, it's having a nice update."
"7320300","7322940"," After again, last week, still sort of treading water at best."
"7323420","7324780"," Helping the Nasdaq as well. "
"7324920","7329080"," It's not even one of the better Google, Apple and Vidya are all doing even better right now."
"7329520","7331960"," As far as Nasdaq performance, which is why we're seeing a big game."
"7332580","7335260"," On Stern to Gold, our next guest is one of the biggest players in mining. "
"7335260","7338240"," He joins us after reporting an earnings beat late last week."
"7339040","7342380"," All his prices keep hovering right around record high set earlier this month."
"7342520","7346460"," Joining us now in a CNBC exclusive is precious, written precious metal, CEO Randy Smallwood. "
"7346960","7347740"," Randy, welcome back."
"7347940","7348300"," Good to have you."
"7349180","7350180"," Always good to be here, Sarah. "
"7350420","7350600"," Thanks you."
"7351140","7356680"," So what is driving the price of gold, which is clearly helping out your margin story?"
"7356940","7357920"," Is it about central banks?"
"7358900","7359680"," Yeah, exactly."
"7360080","7365240"," We're seeing a lot of central bank buying a lot from China, but we're also seeing Singapore and"
"7365240","7370920"," Turkey and Poland to a little bit lesser extent and a number of other smaller countries, but a lot"
"7370920","7371860"," of central bank buying. "
"7372100","7375720"," And we are seeing that because the equities just aren't getting the same level of attention."
"7376160","7379460"," And so it clearly indicates the central banks are really driving the price here."
"7379720","7383580"," They're buying actual physical gold in large amounts. "
"7383840","7384460"," Is that sustainable?"
"7386120","7389920"," Well, the price is what adjusts to make it sustainable."
"7390880","7392280"," That's what's pushing the price up."
"7394120","7399480"," A lot of those sovereign banks have a pretty healthy US dollar reserves in there. "
"7399620","7402780"," And I really look at it as they're swapping out US dollars for gold."
"7403200","7404700"," And that's what's pushing gold prices up."
"7405720","7407020"," Because they want to get out of dollar?"
"7407220","7408540"," Is it like a geopolitical statement?"
"7409000","7410020"," What do you think is driving it?"
"7410680","7414980"," Yeah, I think it's probably just more of an apolitical statement. "
"7414980","7419460"," They just like having something in their central bank reserves that doesn't have political"
"7419460","7420320"," influence to it."
"7420440","7424780"," And that's one of the advantages of gold is that it can't be influenced from outside."
"7425160","7427620"," And so it's purely on a demand basis. "
"7427780","7430180"," And I think it's just a shift towards that safety, that security."
"7431020","7435520"," We have had to move up, you know, Sarah pointed it out a little while ago and some other"
"7435520","7439100"," commodities, copper and the like, that part of this as well?"
"7439960","7440940"," Well, I wouldn't think so."
"7440940","7446500"," In central banks, I mean, when it comes to copper, there's no doubt that good sources and good"
"7446500","7450840"," supply of copper is going to be something that we need as a society for many years forward. "
"7451100","7454660"," And it's getting tougher and tougher to build and operate copper mines around the world."
"7455340","7458220"," And so existing supplies are going to become even more valuable."
"7458520","7464720"," And I really do think that that's more of a drive-on statement on the economy in terms of the"
"7464720","7466620"," needs for electrifying the world. "
"7466620","7469720"," Well, then I guess back to central banks, when are they sated?"
"7469920","7472480"," When have they, you know, replaced enough dollars with gold?"
"7472780","7474880"," Do we have any sense for that?"
"7476380","7481300"," Well, I hope it's, I mean, to me, I see a good movement in that direction."
"7481300","7482480"," I think it's got some good flow."
"7483340","7489580"," I'm more excited about the concept of having, you know, the broader population start to realize the"
"7489580","7493580"," same reasons behind that and starting to wake up more of a retail investment space. "
"7493800","7495060"," And we are starting to see some movement there."
"7495060","7500960"," We're starting to see a bit more activity on the equities and, you know, the ETFs are still sort of"
"7500960","7501860"," flattening out."
"7501960","7503800"," They're not losing as much as they were in time pass. "
"7504020","7507220"," So that tells me that we are starting to see a bit broader uptake in the gold space."
"7507720","7512660"," So besides gold, which is obviously fun to talk about right now, because the price is moving, you"
"7512660","7518680"," also mine palladium, right, and silver, and I'm curious what your strategy is, where you see the"
"7518680","7521840"," biggest opportunity, because I know you've been doing some acquisitions as well to expand the"
"7521840","7522540"," geographic footprint."
"7523160","7527740"," Yeah, first, we had a really busy year last year and we're first steps into Africa. "
"7527740","7532360"," We invested into the Platt Reef Project in South Africa and we also stepped into a gold, a healthy"
"7532360","7533340"," gold project in Australia."
"7533500","7536040"," So, so we definitely have expanded into the space."
"7536680","7541820"," You know, out of all the commodities, silver definitely is something that's going to play a role in"
"7541820","7547320"," where we are going as a society in terms of electrifying silver conduction electricity better than"
"7547320","7547860"," any other metal. "
"7547860","7551760"," So if we want more solar panels and we want stronger mobile electronics, whether it's smartphones,"
"7552780","7558020"," smart watches, smart rings, smart cars, silver will always play a bigger role in that."
"7558520","7562560"," And again, one of the challenges that we're seeing around the world is it's tougher and tougher to"
"7562560","7565900"," supply the materials to get the permits to operate mines."
"7566280","7570520"," And so that means that any assets, any companies that have good solid assets is just going to"
"7570520","7573460"," become more and more valuable as we move forward. "
"7574720","7578460"," What is the difference between a streaming company and a mining company?"
"7578460","7582740"," Because it sounds like that's something that analysts have been focused on as it relates to your"
"7582740","7583240"," acquisitions."
"7584200","7586340"," Well, I think the biggest difference is risk."
"7586920","7591820"," We sign contracts where we get metal delivered to us, a portion of the production delivered to us"
"7591820","7592760"," at a fixed price. "
"7593340","7594520"," And so we don't have any cost risk."
"7594700","7599180"," That's the huge advantage of a streaming company is that we deliver all the exploration and"
"7599180","7603940"," expansion potential from a good mine, but we don't have the capital cost risk."
"7604100","7605460"," We don't have the operating cost risk. "
"7605460","7606300"," Our margins are fixed."
"7606560","7607380"," Our margins are defined."
"7607980","7608840"," Our costs are fixed. "
"7609520","7613220"," And so, you know, to be honest, we're about, you know, from a risk perspective, we're not much"
"7613220","7614640"," different than owning gold bullion."
"7614760","7618560"," But the difference is we also supply exploration success, expansion potential."
"7619040","7624820"," And so, you know, we really are the, I think, the best of all worlds in terms of owning the"
"7624820","7626380"," metal versus owning the mining company. "
"7626860","7630600"," We deliver the best of the mining company and the best of the metal."
"7630900","7632600"," So it's a really unique business model."
"7632820","7633760"," This is our 20th year. "
"7633760","7636320"," We created this business model 20 years ago."
"7636400","7642280"," And so we're celebrating, you know, it's a new financing mechanism that really opens up, I think,"
"7642280","7648040"," an excellent way for generalist investors to dip their toe into the gold space, into the precious"
"7648040","7648520"," metal space."
"7649380","7650480"," Thanks for explaining it. "
"7650580","7651140"," Randy, thank you."
"7651260","7652200"," It's good to talk to you."
"7652860","7653580"," Always a pleasure. "
"7653820","7654220"," Thank you, Sarah."
"7654340","7655160"," Randy Smallwood."
"7655360","7657000"," Who needs semiconductors, I guess?"
"7658240","7658500"," And the power. "
"7658860","7659020"," Silver."
"7659780","7660000"," All right, everything."
"7663760","7665360"," It's really, you may need their chips, too. "
"7665500","7667740"," In fact, a lot of people seem to need them."
"7667880","7670400"," NVIDIA is hosting that developers conference this morning."
"7670960","7676380"," It will discuss the latest in advances, of course, in AI. "
"7676840","7682700"," It's GPUs that fuel so much of the generative AI programs that are going on right now."
"7682860","7683760"," We're going to be live in San Jose."
"7684020","7687760"," We'll take a look at whether this massive surge in demand will continue. "
"7691730","7696070"," For me, a change maker is someone who forges their own path and makes it wide enough that others"
"7696070","7696950"," can come along with them."
"7697230","7700470"," One thing I wish I'd known when I was starting my career is that there is a difference between"
"7700470","7703370"," something that is impossible and something that is just hard."
"7703890","7707810"," And the reason why that is important is people can do hard things. "
"7708190","7710850"," You have to ask yourself, okay, is this just hard or is it impossible?"
"7711250","7715630"," Because impossible is impossible to do, but something that's hard may be a self-imposed constraint"
"7715630","7717530"," and people can do hard things."
"7931310","7931710"," See."
"7936410","7942010"," European markets editing slightly lower this morning after CPI comes in in line with expectations,"
"7942630","7946770"," both the core and headline numbers falling on a year over year basis from last month. "
"7947170","7951310"," China has a bright spot on the economic front, industrial output, beating expectations in February,"
"7951810","7956150"," growing from the last read, though not all positive data there, retail sales, slightly beating"
"7956150","7961490"," annual assessments, but slowing still by nearly 2% from December and unemployment unexpectedly"
"7961490","7962230"," jumped."
"7962710","7969070"," Turning to Japan, some concerns over a sluggish economic picture, the core machinery orders in"
"7969070","7974310"," Japan comes in below expectations in January, prompting the government to lower its view of orders"
"7974310","7979670"," to, quote, showing some weakness from stalling for the first time since November 2022."
"7980110","7984670"," This all comes as the Bank of Japan kicks off its two-day policy meeting, where it is expected to"
"7984670","7988710"," scrap negative interest rates, raising rates for the first time since 2007. "
"7989470","7994610"," Investors aren't worried though, the Nikkei went up again more than 2% today, I think on the"
"7994610","7999250"," economic weakness that we're seeing in Japan, which may restrain just how much they're able to"
"7999250","8002790"," hike, now that they're going to get set to lift interest rates."
"8002990","8005690"," Right, but overall the story has been a positive one on the economy."
"8005690","8008310"," What are these signs of weakness specifically that were?"
"8008610","8010990"," The GDP has shown weakness. "
"8011310","8014410"," They barely managed to escape recession to negative quarters of growth."
"8014410","8019090"," You're seeing it in the, no surprise in the manufacturing sector, because exports around the world"
"8019090","8025510"," have been weak and manufacturing around the world has been weak, but what's strong in Japan is the"
"8025510","8025810"," corporate."
"8026230","8031270"," First of all, wages and prices have increased, but also these companies have made some big"
"8031270","8035470"," adjustments just in terms of their governance, governance, which is the way. "
"8035730","8036490"," No more productivity."
"8037410","8042910"," Some of the traditions have fallen by the wayside in terms of lifetime employment, for example."
"8042910","8047590"," I'm listening, I think, to outside investors, which we're hearing a lot more just anecdotally,"
"8048310","8050390"," whereas you would have never been able to do that in Japan. "
"8050670","8054390"," Anyway, all of it has powered this boom in the Nikkei, which is near record high."
"8054690","8057870"," Yeah, although it took a really long time for it to get back to its records, let's not forget."
"8058130","8060590"," No, it was a few decades of stagnation. "
"8061030","8062170"," It was a number 30 years of stagnation."
"8062870","8064370"," Alright, let's get to a news update."
"8064570","8066230"," Sylvana now has that for us, Sylvana. "
"8066530","8067670"," Hey David, good morning."
"8067670","8075070"," Donald Trump has not been able to get a bond to secure the $464 million fraud judgment against him."
"8075510","8078350"," The revelation came out in sport filings this morning. "
"8078850","8084430"," The former president and his company would need to post a bond for the full amount by next week in"
"8084430","8089150"," order to stop the New York Attorney General from being able to collect the money while he appeals."
"8089670","8094770"," The court documents say Trump has approached 30 surety companies through four separate brokers."
"8094770","8099090"," His attorney saying securing the bond is a quote, practical impossibility. "
"8099790","8104590"," Meanwhile, President Biden is expected to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu"
"8104590","8105230"," today."
"8105830","8110430"," It will be their first conversation in more than a month and their first since Senate Majority"
"8110430","8116730"," Leader Chuck Schumer called for Netanyahu to be replaced in elections after the war in Gaza ends."
"8117490","8122670"," The first over-the-counter birth control pill in the U.S. is now available to buy online. "
"8122670","8129090"," The old pill cost about $50 for a three-month supply or about 90 for a six-month supply."
"8129530","8134810"," The FDA approved the oral contraceptive for over-the-counter use back in July, Sarah."
"8135170","8135710"," I'll send it back to you. "
"8136090","8137250"," All right, Sylvana, thank you."
"8137910","8142230"," Truist and HSBC, the latest Wall Street firms to hype their NVIDIA price targets."
"8142750","8144670"," Truist is now at $1,177. "
"8145830","8149590"," That says NVIDIA Developers Conference kicks off right now in San Jose."
"8149590","8153310"," And San Jose is where we find our Christina Hartsenevelas."
"8153470","8155750"," Great expectations for today, Christina. "
"8156890","8158310"," Yes, great expectations."
"8158530","8162210"," You find me in a parking lot right now, but that's because the event hasn't started yet."
"8162610","8168550"," Even though NVIDIA was down four out of the five sessions just last week, it actually grinded out"
"8168550","8170890"," its tenth positive weekly gain. "
"8171270","8177110"," That is the longest on record, and shares are already up today, as you can see in the grid, ahead"
"8177110","8180910"," of this big graphic processing unit tech event at San Jose, so GTC."
"8181630","8187210"," In order for this to not become a sell the news kind of event, investors will be looking for one"
"8187210","8188030"," main theme."
"8188330","8191450"," That's demand sustainability beyond this year and next. "
"8191469","8196850"," And that includes, yes, product updates on the H200 chip, which is another GPU chip."
"8197070","8201389"," The newest GPU chip, which is going to be the B100, expected later this year."
"8201389","8205889"," Ethernet switches, edge products, the growing software ecosystem. "
"8206590","8211830"," All of that could contribute to an increase in their total addressable market, their TAM."
"8211990","8217530"," So recently, Justin Wong, the CEO said that AI systems will grow, or that specific market will grow"
"8217530","8220490"," from one trillion to two trillion in the next five years."
"8220709","8224010"," Today, we're going to be looking for details on what that means per year. "
"8224010","8227730"," For example, I saw one note that said maybe it'll be $500 billion for you."
"8227770","8229690"," This is the total AI system market."
"8229690","8235889"," So if, you know, Justin Wong goes on stage in that two-hour presentation and upset number, this is"
"8235889","8240170"," going to go beyond NVIDIA's stock, and it's going to move and have an impact in other names like"
"8240170","8243290"," Super Micro, Broadcom, AMD as well. "
"8243650","8248690"," Since the AI market as a whole is expected to grow, and it's going to reinvigorate this trend."
"8249309","8253410"," For the demand sustainability theme, though, we're going to also need to hear more about NVIDIA's"
"8253410","8258150"," penetration beyond hyperscalers, like the, you know, the ones with deep pockets, Microsoft, Amazon,"
"8258150","8259610"," Google, Meta, et cetera."
"8259790","8264389"," And we're going to hear more about governments, sovereign wealth funds, health care sector, the"
"8264389","8270590"," finance sector, so that there is continued confidence in this astronomical pace of growth for"
"8270590","8270790"," NVIDIA. "
"8271030","8272010"," That's what we need to hear."
"8272530","8277090"," Instead of just these, you know, catchy fridges of AI, Palooza, the Woodstock of AI, the Gossip"
"8277090","8281969"," Pole of AI, NVIDIA is now one of the three largest S&P 500 stocks."
"8282309","8286790"," So any sharp move that we see today will have an outsized market impact on the markets. "
"8287190","8290709"," I wonder if they talk about China and the chip that they're designing for that market, because"
"8290709","8297309"," that, I feel like, has been a big focus for investors and potential big growth driver if they get"
"8297309","8297650"," it right."
"8298209","8307670"," Oh, yeah."
"8307670","8312170"," We know the latest earnings report, that dropped to mid-single digit. "
"8312389","8315510"," So it's actually decreased quite dramatically because of those export controls."
"8316070","8317770"," There are rumors that, well, not rumors."
"8318010","8323030"," NVIDIA has said that they've created chips for the market that are able to be shipped and able to"
"8323030","8323809"," be licensed out. "
"8323950","8325510"," So they're in the green so far."
"8326250","8330330"," To your point, I haven't seen as many notes or as many comments about this."
"8330450","8336070"," There could be a possibility, but I think maybe they'll be more focused on the launch of the two AI"
"8336070","8340410"," chips, the H-200 and then the B-100 for this year, and then another one for next year that"
"8340410","8341570"," may get more of the focus. "
"8341809","8345770"," But I'm sure China will come up because it is such a large contributor to their data center"
"8345770","8346090"," revenue."
"8346510","8351750"," And we know if there's a Trump presidency that could really change in the next year or so."
"8352070","8352370"," Yeah. "
"8352690","8357709"," No, I guess your point is the sexier, more innovative stuff is what's in focus today."
"8358190","8358750"," Christina, thank you."
"8359270","8360070"," Christina Prince and Evelyn. "
"8360070","8365129"," A long time Nike bull downgrades the stock to sell this morning ahead of its Thursday earnings"
"8365129","8365450"," report."
"8365670","8367070"," We're going to talk to the analysts behind the call next."
"8599920","8602600"," A note on Nike grabbing our attention today. "
"8602800","8607820"," Williams downgrading the retailer to sell, saying its strength will continue to diminish, arguing"
"8607820","8612640"," that it seems like it's relying more heavily these days on consultants than company experts to"
"8612640","8613860"," drive strategy decisions."
"8613860","8617660"," The analyst behind the call joins us now, William Trading's Sam Poser."
"8618040","8621840"," And Sam, I really wanted to talk to you about this call because you and I have been talking about"
"8621840","8623120"," Nike for years. "
"8623460","8625380"," How long have you been covering this company?"
"8626960","8627440"," Years."
"8627880","8630920"," I think it's in 2007, 2008, something like that."
"8631180","8632140"," So 17 or so years. "
"8632920","8636300"," And you have loved this company and you're one of the biggest fans."
"8636820","8638520"," This note has a very different tone."
"8638820","8639500"," What's changing?"
"8641500","8647580"," I think they're sort of sitting back on their heels a little bit. "
"8647780","8650680"," We keep seeing more of the same product coming out."
"8651240","8657340"," We see decisions that to release products."
"8657340","8664540"," They did some shock drops on the Jordan 11 over Christmas shoe ahead of it. "
"8664540","8667540"," So prior to the real launch in December."
"8668280","8672980"," The product was already being sold at or below retail on third party websites."
"8673240","8679540"," We got a comment from Hibbit the other day that their launch product wasn't as good as it had been. "
"8681220","8687240"," Nike, Nike basketball, Nike running have been not as great as they have been."
"8687600","8694560"," We get the impression that they're pushing a lot of the product into let's say footlocker in those"
"8694560","8695080"," categories."
"8696000","8702180"," Really not demand planning as well as they should be. "
"8702640","8710660"," And we think that using a push model rather than a pull model is a good way for any company,"
"8710880","8715860"," especially Nike who is sort of the creator of the pull model to have some problems."
"8716340","8717200"," That's a lot of story."
"8718760","8723480"," All those examples are traditionally what Nike has excelled in, what has made it better than the"
"8723480","8728040"," competition, the innovation, the channels and the going direct to consumers. "
"8728680","8732640"," The new products and the prices they're able to command for that."
"8733480","8736740"," What do you think has changed internally?"
"8737260","8738340"," Is it a leadership issue?"
"8738580","8739940"," Because John Donahue was on the board."
"8740520","8742000"," He's been running the company for a while. "
"8744220","8751020"," I mean, so when John Donahue took over in 2020, it was great timing."
"8751020","8754840"," He was able to really jumpstart their direct to consumer business."
"8755180","8762980"," But based on our checks, at the same time he really stopped paying as much attention to the multi "
"8762980","8763900","-branded retailers. "
"8764580","8767480"," We thought that getting rid of a bunch of them was a good decision."
"8768180","8771180"," Those ones that were not representing the quality of the Nike brand."
"8771860","8777120"," But in certain categories like the Family Footwear Channel where they downplayed that a lot, they"
"8777120","8778600"," really found they couldn't sell that. "
"8778600","8784000"," And when the consumer came back and started shopping in stores again, he really wasn't ready for"
"8784000","8786080"," that or the company wasn't ready for that."
"8786520","8792860"," And unlike the prior leadership, if you showed Mark Parker or shoe, he'd be able to tell you if he"
"8792860","8794520"," thought that shoe would be good or not."
"8794840","8799060"," And I doubt he was right all the time, but he had a very good instinct for it. "
"8799060","8808780"," And part of the consultant issue that you mentioned is I don't think there's just that instinct"
"8808780","8809740"," for products."
"8809740","8817440"," So they're using a lot of spreadsheets now versus combining the art and the science, which I"
"8817440","8819600"," believe has made them so successful over the years."
"8820860","8822640"," Yeah, I mean, Sam, it's David Shabry. "
"8822740","8825100"," You don't hold back in your report."
"8825160","8827340"," You sort of just encapsulated some of it."
"8827520","8832080"," But you say, you know, many season Nike executives across many parts of the corporation were let"
"8832080","8833120"," go, left the company. "
"8833720","8839920"," And you talk about C-suite leaders lacking the levels of brand and Nike institutional knowledge."
"8840240","8845620"," So that would seem to speak to a problem if you're correct over not just a short term, but a"
"8845620","8846200"," longer term."
"8847100","8850540"," Well, I think we've already seen some of that come out in recent results. "
"8851700","8856960"," And so yes, I mean, we think this is not just me making a call on the quarter."
"8857340","8861320"," We think there's something fundamentally needs to be fixed there."
"8861940","8867420"," And, you know, a lot of the changes were made, a lot of the decisions being made. "
"8867620","8874360"," I mentioned in a note that came out in December that, you know, they hired a woman from Amazon to"
"8874360","8876040"," be their chief technology officer."
"8876040","8881620"," Now, she certainly checks all the boxes to be able to do that job, except for our checks say that"
"8881620","8883200"," she's not a real brand person."
"8883780","8887180"," And I would think that anybody you bring in to Nike better be brand first. "
"8887820","8892380"," Of course, they have to have the correct operational skill set, but, you know, Nike is a brand."
"8893300","8899280"," And if you're putting operational stuff ahead of brand for a company like Nike, there's going to be"
"8899280","8899540"," issues."
"8900800","8907680"," Well, it certainly is notable, especially coming from you, Sam, who I said has been a deep admirer"
"8907680","8910660"," of the company and big fan of the stock for a long time. "
"8910960","8912360"," Sam Poser from Williams, thank you."
"8913200","8917500"," And David, the Nike reports earnings on Thursday, and Sam expects them to cut full-year guidance"
"8917500","8918020"," again."
"8918580","8921780"," They did last quarter, remember, on weaker macro trends. "
"8922720","8923860"," China's going to be really key."
"8924080","8926700"," That's going to come up every time of course, so important to them as well."
"8926900","8927440"," Yeah, big driver. "
"8928220","8934420"," Charles Schwab's chief fixed income strategist on next on the rate cut timeline, and what to do"
"8934420","8936420"," with bonds ahead of Wednesday's big Fed meeting."
"8936740","8937260"," We're back in a few."
"9156740","9157320"," Welcome back. "
"9157480","9160000"," Take a look at yields two-year, ten-year, 30."
"9160220","9161460"," All you can see that."
"9161680","9165780"," That would be right near one month highs as we head, of course, into this week's Fed decision. "
"9165780","9170300"," And when it comes to finding value in the bond market, our next guest is telling investors to"
"9170300","9175200"," consider gradually extending duration and look for opportunities in investment grade."
"9175480","9176940"," Corporate's joining us here at Post 9."
"9177120","9180840"," Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for Charles Schwab."
"9181100","9181780"," Kathy, good to have you. "
"9181900","9183520"," Let's start off with the FOMC meeting."
"9183740","9187740"," I think you've said you're bracing for a potentially hawkish meeting."
"9187760","9188080"," Why?"
"9188600","9194040"," Well, I think what we've seen in the last couple of inflation readings, and some of the economic"
"9194040","9200300"," data, things are not slowing down as much as the market had anticipated, probably as much as the"
"9200300","9204660"," average voter at the FOMC had anticipated. "
"9205360","9211200"," So I don't think they're really going off course or going to reverse course or anything like that,"
"9211300","9217500"," but they just don't have that leeway to be as aggressive and signaling rate cuts as I think they"
"9217500","9218340"," might have been before."
"9218340","9224560"," So we're looking for maybe the dots to indicate two rate cuts this year instead of three."
"9224980","9229760"," You only need two voters to change their estimates for that to happen. "
"9229760","9230640"," So it's a possibility."
"9231580","9236860"," And then we're looking at the summary of economic projections and seeing what the upgrade is to"
"9236860","9239900"," growth, what the upgrade is to inflation at least near term."
"9240440","9242600"," So we've seen Treasury yields move on the back of this. "
"9242780","9244240"," They've been higher in the last few weeks."
"9244900","9247100"," Is the downtrend still intact though?"
"9247100","9248460"," I think so."
"9248640","9253540"," I mean, the overall, we know the direction of travel is lower, right, from the Fed. "
"9253760","9255580"," They're not signaling they're going to raise rates."
"9256300","9261220"," And I think what Paul will probably emphasize in the press conferences, there's still room and a"
"9261220","9265540"," plan to start cutting later as they get more confidence about inflation coming down."
"9265960","9270680"," So even if they're only the terminal rate's only going to be three percent or three and a half"
"9270680","9275480"," percent instead of two and a half, there's still 200 basis points and rate cuts to come. "
"9275680","9277540"," So I think the downtrend is still intact."
"9277860","9282160"," But I think what we'll see in second half of the year is a bull steepening with short-term rates"
"9282160","9283700"," coming down more than long-term rates."
"9284520","9288900"," So where do you think the opportunity is at this point in fixed income with corporates?"
"9289160","9295120"," Yeah, you know, we think that corporate spreads versus Treasury is obviously very low and very"
"9295120","9295740"," tight spreads. "
"9296160","9297980"," On the other hand, they can go lower."
"9297980","9303240"," And if the economy is going to go along okay, if corporations have termed out their debt and are"
"9303240","9309500"," not sitting on, you know, refinancing risk in the near term, at least the investment grade, then"
"9309500","9313920"," locking in a five, five and a half percent yield right here, I think for a lot of people, looks"
"9313920","9314680"," really great."
"9314680","9319620"," Yeah, obviously get a higher yield than that with high yield, but you're a bit concerned there at"
"9319620","9323100"," least in terms of what it might mean if there's a risk-off environment, we just saw that. "
"9323300","9323860"," Yeah, exactly."
"9323860","9328680"," So risk-off is obviously a much bigger risk to high yield."
"9329140","9334600"," Now you're getting a lot of yield, but at this point in the cycle, you know, a lot of these"
"9334600","9339300"," companies do have to refinance in the next year or two, and they will be refinancing at higher"
"9339300","9339660"," rates. "
"9339980","9343820"," So, you know, one of the sayings now is stay alive until 25, right?"
"9344200","9348840"," So there's more risk in high yield, and those spreads are very, very low."
"9348880","9351100"," Are you surprised how well that market's held up so far?"
"9351300","9351860"," Yeah, absolutely."
"9351860","9357660"," We have really been more cautious earlier, and we still are cautious, but I am surprised it's held"
"9357660","9358740"," up as well as it has. "
"9358980","9361620"," People are using the stagflationary word, stagflation."
"9362420","9364700"," Right now, higher inflation, lower growth."
"9365940","9367340"," First of all, do you buy that scenario?"
"9367720","9368380"," Is that what's happening?"
"9368400","9369920"," And if so, what would it mean for bonds?"
"9370400","9371500"," No, I don't think so. "
"9371740","9375600"," I mean, we still have a downtrend in inflation, still a disinflationary trend overall."
"9375940","9378480"," We've gone from 9% CPI to 3% of change."
"9378480","9381260"," So, there's nothing to say that that's not continuing. "
"9381600","9383380"," And actually, growth is doing pretty well."
"9383560","9386300"," We've had a big boom in productivity in the last three or four quarters."
"9386860","9391560"," So, if anything, we're kind of in a very nice spot right now. "
"9391840","9397620"," The question is, you know, how long that continues if that stays tight, but nonetheless, you know,"
"9397640","9398720"," I think we're in a pretty good spot."
"9398940","9401640"," So stagflation doesn't strike me as a realistic outcome."
"9402520","9403320"," Kathy, thank you. "
"9403680","9404480"," Thank you."
"9405120","9411300"," Alphabet, higher today, sharply higher on a report that Apple plans to use Google's Gemini AI for"
"9411300","9412280"," new iPhone features."
"9412600","9415240"," We're going to look at what it could mean for that company, for Alphabet. "
"9415560","9417860"," The stock's seeing its biggest gain since February of last year."
"9632620","9638600"," Market Moving Report today that Apple's in talks with Google to put Google's generative AI Gemini"
"9638600","9640740"," system into its iPhones."
"9641080","9643520"," That is sending shares of both stocks higher today. "
"9643760","9649180"," Deirdre Bosa has some details for us, and certainly I'm sure some context that she always does in"
"9649180","9649720"," her tech check."
"9650380","9651600"," Good morning, David."
"9651840","9657940"," So this is really an AI plot twist, validation for Google, and more doubts around Apple's strategy. "
"9658400","9661060"," Their stock movements over the last month, they really do tell this story."
"9661600","9664680"," Alphabet shares they fell on that botched rollout of Gemini in late Fed."
"9665100","9666640"," They continue to like broader markets. "
"9667120","9671340"," Microsoft, despite some concerns around co-pilot, it's continued to be seen as the lead."
"9671860","9674720"," But look at that tick up on that blue line, which is Google today."
"9675260","9676920"," That's today's report, a shakeup. "
"9676920","9679060"," Google leapfrogs Microsoft with that."
"9679200","9680920"," At one point, it was up 7%."
"9680920","9683500"," A deal to license AI features on the iPhone. "
"9683760","9689260"," It would be a strong rebuke to the bears who worried that Google's Gemini was falling short of"
"9689260","9692720"," competition and that it would have trouble monetizing its AI."
"9693120","9697880"," That current distribution deal with Apple that we talk about often, that has helped cement Google's"
"9697880","9698700"," dominance and search."
"9699220","9703760"," Another AI deal that could give Google a boost in the early innings here. "
"9703760","9708980"," And going back to that chart, Apple you'll see is the yellow line remains at the bottom because"
"9708980","9712080"," it's still seen as last among megacaps in this AI race."
"9712520","9713960"," And this report doesn't help that perception."
"9714400","9719100"," Apple, of course, it's rarely the first mover preferring to perfect a product before releasing it. "
"9719540","9722500"," But anticipation has also been building that Tim Cook and Co."
"9722760","9727000"," would announce something big on the AI front at WWDC in June."
"9727220","9728240"," That's this big developer conference. "
"9728240","9730300"," Of course, guys, only report for now."
"9730580","9734240"," Apple could still quietly be building up that AI strategy behind the scenes."
"9734720","9738620"," We don't have other details like how it would be branded and even who would be paying who?"
"9739040","9741380"," Does Apple need Google more or is it the other way around?"
"9741700","9746800"," But all of this reshuffling over just one month that chart I showed you, it tells us how volatile"
"9746800","9750440"," this race is and how quickly winners and losers are perceived. "
"9751060","9753880"," The next few months will provide plenty more catalyst."
"9753880","9758620"," We've got Google IO, May 14th, Microsoft bill that's only a week later."
"9758780","9764920"," And then, of course, Apple's WWDC in June when many are expecting that big announcement, which"
"9764920","9765900"," could still happen. "
"9765900","9766680"," So we'll see."
"9766760","9768000"," But this is how it's looking today."
"9768540","9769000"," Yeah. "
"9769200","9772820"," And as you point out, Ginger, of course, there's still much we don't know."
"9773100","9775880"," This is just a Bloomberg story at this point."
"9775880","9777460"," Yeah, I assume it's well reported. "
"9777780","9782620"," But again, you know, it certainly possible, isn't it, that in fact Apple could have approached or"
"9782620","9786120"," be in talks with any number of the generative AI providers, so to speak."
"9786940","9791880"," And even perhaps feature all of them in some fashion, you know, on the iPhone."
"9792620","9794140"," And that's been a very good strategy. "
"9794500","9799360"," Take a look at another gen AI company, which is perplexity, right, which was kind of coming up on"
"9799360","9803040"," the scene in terms of this user interface replacing some search capability."
"9803580","9805500"," And it draws on many different models."
"9805660","9808020"," That is possibly what Apple could do here. "
"9808220","9812480"," But in that report today from Bloomberg said that Apple did consider an open AI."
"9812800","9816420"," So it kind of helps with that halo that we're seeing for alphabet shares today."
"9816520","9819880"," The idea that maybe it won out over open AI. "
"9820120","9825440"," But again, so very early on, you bring up a good point, David, that it's not done."
"9825520","9826420"," It's not a done deal."
"9826620","9828320"," We could see more happen here. "
"9828320","9832760"," And my point in showing that month long chart is just how quickly things move in the space."
"9833400","9835740"," All right, Deirdre Bose, thank you very much."
"9835980","9840720"," And if we look at some of these megacap stocks today, it's no wonder the NASDAQ is soaring almost"
"9840720","9841620"," one and a half percent. "
"9841880","9842200"," It's Apple."
"9842880","9843300"," It's Google."
"9843920","9844840"," It's NVIDIA's. "
"9844920","9847060"," It gets set to kick off its developers conference Tesla."
"9847580","9851460"," Having a say, I mentioned earlier that the others are outperforming Tesla's actually jumping more"
"9851460","9853060"," up more than 6%."
"9853060","9856400"," But in terms of contribution to the overall NASDAQ at this point. "
"9856400","9856840"," Right."
"9856900","9862200"," Well, that's like a 530 billion market value is less than half the others, well less than half."
"9862320","9863500"," But it's a good day for all of them. "
"9863660","9867920"," It's actually a broad day rally for the overall S&P 500, which is up a percent."
"9868340","9872380"," Even some of the cyclical groups and even the more defensive ones, which are lagging like utilities"
"9872380","9874100"," are in the green today."
"9874480","9879220"," Spike these higher yields and they are grinding higher into the Fed as now more people are"
"9879220","9881860"," expecting potentially more hawkish tone. "
"9881860","9882580"," Yeah."
"9882660","9887720"," Well, we just heard Kathy Jones say as you've been saying potentially two cuts a set of three"
"9887720","9888540"," perhaps in the dots."
"9888540","9888880"," Yeah. "
"9889000","9890620"," And what he signals in his news conference."
"9891220","9892060"," Always interesting tonight."
"9892080","9893040"," It's going to be Bank of Japan. "
"9893480","9894800"," I know I'm watching it."
"9895000","9895380"," Of course."
"9895500","9896520"," Well, we're talking about it tomorrow. "
"9897020","9897420"," Thank you."
"9897700","9898820"," Love having you here, David."
"9899260","9903200"," That's going to do it for us here on Money Mover's Over to Melissa Lee and the Halftime Report. "
"9906880","9908640"," Welcome to the Halftime Report on Melissa Lee."
"9908640","9913240"," And today for Scott Walkner, the AI trade front and centers and video gears up for local AI"
"9913240","9918320"," developers conference and two tech chitens reportedly in talks to join forces in the AI arms race."
"9918320","9922260"," The investment committee is standing by to break down what all this means for your portfolio"
"9922260","9923340"," joining us this hour. "
"9923540","9926860"," Joe Terranova, Jason Snipe, Steve Weiss and Shannon Sakosha."
"9927180","9931340"," We're going to go alive to San Jose, California in just a few moments ahead of NVIDIA's developers"
"9931340","9931780"," event."
"9932020","9934220"," But first, we do want to start with our chart of the day. "
"9934220","9939980"," Google rocketing higher and reports that Apple is in talks to use Google's Gemini AI engine in the"
"9939980","9940360"," iPhone."
"9941020","9945220"," Take a look at that reaction in the stock of 6% showing some signs of life in the AI"
"9945220","9945600"," trade."
"9946020","9947380"," Joe, what do you make of this?"
"9947480","9953380"," Well, this potentially reignites the MAG 7 concentration out performance because now Alphabet,"
"9953820","9957780"," Apple, they're participating and they had kind of been sitting on the sidelines for an extended"
"9957780","9958780"," period of time. "
"9959380","9961260"," Fundamentally, this is very interesting dynamic."
"9961260","9965420"," I'm not necessarily sure who was going to be paying who in this scenario."
"9966600","9970340"," Obviously, we know that they pay Apple in terms of search. "
"9971080","9974680"," And this is also a little bit puzzling to me for Apple."
"9975140","9981040"," Is this an admission that maybe they couldn't bring forth their own AI, Gen AI strategy fast"
"9981040","9981420"," enough?"
"9981960","9984680"," They're outsourcing it and then the regulatory risk."
"9984880","9987100"," There's regulatory risk for this as well. "
"9987100","9991940"," But clearly, this is a positive, a significant positive for Alphabet."
"9992740","9996080"," And I think it's something that's probably been circulating in the market for the last week as"
"9996080","9998900"," Alphabet's had a remarkably strong bounce over that period."
"9999000","10001380"," Yeah, there is a lot we do not know about the relationship. "
"10001620","10006180"," We only know that they are in talks right now that Apple actually also had talks with OpenAI"
"10006180","10007680"," according to this Bloomberg report."
"10008800","10010400"," And so, Jason, how do you read it?"
"10010540","10013960"," I think it's interesting what Joe said in terms of maybe this is a read through to Apple that they"
"10013960","10015380"," didn't have their AI act together."
"10015380","10020180"," And especially in time for the World Wide Developers Conference in June. "
"10020760","10020820"," Right."
"10021160","10022380"," No, I think that makes sense."
"10022920","10028340"," But in some just to a certain degree, listen, I mean Google is a default search engine for Apple. "
"10029420","10032580"," So, you know, this deal I think makes sense from that standpoint."
"10032860","10034880"," I mean, they've worked together obviously for some time."
"10035440","10040360"," And it's no secret clearly that the Gemini rollout has been not strong. "
"10041040","10044720"," So, I think this is obviously a major positive we're seeing in the price action with Google today."
"10045580","10052980"," Yeah, and to Joe's point, I think it's interesting to see Apple not have developed this on their"
"10052980","10055920"," own, you know, with all the resources they have in the build out."
"10056180","10058380"," But I think it could be a short-term deal. "
"10058600","10059060"," We don't know."
"10059820","10065760"," But I think they can get a lot from this deal and see how it develops over the long term."
"10065760","10067020"," Yeah, why is he on alphabet?"
"10067320","10070800"," Do you think that its AI search engine is fixable?"
"10071000","10072160"," That's why you bought this thing. "
"10072400","10077620"," Does this, I mean, this could open billions of users potentially for its AI search engine."
"10079000","10087300"," Yeah, so that is why I added on the decline based upon the poor launch of their AI tool."
"10087780","10093580"," Look, I mean, the question is, you know, does Apple feel that they're behind and has to outsource"
"10093580","10093800"," it?"
"10093800","10094580"," Guess what?"
"10095240","10096900"," Apple is not an innovator. "
"10097200","10102300"," If you go through any of the tech companies, go through the largest tech companies, Apple has by"
"10102300","10104320"," far the lowest R&D expense."
"10105020","10110760"," It's the R&D expense is about 7% versus meta at 30% and you can look at the"
"10110760","10111960"," others that are at least double."
"10112520","10113920"," So, of course, they're a follower. "
"10114480","10117340"," And of course, they need somebody else to innovate for them."
"10117340","10122480"," And Google, since it already is a partner, is a natural partner and I'll clear up the mystery."
"10123000","10128120"," Apple is going to have to either lower what Google pays them right now, which is like 19 billion a"
"10128120","10133400"," year, or they're going to have to have a separate line where they'll pay Google for using their"
"10133400","10133680"," search. "
"10134340","10136780"," So, to me, it's a great deal for alphabet."
"10137360","10142100"," It is a fixable problem they have, and there are only two companies right now out there."
"10142100","10146960"," Maybe three if you include meta, but it's for their own purpose, that have these search engines"
"10146960","10147940"," that others could use. "
"10148260","10150700"," One being Google, of course, and the other being Microsoft."
"10151500","10153400"," So, yeah, so I think it's a great move."
"10154220","10157200"," They still have to fix their problems, though, Joe. "
"10157560","10159440"," I mean, that's sort of the linear standing issue."
"10159640","10164060"," Even if they are, you know, potentially unlocking billions of potential users, they've got to have"
"10164060","10165420"," a search engine people want to use."
"10165420","10167220"," People view as accurate. "
"10167560","10167900"," Incredible."
"10168260","10172200"," And people want to know that it's a reliable source to them."
"10172580","10176900"," I think clearly the circumstances of the last month kind of call that into question. "
"10177220","10182000"," So, there's a lot there for them to still prove, but look, you wake up on a Monday morning."
"10182000","10185380"," This is almost like when you wake up on a Monday morning and you have a big mega deal."
"10185820","10192340"," That's kind of what this was this morning for the market, and it took the market away from where it"
"10192340","10195320"," was on Friday, which was in a little bit of a tenuous in TV. "
"10195320","10199340"," And it reignited some of that positive momentum."
"10199360","10206300"," And again, I think the single most important from a strategic perspective element of this story is"
"10206300","10209560"," now do we have the MAG-7 outperforming once again."
"10210120","10213440"," That kind of had been that trade, that idea had been resting for the last several weeks. "
"10213640","10215620"," And we do have the laggard Shannon."
"10215880","10216980"," No, no, look, okay."
"10217660","10219640"," Okay, Steve, you want to let it go ahead?"
"10220820","10224360"," I do want to let it actually, because I think it'll be very instructive for you now. "
"10225060","10230660"," Look, we're talking here like Microsoft and OpenAI have flawless products."
"10231160","10232720"," That is so far from the truth."
"10233800","10240320"," The distance they've created in the launch between Alphabet themselves is just not that great and"
"10240320","10241360"," easily transversed. "
"10242120","10245240"," So, that just has to level set the conversation."
"10245980","10247360"," OpenAI just not has perfect products."
"10247700","10248100"," It's fraught. "
"10249280","10250520"," Microsoft is OpenAI."
"10250520","10253480"," Google, Joe, I hope that's our new slide for you."
"10253680","10257840"," No, I just, I didn't hear anyone mention Microsoft in the first five minutes of the show. "
"10258240","10262160"," Anyway, I wanted to ask Shannon what she thought of the markets today in terms of the participation"
"10262160","10264920"," of all of the MAG-7 in today's session."
"10267270","10270630"," Well, I think Joe hit the nail on the head in terms of what the importance is here."
"10270790","10275730"," And I wouldn't be surprised to see a little bit more of a tail on this for Alphabet, Melissa, then"
"10275730","10276770"," perhaps for Apple. "
"10276770","10283750"," The second derivative of this for Apple longer term is that if there's a rationale for users to"
"10283750","10288450"," upgrade handsets in order to access AI technology, that's where you're going to get the lift for"
"10288450","10290390"," Apple from this particular type of deal."
"10290810","10296190"," But I think on the credibility side, Google's really been looking for credibility in terms of the"
"10296190","10304950"," ability for them to show that Gemini can be a strong competitor or substitute for Microsoft's"
"10304950","10305150"," product."
"10305150","10310150"," I think across the market, though, I think one of the things that we've been grappling with over"
"10310150","10315510"," the last several weeks has been this dispersion in the MAG-7, which in our view is a positive"
"10315510","10317590"," because it means that people are looking at fundamentals. "
"10318190","10321450"," It's also afforded the opportunity for some lift in some other sectors."
"10321950","10324870"," But I wouldn't say it's at the expense of the MAG-7."
"10324970","10326070"," It doesn't need to happen. "
"10326610","10328390"," It's not a binary trade, if you will."
"10328530","10332570"," Some of the strength we've seen in energy, in materials, in industrials."
"10332570","10338610"," That feels more as a response to some of the economic data we're getting outside of the US, for"
"10338610","10338810"," instance. "
"10339170","10340510"," I don't think it's a binary trade."
"10340710","10344810"," I think the lift that we see on the MAG-7 certainly helps from the concentration perspective, but I"
"10344810","10347810"," don't think it negates some of the momentum that we've seen in other parts of the market."
"10348610","10349810"," What does this mean for Apple?"
"10350270","10352050"," It's widely anticipated entry into AI. "
"10352310","10354790"," Let's bring in CNBC technology correspondent Steve Colvak."
"10362470","10368090"," In this new upgrade cycle that's coming in the fall, and basically convincing folks that whatever"
"10368090","10373250"," AI features they do announce, Tim Cook says they're going to, and this is quoting him, break new"
"10373250","10374410"," ground in AI."
"10374930","10378730"," We have some kind of hints, I guess, at what Gemini can do. "
"10379270","10383030"," Google had already started putting Gemini in a couple of Android phones, their own Pixel phones."
"10383850","10387970"," Samsung is using Google AI and its latest phones that came out just a couple months ago."
"10387970","10392970"," But right now, what they can do is stuff like live translation between languages. "
"10393710","10397750"," They can take a voice recording and transcribe it natively on your device."
"10398310","10402910"," And also some photo editing tools, like if you circle someone or something and tell it to erase"
"10402910","10404810"," that object in the picture, I can do that."
"10405270","10407750"," Those aren't new or novel use cases for AI. "
"10408070","10410690"," It's not the breakthrough that Tim Cook is maybe teasing."
"10410690","10417850"," So the question becomes, what else can Gemini do for Apple that they can leverage that language"
"10417850","10420050"," model in order to do what they kind of envision."
"10420650","10425910"," And again, like so many folks were just saying here on the panel, it just speaks to Apple's"
"10425910","10430850"," inability so far, if this is true at least, to come up with their own AI model. "
"10431030","10437050"," And that should cause some concern as well because five or six years ago, the company hired a"
"10437050","10439130"," Google executive to run their AI division."
"10439130","10440510"," His name is John Gian Andrea."
"10441090","10446870"," And this is kind of his baby here that he needs to be pushing this AI narrative forward for Apple. "
"10447210","10453590"," And right now, it seems to be more leveraged on the Google side and a rival than it is building"
"10453590","10455590"," in house as we would expect Apple to do."
"10455950","10460310"," If there is a partnership, Steve, what do you think that this will be an Apple branded AI search"
"10460310","10463230"," engine or will it be Gemini on Apple?"
"10463690","10468630"," That is the biggest question because Apple obviously has Siri on the phone."
"10468630","10472290"," It obviously has a lot of AI stuff going on under the hood. "
"10472510","10476750"," But if they all of a sudden need to kind of inject Google technology in there, what does that do?"
"10476930","10479050"," Does that mean it's no longer an Apple product?"
"10479390","10484390"," I mean, I will note, I mean, the best analogy we have right now, Melissa, is the search deal."
"10484550","10489150"," When you go open up your Safari browser on your iPhone and just type in a search term into that"
"10489150","10490970"," bar at the top, that's all Google."
"10491290","10492510"," That is a Google experience. "
"10492950","10495090"," It's not necessarily an Apple experience."
"10495090","10497050"," And that is what Google is paying for."
"10497290","10501590"," And like some other folks here just mentioned, the big question becomes, is Google going to be..."
"10501590","10506450"," Or is Google going to be paying Apple for access to those billions of users for Gemini or is it"
"10506450","10507330"," going to go the other way?"
"10507590","10509810"," And Apple is licensing this from Google. "
"10510150","10511710"," Either way, it's great for Google."
"10512330","10513550"," All right, Steve, thanks."
"10514770","10515210"," Steve Kovac. "
"10516010","10519850"," I'm curious, Jason, what's your take on the up 1.6% for Apple?"
"10519850","10523290"," It doesn't seem like a whole, I mean, I don't know."
"10523530","10524830"," It seems like a kind of response."
"10525330","10525830"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"10525990","10531430"," I think the most important point is, I think it helps with the upgrade cycle going forward."
"10531690","10533530"," You know, like, what is the new news?"
"10533730","10534350"," What is the new catalyst?"
"10534750","10537850"," And all the points are well taken in terms of..."
"10538410","10539950"," They have been slow to innovate."
"10540130","10541090"," I think Weiss made that point. "
"10541630","10543210"," I mean, that's not really their game."
"10543490","10547310"," I think it's all about the integration of other technologies and their user base and the user"
"10547310","10547610"," experience."
"10547610","10549870"," I think that's what makes Apple special. "
"10550590","10555370"," But yeah, it's not getting the lift that maybe someone would have imagined, but I think because"
"10555370","10556710"," this deal is more leveraged to Google."
"10557210","10558430"," And I think that's where the opportunity is."
"10558490","10564090"," I think the interesting thing is, and Steve mentioned the lack of innovation at Apple, the bigger"
"10564090","10570970"," question is, Apple scrapped the electric vehicle mission, which was billions of dollars a year. "
"10570970","10572930"," What do they do with all that cash?"
"10573170","10579410"," If they're not paying alphabet for the AI, what are they going to do with all the success of cash?"
"10579670","10583550"," So Steve's actually onto something a little bit, not so much in terms of the innovation, but"
"10583550","10584770"," they're sitting on all this cash."
"10585230","10588690"," At a certain point, the market punishes you for sitting on all that cash."
"10588930","10589530"," Do they do an acquisition?"
"10590530","10591430"," What ultimately is..."
"10591430","10592210"," What are they going to do?"
"10592490","10594870"," They just can't sit there and continue to buy back stock. "
"10595090","10595970"," That's not enough for the market."
"10595970","10597630"," And their hands are tied when it comes to an acquisition."
"10598030","10602430"," I mean, the regulatory forces are hard at work at this point against acquisitions and tech. "
"10603490","10606750"," All right, the other big story we're watching is NVIDIA, the company about to kick off its"
"10606750","10607550"," developers conference."
"10607870","10612350"," Christina Parks and Evelos, they are live in San Jose with what we can expect from CEO Jensen Fong"
"10612350","10614650"," in just a matter of hours."
"10615230","10616630"," Christina, the bar is high here. "
"10618110","10619570"," Oh, incredibly high."
"10619710","10623470"," And we saw that with the stock rise in NVIDIA shares, but this is a developers conference."
"10623470","10629510"," And they are going to want to hear first and foremost about the latest products, specifically specs"
"10629510","10636090"," of its latest AI GPU, how much memory will it have, how does it compare with AMD's latest chip, and"
"10636090","10637190"," its price point. "
"10637490","10642390"," We're expecting maybe about 30% higher than the H100, and this is, I'm talking about the new"
"10642390","10643070"," Blackwell chip."
"10643350","10647850"," So we'll want to know a little bit also as well, details about going beyond GPUs to include"
"10647850","10652110"," ethernet cables, storage, and just that entire ecosystem."
"10652110","10653610"," Software as well. "
"10653970","10659090"," Jensen Wong is giving a two-hour keynote, something we haven't really seen, you know, he's done"
"10659090","10662330"," this in the past, but the fact that 11,000 people are going to be coming to this big arena"
"10662330","10664790"," behind me is something new that we haven't seen in the last five years."
"10665150","10671210"," We should hear more details about partnerships, maybe some celeb CEO appearances, and examples."
"10671690","10673170"," Micron's earnings are out on Wednesday. "
"10673410","10678410"," They've alluded to a collaboration with NVIDIA, the same for Oracle, the same for Broadcom."
"10678410","10684230"," TSMC makes NVIDIA's chips, so we could hear more about those, that relationship, and see the impact"
"10684230","10689610"," on some of these shares, like Super Micro, ARM, you can see up 2% just today."
"10689930","10694770"," Lastly, the theme, demand sustainability, invisibility into 2025 and beyond. "
"10695430","10701070"," Will inferencing be the next major driver for growth now that many large language models are"
"10701070","10706170"," trained, and how will that expansion into other sectors continue to grow, like finance, healthcare,"
"10706970","10708390"," government, sovereign wealth."
"10709010","10714110"," And if Jensen Wong continues to speak about that, that could help show that the pace of growth is"
"10714110","10714770"," going to continue."
"10714930","10719310"," And much of these points to become full circle, Melissa, are priced into this stock. "
"10719690","10722810"," The share price has gone 82% higher in the last three months."
"10722950","10726630"," There's been a lot of volatility just within the last week and a half or so."
"10726890","10731950"," It was down four out of the five sessions just last week, but it's the total addressable market,"
"10732050","10736710"," the TAM, which Jensen said would grow from one to two trillion dollars in the next five years. "
"10736710","10743450"," So any type of details on what that means per year for them could reinforce this AI trade and"
"10743450","10749670"," provide confidence in demand sustainability beyond 2025, which is going to be a key theme here."
"10749790","10753610"," In other words, the best of the AI golden age has yet to come."
"10753770","10755710"," Or as Jensen Wong has said, we're still in the early innings. "
"10756590","10757970"," Right, same thing, right?"
"10758610","10763190"," Christina, though, when you talk about the total addressable market number, it's staggering, but"
"10763190","10764710"," does that also include software?"
"10765570","10769070"," Because this is a developer's conference, and Vidya has to convince people, right?"
"10769230","10773690"," That if they're not just going to be swinging GPUs, it's a whole software ecosystem that they also"
"10773690","10777290"," offer that will be a barrier to entry for others like an AMD."
"10777690","10783090"," I mean, AMD has made some progress with their own software, but not as far along, nearly as NVIDIA."
"10784950","10794530"," Precisely, so NVIDIA offers CUDA, so that's a big selling point. "
"10794530","10796270"," I mean, it's a big selling point to any other type of software ecosystem."
"10797390","10802010"," But for that total addressable market, that $2 trillion, it encompasses not just software and not"
"10802010","10807410"," just GPUs, but you also have the CPUs, the ethernets, you know, the entire data center"
"10807410","10808230"," infrastructure."
"10808670","10813230"," They believe that every infrastructure out there, the data centers, are going to need to be"
"10813230","10819450"," revamped to be able to accommodate the processing for AI, and so that's why that number is so high"
"10819450","10821270"," and can go from one to $2 trillion. "
"10821750","10826230"," For here today, I think what would swing the stock is if we start to hear a number per year."
"10826510","10832890"," So if it's, you know, $500 billion per year for them, then that's going to be a big mover and"
"10832890","10836950"," also reinforce that trade that, hey, okay, AI is sustainable."
"10837470","10840830"," It's not going to be just a blip in the short-term thing. "
"10841070","10844850"," Fixed costs are going to be high right now, and then it's going to diminish in the next two years."
"10844890","10847190"," So that's something we need to hear from him today."
"10847190","10847910"," All right. "
"10848050","10848750"," Christina, thanks."
"10848830","10849910"," Christina Parks and Evelous."
"10850310","10854270"," And do not miss NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, and a CNBC exclusive interview with Jim Kramer. "
"10854590","10857670"," That's tomorrow 10, 15 a.m. Eastern time."
"10858290","10862010"," Joe, you're noting that, you know, we should watch the stock very closely, considering the key"
"10862010","10863750"," reversal that it showed last week."
"10864070","10870090"," So on Friday, March 8th, you had that significant reversal from 974, the stock tumbled down to 874. "
"10871450","10876430"," Something somewhat similar this morning, 946, the stock was up at 924."
"10877030","10885210"," It's now falling back below 900, got down to a low of 878.37. The point is, is the importance"
"10885210","10886530"," of NVIDIA on the market."
"10886870","10892790"," So as NVIDIA had that little bit of a roll over this morning, you saw the market pull back with"
"10892790","10892970"," it. "
"10893250","10894970"," NVIDIA still is the center of the universe."
"10895550","10898270"," As goes NVIDIA will go the market."
"10898270","10904750"," And it's interesting because Jensen Huang probably has more impact on the market than Jay Powell"
"10904750","10910230"," does this week, if you think about it, which is really a remarkable condition. "
"10910230","10916450"," But it also speaks towards that the market is able to overcome some of the friction and inflation"
"10916450","10921910"," and the treasury market because it sees the opportunity and the revenue growth in the AI story."
"10921910","10931310"," And the impact on tech, but semiconductors, since the launch of chat GPT last year, early part of"
"10931310","10934630"," 2023, semiconductors have outperformed the S&P 500."
"10935070","10938650"," It has ignited this trade here that the market has been so dependent on. "
"10938970","10939430"," 100%."
"10939430","10943010"," And I think we run out of adjectives of superlatives for NVIDIA."
"10944290","10947910"," When I think about data center growth, it's quadrupled year over year. "
"10947910","10949310"," And I'm interested to see what this is coming."
"10949570","10954650"," Christina went over a lot of potential discussion points for today."
"10954830","10958010"," And I think, for me, it's continued partnerships. "
"10958450","10960750"," But the big question for me is what is the pull forward?"
"10961050","10963630"," How much have we pulled forward already in terms of growth?"
"10964070","10965550"," Are we going into 2026?"
"10967730","10970890"," Because we know what the price action has been over the last year and a half."
"10971370","10975450"," But that will be a question because we have seen boom bust cycles in the semiconductor space"
"10975450","10975850"," before."
"10975850","10979250"," I don't think anyone would debate what's going on in the short term. "
"10979670","10982230"," But how much have we priced it and how much have we pulled forward?"
"10982450","10984150"," Steve, you have a small position in NVIDIA."
"10984350","10985950"," What concerns you about the stock, if anything?"
"10988090","10993030"," Well, the valuation, I think they'll grow into it in terms of what we saw today."
"10993330","10999290"," The stock was up 35 points at one point, which is not tremendous when you consider what bases are"
"10999290","11000390"," operating off of. "
"11000390","11002690"," But there's a lot of expectation on this speech."
"11002990","11004130"," It's going to be more the same."
"11004290","11005610"," I'm not saying that in a bad way. "
"11005890","11010430"," It's going to be that NVIDIA is the leader, that NVIDIA has new products coming out, and that"
"11010430","11011810"," NVIDIA is going to raise prices."
"11012390","11014090"," So I think everything's fine for now."
"11014510","11016370"," I just wouldn't get excited about two-hour speech. "
"11016970","11020950"," If I were there, I'd probably fall asleep during it because I fall asleep during two-hour movies."
"11021710","11029910"," But here's what I'd say that every large tech company, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, are very"
"11029910","11032810"," incentivized to build their own chips, and they will."
"11033110","11036950"," And they'll do it through ASML using their tools in Taiwan Sunday. "
"11037570","11039150"," So competition is coming."
"11039530","11044270"," However, offsetting that is that you've got such exponential growth in AI."
"11044730","11046270"," This is truly industrial revolution. "
"11046690","11050690"," So I think there'll be multiple winners, but I would not dip down away from large-cap companies"
"11050690","11053230"," because they've got the balance sheets to drive that growth."
"11053690","11053970"," Yeah."
"11054190","11055870"," I mean, the ripple affection in our immense. "
"11055870","11057510"," Wedbush had an interesting note out."
"11057570","11062890"," I think it was today or Friday saying that for every dollar spent on the H100 chip, there's $10 to"
"11062890","11067490"," $12 in enterprise spending on the back of that to support that chip."
"11067690","11069490"," So it's not just the chips. "
"11070330","11073510"," It's the whole array of goods that Christina has sort of gone through."
"11073830","11076370"," The ethernet, the software, et cetera."
"11078070","11082670"," Well, I think the concern is to Melissa, if you think about when people are talking about"
"11082670","11088870"," valuation, what they're concerned about is this shorter-term overestimation of the impact and"
"11088870","11089970"," monetization of AI. "
"11090490","11095570"," But longer-term, there's likely an underestimation in terms of not only revenue growth that can be"
"11095570","11099470"," derived directly from AI, but productivity, enhancement, and improvement."
"11100030","11103850"," And so if you think about it from a longer-term perspective, what you're really hoping for from a"
"11103850","11110750"," market is that we are still cresting that first wave and we don't hit that inflection point where"
"11110750","11116370"," there starts to be perhaps disappointment in what's happening on the enablers from an AI"
"11116370","11116810"," perspective."
"11117350","11120910"," And we start to see that monetization come through on those ripple effects. "
"11121170","11123010"," So that's really what the concern is."
"11123170","11126770"," This shorter-term concern that we don't see the pick up on the second wave."
"11127130","11133050"," But longer-term, there's a lot of analysts who are likely underestimating the longer-term impacts"
"11133050","11138810"," and the fact that they might be able to actually offset some of these higher structural costs that"
"11138810","11140370"," we're likely to see over the next few years. "
"11140710","11142350"," This is an open question for everyone."
"11142770","11143850"," I'm thinking of this."
"11143990","11146890"," Look, there's blue skies for the semiconductor industry. "
"11147450","11151310"," Clearly, it is the strongest industry in the economy right now."
"11151430","11157550"," But at what point does the market potentially price in election risk for the semiconductor"
"11157550","11158250"," industry?"
"11158450","11165230"," Is there election risk surrounding the supply chain for semiconductors getting weaponized if, in"
"11165230","11170490"," fact, the election were to go a certain direction and we see an elevation in tensions surrounding"
"11170490","11171090"," tariffs."
"11171470","11176330"," Do you think that the markets don't see that potential risk even sitting here now, months and"
"11176330","11177390"," months and months before the election?"
"11177590","11182210"," Do you think that for some reason it gets worse once a new administration is elected?"
"11182650","11183570"," It's a great question. "
"11184030","11185590"," It's clearly not priced in."
"11185890","11190150"," Maybe if I could see it, everyone else can see the same thing and they're not concerned about it."
"11190150","11193230"," But I just wonder if it's not a real dynamic. "
"11193230","11194610"," What sort of risk are you worried about, Joe?"
"11195550","11200110"," Joe, specifically, what sort of risk are you worried about specifically?"
"11200870","11206690"," Well, does the supply chain get weaponized in response to an elevated environment where we start"
"11206690","11207750"," talking about tariffs?"
"11208490","11211890"," So maybe TSM gets cut off in terms of being a supplier?"
"11212730","11214970"," No, TSM is a Taiwanese company."
"11215210","11216230"," We're looking to support Taiwan."
"11217330","11220250"," China is a net buyer of semiconductor chips. "
"11221030","11227230"," So if the weaponization to date has been limiting the technology that China could buy, I'm not"
"11227230","11228230"," worried about it at all."
"11229270","11234750"," What may be a worry, but I don't think it should be, is cutting back on the funding that we've"
"11234750","11240090"," seen so far for building the chip plants in the U.S. Because that was bipartisan, very clearly"
"11240090","11240490"," bipartisan."
"11240490","11245710"," So I don't see any weaponization of that, other than potentially being positive. "
"11246810","11247190"," Janet?"
"11248850","11251850"," No, I would say I'm not as worried."
"11252010","11254710"," I'm certainly not worried about what Steve and Steve."
"11254770","11259710"," I don't think Steve's reasonably worried about that either in terms of the pulling back on chip"
"11259710","11260090"," security. "
"11260450","11267470"," I think fiscal spend on security in general and thinking about some of the political aspects of"
"11267470","11267610"," this."
"11267610","11274810"," I think on Joe's point, I think more about just look at what we've seen from a supply shock"
"11274810","11276690"," perspective over the last few years."
"11277270","11284730"," The impact of supply shocks in general, I think, is much more known and a reasonable concern for"
"11284730","11285730"," investors at this point. "
"11285870","11288910"," It's something that feels much more uncontrollable."
"11289190","11294190"," And if you will, less able to forecast than changes on the demand side."
"11294190","11297890"," So I think what we're seeing with shipping, I think that there could be some political concerns as"
"11297890","11298710"," it relates to chips. "
"11299210","11301330"," All of those are impacting costs."
"11301970","11307250"," And I think from my perspective, if you look at supply shocks versus demand shocks, supply shocks"
"11307250","11312250"," just feel much harder to forecast in this next couple of years."
"11313270","11317950"," Well, speaking of the AI trade, Goldman Sachs is a list of AI names that might not be on your"
"11317950","11318210"," radar. "
"11318210","11323370"," You can check out that story right now, CNBC Proke, scan the QR code or go to cmdc.com slash"

"11324470","11328990"," Coming up, our calls of the day, we will hit the trades on Netflix, FedEx, inverter, and more."
"11329290","11330450"," Halftime reported back in two. "
"11333770","11336270"," Are you following the Halftime Report podcast?"
"11336870","11337910"," What are you waiting for?"
"11338610","11340510"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."

"11493990","11495030"," We'll download the app. "
"11509870","11510570"," Welcome back."
"11510730","11515650"," Let's hear calls of the day starting with Netflix, a loop hiking its price target to 700, from 585"
"11515650","11517590"," saying Netflix remains the streaming leader."
"11517890","11520350"," Share is actually hitting a new 52 week high in today's session. "
"11520930","11521910"," Why should you own this one?"
"11523990","11526250"," Yeah, look, I mean, they are the winner."
"11526710","11527810"," Just pure and simple."
"11528150","11531730"," They've been out at the longest and they'll continue to be the winner. "
"11532250","11533430"," It's a small position for me."
"11533430","11535930"," I bought it in one of the days that the stock was dislocated."
"11536370","11538270"," Obviously, I wish I bought more because it's done well. "
"11538690","11539830"," But it's also not cheap."
"11540090","11543290"," And there's only such a large, you know, multiple."
"11543530","11544350"," I'm willing to pay for anything. "
"11545990","11550230"," Their strategy on sports, Jason, is really interesting in terms of creating the sports events, not"
"11550230","11552370"," getting into the bidding wars, not doing it in a costly way."
"11552690","11552890"," Yeah."
"11553570","11554730"," And that really might tie. "
"11554950","11557510"," I mean, Weiss will probably fall asleep during it because it's more than an hour."
"11558970","11559570"," But that's good."
"11559570","11561790"," Mike Tyson fight is going to be an interesting one. "
"11563310","11566450"," No, I think I think Netflix has been an amazing winner here."
"11566650","11569250"," I mean, two Weiss's point in credit."
"11569270","11570870"," I think it has been the undisputed winner. "
"11571370","11575490"," You know, their foray into live sports is obviously a big deal."
"11575570","11576650"," The WWE deal."
"11576950","11579070"," You know, we'll see what happens with this Mike Tyson story. "
"11579190","11579950"," You know, fight."
"11580110","11582950"," I think that'll be fun, but clearly paid sharing margin expansion."
"11582950","11583890"," I like this. "
"11584050","11589290"," Next up is FedEx Barclays reiterating its overweight rating ahead of earnings this Thursday."
"11590630","11593570"," Shannon, you think it's all going to be all about execution at this point?"
"11595670","11601950"," Well, I mean, I think a lot of emphasis has been placed, you know, from 2020 to 2023 on shifting"
"11601950","11610170"," goods volumes and how much the post pandemic world would really rely more on goods or services or"
"11610170","11610850"," that switch back."
"11611090","11617590"," And I think if you look at the cost that FedEx needs to be concerned about, it's, you know,"
"11617750","11622190"," increased shipping rates and obviously what they have to pay for jet fuel. "
"11622430","11626170"," And with, you know, the recent sort of tick up on the energy price side, certainly not anything"
"11626170","11631270"," overly concerning, particularly if they've they've hedged out appropriately at some of the lower"
"11631270","11631690"," prices."
"11632090","11638450"," But I think on the on the execution side, whether it's FedEx or UPS, analysts are really looking"
"11638450","11643170"," for them to keep their costs under control to have a better sense of the volumes that are coming in"
"11643170","11645930"," and really look to be as."
"11647350","11649930"," Ruthlessly cost efficient as possible. "
"11650290","11652210"," And that's where it really comes down to execution."
"11652550","11652750"," All right."
"11652950","11653950"," Let's get to Darden restaurant. "
"11654170","11657250"," Bank of America increasing its price target to 198 and 193."
"11657690","11658950"," Darden also reports on Thursday."
"11659510","11660250"," This is one of your stocks. "
"11660590","11661990"," Stock is near and all time high."
"11662150","11663330"," This is not my favorite name."
"11663630","11667610"," Obviously in consumer discretionary for casual dining a quick serve. "
"11668170","11670330"," I would go to Chipotle as the favorite name."
"11670770","11673310"," But you have to acknowledge Darden has traded remarkably well."
"11673310","11675310"," It will report on Thursday. "
"11675790","11681530"," I think what the street sees is that 2024, they're going to have much better comps to work against"
"11681530","11684630"," store traffic down slightly in the prior month."
"11684970","11686170"," That's priced in already."
"11686310","11691230"," I think you're going to get a good report from Darden on Thursday, which will take the stock above"
"11691230","11691970"," the all time high. "
"11692150","11692510"," All right."
"11692650","11693970"," And finally, let's get to vertive."
"11694070","11695790"," That's stock hitting a new all time high. "
"11696070","11697970"," Bank of America boosting its target to 90."
"11698550","11700430"," Why is you say you love this one?"
"11700490","11701570"," This is an interesting site."
"11701770","11702610"," Cools data centers?"
"11704270","11704970"," Yeah, yeah. "
"11705190","11707190"," And Mel, it's getting kind of boring."
"11707190","11709150"," You come to me full of winners in my portfolio."
"11709570","11711670"," But I'll play along and talk about this one. "
"11712170","11715450"," Yeah, vertive has a has a unique product somewhat unique."
"11715450","11717590"," Others make it, of course, but they are the leader."
"11718050","11719870"," Data centers run very hot. "
"11719970","11721990"," So you got to continue to cool the servers."
"11722070","11724930"," They sell the server, the cooling racks for the servers."
"11724930","11731130"," And when, as I've said before in this show, AI searches take as much as 20 times the power of"
"11731130","11732250"," a simple Google search. "
"11732750","11738910"," AI data centers are multiple levels, three levels versus regular ones being one level."
"11739410","11741370"," So the future for this company is very bright."
"11741570","11745330"," It's growing earnings in the mid 20% level and EBITDA as well. "
"11745610","11746590"," So it's pretty attractive."
"11746790","11749870"," It looks expensive on historical standards."
"11749870","11756650"," But it is a new generation in terms of what they're able to sell their cooling racks for. "
"11756850","11760470"," By the way, Steve, we're going to dedicate the back half of the show to your loser."
"11760730","11762210"," So just get ready for them."
"11762490","11763310"," Let's get to the headline. "
"11763310","11765430"," It's going to be a very short fact portion."
"11765830","11767090"," I think we'll be able to fill 30 minutes."
"11767450","11769030"," Let's get to the headlines with Kate Rooney, Kate. "
"11770310","11775270"," President Biden will sign an executive order today that expands research on women's healthcare."
"11775890","11778570"," It's going to be a very short fact portion."
"11778570","11780130"," I think we'll be able to fill 30 minutes. "
"11780470","11782090"," Let's get to the headlines with Kate Rooney, Kate."
"11783330","11788950"," President Biden will sign an executive order today that expands research on women's healthcare and"
"11788950","11792550"," will announce more than 20 commitments by various federal agencies."
"11792950","11797750"," The executive action follows the $100 million in funding for women's health announced last month by"
"11797750","11798310"," the first leading. "

"13689490","13695110"," aristocrats to position in from here let's bring in David bonsen he's an investment officer at the"
"13695110","13700830"," bonsen group David good to see you so I guess my worry would be if we're talking dividend growth"
"13700830","13707830"," you miss out on a lot of young software names that intentional it is for us I mean we really"
"13707830","13713850"," believe that cash flow is king and we think that the dividend growers through time and their"
"13713850","13720370"," avoidance of a lot of the bursted bubbles that happen with the alternative end up doing far better"
"13720370","13727090"," and we have tons of track record to prove that but I think that ultimately right now people have"
"13727090","13733890"," actually gotten away with this recovery trade since the 2022 meltdown there's been some names that"
"13733890","13738630"," have come back quite a bit now you see some of them I mean I think Tesla's down over 50"
"13738630","13745450"," percent and and Apple isn't double digits down all the while NVIDIA is still just climbing"
"13745450","13752850"," vociferously those things don't tend to end well but at the same time if you believe that this AI"
"13752850","13757910"," thing isn't just a flash in the pan it's not the metaverse you know it's not blockchain necessarily"
"13757910","13762690"," that really it's going to change the way business happens shouldn't you allocate some portion of"
"13762690","13769430"," your portfolio to names that you think have some sustainable advantage there yeah but I would"
"13769430","13775110"," recommend doing it at something isn't trading at 50 times forward earnings or assuming that margins"
"13775830","13781790"," will hold when revenue is up 10 times from what it is now margins don't hold with that kind of"
"13781790","13788210"," revenue growth and so for example there's a dividend-growing name called Broadcom that we own it's"
"13788210","13794650"," gotten expensive we have a lower waiting but we've owned it for years now it's very exposed to AI"
"13794650","13801350"," IBM is exposed to AI Texas Instruments these are dividend-growing names that have real cash flows"
"13801350","13807910"," that don't require you to buy into something that's up you know 250 percent in the blink of an eye"
"13807910","13813350"," that's what I'm concerned about is the momentum chasing outside of tech you also like Amgen Johnson"
"13813350","13822870"," and Johnson and Medstream energy ETF pick one of those for me and tell me why well I picked the"
"13822870","13826570"," Johnson Johnson and Amgen because I wanted to be as boring as I could when we're talking about"
"13826570","13832110"," NVIDIA you're talking about Johnson Johnson trade growing a dividend for 65 years in a row it"
"13832110","13837490"," doesn't get anyone excited but you know the beta is less than half of that of the market it may"
"13837490","13844070"," be time for us to get back into more low beta very dependable cash flow growth Amgen has grown the"
"13844070","13851170"," dividend double digits for over 10 years per year I mean that's massive internal growth these"
"13851170","13856230"," biotech names have become great dividend growers midstream energy it's just absolutely a phenomenal"
"13856230","13863490"," high income high growth of income story do you think about international in this environment I'm"
"13863490","13868570"," looking at some of these India ETFs looking at the growth of the youth population the big"
"13868570","13875450"," nationwide adoption of digital and payments technology and wondering it's had quite a run too but"
"13875450","13883350"," the demographics don't seem to be slowing down yeah we view that international story is something"
"13883350","13888490"," that takes a real macro look meaning is the best way to international exposure companies that are"
"13888490","13894430"," based there or companies that are perhaps based in the US US accounting US governance US maturity"
"13894430","13901170"," and sophistication with capital markets but nevertheless 50-60 percent of sales coming from these"
"13901170","13907710"," markets so there's a very global story with a lot of US based companies India is doing great"
"13907710","13913710"," locally but you have to translate that to a bottom up story you can't go buy an ETF for Minnesota"
"13914250","13920310"," you can't buy an ETF for Texas but there are companies in Minnesota companies in Texas we view it"
"13920310","13926710"," the same way with international markets okay so back to your your your call here that you got to"
"13926710","13933330"," avoid investing strategies that simply buy the stocks that go up are you at all betting that stocks"
"13933330","13938090"," are going to go down and is there a thought about what is going to be the catalyst that dries"
"13938090","13943890"," that moment for the markets yeah no we're not betting anything I don't want to bet against the"
"13943890","13949610"," market going higher because the video can go up multiples from here yeah um I just know how it ends"

"13981730","13988130"," the problem it was just too expensive I'm a child of the late 90s I grew up professionally managing"
"13988130","13993550"," money there I see in NVIDIA some of the same risks that played out there John that's the story for"
"13993550","14000910"," us all right David bonsen I appreciate you joining us here on the exchange let's talk energy now"
"14000910","14006610"," oil prices up about 1% with Brent crude hitting the 86 dollar mark for the first time since"

"14031370","14037470"," joining us I want to combine two things that we just talked about on CNBC it's in video they've got"
"14037470","14041990"," this huge conference today as well Jim Kramer is going to be sitting down with the CEO and I bring"
"14041990","14049090"," NVIDIA up because AI is everything and all I ever hear is that AI is going to drive all this"
"14049090","14055850"," demand for electricity we get most of our electricity from natural gas you happen to produce and"
"14055850","14063450"," sell a lot of natural gas is there an AI discussion to be had around shell or am I just"
"14063450","14068970"," completely out of my mind no I think there is definitely a big discussion to be had about just"
"14068970","14074890"," energy demand growth in general whether that's crypto related AI related or the multiple other"
"14074890","14082030"," realities around just population growth in countries like China and beyond and so around the world"
"14082030","14088130"," so what you currently have is a significant pull on more and more electricity that's coming in as"
"14088130","14093050"," well as energy in totality companies like shell as you rightly said indeed are the biggest players"
"14093050","14098730"," in LNG but we also have a lot of domestic gas production which we also sell into the grid I"
"14098730","14103590"," think we are going to have a bigger and bigger role both in terms of supplying that energy but of"
"14103590","14108750"," course also using a lot of the AI ourselves given we still work on things like the subsurface in"
"14108750","14113310"," the Gulf of Mexico those are all great opportunities to be able to become much more productive in"
"14113310","14117070"," the way we work yeah because when I think about energy and that's what we're talking about here is"
"14117070","14121550"," energy okay this oil and gas but we're talking about the need for this and 10 years ago is up"
"14121550","14126470"," all about the transition now we're talking about energy scarcity energy security we want to build"
"14126470","14130970"," all these data centers we want to make sure people have light and heat and places like India and"
"14130970","14137170"," these other developing markets when I look at your LNG shells LNG forecast you see 50 percent"
"14137170","14143590"," growth over the next 15 years where's that coming from three key areas that point to one is"
"14143590","14151330"," continued growth in LNG that is substituting out coal that plays out in areas like India areas like"
"14151330","14156830"," China and beyond secondly you have a few countries many countries actually that have the"
"14156830","14162890"," infrastructure for gas because they depended on domestic gas production with time they no longer"
"14162890","14169090"," have those those resources so they're having to import LNG to be able to use the infrastructure to"
"14169090","14174090"," keep powers in the home and then thirdly it's energy security the realities of what happened in"
"14174090","14179410"," Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that now we need to be able to bring LNG from afar"
"14179970","14185370"," those three key drivers are critical ingredients to be able to see that 50 percent bump up in LNG"
"14185370","14192330"," between now and 24th you're a global company you before this as the CEO you ran the LNG business"
"14192330","14199870"," and Qatar and worldwide in the middle east we just announced a pause in US LNG exports now we're"
"14199870","14204610"," still planning to double those exports with the projects that are currently underway from Shell's"
"14204610","14212250"," perch is that going to hurt the US's competitiveness in supplying the world with LNG I think in the"
"14212250","14217350"," short to medium term there isn't a specific issue to be worried about longer term there might be"
"14217350","14222870"," depending on where the polls goes these are 20-year projects exactly so it's not a short medium"
"14222870","14229750"," term issue my bigger concern however is that LNG from the US and LNG from Qatar those are the two"
"14229750","14236510"," biggest sources of LNG anything that undermines confidence in those supplies will always create"
"14236510","14242630"," some nervousness in the markets and therefore what I worry more about is the softer elements of the"
"14242630","14248970"," polls to a market that I think meets confidence and comfort into the long term and not just in the"
"14248970","14255250"," short and medium term and so we hope that this gets resolved over the coming months into giving the"
"14255250","14259470"," sort of clarity that I think the market will value much value you know it's funny people that don't"
"14259470","14263610"," come to this conference they see okay oil and gas now there's a lot of renewables we're"
"14263610","14268450"," interviewing next era for tonight as well they don't realize that the climate and climate change is"
"14268450","14272830"," a huge topic to discussion here people think oh you just ignore it no no it's a massive topic I"
"14272830","14278730"," read a headline in a CNBC you might have heard of CNBC that Shell had just recently watered down"
"14278730","14285470"," your climate goals going from 15 to 20 percent from a hard 20 have you watered them down now we"
"14285470","14290070"," have it so I think we have been very clear we are committed to the 2050 target of med zero"
"14290620","14296890"," what we have said is in 2030 we have a package of targets and ambitions that allow us to be"
"14296890","14301410"," able to both monitor the pace of our progress and allow our shareholders to know what we're doing"
"14301410","14305970"," what we have done on the net carbon intensity the one where we have moved from 20 to 15 to"
"14305970","14312970"," 20 percent is we have said strategically we are shifting from selling power to homes an area we"
"14312970","14318770"," have tried to do but haven't been successful in and we've sold out of in particular in Europe so we"
"14318770","14324070"," are reducing the growth in the power sales we had anticipated which is why we are part course"
"14324070","14331810"," correcting we also by the way added a new ambition an ambition to reduce the emissions from our oil"
"14331810","14338650"," product sales over the next six years by 2030 so you're still committed net zero 2050 very much so"
"14338650","14343650"," with with interim targets to allow us to get there but we're going to do it in a way that"
"14343650","14348570"," focuses on the areas where we have competitive strengths and we're going to make sure that we are"
"14348570","14353710"," focused and not betting too many different plays focus on the four or five where we think we have a"
"14353710","14359710"," differentiated ability I had the pleasure of going on your hydro huge hydrogen facility in"
"14359710","14364950"," Rotterdam the Netherlands which is just unbelievable by the way hydrogen is a huge not always at a"
"14364950","14369730"," big topic while it's also a little bit of a controversial topic a lot of people say it'll never be"
"14369730","14374690"," economic it'll never work other people say it's the future right we've got the inflation reduction"
"14374690","14380290"," act I'm not going to ask you to dive into US politics what is the role of hydrogen in the"
"14380290","14385610"," United States is there a role of hydrogen in the United States I think firstly there's a massive"
"14385610","14391430"," footprint already of hydrogen today in the US albeit grey hydrogen and that will over time meet the"
"14391430","14396910"," get decarbonized and to either we call blue hydrogen or green hydrogen let's say cleaner hydrogen"
"14397510","14403050"," so that role is going to continue to be there I think there's a lot of views that try to"
"14403050","14408170"," polarize the discussion between is there or isn't there a role the reality is the role will grow"
"14408170","14414310"," yep over time the more we have green power the more we have solar and renewables wind as well the"
"14414310","14419770"," more you're going to have access to available electrons which one day can feed into an electrolyzer"
"14419770","14424850"," that produces the hydrogen so I don't think it's a question of is hydrogen going to play a role the"
"14424850","14430950"," question is when will clean hydrogen start to become material I think the answer is more 2030s if"
"14430950","14437010"," not 2040s 2030s if not 2040s but it's being invested in I know billions by you guys as well I"

"14731070","14736290"," don't exactly know how this is going to roll out maybe apple is leaning on google's gemini while it"

"14741410","14746470"," don't know but i agree with you i think a lot of folks here especially in san francisco don't think"

"14756970","14763410"," where now the features are pretty competitive if they do build gemini into the iphone apple still"
"14763410","14767910"," gets a lot of data on exactly how people are using it one kinds of queries they're putting through"
"14767910","14774210"," it could help them build their own while they're getting paid by google could it not exactly and i"
"14774210","14778730"," think that's what i'm hearing as well is that maybe this is sort of a temporary solution jim kramer"

"15971880","15977000"," capitulated and written down their equity of zero they've effectively handed the keys to the lender"
"15977000","15981600"," but it hasn't treated yet so i think they're because the lender isn't ready to take the discount so"
"15981600","15985720"," i think there's a fair amount of of that going on so it's taking a little longer right it's like"
"15985720","15989720"," when you got a stock that's way underwater you only lose money really when you sell it exactly so"
"15989720","15993300"," you try to avoid that for as long as possible quickly is there a triggering moment that you think"

"16024820","16031480"," i think when they see the opportunity set to lend more that's actually going to motivate them to"

"16421590","16427810"," amount of business and there's going to be a lot more usage than there is training right right"
"16427810","16432730"," because the last earnings report we actually were surprised by the inferencing demand it was about"
"16432730","16437509"," 40 percent of total data center revenue which was a lot higher than anybody anticipated the concern"

"16746060","16752040"," premiums we invest those premiums the longer we get to do that the more money we make and it"
"16752040","16757540"," occurred to us that it's profoundly odd that we never tried to help our customers live a longer"
"16757540","16762700"," healthier life so several years ago we introduced a new program called john hankock vitality and we"
"16762700","16767380"," actively partner with our customers now providing them with education tools and interestingly"
"16767380","16772840"," incentives and rewards discounts and goodies and things for taking steps to live a longer healthier"
"16772840","16778400"," life basically promoting their own longevity okay what's the impact of a higher rate environment"
"16778400","16783400"," then on your business well generally speaking higher rates are good for the insurance industry we"
"16783400","16788060"," lived through a very long period of time i could i can remember post financial crisis we would sit"
"16788060","16792460"," around in meetings and say now when interest rates go back up we're going to do x y and z"
"16792460","16795900"," after two or three years of that we stopped having meetings where we talked about what are we going"
"16795900","16799560"," to do when interest rates go back up um so we don't spend a lot of time now thinking about"
"16799560","16803440"," what we're going to do when they come back down but it looks as though things are going to be"
"16803440","16808660"," fairly uneventful this week i think with a fed with perhaps some action heating up in june and and"
"16808660","16814540"," beyond it does seem clear i think that certainly higher rates somewhat higher rates are here to"
"16814540","16819660"," stay for a bit even if they tick down some and as i said that's generally a positive for our"
"16819660","16825120"," industry and what is the relationship between gas prices and insurance this was uh quite"
"16825120","16830620"," fascinating um a couple interesting things happened during covid you know always looking for the"
"16830620","16836500"," silver lining covid was a awful time in in our history and for many of us personally but um it"
"16836500","16841900"," did spur a lot of demand for life insurance go figure people global global pandemic things can"
"16841900","16846540"," happen what happens if something happened to me and i did not have the protection of life insurance"
"16846540","16852840"," so we saw demand really shoot up during covid for life insurance but interestingly when inflation"
"16852840","16858200"," started to really tick up we started noticing that applications for life insurance below a certain"
"16858200","16865600"," size dropped quite quickly and i had somebody on the team plot the retail price of gas at the pump"
"16866110","16871740"," with life insurance applications below say five hundred thousand dollar death benefit amounts and"
"16871740","16876460"," you'll never see jhana chart more perfectly correlated and it kind of makes sense right if you know"
"16876460","16881000"," middle america you sit there and say geez i need life insurance i want life insurance but if it"
"16881000","16885740"," costs you know 30 percent more at the grocery store or 40 percent more at the pump you're"
"16885740","16889860"," absolutely it becomes a nice to have rather than have to have got to get this question to you"
"16889860","16894600"," before we have to to close and that's about artificial intelligence it seems to me like the"

"16909860","16915600"," both in the u.s with john hankock and our parent company manual life globally and you think about"
"16915600","16920640"," what ai could do there as it relates to interventions is a strong term but if we notice something"
"16920640","16925460"," going on with the client less physically active than they were perhaps digital nudges and things"
"16925460","16932020"," like that and using ai to say geez we should prompt brooks to do x um we spent a lot"
"16932020","16936980"," of time and energy doing what we call underwriting people somebody applies for insurance we look at"
"16936980","16941260"," their history medical history and otherwise and decide what rate is appropriate you could imagine"
"16941260","16946560"," ai playing an important role in improving the efficiency there so uh quite excited that we're being"
"16946560","16951820"," cautious as many are and prudent but and and want to do it in a way that serves our customers"
"16951820","16957880"," well but enormous opportunity yeah i i like the idea of having those prompts that are good for"
"16957880","16961220"," everybody a lot of times we think about insurance companies wanting to know a little bit too much"
"16961220","16966100"," but if you can make some correlations that actually help everybody out that's better brooks thank"

"17206870","17211250"," going to say about demand for ai chips and what they've got in the pipeline coming up on wednesday"
"17211810","17217650"," fed chair j pal will hear from him 230 eastern time following the fed decision on interest rates"
"17217650","17223230"," what will he say about the timing of rate cuts and the tone and tenor of the economy right now"
"17223230","17228510"," and which of these has the greater potential to move the markets for that let's bring in mike"
"17228510","17233870"," santoli what do you say mike i mean i suppose this is one of those low suspense moments for the"
"17233870","17238190"," fed no one thinks they're going to do much but what they say could be important maybe there's a"
"17238190","17243110"," little more suspense in what genson wong might say you know i i think there's suspense in some of"
"17243110","17247210"," the details of what genson wong might say but i'm actually going to go with power on this mostly"
"17247210","17253890"," because we're pretty sure genson was going to reaffirm the huge vision for the future and in vidius"
"17253890","17260390"," role in it in ai in the next stages of it and multiple years worth of demand the other piece"
"17260390","17266070"," of it is in vidius stock does its own thing even in the absence of fresh news so if the"
"17266070","17271910"," stock for some reason were to go down off of what wong says tonight or today it could just be"
"17271910","17275090"," that it was a sell in the news event the market needed to correct a little bit in other words"
"17275090","17278690"," what he says is for the long term not the short term when it comes to power i think there's"
"17278690","17284530"," a lot of room for interpretation how tolerant is he going to sound about this little uptick in"
"17284530","17290990"," inflation how might he view the recent rise in longer-term treasury yields is the economy really"
"17290990","17295970"," good enough shape to withstand all those things are they're going to take away one projected rate"
"17295970","17300890"," cut or something like that so i do think that as the real economy and people try to sort through"
"17300890","17306350"," what the rest of this year might be i think pal might have a lot more to say even though"
"17306350","17311830"," we don't think they're is is there a case if i accept your your premise there that that pal may"
"17311830","17316810"," be the more important speaker this week and i i don't want to dispute that is there a case that"
"17316810","17323290"," may be taking root a little bit that there might be no interest rate cuts this year that rate cuts"
"17323290","17330930"," may go off the table if there continued to be these little wobbles in the inflation numbers i do"
"17330930","17335190"," you think you have heard some folks say that that if basically things are not tracking in a"
"17335190","17342490"," direction that would necessitate rate cuts i do think though that the fed itself will be very slow"
"17342490","17347570"," to get to that point just because they're broad framework says they're very restrictive with rates"
"17347570","17352430"," above five percent even if inflation stays where it is they may have something more to say about"
"17352430","17357010"," what the ultimate neutral rate is maybe it's higher than they thought before that would indicate"
"17357010","17362710"," less room to cut but i do think that they'll probably move in increments and probably also hope to"
"17362710","17367230"," get lucky in the next couple of months on the inflation data so that maybe it looks like a"
"17367230","17372230"," summertime cut is going to be more time all right mike santoli thanks very much for more on the big"
"17372230","17376810"," week for the markets and what matters the most for your money let's bring in richard bernstein ceo"
"17376810","17382210"," and cio of richard bernstein advisors llc rich good to have you i assume you just heard my question"
"17382210","17387910"," to mike and his answer to it what do you think there is there a case maybe it's a low"
"17387910","17393410"," probability case that the fed might not cut interest rates this year and just let things sit where"
"17393410","17399270"," they are oh well tyler good afternoon i first i would say i think the probability is much higher"
"17399790","17406970"," than people think or even higher than the fed things that they will not lower rates this year um"
"17406970","17413630"," you know the economy is healthy uh the monthly inflation numbers the cpi trough like last jr july"
"17414190","17420470"," if you look at that they've actually been accelerating since then um financial conditions are easy"
"17420470","17426270"," they're not easing they're easy we see that in things like credit spreads so one would say that the"
"17426270","17433650"," fed should ease in a situation where the economy is suffering where there is too much uh tightness"
"17433650","17439290"," in the financial markets that the liquidity is drawing up that lending is drawing up uh none of the"
"17439290","17445470"," above is happening so rather if you look at things like copper you look at things like lumber uh"
"17445470","17450690"," you'll find that it looks like the economy is actually getting stronger so um i would argue the"
"17450690","17456390"," fed's not cutting this year okay so that i was you you answered my question you said number one"
"17456390","17461150"," that the the likelihood that they don't cut is much higher than people are uh acknowledging at this"
"17461150","17467410"," point but there you just seem to say that your base case now is that the fed won't cut rates"
"17467410","17472630"," this year am i right well i i think for me personally i think that's i i think as the"
"17472630","17477510"," year progresses and if they're not lowering rates i think it'll be more difficult to lower rates in"
"17477510","17482130"," front of the election i know the fed is not a political entity but they wanted they don't want to"
"17482130","17489930"," be viewed as a political entity either so i think given the um uh the tenacity of this election"
"17489930","17494170"," shall we say that we we have to be a little careful about what happens as we lead into the"
"17494170","17500570"," election and uh the credibility of the central bank uh might be at stake in in that case so so"
"17500570","17505550"," i think it gets harder so um you know i would argue that if they're going to lower rates and"
"17505550","17510990"," they don't do it soon it's probably not happening this year this is all very fascinating and and i"
"17510990","17516430"," i tend to sort of be more in your camp Richard i feel like with every economic data point that"
"17516430","17523190"," comes out and so if we use your base case as our scenario how would you suggest investing in the"
"17523190","17528730"," markets when we've got the 10 year above 4.3 right now what would you do what would you advise"
"17528730","17534010"," your clients in an election year in a time where rates are still quite elevated yeah so Courtney"
"17534010","17539190"," we've been trying to invest in the parts of the market and our portfolios are very heavily weighted"
"17539190","17544910"," in the parts of the market that are causing rates to go up right so i mentioned like copper prices"
"17544910","17549970"," are going up lumber prices are going up we're very much in and and even oil has started to go"
"17549970","17555410"," up as well so we are overweight energy we overweight industrials we are overweight material stocks"
"17555410","17561190"," we're overweight small caps or overweight emerging markets my argument would be that if the global"
"17561190","17566250"," economy is stronger than people think you want to invest in stocks are going to benefit from that"
"17566250","17571890"," un-unanticipated strength what about the magnificent seven as we spend so much time today talking"
"17571890","17579530"," about Nvidia well i i would say what's unanticipated about the magnificent seven um it's i think"
"17579530","17582870"," it's going to be pretty hard to find something that people are not anticipating for the magnificent"
"17582870","17589110"," seven um and i think that's you know pretty well known but but i think the magnificent seven and"
"17589110","17594630"," there's clearly a speculative side to the magnificent seven we could argue how much we could argue"
"17594630","17599390"," are they in a bubble you know where the but there's clearly a speculative side to what's going on"
"17599390","17605010"," right are there really only seven growth stories in the entire global equity market of course not"
"17605010","17609750"," there's many more but the fact that we have a name for seven of them shows how speculative the"
"17609750","17616410"," environment has gotten and so i think that they if look if the Fed can't provide more liquidity"
"17616410","17622530"," which i think is what people are banking on that argues that speculation is more likely to subside"
"17622910","17628330"," than to grow people i think want the Fed to ease as quickly as possible because Wall Street we're"
"17628330","17633970"," liquidity junkies we can't get enough liquidity and so we'd love to have the Fed ease i just think"
"17633970","17640410"," with credit spreads and everything else i mentioned before as as as positive as they are why would"
"17640410","17646350"," the Fed be rushing to ease i don't understand that so let's you mentioned speculation and that"
"17646350","17653170"," brings to mind bitcoin how do you characterize what's been going on there um i view it as as it"
"17653170","17658330"," has all the classic signs of a of a financial bubble um every single one of them is in"
"17658330","17666570"," cryptocurrencies you know the even even the notion of of of of scarcity which people talk a lot of"
"17666570","17671530"," with bitcoin that's been talked about in every financial bubble there's a scarcity and what happens"
"17671530","17676570"," is you just have more and more other things come about which we would call other cryptocurrencies"
"17677250","17681850"," um you know and you're seeing that um when people can't trade bitcoin they go trade other"
"17681850","17686870"," cryptocurrencies i think it's about as bubble-ish as you can get i think that is a divining rod for"
"17686870","17690590"," the Fed if you get the pun here the divining rod for the Fed in terms of how much liquidity"
"17690590","17697030"," there is and the fact that bitcoin is you know 65 to 70,000 is telling you there is too"
"17697030","17702550"," much speculative liquidity in the economy and why the Fed would want to ease when there's that much"
"17702550","17708170"," speculative liquidity is beyond me all right rich clearly stated thank you sir as always good to"
"17708170","17713070"," see you rich Bernstein and the rangers are doing well i see that jersey back there go rangers great"
"17713070","17718790"," they beat up the islanders yesterday it was great good stuff thanks rich see you and sticking with"
"17718790","17723990"," Nvidia all eyes on its developer conference dubbed the Woodstock of AI that's kicking off in San"
"17723990","17730510"," Jose California it's stock up slightly as investors await the debut of its new B100 GPU the company"
"17730510","17735810"," is expected to release information on pricing performance and customer demand and when it and this"
"17735810","17740990"," all comes of course as we're hearing about a potential AI tie-up between Google and Apple so for"
"17740990","17745270"," more on all of this we're going to turn to Daniel Newman CEO Futurium group who is at the GTC"
"17745270","17750410"," conference on our own Steve Kovac who joins us on set um Daniel let me start with you obviously"
"17750410","17754550"," we've been going to our own Christina parts and elbows all day along with her expectations i know"
"17754550","17758550"," we're going to hear from Jensen Wong later in the afternoon but what is it that you want to hear"
"17758550","17767070"," about this specific chip or or anything else Nvidia frankly going forward this is the it stock yeah"
"17767070","17771110"," there's a lot of people out there right now that are kind of thinking speculating has Nvidia topped"
"17771110","17775870"," off or is there more room to run and if you're an investor you want to hear do they have"
"17775870","17780730"," the technological moat do they have the software lock-in with the developers with what they're"
"17780730","17784670"," going to build for CUDA and for hybrid architectures that are going to be able to keep investors"
"17784670","17790770"," and keep the market churning with GPUs based on Nvidia we know the B100 is coming we know it's more"
"17790770","17796410"," powerful it's going to compete with AMD's new MI series that had a lot of excitement but really"
"17796410","17802630"," it's they have 99 percent of this GPU market and all the demand is going their way can they keep"
"17802630","17808270"," it do investors and do the users and developers walk away from this conference and say this"
"17808270","17813990"," technology has it it is where it needs to be and the competition is going to stay locked out i"
"17813990","17818730"," think that's what we want to see from this conference this week Daniel earlier in February on power"
"17818730","17823830"," lunch you you said that you believed that Nvidia had reached some level of a trade peak obviously"
"17823830","17829390"," we've seen a little bit of a pullback but where are your expectations of where this stock can go or"
"17829390","17832530"," does a lot of it hinge on what we're going to hear about this new chip this new B100?"
"17833590","17838110"," yeah so my concerns tend to be about the competition that's coming in it's coming in for multiple"
"17838110","17843190"," places it comes from AMD of course Intel wants to have a play here but it's also coming from the"
"17843190","17847630"," cloud providers its own partners that are building these asics that are offering training and"
"17847630","17852950"," inference capabilities in some cases with less power or at a lower cost and as these start to enter"
"17852950","17858130"," the market does Nvidia still have the ability to grow market share and also maintain these"
"17858130","17863790"," incredible margins and so without having the absolute superiority in technology i start to see some"
"17863790","17868290"," of these new entrants coming into the market and potentially putting risk on that margin and risk"
"17868290","17873330"," on that growth rate and as we hit four quarters of this incredible growth rate at some point those"
"17873330","17878390"," numbers are going to be you know mid double digits not triple digit growth and we'll start to start"
"17878390","17883910"," to worry at that point so Steve i was going to ask sort of a similar question there how deep"
"17883910","17891570"," or wide is Nvidia's moat in these kinds of chips and and are they vulnerable as Daniel seem to"
"17891570","17896290"," indicate two potential competition it's also quite wide though because also what we're expecting"
"17896290","17900930"," Nvidia to talk about today is the software side of things that they have that kind of locked up too"
"17900930","17906730"," so that in essence is the moat like AMD doesn't necessarily have those same software tools to play"
"17906730","17911990"," around with its AI chips until we have really very few details on what it's doing here and it"
"17911990","17916410"," announced the chip it says it's going to come this year that's about all we know but so right now"
"17916410","17921890"," it still is just Nvidia we see the big tech giants kind of messing around and making their own"
"17921890","17926870"," chips but there's no one else i mean there's really no one else doing it so the moat is huge"

"19412000","19418820"," might arise from what they're doing but you know also we need to figure out how do we teach some"
"19418820","19424160"," of those other values and i'm not sure of jumping from team to team every single year does that i'm"
"19424160","19428140"," not sure how we do that other than i think it's just a challenge for leadership i think it's"

"19432720","19437600"," across and then and then what about another challenge if you see players that some schools unionize"

"21444410","21449270"," it's your friend so you've got some pricing power now we're expecting roughly 10% earnings growth"

"21558310","21563330"," even like a top three reason was that Fed's got a cut rate soon and deep right it seems like"
"21563330","21567670"," if the economy is okay like bull markets don't tend to end because the economy was holding up well"
"21567670","21573670"," but how do you see this though you know after we've had all this kind of low volatility upside in"
"21573670","21579970"," the market and bonds at least sniffing out the possibility of higher for longer back on the table"
"21579970","21585830"," yeah I don't even know if um qualified yeah to understand three quarters of what you said because I"
"21585830","21591210"," don't pay here not cool I don't want to think about it and Japanese monetary policy I know even"
"21591210","21595950"," less about I traded the end six times in my life my PA lost money all this time so on"

"21602290","21606970"," the part that I could debate a little and I don't have a strong view is just whether if they"
"21606970","21610930"," go from three cuts to two in the consensus view if it'll matter for equities at all I could see"
"21610930","21616450"," somebody saying hey you know what um good news is good sure now let's forget all this stuff we"
"21616450","21620930"," invented after the financial crisis bad is good and good is bad and how about just we're in this"
"21620930","21626530"," pocket here where decent economic news means the Fed doesn't have to be uh as accommodated we're"
"21626530","21631810"," all guilty of using the last three cycles as part of our average which include TMT financial crisis"
"21631810","21635590"," and COVID none of which have anything to do with the current conditions yeah and so all right if"
"21635590","21639150"," the economy is a little better and they only do it twice like maybe that's actually pretty good I I"
"21639150","21643450"," don't know if they go three to two it matters that much I get what he's saying which is all"
"21643450","21646890"," right if they get a little direction he hogged he could get a couple days where trades off around"
"21646890","21650570"," that commentary right but holistically I think it could be pretty good and I still think earnings"
"21650570","21654610"," are gonna be up so yeah maybe that's the only thing he said that I'm even qualified to respond to"
"21654610","21659930"," I mean and Jordan I mean I guess the other question is the reason that you might be concerned is"
"21659930","21664490"," if you think that a lot of the stronger economic numbers have been a bit of a head fake in"
"21664490","21668310"," other words the Fed's gonna stay too tight because they're gonna be focusing on you know they're"
"21668310","21674330"," sitting here waiting for shelter inflation to come down like everybody expects it to come down and"
"21674330","21678730"," while they wait for that you know the underlying economy maybe struggles a little more but it's"
"21678730","21682950"," hard to find the evidence of that yeah but but importantly they situated themselves where they're"
"21682950","21688150"," not going from okay three to two cuts so long as they're not going back to hikes yeah sure right"
"21688150","21693790"," that's really the key from a macro standpoint so so long as the Fed remains in this sort of cutting"
"21693790","21700110"," bias and that's three two one I think that's generally pretty pretty supportive they think rates"
"21700110","21704810"," are restrictive and actually interesting enough if you go back to 1980 there have been 14 calendar"
"21704810","21710110"," years with effect cut rates and there wasn't a recession in the US economy 13 of those 14 years the"
"21710110","21715430"," equity market was positive by about 15 and a half percent the only year outlier was 2002 and I"
"21715430","21719150"," think we had a little bit of a hangover from from the tech bubble so sure this is a micro"
"21719150","21723110"," environment that Adam talked about that's very supportive earnings growing and then you've got a"
"21723110","21727810"," macro invited that's supportive that the Fed's got a bias towards easing so I'm I'm with that I'm"
"21727810","21732030"," bullish on the market if the if the I agree with the Fed Heights I think we're selling what's"
"21732030","21736670"," selling off I agree with that yeah but I but I think you know look you know our Trivera we"
"21736670","21741490"," don't but also take time for probably for them to get to that point of right of making them they"
"21741490","21746170"," need different data on jobs and inflation our website you search pallets as zero search results you"
"21746170","21750870"," know that's how we do we look underneath and I just see so many opportunities to buy things"
"21750870","21755490"," underneath that it to me it feels very optimistic about security selection active security"
"21755490","21760270"," selection and and I think the risk score is still positive yeah um and you know to your point"
"21760270","21765230"," Jordan I was looking back in 1995 everyone you know I've been bringing it up as the the ultimate"
"21765230","21772110"," you know soft landing if everything went perfectly set cut twice july in december after a long"
"21772110","21776790"," tightening cycle so I'm sure that's that's in your data set of markets that that treated it well"
"21776790","21779770"," yeah but there was still scope for the unemployment rate to keep coming down that's right i'll"
"21779770","21783270"," think the unemployment rate can push down any lower that's no that's a lot of the other stuff"
"21783270","21787970"," doesn't match up exactly but we'll pick and choose as we can all right guys thanks a lot yeah good"

"22070480","22076380"," your work is pointing to kind of fairly valued perhaps but there are things to do maybe unexploited"
"22076380","22080800"," areas why does energy get into that category so it's funny Mike I was talking to some of my sales"
"22080800","22085120"," people earlier today and I said sectors just haven't been that interesting of a discussion lately"
"22085120","22090420"," and all of a sudden energy got really interesting I just sort of had this big move we've been"
"22090420","22094200"," overweight we viewed it as an inflation hedge in the portfolio and guess what everyone's not"
"22094200","22098020"," worried about inflation again in interest rates and so it's kind of doing what we hoped it would do"
"22098020","22102920"," it serving the right function but putting that issue aside I mean it's cheap my analysts like it"
"22102920","22107140"," much more so than my analysts in other sectors so I think that's an important read on fundamentals"
"22107140","22112420"," and money flows if you look at the EPFR data is starting to shift back in areas you know"
"22112420","22117900"," commodities materials energy industrials kind of these cyclical areas that should benefit if the"
"22117900","22122600"," economy really is running hot the way everyone's worried so and is that you read on it because I"
"22122600","22126760"," mean obviously the underlying commodities have had a move as well you feel like it's kind of a"
"22126760","22132580"," global demand overlay I think it's a I think it's the us is running pretty hot obviously there's"

"22142240","22146160"," not so much the last couple weeks but maybe about a month ago or so there were there was a"
"22146160","22151220"," conversation about a bottoming in China that we were hearing a good bit about so I think we're you"
"22151220","22155260"," know kind of in this weird healing process and energy is benefiting from that right now you do"

"22179840","22185760"," model has been pointing to upside to say 5,400 or so multiple of around 23.3 times on a"
"22185760","22190960"," trailing basis that's if you buy the idea that interest rates are going to moderate the Fed's going"
"22190960","22194080"," to do a certain amount of cuts and inflation is going to come down 10 years going to come down"
"22194080","22198120"," and maybe those are a little bit aggressive we wrote about that in our weekly today and we said if"
"22198120","22202240"," you just leave interest rates where they are and you know depending on your earnings view it's more"
"22202240","22208500"," like 5,000 to 5,200 so right where we're stalling but sentiment is a problem now people don't feel"

"22332720","22337600"," dance and so that just felt a little uncomfortable so I think it was natural to take a pause I"
"22337600","22342300"," think that basically that November December move was all about the Fed cutting rates and we said"

"22411940","22416340"," as much of a journey so it hasn't really caused us as much angst yeah presumably he's not going to"

"22711200","22716760"," you have stocks massively outperforming bonds recently I've been hearing a lot about you know being"

"22722560","22727920"," act of dynamic how do you see things right I think that's very much true the average public pension"
"22727920","22732340"," plan in the US has about a seven percent return hurdle somewhere between six and a quarter seven"
"22732340","22737360"," and a half ish but let's call it seven percent and for a decade almost there wasn't the fixed"
"22737360","22742120"," income book to really pull from to get some of those returns now you have more asset classes to"
"22742120","22747280"," pull from to generate lower risk returns potentially and so you can actually pull back from some of"
"22747280","22751920"," the more growthy areas or high risk areas I would say that we're still at Goldman bullish on"
"22751920","22757160"," equities potentially over credit right now and but you can start to look at your portfolio and say"
"22757160","22761540"," you know how much do I need to have in some of these riskier assets and can we look at"
"22761540","22766760"," new sorts of investments a good example of this is infrastructure right so we all know what"
"22766760","22772040"," infrastructure is but actually it's really only 20 years new in institutional and portfolios and"
"22772040","22777020"," really still nascent in most and if you think about private equity which in some public pensions in"
"22777020","22781140"," the United States is now just getting off the ground some of them aren't even at target that's been"
"22781140","22786500"," around 50 years so to say 20 years in infrastructure that means you really have about maybe 30, 40"
"22786500","22791640"," more years for that to really get off the ground and become a bigger stronghold in portfolios and"
"22791640","22796480"," one of the reasons I believe that institutions are looking at them are there a lot of tailwinds but"
"22796480","22800560"," it also might be a good diversifier to portfolio right now I was going to say so yeah we all"
"22800560","22805280"," know generally what infrastructure is but as an investable asset class I mean it can be I mean"
"22805280","22810720"," there's infrastructure funds what hydropower or pipelines I mean what does it comprise and I guess"
"22810720","22814900"," what are the return characteristics and how does it diversify away from other things so you went"
"22814900","22819760"," right to hydropower which is great but I think most people think steel concrete or the road I drive"
"22819760","22824560"," every day gosh it has so many potholes but you're right it's not just steel and concrete anymore"
"22824560","22830540"," it's a lot of things it's fiber it's renewables it's data centers and it has a lot of the same"
"22830540","22835780"," themes that we've been talking about in our 2024 outlook and even our 2023 outlook which is the 40s"
"22836260","22843120"," de-globalization demographic digitization and I'm forgetting the fourth one here but but yeah so it"
"22843120","22849340"," has those tailwinds we have regulatory tailwinds these also also are typically acid heavy some have"
"22849340","22854680"," you know pretty strong cash flows and they have inflation protection either regulatory or embedded"
"22854680","22860400"," in contracts or they have such a market share they can pass some of those onto the consumer so you"
"22860400","22864700"," know really this is a position of strength for infrastructure and we see tailwinds going on for"
"22864700","22870920"," decades all right so infrastructure is the first eye India is the other one this is a market a lot"
"22870920","22875460"," of folks have had high hopes on for a while but why do you think it's timely okay you know"
"22875460","22879900"," we're not novel here saying that we're constructive on India but we are bullish on India and it"
"22879900","22885400"," doesn't have a lot of place in institutional portfolios right now and we've seen a pretty good run"
"22885400","22889700"," but one of the reasons we like India we like emerging markets in general we think there's a lot of"
"22889700","22894540"," opportunity there from a growth perspective but in India you get a lot of visibility into earnings"
"22894540","22899560"," which you may not get into other emerging markets and it's been consistent over times when we say"
"22899560","22904220"," we think there might be double-digit EPS growth there we have more confidence say that we might"
"22904220","22909700"," have elsewhere and similarly you know it has a lot of tailwinds behind it as well is that because"
"22909700","22913740"," of just transparency of reporting that you have that visibility into earnings or just because of"
"22913740","22918220"," the you know the fundamental drive i think it's a combination of both of those things which should"
"22918220","22922800"," give investors increased confidence to look at those markets we are seeing a lot of interest in"
"22922800","22928120"," emerging markets that would be one that we think has particular opportunities here you know the"
"22928120","22933100"," traditional way of thinking about emerging markets when it comes to central bank policy is that"
"22933100","22940420"," Fedese's emerging markets get a tailwind is that equation still in effect so well i do think this"
"22940420","22945420"," year we should be less concerned about what the Fed is going to do with respect to these markets"
"22945420","22949000"," because there's a lot of uncertainty particularly in the last couple weeks we think the general"
"22949000","22953640"," trajectory is the same right we're going to end up in the same place with the pace of that so"
"22953640","22958560"," if you're going to look at these emerging markets i'd be thinking more over the long term i think"
"22958560","22962320"," in the shorter term look we usually look at emerging markets when certain things happen with the"
"22962320","22967680"," dollar right but i think we could be in a scenario in a year or two where the dollar's position"
"22967680","22971540"," has changed and do we want to in a year or two start thinking about where we want to be"
"22971540","22974880"," in the world or do we want to think about it now and we want to get in before you"
"22974880","22979760"," know there's massive flows going into that area sure and india i guess is not really an export"
"22979760","22984320"," driven i mean it's obviously what's going on there and give us the economy right and you've got you"
"22984320","22989200"," know you've got some other things there that that may help diversify your portfolio so i think if i"
