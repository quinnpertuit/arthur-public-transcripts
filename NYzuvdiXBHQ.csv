"12580","13580"," Hold on here."
"15480","17440"," I guess we've got some walkiness. "
"20180","21380"," Twitter API."

"32450","33090"," Love."
"36750","38390"," Is anybody in here right now?"
"39190","40330"," Can you guys all see me right now?"
"40330","40390"," Yeah."
"43670","45050"," You guys can all see me out there. "
"47750","48230"," Cool."
"48530","48610"," Cool."
"49570","53780"," Can you hear me?"
"54400","54860"," How about that?"
"55000","55660"," Can you hear me out there?"
"57060","63110"," All right, good. "
"63610","67710"," Twitter API for reposting these videos is broken this morning."
"70370","71310"," Good morning, everybody."
"103220","104040"," Good morning. "
"104820","107600"," You guys can see the scrolling text and stuff, right?"
"109220","110520"," You guys see the scrolling."
"110760","113420"," You guys can see like the welcome to."
"113500","113820"," Okay. "
"113960","114200"," All right."
"114300","114360"," Cool."
"114480","114520"," Cool. "
"135070","136230"," Good morning out there."
"137310","143010"," So I've got some, uh, we have some issues here with like a Twitter API, baby."
"143750","148890"," Uh, no longer functioning with, uh, streamlabs. "
"149650","150390"," Okay."
"151770","154770"," I guess that's what it is."
"155530","157410"," That's an Netflix spy cues. "
"158290","159350"," Boy, oh boy."
"159550","160150"," Oh boy."
"160410","160990"," This morning. "
"161390","163030"," What is going on out there?"
"163730","165990"," What the fuck is going on?"
"166670","168790"," Oh, wow."
"170110","170550"," Shocker."
"172110","172830"," Boy. "
"173210","173990"," Oh boy."
"174070","176430"," Lots of talk yesterday and fin to it."
"177730","179250"," Proof in the pudding. "
"180710","181810"," And yet."
"184970","188650"," The proof in the pudding has nothing to do with."
"190210","192330"," We have range expansion today. "
"193050","198430"," We are now, we now in pre market have a high higher than yesterday."
"198430","202390"," Trade in four fifty four ninety four."
"205030","208270"," Emotions running high out there. "
"209670","212230"," Even worse, if you get it right."
"213710","217730"," Then if you make the wrong call out there."
"220920","223120"," Because you're pissed people off. "
"224720","225560"," Okay."
"226860","228580"," I hurt your feelings."
"231180","231700"," Okay. "
"231920","232320"," I get it."
"232840","233900"," That's what it is."
"234360","235180"," Good morning. "
"235380","236160"," I saw CV day."
"236360","238520"," Congratulations on CV and A by the way."
"239360","241620"," I have something I got to do really quick here. "
"242840","245280"," I got to post the live stream here."
"245460","245760"," Hold on a"
"247840","257600"," second here."
"257600","258200"," You can't win. "
"260720","263500"," When you call it right, you get slammed."
"265140","267940"," Somehow creating controversy on Twitter this morning."
"268120","269560"," I'm like, how the fuck am I doing that?"
"270520","273480"," All right. "
"273620","273880"," Whatever."
"274260","274800"," I don't know."
"274940","278760"," I think part of it is people that wants to get followers or something. "
"278760","282140"," Something possibly like feeding feed and followers that kind of stuff."
"282140","283220"," It's possible what it is."
"283340","287760"," I got to post this here really quick to me one quick second here. "
"288200","290140"," I got some I got some stuff I got to do."
"291520","293900"," So I want to clarify something here."
"294680","295660"," I think I've. "
"297740","300900"," I want to clarify something if you're a viewer here."
"301360","303420"," Let's make some some clarity here."
"306920","308480"," Because I think that there's. "
"308920","309500"," There we go."
"309620","310280"," Post it all that."
"314480","315620"," Post it all that. "
"317600","318200"," We got it."
"318300","319560"," We got some house cleaning to do."
"319900","320900"," We got a bunch of house things. "
"321100","321800"," So we talked about this."
"321920","322560"," I think on Monday."
"323680","326640"," And so look at us. "
"326760","327900"," Look at us right now."
"327900","329720"," Number 5501 on this."
"329900","330680"," We have one minute left. "
"332060","334840"," I want you to realize something here."
"335020","338100"," And that is that we're coming right into supply."
"339060","343060"," We have done that in the past of explorations. "
"344060","346240"," So so just watch this here."
"346340","348140"," This reaction off the opening bell here."
"348840","350500"," And see if we come into some supply here. "
"350600","354000"," Wait a look down here at this supply."
"354200","357480"," These are sellers trying to step in right on the opening bell this morning."
"358000","363460"," Have seen this on passive explorations where you you're like all bullish on the opening bell and"
"363460","363820"," boom. "
"363820","365160"," They sell right into you."
"365740","367440"," We'll see how this goes in here."
"368580","369940"," It's so funny this morning. "
"370400","372300"," I didn't know all this was going on in the background."
"373000","375020"," I didn't know it was a bunch of stuff that I didn't know."
"375100","375980"," And then of course it's morning. "
"376160","378280"," I'm like, oh, okay, whatever."
"379100","380940"," But we'll discuss it at some point this morning."
"383260","385180"," It's weird too because things get out. "
"385300","386920"," Oh, dude, they're getting squeezed right out."
"386920","388060"," Look at that squeeze man."
"388560","389740"," 455 dude. "
"390280","392640"," Just hammered into supply right now."
"395280","398740"," Whoa, 45538 R1 above and 456."
"406780","408220"," Oh, man. "
"408400","409620"," Do I do I do I post?"
"409940","411500"," Do I do the repost this morning?"
"411500","414380"," Do I not do the repost this morning?"
"418100","419320"," Victory is sweet."
"426590","427930"," Victory is sweet."
"430070","430990"," Here, here. "
"431350","432630"," We'll put some paint on."
"434630","442960"," We'll put some paint on."
"442960","445400"," Oh boy. "
"447680","450080"," We'll put the paint on right now."
"450760","451960"," How's it going out there?"
"453000","454760"," How's your puts doing right now?"
"454880","455660"," They're fine, dude."
"466420","467380"," Oh shit. "
"470140","471460"," How's it going out there?"
"471700","472880"," What are y'all doing out there?"
"474860","475620"," Wait a minute."
"475700","478480"," I didn't see what's going on with my profile here for some reason."
"479740","480700"," There we go. "
"485120","487800"," I guess we can't put that on, can we?"
"495730","497330"," Oh man, I tell you what."
"497650","498250"," I tell you what."
"498430","505670"," I can't spend a lot of time on Fintuit because I think I'm at a point where I can't be"
"505670","507630"," on Fintuit because it just causes fucking. "
"508150","511510"," Joe Donut once said you just can't feed the people in the comments anymore."
"512230","513770"," Just stop responding to people."
"513770","515690"," And I was like, all right. "
"515929","519929"," 4.55.70. Yay."
"520690","521470"," How you doing out there?"
"521570","521909"," How's it feel?"
"530940","531800"," Oh man."
"533820","534640"," Killing me. "
"538420","539140"," Killing me."
"539240","539740"," Good morning."
"539980","541320"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"541520","542400"," How y'all doing out there?"
"543920","544940"," How's that feeling?"
"546200","547780"," How's that feeling right there?"
"547940","548620"," How's that feeling?"
"548840","549200"," How's that feeling?"
"549260","549640"," Is that good?"
"549640","553120"," I'm trading 4.55.80 right now. "
"553320","560500"," Oh shit."
"560600","561380"," Just look at that."
"561900","563200"," Just look at that. "
"564180","565180"," Oh man."
"569880","576520"," We got our two above 4.57.82. We've got a very important number up here, right?"
"576740","578280"," 4.59.92, right?"
"581400","581920"," Okay."
"582680","584020"," Is this the place to short?"
"584220","586600"," I guess would be the question. "
"589950","591190"," This is killing me."
"591450","592670"," You can kill in me."
"603250","604110"," Oh boy. "
"604510","604870"," Okay."
"605170","607010"," So we have some stuff to go over this morning."
"608030","609690"," Let's address some things. "
"611090","613310"," Now let's start at the top here, okay?"
"613770","614690"," We have to go over some things."
"614690","615490"," We have to do some house cleaning."
"616470","624050"," Otherwise what happens is you end up losing sight of what is what?"
"624770","626850"," So let's just be on record for some stuff. "
"626850","633890"," So I spent a lot of years out there paying for services."
"635090","636410"," I paid for them all."
"636750","638230"," Over the years I've tried them all. "
"638390","639150"," I've paid for them all."
"640030","641230"," I've signed up to them all."
"642290","646390"," And oftentimes I did not get an edge. "
"647530","649510"," Remind you, remind yourself of that."
"650070","654290"," This is a key topic edge because this conversation is going to continue somewhere else later."
"655350","659130"," But I was never able to get an edge, and that's what I'm doing, right?"
"659330","659870"," I'm trying to get an edge. "
"661450","665690"," When we started live streaming, I was trying to get an edge then too, right?"
"666190","667630"," And even today I try to get an edge."
"668110","668850"," It never really ends."
"669090","675510"," As a matter of fact, I'm working on something new right now for further edge over time, right?"
"675810","677990"," Always trying to get an edge to stay ahead and all that kind of stuff. "
"678790","681290"," So, edge, very important."
"682170","691990"," Now, I was accused I think this morning of using spot gamma information without a signing,"
"692470","696970"," without a signing attribution."
"697590","699650"," Now, number one, I don't use spot gamma. "
"700010","703530"," I have in the past, they did pay for spot gamma, paid for the hero tool too."
"703530","707650"," But that was on the stream, so that's actually right."
"707910","711190"," Well, features are he's been in the talk about crude up by about one dollar. "
"711250","712570"," Talk about the things that you use."
"713350","716470"," As a matter of fact, I used to post flow, I'll go stuff on Twitter, right?"
"716690","720830"," So that's paying for, that's attributing to flow, I'll go data and stuff like that."
"721810","724430"," And also it drives business to these companies. "
"725710","728970"," So, you know, I have charts that we have that are labeled trade the trigger."
"728970","734430"," And you're likely going to snip those and post those on Twitter at some point or whatever it is you"
"734430","734930"," do with them."
"735350","743430"," So when you attribute to people, it's much different than use this and didn't talk about it. "
"744110","745350"," Or who it was from or whatever."
"745750","754290"," And what's fascinating about this is we actually have bots in our stream chat making poking fun at"
"754290","754790"," spot gamma."
"754790","761730"," Because I always liked spot gamma, but I always felt as though they didn't come out fast enough. "
"763710","770110"," Well, first of all, I thought that they were never, it was never enough to make a decision as to"
"770110","770570"," what to do."
"771770","776170"," They're very like, this is the bull, this is the bear, this is the theta, and you had kind of"
"776170","776890"," to figure out your own."
"778190","780330"," So you couldn't get a thesis out of them in my view. "
"780330","786630"," Now, they started to give some pieces at some point that I recall, this is from my experience."
"788170","790950"," And if they were wrong, they weren't coming out quick enough."
"791230","793650"," That was my only, I said that publicly, I think on Twitter at some point. "
"794270","798570"," But I wish that they had a way to come out and say, ah, this isn't valid any longer."
"799430","802990"," That was my only real issue was that I wasn't getting what I wanted out"
"802990","809530"," of it."
"810270","811690"," Six, seven, eight hundred bucks a month. "
"812170","814730"," I want to be able to win every time."
"815190","817410"," Eight times, nine times, something like that."
"817750","818990"," So it wasn't for me. "
"819730","823330"," Now, I know that spot gamma is still for other people out there."
"823470","825310"," Other traders, they find great value in it."
"826450","830150"," As a matter of fact, we have people that come into the stream here in the chat and talk about"
"830150","830690"," spot gamma. "
"831350","832290"," So I know that it's prevalent."
"832710","833870"," I know that it's out there everywhere."
"834550","838970"," And all that does is give good traction, believe it or not, for spot gamma. "
"840150","843670"," When you talk about, it's funny because when you're on Twitter, right, it's a good place to"
"843670","844270"," describe this."
"846050","850930"," When you entertain people on Twitter, right, people that might, so if you're trying to grow an"
"850930","853070"," account on Twitter, let's see if five followers, right?"
"853690","860930"," If you go into someone's post and you say something that's, that's contrary to that post, you"
"860930","862570"," typically gain followers from that."
"863410","864410"," Doesn't matter what it is. "
"864490","865330"," Bullbear doesn't matter."
"866190","867750"," Anything that'll bring up discussion."
"868230","875650"," And what's even crazier is I've had people come into, I've had people on Twitter that will shit on"
"875650","875850"," me. "
"876790","877730"," They're like trolls."
"878370","884950"," And what they'll do is they'll go out there and they'll pick one of my posts and say something"
"884950","887670"," like, I don't know, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about."
"887670","892750"," Or this guy sucks, or this guy's always wrong, or whatever it is, doesn't matter what they say. "
"893530","896790"," And they're genuinely upset or angry or emotional or whatever."
"897730","899570"," It's a key thing for you to listen to here."
"899810","906790"," So what that P person doesn't understand is that they're gaining me followers. "
"908430","910070"," So I will sometimes go out there."
"910210","915170"," If I see someone that's constantly doing this, I will go find these people and say, Hey man, look,"
"915410","916390"," I'm not going to block you or anything."
"916390","917470"," I'm not going to mute you. "
"918710","922550"," But I do want you to know that it doesn't matter what you say."
"923090","927910"," The more controversial thing, the more controversial the statement that you're making about myself."
"929110","932190"," The more traction you give me to gain followers. "
"932230","934010"," And I don't think that that's your intent."
"935150","936650"," And I'll tell these people this."
"937450","941030"," And I don't think that they always realize that when they're shooting on somebody. "
"942450","946330"," They're normally gaining that other person followers."
"947430","953370"," And the reason being or the psychology behind this is if I go on Twitter and I say this guy"
"953370","954810"," specifically this guy sucks."
"955870","957450"," You're going to be like what guy, right?"
"957770","958790"," And I got to go find this guy. "
"959070","961110"," Now I got to follow him and now I got to read all of his shit."
"961830","965930"," And what you're doing is you're actually giving that person traction, right?"
"966590","968810"," So some of you understand this and a lot of you don't."
"968810","971870"," And I know that is a small class of people. "
"972170","973310"," There are trolls out there."
"973450","974670"," They're like like five percent."
"974830","975210"," Not five percent. "
"976230","978130"," One hundred people are out there."
"978390","981290"," And they do this to anyone with a follower count on Twitter."
"982050","987110"," But what these people oftentimes don't realize is that they're actually helping that person gain"
"987110","988370"," traction. "
"989530","991870"," And I don't feel comfortable with that."
"992150","998530"," So I tell them, I say, hey, you know, you're probably doing me more good than you're intending to"
"998530","998790"," do."
"999370","1000850"," I'll reach out to them via DM. "
"1001410","1002170"," I don't do it."
"1002230","1006450"," Sometimes I do it publicly, but oftentimes I do it in DM and say, hey, man, if you don't like"
"1006450","1011410"," me, the best thing that you could do is not repost my stuff."
"1011870","1014630"," You know, anyway, it doesn't matter. "
"1015030","1020930"," So just on that point, if you were to repost my stuff, I'm happy with that."
"1021850","1024930"," If you repost my stuff in a good or bad way, I'm happy with that."
"1024930","1029210"," If you use, as a matter of fact, we have people who come in our chat in our chat room"
"1029210","1029630"," or not. "
"1029750","1031030"," I mean, this is this video chat."
"1031589","1037150"," We've had people come into this chat and say, Hey, Captain, mind if I repost your stream in our"
"1037150","1040390"," discord or in our blog or overseas."
"1041670","1044130"," And I've always said, fuck, yeah, go ahead and do it. "
"1044630","1045750"," Like, I got no problem with it."
"1046609","1047990"," It only only helps."
"1048170","1048650"," It doesn't hurt. "
"1048890","1053190"," So when you're doing that stuff, I don't understand sometimes the."
"1055410","1056270"," What's being said?"
"1056430","1056950"," Hold on one second here."
"1066400","1067180"," Sorry about that. "
"1067320","1068260"," It's some water and stuff coming."
"1069460","1071060"," Trading are one right now."
"1071220","1072880"," You know the rules here, right?"
"1073120","1079400"," We trade above the 30 EMA and we are bullish as long as we're above. "
"1079620","1083000"," We'll look for pullbacks on resistance levels."
"1083220","1090620"," We're coming into our first one right now."
"1091340","1097980"," My point here though is that oftentimes people might think it's one thing when it's actually"
"1097980","1099180"," something completely different. "
"1100220","1104160"," So be aware sometimes of what's going, what's actually going on in the background."
"1104560","1110480"," Next thing that I need to discuss was, you know, it's funny too because that person on Twitter has"
"1110480","1113780"," like 10 followers, 20 followers, something like that."
"1114160","1117440"," So, you know, it's like, don't feed the trolls. "
"1118560","1119380"," That's one of them."
"1119380","1122060"," The second thing I wanted to address was Gem, right?"
"1122520","1125920"," I want you guys to know out there that I like Gem, always have."
"1126100","1129180"," I've said this on stream, ad nauseam for years. "
"1130220","1132700"," Gem and I had a disagreement a couple of years ago."
"1133260","1135060"," And I think he blocked me and I blocked him."
"1135280","1135880"," It was no big deal. "
"1136180","1137420"," I don't have any a little towards him."
"1137920","1138540"," I knew he was a great trader."
"1139020","1139840"," He's an ex-floor trader. "
"1140680","1141560"," I know the guy smart as fuck."
"1142440","1143840"," I got no issues with him either."
"1144020","1145720"," It's made that clear over time. "
"1146560","1147240"," He unblocked me."
"1147740","1151780"," This morning, I think, or yesterday, and I am blocked him as well."
"1152220","1155160"," So I have no ill will towards him. "
"1155340","1156920"," I know he gets a lot of calls, right?"
"1157240","1158380"," I know that he's very smart."
"1158500","1161660"," I know he drops mad knowledge on Twitter community."
"1161660","1164800"," I've always acknowledged that since day one. "
"1165040","1170760"," So somehow there's like other controversy that I don't like Gem or something."
"1170760","1172260"," That's never been the case."
"1172920","1180780"," I think it's a matter of, I think it's a more of a matter of, if you're a trader, you're"
"1180780","1181840"," an e-type personality. "
"1183000","1183800"," That's what it is."
"1184680","1185680"," And you're doing what you do."
"1185840","1188000"," I do what I do and other traders do what they do. "
"1188820","1195800"," I'm never going to always agree with Jedi or Matt Ryan or Chris or other traders, even Winky and I."
"1195880","1196840"," We don't agree all the time."
"1197880","1198780"," We're very smart."
"1199020","1199920"," We're in some ways. "
"1200400","1202300"," We're very smart and committed to what we think."
"1203600","1207040"," And we put a lot of money in the line and risk on the line for what we do."
"1207480","1208520"," Everybody does, right?"
"1209460","1215280"," And I think if you're in this, if you're in the stock market, I don't care if you're an introvert. "
"1215500","1216340"," I don't care what you are."
"1217440","1219960"," In any way, shape or form, and you're successful to some extent."
"1221400","1229280"," You are going to be some type of personality that is, you know, it's a weird thing. "
"1229460","1230320"," The army is like this."
"1231500","1232500"," The army is a weird place."
"1233220","1238300"," So when I joined the army, a lot of people looked great on paper. "
"1239540","1242500"," You, I always compare it to something called there."
"1242640","1247660"," I always say the way that I describe it was as I learned this as I as I was in"
"1247660","1248880"," the army a long time."
"1249840","1256560"," There are those that hold. "
"1257640","1259260"," There are those that fall back."
"1259880","1261880"," And there are those that move forward."
"1262580","1265340"," And there are three distinct groups of soldiers. "
"1266720","1269600"," And you learn this as time goes on."
"1270860","1272120"," And on paper."
"1273360","1279100"," And this is that different time periods in my military service, paying what was going on. "
"1279580","1282720"," You would still even even jump down into smaller and smaller groups."
"1283540","1287540"," And on paper, someone might look like, Hey, that guy over there."
"1288540","1291820"," Is like, especially when you start out when you're like basic training. "
"1293300","1297360"," You see guys in basic training that you think you're like that guy is going to be a fucking killer"
"1297360","1300640"," that guy is going to be a leader that guy is going to be this or that."
"1300900","1308480"," And then as time passes and stressors are introduced and responsibility is introduced."
"1309000","1311480"," And then you're asked to do things you might not want to do. "
"1312500","1313920"," They're not always that person."
"1314580","1316220"," And so you find that the stock."
"1316340","1318340"," I find that very relatable to the stock market. "
"1319120","1323300"," Someone that you might think would be great as an investor or trader."
"1324400","1326720"," Because they're great at other things in their life."
"1328140","1331620"," Doesn't always translate in the stock market. "
"1332720","1334700"," And so going just going back to this."
"1335020","1335680"," Yeah, we're going to disagree."
"1336800","1337600"," It's part of. "
"1337980","1339820"," It's part of what we're doing."
"1340680","1341380"," You know what I mean?"
"1341760","1345720"," So there was some trying to create someone was people trying to create some controversy over that"
"1345720","1346000"," too."
"1346000","1349200"," On Twitter and I'm like this bizarre like I've always been. "
"1351180","1355020"," Support of a gem or and respectful of them and also."
"1355700","1357160"," Realize how intelligent he is."
"1357160","1358640"," He makes great calls all the time. "
"1359160","1359720"," That kind of stuff."
"1359800","1361680"," So that's like creating controversy for controversies."
"1363740","1364780"," Sake, I guess. "
"1365280","1368300"," Yeah, so such thing is bad."
"1370840","1374120"," Just want to clarify all that makes sure it's all public out in the open."
"1374480","1376040"," And if anything, it's more. "
"1376460","1382080"," It's more just like the bleachers trying to create some controversy that isn't there."
"1382700","1383880"," It's nothing that I think about."
"1384100","1384800"," It's never been in my mind. "
"1385480","1388320"," I just know that I know you guys are a lot of you guys follow Jim."
"1389080","1390500"," And I don't know what he talks about."
"1391120","1391820"," He blocked me. "
"1391920","1394240"," I don't like I don't have access to his Twitter."
"1394620","1395880"," I don't get to see any of his posts."
"1396680","1398280"," I don't get to interact with them. "
"1398440","1400640"," I don't get to discuss any of this with his followers."
"1401140","1405100"," I just know that you guys are in the chat and you bring up this stuff."
"1405340","1406360"," And as far as the window of weakness. "
"1407260","1410600"," I didn't know that was a gem thing to be honest with you."
"1410740","1412060"," I know about the window of weakness."
"1412740","1414340"," I talk about it all the time, right?"
"1414620","1415100"," Every month. "
"1416160","1417600"," This isn't rocket science."
"1417840","1423300"," If you go into any bull market leading into the 19th to 20th fucking first."
"1423300","1424980"," We have a window of weakness. "
"1425360","1426040"," Not always."
"1426500","1427480"," It can be in the 14th."
"1428140","1429180"," It can be earlier in the month. "
"1429680","1430280"," Believe it or not."
"1430520","1433640"," But generally speaking, like on average, you can look at every month."
"1434180","1437480"," And you'll know that there's usually a dip to buy. "
"1441900","1442560"," In that."
"1443400","1446900"," That time period that it's sometimes it's earlier."
"1448260","1452340"," But generally speaking, you can you can look at any chart and say, yeah, every month in a bull"
"1452340","1452740"," market. "
"1452740","1454820"," We're going to go down for a week or so."
"1455380","1456080"," Every month."
"1456280","1457140"," That's the window of weakness. "
"1457720","1458880"," Now the question becomes."
"1459720","1461300"," I didn't know that was gem's thing."
"1461640","1463020"," It's set everywhere. "
"1463280","1465300"," It's been set everywhere since time."
"1465420","1466020"," Memorial, right?"
"1466300","1468480"," So what's bizarre here is that."
"1469780","1471800"," Even though we have that window of weakness everywhere. "
"1472000","1473540"," I know other people use that terminology."
"1474700","1477420"," The question always becomes what is that?"
"1477620","1479620"," What does that window open up to?"
"1480480","1481560"," When does it start?"
"1481560","1483220"," So you're a trader, right?"
"1483360","1483800"," You're an investor."
"1484120","1484440"," You're a trader. "
"1485200","1486840"," The key point here is that."
"1487420","1490020"," When does that window of weakness actually start?"
"1490860","1493700"," And you can see this is a great example this morning."
"1494340","1499320"," We're trading 4.56.12. And you as an investor and as a trader. "
"1500500","1502020"," Need to know."
"1502980","1504140"," When it starts."
"1506080","1510700"," You have no fucking business out there as an investor or a trader. "
"1511260","1515180"," Tearing about how smart someone is about that."
"1516580","1518320"," Or someone bringing it up."
"1518780","1519460"," You know about it. "
"1519580","1520800"," That's all you need to know, right?"
"1520980","1522380"," You can look at a chart and see it."
"1523320","1528420"," Your job as an investor and a trader is to be able to time it."
"1528920","1531100"," And when people tell you you can't time shit. "
"1531840","1533440"," Right fucking here is an example."
"1534120","1534580"," So."
"1534580","1541440"," So when people say you can't time it. "
"1542120","1544260"," Or people say you can't use your tools."
"1545060","1546140"," Your toolbox."
"1546940","1548020"," To time it. "
"1548340","1548760"," They're wrong."
"1550460","1555460"," And the person that might be giving you the data on this stuff."
"1556100","1558860"," What they're doing is different than what you're doing. "
"1559180","1562320"," So I'm a guy that's smart on the on the window of weakness."
"1562320","1565420"," Or I have the data on the window of weakness."
"1565900","1567720"," Or why we should have a window of weakness. "
"1568240","1569620"," Or how deep it should go."
"1570900","1572480"," I'm doing this for that reason."
"1572940","1574020"," I'm not telling you. "
"1574500","1577620"," Hey, it's going to start on this date at this time at this price."
"1577820","1580280"," And then this is where the role is in that kind of stuff."
"1580820","1583760"," And oftentimes traders and investors confuse the two. "
"1584280","1587960"," And they are oftentimes on the wrong fucking side of this."
"1589820","1593860"," Because they're looking at the smart person with the data."
"1594500","1597940"," And saying well that person right there is telling me to expect a role. "
"1598500","1600240"," So I'm fucking smack short right now."
"1600240","1601980"," Or on the 18th or 19th."
"1602020","1602840"," What the fuck data is. "
"1603260","1604680"," You know, it involves deep."
"1604940","1606380"," And sure enough you can see it this morning."
"1606860","1608880"," And they're getting fucking bent over. "
"1609140","1611820"," Investors and stock traders."
"1612180","1614640"," So that's one of my key points in this program."
"1614640","1617480"," Is the reason I'm here with you. "
"1617840","1621500"," Every day is so that you as an investor and trader."
"1622160","1625060"," Can take that next step from I've read the books."
"1625340","1626100"," I've watched the videos. "
"1626200","1628100"," I went to the CME options."
"1628220","1630980"," Industry Council meet the YouTube videos."
"1631500","1632520"," I'm in the discord. "
"1632820","1634200"," I got all the tools out there."
"1634360","1636560"," I got map running and I got flow."
"1636780","1637260"," I'll go running. "
"1637480","1638800"," I got trade the news running."
"1639040","1639820"," I go shit running."
"1640080","1641100"," But I can't put it all together. "
"1641380","1642680"," It's normally because."
"1642680","1649620"," You haven't spent time with a day trader or a swing trader or an investor."
"1650880","1651020"," Right. "
"1651240","1653440"," So that's the missing piece normally."
"1654000","1658220"," Is that you get to trade alongside someone that's been doing this for a while."
"1658980","1660500"," And you put the pieces together. "
"1661100","1664180"," And what is actually important is that you can identify."
"1664940","1666060"," That it's there."
"1666740","1670460"," If it happens, you know what to do and until it happens. "
"1670920","1673000"," You know to trade the market in front of you."
"1673020","1676500"," It's a very key part to being successful."
"1677180","1683800"," That has nothing to do with data or what other people's motivations are for what they're putting"
"1683800","1684800"," out there for you to consume. "
"1685680","1687140"," Your job right now."
"1687460","1692660"," I know that if you're here, you're here to invest in trade this market up and down."
"1693340","1696620"," And if you look in your bank account right now and it's not large. "
"1697860","1699480"," We got some work to do together."
"1699720","1699820"," Right."
"1700300","1700820"," So. "
"1702800","1704080"," A lot of air."
"1708680","1714240"," So so that's my point on on data and versus or not just data."
"1714900","1716260"," You've got people out there. "
"1716340","1718120"," They have like you got people on Twitter."
"1718260","1719400"," They're in fin to it."
"1719780","1721080"," And they're professionals. "
"1721440","1721580"," Right."
"1722640","1726640"," They want to have a history of saying, Hey, look, this is Twitter presence."
"1727360","1733520"," You have media personalities, someone that wants to break into maybe being a reporter or something. "
"1733700","1733800"," Right."
"1733920","1737240"," And so they're writing media articles and they push it on fin to it."
"1737500","1740320"," You have people that are longtime Tesla investors. "
"1740560","1742880"," They've owned Tesla since it was $10."
"1743660","1745980"," So they're always trying to support Tesla."
"1746240","1748040"," It's bought their house paid off their college. "
"1748080","1749720"," It's put their kids through school."
"1750440","1753480"," Their motivations are different than your motivations."
"1754400","1759740"," This show is geared towards a losing investor, a losing trader. "
"1760320","1763940"," I only started this because I was tired of reading about."
"1764460","1766260"," I blew up a half million dollar account."
"1766660","1768700"," I blew up $100,000 account. "
"1769000","1770220"," I blew up $30,000."
"1770780","1774140"," I work every week and I blow up that that thousand bucks."
"1774220","1775100"," I make it my job. "
"1775620","1778880"," That's what this is geared towards trying to make you a winning trader and investor."
"1779500","1782060"," I don't care if you're a buyer, seller, whatever you are."
"1782460","1786900"," As a matter of fact, I use bulls and bears as a heel to lure you in so that you"
"1786900","1788840"," can find out what buyers and sellers are. "
"1789220","1793460"," Where supply and demand is and not be that bull or bear anymore."
"1794200","1796160"," Even if you are still a seller or a buyer."
"1796900","1799100"," So anyways, rant over on that stuff. "
"1799500","1801120"," But I want to clear the air on that stuff for you."
"1801600","1803100"," You can see this morning where we are."
"1803440","1806380"," We're trading $4.55.60. You can see the squeeze. "
"1806380","1809700"," This is the pain trade right now for today from yesterday."
"1809700","1810540"," You can see it."
"1810640","1811360"," That's how it happened. "
"1811780","1813200"," They all got schools out, right?"
"1814020","1815500"," They all got schools out here."
"1816140","1817800"," You know, it's a pain trade right there."
"1817860","1818280"," That hurts. "
"1818660","1819840"," There are people right now."
"1820060","1822900"," There are people right now on fucking fin to it, right?"
"1823620","1828600"," That went full fucking tits puts in the yesterday's clothes and they did not close them out."
"1828780","1830800"," A significant amount of retail traders. "
"1831220","1833100"," These are your fucking friends."
"1833100","1837740"," These are your like, even if you don't like them, you're a retailer."
"1838000","1838500"," You're not a professional. "
"1839260","1841180"," And they got hurt this morning."
"1841840","1843500"," And I don't want to see retailers get hurt."
"1843620","1847920"," I want to see retailers like selling together, buying together, and making money in general"
"1847920","1848320"," together. "
"1849260","1853460"," So I'm a little fucking hurt sometimes when I see a mantra."
"1854960","1858040"," Like the drum beat of what's going to happen."
"1858420","1861400"," And you know, wrong again, right?"
"1861400","1866080"," This happens on the way down to, but you know, wrong again, right?"
"1866840","1868600"," So this is not good to see. "
"1869040","1873480"," I'm assuming someone's watching this stream right now and they're fucking getting banged up right"
"1873480","1873820"," now."
"1874900","1879100"," You know, people out there that'll say the people out there say they're not or they're still short"
"1879100","1881240"," or they're going to carry this until it rolls."
"1882080","1883960"," You know, this fucking pain trade is on right now. "
"1884360","1885160"," This sucks."
"1886560","1888420"," So, you know, and I don't want to see this."
"1888640","1890000"," I don't want to see a retailer get hurt. "
"1890000","1893020"," My intent here is not for you to get hurt out there."
"1901730","1903310"," Yeah, yeah, that's the end result."
"1903590","1906230"," I want you to, I want you to like leave truthfully. "
"1906630","1912530"," If you never listen to me ever again, we do repetitive tool tool."
"1913350","1918290"," Like we are, we do repetitive trading here and you can apply this on a one minute, five minute, one"
"1918290","1919930"," hour, one day weekly."
"1920270","1920650"," I don't care. "
"1921630","1927930"," But hopefully after a month or three months or six months, if you never see me live again, you'll"
"1927930","1932290"," say, I've got these fucking 10 tools that I use this guy every day."
"1932430","1938190"," I know where the where the where the gambling is and where the not gambling is above and below"
"1938190","1938650"," consolidation."
"1939130","1941170"," I know where the bear and bull planes are. "
"1941290","1947190"," I know where the where the high guaranteed trade is where I can make the most money, make"
"1947190","1948230"," consistent trades."
"1948890","1950370"," All that kind of stuff, right?"
"1950530","1953730"," I want you guys to to walk away from this."
"1954150","1957850"," If you don't know me or see me ever live stream again for another five or ten years, you got"
"1957850","1958430"," those tools. "
"1958930","1960790"," Those are going to give you an edge over everybody else."
"1961710","1964830"," Yeah, and you're going to be able to teach those to somebody else as well."
"1965290","1968950"," So that grows over time and retailers become better traders and investors over time. "
"1972380","1973420"," Hell yeah, we are."
"1974520","1976040"," I love all you guys out there."
"1977040","1978100"," Every single one of you. "
"1980400","1982680"," What's my boy Oscar doing out there?"
"1983340","1984140"," I haven't checked."
"1984500","1985760"," I haven't checked them yet."
"1985920","1987220"," I haven't looked this morning to see. "
"1987960","1990060"," Oh, it's ready to rock right now, isn't it?"
"1990140","1991000"," It's ready to explode."
"1992800","1994600"," It's ready to explode."
"1995420","2000760"," There are like a bunch of tickers here today that are we have a bunch of tickers ready to move"
"2000760","2001480"," today. "
"2002120","2005620"," And you also saw some rotation today as well, right?"
"2005620","2007400"," We saw yesterday in the close."
"2007940","2010340"," We see it in the pre-market this morning."
"2010520","2015560"," There's a little bit of like, yeah, I'm going to get out of these high flyers and start pushing"
"2015560","2016380"," some money elsewhere. "
"2016820","2020080"," There's a little bit of a quiet migration going on, right?"
"2020500","2024060"," Sometimes you can see that migratory move inside the market."
"2024460","2026300"," Sometimes you saw it going to real estate."
"2026620","2032000"," You see it shuffles over to bonds and it shuffles over across to these beaten down stocks. "
"2032640","2034320"," And you can see it happening right now."
"2034320","2040840"," And what's a key part of that migration that I was going to say it on Twitter and I didn't"
"2040840","2041480"," want to say it."
"2042080","2044460"," It's not easy to sell the S&P 500. "
"2045120","2051120"," The S&P 500 is made up of so many sectors that as long as the money is still in"
"2051120","2053080"," the market, we're not risk off yet."
"2053719","2055620"," We know that risk off is not a correction."
"2056340","2061940"," Risk off is when money leaves, migrates out of the S&P 500. "
"2061940","2066440"," Like out of DJI, out of S&P 500, right?"
"2066560","2067060"," Completely."
"2067520","2071840"," Right now we're still seeing a migration inside of the S&P 500."
"2072400","2076100"," So when you see that migration taking place, it's a cue. "
"2076320","2082000"," It's like a Q, C-U-E, a Q to you that we were not in risk off."
"2082520","2085920"," That there's still a risk appetite inside of our stock market."
"2085920","2091820"," Even if we consolidate or distribute or correct, it's still not risk off. "
"2097040","2099320"," So Tesla, we're going to talk about Tesla."
"2099660","2100680"," All that shit's out of the way."
"2101200","2103540"," We have one more housekeeping thing to do. "
"2104780","2108200"," I want to address Tesla briefly with you, okay?"
"2108740","2110480"," We're going to definitely address Tesla here."
"2111160","2113000"," We're going to come up here and talk about Tesla for ER."
"2113000","2115560"," We're going to talk about where it is right now. "
"2116000","2118000"," Some expectations, that kind of stuff."
"2118960","2120720"," I love all you guys out there."
"2120820","2121340"," You know what?"
"2121740","2130600"," I never thought doing this with all of you would lead to some kind of drama and fintuant. "
"2131160","2133160"," Dude, all this stuff is good shit."
"2134420","2136180"," Dude, I'm making fucking money."
"2137520","2139860"," If you're making money, why is there drama?"
"2139860","2144840"," The only way to think that there's drama is that there's people losing money. "
"2145420","2146420"," Like, there has to be."
"2146900","2149720"," Now, we're going to talk about some stuff here with Tesla."
"2153060","2156900"," We slapped PT2 on Tesla just now from yesterday. "
"2158340","2159860"," So, let's talk about Tesla."
"2160700","2162760"," Dude, we're going to start fucking ripping some faces off."
"2162920","2163600"," This is going to get ugly. "
"2164580","2167480"," And we got 459-92 up there."
"2167580","2168380"," You know what that is, right?"
"2168380","2170620"," I don't know if we get there today."
"2170680","2174820"," I don't want to say it, but we're going to take a stab at it, right?"
"2174920","2176160"," I think I posted that on Fintuant. "
"2180060","2183360"," A little reversal candle here on Tesla."
"2186470","2188430"," Let's look at Tesla really quick."
"2190970","2196210"," Man, dude, like, you know, I'm not even in a position at this point. "
"2196210","2202070"," Like, I just wanted to want to be in a position right now, but I have to focus on you"
"2202070","2205450"," guys right now because I guess that's what it calls for."
"2206770","2208050"," Give me one second here."
"2208210","2211890"," So, hold on, let me fix that right there. "
"2214290","2217250"," Give it a day up to the gods today."
"2219030","2220490"," So, we're going to talk about Tesla."
"2224180","2226280"," This is PT2 from yesterday. "
"2227260","2228800"," I came up here and slapped this."
"2229360","2231600"," This is a previous pivot anyways."
"2232500","2234220"," So, you're going to expect that to be there. "
"2234520","2236360"," We're going to talk about more PTs for today."
"2236940","2237340"," So, there you go."
"2237420","2238880"," You got 297-46. "
"2239340","2240680"," I do want to say something to you."
"2240940","2247820"," All of these tools we talk about every day, they all apply to every ticker."
"2247820","2254080"," So, if we're trading above the 30 EMA right here, we're bullish, right, regardless. "
"2254420","2256480"," We come up and hit some resistance and bounce off it."
"2256560","2257500"," There's a pivot right there."
"2258140","2263040"," Like the stuff we do in S&P matters no matter what you're doing here, okay?"
"2264180","2266460"," We're going to talk about some stuff though. "
"2266720","2270040"," So, first thing we're going to do is we're going to look at Tesla here."
"2271580","2274500"," And I want you to look at a few things here."
"2274500","2275760"," So, I'm going to move some stuff around here. "
"2276300","2278480"," And I want to talk to you about Tesla specifically."
"2279220","2281880"," We have a $300 price target up here."
"2282080","2287100"," We know, I can tell you assuredly, that two things happen. "
"2287860","2290400"," Number one, I don't care what the ticker is."
"2291420","2301420"," If you're talking about an actual cash market ticker, it's easy to see where the"
"2301420","2302120"," algos are."
"2302120","2304760"," They really do sit on the 5s and 10s. "
"2305200","2307700"," So, whenever you're at, that grows exponentially."
"2308600","2313320"," So, you have a lot of bids on $100, right?"
"2313600","2313800"," $200."
"2314420","2318940"," Then your next largest bids on buying sell are on the 50s, right?"
"2319140","2324800"," So, you have $100 or let's say $100, big bids, $150. "
"2326060","2329440"," That's your next size down bids, $200, same as the $100, right?"
"2330300","2334920"," And then if you get down to like the 75s and then if you get down into the 10s, right?"
"2335160","2339760"," Like the 60s and the 70s and 80s and the 30s, 40s and 50s."
"2340060","2341300"," So, Tesla."
"2342660","2349540"," We already know that when you're getting close to a big round number, there's going to be auto"
"2349540","2349960"," selling. "
"2350680","2360160"," The second thing that we know is that Tesla's famous for having a price target and early sellers"
"2360160","2361300"," stepping in."
"2361620","2362720"," They did that here yesterday."
"2362980","2363400"," We got close. "
"2364360","2369520"," We got that 300 and they stepped right in and they slammed it down, right?"
"2370000","2372980"," So, we know that we're going to meet resistance here."
"2373740","2382960"," My point on Twitter this morning was, my point on Twitter this morning was that"
"2382960","2387800"," when we bought this down here, we got the confirmation, right?"
"2388420","2390700"," We started to take it up, right?"
"2391240","2396140"," We got the 156 down here and then even before that down at the 100, we, as a matter of"
"2396140","2401980"," fact, that morning of the 100, I wanted to hit that 96 or something and I didn't get it."
"2402420","2403720"," And then that, I didn't get it. "
"2403740","2404400"," I was pissed off."
"2404580","2407780"," I was like, nope, I'm going to wait for the open and see if it bread bars down."
"2407940","2408500"," I'm going to grab it. "
"2408800","2409660"," It ran away from me."
"2410160","2411880"," Eventually, it chased and jumped on it."
"2413020","2414860"," Down here, we did the same thing, right?"
"2414860","2418900"," So, you should have been long for all of this, right?"
"2419340","2420380"," Came back down here. "
"2421060","2424060"," Tag 240 should have gotten long there again, right?"
"2424760","2427780"," And so, my point behind Tesla is multi-fold."
"2428140","2434700"," Number one, when you're listening to people out there tell you things like, why are you not bullish"
"2434700","2437240"," or why are you not beating the drums right now?"
"2437760","2438780"," I have a responsibility."
"2439220","2440100"," I'm going to be honest with you. "
"2440340","2442300"," I have a responsibility to myself."
"2443640","2451920"," The way that I live my life, you're never going to see me out there saying something publicly about"
"2451920","2455580"," something like Tesla and being like, you should buy right here."
"2456160","2460940"," You do hear me publicly say things like, yeah, put risk on right here. "
"2461100","2462480"," Yeah, put risk on right here."
"2463080","2468580"," As we get up here into these levels, this is not the place to initiate risk."
"2468580","2475040"," If you're going to leave a runner's on or you're in from way down here, you're in it 100 bucks"
"2475040","2479780"," or you're in it 150 or 240 or whatever it is, that's a lot different. "
"2480180","2485160"," If you're in it $10, a lot different than a lot of the drum beating that you hear, the drum"
"2485160","2487980"," beaters out there are in like right here."
"2489320","2490920"," They're long calls right here."
"2491560","2494720"," They literally never got long down here. "
"2495320","2496020"," They never do."
"2496780","2498380"," They're always up here getting long."
"2498680","2499580"," This is why they have jobs. "
"2499980","2502580"," I assure you, they're getting long, always on peeps, always."
"2503360","2507320"," And then they don't, they like, you know, paper hand, they get, they get sold out, then it rips up."
"2507580","2508620"," I know the story. "
"2509260","2510640"," I've been doing this too long to not know."
"2510780","2511200"," That's the truth."
"2512580","2513820"," But you're never going to get me. "
"2514020","2518820"," You never ever, you're never going to get me up here telling you to initiate like all of your"
"2518820","2522600"," paycheck and on this trade, uh, into the close."
"2522600","2524480"," I'm all, are, into the, into 300."
"2524880","2528500"," Even if we go up there, even if we go to 305, 315, I don't give a fuck. "
"2528980","2530880"," You're not going to hear me, uh, saying that."
"2531100","2533240"," I'm always the guy, always known for this."
"2533640","2535240"," I get screamed at by test levels. "
"2535900","2539680"," Dude, I, dude, when we were at 1500, we were trade, trading up to 1500."
"2540000","2541500"," People were fucking living at me."
"2542100","2543640"," Uh, I'm like, dude, I'm out. "
"2543860","2544860"," I'm like cashing out."
"2545680","2545920"," I'm done."
"2546160","2546540"," I'm out. "
"2546980","2547500"," I'm walking away."
"2547940","2548920"," And it did roll over."
"2549580","2550680"," Uh, and people did get caught. "
"2550680","2553620"," People got banged up, uh, when that happens."
"2553940","2555140"," So, Tesla."
"2556100","2557840"," And there's another point I want to make to you. "
"2558020","2559360"," I want to show you guys something here."
"2559980","2562040"," Tesla trades on its daily velo."
"2562340","2562440"," Okay. "
"2563620","2565000"," I want to explain that to you."
"2565640","2570100"," Uh, so I want to explain to you when, when, when Tesla's down and it's velo down and you see"
"2570100","2573640"," it, uh, it's start, it's time to start buying."
"2574460","2575560"," I want you to see it right here. "
"2576080","2578280"," When Tesla's down here, it's time to start buying."
"2578540","2580140"," You see that, that big dip down there?"
"2581060","2584500"," And, uh, just coming into where Tesla is right now, right?"
"2584940","2585900"," We know that it's bullish."
"2586120","2587580"," We have the big crossover here, right?"
"2587980","2590780"," We got the weekly coming up, big weekly cross right now. "
"2591140","2592880"," Do I think Tesla can scream higher today?"
"2593000","2593280"," Yes."
"2593400","2595300"," Do I think they can scream higher after the close?"
"2595520","2595680"," Yes."
"2596120","2597300"," But I don't know your positioning. "
"2597860","2600920"," Am I, am I condoning you starting a position today?"
"2601200","2601540"," Fuck no."
"2602140","2604280"," Your starting a position was way down here."
"2604480","2605060"," Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"2605820","2609560"," And we are a little long in the tooth in velo right now. "
"2609560","2612180"," If you're like, when can I start a Tesla position?"
"2612580","2613140"," We go over this."
"2613280","2614600"," We've been going over this for years now."
"2615020","2615840"," Fuck in years. "
"2616740","2619600"," Uh, it's when we come back down in velo down here."
"2620140","2620440"," Okay."
"2621320","2623520"," That's, that's when you should be starting your position. "
"2624140","2625480"," I really don't give a fuck."
"2626060","2628220"," Uh, that you're scared when we're down there."
"2628600","2629620"," I don't give a fuck. "
"2629800","2631860"," And as a matter of fact, you guys on stream all the time."
"2632520","2637860"," I will always come in to stream and we'll be like bleeding into a close on a smaller time frame,"
"2637940","2639580"," a five minute time frame and a daily chart."
"2639960","2645040"," And I will ask you guys and I will poll you and say, are you closing your shorts here?"
"2646500","2647740"," And I get straight. "
"2647980","2652120"," People just, now these days people just stop and they're like, fuck, I gotta close my short."
"2652660","2653840"," Fuck, I gotta close my puts."
"2654280","2659440"," Cause I rarely ever ask that question unless I know that on that time frame, this is a bottom. "
"2660300","2664180"," And so, you know, when we're down here, you know what the consensus is."
"2664460","2665420"," I'm not fucking buying."
"2665660","2666260"," It's too risky. "
"2666900","2670520"," But this is where you actually put, you have to put risk on this market."
"2670940","2674880"," That is where the risk gets put on when we're down there."
"2675480","2677920"," So is this the time to long Tesla?"
"2678280","2679200"," No, I'm sorry. "
"2679460","2679760"," It's not."
"2680100","2681100"," It's not what you want to hear."
"2681340","2683660"," I know you want the chair leading and all that kind of stuff. "
"2684660","2686240"," And where do I want to buy Tesla?"
"2686580","2686700"," Right?"
"2686980","2688400"," I want to buy Tesla at fucking 270."
"2689140","2691100"," I want to buy Tesla down below."
"2691660","2692340"," Believe it or not. "
"2692680","2693620"," At two thirty."
"2694040","2694780"," That's where I want to buy it."
"2695600","2698900"," I would hope and wish and pray as a bull. "
"2699320","2701320"," But I get a chance to buy down here."
"2701720","2704040"," I know you don't want to hear that, but that's what I want."
"2704260","2705660"," Like you want to ask me what I want?"
"2705980","2706840"," That's what I fucking want. "
"2707340","2708880"," I fucking want a deal."
"2709700","2710980"," Always want to deal."
"2711460","2714000"," Always want to buy a dip on Tesla. "
"2714340","2715340"," Now saying that."
"2718160","2719300"," Saying all of that."
"2720820","2725340"," If you wanted to start a position on Tesla, right?"
"2725820","2727440"," We have rules here, right?"
"2728080","2728800"," What are those rules?"
"2730160","2732320"," Any successful test of the hourly?"
"2733100","2734480"," Take a long, right?"
"2734840","2735480"," You see it right here?"
"2735880","2735900"," Boom. "
"2736140","2736660"," Take a long."
"2737000","2737100"," Boom."
"2737440","2737880"," Take a long. "
"2738780","2742120"," So what are you looking for in some measure of safety?"
"2743380","2744640"," Heading into the end of the day."
"2746880","2751300"," You're hoping for a retest here at some point."
"2752080","2755200"," Two ninety three and a half to go higher. "
"2756780","2757960"," That's what you're looking for."
"2758800","2761580"," If it breaks below, you have a stop that you manage, right?"
"2762280","2762980"," It breaks below."
"2763300","2764000"," It squeezes up. "
"2764100","2764920"," It starts to drown."
"2765600","2767340"," You're out of your trade and we start going down."
"2767540","2768400"," No big deal for you. "
"2768620","2768680"," None."
"2769540","2770900"," No big deal for you."
"2771460","2774100"," Otherwise, what is your trade today on Tesla?"
"2774100","2777280"," And your trade is, hold on, give me a second here. "
"2778640","2780380"," What is your trade on Tesla today?"
"2781160","2784540"," If you're on a five minute chart, we already have rules, right?"
"2785320","2787480"," They're going to come back down, test the one minute here."
"2789160","2792880"," We right now have a bar that's successful, right?"
"2793180","2798520"," So if you want to look at the time, it's 10, 50, it's 10, 10."
"2799220","2803380"," Sellers have five more minutes to get below two ninety five forty three. "
"2803380","2808760"," And you already know that we have to break above the previous high, right?"
"2809660","2815820"," So after 10, 15, between 10, 15, 10, 30, we need to get a new high on two ninety seven,"
"2815960","2816960"," not thirty nine, right?"
"2817360","2818840"," So you already know these rules here."
"2819100","2821920"," So if you're wondering, hey, Cap, should I take a long or something?"
"2822560","2823620"," You already have the rules."
"2823780","2826380"," It doesn't matter what I say. "
"2827400","2828540"," Okay, it really doesn't."
"2829420","2831340"," You can trade this up as long as you want."
"2831340","2832380"," You know where to put your stops. "
"2832720","2837600"," You know that there might be even an opportunity to trade down and pick it up at two ninety three"
"2837600","2838200"," eighty eight."
"2838220","2840260"," If you want to be more conservative, right?"
"2840480","2841660"," You already know what it is."
"2841760","2843480"," What a bear cross looks like, right?"
"2844560","2845240"," Well, I hear. "
"2846520","2850220"," You already know we start getting risk off on on a daily chart, right?"
"2850400","2851340"," You get that cross, right?"
"2852100","2853160"," You got a failure down here."
"2853240","2856420"," You got another failure here tries to come back up, right?"
"2857540","2861600"," Round them again to the downside and you know that you can't be long there."
"2861800","2865680"," We have these tools in our stream day in day out. "
"2866620","2870420"," So when you ask me him a bullshunt Tesla, fuck yeah, bullshunt Tesla."
"2871520","2873180"," Yes, I'm bullshunt Tesla."
"2874240","2878220"," I talked to you last week about what to expect. "
"2878500","2882600"," And sure enough, what I harp on it again and again in the next day."
"2882880","2884940"," Boom, you get your first truck delivery, right?"
"2884940","2888080"," Months ago, I told you about this on fin to it, right?"
"2888400","2893020"," Talk to you about this late night two three in the morning and I would delete those tweets and"
"2893020","2894760"," Tesla gangs talking about it, right?"
"2895200","2896420"," And sure enough, that's happening."
"2896940","2900260"," So let's go through some Tesla stuff right now because I promise that I would. "
"2907380","2908900"," I'd say I talk about Tesla."
"2909400","2911080"," Let's talk about some rules here in Tesla."
"2911720","2915660"," These are not set in stone, but these are the things that I've learned over the years. "
"2916400","2925240"," Number one, if we don't get something deliverable at this point on ERs, we get a good ER, not good"
"2925240","2925500"," enough."
"2926560","2928420"," That's a fucking rule, write it down."
"2929160","2930280"," You don't get something delivered. "
"2931240","2933100"," Matter of fact, I was talking to Joey Dunn at this morning."
"2933260","2936400"," He said, oh, there was that one time where they turned profitable and we went up."
"2936860","2938080"," I was like, but that's still deliverable. "
"2938080","2941000"," You need something delivered with Tesla."
"2941480","2947800"," Whenever we have Tesla days and they talk about promises of free energy and stuff like that,"
"2948720","2952060"," Tesla's the kind of stock where if you ain't fucking delivering, it ain't going up."
"2952660","2955960"," No one's that that ship has sailed of promising shit. "
"2956500","2958180"," So you got to see deliverables."
"2958260","2960060"," You got to see a truck come off the line."
"2960500","2961960"," You got to see profit. "
"2962300","2967200"," You got to see things that are unexpected, unknown, not priced in."
"2967200","2971700"," Or we're priced in and then we reprice because they weren't delivered."
"2972000","2973200"," That's what we did with Tesla, right?"
"2973580","2974320"," Repriced it. "
"2974740","2977580"," We had that the pricing of the Cybertruck didn't get delivered."
"2978020","2980760"," Got repriced and now supposedly it's coming."
"2981860","2986540"," So my expectations are over the next three quarters. "
"2986840","2987460"," I want to say two."
"2988020","2990400"," I think it's between this Q3 and Q4."
"2990780","2994900"," You're going to get one of these ERs where there is an announcement. "
"2995440","3000740"," I had another guy into it say, no, no, no, you have to trade to five or six hundred."
"3000900","3001940"," Then you'll get the split."
"3002140","3004060"," And I'm like, no, that's not guaranteed. "
"3004640","3005840"," You could get a split announcement."
"3006820","3007900"," That could be it."
"3007980","3012140"," And then it would trade to six, seven hundred bucks, eight hundred bucks, thousand bucks, something"
"3012140","3012820"," fucking crazy. "
"3013820","3015040"," I think that's a possibility."
"3015640","3019880"," I think FSC four or five could be a possibility."
"3020060","3021960"," And the Cybertruck was the other one. "
"3021960","3026360"," And sure enough, we see them rolling off the line at this point."
"3026780","3031120"," Now, if their earnings don't miss, there's going to be discussion or questions about the"
"3031120","3031680"," Cybertruck."
"3032120","3034400"," They're going to be looking for answers in this ER. "
"3035700","3040220"," We're going to talk about some, we're going to chart out Tesla's levels for today briefly."
"3040880","3042960"," We're going to go over the expected move for the close today."
"3043980","3047440"," And we're going to go over what my expectations are for what Tesla does. "
"3047760","3048520"," Now, here's another rule."
"3048620","3050600"," I gave you a couple, one or two rules already, right?"
"3050600","3053500"," I'm going to give you another rule about Tesla's ERs."
"3054100","3059460"," If you don't get those things from Tesla, you don't get something that's unexpected, unknown,"
"3060400","3061900"," deliverable right now. "
"3062740","3068460"," The other thing about Tesla is dealers take all of your bets typically into their ER."
"3068820","3069900"," They get you excited here."
"3070200","3070620"," Watch my cursor. "
"3071440","3073080"," I'm going to put the book map back up here."
"3073940","3076820"," They get you all excited in here, right?"
"3076980","3078660"," They get you excited in the pre market, right?"
"3078660","3079160"," Woo hoo."
"3079240","3079820"," Yeah, woo hoo. "
"3079900","3081000"," Going up here, woo hoo."
"3081360","3083500"," And you're just loading the fuck up for their ER."
"3084040","3086380"," And then what they do is they trap you into this. "
"3087100","3090040"," And then you walk the plank into their actual ER."
"3092200","3095940"," Going back to when the trade was, it was a long time ago, it wasn't today."
"3096720","3101940"," So you get locked in, they burn you down and oftentimes if you don't get it deliverable, even if"
"3101940","3110000"," you get a good ER, what happens is they'll trade the implied move on that next expiry, both sides. "
"3110840","3112820"," And then you get your actual move afterwards."
"3114140","3118260"," Not until they've torched both sides of that chain."
"3120080","3127060"," And a microcosm, you'll see this on event days on the S&P 500. "
"3127840","3129700"," They won't hit the upper target."
"3129960","3131080"," They won't hit the lower target."
"3131340","3132480"," They'll just barely miss them. "
"3132480","3136100"," And they start reprising the event ball crush, right?"
"3136320","3142640"," The implied ball goes away and then they reprice all your options on you and you get fucked."
"3143320","3144600"," So spreads are your friend."
"3145040","3149800"," If you're directionally committed to us going up, time is your friend. "
"3150640","3154660"," The only time that doesn't work is when something is delivered that's unknown."
"3155680","3159040"," If you have something like, oh, by the way, we're doing a stock split."
"3166600","3170380"," Then nobody knew that will need to be priced in. "
"3171360","3173280"," The dealers will then chase."
"3174180","3178680"," Instead of going against you in the trade, they will actually follow you in the trade."
"3179560","3184380"," And you'll see the price of Tesla sky rocket into the next day and in the bell ring. "
"3184660","3187640"," And it'll start ripping up higher and higher and higher and higher."
"3187640","3192060"," So, ball crush, event crush, right?"
"3192560","3193780"," Real things out there."
"3196280","3202080"," We're going to go with 297.06. It's the first one right here for today. "
"3204240","3205120"," Broke through it."
"3205960","3207400"," This is actually PT one."
"3218980","3222640"," So, if you are, if you, let's take this at face value. "
"3222640","3229760"," If you're bullish on Tesla today, the easiest trade is likely going to be a call spread."
"3230980","3234620"," Same thing for being bearish on Tesla today."
"3244200","3249460"," If you are like, well, I want to put a trade on a no news. "
"3251000","3257040"," The only thing worth trading is a lot for a very small amount of money that's way outside the"
"3257040","3257260"," money."
"3257260","3265900"," You're expecting like, not 300, but like 350, 360, 370, like a giant fucking move."
"3266480","3269700"," Maybe not that high, 325, 350, something like that. "
"3274100","3275000"," I'm going to say it."
"3275240","3277300"," I just got a text from James Rowan."
"3277400","3278600"," Maybe we can try to have him on today. "
"3279820","3282560"," Well, let me see if I can contact James Rowan and get him on the show today."
"3286280","3287400"," Hold on a second here."
"3288820","3292680"," I know James, I'm probably going to, you know how this is going to go, brother. "
"3293380","3297000"," So, just right up here, we're going to make this one right here."
"3297600","3298520"," Make this one thick."
"3298700","3299760"," I'm sitting at James on today. "
"3301180","3301940"," Hold on here."
"3302340","3303080"," PT three."
"3306830","3308730"," So, here's your price targets for today. "
"3309730","3311170"," 306, 32."
"3312670","3314730"," Next thing we're going to do is, I'm going to hold on a second here."
"3321990","3323690"," You know what else is fascinating too?"
"3324150","3325450"," Just going back to attribution. "
"3326890","3330150"," I'll fucking tell you what, my ass was burned on that this morning."
"3330650","3331790"," Because you know what it made me want to do?"
"3332510","3335310"," It made me want to fucking, it made me want to start fucking."
"3336150","3338330"," You're like, I've never had a sponsor. "
"3339110","3340630"," I've never reached out to anyone."
"3340990","3341470"," I've reached out."
"3341550","3344110"," I think people have reached out to me. "
"3344110","3344930"," I've never had a sponsor."
"3345030","3346630"," I've never had any sponsored content."
"3346930","3347650"," I can. "
"3348490","3349250"," Sponsored tools."
"3349690","3350790"," I've never done any of that."
"3351190","3352790"," And now it makes me want to do it. "
"3353550","3357330"," Because you know, they'll pay me thousands of dollars every week."
"3357890","3363270"," You know, to pump spot gamma or book map or trend spider or whatever it is."
"3363370","3364750"," I don't, you know, it doesn't matter if the company is. "
"3366010","3367070"," It's just so bizarre."
"3371800","3372760"," So bizarre."
"3373340","3374400"," So fucking bizarre. "
"3374400","3379080"," Like the complications of some of this stuff is like, huh?"
"3379560","3380260"," You're saying what?"
"3383150","3385610"," I need to start, I need to start that monetizing."
"3386970","3388630"," Then people can really hate me."
"3389010","3389910"," People hate you for anything. "
"3390550","3392210"," It's like fucking so fucked up."
"3394090","3396330"," So let's talk about Tesla."
"3398330","3401330"," And Clyde move for the 21st. "
"3402310","3404090"," Three, fourteen, fifty six."
"3410080","3411360"," Hey, there it is right there."
"3411460","3412320"," Surprise, surprise. "
"3413860","3414340"," Docker."
"3414860","3415080"," See it?"
"3416460","3417480"," So right up here."
"3418360","3419480"," How's that spooze doing?"
"3419720","3420820"," Ripping faces off, right?"
"3422020","3426240"," There's an implied move right there to the upside for the 21st. "
"3426240","3429160"," Downside implied move, two seventy seven oh six."
"3436810","3437610"," Right."
"3438010","3438550"," Wait a minute. "
"3441600","3442800"," Right about there."
"3443660","3447680"," So for ER today, this is the implied move right here."
"3451540","3456940"," And the hourly trigger is at two ninety one seventy eight. "
"3466420","3467500"," Right here."
"3468400","3475750"," So right here, this should help you today."
"3482960","3487100"," Especially if this is where the dealers are pricing in. "
"3487680","3492060"," You break above three fourteen sixty seven, you're going to start squeezing your faces off."
"3492580","3495000"," So OTM calls up here if you want to run lotos."
"3495420","3497600"," To the downside, the same thing applies. "
"3498100","3502840"," If we get a bad ER and then we start trading below this, now you have to hold below this."
"3503120","3504920"," You can tag it and then come back down."
"3504920","3511060"," But if you break above it and hold and start to move higher, that's when dealers will, dealers will"
"3511060","3511340"," chase. "
"3512040","3514660"," Same thing down below here at this two seventy six."
"3515560","3516000"," Okay."
"3516080","3519300"," So let me just draw that out better for you so you understand what I'm trying to say to you. "
"3519680","3521760"," You're going to get your, let's see if a bad ER."
"3522720","3523240"," You drop down."
"3523860","3526280"," You need to go Bam Bam Bam and start going this way. "
"3526440","3527880"," And then dealers will actually chase."
"3528480","3529480"," They won't counter that trade."
"3530140","3534620"," They will counter the trade anywhere above this range right here for you. "
"3534620","3535260"," On Tesla."
"3535940","3537740"," And we'll update this end of the day."
"3538260","3540960"," And I'm going to check one more thing with, uh, with Tesla. "
"3543080","3545200"," And, uh, hold on a second here."
"3548930","3553770"," Uh, let me see if I can get a implied move on expected move."
"3554990","3555510"," Ready?"
"3556050","3556570"," Expected move. "
"3557230","3561150"," Uh, plus or minus six point four percent."
"3561850","3564410"," So let me just check and see what that is."
"3564410","3567050"," And we'll get some other targets for you right now. "
"3580970","3581730"," Uh, 302."
"3582590","3583430"," Not much movement."
"3583750","3584210"," So I'm not right. "
"3586690","3587450"," Hold on a second."
"3587610","3587950"," Get that wrong."
"3595930","3603000"," It's roughly three fourteen. "
"3603520","3605620"," So yep, this, this actually lines up just fine."
"3605780","3607660"," This is the implied move to the upside right here."
"3608480","3609320"," And then downside. "
"3610600","3611300"," The implied move."
"3617910","3619750"," Is a two eighty two."
"3619750","3621890"," So slightly higher somewhere in here. "
"3622910","3624690"," Uh, it's roughly here."
"3625130","3625890"," Applied move right here."
"3630980","3632180"," Applied ball maybe. "
"3635960","3638820"," And the other, the upside target is right around here."
"3642000","3644600"," Or, uh, which I say earnings expected move."
"3652230","3653830"," Six point four percent. "
"3654470","3656730"," In either direction is the, uh."
"3661600","3663040"," Applied ball would be new options."
"3663060","3663500"," So. "
"3668550","3668990"," Shit."
"3669170","3671190"," I think it's two eighty two and change right about there."
"3674860","3676900"," So that's it for today on Tesla. "
"3677660","3680720"," Now if you want to know what my thoughts are in Tesla, I've told you, right?"
"3681280","3683660"," I also like to trade these things with personally."
"3683660","3686440"," My favorite way to trade."
"3686720","3687100"," Look at this. "
"3687160","3687920"," Look at Spy, baby."
"3688180","3688660"," Come on Spy."
"3688920","3689140"," Do it. "
"3689560","3694200"," My favorite way to trade these things would be small auto trade."
"3694540","3696040"," Up or down, whatever you've decided."
"3696480","3698780"," I also like, uh, I also like. "
"3700100","3701880"," Spreads in both directions."
"3702340","3704320"," So I like running a, um, strangle."
"3705180","3710400"," Not with, uh, like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do a strangle with like, um, Tesla calls and puts. "
"3710400","3713920"," I do like a call spread and a put spread and see if we can hit both sides."
"3715220","3716520"," That's some points, right?"
"3716760","3718840"," That that following two weeks or three weeks out."
"3720160","3722280"," Another favorite of mine is to. "
"3723660","3724260"," Synthetically."
"3726720","3728500"," Uh, uh, these, these stocks."
"3729700","3732920"," So you have Netflix today and you have Tesla today. "
"3733700","3739720"," You go into, uh, QQQ's or SPY and you wait until."
"3740220","3743300"," There's a vault or there's a panic drop at the bell."
"3743820","3746080"," You scoop up some calls if you're bullish. "
"3746840","3750680"," And the initial report comes out and boom, it skyrockets."
"3751760","3753500"," The Spy RQ's goes to the moon."
"3753880","3756260"," You close out that trade, you pocket that cash. "
"3757420","3760740"," And then they do their guidance later in the night time and the stock drops back down and you're"
"3760740","3762420"," not locked into calls for next day."
"3763340","3764620"," Dude, you just made your money."
"3764760","3766580"," You just, you just synthetically traded. "
"3766580","3769240"," Uh, Netflix, Tesla."
"3769760","3771040"," Netflix been flying, right?"
"3771640","3775380"," Let's say it was like one more push up on Netflix and it gets sold off by the open the"
"3775380","3775740"," next day."
"3775800","3777860"," You're in and out for 15 minutes. "
"3778560","3780740"," Between 4 p.m. and 4.15 in the afternoon."
"3781780","3783340"," Uh, so just be aware of that."
"3783560","3788300"," Last thing that I like to do on earnings actual dates is not fucking trade it. "
"3788980","3790440"," The reaction trade."
"3791140","3791880"," It's even better."
"3792620","3794480"," You squeeze up, right?"
"3794760","3796140"," It's opened up nice and high. "
"3796140","3797600"," You short that shit into the ground."
"3798020","3801220"," Blast down after earnings report."
"3801620","3806680"," You wait until the 21st is done and you buy some calls and you get a nice move higher, right?"
"3807400","3810580"," So that'd be the last, the last option that I really like as well. "
"3817310","3817790"," Synthetic."
"3819390","3820390"," I like book map."
"3820610","3820970"," I love it. "
"3821130","3822250"," I've got it on right now."
"3822770","3823570"," I love book map."
"3826440","3828260"," I love the dome on book map. "
"3829900","3833920"," Can you guys see a little white box popping up on your video of me?"
"3834540","3836560"," Is there a little white box popping up when I move?"
"3836920","3838640"," Do you see a white box on your screen?"
"3839580","3843080"," So if I make a quick movement here, do you see like a white box popping up?"
"3844500","3845120"," You do?"
"3845440","3846680"," Okay, I got to change the settings."
"3847140","3850760"," Somehow I've got the settings shown up here."
"3852740","3854300"," I guess I got to do that another time. "
"3858250","3858770"," Spy."
"3859510","3861690"," Now above R1."
"3862970","3865530"," Once I get spied, go ahead and back to Spy real quick. "
"3868200","3869260"," Look at that."
"3869580","3870300"," Top of the world, Ma."
"3874320","3875660"," Hang in dong. "
"3876780","3878320"," Boom, what happened right here?"
"3878960","3881360"," Boom, what happened here?"
"3882060","3882800"," Support, right?"
"3884000","3884660"," See it?"
"3886060","3887340"," Fairly easy to see, right?"
"3887520","3887880"," You see it?"
"3889380","3891720"," You see the consolidation trade right there?"
"3892520","3894300"," Draw that through that line earlier."
"3895580","3895660"," Right?"
"3896200","3897020"," Bam, bam, bam."
"3897140","3897540"," What do we do?"
"3899060","3901280"," Bought right off the 6 CMA. "
"3901600","3904000"," Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham."
"3904000","3904700"," Wham, what do we get?"
"3905340","3907000"," We got a new high, right?"
"3908120","3910380"," Come back down now defending R1."
"3912260","3914560"," Some real solid rage right here. "
"3915660","3918160"," If you're looking for another buy-in."
"3918740","3924200"," Oh, I love seeing this shit."
"3930040","3931180"," Right in here. "
"3932440","3934380"," You're definitely coming back down here."
"3934680","3936040"," They're pissed off right now."
"3938280","3939580"," They're definitely pissed. "
"3942400","3943880"," Spoo's hanging dong right now."
"3955940","3956820"," Hold on."
"3956900","3959400"," I forgot to do my customization today. "
"3959980","3960820"," Hold on a second here."
"3960900","3961640"," Not members only."
"3962220","3962660"," Done. "
"3966660","3968720"," Should we open it up to the public today?"
"3968820","3969720"," Let's open it up to the public."
"3969720","3971220"," How about this?"
"3971360","3973000"," For today, it's earnings day for Tesla."
"3974880","3976940"," Anyone can comment today. "
"3977240","3980500"," If it gets too crazy in here, I'll shut it back off again."
"3980700","3981100"," How about that?"
"3983400","3984280"," I will."
"3984460","3986600"," I'll do it just for today. "
"3987440","3990980"," Every once in a while, we'll open up the chat to anyone to comment."
"3992800","3994940"," For today, not anybody."
"3995260","3995440"," Hold on. "
"3995560","3998300"," Hold on one second here."
"3998300","3998920"," I can't do..."

"4001840","4003060"," We don't want the..."
"4003060","4003540"," How about this?"
"4004320","4005860"," I'm going to switch it to subscribers. "
"4007220","4010420"," So I don't want to do anyone because then the Russian bots come in and the scammers."
"4011000","4011580"," So here's the deal."

"4366450","4367350"," He's a moderator too. "
"4368030","4368850"," Don't fuck this up."
"4368950","4373630"," If you're a moderator, you can't be getting all bold up and bear it up inside the chat."
"4373790","4374330"," You're going to be sober. "
"4377670","4381210"," Yeah, you can, what I mean sober like that."
"4382490","4388390"," Spoons right now coming down to check the 30 EMA on a five minute chart right now."

"4401010","4402070"," I think we're going to go lower."
"4402310","4405950"," So I think we're going to lose this right here. "

"4436210","4440210"," If you're going to buy this dip right now, you know the rules, right?"
"4442210","4444510"," If you don't know, I think you know the rules. "
"4444730","4445910"," You have to go over the rules."

"4646480","4648520"," Top is 299 92."
"4648700","4649900"," Just be careful of that right there. "

"4710140","4710980"," I was watching."
"4710980","4715260"," I was watching back here and I'm like, dude, Dixie's fucking ripping. "
"4715560","4717640"," But dude, the NDX just took off."
"4718180","4719860"," So that is the buy level right there."
"4720420","4721900"," So we didn't get a capitulation. "
"4722280","4723780"," Cappy didn't get his cheap calls."

"4762480","4764100"," No, no, no, no, no. "
"4764240","4765240"," Don't be asking about."
"4765520","4766420"," All right, here's the rules."
"4774390","4778170"," We're not doing stocks or Bitcoin or FTS today. "
"4778870","4781070"," It's like stocks that I can say."
"4781230","4782590"," I'm not going to comment on that stuff."
"4783730","4784470"," Not today. "

"4793070","4793390"," That's it. "
"4794030","4794590"," That's it."
"4796170","4797350"," Time out for you."
"4799090","4799910"," Time out. "
"4802050","4803190"," You got to time out."
"4803330","4803630"," Just easy."

"4812640","4813600"," I love CLFT."
"4813860","4814220"," You know that."
"4816200","4817780"," You're on just a quick time out. "
"4819880","4823920"," Like you can't do like stocks with like a million shares."
"4824780","4826880"," Can't do stocks that run for like two bucks."
"4827880","4831280"," We're not going to do any launching NFTs, launching crypto. "
"4831920","4832720"," We're not doing that here."
"4832900","4833940"," I got a prison for that shit."
"4833940","4835740"," Not talking about it. "
"4840000","4844320"," Yeah, I put him in a time out."
"4844420","4844840"," I like him."
"4845040","4848160"," I don't know who he is, but we're not doing any fucking pumping. "
"4848300","4850220"," Dude, do not follow that guy."
"4850300","4851220"," Whatever he's talking about."
"4851380","4852800"," Don't don't fucking follow him. "
"4853900","4854960"," Do not."
"4855300","4855760"," BRZ."
"4856000","4856380"," Baby. "
"4859870","4860430"," BRZ."
"4863330","4863890"," Okay."
"4864390","4864530"," So. "
"4865770","4867190"," We're done here for this moment."
"4867390","4868650"," This part of the loop."
"4868930","4871010"," We just two seconds are going to check up on something here. "
"4885760","4886460"," Oh, dude."
"4890720","4917180"," Well, I"
"4917180","4918280"," got to look through some stuff here."
"4918460","4919360"," What's going on?"
"4919600","4920860"," How's Fintuit doing today?"
"4921400","4922320"," How's your favorite?"
"4927050","4929250"," How's the how's Fintuit doing this morning?"
"4929250","4929750"," Let me know. "
"4930250","4932510"," It looks like everybody's got me on mute this morning."
"4932770","4935070"," All the bears have me on mute on Fintuit this morning."
"4937690","4939310"," Where did they all go?"
"4954610","4956530"," The BGL held again. "
"4957670","4959710"," Janae Marcus just made a comment."
"4959710","4961390"," They just said the BGL."
"4969730","4972210"," Fucking Janae Marcus with the BGL. "
"4973610","4982760"," Oh, man, dude."
"4983020","4983540"," Janae Marcus."
"4983880","4984340"," I love him. "
"4996490","4997670"," Oh, boy, dude."
"4997910","4999030"," I shoot you not."
"4999370","4999390"," Sorry. "
"5000170","5001770"," I'm just taking a moment to go through Fintuit."
"5001950","5002450"," Fintuit's like."
"5003110","5003970"," Fintuit's pissed. "
"5009050","5014190"," Hold on one second here."
"5033310","5034290"," Oh, man, dude."
"5034530","5036150"," Pissed off Fintuit right now. "
"5036890","5037850"," Angry Fintuit."
"5038250","5041230"," When I don't have any tweets in my feed, I know something's wrong."
"5046160","5048180"," Yeah, rage selling and coming definitely. "
"5049440","5050420"," Teddy bear tavern."
"5050920","5052800"," Did I post that on Fintuit?"
"5055920","5056400"," Yeah."
"5056740","5058080"," I saw the CDNA trade. "
"5059080","5059560"," Definitely."
"5059800","5060340"," That's been there."
"5060480","5062000"," Everybody's been talking about that one, right?"
"5062240","5064020"," And it finally paid off for people today. "
"5070970","5073110"," Man, I'm not going to say anything unfintuit."
"5073130","5074570"," I'm going to be cool on Fintuit right now."
"5087900","5088340"," Okay. "
"5088660","5094940"," So we have the successful retest here on the 2730MA, whatever you're using out there."
"5096220","5097740"," We know what this means, right?"
"5097920","5098960"," We got the successful retest."
"5099000","5110260"," We're going to be looking for this for move higher here to try to trade $47.82. 4 "
"5110260","5114600",".56 C's now trading $0.72.73. I didn't take the trade. "
"5123040","5124540"," Let me know if you're long in the chat."
"5124720","5125300"," I didn't take it."
"5126180","5126600"," Yeah. "
"5126740","5128040"," I see the VIX climbing in the background."
"5130700","5132020"," I see the VIX climbing."
"5132380","5133240"," I'm assuming too. "
"5133520","5134700"," Well, not assuming."
"5134940","5136260"," I already know why the VIX is climbing."
"5137380","5138260"," The VIX is not. "
"5138480","5142320"," So sometimes there are people saying the VIX is climbing because it's signaling a top."
"5144400","5145940"," There's some truth to that."
"5146120","5150180"," It also is because of where we are in the market. "
"5150460","5150880"," We're trading."
"5151700","5153240"," So what happens is this."
"5153680","5156300"," So when you guys, when we're training down. "
"5157000","5157520"," Okay."
"5157700","5158840"," Let me explain it better."
"5159020","5160620"," So if this was a year chart right here. "
"5161880","5163580"," And we were trading down."
"5165460","5166820"," This is 2022."
"5167940","5170140"," It's like training down like this, right?"
"5172860","5176200"," VIX goes off the scales and we trade out of that range. "
"5177280","5181520"," The same thing holds true when we trade above our range."
"5182220","5184260"," So if we're trading."
"5185540","5186540"," Pull in here. "
"5190820","5197760"," You figure up 2022 come down here and we're starting to come like right there."
"5198900","5201180"," This is out of our range, right?"
"5201180","5203860"," As we get closer, you're going to see the VIX."
"5204580","5208880"," You're going to see the VIX wanting to print higher as we break above, right?"
"5209940","5213120"," So because we know there's volatility here, right?"
"5213380","5214220"," We know there is. "
"5214480","5216260"," It would be a natural force to roll."
"5216500","5217380"," Actually, that's not true."
"5217940","5221300"," But that's actually not true. "
"5222720","5231700"," Someone was saying on Fintuit that there was an account on Fintuit that said this is the top."
"5234380","5240400"," And the one thing that he didn't want to say about the squeeze right now, look at this."
"5241700","5246420"," The one thing that he didn't bring up was time. "
"5246420","5253160"," And we talk about time in this show all the time."
"5253620","5260060"," He had brought up a, I believe, XLU divided by spy, not SPX."
"5261420","5265780"," And the one thing that he did not bring up was time. "
"5267960","5271900"," There's some other things that didn't bring up as well, but some other important things."
"5272320","5274620"," But one thing he didn't bring up was time."
"5276240","5282820"," And his statement also included risk off, which is not correction. "
"5283660","5285560"," The correction is not actually risk off."
"5285720","5287440"," I guess that could be an argument that it is."
"5288580","5290900"," But his point was this is the top. "
"5291180","5294600"," My point was a lot of time has passed."
"5296120","5302400"," As a matter of fact, what's fascinating about where we are in the market is you saw AT&T and"
"5302400","5302800"," Verizon."
"5303900","5309060"," There's a continuation of cutting the legs off the stool under the surface of the market. "
"5309720","5311940"," We're getting repricings all over the place, right?"
"5312240","5313000"," Still today."
"5314120","5322420"," But at the same time you've got this spy SP500 that is filled with tickers that have been repriced."
"5323600","5326840"," We have tickers that are about to be repriced. "
"5327920","5330660"," We were looking at was it Myrna the other day?"
"5332320","5334180"," I think I could be wrong in this."
"5334620","5337060"," It might have been Myrna had never been repriced."
"5340100","5341580"," And time has passed. "
"5342820","5344600"," So our market goes up."
"5344940","5346260"," I don't know if you know that."
"5346760","5347940"," But our market goes up. "
"5348440","5354280"," And if we spend enough time sideways and down, it's eventually not going to come back."
"5354480","5355240"," It's going to go up."
"5356420","5358980"," So when you say this is the top. "
"5359720","5364300"," So we've had some time where we've gone down in sideways."
"5365800","5373840"," I don't, this market doesn't like, I'm sorry our stock market doesn't go like up to 400."
"5375300","5380240"," And then trade down to zero and then trade back to 400. "
"5381220","5382820"," And then trade back to zero."
"5383960","5385300"," Contrary to your belief."
"5386840","5389480"," It grows every, every, every few years, right?"
"5389580","5390780"," Every 10 years, five years, 10 years. "
"5390880","5393140"," It goes up and up and up and up and up and up."
"5393680","5395580"," Now over time, that's what it does."
"5398600","5399740"," Especially the indexes. "
"5402400","5406680"," So they like the, like, that's the top for 60 done."
"5407440","5408960"," Roll back down to 100, I guess."
"5410660","5412120"," That's a pretty big implication. "
"5412120","5413820"," If that's the case, right?"
"5414360","5420880"," If that's the case, then I'm assuming that you're also making the statement."
"5422100","5425160"," Like when I heard, when I saw it, when I read that through the day, I was like, okay, so"
"5425160","5427360"," you're making some pretty big conjectures there."
"5427500","5430840"," You're saying that our stock market doesn't go up. "
"5432600","5438040"," You're also saying that if this is the top risk off top, right?"
"5438860","5441500"," You're implying that we're going to see a new low in the stock market."
"5443240","5446820"," So I want to know, is inflation done going down?"
"5450240","5451620"," Have rates been paused?"
"5454240","5456260"," Have we had a bunch of bad job reports?"
"5458560","5463000"," Is unemployment on the rise at the same time we're out of the Goldilocks zone?"
"5465160","5467620"," My last question here is a big one."
"5468880","5472400"," If we are risk off, ooh, that nice little drop down there. "
"5472400","5481220"," If we are risk off in the marketplace, if we're risk off in the marketplace, I also want to know,"
"5481700","5483760"," if I'm assuming that we're going to go to a new low."
"5484840","5486540"," So is that new low?"
"5488560","5495380"," Is that new low going to be 3500, 3450, 3200, something like that?"
"5497560","5504800"," If it is going to be that, if it is going to be that low, a new low, like 32"
"5504800","5508920"," or 28, is that the trough capitulation low?"
"5511100","5514140"," Is that the market is a fraud low?"
"5514820","5518380"," Like you're going to see a bank crash or something like that?"
"5518980","5520100"," You see that right there, does it help?"
"5520960","5524220"," It brings up a lot of questions."
"5525320","5534140"," So if this is the top with risk off at 3600, I want to know if that's your..."
"5534960","5537560"," I want to know the reasoning behind that. "
"5537780","5539020"," Is it the 10s and 2s?"
"5540040","5541360"," 2s and 10s?"
"5543760","5545600"," 10s and 30s?"
"5545600","5547440"," 3s and 30s?"
"5547520","5553760"," What is it that is saying that that is the top and that we're going to go down to see"
"5553760","5554100"," new lows?"
"5554320","5556320"," When you say risk off, it's a pretty big thing."
"5557620","5561360"," It's a big thing to be saying, like this is the risk off moment."
"5562680","5564320"," We're going to see a new low in the market. "
"5564600","5570540"," Normally when we see that, our actual new low, like normally if you have the trough, if any guys"
"5570540","5574780"," know anything about distribution and stuff, you'll train above the trough, come back down, retest,"
"5574960","5575680"," and then you're off and running."
"5576560","5582140"," Normally that's around like, so for where we were at 3450, which should be like 3500, 3600,"
"5582260","5582760"," something like that."
"5584040","5589820"," I do think we see that or something like that, maybe like March or something like that. "
"5590600","5598180"," Makes sense to me, but if you're thinking it's lower than that 3450, then you're talking about"
"5598180","5599360"," broad in the marketplace."
"5600900","5604020"," If you think there's fraud, I should have bought that fucking candle."
"5604600","5611020"," If you're thinking it's fraud in the marketplace, it's a pretty big statement. "
"5612540","5615280"," That's the 2008 scenario."
"5617360","5619480"," And that's the key point with Barry, right?"
"5619640","5623880"," Barry was like, you know, we got a normal like crash coming, but there's going to be another leg"
"5623880","5627180"," down because of fraud, right?"
"5629100","5630900"," Now, do I think the market's fraudulent?"
"5631180","5636020"," Fuck yeah, I do, but not in the way that that market was fraudulent."
"5637000","5642220"," That market fraud, that fraud in that market was completely different beast. "
"5648740","5650060"," So it's pretty big statement."
"5655410","5656990"," Is it risk off for a correction?"
"5658190","5659010"," I'll be down for that."
"5661430","5665730"," But I don't know if I'm down with the risk off. "
"5665990","5667830"," This is the top where we're going in the depths of hell."
"5670370","5676070"," Statement now, some of the white golf diagrams say that that can happen."
"5676070","5679650"," You have a failure below all time highs. "
"5681010","5682510"," And we can roll back down."
"5683130","5684410"," I've seen those diagrams."
"5686310","5691530"," So yeah, I mean, I can see the point, but that doesn't discount. "
"5692910","5694510"," Should you have bought 3450?"
"5694770","5695670"," Was it a tradable bottom?"
"5696850","5700250"," Is it something that I could buy and we risk off and I can see it happen?"
"5700890","5706690"," So even if it happens, you're going to know before it happens and you're going to have ample time"
"5706690","5707110"," to get out."
"5707830","5711090"," You're not going to wake up tomorrow and we're at 3,200, like tomorrow morning."
"5711810","5716390"," So there's no reason not to be long in the market and just look for the role is the point. "
"5718090","5719450"," Even if it does happen."
"5721770","5723350"," You guys aren't panicking here, are you?"
"5723430","5726490"," Are you guys want to be able to see?"
"5728470","5733710"," You know, when you get the roll over here, you still always come back up to check."
"5734110","5737030"," You want bears want to stifle this candle right here. "
"5739090","5741110"," So you'll be paying attention right there."
"5748230","5750550"," I guess this was my buy box down here, huh?"
"5751770","5752730"," We're down here."
"5753750","5756750"," I think I put two boxes down here earlier and then move them up. "
"5757670","5759690"," I wanted that so bad and I didn't take it."
"5760750","5761370"," That's okay."
"5767350","5768710"," I wanted to buy down here. "
"5769450","5771450"," Kevin James, Chief Calls down here."
"5772130","5772850"," I wish I had bought it."
"5778260","5779440"," You want to see it right there?"
"5782380","5783660"," Let's look at it closely. "
"5784060","5784620"," See this candle?"
"5785120","5786560"," This candle failed to get up."
"5787720","5788980"," You see that right there?"
"5791560","5793140"," Watch this failure right here."
"5793260","5794020"," See that one right there?"
"5794140","5794880"," No bueno. "
"5796480","5799020"," That's your chance on fuck yourself right there."
"5799540","5803000"," Even if it goes up, you have to reposition here."
"5804220","5806440"," You have no trade, believe it or not. "
"5807040","5808600"," That candle's bearish."
"5809180","5810020"," That green candle."
"5810440","5816240"," I don't know if you know that or not, but that green candle failure to get above. "
"5817140","5817800"," No bueno."
"5827340","5829500"," No, you can't take a trade here now."
"5829620","5834580"," If you get the roll here, let's say you bought this candle and it rolled down on you like this. "
"5835580","5840400"," It gives you the opportunity to get unfucked and then you don't get back in long unless it's above"
"5840400","5841780"," and confirms again."
"5842420","5844760"," You'd actually take this candle right here."
"5846460","5847440"," This is bearish. "
"5850480","5852220"," Even if it recovers, it's bearish."
"5853380","5856760"," This is your chance right here to..."
"5856760","5864880"," If you trade with rules, you get out right there and then you wait for a green candle."
"5865100","5867080"," Holds, do green instead so you guys can see it. "
"5868700","5870260"," There's a good example right here."
"5871120","5872820"," So let's say you bought..."
"5873480","5874140"," Let me see."
"5875980","5877700"," Let's say you bought this candle right here. "
"5878800","5885040"," If you go up, it comes down on you right and a lot of traders will panic sell."
"5886780","5888880"," This was red originally right."
"5889280","5890240"," They were panic sell this candle. "
"5891300","5892160"," You actually don't."
"5892940","5894220"," You hold long."
"5895080","5899080"," As soon as you get up here and you see the failure, it doesn't matter if you even squeeze higher. "
"5899080","5900600"," Right here, you get out of your trade."
"5902180","5908300"," Let's say you're in for 20 cents and it goes all the way down here."
"5908400","5909400"," It's worth like 8 cents. "
"5910160","5912980"," It was back up until 18 or 17 cents."
"5913580","5914980"," You had cut loose still."
"5915340","5916560"," Take the 3 cent loss. "
"5917740","5920620"," You managed your trade properly as a trader at that point."
"5922000","5923320"," 3 cents is no big deal."
"5923700","5925180"," 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents. "
"5925300","5927980"," It doesn't matter if it's a dollar or $3 or whatever on a higher time frame."
"5929420","5931080"," You take your L right here."
"5933020","5935820"," That's a nice stop where you put even if you hand did it. "
"5935880","5938260"," You have to have an actual stop loss so you can hand sell right here."
"5939000","5940880"," And then you would look for..."
"5941520","5943060"," This is a bear structure right here."
"5945280","5950420"," Now, even though you have a bear structure, if it recovers, you're still going to wait then. "
"5950720","5952900"," Let's say your thesis is we're still going up."
"5953400","5956180"," You're going to wait for a candle up here."
"5958420","5960460"," You're going to look for where these sellers are. "
"5960560","5961720"," It'd probably be right here."
"5962480","5964840"," You can see right here they'd step back in and sell you down."
"5967460","5968960"," So they'd sell you down right here. "
"5969920","5973120"," And if this then held..."
"5976680","5980020"," If this held, you would see another green candle."
"5982500","5986900"," This green candle would go up here and likely fail right here."
"5988240","5990060"," And then you get a red candle right here. "
"5994760","5994960"," Right?"
"5995200","5998160"," And that would try to sell but it couldn't because of that green candle right there."
"5999020","6001280"," You get a little green one right here probably something like this."
"6002500","6004640"," And then you get another red one right here. "
"6005280","6009180"," It'd be a red one right there."
"6009300","6011940"," They'd try to sell you one more time and they would be trapped."
"6013200","6016420"," And then you would then have calls set up. "
"6017160","6018520"," So you lost three cents here."
"6019680","6023300"," And you would see a break above this previous high."
"6023900","6027540"," And you would make that three cents back plus probably another seven or eight cents. "
"6028020","6031280"," Come back down here and you get one, two, and three."
"6031560","6034300"," And you'd be off and running to R2."
"6034640","6035940"," Now right here this is bearish. "
"6036900","6039540"," This one right here is bearish but it gives you a chance to get out."
"6040660","6043760"," The key point behind this is you never sell that right there."
"6044020","6045540"," You always wait for the pullback higher. "
"6046400","6049240"," You sell that in reposition for your thesis."
"6051380","6055720"," If you understand I'm talking about we go over it here quite frequently."
"6062440","6063460"," Now this is bearish. "
"6063580","6065340"," I assure you for the moment it is."
"6066160","6068740"," This is not a bearish set up right here."
"6070180","6075120"," Now if you are bearish today if you think expiration is going to matter this afternoon. "
"6077060","6078940"," I'll show you the structure before it plays out."
"6083240","6084220"," If it does play out."
"6084980","6088340"," I will actually take puts on this if this works itself out. "
"6090990","6092510"," I'm interested in puts here."
"6093590","6097710"," I'm bear curious but not going to buy puts yet."
"6101950","6104890"," So I would like to see a failure of the screen candle. "
"6106530","6107990"," We'll like to see this right here."
"6107990","6115380"," I would like to see a rip higher right there."
"6118220","6120300"," If I begin to see a failure right here. "
"6121520","6122320"," This start happening."
"6123860","6125060"," I would be in for this."
"6127760","6130860"," Maybe one more green candle up here somewhere in there. "
"6133040","6136360"," See that failure right there and then bam that's where you get your big move."
"6136620","6137780"," This is like a money move right here."
"6140680","6141980"," This prints big time. "
"6142600","6145820"," Now let's take a look at where the hourly trigger is."
"6146540","6147660"," Just look at some of the background."
"6149200","6150520"," Let's see what's going on this by. "
"6156650","6157890"," Apple's holding itself up."
"6158090","6159230"," Tesla's holding itself up."
"6159530","6160770"," NDX is holding itself up. "
"6161890","6162150"," Looking bullish."
"6164590","6168390"," Some of the greater markets not looking as bearish as this is showing."
"6169050","6170670"," Some nice green bar right here. "
"6170870","6172030"," They bought this one right here."
"6173090","6175050"," If this recovers I'll take calls too."
"6175190","6176050"," And this is the other thing too. "
"6176610","6178390"," So if you get a recovery here."
"6180890","6181890"," It's that same thing."
"6182030","6186450"," If you get the recovery comes back up, comes back down, starts to show itself to the upside. "
"6187230","6189450"," You set the call side up to take this trade right here."
"6198170","6199410"," New trade for me right now."
"6200350","6202330"," Nothing here so far. "
"6206880","6208380"," 458 or 4."
"6210980","6212120"," 453 in change."
"6214300","6219450"," It's moving up right now."
"6220670","6221950"," It's fucking close dude. "
"6235790","6237350"," No trade for me right now."
"6239850","6242490"," I do want to make another note programming note here."
"6243830","6246390"," Or not programming but a market note. "
"6246450","6247830"," I want you to notice something here okay."
"6249210","6255390"," Do you notice that it is 1030 in the morning right."
"6257430","6260970"," And you're not getting a trend day so far right. "
"6261930","6264890"," Push up here some failure going on here."
"6266370","6270630"," We didn't get like boom come up on R1 immediately going up to R2."
"6270630","6276250"," Like we're blasting off or we like lift our heads up in. "
"6276450","6279150"," It's 1.30 in the afternoon and we're up at R3 or R2."
"6279930","6282410"," So you're not noticing that right now in the market."
"6282970","6287970"," So not as bullish of a structure as a trend day right. "
"6288190","6290290"," This doesn't look like trend day right now does it."
"6291570","6297210"," It looks like an inside or no it's not an inside day but it's definitely a new high in the"
"6297210","6302910"," day but it definitely doesn't look like it definitely doesn't have the push that we normally have."
"6307460","6308540"," It looks like a sideways. "
"6316250","6317910"," Yeah the Dow is looking great man."
"6319650","6321890"," Some great fucking buys in the Dow right now."
"6325160","6326900"," Do a lingo climbing higher. "

"6343040","6343720"," It's testing. "
"6343900","6345620"," It's daily trigger right now."

"6363040","6365560"," Toast will enter that Oscar phase."

"6932440","6935180"," For the management and the administration and the moderation."
"6935960","6938080"," But right now a couple things out there."

"6941420","6942840"," We have dedicated."
"6944580","6945680"," Trainers in there."
"6945960","6947160"," We have education in there. "

"6949960","6951320"," We have mentorships in there."
"6952020","6955920"," We have some pick asked trainers in their trade and go back futures. "
"6957280","6962720"," And then we also have been working on making the discord very enjoyable."
"6963640","6967520"," Very useful and very easy to use."
"6968340","6972440"," I've been working on it diligently for two years and it's the discord is outstanding. "
"6973460","6976320"," So if you're tired of paying for a paid discord."
"6976960","6982100"," I used to pay for discord I'd pay 100 bucks 500 bucks 1000 bucks 600 bucks."
"6982120","6985760"," Matter of fact people in my discord know me from paid discord. "
"6987660","6992400"," So if you're looking for a place home or if you're losing trainer out there."
"6992780","6995300"," If your bank account is not green for the year."
"6996140","6997780"," It's a good place to be right now. "

"7004720","7007460"," On a handle called at captain's alpha."
"7010660","7013740"," So if you want to follow there on Twitter. "
"7016380","7022520"," If you want to follow that handle every morning I go in and allow all of you and I don't."
"7022520","7028280"," I'm reason I made a private was because of bots on Twitter."
"7033600","7038060"," I also make important posts there too. "
"7038800","7042340"," So in this ad captain's alpha handle I haven't had one to make for a while."
"7042920","7044320"," Because even in a bull market."
"7044800","7049060"," But if we are have any any market crash risk I'll make a post there. "
"7049420","7052540"," If the market crash risk goes away I'll make a post there."
"7053380","7057840"," If we're big market moves so if you want to know like hey we're going to crash."
"7058420","7059780"," That's where I post that stuff. "
"7060460","7063680"," If we have a risk of crash that's where I post that stuff."
"7064440","7066580"," If we're possibly bottoming."
"7067040","7068240"," That's where I post that stuff. "
"7068960","7071140"," I don't post that I'm been to it."
"7071440","7072420"," I like in my public handle."
"7073600","7077820"," And I lay it all up for you likes boom boom this this this and this. "

"7093760","7094480"," Appreciate the guidance."
"7094700","7095020"," You're welcome. "
"7105050","7106030"," Oh yeah I would."
"7106270","7106810"," I would on meta."
"7109620","7110640"," Maybe not the gap. "
"7110920","7112800"," Like it's it's not like you close me."
"7113060","7115760"," Like you've already been in meta you take the money and run."
"7116180","7120260"," If you want to leave runners on you could do that for a push higher for a new high. "
"7120260","7121860"," You want to pay attention."
"7122060","7123140"," You want to pay attention on meta."
"7123660","7125440"," Do they get the new high or not. "
"7126100","7127920"," The other thing that you're looking for here is."
"7128280","7130480"," I always like to renegotiate trades too."
"7130620","7133560"," So if you're already in meta and a long long trade on meta. "
"7133980","7136240"," For some time you take everything off the table."
"7136580","7138360"," And then you can renegotiate."
"7138440","7140720"," You can be like I bought some calls for a buck. "
"7140900","7141420"," They're now $10."
"7142020","7145580"," You take that money and then go back in and buy dollar calls right."
"7146160","7149920"," You're going to realize some of those gains and renegotiate the trade. "
"7149920","7151100"," For a squeeze above."
"7151920","7155880"," And then also know there's going to be some consolidation or firm rejection there."
"7158790","7161010"," Yeah you guys want me to look at a CVNA for you. "
"7161210","7161830"," Hold on a second here."
"7163030","7166810"," I should have done that one for you this morning because I know you guys are all amped up on"
"7166810","7166950"," it."
"7167110","7170850"," I know it's public Twitter is amped up on it right now. "
"7173090","7174690"," That's a little long in the tooth right here."
"7174790","7175330"," In my view."
"7176150","7176990"," It's very bullish. "
"7177490","7178690"," Let's let you want to look at CVNA."
"7179490","7180370"," We can look at it."
"7180370","7182170"," I got to pay attention to my trade here. "
"7182450","7184330"," I can see the rug pull right here."
"7184870","7186150"," There's a big rug pull right here."
"7188510","7189310"," Hold on a second. "
"7189410","7191410"," I'm going to put a stop on my calls."
"7191650","7192150"," Hang tight one second."
"7214870","7215350"," CVNA. "
"7220380","7225040"," So CVNA right had a nice cross back here in June."
"7226640","7228080"," On the 14th right."
"7229500","7231340"," Nice beautiful cross back here. "
"7231340","7240740"," Had confirmation trades here and here one to boom higher confirms and holds the hourly trigger."
"7240980","7245140"," You got your squeeze right outstanding job on CVNA."
"7245600","7247880"," There's a couple things to pay attention to here. "
"7248240","7250380"," It's a little long in the tooth on the daily."
"7251040","7252920"," I want you to pay attention to previous examples."
"7253920","7254440"," You can see. "
"7258760","7261260"," Yeah, Twilio T W L O."
"7261420","7262320"," I know it's cranking."
"7262880","7264840"," Wiki is on a Twilio trade this morning."
"7265020","7266020"," So I want you to see here. "
"7266700","7269420"," You got this nice lift up comes back down right."
"7269720","7273220"," Nice lift up comes back down right to reality right."
"7274060","7278640"," You can see right now we have the same situation playing out in Twilio. "
"7279040","7282340"," So can Twilio go higher?"
"7286920","7288000"," Yes, it can."
"7288500","7290460"," It has its monthly above here."
"7291060","7293660"," You are going to worry at the month 719. "
"7297120","7298240"," That's the third."
"7299040","7300960"," It's the 23rd somewhere."
"7302020","7303680"," Where we at 31st right there. "
"7305100","7316700"," I started"
"7316700","7319220"," out for you right now for CVNA."
"7323600","7325300"," Let me look at a couple things here."
"7330140","7332560"," Make sure I do this right for you so we don't screw this up. "
"7333460","7337100"," So big part about this is I want you to see where we are in CVNA."
"7337300","7337920"," See right here."
"7339300","7341660"," You need to break above this level right here, right?"
"7342460","7344660"," So we're going to draw this in right now. "
"7350790","7351390"," There."
"7352050","7364980"," I'm assuming"
"7364980","7366600"," your next volatility right here."
"7366680","7368200"," I'm going to bring this up a little bit right there. "
"7369700","7373600"," And then you're going to close which gaps right there."
"7374900","7380000"," Right there."
"7380860","7383640"," And another one right there. "
"7386900","7388100"," So Twilio."
"7389620","7391940"," 30 minute chart right here."
"7400320","7402120"," We'll tell you what I love you guys. "
"7402620","7402860"," Okay."
"7403260","7407320"," So we already know why the sellers are stepping in here, right?"
"7407500","7410080"," We already looked back as to why there are sellers right here."
"7410520","7413540"," So the first part of this trade, right?"
"7414720","7417760"," Is you going up into known sellers, right?"
"7419540","7422440"," This next leg that's happening right now. "
"7422600","7425180"," I don't like these legs even if we break above."
"7425180","7427700"," Normally it'll take you two or three attempts."
"7427860","7431040"," One attempt, two attempts, three attempts to break above. "
"7432000","7434340"," So the trade to me is dead right now."
"7434980","7438440"," Even if you break above the $64, $60 and change."
"7439180","7442920"," Now even though that trade is dead, there's a second leg to this trade. "
"7443860","7446740"," And that is if this comes up, right?"
"7447040","7448660"," So I'm going to show you this right now, okay?"
"7450020","7452620"," I'm going to chart this up for you and you can watch it."
"7455160","7455900"," Right here."
"7465740","7470520"," You break above one, two, three, right?"
"7472880","7474060"," Come back up here. "
"7474440","7475000"," Damn it."
"7482980","7484100"," You're going to get a failure."
"7484360","7485120"," No, no, no. "
"7487840","7489400"," You're going to get a failure in there."
"7490920","7495360"," The trade is still dead if you break."
"7495640","7498640"," The trade is still alive if you follow. "
"7499900","7503300"," Or as long as we stay on track here, okay?"
"7504000","7505780"," A stab on the hourly trigger."
"7506320","7506820"," Personally."
"7508400","7508980"," Personally. "
"7511280","7516060"," Even if you come up here, I always like to buy like a capitulation move down here."
"7516760","7518420"," Or the actual move higher."
"7518420","7528120"," So for me, if we're any point we're above, any point we're above $60, there's a trade to"
"7528120","7528600"," $76. "
"7529740","7529760"," Okay."
"7530500","7540480"," If not, where would I like to buy the next buy in for me is down here at $42.38."
"7541160","7545080"," So I'm a buyer at $42.38. Right?"
"7545200","7549140"," If you missed this trade or something, you're like, oh, everyone was talking about it."
"7550060","7552660"," Buy for me is that 40, 42, 83. "
"7553380","7560680"," Or the next buy would be a successful, a successful hold of $60."
"7563080","7570220"," So if we defend 60 bucks, if we break above here and able to hold this, I put some risk"
"7570220","7573760"," on to $75 with a stop below 60."
"7574440","7578920"," With that said, it's the same thing. "
"7578920","7580360"," It'll go again up here, right?"
"7580740","7583040"," So you go up here, you tag 76, you take the profit."
"7584280","7586080"," Fuck yeah, I'm making money right now."
"7586800","7593480"," So, you know, you're getting out as top buyers are getting in, right?"
"7593880","7596120"," You're hearing people scream about CVNA right now?"
"7596120","7597740"," You're actually selling into those people. "
"7598000","7603140"," So even if you get up here, this is your next buy on CVNA, right?"
"7604020","7605440"," So you re-enter here."
"7606020","7606720"," Everybody's scared."
"7607220","7608100"," You're putting the risk on. "
"7608220","7609120"," You're putting your stops below."
"7610200","7618880"," Your next target is 95.79. Saying all of that, the big squeezes come in"
"7618880","7620840"," above."
"7621380","7622280"," Actually, there's a big squeeze there. "
"7622440","7623180"," Sorry, I should say that."
"7623180","7629700"," The moment you get above this 79, you're going to get a big squeeze to 95, and then ultimately, a"
"7629700","7630860"," price target of 120."
"7632980","7634080"," Let me make sure I get that right. "
"7634280","7637500"," Yep, 120 is the target on CVNA."
"7638220","7640340"," So let me just put this out for you here."
"7641800","7642980"," That's level to level. "
"7644120","7649060"," If you want to snip that or whatever you want to do, it's a little long in the tooth here."
"7649500","7651200"," Personally, I'd like to buy it down here."
"7652720","7653640"," I love to buy. "
"7653740","7654700"," I always like cheapies."
"7655000","7655980"," So you get up there."
"7656180","7656920"," Everybody's woo-hoo-hoo. "
"7657000","7658640"," You're selling calls into these bulls."
"7659200","7661040"," It comes back down briefly for a moment."
"7661860","7664620"," And then you're making the next trip actually above. "
"7666460","7669880"," Yeah, that trip to 76, like 5.48 to 76."
"7670740","7673080"," That's my personal take on this."
"7673740","7676940"," But if we ever hold 60 bucks, you can take a trade to 76. "
"7676940","7679180"," You can add free option in the US."
"7679400","7679720"," Make sense?"
"7680100","7686020"," If you hold 60, you can take a trade to 76 with stops below a closing half an hour bar"
"7686020","7686740"," in 60 bucks."
"7688400","7688880"," CVNA. "
"7692440","7694120"," Would that help for you guys for Carvat?"
"7694240","7694720"," Carvana?"

"7715640","7716080"," I've been adding."
"7716260","7718240"," Matter of fact, I didn't add yet on. "
"7718480","7719360"," I want to add some."
"7719560","7720440"," What do you call it?"
"7720800","7721260"," TGT."

"7728680","7730680"," I'm adding some fucking AT&T. "
"7731660","7734580"," I meant to add yesterday and didn't get around to it."
"7735140","7738140"," I wanted to add a long PayPal right now."
"7738420","7739360"," I'm on all kinds of shit. "
"7741300","7744240"," Yeah, I'm long right now on 4.56 C's."
"7748640","7750360"," I'm long on 4.56 C."
"7750660","7759220"," As far as any like pullback on spy, like meaningful pullback on spy to add like 20, 30, $50,000"
"7759220","7760740"," on a call spread."
"7761300","7762640"," Haven't seen that pullback yet. "
"7763660","7764740"," If that's maybe what you're implying."
"7770340","7772360"," Yeah, T's been fucking awesome, right?"
"7772540","7773280"," We saw it yesterday."
"7773280","7775180"," It started yesterday morning. "
"7776080","7779040"," But then the confirmation was right on that fucking closing bell."
"7779180","7779760"," You can see it."
"7780540","7783220"," Like a half back trade, at least a half back trade. "
"7790400","7793280"," I'm trading 74 cents right now on 4.56 C."
"7802980","7804120"," Now these are for today."
"7805760","7806840"," These are zero dates."
"7807200","7809400"," If it's not a zero date, I'll tell you. "
"7809660","7809940"," I'll say."
"7810760","7814100"," So if I tell you, I just bought for 40s or for 10s."
"7814100","7817160"," It's for the nearest closest expiry. "
"7817780","7821700"," If I don't say anything to you, it's for today's or the nearest one."
"7823280","7828440"," If I take anything farther out, I always tell you it's a week from now or it's three days from"
"7828440","7829760"," now or it's one date from now."
"7830380","7834080"," But you just you just figure that's everything I'm doing is zero dates in stream. "
"7840540","7845100"," There has not been that like there was a pullback, but not good enough to put on."
"7845620","7850640"," I know what you're talking about like that big beautiful fucking three, four, five percent."
"7850860","7852040"," And then fucking wham. "
"7852460","7855960"," And it hasn't presented itself chasing the whole way right now."
"7858890","7861210"," They don't want to fucking pay this shit, man."
"7863190","7866530"," Oh, I fucking hate these 74 cents right now. "
"7869680","7871700"," 76 cents right now coming in the money."
"7873360","7875640"," These fucking dealers right now suck balls."
"7879760","7885120"," These fucking dealers are like like every day of this week, it's like you can buy for 30 cents. "
"7885340","7887480"," We have to hold it all day long for us to print you 90."
"7887860","7888740"," I'm like, God damn it."
"7890080","7891720"," I should have just taken the money there. "
"7898010","7901670"," I should have taken the money right there on that green bar."
"7903330","7903930"," It's all right."
"7904070","7904730"," Let's stay long here. "
"7906130","7906950"," It's pretty bullish."
"7907610","7908430"," Fucking bullish still."
"7910130","7911730"," I'm hand I got hand selling. "
"7912650","7914870"," I got hand stops right now too."
"7915030","7922390"," So what do I think of Ark as a synthetic?"
"7922470","7924750"," I like Ark as a synthetic trade too."
"7925030","7925510"," I like it. "
"7925770","7926250"," I like Ark."
"7926510","7931770"," I do like that trade, but personally for me, I love it's like what I like about."
"7932090","7933190"," I want to tell you something about this too. "
"7933190","7937490"," Like so sometimes people will ask about the trade and Ark for the synthetic trade."
"7938490","7946550"," My issue here is that let's say let's say let's say like Tesla red bars."
"7946650","7950830"," It does his test of the clothes and Tesla red bars it down right. "
"7951650","7953090"," We know it missed earnings."
"7954690","7961790"," Let's say it misses earnings since they miss the are right and Tesla red bars it down."
"7962250","7964570"," So then it green bars it back up briefly. "
"7965810","7966250"," Right?"
"7967850","7968790"," I can get out."
"7968990","7969430"," Can't I?"
"7970430","7974270"," Like four or five in the afternoon something like that."
"7974290","7975450"," I can get right out of that trade. "
"7975510","7975770"," Right?"
"7976770","7978730"," Could I get out of that trade if it was okay?"
"7981390","7983170"," Because it's going to go back red down."
"7983170","7983530"," Right?"
"7984710","7986270"," Can't get out of that trade in our cake."
"7986270","7986670"," Can I?"
"7988870","7993150"," So I get the idea that I get the idea. "
"7993150","7997550"," If you I understand that the emotions."
"7999790","8002850"," Like I'm a retailer and I have to support Tesla."
"8003290","8005150"," Maybe you say that publicly to people. "
"8006110","8009590"," I guess if you wanted to tell your arcade bull friends like."
"8010010","8013550"," Yeah, I traded Tesla on their earnings and made bank."
"8014370","8017490"," But privately synthetically traded on cues or something. "
"8018470","8019510"," You're gonna be a happier trader."
"8019750","8022730"," You can take all those winnings and buy Tesla or whatever you want."
"8022730","8024710"," To make you feel better about yourself. "
"8025050","8026710"," But having that option."
"8027270","8029790"," To get out it between four and four fifteen."
"8030690","8031750"," That's a big deal. "
"8033250","8034810"," Dude RX RX man."
"8035570","8036770"," Didn't we go over that one yesterday?"
"8039150","8040050"," Didn't we go over?"
"8040210","8040450"," Was it?"
"8040550","8041730"," Did we go over RX RX yesterday?"
"8041910","8042570"," Was it the other day?"
"8043210","8043830"," God damn."
"8043930","8044250"," Look at it. "
"8044930","8047210"," It's fucking booming right now."
"8048870","8050930"," Dude RX RX is fucking cranking."
"8052330","8055390"," We went over that one the other day because we are in biotech for July. "
"8059580","8062000"," Congratulations if you're trading that RX RX."
"8062780","8064240"," If you took that trade congratulations."
"8064900","8066460"," It is fucking ripping right now. "
"8068720","8070420"," Thoughts on Roblox?"
"8074900","8075940"," Keeps cranking higher."
"8076240","8077020"," Same setups right?"
"8078320","8080180"," Keeps climbing the wall of worry."
"8080440","8081640"," You looking for a price target on it?"
"8081940","8082760"," It's extremely bullish. "
"8083820","8086160"," It's coming into resistance right now."
"8086480","8087040"," Sellers."
"8087460","8089900"," This is the place to take profit. "
"8090940","8099520"," You're going to look to re-enter above 47.67. And then you're going to know maybe higher than that."
"8099680","8100600"," You get a lot of volatility."
"8101320","8103940"," Let me rephrase this with Roblox. "
"8104900","8109980"," So Roblox is setting up a stock into a, a stock into a chartis."
"8111760","8112980"," Last night of this morning."
"8119060","8120060"," Some of that I trust. "
"8122380","8125160"," And we were looking at tickers yesterday that."
"8127420","8131220"," We have tickers that we're looking at right now that are like they're going to just rip."
"8132720","8135060"," And then we're looking at tickers right now that are like. "
"8136400","8141160"," It's going to take a little while to grind through the ball and Roblox has some of that."
"8142300","8148240"," They have that ball until 53.05. They'll get through it."
"8148560","8150180"," They're just going to take some power moves. "
"8150780","8157340"," Once you're above there you'll see that giant fucking gap fill that big squeeze to $68."
"8158160","8160040"," Dude they're trying to sell this shit again."
"8161580","8162960"," Fucking come on. "
"8169020","8171220"," These fucking sellers are so stinky."
"8171820","8173180"," Look at that red ball right there."
"8174520","8176380"," I gotta watch this really quick. "
"8182010","8183470"," They're going to try to sell this again."
"8188680","8190300"," There's so much rage here."
"8204969","8210049"," It's kind of funny like I had a stop on this and then I took it off and I just"
"8210049","8210990"," put it back on again. "
"8211850","8213129"," I'm like fuck me man."
"8219209","8221809"," These sellers are pissed off here."
"8222930","8224870"," These sellers go way far back too. "

"8292360","8296959"," We have a price target of 153.76. Trade is still valid."
"8298940","8300400"," We are trading above."
"8301280","8302320"," Trade is still valid. "
"8303299","8310600"," Price as long as it stays above without a closing bar below 133.59. Still bullish to that target"
"8310600","8310920"," above."

"8364889","8365650"," I'll be right back."
"8365730","8366629"," I didn't go potty really bad. "
"8375549","8378690"," Hopefully if we roll I get stuck and stop down down here and get the fill."

"9394160","9395380"," You're about to already heard him."
"9397080","9401200"," ECB Spineris says inflation is falling and more tightening could hurt the economy."
"9401700","9404540"," And another 25 basis point rate height could be enough. "
"9406100","9407260"," Yeah I'm long here too."
"9407440","9408120"," It's just the exposure."
"9408460","9411380"," It's just like the 70 cents now trading 72 cents. "
"9411940","9414980"," And they put the 11 cents on the exposure is not so bad."
"9420710","9424310"," And the game potentials fucking up there right."
"9424630","9427290"," So put on like 300 contracts and 11 cents. "
"9427890","9431130"," Those fucking things will print two or three hundred percent if they go."

"9459190","9461850"," But it's kind of to be expected where we are."
"9461990","9464790"," And further tightening and monetary policy would be required. "
"9465450","9467330"," And inflation has begun to fall significantly."
"9468470","9473270"," Bank of England's Rams then says I see potential potential to increase slightly the pace of guilt"
"9473270","9473950"," stock reduction."

"10353460","10357620"," So whenever there's unknown news in the marketplace right."
"10358640","10362300"," They're going to like the banks are not going the banks aren't getting fucked. "
"10363800","10367220"," They're going to bring it back down and then they're going to get long."
"10368700","10370740"," And then you can follow them."
"10377710","10382170"," Not an indicator and it doesn't work by itself either. "
"10382730","10386270"," It's kind of odd like I've got people in discord that think that they."
"10386270","10389610"," There's a difference between an indicator and an edge."
"10390870","10394250"," And it doesn't mean the H.T. doesn't mean anything without the edge. "
"10405990","10408350"," Shouldn't Apple push by up captain."
"10408690","10409270"," No these are what."
"10409530","10412410"," So if you see an initial reaction in a stock. "
"10412670","10414830"," So if you see an initial reaction in a."
"10416190","10418950"," In like let's say right where we are right now right."
"10419230","10421970"," So you're seeing so they're going to roll NASDAQ right now."
"10421970","10425690"," They're going to roll Apple down and retrace the entire move. "
"10426330","10430290"," They will confirm the news they will get long and then you'll chase."
"10432430","10436890"," You're always the last one and they don't allow you to hopefully take the money to you by the way"
"10436890","10437510"," if you're in calls."
"10438450","10442670"," But they'll retrace this and not the entire but almost the entire at least a half back move. "
"10443090","10445670"," If not the entire move then they'll bring it back up again."
"10446710","10447890"," You're not going to beat a bank."
"10448350","10449210"," It's their playground. "
"10451610","10453230"," Well you'll beat a bank for a minute."
"10454610","10457630"," I was you see here's some crazy I got a cool story for you."
"10457970","10460950"," So I was sitting at home right. "
"10462090","10464670"," And I was looking at Microsoft."
"10465450","10466450"," I think it was Microsoft."
"10466650","10471210"," So I was looking at Microsoft had it open had the chain open. "
"10472330","10477050"," It was open on my desktop and I was I was like wanting to buy some Microsoft right."
"10478070","10482130"," I had this is the one time CNBC has ever paid me."
"10482930","10485050"," The one time so sitting at my desk. "
"10486390","10488270"," And a reporter."
"10490010","10493930"," Was talking to the the hosts of the show."
"10495070","10500790"," And he thought that he thought that the news had already broken. "
"10503510","10505990"," That tick tock might go to Microsoft."
"10508530","10511910"," And so he briefly mentions it while he's talking."
"10513450","10514530"," To the hosts. "
"10515570","10518650"," And the host says to the reporter because."
"10519430","10521090"," That hasn't broken yet."
"10522770","10525870"," Trying to tell him to stop talking to shut him up. "
"10526780","10527750"," So at that moment."
"10528610","10530670"," I slammed the buy button on like."
"10531910","10535490"," Five or 10 grand of zero dates. "
"10538390","10540990"," They were like pennies."
"10542090","10547290"," I just started like ramping like 300 packs of calls 300 packs of calls 300 packs of calls."
"10547810","10552610"," And within like 30 seconds maybe 15 seconds. "
"10553810","10555270"," Microsoft went straight up."
"10556190","10558450"," Just like this right now exactly like that."
"10560750","10564830"," And I think I made 120 K."
"10565950","10567230"," No, no, no, it was higher. "
"10567350","10568570"," It was like 160 K."
"10569970","10571570"," And I tried to close them."
"10572610","10575350"," And the dealers wouldn't take the closing price."
"10575850","10580070"," And I wasn't trying to sell at market because I was this order flow. "
"10580070","10581950"," It wasn't a prime bank that I bought them on."
"10583110","10585730"," So I was trying to close them and they wouldn't accept it."
"10585790","10588630"," And I didn't want to do market because I figured it would be really low. "
"10589310","10594590"," So I was hand dropping the price on the top just like Apple just now."
"10595150","10598550"," And it went from like 160 or 140 down to like 130 120."
"10599270","10600830"," I got some closes. "
"10601230","10603730"," It was really jagged to like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"10604270","10605470"," And then it would stop closing."
"10605470","10612670"," It sounded like drop it down to 120, then 110, then 90,000 to close the last of them out. "
"10614530","10618370"," And they didn't want to close them because I'm assuming there's a guy on the other end."
"10618570","10621090"," It's like we're bringing this ship back."
"10621110","10622310"," I don't want to close for this guy. "
"10622570","10629950"," And so you have to quickly give them some room to for them to make some money to sell to"
"10629950","10630650"," somebody else."
"10632010","10633670"," To make someone else the bag holder."
"10635110","10637870"," So it was really weird. "
"10638570","10643530"," That one trade was the only time ever been in that kind of money and that kind of."
"10644670","10648290"," Size and that kind of like an instantaneous win."
"10649350","10654070"," And that was on the news breaking on CNBC and I just happened to be in like right place, right"
"10654070","10654450"," time. "
"10655670","10657770"," Now all that shit came back to."
"10657770","10661070"," And I was panicking the entire time."
"10661150","10662030"," I was like freaking out. "
"10665470","10666990"," This fucking amazing."
"10668730","10670370"," Was fucking amazing."
"10671050","10672310"," I still have that paperwork. "
"10672590","10673150"," I printed that."
"10673350","10676690"," I posted that trade on Twitter at one time."
"10677710","10680250"," Trying to revenge trade this down right now. "
"10680850","10684830"," Now it counts apple going down right now all of a sudden the apple trade matters."
"10686670","10689990"," This shows you the amount of the wall that's here."
"10690130","10691750"," The sellers that are here right now. "
"10692550","10694810"," And how they want to sell this down on you."
"10694890","10695590"," This shows you."
"10696590","10698870"," You know that the scam market right. "
"10699070","10700650"," This is the scam market right here."
"10703630","10705290"," This is the dealers."
"10705590","10707210"," You're never going to fuck a dealer over dealers. "
"10707210","10708290"," Never going bankrupt."
"10711130","10712830"," So when I was closing these things."
"10713970","10718930"," In my mind I was like, I was like, they're going to sell these like they need room. "
"10720110","10722610"," Like I'm sure there's a there's probably a guy."
"10722870","10724730"," I'm assuming this wasn't an algorithm."
"10724730","10726510"," I'm assuming this was like a person. "
"10727650","10731370"," Like it flagged somebody that was like, we ain't fucking taking that shit."
"10733470","10735090"," That was my assumption."
"10736010","10738990"," And I finally closed them. "
"10739070","10740350"," I closed and made a lot of money."
"10740770","10743750"," I think when I was done, I think total was a hundred and twenty K."
"10745430","10746990"," It was a great fucking trade."
"10747950","10749150"," Great fucking trade. "
"10750530","10751310"," To know."
"10752070","10753410"," It wasn't anything I did."
"10753850","10758330"," Like it wasn't like I planned it or was smart enough to know to do it. "
"10759190","10760550"," What an only time ever."
"10771490","10776770"," Yeah, I kind of know Tesla is old news, but you know, it's like."
"10779230","10781250"," He didn't have the chips. "
"10781850","10783270"," He does right now."
"10783350","10784490"," He's buying them."
"10784910","10787930"," There's a couple like small stories done. "
"10791150","10796630"," Six to nine months ago, a year ago, and then the story started great gaining traction."
"10796630","10801490"," I think at one point, he was on back order for hundreds of millions of dollars in chips."
"10802430","10806790"," So I'm going to assume that part of that is for company X."
"10809270","10810350"," For Twitter. "
"10811970","10813810"," It would never shock me to see."
"10816630","10819970"," You know, like that's that whole conversation about rolling."
"10820030","10823390"," Do you guys remember when like company X was the word was the name. "
"10823970","10828290"," That everyone was agreeing upon for like an umbrella company for all of this."
"10828770","10831350"," Like now they're talking about it being Twitter."
"10832550","10836270"," Like some kind of master or or umbrella. "
"10837250","10839250"," For like space X and."
"10840670","10842710"," That's how they weren't talking about Twitter, but."
"10844410","10846070"," That's how I think they were talking about. "
"10846250","10850090"," All of his companies and one under one roof."
"10857880","10858800"," No, no, no, no."
"10858900","10860100"," This was years ago. "
"10860580","10861420"," So company X."
"10862120","10864160"," I don't know if you guys know this."
"10864460","10866380"," Some of you probably know, some of you maybe don't."
"10866460","10869080"," Like this whole conversation started on Twitter, right?"
"10869560","10870760"," Am I wrong or right on this?"
"10872380","10874060"," I'm not talking about an investor today. "
"10874120","10875200"," I'm talking about prior to that."
"10876720","10880880"," There was like there was a few Twitter handles that were like you should put everything under one"
"10880880","10881240"," umbrella."
"10881720","10882300"," Take it all private. "
"10883100","10884440"," Call the entire thing company X."
"10885520","10886580"," Am I wrong on this?"
"10887720","10889020"," Does anybody remember that conversation?"
"10897800","10898900"," You guys remember that?"
"10898900","10899960"," You guys remember that conversation?"
"10901020","10903040"," And then, yeah, somebody does here."
"10904320","10905920"," Fermi's paradox remembers it."
"10912360","10914620"," You got, yeah, Jeremy, remember that shit, don't you?"
"10916880","10923460"," Yeah, there was this whole like X dot com for PayPal, but then there was a."
"10923460","10928080"," Yeah, it was a bunch of like a bunch of bulls wanted. "
"10928300","10928840"," Yeah, exactly."
"10928940","10930920"," They want to get a piece of space X before IPO."
"10931940","10935060"," They wanted the what's the what's the brain company called?"
"10935380","10937140"," I'm having a mind block on it right now. "
"10939060","10940840"," And they wanted everything to fall on it."
"10940920","10942740"," There was like talk of taking Tesla private."
"10943320","10945140"," There was talk of now. "
"10945220","10948660"," This is before the conversation with Twitter him buying Twitter, but."
"10949420","10952380"," On this whole basket or this whole group of companies."
"10952620","10953660"," Yeah, no link. "
"10955320","10957200"," Was it David Lee that suggested it?"
"10957340","10959120"," I don't remember, but I don't remember."
"10959280","10961820"," It's I vaguely remember that conversation."
"10966870","10971690"," So I mean, I guess it does pose the question of I get my point here is that. "
"10972590","10974990"," If he's accumulating all of these chips."
"10976690","10979630"," You know, he could you know, words are right."
"10979830","10981910"," You can be like, oh, yeah, by the way. "
"10983310","10985310"," And you just saw this with Apple, right?"
"10985770","10988170"," All you need is Elon to say something like."
"10988990","10992290"," I've I ordered $500 million in ships."
"10993550","10995150"," I built a data center. "
"10996770","10998610"," We're going to run Tesla through it."
"10999050","11001230"," You know, something like that."
"11001230","11004970"," And it'll be a big suck off. "
"11008970","11011690"," You'll see all the Tesla Tesla gang like."
"11012750","11016070"," Self elationating themselves in the stock ago moon."
"11017010","11018990"," I'm a Tesla bull, by the way, if you don't know. "
"11019890","11022810"," But you know, I still make fun of Tesla bulls."
"11036590","11038410"," Yeah, you know, I'm actually for it."
"11038490","11041430"," So my initial, the reason I'm a Tesla bull. "
"11043230","11046090"," I want you to know the reason that it's really fascinating."
"11046090","11049510"," Like it's a little bit more accepted today, but there was a time when it wasn't."
"11050690","11052190"," Accepted why I was a Tesla bull. "
"11053810","11059290"," I was a Tesla bull back in the day because I was in the military."
"11062230","11067110"," And so my history in the military is like my father served, my grandfather served."
"11067950","11068790"," It wasn't anything political. "
"11069450","11070790"," No, it's very apolitical."
"11072670","11076890"," I'm like an idealist when it comes to what I hope our country could be."
"11077690","11082490"," I know that we're not that country, but I hope that we will become that country at some day or"
"11082490","11085830"," live up to those those values, right?"
"11087150","11090670"," It's very similar to what's written at the bottom of the feet of the Statue of Liberty kind of"
"11090670","11091150"," stuff, right?"
"11091730","11098090"," So anyways, I always compare Elon to Howard Hughes. "
"11099970","11106790"," And I know from my middle military experience that you never want to have the lowest possible"
"11106790","11113730"," bidder and and the thinkers for your future be only."
"11114750","11117270"," Squares, you want like that X factor."
"11118470","11128210"," Every generation should have one in the conversation with the normal normal companies that are"
"11128210","11129050"," leading the future. "
"11129470","11132290"," Even if you don't agree with them, even if you think they're fraudulent or whatever, it doesn't"
"11132290","11132570"," matter."
"11133030","11141870"," You have to have a visionary that thinks outside of the box so that you're not left behind,"
"11141870","11144410"," especially as foreign hegemony is a country."
"11146050","11149250"," So at least that's my thesis, right?"
"11149710","11159130"," So when I see like boring tunnels under the under under Nevada and stuff, I'm thinking more of two"
"11159130","11159410"," things. "
"11159650","11161430"," I'm like fearful of artificial intelligence."
"11161710","11164190"," I do have an existential threat artificial intelligence."
"11164930","11166990"," I also am fearful of nuclear war. "
"11168050","11175210"," So to have be able to build tunnels on another planet or moon to bore that stuff, I think about"
"11175210","11175470"," that."
"11176010","11181450"," I think about knurling and that might be the only way for us to beat AI is to become a"
"11181450","11184930"," part of AI, believe it or not."
"11185250","11194410"," So if you're if you're critical to AI or become symbiotic to some extent, with AI, you might have a"
"11194410","11196490"," fighting chance against it. "
"11197630","11199770"," I'm very fearful of AI from other countries."
"11201330","11205030"," Not so much like the science fiction part of it."
"11205270","11210590"," I'm more afraid of nation states competing with each other against it. "
"11212330","11213330"," That's my big fear."
"11213690","11216050"," And then same thing with automobiles, right?"
"11216290","11218190"," I want to see autos progress."
"11218190","11221150"," I want to see internet progress. "
"11221630","11226750"," I want to see I don't want to see us lose against the future."
"11227110","11233010"," So whether I like them or not as a person is a different topic."
"11233870","11240570"," It's more of does he is he keeping the other people out there on us and trying to progress. "
"11240950","11245970"," Now whether that's Tesla that becomes this big auto company or not, I don't really care."
"11246590","11248110"," I just care that he's there."
"11248930","11253970"," Revenge selling right now in spoos 1231 in the afternoon. "
"11255450","11259270"," Trying it again right now trying to sell this market down up here."
"11260290","11262190"," Probably some pretty pissed off."
"11262510","11268110"," I'm going to assume these are banks up here with Apple and banks do not like hearing this right"
"11268110","11268350"," now. "
"11268510","11273010"," So you're probably watching selling coming in over that news right now."
"11278780","11281940"," But for me anyways, if it's not Elon, who would it be?"
"11282480","11288260"," You have to have that you have to have that outside player always."
"11288280","11294160"," And if you if you missed that in your generation, it's pretty bad for you, right?"
"11294640","11295960"," We had it during World War II. "
"11296720","11300380"," We had it then in the 1960s into the 1970s."
"11301360","11305300"," We had Wozniak and some other people in the in the 90s, 80s and 90s."
"11305940","11307040"," You had Bill Gates. "
"11307880","11316020"," And so whether you like these people or not, each generation, you should have these outside the box"
"11316020","11321420"," thinkers in my view at least for the continuation of of humanity."
"11324400","11326400"," I'm not in Tesla calls right now."
"11329570","11331010"," No bear plane just yet. "
"11332250","11334610"," You got a little bear plane right here, but you're big."
"11334830","11336150"," Yeah, you got a little bit of a bear plane here."
"11336690","11338630"," But the larger bear plane is higher. "
"11341550","11342650"," Oh, you'd need to see."
"11347690","11349790"," You would need to see this right here."
"11354760","11357880"," You need to see a price come back up. "
"11358460","11359320"," Fail right here."
"11360760","11361820"," And then fail right here."
"11364040","11366480"," We're going to find out where the early trigger is right now too. "
"11388750","11391090"," Yeah, no, I'm not in any Tesla calls."
"11391090","11392830"," I got stopped out of spy calls."
"11392870","11394310"," I had a stop on my calls. "
"11403590","11428700"," 53.45. I'm"
"11428700","11433080"," long again right now and 4.56 is for 41 cents."
"11445290","11450130"," Apple just retested its 27 EMA and a five minute chart."
"11473720","11475560"," Doesn't look like excellent liquidity to me. "
"11477880","11479880"," I've traded these announcements before."
"11480220","11482340"," They pull it back all the way and then they go long again."
"11484900","11489320"," Well, I guess if we start to roll here at some point, we'll find out real quick. "
"11489500","11490520"," We'll see the role here."
"11493340","11496080"," If this begins to roll, we're going to know it really fast."
"11498040","11507990"," Put some price targets to the downside of it does begin to"
"11507990","11508230"," roll. "
"11513060","11513860"," Let's see here."
"11515000","11515700"," It's break."
"11516040","11516860"," Got your failure up here. "
"11522040","11523180"," They have long calls again."
"11529520","11536730"," If you think we're getting the role here, some of the fat looks like they think we're going."
"11537690","11538730"," One right there. "
"11539590","11541790"," I'm not on this trade right now to the downside."
"11544230","11548430"," I said it earlier in stream that you get the initial push higher."
"11549230","11556150"," When you have unknown news in the market, they'll pull it back and then they'll get long"
"11556150","11556830"," themselves. "
"11559430","11561150"," And then they'll be another move higher."
"11562370","11571950"," If you think this is what's called exit liquidity for the well "
"11571950","11572670","-timed news."
"11576010","11578130"," There'd be your PT3 right there. "
"11580930","11583050"," There's your PT2 right here."
"11585990","11588050"," I'm looking to see if there's a failure here."
"11592250","11602020"," Get your changes to a red limit somewhere"
"11605060","11605540"," in there. "
"11606300","11610240"," I guess here's your middle of the afternoon of expiration."
"11614120","11614780"," Right there."
"11614880","11616780"," You need to see the failure. "
"11616980","11617280"," It's happening."
"11617480","11618820"," There's failure right here off the sixth."
"11619660","11620420"," I do see that. "
"11620740","11622520"," They're going to want to break down here and get underneath."
"11624960","11626420"," Then start setting this down."
"11626800","11627660"," One right there. "
"11628060","11630180"," And then one right down to the H to the hourly trigger."
"11638190","11639590"," It's the most bearish we've had though."
"11639830","11640350"," It's pretty good. "
"11641250","11642130"," It's good for the bears."
"11642130","11644210"," This is better than we've seen in many days."
"11648320","11652160"," You can see the strength of sellers up here. "
"11652560","11653180"," I'm not going to lie."
"11653360","11654680"," They got some strength up here today."
"11656480","11659780"," They definitely didn't want to see that Apple news. "
"11660840","11667900"," You can see that they tried to pin Apple above here or spy above as Apple ripped new faces off."
"11668520","11673700"," Now Apple has quite closed the entire thing, but it did bounce off."
"11673820","11674860"," It's 27 EMA. "
"11675220","11680380"," Tesla is selling off right now trading 293.60. Now Tesla looks bearish."

"11692180","11692800"," Give me a second here."
"11698730","11700490"," I'm not going to adjust it."
"11700490","11702870"," I'm just patiently waiting down here seeing what happens. "
"11720560","11730380"," You caught them at $0.39. Yeah, I see the cross right"

"11832850","11834050"," Should I play some bear music for this?"
"11834230","11835390"," This should go down here."
"11837190","11838470"," There's PT-1. "
"11838750","11839610"," Where's PT-2?"
"11841010","11841950"," Right there."
"11842890","11844370"," Put that one right there."
"11845770","11846830"," Can I see it now?"
"11846910","11847830"," It's right there. "
"11851580","11852620"," There it is."
"11858400","11860020"," Have some stops, baby."
"11868540","11870240"," PT-3 right there. "
"11874130","11876370"," Have it on the one minute chart right now."
"11876550","11877530"," You can see it right here."
"11878930","11879630"," Confirmed cross. "
"11880410","11883370"," You're going to see bulls get choked out here."
"11884770","11886450"," Maybe a squeeze right there."
"11886570","11887670"," Tag right there. "
"11887850","11888170"," Boom."
"11889010","11889890"," Down there."
"11892780","11893840"," Come on bears. "
"11896320","11897260"," Come on bears."
"11897260","11898200"," You can do it."
"11903300","11910280"," There's just a bunch of uber bulls on Tesla. "
"11910400","11912600"," Oh, I'm way back in the chart here."
"11912600","11916260"," U.S. 20 year bond extends out performance on day."
"11916420","11917220"," You guys want the bear music?"
"11917360","11917840"," I got it for you. "
"11917940","11918120"," Hold on."
"11918460","11920680"," We haven't played the bear music in a long time, have we?"
"11922280","11924660"," You're probably going to get a nice down move right here."
"11925840","11927620"," So I'll play some bear music for you. "
"11927660","11927860"," Hold on."
"11929540","11930760"," You guys want me to start it up?"
"11932200","11933920"," How about I'll start it right now."
"11935040","11936000"," Hold on a second here. "
"11943770","11944670"," Oh, yeah."
"11944670","11948850"," We've played this song in a long time."
"11950750","11953910"," If you are in calls right now. "
"11955650","11966470"," Do you"
"11966470","11970250"," want something like that?"
"11980000","11980860"," Oh, come on."
"11996610","11998830"," I'll move this to the side so you can see it."
"12012770","12013290"," Fail. "
"12018750","12019630"," Right now I'm in calls."
"12020130","12029040"," So we didn't play this song for bears in a while."
"12029040","12038730"," So I can't turn it up until they get the rejection right here. "
"12045440","12048540"," 39 cents right now on 4.56 C's."
"12051920","12053940"," Yeah, I know it shouldn't be on yet to it."
"12054880","12055620"," I agree. "
"12055860","12056800"," We always fight about it."
"12056800","12057700"," We've played it for them."
"12057920","12061440"," Every time I try to turn it on for people like turn it off until it's red. "
"12062600","12064500"," There's like a big fight about it."
"12069900","12071280"," It's a pretty decent."
"12071720","12072980"," Turn this off real quick. "
"12074380","12075520"," It's kind of weird."
"12075860","12080260"," Like there's 417,000 calls."
"12081140","12085540"," They're at 39, 34, 38, 40, 39, 41 cents. "
"12088720","12091220"," It's like the old bucket conversation, right?"
"12093480","12095220"," There's some money here to the downside."
"12095400","12098740"," I don't think you're going to get that low."
"12099300","12099760"," Maybe. "
"12100020","12101740"," Maybe there's enough juice to get down there."
"12104060","12105020"," Damn it."
"12107980","12109760"," There's not a ton of juice here. "
"12110220","12112300"," It's not a lot of fucking juice right now."
"12113160","12117340"," There's like 418,000 calls for 41 cents."
"12117780","12120120"," I mean, they can slam it down to like 10 cents. "
"12120720","12126720"," And take that 30 cents out of there or something to pay the put side."
"12128340","12130380"," It's not a ton of fucking juice here."
"12132320","12133840"," Not a fucking ton of juice. "
"12135480","12138280"," There goes Apple regaining itself now."
"12138920","12141380"," Apple now trading 195 again."
"12142800","12144660"," So all the dealers are happy. "
"12144800","12146160"," All the banks are happy again."
"12152530","12154830"," Yeah, I kind of feel bad for bears, man."
"12155170","12158350"," It's been like, it's been kind of shitty for bears. "
"12158770","12160290"," You know, like bring back the old days."
"12161610","12164490"," You know, good old fashioned like, good old fashioned."
"12164630","12165130"," I'm not going to lie. "
"12165370","12167250"," Like good old fashioned fucking bloodbath."
"12167970","12171850"," Close under here and then close the day out nice and red."
"12172930","12174110"," I'm not going to lie. "
"12184510","12187030"," I got some stops here in my calls again."
"12188850","12192050"," If it starts to rain, hell down here, I'll get out."
"12193390","12194850"," It's set up to do that. "
"12195750","12198150"," It's set up for a big downside move here."
"12200390","12201010"," It's dude."
"12201270","12203670"," I'm going to show you guys. "
"12203790","12204770"," I want to show you guys something here."
"12205470","12206690"," I'm going to show you what sucks here."
"12208530","12211530"," It's like any of these downside moves have been short lived. "
"12212790","12214910"," I want to show you guys something briefly here."
"12226160","12233780"," Even when we break under, I mean, like dudes, I bought puts over here and I never cashed them out."
"12235980","12238960"," And I bought correction puts for down here. "
"12239480","12240140"," So these are torch."
"12240440","12241220"," These are for August 10th."
"12242840","12244900"," I bought puts though that were a four twenties. "
"12247000","12249260"," I mean, four thirty two, sorry, four thirty two and four twenty."
"12249260","12252460"," The four thirty two's never came in the money."
"12254440","12255080"," Right?"
"12255520","12256220"," The four twenties. "
"12256640","12257840"," I'm going to be fucked on those."
"12259560","12264360"," So even the rollovers are not like big."
"12264660","12274380"," Now saying that even right now today, even right now today, the real move is below"
"12274380","12276580"," four fifty three fifty three. "
"12276580","12284900"," So like you want the, it's not like you want the confirmation down here for the bigger move."
"12285720","12288460"," Like the juicy part of this trade is right here."
"12289100","12292920"," It's like four fifty three to call it four forty five. "
"12294940","12296120"," Maybe four forty."
"12299420","12301740"," Now pay attention to that right there."
"12302420","12308060"," Um, you know, so as of right now, it's been a, it's been a dip by, right?"
"12308360","12312320"," You trade down to the hourly trigger and you take it higher again. "
"12312700","12318660"," You can see it here, right here, here, here, here, here, here."
"12319120","12322520"," You know, is this just another fucking chance to buy a fucking dip?"
"12323240","12326780"," So pay attention to what I'm saying right now because I'm going to show you where that green, where"
"12326780","12328200"," that green line is right now."
"12328200","12334400"," So, uh, my point here is this is the green line right here. "
"12334600","12342880"," My, my point, my point here is that, um, you know, this isn't even the money trade for fucking"
"12342880","12343120"," bears."
"12343640","12346700"," Like bears want to like get under here."
"12348380","12351160"," You know, that's, that's a couple more than we do. "
"12351320","12356420"," Oftentimes what we're seeing is like the move down and then boom correction over."
"12356420","12358760"," We're fucking off and running again."
"12359380","12365020"," We're seeing that a lot, but seeing this, uh, consistently, this is where the pain trade has been"
"12365020","12368260"," for, for sellers is no follow through to the downside. "
"12368940","12373200"," Even when you're getting the follow through, you know, we're not getting the, we're not getting"
"12373200","12375600"," like the big move down even to the daily trigger."
"12375840","12379660"," It's like, oh yeah, it stopped fucking 20 points from the daily trigger and bounced."
"12381120","12384140"," Um, so there is a good trade right here. "
"12384140","12393060"," But even so, like this is the money trade of this whole trade, but you know, you want like fucking"
"12393060","12400880"," sellers want to like get this trade, you know, blast this shit down, hold down here, bloodbath into"
"12400880","12402200"," a close coverage here."
"12402200","12406420"," We're seeing that two to 87 and prior high yield is at four spot, zero at one."
"12406660","12408880"," You know, bulls want it too. "
"12410620","12412180"," I'm not going to lie here."
"12412180","12416640"," So to see a comment from Bank of England, Ramsden, who says the latest UK inflation data shows"
"12416640","12421540"," indication indicators of inflation persistence still a bit higher than the Bank of England expected"
"12421540","12422120"," in May."
"12422620","12425680"," And then you've got dealers that don't want to pay the puts from yesterday. "
"12425960","12432860"," So analysts note that the curve steepening trend from early July lows has cheapened the auction"
"12432860","12438820"," sector on the curve, but it remains inverted versus the short end, the 10s, 20s, 30s fly at around"
"12438820","12441300"," 46 basis points is near the middle of it."
"12441460","12445300"," So 12 to 82 basis point range over the past three years."
"12445800","12451620"," So also taking a note of the latest CFTC positioning data ahead of this 20 year bond sale, which"
"12451620","12458760"," did show that speculators were net shorts around 131,000 bond futures contracts, which could be"
"12458760","12459380"," seen as a possible. "
"12460000","12461460"," I'm going to mute that real quick."
"12461460","12465560"," And when we started the show this morning, I was like, that looks like an inside day."
"12465560","12468440"," Of course, it isn't because we got the new high over here, right?"
"12468580","12470620"," But it does look like a fucking day. "
"12471040","12474940"," Trap and bulls make you place your bets for this ER report."
"12475620","12478840"," I think it was even talking about Joe about this on the phone this morning."
"12479040","12484580"," I was like, man, it's so setting up to make you bullish grinds you right into the close and you're"
"12484580","12489640"," trapped in if you're trading Tesla, Netflix, any kind of ER trades. "
"12489860","12492220"," I'm sure as shit is looking like it right now, right?"
"12492220","12497280"," Like they're not going to pay your puts for Vixpiration."
"12498680","12501680"," They're not going to fucking they're not going to pay the upside."
"12502660","12504080"," Even with the Apple rip. "
"12505820","12507600"," Apple's going up again right now."
"12509000","12512340"," Now you probably have banks long on this Apple news."
"12513840","12520340"," They're not going to want to get fucked up like they did on on Nvidia, right?"
"12520340","12524940"," So kind of looks like that trade, doesn't it, Joe?"
"12526180","12527720"," You can see how it's setting up, right?"
"12527940","12530440"," Like boom, going up close in this day. "
"12531940","12533700"," You know, doing this bullshit here."
"12534160","12537200"," Down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up."
"12537700","12539080"," Thank you very much for playing. "
"12539880","12542720"," And then here comes your real move in the after hours for earnings."
"12548520","12549540"," Squeezing right now."
"12550440","12552700"," I'm actually up a couple pennies right now, I think. "
"12569940","12571080"," Yeah, you remember that Brad?"
"12574680","12577220"," We're due for a random day where everything crashes right."
"12577660","12578600"," Yes and no."
"12579620","12584880"," Someone made a post and then Scott had reposted it with some data on. "
"12585680","12589840"," If we get a 1% move in a day, more than greater than a 1% move in a"
"12589840","12590060"," day."
"12590980","12593800"," That we have real risk of selling hard and heavy."
"12595800","12597880"," Yeah, if we trade above here. "
"12598800","12600700"," You know, we hit this target up here."
"12600800","12602280"," Sure, we'll start selling."
"12604660","12609640"," 1% at 4.55 though is not the same 1% at 3.50 is it?"
"12610420","12612680"," We do have some range expansion right now. "
"12612840","12618040"," I am anticipating a roll or a top at some point."
"12619460","12621740"," For July between now and Friday."
"12622780","12624720"," Thursday, Friday, something like that. "
"12625880","12628660"," And then a potential roll into next week."
"12629320","12631780"," But even then, I don't expect it to be that big."
"12632560","12635640"," Like my downside, I would love it. "
"12635920","12642560"," Like dude, if we could get down to like 4.20. I'll take 4.20. If we can get 4 "
"12642560","12643700",".20, it'd be fucking stoked."
"12645100","12649940"," It's hard though in a bull run bull market to get that to happen."
"12652080","12655080"," We need Jenny Marcus prep, another good point. "
"12656000","12657380"," The NASDAQ rebalancing."
"12658320","12659460"," So they call them the."
"12660180","12663320"," They're called the bond vigilantes sometimes. "
"12664700","12667200"," They're liquidity providers to the market."
"12667520","12667800"," And."
"12668500","12672560"," If they rebalance and just make this market go down and just cool off. "
"12674260","12675880"," They are known to do that sometimes."
"12677460","12679920"," These are like actual people that make this decision."
"12681460","12683520"," If that were to happen, that would be great. "
"12684960","12689360"," The only way that I can trade it is I'll buy like really cheap puts."
"12690460","12691640"," I'll buy zero dates."
"12691900","12692160"," Not zero. "
"12692360","12693800"," It's like one dates or two dates."
"12694060","12694980"," I've got puts for today."
"12696340","12697480"," But they're never going to print. "
"12697700","12698840"," They got four forties for today."
"12699100","12701160"," They're never going to fucking print me that shit today."
"12702160","12704700"," So I don't know if we had a market crash today and make bank. "
"12705760","12706200"," But."
"12707720","12709560"," I don't know how to hedge that event."
"12710020","12714720"," I think the only way to hedge that event is if you're going along the market to buy like some"
"12714720","12717180"," five cent puts or something like that. "
"12721060","12726120"," It's the only way that I can think of put on a ratio spread with some time on it."
"12727060","12731540"," The reason I say ratio is because you know the fascinating part with the ratio spread is."
"12732080","12734780"," We didn't get the down move to four thirty two right. "
"12735100","12736080"," They bought it all up."
"12736620","12737700"," We ended up going up."
"12738060","12742680"," So your ratio spread was even or making five percent or so. "
"12744820","12745760"," Come on bears."
"12747860","12756320"," I can't fucking do puts in this market right now."
"12757260","12758060"," Last year. "
"12758560","12758980"," No problem."
"12759300","12760320"," You could buy me be fine."
"12760540","12761800"," But right now it's hard as fuck. "
"12763020","12766440"," You're going to be as tactful as buying calls last year."
"12767200","12768320"," Like just as tactful."
"12768460","12769500"," Like you're in your out. "
"12770640","12773820"," You know what your targets are and you wrap it up and go home."
"12774800","12776300"," Like you make your trade for the day."
"12776480","12777380"," You made some money and you leave. "
"12786410","12786850"," Yeah."
"12787110","12788170"," Well we saw it."
"12788850","12791530"," So there was two or three closes last week. "
"12792530","12797690"," The week before there were three closes where we saw the all go step in right."
"12798410","12799270"," Fucking Jedi saw."
"12799490","12800270"," We all saw it. "
"12802330","12803910"," We're like oh it's going to roll over."
"12804130","12806870"," And then we're waiting in stream until four o'clock."
"12807410","12809110"," And it's like four oh one in the afternoon. "
"12809130","12812290"," You just watch them come in and it's like the silent hand just bought it."
"12813230","12815130"," You're like fuck they roll and nothing over."
"12815490","12818170"," They're going to come back tomorrow and rip this thing higher again. "
"12819730","12824030"," You're watching like we were watching like it's very rare to see like."
"12825190","12827950"," Five hundred thousand calls closing the money."

"14059820","14060840"," But never did."
"14061660","14063320"," So then I traded indexes eventually."

"14092880","14098160"," So I used to pay alphas that would trade live private streams. "
"14100680","14102060"," And they were never there."
"14102360","14103740"," And then the goat was there."
"14105880","14110840"," And so when I was trading alone, I felt like I wanted to have somebody with me. "
"14111200","14112680"," Trading with me or just there in the background."
"14113320","14116640"," I didn't care if I was trading on my own or do my own thing or my own tick or"
"14116640","14116900"," whatever."
"14118200","14119680"," Just wanted a voice in the background. "
"14119960","14121060"," So it's like trading alone, you know."
"14123120","14127000"," And then of course I'm getting pissed off at retail, getting smoked."
"14127640","14134900"," And I think I made a recorded video or something and thought I would just do nightly recap videos. "
"14137460","14139140"," And evolved into this."
"14139620","14146980"," So the intent behind this is for you to have a companion piece with you all day long."
"14147160","14148600"," Another thing that was going on was. "
"14150460","14153740"," Thinkorswim was stopped like having a trade."
"14153940","14155640"," The news stopped being on thinkorswim."
"14156140","14160880"," I wasn't getting what I wanted from that broadcast as well that what they were doing on their radio"
"14160880","14161240"," broadcast. "
"14162100","14167080"," And so I was like, man, if somebody was just trading all day long Monday through Friday from open"
"14167080","14167500"," to close."
"14168680","14170260"," I'd really like to have that myself."
"14170740","14174480"," And so I've changed a lot of my trading habits. "
"14175720","14177400"," This is the answer to your question now."
"14178120","14183020"," I've changed a lot of my trading habits to adjust to being a daily stream."
"14183940","14188900"," So in stream right now we do highlight individual tickers. "
"14190660","14193860"," We do that on a weekly basis."
"14194120","14198840"," If you show up on a weekly basis, we line up trades for longer time periods."
"14199520","14202040"," So Friday we said, what do we say on Friday?"
"14202040","14207400"," We said, by next week Friday calls for 455 C, right?"
"14207780","14209500"," So if you're swing trading a weekly trade. "
"14210700","14215520"," But generally speaking, doing a live stream all day long, it's a challenge."
"14216880","14218060"," For us for me."
"14218360","14220640"," So I trade the good days, the bad days. "
"14220940","14223620"," I lose money on the bad days, of course right sideways days bad."
"14224560","14226780"," But I trade the dog shit, the good shit, all of it."
"14227180","14228140"," And I do that because. "
"14231420","14233380"," People trade when they want to trade."
"14234200","14238100"," And so I might not like personally, I probably wouldn't have traded this day."
"14238300","14238620"," It was me. "
"14239380","14239660"," Probably not."
"14240040","14240680"," Matter of fact, it's born."
"14240820","14241880"," I was talking to Joe and I said. "
"14242800","14244620"," I was like, send a text message to sport."
"14244620","14246980"," And I said, this is one of those days where I wouldn't trade."
"14247620","14249300"," But the key point is that. "
"14250420","14254220"," There are people that want to trade today and every day somebody wants to trade."
"14254400","14254760"," They have a job."
"14254980","14255460"," They have kids. "
"14255820","14256640"," They've got commitments."
"14258080","14259400"," Whatever it is, they have schooling."
"14259400","14260040"," Doesn't matter. "
"14260500","14261220"," They want to trade."
"14261520","14266140"," So my job here that I want to do is to try to educate a trader."
"14266440","14270540"," So this daily stream, some daily streamers, they'll just get off. "
"14270700","14272580"," They'll be like, I'm here for an hour and I'm out."
"14272800","14273700"," CLA, we're turning it off."
"14274620","14276680"," But what I'm trying to do is always be there. "
"14276860","14282080"," Or as best I can be there for people that are in the market day in, day out as a"
"14282080","14282660"," companion piece."
"14283420","14287800"," Now, if you're like, I want to learn to do something specific."
"14288600","14293120"," Or I want to only take swing trades or I only want to trade futures. "
"14294160","14298520"," Or I want to trade crypto or I want to trade whatever it is."
"14299800","14302260"," These are more like, this is more like lesson based."
"14302920","14305240"," And then you can apply this to anything, any time frame. "
"14305880","14307060"," But I would say get inside a discord."
"14307980","14311600"," And that's where we, that's where you would trade whatever you want to trade."
"14311600","14313200"," Whatever style you put most comfort with. "
"14314840","14315780"," If that makes sense."
"14316300","14319700"," The only thing in saying about doing this is I've become a better trader doing this every day."
"14321280","14322060"," Hands down. "
"14322540","14327560"," So I just, I've been day trading now for two and a half years, everything."
"14328460","14332300"," And I've lost a winning trader right now, but not like I used to be."
"14333080","14335120"," I've taken a hit on profit because of it. "
"14336220","14340160"," Not a huge hit, but big enough that it makes an impact."
"14341880","14344800"," So they get like big balance here of what we're doing, right?"
"14347980","14348460"," Yeah."
"14348880","14351360"," Um, spending time day trading to become a way better trader. "
"14353720","14357840"," I've had some fucking gnarly losses live on stream."
"14358260","14359580"," If you've only been here three weeks, right?"
"14359800","14360600"," I take losses here."
"14360660","14361020"," Big ones. "
"14362360","14367980"," So you will see me like come on to hung over or really tired and be like, fuck you."
"14367980","14370840"," We're going up and I will fucking torch a position."
"14370840","14371460"," Like big. "
"14373800","14376160"," So, and that's part of it too, right?"
"14376280","14378140"," You'll see me get angry in these streams sometimes."
"14379160","14380400"," You'll see you see it all."
"14380540","14383700"," You'll see me happy and you'll see me quite pissed off. "
"14384680","14390260"," Um, you'll see me be late to stream intentionally sometimes because I don't want you guys to freak"
"14390260","14394820"," out and think we're going down or freak out and think we're going up to free guys have some"
"14394820","14397580"," patience for the market to open up and breathe."
"14397580","14399680"," Um, you'll see it all here."
"14399820","14405780"," If you show up every day, you're going to see the life of an investor trader and how it goes. "
"14406320","14407500"," You know, you'll see the real deal."
"14407620","14409160"," You're not going to see like the furrow."
"14409740","14410620"," I'm always right. "
"14410940","14411420"," Never wrong."
"14415320","14417180"," Now, how long did it take me to get profitable?"
"14418360","14419300"," Uh, not long."
"14419820","14421220"," I've been trading a long time. "
"14421780","14423920"," How long did it take me to stop blowing up accounts?"
"14424840","14428340"," Um, maybe year eightish."
"14428900","14430980"," I had to blow up some big accounts to become."
"14431660","14433280"," I don't really blow up accounts anymore. "
"14433380","14434300"," I haven't done it in a long time."
"14435840","14438440"," I had to lose a lot though to have that happen."
"14439020","14441960"," It took big losses for me to size. "
"14442340","14444360"," I don't size up like I used to."
"14445820","14447140"," I'm way more conservative."
"14447400","14448860"," I know a lot more than I ever did. "
"14449320","14454440"," I knew a lot more even then when I started streaming, but, um, that's just time and market."
"14455000","14456280"," Oh, it's more than that."
"14456580","14458080"," I shouldn't say it's just time and market. "
"14458980","14461400"," There's parts to this education, right?"
"14462120","14463940"," You need like, um, need to read books."
"14464940","14466760"," You need people tell you don't, but you do."
"14466780","14467380"," You need to read books. "
"14467680","14473160"," You need to, um, consume some kind of video content, my view."
"14473520","14476460"," Uh, the options industry council has a great series."
"14477240","14482140"," Uh, if you really want to learn, you also want to be getting involved. "
"14482140","14482920"," You want to be involved with a group of traders."
"14483780","14485320"," Uh, that's why we have the discord, right?"
"14485500","14487480"," You want to get involved with people that actually trade."
"14488780","14490080"," Uh, the know how to make money. "
"14490540","14493640"," Uh, you want to be with around people that tell you, I'm long this."
"14493860","14494520"," I'm short this."
"14495280","14496080"," I'm closing this. "
"14496280","14497020"," I'm closing that."
"14497100","14497640"," I took a loss."
"14497880","14498360"," I took a win. "
"14499300","14505140"," That's important for you to see, um, people that are, that are able to survive or make money or be"
"14505140","14505440"," winners."
"14506220","14507280"," Uh, their behaviors."
"14508020","14509600"," So that's the other key part to this. "
"14510780","14514320"," There's some aspect to the social media news consumption."
"14515000","14517940"," I'm at a point though, man, where I gotta be honest with you."
"14519680","14524420"," I'm at a point, man, with like news and social media where. "
"14525780","14527200"," I'm getting pretty fucking salty."
"14527620","14531280"," Like, I'm not quite at the point of turning it off."
"14532340","14537600"," But the amount that I actually consume and believe and trust has gone near fucking zero. "
"14538280","14542420"," Like, I use it now for mostly awareness other than the awareness part of it."
"14543280","14544920"," I don't trust most of it anymore."
"14553250","14557470"," Um, yeah, you blow up a bit. "
"14557610","14561130"," You blow up a, you blow up a few accounts, like big ones."
"14561570","14562310"," You're in a fucking learn."
"14563290","14564570"," Um, you will learn. "
"14565190","14566250"," I assure you."
"14567890","14574170"," I've had these conversations in stream at times where, um, it's a fucking nightmare."
"14574170","14577710"," Uh, you'll stop trading too for periods of time. "
"14579930","14582590"," Uh, but it, how long does it take to become a winner?"
"14582850","14583690"," You can become a winner fast."
"14584130","14586310"," In the beginning, normally you will become a winner."
"14586470","14587270"," You'll have a couple of big trades. "
"14587510","14588130"," You'll think you're awesome."
"14589010","14592950"," Uh, then you start making those mistakes that make you a better trader."
"14594670","14597270"," Um, one of the key points though here is still. "
"14598550","14600710"," Time, like, time and markets probably number one."
"14601210","14605290"," Number two though is putting all the shit that you do in the, in the background together."
"14605750","14607090"," Trading with other people. "
"14607510","14608910"," Like, I think that's a very key part."
"14609230","14613210"," It was a very key part for me to become a, like, a confident trader."
"14614110","14620770"," Was having a winning trader tell me, um, the faults in my trade or the risks in my trade that"
"14620770","14622590"," I didn't see or how to manage a trade. "
"14623250","14624770"," How do we manage winners too?"
"14625670","14629410"," Uh, how to manage wing trades, how to manage losers, how not to take a bath."
"14630150","14632990"," Um, what do they see that I don't see?"
"14635010","14637370"," Uh, and then of course all the tools that actually work."
"14637750","14639990"," You know, there's tools that work and there's tools that don't work. "
"14640730","14642730"," Uh, and I've paid for a lot of them over the years."
"14642950","14645590"," As they come out, I'll buy them, I'll rent them, I'll lease them."
"14646430","14650530"," And to see if they actually work or not, if they give you an edge, some do, some don't. "
"14650990","14652090"," Some, it's not worth it."
"14654670","14655690"," Um, you know what I mean?"
"14658780","14659240"," Yeah."
"14659720","14661360"," NQ is trying to sell right now. "
"14661400","14661980"," Do you guys see it?"
"14663240","14667160"," It's like NDX is sitting on a 15, 8, 13 right now."
"14667740","14668780"," It's trying right now."
"14669320","14671360"," And Dixie is rolling over right now. "
"14671500","14673340"," Tesla's found a bar, a buyer."
"14675940","14677660"," The VIX is pumping right now."
"14677880","14679180"," So we might get a nice bloodbath here. "
"14680140","14680700"," Could get a bloodbath."
"14681100","14681400"," It's possible."
"14682340","14683660"," Could get a straight down bar right here. "
"14690230","14694810"," Another fascinating part about this market is, um, diamond hands, man."
"14695250","14697030"," Like diamond hands are the word right now."
"14699130","14700330"," People have itchy fingers. "
"14707420","14711820"," My wife is healthy as saying I just started trading two Fridays ago and I've been watching a stream"
"14711820","14713040"," every day since then."
"14713040","14716860"," I've learned more than last week and a half following you than I probably ever would."
"14717040","14718760"," Last week and a half would take me 10 years. "
"14719000","14719660"," Thanks, man."
"14719860","14720280"," Appreciate that."
"14721360","14722460"," Yeah, I keep sticking around. "
"14722780","14723720"," I'll be honest with you."
"14724120","14727700"," If you guys stick around with me, there's people in the stream that have been with me since the"
"14727700","14729960"," beginning and, um, stick around."
"14730120","14733700"," It's really, it's a, it's a great, you're not, you can't pay for this. "
"14734320","14735720"," Um, you can."
"14735920","14741000"," It's gonna cost you 30 grand, 20 grand, 10 grand, something like that."
"14741980","14742880"," Uh, it's free. "
"14743300","14744280"," Uh, we do a live stream every day."
"14744360","14744900"," It's fucking free."
"14745160","14747680"," So, uh, I don't take any sponsors. "
"14747680","14749660"," I don't do any advertising."
"14749980","14750800"," I don't do anything."
"14751440","14756180"," Um, so that's kind of, uh, that was kind of funny this morning. "
"14756180","14758600"," It was like, at, at attribution, like we're talking about attribution."
"14758860","14759860"," Motherfuckers getting free advertising."
"14760340","14762600"," Fucking book map gets free advertising for me every day. "
"14763120","14765180"," That's fucking pretty fucking mind."
"14766780","14774940"," Like, uh, you know, and that's what it is."
"14775220","14776500"," So stick around. "
"14776500","14779220"," Honestly, stick around for like a month, two months, three months."
"14780060","14781060"," Get inside the Discord."
"14781820","14784540"," And, uh, that was a nice community. "
"14785120","14790160"," It's not like, uh, someone yelling at you on Finn Twitter, someone yelling at you on, uh, Twitter"
"14790160","14791100"," or anything like that."
"14791360","14793500"," People care about, uh, about you getting better."
"14794140","14795360"," There's a guy in there, John L."
"14795580","14799040"," There's David AMS. Those guys are fucking ballers, man."
"14799760","14801460"," Like fucking baller traders."
"14801920","14803580"," I'd put them up against anybody trading. "
"14804300","14804540"," Anybody."
"14806040","14806960"," Um, anyone?"
"14809880","14811540"," I wouldn't fucking fade, David."
"14812260","14812860"," Fuck no. "
"14814420","14816400"," Fuck no when I, when I fade in."
"14819760","14820680"," Yeah, it's weird."
"14820940","14822820"," Like, we weren't in diamond hands before, right?"
"14823040","14823820"," We're a lot of volatility. "
"14824100","14828200"," And now it's like, we're in this fucking place where you have to kind of diamond hand."
"14828460","14829460"," I hate diamond handing."
"14830600","14833100"," It shows the sloppiness of the market. "
"14833240","14836380"," It shows right now that you can just throw a dart to fucking board."
"14837060","14839620"," It's a really bad place for a new trainer."
"14840320","14842760"," Uh, this is where we create the worst trainers. "
"14843460","14844700"," I don't know if you know this or not."
"14845520","14847740"," Um, if you're a new trainer right now, right?"
"14848580","14852400"," Some of the worst habits you'll form are in this market right now."
"14852880","14859000"," Uh, because you can basically diamond hand and win six, seven, eight, nine trades. "
"14859680","14865960"," You're likely going to go through three or six months of reinforcing that you're a great trainer."
"14866640","14872420"," And then you're going to go through, uh, a correction or a risk off events and you're going to give"
"14872420","14873540"," back all that fucking money."
"14874140","14878900"," Uh, you will actually learn in those events though, how to be a tactful trader. "
"14890470","14891310"," Oh, yeah."
"14891750","14892150"," Oh, dude."
"14892350","14895970"," It's like it even makes it even makes people like I'm sloppy right now. "
"14895970","14896610"," I'm like, fuck it."
"14896670","14897830"," Just buy some calls and leave them on."
"14898350","14900030"," I'm like, I already know it's fucking going up. "
"14900030","14900830"," It doesn't fucking matter."
"14901610","14908430"," And if it doesn't, I'm still putting the risk out there because the, the chance of it going up is"
"14908430","14909370"," 70%."
"14909370","14910950"," No matter where I am. "
"14911590","14914490"," So if it burns, oops, I burnt one out of 10."
"14916490","14923630"," Like, you're like, yeah, this, where we are in the market is a sloppy trade."
"14923630","14926230"," And this is where you make bad habits. "
"14941440","14943080"," Is that the line drawn for today?"
"14943280","14943480"," Yeah."
"14943820","14944520"," Well, they're trying."
"14945200","14948520"," They got, they got time as problem for sellers right now. "
"14948920","14950060"," Time is not good for sellers."
"14950760","14952320"," More time we spend down here."
"14952480","14956980"," The more this hourly trigger comes up and it's going to want to push the market up. "
"14958060","14962920"," Uh, you want to see if you're selling, you want to see good, fast, hard moves to the downside."
"14963780","14967440"," Um, although they're trying to push H, Y, G down right now."
"14967440","14970120"," They're trying to push NASDAQ down right now. "
"14970560","14972360"," Uh, Vix is rising."
"14972360","14974760"," It's kind of bearish like looking at it on the surface."
"14974760","14976620"," It looks good for a downside move. "
"14980370","14981670"," They're trying, man."
"14984670","14986670"," They're trying to sell this right now."
"14989830","14991730"," Hey, David, David's here right now. "
"14994510","14997670"," It says, I remember how these guys got burned after COVID."
"14997830","14997910"," Yep."
"14999670","15003670"," When they turned came up, they were still buying dip 1000 points down was the opposite of what we"
"15003670","15004290"," have had now. "
"15004290","15004550"," Yep."
"15004670","15004950"," Absolutely."
"15008470","15010510"," Yeah, we got John Haggerty here in the room. "
"15010530","15012590"," He always gives you his positioning."
"15013070","15015150"," Like John Haggerty is in chat right now on YouTube."
"15015230","15019750"," He's always telling you when he's long, when he's short, win or lose, right?"
"15019750","15021750"," We have trainers in our chat that do that too. "
"15036640","15037960"," Yeah, it's killing me, man."
"15038080","15041100"," This is making my, I already know this shit's going to take until 230."
"15041920","15044180"," It's fucking 230 is right here. "
"15044400","15044500"," Right."
"15044620","15045800"," My cursor is that's 230."
"15047200","15048860"," It's like fucking a man. "
"15049000","15049700"," Just get it done."
"15050060","15052720"," And you got buyers down here that are just waiting."
"15053920","15056840"," You're just hoping that it come down here and slam this up. "
"15063600","15064340"," Hey, Johnny."
"15064340","15068300"," Yeah, you know they're stepping in."
"15068480","15070140"," I already, I'm, I'm ready. "
"15070380","15071520"," Like they come down here."
"15071520","15072860"," I want to buy this dip."
"15073860","15075340"," I have some fucking lutely. "
"15087280","15088080"," Here's your pivot."
"15094090","15095390"," Come on, dude."
"15097110","15098710"," Failed the PT one here. "
"15098830","15099650"," Can you get it now?"
"15100070","15100550"," Come on."
"15107580","15108180"," What's that?"
"15113190","15117660"," All right, I'll take me."
"15118120","15119520"," I've been very busy right now. "
"15119540","15123220"," It's been very hard for me to have a lot going on right now."
"15124320","15126800"," I'm not having the time that I expect to have."
"15127020","15132680"," As a matter of fact, I've got a meeting tonight now at 5 p.m. I'm getting like so yesterday. "
"15133980","15142360"," I got stuck, but yesterday I took my kids school shopping to get it done and out of the way"
"15142360","15143320"," before the mad rush."
"15144020","15145540"," That shit took all night long."
"15146000","15147000"," It was all night long. "
"15147140","15148960"," I was, I didn't get done until 9 30 10."
"15149780","15151940"," I got down on the stream immediately."
"15153160","15155120"," Off and run and trying to take care of my children. "
"15155120","15156840"," Make sure that they're ready to go for school."
"15161420","15164540"," I'm doing that early because they don't want to be like mad rush."
"15164700","15166640"," You ever like, you ever need to have kids, right?"
"15167000","15170200"," Like you come in like school season and it's like a shit show. "
"15170360","15172600"," They're all fighting like pigeons over a parking lot."
"15172600","15175420"," For clothes and fucking school supplies."
"15175700","15178940"," The teachers are giving you shit to buy for the classroom and all that stuff. "
"15179160","15181560"," I was like, fuck this."
"15181700","15182560"," We're getting this done now."
"15192980","15194120"," That's been really busy. "
"15205770","15210170"," Yeah, that's what I took them to."
"15210170","15219970"," I went on to Reddit and then I searched where to go shopping for back to school"
"15219970","15220550"," clothes."
"15221450","15223570"," And there were some really cool posts in there. "
"15223770","15227030"," They were like, gave a list of stores to go to."
"15227510","15233370"," You can, I guess you can get like a fall clothes in summer for really cheap."
"15234250","15236170"," I don't know if it's really fucking cheap, dude. "
"15236170","15237210"," Kids clothes."
"15237590","15238490"," So this is the thing."
"15238630","15241030"," So this is like the first thing I did was this. "
"15241990","15245890"," My kids love shopping at secondhand thrift stores."
"15246930","15248510"," So they went and did all that."
"15249870","15251710"," And they spent a bunch of money there. "
"15251970","15257290"," Then I took them out to get the rest of their clothing to round out their clothes for school."
"15258590","15263130"," Like new athletic clothes and tops and whatever it is they wanted."
"15265350","15272010"," And so we went to four different stores that were like regular new clothing stores. "
"15272290","15275150"," But even that was a fucking thousand bucks a kid."
"15275650","15278470"," So that's just not cheap."
"15278730","15280250"," Like kids are not fucking cheap. "
"15280550","15286010"," Like kids are in the worst part is that they grow out of this stuff."
"15286390","15287970"," Like you get, do you start racking up?"
"15288330","15290150"," I'm, in fact, that was just those stores."
"15290890","15295370"," So I went and got them new shoes and sneakers and boots. "
"15296570","15297170"," Pat's gloves."
"15297910","15299490"," I ordered that stuff from gear trade."
"15301530","15303130"," You see that bottom and right here?"
"15305450","15309050"," Like all this stuff is stupid expensive and the kids are always growing. "
"15309810","15314410"," And then it becomes this big question like how much like we used when the kids were younger, we"
"15314410","15317210"," would try to do my wife had time."
"15317210","15318430"," She was like stay at home mom."
"15319150","15323430"," And like she would have like groups of people would try to close with each other. "
"15324590","15327250"," Like kids are like, kid like babies."
"15327550","15329150"," They're like baby through toddler and stuff."
"15329890","15334390"," The clothes are so expensive that people are like, I got this great stuff from Patagonia. "
"15334630","15337850"," I'll give you all the stuff or you pay me half-word or something."
"15338570","15342570"," Now in these years now they're like pre-teens and it's always something new."
"15343350","15347370"," And it's like I knew this and fucking knew that. "
"15347630","15352890"," And my wife was like, oh the style has changed this year for kids."
"15353190","15356730"," They've gone from brake colors to birth tones again."
"15357230","15357990"," And I'm like, oh really?"
"15364310","15367510"," Just buy them a dog clothes and save them up to make them smaller. "
"15372070","15372950"," Yeah exactly."
"15375510","15377570"," I show you that that's what they're doing right now."
"15377630","15379350"," They're back in the earth tones I guess again. "
"15379350","15380870"," I guess that's back in style again."
"15382050","15384790"," Like Bohemian look to it maybe?"
"15390970","15392410"," Yeah, yeah I like the hand-me-downs."
"15393810","15400570"," And my youngest daughter is like very like, she's very like tomboys. "
"15400570","15403550"," She's always active, always getting dirty."
"15406290","15408930"," She's like holes in her clothes and they're dirty."
"15410410","15412070"," She'll go run around in the mud. "
"15412490","15414310"," My oldest is really clean, well-kept."
"15414950","15419090"," The youngest is like, let's go on a week-long through-hike daddy."
"15422170","15426550"," And so the youngest is like, where are your shoes?"
"15427030","15428770"," We'll have a blowout over here in this toe. "
"15428770","15430430"," Or I'm like, look at that jacket."
"15430870","15433250"," It's like a tear on it from tree skiing with me."
"15434430","15436430"," I'm like, shit, need new clothes. "
"15439870","15441070"," Come on."
"15445900","15448000"," Can't even get PT1."
"15449280","15451920"," New higher low right now for bowls. "
"15452660","15454580"," Coming into 141 right now."
"15455300","15456880"," Higher low for bowls."
"15460690","15461590"," Time's a wasting. "
"15464150","15466290"," Oh man, dude, bears, I don't know."
"15469100","15471200"," I'd be real fucking careful here if you were a bear."
"15471900","15473020"," If you're a seller here, be careful. "
"15486970","15489190"," Come on, bears, you need one big red bar."
"15492350","15494050"," I gotta check a five minute real quick."
"15495150","15496690"," This is reversing right now. "
"15503150","15506110"," It's not quite there yet, but it's reversing."
"15506110","15517960"," Be really"
"15519720","15520260"," careful here."
"15520420","15521660"," Not careful, but..."
"15522920","15525720"," Sellers need a nice big fat red bar down right here. "
"15525900","15527800"," Bam, bam, bam, capitulation move."
"15533460","15537900"," If bears lose 4.55, 31, we're going to reverse it."
"15541340","15548390"," I'm going to pay attention to this candle right here. "
"15557890","15561130"," You don't want to see this candle close above."
"15579990","15581470"," Yeah, you see that poor low."
"15582190","15583570"," I see that poor low too. "
"15595670","15596550"," Bright cars."
"15596850","15600670"," I will say this, my youngest, she bought a bunch of shirts."
"15601850","15602550"," And they were really cool. "
"15602750","15604550"," They were all like, it's good to be happy."
"15604550","15610310"," Happy days, like sunshine, rainbows, like words and stuff."
"15610830","15614110"," I was like, I was like, really?"
"15614890","15616030"," She was like, yes, daddy. "
"15616190","15616830"," I was like, all right."
"15619010","15626070"," My wife was there, and it was hilarious because my wife's like, my daughter, of course, is looking"
"15626070","15627030"," for me to say yes."
"15627930","15631130"," My wife was like, hell no, you're not buying that perfect white shirt. "
"15631130","15634090"," And she, my daughter's looking at me."
"15634230","15635690"," If I'm going to give her the go ahead on it."
"15640290","15641090"," Oh, there. "
"15641210","15642130"," See that right there?"
"15643210","15644110"," Big old squeeze."
"15644450","15645930"," I'm still in this game right now."
"15646330","15652410"," Still haven't been fucking still haven't been stopped out of this trade. "
"15656690","15657570"," Come on."
"15666340","15668860"," I feel so bad for bears here."
"15673110","15675530"," Like just a quick bloodbath down. "
"15676250","15686440"," Yeah, you're"
"15686440","15687160"," watching it right."
"15687580","15690260"," Got to close above the six EMA just then."
"15690540","15692060"," We're looking for a reversal here. "
"15692120","15692960"," We'll see if we can get it."
"15694580","15696400"," Here comes the reversal almost."
"15696700","15697000"," We'll see. "
"15697380","15698620"," You can see it, right?"
"15701980","15706060"," Pulls with a new low, but a five minute candle right now."
"15708720","15709620"," Or a new high."
"15709840","15710000"," Sorry. "
"15710120","15711660"," I said high a low, but I meant high."
"15718520","15722780"," Yeah, we're getting a squeeze."
"15723200","15726920"," It's not guaranteed yet, but it's looking like it. "
"15726920","15728920"," I'll leave this up for a minute."
"15731060","15733780"," But it's looking like a squeeze to me."
"15733840","15735080"," It's smelling like a squeeze. "
"15737020","15738340"," This was it."
"15738500","15739800"," This was the candle right here."
"15740480","15741680"," That one right there. "
"15745200","15748980"," This was the tell right here."
"15750120","15751940"," They needed that really bad."
"15752180","15754980"," They needed to get that PT one to at least stay alive. "
"15756400","15759420"," That candle was not a good candle for sellers."
"15760460","15762180"," That was a bad candle."
"15764780","15766680"," It's still alive right now. "
"15767460","15772820"," Sellers still alive, but I wouldn't want to see that candle."
"15774320","15777480"," For sellers to stay alive, I would have I wanted to see."
"15780740","15783460"," At least at least the close down here. "
"15784560","15784980"," Minimum."
"15787180","15789820"," Preferably they at least tagged this PT one."
"15790020","15790580"," They didn't get it. "
"15791140","15792180"," So they fucking lose."
"15792460","15794820"," And what's that showing you is that there's demand here."
"15795500","15802560"," What it's showing you is that buyers have been coming up like the bids as time has passed is now"
"15802560","15804560"," coming up and there's demand right there. "
"15804560","15805520"," Right."
"15805740","15808180"," So this is strong demand right here."
"15808520","15816260"," And what it's going to do is it's going to force price higher and check to see if these sellers"
"15816260","15818020"," are strong right here. "
"15818760","15822140"," So now you've got very strong buyers right here."
"15822740","15827840"," And we're going to check to see how strong these guys are right up right here right where we are"
"15827840","15828380"," right now."
"15829600","15832220"," So we're going to coiling to an extent right. "
"15832760","15837560"," I'm going to coil, coil, coil and find out and get a move out of this."
"15838140","15840320"," But this is not a good move right here."
"15841140","15843160"," That was a not a good candle for sellers. "
"15843660","15845820"," So looks like a reversal to me early."
"15846600","15848980"," An early reversal can't call it yet though."
"15849440","15850960"," I'd like to see the break above. "
"15851620","15853540"," I'd like to see a green candle here."
"15855640","15858420"," And then I'd like to see a defense of that candle."
"15858880","15860780"," You know that kind of stuff you can see it right there. "
"15861760","15863880"," And then boom the upside."
"15864880","15868420"," Run over these fucking bulls and you're going to get you'll take it to like right here."
"15870380","15872480"," There might be a little bit of all right there too. "
"15872600","15882440"," But now Zach with a pretty clean bounce right now."
"15882440","15884620"," HYG with a pretty clean bounce right now."
"15885060","15886900"," Tesla basing right now. "
"15887220","15889620"," Apple ready to make a move higher."
"15890140","15890880"," Get out of the way man."
"15891020","15892040"," If you're a bull or bear. "
"15892820","15894380"," If you're short right now be careful."
"15895120","15897560"," That's not not financial advice."
"15898480","15899340"," Be careful here. "
"15902380","15903140"," Not fun."
"15903280","15903920"," Not NFA."
"15904160","15904480"," Not financial. "
"15904720","15908300"," It's just be be very cognizant of where we are."
"15917400","15918640"," Change that to yellow."
"15921260","15925960"," I'll still leave these down here for you but I'm going to give you caution here at least. "
"15928560","15930540"," Great caution here if you're a bear."

"16521910","16526490"," And we get a nice red bar down and then a good report blast up here."

"16531490","16533450"," The market looks like it wants to go up here right?"
"16533610","16533970"," We know that."
"16535509","16538410"," So maybe it's one fifty nine. "

"16646630","16648110"," I want to be clear about something here."
"16648970","16650790"," I was talking to Joe this morning. "
"16652090","16653869"," And you're like days like today."
"16655490","16658050"," If you guys are like full port in your account."
"16658390","16659270"," I want to tell you this is a very. "
"16659810","16663450"," I put this in your in your trader rule book somewhere."
"16665090","16666110"," Days like today."
"16668250","16671890"," They should be like fun days or a lot of days. "
"16672669","16675610"," If you're like basing your whole account on a day like today."
"16676110","16677130"," You're in the wrong profession."
"16679509","16683310"," They're so like whether we're trading up or down. "
"16684070","16685950"," When we're on like a vent days like this."
"16687250","16688210"," It's kind of like."
"16690730","16692770"," You know it's like amateur hour right. "
"16693009","16695710"," Like a new trader new investor they care about these days."
"16696730","16697849"," There was a time in the market."
"16698009","16698710"," You may not know this. "
"16699470","16701130"," This will tell you who's got time in market."
"16702550","16707369"," There was a time when earnings weren't an event."
"16708310","16710250"," Earnings have not been an event forever. "
"16711050","16712650"," This is a very recent phenomena."
"16713570","16714890"," We're earnings mattered."
"16717349","16719349"," So these are like a vent driven. "
"16720090","16723390"," Right involves going to come off these events now."
"16724070","16725169"," Once they're done."
"16725810","16727970"," And so like if you're basing. "
"16729490","16732710"," If you're basing like I'm trying to grow an account on a day like today."
"16733250","16734250"," It's not fucking worth it."
"16734250","16739830"," It's like one of those days where the market's going to do the functions that it needs to do. "
"16740430","16741130"," You're likely."
"16743290","16744290"," Tunnel visioned."
"16744730","16745810"," Very subjective. "
"16748369","16751150"," On the how critical a day like today is."
"16751270","16752490"," And the dealers know this."
"16753849","16755570"," So you're like hyper focused. "
"16756290","16760369"," And in fact they're just going to take all your money away from you and say thanks for playing at"
"16760369","16760750"," the casino."
"16761189","16762250"," Now saying that."
"16763390","16768689"," There are better days where the market just moves in a normal fashion up and down and you can make"
"16768689","16769310"," a lot of money. "
"16770529","16772270"," So this shouldn't be your day."
"16773189","16775630"," Or like this is going to make a break me or something like that."
"16776330","16776910"," You know what I'm saying. "
"16790530","16791330"," The doom."
"16791930","16795270"," Yeah, so it's like it's like that's one of those days."
"16796310","16797290"," I'm saying a quick break. "
"16797770","16798790"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"16799450","16800910"," You saw here right."
"16801150","16803450"," So if you guys want to ask Joe, you can ask him. "
"16804430","16807070"," I could sort in the phone and call them up and I'm like."
"16807450","16808530"," It's one of those days man."
"16808770","16810150"," I'm like I don't even want to go on stream today. "
"16810610","16812190"," I'm like they get everybody all pulled up."
"16812590","16813690"," They're going to get stuck."
"16814430","16818090"," And then they're going to be married to their position into the twenty first. "
"16819970","16824970"," So you know you're going to live and die by this sort as a bull or a bear or whatever"
"16824970","16826670"," your positioning is."
"16826830","16828330"," So it looks like it right now."
"16830910","16836410"," You know what we're going to trade the clothes here today and I'll be right back with you just a"
"16836410","16836830"," few minutes. "
"16841730","17003960"," So make"
"17003960","17007560"," a note that you have a recovery right now in small caps tonight."
"17007820","17013140"," That's shaping up pretty good Amazon coming back down to check its five minutes been grinding"
"17013140","17014420"," higher all day long."
"17015180","17019160"," We're also got a little bit of a recovery on Netflix right now. "
"18266730","18267810"," All right I'm back."
"18271930","18272870"," Went potty."
"18273750","18274830"," I forgot to get water. "
"18276770","18277670"," And then I made a phone call."
"18279430","18281730"," I had some I've got some discord things I got to do."
"18282670","18286410"," So we're down right now into the two twenty eight right now. "
"18287070","18293010"," You're getting a nice new you get in that cell that panic cell into two thirty in the afternoon."
"18293790","18298170"," You're likely seeing a bull's here had a chance to bring it up."
"18298290","18299850"," They got sent back to the downside. "
"18301010","18306210"," You've got more than likely people exiting their calls on tech."
"18307610","18313650"," You've got sellers with a hedge in the market on tech hoping that they can get a downside move into"
"18313650","18314870"," the end of the day."
"18316850","18318350"," Let me see if you'll look here. "
"18318350","18320190"," HYG recovering right now."
"18321070","18324610"," That's now where now at the two third at two twenty nine right now in the afternoon."
"18324970","18327110"," There is a five minute on a five minute chart. "
"18327290","18332830"," You've got a five minute bear flat or bear plane here forming up and get the red line coming down."
"18332830","18334510"," You've got the white line coming down."
"18335190","18339230"," Sellers want to capitalize on that right here and move this stuff. "
"18340350","18346190"," And see if they can have continued downside movements get a reversal right here to the downside tag"
"18346190","18347090"," that hourly trigger."
"18350110","18352230"," Move that HT over so you can see it."
"18352470","18365960"," Make sure it's on the right time frame for fifty"
"18365960","18366720"," three seventy. "
"18367460","18368940"," So it has moved up now."
"18371420","18372460"," Right up here."
"18377360","18379160"," Paying close attention to this. "
"18379200","18380360"," If you don't know what I'm talking about here."
"18380440","18383220"," I'm going to explain it to you really quick in a second here."
"18385640","18389640"," Bears trying to confirm a directional change in the market. "
"18392420","18395020"," So watch the red and white line."
"18397060","18399200"," Trying to get a trend change."
"18400760","18403220"," Now I want to draw your attention right here. "
"18404060","18406640"," And then also your attention right here as we get close."
"18407780","18413560"," Right you need that confirmation that we're going lower so you want to see closing rejection down"
"18413560","18413820"," below."
"18414820","18417460"," Without that it becomes a by the dip situation. "
"18417460","18423220"," Not a salary situation so even though you're scared here or you're scared that we're going to"
"18423220","18423500"," crash."
"18424280","18427760"," Now you have the hourly trigger as support creeping up down below."
"18428340","18431260"," And I want to show you what that directional change looks like. "
"18431760","18435040"," Price white red pretty fairly easy to see."
"18436500","18440680"," When you see a directional change this shows you how long it's been since we've gone down."
"18441260","18445840"," You'll see white line goes below the red price goes below the white. "
"18445840","18449920"," And you'll get a directional trend change to the downside."
"18450640","18455460"," So this is the hope of sellers is that they can close this right."
"18455660","18460960"," You'll see a rejection here in the white line if we're going to switch to the downside. "
"18461280","18466900"," If we do switch to the downside here and we can get underneath the hourly trigger."
"18467540","18471620"," You'll see a three trigger bull cluster to the downside."
"18472280","18478540"," You'd want to see price break below or reject here break below reject here and they will have a"
"18478540","18481740"," directional change that could last multiple days. "
"18482480","18488400"," Now so if you're a seller out here you're probably pumped and hoping that you're going to get that"
"18488400","18489300"," reversal here."
"18489840","18493100"," So let me know if you're uber bearish here or not."
"18493560","18499020"," You're watching all of that all of that bear porn right here. "
"18499020","18502580"," All of a sudden comes right back up here."
"18503340","18505380"," So here's your chance if you're a bull."
"18505840","18509980"," If you wanted to like let's say you're like oh my god my shit's bird I'm in trouble here or"
"18509980","18510780"," something like that. "
"18511360","18517260"," You have your chance right now to exit calls if you want."
"18518400","18520160"," You've got hourly trigger down here."
"18521460","18526520"," So we'll see if the bears can confirm a move. "
"18526960","18527480"," Hold on a second here."
"18529140","18530520"," A move lower."
"18531940","18536300"," So right in here we're going to find out if they get their move to the downside into this bell. "
"18536800","18539200"," We've got an hour and a half until the close right now."
"18539740","18545740"," We'll see if the bears can hold on and I guess I was just talking to Joe real quick and"
"18545740","18546440"," I was like man."
"18546760","18552000"," I was like can they get like a sell the news on on tassel. "
"18552120","18557460"," I just noticed that tassel tagged to 299.29 today."
"18557460","18559500"," I didn't even know that they tagged it earlier."
"18559720","18561440"," I just looked at it just now for the first time. "
"18561860","18563240"," They actually did tag 300."
"18565520","18568440"," So where is tassel.js?"
"18569140","18576240"," We called it down at what was it 156 or something right when we're trading 156 or something like"
"18576240","18576440"," that."
"18578700","18580140"," Maybe he's in here right now. "
"18581220","18582380"," Yeah I'm still long here."
"18582460","18583100"," I haven't sold nothing."
"18584180","18585500"," I'm long right now. "
"18590510","18593050"," So we'll see if the bears can confirm this."
"18593190","18594490"," They're going to want to turn this down."
"18595010","18598710"," What you'll end up seeing if it does turn down and you'll see this red line come down. "
"18598910","18600930"," You'll see the white line come down right here."
"18601710","18606230"," You'll see price reject right here and then it'll start bleeding down to the downside."
"18606830","18610670"," I'm not going to get bearish unless we start doing this kind of nonsense right here and confirm. "
"18611430","18612730"," Then I'll get bearish right there."
"18613510","18615250"," No bearishness for me at this point."
"18616110","18617270"," 2.30 in the afternoon. "
"18617590","18623690"," Very boring day in the marketplace right where where are we right now right at the opening price."
"18624350","18625810"," Nothing's changed fundamentally."
"18626530","18627750"," You can see it right there. "
"18627870","18631370"," That's the opening price for all the noise inside the market."
"18631370","18634550"," We watched apple rip faces off and then sell down."
"18636090","18641770"," So still nothing from my end that I can see what would like to see this though continue if we're"
"18641770","18642670"," going to get bearish here. "
"18643450","18648110"," I'm trying to make trade this close on Tesla ER."
"18649090","18656050"," Now the fact that we already tagged 300 makes me wonder if we can get down to 282 on Tesla."
"18656750","18661010"," My one concern with it is how long does that hold?"
"18661810","18670610"," It's like can we trade 282 after the bell but does it recover to like two two ninety one by"
"18670610","18671450"," open tomorrow. "
"18671450","18673590"," Then they kill all the options."
"18674210","18678210"," So I'm fascinated possibly possibly fascinated."
"18678550","18679170"," What was that?"
"18679830","18680950"," Hold on here. "
"18681590","18684310"," I lost my whole screen there."
"18686290","18687510"," What's going on here."
"18688190","18689830"," I was wondering if it's possible. "
"18692230","18698130"," If it's possible to."
"18705320","18707120"," If it's possible to."
"18713870","18716050"," Take that trade down to 282. "
"18716690","18720270"," Because we did hit the implied not implied pretty close to it."
"18720730","18723570"," We hit the whole center."
"18724230","18726530"," I'm going to turn this shit off over here. "
"18728210","18730230"," Time to be right back."
"18730890","18731710"," And then."
"18734610","18738490"," Bull's recovering right now on the possible bear. "
"18740690","18745110"," Bear plane right price now trading four fifty five nineteen."
"18746930","18750150"," What a fucking slow ass day."
"18757520","18761140"," Yeah, I saw two twenty nine point two nine. "
"18762860","18765740"," Two twenty nine point two twenty nine point two twenty nine point two nine."
"18770590","18772490"," What I'd say that's three hundred."
"18772890","18773770"," That's what I would say. "
"18773850","18774930"," I would say that that's three hundred."
"18776310","18780690"," We were calling it down at 156 and it tagged two ninety nine twenty nine."
"18780690","18781850"," I'm calling that three hundred. "
"18782710","18784810"," I think that's three hundred."
"18789700","18790760"," Well, so."
"18800160","18802320"," Yeah, there's not there's no movement here. "
"18802320","18803800"," We're actually green right now."
"18806360","18808500"," We're green on the day right now."
"18811200","18813560"," Recovery right now and Nasdaq. "
"18814880","18817460"," Tesla's still selling down trade two ninety one."
"18820850","18825010"," We've got VIX coming up to trade thirteen seventy right now."
"18825410","18826310"," Look at that. "
"18827410","18835710"," There's a gap to close on VIX at thirteen seventy one so might get a good pivot there."
"18840850","18843390"," Put a line there to just."
"18843390","18845870"," Good note it. "
"18858290","18861450"," H Y G with a recovery for the moment right now."
"18934260","18936080"," I'm adding to a position here."
"18936180","18936700"," Hold on here. "
"18936900","18938520"," Trying to like add to a position."
"18958980","18966460"," There's a five hundred twenty two thousand calls implied today on four fifty six C's."
"18971950","18973970"," Five hundred twenty two thousand right now. "
"18990280","18995040"," Yeah, no go for the sellers still still no sell signal here."
"18995700","18998980"," Sellers are going to need to rope this straight down if they can."
"19001820","19004100"," No go for sellers right now. "
"19005400","19007920"," No follow through for sellers."
"19015170","19017810"," What a fucking I bleeder this is."

"19060310","19062450"," Sorry about that."
"19064030","19065370"," No go right now."
"19074880","19075840"," I'm still long. "
"19076080","19076800"," I haven't sold shit."

"19079380","19081320"," So still sitting here waiting."
"19082020","19089340"," I'm in the I'm in the I'm in the Lotto trade for Tesla and Netflix to fucking."
"19089340","19090840"," Well, Netflix I'm like. "
"19092860","19096940"," Netflix I think they're going to have good earnings because they're charging everybody now."
"19097720","19100040"," So I think they're going to have a great report."
"19102440","19104920"," They're going to have shitty guidance I think. "
"19105540","19109900"," They're going to tell you something like we've got a we've got a catalog of TV shows and movies."
"19112060","19114000"," But their earnings should be outstanding."
"19116460","19118400"," So I think that's good Tesla. "
"19118880","19120080"," I'm trading this for a."
"19121240","19123260"," I'm trading this for surprise."
"19124780","19127540"," Nothing earnings, but the well the earnings."
"19127540","19128360"," I think they're going to win. "
"19128500","19128840"," They're going to be."
"19130760","19135380"," And then I think they beat their ER and then I think their guidance is going to be out of"
"19135380","19135640"," control."
"19135900","19136340"," Awesome. "
"19137340","19139140"," I think they're going to say something stupid."
"19141480","19142120"," You know."
"19142860","19147680"," Well, this one I figure I'll have to trade it this cute this quarter and Q two or Q three"
"19147680","19148240"," and Q four. "
"19148940","19150720"," Whatever stupid stuff they do."
"19151760","19154620"," I'm assuming at this point we're going to get some kind of stupid announcement."
"19155000","19156840"," They haven't had a stupid announcement sometime. "
"19157560","19162160"," It's been like how many quarters do you think it's been since they've had a crazy announcement."
"19162940","19163340"," Eight?"
"19163580","19164120"," No, maybe not eight."
"19165200","19166600"," Four, five, six. "
"19167320","19169000"," So six maybe eight."
"19169200","19169780"," Yeah, eight quarters."
"19171340","19174260"," Eight quarters that I can think of like something stupid. "
"19176740","19177460"," They're due."
"19182220","19185340"," Trading 30 cents right now and four 50 sixes."
"19190860","19191800"," It's been a while. "
"19192760","19194380"," Even if you're not a Tesla bull, it's like."
"19195060","19196680"," If you know anything about Tesla."
"19198220","19199740"," Even if you're not a Tesla bull. "
"19200980","19206120"," They're getting close to getting like long in the tooth like you get like eight to 10 years without"
"19206120","19208520"," some fucking stupid shit that they say."
"19209100","19210120"," It's like."
"19213180","19217920"," I'm assuming it's got to maybe it has to do with cyber truck or it has to do with AI"
"19217920","19218700"," or something. "
"19218700","19223980"," Something just straight stupid news to be like fuck."
"19225600","19226500"," Stock split."
"19226800","19227660"," I don't know what it is. "
"19233700","19237720"," Yeah, I traded it the other day and took three percent in the overnight or something."
"19238540","19241640"," It took like three percent on the opening bell in the first 15 minutes."
"19242640","19243620"," It was awesome. "
"19245220","19246100"," Made bank."
"19251110","19252630"," Yeah, it's something stupid like that."
"19262350","19264070"," H.I.G. looking bullish again. "
"19264790","19267550"," Vic's coming in to close a gap above at 1371."
"19268310","19269690"," Apple still looking bullish."
"19270470","19272270"," Apple is actually a really good play here. "
"19273170","19274110"," I like Apple."
"19274130","19275710"," I was thinking of buying some right here."
"19275770","19276370"," Believe it or not. "
"19277650","19280390"," I never would have thought that I would buy Apple at $195."
"19281110","19283810"," But that whole Nvidia thing is not going to fuck around."
"19283990","19285210"," They're going to run that shit up. "
"19286070","19287630"," Next to liquidity my ass."
"19287910","19289770"," They're going to run that shit up."
"19301540","19303320"," Yeah, I like that. "
"19303480","19313140"," From my viewpoint, I'm like, if I trade this, if I trade like 10 grand three"
"19313140","19317440"," times, only one of them needs to hit like five or six hundred percent."
"19317660","19318000"," I'll be a winner."
"19318000","19324480"," So if I do it this next three quarters, I think that no matter what, I come out the winner. "
"19325640","19331080"," Like just pure statistics that one of these one of these quarters, some stupid is going to be said."
"19340040","19342640"," Yeah, I'm looking for like the zero date."
"19342720","19346660"," Not well, not zero, but for Tasso, it'd be the 21st expiry. "
"19347520","19349220"," It's kind of like something stupid."
"19353320","19354380"," Yeah, I like Rivian."
"19354640","19355640"," I'm bullish on Rivian. "
"19355720","19356080"," Very bullish."
"19356880","19358260"," I was bullish on that dip buy too."
"19360920","19362480"," So we're just playing a waiting game. "
"19362620","19364000"," It's 2.46 in the afternoon."
"19364720","19366940"," That really is a waiting game at this point."
"19367200","19367840"," You're tied in. "
"19368000","19368800"," You place your bets."
"19369060","19375240"," We've talked all morning nonstop on what you what you can or can't do here."
"19379600","19382000"," No joy in anybody that was short yesterday. "
"19382000","19383080"," You can see that, right?"
"19383800","19385220"," Anyone short in here?"
"19385580","19385960"," No joy."
"19386680","19387200"," Nonzero."
"19388020","19388680"," You get nothing. "
"19389520","19391300"," You're actually losing money once again."
"19392720","19398380"," So no joy down here for anyone the top ticket is hasn't made a fucking dollar."
"19399300","19402520"," If anything, they were they were given a chance to get out. "
"19402920","19403680"," That was it."
"19404460","19406040"," So no joy for sellers."
"19407340","19412320"," No joy for, well, I guess buyers had some joy up here, but no real joy at this point. "
"19414340","19418100"," You should be locked in for your decisions heading into the end of the day."
"19420840","19422880"," On your expectation of where it moves."
"19423080","19423980"," It's kind of funny too. "
"19424080","19425280"," I'm looking at Tesla and I'm like."
"19425900","19431000"," If they have a great ER and let's say they burned down into this ER is this close."
"19432140","19435940"," And they do have a like this looks like anticipation of a good earnings. "
"19436260","19437540"," The price where it is right now."
"19439920","19441400"," Like they're pricing this in."
"19441400","19443840"," This looks like dealers pricing in a good earnings. "
"19445760","19451160"," Trying to, trying to take some of that fucking instead of Tesla trade 350 fucking 400."
"19453140","19456480"," They're going to shave off 10 points, 20 points."
"19466620","19469260"," Let me see if I can see Tesla on this other chart back here. "
"19472460","19481630"," Yeah, Tesla is a hourly trigger."
"19483790","19486370"," It's right below it at 292 21."
"19487170","19488810"," So it is being pinned right below. "
"19488890","19490950"," It's hourly trigger right now this morning."
"19490950","19494870"," If you remember, I gave you the two places where I would like to buy Tesla."
"19494870","19498170"," That's at a 265 and 225. "
"19507510","19509570"," Yeah, I'm hoping we can get a squeeze up here."
"19518910","19519870"," I wouldn't be short."
"19519870","19522450"," Still have our two sitting to the upside here. "
"19529140","19530920"," We already tagged our one."
"19532540","19533860"," Two fifty seven."
"19534080","19535480"," That's going to print some nice money. "
"19537680","19540220"," Yeah, they're already bleeding off my calls here."
"19541260","19543160"," They're down to 22 cents right now."
"19543280","19545780"," So these dealers, they're just trying to cut through all this stuff. "
"19546540","19548620"," And we'll find out what they print into the bell."
"19548620","19551140"," So I'm just sitting here waiting for the bell at this point."
"19552040","19554880"," Let me see if I have anything in the background to talk about. "
"19556400","19558040"," I'm going to look at some tickers right now."
"19561590","19567630"," I was watching Schwab because they're coming into their hourly trigger right now."
"19568610","19572370"," And I'm also looking at Twilio TWLO. "
"19573350","19576970"," They're coming into their hourly right now at 66 79."
"19576970","19580630"," It's a good place to consider another long."
"19582210","19584150"," So Twilio squeezed earlier. "
"19584830","19587290"," And now Twilio is back to its hourly trigger."
"19588450","19589830"," So I'm going to take a peek at this one."
"19590550","19593030"," So Twilio is getting to the next buy point. "
"19593190","19595650"," We had a buy down below at 63 35."
"19596370","19597830"," It printed the top of the key."
"19598190","19599970"," I'm going to bring this over for you guys to see. "
"19604250","19606950"," Take a look at Twilio."
"19614500","19615340"," Twilio."
"19617180","19618840"," Okay, so Twilio. "
"19620340","19622100"," We had a buy on it."
"19623800","19625280"," Right down here."
"19627500","19629660"," It printed top of the key. "
"19630580","19631200"," Bam."
"19631600","19636320"," Nobody's business came right back down on its daily and weekly."
"19637300","19638540"," Right back up. "
"19638860","19638940"," Bam."
"19639420","19642200"," That's on its downside move right here."
"19643320","19646080"," I do want to bring your attention to where it's sitting. "
"19646440","19648260"," We have great full structure here."
"19649040","19651440"," So we're going to make this the next buy right here."
"19655900","19656520"," Twilio. "
"19657120","19659040"," I'm going to get rid of this one now."

"20708260","20710480"," This is like the tone setter for."
"20711860","20714460"," The entire tech earning season. "
"20714940","20717640"," So we want to see how this plays itself out."
"20717640","20720260"," We'll find out if we're going to trade sideways."
"20721160","20726380"," The point here though is if the earnings are good right even if they're going to sell off. "
"20726780","20728360"," You'll see spy recover tomorrow."
"20729180","20735360"," Even if Tesla sells off you'll see spy recover in anticipation of the rest of tech earnings."
"20735860","20736660"," So be aware of that. "
"20737440","20740700"," So if we start getting bearish of like Tesla Netflix bomb the earnings."
"20742100","20743460"," Then it's going to be bad."
"20743640","20745040"," We'll start that sell off early. "
"20745480","20748620"," So just keep that as a side note or a market note."
"20754080","20755420"," I'm trading up right now."
"20755800","20760480"," I've trained 31 cents on 4.56. I did add to my position when it was down at 21. "
"20761240","20763100"," So I'm pretty fucking green right now."
"20764660","20766400"," I don't know what else to say here."
"20766620","20772280"," I'm hoping that I can get a 15 minute between now and 4.15. I can get a nice big"
"20772280","20772640"," squeeze. "
"20773160","20776840"," Rip up to 4.58 and close them out and be done."
"20777860","20782060"," We could still see some more ramp selling after the bell."
"20782300","20783640"," So I want to tell you something else. "
"20784180","20789780"," So let's say we ramp up into this close here at 4 p.m. It would not shock me to"
"20789780","20792220"," see like a bloodbath again and then a whiplash."
"20792760","20796240"," So just be aware that there's there's some vol coming."
"20796700","20798960"," You'll see the same thing in the cues too. "
"20799720","20805500"," So if at any point you want to sell your calls here and then reposition at 4.01. That makes"
"20805500","20806320"," sense to me."
"20807000","20810300"," You can all we can always read by the shit down on the bell."
"20811060","20813500"," On these earning calls like this, right?"
"20813760","20815960"," It means nothing to like red bar down. "
"20817560","20818960"," Just before the release."
"20819900","20822000"," 4.05 comes and we go boom."
"20823900","20827940"," Measure where you're going to take profit at both levels on spy. "
"20828580","20829020"," Nowhere."
"20829080","20835360"," Know that it'll it'll miss the top R2 by a couple couple couple fucking pennies, man."
"20836980","20839080"," Trade 35 cents right now. "
"20839480","20841660"," None of you should be upside down."
"20845710","20847390"," If anything should be making money."
"20847650","20851990"," If I can get back to that 35 real quick, I'm going to pull the stuff off and go flat"
"20851990","20852970"," into the bell. "
"20862850","20866070"," So I got to sell order and I'm looking for one more penny if I can get it."
"20866070","20867890"," Two more pennies if I can get it."
"20877250","20880270"," So you'll have I'll have two charts up four times right now. "
"20880350","20880650"," Three eleven."
"20881190","20885070"," So you guys have heard me all day long just blab about earnings."
"20885870","20886430"," What to expect. "
"20886750","20888770"," You should have all that information at this point."
"20889690","20891850"," We will bring up two charts for you."
"20899080","20900180"," Or maybe three charts. "
"20900380","20901240"," We do three charts here."
"20901400","20901940"," We'll do three charts."
"20901940","20903500"," Four charts, maybe let's do four charts. "
"20906500","20908060"," We'll do four charts."
"20915590","20917570"," You're going to need to see this hourly trigger."
"20917790","20918150"," That's important. "
"20919550","20921090"," You're going to need to see our two."
"20921610","20922270"," That's by."
"20924930","20926830"," We're going to do the cues below it. "
"20936090","20937690"," It's like a it's like a mimic chart."

"21047540","21050520"," If you could run, I can't do that."
"21050580","21051460"," I suck at this man."
"21051720","21053280"," It's so fucking wonky. "
"21054060","21056860"," But if you could possibly run, let me text him and see if he can."
"21057280","21058440"," Maybe he can run two."
"21059160","21060540"," Maybe he can run two. "
"21062660","21071300"," Maybe he can run two polls and see if we get beats on Netflix and Netflix and"

"21271750","21273110"," Way down there. "
"21273250","21273570"," Look at that."
"21275410","21279690"," If they don't get their E.R. dude, they got a huge tag down here."
"21281290","21282670"," Damn, I like that trade. "
"21282670","21283550"," I like that."
"21291850","21295450"," 5.22. Netflix is up."
"21295690","21296970"," Netflix is like a..."
"21298730","21301890"," Dude, we might get some good action after this bell here. "
"21302050","21304190"," We might get some solid action here."
"21305730","21308990"," We might get some solid action in queues."
"21310930","21313750"," 4.5. There's a monster move there. "
"21315010","21315870"," Monster move."
"21316750","21322170"," I mean, look at that."
"21322310","21323670"," If they don't hit..."
"21324790","21327130"," Man, they're also going to get..."
"21327130","21333550"," If you're going to trade this in 500 right there, doesn't really cut loose queues after the bell"
"21333550","21333970"," spy. "
"21334910","21343970"," Like, right below 500, like 4.98. You cut your 4 to 4.15 in the afternoon calls on that."
"21345150","21347930"," 4.56 is trading 38 cents right now."
"21348510","21350270"," 38 cents right now. "
"21351030","21352030"," 4.56 is..."
"21354510","21358490"," Big moves expected in these E.R.s. Fuck, yeah, I love it."

"21362650","21364050"," So we got queues, right?"
"21394760","21398720"," 3.88. Bam, they hit their first target in the day. "
"21399920","21401060"," And then we've got..."
"21401060","21403540"," We've got the big bad boy up here for the upside move."
"21405740","21407940"," 3.91, man, 42."
"21412910","21414690"," Big bad boy right there. "
"21414870","21415930"," Look at that monster move."
"21419580","21421840"," Look at that monster move right there."
"21422740","21426700"," I know if you're a bull, you're just salivating for this move right here. "
"21427660","21430140"," So, like, take that fucking monster trade."
"21432000","21434080"," Take that face ripper right there."
"21435520","21436520"," Did you see it?"
"21436680","21437460"," Just, like, boom. "
"21438760","21439620"," Rocket ship."
"21444220","21444960"," Downside expectations."
"21450710","21452390"," Haven't seen this yet, have you?"
"21454130","21455650"," Haven't even seen that today. "
"21457810","21459590"," 3.84 is the pivot on this one."
"21463470","21464650"," Was it 3.84?"
"21465530","21469250"," 3.84.29. 3.84.29. Almost a perfect pin strike."
"21469730","21472110"," Dude, you guys, you guys get levels for me. "
"21472290","21475370"," This was almost a perfect pin strike on the queues today."
"21476270","21476930"," Look at that shit."
"21477590","21478810"," Bam, almost a perfect pin strike. "
"21481090","21482230"," That's the pivot point."
"21482650","21484110"," This is a pivot for a queues today."
"21486350","21487410"," Netflix pumping right now. "
"21488910","21493850"," 43 cents on 4.56C. Just cranking up into this bell."
"21494090","21495490"," 3.22 in the afternoon."
"21496510","21498370"," Expect a pullback on R2. "
"21498730","21504010"," You also have a target on the high of 3.57. There's going to be a pullback here."
"21504210","21509830"," So, if you want to take some money off the table on R1, or just slightly above it, don't hesitate"
"21509830","21510690"," to do it."
"21518190","21524790"," Yeah, I want you to think about, um, I want you to think about the fact that you, if you"
"21524790","21527190"," close your calls, I don't know what to say to you. "
"21527790","21530230"," I snapped that line at 2.30, right?"
"21531030","21533050"," That line at 2.30 was what time?"
"21533250","21533850"," Where's 2.30?"
"21534290","21535210"," You ready for it?"
"21535270","21536810"," I had this on the chart for you earlier."
"21537330","21537430"," Ready?"
"21539330","21540030"," Right there."
"21541110","21541510"," See it?"
"21542950","21544630"," Remember, this line was on the chart. "
"21544970","21547270"," There's 2.30. What has it done since 2.30?"
"21548070","21548830"," Just plow higher."
"21549190","21551570"," Told you about how they might sell into 2.30. You got it."
"21551570","21560870"," It's sold into 2.30. Now, buy.exe. Take the hedge off. "
"21562830","21565010"," It should break above R1."
"21565730","21566770"," Take some off the table."
"21567150","21567710"," Take your winnings. "
"21568570","21572510"," Look to re-enter above R1 on a consolidation for a move to R2."
"21573570","21574750"," I'm flat right now."
"21575310","21577530"," I'm hoping I get a red bar after the bell here. "

"21596830","21598270"," He's probably at his doctor's appointment. "
"21598930","21599510"," How about this then?"
"21599590","21603290"," If Winky's not here, how about you guys just tell me in the chat?"
"21606290","21607650"," Tell me inside the chat."
"21608690","21609710"," Do you think?"
"21610410","21611470"," Give me two answers."
"21612390","21614110"," NFLX beat or miss?"
"21615390","21616650"," Tesla beat or miss?"
"21616950","21617950"," We'll just do either report. "
"21618450","21619010"," We'll get the guidance."
"21636910","21640570"," Netflix teed off right on its hourly trigger."
"21641010","21642690"," Someone asked me in the chat earlier. "
"21642690","21645750"," Why do you think it's bullish on Netflix?"
"21646130","21646870"," I remember that question."
"21647110","21650370"," They asked the question, is Netflix bearish here or something?"
"21651030","21656930"," And I said, no, they confirmed their hourly trigger and sure enough, their hourly trigger on"
"21656930","21658130"," Netflix was right here."
"21659210","21660770"," So, nope, it was bullish. "
"21661690","21667090"," That's because there's another part of the tool that you likely don't have that I do."
"21668490","21671250"," Which gives it the edge that the trigger does not."
"21672310","21679670"," So, Tesla or Netflix coming back to retest previous highs currently right now, parked right at its"
"21679670","21680310"," opening price. "
"21682070","21694220"," Let me see"
"21696880","21697620"," what you guys are saying."
"21697780","21698820"," I'm going to read some of the chat here."
"21699100","21702200"," Netflix beat, Tesla beat, Netflix beat, beat, beat, beat, anybody. "
"21703060","21703520"," Tesla flat."
"21703760","21704160"," I like that."
"21705460","21706840"," Who's got Netflix miss?"
"21707200","21709500"," I doubt the Netflix miss, but okay. "
"21711020","21715400"," I think they missed their guidance, but not their."
"21718520","21719740"," Oh, very strong guidance."
"21720000","21720980"," You guys are opposite of me. "
"21721360","21723540"," I think they, I think that they are making bank."
"21724680","21730000"," And I think that their guidance is going to, they're going to try to soften the blow of the rider's"
"21730000","21730220"," strike."
"21738390","21740110"," BLK is moving right on, right on, Andrea. "
"21749940","21753460"," Yeah, I like the new factory openings in Europe right now, David."
"21755780","21759400"," I like the, I like the, I like the, I like the mandates for Tesla."
"21760360","21762620"," I think that's positive for Tesla in Europe. "
"21763960","21766600"," If the US were to do that, be game over, right?"
"21767560","21769340"," Tesla'd be like a thousand bucks in like a week."

"22311430","22313650"," And I sold those for like bank. "
"22314770","22319150"," They're like a 3% ripper on those things and I was out to money and run."
"22320870","22321750"," Like ran."

"22346560","22347660"," Hit and run, baby."
"22350110","22351610"," Yeah, I'm not on that trade."
"22351850","22353030"," The Tesla energy revs. "
"22353970","22354510"," In margins."
"22354930","22355790"," I'm not on that trade."
"22355950","22357230"," I don't think that's the dark horse. "
"22357490","22361010"," I think from my experience, you need something that's not even expected."
"22362990","22366210"," In the fact that you know about, well, not you, but I know this conversation."
"22367450","22368690"," I need something delivered. "
"22369230","22369770"," I need a split."
"22370070","22371290"," I need something for me personally."
"22372870","22375650"," At this point, investors' day is not enough. "
"22375970","22377270"," Those promises are not enough."
"22380930","22382990"," Do I think Tesla will sell off after ER."
"22383410","22384590"," So I went over this this morning. "
"22386350","22390430"," I think the dealers, unless you get something that's unknown to the market, the dealers are going"
"22390430","22395230"," to hit the bottom and top or fail the bottom and top expected move on the options."
"22395270","22396050"," The market is priced."
"22396930","22399850"," You'll get the real move in Tesla after the 21st. "
"22402050","22407830"," Yeah, dude, like TGT, most bullish ticker I'm looking at right now."
"22408090","22409290"," Most bullish ticker period."
"22409670","22409930"," Absolutely. "
"22411530","22416350"," I like Tesla call spreads along with put spreads, believe it or not."
"22417250","22418910"," You can see if you can hit both sides of that."
"22419750","22423170"," I like it because it doesn't, if the vol blows off the market, it means nothing. "
"22428190","22432110"," I'm trying to grab some, I'm trying to synthetically trade this."
"22434390","22440010"," So what I'm trying to do here is what I really want to do is I want to, so let's"
"22440010","22441030"," look at, let's do this right now."
"22441250","22444010"," So Netflix is being teed up, right?"
"22444370","22445770"," Tesla is being teed up. "
"22446750","22448050"," So there's an example."
"22448430","22452930"," So we already know that Tesla, let's say they beat, right?"
"22453950","22455410"," Let's just assume Tesla beats."
"22458410","22460270"," So let's do a white one. "
"22461170","22462490"," So let's say Tesla beats."
"22463430","22467550"," I'm going to assume a red bar down, like right at four o'clock."
"22468070","22469170"," And let's say they beat. "
"22469670","22474950"," I'm going to expect a green bar up into 4.15. And then you're going to see a pullback."
"22476030","22479330"," And they're going to await guidance, right?"
"22480750","22482130"," Well, meanwhile, I can trade."
"22482950","22488670"," Hopefully I can grab a red bar down, calls, and then run this up. "
"22490250","22493670"," At four oh five, right?"
"22494910","22497170"," I'll take my money and I'm out."
"22500950","22507410"," Meanwhile, you're now, you're now renegotiating your bet on Tesla on good guidance."
"22508250","22510790"," And if they fail their guidance, they're going down. "
"22511670","22518810"," If they, if they meet their guidance, but no, nothing unexpected, they might go up here, but sell"
"22518810","22524170"," off into the open tomorrow and then hit a downside target."
"22524170","22525730"," Dealers say, thank you for playing."
"22526210","22527490"," Meanwhile, I win. "
"22527910","22528490"," Does that make sense?"
"22529450","22530770"," So that's the synthetic trade."
"22531250","22532310"," They don't always work."
"22533070","22537890"," But what it does is it gives me that extra 15 minutes to like capture everything. "
"22538950","22540930"," How many times have you guys made a trade?"
"22541910","22542310"," Up or down?"
"22542470","22542810"," I don't care."
"22543750","22544490"," Sell it off."
"22544670","22548210"," Or like a new report goes up or goes down. "
"22548770","22551010"," And then you're like, fuck yeah, my puts are going to print."
"22551850","22554750"," You wake up the next morning and it's right back up the flat."
"22556010","22557370"," Oh, that's pretty bad, right?"
"22557650","22560010"," Not always in the put side, but in the call side, it happens a lot. "
"22560490","22562450"," Like you see this big fucking face ripper?"
"22562810","22566230"," You come back the next day and they're just like, fuck you, you're not getting paid."
"22570490","22571310"," You want tacos?"
"22572030","22579210"," If you're going to do a call or put spread, I always recommend at least the next strike, not the"
"22579210","22580130"," most current strike."
"22585400","22588260"," Can I talk a little bit more about why I'm so bullish on Tesla?"
"22588600","22589180"," Yeah, I can do that. "
"22595080","22595680"," I can do that."
"22596300","22603220"," Let's switch up the music here and why it's not sponsored by to the tick."
"22604260","22605660"," Why am I so bullish?"
"22612220","22613720"," Let's talk by my bullish. "
"22617480","22618180"," Good question."
"22621060","22623360"," There's a rotation going on right now."
"22623480","22624600"," You might not know it. "
"22632790","22634290"," Let me turn this off here."
"22636830","22638450"," So you might not know it."
"22638510","22643470"," You might not see it, but there is a rotation going on in the market. "
"22643590","22644510"," There's not a distribution."
"22645150","22649130"," There's a rotation going on in the market."
"22650330","22652470"," So quietly in the background. "
"22654030","22656550"," So you guys know, you guys know what's happening, right?"
"22656910","22662410"," So the market's going up right now and we're trying or the Fed is trying to institute a soft"
"22662410","22662870"," landing."
"22664090","22667910"," Way back in December 2020, December of 2020."
"22669230","22674770"," We started to cut the legs off of sectors, sub sectors, small sectors. "
"22675650","22677150"," Spectoroth was the first to go."
"22677530","22686010"," And over time, the Fed has been trying to try to buy time to lessen the downside impact to the"
"22686010","22687410"," market at large."
"22688290","22690890"," They're trying to orchestrate a soft landing. "
"22691890","22692970"," Mike Burry made a great post."
"22693310","22694630"," He said, congratulations."
"22695190","22695890"," You bought the dip. "
"22696550","22698050"," So we didn't get the second leg down."
"22698410","22700990"," What also happened was they continued."
"22701930","22703980"," Banks continued to in an orderly fashion. "
"22703980","22708100"," Go sector by sector and cut the fat, cut the waste."
"22708620","22713440"," Reprise companies that have made it through this secondary cycle, COVID cycle."
"22714780","22715820"," And quietly. "
"22717820","22721340"," There have been stocks being reprised all along the way."
"22721780","22725720"," Well, we're all looking at spy and cues and then VDA."
"22727980","22730980"," And then they're buying the bottoms of these tickers. "
"22732320","22736040"," The last cycle, the most recent one was regional banks."
"22737080","22744000"," And most recently, you see some fundamental components of our market getting whacked."
"22744780","22747480"," You saw it with Tyson Foods. "
"22747740","22748700"," You saw it with Budweiser."
"22749200","22750340"," Saw it with Verizon."
"22751560","22753460"," Target is another one. "
"22756020","22763240"," And so quietly, they're buying and accumulating these tickers."
"22763780","22765800"," So right here, I'm going to show you one."
"22768280","22769220"," That's been happening. "
"22769520","22770500"," So you want to always be."
"22770700","22773460"," I'm the kind of guy that's like always before and never after."
"22774320","22774800"," Okay. "
"22775280","22778720"," So I'm always looking for always before and never after."
"22778900","22780840"," I could care less once it's squeezing."
"22781780","22785520"," I care once it once it I care about the entry before. "
"22786180","22788840"," It's never it's never glamorous to do that, right?"
"22790240","22793400"," It's never glamorous to be looking for the shit stocks."
"22794840","22798740"," I don't know if I'm saying being nice on this, but I want to show you guys some here."
"22801230","22803850"," I want to I want to direct your attention to target. "
"22804510","22808550"," I want you to see this big low and velocity."
"22808550","22812470"," I want to show you the turnaround that's happening."
"22812630","22818210"," I want to show you that the giant moved down here in the turn taking place. "
"22818750","22823650"," I want to show you that the lows here and then the higher lows and this kind of dissolved to"
"22823650","22824890"," this TGT target."
"22827890","22829590"," I want to show you what's happening here."
"22829690","22830890"," I'm going to delete all this here. "
"22832750","22832930"," Okay."
"22833010","22833850"," Just so you can see it."
"22833850","22841870"," And I want you to see velocity moving neutral and wanting to go positive. "
"22842390","22844130"," And what happens when that happens?"
"22844430","22845490"," We get giant moves."
"22845710","22846710"," You see this move right here?"
"22847290","22850930"," The upside, right?"
"22851230","22851730"," See it right there?"
"22851870","22853110"," Watch my cursor bottom of the screen."
"22854070","22858970"," I want you to see the monster monster monster bottoming here. "
"22858970","22863550"," And we have an attraction to the weekly trigger."
"22863570","22864470"," That's right here."
"22864870","22866050"," 147-18. "
"22866490","22867610"," We have an attraction to it."
"22867690","22868310"," It's like a magnet."
"22869470","22871430"," And we also have monthly. "
"22871990","22876850"," This is so TGT is still negative, but we have 168-80 as a target."
"22877830","22881870"," TGT isn't even getting positive until it gets above this."
"22882050","22882970"," We have higher targets. "
"22883810","22885910"," Right now it's trading 132-75."
"22887230","22889670"," So do I think it's going to go up here?"
"22889830","22890830"," Yeah, I do."
"22891670","22893070"," I got a target of 147. "
"22894090","22898930"," I got another target over here of 160 by the time it gets there."
"22899510","22901510"," Trading 132 right now."
"22904170","22905150"," Trading 132. "
"22906190","22909950"," Another key point here is I already know that this can break."
"22910550","22912190"," I already know this can break."
"22913110","22920010"," So I'm looking for a trade here on Taraje to break above, consolidate. "
"22921410","22921430"," Right?"
"22922310","22924670"," And then make this giant fucking move right there."
"22925050","22926930"," Watch that green line right there."
"22928130","22931050"," And just start fucking ripping to the upside. "
"22932450","22934270"," There's your August right there."
"22934950","22935670"," This is the rotation."
"22937250","22937810"," Right?"
"22938410","22940090"," Slams up there, comes back down. "
"22940090","22942650"," The daily then comes into play."
"22943510","22946630"," Right down here, 137-136 comes back up."
"22947550","22947590"," Right?"
"22947990","22953690"," So there's your green line, comes back down, and you start to fight for your next level to the"
"22953690","22953810"," upside. "
"22954210","22958390"," So if you're looking for a play that's like three months out, six months out, target."
"22959670","22960010"," Taraje."
"22961390","22964350"," I got a target here of 158-78. "
"22965090","22966750"," You got a ton of vol in here."
"22967310","22969090"," So this is going to be tough above."
"22970650","22973550"," So 160 target here by the time we get there. "
"22974070","22978850"," You're going to see a ton of volatility and trap buyers here to get even higher."
"22979150","22983590"," So just generally now my outlook on target is very bullish, extremely bullish on target."
"22984350","22985790"," Extreme bullishness on it. "
"22986770","22988010"," No brainer trade."
"22988830","22989370"," No brainer."
"22990270","22996510"," Stops below 125, but sorry, like this thing is going to fucking explode. "
"22996890","22997350"," TGT."
"22998950","23003330"," Those other tickers, those other tickers I mentioned are the same way."
"23003690","23007550"," We're a little early right now on ATT. "
"23007810","23008410"," It could go lower."
"23009130","23011610"," I'm just expecting a half back trade right now on TGT."
"23012610","23015150"," I'm not TGT on ATT. "
"23015850","23019590"," A little early on that one, but TGT is primed."
"23020430","23021730"," Just think about this."
"23021930","23024410"," I want to talk to you guys about something here on target real quick. "
"23026050","23027550"," I want you to know something here."
"23027610","23029490"," I want to show you something here."
"23032090","23036230"," You don't want to be this guy and you don't want to be this guy. "
"23037050","23038270"," Guess who you want to be?"
"23039190","23040570"," That fucking guy right there."
"23041990","23044910"," You want all these assholes to propel you up."
"23045790","23047770"," You want people to get bullish here. "
"23047970","23051450"," So once it gets sold down, you're going to sell into somebody up here."
"23051870","23055130"," Then you're going to rebuy back in here because these are going to be panic sellers."
"23056390","23056510"," Right?"
"23056830","23060990"," And you're going to blast off above here and they're going to try to buy the next top up there. "
"23061690","23062490"," Makes sense?"
"23064970","23066810"," So I know it's not being taught."
"23066810","23072130"," I know it's not glamorous to talk about TGT right now, but I don't know."
"23072150","23073550"," You got to put risk on in this market. "
"23074590","23076910"," That's like a fucking prime setup right there."
"23078070","23079270"," Prime setup."
"23084700","23085900"," Prime setup. "
"23089200","23091140"," 12 minutes left into the bell."
"23091480","23092680"," You know my plan here."
"23093500","23097940"," I'm looking to get some cheap calls at four o'clock. "
"23097940","23099620"," It's not 401 somewhere in there."
"23101200","23104080"," This helps me to get those cheap calls hopefully."
"23105420","23107200"," You're walking the plank on Tesla. "
"23107620","23111900"," You'll likely walk the plank on the hourly trigger on Netflix as well."
"23112980","23114420"," See how it's parked right on it?"
"23114660","23115540"," Parked right on it?"
"23123690","23124850"," Yeah, I'll be honest."
"23124910","23126470"," I'm going to say something to you guys out there. "
"23126550","23128210"," I'm going to say something to all of you guys out there."
"23128310","23131270"," Nobody gives a fuck if TGT is busy or not."
"23131750","23133770"," Market makers do not care. "
"23133770","23134910"," They make a market."
"23135290","23136230"," That's what they do."
"23136770","23140410"," As soon as you learn that, right, you're going to become a way better trader. "
"23141230","23142650"," Yeah, even if you're a bear."
"23143310","23145990"," If you're a bear bull, I don't care if you're a buyer or seller."
"23146810","23150910"," Unless they're committing fraud, they're going to make a market for all these tickers. "
"23151530","23152690"," I assure you of that."
"23153170","23155390"," It's a fundamental part of our market."
"23155830","23160990"," They will sell fucking burning tires after an apocalypse that are worthless. "
"23162030","23164190"," This has nothing to do with fundamentals."
"23164690","23170550"," This has everything to do with making a market for a ticker and they will do it."
"23171230","23178110"," And this is when you think that something is irrational is because you don't know or think or"
"23178110","23183370"," understand that these market makers out there, they will accumulate at a certain price. "
"23184230","23189450"," They will run it up on your ass and then they will sell into you on the best news."
"23189450","23192050"," So when you're like, why does the news not match this stuff?"
"23192450","23195870"," There's a whole not a side of the market where they don't give a fine fuck about what you think."
"23196430","23201750"," You can just take your fundamentals, rip them up, put on a pile, pour gasoline on them and light"
"23201750","23202530"," that shit on fire. "
"23203330","23205450"," You'll become a better trader, buyer or seller."
"23206830","23207950"," I love fundamentals."
"23208670","23208910"," I do. "
"23209150","23209590"," I love them."
"23209870","23212490"," I use them as like a tenth tier reason."
"23213810","23218690"," As long as a company's not committing fraud or a company's not, you know, squandering shit or"
"23218690","23220290"," they're not showing new growth. "
"23220670","23223390"," So following the close today and around 4%."
"23223390","23224610"," It's like serious."
"23224950","23229690"," It's like supporting their second quarter earning as the next is the first company in the state. "
"23229770","23230370"," It's telling you."
"23230590","23231990"," Take the sector."
"23232750","23234570"," I've gotten burned too many times. "
"23235130","23236930"," You're like, that shit's going to hell."
"23237130","23243150"," I think it's $2.85 and with an estimated revenue of $8.3 billion as well."
"23243470","23245030"," I'm going to talk about fundamentals really quick. "
"23248350","23249810"," You get reports from Tesla."
"23250270","23252970"," They're reporting their second quarter, 2023 earnings as well."
"23253490","23258890"," Estimated GPS of 80 cents for those with an estimated revenue of $24.5 billion. "
"23259970","23261810"," And also decide to make our users aware."
"23262330","23266130"," Our very own Tony is currently going through a live stream prep of these earnings reports."
"23266910","23269850"," The live video is just slightly down the news for you to anyone that's interested. "
"23272050","23274030"," So I'm going to talk to you guys about fundamentals really quick."
"23274130","23275330"," It's a very important point here to make."
"23276310","23278210"," So a lot of these growth stocks that I pick. "
"23279770","23280590"," Not a lot of them."
"23280770","23282830"," All of them have great year of year sales."
"23283910","23287130"," They beat their expectations, their guidance, all that crap, right?"
"23287550","23288410"," They all got repriced. "
"23289750","23290630"," That they're all great companies."
"23291090","23299350"," If you look at any of these companies up there, talk to you about everything."
"23299350","23301790"," Get a free trial. "
"23302050","23302390"," They're bad."
"23302610","23303370"," Don't come."
"23305270","23307090"," And so they're bad ass. "
"23307310","23308490"," These are bad ass companies."
"23308930","23310210"," They still got repriced."
"23311730","23314650"," They all have been repriced in their COVID highs. "
"23315270","23316250"," I look for that."
"23319190","23322150"," But I'm also looking for two other things."
"23322610","23323570"," Are they committing fraud?"
"23324930","23327330"," So like a like a Nikola, right?"
"23327330","23331070"," The other thing that I'm looking for is like a peloton. "
"23331410","23334770"," Those are my two favorite examples for recent memory."
"23335510","23336170"," Nikola committing fraud."
"23336710","23337690"," What did peloton do?"
"23338450","23341810"," Did they, did they, did they go out there and start creating a bicycle?"
"23342670","23348410"," So when we reopened, did they create a bicycle so that you would transition from bicycling in your"
"23348410","23350650"," home office to outside?"
"23351170","23351290"," No. "
"23352270","23354530"," They did a wristwatch or some shit, right?"
"23355290","23356930"," Are they looking towards the future?"
"23357490","23357990"," In my view?"
"23358490","23358570"," No."
"23359670","23364750"," But then some of these, not some, all these companies that I talked to you about, if you go into"
"23364750","23366330"," their fundamentals, they're like, fuck no."
"23367610","23368410"," We're making bank. "
"23369050","23370050"," We're making real products."
"23370670","23370990"," We're expanding."
"23372610","23373710"," Even in a tightening cycle. "
"23376270","23382910"," So I like fundamentals to an extent for certain things, but they will sell burning tires in New"
"23382910","23386970"," York City after an apocalypse, I assure you, these fucking market makers don't care."
"23387890","23393330"," If the last company left was committing fraud, they would fucking sell stock on that shit too if"
"23393330","23393890"," they had to."
"23394930","23401390"," So learn that as a, the fundamentals are great, but also learn that there's a market to be made. "
"23408970","23410010"," Yes, they did."
"23414250","23417250"," We got Netflix coming into the clothes right now bouncing around."
"23417530","23420450"," I'm going to take this to a one minute chart so you can see it more clearly. "
"23422130","23424690"," I'm going to take the cues to a one minute chart."
"23424990","23426850"," I'm going to take spy to a one minute chart."
"23432950","23434310"," Getting pretty close here. "
"23437470","23441890"," Feel free inside the chat to talk about if you're bullish or bearish on this clothes."
"23444570","23446670"," Take Tesla to a one minute chart."
"23447550","23450990"," I've already given you my synopsis on what to expect on all these companies. "
"23452190","23454230"," I think some of you already discussed it as well."
"23455830","23457050"," Let us know in the chat."
"23457190","23462410"," If you feel like you're, let us know in the chat what your positioning is. "
"23462970","23464150"," Are you sitting on your hands?"
"23464450","23465870"," Are you waiting for this stuff to pass?"
"23467490","23468990"," Spy bleeding off right now."
"23469330","23471570"," Are you waiting to buy calls or puts after the bell?"
"23471890","23472890"," Are you trading it synthetically?"
"23473250","23474290"," Are you in spreads?"
"23476530","23477170"," It's a good time."
"23477310","23478970"," You guys are amongst a bunch of retailers. "
"23479470","23480270"," It's okay to be wrong."
"23480450","23481830"," I'm wrong on stream all the time."
"23483170","23484230"," Don't feel bad. "
"23484450","23485570"," Get up to your pick up now."
"23485830","23491350"," Do you get Netflix reporting Q2, 2023 earnings with an estimated EPS of two dollars and 85 cents,"
"23491690","23494450"," then estimated revenue of eight spot three billion dollars."
"23494810","23499390"," Also in 10 minutes time now to get Tesla reporting Q2, 2023 earnings. "
"23500170","23505970"," So that estimated EPS seen at 80 cents over the estimated revenue of 24 spot five billion dollars."
"23507910","23509250"," So I'm watching this."
"23509490","23512110"," I'm watching this options chain right now on spy. "
"23512470","23512710"," Okay."
"23514070","23517510"," And there are 600."
"23519550","23523570"," So implied vol just the daily calls right ones from today. "
"23523890","23530470"," There are now 633,000 calls on 456 C."
"23531410","23534590"," Earlier in the morning, I talked to you about how they might bleed those off."
"23534590","23538550"," If they have to print them, they want them very fucking cheap, right?"
"23540330","23542870"," 455 C's are trading 55 cents."
"23543210","23545070"," They were banging earlier today. "
"23545870","23549950"," So dealers of command, they're doing their vacuum and operate the cleaning up the house here."
"23550430","23551350"," Thank you for playing."
"23551950","23554730"," I wonder if they've caught on at this point, what we're doing. "
"23559250","23561430"," I wonder if they've caught on here."
"23563230","23566150"," I'm going to be looking at 455 right now."
"23567470","23567950"," 455. "
