"5900","7220"," All right, this is gonna be difficult."
"7380","8580"," This is not gonna be easy."
"18400","20060"," All right, let's see what's going on here. "
"75980","77120"," All right, let's get right into it here."
"77120","78080"," We're gonna get going."
"95390","97550"," Yeah, definitely not failing you yet. "
"103110","108670"," Hey, what's going on everybody?"
"108670","109890"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"110610","112530"," I'm gonna get right into it here."
"114830","120410"," Okay, so this is a 30 minute chart."
"121450","123430"," Good morning to all of you out there. "
"125370","126370"," How's everybody doing?"
"126670","129930"," We're gonna start with what's going on here."
"134070","139790"," First of all, I've got COVID and I got to state that."
"140550","145150"," I've never had COVID first time for having COVID. "
"147030","148810"," We'll talk about it briefly, I guess."
"155990","164290"," I've well, early Monday morning, wife got sick, then the kids got sick, then I confirmed that it"
"164290","164790"," was COVID."
"164990","165290"," I'll take it. "
"165550","169150"," I'll have to take another test too to see if I'm still testing positive."
"171110","174430"," I haven't lost my sense of taste or smell yet."
"175710","178610"," I am vaccinated and boosted. "
"179650","181370"," Even the newest booster I have."
"181990","186050"," I do mask up, though I haven't been masking as much as they used to in crowd spaces."
"187210","189830"," And I got fucking sick now. "
"191050","197210"," I've never had it before, so I don't understand what it's about, but it's not as nice as I or"
"197210","197470"," it's not."
"197890","199270"," It's definitely its own thing."
"199450","199890"," I'll say that. "
"200030","203870"," I don't think I've ever had quite this kind of sick."
"205390","212230"," And I'm violently ill, like, or not valley, like no will to do anything, hide underneath covers."
"213150","216730"," And then I have a keep thinking I'm gonna come back from it, and then I don't. "
"219170","219930"," So I don't know."
"220050","226330"," It's been a I know for sure have been sick since sort of feeling sick on Sunday, but it wasn't"
"226330","226670"," sure."
"226850","229710"," And then Monday for sure, into right now. "
"229850","231510"," I'm having a hard time doing the stream right now."
"232210","233270"," I'll be honest with you."
"234510","237370"," I'm not like I said, I said I thought you got the bottom eyes. "
"237710","243810"," I don't feel like that, but I do feel cloudy and I don't feel like I'm up to 100%."
"243810","253390"," So my biggest fear here is that I don't want to get long COVID and I'm hoping that that vaccine"
"253390","262790"," that I took is going to like blunt whatever my body is fighting it or it blunts like whatever"
"262790","265670"," damage can be done permanently or semi permanently, whatever."
"266370","269550"," And of course, it's affected the entire house and our houses. "
"269830","273950"," I was like, I think I said, every man for himself, it's been like that, like everybody's wrapped up"
"273950","277270"," in like blankets curled up in fetal positions."
"280110","287570"," We're taking tons of rubitas and we already take vitamins, vitamin D, vitamin E, I take fish oil"
"287570","287930"," already."
"288070","290550"," So we already do all that stuff as it is. "
"290710","291850"," I haven't been to the doctor."
"292230","296770"," I don't know if I should like I'm gonna of course tell my primary care position, but we haven't"
"296770","302210"," been to the doctor and we haven't had any blue lips or blue tips or anything none of that stuff."
"303010","303790"," And it's really weird. "
"304330","307670"," I like have moments where I feel like, yeah, I can go outside and run marathon."
"308750","315090"," And as a matter of fact, Sunday, no Saturday, I rode bikes all day long, like I rose ride out"
"315090","315930"," riding all day long."
"315930","319170"," I think that was Saturday, it was Saturday or Sunday, I can't remember. "
"320130","324550"," And then I was like active up until I got sick."
"325950","328150"," And I think my my oldest daughter got it."
"328330","329910"," I think my oldest got it first. "
"331070","336690"," And then she proceeded to give it to myself and my wife and my youngest daughter still hasn't"
"336690","338930"," tested positive and still is not sick."
"339070","340290"," The youngest is not sick."
"341110","342690"," Now they have us quarantining her. "
"343290","345410"," So she's doing the quarantine thing with us."
"346230","348790"," But it's been like cancel this cancel that tell everybody."
"350290","352270"," And you know, I was worried when I got it. "
"352510","356930"," I there's some reason I felt a sense of relief."
"358850","364070"," So there was some relief in finding out that I had COVID."
"364150","367990"," I don't know why what I did what I was supposed to do. "
"368490","372150"," You know, like the federal government said what they said, mask up, they said don't overload the"
"372150","372870"," hospital system."
"372870","374750"," So I feel like I did everything I was supposed to do right."
"375250","379290"," And we're going to stop this shit, but at least slow it down so that it's not all of us"
"379290","380270"," in the hospital at the same time. "
"380690","381730"," So I did my fucking job."
"382690","383230"," I waited."
"384890","385950"," And now I got it. "
"387230","391830"," And I don't seem to need the hospital right now or anything."
"392690","395730"," I don't know if I should still go maybe or tell them I haven't told them yet."
"396330","400770"," Either I'll take another test right now I'll see if I'm still tested positive or not. "
"401050","403470"," But I've never felt this before either."
"403710","405450"," I've never had a sickness like this."
"406330","411750"," I don't know what it would be like if I wasn't vaccinated or boosted or not. "
"412150","419210"," I don't know if this is helping like whatever exposure I have to this this variant of the virus"
"419210","422150"," versus whatever I've been shot up with at this point."
"423510","426410"," I had a little bit of a panic attack last night."
"426650","427070"," I went to sleep. "
"428450","429710"," I feel like I couldn't breathe."
"430290","435110"," But it was because I had a fan blowing on me and I was dehydrated."
"435270","437050"," So I pounded a bunch of water in the middle of the night. "
"438270","439490"," And then I felt fine."
"439990","443710"," But I think it was more because I wasn't I hadn't keeping up on fluids and stuff."
"445050","447190"," What else is I don't know what else is worried about it. "
"447310","450390"," I have like a severe temper like I get severe temperature that goes away."
"450450","451590"," It's a very temperature that goes away."
"452390","456250"," I take Robotussin do all the normal shit that you do. "
"457130","458930"," I still am able to eat for some reason."
"458930","461270"," But then I get bouts of nausea."
"462250","463510"," I have nausea right now. "
"465910","470170"," So it's really bizarre sickness."
"470810","471970"," It's really fucking weird."
"473870","474970"," Like I can still eat. "
"475330","475910"," But then I get nausea."
"476170","477950"," So I'm like, okay, I won't eat in like two hours later."
"478150","479270"," I'm like, okay, I can put some food in. "
"480090","482930"," And I'm not experiencing anything else."
"483130","484490"," I've lost my voice here and there."
"485290","487070"," That's probably sounding scratchy right now. "
"487090","488650"," But I've been pounding water."
"488870","494450"," Took a shower and shit and all that kind of stuff to be on this morning."
"494650","496170"," Now we got to we have a lot to talk about here. "
"497190","498330"," We're going to get into that right now."
"498370","500210"," We're going to stop the lab and all that kind of stuff."
"500470","504550"," So we got to we have a bunch to talk about. "
"505750","508910"," And I got to try to get through it because I don't know if I can stream tomorrow."
"509010","511150"," I doubt I can be here till 4 p.m. today."
"511230","516429"," If I can get on tomorrow in the morning, I will update at like crucial points. "
"517409","521870"," So we'll be here at those moments like if we're turning up, we're turning down if we're rolling"
"521870","522630"," that kind of stuff."
"523590","526330"," Otherwise, I think I'm out for the rest of the week."
"526490","527090"," It's that bad. "
"528730","530970"," And of course, I don't want to catch long COVID."
"531150","534390"," Like that's the one thing I was talking to Joe Donut about earlier this week."
"535130","537610"," And I don't want to catch long COVID. "
"537690","542210"," I don't want to be fucked up for like three months or a month or six months or a year"
"542210","543050"," and that kind of stuff."
"543570","545350"," Okay, so moving on from that COVID shit."
"547050","548170"," We have to talk, right?"
"548310","552390"," We talked on last time we had a show was Friday and asked who was bearish?"
"553070","555490"," Who was bullish on that close?"
"555950","558730"," And I got a lot of the chat was looking pretty ugly. "
"559550","560890"," It was looking so ugly."
"561410","565990"," And the mantra on the drum beat was so bearish that I even asked at the end of the show."
"567570","570690"," Towards the end of the show, I asked you guys, it was that one in the afternoon, one in the"
"570690","574730"," afternoon, and the people were saying the monthly trigger wasn't holding. "
"575610","576870"," Everyone was bearish."
"577590","579930"," And then I started to ask people what their positioning was."
"580190","582090"," Are you actually in a short right now?"
"582490","582990"," Are you not?"
"583790","588730"," And what I got back though for most people was I'm extremely bearish, but I'm not in a short"
"588730","589210"," position. "
"589670","593990"," Some were still short or in long put positions, stuff like that."
"594150","600450"," But for all that noise in the chat, once people are asked, are you short?"
"601270","601850"," They weren't."
"601970","607790"," And that's good to have seen last Friday because you saw what happened into Monday and then into"
"607790","610230"," the rest of this week into what Jay Pao did. "
"610650","612210"," And we'll talk about Jay Pao tomorrow."
"613610","621830"," I do want to talk about him raining in the bullshit from the last time what he said."
"622070","628610"," But I'm also concerned with what I brought up to you last week, which was I've been harping on for"
"628610","632490"," about a week or two now, wage price spiral. "
"633250","636270"," So not just wages going up, but inflation becoming embedded."
"637350","639410"," And those two things are there."
"640750","645330"," Even if all the numbers aren't saying them yet, some of the numbers actually are some of the"
"645330","649230"," researchers saying, you know, that that stuff is there and they're going to fudge these numbers"
"649230","653090"," until they either declare victory, which was bullshit. "
"654450","657890"," Or if they actually hit us with more rate increases."
"658670","667050"," And yesterday, what's coming off from them, which scares the shit out of me, is that they're going"
"667050","670190"," to declare a fucking success."
"670750","671850"," They're going to go into the selection season. "
"672630","674230"," They're going to declare that they beat inflation."
"675030","679690"," You're going to get inflation embedded in, it's never coming back down."
"679850","681410"," You're fucked as of right now. "
"681670","689350"," And the brutal part here is he addressed these two topics that I harped on for a couple weeks here."
"689850","691530"," He addressed those in particular."
"692550","696910"," So I don't know, I know that they have AI that watches people that track the F's and P 500. "
"697630","702330"," I doubt he's watching what we do here, but he never know that they could have that they're you"
"702330","708030"," know, I'll talk about this later, but Fed uses AI right now heavily to monitor and follow social"
"708030","712950"," media, people that are make the discussion and that stuff."
"713170","716190"," And they discussed that stuff yesterday."
"716190","719070"," So I believe those are still there. "
"719210","724330"," We're going to delve into those in the next coming weeks, because if they're going to follow this"
"724330","729070"," track, inflation is, is, you know, you've succeeded in beat inflation."
"729250","730690"," And they've already done the damage."
"730690","732410"," And there's no wage price spiral. "
"732850","733550"," We know that's bullshit."
"734370","735750"," We know I know it's bullshit."
"735870","736630"," You know, it's bullshit. "
"736730","737810"," You know, it's fucking scam."
"738110","744350"," So as a matter of fact, what else was funny was drunken Miller saying the same fucking thing."
"744930","748430"," So and I agree with drunk on this 100 fucking percent. "
"749110","750450"," And we can go to the moon."
"751870","755290"," The reasons we can go to the moon are not the good reasons."
"755790","764730"," The reasons we go to the moon is because when you get embedded inflation, when you get like a hey,"
"764890","770790"," we beat in we beat inflation and yet these wages are just screaming higher, it's going to make the"
"770790","771830"," stock market cheaper. "
"772870","774610"," So does that make sense to you?"
"774730","780170"," So if you had a hundred dollars today, that hundred dollars is not worth a hundred dollars in a"
"780170","782810"," year, it's only worth 50, right?"
"782810","785730"," Then the price of Apple needs to go higher, right?"
"786230","791590"," Regardless of what you think about Apple, because that hundred dollars is worth 50 now a year"
"791590","791910"," later."
"792470","797230"," And you'll see the market chase that in the next four to five years to the upside."
"797570","798490"," Major moves to the upside. "
"799570","802950"," There are some consequences to this that you're going to end up paying for."
"803030","808270"," And that is the older generation holding those purse strings, not willing to give them up."
"808750","811010"," They control all the wealth in this country. "
"811430","813810"," And that's what they're deciding to do right now."
"813930","814910"," I want you to understand that."
"815210","822890"," You're a young person, but I want you to understand that you're getting thrown down the river. "
"823790","825150"," It's going to be your problem."
"825290","831710"," That's what's happening right now as of yesterday's fed speech in my opinion that you basically"
"831710","833430"," have old people that are going to say, fuck you."
"834030","835070"," This is where we're going. "
"835810","840870"," Old wealthy people, not old people trying to make retirement and all that kind of stuff."
"840870","842170"," About rich people."
"842390","846590"," So we'll talk about that more tomorrow, but not today. "
"846850","853330"," The key point for today, the thing that you need to understand today is where we are and its"
"853330","854130"," implications."
"854950","864930"," So just on a baseline, there's no reason here to be extremely"
"864930","865590"," bullish."
"868030","877070"," And the real danger here is you know, we talk about the old, the old swallers, right?"
"877230","881390"," The old guys, the old sellers, they are sitting up here throwing rocks down, right?"
"882210","885010"," Through some more rocks down here, through some more rocks down here. "
"885270","886490"," And they love it up here, right?"
"887290","890770"," You just get up here, grab some liquidity and boom all the way down."
"891790","893010"," Same thing over here, right?"
"893210","896810"," Grab some liquidity, boom all the way down, throw, throw the boulders down."
"897690","900270"," And we're kind of right back in that position again, right?"
"900410","906270"," We're right in that area where it's like prime, prime, prime to be sending us back down and"
"906270","909190"," confirming the risk off scenario. "
"909750","918110"," Now, we went for risk off the moment that the daily trigger across the weekly trigger right here."
"918410","919570"," Don't lose sight of that, okay?"
"920150","921930"," It's an important thing for you to understand."
"923530","931070"," The second point to understand is if this does reject at any point, we start heading lower below"
"931070","936950"," this daily trigger, that would be your confirmation to exit the market and that we are an actual"
"936950","939630"," risk off, a major risk off environment. "
"940770","949450"," So in the next week, two weeks here, whatever price action takes place here is going to be a huge"
"949450","953190"," indicator for the market direction for the rest of the year."
"954490","961410"," If we reject here or if we consolidate and begin to leg up, if we can begin to burn all"
"961410","965970"," this stuff up here, come back down, catch the daily and the hourly trigger and start heading to the"
"965970","966310"," upside."
"967970","973970"," Now, saying all that, this is the place, right?"
"974170","978230"," For if you're a bull to take your money and run, believe it or not, I don't know if you"
"978230","978810"," know this or not. "
"979110","984070"," If you're a bull, you take your money and run in here, then you wait for the market to show"
"984070","985410"," you the direction that we're going to head."
"985550","987090"," Is it up or is it down?"
"988410","991310"," When what is it next week, too, is the next big question."
"992310","996490"," We'll get into what the expectation is for next week because I have an answer for you if you want"
"996490","996650"," it. "
"996830","1002690"," Now, the Weevil chart, this is the chart that I left you with on, or this is, I moved all"
"1002690","1005550"," this shit here, but this is the chart that I left you with on Friday."
"1006370","1007330"," So, everybody was panicking."
"1008090","1010130"," This is the path we ended up taking, right?"
"1010950","1017730"," Came up here and then boom all the way up and had an extension today based upon the Jerome Powell"
"1017730","1022250"," meeting, the Volcrash and all the other stuff that was said yesterday. "
"1022950","1024970"," Squeezed all up to this weekly trigger right here."
"1025970","1028250"," And the question becomes where we go from here?"
"1028250","1029550"," Are we going up or are we going down?"
"1030670","1032349"," Where to next cap?"
"1032910","1034390"," Big questions there, right?"
"1035069","1042910"," The logical thing for you as a bull is to be looking for a pullback just off the cuff right"
"1042910","1047290"," where we are right now for a pullback down to 422."
"1047290","1050890"," And this whole squeeze gets erased right here. "
"1051150","1056070"," I know you don't want it to get erased, but that's the safe thing right here is to be taking"
"1056070","1057050"," that trade down here."
"1057250","1067150"," Now, saying that we got a bunch more to look at because we got a bunch more to talk about,"
"1067150","1069830"," we got a bunch to talk about with this half-hour trigger moving higher."
"1070430","1072990"," We got some gaps down below here where this half-hour trigger is. "
"1073550","1079570"," And this hourly trigger can pop and create a super cluster that could send us even higher into next"
"1079570","1079830"," week."
"1082090","1083470"," Let's do one quick second here."
"1084270","1085970"," We're going to talk about a couple things here. "
"1090190","1098030"," We're going to bring what I want to show you here."
"1103780","1106080"," I'm going to read something to you right now."
"1108980","1115040"," Yields are at the short and long and decline dramatically on Wednesday, driven by better than"
"1115040","1121520"," feared treasury refunding announcement, weak ISM data in a very tame and predictable bed statement. "
"1122760","1124080"," There are some points here."
"1125520","1129700"," All the large gamma strikes are behind us and the path is now clear to rally higher."
"1130340","1135480"," Applied dealer gamma is still what was negative within the flip positive at 4265. "
"1137080","1140580"," And it should lend support to upside momentum."
"1141620","1144780"," Dealers will buy any move higher."
"1145680","1150760"," Another note would be that systematic CTA positioning and equities is ultra short, which means that"
"1150760","1153680"," the potential for the upside is potentially dramatic. "
"1154860","1160240"," So this, we are at historical shorts right now by CTA."
"1160360","1162320"," I don't have the chart in front of me, but I wish I did."
"1162440","1167200"," I had a bar chart to show you I don't have it in front of me right now, but we're"
"1167200","1168960"," at like a max short right now. "
"1170340","1174940"," The potentially upside is dramatic, even though the triggers are still a little bit out of money,"
"1174940","1177240"," you'll likely kick in full force next week."
"1177940","1181900"," So next week we have potential to move dramatically higher."
"1183300","1187640"," The kicker here is that according to Goldman Sachs, global CTA's are short almost 300 billion worth"
"1187640","1194700"," of global bonds and could buy 31 billion dollars this week and 425 billion over the next month. "
"1195840","1201860"," Should bond substantially rally higher equities could experience a massive boost as well."
"1203240","1206040"," Um, seasonality also speaks with this."
"1206400","1208600"," So we're going to talk about seasonality really quick. "
"1209180","1216200"," I'm going to show you a seasonality chart and I'm going to give you a quick seasonality chart here"
"1220990","1222310"," and hold on here."
"1222790","1230420"," Now we're going to bring this over and show this to ensure you guys this here."
"1231700","1237480"," Here's a seasonality chart that we're coming into right here and you can see this big giant bounce"
"1237480","1240980"," on SPX in this grind and then down and up. "
"1246660","1248980"," This is the seasonality chart for the rest of the year here."
"1249140","1256720"," So this is likely your Santa rally or holiday rally that you're looking for and you should expect"
"1256720","1260740"," the markets to be supported in this coming week."
"1263330","1265050"," Sorry, excuse me here for a second name. "
"1265050","1265910"," I'm trying to lose my breath."
"1275130","1276510"," Hey, bless to what's the love you man."
"1277070","1278010"," Thanks for supporting the show, bro. "
"1278150","1278630"," I appreciate it."
"1279590","1282130"," So here's the here's a key point for you."
"1284390","1289170"," Do the sellers come in and sell this down is the question, right?"
"1289750","1295630"," Is the holiday rally over and where can I buy a dip and all of those questions to be answered. "
"1296190","1303620"," Now we're coming into this weekly trigger right here and we need to close the day positive which we"
"1303620","1303920"," are."
"1304240","1306100"," As of right now we're going to close the day positive."
"1306600","1313120"," You're going to see the daily trigger begin to turn up here and you're going to see the half hour"
"1313120","1321260"," race up and the hourly race up or hold here and you're likely going to see any squeeze above right"
"1321260","1325500"," be sold off and down for consolidation. "
"1327500","1331780"," Okay and what happens in here is really what's going to matter."
"1331780","1339260"," So this whole zone in here does any of this get bought for next week and we can continue to"
"1339260","1340440"," go higher or not."
"1341420","1347820"," Okay, so if you are if you are a bull right if you are a bull and you're like him"
"1347820","1350020"," I just start getting long right here cap. "
"1350140","1351960"," I want to start getting long right in here."
"1352800","1356600"," The truth is there's likely some kind of a trap above for you."
"1358540","1361340"," There's going to be so just right in here. "
"1371470","1374310"," This is the kind of this is this red bar right here."
"1374650","1379760"," Let me make this a little bit right there."
"1381760","1384940"," So this high right here, I'm just going to move this over here. "
"1386820","1389260"," Let's see this previous high right here that we're looking at."
"1393160","1394060"," There's no one right there."
"1396700","1398920"," The algos really want to get above that. "
"1400740","1403460"," Even if it's just for a minute just a little bit of kiss."
"1407220","1410860"," When you see that one right there just that little bit of kiss is what the algos want."
"1411040","1415140"," The thing you just get above this this one right here we can come back and start to take out"
"1415140","1418960"," all these previous highs way back here like this one back here right. "
"1420340","1422060"," That's 451 19."
"1423280","1428680"," I showed you a chart last week too and let's just look at SPX really quick."
"1432110","1433310"," So I showed you this chart. "
"1433570","1435330"," I tried to simplify this for you last week."
"1436430","1437610"," You see that yellow."
"1438090","1439690"," I'm going to talk about this yellow one here. "
"1439770","1442170"," You're going to see some kind of a ricochet move to the upside."
"1442690","1443410"," We got it right."
"1443650","1444750"," It's right here that yellow bar. "
"1445290","1449530"," Now the next question becomes do we squeeze up there get that new high that previous high."
"1450450","1451730"," You see this one right here."
"1451870","1453850"," Try just trying to breach above it. "
"1454450","1459290"," Come back down consolidates and then we begin to make our way higher for end of the year."
"1460530","1466910"," Or are we going to come up here and fail right fail to get that previous high and start to"
"1466910","1470930"," make our way lower right how bad does that low become."
"1471650","1475190"," So the oh so for a bull if you're a bull right now the only thing that you need is"
"1475190","1479450"," that previous high up here you don't need to hold it you just need to squeeze up there and get"
"1479450","1483610"," it and back down consolidate so the market can begin to head higher. "
"1492910","1499350"," Now the JPM caller you can see this is the upside trend here going all the way back from October"
"1499350","1499810"," right."
"1500510","1505150"," We just made our way back up here again we're back on trend again right to the upside here."
"1506290","1508310"," You don't want to see that failure right. "
"1508910","1513430"," Watch that failure here and you kind of failure to get that new high it's going to send us back"
"1513430","1513930"," to the downside."
"1514390","1520270"," You see that previous high up here you want to see the market go up consolidates and continue up"
"1520270","1529030"," into that 45 15 for end of year right that 4515 that grind up into this upside move here into"
"1529030","1530010"," that JPM college."
"1530310","1532550"," So kind of a critical area in here right. "
"1532790","1533990"," Here's the JPM caller."
"1535190","1540110"," Here's that previous high we just talked about on spy and what does the market need to do it needs"
"1540110","1541370"," to grind up next week."
"1542730","1549490"," It needs to tag that 4400 by Friday even if it comes back down only to close some of this"
"1549490","1557290"," gap up up here right close this gap down here and then make that attack down below that 425 425"
"1557290","1563730"," to tag that 4515 for end of the year. "
"1565050","1568230"," So we'll get some others let's actually get a few other things here."
"1570900","1572320"," Let's get the MBI."
"1572320","1582180"," I have a little bit of a turn double bottom here turn turning up on"
"1582180","1588280"," PMOs and PPOs right this is this is all positive you want to see that that looks great this looks"
"1588280","1593700"," really good and it looks for a made it's looking for a major thrust to the upside as well still"
"1593700","1601960"," plenty of room to run here on the market breath indicator right for a nice rip higher right"
"1601960","1606540"," probably not done in here and I want you to see this right here I want you to look at"
"1608280","1614580"," let me look at this SPX chart right here and you can kind of see this right kind of see"
"1614580","1622200"," that nice fat squeeze above come back down for the consolidation and you've got the reverse under"
"1622200","1628260"," the shoulder boulder holder for this giant move to the upside right giant move to the upside"
"1628260","1634420"," planned out right here planned out right here kind of looks like I can do it right squeeze up a"
"1634420","1646660"," little bit more come back down and look for a dipeye and close this 432661"
"1646660","1655850"," so we got that all lined up right there let's go back to let me check me a second here"
"1655850","1665680"," so we're going to spy right here right what do we want to see"
"1665680","1674640"," happen here we want to see want to see this move up right here right just tag this come"
"1674640","1684620"," back down and close out this gap right here right it was like right here somewhere"
"1684620","1694660"," right in here I think it could be lower let's go with let's go with that one right there okay"
"1694660","1704850"," hold on make that one small right there and"
"1704850","1713310"," this could actually extend lower right possible we could get down there but it doesn't really"
"1713310","1731180"," matter to us does it really matters is does this stuff hold in here right there"
"1731180","1740120"," patience here see you can see that right there this would be what you really want to see if you're"
"1740120","1744680"," bullish if you're a bull you really want to see is you want to see that you want to see"
"1744680","1753220"," that new high rejection pullback right it can go here or even here come back up then we come back"
"1753220","1760140"," up here and start to attack all this nonsense and start to grind our way that way make sense so"
"1760140","1766320"," if you're a bull do you really care about the rest of this extension not so much you don't care"
"1766320","1772500"," if we extend above or if we begin to come back down right now you don't care about this what"
"1772500","1778280"," you really care about is does this get bought does this does this hourly trigger get bought to the"
"1778280","1788040"," downside let's take a look at that right here and draw that bad boy in"
"1788040","1797960"," right in there let me make that one green and that one"
"1797960","1803640"," green right there this is what you're looking for right there okay so what are you looking to buy"
"1803640","1813780"," in here you're a buyer you're not a buyer right here uh no you're"
"1813780","1821560"," a buyer down here whether this sells right now or not you're a buyer down here right uh you can"
"1821560","1828180"," also be a buyer if price consolidates in between the daily and the weekly as long as the hourly"
"1828180","1835340"," comes up and helps out um with a stop underneath that hourly trigger so this is kind of your buy"
"1835340","1842560"," right here this is where you're always buying this uh you never messing around with these daily uh"
"1842560","1849280"," and weekly triggers uh you can mess around these things if price gets above as long as price gets"
"1849280","1854800"," above you can as long as you get the help from the daily trigger the our app our trigger the"
"1854800","1860020"," hourly trigger which they're coming up right now they're heading up there uh but otherwise you're"
"1860020","1863980"," not a buyer here you're a bull you're not buying this they're going to try to sell you on this"
"1863980","1871020"," you're going to try to buy this down here if price does get a above though say price gets above"
"1871020","1875640"," the weekly and the one and the five minute come up you can take these for trips higher you want"
"1875640","1881600"," to take these but until that happens uh there's nothing to say there right so if we go to a"
"1881600","1886580"," one minute trigger here all right let's go to a one minute chart here let's have a look at it"
"1886580","1894120"," you know here that intraday you can buy this stuff as long as it holds so this is a price"
"1894120","1899840"," right now is below the one minute coming down to retest the five minute again if price were to come"
"1899840","1907820"," higher right price bounces and starts to come higher and you see and you end up seeing um"
"1907820","1914640"," you know this come up here and the one in the five minute trigger coming higher here and it"
"1914640","1920200"," confirms for a leg higher sure we can take that trade like an intraday day trade or something like"
"1920200","1925960"," that but are you going full account on this fuck no uh you're not you're either already long from"
"1925960","1931240"," friday and you haven't sold i've already sold if you want to know uh but you're either you're"
"1931240","1937910"," either you're either already long from friday or you're just waiting for that pullback you can"
"1937910","1943790"," slide this over here or you're waiting for that pullback another thing that you could be looking"
"1943790","1952230"," for is this half hour trigger crossing into the close uh for one more squeeze up into friday that's"
"1952230","1960550"," possible as well uh this 30 minute trigger got to push us higher and this um this hourly trigger to"
"1960550","1967290"," push us higher as well it's parked in here just waiting just waiting and then bam to the upside so"
"1967290","1974010"," what is my take on where we are is this just another chance for um sellers to step in and"
"1974010","1979890"," sell this down uh is the big question but we're going to look at the 30 minute trigger right here"
"1979890","1985210"," and look for some insight and guidance do one quick second here and see if i can get why i'm"
"1985210","1993860"," not getting this um over here slide this up here for you"
"1993860","2003720"," and i'm going to show you what it says to me okay so the hour is showing"
"2003720","2010380"," the hour the half hour in the 15 minute are showing some topping action we're not probably done"
"2010380","2018320"," going up but it's showing some weakness so expect any squeeze here to be sold off the daily trigger"
"2018320","2027340"," is saying we're just getting started bullish uh but it's saying to you to look for a roll down to"
"2027340","2036480"," check that daily right and then look for another another dip eye to move higher so from where we"
"2036480","2042360"," are right now regardless of where we go up i'm going to expect whatever up that is to be sold"
"2042360","2051780"," and then we're going to come back down to this daily trigger and retest it so 424 422 421 somewhere"
"2051780","2057659"," in here uh we're going to get a retest at some point down here so if you're a bull and"
"2057659","2064699"," you're looking to enter uh for the upside move the expectation here would be a pullback okay so if"
"2064699","2074420"," you're a bull you're looking to be a dipeye or down below it for currently 422 77 you're going to"
"2074420","2083239"," buy that dip so that's what you're looking for as a bull down here 420 uh 422 77 let's be"
"2083239","2092739"," a dipeyeer now let's see if let's see if we can look at where if we can find any other"
"2092739","2100750"," any other gaps here the only other gaps that i'm seeing just check spx really quick yes it is a"
"2100750","2105030"," little gap down here you see this gap down here nope wait a minute let's show it a gap down"
"2105030","2114940"," here there's still a gap down here you see this that's 419 giant gap left below here"
"2114940","2121200"," that's cause for concern uh this is 420 there's a little bit of a gap down here so there's a"
"2121200","2130720"," bunch of pullback gaps here these fucking bears are going to want to take all this out so if you're"
"2132680","2142610"," a bear here you're likely saying hey cap you can have your bull run up here but not before not"
"2142610","2148090"," just taking out that gap taking that gap out down here so is there potential for us to go all"
"2148090","2156990"," the way down here fuck yeah there is yes sir way right down there"
"2156990","2165840"," there's even a potential for that gap they get closed down there brutal right"
"2165840","2175520"," there's even the potential for that gap to get closed down that gap to get closed down there let's"
"2175520","2184460"," see that there start moving that up so where does cap want to buy cap wants to buy or right"
"2184460","2190700"," here this is going to be the bullish trade right here right come back down you get your v-shape"
"2190700","2197640"," recovery right here then we're off and running just tap on to buy this down here uh not not right"
"2197640","2203120"," now i wouldn't want to buy that uh i don't want to buy that i don't think we're going here"
"2203720","2209160"," but if we do uh i'd rather i'd rather yeah maybe we'll buy that consolidation but this is pretty"
"2209160","2215660"," bearish down here so i'm not i'm not a fan of this trade here the the cap trade here is"
"2215660","2225440"," going to be the cap trade here is trying to buy any of this nonsense down here any of this"
"2225440","2231720"," stuff down here we can leave these gaps for february if you come back and fill this shit down here"
"2231720","2237060"," for february i guess you could call up a double bottom right i guess you could say instead of the"
"2237060","2243220"," inverse head and shoulders this would be your double bottom i'm going to come down here and then"
"2243220","2250440"," you can take off and run again uh i'll we'll look at this again later for right this looks like"
"2250440","2255100"," the trap for the for the bulls you know oh yeah just do the throw bottom and then weigh on"
"2255100","2259740"," that daily trade comes down on top of you and you're kind of fucking we're heading to the downside"
"2259740","2267980"," so uh gamma's on your side if you're a bull we got a double top right now in the intraday"
"2267980","2278050"," let's take a look at that one more time and just take a peek in here there's a"
"2278050","2287070"," little bit more right down there have the mind to move this down there that's where i want to buy"
"2287070","2297050"," i want to buy 420 to 420 201 somewhere in here i'll raise"
"2297050","2305580"," it up a little bit i'm going to buy that green box down there now if this box doesn't hold"
"2305580","2315120"," here and we don't begin to make that turn that crank up to the upside all that consolidation going"
"2315120","2320280"," and get that move to the upside if we if we don't have the will to go up here it's"
"2320280","2328960"," going to get ugly so i'm not a fan of this lower buy i'm not a fan of uh buy"
"2328960","2335760"," and where is that it's not showing up on this chart i'm not a fan of buying this dip down"
"2335760","2344900"," here uh this this closing of this monthly down here i would be i would be grudgingly by that i"
"2344900","2353710"," want to see the will of these bulls continue in this continuation on into next week yeah there's a"
"2353710","2359610"," bunch of gaps down there i'm not going to lie uh i'm not going to lie that this gap right"
"2359610","2366510"," here is a problem uh this gap right here that one right there is a problem uh it's a problem"
"2366510","2372050"," child and we can go down here and bounce and keep going higher and stay bullish and all that but"
"2372050","2381950"," uh this the one problem the one flying the alignment for bulls here is this here and i'll tell"
"2381950","2386870"," you what uh under normal circumstances i would say yeah you could go up here come back down close"
"2386870","2392910"," this gap and then you're off and running but because of this right here uh there's extreme danger"
"2392910","2400690"," for bulls uh expecting this and getting trapped right here and then to the downside that daily"
"2400690","2409410"," chart comes down and you get sent packing in a big big way to the downside so do not like"
"2409410","2414790"," that if as a bull i don't like this dip by and i wouldn't be a buyer here if we"
"2414790","2419990"," go all the way down here i would need to see us get back above the daily trigger to even"
"2419990","2429870"," consider uh buying this dip this i i buying this dip is easier uh than buying this dip"

"3055280","3068800"," right"
"3084580","3093000"," here one quick second here"
"3093000","3150560"," something just"
"3150560","3160140"," like that whatever this extension is here to the upside come on here some walking is going on"
"3166880","3171420"," now if this does the pet does try to squeeze up here you get that good apple or anything like"
"3171420","3176080"," that it's possible you get that extension it's even possible you get the extension up into friday"
"3176080","3182000"," here so i'm not anti doing this not anti like hey we don't get the great apple er we go"
"3182000","3187600"," to the moon we go to everything is awesome with apple sauce we go all the moon and sell this"
"3187600","3194020"," down but i have no interest there my only interest at this point for me personally is for any"
"3194020","3199760"," squeeze up here to be sold down consolidate down to next week i'm going to buy this next this next"
"3199760","3204560"," rip higher so this is what i'm looking for in here for next week so the next three four sessions"
"3204560","3213920"," i'm kind of a pullback and take this all out then go up here and take out the actual four"
"3213920","3220420"," four thirty nine four forty somewhere up in here and next week for this consolidation i take place"
"3220420","3227080"," now this doesn't fit the narrative for s&p 500 this week is 30 percent of s&p 500 is"
"3227080","3231960"," reporting this week right and today we've got oh here we go we got apple we got starbucks we got"
"3231960","3239480"," shopify i guess the big question would become uh how do you trade this with these reports today if"
"3239480","3244180"," captain's telling you know we're going down you know we're going to consolidate down this in the"
"3244180","3250180"," next week and you're like super bowl here i'm assuming that you are assuming that you're all like"
"3250180","3257620"," super pulled up so if cap saying we're going down right we're going to go down into the reports"
"3257620","3266580"," after after hours here and apple stabilizing right now it's kind of going sideways now the question"
"3266580","3274060"," becomes you know what's what's really going to happen here are we going to squeeze up on those"
"3274060","3278120"," reports after the after at the end of the day yeah we can we can trade some zero dates we"
"3278120","3282980"," can synthetically trade that we can come in here and buy some cheap assets zero dates if they burn"
"3282980","3290380"," they burn if they print we'll get what two three four hundred percent on that trade right if price"
"3290380","3295140"," if price begins to hit higher over this weekly trigger and the half hour comes up in the hour comes"
"3295140","3302480"," up we'll trade that too if that happens but otherwise not full account trading here so let this"
"3302480","3307420"," consolidate my so what i'm going to do is i'm going to let this consolidate down into the clothes"
"3307420","3315160"," today right and look for some zero dates to buy on the reports after the clothes hold those for 15"
"3315160","3322120"," minutes if it looks like everybody's got great reports fuck it hold them into friday right we'll"
"3322120","3327760"," ride it all the way up into friday we'll tag that 434 11 we'll tag the 439 we'll get crazy"
"3327760","3334540"," now if those reports are bad i don't i don't lose that much right 10 cents something like that no"
"3334540","3341480"," big deal if price holds here like it is right now we can chase this iron we can do it"
"3341480","3349220"," right now together i'll leave the stream up today until four so you can run it up if we if"
"3349220","3355420"," we can i just wouldn't be i guess my my take here is um you know if you weren't in"
"3355420","3360480"," on friday fuck you you can be a fomo buyer all you want you're going to get 20 30 points"
"3360480","3368380"," 40 points um and you have risk of that downside move is is there all the time so uh we'll"
"3368380","3377140"," look at the one minute chart here you know where your dip buys are if you're a bull uh you"
"3377140","3382640"," know you don't short strength either so if you're a bear out there a seller uh do you short this"
"3382640","3386860"," right now nope you already know not to right you already know what you need to do if you're a"
"3386860","3392360"," bull or if you're a bear you need that cross right you can see it right here here's the there's"
"3392360","3397720"," a one minute trigger a five minute trigger right and you're not below it yet are you price is not"
"3397720","3403200"," below it you don't have a cross yet and you don't have anything here telling you to be bearish at"
"3403200","3410220"," either right uh the bot is telling you stay long here so until you get a roll to the downside"
"3410220","3417560"," you ain't got shit as a seller you ain't got nothing if you're short here you're wrong you you"
"3417560","3424280"," can't get short here until you get the cross to the downside until weakness is is prevalent um so"
"3424280","3430820"," for intraday stuff uh you can stay long here believe it or not you can stay long here until you"
"3430820","3438580"," get a rejection in a cross to the downside so if you can short this i'll show it to you"
"3438580","3446960"," i'll show it to you like crayons i'll show you straight crayon drawings how you get short here so"
"3446960","3454200"," you need a failure of that previous high right here see that one right there you need a failure"
"3454200","3465370"," right here so you need to fail get below right here then you"
"3465370","3473120"," need to see the cross of the five minute trigger and the cross of the one minute trigger okay you"
"3473120","3478560"," see like you know failure here right to get a previous eye right then you get the failure right in"
"3478560","3486780"," here right failure right in here and then we make that downside move that's when you get short now"
"3486780","3493480"," until that happens you shouldn't be short here you're you're going to get squeezed out uh i assure"
"3493480","3498280"," you of that uh this position of the market right here as it is right now you'll get squeezed out"
"3498280","3504680"," until this shows itself so you got no short here if anyone out there's telling you they're short"
"3504680","3508460"," they're out of their fucking minds if anyone on twitter right now is telling you that they're short"
"3508460","3515360"," they're out of their fucking minds they probably lose 70 of their trades so for you to get short"
"3515360","3524900"," here you need to see the role first otherwise this is bullish it's all consolidation the price is"
"3524900","3529420"," still above the one that five minute trigger we know that there are sellers above you can see them"
"3529420","3533000"," here they're right there and they're right there that doesn't mean anything just because they're"
"3533000","3538460"," stepping in there it's like auto bots auto-og or them selling here and we're in positive gamma"
"3538460","3543820"," right now all we need is for price to make a new high here you make that new high and"
"3543820","3549640"," we're off and running the upside again so we'll pay attention and watch it unfold the rest of today"
"3549640","3555780"," uh if you're a bull out there if you bought that friday clothes you bought that one third member"
"3555780","3560220"," one third in the afternoon friday the show we did if you bought that with me you just hang out"
"3560220","3566740"," and just chill you got nothing to do here just hang out watch the market and wait for a dip"
"3566740","3572640"," to buy that's at your pleasure four eleven four twelve four twenty four twenty three somewhere in"
"3572640","3578340"," there we see a pullback down to that half hour our trigger we're buyers there with stops below all"
"3578340","3584940"," right if you're a fomo bull and you're all pulled up and you're long as fuck right here you're"
"3584940","3590280"," still in control of the market right now so i can understand that if you begin to see rejection"
"3590280","3598100"," bars at four twenty eight forty nine get out of the way because then you're going to get sold to"
"3598100","3606880"," the downside we'll wait and see look for that self and i'll let you guys know if that happens what"
"3606880","3610980"," else i got let me read something we go through the comments here so you guys are saying here now"
"3610980","3619000"," and let me let me let me preface all of this okay so if you're looking if you want to"
"3619000","3626000"," know what i think so let's just give like the end of everything here put it all together for you"
"3626000","3633560"," okay gamma's turn positive again i can flip negative at a moment at a moment again i can flip"
"3633560","3641740"," negative here uh theirs are still macro in charge of the market here uh there this is their"
"3641740","3649320"," confirmation to a major downside bloodbath like a market crash okay so all they need to do is sell"
"3649320","3656240"," where we are right here hold their shorts and if we start to roll down and this consolidation is"
"3656240","3663560"," nothing but distribution nothing but a squeeze uh we're going to see some nasty downside moves real"
"3663560","3671880"," bad um so so on a macro farther out in time our bears are in charge they're looking to confirm"
"3672630","3681640"," the daily trigger through the weekly trigger cross uh if you are getting bullish if you're like hey"
"3681640","3690260"," kappa we're not gonna crash uh sky is rosy drone pals farting rainbows and shitting uh flowers and"
"3690260","3697060"," everything is onkydory you still need to see some some things happen you need to hold the daily"
"3697060","3705000"," trigger the weekly trigger you need the hourly trigger to push price higher you need the back check"
"3705000","3711520"," just like the bears need the back check the bulls will need the back check on the daily trigger on"
"3711520","3717920"," the hourly trigger to move higher as well so if we switch to bullish uh just like i tell the"
"3717920","3723600"," bears hey we're super bearish here but you still need to confirm that the bulls still have not"
"3723600","3729060"," confirmed anything so we're still bearish uh believe it or not you know that sounds shitty to you"
"3729060","3735360"," if you're a bull you're like fuck you cap i hate you um it's the same thing so the the"
"3735360","3742380"," ball is right now in the bear's court uh to sell this shit down uh for the continuation to the"
"3742380","3747180"," downside the doom and the gloom and all that other shit and uh we're gonna see three thirty six"
"3747180","3753700"," hundred and four thousand and we're gonna see i don't know fucking fucking stock market's gonna go"
"3753700","3757080"," to zero whatever fucking is you thinking out there if you remember this this is the conversation"
"3757080","3765460"," last week right let's talk about that real quick conversation last week conversation last week was"

"3791480","3798000"," great but it isn't uh it isn't until um they don't get that confirmation on that daily trigger"

"3804440","3811920"," crossed below that weekly trigger and that is still a um risk off warning to you until that cross"
"3811920","3818220"," on does unfucks itself until we confirm the move is higher uh that means even if we squeeze up"
"3818220","3824000"," we've come back down bounce back off and confirm that that move is higher we're still bearish"
"3824000","3828380"," believe it or not there there's still risk off warning believe it or not are you guys don't want to"
"3828380","3834280"," hear that stuff like i can already i can't feel it out there it's like everything is honky-dory any"

"6135130","6143770"," for apple critical to see okay even if we get the upside move we sold July of 28th we stayed"
"6143770","6150350"," on trend with their report same idea right here right staying on trend kind of notice how that"
"6150350","6157110"," major downside trend is to the downside we were at a major bottom though in this one on january"

"6166650","6174330"," of 2021 so apple you can see right here we're actually trending to the upside right here so there"
"6174330","6182770"," should be some expectation of continuation on that upside but even if we get it there should be"
"6182770","6188110"," some kind of a market sell up here you see that so right before and"
"6188110","6197990"," that would expect it upside target on the next expiry is up here"

"6256250","6263810"," marketplace i.e. right over here we're still likely to sell even on a good report so if apple has"
"6263810","6270690"," a good report you're going to expect profit taking up here would be the expectation even if that"
"6270690","6279090"," dip is bought for continuation to the upside they also have they also have a um"
"6279090","6289040"," a expiry on November 3rd so today is the second"

"6340670","6348710"," run and then a dip buy into next week down here so if you're bullish on apple into this close"
"6348710","6358710"," here if you think apple has a good report now note something here note that apple"
"6358710","6366150"," is going to require beats right and apple if they don't come out with anything that you don't know"
"6366150","6372430"," about stock split fucking apple car fucking i don't know apple vr something like that unless"
"6372430","6375930"," they've got some bullshit like that like hey we've uh oh by the way we just signed an agreement"

"6434590","6440590"," here isn't it you see that right there that big giant spike and that squeeze up and then the cell"
"6440590","6448920"," afterwards we'll need to see that right here see the big big giant but then you get the squeeze up"
"6448920","6454640"," right here right and then immediately sold down so the idea being here is even if we squeeze up"
"6454640","6463420"," here she could come right back down again right so this all looks good here this all looks positive"
"6463420","6471620"," bullish even though you've got some oversold conditions on the hourly the daily still has that"
"6471620","6478200"," potential to rip us into that upside so i'm going to give it to the bulls here on their report"

"6593080","6600560"," that's not true um when people tell you that's not true when whenever apple goes to the moon uh"
"6600560","6605020"," it's because they talk about stuff in their earnings uh they'll announce they normally it's"
"6605020","6609720"," normally it's some kind of a brief like a brief conversation like oh yeah we're gonna split the"
"6609720","6615940"," stock or oh yeah uh we need to make this announcement uh and they love to be the announcer of"
"6615940","6622520"," news apple loves to control the narrative so as they they're not saying they say stuff in their"
"6622520","6627260"," guidance all the time but if they have something to say they like to be the people to say it"
"6627260","6634780"," uh and no no one else to say it and i'll be honest here um i think they get a"
"6634780","6642460"," good report uh i i'm gonna tell you what i think that apple needs for that next level up uh"

"6649460","6656820"," this day i follow apple closely um but there are things that i'm looking for from apple so apple"
"6656820","6665500"," from my perspective uh if they're not going to get in if they're not going to get into uh making"
"6665500","6675420"," cars they need to be uh the leader and the only choice uh or it like the or"
"6675420","6684700"," fighting to be the only choice for um uh and believe it or not artificial intelligence inside of"
"6684700","6693860"," cars so um like apple apple carplay apple play everything apple does in a car right now needs to be"
"6693860","6703120"," needs to become the standard uh for auto makers outside of what uh tesla's doing i think that's"
"6703120","6708820"," their in road rather than make the car be the car so the insides would of every car out there"
"6708820","6714360"," the standard should be apple that's where i think the next step is for apple unless they have a car"
"6714360","6721200"," um i think they need to be the hey a car is not going to run without apple running in"
"6721200","6727060"," it like kind of like phones you're either an android person or you're an apple person you're either"
"6727060","6735540"," going to be an eel an eom company a shitty eom company you're going to be uh tesla or you're"
"6735540","6741840"," going to be apple i i know this sounds insane to you guys i know this i know this sounds"
"6741840","6751800"," crazy but i don't know if or the"
"6751800","6761660"," future of uh vehicles in general um they need to be that or at least take a"
"6761660","6767820"," take a portion of that business uh be that garden uh they have to do that if they don't do"
"6767820","6777080"," that uh this could be the end of apple um this could this could eventually become the end of apple"
"6777080","6784700"," in their growth cycles like if you think about apple and growth i get the growth in the um i"
"6784700","6794700"," get the growth in uh graphic design and film and entertainment i get all that i get phones uh the"
"6794700","6800000"," VR stuff that meta's doing right now is insane i don't care what you think i saw it i watched"
"6800000","6806520"," the videos i watched the i watched the VR shit they're doing it's out of control you can't get"
"6806520","6813860"," squeezed out by that right and if you're not going to make a car uh then someone else's car needs"
"6813860","6820900"," to be the beholder of your next thing you can't be living without right this VR in the apple garden"
"6820900","6829580"," you need your car no matter what car you buy to be that garden so that they have to make"
"6829580","6838910"," that jump if they don't make that jump bad bad looking for apple i know that this isn't that you"
"6838910","6844850"," guys understand what you guys discuss on the internet what i discuss is always different normally"
"6844850","6851670"," though we come around to that conversation apple has to be come that company they must you have to"
"6851670","6857490"," understand that when a company publicly traded companies if they're in then they come in and out of"
"6857490","6863170"," growth cycles right and they've done a great job with services but they still if they're going to"
"6863170","6868730"," be considered a growth company i'm not talking about next year five years i'm talking about 10 20"
"6868730","6877430"," years down the road you need to be thinking about uh how does apple stay in growth mode like okay"
"6877430","6882270"," you're we saw what you do with phones we saw what you did with services we saw what you did"
"6882270","6887330"," with the fucking watch and all this other shit remember google glass you guys forget google glasses"
"6887330","6893350"," right uh google glasses is a good one to look at uh i just did a retrospective and research on"
"6893350","6903310"," google glasses over a movie i watched a movie called um oh shit it was called um Jerusalem"
"6903310","6912650"," it was about i don't know why i'm relating this but i watched a movie called it was a shitty"
"6913430","6921730"," shitty beak a a b-class movie that got a wide release and uh punched higher than it should have"
"6921730","6928690"," for what it was uh for what they'd had for money what they did it it punched higher than it"
"6928690","6934370"," should have was it a good movie fuck no it was terrible it was awful but when a shoestring budget"
"6934370","6940350"," it did fine the key part about that movie was that google glasses were featured in that movie and"
"6940350","6947630"," uh when google glasses first came out there was this question about you know what is this the"
"6947630","6956850"," future or not right and um well now i'm watching this stuff on i'm still tracking meta and what"
"6956850","6964370"," meta is doing in the vr space and it's mind-blowing to see the so i posted this to you"
"6964370","6970170"," guys a link to this video on youtube on what meta is doing with vr they didn't scratch the uncanny"
"6970170","6977950"," valley like uh it's not touching the it's just above uncanny valley and that is the key with a lot"
"6977950","6983490"," of vr is is that does this feel real do i is my immersion real my break in the fourth"
"6983490","6989250"," wall with me and i don't feel right or i feel weird this new vr shit that we're seeing for"
"6989250","6996690"," meta is mind-blowing apple can't get left behind uh in this stuff they can't get left behind an ai"
"6996690","7000490"," they can't get left to whether it's real or not or how far down the road it is i don't"
"7000490","7005230"," care if it's 20 50 years down the road i don't care if we have to catch wait for robotics"
"7005230","7011370"," the soft robotics to catch up they have to stay at the forefront of this whether it works itself"
"7011370","7019450"," out or not and i think that they know that uh and how do they do that is my question"
"7019450","7027950"," is it a robot is it uh llms is it general ai is it through more hardware and devices what"
"7027950","7033130"," are those devices that are going to get used in the next 10 20 40 30 40 years for apple"
"7033130","7038690"," to stay in the race at least for this stuff i know that's like that's a crazy conversation to have"
"7038690","7044630"," but the reason i'm saying that is because apple doesn't want to get left behind in that growth"
"7044630","7054510"," cycle right which they will it's what jarring to say that like um as as that as we progress with"
"7054510","7061930"," this stuff in the next 10 20 30 40 50 years um you like you'll see companies fall off we"
"7061930","7069010"," saw it with GE you see it with me ibm i mean you can just name these companies so apple"
"7069010","7074330"," is in that same position do they become an a Xerox do they become an do they become an ibm"
"7074330","7080650"," do they become a um you know a past tech company or do they stay at the forefront of that"
"7080650","7090230"," race as that race tightens up that's going to become a major issue for apple over time uh"
"7090230","7096770"," into the future so i i expect that from apple my expectations from apple is you're going to hear"
"7096770","7102410"," crazy or shit come out of them from them and they're er's maybe not this this er cycle but in"
"7102410","7108630"," the coming er uh in the coming quarters i'm going to expect an explosive announcement at some point"
"7110590","7116830"," yeah companies have a life cycle i'm so fucking wooly and uh if they want to stay on that train"
"7116830","7124090"," uh for the next 10 or 20 years oh i expect some fucking crazy shit from them uh and if"
"7124090","7128330"," they're not that company we need to know it right uh we're gonna need to know it the next five"
"7128330","7134770"," years uh you see the race already taking place right you see Elon buying chips you see all of these"
"7134770","7144210"," made you see google you see um uh Microsoft you see meta you see smaller companies you"
"7144210","7152810"," see United States i mean it's everywhere right now right um so i know that you think it's a dead"
"7152810","7158130"," thing or i know like we'll come back in february and you'll be like all this this whole like AI"
"7158130","7164270"," thing is bullshit it's so far down the road that it doesn't matter but truth be told even if we"
"7164270","7170130"," do even if we do have that AI uh that pullback from AI or we fuck something up or break"
"7170130","7177010"," something it's still the future and you still want to see these companies um are they going to be"
"7177010","7188170"," involved in that or not i think apple knows that uh you"
"7188170","7192150"," know what i'll be honest i'm gonna be i'm gonna tell you guys the truth here it's not good enough"

"10016490","10026320"," uh they love to be tr- oh should i say this uh roblox is you know it's a retailer's"
"10026320","10036320"," it's a retailer's stock uh demand still keeps stepping in at $20 on roblox so"
"10036320","10048930"," i would expect that to be the accumulation zone it's every time we're down at that $25 $20 mark i"
"10048930","10056010"," like i like the ticker uh it's velocity and monthly weekly and daily it's a little bit long right"
"10056010","10065080"," now a little bit long in the tooth excuse me yes i can hear it we look at it other"
"10065080","10075470"," time frames here it's coming"
"10075470","10082850"," up in its weekly trigger right now uh you're likely going to uh trade that $38 $37.39 on roblox"
"10082850","10092330"," and ultimately your price target on roblox is uh that $50 on the top end though on"
"10092330","10099590"," roblox uh it's like right now uh it's coming into a topping because see if we can bring it up"
"10101350","10120090"," let's look at roblox really quick do i"
"10120090","10126890"," think roblox has a going for itself over the years yes is it a long road yes for roblox is"
"10126890","10132530"," it part of the future yes uh it's going to be a part of the future for these kids today"
"10133770","10140670"," you got great demand down below here everything looks great right you know known demand here 20"
"10140670","10150420"," bucks 25 bucks buying that 20 buying that 25 and looking for higher"
"10150420","10158900"," highs saying that though what do we know well we know that you buy the dip on roblox down here"
"10158900","10170410"," right we know that you're selling the rip up here"
"10170410","10181930"," right we need all this here this"
"10181930","10189510"," is roblox daily start here long term this looks great right you just buy the dip down here pretend"
"10189510","10196050"," we get a chance buy the dip buy the dip and you're still selling the rip up here right so"
"10196050","10202030"," the expectation is you're going to continue to trade just like this now you see this monthly"
"10202030","10211230"," trigger coming down uh if price at any point is able to get above this monthly trigger uh we become"
"10211230","10220110"," more bullish begin to close out the upside moves up here all of this stuff up here so for right"
"10220110","10224890"," now if you're uh if you're roblox like roblox you just keep set it set you know make a do"
"10224890","10234060"," it right hand do a right hand here and do you know they uh do an alert on a green"
"10234060","10239480"," box down here and you just buy this dip and take the money every time you come up here just"
"10239480","10243600"," take the money and run take the money and run take the money and run if any point it begins"
"10243600","10249480"," to consolidate and the upside will start talking about that next move up for roblox now this is all"
"10249480","10258640"," bullish consolidation here okay unless we break below that 20 dollars the expectation would be uh"
"10258640","10263060"," this is bullish consolidation for an upside move and you're going to be looking for price to get"
"10263060","10276750"," above that 50 dollars for the nod to go higher now on a 30 minute chart roblox hold on a"
"10276750","10285530"," second here on a 30 minute chart roblox is beginning to top out here on your daily velocity see"
"10285530","10294350"," that but there's still some more upside to be had the expectation here would be that we trade up"
"10294350","10303010"," and attempt trade this previous high right here right enroll this over"
"10303010","10312170"," on november or december up here at this 50 dollars possibly even roll down for more upside move"
"10312170","10318110"," right so you get the first squeeze up get the daily velo roll over and then the actual move is"
"10318110","10325150"," up later so you get this first tag right here your daily velocity goes to the upside right then it"
"10325150","10330210"," pulls back down right and you're going to look for that consolidation move higher so this could"
"10330210","10337750"," even be lower over here and then it's further out in time so let's take a look at that and"
"10337750","10350340"," see let's give some expectations on roblox you got that one right there that one"
"10350340","10360320"," right there going right up in there right so the expectation here is going to be we"
"10360320","10371060"," squeeze this up and back down to consolidate take that"
"10371060","10380850"," one out right there that's going to be your that's going to be what to"
"10380850","10390710"," expect here on roblox right there series of higher lows low"
"10390710","10399030"," higher low stand trend all to move up 49 98 we're going to actually go to 50 here"
"10399030","10407610"," then you'll take a bunch a bunch more consolidation down here this will cross up right here this"
"10407610","10413430"," will cross up to the upside possibly another down move so you get 50 bucks come back down trade"
"10413430","10425030"," that 40 and then back up right there actually pull that back down right here somewhere down"
"10425030","10437550"," there that help out maybe there"
"10437550","10447290"," you go that is that's roblox and I like roblox as a like"
"10447290","10456890"," if you I shouldn't say I like roblox on its own but I like roblox with I like roblox with"
"10456890","10463430"," like a basket of another 10 or 15 stocks so it doesn't matter which two or three pan out in"

"10682620","10690480"," expect that kids expect those microtransactions now that they accept microtransactions as a part of"
"10690480","10699900"," gaming and here's the scary part uh that uh that it's needed for great"
"10699900","10709680"," gaming now does that mean that it's needed for great gaming no but if I create"
